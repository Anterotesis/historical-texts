<P>THE CITY AND REPUBLICK OF VENICE.</P>
<P>In Three Parts.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHat hath hitherto been &s;aid of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> hath been either little con&s;o|nant to Truth, or el&s;e hath only mention'd the lea&s;t part of tho&s;e things which ought to be known. The time I &s;pent there, which was from the beginning of the year 1672. until the end of the year 1674, during the Emba&s;&s;y of the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> fir&s;t oc|ca&s;ioned me the Thoughts of making a mo&s;t lively and natural De&s;cription of this City, their Government, with the manner of Li|ving, and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> by com|prehending in the Three Parts of this Work, what&s;oever other Authors hath &s;eparately &s;aid of it, which, I can &s;ay, hath been ve|ry imperfect. The&s;e Affairs do &s;eem to me &s;o extraordinary and particular, that I cannot think them le&s;s different from the other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> than the Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> is from that part of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3">
Yet the better to &s;ucceed in this De&s;ign, and to draw an exact Copy from this admira|ble Original, I have not only applied my &s;elf to the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiries during my abode there, and to the Conver&s;ation of Per&s;ons tho|roughly in&s;tructed, with all the Maxims of this Repulick; but I did likewi&s;e con&s;ult their Chronicles, the Annal Manu&s;cripts of <HI>Venice,</HI> the Regi&s;ter-Book of Families, and the Re|lations which the mo&s;t experienc'd Mini|&s;ters have made of them<HI>:</HI> in&s;omuch that by adding the&s;e Informations to tho&s;e which I gathered from the Chief Hi&s;torians of the Republick, and the mo&s;t exacte&s;t Remarks of all the &s;ingularities of <HI>Venice,</HI> I ought to believe that I &s;hall no ways deceive my &s;elf in the livelyne&s;s of my propo&s;ed At|tempt.</P>
<P>However it hapned that the Author of the Hi&s;tory of the Government <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amelot de la Hou&s;&s;aie.</NOTE> of <HI>Venice,</HI> who was emploied in the preceding Emba&s;&s;y, did likewi&s;e re|&s;olve upon a De&s;ign much like to mine. His Book appearing when mine was ju&s;t rea|dy for the Pre&s;s, occa&s;ioned me to believe I had taken all this Labour to no purpo&s;e. So I thought no farther of the pains I had taken after the Impre&s;&s;ion of a Book, which had &s;o general an Approbation. As I know not the Author, &s;o I am not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with
<PB REF="3">
any partiality to &s;peak either well or ill of him: Yet as I am able to judge of his Book with more a&s;&s;urance, than they le&s;s conver&s;ant with the Affairs of this City; &s;o I think my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;ay he hath penetrated into all the My&s;teries of the <HI>Ve|netian</HI> Republique, upon which &s;ubject &s;carce any thing hath e&s;cap'd his Enquiries: But I leave others to judge if he hath not &s;hewn too much Pa&s;&s;ion, as likewi&s;e what rea&s;on the Republick had to complain of him.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd over Four Years, with|out any farther Thoughts of what I had written of <HI>Venice;</HI> I &s;hould without doubt have been &s;ilent all the re&s;t of my Life, if &s;ome Per&s;ons to whom I had com|municated my de&s;ign, upon my Return from <HI>Venice,</HI> had not engag'd me to go on with my fir&s;t Re&s;olution. The Draught and &s;ubject-matter of the Treati&s;e &s;eem'd &s;o particular and curious, e&s;pecially the Fir&s;t and Third Part, that they were &s;o much per&s;uaded, as they likewi&s;e induced me to be of the &s;ame Opinion, that the &s;everal De&s;criptions of tho&s;e Matters there menti|oned, were not le&s;s important to &s;hew the Maxims of the Republick, and the Genius of this People, than the mo&s;t refined Ar|gument that can be made upon the Policy of their Government.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
To give the ampler &s;atisfaction in what may be expected from me, as likewi&s;e to avoid pre&s;enting the Publick with a Work filled with the &s;ame things, that other Per|&s;ons may po&s;&s;ibly already have better ex|pre&s;s'd, than I can here de&s;cribe; I have thought fit to prune this of what&s;oever I had &s;aid of the Intere&s;ts and Corre&s;ponden|cies of this Government, with the &s;everal Potentates of <HI>Europe.</HI> I &s;truck out &s;everal Ob&s;ervations that at pre&s;ent &s;eem unnece&s;|&s;ary, and have likewi&s;e abridg'd the Chap|ters of the Strength and Revenue of the State; neither have I &s;poke of the Domi|nions they po&s;&s;e&s;s, becau&s;e tho&s;e Matters are amply Treated in another place<HI>:</HI> So I have particularly applied my &s;elf to what|&s;oever I judg'd nece&s;&s;ary to my De&s;ign. I have left it to the Readers liberty to draw &s;uch Con&s;equences, as may be ea&s;ily deduc'd from all the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential pa&s;&s;a|ges; and where&s;oever I have touch'd upon their Policy and Maxims of Government, it hath been with the greate&s;t Care.</P>
<P>My De&s;cription of <HI>Venice</HI> in the Fir&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e, will without all doubt be allowed to be very exact; and what I &s;ay of this wonderful City, will not be only as much to the commedation of it, as what&s;o|ever her own Hi&s;torians hath written to
<PB REF="4">
the Glory of her; but it is likewi&s;e &s;o ju&s;tly taken from the Life, that it will pa&s;s free of that flattery which is ever ob&s;erved in Authors writing of their own Country. In the Second Part, which is of the Government of the Republick; I have added nothing of my own, either in relation to the ri&s;e of <HI>Venice,</HI> the divers Revolutions that have been in the form of her Government; or as to the rigorous Conduct of the Council of Ten, and the Inqui&s;itors of State: for of one &s;ide I have faithfully followed what is found in the Annals of <HI>Venice;</HI> and on the other I have mentioned only &s;uch things, as might be known to them who have made any &s;tay at <HI>Venice;</HI> for one can &s;carce be there any time, without &s;eeing or hearing of &s;ome very extraordinary things.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Part I have render'd to the Antient <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility, all the Ju&s;tice that is due to their Quality. The Proofs which I have given of the Antiquity of their Extraction, may po&s;&s;ibly convince &s;uch, who either out of Ignorance or Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion do conte&s;t with them that illu&s;trious Advan|tage. In the Third Part, I have amply de&s;crib'd the Conduct of the young Nobi|lity, with their particular Cu&s;toms; and the better to &s;hew all the &s;ingularities of them, there is the manner of living of al|mo&s;t
<PB REF="5">
all the different degrees of People; to which I have added an exact De&s;cription of all the publick diver&s;ions of <HI>Venice,</HI> to &s;hew the mighty difference, between the reli&s;h of this People, and tho&s;e of other Nations.</P>
<P>I am of the Opinion, that the Method herein ob&s;erved will not a little contribute to the Beauty which I have particularly aim'd at in this Treati&s;e. I thought it mo&s;t Expedient fir&s;t to give an Idea of the City before I entred into the Ri&s;e of the Repub|lick, and the Particulars of their Govern|ment. I thought it likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome knowledge of the Nobility, before I &s;poke of their Councils which are the Soul of the State. And as the Cu&s;toms and Man|ner of Living of the Inhabitants do not le&s;s depend on the Laws of the Government, than the publick Diver&s;ions upon the Na|ture of the Place, &s;o I have handled the&s;e two Heads in the Third Part.</P>
<P>I did not think fit to draw into one Chap|ter all the Laws of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Policy, as judging they would be better di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;everal Places, according to the Subject of the Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;o they will be &s;ure to make a greater impre&s;&s;ion upon the Mind of the Reader, who&s;e Memory being fixed, and by this means a&s;&s;i&s;ted, will more ea&s;ily pre&s;erve an Idea of them. However, I have
<PB REF="5">
endeavoured to keep every thing to its pro|per Place and particular Chapter, as well to avoid Repetitions, as not to be oblig'd to &s;eek for one and the &s;ame thing in &s;eve|ral different Places. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons and to avoid tiring the Reader with tedious Digre&s;&s;ions and trouble&s;ome References, I have &s;o ordered it, that what&s;oever might &s;eem ob&s;cure, is ever explain'd by what hath been &s;aid before.</P>
<P>I could very much wi&s;h I had been able to write with more Politene&s;s, yet am in hopes that the &s;ingularity of the Subject will make amends for the faults of the Stile: and as I have no other end in this Treati&s;e than to &s;hew a great many things of which we were very ignorant, without being mo|ved to it by any other Rea&s;on or De&s;ign; &s;o I hope it will be favourably received.</P>
<P><HI>I only de&s;ire that the &s;mall pains I have ta|ken to bring this into our Language, and to divert the Inqui&s;itive, may make amends for what &s;hall be found ami&s;s in the Tran&s;lation.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The De&s;cription of the</HI> Lagunes, <HI>in the middle of which is &s;ituated the City of</HI> Venice.</HEAD>
<P>THere is &s;carce any one who hath not heard, that the City of <HI>Venice</HI> is &s;itua|ted in the Sea; yet it is not an ea&s;ie matter to form to ones &s;elf a true Idea of the particular Di&s;po&s;ition of this Place, &s;eeing among tho&s;e who have been there, and that have likewi&s;e made &s;ome &s;tay, there are many that do confound the Sea with the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> without ever ob&s;erving that the&s;e are ab&s;olutely di&s;tinct from the Sea; as being certain great Plains
<PB N="2" REF="10">
which indu&s;trious Nature hath purpo&s;ely over|flowed, de&s;igning to render the Situation of <HI>Ve|nice</HI> not le&s;s &s;trong, than agreeable.</P>
<P>Above tho&s;e Places, in the bottom of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulph, on the We&s;t &s;ide, where the Rivers <HI>Fo</HI> and <HI>Adig&egrave;</HI> fall into the Sea, Nature hath oppo&s;ed the Violence of the Winds by a mighty Dike, which runs from the South to the North for the &s;pace of about 35 Leagues, and 5 or 600 Paces in breadth, which defends the Country from being ea&s;ily overflown; but the Sea having forced this Neck of Land, hath made it &s;elf &s;ix Pa&s;&s;ages in &s;o many &s;everal places, which overflowing all the low Grounds beyond this Bank, gave occa&s;ion to this <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Lagunes.</NOTE> Name of <HI>Lagunes,</HI> leaving in this great Di&s;trict &s;everal I&s;lands about 5 or 6 Miles in compa&s;s, which are not much above the &s;urface of the Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lagunes</HI> lie from South to North again&s;t the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Continent, or</HI> Terra firma.</NOTE> main Land, from the <HI>Pole&s;in,</HI> towards the <HI>Po</HI> and <HI>Adig&egrave;;</HI> from the <HI>Padouan,</HI> to the <HI>Brente;</HI> from the <HI>Themi&s;an</HI> and <HI>Friuli,</HI> towards the Mouth of the <HI>Plavis,</HI> or <HI>Ana&s;&s;us,</HI> making a great Demi-Oval, which is clo&s;ed towards the Sea by the before-mentioned Remainders of the Neck of Land, being &s;o many natural Defences again&s;t the <HI>A|driatick;</HI> and whereby the Sea hath here made the &s;ame number of di&s;tinct I&s;lands, as &s;he hath opened Pa&s;&s;ages to drown the low Country, and form the <HI>Lagunes.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ix Pa&s;&s;ages by which the Sea falls into the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> are the only Ports by which one pa&s;&s;es from the Sea to this City. The fir&s;t, to
<PB N="3" REF="10">
begin at the mo&s;t Southern part, is the Port of <HI>Brondolo,</HI> which being almo&s;t &s;topt up with the Sands, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Adig&egrave;,</HI> and the falling in here of the new <HI>Brente,</HI> is now no more fre|quented.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the Port of <HI>Chio&s;a,</HI> an Epi&s;co|pal City, &s;ituated 24 Miles from <HI>Venice,</HI> and is &s;omething like it, by rea&s;on of the Situation and Canals.</P>
<P>The third is the Port of <HI>Malamoco,</HI> from the Village of that Name; here all the great Ships come, as being deeper than any of the other Ports; the Road is very good, and capable of containing a great number of Ships.</P>
<P>The fourth is the Port of the <HI>Lido,</HI> over-again&s;t the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Point of <HI>Venice,</HI> and only a Mile from it.

In effect, the diminution of the Waters depth is &s;o con&s;iderable, that formerly where there was Eight and Ten Fathom Water in the Port of <HI>Malamoco,</HI> there is not at pre&s;ent above Two or Three; in&s;omuch that the great Ships are now oblig'd to take the opportunity of the highe&s;t of the Tide to get out.

<P>The&s;e inconveniences being of the la&s;t im|portance, have put the Republick to an inexpre&s;|&s;ible charge within the&s;e la&s;t Forty years: They are very ready to hear all Enginiers that enter|tain them with the clean&s;ing and keeping the <HI>La|gunes</HI> clear of Mud: For which rea&s;on they have always at hand a great number of va&s;t Machines both to &s;cour them, and deepen the Canals.

<HEAD><HI>Of the Bridge of</HI> Rialto.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Canal that divides <HI>Venice</HI> into al|mo&s;t two equal parts, hath only one Bridge over it, which is directly in the Centre of the City, and in that quarter from which it takes the Name. This Bridge was Built of Wood until the Year 1587, at which time the Repub|lick, under the Doge <HI>Pa&s;cal Cigogne,</HI> caus'd it to be built with Stone: The greate&s;t Ararchitects of the Age were con&s;ulted about this magnificent Work; among the &s;everal De&s;igns, that of one Arch was preferr'd to all the others; which is &s;o large that a Gally with her Ma&s;t let down, can at all times go through it, and her Oars rowing.</P>
<P>The foundation of this Bridge is on each &s;ide laid upon 10000 Elm Piles, after having fir&s;t by a prodigious Charge kept up the Water in cer|tain deep places, until they had &s;unk 16 Foot into the Earth, to render the Work more &s;ub|&s;tantial. The Centre of the Bridge is but a moderate part of a great Circle, they not being willing to rai&s;e it in proportion to the Diameter, yet to a&s;cend the Bridge with the mo&s;t conveni|ency; it is very broad, and all built of very large &s;tones, not much inferior to Marble for hardne&s;s.</P>
<P>This Bridge hath on each &s;ide 2 rows of &s;hops, who&s;e Timber-work being rais'd Arbour like, and covered with Lead, renders the appearance of it very agreeable; there is in the middle be|tween this double row of Shops a &s;pace mode|rately large; from hence you go up &s;everal &s;teps
<PB N="18" REF="18">
until you come to the uppermo&s;t part, which is open on both &s;ides like a Porch, here you com|mand on both hands the pro&s;pect of the great Canal, and enter into the 2 Corrido's or Galle|ries, which being behind the Shops, continue from one end of the Bridge to the other: A great Ballu&s;trade, with very hand&s;om Corni&s;hes is the &s;upport of the&s;e 2 Galleries; the whole is &s;o re|gular a Piece of Artichecture, that this Bridge is of an extream advantageous effect to the beauty of the great Canal.</P>
<P>The publick Regi&s;ters a&s;&s;ure us that the Re|publick &s;pent upon this Building, the &s;um of 250000 Ducats, that for 2 Years all places of the City were filled <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Ducat be|ing about</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h.</NOTE> with Materials, and that a mighty number of Stone-Cutters were in|ce&s;&s;antly employ'd; however this Bridge does not at fir&s;t &s;ight appear to have been an enter|prize of &s;uch great Importance.</P>

<HEAD>Of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Ferry's or Pa&s;&s;ages for the publick conveniency.</HEAD>
<P>BE&s;ides the exce&s;&s;ive charges of building more Bridges upon the great Canal, I am of the opinion that the hinderance they would be to the continual pa&s;&s;age of great Ve&s;&s;els, and the prejudice that the beauty of the pro&s;pect would receive, may be allow'd to be &s;ufficient rea&s;ons a|gain&s;t all &s;uch attempts; moreover the Policy of this Government is that they may be able in any &s;udden Revolution, to defend one part of the Ci|ty again&s;t the other, which would be no difficult matter, &s;eeing there is but one Bridge to defend:
<PB N="19" REF="18">
But as it would be an extream inconve|niency to the Inhabitants, if they were oblig'd to pa&s;s the Bridge upon every <NOTE PLACE="marg">Li Tragetti.</NOTE> occa&s;ion of going into the other part of the City; &s;o there are for their greater ea&s;e, at lea&s;t upon the great Canal 18 or 20 e&s;tabli&s;h'd Pa&s;&s;ages; that is, &s;everal Gondoliers always ready at a convenient place to Ferry over in their Gondo|liers the Pa&s;&s;engers from one &s;ide to the o|ther, for which they pay &s;omething le&s;s than a half-peny of our Money.</P>
<P>There are many more of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in tho&s;e quarters of the City, where for want of Bridges the circumference of going by Land would be too large. All the publick Gondoliers are oblig'd to &s;erve &s;uch as will make u&s;e of them at the rate of 15 d. their Money an hour, which does not exceed 5 of ours.</P>
<P>The Ferry <HI>Gondolo's,</HI> having but one Oar, the Pa&s;&s;age is not le&s;s tedious, than inconvenient; for the&s;e bruti&s;h Gondoliers, are &s;o unrea&s;onable when they happen upon a Stranger that is igno|rant of the Language, and unacquainted with the Cu&s;toms of the Town, to Treat him with the utmo&s;t incivilities, telling one another in &s;uch occa&s;ions, that they have met with a <HI>Polander,</HI> being then certain to in&s;i&s;t upon the double price of what they ought to have, pretending they mu&s;t by the&s;e means reimbur&s;e them&s;elves of tho&s;e con&s;iderable Sums which they are oblig'd to pay the Republick for the Liberty of the Ferry; that is for the permi&s;&s;ion of keeping a Gondole to that purpo&s;e<HI>:</HI> Be&s;ides they are oblig'd to an&s;wer tho&s;e extraordinary contributions which is laid upon their Company in all the urgent nece&s;&s;ities of the Republick.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Streets and Places.</HEAD>
<P>LAnd is &s;o precious at <HI>Venice,</HI> that it is not to be admir'd if all the Streets are &s;o narrow, that tho&s;e of the mo&s;t frequented, will &s;carcely permit two People to Walk together; which is the occa&s;ion of frequent Jo&s;tlings, more particu|larly at the &s;everal Turnings, which are very numerous. Neverthele&s;s being pav'd with Brick, the &s;ide uppermo&s;t, free of Coaches, Hor&s;es, Carts and other Carriages, the&s;e conveniences of Walking are the more ea&s;ie, and make a|mends for the &s;traitne&s;s of them.</P>
<P>The Pavement grows &s;mooth, and becomes &s;o unequally worn in the length of time, that the lea&s;t Rains make them extreamly &s;lippery; but it is not the &s;ame upon the Keys, for here you go with le&s;s con&s;traint, as not being enclos'd be|tween 2 Rows of Hou&s;es, be&s;ides the&s;e di&s;charg|ing them&s;elves into the Canals, are much cleaner, and drier than the Streets.</P>
<P>You &s;ee at <HI>Venice</HI> the ends of &s;everal Streets moderately large, as al&s;o a great many little Places or Squares, be&s;ides tho&s;e that each Church hath before it, which are generally pretty large; as likewi&s;e &s;everal others of a more incon&s;idera|ble bigne&s;s. The want which they have at <HI>Ve|nice</HI> of fre&s;h Water, did oblige &s;uch as have built, to continue &s;o many little Places or Squares, that they might have in the mid&s;t of each a publick Ci&s;tern, which they improperly call Wells, as being only fill'd with Rain Water, convey'd to them in Stone Gutters from the tops of Hou&s;es, by the means of little Pipes or Funnels, that are fix'd to all their Walls.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19">
However, they do po&s;itively affirm, that there is &s;pring Water in &s;ome of the&s;e Wells, which is not altogether improbable; for that yellow and ill &s;melling Clay, which upon their clean&s;ing is thrown out of tho&s;e places, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tifie their argument; be&s;ides, Rea&s;on and Ex|perience &s;hew us there may be Springs of fre&s;h Water under &s;uch Grounds, as are cover'd with &s;alt Water.</P>
<P>Although the Water is not generally very good at <HI>Venice,</HI> yet &s;ome of the&s;e Wells afford that which is very good: But &s;uch as are de&s;irous of better, have their Water brought them in Boats, for that purpo&s;e only, from the <HI>Brente,</HI> which they pour into tho&s;e Wells to purifie, where it afterwards becomes extraordinary healthful. All the Dyers are oblig'd to this Expence in Water, more e&s;pecially in delicate Tinctures, for that of the Canals is only proper for their fir&s;t wa&s;hings.</P>
<P>It is wonderful that the Water &s;hould not be good at <HI>Padua,</HI> and almo&s;t throughout the whole Dominion of this State in <HI>Italy,</HI> but even much wor&s;er than that of <HI>Venice:</HI> I imagine this to be partly the Rea&s;on of their mixing the Wines with a fourth, if not a third part Water, that &s;o by the Fermentation of the Wine in the Ve&s;&s;el at the time of the Vintage, the Water may the better incorporate, which alteration renders it abundantly more healthful. Be&s;ides, I am of the opinion that the natural hardne&s;s of their common Wines which grow upon great Trees about <HI>Venice,</HI> as likewi&s;e in moi&s;t Bottoms, do's much more oblige them to follow this method; for their natural har&s;hne&s;s pre&s;erves
<PB N="22" REF="20">
them a long time, although mix'd with Wa|ter.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear ob&s;erving in this place the advantage the Country of <HI>Modena</HI> hath over her Neighbouring Provinces; for as that Province is very low of Scituation, you have the Water very bad when they only &s;ink to &s;uch a certain depth, but up on pa&s;&s;ing that, they find a level of hard Stone, through which they mu&s;t &s;ink, &amp; their trou|ble is not only rewarded with an excellent Water, but the Stone &s;erves them in&s;tead of Bricks for the Work and mouth of the Well; to which the Water ri&s;es in abundance. I remember one at the <HI>Capucins</HI> of <HI>Modena,</HI> which continually ran over, making a little Stream of mo&s;t excellent Water.</P>

<P>The Architect that rais'd the&s;e 2 Columns after they had lain a long time upon the Key, there not being any Engineers who&s;e experience af|forded them &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance to attempt it, demanded only of the Republick as an ample recompence of his labours, the liberty of Play|ing at all Games of Hazard upon the Steps that encompa&s;s the Pede&s;tals of the&s;e Pillars; which was granted him, with a con&s;iderable Pen&s;ion for his Life.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t Place of St. <HI>Mark</HI> &s;eems to be divi|ded in Three Parts, by the low'ring of the Pave|ments, and the Two little Water conveyances which &s;eparate them from one another: When the Nobles meet in the Morning they make u&s;e of the Piazza, under the Palace of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> as al&s;o one Third Part of the Place on that &s;ide: When they go to the <HI>Broglio</HI> in the Afternoon, they have the Piazza of the fir&s;t Wing of the New Procuratory, with the adjoyning part of the place; &s;o that part which they frequent in the Forenoon is defended from the Morning Sun, as likewi&s;e that of the Afternoon from the de|clining Beams of the Sun.</P>

<P>THe Palace of St. <HI>Mark</HI> is a large &s;quare Build|ing, one of the two principal Fronts where|of looks towards the Sea; the other upon the fir&s;t Place, as hath been already &s;aid. They are both Adorn'd with Two Porches one above the other, who&s;e Pillars and open Arches are of common Marble, but of an order of Architect|ure, not le&s;s Rich than Ancient. The Walls are quite plain, but divers Red, like &s;ome &s;ort of painted Brick, and di&s;pos'd into &s;everal large Quarrels of various colours, even to the very Pinnacles, which are entire of Free-Stone, and variou&s;ly Figured.</P>
<P>The Roof is of Lead, but very low, yet when this Building is exactly con&s;idered, the Magni|ficence of the Republick is apparent in all its parts. The Third Front of the Palace being oppo&s;ite to that which regards the Place, is up|on a little Canal, to which you come by <HI>Gondole.</HI> This part is of a more modern Architecture, and
<PB N="29" REF="23">
from the &s;urface of the Water, for about Twelve Foot high, it is cut in Diamond-&s;quare. You go in|to it by &s;ix large Doors, who&s;e Steps are covered with Water, the re&s;t of the Front which is an ex|traordinary height and length, with long Bal|conies on the Fir&s;t and Second Floors, is of common Marble, embelli&s;hed with &s;everal fine Works <HI>Bas Relief,</HI> and &s;o well built, that this part of the Palace &s;eems to be of one entire Stone.</P>
<P>The Principal Gate of the Palace, is in that corner of the Place which comes to the Church of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> it is a very Ancient piece of Ar|chitecture, embelli&s;h'd with many Figures; the entrance is through a long Porch, which on the Right Hand hath a communication with the Court; That of the Left with the Church of St. <HI>Mark:</HI> The extremity of the Entrance on this &s;ide, ends at the foot of an open Stair-Ca&s;e. The Court is rea&s;onably large, the three parts of the Hou&s;e are the three &s;ides that have been al|ready &s;poken of, and the Piazza or Gallery at the entrance, &s;upports one Story Magnificently Built, and contiguous to the Church, which makes the Fourth.</P>
<P>Round about the Court ranges a very large Gallery, who&s;e Pillars are of Marble, cut in Panes, and deep Pannels, &s;upporting another Gallery which is in the Fir&s;t Story, even to that without, which looks upon the Place; but no|thing equalizes the Beauty of the Front of that part of the Palace, which you &s;ee coming in from the Place, an&s;wering to that upon the Canal. This Building is not &s;o Ancient as the re&s;t of the Palace, but &s;eemeth to have been built in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Days of the Republick;

the whole height which is above the Second Gal|lery, being Adorn'd with Demi-Pillars, Fe&s;loons, <HI>Arabian</HI> Work, and other pieces in <HI>Bas relief,</HI> all which are in Marble of an extraordinary Beau|ty.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t remarkably fine in the Court of the Palace, both for the Marble and the Sculp|ture, is the Front of the Gallery, by which you enter; for here are &s;everal very fine Antick Fi|gures: but the <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> at the Gate of this Gallery which is oppo&s;ite to the Stairs, are Two excellent Figures. The Stairs are of Marble of one Range, and open, conducting you to the Gallery of the fir&s;t Story, terminated by Two Noble <HI>Colo&s;&s;us's</HI> of <HI>Sau&s;ouin.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Story of the Palace there is a ve|ry great number of Rooms, that look both upon the Court and Place, being even with the Gal|leries on both &s;ides, which are frequented for the A&s;&s;emblies of as many different Magi&s;trates and Officers of Ju&s;tice. A mo&s;t Magnificent pair of Stairs that begins at the Second Story in the middle of that part in the Center, leaves you at the fir&s;t Landing-place on the Left Hand at the Appartments of the Doge; and the next A&s;cent brings you to the Hall of the College, the Pregadi, Scrutiny, and Council of Ten; as likewi&s;e to the Inqui&s;itors of the State, to the Great Hall of the Great Council: In &s;hort, by a Labyrinth of Communications you pa&s;s through all the Rooms of the Palace, from whence you de&s;cend another great pair of Stairs not very far from the fir&s;t.</P>

For which rea&s;on this Preferment is always conferr'd upon a No|ble <HI>Venetian,</HI> who&s;e Revenue is about Five Thou|&s;and Ducats, be&s;ides an Abby that commonly goes with it: This Prelate hath Six and twenty Canons under him, who are all of the Doge's nomination. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a Seminary of young Men that are de&s;igned to the Service of this Church.</P>
<P>Upon the Principal Solemnities of the Year, e&s;pecially in the Holy Week, they follow the <HI>Rituals</HI> of the Church of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> for accor|ding to Ancient Tradition the Body of St. <HI>Mark</HI> was brought from thence, which hath given oc|ca&s;ion to this Cu&s;tom ever &s;ince, in ob&s;erving &s;e|veral particular Ceremonies. The mo&s;t remark|able is the Proce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Holy Sacrament,</HI> which is carried in great Solemnity upon <HI>Good Friday</HI> at Nine in the Evening round about the Place in a Coffin covered with Black Velvet. The Popes were never able to aboli&s;h this Cu&s;tom; it was formerly practis'd throughout the whole State, but the Republick have limited the u&s;e of it now to the Churches of this City only; all which at that time, make the like Proce&s;&s;ion within the di&s;tricts of their &s;everal Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more Glorious than <HI>Venice</HI> upon this Night, which is illuminated with Millions of Flambeaux, the Place of St. <HI>Mark</HI> being then one of the fine&s;t Sights imaginable; for there are two great Flambeau's or Tapors of white Wax
<PB N="33" REF="25">
at each Window of the Procuratory's, that &s;ur|round the Great Place: This double row of Flam|beaus regularly placed, with tho&s;e upon the <HI>Church Gate,</HI> have together a very noble Effect, illumi|nating all the Proce&s;&s;ions of the Confraternity, and neighbouring Pari&s;hes, that purpo&s;ely come into the Great Place.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Proce&s;&s;ions you &s;ee &s;everal Penitents di&s;gui&s;ed with Caps of Two Foot high upon their Heads, who as they march ju&s;t behind the Cro&s;s, do &s;o &s;everely la&s;h them&s;elves, that the Blood follows every &s;troke. They have for this purpo&s;e a Di&s;cipline of &s;everal &s;trings of knotted Whipcord, which they hold between their two Hands, and dipping of it in a pot of Vinegar, for that u&s;e carried by them, they whip them&s;elves &s;o exactly, and in &s;uch a cadence, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;tudied the Art to acquit them&s;elves of it as they do. In the mean time the whole City &s;eems to be on fire, by the great numbers of Proce&s;&s;ions, where the white Wax is &s;o little &s;par'd, that one would almo&s;t imagine they con&s;ume as much there upon this occa&s;ion, as might &s;erve all <HI>Italy</HI> a Twelve Month.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Mark</HI> hath another parti|cular privilege, which is to perform the Office of the Ma&s;s at &s;ix in the Evening upon <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Eve.</HI> They begin the Office at the <HI>24th.</HI> Hour. Two Hours afterwards they &s;ing Ma&s;s with four Quires of Mu&s;ick, in much Solemnity, and a mighty concour&s;e of People. The di&s;orders and &s;candals that were us'd to happen at this Solemnity, when perform'd at Midnight, was the occa&s;ion of the permi&s;&s;ion which this Church hath to celebrate that Office at Six.</P>

The Architecture of this Church is Antick, Solid and Ma&s;&s;ive, with Five very low Domes covered with Lead, a row of &s;mall Windows ranging above the Corni&s;h; the two &s;ides of the Church are a &s;ort of an inclos'd Gallery, and &s;eparated from the re&s;t; There is in the Ex|ternal Front of the Church five great Doors, Adorn'd with an abundance of Porphyr Pillars, and &s;everal other &s;orts of fine Marble; Above the Moulding of the Door there is a Caridor en|clo&s;ed with &s;olid Ballu&s;ters, that reach from one end, of the Front to the other: in which place upon the four great Pede&s;tals above the great Door, are placed four noble Hor&s;es of Bra&s;s, no where to be match'd in Beauty; the&s;e together with the Painting after the <HI>Mo&s;aique</HI> manner, which reaching from the Moulding of the Doors to the highe&s;t part of this Building, compleats the rich Embelli&s;hments of the Gate of St. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>The Beauty and Antiquity of the&s;e Hor&s;es have occa&s;ioned the Curious to make a &s;trict en|quiry into them; and it is believed that the&s;e are the Hor&s;es which when <HI>Nero</HI> triumph'd over the <HI>Parthians,</HI> were given to him to be put to the Chariot of the Sun, upon the Triumphal Arch, then con&s;ecrated to him at <HI>Rome;</HI> as may be &s;een engraven upon the Rever&s;e of &s;ome Me|dals of this Emperor; <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great &s;ent them to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and plac'd them in the <HI>Hippodrome,</HI> or as others will have it, upon the Gate of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI></P>

<P>This Church is built in the form of a Cro&s;s, without any ornaments of Architecture within; the Walls, as likewi&s;e the Great Pillars that &s;up|port the Body of the Church, are of a Grey Marble, &s;treak'd with Black, which great pieces are &s;o curiou&s;ly inlay'd, and &s;o rarely ordered, that one would imagin it to be the Work of &s;ome extraordinary Pencil; From the opening of the lowe&s;t Arches even to the Vaults and Domes, all is covered with Ancient and Modern Mo&s;aick Work, upon a Ground of Gold: you &s;ee in many places, very noble pieces of Paint|ing by the mo&s;t Famous Hands; the Great Al|tar, the inclo&s;ure of the Quire, the Three Doors within the Porch, are all of the fine&s;t Marble: in &s;hort, here is nothing that is not extraordi|nary Rich and Noble.</P>

<P>VVHat is commonly call'd the Trea&s;ure of <HI>Venice,</HI> is but in effect the Trea&s;ure of St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Church, which is yet divided into two parts; One properly belonging to the Trea&s;ure of the Church, and the other to that of the Re|publick. The Reliques compo&s;e the fir&s;t part; a va&s;t quantity of Jewels, as likewi&s;e of Plate, Ve&s;&s;els and Crowns make the other; all which are very carefully kept in the Church, as a mo&s;t &s;acred Depo&s;itory; who&s;e Keys are committed to the Cu&s;tody of a Procuratour of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> a Dignity that is by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility e&s;teem|ed in the hige&s;t Rank, as it will appear in its proper place.</P>
<P>There is to be &s;een among the Reliques of all that Religion e&s;teemeth mo&s;t Sacred, a great number of Gold and Silver Shrines, <HI>viz.</HI> of Sil|ver Ve&s;&s;els for the u&s;e of the Altar: But of all the Reliques which the People and the Repub|lick mo&s;t e&s;teem and honour, is the precious Blood that is kept in an Ampoule or Cruet, which with mo&s;t particular Ceremonies, is three or four times a Year expos'd to the publick view, by rea&s;on of the frequent Miracles they pretend do happen upon the&s;e Expo&s;itions, by Curing many po&s;&s;e&s;s'd People, which they bring hither from other places again&s;t the&s;e Solemnities, in a
<PB N="37" REF="27">
prodigious concour&s;e of People and Proce&s;&s;i|ons.</P>
<P>They have in the Trea&s;ure no other Reliques of St. <HI>Mark</HI> than that of his Thumb, which they &s;ay he cut off, becau&s;e he would not enter into the holy Order of Prie&s;thood, as thinking him&s;elf unworthy of it; and the Go&s;pel which they pretend is the the true Original, and of his own hand writing; but they only &s;hew, the rich Shrine in which they &s;ay it is inclos'd. But &s;ince the Tradition of the Country will have it, that his whole Body was brought hither, it is very &s;urprizing that they &s;hould have no more of the Reliques; yet the rea&s;ons given for it, are too &s;ingular to be pa&s;s'd over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>In the Year 827, under the Doge <HI>Ju&s;tiniani Participate Badociarius,</HI> certain <HI>Grecian</HI> Prie&s;ts that &s;erv'd a Chappel near <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in which lay the Body of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> were &s;o enrag'd a|gain&s;t the Mahometans who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Coun|try, for demoli&s;hing this holy Structure, upon the account of building other places with the Materials; that they yielded to the pre&s;&s;ing in|treaties of 2 <HI>Venetian</HI> Merchants, and deliver'd to them this holy Relique, which they convey'd to <HI>Venice:</HI> The Doge and People receiv'd the Body of St. <HI>Mark</HI> with an expre&s;&s;ible Joy and Devotion. They made him the Protector of this City and Republick, and rais'd in honour of him this Church, which being almo&s;t quite con&s;um'd by fire, was rebuilt more Magnificent|ly than ever, and afterwards enrich'd with the Spoils of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Conque&s;ts in the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>The devotion which the People and the Re|publick at fir&s;t conceiv'd for their new Patron,
<PB N="38" REF="28">
did apparently dimini&s;h; for about 270 Years after the Tran&s;lation of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> there was no body that either knew, or had heard where the Body of the holy Evangeli&s;t was placed; upon which the People and the Republick made their recour&s;e to God Almighty, with their general Prayers and a Three days rigorous Fa&s;t, and being a&s;&s;embl'd in the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> they be|&s;ought him with Tears, to &s;ignifie unto them whereabouts his Body was, and they beheld as it is &s;aid, one of the Pillars of the Church to open, from whence came an Arm of the Saint with a Ring upon the Finger.</P>
<P>All the Prelates and Principal Nobles then pre&s;ent, there reiterated upon this Miracle, the the fervency of their Prayers to the ble&s;&s;ed Saint, be&s;eeching him to be&s;tow upon them the Ring he had upon his Finger, in te&s;timony that his Body lay within that Che&s;t, which appear'd in the middle of the Pillar, from whence his Arm came; but as there being no likelihood of ob|taining this favour, the Noble <HI>Dominique Delphin</HI> out of much zeal and confidence approach'd the Arm, and ki&s;&s;ing the hand of the Saint, he receiv'd this precious Relique: The Arm return'd into the Che&s;t, the Pillar clos'd and the Ring was after|wards lo&s;t, through a great number of various accidents, as may be &s;een at large in the Chro|nicles of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>In memory of this famous Miracle, of the apparition of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> they have continu'd it as a Holy-day ever &s;ince, keeping it every Year with much Solemnity: Yet no body knows which is the Pillar that open'd and &s;hut again. However the People are &s;atisfi'd the knowledge
<PB N="39" REF="28">
of it is re&s;erv'd to the Doge, the Procuratour of the Trea&s;ure, the Dean of the Chappel and &s;ome other Officers of the Church, but that they are oblig'd by Oath never to reveal the Secret to any others.</P>
<P>In a place adjoining to that where the Re|liques are kept, they &s;hew you the riches of their Trea&s;ure, plac'd upon the &s;helves of a great Pre&s;s cover'd over with black Velvet, for the more advantageous appearing of them. The Procurator with the Keys &s;tands within a row of Bali&s;ters, which is at &s;uch a di&s;tance that one cannot reach them with their Hands. The mo&s;t remarkable things of this Trea&s;ure, are 12 golden Cor&s;lets, made like &s;mall brea&s;t-Pieces, &s;et over with very large Pearls, and an infinite number of rich Stones of different Seizes, as likwi&s;e 12 Crowns of beaten Gold, of the &s;ame workman&s;hip, with the Cor&s;lets, which do not weigh le&s;s then if they were for common u&s;e of Iron, and Musket proof.</P>
<P>They &s;ay that 12 Ladies of Honour of the Empre&s;s of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were us'd upon &s;o|lemn Occa&s;ions to carry the&s;e rich Ornaments on their Heads, but at pre&s;ent they are only us'd to adorn the &s;teps to the Altar, when the other riches of the Trea&s;ury are expos'd upon any great Fe&s;tival. There are likewi&s;e &s;ix great Rubies, although they are not cut, yet they make an extraordinary &s;hew, they are not &s;et, but run upon a gold Wyre that pa&s;&s;es through them: it is affirm'd that the large&s;t weighs &s;ix Ounces.</P>
<P>The Ducal Horn or Cap, being the Crown that is worn by the Doge, in the Ceremony of
<PB N="40" REF="29">
Coronation, is in my opinion the riche&s;t thing in the Trea&s;ury. It is a Cap of Crim&s;on Vel|vet, the back part being &s;omething rais'd in a round point, hath occa&s;ion'd to it that Name: The lower part of the Front is enclos'd by a Plate of Gold about 2 Fingers broad, which with the cro&s;s pieces that enclo&s;eth it at top, are cover'd with Stones of an extraordinary value; as likewi&s;e the 4 Angles within the cro&s;s'd Bars; at the point or extremity of it, there is &s;et a ve|ry fine Diamond, indifferently large, but very high; which was pre&s;ented to the Republick by <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> at his return form <HI>Po|land:</HI> Yet all the&s;e rich Stones are mightily ex|ceeded by a row of very large Pearls, that are hung round the Front of the Crown; their beauty and greatne&s;s do undi&s;putably render this both the fine&s;t and the riche&s;t piece of all the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>There is a much admir'd Cup, which is cut out of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Stone, that exceeds in greatne&s;s an ordinary &s;ilver Porringer, the out&s;ide foliage of the Stone is wrought into a foliage of Vines, both large and deep. There is likewi&s;e a little Paile of one &s;ingle Ruby, which is bigger than a com|mon Ewer; if I had not &s;een an expert <HI>French</HI> Jeweller examine them in his Hands, a&s;&s;uring them to be really what they are &s;aid to be, I &s;hould have had &s;ome difficulty to have believ'd them right.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are in the Trea&s;ury an in|finite number of rich things, Cro&s;&s;es &s;et with Pearls and Diamonds; great pieces of Plate, Scepters of great value, an abundance of Agat and Cornelian Ve&s;&s;els of &s;everal Figures, like|wi&s;e

&s;everal other pieces in rare tran&s;parent Stone, of one price, as al&s;o very large, &s;uffici|ent in number to make out an intire Service; which evidently &s;hews what hath been the mag|nificence of the Emperours of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the greate&s;t part of the&s;e rarities being the fragments of that Court, brought hither by the <HI>Venetians</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;ury had formerly many other things not much Inferiour in value to the&s;e, as a golden Chain of &s;uch an extraordinary length and big|ne&s;s, that 40 Porters were employ'd to the car|rying of it, as likewi&s;e 12 or 15 Millions of coin'd Gold, which was only kept to &s;hew the People and Strangers their great riches upon days of Solemnity, the Chain being hung along the <HI>Piazza</HI> of the Palace upon St. <HI>Mark's</HI> place, with a Cup of Gold between each 2 Pillars; the Republick were us'd to add every Year &s;ome new Links to it<HI>:</HI> But the War of <HI>Candy</HI> &s;wept away this Trea&s;ure, and the Chain became Se|quins in the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities of the State, du|ring which, &s;everal Noble Families found the means of turning the misfortunes of the Repub|lick to their own private advantages, which are to this day po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by their Po&s;terity.</P>

<P>THere is nothing &s;o famous as the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> nor any thing that does &s;o much demon&s;trate the Power of this Republick; it is the Object of all Strangers Admiration, and the Foundation of the Strength of the State: The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> values it &s;o much, as (by Report) to prefer it to whatever el&s;e the State po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth. It
<PB N="49" REF="36">
is of a large Circumference, being more than 2 Miles about, taking up all the Ea&s;tern Divi&s;ion of the City, from which it is only &s;eparated by a &s;mall Canal that wa&s;hes three &s;ides of it, and the <HI>Lagunes</HI> the fourth, that lies towards the North; it is inclo&s;ed with very high Walls and Towers at certain Di&s;tances, where is kept a very exact Guard, e&s;pecially in the Night; the Centinels can, by little Bells in tho&s;e Towers, adverti&s;e the <HI>Corps du Guard</HI> in ca&s;e of Attempts, and other Accidents of Fire that may ca&s;ually happen, or premeditately break forth upon the In&s;tigations of any &s;ecret Enemy.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t thing that was to have been executed in the Con&s;piracy of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Year 1618, whil&s;t the other Confederates attack'd the Body of the Nobility in the Palace of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> but Heaven prevented the Blow by the means of two <HI>French</HI> Men that had re|ceived &s;ome Hints of their De&s;ign, and imme|diately took Po&s;t to inform the Senate of their Danger: The <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> is &s;o important to the Re|publick, that there is not any thing which gives them &s;o much occa&s;ion of Care and Di&s;tru&s;t; for not only the &s;ecurity of the City and State, but likewi&s;e the greate&s;t part of this Republick's Power depends upon it.</P>
<P>It would take up a whole Volume to de&s;cribe all that is remarkable in the <HI>Ar&s;enal;</HI> therefore I &s;hall let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve in general, That there are in the &s;everal Apartments a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing quantity of Arms both for Hor&s;e and Foot, as likewi&s;e for the Ships and Gallies, all very neat, and kept in an extraordinary order; you &s;ee in one Room the nece&s;&s;ary Arms for
<PB N="50" REF="37">
10000 Men; in another for 20000, even to a third and fourth for 30 or 40000 each.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Care is here ob&s;erved in reference of the Naval Stores; for in one Room there are the Nece&s;&s;aries for 20 Gallies, another 30, and a fourth of 40: On one hand you &s;ee all &s;orts of Arms for 40 Ships; on the other for 10 Galea&s;&s;es. In &s;hort, it's almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to imagine what a prodigious quantity of Arms there is in the&s;e Magazines.</P>
<P>The Republick entertained <HI>Henry</HI> the Third in great State when he vi&s;ited the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> where the Plea&s;ure they gave him in &s;eeing a Galley fitted up and rigg'd out while he was at Dinner, was not the lea&s;t Satisfaction they Com|plimented His Maje&s;ty with during the time he &s;tayed at <HI>Venice.</HI> Under the&s;e Rooms there are &s;everal di&s;tinct Store-hou&s;es for all &s;orts of Furni|ture, and Military Equipage: It is reckoned there are above 800 Pieces of Cannon for the Service of Sea and Land; of Bullets, Bombs, Granades and Mortars a proportionable Num|ber; and even the &s;ame of Collars for the Ar|tillery-Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ts, Yards, Oars, Pulleys, Sails, Ropes, Anchors, Nails, and all &s;ort of Iron-work nece&s;|&s;ary in the building of Ships, are here kept in their &s;eparate and di&s;tinct Places; in&s;omuch that what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary for any Expedition of either Sea or Land, may be &s;een in the greate&s;t abundance. Without doubt they are al|ways in a condition of fitting out a Hundred Gal|lies or Galea&s;&s;es, and as able to Arm a Hundred thou&s;and Men; which would be more than &s;uffi|cient to allarm the greate&s;t Potentates of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="37">
if Men and Money were equally an&s;werable to the&s;e mighty Stores.</P>
<P>There are in the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> Three very large wet Docks, which are &s;upplied with Water by the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> round which are a great many Hou&s;es large enough to contain Two Ve&s;&s;els, and keep them from the injuries of the Weather; here they refit and build their Ve&s;&s;els, Gallies and Gallea&s;&s;es, which are not Launch'd until they de&s;ign to u&s;e them: The&s;e places are not only full of what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;ent Ser|vice, but likewi&s;e of the remainders of their victorious Armies, and the many Prizes they have taken from the Turks, in tho&s;e &s;ignal Vic|tories they have frequently obtain'd both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>By the&s;e mighty Stores, the Republick is ever able to fit out in a very &s;mall time a Fleet of Forty Gallies, and as many Gallea&s;&s;es; of Nine or Ten that are in the Docks, there is one of an extraordinary largene&s;s, but not yet fini&s;h'd. This &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els are equal to the large&s;t Ships in Length and Breadth, their Compliment con&s;i&s;t|ing ordinarily of 1000 or 1200 Men; in&s;omuch that the&s;e Gallea&s;&s;es may be truly termed floating Ca&s;tles, they having in a Calm all the advantages of the &s;malle&s;t Gallies; for which rea&s;on as the gaining of the Day u&s;ually depends upon the&s;e Gallea&s;&s;es, &s;o they can only be Commanded by Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> which Commanders are yet ob|lig'd by Oath, and to an&s;wer it at the price of their Heads, not to refu&s;e Engaging again&s;t Twenty five Gallies of the Enemy.</P>
<P>What&s;oever is made in the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> is of a Nature &s;o Sacred to all manner of People, as
<PB N="52" REF="38">
to admit of no Clemency upon the Embezel|ment of it; all things have there the Impre&s;&s;ion of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> even to the very Nails; and if any Per&s;on &s;hould be found with the lea&s;t of tho&s;e things, he would be immediately and without Redemption condemn'd to the Gallies. The Cordage and Cables of <HI>Venice</HI> are famous for their goodne&s;s, in&s;omuch that all others, are no ways to be compar'd with them: Yet I am very much of the opinion that their man|ner of Twining doth not contribute le&s;s to it, than the excellency of their Hemp.</P>
<P>They practi&s;e here the direct contrary Me|thod to what they do in other Countries; for he that turns, goes backward with a Wooden Wheel fa&s;tned to his Girdle, and he that twi&s;ts it is &s;itting, &s;o Working at his ea&s;e, he mu&s;t undoubtedly make a rounder and better wrought Ware, of which ab&s;olutely depends the good|ne&s;s of the Cord. The Ropery is the be&s;t of any I ever &s;aw, it is cover'd, and of a prodi|gious Length; the Breadth is divided into 3 rows of Pillars, that &s;u&s;tain each a Penthou&s;e of Wood, which &s;erve as 2 mighty Maga|zines for the Hemp all the Country is oblig'd to deliver here, at a rate prefix'd by the Ma|gi&s;trates.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;els that are built in the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> are of a particular goodne&s;s, e&s;pecially the Gallies, not only by rea&s;on of their Symmetry and ex|act Proportions, that render them very nimble at Sea, as being le&s;s than tho&s;e of <HI>France;</HI> but for their extraordinary goodne&s;s, which makes them la&s;t thrice as long as any built in other Places. The Ingenuity of the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> Builders
<PB N="53" REF="38">
gives them the advantage of the fir&s;t; but the ex|cellency of the Timber they Imploy in the building of them, is the principal rea&s;on of their long continuance.</P>
<P>The excellency of the Wood they u&s;e, is chiefly occa&s;ioned by the great care they ob|&s;erve in &s;ea&s;oning of it; for no Timber is wrought in the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> that hath not been at lea&s;t Ten Years in Salt Water, at the bottom of the wet Docks mentioned, where there is always a &s;uf|ficient quantity to &s;upply the mo&s;t extraordinary occa&s;ions of the Republick; each piece being mark'd with the Day, and Date, when it was put into the Water, where it &s;o well &s;ettles and hardens after it comes to the Air, that it is never after &s;ubject either to fret or fly in the working or u&s;ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> is Governed as if it were a little &s;eparate Republick of it &s;elf; they ob|&s;erve an extraordinary exact Guard at the Gate; the work People directed by Surveyors, are con|tinually making all &s;orts of things, that appertain unto the Naval Stores; who are yet only Subordi|nate to Three Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> that re&s;ide con|&s;tantly in the <HI>Ar&s;enal:</HI> the&s;e are chang'd at the expiration of Three Years, contrary to the u&s;u|al Cu&s;tom of the Republick, that hath deter|min'd the expiring of almo&s;t all other Employs at the term of Sixteen Months; but this particu|lar regard is ob&s;erv'd here, le&s;t the frequent al|terations in the Proveditors of the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> might not occa&s;ion &s;ome impediment to tho&s;e many and various works, which nece&s;&s;ary knowledge is not attainable in a &s;mall &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>All the Workmen are immediately &s;ubject to

<P>This Officer is the Pilot of that magnificent Ve&s;&s;el, and the Men that work her, are the Ar|ti&s;ans of the <HI>Ar&s;enal:</HI> As the Republick hath no Subjects more truly affectionate to them than the&s;e, &s;o they confide the more ea&s;ily in them; for the Admiral by an Ancient and particular Cu&s;tom, obliges him&s;elf at the price of his Head to bring back the <HI>Bucentaure,</HI> without ever run|ning any hazard of being overtaken by a Storm; for which rea&s;on at the lea&s;t appearance of an un&s;ettl'd Day, he never goes far beyond the Mouth of the <HI>Lido,</HI> or rather defers the Ceremo|ny to a more proper opportunity.</P>
<P>There is in the <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> al&s;o an Intendant of the Military Engines and Forges, as likewi&s;e all o|ther Mechanical Inventions, either u&s;eful in War, or to the &s;cowring of the <HI>Lagunes;</HI> they are ever finding out &s;ome new Inventions of the&s;e kinds, which are referr'd to the examination of this Per&s;on.

hath another that mounts them with an incredi|ble ea&s;e, and a &s;cale that is very ju&s;t and exact, for the weighing of the greate&s;t Pieces.</P>
<P>In time of Peace the Republick does not maintain above Five hundred Workmen in the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> but in a War they augment the number to Two thou&s;and or more. To engage the&s;e People the more to their Service, they are con|&s;tantly kept in pay, allowing to their Children &s;ome &s;mall matter &s;o &s;oon as they are capable of the &s;malle&s;t Services, by untwi&s;ting of old Cords and drawing out of Hemp, and as they grow up, &s;o they find a proportionable augmentation: By which means they continue to follow from Father to Son the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, which does not only render them very expert in their bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but they likewi&s;e are very well affected to the Republick, who recompences them accord|ing to their merits, the only means by which they arrive to the Command of others.</P>

<PB N="56" REF="40">
breadth, and &s;et with the edge forwards; the up|per part of this Iron is con&s;iderably broader than the re&s;t, being advanc'd out like the head of a great Cleaver that is &s;omething better than a Foot broad; &s;o dividing the Air by the &s;wift motion of the Gondola, it looks as if it would cut down what&s;oever oppo&s;eth its pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<P><PB N="57" REF="40">
The Gondolaes are not built of this great length &s;o much for the conveniency of Carriage, as for the dextrous working of them; their head is built up like a litle Ridge, which returns equally &s;loping to the &s;ides; the Prow is round at bot|tom, and totally rai&s;ed out of the Water; for the greater expedition it is likewi&s;e rai&s;ed and co|vered as the Head; The whole Body of the Gondola is &s;o neatly rubb'd over with a mixture of Pitch and Oil, that it perfectly looks like Var|ni&s;h: Under the Water they are tallowed with black Grea&s;e, that gives them an extraordinary ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age through the Water, they &s;eem to divide.</P>
<P>When they fit out a Gondola, they &s;pread a long Carpet at the bottom of it, upon Planks that are very well joyn'd, which reach from the Poop unto the Two Steps at the cover'd part of the Head end, which are there made for the conveniency of coming in and going out. They fix in the middle of the Gondola, a covering of about Eight Foot long, under which one may &s;tand upright. This is &s;upported by Two great Demi-Circles, who&s;e Four ends being pointed, are fixed into as many niches in the &s;ides; &s;eve|ral long &s;ticks hand&s;omly turn'd at the ends, are fa&s;tned at the top of the Cir|cles <NOTE PLACE="marg">Il felee.</NOTE> that &s;upport the Tilt, which is upon occa&s;ion, ca&s;t over all the re&s;t to defend them from the in|juries of the Weather.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Trade that remaineth now to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> are only tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> and <HI>Germany:</HI> For which rea&s;on the vend|ing of their rich Silks, and other principal Ma|nufactures, is of the la&s;t importance to them; therefore they continue the&s;e Trades with the greate&s;t application.

<P>It is hardly to be believed what great quantities of Brouards, Damasks, and Cloaths of Gold that the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> do continually &s;end From hence to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> to maintain this important Commerce be|tween the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the Subjects of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> the Republick doth upon all occa&s;ions &s;hew the greate&s;t regards to tho&s;e of that Nation inhabiting among them; They have given them an Old Palace upon the great Canal, in which all the <HI>Turks</HI> live together, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Il Palazzo di Turchi.</NOTE> having &s;ufficient Warehou&s;e-room for &s;uch Merchandizes they export; as likewi&s;e for their Leathers, Wax and Silk, which they bring in great quantities from the <HI>Levant;</HI> but if there happen any difference between them and the Subjects of the Republick, in which the former think them&s;elves injur'd, they demand &s;atisfaction in &s;uch an extraordinary manner, and receive it &s;o readily, that one would almo&s;t believe they dare not venture to refu&s;e it to them.</P>
<P>To render this Commerce more a&s;&s;ured and ea&s;y, they have invented a particular Model of a Ve&s;&s;el, that is properly a Demi-Galea&s;&s;e, here call'd the <HI>Traffique-Gally,</HI> which carries to <HI>Spalatro</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> at a Crown <HI>per</HI> Piece, the Bales of all the Traders in this City; from whence they are carried upon Camels to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and

<P>The Commerce they have with <HI>Germany,</HI> is the fir&s;t and the mo&s;t ancient this City hath had; which being not much le&s;s advantagious to the State than that of the <HI>Levant,</HI> &s;o they have omitted nothing that might contribute to the pre&s;ervation of it; to which purpo&s;e the Repub|lick hath accommodated the <HI>German</HI> Merchants with a very hand&s;om and ancient Palace near the Bridge of <HI>Rialto,</HI> in which they keep their Warehou&s;e: The Traders of that Nation are very conveniently Lodg'd there, and at a very ea&s;y Rate, enjoying many extraordinary Privi|leges, which do very much contribute to the im|provement of this Commerce.</P>
<P>This Palace is finely Painted on the out&s;ide by <HI>Georgeon</HI> and <HI>Titien;</HI> but much decayed at pre|&s;ent, yet there remaineth &s;everal noble Frag|ments; what is mo&s;t valuable in this Magazine, is a Hanging of Gilt Leather, with &s;everal Fi|gures, all done by <HI>Paul Verone&s;e,</HI> which is un|doubtedly one of the be&s;t Pieces this Famous Painter ever did.</P>

<P>The Mi&s;ts that are u&s;ually here in the begin|ning of the Winters do often continue for &s;everal
<PB N="69" REF="49">
days together, &s;o thick and cold, that they are not to be endur'd in any other place, without very great inconveniencies; In Summer the Tem|pe&s;ts and extream heats are &s;o very frequent, and &s;o &s;uddenly interrupted with cold Winds, Rains and Storms, that it is much to be admired, that in a City where they are not us'd to have three days of one continu'd weather, yet they &s;hould enjoy an Air, incomparably more &s;weet and healthful, than tho&s;e we find in the more agree|able and temperate Climates.</P>
<P>The pernicious Effects of the Evening Air that reigns in all other parts of <HI>Italy</HI> are altogether unknown at <HI>Venice;</HI> Old and Young go bare-headed here Night and Day, both Win|ter and Summer, without the lea&s;t inconveni|encies; and by the particular benignity of the Air, Rheums and Defluxions are le&s;s frequent here, than in any other place I ever knew; one cannot de&s;ire a greater demon&s;tration of this Truth, than by what may be ob&s;erv'd in the Churches, or in any other great concour&s;e of the People, where during the &s;ea&s;ons mo&s;t liable to Coughs and Colds, it is very rare to hear the lea&s;t &s;ymptomes of them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to the goodne&s;s of the Air is due the Colour and Complexions of both Men and Wo|men, which are much better and more lively than tho&s;e who live at <HI>Rome;</HI> as likewi&s;e in mo&s;t parts of the other Cities of <HI>Italy:</HI> Their Teeth are &s;ound and white; their Heads are well co|vered with good full Hair, which grows very fa&s;t, e&s;pecially among the Nobles, who are ve|ry
<PB N="70" REF="50">
curious of it, which is much the better, be|cau&s;e they do not accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the u&s;e of Hats: In &s;hort, it is very &s;urprizing, that however hot the day is, which occa&s;ions the Nights to &s;eem the colder, and more dangerous all over <HI>Italy,</HI> yet at <HI>Venise</HI> they undre&s;s to their Shirts, &s;o pa&s;s the Evening uncovered in their Gondola's, or in walking by the Canals, with|out perceiving the lea&s;t of inconveniencies.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of &s;uch who find them&s;elves, convinc'd by experience, and who are loath to admit the Air to be naturally good in &s;uch a &s;i|tuation, attribute the cau&s;e of this healthfulne&s;s to the great number of Fires, that mu&s;t continu|ally be in &s;o compact and populous a City: for my own part I do not deny, but that the great number of Fires may for a time re&s;i&s;t the bad Ef|fects of an ill Air; but I am per&s;waded, be&s;ides the accu&s;tomed moderation of their Hearths at <HI>Venice,</HI> that it is &s;carcely to be believed that the ordinary Fires of a Town can have &s;o much in-influence as to alter the nature of the Air, and render it healthful in all times of the year.</P>
<P>It may be believed with more probability that the continual &s;alt Vapours of the Sea, with which this Air mu&s;t abound; pre&s;erves it in one con&s;tant quality, and more ea&s;ily hinders tho&s;e various inonveniencies, as being le&s;s &s;ubject to re|ceive the thick exhalations of the Earth, which are undoubtedly of a more &s;uffocating nature, con|&s;i&s;ting of corro&s;ive Salts that abound in mo&s;t Grounds, which have a greater force and di&s;po|&s;ition to corrupt the goodne&s;s of the Air, than
<PB N="71" REF="50">
the &s;tronge&s;t influences of the mo&s;t malevolent Planets; &s;o allowing that the nature of the place renders the Air of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;ubject to frequent alte|rations, yet neverthele&s;s it pre&s;erves it &s;elf with|out altering the quality.</P>
<P>However, to &s;peak truth, the Climate is not very agreeable in Winter, for as this City is eve|ry where open, &s;o it is con&s;equently expo&s;ed to all Winds; this &s;ea&s;on is &s;o cold and trouble|&s;ome here, that I may &s;ay, as it is hotter here than it is at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;o one feels a more &s;harper cold, but indeed it is not of &s;uch long continu|ance; to which may be replied, that it is not &s;o ea&s;y to keep off the Cold here, as it is in ma|ny other places, for what&s;oever Care one u&s;es in clo&s;ing the Curtains of the Gondola, yet they can never be &s;o clo&s;e as the well fix'd Gla&s;&s;es of a Coach.</P>
<P>Yet the plea&s;ure of <HI>Venice</HI> in the Summer does amply recompence the inconveniencies of the Winter; for during the greate&s;t Heats you are no &s;ooner in your Gondola, but you are &s;ure to enjoy upon the Canals, even at Noon-day, a mo&s;t agreeable refre&s;hing Air: but it is mo&s;t commonly Two Hours before Sun &s;et, that one begins to be &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e delightful Breezes that are yet infinitely more plea&s;ant in the Even|ing, at which time you enjoy the plea&s;ure of the Water without di&s;turbance, frequently meet|ing extraordinary good Voices, and upon the great Canal extraordinary fine Concerts of Mu|&s;ick, which the Gallants of the City have in Boats to Serenade the Ladies and Nuns who are much plea&s;ed with the&s;e Diver&s;ions.</P>

<P>There are two rea&s;ons of admiration in the Ebbe and Flood of the <HI>Lagunes</HI> at <HI>Venice.</HI> The fir&s;t is becau&s;e we have not thorougly penetrated into the general cau&s;es of the Sea's ri&s;ing and
<PB N="73" REF="51">
falling; the &s;econd is, &s;eeing there is &s;carce any appearance of either Ebbe or Flood in the whole <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulph, yet that of the <HI>Lagunes</HI> at <HI>Venice</HI> is very great, as likewi&s;e regulated to certain times.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not amu&s;e my &s;elf and the Reader by reporting the many extravagant opinions of &s;e|veral Authours, in relation to the general cau&s;es of &s;o extraordinary a matter. Some do only entertain the curio&s;ity of their Readers with Fables, and others with &s;uch improbable and ab|&s;tru&s;e rea&s;ons, as merit no con&s;ideration here. Among the Philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent Age, <HI>Galileas</HI> hath very ingeniou&s;ly attributed it to the motion of the Earth, making it appear as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence to the rea&s;ons he alledges for it.</P>
<P>Not to detain my &s;elf upon a matter that may be difficult to render apparent, I &s;hall think it &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here that the Ebbe and Flood does an&s;wer exactly to the motion of the Moon, falling every day, like her, 50 Minutes later than the preceding; the Tides being higher in the new and full Moons, than in either of the other quarters, as al&s;o the &s;ame difference between the Equinoctial and Sol&s;tice; it is much to be &s;uppos'd that the Body and motion of the Moon are the real cau&s;es of the Ebbe and Flood, as likewi&s;e tho&s;e many various accidents that attend them.</P>
<P>As the Opinion of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> is &s;a|tisfactory with all the probability that can be de&s;ir'd, in reference to this Wonder that hath for &s;o many Ages kept the World in Su&s;pence;

&s;o it is rea&s;onable we &s;hould admit it for the be&s;t, at lea&s;t until Rea&s;on or Experience &s;hall make tho&s;e Di&s;coveries that may afford our Judgments more Natural and Sen&s;ible Argu|ments of the contrary: So allowing this to be the general Cau&s;e of the Ebbes and Floods, one may in Cour&s;e come to the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e in the <HI>Lagunes</HI> at <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that the Cau&s;e which pro|duceth the Flux and Reflux of the Ocean, &s;hould have tho&s;e Effects in that va&s;t Ma&s;&s;e of Water without making any Impre&s;&s;ion upon tho&s;e of the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> but the rea&s;on why it is not &s;o very apparent, mu&s;t be attri|buted to the manner of the Tides flowing in the Ocean, which is throughout that Sea be|tween the <HI>Tropicks</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> from the <HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North:</HI> Whereas the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> lying con&s;iderably on this &s;ide the <HI>Tropick,</HI> and only a &s;ort of a great Canal from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and very &s;mall of breadth in compari&s;on to the Ocean; &s;o it is not to be imagin'd that the Flux and Reflux can be very &s;en&s;ible there, as well becau&s;e this Sea is very narrow in breadth from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> as likewi&s;e by rea&s;on of the di&s;tant &s;ituation from the <HI>Line</HI> and <HI>Tropicks</HI> in which places the Flux hath the mo&s;t con&s;iderable effects.</P>
<P>From hence it comes that the Tides make but a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> which not being able to move the Waters, cau&s;eth in them only Currents in many places; as may be ob&s;erv'd in the Sea of <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Phare of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> and &s;everal other I&s;lands of
<PB N="75" REF="53">
the <HI>Archipelago:</HI> But as the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea is a Gulph of the <HI>Meditarrenean,</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>Nor|thern</HI> part of it, &s;o con&s;equently the impre&s;&s;ion it &s;uffers being neither interrupted or &s;topt by &s;uch Coa&s;ts at the mouth of the Gulph, that hin|ders its flowing in mo&s;t other places, &s;o it mu&s;t indubitably occa&s;ion the Waters to fall in here, keeping their cour&s;e along the Coa&s;ts to the very utmo&s;t end of the Gulf, where being &s;topt, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e until they have attain|ed a moderate height.</P>
<P>This is exactly what is ob&s;erv'd in this Sea, for upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Calabria</HI> and the King|dom of <HI>Naples</HI> you can only remark a &s;etting of the Water without any manner of Elevati|on; but in the middle of the Gulph and at <HI>Ancona</HI> the Flood begins to be vi&s;ibly apparent, which becomes infinitely more &s;en&s;ible at <HI>Rimini, Ravenna,</HI> upon the <HI>Lido</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> and at <HI>Aqui|lea,</HI> which lies directly in the very bottom of the Gulph.</P>
<P>The Flux of the Ocean is greater as it is di|&s;tant from the places where it begins, which is between the Two <HI>Tropicks,</HI> con&s;equently cau&s;ing the Tides to be much higher upon the <HI>Northern</HI> than upon the <HI>Southern</HI> Coa&s;ts; &s;o the Tide of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulph, making only a &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion in the beginning, by degrees ap|pears at the lower end of the Sea a very con&s;i|derable Tide, and the more by rea&s;on this mo|tion ever gains new force by its continuation.</P>
<P>So I am at pre&s;ent to give my rea&s;on for the Tides being much higher in the <HI>Lagunes</HI> and Canals of <HI>Venice,</HI> than they are even in the
<PB N="76" REF="54">
Gulph it &s;elf. I attribute it to the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the Place, which I have already de&s;crib'd in the beginning of this part, &s;hew|ing them to be Plains that the Sea overflow'd when &s;he made tho&s;e Breaches in that Neck of Land which formerly denied her entrance: For that little the Flood is in the Sea, is by the&s;e natural Dikes which &s;u&s;tain the violencies, and afterward permitting an open pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> mightily increas'd; e&s;pecially after having pa&s;s'd tho&s;e Channels formerly mention'd, it comes to be of &s;o much con&s;ideration, by many rea&s;ons more palpable than tho&s;e I have alledg'd, that what is not but little con&s;iderable in the Sea, occa&s;ions of cour&s;e a very con&s;iderable Flood in the <HI>La|gunes.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort there is Six hours Tide of Flood, which being &s;topt by the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Terra firma,</HI> it then commonly ri&s;es to the height of Four foot in the Canals of <HI>Venice;</HI> &s;o takes its Cour&s;e to the Sea through the Waters, being fallen by the Ebbe of the Gulph which affords it the requi&s;ite means of returning in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, and through the &s;ame places that the Flood brought it into the <HI>Lagunes.</HI></P>
<P>One may in a Calm Sea&s;on at the Mouth of the <HI>Lido</HI> ob&s;erve with much plea&s;ure the making of the Tide; you &s;ee of a &s;udden, and from time to time behold certain great Waves that mount them&s;elves above the &s;mooth &s;urface of the Water, which after having for &s;ome time held a murmuring and impetuous Cour&s;e, do at length loo&s;e them&s;elves in the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> at con|&s;iderabe di&s;tance from the place where they fir&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="54">
appear'd. In this manner the Water is rais'd by the Flood, and the <HI>Lagunes</HI> Swell'd like a great Sea, who&s;e I&s;lands in the middle &s;eem to be as many Sands and half drown'd Cities.</P>
<P>At, or about half Ebbe, you begln to &s;ee the <HI>Lagunes</HI> lie uncover'd of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, which then &s;eem to be about the City &s;o many fine Meadows, cro&s;s which the Tide hath made &s;everal Canals for the di&s;charge of the Waters, which are at all times deep enough for the greate&s;t Barque; to which purpo&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them are, as hath been ob&s;erved, &s;et out with Piles by which they keep on their Way when the <HI>Lagunes</HI> are cover'd, without any danger of running a|ground.</P>
<P>It is nothing le&s;s particular than agreeable to behold the Canals of this City that &s;eem to be &s;o many Rivers, change the Cour&s;e of their Stream every Six hours; which is more remark|able in the great Canals, but e&s;pecially in &s;uch as are long, &s;traight, and who&s;e extremities lie to the Sea; they receive the Water directly without any circulation, which mu&s;t always dimini&s;h &s;omething of that Force, attending the motions of the Ebbe and Flood of the&s;e Tides.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable at <HI>Venice</HI> that the Canals after the Winter Sol&s;tice, and e&s;pcially in <HI>February</HI> are drain'd &s;o very low, that they are frequently not able to make u&s;e of their Gondola's for &s;e|veral Hours, between the times of Ebbe and Flood, excepting the great Canal, which by rea&s;on of the great Currant there, both in the ebbing and flowing of the Tides, does always pre&s;erve a &s;ufficient depth, without being ever
<PB N="80" REF="55">
clean&s;ed, which they are frequently oblig'd to do with extraordinary charges in the other Ca|nals of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the blowing of the Syroc which is the <HI>South-ea&s;t</HI> Wind, the Tide flows &s;o high as to cover with Water all the Keys of the City; the quarter from whence this Wind comes, does di|rectly an&s;wer the Situation of the Gulph, and &s;o mightily augments the &s;trength of the Tide, that the Sea did once overflow all the Streets and Places, and fill'd with &s;alt Water all the Wells of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

<HI>Britany,</HI> by rea&s;on they were called <HI>Veneti</HI> in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Commentaries; others will have it that they were Originally only Fi&s;hers: As if the be&s;t Provinces of <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;uch as tho&s;e are in the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> could probably want Inhabi|tants; and that the Advantagious Situation of the&s;e <HI>I&s;lands</HI> was not likely to draw to them &s;ome con&s;iderable Per&s;ons, as well as &s;o many Poor Eugitives in that Calamitous time, which furni&s;h'd this Countrey with Inhabitants.

<P>After the Emperour <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great had remov'd the Seat of the Empire to <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple, Italy</HI> was afflicted with a long continuance of mis-fortunes, and frequently harra&s;s'd with the Inva&s;ions of the <HI>Barbarians.</HI> In the Year 407, the <HI>Goths</HI> under their King <HI>Radagai&s;ius,</HI> o|ver-run <HI>Italy,</HI> putting all to Fire and Sword. The Neighbouring People to the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> found their &s;afe&s;t Protection in tho&s;e <HI>Maritime I&s;lands,</HI> in the mo&s;t part of which <HI>I&s;les</HI> were only a few Fi&s;her's Cottages. But after the Army com|manded by two Generals of the Emperour <HI>Honorius,</HI> had defeated their enemy <HI>Radagai&s;ius,</HI> the&s;e Refugees return to their habitations upon <HI>Terra firma,</HI> as not having made any con&s;ide|rable E&s;tabli&s;hment in the little time they re|mained in tho&s;e I&s;lands of the <HI>Lagunes.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 413, the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>We&s;t|goths</HI> under <HI>Alaric,</HI> and the horrible ravages they
<PB N="5" REF="57">
committed all over <HI>Italy,</HI> made the&s;e People be|take them&s;elves to the Sanctuary that Pro|tected them Six Years before; in&s;omuch the&s;e I&s;lands of the <HI>Lagunes</HI> was this Second time the Ark that &s;aved them from the Inundation of tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians.</HI> But <HI>Alarick</HI> remaining longer in <HI>Italy</HI> than <HI>Radagai&s;ius,</HI> the&s;e People begun to build Hou&s;es of Wood and Reed in order to Ac|commodate them&s;elves with &s;ome &s;ort of con|veniencies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Paduans</HI> who were Lords of the&s;e I&s;lands of the <HI>Lagunes</HI> had a Port at that of <HI>Rialto,</HI> where their River then Terminated. They re&s;olv'd upon making this a con&s;iderable place, not only as an A&s;ylum, but likewi&s;e to Pro|tect their Commerce at Sea; To which purpo&s;e in the Year 421. The Senate of <HI>Padua</HI> &s;ent thi|ther three Con&s;uls and declar'd <HI>Rialto</HI> a place of Refuge to all &s;orts of People; which occa&s;ioned it to be Peopled in a very little time, as well by Per&s;ons of all conditions that retired thither from the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> as by tho&s;e that were di&s;|pers'd in the other &s;everal I&s;lands of the <HI>La|gunes.</HI></P>
<P>The third Irruption of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> under <HI>Attila</HI> King of the <HI>Huns,</HI> reduced <HI>Italy</HI> to a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition. This &s;courge of the Almighty having ravag'd <HI>Germany, Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> return'd again hither in the Year 453. adding to the De&s;truction of <HI>Pavia, Milan, Pa|dua,</HI> and &s;everal other great Towns, the Fa|mous City of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> which after a &s;iege of three Years was at length con&s;train'd to fall under the mercyle&s;s hand of this cruel Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="58">
The mi&s;erable remainders of &s;o many Cities, compleated the inhabiting with all &s;orts of People not only the I&s;lands of <HI>Rialto,</HI> but like|wi&s;e all tho&s;e in the <HI>Lagunes</HI> and near the &s;ides of the Sea, particularly the <HI>Lido</HI> of <HI>Malamoco;</HI> there being no hopes left to the&s;e People of re|turning to their former habitations, they now begun to lay the foundations of what were to be their future abodes, fetching away the &s;tones and Marble of the Demoli&s;hed Palaces upon <HI>Terra firma;</HI> to build them&s;elves others more &s;afe in the&s;e I&s;lands; &s;o in about Fifty Years time both the People of Quality and tho&s;e of the lower Ranks were conveniently accommodated accord|ing to their Re&s;pective Conditions.</P>
<P><HI>Padua</HI> having in the mean time E&s;tabli&s;hed her &s;elf, and that the Senat perceiving the <HI>Rialto</HI> to become con&s;iderable through the Multitude of Inhabitants, &s;end down <HI>Tribunes</HI> to govern the&s;e People with more dignity: Yet in &s;ome Hi&s;to|ries of the&s;e beginnings, it is ob&s;erved, that &s;uch who were mo&s;t Powerful and Rich in the&s;e I&s;lands, were in proce&s;s of time acknowledg'd as Protectors of the People, by Rea&s;on of the occa|&s;ion they had for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance: in this man|ner each I&s;land had their particular <HI>Tribunes,</HI> who continuing to increa&s;e their Authority either by Force or the Voluntary Submi&s;&s;ions of the People, they came in time to be the little Potentates of the&s;e very mutinous Bodies.</P>
<P>There are yet to be &s;een near the <HI>Rialto</HI> &s;ome Fragments belonging to the ancient Family of the <HI>Badouaire's,</HI> which is yet in being at <HI>Venice,</HI> who from tho&s;e times unto the Election of the
<PB N="7" REF="58">
fir&s;t Doge, that is to &s;ay, for 300 Years, con|tinued them&s;elves Succe&s;&s;ive <HI>Tribunes</HI> at the <HI>Rialto.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 709 the <HI>Tribunes</HI> of the twelve Principal I&s;lands of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> Judging it Ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter into a better Method of governing the&s;e I&s;lands that were &s;o Extreamly Populous, thought fit to compo&s;e a Republick and choo&s;e one among&s;t them for chief: But as they per|ceiv'd they could not proceed in this manner, without prejudicing the Rights the City of <HI>Pa|dua</HI> had in the&s;e places to which they had re|&s;orted for &s;afety, &s;o they &s;ent Deputy's to the Emperour who was Sovereign Lord of the Coun|trey, as likewi&s;e to Pope <HI>John</HI> the fifth, to obtain Permi&s;&s;ion of choo&s;ing a Prince, to whom they gave the Name of <HI>Duke</HI> or Doge.</P>
<P>This Circum&s;tance is ob&s;erved by their own <HI>Hi&s;torians,</HI> who have it, that after the <HI>Tribunes</HI> had obtain'd this grant, they met in <HI>Heraclea</HI> a City of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> of which there remains only &s;ome Ruines near the place where the Ri|ver <HI>Piave</HI> di&s;charges it &s;elf into the <HI>Lagunes;</HI> there they Elected Paul <HI>Lucio Anafe&s;te</HI> for their fir&s;t Doge, in the Year 709 being two hundred eighty eight years after the proclaiming of the <HI>Rialto</HI> by the <HI>Paduans</HI> for a City of Refuge&punc; Yet although it &s;eems that the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;hould denie her beginning from the day of this Election, The <HI>Venetians</HI> do neverthele&s;s compute it from the Proclamation made at the <HI>Rialto</HI> the 25th of <HI>March</HI> in the Year four hundred twenty and one, as we have already ob&s;erved; and accord|ingly upon that day do Solemnize the Nativity of the Republick, pretending their's hath three &s;in|gular advantages over all other State, being
<PB N="8" REF="59">
founded in Freedom, with the Benefit of Chri&s;ti|anity, and at the &s;ame time with that of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Until this very time there was no Mention made of <HI>Venice,</HI> for as then there was no City of that Name; <HI>Heraclea</HI> was the fir&s;t Seat of the Republick, and &s;o continued until the Death of the third Doge, whom the People murthered for his cruelty, re&s;olving to have no more Princes, who&s;e ab&s;olute powers ea&s;ily degenerated into <HI>Tyranny;</HI> This occa&s;ioned an <HI>Interregnum</HI> of Five Years, during which the Republick was go|verned by the Elde&s;t Knights annually Elected.</P>
<P>But the People growing weary of this &s;ort of Government, de&s;ire for the future a Doge; who was Elected at the <HI>Lido</HI> of the old <HI>Malamoco,</HI> be|ing half a League farther into the Sea than the pre|&s;ent <HI>Malamoco,</HI> which former was totally &s;wal|lowed up without leaving the lea&s;t Appearances where it had been. The Doges continued to re&s;ide at <HI>Malamoco</HI> until <HI>Obelerio</HI> the eleventh Prince of this Republick found him&s;elf oblig'd to abandon the Dogal Dignity, retiring to <HI>Pepin</HI> then E&s;tabli&s;hed King of <HI>Lombardy</HI> by his Father <HI>Charles</HI> the great, who had de&s;troyed the King|dom of the <HI>Lombards.</HI></P>
<P>You find in the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> that <HI>Pepin</HI> was the Sovereign of all the&s;e provinces, in which quality the Republick payed him an Annual Tribute; who then re&s;olving to vi&s;it the <HI>Mari|time I&s;lands</HI> within the Jurisdiction of his <HI>De|me&s;ne,</HI> but being refus'd entrance by the Doge Elected in the Room of <HI>Obelerio,</HI> by rea|&s;on of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions he had of the Kings being In&s;tigated, by the Coun&s;el of <HI>Obelerio</HI> to di&s;turb the quiet of the Republick.
<PB N="9" REF="59">
<HI>Pepin</HI> irritated upon the refu&s;al, took Arms again&s;t the&s;e People, ruin'd <HI>Heraclea,</HI> and went on the other &s;ide to Attack <HI>Malamoco,</HI> then the Capital I&s;land; But finding it abandon'd by the Doge and all the Inhabitants who had &s;aved them&s;elves at the <HI>Rialto,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to go through with what he had begun, which was to <HI>Attack</HI> them by Sea.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Annals add, That <HI>Pepin</HI> having embarqu'd his Forces upon Floats, to tran&s;port them by Night to the <HI>Rialto,</HI> there ro&s;e &s;o great a Tempe&s;t, that it broke his Floats, and drown'd mo&s;t part of his Soldiers; which bad &s;ucce&s;s &s;o alter'd the Courage of the King, that he re&s;olv'd to leave tho&s;e people in quiet<HI>:</HI> but de&s;iring to &s;ee the <HI>Rialto,</HI> was receiv'd there with &s;uch De|mon&s;trations of Joy, and &s;o many Marks of Honour, that in a pure Sentiment of Affection for tho&s;e People, he threw his Scepter into the Sea, with this Imprecation, <HI>Thus may they peri&s;h who attempt the Peace of this Republick.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the following matter of the&s;e Annals, and the Te&s;timony of &s;everal Creditable Authors, do plainly prove that <HI>Pepin</HI> was re|ceived at the <HI>Rialto,</HI> rather as a generous Conque|rour, than a Prince ill treated by bad fortune, to whom the Republick would not have con&s;ented after the lo&s;s of his Army, what they had ob&s;ti|nately refu&s;ed when he was in a condition of getting it by force: In &s;hort, the King Exercis'd all Acts of Sovereignty, leaving &s;everal marks of liberality to the Doge and Publick, as like|wi&s;e di&s;charging the Republick of the Tribute they annually payed him, and pre&s;ented them
<PB N="10" REF="60">
with five Miles of extent on <HI>Terra firma</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> with ample liberty of Trafficking both by Sea and by Land.</P>
<P>It is moreover &s;aid that <HI>Pepin</HI> ob&s;erving the Doge to wear no External mark of dignity, took off one of the Sleeves of his Ve&s;t, and put it upon the Doge's Head in the form of a Bonnet; from whence comes the Original of the <HI>Ducal Horn,</HI> &s;o Named from the pointed end of this Sleeve upon his head; It was then that <HI>Venice</HI> received the fir&s;t time, this appellation, for <HI>Pe|pin</HI> would have the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Rialto,</HI> with the other Neighbouring <HI>I&s;lands,</HI> to bear the Name of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> which was then that of the whole Neigh|bouring province to the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> and that the <HI>Rialto</HI> &s;hould be from thence forwards the re&s;i|dence of the Doges and Senate of the Repub|lick.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the beginnings and fir&s;t Pro|gre&s;&s;es of the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> who acknow|ledgeth her Principal E&s;tabli&s;hment and fir&s;t Grandeur, to be owing to the magnanimity and generous Conduct of a <HI>French</HI> King.</P>

of the Year 421, they were the <HI>Cou&s;uls</HI> of <HI>Padua</HI> who Govern'd this State: The Power of the <HI>Tri|bunes</HI> continued without Interruption near upon 300 Years: The Doges Reign'd after them with an ab&s;olute Power for &s;everal Ages: Yet before the Government arrived to that Degree of Per|fection in Policy they now have, there happen'd under the Doges &s;everal con&s;iderable changes, which I &s;hall ob&s;erve in this Relation.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t Election made in the Year 709, at <HI>Heraclea</HI> of <HI>Paul Lucio Anafe&s;te,</HI> until that of <HI>Seba&s;tian Ziani,</HI> the Doges reign'd with an ab&s;o|lute Authority, the People electing him by their Acclamations whom they Judg'd mo&s;t worthy of the Dogal dignity, who Acted as Monarch, for he was Ma&s;ter of his own Council, nor ac|countable to any body for his Admini&s;tration; in &s;hort, he had a de&s;potick Power both in Peace and War: The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Venice</HI> gives us the Examples of &s;everal Doges that made their Bro|thers, or their Children, to be elected for their Collegues and Succe&s;&s;ours.</P>

the right they had of choo&s;ing the Doge; as likewi&s;e at the &s;ame time to moderate the great Authority of the Prince, they e&s;tabli&s;hed an In|dependant Council, from which &s;hould be drawn by Election the Electors of the Doge.</P>
<P>An alteration of this con&s;equence that e&s;ta|bli&s;hed an intire new method of Government, would without di&s;pute have caus'd a Revolution in the State, but they found an expedient that pleas'd the People, which was to allow them in exchange the liberty of Nominating Twelve <HI>Tribunes,</HI> who &s;hould have Power of oppo&s;ing the Ordinances of the Prince, which &s;hould be of no validity if they were not approv'd by them; re|&s;olving in this to follow the Example of the An|cient Government of <HI>Rome.</HI> Their <HI>Tribunes,</HI> who were two in each of the Six Wards of the City, had moreover a right of choo&s;ing every Year upon the Fea&s;t of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> Forty &s;uch Per|&s;ons as they judg'd proper in each Ward or Quarter, to Compo&s;e the great Council they then e&s;tabli&s;h'd, con&s;i&s;ting of Two Hundred and Forty Citizens impartially cho&s;en, and without di&s;tinction in all the different E&s;tates, to wit, the <HI>Nobility, Citizens</HI> and <HI>Trade&s;men;</HI> as this Council was to be renewed every Year, &s;o every one was to be of it in his turn, or at lea&s;t had the right of pretending to it.</P>
<P>This method of Government continued a Hundred and Seventeen Years unto the Year 1289; At which time the Doge <HI>Peter Gradenigue,</HI> took upon him the intire alteration of the form of this Republick, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a perfect <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> in fixing the great Council for ever

to a certain Number and their De&s;cendants, who taking upon them&s;elves for the future the whole Cognizance of all matters of State, were to have the Sovereign Admini&s;tration exclu&s;ive to all the other Families.</P>

<P>However, unju&s;t and unequal this proceeding &s;eems to be in regard of &s;everal con&s;iderable Families, yet the Republick owes to it the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the perfecte&s;t Government that e|ver was, and which happily continues to this very time: It is Neverthele&s;s to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch a change was not made without occa|&s;ioning great troubles in the Republick; but they were &s;oon qua&s;h'd by puni&s;hing of the Weak, and Satisfying of the more Powerful, with &s;uch Privileges as exempted them from the Number of the excluded.</P>

Several Noble Families that did not then fore|&s;ee the mighty con&s;equence of this exclu&s;ion, yet irritated to &s;ee &s;uch preferr'd before them as were their Inferiors, did however detain them|&s;elves from di&s;covering their Re&s;entments, as po&s;&s;ibly not thinking that by this E&s;tabli&s;hment, which is called, <HI>Il &s;errar del Con&s;iglio,</HI> the Fami|lies which Compos'd it &s;hould mount to tho&s;e high Degrees of Preferment as for ever to re|main Ma&s;ters, and they the Subjects to be ab&s;olute|ly govern'd by them for the future, who were only to have for their &s;hare a pa&s;&s;ive and blind obedience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the Antiquity of the</HI> Venetian <HI>Nobility.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentry pretend them&s;elves to be of a more ancient de&s;cent, than any o|ther Nobility in <HI>Europe;</HI> Some of the&s;e Nobles that were never beyond their <HI>Lagunes,</HI> do ima|gine there is no difference between a Noble <HI>Ve|netian</HI> and a Sovereign Prince: But not to en|gage my &s;elf with the&s;e Ridiculous fancies, I ought to &s;ay before I enter into the Particulars of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility, that it is true accord|ing to the &s;entiments of the mo&s;t experienc'd <HI>Genealogi&s;ts,</HI> that it is very difficult, not to &s;ay im|po&s;&s;ible, for particular families to produce Au|thentick Acts of their Nobility for above Six Hundred Years, e&s;pecially to prove exactly a higher line of de&s;cendance.</P>
<P>Whether this difficulty proceeds from the lit|tle care of tho&s;e who preceeded us, or that the great Revolutions to which all States are liable, by confounding the order of things, may not have been the occa&s;ion of it, or la&s;tly, that our Families not being di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Names, a|bove tho&s;e times, are the real cau&s;e of di&s;abling us from penetrating into the ob&s;curity it hath brought into this part of <HI>Hi&s;tory.</HI> I do mantain that none of the&s;e Rea&s;ons are valid, in regard of
<PB N="16" REF="63">
the ancient Families of <HI>Venice;</HI> there being tho&s;e that have indubitable proofs of an Antiquity not only equal, but likewi&s;e which are before the time of the fir&s;t Foundation of this Republick.</P>
<P>The truth of this will admit of no Objection, if we ob&s;erve that the <HI>Faliers</HI> and <HI>Candians</HI> with &s;everal other Noble <HI>Paduans</HI> that were &s;ent by the Senat as the fir&s;t Con&s;uls to the <HI>Rialto;</HI> and that the <HI>Tribunes</HI> who govern'd afterwards the&s;e I&s;lands for three Centurys together, were Per|&s;ons of quality Powerful both in Effects and Cre|dit, as the <HI>Badouaire's</HI> at the <HI>Rialto;</HI> &s;o if the Families that bear the&s;e Names at pre&s;ent in <HI>Venice,</HI> are really de&s;cended from tho&s;e who were formerly there di&s;tingui&s;h'd by them; it mu&s;t be granted that the antiquity of this Nobility, goes much beyond tho&s;e Limits the <HI>Genealogi&s;ts</HI> pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The proofs that may be deduc'd for the con|tinuation of the&s;e Families without any Inter|ruption, appear &s;o much more Authentick, as they are E&s;tabli&s;h'd upon &s;uch acts that are no ways liable to any manner of Fal&s;ification<HI>:</HI> They being taken partly from the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Venice,</HI> which is the le&s;s to be Su&s;pected of Corruption in regard to the Antiquity of the Nobility, by Rea&s;on the <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI> had no de&s;ign in promoting it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e proofs is, that there never happen'd at <HI>Venice</HI> any of tho&s;e Revolutions that by Wars, Seiges and Burnings de&s;troyed the Me|mory of things, or that at lea&s;t have troubled the order and confounded the knowledge of matters; neither hath there been tho&s;e &s;orts of Interruptions and Suppo&s;itions, which have in
<PB N="17" REF="63">
other Countries in&s;en&s;ibly disjointed the de&s;cents of Families which even hinder us at pre&s;ent from attaining the True Knowledge of them.</P>
<P>The Second and &s;tronge&s;t of all the proofs to be alledg'd, is taken from the &s;ame Hi&s;tory, where we find the Names of the <HI>Noble Veneti|ans</HI> to be always certain, as never a&s;&s;uming the Names of either <HI>Titles</HI> or <HI>Dignities,</HI> which they u&s;ually do in <HI>France.</HI> The &s;ame Cu&s;tom is yet inviolably ob&s;erved at <HI>Venice,</HI> and as one of the Fundamental Laws of the State. So their <HI>Pro|per Names</HI> have remain'd the &s;ame at all times, of which may be made &s;everal In&s;tances beyond all manner of Contradiction.</P>
<P>The Family of the <HI>Badouaires</HI> having given Tribunes to the I&s;le of <HI>Rialto,</HI> for Three Hundred Years together, as hath been already &s;aid, the la&s;t of tho&s;e Tribunes was one of the Twelve Electors of the fir&s;t Doge; and the fir&s;t Doge Elected at <HI>Venice,</HI> was one of that Family, who afterwards continued Doges from Father to Son for &s;ix or &s;even De&s;cents, in&s;omuch that they mi&s;s'd but little of continuing that Dignity down to their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Since which time we may &s;ee for Eight Hun|dred Years, &s;everal long De&s;cendancys in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Venice,</HI> where the Sons are never o|therwi&s;e called than by the Names of their Fa|thers.</P>
<P>I might alledg for the la&s;t In&s;tance, as not be|ing of &s;mall Importance, to prove the Verity of this A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That their Ancient Hou&s;es ha|ving been always within the City of</HI> Venice, <HI>&s;o they have in all times been acknowledg'd for what they</HI>

<P><HI>Nicolas Sagredo</HI> who &s;ucceeded him is the fir&s;t Doge of this Family, which is of the Second cla&s;s or order of Nobility; he was made for his great Merits Procurator of Saint <HI>Mark,</HI> having been a great while in the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable Employs of the Republick, and actually had the greate&s;t &s;hare in the Government of the State: In&s;omuch that his Elevation mu&s;t be rather a&s;crib'd to his own perticular Merits than to the Factions of his Friends. Notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everity of the Conditions that at|tend the Dogal Dignity, yet there were never &s;o many known to &s;tand for it as upon this E|lection, or &s;o many Per&s;ons capable to di&s;|charge the Duties of this great Place.</P>
<P>This Dignity is no ways le&s;s burthen&s;ome to the Family than it is to the Per&s;on of the Doge; for his Brothers, Sons and Grand&s;ons can have no con&s;iderable Employs in the Republick, which have any Affinity with the Government; if they have any or chance to be Emba&s;&s;adours, they are oblig'd to quit tho&s;e Affairs upon his Election. If the Doge is a Married Man, his Wife is not Treated with the Title of <HI>Prince&s;&s;e,</HI> neither hath the <HI>Senate</HI> thought fit to Crown them this la&s;t Age, as being de&s;irous either to Moderate the Ambition of the Women, or to &s;ave tho&s;e great Sums that were expended upon the Coronation of the la&s;t Prince&s;s, Wife to the Doge <HI>Martin Crimani.</HI></P>
<P>The particular re&s;traint that is laid upon the per&s;ons of the Doges, as likewi&s;e their ways of li|ving,
<PB N="68" REF="89">
and all the&s;e other Circum&s;tances of that condition together, are not &s;ufficient to deter &s;uch Families as have given no Doges to the Republick from making their utmo&s;t Efforts to attain this Honour; by which they do not only hope to bring them&s;elves into a much greater con&s;idera|tion, but likewi&s;e to E&s;tabli&s;h their Fortunes by the Sums they may acquire if the Doge hap|pens to live many Years after his Election; which is one of the Rea&s;ons why the Doge is Created for Life: be&s;ides, if it was for a cer|tain &s;pace of time only, he would not be &s;o much con&s;ider'd in all other Courts, neither would the <HI>Senate</HI> be able to keep him in the great re&s;traint that is now impo&s;ed upon him, through the Fear of being depos'd or of a re|tro&s;pection into his conduct after Death, to the mighty Prejudice of his whole Family.</P>
<P>As the Republick hath &s;ometimes forc'd their Princes to a&s;&s;ume and continue this Dignity, &s;o they have likewi&s;e depos'd others who&s;e Age or Infirmities have rendred them u&s;ele&s;s to the State; yet in reality the <HI>Republick</HI> ma|kes a greater u&s;e of their name than their pre|&s;ence, upon which Apprehen&s;ions the Doge ne|ver de&s;i&s;ts from going to the <HI>Colledge</HI> and all other Courts of Ju&s;tice, to which the Duties of his Station oblige him, unle&s;s he finds him|&s;elf altogether uncapable of doing it; there|fore I do not in the lea&s;t doubt but that <HI>Domi|nico Contarini</HI> did expect &s;ome &s;uch Re&s;olution, upon his long Indi&s;po&s;ition of the Pal&s;y that deprived him for Eighteen Months of the u&s;e of one &s;ide of his Body. For when any Em|ba&s;&s;adour
<PB N="69" REF="89">
&s;ent to compliment him, he always concluded his thanks, with his being much bet|ter; and that he was in hopes to &s;ee the Emba&s;&s;a|dour in a little time at the <HI>College.</HI></P>
<P>The Doge pre&s;ides in all the Councils, but he is e&s;teem'd Prince of the <HI>Republick</HI> only at the head of the <HI>Senate,</HI> at the <HI>Tribunals</HI> where he a&s;&s;i&s;ts, and in the Ducal Palace of Saint <HI>Mark;</HI> out of which places he hath much le&s;s Authority than &s;ome other particular Per&s;ons; for he dares not engage in any bu&s;ine&s;s whate|ver. There are &s;ome who have reported in their writings that it is Lawful to affront or kill him upon finding him out of the City, and that he hath not the Liberty to go out of his Palace, It is true that there hath been for|merly very &s;evere Regulations as to this mat|ter, but things are not carried to that <HI>Exire|mity</HI> at pre&s;ent; however he goes not out of the City without asking in a manner leave of his Councellors: <HI>Dominico Contarini</HI> went fre|quently to &s;ee his Daughters and Nieces that were in &s;everal Nunneries, as likewi&s;e very of|ten every Year to his Country Hou&s;e to enjoy the Air of the Continent.</P>
<P>When the Doge goes out of the City he is not attended with any External Marks that may di&s;tingui&s;h him from any other <HI>Venetian Gentle|man;</HI> his apparel is then a gray clo&s;e Bodied Coat and his &s;word by his &s;ide; if any Noble happens to meet him, he &s;eems not to know him to avoid rendring tho&s;e re&s;pects that are due to him, when he is with the <HI>Republick;</HI> who are the &s;ame thing in his ab&s;ence as when
<PB N="70" REF="90">
he is pre&s;ent; upon any particular Vi&s;its that the <HI>Doge</HI> makes in the City, he is only atten|ded like another Noble, with a <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> and two <HI>Gondalo</HI>'s; neither is that di&s;cernable from another but by a Carpet, and two flow|er'd Sattin Cu&s;hions again&s;t the Back-board, which &s;mall marks of Dignity are &s;o far from being expo&s;ed, that the <HI>Gondaliers</HI> mo&s;t an end cover them all with the black Curtains of the <HI>Gondalo.</HI></P>
<P>His Dre&s;s is, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, like tho&s;e of the Coun&s;ellors, which is Purple, but he wears a General's Cap of the &s;ame Colour, with his Ve&s;t; it is round made of Pa&s;te-board, only four Fingers high, the Crown flat, and the circumference of the whole, double to what the Entrance of the Head is.</P>
<P>They give the <HI>Doge</HI> the Title of your <HI>Scre|nity,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;t Screne Prince;</HI> and that he may be &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e Titles do not belong to his Per&s;on, all Emba&s;&s;adors take care to u&s;e the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions when they &s;peak to the <HI>Col|lege,</HI> &s;eldom &s;aying <HI>your Screnity,</HI> without ad|ding <HI>your Excellency's;</HI> being confus'd Ti|tles; among which no difference ought to be made in this A&s;&s;embly, where the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Republick</HI> is dilated upon all the Members that compo&s;e the <HI>College.</HI></P>
<P>Altho all Di&s;patches are made in the Name of the <HI>Prince,</HI> as likewi&s;e the An&s;wers of Em|ba&s;&s;adors are addre&s;s'd to him, yet he cannot open them, which may be done and an&s;wer'd without him; and that he may continually re|member that he only lends his Name to the <HI>Se|nate,</HI>

<P>The Money of <HI>Venice</HI> bears the Name of the <HI>Doge,</HI> but it is not made with his Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Coin, as it was formerly in the time when the <HI>Doge</HI> had the ab&s;olute Power of the Government, there being now, in&s;tead of his Effigies, a <HI>Doge</HI> in his Ducal Habits upon his Knees to St. <HI>Mark,</HI> to &s;hew that the Prince is the Subject of the <HI>Republick,</HI> of which the Pi|cture of St. <HI>Mark</HI> is the Hieroglyphick: Yet in the Mint where the Money is Coin'd all pri|vate Per&s;ons upon paying the Duties to the Prince, have the Liberty of Coining what Sums they plea&s;e; the <HI>Doge</HI> gives the Permi&s;&s;ion, and enjoys the Advantages proceeding from it.</P>

<P>The <HI>Republick</HI> hath not only inve&s;ted the Prince with all the apparent marks of Sovereign Dignity, but they have al&s;o obtain'd for him from the <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Kings,</HI> the real Preroga|tives of Royal Maje&s;ty, and the preference next to Crown'd Heads of all other Princes in ge|neral: It is to be admired that they &s;hould as it &s;eems, go contrary to the&s;e Advantages of Pre-eminency, by reducing of him to the de|gree of all other Princes, in re&s;pect of the <HI>Car|dinals;</HI> for when a <HI>Cardinal</HI> hath Audience, he &s;its on the Right of the <HI>Doge,</HI> in his own Chair, that is made larger upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions; and upon any particular Vi&s;it, the <HI>Doge</HI> goes to re|ceive him at his <HI>Gondalo.</HI></P>

avoid it: The Count <HI>D' Avaux</HI> was the fir&s;t that undertook to vi&s;it the Doge <HI>Dominico Contarini,</HI> in his Sickne&s;s, to which the <HI>Senate</HI> con&s;ented<HI>:</HI> In this Occa&s;ion the Gentleman of the <HI>Doge,</HI> and &s;ome other Officers, are at the Landing-place of the Palace to conduct the Amba&s;&s;adour to the <HI>Doge:</HI> The <HI>Senate</HI> are &s;ure in the&s;e Junctures to be pun|ctually informed of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Words that pa&s;s in the Di&s;cour&s;e.

<P>The <HI>Doge</HI> can only give general An&s;wers to Emba&s;&s;adors upon the Propo&s;itions they intend to exhibit to the <HI>College;</HI> for if he &s;hould word it &s;o as to bring the <HI>Senate</HI> into the lea&s;t En|gagement; he would not only meet with the Confu&s;ion of having it di&s;own'd, but would likewi&s;e expo&s;e him&s;elf to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Mortifications: However if the Propo&s;itions of an Emba&s;&s;ador are prejudicial to the Dignity of the <HI>Republick,</HI> the <HI>Doge</HI> is not only &s;upported in &s;uch a Juncture, by an&s;wering in the Name of the <HI>Republick,</HI> with all the Rigour of an in|cens'd Prince, but he is moreover oblig'd to act in that Nature, if he would not be e&s;teem'd unworthy of the Place he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.

<PB N="74" REF="92">
the Liberty to an&s;wer more amply, but without ever entring into a particular.</P>
<P>The continual occa&s;ion which the Doge <HI>Do|minico Contarini</HI> had of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf upon the&s;e Matters, had acquir'd him a mighty Faci|lity of making &s;uch adequate Replies, and &s;o proportion'd to the Subject, that no Prince was ever known to exceed him; neverthele&s;s for having made &s;ome that did not &s;eem to be &s;uf|ficiently laid upon general terms, he was forc'd to &s;u&s;tain in the&s;e Occa&s;ions the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Reprimands. It is not in the&s;e Audiences only that the <HI>Doge</HI> is oblig'd to have a care of exceed|ing the limits pre&s;crib'd him, but it likewi&s;e behoves him to proportion the Steps of his Con|duct: The Affair of Mon&s;eignior <HI>Altoviti,</HI> Pre|dece&s;&s;our to Mon&s;eignior <HI>Vare&s;e</HI> Nuncio to the <HI>Pope,</HI> &s;eem'd a thing of no importance in re|gard of the <HI>Doge,</HI> yet it neverthele&s;s made his <HI>Serenity</HI> extreamly &s;en&s;ible of the Mi&s;ery of his Condition.</P>
<P>This <HI>Nuncio</HI> had demanded &s;atisfaction of the <HI>College,</HI> for that contrary to the Privileege of Emba&s;&s;adors, the <HI>Grand Captain,</HI> or <HI>Provost,</HI> had &s;eized one of his Retinue for carrying of Pi&s;tols; the Per&s;on was Releas'd upon their be|ing a&s;&s;ur'd that he belong'd to the <HI>Nuncio;</HI> yet the <HI>Prelate</HI> was not contented with this &s;atisfacti|on, but demanded &s;omething more publick; and &s;eeing the <HI>Senate</HI> was not di&s;pos'd to humour his Niceties, he publickly &s;hew'd his Re&s;entments, by refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Ceremonies of the <HI>Chappels,</HI> which the <HI>Doge</HI> very frequently holds, which is the only means that Emba&s;&s;adors have
<PB N="75" REF="92">
of di&s;covering their Di&s;contents to the People, when they pretend not to have Ju&s;tice done them, as they ought in rea&s;on to expect: And as the <HI>Senate</HI> does u&s;ually receive this proceeding for a Mark of Contempt, and not being wil|ling upon &s;uch frivolous Occa&s;ions to let the People perceive the Mi&s;under&s;tanding, &s;o they become more tractable and ea&s;ier inclin'd to give &s;atisfaction to the Mini&s;ters, who ought to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant with the <HI>Seignory</HI> upon tho&s;e Cere|monies.</P>
<P>The great Fea&s;t of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> was then approach|ing, at which time the <HI>Seignory</HI> goes for &s;eve|ral Days together to the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> both in the Morning and Afternoon, which made the <HI>Senate</HI> unwilling to defer giving &s;atis|faction to the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> that &s;o ob&s;tinately ad|hear'd to his Preten&s;ions: However all the Re|turn was, That the <HI>Grand Captain</HI> who &s;eiz'd the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> was not to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant in attending the <HI>Doge</HI> upon three of tho&s;e Solemn Functi|ons; accordingly he appeared not at the fir&s;t Ceremony of <HI>Tenebres, Holy Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;|day,</HI> but he came upon <HI>Good-Friday</HI> in the Morn|ing to the Court of the <HI>Palace</HI> to march in his place: The <HI>Nuncio</HI> being in the Apartment where they a&s;&s;emble upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, was inform'd of it by &s;uch as were to ob&s;erve in what manner the Satisfaction was made; he complain'd at that very in&s;tant to the <HI>Doge,</HI> that they had contraven'd to the A&s;&s;urances given him, prote&s;ting that he would proceed no far|ther, if that Officer was not ordered to go out of the Palace; in&s;omuch that the Prince believing

<P>The <HI>Senate</HI> however explain'd the Terms of this Satisfaction quite otherwi&s;e to what the <HI>Doge</HI> and <HI>Nuncio</HI> did; for they pretended that three different Functions at the Church of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> were what the <HI>Nuncio</HI> had taken for the officiating of three di&s;tinct Solemn Fea&s;ts; for which rea&s;on they equally re&s;ented the mat|ter again&s;t the <HI>Doge,</HI> and the <HI>Captain,</HI> the one for Commanding, and the latter for having O|beyed contrary to his Duty: The Officer was thrown into a Pri&s;on and &s;everely us'd, to give him the Knowledge of his Superiors<HI>:</HI> And one of the <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> of State, who have as ample a Power of Life and Death over the Prince, as over the lea&s;t Gentleman of the <HI>Republick,</HI> made him &s;o &s;evere a Reprimand in minding of him that his Life was in their Hands, upon com|manding any one to exceed his Duty; that the poor Prince bur&s;t into Tears, regreating with|out doubt the Delights of the private Condition he enjoyed at his Country Seat before the Ele|ction.</P>

<P>There is placed on each &s;ide the Throne of the Seignory, over again&s;t the two la&s;t Coun|cellors, two high and deep Cups, into which they may reach their hands but cannot &s;ee which to choo&s;e; the Secretaries count &s;o many balls as there are Nobles in the A&s;&s;embly, which number is divided into the two Cups, in each whereof there are moreover thirty gilt balls; the others are white. At the feet of the Doge there &s;tands a third Cup, in which there is the &s;ame Number of balls
<PB N="111" REF="114">
as there are Gilt ones in the other two, that is Sixty, of which thirty &s;ix only are Gilt. After this the Nobles being call'd by a Secre|tary according to the Benches they &s;it on, come two and two together to draw each of them a ball, out of the Cup on the &s;ide they are of; if it is white they throw it away, if a gilt one the Gentleman &s;hews it and gives it the Councellor next the Cup, then advancing to the Doge draws one of the &s;ixty balls, if he Pitches upon a gilt one, he is of the Number of Electors, that have the di&s;tribution of the Charge, but if it is white he retires to his place.</P>
<P>After there are Nine Electors made in this manner, they withdraw with a Secretary into a &s;eparated Room from the Council, where after they have drawn Lots for their places, he that is the fir&s;t, Nominates a Noble for the fir&s;t of the Employs that is to be given, the others do the &s;ame according to the places of their Lots; The&s;e Nine Electors do then bal|lot one after another the Nine Nobles elected, he that hath not &s;ix Balls is excluded; and he that is Nominated continues until there is one that hath &s;ix of the Suffrages.</P>
<P>When Nine other Electors are by Lot drawn in the Great Council, they are to proceed in the &s;ame method, by Nominating and Ballot|ing Nine &s;everal Nobles for the &s;ame Nine Employs, which is thus ob&s;erved until the Six and Thirty Electors drawn into four &s;eve|ral Bodys of Nine each, have elected Thirty Six Gentlemen, that is four to each Employ,
<PB N="112" REF="115">
upon which they are Balloted one after ano|ther by the Great Council; he of the four ha|ving mo&s;t Balls, &s;tands provided with the Employ to which he was Named.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h the&s;e Ballotations with the le&s;s lo&s;s of time, there are a great many Chil|dren of the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Foundlings,</HI> who carry in a Bag little Balls of &s;tuff about the bigne&s;s of a Ha&s;il Nut; they have likewi&s;e in their hands a Box, &s;omewhat re&s;embling to that which collects the Suffrages of the <HI>Senate,</HI> ex|cepting in the&s;e there are only two di&s;tinct places, one for the <HI>YEA</HI>'s the other for the <HI>NO</HI>'s, there being no doubtful or indifferent voices in the di&s;tribution of the Employs, as there are for the uncertain ones of the Various Opi|nions upon the affairs of State. The&s;e Chil|dren go up and down the Hall, crying alloud the Name of the Noble balloted. But this way of balloting is manag'd with &s;o much con|fu&s;ion by the Children, that carry the boxes Tumultuou&s;ly to and again, as likewi&s;e with &s;o little dignity by the Nobles who &s;ome times unheedingly drop their Balls in walk|ing unconcernedly about the Hall; in the whole this want of order is highly undecent and altogether oppo&s;ite to the Gravity, that ought to be in&s;eparable to &s;uch an Illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal <HI>Senators</HI> di&s;pers'd about the Hall, to take care that no abu&s;es may be committed in the <HI>Ballotations,</HI> yet it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to be &s;ure that a Noble &s;hall not take two Balls, being the long entrance of the box
<PB N="113" REF="115">
intirely hides the hand, yet it is purpo&s;ely &s;o contrived, to the end they may throw the ball into which &s;ide they plea&s;e, without being di&s;|cerned: therefore to give &s;everal balls to &s;erve a friend, or to injure an Enemy, is forbidden upon the penalty of being for ever excluded the Council, which is the &s;ame thing with being deprived of Nobility, as hath &s;ometimes happened.</P>
<P>In the&s;e <HI>Ballotations</HI> the party's of the Young|men are almo&s;t ever the &s;tronge&s;t, e&s;pecially when the matter in debate is for the mortifi|cation of a <HI>Senator,</HI> either by not continuing him in his Dignity at the end of the year, or by fetching a Noble out of the great Employs of the Seignory, to execute one of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable Offices in the State, as I have al|ready ob&s;erved, for not having regulated his conduct according to their &s;entiments. In the Great Council hatred and Enmity put in Practice all the Artifices of revenge: it is there that Di&s;&s;imulation reigns in the full height, where not being Liable to be detected of fal&s;ehood, they u&s;ually prote&s;t to the Excluded all the good offices of &s;incere Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that the&s;e &s;ecret ways of &s;atisfying their pa&s;&s;ions, are attended with no other effect than that of preventing the No|bility from carrying their re&s;entments higher; yet this advantage is very con&s;iderable to a <HI>Re|publick;</HI> which can apprehend nothing &s;o much as the divi&s;ion of her principal Mem|bers; but the reciprocal dependance in which the Great Council keeps the Nobles, and the
<PB N="114" REF="116">
continual fear of &s;eeing them&s;elves Balloted to the prejudice, of their Intere&s;t and Honours, does not only oblige them to ob&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures of living well with each other, at lea&s;t, apparently in a perfect good under&s;tanding; but the&s;e con&s;iderations do moreover in&s;pire them with a real Zeal and an intire attachement to the good of the Pub|lick, which are the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured meanes for a Nobleman to attain the principal Employs of the <HI>Republick,</HI> as likewi&s;e to acquire the e&s;teem and affection of his equals, if he any ways &s;tudies their good Opinions.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Ballotations</HI> of the great Council are perform'd in a manner before the eyes of the <HI>Publick,</HI> for the doors are not only open, but there is likewi&s;e an elevated bench for &s;uch Strangers who come out of curio&s;ity to &s;ee the&s;e Gentlemen pa&s;s their Suffrages; but as the Nobles that come to the Great Council are permitted to &s;peak their &s;entiments upon the things propo&s;ed by the Councellor for the week (according to the cu&s;tom of the Sage for the week in the <HI>Senate,)</HI> or to give his Opinion upon any other important matter of State; &s;o in the&s;e occa&s;ions all &s;trangers are oblig'd to go out, that they may not enter into the Cogni&s;ance of tho&s;e things that belong to the Nobility only.</P>
<P>There is in the Hall of the Great Coun|cil a &s;ort of a chair which is de&s;ign'd for the u&s;e of &s;uch as harangue in the a&s;&s;embly; it was there that <HI>Marc Attonio Cornaro,</HI> more than a Year after the lo&s;s of <HI>Candia,</HI> made an unex|pected

<P>The Great Council being A&s;&s;embled that day; the Guards at the doors &s;eeing the&s;e peo|ple make to them, &s;topp'd and drove them away by force: but they not under&s;tanding the venetian Language, took this proceeding for a new affront, went back to their Galiot, from whence they return'd with the re&s;t of

<P>This <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> had Credit &s;ufficient, with his Two Collegues, to get his Project ap|prov'd of; for which Rea&s;on, from that very day, all the Nobility were, upon great Penal|ties, forbidden the u&s;e of Perukes, with Or|ders to all &s;uch who had begun to wear them, to forbear the continuance. It is no very difficult matter to imagine what a perplexity this Order occa&s;ion'd to all the Young Nobili|ty, who were then &s;o very curious in their Wiggs, that even &s;uch as had very fine heads of Hair, preferr'd the acquired to their own; &s;paring no Co&s;ts to get tho&s;e that were be&s;t made; but the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of obey|ing

the crime with all the Circum&s;tances that can render it odious; always concluding with the merits of a very vigorous pun|i&s;hment.

Selected to carry Arms; who&s;e chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to be frequently excercis'd and pa&s;s the review; that &s;o Foreigners and neighbouring Princes may believe that the <HI>Republick</HI> is ever &s;tongly provided; The Captains and Serjeants are only payed, as for the Souldiers they are contented with &s;ome Ex|emptions; however upon any &s;udden occa&s;ion this <HI>Militia</HI> might be made very Serviceable to the <HI>Republick,</HI> by joyning them to the Body of their other &s;tanding forces.</P>
<P>Although the <HI>Republick</HI> is of the Opinion that a War is much more chargeable to them than to all other Princes, by rea&s;on they Em|ploy only foreign Troops, yet they rather choo&s;e to be at that charge, as likewi&s;e the uncertainty of being Well Serv'd by them, which is but Seldom; than to train up their own Subjects to di&s;cipline, and render them capable of being feared for the future. There|fore when they are engag'd in a Land War, the <HI>Republick</HI> does not only rai&s;e their Troops out of their Dominions, but they likewi&s;e give the command of them to &s;ome Prince, or Per&s;on of con&s;ideration whom &s;he engages to her Intere&s;t by the large Allowances that are given him. This General hath under him Generals of the Cavalry and infantry; but the two Nobles which the Senate gives him for A&s;&s;i&s;tants, with the Titles of Proveditors General, do in effect only leave him the Name of <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo,</HI> for they are to confirm all Re&s;olutions and order the de&s;igns of the

Campaign; they rarely permit of any Opi|nions that proceed not from them&s;elves, fre|quently obliging the experience of the Principal Officers, to give way to the Jealou&s;ie they have of their own Authority.</P>
<P>The Senate gives their Principal Application to the Marine Affairs; the Genius of the&s;e People is very Inclinable to all Naval at|tempts; they &s;upport the weight of the&s;e Wars with much le&s;s difficulty, than tho&s;e upon Land; this Republick hath rai&s;ed it &s;elf from the Sea, and to her &s;he is indebt|ed for her great increa&s;e; It is through her Maritime forces that &s;he is become for|midable to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and which formerly gained her tho&s;e very large Conque&s;ts. As the <HI>Venetians</HI> are born in the Sea, &s;o they are not le&s;s Skilful upon this Element than they are happy; in&s;omuch that for one Di&s;|advantage received, they may reckon a Hundred Times Succe&s;s; their valour ren|der'd them Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Adriatick Gulf,</HI> and there is no que&s;tion but they will as Vi|gorou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as they Judge the con&s;equences of it to be very Impor|tant.</P>
<P>In times of Peace the Republick does not maintain a certain Regulated Naval force, however they are always able to &s;et out in a very little time five and twenty Gallies; She keeps in the Gulf only a Squadron of Six Gallies, &s;everal <HI>Galiots</HI> and <HI>Brigantins;</HI>

The Pro|veditor General of the Sea commonly re|&s;ides at <HI>Corfu,</HI> his Employ continues two Years, at the end of which he gives the Senate an account of the admini&s;tration of his Office.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Republick</HI> enters into a War by Sea, &s;he does not give the command of her forces to a foreign General, as is practis'd in tho&s;e a-&s;hoar: but in the&s;e important junctures, upon which &s;eems to depend the intire &s;afety of the State, the <HI>Republick</HI> con&s;titutes &s;ome Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> General by Sea, who does not only command the other before mentioned General Officers; but like|wi&s;e all Governours of Maritime Places, to whom he &s;ends his orders according to the various circum&s;tances of the time and War; he moreover di&s;po&s;es and orders without controul all Offices, and Revenues appoint|ed for the &s;upport of the Army. Yet the apprehen&s;ions of an Inquiry, and the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;ity of giving the Senate an exact report of what he had done; makes the General very a&s;&s;iduous in find|ing out plau&s;ible pretences to all the mi&s;|carriages

<HEAD><HI>Of the Revenues and Expence of the</HI> Republick.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be very Tedious to give a long account of the Revenues of the Re|publick, and to make a particular Calcula|tion of what each City and Province amounts to. I &s;hall content my &s;elf with ob&s;erv|ing in General how much the u&s;ual account is, that by the knowledge of the Revenues of the State one may be able to Judge of the greatne&s;s of their &s;trength. I &s;hall at the &s;ame time endeavour to &s;hew what ways and means the Republick hath taken, to oppo&s;e all the attempts of the <HI>Turks</HI> both by Sea and Land; as likewi&s;e to maintain a War for five and twenty years together again&s;t &s;o Powerful an Empire.</P>
<P>It is a difficult matter to know the exact value of the&s;e Revenues, being the Repub|lick is always Augmenting and Dimini&s;hing of them, according to the Nece&s;&s;ities of the
<PB N="162" REF="140">
War and occa&s;ions in Peace. However according to Computation of the Rigi&s;ter of Receipts, before the pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities of the la&s;t War of <HI>Candia,</HI> it appeared that the e&s;tabli&s;hed Revenue did amount to no more than Fourteen Millions of Livers <HI>French</HI> Money.</P>
<P>One half of this Revenue proceeded from the Duties at <HI>Venice</HI> upon the Importation and Exportation of goods, in the exci&s;e upon Provi&s;ions, and all other Merchandi&s;es &s;old at the tenth penny Duty, and duties ari&s;ing from the <HI>I&s;lands</HI> of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> as likewi&s;e upon all goods in the Limits of the Country near <HI>Venice,</HI> which is called the <HI>Dutchy</HI> or <HI>Do|gate.</HI></P>
<P>The other part of this Revenue ri&s;es from the Cities and Provinces of <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> in impo&s;itions upon Goods, Provi&s;i|ons, cu&s;tom of Merchandi&s;e, in Tithes and the Tenth Penny, as likewi&s;e from what is rai&s;ed in <HI>I&s;tria, Dalmatia</HI> and the three <HI>I&s;lands</HI> of <HI>Corfu, Zant</HI> and <HI>Chefal|nia.</HI></P>
<P>To this Revenue mu&s;t be added the Ca|&s;ual Emoluments of the Palace, Sale of Offi|ces, Confi&s;cations, and &s;everal other Duties that amount to con&s;iderable Summs. The Salt Works at <HI>Corfu</HI> produc'd two Millions; that at <HI>Chio&s;a,</HI> one; by which it appears that the Republick received above Eighteen Millions.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="140">
In War the Republick Augments the old impo&s;itions and e&s;tabli&s;hes new ones, Taxes the ea&s;y, and the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks,</HI> from whom by the Pope's con&s;ent &s;he draws very con&s;iderable Summs, in all her Wars again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> They likewi&s;e obtained the Abolition of &s;everal Orders as tho&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t and the Croi&s;ade, the Sale of who&s;e effects amounted to very con&s;i|derable Summs,</P>
<P>The Republick doubles the Contributions of all the City Companies, as likewi&s;e tho&s;e of the <HI>Gondaliers,</HI> the Six Great Confraternities of the City who are very Rich; &s;he draws be&s;ides great Summs from the Jews, who were oblig'd in the late Nece&s;&s;ities of the State to a Loan of Three Millions at three <HI>per Cent.</HI> Be&s;ides the particular Taxes of the Richer Jews, which amounted al&s;o to three Millions of Livers.</P>
<P>At the opening of the entrance into the Great Council by the Creation of new No|bles, the Republick hath in a manner al|ways acquired Inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ures; the great Number of Supernumerary Procura|tors of Saint <HI>Mark,</HI> who Purcha&s;e their Dignities at Thirty Thou&s;and Ducats each; have been very Powerful Supplies to the Exigencies of this State<HI>:</HI> in&s;omuch that the&s;e extraordinary ways of rai&s;ing Money, the mo&s;t important of which are here only mentioned, have been the&s;e Rich Mines
<PB N="164" REF="141">
from which the Republick have found the means of making that Re&s;i&s;tance, which hath been the Admiration of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed expences of the Republick do not annually exceed Ten Millions of Livers, which are partly employed to defray the charges of the Doge, of Amba&s;&s;adors, the Salaries of Officers, the pay of both Hor&s;e and Foot upon <HI>Terra Firma</HI> and in the Levant, as likewi&s;e to defray the charges of the Navy, Arcenal and Fortifica|tions of the State. As to the other ex|pences which the Republick is oblig'd to, in cleaning the Canals of <HI>Venice,</HI> and for the maintenance of &s;uch as Lie Commodi|ous and u&s;eful to the City, there are cer|tain Summs ari&s;ing from &s;everal Impo&s;itions that are to this purpo&s;e given, and particularly applied to the&s;e matters; Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ides, the In|habitants of the Country are all oblig'd by &s;ome Light con&s;ideration to &s;o many Days Work each man.</P>
<P>The Summs which the Republick pays for intere&s;t of money upon the <HI>Zecque,</HI> or Trea&s;ury Chamber, are comprehended within the Calculation of Ten Millions; but &s;ince the Peace of <HI>Candia</HI> the Republick hath di&s;charg'd her &s;elf of the great Intere&s;t &s;he payed for Sums lent upon the Bank of <HI>Venice,</HI> by Incorporating them into the Con&s;titution at three per cent; but as they only payed the half of that Intere&s;t, by

Rea&s;on of the great Nece&s;&s;ities of the State during the late War, &s;o they have turn'd the Arrears into Principal, for which is allowed two <HI>per cent.</HI> The Republick hath moreover reduc'd to five all other Summs that were formerly at &s;ix, &s;even and eight <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>There being a great deal due to the Officers that had &s;erved the Republick in the late Wars, they thought fit to Pub|li&s;h a declaration importing that no Officers &s;hould be payed, but tho&s;e who&s;e accounts were admitted, and even they were only to receive the half of what appeared in their accounts; the Republick did not only thus avoid taking notice of the damage &s;he did to particulars by the&s;e &s;orts of Retrench|ments, that &s;o much Augmented her Trea|&s;ure, by con&s;iderably dimini&s;hing her charge, but they likewi&s;e order no payment that is not ballotted in the College and Senate; &s;o they are &s;ure to be oppre&s;s'd with charges that pro&s;ecute their debts, for her cu&s;tom is to pay no more than a very moderate part at a time.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the Republick in times of Peace does every year bring &s;everal Mil|lions, into the Coffers of the Trea&s;ury. Which is the more ea&s;y by rea&s;on their Trea&s;ury is not only manag'd with an exact fidelity, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e there can be no new Employ made without having a

<HEAD>Of the Education and Manners of the Young Nobility.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be true, That Education does not con|tribute le&s;s to the Improvement of Youth, than the Natural Di&s;po&s;ition to Good; one ought not to wonder at the young Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> who not being re&s;train'd by tho&s;e Con&s;iderations that u&s;ually engage Young People to the Principles of Vertue, or at lea&s;t that pre&s;erves them from Vice; &s;hould Live &s;o Irregularly and &s;hew &s;o little Moderation in their Conduct. I pretend to &s;peak now only of the Young Nobility; as not de&s;igning to en|gage my &s;elf here to a General De&s;cription of the Cu&s;toms and Inclinations of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> which will be &s;ufficiently &s;hewn in the cour&s;e of this Account.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="145">
The Fathers and Mothers here are &s;o infinitely Fond of their Children, that they never lay any re&s;traint upon them; for whom they have &s;o great a Complacency as never to deny them a|ny thing they de&s;ire. They are no &s;ooner able to go, but they begin to Cloath them with the Riche&s;t things, and at Five or Six Years Old they put them into the black Habit, and Cloak ruffled with Gold or Silver-Laces, their fondne&s;s even reaches the Shoes, for they are then rais'd with very high Heels, which are to make them look Taller than they really are; and doubtle&s;s this may be one rea&s;on of their Walking &s;o very ill as they do ever afterwards.</P>
<P>It is not anly this blind Affection of the Pa|rents that fir&s;t begins to corrupt the Manners of their Young People, by rendring them Haugh|ty, Imperious, La&s;civious, and violent in all their Pa&s;&s;ions, but the &s;ordid Flattery of their Dome&s;tick Servants does &s;trangely help to in|crea&s;e the Ill: For tho&s;e Creatures think to e|&s;tabli&s;h their Fortunes by getting the&s;e Young Gentlemen to be their fa&s;t Protectors, for which purpo&s;e they u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours as be|ing well a&s;&s;ured that there is nothing that they may not hope for at <HI>Venice,</HI> when they are under the protection of one of their Powerful Hou&s;es upon which Con&s;iderations the&s;e Children are Ador'd and Regarded as the certain hope of their ri&s;ing Fortune.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen being thus early accu&s;tom'd to be Treated like Princes, and finding no oppo|&s;ition to the Career of their De&s;ires, do in&s;en&s;i|bly po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves with the thoughts of be|ing Superior to all other Per&s;ons of Quality;
<PB N="5" REF="145">
but when they begin to perceive that they are the only Mighty in the State, they then elevate the Notion to that degree as to become In&s;up|portable to all others. For which Rea&s;on it is ve|ry rare for Strangers to find much Civility from tho&s;e People, unle&s;s it be among tho&s;e that have learn'd the Rules of good Breeding in o|ther Countries; of which number &s;uch as have &s;een <HI>France</HI> do much di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>One may vainly imaginy that if this Young Nobility is not engag'd to the Study of good Let|ters, by the Natural Inclination join'd to a great di&s;po&s;ition of Learning; there cannot be ma|ny expected to penetrate very far into the know|ledge of the Sciences; in&s;omuch that whatever Care is taken about the In&s;truction of the&s;e Gentlemen either in the School or their Hou&s;es, yet they are not to be prevail'd upon to exceed what they them&s;elves think fit. In the mean time the Parents do not much trouble them|&s;elves about the matter, for they are contented with the hopes of &s;eeing them <HI>Venetian</HI> Politi|ans at la&s;t: However in this numerous Nobili|ty there are &s;ome Gentlemen that Naturally take to Study, which they follow with great Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the&s;e Young Gentlemen are Six|teen or Seventeen Years Old, they begin to A&s;|&s;ociate with tho&s;e of a more advanc'd Age, and to pur&s;ue their Plea&s;ures with the ample&s;t liber|ty: As they do not want Precedenrs in the Company they keep, nor for Opportunities in this Famous City of <HI>Venice;</HI> &s;o it may ea&s;ily be imagined without any farther In&s;tances, what

&s;ort of a Life they lead. Such as have Money commonly &s;pend it in Plea&s;ure, for they are not contented with one Courti&s;an, but employ it to the Support of &s;everal: Their Parents are &s;o far from oppo&s;ing the Libertini&s;m, that on the contrary, they u&s;ually contribute to the Exce&s;s; or at be&s;t, but &s;hut their Eyes to the Extravagancy of their Conduct.</P>
<P>The Son of a Procurator by Merit, that had a great &s;hare in the Dogal Dignity, after the Death of the Doge <HI>Contarini,</HI> was &s;o mightily in Love with the mo&s;t Beautiful and Hone&s;te&s;t Courti&s;an of <HI>Venice</HI> (if there are any &s;o) that he never &s;tirr'd from her.

<P>Such of the&s;e Gentlemen as have not where|withal to &s;upport the Charge of their De&s;ires, wreck their Inventions to acquire the Means of &s;upplying their Nece&s;&s;ities. They be&s;tow their Protections upon Per&s;ons that are able to ac|knowledge the Favour, and if they are tho&s;e forward Gentlemen that are always ready to a&s;|&s;ert the Value of their Merits, or of them that are become formidable for their Violencies and Bully-Deeds, they make a greater noi&s;e by their Names, and occa&s;ion more Terrour to all that are concerned with them, than the principal Senators are able to effect with their ample&s;t Authorities.</P>

<P>This Proceeding of the&s;e Gentlemen is call'd at <HI>Venice, Tenir Tribunale,</HI> altho' it is odious to the Republick, and contrary to the Laws and Liberties of the Subject; neverthele&s;s all Eyes are generally clos'd to the&s;e Di&s;orders.

them&s;elves to a Game that is not ordinarily us'd for &s;mall Sums. Not long &s;ince, one of the fir&s;t Senators of the Republick, &s;upported with much Affliction, the frequent Lo&s;&s;es which his Son receiv'd at Play: However he was afraid to di&s;cover plainly to him the Grief it gave him, and only ventur'd to &s;ay one Night, upon his lo&s;ing of two Hundred <HI>Hungars, Tu te &s;ei portato bene oggi;</HI> You have play'd your Part very well to Day: To which the Son reply'd very briskly, <HI>Non voglio que&s;ti mu&s;i,</HI> I do not de&s;ire to be &s;o received; and the very next Day he left <HI>Venice,</HI> acquainted his Father by one of his Friends, that he was not to expect to &s;ee him any more; and that he was then going to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Grief of the Affiicted Father for the lo&s;s of his Son; who in a di&s;tracted condition enquir'd of every one he &s;aw. <HI>Is it po&s;&s;ible for me to live without the pre|&s;ence of my Son!</HI> Revien caro mio figliolo Pietro. <HI>Return my dear Child, and you &s;hall not only have the Two hundred Hungers but likewi&s;e the Keys of my Ca&s;h,</HI> and forthwith di&s;patch'd away &s;eve|ral Expre&s;&s;es with Money to bring back the Son whom he never expected to &s;ee more.</P>
<P>It may be imagined from hence, if the Young Nobility who are Educated with &s;o much ten|derne&s;s, equally adored by their Parents and Servants, free of all re&s;traint, accu&s;tom'd to pur&s;ue with the ample&s;t liberty all the Motives of their De&s;ires, moreover po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an imaginary Opinion of them&s;elves, and of the Power they have to make them&s;elves obeyed ei|ther through Fear or Authority: If the&s;e Gen|tlemen,
<PB N="10" REF="148">
I &s;ay, who are thus educated, ought not to be very different in all things from tho&s;e that are educated in other Countries; but more e&s;|pecially in <HI>France,</HI> where the &s;tudy of good Let|ters, the Exerci&s;es of the Body and the Conver|&s;ation of Per&s;ons of Wit and Virtue, do u&s;ually employ the more tender Years of Per&s;ons of Quality.</P>
<P>As the Young Nobility are in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;&s;ured to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, &s;o they are &s;carce to be retain'd from their extravagances by any manner of con&s;ideration, of which take the fol|lowing Example. About four or five years &s;ince five Young Gentlemen not knowing how to pa&s;s away the Evening, agreed among them&s;elves to do &s;omething that might make a noi&s;e and them&s;elves talked of. One propos'd to &s;et on fire <HI>Il Ghetto,</HI> that part of the City Inhabited by the <HI>Jews;</HI> another was of Opinion to force into the Houfe of one the hand&s;ome&s;t Ladies at <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> and there to execute what their plea&s;ure prompted them to; but the propo&s;ition of the third Man was agreed upon as mo&s;t agreeable to the&s;e Gentlemen. He &s;aid that a Nunnery of the Order of Saint <HI>Francis</HI> in a certain I&s;land two Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Venice</HI> was at that time Repairing, and that he thought they could not pa&s;s the tsme better than to take that opportu|nity of entring the Breach.</P>
<P>All of them immediately Dre&s;s'd them&s;elves in White, took Boats and atriv'd at the Place about Midnight, which they entred unto the very Dormitories. The fir&s;t of the Religious that came running out upon the noi&s;e by her &s;hricks alarm'd the whole Covent, upon which
<PB N="11" REF="148">
the Bell was Rung, and &s;everal of the Inha|bitants came to give their A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But the Nobles not thinking them&s;elves &s;afe fled to theit Gondolo's, and return'd to <HI>Venice.</HI> This Action was mightily nois'd about in the Morning, various were the Opinons upon this Di&s;order at the Nunnery, and &s;everal different Relations made of it; but at the end of Three Days the Authors were di&s;cover'd and Bani&s;h'd the City upon very rigorous Penalties: Yet in le&s;s than Six Months they appear'd there again without any farther Notice being taken of them.</P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s certain that there are a great many Civil Gentlemen among the Young Nobility of <HI>Venice;</HI> yet they are generally the&s;e as have &s;pent &s;ome time in other Countries; who having &s;een another Nobility in <HI>Europe,</HI> which not being le&s;s regarded for their Per&s;onal Merits than for their Births, do ob&s;erve a quite different Conduct, and by their Civilities they &s;hew to Strangers, which is even &s;ometimes to exce&s;s, do mightily di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from tho&s;e Nobles that were never out of their State.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Habit of the Nobles.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ob&s;erv'd that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility have ever imitated the long Garnment of the <HI>Le|vant,</HI> and the ancient Cu&s;tom of <HI>Rome.</HI> For &s;e|veral Ages pa&s;t rhey did wear along Blew Robe; but at length it was unalterably fix'd to a long back Ve&s;t that comes down to the Ground: The Sleeves are half an Ell wide and come down to the Wri&s;t: They are made very narrow at the
<PB N="12" REF="149">
end, leaving only &s;pace enough to put through the Hand, but the Sleeve is round at the bottom of the end like a Night-Gown, in which the Nobility carry what others u&s;ually wear in the Pockets of their Coats. The Collar of the Ve&s;t is rais'd directly up round about the Neck, and open before; as likewi&s;e the Doublet which is very high and of the &s;ame &s;hape. A &s;tarch'd little round Band is &s;ow'd to the in&s;ide Shirt negligently falls a Finger's breadth over the Col|lar of the Wa&s;tcoat, and the Neck of the which is u&s;ually fa&s;tned with a Gold or Diamond-Buckle. In Summer they wear the Ve&s;t open and flying back, the forepart being lined with Black Taffaty. But the indi&s;pen&s;able Obligati|on of having it in all Sea&s;ons of <HI>Padua-</HI>Cloth, is during the great Heat, a mo&s;t in&s;upportable Puni&s;hment to the greate&s;t part of the Nobility.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen are all mighty fond of the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion, for they wear under their Ve&s;ts very pretty Wa&s;tcoats of Black Silk; but they always run into Exce&s;s, &s;ometimes by &s;hort lit|tle Wa&s;tcoats Scallop'd at the bottom, or el&s;e with others very large, and odly ruffled with Laces. Altho' they are forbid the U&s;e of <HI>Points of Venice,</HI> yet the Necks and Wri&s;ts of their Shirts are frequently Laced with them, as like|wi&s;e the Back of the Sleeve; and that this may be more &s;een, they u&s;ually turn up the Sleeve of the Ve&s;t, which ought to be worn over their Hands; for the Taylors that make the&s;e Ve&s;ts, are obliged under great Forfeitures, to cut the Sleeves long, and the Ve&s;t &s;hort, that is, &s;o as it may not hang upon the Ground, which is the direct contrary to what they de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="149">
All tho&s;e that wear the Ve&s;t as Senators, No|bles, and Citizens, have only on their Heads a knit Cap of Wor&s;ted, which is edg'd about with a &s;ort of long wrought Fleece-Wool, that &s;omething re&s;embles a Hat-band. The greate&s;t part of the Young Nobility, wear this Cap more in their Hands than upon their Heads; by which u&s;e, and the care they have of their Hair, one &s;ees here &s;uch beautiful Heads, that are no where el&s;e to be found. However this did not prevent them from making u&s;e of Sci&s;ars, when they were &s;o earne&s;tly bent upon Perukes; the U&s;e of which is yet forbidden: However they begin to fall into them again, and the more by rea&s;on the Inqui&s;itors of State are ea&s;ily prevail|ed upon to permit the Wear of the &s;hort Wig and Cap. I doubt not but that they will be permitted again, for the&s;e they wear at pre&s;ent, do perceptibly become longer every Day more than other; in&s;omuch that a little more time will, without di&s;pute, render that Fa&s;hion ge|neral.</P>
<P>They are oblig'd to wear a Stole of an Ell long over their Ve&s;ts; this is a certain breadth of the &s;ame Cloath with the Ve&s;t, doubled and &s;owed together, with two very large Li&s;ts at the Ends: This is ca&s;t over the left Shoulder, to one of which ends was formerly fa&s;tned the Cap, as are at pre&s;ent the <HI>Aumuce</HI> of the Regular Can|nons; &s;o the other end of this Stole, or Hang|ing-Sleeve, came almo&s;t down to their Heels: At pre&s;ent this is e&s;teem'd for a Mark of Au|thority, a Noble dares not appear at the <HI>Broglio</HI> without this on the Shoulder: However the Ci|tizens that wear the Ve&s;t, have the &s;ame Badge,
<PB N="14" REF="150">
with which they all cover their Head, when they chance to be &s;urprized in the Streets by a Shower of Rain.</P>
<P>Only the Coun&s;ellors of the Doge, the Pro|curators of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> the Pre&s;idents of the Council of <HI>Ten,</HI> the great Sages, and the Sa|ges of <HI>Terra firma,</HI> are excu&s;ed from the In|conveniencies of this heavy Garment in Sum|mer, who by a particular Privilege wear, as it has been ob&s;erved, a Ve&s;t of fine Camblet. But as the Nobility may be pitied in this Sea|&s;on, &s;o they are no le&s;s to be envied in Winter<HI>:</HI> For in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> they begin to line their Ve&s;ts with Furs, the more Ancient in|tirely through the Body; but others the Extre|mities and Sides only, with a Border of fine Blewi&s;h Fur, about four Fingers broad, that comes down on each Side from the top to the bottom of the Ve&s;t, the &s;ame is edg'd round the Hand of the Sleeve: This Border, or Edging, comes about a Finger's breadth below the bot|tom of the Ve&s;t on the in&s;ide. The Ve&s;t is cro&s;s'd over their Stomachs from the Left to the Right, which they fa&s;ten by a Girdle of Velvet about three Fingers broad, which they wear about their Wa&s;tes; this Girdle is &s;titch'd on the Sides with an Edging of Silk, it is A|dorn'd with a dozen Silver-Bo&s;&s;es that cover the whole fore part of the Girdle. This is made exactly to the bigne&s;s of the Wa&s;te, for at the Ends there are two large Silver-Ha&s;ps, which cla&s;p together over the Belly.</P>
<P>Nothing can look greater than this &s;ort of Habit, under which the Nobility &s;eem to be well made; they commonly turn back the fore|part
<PB N="15" REF="150">
of the Ve&s;t with the Left-hand, carrying he Right upon the Stomack in the opening of the Ve&s;t, whereby is commonly &s;een the Handle of their Dagger. One that would not look ve|ry well in our Champaign-Dre&s;s, makes an ex|traordinary Figure in the Ve&s;t: For few of them have their Legs well made, or Straight; be&s;ides they generally turn their Feet inwards: This fault is common to both Sexes at <HI>Venice,</HI> for the Policy of the Country does not permit to the Ladies the Advantage of Dancing-Ma&s;ters; and the Negligence of the Young Nobility is &s;uch, that they will not long con&s;train them|&s;elves to go otherwi&s;e, altho' they have had the good Fortune to meet with &s;ome Foreign Ma|&s;ters, that have given them the nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tru|ctions.</P>
<P>The Young Nobility are not oblig'd to wear this Habit unle&s;s they have attain'd to the Years of entring into the Great Council, which is at Twenty five, provided they are not of the Thir|ty which by particular Privilege are by Lot drawn every Year, from among tho&s;e above Twenty two, that give in their Names for their chance to this Preferment. Neverthele&s;s their Parents; if they can per&s;wade them to it, put them into the Ve&s;t at Fifteen or Sixteen, for this Garment which is by the Republick call'd the Habit of their Religion, does in &s;ome mea|&s;ure oblige &s;uch as wear it, to ob&s;erve &s;ome Rules of Decency, and engage them to live with more Moderation than tho&s;e that are not ho|nour'd with it.</P>
<P>Yet the Nobility are not the only Per&s;ons that wear at <HI>Venice</HI> this &s;ort of Apparel. The
<PB N="16" REF="151">
Phy&s;itians, Lawyers, Secretaries of the Repu|blick, Notaries, &s;everal other Officers of the Pa|lace; and a great many Citizens have the &s;ame Apparel without any manner of di&s;tinction; in&s;omuch that without a great familiarity with them, it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to make any di&s;tinction between them. It has been often times propo&s;ed to have &s;ome external Mark, whereby the Nobility might be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from &s;uch as are not of that Body, but the Se|nate could never be induced to admit of the propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay that the intention of the Republick is thereby to &s;hew the number of their Nobility larger than it really is, and by that means ren|der it more con&s;iderable in the thoughts of their Subjects and tho&s;e Strangers that come to <HI>Venice:</HI> Others imagine that the Nobility think them|&s;elves &s;afer by this mixture; for if there &s;hould happen again any Con&s;piracies again&s;t the whole Body of the Nobility, they would have le&s;s op|portunity of &s;aving them&s;elves; as being now in a manner undi&s;cernably mix'd with a multi|tude of them which &s;uch Con&s;pirators would not de&s;troy. I am of the opinion that this Ha|bit being in common between the Citizens and Nobility, does not a little help to acquire the&s;e the friend&s;hip of the Former, who are part of the Principal Members in the Body of this State, and who are much better beloved by the People than the Nobility, as being infinitely more o|bliging and Moderate.</P>
<P>Yet certain it is that the Republick has very good Rea&s;ons in adhering to the&s;e Re&s;olutions, for &s;he is ab&s;olutely again&s;t all Innovations of
<PB N="17" REF="151">
this Nature, notwith&s;tanding the Shame which the Dignity of this Ve&s;t receives, by a great many dirty Wretches going in it to Market to buy a Penny-worth of Anchovies. I do not mean any of tho&s;e Gentlemen that do it for their Plea&s;ure, by &s;ending home what they like, which is the common Cu&s;tome of <HI>Italy,</HI> and many Provinces of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>As the Habit of a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> attracts a Re&s;pect to them that wear it, &s;o it reduces them to &s;uch a Servitude to the Nobility, that except|ing tho&s;e who are by their Employs oblig'd to wear the Ve&s;t, few of the Citizens are found willing to put it on; for in the mo&s;t of tho&s;e Families that have &s;everal Children, they give it him that is lea&s;t capacitated for any other Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and which is only to pre&s;erve to the Fa|mily the Honour of having the Ve&s;t. The com|mon People, Strangers, and all other Per&s;ons are no ways obliged to &s;hew any particular Re|&s;pect upon meeting any of the Nobility in the Streets, and by the Liberty of the Country their Gentlemen do not expect to be &s;aluted by them, but if any of tho&s;e wearing the Ve&s;t, who are not Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s by them with|out making their profounde&s;t Re&s;pects to their Excellencies, of which <HI>Venice</HI> abounds, they would po&s;&s;ibly expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;omething more &s;evere than a &s;imple Reprimand.</P>
<P>The Young Nobility cannot behold a Citizen in a Ve&s;t, without Contempt and &s;ome &s;ort of Envy, who are by this means as well clad as them&s;elves; be&s;ides, they are &s;en&s;ibly touched to &s;ee their Inferiours &s;o perfectly re&s;embling to them; and their Capriciou&s;ne&s;s hath &s;o far

<P>ALL Ladies, whither Citizens, or Stran|gers, that are of a Condition, above the <HI>Plebeians,</HI> a&s;&s;ume at <HI>Venice</HI> the Quality of <HI>Gen|tledonna;</HI> yet only the Wives and Daughters of the Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> can properly be cal|led <HI>Gentledonna</HI>'s, and <HI>Patricie Venete.</HI></P>
<P>They are for the mo&s;t part large of Stature, Maje&s;tick, High and Di&s;dainful in appearance; for I am per&s;waded that in private they want neither Sweetne&s;s nor Complai&s;ance; they on|ly &s;eem to be of this Humour, as not having that Air of Quality which the Ladies of other Countries have, by living more &s;ociably, and le&s;s retired from the Commerce of the World.</P>
<P>Their way of living is &s;o particular and re&s;er|ved, that it is not altogether exempt of Bruti&s;h|ne&s;s; they never, or very rarely vi&s;it each other, and if they happen to meet any where, they do not conver&s;e together, unle&s;s they are very particular Friends; and even this only hap|pens among them that have e&s;tabli&s;hed a parti|cular Society, In the main they are continually at home and Undre&s;s'd, excepting on Holidays, and &s;ome other Publick Solemnities of the Church, at which the&s;e Ladies do u&s;ually ap|pear,
<PB N="19" REF="152">
at lea&s;t they who&s;e Husbands (are le&s;s Jealous, and more Affable than a great many o|thers) have &s;o much Complai&s;ance as to permit them to go to Church, which is one of the greate&s;t Diver&s;ions they enjoy, and they &s;tay there as long as they can, before they return: Yet there are tho&s;e who allow their Wives no farther Liberty than to perform their Devotions in the neare&s;t Church to them. Some carry this exce&s;s of Jealou&s;ie to a higher degree, who without any &s;cruple make their own Hou&s;es their Wives Pri&s;ons, from whence they are ne|ver permitted to &s;tir.</P>
<P>Of &s;ix or &s;even Hundred Ladies of <HI>Venice,</HI> there are not above fifty or &s;ixty that appear at Church at a time, or any where Publickly. But upon any general Rejoycing (or at the Marriage of a Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Quality, upon which oc|ca&s;ions the Ladies are u&s;ually invited, as they were to a &s;plendid Ball at an Academy about two Years &s;ince) upon this occa&s;ion there appear'd a mighty Number, among which few could be &s;aid to be either beautiful, or agreeable, but e|&s;pecially the la&s;t of the&s;e Charms was general|ly wanting. There are &s;everal of tho&s;e that are allowed by their Husbands to appear abroad, who are Agreeable, Gentile, and very Hand|&s;ome: However they are &s;trangely Accoutred through the great de&s;ire they have to follow the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hions; for they always run be|yond the Rules of the Mode, by the ill Judg|ment of their lamentable Taylors.</P>
<P>In former Years they Dre&s;s'd them&s;elves with great Bunches of Ribbans on each Shoul|der;
<PB N="20" REF="153">
and when the Men left off tho&s;e Knots of Ribans, for large Tufts of Silver and Gold, the Ladies did the &s;ame, wearing great Knots of that Work upon their Shoulders, and To&s;&s;els at their Girdles tagg'd with great Points. As the Old and Deform'd love to &s;pruce them&s;elves no le&s;s than the Young; &s;o they Curl, Powder, and cover them&s;elves to that degree with Ribans &s;o ill &s;uited to their Age and Complexions, that in reality one cannot &s;ee a more extraordinary Figure, than one of the&s;e antiquated Ladies u|&s;ually make.</P>
<P>In coming from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> one finds &s;o great a difference between the Air of the&s;e Ladies, and tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> as one would not believe that the Eyes &s;hould ever be able to Fancy them. But having &s;een the other Parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> one &s;oon acknowledges that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies appear very well, and if the Severity that is ob&s;erved upon their account, did not re|&s;train them, they would always appear in that Magnificence they are &s;ometimes &s;een when they are permitted to &s;hew them&s;elves in their Pearls and Jewels.</P>
<P>Next to their fine Points, and magnificent Gowns of Gold or Silver Ti&s;&s;ue, they have no|thing that does adorn them more, or better be|comes them, than the Flowers they wear, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e on their Heads; they have an ex|traordinary Fancy in di&s;po&s;ing of them in their large Commodes: As the&s;e Flowers have an ad|mirable good effect in their Dre&s;&s;es, &s;o they have of them for all the &s;everal Sea&s;ons of the Year. It is the mo&s;t agreeable Pre&s;ent that a
<PB N="21" REF="153">
Lover can make to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and he in return takes it for a mo&s;t peculiar Favour to have that Flower be&s;towed upon him, that hath had the preference of the re&s;t, by having been worn in the middle of her Bo&s;om, which they ever have very much expo&s;ed to view.</P>
<P>When a Lady goes into the Church, &s;he moves very &s;lowly; her Gown is very long and large, training upon the Ground. The u&s;e of Pages or Footmen, being utterly unknown at <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;he is forc'd to choo&s;e her own Place, which &s;he does with the greate&s;t Air of Haughtine&s;s, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing both Citizen and Gentleman, without &s;hewing any Demon&s;tration of Civility for the Place &s;he takes from either: As their Parents, when they are Children, nor their Husbands after they are Married do much regard, if they can make the Reverence cu&s;tomary with other Ladies; &s;o there are very few that know how to acquit them&s;elves of it, when they are indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to receive the Salute, or to return the Civility to any Per&s;on of great Con&s;ideration; they are then out of Countenance; for they per|form that Civility by three &s;everal Motions, bending the Knees, lifting up the Belly, and nodding the Head to each Ge&s;ture, all which is done with Eyes and an Air that &s;ufficiently ex|plain the Confu&s;ion they are under.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies are attended to the Church, by as many Waiting-Women as they have, who do not &s;tir one &s;tep from their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es, for they u&s;ually &s;tand in the greate&s;t Crowds both before and behind their Ladies, not a little proud to wait upon Per&s;ons of that
<PB N="22" REF="154">
Quality: Nothing can be more inconvenient than the&s;e Troops of Waiting-Women, in &s;uch great Crowds; yet the Nobility are no ways backward in Civility to them, by rea&s;on of the good Offices they are able to do them, but more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e that wait upon the more beautiful Ladies.</P>
<P>The&s;e Waiting-Women, part of whom being hired only for Days of Ceremony, are all clad in Gowns of black Serge, and great Taffeta Scarfs; they are u&s;ually &s;o familiar with their Ladies, that Strangers do wonder, not without rea&s;on, to &s;ee them upon their Knees leaning a|gain&s;t their Ladies, but &s;uch ought to know that the&s;e Women are all the Company they have at home, with whom they pa&s;s their time in working of <HI>Point de Veni&s;e,</HI> and con&s;equently are fallen into the Cu&s;tom of Laughing and Talking familiarly with them.</P>
<P>The Unmarried Ladies, never &s;ee the Light in Publick, but through a great Veil of fine white Gau&s;e, which comes down before to the bottom of their Gowns, the two corners are tied with Knots of Ribbans that hang ju&s;t above the Ground. This Veil being thus ca&s;t over them, covers their Arms and Face, which they &s;ometimes remove with their Hands, yet only &s;o far as is requi&s;ite to &s;ee be|fore them. In this manner the Young Ladies of Quality go to Church upon Holy-days, and as for other occa&s;ions of going abroad; they are Strangers to them.</P>
<P>This Veil hath &s;omething of Maje&s;ty in it, and becomes them very well that do not cover
<PB N="23" REF="154">
their Faces with it. The Young Ladies of Qua|lity that de&s;ign to be Religious, wear it in that manner &s;ome time before they renounce the World; the &s;ame Veil is the u&s;ual Dre&s;s of the City Ladies.

Stran|gers: The <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies wear it &s;ometimes <HI>en de&s;habillee,</HI> e&s;pecially when they are perform|ing their Devotions: I remember &s;ome Emi|nent Preachers exhorted them to the U&s;e of it, at lea&s;t in the Time of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> Week, during which they frequently go to the Sermons that are Preach'd upon that extraordinary Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Reports of tho&s;e prodigious high Shooes or Pattins, that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ladies wore not long &s;ince are really true; for the Daughters of the la&s;t Doge <HI>Dominica Contarini,</HI> were the fir&s;t that freed them&s;elves from this intolerable Fa&s;hi|on.

<HEAD><HI>How the Noble</HI> Venetians <HI>wait upon the Ladies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Young Nobility have u&s;ually no other Bu&s;ine&s;s than to go, if they think fit, upon Sundays and Holy-days, to the Great Council, as al&s;o to appear at the <HI>Broglio,</HI> if they have any Parties to make; the re&s;t of their time is a great Burthen to them, which they commonly &s;pend in &s;erving of the Ladies, for &s;o they call their way of making Love: It is however but of late Days that the Nobility have applied them&s;elves to Court the Ladies, formerly they only frequented the Courti&s;ans, among whom they diverted them&s;elves with le&s;s trouble.</P>
<P>I do not know if the contrary proceeds from the Ladies having more liberty than they were formerly allowed; or that the Fair Sex is be|come le&s;s &s;evere, or probably the Nobles may have judg'd it more advantagious to make their Addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Gentledonna</HI>'s, than continually to frequent the Society of the Publick Courti|&s;ans: However it is, there is &s;carce, at pre&s;ent, a Gentleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> Married, or Unmarried, that does not mo&s;t diligently engage him&s;elf to the Service of &s;ome Lady, and who does not &s;eek all Opportunities of &s;eeing her in Publick, for he cannot expect to have free acce&s;s to her Habitation, or to &s;ee her without danger, but at
<PB N="25" REF="155">
the time of &s;ome Publick Diver&s;ion; or po&s;&s;i|bly in private, when the Corre&s;pondence is &s;et|led, and no more to be done than to take proper Opportunities for the execution of their De|&s;igns; but the frequent Ma&s;querades are the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured and mo&s;t favourable Junctures that our Lovers meet with at <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere Re&s;traint of the Ladies <HI>Gentledonna,</HI> and the many Precautions of their Husbands, and their Brothers in Law, who are &s;ure to be their mo&s;t diligent Ob&s;ervers; as likewi&s;e the Vigilancy of the Servants, who are here &s;trictly required to watch all the Mo|tions of a Wife, who&s;e Husband &s;u&s;pects her Conduct; it is mo&s;t certain notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e and many other Precautions, that Per&s;ons of Quality ever find &s;ome opportunity of making their Pa&s;&s;ion known. A Lady in this Condi|tion, cannot choo&s;e but re&s;ent the Capriciou&s;|ne&s;s of a Husband, or the Re&s;ervedne&s;s of her Parents, which deprive her of the &s;mall Liber|ties that the Cu&s;tom of the Country permits to People of her Quality, and con&s;equently endea|vours to have a faithful Waiting-Woman, or &s;ome other Affectionate Servant, who out of Compa&s;&s;ion, Friend&s;hip, or Intere&s;t, becomes en|gag'd to her Service, although at the Peril of their Lives.</P>
<P>When a Gentleman de&s;igns to &s;erve one of tho&s;e Ladies, that go freely to the Cour&s;e, the Church, and the Parloirs of the Nuns, he then begins to &s;hew him&s;elf very A&s;&s;idu|ous at all tho&s;e Places, he is &s;ure to be &s;een by her as &s;he comes and goes out of her <HI>Gondo|lo;</HI> he pur&s;ues her with his Eyes, and places
<PB N="26" REF="156">
him&s;elf at &s;ome di&s;tance, where in that &s;ilent Language he acquaints her with his Pa&s;&s;ion, which no Body perceives be&s;ides her &s;elf; this great A&s;&s;iduity, and the Language of the Eyes, are the only Means a Lover hath at fir&s;t to ex|plain him&s;elf<HI>:</HI> As this manner of Conver&s;ation is not unknown to the <HI>Italian</HI> Ladies, &s;o they are not long in comprehending the Meaning of it. The Gentleman then endeavours to know if his Service be acceptable to her, by making &s;everal Signs in ob&s;erving of her, as rai&s;ing up of his Hair, putting his Hand to his Face, or taking out his Handkerchief; and if the Lady an&s;wers to the&s;e particular Expre&s;&s;ions by a Motion of the &s;ame Nature, he is no more to que&s;tion her good In|tentions, for without any other Declaration, the Intelligence is e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Lo|vers.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that addre&s;s them&s;elves to Ladies of a more ea&s;ie Acce&s;s, and who are us'd to Gallan|tries of this Nature, make u&s;e of a le&s;s tedious Method; but when they are indi&s;pen&s;ably o|blig'd to ob&s;erve all the&s;e Mea&s;ures, the fir&s;t thing which the Galant does after he hath hopes of Succe&s;s, mu&s;t be to gain the Wait|ing-Woman, whom the Lady dextrou&s;ly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes to him from the re&s;t by affecting to Talk with her in Publick. There is nothing that a <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentleman will not do in the&s;e Occa|&s;ions, he immediately applies him&s;elf to her Father, Mother, her Friends, or Relations, whom he obliges either through Fear, or Affe|ction, to bring him to &s;peak with the Woman. But to engage this Creature to advance his Inte|re&s;ts with her Lady, he mingles his Pre&s;ents
<PB N="27" REF="156">
with Threats and Embraces; but they are eas'd of this trouble when the Lady finds her &s;elf in|clined to the Gallant; for in tho&s;e Occa&s;ions &s;he is never backward in making the nece&s;&s;ary Ad|vances to her Woman.</P>
<P>If the fear of danger to which the&s;e Waiting-Women expo&s;e them&s;elves by rendering Servi|ces of this Nature to the Wives of tho&s;e Hus|bands that do not under&s;tand Rallery, &s;hould ab&s;olutely engage them to refu&s;e the Mediati|on. He mu&s;t then take other Mea&s;ures, he forces the poor Creature to quit the Service of her Lady, and as they are wonderfully adapted to all the Contrivances of Addre&s;s in this Affair; &s;o they are &s;ure to introduce &s;ome other, who&s;e Services will be more effectual, whereby it of|tentimes happens through the violent proceed|ing of &s;ome of the&s;e Gentlemen, who make it a Point of Honour to &s;urmount the mo&s;t diffi|cult Ob&s;tacles, that not only the poor Waiting-Women are nece&s;&s;itated to render the Services de&s;ired of them, but even the Ladies them&s;elves find it nece&s;&s;ary to have a forc'd Complai&s;ance for the&s;e Dangerous Lovers.</P>
<P>After the Gallant hath e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ecret Commerce with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he is &s;ure to be punctually informed of all the Places this Lady de&s;igns to vi&s;it, which are u&s;ually the Churches, and the Parloirs of the Nuns, where the Noble never fails of paying his Attendance; and that he may be more likely to &s;ucceed, he endea|vours by all manner of ways to render the Reli|gious Nun the Friend of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, Advocate to his Suit; for at <HI>Venice</HI> it is no Novelty to find tho&s;e retired from the World, perfectly di|&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="28" REF="157">
to enter into the Confidence of &s;uch Lo|vers; by this means Letters pa&s;s &s;ecurely, the Flowers and other Pre&s;ents are made, which the mo&s;t quick-&s;ighted Husband can never di&s;|cern.</P>
<P>As it is neverthele&s;s impo&s;&s;ible for a Noble to &s;erve his Lady, without the Knowledge of his <HI>Gondoliers,</HI> who are the perpetual Witne&s;&s;es of his private Tran&s;actions, &s;o he makes them to &s;ettle a Friend&s;hip with tho&s;e of the Lady; from this Intelligence, which is confirmed by &s;ome little Intere&s;t, the Gentleman receives all the In&s;tructions, Lights and Services that can po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;ired from the&s;e &s;ort of People, who are extremely faithful to the Nobility in &s;uch Junctures; provided they are none of tho&s;e <HI>Gondoliers</HI> which Jealous Husbands have plac'd with their Wives, particularly to inform them of all their Proceedings, and even what <HI>Gondo|lo</HI>'s &s;eem mo&s;t to follow them at the Cour&s;e, and all other Places.</P>
<P>When our Lovers do not meet with tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles that are not to be &s;urmounted with|out much difficulty, they are not long before they find the means of &s;eeing each other by &s;e|veral different Methods. This is the great Em|ployment not only of the Young Nobilty, but likewi&s;e of &s;uch as are Married; yet what is mo&s;t to be admired, is that the Jealou&s;ie which every where el&s;e makes Rivals bcome the Mor|tal Enemies of each other, oftentimes produ|cing the mo&s;t Tragical Effects, &s;eems here to be of no force, and intirely to have lo&s;t her Sting; for here at mo&s;t &s;he operates only by an indiffe|rent Hatred, which in all other Places, is carried
<PB N="29" REF="157">
to the height of Re&s;entment. But the Genius of this People does not engage them to pro&s;ecute that Method of Revenge which is too frequent with the Nobility of other Countries; be&s;ides, the <HI>Republick</HI> gives her utmo&s;t Endeavours to impo&s;e Silence to their Di&s;putes, and to take up all Quarrels at their fir&s;t breaking out: More|over the&s;e Gentlemen choo&s;e rather to re&s;erve their Revenge for the next Balloting, than to enter into the Li&s;ts of Danger upon Subjects of Gallantry.</P>
<P>Be it Wi&s;dom, Policy, or Moderation in Matter of Love, as indeed it may be &s;o thought by the &s;hort continuance of it, the&s;e things do not in reality proceed to that height they might<HI>:</HI> Moreover, as there is no hand&s;ome Lady that is not followed by &s;everal Lovers, &s;o the&s;e Gen|tlemen are not of a Humour to be treated with Contempt or Partiality; for there is nothing more certain, than that the de&s;ire of receiving &s;ome Favours from their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, is a more probable rea&s;on for the&s;e Proceedings, than any real Love they have to them, which is plain by the Revolutions incident to the&s;e Matters, as likewi&s;e by the Liberty they afterwards take of publi&s;hing the Favours they have received, which mu&s;t &s;eem to any Impartial Per&s;on to be a con|vincing Demon&s;tration of the Vanity of their Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>However great that the Danger is which the Ladies expo&s;e them&s;elves to, by corre&s;pond|ing with the De&s;ires of the Nobles, &s;eeing the Example of &s;uch as have been Poi&s;oned by their Jealous Husbands, are not to be &s;truck out of their Memories, yet they are not always a|ble

<HEAD><HI>Of the Marriages of the Noble</HI> Venetians.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAbellin</HI> reports, That the Ancient Cu&s;tom of <HI>Venice,</HI> was to &s;et up their Daughters by way of Auction, who were delivered to them that offered mo&s;t: This Cu&s;tom was very Ad|vantagious to the Beautiful, their Charms pro|cur'd them many Purcha&s;ers, who endeavour'd to out-bid each other by offering very con&s;idera|ble Sums for the Preference: And that the le&s;s Hand&s;ome might not remain Unmarried, they wi&s;ely applied Part of that Money they recei|ved for the Beautiful, to pa&s;s off tho&s;e now mentioned, to whom Nature had not been &s;uf|ficiently liberal of her Graces, to acquire them Lovers without any other Con&s;ideration. But this Cu&s;tom, it &s;eems, did not continue after the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Republick;</HI> and if at pre&s;ent we ob&s;erve &s;omething &s;ingular in their
<PB N="31" REF="158">
Marriages, it is the Method which is yet &s;ome|times practi&s;ed among the Nobility.</P>
<P>Can any thing in reality be more extraordinary, than to have two People of one Town, and of a like Condition, enter into the Bands of Wed|lock, without ever &s;eeing one the other? This is neverthele&s;s &s;o free from Fiction, that in the time I was Writing the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, a Mar|riage was concluded between a Gentleman that bears one of the greate&s;t Names of <HI>Venice,</HI> who after the Ratification of the Marriage Articles, was yet near upon a Month without knowing what &s;ort of a Lady he had Married; for ac|cording to Ancient Cu&s;tom, after all Matters are agreed upon, the Young Gentleman is to make Love for &s;ome time, <HI>A la mode de Veni&s;e,</HI> by pa&s;&s;ing to and again under the Windows of the Lady, at &s;ome certain Hours in the Even|ing; and the Fair One then appears at the Win|dow both to &s;hew her Self, and to have a full View of him.</P>
<P>The Gentleman I am &s;peaking of, by what he had heard, knew very well that he was not to expect much Beauty with his Lady<HI>:</HI> In&s;omuch that the fir&s;t time he began to perform this Ce|remony in his <HI>Gondolo,</HI> he perceived among &s;e|veral others at the Window, a Face very far from being agreeable; upon which he acknow|ledg'd, That if &s;he was the Lady de&s;igned him, Patience was to be his Support, for he could not have any thing wor&s;e: Yet it &s;eems this Home|ly Per&s;on was po&s;ted there, that his Spou&s;e might afterwards be le&s;s di&s;agreeable to him; for when he knew that it was not her who had appear'd &s;o horrible in his Eyes, he thought
<PB N="32" REF="159">
there was rea&s;on &s;ufficient to be contented. The Per&s;on whom this Gentleman intru&s;ted with the Di&s;covery, and the Progre&s;s he every Day made in the Cour&s;e of his Amours, did her &s;elf a&s;&s;ure me of the truth of the&s;e particular Circum&s;tan|ces, which &s;eemed to me not altogether un|worthy of being mentioned in this Place.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Cu&s;toms re&s;trains the Engag'd Spou&s;e from waiting upon his future Wife, un|til he carries her the Necklace of Pearl, which he is oblig'd to give her; the&s;e fir&s;t Meetings of Per&s;ons that never did &s;ee each other before, have frequently given occa&s;ion to &s;uch extrava|gant Eruptions, that one can hardly conceive a|ny thing like them: This generally proceeds from the Solitary Lives of the Ladies, or pro|bably from the Company of their aukward Wait|ing-Women, with whom they perpetually con|ver&s;e for want of better Society; in&s;omuch that the Uncouthne&s;s of their Natures are rarely po|li&s;hed either by Education, or good Company. I remember one, who in this juncture thinking the Gentleman at fir&s;t &s;ight that was to be her Husband, very ugly; cried out, without min|cing the Matter; <HI>O what an Ugly Face is there! How, am I to &s;pend all my Days with thee? Cer|tainly I &s;hall take care what I do: O che bruto Mu&s;o! Mi ho di &s;tar centi? Ohito.</HI></P>
<P>She was not the fir&s;t that in the&s;e Occa&s;ions made this &s;ort of Compliment to her Husband; neverthele&s;s the&s;e Ladies who are &s;o fierce at fir&s;t, do no &s;ooner enjoy the Liberty of &s;eeing the World, which the Quality of Wife then allows them, but they immediately change that Conduct for Engagements infinitely more agree|able:
<PB N="33" REF="159">
I mean by &s;hewing them&s;elves rather than &s;eeing the World; for the greate&s;t part only ap|pear to be &s;een, without ever enjoying the ad|vantages of Vi&s;its and Conver&s;ation, which re|ctify the Mind, and mightily help to correct the Imperfections of the Body.</P>
<P>Although there are many Brothers in a Fami|ly, yet &s;eldome above one of the whole num|ber Marries; to the end they may pre&s;erve their Riches intire; and he that enters into this Engagement, is &s;eldome the mo&s;t hopeful of all the Brothers, or the more like to attain the principal Dignity of the State; whether the o|thers con&s;ider the troubles attendant to Families as ob&s;tacles that mu&s;t divert their Application from Publick Affairs, in which they place their greate&s;t Honour and mo&s;t important Advan|tages, or that they find &s;ufficient Plea&s;ures in tho&s;e unre&s;train'd Lives they lead, which they e&s;teem amply equal to the Plea&s;ures of Matri|mony, is not to be determin'd by me: But mo&s;t certain it is, that they are very willing to charge the Care of the Family, upon him they judge mo&s;t proper to perpetuate the Name of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom has been the occa&s;ion of that Scandal which is &s;o ready to every Body's Tongue, as believing, That the method of <HI>Ve|nice</HI> is for one Brother to Marry for the con|venience of all the others<HI>:</HI> I can affirm, this is not &s;aid without &s;ome Rea&s;on. Yet it would be of very little purpo&s;e to &s;earch out any in|&s;tances of this matter. For all &s;uch as know the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility, will ea&s;ily agree, That tho&s;e Per&s;ons who make the
<PB N="34" REF="160">

A Gentleman &s;aid one Day to a Woman of Intrigue, upon the ac|count of a <HI>Gentledonna</HI> famous at <HI>Venice</HI> for her extraordinary Beauty, <HI>That it mu&s;t be a great &s;atisfaction to &s;erve a Lady of &s;o much Merit</HI> She replied without He&s;itation, <HI>There was no|thing to be done; Perra la gha quatro cognai in ca&s;e, for that there were Four Brothers in Law at home with her.</HI></P>
<P>The Nobility is permitted by the Laws of the Republick, to Ally them&s;elves to the Families of Citizens, to Marry the Daughters of the Gla&s;s-makers of <HI>Murano,</HI> as likewi&s;e of tho&s;e who Work in Rich Silks of Gold and Silver-Ti&s;&s;ue; by rea&s;on they do enjoy, as has been al|ready ob&s;erv'd, the Privilege of Citizens: In this manner the <HI>Repuhick</HI> gives the Decaying Families frequent opportunities of Re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ing their Fortunes, by Marrying tho&s;e Women where want of Quality is recompens'd in the great Summs they bring to their Husbands: Be|&s;ides, they do not only render the Citizens more Affectionate by the&s;e Alliances which unite them in Blood, and common Intere&s;t to the No|bility; but likewi&s;e in Honouring the&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ions, they make their Commerce Flouri&s;h, and the City Famous in Foreign Countries; &s;o the <HI>Repullick</HI> does hereby continue to pre&s;erve the greate&s;t Advantage emaining to them, which is their Reputation.</P>

Moreover &s;uch as e&s;tabli&s;h any Commerce with them, e&s;teem them for a &s;ort of Young Women who&s;e Parents do rather choo&s;e to throw into the&s;e Places, than to be their Guardians in the World; for here they are &s;ure to &s;pend their Lives with much more Di&s;cretion, than po&s;&s;ibly they might in any other Condition: This Conjecture bani&s;hes all difficulties that might be made again&s;t Courting of them, &s;o they likewi&s;e are no ways offended in hearing them&s;elves agreeably Complimented, and to en|tertain
<PB N="38" REF="162">
that familiariny with the World, which in mo&s;t other Places is only us'd by &s;uch as are par|ticularly engag'd to it.</P>
<P>No People are &s;o well acquainted with Pri|vate Matters, or the Gallantries of particular Per&s;ons, as they really are. There are &s;carce a|ny Amorous Intrigues, wherein they have not &s;ome &s;hare, or to which are not at lea&s;t Confi|dents, for upon this Topick of &s;ecrecy they place their principal Point of Honour and even to admini&s;ter their be&s;t Offices and more effectu|al Endeavours, between the Gentlemen of their particular Acquaintance and &s;uch Ladies as are either their Relations, or their intimate Friends. As they frequently pre&s;ent their Friends of both &s;orts with variety of Pre&s;ents, Flowers and tho&s;e &s;ort of things, &s;o by the means of the&s;e Pre&s;ents, our Lovers convey their Letters and Tokens to the Ladies without giving any manner of Su|&s;picion.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Nuns who have Brothers keeping Courti&s;ans, do rarely mi&s;s taking the opportu|nity of the Ma&s;querades in the <HI>Carneval</HI> to bring the&s;e disguis'd Young Women to their Parloirs, where they take much Plea&s;ure in entertaining them with the Advantages they have of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the Friend&s;hips of their Brothers, they Re|gale and Care&s;s them with Tenderne&s;s, even &s;o far as to call them their Si&s;ters. One ought not to be much &s;urpriz'd at this proceeding, for e|ven tho&s;e Nuns who are Exemplary for their good Lives, and who&s;e Conduct is free of all reproach; yet having made &s;ome &s;ort of intima|cy with Gentlemen that are Strangers, they do expect to be inform'd of their Gallantries, and if
<PB N="39" REF="162">
the&s;e Gentlemen own an Affection to any par|ticular Lady, they earne&s;tly de&s;ire the &s;ight of her, to whom they expre&s;s all the Civilities imaginable; and &s;hew by their little Pre&s;ents the e&s;teem they have for the Gentleman, who&s;e tendere&s;t Affections they have acquir'd.</P>
<P>No Places are more frequented than the Par|loirs of the&s;e Nuns; notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the Magi&s;trates again&s;t the&s;e Mona&s;teries, yet the Nobbes that frequent them, are not to be kept from making their continual Vi&s;its. As there is not a Pretty Young Nun that has not variety of Gallants, &s;o all the vigilance and pre|cautions of the Lady-Abbe&s;s, &s;erve only to make the&s;e Young Creatures more Ingenious in finding of Expedients to try their Lovers. I do remember upon this occa&s;ion, That an Old Aunt chiding her Niece for having an&s;wer'd to the A&s;&s;iduties of an Enamour'd Noble, who &s;tood a great while in the Church to ob&s;erve her at the Grate of the Choir, where &s;he often appear'd, becau&s;e &s;he was not permitted the liberty of the Parloir as &s;he de&s;ir'd; was only an&s;wer'd, <HI>That it was the lea&s;t thing &s;he cou'd do, to avoid being thought Uncivil and Ingrateful to a Gentleman that Honour'd her with his Service.</HI></P>
<P>One of the things mo&s;t inconvenient to the Religious is the openne&s;s of their Parloirs, that is, there are &s;everal Grates in one, or &s;everal Rooms into which all People go without at|tending the coming away of Company there be|fore them. But when they hear how we Con|ver&s;e in <HI>France</HI> with the Nuns in &s;eparate Par|loirs, they do acknowledge, That &s;uch Conve|niencies would be extremely agreeeble to their
<PB N="40" REF="163">
Humours. In <HI>Carnaval-time,</HI> the Parloirs are the Rendevous of the Ma&s;que, and the more they are Buffoon and Ridiculous, the better they are re|ceiv'd. The Young Gentlemen make it their endeavours to Di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves as extrava|gantly as po&s;&s;ibly they can, and then go from Convent to Convent diverting of the Nuns with a Thou&s;and plea&s;ant Cajoleries. The Lady-Ab|be&s;&s;es &s;ometimes appear, to get both the Ma&s;ques and the Religious to retire; but as the&s;e go away of one &s;ide, &s;o they return again on the other; in the mean while the Ma&s;ques Play their Tricks, which oftentimes makes the Abbe&s;s Laugh, and forces her to retire with the Flock.</P>
<P>Upon the la&s;t Days of <HI>Carnaval,</HI> one &s;ees at the Grate of &s;ome of the&s;e Mona&s;teries, &s;eve|ral of the Religious di&s;guis'd in the Dre&s;s of the Fa&s;hion; &s;ome I have &s;een in Mens Cloaths, with Feathers in their Hats, and playing the Gallant in ample&s;t order. I knew a Noble <HI>Ve|netian</HI> that had &s;o great an Engagement for a Beautiful Religious, That when he went to &s;ee her he took his Place in the Parloir as &s;oon as it it was opened in the Morning, where he re|main'd with his Head again&s;t the Grate without ever &s;tirring until the entrance of the Night, and without either Eating or Drinking, unle&s;s a Bi&s;quet, or &s;ome &s;uch thing which the Nun might chance to get him. But to maintain a Conver&s;ation of this length the Lady-Abbe&s;s mu&s;t be deceiv'd, by the diligent watching of her Friend or principal Confident, who are ever ready to render their Friends the like Services in &s;uch Junctures.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="163">
The greate&s;t part of the&s;e Nuns go no oftner to the Choir than they think fit, they Ri&s;e and go to Bed when they plea&s;e, frequently enter|taining each other with what their Acquaintance &s;end them, which oftentimes amount to entire Meals and Collations; that their indu&s;trious Friends get pa&s;s'd into the Convent. By this it &s;eems as if the Inclo&s;ure only di&s;tingui&s;h'd them from People in the World. Notwith&s;tanding the Scandal which this may occa&s;ion, and the Stories that are told of &s;ome Nuns, who have had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Opera, and that they found the means of doing it: Yet I am apt to beleive that the&s;e are Untruths, and that the other Liberties they enjoy, which are of &s;mall Con&s;equence at <HI>Venice,</HI> have been the occa&s;ion of &s;aying more than the Truth in this matter.</P>
<P>One can &s;ee nothing more &s;ingular or a|greable, than the Habits of Five or Six &s;everal Orders of Nuns at <HI>Venice;</HI> for in&s;tead of Vail, Fillet and Biggin, they have only a Forehead|cloth of fine white pleated Gau&s;e, &s;omewhat like tho&s;e that are in <HI>France</HI> worn upon Mournings; with a little Biggin of fine pleated Linnen that covers the Top and Hind-part of the Head, rhe two Ends of which meet under the Throat, their Hair comes out behind, which is Cut &s;o as to fall about the upper part of their Necks; they have their Hair on the Forehead u&s;ually Curl'd, and oftentimes Enamel'd Buckles in their Ears for Pendants.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the Mona&s;teries their Habits are of white Camblet, and their Bodies are &s;tiffened, a &s;ort of fine black Crape is &s;ow'd round about the upper part of their Bodies; this is brought

The Necks of their Shifts are of the fine&s;t Lin|nen and ruffled at Bottom, they come only a little below the Elbow, where being ty'd with Ribbans they have the appearance of Ruffles. As the&s;e Ladies are extremely Neat in their Linnen, the gaye&s;t of them being never without Flo|wers, which they fa&s;ten before them, or in their Bo&s;oms; &s;o it mu&s;t be acknowledged that no|thing can be of a more agreeable effect to the Eye.</P>

<P>I Do not pretend to &s;peak of the Original Li|berty of <HI>Venice,</HI> for tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to inform them&s;elves farther than what is mention'd in the Beginning of the Second Part of this Treati&s;e, may find that Matter in other Works examin'd to the Bottom: I only De&s;ign to &s;ay &s;omething of that Liberty which is at <HI>Venice</HI> &s;o much in every one's Mouth, even from the meane&s;t of the People to the fir&s;t of the Se|nators; <HI>Somo a Venetia, We are in a place of Li|berty.</HI> Which is frequently the An&s;wer for the Incivility of the one, and the In&s;olence of the other &s;ort, who are oftentimes wanting in the Re&s;pect they ought to have for &s;ome Per&s;ons, al|tho' they are not Noble <HI>Venetians.</HI> For the Peo|ple think when they have done what becomes them in this matter to the Nobility, that they are not oblig'd to have a Deference to any others whoever they are.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="164">
I &s;hould be mightily embarra&s;s'd if I were to give an exact Definition of the Liberty of <HI>Ve|nice;</HI> for it does not only comprehend the Free Condition of all the Subjects of the <HI>Republick,</HI> e&s;pecially for the People of <HI>Venice</HI> to follow without re&s;traint what&s;oever may contribute to their Plea&s;ures, provided they are not incompa|tible with the Publick Good; but likewi&s;e this very Liberty comprehends in tho&s;e occa&s;ions where the Authority of the Government is not prejudic'd, an intire exemption from Puni&s;hment, the deficiency of that Re&s;pect which is due from Inferiors to Superiors. True, it &s;eems to me that this Liberty of <HI>Venice</HI> is properly a Politi|cal Libertini&s;m, advantageous to the <HI>Republick,</HI> convenient to the Nobility, and agreable to the People; who are not &s;en&s;ible that this Liberty which they pretend to have above tho&s;e People that are under a Monarchy, is in reality but a vain Chimera.</P>
<P>What has been already &s;aid, &s;ufficiently &s;hews their manner of Living, as al&s;o what are the prin|cipal Occupations and Inclinations of the <HI>Vene|tian</HI> Nobility. Therefore in the remaining Part of this Treati&s;e, I will endeavour to give a live|ly Draught of the real Genius of this People; yet not &s;o as to enter into the particular Con|duct of all &s;orts of Conditions; believing that upon this Subject of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Liberty, e|nough may be &s;aid in general, to &s;hew in what manner they Live at <HI>Venice,</HI> and how every one may Regulate him&s;elf by the Dictates of his own Fancy.</P>
<P>Upon Ob&s;erving of the Religious we &s;hall meet with tho&s;e Irregularities of Conduct that
<PB N="44" REF="165">
are no where el&s;e to be found, and the Rea&s;on of it is, becau&s;e they cannot expect to e&s;cape &s;o e&s;ialy as at <HI>Venice:</HI> Be&s;ides as to the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> no Prince is &s;o much engag'd in Intere&s;t, to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the Religious, by the means of a Liberty that takes from them the E&s;teem of the People, and con&s;equently brings them into a more ab&s;olute Dependance than can be ac|compli&s;h'd by a Soveraign Authority: That the greate&s;t part of the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks are only Ex|emplary for the Scandal they occa&s;ion to their Orders. And as they are generally, of the mean|e&s;t Extraction; &s;o there are very few Hou&s;es of the Nobility, where one of the&s;e Prie&s;ts do not Execute divers different Employs; moreover, it is very rare to hear of an unfortunate Acci|dent and a Prie&s;t not concern'd in the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not to be deny'd, but that there are many Curates of an Irreproachable Life, who are with|out Di&s;pute &s;ufficiently qualify'd to procure &s;ome Moderation in the&s;e Publick Di&s;orders, if the Evil was not Originally without Remedy<HI>:</HI> However when the Reformation of Manners de|pends only upon the Pa&s;tors, it is much to be &s;uppos'd, That for one who &s;hall have the Zeal and Abilities nece&s;&s;ary to perform it, there will be many who&s;e Engagements lying directly op|po&s;ite to the Application of their Duties, will make but a very indifferent progre&s;s in any Works of this Nature. The Liberty of <HI>Venice</HI> makes every thing Authentick, for what&s;oever the Life is, or Religion one Profe&s;&s;es, provided, you do not Talk, or Attempt any thing again&s;t the State, or the Nobility, one may be &s;ure to Live unmole&s;ted, for no Body will go about to
<PB N="45" REF="165">
Cen&s;ure their Conduct, or to oppo&s;e the Di&s;|orders of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>If any tender-con&s;cienc'd Per&s;ons &s;hould be de&s;irous to remove a Courti&s;an out of their Hou&s;e or Neighbourhood; they would not be a|ble to accompli&s;h it without alledging &s;ome Rea|&s;ons be&s;ides the Scandal and bad Example of it; for they take &s;o little notice of things of this Nature, that it is nothing extraordinary to &s;ee a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> Living in the Fir&s;t Story of a Hou&s;e and a Courti&s;an in the Second, or po&s;|&s;ibly this may be &s;ome Place of Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, which the Noble no ways e&s;teems as inconveni|ent to him: Herein con&s;i&s;ts the reality of this Liberty of <HI>Venice;</HI> yet nothing renders the Sub|jection of this People more ea&s;y, than to &s;ee there is no Diver&s;ions at <HI>Venice,</HI> which is not in common between them and the Nobility; for they mingle them&s;elves with tho&s;e of that Illu|&s;trious Body at all Ceremonies, and other Pub|lick Rejoycings without any manner of con&s;traint; and the&s;e Gentlemen of their &s;ides require no &s;ort of external Re&s;pect from them, which Po|licy produces all the good Effects that can po&s;|&s;ibly be expected from &s;uch a Conduct.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Country-People, we &s;hall find them &s;en&s;ible of this Liberty; for be&s;ides their being in a manner almo&s;t exempt from Im|po&s;itions, and free of all Military Quarterings: yet they do moreover find the Government of the <HI>Republick</HI> extremely ea&s;y, by rea&s;on their Po|de&s;tates being only for a &s;hort continuance, and their Admini&s;tration ever liable to a Retro&s;pe|ction, detains them mightily from making the People unea&s;y; therefore the Conduct they ob|&s;erve
<PB N="46" REF="166">
is &s;o much to the contrary, That they ra|ther affect the mo&s;t Popular manner, and even to allow free Acce&s;s to their Palaces when&s;oe|ver they plea&s;e, which &s;trangely gains their Af|fections: They behold al&s;o with much Plea&s;ure the Nobility of <HI>Terra Firma</HI> that are &s;o very proud of their Quality, to be not only treated with the &s;ame mea&s;ure that is us'd to them; but even wor&s;e, for tho&s;e Gentlemen rarely meet with le&s;s &s;everity than the Senate thinks it intirely their Intere&s;t to dimini&s;h their Power; in&s;omuch the People of the Provinces and tho&s;e of the City are equally po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, That they cannot be more Happy than they are under the Government of this <HI>Republick.</HI></P>
<P>This Famous Liberty draws Strangers hither in Multitudes, where the Plea&s;ure and Diver&s;ions of the Place as &s;ure empty their Pockets. Sove|raign Princes and other Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality are frequently there; for that conve|nient Cu&s;tom of being <HI>Incognito</HI> joined to the Charms of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Liberty do mutually engage them to purcha&s;e their Plea&s;ures at ex|traordinary Rates. The late Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> un|cer the Name of <HI>Marque&s;s de Salluces,</HI> was there a con&s;iderable time, in which he con|&s;um'd mighty con&s;iderable Summs: The Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> makes &s;everal Journeys hither in the Plea&s;ant Sea&s;on of the Year, be&s;ides which he never mi&s;&s;es a <HI>Carnaval;</HI> but he Lives in &s;uch a manner at <HI>Venice,</HI> as it plainly appears he does not much apply him&s;elf to what ought to be in|&s;eparable to the Rank and Dignity of a Sove|raign Prince.</P>

For my one part I am certain nothing can be equal to what is Practi&s;ed at <HI>Venice,</HI> both as to the great number of Per&s;ons and the ample liberty which every one takes without the fear of being troubled for it. To &s;ay the truth, the Character of Courti&s;an ac|cording to the Sentiments of the People, does &s;omething dimini&s;h the Credit of them that profe&s;s it, yet on the other &s;ide this Character is &s;o far advantagious as it acquires to them a con|&s;ideration proportionable to the Quality of tho&s;e that frequent them: And as there is not a Cour|ti&s;an who does not &s;helter her &s;elf under the name and protection of &s;ome Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> which they &s;ometimes do at an extraordinary Price; &s;o this renders them re&s;pected by the meaner People, who Envy more their good For|tune, than they have Aver&s;ion to the Trade they Profe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="167">
Two hundred and fifty four Years &s;ince <HI>Venice</HI> being de&s;titute of Courti&s;ans, the <HI>Republick</HI> was oblig'd to procure and encourage the coming in of Foreign Women. <HI>Doglioni</HI> that writ the Re|markable Tran&s;actions of <HI>Venice,</HI> does here much amplify the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Republick,</HI> who by this means provided again&s;t the frequent At|tempts, that were daily made upon the Per&s;ons of many Mode&s;t Women; for even the mo&s;t Sacred Places could not be e&s;teem'd as a&s;&s;ur'd Sanctuaries, and in which the Cha&s;tity of the Women were out of all danger. Therefore as the <HI>Republick</HI> &s;eem'd to believe that the Sea-Air render'd this Di&s;order habitual and without re|medy, &s;o they judg'd it nece&s;&s;ary to provide a|gain&s;t tho&s;e bad effects in permitting the u&s;e of Courti&s;ans, as likewi&s;e by e&s;tabli&s;hing an Order, whereby they might contribute to the mutual Support of each other.</P>
<P>The Conduct of all the&s;e Bonny La&s;&s;es was committed to the direction of an Honourable Matron, to whom was depo&s;ited the Profits they made by their Calling, who every Month di&s;tributed the Sums &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary for them, allowing each of them proportionable to the Merits of what &s;he earn'd. This prudent Conduct has &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Courti&s;ans, that the <HI>Republick</HI> need not fear <HI>Venice</HI> will e|ver want them for the future. All the Streets and Canals are abundantly &s;upplied with the&s;e &s;ort of Ladies; who commonly &s;tand at their Windows and Balconies &s;et out with a mighty profu&s;ion of Ribbans, where they expo&s;e their be&s;t Charms to excite the Inclinations of all pa&s;&s;ing by them; butas they have the Reputa|tation

of being the Hand&s;ome&s;t of all <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;o they have that al&s;o of be&s;towing tho&s;e Pre&s;ents which are not &s;oon to be forgotten.</P>
<P>The Daughters of the Common People a|mong whom there are a great many Pretty Creatures, are the Nur&s;ery that &s;tocks the Cour|ti&s;ans: For the Young Nobility Living in Idle|ne&s;s, place their greate&s;t Diver&s;ions in finding out tho&s;e from among the&s;e Young Women that are mo&s;t agreeable to their Fancies; endeavour|ing by Per&s;wa&s;ions, Promi&s;es and Money to in|duce them to deliver up what is de&s;ired of them. The Gentlemen that are able to pay for their Plea&s;ures choo&s;e the Hand&s;ome&s;t of them, whom they endeavour to have at Eight or Ten Years Old: The&s;e are carefully elevated as Fruits which they De&s;ign to pluck, when at the height of Perfection. But as mo&s;t of the&s;e poor Creatures do at length find them&s;elves betrayed in their Hopes, are at la&s;t reduc'd to take up the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Publick Courti&s;ans</P>
<P>A Gentleman thinks him&s;elf no ways ungrate|ful to a Per&s;on that has treated him with the la&s;t Complai&s;ance, if he a&s;&s;ociates to their Commerce &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial Merchant that con|tributes hand&s;omly to her Maintenance, and his Equivalent is Pay'd in the Protection he gives her. Thus they divide between them the Days of the Week, alternatively enjoying their Plea|&s;ures without any mixture of Jealou&s;y. But the&s;e Gentlewomen mo&s;t commonly grow wea|ry of the Con&s;traint they are oblig'd to Live in, being much Delighted to be Courted by others, as Per&s;ons of Merit; that &s;o they may make a better Hand of their Favours, or po&s;&s;ibly be|coming

<P>When a Young Woman goes privately from her Parents to yield her &s;elf up to the Lover, &s;he is e&s;teem'd very fortunate if the Gentle|man or Citizen that Debauch'd her, makes &s;ome &s;mall Provi&s;ion for her Maintenance. The whole con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome Poor Lodging that he Hires hung with Gilt Leather, a few Cloaths, and a &s;mall Weekly Allowance. This is the Fortune of the&s;e Young Women, who are yet Envy'd by all others of their Condition. From whence it happens that although one hears e|very Day of tho&s;e Rapes; yet being with the Con&s;ent of the Women, they are thought no ways Criminal, &s;o it is only call'd <HI>Menar via una puta:</HI> Such of the Young Wives as are not &s;a|tisfy'd with their Husbands, or that love their Diver&s;ions, are &s;ometimes &s;een to do the &s;ame thing.

<P>As this Libertini&s;m cannot be particular to the Nobility only, without infu&s;ing the Conta|gion into all other Conditions; &s;o it comes to pa&s;s, That all Citazens, Trade&s;men and Stran|gers have (in regard of their Plea&s;ures) full Liberty at <HI>Venice</HI> to do what they plea&s;e; yet they are to avoid all &s;uch Places which the <HI>Ve|netian</HI> Gentry re&s;erve to them&s;elves; for by do|ing otherwi&s;e they might chance to be made &s;en&s;ible of that Intru&s;ion: But the Nobles agree very well among them&s;elves as to the matter of Keeping, for if Two of them are not able to Maintain a Woman they like, which Society is term'd <HI>Farca&s;a,</HI> than each of them brings in his Friend to the Partner&s;hip, that &s;o they may render the Charge more ea&s;ie. I have known Three Gentlemen in Treaty about a Woman for a Year together, before they could &s;ettle the Conditions of the Bargain; yet what is more Ex|traordinary, one of the&s;e Nobles was Marry'd to a <HI>Gentledonna</HI> of one of the be&s;t Hou&s;es of
<PB N="52" REF="169">
<HI>Venice,</HI> and is likewi&s;e one of the Riche&s;t of all the new Created Hou&s;es: However he A&s;&s;oci|ated him&s;elf to the others, which looks as if he did expect to find tho&s;e Plea&s;ures more agreeable being divided than in particular.</P>
<P>Their whole Society u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e &s;orts of Extravgancies. They meet at the Cour|ti&s;ans, where they Divert them&s;elves by all manner of means; pretending, That by Living thus in Common, they have no rea&s;on to be jealous, and con&s;equently enjoy their Plea&s;ures with le&s;s inquietude: But as it is difficult for &s;uch a Licentious Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s to be con|tented with one &s;ort of Exce&s;s; &s;o it is not hard to believe tho&s;e who affirm, That the Courti&s;ans are employ'd to &s;uch Infamous u&s;es, that notwith&s;tanding all the Charms of En&s;na|ring by their extraordinary Laciviou&s;ne&s;s &s;uch as frequent them; yet it is impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;o much Lewdne&s;s mu&s;t create in mo&s;t the grea|te&s;t of Aver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Where there is &s;o much Di&s;order and &s;uch a general Corruption, it is not to be admir'd that the Di&s;temper which u&s;ually follows this Vice &s;hould be generally &s;pread; I do not &s;ay, only a|mong the Courti&s;ans, who are almo&s;t all infected with it, but likewi&s;e among the Marry'd Wo|men, of which number I mu&s;t le&s;s except the <HI>Gentledonna's</HI> than the Wives of the Common|alty: The rea&s;on of it is, the Young Nobility and the Marry'd Nobles being equally addicted to this exce&s;&s;ive Lewdne&s;s; &s;o they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;hare among them the Trouble which this Di&s;order produces. As the one makes no &s;cruple in communicating to their Ladies what they have
<PB N="53" REF="169">
acquir'd by their Ungenerous Proceedings, &s;o the others pay the Favours they receive from their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with Pre&s;ents of the &s;ame na|ture; whereby it happens this Corruption is, in a manner, here Univer&s;al.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily imagined from what has been &s;aid, That there is &s;carce a City in <HI>Europe,</HI> where this Di&s;temper is &s;o common. I am cer|tain by my own particular knowledge that &s;e|veral New-marry'd <HI>Gentledonna's</HI> mi&s;taking this Di&s;temper for Indi&s;po&s;itions u&s;ual to Women, have been reduc'd to a mo&s;t Deplorable Condi|tion without knowing what it was, until the virulency of the Illne&s;s, and the nature of the Remedies they took, did at length acquaint them with the truth of their Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The <HI>Republick</HI> does not think She ought to Rectify the&s;e Di&s;orders or &s;top the progre&s;s of &s;o much Libertini&s;m. But on the contrary She e&s;teems it for an Evil that is advantagious to the State, which like a Lethargy &s;tupifies the boil|ing Blood of their Youth; not only enervating the Vigour of them who&s;e Impetuous Natures might be dangerous, but it likewi&s;e empties the Pur&s;es of &s;uch Strangers, who come in great numbers to <HI>Venice</HI> for the love of Her La&s;civi|ous Plea&s;ures. Moreover the People being edu|cated in Softne&s;s, are not de&s;irous of any altera|tions in Government: So the Nobility being in|tirely addicted to the pur&s;uit of their Plea&s;ures, are not di&s;tru&s;ted of meditating Novelties that might be prejudicial to the State, but expect without impatience the Places and Dignities which Age and their Qualities Intitle them to in the <HI>Republick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="170">
As there is nothing more certain, That with|out the particular favour of the Almighty, the Vices of Youth follow Man to the Grave; &s;o it is no wonder if the mo&s;t Venerable Heads of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility do continue to ob&s;erve the &s;ame Habitude: They are &s;o little Circum|&s;pect in things of this nuture, and &s;o extremely open in the&s;e Practices; that the Husbands make no difficulty to &s;ay, they are to Dine with their Courti&s;ans that Day, and their Wives are to &s;end them what they order to be brought upon &s;uch occa&s;ions: I &s;hall rather leave it to be imagin'd than to expre&s;s here, tho&s;e Ba&s;e and and Extravagant Artifices that the&s;e Reverend Heads u&s;e as Incitements to tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, which the natural weakne&s;s of their Ages yet deprive them from ta&s;ting.</P>
<P>To conclude this Matter at the Place where I begun it, I &s;hall add, That the Condition of a particular Courti&s;an is &s;o little prejudicial to her Reputation who only Abandons her &s;elf to one Per&s;on, that if &s;uch a Young Woman re|tires from that Life, and Marries, &s;he is after|wards e&s;teemed free of all Reproach. In the&s;e Hopes &s;everal Young Caeatures deliver them|&s;elves to their Inclinations, but it is rare to &s;ee them retire; for their Lewdne&s;s join'd to that Liberty which they &s;o much e&s;teem, as being free from the Con&s;traint they were forc'd to un|der their Parents; are indi&s;&s;oluable Bonds, en|gaging them to a Profe&s;&s;ion that is actually Honoured by Daughters of Noble Families.</P>

<P>Nothing can be more &s;ingular, than to &s;ee in a manner all the City in Ma&s;querade, the Mo|thers carrying in their Arms their little Chil|dren in Di&s;gui&s;e: Such of both Sexes as go to the Market, or to the Haberda&s;hers for Six Pen|ny-worth of Tape, are &s;ure to be in Ma&s;que. The Place of Saint <HI>Mark</HI> is the great Theater, upon which is to be &s;een the chief Appearance of the <HI>Carnaval;</HI> for there is &s;carce a Ma&s;que in <HI>Venice</HI> that does not come here about an Hour before Sun-&s;et, in&s;omuch that the great Capaci|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Place is barely &s;ufficient to receive them and others that come to &s;ee them. The <HI>Gentledonna's</HI> do not only Di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves to partake of the Diver&s;ions in the la&s;t Days of the <HI>Carnaval;</HI> but &s;uch as have Intrigues do at this time by a Thou&s;and different ways deceive both Husband and Guards: For there is hardly any

or Hou&s;e which is not in a manner open to the Ma&s;ques; whereby this time of <HI>Carnaval</HI> &s;eems to be the Sea&s;on in which the Gallants get in the Harve&s;t of their Amours; for in this juncture are gather'd all the Fruits of tho&s;e Intrigues that have been in &s;u&s;pence during the other le&s;s favou|rable Sea&s;ons. New Corre&s;pondences are &s;ettled even with the Ladies mo&s;t narrowly watch'd, by taking the exacte&s;t and mo&s;t probable means for the long Continuance of them.</P>
<P>The length of the <HI>Carnaval</HI> which begins after <HI>Chri&s;t-ma&s;s</HI> Holy-Days, is one of the things that contribute mo&s;t to render it agreeable. 'Tis like|wi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what a Con&s;ternation there is throughout the whole City, e&s;pecially of &s;uch Per&s;ons that wait with impatience the va|rious Advantages of this Sea&s;on; when One of the Pre&s;idents of the Council of Ten, either through Capriciou&s;ne&s;s or po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome other Motives, forbids the u&s;e of Ma&s;querade or at lea&s;t re&s;trains the appearance of them to the la&s;t Days of <HI>Carnaval</HI> only. As this Order takes away the greate&s;t part of the Plea&s;ures of the Sea&s;on, &s;o it may be &s;aid, That it is very rare notwith&s;tanding the frequent threatnings to ac|compli&s;h the Execution of it; e&s;pecially if &s;ome Rea&s;on of State do not particularly oblige the Council to it.

<P>There are a great many Sconces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a Hall and &s;everal other Rooms of the &s;ame Floor, round which are plac'd a great many Ta|bles, to each of which there is a Noble who &s;its on that &s;ide next the Wall to keep the Banque: Before each of them there are Two Candles, &s;everal Packs of Cards, a Cup full of Gold-Pieces,
<PB N="59" REF="172">
and another of Silver-Ducats. In this manner they &s;it ready to receive all &s;uch as are willing to Play, either Ma&s;ques or <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen. The Crowd is &s;o great that very often one can hardly pa&s;s from out of one Room into another; neverthele&s;s the Silence here ob|&s;erv'd is much greater than that in the Churches: Strangers are much &s;urpriz'd at this Spectacle, which is infinitely more admirable for the Sin|gularity, then diverting in its Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The Game play'd here is <HI>Ba&s;&s;et</HI> only, which was unknown in <HI>France,</HI> until Signior <HI>Ju&s;ti|niani</HI> now Amba&s;&s;ador for that Republick very lately brought it into fa&s;hion at <HI>Paris:</HI> Since which it is become &s;o common as to need no De&s;cription here; it being only u&s;ed with this difference at <HI>Venice,</HI> that neither the Noble who deals, or the Ma&s;ques that Play do ever ex|change any Words with each other. The Young <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen commonly choo&s;e rather to Play, than to keep the Banque; but to &s;ee in how much Tranquillity and Gravity very Con|&s;iderable Summs are lo&s;t, is really &s;o very Ex|traordinary; that one would almo&s;t think this is a School, to learn the Art of behaving one's &s;elf with Moderation in the Alternatives of Fortune, rather than a Place of Diver&s;ion and Gaming,</P>
<P>A Noble Man very rarely continues to keep the Banque for a whole <HI>Carnaval,</HI> &s;o the Ta|bles are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively undertaken by different Gen|tlemen who are not all equally good Game&s;ters, for &s;ome lo&s;e and others get Con&s;iderably; but tho&s;e that love Play and are well acquainted with <HI>Venice,</HI> do generally know which are the

Nobles that have the Reputation of being the faire&s;t Game&s;ters: For however equal this Game &s;eems to be, yet there are &s;everal Gentlemen &s;o very dextrous in cutting and drawing the Cards, that the mo&s;t intelligent and quick-&s;ight|ed Player may be &s;ometimes deceiv'd.

<PB N="61" REF="173">
the <HI>French</HI> Language, which is almo&s;t natural to the <HI>Italian;</HI> and in reality, if it had not been for that able Ma&s;ter who fir&s;t undertook it, who was no le&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lully.</NOTE> Familiar with all the Beau|ties of the <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ick, than with tho&s;e De|licacies of the <HI>French,</HI> if it had not been I &s;ay for his great Experience, in making tho&s;e a|greeable Compo&s;itions which are &s;ung in two &s;uch different ways, it may be believed, that this Noble and Magnificent Diver&s;ion would not have been attended with that Succe&s;s which it has &s;ince had both at Court and in Town.</P>
<P>At <HI>Venice</HI> they Act in &s;everal Opera's at a time: The Theaters are Large and Stately, the Decora|tions Noble, and the Alterations of them good: But they are very badly Illuminared; the Ma|chines are &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;able and as often ridi|culous; the number of Actors is very great, they are all very well in Clothes; but their Actions are mo&s;t commonly di&s;agreeable. The&s;e Opera's are long, yet they would divert the Four Hours which they la&s;t, if they were compos'd by better Poets, that were a little more conver&s;ant with the Rules of the Theater<HI>:</HI> For in this matter their pre&s;ent Compo&s;itions are very deficient, in&s;o|much they are frequently not worth the Expence that is made upon them. The Ballets or Dan|cings between the Acts are generally &s;o pittiful, that they would be much better omitted; for one would imagine the&s;e Dancers wore Lead in their Shoes, yet the A&s;&s;embly be&s;tow their Applau&s;es on them, which is meerly for want of having &s;een better.</P>
<P>The Charms of their Voices do make amends
<PB N="62" REF="174">
for all imperfections: The&s;e Men without Beards have delicate Voices, be&s;ides which they are ad|mirably &s;uitable to the greatne&s;s of the Theater. They commonly have the be&s;t Women-Singers of all <HI>Italy,</HI> for to get a famous Girl from <HI>Rome</HI> or any other Place, they do not &s;cruple at giving Four or Five hundred Pi&s;toles with the Charges of the Journey, and yet their Opera's la&s;t no long|er than the <HI>Carnaval.</HI> Their Airs are langui&s;hing and touching; the whole compo&s;ition is mingl'd with agreeable Songs, that rai&s;e the Attention; the Symphony is mean in&s;piring rather Melan|choly than Gaiety: It is compos'd of Lutes, The|orbos and Harp&s;icords, yet they keep time to the Voices with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s imaginable.</P>
<P>If the <HI>French</HI> have at fir&s;t &s;ome difficulty to under&s;tand their Words, the <HI>Italians</HI> and all o|ther Strangers have much more trouble in <HI>France;</HI> where they do not only Sing lower, but pro|nounce their Words with much le&s;s di&s;tinction. The great <HI>Chorus</HI> of Mu&s;ick that &s;o often fills the <HI>French</HI> Theater, of which one indeed can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h the Words, is very di&s;agree|able to the <HI>Italians,</HI> who &s;ay, That this is much more proper to the Church than the Stage, as likewi&s;e that the great number of Violins &s;poils the Symphony of the other Mu&s;ick, which they think can be only agreeable to the <HI>French,</HI> unle&s;s it is when they play alone in other Occa&s;ions. Although they allow the <HI>French</HI> to &s;ucceed very well in their Dances, yet they are of the Opinion, that there are too many of them in their Opera's; who&s;e Compo&s;itions are likewi&s;e too &s;hort for their Fancies, which they think are not &s;ufficiently fill'd with Intrigues. Their
<PB N="63" REF="174">
Compo&s;itions are always concluded with the Character of an Old Woman that gives good Advice to the Young, but falling in Love her &s;elf without any probability of a return, &s;he runs into the repetition of a great many plea&s;ant Fancies.</P>
<P>They that compo&s;e the Mu&s;ick of the Opera, endeavour to conclude the Scenes of the Princi|pal Actors with Airs that Charm and Elevate, that &s;o they may acquire the Applau&s;e of the Audience, which &s;ucceeds &s;o well to their inten|tions, that one hears nothing but a Thou&s;and <HI>Beni&s;&s;imo</HI>'s together; yet nothing is &s;o remarka|ble as the plea&s;ant Benedictions and the Ridicu|lous Wi&s;hes of the <HI>Gondoliers</HI> in the Pit to the Women-Singers, who cry aloud to them, <HI>Sias tu benedetta, benedetto el padre che te genero.</HI> But the&s;e Acclamations are not always within the bounds of Mode&s;ty, for tho&s;e impudent Fellows &s;ay whatever they plea&s;e; as being a&s;|&s;ur'd to make the A&s;&s;embly rather Laugh than Angry.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen have &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o Tran&s;ported and out of all bounds by the charm|ing Voices of the&s;e Girls, as to bend them&s;elves out of their Boxes, crying, <HI>Ah cara! mi Butto, mi Butto,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing after this manner the Ra|ptures of Plea&s;ure which the&s;e divine Voices cau&s;e to them. I need not omit the Prie&s;ts in this Place, for according to the Example of <HI>Rome,</HI> they are no ways &s;crupulous of appearing upon the Stage in all manner of Parts, and by acquiring the Character of a good Actor they commonly get that of an hone&s;t Man. I re|member once, that one of the Spectators di&s;|cerning
<PB N="64" REF="175">
a Prie&s;t in the Di&s;gui&s;e of an Old Wo|man, cry'd aloud, <HI>ecco Pre Pierro, che fa'la vecchia.</HI> Neverthele&s;s all things pa&s;s with more decency at the Opera than at the Comedy, as being mo&s;t commonly frequented by the better &s;ort of People. One pays Four Livers at the Door, and Two more for a Chair in the Pitt, which amounts to Three Shillings and Six-Pence <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> without reckoning the Opera-Book and the Wax-Candle, every one buys; for without them even tho&s;e of the Country would hardly comprehend any thing of the Hi&s;tory, or the &s;ubject matter of the Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gentledonna</HI>'s frequent the Opera much more than the Comedy, by rea&s;on the Diver&s;i|ons of that place are expre&s;s'd with more Civi|lity than tho&s;e of the other: As they are at this time allowed to dre&s;s with their Jewels, &s;o they appear mo&s;t &s;plendidly by the means of the many lighted Tapers which are in tho&s;e Boxes. Here their Lovers are employed in the Contem|plation of their Charms, and they on their &s;ide, &s;hew by &s;ome Signs that they are pleas'd with the a&s;&s;iduity of their Services: Whenever a new Girl appears to Sing at the Opera, the principal Nobles e&s;teem it a point of Honour to be Ma|&s;ter of her, and if &s;he Sings well they &s;pare no|thing that may accompli&s;h the De&s;ign of getting her. One of the <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s was upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions Rival to the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> they both endeavour'd to exceed each other in their Pre&s;ents, yet the Charms of her Voice were not accompanied with all tho&s;e of Beauty: The <HI>Venetian</HI> was &s;ucce&s;sful and got the better of the Duke.</P>

<P>THE Comedy is only at <HI>Venice</HI> in <HI>Carnaval-time;</HI> however, it &s;ometimes begins in the end of <HI>October</HI> or beginning of <HI>November,</HI> in which Month one frequently finds here three &s;e|veral Gangs of <HI>Comedians,</HI> each infinitely wor&s;e than the other. The Theaters in which they Act, belong to the Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> as like|wi&s;e tho&s;e of the <HI>Opera's,</HI> from whence they receive very con&s;iderable Profits; for they let their Boxes at &s;uch a certain Price for the whole <HI>Car|naval,</HI> or el&s;e &s;o much a Day. The Profit of the Actors is only what they receive at the Door, which do's not exceed five Pence each Head. The greate&s;t part of the Audience commonly choo&s;e the conveniency of being in Ma&s;querade both at the <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Opera.</HI> Their Dre&s;s is u&s;ual|ly a Champain-Coat or riding Cloak, a &s;ort of a Bonnet of a black Taffata upon their Heads, which only permits the &s;ight of their No&s;e and Eyes; over this &s;ome add a half Vizour neatly made, and cover'd with fine glaz'd Linnen: Tho&s;e that wear the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ve&s;t with this Di&s;gui&s;e are look'd upon for real Nobles, yet the Nobili|ty are rarely in Ma&s;ques, either at the <HI>Opera</HI> or <HI>Comedy;</HI> unle&s;s they are tho&s;e that dare not ap|proach their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, nor enjoy the &s;atisfaction of &s;uch mutual regards, without creating to the

Ladies, both trouble&s;ome dangerous Affairs.</P>
<P>The young Nobility do not go &s;o much to the Comedy to laugh at the Buffoonry of the Actors, as to play their own ridiculous Parts: They commonly bring Courte&s;ans with them to their Boxes, where there is &s;uch a confu&s;ion and &s;ometimes &s;uch &s;urprizing Accidents, &s;o contrary to the Rules of Decency, which are at lea&s;t due in all Publick Places, that one mu&s;t indeed &s;ee the&s;e Tran&s;actions before he can believe them. One of their mo&s;t ordinary Diver&s;ions is not only to &s;pit in the Pit, but likewi&s;e to pelt them with Snuffs and ends of Candles, and if they perceive any one decently clad, or with a Feather in his Hat, they are &s;ure to ply him with the be&s;t of their en|deavours, which they may do as being free from all notice or puni&s;hment; for the Nobles that are the Protectors of the Theater, have their Bravo's in di&s;gui&s;e at the Doors, who are well armed, and ready to obey Orders: Be&s;ides the <HI>Comedy</HI> and <HI>Opera</HI> are look'd upon as Privilege-places, where the lea&s;t Violence would be reckon'd a Crime of State.</P>
<P>The liberty which they in the Pit take, accor|ding to the Example of the Nobility, do's finally rai&s;e the Confu&s;ion to its utmo&s;t height. The <HI>Gondoliers</HI> chiefly do give their impertinent Ap|plau&s;es to &s;ome certain Actions of the Buffoons, that would be tolerated in no other Place; nei|ther is it &s;eldom that the whole Hou&s;e makes &s;uch terrible Exclamations again&s;t the Actors, who are not &s;o happy as to plea&s;e, that they are forced to retire to be &s;ucceeded by others; for the continual cry is, <HI>fuora buffoni.</HI> The Gentlemen find this &s;o agreeable to 'em, that even they them|&s;elves
<PB N="67" REF="176">
are frequently this hi&s;&s;ing Party; and if one inquires how it comes to pa&s;s, That they are &s;o very prudent and wi&s;e at the great <HI>Ridotti</HI> where they Game, and &s;o extravagantly fooli&s;h at the <HI>Co|medy;</HI> you are an&s;wered, That they &s;it at the for|mer Place to take the hazards of Fortune, but that they come hither to divert them&s;elves only; and as Ma&s;ters, they are pleas'd to do it accor|ding to the method mo&s;t agreeable to them.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the Noi&s;e which is made when a Play has given &s;atisfaction to the A&s;&s;em|bly, or to &s;peak more properly to the <HI>Gondoliers;</HI> for when they come to name the Play to be Acted the next Day, that Mob cries out <HI>que&s;ta, que&s;ta,</HI> play the &s;ame again, which mu&s;t be of cour&s;e o|bey'd. Whereby one u&s;ually brings away from the&s;e pitiful <HI>Comedies,</HI> the di&s;&s;atisfaction only of having delay'd Supper until nine or ten at Night; yet they &s;ometimes act &s;uch as are very &s;erious. Their Compo&s;itions are in Ver&s;e, and the&s;e they call <HI>Opera's,</HI> with which they have indifferent good Succe&s;s. At other times they repre&s;ent &s;uch as would not be tolerated by the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> any where out of the Territories of the State of <HI>Ve|nice;</HI> as that of <HI>Don Giles,</HI> who in the Habit of a <HI>Religious,</HI> preaches again&s;t the Debauchery to which he abandons him&s;elf: Yet it is no ways &s;trange that the&s;e things pa&s;s unregarded, &s;eeing the Nobles &s;uffer them&s;elves to be ridicul'd up|on the Stage, in the Per&s;on of <HI>Pantalon,</HI> who is a real Copy of them, in Habits, Actions, and Words, which he really imitates with the great|e&s;t exactne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the little Balls or tho&s;e called Fea&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>THere are a great many of the&s;e little Balls, during the <HI>Carnaval</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> which they call Fea&s;ts, according to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Rome;</HI> excepting that at <HI>Venice</HI> the Dancers pay the Mu&s;icians: As the Fea&s;ts occa&s;ion a great Liberty and great Profits to tho&s;e that make them, &s;o it happens that they are either intirely forbidden, or el&s;e &s;uch as would have them mu&s;t have a Permi&s;&s;ion from the Magi&s;trate. Upon which a Hou&s;e is fitted up to this purpo&s;e, a Lanthorn deck't with Garlands is &s;et as the Sign at the Door, where it continues the whole <HI>Carnaval.</HI> A Violin with a pair of Virginals is the Mu&s;ick of the Place, which is open to all &s;orts of People. Their Dancers are u&s;ually of two &s;orts, &s;ome|times according to the <HI>French</HI> way of Dancing, and &s;ometimes a Figure-Dance, or &s;ort of a Brawl, which the little Girls of <HI>Venice</HI> perform to admiration.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e is always pre&s;ent to gather in his Profit, to which purpo&s;e the In&s;tru|ments forbear playing, &s;o &s;oon as the Company has danc'd four or five Rounds, or a <HI>Four lane;</HI> for &s;o they call this &s;ort of Brawl. The Dancers are thus to pay their Acknowledgments, which is about a half-penny <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the Women and Girls that go to the&s;e Fea&s;ts are always in Ma&s;ques, and as they are generally either Cour|te&s;ans or Women of good Qualifications; &s;o the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> take the ample&s;t Liberties of
<PB N="69" REF="177">
the&s;e Diver&s;ions, by endeavouring to pa&s;s the Hours plea&s;antly with the hand&s;ome Ma&s;ques that are &s;ometime there, not much regarding the trouble they give tho&s;e that brought them thi|ther.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e do's accommodate them with convenient Rooms, as are de&s;irous to eat and drink, where it is not to be doubted but things of farther moment are &s;ometimes tran&s;|acted, all which little matters do amount at la&s;t to a con&s;iderable Profit. Therefore this was us'd to be formerly a particular Privilege belonging to the Servants of Amba&s;&s;adors, who kept tho&s;e &s;ort of Mu&s;ick-Hou&s;es within the Limits of their Ma&s;ters Juri&s;dictions<HI>:</HI> But this &s;hameful Com|merce appear'd &s;o &s;ordid to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France,</HI> that they fir&s;t forbid the u&s;e of it to their Servants, &s;ince which the Example has been follow'd by all others. The Nobles and <HI>Citadins</HI> have oftentimes tho&s;e Balls that la&s;t only one Night, to which every Man comes with his Courte&s;an Ma&s;qu'd; yet only tho&s;e Per&s;ons that are known are permitted to enter, as it is often|times practis'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> where tho&s;e that fre|quent the&s;e &s;ort of Night-Dances, are wrapt up in their Cloaks, the long Sword under their Arm, and a dark Lanthorn in their Hand.</P>

<P>THESE Exerci&s;es of <HI>Hercules</HI> and the Bull-Fea&s;ts, are Sports that are Repre&s;ented in the &s;everal Sea&s;ons of the Year; but &s;eeing the <HI>Carnaval</HI> is the chief time for Plea&s;ure and

Sights, &s;o they then endeavour to perform their principal Feats of Activity in the&s;e matters. The common People are much delighted with the two la&s;t, by rea&s;on they are of that Body who &s;hew them to the Publick, but more e&s;peci|ally the Exerci&s;es of <HI>Hercules,</HI> which are per|form'd by certain Companies of Arti&s;ans and Boat-Men, who continually Exerci&s;e them&s;elves for it: To which purpo&s;e there appears about twenty young Men, upon a great Scaffold rais'd in &s;ome publick Place, all of them being clad in clo&s;e &s;traight Breeches, and little Wa&s;tcoats of <HI>Brocatelle;</HI> to their Garters are fa&s;tned &s;ome &s;mall gingling Bells.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing they &s;hew when they mount the Scaffold by an ea&s;y A&s;cent, is one of their mo&s;t agreeable Actions. Each of them carries one of his Companions upon their Shoulders, in a manner very particular; for they that are car|ried have only their right Foot upon the Shoul|der of him that &s;upports them: They incline their Bodies forward, by leaning altogether on the right &s;ide; their Arms are &s;tretch'd out, the one up and the other down; in which manner they fol|low each other, each of them holding the Heel of the left Leg which he &s;tretches out that is carried before them; &s;o they &s;eem to be along Chain of Men in the Air, who only &s;upport them&s;elves by their Hands and the ends of their Feet.</P>
<P>They afterwards ob&s;erve a &s;ort of Cadence to their Bells, by making of &s;everal Rounds, as like|wi&s;e at Intervals &s;everal Figures, which in their mo|tions and po&s;tures are quite different from each other. Sometimes four underneath, having upon their Shoulders the ends of two Poles, carry eight
<PB N="71" REF="178">
up an end to the height of five Men, by including a little Boy, that is over upon the Shoulders of the uppermo&s;t: Sometimes four of the &s;tronge&s;t form an Arch of Bodies, with their Stomacks out|wards, and &s;o &s;u&s;tain &s;ix or &s;even Men upon the tran&s;ver&s;e of their Bellies. Others having two Men one above the other, upon the Shoul|ders, walk about, &s;it them down and ri&s;e with this heavy and tottering Burden. In &s;hort, up|on having repre&s;ented &s;everal &s;trange Figures, by as many different Po&s;tures, which do not require a le&s;s &s;hare of Agility than a mo&s;t prodigious Strength of Body; they conclude the&s;e Diver&s;i|ons, that are much to the &s;atisfaction of the Spectators, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of the People, who like the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> only de&s;ire Bread and fine Shews.</P>
<P>The People do not flock in le&s;s Crowds to the Bull-Fea&s;ts, than to the <HI>Herculean</HI> Agilities. To which purpo&s;e they &s;ometimes erect &s;everal Scaf|folds round a great Square, or as often a Rail on|ly, for their Bulls are not of the more furious &s;orts. Two Men commonly hold them by their Horns with two long Ropes: After this, they loo&s;e their Dogs which fa&s;ten with &s;o much fury upon their Ears or their Throats, that they would both lo&s;e their Breath and choak them&s;elves; if they were not &s;ometimes dextrou&s;ly drawn off. This Diver&s;ion would be very incon&s;iderable, if it were not for the plea&s;ant Di&s;orders that &s;ome|times happen by the Bull's breaking loo&s;e from them that have hold of the Ropes; for finding him|&s;elf violently pinch'd by the Dogs, he makes u&s;e of his utmo&s;t force, over-turns &s;ome of the Scaf|folds,

<P>In the &s;ame Places they &s;ometimes entertain the Company with the Diver&s;ion of Bear-Baiting, which &s;ort of Creatures are particularly kept for the diver&s;ions of the People: Not long &s;ince a Bear being &s;everely us'd by the Dogs, made a greater effort than could be imagin'd from &s;uch a Creature, broke loo&s;e from his Stake, and leap'd upon a Scaffold, which caus'd &s;o great a Di&s;or|der, that &s;everal of the Spectators were dange|rou&s;ly wounded. They &s;ometimes turn the Bulls through the Streets, but particularly in the <HI>Car|naval-time;</HI> which is not only to render the Fle&s;h better, but likewi&s;e for the Diver&s;ion of the young Nobles, who putting back their Ve&s;ts take hold of the Ropes, and run after them, guiding through the Streets tho&s;e poor Creatures to be torn by the Dogs; the narrowne&s;s whereof do's &s;ometimes occa&s;ion the greate&s;t difficulties to Pa&s;&s;engers, that meet them at the end of a Turn|ing, or are otherwi&s;e unexpectedly met by a Bull enrag'd with the Dogs.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the Ceremony upon</HI> Maundy-Thur&s;day.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MAundy Thur&s;day</HI> is a Day of Publick Re|joycing, by rea&s;on of the Ceremony <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jeudigras.</NOTE> which is at this time perform'd upon the Place of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Seignory,</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;adors of Princes. This great publick Fe&s;tival con&s;i&s;ts in &s;eeing the Head of a Bull cut off, after which they have the Diver&s;ion of an ar|tificial Fire-work, which is but very indifferent; yet what makes it wor&s;e, is, its being performed by Day-light. Then come the Rope-Dancers and
<PB N="73" REF="180">
Vaulters who &s;how their Agilities upon a Scaffold erected upon the Place over again&s;t the Gallery of the Palace in which the <HI>Seignory</HI> is &s;eated.</P>
<P>This Fe&s;tival derives its Original from the happy Succe&s;s with which the Arms of the <HI>Repu|blick</HI> were attended, in the Wars &s;he formerly had again&s;t <HI>Ulric</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Aquilea,</HI> in behalf of the Patriarch of <HI>Grado:</HI> For the irreconcila|ble Hatred of the former having &s;everal times en|gag'd him to take up Arms again&s;t his Competi|tor; the <HI>Republick</HI> had as often recour&s;e to their Arms, in defence of the la&s;t, who was not &s;o pow|erful; and having at length taken that Patriarch Pri&s;oner, as he de&s;ign'd to have &s;ecured him&s;elf of <HI>Grado,</HI> which he unexpectedly attack'd, he was with twelve Canons, Pri&s;oners with him, con|demn'd to have his Head cut off upon the Place of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> but the <HI>Republick,</HI> as it was thought, left him to expire between two Walls. In his &s;tead they cut off the Head of a Bull, and twelve Hogs in tho&s;e of the twelve Canons.</P>
<P>To perpetuate the Memory of this Advantage of the <HI>Republick,</HI> who has ever been very care|ful in pre&s;erving the Memory of all her Victo|ties; She Solemnizes every Year the Fe&s;tival of <HI>Maundy-Thur&s;day,</HI> who&s;e Preparations and Pomp do very much re&s;emble &s;ome ridiculous Tragedies. All the <HI>Butchers</HI> of the City dre&s;s them&s;elves very &s;trangely, with all the fine things they are able to borrow, they afterwards appear at the Place of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> divided into &s;everal Companies; but as they are every one of them arm'd with what they think fit, &s;o it is the mo&s;t extravagant Sight imaginable, to &s;ee &s;ome with old Halbards, others with great Scymiters, &s;ome

with Pikes, and others with old fa&s;hion'd Spadons, which they carry naked between both their Hands.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Seignory</HI> comes down into a great Room, that is even with the Galleries of the fir&s;t Floor of the Palace; this plea&s;ant Militia pa&s;&s;es in a Re-view before the <HI>Doge</HI> and the Am|ba&s;&s;adors. The variety of their Arms and Habits join'd to the Irregularity of their March, occa&s;i|ons a Sight the mo&s;t extraordinary in its nature that I ever yet beheld: For &s;ome run, others march gravely; &s;ome make their mo&s;t profound Reverences to the <HI>Seignory;</HI> and others &s;trutting by without taking notice of them. All this is perform'd with the Sounding of Trumpets that run a Foot at the Head of each Company; in &s;hort, this whole Ceremony re&s;embles more &s;ome Popular Emotion, than any Publick Rejoicing.</P>
<P>From hence they pa&s;s to the <HI>Piazza,</HI> that go's out upon the Place, where they are no &s;ooner arriv'd, but he of the <HI>Butchers</HI> to whom the Ho|nour of the Execution is de&s;ign'd, with one flou|ri&s;h of his Sword &s;trikes off the Head of the Bull, in pre&s;ence of almo&s;t the whole City; the Place, the Palace, the Procuratories, and &s;eve|ral Scaffolds erected on this occa&s;ion, being all full with an infinite number of People, that come hither to &s;ee the Ceremony, as likewi&s;e to partake of the Diver&s;ions that attend it, of which the Fire-works at two in the Afternoon &s;eem the mo&s;t &s;ingular.

<P>SUCH as have been delighted in ob&s;erving the &s;ingular and agreeable Manner of the u&s;ual Dances of the young Women, will not think it &s;trange to &s;ee this reckon'd here, in the Number of the Publick Diver&s;ions, which in it &s;elf appears &s;o common.

Upon all <HI>Holy-days,</HI> the Daughters of the Com|mon People a&s;&s;emble in the mo&s;t &s;pacious Places of the Streets or Keys, but mo&s;t common|ly in the little Squares of their Quarters.

<P>They are very neatly dre&s;s'd, in a Garb not much differing from Ours: They u&s;ually have for the&s;e Occa&s;ions, a coloured Silk or <HI>Brocatelle-pair</HI> of Bodice, without Sleeves, a Serge-Petti|coat bound about with a &s;mall Galoon, and a

Pair of curious white Shoes; the Sleeves of their Shifts are of an extraordinary fine white Linnen, the&s;e are &s;et full and ruffl'd upon the Shoulders; which is no ways le&s;s becoming to 'em, than the Flowers they fa&s;ten to the Tre&s;&s;es of their Hair, that fall about their Ears. The famous Dancers have commonly a Taffata-Petti|coat, little Leather-Pumps, lac'd with a &s;mall Silver-Lace, and the Soles extremely thin: In this manner they are mo&s;t commonly dre&s;s'd, in which they dance to Admiration. Be&s;ides their Activi|ty and exactne&s;s of Time, is no ways le&s;s &s;ur|prizing, than the Exerci&s;e is agreeable to the Be|holders.</P>
<P>Their Mu&s;ick is a <HI>Tabor,</HI> which is accompa|nied with the Voice of the Per&s;on that beats up|on it; the Tune is always the &s;ame: Sometimes two Girls Dance the <HI>Four lane</HI> together, and &s;ometimes a Boy and a Girl, who &s;tanding for a little while oppo&s;ite to each other, move their Feet forwards; making all their little Steps with &s;o much ea&s;e and &s;wiftne&s;s, that although they never have both Feet down at a time; yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h which of the two is either up or down. Afterwards, they ca&s;t off on both &s;ides, and then turn round contrary to each other; but &s;o even, and with &s;o much Swift|ne&s;s, that when the Girl plea&s;es, &s;he overthrows the Boy that Dances with her, by only holding her Elbow &s;tiff at the time they pa&s;s by one another; this is always taken for a particular Favour, as likewi&s;e for a great Mark of Addre&s;s in the Girl.</P>

<P>About the Year 1175. Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the III. being violently Per&s;ecuted by the Emperor <HI>Fre|derick</HI> the II. who had &s;et up another, with the help of the Cardinals of his Faction, retir'd pri|vately to <HI>Venice;</HI> where, after he had liv'd &s;ome time conceal'd, in a Hou&s;e of the Canons Regu|lar: He was at length di&s;cover'd, although in the Habit of a mean Servant. Upon which, the <HI>Doge, Seba&s;tian Ziani,</HI> went in Ceremony to re|ceive his Holine&s;s, who was thereupon brought to the Palace, where he receiv'd all the Honours that were due to his Dignity. The Emperor was no &s;ooner inform'd of this Pa&s;&s;age, but he &s;ent to acquaint the <HI>Venetians,</HI> That if they did not abandon this pretended Pope, that they mu&s;t expect to &s;ee the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles &s;uddenly flying in the Place of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> And to accompli&s;h the Menace, he &s;ent his Son <HI>Otho</HI> to <HI>Venice</HI> with a mighty Naval Force: But the Generous <HI>Doge,</HI> to whom Heaven &s;eems to have re&s;erv'd the Glory of the Greate&s;t Actions, that are to be found in the <HI>Annals</HI> of this <HI>Republick,</HI> immedi|ately

<P>An Advantage of this Importance fill'd the whole <HI>Republick</HI> with Joy. The Pope went to receive the Victorious <HI>Doge,</HI> at the Entrance of the <HI>Lido,</HI> and having Embrac'd him, he pre&s;ented him with a Ring from his Finger, telling him, <Q>That a Sea, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ut omnis Po&s;teritas in|telligat Ma|ris po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io|nem Victoriae jure ve&s;tram fui&s;&s;e.</NOTE> upon which the <HI>Venetians</HI> were &s;o powerful, ought to be &s;o &s;ubject to them as the Wife is to the Husband.</Q> However, the Pope not being then able to acknowledge this &s;ignal Service of the <HI>Republick;</HI> he pre|&s;ented the <HI>Doge</HI> with the Right of u&s;ing the <HI>Ombrello,</HI> the Cu&s;hi|on, and the Golden Chair, the Taper and the Candle&s;tick, that are carried before him, upon particular Days, with the &s;ame Solemnity as they are before the Pope: He likewi&s;e pre&s;ented him with the Silver-Trompets, and the above-menti|ned Standards, which do at pre&s;ent compo&s;e all the External Pomp of the <HI>Dogal</HI> Dignity.</P>
<P><HI>Otho</HI> was Releas'd upon his <HI>Parole,</HI> which he gave them to return again, in ca&s;e he could not engage his Father to make an Honourable Peace; but he return'd with the Emperor, who found Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> in the Pontifical Garments, up|on the Steps of the Church of St. <HI>Mark;</HI> and as the Emperor &s;toop'd to ki&s;s his Feet, the Pope is &s;aid to have put one of them upon his Neck, re|peating this Ver&s;e, <HI>Super a&s;pidem &amp; Ba&s;ili&s;cum ambulabis.</HI> To which the Emperor reply'd, <HI>Non tibi &s;ed Petro;</HI> and the Pope made An&s;wer, <HI>Et</HI>

<P>Some Circum&s;tances of this Account may be que&s;tion'd; but there is no po&s;&s;ibility of doubt|ing of the Protection which <HI>Venice</HI> afforded to this Sovereign Pontiff, per&s;ecuted by <HI>Frederick</HI> the II.

<P><HI>AScen&s;ion-Day</HI> is not only one of tho&s;e Fe&s;ti|vals upon which the <HI>Doge</HI> Entertains the Amba&s;&s;adors, the <HI>Seignory</HI> and the <HI>Senators</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the Function; but it is likewi&s;e that which is perform'd with &s;o much more Magnificence, as the Ceremony of the Solemnity upon this Oc|ca&s;ion, is infinitely more con&s;iderable than the others. The&s;e Fea&s;ts are made in a Hall of the Palace, that is on the &s;ide of the <HI>Doge</HI>'s Ap|partments. At the bottom of this Hall there is a rais'd <HI>E&s;trade,</HI> of about half a Foot high, upon which is plac'd a Demi-Circular Table, that takes up all the breadth of the Hall, except|ing the nece&s;&s;ary Spaces at the end of the two Angles. The <HI>Doge</HI> takes his Place in the middle, between the <HI>Nuncio</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> the &s;ix Councellors of the <HI>Seignory,</HI> and the three Pre&s;idents of the Criminal of Forty, are on the Right and Left; five on one &s;ide and four on the other. The&s;e Per&s;ons take up the Places of this Table, which looks upon &s;ix other very large ones, that are down the two &s;ides of the Hall; at which &s;it in order, on each &s;ide of them, they who&s;e Dignities Entitle them to the fir&s;t Places at the&s;e Publick Ceremonies. Then the <HI>Seignory,</HI> and after them all the <HI>Senators</HI> take their Pla|ces,
<PB N="92" REF="190">
according to the Seniority of their Stand|ing.</P>
<P>The Tables are before Dinner covered with a Service that remains there the whole time of the Entertainment. Every Body goes to &s;ee the Preparations of the Fea&s;t; there being upon each Table, Trophies, Great Figures, Triumphal Ar|ches, and Ca&s;tles of white Wax Gilt; as al&s;o an infinite number of &s;mall Di&s;hes of Fruit, Roots, dried Sweet-Meats, Tongues, prepar'd Sau|&s;ages, Counterfeit Phea&s;ant-Pies, other Birds in Feathers, and other &s;uch like things, that are never open'd. The u&s;ual Cu&s;tom is to have twelve Services by two Di&s;hes at a time to each Table, excepting that of the <HI>Doge,</HI> to which is brought three, that is, one Di&s;h at each end of the Table for the Councellors, and a third for the <HI>Doge,</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;adors, which is pla|ced upon a &s;mall Table in the middle of the Hall, a little di&s;tant from that where his Serenity &s;its.</P>
<P>Upon Fle&s;h-Days they intermix the Services, as one of Fle&s;h and the next Fi&s;h; to which there are &s;o many Carvers as there are Di&s;hes &s;erv'd up to the Table; but he that Carves for the <HI>Doge,</HI> by one of his Squires, the Portions he cuts in a cover'd Plate; that &s;o there may be a di&s;tinction between his Serenity and the Amba&s;&s;adors, to whom the &s;ame <HI>Ecuyer</HI> pre&s;ents them uncover'd. The <HI>Doge</HI> do's ever pre&s;ent the fir&s;t Plate of the fir&s;t Service to the Nuncio of the Pope, and the &s;econd to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> honouring in their Per&s;ons the Princes they Repre&s;ent. The Carvers at the other Tables do take care not to help the Senators, until &s;uch time as the <HI>Doge</HI> and the Mini&s;ters are Serv'd. At the Entrance of
<PB N="93" REF="190">
every one of the Services, the Haut-Boys Play a Tune, and at the Serving up of the Fruit, the Trophies and other Intermi&s;&s;es are taken away, to make Room for the other Di&s;hes of Fruit; among which there is always good &s;tore of Roots and Pul&s;e, to wit Pea&s;e and Beans in Garlick, and other Rarities of the Sea&s;on; as, Beans up|on St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Day, Figgs and Rasberies upon <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> Day; but of all things there is never no want of Sweet-Fennel.</P>
<P>After the Cloath is taken away at the end of the Dinner, every one is &s;erv'd with a Wicker-Di&s;h, covered with Cut Paper, in which are cer|tain Pa&s;ties of Pi&s;tachio's and Pine-Apples, as al|&s;o &s;ome Papers of Sugar-Plums, and dri'd Com|fits. This is the Pre&s;ent which the <HI>Doge</HI> makes to the Gue&s;ts to carry home with 'em. The Nuncio and Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> never mi&s;s doing the &s;ame. However, the Entertainment upon <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-Day,</HI> is not &s;o &s;erious as the three others, that are upon the Days of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and St. <HI>Vido;</HI> upon which was Di&s;|cover'd the Con&s;piracy of <HI>Bayamonte Tiepolo;</HI> by rea&s;on the Junior <HI>Pregadi,</HI> or the young No|bility a&s;&s;i&s;ting at this Ceremony, make &s;uch a Noi&s;e and Confu&s;ion, during the Dinner; even to forget, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the Re&s;pect which is due to the <HI>Doge,</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;adors; not being a&s;ham'd to pelt each other with Oranges, cro&s;s the Hall; as likewi&s;e to make the Windows clatter with tho&s;e Salvo's of Sugar-Plums, which every Table gives to each other, at the end of the Dinner.</P>
<P>The Old Senators, the Councellors, and the <HI>Doge,</HI> are much delighted with this Gayety of
<PB N="94" REF="191">
the young Nobles, or at lea&s;t &s;eem to be &s;o in ap|pearance, as not daring to check 'em upon the ac|count of their Behaviour. They may &s;ometimes endeavour to excu&s;e 'em, when there are tho&s;e Per&s;ons pre&s;ent, who might happen to be &s;canda|liz'd at &s;o much liberty, at which time they palli|ate the Matter, <HI>la no&s;tra giuventa &s;ta allegramente.</HI> After Dinner, when all is taken away, and every one &s;erv'd with his Di&s;h of Comfits, the Ser|vants of the Nuncio and the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> carry away the Services of the little Side-Board-Tables, which were cover'd behind their Ma&s;ters, where they had all &s;orts of Wine they are u&s;ed to drink; le&s;t the alteration of them might any ways prove prejudicial to their Healths. In the mean time &s;everal of the mo&s;t Famous Mu&s;icians are brought in, who entertain the A&s;|&s;embly, with all the New Opera-Songs, which are accompanied with a Con&s;ort of Violins, a Harp&s;i|cord, a Theorbo and a Tabour. No one &s;tirs from his Place, until &s;uch time as the Doors of the Palace and the Hall are open'd to let in the Foot-Men, that come to receive their Ma&s;ters Services of Confits, which they carry to their <HI>Gondolos.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the late <HI>Doge Contarini,</HI> they had much rea&s;on to be weary of this Entertain|ment of the Mu&s;ick: For they were then not us'd to open the Doors of the Palace, until &s;uch time as they had got up all the Plate that was em|ploy'd at the Fea&s;t. This Cu&s;tom was fir&s;t in|troduc'd through the extreme Covetou&s;ne&s;s of the Procurator <HI>Contarini,</HI> Son of that <HI>Doge,</HI> who made no difficulty to go about the Hall in a Mask, to &s;ee that none of the Plate might be dimini&s;h'd, which was brought from the Tables.
<PB N="95" REF="191">
Once he detain'd the Company above an Hour more than u&s;ual, whom he endeavour'd to divert with &s;everal tedious Songs, until &s;uch time as he had found a Silver-Plate that was mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>To conclude this Fea&s;t upon <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> with more than u&s;ual Rejoycings; they go in the Eve|ning to enjoy the <HI>Fre&s;que</HI> upon the Canal of <HI>Mu|rano,</HI> where all the Balconies and Windows are full of the be&s;t &s;ort of People of <HI>Venice.</HI> As the Ceremony in the Forenoon, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of it, was one half compos'd of Peo|ple in Ma&s;ques; &s;o one &s;ees at the <HI>Fre&s;que</HI> of <HI>Murano,</HI> what&s;oever was mo&s;t Gallant at the Nuptials of the Sea; as, abundance of Boats with Trumpets, and very finely Equipp'd, and a great many Strangers in pretty Barques, as al&s;o the Courte&s;ans, who appear here in Ma&s;ques, but very neatly dre&s;s'd in white, and their <HI>Gon|dolo's</HI> cover'd with Ro&s;es. All the&s;e added to the u&s;ual concour&s;e of Ladies and Gentlemen, compo&s;e this agreeable Diver&s;ity of the <HI>Fre&s;que</HI> of <HI>Murano.</HI></P>
<P>This Ceremony on the <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> is yet more famous, by rea&s;on of the Fair that is at this time held upon the Place of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> for fif|teen days. That Spot of Ground is quite fill'd with Shops, which are di&s;pos'd in Rows and co|ver'd with Tents. As the Ma&s;ques are com|monly permitted for the&s;e fifteen Days, unle&s;s forbidden upon &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion; &s;o you are certain in that time, to find them here in abundance. The Ladies likewi&s;e, and all the bet|ter &s;ort of People never mi&s;s being there in the Evenings. All the Diver&s;ions and Rarities of <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> as Rope-Dancers, Vaulters, Wild Bea&s;ts, Mon|&s;ters,
<PB N="96" REF="192">
with an infinity of &s;uch &s;orts of things are then at <HI>Venice;</HI> which are kept in little Hutts, upon the remaining part of this Place; where|by this Fe&s;tival of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> &s;eems rather a <HI>Carna|val</HI> that draws hither again&s;t this time, a great number of Strangers, who agreeably pa&s;s away the&s;e few Days of the fine&s;t Sea&s;on in the year.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the Fea&s;ts and Ceremonies that are us'd at the Marriages of the Noble</HI> Venetians.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the Diver&s;ions u&s;ual to the plea|&s;ant Sea&s;ons, I will &s;ay &s;omething of them, accidentally proceeding from different Occa&s;ions: And of the&s;e I e&s;teem the dancing Parties of the Nobility, as one of the principal Diver&s;ions of <HI>Venice.</HI> They frequently happen upon divers ac|counts, but I will here endeavour to de&s;cribe tho&s;e that are ob&s;erv'd at the Marriages of the Nobles, which may at the &s;ame time &s;et forth the mo&s;t remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages in the Nuptial Ceremonies of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility. Yet as it is nece&s;&s;ary to know in &s;ome Degree the particular di&s;po&s;iti|on of their Hou&s;es, before one can comprehend their manner of Dancing; &s;o you will find that they are generally all after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The Entrance is commonly by a long Pa&s;&s;age, who&s;e Walls are extremely white, without any other Furniture, than &s;ome Benches of a very white Wood, with Backs to &s;upport the Body from the Wall: The&s;e Benches are painted in various Colours, as likewi&s;e the Racks on both &s;ides, which are furni&s;h'd with Pikes and Hal|bards,
<PB N="97" REF="192">
more for the Ornament of them than any other occa&s;ion of Defence. The Stairs then re|ceive you, which lead to another &s;ort of Gallery, that is over the Entry below: This Place takes up the length of the whole Hou&s;e; there are Win|dows at each of the Ends, from whence you have a Communication to all the Chambers, both on the Right and Left; for they open into each other, whereby you are enabled to make the Tour of the whole Hou&s;e upon a Level, which may be done &s;everal ways.</P>
<P>The Richer &s;ort of Gentlemen are mightily delighted with Magnificent Furniture, in who&s;e Hou&s;es may be &s;een great Quantities of Velvet on Gold-Grounds, others Imbroider'd, Lac'd and Fring'd with Gold. An abundance of fine Ta|bles and Looking-Gla&s;&s;es of great Value, but there are no Beds in the Chambers of the fir&s;t Sto|ry, which is to leave more Room to the great re&s;ort of People that are here upon the&s;e Occa|&s;ions, even in &s;pight of the Guards that are pla|ced at the Doors, to prevent the confu&s;ion and di&s;order of a Crowd.</P>
<P>The Day of Betrothing being appointed, the fir&s;t Senators, that is, the Procurators of Saint <HI>Mark,</HI> the great Sages and others that are their Relations (the Nobility and Ladies being u&s;ually Invited thither) do a&s;&s;emble in the Gallery above-Stairs. But before they let in the Crowd at the Door, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">La Novizza il Novizzo.</NOTE> <HI>Noviciate</HI> (&s;o they call the New-Married People for the fir&s;t two years) appears at this Place, in a <HI>Brocade</HI> of Silver, being led by the u&s;ual Ma&s;ter of the Ce|remonies, who is the <HI>Dancing-Ma&s;ter</HI> that teaches
<PB N="98" REF="193">
the Lady the Dances &s;he is to know, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Country, upon the Day of her Marriage.</P>
<P>This Man wears a long Robe, a &s;hort Cloak of Black Damask, and a Collar of the &s;ame; &s;o with Hat in Hand, and a grave &s;low Motion, he leads the Spou&s;e to her Father, where a Vel|vet-Cu&s;hion is laid for the Lady to kneel, who then de&s;tres her Father's Ble&s;&s;ing. In the &s;ame manner, and upon the &s;ame Account, he con|ducts her to her Mother, and the re&s;t of her near Relations, which is ob&s;erv'd with &s;o much Mode&s;ty and Conduct; that it may in reality pa&s;s for one of the mo&s;t extraordinary things that are to be &s;een at <HI>Venice.</HI> After this, the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies conducts the Lady to the middle of the Gallery, to give her Hand to the Husband, and there to receive the Bene|diction of the Prie&s;t or Bi&s;hop that is to perform the Function. Whereupon the Married Couple are permitted to Salute, which they pretend to be the fir&s;t Favour that the Gentleman receives in Earne&s;t of tho&s;e he is to have the Night after: At this In&s;tant the young Nobility pre&s;ent, ac|company the Ki&s;s with a many agreeable Wi&s;hes, crying out aloud, <HI>Ba&s;a, Ba&s;a, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom of lying together before Marri|age, is not practi&s;ed only at <HI>Venice;</HI> for the &s;ame is ob&s;erv'd almo&s;t throughout the whole <HI>Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical State:</HI> But it is moreover a particular Privilege of the Nobility, or rather a Cu&s;tom introduc'd from an ample Power of Marrying without any other notice given of the Banes, than the Declaration which is made in the Great Coun|cil: For as the Nobles are a &s;eparate Body from
<PB N="99" REF="193">
the other Members of the State, and the Lords of the Government; &s;o no body but they only of that Body, can pretend to enter into the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of their Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>After this Ceremony is over, the Violins be|gin to play, upon which they make an open Space in the middle of the Crowd, where the new-married Lady dances alone, two or three &s;everal Courrants, as likewi&s;e &s;o many of this Country-Bourreys. However, I believe they think to do them according to the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hi|on; yet it is no le&s;s difficult for us to know their Tunes, than the Steps and the Motions of their Bodies &s;eem intirely different from the Liberty and Grace that is Habitual to the <HI>French.</HI> One mu&s;t have been Born and Bred at <HI>Venice</HI> to be&s;tow one's Publick Applau&s;es upon the&s;e mean Performances of the poor Ladies, which are moreover very rarely &s;een to keep time with the Mu&s;ick; yet they plea&s;e, and the whole A&s;|&s;embly u&s;ually cry <HI>Ha balato divinamente.</HI></P>
<P>When the Ball is thus begun, a young Gen|tleman of the neare&s;t Relations to the Lady, takes her by the Hand; &s;everal others do the &s;ame by the re&s;t, or greate&s;t part of the other <HI>Gentledonna</HI>'s; &s;o they walk two and two di&s;|cour&s;ing from Room to Room, through all the Apartments of the Hou&s;e. There is Mu&s;ick in all the Places where the Ball pa&s;&s;es, but their Tunes are very different, and more proper to In|&s;pire a de&s;ire of &s;leeping, than that of Mirth; for which rea&s;on, without ob&s;erving either Mea|&s;ure or Cadence, they only apply them&s;elves to entertain the Per&s;on they have by the Hand: For as the Liberty of Conver&s;ation is not a Happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="100" REF="194">
frequently enjoy'd at <HI>Venice;</HI> &s;o the&s;e Balls are regarded as the mo&s;t favourable Opportu|nities of unfolding their Sentiments, where they make the mo&s;t u&s;e of their Time, without any thoughts of Dancing.</P>
<P>This manner of Walking continues until Night, by rea&s;on there are ever &s;ome new Dancers, that are ready to &s;ucceed to the fir&s;t, who &s;eldom leave a Lady that is agreeable to them, until &s;he is either weary, or that they apprehend the two long continuation of it may render their Conduct &s;u|&s;pected. But the Ladies may well be &s;oon tir'd, the Crowd being commonly &s;o great upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, that one mu&s;t frequently in a manner force their way through it, to pa&s;s out of one Chamber into another: Be&s;ides, an endle&s;s num|ber of Embarra&s;ments &s;top them at every turn, but e&s;pecially their mighty long Trains are none of the lea&s;t Inconveniencies. The <HI>Gentledonna</HI>'s that are not taken up with Dancing, &s;it in Elbow-Chairs, that are plac'd round about the Gallery. Such as are not invited to the Fea&s;t, appear in their Ma&s;ques, to the end they may not be ask'd to Dance: And they of the Invited that are not de&s;irous of it, keep their Glove on their Hand; which is allow'd for a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e. And the Nobles that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the Ladies are not to take the Refu&s;al ami&s;s; for which rea|&s;on they do not Addre&s;s them&s;elves to a Lady, unle&s;s &s;he be without her Glove, which is an a&s;|&s;ured Sign that the Lady will not decline the Of|fer; &s;ince, according to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Venice,</HI> it would be a high piece of ill Breeding, for a Lady to give a Gentleman her Hand with the Glove on.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="194">
The Plea&s;ures of the&s;e Balls are only to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility; for Strangers and the No|bles in Ma&s;ques are not admitted to the liberty of Dancing. However, both the one and the other endeavour to Entertain the Ladies they like, at lea&s;t they have the &s;atisfaction of taking a full View of them; and if they are in Intrigue with them, they endeavour to make u&s;e of the favourable Juncture; which is very rare, by rea|&s;on they are too narrowly ob&s;erv'd in the&s;e Pla|ces. Yet during the la&s;t hour of the Ball, the Ma&s;ques are u&s;ually permitted to Dance. It is then that our Secret Lovers make the be&s;t of the Opportunity; and that they may Entertain their Mi&s;ter&s;&s;es with more freedom and le&s;s &s;u&s;picion, they frequently find the means of expeditiou&s;ly changing their Habits. As there are very few Husbands who are not inqui&s;itive to know with whom their Wives have Danc'd; &s;o there are likewi&s;e but few of the Ladies, that are not able to an&s;wer the Impertinencies of &s;uch frivolous Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>However, no Body but the Brothers and the neare&s;t of Kin to the <HI>Gentledonnas,</HI> do a&s;&s;ume the liberty of talking familiarly with them, who &s;it fix'd in their Chairs like &s;o many Statues; all the Gentlemen &s;tanding at &s;ome little di&s;tance from them, while the Ma&s;ques and the Stran|gers go through the Rows, con&s;idering with much ea&s;e the Beauties of the Ladies, as they &s;lowly pa&s;s by them: In the mean time they are con|tinually ply'd with cover'd Cry&s;tal-Cups of Sher|bet, and all &s;orts of ic'd Waters. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentry and the Strangers have their Shares of the&s;e Liquors; but for the Entertainment of the
<PB N="102" REF="195">
others, there is a &s;eparate Chamber. In this manner the&s;e Marriage-Fea&s;ts continue, for the &s;pace of two Days, that is, from two in the Af|ternoon, until the Hour of the <HI>Fre&s;que</HI> in the Evening; and in Winter they Dance by Candle-Light, until it is Supper-time.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> Regate, <HI>or Rowing-Matches of the</HI> Gondolo<HI>'s.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Republick</HI> thinks fit to Enter|tain a Prince or any Foreigner of Qua|lity with a Publick Sight, it is u&s;ually with the Diver&s;ion of the <HI>Regate;</HI> that is, a Tryal of Skill is appointed between &s;everal &s;orts of Boats. The&s;e are the beloved Holy-days, and the Darling-Diver&s;ion of <HI>Venice;</HI> for the U&s;e of the Oar is &s;o much the <HI>Genius</HI> of the People, that every one in a manner applies him&s;elf to it; as like|wi&s;e the greate&s;t part of the young Nobility, not only through the de&s;ign of &s;hewing their great Strength and Addre&s;s, but that they may upon cer|tain Occa&s;ions be able to di&s;pen&s;e with the Ser|vice of their <HI>Gondoliers,</HI> e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Tran&s;|actions that are perform'd be&s;t without Witne&s;|&s;es. When a con&s;iderable <HI>Regate</HI> is de&s;ign'd, there is order'd a certain number of middle and le&s;&s;er &s;iz'd <HI>Gondolo's,</HI> with as many <HI>Fi&s;olero's,</HI> which are &s;o very &s;mall and light, that they may be ea&s;ily carried upon a Man's Shoulders. The&s;e Matches are commonly for three of each &s;ort of the&s;e Boats, one with four Oars, the other of two, and the the third but one: The diver|&s;ity
<PB N="103" REF="195">
renders the Shew very plea&s;ant, which is yet more, for the greater number of Matches.</P>
<P>They who &s;trive for the <HI>Regate</HI> or Prize, of the <HI>Gondolo's,</HI> endeavour to chu&s;e them that are the lighte&s;t and be&s;t Built, from whence they take all the Furniture; even &s;o much as the two Irons at the ends: They Scrape and Tallow her, and &s;ometimes u&s;e Soap, to render her way thro' the Water more ea&s;y: Yet lea&s;t the&s;e disfurni&s;h'd Boats might chance to open, through the great &s;tre&s;s of the Action, they fa&s;ten a Rope very &s;trongly from the Head to her Stern; nailing cro&s;s her &s;everal light Triangular Plates, which mightily pre&s;erves her from the Violence of the Agitation. They that have the Management of the other &s;ort of Boats, do u&s;e the like nece&s;&s;ary Precautions, as likewi&s;e to prepare them&s;elves for it, with Exerci&s;ing their Bodies, and trying their Boats.</P>
<P>Nothing can be finer than the Great <HI>Canal</HI> upon which they Row the&s;e Matches. The Bal|conies and Windows of all the Hou&s;es and Pa|laces, are Adorn'd with rich Carpets and Cu&s;hi|ons and fill'd with mighty numbers of People: The Roofs of the Hou&s;es, the Bridge of <HI>Rialto,</HI> and a prodigious number of <HI>Gondolos</HI> and Barques on both &s;ides are cover'd with People: In this manner appear'd that <HI>Regate,</HI> which Cardinal <HI>Delfino</HI> made not long &s;ince for the Cardinal <HI>Chi|gi,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he was then at <HI>Venice Inco|gnito.</HI></P>
<P>To render this Diver&s;ion the finer, &s;everal of the Young Nobility &s;et out certain <HI>Peotes:</HI> The&s;e are long Barques, that have a Deck of Planks, upon which are &s;pread Carpets of Damask, or
<PB N="104" REF="196">
Turkey-Work, that reach even down to the Wa|ter. Ten <HI>Gondoliers,</HI> all clad in the &s;ame Live|ry, have the working of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, which they ever do &s;tanding upright; and the two or three Nobles that are at the Expence of the Boat, lye in Masques upon the Cu&s;hions that are at the Head, attended by &s;everal Trumpets in the Stern. The great Number, and the variety of the <HI>Peotes,</HI> are the principal Ornaments of the&s;e Sights; which are always made in fair Weather. The Boats that are to Row for the Prizes do meet at that end of the City neare&s;t the <HI>Lido,</HI> where tho&s;e that are Equipp'd for the &s;ame Match, lye rang'd in a Line, from whence they give way upon the Signal that is made them by the Trumpets.</P>
<P>It would be no great Diver&s;ion to &s;ee the Boats that contend for the Prizes, pa&s;s alone with much &s;wiftne&s;s; but the <HI>Peotes</HI> which in a manner fly through the Water, do preceed the re&s;t, to ob|viate all Embara&s;&s;ments that would be otherwi&s;e continually happening. The great number of Four-Oar <HI>Gondolos;</HI> the multitudes of Boats fol|lowing them; the perpetual Acclamations of the People, to animate the Contenders in Emulation of each other, and to &s;hew their utmo&s;t Strength and Addre&s;s. All the&s;e added together, do certain|ly make one of the mo&s;t extraordinary Sights that can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;een. The length of this Cour&s;e, is from the place before-mention'd, to the end of the Great <HI>Canal,</HI> where, in the mid&s;t of the Wa|ter, there is a great Pile Erected, round which they are oblig'd to pa&s;s, returning with all ima|ginable Expedition to the Palace; for here the Prizes are di&s;tributed to them who fir&s;t leap into a Boat that is adorn'd and a&s;&s;ign'd for this pur|po&s;e.

Three Prizes are allow'd to each <HI>Regate;</HI> the fir&s;t and &s;econd are in Money or Plate, but the third is a Pig of two or three Months old, from whence comes the Revilings of the <HI>Gondoliers, Terzo di Regate.</HI></P>
<P>When the fir&s;t Match is over, the <HI>Peotes</HI> re|turn to the Starting-Place, to &s;et off another, which is perform'd with the &s;ame Ceremonies: Yet of all the&s;e various <HI>Regates,</HI> the Boats with four Oars, that pa&s;s with mo&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, are not e&s;teem'd as the plea&s;ante&s;t Sights. Tho&s;e that are work'd by one Man, whether <HI>Gondolos,</HI> Boats, or <HI>Fi&s;oleros,</HI> have &s;omething that render them much more extraordinary: For you behold a ro|bu&s;t <HI>Gondolier</HI> upon the Poop, naked to his mid|dle, his Head bound, his Face pale and fixed, his Body &s;tooping to the Oar, all his Mu&s;cles extended, and his Brea&s;t &s;woln; u&s;ing his utmo&s;t Efforts to get the better of his Adver&s;aries: How|ever, he is to manage his Strength in &s;uch manner as it may la&s;t him to the end of the Cour&s;e, which is about two Miles.</P>
<P>As Skill is not le&s;s requi&s;ite than Strength in all the&s;e &s;orts of Exerci&s;es; &s;o it is extremely plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve the&s;e Men take their Advan|tages, either in avoiding the force of the oppo|&s;ite Stream, and keeping in the very Heart of the Tide, when it is with them: Or directly follow|ing the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Peotes,</HI> which by opening of the Water, do render their way more ea&s;y. Their Artifices do &s;ometimes proceed farther, e&s;|pecially when near each other; for he that has got on Head of the other, &s;eldom fails of cun|ningly giving his Foot to the Boat of his Adver|&s;ary, by which means he advances him&s;elf, and
<PB N="106" REF="197">
throws back the other. Yet the <HI>Regates</HI> of the Women, which for their &s;ingularity, excell all tho&s;e of the Men; are frequently added to ren|der the Sight more diverting. For many of the Fi&s;her-mens Wives being us'd to go off with their Husbands, are in a manner no le&s;s dex|trous at this Work than the Men; in&s;omuch that they of two Oars, have oftentimes done very extraordinary Matters in the&s;e Occa&s;ions. But as the Women have not that Vigour and Boldne&s;s, which is nece&s;&s;ary in Attempts of this nature; &s;o the Prizes that are be&s;tow'd upon them, are inferiour to tho&s;e which are de&s;ign'd for the Men.</P>

During which, you are &s;ure to find a prodigious Concour&s;e of Peo|ple upon the Place of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and the &s;ame in the <HI>Mercery,</HI> where the Ladies do u&s;ually take up their Standing, in the Shops of the Mer|chants. Yet as a Publick Rejoycing, without the Liberty of the Ma&s;ques, would here be but little &s;atisfactory; &s;o &s;eldom le&s;s than one half of the Spectators are &s;ure to be in Di&s;gui&s;e; e&s;peci|ally the Women and Courte&s;ans, to the end they may partake of the Joy of the&s;e Ceremonies with the le&s;s Con&s;traint, as likewi&s;e the Plea&s;ures of their farther and more particular De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The New Procuratour goes to the Church of St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> at the Entrance into the <HI>Mercery,</HI> where he is met by all the Procuratours, Sena|tors, and &s;uch of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentry, as ac|company him to his Audience. After ha|ving heard High Ma&s;s, which is perform'd in great Solemnity, and with the be&s;t of Mu&s;ick; they go out two and two together. If the Pro|curatour is a Knight of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> he wears a Cap of Gold upon his Head: He is led by the Senior Procuratour, in which manner he is fol|low'd by the re&s;t. The&s;e are follow'd by the Nobles, the Friends and Relations of the Procu|ratour, all in the Ducal Ve&s;t of Purple: In which Order they proceed through an incredible Con|cour&s;e of People, until he comes to St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Palace, where he goes up to the <HI>College,</HI> who&s;e Doors are open, according to the Cu&s;tom that

He likewi&s;e is to ob&s;erve the &s;ame Method in three times Saluting of the <HI>College,</HI> but he takes his Place between the Great Sages, and the la&s;t of the three Pre&s;idents of the Forty Crimi|nal, which is the Place that belongs to the Envoys of Princes. After having return'd his Thanks to the <HI>Republick,</HI> for his Election, and taken the u&s;ual Oaths; he goes from thence with the &s;ame Attendance, to the New Procuratory's, where he enters into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Dignity.</P>
<P>If the Finery of the <HI>Mercery,</HI> the concour&s;e of People, the great number of Ma&s;ques, that are permitted, even to enter the <HI>College,</HI> and the Pre&s;ence of the Nobility a&s;&s;i&s;ting at this Ce|remony, do render this Shew very Noble and Magnificent; the Return of the Procuratour is no ways le&s;s Graceful and Stately. He goes in|to his <HI>Gondolo</HI> at the Pillars of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> where he is &s;aluted by the Cannon of the Galley, that always lyes there; and in ca&s;e there be any more lying ready at <HI>Venice,</HI> they, upon this Occa&s;ion come to an Anchor in the Great <HI>Canal;</HI> where they hang out all their Streamers and Penants; &s;aluting him with the Di&s;charge of both great and &s;mall Shot.

Yet in ca&s;e of any Defraud in the di&s;tribution of the Bread, the Wine and the Money, as happen'd at a preceding Election; the&s;e Huzza's and Acclamations of Joy, are then but feebly repeated; as likewi&s;e the whole medly of this Confu&s;ion, which com|po&s;es the principal part of the Fea&s;t.

<P>Such a Rejoycing is not ended in one Fore|noon, but the Diver&s;ion is for three Days con|tinued, by Balls at the Hou&s;e of the New Pro|curatour; where the great Re&s;ort of People, the number of Ma&s;ques, the Riches of the Furni|ture, the cooling Liquors, which are not in the&s;e Occa&s;ions le&s;s abounding, than at the Marriages of the Nobility; during which, there are not only Fire-works and Bonfires, before the Hou&s;e

<HEAD>Of their Boxing or Fights at Cuffs.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Il Pugni.</NOTE>THE City is divided, as it has been ob&s;erv'd, into Six &s;everal Quarters; three being on this &s;ide, and as many on the other &s;ide of the Great <HI>Canal.</HI> Yet the People are divided only into two Factions, each of which has three Wards or Quarters in their Parties. The <HI>Ca&s;telani</HI> are the fir&s;t, who have that Name from the Quarter of <HI>Ca&s;telo,</HI> in which is the Patriarchal Church at one of the extremities of this City. The others are the <HI>Nicoletti's,</HI> &s;o call'd from the Church of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> at the farthe&s;t end of the Quarter, which has the greate&s;t number of Common People and Fi&s;hermen, who are the brave&s;t and tho&s;e that make the be&s;t Sport in the&s;e Engage|ments. So the Party of the <HI>Nicoletto's</HI> has commonly the Advantage over their Adver&s;aries the <HI>Ca&s;telans.</HI> The Animo&s;ity of the People &s;eems &s;o great in the&s;e Occa&s;ions, which I am at pre&s;ent upon De&s;cribing, That one would think a People brought up in the&s;e Partialities, and in this manner &s;o &s;trangely divided &s;hould never be able to live in that Union and Tranquillity which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of the State.</P>
<P>There are among the&s;e &s;orts of People, &s;everal Heads of the Factions, who really believe, That
<PB N="111" REF="199">
they cannot be e&s;teem'd as Men of Worth, if they engage into the oppo&s;ite Party. In&s;omuch that they had rather mi&s;s a good Opportunity of pro|viding for their Daughters, than to marry them to a Man of the contrary Side. The&s;e Partiali|ties are not found to affect the Common People only, but even in &s;ome mea&s;ure to reach the No|bility, who declare them&s;elves of the Faction of the Quarter they live in; yet with this Diffe|rence, That they e&s;teem the&s;e Boxing-Matches for Diver&s;ions, which the meaner People convert into an Affair of Importance and Reputation. And among the re&s;t, even the Strangers are En|gag'd into the Parties: For &s;uch as come to <HI>Ve|nice</HI> from <HI>Chio&s;a</HI> are e&s;teem'd as <HI>Ca&s;telans;</HI> and tho&s;e who arrive here by <HI>Me&s;tre,</HI> or by <HI>Fucine,</HI> are reputed <HI>Nicholettis.</HI></P>
<P>There is no doubt but that the <HI>Republick</HI> can, without much trouble, di&s;per&s;e the&s;e Partialities, by continually preventing the two Parties from coming to Blows, as it &s;ometimes happens. But the Senate is of the Opinion, That if the People &s;hould form a Con&s;piracy again&s;t the State, or the Nobility, that it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, for two &s;uch oppo&s;ite Factions to u|nite &s;o far, as to joyn in a De&s;ign of this nature: By which means they think them&s;elves &s;ecure of one half, or at lea&s;t to oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of the other, by the ready Succours they might expect from the contrary Party: And the rather, by rea|&s;on that the <HI>Ca&s;telans</HI> e&s;teem them&s;elves for a more civiliz'd People than the <HI>Nicoletti's;</HI> as al&s;o more engag'd to the Nobility, and zealous to the Government: Therefore the <HI>Republick</HI> do's not only tolerate this Divi&s;ion already reign|ing
<PB N="112" REF="200">
in the People; but they likewi&s;e encrea&s;e it, by permitting of it to be ob&s;erv'd, in that man|ner it is acted.</P>
<P>If the Pre&s;idents of the Council of Ten, who are the principal Officers of the Civil Govern|ment, &s;hould permit the full Liberty of the&s;e Fights to the People, &s;o great is the Animo&s;ity, as likewi&s;e the de&s;ire of acquiring the Reputation of being a Man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Che fa ben i pugni.</NOTE> <HI>that u&s;es his Fi&s;ts well,</HI> &s;o &s;trong among the <HI>Gondo|liers</HI> and Populace; That the&s;e Ex|erci&s;es would not only happen up|on every Holy-day, as they frequently do upon certain Bridges of the City; but they would undoubtedly become common to the Day, even throughout all the Sea&s;ons of the Year. The difficulty which is found in preventing the&s;e Fights, when any of the Pre&s;idents of the Coun|cil of Ten are again&s;t it; may be admitted as a very good In&s;tance of what is here &s;aid. For the Captain of the <HI>Sbirri's</HI> and his People, are &s;carce able to get tho&s;e Orders obey'd, being the Guard that is placed upon Saint <HI>Barnaby's</HI> Bridge, which is the u&s;ual Field of Battel, and do's only prevent them at that Place; for they are &s;ure to &s;eek others more remote, rather than to be depriv'd of the plea&s;ure of Fighting.</P>
<P>Such of the <HI>Gondoliers</HI> as have acquir'd the Reputation of good Boxers, will not hire them|&s;elves, unle&s;s they are permitted, by the Agree|ment to &s;ignalize them&s;elves in the&s;e Famous Oc|ca&s;ions. Even the little Children, that acciden|tally meet in the Streets, do demand of each other, who they are for; and if they are of con|trary Factions, they are certain not to part with|out
<PB N="113" REF="200">
Blows. The Humour runs &s;trangely upon this rough Exerci&s;e, for the people do ever &s;top to behold and encourage them; even to &s;uch a degree, that the mo&s;t general Diver&s;ion of this City, is the Sight of the <HI>Pugni,</HI> as they are practis'd in almo&s;t all the Sea&s;ons of the Year; being &s;ometimes &s;een, even when the Ice is in the <HI>Canals.</HI> The order that I did propo&s;e to my &s;elf, has not permited me to &s;peak of it in any other Place; &s;o I &s;hall Conclude the De|&s;cription of the Publick <HI>Recreations,</HI> with that of the&s;e <HI>Fights,</HI> which are of three different &s;orts; <HI>viz. La Montre, La Frotte,</HI> and the <HI>Battel-Array.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La Montre</HI> is that &s;ort of Fight which is per|form'd Hand to Hand, between two Men, but with very &s;ingular Circum&s;tances. The Bridge of St. <HI>Barnaby</HI> is u&s;ually the <HI>Theater</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Tragy-Comedies;</HI> for this Bridge hath an equal number of Steps on each &s;ide, as likewi&s;e two Keys, almo&s;t of an equal bigne&s;s, which is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Parties of the two Factions; &s;o that the Advantages in all re&s;pects are equal on both &s;ides: Moreover, the <HI>Canal</HI> is long and directly &s;traight, who&s;e Hou&s;es are by this means con|veniently &s;cituated for the great number of Spectators that flock hither from all Parts of the City, &s;o &s;oon as the&s;e Boxing-Matches are known. The Hou&s;es and Windows are not only fill'd with them, but likewi&s;e the tops of the Hou&s;es; the Keys and Neighbouring Bridges are cover'd with 'em, as al&s;o the Barques and <HI>Gondolo's</HI> in the <HI>Canal.</HI></P>
<P>Yet the particular Matches are not begun un|til the Godfathers are come to the Bridge. The&s;e are two &s;erious and notable Burgers, who have
<PB N="114" REF="201">
by their Valour in the&s;e &s;orts of Exerci&s;es, rais'd them&s;elves to the Dignity of Arbiters of Victo|ry, and Judges of the Bravery of the Comba|tants: The&s;e Worthies lay by their Cloaks, and after &s;everal Conferences on both &s;ides, for the Regulation of &s;uch things as might otherwi&s;e oc|ca&s;ion a Difference, they go up to the Top of the Bridge, which is built like others; that is, flat about four or five Paces in length, and three or four in breadth, Pav'd with Brick, and rais'd on each &s;ide with Free-Stone, but without any Rails, or other Security. The&s;e are the Principal Articles of the Fight.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are not to &s;trike their Adver&s;ary when they have thrown him upon the Ground, without pa&s;&s;ing for mean-&s;pirited, and unworthy the Ho|nour of Fighting; therefore the Judges do imme|diately part them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Victory &s;hall be declared in his be|half that fir&s;t draws Blood of his Adver&s;ary at the No&s;e, Mouth, or the Face, which is call'd</HI> romper il mu&s;taccio &amp; e&s;&s;er rotte: <HI>But as the Combatants are not obliged to open their Mouths, and to &s;hew if tho&s;e &s;laps on the Chops have not mov'd the Blood; &s;o it is very ridiculou&s;ly plea&s;ant to &s;ee them keep their Lips clo&s;e &s;hut, and making Signs to the Judges, that they are not out of Heart, but re|&s;olv'd to di&s;pute the Victory to their utmo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That in ca&s;e there is no Blood &s;hed on either &s;ide, in the fir&s;t three Heats, the Combatants &s;hall go off, and make way for others; but they are made to Embrace by the Judges, and &s;o part good Friends.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He that throws his Adver&s;ary into the</HI> Ca|nal, <HI>is to have a double Victory adjudged to him.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>And La&s;tly, If one of either Party pre&s;ents</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="201">
<HI>him&s;elf, and none of the other dare to di&s;pute it with him, as it &s;ometimes happens; that this Ad|vantage &s;hall not be le&s;s e&s;teem'd, than if he had Vanqui&s;h'd his Rival.</HI> So he that meets with this Piece of good Fortune &s;hews him&s;elf not a little proud of it; for having &s;ome time &s;tood to offer him&s;elf, to all that are willing to An|&s;wer the Challenge, he &s;alutes the Company with a Leg and his Cap, and retires.</P>
<P>When Matters are thus order'd, the Endea|vours are on both Sides equal, to go fir&s;t up to the Bridge, for to &s;hew them&s;elves the fir&s;t Be|ginners of the&s;e Exerci&s;es, who get immediately free of their Shoes and Wa&s;tcoats, and &s;lipping their Shirts down to the Wa&s;te, they roll it about them, with the long Sa&s;hes which they u&s;ually wear. They have a Glove on their Right Hand, to the end the Fi&s;t may be the firmer, and their Hair being tuck'd up under their Caps, they place them&s;elves at the two Angles, oppo&s;ite to the Platform of the Bridge; and the two God|fathers take their Standings on the other two &s;ides; leaving to them the full Liberty of the Field of Battel.</P>
<P>It is no &s;mall matter of Admiration to &s;ee with what Strength and Fury the &s;toute&s;t of the&s;e Fellows do accompany the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Para&s;&s;alto.</NOTE> Blows they give their Adver&s;aries; the Sound of which may be almo&s;t as far heard as &s;een, which are commonly made at the Face or the &s;mall of the Ribbs; in&s;omuch, that &s;ome|times one of them is knock'd down with the fir&s;t &s;troke of his Enemy, when it chances to light full upon his Chin or Temple, which lays him as flat as if he were Thunder-Struck. To &s;ee them
<PB N="116" REF="202">
thus tumble inanimate, and frequently breaking their Heads in the Fall; one would not imagine that it &s;hou'd pa&s;s for a trifle, and they recover again.</P>
<P>Others are &s;o vigorous and &s;ure of their &s;trokes, which they repeat with &s;o much Dexterity and Agility, without ever coming to clo&s;ing, or gi|ving time to their Adver&s;aries to look about them, but quickly oblige them to &s;eek their Safety, by leaping into the <HI>Canal;</HI> immediately expre&s;&s;ing the Joy of &s;o compleat a Victory, with their re|bounding Capers, which are accompanied by the repeated Huzza's of the People of that Faction. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentry, who are at the Windows on that &s;ide of the Bridge with their Party, are u&s;ually tho&s;e who make the mo&s;t noi&s;e, and that &s;hew them&s;eves mo&s;t affected with the&s;e Ad|vantages; who &s;tretching them&s;elves out of the Windows, flouri&s;h their Handkerchiefs in Te|&s;timony of the Victory's being on their &s;ide; as likewi&s;e to animate the remaining Combatants, to an ample Performance of their Parts.</P>
<P>However, tho&s;e Accidents are no &s;ooner over, and the Combatants retir'd to their re&s;pective Parties, but their Places are in&s;tantly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by two others, who, that they may not lo&s;e time, do generally &s;tand ready-&s;tripp'd, and in a Po&s;ture of engaging. This u&s;ually continues a whole Afternoon, before the Victory becomes determi|nable; upon which, the Succe&s;sful have no other Prize, than the Reputation and Glory of their brave Actions, which they are &s;ufficiently careful to perpetuate, even to Po&s;terity. For many of them will have them&s;elves painted in the Po&s;ture they are accu&s;tomed to Fight, with their Names,
<PB N="117" REF="202">
and the Particulars of their mighty Deeds.</P>
<P>The latter end of the Day is concluded with reckoning up the Number of Battels won and lo&s;t of each &s;ide, which is ever very Honoura|ble to the Superiour Party: But what is mo&s;t re|garded, is the number of tho&s;e that are thrown into the <HI>Canal;</HI> as being what the Combatants do mo&s;t endeavour to avoid, after they are come to Clo&s;ing, by u&s;ing their utmo&s;t Efforts to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the di&s;-reputation of &s;uch an Overthrow; rather chu&s;ing the wor&s;t of Con&s;e|quences, from tho&s;e terrible Falls that &s;ometimes happen to them, by lighting upon the Steps of the Bridge, than to be thrown into the Water, where they meet with no Contu&s;ions. But the plea&s;ante&s;t Sight of all, is to behold one of the&s;e Fellows thrown over the Bridge, yet hanging by his Adver&s;ary's Hair, and the other endeavouring to avoid being drawn into the Water by him, who is mo&s;t an end finally oblig'd to follow him into the <HI>Canal,</HI> where the Water parts them; For no &s;ooner are they over the Bridge, and from the Ground, but all Animo&s;ities cea&s;e; each of them &s;trugling for him&s;elf, and they the &s;ame good Friends they were before the Fight.</P>
<P><HI>La Frotte</HI> is an Engagement of &s;everal that be|gins Accidentally, and without De&s;ign; but proceeds from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">La Frotte.</NOTE> Impatience which the Crowd of Combatants &s;hew, when they are once got to the Rendezvous, and the Judges not come regularly to receive the &s;everal Parties, according to the way of the <HI>Mon|tre.</HI> The Children being got fir&s;t up to the Bridge, in imitation of the Men, do commonly begin to Skirmi&s;h: The great Boys in&s;en&s;ibly ming|ling

them&s;elves with them, render the Di&s;pute &s;o warm, until at length the Men thinking their Ho|nours concern'd for to be Ma&s;ters of the Bridge, do likewi&s;e engage in the &s;ame Fray. Then is the Fight at the highe&s;t pitch, for each Party endeavours their utmo&s;t to drive off the Enemy: This Controver&s;y is maintain'd with &s;o much Ob&s;tinacy and Heat, that great numbers of them are tumbled into the <HI>Canal;</HI> who notwith&s;tanding their being cloathed, do &s;eem no more concern'd than if they had fell upon Straw.</P>
<P>Such as do not Fight, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to excite their Parties to behave them&s;elves Gallantly. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen encou|rage the Contenders, by &s;ometimes promi&s;ing them to Reward their Courage. It has &s;everal times hap|penned, that &s;ome of the&s;e Nobles have been &s;o zealous for the Reputation of their Factions; that through In|dignation to tho&s;e of their Party that have not behav'd them&s;elves to their Minds, they have gone from the Bridge, and &s;tripping them&s;elves of their Ve&s;ts, have e&s;pous'd the Party with the be&s;t of their Endeavours; by their Example in&s;piring Courage to the Vanqui&s;h'd, and bringing them off with Victory, or at lea&s;t by ha|ving more Honourably contended for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Battel-Array</HI> is a General Engagement that is made between the two Factions; but with all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Precautions that can be taken between the Par|ties, to render the Fight more Equal, that &s;o the Glory may be entire to the Victorious. When Cardinal <HI>Chigi</HI> was at <HI>Venice,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Delfino</HI> that Entertain'd him, was very de&s;irous to have &s;hewn him this Diver&s;ion, and was accordingly a con&s;iderable time Negotiating with the Heads of both the Parties, to induce them to a ge|neral and famous Battel. The Difficulties were &s;o great, that the Cardinal in Per&s;on &s;ollicited tho&s;e of the Arti&s;ans, that had the greate&s;t Authority in their Facti|ons: He went to their Shops, care&s;s'd, intreated, and promis'd them to be&s;tow a con&s;iderable Prize on the Victorious.</P>
<P>Matters were at length agreed on, a Bridge was cho|&s;en upon the Key of the <HI>Incurables,</HI> which is very &s;pa|cious.
<PB N="119" REF="203">
The Steps were made larger that were &s;ome|thing &s;maller than tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the Bridge; and certain Places of the Key were taken in with Planks, which otherwi&s;e would have permitted more &s;pace to the <HI>Nicoletti's,</HI> than it was po&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Ca&s;telans</HI> to have. The Fury of the Combat wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Thoughts of the People, nothing el&s;e was di&s;cours'd a|mong them; in&s;omuch that it &s;eem'd as if the entire O|verthrow of one of the Parties was at hand. But the Pre|&s;idents of the Council of Ten, with much rea&s;on fearing that this Animo&s;ity, which had hitherto never appear'd &s;o great, might be attended with dangerous Con&s;e|quences; thought it ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to forbid the Bat|tel: So unle&s;s the&s;e Parties do &s;ecretly agree between them&s;elves, there is no general Battel, or <HI>Guerra ordinata</HI> to be &s;een; yet when it happens, the greate&s;t part of the Combatants provide them&s;eves with Back and Brea&s;t-Pieces of Gilt Pa&s;tboard, which they put over their Naked Bodies, both for the finery of the Shew, as al&s;o to break the force of their Adver&s;aries Stroaks.</P>
<P>The Victory of this Battel, con&s;i&s;ts in getting Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Bridge, for which rea&s;on it do's not &s;o much depend upon the dint of Blows, as upon the Endeavours of both Parties to drive away their Adver&s;aries. Yet that the Di&s;pute may begin upon equal Terms, the Combatants put them&s;elves in order: The fir&s;t Ranks are brought clo&s;e to each other, upon the very Center of the Bridge: Then they begin to break each others Ranks with the greate&s;t Fury; but being well &s;upported, and each &s;ide alternatively pu&s;h'd by the other, &s;uch vio|lent Efforts are u&s;ually made, by the great number of Contenders, that they in the fir&s;t Ranks are of cour&s;e born from the Ground; or the main Bodies being clo|&s;er join'd than the Flanks, tho&s;e of both the Right and Left &s;ides, are con&s;equently &s;o violently pre&s;s'd by the Center, as they are &s;ometimes forc'd to leap into the Water, by Ffties and Sixties at a time.</P>
<P>In this Condition, only the fir&s;t Ranks of the two Parties are able to Fight, who are yet oblig'd to hold their Hands up, to have the free Exerci&s;e of them: The hindmo&s;t are &s;ure to get upon their Companions, and
<PB N="120" REF="204">
pa&s;&s;ing over their Heads go to Attack their Enemies, who&s;e No&s;es and Faces would undoubtedly &s;uffer, with|out any Danger to the A&s;&s;ailants; if they of the contrary Party did not take the &s;ame Method; in&s;omuch that the Fight of this &s;econd Story becomes more terrible than the other: In which Occa&s;ions the utmo&s;t Endeavours being repeated, with all imaginable Fury, to bring each others Flanks into Di&s;order; the greate&s;t Confu&s;ions hap|pen; at which time they are born by Crowds into the <HI>Canal.</HI> In&s;omuch, that it is really wonderful that the&s;e Fights are not terminated with the Death of a great many of the Combatants. Be&s;ides, the Heat of their Contention do's &s;o Animate this Multitude of People, and the Indignation of the Inferior Party is &s;o great, that they would undoubtedly betake them&s;elves to their Arms, if the Order was not very exact and rigorous in preventing the Danger of the&s;e Accidents. However, it has &s;ometimes happen'd, that the Pavement of the Key has been torn up, to make u&s;e of the Stones, for want of other Arms, whereby it is not without &s;ome rea&s;on that this Fight is call'd by the <HI>Venetians, una &s;tragge di Chri&s;tiani.</HI></P>
<P>The Rejoycings of the Victorious are continu'd for three Days after the Fight, for which purpo&s;e a Boat is Adorn'd with Garlands, and a great Crown hung in the middle, which they conduct with Beat of Drum, thro' all the <HI>Canals</HI> and Quarters of their Party; as likewi&s;e to the Hou&s;es of the Nobles as mo&s;t e&s;pous'd their Cau&s;e, who always be&s;tow &s;ome Money or Barrels of Wine on them, to Solemnize the Glory of the Victory. By Night they walk up and down with Flambeau's of Straw, fol|low'd by the Boys, who run after them on the Keys, per|petually Huzzaing the Name of their Faction. The Vanqui&s;hed are on the contrary &s;o mortifi'd, as &s;ome of them dare not return to their Habitations; for their Wives have &s;ometimes not only refus'd them Entrance, but driven them away; reviling their Cowardize with the mo&s;t injurious Terms, <HI>Via di qua infami, por chi vitupero&s;i.</HI></P>
