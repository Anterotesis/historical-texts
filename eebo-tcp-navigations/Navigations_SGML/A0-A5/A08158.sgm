<HEAD>MORE NEWES FROM THE PALATINATE, THE <HI>SE|cond time imprinted, the 5. of</HI> Iune.</HEAD>
<P>_SIR, to requite your newes out of <HI>England</HI> with &s;ome of ours out of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> which is as much I know de&s;ired by you there, as yours is heere; and now e&s;|pecially &s;ince the King of <HI>Bobemiaes</HI> arriuall among&s;t vs: &s;ince when, this Countrey, which before was but the field of warre, is now the &s;laughter-hou&s;e of men: wherein what acts of ho&s;tilitie, and what chances of warre haue fallen out, and how the braue and neuer e|nough commended Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> hath de|feated <HI>Tilly,</HI> and that misfortune on our &s;ide of that good Prince the Marquis of <HI>Baden,</HI> I leaue to you to reade in my former letters written to my other friends, a &s;ight of which you can at any time command; and therefore omitting them, plea&s;e you to heare the latter occurrences.</P>
<P>The Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> who is Landtgraue of <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> &amp; Bi&s;hop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> being a man engaged in the quarrel, as being the Emperours
<PB N="2" REF="3"> brother, one that is no raw &s;ouldier, for hee hath done much &s;eruice in the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> country, about that pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Valtoline</HI> (of which I &s;uppo&s;e you haue often heard) and therefore fit to be a Generall, &amp; e&s;pecially for that his coun|try lies &s;o co~moditou&s;ly to do vs a mi&s;chiefe, for he borders vpon the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spires,</HI> through who&s;e land, and ouer the Rhine he may in few dayes march, leade an army into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> which is next to <HI>Spires:</HI> this <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> I &s;ay, part|ly as it were to reuenge the di&s;grace receiued by Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who this la&s;t Winter hara&s;|&s;ed his country, euen to the taking compo&s;i|tion of his chiefe citie <HI>El&s;as Saueren</HI> or <HI>Zabern,</HI> and partly animated by the defeat of the Mar|quis of <HI>Baden;</HI> and for that the King of <HI>Bohe|mia</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> were bu&s;ied in taking in of townes, and of <HI>Laudenberg</HI> in particular, which &s;tands vpon the Neckar which runnes by <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> by which meanes <HI>Tillies</HI> pa&s;&s;age ouer the Neckaris cut off: &s;o that he perceiuing that by this diuerting of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> armies, he was not like to bee way-laid or intercepted in his march to <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> which was not far from him, being onely from his owne <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> into the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spires</HI> country, and &s;hort of the <HI>Palatinate.</HI> The rea&s;on of his purpo&s;e to be|&s;iege
<PB N="3" REF="3"> <HI>Hagenaw</HI> being in his friends countrey, was &s;ure for that Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> this la&s;t Winter when he ouer-ran both <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> and <HI>Spi|ers,</HI> had taken in this <HI>Hagenaw</HI> &amp; put a gari&s;on into it, &amp; had left be&s;ides &s;ome things of good importance in it: and againe, it &s;eemes that <HI>Leo|poldus</HI> &s;eeing the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spiers</HI> not able to re|couer the town, he thought it of very great im|portance to the aduancement of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in generall, which made him re&s;olue vpon a iourney in per&s;on thither: which if he could haue won, then the two Archdukes had ea&s;ily ioyned their forces together, whom this towne only kept a&s;under. Vpon the&s;e grounds &amp; for the&s;e rea&s;ons, he with a faire army of 7 or 8000 foot and 2000 hor&s;e, and drawing after him 6 or 7 peeces, marches vp the country, &amp; fairly &s;ets him downe before this <HI>Hagenaw</HI> there, after v&s;uall &s;ummons to yeeld, vpon the gari&s;ons re|fu&s;ing to parley, he fals to his battery, which he plied very hotly, doing all he could to get into it, before it could be releeued by our party. There were in the towne &s;ome 4000 foot and 500 hor&s;e, which the prouident Count <HI>Man&s;|feild</HI> had left there, and the&s;e made &s;hift to hold the town til they could aduerti&s;e their General of the danger of his gari&s;on; who vpon the fir&s;t notice, being then about <HI>Themer&s;heim</HI> in the
<PB N="4" REF="4"> <HI>Palatinate,</HI> came downe with the King of <HI>Bohe|mia,</HI> and the be&s;t part of 20000 men, to remoue the &s;iege; which was &s;o timely done, that (the enemy hauing gotte~ &s;ome of the town ditches and of their quarter) it was thought the towne could not haue held out aboue 2 dayes longer. Now <HI>Leopoldus</HI> hauing intercepted the letter of comfort which Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> &s;ent to the towne, promi&s;ing to come to releeue it by &s;uch a day &amp; houre; and hauing by his skouts lear|ned that <HI>Mansfeild</HI> with his army followed his me&s;&s;enger, perceiuing that he could not &s;o &s;ud|denly cary the towne, and fearing a &s;urpri&s;e, or to be hemd in with the Rhine, the towne gari|&s;on &amp; the Kings army, &s;ent &s;ome 9 or 10 hun|dred hor&s;e &amp; &s;ome few foot co~panies to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance in the way about <HI>Wi&s;enberg,</HI> &s;o to &s;tay <HI>Mansfeild</HI> a little, and with the lo&s;&s;e of the&s;e forlorne men to &s;aue the re&s;t of his maine army; with which he ro&s;e ha&s;tily &amp; &s;o tumul|tuou&s;ly, that the town gari&s;on taking notice &amp; aduantage of his &s;udden ri&s;ing and di&s;orderly tetrait, &s;allied forth; and what in the trenches (where commonly &s;ome &s;ick or hurt men that cannot follow, or others that tend vpon the baggage are left behinde,) and what in the Rereward which they fell vpon, they had the killing of 500 or 600 of the enemy.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>And by this time <HI>Count Mansfeild</HI> with the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> had di&s;patcht tho&s;e poore Co~panies afore&s;aid (which lay in their way,) and were at their heeles too: So that the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> being &s;o hotly pur&s;ued by a greater Armie, and by the <HI>Count Man&s;|feild,</HI> who hath &s;till had the ma&s;ter fortune of him, was forced to take the Rhine; ouer which, with &s;ome of tho&s;e which were nee|re&s;t to him, he wa&s;ted him&s;elfe; and it is &s;aid he e&s;caped &s;o narrowly, that <HI>Count Mansfeild</HI> was within halfe an houre of taking his Per&s;on. One part of his Armie which thought to haue pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Dru|&s;enheim, about the eighth or ninth of May, were cut off, and about 2000 Boats, Punts, and Rhine &s;hips were taken; in which the <HI>Mansfeildians</HI> them&s;elues pa&s;&s;ed, and on the other &s;ide, got great booty, which euery man had, that got. <HI>Leopold</HI> thought to rallee together his Armie which pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and to &s;eeke to ioyne with <HI>Tillye</HI> and goe in|to the Mark graue of <HI>Badens</HI> Country, or to Fryburgh to &s;eeke the enemie: But the <HI>Mansfeildians</HI> pur&s;uing them ouer the Rhine
<PB N="6" REF="5"> too, he with all &s;peed retired into his owne <HI>Al&s;atia, &amp; Bri&s;goia,</HI> as &s;ome of his companies that e&s;caped with the fir&s;t, did into Zabern, Dach&s;tein, Moltzheim, and other walled Towns thereabouts: &s;ome &s;ixe Cornets of hor&s;e got into a Wood, neither did Colonell <HI>Obertraut</HI> thinke it &s;afe to &s;et vpon them there, but he went into Strasburgh there by, and only kept the Countrie about it, and waited for their comming forth. And there for three daies they kept them&s;elues &s;afe e|nough, which they could not haue done in a plain &amp; ope~ field: For the defendants haue this aduantage of the A&s;&s;aylants in a Wood, That they neede not feare either ambu&s;h or &s;urpri&s;e; but the A&s;&s;aylant is rather wa|rie to enter tho&s;e thickets for feare of falling him&s;elfe into an Ambu&s;cado. Then again, again&s;t an Armie in a Wood, the enemy can haue &s;mall v&s;e of his hor&s;e; and the trees and bu&s;hes make his Pikes mo&s;tly vn|&s;eruiceable too. As for &s;hot, they may goe a birding if they plea&s;e, for any great good they can doe, for they &s;hall be &s;ure to hit more trees then men: whereas the defen|dants
<PB N="7" REF="5"> may better v&s;e their Armes; for their body of Pikes may be orderly rang'd, and may make a firme &s;tand, and are not cum|bred with carrying and entangling them a|mong the trees, but neede no more but charge them vpon the A&s;&s;aylants; and eue|ry tree againe, is as good as a towre for a Mu&s;quetier, from behind which he may at plea&s;ure and in &s;afetie almo&s;t di&s;charge; and the tree &s;erues him for a Re&s;t too: &s;o that an Armie there, feares nothing but firing the Coppis about their eares, or to be fami&s;ht if they be &s;o round be&s;et, that their hor&s;e can|not get out on the backe &s;ide to fetch in re|leefe; and this want of victuals was the ad|uantage which <HI>Count Mansfeild</HI> had of them: For when the &s;ouldiers had eate vp their vi|ctuals which they brought with them in their knap&s;acks, and drunke out all their water out of their bottels, or (tho&s;e that had it) their wine out of their Borachoes; there was no &s;tay for them in a de&s;art &s;uccourle&s;&s;e Forre&s;t; &s;o that hunger which breakes through &s;tone wals, and feares no wor&s;e enemie then it &s;elfe, made &s;ome of them
<PB N="8" REF="6"> rather out of &s;tomacke then courage, to ad|uenture forth; and &s;ending a Trumpet to Strasburgh to offer their &s;eruice to that State, came with their troupes within a Mu&s;quet &s;hot of the Towne, and there quietly expected their an&s;wer: The Bur|ghers, though they had no neede of hor&s;e|men, yet curteou&s;ly &s;ent them out bread and wine for them&s;elues, and oats for their hor|&s;es: with which, while they made merry, a younger Prince of the hou&s;e of Saxony (a man though not in any entertainment, yet friend to the Emperour) being then in Stra&s;|burgh, went out to them, per&s;wading with Colonel <HI>Mo&uuml;der</HI> their chiefe Commander, to returne to <HI>Leopoldus</HI> &s;eruice; which the braue Colonell <HI>Obertraut</HI> hearing of, &s;ent out of Strasburgh &amp; tooke the Prince pri&s;oner, &amp; &s;ent him to Hagenaw, whence we heare, he is to be &s;ent to vs to Manhem: Hereupon the whole &s;ixe Cornets yeelded to <HI>Obertraut,</HI> and tooke the oath to &s;erue the King of <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> and rent <HI>Leopoldus</HI> En&s;ignes, and re|ceiued the Kings Colours. They gaue no|tice al&s;o of &s;ixe Cornets of hor&s;e more, and
<PB N="9" REF="6"> one Company of foote which would doe likewi&s;e: of which wee haue not yet heard.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things went thus with them, another part of <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Armie had got into Lichtenaw, and fortifide it; the&s;e were &s;ome few Companies of foote, with fiue peeces of Ordnance, which they brought from Hagenaw; but by letters from &s;ome of them&s;elues the 12 of this May, it appeares they were &s;o weake, that they feare the Marque&s;&s;e of Badens comming vp|on them, who (though he hath receiued an ouerthrow &amp; lo&s;t his baggage and Canon, which he hath not yet recouered) hath now made ouer his Countrie to his Sonne, and hath rallyed the &s;catterd Regiments of his Armie together, and hath againe taken on tho&s;e Companies which he ca&s;t before, and &s;worne them in the name of the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> &s;o that he is &s;ixe or 7000 foote, and 1500 or 2000 hor&s;e in the field againe, and re&s;olues once more to try his fortune.</P>
<P>And thus you heare what is become of the Arch-Dukes men. One thing I had for|got,
<PB N="10" REF="7"> which was this, That when he ro&s;e from Hagenaw, he for ha&s;te left behind him one Morter, and two Wagons laden with Granades 250 Centeryes (hundred weights) of powder, 150 of match, and &s;ome other munition, which he put into a little village hard by, with a guard of 80 Mu&s;quetiers, who quickly yeelded what they were not able to keepe. It &s;eemes the Arch-Duke wanted hor&s;e to draw away his Canon, and was faine to take tho&s;e out of his Wagons, which &s;hould haue carryed away his Am|munition, which he had rather leaue behind him then the other: for he thought it would haue bene a great di&s;honour to him, to haue lo&s;t his Canon; and the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was as well content with the match, pow|der, and &s;hot, which he left; for he had more neede of that, then of peeces.</P>
<P>And thus, Sir, haue I related the &s;iege of Hagenaw, with what followed after the rai|&s;ing of it: one part of <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Armie be|ing &s;laine in the way by the <HI>Mansfeildians,</HI> comming to releeue the Towne; others in their Trenches, by the towne Garri&s;on &s;ally|ing
<PB N="11" REF="7"> out; others drowned and &s;laine in pa&s;|&s;ing the Rhine; a &s;econd part got home with their Generall; a third part is entertai|ned by vs; and a fourth part in a weake Towne in feare of the Marckgraue of Ba|den; The Arch-Duke him&s;elfe hardly e&s;ca|ping: his whole Armie thus vtterly defea|ted, he hath no power of a while to make head againe.</P>
<P>What the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> will next doe, was not re&s;olued vpon the tenth of this mo|neth; only, that he ob&s;erues which way <HI>Tillye</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will &s;tirre, that he may (if it plea&s;e God to &s;trengthen him) be with his other enemies, as he hath beene with the <HI>Leopoldians.</HI> What next happens, you &s;hall euery weeke (if conueniencie of Me&s;|&s;engers &s;erue) be faithfully certified of God grant you heare no wor&s;e newes.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, newes was brought vs out of the Bi&s;hop of Cullens Countrie, of the braue exploits of young <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> whom the Germanes for his courage, vi|gour, and &s;pirit, call the <HI>Dul Hertzog Van
<PB N="12" REF="8"> Brun&s;wick,</HI> that is, the Mad Duke of Brun&s;|wick. This young Imp of <HI>Mars,</HI> being trai|ned vp vnder the di&s;cipline of that famous old Souldier, the Prince of Orange his kin&s;|man, as you cannot but haue heard, and be|ing brother to the pre&s;ent Duke of Brun&s;|wicke, who hauing no hope of I&s;&s;ue, this is held to bee his heyre apparent and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;our, who though he were like to be a Prince of the Empire, could not yet be di&s;couraged from this enterpri&s;e, with that vulgar feare, That if he declared him&s;elfe &s;o farre again&s;t the Emperour, that he would giue away his Dukedome, but hath vowed for his Cozens &s;ake the Queene of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> to &s;pend the la&s;t drop of his bloud. And how the Emperor is like to deale with him, you may perceiue by this pa&s;&s;age: In that the young Duke, being Bi&s;hop of Halber&s;tadt (a Common thing in Germany for Princes &s;econd brothers or &s;onnes, to get tho&s;e grea|ter Bi&s;hoprickes) the Emperour &s;ent &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners to gather vp his reuenues; Which the King of Denmarke (as tis &s;aid) hearing of, &s;ent to them, telling them, that
<PB N="13" REF="8"> his Cozen before he had engaged him&s;elfe in that action, had made ouer the profits of his Bi&s;hopricke to him, and if they did not leaue them to his ordinary Officers to receiue, he him&s;elfe would come and fetch them. But this Duke, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e feares both in the pre&s;ent and future, hath kept foule quar|ter this &s;pring in the Prince Archbi&s;hop Elect|or of Cullens Countrie, which both lay in his way, betweene the Low-Countries whence he came, and the Palatinate, whither he purpo&s;ed to march; &amp; al&s;o, this Bi&s;hop is brother to the Duke of Bauaria, to whom the King of <HI>Bohe|mia</HI> is next heyre: for tis generally held, that the Bauarian is like to leaue no i&s;&s;ue, and therefore is his brother of Cullen, though a Bi&s;hop, yet kept by di&s;pen&s;ation fro~ Rome, out of Orders, that he may marry if neede be, and &s;o to keepe the Palatinate of Bauaria from falling to the Palatinate of the Rhine, which will (and e&s;pe|cially in the&s;e times) make the <HI>Pal&s;graue</HI> too great a Prince for the Empire to endure. And the&s;e are apparent rea&s;ons of the &s;poyling of the Country, which hath beene much forra|ged and hara&s;&s;ed by the Duke of Brun&s;wick, who hath enforced the Bi&s;hop to for&s;ake his
<PB N="14" REF="9"> Countrie, and to make the very towne of Cul|len it &s;elfe to giue him Contribution to pay his Souldiers.</P>
<P>But to come to what is newly and la&s;tly done; tis &s;aid that vpon this A&s;&s;embly of Am|ba&s;&s;adors at Bruxels, who con&s;ult for a peace in the Empire, and treat about a Rendition of euery Countrie to its owne Prince; that this young Spirit was &s;ent vnto by &s;ome, to lay down his Armes while they treated of a peace: his an&s;wer was &s;aid to be to this effect; That his Armes were in his hand, and if they would haue him lay them downe, let them come and take them out of his hands: Which it &s;eemes Count <HI>Henry Vandenberg</HI> was &s;ent to do; whom <HI>Spinola</HI> &s;ent out with about 17. troupe of hor&s;e after him: who following him with long marches, and the Duke going further vp the Countrie, to finde a commodious place to encampe in, that he might not &s;eeme to flee, &s;ent word as tis &s;aid to <HI>Vandenberg,</HI> that he did not flee, but would abide him battell and fight with him: But tis generally held by good Captains, that he had beene then in great dan|ger, as hauing the Baron of Anhault, who is the Arch-bi&s;hops Generall on one &s;ide, and
<PB N="15" REF="9"> <HI>Vandenberg</HI> with his olde troupes on the other &s;ide: But that fierie &s;tratagem (of which I am &s;ure you cannot but heare better then we) of the Prince <HI>Henry</HI> of Na&s;&s;aw, in burning the Countrie about Bru&s;&s;els, euen in the &s;ight of the Arch-Duche&s;&s;e and <HI>Spinola</HI> him&s;elfe, hath deliuered him. For <HI>Spinola</HI> perceiuing this to be done by hor&s;e-men, whom he could not oppo&s;e or keepe from &s;uch another exploit, but by a power of hor&s;e, was enforced to &s;end for his hor&s;e backe to looke to all at home.</P>
<P><HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> being thus beyond expectation freed of <HI>Vandenberg,</HI> with his whole forces &s;ets vpon his other enemy the Baron of Anhalt, whom though he had &s;ometime before de|feated, yet he hoping well to enclo&s;e him be|twixt him&s;elfe and <HI>Vandenberg,</HI> was bold to make head and appeare in the field againe; but to his lo&s;&s;e againe: for the Duke ioyning bat|tell with him, ouerthrew him, and made him|&s;elfe &s;o much ma&s;ter of the field, that he had lei&s;ure both to fortifie three of the be&s;t townes thereabouts which he had taken in, and to gar|ri&s;on and victuall them; and al&s;o cleered his pa&s;&s;age towards the Palatinate, to ioyne with his Couzen the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and Count
<PB N="16" REF="10"> <HI>Mansfeild;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the people of Cullen were not altogether &s;orry for <HI>Anhalts</HI> ouerthrow; for though to the di&s;aduantage of the cau&s;e in ge|nerall <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> had made his way by the &s;word throgh their Countrie; yet for their par|ticular they could not but be glad when they heard he was pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine; for by this meanes they were freed of a powerfull and chargeable enemie; for tis reported, that he is come out of their Countrie with thirty Tunne of Dollars: him we expect daily a|mong&s;t vs; and whether the King and Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> will hold it fit to keepe him with them, they thinking they haue enough forces together already, to regaine the Palatinate; or whether they will direct him &s;ome other cour&s;e to fall vpon &s;ome other Countrie, which hath aided the Spaniards, and Baua|ria in this warre; which being mo&s;t likely, you may gue&s;&s;e as we doe. What is done I purpo&s;e to certifie you from time to time: For this Summer though it &s;hould proue as cold as the la&s;t, is likely to be heat with fire, not from the Sunne, but the Canon: and the Earth (tis feared) is like to be wet with as many &s;howers of bloud, as it was the la&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="10"> yeare with raine. God grant (if he hath ap|pointed it &s;o) that the right veine may be ope|ned: although euen all good Prote&s;tants, I hope, could de&s;ire God rather to giue vs peace then victorie.</P>
<P>Now Sir, to acquaint you briefly with the e&s;tate of e|uery particular Army about the Palatinate; The Kings Army is much encouraged by his owne per&s;onall and braue re&s;olutio~, being one &s;till him&s;elfe in all aduentures; &s;o that now tho&s;e Libellers, who after the defeat at <HI>Prague,</HI> &s;ent out a Picture of a Po&s;tillian or a Po&s;t ryding vp and downe, enquiring for the forlorne (that is, the lo&s;t) Palatine, may now finde him in the head of his Troopes; and might of late haue &s;eene him pur&s;uing his Enemies: &s;o that now the lo&s;t Palatine is found, hauing beene thus long, not &s;o much fled, as giuen way rather to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, and not hidden at the <HI>Hagh</HI> thus long; but all the while trained vp vnder that famous, great, old, &amp; experienced Soldier, his Vnckle the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> from whom he is now come to a braue Army of Twenty Thou&s;and foot, and Fiue Thou&s;and Hor&s;e well appointed, well payd, fle&s;ht in the blood of their E|nemies, Ma&s;ters of the field: and which is worth halfe an Army, led by that Generous and Victorious Count <HI>Mansfield;</HI> A man whom all the world hath giuen for lo&s;t, whom onely his owne vertue, worth and &s;pirit haue ray&s;ed to this Command and &s;ame. So that wee all here conceiue, that God hath re&s;erued him, and lifted him out of the du&s;t, meerely or mo&s;tly to &s;hew him&s;elfe
<PB N="18" REF="11"> to be the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and that it is only in his power to deliuer by the vnlikelie&s;t meanes; &s;o that wee hope, that he, who could doe thus much out of nothing, will out of thus much, doe any thing: And he is now gone out of the Palatinate, into <HI>Derm&s;tadt,</HI> an enemies Coun|trey betweene this and <HI>Franckford;</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> is the 26. of this month of May, to meet with him. What martiall exploits &s;hall next be atcheiued, the next packet &s;hall tell you. The Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden</HI> is to follow the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> with his Army within two dayes.</P>
<P>As for our Engli&s;h Companies, they are thus diuided: Noble Captaine <HI>Borroughes</HI> who &s;o brauely defended <HI>Franckendale</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> is for his good &s;eruice gouernor of the Towne, where he now is with my Lord of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Ralph Vanes</HI> Companies. Sir <HI>Gar|ret Herbert,</HI> and our famous Enginer captaine <HI>Dexter,</HI> are in <HI>Heidelbergh.</HI> My Lord Generall <HI>Vere</HI> him&s;elfe, with his owne, and &s;ixe Companies more, are in this &s;trong Towne of <HI>Manhem,</HI> which is &s;ituated vpon the&s;e two great Riuers the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Neckar,</HI> which there meet as if to make the Towne inuincible. Colonell <HI>Grayes</HI> regiment is with Count <HI>Mansfield.</HI> Now for our enemies, they are at this point: <HI>Gon&s;ales Cordoua</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ge|nerall, like an old Foxe, keepes clo&s;e in <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> which he fortifies, as if he meant rather to lurke there, then ap|peare in the field, as tis verily beleeued he purpo&s;es not to doe; His Garri&s;on at <HI>Vdenheim</HI> hath lately &s;urpri&s;ed two weake Townes, <HI>Bru&s;&s;ell,</HI> and <HI>Rottenbergh,</HI> through the negligence of the Gouernors, but they are of no im|portance.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="11">
<P>As for <HI>Tilly,</HI> hee keepes the field aboue <HI>Heidelbergh,</HI> neere vpon the <HI>Neckar,</HI> at <HI>Winxfen,</HI> where the vnfortunate battell was fought with <HI>Baden:</HI> and there hee fortifies him&s;elfe expecting &s;uccors: hee is not made &s;o much ac|count of, for one of the old Souldiers <HI>Spaniards, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Wallons</HI> in <HI>Cordovaes</HI> Regiment, are held worth two of his <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and for all him, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is gone into <HI>Derm&s;tadt.</HI> And this is the e&s;tate of our Enemies. From other parts wee heare that <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> is almo&s;t in a readines, and altogether in a re&s;olution to march hitherward, with the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iegeren&s;dorff,</HI> and the Count de <HI>Tourne,</HI> &s;o that here wee hope &s;hortly to haue better conditions offred vs.</P>
<P>And thus Sir, I end a long letter, wherin I haue dilated the di&s;cour&s;e, by attempting to giue the rea&s;ons of each motion, and to de&s;cribe the per&s;ons and places, to giue light to the &s;torie, which you &s;hall doe well to keepe by you, for it will make you the better to vnder&s;tand what&s;oeuer &s;hall be writ|ten of the&s;e Wars.</P>
