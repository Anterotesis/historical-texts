<HEAD>An hi&s;toricall and true di&s;cour&s;e of a voyage made by the Admirall <HI>Cornelis Matelief the younger, into the Ea&s;t Indies, who departed out of Holland in May, Anno.</HI> 1605.</HEAD>
<P>_IN regard that wee began our voyage &s;ome-what too late in the yeare, it fell out to be &s;o much the longer, (as I wrote vnto your wor&s;hips in Ianuary la&s;t, from the Iland <HI>Mau|ritio,</HI> by the Admirall <HI>Ste|uen vander Haghen:</HI>) from whence we departed the 27. of Ianuary, and fear|ing the pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e &s;hallow places, wee cau&s;ed our Pinna&s;&s;es or &s;mall boates to &s;ayle before, and in the night time to hang out Lanthornes, by which meanes wee got ouer the flats of <HI>Nazare,</HI> ouer the North point called <HI>Haya de Mal&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Perodes Ban|hos,</HI> and made toward <HI>Chagros,</HI> but could not get the|ther by the North, and therefore tooke our cour&s;e Southerly, and found no ground: from thence wee pa&s;t betweene <HI>Pulo Malueo,</HI> and the <HI>Maldiues,</HI> but &s;aw no land vntill the two and twenty of March, yet wee
<PB N="2" REF="3">e&s;pied the Iland of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which is the point of <HI>Achin,</HI> but could not reach it.</P>
<P>The 28. of Ianuary wee drew neere to the <HI>Nico|bares,</HI> where wee tooke in fre&s;h water, and got &s;ome <HI>Coques</HI> Nuttes, and a few Hennes, in which place the inhabitants goe altogether naked: there I thought to haue gotten &s;ome Amber, which if I had &s;tayed there, I might haue got for fiue blankes. There our men went on &s;hoare, and hauing mu&s;tered, prepared &s;ome in&s;truments of wood which I as then wanted.</P>
<P>At which time our &s;ouldiers and Sailers, de&s;iring to know to what parts they were bound (for that as then they began to murmure among&s;t them-&s;elues, &s;aying, that they were not hyred to fight on land (and &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t Sailers &s;toutly maintained it.) I &s;hewed them that the &s;tates commi&s;&s;aries Commi&s;|&s;ion giuen vnto me, was to be&s;iege and win the towne of <HI>Malacca,</HI> &s;etting before their eyes what honor and great profit they were to expect from thence, toge|ther with the &s;mall perill which they had to incurre: &s;aying, that I would &s;end them to no other place, but where I would hazard mine owne life with them, promi&s;ing them that if they chanced to winne the towne by force of a&s;&s;ault, they &s;hould haue the ran|&s;acking thereof, and if that they got it by treatie and compo&s;ition, they &s;hould likewi&s;e haue that they found therein, re&s;eruing &s;ome part thereof to fortifie the towne withall, wherewith they were much incou|raged, and re&s;olutely with one voyce, cryed out and &s;ayd, that they were fully re&s;olued to win the towne,
<PB N="3" REF="3">and with that re&s;olution wee &s;ayled through the Straights: and vpon the la&s;t of Aprill, arriued within halfe a mile of <HI>Malacca,</HI> with the lo&s;&s;e of two men onely, that dyed by the way.</P>
<P>And being come before <HI>Malacca,</HI> I commanded that foure &s;hips that lay in the road, (whereof one was laden for <HI>China,</HI>) &s;hould bee &s;et on fire, but my com|mi&s;&s;ion being not ob&s;erued, my men giuing them|&s;elues to drinking, they let them make away, where they had three men &s;laine, and fifteene wounded: but I willed them onely to burne them, and not to ran|&s;ake them.</P>
<P>The next day after we con&s;ulted about our landing (for that order had beene taken long before how wee &s;hould land, and what euery man &s;hould doe) &s;ome were of opinion to land pre&s;ently, others &s;aid that it was not expedient for vs to land &s;o ha&s;tily in a &s;trange countrey, not knowing the enemies forces, and that it was be&s;t for vs to &s;tay the comming of the King of <HI>Ihor</HI> that was looked for within eight or ten dayes, for wee perceiued a wood neere vnto the &s;hore, much to the enemies aduantage to play vpon vs from thence, we not being able to pur&s;ue them, and there|fore alledged that they thought it not good to put the whole Fleete in danger, before the comming of the King of <HI>Ihor:</HI> who being arriued with two or three thou&s;and men, they &s;ayd wee might land boldly, and put our enemy in great feare: this was the iudgment of the greater part of vs, which did preuaile, though I my &s;elfe liked better of our pre&s;ent landing.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>The eight of May we landed with the King of <HI>Ihor,</HI> (who had about three thou&s;and men with him,) and in our landing lo&s;t not one man; for the <HI>Portugales</HI> be|ing two or three hundred, that &s;tood ready on the &s;hore to re&s;i&s;t vs, &s;uddenly retired into the &s;uburbes of the towne, where they defended them&s;elues till mid night, and then &s;etting them on fire, and breaking the bridge, ranne into the towne. In my adui&s;e &s;ent vnto the Commi&s;&s;aries, I haue declared what I haue done before <HI>Malacca,</HI> vntill the eight of Augu&s;t, and what &s;mall ayde and a&s;&s;i&s;tance we haue receiued from the <HI>Ihorites,</HI> with the di&s;order and mutiny of our peo|ple, the &s;trength of the towne, their &s;allies out again&s;t vs, and how they haue with credit beene driuen back againe by vs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At &s;uch time as we intended to remooue our &s;iege, in regarde that the Portingales <HI>Armado</HI> as then laye hard by <HI>Capo Rachado,</HI> which is about twelue miles from <HI>Malacca:</HI> they of <HI>Malacca</HI> thought verily eyther to &s;poile vs, or to hinder our pretence (they of <HI>Mal|leyc</HI> being all gone aboorde, except a hundred and twenty, or a hunderd and thirty men,) and i&s;&s;uing out of the towne with all the men they could make, &s;et vpon vs, but we couragiou&s;ly draue them back againe, with the lo&s;&s;e of fifty of their men, and but one man of ours hurt.</P>
<P>This done, for the &s;pace of two nights I was much troubled about &s;hipping of our Ordnance, in regarde that the &s;treame was not &s;wift, whereby the water could not get to the &s;hore, &amp; the ground very muddy,
<PB N="5" REF="4">&s;o that I could hardly get our Canon aboord, but God prouided &s;o well for vs, that vpon the 16. day we all got aboord, and left not any thing on the &s;hoare, hauing about three hundred hurt and &s;icke men a|mong&s;t vs. Notwith&s;tanding the 17. of Augu&s;t we &s;et forward to encounter our enimy, who&s;e Fleete was 14. Galions, 4. Galleys, and 15. or 16. Fu&s;tes or Fri|gates, and two or three Galions, came two or three dayes after vnto their Fleete: that euening we &s;hotte again&s;t them, and cha&s;ed them, but in the night they put on more &s;ailes, and wee following after them all the next day, holding our cour&s;e Northerly. The next night following I layd mee downe to &s;leepe, for I had taken no re&s;t in three dayes and three nights before, beeing much bu&s;ied about our Ordinance: In the meane time <HI>Dyrick Mol</HI> mai&s;ter of my &s;hip came vnto me, &s;hewing me that the enemy out-&s;ailed vs, asking me whether wee &s;hould put on any more &s;ailes, I an|&s;wered, yea; and willed him at any hand to keepe them &s;till in fight. Not long after that he came againe, and tolde mee that the enemy had ca&s;t Anchor, wher|vpon I charged him to Anchor al&s;o, and to keepe aboue the winde: The re&s;t of our &s;hips anchred loofe|ward, a Canon &s;hot wide from the enemy. In the mor|ning before the breake of day, I cau&s;ed a peece to bee &s;hotte off, to warne to &s;et &s;aile, for as then the enemy had gotten &s;ome-what more, and had the loofe of vs: and at the &s;ame time al&s;o &s;hotte off a warning peece vnto his &s;hippe. Our &s;hippe called the <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> was long winding vp of her Anchor; and before I could
<PB N="6" REF="5">make &s;ignes vnto her to cut the cable, a <HI>Portugall</HI> &s;hip aborded her, which I perceiuing, wound my &s;hippe about to ayde her, but the Sea was &s;o calme, that I could not reache her, but by force borded <HI>Simon Man,</HI> and could by no meanes get from him. The Admirall <HI>Alioza de Caruailla,</HI> &s;eeing vs fa&s;t together, boorded <HI>Symon Mau,</HI> and <HI>Henrico de Loroinge</HI> boorded mee, (the&s;e two were the greate&s;t Gallions the enemy had): after that came <HI>Duarte de Guerra,</HI> and fell al&s;o vpon mee, where-with wee gaue fire on all &s;ides, at which encounter mo&s;t part of <HI>Duarte de Guerras</HI> men were kild, and hee him&s;elfe al&s;o: <HI>Alioza de Caruailla</HI> for&s;ooke his &s;hip, and was likewi&s;e &s;laine: <HI>Don Henri|co</HI> receiued more then a hundred &s;hottes thorough his &s;hip.</P>
<P>Afterwards <HI>Claes Gherrit&s;z</HI> Mai&s;ter of the <HI>Mauri|tius,</HI> fell vpon <HI>Duarte de Guerra,</HI> and &s;et her on fire, whereby our blind al&s;o was &s;et on fire: the other <HI>Por|tugall</HI> &s;hips would haue &s;et vpon vs, but dur&s;t not for the fire, meane time I ca&s;t out an Anchor which was cut off by my men, but they &s;ayd that it was done by the fire. The <HI>Mauritius</HI> loo&s;ed him&s;elfe, &amp; <HI>Simon Man</HI> of <HI>Middleborough</HI> draue from vs, with <HI>Duarte de Guer|ra,</HI> and <HI>Alioza de Caruailla,</HI> but the people for the mo&s;t part were all &s;laine, I hauing ca&s;t out another Anchor, called vnto them to ca&s;t one of their Cables vnto vs to &s;tay them, but the noy&s;e was &s;o great that they heard vs not, &s;o that they burnt all together. <HI>Simon Mau</HI> &s;aued the mo&s;t part of his men, except eigh|teene that were hurt, and &s;ome that were taken
<PB N="7" REF="5">pri&s;oners, that were afterwards relea&s;ed by my meanes. I was &s;till fa&s;t grapled to <HI>Henrico,</HI> to whom I promi&s;d his life if hee would yeeld, (for hee could not defend him&s;elfe, which hee promi&s;ed to doe, ma|ny of his men being very de&s;irous to come ouer into our &s;hip, but I refu&s;ed them (yet twelue of them came aboord) fearing that my men would fall to the &s;poile, for they had twi&s;e more men then wee, and our anchor would not hold, and &s;till the enemyes fleete approached, wee beeing very weary, my Mai|&s;ter and my Captaine beeing &s;laine, and the chiefe Marchant hurt, whereof not long after hee dyed, and I was forced to bee pre&s;ent at euery conflict. Whervpon I commanded <HI>Don Henrico</HI> to ca&s;t out an|chor, but hee excu&s;ed him&s;elfe, &s;aying, that hee was not able to doe it, for which cau&s;e I &s;ent a man to looke whether it were &s;o or not, which gaue him&s;elfe to the &s;poyle; then I &s;ent an other that tooke the mai&s;ters Whi&s;tle from his necke, but comming back againe, &s;ayd that the &s;hippe was full of dead men, and that the anchors were lo&s;t, and the cables &s;hotte in peeces, by the Canon &s;hotte. Where-vpon I cau&s;ed a Rope to bee brought out at the Sterne, to fa&s;ten it vnto vs. In the meane time our anchor tooke holde, and his &s;hip brake from vs, and &s;o I lo&s;t my prize: which &s;hewes that they which make many delayes, are often di&s;appointed, &s;o that it &s;eemes that mar&s;hall affaires mu&s;t bee vndertaken with quick and &s;peedy re&s;olution. This grieued vs much, but there was no remedie: This happened about euening.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>One of the enemies &s;hips al&s;o boorded the <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> at which time al&s;o their Vice-roy fell vpon him on the other &s;ide, but could not winne him, and therefore &s;et the Gallery, and the Sterne of her on fire, and &s;o &s;hee was burnt, the Vice-roy likewi&s;e had been burnt with her if the Galleyes had not pluckt him away by force.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of the <HI>Na&s;&s;aus</HI> men were &s;aued: <HI>Mauritius</HI> and the <HI>Black Lion</HI> thought to haue falne vpon the Viceroy; but the winde was too calme, the re&s;t of our &s;hips did their endeuours, but there were &s;ome faint-hearted among&s;t them, notwith&s;tanding wee held out, and fought all that day, although vnfor|tunately with lo&s;&s;e of two &s;hips on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The next day being the nineteene of Augu&s;t, all our &s;hips being repayred, wee re&s;olued to recouer our lo&s;&s;es, for the which wee were much grieued, but if the <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> had cut her Anchors in time, wee had not boorded one the other, and it had fallen out better for vs.</P>
<P>The twentieth of Augu&s;t wee fell to it againe, al|though I found not my men &s;o ready and re&s;olute as before, for tho&s;e that had e&s;caped out of the &s;hippes that were burnt, e&s;pecially they of <HI>Middleborough,</HI> asked mee where they &s;hould haue their moneths pay, wherevnto I an&s;wered, that it was then no time to &s;peake of &s;uch matters; and that I knew not how the Commi&s;&s;aries would vnder&s;tand the&s;e things, and yet I &s;ayd I was informed that they had beha|ued them&s;elues valiantly, and that therefore it was
<PB N="9" REF="6">no rea&s;on but that they &s;hould haue their due, and that to my power I would defend and maintaine them in all iu&s;t cau&s;es. Within an houre after, the men of my &s;hip al&s;o came vnto mee, and demanded &s;ecurity for their moneths pay; or el&s;e they &s;aid they would not fight: they had &s;ome &s;etters on, which as yet I dare not name. This made mee halfe aba&s;ht, yet I v&s;ed all the meanes that I could po&s;&s;ible to ap|pea&s;e them, and at the la&s;t they &s;eemed to bee con|tented.</P>
<P>About the euening wee approched the enemy a|gaine, and then I fir&s;t ob&s;erued what danger the words (of re&s;pectiue &s;hips) &s;et downe in our Arti|cles brought vs into: for by meanes of the lo&s;&s;e of the two &s;hippes afore&s;aid, euery one drew back from ioyning with the enemy, beeing lothe to v&s;e his hy|poteke or a&s;&s;urance, whereby wee were not halfe &s;o forward to &s;et vpon our enemy as wee were at the fir&s;t; for not &s;o much as a Swabber in the &s;hippe but hee would di&s;pute vpon the wordes of Re&s;pectiue &s;hips, for whereas it is &s;ayd, that for the a&s;&s;urance of their pay, they &s;hall haue the &s;hip wherein they &s;erued, and the goods that were in it and no more, euery one was carefull for his owne.</P>
<P>That day and the next wee &s;hotte diuers times at the Viceroy, but I perceiuing that wee had not pow|der enough to ouer-come &s;uch an army, nor bullets to &s;erue our turnes, though I had cau&s;ed &s;ome to bee made before <HI>Malacca;</HI> but not &s;ufficient, wee left off.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P>The &s;hipps that &s;tayde behinde came neere vnto the enemy, that had his rowing Pinna&s;&s;es, where|with hee could fetch water when hee would, and in our &s;ight carryed his hurt men to <HI>Malacca,</HI> where|vpon wee called a coun&s;ell together, and re&s;olued to goe to <HI>Ihor,</HI> chiefly to relea&s;e our &s;hips, for it &s;ee|med that our enemy could &s;ayle better then wee, as al&s;o to refre&s;h out &s;icke men, to make Bullets, and to incourage the King: this wee performed at <HI>Ihor,</HI> which hath one of the be&s;t riuers of the world: there wee made Bullets, but could get but little refre&s;hing for money, I al&s;o incouraged the King of <HI>Ihor,</HI> coun|&s;elling him to fortifie his towne, and &s;hewed him how hee &s;hould doe it, which at la&s;t was begunne, and had &s;oone beene fini&s;hed, if the Hollanders would haue wrought.</P>
<P>Wee departed thence the thirteene of October, and the twentith came before <HI>Malacca,</HI> and for the &s;pace of &s;ixe dayes laye in &s;ight of the Towne, but could not approach neere vnto it by rea&s;on of the winde, &s;o that the enemy placed all his &s;hipps, being &s;eauen Galeons and three Galleys (for the fourth was &s;hotte to peeces by <HI>Capo Rachado</HI>) in a rowe, and all his Canon on the one &s;ide. Wee there-vpon taking coun&s;ell re&s;olued to &s;et vpon the enemy, but becau&s;e wee had little proui&s;ion of pouder, and a long iour|ney to make home-ward, and perceiuing that wee could not &s;eperate their &s;hippes with &s;hooting, wee agreed that three of our &s;hips &s;hould boord them, which I thought to haue done in the night time,
<PB N="11" REF="7">taking with mee the <HI>Sunne,</HI> and the <HI>Froninee</HI> of <HI>Del&s;e,</HI> but could not by rea&s;on of the &s;treame: the morning beeing coole and cleere, and fitte to take &s;ome-thing in hand, the winde comming from the land, and wee lying Northerly from the roade, wee made &s;aile, mea|ning to fall vpon their &s;hippe that lay mo&s;t Southerly and mo&s;t beneath the &s;treame, for the water began to turne, but the winde was &s;o &s;harpe, that I could &s;cant pa&s;&s;e by the roade, &s;o that wee approached neere to <HI>Illa das noas,</HI> and woond about it, but could not &s;et vp|on any of them, but vpon that which laye Norther|lie&s;t (which was the greate&s;t Gallion next vnto the Vice-royes, and had in her nineteene Bra&s;&s;e peeces, and three Yron peeces, a hundred and three &s;core <HI>Portingales,</HI> and as many <HI>Moores</HI> (I willed my mai&s;ter called <HI>Symon Lambrecht&s;z Man,</HI> whom I had taken in|to my &s;hip, in the &s;teed of <HI>Dirick Mol</HI> that was &s;laine, to &s;et vpon her. Wee were forced to pa&s;&s;e by all the &s;hippes of the enemy, not without &s;ome hurt vnto vs, but I &s;hotte not at all, re&s;cuing euery thing ready vntill our aboording, but when wee were halfe way forward among&s;t the enemies &s;hips, my Mai&s;ter and the Pylote coun&s;elled mee to turne our cour&s;e, to who~ I made an&s;wer, that I wanted no adui&s;e nor coun|&s;aile, to delay them of till wee were aboord the Gal|lion, and &s;o held on vntill we boorded her, and &s;o let a Dragge fall, appointing ten Mu&s;quetters to keepe it, and to hinder that the enemy &s;hould not loo&s;e it, which the enemy &s;ought to doe: I willed them al&s;o to &s;hoote continually towards their <HI>Mer&s;ch,</HI> and from
<PB N="12" REF="8">our Mer&s;ch and garnates, I cau&s;ed &s;tones and fire-balles to bee ca&s;t, whereby the enimie was driuen vnder his net. And as &s;oone as I had fa&s;tned vppon him, the <HI>Sunne</HI> fell on his other &s;ide, and the <HI>Prouince</HI> came behinde vs, and brake his Spritt again&s;t the enemies &s;hippes, the Galion had an anchor before the flood, and a cable fa&s;tned at the Vice-royes &s;hip, but the cable was pre&s;ently cutte in peeces, as al|&s;o the cable that fa&s;tened the Viceroy vnto him, and &s;o wee draue together towards the Lee: the other <HI>Portugales</HI> perceiuing that, hoy&s;ed their &s;ailes (which was that which I aymed at, to drawe them from the wall,) and made to &s;ea-ward. Wee fell vp|on the Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and killed all the men, except eight <HI>Portingalles,</HI> that hidde them-&s;elues vnder the Balla&s;t, and &s;o wee tooke her.</P>
<P>My Mai&s;ter and the Pilote &s;ayd, that it was not expedient that two of our &s;hippes &s;hould be bound to one &s;hippe, and that wee &s;hould leaue the <HI>Sunne</HI> alone with it, and fall vpon the Viceroy that drew neere vnto vs, which coun&s;ell I liked not, fearing to haue the like chance that I had with <HI>Henrico.</HI></P>
<P>A little while after <HI>Roobol</HI> Mai&s;ter of the great <HI>Sunne,</HI> called vnto mee, to pray mee to let him alone in the &s;hippe, and that hee would carry it to the Sea, which I would not con&s;ent vnto, but per|ceiuing that I could not doe any thing to my minde, I leaft it: and pre&s;ently the weather was very calme, the <HI>Portingales</HI> &s;hippes laye loofe-ward from vs, whereof one made towards the great <HI>Sunne,</HI> but
<PB N="13" REF="8">hee could not, fearing to be clapt on boord by vs, we perceiuing that the calme either hindred vs to come togither; I &s;ent a boate to <HI>Roobol</HI> willing him to &s;et fire in the &s;hippe, where vnto hee an&s;wered that I &s;hould hold my peace, and &s;ayd hee would not do it, in the meane time hee got him-&s;elfe loo&s;e, by what meanes I know not, and hoy&s;ing vp his great &s;ayle, ranne more then a myle from the Fleete not once looking backe: In the meane while two Portingale &s;hippes boorded the Vize-admirall, again&s;t whome came <HI>Mauritius</HI> and the Blacke Lion, and behaued them|&s;elues &s;o well, that the one of th'enemies &s;hippes was burnt, and the other &s;poyled. The <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;et vppon a portingale, but they were pre&s;ently &s;epa|rated againe, and I &s;ayling by him willed him to bord him againe, which he did, but they were pre&s;ent|ly &s;eperated againe. The great calme hindred mee that I could not come neere them: after that a whirle|winde ry&s;ing, &s;cattered the &s;hippes; and with that <HI>Mauritius</HI> made towards the Portingale againe, <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> and I al&s;o turning towards him, which the Portingale perceiuing, yeelded vnto vs, where wee killed foure and forty Portingales, and tooke out of her eight peeces of bra&s;&s;e, and &s;o &s;et fire on hir. In the &s;hippe which the Vize-admirall burnt there was not &s;o much as a catte or a dogge &s;aued: The &s;hippe that <HI>Roobol</HI> did let go, was driuen by the Gallies to the &s;hoare, and &s;o the euening came vp|pon vs.</P>
<P>The next morning, the Vizeroys &s;hippe lying
<PB N="14" REF="9">formo&s;t, I made towards him, but my Mai&s;ter and Pilot tolde mee that I could not reach him; for which cau&s;e I made to the Galion Saint <HI>Symon,</HI> that yeelded it &s;elfe vnto mee, for the men were mo&s;t of them runne from him: the Captaine with twenty men onely remaining in her: out of her I tooke foureteene peeces, &s;ome fle&s;h, wine, and pou|der, and &s;o &s;et it on fire.</P>
<P>This (thankes bee vnto GOD) was the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e of our battaile, without any great lo&s;&s;e of men, wee burnt three Gallions, wherein many Gen|tlemen were &s;laine, and aboue foure hundred <HI>Portin|gale</HI> &s;ouldiers, as I was after informed by certaine intercepted letters; wee our &s;elues made our vic|tory bloudy, for our men were &s;o diuili&s;hly giuen &s;o &s;eeke after prey and bootie, that rowing round about the Gallion that burnt, they fell to ran&s;ack|ing the men that &s;wum in the water, whereby the fire got into the powder, and burnt three of our boates, wherein wee lo&s;t foure and twenty men of the <HI>White Lyon,</HI> eighteene of the <HI>Black Lion,</HI> eleuen of the <HI>Vice-Admirall,</HI> &s;eauen of the <HI>Prouince,</HI> and fiue of the great <HI>Sunne.</HI> God forgiue them their ouer-&s;ight.</P>
<P>The eight and twentie day wee went againe to|wards <HI>Malacca;</HI> intending to burne the <HI>Vice-roy</HI> and the <HI>Paule,</HI> but as wee had concluded the euening before to performe it: the next morning the <HI>Vice-roy</HI> him&s;elfe cau&s;ed fire to bee put into three of the Gallions, &s;o great was their feare: I
<PB N="51" REF="9">&s;eeing that pre&s;ently retired, thinking them to bee fire &s;hippes &s;ent for to burne vs.</P>
<P>After that I made agreement to relea&s;e the Portingales, that were in all a hundred &s;eauenty fiue, and as many Moores, vppon condition that the Viceroy &s;hould &s;end mee all my Duch-men that were pri&s;oners in <HI>Mallacca,</HI> and that hee had in any place within the <HI>Indies;</HI> and that three Captaines, <HI>Christianus Swarez, Andreas Pe&s;o,</HI> and <HI>Ferdinando Marcado,</HI> &s;hould pay fiue thou&s;and Ducats for their ran&s;ome, which &s;hould bee de|uided among&s;t our men.</P>
<P>Which accordingly was performed, be&s;ide a thou&s;and Ducats which are not yet payd, for two Portingales, whereof one left his brother with me in ho&s;tage: This money I deuided among&s;t the Saylers, euery one hauing fiue ryals of eight, (for the Ducats make but &s;ixe ryals) to make them the willinger to &s;ette vppon the re&s;t of the Armado that was gone to <HI>Ni&s;obaer.</HI> The chiefe thing wor|thy the noting was that when I came the &s;econd time within the &s;ight of <HI>Mallacca,</HI> there ro&s;e a mu|tinie in &s;ome of the &s;hips &s;aying that they would not fight, and alledging that they entred not into &s;eruice to that end, &s;aying that it was true that they had made me a promi&s;e to make a triall vpon <HI>Ni&s;obaer</HI> but that they &s;aid was performed before <HI>Mallacca:</HI> and al&s;o at <HI>Capo Rachado,</HI> as they &s;up|po&s;ed: the mo&s;t part of them yeelded to rea|&s;on, but tho&s;e of the Vice-Admirall &s;aid they
<PB N="16" REF="10">would giue eare to nothing, &s;o that I was forced to v&s;e &s;ome threatning wordes, and &s;ayd that for all their deniall the matter &s;hould not goe as they would haue it, and &s;o willing, nilling, they went on with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus I went with all the &s;hippes to <HI>Ni&s;obaer,</HI> though I intended to haue &s;ent the <HI>White-Lyon</HI> and the <HI>Vice-admirall</HI> toward; <HI>Bantham,</HI> there to take in their lading, and the next yeare to bee at home: but the mo&s;t voyces would haue vs all to goe to|gether to <HI>Ni&s;obaer,</HI> and to trie whether wee could &s;eperat their &s;hippes, which wee hoped to finde all di&s;per&s;ed, as al&s;o to get the King of <HI>Queda</HI> on our &s;ide, to the end that no victuals &s;hould bee carried from thence to <HI>Malacca,</HI> and &s;o wee came before <HI>Queda.</HI></P>
<P>The nineteene of Nouember I offered my &s;er|uice vnto the King, &s;howing him that I was come thether to helpe him for to driue the <HI>Portingales</HI> out of his dominions, and to cha&s;e them from his Hauen, according to his letters written vnto mee, and &s;ent to <HI>Bata&s;aner,</HI> and that I was de&s;irous to lade a &s;hippe there, becau&s;e his name was not yet knowne in our countrey, which I &s;ayd would tend vnto his honor and profit. The King glad to heare that, prayed mee to helpe him to take a <HI>Pourtu|gale</HI> &s;hippe and two Fregattes that laye in the ri|uer: Where-vpon I pre&s;ently &s;ent three Boates that the &s;ame night &s;et tho&s;e three &s;hippes on fire, after that the <HI>Maleyes</HI> had taken the goods un|wares
<PB N="17" REF="10">out of them, for I charged my men to take nothing from thence, there I tooke a praw com|ming from <HI>Malacca,</HI> and therein &s;ome letters, con|taining that their <HI>Armado</HI> was not farre from <HI>Pau|lo Bouton,</HI> and meant to &s;ayle to the <HI>Indies</HI> the fourth of December: therfore I made ha&s;t to follow them, before that the foure Fregattes with a hundred and foure and twentie men and munition of warre, &s;hould come vnto them, and ioyne with them.</P>
<P>The ninth of December wee gotte to <HI>Paulo Bouton,</HI> and &s;aw the <HI>Armado,</HI> which no &s;ooner per|ceiued vs, but they retyred to a place where they had &s;treame and winde to their aduantage, and made them&s;elues fa&s;t with foure cables before and behinde, and with a cable that reached from the one &s;hippe to the other, and laye in &s;uch manner that wee could not come neere vnto them, vnle&s;&s;e wee would winde our &s;elues on boord of them in the night, I &s;ent diuer&s;e &s;hippes vnto them, but could doe nothing. Then wee prepared a fire &s;hip, thinking vnder the &s;hotte of our Cannon to gette neere them, but it would not bee: they had placed all their Canon on the one &s;ide, and in the mid&s;t all along their &s;hippes they had layd Trees and Pipes filde vp with &s;and, and had in-&s;con&s;ed them-&s;elues in &s;uch manner, that they could turne and winde their &s;hippes as they would, and di&s;charge their Cannon at their plea&s;ures, hauing a Northerlie winde that blew &s;trongly out of the valleys, &s;o that wee &s;ought to get neere vnto them.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="11">
<P>When wee came towards the point of the land, it was there calme vnder the high land, and com|ming neere vnto them, the winde blew out of the Valleys, &s;o that if wee would boord them, wee could not, vnle&s;&s;e we would burne our &s;elues with them, which they de&s;ire, (as it appeareth by the letters of the Vice-roy) for they make their rec|koning that they haue wone victory enough if by burning of two of their &s;hippes, they burne one of ours: for the King cares not for his &s;hippes, &s;o he may thereby finde the meanes to hinder the Hollanders from their Nauigation.</P>
<P>It was not good for vs to &s;tay there any longer, for euery day wee lo&s;t our anchors, &s;o that our re&s;olution was to go to <HI>Pulo Lankeui,</HI> where they mu&s;t of force &s;tay, if they would goe for <HI>Mallacca,</HI> that &s;o we might &s;et vpon them in the maine Sea. The twentith day lying vnder <HI>Lankeui,</HI> &s;ixe miles from <HI>Poulo Bouton,</HI> wee determined to &s;end the white Lyon to <HI>Queda</HI> to &s;ee if &s;he might get three or four hundred bales of Pepper there, becau&s;e at <HI>Dachin</HI> &s;hee &s;hould finde lading enough to &s;erue her turne: But they could get nothing in <HI>Queda:</HI> For when they begin to gather the new Pepper, the old is gone, which is worth foure and twenty ryalls in <HI>Co&s;gie,</HI> and in <HI>Ihor,</HI> and &s;o went to the re&s;t of our &s;hips againe, lying vnder <HI>Pulo Lankeui</HI> to watch for the Portingales.</P>
<P>The nine and twentith day the King of <HI>Queda</HI> (after that I burnt the Portugales &s;hippes in his
<PB N="19" REF="11">Riuer) cau&s;ed twenty Portugales to bee kild, thinking &s;o to doe mee a great plea&s;ure therein, becau&s;e I had &s;ent him word that hee &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome &s;ignes by his actions, that I might conceiue him to be my good friend. Your Wor|&s;hippes may iudge hereby what affection hee beareth vnto the Portugales: From thence there is nothing to bee brought away but Pepper and victuals, whereby tho&s;e of <HI>Mallacca</HI> are &s;u&s;tai|ned: this people alwaies hold with the &s;tronger part. In the deliuering of the Portingale pri&s;o|ners vnto the Vice roy before <HI>Mallacca,</HI> I had like to haue bene betrayed, for whereas I was &s;o liberal that I gaue a hundred and &s;eauenty Portingales, and as many Moores, for fiue or &s;ixe of my men which they had (but I re&s;erued the Captaines and three or foure more for to get the three thou&s;and ducats afore-&s;aid) I &s;ent a note by a Portingale on &s;hoare, to will the Vice-roy to &s;end mee my men, and I would &s;end him all his &s;oldiers hole and di&s;|&s;ea&s;ed, which if hee refu&s;ed and held mee in &s;u&s;|pence, I &s;aid I would ca&s;t all the Portingales ouer|boord, he returned with a note, whereby the Vice|roy willed me to &s;end him the Portingales, &amp; &s;ent me a bill of all their names both &s;oldiers &amp; Cap|taines &amp; all others that were in my hands, &amp; when my me&s;&s;e~ger &s;hewed me that the pri&s;oners were in danger of their liues; <HI>Andrew Hurtado</HI> made an&s;wer let him kill them, the re&s;t will fight better an o|ther time, which whe~ I vnder&s;tood, I returned the me&s;&s;enger pre&s;ently againe with this an&s;wer that
<PB N="20" REF="12">if in the morning before Sunne ri&s;ing hee did not &s;end mee all my Duch men I would kill all the Portingales; for I perceiued that the Viceroy de|laid mee off; hee returning brought with him three Duch-men, for there were no more in the towne, the re&s;t were in the <HI>Armado</HI> at <HI>Poulo Bouton:</HI> which hee promi&s;ed to &s;end, meane time I had call'd a Councell togither, and my white flagge hung out, and certainly if hee had &s;taid but two houres longer, the&s;e hundred and &s;eauenty Por|tingales had beene ca&s;t ouer-boord, for a war|ning vnto them, not to mocke with vs another time, for when they haue their de&s;ires, they &s;coffe at vs, and e&s;teeme vs to bee men that know not the cour&s;e of the world, and that dare not (be|cau&s;e of the reuerence wee beare vnto them) of|fend them any-way, and thus the boa&s;t before the <HI>Indian</HI> Princes.</P>
<P>I thought to haue &s;ent a letter to the Viceroy, but deferr'd it for certaine cau&s;es, vntill &s;ome fitter time, to let him vnder&s;tand that wee intended to make warre-like &s;oldiers, and that if hee would deale hardlyer with my men that hee &s;hould take, then I had hether to done with his, hee would find him&s;elfe greatly deceiued, and that if he thought to &s;toppe my mouth with the Inqui&s;ition and &s;uch like ma&s;querados, and &s;o keepe and con&s;ume my men in his country, &s;aying that hee could doe no|thing again&s;t th'Inqui&s;ition, I and tho&s;e that &s;hal come after mee to the <HI>Indies,</HI> would make warre
<PB N="21" REF="12">again&s;t th'Inqui&s;ition, and ca&s;t all their &s;haueling Fryers ouer-boord, which would concerne the Inqui&s;ition and not him. May it therefore plea&s;e the States to take &s;uch order that the&s;e fel|lowes may no longer terrifie vs with their viz|ards: And thus much I cau&s;ed to bee &s;ayd vnto the Viceroy him-&s;elfe by the Captaines that were pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Meane time I &s;ent a <HI>Praw</HI> from <HI>Queda</HI> to <HI>Pulo Lankeui</HI> with one of my men in it, to &s;ee whether the enemie lay &s;till at <HI>Poulo-bouton,</HI> who returned an&s;wer the nine and twentith day, that they were yet there, and brought two boyes pri&s;oners with him, that tolde mee that they had &s;ent a <HI>Galliot</HI> to <HI>Mallacca</HI> to haue adui&s;e from the <HI>Viceroy,</HI> to know what they &s;hould do, whither they &s;hold re|turne to the <HI>Indies</HI> or to <HI>Mallacca,</HI> for they dur&s;t not leaue their aduantage, without command: they &s;aid al&s;o, that when I thought to haue &s;et on them with the fire-&s;hippe and &s;hotte vppon them, that twenty men were kild in the Admirall, &s;eauen in <HI>Iohn Pintos</HI> &s;hippe, and eight in <HI>Iacomo de Ma|raris</HI> his cou&s;ins &s;hippe wherein they went, but what was done in the other &s;hippes they knew not.</P>
<P>I perceiuing that there was no lading at <HI>Queda,</HI> and that the enemy would not leaue his place of aduantage, and that my time drew neere to go to the <HI>Molucques,</HI> dur&s;t not &s;tay any longer, for
<PB N="22" REF="13"><HI>Amboine</HI> was of force to be fortified, whil&s;t <HI>Ternate</HI> was taken in by tho&s;e of <HI>Manilles,</HI> where the Gouernor <HI>Don Pedro de Sou&s;a</HI> with a thou&s;and two hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> and eight hundred <HI>Indians</HI> was come, and had taken the King pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Therefore wee concluded, that the <HI>Vice-admirall</HI> with the <HI>White Lyon,</HI> and the great <HI>Sunne,</HI> &s;hould goe for <HI>Achin,</HI> to &s;ee if they by any meanes could make the like agreement with the King, as wee had made with the King of <HI>Ihor,</HI> and to giue the <HI>White Lion</HI> her full lading, and &s;o &s;end her home|ward, as al&s;o for to take in his owne lading if hee might, if not to goe pre&s;ently for <HI>Bantam,</HI> and there to take in their lading, and &s;o to returne home-ward, if hee could bee ready again&s;t the la&s;t of February, or the middle of March at the fur|the&s;t, and to &s;end the great <HI>Sunne</HI> to the coa&s;tes of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> but fir&s;t to &s;aile by <HI>Puncto de Galli</HI> vnder <HI>Celon,</HI> and there to trafficke and &s;tay vntill the la&s;t of February, looking for the &s;hippes of <HI>Bengale,</HI> and other places, which at that very time came from <HI>Couchien,</HI> and then were to goe to|wards <HI>Ma&s;olipatan,</HI> hoping that they &s;hall finde trafficke enough for <HI>Pauwels van Sold,</HI> beeing in the Shippe called <HI>Delfte,</HI> hath (as I vnder&s;tood of the <HI>Portugales</HI> that were taken before <HI>Queda</HI>) gotten three hundred bales of Cotten, linnen pain|ted, and al&s;o &s;ome Pintados.</P>
<P>I intended to goe the inner waye to <HI>Bantam</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="13">with &s;ixe Ships, to &s;ee if I can make agreement al|&s;o with the King, and from thence to take our voy|age towards <HI>Amboyna</HI> and the <HI>Molucques,</HI> for <HI>Am|boyna</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bee fortified, and wee mu&s;t trie once againe to get the <HI>Molucques.</HI> Tho&s;e of <HI>Banda</HI> play the bea&s;ts: &s;ome re&s;olution or other mu&s;t bee taken, for our men with their goods, that are there not a&s;&s;ured of their liues, and the goods of the company are much endangered. From thence we will make towards <HI>China,</HI> and trye what we can doe there.</P>
<P>In the boate which I tooke before <HI>Malacca</HI> vp|on the three and twentith of October, I had &s;euen and thirtie bales, mo&s;t part linnen cloath, and &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lether, whereof &s;eauen I &s;ent by the &s;ame boate to <HI>Amboyna,</HI> with foure thou&s;and ry|als, foure and forty men, and forty <HI>Negros,</HI> and the halfe part of his lading of Rice, that was &s;poyled: and to goe to <HI>Maraza</HI> to buy good Ri&s;e, Fle&s;h, and &s;ome Pintados or Cotton, Painted cloath, for to carry to <HI>Amboina,</HI> and to tell them that I would follow after them in the end of December: The other &s;euenteene Bales I gaue to our Saylers for a prize, with a Bale of thred, to make them the more willinger and readier to fight, for that they had gotten but little bootie. I hope we &s;hall finde lading at <HI>Amboina</HI> and <HI>Banda,</HI> for the Pintados or Cotton cloath of <HI>Panwels van Sold,</HI> &s;hall no doubt haue prepared &s;ome-thing for vs.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="14">
<P>I perceiue full well that wee &s;hall haue long worke to doe about the <HI>Molucques,</HI> and that the time will fall out too &s;hort for vs to goe to <HI>Mou|&s;on</HI> in <HI>China;</HI> but time will teach vs what is to bee done: if wee a&s;&s;ure not <HI>Amboina,</HI> all our labour is in vaine, it is al&s;o again&s;t my opinion that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;hould come thether.</P>
<P>The Generall <HI>Don Pedro de Sou&s;a</HI> is made Mar|quis of <HI>Ternate:</HI> The King that is taken is carryed to the We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> but his &s;onne is leaft with the King of <HI>Sidor,</HI> I was in good hope to haue perfor|med &s;ome-thing, but my armie is too much weake|ned, and I finde what hurt I receiued from the &s;hip that was burning before <HI>Malacca,</HI> for there I lo&s;t the be&s;t men in my &s;hippes: it is a &s;trange thing that they are &s;o ra&s;hlye and rudely giuen to the &s;poile, yet notwith&s;tanding I mu&s;t bee content and holde my peace.</P>
