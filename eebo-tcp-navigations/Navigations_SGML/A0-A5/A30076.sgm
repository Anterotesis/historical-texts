<P>THis &s;mall Worke is undertaken for the gene|rall good, as well of the Inhabitants, as the Adventurers, and therefore requires a familiar pen, and plain matter, more then height of &s;tyle: the Author had rather do good, then be commended; there|fore refu&s;ed to let the Work be u&s;hered in by the com|mendation of others: he is not ignorant, what a &s;light e&s;teem this place hath among&s;t the generality of the people, and knowes a good name is &s;ooner lo&s;t then recovered, and that when men joyn with common fame to de&s;troy a good Work, the Devill hath got a victory;
<PB REF="4">
wherein 'tis extreamly con&s;iderable, how great an ene|my he hath alwayes been to the Planting of the Go&s;|pell, e&s;pecially, in places where (as here) the Natives own him for their God: Therefore let no man won|der, the good of this place hath been &s;o much ob&s;tru|cted, &s;ince now they know by whom. I have in this place lo&s;t &s;ome thou&s;ands of pounds, yet cannot har|bour an ill opinion, &s;ince I am fully &s;atisfied, the fault was onely in the men I tru&s;ted, and this hath been every lo&s;ers condition: wherefore let the Countrey &s;uffer no longer under our hard cen&s;ures; Good Laws duly executed, will make good men, and quickly change the a&s;pect of the&s;e places, there wanting nothing el&s;e under God to make them flouri&s;h. Ambition, among&s;t other things, hath been none of the lea&s;t hinderance: Therefore he doth advi&s;e all &s;uch as intend to be la|bourers in this Harve&s;t, to &s;tudy meekne&s;&s;e, and the generall good: for if it be well con&s;idered, 'tis much better to be equall to, then a Ju&s;tice of Peace, in which &s;en&s;e he &s;peakes him&s;elf; and if thou bee&s;t &s;uch, then he's thine,</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="explanation of purpose">
<HEAD>The principall Motive, that drew the Author to this Worke, was,</HEAD>
<P>THat finding many Gentlemen have un&s;etled them|&s;elves, with a de&s;ire to better their fortunes in re|mote places, and in this condition, inqui&s;itive after the &s;everall Plantations abroad, to the end they might make choice of the be&s;t, in which they are much troubled with the various relations both by books and men, who&s;e onely aime is to draw all men to them&s;elves; and to further that Work, are liberall to abu&s;e all other places but their own: by which means men are di&s;per&s;t abroad in &s;everall &s;mall numbers, at great di&s;tances from each other, which is very
<PB REF="5">
uncomfortable and di&s;ccu&s;olate, whereas if they had been all directed to any one good place, they might have been in this time a great and flouri&s;hing people: and finding al|&s;o (without di&s;paraging of other places) that this Coun|trey of <HI>Virginia</HI> is abundantly &s;tored with what is by all men aimed at, <HI>viz.</HI> Health and Wealth, &s;o that there wants nothing to their happine&s;&s;e that go over, but good In&s;tructions, which were never yet endeavoured, more then to &s;hew the place; I thought that man that &s;hould kindly take the &s;tranger by the hand, and lead him to it, &s;hewing him not onely the richest Mines, but al&s;o how to dig them, would de&s;erve much thanks.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="warning to the reader">
<HEAD>I cannot omit, by way of Caution to my deere Countrey-men, to admoni&s;h them,</HEAD>
<P>That at this time there is much &s;trugling to draw men to new Plantations, never yet &s;eated; and if they will peru&s;e the books that have been &s;et forth in the Infancy of the most of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations abroad, they shall &s;ee with what lo&s;&s;e and dangers they have beene &s;etled; <HI>viz.</HI> by having their &s;hips cast away, for want of know|ledge of the place; by want of food, till &s;upplies; by &s;trange di&s;ea&s;es, never before heard of; by Divi&s;ions and Facti|ons among&s;t them&s;elves, and an innumerable of other Inci|dents happening to them, wherely the places have beene &s;everall times de&s;erted, and again Planted, before ever we could keep our footing.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I &s;hall advi&s;e all men to make u&s;e of other mens wofull experience, and to di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to &s;uch places as are already Planted, where all difficulties are now overcome.</P>

<P>The Government is the greate&s;t of all; for no wi&s;e man will either tran&s;port him&s;elfe, or &s;end his e&s;tate to &s;uch a place where is no &s;etled Government, and whol|&s;ome Lawes to pre&s;erve mens lives and e&s;tates, and to maintaine hone&s;t commerce.</P>
<P>The Government is, by Governour, Councell, and A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The Governour is commonly a Stranger, &s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> and is to la&s;t but three yeares, in which time, he mu&s;t not be blamed, if he doe his owne Worke.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other things, he can call Tru&s;tees and Deb|tors to be of the Councell, which puts the Adventurer to a &s;tand.</P>
<P>And this well con&s;idered, hath gone a great way in the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>For, by it Ju&s;tice is &s;tifled, and the Adventurer mu&s;t never hope for Ju&s;tice, &s;ince the Debtor is by the Go|vernours favour, made both Judge and Party; by which meanes 'tis cleare, the greater the Aduenture the &s;urer lo&s;t, for the Tru&s;tee &s;hall be the &s;ooner a Councellor.</P>
<P>In the&s;e things I &s;peake experimentally of &s;uch as were before, but doe not charge the pre&s;ent Gover|nours, for by their care the Plantation is in &s;ome rea|&s;onable condition of recovery.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Next, by the People.</HEAD>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly in manner as it hath beene cho&s;en, hath been mi&s;chievous, for they have not beene elected for their hone&s;ties and abilities, but by their great Port, although maintained with an Adventurers pur&s;e; and &s;uch was the A&s;&s;embly, when mo&s;t of them being bound to pay Mony-Debts, made an Act of A&s;&s;embly, that they &s;hould pay their Debts in <HI>Tobacco</HI> at 12. d. <HI>per</HI> li. when
<PB N="11" REF="12">
it was &s;old at the &s;ame time in the Countrey for one penny.</P>
<P>The Laws were bad, and wor&s;e admini&s;tred, by which meanes indu&s;trie was di&s;couraged, and &s;trifes counte|nanced.</P>
<P>The Councells time, that &s;hould be better &s;pent for the encouraging of others, taken up in hearing, but not determining unnece&s;&s;ary &s;trifes.</P>
<P>Next, the Di&s;ea&s;e growes by the Commoditie they have and doe make their Staple; which,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, from the very infancy of the Plantation, they have made <HI>Tobacco</HI> their Staple, which hath been &s;ent for <HI>England</HI> in &s;uch quantities, as many yeares there hath beene &s;ome hundred thou&s;and pounds weight, not worth the fraught and cu&s;tome, and by this means many a poore Planter hath been de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Tobacco</HI> being once in the ground, is never out of hand till in the Hogs-head; and, which is the mi&s;ery of it, the Moneths of <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> being the very height of the Summer, the poore Ser|vant goes daily through the rowes of <HI>Tobacco</HI> &s;tooping to worme it, and being over-heated he is &s;truck with a Calenture or Feaver, and &s;o peri&s;heth: This hath been the lo&s;&s;e of divers men.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the <HI>Tobacco</HI> is ripe but once in the year, and Ships goe for <HI>Virginia</HI> at that time when they may have the <HI>Tobacco</HI> for their home-ward fraught, there being nothing el&s;e to lade them, which makes many here in <HI>England</HI> thinke, that it is a yeares Voyage to <HI>Virginia,</HI> whereas if there were other Commodities to lade Shipping, they might go and return in four or five Moneths at the mo&s;t, by which meanes many a man that would willingly have gone away in <HI>March,</HI> had there beene Shipping to tran&s;port him, is of another minde, or hath otherwi&s;e &s;ettled him&s;elfe before <HI>Sep|tember</HI> comes, which is the u&s;uall time of going.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
Fourthly, that by &s;hips going in this manner, they are pe&s;tered with people, who thereby are very much indangered in their healths, and the pa&s;&s;enger is at as much more charge in his tran&s;portation as otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be, for he payes 5 l. 10 s. for a mans pa&s;|&s;age, and keeping his men at charge in the Cookes Shops in Saint <HI>Katherines</HI> five or &s;ix weekes, &s;tands him neare in 3 li. a man more, whereas, if &s;hips were con|&s;tantly going, it would not &s;tand him in above 4 li. 10 s. a man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> Treachery, like a malignant di&s;ea&s;e, hath hindred many friends from vi&s;iting it, for the ma&s;&s;acre in 1622, wherein was &s;lain 350, hath &s;cared many peo|ple from coming to it, which if truly under&s;tood would not fright the meane&s;t &s;pirit, &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by repo|&s;ing tru&s;t and confidence in the <HI>Indian,</HI> gave the op|portunity, for it was not the &s;trength of millions could injure them. And who&s;oever &s;hall reade the re|lation of the ma&s;&s;acre, &s;et out 1622, will find there is no danger in them, except you give them weapons, and &s;tand &s;till whil&s;t they de&s;troy you.</P>
<P>And next, the mi&s;carriage of good de&s;ignes for Staple commodities hath added much, wherein I could in&s;tance in particular, by whom the de&s;ignes of making <HI>Pot-a&s;hes, Rape,</HI> and <HI>Walnut Orle,</HI> and other Staples, as al&s;o &s;etting up Saw-Mills, were &s;et on foot, and the particular rea&s;ons how they came to fail; which was not for want of the Countries being plentifully &s;tored with materialls, but by other ca&s;ualties: the particu|culars would take up too much room in this place; My de&s;ire being to make this &s;o &s;hort as the very e&s;&s;ence of the matter will beare, that it may not tire but de|light and fully &s;atisfie the Reader: wherefore I will give you &s;ome few generalls, whereby &s;uch may be admi|ni&s;hed, as &s;hall come after, how to avoid the mi&s;|chiefes they fell under.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="13">
1.

<P>Malitious tongues hath impaired it much: For it hath beene a con&s;tant report among&s;t the ordinarie &s;ort of people, That all tho&s;e &s;ervants who are &s;ent to <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> are &s;old as &s;laves: whereas the truth is, that the Merchants who &s;end &s;ervants, and have no Plantations of their owne, doe onely transferre their Time over to

<P>HAving thus con&s;idered the Di&s;ea&s;e, and how contracted, I &s;hall pre&s;cribe a plaine and ea&s;ie way for the Recoverie, which &s;hall be, fir&s;t, by a whol&s;ome and equall Government, that may incourage, delight, and &s;ecure all men.</P>
<P>Before you enter into the Government, ob&s;erve the Propo&s;er, whom you &s;hall finde more imployed about the Foundation then the Building, &s;ince 'tis found, that the fir&s;t failing, the &s;econd cannot &s;tand: And that he may not appeare altogether ignorant of what he under|takes, 'tis fit you &s;hould under&s;tand, that among&s;t other things he lookt into the Fabrick of <HI>Englands</HI> Lawes, and
<PB N="15" REF="14">
finding Rea&s;on the Key, he endeavoured to enter, where at the very fir&s;t, his Rea&s;on quarrelled with that part of the Building. wherein the di&s;&s;ent of fee-&s;imple e&s;tates was lodged, &s;ince the doore onely opened to let in the brothers of the whole bloud, but was &s;hut again&s;t the bro|thers of the half, although they were the children of one father; and that rather then let them in, though &s;o neere, the e&s;tate mu&s;t look an heire of the whole bloud, though he can but call Cou&s;in at never &s;o great a di&s;tance, who as it were &s;hall &s;natch the e&s;tate away, as if the half bro|thers were all Ba&s;tards. And prying further into this part, he found many mi&s;chiefes depending on it; to in&s;tance one for all: A man in povertie marries as poorely, and hath a &s;onne; the Wife dyes, he after marries richly, and hath many children, purcha&s;eth a fee-&s;imple e&s;tate, then dyes: the &s;onne by the fir&s;t venture, enters and dyes; his Cou&s;in, it matters not in what degrees di&s;tant, &s;hall wipe the re&s;t of the children of the e&s;tate which was brought by their owne mother. My rea&s;on told me, that the fa|thers owne children &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively let in before the Cou&s;in of the whole bloud: but being &s;atisfied in knowing the har&s;h rea&s;on of this Law, which was onely to pre&s;erve the e&s;tate in the whole bloud in a right line; he ventured further, de&s;iring to under&s;tand the unifor|mitie, but met &s;uch contrarieties of Judgements &amp; Opi|nions, both in Law and Equitie, upon the &s;elfe-&s;ame Ca|&s;es, occa&s;ioned by the &s;trength of Rea&s;on, more prevay|ling with one Judge then another, &amp; Rules in Pleading, accompanied with various Circum&s;tances and Niceties, full of Intricacies, and multitudes of Officers and Offi|ces, (to know which &s;everally, requires an Age) had &s;well'd the&s;e Buildings to that va&s;tne&s;&s;e, that he plainely &s;aw, it was not one mans whole lives &s;tudie could make him Ma&s;ter thereof; all which proceeded from the mix|ture of the Laws of other Nations, who in &s;everall times had power over this Kingdom: all which con&s;ider'd, made

him retire, and to content him&s;elf in &s;eeking upon what foundation this &s;trange and Labyrinth-like building was erected, which he di&s;covered to be politick rea&s;on, and then he thought whether (&s;ince the ground-work in the general was &s;o good, &amp; tho&s;e who had the Government &s;o minded) tho&s;e parts of the foundation, that are &s;o har&s;h and rugged, might not be altered and made more &s;mooth and equall, and the building made to an&s;wer: but he found it could not be, without apparant danger to the whole, &s;ince &s;o many with &s;everall titles had built their e&s;tates upon it.</P>
<P>Next, he apprehended to take the whole building down, and the foundation from the be&s;t of the materi|alls new laid, and then, whether men might not in the mean time, and untill the fabrick &s;hould be again erected, lodge their e&s;tates in &s;ome &s;afe hand, to be de|livered them back, after the &s;tructure fini&s;ht, by &s;ome generall and free title: he was pre&s;ently an&s;wered; That happily many in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion would willingly con&s;ent, but tho&s;e intere&s;&s;ed in e&s;tates Tayl, the heires of the whole bloud, and of the half, the heires according to &s;e|verall Cu&s;tomes, the Lords of Manours, and their Cu&s;tomary Tenants, and many more of like nature, would never agree about the redelivery of them back. By which he perceived it was impo&s;&s;ible to alter any of <HI>Englands</HI> Lawes, with Ju&s;tice to all intere&s;ts, onely &s;ome thing might be done to prevent the mi&s;chiefe that lay upon the Subject in the cour&s;e and proceed|ings of the Lawes, and this no better way, then having in all times faithfull and able Lawyers, and that there might be &s;ome better way found out to make &s;uch as in|tend to profe&s;&s;e the Law, to &s;pend more time in their &s;tudies, before they undertake to advi&s;e men how to lo&s;e their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>All which being weighed, he was re&s;olved, that no &s;tructure could be &s;o commodious and delightfull, as
<PB N="17" REF="15">
when it is carried up intire, with con&s;ideration, that in ca&s;e the Family increa&s;e, there might be additions without defacing.</P>
<P>Wherfore having by the means afore&s;aid a little know|ledge of the foundation of <HI>Englands</HI> Laws, &amp; having by experience found many mi&s;chiefs and inconveniencies to grow from &s;everall parts thereof, he con&s;idered, whether he might not venture from thence to de&s;ign a plea&s;ant and intire building, wherewith all men (not otherwi&s;e clog'd and fettered with e&s;tates, held by Ancient and in|tricate titles &amp; Cu&s;tomes) might be taken, and chearfully contribute to the work: &amp; upon enquiry after a place to &s;et his Frame upon, he found the forraigne Plantations were already hard at work about it; but having &s;urveyed their Draught, he clearly &s;aw they had left too many doors for inconveniences, &amp; which was wor&s;e, the foun|dation was mi&s;taken, and &s;o the higher they built, the more dangerous. All which was ea&s;y to be rectified, &s;ince in re&s;pect they were as yet but pin'd together with their intere&s;t under a common title, and &s;lightly fa&s;tned with per&s;onall ties: being glad of this advantage, that po&s;&s;i|bly he might be the Author of &s;o good a work, he chear|fully undertooke the Modelling the &s;ame. And find|ing that Government is no other then the extraction of power into the hand of one or more, to the end it may be di&s;penced upon all occa&s;ions for the peoples good &amp; &s;afety, he con&s;idered, that tho&s;e in whom the power re&s;t|ed, ought to be for wi&s;dome, ju&s;tice, and integrity, drawn from the very quinte&s;&s;ence of the people, which mu&s;t be done by a through knowledge of each other, whereby they would be able from among&s;t them&s;elves, to &s;et the be&s;t, the fir&s;t &s;tep towards the Government, and they pre&s;ently to have power over tho&s;e that cho&s;e them, but not to be in the Chu&s;ers power to call back; the highe&s;t power, after, &s;hall by &s;teps rai&s;e them accor|ding to their abilities, which you'l find more plain in the following Government.</P>

<HEAD>Another good meanes to the Recovery mu&s;t be by rai&s;ing Commodities for the con&s;tant imploy|ment of Shipping; and although this &s;peak it &s;elf, yet examples will doe well.</HEAD>
<P>And fir&s;t let us look upon New <HI>England,</HI> a Plantati|on begun thirteen yeares &s;ince <HI>Virginia,</HI> viz. in the yeare 1620, the ground no more comparable to <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> then the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is to the South of <HI>England,</HI> they have no Sugar, Indigo, Ginger, or any other of the rich Commodities before &s;poken of, nei|ther will they grow there; yet in this little time of 28 years they are become a flouri&s;hing people, and with many gallant Ships built, and every way fitted with ma|terialls rai&s;ed out of their own Countrey; and al&s;o ladden with their own Native Commodities, drive a Trade with all the world, in&s;omuch as men &s;hall &s;el|dome mi&s;&s;e pa&s;&s;age for New <HI>England</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> once in two Moneths; and by this means, have many fine Towns, and are full of people.</P>
<P>Next look upon that little I&s;land of <HI>Barbado's</HI> not much bigger then the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> which lay langui&s;h|ing of the di&s;ea&s;e <HI>Virginia</HI> now grones under, (till with|in this five or &s;ix years pa&s;t,) you may &s;ee how by the &s;trength of an indifferent Staple Commodity, <HI>viz</HI> Sugar, Indigo, Cotton Wool, &amp; Ginger, it is &s;trangely recover|ed, that there's whole Fleets of Ships con&s;tantly going &amp; coming between it and <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that Pa&s;&s;engers are going, thither con&s;tantly, and they are grown to that height of Trade, that it hath been affirmed to me from very good hands inhabiting in that place, that the la&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="23">
yeare there was from all places imployed thither above onehundred Sail of Ships, and they are &s;eldome without twenty, or thirty Sail in their harbour.</P>
<P>Yet I can well remember the time, when their fame was much wor&s;e, then <HI>Virginia's</HI> now is.</P>
<P>By this means, they have great numbers of men tran&s;|port them&s;elves of all degrees.</P>
<P>And all this is for&s;t, by the commodity; for their Government is not &s;o good that any wi&s;e man &s;hould be in love with, nor is this I&s;land &s;o extraordinary plea|&s;ant to intice men above other places, al&s;o the Adven|turers have had as indifferent mea&s;ure there.</P>
<P>And this well and wi&s;ely con&s;idered, how much more &s;hall that place flouri&s;h, whereby a &s;weet and harmonious Government all men &s;hall have faire and hone&s;t dealing, in a land full of plea&s;ure and delight, yielding abundance of the be&s;t Staple commodities in the whole world.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The next help to the Recovery, must be by the commodity, we are to fix upon, wherefore, we will examine all, and make choice of the be&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>There is without que&s;tion in this Country, &s;tore of Gold, and Silver Mynes, which I could clearly demon|&s;trate, but the di&s;covery will bring ruine to the place, for all Princes, and Potentates clayme an intere&s;t in Gold and Silver, which they will reach with their &s;words. I &s;hall &s;ay no more of them.</P>
<P>The next is Sugar, Indigo, Cotton Wool, and Ginger, the very Commodities of the &s;aid I&s;land; all which will grow on the Southermo&s;t part of <HI>Virginia,</HI> but yet they will not do the work, for fir&s;t the Sugar Canes
<PB N="32" REF="24">
and <HI>Indigo</HI> &s;eeds to plant, mu&s;t be brought from the <HI>Barbado's</HI> or &s;ome other place, and then they are two or three yeares before perfect; and experienced men will al&s;o be wanting, and will be a work in re&s;pect of the charge, that but a few can compa&s;&s;e: and which is wor&s;t of all, the &s;aid I&s;lands having gotten the &s;tart, will make tho&s;e commodities drugges, before our Harve&s;t; for in this little time, <HI>Indigo</HI> is fallen from nine &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> pound, to three &s;hillings &s;ix pence, and I have heard &s;ome of the Gentlemen them|&s;elves &s;ay, that <HI>Indigo</HI> in a very little time will not quit co&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are fine commodities for wi&s;e men to be do|ing with, indifferent quantities, but not to be the Staples that mu&s;t do the work.</P>
<P>The next in con&s;ideration, will be Wine, Rei&s;ons, Dyes, and Drugges; truly great quantities of the&s;e, will make them Drugges indeed: be&s;ides, the time and money &s;pent before they can be brought to per|fection, may happily make the poore Planter, with the hor&s;e &s;tarve, whil&s;t the gra&s;&s;e grows.</P>
<P>Yet I confe&s;&s;e all the&s;e are very good to be brought on by degrees, without prejudice to the main De|&s;igne.</P>
<P>The next that offer them&s;elves, are Mynes of Copper, Tinne, Iron, and Lead, of all which, there is plenty in <HI>Virginia.</HI> The&s;e are clearly of the be&s;t &s;ort of Staples, but they require a great deale of charge and time to bring them to perfection, and there is much of ca&s;ualty happens in the working rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Therefore, if we run greedily upon them, they may chance to be too heavy for us, either in lifting, or carrying.</P>
<P>Wherefore my advice is, that the&s;e things may be &s;toln upon, at mo&s;t lea&s;ure time, and when we have
<PB N="33" REF="24">
built a &s;ure foundation upon Staple Commodities of a quicker production.</P>
<P>And now will I think of Silk, Pot-a&s;hes, Rape, and Walnut oyle: and the&s;e are very good Staples. But yet when I con&s;ider, we are not all Pot-a&s;hes, nor Oyle|makers, nor Ma&s;ters of the Silk-worme my&s;tery, nor can pre&s;ently be at the charge, the&s;e are not &s;uch as mu&s;t be built upon for the pre&s;ent Staples.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, but a &s;ingle, double, or treble pur&s;e, &s;o as they be &s;trong, may ea&s;ily with great advantage effect any of the afore&s;aid Staples; and by degrees, the re&s;t may follow.</P>
<P>Then we find in the Countrey Ma&s;ts for Ships, Pitch, Tarre, Ro&s;&s;ine, Turpentine, Clapboard, and Pipe&s;taves: The&s;e are good Staples, but gro&s;&s;e Commodities, and mo&s;t of them fitter to be made u&s;e of in the Countrey for building &s;hips, and will do well when there are no other Fraughts.</P>
<P>The&s;e in their proportions are &s;ure Commodities, and will helpe exceedingly, after better Staples are &s;et upon.</P>
<P>I will now pre&s;ent you with <HI>Englands</HI> Staples, among&s;t which I find Corn, Hemp, Flax, Rape-&s;eed, Cattle, Wool, to which I will adde one more, that cannot be had in <HI>England,</HI> and that is Rice, I am &s;ure we can all be ma|&s;ters of the Plough, and &s;hall &s;oon be Ma&s;ters of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And here I fix for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for that we may all fall to the&s;e workes &s;o &s;oone as we are landed, and the &s;ea&s;on come.</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e Flax, Rice, and Rape-&s;eed will grow all the Countrey over, and Wheat in all places, where the ground hath beene broken up before, of which there is plenty upon every Plantation which is pa&s;t bearing of Tobacco, yet the be&s;t for Wheate; and there be divers other places, where VVheat will pro&s;per
<PB N="34" REF="25">
exceedingly, that are not over-rich; for in many places, where the ground was never broke up, 'tis too rich for our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Corn, &s;ending up the Stalk &s;o high, that the wind layes it: and Cattle are there already in abun|dance.</P>
<P>The principalle&s;t rea&s;on is, that many Ships may be yearely laden by a few hands imployed in Corn, Rice, Rape-&s;eed, and Flax, and if you ob&s;erve but the following Scale, you &s;hall find three hands to make yearly above twenty two tunnes of Corne, and Flax: and &s;o proportionably a thou&s;and hands imployed in Wheat, Rice, Flax, and Rape-&s;eed, will yearely lade fifty Sail of Ships, of one hundred and fifty Tunne a Ship; by which it is evident that an infinite Trade by Sea might be &s;uddenly driven, there being alrea|dy in this place above 15000 men, be&s;ides women, and children, and &s;uch numbers of Ships con&s;tant|ly comming and going, would quickely people the Countrey: and it is not from the purpo&s;e to &s;hew the failings of the fir&s;t Adventurers for want of this foundation, for if you peru&s;e their books Printed 1622, you &s;hall find after they have told you, what the beauties are of the place, that their Commodi|ties they intended, were Cordage, Pot-a&s;hes, Iron, and the like; in all which many hands can make but &s;low worke, as to the lading of Ships, for the advantage of this place is, to rai&s;e the be&s;t of rough Commodities to be tran&s;ported. Where hands are plenty, labour is cheap.</P>
<P>And for the greater incouragement, there is in this Countrey all materialls for the building and com|pleat fini&s;hing Ships, to carry the&s;e Commodities to their Markets: Before I go further, let me recollect my &s;elfe, and thinke what a ble&s;&s;ed Countrey mu&s;t this be, where Gods ble&s;&s;ings &s;everally di&s;tributed upon other Countries meet all in one.</P>

Let not our young Planter fear that he &s;hall want a|ny thing for being new come over, and uningaged in the Countrey, his credit for any thing he &s;hall want, will be as good as the be&s;t mans in the Coun|trey, but let him not be bold with it, le&s;t he forget his errand, and loiter out his time in good fellow&s;hip, then which, there can be nothing more dangerous, &s;ince he is but now entring into his preferment: This Caveat is good, for it hath lo&s;t many a man.</P>
<P>And now having fitted him to his work, I will advi&s;e him in it.</P>
<P>He &s;hall plough but twenty three Acres, twenty whereof he &s;hall &s;owe with Wheat, and three with Flax, for which work I will allow him eight weekes with two hands, which may with much ea&s;e be done, the ground being light: but if the <HI>Dutch</HI> plough|ing comes in u&s;e, as I doubt not but this yeare it will, then one man doth the work of ploughing, and the two &s;pare hands &s;hall fall upon the inclo&s;ing the ground that is a ploughing, and after the &s;eed is in the ground, the third hand falls in, there being nothing el&s;e to do till Harve&s;t; long before which, I doubt not, but the enclo&s;ing 23 Acres will be done, when they may fall to building their new hou&s;e, or preparing of ground again&s;t the next year by inclo&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Harve&s;t being come, the Flax is fir&s;t to be reap|ed, which I &s;hould have told you before, mu&s;t not be &s;owne till <HI>May,</HI> for which worke and the beating out the &s;eed, I allow three weeks; then comes the twenty Acres of Corne to be reaped, for which I allow three weeks; there needs no trouble of carting till it be thre&s;h|ed, for it &s;halbe thre&s;hed or trodden out with Oxen in the Field; I &s;hall allow &s;ix dayes in worke for watering of the Flax; for the thre&s;hing of the Corne I allow ten weekes, but if it be trod or rubbed out as in the I&s;lands with Oxen, a fortnight and le&s;&s;e will doe it; I allow

twenty five weekes for dre&s;&s;ing nine hundred &s;tone of Flax, in which a man &s;hall dre&s;&s;e but two &s;tone a day, in this worke the year is compleatly &s;pent; in <HI>England</HI> I know it would be done in two thirds of the time, but I had rather value it as I doe, that every man may be &s;a|tisfied of the truth of the propo&s;ition.</P>

<P>And I am confident a wor&s;e Market cannot be had, I hope having propo&s;ed every thing we buy at the high|e&s;t rate, and every thing we &s;ell at the lowe&s;t rate, and in the wor&s;t Market; you will be &s;atisfied of the reality of the propo&s;ition, and that it is a &s;ure Foundation for a greater building.</P>
<P>I &s;ee you have &s;omething el&s;e, pray what is it? you would know what the poore Planter &s;hall doe to &s;upply him till the returne of his Adventure, and then what &s;hall become of him if his Adventure mi&s;carrie?</P>
<P>Truly you have give me that advantage by your ob|jecting of dangers, that I &s;hall in&s;ure the Adventure and the new Planter at the end of the two fir&s;t yeares, &s;hall in&s;ure him &s;elfe to be in a better condition then the Gentleman that in <HI>England</HI> hath 200. li. <HI>per annum,</HI> and &s;hall every yeare double his e&s;tate at the lea&s;t, and this with much ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Wherefore I mu&s;t tell you that our Planters credit is &s;trong, either in the Countrey with the Planters, or with the Merchants, for &s;o much if not more then his commoditie is worth; his old &s;tock is &s;till the &s;ame, and therefore wants nothing, but to pay for his and his mans diet and their wages for the fore-going yeare, which is 30. l. yet I will allow him to &s;pend the over|plus above 100. li. which in the Country was 72. li. or in <HI>England</HI> will be more, &amp; this 100. l. in goods he &s;hal &s;end by the la&s;t Shipping that comes for <HI>England,</HI> he needs not fear to have his Market fore&s;tall'd &s;ince his commoditie is &s;o Staple, and his advantage will be, that hee may

&s;end his letters of advice to his friends by the fir&s;t Ships, that they may in <HI>England</HI> before hand know, what Ships the Adventure comes in, and cau&s;e the 100. l. Adventure to be in&s;ured, which hath been u&s;ually done for 50. s. and the Adventure being arrived in <HI>England,</HI> I propo&s;e it to be laid out for the Planters good in manner following.</P>
<P>50. li. for the pa&s;&s;age and cloathing of &s;ix men, which it will plentifully doe, &s;ince they will need nothing but cloathes and to pay their pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>06. li. In two Guns, powder and &s;hot, Plough, Irons, and Iron-tooles, as he &s;hall appoint.</P>
<P>30. li to be inve&s;ted in Commodities as he &s;hall di|rect to buy more Cattle in the Countrey.</P>
<P>02. li. 10. s. paid for the Premio of the fir&s;t en&s;u|rance.</P>

<P>02. li. 10. s. to en&s;ure the Adventure to <HI>Virginia.</HI> 100&mdash;00</P>
<P>And now is our Planter &s;ecure of his e&s;tate, and when the Adventure comes over, he is nine men &s;trong, and by their rea&s;onable endeavours may again&s;t the next return, in the follwing year by the rule afore&s;aid, have an e&s;tate of above 600. li. 00. s. be&s;ides his &s;tock, which &s;hews him he is in a happy condition.</P>
<P>And to encourage the new Flanter, let him con&s;ider with him&s;elfe that it is but two or three yeares care, to bring him to this &s;afe harbour, and what paines and la|bour is taken by the poore Farmer in <HI>England,</HI> getting his bread with the &s;weat of his browes, and after eating it with care and &s;orrow, &amp; all this but to pay his Land-Lord's Rent, and to procure &s;ome &s;mall &s;ub&s;&s;i&s;tance; whereas here is no Rent to pay, and yet the Land twice as good as the be&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> food plenty, co&s;t nothing but taking, which is done with much ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="29">
Rice, and Rape-&s;eed are farre richer Commodities, and done all with the &s;ame or le&s;&s;er care and labour, the&s;e grow be&s;t upon the riche&s;t ground, and therefore mo&s;t fit for the Countrey, the increa&s;e and profit much greater then tho&s;e I have taken to illu&s;trate the Propo|&s;ition by, for my de&s;ire was, to examine the meane&s;t of the &s;aid Staples; and let the be&s;t alone to help them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>If all this will not make <HI>Thomas</HI> a Believer, let him then enquire of the principalle&s;t &s;traights and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants, walking the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and they &s;hall tell him, that when they can be &s;atisfied that there is ei|ther Corne, Rice, Hemp, or Flax to be had, there &s;hall be no want of &s;hips, and ready money paid for it, at the rate that I propo&s;e, they will tell him a hundred pound hath been u&s;ually a&s;&s;ured from <HI>Virginia</HI> for 50s.</P>
<P>Thus having brought the Planter to happine&s;&s;e in this life, I &s;hall with &s;ome few admonitions &s;hake hands and leave him to the God of mercies prote|ction.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that God be by him and his Family truly &s;er|ved, and before and after work his ble&s;&s;ing be duly implored.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall advi&s;e him that he let not his mind ri&s;e with his riches, for that is the ready way to forget that God that gave them, and to make them like the &s;weete&s;t &s;innes that delight the body, but poy&s;on the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That he halt not between this and a|ny other de&s;igne, let it appeare never &s;o beautifull, but fall clo&s;e to this, till he hath put him&s;elfe pa&s;t danger.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that he make no u&s;e of his Credit, but for ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>For other advi&s;e, he &s;hall find them under the title of advi&s;e in the end of the book.</P>

And now let me turn back, and look upon my poore Spirited Countreymen in <HI>England,</HI> and examine fir&s;t the meane&s;t, that is, the poore ploughman, day-labourer, and poore Artificer, and I &s;hall find them labouring, and &s;weating all dayes of their lives; &s;ome for fourteen pence, others for &s;ixteen, eighten, twenty pence, or two Shillings a day; which is the highe&s;t of wages to &s;uch kind of people, and the mo&s;t of them to end their dayes in &s;orrow, not having purcha&s;ed &s;o much by their lives labour, as will &s;caace pre&s;erve them in their old dayes from beggery: where by adventuring them&s;elves, in a foure, or five weekes voyage (at mo&s;t) over the Seas; which is nothing; they may with le&s;&s;e labour, and care, in foure or five yeares &s;ee them&s;elves in a condition never again to want; but to live like Gentlemen, and that by their owne Trades they have been bred in, for where a great Merchant-like Trade is driven, as will be &s;uddenly in this place; all Artifi|cers and handicraft labour is dear, which will appeare more plain, if we here in <HI>England,</HI> con&s;ider the diffe|rence, betweene the North parts, where you may have a labourer for foure, five, or &s;ix pence the day, and <HI>London</HI> where we pay twelve, fourteen, or &s;ixteen pence the day, the rea&s;on is becau&s;e of the great Trade that's driven at <HI>London</HI> by Merchants, and the little or Trade in the North.</P>
<P>Next I &s;hall look upon the poore Yeo|man, <NOTE PLACE="marg">For if 60. li. afore&s;aid &s;hall produce above 170 l. <HI>per annum.</HI> 200 li. which is the E&s;tate I here value, may produce much more then 300 l. <HI>per annum,</HI> and the Ma&s;ter live plenti|fully.</NOTE> with ten, fifteen, or twenty pound <HI>per annum</HI> land, or the value thereof in his pur&s;e; which with continuall care helps him to eat bread; yet this E&s;tate weigh|ed by the afore&s;aid Scale, will truly tell him, that being tran&s;ported to this place he is a Gentleman of three hundred pound a yeare at lea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="30">
Then come I &s;adly to look upon the poore Gen|tleman of fiftie, &s;ixtie, or a hundred pound <HI>per an|num,</HI> who was happily the younge&s;t Sonne of &s;ome Gentleman, of a great E&s;tate, which was &s;ettled upon the elde&s;t &s;on and this to keep up the Familie, one|ly that the younger Children might be quiet, there is &s;ome &s;uperfluities thereof, thrown among&s;t them, which together with their Gentility, and the expe|ctation of an elder Brothers death, holds them up; till Children and Charge &s;ucks them under mi&s;erie: Let the&s;e men timely bring their e&s;tates to this ballance, and they &s;hall make them&s;elves Elder Brothers.</P>
<P>The Merchant is ready for receiving the Com|modity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adventurer is in the &s;en&s;e of the book him that &s;ends to plant The Govern|ment wil pre|&s;erve this e|&s;tate with the increa&s;e.</NOTE> and to performe his part; but that is to be done without the Scale: yet I mu&s;t joyne him with the Adventurer; for which I know in time he will give me thankes: and my Advice &s;hall be to him, and the Adventurer to bring foure or five hundred pound to the Scale, and they will finde it profitable without danger: for the Govern|ment will make the Scale go true.</P>
<P>The man of money too, if his heart will &s;erve him, may weigh two or three hundred pound at this Scale, and he will finde it in two yeares, more then ballance the yearly u&s;e of foure or five thou&s;and pound, and the Government for his &s;ecu|rity, will a&s;&s;ure him, that his money is placed &s;ecure.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, I propo&s;e to the Gentlemen or Elder Brothers, (who have had or now have great E&s;tates) that it is good policy to have two &s;trings to their bow, for it hath been a thing taking very much with wi&s;e men not to adventure all their e&s;tates upon one title, nor in any one County, and their wi&s;dome never appeared &s;o much as in the&s;e di&s;tracted times; for when the enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates, in one County they have

<P>The Ships taking of men by the Pole is extreame Unhealthy, for by this means to make the greater fraught they take &s;o many, that their Ship is pe&s;tured, and &s;ub|ject to di&s;ea&s;es, which hath happened very often.</P>
<P>And they being onely bound to land the Pa&s;&s;engers in <HI>Virginia</HI> at large, or el&s;e in &s;ome particular River; they take no further care, but at the place where they them|&s;elves de&s;ign their Ships to go, they &s;et their Pa&s;&s;engers on land, which many times falls out to be di&s;tant from the Plantations, to which the mo&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers are bound &s;ome thirty, forty, or fifty miles and more, and &s;ome of the Pa&s;&s;engers being &s;ickly at their landing, per|i&s;h before they arrive at their home. And the latter the Ships come to <HI>Virginia</HI> the wor&s;e, for then they are &s;et a

&s;hore in the very &s;trength of Winter, which is about the la&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> and being weake are &s;poiled with cold, whereas if they had been &s;et down at their Plantations, they would &s;oone recover their healths.</P>
<P>The be&s;t and cheape&s;t way for tho&s;e that intend to go at the&s;e time, which for the rea&s;ons afore&s;aid are the wor&s;t, as al&s;o being longe&s;t, in that they go above 200 leagues out of the way, hauling over to the <HI>Azoras</HI> or We&s;terne I&s;lands, for the advantage of the wind.</P>
<P>Let them upon the <HI>Exchange</HI> inquire what Pa&s;&s;engers are going, and there make a con&s;ort&s;hip of tho&s;e who live neare&s;t together in the Countrey, and having made them&s;elves up a con&s;iderable number of thirty or forty, let them then bind the Ma&s;ter to &s;et them downe with his Ship, at or &s;o neere that particular place they de&s;igne to go to, as the Ship can come.</P>
<P>But the better way will be, if they can make up &s;o many Pa&s;&s;engers a will give a Ship a fraught, then to hire a Ship among&s;t them&s;elves, to &s;et them downe at their place in <HI>Virginia,</HI> which will make the Planters &s;tock go further by a third part, then it would doe by tran&s;porting him&s;elf as afore&s;aid; which I demon&s;trate in manner following.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I had 120 Pa&s;&s;engers, and 100 tuns of goods.</P>
<P>I look out for a Ship of 150 Tuns, which will doe it very well, and hire her either by the Month or the Voy|age, which I &s;hall find be&s;t cheap; this Ship I can have for 100. li. a Month, but in re&s;pect they will not let her for a le&s;&s;e time then five or &s;ix Months, and I having no commoditie as yet to relade her home, I will therefore agree for the Voyage outward, and after I am &s;et down, let him make his be&s;t advantage of any imployment he &s;hall meet with, and to performe this &s;ervice I can have him for 300. l. at the mo&s;t, the Owners victualling their owne Company, and finding all things perteining to the Ship; but you may ob&s;erve, if you will take upon you a
<PB N="49" REF="32">
<HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> bottome, &s;he will goe cheaper, which in ca&s;e a Fleet of Ships went together, I would do.</P>
<P>Now for that I have ob&s;erved &s;alt meates which is the Sea diet, doth not &s;o well agree with Land-men, and be&s;ides that manner of victualling is very deare, I &s;hall for the Pa&s;&s;engers propo&s;e a better and more plea&s;ant diet &amp; far cheaper which will not &s;tand you in at above three fourths of the u&s;uall charge.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t I propo&s;e a meat with which the <HI>Dutch</HI> victuall very much, and call it Gruts, which like Oate|meale thickens extreamly in boyling, and being buttered is a very plea&s;ing and &s;atisfying di&s;h, which I have ex|perienced in <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, or otherwi&s;e you may have Rice and a little Spice, with Butter or Bag-Puddings with Plumbs, with a little Fle&s;h, Butter, Chee&s;e, and Fi&s;h, which well proportioned will both plea&s;e and fill the Pa&s;&s;enger; in diet if the mind be &s;atisfie, the &s;tom|acke &s;oone agrees.</P>

By which it is plain all parties very well &s;atisfied, the Planter is not at much above one third part of the u&s;u|all charge.</P>

<P>And of Servants the be&s;t are be&s;t cheape.</P>
<P>Therefore Ile not advice the Spiriting way, which &s;ends Drones to the Hive, in &s;tead of Bees, but that you take &s;tout Labourers and good Worke-men, giving them hone&s;t wages from 3. li. to 10. li. a yeare accord|ing to the quallity of the men, for if we in <HI>England</HI> can pay 2. or 300. li. <HI>per annum</HI> rent for a Farme, and give great wages, we may much better give wages where our ground is twice as good, and no rent paid.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it keepes a Servant in heart, and makes him at all times willing to put forth his &s;trength in that Ma&s;ters &s;ervice, that gives him meanes to thrive, and taking this cour&s;e you may pick and chu&s;e your Ser|vants.</P>
<P>Onely this I mu&s;t advi&s;e, that you agree with your Servant for foure yeares at lea&s;t, and con&s;idering that you pay his pa&s;&s;age, and are at other charges with him,
<PB N="53" REF="34">
let the charge be proportioned upon the foure or more yeares wages that he is to &s;erve you, and &s;o deduct it every yeare.</P>

<P>I will in the fir&s;t place helpe the weake&s;t to avoid the trouble of the &s;tronge&s;t, whom I &s;uppo&s;e may have three pound the fir&s;t yeare, and pre&s;uming for that he went well cloathed out of <HI>England,</HI> it will be all his owne at the yeares end, with this three pound Ile buy him a Haifer, and &s;end twenty &s;hillings of it into <HI>England</HI> in &s;ome commoditie of the Countrey, as to &s;ay three or foure flitches of Bacon or the like, which he may well doe with twenty &s;hillings and more; and for that the Bacon of <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;eth our <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> which I have often experimented here in <HI>England,</HI> I doubt not but at the lea&s;t (for I love to value all things of this nature at the lea&s;t) it will yeeld him eight groates a &s;tone, and &s;uppo&s;ing his foure flitches way but twenty &s;tone which they'le doe (and ten more) he hath here in <HI>England</HI> for his Bacon two pound three &s;hillings foure pence, and this lade out in Pins, Laces, &amp; Combes, for the Maids &s;hall in <HI>Virginia</HI> be double, and now his Cow hath Caved, and he hath five pound in his pur&s;e, be&s;ides his yeares wages to receive, which tells him he hath now &s;erved his Ma&s;ter two yeares.</P>

<P>ANd when I con&s;ider this way hath been attempt|ed but the &s;ucce&s;&s;e: for by it divers hone&s;t men
<PB N="55" REF="35">
have been lo&s;t, I &s;hall let love alone to worke with Chri&s;tians, for with <HI>Indians</HI> it cannot, &s;ince there mu&s;t be an acquaintance to procure familiaritie upon which tru&s;t and confidence is repo&s;ed, which is the common foundation of love, but the <HI>Indians</HI> being a wild people and of a &s;ubtill and treacherous nature, as &s;ad experience tell us we mu&s;t not acquaint our &s;elves with them to tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Next I will con&s;ider force and that hath bin fatall to the <HI>Indians,</HI> there having beene great numbers of them &s;laine.</P>
<P>And this will not doe till they be wholy vanqui&s;hed, which is a worke (although a &s;mall number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> may, and can deale with great numbers of <HI>(Indians</HI> not, to be effected, but with a va&s;t expence both of money and time, in re&s;pect of the largene&s;&s;e of the Conti|nent, wherein the Countrey is, being much bigger then many <HI>Englands, Scotlands</HI> and <HI>Irelands</HI> together.</P>
<P>Wherefore and for that this cour&s;e agrees not with the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall not think of it.</P>
<P>I will therefore con&s;ider of a third way, in which (not leaving our dependance upon God for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance) I &s;hall look upon nature.</P>
<P>And I will examine the ordinary cour&s;e of taming wild and fierce bea&s;ts, the&s;e differing from them in no|thing, but that they are endued with naturall rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, the more you thwart nature, the fiercer you make it: And therefore we are fir&s;t to &s;tudy, what they are mo&s;t enclined to: and having found it, then to fit them with tho&s;e things they naturally are delighted in, and &s;o by degrees you take from them all feare; which is the principall ab&s;tacle, and at la&s;t reclaime them: this is enough for the Generall.</P>
<P>Now to come to our wilde people, who being en|dued with naturall rea&s;on, I doubt not, but they may more ea&s;ily reelamed.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="36">
Fir&s;t, therefore I will inquire what mo&s;t predommi|nates in nature, and I find ambition to be to the princ|pall marke that nature aymes at.</P>
<P>For all men are naturally ambitious either of know|ledge, honour, or of wealth, to attaine which the great|e&s;t dangers har&s;he&s;t &s;tudies and the harde&s;t labours are made plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Therefore we mu&s;t make u&s;e of ambition being the univer&s;all net of nature to take the&s;e men.</P>
<P>Now let us looke what it is that drawes us to this net and we &s;hall find it to be a &s;ence of our own naked|ne&s;&s;e, and it was the ca&s;e of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Evah</HI> our fir&s;t Parents, wherefore I &s;hall &s;ay, that if the Devill could by this meanes worke upon them, to &s;o bad an end, God will a&s;&s;i&s;tus by the &s;ame meanes (&s;ince it is to a better end) to work upon the&s;e it being to his glory.</P>
<P>Now in order to the reclaming of the&s;e men we mu&s;t con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that they are ignorantly naked in the know|ledge of all things, but what they are prompt to by na|ture for &s;elfe pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the Countrey affording plenty of pro|vi&s;ions to &s;u&s;taine nature, they take little care for the future.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that being thus provided, they &s;eeke not nor care for comerce.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that for the rea&s;ons afore&s;aid they are in|dependent upon any other people, and care not to con|verce with any but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Wherefore if ever they be reclaimed it mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by making them &s;en&s;ible of their nakedne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly, By taking them off from their confidence upon nature, whereby they may take care for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that they may de&s;ire comerce.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that they may be brought to depend.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="36">
And for that they cannot be talkt into a &s;ight of them&s;elves, I &s;hall propo&s;e that we gently &s;teal through their nature, till we can come to pull off the &s;cale from their eyes, that they may &s;ee their owne nakedne&s;&s;e; which mu&s;t be done in manner following.</P>
<P>Either by making them ambitious of Honour, or by making them ambitious of Riches.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t we mu&s;t take their Werowances or great men: they already being at that lock of being one better then another.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd, let us not doubt but we &s;hall take them all, for there is but a very few men in the World either Chri&s;tian or Heathan, that are not taken with it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;hall advi&s;e that &s;light Jewells be made at the publique charge of thirty or forty &s;hillings price, and one better then the re&s;t, of &s;ome &s;uch toyes as they &s;hall mo&s;t affect, which fitted with Ribands to weare about their necks or their heads, as their cu&s;tome a|mong&s;t them is; &s;halbe &s;ent from the Governour of the Plantation in his own, and al&s;o in the name of the People and the Governour to di&s;tingui&s;h them by &s;ome pretty titles, which &s;hould be alwaies after ob&s;erved; as al&s;o to make &s;ome of them favourites, and to &s;ollicite their preferment with their King, &amp; this by degrees will kindle the fire of Ambition, which once in a flame mu&s;t be fed, and then is the time to worke.</P>
<P>For the &s;econd I &s;hall advi&s;e, that their nature be ob&s;erved what way it mo&s;t poynts at, and then fit them with what they mo&s;t de&s;ire, and if by degrees you can bring &s;ome of them to weare &s;light loo&s;e Garments in Summer, or to keep them warme in the Winter; which if you can effect, the worke is halfe done, and this I am confident is very ea&s;ie: for a little to the North|ward of the place I write of, they are fallen into a way of cloathing them&s;elves without cour&s;e <HI>Welch</HI> cloath of

Blew and Red colours, and the better &s;ort of the <HI>In|dians</HI> in this place do weare Coats of Skinnes, with the Furre &s;ide next to their bodyes in the Winter, and the Skin &s;ide in the Summer: and that you may perceive them already comming, they have for the mo&s;t part al|tered their old Fa&s;hion, of making their Coats, and now in imitation, make them like <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloakes; but this mu&s;t be at the publick charge, they having few valuable Commodities to purcha&s;e them, yet the charge will not be great, for I &s;hall advi&s;e that this be not practi&s;ed up|on the generallity, but upon &s;ome one King and his People that are mo&s;t tractable, and of the neare&s;t neig|bourhood, and they are commonly about two hundred or two hundred and fifty <HI>Indians,</HI> and five or &s;ix &s;hil|lings a man will do it; be&s;ides, there will be &s;omething to retribute the charge, <HI>viz.</HI> Beaver, Otter, and other Skinnes, <HI>Indian</HI> Corne, Beanes, and Pea&s;e, with other things, &s;o that it is po&s;&s;ible the charge may be defrayed, and having won the&s;e, you need not fear the comming in of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The poore <HI>Indian</HI> being cloathed, his &s;ight is cleared, he &s;ees him&s;elfe naked, and you'le finde him in the &s;nare.</P>
<P>For now they begin to vye who is the better man, which mu&s;t be determined by their Cloathes, and to purcha&s;e them, they'le be at their wits end, &s;ince they have nothing valuable, and if you draw the net wi&s;ely they are &s;ure.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that although their minds be fetter'd, yet their nature is not tamd, wherefore you mu&s;t thinke of propo&s;ing &s;ome thing to them, that may inable them to be Ma&s;ters of Cloathes, which mu&s;t in no wayes trench upon their liberties.</P>
<P>Therefore in the fir&s;t place you may propo&s;e ea&s;ie workes, and draw them on by degrees, and you &s;hall finde, that for them&s;elves they will worke, but not for you.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="37">
You &s;hall likewi&s;e propo&s;e to their King, that if hee'l &s;end thirty or forty men to helpe in your Harve&s;t, hee &s;hall have a Cloake, or Breeches and Doublet, or the like, and his men &s;hould have every one &s;ome|thing.</P>
<P>Or otherwi&s;e, &s;et them to peeling of Hempe, or brak|ing of Flax in Winter, where they &s;hould for the pre|&s;ent, to incourage them, have more then they earned, and then bring them to drive the Plough, or thre&s;h Corne, or the like, but in no wi&s;e let them continue at any one worke to a di&s;like, but play with them, you &s;till fitting varietie of workes to their fancies; thus by degrees (God a&s;&s;i&s;ting) you &s;hall make them con|quer them&s;elves: by this meanes in two or three yeares you will draw them to a confidence in you, to tru&s;t their Children to be brought up by you, and they'l learne <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which will be a good &s;tep to bring them to Chri&s;tianitie. Having brought them thus farre, you need not be directed how to leade them further, your owne rea&s;on and profit will doe it; never feare their fal|ling back, for their owne ends &s;hall keepe them to you, becau&s;e their minds will prompt them to pride, and they'l cover to be finer then their fellowes.</P>
<P>And now have you opened their eyes, made them care for the future, drawn them to commerce, and made them depend.</P>
<P>And in the end, by Gods mercy to them, make them good Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Thus have I done with the <HI>Indians:</HI> onely this take notice of, I do not advi&s;e that at any hand you &s;uffer them to come into your hou&s;e, or any further then your field or out-working hou&s;es, neither admit more of them to come then you can ma&s;ter, and that they alwayes come without their armes, untill you &s;ee them &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their poverty, that they come nece&s;i|tated to worke.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now to advi&s;e the Adventurer, Planter, and Ser|vant, of &s;uch things as are proper to them.</P>
<P>Having before advi&s;ed of the mi&s;chiefe of procuring of Servants, and of the convenience and inconvenience of the u&s;uall pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and how to prevent the inconveniency, as al&s;o of a better way of pa&s;&s;age, and like wi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of your &s;elfe in the Countrey when you come fir&s;t there, and what commodities to fall pre&s;ently upon, I &s;hall now advi&s;e.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fir&s;t to the Adventurer.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, that what&s;oever his de&s;igne be, not to depend upon the life of any one man for the perfecting the worke, but to &s;end two at the lea&s;t of equall abilitie, and one to &s;ucceed the other in ca&s;e of death.</P>
<P>Secondly, that for what&s;oever belongeth to Art, that it be here made in <HI>England,</HI> lea&s;t when the worke comes over, none be found there able to do it, and &s;o it pe|ri&s;h, or if there be any principall in it, that may be indan|gered to be lo&s;t or broken, that he &s;end two of the &s;ame for feare of falling.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that if there be Parteners in the bu&s;ines, they &s;o Article that the fayler to &s;upply his part, &s;hall for|feit it to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, what&s;oever the de&s;igne be, yet &s;end over a Plough or two, for this if their de&s;igne faile, or untill the de&s;igne be perfected, will turne to accompt, and make them great gainers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Secondly to the Planter.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, that they take the Planters leave where for the pre&s;ent they &s;hall re&s;ide, and doe not neglect the
<PB N="61" REF="38">
opportunitie of falling into the ground with the Plough &s;o &s;oone as the &s;ea&s;ons come.</P>
<P>Secondly, that when the Corne is in the ground, then <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chu&s;ing of ground.</NOTE> is the time to looke out for the place, they &s;hall after &s;ettle them&s;elves upon, in which they mu&s;t take care not to &s;ettle on the places neere the ebbing and flow|ing of the &s;alt water, for they are there, as here in <HI>Eng|land</HI> all agui&s;h, next that they make choice of &s;ome place neere a navigable River, where they may have the conveniency of fre&s;h Mar&s;hes, Meadows, and Fi&s;h, and if they can where &s;ome plea&s;ant ri&s;ing Hills be, but at no rate doe not &s;trugle too farre from Neighbours, for that's di&s;con&s;olate.</P>
<P>Thirdly, let them build their Hou&s;es of Brick, or o|therwi&s;e with Timber, let it be done with &s;ub&s;tantiall <NOTE PLACE="marg">Building of Hou&s;es.</NOTE> compleat lengths (&s;ince they have Timber enough) which will &s;ave halfe charges in Carpenters worke, line it on the in&s;ide thick with Loame, and cover it with Lime, for that will make it warme in Winter, make your modell or plate-forme &s;uch that when your family &s;hall increa&s;e you may adde to your buildings without defacing or inconveniencing any roomes.</P>
<P>Fourthly, examine the ground and &s;owe proper &s;eed in the proper parts, &s;owe not Wheat in the riche&s;t, for <NOTE PLACE="marg">What &s;eed to &s;owe, &amp; upon what ground.</NOTE> that will be too rich, and will not turne to accompt, but in your riche&s;t &s;owe Rape, Rice, or Flax-&s;eed, and two or three crops of this, will bring the ground to beare Wheat your life after.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> chu&s;e good Servants, able Worke-men; and give them good wages, fear not the wages: of every <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carrying of Servants.</NOTE> ten Servants let foure be Boyes, and ever after &s;end for good lu&s;ty Youths, for they will &s;erve eight or nine yeares, whereas men will hardly be gotten to &s;erve a|bove four or five, and taking this cour&s;e the Boyes wil be Men when the Mens times expire, and being trayned up in the &s;ervice under good men, they will prove excel|lent Servants.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="39">
Fifthly, That the &s;ervants may do their work with|out trouble in over-&s;eeing, or without fretting or vex|ing their Ma&s;ters patience, I &s;hall advi&s;e &s;uch a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Servants re|ward.</NOTE> way, as they may worke for them&s;elves, and their Ma|&s;ters together for be well a&s;&s;ured, the be&s;t of them; will work more to get them&s;elves a Shilling, then to get you ten, and that they may with much content, and profit to them&s;elves, make their Servants &s;hew the be&s;t of their abilities, it were good to con&s;ider what or how much of any worke to be done by a Servant in a day would be &s;atisfactory, and then that being done, he &s;hould have an allowance for what he &s;hould do more. As for Example; two &s;tone, or two &s;tone and a half of Flax to be dre&s;t in a day is indifferent, I would then give him foure pence a &s;tone, for what he &s;hould do more: this will extreamly incourage the Servant, and very good u&s;e may be made of it, or let him have the remainder of the day to plant a little Tobacco for him&s;elfe, or for any other thing; I have tried all wayes, but never found the like.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That for &s;uch Servants as are above the age of twenty yeares, who can de&s;erve wages in <HI>England,</HI> give them wages in manner following, <HI>viz.</HI> three pound the fir&s;t yeare, and &s;o increa&s;e the wages twenty &s;hil|ings a year to the end of their time.</P>
<P>Seventhly, and for youths, when they &s;hall attain to the age of twenty one years, to give wages, and in|crea&s;ing to the end of their time, in manner afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Eighthly, and to undertake to give the Servants. 30 actes of land, at the end of their time, to them and their heirs for ever: which land &s;hall be given the Ma&s;ter, by the Court, for them.</P>
<P>Ninthly, That they agree with Artificers for &s;hares.</P>
<P>Tenthly, that they enquire after all advantagious Commodities that are produced from the Earth, and learn how to bring them to perfection.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, that they enquire after all manner of
<PB N="63" REF="39">
&s;light Engines, that will &s;ave hand-labour, there being nothing dear in the Countrey but labour.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, and for that the Ma&s;ters will be at charge of tran&s;porting and cloathing them; let that charge be deducted proportionably every year out of their wages.</P>
<P>Thirteenthly, they mu&s;t be carefull to Covenant with their Servants, to forfeit for every dayes work they &s;hall neglect, double the value of their dayes labour: but for neglect in harve&s;t, ten times the value.</P>
<P>Fourteenthly, the difference that may ari&s;e between the Ma&s;ter and Servant, upon their Covenants, to be de|termined by the Superintendents.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, They mu&s;t &s;hew their Servants Indentures to the Court, and then they &s;hall have 50 Acres of land for every &s;ervant &s;etled upon them, and their heirs for ever, which fifty Acres, is over and above what the Servants &s;hall have.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For Servants.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, they to Covenant with their Ma&s;ters, not to plant above two hundred weight of Tobacco <HI>per an|num:</HI> whereas heretofore a Servant planted 1500.</P>
<P>Secondly, this will take off all mens depending on Tobacco, which hath been the fatall commodity of that Countrey, and Ma&s;ters will find a better way to employ their Servants.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that they looke their Ma&s;ters Covenant, to give them thirty. Acres of land, and pay them the wages they &s;hall agree for in money, or the Commo|dity of the Countrey, money worth.</P>
<P>Fourthly, let the Servant agree with his Ma&s;ter upon the &s;um laid our for him before his tran&s;portation, that he be not abu&s;ed therein when he contes into the Coun|trey, and let the &s;ame be &s;et down in the Indentures.</P>
<P>Fifthly, this carefully ob&s;erved, with the rules be|fore pre&s;cribed in this book, will a&s;&s;ure the Servant, that at the end of his time, he &s;hall be in a flouri&s;h|ing condition, never more to &s;erve any man.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="40">
A &s;ingle man that can but pay his pa&s;&s;age, may have ten pound a yeare for his &s;ervice, and be found meat and drink.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if any Gentlemen or others with their Fa|milies, and al&s;o Artificers in any Trade, Labourers or Servants &s;hall be de&s;irous to tran&s;port them&s;elves for the bettering of their fortunes, either to this place, or any other of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations abroad, let them repair to the Authour, who for the love he bears his Countrey, will freely advi&s;e them how to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves for their greate&s;t advantage, which &s;hall in|able them to do much more with one hundred pounds then they could heretofore do for one hundred and fifty pound, of which benefit the Planter &s;hall al&s;o have the Advantage, and Servants &s;hall be upon &s;ure termes knowing their work, and their conditions, and they &s;hall &s;ee plainly that in a little time, they &s;hall by Gods ble&s;&s;ing, become men of good e&s;tates, he will al&s;o advi&s;e how they may tran&s;port them&s;elves with the be&s;t &s;afety in the&s;e times, from any danger of being taken.</P>
<P>And if any Gentlemen that &s;hall not go them&s;elves, but are de&s;irous to adventure, he will direct them how they may be&s;t di&s;po&s;e thereof for their advantage, and that in eighteen Moneths they &s;hall be reimbur&s;ed their principally money, and after &s;hall, con&s;tantly receive much above fifty pound for every hundred pound they adventured at fir&s;t, and owners of Ships &s;hall have good imployment, for their Ships not letting them lie rotting by the Walls, as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"> now and heretofore they have done. The Authour is &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e offers are &s;omething large, yet let no man doubt of the truth thereof, the being inabled thereto by his deare bought experience, and all men may be &s;atisfied, that it hath been rarely found, that any one particular good work hath been faln upon, but &s;ome one man hath
<PB N="65" REF="40">
originally been the Authour, or the originall motion hath proceeded from one mans brea&s;t. Tho&s;e rich Mines of the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> were fir&s;t offered by one man to <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh: but he not having faith enough to believe, or not willing to venture a little money to be &s;atisfied of the truth, refu&s;ed it: and after, it was of|fered by the &s;ame man to the then King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who hearkened to him; and all the world knowes, that from this one mans motion, the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have within this 150 yeares received from thence many thou&s;and millions of pounds: be&s;ides, it hath extreamly in|riched the Gentlemen, and Merchants of that Kingdom. Many of the like examples might be &s;hew|ed, but they are &s;o generally known to all men, that Ile &s;ay no more, onely that there was &s;ome time &s;pent, after the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had &s;et footing in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> before he could come by travell to the Mynes; and the&s;e places the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have inhabited much more time then the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Subjects had done in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> before they di&s;covered that Countries wealth. But God, that is the Au|thour of all good things, hath not in all this time beene plea&s;ed to let any man looke further then Tobacco; and no man can &s;ay, but that he is now plea&s;ed freely to offer his ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed upon the&s;e Countries, in the riches thereof, to us, &s;ince all this time, there was never any man that had the heart to labour for the Generall good in this nature before.</P>
<P>Reader I cannot let thee goe till I have againe put thee in mind of my Epi&s;tle to thee, in which I di&s;covered the great Ob&s;tructor of this Countries pro&s;peritie; who I know being now againe alarm'd, will fiercely &s;end his Spirits abroad with lyes and calumnies to abate the peo|ples courage, &s;ince his Kingdom will be &s;o much indan|gered, by the through planting of this place with Chri|&s;tians;

and I am confident he &s;hall no longer prevaile: for my Spirit would not let me re&s;t, till I had by this, bid defiance to him and all his &s;ubtill practi&s;es.</P>
<P>Therefore be not led by any fal&s;e reports, for thou &s;halt find me ready with all freene&s;&s;e to give thee full &s;atisfaction in the truths that any way concernes this Place, or is conteined in this Book; and this I freely offer to men of all conditions, whether Ma&s;ters or Servants.
