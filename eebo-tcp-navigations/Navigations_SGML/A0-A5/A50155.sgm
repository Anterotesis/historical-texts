<P>If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, Thou and thy Fathers Hou&s;e &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TIS well known, that the late <HI>Me|thods</HI> of this weekly and ancient LECTURE, have been, to in&s;i&s;t fir&s;t on the Affairs of a &s;incere CONVERSION, and then on the Duties of a pious CONVERSATION. Having di&s;|patched the <HI>former,</HI> we are now entertaining
<PB N="2" REF="3"> you with our our Di&s;cour&s;es and Directions on the latter. And you mu&s;t Indulge me this Digre&s;&s;ion, that the fre&s;h News of our <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> which within this four and twenty Hours arrived unto us, have diverted my Thoughts to <HI>That</HI> which you may behold this Text pointing at.</P>
<P>I could not <HI>altogether hold my peace at this time,</HI> without ob&s;e ving, that we have as ma|ny <HI>Duties</HI> as we have <HI>Objects</HI> to be concerned with. But as one of the <HI>Objects</HI> which we often have before us, is, <HI>The People of God placed in very terrible Di&s;tre&s;s, and Danger;</HI> thus among the <HI>Duties</HI> then expected from us, none of the lea&s;t Remarkable and Con&s;iderable is, <HI>The venturing of our All, in the &s;ervice of that holy People.</HI> Such was the <HI>Object,</HI> and &s;uch the <HI>Duty</HI> which our Text refers unto. The peo|ple of God, had their <HI>All</HI> now ju&s;t <HI>going</HI> to be <HI>gone,</HI> and a great per&s;on is here called upon to venture <HI>All,</HI> for the &s;ervice of this People that were thus Expiring.</P>
<P>The words now read, are a me&s;&s;age &s;ent by a Renowned <HI>Mordecai,</HI> to the Empre&s;s of the World. The whole Book of <HI>E&s;ther</HI> is a commentary upon one Ver&s;e in the &s;even|teenth of <HI>Exodus;</HI> and that part of it which we are now upon, claims a particular &s;hare of the Expo&s;ition. But we mu&s;t Praeface our Di&s;cour&s;e upon it, with a <HI>few,</HI> and but a few,
<PB N="3" REF="3"> Remarks upon the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Mordecai,</HI> that we may <HI>feel</HI> whereabouts we are. Know then that <HI>Mordecai</HI> was a Famous, an Aged, and an Holy Jew. He had been carried into Cap|tivity, with <HI>Jeconiah,</HI> above &s;eventy years be|fore. And he <HI>Returned</HI> to, and <HI>Re&s;ided</HI> at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> till the work of the <HI>Temple</HI> received its unhappy interruption: but then he <HI>Retired</HI> that he might &s;erve his People in the Court of <HI>Aha&s;huerus</HI> (who was al&s;o called <HI>Artax|erxes</HI>) there: A very laudable Example! 'twas the effect and effort of a mo&s;t noble genero&s;i|ty, in a worthy Man, when his opportunities to <HI>Do good</HI> were &s;hut up at home, thus to ex|po&s;e him&s;elf unto all the Temptations of a <HI>Princes Court,</HI> that he might there be &s;ervice, able to the People of God.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Mordecai</HI> gives a great affront un|to one <HI>Haman,</HI> a Minion in the Court of <HI>Per|&s;ia.</HI> That <HI>Haman</HI> by his Brigues, had obtain|ed from the Per&s;ian Emperour, a Commi&s;&s;ion and Priviledg to require a more than common Reverence from the Courtiers then about the Palace. But this good man found it again&s;t his Con&s;cience to take &s;uch a notice of &s;uch a Mi&s;creant. The &s;cruple aro&s;e in him, either from <HI>This;</HI> That <HI>Haman</HI> was an <HI>Amalekite</HI> he was among the Children of that <HI>Agog,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;lew; and &s;o of a Generation both <HI>accur&s;ed</HI> by God, and no le&s;s ju&s;tly that
<PB N="4" REF="4"> greatly <HI>Abhorred</HI> by <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> or which I rather Think, from <HI>This,</HI> That it was a <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Sacred</HI> Re&s;pect, which <HI>Haman</HI> did now require. Such was the re&s;pect which the haughty and impious Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> would &s;ometimes arrogate unto them&s;elves; and they would &s;ometimes impart the &s;ame unto their Para|&s;ites and Favourites. Had it been a meer civil re&s;pect which was here demanded, it would have been very <HI>&s;uperfluous</HI> and well nigh <HI>ridiculous</HI> to have given expre&s;s com|mand unto all <HI>the Kings Servants that were in the Court</HI> concerning it; good manners were doubtle&s;s enough u&s;ed there. Now that a godly <HI>Jew</HI> &s;hould refu&s;e to render &s;uch an Honour to a &s;orry <HI>Pot&s;heard of the Earth,</HI> is not at to be wondred at, when we call to mind, That even the prudent, but pagan <HI>Grecians</HI> did refu&s;e it, in their Addre&s;s to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchs; and the <HI>Athenians</HI> put one <HI>Timocrates</HI> to death, for adoring of <HI>Darius</HI> in &s;uch a manner. Such a check was given to the pride of <HI>Haman!</HI> Now the bloody Re|venge of this Helli&s;h Mon&s;ter prompted him to pur&s;ue no meaner a &s;atisfaction for this in|dignity, than the utter <HI>De&s;olation</HI> and <HI>Extirpa|tion,</HI> of the whole Nation which <HI>Mordecai</HI> was of: one Lark will not fill the belly of &s;uch a <HI>Vulture.</HI> Be&s;ides he &s;aw the whole Nation was of &s;uch <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ions</HI> in Re|ligion,
<PB N="5" REF="4"> as gave a reproof to his wicked practi|ces; an intolerable Nation was it that would know no God, but the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and with whom <HI>Creature-Wor&s;hip</HI> was now grown into Dete&s;tation: and therefore he procures an order for the total De&s;truction of all the Jews, to be executed, according to the advice which he &s;ought of the <HI>Divel</HI> for it, about this time of the year; and I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Anno mundi</HI> 3485.</P>
<P>Perhaps, the <HI>Jews</HI> were before this, grown a little too &s;ecure and carele&s;s: it might fill them with many promi&s;es of none but <HI>Good Times</HI> for them, when they &s;aw one of their own Religion &s;itting on the Throne. More|over, The <HI>Jews</HI> had every where offended the God of Heaven, by neglecting of His Ordi|nances for the &s;ake of their own Secular Ac|commodations. But we now all of the &s;ud|den &s;ee them that were the <HI>only people of God in the world,</HI> involved in mo&s;t Awakening and Horrible Calamities; and they have a pro&s;|pect of Nothing but a Speedy, a pre&s;ent <HI>Ru|ine</HI> before their Eyes. 'Twas by &s;omething bigger than a <HI>Wonder,</HI> that the People of God were now pre&s;erved!</P>
<P>A Strange Providence had exalted a Kin&s;|woman of <HI>Mordecai's,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> to be the Queen of the Per&s;ian Empire; and &s;he mu&s;t be the In&s;trument of the pre&s;ervation.
<PB N="6" REF="5"> In order hereunto, we find in our Context, a very &s;olemn Me&s;&s;age of her Uncle to her; in which we may Contemplate,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a <HI>Duty.</HI> The Duty pre&s;&s;ed is, To <HI>venture All for the Re&s;cue of them that were the Afflicted People of God.</HI> The Thing Enjoined upon <HI>E&s;ther</HI> was, <HI>Go in unto the King, and make Supplication for thy people.</HI> This was the only &s;tep that could be taken for &s;aving the People of God: but it was one very de&s;perate and perillous. There was a cur&s;ed and a crabbed <HI>Law</HI> among them, which made it capital for any uncalled per&s;on to come into the <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> of the King, unle&s;s it &s;hould plea&s;e His pow|erful and Soveraign Maje&s;ty to Extend His <HI>Golden Scepter,</HI> as a Token of a Pardon for that pre&s;umption. Wherefore now to pu&s;h into the pre&s;ence of the King, was to ru&s;h more evidently upon the point of a <HI>Sharp Sword,</HI> than of a <HI>Golden Scepter;</HI> it was to hazard the Lo&s;s of <HI>All;</HI> not only a <HI>Crown,</HI> but a <HI>Life</HI> too mu&s;t be ventured in it. And the late Carriages of the Emperour unto <HI>E&s;t|her,</HI> could not but increa&s;e her Su&s;picions and Jealou&s;ies that his Affections began to be A|lienated from her; whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h made the Under|taking yet more Dubious, Dangerous, and Formidable. However, &s;till this was the Charge of the good <HI>Mordecai, If All mu&s;t be ventured, then venture All; when the People of
<PB N="7" REF="5"> God are peri&s;hing, All that we have, is too little to be ventured for their Help.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, A <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> The Rea&s;on is, like a good <HI>Sawce</HI> made up of <HI>Sowre</HI> and <HI>Sweet.</HI> It is made up of <HI>Di&s;cords,</HI> and there is a no|table <HI>Mu&s;ick</HI> in it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We have <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for this venture mentioned. Says <HI>Mordecai</HI> to his Neece, <HI>Think not that thou &s;halt e&s;cape.</HI> He &s;peaks to her, as to a Pa&s;&s;enger Embark'd in the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el. Says he, <HI>Don't think that you &s;hall not &s;hare with, and fare like, the re&s;t of the people of God, that are now ready to be &s;wallowed up</HI> It was more probable, that the <HI>Queen</HI> would &s;uffer for being a <HI>Jew,</HI> than that the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;hould e&s;cape for being a <HI>Queen.</HI> Being a <HI>Queen,</HI> has been found not enough to put a per&s;on beyond the Reach of Malice and En|vy; as the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> and the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Navarre,</HI> be&s;ides nearer in&s;tances, have a&s;|&s;ured us. A Lively venture for the People of God, was once, it &s;eems, the only way to de|fend a <HI>Royal</HI> per&s;on from every fatal mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>But Secondly, We have <HI>Encouragement</HI> for this Venture tendered Says <HI>Mordecai</HI> with a Magnanimous Faith. <HI>If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, there &s;hall Enlargement and Deliverance ari&s;e from another place.</HI> Here was that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which, as the Apo&s;tle notes, the Believers of old, <HI>E&s;caped the Edge of the Sword.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P><HI>From another place.</HI> There are Jewi&s;h Rab|bins who look upon <HI>Place,</HI> here to be the Name of God. It has been admired, that the Name of GOD, is no where to be &s;een in the Book of <HI>E&s;ther;</HI> and the Jews have a profane and fooli&s;h Cu&s;tome thereupon. But indeed, as the Greeks would write <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">.</P>
<P><GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, upon their Books, much more may we &s;ee <HI>God</HI> in every ver&s;e, <HI>God</HI> in every line of this Memorable Book. If the Name of <HI>Makom,</HI> or, <HI>Place</HI> be here put upon our God, it is not without a cau&s;e: For, <HI>All things are in God;</HI> He is Immen&s;e and Boundle&s;s in His Being; we cannot &s;o well &s;ay, <HI>That God is in the World,</HI> as, <HI>That the World is in Him;</HI> and whether it be proper or no, to &s;ay, That God is even in the <HI>Imaginary Space</HI> beyond the <HI>utmo&s;t Selvidge</HI> of the World, this I am &s;ure of, That the <HI>Utmo&s;t Selvedge</HI> of the World does not limit and confine this infi|nite God, and the <HI>Heaven of Heavens cannot Contain Him.</HI> 'Tis therefore &s;ugge&s;ted here, That when the People of God can have no <HI>place</HI> of Safety, but are in every <HI>place</HI> obnox|ious to dreadful Per&s;ecutions, yet then, in their <HI>GOD</HI> they will have a <HI>place</HI> to repair unto. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, That this Glorious PLACE may keep the wor&s;t of all their E|nemies from coming at them?</P>
<P>But what is the Duty <HI>then</HI> incumbent upon
<PB REF="6"> <HI>our &s;elves.</HI> You have heard it in the <HI>Text</HI> and you &s;hall again hear it, in our <HI>Doctrine,</HI> thereupon; which is briefly <HI>This.</HI></P>
<Q>That every Chri&s;tian &s;hould Readily and Chearfully <HI>Venture</HI> his All to to &s;erve the people of God, when a <HI>Time of Di&s;tre&s;s and Danger</HI> cal|leth for it.</Q>
<P>It had been both <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI> and <HI>Injurious</HI> to have Exhorted <HI>E&s;tther</HI> unto doing &s;o, if it had not been a Duty altogether indi&s;pen&s;able. The Ble&s;&s;ed God, for mo&s;t wi&s;e and great <HI>Ends,</HI> permits <HI>Times of Di&s;tre&s;s and Danger</HI> to come upon His people. That <HI>His Attributes</HI> may be Magnified, and that both His and Their <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> may be prepared for the Vengeance, which belongs unto them, There|fore 'tis that the mo&s;t High brings His Peo|ple &s;ometimes into mo&s;t amazing Exigencies; 'tis for the&s;e cau&s;es, that they not rarely fall into &s;uch <HI>Times of Di&s;tre&s;s and Danger,</HI> that like them in the Days of <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> they Ly <HI>mourning and weeping and wailing in Sackcloth and A&s;hes,</HI> before the Lord; and they &s;ee them&s;elves no where but upon the prodigious
<PB N="10" REF="7"> praecipices of Rumes hardly to be avoided.</P>
<P>In <HI>&s;uch</HI> a condition of Affairs (which is too much <HI>our own</HI> Condition) &s;omething mu&s;t be done; <HI>Attempts</HI> mu&s;t be made for the Relief and Re&s;cue, of the <HI>People</HI> &s;o likely to be cut off. Tho' it becomes us to, <HI>Stand &s;till, and &s;ee the Salvation of God,</HI> I do not know that we are to <HI>&s;it &s;till,</HI> without the u&s;e of Means under our Di&s;couragements. But the&s;e <HI>Attempts</HI> can't be made without <HI>Ventures</HI> in them. 'Tis as po&s;&s;ible they may mi&s;carry, as that they may be &s;ucce&s;sful. However, we mu&s;t yet <HI>venture</HI> hard, and <HI>Venture</HI> far, yea, and Venture <HI>All,</HI> to &s;erve the People of God, in their <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Danger. If at THIS TIME thou altogether</HI> forbear, and refrain, the doing of what may be &s;erviceable to the Di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed People of God, behold with an Holy Terror, the Doom upon that Omi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Thou and thy Hou&s;e &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</HI></P>
<P>We have two <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> before us, to be a little Reflected on.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>What,</HI> And</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Why,</HI> we mu&s;t <HI>Venture</HI> for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People of God.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of our Que&s;tions, is,</P>
<P><HI>What Ventures are we to make for the People of God, when Di&s;tre&s;s or Danger calls?</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t make <HI>&s;hort work</HI> of it, and in <HI>One Word</HI> compri&s;e what is to be &s;aid. I &s;ay then,</P>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<P><HI>We are to Venture every Thing in the world, but a precious and immortal Soul.</HI> So did <HI>E&s;ther</HI> our Pattern. There is no Jewel, but that one of a never dying <HI>Soul,</HI> too valuable to be ventured, when God and His People is to be &s;erved. The fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on, the A. B. C. of Chri&s;tianity, is that in <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.24. <HI>Let a man Deny him&s;elf.</HI> We are &s;o to <HI>Deny</HI> out &s;elves, as to <HI>Venture</HI> our &s;elves, and <HI>All</HI> that we <HI>Are,</HI> and All that we <HI>Have,</HI> to &s;erve the <HI>People of the Saints of the Mo&s;t High.</HI> But becau&s;e you Look to &s;ee &s;ome particulars in the <HI>Bill of Charges</HI> which the Di&s;tre&s;s &amp; Danger of Gods People, may put upon you, Let me &s;ay;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We mu&s;t venture our <HI>Quiet,</HI> for the People of God. It was the Speech of a Gallant Man, in 2 Sam. 11.11. <HI>The Ark and I&s;rael and Judah abide in Tents, and my Lord Joab, and the Servants of my Lord are Encamped in the open fields; &s;hall</HI> I <HI>then go into my hou&s;e, to Eat and to Drink&mdash;I will not do this thing,</HI> Well &s;aid, thou brave <HI>Hero!</HI> May we in like manner &s;corn to Con&s;ult the Delights and Plea&s;ures of our own Repo&s;e, when the Ser|vice of God and His People &s;hall call us forth. Many <HI>Pains,</HI> many <HI>Toyls,</HI> and all the uncom|fortable Fatigues of <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t be Encoun|tred, without Reluctancies, when the People of God are to be &s;erved; and we &s;hould for|&s;ake
<PB N="12" REF="8"> our &s;oft Beds, our full <HI>Tables,</HI> and our Fine <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> for the &s;ake thereof. We &s;hould engage in the Service of our Genera|tion, tho' there &s;hould be two <HI>Hankerchiefs</HI> which we are thereby nece&s;&s;itated unto the continual wearing of; One to wipe off the <HI>Sweat</HI> of Labour and another to wipe off the <HI>Dirt</HI> of Reproach. We may not, for the Love of <HI>Ea&s;e,</HI> decline the doing of what is to be done for the Intere&s;t of God, and of His People.</P>
<P>Again, We mu&s;t venture our <HI>E&s;tate</HI> for the People of God. It is Recorded for the ever|la&s;ting Reputation of tho&s;e well-di&s;po&s;ed men, in 2 Cor. 8.2 <HI>Their deep Poverty, a|bounded unto the Riches of Liberali?y,</HI> or <HI>Sim|plicity,</HI> as it may be rendred. Many per&s;ons can do nothing in a way of Service for the People of God, becau&s;e they &s;ay, <HI>They are poor.</HI> Nay, but our extreame&s;t <HI>Poverty</HI> &s;hould not hinder our <HI>Liberality,</HI> When God and His People are to be &s;erved with what we have: Whatever <HI>Simplicity</HI> the Wity and Crafty and Gripple Hold-fa&s;ts of the World, may imagine in it. We &s;hould not grumble at a|ny <HI>Expences</HI> which the Service of God and His People is to be maintained with; and tho' we have no more than <HI>Two Mites</HI> to give, we &s;hould part with more than <HI>One</HI> of them, rather than his Intere&s;t &s;hould meet
<PB N="12" REF="8"> with any prejudice.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we mu&s;t venture our <HI>Ho|nour</HI> for the People of God. It was an Act for which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is for ever <HI>Honourable,</HI> in Heb 11.24, 25. <HI>He Refu&s;ed to be called, The Son of</HI> Pharaohs Daughter, <HI>choo&s;ing rather to &s;uffer Affliction, with the People of God:</HI> Tho' we may ari&s;e to never &s;o much Grandeur, Dig|nity, and Preferment, by overlooking the Service of God and His People, we &s;hould think <HI>Little</HI> of the <HI>Grandeur,</HI> and rather trample upon &s;uch Dignity and Preferment. Tho' our Titles may be, <HI>Reverend,</HI> or <HI>Wor|&s;hipful,</HI> or <HI>Honourable,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Rightly</HI> &s;o too; neverthele&s;s we &s;hould think it no <HI>Hu|miliation</HI> to us, that the People of God mu&s;t be &s;erved by us. We are &s;woln with the <HI>vaine&s;t Air,</HI> if we count our &s;elves too Bigg to do what is be&s;poke for the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e that we &s;hould be <HI>Benefactors</HI> unto, if we would not unworthily pretend to be <HI>Superi|ours</HI> over them.</P>
<P>Moreover, we mu&s;t venture our <HI>Friends</HI> for the people of God.
