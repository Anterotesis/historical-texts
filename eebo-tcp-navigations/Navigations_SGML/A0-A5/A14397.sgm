<HEAD>&para; Newes from Vi|enna the .5. day of Augu&s;t .1566. of the Turkes ouerthrow:</HEAD>
<P>_AFter that the Emperour of Turkie had be&s;ieged with an army of thirty thou&s;and hor&s;me~ and footemen, the famous town and &s;tro~g Ca&s;tel of Iula in Hun+gary, lying .xl. dutch myles beyo~d the ryuer Danubius, which City had by the &s;pace of .vj. weekes &s;u&s;tayned many greuous a&s;&s;aultes: God through his great mercy and goodnes &s;o com+forted the &s;ayd towne of Iula and the poore Chri|&s;tians therein, at their earne&s;t praiers, that the Turke with all his ho&s;t was driuen backe, by the handes of the General called Keret&s;him La&s;lawe and hys valiant company. Who not onelye defen|ded the &s;ayd Towne, but al&s;o con&s;trayned the cru|ell Turkes to retyre, to their great &s;hame and con|fu&s;ion, w^t the &s;laughter of a great nomber of their Turki&s;h rable. For the which the euerliuyng God be pray&s;ed for euer. The manner of their ouer|throw was thys.</P>
<P>As the fore&s;ayd Generall Keret&s;him did &s;e his aduauntage, wyth Captayne George and other hor&s;men of Sche&s;ians and Hungary, he &s;et vpon the arereward of the Turkes, and kylled about .8. thou&s;and of them, and tooke al&s;o &s;ome of their ar|tillery,
<PB REF="3"> and followed them &s;o fa&s;t, that the Turkes were con&s;trayned to flee into a marri&s;h grounde, and to breake the wheeles of the re&s;t of their artil|lery, to &s;aue them &s;elues: which the Chri&s;tians al|&s;o tooke, and haue re&s;cued and taken be&s;ydes from the Turkes a great nomber of Chri&s;tia~ pri&s;oners, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rewyth a very rych bootye.</P>
<P>The like al&s;o hath done that valiant man Ma+got&s;rhie the Captayne of Erla, the which making toward the Turkes, did encounter with the Ter|tarians, &s;etting mo&s;t valiantly vpon them, and kil+led about eyght hundred of them.</P>
<P>A few dayes pa&s;t the Earle of Serin did en|counter with a Turki&s;h Capitayne called Begen, the which Capitaine then had with him a thou&s;a~d fre&s;h hor&s;men then comming out of Turkye, to go to a towne called Fynffekyrchen. Which Earle did &s;et vpon them in the night, and killed the Captain, and tooke .vjij. Camels, and .viii. Moyles laden wyth trea&s;ure, and got al&s;o twoo read Gwydons, wyth a whole great peece of rych cloth of gold, and al&s;o a very fayre and &s;traunge Iewel or token of the field. This fore&s;ayd Earle dyd &s;ende vnto the Emperours Maie&s;ty to Vienna for a pre&s;ent, the fore&s;ayd Captaynes hor&s;e, the which was not one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ry fayre one and good, but al&s;o betrapped &amp; decked mo&s;te rychly. For fyr&s;t the poniel &amp; the back part of the &s;addel was couered ouer with plate of fine Arabick gold, and the re&s;t of the &s;addel be&s;yde the &s;ytting place, was dre&s;t wyth &s;yluer plate very
<PB REF="3"> fyre gilded, which &s;itting place was couered with a fine purple veluet, and y^e trappers &amp; bridle be&s;et w^t litle Turkies and Rubies. The Earle would very fayne haue &s;aued the &s;ayd Capitayne, but the tur|ki&s;h Iany&s;&s;ery defended them &s;elues &s;o manfully, thinking to haue caryed away &s;afelye their Capi|taine, y^t the &s;aid Earle w^t hys company was con|&s;trayned to kyll both them and their Captayne.</P>
<P>Al&s;o this valiant Earle of Serin hath got a|monge&s;t other great prices from the Turkes .xv. thou&s;and Turki&s;h and Hu~gari&s;h Ducates, which money was brought for the payment of the Tur|ki&s;he men of warre, which are in the towne called Fynffkyrchen. Thus not onely this &s;aid Earle had got to him&s;elfe rich and great prices, but al&s;o hys Souldiours haue met with very rich prayes and &s;poyles.</P>
<P>And now to declare the Mahometical and tur|ki&s;h cruelty of the&s;e helli&s;h Turks, which they v&s;e agayn&s;t the Chri&s;tians (which cannot be declared without weeping and &s;orowfulnes of mynde) is this in effect. Where euer they ouercome the Chri|&s;tians and take them captiues, they take the yong and lu&s;ty men tying them to their hor&s;es &amp; fami&s;he them to death. The old men and women they cut in peeces, deflouring the maydens and young wo|men very villanou&s;ly. The &s;ely Infants and yong Babes lying in their cradels &s;myling vpon them, they take out very cruelly and &s;ticke them on long poles and &s;o gore them to death without pitye or
<PB REF="4"> mercy, and this very &s;pitefully they do in the &s;ight of the Infantes Parentes. The re&s;idue of them which they keepe alyue being men, they v&s;e as be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">+ites for all kynde of drudgery and toyle, more cru|elly entreating them then their brute bea&s;tes. To the women and children whych they keepe alyue, they v&s;e &s;uch Sodomi&s;h abhomination and tyran+ny as may not for &s;hame be knowen, nor wythout harty &s;orow be declared. Wherefore it behoueth al Chri&s;tian Princes and good Chri&s;tians to wyth|&s;tand thys cruel Turcki&s;h enemy, &amp; to &s;et to theyr helpyng handes, &s;uch as can to helpe to re&s;i&s;t hym with &s;ome power of warre: and &s;uche other good Chri&s;tians as cannot helpe the&s;e our Chri&s;tian bre+thre~ (&s;o cruelly a&s;&s;aulted) by this kinde of meanes: yet at lea&s;t to helpe them with their godly praiers. For if thus he proceede forwarde to take the vpper land, it wyl redound to the great plague and ruine of whole Chri&s;tendome. Wherefore that thus it may not come to pas, let vs not cea&s;e to cal vp|on our heauenly father for his mightye de|fence, who &s;o mercifully hath heard the praiers of his poore afflicted children. And al&s;o geue him hartye thankes for this great o|uer|throw of thys his Chri&s;tes and our cruell e|nemy.</P>
