<P>So it is, that there is notice giuen by the&s;e pre&s;ents that who&s;oeuer can reveale any one of them, or any of their complices, and a&s;&s;i&s;tantes which haue had a hand in this abominable con|&s;piracy, and cau&s;e them a liue to be deliuered to the Iu&s;tice, that he &s;hall be rewarded with the &s;um of 4000.

<P>We interdicte and prohibite likewi&s;e by the&s;e all manner of Per&s;ons to lodge any of the afore|mentioned (which hide them&s;elues) or their complices, and a&s;&s;i&s;tantes which are culpable of this damnable and dete&s;table Con&s;piracy, in their hou&s;es, or keepe, or &s;uffer them in their Gardens, Ships, Boates, Haye Reekes, Barnes, or permit them to goe away with their Wag|gons, Hor&s;es, Carts, Sleds, or any &s;uch like &s;er|uing to get away, either by Water, or by Land, vpon paine of life and goodes, and there &s;hall not any fauour be &s;hewed to any, although it were fir&s;t knowne many yeares after.</P>
<P>Furthermore &s;eeing it hath appeared mani|fe&s;tly by diuers informations, which the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners authori&s;ed and appointed thereunto haue receiued, that the <HI>Arminians,</HI> or the Societie of the Remon&s;trants (as they in&s;tile them) haue in the&s;e Landes, a formall Court, or Colledge, wherein they meete, being al&s;o prouided of diuers Commi&s;&s;ioners, or chiefe vndertakers and a Superintendent: likewi&s;e it is confe&s;&s;ed, that they haue diuers Commi&s;&s;ioners in euerie Towne, and Citie, to gather the moneys a|mong&s;t them of their owne Faction, of which they mu&s;t make accompt to their Court where the Superintendent &s;ittes with the other Commi&s;&s;io|ners. Moreouer that &s;ome of their &s;ocietie had written to &s;ome of their Preachers in the&s;e Landes, that they maruailed mightily that &s;ome
<PB N="4" REF="4">of them mayntained that their &s;ocietie might not right their cau&s;e by the way of violence: And they had therefore con&s;ulted vpon this point at their meeting, or Court, where they iudged that the &s;ayd way could not be tryed without indangering the Country to her vtter de&s;truction and ruine, neuerthele&s;&s;e con&s;idering that they could not mend them&s;elues (as they thought) in any other manner of wayes, and &s;u&s;pecting their Confraters, or Brothers to &s;mell of <HI>Anabapti&s;me,</HI> or <HI>Memnoni&s;me,</HI> (knowing that their opinion was hurtfull to their de&s;&s;ignes) they reiected them: Whereby, as likewi&s;e by that which is alreadie di&s;couered of the afore&s;ayd abomi|nable and mo&s;t dete&s;table Con&s;piracy, as al&s;o, by the Enterpri&s;es, and Machinations of the hidden Preachers, aboue mentioned, and diuers o|thers of their Societie, it appeareth euidently, that they haue v&s;ed all kind of &s;ini&s;ter practi&s;es and deui&s;es, to di&s;turbe againe not onely the Church and State, but likewi&s;e to cau&s;e in the&s;e Countries an ineuitable or vnauoydable bath of blood, and to de&s;troy the&s;e Prouinces afterwards by Incendiaries, or firers which &s;hould &s;et &s;euerall places on fire, whereupon (when the Countrey &s;hould haue beene in this confu&s;ion and perplex|itie) would our Enemie, haue a&s;&s;aulted vs, and inuaded the Country to make him&s;elfe Ma&s;ter of it, which he hath not beene able to doe (God be prai&s;ed within the &s;pace of the&s;e la&s;t 50. yeeres and more, although hee imployed to the &s;ayd
<PB N="5" REF="4">purpo&s;e great Armies, and charges, as it ap|peared likewi&s;e of late within the&s;e la&s;t two yeares.</P>
<P>Seeing al&s;o that a great while &s;ince it is perceiued, that diuers <HI>Arminian</HI> preachers which were here tofore bani&s;hed, and led out of the&s;e Vnited Prouinces, haue emboldened them&s;elues to returne hither againe (in &s;uch manner that there hath beene foure and twentie of them at once at <HI>Vtrecht</HI>) again&s;t the Proclamations of the High and Mighty Lords, the States Generall of the Vnited Prouinces, and goe di&s;gui&s;ed with &s;trange habits in the Vnited Prouinces, and prin|cipally in this Prouince of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> as well in the Citie, as the other Townes and Villages thereof, conuer&s;ing and walking there both day and night: Keeping al&s;o &s;ecret meetings, and con|uenticles, in which they make euen their Ser|mons, (which are prohibited by the State) and prouoke there, and in&s;tigate the good Inhabi|tants of the Vnited Prouinces, and e&s;pecially them of the Citie, the Townes, and the Lands of <HI>Vtrecht,</HI> to factions and commotions, and di&s;&s;en|tions: as likewi&s;e to the di&s;obedience of their Superiours and Magi&s;trates: In &s;uch manner, that (which is great pitty) there are found &s;ome of their faction and Society, that haue lo&s;t the one which they did beare in former time to the Almighty, their Countrey, and Countri-men, (before this <HI>Arminian</HI> Faction or Sect (rather) aro&s;e, liuing then Peaceably with their neigh|bours)
<PB N="6" REF="5">and haue forgotten them&s;elues &s;o farre, that they haue beene plotters and chiefe worke|ma&s;ters of this mo&s;t wicked and abominable Con|&s;piracy, and made it ready to the execution, which had happened a&s;&s;uredly, if the mercifull God had not &s;topt their proceedings, through his infinite wi&s;edome, and cau&s;ed it to be reuea|led in good time.</P>

<P>LOuing Friend: knowing that there are di&s;per|&s;ed among&s;t you &s;trange &s;peeches of the Pri&s;o|ners here lately taken, I would not forbeare to ad|ui&s;e you the truth of the matter.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> being two dayes agoe a|bout the afternoone, at <HI>Ry&s;wyck,</HI> there came three or foure Saylers which de&s;ired to &s;peake with his Excellency, and hauing gotten acce&s;&s;e to his per|&s;on, they related, that they were asked at <HI>Rotter|dam,</HI> whether they would be imployed in a &s;eruice for the good of the&s;e Countries, and were al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed great reward therefore.</P>
<P>They confe&s;&s;ed moreouer, that they had accep|ted the &s;aid &s;eruice, and had receiued certaine mo|ney thereupon, and that they were &s;ent afterwards to the <HI>Hage,</HI> where they deliuered two dayes agoe their fire-workes and other things, at a hou&s;e (vnto which they were directed) called the little foole in the Achterom, which is a &s;treet. And that they had &s;poken there with the party vnto whom they were directed to receiue further in&s;truction: but he had not told the~ at the &s;ame time, what they &s;hould doe, wi&s;hing them onely to goe on to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e with a good courage, and promi&s;ing that the next day the matter &s;hould be laid open vnto them.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P>They told moreouer, that they got of them at that in&s;tant certaine Duch Riders of 21. &s;hillings &s;terling a peece, which they &s;hewed al&s;o to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and &s;aid that their great liberali|ty made them to mi&s;tru&s;t the goodne&s;&s;e of this &s;er|uice, and cau&s;ed them to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome trea&s;on or Con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Prince commanded them to re|turne to the <HI>Hage,</HI> and to come towards euening to him at his Palace. Which they did, and infor|med his Excellency fully of all the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Whereupon he &s;ent pre&s;ently for the Pre&s;ident, and the Councell of State, who forthwith (after &s;ome deliberation) &s;ent the Atturney or Fi&s;call of the Court, with the Prouo&s;t Mar&s;hall, to the hou&s;e or Inne afore&s;aid, where they found the per&s;ons by them de&s;cribed, and the man which paid them the money afore&s;aid, whom they carried in&s;tantly to the Court, and examined them.</P>
<P>The Towne&s;men and the Souldiers within were pre&s;ently commanded to keepe &s;trong watches euery where, and to &s;top all pa&s;&s;ages that no body &s;hould come away without leaue. But it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to preuent it, &s;eeing there are no walls about the <HI>Hage.</HI> They &s;earched al&s;o after|wards the Helmet (an Inne) about the Waggons which goe to <HI>Harlem,</HI> and when they asked for the man with his Trunks, the owner thereof went &s;pee|dily vp into a chamber where it &s;tood, and opening it, he tooke &s;ome things thereour, and leauing it open, came downe in great ha&s;te, and got out of the hou&s;e, &s;eeing that there was a Serjeant which
<PB N="11" REF="7">told to the re&s;t, that he was an hone&s;t man, and that he had knowne him many yeares agoe.</P>
<P>When the Fi&s;call asked the Ho&s;te whether there was not a man with a trunke in his hou&s;e: he an&s;wered, no: But &s;eeing they found afterwards the trunke, (open with diuers pi&s;tols and other things, as it was left by the owner) when they &s;ear|ched the hou&s;e, the Ho&s;te was taken pri&s;oner, though the owner, the former Secretary of <HI>Bley&s;|wicke</HI> had made an e&s;cape, as is afore&s;aid, the o|ther were examined the &s;ame night, and he which payed the money to the Mariners confe&s;&s;ed that there was one dwelling at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> which had &s;et him on work, and hauing told his name and de|&s;cribed his per&s;on, there went, about foure of the clocke in the morning, two Councellors of State with diuers others to find him out, but he was de|parted thence, &amp; it is thought that the late Secreta|ry of <HI>Bley&s;wick</HI> who was e&s;caped had giuen him notice of the di&s;couering of their con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>The examinations of the pri&s;oners haue la&s;ted ye&s;terday, and this night and day, but their confe&s;|&s;ions are kept as yet very &s;ecret: there are found in the meane time many pi&s;tols, &s;words and daggers in the truncke afore&s;aid, and in the other Inne, and I haue &s;eene &s;ome of them at the Court.</P>
<P>To day had the Preachers order to giue God thankes in their prayers for the di&s;couering of this abhominable con&s;piracy of the enemies of the State.</P>
<P>The Mariners which haue reuealed this Trea|&s;on, are glad that they haue cleared their con&s;ci|ence,
<PB N="12" REF="8">and ca&s;t this burthen off their necks, making good cheare at the Ca&s;telayn of the Court his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I heare at this in&s;tant that there is now to bee made another &s;earch: of the &s;ucce&s;&s;e I will adui&s;e you with the next, if God giue me leaue.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION, OR The Light of February: Wherein is to be &s;eene, <HI>The &s;trange and abominable Con&s;piracy which was intended again&s;t the vnited Prouinces, and the Inhabitants therein: Reuealed by the&s;e foure ho|ne&s;t men:</HI> Iohn Engelen, Iohn Faes, Ieroen Ewout&s;zon, Pieter Ian&s;sen Broeck.</HEAD>
<P>_IT &s;eemeth that the Almigh|ty hath beene plea&s;ed many times to defend or pre&s;erue his Church not onely by meanes of the &s;imple, but euen al&s;o by the actions of her owne enemies, as you may perceiue by this pre|&s;ent Relation. And it is very well knowne to the Inhabitants of this Coun|try, what kind of fellowes our Mariners are for the mo&s;t part, and principally the&s;e 4, which di&s;coue|red the trea&s;on, here before mentioned, to be very &s;tout and re&s;olute, and &s;tained moreouer with the Arminian doctrine, as all the re&s;t of the con&s;pira|cy, but I will not &s;ay that they are all &s;tained which haue conuer&s;ed with them, with &s;uch a foule &s;pot, as &s;hall appeare by the&s;e and other good Patriots or well-willers of their Country.</P>
<P>But to come to the matter: It is to be ob&s;erued
<PB N="14" REF="9">that the elde&s;t of the&s;e foure Mariners was called (by a nicke name) <HI>Light,</HI> among&s;t the common people, which &s;eemed to pre&s;age &s;ome thing, if the Progno&s;tication had beene made before the effect appeared: but to leaue all friuolous things behind, and to relate &s;hortly that which is pa&s;t in the&s;e parts of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> concerning the con|&s;piracy aforementioned.</P>
<P>The 4. of February, in the yeere 1623. came to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> a &s;trange Mon&s;ter, in the &s;hape of the former Secretary of <HI>Bley&s;wyck,</HI> hauing his belly fil|led with ranke poyfon, as &s;hall be publi&s;hed after|ward by authority of the State to all the world: This wicked fellow who (as he thought) could al|ter his mouth &amp; face into &s;uch countenance as he plea&s;ed, and change his voice as he li&s;ted, was ac|quainted with one of the Mariners afore&s;aid, but the Mariner could not feele pre&s;ently with his woollen gloues what he carried vnder his cloak, as he did afterwards (by the grace of God) when his hands were naked. He told in the beginning to the Mariner, that it was a braue enterpri&s;e, &amp; tending to the good of the Common-wealth, but (as hee &s;aid) it mu&s;t be kept &s;ecret, and the reward would a&s;&s;wage or &s;weeten the labour and pains, and de&s;i|red him therefore to find out three other lu&s;ty and re&s;olute Saylers as he was him&s;elfe, which he did at an in&s;tant, (&s;eeing they know one another, and can certifie whom they dare tru&s;t with their liues, and will &s;tand for a man when occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erue) and brought them to him; where after &s;ome &s;pee|ches betwixt them, the foure Mariners yeelded to
<PB N="15" REF="9">their employment in the &s;ayd &s;eruice. About the &s;ame time there came another (whom they neuer &s;aw before) which after &s;ome conference gaue them 300. Gilders (which amount to 30. Pound &s;terling) a piece aforehand, onely vpon hope of good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, which plea&s;ed the Mariners excee|ding well, and made them grow hot to the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e: Hee added moreouer that after the enter|pri&s;e was performed they &s;hould want neither goods nor money, and &s;hould each one of them be&s;ides be honoured with an office. After the&s;e faire promi&s;es made vnto the Mariners, the other two told them where they &s;hould receiue diuers Pi&s;tols, be&s;ides gunpowder, and Lead, or Bullets, with great &s;tore of Stillettos or murdering Dag|gers, and other &s;uch like things to pierce a harne&s;&s;e of proofe withall, and de&s;ired them to bring them in &s;euerall trunkes to a certaine Inne at the <HI>Hage,</HI> which they performed with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and diligence, for they packt the&s;e things &s;ecretly vp in trunkes, and cau&s;ed them in their company the 5. of February to bee carried from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to <HI>Delft,</HI> and thence towards the <HI>Hage,</HI> where they brought them to the appointed Inne called the Helmet, and found there at the &s;ame in&s;tant their Ma&s;ter (which &s;et them on work at the beginning) who bade them welcome, and made them good cheare.</P>
<P>In the meane time had he (who payed them the money) hired likewi&s;e foure other couragious and lu&s;ty Mariners, and had &s;ent them with the like in|&s;truments and commodities put in trunkes as the
<PB N="16" REF="10">other, through the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age towards the <HI>Hage,</HI> &amp; charged the~ to meet at an Inne called the little Foole, (which they did) and were there well recei|ued and entertained with drinke and meat.</P>
<P>The &s;ixt of this Moneth (O happy day) beganne the Mariners afore&s;aid to &s;u&s;pect the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, (without que&s;tion through the in&s;piration of the Almighty) and to confer one with another about it, and concluded among&s;t them&s;elues, that they would not enter any further into the &s;aid bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, beleeuing it to be a foule peece of worke: And re&s;olued thereupon that two of them &s;hould goe in&s;tantly to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to certifie his Excellency of the ca&s;e, and to learne whether they were employed in the &s;eruice of the Country or not. Comming with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the Court in the <HI>Hage,</HI> they vnder&s;tood that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was gone to <HI>Ry&s;wyck,</HI> (where &s;ome of his Hor&s;e are kept) they went thither pre&s;ently with their tarred apparell, &amp; &s;heaths of horne for their kniues, and other things, as the Saylers v&s;e to weare in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and talking among&s;t them&s;elues along the way, the time &s;eemed very &s;hort vnto them at their arriuall: And among&s;t the re&s;t, they conferred together in what manner, and with what countenance they &s;hould &s;peake to the Prince his Excellency.</P>
<P>When they were at the Stable of the Prince, they &s;aw there diuers Lacquies and Yeomen of the Prince his Guard, and told them that they would faine &s;peake a word or two with his Excellency; but no body &s;eemed to giue greatly eare vnto
<PB N="17" REF="10">them, neuerthele&s;&s;e there was one of the Lacquies, who laughing, accepted to tell the Prince of them and their de&s;ire, &s;u&s;pecting that they had &s;ome &s;trange toy or thing to &s;hew to his Excellency; who &s;ent them word backe againe by the Lacquy, that he would heare them as &s;oone as he came out of his &s;table: whereupon they an&s;wered, that they would &s;peak with his Excellency about a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e that concerned mightily his own per&s;on, and that there was perhaps danger in delay, (as the Ciuill Lawyers &s;ay) <HI>Periculum in mora:</HI> The Prince (who hath loued continually the Mariners) vnder&s;tan|ding this, cau&s;ed them in&s;tantly to come to him, where they made the be&s;t reuerence they could af|ter their owne manner, and reuealed all the mat|ter vnto him. Now you may gue&s;&s;e what the Prince thought of it, hearing of an enterpri&s;e of which he knew not him&s;elfe: he commanded the Mariners to returne to the Court, by the way of <HI>Vorburg,</HI> which is a village about the <HI>Hage,</HI> and rode him&s;elfe with all &s;peed to the Court, where he communicated in&s;tantly this matter with the States. Hereupon was pre&s;ently giuen order that the two Innes here before mentioned, &s;hould be &s;earched in&s;tantly, and that all them which were within the two Innes &s;hould be cea&s;ed vpon, vntill &s;uch time as the heads and complices of this wic|ked onterpri&s;e &s;hould be found out. They got the money ma&s;ter or Pur&s;er, (who payed the Mari|ners) at the Inne called the little Foole, the re&s;t which were in the hou&s;e are likewi&s;e apprehended, and I cannot heare as yet that any one of them is
<PB N="18" REF="11">&s;et at liberty. At the other Inne (where the Secre|tary of <HI>Bley&s;wick</HI> e&s;caped) were euen al&s;o diuers apprehended, but they are all di&s;mi&s;t, &s;eeing they were found innocent and cleare of this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. All the in&s;truments afore&s;aid which were found in the two Innes, were likewi&s;e carried away by the Officers of the Court.</P>
<P>Concerning the Mariners, they were 9. dayes kept in the hou&s;e of the Keeper or Ca&s;telain of the Court, vntil the States knew by examination that they were not guilty, and had behaued them&s;elues as true Patriots and well-willers of the Country ought to doe, and di&s;charged their con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>This night and the next day commanded the States &s;trong watches to be kept, as well of the Town&s;men, as of the Souldiers about the <HI>Hage,</HI> and the pa&s;&s;ages to goe thence: And they cau&s;ed likewi&s;e a Proclamation to be publi&s;hed and prin|ted as we haue heard before.</P>
<P>The next day being Wedne&s;day, vpon the 8. of this Moneth, was the fa&s;ting and prayer day kept, whereof the States had warned the Country fourteen dayes before. This alteration &s;eemed to cau&s;e a new zeale among&s;t the inhabitants, that all the Churches were packt vp &s;o full, as the like was not &s;eene by any man liuing.</P>
<P>About the euening came the Hangman into the <HI>Hage,</HI> to put &s;ome of the apprehended to the tor|ture. The &s;ame day were likewi&s;e three of <HI>Barne|velts</HI> &s;eruants taken pri&s;oners, and the hou&s;e of the widow of <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Oldenbarnevelt</HI> as likewi&s;e that of <HI>Renier</HI> of <HI>Oldenbarnevelt</HI> his &s;onne guarded by
<PB N="19" REF="11">certaine officers of the Court.</P>
<P>The 9. day of this Moneth were yet &s;ome at the <HI>Hage</HI> apprehended, and there came newes that two were taken at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and that &s;ome were fled thence, whereupon the Country was much per|plexed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day there came al&s;o tidings from <HI>Harlem,</HI> that there was made a great hole in the walls of the pri&s;on by &s;ome which were without, with a great augre, iu&s;t vpon the roome in which two Arminian Preachers were put about three weekes agoe, becau&s;e they were come into the Dominion of the States, out of which they were bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>The 10. and 11. day of this Moneth, were in all the Cities and Townes of the Vnited Prouinces the Proclamations of the States concerning this Con&s;piracy publi&s;hed, &amp; euery where great paines were taken to apprehend the Authors and Com|plices thereof. In tho&s;e dayes was the Lord <HI>van|der Mylen</HI> &s;ent for to come into the <HI>Hage,</HI> where he came freely, and is lodged now at the hou&s;e of the Keeper of the Court, whereby it &s;eemeth that hee is not &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The 12. day of this Moneth when it was night, there were two poore Boers which &s;aw <HI>Adriaen Adriaen&s;&s;on van Dyck,</HI> the former Secretary of <HI>Bley&s;wyck,</HI> wherevpon they went purpo&s;ely to the Mayor of the place, who tooke him afterwards: whereupon the Boers got within few dayes the moneyes promi&s;ed by the Proclamation of the States, for the di&s;couering of him, namely 4000.
<PB N="20" REF="12">Gilders, which amount to 400. pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>The 14. of this Moneth, the fore-mentioned <HI>A|driaen Adriaen&s;&s;on van Dyck</HI> &s;ent for &s;ome of his Children and Kindred (a little before the Officers came to him out of the <HI>Hage</HI>) and confe&s;&s;ed vnto them that he had de&s;erued death, and cur&s;ed migh|tily the Arminian Preachers which &s;educed him, hee was yet the &s;ame day brought to the pri&s;on of the <HI>Hage</HI> by the Officers which came for him from the Court.</P>
<P>This day were the Sailers (which had vntill that time made good cheare at the hou&s;e of the keeper of the Court) &s;et at liberty, and each one of them was honoured of his Excellency with a peece of gold whereon was the Picture and Armes of the Prince with his Deuice, worth about 80. Gilders, which amount to 8. pounds &s;terling, as likewi&s;e with a &s;iluerd Sword for each of them. The States moreouer cau&s;ed to each of them to be giuen 600. Gilders which amount to 60. pounds &s;terling, be|&s;ides a monethly pen&s;ion of 16. Gilders, or 32. &s;hil|lings &s;terling, during their liues: granting them moreouer their Letters of recommendation to the Court of Admiralty, for the fir&s;t offices (of which they be capable) that &s;hall fall. Whereupon they returned with great contentment to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and told their friends their fortune, and cloathed them|&s;elues there in gray &s;utes of cloath, and bought there for their own wearing gray hats, with golden bands, as if they had bin Sea-Captains already.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day were the bels of the Town hou&s;e of the <HI>Hage</HI> rung, whereupon the two &s;onnes of
<PB N="21" REF="12"><HI>Barnevelt</HI> were warned to appeare within the &s;pace of 14. daies; and to an&s;wer for them&s;elues vpon paine of their bani&s;hment, &amp; confi&s;cation of their goods, according to the Lawes and cu&s;tome of the Country.</P>
<P>The 15. day foure Citizens were apprehended at <HI>Leyden</HI> about this Con&s;piracy, and it was per|ceiued that &s;ome of their con&s;orts were fled.</P>
<P>The 16. of this Moneth was at the <HI>Hage</HI> a ru|mour that both the &s;onnes of <HI>Barneuelt</HI> were &s;eene at <HI>Scheuelingen</HI> about the Sea-coa&s;t, with a skipper of their acquaintance who dwelt there, wherupon his Wife was apprehended in the ab&s;ence of her husband and carryed to the <HI>Hage,</HI> where &s;he con|fe&s;&s;ed vpon examination that her husband depar|ted the night before from his hou&s;e with them: &amp; &s;earch being made, it was found out pre&s;ently that they went from <HI>Scheuelingen</HI> to <HI>Berckerhey, Cat|wyck, Noortwyck, Santvoort, Wyck op Zee,</HI> along a ditch towards the Sea, which is called the <HI>Honds|bo&s;h,</HI> and came thence into the I&s;land of <HI>Texel.</HI></P>
<P>The 17. day of this Moneth was the town-hou&s;e of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> fired very earely in the morning, at which time the Cutler afore mentioned got away among the people which came to quench the fire, he was taken, becau&s;e hee had &s;old diuers In&s;tru|ments and armes to the Con&s;pirators. The other, namely the Tinker was di&s;mi&s;t by the Lords, &s;eeing there was at that time yet nothing found out wher|with they could charge him.</P>
<P>The Cutler went to diuers of his acquaintance, but no man would receiue him, and &s;eeing hee is
<PB N="22" REF="13">&s;till ab&s;ent there is promi&s;ed a &s;umme of mone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to them that &s;hall cau&s;e him to be apprehended.</P>
<P>The 18. of this Moneth was the elde&s;t &s;onne of <HI>Barnevelt</HI> taken in the I&s;land of <HI>Texel,</HI> with the skipper afore&s;aid, and one of his men.</P>
<P>The 19. being the next day, he was brought to the <HI>Hage</HI> and put in pri&s;on, where he was examined &s;ince, but we cannot heare as yet any thing of his confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The 20. of this Moneth were all the pri&s;oners which were taken about this Con&s;piracy exami|ned by the Iu&s;tices of the Court.</P>
<P>The 21. were at <HI>Ouwer&s;chic,</HI> a village, yet two o|ther taken of this Con&s;piracy, namely <HI>Dauid Co|renwinder</HI> Secretary in former time of <HI>Berckel,</HI> and the Boer which lodged him. They were carried likewi&s;e the &s;ame day to the pri&s;on which is in the <HI>Hage,</HI> where there are (ma&s;ters and &s;eruants) at lea&s;t twenty, apprehended for this Con&s;piracy.</P>
