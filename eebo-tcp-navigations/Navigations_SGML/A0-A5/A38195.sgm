<P N="1">I. <HI>Propo&s;ition. <HI>THE Fund to be made up</HI></HI> 1500000 l. <HI>at least, and not to exceed Two Millions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The Company do humbly averr, and are ready to Prove, to the King's Mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty's Satisfaction, That their pre|&s;ent quick and <HI>dead Stock and Revenue</HI> is of more Real Value than the &s;aid Sum of 1100000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Prop. <HI>The Stock of the pre&s;ent Company to be part of this Fund, and to be rated at</HI></HI> 744000 l. <HI>if they can give Security, that it &s;hall Effectually produce that Sum; or el&s;e at &s;o much le&s;s as they will engage to make good after all Debts paid, and Satisfaction made to the</HI> Mogull <HI>and his Subjects; against who&s;e Preten&s;ions the New Stock to be indemnified by the like Security.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Company recommending <HI>their Righteous Cau&s;e to GOD,</HI> and His Maje&s;ties known and famous Ju&s;tice in the whole cour&s;e of his happy Life, &s;ay, That <HI>The Value of every Thing is
<PB N="6" REF="5">what it will Sell for;</HI> and their Stock, under all the Calumnies and Per&s;ecutions of their Adver&s;aries, now currently Sells for 150 l. per <HI>Hundred:</HI> and they know and can prove it to be intrin&s;ecally more worth than that currant Price: But <HI>they know no Law or Rea|&s;on,</HI> why they &s;hould be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their E&s;tates, at any le&s;s Value than they are really worth in ready Money, by all the Mea|&s;ures any thing is valued in any part of the World.</P>
<P>They humbly &s;ay, as to Security, <HI>They know no Rea&s;on</HI> why they &s;hould give Security for their own E&s;tates.</P>
<P>They affirm, That they owe not a Penny to <HI>the Great</HI> Mogull, <HI>or any of his Subjects,</HI> other than their running Accounts with their own <HI>Banyans</HI> and Brokers, which are changing daily, like Merchants running Ca&s;h in a Gold&s;mith's hand.</P>
<P>Although the Company owe nothing to the <HI>Mogull,</HI> as afore|&s;aid, yet the bare mentioning any &s;uch thing by a Publick Act of His Maje&s;ty, would be enough to per&s;wade Him to invent Demands upon the Company, for Tran&s;actions and Pretences, done in Ages pa&s;t, before any of the pre&s;ent Adventurers were born; and there|fore that part of the Propo&s;ition &s;eems <HI>Manife&s;tly Impo&s;&s;ible as well as &V;nju&s;t,</HI> neither the <HI>Mogull</HI> nor any of his Subjects having made any Complaint to His Maje&s;ty, of the Companies being in Debt to him or them: That being only a Sugge&s;tion of the Interlopers and their Adherents, not only now, but for many years pa&s;t.</P>

<P N="3">III. <HI>Prop. <HI>That the &s;aid Stock of the pre&s;ent Company &s;hall be brought home at any time within <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span">years in the Ships abroad, or tho&s;e to be &s;ent on account of the New Stock, paying the &s;ame Freight, and di&s;po&s;ed of at Publick Sales by the Members of the pre|&s;ent Company, and the Nett-proceed thereof to be taken as part of the</HI></HI> 744000 l. <HI>as &s;hall al&s;o the Value of their Forts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to be Estimated by indifferent per&s;ons, and put into the hands of the New-Charter Company: But after <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span"> days, no Goods to be Exported to the</HI> Ea&s;t Indies <HI>on Account of the Old Stock.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Company &s;ay they have as real a Right to all their Forts, Cities, Towns, and Territories in <HI>India,</HI> to them and their Succe&s;&s;ors for ever; as they have to their purcha&s;ed Lands and Ware-hou&s;es in <HI>England</HI> belonging to the Companies Joint-Stock, or other Private Lands or Manors belonging to the particular Ad|venturers: <HI>Rex Dei Gratia</HI> being Originally the Title by which
<PB N="7" REF="5">very many Manors and Lands, Court-Leets and Court-Barons are held in <HI>England.</HI> And as the Company are not willing to be di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;aid Real E&s;tate, until they are paid for them; which they believe in their Con&s;ciences, hath Co&s;t them at &s;everal times above a Million in ready Mony Sterling, be&s;ides the Intere&s;t. But for the Price that &s;hould be paid them for their &s;aid Real E&s;tates, if it were come to that &s;ingle point, they would refer them&s;elves to, and rely upon His Maje&s;ties Ju&s;tice, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Prop. <HI>That what-ever the quick and dead Stock &s;hall thus produce more than</HI></HI> 744000 l. <HI>&s;hall be divided wholly between the Mem|bers of the pre&s;ent Company, proportionably to their re&s;pective Stocks.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Prop. <HI>Books to be provided for new Sub&s;criptions, within and then the Books to be clo&s;ed.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Prop. <HI>If the Sub&s;criptions exceed Two Millions, each Sub|&s;criber to be Reduced proportionably, till the whole make but Two Millions.</HI></HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Prop. <HI>That every Sub&s;criber pay in his Money, upon pain</HI></HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>To the IV, V, VI, and VII. <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> the Company humbly An&s;wer, That they do as little under&s;tand the New Sub&s;cribers, as they &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t of tho&s;e Sub&s;cribers know the Affairs of <HI>India:</HI> But the Company know the late new way of Sub&s;cribing, without Authority from His Maje&s;ty, is an old Practice of Interlopers and others, emulous of the Companies Pro&s;perity; and hath formerly been debated upon the like voluntary Sub&s;criptions &s;everal times, and many years &s;ince in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; when &s;ome of the Lords of His now Maje&s;ties mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council were pre&s;ent: But it always ended, in only giving Unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble to His Maje&s;ty and the Company.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Prop. <HI>No One Per&s;on to have above</HI></HI> 10000 l. <HI>in this Stock, in his own or others Name, in trust for him, and every Sub|&s;criber &s;hall make Oath accordingly; and that it is his Own Money.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> in Duty to His Maje&s;ty, and in Love to our Native Country, the Company mu&s;t freely declare again&s;t, as <HI>being notoriou&s;ly prejudicial to the Nation,</HI> who-ever the Ad|venturers are: Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e Trade is a Free Agent, and mu&s;t not be Limited or Bounded; if it be &s;o in any Nation, it will never pro&s;per. Secondly, It is again&s;t the Laws and Cu&s;toms of <HI>England,</HI> and all Nations upon the face of the Earth, That any Man that buys a Commodity, and pays hone&s;tly for it in Ready Money, &s;hould be compelled to Swear it is his Own Money, or who&s;e it is; <HI>this being only a Trick of the fir&s;t Propo&s;ers,</HI> to &s;erve their particular turn, <HI>without any National or other Regard to Right or
<PB N="8" REF="6">Publick Good.</HI> Thirdly, If &s;uch a Limitation were Advi&s;able, certainly &s;ome Nation or other would have hit upon the Expe|dient before this time: Whereas, on the contrary, the <HI>wi&s;e Dutch</HI> indulge and favour the very <HI>Jews,</HI> and the more for Buying the greater Stock; of whom, one Man, by name <HI>Swa&s;&s;o,</HI> had at one time about 75000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock: The <HI>French</HI> King likewi&s;e, for the Encouragement of Large Sub&s;criptions in that Stock, propounded many Con&s;iderable Priviledges and Immunities, both to Natives and Foreiners, proportionable to the Greatne&s;s of their &s;aid Sub&s;criptions: The <HI>Danes</HI> likewi&s;e (it is &s;aid) made a Law not long &s;ince, That &s;uch as would not Add a certain Proportion to their Stock already Wrote, &s;hould Forfeit their Stock; which was a Con&s;traint on the other hand, and as erroneous as that in the afore&s;aid <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI> Fourthly, Such kind of Levelling or Li|miting Per&s;onal E&s;tates, was never known in Commonwealths, much le&s;s in Monarchies. Our <HI>Levellers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and anti|ently the <HI>Tribunes</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> never pretended to the Limitation of Per&s;onal E&s;tates, but of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Land; and not of all Lands, (not in their Provinces;) but only the Lands of <HI>Italy,</HI> which was the Seat or Country of the Commonwealth. Fifthly, No con&s;iderable Man of Fortune or Experience will ever endure the fatigue of continual Study in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Companies arduous Affairs, but he will find his Account &s;ome way; and that mu&s;t be either by a Great Reward, or by a Great Stock; or by other and wor&s;e ways of paying him&s;elf. The mo&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Companies give a <HI>Committe-Man</HI> is about 50 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> whereas we have heard the <HI>Dutch</HI> allow Mr. <HI>Peter Van Dam</HI> about 800 <HI>l.</HI> and about 400 <HI>l.</HI> a Year to his Son: But &s;uch an able active Man's having a great Stock of his own, is better for the Publick Society than any Re|ward can be allowed him: Becau&s;e &s;uch a Man that is Obliged by Reward only, &s;o to Attend the Companies Bu&s;ine&s;s, is tied only by one Cord; but he that expects all Satisfaction to ari&s;e from the Profit of his own Stock, is tied with the two great Cords, which do almo&s;t the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Reward, by the Profit of his own Great Stock, and Fear of Great Lo&s;s, if his own Stock &s;hould mi&s;carry by Ill Conduct.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Prop. <HI>That every Member of the pre&s;ent Company who hath above</HI></HI> 10000 l. <HI>Stock, &s;hall Sell forthwith the Over-plus at the rate of</HI> 100 l. <HI>for</HI> 100 l. <HI>but &s;o that if the whole Nett-proceed of the pre&s;ent Stock exceeds</HI> 744000 l. <HI>this over-plus &s;hall go to the Per&s;on that hath Sold his over-plus Stock, proportionably to the Stock he had before &s;uch Sale.</HI></P>
