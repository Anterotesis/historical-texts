<HEAD>SUFFOLK</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. _ON the South of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> hath <HI>Cambridge</HI> on the We&s;t, di|vided from <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Southward by the River <HI>Stow,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> Ocean beating on the Ea&s;t; two Rivers, <HI>little Ou&s;e</HI> and <HI>VVaveny,</HI> running &s;everall wayes from the &s;ame Springs between <HI>Norfolk</HI> and it.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Region large, harborous, of a rich &s;oil except Ea&s;tward, fruitfull corne-fields, and good pa&s;tures, and meadows for fatting cattel, abound|ing in chee&s;e, and not without woods, and many Parks for Deer adjoyning to Noble Hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. The politick or civil Di&s;tribution of this <HI>County</HI> is into 3 Parts, The <HI>Geldable,</HI> St. <HI>Edmunds</HI> Liberty, and St. <HI>Etheldreds.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="4">3. Near <HI>Cambridg-&s;hire</HI> is &s;eated <HI>Ixning,</HI> of le&s;&s;er fame now then heretofore, by rea&s;on of the vicinity of <HI>New-market,</HI> whither the Trade is carried. <HI>New-market Heath</HI> is a large and &s;pa|cious Plain, barren and &s;andy, but green; here men admire at <HI>Devils dike,</HI> as if the Devil had made it, whereas no doubt it was but a Trench made of old by the Inhabitants of this Country, again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of their Enemies.</P>
<P N="5">5. Onward is St. <HI>Edmunds Bury,</HI> a famous Town, &s;o called from <HI>Edmund,</HI> a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, who&s;e body, after he was cruelly &s;lain by the <HI>Danes,</HI> was here interred. It flouri&s;hed much, which K. <HI>Canute</HI> had repaired, and new built the Church, offered his Crown to the holy Martyr, brought in <HI>Monks</HI> with their <HI>Abbot,</HI> and be&s;towed many Lands upon them, and among the re&s;t, the Town it &s;elf. Of the Town and Mo|na&s;tery, while it &s;tood, hear <HI>Lelands</HI> Te&s;timony, an Eye-witne&s;s, <HI>Sol non vidit urbem &s;itu elegantiorem, &s;ic molli delicata pendet in clivo, &amp; ridulus ad Ori|entem defluit; aut Coenobium illu&s;trius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6. Near unto <HI>Bury</HI> appears <HI>Ru&s;hbrook,</HI> the Seat of the noble Family of the <HI>Iermins:</HI> and not far off <HI>Ikesworth,</HI> and more on the North <HI>Fernham;</HI> and near it <HI>Lidgate,</HI> a Village not to be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence, being ennobled by the birth of <HI>Iohn Lidgate</HI> Monk, who&s;e wit the Mu&s;es them&s;elves framed and adorned, his <HI>Engli&s;h Poems</HI> are of &s;uch grace and elegancy. Thus of the We&s;tern part,</P>
<P N="8">8. On the South, <HI>Stour,</HI> nigh the Fountain,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
overflows, and makes <HI>Stour-mere,</HI> and then collecting his waters within banks, vi&s;its <HI>Clare,</HI> a noted Town, which &s;hews you the ruines of an old Ca&s;tle. Thence by <HI>long Melford</HI> rejoycing to &s;ee the fair Ho&s;pitall built there by Sr. <HI>VVilliam Cordall,</HI> he pa&s;&s;eth on to <HI>Sudbury</HI> (Southbury) once the chief Town of this Shire, and yet will not ea&s;ily yield priority to any other: for it is populous, and a rich clothing Town, governed by a Major yearly cho&s;en out of &s;even Aldermen.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Edward&s;ton</HI> is not far off, a Town of &s;mall note now, and after a few miles <HI>Stour</HI> is en|crea&s;ed by the acce&s;s of the little river <HI>Breton,</HI> which, in no long cour&s;e, wa&s;hes two Towns of ancient Names; near the &s;prings, <HI>Bretenham,</HI> now a little one, and having no face of a City; and &s;omewhat Ea&s;tward, <HI>Ofton, i. e.</HI> the Town of <HI>Offa</HI> K. of <HI>Mercians;</HI> beneath which is <HI>Hadley,</HI> a Town of good note for clothing.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Stour</HI> having received <HI>Breton</HI> runs down with it, not far from <HI>Bentley,</HI> and after a few miles near <HI>Arwenton,</HI> the Seat of the illu&s;trious Family of the <HI>Parkers,</HI> drowns him&s;elf in the Ocean, meeting with the river <HI>Orwell</HI> or <HI>Gipping.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Orwell</HI> floweth even out of the belly of this Country, from two Fountains, the one near <HI>VVulpet,</HI> a Market Town <HI>(Luporum fo&s;&s;a)</HI> the other at <HI>Gipping</HI> a poor Village. At <HI>Norton,</HI> by it, K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. &s;ought for Golden Mines in vain, and the pits &s;peak as much.</P>
<P N="11">11. Along the &s;ame River are &s;een <HI>Stow,</HI> and <HI>Needham,</HI> two Market Towns, and <HI>Himingston</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
almo&s;t on the bank of it, where <HI>Baldwin le Pet|ture</HI> held Lands by a &s;trange merry Tenure, <HI>per &s;altum, &s;ufflum, &amp; pettum.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Nearer the mouth of it appears <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> (of old <HI>Gippewich,</HI>) of an humble &s;ite, the eye, as it were, of this County, a commodious Haven, a great Market-Town of trade, a great multitude of Inhabitants, beautified with Fourteen Churches, and many fair and magnificent Buildings. The Corporation con&s;i&s;ts of Twelve Burge&s;&s;es (called <HI>Portmen</HI>) of which the chief are two <HI>Bailieffs</HI> cho&s;en yearly, and as many Iu&s;tices out of Twenty-four others. Thus for the Southern part.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Ea&s;tern Coa&s;ts upon the Sea, run|ning toward the North. The River <HI>Deben</HI> ri&s;eth near <HI>Mendle&s;ham</HI> a market Town, thence vi&s;iteth and gives name to <HI>Debenham,</HI> from the deep waies round about it: afterwards it runns by <HI>Vfford</HI> and <HI>Rendole&s;ham</HI> on the other &s;ide, and &s;o to <HI>VVoodbridge,</HI> delighted with the neatne&s;s of the Town; and then after a few miles is enter|tained by the Ocean, at <HI>Bad&s;way</HI> Haven.</P>
<P N="14">14. Now the Shore advanceth a little Ea&s;t|ward, at the mouth of the river <HI>Orns,</HI> which hath its ri&s;e near <HI>Framlingham</HI> Ca&s;tle, and pre|&s;ently &s;preads it &s;elf as it were into a Lake, on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">he We&s;t &s;ide thereof. This is a very fair Ca&s;tle, and well fortified, with thirteen Turrets in a great thick wall, and within are many conve|nient hand&s;ome Lodgings. <HI>Orns</HI> having wa&s;hed a little Town <HI>Parham,</HI> and then <HI>Glemham,</HI> gives
<PB N="5" REF="5">
name to <HI>Oreford,</HI> and near it falls into the Sea,</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Oreford</HI> was a large and populous Town, but now complains of the ungratefull Ocean, for withdrawing him&s;elf, and envying her the commodity of her Haven by little and little. In the time of King <HI>Henry,</HI> there is a &s;tory, how the Fi&s;hermen here caught in their nets a wilde creature, repre&s;enting in all parts the &s;hape of a man, with a long beard, and much rough hair on his brea&s;t; who, at la&s;t &s;ecretly e&s;caped to the Sea, and was &s;een no more.</P>
<P N="16">16. Not much higher, in a &s;afe and plea&s;ant Site, lies <HI>Alburg,</HI> between the Vally <HI>Slangden,</HI> where the Sea beats on the Ea&s;t, and the River on the We&s;t; a Station for Mariners and Fi&s;her|men not incommodious, nor unfrequented: Hard by, when the Harve&s;t was &s;poiled all <HI>England</HI> over by un&s;ea&s;onable weather, in the Year 1555. Peale grew up miraculou&s;ly, with|out any earth, among&s;t the &s;tones, in the beginning of Autumn, and abated the price of Corne, as the Inhabitants relate; Some conjecture, that Pul&s;e by &s;hipwracks is ca&s;t upon the &s;hore, and &s;o u&s;es to grow without any miracle. But the like &s;pontaneous Harve&s;t we have ob&s;erved to be on the &s;hore of Kent every year.</P>
<P N="17">17. Ten miles further, along the Sea-coa&s;t you come to <HI>Dunwich,</HI> where <HI>An.</HI> 630. <HI>Felix</HI> the <HI>Burgundian</HI> fixt his Epi&s;copall See, and his Succe&s;&s;ors a long time governed all the Ea&s;t of <HI>England;</HI> but now the violence of the waves
<PB N="6" REF="6">
having carryed away the greate&s;t part of it, the Bi&s;hops having many ages &s;ince removed their Chair thence; It &s;its in &s;adne&s;s, and al|mo&s;t in &s;olitude. A little higher the River <HI>Blith</HI> emptieth it felf into the Sea, on who&s;e bank is &s;eated a &s;mall Town, <HI>Blithborow,</HI> which hath a Market by favour of <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Clavering.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. Here runns farther into the Ea&s;t, the Promontory <HI>Ea&s;ton-ne&s;s,</HI> e&s;teemed the mo&s;t Ea|&s;tern point of all <HI>Britain;</HI> and is called by <HI>Ptolomy, Exten&s;io.</HI> On the South of it lies <HI>Southwold</HI> in a plain open to the Sea; a Town frequented for the Havens &s;ake, which the river <HI>Blith</HI> entring the &s;ea, makes there; and when the Tide comes, &s;o &s;ur|rounded with the waters, that it &s;eemeth an Iland, and you would wonder it is not overflown. More inward you have <HI>VVingfield</HI> and <HI>Dunnington:</HI> and not far off <HI>Huntingfeild;</HI> and nearer it <HI>Heven|ingham,</HI> the &s;eat of a Noble Family that have their name thence: at a little di&s;tance is <HI>Hales|worth,</HI> now the Seat of the <HI>Alingtons.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. On the North; this Province, as we &s;aid, is divided from <HI>Norfolk</HI> by two &s;mall Rivers, <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> and <HI>VVaveney;</HI> both which i&s;&s;uing out of a pla&s;hy place at <HI>Lophamford,</HI> their &s;prings being very little di&s;tant, drive their &s;hallow &s;treams divers wayes. Upon <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> which runneth We&s;t, nothing offers it &s;elf on this &s;ide worthy of me|mory: upon <HI>VVaveney,</HI> that runneth Ea&s;t, you &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Hoxon</HI> fir&s;t, enobled by the Martyrdome of <HI>K. Edmund.</HI> Near it, at <HI>Broom,</HI> hath long dwelt the noble Family of <HI>Cornwallis.</HI> Lower is <HI>Eay, i.e.
<PB N="7" REF="6">
I&s;le,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e it is watered round about.</P>
<P N="20">20. Thence <HI>Waveney</HI> runns down by <HI>Flixton</HI> (for <HI>Felixton,</HI> from the fir&s;t Bp. <HI>Felix,</HI> as many other places were al&s;o named from him) and almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;eth <HI>Bungey.</HI> A little below neer the Bank, you &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Mettingham.</HI> And now <HI>Waveney</HI> approaching to the Sea, and attempting in vain to go two wayes thither, one by the River <HI>Garienis,</HI> another by the Lake <HI>Luthing,</HI> makes a fair <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> named by &s;ome <HI>Lovingland,</HI> by others, more truly, <HI>Luthingland,</HI> from that long and diffu&s;ed Lake, which beginning at the &s;hore of the Ocean reacheth to the river <HI>Garienis.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. At the entrance of which <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> a little Town <HI>Le&s;troffe</HI> lies upon the Sea, at the end of it <HI>Gorlston.</HI> Inward upon <HI>Waveny</HI> is &s;eated <HI>Somerly,</HI> and higher, where <HI>Garienis</HI> and <HI>Waveny</HI> mingle them&s;elves <HI>Cnobersburg,</HI> which we now call <HI>Burgh-Castle,</HI> being onely ruined walls, enriched with <HI>Roman</HI> Coynes often found there.</P>

<HEAD>GLOCESTER--SHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>_THe primary Seat of the Old <HI>Dobuni,</HI> hath <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Hereford-&s;hire</HI> on the We&s;t, <HI>Worce&s;ter-&s;hire</HI> on the North, on the Ea&s;t, <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Warwick-&s;hire; Wilt-&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire</HI> on the South: a Country plea&s;ant and fertile, &s;tretched forth from the Summer-ri&s;ing of the Sun to winter|&s;etting.</P>
<P N="2">2. The more Ea&s;tern part rai&s;ing it &s;elf in Hills is known by the name of <HI>Cotswold;</HI> the mid&s;t is &s;unk and fallen into a mo&s;t fruitfull Plain, and watered by the mo&s;t noble River <HI>Severn,</HI> that gives a vital force and verdure unto the Felds: the more We&s;tern part beyond <HI>Severn</HI> is all &s;haded with Woods.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Region, &s;aith <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> is called from the principall Town, <HI>The Vale of Gloce&s;ter;</HI> all the Land rich in Corn, and abounding in fruit: You may behold the High-wayes ap|parrelled as it were were with Apple-trees and Pear-trees, not by the indu&s;try of Plantation, but by the very nature of the Soil. A Region, more than any other Province in <HI>England,</HI> plentifull in Vines, of a more delightfull ta&s;te, the wines being very gratefull to the palate,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
and not much inferiour to your <HI>French</HI> wines in &s;weetne&s;s, &amp;c. No marvel &s;o many places in the&s;e parts retain the name of <HI>Vineyards,</HI> yielding wine heretofore; and it is rather to be imputed to the ill-husbandry of the Inhabitants, than the decay of Nature, that there is none pre&s;&s;ed at this day.</P>
<P N="4">4. The more We&s;tern part, on the other &s;ide <HI>Severn</HI> (po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of old by the <HI>Silures</HI>) even to the <HI>Wye</HI> (a River running betwixt <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>England</HI>) is full of deep woods, the <HI>Forre&s;t of Dean,</HI> &s;o called, either from a little Town of that name, or, as I conjecture, from <HI>Arden,</HI> &s;ignifying both among the <HI>Galls</HI> and <HI>Brittains, a wood:</HI> the Forre&s;t is now, &s;ince the Iron|works there, grown thinner than heretofore.</P>
<P N="5">5. Here is <HI>Avone,</HI> of mo&s;t ancient memory, mentioned by <HI>Antoninus,</HI> now called <HI>Aventon,</HI> a little Village, probably &s;o called from <HI>Avon,</HI> which to the <HI>Britains</HI> &s;ignifies a River.</P>
<P N="6">6. The river <HI>Severn</HI> (Brit. <HI>Huffron</HI>) having gone a long journey in a narrower channel, where it fir&s;t enters this Shire, receives the river <HI>Avon,</HI> and another little &s;tream from the Ea&s;t, between which is &s;eated <HI>Tewkesbury,</HI> &s;o called from <HI>Theoc</HI> the Hermite here, a large and fair Town, having three Bridges, noted for clothing, and who&s;e Mu&s;tard for biting is become Proverbial, being made up in balls.</P>
<P N="7">7. Lower, on the bank of <HI>Severn,</HI> lies <HI>Deorhist,</HI> and &s;uffers much damage by the

<P N="8">8. <HI>Severn</HI> goes on in a winding cour&s;e, and dividing it &s;elf, to make an I&s;land of the green and fertile meadowes, wa&s;hes the City <HI>Glocester,</HI> which <HI>Antonine</HI> calls <HI>Glevum,</HI> the Britains <HI>Caer Glowi,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Fair City.</HI> It was built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> to awe the <HI>Silures,</HI> and a Colony was brought thither, named <HI>Colonia Glevum.</HI> The City is built along upon the river, and the other &s;ide is in part fortified by a very &s;trong wall. The Streets are indeed very neat; and they were adorned with many Churches: The principall Church, or <HI>Colledge,</HI> was built by <HI>Aldred</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> and had a Dean, with 6 Prebendaries: above the Quire, there is a &s;emicircular vault, a <HI>Whi&s;pering-place,</HI> built with that artifice, that a very &s;oft voice is conveyed between the walls, from one end to the other, to the admiration of the hearers.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Severn</HI> bidding farewell to <HI>Glocester,</HI> u|niteth her divided forces, and fighteth often with a violent Tide, and bends her cour&s;e to the Ocean, on the way vi&s;iting <HI>Barkley,</HI> a Town of good note, having a Major to govern it, and a Ca&s;tle, honoured by the ancient Nobility of her Lords, the Barons of <HI>Barkley.</HI></P>
