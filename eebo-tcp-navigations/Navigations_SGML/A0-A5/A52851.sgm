<P>On the morrow, being well refre&s;ht with &s;leep, the wind cea&s;ed, and the weather was very warm; we went down the Rocks on the Sands at low Water, where we found great part of our lading, either on &s;hore or floating near it. I by the help of my company, dragged mo&s;t of it on &s;hore; what was too heavy for us we broke, and unbound the Casks and Che&s;ts, and, taking out the goods, &s;ecured all; &s;o that we wanted no clothes, nor any other provi&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary for Hou&s;ekeeping, to furni&s;h a better Hou&s;e than any we were like to have; but no Victuals (the &s;alt Water having &s;poiled all) onely one Cask of Bisket, being lighter than the re&s;t was dry; this &s;erved for Bread a while, and we found no Land a &s;ort of fowl about the bigne&s;&s;e of a Swan, very heavy and fat, that by rea&s;on of their weight could not fly, of the&s;e we found little difficulty to kill, &s;o that they were our pre&s;ent food; we carried out of <HI>England</HI> certain Hens and Cocks to eat by the way, &s;ome of the&s;e when the Ship was broken, by &s;ome means got to Land, and bred exceedingly, &s;o that in the future they were a great help unto us; we found al&s;o, by a little River, in the flags, &s;tore of eggs, of a &s;ort of fowl much like our Ducks, which were very good meat, &s;o that we want|ed nothing to keep us alive.</P>
<P>On the morrow, which was the third day, as &s;oon as it was morning, &s;eeing nothing to di&s;turb us, I lookt out a convenient place to dwell in, that we might build us a Hut to &s;helter us from the weather, and from any other danger of annoyance, from wild Bea&s;ts (if any &s;hould find us out): So clo&s;&s;e by a large Spring which ro&s;e out of a high hill over looking the Sea; on the &s;ide of a Wood, having a pro&s;pect towards the Sea (by the help of an Ax and &s;ome other implements, for we had all nece&s;&s;aries, the working of the Sea, having ca&s;t up mo&s;t of our goods) I cut down all the &s;treighte&s;t poles I could find, and which were enough for my purpo&s;e, by the help of my company, (nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="5" REF="4">being our Ma&s;ter) I digged holes in the earth, &s;etting my poles at an equal di&s;tance, and nailing the broken boards of the Casks, Che&s;ts, and Cabins, and &s;uch like to them, making my door to the Seaward, and having covered the top, with Sail clothes &s;train'd, and nail'd; I in the &s;pace of a week had made a large Cabbin big enough to hold all our goods and our &s;elves in it; I al&s;o placed our Hamocks for lodging, purpo&s;ing (if it plea&s;ed God to &s;end any Ship that way) we might be tran&s;ported home, but it never came to pa&s;s, the place, wherein we were (as I conceived) being much out of the way.</P>
<P>We having now lived in this manner full four moneths, and not &s;o much as &s;eeing or hearing of any wild people or of any of our own company, more then our &s;elves (they be|ing found now by experience to be all drowned) and the place as we after found, being a large I&s;land, and di&s;joyned, and out of &s;ight of any other Land, was wholly uninhabited by any people, neither was there any hurtful bea&s;t to annoy us. But on the contrary, the Countrey &s;o very plea&s;ant, being always clothed with green, and full of plea&s;ant fruits, and variety of Birds, ever warm, and never colder then in <HI>Eng|land</HI> in <HI>September:</HI> &s;o that this place (had it the culture that skilful people might be&s;tow on it) would prove a <HI>Para|di&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Woods afforded us a &s;ort of Nuts, as big as a large Apple, who&s;e kernil being plea&s;ant and dry, we made u&s;e of in&s;tead of Bread, that Fowl before mentioned, and a &s;ort of Water-fowl like Ducks, and their Eggs, and a Bea&s;t about the &s;ize of a Goat, and almo&s;t &s;uch a like Creature, which brought two young ones at a time, and that twice a year, of which the Low Lands and Woods were very full, being a very harmle&s;s Creature and tame, &s;o that we could ea&s;ily take and kill them: Fi&s;h al&s;o, e&s;pecially Shell-fi&s;h (which we could be&s;t come by) we had great &s;tore of, &s;o that in effect as to Food we wanted nothing; and thus, and by &s;uch like helps, we continued &s;ix moneths, without any di&s;turbance or want.</P>
<P>Idlene&s;s and fulne&s;s of every thing begot in me a de&s;ire
<PB N="6" REF="5">of enjoying the Women, beginning now to grow more fa|miliar. I had per&s;waded the two Maids to let me lie with them, which I did at fir&s;t in private, but after, cu&s;tome tak|ing away &s;hame (there being none but us) we did it more openly, as our Lu&s;t gave us liberty; afterwards my Ma&s;ters Daughter was content al&s;o to do as we did; the truth is, they were all hand&s;ome women, when they had clothes, and well &s;haped, feeding well. For we wanted no Food, and li|ving idlely, and &s;eeing us at liberty to do our wills, without hope of ever returning home made us thus bold: One of the fir&s;t of my Con&s;orts, with whom I fir&s;t accompanied (the talle&s;t and hand&s;ome&s;t) proved pre&s;ently with child, the &s;e|cond was my Ma&s;ters Daughter, and the other al&s;o not long after fell into the &s;ame condition: none now remaining but my <HI>Megro,</HI> who &s;eeing what we did, longed al&s;o for her &s;hare one night, I being a&s;leep, my <HI>Negro</HI> (with the con|&s;ent of others) got clo&s;e to me, thinking it being dark to begule me, but I awaking and feeling her, and perceiving who it was, yet willing to try the difference, &s;atisfied my &s;elf with her, as well as with one of the re&s;t; that night al|though the fir&s;t time, &s;he proved al&s;o with child, &s;o that in the year of our being here, all my women were with child by me, and they all coming at different &s;ea&s;ons, were a great help to one another.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t brought me a brave boy, my Ma&s;ters Daughter was the younge&s;t &s;he brought me a Girl, &s;o did the other Maid, who being &s;omething fat &s;ped wor&s;e at her labour, <HI>the</HI> Negro <HI>had no pain at all, and brought me a fine white Girle, &s;o I had one Boy, and three Girles:</HI> the Women were &s;oon well again, <HI>and the two fir&s;t with child again, before the two la&s;t were brought to bed:</HI> My cu&s;tome being not to lie with any of them after they were with child, till other were &s;o like|wi&s;e; <HI>and not with the Black, at all after: &s;he was with child:</HI> which commonly was at the fir&s;t tiem, I lay with her, which <HI>was in the night and not el&s;e,</HI> my &s;tomach would not &s;erve me, although &s;he was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t Blacks, I had &s;een, and her children as comely as any fo the re&s;t; <HI>we had no clothes for them, and therefore when they had &s;uckt, we &s;aid, them in M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e to &s;leep, and took no further care of them,</HI> for we knew, when they were gone more would come; the Wo|men
<PB N="7" REF="5">never failing once a year at lea&s;t, and none of the Children (for all the hard&s;hip we put them to) were ever &s;ick; &s;o that wanting now nothing but Cloathes, nor them much neither, other then for decency, the warmth of the Countrey and Cu&s;tome &s;upplying that Defect, we were now well &s;atisfied with our condition, our Family beginning to grow large, and there being nothing to hurt us, we many times lay abroad on Mo&s;&s;ey Banks, under the &s;helter of &s;ome Trees, or &s;uch like (for having nothing el&s;e to do) I had made me &s;everal Arbors to &s;leep in with my Women in the heat of the day, in the&s;e I and my Women pa&s;&s;ed the time away, they being never willing to be out of my company.</P>
<P>And having now no thought of ever returning home, as having re&s;olved and &s;worn each to other, never to part or leave one another, or the place; having by my &s;everal Wives, forty &s;even Children, Boys and Girls, but mo&s;t Girls, and growing up apace, we were all of us very fle&s;hy, the Coun|try &s;o well agreeing with us, that we never ailed any thing; my <HI>Negro</HI> having had twelve, was the fir&s;t that left bearing, &s;o I never medled with her more: My Ma&s;ters Daughter (by whom I had mo&s;t Children, being the younge&s;t and hand|&s;ome&s;t) was mo&s;t fond of me, and I of her. Thus we lived for &s;ixteen years, till perceiving my elde&s;t Boy to mind the ordinary work of Nature, by &s;eeing what we did, I gave him a Mate, and &s;o I did to all the re&s;t, as fa&s;t as they grew up, and were capable: My Wives having left bearing, my chil|dren began to breed apace, &s;o we were like to be a multitude; My fir&s;t Wife brought me thirteen Children, my &s;econd &s;even, my Ma&s;ters Daughter fifteen, and the <HI>Negro</HI> twelve, in all forty &s;even.</P>
<P>After we had lived there twenty two years, my <HI>Negro</HI> died &s;uddenly, but I could not percive any thing that ailed her; mo&s;t of my children being grown, as fa&s;t as we married them, I &s;ent them and placed them over the River by them&s;elves &s;e|verally, becau&s;e we would not pe&s;ter one another; and now they being all grown up, and gone, and married after our man|ner (&s;ome two or three of the younge&s;t) for (growing my &s;elf into years) I liked not the wanton annoyance of young company.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>Thus having lived to the &s;ixtieth year of my age, and the fortieth of my coming thither, at which time I &s;ent for all of them to bring their children, and there were in number de&s;cended from me by the&s;e four Women, of my Children, Grand-children, &amp; great Grand-children, five hundred &s;ixty five of both &s;orts; I took off the Males of one Family, and marri|ed them to the Females of another, not letting any to marry their &s;i&s;ters, as we did formerly out of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o ble&s;&s;ing God for his Providence and goodne&s;s, I di&s;mi&s;t them, I having taught &s;ome of my Children to read formerly, for I had left &s;till the Bible, I charged it &s;hould be read once a moneth at a general meeting: At la&s;t one of my Wives died being &s;ixty eighth years of age, which I buried in a place, &s;et out on pur|po&s;e, and within a year after another, &s;o I had none now left but my Ma&s;ters Daughter, and we lived together twelve years longer, at length &s;he died al&s;o, &s;o I buried her al&s;o next the place where I purpo&s;ed to be buried my &s;elf, and the tall Maid my fir&s;t Wife next me on the other &s;ide, the <HI>Negro</HI> next without her, and the other Maid next my Ma&s;ters Daughter. I had now nothing to mind, but the place whether I was to go, being very old, almo&s;t eighty years, I gave my Cabin and Furniture that was left to my elde&s;t &s;on after my decea&s;e, who had married my elde&s;t Daughter by my be|loved Wife, whom I made King and Governour of all the re&s;t: I informed them of the Manners of <HI>Europe,</HI> and charged them to remember the Chri&s;tian Religion, after the manner of them that &s;pake the &s;ame Language, and to admit no other, if hereafter any &s;hould come and find them out.</P>
<P>And now once for all, I &s;ummoned them to come to me, that I might number them, which I did, and found the e&s;timate to con|tain in or about the eightieth year of my age, and the fifty ninth of my coming there; in all of all &s;orts one thou&s;and &s;even hundred eighty and nine. Thus praying God to multi|ply them, and &s;end them the true light of the Go&s;pel, I la&s;t of all di&s;mi&s;t them: For, being now very old, and my &s;ight decayed, I could not expect to live long.
