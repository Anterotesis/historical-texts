<HEAD>A Reply to an An&s;wer from a Friend, to the Apology for the Engli&s;h Nation; that the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> &s;hould be free.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen I de&s;ired your Opinion of the Apology for the Engli&s;h Nation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I expected you would have fir&s;t an&s;wered where I began; <HI>viz.</HI> That all Nations, as well as the Inhabitants of Nations, by Equal Right or the Law of Nature, may entertain Trade and Commerce with one a|nother: and if in Times of Peace Humane Laws &s;hall debar Subjects of this Right, this is practi&s;ing Iniquity by a Law: And that you would have Objected again&s;t the Rea&s;ons, which the Parliament gave 3 <HI>Jac. C.</HI> 6. for the freedom of the Engli&s;h in the Spani&s;h Trade; or that the&s;e Rea&s;ons did not hold in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, but of the&s;e you &s;ay not one word&punc;</P>
<P><HI>You &s;ay when you were in</HI> London, <HI>all Men Agreed the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Trade could not be driven, without a Company, becau&s;e of the Power of the</HI> Dutch <HI>in tho&s;e Seas.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you mi&s;take me in contending again&s;t a Company Exclu|&s;ive to all others&punc; for it is not a Company I contend again&s;t; but the Exclu&s;ion of all others: For your &s;eeming Rea&s;on of the <HI>Dutch</HI> power in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> to nece&s;&s;itate a Trade by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in a Company, it will not hold; unle&s;s you can make an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company to be equal to the <HI>Dutch</HI> in power, which can never be hoped for; but if it could&punc; it could never be by Excluding others, which might contribute to the Encrea&s;e of it.</P>
<P>For the In&s;tance you give of the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade; it hath no re&s;em|blance to the Trade in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> For our Trade to <HI>Turkey,</HI> is up|on the Matter, but to one place, <HI>viz. Smyrna;</HI> whereas that which the Company call the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, is to all the Parts on the Ea&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Southern Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to the North of <HI>China,</HI> with all
<PB N="4" REF="3"> the I&s;lands which lye in that va&s;t Ocean; &s;o that for ought is known Tenfold the Trade might be managed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, if the Trade were free, than to <HI>Turky;</HI> which is impo&s;&s;ible to be done by one Com|pany exclu&s;ive to all others; in the numerous and va&s;t Dominions in tho&s;e parts of the World.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Objection which you make of the <HI>Dutch</HI> power in tho&s;e Seas, to exclude all others but a Company is a Topick &s;et up only by the Favourers of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; for unle&s;s you &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> power to he more than that of all the Princes of <HI>Africk, A&s;ia,</HI> and all the I&s;lands in the va&s;t Ocean, the&s;e cannot give Laws to them, all; and this is an Argument which the Company, them&s;elves do not be|lieve, for if granted, Interlopers could never Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which is the greate&s;t fear the Company have.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e all the Princes in <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> could not protect the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their Trade with them; yet &s;ure a King of <HI>England</HI> is not &s;o faln from power, but that he is able to protect his Subjects in all their Ju&s;t Trades from the Violences and Oppre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You &s;ay the Commons had rea&s;on to refer the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Erecting a new</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Company to the King, they having &s;o little time to Sit.</HI></P>
<P>The Commons had bu&s;ied them&s;elves above four Months in E&s;ta|bli&s;hing this Company, more than in any thing el&s;e, and then threw it upon the King, who in the Circum&s;tances he is in, cannot attend it four days.</P>
<P><HI>But you &s;ay you doubt not but the Commons upon their next Sitting, will a&s;&s;ume this Bu&s;ine&s;s again, and then will undoubtedly Blow up the pre&s;ent Com|pany.</HI> But this will be more &s;trange than to Vote an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany exclu&s;ive to all others, to be E&s;tabli&s;hed by Act of Parliament; and then to throw it upon the King; and after to take it out of the power of the King.</P>
<P>But here you may &s;ee how Indu&s;triou&s;ly Men pur&s;ue their Intere&s;t, without any regard to Ju&s;tice or Prudence: For all this time in propa|gating an <HI>East India</HI> Company exclu&s;ive to other Men, no regard is had how the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might be &s;ecured from the Violences and Injuries of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in it; nor how it can be carried on by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the mi&s;erable and di&s;tracted &s;tate, the now Company have brought it to, with the <HI>Mogull, Sophy</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and King of <HI>Syam.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> power in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> is va&s;tly more than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> yet to maintain this, they are at as va&s;t Charges in maintaining it, &s;o that where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade, with all the other Princes of the <HI>Indies, Per&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade is &s;o much cheaper, as they are at le&s;s Charges in maintaining their Dominions, nor can it be ever hoped the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with or without a Company can expel the <HI>Dutch</HI> out of their Dominions in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>It's true, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have been as Injurious to this pre&s;ent Company (if Injuries can be done to &s;uch a Company of Men) as the Company has been to the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation: For be&s;ides the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> which was not in this Companies time; they Outed the Com|pany from <HI>Polloroon,</HI> where the Natives could not protect them, and was a principal cau&s;e of the &s;econd <HI>Dutch</HI> War in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond's Reign: And by fal&s;hood kept the Company from Trading to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> alledging the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were Chri&s;tians; and the King had Married the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Daughter: (the <HI>Portuguez</HI> of all Na|tions being mo&s;t dete&s;tible to the <HI>Chine&s;s;</HI>) and now by joining with the young King of <HI>Bantam</HI> again&s;t his Father; they keep the King Pri|&s;oner, and make u&s;e of his Name, to expel the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from their Trade to <HI>Bantam</HI> for Pepper, &s;o as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are forced to Trade to the We&s;t of <HI>Sumatra</HI> for Pepper, a mo&s;t unhealthful place, where more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;e their Lives, than ten times the Trade is worth, of which the Company have no regard, &s;o as they could purcha&s;e a Pound of Pepper by the lo&s;s of ten <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men: The unhealthine&s;s of this place being repre&s;ented to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &s;he forbid her Subjects Trading to <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd <HI>Dutch</HI> War, the <HI>French</HI> joyned with King <HI>Charles</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and thereby the <HI>Dutch</HI> were reduced &s;o low, as they were in the War with the Rump Parliament; but the Parliament dreading the Con&s;equences, Petitioned the King to make a &s;eparate Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> without including the <HI>French;</HI> but this prevailed but little, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, the Marque&s;s <HI>Del Fre&s;no</HI> interpo&s;ed, threat|ning other ways, <HI>Spain</HI> would break with <HI>England,</HI> and then the King made a &s;eparate ha&s;ty Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> whereby a Regulation of Trade was agreed to be &s;ettled, and adju&s;ted in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> by certain Commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Per&s;uant hereto, the 9th. of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1673. &s;ix Commi&s;&s;ioners named by the King, entred into a Treaty, with Six &s;ent by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> who were to &s;ettle the Regulations and adju&s;t the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> in three Months time; and what was not &s;ettled in that time, was to be referred to the Queen Regent of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was to Name Eleven Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Major part whereof was to deter|mine what was not &s;ettled; provided they gave their Judgment with|in Six Months to be computed from the time they met; which was to be within three Months after the Queen had taken this Award upon her. But tho' the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;et more than three times the time limitted for Adju&s;ting the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade; <HI>viz.</HI> till the fir&s;t of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1674. yet they concluded nothing in it, nor was ever any further Refe|rence to the Queen Regent of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>Thus this Prince <HI>Charles</HI> the Second having joined with the <HI>French</HI> in a War again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to the Di&s;turbance of the peace of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ions and Wrongs done the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their Trades in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> Now to get 800000 Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">oons of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a round Sum of Money from the Parliament, makes a &s;e|parate Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and leaves the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their Trades to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> in the &s;ame &s;tate it was before: And &s;ure the co&s;iderati|on hereof had been more worthy the wi&s;dom of the Commons, than their Debates Four Months together to E&s;tabli&s;h an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company exclu&s;ive to all others.</P>
<P>Nor can I imagine how this Intended Exclu&s;ive Company by the Commons, or any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, can Trade to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s or King of <HI>Syam</HI>'s Dominions, before the Differences made by this Companies War with them be Adju&s;ted; you cannot believe we have a true Repre&s;entation of them from the Company; nor do I be|lieve the Company them&s;elves under&s;tand them: And do you think the <HI>Mogull</HI> or King of <HI>Syam,</HI> will &s;it down by the Lo&s;s? Or that it is rea|&s;onable, the Kings other Subjects, which the Company have denied the Benefit of the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> &s;hould be liable to pay their Debts there; and make Re&s;titution for all the Violences and Deprada|tions the Company have committed.</P>
<P>But admit the Company be in a condition to pay the Expence of this War, and their Debts contracted in it, which Mr. <HI>White</HI> computes to be Seventeen Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds; its probable the Company ha|ving &s;pent all the Money there, mu&s;t return it thither out of <HI>England;</HI> and I think at this time the Nation is not in a condition to part with &s;uch a Sum; and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> when the&s;e things had been Adju&s;ted, it had been time enough to have debated, whether the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade might been better carried on by a Company exclu&s;ive to all others, or that it &s;hould be free.</P>
<P>So I leave it to you to judge, whether it be not more to be wi&s;hed, that the King will plea&s;e to Adju&s;t and Regulate thee Trade of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> e&s;pecially concerning the Trades to <HI>Amboyna, Poll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> and <HI>Ban|tam;</HI> and &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors to the <HI>Mogull</HI> and King of <HI>Syam,</HI> to vin|dicate the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation from the Violences and Rapines which the Company have committed upon their Subjects; and to in&s;pect the &s;tate of Affairs in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> as they now &s;tand; and to enter into a Treaty of Commerce with the <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia, Mogull,</HI> the Empe|ror of <HI>China,</HI> and other Princes of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> with whom the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> &s;hall Trade; before he Erect any Company to Trade to all the&s;e Princes, and be thereby Liable to the Violences of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to make &s;atisfaction for all the Debts and Depradations of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">w Company.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="4">
<P>I agree with you that the Company have no Right to the Half Cu|&s;toms of Goods vended in the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> nor that they ever paid any thing for them, yet more than double the worth of all the Joint|&s;tock the Company imployed in this Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> And that the&s;e Cu&s;toms ought to be imployed in Building Forts in proper places for &s;ecuring the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traffick in tho&s;e Seas: And that when the&s;e Moneys are not &s;o Imployed, they are due to the King.</P>
<P>We agree too, that the <HI>African</HI> Company is Injurious to the Nation in the Vent of our Native Commodities; and in our Trades to the Plan|tations; nor is this Company le&s;s injurious to the Nation in their re|turns: For a Worker in Ivory a&s;&s;ured me within three days, that the Company has rai&s;ed the prizes of Elephants Teeth, threefold more than when the Trade was free; and what is this but to impo&s;e a dear|ne&s;s upon all Ivory Manufactures at Home, and to E&s;tabli&s;h the For|reign Vent of them to the <HI>Dutch, French,</HI> and other Nations to our Lo&s;s, and undoing of Thou&s;ands of people, who other ways might be em|ployed in them. <HI>Ex ungue Leonem;</HI> by this you may judge of the re&s;t?</P>
