<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>Cap. 1. &para; Of the partes of this new A&s;trolabe.</HEAD>
<P>_THis <HI>A&s;trolabe</HI> hath three generall partes, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Cele&s;tiall,</HI> the <HI>Zenitfer</HI> with his <HI>Cur&s;or,</HI> and the <HI>Almicantifer</HI> with his <HI>Pointer.</HI></P>
<P>I call that part the <HI>Cele&s;tiall</HI> heere, which in other A&s;trolabes is called the <HI>Mate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> of which I will largely &s;peake in the next Chap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zenitfer</HI> beeing but as a playne rule of one ynch bredth, mooueth vpon the <HI>Cele&s;tiall</HI> in &s;tead of a <HI>Reete</HI> v&s;ed in other A&s;trolabes: and hath a circular Lymbe thereto annexed neere vnto the Centre, which I call the <HI>Circulus horarius,</HI> or houre circle, with the 24. houres, and their partes thereon, as you &s;ee. Neither is it materiall of what quantity that houre circle or lymbe be of, &s;o it be con|centricke to the A&s;trolabe, and placed &s;o, that it hide fewe&s;t Starres in his moouing. And for &s;eruice of this circle, there is written at the vpper end of this Zenitfer <HI>Meridies,</HI> and at
<PB REF="6"> the lower end <HI>Media nox,</HI> and therefore the fiduciall line thereof from the Centre vpwards to <HI>Meridies,</HI> is generally called the <HI>Noone line,</HI> the other part from the Centre downe|wardes vnto <HI>Media nox</HI> the <HI>North line.</HI> Then hath it 90 <HI>Zenith lines</HI> &s;tanding in a&s;cents one aboue another like Or|gan pipes, in &s;tead of the 90 generall <HI>Horizons</HI> before time v&s;ed, i&s;&s;uing or growing out of the 90 <HI>Zenith points:</HI> for the lowe&s;t points of the&s;e 90 lines neere&s;t vnto the centre vnto which their numbers are &s;et from 0 to 90, do repre&s;ent the true <HI>Zenithes</HI> of all places. The&s;e 90. <HI>Zenith lines,</HI> are by certaine thwart curued lines parted euery one into 90 vn|euen parts, of which &s;ome run out infinitely, and tho&s;e partes I call the <HI>Altitude rootes,</HI> or the <HI>Almicantare rootes,</HI> and for breuities &s;ake &s;ometimes <HI>Rootes</HI> without any addition. The&s;e <HI>Rootes</HI> do helpe vs to generall <HI>Almicantares,</HI> or circles of Altitude for any Latitude by a rare deui&s;e by me fir&s;t found out. They are numbered on the outer &s;ide of the <HI>Zenitfer</HI> from their extreame points inwards towards their &s;ayd <HI>Zenith points,</HI> ending at them with 90. Al&s;o to the Fiduciall line of this <HI>Zenitfer</HI> is anexed a &s;cale, in which are planted the Ra|diall degrees of the proiectement on both &s;ides of the Scale, becau&s;e they require double numbering for &s;undry purpo&s;es. And of tho&s;e which bound on the Fiduciall line, tho&s;e at the noone line are numbered from the Equinoctiall inter&s;ection both waies, <HI>vz.</HI> towards <HI>Meridies,</HI> as farre as the <HI>Zenithfer</HI> will giue leaue, which are about 36, and towards the Centre, ending there at 90. which 90 radiall degrees of the noone line towards the Centre do &s;erue (with the other 36) to de&s;cry the declinations of the fixed Starres and Planets, but chiefely they &s;erue for the 90 Zenithes which appertaine to the 90 generall Horizons, and for di&s;tinction &s;ake I call them the 90 <HI>Verticall points,</HI> and they exactly an&s;were vnto the 90. lower ends of the 90 <HI>Zenith lines,</HI> which before I called the 90 <HI>Ze|nith points,</HI> in &s;o much that the fiduciall line of the <HI>Cur&s;or</HI> in his moouing, cutteth the <HI>Zenith point,</HI> and the <HI>Verticall point</HI>
<PB REF="6"> of any latitude both at once. The other <HI>Radiall</HI> degrees in the <HI>North line,</HI> are numbred from the centre towards <HI>Media nox,</HI> ending at the Equinoctials inter&s;exion therewith at 90, and do &s;erue for the 90 inter&s;ections of the 90 generall <HI>Horizons</HI> therewith, and therefore I call them the 90 <HI>Horizontall points.</HI> And of tho&s;e radyall degrees which bound on the other &s;ide of the Scale, which indeede &s;erue to the getting of the 12 hou&s;es generally, as is &s;hewed in the 27 Cap. The Norther 90 towards <HI>Media nox</HI> are numbred inwards to|wards the Centre, ending there at 90 contrary to the former. And the Souther of tho&s;e radiall degrees are numbred from the Centre outwards towards <HI>Meridies</HI> two to one, as farre as they will go, (that is to &s;ay) euery 10 make but 5, and the&s;e do &s;erue but in &s;tead of rootes to the other, and there|fore I call them the <HI>Domifieng rootes.</HI> Al&s;o there adioyneth vnto the Radiall &s;cale of the North line betweene the centre and the Zenith lines a certaine &s;cale of &s;lope lines numbered in the midde&s;t, beginning but from 60 and ending at the centre with 90, which I call the <HI>Domifieng Scale,</HI> for that the two extreames of euery of tho&s;e &s;lope lines, do help to get 8 of the 12 hou&s;es in that latitude, who&s;e number it &s;heweth, as in the 27 Cap. is manife&s;ted: and vnto the outer edge of this <HI>Domifieng &s;cale,</HI> are al&s;o anexed part of the former ra|diall degrees, all hauing relacion to them on the North line. Then hath this <HI>Zenitfer</HI> a certaine runner or <HI>Cur&s;or,</HI> who&s;e fiduciall line alwayes runneth exactly &s;quare to the fiduciall line of the <HI>Zenitfer.</HI> And at the common meeting of both tho&s;e fiduciall lines, this <HI>Cur&s;or</HI> hath iointed vnto him a kinde of Labell or loo&s;e &s;cale, which I call the <HI>Almicantifer,</HI> who to &s;upply the generall v&s;e of the <HI>Almicantares,</HI> hath no manner of matter on him but another <HI>Cur&s;or,</HI> which I call a <HI>Pointer.</HI></P>
<P>But now for any man that de&s;ireth to haue this A&s;tro|labe more particularly commodious for one latitude, <HI>vz.</HI> for the countrey or place of his abode, then &s;hall he haue a kinde
<PB REF="7"> of Reete or moouer made, carying a circle or limbe of houres of equall diametre to the <HI>Cele&s;tiall,</HI> and within it the <HI>Horizon</HI> circle of that place particularly de&s;cribed after <HI>Stophlerus,</HI> and graduated into his 360 pro&s;pectiue degrees, as in the fourth booke 4. Cap. of my Iewell is taught, toge|ther with the arches di&s;tingui&s;hing the 12 hou&s;es, as in <HI>Stoph. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>propo.</HI> 6. is taught, writing to each hou&s;e his number and &s;ignifications. And vnto the noone-line furni|&s;hed with the former radiall degrees, numbred from the <HI>Ho|rizon</HI> circle, into twi&s;e 90. both ending at the <HI>Verticall</HI> point, you &s;hall neede to annexe but only one of the 90 Zenith lines, <HI>vz.</HI> that which &s;erueth to your latitude and his rootes, with the <HI>Cur&s;or:</HI> Neither neede your <HI>Almicantifer</HI> haue his &s;liding pointer, but in &s;tead thereof, the particuler degrees of altitude &s;eruing to that latitude, which are compounded of his 90 Zenith rootes, and the 90 radiall degrees in the North line, as in the 19 Cap. is taught, all which &s;hall better appeare by &s;uch A&s;trolabes as I meane to &s;et abroade ready furni&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>Cap. 2. &para; Of the Cele&s;tiall proiectment in this new A&s;trolabe, and how the longitudes and latitudes of the Starres are thereby had.</HEAD>
<P>_NEedle&s;&s;e it is to &s;tand vpon the Fa|brication, or long particularizing of this In&s;trument or his partes, &s;ince they are but the <HI>Copernician</HI> repre&s;entation of the con&s;tellations fixed, and the 90 generall <HI>Horizons</HI> moouing.</P>
<P>The Fixed part which in other A&s;trolabes is called the <HI>Mater,</HI> I call for breuities &s;ake the <HI>Cele&s;tiall,</HI> For that in it I haue
<PB REF="7"> pro&s;pectiuely proiected the Globe Cele&s;tiall, that is to &s;ay, the Globe of the fixed Starres, with the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and his North Pole (marked with <HI>D</HI>) the Images of each con&s;tel|lation, and the Starres appertaining, in &s;uch &s;ort as in the Globe they are v&s;uall, with each fift circle of Longitude and Latitude of the Zodiacke, Euery &s;ixe of tho&s;e fiues of the Longitude including a &s;igne in the heauens, being 12 in the whole, which 12 are di&s;tingui&s;hed with twi&s;ted lines &s;ome|what bigger from the re&s;t, and vnto them neere vnto the Limbe are written the names of the 12 Signes as they pa&s;&s;e in order, <HI>Aries, Taurus, &amp;c.</HI> together with their natures and quallities. Al&s;o, tho&s;e three Signes of the watry triplicitie are filled vp with waues, and the three fiery with flames, and the three earthy with bigge prickes, and the three ayry left white. Then are there &s;euen &s;euerall magnitudes of Starres, each bigger and brighter then other, who&s;e fa&s;hions are &s;et downe with their numbers in the Signe &Gemini; before the bre&s;t of <HI>Orion,</HI> by which they are ea&s;ily heerein de&s;cryed. The excentricke circle <HI>Orbs</HI> or Lymbe, lying wholy within it, is the Zodiacke deuided into his 12 Signes by the fore|&s;ayd 12 may&s;ter circles of longitude, and euery Signe into his 30 pro&s;pectiue degrees. Al&s;o the degrees are made with, diuers di&s;tingui&s;hments, for the <HI>Gradus ma&s;culini, feminini, lucidi, tenebro&s;i, vacui, fumo&s;i, puteales, fortunam augentes, &amp; debilitantes,</HI> all which are &s;ufficiently to be de&s;cryed by the two <HI>Directoria Zodiaci</HI> there placed. Then is there a little within the Zodiacke a rowe of Carecters of the Planets pla|ced at euery 10 circle of longitude, &s;ignifying the faces of the Planets, and likewi&s;e another rowe without the Zodiacke at the beginning of the termes of the Planets, euery face and terme continuing vnto the carect next him in <HI>&s;equens</HI> of the Zodiacke, all which will better appeare, if you ioyne vnto this booke <HI>Claudius Dariot</HI> his introduction to the iudge|ment of the Starres, which by good hap is now newly im|printed in engli&s;h together with this, and a &s;econd part there|with,
<PB REF="8"> which at the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion was omitted. And &s;peci|ally you mu&s;t note and remember well, that the very outer|mo&s;t circle of this Zodiacke, is the clipticke circle, within which is contayned the North-halfe or Hemi&s;pheere of all the Starres and Con&s;tellacions in the heauens, and without it &s;o many of the South Starres and Con&s;tellacions, as the proiectment would admit. Then is there al&s;o lying within this A&s;trolabe a blacke concentricke circle, repre&s;enting the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> circle, and proiector of this worke, but without any diui&s;ions, becau&s;e they are better &s;upplyed by the limbe. Al&s;o there is a &s;cale of the radiall degrees, where|on this proiectement is made, placed at the ma&s;ter circle of longit. beginning the Signe &Cancer; numbred from the Equi|noctiall both wayes, which Equinoctiall cutteth the &s;ayde eclipticke circle in the pointes <HI>B</HI> and <HI>C</HI> beginning &Aries; and &Libra;, and tho&s;e points are called the two <HI>Aequinoctiall Inter|&s;ectiones</HI> which do mooue vppon the poles of the <HI>Zodiacke</HI> backwards, or <HI>in precedentia,</HI> of the Signes euery 67 yeares almo&s;t a degree equally: carying about with them all the fore&s;ayde circles of Longitude and Latitude, leauing the Starres &s;tocke &s;till in their places, By which meanes it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that although the fixed Starres haue no manner of motion at all, yet they &s;eeme from time to time to haue gone as is &s;ayd euery 67 yeares almo&s;t a degree for|wards, as the auncient A&s;tronomers thought: where as in very deede (as <HI>Copernicus</HI> &s;heweth) the <HI>Zodiacke</HI> and all his circles do &s;lide &s;o much backwards from them: And by rea&s;on this &s;liding backe of the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> points, is as I haue &s;ayd performed on the poles <HI>D</HI> and his oppo&s;ite of the clipticke, therefore it commeth to pa&s;&s;e that the fixed Starres could thereby neuer change theyr Latitudes, but keepe the &s;ame Latitudes as euer they did. This &s;liding backe, is called <HI>Prece&s;&s;io Aequinoctiorum,</HI> of which wee will in|treate more in the 30 Cap. And now will returne to this proiectement: In which it is very ea&s;ye to imagine euery
<PB REF="8"> &s;quare into fiue equall partes, and &s;o thereby to knowe the Longitude and Latitude of any Starre therein &s;ufficient for any common v&s;e. As for example, the great Starre in the left foote of <HI>Orion,</HI> placed in the Signe &Gemini;, if you imagin the &s;paces betweene each fiue circles of Longitude and Lati|tude deuided into fiue partes, then &s;hall you conceaue that the middle pricke of this Starre is heere in longitude about 9 degrees 30 minut. of &Gemini;, and in latitude South from the clipticke circle about &s;ome 31 degrees 30 min. and &s;o for any of the re&s;t.</P>

<P>_MY good meaning determining this <HI>A&s;tro|labe</HI> as a fit recreacion or play-game for trauellers by Sea, to driue away the tedi|ou&s;nes of their iourneying, may &s;oone&s;t of all deceiue them in getting the true place of the &Sun;, whether by the <HI>Ephemeris,</HI> or by the la&s;t Cap. or by my <HI>Organum Vranicum,</HI> if they haue not a &s;peciall regard to the changing of their <HI>Meridians</HI> as they trauayle: for which cau&s;e, I haue cau&s;ed a new de&s;cription of the tere&s;triall Globe to be made after my fa&s;hion in one face, where others make them &s;till in two faces: and both that tere&s;triall and this cele&s;tiall, are principally meant by me to &s;erue vnto my <HI>Vranicum,</HI> and to be placed in the inner &s;ides of his ca&s;e as nece&s;&s;ary appendices, though of it|&s;elfe it bee an In&s;trument &s;ufficient without the&s;e. Of this tere&s;triall I doe at this time (although hauing ma|nye extraordinary conceites to applye him for Nauigati|on, and other nece&s;&s;ities to write of) determine to deli|uer but this Chapter, therein to let you vnder&s;tande,
<PB REF="13"> that in the limbe circle about it which repre&s;enteth the <HI>Ae|quinoctiall</HI> circle at the Meridian cutting vpon <HI>London,</HI> I haue placed a rundle with a cro&s;&s;e, and at the oppo&s;ite Meri|dian the number of 12. &s;ignifying 12 houres, and betweene the&s;e on both &s;ides are 11 other rundles for houres, &s;o is that whole circle deuided into twi&s;e 12 houres, and numbred both wayes from the cro&s;&s;e rundle, &s;ignifying how many houres the Sunne or any Planet or Starre hath to go from our Meridian at <HI>London</HI> (when any of them come vnto it) before it can come to the Meridian of another place, or being in a|nother place, how many houres it mu&s;t go ere it come to ours. And in regard that the gate of the &Sun; is euery 24 houres a de|gree of the-clipticke, therefore you mu&s;t adde or &s;ubtract from his place found either in the la&s;t Cap. or the <HI>Ephemeri|des,</HI> or my <HI>Vranicum,</HI> according to the rate thereof, <HI>vz.</HI> for euery 12 houres, about 30 minutes of a degree, and for 6 houres 15 minutes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As for example, admit you being a trauayler &s;hould be the fift day of March 1598 in the 4. Cap. mentioned in the great City of <HI>Quin&s;ay</HI> in the countrey of <HI>China,</HI> and there &s;eeking for the true place of the Sunne at noone, had found it 25 de|grees 3 minutes in &Pisces; as in the 4.

Now becau&s;e the Meridian of <HI>Quin&s;ay</HI> appeareth in this Tere&s;triall by the &s;aid houre rundles almo&s;t 9 houres di&s;tant from the Meri|dian of <HI>London</HI> or rather of <HI>Anwerp</HI> if you worke by <HI>Stadius Ephemerides,</HI> or the la&s;t Cap. and that towards the Ea&s;t: Therefore the &Sun; commeth &s;o much &s;ooner to the meridian or noone at <HI>Quin&s;ay,</HI> for which cau&s;e you mu&s;t in this ca&s;e re|bate &s;o much of the Sunnes diurnall gate of 60 minutes, as 9 houres commeth to, <HI>vz.</HI> 22 minutes, &s;o will the Sunne that day at noone in that countrye be but 24 degrees 41 min. in &Pisces;, which in the 4 Cap. was found to be 25 degrees 3 minutes in &Pisces;. And if your place had beene &s;o much We&s;t|wards, then &s;hould you haue added 22 minutes vnto 25 de|grees 3 minutes in &Pisces;. You may al&s;o performe the &s;ame
<PB REF="13"> reddily by the next Cap. applying the Labell vnto 30 minut. of the &s;extans, for &s;o much is the &s;emidiurnall gate of the Sunne commonly.</P>

<HEAD>Cap. 8. &para; How to know the declinacion and right a&s;cen|cion of any Planet, fixed Starre, or point of the heauens, and their degree of Culminacion.</HEAD>
<P>_THere are in the <HI>Mater,</HI> or <HI>Cele&s;tiall</HI> of this <HI>A&s;trolabe,</HI> to auoide confu&s;ion, only two &s;orts of circles delineated, &amp; tho&s;e are the circles of the-clipticks longitude and latitude in the 2. Cap. mentioned, i&s;&s;uing from his Pole <HI>D</HI> to his oppo&s;ite. And the very like vnto tho&s;e ought to haue been delineated, i&s;&s;uing from the Poles of the world, limitting the right a&s;&s;entions and declinations of the Starres, in regard of the Equinoctiall, and are commonly called Meridians and Paralells, which becau&s;e the nature of this proiectement doth ca&s;t the Meridians into &s;treight lines i&s;&s;uing from the Poles, both lodged in the Centre vnto euery of the 360 degrees of the Equinoctiall, or rather of the limbe and the parallells into concentricke circles, they are therefore &s;upplyed by playing about the radiall degrees
<PB REF="14"> of the noone-lines on the Centre, by the degrees of the limbe, and might as well be done by a thred &amp; pearle applyed to the radyall degrees of the Scale planted at the beginning of &Cancer;.</P>
<P>Further you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that countrey is &s;ayd to haue a right <HI>Horizon,</HI> vnto which &s;ome one of the Meridians is <HI>Horizon,</HI> that is to &s;ay, where the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> pa&s;&s;eth by the <HI>Zenith</HI> or point directly ouer head, called the <HI>Verticall point,</HI> and both the poles of the world euen with the <HI>Horizon,</HI> and neither of them eleuated, all other <HI>Horizons</HI> where either Pole is eleuated, are called oblique <HI>Horizons.</HI></P>
<P>Now therefore when you are to get the right a&s;cen&s;ion of any Planet-Starre, or point of the heauens a&s;&s;igned, you are but to learne what Meridian and Paralell cutteth the &s;ame, and if you do but lay the noone-line thereon, it &s;heweth you in the limbe the right a&s;cention, and in the &s;cale of the Radiall degrees on the noone-line the declinacion. For ex|ample, the Sunnes <HI>Apex</HI> placed at the 26 degree 3 minut. of &Pisces; by the 2 cap. lay the noone-line thereto, and it &s;hall &s;hewe you in the limbe 356 degrees 25 minutes his right a&s;|cencion, and among the radiall degrees of the noone-line 1 degr. 30 min. his declinacion, and that Southwards of the Equinoctiall. For the 5 day of March 1598 likewi&s;e apply the noone-line vnto the chiefe Carect of &Saturn; there placed at 2 degr. 27 min. in &Libra;, and in latitude 2 degr 44 min. North, and it &s;hall &s;hew you in the limbe 182 degrees his right a&s;|cencion, and among the radiall degrees, 1 degr. 10 min. his declinacion South from the equinoctiall the &s;ame 5 of March 1598. Againe, if for any Starre, as admit the great Starre of the fir&s;t light in or neere the eye of the Bull, called <HI>Ocu|lus tauri,</HI> the noone-line layd thereon, &s;heweth in the limbe 63 degrees 30 min. his right a&s;cencion, and 16 degrees his declinacion North from the equinoctiall, though he be in lati|tude South from the-clipticke, and it cutteth in the <HI>Zodiacke</HI> the 5 degree 35 min. of &Gemini; his degree of culminacion: for al|wayes y^e degree of the-clipticke which coa&s;cendeth or cutteth
<PB REF="15"> any Meridian or right <HI>Horizon</HI> with any Starre, or other point of the heauens, is called the degree of his <HI>Culminacion,</HI> becau&s;e the Meridian of any place is called <HI>Culmen Celi.</HI></P>

Al&s;o, that Starre which in this A&s;trolabe you &s;ee in the outermo&s;t tip of the tayle of <HI>Vr&s;a Minor,</HI> is commonly called the Pole &s;tarre, in Latin <HI>Stella polaris,</HI> or <HI>Cino&s;ura,</HI> which in this age is &s;ome 3 &frac12; degree di|&s;tant from the true North point or pole of the world, although the ordinary &s;ort take it to be the Pole it &s;elfe, yet in euery age to come by rea&s;on of the fore&s;aid &s;liding backe of the equi|noctiall points, he &s;hall draw neerer and neerer to the Pole vntill the yeare 2220 after Chri&s;t, and then &s;hall he be but 30 minutes from the Pole, and his longitude &s;hall be then 0 in &Cancer;, from whence he will then begin to elongate againe from the Pole till he come to 0 in &Capri; about the yeare 15120, at which time his di&s;tance from the Pole &s;hall be 47 degrees 30 minutes. And whereas <HI>Petrus Nonius</HI> &s;ayth, that in times pa&s;t he hath been 12 degrees 24 minutes from the Pole, and is now 3 degrees 30 minutes, happily he meaneth from the creation of the world.</P>
<P>This Pole-Starre in our age is found to culminate with the 6 degr. 20 min. of &Aries;, and to be 88 degr. 24 min. declining North from the equinoctiall: on which 6 degr. 20 min. of &Aries; if you lay the Noone-line, you &s;hall fir&s;t thereby &s;ee what
<PB REF="15"> Starres do continually culminate or come vnto the Meri|dian with it, and you &s;hall finde it to cut on the faire Starre of the third light, in the pummell of the chayer of <HI>Ca&s;&s;iopeia,</HI> and another of the &s;ame light the northermo&s;t of the girdle of <HI>Andromeda,</HI> and in the oppo&s;ite part, <HI>vz.</HI> by the North line, you &s;hall &s;ee the 60 degr. 20 min of &Libra; to culminate almo&s;t with the innermo&s;t of the three in the tayle tayle of <HI>Vr&s;a ma|ior</HI> called <HI>Alioth,</HI> and two of the Starres of &Virgo;, But that of <HI>Ca&s;&s;iopeia,</HI> and that of <HI>Vr&s;a maior</HI> are be&s;t for this purpo&s;e.

<P>_THe Latitude of any place, is the di&s;taunce of his Verticall point from the <HI>Aequinoctiall,</HI> counted by the degrees of his Meridian circle on the South part, and is alwayes equall to the eleuacion of the Pole of the world aboue the <HI>Horizon</HI> counted in the &s;ame <HI>Meridian</HI> on the North part, either of which can neuer exceede 90 degrees: for which cau&s;e, there are in the <HI>Zenitfer</HI> 90 Zenith lines de&s;cribed, to &s;erue euery turne. And the reddie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ure way to get the latitude in any &s;trange place, hauing by the la&s;t Cap. &s;etled your Meridian, is to take the Meridian altitudes of &s;ome one North Starre that neuer commeth South of the Zenith there, both aboue and vnder the Pole, then take the greater Altitude out of the le&s;&s;er, and of the remaine adde the one halfe to the le&s;&s;er, &s;o haue you the latitude or Poles Eleuauion &s;ought, who&s;e complement is the Equinoctials eleuacion aboue the South point of the <HI>Horizon.</HI></P>
<P>For example, admit the fir&s;t Starre of the tayle of <HI>Vr&s;a maior</HI> called <HI>Alioth,</HI> if you ob&s;erue his comming to the <HI>Me|ridian</HI> aboue the Pole-Starre, and there finde his altitude to be 84 degrees high, and afterwards finding him againe in the <HI>Meridian</HI> vnder the Pole (which will be &s;ome 12 houres betweene) and there but 19 &frac13; degrees high, then take 19 &frac13; out of 84 there re&s;teth 64 &frac23;, halfe that being 32 &frac13; added to 19 &frac13; maketh 51 &frac23; our eleuacion heere at <HI>Reading,</HI> and &s;o much is our Zenith, or Verticall point, all is one, di&s;tant from the Equinoctiall, and that 51 &frac23; taken out of 90, leaueth the complement 38 &frac13; the Equinoctials height aboue the Horizon in our Meridian.</P>

Now when you de|&s;ire to knowe the houre of the day or night, you &s;hall as in the la&s;t Cap. is mentioned, either by a Quadrant, or this A&s;tro|labe, take the Altitude of the Sunne at any time in the day or in the night of any Starre.

<PB REF="29"> as he is at in the Noone line, and &s;o will the Ea&s;t and We&s;t points of the houre-circle change their places for the time: The other way generall to all foure remooues of the Zenith|fer.

<P>And whereas for diuers latitudes, &s;ome of the domifying rootes do go out of the Zenitfer, tho&s;e may ea&s;ily be &s;upplyed with help of a threed and pearle added to the pointer, or with helpe of a paire of compa&s;&s;es thus: Fir&s;t, ca&s;t away 45 out of your radiall number &s;hewed by the &s;lope line (<HI>vz. out of the</HI> 57 &frac23; <HI>ca&s;ting</HI> 45, <HI>there remaineth</HI> 12 &frac23;) and &s;et y^e Cur&s;or vnto twi&s;e &s;o many of the domifying rootes of the noonelines &s;cale as the remaine commeth vnto, (<HI>vz. vnto the</HI> 25 &frac23; <HI>domifying roote</HI>) and there apply the pointer vnto the like number of the domifying radiall degrees of the North line (<HI>vz. vnto</HI> 25 &frac13; <HI>degr. reckoned on the North line from the equinoctials inter|&s;ection towards the centre</HI>) and then the Cur&s;or remayning, do apply the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer euen with the fiduciall noone-line of y^e Zenitfer outwards, there doth y^e poin|ters Apex &s;hew y^e true place of y^e roote wanting, where if you pitch one foote of your compa&s;&s;e, or fa&s;ten a threed, and with the other or with the pearle extended to the domifying ra|dyall degree of the &s;lope line, (<HI>vz. vnto the</HI> 57 &frac23; <HI>radiall domi|fying degree,</HI>) offer to de&s;cribe a circle, it &s;hall cut the-clip|ticke as before the pointer did at 22 degrees of &Pisces; and of &Virgo;, &s;o the noone-line &s;tand at his due place as before, <HI>vz.</HI> at 30 or 60 degrees of the Cele&s;tialls limbe from the fir&s;t con&s;ti|tution.</P>

And now by helpe of this latitude thus gotten, you may as ea&s;ily get the true places of the Starres &s;eene in any other place as well as in the Meridian perpetually, for that their latitudes neuer alter, and of &Saturn;, &Jupit;, or &Mars;, 20 or 30 dayes af|ter: for that theirs altereth little in that time, and of &Venus; for a day or two after, but not for the &Moon;, becau&s;e her latitude chan|geth &s;wiftly, neither for &Merc;, becau&s;e in our Clymat we neuer &s;ee him: In this maner.</P>
<P>Take the altitude of any Starre, Planet, or Comet, who&s;e latitude is foreknowne either by this Cap. or otherwi&s;e at any houre and minute knowne, taking good heede whether he be in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Hemi&s;pheare. Then prepare the Zenitfer to that altitude taken, then labell the houre and minute to the &Sun;, and there hold fa&s;t the Zenitfer. Which done, apply the pointer to the circle of latitude of the Starre or Planet either in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Hemicicle, according as the Starre or Planet was at taking his altitude, &s;o &s;hall the circle of longitude pa&s;&s;ing by the pointer &s;o applyed, &s;hew the longitude of the Starre or Planet in the-clipticke.</P>
<P>Note, that <HI>Io. Stophlerus lib.</HI> 2. <HI>prop.</HI> 38. reciteth 7 propo|&s;itions which &s;ome lying A&s;tronomers (as he tearmeth them) haue taken vpon them to teach on the A&s;trolabe, which he there condemneth to be mo&s;t fal&s;e, and not po&s;&s;ible, and there|fore
<PB REF="33"> &s;pendeth a Chapter to forewarne euery man to take heede and not to meddle with them. And the&s;e are the 7, the fir&s;t, to knowe the longitude of the &Moon;, the &s;econd, the longi|tude of &Saturn;, &Jupit;, &Mars;, &Venus;, or &Merc;, the third, to get their latitudes, the fourth, to know whether a Planet be direct or retrograde, the fift, to know the longitude of any Starre in the Reete, the &s;ixt, the latitude of fixed Starres, the &s;euenth, the longi|tude of Starres not in the Reete. And now I am to rewarne all men, that they are all po&s;&s;ible by this A&s;trolabe, and by my Iewell al&s;o, and the whole 7 &s;auing the 4, are performed by this one Chapter: becau&s;e I would not haue them now daunted with that 38 <HI>propo&s;.</HI> of <HI>Stophler</HI> who meant it no doubt only, by that A&s;trolabe whereof him&s;elfe wrote.</P>

<HEAD>Cap. 32. &para; A ready way by helpe of this A&s;trolabe, heereafter to ob&s;erue the motions of Comets.</HEAD>
<P>_BEcau&s;e I haue &s;eene &s;ome 4 or fiue yeares pa&s;t a booke entituled <HI>Noua theoria Cometarum</HI> as I remem|ber, &s;et foorth by one <HI>Re&s;lyn,</HI> who taking occa&s;ion vppon that great Comet or Blazing-Starre, which <HI>Anno</HI> 1570 was &s;eene &s;o long in the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Ca&s;&s;iopeia,</HI> in a manner fixed without motion, to imagining therefore that Comet to happen in the very Pole of the <HI>Theoricke,</HI> and that to be the cau&s;e why he mooued not, thereupon runneth on a cour&s;e, with recitall of diuers Co|mets and their motions, but concluded no certaintie to my remembrance, ending his booke with this &s;aying, <HI>E&s;t quo|dam prodire tenus &s;i non datur vltra.</HI> But our late learned
<PB REF="34"> countreyman, May&s;ter <HI>Digges,</HI> in his <HI>Scala Mathematica</HI> found, becau&s;e he had no Parallax, that he mu&s;t needes be beyond the Speere of the &Moon;. Well no doubt there can not any weighty thing come to perfection at the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third a&s;&s;ay, and therefore to the end it may be a generall care to ob&s;erue the motions of Comets when they happen, I haue thought good to aduerti&s;e euery man in this Cap. that either on this A&s;trolabe or on the Globe, it is a mo&s;t ea&s;y matter when any Planet appeareth, to pricke downe his place euen by the very view of his &s;cituation among the fixed Starres, &s;eeing by the 25 Cap. before you may &s;o ea&s;ily learne to know them all.</P>
<P>As for example in Iuly this yeare 1596 there appeared a Comet with a &s;treaming tayle vpwards in the North-we&s;t, which vpon Tew&s;day the 20 of Iuly afore&s;ayd, about 9 of the clocke at night, I fir&s;t tooke heede of betweene the two hin|der legs of <HI>Vr&s;a maior</HI> almo&s;t in a &s;treight line, (but &s;ome|what lower, and two parts of the way) between the Starre of the fourth light in the neere hocke of the neere hinder legge, and the two Starres of the third light in the further foote behinde, according whereunto I made a pricke in the Cele&s;tiall of this A&s;trolabe. The 21 of Iuly the &s;ame houre, I &s;awe him directly in the &s;treight line afore&s;ayde, and di&s;tant from the &s;ayd two Starres twi&s;e their di&s;tance. The 22 day the &s;ame houre I &s;awe him a little aboue the &s;treight line, and but their di&s;tance off. The 23 of Iuly the night was darke. The 24 of Iuly I &s;awe him aboue tho&s;e two Starres of the third light, and to make an equilater triangle with them: all which, I noted downe euery night with pricks, then followed a fewe clowdy and darke nights, and after that 24 day he was no more &s;eene. This Comet was &s;eene of many others &s;ome fortnight before I &s;awe him, as neere as I could ge&s;&s;e by their relacion euen about the bri&s;ket of <HI>Vr&s;a maior,</HI> a little behinde the hocke of the neere legge afore, which al&s;o I pricked downe: and haue cau&s;ed
<PB REF="34"> tho&s;e pricks and the trayle of his gate to be grauen in the Cele&s;tiall, in the Con&s;tellacion of <HI>Vr&s;a maior</HI> if you marke it, (though not done fully to my purpo&s;e) to the end to incite others heereafter to do the like, that po&s;terity at the la&s;t may finde out whether there be any regularity in their motions. If the Comet chaunce to come to the Meridian either in the North or South (as this did not in &s;ight) then by the la&s;t Cap. you may get his longitude &amp; latitude euery night, and &s;o pricke downe euery dayes motion the more exactly.</P>
