<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAving received a more full account of the pro|ceedings of the <HI>Jews,</HI> I &s;hall here pre&s;ent you with &s;uch <HI>Occurrences,</HI> in this juncture of time, wherein &s;carce any thing el&s;e, is either talkt of, or lookt after, in compari&s;on of them. The whole World we &s;ee is out of order, nothing to be expected but Inte&s;tine Broils, and whether the Lord will be plea&s;ed in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Combu&s;tions to call in his Antient People, and magnifie his Name in them, He onely knoweth. On the 23 of <HI>October,</HI> by the foulne&s;&s;e of the weather and &s;torms, put into <HI>Aberdeen</HI> a Ship, from whence &s;he came, 'tis uncertain; but the Profe&s;&s;our of that City, of the Tongues and Languages, having Notice thereof, went down unto them, and by their Di&s;|cour&s;e perceived they &s;poke broken <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and bound for <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> as was intimated by a Letter in <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> to have Cor|re&s;pondence with their Brethren (the <HI>Jews</HI>) there: Which Letter further relates, That there is Sixteen hundred thou&s;and of them together in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and that there came into <HI>Europe</HI> Six|ty Thou&s;and more; withall, that they have had many Encoun|ters with the <HI>Turks,</HI> defeating &s;everal Bodies, and killing many Thou&s;ands, none being able to &s;tand again&s;t them. They give Liberty of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> to all, except the <HI>Turks,</HI> endeavouring the utter Ruine and Extirpation of them. But for the &s;hip, the Sails thereof are white branched Sattin, and all their Ropes are Silk of the &s;ame Colour; and in the Sails was this In&s;cription in fair Red Characters,</P>
<Q>The&s;e are of the Ten Tribes of I&s;rael.</Q>
<P>Which was to di&s;cover them to be <HI>Jews:</HI> Their Food on board was onely Rice and Honey: Their Habit [or Cloathing] Black

It &s;eem&s; they have &s;ent to mo&s;t of the chief Cities in the World to their Brethren, to give them Notice of their Proceedings, to the end they may come and joyn with them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my la&s;t of the Proceedings of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> We have had Expre&s;&s;es not onely from <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> but <HI>Tunnis</HI> al&s;o; That this Year no Carrivan is to go to <HI>Mecha,</HI> by rea&s;on the City is be&s;ieged by the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who appear in great Numbers, and are &s;aid to be &s;ent by the Ten Tribes to be the Fore-runners:</P>
<P>From <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> we have received very good News, and likewi&s;e many of our Chri&s;tian Merchants have received the like from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> The Particulars of which is, that the Ba&s;haw of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> made u&s;e of a Carravan, that is, an Army of Sixty Thou&s;and Men, and marched toward <HI>Mecha,</HI> and being within one days Iourney of the Ci|tie, &s;ent out a Troop to take notice how things were, which Troop having &s;een this People lying in Tents about the Citie, and hearing that they profe&s;t them|&s;elves to be <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> reported this to the Ba&s;haw who for all that re&s;olved to march on with his Forces and coming within &s;ight of the City, di&s;covered an innu|merable Multitude of People coming out of their
<PB N="3" REF="3"> Tents. Whereupon the Turks advanced up again&s;t them, gave fire, &amp; di&s;charged &s;everal Volleys of round &s;hot; but after a little fighting a pannick fear took them and terror &s;eized on them, making them cry out <HI>Who is able to fight with the&s;e People, &s;eeing our Arrows and Shot return back upon our &s;elves.</HI> So the Turks lea|ving off fighting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">eturned Home, and the I&s;raelites into their Tents without pur&s;uing them. This Af|front cau&s;ed the Ba&s;haw and King of the Moors, tho|row-out all Egypt and Arabia, to impo&s;e on the Iews in all their Dominions a new Tax five times greater then it was before. And the Ba&s;haw, the better to in|form him&s;elf what this People were &s;ent ten Iews to them who found them to be I&s;raelites, and that they &s;pake <HI>Hebrew,</HI> &s;aying, they were &s;ent before to remain at <HI>Meka</HI> till the re&s;t of their Brethren came, for that the time was now come, that they &s;hould return unto their own Land of their Fore-Fathers, which others had u&s;urped and taken from them. Another Letter &s;aith, that the Commander of <HI>Meka</HI> &s;ent <HI>4</HI> Troops to oppo&s;e them, but not one returned and that divers Ca|ravans and great Bodies have bin wholly defeated by the &s;aid <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> and that twelve thou&s;and Turks coming from a City called <HI>Metai,</HI> near <HI>Meka</HI> were al&s;o routed, and eight thou&s;and &s;lain upon the Place, their own Swords and Muskets turning again&s;t them&s;elves. Of the ten Iews that were &s;ent, &s;ix re|mained with their Brethren, and but <HI>4</HI> returned to the Turks. As for the great Prophet in <HI>North-Skilton,</HI> Doctor <HI>Collone&s;t</HI> hath bin at his Hou&s;e in a Town called <HI>Long-Ditch,</HI> where he heard the&s;e things out of his own Mouth. That in the Year <HI>1661.</HI> he medita|ted on the Scriptures &s;peaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">e <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ter Times;</HI>

<P>They have already po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of &s;everal Pla|ces and Cities, putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword, the <HI>Jews</HI> onely excepted. They are a People of a middle &s;tature, their Bodies comely, their Complexions fair: This Party &s;aw no Woman among&s;t them, nor any other Arms, be&s;ides tho&s;e above-mentioned; their Hor&s;es are many, their Attire blew, and their <HI>Tents</HI> black. From the afore&s;aid City of <HI>Sus,</HI> the whole Ho&s;t of them might be plainly and di&s;tinctly viewed the whole Week, and might &s;ee their Fires and Smoak a&s;cending; but on the Sabbath, neither of both could be di&s;cerned throughout the whole Camp, or Ho&s;t.</P>
