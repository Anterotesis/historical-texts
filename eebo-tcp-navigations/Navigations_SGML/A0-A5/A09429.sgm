<HEAD>&para;TO THE RIGHT HO|norable, my singular good May|ster, Sir Christopher Hatto~, Knight, Capitaine of the Queenes Maiesties Garde, Vizchamberlaine to hir Highnesse, and one of hir Maiesties moste honourable priuie Counsayle.</HEAD>
<P>RIGHT honorable, when I first entended the voyage of Discouerie wyth Mr. <HI>Frobisher,</HI> for the finding of the passage to <HI>Cataya</HI> (beyng a matter in oure age aboue all other, notable) I applyed my selfe wholy to the scie~ce of Cosmographie, &amp; sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets of Nauigation, to the ende, I mighte enable my s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the better for the seruice of my Countrie, not onely to vn|derstande what I read and hearde others speake, but also to execute in effect, and practise with my owne hands, the du|tie and office appertayning to a Marriner: and so thereby be better able to make a true reporte of all occurrents in the same voyage. And for that now the common reporte ther|of is so vaine and vncertaine, bycause some men rather con|tendyng what they are able to say, than considering what in truth they should and ought to say, whereby, by sundrie mens fantasies, sundry vntruths are spred abroad, to the gret slaunder of this so honest and honorable an action: I haue
<PB REF="4">
thought good to lay open to your honourable iudgement, the plain truth, and ful discourse of the whole seruice, which I haue taken vpon me (though altogither vnable) to write, and to dedicate vnto your Honor especi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly, for these spe|ciall causes following Firste, the world doth witnesse, and I my selfe by good proofe haue tasted &amp; fou~d (being a ma~ by your Honorable goodnesse and good cou~tenance, specially supported, and euen (as it were) the handy worke of youre owne hands) how honorable a regard you beare to Vertue, howe readye to countenaunce the meanest man that truely serueth his Countrie, howe willing to giue vnto suche both grace and opinion with hir Maiestie, howe ready to procure rewarde there, for those that shall iustlye merite the same. And therewithall, considering the sounde iudgement you haue to discern, as wel in this, as in al other causes of waight: And knowing wel, what place you hold with hir highnesse, (who, for the faithfull seruice you dayly doe hir, as well in Courte, as common Weale, whyche nowe by the true tuch|stone of time, and long experience, shee hath founde, and therefore confirmeth a faste and sure opinion in you wyth the chiefest) I haue specially thoughte it necessarye, besides my dutie (whiche aboue all the worlde my alleageaunce re|serued, I owe you moste) for these respects to make relation of this seruice vnto your Honoure aboue others. And for that this action, both for the worthinesse of the attempt, for the good and quiet gouernment, for the greate and maruel|lous daungers, for the straunge and vnknowne accidents of the vnknowne corners of the worlde, aboue all others, may appeare moste notable and famous: I haue bene the rather desirous to take some paine therein, and what I haue aship-boorde rudely and vnorderly framed or obserued, to com|mend to youre Honourable construction the same: being willing rather to hazarde mine own shame, by shewing my selfe an insufficient writer (whiche perchaunce maye s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eme somewhat besides my profession) than that so honest and
<PB REF="4">
worthy attemptes of our owne nation, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the example of so well a gouerned seruice, should ly hidden from your Ho|nours sight. And for that I wil be iniurious to no man, whi|che in this action hath borne place, and well discharged the same, and that those men with the maner of their dayly pro|ceedings there, by name maye be knowne vnto you, I haue in their place remembred them in order as becommeth: and haue not onely named each principall, but euerye priuate person (if by any speciall seruice hee hath merited the same) to the ende, that the well deseruing man, receiuing the due commendation of his deserte, maye bee encouraged to con|tinue, and take pleasure in well dooyng after, and others be|ing animated by like example, maye for hope of lyke re|warde also, desire to deserue well.</P>
<P>By this Discourse, it may please your Honour to behold the greate industrie of oure present age, and the inuincible mindes of oure Englishe nation, who haue neuer lefte anye worthy thing vnattempted, nor anye parte almoste of the whole worlde vnsearched, whome lately, neither stormes of Seas by long and tedious voyages, daunger of darke fogs and hidden rockes in vnknowne coastes, congealed and fro|sen Seas, with mountaines of fleeting Ise, nor yet presente death dayly before their face, coulde anye whit dismaye, or cause to desiste from intended enterpises: but rather pre|ferring an honourable death beefore a shamefull retourne, haue (notwithstanding the former daungers, (after manye perillous repulses) recouered their desired Porte. So that, if nowe the passage to CATAYA thereby be made open vn|to vs, (which only matter hitherto hath occupied the finest heades of the worlde, and promiseth vs a more riches by a nearer way than either <HI>Spaine</HI> or <HI>Portugale</HI> possesseth) where|of the hope (by the good industrie and greate attemptes of these men is greatelye augmented) or if the Golde Ore in these new Discoueries founde oute, doe in goodnesse, as in great plentie aunswere expectation, and the successe do
<PB REF="5">
folow as good, as the proofe thereof hitherto made, is great, wee may truely inferre, that the Englishman in these our dayes, in his discoueries, to the Spaniarde and Portingale is nothing inferior: and for his hard aduentures, and valiant re|solutions, greatly superior. For what hath the Spaniarde or Portingale done by the Southeast and Southweast, that the Englishman by the Northeast and Northweaste hath not counteruailed the same?</P>
<P>And albeit I confesse that the Englishe haue not hy|therto had so ful successe of profit and commoditie of plea|saunt place (considering that the former nations haue hap|pily chanced to trauel by more temperate clymates, where they had not onlye good meates and drinkes, but all other things necessarie, for the vse of man) all whiche things, the English, trauelling by more inte~perate places, &amp; as it were with mayne force, making waye thorowe seas of Ise, haue wa~ted, which notwithstanding, argueth a more resolution; for <HI>Difficiliora pulchriora,</HI> that is, the adue~ture the more hard the more honorable: yet concerning the perfecter know|ledge of the world, and Geographicall description, (wherin the present age and posteritie also, by a more vniuersal vn|dersta~ding is much furthered, as appeareth by my vniuer|sall Mappe with pricked boundes here annexed) herein, the Englishman deserueth chiefe honor aboue any other. For neyther <HI>Spaniard</HI> nor <HI>Portugale,</HI> nor anye other besides the English, haue bin found by so great daungers of Ise, so neare the Pole, to aduenture any discouerie, wherby the obscure and vnknowen partes of the world (which otherwise had laine hid) haue bin made knowen vnto vs.</P>
<P>So that it may appeare, that by oure Englishmens indu|stries, and these late voyages, the world is grown to a more fulnesse and perfection: many vnknowen lands and Ilands, (not so much as thought vpon before) made knowen vnto vs: Christs name spred: the Gospell preached: Infidels like to be conuerted to Christianitie, in places where before the
<PB REF="5">
name of God hath not once bin hearde of: Shipping and Seafaring me~, haue ben employed: nauigation and the Na|uie, (which is the chief strength of our Realm) maintayned: and Gentlemen in the Sea seruice, for the better seruice of their Country wel experienced. Al whiche things, are (no doubt) of so gret importa~ce, as being wel wayed, may seeme to counteruayle the aduentures charges: although the pas|sage to CATAYA were not found out, neither yet the golde ore proue good, wher of both, the hope is good &amp; gret. But notwithstanding all these, euen in this (if no otherwise) hyr most excellent Maiestie hath reaped no small profit, that she may now stand assured, to haue many more tried, able, &amp; sufficient men against time of need, that are, (which with out vau~t may be spoken) of valour gret, for any great adue~|ture, &amp; of gouerneme~t good for any good place of seruice. For this may truly be spoken of these men, that there hath not bin seene in any nation, being so many in nu~ber, &amp; so far fro~ home, more ciuill order, better gouernement or agree|ment. For euen from the beginning of the seruice hitherto, there hath neither passed mutinie, quarrel, or notorious fact, either to the slaunder of the men, or daunger of the voyage, although the Gentlemen, Souldiors, and Marriners (whiche seldome can agree) were by companies matched togither.</P>
<P>But I may perchaunce (right Honourable) seeme to dis|course somewhat too largely, especially in a cause that (as a partie) somewhat concerneth my selfe: which I doe, not for that I doubt of your Honorable opinion already conceiued of the men, but for that I knowe, the ignorant multitude is rather ready to slaunder, than to giue good encouragement by due commendation to good causes, who, respecting no|thing but a present gaine, and being more than needefully suspitious of the matter, do therwithall condemne the men, and that without any further respect, either of their honest intents, either of their wel performing the matter they dyd vndertake (whiche according to their direction, was speci|cially
<PB REF="6">
to bring home Ore) either else of their painful trauel (whiche for their Prince, and the publike profite of their Countries cause they haue sustained.)</P>
<P>But by the way, it is not vnknown to the world, that this our natiue country of England, in al ages hath bred vp (and specially at this present abou~deth with) many forward and valia~t minds, fit to take in ha~d any notable enterprise: wher by appeareth, that if the Englishman had bin in times paste as fortunate and foreseeing to accept occasion offered, as he hath bin alwayes forwarde in executing anye cause once ta|ken in hand: he had bin worthily preferred before all nati|ons of the worlde, and the Weast <HI>Indies</HI> had now bin in the possession of the Englishe.</P>
<P>For <HI>Columbus,</HI> the firste Discouerer of the Weaste <HI>Indies,</HI> made firste offer thereof, with his seruice, to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seauenth, then Kyng of Englande, and was not accepted: Wherevppon, for want of entertainement here, hee was forced to go into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and offred there (as before) the same to <HI>Ferdinando</HI> Kyng of <HI>Castyle,</HI> who presently acceptyng the occasion, did first himselfe, and now his successors, enioy the benefite thereof.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Sebastian Cabota,</HI> being an Englishman, and borne in <HI>Bristowe,</HI> after he had discouered sundrie parts of new found lande, and attempted the passage to CATAYA by the Northweast, for the King of England, for lacke of entertain|ment here, (notwithstanding his good desert) was forced to seeke to the Kyng of <HI>Spaine,</HI> to whose vse hee discouered all that tract of <HI>Brasile,</HI> &amp; aboute the famous riuer <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> and for the same, and other good seruices there, was after|wardes renowmed, by title of <HI>Piloto Maggiore,</HI> that is, Graund Pylote, and constituted chiefe officer of the Contractation house of <HI>Siuilla</HI>: in whiche house, are handled all matters concerning the Weast <HI>Indies,</HI> and the reuenues therof: and further, that no Pylot shoulde be admitted for any discoue|rie, but by his direction.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">But there hath bin two speciall causes in former age, that haue greatly hindered the English nation in their attempts. The one hath bin, lacke of liberalitie in the Nobilitie, &amp; the other wa~t of skill in Cosmographie, and the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of Nauiga|tion. Whiche kinde of knowledge, is verye necessary for all our noble men, for that wee being Ilanders, oure chiefest strength consisteth by Sea. But these twoo causes are nowe in this present age (God be thanked) verye well reformed: for not only hir maiestie now, but all the nobilitie also, ha|uing perfect knowledge in Cosmographie, doe not onely with good wordes, countenaunce the forward mindes of men, but also with their purses do liberally and bountifully contribute vnto the same, whereby it commeth to passe, that Nauigation, whiche in the time of King Henrie the .7. was very rawe, &amp; toke (as it were) but beginning (and euer since hath had by little and little continuall increase) is now in hir Maiesties raigne, growen to his highest perfection.</P>
<P>Thus right Honorable, as I haue in these my first trauels in these late voyages, vppon such occasions as passed there nowe, rendered your honour this bare and true accompte: So being further resolued to offer my self a continual sacri|fice with the first, for hir Maiestie and my country, in thys or any other like seruice, I intend (God willing) according to this beginning, if any thing hereafter fall out worth the memorie, to present your honoure therewithall, and from time to time, to aduertise you of euery particular. And in all these things which I deliuer now, or shal hereafter ad|uertise, I humbly praye, your honour woulde vouchsafe to giue some credite therevnto, and rather to thinke, I may be deceiued, than that I meane to deceiue, colour, or conceale any thing: for I neither can, nor wil, vse any flourish in the matter, but a bare truth in all: And therevpon I giue my poore credite vnto your honour in pawnne. And herein I humbly pray pardon, for my rude order of writing, which proceedeth from the barren brayne of a souldiour and one
<PB REF="7">
professing armes, who desireth rather to be wel thought of with your honour, for his well meaning, than for anye hys cunning writing at all.</P>
<P>And thus, hauing presumed to present these vnt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mely and vnripe fruites to your honoures beste and fauourable construction, I humbly take my leaue, beseeching God to blesse you, as I do faithfully serue, and will honor you euer.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRINTER to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as (ge~tle Reader) these three voyages lately by our Countreymen perfor|med, do both for the matter of discouerie, for the strange and vnknovven accidentes, for the rare and hard aduentures, and also for the good and discrete order of gouernement, appeare aboue all others most notable and fa|mous: I haue bin especially desirous, by all meanes possible I could, to procure the pub|lication thereof, thinking it too great an iniu|rie to our common vvealth, to burie in obliui|on so vvorthy attemptes of our ovvne nation, and to hide the ensample of so good and so vvell a gouerned seruice. And for that (as I vndersta~d) many trifling Pamphlets haue bin secretly thrust out, not only vvithout the con|sent of the Captaynes and executioners of the same, but also rather to the greate disgrace of the vvorthy voyage, than othervvise, I hauing intelligence of a substantiall discourse vvhiche vvas diligently vvritten thereof, and priuately dedicated to my very Honourable Mayster, Sir Christopher Hatton Knight, by a Gentle|man
<PB REF="8">
of his ovvne, vvho vvas personally present a Captain in all the same seruice, I haue, vvith|out first making priuie the Authour, procured his Coppie out of the handes of a friende of mine, vvho had the vvriting and perusing ther|of, and haue presumed to publish and imprint the same, to the ende that thereby I mighte (gentle Reader) as vvell satisfye thy greedy ex|pectation, by vnfolding these nevve and vn|knovven matters, vvhereof the nature of man is most desirous, as also to performe that due|tie vvhiche I ovve vnto my sayde Honourable Mayster, in publishing such things as are dire|cted vnto him. And for that the mater is vvor|thy to passe vnder the protection of his ho|nourable name, I haue heerein bin vvilling, ra|ther to beare the burthen of the Authoures priuate displeasure, if therevvith he shoulde af|tervvards be offended, than not by publishing that same, seeme not only to do a publike iniu|rie vnto my natiue Countrey, but also shevv a lighte regarde of my duetie, in obscuring the doyngs and trauels of him, or anye of his, vvhose honour (as I am chiefely bou~d) I te~der more than my ovvne safetie. And albeit I haue in a fevve p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aces somevvhat altered from my Coppie, and vvronged therby the Authoure,
<PB REF="8">
and haue sought to conceale vpon good cau|ses some secretes, not fitte to be published or reuealed to the vvorld (as the degrees of Lon|gitude and Latitude, the distance, and true position of places, and the variation of the compasse,) &amp;c vvhiche neuerthelesse, by a ge|nerall, and particular Mappe concerning the same, heerevnto annexed, is so sufficiently ex|planed, that easilie any thing apperteyning vnto the voyage, or in this discourse mentio|ned, may sensibly be vnderstode: And though the matter be entirelie the Authours ovvne, yet am I contented (for thy sake) rather than the same shoulde not be published, to beare the burthe~ of blame, and to abide the reprofe of the faultes escaped, taking vpon me that re|proche of presumption, and hazarding my name to the vvorld, al vvhich things the Author peraduenture taketh for so great disgraces, as vvillingly he vvould not adue~ture in his ovvne name the publishing thereof. But specially, for that the commendation of a Historie consi|steth in truth and playnenesse, I haue desired to bring forth, &amp; prefer (before other Pamph|lets) the same, knovving that the Authoure thereof, in nothing more than in truth, desireth to maynteyne credite vvith this honourable

personage, vnto vvhome vvith his ovvne hand vvritten, he hath priuately dedicated the same, as by the Epistle Dedicatorie may appeare. If therefore thou shalte accept my vvell mea|ning in good parte, and yeelde but deserued prayse to the Authoure for doing, and thankes to me for publishing the same, it shall suffice to make me thinke my trauell vvell therein employed.

But to drawe n&eacute;ere to my purposed scope, that is, to discourse of inuentions by way of discoueries, I say, that one of the excellentest artes that euer hath bin de|uised, is the Arte of Nauigation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nauigation.</NOTE> which in times past was so raw, and vnknowen, that no man durst trauell by Sea, sauing only alongst the shore: and if by wind, currant or te~|pest, he were driuen, against his will, so far fro~ the land, y^t he lost the sight thereof, he made no other accompte, but to be cast away, his vessell was so rude, and his skill so little.</P>

And as for gold, siluer, and al other kinde of Metals, al kind of spices, and delectable fruites, both for delicacie, &amp; health, are there in such aboundance, as hitherto they haue bene thought to haue bene bred no where else, but there. And in conclusion, it is now thought, that no where else but vnder the Equinoctiall, or not farre from thence, is the earthlye Paradise, and the only place of perfection in this world. And that the things may s&eacute;eme the lesse straunge, bycause i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath bin accompted of the old Philosophers, that there could no|thing prosper, for the extreme heate of the Sunne continu|ally going ouer their heades in the Zodiacke, I thoughte good here to alleage suche naturall causes as to m&eacute;e s&eacute;eme verie substanciall and sure reasons. First you are to vnder|stande, that the Sunne doeth worke his more or lesse heate in these lower parts by two meanes, the one is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the kind of Angle that the Sun beames doeth make with the earth, as in all <HI>Torrida Zona,</HI> it maketh perpendicularly righte An|gles, in some place or other at noone, and towardes the two Poles verie oblique and vneuen Angles. And the other meane is the longer or shorter continuaunce of the Sunne aboue the Horizon. So that wheresoeuer these two causes do most concurre, there is moste excesse of heate: and when the one is wanting, the rigor of the heat is lesse. For though the Sunne beames do beate perpendicularly vpon any re|gion subiect vnto it, if it hath no continuaunce or abode a|boue the Horizon, to worke his operation in, there can no hote effect proc&eacute;ede. For nothing can be don in a momente. And this seconde cause, <HI>mora solis supra Horizontem,</HI> the time of the Sunnes abiding aboue the Horizon, the old Philoso|phers
<PB N="23" REF="21">
neuer reme~bred, but regarded only the manner of an|gles, y^t the Sun beames made with the Horizon, which if they were equall and right, the heate was the greater, as in <HI>Torrida Zona:</HI> if they were vnequall &amp; oblique, the heat was the lesse, as towardes both poles, which reason is very good &amp; substancial: for the perpendicular beames reflect and re|uerberate in themselues, so that the heate is doubled, euery beame striking twice, &amp; by vniting are multiplied, and con|tinue strong in forme of a Columne. But in our latitude of 50. &amp; .60. degr&eacute;es, the Sun beams descend oblique &amp; slanting wise, &amp; so sthiketh but once &amp; departeth, and therefore oure heate is the lesse, for any effect that the angle of the Suns beames make. Yet, because we haue a longer continuaunce of the Sunnes presence aboue our Horizon than they haue vnder the Equinoctiall, by whiche continuaunce the heate is increased, for it shineth to vs .xvj. or .xviii. houres some|time, when it continueth with them but twelue houres al|wayes.</P>
<P>And againe, oure night is very shorte, wherein colde va|pors vse to abound, being but .6. or .8. houres long, wheras theirs is alwayes twelue houres long, by which two adua~|tages of long dayes and shorte nights, thoughe we wante the equalitie of Angle, it commeth to passe, that in Sommer oure heate here is as greate as theirs is there, as hath bin proued by experience, and is nothing dissonant from good reason.</P>
<P>Therefore, whosoeuer wil rightly way the force of colde &amp; heate in any region, muste not onelye consider the Angle that the Sunne beames make, but also the continuaunce of the same aboue the Horizon. As firste to them vnder the Equinoctiall the Sunne is twice a yeare at noone in their Zenith perpendicular ouer their heades, &amp; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">re during the .ij. houres of those two dayes the heat is very vrgent, &amp; so perhaps it will be in .4. or .5. dayes more, an houre euerye

daye vntill the Sunne in his proper motion, haue crossed the Equinoctiall, so that this extreame heate caused by the perpendicular Angle of the Sunne beames, endureth but two houres of two dayes, in a yeare. But if anye man say the Sunne maye s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alde a good while, before and after it come to the Meridian, so farre forthe as reason leadeth, I am content to allowe it, and therefore I will measure and proportion the Sunnes heate, by comparing the Angles there, with the Angles made here in England, bicause this te~perature is best knowen vnto vs. As for example, the .11. daye of Marche, when vnder the Equinoctiall it is halfe an houre paste eight of the clocke in the morning, the Sunne will be in the East, bycause there it ariseth alwayes at six of the clocke, and moueth euerye houre 15. degrees aboue y^e Horizon, and so high verye neare wil it be with vs at <HI>Lon|don</HI> the saide .11. of March at noone. And therfore looke what force the Sunne hath with vs at noone, the .11. of March, the same force hath it vnder the Equinoctiall at halfe houre paste eight in the morning, or rather lesse force vnder the Equinoctiall. For with vs the Sunne hadde b&eacute;ene alrea|dye six
y houres aboue the Horizon, and so had purified and clensed all the vapours, and thereby hys force encreased at noone, but vnder the Equinoctiall, the Sunne hauing b&eacute;en vppe but<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 2&frac12; houres hadde sufficient to doe, to purge &amp; con|sume the colde and moyste vapoures of the long night, and as yet had wrought no effect of heate. And therefore I may boldely pronounce, that there is muche lesse heate at halfe houre past eight vnder the Equinoctiall, than is with vs at noone (<HI>a fortiori.</HI>) Butte in Marche, w&eacute;e are not one|lye contented to haue the Sunne shining, but we greate|ly desire the same. Likewise the .11. of Iune, the Sunne in oure Meridian is .62. degr&eacute;es highe at London: and vnder the Equinoctiall it is so high after .10. of the clocke, and s&eacute;e|ing then it is beneficiall with vs <HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> it is beneficial to them after .10. of the clocke.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="22">And thus haue we measured the force of the Suns grea|test heate, the hottest dayes in the yeare, vnder the Equi|noctiall, that is, in March and September, from sixe tyll af|ter tenne of the clocke in the morning, and from two vntill sunne set. And this is concluded, by respecting only the first cause of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te, which is the consideration of the Angle of y^e Sunne beames, by a certaine similitude, that whereas the sunne shineth neuer aboue twelue houres, more than eight of them would be coole and pleasaunt eue~ to vs much more to them that are acquainted alwayes with suche warme places. So there remayneth lesse than foure houres of anye excessiue heate, &amp; that only in the two sommer dayes of the yeare, that is, the eleuenth of March, and the fourt&eacute;enth of September, for vnder the Equinoctiall they haue two som|mers, in March, and September, which are our spring and Autumne: and likewise two winters, in Iune, and Decem|ber, which are our Sommer and Winter, as may well ap|peare to him that hath onelye tasted the principles of the Sphere. But if the sunne be in eyther Tropicke, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or appro|ching neare therevnto, then may we more easilye measure the force of his Meridian altitude, that it striketh vpon the Equinoctial. As for example, the twelfth of Iune, the sunne will be in the first degr&eacute;e of <HI>Cancer.</HI> Then loke what force the heate of the sunne hath vnder the Equinoctiall, y^e same force and greater, it hath in all that Paralel, where the Pole is eleuated betw&eacute;ene 47. and 48. degr&eacute;es. And there|fore <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> the 12. daye of Iulye sustayneth more heate of the Sunne, than <HI>Saint Thomas</HI> Ilande lying n&eacute;ere the same Meridian, doth likewise at noone, or the Ilandes <HI>Taprobana, Moluccae,</HI> or the firme lande of <HI>Peru</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which al lye vnderneath the Equinoctial. For vpon the 12. day of Iune aforesayd, the sunne beames at noone doe make an <HI>Isocheles</HI> Triangle, whose <HI>Vertex</HI> is the Center of the Sunne, the <HI>Basis</HI> a lyne extended from <HI>Saint Thomas</HI> I|lande, vnder the Equinoctiall, vnto <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> neare

the same Meridian: therfore the two Angles of the Base,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Iune is greater heat at <HI>Paris</HI> than vnder the E|quinoctial.</NOTE> muste n&eacute;edes be equall <HI>p. 5. primi, Ergo</HI> the force of the heate equall, if there were no other cause, than the reason of the Angle, as the olde Philosophers haue appointed. But by|cause at <HI>Paris</HI> the Sun riseth two houres before it riseth to them vnder the Equinoctiall, &amp; setteth likewise two houres after the~, by means of the obliquity of the Horizo~, in which time of the Sunnes presence .4. houres in one place, more tha~ the other, it worketh some effect more in the one place than in the other, &amp; being of equall height at noone, it muste then n&eacute;edes follow to be more hote in the Paralell of <HI>Paris,</HI> than it is vnder the Equinoctiall. Also this is an other rea|son, that when the Sun setteth to them vnder the Equino|ctiall, it goeth very d&eacute;ep &amp; lowe vnder their Horizon, almost euen to their <HI>Antipodes,</HI> whereby their twylights are very shorte, and their nightes are made verye extreame darke and long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Twy|lights are shorter, and the nights darker, vnder the Equino|ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al than at <HI>Paris.</HI></NOTE> and so the moysture and coldenesse of the long nightes, wonderfully encreaseth, so that at length the Sun rising, can hardly in many houres consume and driue away the colde humoures and moyst vapours of the nighte paste, which is cleane contrarye in y^e Paralel of <HI>Paris:</HI> For y^e Sun goeth vnder their Horizon but verye little, after a sloping forte, whereby their nights are not verye darke, but light|some, as looking into the North in a cleare night withoute cloudes, it doeth manifestlye appeare, their twilightes are long, for the Paralel <HI>Cancer</HI> cutteth not the Horizon of <HI>Pa|ris</HI> at right angles, (but at angles very vneuen, and vnlike) as it doth the Horizon of the Equinoctiall. Also the Som|mer day at <HI>Paris,</HI> is sixt&eacute;ene houres long, and the nighte but eight: where contrariwise, vnder the Equinoctial, the day is but twelue houres long, and so long is also the nighte, in what soeuer Paralell the Sunbe: and therefore looke what oddes and difference of proportion there is betw&eacute;ene the Sunnes abode aboue the Horizon in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the abode it hath vnder the Equinoctiall, (it being in <HI>Cancer</HI>) the same
<PB N="27" REF="23">
proportion woulde s&eacute;eme to be betw&eacute;en the heate of the one place and heate of the other: for other things (as the angle of the whole acke of the Sunnes progresse that day in both places) are equall.</P>
<P>But vnder the Equinoctiall, the presence and abode of the Sunne aboue the Horizon, is equall to his absence, and abode vnder the Horizon, eache being twelue houres. And at <HI>Paris,</HI> the continuaunce and abode of the Sunne is a|boue the Horizon sixteene houres long, and but eight hours absence, whiche proportion is double, from whiche, if the proportion of the equalitie be subtrahed to find the diffe|rence, there will remaine stil a double proportion, whereby it s&eacute;emeth to followe, that in Iune the heate at <HI>Paris</HI> were double to the heate vnder the Equinoctiall. For (as I haue saide) the angle of the Sunne beames, are in all pointes e|quall, and the cause of difference is, <HI>Mora Solis supra Hori|zontem,</HI> the staye of the Sunne in the one Horizon more than in the other. Therefore, whosoeuer coulde finde out in what proportion the angle of the Sunne beames heateth, and what encrease the Sunnes continuaunce doeth adde therevnto, it might expresly be sette downe, what force of heate and colde is in all regions.</P>
<P>Thus you partely s&eacute;e by comparing a Clymate to vs well knowne, and familiarlye acquainted by lyke height of the Sunne in bothe places, that vnder the Equinoctiall in Iune, is no excessiue heate, but a temperate ayre rather tending to colde.

Also the middle region of the Ayre, where all the Hayle, Frost, and Snowe is engendred, is n&eacute;erer vnto the Sunne than the earth is, and yet there continueth per|petuall colde, bycause there is nothing that the Sunnes beames may reflect against, whereby appeareth the n&eacute;ere|nesse of the body of y^e Sunne worketh nothing. Therfore to returne again to the blacke <HI>Moores,</HI> I my selfe haue s&eacute;ene an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> as blacke as a cole broughte into <HI>Englande,</HI> who taking a faire Englishe woman to Wife, begatte a Sonne in all respectes as blacke as the Father was, al|though <HI>England</HI> were his natiue Countrey, &amp; an English woman his Mother: whereby it s&eacute;emeth this blacknesse proc&eacute;edeth rather of some naturall infection of that man, whiche was so strong, that neyther y^e nature of the Clime, neyther the good complexion of the Mother concurring, coulde any thing alter, and therefore we can not impute it to the nature of y^e Clime. And for a more fresh example, our people of <HI>Meta Incognita</HI> (of whome and for whome thys discourse is taken in hande) that were broughte this last yeare into <HI>Englande,</HI> were all generallie of the same co|loure, that many Nations be, lying in the middest of the middle Zone. And this their couloure was not only in the face whiche was subiecte to Sunne and Ayre, but also in their bodies, which were still couered with garments, as

Degr&eacute;es, for in effect, they are within thr&eacute;e or four degr&eacute;es of that, which they call the frosen Zone, and as I said, for|tie degr&eacute;es from the burning Zone, whereby it foloweth, that there is some other cause than the Clymate, or the Sunnes perpendicular reflection, that shoulde cause the <HI>E|thiopians</HI> great blacknesse. And the most probable cause to my iudgemente is, that this blacknesse proc&eacute;edeth of some naturall infection of the first inhabita~ts of that Countrey, and so all the whole progenie of them descended, are still poluted with the same blot of infection. Therefore it shall not be farre from our purpose, to examine the first originall of these blacke men, and how by lineall discente, they haue hitherto continued thus blacke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the <HI>Ethiopia~s</HI> blackenesse.</NOTE> It manifestly and plainely appeareth by holy Scripture, that after the generall Inun|dation and ouerflowing of the Earth, there remayned no moe me~ aliue, but <HI>Noe</HI> &amp; his thr&eacute;e sonnes, <HI>Sem, Cham,</HI> and <HI>Iaphet,</HI> who only were lefte to possesse &amp; inhabit the whole face of the earth: therefore all the land that vntill this daye hath bin inhabited by sundry discents, must n&eacute;edes come of the ofspring eyther of <HI>Sem, Cham,</HI> or <HI>Iaphet,</HI> as the onely sonnes of <HI>Noe,</HI> who all thr&eacute;e being white, and their wiues also, by course of nature, should haue begotten and brought forth white children.

infection of bloud, &amp; not the distemperature of the clymate, which also may be proued by this example, that these black men are found in all partes of <HI>Africa,</HI> as well withoute the Tropicks, as within, euen vnto <HI>Capo d'buona Speranza</HI> Southward, where, by reason of the Sphere, should be the same temperature as is in <HI>Spayne, Laddigna,</HI> and <HI>Sicilia,</HI> where all be of very good complexions. Wherefore I con|clude, that the blacknesse proc&eacute;edeth not of the hotenesse of the Clime, but as I sayd, of the infection of bloud, and ther|fore this their argumente gathered of the <HI>Africans</HI> black|nesse, is not able to destroy the temperature of the middle Zone. We may therefore very well be assertayned, that vnder the Equinoctiall, is the most pleasant and delectable place of the worlde to dwell in, where, although the Sunne for two houres in a yeare, be directe ouer their heads, and therefore the heate at that time somewhat of force, yet by|cause it commeth so seldome, and continueth so small a time, when it commeth, it is not to be wayed, but rather the moderate heate of other times is all the yeare to be re|membred. And if the heate at any time should in the shorte daye ware somewhat vrgent, the coldnesse of the long night there, would easilie refreshe it, according as <HI>Honte|rus</HI> sayth, speaking of the temperature vnder the Equinoc|tiall.</P>

<P>If the heate of the Sunne in the day time doe burne or parch any thing, the moysture of the nighte dothe coole and refresh the same againe, the Sunne being as long absente in the night, as it was present in the day. Also our Author of the Sphere, <HI>Iohannes d' Sacro bosco,</HI> in the Chapter of the Zodiacke, deriueth the Etimologie of <HI>Zodiacus,</HI> of the Gr&eacute;eke word <HI>Zoe,</HI> whiche in Latin signifyeth <HI>Vita,</HI> life, for
<PB N="33" REF="26">
out of <HI>Aristotle</HI> he alledgeth, that <HI>Secundum accessum &amp; re|cessum solis in Zodiaco, fiunt generationes &amp; corruptiones in rebus inferioribus:</HI> according to the Sunnes going to and fro in the Zodiake, the inferiour bodies take their causes of gene|ration and corruption. Then it foloweth, that where there is most going too and fro, there is most generation and cor|ruption: whiche must n&eacute;edes be betw&eacute;ene the two Tro|pikes, for there the Sunne goeth too and fro most, and no where else, but there. Therefore, betw&eacute;ene the two Tro|pikes, that is, in the midle Zone, is greatest increase, mul|tiplication, generation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Under the Equinoctiall is greatest generation.</NOTE> and corruption of things, which al|so we find by experience, for there is Sommer twice in the yeare, and twice Winter, so that they haue two Haruests in the yeare, and continuall spring. Seing then the middle Zone falleth out so temperate, it resteth to declare where the hotest part of the World should be, for we fynde some places more hote than others. To answere this doubt, rea|son persuadeth, the hotest place in the Worlde to be vnder and about the two Tropickes, for there more than in anye other place doe both the causes of heate concurre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greatest heare vnder the Tropiks.</NOTE> that is, the perpendicular falling of the Sunne beames, at righte Angles, and a greater continuance of the Sunne aboue the Horison (the Pole there being eleuated thr&eacute;e or foure and twentie degr&eacute;es.) And as before I concluded, that though the Sunne were perpendicular to them vnder the Equi|noctiall, yet bycause the same continued but a small tyme, (theyr dayes being short, and theyr nightes long) and theyr sp&eacute;edie departure of the Sunne from their Zenith, bycause of the suddayne crossing of the Zodiake with the Equi|noctiall, and that by such continuall course and recourse of hote and cold, the temperature grew moderate.</P>
<P>So now to the~ vnder y^e two Tropikes, the Sun hauing once by his proper permotio~ declined .20. degr&eacute;es from the Equinoctial, beginneth to draw n&eacute;ere theyr Zenith, which may b&eacute;e (as before, aboute the eleuenth day of May, and
<PB N="34" REF="27">
then beginneth to send his beames almost at right Angles, about which tyme, the Sunne entreth into the first degr&eacute;e of <HI>Gemini,</HI> and with this almost right Angle, the Sunne beames will continue, vntill it be past <HI>Cancer,</HI> that is, the space of two Monethes euery day at noone, almost perpen|dicular ouer their heads, being then the time of <HI>So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stitium Aestiuale,</HI> whiche so long continuance of the Sun aboute their Zenith, maye cause an extreame heate (if anye be in the world) but of necessitie farre more heate, than can b&eacute;e vnder the Equinoctiall, where the Sunne hathe no suche long abode in the Zenith, but passeth away therehence very quickly. Also vnder the Tropikes, the day is longer by an houre and a halfe, than it is vnder the Equinoctiall, wherefore the heate of the Sunne, hauing a longer tyme of operation, must n&eacute;edes be encreased, especially s&eacute;eing the nighte, wherein colde and moysture doe abounde vnder the Tropikes, is lesse than it is vnder the Equinoctiall. Therefore I gather, that vnder the Tropikes is the ho|test place, not onely of <HI>Torrida Zona,</HI> but of any other parte of the Worlde, especially bycause there both causes of heate doe concurre, that is, the perpendicular falling of the Sunne beames two Monethes togyther, and the longer abode of the Sunnes presence aboue the Horison. And by this meanes, more at large is proued, that <HI>Marochus</HI> in Sommer, is farre more hote, than at any tyme vnder the Equinoctiall, bycause it is scituate so n&eacute;ere the Tropike <HI>Cancer,</HI> and also for the length of their dayes. Neyther yet doe I thynke, that the Regions scituate vnder the Tro|pikes, are not habitable, for they are founde to be verye frutefull also, although <HI>Marochus,</HI> and some other partes of <HI>Africa</HI> n&eacute;ere the Tropike, for the drynesse of the natiue sandie soyle, and some accidentes, maye s&eacute;eme to some to be intemperate for ouermuch heate. For <HI>Ferdinandus O|uiedus,</HI> speaking of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cuba Hispaniola.</HI></NOTE> Ilands of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> lying hard vnder, or by the Tropike <HI>Cancer,</HI> sayeth,

<P>Also, they haue most holesome and cl&eacute;ere water, and temperate ayre, by reason whereof, the heards of Beas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es are muche bigger, fatter, and of better tast, then any in <HI>Spayne,</HI> bycause of the rancke pasture, whose moysture is better digested in the hearbe or grasse, by continuall and temperate heate of the Sunne, whereby being made more fatte and vnctious, it is of better and more stedfast nou|rishment. For continuall and temperate heate dothe not only draw much moysture out of the earth, to the nourish|mente of suche things as growe, and are engendred in that Clime, but dothe also by moderation, preserue the same from putrifying, digesting also, and condensating or thick|ning the sayd moyst nourishmente into a gummie and vn|ctious substance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Under the Tropickes is a mode<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nte temperature</NOTE> whereby appeareth also, that vnder the Tropikes is both holesome, frutefull, and pleasant habita|tion, whereby lastly it followeth, that al the middle Zone, whiche vntyll of late dayes hathe bin compted and called the burning, broyling, and parched Zone, is now found to b&eacute;e the most delicate, temperate, commodious, pleasaunte, and delectable part of the World, and especially vnder the Equinoctiall.</P>

<P>THe colde Regions of the Worlde are those, whiche tending towarde the Pole Artike, and Antartike, are without the circuit or bounds of the seauen Climates, which agr&eacute;eable to the o|pinion of the old Writers, is founde, and sette out in oure Authour of the Sphere, <HI>Iohannes de Sacrobosco,</HI> where h&eacute;e playnely sayeth, that without the seauenth Climate, which is bounded by a Paralell, passing at fiftie degr&eacute;es in Lati|tude, all the habitation beyonde that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nine Cli|mates.</NOTE> to be discommodious and intollerable: but <HI>Gemma Phrisius</HI> a late writer, fin|ding <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> to be withoute the compasse of those climates, wherein he knew to be very temperate and good habitation, added therevnto two other Climates, the vttermost Paralell whereof, passeth by .56. degr&eacute;es in La|titude, and therein comprehendeth ouer and aboue the first computation, <HI>England, Scotland, Denmarke, Moscouia,</HI> &amp;c. which all are rich and mightie Kingdomes.</P>
<P>The old writers perswaded by bare coniecture, wente a|boute to determine of those places, by comparing them to their owne complexions, bycause they felt them to be hard|lie tolerable to themselues, and so toke thereby an argu|ment of the whole habitable earth, as if a Man borne in <HI>Morochus,</HI> or other part of <HI>Barbarie,</HI> should at the later end of Sommer, vpon the suddayne, eyther naked, or with hys thinne vesture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A compari|son betweene <HI>Marochus,</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> be broughte into <HI>England,</HI> he woulde iudge this Region presently not to be habitable, bycause he being broughte vp in so warme a Countrey, is not able h&eacute;ere to

liue, for so sodaine an alteration of the colde ayre: but if the same man hadde come at the beginning of Sommer, and so afterwarde by little and little by certaine degr&eacute;es, had felt &amp; acquainted himselfe with the Frost of Autumne, it would haue s&eacute;emed by degr&eacute;es to harden him, and so to make it far more tollerable, and by vse after one y&eacute;ere or two, the ayre woulde s&eacute;eme to hym more temperate. It was compted a greate matter in the olde time, that there was a brasse pot broken in sunder with frosen water in <HI>Ponthus,</HI> which after was broughte and shewed in <HI>Delphis,</HI> in token of a miracu|lous cold region and Winter, and therefore consecrated to the Temple of <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>This effecte being wroughte in the Paralell of .48. de|gr&eacute;es in latitude, it was presentlye compted a place verye hardly and vneasily to be inhabited for the greate cold.

<P>In the prouing of these colde regions habitable, I shall be verye shorte, bicause the same reasons serue for this pur|pose, which were alleaged before in the prouing the middle Zone to be temperate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> especially s&eacute;eing al heate &amp; cold pro|c&eacute;ede from the Sunne, by the meanes eyther of the Angle his beames doeth make with the Horizon, or else by y^e long or shorte continuance of the Suns presence aboue ground: so that if the Sunnes beames do beate perpendicularlye at righte Angles, then there is one cause of heate, and if the Sunne doe also long continue aboue the Horizon, then the heate thereby is muche encreased by accesse of this other cause, and so groweth to a kind of extremitie. And these .ij. causes, as I said before, doe moste concurre vnder the two Tropickes, and therefore there is the greatest heate of y^e worlde. And likewise, where both these causes are most ab|sent, there is greatest want of heate, and encrease of colde (s&eacute;eing that colde is nothing but the priuation and absence of heat) and if one cause be wanting, and the other present, the effect will growe indifferent. Therefore this is to b&eacute;e vnderstanded, that the nearer anye region is to the Equi|noctiall, the higher the Sunne doeth rise ouer their heads at noone, &amp; so maketh either righte or neare righte angles, but the Sun tarryeth with them so much the shorter time, &amp; causeth shorter dayes, with longer and colder nights, to re|store the domage of the daye paste, by reaso~ of the moisture consumed by vapour.

<P>And therefore s&eacute;eing the greatest declination of the Sun is almost .24. degr&eacute;es, it followeth, his greatest height in those Countries to be almost .24. degr&eacute;es.

Therefore w&eacute;e n&eacute;ede no longer to doubt of the temperate and commodious habitation vnder the Poles, during the tyme of Sommer.</P>
<P>But al the controuersie consisteth in the Winter, for then the Sun leaueth those regions, and is no more s&eacute;ene, for the space of other sixe moenths, in the which time al the Sunnes course is vnder their Horizon, for the space of half a yeare, and then those regions (saye some) muste n&eacute;edes be deformed with horrible darkenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nightes vnder y^e Pole</NOTE> and continuall nyghte, whiche maye be the cause that beastes can not s&eacute;eke theyr foode, and that also the cold should then be intollerable.

To al which obiectio~s, may be answered in this maner: First, that thoughe the Sun be absent from them those sixe moneths, yet it followeth not, there should be such extreame darkenesse, for as the Sunne is departed vnder their Horizon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The twy|lights gyue light vnder the Pole al|moste al the Winter.</NOTE> so is it not farre from them. And not so soone as the Sunne falleth, so sodainly commeth the darke night, but the euening doth substitute and prolong the daye a good while after by twilight. After whiche time the residue of y^e night, receiueth light of the Moone and Starres, vntill the breake of the day, which giueth also a certaine light before the Sunnes rising, so that by these meanes the nightes are seldome darke, which is veryfied in al parts of y^e world, but least in the middle Zone vnder the Equinoctiall, where the twylights are short, &amp; the nights darker, than in any other place, bycause the Sun goeth vnder their Horizon so d&eacute;epe, euen to their <HI>Antipodes.</HI> W&eacute;e s&eacute;e in <HI>Englande</HI> in the So~mer nights whe~ the Sun goeth not far vnder the Horizon, that by the light of the Moone &amp; stars, w&eacute;e may trauel al night, &amp; if occasion were, do some other laboure also. And there is no man that doubteth, whether our cattel can s&eacute;e to f&eacute;ede in y^e nights, s&eacute;eing w&eacute;e are so well certified thereof by our expe|rience:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ending of twylight.</NOTE> &amp; by reason of the sphere, our nights should be darker than any time vnder the Poles.</P>
<P>The Astronomers consent, that the Sun descending fro~ our vpper Hemisphere at the .18.

y^e Equinoctiall, are also Paralel to the Horizon, so that the Sun desce~ding vnder y^e Horizon, &amp; there describing certain Paralels not farre distant, doeth not bring darke nights to those Regions, vntil it come to the Paralels distant .18. de|gr&eacute;es fro~ y^e Equinoctial, that is, about y^e .21. degr&eacute;e of <HI>Scorpio</HI> which wil be about y^e .4. day of our Noue~ber, &amp; after y^e Win+ter <HI>Solstitium,</HI> y^e Sun retourning backe againe to y^e .9. degr&eacute;e of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> whiche wil be aboute y^e .19. of Ianuary, during which time only, that is fro~ y^e .4. of Noue~ber, vntill the .xix. day of Ianuary, which is about six w&eacute;eks space, those regi|ons do want y^e co~moditie of twylights.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But sixe weekes dark vnder the Pole.</NOTE> Therefore, during y^e time of these said six moneths of darknesse vnder y^e Poles, y^e night is destitute of y^e benefite of y^e Sun, &amp; y^e said twilights, only for y^e space of six weeks or thereabout. And yet neither this time of six w&eacute;eks is without remedy fro~ Heaue~.

But bycause they knewe not howe long the storme might laste, nor how far off the ships might be put to Sea, nor whether they should euer recouer the~ again or not, they made greate spare of their victualles, as it greatly behoued them: For they knew ful wel, that the best cheare the coun|trey coulde y&eacute;elde them, was golden rockes and stones, a harde foode to liue withall, and the people more readie to eate them, than to giue them wherewithall to eate.

<P>Some are of opinion, that this Weaste Englande is firme lande with the Northeast partes of <HI>Meta Incogni|ta,</HI> or else with <HI>Groenlande.</HI> And their reason is, bicause the people, apparell, boates, and other thinges, are so like to theirs: and an other reason is, the multitude of Ilandes of Ise, whyche laye betw&eacute;ene it and <HI>Meta In|cognita,</HI> doeth argue, that on the North side there is a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, why<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h cannot be, but by co~ioyning of these two lands togither.</P>

<P>And to speake somewhat here, of the auntiente o|pinion of the frosen Sea in these partes: I doe thinke it to be rather a bare coniecture of menne, than that euer anye manne hathe made ex|perience of anye suche Sea. And that whiche they

And also all these aforesaide Ise, which we sometime met a hundreth mile from lande, being gathered out of the salt Sea, are in taste fresh, and being dissolued, become sw&eacute;et and holesome water.</P>
<P>The cause why thys yeare we haue b&eacute;ene more combred with Ise (than at other times before) may be by reason of the Easterly and Southerly windes, whyche brought vs more timely thither now than wee looked for. Whiche blowing from the Sea directlye vppon the place of our straites, hath kept in the Ise, and not suffered them to be caryed out by the ebbe to the maine Sea, where they woulde in more shorte time haue b&eacute;ene dissolued. And all these fl&eacute;eting Ise, are not onelye so daungerous, in that they winde and gather so neare togither, that a man maye passe sometimes tenne or twelue myles as it were vp|on one firme Ilande of Ise: But also, for that they o|pen and shutte togither againe in suche sorte wyth the tydes and Sea-gate, that whilest one Shyppe follo|weth the other with full sayles, the Ise whyche was open vnto the foremoste, will ioyne and close togy|ther, before the latter can come to followe the fyrste, whereby manye tymes oure Shippes were broughte in|to greate daunger, as b&eacute;eyng not able so sodainelye to take in oure sayles, or staye the swifte waye of oure Shippes.</P>
<P>W&eacute;e were forced manye tymes to stemme and strike great rockes of Ise, and so as it were make way through
<PB N="13" REF="63">
mightie mountaines. By which means some of the fl&eacute;ete, where they founde the yse to open, entred in, and pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed so farre within the daunger thereof, with continuall desire to recouer their port, that it was the greatest wonder of the world, that they euer escaped safe, or were euer heard of a|gaine. For euen at this present, we missed two of the fl&eacute;ete, that is, the <HI>Iudyth,</HI> wherein was the Lieuetenaunt general Captaine <HI>Fenton,</HI> and the <HI>Michael,</HI> whome both w&eacute;e suppo|posed hadde bene vtterlye lost, hauing not heard any ty|dings of them, in moe than twentie dayes afore.</P>
<P>And one of our fl&eacute;ete named the Barke <HI>Dennys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is</HI> sunke.</NOTE> being of an hundereth Tunne burden, s&eacute;eking way in amongst these Ise, receiued such a blowe with a rocke of Ise, that she sunke downe therewith, in the sighte of the whoale fl&eacute;ete. Howbeit hauing signified hir daunger by shooting of a p&eacute;ece of great ordinaunce, newe succour of other shippes came so readily vnto them, that the men were al saued with boates.</P>
<P>Within this shippe that was drowned, there was per|cell of our house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the house lost.</NOTE> whiche was to be erected for them that shoulde staye all the Winter in <HI>Meta Incognita.</HI></P>
<P>Thys was a more fearefull spectacle for the Fl&eacute;ete to beholde, for that the outragious storme, which present|lye followed, threatned them the like fortune and daun|ger. For the Fl&eacute;ete being thus compassed (as aforesayde) on euery side with Ise, hauing left muche behynde them, thorow which they had passed, &amp; finding more before them, thorow whiche it was not possible to passe, there arose a sodaine and terrible tempest at the Southeast, which blo|wing from the mayne Sea, directlye vpon the place of the straytes, broughte togither al the Ise a seaborde of vs, vp|on our backes, and thereby debarde as of turning backe to recouer sea roome againe: so that being thus compassed with daunger on euery side, sundrye men with sundrie de|uises, sought the best waye to saue themselues. Some of the
<PB N="14" REF="64">
Shippes, where they could find a place more cleare of Ise, and get a lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le berth of sea roome, did take in their Sayles, and there lay adrift. Other some fastened and mored Ancker vpon a great Iland of Ise, and roade vnder the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee thereof, supposing to be better garded thereby, from the outrageous windes, and the daunger of the lesser fleeting Ise. And a|gaine some were so fast shut vp, and compassed in amongst an infinite number of great Countreys and Ilands of Ise, that they were fayne to submit themselues, &amp; their Ships, to the mercie of the vnmercifull Ise, and strengthned the sides of their Ships with iunckes of cables, beds, Mastes, planckes, and such like, whiche being hanged ouerboord, on the sides of their Shippes, mighte the better defende them from the outragious sway and strokes of the said Ise. But as in greatest distresse, men of best value are best to be dis|cerned, so it is greatly worthy commendation and noting, with what inuincible minde euery Captayne encouraged his company, and with what incredible labour, the payne|full Mariners, and poore Miners (vnaquainted with suche extremities) to the euerlasting renowne of our nation, dyd ouercome the brunt of these so greate and extreame daun|gers: for some, euen without boorde vpon the Ise, and some within boorde, vppon the sides of their Shippes, hauing poles, pikes, p&eacute;eces of timber, and Ores in their handes, stoode almost day and night, withoute any rest, bearing off the force, and breaking the sway of the Ise, with suche in|credible payne and perill, that it was wonderfull to be|hold, which otherwise no doubt had stricken quite through and through the sides of their Shippes, notwithstandyng our former prouision: for planckes of timber, of more than thr&eacute;e ynches thicke, and other things of greater force and bignesse, by the surging of the Sea, and billowe, with the Ise, were sheuered, and cutte in sunder, at the sides of oure Shippes, that it will s&eacute;eme more than credible to be re|ported of. And yet (that whiche is more) it is faythfully and
<PB N="15" REF="64">
playnely to be proued, and that by many substantiall wit|nesses, that our Shippes, euen those of greatest burdens, with the m&eacute;eting of contrary waues of the Sea, were hea|ued vp betw&eacute;ene Ilandes of Ise, a foote weln&eacute;ere out of the Sea, aboue their watermarke, hauing their knees and timbers within boorde, both bowed, and broken therewith.</P>
<P>And amidst these extremes, whilest some laboured for defence of the Shippes, and sought to saue their bodyes: o|thersome of more mylder spirit, soughte to saue the Soule by deuoute Prayer and mediation to the Almightie, thin|king ind&eacute;ede by no other meanes possible, than by a diuine Miracle, to haue their deliuerance: so that there was none, that were eyther ydle, or not well occupyed, and h&eacute;e that helde himselfe in best securitie, had (God knoweth) but on|ly bare hope remayning for his best safetie.</P>
<P>Thus all the gallant Fl&eacute;ete, and miserable men, with|out hope of euer getting forth agayne, distressed with these extremities, remayned h&eacute;ere all the whole night, and parte of the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t day, excepting foure Shippes, that is, the <HI>Anne Frances,</HI> the <HI>Moone,</HI> the <HI>Frances</HI> of <HI>Foy,</HI> and the <HI>Gabriell,</HI> which being somewhat a Seaboorde of the Fl&eacute;ete, and b&eacute;e|ing fast Ships, by a winde, hauing a more scope of cl&eacute;ere, tryed it out all the time of the storme, vnder Sayle, b&eacute;eyng hardly able to beare a coast of each.</P>
<P>And albeit, by reason of the fl&eacute;eting Ise, whych were dispersed h&eacute;ere almost the whole Sea ouer, they were broughte manye times to the extreamest poynte of perill, Mountaynes of Ise tenne thousande tymes scaping them scarce one ynch, whiche to haue stricken, had bin theyr pre|sente destruction, considering the swifte course and way of the Shippes, and the vnwildynesse of them to stay and turne as a ma~ would wish.

meant to bring some certificat of a further discouerie of y^e Countrie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consultation for a further discouerie.</NOTE> which thing to bring to passe (hauing sometime therein consulted) they founde verye harde, and almost in|uincible. And considering, that alreadie they hadde spente some time in searching out the trending and fashion of the mistaken straites, and hadde entred verye farre therein, therefore it coulde not be saide, but that by thys voyage they haue notice of a further discouery, and that the hope of the passage thereby is muche furthered and encreased, as appeared before in the discourse thereof. Yet notwith|standyng, if anye meanes mighte be further deuised, the Capitaynes were contented and willing as the Gene|rall shoulde appointe and commaunde, to take anye en|terprise in hande. Whiche after long debating, was found a thing verye impossible, &amp; that rather consultation was to b&eacute;e had of returning homewarde, especiallye for these cau|ses followyng. First, the darke foggy mistes, the continu|all fallyng Snowe and stormy weather which they com|monly were vexed with, and nowe daylye euer more and more increased, haue no small argument of the Winters drawing neare. And also the froste euerye nighte was so harde congealed within the sounde, that if by euill happe they shoulde be long kepte in wyth contrarye windes, it was greatlye to be feared, that they should be shutte vppe there faste the whole yeare, whyche being vtterly vnpro|uided, woulde be their vtter destruction. Againe, drincke was so scant throughout al the Fl&eacute;ete, by meanes of the greate leakage, that not onely the prouision whiche was layde in for the habitation was wanting and wasted, but also eache Shippes seuerall prouision spent and lost, which many of oure companye, to their greate griefe, founde in their returne since, for al the way homewards they dranke nothing but water.

<P>HAuing nowe receyued Articles and direction for oure returne homewardes, all other things being in for|wardnesse and in good order, the last day of August, the whole Fl&eacute;ete departed from the <HI>Countesses sound,</HI> excep|ting the <HI>Iudith,</HI> and the <HI>Anne Frances,</HI> who stayed for the taking in of fresh water, and came forth the next daye, and mette the Fl&eacute;ete lying off and on, athwart <HI>Beares sounde,</HI> who stayed for the Generall, which then was gone ashore, to dispatch the two Barkes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returne homeward.</NOTE> and the <HI>Busse</HI> of <HI>Bridewater,</HI> for their loading, whereby to get the companyes, and other things aboorde. The Captayne of the <HI>Anne Frances</HI> ha|uing most part of his company ashore, the first of Septem|ber, went also to <HI>Beares sound</HI> in his Pinnesse, to fetch hys men aboorde, but the winde grew so great immediately vp|pon their landing, that the Shippes at Sea were in great danger, and some of them hardly put from their Anckers, and greately feared to be vtterly lost, as the <HI>Hopewell,</HI> wherein was Captayne <HI>Carew</HI> and others, who could not tell on which side their danger was most, for hauing migh|tie Rockes threatning on the one side, and driuing Ilands

of cutting Ise on the otherside, they greatly feared to make shipwrack, y^e Ise driuing so neare the~, that it touched their borde sprete. And by meanes of y^e sea, that was growne so hie, they were not able to put to seas with their smal Pyn|nesses, to recouer their shippes. And againe, the ships were not able to tarrie or lye athwarte for them, by meanes of the outrageous windes &amp; swelling seas. The General wil|led the Captaine of the <HI>Anne France,</HI> with his companye, for that nighte to lodge aboorde the <HI>Busse of Bridgewater,</HI> &amp; went himself with the rest of his men aborde the barkes. But their numbers were so great, and the prouision of the Barkes so scant, that they pestered one another exc&eacute;eding|ly. They had good hope, that the nexte morning the weather woulde be fayre, wherby they might recouer their shippes. But in the morning following it was farre worse, for the storme contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed greater, the sea being more swollen, &amp; the Fl&eacute;ete gone quite out of sighte. So that now their doubts beganne to growe great, for the ship of <HI>Bridgewater</HI> which was of greatest receit, and wherof they had best hope and made most accompt, roade so far to leewarde of the harbo|row mouth, that they were not able for the rockes (that lay betw&eacute;ene the winde and them) to leade it out to sea with a sayle. And the Barkes were so alreadie pestered with me~, and so slenderly furnished of prouision, that they had scarce meate for sixe dayes, for such numbers.</P>
<P>The Generall in the morning departed to sea in the <HI>Gabriel,</HI> to seke for the Fl&eacute;ete, leauing the <HI>Busse of Bridge|water,</HI> and the <HI>Michael,</HI> behinde in <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res sound.</HI> The <HI>Busse</HI> set sayle, and thought by turning in the narrowe channell within the harborow, to get to windewarde: but b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing put to l&eacute;ewarde more. by that meanes was fayne to come to Ancker for hir better safetie, amongst a number of rockes, and there left in great danger, of euer getting forth againe. The <HI>Michaell</HI> set sayle to follow the Generall, and could giue y^e <HI>Busse</HI> no reliefe, although they earnestly desired the

<P>So after, resolued to committe himselfe, withall his company, vnto that fortune of God and sea, h&eacute;e was daun|gerously towed at the sterne of the Barke for many myles, vntill at length they espyed the <HI>Anne Frances</HI> vnder sayle, harde vnder their L&eacute;e, which was no smal comforte vnto them. For no doubt, both those and a great number moe had perished for lacke of victuals, and conueniente roome in the Barkes, without the helpe of the sayde ships. But the honest care that the Maister of the <HI>Anne Frances</HI> had of his Captaine, and the good regarde of dutie towards his General, suffered him not to depart, but honestly abode to hazarde a daungerous roade all the night long, notwith|standing all the stormy weather, when all the Fl&eacute;ete be|sides departed And the Pinnesse came no sooner aborde the shippe, and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n entred, but she presently sheauered and fel in p&eacute;eces, and sunke at the ships sterne, with al the poore mens f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rniture: so weake was the boate with towing, and so so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e was the sea to bruse hir in p&eacute;eces.

And by late conference with a friend of mine (with whome I dyd sometime trauell in the parts of <HI>Moscouy</HI>) who hath great experience of those <HI>Somoweides</HI> &amp; people of y^e Northeast, I finde, that in all their maner of liuing, those people of the Northeast, and these of the Northweast, are like. They are of the couloure of a ripe Oliue, which how it may come to passe, being borne in so cold a climate, I referre to y^e iudge|ment of others, for they are naturally borne children of the same couloure &amp; complexio~ as all the <HI>Americans</HI> are, which dwell vnder the Equinoctiall line.</P>
<P>They are men very actiue and nimble. They are a strong people, and very warlike, for in our sighte, vppon the toppes of the hilles, they would often muster the~selues, and after the maner of a skirmish, trace their ground very nimbly, and mannage their bowes and dartes with greate dexteritie. They goe clad in coates made of the skinnes of beastes, as of Ceales, Dere, Beares, Foxes, and Hares. They haue also some garments of feathers, being made of the cases of Foules, finely sowed and compact togither. Of all which sortes, we broughte home some with vs into <HI>En|gland,</HI> whiche we found in their tents. In Sommer, they vse to weare the hearie side of their coates outwarde, and sometime go naked for too much heate. And in Winter (as by signes they haue declared) they weare foure or fiue folde vpo~ their bodies with y^e heare (for warmth) turned inward. Hereby it appeareth, that the ayre there is not indifferente,

<P>These people are in nature verye subtil, and sharpe witted, readie to concei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e our meaning by signes, and to make answere, well to be vnderstoode againe.

If they vnderstande you not, wherof you aske them, they wil stoppe their eares. They will teache vs the names of eache thing in their lan|guage, which we desire to learne, and are apt to learne any thing of vs. They delight in Musicke aboue measure, and will kepe time and stroke to any tune which you shal sing, both with their voyce, heade, hande and f&eacute;ete, and wyll sing the same tune aptlye after you. They will rowe with our Ores in our boates, and kepe a true stroke with oure Mariners, and s&eacute;eme to take great delight therein. They liue in Caues of the Earth, and hunte for their dinners or praye, euen as the Beare, or other wilde beastes do. They eate rawe fleshe and fishe, and refuse no meate, howsoeuer it be stincking.

They are very shamefast in bewraying the secretes of nature, and verye chaste in y^e maner of their liuing: for whe~ the ma~ which we brought fro~ thence into England y^e last voyage should put of his coat, or discouer his whole body for cha~ge, he would not suffer the woman to be present, but put hir forth of hys Cabyn. And in all the space of two or thr&eacute;e monethes, while the man liued in companie of the woman, there was neuer any thing s&eacute;ene or perceiued betw&eacute;ene them, more than might haue passed betw&eacute;ene brother and sister: but the wo|man was in all things very seruiceable for the man, atten|ding him carefully, when he was sicke, and he likewise in al the meates whiche they did eate togither, would carue vnto hir of the sw&eacute;etest, fattest, and best morsels they had.

And although the Sunne be absent these 3 &frac12; houres, yet is it not darke that time, for that the Sunne is neuer aboue thr&eacute;e or foure degr&eacute;es vnder the edge of their Horizon: the cause is, that the Tropicke <HI>Cancer</HI> doth cutte their Horizon at very vneauen and ob|lique Angles. But the Moone at any time of the yeare b&eacute;e|ing in <HI>Cancer,</HI> hauing North Latitude, doth make a full reuolution aboue their Horizon, so that sometimes they s&eacute;e the Moone aboue .24. houres togither.
