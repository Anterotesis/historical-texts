<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HEre I &s;end un|to you the <HI>Memoires</HI> of our Decea&s;ed Friend, that you have oft|times de&s;ired to peru&s;e; I hope you will meet in
<PB REF="3"> them with that &s;atisfacti|on that you do expect; for they contain many u&s;e|ful Ob&s;ervations, adorned with variety of most plea&s;ant
<HI>ADVENTURES:</HI> They may appear very &s;trange to &s;uch as have &s;een nothing but their Cradle; with them they may obtain the Credit of a well humoured <HI>Ro|mance:</HI> But <HI>Sir,</HI> You are &s;ufficiently acquaint|ed with the integrity of <PB REF="3"> the <HI>AUTHOR,</HI> to cau&s;e you to put a higher value upon this Relation; and I know that you are &s;o well informed of the Proceedings of the <HI>Afri|can</HI> People, that you will not find in it &s;uch incre|dible Wonders as preju|diced per&s;ons may ima|gine. Two or three Pa&s;|&s;ages look like Miracles, but they may be confirm|ed by &s;everal of our Na|tion, both Merchants and <PB REF="4"> Travellers, that have &s;een in tho&s;e parts the things related; from them any may be further in|formed. The Author was not willing to let the world know &s;o much of his Life, had he not been &s;ollicited and almo&s;t for|ced to it by the importuni|ty of tho&s;e who&s;e Request he did not dare to deny. Death hath carried him another Voyage while he was writing this, and <PB REF="4"> forced him to leave his Work unperfect in my hands; could he but re|turn, I doubt not but we might have another Re|lation from him as plea|&s;ant as this, and no le&s;s wonderful.</P>
<P>This Age in which we live is apt to di&s;cre|dit what it under&s;tands not, or &s;ees not acted be|fore its Eyes; but its Malice or Cen&s;ures will never injure the Author; <PB REF="5"> he is &s;afe out of the Reach of Envy: So may this his Relation be in the Pro|tection of &s;o powerful and kind a Patron.

<HEAD>The Adventures of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant taken Captive by the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Argiers,</HI> and carried about the In-land Countries of <HI>Africa,</HI> with ma|ny excellent Ob&s;ervations both curious and profitable.</HEAD>
<P>_THere is nothing ap|pears more wonder|ful than Gods Pro|vidence in the Go|vernance of the World, and in the di&s;po&s;ition of Mankind; it carries us through various E&s;tates, it brings us in Dangers and Mi&s;eries, and in a due time leads us out again by means <PB N="2" REF="6"> not di&s;coverable to our &s;hallow fore&s;ight; it cau&s;eth us to meet with &s;uch different Accidents, which &s;ome may attribute to Chance; but if we take the pains to examine and que&s;tion them, we &s;hall find them to be appointed by a Divine Wi&s;dom for the Publick and our own Advantage:
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> is a Famous In&s;tance; He was &s;old by his Brethren, he pa&s;t through <HI>Potiphera</HI>'s Hou&s;e to the Common Gaol, and from the next door to the Gallows, he was promoted to
<HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Elbow, to pre&s;erve that Kingdom from the Fury of &s;even years Famine. Some it rai&s;es from a Cottage to a Throne; it tumbles others down to the mo&s;t de&s;picable condition: We may &s;ee a
<HI>Belli&s;arius</HI> the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;eful Warrior of his time re|duc'd to beg his Bread in that City that he had re&s;cued from the
<PB N="3" REF="6"> Enemies hands; A proud <HI>Bajazet</HI> who makes the World bow to his Scepter, &s;erves many times for a Foot&s;tool to his Enemy. Modern and Ancient Hi&s;tories are full of &s;uch &s;trange Examples of the Pro|ceedings of Providence, which tend many times only to fa&s;hion and frame us to a certain temper that may make us more u&s;eful in our Generations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not engage my &s;elf to &s;hew all the Intrigues, all the Rea|&s;ons and &s;ecret Actings of Gods Providence, that is the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Divine, and not of one who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion is to Trade.</P>
<P>Some of my Friends have ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired me to give the Pub|lick an Account of &s;ome Ob&s;erva|tions that I have made in my Tra|vels into the In-land Country of <HI>Affrica,</HI> where my Misfortune carried me; I hope that &s;ome may <PB N="4" REF="7"> make no &s;mall Advantage of them.</P>
<P>My Name will be u&s;ele&s;s to the Judicious Reader; I will only tell him, That I was fir&s;t de&s;igned for a Scholar; but an old Pedant &s;oon frighted me from my Studies by his extraordinary Rigour; he gave me &s;uch an aver&s;ion for Learning, which formerly I e&s;teem|ed, that I could not endure the &s;ight of a Book.</P>
<P>My E&s;tate being that of a youn|ger Brother, and but very &s;mall, I was per&s;waded next to embrace the employment of a Merchant; therefore I was bound an Appren|tice to a noted Trader in <HI>London.</HI> After five years abode in his hou&s;e&punc; he re&s;olved to &s;end me as his Fa|ctor to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and other Places within the <HI>Straights.</HI></P>
<P>At that time, in the Year 1648&punc; my Father dies, and my Elder
<PB N="5" REF="7"> Brother was kill'd in our unhappy Troubles. They left me an E&s;tate which might have obliged me to re&s;ide at home, had not the de&s;ire of &s;eeing Foreign Places, and the vain-glory of being named a Tra|veller, with my Ma&s;ters Com|mands, forced me abroad, and to continue in my former De&s;ign. Be|fore my departure, I &s;old &s;ome of my E&s;tate, and bought a
<HI>Cargo</HI> of Goods to the value of two thou|&s;and odd hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>With this and &s;ome Goods be|longing to my Ma&s;ter, I embark|ed towards the latter end of <HI>July</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Hamborough</HI> of 350 Tuns, called the <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> whereof <HI>Peter Jan&s;on</HI> was Ma&s;ter, in the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind favoured us very much out of the Channel, and al|though we met with contrary Gu&s;ts, in 20 days we reach'd as <PB N="6" REF="8"> far as the Cape St. <HI>Vincent.</HI></P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s made us direct our Cour&s;e towards
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> where we had &s;ome Goods to unload.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as we came near the Cape, we &s;aw two Ships to Wind|wards, making all Sail to come up with us; we began to be jealous of their Intentions, and to prepare for our Defence. The Decks were cleared, the Guns charged, and every one had his Place and Office appointed him; we were all between hope and fear, as in &s;uch Ca&s;es is u&s;ual, until their Co|lours had &s;atisfied us. Many idle Conjectures did &s;pread among&s;t us; &s;ome imagined them to be <HI>French</HI> by the make of their Ships, others that they were <HI>Turks;</HI> one wi&s;er than the re&s;t, knew them a|far off, and affirm'd them to be <HI>O&s;tenders,</HI> the &s;ame in which he had formerly &s;ailed, naming the <PB N="7" REF="8"> one the St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> the other the <HI>Capitain.</HI> Our di&s;tru&s;t made us &s;eek the &s;helter of the Land, until at la&s;t we &s;aw <HI>French</HI> Colours out, and heard a Gun that commanded us to &s;trike Sail. Some of our Company well acquainted with &s;uch Tricks of Pirates, advi&s;ed our giddy headed Skipper not to tru&s;t their Appearance, but to con|tinue &s;till his Cour&s;e. But his ill Fortune and ours would not &s;uffer him to follow &s;uch whol&s;om Coun|&s;el, which might have put him and us out of all danger. For although it was the Morning when the Cha&s;e began, and that the Enemy had won much upon us that day, they could never have come up to us until Evening; and in the Night we might have made our E&s;cape, and got into the Harbour. But he had a De&s;ign which we never could well under&s;tand. There|fore <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="8" REF="9"> he commanded to lay by the Wind, until the Ships came within Call. They came too &s;oon for us; at half a League di&s;tance they di&s;co|vered them&s;elves to be <HI>Turks</HI> Men of War by their bloody Colours, which they put out in&s;tead of the White: Then began our Skip|per to be amazed, our Company to be frighted, and every one to be&s;tir him&s;elf. I ob&s;erved a Fel|low who before had &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e in his Legs and hands much like unto the Gout, which made him unprofitable all the time of the Voyage, when he &s;aw the danger, he began to skip about, and han|dle the Guns as if nothing had e|ver ailed him. We had then a|board about a hundred Men with the Pa&s;&s;engers of &s;everal Nations, and thirty great Pieces of Ord|nance, with other &s;maller Guns. It had been an unworthy Act to de|liver
<PB N="9" REF="9"> our &s;elves into the Enemies hands without a &s;troke, being &s;o well provided for our Defence.</P>
<P>About &s;even of the Clock in the Afternoon the <HI>Turks</HI> overtook us, and the formo&s;t Ve&s;&s;el gave us a Broad Side, the other followed, and &s;aluted us in the &s;ame manner. We &s;tood not &s;till in the mean while, but returned them the like. The Fight was furious and bloody on both &s;ides for four hours: Our men hehaved them&s;elves gallantly; neither Death nor Wounds could force them from their Charge and Po&s;ts. Some when their Limbs were all brui&s;ed, their Bones &s;hat|tered, and their Bodies torn with Splinters, did ob&s;tinately continue to handle and manage the Guns. Every one re&s;olved to die with his Weapons in his hand, rather than to &s;hrink in the lea&s;t from the Fight.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">In the &s;pace of four hours we received near fifty Broad &s;ides, and our Enemies were as ob&s;tinate as our &s;elves.</P>
<P>At la&s;t our Number was redu|ced to 18 men, and tho&s;e were wounded in &s;everal places, the re&s;t were either dead or di&s;abled. The Skipper was &s;hot through the Thigh, my &s;elf through the right Arm; &s;o that we could no longer re&s;i&s;t the Numbers and Fury of our Enemies, that continued &s;till to poure upon us great and &s;mall Shot: Be&s;ides we had another Misfortune that happened unto us happily as it fell out; our Ship was wounded with a great Shot between Wind and Water, &s;o that being in &s;uch a cra&s;ie Ve&s;&s;el, and with &s;uch cra&s;ie Bodies, we made but a faint re&s;i&s;tance, which the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving, and fearing that the Sea would at la&s;t &s;wallow us, <PB N="11" REF="10"> and deprive them of their Booty, they re&s;olved to venture to board us: On both &s;ides they grappled with us, and entered their men, which we from our Fore-Ca&s;tle and Steerage did force aboard a|gain with our Murdering Pieces; at la&s;t, for fear our Ob&s;tinacy would cau&s;e our Ship to &s;ink un|der us, and deliver us into the hands of a more mercile&s;s Enemy, the raging Sea; we called for Quarter, which the <HI>Turks</HI> were glad to grant, having almo&s;t lo&s;t all Courage and hopes of forcing us to a Surrender; therefore they willingly accepted of the fir&s;t Mo|tion: We found that near 300 of their men had been killed, and their Ships were mi&s;erably torn and maimed. One thing pa&s;&s;ed during the Fight worthy our No|tice, and which I did then look upon as an ill Omen; at a Broad
<PB N="12" REF="11"> Side one great Shot was forced back again, and &s;plit in pieces; we did conceive that it had met with a more violent one, which had driven it upon us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> treated us very ge|nerou&s;ly, that we expected not from Enemies which we had an|gered by &s;o long a Re&s;i&s;tance. They commended our Courage, and wondered at our Re&s;olution. And when they &s;aw the rich Loading that they had got into their hands, they quickly pardoned us the In|juries we had done them.</P>
<P>The Captains and Owners of the <HI>Turks</HI> Ships called me &amp; our Skip|per to an Account for the Bills of Loading, which, when there was no remedy, we delivered into their hands.</P>
<P>I made &s;ome Reflections upon my former Condition, and wi&s;hed my &s;elf upon &s;ome Chri&s;tian &s;hore <PB N="13" REF="11"> as poor as
<HI>Job;</HI> Liberty was &s;weet to me that was taken a Slave: I remembred then that excellent ad|vice, <HI>Tru&s;t not unto uncertain riches, &amp;c.</HI> I then condemned the joy I had felt for the rich Patrimony that was left me, and the earne&s;t de&s;ire for to &s;ee Foreign Places. Now to my &s;orrow I began to re|member my former Condition; but all the&s;e Reflections and Re|grets could not turn the Wind, nor &s;top our Cour&s;e from
<HI>Argiers,</HI> where we were bound next; for when our Ship had been &s;eized, we that were alive were di&s;po&s;ed of into the Enemies Ships, and &s;tript of our be&s;t Attire, which &s;ome lu&s;ty Rogues did us the kindne&s;s to wear for our &s;akes before our eyes.</P>
<P>Our dead Bodies, and tho&s;e that were wounded de&s;perately, of whom there was &s;mall hopes, <PB N="14" REF="12"> were &s;tript naked, and &s;ent in that condition to feed the Sharkes and other Ravenous Fi&s;hes of the Sea; &s;ome we &s;aw at that In&s;tant wait|ing upon us, as we did conceive, for that intent: It may be they were as &s;en&s;ible of dead Bodies a|mong&s;t us, as Vultures are, who con&s;tantly hover about a Hou&s;e or Tent in the&s;e Countries, where the Sick are contained that will in|fallibly die, in hopes to enjoy the Prey when it is to be expo&s;ed and carried out.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay a &s;hipboard, we were as civilly treated as we could expect from <HI>Turks,</HI> and did feed as they did upon Garlick &amp; Rusk, poor <HI>John,</HI> Rice, &amp; &s;uch like food. I ob&s;erved them very inqui&s;itive to find out our Qualities, and the E&s;tates that we had remaining, our Friends, and what A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Favour we might expect from <PB N="15" REF="12"> them. To know the&s;e Particulars, we were examined apart: We had been forewarned of this Proceed|ing, and therefore we had prepa|red our An&s;wers, that we might not be found in a contradiction. I had de&s;ired our Company to make me pa&s;s for a poor Fellow, who&s;e Indu&s;try had obtained the Tru&s;t of that con&s;iderable <HI>Cargo,</HI> which as we did give out did belong to my Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This An&s;wer &s;atisfied them for a while, but meeting in the Ship with &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Renegadoes, by an incon&s;iderate Di&s;cour&s;e about &s;everal Particulars, one of them began to have &s;ome &s;u&s;pition and knowledge of me, becau&s;e he had &s;een me at the unloading of &s;ome Goods by the Water &s;ide, and did remember that then more re&s;pect was paid to me than &s;uch a poor Fellow could expect or claim. I
<PB N="16" REF="13"> laboured to excu&s;e my Ra&s;hne&s;s, and to ju&s;tifie my former Declara|tion; neverthele&s;s one word made me to be &s;u&s;pected for an eminent Per&s;on, powerful in Friends and Acquaintance, which made them put a higher Value upon me, and hope for a greater Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed into the <HI>Streights,</HI> and at the Entry, over again&s;t <HI>Gibral|tar,</HI> we met with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War at &s;ome di&s;tance from us; he laboured to come to &s;peak with us, but the
<HI>Turks</HI> were not in a Po&s;ture, nor able to an&s;wer him in his own Language &s;o loud as he could &s;peak; for in the de&s;pe|rate Fight they had broken &s;ome of their Ribs, and weakned them|&s;elves; therefore they hoi&s;ed up all their Sails, and made away as fa&s;t as the Prize-Ship could &s;ail. She received &s;ome Cha&s;e Guns from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who had almo&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="13"> retaken her, but the Evening drawing on, &s;he had the opportu|nity of &s;aving her &s;elf in the dark night: And the better to hinder the <HI>Spaniard</HI> from further Pur&s;uit, one of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;taid behind, and re&s;olutely gave a few Broad Sides to his Enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Prize got out of &s;ight, and the
<HI>Turks</HI> Ve&s;&s;el followed with all &s;peed. The Night coming on apace, rid them of the importune company of the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we anchored in the Bay of <HI>Algiers,</HI> where &s;ome Officers of the Town came to take notice of our Number, and of the Prize that was taken; one was a <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> man, that by his Apo&s;ta|&s;ie had procured unto him&s;elf great Wealth among&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> he was a Trader in Slaves, and knew well how to make his advan|tage <PB N="18" REF="14"> of his own Nation. He drew near us that were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and en|quired of us in what part of <HI>Eng|land</HI> we had been born; &s;uch Que|&s;tions being unplea&s;ing to us, I de|&s;ired as he was our Countreyman, that he would &s;hew us &s;ome Fa|vour, and buy us for him&s;elf; we hoped to meet with a kinder En|tertainment from one of the &s;ame Language and People: He told us that if we did give him hopes of returning his Money, he would venture to lay out &s;ome to do us a plea&s;ure, that we might not fall into &s;evere hands that might en|danger our Lives by a rough U|&s;age. He informed us, that if we came on &s;hore, we &s;hould be led to the Market, and there &s;old as Hor&s;es; That there are con&s;tant|ly waiting &s;ome that knew how to find us out, that would treat us mo&s;t inhumanely, and oblige us <PB N="19" REF="14"> to redeem our &s;elves; That they would exact from us the remainder of our E&s;tates to be at liberty; That we had be&s;t come into his hands; That he being our Coun|treyman, would endeavour to be our Friend, and take no more from us than it co&s;t him: Therefore he conjured us to di&s;cover our &s;elves if we did love our own &s;afe|ty and welfare, and to tell him what Encouragement he might have to lay out his Money for us, and what Security to have it re|turned. We began to look one upon another, to under&s;tand with our Eyes how inclinable each was to comply with his De&s;ire. We were &s;omething jealous of the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Faith, and did believe that he that had not kept it to his God, would &s;carce be more careful to keep it with Men. We were long &s;ilent, and knew not what we <PB N="20" REF="15"> &s;hould do in this ca&s;e; but at la&s;t I ventured to deliver the Sen&s;e of the Company, and to thank him in the name of four or five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that we were, for his kind Information, telling him that our Lo&s;&s;es were great, that our Friends were many, that we had &s;ome|thing yet left at home able to re|deem us, were not too high a va|lue put upon us, and that we could give him &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance that what I &s;aid was true.</P>
<P>At this Di&s;covery all my Com|rades began earne&s;tly to intreat him to &s;hew &s;ome Favour to his Countreymen promi&s;ing to re+quite his Kindne&s;s with double in+tere&s;t.</P>
<P>Unto all our Offers the Deceit+ful <HI>Turk</HI> began to li&s;ten diligently for we afterwards &s;aw that he in+tended only to make a Prey of us and get &s;uch Information from u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="21" REF="15"> as might &s;erve his turn. We be|gan to &s;u&s;pect him, and be &s;orry for our credulity, when we per|ceived him in the company of the Owners of the Ship, offering for the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of us large Sums of Money, leaving the re&s;t to their ill fortune, without the lea&s;t regard: They could not then agree about the Price, &s;o that we were tran&s;ported a&s;hore. At our fir&s;t Landing, great Companies flock'd about us to &s;ee us, having been fore-informed that we had behaved our &s;elves like men of Courage in the Fight. Some who&s;e Relations had been killed, gave us &s;uch Welcome as became the cruelty and impertinency of Hea|thens: They loaded us with Cur&s;es and Imprecations, and did &s;trange|ly in&s;ult over us. Had not our Guardians protected us from their Violence, I think we had been torn
<PB N="22" REF="16"> in pieces. One among&s;t the re&s;t was animated with a &s;trange fury and de&s;ire of revenge for the death of his dear Comrade; both were <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renegadoes: He drew his Cymeter at us, and begg'd the li|berty to &s;acrifice one of us, promi|&s;ing to pay his Ran&s;ome: When that could not be obtained, he de|&s;ired only to cut off our Ears. I know not how it happened that he came near one of us, and with a Blow &s;truck off part of the Cheek of a <HI>German,</HI> which he took and greedily &s;wallowed, telling the A&s;&s;i&s;tants that he never ta&s;ted &s;o &s;weet a Mor&s;el in his days as that was; &s;o &s;trangely Vengeance had transported him, that he was con|tent to feed upon us. It was our happine&s;s that our Lives did not depend upon his plea&s;ure, we had then accompanied his Comrade in the other world; but our Keepers <PB N="23" REF="16"> did &s;afely convey us into the City, where we found our Chains ready made that waited for us. Every one of us had a great &s;trong Chain about twenty pound weight link'd to our Legs and tyed to our Gir|dle, that if we did meditate an e&s;|cape, it might not be without dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>We were conducted next in this &s;trange equipage with our jingling Chains at our &s;ides to the Kings Palace; we did not a little wonder what they intended to do with us in a place of &s;o much Ho|nour. We pa&s;t the fir&s;t Guard, and entred into a large and &s;pati|ous Court paved with white Mar|ble-Stone, of which there is a great quantity in that Country; e&s;peci|ally in the <HI>Quarries about old Car|thage</HI> or <HI>Tunis.</HI> There was a high Brick Wall that inclo&s;ed us, and before us opened a large Gate <PB N="24" REF="17"> Chequer'd with divers Colours, which led into a great Hall, where our Keepers led us, and command|ed us to re&s;t our &s;elves until the King of <HI>Argiers</HI> did give us a Vi&s;it; an honour that we expected not; but it &s;eems it is the Cu&s;tom that all Slaves &s;hould come in his &s;ight when they fir&s;t Land; for out of them he chu&s;es for him&s;elf the Tenth Per&s;on; and when that Number is not compleat, he never|thele&s;s takes one whom he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>We were placed round about the Hall to be prepared for his Coming in, which was not &s;peedi|ly; for being about Noon, he had been bathing him&s;elf, and after|wards taking another Recreation, which is u&s;ual at that time of day in the hot Climates.</P>
<P>About Two of the Clock in comes a lu&s;ty Officer clothed in Scarlet, with a Rod in his hand, <PB N="25" REF="17"> and a great Turbant about his Head; it &s;eems he was the King's Gentleman U&s;her: He was fol|lowed by &s;ix Per&s;ons of good Meen and Appearance: They were armed with Cymeters.</P>
<P>Next came a Grave Fellow with a Turbant almo&s;t as big as our
<HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Half Bu&s;hel; at one &s;ide of it he had a Set of Diamonds, that did &s;parkle as his Eyes; his Ve|&s;ture was green, his Legs were bare, on his Feet he did wear San|dals.</P>
<P>We had time to ob&s;erve him as he entred the Door; for his Pace was &s;low and grave: I could have numbred 20 between every Step; He marcht in that manner to the upper end, where there was a Ca|nopy of State over his Head, and two Turky Carpets, with a large Pillow covered with Damask under him; he &s;ate upon it, <PB N="26" REF="18"> and then the Owners of the Ship that took us, pre&s;ented them&s;elves before him, ki&s;&s;ing the Hem of his Garment; they di&s;cour&s;ed among them&s;elves about an hour, &s;hewing unto him our Bills of Lading; a <HI>German</HI> of our Company under|&s;tood &s;omething of their Di&s;cour&s;e, he told us that the King, who only &s;ate, all the re&s;t &s;tanding about him, was di&s;plea&s;ed that they had not followed his Orders when they &s;et out; for it &s;eems he had com|manded them to &s;ail along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and to endeavour to revenge him for the great lo&s;s which he had lately &s;u&s;tained, when one of his be&s;t Ve&s;&s;els that was &s;ent out upon his private account, was made Prize by the Galleys of that Republick.</P>
<P>The Di&s;pute ended with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Owners of our Ve&s;&s;el, and a Pre&s;ent very con&s;i|derable <PB N="27" REF="18"> in Cloth and other rich Commodities taken out of our Prize.</P>
<P>The Kings Di&s;plea&s;ure was &s;oon abated, when he &s;aw &s;uch an Ho|nourable Gift enter into his Hall. He took a view of it, and then commanded us to come before him one by one; He look'd upon us with a &s;tern Countenance, and took notice of our Features and Stature; for it &s;eems the
<HI>Turks</HI> are excellent in the Art of Phy&s;iogno|my; they know a man and his In|clinations at the fir&s;t view, as well as an expert Farrier can the good or ill Qualities of a Hor&s;e: It con|cerns them much, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that trade in Slaves. He ca&s;t a Je&s;t upon every one of us, which gave the Company a great deal of Mirth, and increas'd our &s;adne&s;s. I was inform'd that he &s;aid, That he advis'd him that &s;hould be my
<PB N="28" REF="19"> Ma&s;ter, not to tru&s;t me too much with his Women.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when he had con&s;ider|ed us all, he made us &s;tand before him together; out of the Compa|ny he cho&s;e my &s;elf, the Skipper, and a pretty <HI>German</HI> Boy of a rud|dy Countenance: I did not a lit|le wonder at this la&s;t Choice, be|cau&s;e there were &s;ome of whom he might expect a greater Ran&s;om than of the Child, who was born of poor Parentage; but I under|&s;tood the good old man was a greater Lover of his Plea&s;ures than of Money, and therefore he pitcht upon him as upon one who might procure unto him &s;ome in his old Age; a &s;trange Fancy po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the minds of all the Southern People; they burn with an unna|tural Fire, which con&s;umed
<HI>So|dom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;trange to &s;ee how pa&s;&s;io|nate <PB N="29" REF="19"> they are for hand&s;om Males: I was glad to be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King, for I hoped to pre|vail with him and get my Free|dom to return for
<HI>England;</HI> but I was much deceived of my ex|pectation, as you &s;hall learn. The King being returned to his private Chambers &s;ent for me, and en|quired of my Quality, and of my Friends, and what Trade I under|&s;tood be&s;t: I was puzzled at this la&s;t que&s;tion, and knew not how to an&s;wer him be&s;t for my advan|tage; I was afraid to render my &s;elf too nece&s;&s;ary to him, that he might not retain me in his &s;ervice; or to make my &s;elf too con&s;ide|rable, that he might not put a higher value upon me than I was willing to pay for my Ran&s;om: Therefore I told him that I was born of poor Parentage, who not being able to keep me, put me to <PB N="30" REF="20"> be an Under-Cook to a Noble Man of our Country; that from that employment I was removed to be an Apprentice to a rich Merchant, who received me be|cau&s;e he found me able to do him &s;ervice; and that I was &s;ent with his Goods to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and other Parts, as his Factor; that it was true, &s;ome of the Bills of Lading did mention my Name, but the Goods did belong to my Ma&s;ter, and &s;ome Friends who had intru&s;t|ed me with them.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Information plea&s;ed the old man, e&s;pecially when he heard I was a Cook; for one that had &s;erved him in that employ|ment was lately dead. I was &s;ent immediately to the Kitchin, and had order to dre&s;s a Couple of Wild Ducks for my Ma&s;ter; that I did without much difficulty: but when I had other Meats le&s;s <PB N="31" REF="20"> u&s;ual in our Country, I made &s;uch mad Sauces, and &s;uch &s;trange <HI>Ra|goux,</HI> that every one took me for a Cook of the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> who&s;e People have Palates that reli&s;h things that ours abhor: I was full of Mi&s;takes; &s;ometimes I put Oyl in&s;tead of Vinegar, and Salt in&s;tead of Pepper. But that I might keep up my Credit among&s;t the Beholders, I did handle my Meat &s;o nimbly, that they all be|lieved I had been u&s;ed to Coo|kery.</P>
<P>I had not been long in the Kit|chen, but I heard that the King lamented the Death of his former Cook, and was not plea&s;ed with the Sauces I had made; neverthe|le&s;s I continued in my em|ployment about &s;ix Weeks, more e&s;teemed for my new-found mi&s;|ma&s;hes than I de&s;erved.</P>
<P>At a great Fea&s;t that my Ma&s;ter <PB N="32" REF="21"> made, I had &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;hes that I never &s;aw before; the Liver of one hath a mo&s;t loath&s;om ta&s;t, I thought it good in the Sawce; therefore I &s;ent it up &s;tewed under the Fi&s;h, with a Di&s;h garni&s;h'd with many &s;orts of Flowers: The Gue&s;ts &s;eeing &s;o plea&s;ant an Ap|pearance, expected the Fi&s;h to be as extraordinary as the Beauty; they all prepared their Stomachs to feed upon this Fi&s;h, and neg|lected others that were much bet|ter; but when they ta&s;ted the Sawce, they imagined &s;ome had put a Sir-reverence in it, and all began to &s;pue and &s;pit. I anger|ed &s;o much the King with this Ma|&s;ter-piece of Cookery, that he gave Order that I &s;hould receive for my Sallery ten Ba&s;tonadoes. It was in vain to plead Ignorance, &amp; our Country Fa&s;hion; I was for|ced to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment with Patience.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="21">At the Fea&s;t there was an Inha|bitant of the Town who had been very much pleas'd with the Sauces that others did di&s;like; when he &s;aw the King &s;o angry with me, de|&s;ired him to part with me for the u&s;ual Ran&s;om; he refu&s;ed it for the pre&s;ent: but afterwards he was glad to be rid of me at any rate.</P>
<P>I was removed from being Ma|&s;ter Cook to a lower place, &amp; a
<HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Slave was placed in my room. He did &s;o domineer over me that I could not &s;uffer his Impertinen|cies: I plaid him &s;everal Tricks; once I made a &s;trange Infu&s;ion in a Di&s;h that was to be pre&s;ented to the King; it almo&s;t co&s;t the Slaves Life; he excu&s;es, and laid the Fault upon me: I pretended a great deal of Ignorance, but was not believed. This cau&s;ed my removal to another employment, <PB N="34" REF="22"> which I heartily longed for. I was made by a wonderful change of Fortune Keeper of the Kings Bath. It &s;eems &s;ome of his Women had &s;een me in the Hou&s;e, and interce|ded for me when the la&s;t Di&s;grace happened to me. I thought my &s;elf then a pretty Fellow, and not inferiour to my former E&s;tate; but Fortune left me not long rejoy|cing at my Promotion; her &s;ud|den Favour was followed by a grievous Frown, that almo&s;t &s;ent me to my Grave: The occa&s;ion of it was this; One of the Kings Wives having &s;o happily pleaded for me, as the good man thought, out of a tenderne&s;s natural to all that Sex; and as &s;he then pre|tended, out of a Kindne&s;s for Peo|ple of my Nation, &s;he &s;ought a fit opportunity to di&s;cover her &s;elf to me, and make u&s;e of my Bath when the King was abroad: I was at <PB N="35" REF="22"> fir&s;t more re&s;pectful than &s;he did de&s;ire, and left her to the Atten|dance of her Women Slaves; one that was her Confident, informed me of the Matter of her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Plea&s;ure, and added, that I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hould do well to comply, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">+ry or di&s;appoint her Kindne&s;s by any ungrateful &s;everity.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s came &s;oon to the Kings Ear; his jealous Pate had an Eye upon a young Stripling that was not unworthy to &s;upply his place; but it &s;eems he never had a right Information, only &s;ome light &s;u&s;pitions of our Corre&s;pondency; they were &s;ufficient to cau&s;e him to remove me from my plea&s;ant Of|fice; which angered me more than any thing that happened to me all the time of my Slavery.</P>
<P>I found an opportunity to make my Complaints to my good Lady, who was no le&s;s troubled at the <PB N="36" REF="23"> old mans peevi&s;h humour than my &s;elf.</P>
<P>There was no Remedy to our Grief, but the hopes of meeting in &s;ome other Corner of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent next to work in the Fields, where I met with &s;uch dif|ficult and painful Labour, and &s;uch cruel Task-Ma&s;ters, that I fell grievou&s;ly &s;ick; my good Lady did not forget to admini&s;ter Com|fort unto me by the means of her <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman: In my lowe&s;t E&s;tate &s;he vouch&s;afed to pay me a Vi&s;it, and would not &s;uffer me to want any thing that Credit could procure.</P>
<P>It was a happine&s;s to me to meet here with &s;uch a true Friend&punc; I could have wi&s;hed that my Sick|ne&s;s had la&s;ted longer for her &s;ake.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner recovered, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="37" REF="23"> my old doting Patron fearing a Relap&s;e, or rather growing more jealous of me, gave order that I &s;hould be led into the Market-Place and there &s;old: I had made my application to him to be re|deemed, I had &s;ent Letters into <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and endevou|red to be relea&s;ed, but all in vain; he lookt upon me as &s;o needy a fel|low that could not procure the ordinary Ran&s;om of a Slave from my Friends. I had laboured to per&s;wade &s;omething of it, during my abode in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw my &s;elf with an ill-favoured <HI>Turk,</HI> leading me by a Chain, as a Hor&s;e or a Bullock, thorough the &s;treets, I then began to lament my hard fortune, and remember my former E&s;tate; I knew not what Providence had prepared for me, nor what &s;urly Ma&s;ter I &s;hould meet with next: <PB N="38" REF="24"> I went with a &s;ad Countenance, and as &s;ad a Heart to the publick Place, where I was to be expo&s;ed to Sale.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turk</HI> that led me, cryed be|fore me in <HI>Franca Langua, Who will buy a Chri&s;tian? Who will buy a Chri&s;tian?</HI></P>
<P>It was a grievous change of for|tune, in &s;o &s;hort a time as a year, to be reduced from that honoura|ble E&s;tate in which my Father left me, to the lowe&s;t Mi&s;ery, to a Slave, to be &s;old as a Bea&s;t, in a &s;trange Countrey, where I had no Friends that did dare to own me. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was never &s;o deject|ed as at this time. I did complain of my hard Fate, and did &s;end up many &s;ighs and groans to Heaven, to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and care of Divine Providence: In this low Condition I knew not what it had prepared for me.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="24">A&s;&s;oon as I was come into the Market-place, a Fellow, a Stran|ger to me, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to my Keeper, and offers Money for my Per&s;on: He &s;eem'd to be a man of no great Appearance; yet his Looks di&s;covered him to be a good man.</P>
<P>Several others came about me, and among&s;t the re&s;t, that ill-na|tur'd <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Renegate that enqui|red of our qualities &s;o exactly on &s;hipboard, acco&s;ted my Keeper, and would needs have me at any Rate: I trembled for fear of fal|ling into his hands, knowing how grievou&s;ly he had handled &s;ome of my Comrades.</P>
<P>My Keeper made advantage of the Pre&s;s, and ask'd a hundred Dollars more than he was com|manded to take for me. The fir&s;t would not let me &s;lip out of his hands; therefore he paid the mo|ney, <PB N="40" REF="25"> and led me away with him to a Hou&s;e next to the Grand Mo&s;que of the City, very near the Kings Palace.</P>
<P>I was not a little pleas'd to be &s;o near the Place from which I might expect &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance; much more, when I &s;aw the good
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman pay me a Vi&s;it from her Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;he had ordered this Fellow to watch when I was to be &s;old, and to buy me for her Ser|vice. I thought my &s;elf happy to be a Slave to &s;o excellent and kind a Lady: I never dreamt of a Change whil&s;t I belonged unto her: I had no rea&s;on; for nothing was wanting unto me u&s;eful to the Life of Man. I only wore a Chain out of Formality, becau&s;e other|wi&s;e my good Fortune might have been &s;u&s;pected. I did al&s;o employ my &s;elf in &s;lavi&s;h work for that <PB N="41" REF="25"> intent, but not above mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Lady became very devout after my coming to that place; &s;he &s;eldom mi&s;s'd a day, but came in &s;ome Di&s;gui&s;e to pay her Devo|tions at the Mo&s;quette, from whence there was a pa&s;&s;age into my Lodgings,</P>
<P>By this frequent and con&s;tant Attendance at Publick Prayer, &s;he purchas'd unto her &s;elf a very great e&s;teem with the People, and a favour with her Husband; and ever after &s;he was named a Saint.</P>
<P>I continued her Slave about two years, in which time I did view the City of <HI>Argiers,</HI> and took an e&s;pecial notice of many Parti|culars worth the publick know|ledge.</P>
<P>It is a City not &s;o large as popu|lous, fortified by Art and Nature; the Walls are 60 foot high, in &s;ome places 70 and 80; they are built
<PB N="42" REF="26"> with &s;quare Stone and Flints: they are about 12 and 13 Foot broad.</P>
<P>The City is not above a Mile round. At the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, on the top of a high Hill &s;tands a &s;trong Cittadel very well fortified, built at fir&s;t by the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> It is fur|ni&s;hed with 40 or 50 Pieces of Ordnance, and kept by 300 Re|negadoes in Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t &s;ide another Ca&s;tle &s;omewhat le&s;s, but altogether as &s;trong, doth overlook the Town. In the Harbour is built a very commodious Mould, able to con|tain above 200 Sail. Upon it &s;tands a &s;trong Fort, that threatens De|&s;truction to all Ve&s;&s;els that dare adventure near without leave, or in a Ho&s;tile manner: Three Tier of Guns are planted in it; the lowe&s;t is level with the Water.</P>
<P>The Mould lies in &s;uch a croo|ked manner, that no Ships can
<PB N="43" REF="26"> with their full Sail come &s;traight in without turning: So that it is a very difficult work to break the Chain and enter it by force.</P>
<P>This Ne&s;t of Pirates is very well prepared for the Attempts of any Chri&s;tian Enemy. None can do them the lea&s;t injury by Land or by Sea: &s;o that here they re|treat as the Wild Bea&s;ts in their Dens to enjoy their Thefts and Prey.</P>
<P>That which renders the Town more &s;trong, is, that it is built upon a hard Rock, and cannot ea|&s;ily be undermined.</P>
<P>I have taken notice of 3 Places in the Ca&s;tles that are but weak; In the great Cittadel, on the South &s;ide, is a ri&s;ing Hill as high as the half of the Wall, if it was po&s;&s;e&s;s|ed by a powerful Enemy, it might &s;erve very commodiou&s;ly either for Battery or Mining.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="27">On the Ea&s;t &s;ide is but a weak Wall, that would not endure long the Fury of the Canon.</P>
<P>The other Ca&s;tle hath many lit|tle Hills that are equal in height; be&s;ides, the Wall in the Town in one place is not &s;o &s;trong, but an Enemy might enter by it.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. attempted to drive the&s;e Pirates out of their Ne&s;t, but it was to no purpo&s;e that he brought a Navy by Sea, and Landed a pui&s;&s;ant Army to be&s;iege the Town; the violence of a &s;torm broke his Ve&s;&s;els to pieces, and forced him to rai&s;e his Siege with the lo&s;s of a hundred Ships, and ma|ny thou&s;and Men. Since that time
<HI>Argiers</HI> is much &s;tronger, and bet|ter fortified: Daily &s;omething is added to the &s;trength of it; &s;o that unle&s;s the Chri&s;tian Princes join together, or &s;ome powerful Monarch by Sea &amp; Land lay &s;iege
<PB N="45" REF="27"> to it, it will be one day impregna|ble but by Famine.</P>
<P>In the City the Hou&s;es are very plea&s;ant, and more beautiful with|in and without than in other Parts of <HI>Affrica.</HI> The greater lie open in the middle, with hand&s;om Gal|leries and Turrets.</P>
<P>Several Mo&s;quets are built for Publick Devotion, into which no Chri&s;tian hath liberty to enter, un|le&s;s he intends to Apo&s;tatize; for he mu&s;t either burn or turn that enters the Place of their Prayer, that handles the <HI>Alcoran</HI> before Witne&s;&s;es, or that repeats their <HI>Illa Alla Mahumet,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have a great number of their <HI>Talubs,</HI> Religious Men, who&s;e Duty is to read their Publick Prayers. They have many other &s;orts of Men appointed to attend in their <HI>Mo&s;quets;</HI> &s;ome are to ex|pound the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law, and <PB N="46" REF="28"> they are called
<HI>Cadirs;</HI> others are to invite the People to their De|votions, and they are named <HI>Der|vi&s;es;</HI> &s;ome live by the Alms of the People; others are Prophets and holy Men.</P>
<P>Over all the Religious Orders there is one e&s;tabli&s;hed as the Su|preme Judge of all Controver|&s;ies, and he is honoured with the Title of
<HI>Marabut:</HI> He is the Judge between Man and Man, of Matters of Equity and Ju&s;tice. A certain &s;ti|pend is allowed unto him from the Publick Trea&s;ury. He lives not upon the Inferiour Orders; every one hath a &s;etled Salary. The great &s;wallow the little ones, as Fi&s;hes; they feed upon them, and from their Labours derive a main|tenance to their idle Bodies: a &s;ad encouragement to Lazine&s;s &amp; Vice, and the grand Cau&s;e of the Di&s;orders of a Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="28">Other Per&s;ons be&s;ides the King and Ba&s;haw are eminent in this City; the <HI>Lagaw</HI> is the Chief in the next place, He is the fir&s;t per|&s;on of the <HI>Duan,</HI> and is the Gene|ral of the Armies abroad: Under him are the <HI>Cheu&s;es,</HI> which are like our Ju&s;tices of Peace, or Sheriffs. The next are <HI>Boulgebu&s;hes,</HI> Men like our Bayliffs; they are Ser|vants to the <HI>Duan:</HI> They remain three years in their Offices, and then go out with the Armies as Controulers of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, are other <HI>Bu&s;hes,</HI> Captains and Officers of the Mili|tia; they wear a Badge of Honour on their Heads, and are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t by their Turbant, that is wound about in the form of a Sugar-Loaf; behind a Red Cro&s;s falls down: It is not lawful for any to take this At|tire but them&s;elves. It is the <PB N="48" REF="29"> Badge of their Office, as the Red Scarf is the Sign of Command a|mong&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>In the Camp there are other Great Men; as <HI>Daventees, Mou|chees,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>An <HI>Acha Ba&s;ha</HI> is an experien|ced man among&s;t them, one that hath been in &s;everal Encounters, who commands a Party when it is &s;eparated from the Main Body. He mu&s;t be an old man, and when once he comes to that Employ|ment, he can ri&s;e no higher as o|ther Officers can.</P>
<P>About the City are mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Gardens, Orchards, and fair Hou&s;es belonging to the Inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>Further in the Countrey, very good Corn grows upon the little Hills that appear round about.</P>
<P>Here is plenty of all things un|le&s;s it be of Wine, which is not
<PB N="49" REF="29"> made by the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors.</HI> They of
<HI>Argiers</HI> are not &s;o &s;crupulous as the &s;tricter &s;ort; their Con&s;ciences can &s;uffer them to be drunk with Wine when they take good &s;tore in Prizes.</P>
<P>In the City, towards the Ea&s;t &s;ide, is a very &s;trong Hou&s;e built, and &s;ome Souldiers to keep guard. I enquired what the Place was, and I was informed that it was the Publick Trea&s;ury-Hou&s;e: Every year they ca&s;t in va&s;t Sums of Mo|ney, according to their happine&s;s in the Encounters with Chri&s;tians. They never take out of it: It is thought there are many Millions &s;hut up in that Hole. The la&s;t <HI>Barbaro&s;&s;a</HI> built it for the Publick; and to encourage the re&s;t to give liberally, he put in 2000 Dol|ars.</P>
<P>When the Ships come in, and when the Lots are made, there is
<PB N="50" REF="30"> alwaies &s;omething for the Trea&s;u|ry, and a good Portion for <HI>Maho|met.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems the&s;e Heathens have Religion enough to make them honour their Prophet, and tho&s;e that repre&s;ent his Place among&s;t them; for the mo&s;t part &s;uch are good for nothing el&s;e but to &s;ay the Publick Prayers: Yet the People are &s;o far from de&s;pi&s;ing them, that they bear a great re|&s;pect unto them; and &s;uffer not any to be in want that attends at their Devotions.</P>
<P>This Portion which is called the Portion of <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the Divi&s;i|on of the Prize-Goods, is put in|to the Hands of a Trea&s;urer ap|pointed for that purpo&s;e, and he di&s;tributes equally to all their Re|ligious men: If they find at any time that he hath converted the lea&s;t part to his private u&s;e, he is <PB N="51" REF="30"> put to death in a mo&s;t cruel man|ner: He is &s;tript naked, and at the Door of the <HI>Marabut</HI> he is em|paled alive, and then in that man|ner rai&s;ed to the top of the Steeple of a <HI>Mo&s;quet,</HI> where he is expo&s;ed to Publick view for three daies; and then his Body is carried out of the City, to be given for food to the Wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>His E&s;tate is all &s;old for the be|nefit of the Religious Men; for they look upon it as con&s;ecrated to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> when the lea&s;t part of what belongs to him hath been mingled among&s;t it.</P>
<P>This People hath wi&s;ely provi|ded again&s;t their Covetou&s;ne&s;s &amp; di&s;orderly Behaviour, that rob or dimini&s;h from the Maintenance of tho&s;e Orders of Men that &s;erve the Publick in the Wor&s;hip of God, and that keep up the Honour of Religion among&s;t them; for they
<PB N="52" REF="31"> are &s;en&s;ible that the pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves and Goverment de|pends upon their e&s;teem, their Credit and Pro&s;perity, who only are able to per&s;wade men to &s;ub|mit to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws; there|fore there are here mo&s;t &s;evere Puni&s;hments inflicted upon all tho&s;e that venture to injure &s;uch either in their e&s;tates or Per&s;ons. And there is very good provi&s;ion made that they may not fall into the di&s;e&s;teem of the People.</P>
<P>There are excellent Orders to &s;tir them up to the Service of God: they are often &s;ummoned to Prayers; In the Morning, which time they call
<HI>Salam,</HI> at Twelve of the Clock, named <HI>Do|char,</HI> at Four in the Afternoon is their <HI>A&s;&s;ara;</HI> at Sun-&s;etting, <HI>Mog|harb;</HI> at Twilight, <HI>&V;&s;her;</HI> at Mid|night is <HI>Ou-el;</HI> the next is
<HI>I&s;tanay:</HI> At the&s;e &s;everal times great Num|bers
<PB N="53" REF="31"> of all &s;orts do re&s;ort to their <HI>Mo&s;quets,</HI> and there in an humble manner they pray to God and <HI>Ma|homet.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are negligent or carele&s;s in coming to Prayer, are taken notice of, and if they have been formerly Chri&s;tians, they are excluded from all hopes of Employment, and at the lea&s;t of|fence &s;everely treated.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies ob&s;erved in the Con&s;ecration of their Religi|ous Men are not unworthy of our Notice; The Father of the young man mu&s;t bring him to the <HI>Ma|rabut,</HI> when he &s;its in the Chief
<HI>Mo&s;quet</HI> of the City with a numorous Attendance, to be Wit|ne&s;&s;es of his Dedication to that Service. They enter the Place, the Father holding the Son by the Right hand, and both together go &s;traight to the <HI>Marabut,</HI> and ki&s;s <PB N="54" REF="32"> the Border of his Robe. After this Ceremony, the <HI>Marabut</HI> asks the Father whether he can read; the Father an&s;wers, Yes. A Book is immediately pre&s;ented to the young Fellow, u&s;ually the
<HI>Alcoran,</HI> who reads in it a Page: If he doth not mi&s;s a word, but pronounce well and di&s;tinctly, he is then ad|mitted: The <HI>Marabut</HI> calls him by his Name, and cau&s;eth it to be enrolled in the Catalogue of the Order: Then comes a Fellow with a &s;harp Knife, and cuts in his Right Arm the Figure of a half Moon; into the Wound is put &s;ome Gunpowder, which being blown up, leaves a blew Impre&s;&s;i|on, that nothing can take away, unle&s;s the place be cut off.</P>
<P>Afterwards &s;ome Prayers being made, tending to the Confirmation of him into their Holy Orders, he is obliged to &s;wear by <HI>Mahomets</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="32"> Lock of Hair to ob&s;erve certain Rules.</P>
<P>He is then cloathed in another manner before the People, and the
<HI>Marabut</HI> takes him into his Arms, and gives him a Ki&s;s, which &s;anctifies him for ever; the &s;olem|nity ends in Mu&s;ick and Dancing. This is practi&s;ed at their admit|tance into that Rank of Men which they e&s;teem holy, and who only may publickly read the <HI>Alcoran.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of their Mar|riages and Circumci&s;ions, their Cu&s;toms are not much different from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>I did ob&s;erve many particulars in the Happy time of my Slavery, for I had liberty to view the City, and to walk up and down; my bu&s;ine&s;s and work was only to wait upon my Lady at the time of her Devotions, &s;ometimes it was at <HI>Moghar,</HI> and &s;ometimes <PB N="56" REF="33"> in the Day at <HI>Dochar.</HI> I did di&s;|cover my &s;elf to her, and told her of the happine&s;s of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Life in our Countrey; I laboured to per&s;wade her to e&s;cape out of the old Mans reach; I promi&s;ed my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that if &s;he would con&s;ent unto it, I ingaged my &s;elf to her to Marry her. She had two Children, a Boy and a Girl, that kept her in that place, otherwi&s;e I think I had then got my Freedom and carryed her a|way; but &s;he would not for that cau&s;e hearken to my per&s;wa&s;ions, nor &s;uffer me to talk of my Liber|ty, telling me, that I &s;hould want nothing whil&s;t I remained in that place, and in her &s;ervice; that if I rendred my &s;elf unworthy of it, by offering to run away, I &s;hould become the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all men.</P>
<P>I was ever after more humble <PB N="57" REF="33"> and dutiful, and was afraid &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover in me an inclina|tion to be gone.</P>
<P>During this time I received &s;e|veral Letters from <HI>Cadiz, Malaga,</HI> and other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factories, that mentioned my Redemption, but I could never expect to obtain it from my kind Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>About that time &s;he departed this Life, and left me &s;ufficient cau&s;e to lament: Another of the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Wives was &s;u&s;pected to have poy&s;oned her, becau&s;e the <HI>Sultan</HI> had conceived a greater Love for her, by rea&s;on of her con&s;tant Devotions, than for the other. Before her Death, about &s;ix moneths, &s;he was brought to Bed of a pretty little Girl, &s;ome|what whiter than ordinary; the old Fool thought him&s;elf to be the Father of it. I was once ad|mitted to &s;ee it; but now my
<PB N="58" REF="34"> Mi&s;tre&s;s was dead, I was left to the Misfortunes and Mi&s;eries of a &s;lavi&s;h Life. I was forced again to return to a hard Service, al|though her Goodne&s;s had labour|ed to free me; for &s;he &s;ent to the man at who&s;e hou&s;e I lay, being her Cou&s;in German, to &s;peak with him before her Death: She did then make him promi&s;e to give me my Relea&s;e after her Burial in re|quital of my good Service, and by her Gentlewoman &s;ent me a Pre|&s;ent of Gold, to a con&s;iderable va|lue, which I did not po&s;&s;e&s;s long. You may ea&s;ily imagine my grief to part with &s;o true a Friend: It was not a little increas'd when I perceiv'd the Fellow would not perform his Cou&s;ins reque&s;t; but in&s;tead of &s;ending me away, carri|ed me to the Market again to be &s;old. I did long expo&s;tulate the bu&s;ine&s;s with him, but could ne|ver <PB N="59" REF="34"> have other Rea&s;ons of his pro|ceeding but this, That I &s;hould not anger him for fear he &s;hould publi&s;h the My&s;tery, which would infallibly co&s;t me my Head.</P>
<P>I was forced to &s;ubmit to his un|ju&s;t plea&s;ure. He led me to the Market, and there I was &s;old for 300 Dollars; for I never made my &s;elf known to him; he always look'd upon me as a pitiful Fellow, unable to redeem my &s;elf.</P>
<P>My next Ma&s;ter was by Profe&s;|&s;ion a Gardener, he had me into his Orchards, and there with a good Cudgel he made me under|&s;tand a trade I never knew before. I endured much with him; for he gave me &s;uch great Tasks to per|form, that I was not able to hold out.</P>
<P>At the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure he threat|ned to &s;tab and kill me; therefore the fear of Death made me &s;eek <PB N="60" REF="35"> my efcape. I was &s;ometimes &s;ent to fetch Lime for a Building that he had in hand near the Sea-&s;hore. A Ve&s;&s;el was lately arrived from <HI>France,</HI> to redeem the Captives; it lay without the Mould.</P>
<P>At that time that I was on the Sand it was dusky, a
<HI>French</HI> man offered me his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I accept|ed of it, and went into his Boat; but I was di&s;covered before I could get off the Mould, and &s;ent back to my Ma&s;ter, that puni&s;hed me with a hundred blows on the Soles of my Feet, which rendred me uncapable for his Service many days.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon weary of my Com|pany, and &s;old me to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Renegado that came on board our Ship at our Arrival. I expected from him a kinder entertainment, but found le&s;s: He was cruel and &s;evere to me, he made me work <PB N="61" REF="35"> night and day. I often treated with him for my Ran&s;om, but found his Demands to be &s;o high, that I could not comply with him. He abus'd me mo&s;t &s;adly about five Moneths, and then Death de|livered me of his Tyranny.</P>
<P>His Executors &s;old me again a|mong&s;t his Goods and Chattels. I fell next inro the hands of an <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Renegado, named <HI>I&s;hmael Reiz,</HI> who was not kinder to me than my former Ma&s;ters; my Work was painful, my Diet mean, my Labour continual, and my Re|wards the Blows of a hard Cud|gel.</P>
<P>I could not &s;uffer long this Ser|vice; therefore I &s;ought to di&s;|plea&s;e my Patron, and make him &s;ell me to another.</P>
<P>He gave me next to an Officer of the Militia called <HI>Hally Hamez Reiz,</HI> who was &s;o well plea&s;ed <PB N="62" REF="36"> with my Per&s;on and Countenance, that he re&s;olved not to part with me for any Money. I offered un|to him 800 Dollars: He told me I &s;hould fir&s;t go with him in the Countrey, and at his return I &s;hould have liberty to be redeem'd if I behaved my &s;elf well.</P>
<P>At that time the <HI>Turks</HI> did &s;end out a &s;trong Army to gather the Contributions of the People, and to relieve <HI>Trem&s;en</HI> or
<HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> a &s;trong and populous City in the Country.</P>
<P>There is a Garri&s;on of <HI>Turks</HI> that are &s;ent every year to that place, and another that comes from thence; for as it is a great City, the Countrey round about do always &s;ubmit to tho&s;e that are Ma&s;ters of that Place. It concerns therefore the <HI>Turks</HI> to fortifie and pre&s;erve that City for them&s;elves again&s;t the Attempts of the <HI>A|rabs,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="36"> that are their deadly Ene|mies.</P>
<P>Having run through &s;o many &s;trange and unexpected Fortunes, I did not hope to meet with le&s;s Variety in this Expedition, in the which I was engaged among&s;t the re&s;t; my Ma&s;ter was a Comman|der of a hundred Men: He was very pa&s;&s;ionate and la&s;civious, ne|verthele&s;s Valiant; as I did after|wards learn.</P>
<P>We marched out in very good Order, with our Flying Colours and &s;ome few Field-Pieces very &s;mall.</P>
<P>The Army was compo&s;ed of Twelve Thou&s;and Men; Four Thou&s;and were to go We&s;tward, and gather the contributions along the Sea-Coa&s;t as far as <HI>Tetuan</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Fez:</HI> The next Four Thou&s;and were to march to|wards <HI>Tunis;</HI> and the third Four
<PB N="64" REF="37"> Thou&s;and were to enter into the Country.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Turks</HI> is to gather the Contributions upon the Inhabitants who do not pay wil|lingly; therefore they venture not among&s;t them but in great Numbers, well armed, able to op|po&s;e an Enemy, or prevent a &s;ud|den &s;urprizal. There is a Natu|ral Antipathy between them. The <HI>Moors</HI> that dwell in the Kingdom, and the <HI>Arabs</HI> do hate the <HI>Turks,</HI> becau&s;e they are imperious, and and becau&s;e they are obliged to pay unto them an yearly Tri|bute.</P>
<P>The time that the&s;e Armies &s;et forth was in <HI>June,</HI> the Harve&s;t, when the Corn was ripe and fit for u&s;e: then the Country was able to furni&s;h the yearly Revenue ei|ther in Corn or Money.</P>
<P>The Commander of the We|&s;tern <PB N="65" REF="37"> Circuit was
<HI>Abel Hamed Si|mon;</HI> of the Ea&s;tern were two Chieftains, <HI>Halac Rigla Reiz,</HI> an old Renegado of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Halec Sim Haly,</HI> a young Blade that had more Precipitation than Wi&s;dom; they met with many Mi&s;chances, as you &s;hall afterwards hear, and had it not been for our unexpected Approach, the whole Army had been cut in pieces.</P>
<P>Our Commander was a judici|ous man, but very unfortunate; cruel, bold and valiant, a great Enemy of the <HI>Arabs;</HI> his Name was <HI>Ben O&s;man Bucher,</HI> he had been a great Commander at Sea, and fought in many notable Encoun|ters again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, never with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s as in the Year 36. again&s;t a <HI>Portugue&s;e Caraque,</HI> near the I&s;land of <HI>Tenerifa,</HI> &s;ayling from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and bound for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> laden with very rich <PB N="66" REF="38"> Commodities to a great value. His &s;hare was &s;o con&s;iderable, that he was rai&s;ed from a poor and a mean E&s;tate to a good Fortune, and to the E&s;teem of the <HI>Divan;</HI> e&s;peci|ally becau&s;e the good Succe&s;s of that Fight was attributed to his Valour and Re&s;olution: For the <HI>Christians</HI> making a &s;tout re&s;i|&s;tance, the <HI>Turks</HI> were di&s;coura|ged from further Attempts, and not willing to continue their En|terprize longer, when he with his drawn Cymeter did compel &s;ome, and per&s;wade others to try again the <HI>Portuguez</HI> Courage, and &s;o by that means won the Ship, and brought great Riches into the Ci|ty: He was ever after highly e|&s;teemed, and employed in great Affairs where any danger or diffi|culty did appear. For that Rea|&s;on he commanded the Army that was to go the middle Circuit; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="38"> there are a &s;ort of People very valiant and &s;tout, that &s;ome|times make a &s;trong Re&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and when they &s;ee their advantage, they refu&s;e Tribute.</P>
<P>Our Army was compo&s;ed of Hor&s;e and Foot; a thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and Foot were num|bred at the Mu&s;ters, be&s;ides Slaves and Servants.</P>
<P>The Cavalry was compo&s;ed of <HI>Turks</HI> born, and
<HI>Moors</HI> that had quitted their Countreys intere&s;t to &s;erve them of
<HI>Argiers;</HI> and for the mo&s;t part they were Inhabi|tants of the City, and had there their Wives and Children.</P>
<P>The Infantry was made up of Renegado-Chri&s;tians, whereof there are &s;uch number in that place, that they bear all the &s;way and command both by Sea and Land. They are as Imperious o|ver the re&s;t as the
<HI>Janizaries</HI> in <PB N="68" REF="39"> <HI>Turky</HI> over the
<HI>Greeks,</HI> and the <HI>Mamalukes</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> were over the ancient Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divan</HI> is compo&s;ed of this &s;ort of men, who are mo&s;t skilful becau&s;e they are acquainted with the Affairs of
<HI>Europe,</HI> and better able to manage the Publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s relating to that part of the World, and to give Orders. Some of them do get va&s;t E&s;tates, others are mi&s;erable and poor, and there|fore are obliged to the meane&s;t Offices.</P>
<P>With this &s;trong Party we &s;et forward, and came to a Place the fir&s;t day called <HI>At&s;abah,</HI> at two Leagues di&s;tance from the Sea: It was a pretty little Town &s;ituate on the Decline of a plea&s;ant Hill, that was covered on the right hand with a Large Wood, extream Bu&s;hy, about two Miles in length. The Hou&s;es were more hand&s;om <PB N="69" REF="39"> than we could expect in a Coun+trey Village. About it were to be &s;een the Ruines of old Buildings that did only appear out of the Earth. A Chri&s;tian Renegado that had &s;tudied in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> informed me, that this place was named anciently <HI>Stilpeia,</HI> and that it had been an Epi&s;copal See in the time of the Chri&s;tian Churches.</P>
<P>The Chief man of the place was a <HI>Turk,</HI> retired from the Affairs and Noi&s;e of the City, here he was re&s;olved to &s;pend the re&s;t of his days, that were not very ma|ny; for I conceive he was above four&s;core.</P>
<P>We lodged that night about this little Town. Round about
<HI>Argeirs</HI> there are many &s;uch, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the place.</P>
<P>The next morning we marched by break of Day, and went five
<PB N="70" REF="40"> Leagues before we did re&s;t. We pa&s;&s;ed by the Tents of many <HI>A|rabs,</HI> who had gathered all their Corn. The Chief of every Fa|mily paid our Receiver in Dollars and Gold, whereof there is a great quantity all along the Sea-Coa&s;t. They informed our General that a &s;mall number of their Countrey|men were met together, and were re&s;olved to di&s;pute unto us the pa&s;|&s;age of a River.</P>
<P>This News made us &s;tand upon our Guards, and was the occa&s;ion of frequent Alarms given to our Camp; for at the &s;ight of a few Hor&s;emen, we did imagine the E|nemy to be at their Heels, and rea|dy to charge us.</P>
<P>This days Journey was very plea&s;ant; for although I had my Ma&s;ters Lance, and a Gun to car|ry on my Shoulder, our Victuals that we brought with us were not <PB N="71" REF="40"> yet &s;pent, the way was very good, and we had &s;everal Accidents that we met with, that gave us a great deal of &s;port; be&s;ides I had acco|&s;ted an <HI>Engli&s;h Turk,</HI> with whom I did entertain my &s;elf of the Af|fairs of our Nation; I found him de&s;irous to &s;eek his e&s;cape, becau&s;e he had not lighted upon &s;o good a Fortune as others in their Apo&s;ta|&s;ie, and becau&s;e he had been put by an Employment that he had &s;ought after; and I think his Con&s;cience did a little trouble him to have ob&s;cured that Truth that he knew to be &s;o; therefore when I took the liberty to lay it before his Eyes, he could not re|&s;train his Tears.</P>
<P>Our General had no difficulty this day; for &s;everal came and brought in at the place appointed theit u&s;ual Tribute. The Inhabi|tants are &s;o near the City, and have <PB N="72" REF="41"> &s;o great a dependency upon it, that they are affraid to di&s;oblige it in the lea&s;t. Therefore when tho&s;e other people that were in Arms, did think to revolt from the
<HI>Turks,</HI> they &s;ent &s;ome to &s;ollicite the&s;e to join with them. They did all wi&s;h to be delivered from the <HI>Turks</HI> Ti|ranny, but they were affraid to venture, becau&s;e their near Habi|tations were likely to &s;uffer fir&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> Vengeance and Fury.</P>
<P>The Country we found very fruitful of Corn and Fodder. As we pa&s;&s;ed by a Wood, we had the &s;ight of &s;everal Wild Bea&s;ts that returned from &s;eeking their Prey. Our Van-guard did &s;hoot at many of them; one of our Company, to &s;hew his Valour, met a Lion that advanc'd towards us, and with his Cymeter in his hand en|countred him: The &s;port almo&s;t co&s;t the Fellow his Life, for the <PB N="73" REF="41"> Lion was very &s;trong, and with his Paws he had twice &s;truck him down, the la&s;t time the Lion in a rage had bit off part of his Arm; he had in&s;tantly devoured him, had not we all &s;hot at him, &amp; fixed above 100 Bullets in his Body. The Fellow we found almo&s;t dead with fear, under the Lion. He was glad with the lo&s;s of &s;ome of his Fle&s;h, to be &s;o happily e&s;cap'd; none pitied him, or was &s;orry for his wounds, his ra&s;h Enterprize did de&s;erve no le&s;s.</P>
<P>We journeyed about three Leagues, and we came to a little Valley very fruitful of Palms and Olive Trees, a &s;mall Rivulet, co|vered with Strawberry Bu&s;hes, did run through it, and water the Plain; at each end a Grove did grow.</P>
<P>In one, as we pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;aw a Flying Serpent, about the
<PB N="74" REF="42"> bigne&s;s of an ordinary Dog, with a long Tail, and a Head like an Ape, with a larger mouth, and a long Tongue, the Body had about four Foot in length; we &s;hot at it, but could not kill it: It threat|ned &s;ome of our men when they ventured to come near it, and could not be obliged to depart un|til a great number of us were arri|ved at the Place. I &s;aw it near a plea&s;ant Fountain that did ri&s;e in one &s;ide of the furthermo&s;t Grove. I enquired of the Name, but could not learn it; it had Wings of di|vers Colours, the chief were Red and White: It hovered long o|ver our heads, and had not the Noi&s;e of our Guns frighted it a|way, I think it had ventured a|mong&s;t us again. I could not di&s;|tingui&s;h of what &s;ub&s;tance the Wings were; they were bigger than tho&s;e of our winged Fowls; <PB N="75" REF="42"> all the Birds that &s;aw it at a di|&s;tance were glad to fly. I imagi|ned it to be a kind of Ba&s;ilisk, a de&s;perate Serpent, and extraordi|nary Venomous. This &s;ight was no le&s;s wonderful to the re&s;t than to me; for all profe&s;&s;ed to have never &s;een the like: That made me believe it was &s;ome In-land Creature not u&s;ually &s;een near the Sea-Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We met in this Journey nothing el&s;e remarkable, but &s;ome Ancient Pillars of Marble; upon one I &s;aw &s;ome <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters; A
<HI>Moor</HI> told me that they &s;ignified the Name of a great Commander that won a Battel fighting again&s;t the Inhabitants, when he led the
<HI>Ara|bians</HI> into that Country, <HI>I</HI> Zidi Dockra Moukadem <HI>under the Re|nowned General and Prince</HI> Abel Hamed, <HI>do erect this Pillar in me|mory of a great Victory obtained of <PB N="76" REF="43"> the</HI> Brabbers,
<HI>in the which I kill'd their Commander with my own Hands, who&s;e Name was</HI> Azoret Moudem; <HI>he was followed by</HI> 6000 <HI>Stout Souldiers; I had only</HI> 2000 <HI>of my Countrey-men; but our good Prophet would not &s;uffer us to be op|pre&s;t by his Enemies; he lent us a favourable A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in one hours time we de&s;troyed</HI> 3582 <HI>with the lo&s;s of</HI> 37 <HI>of my Men, and of the</HI> Hageria 130.</P>
<P>About a League farther we met with &s;everal Heaps of Stones, and near unto them, in the way &s;ide, a large Cave, into the which, with my Ma&s;ters Leave, I entered: It was hewn out of a Rock, there were &s;everal Chambers about five Foot broad, and as many long; there was nothing remarkable but &s;everal heaps of Bones: It &s;eems the Wild Bea&s;ts did make it their Retreat when they had &s;eized on <PB N="77" REF="43"> their Prey. I imagined it to be a Place made for the Dwelling of &s;ome &s;olitary <HI>Anachoret</HI> of the Pri|mitive Chri&s;tians, retired out of the World into that remote place. That which confirmed me in this Belief, was a great Number of Cro&s;&s;es and Crucifixes artificially made in the Rock, in the inner Chamber, which had no other Light but that which entered in by Reflections from the Caves Mouth through the other Rooms. I had only time to look upon this Religious Place; for the coming up of the Rear ha&s;tened me away. That Night we reach'd as far as <HI>Boumelli,</HI> a good Town &s;ituate upon a River &s;ide, very plea&s;ant becau&s;e of the Medows that did encompa&s;s it, and &s;everal little Hills that were to be &s;een afar off, crowned with Orange and Limon Trees that are always green in <PB N="78" REF="44"> tho&s;e Countries. The Inhabitants furni&s;hed us with all things nece&s;|&s;ary, and when our Army began to approach, they came in a very humble manner to pay homage to our Commander in Chief; the <HI>Shack</HI> of the Place went in the Head of them on foot, and ki&s;s'd the Hem of our Generals Garment, and pre&s;ented unto him a Basket full of Loaves, two white Cows, and half a dozen young Barbs. The Pre&s;ent was accepted, and they were confirmed in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their Lands.</P>
<P>There were in the Town about 600 Hou&s;es or Huts; &s;ome were pretty con&s;iderable, and adorned with Marble Pillars, and good Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>They were mo&s;t Graziers; for we found hereabouts &s;everal Droves of Cattel very fat.</P>
<P>The Country People informed <PB N="79" REF="44"> us of the De&s;ign of the <HI>Arabs</HI> to re&s;i&s;t us: They were gathered to|gether beyond the River <HI>Talna,</HI> where they were re&s;olved to try the Fortune of a Battel: All their Sub&s;tance they had tran&s;ported to the Top of a high Mountain, cal|led by the Inhabitants <HI>Azar,</HI> unto which they were re&s;olved to flee, if they did lo&s;e the Day.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of their Revolt, as was pretended, was the
<HI>Turks</HI> Ty|ranny, the Poverty of the Year not able to furni&s;h for their own Livelihood, and for the Tribute demanded from them; therefore they had made ha&s;te to gather up the Corn, and had prepared them|&s;elves to make re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This kind of People did not want a Re&s;olution to fight, nor good Conduct in the management of their Affairs; for they had di&s;|patch'd away &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers <PB N="80" REF="45"> into the Neigbouring Countries for Aid, and had drawn a great com|pany to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Our General gave notice of all things to the other Armies, that they might draw towards him, if Occa&s;ion did require it: Never|thele&s;s he proceeded in his March, and did &s;end every day &s;everal Parties of Hor&s;e from the main Body to receive the Offerings of the People.</P>
<P>The third day, which was ac|cording to our Account the 20th of
<HI>June,</HI> we pa&s;t over high Moun|tains fenced on all &s;ides with crag|gy Rocks; we were obliged &s;ome|times to climb over them: Our Hor&s;e took a compa&s;s about by a way more ea&s;ie.</P>
<P>About Noon the Sun was extra|ordinary hot, which obliged us to &s;eek a Repo&s;e under the &s;hady Trees that grew in this Stony
<PB N="81" REF="45"> ground; as I was re&s;ting my &s;elf at a di&s;tance from my Patrons Company, a great Scorpion &s;pies me in her way, and as I was be|tween &s;leeping and waking, the venomous Creature fixed her &s;ting in my naked Leg &s;o gently that I had not felt it, had not my next Neighbour adverti&s;ed me. I had heard much of that Bea&s;t; when I &s;aw my &s;elf wounded by it, and my fle&s;h &s;welling, immediately I began to fear the increa&s;e of the Venom, but &s;ome had already kil|led it, and brought the Blood un|to me to apply to the Wound. It was wonderful to &s;ee the pre&s;ent cure that the Blood gave; it had no &s;ooner touch'd the tumor, but it began to decrea&s;e, and out of the little prick came forth a Li|quor white as Milk, by that I found that the blood of the Scor|pion hath an attractive virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="46">I had no &s;ooner e&s;caped this Mi&s;chief, but I fell into a wor&s;e; my Ma&s;ter had &s;ent me to the Rear to buy Victuals for him&s;elf; for there were &s;ome in that place that did &s;ell Bread and Meat ready dre&s;s'd: As I was returning load|ed, I fell down with my burden a &s;teep Rock, and brui&s;ed my &s;elf; but the fear le&s;t my Ma&s;ter &s;hould cudgel me for my Misfortune, rouzed me up, and made me &s;peed towards him.</P>
<P>From this unhappy place we removed up Hill through a Coun|trey that was not inhabited, un|le&s;s it be by Mon&s;ters and Wild Bea&s;ts, whereof we &s;aw a great many; &s;ome not known to me be|fore.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the De&s;ign of our Ge|neral was to &s;urprize the
<HI>Arabian</HI> Army on a &s;udden, and to come upon them by a way that they lea&s;t <PB N="83" REF="46"> &s;u&s;pected. We marched here through Woods, over Rocks and Hills three days together. I had the &s;atisfaction for my pains to &s;ee &s;everal Creatures; of which I &s;hall give a brief Account.</P>
<P>This Mountain is part of the <HI>At|las,</HI> it runs all along through this Kingdom, and that of <HI>Fez,</HI> and reaches as far as the main Ocean; &s;ome part of it is very high.</P>
<P>We came to a place in this hot time of Summer, which was very cold: In the Corners that were not expo&s;ed to the Sun was a great deal of Ice and Snow. This place which gave us a Pro&s;pect over all the Countrey, was in the &s;econd Region of the Air.</P>
<P>Here we found plenty of woods and Trees, and &s;everal &s;orts of Birds; one we did kill that had four Legs as a Bea&s;t: Its Body was as big as a Turkie-Cock, the <PB N="84" REF="47"> Head was like an Owl, its Tail was extream broad, the Plumes were grey, and the Head only black; it did not fly very &s;wiftly, therefore our people had not much difficulty to kill it.</P>
<P>We &s;aw &s;everal &s;orts of Lions; towards the Evening they did go out of their Dens, when the <HI>Jac|kals</HI> began to bark.</P>
<P>The noble&s;t &s;ort of Lion is that which is called the
<HI>Royal;</HI> it is the bigge&s;t and the &s;trong&s;t &s;ort; it hath a Shape &s;omewhat differing from the re&s;t, and a Voice more &s;tout: When any of the others do meet &s;uch an one, they &s;eem to yield a re&s;pect unto him. He is more grave in his Motion, more fierce in the Encounter, undaunt|ed in the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>There are other &s;orts of a le&s;&s;er Size. Every night we were vi&s;it|ed with &s;everal Companies of wild <PB N="85" REF="47"> Creatures; &s;ome had the bold|ne&s;s to break in upon us, but the&s;e never returned again to their com|pany to tell News.</P>
<P>In an Evening we di&s;covered a|far off a great Bea&s;t; &s;ome of us went nearer to it to di&s;charge our Guns at it: It was a Mon&s;ter of a large Bulk, the Head was like a Lion, the Paws like a Bear, the hinder parts much like to an A&s;s; when it was killed, every one in the Army had a &s;ight of it; I then did remember the Saying of the <HI>Romans, Africa &s;emper apportat ali|quid novi;</HI> every year there is &s;ome &s;trange Creature or other to be &s;een in the&s;e remote places.</P>
<P>Some make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to watch them at the Sea&s;on of the Year that they u&s;ually come into the World, and employ all their Art to catch them, that they might lead them from place to place a|live,
<PB N="86" REF="48"> to &s;hew them to the Inhabi|tants for money.</P>
<P>There are here a great number of wild Goats, we had the &s;ight of &s;ome that climbed up the &s;teepy Rocks, but could not come with|in Shot of them.</P>
<P>Another Creature I &s;aw here much like unto a Dog, very nim|ble and quick &s;ighted, but yield|ing an extraordinary &s;tink; it is called by the Moore <HI>Sub&s;ib.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another of the &s;ame &s;hape, only this diffe|rence, that it hath a white Tail, and adventures in the night a|mong&s;t the Inhabitants to &s;teal the Good-wives Hens and Gee&s;e; it is called
<HI>Thaloub;</HI> it is of the na|ture of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foxes, very &s;ubtil and crafty.</P>
<P>I &s;aw here in this wild place &s;e|veral other &s;orts of Serpents and Bea&s;ts, of which I could not come <PB N="87" REF="48"> near to take a full view, therefore I &s;hall not adventure to de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot one of a &s;trange Nature; it appear'd unto us as a White Lamb, &s;omething differing in the &s;hape, as we were marching through a Valley; but when it perceived us to approach in &s;uch Numbers, it fled before us; our Captain thought it had been &s;ome &s;tragling Lamb belong|ing to &s;ome Mountainous People, and becau&s;e we were not well pro|vided with good Victuals, he &s;ent &s;ome of us to overtake it before it got into the neighbouring thick|ets of a ri&s;ing Hill: I had Order to pur&s;ue it, and accompany the Hunters. As we came within a hundred Paces of it, it made more ha&s;te than ordinary, and began to &s;hift for it &s;elf among&s;t the Trees; but as it could not well e&s;cape <PB N="88" REF="49"> from us, becau&s;e it was already weary, and very fat, we overtook it at the entry in of the Bu&s;hes; but perceiving us &s;o near, it ran under one, and that we might not find it, it changed in an in&s;tant its white colour into the &s;ame with the Bu&s;h, which unexpected alte|ration gave us a great deal of trou|ble. We had never found it a|gain, had not one of the Compa|ny di&s;charged a Musket; at the Noi&s;e it ro&s;e up in a fright, and began to run for its Life; we lit|tle thought it to be the &s;ame, ne|verthele&s;s &s;ome of us did venture after it, and &s;ome remained in the place, &s;eeking the white Bea&s;t: The Pur&s;uers &s;hot off one of its Legs, and then cried to us to for|bear &s;eeking, and that the coun|terfeit Lamb was caught. We went to be Eye witne&s;&s;es of the Wonder; it was the &s;ame &s;hap'd <PB N="89" REF="49"> Bea&s;t, but the colour was no more White as before, the Milky Colour was changed into a Black|i&s;h Gray: Its Coat was a fine Wool, the Head was like a Wolf, not altogether &s;o long, it had ve|ry &s;harp Teeth, and a fierce Look, the Hinder-parts were like a Sheep: It is one of the &s;trange&s;t Creatures I ever &s;aw. I wondred how it could alter its White Wool into a Colour &s;o different: I imagined this to be the Bea&s;t mentioned by the Learned, that takes the Colour of the place where it lays; a good Emblem of an Hypocrite.</P>
<P>We &s;pent three days climbing over the&s;e mountainous places, and fighting with &s;trange and un|known Creatures to me: But as this was not the bu&s;ine&s;s we inten|ded, we made ha&s;te into the plain Countrey; our Hor&s;e and Car|riages <PB N="90" REF="50"> we had &s;ent by another way, a little about, &s;o we arrived at the Pa&s;&s;age of the River before them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;lept in great &s;ecu|rity, little thinking that we would adventure over the Mountains and Rocks.</P>
<P>Our General Commanded us to re&s;t, and fit our &s;elves for Action, for he imagined, that a&s;&s;oon as we &s;hould come into the Plain, our arrival would be known to the Enemies, and that they would not fail to make Attempts upon us on a &s;uddain. We refre&s;hed our &s;elves all that Evening, until the next Morning, when an Alarum was &s;ounded, at the which we all ran to our Arms, and put our &s;elves in order, expecting the On|&s;et of &s;ome
<HI>Arabs,</HI> but no Enemy appeared, unle&s;s it was a company of Apes pur&s;ued by a few Jaccals, <PB N="91" REF="50"> who made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the Wood that was near us, running up and down the Branches, that tho&s;e upon the skirts of the Army thought them to be the Enemy, that took the advantage of the place to fire upon us; their need|le&s;s Fear did a&s;&s;oon appear as the nimble Creatures recover'd the tops of the highe&s;t trees, to who&s;e protection they did dare to com|mit them&s;elves; neverthele&s;s the Allarm continued, and ran, as nimbly as the Apes, all over the Army, it could not be &s;topt until every one was informed of the cau&s;e of the Fright.</P>
<P>We Marched all that Morning until Noon, and then came to the foot of the Hills, where our Ge|neral was re&s;olved to &s;tay till E|vening, intending with a Party at Midnight to fall upon the Ene|my, who was not above &s;ix Miles <PB N="92" REF="51"> di&s;tance from us: as it began to dawn, we advanc'd, and found &s;ome few Tents &s;tragling from the re&s;t; the
<HI>Arabs</HI> that were in them, told us that the main Body was at the Ford of the River <HI>Tafna,</HI> ex|pecting our Arrival; that they had broken down all the Bridges all along, and were re&s;olved to fight us; they further informed us of the cau&s;e of their Revolt: A Per&s;on of a Noble Family of one of their Tribes, named <HI>I&s;ha Muker,</HI> who&s;e Parents had been very con|&s;iderable in the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> was that year come among&s;t them, with all his Sub&s;tance; that he was look'd upon as an Eminent Commander, skilful in Affairs of War and Peace, and that he was therefore well received, becau&s;e al&s;o that he was very rich; That this was the man had per&s;waded them to &s;hake off the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> yoke.
<PB N="93" REF="51"> At fir&s;t they were timorous and fearful to revolt; but at la&s;t he en|couraged them, by repre&s;enting how imperious they were, the po|verty of the Year, that could not furni&s;h the Tribute-Money, and to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tency. Be&s;ides he told them that the <HI>Turks</HI> were not true
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> that they were He|retical in their Opinions, and pro|phane in their Practices, and that it was not lawful to &s;ubmit to, and own &s;uch for their Ma&s;ters. The&s;e Rea&s;ons had work'd upon the mul|titude, but could not cau&s;e them to take up Arms until he had ad|vis'd him&s;elf of this Stratagem; A Fellow was lately come into tho&s;e Parts from <HI>Mecha,</HI> and feigned to be lame; His Pilgrimage was much more e&s;teemed becau&s;e of the pretended Impediment of his Feet.</P>
<P>Before he was arrived, <HI>Elm&s;war <PB N="94" REF="52"> Tapnez,</HI> for that was the Noble Mans Name, had &s;ufficiently in|&s;tructed him how he &s;hould behave him&s;elf: He brought with him a Letter which was directed to the Chief Leading men of the Coun|trey, from the Keeper of
<HI>Maho|met</HI>'s Temple; the Contents were, That <HI>Mahomet</HI> had appear'd unto him in a Dream, and commanded him to &s;ignifie unto them that it was his Plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;i&s;t them this year in a notable manner, and free them from the Slavery of the <HI>Turk:</HI> It promi&s;ed be&s;ides the re|wards of Heaven to tho&s;e that &s;hould be valiant, and eternal pu|ni&s;hment to the Cowards and Di&s;|obedient.</P>
<P>This Letter was given almo&s;t at the &s;ame time to the Grandees, and divulged all abroad among&s;t the <HI>Arabs</HI> in the Kingdom; &s;ome did give credit to it, others did look <PB N="95" REF="52"> upon it as an Impo&s;ture. Never|thele&s;s an A&s;&s;embly was called of the Chief of them, where the Letter being again produc'd in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Tapnez,</HI> the
<HI>Hage</HI> or Religious Pilgrim &s;eeing him come in, fell on his Face and ki&s;s'd the hem of his Garment; the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ants wondred at this humility, not u&s;ual in per&s;ons of that Holy Or|der, until he had told them the Cau&s;e: He affirmed that the Great Prophet had appeared that night unto him, and in con&s;ideration of his great pains he had &s;uffered in his Travels to <HI>Meccha,</HI> he would cure him of his Lamene&s;s, that he had &s;hew'd him the Per&s;on in his &s;hape that &s;hould lay his hand up|on him and cure him, and that it was this &s;ame man that was pre|&s;ent: <HI>Tapnez</HI> &s;eem'd to increa&s;e the number of the Wonderers, and would not be per&s;waded the Re|velation <PB N="96" REF="53"> had been real, until the
<HI>Hage</HI> or Holy Man with all the A&s;|&s;embly earne&s;tly reque&s;ted him to try what he was able to do: At la&s;t he con&s;ented to their Prayers, and with his Right Hand began to &s;troke the Lame man.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner felt the others &s;in|ger, but he began to leap, and falling at his Feet, adored him as a Holy Man.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly taking notice of the Cure, and the manner of it, did really believe the <HI>Hage,</HI> and without delay e&s;tabli&s;hed
<HI>Tapnez</HI> for their General and Chief Com|mander, until they could give no|tice of their De&s;ignes to &s;ome of the Blood-Royal of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who only may command over them as King or Emperor. It was then re|&s;olved al&s;o that they would no longer pay Tribute to the <HI>Turk: Tapnez</HI> confirmed his Credit by <PB N="97" REF="53"> many other feigned Miracles; &s;o that he was look'd upon in the the Countrey as &s;ome extraordina|ry Fellow &s;ent from Heaven to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>He had gathered together thir|teen thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot; the Countrey People reported more: and with this Army was re&s;olved to wait for the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army that came that way to ga|ther Contributions, and to relieve the Garri&s;on of <HI>Chin&s;an</HI> or <HI>Tremi|&s;en,</HI> a City in the middle of the Countrey, not inferiour to <HI>Fez.</HI></P>
<P>The Numbers of our Enemies did &s;tartle us when we heard how they were re&s;olved to revenge them&s;elves for all pa&s;t Affronts; therefore the Commanders did de|&s;ire the General not to expo&s;e them to &s;o eminent a danger until the other Armies had joined with him.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="54">His Courage was great, he could not yield to this whol&s;om advice; his Hopes were greater: He was re&s;olved to get all the ho|nour of the Victory to him&s;elf; therefore he propo&s;ed to fall upon the
<HI>Arabs</HI> that night; he &s;hewed it to his Captains, to per&s;wade them, what an ea&s;ie thing it was to rout the Enemy that was &s;o &s;e|cure, and that had not any no|tice of their Approach; and that unle&s;s they did &s;peedily make u&s;e of the Opportunity, the Hor&s;e and Baggage would be delivered into the Hands of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who&s;e Numbers were able to op|pre&s;s the &s;mall Party that came di|rectly that way. It was too late to go back, we were now &s;o near, that unle&s;s we did &s;urprize the E|nemy, it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;|cape.</P>
<P>According to our Generals Or|ders, <PB N="99" REF="54"> as it began to dawn, we march'd with all &s;peed into the Plain along the River, and about two or three hours in the night we came within the Noi&s;e of the Peo|ple in the Tents.</P>
<P>Our General divided us into three Parties, appointing over each a skilful Leader, an <HI>Acha Ba|&s;ha,</HI> and commanded that we &s;hould fall upon the <HI>Arabs</HI> in three places.</P>
<P>Out of the Main Body he had &s;eparated a certain number to &s;ei&s;e on certain &s;tragling Hor&s;es which might be feeding about the Camp; The&s;e he intended to employ in ca&s;e he put the Army to flight.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as we came within a quarter of a Mile of the Enemy, we found a &s;mall Party lodged in a hundred Tents, which we &s;ur|rounded according to our Orders. We killed all that we found alive,
<PB N="100" REF="55"> with very little noi&s;e. In the Me|dows and by the Bank of the Ri|ver great Companies of Hor&s;es were taken for our u&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the&s;e Tents had been placed to guard them from Moun|tainers or Wild Bea&s;ts: Our Ge|neral made very good u&s;e of them in the Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion of the Rebels, for he cau&s;ed them to be mounted by &s;ome of his own Party, and commanded them to pur&s;ue the Enemy.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as we came to the fir&s;t Tents, we fell upon them without Mercy, and did great Execution. The two other Parties entred the Camp by &s;everal ways, having fetch'd a Compa&s;s about; we found no re&s;i&s;tance until we came to the middle of the Tents.</P>
<P>There was a large Spot of Ground unto which the <HI>Arabs</HI> did run together at the &s;ound of the <PB N="101" REF="55"> Alarm: They had not time to put them&s;elves in a good Order; therefore at the third Volley of Shot they began to di&s;per&s;e, and to &s;hift for them&s;elves by divers ways. The two other Parties met &s;everal Companies of them, which they either kill'd or took Pri&s;oners. The mo&s;t of them re|covered their Hor&s;es, and fled for their Lives.</P>
<P>Our &s;mall Party of Hor&s;e was not idle in the mean whiles; they ven|tur'd after the Enemy with more Noi&s;e, than Ability to do harm.</P>
<P>In the dark their Numbers could not be well di&s;cerned; but this hindred them from viewing us the next day; for knowing that we had both Hor&s;e and Foot, they would not hazard them&s;elves near us, until they had been informed by &s;ome Runaways of our &s;mall Numbers.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="56">They fled to the next Hills, where all their Sub&s;tance had been &s;tored.</P>
<P>The Plunder of the Camp was but &s;mall; &s;uch things we found that Beggars would &s;carce lift from under their Feet; a few na&s;ty Tents we erected of &s;uch pitiful Stuff that I never &s;aw the like. It &s;eems the
<HI>Arabs</HI> delight not in rich Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, but in numbers of Sheep and Camels.</P>
<P>Some few Hor&s;es fell into our hands the next day.</P>
<P>In this Attempt we lo&s;t about 50 men, and 435 of the
<HI>Arabians</HI> were kill'd in and about the Camp. Our General found in &s;ome of the Tents Letters &s;ent from the <HI>Arabi|ans</HI> in the other Kingdoms, to en|courage the&s;e to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Power, promi&s;ing all a&s;&s;i&s;tance that they could furni&s;h: For fear there|fore that the Enemy &s;hould receive <PB N="103" REF="56"> from their Neighbours and Bre|thren &s;uch Supplies as &s;hould en|courage them to revenge them|&s;elves, and for fear we &s;hould lo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of the River, which was of &s;o great importance to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Affairs and De&s;igns, our General and his Council re&s;olved to fortifie them&s;elves on both &s;ides in the be&s;t manner that the place would permit; and with all &s;peed to di&s;patch away &s;ome Me&s;|&s;engers to the other Armies, to ha|&s;ten them in their March to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; for he knew him&s;elf un|able to encounter the
<HI>Arabs,</HI> or to proceed in his De&s;igns and March towards
<HI>Chin&s;an</HI> with his &s;mall Number.</P>
<P>Three Trenches were drawn on the Enemies &s;ide, and one on the other. There we thought our &s;elves &s;ecure; for the Enemies Hor&s;e were not able to come to us, <PB N="104" REF="57"> their Foot were poor and mi&s;era|ble, ten of them do not dare to look a <HI>Turk</HI> in the Face.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Place did favour our Enterprize; for the Ground on both &s;ides is higher than the re&s;t at the Ford. The River is deep in all other places, and runs in a narrow Channel; but when it comes there, it &s;preads it &s;elf, finding more Elbow room: The Ri&s;ing Ground forces it to run in a larger Stream, and then again the Water is confin'd to a le&s;&s;er Channel; &s;o that only in this place we may pa&s;s on foot without fear of Drowning.</P>
<P>Two days after the Battel, our Cavalry and Baggage came &s;afe to us, although they had been met by &s;everal Parties of <HI>Arabs,</HI> and forced to skirmi&s;h many times.</P>
<P>By this new Supply our Cou|rages began to encrea&s;e; we were
<PB N="105" REF="57"> better able to re&s;i&s;t our Enemies Attempts in ca&s;e they &s;hould be &s;o bold as to force our weak Fortifi|cations,</P>
<P>We lay not long in this Po&s;ture, before we &s;aw many re&s;olute Par|ties of Hor&s;e and Foot daring us out to Battel. They began to contemn tho&s;e that they formerly feared, when they knew our num|bers: Every Night we had two or three Alarms given unto us.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day after the arri|val of our Cavalry, a &s;trong Par|ty of Hor&s;e rid within Musket|&s;hot of us, calling us Cowards and Hereticks. Our Generals Cou|rage could not &s;uffer long the&s;e &s;mall Affronts unpuni&s;hed, there|fore he commanded the Cavalry to ha&s;ten out and to charge them &s;toutly. It was a &s;ad Enterprize to many of them; above a thou|&s;and went out, but &s;carce five <PB N="106" REF="58"> hundred came back again. The cau&s;e of their Defeat was this; At the fir&s;t Charge the Enemy re|treats in good Order; but when the <HI>Turks</HI> gave another On&s;et, they ran away, only with a De&s;ign to draw us by that feigned flight far from the Main Body, and into a &s;trong Ambu&s;cado that was hid be|hind a Hill about a Mile from the River: Our men perceived not the De&s;ign, but with more ha&s;te than good &s;peed pur&s;ued them without con&s;ideration of the dan|ger.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as they were pa&s;t the place, a good Company of Foot &s;alutes them with a Volley of &s;hot on the left hand, and then the Ambu&s;cado of Hor&s;e ri&s;es on the Right, at the &s;ame time the pur&s;u|ed Party turns their backs, and our poor men were &s;urrounded, di&s;ordered, and killed like &s;o ma|ny <PB N="107" REF="58"> Sheep: Had they not had a &s;tout Commander to lead them on and bring them off, they had all peri&s;hed in the place; for the un|equal Numbers of the Enemy did overpower them. About 500 e&s;|caped from the Slaughter.</P>
<P>This Misfortune did wonder|fully heighten the Courage of the
<HI>Arabians,</HI> and give Credit to their Arms.</P>
<P>It made our General more wary for the future, and prevented greater De&s;tructions which might have happened unto us, had we not been made wi&s;er by our Lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Enemy at &s;everal other times did endeavour again to catch us in the &s;ame Advantage; but our General was grown wary by Experience.</P>
<P>That the Spirits of his men might not be dejected, nor the
<HI>A|rabs</HI> <PB N="108" REF="59"> too proud of their Succe&s;s, he drew out both Hor&s;e and Foot, and put them in a readine&s;s to fight.</P>
<P>The Enemy came to look upon us; our Hor&s;e was &s;ent to take a view of them: They returned again after a light Skirmi&s;h, in which the Rebels had the wor&s;t. Every day we did encounter with them, &s;ometimes to our Advan|tage, &s;ometimes to our Lo&s;s. We lay not long in this place before we heard of the approach of the Ea&s;tern Army, Commanded by the two Generals. They had not met with any oppo&s;ition in their Cir|cuit, until they came within a days Journey of us; then a &s;trong Bo|dy of Hor&s;e oppo&s;es them, and forces them to &s;eek the &s;helter of a Hill, where they were better a|ble to receive the On&s;et of the <HI>A|rabians.</HI> It &s;eems they had heard
<PB N="109" REF="59"> of the March of that Army to|wards us, therefore to prevent our joining together, or rather to defeat them before they came up with us, a great number of them had &s;tollen over the River &s;ecret|ly, at a great di&s;tance from us, and had expected them in their way.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as this News came to our Camp, our General re&s;olved to meet them in per&s;on, leaving in the Fortifications a &s;ufficient num|ber to defend it, and the &s;ame ap|pearance of his being pre&s;ent. It was my Ma&s;ters and my Fortune to accompany the Army.</P>
<P>At a place called by the <HI>Arabi|ans Stefee,</HI> we came up with the Enemy: A Party of Hor&s;e char|ged us very &s;toutly with Lance &amp; Musket: Not many of ours were wounded, only four or five killed. They met with as &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, which forced them from us, not <PB N="110" REF="60"> without lo&s;s. Our Hor&s;e had the Cha&s;e of them a Mile. We did not dare to adventure again after them farther; be&s;ides, they were more nimble than ours, becau&s;e they had not been tired with &s;o long a Journey.</P>
<P>By this &s;mall Encounter and Vi|ctory we opened a way to our men that we found in no &s;mall di&s;tre&s;s for want of Provi&s;ions and things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>They could not proceed in their Journey for fear of the Enemy, that had had great advantage o|ver them.</P>
<P>We found them entrenched in a &s;trong place, in &s;uch a manner that all the <HI>Arabians</HI> were not a|ble to drive them from thence, un|le&s;s it were by Famine. They in|formed us of what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them; that the <HI>Arabians</HI> had beaten them twice, and kill'd
<PB N="111" REF="60"> above a Thou&s;and Men. The fir&s;t time they laid an Ambu&s;cado in their way, near a thick Wood, and when &s;ome Companies were pa&s;t the place they fell &s;uddainly upon them without mercy, and had not the Generals expo&s;ed their Per&s;ons to the Peril, and main|tained a Fight with the Victorious Enemy, until the others had ral|lyed again, they had been all ut|terly lo&s;t; for they were in &s;uch a di&s;order, that they killed one another to make way for to fly.</P>
<P>Our Men were po&s;&s;e&s;t with &s;o &s;trange a fear and apprehen&s;ion, that when our Vanguard came near the place, they imagined them to be the Enemy; their joy was no le&s;s than their fear, when they perceived their errour. They re|ceived us as their Protectors. We &s;upplyed them with all things that they wanted, and then Marched <PB N="112" REF="61"> back again to our Camp, unto which the other Army &s;oon arri|ved.</P>
<P>With this recruit it was re&s;ol|ved we &s;hould &s;tay no longer there, but beat up the Quarters of the Enemy: Accordingly the next day we Marched out Bag and Baggage, having left a &s;mall Guard in the place to keep it, to &s;ecure our pa&s;&s;age over again, in ca&s;e we &s;hould meet with the Misfortunes of War, which might oblige us to a Retreat.</P>
<P>At two Miles di&s;tance from the River, a &s;mall Party had the Courage to Charge us, but they would not &s;tand to it long. We Marched up the Hill with a great deal of Courage and Re&s;olution: Our men were &s;o enraged by their former Lo&s;&s;es, that they would not pardon any of the Enemy that fell by chance into their hands.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="61">This Mountain is called <HI>Houlah|ka;</HI> it is about ten miles round; it reaches very high; about it &s;e|veral Cottages are built, that &s;erve for habitation to the Natural In|habitants of this Country, the <HI>Moors;</HI> they are poor and needy for the mo&s;t part, they feed upon &s;uch things as grow wild in the Valley; for although this Moun|tain appears entire to the Behold|ers afar off, with a continued A&s;|cent, there are many Valleys in it, and it is compo&s;ed of &s;everal little Hills: The lower ground is ex|tream fruitful, watered with ma|ny plea&s;ant Fountains that poure down their &s;treams towards the River <HI>Tapna.</HI></P>
<P>This place is adorned with ma|ny goodly Trees and Woods, which as in mo&s;t places grow na|turally without planting, in that ground which hath not been late|ly <PB N="114" REF="62"> employed, whereof there is ve|ry much in the Land.</P>
<P>The Earth of it &s;elf abhors Idle|ne&s;s; when therefore it is neglect|ed by rea&s;on of the &s;mall Number of Inhabitants, or when it hath been long without employing its innate productive virtue, it then breaks forth into Trees &amp; Wood, as in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> is &s;ufficiently known: Our Plantations have been forc'd to make way for their Habitations with the Axe and the Saw, to hew down the Wood that did cover the Countrey; and in our I&s;land, as &s;ome ancient Wri|ters tell us, <HI>Cumberland</HI> and
<HI>We&s;t|merland,</HI> and all the Northern Parts of <HI>England</HI> were full of Woods, Trees and Bu&s;hes, e&s;pe|cially upon the Mountains, where &s;carce any Wood is now to be &s;een.</P>
<P>In this place the <HI>Arabians</HI> did <PB N="115" REF="62"> think to find a &s;afe Retreat; and the rather, becau&s;e there were not many Advenues to the Top: Na|ture had on all &s;ides fenced it, and di&s;tingui&s;hed it from the other Land by high and &s;teepy Rocks. Five Pa&s;&s;ages do lead into this Place; the large&s;t is a way about a hundred feet broad, in mo&s;t places covered on both &s;ides with Sandy Hills, Woods and Rocks that &s;eem to threaten the Pa&s;&s;en|ger.</P>
<P>The Entrance into this Place was &s;omewhat terrible unto us, not only becau&s;e of the nature of the Situation, but al&s;o becau&s;e the E|nemy had &s;eized upon all the dif|ficult places and pa&s;&s;ages to annoy us.</P>
<P>Our Generals were re&s;olved to beat them from thence, and to fight them in their Ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Both &s;ides of the way were li|ned <PB N="116" REF="63"> with Armed men, that did ca&s;t upon us Stones, Timber, and what&s;oever they could get. We defended our &s;elves with Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive Weapons, and made a way by the Sword, until we came to a very difficult Pa&s;&s;age: On both &s;ides were rai&s;ed two Bu&s;hy Woods, in which the Enemy were hid; when our men came near, they let fly again&s;t us &s;everal Volleys of Shot, which put us all to &s;tand. The <HI>A|rabians</HI> thought us to be amazed at this &s;udden oppo&s;ition, of which they intended to make ad|vantage, in an in&s;tant came thun|dring upon us before and behind, the &s;toute&s;t of them; &s;o that we were in no little trouble how to oppo&s;e them. Our Generals &s;ha|red among&s;t them&s;elves the dan|ger and the honour of the Victo|ry; they &s;eeing the craft and pow|er <PB N="117" REF="63"> of the
<HI>Arabians,</HI> &s;eparated them&s;elves, and turned their &s;e|veral Companies again&s;t the next Troops of the Enemy, and did &s;o hand&s;omly behave them&s;elves, and &s;o wi&s;ely manage their bu&s;ine&s;s, that the
<HI>Arabians</HI> were forced to leave us the Ma&s;ters of the Field, with the Victory. One thing did very much contribute to the ob|taining of it; not far from that place an ea&s;ie A&s;cent did lead to the other &s;ide of one of the woods, where the <HI>Arabians</HI> had &s;ecured them&s;elves: By this, one of our Generals &s;teals up, and falls upon the back of the Enemy, that thought next upon nothing but how to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight. Our men pur&s;ued their advantage, and left not their bu&s;ine&s;s half fini|ni&s;hed; they &s;eized upon the place, and drove the <HI>Arabians</HI> quite out of the Wood with great <PB N="118" REF="64"> &s;laughter. Their Fellows &s;eeing their di&s;order, and the Re&s;olu|tion of our Men, that would not retire back, imagined &s;ome &s;uch thing might happen on their &s;ide, therefore they all ran away; &s;o &s;trange a pa&s;&s;ion is Fear, that when Men are inclinable to it, the lea&s;t accident cau&s;eth them to tremble; all the World would not have been able to have beat them from this place, had they maintained it with re&s;olution; but the &s;ight of an Enemy behind, which they lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, frighted them a|way. They recovered the other &s;ide, where their Hor&s;es &s;tayed for them, and &s;o &s;aved them&s;elves from the
<HI>Turks</HI> Fury. They lo&s;t here a|bove 1500 Men. in the Valleys we found many hundred Head of Cat|tel, Sheep, Oxen, Cammels, and all &s;orts of Bea&s;ts, feeding in the Pa&s;tures: It was wonderful to us
<PB N="119" REF="64"> to meet with &s;uch a fruitful place in the mid&s;t of &s;o many Rocks and &s;uch barren Hills. For all the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es the
<HI>Arabians</HI> would not return to their former Obedience, but continued &s;till to re&s;i&s;t us: Our Camp did receive &s;everal A|larms, e&s;pecially in the Night, &s;o that we were all tired out with Watching.</P>
<P>Above three Weeks we were pur&s;uing the Enemy among&s;t the Hills, from one Hill to another: They did fly continually, and becau&s;e we were not &s;o &s;trong in Cavalry as they were, we did not dare to adventure again&s;t them, only with our Hor&s;e; our Foot were not able to pur&s;ue them &s;o fa&s;t as they did &s;ave them&s;elves: The Plunder that we did find in the&s;e places, did abundantly &s;atisfie for the yearly Tribute. The great numbers of Cattel that we got <PB N="120" REF="65"> into our hands, cau&s;ed the <HI>Arabi|ans</HI> to fall out among&s;t them&s;elves; which coming to our Ears, our Generals &s;ent a Flag of Truce, to invite them to &s;ubmit to the
<HI>Turks</HI> Empire; a part of them accepted the offer of Peace, and came in to us; the others with their Cap|tain was &s;aid to have fled away, &s;o that meeting with none to op|po&s;e us, we received &s;ome Ho&s;ta|ges from the Enemy; and becau&s;e their Lo&s;&s;es had been great, our Generals would not exact from them any other Tribute, than what they had recovered by force of Arms. They had full liberty to return to their former abode, upon condition that they would Manure the Ground, and pay unto them of <HI>Argiers</HI> their u&s;ual Tribute-money; they promi&s;ed to be alwaies obedient to the Grand Seignior, and to the City <PB N="121" REF="65"> of <HI>Argeirs;</HI> afterwards they were di&s;mi&s;t: There were about 1600 Families that did return to their Duty with all their Leaders.</P>
<P>Our Army took another way out of the&s;e Mountains than we came. No Enemy appear'd all the way, until we came to a nar|row pa&s;&s;age between two high Hills; the way was a difficult A&s;|cent: Here we found it &s;topt up in &s;uch a manner that no Hor&s;e could pa&s;s. Before we imagined our bu&s;ine&s;s had been done, when we &s;aw &s;o many of the revolted
<HI>A|rabians</HI> return to their Obedience; it did not therefore a little &s;ur|prize us, when we found &s;o many left to oppo&s;e us at this Pa&s;&s;age, it was not po&s;&s;ible for us to come near: Several of our Companies did endeavour to &s;torm the place, but the Enemy was &s;o &s;trongly fortified on all &s;ides, and &s;o well <PB N="122" REF="66"> furni&s;hed with Weapons, that we were forced to &s;it down and con|&s;ider what to do: A Council was called of all the Commanders, where it was re&s;olved not to go back or &s;eek any other pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e if they did leave &s;uch a powerful Enemy unpuni&s;hed, and on foot in the heart of the King|dom, it might very much en|danger their intere&s;t there; for a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould be gone, they would endeavour to corrupt the re&s;t, and draw them from their Allegiance, either by force or fair means; be&s;ides, they did con&s;ider that they that had &s;ubmitted unto them, were forced unto it, and that they were as inclinable to &s;tand out as the&s;e, were there any hopes of pro&s;pering in their oppo&s;ition again&s;t us; and that it would be no &s;mall Di&s;grace to a victorious Army to be overcome by a van|qui&s;h'd <PB N="123" REF="66"> Enemy: the lea&s;t News of this would be able to encourage the re&s;t of the
<HI>Turks</HI> Subjects to revolt: For the&s;e and many other Rea&s;ons they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make way through that place and no other. The difficulty was to find out the means of compa&s;|&s;ing their De&s;ign: By plain force they did &s;ee it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We had given &s;everal Attempts to no other purpo&s;e but to di&s;cou|rage our men with the lo&s;s of their Companions. My Ma&s;ter was wounded with a Stone ca&s;t from a Sling. It Seems &s;ome of the&s;e
<HI>A|rabians</HI> are excellent Marks-men, and very dexterous at this old kind of Weapon.</P>
<P>There was no other way to come to fight with the&s;e People but one, which was al&s;o &s;o well fortified, that we lo&s;t our Labour and Men to attempt it. Our Ge|nerals <PB N="124" REF="67"> were afraid that this &s;mall Party that held out again&s;t us, would encrea&s;e by degrees, if they did once oblige us to a &s;tand, and that they would le&s;&s;en the re|putation of our Men in the Coun|trey, if we could not overcome them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they re&s;olved to &s;end a Flag of Truce, to try whether they could win them to a peace|able complyance without Arms: The
<HI>Arabians</HI> were glad to &s;ee this expre&s;&s;ion of our Weakne&s;s, which they might have improved to their advantage, had they ac|cepted the Offers that would have been made. They had been re|ceived again at their own terms, but as people that relie upon their own &s;trength, they took this as an open acknowledgment of the im|po&s;&s;ibility of our pa&s;&s;age with|out their leave, and thought them|&s;elves <PB N="125" REF="67"> &s;ufficiently &s;ecure again&s;t all our Attempts; therefore when our Me&s;&s;enger came with Offers of Peace, they were ready to beat him, and would not read the Let|ter &s;ent to their General, but con|temptuou&s;ly, before him, trod it under feet, telling him, that they knew our Demands without read|ing the Letter, and that they would &s;peedily return an An&s;wer in the Company of Thirty thou|&s;and men. This unexpected Re|turn to the Civility of our Lead|ers did not a little trouble them; for they imagined that &s;o proud and confident an An&s;wer did pro|ceed from &s;ome powerful a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance expected by the Enemy from their Brethren of the neighbour|ing Provinces: Their Conjecture was not in vain; for they had late|ly received the promi&s;es of a &s;pee|dy &s;upply from them of <HI>Fez, An|gad,</HI> <PB N="126" REF="68"> and <HI>Snatta,</HI> three Provinces, very large, where &s;everal of the Tribes of the <HI>Arabians</HI> do inhabit with the ancient Natives the <HI>Af|fricans,</HI> the one in Tents, the o|ther in &s;mall Villages. They were upon their March when they heard of the fir&s;t Defeat that the <HI>Turks</HI> had given to their Brethren at the difficult pa&s;&s;age. Fame had encreas'd the Number of the &s;lain, and repre&s;ented the &s;laughter to them ten times wor&s;e than really it was.</P>
<P>Some time before they had di&s;|patch'd a Me&s;&s;enger with News of their coming, which Me&s;&s;enger did according to his Orders, give an Account of the Numbers and Re&s;olution of them that &s;ent him to the Be&s;ieged. They relied up|on his words, not knowing of the contrary intentions that the change of Affairs had produced <PB N="127" REF="68"> in them; for a&s;&s;oon as they heard of the <HI>Turks</HI> Succe&s;&s;es, and their own Misfortunes, they returned back again, leaving their Friends and Brethren to our Mercy, and their own Protection.</P>
<P>This we knew not when the Me&s;&s;enger returned with &s;uch a re&s;olute An&s;wer: Therefore our Leaders thought it their Intere&s;t, to overcome the Enemy before any Supply might come to them.</P>
<P>We lay &s;everal days not know|ing what cour&s;e to take, until the <HI>Arabians</HI> them&s;elves furni&s;hed us an occa&s;ion to overcome them: They &s;ent out about Fifty Men to &s;teal Cattel, the&s;e we trapand &amp; took every one of them: A&s;&s;oon as news came to our General of their &s;urpri&s;al, he commands 50 choice Men to be pickt out of the Army, &s;ome of them &s;poke the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue well, &s;o that they
<PB N="128" REF="69"> could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed, the&s;e he cau&s;es to be habited as the <HI>A|rabians</HI> were, and to be armed with four Pi&s;tols a piece, which were hid in their Bo&s;oms; then he gives them about an hundred Head of Cattel to drive before them towards the <HI>Arabians:</HI> Ha|ving &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed them what to do, and informed them of the &s;ignal to be given, in ca&s;e they did &s;ucceed, he Commands them to March.</P>
<P>They accordingly a&s;cend up to the narrow Pa&s;&s;age, where the Enemy kept a &s;trong Guard, a&s;|&s;oon as they came within Call, they were ordered to pronounce <HI>Mahummed i &s;hur,</HI> the Word that was given the Thieves, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them from others; at that the Pa&s;&s;age was opened, and they drove in the Bea&s;ts without any oppo&s;ition; the Purcha&s;e did not <PB N="129" REF="69"> a little plea&s;e our Enemies, becau&s;e they had been put to &s;ome &s;traits for want of Victuals; they had &s;ome a coming from the other &s;ide, but it was not yet arrived; but when the Drivers of the&s;e Cattel proved to be none of their Friends, their joy was turned in|to fear.</P>
<P>Our Men were no &s;ooner enter|ed but they left the Conduct of the Bea&s;ts to &s;ome other Body, and fell to their work; they kill'd and &s;urpri&s;ed all the Guards there|abouts, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Advenue, giving notice thereof by a &s;udden fla&s;h of Gun|powder to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who pre|&s;ently a&s;cended the Hill and enter|ed the place; had they not arri|ved in time, all our Men had been cut to pieces, for they were mightily oppre&s;&s;ed with numbers, but we came opportunely to their
<PB N="130" REF="70"> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and forced the <HI>Ara|bians</HI> to &s;eek &s;afety in their heels.</P>
<P>Our Army pa&s;&s;ed into the Plain Countrey again, in pur&s;uance of their Enemies, who being tired with &s;o many Misfortunes and Lo&s;&s;es, and &s;eeing none come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they &s;ent &s;ome of their chief Men to treat with us about Peace; their Me&s;&s;age was acceptable to the whole Army.</P>
<P>That which mo&s;t per&s;waded them to &s;ubmit unto the
<HI>Turks,</HI> was, becau&s;e many of them had left their Wives and Children in the la&s;t Engagement behind them, to the <HI>Turks</HI> di&s;po&s;ition. Their Captivity did highly concern their near Relations, therefore they &s;ought all means to recover them again by a firm Treaty. They excu&s;ed unto us the impertinent An&s;wer, and the great Contempt of the <HI>Turks</HI> fir&s;t Offers, upon a <PB N="131" REF="70"> certain number of them that were then among&s;t the dead, a&s;&s;uring us that tho&s;e that were alive, had been led into this Rebellion a|gain&s;t their Wills, by meer nece&s;&s;i|ty, becau&s;e they had a depen|cy upon the Chief Men of them that were kill'd: For they have &s;everal &s;trong Factions among&s;t them, the chief Di&s;po&s;ers of all the re&s;t, according to his plea|&s;ure; they &s;wear by
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to maintain and follow him whither &s;oever he goes.</P>
<P>Our Generals received them into Favour again, upon condi|tion, that every Year they &s;hould pay a double Tribute, as a pu|ni&s;hment to their Rebellion. <HI>Elm|&s;war Tapnez</HI> their Chief Captain fled with all &s;peed towards <HI>Angad,</HI> that lies full South of the King|dom of
<HI>Argiers,</HI> &s;o that he could never come into the <HI>Turks</HI> power.
<PB N="132" REF="71"> We di&s;mi&s;t tho&s;e that yielded un|to us, and returned them their Wives and Children.</P>
<P>Our Generals having &s;o happily made an end of this War, that threatened the <HI>Turks</HI> Intere&s;t in tho&s;e Parts, began to &s;eparate again, and to proceed in their Journey over the Kingdom, to ga|ther the Tribute-money.</P>
<P>The People pay by the Head two Dollars, that is nine Shillings a Head, Men, Women and Chil|dren; tho&s;e that are very rich in Cattel are forced to part with more, when the Army goes the Rounds; and if any is extraor|dinary poor in a Family, his Neighbours and near Kinsfolks mu&s;t &s;upply his wants, and pay for him; &s;o that the total Sum of this Tribute is very great, I have heard &s;ome &s;peak of ten Millions of Dollars, be&s;ides the Expences
<PB N="133" REF="71"> of the Army. This Money is brought into <HI>Argiers,</HI> &s;ome part of it is &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to the Grand Segnior, another part defrays the Expences of the Mi|litia and Officers of Church and State, and another part is ca&s;t into the Publick Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Our Army proceeded right to <HI>Chin&s;an</HI> or
<HI>Tremi&s;en,</HI> a &s;trong and populous City, kept by the <HI>Turks</HI> with a numerous Guard that is re|lieved every year. Our General was de&s;igned Governour of this place, and was &s;ent thither with his Army to Command it.</P>
<P>We had a very plea&s;ant Jour|ney from this Mountain to that City, thorough a fruitful Coun|trey that did furni&s;h us both with Money and good Entertainment; &s;ome of them had been in the Re|bellion, but the
<HI>Turks</HI> would not deal with them more &s;everely than
<PB N="134" REF="72"> with the others, to oblige them to a greater Fidelity; for their is no greater tye to Obedience than Love, and the &s;en&s;e of for|mer Obligations: Our Army might have treated them as Ene|mies, &s;old their Goods, taken their Wives and di&s;po&s;ed of them as Bond-&s;laves; but they knew that this dealing would &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, but to exa&s;perate the Spirits of the re&s;t, who might then have rea&s;on to &s;eek an occa&s;i|on of a Revenge. It is never good to deal with Men as with Bea&s;ts; the latter are awed into obedience, but the fir&s;t mu&s;t be per&s;waded: The Magi&s;trates &s;word may &s;care me, but it &s;hall never win me.</P>
<P>This Practice of the <HI>Turks</HI> was very commendable: They thought it unworthy their Courage to tread on the Neck of a vanqui&s;h'd
<PB N="135" REF="72"> and yielding Enemy. Our Gene|ral, to oblige the Chief of the Fa|milies and Tribes, did invite &s;e|veral of them to eat with him; he be&s;towed Gifts upon &s;ome of the Arch Rebels, imitating the practi&s;e of tho&s;e Princes that be|&s;tow their Favours upon tho&s;e that are &s;u&s;pected, or that have been rebellious, to oblige them to be more faithful to their Intere&s;t for the future.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall Town, called by the <HI>Turks, Canatudi,</HI> and by the <HI>Moors, Canahaal,</HI> there was a great Fea&s;t kept for the Marriage of one <HI>Elm&s;war Bidow Ben hemmed,</HI> an <HI>Alcalde</HI> of one of their Tribes; our General coming to the place at that time, honoured the Solem|nity with his pre&s;ence, and cau&s;ed all his Captains and <HI>Chou&s;es</HI> to pay their re&s;pects to the Bride and Bridegroom.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="73">I cannot pa&s;s further until I take notice of what is ob&s;erved by this People in &s;uch occa&s;ions; the young man that hath a mind to marry, demands the Daughter from her Father, or next Kindred; if they grant her, he never trou|bles him&s;elf to win her con&s;ent; this is an excellent way to &s;pare a great deal of hypocri&s;ie, and to &s;ave the poor men much Court|&s;hip: The man makes a great Fea&s;t according to his Quality; &s;ome do treat their Friends &s;even days; the fir&s;t day he &s;ends to his future Spou&s;e by &s;ome Kin&s;woman, a Vail, to recommend unto her Mode&s;ty; the &s;econd day, a Suit of Appa|rel, &s;uch as they wear; the third day, a Mill to grind Corn, and In&s;truments to &s;pin, to remember &s;he may not be idle; the fourth, an <HI>Alcoran;</HI> the fifth, a pair of Slippers hand&s;omly made and <PB N="137" REF="73"> guilded; the &s;ixth day he &s;ends a Cock and a Dog, to teach her Diligence and Watchfulne&s;s; and the &s;eventh, a Ring of that Coun|trey Fa&s;hion, with a Di&s;h of Meat, and a Staff with this Motto about it, <HI>I will puni&s;h all Offenders.</HI> All this while the Bridegroom hath not &s;o much as &s;een his future Spou&s;e, but &s;ends to vi&s;it her often with &s;ome cour&s;e Complements, as as is u&s;ual among&s;t
<HI>Moors.</HI> On the eighth day, which is that of the greate&s;t Solemnity, the Bride|groom comes to the Fathers hou&s;e, accompanied by all his Friends and Kindred, and there in the pre|&s;ence of them all, the Father de|livers all his right, title and inte|re&s;t in his Daughter, to the man, by giving unto him her hand, and &s;aying &s;ome words proper to the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand. They go next to the place of Prayer, which in <PB N="138" REF="74"> Tents is near the middle; and there a <HI>Thaloub</HI> ble&s;&s;eth the marri|ed Couple, adding &s;everal Prayers to God, and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and to the Angel
<HI>Zadiel,</HI> that governs, as they &s;ay, the Planet <HI>Jupiter,</HI> to favour this Conjunction by &s;ome happy influence. Then they all march in order to the Fathers Hou&s;e, where a great Fea&s;t is pre|pared for them: The men by them&s;elves in one Room make merry; the Women in another, are jolly until the Evening: Then the Bride in all her State, with all her Hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe, Servants, Gifts and Money, is carried to the mans Hou&s;e; &s;he u&s;ually &s;its mounted on a Camel, glittering in Gold and Silk, and about her are all her Kindred and Friends. When &s;he comes to her Husbands Hou&s;e, &s;he then pulls off her Vail, becau&s;e Mode&s;ty is no longer in <PB N="139" REF="74"> &s;ea&s;on, nor proper to that place. Some do keep &s;everal Fea&s;t days afterwards, and &s;pend much of their E&s;tate, according to their a|bilities, or the love they bear to the Spou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was an Eye-witne&s;s of &s;everal Ceremonies ob&s;erved in this occa|&s;ion, which are related in other Travels.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed in this place &s;everal days to refre&s;h our &s;elves, and then we continued our Journey towards <HI>Chin&s;an,</HI> where we arrived on the third of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>It is a large and populous City, inhabited by a kind of People called <HI>Lhebdiah;</HI> round about are mo&s;t plea&s;ant Gardens and Or|chards. The Soil is good, the Climate wants nothing but People worthy to receive and enjoy the good things that it affords.</P>
<P>We found here great &s;tore of <PB N="140" REF="75"> Fruits, Apples, Pears, Melons of divers kinds, Grapes; for although the
<HI>Mahumetan</HI> drinks not Wine, he loves the Grape, and a kind of Drink that is made of Water and Rai&s;ins, called <HI>Africana;</HI> it is ve|ry plea&s;ant, and proper for this Climate.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;trange &s;ort of Tree made up of Leaves, one Leaf grows on the top of another; the Leaves are thick two or three inches in the middle; they are a|bove a foot large and long; an ex|cellent Fruit grows upon them, which the <HI>Arabs</HI> call <HI>A&s;holoch,</HI> our <HI>Engli&s;h, Prickle Pear;</HI> the Sub&s;tance is cold and refre&s;hing; it is ripe about
<HI>Mid&s;ummer,</HI> and of a yel|lowi&s;h colour. Every Garden is furni&s;hed with &s;uch a Tree: The Rind is full of little Prickles un|di&s;cernable; therefore it is not to be handled with naked hands. I <PB N="141" REF="75"> have &s;ince &s;een &s;ome in other parts.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a beautiful Tree of divers Colours, that the Great Men cau&s;e to grow in the mid&s;t of their Gardens; it &s;erves as an ex|cellent Ornament to a place: Its Body is of a deep green, the Boughs red, the Leaves yellow as Gold, with a mixture of white. Some told me that this Tree could not grow in any other Climate or Soil, and that &s;ome had laboured to tran&s;plant it on the Sea-&s;hore, but that Air had rendred all their Labours and Endeavours to little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Here is great abundance of Dates: That Tree never pro|duces unle&s;s there be a Conjuncti|on of the Male with the Female; they u&s;ually join their Boughs to|gether.</P>
<P>I had time in this place to take <PB N="142" REF="76"> a view of all the Rarities: It ap|pears to me to be one of the anci|ente&s;t Cities of the World; it &s;tands upon a plain ground, forti|fied with a &s;trong Wall, beautified with many &s;quare Marble Pillars, very white, the re&s;t of the Wall being built of a brown &s;tone; on the top the Bulwarks are adorned with Turrets of divers colours. The City yields a plea&s;ant &s;ight to the Beholder when the Sun &s;hines. The in&s;ide is no le&s;s beautiful. The Streets are &s;traight and broad. The Heart of the City contains many excellent Buildings. A &s;tately <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> &s;upported by a hundred Pillars of white Marble, with &s;e|veral Arches of very curious work; the Governours Palace, where there are a hundred large Rooms very neatly adorned with &s;everal mi&s;hapen Figures of divers Colours; for the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> ab|hor <PB N="143" REF="76"> Images and Statues; there|fore they have not the u&s;e of Pi|ctures, nor do not allow them to appear publickly in any place.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a Town-Hou&s;e, a place appointed for the meeting of the Chief Per&s;ons when any urgent Bu&s;ine&s;s calls them to con|&s;ult together: It &s;tands upon an Arch &s;upported by two Rows of Marble Pillars. It hath a Steeple to it built with half Brick and half Stone, very high and large. The top hath a Pro&s;pect into all the Countrey as far as our Eye|&s;ight will reach; and in one &s;ide is a large Room full of the anci|ent Records of the <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;ince the fir&s;t Conque&s;t of this Coun|trey, with many Large Vo|lumes.</P>
<P>The next Place to it is the Court that belongs to the
<HI>Cadir,</HI> the Chief Ju&s;tice, where he &s;its upon <PB N="144" REF="77"> a Seat covered with a Canopy of Cloth of Silver, the Seat is eleva|ted above the re&s;t in the manner of a Table &s;pred with <HI>Turky</HI> Car|pets, upon which he &s;its as a Tai|lor. A Fellow &s;tands at his El|bow with a naked Cymeter; a|bout him a little lower, &s;it &s;eve|ral of his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, who&s;e Coun|&s;el he takes in difficult Affairs. O|ver again&s;t &s;tands the Parties to be judged without delay; they u&s;u|ally receive the Puni&s;hments due to their Offence, at the &s;ame time that they are judged; for they admit of no Reprieve.</P>
<P>There are many other Hou&s;es very well built; they are flat on the Top; &s;ome are curiou&s;ly painted according to the <HI>Mo&s;aique</HI> Fa&s;hion. The Inhabitants do &s;leep upon them in the Summer, cover|ed with an
<HI>Alhage,</HI> to defend them from the venomous Flies, and from
<PB N="145" REF="77"> the <HI>Musketa's,</HI> pernicious Crea|tures that &s;uck their Blood.</P>
<P>In the middle of the City is a large Market-place, and round a|bout many Cloi&s;ters of the Reli|gious men among&s;t the <HI>Moors.</HI> One is more remarkable than the re&s;t, becau&s;e of the excellent Work|man&s;hip and ancient Fabrick, and becau&s;e of a great Library, a cu|rious thing among&s;t this rude Peo|ple: I know not with what man|ner of Books it is &s;tored; for Chri&s;tians have never the liberty to handle them; but as I did learn from the Keepers of the Door, they were Books that had been pick'd up in all the parts of <HI>Afri|ca</HI> by one of their Princes, and laid in that place, for the benefit of the Students, whereof there are very few, unle&s;s it be of Ma|gicians, and men that &s;tudy the Virtues of Simples. Other Arts
<PB N="146" REF="78"> and Sciences, as <HI>A&s;trology, Logick,</HI> the
<HI>Mathematicks,</HI> &amp;c. are almo&s;t extinct among&s;t them.</P>
<P>In the time of my abode among them, I have perceived that they pretend many times the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Devil to work miraculous Effects, when they do it by the Knowledges that they have of Nature.</P>
<P>They are very &s;uper&s;titious, and li&s;ten very much to the Reports and Whim&s;ies of their Sooth&s;ay|ers.</P>
<P>Some never undertake a Voy|age of any Concern, without con|&s;ulting the&s;e Oracles. Many in the&s;e parts make a great advan|tage of the Peoples Folly.</P>
<P>There is a Society among&s;t them that profe&s;s Fortune-telling. It is not &s;o much di&s;credited as in our Kingdom: They are per&s;ons for the mo&s;t part of Honour and <PB N="147" REF="78"> Reputation that are admitted to a familiar acquaintance with the in|fernal Spirits. They vouch&s;afe not to appear and di&s;cover them|&s;elves to every idle Ra&s;cal. I have &s;een wonderful Cures performed by their means, not &s;o much by the &s;ecret operation of the Spirit, as by the virtue of Herbs and Me|dicines applied to the Patient, which were directed and reveal|ed by the Evil Spirit; for the De|vil is a good Phy&s;itian, he may di&s;pute the Palm with
<HI>Hypocrates</HI> and <HI>Galen.</HI> I have &s;een a deaf man, who&s;e Organ was only ob&s;tructed, and not incapacitated, cured by the Application of an Herb like unto our Sorrel, called <HI>Hegn</HI> by the <HI>Moors.</HI> Agues and Fevers are driven away by the touch of &s;ome of the&s;e Magicians; other Di&s;ea&s;es require a longer time, and other Remedies.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="79">This City is full of this &s;ort of People that openly acknowledge them&s;elves to be &s;uch, and own a familiarity with &s;everal infernal Spirits: Their Names and Ap|pearance I could never know from them. I was very inqui&s;itive to under&s;tand &s;omething of their art; but their Grandeur could not &s;uf|fer them to entertain a Di&s;cour&s;e with a poor Slave. I have &s;een them make Figures &amp; Images of Clay and Wax, which they put up|on the top of their hou&s;es, e&s;pecial|ly in the two Sol&s;tices, in the Equi|noctials, and in the full Moon; the rea&s;on, as I did conceive, was to make them receive &s;ome quality which the Stars do &s;end down at &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons upon the corporal Bodies.</P>
<P>There are many &s;orts of Trades in this place; but as in mo&s;t Ci|ties of <HI>Barbary,</HI> they all live to|gether <PB N="149" REF="79"> in one Street that are of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At one end of the Town hard by the River <HI>Elouad</HI> that waters the Fields of <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> is erected a &s;tately Ca&s;tle, the Seat of the Lieutenant or Governour of the City: It overlooks the Town, and commands it with a hundred Peeces of Ordnance. Nothing is here remarkable but the Antiqui|ty of the Buildings and Fortifica|tions.</P>
<P>It was fir&s;t erected in the time of the <HI>Vandal</HI> Kings, to keep this Inland Countrey in &s;ubjection, and e&s;pecially this great and populous City. It hath been &s;ince enlarged by the <HI>Saracens.</HI> In the middle &s;tands a Pillar full of <HI>Arabick</HI> Letters, written in blew Figures upon black Marble, to &s;ignifie the memorable actions that have been performed in the time of <HI>Saracen</HI> <PB N="150" REF="80"> or
<HI>Arabick</HI> Kings. They have reigned in the&s;e parts many years before
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth attempt|ed to win <HI>Argiers.</HI> A &s;mall Hi&s;to|ry and Account of their Names and Actions I &s;hall annex in its place.</P>
<P>This City is the large&s;t in the whole Kingdom, which is limited on the North &s;ide by the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI> on the Ea&s;t by
<HI>Tunis,</HI> on the South by <HI>Angad,</HI> another large Kingdom in the Land, and by <HI>Snatta,</HI> Province that hath almo&s;t nothing but Mountains and Rocks; and on the We&s;t it bor|ders upon the Kingdom of <HI>Fez.</HI> It contains 250 Leagues in length, from the Sea in the Land as far as
<HI>Angad,</HI> and about 160 in breadth, from <HI>Bou&s;ema</HI> to the Cape called by our people <HI>Cap de Bugaremo.</HI> It contains &s;everal Cities well forti|fied, the chief are <HI>Argiers</HI> and <HI>Tre|mi&s;en,</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="80"> or <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> &s;o called by the Inhabitans; on the Sea-Coa&s;t are <HI>Cercelli, Bougia, Gigiari, Masta|gan, Bi&s;che, Gileto, Guien, Ar&s;eni, Oran,</HI> that belongs to the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> where a Marqui&s;s commands the Countrey about ten Miles round, with &s;even or eight hundred hor&s;e; <HI>Zereni, Ar&s;ebiba, Buazia, Corban,</HI> &s;ome of the&s;e are Cities, others but &s;mall Towns.</P>
<P>In the Land are many good Towns and Places of Note; the&s;e are the chief, <HI>Benibachul, Albori, Tegdeme, Stefe, Canatudi, Medua, Calamou, Lori, Albron, Segmes,</HI> a large Town that gives name to a Province &s;o called; <HI>Hagroah, Bi|broehl,</HI> and &s;everal others, who&s;e Names are hereafter mentioned: I have reckoned up here above a hundred Villages inhabited by the <HI>Africans,</HI> that are Servants to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and they are Sub|ject <PB N="152" REF="81"> to the <HI>Turk:</HI> Some of them retain the ancient Language. In the Province of <HI>Snatta</HI> they have a particular Speech, not under|&s;tood by any but by them&s;elves: Some told me that it is the old <HI>Pu|nick</HI> Language; for they that in|habit the&s;e Mountains and barren Places, were driven thither by the Wars and Cruelty of the new In|habitants, who had ground and room enough without troubling that poor &s;ort of People; there|fore they always left them to en|joy their own without di&s;turbing them; only they have obliged them to receive the Law of
<HI>Ma|homet:</HI> That was not difficult to impo&s;e upon a People that before had &s;carce any Religion; or if they had, it was accompanied with &s;o much Ignorance and Super&s;titi|on that they knew no rea&s;on to op|po&s;e that Religion that appeared <PB N="153" REF="81"> round about them, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;o univer&s;ally received.</P>
<P>In this City of <HI>Clim&s;an</HI> I remain|ed 3 years with my Ma&s;ter. At our fir&s;t Arrival our General took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Government, and of the Ca&s;tle, and the former Go|vernour took Charge of the Tri|bute-Money to be conveyed to <HI>Argiers.</HI> A week after our com|ing, he &s;et forwards with his Companies that had been weak|ned by the Di&s;ea&s;es of the la&s;t Year: His Commi&s;&s;ion ordered him to meet the We&s;tern Army, and both together to return home with their &s;ums of Money. Our De&s;tiny &s;taid us in this City, in which I met with various and &s;trange Adventures. I was
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> times obliged to undertake a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">|ney with my Ma&s;ter in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">: fir&s;t was towards
<HI>Angad,</HI> in which Province is a famous and ancient <PB N="154" REF="82"> City called <HI>Bedtua,</HI> not inferiour to <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> unle&s;s it be in the largene&s;s and excellency of the Buildings.</P>
<P>The Countrey round about is full of all &s;orts of Fruit, and is not &s;o hot as one might imagine. I found &s;everal &s;orts of Commodi|ties at a very cheap Rate, which we purcha&s;e with large Sums, and great labour and hazard. Hides, Hony, Bees-Wax are here in a great abundance.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t over a Sandy Valley a|bout half way to <HI>Bedtua,</HI> where we found a great deal of glittering Sand, much like to that of Gold. In the middle is a large Lake, unto which the wild Bea&s;ts and Serpents re&s;ort; above 50 or 60 did threat|en us when we offered to ap|proach.</P>
<P>Our Bu&s;ine&s;s in the&s;e parts was to treat with a great Commander <PB N="155" REF="82"> of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> the Prince of this Kingdom, about &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance to our Garri&s;on. My Ma&s;ter was di&s;patch'd as an Am|ba&s;&s;ador with a con&s;iderable Guard to defend him from the At|tempts of wild Bea&s;ts and Lawle&s;s Thieves, of which the Mountains are peopled.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to relate all the Particulars of our Journey, and the manner of our Reception.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through many Com|panies of Tents. They had cho|&s;en for their Situation the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Valleys, and fruitful Ground. The fir&s;t day we had a &s;harp Encounter with about a do|zen lu&s;ty Lions; they hunted af|ter their prey, and met with death at the end of our Muskets. They could not be kill'd without re|ceiving &s;ome damage: One of our men was wounded with the Paws <PB N="156" REF="83"> of one of the&s;e Furious Bea&s;ts, that leap'd upon him after that he had been &s;truck through the Belly. The danger of our Companion made us di&s;patch him &s;ooner out of the way. This danger was followed by another more fearful; but we e&s;caped out of it as hap|pily.</P>
<P>The next day we pa&s;&s;ed through a large and Sandy Plain of about ten Leagues long, and four broad, called by the <HI>Moors, Scidduahr;</HI> in it were rai&s;ed &s;everal little Hills moveable with the Wind, be|tween which of nece&s;&s;ity we were to pa&s;s. We were no &s;ooner en|tred, but a &s;trong Ea&s;terly Wind rai&s;es the light Sand, and threatens to bury us alive: It was a fearful thing to us to behold &s;o much Earth flying in our faces; the Air was thick with the du&s;ty Sand; in a moment a Hill was removed from <PB N="157" REF="83"> one place to another; be&s;ides that we had to encounter with the boi|&s;terous Wind, our Hor&s;es were half buried in a moment, we could not make a &s;top in this dreadful place for fear of being pa&s;t hopes of returning.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of our Journey was far more plea&s;ant; for it afforded us variety of Objects, not ungrate|ful unto us; be&s;ides, the way was le&s;s dangerous and le&s;s trouble|&s;om.</P>
<P>In eight days we had a &s;ight of the Walls of <HI>Bedtua:</HI> We were kindly entertained at the Princes Co&s;t. He was a Per&s;on of a mid|dle Stature, very &s;warthy, in his Face the Characters of Maje&s;ty did appear, and in his Garb and Attendance tho&s;e of his Dignity. At our arrival 500 Hor&s;e were &s;ent out to meet us at &s;ome di&s;tance from the City; they came in very <PB N="158" REF="84"> good Order, and led us to an A|partment that had been prepared for my Ma&s;ter Reception a&s;&s;oon as they heard of our Approach. We received here the Comple|ment of many per&s;ons of Quali|ty.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Prince was arri|ved from the Fields, we were &s;ent to wait upon him. The Ceremo|nies ob&s;erved on this Occa&s;ion I took exact notice of. The Princes Guards cloathed with a thin Stuff of a Scarlet Die, with red Bon|nets and white Feathers flying up|on it, yielded a mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;ight on both &s;ides of the way, that were lined with them. At a con|venient di&s;tance &s;tood the officers, who&s;e Garb and Meen did make us take notice of them for Per&s;ons more eminent than the re&s;t. They were as full of Civility as Honour, when my Ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ed by them;
<PB N="159" REF="84"> paying unto him as much Re&s;pect as an Amba&s;&s;ador from the Grand Seignior could expect.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through three large Streets in view of many Thou|&s;ands that did look upon us from the tops of the Hou&s;es and the Windows: Before us matched two grave Fellows very neatly dre&s;t; next went my Ma&s;ter, fol|lowed by two <HI>Turks</HI> bearing the Pre&s;ents de&s;igned for the Prince. We were attended by many of his Officers.</P>
<P>When we came to the Palace, the Guards that were at the Gate obliged us to leave our Sandals be|hind.</P>
<P>It is a very large Hou&s;e, built of Marble and Brick; the white and red Colours do yield a plea&s;ant &s;ight: We entred into three Courts very hand&s;omly adorned with curious work; at the fir&s;t my <PB N="160" REF="85"> Ma&s;ter was complemented by the Princes Secretary, at the &s;econd by his Brother, and led into the third, where He Him&s;elf was ly|ing in State. In the middle of it was erected a great Tent of green Silk; at the four Corners, and on the top were Flags of red Silk, ha|ving the Arms of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and of the Princes Family very neatly wrought: At the Door my Ma&s;|ter was met by the Prince him|&s;elf, who is bound to pay that re|&s;pect to any that comes in the Name of the Grand Seignior. Some Di&s;cour&s;e and kind Expre&s;&s;ions pa&s;&s;ed between them, which I could not approach to hear; they went next both together, and a&s;|cended three Steps at the further end of the Tent, and &s;ate upon a large Table, my Ma&s;ter at the left hand of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince; over their Heads a &s;tately Canopy <PB N="161" REF="85"> was hung, and round about Per|&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality &s;tood, to honour and encrea&s;e the Solemnity. My Ma&s;ter acquain|ted him with his Bu&s;ine&s;s and De|&s;ign, and received from him a very favourable An&s;wer, with a Promi&s;e to endevour his &s;pee|dy &s;atisfaftion.</P>
<P>I &s;aw here nothing of that rudene&s;s, which our People ima|gine to be in all the Parts of <HI>Afri|ca:</HI> The Place, and Attendance of the Prince, had as much of State and Glory, as is u&s;ual a|mong&s;t the little Princes of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> I found nothing barbarous but their Language, which I could not well under&s;tand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabs</HI> all about <HI>Africa</HI> are People very polite, and well bred; they have nothing of that ba&s;ene&s;s and uncivil carriage, which other more remote Nations <PB N="162" REF="86"> have: They are imperious a|mong&s;t the People that they have Conquered, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e they could never retain them in &s;ubjection to their Empire; but to Strangers that come among&s;t them, they are affable, ho&s;pita|ble, courteous, kind, and very liberal: If any harm is commit|ted to a Forreigner, it is not by them, but by the ra&s;cally &s;ort of People, the ancient Inhabi|tants, that look upon all Stran|gers for the <HI>Arabs</HI> &s;ake as Ene|mies, by Race of
<HI>Black-Mores,</HI> whereof there are here great Multitudes &s;ubject to the
<HI>Arabi|ans.</HI> My Ma&s;ter was about three hours in Conference with the Prince, and we as long waiting at the Door of the Tent; all the time a rough &s;ort of Mu&s;ick plaid, five men with &s;everal &s;orts of In|&s;truments made a Con&s;ort of <PB N="163" REF="86"> Tunes very har&s;h to our Engli&s;t Ears.</P>
<P>When the Di&s;cour&s;e was end|ed, my Ma&s;ter was led to the Door of the Tent by the Prince, and then by his Grandees he was conduced back to his Apart|ment with much Pomp and Joy.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, I mu&s;t give a further Account of the Prince that Commands &s;o far in the Land; his Name is <HI>Moy&s;es Zim Ku&s;h,</HI> a man of about forty years of Age, of a middle Stature, not &s;o &s;warthy as the ordinary <HI>Moors;</HI> his Body is &s;traight and &s;lender, his Face full of Maje&s;ty; never|thele&s;s he hath a very loving A&s;|pect; his people have a great re|&s;pect for him: He hath the Command of three great Tribes, that have &s;eated them&s;elves in the&s;e innermo&s;t Countries, a|mong&s;t the Sands and Mountains. <PB N="164" REF="87"> He had formerly &s;ome dependen|cy upon the King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco;</HI> but now by the death of the la&s;t Emperour, he became ab&s;olute, as I did then under&s;tand. And as he commands a great Compa&s;s of Ground, and hath no little power in regard of the Number of his Men and good In|comes, all his Neighbours have &s;ometimes need to &s;eek his Fa|vour.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter went not &s;o much to Court it as to treat with him about the publick Concerns. Se|veral Commodities do grow in his Countrey in a great abun|dance, which the Kingdome of <HI>Argeirs</HI> do want: My Ma&s;ter had a Commi&s;&s;ion to procure from him the Liberty of free Trading, and to &s;uffer them to be &s;ent out of his Dominions without &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Tribute <PB N="165" REF="87"> as he did formerly require, to the great prejudice of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that were obliged to buy them for want of others, at any Rate. He had Order al&s;o to complain of &s;e|veral Violences committed by the Princes Subjects upon the Borders; for &s;ome few Tents had lately been pitched in the <HI>Turks</HI> Confines by the&s;e <HI>Arabs,</HI> that would not acknowledge their Ju|ri&s;diction, and had robbed others that were under their Command, of about a hundred Head of Cat|tel, under pretence that the Own|ers did &s;uffer them to go out of their Limits, and graze where they &s;hould not. There were o|ther Robberies done of late by them of
<HI>Angad;</HI> for which my Ma&s;ter was to make complaint, and demand re&s;titution of the Goods. His bu&s;ine&s;s was al&s;o to de&s;ire this Prince not to &s;uffer his <PB N="166" REF="88"> People again to &s;end any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to them of the <HI>Turks</HI> Domi|nions, as they had done of late; and to &s;ettle a firm Peace and A|mity between the two Kingdoms of
<HI>Argeirs</HI> and <HI>Angad.</HI> The&s;e &s;e|veral Affairs did require much time and pains to bring to a Con|clu&s;ion; for great difficulties did pre&s;ent them&s;elves, that had al|mo&s;t ca&s;t my Ma&s;ter into a de|&s;pair of accompli&s;hing his De|&s;ign: The Princes Intere&s;t did apparently oppo&s;e it &s;elf, and per&s;wade him not to li&s;ten to the Amba&s;&s;adors Propo&s;als. His Ho|nour and Word were al&s;o enga|ged not to &s;uffer his Brethren to be cru&s;h'd in pieces without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and be&s;ides, &s;ome of the Rebels were fled out of fear, to his Court, where they had made a &s;trong Party to oblige the Prince to favour them and <PB N="167" REF="88"> their Concerns, to the prejudice of the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Difficulties that did ap|pear in this Negotiation were not to be overcome by an ordinary Judgment and Courage. Four per&s;ons of the
<HI>Sultans</HI> Council were appinted to receive and an|&s;wer the Amba&s;&s;adors Propo&s;als. At fir&s;t they would not li&s;ten to them, but returned a Smile and a Je&s;t to his Demands, as if they had been ridiculous: My Ma|&s;ter did often treat with them, but could not have any &s;atisfacti|on; They an&s;wered, for the Robberies that were done, they could not be prevented, that the per&s;ons demanded were not be found in tho&s;e parts; that if any &s;uch had done &s;uch violences, it was without the Princes know|ledge, again&s;t his Will; and that the per&s;ons were removed far in|to
<PB N="168" REF="89"> the Countrey, from whence they could not be fetch'd with ea&s;e: The truth was, that the Prince him&s;elf had received &s;ome pre&s;ents, and a con&s;iderable part of the Booty, which he was not willing to let go again. Unto all the other Demands they gave un|&s;atisfactory An&s;wers, which did oblige my Ma&s;ter to patience, and a re&s;olution: Fir&s;t he laboured within a few days to con&s;ider the divers Intere&s;ts that did rule, and the pre&s;ent E&s;tate of that Court, which did help him on in his bu|&s;ine&s;s; for he made u&s;e of tho&s;e per&s;ons that were able to &s;erve him, and did work upon them according to their Inclinations &amp; Intere&s;ts, to put an end to his Ne|gotiation. He had by this wi&s;e Conduct brought it to a very fair pa&s;s; after much labour and per&s;wation he had obliged the
<PB N="169" REF="89"> Prince to a re&s;titution of part of the Plunder, and to promi&s;e to maintain Peace, and not to &s;uffer any Injuries to be done by his People to the Subjects of the <HI>Turk.</HI> But this did not &s;atisfie my Ma&s;ter; he was re&s;olved to ob|lige him to con&s;ent to the re&s;t of his Demands, and to force him to abate &s;omething of the great Cu|&s;toms that were rai&s;ed upon the Commodities of the Countrey, that were tran&s;ported out of the Limits; but this could never have been obtained, had it not been for an Accident that hap|pened afterwards; My Ma&s;ter was &s;o di&s;couraged when he came from a Meeting where the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were pre&s;ent, that he gave me order to prepare all things for his &s;peedy departure. I &s;aw that his Melancholy look did di&s;cover his Di&s;content, and <PB N="170" REF="90"> his Commands the cau&s;e of his Di&s;plea&s;ure: I made bold with him to comfort him in this occa|&s;ion, and did offer him at all ad|ventures a remedy to his di&s;&s;atis|faction, if he would be plea&s;ed to tell unto me how his bu&s;ine&s;s did &s;tand; he had often tried my ex|perience in affairs, and had no lit|tle confidence upon my Fidelity &amp; Wit. This was not the fir&s;t time that I had been u&s;eful unto him to help him out of difficult Af|fairs; therefore he propo&s;ed to me the whole &s;tate of his bu&s;ine&s;s. Sir, &s;aid I to my Ma&s;ter, Trou|ble not your &s;elf, I will cau&s;e the Prince to give you full &s;atisfacti|on. You cannot &s;o ea&s;ily do what you have promi&s;ed, replied my Ma&s;ter. I an&s;wered to him, that I was much mi&s;taken if I had not found out a way to bring him to con&s;ent to things more <PB N="171" REF="90"> contrary to his Intere&s;t than what he had propo&s;ed. He was de&s;i|rous to know; I told him the Plot, and wi&s;h'd him to put it &s;peedily in execution; for diffi|cult Cau&s;es require a &s;tout re&s;olu|tion, and a great diligence. My Ma&s;ter found my Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o rea&s;onable, and the De&s;ign &s;o probable, that he began to em|brace me, and promi&s;ed my free|dom his return to <HI>Argiers,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful in this bu&s;ine&s;s; he proceeded in it as I per&s;waded him, in this man|ner: The Prince of <HI>Angad,</HI> who is honoured with the Title of <HI>Sul|tan,</HI> had a Nephew Heir to his E&s;tate and Fortune, of a great Courage, and of as great Am|bition; the People had for him a particular re&s;pect, becau&s;e his Father had &s;acrificed his Life for the publick Good, and becau&s;e <PB N="172" REF="91"> he had an in&s;inuating pre&s;ence, that did command both Love and Reverence from all that did be|hold him; he was be&s;ides grown very popular, &s;etting his Genius, his Inclinations and Actions to the temper of every one; which Carriage did wonderfully win unto him the e&s;teem of all the <HI>Arabs;</HI> his Name was <HI>Zidi Hamed Hochbu&s;h.</HI> Since my Ma&s;ters ar|rival in the&s;e parts, he did often vi&s;it him, and delighted much in his Company: I know not whe|ther he had a de&s;ign to ingratiate him&s;elf by that means with the Garri&s;on of
<HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> or oblige the <HI>Turks</HI> to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in ca&s;e any thing &s;hould be undertaken again&s;t him. My Ma&s;ter, accord|ing to my Advice, be&s;tows upon him at the fir&s;t Interview, in &s;e|cret, all the Flatteries &amp; Prai&s;es that he was able to expre&s;s, telling
<PB N="173" REF="91"> him that &s;o noble a Soul was ne|ver born to be a Subject; that the whole Countrey did love him entirely, as one that was worthy of their homages and re|&s;pect; that he would do well to look to him&s;elf, le&s;t any Diffe|rence or Jealou&s;ie, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Occa&s;ions, &s;hould ari&s;e be|tween him and his Uncle, which might co&s;t him his Head; that it would become the greatne&s;s of his Courage and Birth not to &s;toop to &s;uch mean Offices as he was employed about; and that that was done purpo&s;ely to aba&s;e him in the e&s;teem of the People. This Di&s;cour&s;e my Ma&s;ter &s;weet|ned with &s;trong prote&s;tations of his Love and readine&s;s to do him Service, promi&s;ing to publi&s;h his worth among the <HI>Turks</HI> his Coun|treymen.</P>
<P>The young man perceived not <PB N="174" REF="92"> my Ma&s;ters De&s;ign, but began to conceive very haughty thoughts of him&s;elf and Abilities.</P>
<P>Within a few days after he came to pay my Ma&s;ter a Vi&s;it. They both entred into an inner Room, admitting none to enter in to them but my &s;elf, and there they fell upon the &s;ame di|&s;cour&s;e: My Ma&s;ter omitted no|thing, to make him believe that Nature and Providence had de|&s;igned him for the Throne, a&s;|&s;oon as he was Born. As we had before determined to give him a <HI>Regalio,</HI> my Ma&s;ter &s;ent for three Leathern Bottles of Wine, that I had &s;ecretly conveyed a|mong&s;t his Baggage, and brought to
<HI>Bedtua;</HI> for the <HI>Turks</HI> con&s;cience may drink Wine privately with|out a Di&s;pen&s;ation: The Young-Man had never ta&s;ted &s;uch a Li|quor in his Daies before, for <PB N="175" REF="92"> although they have in that Coun|try abundance of Grapes, they have lo&s;t the u&s;e of Wine: How plea&s;ing therefore this reception was to him, may be ea&s;ily ima|gined.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter continued in his Hypocri&s;ie, and prote&s;ted, that out of a &s;incere re&s;pect for him, he did offer this rarity to him: The Young-Man was &s;oon hot with a little of this Liquor; it made him reveal unto my Ma&s;ter &s;everal Intrigues, that were not unu&s;eful unto him afterwards; but the chiefe&s;t Operation of this Wine, was, when he met with the Prince his Uncle, who began to chide him for &s;ome un|decent action that he had done, he then fell into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, that all imagined him to be Mad; the Prince ca&s;t a Lance at him, and had he not declined the <PB N="176" REF="93"> Blow, he had there ended his daies, and fru&s;trated our de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>There grew &s;uch hatred im|mediately between them, that they could not &s;uffer the &s;ight of one another: The Prince did not dare to ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on, becau&s;e of the People; and the Nephew would never tru&s;t him for the future.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;ention was increa&s;ed daily by fal&s;e Friends, who do advantage and plea&s;e them&s;elves with the ruin of others: At la&s;t, the Young Nephew grew very jealous of his Uncles De&s;igns, and began to meditate an E&s;cape out of his Dominions: My Ma|&s;ter per&s;waded him not to delay, but &s;peedily to fly for his Life; for if it were once &s;u&s;pected, his Uncle would not be retained by any con&s;ideration from depri|ving
<PB N="177" REF="93"> him of his Liberty, it may be with his life; for that end he gave him a Hor&s;e, an excellent Cour&s;er that he had brought with him: He made ha&s;te to|wards the Borders with a few fol|lowers, where he rai&s;ed the Coun|try, that came in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that within a few days he ap|peared at the head of 10000 men. News came daily of &s;ome Parties that did join with them, and at la&s;t we heard how the <HI>Turks</HI> of
<HI>Argeirs</HI> were re&s;olv'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t him were not their Demands granted.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter began to take his leave a&s;&s;oon as this was reported in the Town: The Prince to prevent it, offered him his De|mands, and loaded him with Ci|vilities; for he fore&s;aw the dread|ful con&s;equence that would en|&s;ue if he offered to offend the <HI>Turks,</HI> and if they did counte|nance <PB N="178" REF="94"> his Nephew in his Rebelli|on, it might prove the ruine of Him&s;elf and Kingdom; there|fore to engage them to his Inte|re&s;t, which was the mo&s;t ju&s;t, he courted my Ma&s;ter, their Amba&s;|&s;ador, with all expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s; our Lodgings were al|ways full of Courtiers, and eve|ry day we did feel and &s;ee &s;ome Tokens of the Princes Kindne&s;s or Fear.</P>
<P>This part of the Countrey be|gan to be in no little apprehen&s;i|on at fir&s;t; but when my Ma&s;ter had received full &s;atisfaction, he &s;etled their minds with the a&s;&s;u|rance that the
<HI>Turks</HI> were too hone&s;t to approve of the Ne|phews Rebellion again&s;t an Un|kle: Yet &s;uch was my Ma&s;ters kindne&s;s for the young man, that he mediated for him, and obliged the Prince to invite him again to
<PB N="179" REF="94"> his Duty, and pardon his Of|fences; which he accepted of willingly, when he heard how we had promi&s;ed to lend our &s;uc|cours to his Unkle, in ca&s;e he &s;hould remain ob&s;tinate in the pur&s;uance of his wicked De|&s;ign. He quickly return'd to Court, and was there received with a jealous Countenance, that had always an Eye upon him and his Actions: The fond Love the People had conceived for him &s;a|ved his Life; for none did dare to attempt to injure him that was &s;o dear to every one.</P>
<P>The young mans confidence upon the Peoples Affection made him more impertinent than o|therwi&s;e he would have been: It made him appear more bold to oppo&s;e his Unkle, and more negligent in his Duty towards him.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="95">When we had our Di&s;patches, we left him to his own Fortune, and return'd again to <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> to the great &s;atisfaction of all the City, who did hope to reap no &s;mall advantage from this Nego|tiation. My Ma&s;ter had the ho|nour of it, although it was ef|fected by my Contrivance. He ever after employed me in his difficult Affairs, and admitted me into his private Council; An Ho|nour that a Slave could never ex|pect from the <HI>Turks</HI> Severi|ty.</P>
<P>We made &s;ome &s;tay in this Ci|ty of <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> in which time I took notice of many Particulars of the &s;everal manners of Execu|tion, which are the&s;e; <HI>Empa&s;ing,</HI> They thru&s;t a &s;harp Stake into the Body of the Criminal, which enters in between their Legs, and appears again at their Mouth&punc; <PB N="181" REF="95"> This is their u&s;ual way of treating notable Robbers, and Fellows that have acted again&s;t the Go|vernment: It is cruel and in|humane; for it puts the Patient to a long Pain when the Stake hath e&s;cap'd the Heart, and &s;ome of the more &s;en&s;ible Parts: Some I have &s;een alive near &s;ix hours in this manner.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that commit Adultery, or that attempt any thing again&s;t the Lives of them whom they &s;hould defend, are ca&s;t headlong down a Precipice, at the bottom whereof &s;harp Stakes are erected to welcome them, and di&s;patch them into another World. I have heard &s;ad Groans and Out|cries from &s;uch that have been thus executed.</P>
<P>There is another manner of Execution, not u&s;ual in our Cli|mates; when any have commit|ted <PB N="182" REF="96"> Sacriledge, or done any Acti|on to the di&s;honour of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or the Religion profe&s;&s;ed in this place, they poure &s;calding Lead into his Mouth, which &s;inks in with a horrible Smoke, and burns the Throat to the Entrails: I ne|ver heard any give the lea&s;t &s;hrick; for the burning Metal con&s;umes all before it, and cau&s;es the Wind-pipe to &s;hrink.</P>
<P>Others are expo&s;ed to the cru|elty of the Children, who with &s;harp Sticks and Canes do prick them to death, that they might accu&s;tom the&s;e young Spirits to Blood and Wounds, that when they grow to age they might le&s;s abhor it. I have &s;een them take a great delight to thru&s;t their &s;harp Reeds into the Sides and Back of the poor Criminal, who is not able to defend him&s;elf, but with his Tongue; for his Hands
<PB N="183" REF="96"> and Legs are tyed in &s;uch a man|ner as he may only walk. It is a very pitiful Spectacle to &s;ee a poor Creature bleed out his Soul through &s;o many Wounds. The &s;portful Outcries and Voices of the Children do hinder the dying men from being heard. Some of them continue alive many hours, &s;prinkling their blood wherever they crawl.</P>
<P>There is here another as &s;trange an Execution as the for|mer; In the great Market place of the City a brazen Lion &s;tands, hollow within, with a grim and threatning Countenance, at his Side a Door opens, which is made to receive tho&s;e that are to be executed in that manner. They are per&s;ons that are guilty of &s;ome horrid Crimes, and that have offended the Publick in a grievous manner. To recom|pen&s;e <PB N="184" REF="97"> them therefore by their Deaths, they execute them thus, that they that have been u&s;ele&s;s in their Lives, may give &s;ome &s;port at lea&s;t at their going out of the world to the People; they are &s;hut into this new Inven|tion, and a Fire of Wood is kindled under it, which by de|grees, as it heats the Bra&s;s, it puts them to a greater torture: The pain forces them to complain and cry out.</P>
<P>Now at the Mouth, Ears, and under the Tail of the Lion are holes artificially made, out of which the Complaints and Cries of the Patient do bur&s;t forth through different Windings and Turnings, in &s;uch a manner that &s;everal Voices, or rather Tunes, are framed one after another; for the Cry is longer a coming out of the Tail than the Ears, and <PB N="185" REF="97"> &s;o of the Mouth: Be&s;ides, the vari|ety of Cries yields a plea&s;ant and a various &s;ound to the Ears of the Spectators. This cruel &s;port continues many times a whole day, to divert the people; for at the Judges plea&s;ure they kin|dle a le&s;&s;er or a greater Fire, which cau&s;es the Patient to die accordingly. I could never learn the Author of this inhumane En|gine which hath been died with &s;o much blood; for during my three years abode in that place, I &s;aw above twenty ca&s;t into that Oven. A Woman, a Child and a Man were put in together; for it is very large: Their Crime was that they had attempted to kill our Governour, by the &s;ol|licitation of a <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> Prince that hated him. The Woman was to trapan and en&s;nare him with her Beauty, and convey &s;ecretly &s;ome <PB N="186" REF="98"> poi&s;on by that means into his Drink, when &s;he &s;hould be ad|mitted into his Familiarity, and in ca&s;e that Plot did not &s;ucceed, then the man was to &s;tab or &s;hoot him when he could meet him at an advantage. Our old General was not &s;o aged but he had &s;ome Reliques of his youthful Inclina|tions; when therefore he &s;aw her Beautiful Eyes, large and full of Spirits, he laboured to get into her more intimate Acquaintance, thinking to meet there with a perfect happine&s;s; he employed &s;uch means as he quickly compa&s;|&s;ed his De&s;ign, but not to his &s;a|tisfaction &s;o much as was expect|ed; for as they were together, &s;he di&s;covered a Box which &s;he was &s;o de&s;irous to hide from him, that he became &s;u&s;pitious that it might be &s;omething that he un|der&s;tood not: A&s;&s;oon as he &s;aw <PB N="187" REF="98"> it, he judged it to be poi&s;on; but to be more a&s;&s;ured, he tried it upon a Dog, which &s;uffered the &s;trength of it in&s;tead of his Ma|&s;ter, and died within an hour af|ter the taking of it. The Wo|man confe&s;&s;ed her de&s;ign, and that her Husband was one that intended to perform what &s;he had failed to do, in another man|ner. They were both taken, with an innocent Boy about twelve years of Age, and all three con|demned together; the Child on|ly becau&s;e he had &s;uch de&s;perate and wicked Parents, to imprint a greater terror into the minds of &s;uch Offenders for the fu|ture: There was no regard had to Innocency it &s;elf: The poor Child was forced to accompany his Parents in Death, as well as in the pur&s;uance of their unlaw|ful De&s;ign. Their different Voices
<PB N="188" REF="99"> and cries did yield a mo&s;t plea&s;ant although a cruel Harmony, which was not ungrateful to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who never pity the
<HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P>They u&s;e in this City &s;trang|ling as well as the
<HI>Turks</HI> in other places, and Drowning with a Stone tied to the neck, executing by Bea&s;ts, by the Sword, and &s;uch other &s;orts of Death, common in other places.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is another man|ner of executing Offenders pro|per to this place, which I never heard to be practi&s;ed in any o|ther. It is as cruel as it is &s;trange to us. Out of the Town is planted a high Po&s;t in form of a Cro&s;s, upon which the Offender is laid; they fir&s;t &s;trip him na|ked and cut out his Tongue, then they &s;tretch him on the Po&s;t that lies acro&s;s, and tye him to it both by his hands and feet: thus they
<PB N="189" REF="99"> expo&s;e him to the fury of the ravenous Birds, that &s;oon &s;mell him out. The Eagles and Vul|tures do di&s;patch him in le&s;s than a day: The poor Creature lies at their mercy; he &s;ees them fix their &s;harp Bills in his fle&s;h, and pluck out his Heart, not being able to re&s;i&s;t them; he &s;ees him|&s;elf become a Prey to the Birds of the Air; which cannot but trouble him, to behold &s;uch ba&s;e Creatures feed them&s;elves with his Fle&s;h, and in&s;ult over him, without the lea&s;t re&s;pect to his humanity. It is ob&s;erved, that the Eagles &s;eek fir&s;t for the Heart; they tear up the Bre&s;t till they have found it, without any regard to the re&s;t of the Body, until that be devoured. Sometimes Twenty of the&s;e great Birds are &s;een at one time upon a poor Man, for this part
<PB N="190" REF="100"> of the world is full of them. It is a &s;ight that may move any bo|dies compa&s;&s;ion, but that of the <HI>Turks,</HI> to &s;ee one of the &s;ame na|ture thus torn and ript up by the&s;e cruel Birds: I was never &s;o much concern'd at any thing in my life as I was at it: Had I not feared the Cen&s;ure of the Law, I had ventured to protect the mi|&s;erable Body of one poor man from the tho&s;e ravenous Birds; but it is no le&s;s than death to hin|der the Execution of the Judges Sentence.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;er Offences are puni&s;h|ed in a milder manner, but in &s;uch, as renders the per&s;ons lame, and di&s;ables them from all bu|&s;ine&s;s for a long time after; the <HI>Ba&s;tinado</HI> either upon the Back, the Belly, or the Soles of the Feet, is very common upon any light occa&s;ion. The cutting off <PB N="191" REF="100"> of the Ears, No&s;e, and other na|tural Ornaments of the Body is u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they brand others in the Forehead with a Character &s;ignifying the Crime that they have committed.</P>
<P>They impri&s;on &s;ome, and de|tain them long at a &s;hort allow|ance of Bread and Water to tame their &s;pirits. In this City, be|&s;ides the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Governour that commands the Ca&s;tle, there is in the Town a Magi&s;trate called an <HI>Alcalde,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> born, &s;ubject to the <HI>Turks</HI> Power, who among&s;t the Citizens does Ju&s;tice to eve|ry one: He is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by nine cho|&s;en out of the nine parts of the Town; all together do &s;it upon the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s: The plura|lity of Voices alwaies carries it.

<PB N="191" REF="101"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="192" REF="102"> the Governour doth of the Mi|litia.</P>
<P>The Countrey round about is very fruitful of all &s;orts of Corn; for it is Champaign Ground, wa|tered with many fre&s;h water Sources and plea&s;ant Rivulets: Here is abundance of Wheat, Barley, Rice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Oats, they grow Wild in the places that are not Ploughed; every Spring cau|&s;eth the Roots to &s;hoot out, and produce again this Grain; for the heat of the Summer renders all things unfruitful, as the humi|dity of the Winter doth re&s;tore unto them their native fertility.</P>
<P>The Commodities of this Place are many; the ordinary, are Oyl, Ginger, Silk, Rai&s;ins, a Stuff made of the Barks of Trees, which the Inhabitants cau&s;e to be Dyed in all &s;orts of Colours; Balm, which is here of &s;uch an <PB N="193" REF="102"> excellent nature, that it is a &s;o|veraign Remedy to all Wounds, within the &s;pace of four and twenty hours it clo&s;eth and heals a Cut in the Fle&s;h. Here is al&s;o many &s;orts of Drugs, which our Merchants fetch from the <HI>Indies,</HI> with va&s;t Co&s;t and Labour. In &s;ome places here is a golden Sand, which, if any indu&s;trious People did &s;ee and enjoy it, I think they might reduce it to true Gold, by refining all the &s;andy and dro&s;&s;y part; but the Inha|bitants make little u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>In the De&s;ert Places of this Kingdom, are great quantity of Creatures, who&s;e skin makes the excellent Buff; they are about the bigne&s;s of an Ox, without a|ny Joints at their Feet, therefore they can hardly ri&s;e when they fall; they run very &s;wiftly: The Inhabitants take them in this man|ner; <PB N="194" REF="103"> They ob&s;erve the place where the&s;e Bea&s;ts do rub them|&s;elves; if it be a Tree, they cut the Stump, and prop it up in &s;uch a manner that it &s;tands up, ready to fall at the lea&s;t violence; when the&s;e Bea&s;ts come to their u&s;ual place, they rub according to their cu&s;tome, leaning them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the broken Tree, which falls, and they after it. Here are other &s;orts of bea&s;ts ordina|ry in our Climates: Tigers are here of an extraordinary bigne&s;s, with Leopards, wild A&s;&s;es, wild Hor&s;es with a tumor in their fore|head that is hard; which may have occa&s;ioned the Fable of the Unicorn; for in &s;ome it &s;hoots out in &s;uch a manner that it ap|pears like unto a Horn of a white Colour, of a Cubit long. The Hor&s;es are all either white or black: The <HI>Moors</HI> name them
<HI>Bou|chicoughs.</HI> <PB N="195" REF="103"> I never &s;aw any tam'd. They are &s;o &s;wift in running that no Hor&s;e can follow them; &s;ome|times they are &s;urprized when they come near the inhabited Countrey, and are kill'd with Guns, but it is a difficult bu&s;ine&s;s to catch them alive; their young ones are very wild and &s;wift, and are of a ruddy colour until they come to be a year old.</P>
<P>There is here a great number of O&s;triches; it is a notable bird, that runs and flies very &s;peedily; no Creature is able to keep pace with it. Many extraordinary things are reported of it. The Countrey people &s;ay that they do &s;ometimes find their Ne&s;ts in the Sands: They make them in this manner; they &s;crape a round Pit as large as their body, where they place their Eggs in order. They lay above a hundred before <PB N="196" REF="104"> they cau&s;e them to bring forth, not in a heap, but in &s;everal ranks; the Sun-beams warm them and cau&s;e them to bur&s;t forth in|to birds; the Mother-O&s;trich o|verlooks them, and when the fir&s;t laid Eggs are become birds, &s;he takes the farthermo&s;t Eggs to feed them until they come of age and &s;trength to walk alone. It is a Creature that is carele&s;s of her Fruit until they are birds, and then &s;he nouri&s;hes them with care, giving equally to all, &s;hew|ing thereby her Ju&s;tice. She is a bird very temperate, content with a &s;mall quantity of food, and able to dige&s;t the harde&s;t &s;ub|&s;tance, as Iron, Steel, and Stones.</P>
<P>Near the City is a Fountain of a &s;trange nature; it yields a plentiful Stream, when the Moon is in its Full, then the Water is
<PB N="197" REF="104"> boiling hot; but it cools by de|grees as the Moon decrea&s;es, and becomes extream cold when it is the la&s;t day; the Stream al&s;o be|coming le&s;&s;er or greater accor|dingly. When any are troubled with the Gout or any other Di&s;|ea&s;e in the Limbs, they repair thither from all parts to be wa&s;ht in that Water, that is bracki&s;h. I have known many that have been cured in the Bath that is joining to it, by wa&s;hing them|&s;elves &s;everal days in the full Moon.</P>
<P>One thing more renders this Place famous all over the Coun|trey, and cau&s;eth people from all parts to re&s;ort to it: Here is the Tomb of a great <HI>Hage,</HI> not much inferiour to <HI>Mahomet</HI> in the e&s;teem of this People, as much re&s;pected by all that fancy to have received any benefit from <PB N="198" REF="105"> their Pilgrimages hither. Men or Women that are troubled with I&s;&s;ues of blood, Agues, Tu|mors, Drop&s;ies, and many other Di&s;ea&s;es, do take a great deal of pains to come and pay their Re|&s;pects to the Coffin of this old Saint, renowned in his Life time for Phy&s;ick, and after his Death, the <HI>Moors</HI> have fancied that his bones and Reliques had &s;ome ex|traordinary virtue contained in them, which they &s;eek to be par|takers of by their Devotions in this place. So ea&s;ie a thing it is to per&s;wade the Ignorant Multi|tude to Super&s;tition: When men are e&s;teemed for &s;ome extra|ordinary qualities, the People fancy that the&s;e qualities do yet accompany them in their graves, that they are in&s;eparable from their bodies. The Heathen I|dols were increa&s;ed by this means <PB N="199" REF="105"> to that va&s;t Army of Gods, and <HI>Rome</HI> hath fill'd her Oratories with an innumerable company of petty Saints by this Expedient; for it is ordinary in the Popi&s;h Dominions to make them pa&s;s for Saints that have excelled in any particular Art or Knowledge, when that Generation is dead that hath been acquainted with the Vices and Weakne&s;&s;es of the De|cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is at a League di&s;tant from the City, towards the Ea&s;t, the Ruines of an old Tower, and about it a large Cave, where, as the People of the Town report, are frequent Appearances of Devils and evil Spirits that di&s;turb the Pa&s;&s;en|gers at certain Sea&s;ons of the Year; &s;ome told me that there|abouts was kept the Witches Sab|baoth, a general Meeting of <PB N="200" REF="106"> tho&s;e de&s;perate Souls that own the Devils Power. It is believ|ed by the people that this place is dangerous in the night, al|though I never &s;aw any thing wor&s;e than my &s;elf when I have pa&s;t that way, going about my Ma&s;ters bu&s;ine&s;s in all times of the day and night. But when &s;uch kind of Reports are im|printed into the Fancy of the People, the lea&s;t te&s;timony of a timorous per&s;on that hears the &s;haking of a Leaf is able to con|firm them in that belief, and no|thing can remove it out of their minds. I do not doubt but &s;ome Appearances have been of Evil Spirits; none but a Phanta&s;tick Sadducee is able to deny this Truth that hath all Ages to con|firm it; but we mu&s;t not be of &s;o light a belief as to credit all the idle Reports of Appearances <PB N="201" REF="106"> of Devils which fly among&s;t the vulgar &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>In this City of <HI>Tremi&s;en</HI> or <HI>Clim|&s;an</HI> we made our abode longer than my Ma&s;ter at fir&s;t de&s;igned; but his good Services to them of <HI>Argiers</HI> de&s;erved no le&s;s than a grateful acknowledgement, by advancing him to a higher, em|ployment, &s;uch as might reward him.</P>
<P>At the return of the year, when the <HI>Turks</HI> Army came to re|lieve us, my Ma&s;ter had order to be Lieutenant Governour of the City, and to remain &s;till as long as he &s;hould judge it convenient for his Intere&s;t. This place proved very beneficial to him, becau&s;e he had the Com|mand of the Parties that did march out in the Fields to plun|der upon the Enemy; and when the Governour was plea&s;ed to go <PB N="202" REF="107"> out him&s;elf towards the Borders, my Ma&s;ter had the Governours &s;mall Fees, that did amount to a con&s;iderable &s;um in &s;uch a large City. During this time that we dwelt in this place &s;everal nota|ble Affairs happened, which may claim a part in this Relation: The uncon&s;tant <HI>Arabians</HI> did often ri&s;e and trouble our peace, by their frequent Incur&s;ions; the King of
<HI>Fez,</HI> made an Inroad as far as our City with a con|&s;iderable Body of Hor&s;e, thinking to &s;urprize it unawares. Several other Princes were trouble&s;ome to us, obliging our people to un|u&s;ual Tributes and Cu&s;tomes when they pa&s;&s;ed through their Countrey; for this City enter|tains a great Trade with the In|land people, and with the <HI>Blacks.</HI> It was therefore the <HI>Turks</HI> inte|re&s;t to entertain it, and remove
<PB N="203" REF="107"> all Ob&s;tructions wich might hin|der a free Intercour&s;e: For that intent we had &s;everal trouble&s;om Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es both Warlike and Po|litick, which employed my Ma|&s;ter all the time of his being there. In the mean whiles I was not idle; I had &s;everal Affairs that concerned my private Inte|re&s;t, and that I was to manage with Care and Indu&s;try. The <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Argeirs</HI> gave a judg|ment of my Ability and Per&s;on, which was not contradicted by the Women with whom I was af|terwards acquainted.</P>
<P>I had as difficult Encounters, and as &s;trange Adventures that happened to me with them, as my Ma&s;ter had in treating with the
<HI>Arabs.</HI> I was no &s;ooner &s;et|led in <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> but one of that Sex &s;ought a fair occa&s;ion to di&s;|cover her Affection to me.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="108">I was very wary how I entertain|ed any &s;uch Propo&s;ition; for I was affraid of my Ma&s;ters Cun|ning, or any other Plot which might be &s;et on foot to drive me to a nece&s;&s;ity of turning
<HI>Mahu|metan;</HI> for I was often impor|tun'd by my Ma&s;ter, and invited with the promi&s;e of my Liberty, in ca&s;e I would renounce Chri&s;ti|anity; but I could never con&s;ent to &s;o much weakne&s;s, nor to act again&s;t &s;o much Light God had di&s;covered to me in his Truth. I was therefore affraid that all addre&s;&s;es that were made to me of that nature were but De&s;ignes to en&s;nare me, and oblige me to Apo&s;tacie. I did not accept of &s;o fair opportunities as were of|fered to me, which created me a great deal of trouble; for tho&s;e per&s;ons became my deadly Ene|mies, they &s;ought all occa&s;ions
<PB N="205" REF="108"> to do me mi&s;chief: Angered Love turns into deadly hatred. The fir&s;t who&s;e Care&s;&s;es I was to &s;uffer was the Wife of a wealthy Citizen of <HI>Clim&s;an;</HI> her Husband was old and decrepit, and &s;he very young, and therefore more pardonable if &s;he &s;ought &s;atisfa|ction abroad, when &s;he could not find it at home. I was often &s;ent to her Hou&s;e for things that my Ma&s;ter wanted; there &s;he began to be acquainted with me.</P>
<P>The Women in this Countrey keep much at home, but their Minds and Affections are more wandring abroad, becau&s;e they are &s;o reclu&s;e; whereas if they had as much liberty as in other Countries, they would not be &s;o furiou&s;ly debauch'd: Their Husbands al&s;o keep &s;uch &s;trict guard over them, that when they can e&s;cape their Eyes, they <PB N="206" REF="109"> give the reins to their Pa&s;&s;ion, and labour to &s;atisfie them&s;elves more abundantly; &s;toln waters are &s;weet: The more they are forbidden and hindered from variety, the more plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction they fancy in it.</P>
<P>It is not to be imagined what tricks and invention this Woman had to draw me into her Retire|ment: She began to declare her kindne&s;s by offering unto me &s;ome pre&s;ents when I came to her Dwelling: I never went but &s;he gave me &s;omething to carry back for my &s;elf, di&s;cour&s;ing with me very freely when her Hus|band was not in the way. I did not know unto what period this growing pa&s;&s;ion might ri&s;e, nor what &s;ad con&s;equences might fol|low; therefore I did &s;hun her company as much as I could: Still &s;he laboured to win me with her <PB N="207" REF="109"> Kindne&s;s. At one time her Hus|band being not at home, a&s;&s;oon as I was entred &s;he di&s;covered her face unto me, and took me by the hand to lead me into a private Room; I followed her, not thinking at that pre&s;ent of her meaning; we were no &s;oon|er entred, but without fear or &s;hame &s;he began to wooe me with all the Expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s imaginable. I was in a little trou|ble and ha&s;te, and not willing to &s;ubmit: My re&s;i&s;tance did yet more enflame her; whiles we were thus di&s;puting, &s;he to per|&s;wade me, and I to di&s;&s;wade her, in &s;teps her Husband in the other Room next to us; his &s;udden ar|rival &s;cared us both; for we had not e&s;caped his jealous Fury, had he &s;een me in &s;o private a place with his Wife; but there was no time to deliberate, nor way <PB N="208" REF="110"> to e&s;cape but through the Door; the danger therefore made her ingenious, and find out this Ex|pedient; &s;he ro&s;e from me, and with a chearful Countenance meets her Husband at the Door, taking him by the hand, <HI>Ziddi, Ziddi,</HI> &s;aith &s;he, <HI>I am glad you are come home, in the Back-&s;ide of our hou&s;e is the &s;trangest thing that ever you &s;aw,</HI> and with that led him to &s;ee a Bea&s;t that my Ma&s;ter had &s;ent him, whil&s;t I e&s;caped a|nother way, glad to have &s;aved my life. This danger could not make the Woman wi&s;e; &s;he yet continued her Love unto me, for|cing me many times into the greate&s;t Inconveniences, becau&s;e of her doting Husband, that did &s;urprize us talking together in a too familiar manner. She did &s;till importune me with her Kindne&s;s, and by that means the old Fool <PB N="209" REF="110"> began to be &s;o affraid of me that he was ready to &s;tab me. I de|clared the bu&s;ine&s;s to my Ma&s;ter, and made him the Confident of that Love. He began to admire my Continency and good For|tune, and de&s;ired me, if I were &s;o re&s;erved, that I would plea&s;ure him by giving him a favourable Meeting with that Lady; for it &s;eems he was grown amorous of her; but her fair Face, which made her be e&s;teemed the great|e&s;t Beauty of the City, made her Husband to watch over her day and night, for fear &s;he &s;hould ta&s;t of forbidden Fruit. My Ma&s;ter was glad at this di&s;cove|ry, he grumbled at me that I had not &s;ooner declared it unto him, a&s;&s;uring me that I might have been more confident with him: I excu&s;ed my &s;elf, and told him that had I known his plea&s;ure, he
<PB N="210" REF="111"> &s;hould have been already &s;atisfi|ed. I promi&s;ed to &s;erve him faithfully in this bu&s;ine&s;s, in ca&s;e he would appea&s;e the fury of her jealous Husband, who did threat|en me with death if I came near his hou&s;e; he engaged to do it, which accordingly he performed; &s;o that I was admitted again into the Citizens dwelling, and had there the &s;ame freedom as before. The Womans pa&s;&s;ion was not &s;ca|red with her Husbands Di&s;plea|&s;ure and Jealou&s;ie; &s;he &s;till con|tinued her kindne&s;s to me: I began for my Ma&s;ters &s;ake to be more tractable; I promi&s;ed her full &s;atisfaction, but told her that I did not dare to venture into her Hou&s;e; &s;he offered me any other Rendezvous; I mentioned my Ma&s;ters Hou&s;e unto her; &s;he promi&s;ed to find &s;ome Expedient to e&s;cape thither within a day or <PB N="211" REF="111"> two; I took my leave of her, &s;ealing my Affection in the woot|ed manner, which &s;he accepted of with tho&s;e tran&s;ports of joy that become a pa&s;&s;ionate Lover. I left her full of hopes and expe|ctation, meditating upon &s;ome Expedient how to procure unto her &s;elf a &s;afe e&s;cape, free from the &s;u&s;pition of her jealous Hus|band; a thing very difficult to find, becau&s;e Jealou&s;ie hath a hundred Eyes, and many times where they &s;hould not be; the lea&s;t &s;tep abroad would but in|crea&s;e the trouble of the doating Fool, e&s;pecially if &s;he was &s;een to come in &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the Hou&s;e, be&s;ides him&s;elf, was an old Woman, and other people apt to tell Tales of one Renowned for that they would willingly have. Envy in &s;uch ca&s;es is apt to &s;peak and invent <PB N="212" REF="112"> more than is agreeable to Truth. The Ladies Love was not fright|ed with all the&s;e difficulties; it found out a way to &s;atisfie its &s;elf: As her Husband was at Supper with her, &s;he infu&s;ed into his Drink the Juice of an Herb that provoketh to &s;leep. After the repa&s;t they went to their re&s;t, &s;ending their Servants al&s;o to theirs, &s;he had been careful to take into her cu&s;tody the Keys of the Door. The poor man was no &s;ooner upon his Quilt with this amorous Woman, but he fell into a dead &s;leep; in the mean whiles, &s;he ri&s;es, and comes with all &s;peed up to the Ca&s;tle: My Ma&s;ter having been acquain|ted with all that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us, had given order to the Sentinel, not to examine too ex|actly one in a womans habit that &s;hould come at &s;uch an hour. <PB N="213" REF="112"> She found the Guard very fa|vourable to her, and my Ma&s;ters Lodging far more; for he was prepared to receive her with as much civillity as &s;he did de&s;ire: She quickly returned muffled up, and laid her &s;elf down by her drow&s;ie Husband, as if nothing had pa&s;&s;ed to his prejudice.</P>
<P>When Women once lo&s;e their hone&s;ty, nothing can keep them from that plea&s;ure which they fancy &s;o &s;weet. This Woman having found &s;o good entertain|ment at the fir&s;t, was re&s;olved to make a &s;econd tryal of our Kindne&s;s. She continued to vi|&s;it us, as often as her indu&s;try could find an e&s;cape, until the Old Mans furious Jealou&s;ie di&s;|abled her from walking abroad.</P>
<P>Had my de&s;ign been to make Conque&s;ts in the Empire of Love, I think none could have <PB N="214" REF="113"> been more happy. When a Man is got into the e&s;teem of Women, his Fame re&s;ts not in one or two Brea&s;ts, but &s;peaks as loud, and with as many tongues as the&s;e prating Crea|tures. The old Citizens Wife had whi&s;pered &s;ome of her &s;e|crets to her intimate Acquaint|ance, and they to others, &s;o that this good opinion of my Ability &s;pread &amp; increa&s;ed wonderfully in the Town; it created me ma|ny temptations, and no little trou|ble to avoid them. Had I been uncon&s;tant in Religion, I had made great advantage in this place of the Womens Kindne&s;s to me; but here I could not fix without Apo&s;tacy, which was too big a Mor&s;el for my Con&s;ci|ence to &s;wallow. That which was the mo&s;t powerful temptati|on, was offered to me by a rich <PB N="215" REF="113"> Heire&s;s, widow to a former Hus|band, of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among&s;t the Citizens; &s;he &s;ent to know from my Ma&s;ter whether he would part with me for any Money; he an&s;wered, that he could not &s;ell me becau&s;e I had de&s;erved my Freedom, and that he had promi&s;ed it unto me. When Gold (which finds in ma|ny places but a faint re&s;i&s;tance) would not do, another Expedi|ent was &s;et on foot; a Gentle|man, or an <HI>Arabian Zidi</HI> addre&s;t him&s;elf to my Ma&s;ter and me &s;e|verally, telling us his bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;hort, That there was a rich Wi|dow, no le&s;s hand&s;om, without Charge of Children, that was de&s;irous to make me her Hus|band, and to give me all her E|&s;tate if I would become <HI>Mahume|tan,</HI> and remain in that place. My Ma&s;ter hearkened to this <PB N="216" REF="114"> Propo&s;ition for the Love he had for me, &amp; began to exaggerate my good Fortune, and the happine&s;s that was offered to me, wi&s;hing me to accept of it, and not to &s;uffer &s;o great a lo&s;s for the Fan|cy of Religion. My fir&s;t Re&s;o|lution was to de&s;pi&s;e all the&s;e Of|fers, and to prefer the Life of a Slave with Honour, and my Re|ligion before the greate&s;t Riches and the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Life: I remained &s;till in it. All my Ma&s;ters per&s;wa&s;ions could not &s;hake me from it, when I con&s;i|dered within my &s;elf &s;uch an acti|on, to deny my Saviour that re|deemed me, to de&s;pi&s;e his Bloud, to renounce all intere&s;t in him, to abjure his Truth, that I knew to be &s;uch, and own an Impo&s;tor <HI>(Mahomet);</HI> to prefer him and his Diabolical Religion before that which Chri&s;t hath e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="217" REF="114"> this action appeared unto me with &s;uch an horrid A&s;pect that I was frighted from the very thoughts of it: All the Advan|tages propo&s;ed to me, the va&s;t Riches &amp; Revenues could make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon my &s;pirit; I fore&s;aw al&s;o that if I ever did in|gage my &s;elf in that Countrey by e&s;pou&s;ing &s;o great an intere&s;t in it, I &s;hould with more difficulty bring to pa&s;s my e&s;cape, and that in&s;tead of purcha&s;ing my Liber|ty at &s;uch a dear rate, I &s;hould but en&s;lave my &s;elf more, and in &s;uch a manner, that there would be &s;mall hopes left of &s;eeing a|gain my Native Soil. The&s;e Con&s;iderations pre&s;erved my mind from this powerful temp|tation, that wanted not Art, In|du&s;try and Power to &s;econd it; but when my Ma&s;ter &s;aw my di&s;|po&s;ition, and how unplea&s;ing the
<PB N="218" REF="115"> change of Religion was to me, he de&s;ired them never to mention unto me &s;uch a matter again. He would never after &s;uffer any &s;uch Propo&s;ition to be made to me, wi&s;hing that I might live and die in it. By that I perceived that he was inclined to favour Chri&s;ti|an Religion, and that Renegades are never grateful to the <HI>Turks,</HI> although they embrace their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; Uncon&s;tancy and Infide|lity are odious to them al&s;o that receive a benefit by the Traitors. My refu&s;al did di&s;appoint the
<HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Lady, but did not put a &s;top to her proceedings; &s;he imagined all the ways po&s;&s;ible to enjoy what &s;he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired. She contrived the means to &s;peak to me her &s;elf privately; &s;he laboured to trepan me, and drive me to a nece&s;&s;ity of burn|ing or turning, hoping to obtain <PB N="219" REF="115"> more ea&s;ily her end; but all was in vain: I had con&s;tancy enough, and was &s;ufficiently wary, to fru|&s;trate all her undertakings.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;aw her &s;elf di&s;ap|pointed of all her hopes, which &s;he had conceived from the for|mer means employed to woe me, &s;he gave not over; her Pa&s;&s;ion was more enflamed with this &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he there|fore re&s;olved to find out &s;ome other way, to know the truth of what was reported of me: A Curio&s;ity that co&s;t us both much trouble and hazzard of Life.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondency that &s;he aimed at was dangerous, with|out &s;omething to excu&s;e and hide it from the Eyes of the World; the be&s;t Cloak was Marriage, which &s;eeing &s;he could not ob|tain with me, was re&s;olved to take &s;ome other that might be <PB N="220" REF="116"> favourable to her Pa&s;&s;ion, and give it the liberty of &s;atisfying it &s;elf; for that intent &s;he addre&s;&s;es her &s;elf to a poor man of that place, de&s;cended from good Pa|rentage of the <HI>Moors,</HI> but his Fortunes were not an&s;werable to his Nobility; &s;everal Misfortunes had reduced him to almo&s;t a beg|ging condition, and he had lately lo&s;t by death his Wife, which during her life he was &s;carce able to maintain. The <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> Lady acquaints him by a tru&s;ty Friend with her good inclinations for him, and appoints unto him both the place and time to &s;peak with him further about this bu&s;ine&s;s; he joyfully accepts of the A&s;&s;ig|nation, hoping by this means to redeem him&s;elf and Children from extream poverty and Bon|dage: At the time he comes to the place, and there meets with <PB N="221" REF="116"> the Lady, who having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all other Company &amp; Witne&s;&s;es, freely di&s;covers unto him her Af|fection for me, and my ungrate|ful Repul&s;e, and her Re&s;olution to be&s;tow her &s;elf and Means up|on &s;uch a Husband that would not &s;earch too narrowly into her Actions, but that would give her the liberty of receiving the Vi|&s;its of tho&s;e per&s;ons that &s;he lo|ved pa&s;&s;ionately. The poor man &s;aw that what was propo&s;ed to him was offen&s;ive to his Ho|nour, but advantageous to his Pur&s;e. In the condition he was in he could not rea&s;onably refu&s;e the Offer, although it was pre|judicial to his Credit; he was therefore willing to become a Cuckold to enjoy the Riches of this Widow, hoping after Mar|riage to behave him&s;elf with her in &s;uch a manner, that he would <PB N="222" REF="117"> reclaim her from tho&s;e idle and unlawful fancies: The Conditi|on was agreed to, and all things concluded on; the Marriage was performed with as much &s;ecrecy and with as little Ceremony as was po&s;&s;ible. When it came to the knowledge of her Friends, they laboured to divert her from it, but &s;he was &s;o ob&s;tinately re&s;olved, that nothing could hin|der her from her de&s;ign; which was no &s;ooner accompli&s;hed, but &s;he laboured to find the oppor|tunity &s;he &s;ought after: Her Husband kept not his word with her; he fell into a fit of Jea|lou&s;ie, that would neither &s;uf|fer her to &s;ee the Air, nor me to come near her Dwelling; &s;o that &s;he was forced to u&s;e her wit, to get what &s;he had bar|gained for. When the Fool grew rich, he forgot his Benefactor,
<PB N="223" REF="117"> and remembred no more his en|gagement to her, never to di|&s;turb and per&s;ecute her for Acti|ons of Gallantry and Plea&s;ure. He &s;eldom met me in the &s;treets, but he &s;ought all occa&s;ions to &s;tab and &s;hoot me, daring not to vent his anger upon her, be|cau&s;e of her powerful Friends, that were not plea&s;ed with the unequal Match.</P>
<P>Whiles I remained in this place, I have run &s;everal other misfortunes; many other per|&s;ons did de&s;ire to be acquainted with me: I was once &s;o troubled with addre&s;&s;es, that I wi&s;hed my Face had been disfigured, my &s;tature more contemptible, and that all the promi&s;ing Characters of my per&s;on had never appeared in me: At la&s;t, I made my Pa|tron privy to all my Affairs; his favour did wonderfully protect
<PB N="224" REF="118"> me: None did dare to make any attempt upon my per&s;on, when he had publi&s;hed the kindne&s;s he had for me; otherwi&s;e I had ne|ver returned from this City, but had left my Bones among&s;t the&s;e Heathens. It is true, I did him &s;ometimes the favour to cau&s;e him to &s;hare with me in my good Fortune, and furthered the &s;a|tisfaction of his Inclinations, an Office not ungrateful to an old Lover, that hath &s;carce any thing acceptable in him, but the de&s;ire of well doing.</P>
<P>During this time that we did &s;pend in <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> an accident happened that cau&s;ed us to make another Journey into the Coun|trey with about 1500 men. The King of <HI>Fez, Bembouker</HI> by name, had &s;ent out a Party to &s;top a Caravan of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> that brought a con&s;iderable <PB N="225" REF="118"> quantity of Gold from the In|land Countrey to our City: There were near about thirty Cammels loaden with Gold, and other Commodities of <HI>Guiny:</HI> It &s;eems the Merchants were jea|lous of the intentions of the <HI>A|rabs</HI> about <HI>Fez,</HI> and therefore had divided their Caravan, and &s;ent &s;ix Cammels one way, with the mo&s;t contemptible part of the Goods, carrying the re&s;t by another, that whiles they did &s;eize upon the le&s;&s;er part, the greater might e&s;cape out of their Territories.</P>
<P>We had notice that a Party was upon the Road to wait for this Booty: Our Governour pre|&s;ently di&s;patch'd my Ma&s;ter with 1500 men, well armed, to watch them. We could not make &s;uch &s;peed, but they had before our arrival taken the &s;ix Cammels <PB N="226" REF="119"> loaden, and were driving them another way to <HI>Fez;</HI> a&s;&s;oon as we heard of this News, we fol|lowed them, and about ten Leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Fez,</HI> in the a&s;cent of a Mountain we o|vertook them; my Ma&s;ter was obliged in honour not to let them e&s;cape out of his hands, but to fight them, although they were far more in number than the <HI>Turks;</HI> he therefore thought it his &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e to advance before them by a &s;ecret way, and lay an Ambu&s;cado at the De&s;cent of the Mountain, where a large Wood did &s;tretch it &s;elf along the &s;ides of the next Plain; we therefore took a &s;mall compa&s;s about undi&s;covered; for they marched very &s;ecure, not dream|ing that we had intelligence of all their De&s;ignes. We arrived to the place before them; my <PB N="227" REF="119"> Ma&s;ter di&s;po&s;ed of his Compa|nies in &s;everal convenient places in the Woods, and as the <HI>Arabs</HI> came up to the middle of us, we then gave them a Salute with our Shot from both &s;ides of the way, whiles a party of our men that was behind, did ri&s;e up from the place by which the <HI>Arabs</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed, and came riding in all &s;peed to them. The Fight was de&s;perate and bloody; for al|though they were &s;urprized, they held out a longer while than we could imagin, charging us again and again, until there came up two fre&s;h Companies of choice Foot, that met them in the way that they were to pa&s;s. They were no &s;ooner perceived by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> but they began to faint, and think of a Retreat; for they were afraid to be inclo&s;ed; there|fore they all joined in a clo&s;e Bo|dy, <PB N="228" REF="120"> re&s;olving to break through tho&s;e &s;mall Numbers that lay in their way; our men divided them&s;elves on both &s;ides, and as they pa&s;&s;ed, they arre&s;ted about a hundred of the&s;e lu&s;ty Robbers, that fell to the ground half dead with the &s;hot that had wounded them. About 60 of our men lo&s;t their Lives, and about 300 <HI>Arabians</HI> left us their Hor&s;es and Cloathing for Legacies, with our own Goods that they had taken. Our Hor&s;e pur&s;ued the Enemy, but not very far for fear of a like Ambu&s;cado; the Countrey being proper for &s;uch Tricks and Sratagems of War. They brought back with them wounded &s;ome Pri&s;oners, and a few Hor&s;es. We enquired from the <HI>Blacks</HI> &amp; two of our Merchants what was be|come of the re&s;t of the Compa|ny; for we had heard how they <PB N="229" REF="120"> had &s;eparated the <HI>Caravan;</HI> they informed us of the By-way they had taken, re&s;olved to die rather than to quit their Goods: They were in number about 300 men that came with the Camels. My Ma&s;ter &s;ent all that he had recovered to <HI>Clim&s;an</HI> with a &s;mall Guard, conducting them part of the way as far as <HI>Gor&s;elveh,</HI> a &s;mall Town about ten miles di|&s;tant from <HI>Clim&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>We then marched back again with all the re&s;t of our men, to meet the other part of our <HI>Ca|ravan</HI> that was come to the Bor|ders of the Province of <HI>Segelmes,</HI> by a &s;ecret way unknown to ma|ny per&s;ons. They could never come &s;o &s;ecretly but the <HI>Arabs,</HI> (&s;ome were of tho&s;e we had beat|en) did lie in wait for them, ho|ping to meet with better Fortune <PB N="230" REF="121"> than in the former Encounters, and to recompen&s;e them&s;elves for their late Lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Our men did defend them|&s;elves de&s;perately; but had we not opportunely appeared to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they had been overpowered with the Numbers of <HI>Arabs</HI> &amp; <HI>Moors.</HI> We no &s;ooner appeared among them, which was in a Valley, watered with &s;ome Branches of the River called now by the Inhabitants <HI>Soubhir.</HI> Our People were on the other &s;ide of the River, and the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>A|rabs</HI> on this, between both was a little Ford ea&s;ie to pa&s;s. The Di&s;pute had been long when we arrived; for the Enemy did of|fer to pa&s;s, and our men did re|&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>Our coming ended the Con|tention; for they no &s;ooner &s;aw us appear, but they fled away in <PB N="231" REF="121"> all ha&s;te. We contented our &s;elves to have pre&s;erved our Goods, we did not therefore pur|&s;ue them, but marched towards <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> where our Arrival was joyfully expected; for here all the chief per&s;ons of the Town were intere&s;&s;ed. This <HI>Caravan</HI> did enrich us, and fill the City with plenty of Gold, Ivory and other Commodities, which were conveyed to <HI>Argeirs</HI> and other places on the Sea-Coa&s;t, to be tran&s;ported by Sea to
<HI>Con&s;tantino|ple.</HI></P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter and the Chief of the Party that went out, were well rewarded for their pains; the re&s;t did &s;hare among&s;t them the Hor&s;es that were taken from the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and their Cloaths, which were prized at a great &s;um of Money. My Ma&s;ter had the honour of the good &s;ucce&s;s; for <PB N="232" REF="122"> every one did attribute it to his wi&s;e Conduct and Valour. My Company was not unu&s;eful to him; for be&s;ides the Service I did render him in the fir&s;t En|gagement, I &s;aved him when he was in no little danger of his life; had I not been near to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, doubtle&s;s he had been &s;ent to convey the dead into the other world. He acknowledged my Care and Love for him by his continual Kindne&s;s for me; for he did not treat me as a Slave, but as a Friend, granting me as much Liberty as I could de|&s;ire.</P>
<P>After this Expedition we re|mained about a year in
<HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> during which time &s;everal Acci|dents hapned; the great
<HI>Mo&s;que</HI> of the City fell to the ground by a terrible Earthquake, and frighted the re&s;t of the City; a <PB N="233" REF="122"> few Hou&s;es joining to this Reli|gious place with their Inhabitants were buried in the Ruines.</P>
<P>Two Stars of a good bigne&s;s flew over the City; they were followed by &s;everal other little Lights; they met all toge|ther in one point, and made a great Star, that hung over the City about three days: The A&s;trologers and Negromancers of the Countrey were con&s;ulted about the meaning of the&s;e Me|teors; they all agreed that they were &s;ignificant and Prophetical. All the little Lights that joined to make a great one, they &s;aid were &s;everal little Principalities that would unite together to compo&s;e a great Monarchy that would not favour the <HI>Turks</HI> in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are very &s;u|per&s;titious when any &s;uch Won|ders <PB N="234" REF="123"> do appear in the Firmament; they run to their
<HI>Mo&s;quets,</HI> and fall to their Devotions, neglect|ing all other bu&s;ine&s;s many days; for they never interpret &s;uch Signes to their advantage, they look upon them as dreadful fore|runners of publick Calamities. The people of this place were &s;o much the more concerned, be|cau&s;e the&s;e Signes did appear on|ly to that Region, and did hang over their City in a threatning manner.</P>
<P>Another thing very extraordi|nary hapned about the &s;ame time: A &s;trange Mon&s;ter was born of a <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> Woman; it had the Head of an Ape, the Feet of a Goo&s;e, the Body of a Man, the Hands like the Claws of a Lion; many per&s;ons went to &s;ee it; Several Reports were &s;pread about the Town concern|ing <PB N="235" REF="123"> the&s;e unu&s;ual Accidents, which terrified the common peo|ple, &s;u&s;ceptible of fear upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion. Many Dreams al&s;o were divulged at the &s;ame time by the
<HI>Turks</HI> Enemies con|cerning the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, tend|ing to the de&s;truction of the <HI>Turks</HI> Empire in tho&s;e parts. So that there was likely to be a great Commotion, had not our Governour kept good Orders, and clapt one of the&s;e bu&s;ie Pro|phets in a deep Dungeon, to ex|pect his Relea&s;e from that Pow|er that was to de&s;troy and drive away the
<HI>Turks;</HI> but the &s;illy Ra&s;cal would never expect that Hour; he grew impatient in his Chains, &s;o that he employed &s;e|veral of his Friends to mediate for him, and procure from our Governour his Liberty, which was granted upon condition that <PB N="236" REF="124"> he would be more di&s;creet for the future, and keep his Dreams within the Circumference of his Couch.</P>
<P>Our Governour could not &s;o well order his bu&s;ine&s;s, but that the <HI>Arabs</HI> (forward enough to catch at all Occa&s;ions of ruining the
<HI>Turks</HI>) made &s;everal Parties in the Territories of this King|dom, a&s;&s;uring the Inhabitants that now was the time that they &s;hould pay no more Taxes to en|tertain the Pride and Luxury of <HI>Argiers,</HI> and that if they would lend their helping hand, it was po&s;&s;ible to recover from thence what they had &s;ent from year to year.</P>
<P>Some, as it alwaies happens on &s;uch occa&s;ions, were &s;o &s;illy to believe them; they formed there|fore &s;everal little Parties up and down; they were incon&s;iderable <PB N="237" REF="124"> &s;eparated, but had they been to|gether, they might have created us much trouble and bu&s;ine&s;s. Se|veral Companies of our Souldiers were &s;ent out to di&s;per&s;e them. The greate&s;t Body was compo&s;ed of two thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot met together about &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Clim&s;an,</HI> at a Town called <HI>Tezrim,</HI> which is &s;tony by &s;ituati|on and Art. The&s;e had killed &s;ome that favoured the <HI>Turks,</HI> and were re&s;olved to wait there to &s;ee whether any more would hap|pily join with them.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter was &s;ent out with about 1200 men only, but cho|&s;en out of the Garri&s;on: We laid &s;iege to this &s;trong place, and at the end of &s;ix days it was &s;ur|rendred to us by Compo&s;ition. The Conditions impo&s;ed were fa|vourable; the Inhabitants were condemned to deliver up their
<PB N="238" REF="125"> chief Leaders, and part with a Sum of Money. The Leaders were &s;acrificed to the <HI>Turks</HI> ven|geance, and &s;ent into the other world to rai&s;e Tumults there.</P>
<P>One thing I cannot omit very memorable in this place. At &s;ome di&s;tance from <HI>Tezrim,</HI> in a little Meadow where excellent Gra&s;s grows, I &s;aw the perfect Stature of a man Buggering his A&s;s; it was &s;o lively that at a little di|&s;tance I fancied they had been a|live, but when I came nearer, I &s;aw they were of a perfect Stone. I enquired wherefore the
<HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Arabs,</HI> that naturally hate all &s;orts of Repre&s;entations, &s;hould &s;hew their Skill by making &s;uch Bea&s;tly Figures, odious to Na|ture. I was informed that this was never made by man, but that &s;ome body of former years had been turned into this Repre&s;enta|tion
<PB N="239" REF="125"> with the A&s;s in the very mo|ment of the Bea&s;tly Act. God by his power had changed the fle&s;hly Sub&s;tances of the Man and of the A&s;s into a firm Stone, as an eternal reproach to Mankind, and a Ju&s;tification of his &s;evere Judgments again&s;t us.</P>
<P>I did further &s;earch into the Appearances of this Report, and found the Stone to repre&s;ent not only the perfect &s;hape, but al&s;o the colour of every part of the Man and of the Bea&s;t, with the Sinews, Veins, Eyes, Mouth, in &s;uch a lively manner that no Arti&s;t with all his Colours could expre&s;s it better; &s;o that I was convinced of the Truth of this Report. I did labour to move it, but &s;ome that were in compa|ny did forbid me, telling me that &s;ome have laboured to tran&s;port it from thence, but could never <PB N="240" REF="126"> away that Monument of mans &s;hameful Lu&s;t: Some have en|deavoured to their peril; either their Per&s;ons or their Cattel, that did attempt it, were &s;truck dead in the place. Gods Ju&s;tice will not &s;uffer that to be hid or de|&s;troyed that he hath placed there for all to example by it. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Moors</HI> &s;hould have &s;uch &s;ignal Tokens of Gods Di&s;plea&s;ure always before their Eyes; for they are enraged to commit &s;uch filthy Actions more frequently than other Nations.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Account of this was Printed 14 years &s;ince under the name of Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby.</HI></NOTE> I was informed by &s;ome of my Acquaintance that have been at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> that there is &s;ome &s;uch Monument of Gods Ju&s;tice near that Town about five days Jour|ney from it, towards the South-Ea&s;t <PB N="241" REF="126"> among&s;t the Mountains cal|led <HI>Gubel,</HI> far more notable than this. Many of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> prote&s;t they have &s;een &s;ome pieces of it brought by the <HI>Moors</HI> to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> and heard it confidently reported in Town as an undeniable Truth. Some of our Merchants have had the Curio&s;ity to have gone to that place, and they al&s;o prote&s;t it to be true, that in the Moun|tains about five days Journey from <HI>Tripoly</HI> there is a whole Town full of the&s;e Repre&s;enta|tions; &s;tones repre&s;enting all manner of Creatures belonging to a City, with the Hou&s;es, In|habitants, Bea&s;ts, Trees, Walls, and Rooms, very di&s;tinctly &s;hap'd. Our people have entered into the Hou&s;es, and there they have found a Child in a Cradle, of &s;tone; a Woman in a Bed, of &s;tone; a man at the Door look|ing <PB N="242" REF="127"> Lice, of &s;tone; Camels in &s;everal po&s;tures, of &s;tone; a man beating a Woman, of &s;tone; two men fighting, of &s;tone; Cats, Dogs, Mice, and all that belong|ed to the place of &s;uch perfect &s;tone, and &s;o well expre&s;&s;ing the &s;everal Shapes, Po&s;tures and Pa&s;&s;ions in which the Inhabitants were in that time, that no En|graver could do the like. Some may look upon this Relation as Fabulous, but let them enquire of our Merchants, and Traders that have been in that City of <HI>Tripoly,</HI> or in the Land, they &s;hall find them all agree in the Confirmation of this Relation. The Report that runs among&s;t the <HI>Moors</HI> is, that this Town was very populous and fruitful, as may appear by the Trees of &s;tone of &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits planted round about it, and in the places <PB N="243" REF="127"> that retain the Forms of Gardens and Orchards, when the Inhabi|tants gave them&s;elves over to all manner of Vices, to the great &s;candal of humane Nature, God in a moment &s;topp'd all their A|ctions, and turn'd their Bodies into firm Stone, that future Ages might &s;ee and learn to dread his power.</P>
<P>At <HI>Athens</HI> there is another &s;uch like Figure; a &s;tone repre|&s;enting two men buggering one another. I know no rea&s;on where|fore we &s;hould doubt of the po&s;&s;ibility of the&s;e Relations, if we con&s;ider the Almighty power of God that cau&s;eth all things to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by his Influence, and can ea&s;ily alter or change them as it &s;eems good to his Divine Wi&s;|dom. Or if we con&s;ider the ne|ce&s;&s;ity that there &s;hould be &s;uch notable Examples of Gods Ju|&s;tice <PB N="244" REF="128"> perpetuated to po&s;terity, which cannot be but by &s;ome &s;uch manner that it may expre&s;s his di&s;plea&s;ure in future Ages, e&s;pecially in this Countrey, where the People are addicted to &s;uch like Villanies that Nature it &s;elf abhors. From tho&s;e that travel into the&s;e places every one may better &s;atisfie them&s;elves concern|ing the truth of the&s;e wonderful Examples of Gods Ju&s;tice, much like that of <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife turned in|to a Pillar of Salt, which &s;ome very ancient Hi&s;torians do affirm to have &s;een remaining in their days.</P>
<P>We returned after that we had retaken all the Countrey that was revolted, with more honour than profit; for we did make war again&s;t a needy, poor, mi|&s;erable people, that had &s;carce &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; be&s;ides they <PB N="245" REF="128"> do craftily hide all their be&s;t Moveables in difficult and un|known places when they engage them&s;elves in any Revolt, that they may never lament the lo&s;s of the chief part of their &s;ub&s;tance. Sometimes hazzard brings their Enemies among&s;t their Trea&s;ury, but they are &s;o &s;ecret that no vio|lence can cau&s;e them to confe&s;s the place where it is laid up; on|ly their Cattel and other Bea&s;ts do become a Prey after the Vi|ctory. In time of peace they la|bour to redeem them by &s;tealth and Robbery; for there are no greater Thieves than the Coun|trey people of this Kingdom: If any &s;hould pa&s;s &s;ingle through their Territories, he is &s;ure to lo&s;e his Life and all that he hath, by the Pea&s;ants that profe&s;s the greate&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Turks</HI> power.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="129">At the coming of the Army from
<HI>Argiers</HI> we took our Bag and Baggage, and returned to that Maritine City. My Ma&s;ter was grown very rich and power|ful, he had got (be&s;ides a great e&s;teem which the good Services that he had rendered de&s;erved) much Wealth.

<HI>Streights</HI> Mouth all the fir&s;t quarter flood, &amp; the remainder of the Tide the flood &s;etteth from the Point of <HI>Gibralttar,</HI> We&s;t S. W. towards Cape <HI>Cabrita,</HI> at the top of high water there cometh always out of the We&s;t between the two Capes a Race of a Current which &s;preadeth the whole <HI>Streights-mouth</HI> from &s;ide to &s;ide, but con|tinues on neither &s;ide, &s;eldom longer than half an hour; but in the middle of the
<HI>Streights-mouth</HI> the Current runs to Ea&s;t|ward very &s;trong all the Tide of Ebb, and the Race of a Current falleth always, between <HI>Apes Hill</HI> and Cape <HI>Cabrita</HI> at a We&s;t and by South Moon, and at that
<PB N="249" REF="130"> in&s;tant begins the Ebb on the We&s;t &s;ide of tho&s;e two Points, to run to the We&s;tward; The Tide of Ebb on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ide runs from Cape <HI>Cabrita</HI> about two miles broad from the &s;hore as far as the I&s;land of <HI>Tariffe,</HI> and runs between the I&s;land &amp; the Main. all the Tide of Ebb along by the &s;hore towards Cape
<HI>Traffalgar,</HI> but on the South &s;ide of the I&s;land the Ebb runs very narrow except it be in a Set of fair Wea|ther. The Tide of Ebb on the
<HI>Barbary</HI> &s;ide runs from <HI>Apes Hill,</HI> but narrow along the &s;hore as far as the point <HI>Alca&s;ar,</HI> but on the We&s;t &s;ide of that point thwart of the Bay, the Tide runs about three miles broad, and at Cape <HI>Malabata</HI> which is the Ea&s;tmo&s;t point of the Bay of
<HI>Tangier,</HI> about two miles broad, and &s;o conti|nues to the We&s;tward out to <PB N="250" REF="131"> Cape <HI>Sprat,</HI> and from thence the Ebb runs South We&s;t along the &s;hore, towards <HI>Sally:</HI> The Ebb to the Ea&s;tward of Cape <HI>Cabrita</HI> &amp; <HI>Apes Hill</HI> is begun by the afore|&s;aid Race of a Current, which &s;preadeth from one &s;ide to the other, between <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Seuta</HI> Point, and runs in Ea&s;t North ea&s;t in the middle, and from the Point of <HI>Apes-Hill</HI> to the Point of
<HI>Seuta</HI> along the &s;hore all the fir&s;t half Tide; and the remaining half Tide, the Cur|rent runs from Cape <HI>Cabrita,</HI> Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t, into the <HI>Streights</HI> by the Point of <HI>Seuta;</HI> and from the Point of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> the fir&s;t half Ebb runs North-Ea&s;t into the
<HI>Streights</HI> towards Cape <HI>Fangerola,</HI> thwart of Cape
<HI>Trafflagar,</HI> about three miles di&s;tant from the &s;hore lies a Rock 9 foot under water, between which Rock and the <PB N="251" REF="131"> Cape, you may &s;ail through from the I&s;land of <HI>Tariffa;</HI> We&s;t and by South lies a Ledge of Rocks, 8, 9, and 10 Foot under water, which may be &s;een in foul Weather by the Breach of the Sea. At the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land of
<HI>Tariffa</HI> is a good Rode for a We&s;terly Wind, in which you may Anchor between 20 and 13 fathom Water in clear hard ground, but come not to an An|chor nearer to the I&s;land than 13 Fathom, becau&s;e near the South-ea&s;t Point of the I&s;land is foul ground; the be&s;t of this Rode is with the South-we&s;t Point of the I&s;land, We&s;t South-we&s;t from you, and the Sand Hill We&s;t-North-we&s;t, and there you &s;hall find 14. Fathom water clear ground. Between this I&s;land &amp; Cape <HI>Cabrita</HI> there is no danger, but what always lies above Wa|ter; <PB N="252" REF="132"> in the middle of this Bay is a Light-Hou&s;e, thwart of which you may Anchor in 12 Fathom Water, clear ground; a fine di|&s;tance from the &s;hore, one third part of the di&s;tance from this Light-hou&s;e towards the Cape is 12 Fathom, the ground blew Clay, and that is a good Rode for a North-ea&s;t Wind, you may borrow on the Cape, the Rocks to the We&s;tward of the Cape to 5 Fathom, and on the Ea&s;t &s;ide to 7 Fathom, a little to the We&s;tward of the We&s;tern Point of the Bay of
<HI>Gibraltar,</HI> thwart of a little Valley in the fair way between this Point and Cape <HI>Cabrita</HI> is a Rock 8 Foot under Water, and by the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this Rock is 12 Fathom. At the Point of Cape <HI>Malabata</HI> lies a Ledge of Rocks joining to the Land that &s;tretcheth a little
<PB N="253" REF="132"> way into the Sea, but all above Water, and you &s;hall have five fathom water fair by the Rocks: Note the Tide of Ebb runs very &s;trong to the We&s;tward by this Point, round the Bay of <HI>Tangier;</HI> To Anchor in the Bay of <HI>Tangier,</HI> in clear ground, bring the Ca&s;tle that &s;tands on the North-we&s;t Corner of the Town, over the North Wall of the Town, and Cape <HI>Malabata</HI> North-ea&s;t, and there is between 9 &amp; 10 Fathom water at a full Sea.</P>
<P>To turn through the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth, the Wind being we&s;ter|ly, you mu&s;t ply to Windward on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ide from the point of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> to Cape <HI>Cabrita,</HI> and from thence to the I&s;land of <HI>Ta|reffa,</HI> but you mu&s;t turn about the Cape a little before a high Water, that you may have time to make two or three &s;hort
<PB N="252" REF="133"> Boards to the We&s;tward of the Cape before the Race of a Cur|rent comes out of the We&s;t, which continues but a very little while; which being pa&s;t, the Ebb begins to run to the We&s;tward, which runs &s;o &s;trong that you may turn up to the I&s;land in one Tide of Ebb, (but if you can|not, you may &s;top the Flood any where betweeen the Cape and the I&s;land in 12, or 14 Fathom water) and there you mu&s;t An|chor until &s;o much of the Flood be &s;pent, that you may get over to the <HI>Barbary</HI> &s;ide, to take the fir&s;t of the Ebb there; and if you fall a little to the We&s;tward of the Point <HI>Alca&s;ara,</HI> you may get into the Bay of <HI>Tangier</HI> by a low Water, from whence you may, ob&s;erving the Tide, turn out at plea&s;ure.</P>
