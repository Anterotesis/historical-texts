<HEAD>Sir Walter Rawleigh
his Apologie.</HEAD>
<P>IF ill successe of this En|terprise
of mine had bin
without Example, I
should have needed a
large discourse and ma|ny
arguments for my
Justification, But if the atempts of the
greatest Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> both among
themselves and against the great Turk,
are in all moderne Histories left to e|very
eye to peruse. It is not so strange
that my selfe being but a private man,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and drawing after me the chaines and
Fetters whereunto I have been thirteen
yeares tyed in the Tower, being un|pardoned
and in disgrace with my So|veraigne
Lord, have by other mens er|rours
failed in the attempt I under|tooke.</P>
<P>For if that <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth return|ed
with unexampled losse, I will not
say dishonour, from <HI>Algire</HI> in <HI>Africa:</HI>
If King <HI>Sebastian</HI> lost himselfe and his
Army in <HI>Barbary:</HI> If the invincible
Fleet and forces of <HI>Spaine</HI> in Eighty
Eight were beaten home by the Lord
<HI>Charles Howard</HI> Admirall of <HI>England:</HI>
If Mr. <HI>Strozzi</HI> the Count <HI>Brizack</HI>
the Count of <HI>Vinnnoso</HI> and others, with
the Fleet of fifty eight sayle and six
thousand Souldiers, encountered with
far lesse numbers could not defend the
<HI>Terceres.</HI> Leaving to speake of a world
of other attempts furnished by Kings
and Princes. If Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI>
Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Bas|kervile</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
men for their experience and
valour as Eminent as <HI>England</HI> had a|ny,
strengthned with divers of her Ma|jesties
ships, and fild with Souldiers
at will, could not possesse themselves of
the Treasure they sought for, which in
their view was imbarked in certaine
Frigotts at <HI>Puerto Rico,</HI> yet afterward
they were repulsed with fifty Negroes
upon the Mountains of <HI>Vasques Numi|us,</HI>
or <HI>Sierra de Capira</HI> in their passage
towards <HI>Panania:</HI> If Sir <HI>Iohn Norris</HI>
(though not by any fault of his) failed
in the attempts of <HI>Lysbone</HI> and returned
with the losse, by sicknesse and other|wise,
of eight thousand men. What
wonder is it, but that mine (which is
the last) being followed with a com|pany
of Voluntiers who for the most
part had neither seen the Sea nor the
Warres, who, some forty Gentlemen
excepted, had we the very scumme of
the World: Drunkards, Blasphemers
and such others as their Fathers Bro|thers
<PB N="4" REF="4">
and freinds thought it an exceed|ing
good gaine to be discharged of
them with the hazard of some thirty
forty or fifty pounds, knowing they
could not have liv'd a whole yeare so
cheape at home: I say what wonder is
it, if I have failed, where I could neither
be present my selfe, nor had any of the
Commanders (whom I most trusted)
living, or in state to supply my place?</P>
<P>Now, where it was bruted, both be|fore
my departure out of <HI>England</HI> and
by the most men beleived, that I meant
nothing lesse then to go to <HI>Guiana:</HI> but
that being once at liberty and in mine
owne power, having made my way
with some Forraigne Prince I would
turne Pyratt and utterly forsake my
Countrey. My being at <HI>Guiana,</HI> my
returning into <HI>England</HI> unpardoned,
and my not takeing the spoile of the
Subj. of any Christian Prince, hath (I
doubt not) destroyed that Opinion.</P>
<P>But this is not all: for it hath been
<PB N="5" REF="4">
given out by an hypocritticall Theife
who was the first Master of my shipp:
And by an ungratefull Youth which
waited upon me in my Cabbin,
though of honourable worthy Parents:
and by others: That I carryed with me
out of <HI>England</HI> twenty two thousand
peices of twenty two shillings the
peice, and thererefore needed not, or
cared not to discover any Mine in <HI>Gui|ana,</HI>
nor make any other attempt else|where:
Which Report being carried
secretly from one to an other in my
ship, and so spread through all the
ships in the Fleet which staid with me
at <HI>Trenidado</HI> while our Land-Forces
were in <HI>Guiana,</HI> had like to have been
my utter overthrow in a most misera|ble
fashion; For it was consulted
when I had taken my Barge and gone
a shoare (either to discover or otherwise
as I often did) That my ship should
have set saile and left me there, where
either I must have suffered Famine,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
been eaten with wilde beasts, or have
fallen into the hands of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
and been flayed alive as others of the
<HI>English,</HI> which came thither but to
trade only, had formerly been.</P>
<P>To this Report of Riches, I make
this Protestation, That if it can be
prooved, either now or hereafter, that
I had in the world, either in my keep|ing
or in my power, either directly or
indirectly in trust or otherwise, above
one hundred peices when I departed
<HI>London,</HI> of which I had left forty five
peices with my wife, and fifty five I
carried with me: I acknowledge my
selfe for a Reprobate, a Villaine, a
Traitor to the King, and the most un|worthy
man that doth live, or ever hath
liv'd upon the earth.</P>
<P>Now where the Captaines that left
me in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Baily,</HI>
that ran away from me at <HI>Cancerota,</HI>
have, to excuse themselves, objected
for the first, <HI>That</HI> I <HI>lingered at</HI> Pli|mouth
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<HI>when I might have gone thence,
and lost a faire Wind and time of the
yeare, or to that effect.</HI> It is strange that
men of fashion and Gentlemen should
so grosly bely their owne knowledge:
And that had not I lived nor returned to
have made answer to this Faction, yet
all that know us in <HI>Plimouth</HI> and all
that we had to deale withall knew the
contrary. For after I had stayed at the
Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> divers daies; the <HI>Thunder,</HI>
Commanded by Sir <HI>Warram St. Leger</HI>
by the negligence of her Master, was at
Lee in the <HI>Thames;</HI> and after I arrived
at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> Captaine <HI>Pennington</HI> was
not come then to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and
being arrived there, and not able to
redeeme his Bread from the Ba|kers,
he rode back to <HI>LONDON</HI>
to intreat help from my wife to pay
for it, who having not so much money
to serve his turne, she wrote to Mr.
<HI>Wood</HI> of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> and gave him her
word for thirty pounds, which shee
<PB N="8" REF="6">
soone after payd him, without which
(as <HI>Pennington</HI> himselfe protested to
my wife) he had not bin able to have
gone the journey: Sir <HI>Iohn Ferne</HI> I
found there without all hope of being
able to proceed, having nor men nor
mony, and in great want of other pro|vision,
insomuch as I furnished him
by my Cozen <HI>Herbert</HI> with a hundred
pounds, having supplied himselfe in
<HI>Wales</HI> with a hundred pounds before
his coming to <HI>Plimouth:</HI> and procured
him a third hundred pound from the
worthy and honest Deane of <HI>Exeter</HI>
Doctor <HI>Sutcliffe.</HI> Captaine <HI>Whitney,</HI>
whome I also stayed for, had a third
part of his victualls to provide, inso|much
as having no mony to help him
withall I sold my Plate in <HI>Plimouth</HI> to
supply him. <HI>Baily</HI> I left at the <HI>Isle of
Wight,</HI> whose arrivall I also attended
here some ten or twelve daies as I re|member,
and what should move <HI>Baily</HI>
only to leave me as he did at the <HI>Cana|ries,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
from whence he might have de|parted
with my love and leave, and at
his returne to do me all the wrong he
could devise, I cannot conceive; he
seemed to me from the begining not to
want any thing, he only desired of me
some Ordnance and some iron-bound
Caske, and I gave it him; I never gave
him ill language nor offered him the
least unkindnesse to my knowledge:
It is true, that I refused him a French
Shallop which he tooke in the Bay of
<HI>Portingall</HI> outward bound, and yet af|ter
I had bought her of the French, and
paid fifty Crownes ready mony for her
if <HI>Baily</HI> had then desired her he might
have had her; But to take any thing
from the <HI>French,</HI> or from any other na|tion,
I meant it not.</P>
<P>True it is, that as many things succee|ded
both against Reason and our best
endeavours; So it is most commonly
true, that men are the cause of their
owne misery, as I was of mine, when I
<PB N="10" REF="7">
undertooke my late enterprise without
a pardon for all my Company, ha|ving
heard it avowed in <HI>England</HI> be|fore
they went, that the Commission
I had, was granted to a man who was
<HI>Non Ens</HI> in law, so hath the want
thereof taken from me both Armes
and Actions: Which gives boldnesse
to every petty Companion to spread
Rumours to my Defamation and the
wounding of my Reputation, in all
places where I cannot be present to
make them Knaves and Lyars.</P>
<P><HI>It hath been secondly objected,</HI> That
I put into <HI>Ireland</HI> and spent much time
there, taking care to Revictuall my selfe
and none of the rest.</P>
<P>Certainly I had no purpose to see
<HI>Ireland</HI> when I left <HI>Plimouth,</HI>
but be|ing encountered with a strong Storme
some eight Leagues to the Westward
of <HI>Scilly,</HI> in which Captaine <HI>Chudleyes</HI>
Pinace was suncke, and Captaine <HI>King</HI>
thrust into <HI>Bristoll:</HI> I held it the Of|fice
<PB N="11" REF="7">
of a Commander of many ships,
and those of divers Saylings and con|ditions,
of which some could Hull
and Trye, and some of them beat it
up upon a Tack, and others neither
able to doe the one nor the other,
rather to take a Port and keep his
Fleete together, then either to en|danger
the losse of Masts and Yardes;
or to have it severed farre asunder, and
to be thrust into divers places. For the
attendance of meeting them againe at
the next Randezvous, would consume
more Time and Victuall, and per|chance
the weake ships might be set
upon, taken, or disordered, then
could be spent by recovering a Har|bour,
and attending the next change of wind.</P>
<P>That the dissevering of Fleets hath
beene the overthrow of many Acti|ons,
I could give many Examples,
were it not in every mans Know|ledge.
In the last Enterprize of
<PB N="12" REF="8">
worth, undertaken by our <HI>English</HI> Na|tion
with three Squadrons of ships,
Commanded by the Earle of <HI>Essex,</HI>
the Earle of <HI>Suffolke</HI> and my selfe,
where was also present the Earle of
<HI>Southampton,</HI> If we being storme-bea|ten
in the Bay of <HI>Alcashar</HI> or <HI>Biscaye</HI>
had had a Port under our Lee, that we
might have kept our Transporting
ships with our men of War, we had
in all likelihood both taken the <HI>Indian</HI>
Fleet and the <HI>Asores.</HI></P>
<P>That we staid long in <HI>Ireland</HI> it is
true, but they must accuse the Clouds
and not me, for our stay there; for I
lost not a day of a good Wind: and
there was not any Captaine of the
Fleet but had Credit or might have
had for a great deale of more victualls
then we spent there, and yet they had
of me fifty Beeves among them and
somewhat else.</P>
<P>For the third Accusation, <HI>That I
landed in Hostile maner at</HI> Lancerota;
<PB N="13" REF="8">
Certainly Captaine <HI>Baily</HI> had greate
want of matter when he gave that for
an excuse of his turning back, for I re|ferr
my selfe to Mr. <HI>Barney,</HI> who I
know will ever justifie a truth, to
whom (when he came to me from
Captaine <HI>Baily</HI> to know whether he
should land his men with the rest) I
made this answer, that he might land
them if it pleased him, or otherwise
keepe them aboard, for I had agreed
with the Governor for a proportion of
victuall which I hourely expected:
And it is true, that the Governor being
desirous for to speake with me with
one Gentleman with him with their
Rapiers only, which I accepting, and
taking with me Leivetenant <HI>Bradshaw,</HI>
we agreed: that I should send up an
<HI>English</HI> Factor (whose ship did then
ride in the Roade) and that whatsoe|ver
the Island could yeeld should be
delivered at a reasonable rate; I sent
the English Factor according to our a|greement,
<PB N="14" REF="9">
but the Governour put it off
from one morning to an other, and in
the end sent me word, that except I
would imbarque my men which lay on
the Sea side, <HI>Slanders</HI> were so jealous
as they durst not sever themselves to
make our Provisions: I did so, but
when the one halfe were gotten aboard
two of our Centinells forc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">, one slaine
and the English Factor sent to tell
mee that he had nothing for us, whom
he still believed to be a Fleet of the
Turks, who had lately taken and de|stroyed
<HI>Puerto Sancto.</HI> Hereupon all
the Companies would have marched
toward the Towne and have sackt it,
but I knew it would not only dislike
His Majesty; But that our Merchants
having a continuall trade with those I|slands,
that their Goods would have bin
stayed, and amongst the rest, the poor
English man riding in the Road ha|ving
all that he brought thither ashore,
would have been utterly undone.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="9">Hereof I complained to the Go|vernour
of the Grand <HI>Canaries,</HI> whom
I also desired that we might take wa|ter
without any disturbance, but in|stead
of answer, when we landed some
hundred men, far from any habitation,
and in a Desart place of the Island,
where we found some fresh water,
there Ambush was layd, and one <HI>Fish|er</HI>
of Sir <HI>Iohn Fernes</HI> ship wounded to
death, and more had been slain had not
Captaine <HI>Thornhurst</HI> and Master <HI>Robert
Hayman</HI> my sonnes Lievtenant, two
exceeding valiant Gentlemen, who
first made head against them, second|ed
by Sir <HI>Warham Sentleger</HI> and my
Sonne with halfe a dozen more, made
sorty of them runne away. From hence
because there was scarcity of water,
we sayled to <HI>Gomarrah,</HI> one of the
strongest and well defenced places of
all the Islands and the best Port: The
Towne being seated upon the very
Wash of the Sea, at the first entrance
<PB N="16" REF="10">
of our ships, they shot at us, and ours
at them, but as soone as I my selfe re|covered
the Harbour, and had com|manded
that there should be no more
shooting, I sent a Spaniard a shore (ta|ken
in a Barque which came from <HI>Cape
Blanke</HI>) to tell the Governour that I
had no purpose to make warr with any
of the Spanish Kings Subjects, and if
any harme were done by our great Ord|nance
to the Towne, it was his fault,
which by shooting first gave the occa|sion.
He sent me for answer that he
thought we had beene the Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">kish
Fleet, which destroyed <HI>Puerto Sancto,</HI>
but being resolved by the Messenger
that we were Christians and English,
and sought nothing but water, he
would willingly afford us as much as
we pleased to take, if he might be as|sured
that we would not attempt his
Towne-Houses, nor destroy the Gar|dens
and fruits; I returned him answer
that I would give him my Faith, and
<PB N="17" REF="10">
the word of the King of Great Brit|taigne
my Soveraigne Lord, that the
People of the Town and Island should
not loose so much as one Orange or a
Grape w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">thout paying for it, I would
hang him up in the Market-street.
Now that I kept my Faith with him,
and how much he held himselfe bound
unto me: I have divers of his Letters to
shew, for he wrote unto me every day
And the Countesse being of an english
Race a <HI>Stafford</HI> by Mother, and of the
house of <HI>Horn</HI> by the Father, sent me
divers presents of fruits, Sugar, and
Ruske: to whom I returned because
I would not depart in her debt) things
of greater value; The old Earle at my
departure wrot a Letter to the Spanish
<HI>Ambassador</HI> here in <HI>England</HI> how I
had behaved my selfe in those Islands.
There I discharg'd a Barke of the grand
<HI>Canaries</HI> taken by one of my Pinna|ces
coming from <HI>Cape-Blank</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI>
and demanding of him what prejudice
<PB N="18" REF="11">
he had recieved by being taken, he told
me that my men had eaten of his fish
to the value of sixe Duckers, for which
I gave him eight.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Canaries,</HI> it is said <HI>That
I sayled to</HI> Cape de Verte <HI>knowing it to
be an insec<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">ious place, by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">eason whereof I
lost so many of my men ere I recovered the</HI>
Indies; The tru<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">h sis that I came no ne|rer
to <HI>Cape de Vert</HI> then <HI>Bravo,</HI> which is
one hundred and sixty Leagues off; But
had I taken it in my way, falling upon
the Coast or any other part of <HI>Guiana,</HI>
after the Raine, there is as little dan|ger
of insection as in any other part of
the World, as our English that trade
in those parts every yeare doe well
know; There are few places in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
or in the world neere great Ri|vers
which run through low grounds
or neare Moorish or Marsh grounds,
but the People inhabiting neare, are at
some time of the yeare subject to Fea|ver<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">,

admitts no Examination, so the con|trary
allows of no excuse, how reason|able
or just soever. Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Iohn Winter</HI> and <HI>Iohn Tomas,</HI> when
they past the Streights of <HI>Malegan,</HI>
mee<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">ing with a storme which drove
<HI>Winter</HI> back, which thrust <HI>Iohn Thomas</HI>
upon the Islands to the South where
he was cast away, and Sir <HI>Francis</HI> nere
a small Island upon which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
landed their cheins &amp; murderers,
from <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and he found there <HI>Phil|lip</HI>
an Indian who told him where he
was and conducted him to <HI>Baldivia,</HI>
wher he took his first prize of Treasure
<PB N="20" REF="12">
and in that ship he found a Pylot cal|led
<HI>John Grege</HI> who guided him all that
Coast, in which he possest himselfe
of the rest, which Pylot because he
should not rob him of his Reputation
and knowledge in those parts (desist|ing
the intreaties and teares of all his
Company) he set him a shore up|on
the Island of <HI>Altegulors</HI> to be by
them devoured. After which passing
by the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> he returned into
<HI>England,</HI> and notwithstanding the
peace between Us and <HI>Spaine,</HI> he en|joyed
the Riches he brought, and was
never so much as called to accompt for
cutting off <HI>Douly</HI> his head at <HI>Porte St.
Iulian</HI> having neither Marshall Law
nor other Commission availeable. Mr.
<HI>Candish</HI> having past all the Coasts of
<HI>Chyle</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and not gotten a far|thing,
when he was without hope, and
re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">dy to shape his course by the East
homewards, met a ship which came
from the <HI>Phillippines</HI> at <HI>Calestorvia,</HI> a
<PB N="21" REF="12">
thousand pounds to a Nutshell. These
two in these two Voyages were the
Children of Fortune, and much hono|red;
But when Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in his
last attempt might have landed at <HI>Cru|ces,</HI>
by the river of <HI>Chyagre</HI> within eight
miles of <HI>Panama,</HI> he notwithstanding

he dyed for s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">rrow. The same successe
had <HI>Candish</HI> in his last Passage towards
the Streights. I say that one and the

and <HI>Candish,</HI> when Chance had left
them to the tryall of their owne Ver|tues.</P>
<P>For the rest I leave to all worthy
and indifferent men to judge, by what
neglect or errour of mine, the Gold
Mine in <HI>Guiana</HI> which I had formerly

then be well advised how you land, for
I know (that a few Gentlemen excep|ted)
what a Scumme of men you have,

<P>That these my Instructions were not

seemes that the Sergeant-Major, <HI>Key|mis</HI>

distant from the place where <HI>Antonio

and meaning to rest themselves on the

were in the night set upon and char|ged

unlooked for, the Common sort
of them were so amazed, as had
not the Captaines and some other
valiant Gentlemen made a Head and
encouraged the rest, they had all been
broken and cut in pieces. To repell this
force putting themselves in order, they
charged the Spaniards, and following
them upon their retreat they were rea|dy
to enter the Town, ere they knew
where they were, and being then char|ged
againe by the Governour, and foure

Companies; My Sonne not tarrying

of a company of Pikes, where he was

</LETTER>
<P>Now it seemes that the death of my
Son, fearing also (as he told me when
he came to <HI>Trinidado</HI>) that I was ei|ther
dead of my first sicknesse, or that
the news of my Sonnes death would
have hastened my end, made him re|solve
not to open the Myne, to the
which he added for excuse, and I thinke
it was true, that the Spaniards being
gone off in a whole body, lay in the
Woods betweene the Myne and their
passage, that it was impossible, except
they had bin beaten out of the Coun|try,
to passe up the Woody and Crag|gy
Hills without the losse of those
Commanders which should have lead
them, who had they been slaine, the rest,
would easily enough have bin cut in
<PB N="36" REF="20">
pieces in their retreate; for being in
possession of the towne, which they
guarded with the greatest part of three
Companies, they had yet their handfull
to defend themselves from fireing, and
the daily and nightly Alarums, where|with
they were vexed. He also gave
forth the excuse that it was impossible
to lodge any Companies at the Myne,
for want of Victuall, which from the
towne they were not able to carry up
the mountaine their Companies being
divided; He therefore as he told me
thought it a greater error to discover it
to the Spaniards, themselves neither
being able to worke it, nor possesse it
then to excuse himselfe to the Com|pany,
said that he could not find it; all
which his fancies when I received, and
before divers of the Gentlemen disa|vowed
his ignorance, for I told him
That a blind man might find it, by the
marks which himself had set down un|der
his hand, and that I told him that his
<PB N="37" REF="20">
care of loosing so many men in passing
through the Woods, was but fained,
for after my Sonne was slaine, I knew
that he had no care at all of any man
surviving, and therefore had he brought
to the King but one hundred weight of
the oare though with the losse of one
hundred men, He had given his Maje|sty
satisfaction, preserved my reputa|tion,
and given our Nation encou|ragement
to have returned this next
yeare, with greater force and to have
held the Country for his Majesty to
whom it belonged, and of which him|selfe
had given the testimony, that be|sides
the excellent ayre, pleasantnesse,
healthfulnesse, and riches: it hath plen|ty
of Corne, Fruits, Fish, Fowle, wild
and tame, Beeves, Horses, Sheepe, Hogs,
Deeres, Coneys, Hares, Tortoyses, Ar|madiles,
Wanaes, Oyles, Hony, Wax,
Potatoes, Suger Canes, Medicaments,
Balsamum, Simples, Gums, and what
not; but seeing he had followed his
<PB N="38" REF="21">
owne advice, and not mine, I should
be forced to leave him arguments with
the which if he could satisfy his Maje|sty,
and the State, I should be glad of
it, though for my part he must excuse
me to justify it, that he, if it had plea|sed
him, though with some losse of
men might have gone directly to the
place: with that he seemed greatly dis|content,
and so he continued divers
dayes; afterward he came to me in my
Cabbin, and shewed me a Letter which
he had written to the Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI>
to whom he excused himself, for not
discovering of the Myne: using the
same arguments, and many others
which he had done before, and prayed
me to allow of his Apology; but I told
him that he had undone me by his ob|stinacy,
and that I would not favour or
collour in any sort his former folly.
He then asked me, whether that were
my resolution, I answered, that it was:
he then replyed in these words, I know
<PB N="39" REF="21">
not then Sir what course to take; and
went out of my Cabbin into his own,
in which he was no sooner entred, but
I heard a Pistoll goe off. I sent up (not
suspecting any such thing as the killing
of himselfe) to know who shot a Pi|stoll,
<HI>Keymis</HI> himself made answer ly|ing
on his Bed, that he had shot it off,
because it had been long charged, with
which I was satisfied; some half houre
after this, the Boy going into his Cab|bin,
found him dead, having a long
knife thrust under his left pap through
his heart, and his Pistoll lying by him,
with which it appeared that he had
shot himselfe, but the Bullet lighting
upon a rib, had but broken the rib and
went no further. Now he that knew
<HI>Keymis,</HI> did also know that he was of
that obstinate resolution, and a man so
far from caring to please or satisfie any
man but my selfe, as no mans opinion
from the greatest to the least could
have perswaded him to have laid vio|lent
<PB N="40" REF="22">
hands on himselfe, neither would
he have done it, when he did it, could
he have said unto me, that he was ig|norant
of the Place, and knew no such
Myne; for what cause had I then to
to have rejected his excuses, or to have
laid his obstinacy to his charge; thus
much I have added, because there are
some Puppies which have given it out,
that <HI>Keymis</HI> slew himselfe because he
had seduced so many Gentlemen and
others with an imaginary Myne; but
as his Letter to me the 8. of <HI>Ianuary</HI>
proves that he was then resolved to o|pen
it, and to take off all these kinds of
objections; Let Captaine <HI>Charls Par|ker,</HI>
Captaine <HI>George Ralegh</HI> and Cap|taine
<HI>King</HI> all living and in <HI>England;</HI>
be put to their oaths whether or no
<HI>Keymis</HI> did not confesse to them com|ming
down the River, at a place where
they cast anker, that he could from
that place have gone to the Myne in
two hours, I say then that if the opening
<PB N="41" REF="22">
of the Myne had bin at that time to a|ny
purpose; or had they had had any
victualls left then, to bring them away,
or had they not been hastned by seeing
the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Letters before
they came to my hands, which I am
assured <HI>Keymis</HI> had seene who delivered
them to me, whereof one of them was
dated at <HI>Madrill</HI> the 17 of <HI>March</HI> be|fore
I left the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and
with it, three other dispatches with
a Commission for the strengthning of
<HI>Orrenoque</HI> with 150 Souldiers, which
should have come downe the River
from the new Kingdome of <HI>Granada;</HI>
and one other 150 from <HI>Puerto Rico</HI>
with ten pieces of Ordnance which
should have come up the River from
the entrance, by which two Troupes
they might have bin inclosed, I say had
not the rest seene those dispatches; and
that having stayed in the River above
two months, they feared the hourely
arrivall of those forces, why had they
<PB N="42" REF="23">
not constrained <HI>Keymis</HI> to have brought
them to the Myne, being as himselfe
confesses within two houres march.
Againe, had the Companies Com|manders
but pincht the Governours
man whom they had in their possession,
he could have told them of two or three
Gold Mynes and a Silver Myne not a|bove
foure miles from the Towne, and
given them the names of their posses|sors;
with the reason why they for|bare
to worke them at that time, and
when they left off from working them,
which they did aswell because they
wanted Negroes, as because they feared
least the English, French, or Dutch
would have forced them from those
being once thoroughly opened, having
not sufficient strength to defend them|selves;
But to this, I have heard it said
since my returne, that the Governours
man was by me perswaded, being in my
power, to say that such Mynes there
were, when indeed there was no such
<PB N="43" REF="23">
thing, Certainly they were but silly
fooles, that discovered this subtilty of
Mine, who having not yet by the long
Calenture that weakened me, lost all
my wits which I must have done, if I
had left my reputation in trust with a
<HI>Malato,</HI> who for a pot or two of Wine,
for a dozen of Hatchets, or a gay suite
of apparell would have confessed, that
I had taught him to speake of Mynes,
that were not in <HI>Rerum natura,</HI> No I
protest before the Majesty of God, that
without any other agreements or pro|mises
of mine, then well usage, he hath
discovered to me, the way to five or
sixe of the richest Mynes which the
Spaniards have, and from whence, all
the Masse of Gold that comes into
<HI>Spaine</HI> in effect is drawne.</P>
<P>Lastly, when the Ships were come
downe the River as farre as <HI>Carapana's</HI>
Country (who was one of the naturall
Lords) and one that reserved that part
of <HI>Guiana</HI> to her Maje. hearing that the
<PB N="44" REF="24">
English had abandoned St. <HI>Thome,</HI>
and left no force in the Country, which
he hoped they would have done, hee
sent a great Canooe with store of fruits
and Provisions to the Captains, and by
one of his men which spake Spanish,
having as it seemed bin long in their
hands; hee offered them a rich Gold
Myne in his own Country, knowing it
to be the best argument to perswade
their stay, and if it please them to send
up any one of the English to view it, he
would leave sufficient pledges for his
safe returne. Master <HI>Leake,</HI> Master
<HI>Moleneux</HI> and others offering them|selves,
which when the greater part re|fused
(I know not by what reason lead)
he sent againe, leaving one of his men
still aboard to entreate them to tarry
but two dayes, and he himselfe would
come to them, and bring them a sample
of the oare: for he was an exceeding
old man, when I was first in the Coun|try
some twenty foure yeares since,
<PB N="45" REF="24">
which being also neglected, and the
Ships under saile; he not withstanding
sent a Boat after them to the very
mouth of the River in hope to per|swade
them: that this is true, witnesse
Captaine <HI>Parker,</HI> Captaine <HI>Leake,</HI>
Master <HI>Stresham,</HI> Master <HI>Maudict,</HI> Ma|ster
<HI>Moleneux,</HI> Master <HI>Robert Hamon,</HI>
Master <HI>Nicholes,</HI> Captaine <HI>King, Pe|ter
Andrews,</HI> and I know not how ma|ny
others; but besides his offer also,
there hath not been wanting an argu|ment
though a foolish one; which was
that the Spaniards, had employed the
Indians with a purpose to betray our
men, but this treason had been easily
prevented, if they had stayed the old
mans comming; who would have
brought them the Gold oare aboarde
their Ships, and what purpose could
there be of treason when the Guiani|ans
offered to leave pledges six for one,
yea one of the Indians which the Eng|lish
had aboarde them, whom they
<PB N="46" REF="25">
found in fetters when they tooke the
towne of St. <HI>Thome</HI> could have told
them, that the Cassique which sent un|to
them to shew them the Gold Myne
in his Country, was unconquered; and
are enemies to the Spaniard, and could

them with a pretence of Gold, when
neither <HI>Keymis</HI> nor my selfe knew of
any in those parts: if it had bin to have
gotten my liberty, why did I not keep
my liberty when I had it, Nay why did
I put my life in manifest peril to forgo
it? if I had had a purpose to have tur|ned
Pyrate, why did I oppose my
self against the greatest number of my
Company, and was there by in danger
to be slaine or cast into the Sea because
I refused it?</P>
<P>A strange fancy had it been in me
to have perswaded my Sonne whom I
have lost, and to have perswaded my
Wife to have adventured the 8000. l.
which his Majesty gave them for <HI>Sher|bone,</HI>
and when that was spent, to per|swade
my Wife to sell her house at
<HI>Micham,</HI> in hope of inriching them by
<PB N="48" REF="26">
the Mynes of <HI>Guiana;</HI> if I my self had
not seene them with my owne eyes;
for being old and weakely, thirty years
in prison, and not used to the ayre to
travell and to watching, it being ten
to one that I should ever have returned,
and to which by reason of my violent
sicknesse, and the long continuance
thereof, no man had any hope, what
madnesse could have made me under|take
this journey but the assurance of
the Myne, thereby to have done his
Majestie service, to have bettered my
Country by the trade, and to have re|stored
my Wife and Children their
States; they had lost for that, I have
refused all other ways or means, for
that I had a purpose to have changed
my Master, and my Country, my re|turne
in the state I did returne may
satisfie every honest and indifferent
man.</P>
<P>An unfortunate man I am, and it is
to me a greater losse then all I have
<PB N="49" REF="26">
lost, that it pleaseth his Majestie to be
offended for the burning of a Spanish
towne in <HI>Guiana;</HI> of which these
parts bordering the River <HI>Orrenoque,</HI>
and to the South as farre as the Ama|zones
doth by the Law of Na<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">ions be|long
to the Crowne of <HI>England,</HI> as
his Majestie was well resolved when I
prepared to goe thither, otherwise his
Majesty would not have given once
leave to have landed there; for I set it
downe under my hand that I intended
that enterprise and nothing else, and
that I meant to enter the Country by
the River of <HI>Orrenoque;</HI> It was not
held to be a breach of peace neither by
the State here nor the Spanish Ambas|sadour
who knew it aswell as I, that I
pretended the journy of <HI>Guiana</HI> which
he alwaies held to be a pretence; for he
said it to Master Secretary <HI>Windode</HI> and
to others of my Lords; that if I meant
to sayle to <HI>Guiana,</HI> and had no intent
to invade any part of his Majesties
<PB N="50" REF="27">
West Indies nor his Fleets, I should
not need to strengthen my selfe as I
did, for I should worke any Myne
there, without any disturbance and in
peace, to which I made answer, that I
had set it under my hand to his Majest.
that I had no other purpose, nor meant
to undertake any thing else; but for the
rest, that Sir <HI>Iohn Haukins</HI> in his jour|ney,
to St. <HI>Iohn de Loa,</HI> notwithstanding
that he had leave of the Spanish King
to trade in all parts of the West Indies,
and having the Plate Fleete in his
power, did not take out of it one ounce
of Silver, but kept his faith and pro|mise
in all places, was set upon by <HI>Don
Henrico de Martines</HI> whom he suffe|red
(to save him from perishing) to en|ter
the Porte; upon <HI>Martins</HI> faith, and
enterchanged pledges delivered, he had
<HI>Iesus</HI> of <HI>Lubeck</HI> a Ship of her Majesties
of a 1000 tun burnt; had his men slain
which hee left on the Land; lost his
Ordnance, and all the treasure which
<PB N="51" REF="27">
he had got by Trade; what reason had
I to goe unarmed upon the Ambassa|dours
promises, whose words and
thoughts that they were one, it hath wel
appeared since then, aswell by the for|ces
which he perswaded his Master to
send to <HI>Guiana</HI> to encounter me, and
cut me off there; as by his persecuting
of me since my returne; who have nei|ther
invaded his Masters Indies, nor
his Fleet, whereof he stood in doubt.</P>
<P>True it is, that the Spaniards can|not
endure that the English Nation
should looke upon any part of <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI>
being above a fourth part of the
whole knowne world; and the hun|dred
part neither possessed by the Spa|niards,
nor to them knowne, as <HI>Acosta</HI>
the Jesuit in his description of the
West Indies doth confesse, and well
know to be true: No though the King
of <HI>Spaine</HI> can pretend no other title to
all that he hath not conquered, then
the Popes donation; for from the
<PB N="52" REF="28">
straits of <HI>Megellan</HI> to the river of <HI>Plate,</HI>
being a greater territory then al that the
Spaniards possesse in <HI>Peru</HI> or <HI>Chile,</HI> and
from <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Augustines</HI> to <HI>Trinidado</HI>
being a greater ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">ent of Land then all
which he possesses in <HI>Nova Spaine,</HI> or
elsewhere, they have not one foote of
ground in their possession, neither for
the greatest part of it so much as in
their owne knowledge.</P>
<P>In <HI>Orrenoque</HI> they have lately set up
a Wooden Towne, and made a kind of
a Forte, but they have never been able
either to Conquer the Guianians;
nor to reconcile them, but the Guiani|ans
before their planting, they did wil|lingly
resigne all that territory to her
Majesty, who by me promised to re|ceive
them, and defend them against
the Spaniards; and though I were a
Prisoner for this last fourteene years,
yet I was at the charge every yeare, or
every second yeare, to send unto them
to keepe them in hope of being relie|ved.
<PB N="53" REF="28">
And as I have said before the grea|test
of the naturall Lords, did offer us
a rich Myne of Gold in his owne
Country in hope to hold us there;
And if this usurped possession of the
Spaniards be a sufficient bar to his Ma|jesties
right; and that thereby the King
of <HI>Spaine</HI> calls himselfe King of <HI>Guia|na,</HI>
why might he not aswell call him|selfe
Duke of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> because hee
tooke possession of <HI>Blewett,</HI> and built
a Forte there; and calls himselfe King
of <HI>Ireland;</HI> because he tooke possession
at <HI>Smerike</HI> and built a Forte there.</P>
<P>If the Ambassadour had protested
to his Majesty that my going to <HI>Guia|na</HI>
before I went would be a breach to
the peace, I am perswaded that his Ma|jesty
if he had not bin resolved that
<HI>Guiana</HI> had been his would have stayed
me, but if it be not thought to be a
breach of Peace not for the going thi|ther
(for that cannot be) because I had
no other intent, and went with leave;
<PB N="54" REF="29">
but for taking and burning of a Spa|nish
towne in the Country, certainly,
if the Country be the King of <HI>Spains,</HI>
it had been no lesse a breach of Peace
to have wrought any Myne of his, and
to have rob'd him of his Gold; then
it is now cald'd a breach of peace to
take a towne of his in <HI>Guiana</HI> and
burne it, and with as good reason
might I have bin called a thiefe and a
robber of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> if the
Country be not his Majesties, as I am
now pursued for the Invasion; for ei|ther
the Country is the King of <HI>Spains</HI>
or not the Kings; if it be the Kings, I
have not then offended; if it be not the
Kings, I must have perished, if I had
but taken Gold out of the Mynes there,
though I had found no Spaniards in
the Country.</P>
<P>For conclusion, if we had had any
peace with the Spaniards in those parts
of the world; why did even those Spa|niards,
which were now encountered
<PB N="55" REF="29">
in <HI>Guiana,</HI> tye six and thirty English
men out of Master <HI>Walls</HI> Ship of
<HI>London</HI> and mine back to back, and cut
their throats, after they had traded
with them a whole month, and came to
them a shore; having not so much as a
sword, or any other weapon, among
them all, and if the Spaniards to our
complaints made answer, that there
was nothing in the treate against our
trading in the Indies, but that we might
trade at our perill; I trust in God that
the word perill shall ever be constru|ed
to be indifferent to both Nations;
otherwise we must for ever abandon
the Indies, and loose all our know|ledge,
and our Pylotage of that part
of the world: if we have no other peace
then this; how can there be a breach
of peace, which e're the Spaniards
with all Nations, and all Nations
with them may trade upon their
guard?</P>
<P>The readiest way that the Spani|ards
<PB N="56" REF="30">
Ambassadour could have taken,
to have stayed me from going to
<HI>Guiana;</HI> had bin to have discovered the
great practises which I had with his
Master against the King my Sove|raigne
Lord in the first yeare of his
Majesties Reigne of Great <HI>Brittaine,</HI>
for which I lost my estate and lay thir|teene
years in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI>
and not to urge my offences in <HI>Guiana;</HI>
to which his Master hath no title o|ther
then his sword, is with which to
this day, he hath not conquered the
least of these Nations, and against
whom contrary to the Catholick pro|fession,
his Captains have entertained,
and doe entertaine whole Nations of
Canniballs; for in a Letter of the Go|vernours
to the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> of the
eighth of <HI>Iuly:</HI> he not only complai|neth
that the <HI>Guianians</HI> are in Armes
against him, but that ever those In|dians
which under their noses live, doe
in despight of all the Kings edicts
<PB N="57" REF="30">
trade with <HI>Los Flamnicos &amp; Engleses,
enemicos,</HI> With the Flemish, and Eng|lish
enemies, never once naming the
English Nations but with the Epi|theton
of an enemy.</P>
<P>But in truth the Spanish Ambassa|dour
hath complained against me to
no other end, then to prevent my com|plaints
against the Spaniards. Who
landing my men in a territory apper|taining
to the Crowne of <HI>England;</HI>
they were invaded and slaine before
any violence offered to the Spaniards;
and I hope that the Ambassadour doth
not esteeme us for so wretched and
miserable a people, as to offer our
throats to their swords without any
manner of resistance; howsoever, I
have said it already, and I will say it
againe; that if <HI>Guiana</HI> be not his Ma|jesties,
the working of a Myne there;
and the taking of a towne there; had
been equally perillous, for by doing
the one, I had rob'd the King of <HI>Spaine</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="31">
and bin a thiefe; and by the other a
disturber or breaker of the peace.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter of Sir WALTER
RAWLEIGH to my
Lord Carevv touching
Guiana.</HEAD>
<P>BEcause I know not whether I
shall live, to come before the
Lords, I have for his Majesties satis|faction
here set downe as much as I
can say, either for mine owne defence,
or against my selfe, as things are now
construed.</P>
<P>It is true, that though I acquainted
his Majesty with my intent to Land in
<HI>Guiana,</HI> yet I never made it knowne
to his Majesty that the Spaniards had
any footing there; neither had I any
authority by Patent, to remove them
from thence, and therefore his Majesty
had no interest in the attempt of Saint
<HI>Thome</HI> by any foreknowledge in his
Majesty.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="31">
But knowing his Majesties title to
the Country to be best, and most
Christian, because the naturall Lords
did most willingly acknowledge
Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to be their Sove|raigne,
who by me promised to defend
them from the Spanish cruelty, I made
no doubt but I might enter the Land
by force, seeing the Spaniards had no
other title but force, (the Popes dona|tion
excepted) considering also that
they had got a possession there divers
yeares since my possession for the
Crowne of <HI>England,</HI> for were not <HI>Guia|na</HI>
his Majesties, then might I aswell
have bin questioned for a thiefe, for ta|king
the Gold out of the King of
<HI>Spains</HI> Mynes, as the Spaniards doe
now call me a peace breaker; for, from
any territory that belongs to the King
of <HI>Spaine,</HI> it is no more lawfull to take
Gold, then lawfull for the Spaniards to
take Tinne out of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> were this
possession of theirs a sufficient Bar to
<PB N="60" REF="32">
his Majesties Right, the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
may as well call themselves Dukes of
<HI>Brittaine,</HI> because they held <HI>Blewet,</HI> and
fortified there; and Kings of <HI>Ireland</HI>
because they possessed <HI>Smereck</HI> and for|tified
there, and so in other places.</P>
<P>That his Majesty was well resolved
of his right there, I make no kind of
doubt, because the English both under
Master <HI>Charls Leigh</HI> and Master <HI>Hare|court</HI>
had leave to plant and inhabite
the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Orrenoque</HI> it selfe, had long ere
this had 5000. English in it, I assure
my selfe, had not my employment at
<HI>Cales,</HI> the next yeare after my returne
from <HI>Guiana,</HI> and after that our jour|ny
to the Islands hindered me, for those
two years after with <HI>Tirones</HI> Rebellion,
made her Majesty unwilling that any
great number of Ships or men should
be taken out of <HI>England,</HI> till that re|bellion
were ended, and lastly, her
Majesties death, my long imprison|ment
<PB N="61" REF="32">
gave time to the Spaniards
to set up a towne of sticks covered
with leaves of trees upon the banke of
<HI>Orronoque,</HI> which they call St. <HI>Thome,</HI>
but they have neither reconciled nor
Conquered any of the Cassiques or na|turall
Lords of the Country, which
Cassiques are still in armes against
them, as by the Governours Letter to
the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> may appeare:
That by landing in <HI>Guiana</HI> there can
be any breach of peace, I thinke it (un|der
favour) impossible, for to breake
peace where there is no peace, it can|not
be; that the Spaniards give us no
peace there, it doth appeare by the
Kings Letters to the Governour, that
they should put to death all those Spa|niards
and Indians that trade, <HI>Con los
Engleses Enemigos</HI> with English ene|mies:
yea those very Spaniards which
we encountred at St. <HI>Thome,</HI> did of late
years murther six and thirty of Master
<HI>Hales</HI> men of <HI>London,</HI> and mine, who
<PB N="62" REF="33">
landed without weapon, upon the Spa|niards
faith to trade with them, Ma|ster
<HI>Thorne</HI> also in <HI>Tower-street</HI> in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
besides many other English were
in like sort murthered in <HI>Orrenoque,</HI> the
yeare before my deliverie out of the
<HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>Now if this kind of trade be peace|able,
there is then a peaceable trade in
the Indies, betweene us and the Spa|niards,
but if this be cruell Warre and
hatred, and no peace, then there is no
peace broken by our attempt; Againe,
how doth it stand with the greatnesse
of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> first to call us e|nemies,
when he did hope to cut us in
pieces, and then having failed, to call
us peace breakers: for to be an enemy
and a peace breaker in one and the
same action is impossible.</P>
<P>But the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> in his Let|ters
to the Governour of <HI>Guiana,</HI> dated
at <HI>Madrill</HI> the 29 of <HI>March,</HI> before we
left the <HI>Thames,</HI> calls us <HI>Engleses ene|migos,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="33">
English enemies.</P>
<P>If it had pleased the King of <HI>Spaine</HI>
to have written to his Majest. in seaven
months time, for we were so long in
preparing, and have made his Majesty
know, that our landing in <HI>Guiana</HI>
would draw after it a breach of peace,
I presume to thinke, that his Majesty
would have staied our enterprise for the
present.</P>
<P>This he might have done with lesse
charge, then to leavy three hundred
souldiers and transport ten pieces of
Ordnance from <HI>Portarico,</HI> which soul|diers
added to the Garrison of St.
<HI>Thome:</HI> had they arrived before our
comming, had overthrowne all our
raw companies, and there would have
followed no complaints.</P>
<P>For the maine point of landing neer
St. <HI>Thome,</HI> it is true, that we were of
opinion, that we must have driven the
Spaniards out of the towne, before we
could passe the thick woods upon the
<PB N="64" REF="34">
mountaines of the Myne, which I con|fesse
I did first resolve upon, but bet|ter
bethinking my selfe, I reserved the
taking of the towne, to the goodnesse
of the Myne, which if they found to be
so rich, as it might perswade the lea|ving
of the Garrison, then to drive the
Spaniards thence, but to have burnt
was never my intent, neither could
they give me any reason why they did
it, upon their returne I examined the
Serjeant-Major and <HI>Keymis</HI> why they
followed not my last directions for the
triall of the Myne before the taking of
the towne, and they answered me, that
although they durst hardly, goe to the
Myne leaving a Garrison of Spaniards,
between them and their Boats, yet they
offended their latter directions, and did
Land, betweene the towne and the
Myne.</P>
<P>And that the Spaniards without any
manner of parley set upon them una|wares,
and charged them, calling them
<PB N="65" REF="34">
<HI>Perros Ingleses,</HI> &amp; by Skirmishing with
them, they drew them on to the very
entrance of the town before they knew
where they were, so that if any peace
had bin in those parts, the Spaniards
first brake the peace, and made the first
slaughter, for as the English could not
but Land to seeke the Myne, being
come thither to that end, so being first
reviled, and charged by the Spaniards,
they could doe no lesse then repell
force by force; lastly it is a matter of
no small consequence to acknowledge
that wee have offended the King of
<HI>Spaine</HI> by landing in <HI>Guiana.</HI></P>
<P>For first it weakens his Majesties ti|tle
to the Country or quits it; Second|ly,
there is no King that hath ever gi|ven
the least way to any other King or
State in the traffick of the lives or
goods of his Subjects, to wit in our
case, that it shall be lawfull for the
Spaniards tomurther us, either by force
or treason, and unlawfull for us to
<PB N="66" REF="35">
defend our selves and pay them with
their owne Coyne, for this superiority
and inferiority is a thing which no ab|solute
Monarch ever yeilded to, or ever
will.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it shews the English bears
greater respect to the Spaniard, and is
more doubtfull of his forces, then
either the French or Dutch is, who
daily invade all parts of the Indies
with not being questioned at their re|turne,
yea at my owne being at <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI>
a French Gentleman called <HI>Flo|ry</HI>
went thence with foure saile, and
three hundred Land men, with Com|mission
to land and burne, and to sack
all places in the Indies that he could
master, and yet the French King hath
married the daughter of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>This is all that I can say, other then
that I have spent my poore estate, lost
my sonne, and my health, and endu|red
as many sorts of miseries, as ever
man did, in hope to do his Majesty ac|ceptable
<PB N="67" REF="35">
service; And have not to my
understanding committed any hostile
act, other then entrance upon a terri|tory
belonging rightly to the Crowne
of <HI>England,</HI> where the English were
first set upon and slaine by the usur|ping
Spaniards, I invaded no other parts
of the Indies, pretended by the Spani|ards.</P>
<P>I returned into <HI>England</HI> with mani|fest
perill of my life, with a purpose
not to hold my life, with any other
then his Majesties grace, and from
which no man, nor any perill could
disswade me; To that grace, and good|nesse,
and Kinglynesse I referre my self,
which if it shall find that I have not

to adde more affliction to the re|mainder
