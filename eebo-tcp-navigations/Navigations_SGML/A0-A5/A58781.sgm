<P><HI>Having at</HI> London <HI>in the year</HI> 1679, <HI>the opportunity of frequent conver&s;e with &s;everal
<PB N="2" REF="5"> Sub&s;tantial and Judicious Gentlemen, concerned in the</HI> American Plantations, <HI>I had thereby the opportunity of under&s;tanding throughly the great advantage redounding to that City, from</HI> Undertakings of this nature, <HI>and rational grounds of Conjecture,</HI> That their Com|merce with that place of the World, hath been one of the greate&s;t Improve|ments of that Trade, they have for ma|ny years enjoyed, which hath rendered it now one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ci|ties in <HI>Europe;</HI> the Cu&s;tomes thereof which in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, were farmed at <HI>Fifty thou&s;and pounds,</HI> paying now in to the Exchequer, near <HI>&s;even hun|dred thou&s;and pounds</HI> yearly, which great Improvement may be much attribute to their Trade with <HI>America,</HI> brought now in a great manner to Perfection, which at that time was but in its Infancy.</P>
<P><HI>From that time I began to have &s;trong in|clinations, to be more fully informed in that Affair, and to be at all imaginable pains, to notice the &s;ame verie concernedly&punc; and for my more full &s;atisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ction, I judged i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> requi&s;it to trace the verie beginnings of all the</HI> Engli&s;h Plantations, <HI>and their gradual progre&s;&s;es ere they arrived at that perfection they pre&s;ently

<P><HI>To this apparently difficult que&s;tion I find a very &s;atisfying an&s;wer given verie fullie by the Learned</HI> Hales, <HI>his A&s;&s;ertion, to wit,</HI> That notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e apparent difficulties, a Migrati|on unto <HI>America</HI> from the De&s;cendants of <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> was not onely po&s;&s;ible, but probable, that the &s;amine was &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive, that tho the time or manner of the&s;e Migrations cannot certainly be de|fined, yet many of them were long &s;ince, &s;ome thou&s;and of years; Yet after the univer&s;al Deluge, that the means of this Tran&s;migration of the De&s;cendents of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> unto <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> hath been both by Sea and Land.

There are many places upon Na|vigable Rivers yet untaken, and &s;ome very near this place al&s;o, which is intended to be the <HI>Metrapolis</HI> of this Province; But it is generally &s;andy barren land, and the be&s;t
<PB N="242" REF="126"> land is compute by all to be in the woods, back &s;ome &s;everal miles from the Navigable Rivers; So that we rather chu&s;e land for profitablne&s;s, then for Conveniences of Towns, and plea&s;ure allennarly.

If I de&s;ign to come home, which we can do at good profite. Now for a general de&s;cription of this Countrey, it is a fine place for tho&s;e who have a good &s;tock, to lay out upon a &s;tock of Cattel of all &s;orts, which do greatly multiply here in a &s;hort time, and are &s;old at great rates, and may &s;oon increa&s;e a &s;tock greatly; or it is a good Countrey for an Indu&s;trious Frugal Man, that de&s;ignes to fol|low Husbandries clo&s;lie; providing he bring but &s;ome little &s;tock to &s;tock a Plantation with|all; or it is very good for Trad&s;men, as good Carpenters, Smiths, Tailors, &amp;c. who will get large wages a day. But it is not a Coun|trey for idle &s;luggi&s;h People; or tho&s;e who cannot &s;ome times put too their hands, and en|courage their Servants. It is a place that pro|duces many fine Fruits, and Phy&s;ick Herbs; The Woods are &s;tored with wild Deers, Conies, Woulves, Boars, Racouns, &s;ome Bavers, and &s;everal other Bea&s;ts, which have fine Furrs. There is al&s;o abundance of Fowls, and Fi&s;h, and Water Fowl for the killing. The Timber
<PB N="244" REF="127"> are mo&s;tly Oak of all &s;orts, Walnut, Che&s;nut, whereof there are great abundance where I have planted, tho they be&s;carce &s;o bigg as the&s;e that comes to <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet large as plea&s;ant. Strawberries grow very thick upon the ground among&s;t the Trees; &s;o that &s;ome places of the Woods are in Summer as it were covered with a red cloath. As I am certainly informed, Fruit Trees advance at a great rate in this place, for a Man may have an Orchard within a few years after the Planting, that may yeeld him a great quantitie of Cydar, which is the chief|e&s;t of their drink in this Province, even among&s;t the meane&s;t of the Planters; So that this Countrey if well improved, may make a fine place; for Nature has been defficient in nothing to it, either for plea&s;ure or fruitfulne&s;s of the Soyl; So that a man being once &s;ettled two or three years in it, and having Corn, Cattle, and all things nece&s;&s;ary for the u&s;e of man within him&s;elf.

<P>YOur Brother and I did write to you about three Moneths agoe, wherein we told you, that we were 9. weeks at &s;ea, after we parted from <HI>Killebegs</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> we were all very well; at Sea only we had more Stomachs then meat, to prevent which, if you or any other Commorad come this way, it will be prudence to fortifie them&s;elves with good Chee&s;e, Butter, Bisket, Caks, and Brandie; I believe you are cloyed with de&s;criptions of the Countrey; And therefore this in brief, the reports you hear of it are generally true, &s;ome it may be are <HI>Hyperbolick</HI> in magnifying its Goodne&s;s, but as many are detractive from what it really de&s;erves; There is abundance of good Land for the impro|ving; Abundance of Swine and Cattle for the rai&s;ing, Deers for killing, hou&s;es for the building: But &s;ome expect all

Your brother and I and our Servants have had good Veni|&s;on broth once a day, all this winter; to be &s;hort, if a man plea&s;e to live a Countrey Life to labour Land, plant Or|chards, and &s;uch like; I believe he cannot come to a place that will better an&s;wer his expectations, and when he hath a minde to be merry he will get a Pun&s;h-hou&s;e, and very good fellows. I hope in a little time I &s;hall want nothing but the company of the prettie Girls, to all whom, who retain any remem|brance of me, Let my &s;ervice be re|membered, &amp; to all friends; I long exceed|ingly to hear from you, but more to &s;ee you; we had many difficulties as our entrance, and in our fir&s;t indea|vours; But when you come, I hope they &s;hall be prevented by,</P>
