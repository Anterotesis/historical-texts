<P>IT is now Seven and Twenty Years, &s;ince the Moon appeared fir&s;t Hi&s;torically on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Horizon: And let it not &s;eem &s;trange, that &s;he &s;hould have retained Light and Brightne&s;s &s;o long here, without Re|vovation; when we find by Experience, that in the Heavens, &s;he never fails once a Month to change and &s;hift her Splendor. For it is the Excellency of Art, to repre&s;ent Nature, even in her ab&s;ence; and this being a Piece done to the Life, by one that had the advan|tage of the true Light, as well as the Skill of Drawing, in this kind, to Perfection; he left &s;o good an Original, which was &s;o well Copied by another Hand, that the Picture
<PB REF="3"> might have &s;erved for many Years more, to have given the Lovers of the Moon, a &s;ight of their Mistre&s;s, even in the darke&s;t Nights; and when &s;he was retired to put on a clean Smock in <HI>Phoebus</HI> his Apartment; if they had been &s;o curious, as to have encou|raged the Expo&s;ers.</P>
<P>However, Reader, you have now a &s;econd View of her, and that under the &s;ame Cover with the Sun too, which is very rare; &s;ince the&s;e two were never &s;een before in Conjunction. Yet I would have none be afraid, that their Eyes being dazled with the glorious Light of the Sun, they &s;hould not &s;ee her; for Fancy will &s;upply the Weak|ne&s;s of the Organ, and Imagination, by the help of this Mirrour, will not fail to di&s;cover them both; though <HI>Cynthia</HI> lye hid under <HI>Apollo</HI>'s &s;hining Mantle. And &s;o much for the Luminaries.</P>
<P>Now as to the <HI>Worlds,</HI> which, with Ana|logy to ours below, I may call the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New;</HI> that of the Moon having been di&s;co|vered, tho imperfectly, by others, but the Sun owing its Di&s;covery wholly to our Au|thor: I make no doubt, but the Ingenious Reader will find in both, &s;o extraordinary and &s;urprizing Rarities, as well Natural, Moral, as Civil; that if he be not as yet &s;ufficiently di&s;gusted with this lower World,
<PB REF="3"> (which I am &s;ure &s;ome are) to think of making a Voyage thither, as our Author has done; he will at lea&s;t be plea&s;ed with his Relations. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ince this Age produces a great many bold Wits, that &s;hoot even beyond the Moon, and cannot endure, (no more than our Author) to be &s;tinted by Magi&s;terial Au|thority, and to believe nothing but what Gray-headed Antiquity gives them leave: It's pity &s;ome &s;oaring
<HI>Virtuo&s;o,</HI> in&s;tead of Travelling into <HI>France,</HI> does not take a flight up to the Sun; and by new Ob&s;ervations &s;up|ply the defects of its Hi&s;tory; occa&s;ioned not by the Negligence of our Witty <HI>French</HI> Au|thor, but by the accur&s;ed Plagiary of &s;ome rude Hand, that in his Sickne&s;s, rifled his Trunks, and stole his Papers, as he him&s;elf complains.</P>
<P>Let &s;ome venturous &V;ndertaker au&s;pici|ou&s;ly attempt it then; and if neither of the two &V;niver&s;ities, <HI>Gre&s;ham</HI>-Colledge, nor <HI>Greenwich</HI>-Ob&s;ervatory can furni&s;h him with an In&s;trument of Conveyance; let him try his own Invention, or make u&s;e of our Author's Machine: For our Lo&s;s is, indeed, &s;o great, that one would think, none but the declared E|nemy of Mankind, would have had the Ma|lice, to purloyn and &s;tiffle tho&s;e rare Di&s;cove|ries, which our Author made in the Province of the Solar Philo&s;ophers; and which un|doubtedly
<PB REF="4"> would have gone far, as to the &s;et|tleing our Sublunary Philo&s;ophy, which, as well as Religion, is lamentably rent by Sects and Whim&s;eys; and have convinced us, perhaps, that in our pre&s;ent Doubts and Per|plexities, a little more, or a little le&s;s of ei|ther, would better &s;erve our Turns, and more content our Minds.</P>

<HEAD>THE Comical HISTORY OF THE STATE AND EMPIRE OF THE WORLD OF THE MOON.</HEAD>
<P>I Had been with &s;ome Friends at <HI>Cla|mard,</HI> a Hou&s;e near <HI>Paris,</HI> and mag|nificently Entertain'd there by <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Guigy,</HI> the Lord of it; when upon
<PB N="2" REF="6"> our return home, about Nine of the Clock at Night, the Air &s;erene, and the Moon in the Full, the Contemplation of that bright Luminary, furni&s;hed us with &s;uch variety of Thoughts, as made the way &s;eem &s;horter than, indeed, it was. Our Eyes being fixed upon that &s;tately Planet, every one &s;poke what he thought of it: One would needs have it be a Garret Window of Heaven; another pre&s;ently affirmed, That it was the Pan whereupon <HI>Diana</HI> &s;mooth|ed <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Bands; whil&s;t another was of Opinion, That it might very well be the Sun him&s;elf, who putting his Locks up under his Cap at Night, peeped through a hole, to ob&s;erve what was doing in the World, during his ab&s;ence: And for my part, Gentlemen, &s;aid I, that I may put in for a &s;hare, and gue&s;s with the re&s;t; not to amu&s;e my &s;elf with tho&s;e curious Notions, wherewith you tickle and &s;pur on &s;low|paced Time; I believe, that the Moon is a World like ours, to which this of ours &s;erves likewi&s;e for a Moon. This was re|ceived with the general Laughter of the Company. And perhaps, &s;aid I, (Gen|tlemen) ju&s;t &s;o they laugh now in the Moon, at &s;ome who maintain, That this Globe, where we are, is a World. But I'd as good have &s;aid nothing, as have alledg|ed to them, That a great many Learned
<PB N="3" REF="6"> Men had been of the &s;ame Opinion; for that only made them laugh the fa&s;ter. However, this thought, which becau&s;e of its boldne&s;s &s;uted my Humor, being con|firmed by Contradiction, &s;unk &s;o deep in|to my mind, that during the re&s;t of the way, I was big with Definitions of the Moon, which I could not be delivered of: In&s;omuch that by &s;triving to verifie this Comical Fancy, by Rea&s;ons of appearing weight, I had almo&s;t per&s;waded my &s;elf already of the truth on't; when a Mira|cle, Accident, Providence, Fortune, or what, perhaps, &s;ome may call Vi&s;ion, o|thers Fiction, Whim&s;ey, or (if you will) Folly, furni&s;hed me with an occa&s;ion, that engaged me into this Di&s;cour&s;e. Being come home, I went up into my Clo&s;et, where I found a Book open upon the Ta|ble, which I had not put there. It was a piece of <HI>Cardanus;</HI> and though I had no de&s;ign to read in it, yet I fell at fir&s;t &s;ight, as by force, exactly upon a Pa&s;&s;age of that Philo&s;opher, where he tells us, That Study|ing one evening by Candle-light, he per|ceived Two tall old Men, enter in through the door that was &s;hut, who after many que|&s;tions that he put to them, made him an|&s;wer, That they were Inhabitants of the Moon, and thereupon immediately di&s;ap|peared. I was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, not only to &s;ee
<PB N="4" REF="7"> a Book get thither of it &s;elf; but al&s;o be|cau&s;e of the nicking of the Time &s;o patly, and of the Page, at which it lay open, that I looked upon that Concatenation of Acci|dents, as a Revelation, di&s;covering to Mortals, that the Moon is a World. How! &s;aid I to my &s;elf, having ju&s;t now talked of a thing, can a Book, which, perhaps, is the only Book in the World, that treats of that matter &s;o particularly, fly down from the Shelf upon my Table, become capable of Rea&s;on, in opening &s;o exactly at the place of &s;o &s;trange an adventure; force my Eyes in a manner to look upon it, and then to &s;ugge&s;t to my fancy the Reflexions, and to my Will the De&s;igns which I hatch: Without doubt, continued I, the Two old Men, who appeared to that famous Philo&s;o|pher, are the very &s;ame who have taken down my Book, and opened it at that Page, to &s;ave them&s;elves the labour of making to me the Harangue, which they made to <HI>Cardan.</HI> But, added I, I cannot be re|&s;olved of this Doubt, unle&s;s I mount up thither: And why not? &s;aid I in&s;tantly to my &s;elf. <HI>Promethus</HI> heretofore went up to Heaven, and &s;tole fire from thence. Have not I as much Boldne&s;s as he? And why &s;hould not I, then, expect as favou|rable a Succe&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"> After the&s;e &s;udden &s;tarts of Imagination, which may be termed, perhaps, the Rav|ings of a violent Feaver, I began to conceive &s;ome hopes of &s;ucceeding in &s;o fair a Voy|age: In&s;omuch that to take my mea&s;ures aright, I &s;hut my &s;elf up in a &s;olitary Coun|try-hou&s;e; where having flattered my fancy with &s;ome means, proportionated to my de|&s;ign, at length I &s;et out for Heaven in this manner.</P>
<P>I planted my &s;elf in the middle of a great many Gla&s;&s;es full of Dew, tied fa&s;t about me; upon which the Sun &s;o violently dart|ed his Rays, that the Heat which attracted them, as it does the thicke&s;t Clouds, car|ried me up &s;o high, that at length I found my &s;elf above the middle Region of the Air. But &s;eeing that Attraction hurried me up with &s;o much rapidity, that in&s;tead of drawing near the Moon, as I intended, &s;he &s;eem'd to me to be more di&s;tant, than at my fir&s;t &s;etting out; I broke &s;everal of my Vials, until I found my weight exceed the force of the Attraction, and that I began to de&s;cend again towards the Earth. I was not mi&s;taken in my opinion, for &s;ome time after I fell to the ground again; and to reckon from the hour that I &s;et out at, it mu&s;t then have been about midnight. Ne|verthele&s;s I found the Sun to be in the Meridian, and that it was Noon. I leave
<PB N="6" REF="8"> it to you to judge, in what Amazement I was: The truth is, I was &s;o &s;trangely &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that not knowing what to think of that Miracle, I had the in&s;olence to imagine, that in favour of my Boldne&s;s, God had once more nailed the Sun to the Firmament, to light &s;o generous an Enter|pri&s;e. That which encrea&s;ed my A&s;toni&s;h|ment was, That I knew not the Country where I was; it &s;eemed to me, that ha|ving mounted &s;traight up, I &s;hould have fallen down again in the &s;ame place I parted from. However, in the Equipage I was in, I directed my cour&s;e towards a kind of Cottage, where I perceived &s;ome &s;moke; and I was not above a Pi&s;tol|&s;hot from it, when I &s;aw my &s;elf envi|roned by a great number of People, &s;tark naked: They &s;eemed to be exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of me; for I was the fir&s;t, (as I think) that they had ever &s;een clad in Bottles. Nay, and to baffle all the Interpretations, that they could put upon that Equipage, they per|ceived, that I hardly touched the ground as I walked; for, indeed, they under|&s;tood not, that upon the lea&s;t agitation I gave my Body, the Heat of the beams of the Noon-Sun, rai&s;ed me up with my Dew; and that if I had had Vials enough about me, it would po&s;&s;ibly have carried me up
<PB N="7" REF="8"> into the Air in their view. I had a mind to have &s;poken to them; but as if Fear had changed them into Birds, immediately I lo&s;t &s;ight of them, in an adjoyning Fore&s;t. How|ever, I catched hold of one, who&s;e Legs had, without doubt, betrayed his Heart. I asked him, but with a great deal of pain, (for I was quite choked) how far they reckoned from thence to
<HI>Paris?</HI> How long Men had gone naked in <HI>France?</HI> and why they fled from me in &s;o great Con&s;ternati|on? The Man I &s;poke to was an old taw|ny Fellow, who pre&s;ently fell at my Feet, and with lifted-up Hands, joyned behind his Head, opened his Mouth and &s;hut his Eyes: He mumbled a long while be|tween his Teeth, but I could not di&s;tin|gui&s;h an articulate Word; &s;o that I took his Language for the maffling noi&s;e of a Dumb-man.</P>
<P>Some time after, I &s;aw a Company of Souldiers marching, with Drums beating; and I perceived Two detached from the re&s;t, to come and take &s;peech of me. When they were come within hearing, I asked them, Where I was? You are in <HI>France,</HI> an&s;wered they: But what Devil hath put you into that Dre&s;s? And how comes it that we know you not? Is the Fleet then arrived? Are you going to car|ry the News of it to the Governor?
<PB N="8" REF="9"> And why have you divided your Brandy into &s;o many Bottles? To all this I made an&s;wer, That the Devil had not put me into that Dre&s;s: That they knew me not; becau&s;e they could not know all Men: That I knew nothing of the <HI>Seine's</HI> car|rying Ships to <HI>Paris:</HI> That I had no news for the <HI>Mar&s;hal de l' Ho&s;pital;</HI> and that I was not loaded with Brandy. Ho, ho, &s;aid they to me, taking me by the Arm, you are a merry Fellow indeed; come, the Governor will make a &s;hift to know you, no doubt on't. They led me to their Company, where I learnt that I was in reality in <HI>France,</HI> but that it was in <HI>New-France:</HI> So that &s;ome time after, I was pre&s;ented before the Governor, who asked me my Country, my Name and Qua|lity; and after that I had &s;atisfied him in all Points, and told him the plea&s;ant Suc|ce&s;s of my Voyage, whether he believed it, or only pretended to do &s;o, he had the goodne&s;s to order me a Chamber in his Apartment. I was very happy, in meeting with a Man capable of lofty Opinions, and who was not at all &s;urpri&s;ed, when I told him, that the Earth mu&s;t needs have turned during my Elevation; &s;eeing that having begun to mount about Two Leagues from
<HI>Paris,</HI> I was fallen, as it were, by a per|pendicular Line in
<HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"> When I was going to Bed at night, he came into my Chamber, and &s;poke to me to this purpo&s;e: I &s;hould not have come to di&s;turb your Re&s;t, had I not thought that one who hath found out the &s;ecret, of Travelling &s;o far in Twelve hours &s;pace, had likewi&s;e a charm again&s;t La&s;&s;itude. But you know not, added he, what a plea&s;ant Quarrel I have ju&s;t now had with our Fathers, upon your account? They'll have you ab&s;olutely to be a Magician; and the greate&s;t favour you can expect from them, is to be reckoned only an Impo&s;tor: The truth is, that Motion which you attri|bute to the Earth, is a pretty nice Paradox; and for my part I'll frankly tell you, That that which hinders me from being of your Opinion, is, That though you parted ye&s;ter|day from <HI>Paris,</HI> yet you might have arrived to day in this Country, without the Earth's turning: For the Sun having drawn you up, by the means of your Bottles, ought he not to have brought you hither; &s;ince ac|cording to <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and the Modern Phi|lo&s;ophers, he marches obliquely, as you make the Earth to move? And be&s;ides, what great Probability have you to ima|gine, that the Sun is immoveable, when we &s;ee it go? And what appearance is there, that the Earth turns with &s;o great Rapidity, when we feel it firm under our Feet? Sir,
<PB N="10" REF="10"> replied I to him, The&s;e are, in a manner, the Rea&s;ons that oblige us to think &s;o: In the fir&s;t place, it is con&s;onant to common Sen&s;e, to think that the Sun is placed in the Center of the Univer&s;e; &s;eeing all Bodies in nature, &s;tanding in need of that radical Heat, it is fit he &s;hould re&s;ide in the heart of the Kingdom, that he may be in a condi|tion, readily to &s;upply the Nece&s;&s;ities of eve|ry Part; and that the Cau&s;e of Generations, &s;hould be placed in the middle of all Bodies, that it may act there with greater Equality and Ea&s;e: After the &s;ame manner, as Wi&s;e Nature hath placed the Genitals in Man, the Seeds in the Center of Apples, the Kernels in the middle of their Fruits; and in the &s;ame manner, as the Onion, under the cover of &s;o many Coats that encompa&s;s it, pre&s;erves that precious Bud, from which Millions of others are to have their being, for an Apple is in it &s;elf a little Univer&s;e; the Seed, hotter than the other parts thereof, is its Sun, which diffu&s;es about it &s;elf that natural Heat, which pre&s;erves its Globe: And in the Onion, the Germ is the little Sun of that little World, which vivifies and nouri&s;hes the vegetative Salt of that little ma&s;s. Having laid down this, then, for a ground, I &s;ay, That the Earth &s;tanding in need of the Light, Heat, and Influence of this great Fire, it turns round it, that it
<PB N="11" REF="10"> may receive in all parts alike, that Virtue which keeps it in Being. For it would be as ridiculous to think, that that va&s;t lumi|nous Body, turned about a point, that it has not the lea&s;t need of; as to imagine, that when we &s;ee a roa&s;ted Lark, that the Kitchin|fire mu&s;t have turned round it. El&s;e, were it the part of the Sun to do that drudgery, it would &s;eem that the Phy&s;ician &s;tood in need of the Patient; that the Strong &s;hould yield to the Weak; the Superior &s;erve the Inferior; and that the Ship did not &s;ail a|bout the Land, but the Land about the Ship. Now if you cannot ea&s;ily conceive, how &s;o ponderous a Body can move; Pray, tell me, are the Stars and Heavens, which, in your Opinion, are &s;o &s;olid, any way lighter? Be&s;ides, it is not &s;o difficult for us, who are a&s;&s;ured of the Roundne&s;s of the Earth, to infer its motion from its Figure: But why do ye &s;uppo&s;e the Heaven to be round, &s;eeing you cannot know it, and that yet, if it hath not this Figure, it is im|po&s;&s;ible it can move? I object not to you your
<HI>Excentricks</HI> nor <HI>Epicycles,</HI> which you cannot explain but very confu&s;edly, and which are out of doors in my Sy&s;teme. Let's reflect only on the natural Cau&s;es of that Motion. To make good your Hy|pothe&s;is, you are forced to have recour&s;e to Spirits or <HI>Intelligences,</HI> that move and go|vern
<PB N="12" REF="11"> your Spheres. But for my part, with|out di&s;turbing the repo&s;e of the &s;upreme Being, who, without doubt, hath made Nature entirely perfect, and who&s;e Wi&s;dom ought &s;o to have compleated her, that be|ing perfect in one thing, &s;he &s;hould not have been defective in another: I &s;ay, that the Beams and Influences of the Sun, darting Circularly upon the Earth, make it to turn, as with a turn of the Hand, we make a Globe to move; or, which is much the &s;ame, that the Steams which continu|ally evaporate from that &s;ide of it, which the Sun &s;hines upon, being reverbera|ted by the Cold of the middle Region, rebound upon it, and &s;triking obliquely, do of nece&s;&s;ity make it whirle about in that manner.</P>
<P>The Explication of the other Motions is le&s;s perplexed &s;till; for pray, con&s;ider a lit|tle&mdash; At the&s;e words the Vice-Roy inter|rupted me: I had rather, &s;aid he, you would excu&s;e your &s;elf from that trouble; for I have read &s;ome Books of <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI> on that &s;ubject: And hear what one of our Fathers, who maintained your Opinion one day, an&s;wered me. Really, &s;aid he, I fancy that the Earth does move, not for the Rea&s;ons alledged by <HI>Copernicus;</HI> but becau&s;e Hell-fire, being &s;hut up in the Cen|ter of the Earth, the damned who make a
<PB N="13" REF="11"> great bu&s;tle to avoid its Flames, &s;cramble up to the Vault, as far as they can from them, and &s;o make the Earth to turn, as a Turn|&s;pit makes the Wheel go round, when he runs about in it.</P>
<P>We applauded that Thought, as being a pure effect of the Zeal of that good Fa|ther: And then the Vice-Roy told me, That he much wondered, how the Sy&s;teme of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> being &s;o improbable, &s;hould have been &s;o univer&s;ally received. Sir, &s;aid I to him, mo&s;t part of Men, who judge of all things by the Sen&s;es, have &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be per&s;waded by their Eyes; and as he who Sails along a Shoar, thinks the Ship immoveable, and the Land in motion; even &s;o Men turning with the Earth round the Sun, have thought that it was the Sun that moved about them. To this may be added, the un&s;upportable Pride of Mankind, who per&s;wade them&s;elves, that Nature hath only been made for them; as if it were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ikely that the Sun, a va&s;t Body, Four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">undred and thirty four times bigger than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Earth, had only been kindled to ripen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Medlars, and plumpen their Cabbage. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">or my part, I am &s;o far from complying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ith their In&s;olence, that I believe the Pla|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ets are Worlds about the Sun, and that
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e fixed Stars are al&s;o Suns, which have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">anets about them, that's to &s;ay, Worlds,
<PB N="14" REF="12"> which becau&s;e of their &s;mallne&s;s, and that their borrowed light cannot reach us, are not di&s;cernable by Men in this World: For in good earne&s;t, how can it be imagined, that &s;uch &s;pacious Globes are no more but va&s;t De&s;arts; and that ours, becau&s;e we live in it, hath been framed for the habita|tion of a dozen of proud Dandyprats? How, mu&s;t it be &s;aid, becau&s;e the Sun mea&s;ures our Days and Years, that it hath only been made, to keep us from running our Heads again&s;t the Walls? No, no, if that vi&s;ible Deity &s;hine upon Man, it's by accident, as the King's Flamboy by acci|dent lightens a Porter that walks along the Street: But, &s;aid he to me, if, as you affirm, the fixed Stars be &s;o many Suns, it will follow, that the World is infinite; &s;eeing it is probable, that the People of that World, which moves about that fixed Star, you take for a Sun, di&s;cover above them|&s;elves other fixed Stars, which we cannot perceive from hence, and &s;o others in that manner <HI>in infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>Never que&s;tion, replied I, but as God could create the Soul Immortal, He could al&s;o make the World Infinite; if &s;o it be that Eternity is nothing el&s;e, but an illimi|ted Duration, and an <HI>infinite,</HI> a boundle&s;s Exten&s;ion: And then God him&s;elf would be Finite, &s;uppo&s;ing the World not to be
<PB N="15" REF="12"> infinite, &s;eeing he cannot be where nothing is, and that he could not encrea&s;e the greatne&s;s of the World, without adding &s;omewhat to his own Being, by beginning to exi&s;t, where he did not exi&s;t before. We mu&s;t believe then, that as from hence we &s;ee <HI>Saturn</HI> and
<HI>Jupiter;</HI> if we were in ei|ther of the Two, we &s;hould di&s;cover a great many Worlds which we perceive not, and that the Univer&s;e extends &s;o
<HI>in infi|nitum.</HI></P>
<P>I' faith, replied he, when you have &s;aid all you can, I cannot at all compre|hend that Infinitude. Good now, replied I to him, do you comprehend the Nothing that is beyond it? Not at all. For when you think of that <HI>Nothing,</HI> you imagine it at lea&s;t to be like Wind or Air, and that is a Being: But if you conceive not an <HI>Infinite</HI> in general, you comprehend it at lea&s;t in particulars; &s;eeing it is not difficult to fancy to our &s;elves beyond the Earth, Air, and Fire which we &s;ee, other Air, and other Earth, and other Fire. Now Infinitude is nothing el&s;e, but a boundle&s;s Series of all the&s;e. But if you ask me, How the&s;e Worlds have been made, &s;eeing Holy Scrip|ture &s;peaks only of one that God made? My an&s;wer is, That I have no more to &s;ay: For to oblige me to give a Rea&s;on for every thing, that comes into my Imagination, is
<PB N="16" REF="13"> to &s;top my Mouth, and make me confe&s;s, that in things of that nature, my Rea&s;on &s;hall always &s;toop to Faith. He ingeni|ou&s;ly acknowledged to me, that his Que&s;ti|on was to be cen&s;ured, but bid me pur&s;ue my notion: So that I went on, and told him, That all the other Worlds, which are not &s;een, or but imperfectly believed, are no more, but the Scum that purges out of the Suns. For how could the&s;e great Fires &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome matter, that &s;erved them for Fewel? Now as the Fire drives from it the A&s;hes that would &s;tifle it, or the Gold in a Crucible, &s;eparates from the Marca&s;ite and Dro&s;s, and is refined to the highe&s;t Standard; nay, and as our Stomack di&s;charges it &s;elf by vomit, of the Crudi|ties that oppre&s;s it; even &s;o the&s;e Suns dai|ly evacuate, and reject the Remains of mat|ter, that might incommode their Fire: But when they have wholly con&s;umed that matter, which entertains them; you are not to doubt, but they &s;pread them&s;elves abroad on all &s;ides, to &s;eek for fre&s;h Fewel, and fa&s;ten upon the Worlds, which here|tofore they have made, and particularly upon tho&s;e that are neare&s;t: Then the&s;e great Fires, reconcocting all the Bodies, will as formerly force them out again,
<HI>Pell|mell</HI> from all parts; and being by little and little purified, they'll begin to &s;erve for
<PB N="17" REF="13"> Suns, to other little Worlds, which they procreate by driving them out of their Spheres: And that without doubt, made the
<HI>Pythagoreans</HI> foretel the univer&s;al Con|flagration.</P>
<P>This is no ridiculous Imagination, for <HI>New-France</HI> where we are, gives us a very convincing in&s;tance of it. The va&s;t Con|tinent of <HI>America,</HI> is one half of the Earth, which in &s;pight of our Predece&s;&s;ors, who a Thou&s;and times had crui&s;ed the Ocean, was not at that time di&s;covered: Nor, in|deed, was it then in being, no more than a great many I&s;lands, Penin&s;ules, and Moun|tains that have &s;ince &s;tarted up in our Globe; when the Sun purged out its Excrements to a convenient di&s;tance, and &s;ufficient Gravity, to be attracted by the Center of our World, either in &s;mall Particles, per|haps, or, it may be al&s;o, altogether in one lump. That is not &s;o unrea&s;onable, but that St. <HI>Austin</HI> would have applauded to it, if that Country had been di&s;covered in his Age. Seeing that great Man, who had a very clear Wit, a&s;&s;ures us, That in his time, the Earth was flat like the floor of an Oven, and that it floated upon the Water, like the half of an Orange: But if ever I have the honour to &s;ee you in <HI>France,</HI> I'll make you ob&s;erve, by means of a mo&s;t excellent Cele&s;cope, that &s;ome Ob&s;curities,
<PB N="18" REF="14"> which from hence appear to be Spots, are Worlds a forming.</P>
<P>My Eyes that &s;hut with this Di&s;cour&s;e, obliged the Vice-Roy to withdraw. Next Day, and the Days following, we had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: But &s;ome time after, &s;ince the hurry of Affairs &s;u&s;pended our Philo&s;ophy, I fell afre&s;h upon the de&s;ign of mounting up to the Moon.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as &s;he was up, I walked about mu&s;ing in the Woods, how I might ma|nage and &s;ucceed in my Enterpri&s;e; and at length on St. <HI>John</HI>'s-Eve, when they were at Council in the Fort, whether they &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the Wild Natives of the Country a|again&s;t the
<HI>Iroqueans;</HI> I went all alone to the top of a little Hill, at the back of our Habitation, where I put in Practice what you &s;hall hear. I had made a Machine, which I fancied might carry me up as high as I plea&s;ed, &s;o that nothing &s;eeming to be want|ing to it, I placed my &s;elf within, and from the Top of a Rock, threw my &s;elf in the Air: But becau&s;e I had not taken my mea|&s;ures aright, I fell with a &s;o&s;h in the Valley below. Brui&s;ed as I was, however, I re|turned to my Chamber, without loo&s;ing courage, and with Beef-Marrow I anoint|ed my Body, for I was all over mortified from Head to Foot: Then having taken a
<PB N="19" REF="14"> dram of Cordial Waters to &s;trengthen my Heart, I went back to look for my Ma|chine; but I could not find it, for &s;ome Sol|diers, that had been &s;ent into the Fore&s;t, to cut wood for a Bonefire, meeting with it by chance, had carried it with them to the Fort: Where after a great deal of gue&s;&s;ing what it might be, when they had di&s;co|vered the invention of the Spring, &s;ome &s;aid, that a good many Fire-Works &s;hould be fa&s;tened to it, becau&s;e their Force carry|ing them up on high, and the Machine play|ing its large Wings, no Body but would take it for a Fiery Dragon. In the mean time I was long in &s;earch of it, but found it at length in the middle of the Market|place of <HI>Kebeck,</HI> ju&s;t as they were &s;etting Fire to it. I was &s;o tran&s;ported with Grief, to find the Work of my Hands in &s;o great Peril, that I ran to the Souldier, that was gi|ving Fire to it, caught hold of his Arm, pluckt the Match out of his Hand, and in great rage threw my &s;elf into my Ma|chine, that I might undo the Fire-Works, that they had &s;tuck about it; but I came too late, for hardly were both my Feet with|in, when whip, away went I up in a Cloud: The Horror and Con&s;ternation I was in, did not &s;o confound the faculties of my Soul, but I have &s;ince remembred all that happened to me at that in&s;tant. For &s;o &s;oon
<PB N="20" REF="15"> as the Flame had devoured one tire of Squibs, which were ranked by &s;ix and &s;ix, by means of a Train, that reached every half-dozen; another tire went off, and then another; &s;o that the Salt-Peter taking Fire, put off the danger by encrea&s;ing it. However, all the combu&s;tible matter being &s;pent, there was a period put to the Fire|work; and whil&s;t I thought of nothing le&s;s, than to knock my Head again&s;t the top of &s;ome Mountain, I felt, without the lea&s;t &s;tirring, my elevation continuing; and adieu Machine, for I &s;aw it fall down again towards the Earth. That extraor|dinary Adventure puffed up my Heart with &s;o uncommon a Gladne&s;s; that, ravi&s;h|ed to &s;ee my &s;elf delivered from certain danger, I had the impudence to philo&s;o|phize upon it. Whil&s;t then with Eyes and Thought I ca&s;t about, to find what might be the cau&s;e of it, I perceived my fle&s;h blown up, and &s;till grea&s;y with the Marrow, that I had daubed my &s;elf over with, for the Brui&s;es of my fall: I knew that the Moon being then in the Wain, and that it being u&s;ual for her in that Quarter, to &s;uck up the Marrow of Animals; &s;he drank up that wherewith I was anointed, with &s;o much the more force, that her Globe was nearer to me, and that no inter|po&s;ition of Clouds weakened her Attraction.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="15"> When I had, according to the computa|tion I made &s;ince, advanced a good deal more, than three quarters of the &s;pace, that divided the Earth from the Moon; all of a &s;udden I fell with my Heels up, and Head down, though I had made no Trip; and indeed, I had not been &s;en&s;ible of it, had not I felt my Head loaded under the weight of my Body: The truth is, I knew very well, that I was not falling again to|wards our World; for though I found my &s;elf to be betwixt two Moons, and ea&s;ily ob&s;erved, that the nearer I drew to the one, the farther I removed from the other; yet I was certain, that ours was the big|ger Globe of the two: Becau&s;e after one or two days Journey, the remote Refracti|ons of the Sun, confounding the diver&s;ity of Bodies and Climates, it appeared to me only as a large Plate of Gold: That made me imagine, that I bya&s;&s;ed towards the Moon; and I was confirmed in that Opinion, when I began to call to mind, that I did not fall, till I was pa&s;t three quarters of the way. For, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, that Ma&s;s being le&s;s than ours, the Sphere of its Activity mu&s;t be of le&s;s Ex|tent al&s;o; and by con&s;equence, it was la|ter before I felt the force of its Center.</P>
<P>In fine, after I had been a very long while in falling, as I judged, for the vi|olence
<PB N="22" REF="16"> of my Precipitation hindered me from ob&s;erving it more exactly: The la&s;t thing I can remember is, That I found my &s;elf under a Tree, entangled with three or four pretty large Branches, which I had broken off by my fall; and my Face be|&s;meared with an Apple, that had da&s;hed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>By good luck that place was, as you &s;hall know by and by &mdash; So that you may very well conclude, that had it not been for that Chance, if I had had a thou&s;and lives, they had been all lo&s;t. I have many times &s;ince reflected upon the vulgar Opinion, That if one precipitate him&s;elf from a very high place, his breath is out before he reach the ground; and from my adventure I conclude it to be fal&s;e, or el&s;e that the efficacious Juyce of that Fruit, which &s;quirted into my mouth, mu&s;t needs have recalled my Soul, that was not far from my Carca&s;s, which was &s;till hot, and in a di&s;po&s;ition of exerting the Functions of Life. The truth is, &s;o foon as I was upon the ground, my pain was gone, before I could think what it was; and the Hunger, which I felt during my Voyage, was fully &s;atisfied with the &s;en&s;e that I had lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>When I was got up, I had hardly ta|ken notice of the large&s;t of Four great
<PB N="23" REF="16"> Rivers, which by their conflux make a Lake; when the Spirit, or invi&s;ible Soul of Plants, that breath upon that Country, refre&s;hed my Brain with a delightful &s;mell: And I found that the Stones there, were neither hard nor rough; but that they carefully &s;oftened them&s;elves, when one trode upon them. I pre&s;ently lighted upon a Walk with five Avenues, in figure like to a Star; the Trees whereof &s;eemed to reach up to the Skie, a green plot of lofty Boughs: Ca&s;ting up my Eyes from the root to the top, and then making the &s;ame Survey downwards, I was in doubt whe|ther the Earth carried them, or they the Earth, hanging by their Roots: Their high and &s;tately Forehead &s;eemed al&s;o to bend, as it were by force, under the weight of the Cele&s;tial Globes; and one would &s;ay, that their Sighs and out-&s;tretch|ed Arms, wherewith they embraced the Firmament, demanded of the Stars the bounty of their purer Influences, before they had lo&s;t any thing of their Innocence, in the contagious Bed of the Elements. The Flowers there on all hands, without the aid of any other Gardiner but Na|ture, &s;end out &s;o &s;weet (though wild) a Perfume, that it rouzes and delights the Smell: There the incarnate of a Ro&s;e upon the Bu&s;h, and the lively Azure of a
<PB N="24" REF="17"> Violet under the Ru&s;hes, captivating the Choice, make each of them&s;elves to be judged the Faire&s;t: There the whole Year is a Spring; there no poy&s;onous Plant &s;prouts forth, but is as &s;oon de&s;troyed; there the Brooks by an agreeable murmur|ing, relate their Travels to the Pebbles; there Thou&s;ands of Quiri&s;ters make the Woods, re&s;ound with their melodious Notes; and the quavering Clubs of the&s;e divine Mu|&s;icians are &s;o univer&s;al, that every Leaf of the Fore&s;t, &s;eems to have borrowed the Tongue and &s;hape of a Nightingale; nay, and the Nymph <HI>Eccho</HI> is &s;o delightful with their Airs, that to hear her repeat, one would &s;ay, She were &s;ollicitous to learn them. On the &s;ides of that Wood, are Two Meadows, who&s;e continued Verdure &s;eems an Emerauld, reaching out of &s;ight. The various Colours, which the Spring be|&s;tows upon the numerous little Flowers that grow there, &s;o delightfully confounds and mingles their Shadows; that it is hard to be known, whether the&s;e Flowers &s;haken with a gentle Breeze, pur&s;ue them&s;elves, or fly rather from the Care&s;&s;es of the Wan|ton
<HI>Zephyrus;</HI> one would likewi&s;e take that Meadow for an Ocean, becau&s;e as the Sea, it pre&s;ents no Shoar to the view; in&s;o|much, that mine Eye fearing it might lo&s;e it &s;elf, having roamed &s;o long, and
<PB N="25" REF="17"> di&s;covered no Coa&s;t, &s;ent my Thoughts pre|&s;ently thither; and my Thoughts, imagin|ing it to be the end of the World, were willing to be per&s;waded, that &s;uch charm|ing places, had, perhaps, forced the Hea|vens to de&s;cend, and join the Earth there. In the mid&s;t of that va&s;t and plea&s;ant Car|pet, a ru&s;tick Fountain bubbles up in Sil|ver Purles, crowning its enamelled Banks with Sets of Violets, and multitudes of o|ther little Flowers, that &s;eem to &s;trive, which &s;hall fir&s;t behold it &s;elf in that Chry|&s;tal Myrroir: It is as yet in the Cradle, being but newly Born, and its Young and &s;mooth Face &s;hews not the lea&s;t Wrinkle. The large Compa&s;&s;es it fetches, in circling within it &s;elf, demon&s;trate its unwilling|ne&s;s to leave its native Soyl: And as if it had been a&s;hamed to be care&s;&s;ed in pre|&s;ence of its Mother, with a Murmuring it thru&s;t back my hand, that would have touched it: The Bea&s;ts that came to drink there, more rational than tho&s;e of our World, &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it day upon the Horizon, whil&s;t the Sun was with the <HI>Antipodes;</HI> and dur&s;t not bend downwards upon the Brink, for fear of falling into the Firmament.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, That at the &s;ight of &s;o many Fine things, I found my &s;elf tickled with the&s;e agreeable Twitches,
<PB N="26" REF="18"> which, they &s;ay, the <HI>Embryo</HI> feels upon the infu&s;ion of its Soul: My old Hair fell off, and gave place for thicker and &s;ofter Locks: I perceived my Youth revived, my Face grow ruddy, my natural Heat mingle gently again, with my radical Moi&s;ture: And in a word, I grew younger again, by at lea&s;t Fourteen Years.</P>
<P>I had advanced half a League, through a a Fore&s;t of Je&s;&s;amines and Myrtles, when I perceived &s;omething that &s;tirred, lying in the Shade: It was a Youth, who&s;e Maje|&s;tick Beauty forced me almo&s;t to Adorati|on. He &s;tarted up to hinder me; crying, It is not to me, but to God that you owe the&s;e Humilities. You &s;ee one, an&s;wered I, &s;tunned with &s;o many Wonders, that I knew not what to admire mo&s;t; for com|ing from a World, which without doubt you take for a Moon here, I thought I had ar|rived in another, which our Worldlings call a Moon al&s;o; and behold I am in Pa|radice at the Feet of a God, who will not be Adored. Except the quality of a God, replied he, who&s;e Creature I only am, the re&s;t you &s;ay is true: This Land is the Moon, which you &s;ee from your Globe, and this place where you are is &mdash; Now at that time Man's Imagination was &s;o &s;trong, as not being as yet corrupted, neither by Debauches, the Crudity of Ali|ments,
<PB N="27" REF="18"> nor the alterations of Di&s;ea&s;es, that being excited by a violent de&s;ire of coming to this Sanctuary, and his Body becoming light, through the heat of this In&s;piration; he was carried thither in the &s;ame manner, as &s;ome Philo&s;ophers, who having fixed their Imagination, upon the contemplation of a certain Object, have &s;prung up in the Air by Ravi&s;hments, which you call Exta|&s;ies. The Woman, who through the in|firmity of her Sex, was weaker and le&s;s hot, could not, without doubt, have the Imagination &s;trong enough, to make the Inten&s;ion of her Will, prevail over the Pon|derou&s;ne&s;s of her Matter; but becau&s;e there were very few &mdash;</P>
<P>The Sympathy which &s;till united that half to its whole, drew her towards him as he mounted up, as the Amber attracts the Straw; the Load-&s;tone turns to|wards the North, from whence it hath been taken, and drew to him that part of him|&s;elf, as the Sea draws the Rivers which proceed from it. When they arrived in your Earth, they dwelt betwixt <HI>Me&s;opota|mia</HI> and <HI>Arabia:</HI> Some People knew them by the name of &mdash;, and others under that of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> whom the Poets feign|ed to have &s;tolen Fire from Heaven, by rea&s;on of his Off-&s;pring, who were endowed with a Soul as perfect as his own: So that
<PB N="28" REF="19"> to inhabit your World, that Man left this de&s;titute; but the All-wi&s;e, would not have &s;o ble&s;&s;ed an Habitation, to remain without Inhabitants: He &s;uffered a few ages after that &mdash; cloyed with the company of Men, who&s;e Innocence was corrupted, had a de&s;ire to for&s;ake them. This per&s;on, however, thought no retreat &s;ecure enough from the Ambition of Men, who already Murdered one another, about the di&s;tributi|on of your World; except that ble&s;&s;ed Land, which his Grand-Father had &s;o often men|tioned unto him, and to which no Body had as yet found out the way: But his Imagination &s;upplied that; for &s;eeing he had ob&s;erved that &mdash; he filled Two large Ve&s;&s;els which he &s;ealed Hermetically, and fa&s;tened them under his Arm-pits: So &s;oon as the Smoak began to ri&s;e upwards, and could not pierce through the Mettal, it for|ced up the Ve&s;&s;els on high, and with them al&s;o that Great Man. When he was got as high as the Moon, and had ca&s;t his Eyes upon that lovely Garden, a fit of al|mo&s;t &s;upernatural Joy convinced him, that that was the place, where his Grand|father had heretofore lived. He quickly untied the Ve&s;&s;els, which he had girt like Wings about his Shoulders, and did it &s;o luckily, that he was &s;carcely Four Fathom in the Air above the Moon, when he &s;et
<PB N="29" REF="19"> his Fins a going; yet het was high enough &s;till, to have been hurt by the fall, had it not been for the large skirts of his Gown, which being &s;welled by the Wind, gently upheld him, till he &s;et Foot on ground. As for the two Ve&s;&s;els, they mounted up to a certain place, where they have conti|nued: And tho&s;e are they, which now a|days you call the
<HI>Balance.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t now tell you, the manner how I came hither: I believe you have not for|got my name, &s;eeing it is not long &s;ince I told it you. You &s;hall know then, that I lived on the agreeable Banks of one of the mo&s;t renowned Rivers of your World; where among&s;t my Books, I lead a Life plea&s;ant enough, not to be lamented, though it &s;lipt away fa&s;t enough. In the mean while, the more I encrea&s;ed in Knowledge, the more I knew my Ignorance. Our Learned Men never put me in mind of the famous <HI>Mada,</HI> but the thoughts of his perfect Philo&s;ophy made me to Sigh. I was de&s;pairing of be|ing able to attain to it, when one day, af|ter a long and profound Studying, I took a piece of Load-&s;tone about two Foot &s;quare, which I put into a Furnace; and then after it was well purged, precipita|ted and di&s;&s;olved, I drew the calcined At|tractive of it, and reduced it into the &s;ize of about an ordinary Bowl.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="20"> After the&s;e Preparations, I got a very light Machine of Iron made, into which I went &mdash; and when I was well &s;eated in my place, I threw this Magnetick Bowl, as high as I could, up into the Air. Now the Iron Machine, which I had purpo&s;ely made more ma&s;&s;ive in the middle than at the ends, was pre&s;ently elevated, and in a ju&s;t Poi&s;e; becau&s;e the middle received the greate&s;t force of Attraction. So then, as I arrived at the place, whither my Load|&s;tone had attracted me, I pre&s;ently threw up my Bowl in the Air over me. But, &s;aid I, interrupting him, How came you to heave up your Bowl &s;o &s;treight over your Chariot, that it never happened to be on one &s;ide of it? That &s;eems to me to be no wonder at all, &s;aid he; for the Load|&s;tone being once thrown up in the Air, drew the Iron &s;treight towards it; and &s;o it was impo&s;&s;ible, that ever I &s;hould mount &s;ide-ways. Nay more, I can tell you, that when I held the Bowl in my hand, I was &s;till mounting upwards; becau&s;e the Cha|riot flew always to the Load-&s;tone, which I held over it. But the effort of the Iron, to be united to my Bowl, was &s;o violent, that it made my Body bend double; &s;o that I dur&s;t but once e&s;&s;ay that new Ex|periment. The truth is, it was a very &s;urprizing Spectacle to behold; for the
<PB N="31" REF="20"> Steel of that flying Hou&s;e, which I had very carefully Poli&s;hed, reflected on all &s;ides the light of the Sun, with &s;o great life and lu&s;tre, that I thought my &s;elf to be all on fire. In fine, after often Bowl|ing and following of my Ca&s;t, I came, as you did, to an Elevation, from which I de&s;cended towards this World; and be|cau&s;e at that in&s;tant, I held my Bowl ve|ry fa&s;t between my hands, my Machine, whereof the Seat pre&s;&s;ed me hard, that it might approach its Atractive, did not for|&s;ake me; all that now I feared was, that I &s;hould break my Neck: But to &s;ave me from that, ever now and then, I to&s;&s;ed up my Bowl; that by its atractive Virtue, it might prevent the violent De|&s;cent of my Machine, and render my fall more ea&s;ie, as indeed it happened; for when I &s;aw my &s;elf, within Two or three hundred fathom of the Earth, I threw out my Bowl on all hands, level with the Chariot, &s;ometimes on this &s;ide, and &s;ometimes on that, until I came to a cer|tain Di&s;tance; and immediately then, I to&s;&s;ed it up above me; &s;o that my Ma|chine following it, I left it, and let my &s;elf &s;all on the other &s;ide, as gently as I could, upon the Sand; in&s;omuch that my fall was no greater, than if it had been but my own height. I &s;hall not de&s;cribe to
<PB N="32" REF="21"> you the amazement I was in at the &s;ight of the wonders of this place, &s;eeing it was &s;o like the &s;ame, wherewith I ju&s;t now &s;aw you &s;eized&mdash;</P>
<P>Scarcely had I ta&s;ted it, when a thick Cloud over-ca&s;t my Soul: I &s;aw no body now near me; and in the whole Hemi|&s;phere, my Eyes could not di&s;cern the lea&s;t Tract of the way I had made; yet, never|thele&s;s I fully remembred every thing that befel me. When I reflected &s;ince upon that Miracle, I fanced that the skin of the Fruit which I bit, had not rendered me altogether bruti&s;h; becau&s;e my Teeth piercing through it were, a little moi&s;ten|ed by the Juyce within, the efficacy where|of had di&s;&s;ipated the Malignities of the Rind. I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee my &s;elf all alone, in a Country I knew not. It was to no purpo&s;e for me, to &s;tare and look about me; for no Creature ap|peared to comfort me: At length, I re&s;olved to march forwards, till Fortune &s;hould aford me the company of &s;ome Bea&s;ts, or at lea&s;t the means of Dying.</P>
<P>She favourably granted my de&s;ire; for within half a quarter of a League, I met two huge Animals, one of which &s;topt before me, and the other fled &s;wiftly to its Den; for &s;o I thought at lea&s;t; becau&s;e that &s;ome time after, I perceived it come back again,
<PB N="33" REF="21"> in company of above Seven or Eight hun|dred of the &s;ame kind, who be&s;et me. When I could di&s;cern them at a near di|&s;tance, I perceived that they were propor|tioned and &s;haped like us. This adven|ture brought into my mind, the old Wives Tales of my Nur&s;e concerning <HI>Syrenes, Faunes</HI> and <HI>Satyrs:</HI> Ever now and then they rai&s;ed &s;uch furious Shouts, occa&s;ioned undoubtedly by their Admiration, at the &s;ight of me, that I thought I was e'en turned a Mon&s;ter. At length one of the&s;e Bea&s;t-like men, catching hold of me by the Neck, ju&s;t as Wolves do when they carry away Sheep, to&s;&s;ed me upon his back, and brought me into their Town; where I was more amazed than before, when I knew they were Men, that I could meet with none of them, but who marched upon all four.</P>
<P>When the&s;e People &s;aw that I was &s;o little, (for mo&s;t of them are Twelve Cubits long,) and that I walked only upon Two Legs, they could not believe me to be a Man: For they were of opinion, that Nature having given to men as well as Bea&s;ts Two Legs and Two Arms, they &s;hould both make u&s;e of them alike. And, indeed, reflecting upon that &s;ince, that &s;cituation of Body did not &s;eem to me altogether extravagant; when I called to mind, that whil&s;t Children are
<PB N="34" REF="22"> &s;till under the nurture of Nature, they go upon all four, and that they ri&s;e not on their two Legs, but by the care of their Nur&s;es; who &s;et them in little running Chairs, and fa&s;ten &s;traps to them, to hin|der them from falling on all four, as the only po&s;ture that the &s;hape of our Body naturally inclines to re&s;t in.</P>
<P>They &s;aid then, (as I had it interpre|ted to me &s;ince) That I was infallibly the Female of the Queens little Animal. And therefore as &s;uch, or &s;omewhat el&s;e, I was carried &s;treight to the Town-Hou&s;e, where I ob&s;erved by the muttering and ge&s;tures, both of the People and Magi&s;trates, that they were con&s;ulting what &s;ort of a thing I could be. When they had con|ferred together a long while, a certain Burgher, who had the keeping of the &s;trange Bea&s;ts, be&s;ought the Mayor and Aldermen to commit me to his Cu&s;tody, till the Queen &s;hould &s;end for me to couple me to my Male. This was granted with|out any difficulty, and that Juggler carried me to his Hou&s;e; where he taught me to Tumble, Vault, make Mouths, and &s;hew a Hundred odd Tricks, for which in the Afternoons he received Money at the door, from tho&s;e that came in to &s;ee me: But Heaven pitying my Sorrows, and vext to &s;ee the Temple of its Maker profaned, &s;o
<PB N="35" REF="22"> ordered it, that one day as I was tied to a Rope, wherewith the Mountebank made me Leap and Skip to divert the People; I heard a Man's voice, who asked me what I was, in Greek. I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear one &s;peak in that Country, as they do in our World. He put &s;ome Que&s;tions to me, which I an&s;wered, and then gave him a full account of my whole de&s;ign, and the &s;ucce&s;s of my Travels: He took the pains to comfort me, and, as I take it, &s;aid to me: Well, Son, at length you &s;uffer for the frailties of your World: There is a Mobile here, as well as there, that can away with nothing, but what they are accu&s;to|med to: But know, that you are but ju&s;tly &s;erved; for had any one of this Earth, had the boldne&s;s to mount up to yours, and call him&s;elf a Man, your Sages would have de&s;troyed him as a Mon&s;ter. He then told me, That he would acquaint the Court with my di&s;a&s;ter; adding, that &s;o &s;oon as he had heard the news that went of me, he came to &s;ee me, and was &s;atisfied that I was a man of the World, of which I &s;aid I was; becau&s;e he had Travelled there formerly, and &s;ojourned in <HI>Greece,</HI> where he was called the <HI>Demon</HI> of
<HI>Socrates:</HI> That after the Death of that Philo&s;opher, he had governed and taught <HI>Epaminondas</HI> at <HI>Thebes:</HI> After which being gone over to the <HI>Romans,</HI> Ju&s;tice
<PB N="36" REF="23"> had obliged him to e&s;pou&s;e the party of the Younger
<HI>Cato:</HI> That after his Death, he had addicted him&s;elf to
<HI>Brutus:</HI> That all the&s;e great Men, having left in that World no more, but the &s;hadow of their Virtues, he with his Companions, had retreated to Temples and Solitudes. In a word, ad|ded he, the People of your World became &s;o dull and &s;tupid, that my Companions and I lo&s;t all the Plea&s;ure, that formerly we had had in in&s;tructing them: Not but that you have heard Men talk of us; for they called us <HI>Oracles, Nymphs, Geniu&s;es, Fairies, Hou&s;hold-Gods, Lemmes, Larves, Lamiers, Hobgoblins, Nayades, Incubu&s;&s;es, Shades, Manes, Vi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Apparitions:</HI> We aban|doned your World, in the Reign of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus,</HI> not long after I had appeared to
<HI>Dru&s;us</HI> the Son of <HI>Livia,</HI> who waged War in <HI>Germany,</HI> whom I forbid to proceed any farther. It is not long &s;ince I came from thence a &s;econd time; within the&s;e Hundred Years I had a Commi&s;&s;ion to Tra|vel thither: I roamed a great deal in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and conver&s;ed with &s;ome, whom po&s;|&s;ibly you may have known. One Day, among&s;t others, I appeared to <HI>Cardan,</HI> as he was at his Study; I taught him a great many things, and he in acknowledg|ment promi&s;ed me, to inform Po&s;teri|ty, of whom he had tho&s;e Wonders,
<PB N="37" REF="23"> which he intended to leave in writing. There I &s;aw
<HI>Agrippa,</HI> the Abbot <HI>Trithemi|us,</HI> Doctor <HI>Fau&s;tus, La Bro&s;&s;e, Cae&s;ar,</HI> and a certain Cabal of Young Men, who are commonly called <HI>Ro&s;acrucians</HI> or <HI>Knights of the Red-Cro&s;s,</HI> whom I taught a great many Knacks and Secrets of Nature, which, with|out doubt, have made them pa&s;s for great Magicians: I knew <HI>Campanella</HI> al&s;o; it was I that advi&s;ed him, whil&s;t he was in the In|qui&s;ition at <HI>Rome,</HI> to put his Face and Body into the u&s;ual Po&s;tures of tho&s;e, who&s;e in|&s;ide he needed to know, that by the &s;ame frame of Body, he might excite in him&s;elf, the thoughts which the &s;ame &s;cituation had rai&s;ed in his Adver&s;aries; becau&s;e by &s;o do|ing, he might better manage their Soul, when he came to know it; and at my de|&s;ire he began a Book, which we Entitu|led, <HI>De Sen&s;u Rerum.</HI> I likewi&s;e haunted in <HI>France, La Mothe le Vayer</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;&s;en|dus;</HI> this la&s;t hath written as much like a Philo&s;opher, as the other lived: I have known a great many more there, whom your Age call <HI>Divines,</HI> but all that I could find in them, was a great deal of Babble, and a great deal of Pride. In fine, &s;ince I pa&s;t over from your Country into <HI>En|gland,</HI> to acquaint my &s;elf, with the man|ners of its Inhabitants, I met with a Man, the &s;hame of his Country; for certainly it
<PB N="38" REF="24"> is a great &s;hame for the Grandees of your States, to know the virtue which in him has its Throne, and not to adore him: That I may give you an Abridgement of his Panegyrick, he is all Wit, all Heart, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the Qualities, of which one alone was heretofore &s;ufficient to make an Heroe: It was <HI>Tri&s;tan</HI> the Hermite. The Truth is, I mu&s;t tell you, when I per|ceived &s;o exalted a Virtue, I mi&s;tru&s;ted it would not be taken notice of, and there|fore I endeavoured to make him accept Three Vials, the fir&s;t filled with the Oyl of Talk, the other with the Powder of Projection, and the third with <HI>Aurum Po|tabile;</HI> but he refu&s;ed them with a more generous Di&s;dain, than <HI>Diogenes</HI> did the Complements of <HI>Alexander.</HI> In fine, I can add nothing to the Elogy of that Great Man, but that he is the only Poet, the only Philo&s;opher, and the only Free-man among&s;t you: The&s;e are the con&s;iderable Per&s;ons that I conver&s;ed with; all the re&s;t, at lea&s;t, that I know, are &s;o far be|low Men, that I have &s;een Bea&s;ts &s;ome|what above them.</P>
<P>After all, I am not a Native neither of this Country nor yours, I was born in the Sun; but becau&s;e &s;ometimes our World is over-&s;tock'd with people, by rea&s;on of the long Lives of the Inhabitants, and that
<PB N="39" REF="24"> there is hardly any Wars, or Di&s;ea&s;es a|mong&s;t them: Our Magi&s;trates, from time to time, &s;end Colonies into the neigbouring Worlds. For my own part, I was com|manded to go to yours; being declared Chief of the Colony that accompanyed me. I came &s;ince into this World, for the Rea|&s;ons I told you; and that which makes me continue here, is, becau&s;e the Men are great lovers of Truth, have no Pedants among them; that the Philo&s;ophers are never per&s;waded but by Rea&s;on, and that the Authority of a Doctor, or of a great number, is not preferred before the Opi|nion of a Thre&s;her in a Barn, when he has right on his &s;ide. In &s;hort, none are reckoned Mad-men in this Country, but Sophi&s;ters and Orators. I asked him how they lived? he made an&s;wer, three or four thou&s;and Years; and thus went on:</P>
<P>Though the Inhabitants of the Sun, be not &s;o numerous as tho&s;e of this World; yet the Sun is many times over &s;tocked, be|cau&s;e the People being of a hot con&s;titu|tion, are &s;tirring and ambitious, and dige&s;t much.</P>
<P>You ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at what I tell you; for though our Globe be very va&s;t, and yours little, though we die not before the end of Four thou&s;and Years, and you at the end of Fifty; yet know, that as there
<PB N="40" REF="25"> are not &s;o many Stones as clods of Earth, nor &s;o many Animals as Plants, nor &s;o ma|ny Men as Bea&s;ts; ju&s;t &s;o there ought not to be &s;o many Spirits as Men, by rea&s;on of the difficulties that occur in the Generation of a perfect Creature.</P>
<P>I asked him, if they were Bodies as we are? He made an&s;wer, That they were Bodies, but not like us, nor any thing el&s;e which we judged &s;uch; becau&s;e we call nothing a Body commonly, but what we can touch: That, in &s;hort, there was nothing in Nature, but what was material; and that though they them&s;elves were &s;o, yet they were forced, when they had a mind to appear to us, to take Bo|dies proportionated to what our Sen&s;es are able to know; and that, without doubt, that was the rea&s;on, why many have taken the Stories that are told of them, for the Delu&s;ions of a weak Fancy, becau&s;e they only appeared in the night time: He told me withal, That &s;eeing they were nece&s;&s;itated to piece together the Bodies, they were to make u&s;e of in great ha&s;te, many times they had not lei&s;ure enough, to render them the Objects of more Sen&s;es than one at a time, &s;ometimes of the Hear|ing, as the Voices of <HI>Oracles,</HI> &s;ometimes of the Sight,, as the
<HI>Fires</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;ions,</HI> &s;ome|times of the Feeling, as the
<HI>Incubu&s;&s;es;</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="25"> and that the&s;e Bodies being but Air con|den&s;ed, in &s;uch or &s;uch a manner, the Light di&s;per&s;ed them by its heat, in the &s;ame manner, as it &s;catters a Mi&s;t.</P>
<P>So many fine things as he told me, gave me the curio&s;ity to que&s;tion him about his Birth and Death; if in the Country of the Sun, the
<HI>individual</HI> was procreated by the ways of Generation, and if it died by the di&s;&s;olution of its Con&s;titution, or the di&s;|compo&s;ure of its Organs? Your &s;en&s;es, re|plied he, bear but too little proportion to the Explication of the&s;e My&s;teries: Ye Gentlemen imagine, that what&s;oever you cannot comprehend is &s;piritual, or that it is not at all; but that Con&s;equence is ab|&s;urd, and it is an argument, that there are a Million of things, perhaps, in the Univer&s;e, that would require a Million of different Organs in you, to under&s;tand them. For in&s;tance, I by my Sen&s;es know the cau&s;e of the Sympathy, that is betwixt the Load|&s;tone and the Pole, of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, and what becomes of the Animal after Death; you cannot reach the&s;e high Conceptions but by Faith, be|cau&s;e they are Secrets above the power of your Intellects; no more than a Blind-man can judge of the beauties of a Land-skip, the Colours of a Picture, or the &s;treaks of a Rain-bow; or at be&s;t he will fancy them
<PB N="42" REF="26"> to be&s;omewhat palpable, to be like Eating, a Sound, or a plea&s;ant Smell: Even &s;o, &s;hould I attempt to explain to you, what I perceive by the Sen&s;es which you want, you would repre&s;ent it to your &s;elf, as &s;ome|what that may be Heard, Seen, Felt, Smelt or Ta&s;ted, and yet it is no &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>He was gone on &s;o far in his Di&s;cour&s;e, when my Juggler perceived, that the Com|pany began to be weary of my Gibberi&s;h, that they under&s;tood not, and which they took to be an inarticulated Grunting: He therefore fell to pulling my Rope afre&s;h, to make me leap and skip, till the Specta|tors having had their Belly-fulls of Laugh|ing, affirmed that I had almo&s;t as much Wit, as the Bea&s;ts of their Country, and &s;o broke up.</P>
<P>Thus, all the comfort I had during the mi&s;ery of my hard U&s;age, were the vi&s;its of this officious Spirit; for you may judge what conver&s;ation I could have, with the&s;e that came to &s;ee me, &s;ince be&s;ides that they only took me for an Animal, in the highe&s;t cla&s;s of the
<HI>Category</HI> of Bruits, I neither under&s;tood their Language, nor they mine. For you mu&s;t know, that there are but two Idioms in u&s;e in that Country, one for the Grandees, and another for the People in general.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="26"> That of the great ones is no more, but various inarticulate Tones, much like to our Mu&s;ick, when the Words are not added to the Air: and in reality it is an Invention, both very u&s;eful and plea&s;ant; for when they are weary of talking, or di&s;|dain to pro&s;titute their Throats to that Of|fice, they take either a Lute, or &s;ome other In&s;trument, whereby they communicate their Thoughts, as well as by their Tongue: So that &s;ometimes Fifteen or Twenty in a Company, will handle a point of Divinity, or di&s;cu&s;s the difficulties of a Law-&s;uit, in the mo&s;t harmonious Con&s;ort, that ever tickled the Ear.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, which is u&s;ed by the Vulgar, is performed by a &s;hivering of the Mem|bers, but not, perhaps, as you may ima|gine, for &s;ome parts of the Body &s;ig|nifie an entire Di&s;cour&s;e; for example, the agitation of a Finger, a Hand, an Ear, a Lip, an Arm, an Eye, a Cheek, every one &s;everally will make up an Oration, or a Period with all the parts of it: Others &s;erve only in&s;tead of Words, as the knit|ting of the Brows, the &s;everal quiverings of the Mu&s;cles, the turning of the Hands, the &s;tamping of the Feet, the contor&s;ion of the Arm; &s;o that when they &s;peak, as their Cu&s;tom is, &s;tark naked, their Mem|bers being u&s;ed to ge&s;ticulate their Concep|tions,
<PB N="44" REF="27"> move &s;o quick, that one would not think it to be a Man that &s;poke, but a Body that trembled.</P>
<P>Every day almo&s;t the Spirit came to &s;ee me, and his rare Conver&s;ation made me patiently bear with the rigour of my Cap|tivity. At length, one morning I &s;aw a Man enter my Cabbin, whom I knew not, who having a long while licked me gently, took me up in his Teeth by the Shoulder, and with one of his Paws, wherewith he held me up, for fear I might hurt my &s;elf, threw me upon his Back; where I found my &s;elf &s;o &s;oftly &s;eated, and &s;o much at my ea&s;e, that being afflicted to be u&s;ed like a Bea&s;t, I had not the lea&s;t de&s;ire of making my e&s;cape; and be&s;ides, the&s;e Men that go upon all four, are much &s;wifter than we, &s;eeing the heavie&s;t of them, make nothing of running down a Stagg.</P>
<P>In the mean time I was extreamly troubled, that I had no news of my cour|teous Spirit; and the fir&s;t night we came to our Inn, as I was walking in the Court, expecting till Supper &s;hould be ready, a pretty hand&s;ome young Man came &s;mil|ing in my Face, and ca&s;t his Two Fore-Legs about my Neck. After I had a little con&s;idered him: How! &s;aid he in
<HI>French,</HI> do not you know your Friend then? I leave you to judge in what
<PB N="45" REF="181"> ca&s;e I was at that time; really, my &s;ur|pri&s;e was &s;o great, that I began to imagine, that all the Globe of the Moon, all that had befallen me, and all that I had &s;een, had on|ly been Enchantment: And that Bea&s;t-man, who was the &s;ame that had carried me all day, continued to &s;peak to me in this manner; You promi&s;ed me, that the good Offices I did you, &s;hould never be forgot|ten, and yet it &s;eems you have never &s;een me before; but perceiving me &s;till in amaze: In fine, &s;aid he, I am that &s;ame <HI>Demon</HI> of <HI>Socrates,</HI> who diverted you during your Impri&s;onment, and who, that I may &s;till oblige you, took to my &s;elf a Body, on which I carried you to day: But, &s;aid I interrupting him, how can that be, &s;ee|ing that all Day you were of a very long Stature, and now you are very &s;hort; that all day long you had a weak and broken Voice, and now you have a clear and vigorous one; that, in &s;hort, all day long you were a Grey-headed old Man, and are now a bri&s;k young Blade: Is it then that whereas in my Country, the Progre&s;s is from Life to Death; Animals here go Retrograde from Death to Life, and by growing old become young a|gain.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as I had &s;poken to the Prince, &s;aid he, and received orders to bring you
<PB N="49" REF="182"> to Court, I went and found you out where you were, and have brought you hither; but the Body I acted in, was &s;o tired out with the Journey, that all its Organs re|fu&s;ed me their ordinary Functions, &s;o that I enquired the way to the Ho&s;pital; where being come in I found the Body of a young Man, ju&s;t then expired by a very odd Accident, but yet very common in this Country &mdash; I drew near him, pre|tending to find motion in him &s;till, and prote&s;ting to tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, that he was not dead, and that what they thought to be the cau&s;e of his Death, was no more but a bare Lethargy; &s;o that without being perceived, I put my Mouth to his, by which I entred as with a breath: Then down dropt my old Carca&s;s, and as if I had been that young Man, I ro&s;e and came to look for you, leaving the Spectators crying a Miracle. With this they came to call us to Supper, and I followed my Guide into a Parlour rich|ly furni&s;hed; but where I found nothing fit to be eaten. No Victuals appearing, when I was ready to die of Hunger, made me ask him where the Cloath was laid: But I could not hear what he an|&s;wered, for at that in&s;tant Three or Four young Boys, Children of the Hou&s;e, drew near, and with much Civility &s;tript
<PB N="47" REF="182"> me to the Shirt. This new Ceremony &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed me, that I dur&s;t not &s;o much as ask my pretty <HI>Valets de Chamber</HI> the cau&s;e of it; and I cannot tell how my Guide, who asked me what I would begin with, could draw from me the&s;e two Words, <HI>A Potage;</HI> but hardly had I pronounced them, when I &s;melt the o|dour of the mo&s;t agreable Soop, that ever &s;teamed in the rich Gluttons No&s;e: I was about to ri&s;e from my place, that I might trace that delicious Scent to its &s;ource, but my Carrier hindered me: Whither are you going, &s;aid he, we &s;hall fetch a walk by and by; but now it is time to Eat, make an end of your <HI>Potage,</HI> and then we'll have &s;omething el&s;e: And where the Devil is the <HI>Potage?</HI> an&s;wered I half angry: Have you laid a wager you'll jeer me all this Day? I thought, replied he, that at the Town we came from, you had &s;een your Ma&s;ter or &s;ome Bo|el&s;e at meal, and that's the rea&s;on I told you not, how People feed in this Country. Seeing then you are &s;till ignorant, you mu&s;t know, that here they live on Steams. The art of Cookery is to &s;hut up in great Ve&s;&s;els, made on purpo&s;e, the Exhalations that proceed from the meat, whil&s;t it is a dre&s;&s;ing; and when they have provided enough of
<PB N="48" REF="183"> &s;everal &s;orts, and &s;everal ta&s;tes, according to the Appetite of tho&s;e they treat; they open one Ve&s;&s;el where that Steam is kept, and after that another; and &s;o on till all the Company be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s you have already lived after this manner, you would never think, that the No&s;e without Teeth and Gullet, can perform the office of the Mouth, in feed|ing a Man; but I'll make you experi|ence it your &s;elf. He had no &s;ooner &s;aid &s;o, but I found &s;o many agreable and nou|ri&s;hing Vapours enter the Parlour, one after another, that in le&s;s than half a quarter of an Hour I was fully &s;atisfi|ed. When we were got up; This is not a matter, &s;aid he, much to be admired at, &s;eeing you cannot have lived &s;o long, and not have ob&s;erved, that all &s;orts of Cooks, who eat le&s;s than People of another Calling, are neverthele&s;s much Fatter. Whence proceeds that Plumpne&s;s, d'ye think, unle&s;s it be from the Steams that continually environ them, which pene|trate into their Bodies, and fatten them? Hence it is, that the People of this World enjoy a more &s;teady and vigorous Health, by rea&s;on that their Food hardly engen|ders any Excrements, which are in a manner the original of all Diseases. You were, perhaps, &s;urpri&s;ed, that before &s;up|per
<PB N="49" REF="183"> you were &s;tript, &s;ince it is a Custom not practi&s;ed in your Country; but it is the fa&s;hion of this, and for this end u&s;ed, that the Animal may be the more tran|&s;pirable to the Fumes. Sir, an&s;wered I, there is a great deal of probability in what you &s;ay, and I have found &s;omewhat of it my &s;elf by experience; but I mu&s;t frankly tell you, That not be|ing able to Unbrute my &s;elf &s;o &s;oon, I &s;hould be glad to feel &s;omething, that my Teeth might fix upon: He promi&s;|ed I &s;hould, but not before next Day; becau&s;e, &s;aid he, to Eat &s;o &s;oon after your meal, would breed Crudities. After we had di&s;cour&s;ed a little longer, we went up to a Chamber to take our re&s;t; a Man met us on the top of the Stairs; who having attentively Eyed us, led me into a Clo&s;et, where the floor was &s;trow|ed with Orange-Flowers Three Foot thick, and my Spririt into another, filled with Gilly-Flowers and Je&s;&s;amine: Perceiving me amazed at that Magnificence, he told me, they were the Beds of the Country. In fine, we laid our &s;elves down to re&s;t, in our &s;everal Cells, and &s;o &s;oon as I had &s;tretched my &s;elf out upon my Flow|ers, by the light of Thirty large Glow-worms &s;hut up in a Chrystal, (being the only Candles <HI>Charon</HI> u&s;es,) I per|ceived
<PB N="50" REF="184"> the Three or Four Boys, who had &s;tript me before Supper, One tick|ling my Feet, another my Thighs, the Third my Flanks, and the Fourth my Arms, and all &s;o delicately and daintily, that in le&s;s than a Minute I was fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Next Morning by Sun-ri&s;ing, my Spi|rit came into my Room, and &s;aid to me, Now I'll be as good as my Word, you &s;hall breakfa&s;t this Morning, more &s;olidly than you Supped la&s;t Night. With that I got up, and he led me by the Hand to a place, at the back of the Garden, where one of the Children of the Hou&s;e &s;tayed for us, with a Piece in his Hand, much like to one of our Fire-Locks. He asked my Guide, if I would have a dozen of Larks, becau&s;e <HI>Baboons</HI> (one of which he took me to be,) loved to feed on them? I had hardly an&s;wered, Yes, when the Fowler di&s;charged a Shot, and Twenty or Thirty Larks fell at our Feet ready Roa&s;ted. This, thought I pre&s;ent|ly with my &s;elf, verifies the Proverb in our World, of a Country where Larks fall ready Roa&s;ted; without doubt, it has been made by &s;ome Body that came from hence. Fall too, fall too, &s;aid my Spirit, don't &s;pare; for they have a knack of ming|ling a certain Compo&s;ition with their
<PB N="51" REF="27"> Powder and Shot, which Kills, Plucks, Roa&s;ts, and Sea&s;ons the Fowl all at once. I took up &s;ome of them, and eat them upon his word; and to &s;ay the Truth, In all my Life time, I never eat any thing &s;o delicious. Having thus Breakfa&s;ted, we prepared to be gone, and with a Thou|&s;and odd Faces, which they u&s;e when they would &s;hew their Love; our Landlord received a Paper from my Spirit. I ask|ed him, if it was a Note for the Reckon|ing? He replied, No, that all was paid, and that it was a Copy of Ver&s;es. How! Ver&s;es, &s;aid I, are your Inn-Keepers here curious of Rhime then? It's, &s;aid he, the Money of the Country, and the charge we have been at here, hath been computed to amount to Three <HI>Coup|lets,</HI> or Six Ver&s;es, which I have given him. I did not fear we &s;hould out-run the Con&s;table; for though we &s;hould Pamper our &s;elves for a whole Week; we could not &s;pend a <HI>Sonnet,</HI> and I have Four about me, be&s;ides Two
<HI>Epigrams,</HI> Two <HI>Odes,</HI> and an <HI>Eclogue.</HI> Would to God, &s;aid I, it were &s;o in our World; for I know a good many hone&s;t Poets there, who are ready to Starve, and who might live plentifully, if that Money would pa&s;s in Payment. I farther asked him, If the&s;e Ver&s;es would always &s;erve,
<PB N="52" REF="28"> if one Tran&s;cribed them? He made an|&s;wer, No, and &s;o went on. When an Author has Compo&s;ed any; he carries them to the Mint, where the &s;worn Po|ets of the Kingdom &s;it in Court. There the&s;e ver&s;ifying Officers e&s;&s;ay the pieces; and if they be judged Sterling, they are rated not according to their Coyn; that's to &s;ay, That a <HI>Sonnet</HI> is not always as good as a <HI>Sonnet;</HI> but according to the intrin&s;ick value of the piece; &s;o that if any one Starve, he mu&s;t be a Blockhead: For Men of Wit make always good Chear. With Exta&s;ie, I was admiring the judicious Po|licy of that Country, when he proceeded in this manner: There are others who keep Publick-hou&s;e, after a far different manner: When one is about to be gone, they demand proportionably to the Char|ges, an Acquittance for the other World; and when that is given them, they write down in a great Regi&s;ter, which they call <HI>Doom&s;day's Book,</HI> much after this manner.
<HI>Item,</HI> The value of &s;o many Ver&s;es, delivered &s;uch a Day, to &s;uch a Per&s;on, which he is to pay upon the re|ceipt of this Acquittance, out of his rea|die&s;t Ca&s;h: And when they find them|&s;elves in danger of Death, they cau&s;e the&s;e Regi&s;ters to be Chopt in pieces, and &s;wal|low them down; becau&s;e they believe,
<PB N="53" REF="28"> that if they were not thus dige&s;ted, they would be good for nothing.</P>
<P>This Conver&s;ation was no hinderance to our Journey; for my Four-legged Porter jogged on under me, and I rid &s;tradling on his Back. I &s;hall not be particular in re|lating to you, all the Adventures, that happened to us on our way, till we arri|ved at length at the Town, where the King holds his Re&s;idence. I was no &s;ooner come, but they carryed me to the Palace, where the Grandees received me with more Moderation, than the People had done, as I pa&s;&s;ed the Streets: But both great and &s;mall concluded, That, without doubt, I was the Female of the Queen's little Animal. My Guide was my Interpreter; and yet he him&s;elf un|der&s;tood not the Riddle, and knew not what to make of that little Animal of the Queen's; but we were &s;oon &s;atis|fied as to that; for the King having &s;ome time con&s;idered me, ordered it to be brought, and about half an hour after, I &s;aw a company of Apes, wearing Ruffs and Breeches, come in, and among&s;t them a little Man, almo&s;t of my own Built, for he went on Two Legs; &s;o &s;oon as he per|ceived me, he Acco&s;ted me with a <HI>Cria|do de vue&s;tra merced.</HI> I an&s;wered his Greeting, much in the &s;ame Terms. But
<PB N="54" REF="29" MS="y"> alas! no &s;ooner had they &s;een us talk to|gether, but they believed their Conjecture to be true; and &s;o, indeed, it &s;eemed; for he of all the By-&s;tanders, that pa&s;t the mo&s;t favourable Judgment upon us, prote&s;ted, that our Conver&s;ation, was a Chattering we kept for Joy at our meet|ing again. That little Man told me, that he was an <HI>European,</HI> a Native of old <HI>Ca&s;til|le:</HI> That he had found a means by the help of Birds, to mount up to the World of the Moon, where then we were: That falling into the Queen's Hands, &s;he had taken him for a Monkey, becau&s;e Fate would have it &s;o: That in that Country they cloath Apes in a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s; and that upon his arrival, being found in that ha|bit, &s;he had made no doubt, but he was of the &s;ame kind. It could not other|wi&s;e be, replied I, but having tried all Fa&s;hions of Apparel upon them, none were found &s;o Ridiculous, and by con&s;equence more becoming a kind of Animals, which are only entertained for Plea&s;ure and Di|ver&s;ion. That &s;hews you little under|&s;tand the Dignity of our Nation, an&s;wered he, for whom the Univer&s;e breeds Men, only to be our Slaves, and Nature produces nothing but objects of Mirth and Laugh|ter. He then intreated me to tell him, how I dur&s;t be &s;o bold, as to Scale the Moon
<PB N="55" REF="29"> with the Machine I told him of? I an|&s;wered, That it was becau&s;e he had carried a way the Birds, which I intended to have made u&s;e of. He &s;miled at this Raillery; and about a quarter of an hour after, the King commanded the Keeper of the Mon|keys to carry us back, with expre&s;s Orders to make the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and me lie together, that we might procreate a breed of Apes in his Kingdom. The King's Plea&s;ure was punctually obeyed; at which I was very glad, for the &s;atisfaction I had, of ha|ving a Mate to conver&s;e with, during the &s;olitude of my Brutification. One Day my Male (for I was taken for the Female) told me, That the true rea&s;on, which had obliged him to travel all over the Earth, and at length to abandon it for the Moon, was, that he could not find &s;o much as one Country, where even Imagination was at liberty. Look ye, &s;aid he, how the Wittie&s;t thing you can &s;ay, unle&s;s you wear a Cornered Cap, if it thwart the Principles of the Doctors of the Robe, you are an Ideot, a Fool, and &s;omething wor&s;e, perhaps. I was about to have been put into the Inqui&s;ition at home, for maintaining to the Pedants Teeth, That there was a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> and that I knew no one matter in the World, more Ponderous than another. I asked him, what probable
<PB N="56" REF="30"> Arguments he had, to confirm &s;o new an O|pinion? To evince that, an&s;wered he, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that there is but one Ele|ment; for though we &s;ee Water, Earth, Air and Fire di&s;tinct, yet are they never found to be &s;o perfectly pure, but that there &s;till remains &s;ome Mixture. For ex|ample, When you behold Fire, it is not Fire but Air much extended; the Air is but Water much dilated; Water is but liquified Earth, and the Earth it &s;elf, but conden&s;ed Water; and thus if you weigh Matter &s;eriou&s;ly, you'll find it is but one, which like an excellent Comedian here be|low acts all Parts, in all &s;orts of Dre&s;&s;es: Otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t admit as many Ele|ments, as there are kinds of Bodies: And if you ask me why Fire burns, and Wa|ter cools, &s;ince it is but one and the &s;ame matter, I an&s;wer, That that matter acts by Sympathy, according to the Di&s;po&s;iti|on it is in, at the time when it acts. Fire which is nothing but Earth al&s;o, more dilated than is fit for the con&s;titution of Air, &s;trives to change into it &s;elf, by Sym|pathy, what ever it meets with: Thus the heat of Coals, being the mo&s;t &s;ubtile Fire, and mo&s;t proper to penetrate a Bo|dy, at fir&s;t &s;lides through the pores of our Skin; and becau&s;e it is a new matter that fills us, it makes us exhale in Sweat;
<PB N="57" REF="30"> that Sweat dilated by the Fire is conver|ted to a Steam, and becomes Air; that Air being farther rarified by the heat of the
<HI>Antiperi&s;ta&s;is,</HI> or of the Neighbouring Stars, is called Fire, and the Earth abandoned by the Cold and Humidity, which were Ligaments to the whole, falls to the ground: Water, on the other hand, though it no ways differ from the matter of Fire, but in that it is clo&s;er, burns us not; becau&s;e that being den&s;e by Sympathy, it clo&s;es up the Bodies it meets with, and the Cold we feel is no more, but the effect of our Fle&s;h contracting it &s;elf, becau&s;e of the Vicinity of Earth or Water, which con|&s;trains it toa Re&s;emblance. Hence it is, that tho&s;e who are troubled with a Drop|&s;ie, convert all their nouri&s;hment into Water; and the Cholerick convert all the Blood, that is formed in their Liver, into Choler. It being then &s;uppo&s;ed, that there is but one Element; it is mo&s;t cer|tain, that all Bodies, according to their &s;e|veral qualities, incline equally towards the Center of the Earth.</P>
<P>But you'll ask me, Why then does Iron, Metal, Earth and Wood, de&s;|cend more &s;wiftly to the Center than a Sponge, if it be not that it is full of Air, which naturally tends upwards? That is not at all the Rea&s;on, and thus I
<PB N="58" REF="31"> make it out: Though a Rock fall with greater Rapidity than a Feather, both of them have the &s;ame inclination for the Journey; but a Cannon Bullet, for in|&s;tance, where the Earth pierced through, would precipitate with greater ha&s;te to the Center thereof, than a Bladder full of Wind; and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e that ma&s;s of Metal, is a great deal of Earth contract|ed into a little &s;pace, and that Wind a very little Earth in a large &s;pace: For all the parts of Matter, being &s;o clo&s;ely joined together in the Iron, encrea&s;e their force by their Union; becau&s;e being thus com|pacted, they are many that Fight again&s;t a few, &s;eeing a parcel of Air equal to the Bullet in Bigne&s;s, is not equal in Quan|tity.</P>
<P>Not to in&s;i&s;t on a long Deduction of Arguments to prove this, tell me in good earne&s;t, How a Pike, a Sword or a Dag|ger wound us? If it be not, becau&s;e the Steel, being a matter, wherein the parts are more continuous, and more clo&s;ely knit to|gether, than your Fle&s;h is, who&s;e Pores and Softne&s;s &s;hew, that it contains but very little Matter, within a great extent of Place; and that the point of the Steel that pricks us, being almo&s;t an innumerable number of Particles of matter, again&s;t a very little Fle&s;h, it forces it to yeild to the &s;tronger,
<PB N="59" REF="31"> in the &s;ame manner as a Squadron in clo&s;e order, will ea&s;ily break through a more open Battallion; for why does a Bit of red hot Iron, burn more than a Log of Wood all on Fire? Unle&s;s it be, that in the Iron, there is more Fire in a &s;mall &s;pace, &s;ee|ing it adheres, to all the parts of the Me|tal, than in the Wood which being very Spongy, by con&s;equence contains a great deal of <HI>Vacuity;</HI> and that <HI>Vacuity,</HI> being but a Privation of Being, cannot receive the form of Fire. But, you'll object, you &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> as if you had proved it, and that's begging of the que&s;tion: Well then I'll prove it, and though that diffi|culty be the Si&s;ter of the <HI>Gordian knot,</HI> yet my Arms are &s;trong enough to become its <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P>Let that vulgar Bea&s;t, then, who does not think it &s;elf a Man, had it not been told &s;o, an&s;wer me if it can: Suppo&s;e now there be but one Matter, as I think I have &s;ufficiently peoved; whence comes it, that according to its Appetite, it enlarges or con|tracts its &s;elf; whence is it, that a piece of Earth, by being Conden&s;ed becomes a Stone? Is it that the parts of that Stone are placed one with another, in &s;uch a manner, that wherever that grain of Sand is &s;ettled, even there, or in the &s;ame point, another grain of Sand is Lodged? That
<PB N="60" REF="32"> cannot be, no not according to their own Principles, &s;eeing there is no Penetration of Bodies: But that matter mu&s;t have crowd|ed together, and if you will, abridged it &s;elf, &s;o that it hath filled &s;ome place which was empty before. To &s;ay, that it is incom|prehen&s;ible, that there &s;hould be a Nothing in the World, that we are in part made up of Nothing: Why not, pray? Is not the whold World wrapt up in Nothing? Since you yield me this point, then confe&s;s ingeniou&s;ly, that it's as rational, that the World &s;hould have a Nothing within it, as Nothing about it.</P>
<P>I well perceive you'll put the que&s;tion to me, Why Water compre&s;&s;ed in a Ve&s;&s;el by the Fro&s;t &s;hould break it, if it be not to hinder a Vacuity? But I an&s;wer, That that only happens, becau&s;e the Air over|head, which as well as Earth and Water, tends to the Center, meeting with an emp|ty Tun by the way, takes up his Lodging there: If it find the pores of that Ve&s;&s;el, that's to &s;ay, the ways that lead to that void place, too narrow, too long, and too crooked, with impatience it breaks through and arrives at its Tun.</P>
<P>But not to trifle away time, in an&s;wering all their objections, I dare be bold to &s;ay, That if there were no <HI>Vacuity,</HI> there could be no Motion; or el&s;e a Penetration of Bo|dies
<PB N="61" REF="32"> mu&s;t be admitted; for it would be a little too ridiculous to think, that when a Gnat pu&s;hes back a parcel of Air with its Wings, that parcel drives another before it, that other another &s;till; and that &s;o the &s;tirring of the little Toe of a Flea, &s;hould rai&s;e a bunch upon the Back of the Uni|ver&s;e. When they are at a &s;tand, they have recour&s;e to Rarefaction: But in good earne&s;t, How can it be when a Body is rarified, that one Particle of the Ma&s;s does recede from another Particle, without leav|ing an empty Space betwixt them; mu&s;t not the two Bodies, which are ju&s;t &s;epara|ted, have been at the &s;ame time in the &s;ame place of this; and that &s;o they mu&s;t have all three penetrated each other? I expect you'll ask me, why through a Reed, a Syringe or a Pump, Water is forced to a&s;cend contrary to its inclination? To which I an&s;wer, That that's by violence, and that it is not the fear of a <HI>Vacuity,</HI> that turns it out of the right way; but that be|ing linked to the Air by an imperceptible Chain, it ri&s;es when the Air, to which it is joined, is rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>That's no &s;uch knotty Difficulty, when one knows the perfect Circle, and the deli|cate Concatenation of the Elements: For if you attentively con&s;ider the Slime, which joines the Earth and Water together in Mar|riage,
<PB N="62" REF="33"> you'll find that it is neither Earth nor Water; but the Mediator betwixt the&s;e Two Enemies. In the &s;ame manner, the Water and Air reciprocally &s;end a Mi&s;t, that dives into the Humours of both, to ne|gotiate a Peace betwixt them; and the Air is reconciled to the Fire, by means of an interpo&s;ing Exhalation which Unites them.</P>
<P>I believe he would have proceeded in his Di&s;cour&s;e, had they not brought us our Victuals; and &s;eeing we were a hungry, I &s;topt my Ears to his di&s;cour&s;e, and opened my Stomack to the Food they gave us.</P>
<P>I remember another time, when we were upon our Philo&s;ophy, for neither of us took plea&s;ure to Di&s;cour&s;e of mean things: I am vexed, &s;aid he, to &s;ee a Wit of your &s;tamp, infected with the Errors of the Vulgar. You mu&s;t know then, in &s;pight of the Pedantry of
<HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> with which your Schools in <HI>France</HI> &s;till ring, That every thing is in every thing; that's to &s;ay, for in&s;tance, That in the Water there is Fire, in the Fire Water, in the Air Earth, and in the Earth Air: Though that Opinion makes Scho|lars open their Eyes as big as Sawcers, yet it is ea&s;ier to prove it, than per&s;wade it. For I ask them, in the fir&s;t place, if Wa|ter does not breed Fi&s;h: If they deny it, let them dig a Pit, fill it with meer Ele|ment,
<PB N="63" REF="33"> and to prevent all blind Objections, let them if they plea&s;e, &s;train it through a Strainer, and I'll oblige my &s;elf, in ca&s;e they find no Fi&s;h therein, within a certain time, to drink up all the Water they have poured into it: But if they find Fi&s;h, as I make no doubt on't; it is a convincing Argument, that there is both Salt and Fire there. Con&s;equentially now, to find Wa|ter in Fire; I take it to be no difficult Task. For let them chu&s;e Fire, even that which is mo&s;t ab&s;tracted from Matter, as Comets are, there is a great deal in them &s;till; &s;eeing if that Unctuous Humour, whereof they are engendred, being redu|ced to a Sulphur, by the heat of the Anti|peri&s;ta&s;is which kindles them, did not find a curb of its Violence in the humid Cold, that qualifies and re&s;i&s;ts it, it would &s;pend it &s;elf in a trice like Lightning. Now that there is Air in the Earth, they will not de|ny it; or otherwi&s;e they have never heard of the terrible Earth-quakes, that have &s;o of|ten &s;haken the Mountains of <HI>Sicily:</HI> Be|&s;ides, the Earth is full of Pores, even to the lea&s;t grains of Sand that compa&s;s it. Ne|verthele&s;s, no Man hath as yet &s;aid, that the&s;e Hollows were filled with <HI>Vacuity:</HI> It will not be taken ami&s;s then, I hope, if the Air takes up its quarters there. It remains to be proved, that there is Earth in
<PB N="64" REF="34"> the Air; but I think it &s;carcely worth my pains, &s;eeing you are convinced of it, as of|ten as you &s;ee, &s;uch numberle&s;s Legions of Atomes fall upon your heads, as even &s;tiffle Arithmetick.</P>
<P>But let us pa&s;s from &s;imple to compound Bodies, they'll furni&s;h me with much more frequent Subjects; and to demon&s;trate that all things are in all things, not that they change into one another, as your
<HI>Peripate|ticks</HI> Juggle, (for I will maintain to their Teeth, that the Principles mingle, &s;eparate, and mingle again in &s;uch a manner, that that hath been made Water by the Wi&s;e Creator of the World, will always be Water:) I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e no Maxime, as they do, but what I prove.</P>
<P>And therefore take a Billet, or any other combu&s;tible &s;tuff, and &s;et Fire to it, they'll &s;ay when it is in a Flame, That what was Wood is now become Fire; but I main|tain the contrary, and that there is no more Fire in it, when it is all in Flame, than before it was kindled; but that which be|fore was hid in the Billet, and by the Hu|midity and Cold hindered from acting; being now a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Stronger, hath rallied its forces again&s;t the Phlegm that choaked it, and commanding the Field of Bat|tle, that was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by its Enemy, triumphs over his Jaylor, and appears without Fet|ters.
<PB N="65" REF="34"> Don't you &s;ee how the Water flees out at the two ends of the Billet, hot and &s;moaking from the Fight it was engaged in. That flame which you &s;ee ri&s;e on high, is the purer Fire, unpe&s;tered from the Mat|ter, and by con&s;equence the readie&s;t to re|turn home to it &s;elf: Neverthele&s;s it Unites it &s;elf, by tapering into a Piramide, till it ri&s;e to a certain height, that it may pierce through the thick Humidity of the Air, which re&s;i&s;ts it; but as in mounting it di&s;|engages it &s;elf by little and little, from the violent company of its Landlords; &s;o it diffu&s;es it &s;elf, becau&s;e then it meets with nothing that thwarts its pa&s;&s;age, which negligence, though, is many times the cau&s;e of a &s;econd Captivity: For marching &s;tragglingly, it wanders &s;ometimes into a Cloud, and if it meet there with a Party of its own, &s;ufficient to make head again&s;t a Vapour; they Engage, Grumble, Thun|der and Roar, and the Death of Innocents is many times the effect of the animated Rage, of tho&s;e inanimated Things. If when it finds it &s;elf pe&s;tered, among tho&s;e Crudities of the middle Region, it is not &s;trong enough to make a defence; it yields to its Enemy upon di&s;cretion, which by its weight, con&s;trains it to fall again to the Earth: And this Wretch, inclo&s;ed in a drop of Rain, may, perhaps, fall at the Foot of an
<PB N="66" REF="35"> Oak, who&s;e Animal Fire will invite the poor Straggler, to take a Lodging with him; and thus you have it in the &s;ame condition again, as it was a few Days be|fore.</P>
<P>But let us trace the Fortune of the other Elements, that compo&s;ed that Billet. The Air retreats to its own Quarters al&s;o, though blended with Vapours; becau&s;e the Fire all in a rage, drove them briskly out
<HI>Pell-mell</HI> together. Now you have it &s;erv|ing the Winds for a Tennis-ball, furni&s;hing Breath to Animals, filling up the Vacuities that Nature hath left; and, it may be, al&s;o wrapt up in a drop of Dew, &s;uckling the thir|&s;ty Leaves of that Tree, whither our Fire re|treated: The Water driven from its Throne by the Flame, being by the heat elevated to the Nur&s;ery of the Meteors, will di&s;til a|gain in Rain upon our Oak, as &s;oon as up|on another; and the Earth being turned to A&s;hes, and then cured of its Sterility, ei|ther by the nouri&s;hing Heat of a Dunghill, on which it hath been thrown, or by the vegetative Salt of &s;ome neighbouring Plants, or by the teeming Waters of &s;ome Rivers, may happen al&s;o to be near this Oak, which by the heat of its Germ, will at|tract it, and convert it into a part of its bulk.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="35"> In this manner, the&s;e Four Elements un|dergo the &s;ame De&s;tiny, and return to the &s;ame State, which they quitted but a few days before: So that it may be &s;aid, that all that's nece&s;&s;ary for the compo&s;ition of a Tree, is in a Man; and in a Tree, all that's nece&s;&s;ary for making of a Man. In fine, according to this way, all things will be found in all things; but we want a <HI>Pro|metheus,</HI> to pluck us out of the Bo&s;om of Na|ture, and render us &s;en&s;ible, which I am willing to call the
<HI>Fir&s;t Matter.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were the things, I think, with which we pa&s;t the time; for that little <HI>Spa|niard</HI> had a quaint Wit. Our conver&s;ation, however, was only in the Night time; be|cau&s;e from Six a clock in the morning un|til night, Crowds of the People that came to &s;tare at us in our Lodging, would have di&s;turbed us: For &s;ome threw us Stones, others Nuts, and others Gra&s;s; there was no talk, but of the Kings Bea&s;ts; we had our Victuals daily at &s;et hours, and the King and Queen took the pains often to feel my Belly, to &s;ee if I did not begin to &s;well, for they had an extraordinary de&s;ire to have a Race of the&s;e little Animals. I cannot tell, whether it was that I minded their Ge&s;tures and Tones, more than my Male did: But I learnt &s;ooner than he, to under&s;tand their Language, and to &s;matter
<PB N="68" REF="36"> a little in it, which made us to be lookt upon, in another gue&s;s manner than former|ly; and the news thereupon flew pre&s;ently all over the Kingdom, that two Wild Men had been found, who were le&s;s than other Men, by rea&s;on of the bad Food we had had in the De&s;arts; and who through a defect of their Parents Seed, had not the fore Legs &s;trong enough to &s;upport their Bo|dies.</P>
<P>This belief would have taken rooting, by being &s;pread, had it not been for the Learned Men of the Country, who oppo|&s;ed it, &s;aying, That it was horrid Impiety to believe, not only Bea&s;ts, but Mon&s;ters to be of their kind. It would be far more probable, (added the calmer Sort) that our Dome&s;tick Bea&s;ts, &s;hould participate of the priviledge of Humanity, and by con&s;e|quence of Immortality, as being bred in our Country, than a Mon&s;trous Bea&s;t, that talks of being born I know not where, in the Moon; and then ob&s;erve the difference be|twixt us and them. We walk upon Four Feet, becau&s;e God would not tru&s;t &s;o pre|cious a thing, upon weaker Supporters, and he was afraid lea&s;t marching other|wi&s;e, &s;ome Mi&s;chance might befall Man; and therefore he took the pains, to re&s;t him upon four Pillars, that he might not fall, but di&s;daining to have a hand in

<P>Birds them&s;elves, &s;aid they, have not had &s;o hard mea&s;ure as they; for they have got Feathers, at lea&s;t to &s;upply the weakne&s;s of their Legs, and to ca&s;t them|&s;elves in the Air, when we pur&s;ue them; whereas Nature, depriving the&s;e Mon&s;ters of Two Legs, hath di&s;abled them from &s;caping our Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, con&s;ider a little how they have the Head rai&s;ed toward Heaven, it is be|cau&s;e God would puni&s;h them with &s;carci|ty of all things, that he hath &s;o placed them; for that &s;upplicant Po&s;ture, &s;hews that they complain to Heaven of him that Created them, and that they beg Permi&s;&s;i|on to make their be&s;t of our Leavings. But we, on the contrary, have the Head bend|ing downwards, to behold the Ble&s;&s;ings, whereof we are the Ma&s;ters, and as if there were nothing in Heaven, that our happy condition needed Envy.</P>
<P>I heard &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, or the like, daily at my Lodge; and at length they &s;o curb|ed the minds of the people, as to that point, that it was decreed, That at be&s;t, I &s;hould only pa&s;s for a Parrot without Feathers;
<PB N="70" REF="37"> for they confirmed tho&s;e, who were already per&s;waded, in that I had but two Legs no more than a Bird, which was the cau&s;e that I was put into a Cage, by expre&s;s orders from the Privy Council.</P>
<P>There the Queen's Bird-keeper, taking the pains daily to teach me to Whi&s;tle, as they do Stares or Singing-Birds here, I was really happy in that I wanted not Food: In the mean while, with the Sonnets the Spectators &s;tunned me, I learnt to &s;peak as they did; &s;o that when I was got to be &s;o much Ma&s;ter of the Idiom, as to expre&s;s mo&s;t of my thoughts, I told them the fi|ne&s;t of my Conceits. The Quaintne&s;s of my Sayings, was already the entertainment of all Societies, and my Wit was &s;o much e&s;teemed, that the Council was obliged to Publi&s;h an Edict, forbidding all People to believe, that I was endowed with Rea|&s;on; with expre&s;s Commands to all Per|&s;ons, of what Quality or Condition &s;oever, not to imagine, but that whatever I did, though never &s;o wittily, proceeded only from In&s;tinct.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the deci&s;ion of what I was, divided the Town into Two Factions. The party that &s;tood for me, encrea&s;ed daily; and at length in &s;pight of the <HI>Anathema,</HI> whereby they endeavoured to &s;care the mul|titude: They who held for me, demand|ed
<PB N="71" REF="37"> a Convention of the States, for determin|ing that Controver&s;ie. It was long before they could agree, in the Choice of tho&s;e who &s;hould have a Vote; but the Arbitrators pa|cified the heat, by making the number of both parties equal, who ordered that I &s;hould be brought unto the A&s;&s;embly, as I was: But I was treated there with all ima|ginable Severity. My Examiners, among&s;t other things, put que&s;tions of Philo&s;o|phy to me; I ingenuou&s;ly told them, all that my Tutor had heretofore taught me, but they ea&s;ily refuted me by more con|vincing Arguments: So that having no|thing to an&s;wer for my &s;elf, my la&s;t refuge was to the Principles of
<HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which &s;tood me in as little &s;tead, as his Sophi&s;ms did; for in two Words, they let me &s;ee the fal&s;ity of them. That &s;ame
<HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> &s;aid they, who&s;e Learning you brag &s;o much of, did without doubt accommodate Prin|ciples to his Philo&s;ophy; in&s;tead of ac|commodating his Philo&s;ophy to Principles; and be&s;ides he ought to have proved them, at lea&s;t to be more rational, than tho&s;e of the other Sects, you mentioned to us: Wherefore the good Man will not take it ill, we hope, if we bid him God b'w'. In fine, when they perceived that I did nothing but bawl, that they were not more knowing than <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and that I was
<PB N="72" REF="38"> forbid to di&s;pute again&s;t tho&s;e who denied his Principles: They all unanimou&s;ly con|cluded, That I was not a Man, but, per|haps, a kind of <HI>Estriage,</HI> &s;eeing I carried my Head upright like them, that I walked on two Legs; and that, in &s;hort, but for a little Down, I was every way like one of them, &s;o that the Bird-keeper was ordered to have me back to my Cage. I &s;pent my time pretty plea&s;antly there, for becau&s;e I had correctly learned their Language, the whole Court took plea&s;ure to make me prattle. The Queen's Maids, among the re&s;t, &s;lipt always &s;ome Boon into my Basket; and the gentile&s;t of them all, hav|ing conceived &s;ome kindne&s;s for me, was &s;o tran&s;ported with Joy, when in private I entertained her, with the manners and di|verti&s;ements of the People of our World, and e&s;pecially our Bells, and other In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, that &s;he prote&s;ted to me, with Tears in her Eyes, That if ever I found my &s;elf in a condition to fly back again to our World, &s;he would follow me with all her Heart.</P>
<P>One Morning early, having &s;tarted out of my Sleep, I found her Taboring upon the grates of my Cage: Take good heart, &s;aid &s;he to me, ye&s;terday in Council, a War was re&s;olved upon, again&s;t the King
<GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> I hope that during the
<PB N="73" REF="38"> hurry of Preparations, whil&s;t our Mo|narch and his Subjects are ab&s;ent, I may find an occa&s;ion to make your e&s;cape. How, a War, &s;aid I interruping her, have the Princes of this World, then, any quar|rels among&s;t them&s;elves, as tho&s;e of ours have? Good now, let me know their way of Fighting.</P>
<P>When the Arbitrators, replied &s;he, who are freely cho&s;en by the two Parties, have appointed the time for rai&s;ing Forces for their March, the number of Combatants, the day and place of Battle, and all with &s;o great equality, that there is not one Man more in one Army, than in the other: All the maimed Soldiers on the one &s;ide, are li&s;ted in one Company; and when they come to engage, the <HI>Mare&s;halls de Camp,</HI> take care to expo&s;e them to the maimed of the other &s;ide: The Giants are matched with Colo&s;&s;es, the Fencers with tho&s;e that can handle their Weapons, the Vali|ant with the Stout, the Weak with the Infirm, the Sick with the Indi&s;po&s;ed, the Sturdy with the Strong; and if any un|dertake to &s;trike at another, than the E|nemy he is matched with, unle&s;s he can make it out, that it was by mi&s;take, he is Condemned for a Coward. When the Battle is over, they take an account of the Wounded, the Dead and the Pri&s;o|ners,
<PB N="74" REF="39"> for Run-aways they have none; and if the lo&s;s be equal on both &s;ides, they draw Cuts, who &s;hall be Proclaimed Victori|ous.</P>
<P>But though a Kingdom hath defeated the Enemy in open War, yet there is hardly any thing got by it; for there are other &s;maller Armies of Learned and Wit|ty Men, on who&s;e Di&s;putations the Tri|umph or Servitude of States wholly de|pends.</P>
<P>One Learned Man grapples with ano|ther, one Wit with another, and one Ju|dicious Man with another Judicious Man: Now the Triumph which a State gains in this manner, is reckoned as good as three Victories by open force. After the Pro|clamation of Victory, the A&s;&s;embly is bro|ken up, and the Victorious People, either chu&s;e the Enemies King to be theirs, or con|firm their own.</P>
<P>I could not forbear to Laugh, at this &s;crupulous way of giving Battle; and for an Example of much &s;tronger Politicks, I alledged the Cu&s;toms of our <HI>Europe,</HI> where the Monarch would be &s;ure, not to let &s;lip any favourable occa&s;ion of gaining the day; but mind what &s;he &s;aid as to that.</P>
<P>Tell me, pray, if your Princes u&s;e not a pretext of Right, when they levy Arms: No doubt, an&s;wered I, and of
<PB N="75" REF="39"> the Ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e too. Why then, replied &s;he, do they not chu&s;e Impartial and Un&s;u&s;pected Arbitrators to compo&s;e their Differences? And if it be found, that the one has as much Right as the other, let things continue as they were; or let them play a game at <HI>Picket,</HI> for the Town or Province that's in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>But why all the&s;e Circum&s;tances, re|plied I, in your way of Fighting? Is it not enough, that both Armies are equal in the number of Men? Your Judgment is Weak, an&s;wered &s;he. Would you think in Con&s;cience, that if you had the bet|ter of your Enemy, Hand to Hand, in an open Field, you had fairly overcome him, if you had had on a Coat of Mail, and he none; if he had had but a Dagger, and you a Tuck; and in a Word, if he had had but one Arm, and you both yours? Neverthele&s;s, what Equality &s;oe|ver you may recommend to your Gladia|tors, they never fight on even terms; for the one will be a tall Man, and the other Short; the one skilful at his Wea|pon, and the other a Man that never handled a Sword; the one will be &s;trong, and the other Weak: And though the&s;e Di&s;proportions were not, but that the one were as skillful and &s;trong as the o|ther; yet &s;till they might not be rightly
<PB N="76" REF="40"> matched; for one, perhaps, may have more Courage than the other, who being ra&s;h and hot-headed, inconcerned in dan|ger, as not fore&s;eeing it, of a bilious Tem|per, a more contracted Heart, with all the qualities that con&s;titute Courage, (as if that, as well as a Sword, were not a Weapon which his Adver&s;ary hath not:) He makes nothing of falling de&s;perately, upon terrifying and killing this poor Man, who fore&s;ees the danger; has his Heat choked in Phlegme, and a Heart too wide to clo&s;e in the Spirits in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as is nece&s;&s;ary for thawing that Ice, which is called Cowardi&s;e. And now you prai&s;e that Man, for having kill|ed his Enemy at odds, and prai&s;ing him for his Boldne&s;s, you prai&s;e him for a Sin again&s;t nature; &s;eeing &s;uch Boldne&s;s tends to its de&s;truction. And this puts me in mind to tell ye, that &s;ome Years ago, ap|plication was made to the Council of War, for a more circum&s;pect and con&s;cientious Rule to be made, as to the way of Fight|ing. The Philo&s;opher who gave the ad|vice, if I mi&s;take it not, &s;pake in this manner.</P>
<P>You imagine, Gentlemen, that you have very equally balanced the advantages of two Enemies, when you have cho&s;en both Tall Men, both skillful, and both couragi|ous: But that's not enough, &s;eeing after
<PB N="77" REF="40"> all, the Conquerour mu&s;t have the better on't, either through his Skill, Strength, or good Fortune. If it be by Skill, without doubt he hath taken his Adver&s;ary on the blind &s;ide, which he did not expect; or &s;truck him &s;ooner than was likely, or faining to make his Pa&s;s on one &s;ide, he hath attacked him on the other: Never|thele&s;s all this is Cunning, Cheating, and Treachery, and none of the&s;e make a brave Man: If he hath triumphed by Force, would you judge his Enemy over-come, be|cau&s;e he hath been over-powered? No; doubtle&s;s, no more than you'll &s;ay, that a Man hath lo&s;t the Victory, when over|whelm'd by a Mountain, it was not in his power to gain it: Even &s;o, the other was not overcome, becau&s;e he was not in a &s;uitable Di&s;po&s;ition, at that nick of time, to re&s;i&s;t the violences of his Adver&s;ary. If Chance hath given him the better of his E|nemy, Fortune ought then to be Crowned, &s;ince he hath contributed nothing to it; and, in fine, the vanqui&s;hed is no more to be blamed, than he who at Dice having thrown Seventeen, is beat by another that throws three Sixes.</P>
<P>They confe&s;&s;ed he was in the right; but that it was impo&s;&s;ible, according to humane Appearances, to remedy it; and that it was better, to &s;ubmit to a &s;mall inconvenience,
<PB N="78" REF="41"> than to open a door to a hundred of greater Importance.</P>
<P>She entertained me no longer at that time, becau&s;e &s;he was afraid to be found alone with me &s;o early; not that Impu|dicity is a Crime in that Country: On the contrary, except Malefactors Con|victed, all Men have power over all Wo|men; and in the &s;ame manner, a Wo|man may bring her Action again&s;t a Man for refu&s;ing her: But &s;he dur&s;t not keep me company publickly, becau&s;e the Mem|bers of Council, at their la&s;t meeting, had &s;aid, That it was chiefly the Women who gave it out that I was a Man, that under that pretext they might cover the violent de&s;ire they had of enjoying Bea&s;ts, and of committing with me &s;ins again&s;t Nature, without a blu&s;h; which was the rea&s;on, that for a long time, I neither &s;aw her, nor any other of her Sex.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;ome mu&s;t needs have revived the Di&s;putes, about the De|finition of my Being; for whil&s;t I was thinking of nothing el&s;e, but of dying in my Cage, I was once more brought out to have another Audience. I was then que&s;tioned, in pre&s;ence of a great many Courtiers, upon &s;ome points of Na|tural Philo&s;ophy; and, as I take it, my An&s;wers gave &s;ome kind of Satisfacti|on;
<PB N="79" REF="41"> for the Pre&s;ident declared to me at large, his thoughts concerning the &s;tru|cture of the World. They &s;eemed to me very ingenious; and had he not traced it to its Original, which he maintained to be Eternal, I &s;hould have thought his Philo&s;ophy more rational than our own: But as &s;oon as I heard him maintain a Foppery, &s;o contrary to our Faith, I broke with him; at which he did but laugh; and that obliged me to tell him, That &s;ince they were therea|bouts with it, I began again to think, that their World was but a Moon. But then all cried, Don't you &s;ee here Earth, Rivers, Seas? what's all that then? No matter, &s;aid I, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> a&s;&s;ures us it is but a Moon; and if you had &s;aid the contrary in the Schools, where I have been bred, you would have been hi&s;&s;ed at. At this they all bur&s;t out in laughter; you need not ask, if it was their Ignorance, that made them do &s;o; for in the mean time I was carried back to my Cage.</P>
<P>But &s;ome more pa&s;&s;ionate Doctors, be|ing informed, that I had the boldne&s;s to affirm, That the Moon, from whence I came, was a World; and that their World was no more but a Moon, thought it might give them a very ju&s;t pretext, to have me condemned to the Water; for
<PB N="80" REF="42"> that's their way of rooting out Hereticks. For that end, they went in a Body, and com|plained to the King, who promi&s;ed them Ju&s;tice; and order'd me once more to be brought to the Bar.</P>
<P>Now was I the third time Un-caged; and then the mo&s;t Ancient &s;poke, and pleaded again&s;t me. I do not well re|member his Speech; becau&s;e I was too much frighted, to receive the tones of his Voice without di&s;order; and becau&s;e al&s;o in declaiming, he made u&s;e of an In&s;tru|ment, which &s;tunn'd me with its noi&s;e: It was a Speaking-Trumpet, which he had cho&s;en on purpo&s;e, that by its Mar|tial Sound he might rou&s;e them to my death; and by that Emotion of their Spi|rits, hinder Rea&s;on from performing its Office: As it happens in our Armies, where the noi&s;e of Drums and Trumpets, hinders the Souldiers from minding the importance of their Lives. When he had done, I ro&s;e up to defend my Cau&s;e; but I was excu|&s;ed from it, by an Accident that will &s;ur|prize you. Ju&s;t as I had opened my Mouth, a Man, who with much ado had pre&s;&s;ed through the Crowd, fell at the King's Feet, and a long while rouled him|&s;elf upon his Back in his pre&s;ence. This practice did not at all &s;urprize me, becau&s;e I knew it to be the po&s;ture they put
<PB N="81" REF="42"> them&s;elves into, when they have a mind to be heard in publick: I only &s;topt my own Harangue, and gave Ear to his.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t Judges, &s;aid he, li&s;ten to me; you cannot Condemn that Man, that Monkey or Parrot, for &s;aying, That the Moon, from whence he comes, is a World; for if he be a Man, though he were not come from the Moon, &s;ince all Men are free, is not he free al&s;o, to imagine what he plea&s;es? How, can you con&s;train him not to have Vi&s;ions, as well as you? You may very well force him to &s;ay, That the Moon is not a World, but he will not believe it for all that; for to believe a thing, &s;ome po&s;&s;ibilities enclining more to the Yea, than to the Nay, mu&s;t offer to ones Imagination: And unle&s;s you furni&s;h him with that Pro|bability, or his own mind hit upon it, he may very well tell you, that he believes, but &s;till remain an Infidel.</P>
<P>I am now to prove, that he ought not to be condemned, if you li&s;t him in the Cata|logue of Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>For &s;uppo&s;e him to be an Animal with|out Rea&s;on, would it be rational in you to Condemn him, for offending again&s;t it? He hath &s;aid, that the Moon is a World. Now Bea&s;ts act only by the in&s;tinct of Nature: it is Nature then that &s;ays &s;o, and not he: To think that wi&s;e Nature, who
<PB N="82" REF="43"> hath made the World, and the Moon knows not her &s;elf what it is; and that ye who have no more Knowledge, but what ye derive from her, &s;hould more certainly know it, would be very Ridiculous. But if Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould make you renounce your Principles, and you &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that Nature does not guide Bea&s;ts; blu&s;h, at lea&s;t, to think on't, that the Caprices of a Bea&s;t &s;hould &s;o di&s;compo&s;e you. Really, Gentlemen, &s;hould you meet with a Man come to the Years of Di&s;cretion, who made it his bu|&s;ine&s;s to in&s;pect the Government of <HI>Pi&s;|mires,</HI> giving a blow to one that had over|thrown its Companion, impri&s;oning another that had robb'd its Neighbour of a grain of Corn, and inditing a third, for leaving its Eggs; would you not think him a mad Man, to be employed in things &s;o far be|low him, and to pretend to give Laws to Animals, that never had Rea&s;on? How will you then, mo&s;t Venerable A&s;&s;embly, ju&s;tifie your &s;elves, for being &s;o concerned at the Caprices of that little Animal? Ju&s;t Judges, I have no more to &s;ay.</P>
<P>When he had made an end, all the Hall rung again with a kind of Mu&s;ical Applau&s;e; and after all the Opinions had been canva|&s;ed, during the &s;pace of a large quarter of an hour, the King gave Sentence:</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="43"> That for the future, I &s;hould be reput|ed to be a Man, accordingly &s;et at liberty; and that the Puni&s;hment of being Drown|ed, &s;hould be converted into a publick Di&s;grace (the mo&s;t honourable way of &s;a|tisfying the Law in that Country) where|by I &s;hould be obliged to retract openly, what I had maintained, in &s;aying, That the Moon was a World, becau&s;e of the Scan|dal, that the novelty of that opinion, might give to weak Brethren.</P>
<P>This Sentence being pronounced, I was taken away out of the Palace, richly Cloath|ed; but in deri&s;ion, carried in a magnifi|cent Chariot, as on a Tribunal; which four Princes in Harne&s;s drew, and in all the publick places of the Town, I was forced to make this Declaration:</P>
<P>Good People, I declare to you, That this Moon here is not a Moon, but a World; and that that World below is not a World, but a Moon: This the Council thinks fit you &s;hould believe. After I had Proclaimed this, in the five great places of the Town; my Advocate came and reach|ed me his Hand to help me down. I was in great amaze, when after I had Eyed him, I found him to be my Spirit; we were an hour in embracing one another: Come lodge with me, &s;aid he, for if you return to Court, after a Publick Di&s;grace,
<PB N="84" REF="44"> you will not be well lookt upon: Nay more, I mu&s;t tell you, that you would have been &s;till among&s;t the Apes yonder, as well as the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> your Companion; if I had not in all Companies publi&s;hed the vigour and force of your Wit, and gained from your Enemies, the protection of the great Men, in your favours. I cea&s;ed not to thank him all the way, till we came to his Lodgings; there he entertained me till Supper-time, with all the Engines he had &s;et a work to prevail with my Enemies. Notwith&s;tanding, the mo&s;t &s;pecious pre|texts they had u&s;ed for riding the Mobile, to de&s;i&s;t from &s;o unju&s;t a Pro&s;ecution: But as they came to acquaint us, that Supper was upon the Table, he told me, that to bear me company that evening, he had in|vited Two Profe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ity of the Town to Sup with him: I'll make them, &s;aid he, fall upon the Philo&s;ophy, which they teach in this World, and by that means you &s;hall &s;ee my Landlord's Son: He's as Witty a Youth as ever I met with; he would prove another
<HI>Socrates,</HI> if he could u&s;e his Parts aright, and not bury in Vice the Graces wherewith God continually vi&s;its him, by affecting a Libertini&s;m, as he does, out of a Chi|merical O&s;tentation and Affectation of the name of a Wit. I have taken Lodg|ings
<PB N="85" REF="44"> here, that I may lay hold on all Opportunities of In&s;tructing him: He &s;aid no more, that he might give me the Liberty to &s;peak, if I had a mind to it; and then made a &s;ign, that they &s;hould &s;trip me of my di&s;graceful Orna|ments, in which I &s;till gli&s;tered.</P>
<P>The Two Profe&s;&s;ors, whom we ex|pected, entered, ju&s;t as I was undre&s;t, and we went to &s;it down to Table, where the Cloth was laid, and where we found the Youth, he had mentioned to me, fal|len to already. They made him a low Reverence, and treated him with as much re&s;pect, as a Slave does his Lord. I asked my Spirit the rea&s;on of that, who made me an&s;wer, that it was becau&s;e of his Age; &s;eeing in that World, the Aged rendered all kind of Re&s;pect and Diffe|rence to the Young; and which is far more, that the Parents obeyed their Chil|dren, &s;o &s;oon as by the Judgment of the Senate of Philo&s;ophers, they had attained to the Years of Di&s;cretion. You are ama|zed, continued he, at a Cu&s;tom &s;o con|trary to that of your Country; but it is not all repugnant to Rea&s;on: For &s;ay, in your Con&s;cience, when a brisk young Man is at his Prime in Imagining, Judg|ing, and Acting, is not he fitter to go|vern a Family, than a Decrepit piece of
<PB N="86" REF="45"> Three&s;core Years, dull and doting, who&s;e Imagination is frozen under the Snow of Sixty Winters, who follows no other Guide, but what you call, the Ex|perience of happy Succe&s;&s;es; and yet are no more, but the bare effects of Chance, again&s;t all the Rules and Oeconomy of humane Prudence? And as for Judg|ment, he hath but little of that neither, though the people of your World make it the Portion of Old Age: But to unde|ceive them, they mu&s;t know, That that which is called Prudence in an Old Man, is no more but a panick Apprehen&s;ion, and a mad Fear of acting any thing, where there is danger: So that when he does not run a Risk, wherein a Young Man hath lo&s;t him&s;elf; it is not that he fore&s;aw the Cata&s;trophe, but becau&s;e he had not Fire enough to kindle tho&s;e noble Fla&s;hes, which make us dare: Whereas the Boldne&s;s of that Young Man, was as a pledge of the good Suc|ce&s;s of his de&s;ign; becau&s;e the &s;ame Ar|dour that &s;peeds and facilitates the execu|tion, thru&s;t him upon the undertaking. As for Execution, I &s;hould wrong your Judgment; if I endeavoured to convince it by proofs: You know that Youth a|lone is proper for Action; and were you ont fully per&s;waded of this, tell me, pray,
<PB N="87" REF="45"> when you re&s;pect a Man of Courage, is it not becau&s;e he can revenge you on your Enemies or Oppre&s;&s;ors?

<P>The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, my Son, why Parents bear &s;o much re&s;pect to their Children: I know very well, that I have inclined to the Chil|drens &s;ide, more than in ju&s;tice I ought; and that in favour of them, I have &s;poken a little again&s;t my Con&s;cience. But &s;ince I was willing to repre&s;s the Pride of &s;ome Parents, who in&s;ult over the weakne&s;s of their little Ones; I have been forced to do as they do, who to make a crooked Tree &s;treight, bend it to the contrary &s;ide, that betwixt two Conver&s;ions it may be|come

Now &s;eeing, by not giving a Being to that Nothing, I leave it in a &s;tate wor&s;e than Death, I am more guilty in not producing, than in killing it. In the mean time, my little Man, thou would&s;t think thou had&s;t committed an unpardonable Parra|cide, &s;hould&s;t thou have cut thy Sons throat: It would indeed be an enor|mous Crime, but it is far more execrable, not to give a Being to that which is capable of receiving it: For that Child whom thou deprive&s;t of life for ever, hath had the &s;atisfaction of having en|joyed it for &s;ome time. Be&s;ides, we know that it is but deprived of it, but for &s;ome ages; but the&s;e forty poor little Nothings, which thou mighte&s;t have made forty good Souldiers for the King, thou art &s;o malicious as to deny them Life, and lette&s;t them corrupt in thy Reins, to the danger of an Apoplexy, which will &s;tifle thee.</P>
<P>This Philo&s;ophy did not at all plea&s;e me, which made me three or four times &s;hake my Head; but our Preceptor held his tongue, becau&s;e Supper was mad to be gone.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="49"> We laid our &s;elves along, then, upon very &s;oft Quilts, covered with large Car|pets; and a young man that waited on us, taking the olde&s;t of our Philo&s;ophers, led him into a little arlour apart, where my Spirit called to him, to come back to us, a&s;&s;oon as he had &s;upped.</P>
<P>This humour of eating &s;eparately, gave me the curio&s;ity of asking the Cau&s;e of it: He'll not reli&s;h, &s;aid he, the &s;team of Meat, nor yet of Herbs, unle&s;s they die of them&s;elves, becau&s;e he thinks they are &s;en&s;ible of Pain. I wonder not &s;o much, replied I, that he ab&s;tains from Fle&s;h, and all things that have had a &s;en&s;itive Life: For in our World the <HI>Py|thagoreans,</HI> and even &s;ome holy <HI>Anchorites,</HI> have followed that Rule; but not to dare, for in&s;tance, cut a Cabbage, for fear of hurting it; that &s;eems to me altoge|ther ridiculous. And for my part, an|&s;wered my Spirit, I find a great deal of probability in his Opinion.</P>
<P>For tell me, Is not that Cabbage you &s;peak of, a Being exi&s;tent in Nature, as well as you? Is not &s;he the common Mother of you both? Nay it would even &s;eem that &s;he hath taken more care of the Vegetable, than of the Rational, &s;ince &s;he hath referred the Generation of
<PB N="94" REF="50"> a Man to the Caprices of his Father, who may, according as he has a mind to it, beget him, or not beget him: A rigour wherewith &s;he hath not treated the Cabbage; for in&s;tead of remitting it to the di&s;cretion of the Father, to gene|rate the Son, as if &s;he had been more fearful, lea&s;t the Race of Cabbage &s;hould peri&s;h, than that of Man; &s;he for|ces them, whether they will or no, to give a Being to another, and not &s;o as Men, who engender not, but according to their Whim&s;eys; and who, during their whole life, cannot procreate above a Score; whereas Cabbages can produce many Thou&s;ands a Head. Yet the Opi|nion that Nature is kinder to Mankind, than to Cabbage-kind, tickles and makes us laugh: But &s;eeing &s;he is incapable of Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he can neither love, nor hate any thing; and were &s;he &s;u&s;ceptible of Love, &s;he would rather be&s;tow her af|fection upon this Cabbage, which you grant cannot offend her, than upon that Man who would de&s;troy her, if it lay in his power. And moreover, Man can|not be born Innocent, being a Part of the fir&s;t Offendor: But we know very well, that the fir&s;t Cabbage did not of|fend its Creator. If it be &s;aid, that we
<PB N="95" REF="50"> are made after the Image of the Su|preme Being, and &s;o is not the Cabbage; grant that to be true; yet by polluting our Soul, wherein we re&s;embled Him, we have effaced that Likene&s;s, &s;eeing no|thing is more contrary to God than Sin. If then our Soul be no longer his Image, we re&s;emble him no more in our Feet, Hands, Mouth, Forehead and Ears, than a Cabbage in its Leaves, Flowers, Stalk, Pith, and Head: Do not you really think, that if this poor Plant could &s;peak, when one cuts it, it would not &s;ay, Dear Bro|ther Man, what have I done to thee that de&s;erves Death? I never grow but in Gardens, and am never to be found in de&s;art places, where I might live in Security: I di&s;dain all other company but thine; and &s;carcely am I &s;owed in thy Garden, when to &s;hew thee my Good|will, I blow, &s;tretch out my Arms to thee; offer thee my Children in Grain; and as a requital for my civility, thou cau&s;e&s;t my Head to be chopt off. Thus would a Cabbage di&s;cour&s;e, if it could &s;peak. Well, and becau&s;e it cannot com|plain, may we therefore ju&s;tly do it all the Wrong which it cannot hinder? If I find a Wretch bound Hand and Foot, may I lawfully kill him, becau&s;e he can|not
<PB N="96" REF="51"> defend him&s;elf; &s;o far from that, that his Weakne&s;s would aggravate my Cruelty? And though this wretched Crea|ture be poor, and de&s;titute of all the ad|vantages which we have, yet it de&s;erves not Death; and when of all the Benefits of a Being, it hath only that of Encrea&s;e, we ought not cruelly to &s;natch that away from it. To ma&s;&s;acre a Man, is not &s;o great Sin, as to cut and kill a Cabbage, becau&s;e one day the Man will ri&s;e again, but the Cabbage has no other Life to hope for: By putting to death a Cab|bage, you annihilate it; but in killing a Man, you make him only change his Habitation: Nay, I'll go farther with you &s;till, &s;ince God doth equally cheri&s;h all his Works, and hath equally divided his Benefits betwixt Us, and Plants, it is but ju&s;t we &s;hould have an equal E&s;teem for Them, as for our Selves. It is true, we were born fir&s;t, but in the Family of God there is no Birth-right. If then the Cabbage &s;hare not with us in the in|heritance of Immortality, without doubt, that Want was made up by &s;ome other Advantage, that may make amends for the &s;hort ne&s;s of its Being; may be by an univer&s;al Intellect, or a perfect Know|ledge of all things in their Cau&s;es;
<PB N="97" REF="51"> and it's for that Rea&s;on, that the wi&s;e Mov|er of all things, hath not &s;haped for it Or|gans like ours, which are proper only for a &s;imple Rea&s;oning, not only weak, but ma|ny times fallacious too; but others, more ingeniou&s;ly framed, &s;tronger, and more numerous, which &s;erve to manage its Spe|culative Exerci&s;es. You'll ask me, per|haps, when ever any Cabbage, imparted tho&s;e lofty Conceptions to us? But tell me, again, who ever di&s;covered to us cer|tain Beings, which we allow to be above us; to whom, we bear no Analogy, nor Proportion, and who&s;e Exi&s;tence, it is as hard for us to comprehend, as the Under|&s;tanding and Ways, whereby a Cabbage expre&s;&s;es its &s;elf to its like, though not to us, becau&s;e our Sen&s;es are too dull to pene|trate &s;o far.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the greate&s;t of Philo&s;ophers, who drew the Knowledge of Nature, from the Fountain-Head, Nature her &s;elf, hinted this truth to us, when he &s;poke of the Tree of Knowledge; and without doubt, he intended to intimate to us, under that Figure, that Plants, in Exclu&s;ion to Man|kind, po&s;&s;e&s;s perfect Philo&s;ophy. Remem|ber, then, O thou Proude&s;t of Animals I that though a Cabbage which thou cutte&s;t, &s;ayeth not a Word, yet it pays it at Think|ing; but the poor Vegetable, has no fit

And that &s;ome among&s;t them, when they &s;hut up at Night, may not Compliment one another, as you do, &s;aying: Good Night, Ma&s;ter

<P>So far was he gone on in his Di&s;cour&s;e, when the young Lad, who had led out our Philo&s;opher, led him in again; What, Supped already? cryed my Spirit to him.

Our young Landlord &s;tay|ed not, till I &s;hould ask him the meaning of that My&s;tery; I perceive, &s;aid he, you wonder at this way of Living; know then, that in your World, the Govern|ment of Health is too much neglected, and that our Method is not to be de|&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="52"> In all Hou&s;es, there is a Phy&s;iognomi&s;t entertained by the Publick, who in &s;ome manner, re&s;embles your Phy&s;icians, &s;ave that he only pre&s;cribes to the Healthful, and judges of the different manner, how we are to be Treated, only according to the Proportion, Figure, and Symetry of our Members; by the Features of the Face, the Complexion, the Softne&s;s of the Skin, the Agility of the Body, the Sound of the Voice, and the Colour, Strength, and Hardne&s;s of the Hair.

During all this Di&s;cour&s;e, I made Signs to my Landlord, that he would try, if he could oblige the Philo&s;ophers, to fall upon &s;ome head of the Science, which they profe&s;&s;ed. He was
<PB N="100" REF="53"> too much my Friend, not to &s;tart an Oc|ca&s;ion upon the Spot: But not to trou|ble the Reader, with the Di&s;cour&s;e, and Entreaties, that were previous to the Treaty, wherein Je&s;t and Earne&s;t were &s;o wittily interwoven, that it can hardly be imitated; I'll only tell you, that the Doctor, who came la&s;t, after many things, &s;pake as follows:</P>
<P>It remains to be proved, that there are infinite Worlds, in an infinite World: Fancy to your &s;elf then the Univer&s;e, as a great Animal, and that the Stars, which are Worlds, are in this great Animal, as other great Animals, that &s;erve recipro|cally for Worlds to other People. Such as we, our Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That we in our turns, are likewi&s;e Worlds to certain other Animals, incomparably le&s;s than our &s;elves, &s;uch as Nits, Lice, Hand-worms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that the&s;e are on Earth, to others more imperceptible ones; in the &s;ame manner, as every one of us, appears to be a great World, to the&s;e little People. Perhaps, our Fle&s;h, Blood, and Spirits, are nothing el&s;e, but a Contexture of little Animals that corre&s;pond, lend us Motion from theirs, and blindly &s;uffer them&s;elves to be guided by our Will, which is their Coach|man; or otherwi&s;e conduct us, and all Con&s;piring together, produce that Action
<PB N="101" REF="53"> which we call Life. For tell me, pray, is it a hard thing to be believed, that a Lou&s;e takes your Body for a World; and that when any one of them, travels from one of your Ears to the other, his Companions &s;ay, that he hath travelled the Earth, from end to end, or that he hath run from one Pole to the other? Yes, without doubt, tho&s;e little People, take your Hair for the Fore&s;ts of their Country; the Pores full of Liquor, for Fountains; Buboes and Pim|ples, for Lakes and Ponds; Boils, for Seas; and Defluxions, for Deluges: And when you Comb your &s;elf, forwards, and back|wards, they take that Agitation, for the Flowing and Ebbing of the Ocean. Doth not Itching make good what I &s;ay? What is the little Worm that cau&s;es it, but one of the&s;e little Animals, which hath broken off from civil Society, that it may &s;et up for a Tyrant in its Country? If you ask me, why are they bigger than other im|perceptible Creatures? I ask you, why are Elephants bigger than we? And the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-men, than <HI>Spaniards?</HI> As to the Bli|&s;ters, and Scurff, which you know not the Cau&s;e of; they mu&s;t either happen by the Corruption of their Enemies, which the&s;e little Blades have killed, or which the Plague has cau&s;ed by the &s;carcity of Food, for which the Seditious wor|ried
<PB N="102" REF="54"> one another, and left Mountains of Dead Carca&s;es rotting in the Field; or becau&s;e the Tyrant, having driven away on all Hands his Companions, who by their Bodies, &s;topt up the Pores of ours, hath made way out for the wateri&s;h Matter, which being extrava&s;ated, and out of the Sphere of the Circulation of our Blood, is corrupted. It may be asked, perhaps, why a Nit, or Hand-worm, produces &s;o many di&s;orders? But that's ea&s;ily conceived; for as one Revolt begets another, &s;o the&s;e little People, egg'd on by the bad Example of their Seditious Companions, a&s;pire &s;everal|ly to Soveraign Command; and occa&s;ion every where, War, Slaughter, and Famine. But you'll &s;ay, &s;ome are far le&s;s &s;ubject to Itching, than others; and, neverthele&s;s, all are equally inhabited by the&s;e little Ani|mals, &s;ince you &s;ay, they are the Cau&s;e of our Life. That's true; for we ob&s;erve, that Phlegmatick People, are not &s;o much given to &s;cratching as the Cholerick; be|cau&s;e the People &s;ympathizing with the Climate they inhabit, are &s;lower in a cold Body, than tho&s;e others that are heated by the temper of their Region, who frisk and &s;tir, and cannot re&s;t in a place: Thus a Cholerick Man, is more delicate than a Phlegmatick; becau&s;e being animated in many more Parts, and the Soul, being

<PB N="103" REF="54"> Action of the&s;e little Bea&s;ts, he is capable of Feeling, in all places where tho&s;e Cat|tle &s;tir. Whereas, the Phlegmatick Man, wanting &s;ufficient Heat to put that &s;tir|ring Mobile in Action, is &s;en&s;ible but in a few places; and to prove more plain|ly that univer&s;al
<HI>Vermicularity,</HI> you need but con&s;ider, when you are wounded, how the Blood runs to the Sore: Your Doctors &s;ay, that it is guided by provi|dent Nature, who would &s;uccour the parts debilitated; which might make us conclude, that, be&s;ides the Soul and Mind, there were a third intellectual Sub&s;tance, that had di&s;tinct Organs and Functions: And therefore, it &s;eems to me far more Rational, to &s;ay, That the&s;e little Animals, finding them&s;elves attacked, &s;end to de|mand A&s;&s;i&s;tance from their Neighbours, and that Recruits flocking in from all Parts, and the Country being too little to contain &s;o many, they either die of Hunger, or are &s;tifled in the Pre&s;s. That Mortality hap|pens when the Boil is ripe; for as an Ar|gument, that the&s;e Animals at that time are &s;tifled, the Fle&s;h becomes in&s;en&s;ible: Now, if Blood-letting, which is many times ordered to divert the Fluxion, do any good, it is becau&s;e, much being lo&s;t by the Orifice, which the&s;e little Animals laboured to &s;top, they refu&s;e their Allies

<P>Thus he concluded, and when the &s;e|cond Philo&s;opher, perceived by all our Looks, that we longed to hear him &s;peak in his turn:</P>
<P>Men, &s;aid he, &s;eeing you are curious to in&s;truct this little Animal, (our like) in &s;omewhat of the Science which we pro|fe&s;s, I am now dictating a Treati&s;e, which I wi&s;h he might &s;ee, becau&s;e of the Light it gives to the Under&s;tanding of our Na|tural Philo&s;ophy; it is an Explication of the Original of the World: But &s;eeing I am in ha&s;te to &s;et my Bellows at work, (for to Morrow, without delay, the Town departs;) I hope you'll excu&s;e my want of time, and I promi&s;e to &s;atisfie you, a&s;|&s;oon as the Town is arrived, at the place whither it is to go.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, the Landlord's Son cal|led his Father, to know what it was a Clock? who having an&s;wered him, that it was pa&s;t Eight, he asked him in a great Rage, Why he did not give him notice at Seven, according as he had commanded him, that he knew well enough, the Hou&s;es were to be gone to Morrow; and that the City Walls were already upon their Journey?

<P>I had much ado, though I bit my Lip, to forbear Laughing at &s;o plea&s;ant a Pu|ni&s;hment; and therefore to take me off of this odd piece of Pedantick Di&s;cipline, which, without doubt, would have made me bur&s;t out at la&s;t; I prayed my Philo&s;opher to tell me, what he meant by that Journey of the Town, he talked of, and if the Hou&s;es and Walls Travelled? Dear Stran|ger, an&s;wered he, we have &s;ome Ambula|tory Towns, and &s;ome Sedentary; the Am|bulatory, as for in&s;tance, this wherein now we are, are Built in this manner: The Architector, as you &s;ee, builds every Pa|lace of a very light &s;ort of Timber; &s;up|ported

For tho&s;e which we call Sen|dentary, they are almo&s;t like to your Towers; &s;ave that they are of Timber, and that they have a Great and Strong Skrew, or Vice in the Middle, reaching from the Top to the Bottom; whereby they may be hoi&s;ted up, or let down as People plea&s;e. Now the Ground under|neath, is dugg as deep as the Hou&s;e is high; and it is &s;o ordered, that &s;o &s;oon as the Fro&s;ts begin to chill the Air, they may &s;ink their Hou&s;es down under Ground, where they keep them&s;elves &s;ecure from the Severity of the Weather: But a&s;&s;oon as the gentle Breathings of the Spring, begin to &s;often and qualifie the Air; they rai&s;e

I prayed him, &s;ince he had &s;hew'd me &s;o much good|ne&s;s, and that the Town was not to part till next day, that he would tell me &s;ome|what of that Original of the World, which he had mentioned not long before; and I promi&s;e you, &s;aid I, that in requital, &s;o &s;oon as I am got back to the Moon, from whence my Governour (pointing to my Spirit) will tell you that I am come, I'll &s;pread your Renown there, by relat|ing the rare things you &s;hall tell me: I perceive you Laugh at that promi&s;e, be|cau&s;e you do not believe, that the Moon, I &s;peak of, is a World, and that I am an Inhabitant of it; but I can a&s;&s;ure you al|&s;o, that the People of that World, who take this only for a Moon, will Laugh at me, when I tell them that your Moon is a World, and that there are Fields, and Inhabitants in it: He an&s;wered only with a &s;mile, and &s;pake in this manner:</P>
<P>Since in A&s;cending to the Original of this great
<HI>ALL,</HI> we are forced to run in|to three or four Ab&s;urdities; it is but rea|&s;onable we &s;hould follow the way, where|in we may be lea&s;t apt to &s;tumble. I &s;ay then, that the fir&s;t Ob&s;tacle that &s;tops us &s;hort, is the Eternity of the World; and the minds of men, not being able enough to
<PB N="108" REF="57"> conceive it, and being no more able to ima|gine, that this great Univer&s;e, &s;o lovely and &s;o well ordered, could have made it &s;elf, they have had their recour&s;e to Creati|on: But like to him that would leap into a River, for fear of being wet with Rain, they &s;ave them&s;elves out of the Clutches of a Dwarf, by running into the Arms of a Giant; and yet they are not &s;afe for all that: For that Eternity which they deny the World, becau&s;e they cannot compre|hend it, they attribute it to God, as if he &s;tood in need of that Pre&s;ent, and as if it were ea&s;ier to imagine it, in the one than in the other; for tell me, pray, was it e|ver yet conceived in Nature, how Some|thing can be made of Nothing? Alas! betwixt Nothing and an Atome only, there are &s;uch infinite Di&s;proportions, that the &s;harpe&s;t Wit could never dive into them; therefore to get out of this inextricable La|byrinth, you mu&s;t admit of a Matter Eter|nal with God: But you'l &s;ay to me, grant I &s;hould allow you that Eternal Matter; how could that Chaos di&s;po&s;e and order it &s;elf? That's the thing I am about to ex|plain to you.</P>
<P>My little Animal, after you have men|tally divided every little Vi&s;ible Body, in|to an infinite many little invi&s;ible Bodies; you mu&s;t imagine, That the infinite Univer&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="57"> con&s;i&s;ts only of the&s;e Atomes, which are mo&s;t &s;olid, mo&s;t incorruptible, and mo&s;t &s;imple; who&s;e Figures are partly Cubical, partly Parallelograms, partly Angular, part|ly Round, partly Sharp-pointed, partly Pyramidal, partly Six-cornered, and part|ly Oval; which act all &s;everally, accord|ing to their Various Figures: And to &s;hew that it is &s;o, put a very round Ivory Bowl upon a very &s;mooth place, and with the lea&s;t touch you give, it will be half a quarter of an hour before it re&s;t: Now I &s;ay, that if it were perfectly round, as &s;ome of the Atomes I &s;peak of are, and the Sur|face on which it is put perfectly &s;mooth, it would never re&s;t. If Art then be capable of inclining a Body to a perpetual Motion, why may we not believe that Nature can do it? It's the &s;ame with the other Fi|gures, of which the Square require a per|petual Re&s;t, others an oblique Motion, o|thers a half Motion, as Trepidation; and the Round, who&s;e Nature is to move, joyning a Pyramidal, makes that, perhaps, which we call Fire; becau&s;e not only Fire is in conti|nual Agitation, but al&s;o becau&s;e it ea&s;ily penetrates: Be&s;ides, the Fire hath diffe|rent effects, according to the opening and quality of the Angles, when the round Fi|gure is joyned; for Example, The Fire of Pepper is another thing, than the Fire of
<PB N="110" REF="58"> Sugar, the Fire of Sugar differs from that of Cinnamon; that of Cinnamon, from that of the Clove; and this from the Fire of a Faggot. Now the Fire, which is the Ar|chitect of the parts and whole of the Uni|ver&s;e, hath driven together, and Congre|gated into an Oak, the quantity of Figures which are nece&s;&s;ary for the Compo&s;ition of that Oak: But you'l &s;ay, how could Ha|zard congregate into one place, all the Fi|gures that are nece&s;&s;ary for the production of that Oak? I an&s;wer, That it is no wonder that Matter &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, &s;hould form an Oak; but the wonder would have been greater, if the Matter being &s;o di&s;po&s;|ed, the Oak had not been produced, had there been a few le&s;s of &s;ome Figures, it would have been an Elm, a Poplar, a Wil|low; and fewer of 'em &s;till, it would have been the Sen&s;itive Plant, an Oy&s;ter, a Worm, a Flie, a Frog, a Sparrow, an Ape, a Man. If three Dice being flung upon a Table, there happen a Raffle of two, or all, a three, a four, and a five, or two &s;ixes, and a third in the bottom, would you &s;ay, O &s;trange! that each Die &s;hould turn up &s;uch a chance, when there were &s;o many others. A Sequence of three hath happen|ed, O &s;trange! Two &s;ixes turned up, and the bottom of the third, O &s;trange! I am &s;ure that being a man of Sen&s;e, you'l never
<PB N="111" REF="58"> make &s;uch Exclamations; for &s;ince there is but a certain quantity of Numbers upon the Dice, it's impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome of them mu&s;t turn up; and you wonder, after that, how matter &s;huffled together
<HI>Pell-Mell,</HI> as Chance plea&s;es, &s;hould make a Man, &s;eeing &s;o many things were nece&s;&s;ary for the Con|&s;truction of his Being. You know not then, that this Matter tending to the Fabrick of a Man, hath been a Million of times &s;topt in it's Progre&s;s, for forming &s;ometimes a Stone, &s;ometimes Lead, &s;ometimes Coral, &s;ome|times a Flower, &s;ometimes a Comet; and all becau&s;e of more or le&s;s Figures, that were required for the framing of a Man: So that it is no greater wonder, if among&s;t infinite Matters, which ince&s;&s;antly change and &s;tir, &s;ome have hit upon the con&s;truction of the few Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals which we &s;ee, than if in a Hundred Ca&s;ts of the Dice, one &s;hould throw a Raffle: Nay, indeed, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that in this hurling of things, nothing &s;hould be pro|duced; and yet this will be always admired by a Block-head, who little knows how &s;mall a matter, would have made it to have been o|therwi&s;e. When the great River of <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> makes a Mill to Grind, guides the Wheels of a Clock, and the Brook of

Ju&s;t &s;o it is with the Fire that moves of it &s;elf; for finding Or|gans fit for the Act of Rea&s;oning, it Rea|&s;ons; when it finds only &s;uch, as are pro|per for Sen&s;ation, it Sen&s;ates; and when &s;uch as are fit for Vegetation, it Vegetates. And to prove it is &s;o, put out but the Eyes of a Man, the Fire of who&s;e Soul makes him to &s;ee, and he will cea&s;e to &s;ee; ju&s;t as our great Clock will leave off to make the Hours, if the Movements of it be broken.</P>
<P>In fine, the&s;e Primary and indivi&s;ible Atomes, make a Circle, whereon without difficulty move the mo&s;t perplexed Difficul|ties of Natural Philo&s;ophy, not &s;o much as even the very Operation of the Sen&s;es, which no Body hitherto hath been able to conceive, but I will ea&s;ily explain by the&s;e little Bodies. Let us begin with the Sight. It de&s;erves, as being the mo&s;t incomprehen&s;i|ble, our fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="59"> It is performed then, as I imagine, when the Tunicles of the Eye, who&s;e Pores re|&s;emble tho&s;e of Gla&s;s, tran&s;mitting that fiery Du&s;t, which is called Vi&s;ual Rays, the &s;ame is &s;topt by &s;ome opacous Mat|ter, which makes it recoil; and then, meet|ing in its retreat the Image of the Object, that forced it back, and that Image, be|ing but an infinite number of little Bo|dies, exhaled in an equal Superfice, from the Object beheld; it pur&s;ues it to our Eye: You'll not fail to Object, I know, that Gla&s;s is an Opacous Body, and very Compact; and that neverthele&s;s, in&s;tead of reflecting other Bodies, it lets them pa&s;s through: But I an&s;wer, that the Pores of Gla&s;s, are &s;haped in the &s;ame Figure, as tho&s;e Atomes are which pa&s;s through it; and as a Wheat-Sieve is not proper for Sifting of Oats, nor an Oat-Sieve to Sift Wheat; &s;o a Box of Deal-Board, though it be thin, and lets a &s;ound go through it, is impene|trable to the Sight; and a piece of Chry|&s;tal, though tran&s;parent, and pervious to the Eye, is not penetrable to the Touch. I could not here forbear to interrupt him: A great Poet and Philo&s;opher of our World, &s;aid I, hath, after <HI>Epicurus</HI> and <HI>Democritus,</HI> &s;poken of the&s;e little Bodies, in the &s;ame manner almo&s;t as you do; and therefore, you don't at all &s;urpri&s;e me, by
<PB N="114" REF="60"> that Di&s;cour&s;e: Only, tell me, I pray, as you proceed, how, according to your Prin|ciples, you'll explain to me, the manner of drawing your Picture in a Looking-Gla&s;s, That's very ea&s;ie, replied he, for imagine with your &s;elf, that tho&s;e Fires of our Eyes, having pa&s;&s;ed through the Gla&s;s, and meeting behind it an Opacous Body, that reverberates them, they come back the way they went; and finding tho&s;e lit|tle Bodies, marching in equal Superfices upon the Gla&s;s, they repel them to our Eyes; and our Imagination, hotter than the other Faculties of our Soul, attracts the more &s;ubtile, wherewith it draws our Picture in little.</P>
<P>It is as ea&s;ie to conceive the Act of Hearing, and for
<HI>Brevities</HI> &s;ake, let us only con&s;ider it in the Harmony of a Lute, touched by the Hand of a Ma&s;ter. You'll ask me, How can it be, that I perceive at &s;o great a di&s;tance, a thing which I do not &s;ee? Does there a Sponge go out of my Ears, that drinks up that Mu&s;ick, and brings it back with it again? Or does the Player, beget in my Head another little Mu&s;ician, with another little Lute, who has Orders like an Eccho, to &s;ing over to me the &s;ame Airs? No; But that Miracle proceeds from this, that the String touched, &s;triking tho&s;e little Bodies, of which the
<PB N="115" REF="60"> Air is compo&s;ed, drives it gently into my Brain, with tho&s;e little Corporeal Nothings, that &s;weetly pierce into it; and according as the String is &s;tretched, the Sound is high, be|cau&s;e it more vigorou&s;ly drives the Atomes; and the Organ being thus penetrated, furni&s;heth the Fancy, wherewith to make a Repre&s;entation; if too little, then our Memory, not having as yet fini&s;hed its I|mage, we are forced to repeat the &s;ame &s;ound to it again; to the end it may take enough of Materials, which, for In&s;tance, the Mea&s;ures of a <HI>Saraband,</HI> furni&s;h it with, for fini&s;hing the Picture of that <HI>Saraband;</HI> but that Operation, is nothing near &s;o won|derful, as tho&s;e others, which by the help of the &s;ame Organ, excite us &s;ometimes to Joy, &s;ometimes to Anger.&mdash;</P>
<P>And this happens, when in that motion, the&s;e little Bodies, meet with other <HI>little</HI> Bodies within us, moving in the &s;ame manner, or who&s;e Figure, renders them &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame Agitation; for then the&s;e New-comers, &s;tir up their Landlords to move as they do; &amp; thus, when a violent Air meets with the Fire of our Blood, it inclines it to the &s;ame Mo|tion, and animates it to a Sally, which is the thing we call Heat of Courage; if the Sound be &s;ofter, and have only force enough to rai&s;e a le&s;s Flame, in greater A|gitation, by leading it along the Nerves,
<PB N="116" REF="61"> Membranes, and through the inter&s;tices of our Fle&s;h, it excites that Tickling which is called Joy: And &s;o it happens, in the Ebullition of the other Pa&s;&s;ions, according as the&s;e little Bodies, are more or le&s;s vio|lently to&s;&s;ed upon us, according to the Motion they receive, by the rencounter of other Agitations, and according as they find Di&s;po&s;itions in us for motion. So much for Hearing.</P>
<P>Now, I think the Demon&s;tration of Touching, will be every whit as ea&s;ie; if we conceive, that out of all palpable Mat|ter, there is a perpetual Emi&s;&s;ion of little Bodies, and that the more we touch them, the more evaporate; becau&s;e, we pre&s;s them out of the Subject it &s;elf, as Water out of a Sponge, when we &s;queez it. The Hard, make a report to the Organ, of their Hardne&s;s; the Soft, of their Softne&s;s; the Rough,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that this is &s;o, we are not &s;o quaint in Feeling with Hands u&s;ed to Labour, becau&s;e of the Thickne&s;s of the Skin, which being neither porous, nor animated, with difficulty tran&s;mits the Evaporations of Matter. Some, perhaps, may de&s;ire to know, where the Organ of Touching has its Re&s;idence. For my part, I think it is &s;pread over all the Surface of the Body, &s;eeing in all parts it feels: Yet I imagine, that the nearer the Member, where|with
<PB N="117" REF="61"> we touch, be to the Head, the &s;oon|er we di&s;tingui&s;h; which Experience con|vinces us of, when with &s;hut Eyes we handle any thing, for then we'll more ea|&s;ily gue&s;s what it is; and if on the contra|ry, we feel it with our hinder Feet, it will be harder for us to know it: And the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e our Skin being all over perforated, our Nerves, which are of no compacter Matter, lo&s;e by the way a great many of tho&s;e little Atomes, through the little Holes of their Contexture, before they reach the Brain, which is their Jour|neys end: It remains, that I &s;peak of the Smelling and Ta&s;ting.</P>
<P>Pray tell me, when I ta&s;te a Fruit, is it not becau&s;e the Heat of my Mouth melts it? Confe&s;s to me then, that there being Salts in a Pear, and that they being &s;epa|rated by Di&s;&s;olution, into little Bodies of a different Figure, from tho&s;e which make the Ta&s;te of an Apple; they mu&s;t needs pierce our Pallate, in a very different man|ner: Ju&s;t &s;o as the thru&s;t of a Pike, that pa&s;&s;es through me, is not like the Wound which a Pi&s;tol-Bullet makes me feel, with a &s;udden &s;tart; and as that Pi&s;tol-Bullet, makes me &s;uffer another &s;ort of Pain, than that of a Slug of Steel.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="62"> I have nothing to &s;ay, as to the Smel|ling, &s;eeing the Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves confe&s;s, that it is performed by a continu|al Emi&s;&s;ion of little Bodies.</P>
<P>Now, upon the &s;ame Principle, will I explain to you, the Creation, Harmony, and Influence of the Cele&s;tial Globes, with the immutable Variety of Mete|ors.</P>
<P>He was about to proceed; but the Old Landlord coming in, made our Philo&s;opher think of withdrawing: He brought in Chri|&s;tals full of Glow-worms, to light the Par|lour; but &s;eeing tho&s;e little fiery In&s;ects, lo&s;e much of their Light, when they are not fre&s;h gathered, the&s;e which were ten days old, had hardly any at all. My Spi|rit &s;tayed not, till the Company &s;hould complain of it, but went up to his Cham|ber, and came immediately back again, with two Bowls of Fire &s;o Sparkling, that all wondred he burnt not his Fingers. The&s;e incombu&s;tible Tapers, &s;aid he, will &s;erve us better than your Week of Worms. They are Rays of the Sun, which I have purged from their Heat; otherwi&s;e, the corro&s;ive qualities of their Fire, would have dazled, and offended your Eyes; I have fixed their Light, and inclo&s;ed it within the&s;e tran&s;parent Bowls. That ought not to afford you any great Cau&s;e of Ad|miration;
<PB N="119" REF="62"> for it is not harder for me, who am a Native of the Sun, to conden&s;e his Beams, which are the Du&s;t of that World, than it is for you, to gather the Atomes of the pulveriz'd Earth of this World. There|upon our Landlord &s;ent a Servant, to wait upon the Philo&s;ophers home, it being then Night, with a dozen Globes of Glow-worms hanging at his four Legs. As for my Preceptor, and my &s;elf, we went to re&s;t, by order of the Phi&s;iognomi&s;t. He laid me that Night in a Chamber of Vio|lets and Lillies, ordered me to be tick|led after the u&s;ual manner; and next Morn|ing about Nine a Clock, my Spirit came in, and told me, that he was come from Court, where
<GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> One of the Queens Maids of Honour had &s;ent for him, and that &s;he had enquired after me, prote&s;ting that &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her De&s;ign, to be as good as her Word; that is, that with all her Heart &s;he would follow me, if I would take her along with me to the other World; which exceedingly plea&s;ed me, &s;aid he, when I under&s;tood, that the chief Motive, which inclined her to the Voyage, was to become Chri&s;tian: And therefore, I have promi|&s;ed to forward her De&s;ign, what lies in me; and for that end, to invent a Machine, that may hold three or four, wherein you
<PB N="120" REF="63"> may mount to day, both together, if you think fit. I'll go &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et about the performance of my Undertaking; and in the mean time, to entertain you, during my Ab&s;ence, I leave you here a Book, which heretofore I brought with me from my Na|tive Countrey; the Title of it is,
<HI>The States and Empires of the Sun, with an Ad|dition of the Hi&s;tory of the Spark.</HI> I al&s;o give you this, which I e&s;teem much more, it is the great Work of the Philo&s;ophers, compo&s;ed by one of the greate&s;t Wits of the Sun. He proves in it, that all things are true, and &s;hews the way of uniting Phy&s;ically, the Truths of every Contradi|ction; as, for Example, That White is Black, and Black White; that one may be, and not be at the &s;ame time; that there may be a Mountain without a Valley; that nothing is &s;omething, and that all things that are, are not; but ob&s;erve, that he proves all the&s;e unheard-of Paradoxes, without any Captious or Sophi&s;tical Argument. When you are weary of Reading, you may Walk, or Conver&s;e with our Landlord's Son, he has a very Charming Wit; but that which I di&s;like in him is, that he is a little Athe|i&s;tical. If he chance to Scandalize you, or by any Argument &s;hake your Faith, fail not immediately to come and propo&s;e it to me, and I'll clear the Difficulties of it; any
<PB N="121" REF="63"> other, but I, would enjoin you to break Company with him; but &s;ince he is ex|treamly proud and conceited, I am certain, he would take your flight for a Defeat, and would believe your Faith to be groun|ded on no Rea&s;on, if you refu&s;ed to hear his. Having &s;aid &s;o, he left me; and no &s;ooner was his back turned, but I fell to con&s;ider attentively my Books and their Boxes, that's to &s;ay, their Covers, which &s;eemed to me to be wonderfully Rich; the one was cut of a &s;ingle Diamond, incom|parably more re&s;plendent than ours; the &s;econd looked like a prodigious great Pearl, cloven in two. My Spirit had tran&s;lated tho&s;e Books into the Language of that World; but becau&s;e I have none of their Print, I'll now explain to you the Fa&s;hion of the&s;e two Volumes.</P>
<P>As I opened the Box, <HI>I</HI> found within &s;omewhat of Metal, almo&s;t like to our Clocks, full of I know not what little Springs, and imperceptible Engines: It was a Book, indeed; but a Strange and Won|derful Book, that had neither Leaves nor Letters: In fine, it was a Book, made wholly for the Ears, and not the Eyes. So that when any Body has a mind to read in it, he winds up that Machine, with a great many little Strings; then he turns the Hand to the Chapter which he de&s;ires to hear,
<PB N="122" REF="64"> and &s;traight, as from the Mouth of a Man, or a Mu&s;ical In&s;trument, proceed all the di&s;tinct and different Sounds, which the
<HI>Lunar</HI> Grandees make u&s;e of, for expre&s;|&s;ing their Thoughts, in&s;tead of Lan|guage.</P>
<P>When I &s;ince reflected on this Miracu|lous Invention, I no longer wondred, that the Young-Men of that Country, were more knowing at Sixteen, or Eighteen years Old, than the Gray-Beards of our Climate; for knowing how to Read as &s;oon as Speak, they are never without Lectures, in their Chambers, their Walks, the Town, or Travelling; they may have in their Pockets, or at their Girdles, Thir|ty of the&s;e Books, where they need but wind up a Spring, to hear a whole Chap|ter, and &s;o more, if they have a mind to hear the Book quite through; &s;o that you ne|ver want the Company of all the great Men, Living and Dead, who entertain you with Living Voices. This Pre&s;ent employ|ed me about an hour; and then hanging them to my Ears, like a pair of Pendants, I went a Walking; but I was hardly at End of the Street, when I met a Mul|titude of People very Melancholy.</P>
<P>Four of them carried upon their Shoul|ders, a kind of a Her&s;e, covered with Black: I asked a Spectator, what that Pro|ce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="123" REF="64"> like to a Funeral in my Country, meant? He made me an&s;wer, that that naughty <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> called &s;o by the Peo|ple, becau&s;e of a knock he had received up|on the Right Knee; who being convicted of Envy and Ingratitude, died the day before; and that Twenty Years ago, the Parliament had Condemned him to die in his Bed, and then to be interred after his Death. I fell a Laughing at that An&s;wer. And he asking me, why? You amaze me, &s;aid I, that that which is counted a Ble&s;&s;ing in our World, as a long Life, a peaceable Death, and an Honourable Burial, &s;hould pa&s;s here for an exemplary Puni&s;hment. What, do you take a Burial, for a preci|ous thing then, replyed that Man? And, in good earne&s;t, can you conceive any thing more Horrid, than a Corps crawling with Worms, at the di&s;cretion of Toads, which feed on his Cheeks; the Plague it &s;elf Clothed with the Body of a Man? Good God! The very thought of having, even when I am Dead, my Face wrapt up in a Shroud, and a Pike-depth of Earth upon my Mouth, makes me I can hardly fetch breath. The Wretch whom you &s;ee carried here, be&s;ides the di&s;grace of being thrown into a Pit, hath been Condemned, to be attended by an Hundred and Fifty
<PB N="124" REF="65"> of his Friends; who are &s;trictly charged, as a Puni&s;hment for their having loved an envious and ungrateful Per&s;on, to appear with a &s;ad Countenance at his Funeral; and had it not been that the Judges took &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion of him, imputing his Crimes partly to his want of Wit, they would have been commanded to Weep there al&s;o. All are Burnt here, except Male|factors: And, indeed, it is a mo&s;t ratio|nal and decent Cu&s;tom: For we believe, that the Fire having &s;eparated the pure from the impure, the Heat by Sympathy rea&s;&s;embles the natural Heat, which made the Soul, and gives it force to mount up, till it arrive at &s;ome Star, the Country of certain people, more immaterial and intel|lectual than us; becau&s;e their Temper ought to &s;uit with, and participate of the Globe which they inhabit.</P>
<P>However, this is not our neate&s;t way of Burying neither; for when any one of our Philo&s;ophers comes to an Age, wherein he finds his Wit begin to decay, and the Ice of his years, to numm the Motions of his Soul, he invites all his Friends to a &s;umptuous Banquet; then having declared to them the Rea&s;ons, that move him to bid farewel to Nature, and the little hopes he has, of adding any thing more to his worthy Actions, they &s;hew him Favour;
<PB N="125" REF="65"> that's to &s;ay, they &s;uffer him to Dye, or otherwi&s;e are &s;evere to him, and command him to Live. When then, by plurality of Voices, they have put his Life into his own Hands, he acquaints his deare&s;t Friends with the day and place. The&s;e purge, and for Four and Twenty hours ab&s;tain from Eating; then being come to the Hou&s;e of the Sage, and having Sacrificed to the Sun, they enter the Chamber, where the generous Philo&s;opher waits for them on a Bed of State; every one embraces him, and when it comes to his turn, whom he loves be&s;t, having ki&s;&s;ed him affectionately, leaning up|on his Bo&s;om, and joyning Mouth to Mouth, with his right hand he &s;heaths a Dagger in his Heart. The Loving Friend parts not his Lips from his Friends Lips, till he find him expired; and then pulling out the Steel, and putting his Mouth clo&s;e to the Wound, he &s;ucks down his Blood, till a Second &s;ucceed him, then a Third, Fourth, and &s;o all the Company: Four or Five Hours after, every one has a Young Wench, of Sixteen or Seventeen Years of Age, brought to him; and during Three or Four days, whil&s;t they are ta&s;ting the Plea|&s;ures of Love, they &s;eed on nothing but the Fle&s;h of the Decea&s;ed, which they eat raw; to the end that if from an Hun|dred Embracements any thing Spring,
<PB N="126" REF="66"> they may be a&s;&s;ured it is their old Friend Revived.</P>
<P>I interrupted this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aying to him that told me all, That this Manner of Acting much re&s;embled the ways of &s;ome People of our World; and &s;o pur&s;ued my Walk, which was &s;o long, that when I came back, Dinner had been ready Two Hours. They asked me, why I came &s;o late? It is not my Fault, &s;aid I to the Cook, who complained: I asked what it was a Clock &s;everal times in the Street, but they made me no an&s;wer, but by opening their Mouths, &s;hutting their Teeth, and turning their Faces awry.</P>
<P>How, cried all the Company, did not you know by that, that they &s;hewed you what it was a Clock? Faith, &s;aid I, they might have held their great No&s;es in the Sun long enough, before I had un|der&s;tood what they meant. It's a Com|modity, &s;aid they, that &s;aves them the Trou|ble of a Watch; for with their Teeth they make &s;o true a Dial, that when they would tell any Body the Hour of the day, they do no more but open their Lips, and the &s;hadow of that No&s;e, falling upon their Teeth, like the Gnomon of a Sun-Dial, makes the preci&s;e time. Now that you may know the rea&s;on, why all People in this Country have great No&s;es; a&s;&s;oon as a Woman is
<PB N="127" REF="66"> brought to Bed, the Midwife carries the Child to the
<HI>Ma&s;ter of the Seminary;</HI> and exactly at the years end, the Skillful being a&s;&s;embled, if his No&s;e prove &s;horter than the &s;tanding Mea&s;ure, which an Alderman keeps, he is judged to be a <HI>Flat No&s;e,</HI> and delivered over to be gelt. You'l ask me, no doubt, the Rea&s;on of that Barbarous Cu&s;tom, and how it comes to pa&s;s, that we, among&s;t whom Virginity is a Crime, &s;hould enjoyn Continence by force; but know, that we do &s;o, becau&s;e after Thirty Ages expe|rience we have ob&s;erved, that a great No&s;e is the mark of a Witty, Courteous, A&s;&s;able, Generous and Liberal Man; and that a little No&s;e is a Sign of the contrary: Wherefore of <HI>Flat No&s;es</HI> we make Eunuchs, becau&s;e the Republick had rather have no Children at all, than Children like them. He was &s;till a &s;peaking, when I &s;aw a man come in &s;tark Naked; I pre&s;ently &s;at down and put on my Hat to &s;hew him Honour, for the&s;e are the greate&s;t Marks of Re&s;pect, that can be &s;hew'd to any in that Coun|try. The Kingdom, &s;aid he, de&s;ires you would give the Magi&s;trates notice, before you return to your own World; becau&s;e a Mathematician hath ju&s;t now undertaken before the Council, that provided when you are returned home, you would make a certain Machine, that he'l teach you how
<PB N="128" REF="67"> to do; he'l attract your Globe, and joyn it to this. Good now, (&s;aid I to my Land|lord, when the other was gone) tell me why that Me&s;&s;enger carried at his Girdle, Privy Members of Bra&s;s; a thing I have often &s;een, whil&s;t I was in my Cage, but dur&s;t not ask the Rea&s;on, becau&s;e I was always environed by the Queens Maids of Ho|nour, whom I feared to offend, if in their pre&s;ence I had talked of &s;uch a foul Subject? He made me this an&s;wer: The Females here, no more than the Males, are not &s;o ungrateful, as to blu&s;h at the &s;ight of that which Forged them; and Virgins are not a&s;hamed to love upon us, in Memory of Mother Nature, the only thing that repre|&s;ents her be&s;t. Know then, that the Scarf wherewith that Man is Honoured, and which for a Medal has the Bauble of a Man hanging at it, is the Badg of a Gen|tleman, and the Mark to di&s;tingui&s;h the Cavalier from the Clown. This &s;eemed to me, to be &s;o extravagant a Paradox, that I could not forbear Laughing. I look upon that, replyed I, to be a very extra|ordinary Cu&s;tom, for in our World, to wear a Sword is the Badg of a Gentleman. But, my dear little Man, cried my Ho&s;t without &s;tartling, what, are the great Men of your World Mad then; to make o&s;ten|tation
<PB N="129" REF="67"> of an In&s;trument, that's the mark of a Hang man, made only to de&s;troy us; and in a word, the &s;worn Enemy of all that has Life? And on the contrary, to hide a Member, without which, we had been ranked among the things that are not; the <HI>Prometheus</HI> of every Animal, and the indefatigable Repairer of the Frailties of Nature? Unhappy Country! where the Marks of Generation are Ignominious, and tho&s;e of De&s;truction Honourable: In the mean time, you call that Member the &s;hame|ful Privy-Parts, as if any thing were more Glorious, than to give Life, or any thing more di&s;graceful, than to take it away. During all this Di&s;cour&s;e, we went on with our Dinner; and as &s;oon as we ro&s;e from Table, we went to take the Air in the Garden; where taking Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the Generation, and Conception of things, he &s;aid to me, You mu&s;t know, that the Earth, converting it &s;elf into a Tree, from a Tree into a Hog, and from a Hog into a Man, is an Argument, that all things in Nature, a&s;pire to be Men; &s;ince that is the mo&s;t perfect Being, as being a Quinte&s;|&s;ence, and the be&s;t devi&s;ed Mixture in the World; which alone unites the Animal and Rational Life into one. None but a Pedant will deny me this, when we &s;ee that a Plumb-Tree, by the Heat of its Germ,
<PB N="130" REF="68"> as by a Mouth, &s;ucks in and dige&s;ts the Earth that's about it; that a Hog devours the Fruit of this Tree, and converts it into the Sub&s;tance of it &s;elf; and that a Man feeding on that Hog, reconcocts that dead Fle&s;h, unites it to him&s;elf, and makes that Animal to revive under a more Noble Spe|cies. So the Man whom you &s;ee, perhaps three&s;core years ago, was no more but a Tuft of Gra&s;s in my Garden; which is the more probable, that the Opinion of the <HI>Pythagorean Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> which &s;o many Great Men maintain, in all likelyhood has only reached us, to engage us into an En|quiry after the truth of it; as, in reality, we have found that Matter, and all that has a Vegetative or Sen&s;itive Life, when once it hath attained to the period of its Perfection, wheels about again, and de|&s;cends into its Inanity, that it may return upon the Stage, and Act the &s;ame Parts over and over. I went down extreamly &s;atisfyed to the Garden, and was beginning to rehear&s;e to my Companion, what our Ma&s;ter had taught me; when the Phy&s;iog|nomi&s;t came to conduct us to Supper, and afterwards to Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Next Morning, &s;o &s;oon as I awoke, I went to call up my Antagoni&s;t. It is, &s;aid I, acco&s;ting him, as great a Miracle to find a great Wit, like yours, buried in Sleep, as
<PB N="131" REF="68"> to &s;ee Fire, without Heat and Action: He bore with this ugly Compliment; but, (cryed he, with a Cholerick kind of Love) will you never leave the&s;e Fabulous Terms? Know, that the&s;e Names defame the Name of a Philo&s;opher; and that &s;eeing the wi&s;e Man &s;ees nothing in the World, but what he conceives, and judges may be concei|ved, he ought to abhor all tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;i|ons of Prodigies, and extraordinary Events of Nature, which Block heads have invent|ed, to excu&s;e the Weakne&s;s of their Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I thought my &s;elf then obliged in Con|&s;cience, to endeavour to undeceive him; and therefore, &s;aid I, though you be very &s;tiff and ob&s;tinate in your Opinions, yet I have plainly &s;een &s;upernatural Things hap|pen. Say you &s;o, continued he; you lit|tle know, that the force of Imagination, is able to cure all the Di&s;ea&s;es, which you at|tribute to &s;upernatural Cau&s;es, by rea&s;on of a certain natural Bal&s;am, that contains Qua|lities quite contrary to the qualities of the Di&s;ea&s;es that attack us; which happens, when our Imagination informed by Pain, &s;earches in that place for the &s;pecifick Re|medy, which it applies to the Poi&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. That's the rea&s;on, why an able Phy&s;ician <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> your World, advi&s;es the Patient to make u&s;e of an Ignorant Doctor, whom he e&s;teems
<PB N="132" REF="69"> to be very knowing, rather than of a very Skilful Phy&s;ician, whom he may imagine to be Ignorant; becau&s;e he fancies, that our Imagination labouring to recover our Health, provided it be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Remedies, is able to cure us; but that the &s;tronge&s;t Medicines are too weak, when not applied by Imagination. Do you think it &s;trange, that the fir&s;t Men of your World lived &s;o many Ages, without the lea&s;t Knowledge of Phy&s;ick? No. And what might have been the Cau&s;e of that, in your judgement; unle&s;s, their Nature was as yet in its force, and that natural Bal&s;am in vigour, before they were &s;poilt by the Drugs, wherewith Phy&s;icians con&s;ume you; it being enough then for the recovery of ones Health, ear|ne&s;tly to wi&s;h for it, and to imagine him|&s;elf cured? So that their vigorous Fancies, plunging into that vital Oyl, extracted the Elixir of it, and applying Actives to Pa&s;|&s;ives, in almo&s;t the twinkling of an Eye, they found them&s;elves as &s;ound as before: Which, notwith&s;tanding the Depravation of Nature, happens even at this day, though &s;omewhat rarely; and is by the Multitude called a Miracle: For my part, I believe not a jot on't, and have this to &s;ay for my &s;elf, that it is ea&s;ier for all the&s;e Doctors to be mi&s;taken, than that the other may not ea&s;i|ly come to pa&s;s: For I put the Que&s;tion to
<PB N="133" REF="69"> them; A Patient recovered out of a Feaver, heartily de&s;ired, during his &s;ickne&s;s, as it is like, that he might be cured, and, may be, made Vows for that effect; &s;o that of nece&s;|&s;ity he mu&s;t either have dyed, continued &s;ick, or recovered: Had he died, then would it have been &s;aid, kind Heaven hath put an end to his Pains; Nay, and that ac|cording to his Prayers, he was now cured of all Di&s;ea&s;es, prai&s;ed be the Lord: Had his Sickne&s;s continued, one would have &s;aid, he wanted Faith; but becau&s;e he is cured, it's a Miracle for&s;ooth. Is it not far more likely, that his Fancy being excited by violent De&s;ires, hath done its Duty, and wrought the Cure? For grant he hath e&s;caped, what then? mu&s;t it needs be a Mi|racle? How many have we &s;een, pray, and af|ter many &s;olemn Vows and Prote&s;tations, go to pot with all their fair Promi&s;es and Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>But, at lea&s;t, replied I, to him, if what you &s;ay of that Bal&s;am be true, it is a mark of the Rationality of our Soul; &s;eeing with|out the help of our Rea&s;on, or the Concur|rence of our Will, &s;he Acts of her &s;elf; as if being without us, &s;he applied the Active to the Pa&s;&s;ive. Now, if being &s;eparated from us &s;he is Rational, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that &s;he is Spiritual; and if you acknow|ledge her to be Spiritual, I conclude &s;he is
<PB N="134" REF="70"> immortal; &s;eeing Death happens to Ani|mals, only by the changing of Forms, of which Matter alone is capable. The Young Man at that, decently &s;itting down upon his Bed, and making me al&s;o to &s;it, di&s;cour|&s;ed, as I remember, in this manner: As for the Soul of Bea&s;ts, which is Corporeal, I do not wonder they Die; &s;eeing the be&s;t Harmony of the four Qualities may be di&s;|&s;olved, the greate&s;t force of Blood quelled, and the lovelie&s;t Proportion of Organs di&s;|concerted; but I wonder very much, that our intellectual, incorporeal, and immortal Soul, &s;hould be con&s;trained to di&s;lodge, and leave us by the &s;ame Cau&s;e, that makes an Ox to peri&s;h. Hath &s;he covenanted with our Body, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould re|ceive a prick with a Sword in the Heart, a Bullet in the Brain, or a Musket-&s;hot through the Che&s;t, &s;he &s;hould pack up and be gone;&mdash;and if that Soul were Spiritual, and of her &s;elf &s;o Rational, that being &s;epa|rated from our Ma&s;s, &s;he under&s;tood as well as when Clothed with a Body; why cannot Blind Men, born with all the fair ad|vantages of that intellectual Soul, imagine what it is to &s;ee? Is it, becau&s;e they are not as yet deprived of Sight, by the Death of all their Sen&s;es? How! I cannot then make u&s;e of my Right Hand, becau&s;e I have a Left.&mdash;And in fine, to make a ju&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="70"> compari&s;on, which will overthrow all that you have &s;aid; I &s;hall only alledge to you a Painter, who cannot work without his Pen|cil: And I'll tell you, that it is ju&s;t &s;o with the Soul, when &s;he wants the u&s;e of the Sen&s;es. O yes, but added he&mdash;In the mean time, they'l have this Soul, which can only act imperfectly, becau&s;e of the lo&s;s of one of her Tools, in the cour&s;e of Life, to be able then to work to Perfecti|on, when after our death, &s;he hath lo&s;t them all. If they tell me, over and over a|gain, that &s;he needeth not the&s;e In&s;tru|ments, for performing her Functions, I'll tell them e'en &s;o, That then all the Blind about the Streets, ought to be Whipt at a Carts-Ar&s;e, for playing the Counterfeits, in pretending not to See a bit. He would have gone on in &s;uch impertinent Argu|ments, had not I &s;topt his Mouth, by de&s;ir|ing him to forbear, as he did for fear of a quarrel; for he perceived I began to be in a heat: So that he departed, and left me admiring the People of that World, a|mong&s;t whom even the meane&s;t have Na|turally &s;o much Wit; whereas tho&s;e of ours have &s;o little, and yet &s;o dearly bought. At length my Love for my Country, took me off of the de&s;ire and thoughts I had of &s;taying there, I minded nothing now but to be gone; but I &s;aw &s;o much impo&s;&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="136" REF="71"> in the matter, that it made me quite peevi&s;h and melancholick. My Spirit ob|&s;erved it, and having asked me, What was the rea&s;on, that my Humor was &s;o much al|tered? I frankly told him the Cau&s;e of my Melancholy; but he made me &s;uch fair Promi&s;es concerning my Return, that I re|lied wholly upon him. I acquainted the Council with my de&s;ign; who &s;ent for me, and made me take an Oath, that I &s;hould relate in our World, all that I had &s;een in that. My Pa&s;s ports then were expeded, and my Spirit having made nece&s;&s;ary Provi|&s;ions for &s;o long a Voyage, asked me, What part of my Country I de&s;ired to light in? I told him, that &s;ince mo&s;t of the Rich Youths of <HI>Paris,</HI> once in their life time, made a Journey to
<HI>Rome;</HI> imagining atter that, that there remained no more worth the do|ing or &s;eeing, I prayed him to be &s;o good as to let me imitate them: But withal, &s;aid I, in what Machine &s;hall we perform the Voy|age, and what Orders do you think the Mathematician, who talked t'other day of joyning this Globe to ours, will give me? As to the Mathematician, &s;aid he, let that be no hinderance to you; for he is a Man who promi&s;es much, and performs little or nothing. And as to the Machine, that's to carry you back, it &s;hall be the &s;ame which brought you to Court. How, &s;aid I, will
<PB N="137" REF="71"> the Air become as &s;olid as the Earth, to bear your &s;teps? I cannot believe that: And it is &s;trange, replied he, that you &s;hould believe, and not believe. Pray why &s;hould the Witches of your World, who march in the Air, and conduct whole Armies of Hail, Snow, Rain, and other Meteors, from one Province into another, have more Power than we? Pray have a little better opinion of me, than to think I would impo&s;e upon you. The truth is, &s;aid I, I have received &s;o many good Offices from you, as well as
<HI>Socrates,</HI> and the re&s;t, for whom you have &s;o great kindne&s;s, that I dare tru&s;t my &s;elf in your hands, as now I do, re&s;igning my &s;elf heartily up to you. I had no &s;oon|er &s;aid the word, but he ro&s;e like a Whirl-wind, and holding me between his Arms, without the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, he made me pa&s;s that va&s;t &s;pace, which A&s;tronomers reckon betwixt the Moon and us, in a day and a halfs time; which convinced me, that they tell a Lye, who &s;ay that a Mill-&s;tone would be Three Hundred Three&s;core, and I know not how many years more, in falling from Heaven, &s;ince I was &s;o &s;hort a while, in dropping down from the Globe of the Moon upon this. At length, about the beginning of the Second day, I perceived I
<PB N="138" REF="72"> was drawing near our World; &s;ince I could already di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>Africa,</HI> and both from
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> when I &s;melt Brim&s;tone, which I &s;aw &s;teaming out of a very high Mountain, that incommoded me &s;o much that I fainted away upon it. I cannot tell what befel me afterwards; but coming to my &s;elf again, I found I was among&s;t Briers on the &s;ide of a Hill, amid&s;t &s;ome Shep|herds, who &s;pake <HI>Italian.</HI> I knew not what was become of my Spirit, and I ask|ed the Shepherds if they had not &s;een him. At that word they made the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s, and looked upon me, as if I had been a Devil my &s;elf: But when I told them that I was a Chri&s;tian, and that I begg'd the Charity of them, that they would lead me to &s;ome place, where I might take a little re&s;t; they conducted me into a Village, a|bout a Mile off; where no &s;ooner was I come, but all the Dogs of the place, from the lea&s;t Cur, to the bigge&s;t Ma&s;tiff, flew upon me, and had torn me to pieces, if I had not found a Hou&s;e, wherein I &s;aved my &s;elf: But that hindered them not to con|tinue their Barking and Bawling, &s;o that the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e began to look up|on me with an Evil Eye; and really I think, as people are very apprehen&s;ive, when Accidents which they look upon to be ominous happen, that man could have
<PB N="139" REF="72"> delivered me up as a Prey to the&s;e accur&s;ed Bea&s;ts, had not I be thought my &s;elf, that that which madded them &s;o much at me, was the World from whence I came; be|cau&s;e being accu&s;tomed to bark at the Moon, they &s;melt I was come from thence, by the &s;cent of my Cloaths, which &s;tuck to me, as a Sea-&s;mell hangs about tho&s;e, who have been long on Ship-board, for &s;ometime af|ter they come a&s;hore. To Air my &s;elf then, I lay three or four hours in the Sun, upon a Terra&s;s-walk; and being afterwards come down, the Dogs, who &s;melt no more that influence which had made me their Enemy, left barking, and peaceably went to their &s;everal homes. Next day I parted for <HI>Rome,</HI> where I &s;aw the ruins of the Triumphs of &s;ome great Men, as well as of Ages: I ad|mired tho&s;e lovely Relicks; and the Repairs of &s;ome of them made by the Modern. At length, having &s;tayed there a fortnight in Company of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Cyrano</HI> my Cou&s;in, who advanced me Money for my Return, I went to <HI>Civita vecchia,</HI> and embarked in a Galley that carried me to <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> Du|ring all this Voyage, my mind run upon no|thing, but the Wonders of the la&s;t I made. At that time I began the Memoires of it; and after my return, put them into as good order, as Sickne&s;s, which confines me to Bed, would permit. But fore&s;eeing, that it will
<PB N="140" REF="73"> put an end to all my Studies, and Travels; that I may be as good as my word to the Council of that World; I have begg'd of <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Bret,</HI> my deare&s;t and mo&s;t con|&s;tant Friend, that he would publi&s;h them, with the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Republick of the Sun,</HI> that of the <HI>Spark,</HI> and &s;ome other Pieces of my Compo&s;ing, if tho&s;e who have Stolen them from us, re&s;tore them to him, as I ear|ne&s;tly adjure them to do.</P>

<P>OUR Ship at length arrived in the Harbour of
<HI>Toulon,</HI> where the Pa&s;&s;engers being immediate|ly put a&s;hore, and having thank|ed the Winds and Stars, for the Pro&s;peri|ty of our Voyage, we mutually embrac'd, and took our leave one of another. For my part, &s;eeing in the World of the Moon, whence I came, a Song goes for Money, no that I had quite forgot the u&s;e of it; the hune&s;t Ma&s;ter thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently
<PB N="2" REF="76"> paid for my pa&s;&s;age, by the Honour he had of carrying on Board a Man who had dropt from Heaven: So that nothing hindred our Progre&s;s to a Friends Hou&s;e of mine near <HI>Thoulou&s;e.</HI> I was impatient of &s;eeing him, in hopes that I might fill him with Joy, by the Relation of my Adventures. I &s;hall not trouble you with an account of all that happened to me upon the Road; I tired my &s;elf, and took re&s;t; I felt hunger and thir&s;t, and drank and eat amid&s;t a Pack of twenty or thirty Hounds, that belonged to him. Though I was much disfigured, lean and Sun-burnt, he knew me for all that; being tran&s;ported with Joy, he flew about my Neck, and having in an Exta&s;ie of Con|tent ki&s;&s;ed me above an hundred times, he pulled me into his Hou&s;e, where &s;o &s;oon as Tears had given way to Words: We live now, at length, cried he, and &s;hall live, in &s;pight of all the Accidents, wherewith Fortune hath to&s;&s;ed our Life. But, Good God! It was a fal&s;e report then, that you were burnt in <HI>Canada,</HI> in that great Fire|work, whereof you were the Inventor? And neverthele&s;s, two or three Per&s;ons of Credit, among&s;t tho&s;e who brought me the &s;ad Tidings, &s;wore to me that they had &s;een and touched that Bird of Wood, wherein you were hurried away. They told me, that it was your Misfortune to go into it
<PB N="3" REF="76"> at the very in&s;tant they put Fire to it; and that the rapid Force of the Squibs, that burnt all round it, carried you &s;o high, that the Spectators lo&s;t &s;ight of you: So that, as they prote&s;ted, you were to that degree con|&s;umed, that the Machine falling down again, very little of your A&s;hes were to befound. The&s;e A&s;hes.

<P>Now you mu&s;t know, that &s;o &s;oon as the Salt-peter was &s;pent, the impetuous force of the Fire-works being no longer able to bear up the Machine, it fell to the Ground. I &s;aw it fall; and when I thought to have tumbled down head-long with it, I was ve|ry much &s;urprized to find, that I mounted up towards the Moon. But I mu&s;t explain to you the Cau&s;e of an effect, which you may look upon as a Miracle.</P>
<P>The Day when that Accident happened, I had, becau&s;e of &s;ome brui&s;es, rubbed my Body all over with Marrow: Now the Moon being then in the Wain, at which time &s;he attracts Marrow, &s;he &s;uckt up &s;o greedily that wherewith I had anointed my Fle&s;h, e&s;pecially when my box was got a|bove the middle Region, where no Clouds in|terpo&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="77"> to weaken her Influence, that my Body followed the Attraction; and I pro|te&s;t &s;he continued to &s;uck me up &s;o long, that at length I arrived at that World, which here they call the Moon.</P>
<P>Then I told him in full all the particulars of my Voyage, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Colignac,</HI> ra|vi&s;hed to hear things &s;o extraordinary, ad|jured me to put them in Writing. I, who love Repo&s;e, declined it as long as I could, by rea&s;on of the vi&s;its that &s;uch a Publica|tion in all probability world procure me; but being out of Countenance at the Re|proach, wherewith he con&s;tantly baited me, that I made &s;light of his Entreaties; I re&s;ol|ved at length to give him that &s;atisfaction. I put Pen to Paper then, and he being more impatiently tickled with my glory, than his own; no &s;ooner had I made an end of a Sheet, but he ha&s;tened with it to
<HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> there to give it vent in the mo&s;t ingenious A&s;&s;emblies. Seeing he had the Reputation of one of the wittie&s;t Men of the Age, my Prai&s;es, of which he was the indefatigable Herald, made me known of all Men. The Engravers, without ever having &s;een me, had already engraven my Picture; and the Haw|kers &s;tunned the whole City, crying about the Streets till they were hoar&s;e again, <HI>Who'll buy the Picture of the Author of the States and Empires of the Moon.</HI> Among&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="77"> tho&s;e who read my Book, there were a great many Ignorants that were likewi&s;e medling. The&s;e that they might act the Wits of the highe&s;t flight, applauded as others did, clapt at every Word, for fear of being mi&s;taken, and ravi&s;hed with delight, cry'd, It's good! even where they under&s;tood not a tittle: But Super&s;tition di&s;guized into Remor&s;e, which hath very &s;harp Teeth under a Fool's Coat, &s;o knaw'd the Heart of them, that they cho&s;e rather to renounce the Reputation of a Philo&s;o|pher, which, indeed, was a Habit that did not at all become them, than to an&s;wer for it at the day of Judgment.</P>
<P>Here, then, is the Rever&s;e of the Medal, he's the be&s;t Man now that can retract fir&s;t. The work they had &s;o much e&s;teemed, is no more now but a Hodge-podge of ridi|culous Tales, a heap of incoherent Shreds, a Fardel of idle &s;tories, to wheadle young Children to Bed with; and &s;ome who hard|ly under&s;tood the Grammar of it, condem|ned the Author to
<HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>
<P>This cla&s;hing of Opinions betwixt the Wi&s;e-men and Fools, encrea&s;ed its Reputa|tion. Shortly afterwards Manu&s;cript-copies of it were &s;old privately; all the World, and what is out of the World al&s;o, that's to &s;ay, all from the Gentleman to the Monk, brought up the piece: nay, and the Wo|men
<PB N="6" REF="78"> came in for a &s;hare too; every Family was divided, and the Intere&s;ts of that quarrel went &s;o far, that the whole City broke into two, the <HI>Lunar</HI> and <HI>Antilunar</HI> Fa|ctions.</P>
<P>Thus was the War carried on by Skirmi&s;h|ings, when one Morning I perceived nine or ten Beards of the long Robe enter
<HI>Co|lignac</HI>'s Chamber, who pre&s;ently &s;poke to him to this purpo&s;e.

But however it be, look ye, &s;o many Moons, &s;o many Progre&s;&s;es and Voyages through the Air, are good for nothing; I &s;ay nothing at all; and betwixt you and me, (at the&s;e words he put his Mouth to the others Ear) I never knew a Sorcerer but had Commerce with the Moon.</Q> Af|ter the&s;e good Coun&s;els they held their peace; and <HI>Colignac</HI> &s;tood &s;o amazed at their Common Extravagance, that he could not &s;peak one word: Which a grave Cox|comb, who had &s;aid nothing as yet, perceiv|ing.

<HI>Colignac,</HI> at the&s;e words, though he held his &s;ides, could not hold, but bur&s;t out in|to a fit of Laughter, which did not a little offend the Gentlemen his Kin&s;men; in|&s;omuch that he had no power to make an|&s;wer to any point of their Harangue, but by haaaa's or hoooo's; which &s;o &s;candalized his worthy Relations, that they departed with &s;hame enough to carry back with them to <HI>Thoulou&s;e.</HI> When they were gone, I drew <HI>Colignac</HI> into his Clo&s;et, where &s;o &s;oon as I had &s;hut the Door, Count, &s;aid I, to him, The&s;e long-bearded Amba&s;&s;adours I don't like, they &s;eem to me to be blazing Stars; I'm afraid the noi&s;e they have made, may be the clap of the Thunder-bolt that's rea|dy to fall. Though their Accu&s;ation be ri|diculous, and, perhaps, an effect of their Stupidity: yet I &s;hall be no le&s;s a dead Man, though a dozen Men of Sen&s;e, who may &s;ee me roa&s;ted, &s;hould &s;ay that my Judges are Sots; all the Arguments they might u&s;e to prove my Innocence would not bring me to life again; and my A&s;hes would be every jot as cold in a Grave, as in the open Air. And therefore, with Submi&s;&s;ion to your better Judgment, I &s;hould joyfully con&s;ent to a Temptation which &s;ugge&s;ts to me, not to leave them any thing in this Province but my Picture: For it would make me &s;tark-&s;taring mad, to die for a thing which
<PB N="9" REF="79"> I don't believe. <HI>Colignac</HI> had hardly the Patience to hear me out. However, at fir&s;t he did but railly me; but when he &s;aw that I was in earne&s;t: Ha! s'death, cried he, before they touch a hair of your Head, I my &s;elf, my Friends, Va&s;&s;als, and all that re&s;pect me, &s;hall peri&s;h fir&s;t. My Hou&s;e cannot be Fired without Cannon; it &s;tands advantagiou&s;ly, and is well flanked: But I'm a Fool, continued he, to caution my &s;elf again&s;t the thunder of Parchment: It's &s;ometimes more to be feared, replied I, than the Thunder of the &s;econd Region of the Air.</P>
<P>From that time forward we talked of no|thing but diverting our &s;elves. One day we hunted, another we walkt and took the Air; &s;ometimes we received Vi&s;its, and &s;ometimes we rendred them: In a word we always changed our Recreations, before they became tire&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s of <HI>Cu&s;&s;an,</HI> a Man who un|der&s;tands the World, was commonly with us, and we with him; and to render the places of our abode the more agreeable by vici&s;&s;itude, we went from
<HI>Colignac</HI> to <HI>Cu&s;&s;an,</HI> and returned from <HI>Cu&s;&s;an</HI> to <HI>Colignac.</HI> The innocent Plea&s;ures which refre&s;h the Body, made but the lea&s;t part of ours. We want|ed none of tho&s;e that the mind can find in Study and Conver&s;ation; and our Libra|ries
<PB N="10" REF="80"> uniting like our minds, brought all the Learned into our Society. We mingled reading with Conver&s;ation; Conver&s;ation with good Cheer, that with Fi&s;hing, Hunt|ing, or Walking; and in a word, I may &s;ay, we injoyed our &s;elves, and whatever Nature hath produced for the Plea&s;ure of Life, and u&s;ed our Rea&s;on only to limit our De&s;ires. In the mean time, to the prejudice of my repo&s;e, my Reputation &s;pread it &s;elf in the Neighbouring Villages, nay and in the Towns and Cities of the Province; all Men being invited by the current Report, made a pretext of coming to &s;ee the Lord, that they might &s;ee the Sorcerer. When I went abroad, not only Women and Chil|dren, but the Men al&s;o &s;tared at me, as if I had been the Bea&s;t. E&s;pecially, the Pa&s;tor of <HI>Colignac,</HI> who, whether out of Malice or Ignorance, was in &s;ecret my greate&s;t Ene|my. That Man being in appearance &s;im|ple, and of a low and plain Spirit, which made him very plea&s;ant in a kind of natu|ral Bluntne&s;s, was in reality a very wicked Fellow: He was revengeful even to Fury; a Backbitter &s;omewhat more than a <HI>Norman;</HI> and &s;o great a Barretter, that the love of Wrangling and going to law was his predo|minate Pa&s;&s;ion. Having been a long time at Law with his Lord, whom he hated the more, as that he had found him firm again&s;t all
<PB N="11" REF="80"> his Attacks, he feared his Re&s;entment, and that he might avoid it, had offered to ex|change his Living: But whether he had changed his De&s;ign, or had only de&s;erred it to be revenged on <HI>Colignac</HI> in my Per&s;on, during the time that he continued in his place, he &s;trove to per&s;wade the contrary; though the frequent Journeys he made to
<HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI> gave grounds to &s;u&s;pect it. There he told a Thou&s;and ridiculous &s;tories of my Enchantments; and the Sugge&s;tions of that malicious Man, concurring with the Voice of the &s;imple and ignorant People, made my Name accur&s;ed in that place: They talk|ed no otherwi&s;e of me than of a new <HI>A|grippa;</HI> and we had Information, that a Proce&s;s was even commenced again&s;t me, at the &s;uit of the Curate, who had been Tutor to his Children. This we had Notice of from &s;everal Per&s;ons, who concerned them&s;elves in the Affairs of <HI>Colignac</HI> and the Marque&s;s. And al|though the blocki&s;h Humor of an entire Countrey, was to us a Subject of Amaze|ment and Laughter; neverthele&s;s I was &s;tartled at it in private, when I more near|ly con&s;idered, the trouble&s;ome Con&s;equen|ces that &s;uch an Error might produce. My good <HI>Genius,</HI> without doubt, gave me the Alarum; it enlightned my Rea&s;on with the&s;e noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, to let me &s;ee the Precipice in|to
<PB N="12" REF="81"> which I was ready to tumble; and not thinking it enough thus tacitely to advi&s;e me, it re&s;olved to declare more expre&s;ly in my Favors. A mo&s;t trouble&s;ome Night having &s;ucceeded one of the plea&s;ante&s;t Days that we had &s;pent at <HI>Colignac,</HI> I aro&s;e by Break of Day; and to di&s;pell the Clouds and Cares, that &s;till dulled and di&s;compo&s;ed my Mind, I went into the Garden, where Verdure, Flowers and Fruits, Art and Na|ture, charmed the Soul through the Eyes; when at the &s;ame in&s;tant I perceived the Mar|que&s;s, walking by him&s;elf, with a &s;low Pace, and pen&s;ive Countenance, in a large Alley, which divided the Garden into two. I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him, contrary to Cu&s;tom, &s;o early; that made me ha&s;ten up to him, that I might ask him the rea&s;on of it. He made me an&s;wer, that &s;ome trouble|&s;ome Dreams, wherewith he had been di&s;|ordered, was the Cau&s;e, that contrary to Cu&s;tom, he was come &s;o early to cure by Day, an Evil he had contracted in the Night. I confe&s;&s;ed to him, that a like Misfortune had hindred me from &s;leeping, and was a|bout to tell him the Particulars thereof; but ju&s;t as I was opening my Mouth, we perceived at the Corner of a railed Walk, which cro&s;&s;ed into ours,
<HI>Colignac</HI> coming in great ha&s;te. So &s;oon as he &s;aw us at a di&s;tance, Gentlemen, cried he, take here
<PB N="13" REF="81"> one who hath ju&s;t e&s;caped from the mo&s;t dreadful Vi&s;ions, that are able to turn the Brains of a mortal Man. I could hardly take time to put on my Doublet, before I came down to give you an account of my Ad|venture; but finding neither of you in your Chambers, I ha&s;tened to the Garden, &s;uppo&s;ing you might be there. The Truth is, the poor Gentleman was almo&s;t out of Breath. So &s;oon as he had taken a little Breath, we entreated him to ea&s;e him&s;elf of a matter, which, though many times ve|ry &s;light, neverthele&s;s weighs heavy. I de|&s;ign to do &s;o, replied he; but let's fir&s;t &s;it down. An Arbor of Je&s;&s;amine offered us very pat both Seats and Shade: We enter|ed it, and every one being placed, <HI>Colignae</HI> thus continued: You mu&s;t know, that af|ter two or three di&s;turbed Sleeps, I fell a|bout Day-break into a Slumber, wherein I dream'd, that my dear Gue&s;t there, was in the middle, betwixt the Marque&s;s and me, and that we embraced him &s;traightly, when a black Mon&s;ter, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of Heads, came all of a &s;udden to &s;natch him from us: Nay, I fancy'd, he was about to throw him into a great Fire, kindled hard by; for already he held him &s;u&s;pend|ed over the Flames: But a Virgin, like one of the Mu&s;es, whom they call
<HI>Euterpe,</HI> fell upon her Knees before a Lady, whom &s;he
<PB N="14" REF="82"> adjured to &s;ave him (that Lady had the Pre&s;ence and Marks which Painters u&s;e to give in repre&s;enting of Nature.) Hardly had &s;he heard out the Prayers of her Wait|ing-maid, when all amated; Alas! cried &s;he, he is one of our Friends. Immediate|ly thereupon &s;he put to her Mouth a kind of a long Pipe, like a Sackbut, and blew &s;o long through it, under the Feet of my dear Gue&s;t, that &s;he made him mount up to Heaven, and protected him from the Cruelties of the Mon&s;ter with an hundred Heads. I fancy'd that I cried a long time after him, and adjur'd him not to be gone without me; when an infinite number of little round Angels, who called them&s;elves the Children of the Morning, carried me to the &s;ame Countrey whither he &s;eemed to fly, and &s;hewed me things which I &s;hall not relate, becau&s;e I look upon them as ri|diculous. We be&s;ought him, that he would tell us them however. I imagined my &s;elf, continued he, to be in the Sun, and that the Sun was a World. I had been &s;till in the &s;ame Mi&s;take, had not the neighing of my Hor&s;e awakned me, and convinced me that I was a Bed. When the Marque&s;s perceived that <HI>Colignac</HI> had made an end: Well, then, &s;aid he, Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Dyrcona,</HI> what was your Dream? As for mine, an&s;wered I, though it be no vulgar Dream,
<PB N="15" REF="82"> yet I lay no &s;tre&s;s upon it. I am a bilious Melancholick, and that's the rea&s;on that all my life time I have dreamt of nothing but of Caves and Fire. In the prime of my Youth, I fancied in my Sleep, that I was be|come light, and took a flight up to the Clouds, that I might avoid the Rage of a Company of Murderers that pur&s;ued me; but that after a long and vigorous Attempt, &s;ome Wall always with&s;tood me, though I had &s;urmounted a great many others, at the Foot whereof, tired out with Strugling and Labour, I never failed to be &s;topt; or otherwi&s;e, if I imagined that I took my Flight right upwards, though I &s;eemed for a long time to have &s;wum in the Skies, yet I &s;till found my &s;elf near the Earth; and con|trary to all rea&s;on, though I thought my &s;elf neither weary nor heavy, yet I was &s;till within reach of my Enemies, who &s;tretch|ed forth their Hands to catch me by the Foot, and pull me to them. Since I knew any thing, I never had any other Dreams but &s;uch as this, unle&s;s la&s;t night; when having, according to my Cu&s;tom, flown a long while, and often e&s;caped from my Per&s;ecutors, I thought at length, that I lo&s;t fight of them; and that in an open and clear Sky, my Body ea&s;ed of all Heavine&s;s, I pur&s;ued my Voyage into a Palace where Light and Heat are hatched. I had, with|out
<PB N="16" REF="83"> doubt, ob&s;erved a great many other things; but that my Agitation to fly, brought me &s;o near the Beds &s;ide, that I fell upon the Floor on my naked Belly, with Eyes full open. This, Gentlemen, is the &s;hort and long of my Dream, which I only look upon as an Effect of tho&s;e two Qualities, that are predominant in my Con&s;titution: for though this be a little different from tho&s;e which I commonly have, in that I flew up to Heaven without falling back; yet I only a&s;cribe that Alteration to my Blood, dilated by the Plea&s;ures of our Ye|&s;terday's Diver&s;ions, which hath di&s;&s;ipated my Melancholy; and by buoying of it up, cleared it from that Weightine&s;s which made me tumble down again: But after all, that's a very conjectural Science. I' Faith, continued <HI>Cu&s;&s;an,</HI> you are in the right on't, it's a Hodge-podge of all the things we have thought on when awake, a mon&s;trous Chi|mera, a Mu&s;ter of confu&s;ed Idea's, which the Fancy, that during Sleep, is not gui|ded by Rea&s;on, pre&s;ents to us, without Order; out of which neverthele&s;s we think to &s;queeze the true Meaning, and draw from Dreams, as from Oracles, the Know|ledge of things future; but I vow, I could never find any other Conformity betwixt them; but that Dreams, like Oracles, can|not be under&s;tood: However, judge of
<PB N="17" REF="83"> the worth of all the re&s;t, by mine which is not at all extraordinary. I dreamt that I was very &s;ad, and that I met with
<HI>Dyrcona</HI> in all places, who called for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But without beating my Brains any more, about the Explication of the&s;e dark Riddles, I'll tell ye their My&s;tical Sen&s;e in two Words; and that's, in troth, that our Dreams at <HI>Colignac</HI> are very bad, and that if you'll take my Advice, we'll go and have better at <HI>Cu&s;&s;an.</HI> Let's go, then, &s;aid the Count to me, &s;ince this Man is &s;o unea&s;ie here. We re&s;olved to be gone the &s;ame day; and I prayed them to &s;et out before, becau&s;e I was willing, &s;eeing (as they had agreed upon it) we were to be there a Month, to have &s;ome Books carried along with me: They conde&s;cended, and imme|diately after Break-fa&s;t got on Hor&s;e-back. In the mean time, I packed up &s;ome Vo|lumes, which I imagined not to be in the Library of
<HI>Cu&s;&s;an,</HI> put them upon a Mule, and about three in the Afternoon &s;et out upon a very good Pad. However, I went but a Foot-pace, that I might attend my little Library, and at more lei&s;ure enrich my mind with the Liberalities of my &s;ight. But li&s;ten to an Adventure, that will certain|ly &s;urpri&s;e you.</P>
<P>I was got forwards on my Journey above four Leagues, when I found my &s;elf in a
<PB N="18" REF="84"> Country which I was certain I had &s;een &s;omewhere el&s;e before: The truth is, I &s;ol|licited my Memory &s;o much to tell me, how I came to know that Landskip, that the pre|&s;ence of the Objects, reviving pa&s;t Images, I remembred that that was exactly the place, which the Night before I had &s;een in a Dream. That odd rencounter would have bu&s;ied my thoughts longer than it did, had I not been diverted by a &s;trange Appariti|on. A Spirit, (at lea&s;t I took it for one) meeting me in the middle of the way, took hold of my Hor&s;e by the Bridle. This Phantome was of a prodigious Shape, and what I could gue&s;s by the little I &s;aw of his Eyes, had a &s;urly and &s;tern Look. I can|not tell, though, whether he was hand&s;ome or ugly; for a long Gown made of the Leaves of a Church plain Song-Book, co|vered him to the Fingers-ends, and his Face was hid under a thing like a Horn-Book, wherein was written the <HI>in Principio.</HI> The fir&s;t Words that the Phantome uttered, were with great amazement <HI>Satanus Diabolus, I conjure thee by the Great and Living God,</HI>&mdash;at the&s;e Words he &s;tuck, but &s;till repeating the <HI>Great and Living God,</HI> and with a wild and skared Look, ca&s;ting about for his Pa|&s;tor to blow into him the re&s;t; when he found, that to what &s;ide &s;oever he looked, his Pa&s;tor was not to be &s;een, he fell into &s;uch a dreadful &s;haking Fit, that by his ex|traordinary
<PB N="19" REF="84"> chattering and diddering, one half of his Teeth dropt out, and two Thirds of the Mu&s;ick-notes, under which he lurkt, flew about like Thi&s;tle Down. He came back, however, towards me, and with a Look that &s;eemed neither &s;oft nor &s;urly, by which I perceived he was in doubt what cour&s;e was be&s;t for him to take, whether to be rough or mild: O! well then, &s;aid he, <HI>Satanus Diabolus, by the Blood I conjure thee in the Name of God, and of Ma&s;s-John, let me do my Bu&s;ine&s;s: For if thou &s;tirre&s;t either Hand or Foot; Devil take&mdash;thy Guts are out.</HI> I had a la&s;h at him with the Bridle Reins; but being almo&s;t choaked with laughter, I had little &s;trength to do any thing: Be&s;ides that, about half a hundred Country Peo|ple, came out from behind a Hedge, walk|ing upon their Knees, and tearing their Throats with <HI>Kyrie Elei&s;ons.</HI> When they were got near enough, four of the &s;tron|ge&s;t of the Rout, having fir&s;t plunged their Hands into a Holy Water-pot, which was purpo&s;ely carried by the Prie&s;t's Man, caught hold of me by the Neck. No &s;oon|er was I arre&s;ted, but in comes <HI>Ma&s;s John,</HI> who devoutly pulling out his Stole, bound me fa&s;t with it; and pre&s;ently after, a flock of Women and Children, who in &s;pight of all the Re&s;i&s;tance I could make, &s;owed me up in a great Sheet; wherein I was &s;o dex|terou&s;ly
<PB N="20" REF="85"> &s;wadled, that nothing was to be &s;een of me but the Head. In this Equipage they carried me to <HI>Thoulou&s;e;</HI> as if they had been carrying me to my Grave: By and by cried one, Had not this been done, we &s;hould have had a Famine, becau&s;e, when they met me, I was certainly going to lay a Spell upon the Corn; and then I heard another complaining, that the Scab did not begin among&s;t his Sheep, till of a <HI>Sunday,</HI> when the People were coming from <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> I clapt him on the Shoulder. But in &s;pight of all my Di&s;a&s;ters, I could hard|ly forbear to laugh, when I heard a young Country Girl, with a dreadful Tone, cry after her Sweet-heart,
<HI>alias</HI> the Phantome, who had &s;eiz'd my Hor&s;e. (For you mu&s;t know, that the Young&s;ter had got on the Back of him, and &s;purr'd him briskly, as if he had been his own already,) Wretch, bauled out his Duckling, What art blind then? Does n't &s;ee that the Magician's Hor&s;e is blacker than Coal, and that it is the Devil in Per&s;on carrying thee away to a meeting of Witches? Our Amorous Clown terrified at that, tumbled backwards over the Bea&s;ts Tail; &s;o that my Hor&s;e was &s;et at Liberty. They con&s;ulted whether or not they &s;hould &s;eize my Mule, and agreed in the Affirmative; but having unript the Pack, and at the opening of the fir&s;t Book hitting

No &s;ooner had one of the Ra&s;cals perceived it, but I heard him &s;cream out, that that was the Toad which was found in the Manger of his Cou&s;in
<HI>Dick</HI>'s Stable, when his Hor&s;es died. At that Word, they who &s;eemed to be in the greate&s;t heat, clapt their Hands in|to their Bo&s;oms or Pockets. <HI>Ma&s;s John</HI> cried with open Mouth, that they &s;hould take &s;pecial care not to touch any thing; that all the&s;e were Books of down-right Conjuring, and the Mule a <HI>Satan.</HI> The Rabble thus frightened, let the Mule depart in Peace. Neverthele&s;s, I &s;aw <HI>Joan</HI> the Par&s;on's Maid drive him towards her Ma|&s;ter's Stable, for fear he might get into the Church-yard, and there pollute the Gra&s;s of the departed.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="86"> It was full Seven of the Clock at Night, when we arrived at a Town, where for my Refre&s;hment I was dragg'd to Goal: For the Reader would not believe me, if I &s;aid that they Buried me alive in a Hole: And neverthele&s;s it is true, that with one turn I &s;urveyed the whole extent of it. In a Word, there was no Body that &s;aw me in that place, but would have taken me for a bit of Wax-Candle, lighted under a Cup|ping-Gla&s;s. At fir&s;t, when my Goaler turn|ed me into that Cave: If you give me, &s;aid I to him, this Stone Garment for a Doublet, it is too big; but if it be for a Tomb, it's too little. The days here are only to be reckoned by Nights; of my five Sen&s;es, I retain only the u&s;e of two, Smelling and Feeling; the one, to make me &s;en&s;ible of the &s;tink of my Pri&s;on; and the other, to render it palpable to me. In reality, I pro|te&s;t to you, I &s;hould think I were damned, if I knew not that no Innocent Per&s;on goes to Hell.</P>
<P>At that word Innocent, the Goaler bur&s;t out into Laughter. Nay, Faith, &s;aid he, you are one of our right Birds then, for I never yet kept any under my Key, but &s;uch Gentlemen as the&s;e. After &s;ome other Compliments of that Nature; the good Man took the pains to &s;earch me, I know not on what de&s;ign; but becau&s;e of the Dili|gence
<PB N="23" REF="86"> he u&s;ed, I conjecture it was for what I had. The pains he took in &s;earching be|ing all in vain, becau&s;e during the Battel of
<HI>Diabolus,</HI> I had conveyed my Gold into my Stockings; when after a mo&s;t exact A|natomy, he found his hands as empty as be|fore; both of us were within an Ace of Death, I for fear, and he for grief. S'ounds, cried he, foaming at the Mouth, at fir&s;t &s;ight I knew he was a Sorcerer, he's as poor as the Devil. Go, go, Comrade, continu|ed he, mind the Affairs of your Con&s;cience in time. He had no &s;ooner &s;aid &s;o, but that I heard the knell of a bunch of Keys, among&s;t which, he lookt for tho&s;e of my Dungeon. His back was turned; and therefore for fear he might take his revenge for the misfortune of his Vi&s;it, I cunningly pull'd three Pi&s;toles out of their Ne&s;t, &s;ay|ing to him, Ma&s;ter Hou&s;e-keeper, there's a Pi&s;tole, pray &s;end me a bit of &s;omewhat, for I have not eat the&s;e eleven hours pa&s;t. He took it very favorably, and prote&s;ted he was troubled at my Misfortune. When I perceived he was a little mollified; come, here's another, continued I, as an Acknow|ledgment of the Trouble, I am a&s;hamed to give you: At once he opened his Ear, Heart, and Hand; and I added, making them up three, in&s;tead of two, that by the third I begg'd of him to let one of his Men come
<PB N="24" REF="87"> and keep me Company, becau&s;e the unfor|tunate ought to dread Solitude.</P>
<P>Being ravi&s;hed at my Prodigalities, he promi&s;ed me all things, embraced my Legs, railed again&s;t the Ju&s;tice; told me, that he well perceived I had Enemies, but that I &s;hould come off with Honour: that I &s;hould take good Heart; and that in the mean time, he engaged him&s;elf before three days were over, to have my Cuffs wa&s;ht for me. I thanked him very &s;eriou&s;ly for his Courte|&s;ie; and my dear Friend having hung about my Neck, till he had almo&s;t &s;trangled me, went his way, bolting and double bolting the Door.</P>
<P>I remained alone, and very Melancholick, lying round upon a little old Straw, redu|ced almo&s;t into Du&s;t. However, it was not yet &s;o &s;mall, but that above half a hun|dred Rats were &s;till a grinding of it. The Vault, Walls, and Floor, were made up of &s;ix Grave-Stones, that having Death over, under and about me, I might not que&s;ti|on my Enterrment. The cold Slime of Snails, and the roapy Venom of Toads, dropt upon my Face; the Fleas there had Teeth longer than their Bodies; I found my &s;elf tormented with the Stone, which was not the le&s;s painful, becau&s;e it was Ex|ternal. In a word, I fancy that I wanted no more but a Wife, and a Pot-&s;heard to make me a real
<HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="87"> I had, however, overcome all the Hard|&s;hips of two very irk&s;om Hours, when the noi&s;e of a Gro&s;s of Keys, with the ratling of the Bolts of my Door, diverted me from minding my Pains. After the jingling noi&s;e, by a little Lamp-light, I perceived a &s;turdy Clown. He unl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ded an earthen Di&s;h be|tween my Legs: And there, there, &s;aid he, be not di&s;turbed, there's a good Cabage Soop for ye; and were it&mdash; but indeed it is my Mi&s;tre&s;s's own Soop; and faith and troth, as the &s;aying is, there is not one drop of the Fat taken off on't. Having &s;aid &s;o, he dives his four Fingers and Thumb to the ve|ry bottom of the Di&s;h, to envite me to do the like. I followed my Copy, for fear of di&s;couraging him; and he with a joyful glance of an Eye, S'diggers, cried he, you are an hone&s;t Brother. They zay you've got Ill-willers: S'lid they are Traytors; yes Dad, they are very Traytors: Well, wou'd they'd come here and &s;ee. Ay, ay, it is &s;o; he goes fir&s;t that leads the Dance. This blunt Sim|plicity brought a fit of Laughter two or three times up to my very Throat. Howe|ver I was &s;o happy as to check it: I percei|ved, that Fortune, by means of this Rogue, &s;eemed to offer me an occa&s;ion of Liberty; and therefore it extreamly concerned me to gain his Favor; for otherwi&s;e to e&s;cape, it was impo&s;&s;ible. The Architector that built
<PB N="26" REF="88" MS="y"> my Pri&s;on, having made my Entries into it, did not bethink him&s;elf of making one Out|let. The&s;e Con&s;iderations were the Cau&s;e, that to &s;ound him, I &s;pake to him to this pur|po&s;e, My good Friend, thou art a poor man, is n't that true? Alas! Sir, an&s;wered the Clown, had you been
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">th the cunning Man, you could not have hit righter. Here then, &s;aid I, take that Pi&s;tole.</P>
<P>I found his hand to &s;hake &s;o, when I put the Pi&s;tole into it, that &s;carcely could he &s;hut it. That begining &s;eemed to me to be a lit|tle ominous: However, I quickly perceiv|ed by the heartine&s;s of his Thanks, that he only trembled for Joy; and that made me go on: But wert thou a man, that would be concerned in the accompli&s;hment of a Vow which I have made, be&s;ides the Salva|tion of thy Soul, thou might'&s;t be as &s;ure of twenty Pi&s;toles, as thou art of thine own Hat: For thou mu&s;t know, that it is not as yet a full quarter of an Hour, in a word, a moment before thou came&s;t, that an Angel appeared to me, and promi&s;ed to make the Ju&s;tice of my Cau&s;e appear, provided I went to morrow to our Lady's Church of this Town, and had a Ma&s;s &s;aid at the high Altar there. I pretended to excu&s;e my &s;elf upon the account of my clo&s;e Impri&s;onment; but the Angel made An&s;wer, That a man &s;hould come, &s;ent from the Goaler, to keep me
<PB N="27" REF="88" MS="y"> company, whom I &s;hould but command in his name to carry me to Church, and bring me back again to Pri&s;on; that I &s;hould en|joyn him Secre&s;ie, and to obey without gain&s;aying, upon pain of dying within the Year; and if he que&s;tioned the Truth of what I &s;aid, I &s;hould give him this token that he had been touched for the Evil. Now the Reader mu&s;t know, that I had &s;een through a hole of his Shirt, a piece of the King's Gold, which &s;ugge&s;ted to me the whole Series of this Apparition. Yea, ve|rily then, &s;aid he, good Sir, I &s;hall even do what the Angel has commanded me; but it mu&s;t be at nine of the Clock in the Morning, becau&s;e at that time our Ma&s;ter will be at <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> about the making up of a Match betwixt his Son, and the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the la&s;t Work</HI>'s Daughter. D'ye mind me, Sir, the Hangman has a Name, as well as a Crab-lou&s;e: They talk as if &s;he &s;hould have from her Father, as many Crowns in Portion, as might make up a King's Ran&s;om. In &s;hort, &s;he is Fair and Rich; but &s;uch Wind-falls &s;eldom fall in the way of a poor Young-Man. Ala&s;s! Good Sir, &mdash; wou'd have you know&mdash;I failed not here to interrupt him; for I fore&s;aw by the begin|ing of this Digre&s;&s;ion, that I &s;hould be balt|ed by a long tale of a Tub. Our Plot be|ing very cautiou&s;ly laid betwixt us, the
<PB N="28" REF="89"> Clown took leave of me; and failed not next Morning to come at the prefixt hour, and untomb me. I left my Cloaths in the Pri&s;on, and dre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf in Rags; for lea&s;t I might be known, we had &s;o ordered it the Night before. So &s;oon as we were abroad in the open Air, I forgot not to tell him down his twenty Pi&s;toles. He looked and &s;tared upon them very wi&s;tfully. They are good Gold and of full weight, upon my Word, &s;aid I to him. Ha, Sir, replied he, that's not the thing I mind; but I'm thinking that <HI>great Ralph</HI>'s Hou&s;e is to be &s;old, with a Clo&s;e and Vineyard. I can have it for two hundred Francks, it will require eight days time to make up the Bar|gain; and I would beg of you, good Sir, if it be your Will and Plea&s;ure, &s;o to or|der the matter, that till <HI>great Ralph</HI> have told and received your Pi&s;toles, and lockt them &s;afe up in his Che&s;t, they may not turn into Shells. I could not but laugh at the &s;implicity of the Knave. In the mean time, we jogg'd on towards the Church, where at length we arrived. Shortly after high Ma&s;s began; but &s;o &s;oon as I &s;aw my Keeper ri&s;e in his turn to go to the offering, I skipped at three leaps out of the Church, and at as many more whipt into a little Bye-Street or Alley. I had a great many thoughts in my head at that in&s;tant; but that which
<PB N="29" REF="89"> I followed was to get to <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> which was but half a League di&s;tant from the place, with De&s;ign to take Po&s;t there. I got to the Suburbs in very good time; but I was &s;o a&s;hamed to be &s;tared at by all the Peo|ple that &s;aw me, that I was quite out of Countenance: That which made them &s;tare, was my Dre&s;s; for I being but a Novice in the begging Trade, had mar&s;hall'd my Clouts about me &s;o odly, that with a Gate that &s;uted not at all with my Habit, I &s;eem|ed to be one in Di&s;gui&s;e, rather than a Beg|gar; be&s;ides that, I made great ha&s;te, look|ed down, and asked nothing. At length, con&s;idering that this general Ob&s;ervation of the People threatned me with &s;ome dan|gerous I&s;&s;ue, I overcame my Ba&s;hfulne&s;s. So &s;oon as I perceived any one that lookt at me, I &s;tretched him out my Hand: Nay, I even importuned the Charity of tho&s;e that did not in the lea&s;t mind me. But re|flect a little, and wonder how many times by u&s;ing too great Circum&s;pection, about the De&s;igns wherein Fortune will have &s;ome &s;hare, we &s;poil them by provoking that haughty Godde&s;s. I make this Ob&s;er|vation, upon Occa&s;ion of the Accident that befel me; for perceiving a Man in the Dre&s;s of an ordinary Citizen, with his Back to|wards me, Sir, &s;aid I, pulling him by the Cloak, if there be any Bowels of pity&mdash;
<PB N="30" REF="90" MS="y"> I had not brought forth the word that was to come next, when the Man turned about his Head. Good God! What was he? Nay, Good God! What was I? That very Man was my Goaler; we &s;tood both ama|zed with Admiration to &s;ee one another in the place we did. His Eyes were wholly fixed on me, and I had nothing in view but him. In fine, a common Intere&s;t, though very different, recovered us out of the Ex|ta&s;ie wherein both of us were plunged. Ha! Wretch that I am, cried the Goaler, mu&s;t I then be catcht? That Word of a double meaning put into my mind the Stratagem you &s;hall hear. Stop Thief, Gentlemen, &s;top Thief, cried I, as loud as I could baul: This Rogue hath &s;tole the Jewels of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Mou&s;eaux;</HI> I have been a year in &s;earch of him. Gentlemen, continued I, all in a heat, a hundred Pi&s;toles for him that &s;hall take him. No &s;ooner had I let fly the&s;e Words, but a Troop of the Rabble fell upon the poor amaz'd Wretch. The Sur|prize that my impudence had ca&s;t him into, being heightened by the Imagination he had, that without a Body, like unto that of the Saints in Glory, which might pa&s;s entire through the Walls of my Dungeon, I could not have made my e&s;cape, &s;o tran&s;ported him, that he was for a long time be&s;ides him&s;elf. He came to him&s;elf again, how|ever,
<PB N="31" REF="90" MS="y"> at length; and the fir&s;t Words he u&s;ed to undeceive the Mobile, were, That they &s;hould have a care they did not commit a mi&s;take; that he was a man of Honour and Reputation. Without doubt he was about to di&s;cover the whole My&s;tery: But a dozen of Co&s;ter-mongers, Lackeys and Chair-men, being de&s;irous to &s;erve me for my Money, &s;topt his Mouth with Fi&s;ty-cuffs; and in as much as they fancied, that their <HI>Reward</HI> &s;hould be proportioned to the degree of In&s;olence, wherewith they in&s;ulted over the Weakne&s;s of the poor &s;tunn'd Man, every one came running in to have a touch at him, either with Hand or Foot. Here's your Man of Honour, cried the Riff-raff, and yet he could not forbear to &s;ay, &s;o &s;oon as he knew the Gentleman, that he was catcht. The Cream of the Je&s;t was, that my Goaler being in his Holy-days Cloaths, was a&s;hamed to confe&s;s him&s;elf to be the Hang-man's Church|warden; nay, he was afraid that by di&s;co|vering him&s;elf to be what he was, he might but encrea&s;e the number of his Blows. For my own part, whil&s;t the &s;cuffle was at the length I took my flight. I tru&s;ted my &s;afe|ty to my Legs, which would have &s;oon &s;et me at Liberty: But as the Devil would have it, the People beginning of new all to &s;tare at me, I found my &s;elf in as bad a pickle again as at fir&s;t. If the Spectacle
<PB N="32" REF="91" MS="y"> of an hundred Rags, which like a Brawl of little Beggars danced about me, did excite the Curiofity of any gaping Lout to &s;tare at me; I was afraid that he might read in my Fore-head, that I was one that had broken Pri&s;on. If any one pa&s;&s;ing by me, put his Hand out under his Cloak, I fancy'd him to be a Serjeant, who &s;tretched out his Arm to lay hold on me. If I ob&s;erved ano|ther &s;campering along the Streets, without ca&s;ting an Eye on me, I per&s;waded my &s;elf that he feigned not to &s;ee me, to the end he might &s;nap me behind. If I perceived a Shop-keeper enter his Shop, now, &s;aid I, he is gone to fetch out his Con&s;tables Staff. If I came into a place where there was any extraordinary Concour&s;e of People, &s;o ma|ny Men, thought I, could not be got toge|ther there without &s;ome De&s;ign. If ano|ther place was empty, here they lye in wait for me. Did I meet with a &s;top, now, thought I, they have barocado'd the Streets to &s;hut me in. In a word, Fear perverting my Rea&s;on, every Man &s;eem'd to me to be an Officer, every Word, Stop, and eve|ry noi&s;e, the in&s;upportable Rattling of the Bolts of my la&s;t Pri&s;on. Being thus be&s;et with panick Fear, I re&s;olved to play the Beggar again, that &s;o I might pa&s;s the re&s;t of the City, till I got to the Po&s;t-hou&s;e: But fearing le&s;t my Voice might betray me,
<PB N="33" REF="91" MS="y"> I thought be&s;t to Counterfeit the Dumb|man. I advanc'd then towards tho&s;e whom I pereived to Eye me. I pointed with my Finger under my Chin, then over my Mouth, and gaping made an unarticulate Cry, to give them to under&s;tand by this Action, that a poor Dumb man begg'd their Chari|ty. Sometimes I had a compa&s;&s;ionate Shrug of the Shoulders for an Alms; by and by I felt a &s;mall Bribe &s;lipt into my Fi&s;t; and anon again I could hear the good Women mutter, that perhaps I might have been in that manner Mortifyed for the Faith in <HI>Tur|key.</HI> In &s;hort, I learnt that the begging Trade is a great Book, that In&s;tructs us in the manners of People at a cheaper rate, than all the long Voyages of <HI>Columbus</HI> and <HI>Ma|gellan</HI> can.</P>
<P>That Stratagem however, could not as yet prevail over the Head-&s;trongne&s;s of my De&s;tiny, nor overcome the ill nature there|of: But what other Invention could I be|take my &s;elf unto? For to cro&s;s &s;o great a City as <HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI> is, where my Garb had made me known even to the Herring-wives, having more &s;haggy Rags dandling about me, than the erran te&s;t Tatterdemallion in the World, was it not very likely that I &s;hould immediately be taken notice of and known? And that the only charm again&s;t that danger was to per&s;onate the Beggar,
<PB N="34" REF="92"> who&s;e part is Acted under all Shapes? And then granting this Trick had not been pro|jected with all nece&s;&s;ary Circum&s;pection, I fancy &s;till that among&s;t &s;o many fatal Jun|ctures, it was a &s;ign of a very good Judg|ment, not to run &s;tark mad.</P>
<P>I was &s;etting forward on my Journey then, when all of a &s;udden I found my &s;elf obliged to turn back again; For my vene|rable Goaler, and about of a dozen of Offi|cers of his Acquaintance, who had re&s;cued him out of the Hands of the Rabble, &s;et|ting out upon the Hunt, and &s;cowring all the Town to find me, fell unluckily in my way. So &s;oon as with Eagles Eyes they per|ceived me, you may imagine, that they run, and I run, with all the Speed we could. I was &s;o nimbly pur&s;ued, that &s;ometimes my Liberty fell upon its Neek, the Breath of the Tyrants who &s;ought to oppre&s;s it: But it &s;eemed that the Air, which they pu&s;hed forwards running after me, drove me on before them. At length kind Heavens or Fear rather carried me four or five Lanes on Head of them. Then it was that my Hun|ters lo&s;t the &s;cent, and I the view and &s;hame|ful Noi&s;e of that trouble&s;ome Chace. Cer|tainly he, that hath not e&s;caped &s;uch like Agonies, I &s;peak by Experience, can hard|ly mea&s;ure the Joy wherewith I was tran|&s;ported, when I found my &s;elf out of their
<PB N="35" REF="92"> Clutches. However, &s;eeing my Safety requi|red all my skill, I re&s;olved avaritiou&s;ly to Husband the time which they &s;pent in dog|ging of me. I be&s;meared my Face, rubbed my Hair with Du&s;t, &s;tript off my Doublet, let fall my Breeches, threw my Hat in a Cellar; and then having &s;pread my Hand|kerchief upon the Street, with four little Stones on the Corners, as they do who are infected with the Plague, I laid my &s;elf down upon my Belly over again&s;t it, and with a lamentable Tone fell a Groaning mo&s;t langui&s;hingly. Hardly was I placed in this manner, when I heard the cry of the whee|zing Rabble, long before I heard the &s;ound of their Feet; but I had &s;till Judgement enough to keep my &s;elf in the &s;ame po&s;ture, in hopes that I might not be known; and I was not mi&s;taken, for all taking me for one Infected, they pa&s;&s;ed by me in great ha&s;te, &s;topping their No&s;es, and mo&s;t of them throwing a Double upon my Handker|chief.</P>
<P>The &s;torm being thus over, I &s;lipt into an Ally, put on my Cloths again, and once more tru&s;ted my &s;elf to Fortune; But I had run &s;o long that &s;he was weary of follow|ing me. No body could think otherwi&s;e; for having &s;cuddled over &s;o many publick Places and Quarters of the Town, tript a|long and turned &s;o many Streets, that lofty
<PB N="36" REF="93"> Godde&s;s, unaccu&s;tomed to march &s;o fa&s;t, to put a &s;top to my Carriere, &s;uffered me blind|ly to fall into the Hands of the Officers that pur&s;ued me. At our meeting they thun|dred out &s;o loud an Hue and Cry, that I was quite &s;tunn'd with the Noi&s;e. They thought they wanted Arms enough to hold me, and therefore employed their Teeth, not believing they had me &s;ure enough; one dragged me by the Hair, another by the Collar, whil&s;t the le&s;s pa&s;&s;ionate rifled me; and had better luck than my Goaler at the fir&s;t &s;earch, for they found the re&s;t of my Gold.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Charitable Phy&s;icians were taken up in curing the Drop&s;ie of my Pur&s;e, a great Hubbub aro&s;e; all the place re&s;oun|ed with the&s;e Words, <HI>kill, kill;</HI> and at the &s;ame time I &s;aw drawn Swords. The Gen|tlemen who dragg'd me along, cried that they were the Officers of the City Magi|&s;trates, who had a mind to take their Pri&s;o|ner from them. But take heed, &s;aid they to me, tugging me along with greater Force, that you do not fall into their Hands, for if &s;o, you'll be condemned within four and twenty Hours, and then the King cannot &s;ave you. At length, however, they them|&s;elves being afraid of the Rout, that began to come up with them, left me &s;o univer|&s;ally, that I remained all alone in the mid|dle
<PB N="37" REF="93"> of the Street, whil&s;t the Aggre&s;&s;ors in the mean time, butchered all they met with. I leave it to you to judge, whether or not I betook my &s;elf to my Heels, hav|ing cau&s;e to be equally afraid of both. In a trice I was got at a di&s;tance from the Hur|ry; but ju&s;t as I was asking the way to the Po&s;t-Hou&s;e, a torrent of People that fled from the Scuffle broke into my Street; being unable to re&s;i&s;t the Croud, I followed it; and being vexed to run &s;o long, I gain|ed at length a little dark Gate, into which I threw my &s;elf pell-mell with tho&s;e that fled. We &s;hut it upon our &s;elves; and then when we had all taken Breath: Comrades, &s;aid one of the Gang, if you'll take my ad|vice, let us pa&s;s the two Wickets, and make for the Court.

The Gnomon had marked Ten of the Clock up|on the Dial of the great Tower, before any Body came to knock at my Tomb: But about that time, when bitter Grief and Sor|row began already to pre&s;s my Heart, and di&s;compo&s;e that ju&s;t Harmony wherein con|&s;i&s;ts Life, I heard a voice that bid me take hold of the Pole that was pre&s;ented unto me. Having a long time felt about in the dark to find it, at length I met with one end thereof; with extraordinary motion I took hold on't, and my Goaler pulling the other end towards him; angled me out of the middle of that Mire. I began to &s;u&s;pect that the Countenance of my Affairs was changed, for he &s;hew'd me great Civility, &s;poke to me bare-headed, and told me that five or &s;ix Per&s;ons of Quality waited in the Court to &s;ee me. Among&s;t the re&s;t, not &s;o much as that wild Bea&s;t who &s;hut me up in the Den, which I have de&s;cribed to you, but had the Impudence to acco&s;t me, with one Knee on the Ground, having ki&s;&s;ed my Hand, he beat off a great many Snails that &s;tuck to my Hair with one of his Paws, and with the other a great clu&s;ter of Leeches, wherewith my Face was Vizor-masked.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="95"> Having performed this rare piece of Ci|vility; at lea&s;t, Good Sir, &s;aid he to me, you'll think on the Care and Pains that great
<HI>Nicolas</HI> has taken about you: S'death, d'ye mind me, when it was done for the King, it is not for you to upbraid him for it, I trow. Being madded at the Impu|dence of the Ra&s;cal, I made him a Sign that I &s;hould think on't. Through a Thou&s;and dreadful turnings, at length I came into the Light, and afterwards into the Court, where as &s;oon as I entred it, two Men caught hold on me, whom at fir&s;t I could not know, by rea&s;on they fa&s;tened about my Neck at the &s;ame time, and joined their Faces clo&s;e to mine. It was a pretty while before I could gue&s;s who they were; but the Tran&s;ports of their Friend&s;hip intermitting a little, I knew my dear <HI>Colignac,</HI> and the brave Mar|que&s;s. <HI>Colignac</HI> had his Arm in a Scarf, and
<HI>Cu&s;&s;an</HI> was the fir&s;t that came out of his Exta&s;ie. Alas! &s;aid he, we had never &s;u|&s;pected &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter, had it not been for your Hor&s;e and Mule, who that Night came to my Gate: Their Girths, Cruppers, and all were broken, and that made us pre&s;age &s;ome Misfortune was befallen you. We pre|&s;ently got on Hor&s;e-back, and had not rid two or three Leagues towards <HI>Colignac,</HI> when all the Country alarm'd at that Acci|dent, told us the particular Circum&s;tances
<PB N="42" REF="96"> thereof. We pre&s;ently gallop'd 'to the Town, where you were in Pri&s;on; but being there informed of your e&s;cape, up|on the rumor that went, that you had taken your cour&s;e towards <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> with what men we had, we po&s;ted thither in all ha&s;te. The fir&s;t man we asked news of you; told us that you were retaken, at the &s;ame time we &s;purred our Hor&s;es towards this Pri&s;on; but others a&s;&s;ured us, that you had vani&s;hed out of the Hands of the Serjeants: And as we &s;till went on, the Towns people were telling one another, how you were become invi&s;ible. At length having made further and further inquiry, we came to know that after you had been taken, lo&s;t, and retaken, I know not how many times, you were carried to Pri&s;on, in the great Tower. We way-laid your Officers, and by good-Fortune, through more apparent than real, met, attacked, beat and put them to Flight; but we could not learn, e|ven of the Wounded whom we took, what was become of you; until this Morning word was brought us, that you your &s;elf had blindly &s;ecured your &s;elf in Pri&s;on. <HI>Colig|nac</HI> is wounded in &s;everal places, but very &s;lightly. After all, we have ju&s;t now taken order, that you be lodged in the faire&s;t Chamber that's here: Seeing you love an open Air, we have cau&s;ed to be furni&s;hed

Ha! my Dear <HI>Dyr|cona,</HI> cryed the Count &s;peaking next; we were unfortunate we did not take you a|long with us, when we parted from <HI>Colignac:</HI> My Heart by an unaccountable Sadne&s;s, that I could give no rea&s;on for, pre&s;aged &s;ome terrible Di&s;a&s;ter; but it matters not, I have Friends, thou art Innocent, and let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, I know what it is to dye Gloriou&s;ly. One thing only puts me in de&s;pair. The Villain on whom I re|&s;olved to try the fir&s;t &s;troke of my Revenge, (you well conceive I &s;peak of my Curate) is now out of condition of feeling it; the wretch is dead, and I'll tell you the parti|culars of his death: He was running with his Man to drive your Hor&s;e into his Stable, when the Nagg with a fidelity heightened perhaps, by the &s;ecret notices of his In|&s;tinct, falling into a &s;udden Fury, began to win&s;e and kick; but with &s;o much rage and &s;ucce&s;s, that with three kicks of his heels he made Vacant the Benefice of that Buffle|head. Without doubt you cannot con|ceive the Rea&s;ons of that Fools hatred, but I'll di&s;cover them to you: Know then that I may trace the matter a little backward,
<PB N="44" REF="97"> that that Godly man, a <HI>Norman</HI> by Nation, and a litigious Knave by Trade, who for the Money of Pilgrims officiated in a for|&s;aken Chappel, commenced an Action of De|volution again&s;t the Curate of

<P>At the end of the fir&s;t year, he went to Law with me al&s;o, pretending that I &s;hould pay him Tythes: It was to no purpo&s;e to tell him, that time out of mind my Lands were free; he went on &s;till with his Suit, which he lo&s;t. But during the Proce&s;s, he &s;tarted &s;o many Ca&s;es, that Twenty other Suits have &s;prung from them, which now are at a &s;tand; thanks to the good Hor&s;e who&s;e Foot was harder than
<HI>Ma&s;s-Johns</HI> Head. This is all that I can conjecture of the Vertigo of our Pa&s;tor. But it's won|derful with how much fore-&s;ight he manag|ed his Rage: I am lately a&s;&s;ured, that hav|ing got into his Head the accur&s;ed de&s;ign of your Impri&s;onment, he had &s;ecretly exchang|ed his Living of
<HI>Colignac,</HI> for another Liv|ing in his own Country, whither he in|tended to retreat &s;o &s;oon as you &s;hould be taken: Nay his own Man hath &s;aid, that &s;eeing your Hor&s;e near his Stable, he had heard him mutter, That the Bea&s;t would car|ry
<PB N="45" REF="97"> him into a place, where they could not reach him.</P>
<P>After this Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Colignac</HI> admoni&s;h|ed me to mi&s;tru&s;t the Offers and Vi&s;it, that perhaps might be rendred me by a very powerful Per&s;on, whom he named; that it was by his Credit, that
<HI>Ma&s;s-John</HI> had gain|ed the Cau&s;e of Devolution; and that that Per&s;on of Quality, had &s;ollicited the Af|fair for him in recompence of the Services, which that good Prie&s;t had rendred his Son, when he bore a &s;mall Office in the Colledge. Now, continued <HI>Colignac,</HI> &s;eeing it is very hard to be at Law without Rancor, and with|out a tincture of Enmity, that remains indeli|ble in the mind; though we have been made Friends, he hath ever &s;ince &s;ought oc|ca&s;ions &s;ecretly to cro&s;s me: But it mat|ters not, I have more Relations of the long Robe than he has, and a great many Friends, or if it come to the wor&s;t, we can procure the King to interpo&s;e his Authority in the Affair.</P>
<P>When <HI>Colignac</HI> had made an end, they both endeavoured to Comfort me; but it was by &s;uch tender Te&s;timonies of Sorrow, that my own Grief was thereby encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean while my Goaler came back, and told us that the Chamber was ready. Come let's go &s;ee it, an&s;wered <HI>Cu&s;&s;an;</HI> and with that he went fir&s;t, and we followed
<PB N="46" REF="98"> him: I found it in very good Order: I want nothing, &s;aid I to them, unle&s;s it be a few Books. <HI>Colignac</HI> promi&s;ed to fend me next day, as many as I &s;hould give him a Catalogue of. When we had well con&s;i|dered and found by the height of my Tow|er, the largene&s;s of the Ditches that envi|roned it, and by all the Circum&s;tances of my Apartment, that to e&s;cape was an en|terpri&s;e above humane reach; my Friends looking on one another, and then ca&s;ting their Eyes on me, fell a weeping. But as if all of a &s;udden our Grief had &s;oftened the Anger of Heaven, an unexpected Joy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Soul; Joy brought Hope, and Hope &s;ecret Illuminations, wherewith my Rea&s;on was &s;o dazled, that with an un|voluntary Tran&s;port, which &s;eemed ridicu|lous to my &s;elf: Go, &s;aid I to them, go expect me at <HI>Colignac;</HI> I &s;hall be there with|in the&s;e three days; and &s;end me all the Mathematical In&s;truments wherewith I u&s;u|ally work: In &s;hort, you'l find in a large Box, a great many peices of Chri&s;tal cut into &s;everal Figures, be &s;ure not to forget them; however, it will be &s;ooner done, if I &s;et down what things <HI>I</HI> need in a Memo|randum.</P>
<P>They took the Note <HI>I</HI> gave them, being unable to dive into my de&s;ign; and then departed.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="98"> From the time they were gone, <HI>I</HI> did no|thing but ruminate upon the Execution of the things <HI>I</HI> had premeditated, and
<HI>I</HI> was thinking on them next day, when all that <HI>I</HI> had &s;et down in my Catalogue was brought me from them: One of <HI>Colignac</HI>'s
<HI>Valets de Chamber</HI> told me, that his Ma&s;ter had not been &s;een &s;ince the day before; and that they could not tell, what was become of him. I was not at all troubled at that Accident, becau&s;e it pre&s;ently came into my mind that po&s;&s;ibly he might be gone to Court to &s;ol|licite my Liberty: And therefore without being &s;urpri&s;ed at it, I put hand to work; for the &s;pace of eight days, I hewed, plain|ed and glewed, at length I framed the Ma|chine, that I am about to de&s;cribe to you.</P>
<P>It was a large very light Box, that &s;hut tight and clo&s;e; of about &s;ix Foot high, and three Foot Square. This Box had a hole in it below; and over the Cover, which had likewi&s;e a hole in it, I placed a Ve&s;&s;el of Chri&s;tal, bored through in the &s;ame man|ner, made in a Globular Figure, but very large, the Orifice whereof joyned exactly to and was enchaced, in the hole I had made in the head.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el was purpo&s;ely made with ma|ny Angles, and in form of an Ico&s;aedron, to the end that every Facet being convex and concave, my Boul might produce the effect of a Burning-Gla&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="99"> The Goaler, and his Turn-keys never came up to my Chamber, but they found me employed in this work; but they were not at all &s;urpri&s;ed at it, becau&s;e of the ma|ny Mechanick Knacks which they met with in my Chamber, whereof I told them I was the Inventor: Among&s;t others there was a Wind-Clock, an Artificial Eye, wherewith one might &s;ee by night; and a Sphere wherein all the Stars followed the regular motion that they have in the Heavens: By the&s;e things they were per&s;waded, that the Machine I was a making, was a Curio&s;ity of the like Nature; and be&s;ides the Money wherewith
<HI>Colignac</HI> grea&s;ed their fi&s;ts, made them go fair and &s;oft. Now it was about nine in the Morning; my Keeper was gone down, and the Skie was hazy, when I placed this Machine on the top of my Tow|er, that's to &s;ay, on the opene&s;t place of my Terra&s;s walk: It &s;hut &s;o clo&s;e, that a grain of Air could not enter it, except by the two openings; and I had placed a little ve|ry light Board within for my &s;elf to &s;it upon.</P>
<P>Things being ordered in this manner, I &s;hut my &s;elf in, and waited there almo&s;t an hour, expecting what it might plea&s;e For|tune to do with me.</P>
<P>When the Sun breaking out from under the Clouds, began to &s;hine upon my Ma|chine,
<PB N="49" REF="99"> that tran&s;parent Ico&s;aedron, which through its Facets received the Trea&s;ures of the Sun, diffu&s;ed by it's Orifice the light of them into my Cell; and &s;eeing that &s;plen|dor grew fainter, becau&s;e of the Beams that could not reach me, without many Refracti|ons, that tempered vigour of light convert|ed my Ca&s;e into a little Purple Firmament, enameled with Gold.</P>
<P>With exta&s;ie I admired the Beauty of &s;uch a mixture of Colours; when all of a &s;udden <HI>I</HI> found my Bowels to move in the &s;ame manner, as one finds them that is to&s;|&s;ed in a &s;wing.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> was about to open my Wicket, to know the cau&s;e of that emotion; but as <HI>I</HI> was &s;tretching out my Hand, through the hole of the Floor of my Box, <HI>I</HI> perceived my Tower already very low beneath me; and my little Ca&s;tle in the Air, pu&s;hing my Feet upwards, in a trice &s;hew'd me <HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI> &s;inking into the Earth. That Prodigy &s;ur|pri&s;ed me; not at all by rea&s;on of &s;o &s;ud|den a &s;oaring, but becau&s;e of that dreadful tran&s;port of Humane Rea&s;on, at the Succe&s;s of a de&s;ign, which even frightned me in the Project. The re&s;t did not at all Startle me; for <HI>I</HI> fore&s;aw very well, that the Va|cuity that would happen in the Ico&s;aedron, by rea&s;on of the Sun-beams, united by the concave Gla&s;&s;es, would, to fill up the &s;pace,
<PB N="50" REF="100"> attract a great abundance of Air, whereby my Box would be carried up; and that pro|portionably as <HI>I</HI> mounted, the ru&s;hing wind that &s;hould force it through the Hole, could not ri&s;e to the roof, but that furiou&s;ly pene|trating the Machine, it mu&s;t needs force it up on high. Though my de&s;ign was very cautiou&s;ly projected, yet <HI>I</HI> was mi&s;taken in one circum&s;tance; becau&s;e <HI>I</HI> was not confi|dent enough of my Gla&s;&s;es. <HI>I</HI> had prepared round my Box a little Sail, ea&s;ie to be turned, with a Line that pa&s;&s;ed through the Orifice of the Ve&s;&s;el; and which <HI>I</HI> held by the end; <HI>I</HI> had fancied to my &s;elf, that when <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be in the Air, <HI>I</HI> might thus make u&s;e of as much wind, as might &s;erve to convey me to <HI>Colignac:</HI> But in the twin|kling of an Eye, the Sun which beat perpen|dicularly, and obliquely upon the Burning-Gla&s;&s;es of the Ico&s;aedron, hoi&s;ted me up &s;o high, that <HI>I</HI> lo&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Thoulou&s;e.</HI> That made me let go my &s;heet, and &s;oon after <HI>I</HI> perceived through one of the Gla&s;&s;es, which <HI>I</HI> had put in the four &s;ides of the Machine, my Sail flying in the Air, and to&s;&s;ed to and fro by a Whirl-wind that had got with|in it.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> remember, that in le&s;s than an hour <HI>I</HI> was got above the Middle Region; and <HI>I</HI> &s;oon perceived it, becau&s;e
<HI>I</HI> &s;aw it hail and rain below me: It may be asked, perhaps,
<PB N="51" REF="100"> whence then came that wind (without which my Box could not mount) in a &s;tory in the Sky exempt from Meteors; but pro|vided <HI>I</HI> may have a hearing, I'll an&s;wer that Objection. <HI>I</HI> have told you, that the Sun which beat vigorou&s;ly upon my Concave Gla&s;&s;es, uniting his Rayes in the middle of the Ve&s;&s;el, by his heat drove out the Air it was full of through the upper Conduit; and that &s;o the Ve&s;&s;el being void, Nature, which abhors Vacuity, made it &s;uck in, by the opening below, other Air to fill it again: If it lo&s;t much, it regained as much; and &s;o one is not to wonder, that in a Region above the middle where the winds are,
<HI>I</HI> continued to mount up; becau&s;e the <HI>Ae|ther</HI> became wind, by the furious Rapidity wherewith it forced in to hinder a Vacui|ty, and by con&s;equence ought ince&s;&s;antly pu&s;h up my Machine.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> felt little or no Hunger, except when <HI>I</HI> pa&s;&s;ed that Middle Region of the Air; for in reality the coldne&s;s of the Climate, made me &s;ee it at a di&s;tance: I &s;ay at a di&s;tance, becau&s;e a Bottle of Spirits which <HI>I</HI> carried always about me, whereof <HI>I</HI> now and then took a dram, kept it from approaching me.</P>
<P>During the re&s;t of my Voyage, <HI>I</HI> felt not the lea&s;t touch of it; on the contrary the more <HI>I</HI> advanced towards that enflamed World, the &s;tronger <HI>I</HI> found my &s;elf. <HI>I</HI> &s;elt
<PB N="52" REF="101"> my Face to be a little hotter and more gay than ordinary; my Hands appeared to be of an agreable Vermilion Colour, and I know not what Gladne&s;s mingled with my Blood, which put me beyond my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I remember, that reflecting once on this Adventure, I rea&s;oned thus with my &s;elf. Hunger without doubt cannot reach me, becau&s;e that pain being but an In&s;tinct of Nature, which prompts Animals to repair by Nouri&s;hment, what they lo&s;e of their Sub|&s;tance: At pre&s;ent when &s;he finds, that the Sun by his pure, continual and neighbour|ing Irradiation, &s;tocks me with more na|tural Heat than I lo&s;e; &s;he gives me no more that De&s;ire, which would be u&s;ele&s;s. Ne|verthele&s;s I objected again&s;t tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, that &s;eeing the Temperament which maketh Life, con&s;i&s;ted not only in natural Heat, but al&s;o in radical Moi&s;ture, on which that heat is to feed, as the Flame in the Oyl of a Lamp: The &s;ole Rays of that vital Fire, could not make Life; unle&s;s they encoun|tered &s;ome unctuous Matter that &s;hould fix them. But I pre&s;ently overcame that dif|ficulty, when I had ob&s;erved, that in our Bodies the radical Moi&s;ture and natural Heat are but one, and the &s;elf &s;ame thing; for that which is called Moi&s;ture, whether in Animals or in the Sun, that great Soul of the World, is but a flux of Sparkles; more
<PB N="53" REF="101"> continuous becau&s;e of their Mobility; and that which we name Heat, a Concour&s;e of Atomes of Fire, which appear loo&s;er be|cau&s;e of their interruption; but though the radical Moi&s;ture and natural Heat were two di&s;tinct things, yet it is certain, that the Moi&s;ture would not be nece&s;&s;ary for living &s;o near the Sun; for &s;eeing that Hu|midity in living Creatures, &s;erves only to detain the heat, which would exhale too fa&s;t, and could not be re&s;tored &s;o &s;oon; I was in no danger of wanting it, in a Region whereof the&s;e little Bodies of Flame which con&s;titute Life, more of it was united to my Being, then &s;eparated from it.</P>
<P>There's another thing that may be wondered at; and that is, why the ap|proaches of that burning Globe con&s;umed me not, for I was already got almo&s;t with|in the full Activity of its &s;phere; but I have a rea&s;on at hand for that. To &s;peak properly, it is not the Fire it &s;elf that burns, but a gro&s;&s;er matter, to&s;&s;ed to and fro by the dart|ings out of it's moveable Nature; and that Powder of little Sparks, which I call Fire, moveable of it &s;elf, owes, po&s;&s;ibly, all it's Action to the Roundne&s;s of it's Atomes; for they tickle, warm, or burn, according to the Figure of the Bodies, which they draw along with them. So Straw &s;ends not forth &s;o burning a Flame as Wood does; Wood
<PB N="54" REF="102"> burns with le&s;s violence than Iron; and the Rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e the Fire of Iron, of Wood, and of Straw, though in it &s;elf it be the &s;ame Fire, yet it acts variou&s;ly, accor|ding to the diver&s;ity of the Bodys that it moves: And therefore in Straw, the Fire (that &s;piritual Du&s;t, as it were,) being en|tangled only with a &s;oft Body, is le&s;s corro|&s;ive: In Wood, who&s;e &s;ub&s;tance is more compact, it enters more hardly; and in I|ron, the Ma&s;s whereof is almo&s;t wholely &s;o|lid, and knit together by Angular Particles, it penetrates and con&s;umes in a trice what&s;o|ever it touches. The&s;e Ob&s;ervations being al&s;o familiar, no Body will wonder, that I approached the Sun without being burnt; &s;eeing that which burns is not the Fire, but the matter to which it is joyned, and that the Fire of the Sun, cannot be mingled with any matter. Don't we even find by ex|perience, that Joy which is a Fire, becau&s;e it only moves an A&euml;rial Blood, who&s;e &s;ub|tile Particles beat gently again&s;t the Mem|branes of our Fle&s;h, tickles and pro|duces I know not what blind Plea&s;ure; and that that Plea&s;ure, or rather that fir&s;t Progre&s;s of Pain, advances not &s;o far as to threaten the Animal with Death; but only to make him &s;en&s;ible, that De&s;ire cau&s;es a Motion in our Spirits, which we call Joy. Not but that a Feaver, though it have quite
<PB N="55" REF="102"> contrary Symptoms, is a Fire as well as Joy; but it is a Fire, wrapped up in a Body of Horned Particles, &s;uch as the <HI>Atra bilis</HI> or Melancholy, which darting out his hook|ed Points, in all parts where its movable Nature carries it, pierces, cuts, excoriates, and by that violent Agitation, produces that which is called the Heat of a Feaver; but this Concatenation of Proofs is u&s;ele&s;s; the mo&s;t vulgar Experiments are &s;ufficient to convince the ob&s;tinate. I have no time to lo&s;e, I mu&s;t look to my &s;elf: I am like <HI>Phaeton</HI> in the middle of a Career, where I cannot turn back again; and wherein if I make but one fal&s;e &s;tep, all Nature is not able to &s;ave me.</P>
<P>I perceived mo&s;t di&s;tinctly, what hereto|fore I &s;u&s;pected, when I went up to the Moon; that, indeed, it is the Earth that moves from Ea&s;t to We&s;t about the Sun, and not the Sun about it: For

Now this vici&s;&s;itude of Light and Darkne&s;s, makes it very evident, That the Planets are like the Moon and the Earth, Globes without Light, capable only to re|flect that which they borrow.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="103"> The Truth is, as <HI>I</HI> &s;till mounted, <HI>I</HI> made the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Mercury.

Mu&s;ing afterwards on the Cau&s;es of the Con&s;truction of this great Univer&s;e, I imagined that at the clearing of the <HI>Chaos,</HI> after that God had created the Matter, Bodies of the like Nature joined together, by that Principle of unaccounta|ble Love, by which we &s;ee by Experience that every thing covets its like; Particles formed after a certain Fa&s;hion a&s;&s;embled to|gether, and that made Air: Others again, to which the &s;hape gave a circular Motion, by clinging fa&s;t together, compo&s;ed the Globes that are called Stars, which not only, becau&s;e of that Inclination of whirling a|bout upon their Poles, to which their Figure determines them, ought to tru&s;s together into a Round as we &s;ee them; but ought in the &s;ame manner, as they evaporated from the Ma&s;s, and kept a Parallel March in their flight, make the le&s;&s;er Orbs, which they met in the Sphere of their Activity, to turn: And therefore
<HI>Mercury, Venus,</HI> the Earth, <HI>Mars, Jupiter,</HI> and
<HI>Saturn,</HI> have been con&s;trained to whirlegig it, and move both at once a|bout the Sun. Not but that one may ima|gine, that heretofore all tho&s;e other Globes have been Suns, &s;ince the Earth &s;till retains
<PB N="58" REF="104"> in &s;pight of its pre&s;ent Extinction, heat e|nough to make the Moon turn about it, by the circular motion of the Bodies, which are detach'd from its Ma&s;s, and that <HI>Jupiter</HI> retains enough to make four to turn: But the&s;e Suns by the length of time, have &s;u&s;tained &s;o con&s;iderable a lo&s;s of Light and Fire, by the continual Emi&s;&s;ion of the lit|tle Bodies, which make Heat and Light; that they remain no more but a cold, dark, and almo&s;t unactive <HI>Caput Mortuum.</HI> Nay, we di&s;cover that the&s;e &s;pots which are in the Sun, and were not perceived by the Anci|ents, dayly increa&s;e: Now, who can tell but that it is a Cru&s;t formed in its Superfice, it's Ma&s;s that extingui&s;hes proportionably as the Light leaves it; and if it become not, when all the&s;e moveable Bodies have aban|doned it, an ob&s;cure Body like the Earth? There are very di&s;tant Ages, beyond which there appears no Ve&s;tige of Man-kind: perhaps heretofore, the Earth was a Sun peo|pled with Animals, proportioned to the Cli|mate that produces them; and perhaps the&s;e Animals, were the <HI>Demons</HI> of whom Anti|quity relates &s;o many In&s;tances. Why not? Is it not po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e Animals after the Extinction of the Earth, have &s;till lived there for &s;ome time, and that the Alterati|on of their Globe, had not as yet de&s;troy|ed all their Race?

Is not that Sequel of time, which the Scripture ob|&s;erves, half of a Proof in a manner, that Angels inhabited the Earth before us? And that the&s;e proud Blades, who had lived in out World, whil&s;t it was a Sun, di&s;daining, perhaps, &s;ince it was extinct, to abide any longer in it, and knowing that God had pla|ced his Throne in the Sun, had the boldne&s;s to adventure to invade it? But God who re&s;olved to puni&s;h their Audacity, bani&s;h'd them even from the Earth, and created Man le&s;s perfect, but by con&s;equence le&s;s proud, to po&s;&s;e&s;s their vacant Habitations.</P>
<P>About the end of four Months Voyage, at lea&s;t as near as one can reckon, when there is no Night to di&s;tingui&s;h the Day; I came upon the Coa&s;t of one of tho&s;e little Earths that wheel about the Sun, which the Mathematicians call Spots; where by rea&s;on that Clouds interpo&s;ed, my Gla&s;&s;es now not uniting &s;o much heat, and by con&s;equence the Air not pu&s;hing my Shed with &s;o much Force, what remained of the Wind could do no more, but bear up
<PB N="60" REF="105"> my fall, and let me down upon the top of a very high Mountain, to which I gently de|&s;cended.</P>
<P>I leave it to you to con&s;ider what Joy I felt, when I &s;aw my Feet upon firm Ground, after I had &s;o long acted the part of a Fowl. Words, indeed, are too weak to expre&s;s the Exta&s;ie of Gladne&s;s I found my &s;elf in; when, at length, I perceived my Head Crowned with the Brightne&s;s of the Hea|vens. However, I was not &s;o far tran&s;por|ted yet with that Exta&s;ie, but that <HI>I</HI> thought of getting out of my Box, and of covering the Capital thereof with my Shirt before <HI>I</HI> left it; becau&s;e I was apprehen&s;ive, that if the Air becoming Serene, the Sun &s;hould again kindle my Gla&s;&s;es, as it was likely enough, I might find my Hou&s;e no more.</P>
<P>By Gullies which &s;eemed hollowed by the fall of Water,
<HI>I</HI> de&s;cended into the Plain, where becau&s;e of the thick Mud, that fatned the Earth, I had much ado to go: However, having advanced a little way,
<HI>I</HI> arrived in a great Bottom, where <HI>I</HI> rencountred a little Man &s;tark-naked, &s;it|ting and re&s;ting him&s;elf upon a Stone. <HI>I</HI> cannot call to mind whether <HI>I</HI> &s;poke to him fir&s;t, or if it was he that put the Que&s;tion to me: But it is as fre&s;h in my Memory, as if
<HI>I</HI> heard him &s;till, that he di&s;cour&s;ed to me three long Hours in a Language, which <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="105"> knew very well <HI>I</HI> had never heard before, and which hath not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance with any of the Languages in this World; notwith&s;tanding <HI>I</HI> comprehended it fa&s;ter, and more intelligibly than my Mother Tongue. He told me, when <HI>I</HI> made enqui|ry about &s;o wonderful a thing, that in Sci|ences there was a <HI>true,</HI> without which one was always far from the <HI>ea&s;ie;</HI> that the more an Idiom was di&s;tant from this <HI>truth,</HI> the more it came &s;hort of the Conception, and was le&s;s ea&s;ie to be under&s;tood. In the &s;ame manner, continued he, in Mu&s;ick one ne|ver finds this <HI>true;</HI> but that the Soul im|mediately ri&s;es, and blindly a&s;pires after it. We &s;ee it not, but we feel that Nature &s;ees it; and without being able to conceive, in what manner we are &s;wallowed up by it, it &s;till ravi&s;hes us, tho we cannot ob&s;erve where it is. It's the very &s;ame with Lan|guages; he who hits upon that verity of Letters, Words, and Order in expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, can never fall below his thought, he &s;peaks always with congruity to his Con|ception; and it is becau&s;e you are ignorant of this perfect Idiom, that you are at a &s;tand, not knowing the Order, nor the Words, which might explain what you imagine.
<HI>I</HI> told him, that the fir&s;t Man of our World, had un|doubtedly made u&s;e of that Language, be|cau&s;e the &s;everal Names which he gave to
<PB N="62" REF="106"> &s;everal things, declared their E&s;&s;ence. He interrupted me, and went on. It is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for expre&s;&s;ing all the mind conceives, but without it we cannot be under&s;tood of all. Seeing this Idiom is the In&s;tinct or Voice of Nature; it ought to be intelligible to all that live under the Juri&s;diction of Nature: And therefore if you under&s;tood it, you might Di&s;cour&s;e and Communicate all your thoughts to Bea&s;ts, and the Bea&s;ts theirs to you; becau&s;e it is the very Language of Nature, whereby &s;he makes her &s;elf to be under&s;tood by all Living Creatures.</P>
<P>Be no more &s;urpri&s;ed, then, at the faoi|lity wherewith you under&s;tand the meaning of a Language, which never &s;ounded be|fore in your Ear. When I &s;peak, your Soul finds in every Word of mine, that
<HI>Truth</HI> which it gropes after; and though her Rea&s;on under&s;tand it not, yet &s;he has Nature with her that cannot fail to under|&s;tand it.</P>
<P>Ha! without doubt, cried <HI>I,</HI> it was by the means of that Emphatick Idiom, that our fir&s;t Father heretofore conver&s;ed with Animals, and was by them under&s;tood; for &s;eeing the Dominion over all the kinds of them, was given to him, they obeyed him, becau&s;e he commanded in a Language that was known to them; and it is for
<PB N="63" REF="106"> that Rea&s;on al&s;o, that (this Original Lan|guage being lo&s;t) they come not at pre&s;ent, when they are called, as heretofore they did, &s;eeing now they do not under&s;tand us.</P>
<P>The little Man &s;eemed as if he had no mind to an&s;wer me; but re&s;uming his di&s;|cour&s;e, he was about to go on, if I had not once again interrupted him. I asked him, then, what World it was that we breathed in, if it was much inhabited; and what kind of Government they lived under? I am going, replyed he, to di&s;cover Secrets to you, which are not known in your Cli|mate.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider well the Ground whereon we go; it is not long, &s;ince it was an indige&s;t|ed di&s;orderly Ma&s;s, a Chaos of confu&s;ed Mat|ter, a black and glewy Filth, whereof the Sun had purged it &s;elf: Now after that by the force of the rays, which the Sun dart|ed again&s;t it, he mingled, pre&s;&s;ed, and compacted tho&s;e numerous Clouds of A|tomes: After, I &s;ay, that by a long and powerful Coction, he &s;eparated the more contrary, and reverted the more &s;imilary parts of this Bowl; the Ma&s;s pierced through with heat &s;weat &s;o, that it made a Deluge, which covered it above Forty days; for &s;o much Water required no le&s;s time, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll down into the more declining and lower Re|gions of our Globe.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="107"> The Liquor of the&s;e Torrents being a&s;|&s;embled, formed the Sea, which by its Salt makes it &s;till apparent, that it mu&s;t needs be a conflux of Sweat; all &s;weat being Salt. When the Waters were retired, a fat and fertile Mud remained upon the Earth: Now when the Sun &s;hone out, there aro&s;e a kind of a Tumor or Wheal, which could not, becau&s;e of the Cold, thru&s;t out its bud: It therefore received another coction; and that coction &s;till rectifying and perfecting it by a more exact mixture, it &s;ent forth a Sprout; endowed then only with Vegetati|on, but capable of Sen&s;e: But becau&s;e the Waters, which had &s;o long &s;tood upon the &s;lime, had too much chilled it, the &s;welling broke not; &s;o that the Sun recocted it once more; and after a third Dige&s;tion, that Matrix being &s;o thoroughly heated, that the Cold brought forth a Man; who hath retained in the Liver, which is the &s;eat of the vegetative Soul, and the place of the fir&s;t Concoction, the power of Growing; in the Heart, which is the &s;eat of Activity, and the place of &s;econd Concoction, the vital Power; and in the Brain, which is the &s;eat of the Intellectual, and the place of the third Concoction, the power of Rea&s;oning: Otherwi&s;e, why &s;hould we be longer in the Womb of our Mothers, than the re&s;t of Animals, unle&s;s it be that our <HI>Embryo</HI> re|ceives

It is &s;o; but in fine, &s;ome body may &s;ay, The Hor&s;e remains longer than we in the Belly of his Mother; and by con&s;equence he re|ceives there, either more perfect, or more numerous Coctions: I an&s;wer, that it fol|lows not; for, not to rely upon the Ob|&s;ervations, that &s;o many Learned men have made upon the <HI>Energy</HI> of numbers, when they prove, That all Matter being in motion, &s;ome Beings are compleated in a certain Re|volution of days, which are de&s;troyed in a|nother; nor yet to lay any great &s;tre&s;s, up|on the Arguments they deduce, from the Cau&s;e of all the&s;e motions, to prove that the number <HI>Nine</HI> is the mo&s;t perfect; I &s;hall content my &s;elf with this an&s;wer, That the Bud of man being hotter, the Sun interferes
<PB N="66" REF="108"> and compleats more Organs in the &s;pace of nine Months, than he hath rough-hew'n in a Colt during a whole year. Now it is not to be doubted, but that a Hor&s;e is a great deal colder than a Man; &s;eeing that Bea&s;t never dies, but of a Swelling of the Spleen, or other Di&s;ea&s;es that proceed from Melan|choly. Neverthele&s;s, you'l tell me, there is no man in our World engendred of Mud, and produced in that manner: I believe it, your World at pre&s;ent is over-heated; for &s;o &s;oon as the Sun draws a &s;prout out of the Earth, finding none of that cold Humidity, or to &s;ay better, that certain Period of com|pleated Motion, which obliges it to &s;everal Coctions, it turns it pre&s;ently into a Vegeta|ble; or if it make two Coctions, &s;eeing the &s;econd has not time enough to receive per|fection in, it only engenders an In&s;ect. And it is a Remark that I have made al&s;o, That the Ape, which, as we, carrys it's young almo&s;t nine Months, re&s;embles us in &s;o many Hu|mors, that not a few Naturali&s;ts have rank|ed us in the &s;ame Species; and the rea&s;on is, that their Seed being of a temper, much like ours, hath during that time, had almo&s;t the lei&s;ure to perfect tho&s;e three Dige&s;tions.</P>
<P>You'l undoubtedly ask me, of whom I have the Story, that now I have told you; you'l tell me, that I could not have had it from tho&s;e that were not in being: It's true,
<PB N="67" REF="108"> I am the only per&s;on that hath hit upon it, and by con&s;equence I can give no Vouchers for it, becau&s;e it's a thing that happened before I was born; that's likewi&s;e true: But take this along with you al&s;o, That in a Ke|gion bordering upon the Sun, as ours does, the Souls full of Fire are more illuminated, more &s;ubtile, and more penetrant, than tho&s;e of other Animals in remoter Spheres. Now &s;eeing even in your World, there have been Prophets heretofore, who&s;e minds, heightened by a vigorous In&s;piration, have had Fore-knowledge of future things; it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but that in this, which is far nearer the Sun, &amp; by con&s;equence more lumi|nous than yours, a &s;trong <HI>Genius</HI> may have &s;ome &s;melling of what is pa&s;t; that his ac|tive Rea&s;on may move as well backwards, as forwards, and that it may be able to at|tain to the Cau&s;e by the Effects, &s;eeing it can reach the Effects by the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus he ended his Philo&s;ophical Di&s;|&s;cour&s;e; but after a more particular Con&s;e|rence, that we had, about very deep Se|crets, which he revealed to me; part where|of I'll conceal, and of which the re&s;t has e&s;caped me; he told me, That it was not as yet three Weeks, &s;ince a clod of Earth, im|pregnated by the Sun, was brought to Bed of him. Con&s;ider that Tumor attentively. Then he made me ob&s;erve, I know not
<PB N="68" REF="109"> what Swelling upon the Mud, not unlike to a Mole-Hill: That, &s;ays he, is an Apo|&s;tume, or to &s;ay better, a Matrix, which for the&s;e Nine Months pa&s;t, hath contained the Embryo of one of my Brothers. I wait here, on de&s;ign to play the part of a Mid|wife to it.</P>
<P>He would have gone on, had he not per|ceived a Palpitation of the Earth, about that Swelling of Clay. That with the bigne&s;s of the Tumor, made him conclude, that the Earth was in Labour, and that that Shake, was already the effort of the Pangs of Tra|vel. He thereupon immediately left me, that he might run to it; and for my part, I went to look for my Lodge.</P>
<P>I therefore clambered up again the Mountain, I had come down from, and was very weary before I got to the top of it. You may imagine what trouble I was in, when I did not find my Hou&s;e, where I had left it. I began to lament the lo&s;s of it, when I perceived it, skipping and vaulting at a great di&s;tance; I ran thither, as fa&s;t as my Legs could carry me, till I was out of Breath again; and really, it was an agree|able Diver&s;ion, to behold that new way of Cour&s;ing; for &s;ometimes, when I had almo&s;t my Hand upon it, a new encrea&s;e of Heat, got into the Gla&s;s-Ball, which attra|cting the Air with more force, and that
<PB N="69" REF="109"> Air rai&s;ing my Box up above my reach, made me leap after it, as a Cat does to a Hook, where it &s;ees a Hare hanging. Had not my Shirt been upon the Capital, to re|&s;i&s;t the force of the Gla&s;&s;es, it would have made the Voyage by it &s;elf alone.</P>
<P>But to what purpo&s;e is it, to call to mind an Accident that I cannot think on, but with the &s;ame Grief, that I felt at that time! It's enough to know, that it bounded, row|led, and flew &s;o long; and that I jumped, run, and skipped &s;o much, that at length, I &s;aw it fall down, at the Foot of a very high Hill. It had perhaps led me a Dance, a great deal farther, had not that lofty Swel|ling of the Earth, by its &s;hade, that black|ned the Sky, to a large di&s;tance upon the Plain, &s;pread forth a Night of half a Lea|gues Circumference: For falling into that Darkne&s;s, the Gla&s;s thereof no &s;ooner felt the Cool, but that no more Vacuity was en|gendred in it, no more Wind through the Hole, and by con&s;equence, no more Impul|&s;ion to &s;upport it; &s;o that it tumbled down, and would have broken into a Thou&s;and &s;hivers, had not by good luck, a Pond of Water, into which it fell, yielded under the weight. I drew it out of the Water, repaired what was brui&s;ed; and then hav|ing taken fa&s;t hold of it in my Arms, car|ried it to the top of a little Hill, hard by.
<PB N="70" REF="110"> There I took my Shirt off on't; but I could not put it on, becau&s;e my Gla&s;&s;es beginning to work their effect, I perceived my Ca&s;tle already wagging to be gone. I had no more time left, but &s;uddenly to get in, where I &s;hut my &s;elf up as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Sphere of our World, appeared to me as a Planet, much about the bigne&s;s of the Moon, as &s;he appears to us: Nay, it grew le&s;s and le&s;s, &s;till proportionably as I a&s;cended, infomuch that it became a Star, then a Spark, and then nothing at all; for that luminous Point grew &s;o &s;harp, that it might equal that, which terminates the la&s;t Ray of my &s;ight; that at length it was &s;wal|lowed up in the common colour of the Heavens. Some perhaps may wonder, that during &s;o long a Voyage, I was not over|taken with Sleep; but &s;eeing Sleep is only produced by the gentle Exhalation of the Victuals, which evaporate from the Stomach to the Brain, or by a Nece&s;&s;ity that Nature finds of locking up our Soul, that during Repo&s;e, &s;he may recover as ma|ny Spirits, as have been &s;pent in Exerci&s;e: I had no mind to Sleep, &s;ince I did not Eat, and that the Sun &s;upplied me, with more ra|dical Heat, than I con&s;umed. In the mean while, my Elevation continued, and pro|portionably, as it brought me nearer to that enflamed World, I felt a certain Joy diffu&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="110"> it &s;elf through my Blood, which rectified it, and advanced to my very Soul. Ever now and then I looked upwards, that I might admire the Vivacity of the Lu&s;tre, that rayed into my little Chry&s;tal-Hou&s;e; and it is fre&s;h in my Memory &s;till, that at the time I put my Eye to the Orifice of the Ve&s;&s;el, behold, with a &s;udden &s;tart, I felt &s;omething heavy, that fled from all the parts of my Body. A whirling Cloud of very thick, and, in a manner, palpable Smoak, choaked my Gla&s;s with Darkne&s;s; and when I &s;tood up to contemplate that Ob|&s;curity, which blinded me, I &s;aw no more, neither Ve&s;&s;el, nor Burning Gla&s;&s;es, Gla&s;s-Window, nor Covering to my Shed: I looked down, then, with De&s;ign to &s;ee what made my Ma&s;ter-piece thus fall to ru|ine; but in place of it, and of the four Sides and Floor, I found nothing but the Heavens round about me. I was frightned beyond mea&s;ure, when I found, as if the Air had been petrified, I know not what invi&s;ible Ob&s;tacle, which forced back my Arms, when I thought to &s;tretch them forth. It came then into my Imagination, that mounting &s;o high, I had without doubt got into the Firmament, which &s;ome Philo|&s;ophers and A&s;tronomers have maintained to be &s;olid. I began to fear, I &s;hould remain &s;tudded in there; but the Horrour that the
<PB N="72" REF="111"> oddne&s;s of that Accident ca&s;t me into, was exceedingly encrea&s;ed by tho&s;e that fol|lowed: For my &s;ight, that rambled here and there, falling by chance upon my Brea&s;t, in&s;tead of &s;topping at the Surface of my Body, went quite through; then a mo|ment after, I thought I &s;aw behind me, and almo&s;t without any interval, as if my Body had been no more but an Organ of &s;ight: I perceived that my Fle&s;h, being clean&s;ed from its Opacity, transferr'd Objects to my Eyes, and my Eyes Objects through it. At length, having above a Thou&s;and times knockt again&s;t the Roof, Floor, and Walls of my Chair-volant, without being able to &s;ee it; I found, that through a &s;ecret Nece&s;|&s;ity of the Light in its &s;ource, my Shed and I were both become tran&s;parent. Not but that I ought to have perceiv'd it, though
<HI>Dia|phanous,</HI> &s;eeing we very well perceive Gla&s;s, Chry&s;tal, and Diamonds that are &s;o; but I fancy that the Sun, in a Region &s;o near him&s;elf, purges Bodies more perfectly from their Opacity, by ranking more &s;traightly the imperceptible Pores of the Matter, than in our World; where his Force, worn out al|mo&s;t by &s;o long a pa&s;&s;age, is hardly able to transfu&s;e his Lu&s;tre into precious Stones: However, by rea&s;on of the internal Smooth|ne&s;s of their Surfaces, he makes them reflect through their Gla&s;&s;es, as through little
<PB N="73" REF="111"> Eyes, either the Green of Emeralds, the Scarlet of Rubies, or the Violet of Ame|thy&s;ts, according as the different Pores of the Stone, either more &s;traight or more winding, extingui&s;h or rekindle that weak Light, by a great many Reflexions. One difficulty may puzzle the Reader, to wit, How I could &s;ee my &s;elf, and not my Hou&s;e, &s;ee|ing I was become Diaphanous, as well as it? I an&s;wer, That without doubt the Sun acts otherwi&s;e upon animate, than upon inani|mate Bodies; becau&s;e no part neither of my Fle&s;h, Bones nor Entrails, tho' tran&s;parent, had lo&s;t its Natural Colour; on the contra|ry, my Lungs under an incarnate Red, &s;till retained their delicate Softne&s;s: My Heart &s;till Vermilion, gently moved with its <HI>Sy&s;tole,</HI> and <HI>Dia&s;tole:</HI> My Liver &s;eemed to burn in a Purple Red, and boyling the Air which I breathed, continued the Circulation of the Blood: In &s;hort, I &s;aw, touched, and felt my &s;elf to be the &s;ame, and neverthele&s;s I was not &s;o.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was con&s;idering this Metamorpho|&s;is, my Voyage grew &s;horter and &s;horter &s;till, but with a great deal of &s;lowne&s;s then, by rea&s;on of the Serenity of the <HI>Aether,</HI> which was rarified proportionably, as I drew nearer the &s;ource of Day; for &s;eeing the matter in that Region is very thin, becau&s;e of the great Vacuity it is full of, and that by con&s;equence
<PB N="74" REF="112"> that Matter is very lazy, by rea&s;on of the Vacu|ity that has no <HI>Action,</HI> that Air pa&s;&s;ing through the hole of my Box, could not produce but a little Wind, hardly able to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>I never reflected upon the Malicious Ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s of Fortune, which always &s;o ob|&s;tinatly oppo&s;ed the Succe&s;s of my underta|king, but I wonder my brains did not turn. But li&s;ten to a Miracle, which future Ages will hardly be inclined to believe.</P>
<P>Being &s;hut up in a Box as clear as day, that I had ju&s;t lo&s;t &s;ight of, and my flight flagging &s;o, that I had much ado not to fall; in a word, being in a condition, that all that's contained in the great Fabrick of the World, was unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; I found my &s;elf re|duced to the Period of extream Misfortune: Neverthele&s;s, as when we are expiring, we find an internal Impul&s;e in us, to embrace tho&s;e who have given us a Being; I lifted up my Eyes to the Sun, our common Father. That ardour of Will, not only &s;upported my Body, but al&s;o rai&s;ed it up towards the thing, which it a&s;pired to embrace. My Body pu&s;h|ed forwards my Box, and in that manner I continued my Vovage. So &s;oon as I perceiv|ed this, more inten&s;ly than ever, I plyed all the faculties of my Soul, to rai&s;e my Imagi|nation towards that which attracted me; but my head being loaded with my Shed, a|gain&s;t the upper-part whereof, the Efforts
<PB N="75" REF="112"> of my Will pu&s;ht it, whether I would or not, that did &s;o incommode me, that at length &s;o much weight, forced me to grope for the place of its invi&s;ible Door. By good fortune I found it, and having opened it, threw my &s;elf out: But that natural Apprehen&s;ion of falling, which all Animals have, when they find nothing to &s;upport them, made me briskly &s;tretch forth my Arm, that I might take hold of &s;omewhat: I had no other Guide but Nature, which &s;tands not upon Rea&s;oning; and therefore Fortune, her Ene|my, maliciou&s;ly forced my hand upon the Ca|pital of Chry&s;tal. Alas! what Thunder-clap to my Ears, was the &s;ound of the Ico|&s;aedron, which to my hearing broke in pie|ces! Such a Di&s;order, Misfortune, and Fright are beyond all expre&s;&s;ions! The Gla&s;|&s;es attracted no more Air, for no more Va|cuity was made; the Air became no more wind, by its ha&s;tening to fill it, and the wind cea&s;ed to carry my Box on high: In &s;hort, immediately after that wrack, I &s;aw it long a falling through tho&s;e va&s;t plains of the World. It recontracted in the &s;ame Re|gion, the dark Opacity which it had exhaled; in re&s;pect that the energetick Vertue of the Light, cea&s;ing in that place, it greedily vnited again to the ob&s;cure Thickne&s;s, which was in a manner e&s;&s;ential to it; in the &s;ame manner as Spirits, long after their Separati|on,
<PB N="76" REF="113"> have been &s;een to come in &s;earch of their Bodies, and that they might rejoyn them, to wander for the &s;pace of an hundred years about their Graves. I fancy it lo&s;t in this manner its Tran&s;parency, for I have &s;een it &s;ince in <HI>Poland,</HI> in the &s;ame condition it was in, when fir&s;t I entered it. Now I have been informed, that it fell under the Equi|noctial Line, in the Kingdom of <HI>Borneo;</HI> that a
<HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> Merchant bought it of the I&s;lan|der that found it, and that from hand to hand, it fell into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Engineer, who makes u&s;e of it at pre&s;ent to fly with.</P>
<P>Thus, then, hanging in the open &s;pace of the Heavens, and terrified already by the Death, which my fall threatned me with, I turned, as I told you, my &s;ad eyes towards the Sun: My Sight carried my thought thi|ther, and my Looks being fixed upon his Globe, marked out a way which my Will fol|lowed, to tran&s;port my Body to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>That vigorous Launching out of my Soul, will not be incomprehen&s;ible to any, that will but con&s;ider, the &s;imple Efforts of our Will; as, for In&s;tance, It is very well known, that when I have a mind to leap, my Will being excited by my Fan|cy, rai&s;es the whole Microco&s;m, and endea|vours to tran&s;port it to the mark, that it
<PB N="77" REF="113"> propo&s;ed to it &s;elf. If it attain not always to it, it's becau&s;e that the Univer&s;al Prin|ciples of Nature prevail over the Particul|lar; and that the Power of Willing be|ing particular to &s;en&s;itive Beings; and that of falling to the Center, proper to all things, mater<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in general; my Leap is forced to cea&s;e, &s;o &s;oon as the Ma&s;s of my Body, having overcome the In&s;olence of the Will, that &s;urprized it, draws near the Point to which it tends.</P>
<P>I &s;hall wave what el&s;e happened to me, during the re&s;t of my Voyage, le&s;t I &s;hould be as long in relating, as I was in making it: I'll only tell you in general, that at the end of 22. Months, I at length happily arrived at the great plains of Day.</P>
<P>That Land looks like flakes of burning Snow, &s;o luminous it is; neverthele&s;s it is a thing pretty incredible, that I could never comprehend, after that my Box fell, whe|ther I mounted up, or de&s;cended towards the Sun. I only remember, when I arrived there, that I walkt lightly; I toucht only the Ground in a point, and I often rowled like a Bowl, finding it alike commodious, to walk either upon my Head or Feet. Though &s;ometimes my Feet were towards Heaven, and my Shoulders towards the Earth; yet in that po&s;ture, I found my &s;elf as naturally &s;ituated, as if my Feet had
<PB N="78" REF="114"> been towards the Earth, and my Shoulders towards Heaven. Upon what part &s;oever of my Body I placed my &s;elf, whether up|on my Belly, or Back, on Elbow or Ear, I found my &s;elf &s;tanding. By that I knew, that the Sun is a World, which hath no Center; and that as I was far enough from the active Sphere of ours, and of all the o|thers which I met; &s;o by con&s;equence, it was impo&s;&s;ible, that I &s;hould &s;till be ponde|rous, &s;eeing Weight is nothing el&s;e, but an Attraction of the Center, within the Sphere of its Activity.</P>
<P>The Re&s;pect, wherewith I printed my &s;teps upon that Luminous Plain, &s;u&s;pend|ed for &s;ome time, the eager De&s;ire I had to advance on my Journey. I was all a&s;hamed to walk upon the Day: Nay, and my a&s;to|ni&s;hed Body, de&s;iring to relie upon mine Eyes; and that tran&s;parent Ground, which they pierced, not being able to &s;upport them; my In&s;tinct in &s;pight of me, now become Ma&s;ter of my thought, hurried it into the Aby&s;s of a bottomle&s;s Light. My Rea&s;on neverthele&s;s, by degrees undecei|ved my In&s;tinct; I walked confidently, and without trembling upon the Plain, and di|rected my &s;teps &s;o boldly, that if Men could have perceived me from their World, they would have taken me for &s;ome Power marching upon the Clouds. Having, as I think,
<PB N="79" REF="114"> travelled about fifteen days time, I came in|to a Country of the Sun, not &s;o re&s;plendent as tho&s;e I had left. I found my &s;elf tran&s;port|ed with Joy, and I imagined, that undoubt|edly that Joy proceeded from a &s;ecret Sym|pathy, which my Being &s;till retained with its Opacity. Neverthele&s;s, the knowledge I had of this, made me not de&s;i&s;t from my Enterpri&s;e; for then I was like to tho&s;e &s;leepy Old men, who tho' they know that &s;leep is hurtful to them, and that they have ordered their Ser|vants, to &s;natch them out of it's Clutches, are neverthele&s;s very angry when they awaken them. In like manner, tho' my Body growing ob&s;cure, as I reached the darker Pro|vinces, recontracted the weakne&s;&s;es, that that infirmity of matter brings along with it; yet I was plea&s;ed therewith: Growing wea|ry, &s;leep invaded me; for that flattering Hea|vine&s;s, wherewith the approaches of &s;leep charms us, di&s;tilled &s;o much plea&s;ure into my Veins, that my Sen&s;es over come thereby, forced my Spirit to congratulate the Tyrant, who chained its Servants; for Sleep, that An|tient Tyrant of one half of our days, who becau&s;e of his Old age, being unable to &s;up|port the Light, or to look on it without fainting, was forced to for&s;ake me, upon my entry into the &s;hining Countries of the Sun, was come to expect me on the Confines of the dusky Region I &s;peak of; where having
<PB N="80" REF="115"> caught me, he made me Pri&s;oner, &s;hut up my Eyes, his declared enemies, under the dark vault of my Eye-lids; and for fear that my o|ther Sen&s;es betraying him, as they had be|trayed me, might di&s;turb him in the peace|able po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Conque&s;t, he tied them fa&s;t to their &s;everal Beds. The meaning of all this is in two words, that I lay down up|on the Sand, and fell a&s;leep. It was a plain Country, and &s;o open that as far as my &s;ight could reach, I did not di&s;cover &s;o much as one Bu&s;h; and neverthele&s;s when I a woke, I found my &s;elf under a Tree, in re&s;pect of which the talle&s;t Cedars would but appear as Gra&s;s. The Trunk of it was of Ma&s;&s;ive Gold, it's Branches of Silver, and it's Leaves of Emeralds, which upon the re&s;plendent Ver|dure of their precious Surface, repre&s;ented, as in a Looking-Gla&s;s, the Images of the Fruit that hang about them. But judge ye whether the Fruit owed any thing to the Leaves; the enflamed Scarlet of a large Car|buncle, compo&s;ed one half of every one of them; and the other was in &s;u&s;pence, whe|ther it held it's matter of a Chry&s;olite, or of a piece of gilt Amber; the blown Blo&s;|&s;oms were large Ro&s;es of Diamonds, and o|riental Pearls the Buds.</P>
<P>A Nightingale, who&s;e &s;mooth Plume ren|dered it exceeding lovely, perching on the highe&s;t &s;prig, &s;eemed &s;ollicitous, with it's
<PB N="81" REF="115"> Melody, to force the Eyes to confe&s;s to the Ears, that it well de&s;erved the Throne where|on it &s;ate.</P>
<P>I &s;tood a long while amazed at the &s;ight of that rich Spectacle, and I could not have my full of beholding it: But whil&s;t my thoughts were wholly taken up in contempla|ting, among&s;t the other Fruit, an exceeding lovely Pomegranate, who&s;e Fle&s;h was a &s;warm of large Rubies in clu&s;ters, I &s;aw that little Crown that &s;tands it in&s;tead of a Head move, which lengthened it &s;elf, as much as was needful, to form a Neck; next I &s;aw &s;omewhat white bubble and boil over it, which by means of Conden&s;ation, Concretion advancing and repelling the matter in certain places, appeared at length to be the face of a little bulk of Fle&s;h. That little bulk &s;hap|ed it &s;elf into a round Figure towards the girdle, that's to &s;ay, that in the lower part of it, it &s;till retained the &s;hape of an Apple. Ne|verthele&s;s it extended it &s;elf by degrees, and the tail of it being converted into two Legs, each Leg divided it &s;elf into five Toes. So &s;oon as the Pomegranate was humanized, it broke off from its &s;talk, and with a gentle To&s;s fell ju&s;t at my Feet. I confe&s;s, really, when I &s;aw marching &s;tately before me that rational Apple, that little Butt-end of a Dwarf, no bigger than my Thumb, and yet &s;o powerful as to create him&s;elf; I was &s;eized
<PB N="82" REF="116"> with Veneration. Human Animal (&s;aid he to me, in that Original Tongue I told you of before,) after I had long con&s;idered thee, from the top of the Branch where I hung; I thought I read in thy countenance, that thou wa&s;t no Native of this World, and that's the rea&s;on why I am come down to be in|formed of the truth. When I had &s;atisfied his Curio&s;ity, as to all the que&s;tions he put to me&mdash;But pray, &s;aid I to him, tell me who you are; for what I have now &s;een, is &s;o &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ing, that I de&s;pair of ever knowing the Cau&s;e of it, unle&s;s you di&s;co|ver it to me. How! a great Tree all of pure Gold, the Leaves whereof are Emeralds, the Flowers Diamonds, the Buds Pearls; and be&s;ides all that, Fruit that make them&s;elves men in the twinkling of an Eye? For my part, I confe&s;s it pa&s;&s;es my Capacity, to com|prehend &s;uch a Miracle. Having uttered this Exclamation, whil&s;t I expected his an&s;wer: You will not take it ami&s;s, &s;aid he to me, if being King of all the people that make up this Tree, I call them to follow me. When he had &s;o &s;aid, I ob&s;erved that he recoiled within him&s;elf: I cannot tell, whether by bending the internal &s;prings of his Will, he excited without him &s;ome Motion, that pro|duced what now you &s;hall hear: But &s;o it is, That immediately after, all the Leaves and Branches, in &s;hort the whole Tree, broke
<PB N="83" REF="116"> to pieces, and became little Men, that &s;aw, felt, and walked, who as if they intended to celebrate their Birth-day, at the very in|&s;tant of their production, fell a dancing a|bout me: Of all, I &s;aw none but the Night|ingale retained it's former &s;hape, and was not at all Metamorpho&s;ed; it came and perched upon the Shoulder of our little Monarch, where it Sung &s;o melancholick and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">orous an Air, that the whole A&s;&s;em|bly, and the Prince him&s;elf, mollified by the &s;weet Langui&s;hings of its dying Voice, could not forbear to &s;hed &s;ome Tears. A Curio&s;ity to learn whence that Bird came, &s;eized me at that time, with &s;uch an extraordinary Itch of Tongue, that I could not for my heart re|&s;train it. Sir, &s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to the King, did I not fear to trouble your Maje&s;ty, I would ask you the que&s;tion, why among&s;t &s;o many Transformations, the Nightingale a|lone hath retained its kind? That little Prince li&s;tened to me with &s;o much Civility, that it &s;hew'd he had a great deal of good Nature; and knowing my Curio&s;ity: The Nightin|gale, replied he, hath not changed its Form as we have done, becau&s;e it could not; it's a real Bird, and nothing el&s;e than what it appears to be to you. But let's go towards the ob&s;curer Regions, and by the way I'll tell you who I am, and give you the Sto|ry of the Nightingale. Hardly had I intima|ted
<PB N="84" REF="117"> to him, the Satisfaction that I receiv'd from his offer, when he &s;kipped nimbly up upon one of my Shoulders. He &s;tood upon his lit|tle Tip-toes, that he might reach my ear with his Mouth; and &s;ometimes &s;winging, &s;ome|times pe&s;tered in my Hair: In troth, &s;aid he, thou mu&s;t e'en excu&s;e one that's already out of breath; &s;eeing in a narrow Body my <HI>Lungs</HI> are contracted, and by con&s;equence my Voice &s;o &s;mall, that I am forced to take a great deal of pains, to make my &s;elf be heard: The Nightingale would do be&s;t, to tell it's own Hi&s;tory it &s;elf; let it &s;ing, then, if it think fit, we &s;hall have the Plea&s;ure, at lea&s;t to hear it's Story in Mu&s;ick. I replied, that I was not as yet, &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Language of the Bird; that a certain Philo|&s;opher, indeed, whom I met with, as I was mounting up to the Sun, had given me &s;ome general Principles, for under&s;tanding the Lan|guage of Brutes; but that they were not &s;uffi|cient, for the under&s;tanding of all words in ge|neral, nor for being affected with all the De|licacies that occur in an adventure, &s;uch as that mu&s;t needs be. Well then, &s;aid he, &s;ince thou'lt have it &s;o, thine Ears &s;hall not only be deprived of the &s;weet Songs of the Nightin|gale; but in a manner of all its adventure al&s;o, of which I can tell thee no more, than what is come to my knowledge: However be content with that Pattern; be&s;ides tho'
<PB N="85" REF="117"> I knew it fully, yet the &s;hortne&s;s of our jour|ney into it's Country, whither I am going to carry it back again, would not &s;uffer me to enlarge in my Relation. Having &s;aid &s;o, he jumpt down from my Shoulder upon the ground; then he gave the hand to all his lit|tle People, and fell a dancing with them in a kind of Figure, that I cannot repre&s;ent, the like having never &s;een. But hearken, O ye people of the Earth, to what I don't at all oblige you to believe; &s;eeing in that World, where your Miracles are but natural Effects, this hath pa&s;t for a real Miracle. So &s;oon as the&s;e little men were fallen a dancing, I thought I felt their Agitation in my &s;elf, and my Agitation in them. I could not be|hold that Dance, but that I was &s;en&s;ibly drawn out of my place, as by a <HI>Vortex</HI> that moved by it's own whirling, and by the particular Agitation of every one of them, all the parts of my Body were put into Agitati|on; &s;o that I felt the &s;ame Gayne&s;s flu&s;h in my countenance, which a like Motion had &s;pread upon theirs. As the Dance clo&s;ed more and more, the Dancers &s;huffled together, by a prompter and more imperceptible way of skipping. The de&s;ign of the Ball &s;eemed to be, to repre&s;ent a huge Giant; for by ap|proaching to one another, and redoubling the &s;wiftne&s;s of their Motions, they ming|led &s;o clo&s;e together, that I di&s;tingui&s;hed no
<PB N="86" REF="118"> more, but a great tran&s;parent <HI>Colo&s;&s;us;</HI> how|ever my eyes &s;aw them enter one into ano|ther. About that time, it began to be out of my power, any more to di&s;cern the Diver|&s;ity of their &s;everal Motions, by rea&s;on of their extream Volubility; and al&s;o becau&s;e that Volubility, contracting more and more, according as it approached to the Center, each vortical Trip at length, took up &s;o little a &s;pace, that it e&s;caped my eye-&s;ight. Ne|verthele&s;s I believe, that the parts &s;till ap|proached one another; for that humane Ma&s;s, heretofore &s;o hugely great, was by degrees reduced into the &s;hape of a young Man, of a middle &s;tature, who&s;e Members were proportioned with &s;o exact a Symetry, that the highe&s;t Idea of perfection could ne|ver reach it: He was beautiful, beyond all that the fancy of Painters could ever imagin; but that which &s;eemed to me very &s;trange was, that all the parts which compleated that perfect Microco&s;m, were linked toge|ther in the twinkling of an eye; the nim|bler &s;ort of our little Dancers cut a Capriol, to the height and natural po&s;ture of form|ing a Head. The hotter, but le&s;s agile, formed the Heart; and tho&s;e that were much heavi|er, furni&s;hed only the Bones, Fle&s;h, and Plumpne&s;s.</P>
<P>When that lovely big young Man, was compleatly fini&s;hed, though the &s;peedy
<PB N="87" REF="118"> Compo&s;ition of him, had hardly allowed me time to ob&s;erve any interval in the Pro|gre&s;&s;ion; I &s;aw the King of all the&s;e Peo|ple, of whom he was an Abridgement, en|ter in at the Mouth: Nay, it &s;eemed to me, that he was drawn into that Body, by the Re&s;piration of the Body it &s;elf. This Pile of little Men, had not as yet given any &s;ign of Life; but &s;o &s;oon as it had &s;ucked in its little King, it perceived it &s;elf then, to be no more but one. For &s;ome time he &s;tood con&s;idering of me, and &s;eeming by his looks, now acquainted with me, he drew near, care&s;&s;ed me, and giving me his Hand: Now it is, &s;aid he, that without wrong|ing the delicatene&s;s of my Lungs, I can en|tertain thee with the things, that thou pa&s;&s;i|onately de&s;ired&s;t to know: But fir&s;t of all, it's but rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould di&s;cover to thee, the hidden Secrets of our Original. Know then, that we are native Animals of the brighter Regions of the Sun; the mo&s;t ordinary, as well as the mo&s;t u&s;eful of our Employments, is to Travel over the va&s;t Countries of this great World. We curi|ou&s;ly ob&s;erve the Manners of People, the Genius of Climates, and the Nature of all things, that de&s;erve our Con&s;ideration; by means whereof, we form to our &s;elves, a cer|tain Science of every thing that hath a Be|ing. Now thou mu&s;t know, that my Va&s;|&s;als
<PB N="88" REF="119"> travelled under my Conduct; and to the end, we might have time to ob&s;erve things more curiou&s;ly, we retained not that par|ticular Conformation of our Bodies, which cannot fall under they Sen&s;es, and who&s;e Sub|tilty would have made us make too much ha&s;te; but we converted our &s;elves into Birds; all my Subjects, by my Orders, be|came Eagles; and as for my &s;elf, lea&s;t they might grow weary, I Metamorpho&s;ed my &s;elf into a Nightingale, to &s;weeten their La|bour, by the Charms of Mu&s;ick: Without flying, I followed the rapid flight of my People; for I perched upon the Head of one of my Va&s;&s;als, and we were &s;till pur&s;u|ing our Journey; when a Nightingale, an Inhabitant of a Province of the ob&s;cure Country, that at that time we Travelled through, a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee me in the Power of an Eagle (for it could take us for none o|ther, but what it &s;aw us to be) fell a bewail|ing my Misfortune: I ordered my People to halt, and we lighted on the top of &s;ome Trees, where that Charitable Bird lamented. I took &s;o much Plea&s;ure in the &s;weetne&s;s of her dole|ful Airs, that to the end I might enjoy them the longer, and with more convenience, I re|&s;olved not to undeceive her. I devi&s;ed upon the &s;pot a Story, wherein I told her the imagi|nary Misfortunes, that had made me fall into the power of that Eagle: I pieced it out with
<PB N="89" REF="119"> &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing Adventures, which &s;o dexterou&s;ly rai&s;ed the Pa&s;&s;ions, and the Air was &s;o well adap|ted to the Letter, that the Nightingale, was quite be&s;ide her &s;elf. We reciprocally warbled to one another, the Hi&s;tory of our mutual Love in Mu&s;ick. I chanted in my Airs, that not only I was comfor|ted, but even rejoyced in my di&s;a&s;ter, &s;eeing it had procured me the Glory, to be lamented in &s;uch pretty Songs; and that little di&s;con&s;olate Bird an&s;wered me in hers, that &s;he would joyfully ac|cept all the e&s;teem, I put upon her; if &s;he thought, that that could make her de&s;erve, the Honour of dying in my place; but that Fortune, not having re&s;erved &s;o much Glory, for &s;uch a Wretch as &s;he, &s;he only accepted of that e&s;teem, as much as might hinder me, from being a&s;hamed of my Friend&s;hip. I made an&s;wer again, on my part, with all the tran&s;ports, tenderne&s;s, and &s;oftne&s;s of &s;o touching a Pa&s;&s;ion, that I perceiv'd her, three or four times, rea|dy to die of Love, upon the Branch. The Truth is, I mingled &s;o much Art, with the Sweetne&s;s of my Voice, and &s;urprized her Ear with &s;uch quaint Touches, and by ways &s;o unu&s;ual to tho&s;e of her Kind, that I rai&s;ed in her pretty Soul, what Pa&s;&s;ion &s;oever I plea&s;ed. In this Exerci&s;e, we &s;pent four and twenty Hours; and I believe, we had never given over making of Love, had not our Throats denied us any more Voice. That was the only Ob&s;tacle, that hindred us from proceeding: For perceiving, that the Pains I took, began to tear my Throat, and that I could hold out no lon|ger, without falling into a Swoon, I made her a &s;ign to draw near to me. The danger &s;he thought me to be in, amid&s;t &s;o many Eagles, per&s;waded her, that I called her to my aid: She came flie|ing
<PB N="90" REF="120"> immediately, to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and re&s;olv|ing to give me a Glorious In&s;tance, that &s;he could for a Friend brave Death even upon his Throne, &s;he boldly lighted upon the great crooked Beak of the Eagle, where I was perched. Really, &s;o &s;trong a Courage, in &s;o weak a Creature, affe|cted me, with &s;ome Veneration; for, grant I had implored her aid, as &s;he fancied, and that it be a Law, among&s;t Animals of the &s;ame kind, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the unfortunate; yet, the In&s;tinct of her timorous Nature, ought to have made her wa|ver; and neverthele&s;s, &s;he boggled not in the lea&s;t: On the contrary, &s;he made &s;o much ha&s;te, that I cannot tell which flew fir&s;t, the Signal, or the Nightingale. Proud, to &s;ee under her Feet, the Head of her Tyrant, and ravi&s;hed, to think that for my &s;ake, &s;he was to be Sacrificed, almo&s;t under my Wings, and that &s;ome happy drops of her Blood, might perhaps Jert upon my Feathers, &s;he gently turned her Eyes to me, and having bid me <HI>adieu,</HI> as it were, by a Glance, which &s;eem|ed to ask me leave to die; &s;he &s;truck &s;o briskly her little Beak, into the Eyes of the Eagle, that they &s;eemed to me to be out, before the peck was given. When my Bird perceived it &s;elf to be blind, it formed to it &s;elf another &s;ight of new. I gently rebuked the Nightingale, for her too ra&s;h Action; and thinking it would be danger|ous to conceal our real Being, any longer from her, I told her, who we were; but the poor lit|tle thing, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an Opinion, that the&s;e Barbarians, who&s;e Pri&s;oner I was, forced me to devi&s;e that Tale, gave no credit to all that I could &s;ay to her. When I found that all the Rea&s;ons, whereby I thought to convince her, proved inef|fectual,
<PB N="91" REF="120"> I gave private Orders, to ten or twelve thou&s;and of my Subjects, and immediately, the Nightingale, perceived under her Feet, a River, running under a Boat, and the Boat floating up|on it; the Boat was no bigger, than was &s;uffici|ent to hold me, and another of my Size. At the fir&s;t Signal given, my Eagles flew away, and I threw my &s;elf into the Skiff; from whence, I called to the Nightingale, that if &s;he could not as yet, re&s;olve to leave me &s;o &s;oon, &s;he &s;hould embark with me. So &s;oon as &s;he was come in, I commanded the River to take its cour&s;e, to|wards the Region, whither my People flew; but the fluidity of the Water, being inferiour to that of the Air, and by con&s;equence, the Rapi|dity of their flight greater than that of ours, we were left a little behind. During the whole Voy|age, I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s, to undeceive my lit|tle Pa&s;&s;enger; I told her, that &s;he ought not to expect any fruit of her Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ince we were not of the &s;ame Kind, that &s;he might very well have perceived that, when the Eagle, who&s;e Eyes &s;he had &s;truck out, framed to it &s;elf new ones, in her pre&s;ence, and when at my command, twelve thou&s;and of my Subjects, had Metamorpho&s;ed them&s;elves, into that River and Boat, which carried us. My Remon&s;trances had not the lea&s;t Succe&s;s: She made me an&s;wer, that as for the Ea|gle, who, I would have it believed, had formed to it &s;elf Eyes, it had no need of them; becau&s;e &s;he had not &s;truck her Beak right into the Ball of its Eye; and as to the River and Boat, which I &s;aid to have been begot only of a Metamorpho|&s;is of my People, they were in the Wood from the Creation of the World, though they had not
<PB N="92" REF="121"> been minded. Perceiving her &s;o Ingenious, in deceiving her &s;elf, I agreed with her, that my Va&s;&s;als, and I, &s;hould Metamorpho&s;e our &s;elves to her view, into what &s;he plea&s;ed; provided, that after that, &s;he would return to her own Country. Sometime, &s;he de&s;ired it &s;hould be into a Tree; &s;ometime, &s;he wi&s;hed it might be into a Flower; &s;ometime into Fruit, &s;ometime into Metal, and &s;ometime into Stone. In fine, that I might at once &s;atisfie all her De&s;ires, when we arrived at my Court, where I ordered her to expect me, we Metamorpho&s;ed our &s;elves, to the Eyes of the Nightingale, into that precious Tree, thou foun|de&s;t upon the Road, of which we have ju&s;t now abandoned the form. Now after all, that I &s;ee that little Bird, re&s;olved to return into her own Country, my Subjects, and I, are about to re&s;ume our Figure, and the right way of our Journey: But it is but rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould fir&s;t di&s;co|ver to thee, that we are Natives, and <HI>Aborigenes</HI> of the Sun, in the bright part thereof; for there is a very remarkable Difference, betwixt the Peo|ple, which the Luminous Region produces, and the People of the ob&s;cure Country. We are they, whom in the World of the Earth, ye call Spi|rits, and your pre&s;umptuous &s;tupidity, hath gi|ven us that Name; becau&s;e, imagining no Ani|mal, more perfect than Man, and perceiving that &s;ome Creatures, perform things above Humane Power, you have taken the&s;e Animals for Spirits. You are mi&s;taken though, we are Animals as well as you: For although when we plea&s;e, we give to our Matter, as you have ju&s;t now &s;een, the e&s;|&s;ential Figure, and Form of the things, into which we have a mind to transform our &s;elves,
<PB N="93" REF="121"> that does not infer that we are Spirits. But li&s;ten, and I'll di&s;cover to thee, how all the&s;e Transfor|mations, which &s;eem to thee to be &s;o many Mi|racles, are no more but pure natural Effects. Thou mu&s;t know, that being born Inhabitants of the bright part of this great World, where it is the Principle of Matter to be in Action; we ought to have the Imagination, far more active, than tho&s;e of the ob&s;cure Regions, and the Sub&s;tance of Body, far more &s;ubtil al&s;o. Now this being &s;uppo&s;ed, it mu&s;t needs be, that our Imagination meeting with no Ob&s;tacle, in the matter that compo&s;es us, it di&s;po&s;es the &s;ame as it plea&s;es, and becoming Mi&s;tre&s;s of all our Ma&s;s, makes it by moving all its Particles, to pa&s;s into the order, ne|ce&s;&s;ary for con&s;tituting that great thing, which it had formed in little. So that every one of us, having imagined the place, and part of that pre|cious Tree, into which we had a mind to be chan|ged; and having by that effort of Imagination, excited our matter to the Motions, nece&s;&s;ary for producing them, we transformed our &s;elves into the &s;ame. Thus my Eagle, having his Eyes peckt out, had no more to do, for re&s;toring of them again, but to imagine him&s;elf a &s;harp-&s;ight|ed Eagle; for all our Transformations, are per|formed by Motion; and therefore it is that, when from Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit that we were, we became tran&s;muted into Men, thou &s;awe&s;t us dance &s;till &s;ometime after, becau&s;e we were not as yet recovered from the agitation, which we ought to give to our matter, for making of us Men: After the manner of Bells; which though they be &s;topt, yet Chime for &s;ome time after, and dully retain the &s;ame
<PB N="94" REF="122"> &s;ound, which was cau&s;ed by the &s;triking of the Clapper; and therefore thou &s;awe&s;t us dance, be|fore we made that great Man, becau&s;e for pro|duction of him, it behoved us to take all the ge|neral, and particular Motions, that were nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute him; to the end that that agitation by degrees compre&s;&s;ing, and compacting our &s;everal Bodies by it's motion, might create in every part the &s;pecifick Motion, which it ought to have. Ye men of the other world, cannot do the &s;ame things, by rea&s;on of the Heavine&s;s of your Ma&s;s, and the Coldne&s;s of your Imagination.</P>
<P>He continued his Probation, and illu&s;trated it by &s;o familiar and palpable In&s;tances, that at length I was undeceiv'd of a great many ill prov'd opinions, wherewith our ob&s;tinate Doctors po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of the weak. At that time I began to conceive, that in reality, the imagination of the&s;e Solar people, which by rea&s;on of the Climate ought to be hotter, their Bodies for the &s;ame rea&s;on lighter, and their per&s;ons more active (there be|ing in that World, as there is in ours, no Acti|vity of the Center, which may divert the matter from the motion, which that Imagination &s;tamps upon it:) I conceived, I &s;ay, that that Imagination might produce without a Miracle, all the Mira|cles which it had performed. A thou&s;and Exam|ples of almo&s;t the like effects, affirmed by people of our Globe, fully per&s;waded me of this <HI>Cippus</HI> K. of <HI>Italy,</HI> who having been pre&s;ent at a fight of Bulls, and his imagination all the night after, running upon Horns, found his forehead horned next morn|ing. <HI>Gallus Vitius,</HI> who bent his mind, and &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly excited it, to conceive the Nature of Folly; that having by an effort of Imagination, given
<PB N="95" REF="122"> to his matter the &s;ame motions, that that matter ought to have for con&s;tituting Folly, be|came a Fool. King <HI>Codrus</HI> being Pti&s;ical, and fixing his eyes and thoughts upon the fre&s;h looks of a young Countenance, and that florid Chearfulne&s;s which darted upon him, from the youthfulne&s;s of the Boy, exciting in his Body the motion, whereby he fancied the healthfulne&s;s of a young man, recovered his Health. In &s;hort, ma|ny Women have made their Children, already formed in the Womb, Mon&s;ters; becau&s;e their imagination, that was not &s;trong enough, to give to them&s;elves the Figure of the Mon&s;ters, which they conceived, had force &s;ufficient to mu&s;ter the matter of the <HI>Faetus,</HI> that was much hotter, and more moveable than their own, into an order prop|per for the production of the&s;e Mon&s;ters. Nay I was per&s;waded, that when that famous Hypochon|driacal man of Antiquity, imagined him&s;elf to be a Pitcher, if his two compact and heavy matter could have followed the emotion of his Fancy, it would have formed of his entire Body a perfect Pitcher; and he would have appeared to all men to be a real Pitcher, &s;o as he appeared to be to him&s;elf alone. A great many other In&s;tances, where|with I &s;atisfied my &s;elf, &s;o throughly convinced me, that I made no doubt any more, of the won|ders which the Man-&s;pirit told me. He asked me, if I de&s;ired any thing el&s;e of him; and I thanked him with all my Heart: After that, he had &s;till the goodne&s;s to advi&s;e me, that &s;ince I was an In|habitant of the Earth, I &s;hould follow the Night|ingale into the ob&s;cure Regions of the Sun; becau&s;e they were more &s;utable to the plea&s;ures which Human Nature covets. No &s;ooner had he con|cluded
<PB N="96" REF="123"> this di&s;cour&s;e, but that opening his Mouth very wide, I &s;aw the King of the&s;e little Animals come out of his Throat, in &s;hape of a Nightingale. The great man in&s;tantly fell down, and at the &s;ame time, all his Members by mor|cels flew away under the form of Eagles. That Nightingale &s;elf-Creator, perched upon the fair|e&s;t of them, from whence he warbled out a mo&s;t excellent Air, whereby, I fancy, he gave me the Farewel. The real Nightingale took flight al&s;o, but not the way as they did, nor did &s;he &s;oar &s;o high; &s;o that I did not lo&s;e &s;ight of her. We tra|velled much about the &s;ame rate; for &s;eeing I was indifferent what Country I went to fir&s;t, I was very willing to accompany her; be&s;ides that the ob&s;cure regions of the Birds, being more con|form to my Con&s;titution, I hoped al&s;o to meet with Adventures there, more agreeable to my hu|mour. In that Expectation I travelled for the &s;pace of three weeks at lea&s;t, with all imaginable content, had I had nothing but my ears to &s;atis|fie; for the Nightingale let me not be without Mu|&s;ick; when &s;he was weary, &s;he came and re&s;ted upon my Shoulder; and when I &s;topt, &s;he &s;taid for me. At length I arrived in a Country, of the Kingdom of that little Quiri&s;ter; who then ca|red no more for my Company, &s;o that I lo&s;t &s;ight of her. I &s;ought her, and called to her; but at length growing weary of running up and down in vain after her, I re&s;olved to take &s;ome re&s;t: For that end I laid my &s;elf along upon a &s;oft Carpet of Gra&s;s, &s;pread at the Root of a lofty Rock, that was covered with many trees, who&s;e blith and fre&s;h Verdure was a perfect Emblem of Youth: But whil&s;t &s;oftened by the Charms of the place.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of <HI>BIRDS.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>I Began to fall a&s;leep in the Shade, I perceived in the Air a &s;trange Bird, that hovered over my Head; it &s;upported it &s;elf by &s;o &s;light and imperceptible a mo|tion, that I was many times in doubt, whether it might not be al&s;o a little Univer&s;e, balanced by its own Center. However by little and little it de&s;|cended, and at length came &s;o near, that it filled my Eyes with a delight|ful Pro&s;pect. The Tail of it &s;eemed to be green, its Brea&s;t Azure-enamel'd, its Wings Incarnate, and its Head Purple, which to&s;&s;ed a glittering Crown of Gold, the Rayes whereof &s;parkled from its Eyes.</P>
<P>It kept a long time upon the Wing, and I was &s;o attentive to ob&s;erve what became on't, that my Soul being con|tracted, and in a manner wrapt up in the &s;ole action of Seeing, it hardly reached my Ear, to let me hear that the Bird &s;poke as it &s;ung.</P>
<P>However, being by little and little unbent from my Exta&s;ie, I di&s;tinctly remarked the Syllables, Words, and Di&s;cour&s;e which it uttered.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="124"> To the be&s;t of my Memory, then it &s;pun out its Song into the&s;e terms,</P>
<P>You are a Stranger, whi&s;tled the Bird, and has had your birth in a World, of which originally I am. Now that &s;ecret propen&s;ity to mutual Love, that tho&s;e of the &s;ame Country have one for another, is the in&s;tinct, which Inclines me to inform you of my Life.</P>
<P>I perceive your mind puzled to conceive, how it is po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould expre&s;s my &s;elf to you, in a continued Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ee|ing though Birds imitate your words, they under&s;tand not the meaning of them; but, on the other hand, when you coun|terfeit the Barking of a <HI>Dog,</HI> or the Note of a <HI>Nightingale,</HI> you under&s;tand as little what the <HI>Dog</HI> or <HI>Nightingale</HI> means there|by. Conclude then from thence, That neither Birds nor Men are therefore the le&s;s rational.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, in the &s;ame manner as among&s;t you, there have been &s;ome &s;o Ingenious, as to have under&s;tood and &s;po|ken our Language, as <HI>Apollonius, Thiane|us, Aneximander, Ae&s;op,</HI> and many others, who&s;e names I conceal, becau&s;e they ne|ver came to our knowledge; &s;o there are tho&s;e among&s;t us, who under&s;tand and &s;peak yours.

<PB N="99" REF="124"> as there are &s;ome Birds that &s;ay nothing at all, &s;ome that chirp, and others that &s;peak; there are al&s;o &s;ome more perfect, who can make u&s;e of all Idioms; as for my &s;elf, I have the honour to be one of that &s;mall number.</P>
<P>After all, you mu&s;t know, that in what world &s;oever it be, nature hath &s;tamped on Birds a &s;ecret de&s;ire of flying up hither; and perhaps that Emotion of our Will is, that which hath made our Wings to grow; as Women with Child imprint upon their Children, the figure of the things they have longed for; or rather as tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ionately would learn to Swim, have been &s;een in their &s;leep to jump into Rivers, and with more skill than an experienced Swimmer pa&s;s tho&s;e dangers, that if they had been awake, they dur&s;t not have &s;o much as beheld; or as the Son of that &s;ame King
<HI>Crae&s;us,</HI> whom a vehement de&s;ire of &s;peaking, to &s;ave his Father's Life, taught a Language all of a &s;udden; or in &s;hort, as that Ancient who being pur&s;ued by his Enemy, and &s;urpri&s;ed without Arms, had Bulls Horns grow out on his Fore-head, through the de&s;ire that a Rage, not unlike to that of that Bea&s;t, in&s;pired in|to him.</P>
<P>When Birds then arrive in the Sun, they go and a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves to the Repub|lick
<PB N="100" REF="125"> of their kind. I well perceive, you are big with expectation to learn what I am, it is I who among&s;t you am called a
<HI>Phenix,</HI> in every world there is but one at a time, which lives there for the &s;pace of an hundred Years; for at the end of an Age, when upon &s;ome Mountain of <HI>Ara|bia,</HI> it hath laid a great Egg amid&s;t the Coals of its Funeral Pile, which it hath made of the Branches of Aloes, Cinnamon and Frankincen&s;e, it takes its flight, and diverts its cour&s;e towards the Sun, as the Country to which its heart hath long a&s;|pired. It hath indeed made many At|tempts before, for accompli&s;hing that Voy|age; but the weight of its Egg, which hath &s;o thick a &s;hell, that it requires an Age to be hatched in, &s;till retarded the Enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that you can hardly com|prehend that miraculous Production; and therefore I'll explain it to you. The
<HI>Phe|nix</HI> is an Hermaprodite, but among&s;t Her|maphrodites, it is likewi&s;e another <HI>Phenix</HI> altogether extraordinary: For&mdash;</P>
<P>It continued half a quarter of an hour without &s;peaking, and then added: I per|ceive you &s;u&s;pect what I have told you to be fal&s;e, but if what I &s;ay be not true, the fir&s;t time I come into your Globe, may an Eagle devour me.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="125"> It remained a little while longer hover|ing upon Wing, and then flew away.</P>
<P>The Admiration that its relation put me into, gave me the Curio&s;ity to follow it; and becau&s;e it cut the Welkin with no &s;wift flight, I ea&s;ily kept within &s;ight of it.</P>
<P>At the end of Fifty Leagues, or therea|bouts, I found my &s;elf in a Country &s;o full of Birds, that their number equalled al|mo&s;t the number of the leaves that cove|red them. The thing that &s;urpri&s;ed me mo&s;t was, that in &s;tead of growing wilder upon my coming, they flew about me, one chirped into my Ears, another fetch|ed a compa&s;s about my head: In &s;hort, when their Gambols had for a long time taken up my attention, all of a &s;udden I felt my Arms loaded with above a Million of all &s;orts and kinds, which pre&s;&s;ed them down &s;o heavily, that I could not move them.</P>
<P>They held me in this po&s;ture, until I &s;aw Four great Eagles come, of which Two having with their Talons taken fa&s;t hold on me by the Legs, and the other Two by the Arms, they carried me up aloft in the Air.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Wood I &s;pied a Magpy, that made a great bu&s;tle flying up and down; and I heard her call to me, that I
<PB N="102" REF="126"> &s;hould not make re&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e her Companions were already con&s;ulting to put out my Eyes. This admonition put a &s;top to all the Strugling that I could have made; &s;o that the&s;e Eagles carried me above a Thou|&s;and Leagues from thence into a great Wood, which was (as the Magpy told me) the City where their King held his Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing they did, was to throw me into Pri&s;on, in the hollow Trunk of a large Oak; and a great many of the &s;trong|e&s;t perched upon the Branches, where they performed the duty of a Company of Souldiers &s;tanding to their Arms.</P>
<P>About the end of Four and twenty hours, another Company mounted the Guard, and relieved the&s;e. In the mean time, whil&s;t I waited with a great deal of Melancholy, to know what it would plea&s;e Fortune to determine of me; amid&s;t my Misfortunes my charitable Magpy informed me of all that pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other things, I remember &s;he told me, That the Mobile of the Birds, had made a heavy Rout, becau&s;e they had kept me &s;o long without devouring me; that they had alledged I would grow &s;o lean, that there would be nothing of me left but Bones to pick.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="126"> The Clamor was like to break out into a Sedition; for my Magpy having taken the boldne&s;s to repre&s;ent, That it was a barbarous Procedure to put to death in that manner without any Tryal, an Ani|mal, which in &s;ome &s;ort had Rea&s;on as well as they; they had like to have torn her to pieces, pretending that it would be very ri|diculous, to think that an Animal &s;tark naked, which Nature her &s;elf, when &s;he produced it, took no care to furni&s;h with things nece&s;&s;ary for its Pre&s;ervation, &s;hould be capable of Rea&s;on like them: Nay more, added they, were it an Animal that re|&s;embled our &s;hape &s;omewhat more, it were &s;omewhat; but of all things the mo&s;t un|like, and mo&s;t hideous. In a word, a bald Bea&s;t, a featherle&s;s Bird, a Chimera patched up of all &s;orts of Natures, and terrible to all. Man, I &s;ay, &s;o vain and fooli&s;h, that he per&s;wades him&s;elf, we were only made for him.

Man, who maintains that there is no Rea&s;oning, but with a reference to the Sen&s;es; and yet has the weake&s;t, dulle&s;t and mo&s;t erring Sen&s;es of all Creatures living. Man, in fine, whom Nature hath
<PB N="104" REF="127"> formed as &s;he doth Mon&s;ters, to &s;hew her skill; and yet hath filled with the Ambi|tion of domineering over, and extirpating all other Animals.</P>
<P>This was the di&s;cour&s;e that the wi&s;er &s;ort held; as for the Rabble they cried, That it was a horrid thing, to believe that a Bea&s;t who had not a Face like theirs, &s;hould have Rea&s;on. Now, chattered they one to another, he hath neither Beak, Feathers nor Claws, and can he have a Spiritual Soul? Strange! what Imperti|nence is that!</P>
<P>Though the more generous pittyed me, yet that hindered not, but that an Indite|ment was brought in again&s;t me; all the Writings were drawn upon the Bark of a Cypre&s;s Tree: And then &s;ome Days after, I was carried before the Tribunal of Birds. There were none cho&s;en for Advo|cates, Coun&s;ellors and Judges of the Court, but Magpys, Jays, and Starlings; becau&s;e they would have none but tho&s;e that under|&s;tood my Language. In&s;tead of trying me at the Bar, they &s;et me &s;tradling upon a Stump of a rotten Tree; where he that was Pre&s;i|dent of the Court, having chattered two or three times with his Beak, and Maje&s;ti|cally &s;hrugged his Feathers, asked me, From whence I came, of what nation and kind I was? My charitable Magpy had given
<PB N="105" REF="127"> me &s;ome In&s;tructions before, which were very u&s;eful to me; and among&s;t other, that I &s;hould have a &s;pecial care, not to confe&s;s that I was a Man. I made an|&s;wer then, That I was of that little World which is called the Earth, that the Phe|nix, and &s;ome others whom I &s;aw in Court, might have told them of: That the Climat where I was born, lay under the tempe|rate Zone of the Artick Pole, in the utmo&s;t part of
<HI>Europe,</HI> which was called <HI>France;</HI> and that as to my kind, I was not a Man, as they imagined, but an Ape: That &s;ome Men had carried me away very young out of the Cradle, and brought me up among&s;t them: That their bad Breeding had ren|dered my skin &s;o delicate; that they made me forget my Mother's Tongue, and taught me theirs: That to comply with the&s;e Wild Animals, I had accu&s;tomed my &s;elf to walk only on two Legs: And that, in a word, &s;ince it is more ea&s;ie to degene|rate than to improve in kind, the Opi|nion, Cu&s;tom, and Food of the&s;e un|clean Bea&s;ts, had &s;o much power up|on me, that hardly my Parents, who are Apes of Quality, could them&s;elves know me. I added for my Ju&s;tification, that they might have me viewed by expert Birds, and that in ca&s;e they found me to be a Man, I &s;hould be willing to be annihilated as a Mon&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="128"> Gentlemen, cried a Swallow of the Court, &s;o &s;oon as I had made an end, I hold him as convicted: You have not for|got that ju&s;t now he &s;aid, That the Coun|try where he was born, was <HI>France;</HI> but you know that the Apes in <HI>France</HI> do not engender: Judge now after that, if he be what he boa&s;ts him&s;elf to be.</P>
<P>I made an&s;wer to my Accu&s;er, That I was carried away &s;o young out of the Bo&s;om of my Parents, and Tran&s;ported into
<HI>France,</HI> that I had rea&s;on to call that my native Country which I remembred be&s;t.</P>
<P>That rea&s;on though &s;pecious, was not &s;ufficient; but the mo&s;t part being ravi&s;h|ed to hear, that I was not a Man, were very willing to believe it &s;o: For tho&s;e who had never &s;een any, could not be per&s;wa|ded, but that a Man was a far more hor|rid Creature, than I appeared to be to them; and the di&s;creeter added, That a Man was &s;o abominable a thing, that it were good they &s;hould believe him to be only an ima|ginary Being.</P>
<P>All the Court clapt their Wings for Joy, and immediatly I was commited to the Al|dermen-Birds to be examined, on condition they &s;hould pre&s;ent me again next Morning, and at the opening of the Court, make report of the Verdict of the Jury. They undertook the Affair then, and carried me
<PB N="107" REF="128"> into a Bye-copice: Whil&s;t they kept me there, they did nothing but play a hundred Monkey tricks about me; &s;ometimes they knocked their Feet one again&s;t another, by and by they dug little Holes, only that they might fill them up again; and then all of a &s;udden I was amazed that I could &s;ee no Body at all.</P>
<P>The Day and Night were &s;pent in the&s;e trifles, until next Morning, that the hour appointed being come, they brought me to appear again before my Judges: Where my Syndicks being de&s;ired to tell the truth, an&s;wered, That to di&s;charge their Con|&s;ciences, they thought them&s;elves obliged to inform the Court, That for certain I was not an Ape, as I bragg'd: For, &s;aid they, it was to no purpo&s;e for us to leap, skip, whirl round, and invent before him a hundred odd Tricks and Capers, whereby we thought to move him to do the like, according to the cu&s;tom of Apes, when all would not do. Now though he hath been bred among&s;t Men, &s;eeing an Ape is always an Ape, we maintain that it could not have been in his power, to refrain from imitating our Api&s;h Tricks. This, Gen|tlemen, is our Report.</P>
<P>The Judges at that drew near to give their Opinions; but they perceived that the Sky was overca&s;t and charged with
<PB N="108" REF="129"> Clouds, which made them break up the Court.</P>
<P>I imagined that the appearance of bad Weather inclined them to do &s;o.</P>
<P>When the Attorney-General by order of Court came, and gave me intimation, That they would not pa&s;s Sentence on me that Day; that they never determined a criminal Proce&s;s, when the Sky was not &s;erene; becau&s;e they were afraid, that the bad temper of the Air, might work &s;ome alteration in the good Con&s;titution of the minds of the Judges; that the peevi&s;h temper the Birds are in, during Rain, might influence the Cau&s;e: Or, in a word, that the Court might revenge their Sadne&s;s up|on the Pri&s;oner; and therefore it was, that my Sentence was deferr'd till fairer Wea|ther. I was carried back to Pri&s;on then, and I remember that in the way my cha|ritable Magpy never for&s;ook me; &s;he kept flying all along by my &s;ide, and I believe &s;he would never have left me, had not her Companions drawn near to us.</P>
<P>At length I arrived at the place of my Pri&s;on, where, during, my Captivity, I had no other Food but the King's Bread; for &s;o they call half a hundred Worms, and as many Maggots, that every &s;even hours they brought me to eat.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="129"> I thought that I &s;hould have appeared again next day, and every Body thought &s;o too; but one of my Keepers told me, at the end of five or &s;ix Days, that all that time had been employed, in rendring Ju|&s;tice to a Society of Gold-finches, who had complained of one of their number. I asked my Keeper, What crime that poor Wretch had been accu&s;ed of? Of the mo&s;t enormous, replied my Keeper, that a Bird can be a&s;per&s;ed with. They accu&s;e it&mdash; can you believe it? They accu&s;e it&mdash; but good Gods! the very thoughts of it makes my Feathers to &s;tand an end! In a word, they accu&s;e it, that during the &s;pace of Six Years, it hath not as yet de|&s;erved to have a Friend; and therefore it hath been condemned to be a King, and a King of a People that differ from it in kind.</P>
<P>Had its Subjects been of its own na|ture, it might at lea&s;t have beguiled its Eyes and De&s;ire with their Plea&s;ures: But &s;eeing the plea&s;ures of one kind, have no relation to tho&s;e of another, it will &s;up|port all the fatigues, and ta&s;t all the bitter|ne&s;s of Royalty, and never be able to reli&s;h the plea&s;ures thereof in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>They have &s;ent it away this Morning, accompanied with a great many Phy&s;iti|ans, to take heed that it do not poi&s;on it &s;elf by the way.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="130"> Though my Keeper was naturally a great Talker, yet he dur&s;t not entertain me any longer in di&s;cour&s;e, for fear of being &s;u&s;pected of Intelligence with me.</P>
<P>About the end of the Week, I was again brought before my Judges.</P>
<P>They re&s;ted me upon the breech of a lit|tle Tree without Leaves.</P>
<P>All the Birds of the Long-Robe, as well Advocates, Coun&s;ellors, as Judges, and Pre|&s;idents, roo&s;ted by Stories, every one ac|cording to his Dignity, on the Top of a tall Cedar: For the re&s;t who were only pre&s;ent out of Curio&s;ity, they placed them|&s;elves promi&s;cuou&s;ly till all the Seats were full, that's to &s;ay, till the Branches of the Cedar were covered with Feet.</P>
<P>The Magpy, in whom I ob&s;erved all along &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion for me, came and perched upon my Tree, where pretend|ing to divert her &s;elf by pecking the Mo&s;s: Really, &s;aid &s;he to me, you cannot believe how much I am concerned at your Misfor|tune; for though I am not ignorant that among&s;t the Living, a Man is a Plague, that ought to be purged out of all well-go|vern'd States; yet when I call to mind, that I was bred among&s;t them from the Cradle, that I have learned their Language &s;o per|fectly, that I had almo&s;t forgot mine own; and that. I have eaten out of their Hands
<PB N="111" REF="130"> &s;uch excellent Green Chee&s;e, I cannot think on't, but that it brings Water in|to my Eyes and Mouth; I have &s;o great a kindne&s;s for you, that I cannot incline to the right &s;ide.</P>
<P>She had gone on &s;o far, when we were interrupted by the coming of an Eagle, that lighted among&s;t the Branches of a Tree, pretty near to mine. I was about to have ri&s;en and fallen upon my knees before the Eagle, thinking he had been the King, if my Magpy with her Foot had not held me fa&s;t in my Seat. Did you think, &s;aid &s;he, that that great Eagle had been our Sovereign? That's an Imagination of you Men, who becau&s;e you &s;uffer your &s;elves to be commanded by the greate&s;t, the &s;tronge&s;t, and the mo&s;t cruel of your Companions, have fooli&s;hly thought, judging of all things according to your own mea&s;ures, that the Eagle ought to command us.</P>
<P>But our Politicks are quite different, for we never chu&s;e for our Kings, but the Weake&s;t, the Wilde&s;t, and mo&s;t Peace|able: Nay, and we change them every Six Months, and pitch upon the Weak, to the end, that the meane&s;t among&s;t us, who may have been wronged by him, may take his Revenge. We chu&s;e the Mild, to the end he neither hate, or be hated of
<PB N="112" REF="131"> any Body; and we would have him to be of a Peaceful Temper, for avoiding of War, the Sink of all Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Once every Week he holds a Parlia|ment, where all are received to propo&s;e their Grievances again&s;t him. If there be but three Birds only di&s;&s;atisfied with his Government, out he goes, and they pro|ceed to a new Election.</P>
<P>All that Day the Parliament &s;its, our King is mounted on the top of a high Yew-Tree, upon the brink of a Lake, bound Feet and Wings. All the Birds one after another pa&s;s before him; and if any of them know him to be guilty of a Crime that de&s;erves death, he may throw him into the Water; but he mu&s;t upon the &s;pot, ju&s;tifie the fact by good Rea&s;ons, o|therwi&s;e he is Condemned to the &s;aid Death.</P>
<P>I could not forbear to interrupt, and ask her, what &s;he meant by the &s;aid Death? And this is the An&s;wer &s;he made me:</P>
<P>When the Crime of a Malefactor is judged to be &s;o enormous, that an ordinary Death is not &s;ufficient to expiate it, they endea|vour to chu&s;e one that contains the pain of many; and in this manner they proceed to it:</P>
<P>Tho&s;e among&s;t us that have the mo&s;t melancholick and doleful Tone, are &s;ent
<PB N="113" REF="131"> to the Malefactor, who is carried upon a di&s;mal Cypre&s;s. There the&s;e &s;ad Mu&s;ici|ans gather about him, and by the Ear fill his Soul with &s;uch tragical and doleful Notes, that the bitterne&s;s of his Sorrow di&s;ordering the Oeconomy of his Organs, and pre&s;&s;ing his Heart, he pines away to the &s;ight, and dies choaked with Sadne&s;s.</P>
<P>However &s;uch a &s;pectacle never hap|pens; for &s;eeing our Kings are exceeding mild, they never force any Body to incur &s;o cruel a Death, upon the account of Re|venge.</P>
<P>He that at pre&s;ent Reigns is a Dove, who is of &s;o peaceable a temper, that t'o|ther day, when two Sparrows were to be made Friends, it was the harde&s;t thing in the World, to make him conceive what Enmity was.</P>
<P>My Magpy could not continue &s;o long a di&s;cour&s;e, without being ob&s;erved by &s;ome of the By-&s;tanders; and becau&s;e &s;he was already &s;u&s;pected of &s;ome Intelligence with me, the chief of the A&s;&s;embly made one of the Eagles of my guard, catch her by the Neck, and make &s;ure of her Per|&s;on. King Dove arrived in the mean while; all were &s;ilent, and the fir&s;t thing that was heard, was the complaint of the great Cen&s;or of the Birds, which he made again&s;t the Magpy. The King be|ing
<PB N="114" REF="132"> fully informed of the Scandal &s;he had given, asked her her Name, and how &s;he came to know me? Sir, an&s;wered &s;he, all in amaze, My name is <HI>Magget,</HI> there are here a great many Birds of Quality, that will vouch for me. One day in the World of the Earth, of which I am a Native, I was informed by <HI>Chirpper</HI> the Po&s;y there, (who having heard me cry in my Cage, came to vi|&s;it me at the Window where I hung,) that my Father was
<HI>Bobb-tail,</HI> and my Mother <HI>Crack-nuts:</HI> I had not known &s;o much but for him; for I was carried away very Young, from under the Wings of my Pa|rents; my Mother &s;ome time after died of Grief; and my Father, being then pa&s;t the Age of having any more Children, de&s;pairing to &s;ee him&s;elf without Heirs, went to the War of the Jays, where he was killed by a peck in the brain. They that carried me away were certain wild Animals, whom they call Hog-herds; who had me to be &s;old at a Ca&s;tle, where I &s;aw that Man who now &s;tands upon his Tryal. I cannot tell, whe|ther he conceived any Kindne&s;s for me, but he took the pains to cau&s;e the Servants to cut meat for me; he had &s;ometimes the good|ne&s;s to prepare it for me him&s;elf. If I catcht cold in the Winter, he carried me to the Fire, lined my Cage, or ordered the Gardiner to warm me in his Bo&s;om.
<PB N="115" REF="132"> The Servants dur&s;t not vex me in his pre|&s;ence: and one day I remember, he &s;aved me from the Jaws of the Cat, who held me in her Paws, to which my Lady's little Page had expo&s;ed me; but it will not be impertinent, to tell you the Cau&s;e of that Barbarity. To comply with
<HI>Verdelet</HI> (for that was the Page's name,) I was chatte|ring one day &s;ome idle words that he had taught me. Now it happened, as ill Luck would have it, though I always repeated my Le&s;&s;ons in cour&s;e, that I came to &s;ay in order, ju&s;t as he came in to deliver a Me&s;&s;age, <HI>Be quiet, you Son of a Whore, you lye.</HI> The Man there that &s;tands Indicted, who knowing the Rogue to be naturally given to Lying, imagined, that I might very well have &s;poken by Prophecy, and &s;ent to the place to know, if
<HI>Verdelet</HI> had been there: <HI>Verdelet</HI> was convinced of his Knavery, <HI>Verdelet</HI> was whipt, and <HI>Ver|delet</HI> in revenge, would have had me de|voured by <HI>Maulkin.</HI> The King by a Nod of the head &s;hew'd, that he was &s;atisfied with the Pity that &s;he had conceived for my di&s;a&s;ter: However he di&s;charged her to &s;peak any more to me in private. Then he asked my Adver&s;ary's Council, if his Plea was ready? He made a &s;ign with his Foot, that he was going to &s;peak, and if I mi&s;take it not, the&s;e are
<PB N="116" REF="133"> the Points whereon he in&s;i&s;ted again&s;t me:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Plea brought in the Parliament of Birds, A&s;&s;embled against an Ani|mal, accu&s;ed of being a Man.</HEAD>
<P>Gentlemen, The Plaintiff is <HI>Guillemot</HI> the Fle&s;hy, a Partridge by extraction, late|ly arrived from the World of the Earth, his Brea&s;t &s;till gaping by a &s;hot that he hath received from Men; Demandant a|gain&s;t all Mankind, and by con&s;equence a|gain&s;t an Animal, whom I pretend to be a member of that great Body. It would be no hard matter for us, to hinder, by his death, the Violences that he can commit: Neverthele&s;s, &s;eeing the Pre&s;ervation or Lo&s;s of every thing that has breath, con|cerns the Common-Wealth of the Living, I think we &s;hould de&s;erve to have been made Men, that's to &s;ay, Degraded from Rea|&s;on and Immortality, which we enjoy above them, had we re&s;embled them in any unju&s;t Action like theirs.</P>
<P>Let us examine then, Gentlemen, the Difficulties of this Cau&s;e, with all the Ap|plication that our divine minds are capa|ble of.</P>
<P>The &s;tre&s;s of the matter lies here, to wit, Whether or not this Animal be a Man?
<PB N="117" REF="133"> and then in ca&s;e we make it out, that he is, whether or not he de&s;erves Death for that?</P>
<P>For my part, I make no doubt but that he is; in the fir&s;t place, Becau&s;e he is &s;o impudent as to tell a Lye, in maintaining that he is not; in the &s;econd place, Becau&s;e he laughs like a Fool; thirdly, In that he weeps like a Sot; fourthly, In that he blows his No&s;e like a na&s;ty Villain; fifthly, In that he is Feathered but in part; &s;ixth|ly, In that he carries his Tail before; &s;e|venthly, In that he hath always a great ma|ny little &s;quare Bones in his Mouth, which he has neither the wit to &s;pit out, nor &s;wal|low down; eighthly and la&s;tly, Becau&s;e every Morning he lifts up his Eyes, his No&s;e, and large Snout, claps his open Hands clo&s;e together, which he points up to Hea|ven, joins them into one piece, as if it troubled him to have two at liberty; breaks his Legs &s;hort off by the middle, &s;o that he falls upon his Geegots; and then by Magical words that he mutters, I have ob&s;erved, That his broken Legs are knit again, and that he ri&s;es up as gay as he was before. Now, you know, Gentlemen, that among&s;t all Animals, none but Man has &s;o black a Soul, as to be given to Magick, and by con&s;equence I conclude, That this is a Man: We are
<PB N="118" REF="134"> now to enquire, whether or not, as Man, he de&s;erves to be put to death.</P>
<P>I think, Gentlemen, it never was yet doubted, but that all Creatures are pro|duced by our common Mother, to live together in Society. Now if I prove, that Man &s;eems to be Born only to break it; &s;hall I not make it out, that he going con|trary to the end of his Creation, de&s;erves that Nature &s;hould repent her &s;elf of her work?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and fundamental Law, for the maintenance of a Republick, is Equa|lity: But Man cannot endure it to Eter|nity; he falls upon us that he may eat us; he per&s;wades him&s;elf that we were only made for his u&s;e; he makes the Barbarity, wherewith he ma&s;&s;acres us, and the &s;mall Re&s;i&s;tance he finds on our &s;ide, an Argu|ment of his pretended Superiority: And neverthele&s;s wo'nt own Eagles, Condores, and Griffins, who are too hard for the &s;tronge&s;t Man, to be his Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould that great Size, and conformation of Members, make the di|ver&s;ity of Kind, &s;eeing there are Dwarffs and Giants to be found among&s;t Men them|&s;elves?</P>
<P>Nay more, that Empire wherewith they flatter them&s;elves, is but an imaginary Right: On the contrary, they are &s;o incli|nable
<PB N="119" REF="134"> to Servitude, that lea&s;t they &s;hould not &s;erve, they fell one another for Slaves. In this manner, the Young are Slaves to the Old, the Poor to the Rich, the Clowns to the Gentlemen, the Princes to the Monarchs, and the Monarchs them&s;elves to the Laws which they have E&s;tabli&s;hed. And be|&s;ides all that, the poor Drudges are &s;o a|fraid to be without Ma&s;ters, that as if they apprehended, that Liberty might come to them from &s;ome unexpected place; they frame to them&s;elves Gods in all parts, in the Water, in the Air, in the Fire, and under the Earth; they'll make them of Wood, rather than want; nay, I fancy al|&s;o that they tickle them&s;elves with the vain hopes of Immortality, not &s;o much out of a Horrour, that they have of being annihilated, as for fear that they may have none to command them after their death. Here's the fine effect of that fanta&s;tical Monarchy, and of that natural Empire of Man, as they would have it, over the Ani|mals, nay and over us too; for he has been &s;o in&s;olent, as even to pretend to that. In the mean while, in con&s;equence of that ri|diculous Principality, he fairly takes to him&s;elf the power of Life and Death over us; he lays &s;nares for us, chains us, claps us up in Pri&s;on, kills us, eats us; and makes the power of killing tho&s;e which re|main
<PB N="120" REF="135"> free, a mark of Nobility: He thinks that the Sun is lighted on purpo&s;e to let him &s;ee how to make War again&s;t us; that Na|ture hath only &s;uffered us to take our turns in the Air, that from our flight he may draw lucky or unlucky Au&s;pices; and that when God put Entrails into our Bodies, his intention only was, to make a great Book, wherein Man might learn the Science of future Contingencies.</P>
<P>Good, then, is not this un&s;upportable Pride? Could any that's guilty of it, de|&s;erve a le&s;s puni&s;hment, than to be made a Man? However, I don't in&s;i&s;t upon this as a rea&s;on, why ye &s;hould condemn this Man: The poor Bea&s;t wanting the u&s;e of Rea&s;on that we have, I excu&s;e tho&s;e errors of his, that proceed from want of Judgment; but for &s;uch as are only the Daughters of his Will, I demand Ju&s;tice. For in&s;tance, in that he kills us, though we do not attack him; in that he eats us, when he may &s;a|tisfie his hunger with more convenient Food; and what I e&s;teem the ba&s;e&s;t of all, in that he debauches the good nature of &s;ome of our Brethren, as of Lanners, Faulcons and Vultures, by teaching them to murder tho&s;e of their kind, and to feed on their fellow Creatures alive; or to de|liver us up into his clutches.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="135"> That alone is &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a Con&s;iderati|on, that I beg the Court he may be di&s;|patched by the &s;ad Death.</P>
<P>The whole Bench &s;hivered for horror at &s;o terrible a Puni&s;hment; and therefore that they might have ground to moderate it, the King made a Sign to the Coun|cil, that was a&s;&s;igned me, to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>This was a Starling, and a great Lawyer, who having three times &s;tampt with his Foot, upon the Branch he &s;at on, &s;pake to the Court in this manner:</P>
<P>It is true, Gentlemen, that moved with Pity, I undertook the defence of that un|fortunate Bea&s;t; but ju&s;t as I was about to Plead, I felt a remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, and, as it were, a &s;ecret Voice, that hath for|bidden me to fulfil &s;o dete&s;table a Re&s;olu|tion: So that, Gentlemen, I declare to you, and the whole Court, That for the Salvation of my Soul, I'll not contribute in any manner, to the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch a Mon&s;ter, as Man is.</P>
<P>The whole Mobile clacked with the Beak, in &s;ign of Joy, and to congratu|late the Sincerity of &s;o Con&s;cientious a Bird.</P>
<P>My Magpy offered to Plead for me in place of the other, for it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to be heard; becau&s;e that being bred among&s;t Men, and perhaps, infected with
<PB N="122" REF="136"> their Morality; it was to be feared, that &s;he would manage the Cau&s;e, with a pre|judicated Mind; for the Court of Birds, never &s;uffer a Lawyer, that concerns him&s;elf more for the one Client, than for the other, to be heard; unle&s;s he make it appear, That that Inclination proceeds from the Parties being in the Right.</P>
<P>When my Judges &s;aw, that no Body ap|peared in my defence, they &s;tretched out and &s;hook their Wings, and immediately flew to Voting.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part, as I was informed fince, in&s;i&s;ted hard, that I &s;hould be di&s;|patched by the &s;ad Death; but neverthe|le&s;s, when they perceived that the King inclined to Clemency, all joined with him in Opinion. Thus my Judges moderated them&s;elves, and in&s;tead of the &s;ad Death, which they excu&s;ed me from, they thought it convenient, that my Puni&s;hment might quadrate with &s;ome of my Crimes, and I de&s;troyed by a Death, which might &s;erve to undeceive me, of that pretended Em|pire of Man, over the Birds, which I bragg'd of, that I &s;hould be abandoned to the weake&s;t of tho&s;e that are carried by Wings; my meaning is, That they Con|demned me to be eaten up by Flies.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Court broke up, and I heard a whi&s;per, that they had not
<PB N="123" REF="136"> enlarged in Specifying the particular Cir|cum&s;tances of my Tragedy, becau&s;e of an accident that happened to a Bird, who ju&s;t as he was about to &s;peak to the King, had fallen into a &s;woon. It was thought to have been occa&s;ioned, by the Horrour that had &s;eized him, in looking too &s;ted|fa&s;tly upon a Man: And therefore I was ordered to be carried away.</P>
<P>But my Sentence was pronounced fir&s;t; and as &s;oon as the O&s;pray, which officiated as Clerk to the A&s;&s;i&s;es, had made an end of reading it to me, I perceived all about the Sky blackened with Flies, Drones, Bees, Gnats and Muskettoes, which hum|med for impatience.</P>
<P>I expected that my Eagles &s;hould have come and carried me away after the u&s;ual manner; but in place of them a great black O&s;tridge came, that ignominiou&s;ly &s;et me &s;tradling upon his back; for a|mong&s;t them, that's the mo&s;t di&s;graceful po&s;ture a Malefactor can be put into; and no Bird for what offence &s;oever, can be Condemned to it.</P>
<P>The Officers that waited on me to Exe|cution, were half a hundred Condores, and as many Griffins in the van; after whom came flying &s;oftly, a proce&s;&s;ion of Ravens, that croaked I know not what mournful Ditty; and I fancy that I heard
<PB N="124" REF="137"> as at a greater di&s;tance, a Chorus of Owls, that an&s;wered them.</P>
<P>As we parted from the place where I had received Sentence, Two Birds of Pa|radice, who had orders to a&s;&s;i&s;t me at my Death, came and &s;at on my Shoulders.</P>
<P>Though my Soul, at that time, was ve|ry heavy and di&s;compo&s;ed, by rea&s;on of the lamentable Condition I was in; yet I remember, in a manner, all the Rea&s;ons they made u&s;e of to comfort me.</P>
<P>Death, &s;aid they to me, (putting their Beak to my Far,) without doubt is no great Evil, &s;eeing Nature our good Mo|ther &s;ubjects all her Children unto it; and it ought not to be a matter of great Con|&s;equence, &s;ince it happens at all times, and for the lea&s;t things: For if Life were &s;o ex|cellent, it would not be in our power, not to give it; or if Death were atten|ded by con&s;equences of Importance, as thou imagine&s;t, it would not be in our power to give it: There is a great deal of appearance to the contrary, &s;eeing the Ani|mal begins by play, and ends at the &s;ame rate. I &s;peak to thee in this manner, be|cau&s;e thy Soul not being immortal as ours is, thou maye&s;t very well conclude, That when thou die&s;t, all dies with thee. Let it not trouble thee then, that thou doe&s;t a little &s;ooner, what &s;ome of thy fel|lows
<PB N="125" REF="137"> will do e're it be long: Their con|dition is more deplorable than thine; for if Death be an evil, it is only Evil to tho&s;e who are to die: And in re&s;pect of thee, who ha&s;t not above an hour betwixt here and there; they &s;hall be Fifty or Sixty Years in a &s;tate of dying; and be&s;ides, mind me, he that is not born is not unhappy. Now thou art going to be like him that is not born: In a twinkling of an Eye, when thou art out of this Life, thou &s;halt be what thou wa&s;t a twinkling of an Eye before; and that twinkling of an Eye be|ing over, thou &s;halt be as long dead, as he that died a Thou&s;and Ages ago: But make the wor&s;t on't; &s;uppo&s;e Life be a Ble&s;&s;ing, the &s;ame Accident, that in the infinite &s;paces of time hath made thee to be; may it not &s;ome time or other, make thee once more to be again? Matter, which by various mixtures, arrived at length to that Number, Di&s;po&s;ition and Order, nece&s;&s;ary for the Con&s;truction of thy Being; may it not, by mixing again of new, attain to a Di&s;po&s;i|tion requi&s;ite for bringing thee once more again into Being? Yes, it may; but thou'lt &s;ay to me, I &s;hall not remember that I have been. Ha! dear Brother, what does that concern thee, provided thou finde&s;t thy &s;elf in Be|ing? And then may it not be, that to com|fort thee for the lo&s;s of thy Life, thou'lt
<PB N="126" REF="138"> imagine the &s;ame Rea&s;ons which I at pre|&s;ent propo&s;e to thee?</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations are weighty enough to make thee patiently drink that bitter Po|tion; yet I have others more pre&s;&s;ing &s;till, which will without doubt incline thee to wi&s;h for it. Thou mu&s;t be per&s;waded, Brother, that as thou and the re&s;t of Brutes are material, and that as Death, in&s;tead of annihilating Matter, does only trouble the Oeconomy thereof; &s;o thou oughte&s;t, I &s;ay, certainly to believe, that cea&s;ing to be what now thou art, thou'lt begin to be &s;omething el&s;e. Grant then, that thou only become a clod of Earth, or a Pibble, thou'lt &s;till be &s;omewhat le&s;s wicked than Man. But I have a Secret to di&s;cover to thee, which I would not any of my Com|panions &s;hould hear from my Mouth, and that is, That being Eaten, as thou art going to be, by our little Birds, thou'lt pa&s;s into their Sub&s;tance; yes, thou'lt have the honour to contribute, though blindly, to the Intellectual operations of our Flyes, and &s;hare of this Glory, that if thou rea|&s;one&s;t not thy &s;elf, thou'lt make them at lea&s;t to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>About this part of the Exhortation, we arrived at the place appointed for my Exe|cution.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="138"> There were Four Trees very near, and in a manner equally di&s;tant one from ano|ther, on every one of which at a paralel height, a great Heron perched. They took me down from the Black O&s;tridge, and a great many Cormorants lifted me up to the place where the Herons were. The&s;e Birds being oppo&s;ite to one another, and firmly perched on their &s;everal Trees, with their prodigious long Necks, as with a Cord, twi&s;ted about me, the one about my Arms, the other about my Legs, and bound me &s;o fa&s;t, that though every one of the&s;e members was only tied by a &s;ingle Neck, yet it was not in my power, to wag or &s;tir in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>They were to continue a long while in that po&s;ture; for I heard orders given to tho&s;e Cormorants that lifted me up, to go and fi&s;h for the Herons, and to &s;lide their Foot into their Beaks.</P>
<P>The Flies were &s;till expected, becau&s;e they could not fly &s;o fa&s;t as we had done; however it was not very long before they were heard.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing they exploited, was to di&s;tribute my Body among them into &s;e|veral Provinces; and that Di&s;tribution was &s;o maliciou&s;ly made, that my Eyes were a&s;&s;igned to the Bees, to the end they might Sting them out as they fed on them;
<PB N="128" REF="139"> my Ears to the Beetles and Drones, that they might &s;tum and devour them at the &s;ame time; my Shoulders to the Musket|toes, to the end, they might make me itch with their Bitings; and &s;o of the re&s;t. No &s;ooner had I heard them &s;ettle their Orders, but that immediately I &s;aw them approach. All the Atoms and Motes in the Sun, &s;eemed to be converted into Flies; for &s;carcely was I vi&s;ited with two or three faint Beams of Light, that &s;eemed by &s;tealth to reach me, &s;o clo&s;e were the&s;e Battalions, and &s;o near my Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>But as every one of them was greedily chu&s;ing the place where he was to bite, I perceived them to recoyle briskly all of a &s;udden; and amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of an infinite number of Shouts, that made the Clouds re&s;ound again; I &s;everal times di&s;tingui&s;hed the word Pardon, Pardon, Pardon.</P>
<P>Afterward Two Turtle Doves drew near to me; at their approach, all the gha&s;tly Preparatives for my Death were di&s;&s;ipated: I felt my Herons let loo&s;e the twi&s;ts of their long Necks, wherewith I was begirt, and my Body extended in form of a St. <HI>Andrew's</HI>-cro&s;s, &s;lide from the Top of the Four Trees, down to their very Roots.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="139"> I expected no le&s;s from my fall, than to be brui&s;ed by &s;ome Stone in the Ground; but when my fear was over, I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, to find my &s;elf decently &s;eated upon a White O&s;tridge, who fell a galloping, &s;o &s;oon as he felt me upon his Back.</P>
<P>They made me take another way, than the way I came; for I remember that I cro&s;&s;|ed a great Wood of Myrtles, and another of Turpentine Trees, adjoining to a va&s;t For|re&s;t of Olive Trees, where King Dove in the middle of his Court &s;taid for me.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as he perceived me, he gave a &s;ign that they &s;hould help me to get down. Immediately Two Eagles of the Guard, gave me their Talons, and carried me to their Prince.</P>
<P>I would in honour, have embraced and ki&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's little Claws, but he drew back: And I ask you the que&s;tion, &s;aid he fir&s;t, If you know that Bird?</P>
<P>At the&s;e words they &s;hewed me a Parrot, who began to turn round and clap his Wings, when he perceived that I con&s;ide|red him: Yes, I fancy, cried I to the King, that I have &s;een him &s;omewhere; but Fear and Joy have &s;o confounded my Memory, that I cannot as yet call di&s;tinctly to mind, where it has been.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="140"> With that the Parrot came, and embra|cing my Face with its Wings, &s;aid to me, How! do'nt you know <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> then, your Cou&s;ins Parrot, which hath &s;o often given you the occa&s;ion, to maintain that Birds u&s;ed Rea&s;on? It is I who ju&s;t now had a mind, after your Tryal was over, to de|clare the obligations I have to you; but grief to &s;ee you in &s;o great danger, made me fall into a Swoon. His di&s;cour&s;e ful|ly opened my Eyes, and having known him perfectly, I embraced and ki&s;&s;ed him, and he embraced and ki&s;&s;ed me. Is it thee, then &s;aid I, my poor
<HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who&s;e Cage I opened to give thee thy Liberty, that the Tyrannical Cu&s;tom of our World deprived thee of?</P>
<P>The King interrupted our Care&s;&s;es, and &s;poke to me in this manner: Man, with us a good Action is never lo&s;t; and therefore it is that, tho as being a Man, thou de|&s;erve&s;t to die, only becau&s;e thou wa&s;t Born, yet the Senate gives thee thy Life. It's fit we &s;hould thus acknowledge tho&s;e Notices, wherewith Nature enlightened thine In&s;tinct, when it gave thee a Fore|ta&s;t of that Rea&s;on in us, which thou wa&s;t not capable of under&s;tanding. Go then in Peace, and live Joyfully.</P>
<P>He gave &s;ome orders in private, and my White O&s;tridge, conducted by the Two
<PB N="131" REF="140"> Turtle Doves, carried me out of the A&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P>My Bird having galloped with me a|bout twelve hours, left me near to a Fore&s;t, into which I went &s;o &s;oon as it was gone. There I began to ta&s;t the Plea&s;ure of Li|berty, and of feeding on the Honey, which di&s;tilled down the Bark of the Trees.</P>
<P>I fancy that I &s;hould never have made an end of my Walk, (for the agreable Varieties of the place, pre&s;ented always &s;ome new thing more delightful to my Eyes,) had my Body been able to hold out: But &s;eeing I found my &s;elf at length wholly overcome with Weari&s;omne&s;s, I &s;oftly laid my &s;elf down upon the Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Lying thus &s;tretched out under the &s;ha|dow of the Trees, I found my &s;elf invited to Sleep, by the fre&s;h Air and Solitude of the Place; when a humming noi&s;e of con|fu&s;ed Voices, which &s;eemed to &s;ound about my Ears, made me awake with a &s;tart.</P>
<P>The ground appeared to be very level and &s;mooth, without the lea&s;t Bu&s;h that might intercept the Sight; and therefore my Pro&s;pect reached far among&s;t the Trees of the Fore&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, the Mur|murring that I heard, could not be but very near me; &s;o that li&s;tning to it more attentively, I very di&s;tinctly heard a par|cel
<PB N="132" REF="141"> of <HI>Greek</HI> Words; and among&s;t &s;everal that di&s;cour&s;ed together, one who &s;pake to this purpo&s;e,</P>
<P>Doctor, one of my Allies, <HI>Elm</HI> with Three Heads, hath ju&s;t now &s;ent me a Chaffinch, to acquaint me that he is Sick of an Hectick Feaver, and of a Scurffy Mo&s;s, wherewith he is covered from Head to Foot. I beg of you for all Love, that you would be plea&s;ed to order him &s;ome|what.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time I heard no more; but af|ter a little intermi&s;&s;ion, I thought I heard one make this reply: Though <HI>Elm</HI> with Three Heads, were none of your Allies; and though in&s;tead of you who are my Friend, the greate&s;t Stranger of all our kind, &s;hould de&s;ire the &s;ame thing of me, I would grant it; for my Profe&s;&s;ion ob|liges me to a&s;&s;i&s;t every Body. You &s;hall therefore acquaint <HI>Elm</HI> with Three Heads, That for the Cure of his Di&s;temper, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that he Suck in as much humide, and as little dry Nouri&s;hment, as po&s;&s;ibly he can; that for that end he ought to di|rect the little Fibres of his Root, towards the moi&s;te&s;t place of his Bed: That he mu&s;t keep him&s;elf Merry and Chearful, and daily be diverted by a con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick, of &s;ome excellent Nightingals. You'll hear from him afterwards, how he finds
<PB N="133" REF="141"> him&s;elf, with that cour&s;e of living; and then according to the Progre&s;s of his Di|&s;temper, when we have prepared his Hu|mours, &s;ome Stork of his Friends &s;hall from me give him a Gli&s;ter, that will fully reco|ver him.</P>
<P>The&s;e words being ended, I heard not the lea&s;t noi&s;e more; till about a quarter of an hour after, that a voice which I fancy I had not ob&s;erved before, came to my Ears, and &s;pake in this manner, <HI>Hola, Gaffer Forked Trunk,</HI> what, do ye Sleep? I heard another voice that thus replied, No, <HI>Fre&s;h-bark,</HI> why? Becau&s;e, &s;aid the fir&s;t that &s;pake, I find the &s;ame Emotion in me, that commonly we do, when the&s;e Animals they call Men, come near us; and I would ask you, if you feel the &s;ame thing?</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before the other made An&s;wer; as if he intended to employ the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite of his Sen&s;es in that Di&s;co|very; but at length he cried out: Good God, you are in the right, and I &s;wear to you I find my Organs &s;o full of the Ideas of a Man, that I am the mo&s;t mi&s;taken in the world, if there be not one very near to this place: At that time there was a mixt noi&s;e of voices that &s;aid, they &s;melt out a Man.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="142"> It was in vain for me to look about on all hands; I could not di&s;cover whence that word could come: At length being a little recovered from the Horror, whereinto that accident had ca&s;t me; I made an&s;wer to the voice, which I took to be that which had asked, if there was any Man there; that there was one: But I be&s;eech you, continued I, whoever you be that &s;peak to me, tell we who you are. Within a trice after I heard the&s;e words:</P>
<P>We &s;tand in thy Pre&s;ence; thine Eyes behold us; and yet thou &s;ee&s;t us not: Look upon the&s;e Oaks, on which we perceive thine Eyes are fixt: They are we that &s;peak to thee; and if thou be &s;urprized that we &s;peak a Language, u&s;ed in the World from whence thou come&s;t; know, that our fir&s;t Parents were Natives of it: They lived in
<HI>Epirus,</HI> in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dodona;</HI> where their natural goodne&s;s inclined them to render Oracles to the afflicted, who con|&s;ulted them. For that end they learnt the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, which at that time was mo&s;t univer&s;al; that &s;o they might be un|der&s;tood: And becau&s;e we are de&s;cended of them, from Father to Son, the gift of Prophecy hath been tran&s;mitted even to us. Now thou mu&s;t know, That a great Eagle, to whom our Fathers of <HI>Dodona</HI> had given retreat; being di&s;abled from going
<PB N="135" REF="142"> to prey, becau&s;e &s;he had broken one of her Leggs, fed upon the Acorns, which their branches furni&s;hed her with: When one day, being impatient of living in a World where &s;he &s;uffered &s;o much, &s;he took a flight to the Sun; and pro&s;ecuted her Voy|age &s;o happily, that at length &s;he arrived in the luminous Globe, where we are: But upon her arrival, the heat of the Climate put her into a reaching to Vomit, which made her bring up a great quantity of Acorns, not as yet dige&s;ted; the&s;e Acorns &s;prouted, and produced the Oaks which were our Progenitors.</P>
<P>In this manner we changed our Habita|tion: Neverthele&s;s, though you hear us &s;peak a humane Language, you mu&s;t not therefore conclude, That the other Trees expre&s;s them&s;elves &s;o: No Trees, but we Oaks de&s;cended from the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dodona,</HI> &s;peak as you do. For as for the other Ve|getables, they expre&s;s them&s;elves after this manner. Have you not minded that &s;oft and gentle Breeze, that never fails to blow about the Skirts of a Wood? That's the breath of their Words; and that ea&s;ie Mur|muring, or delicate Whi&s;per, whereby they break the &s;acred &s;ilence of their &s;olitude, is, to &s;peak properly, their Language. But though the noi&s;e of Fore&s;ts &s;eem always to be the &s;ame; yet it is &s;o different, that
<PB N="136" REF="143"> every kind of vegetables have di&s;tinctly their own; &s;o that the Birch &s;peaks not like the Maple, nor the Beach like the Cherry Tree: Had the Fooli&s;h People of your World, heard me &s;peak as I do, they would have thought it had been a Devil, enclo&s;ed within my Bark; for they are &s;o far from believing that we can rea&s;on, that they do not imagine we have a Sen&s;itive Soul; though every day they &s;ee, that at the fir&s;t blow the Woodman gives the Tree, the Hatchet enters the Wood four times deeper, than at the &s;econd; and they ought to conjecture, that the fir&s;t blow &s;urpri&s;ed it, and took it unprovided; &s;ince that as &s;oon as it is warned by the pain, it contracts within it &s;elf, unites it Forces for re&s;i&s;ting, and in a manner petrified, that it may with&s;tand the &s;harpne&s;s of its Enemies Arms. But it is not my de&s;ign, to make blind Men Judges of Colours; an Individual is to me the whole kind, and the whole kind, is no more to me than an Individual, when the Individual is not in|fected with the Errors of the kind; and therefore be attentive, for in &s;peaking to you, it's the &s;ame thing to me, as if I &s;poke to all Mankind.</P>
<P>You are to under&s;tand then, in the fir&s;t place, That almo&s;t all the warbling Con|&s;orts of the Mu&s;ick of Birds, are compo&s;ed
<PB N="137" REF="143"> in prai&s;e of Trees; but in recompence al&s;o of the pains they take, in celebrating our famous Actions, it is we that take care to hide their Amours; for don't you imagine when it co&s;ts you &s;o much trouble to find one of their Ne&s;ts, that that's occa&s;ioned by the Sagacity wherewith they hide it? No, it is the Tree it &s;elf, that hath twi&s;ted its Boughs about the ne&s;t, to &s;ecure the Fa|mily of his Lodger, from the Cruelties of Man: And on the contrary, con&s;ider the Airies of tho&s;e, which are hatched either for the de&s;truction of Birds, their fellow Ci|tizens, &s;uch as Sparrow-Hawks, Hobbies, Kites, Faulcons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or which only &s;peak to breed Quarrels, as Jays and Magpies; or that delight to frighten us, as Owls and Howlets: You &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the Ne&s;ts of &s;uch are expo&s;ed to the &s;ight of all People; becau&s;e the Tree removes its Bran|ches from them, that it may leave them for a Prey.</P>
<P>But there is no need of &s;pecifying &s;o ma|ny things, to prove that Trees exert your Functions, as well in Mind as in Body. Is there any one among&s;t you, who hath not ob&s;erved, that in the Spring, when the Sun hath refre&s;hed our Bark with a fertile Sap, we thru&s;t out our Branches, and ex|tend them loaded with Fruit, upon the Brea&s;ts of the Earth, that we are in Love

She is, however, Nine Months in breeding and forming that
<HI>Embrio,</HI> be|fore &s;he bring it forth; but the Tree her Husband, fearing that the Winters cold may be prejudicial to her Conception, &s;trips him&s;elf of his green Garment to cover her, and contents him&s;elf with an old
<HI>Fuil-de|mort</HI> Cloak, to hide part of his Nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Well then, O Men, you look eternally on the&s;e things, and never &s;ee them: Nay, more convincing Proofs have pre&s;ented them&s;elves to your Eyes; but none are &s;o Blind, as tho&s;e that will not See.</P>
<P>I li&s;tened mo&s;t attentively to the di&s;|cour&s;e, with which that Arboreal Voice entertained me, and was expecting the &s;e|quel; when all of a &s;udden it broke off with a Tone like to the Whizzing of the &s;hortne&s;s of Breath, that hinders one to &s;peak.</P>
<P>When I perceived it ob&s;tinately re&s;olved to be &s;ilent, I adjured it by all, which I thought might mo&s;t affect it, that it would vouch&s;afe to in&s;truct one, who had run the Risk of &s;o long and dangerous a Voy|age, upon the account only of learning.
<PB N="139" REF="144"> At the &s;ame time I heard Two or Three Voices, which for my &s;ake made the &s;ame reque&s;t to it, and one I di&s;tingui&s;hed that &s;aid to it, as if in anger,</P>

<P>I turned my Eyes towards the&s;e Plants of Love, and ob&s;erved that the leaves of both gently &s;tirred, as it were, by a voluntary Motion, excited by their Agitation &s;o deli|cate a murmur, that hardly it grazed upon the Ear; and yet one would have &s;aid, that thereby they mutually asked, and an&s;wered one another.</P>

When he perceived him amid&s;t an hundred Arms of Iron, lifted up over his Head: Alas! what became of him? In de&s;pair he threw him&s;elf through a Fore&s;t of Pikes: He cried, roared and foamed: But how ill do I ex|pre&s;s the fearful Commotions of that In|con&s;olable Man; he tore his hair, bit his Hands, rent his Wounds; nay, and when I have &s;aid all I can &s;ay, I am obliged to confe&s;s, that the means of expre&s;&s;ing his grief, died with him&s;elf. When he thought to cut out a way with his Sword to get to
<PB N="141" REF="145"> the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Pylades,</HI> a Mountain of Men with&s;tood his pa&s;&s;age. Neverthele&s;s he broke through them; and having long marched upon the Bloody Trophies of his Victory, by little and little he ap|proached to <HI>Pylades;</HI> but <HI>Pylades</HI> &s;eemed to him already &s;o near Death, that he dur&s;t hardly re&s;i&s;t his Enemies any longer, for fear he might &s;urvive the thing for which alone he lived. To &s;ee his Eyes already full of the &s;hades of Death, one would have &s;aid, That he endeavoured by his Looks to poy|&s;on the Murderers of his Friend. At length
<HI>Pylades</HI> fell down dead; and amorous <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> perceiving his own life, to be upon the brink of his Lips, &s;till retained it; till with a wandring look, having &s;ought and found out <HI>Pylades</HI> among&s;t the Dead, he &s;eemed, by joining Mouth to Mouth, as if he intended to infu&s;e his Soul into the Body of his Friend.</P>
<P>The Younger of tho&s;e two Heroes ex|pired upon the dead Body of his Friend; and you mu&s;t know, that from the Cor|ruption of their Trunk, which without doubt, impregnated the Earth, two young Shrubs were &s;een to &s;prout out from a|mong&s;t their dry bones; who&s;e Stem and Branches mingling promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, &s;eemed to ha&s;ten to grow only, that they might be twi&s;ted into a clo&s;er Contexture.
<PB N="142" REF="146"> It was vi&s;ible that they had changed their Being, without forgetting what they had been; for their perfumed Buds leaned one upon another, and interchanged the Warmth of their Breathing, as it were to make them|&s;elves blow the &s;ooner: But what &s;hall I &s;ay of the loving Di&s;tribution, that main|tained their Society? The Juyce, wherein the nouri&s;hment re&s;ides, never offered it &s;elf to their Stock, but they ceremoniou&s;ly divi|ded it: The one was never ill fed, but the other decayed for want; they both Suckt inwardly the Brea&s;ts of their Nur&s;e; as ye Men do outwardly the Teats of yours. At length the&s;e happy Lovers brought forth Apples, but &s;uch miraculous Apples, as wrought greater Wonders than their Sires had done. All that eat of the Apples of the one, were in&s;tantly &s;mitten with a Pa&s;&s;io|nate Love for every one, that had ta&s;ted the Fruit of the other; and this happened almo&s;t daily, becau&s;e all the Boughs of <HI>Pylades</HI> environed, or were environed by <HI>Ore&s;tes;</HI> and their Fruit, that were almo&s;t Twins, could not endure to be di&s;tant one from the other.</P>
<P>Nature however &s;o cautiou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed their double Efficacy, that when one Man did eat the Fruit of one of the&s;e Trees, and another Man the Fruit of the other, it produced Reciprocal Friend&s;hip; and
<PB N="143" REF="146"> when the &s;ame happened to two Per&s;ons of different Sexes, it begot Love; but &s;uch a vigorous Love, as &s;till retained the Cha|racter of its Cau&s;e; for though that Fruit proportioned its effect to the Capacity, &s;oft|ening its force in a Woman, yet it &s;till re|&s;erved &s;omewhat that was ma&s;culine.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be remarked, That he of the two who had eaten mo&s;t, was al&s;o mo&s;t beloved. The Fruit was not only ve|ry lovely, but very &s;weet al&s;o; there being nothing &s;o lovely and plea&s;ant as Friend&s;hip. And indeed, it was the two qualities of Lovely and Good, which &s;eldom meet in one &s;ubject, that put it into Vogue. How often by its miraculous virtue, hath it mul|tiply'd the Examples of <HI>Pylades</HI> and
<HI>Ore|&s;tes:</HI> Since that time there have been in|&s;tances of &s;uch as
<HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>The&s;eus, A|chilles</HI> and <HI>Patroclus, Ni&s;us</HI> and <HI>Euryalus;</HI> in &s;hort, of an infinite number of tho&s;e, who by more than humane friend&s;hips, have con&s;ecrated their Memory in the Temple of Eternity. Cyens of the&s;e Trees were carried to
<HI>Peloponne&s;us;</HI> and the place of Exerci&s;e, where the
<HI>Thebans</HI> trained their Youth, was adorned with them: They were planted there in a &s;treight line; and in the &s;ea&s;on, when the Fruit hung up|on the branches, the youth who daily went into the place, being tempted by the beau|ty
<PB N="144" REF="147"> thereof, refrained not from eating; which according to cu&s;tom pre&s;ently in|fluenced their Courage. They forthwith interchanged their Souls; every one be|coming the half of another, living le&s;s in him&s;elf than in his Friend; and the faint|heartede&s;t became bold and ra&s;h, for the &s;ake of him he loved.</P>
<P>That cele&s;tial Pa&s;&s;ion warmed their Blood with &s;o noble an Heat, that by the advice of the wi&s;er, the&s;e Lovers were li&s;ted for the Wars into one Company: They have been called &s;ince, becau&s;e of the Heroick Actions which they atchieved, <HI>The &s;acred Band.</HI> The&s;e Exploits went a great deal further, than the <HI>Thebans</HI> had promi&s;ed them&s;elves; for in time of Fight, every one of the&s;e Bravos, ventured &s;uch incredible Efforts, for the &s;afety of his Lo|ver, or for meriting his Affection, that the like hath not been &s;een in Antiquity: And indeed, &s;o long as that amorous Company &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who before were reckoned the wor&s;t Souldiers of all the <HI>Gre|cians,</HI> fought and &s;till overcame afterwards the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> them&s;elves, the mo&s;t War-like people upon the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>But among&s;t a va&s;t number of laudable Actions cau&s;ed by the&s;e Apples; they al&s;o produced (though innocently) &s;ome very ignominious ones.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
<HI>Myrrha,</HI> a young Lady of Quality, eat of them with
<HI>Cinyras</HI> her Father; unfor|tunately the one was of <HI>Pylades,</HI> and the other of <HI>Ore&s;tes.</HI> Love immediately there|upon &s;wallowed up, and &s;o confounded Nature, that <HI>Cinyras</HI> could &s;wear, I am my own Son-in-Law; and <HI>Myrrha,</HI> I am my own Step-Mother. In &s;hort, I think it &s;ufficient to inform you of the nature of that Crime, that at Nine Months end the Father became the Grandfather of tho&s;e he begot; and the Daughter was brought to bed of her Brothers.</P>
<P>Nor was Chance yet &s;atisfied with this Crime; it &s;o ordered matters, that a Bull coming into the Gardens of King <HI>Minos,</HI> vnluckily found under a Tree of <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> &s;ome Apples, which he &s;wallowed down; I &s;ay unluckily, becau&s;e the Queen <HI>Pa&s;iphae</HI> daily eat of that Fruit: And &s;o you have them mad in Love one with another. I &s;hall not, however, &s;peak of the enormous Enjoyment; it &s;hall &s;uffice to &s;ay, That <HI>Pa&s;iphae</HI> plunged her &s;elf into a Crime, that was never matched before.</P>
<P>Exactly about that time, the famous Carver
<HI>Pigmalion,</HI> was cutting a Marble Statue of <HI>Venus</HI> in the palace. The Queen, who loved good Workmen, made him a Pre&s;ent of a couple of the&s;e Apples: He eat the faire&s;t; and becau&s;e accidentally he
<PB N="146" REF="148"> wanted Water, which, as you know, is nece&s;&s;ary for the cutting of Marble; he moi&s;tened his Statue with the Juyce of the other. The Marble, influenced by this Juyce, by little and little grew &s;oft; and the efficacious virtue of that Apple, act|ing according to the de&s;ign of the Work|man, delineated within the Image, the draughts that it had met with in the Super|fice; for it dilated, heated, and coloured, proportionably to the nature of the Places that it found in its pa&s;&s;ages. In fine, the Marble becoming animate, and being touched with the Pa&s;&s;ion of the Apple, embraced
<HI>Pigmalion,</HI> with all her heart; and <HI>Pigmalion,</HI> tran&s;ported with a recipro|cal Love, took her for Wife.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Province the young <HI>Iphis</HI> had eaten of that Fruit, with the fair <HI>Ian|the,</HI> her Companion in all the Exerci&s;es that are requi&s;ite to cau&s;e a reciprocal Friend&s;hip: Their Banquet was attended by its u&s;ual effect: But becau&s;e <HI>Iphis</HI> had found it to be very agreeable to her Palate, &s;he fed &s;o heartily, that her Friend&s;hip encrea|&s;ing with the number of Apples, where|with &s;he could not be &s;atisfied, u&s;urped all the functions of Love; and that Love growing &s;till and &s;till &s;tronger, became more ma&s;culine and vigorous: For &s;eeing her whole Body impregnated with that
<PB N="147" REF="148"> Fruit, &s;trove to form Motions that might an&s;wer the Caprices of her Will; it &s;tirred up &s;o powerfully its own matter, that it made to it &s;elf much &s;tronger Organs, fit to comply with her De&s;ire, and to &s;atisfie her Love in its mo&s;t manly Extent: My meaning is, That
<HI>Iphis</HI> became what one ought to be, that marries a Wife.</P>
<P>I &s;hould term this &s;trange accident a Miracle, had I &s;till a name to give to the following Prodigy.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Youth, called
<HI>Nar|ci&s;&s;us,</HI> had by his Love merited the Affecti|on of a very lovely Maid, whom the Poets have celebrated by the Name of <HI>Echo.</HI> But &s;eeing Women, as you know, are fon|der of being much made of, than tho&s;e of our Sex; &s;he having heard the virtue of the Apples of <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> much talked of, u&s;ed means to procure a great many of them, from &s;everal parts; and becau&s;e &s;he appre|hended, (Love being always fearful) That tho&s;e of the one Tree, might have le&s;s force than the other, &s;he would have him to ta&s;te of both: But &s;o &s;oon as he had eat|en them, the image of
<HI>Echo</HI> was quite blotted out of his memory; all his Love turned towards him who had dige&s;ted the Fruit; and he became both the Lover and the Beloved; for the &s;ub&s;tance drawn from the Apple of <HI>Pylades,</HI> embraced within
<PB N="148" REF="149"> him the &s;ub&s;tance of the Apple of <HI>O|re&s;tes.</HI> That twin-fruit diffu&s;ed through the whole ma&s;s of his blood, excited all the parts of his body to care&s;s one a|nother: His Heart, where their double virtue boiled, darted its flames inwards; all his Members animated with his Pa&s;&s;ion, endeavouring to penetrate one into ano|ther: Nay, not &s;o much as his Image &s;till burning in the cold Fountains, but at|tracted his Body to join it: In a word, poor <HI>Narci&s;&s;us</HI> fell de&s;perately in Love with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I will not be tedious in relating to you his deplorable Cata&s;trophy; the Ages of Antiquity have &s;poken enough of that: And be&s;ides I have Two Adventures &s;till to acquaint you with, which will take up the time far better.</P>
<P>You &s;hall know then, that the fair <HI>Sal|macis</HI> frequented the company of the Shep|herd <HI>Hermaphroditus,</HI> but with no other Privacies, than what the Neighbourhood of their Hou&s;es could allow of: When For|tune, who delights to di&s;turb the mo&s;t quiet and harmle&s;s Lives, &s;o ordered, that in an A&s;&s;embly of Plays, where the rewards for Beauty and Running were two of the&s;e Apples, <HI>Hermaphroditus</HI> gained that of the Race, and <HI>Salmacis</HI> the other of Beauty. Though they had been gathered together,
<PB N="149" REF="149"> yet it was from different Branches; be|cau&s;e the&s;e amorous Fruits mingled toge|ther &s;o cunningly, that one of <HI>Pylades</HI> was never without another of <HI>Ore&s;tes;</HI> and that was the rea&s;on, why appearing to be Twins, they plucked always a Couple at a time. The fair
<HI>Salmacis</HI> eat her Apple, and pretty <HI>Hermaphroditus</HI> lockt his up in a Cupboard. <HI>Salmacis</HI> being in&s;pired with the effects of her own Apple, and of that of the Shepherd, which began to grow hot in his Cupboard, felt her &s;elf attracted to|wards him, by the Sympathetick Flux and Reflux of the two.</P>
<P>The Shepherds Parents, who perceived the Amours of the Nymph, finding their advantage in that Alliance, endeavoured to entertain and promote it: And therefore having heard much talking of the Twin-Apples, as of a Fruit who&s;e Juyce inclined People to Love, they di&s;tilled &s;ome of them; and having rectified the Spirit to the high|e&s;t degree, found a means to make their Son and his Lover drink of it. The virtue of the Juyce, being &s;ublimed to the highe&s;t degree it could be rai&s;ed to, kindled in the Hearts of the Lovers, &s;o vehement a de&s;ire of Conjunction, that at fir&s;t &s;ight
<HI>Herma|phroditus</HI> was &s;wallowed up in <HI>Salmacis,</HI> and
<HI>Salmacis</HI> melted away in the Arms of <HI>Hermaphroditus:</HI> The one pa&s;t into the
<PB N="150" REF="150"> other, and of two of different Sexes, they made up I know not what double Per&s;on, that was neither Man nor Woman. When
<HI>Hermaphroditus</HI> had a mind to en|joy <HI>Salmacis,</HI> he found him&s;elf to be the Nymph; and when <HI>Salmacis</HI> de&s;ired to be embraced by <HI>Hermaphroditus,</HI> &s;he percei|ved her &s;elf to be the Shepherd. This couple though &s;till retained its Unity; it Begat and Conceived, and yet was neither Man nor Woman: In &s;hort, in it Nature hath &s;hewn a Miracle, which &s;he hath never been able &s;ince to hinder from being One.</P>
<P>Well now, are not the&s;e pretty &s;urpri&s;|ing Stories? Really they are; for to &s;ee a Daughter couple with her Father; a young Prince&s;s glut her &s;elf with the Amours of a Bull; a Man a&s;pire to the Emjoyment of a Stone. Another to e&s;pou&s;e him&s;elf; a Maid to Celebrate a Marriage, which &s;he con&s;ummated as a youth; to cea&s;e to be a Man, without beginning to be a Woman; to become a Twin out of the Mothers Womb, and the Twin of another who had no Relation to him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are things quite out of the com|mon Road of Nature; and neverthele&s;s, you'll be more &s;urpri&s;ed at what I am about to tell you.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;umptuous Variety of all &s;orts of Fruits and Trees, which were brought
<PB N="151" REF="150"> from di&s;tant Climates, for the Marriage-Fea&s;t of
<HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> there was pre&s;ented to him a Cien of <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> which he cau&s;ed to be grafted upon a Plane Tree; and among&s;t the Dainties of the la&s;t cour&s;e, &s;ome Apples of the &s;ame Tree were &s;erved up to him.</P>
<P>The delicacy of the Di&s;h invited him to eat heartily of it; and the &s;ub&s;tance of that Fruit, being after the three Concoctions converted into a perfect Seed; it formed in the Womb of the Queen, the Embryo of his Son <HI>Artaxerxes;</HI> for all the particu|lars of his Life, have made Phy&s;icians con|jecture, that he mu&s;t needs have been pro|duced after this manner.</P>
<P>When the young Heart of that Prince, was old enough to de&s;erve the anger of Love, it was not ob&s;erved, that he &s;ighed at all after any of his own kind: he loved no|thing but Trees, Groves and Woods; but above all tho&s;e that affected him, the lovely Plane Tree, whereon his Father
<HI>Camby&s;es</HI> had formerly cau&s;ed that &s;hoot of <HI>Orestes</HI> to be graffed, wun his greate&s;t affection.</P>
<P>His Con&s;titution &s;uited &s;o nicely with the progre&s;s of the Plane Tree, that he &s;eemed to grow with the Branches of it: He daily went and embraced it; in his Sleep he dreamt of nothing el&s;e; and under the Ca|nopy of its Green Hangings, he di&s;patched all his Affairs. It was ea&s;ily perceived,
<PB N="152" REF="151"> that the Plane Tree &s;mitten with a recipro|cal Flame, was ravi&s;hed with his Care&s;&s;es: For on all occa&s;ions, without any appa|rent rea&s;on, its Leaves were &s;een to &s;hake, and in a manner leap for Joy; the Branches bend round about his Head, as it were to make a Crown for him, and to reach down &s;o near to his Face, that it was ea&s;ie to be known, that it was rather to ki&s;s him, than out of any natural inclination, of bending downwards. Nay, it was al&s;o ob&s;erved, that out of Jealou&s;ie it ranked its Leaves in order, joining one clo&s;e to the other, for fear lea&s;t the Sun-Beams pierc|ing through, might ki&s;s him as well as it. The King on his part, &s;et no more bounds to his Love; he had his Bed made under the Plane Tree, and the Tree not not knowing how to repay his Friend&s;hip, be&s;towed upon him the mo&s;t precious thing that Trees have, which was its Honey|dew, that every Morning dropt upon his Face.</P>
<P>Their Care&s;&s;es would have la&s;ted longer, had not Death, the Enemy of Noble Acti|ons, put an end to them: <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> died of Love in the embraces of his dear Plane Tree; and the Per&s;ians extreamly afflicted at the death of &s;o good a Prince, re&s;olved that they might give him &s;atisfaction even after his Death, that his Body &s;hould be
<PB N="153" REF="151"> burnt with the Branches of that Tree, and no other Wood employed in Con&s;uming it.</P>
<P>When the Funeral Pile was kindled, the Flame was &s;een to twi&s;t it &s;elf with that of the Fat of the Body; and their burning Locks which curled one into the other, to taper into a Pyramide as far as could be di&s;|cerned.</P>
<P>That pure and &s;ubtile Fire divided not; but when it arrived at the Sun, whither you know all igneous matter tends, it formed the &s;prout of the Apple-Tree of <HI>Ore|&s;tes,</HI> which you &s;ee there on your Right Hand.</P>
<P>Now the Breed of that Fruit is lo&s;t in your World, and I'll tell you how that mi&s;chance happened.</P>
<P>Fathers and Mothers, who as you know, are only guided by intere&s;t, in the manage|ment of their Dome&s;tick Affairs, being vext that their Children, &s;o &s;oon as they had eaten of the&s;e Apples, &s;quandered away up|on their Friends all that they had, burnt all the young Plants they could find of that Tree; &s;o that the kind being lo&s;t, is the rea&s;on why no true Friend is now to be found.</P>
<P>As fa&s;t then as the&s;e Trees were con&s;um|ed by the Fire, the Rain that fell, calcined their A&s;hes, &s;o that the congealed Juyce
<PB N="154" REF="152"> was petrified in the &s;ame manner, as the &s;ap of burnt Fern is changed into Gla&s;s. Hence it is, that in all Climates of the Earth two Metallick Stones are formed of the a&s;hes of tho&s;e Twin-Trees, that now adays are called the Iron and Load-&s;tone, which becau&s;e of the Sympathy of the Fruits of <HI>Pylades</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> the virtue where|of they have &s;till retained, always a&s;pire to embrace one another; and ob&s;erve that if the piece of the Load-&s;tone be the bigger, it attracts the Iron; or if the piece of Iron exceed in quantity, it attracts the Load-&s;tone; as formerly it happened in the miraculous Effects of the Apples of
<HI>Pylades</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> of the one of which who&s;o|ever had eaten mo&s;t, was the mo&s;t beloved of him who had eaten the other.</P>
<P>Now Iron feeds &s;o vi&s;ibly upon the Load|&s;tone, and the Load-&s;tone upon the Iron, that the one ru&s;ts, and the other lo&s;es its force; unle&s;s they be put together for the reparation of what &s;ub&s;tance they lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Have you never ob&s;erved a piece of Load|&s;tone, laid upon the File-du&s;t of Iron, you'll &s;ee the Load-&s;tone cover it &s;elf in a trice with the&s;e metallick Atoms; and the amo|rous Heat wherewith they cling together, is &s;o &s;udden and impatient, that when they have embraced one another in all places, you would &s;ay that there is not one grain
<PB N="155" REF="152"> of the Load-&s;tone, that would not ki&s;s a grain of the Iron, nor a grain of the Iron, that would not be united to a grain of the Load-&s;tone; for the Iron or Load-&s;tone be|ing &s;eparated, continually &s;end out from their Ma&s;s, &s;ome mo&s;t agile little Bodies, in que&s;t of that which they love: But when they have found that, having got their de&s;ire, every one puts an end to their Progre&s;s; and the Load-&s;tone takes its re&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Iron, as the Iron wholly contents its &s;elf in the enjoyment of the Load-&s;tone. From the Sap then of the&s;e two Trees, the humour which hath gi|ven Being to tho&s;e two Metals has been derived.</P>
<P>Before that they were unknown; and if you have a mind to know, of what matter Arms were made for the War; <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> armed him&s;elf again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> with the Jaw-bone of an A&s;s;
<HI>Jupiter</HI> King of <HI>Crete,</HI> with Artificial Fire-works, where|by he imitated the Thunder, in &s;ubduing of his Enemies; and, in a word,
<HI>Hercules</HI> with a Club overcame Tyrants, and cru&s;h|ed Mon&s;ters. But the&s;e two Metals, have another more &s;pecifick relation to our two Trees: You mu&s;t know, that though that Couple of Life-le&s;s Lovers incline towards the Pole, yet they never tend thither but in Company; and I'll tell you the Rea&s;on of
<PB N="156" REF="153"> it, after I have di&s;cour&s;ed to you a little a|bout the Poles.</P>
<P>The Poles are the Mouths of Heaven, by which it &s;ucks up again the Light, Heat, and Influences that it hath &s;hed upon the Earth: Otherwi&s;e if all the Trea&s;ures of the Sun, remounted not to their &s;ource, (all its Brightne&s;s being only a du&s;t of inflamed Atoms, which are detached from its Globe;) it would have been long ago ex|tingui&s;hed, and &s;hone no more: Or that abundance of little igneous Bodies, heap|ing together upon the Earth, when they could not get out again, would have alrea|dy con&s;umed it. There mu&s;t then, as I have told you, be breathing Holes in Hea|ven, by which the Repletions of the Earth are di&s;charged, and others by which Hea|ven may repair its lo&s;&s;es; to the end the eternal Circulation of the&s;e little bodies of Life, may &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pa&s;s through all the Globes of this va&s;t Univer&s;e. Now the breathing holes of Heaven are the Poles, through which it retakes the Souls of all that die in the other Worlds without it; and all the Stars are its Mouths, and the Pores through which again it exhales its Spirits. But to &s;hew you, that this is not &s;o new an Imagination; when your Ancient Poets, to whom Phylo&s;ophy di&s;covered the mo&s;t hidden &s;ecrets of Nature, &s;pake of an Hero,
<PB N="159" REF="153"> who&s;e Soul they would have &s;aid was gone to live with the Gods; they expre&s;&s;ed it in this manner: He is gone up to the Pole, he is &s;eated on the Pole, he hath pa&s;t through the Pole; becau&s;e they knew that the Poles where the only Avenues, through which Heaven receives again, all that is gone out from thence. If the Authority of the&s;e great Men be not &s;ufficient to convince you, the Experience of your modern Na|vigators, who have &s;ailed towards the North, may, perhaps, give you &s;atisfaction. They have found, that the nearer they drew towards the Bear, during the Six Months of Night, when it was thought that Climate lay under a black Darkne&s;s, a great Light cleared the Horizon, which could not proceed but from the Pole; becau&s;e the more one drew near to it, and by con&s;e|quence removed from the Sun, that Light became greater. It is very probable then, that it proceeds from the Beams of day, and a great heap of Souls, which as you know, are only made of Luminous A|toms, that are returning to Heaven by their wonted Doors.</P>
<P>This being &s;o, it is no difficult matter to comprehend, wherefore the Iron rubbed with the Load-&s;tone, or the Load-&s;tone rub|bed with the Iron, turns towards the Pole; for they being an Extract of the Body of

<P>This voice, as I think, was about to go on with another Di&s;cour&s;e; but the noi&s;e of a great Alarm that happened hindred it: All the Fore&s;t in an uproar, re&s;ounded with nothing but the&s;e Words, <HI>The Plague, the Plague, stand upon your Guard, look about ye.</HI></P>
<P>I adjured the Tree, that had &s;o long en|tertained me in di&s;cour&s;e, to tell me the Cau&s;e of &s;o great a Di&s;order. Friend, &s;aid he to me, we are not in the&s;e quarters, &s;uffici|ently as yet informed of all the Particulars of the Evil: I'll only tell you in Three Words, that the Plague wherewith we are threatned, is that which Men call a Fire;
<PB N="159" REF="154"> we may very well call it &s;o, becau&s;e a|mong&s;t us there is no &s;uch contagious Di|&s;temper. The remedy we are about to u&s;e again&s;t it, is to force our breath, and blow altogether, towards the place from whence the Inflamation comes, to the end we may drive back that bad Air. I believe that burning Feaver is occa&s;ioned us by a fiery Bea&s;t, that for &s;ome days has been roaming about our Woods; for &s;eeing they never go without Fire, and cannot be without it, this, without doubt, is come to &s;et &s;ome of our Trees on Fire.</P>
<P>We &s;ent for the Animal <HI>Frozen-no&s;e,</HI> to come to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance; however is not as yet arrived. But, farewel, I have no time to talk, we mu&s;t look to the publick Safety; nay, do you look to your &s;elf al&s;o, and fly for it, el&s;e you'll be in danger of being in|volved in our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I followed the coun&s;el, but without much &s;training, becau&s;e I knew my Legs. In the mean time I was &s;o ill acquainted with the Geopraphy of the Country, that at the end of Eighteen hours, I found my &s;elf at the back of the Fore&s;t that I thought I fled from; and to add to my fear, a hun|dred dreadful Thunder-claps &s;tunned my Brains, whil&s;t the gha&s;tly and pale Glimp&s;es of a Thou&s;and fla&s;hes of Lightning put out my Eye-&s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="155"> The&s;e Claps redoubled from time to time with &s;o much fury, that one would have &s;aid, The Foundations of the World were about to be over-turned; and never|thele&s;s the Heavens never appeared more &s;erene. Though I was at my wits end, yet the de&s;ire of knowing the Cau&s;e of &s;uch an extraordinary Accident, made me go towards the place, from whence the noi&s;e &s;eemed to proceed.</P>
<P>I had advanced about four hundred Fur|longs, when I perceived in the middle of a great Plain, as it were, two Bowls, which having ru&s;tled and turned along time round one another, approached and then recoy|led: And I ob&s;erved that when they knocked one again&s;t the other, then were the&s;e great Claps heard; but going a little farther on, I found that what at a di&s;tance I had taken for two Bowls, were two Ani|mals; one of which, tho round below, formed a Triangle about the middle, and his lofty Head with ruddy Locks, which floated upwards, &s;pired into a Pyramide; his Bo|dy was bored like a Sieve, and through the&s;e little holes, that &s;erved him for Pores, thin flames glided, which &s;eemed to cover him with a Plume of Fires.</P>
<P>Walking about there, I met with a very venerable old Man, who ob&s;erved that fa|mous conflict, with no le&s;s curio&s;ity than
<PB N="161" REF="155"> my &s;elf. He made me a &s;ign to draw nigh, I obeyed, and we &s;at down by one another.</P>
<P>I had a de&s;ign to have asked him the mo|tive, that had brought him into that Coun|try, but he &s;topt my Mouth with the&s;e words; Well then, you &s;hall know the motive, that brought me into this Country. And thereupon he gave me a full account of all the particulars of his Voyage. I leave it to you to judge, in what amazement I was. In the mean while, to increa&s;e my con&s;ternation, as I was boyling with de&s;ire to ask him, what Spirit revealed my thoughts to him: No, no, cryed he, it's no Spirit that reveals your thoughts to me&mdash;</P>
<P>This new hit of Divination, made me ob&s;erve him with greater attention than be|fore, and I perceived that he acted my Carriage, my Ge&s;tures and Looks, that he po&s;tured all his Members, and &s;haped all the parts of his Countenance, according to the pattern of mine; in a word, my Sha|dow in relief could not have repre&s;ented me better. I &s;ee, &s;aid he, you are in pain to know why I counterfeit you, and I am willing to tell you. Know then, that to the end I might know your in&s;ide, I di&s;pofed all the parts of my Body, into the &s;ame Order I &s;aw yours in; for being in all parts &s;ci|tuated like you, by that di&s;po&s;ition of mat|ter, I excite in my &s;elf the &s;ame thought, that
<PB N="162" REF="156"> the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of matter rai&s;es in you.</P>
<P>You will judge this to be a thing po&s;&s;ible, if heretofore you have ob&s;erved, that Twins who are like, have commonly the like Mind, Pa&s;&s;ions and Will: in&s;omuch, that there were two Twins at
<HI>Paris,</HI> who always had the &s;ame Sickne&s;&s;es, and the &s;ame Health; married without knowing one anothers de&s;ign, the &s;ame day and at the &s;ame hour; wrote Letters mutually to one another in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, Words and Stile; and in &s;hort, have upon the &s;ame Subject compo|&s;ed a Copy of the &s;ame kind of Ver&s;e, with the &s;ame Stops, Words and Order. Now don't you &s;ee, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, but that the Compo&s;ition of the Organs of their Bodies, being in all Circum&s;tances alike, they mu&s;t act in a like manner; &s;eeing two like In&s;truments alike touched, ought to render a like Harmony? And that &s;o I ha|ving conformed my Body wholly to yours, and become, if I may &s;ay &s;o, your Twin; it is impo&s;&s;ible, but that the &s;ame Agitation of Matter, mu&s;t cau&s;e in both of us the &s;ame Agitation of Mind.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o, he fell a counterfeiting me again, and thus went on:</P>
<P>You are at pre&s;ent in great pain to know, the Original of the Conflict of the&s;e two Mon&s;ters; but I will inform you of it. Know then, that the Trees of the Fore&s;t be|hind
<PB N="163" REF="156"> us, being unable with their blowing, to repel the attempts of the fiery Bea&s;t, have had their recour&s;e to the Animal
<HI>Frozen-No&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I never heard of the&s;e Animals, &s;aid I to him, but from an Oak of this Country, and that in great ha&s;te too, becau&s;e it was &s;ollicitous for its own &s;afety; and there|fore I would beg of you, to give me &s;ome account of them.</P>
<P>He thereupon &s;pake to me in this man|ner: In this Globe where we are, we &s;hould &s;ee the Woods very thin &s;ow'n, by rea&s;on of the great number of the fiery Bea&s;ts that de&s;troy them; were it not for the Animals <HI>Frozen-No&s;es,</HI> which at the de&s;ire of the Fore&s;ts their Friends, come daily to cure the Sick Trees: I &s;ay cure, for no &s;ooner have they, from their Icy Mouth, blown upon the coals of that Plague, but they put it out.</P>
<P>In the World of the Earth, from whence both you and I are come, the fiery Bea&s;t is called the <HI>Salamander;</HI> and the Animal
<HI>Frozen-No&s;e,</HI> is known by the name of <HI>Re|mora.</HI> Now you mu&s;t know, that the <HI>Remoras</HI> live towards the extremity of the Pole, at the bottom of the <HI>Mare Glaciale;</HI> and it is the cold of the&s;e Fi&s;hes, evaporated through their Scales, which makes the Sea-Water in tho&s;e quarters to freeze, though it be Salt.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="157"> Mo&s;t Navigators, who have Sailed for the di&s;covery of
<HI>Green-land,</HI> have at length experienced, that in certain Sea&s;ons they found none of the Ice, which at other times had &s;topt them: Now though that Sea was open at the time, when it is bittere&s;t Winter there, yet they have attributed the cau&s;e of it, to &s;ome &s;ecret Heat that had thawed it; but it is far more probable, that the <HI>Remo|ras,</HI> who only feed upon Ice, had at that time devoured the whole &s;tock. Be&s;ides you are to know, that &s;ome Months after they have filled their Bellies, that &s;trange Food of unea&s;y dige&s;tion, &s;o chills their Stomack, that their very blowing of their Breath, freezes again all the Sea under the Pole. When they come on Land (for they live in both Elements) they fill their Paunch on|ly with Hemlock, Wolf-bane, Opium and Mandrakes.</P>
<P>It's wondred at in our World, whence proceed tho&s;e piercing North-Winds, that always bring Fro&s;t with them; but if our Country-men knew what we know, that the <HI>Remoras</HI> live in that Climate, they would know as well as we, that they pro|ceed from a puff of their Breath, whereby they endeavour to blow back the heat of the Sun that draws near them.</P>
<P>That Stygian-Water wherewith the Great <HI>Alexander</HI> was poy&s;oned, and who&s;e
<PB N="165" REF="157"> Coldne&s;s petrified his Bowels, was the Pi&s;s of one of the&s;e Animals. In fine, the <HI>Re|mora</HI> contains all the principles of Cold in &s;o eminenta degree, that pa&s;&s;ing under a Ship the Ve&s;&s;el is &s;eized with Cold, and &s;truck with &s;uch a Numne&s;s, that it cannot wag out of the place. And that's the rea&s;on that one half of tho&s;e, who have crui&s;ed North-ward, for the di&s;covery of the Pole, never came back again; becau&s;e it is a Mir|racle if the <HI>Remoras,</HI> who are &s;o numerous in that Sea, &s;top not their Ve&s;&s;els. And &s;o much for the Animals
<HI>Frozen-No&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But as to the Fiery Bea&s;ts, they lodge on Land under Mountains of burning <HI>Bitumen,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Aetna, Ve&s;uvius</HI> and others. The Pimples which you &s;ee upon the Brea&s;t of this Bea&s;t, that proceed from the Infla|mation of his Liver, are&mdash;</P>
<P>Hear we put a &s;top to our Talk, that we might be more attentive to that famous Duel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Salamander</HI> attacked with much ar|dour; but the <HI>Remora</HI> defended impenetra|bly. Every da&s;h they gave one another, be|got a clap of Thunder; as it happens in the Worlds there abouts, where the Cla&s;hing of a hot Cloud with a cold, cau&s;es the &s;ame Report.</P>
<P>At every glance of Rage which the <HI>Sa|lamander</HI> darted again&s;t its Enemy, out of its Eyes fla&s;hed a reddi&s;h Light, that &s;eemed
<PB N="166" REF="158"> to kindle the Air in flying; it &s;weat boyling Oyl, and pi&s;&s;ed <HI>Aqua-fortis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Remora</HI> on the other hand, that gro&s;s, &s;quare and heavy Animal, pre&s;ented a Body &s;caled all over with Y&s;icles. Its large Eyes lookt like two Chry&s;tal-plates, who&s;e glances conveyed &s;o chilling a light, that on what member of my Body it fixed them, I felt a &s;hivering Winter-cold. If I thought to put my Hand before me, my Fingers ends were nummed; nay, the very Air about infected with its quality, con|den&s;ed into Snow, the Earth hardned un|der his Steps; and I could reckon the Foot|ings of the Bea&s;t, by the number of the Chil-blanes, that welcomed me when I trode upon them.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Fight, the <HI>Sala|mander</HI> by the vigorous activity of its fir&s;t heat, had put the <HI>Remora</HI> into a Sweat; but at length that Sweat cooling again, glazed all the Plain with &s;o &s;lippery an En|namel, that the <HI>Salamander</HI> could not get up to the
<HI>Remora</HI> without falling. The Philo&s;opher and I knew very well, that the trouble of falling and ri&s;ing &s;o many times, had made it weary; for the&s;e Thunder-claps &s;o dreadful before, that proceeded from the &s;hock he gave its Enemy, were no more now but the dull Sound of tho&s;e little After-claps, which denote the end of a
<PB N="167" REF="158"> Storm; and that dull Sound, deadned by de|grees, degenerated into a Whizzing, like to that of a hot Iron plunged into cold Water.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Remora</HI> perceived, that the Fight was near an end, by the Weakne&s;s of the &s;hock which was hardly felt by it, it rai&s;ed it &s;elf upon an Angle of its Cube, and with all its weight fell upon the Brea&s;t of the <HI>Salamander,</HI> with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that the Heart of the <HI>Salamander,</HI> wherein all the re&s;t of its heat was contracted, bur&s;ting, made &s;o fearful a Crack, that I know nothing in nature to compare it to.</P>
<P>Thus died the Fiery Bea&s;t, under the lazy re&s;i&s;tance of the Animal <HI>Frozen-No&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Sometime after the <HI>Remora</HI> was gone, we approached the place of Battel; and the old Man having daubed his Hands over with the Earth, on which it had walked, as a Pre&s;ervative again&s;t burning, laid hold on the Dead Body of the <HI>Salamander.</HI> Give me but the Body of this Animal, &s;aid he, and I've no need for Fire in my Kitchen; for provided it be hung upon the Pot-hook, it will Boyl and Roa&s;t all that's laid upon the Hearth. As for the Eyes, I'll carefully keep them; if they were clean&s;ed from the Shades of Death, you'd take them for two little Suns. The Antients of our World knew well what u&s;e to make of them; they called them burning-Lamps, and never hung them
<PB N="168" REF="159"> up but in the Pompous Monuments of Illu&s;trious Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moderns</HI> have found &s;ome of them, by digging into the&s;e famous Tombs; but their ignorant Curio&s;ity made them put them out, thinking to find behind the bro|ken Membranes, the Fire which they &s;aw &s;hine there.</P>
<P>The old Man went on &s;till, and I fol|lowed him, li&s;tning very attentively to the Wonders he told me. But &s;ince I have been &s;peaking of the Fight, I mu&s;t not for|get the Di&s;cour&s;e which we had, concerning the Animal <HI>Frozen-No&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I don't think, &s;aid he to me, that you have ever &s;een a <HI>Remora;</HI> for they are Fi&s;h that never ri&s;e to the brim of the Water; nay, &s;eldom or never do they leave the Northern Sea: But without doubt you have &s;een a &s;ort of Animals, which in &s;ome manner may be reckoned of their kind. I told you ju&s;t now, that that Sea which reaches towards the Pole, is full of <HI>Remo|ras,</HI> that &s;pawn in the mud as other Fi&s;hes do. You mu&s;t know then, that that Seed, the Extract of all their ma&s;s, &s;o eminently contains all its Coldne&s;s, that if a Ship pa&s;s over it, the Ship contracts one or more Worms, which become Birds; who&s;e Blood is &s;o de&s;titute of heat, that though they have Wings, yet they are reckoned among&s;t
<PB N="169" REF="159"> Fi&s;hes: And &s;o the Pope, who knows their Original, forbids them not to be eaten in Lent; and the&s;e are the Fowls which in
<HI>France</HI> they call <HI>Maquereu&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>I marched on &s;till without any other de|&s;ign than to follow him, but &s;o glad that I had found a Man, that I dur&s;t not take my Eyes off of him; &s;o afraid was I to lo&s;e my Man. Mortal Youth, &s;aid he to me, (for I well perceive, that you have not as yet paid the tribute, which we owe to Nature, as I have done,) &s;o &s;oon as I &s;aw you, I di&s;covered in your Face, &s;omewhat that &s;hews you to be curious and inqui&s;itive. If I be not mi&s;taken in the Shape and Confor|mation of your Body, you mu&s;t be a
<HI>French|man,</HI> and a Native of <HI>Paris.</HI> That City is the place, wherewith I ended my Misfor|tunes, which I had carried about with me all over
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>My name is <HI>Campanella,</HI> and I am a
<HI>Ca|labrian</HI> by Nation. Since my coming into the Sun, I have &s;pent my time in vi&s;iting the Climates of this great Globe, that I may di&s;cover the Wonders of them: It is divi|ded as the Earth is, into Kingdoms, Re|publicks, States and Principalities; &s;o that Four-footed Bea&s;ts, Fowl, Plants and Stones, every one have their own; and though &s;ome of the&s;e allow no entrance a|mong&s;t them, to Animals of a &s;trange kind,
<PB N="170" REF="160"> e&s;pecially to Men, whom the Birds above all others mortally hate, yet I can travel over all without any danger; becau&s;e the Soul of a Philo&s;opher, is made up of more &s;ubtile Parts, than the In&s;truments which might be made u&s;e of to torment it. I was by good luck in the Province of the Trees, when the di&s;orders of the <HI>Salamander</HI> began tho&s;e great Thunder-claps, that you mu&s;t have heard as well as I, which guided me to their Field of Battel, whither you came &s;oon after; but I was upon my return to the Province of Philo&s;ophers&mdash; What, &s;aid I to him, are there Philo&s;ophers al&s;o then in the Sun? Are there, replied the good Man, yes, &s;ure; and they are the chief Inhabi|tants of the Sun, and the very &s;ame, whom Fame in your World doth celebrate with &s;o full Mouth. You may &s;hortly conver&s;e with them, provided you have the Cou|rage to follow me; for before Three Days be over, I hope to be in their City. I don't think you can po&s;&s;ibly perceive the manner, how the&s;e great Spirits are tran&s;ported hi|ther. No certainly, cried I, for could &s;o many others been hitherto &s;o blind, as not to find the way? Or that after our Death, we fall into the Hands of an Examiner of Spirits, who according to our Capacity grants or refu&s;es us our freedom in the Sun?</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="160"> Nothing of that, replied the old Man: It's by a Principle of Similitude, that Souls attain to this ma&s;s of Light; for this World is made up of nothing el&s;e, but the Spirits of every thing that dies in the Circumambient Orbs, &s;uch as <HI>Mercury, Venus,</HI> the Earth, <HI>Mars, Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, &s;o &s;oon as a Plant, a Bea&s;t or a Man expire, their Souls without extincti|on mount to its Sphere, ju&s;t as you &s;ee the flame of a Candle points up thither, in &s;pight of the Tallow that holds it by the Feet. Now all the&s;e Souls being united to the &s;ource of Day, and purged from the gro&s;s matter that pe&s;tered them, exert far more noble Functions than tho&s;e of Growing, Feeling and Rea&s;oning; for they are em|ployed in making the Blood, and vital Spi|rits of the Sun, that great and perfect Ani|mal: And therefore al&s;o, you ought not to doubt, but that the Sun acts by the Spirit, more perfectly far than you do; &s;ince it is by the heat of a Million of the&s;e Souls rec|tified, whereof his own is an Elixir, that he knows the &s;ecret of Life, that he influ|ences the matter of your Worlds, with the power of Generation, and that he makes Bodies &s;en&s;ible that they have a Being; and, in &s;hort, that he renders him&s;elf, and all things el&s;e, vi&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="161"> Now it remains, that I &s;hould clear to you, why the Souls of Philo&s;opers, do not e&s;&s;entially join to the ma&s;s of the Sun, as tho&s;e of other Men.</P>
<P>There are three orders of Spirits in all the Planets, that is to &s;ay, in the little Worlds which move about this.</P>
<P>The gro&s;&s;er &s;erve only to repair the Plumpne&s;s of the Sun, the &s;ubtile in&s;inuate into the place of his Beams; but tho&s;e of Philo&s;ophers, having contracted no Impurity in their exile, arrive entire in the Sphere of Day to become its Inhabitants. Now they are not as others, a con&s;tituent part of its Ma&s;s; becau&s;e the matter that compo&s;es them, in the point of their Generation, is &s;o exactly mixed, that nothing can again di&s;&s;olve it: Like to that which forms Gold, Diamonds, and the Stars, whereof all the parts are &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven and knit to|gether, that the &s;tronge&s;t Di&s;&s;olvent cannot &s;eparate the Mixture.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Souls of Phil&s;ophers, are &s;o much in regard of other Souls, what Gold, Diamonds, and the Stars are, in re&s;pect of other Bodies; that <HI>Epicurus</HI> in the Sun, is the &s;ame
<HI>Epicurus,</HI> who heretofore lived in the Earth.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure which I received in hear|ing that great Man, &s;hortned my way; and I often &s;tarted curious Que&s;tions, about
<PB N="173" REF="161"> which I importuned his opinion, that I might be thereby in&s;tructed: And really I never found &s;o great goodne&s;s in any Man, as in him; for though by rea&s;on of the Agi|lity of his Sub&s;tance, he might in a few Days have arrived in the Kingdom of Phi|lo&s;ophers; yet he cho&s;e rather to take the trouble of Jogging on with me, than to leave me amid&s;t va&s;t Solitudes.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he was in great ha&s;te; for I remember that having asked him, why he returned before he had &s;urveyed all the Re|gions of that great world? He made an&s;wer, that his Impatience to &s;ee one of his Friends, who was newly arrived, obliged him to break off his Travels. I found by the &s;e|quel of his di&s;cour&s;e, that his Friend was that famous Philo&s;opher of our time <HI>Mon&s;i|eur des Cartes,</HI> and that he made all ha&s;te to meet him.</P>
<P>He made an&s;wer al&s;o, when I asked him, what he thought of his natural Philo&s;ophy? that it ought to be read with the &s;ame re|&s;pect, as Men li&s;ten to Oracles. Not, ad|ded he, but that the Science of natural things hath need, as other Sciences have, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s our Judgment with <HI>Axioms,</HI> which it proves not: But the Principles of his are &s;imple and &s;o natural, that being once &s;uppo&s;ed, there is nothing that more nece&s;&s;arily &s;atisfies all Appearances.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="162"> I could not forbear to interrupt him in this place: But methinks, &s;aid I to him, that that Philo&s;opher hath always impugn|ed the
<HI>Vacuum:</HI> And neverthele&s;s, though he was an <HI>Epicurean,</HI> yet that he might have the honour of giving a Beginning to the Principles of
<HI>Epicurus,</HI> that's to &s;ay, to <HI>A|tomes;</HI> he hath &s;uppo&s;ed for the beginning of things, a Chaos of matter throughly &s;o|lid, which God divided into an innumera|ble number of little Squares, to every one of which he gave oppo&s;ite Motions. Now he will have the&s;e Cubes, by rubbing one a|gain&s;t another, to have crumbled them&s;elves into pieces of all &s;orts of Figures: But how can he conceive, that the&s;e &s;quare Peices, could begin to turn &s;eparately, without granting a Vacuity betwixt their Angles? Mu&s;t there not be nece&s;&s;arily a Void in the &s;paces, which the Angles of the&s;e Squares were forced to leave, that they might move? And then could the&s;e Squares, which only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a certain Extent before they turn|ed, move in a Circle, unle&s;s in their Cir|cumference they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as much more? Geometry tells us, That that can|not be; one half then of that &s;pace, ought nece&s;&s;arily to have remained void, &s;ee|ing there were as yet no <HI>Atomes</HI> to fill it.</P>
<P>My Philo&s;opher made me an&s;wer, That <HI>Mon&s;ieur des Cartes</HI> him&s;elf would give us
<PB N="175" REF="162"> a rea&s;on for that; and that being an ob|liging Gentleman, as well as a Philo&s;opher, he would certainly be overjoyed to find a mortal Man in this World, that he might clear him of an Hundred Doubts, which his unexpected Death had con&s;trained him to leave in the Earth, that now he had for|&s;aken: That he did not think though, there was any great difficulty to an&s;wer that ob|jection, according to his Principles which I had not examined, but as far as the weak|ne&s;s of my Wit could permit me; becau&s;e, &s;aid he, the Works of that great Man, are &s;o full and &s;o &s;ubtile, that to under&s;tand them, there is need of the attention of the Soul of a true and con&s;ummated Philo&s;o|pher: Which is the rea&s;on, that there is not a Philo&s;opher in the Sun, but has a Venera|tion from him, in&s;omuch that they will not di&s;pute him the Precedency, if his mo|de&s;ty &s;uffer him to take it.</P>
<P>To ea&s;e the trouble that the length of this Journey may give you, we will di&s;|cour&s;e of his Philo&s;ophy according to his Principles; which undoubtedly are &s;o clear, and &s;eem &s;o abundantly &s;atisfactory, through the admirable Wit of that great Ge|nius, that one would &s;ay, He had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the lovely and magnificent Structure of this Univer&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="163"> You remember, he &s;aith, that our Un|der&s;tanding is Finite; &s;o Matter being divi|&s;ible <HI>in infinitum,</HI> it is not to be doubted, but that is one of the things, that it can neither imagine nor conceive; and that it is far above the reach of the Intellect, to give you a Rea&s;on for it: But, &s;aid he, though that cannot fall under the Sen&s;es, yet we conceive that it is &s;o, by the know|ledge we have of Matter; and we ought not, &s;aid he, &s;u&s;pend our Judgments a|bout things that we conceive. Can we imagine the manner how the Soul acts up|on the Body? Neverthele&s;s, that is a truth not to be denied, nor doubted of; whereas it is a far greater ab&s;urdity to attribute to a <HI>Vacuity,</HI> that quality of yeilding to a Body, and that Space, which are the dependances of an Extent, which can only agree to a Sub&s;tance; &s;eeing by &s;o doing one would confound the Notion of
<HI>Nothing</HI> with that of a <HI>Being,</HI> and give Qualities to that, which can produce nothing, and cannot be the Author of any thing what&s;oever. But, poor Mortal, &s;aid he, I perceive that the&s;e Speculations are tedious to thee; becau&s;e as that Excellent Man &s;aith, Thou ha&s;t never taken pains enough, to purifie thy Spirits from the ma&s;s of thy Body; and becau&s;e thou ha&s;t rendred it &s;o lazy, that it will per|form no Functions now, without the aid of Sen&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="163"> I was about to reply, when he pulled me by the Arm, to &s;hew me a Valley of won|derful Beauty. Do you perceive, &s;aid he to me, that bottom we are going down in|to? One would &s;ay, that the tops of the little Hills that bound it, were purpo&s;ely Crown'd with Trees, that by the cool of their Shade, they would invite Travellers to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the foot of one of the&s;e Hills, the Lake of Sleep takes its &s;ource; it con&s;i&s;ts only of the Liquor of five Fountains, and if it mingled not with Three Rivers, and by its weight dulled the &s;tream of their Waters, no Ani|mal of our World could &s;leep. I cannot expre&s;s how impatient I was to que&s;tion him, about the&s;e Three Rivers, which I had never heard of before; but I was &s;atis|fied when he told me, that I &s;hould &s;ee all.</P>
<P>Soon after we arrived in the Valley, and much about the &s;ame time, upon the Carpet that borders that great Lake.</P>
<P>The truth is, &s;aid <HI>Campanella</HI> to me, you are happy, in that you &s;ee before you die, all the wonders of this World; it's a ble&s;&s;ing for the Inhabitants of your Globe, that it hath produced a Man, who can in|form them of the marvels of the Sun; &s;eeing without you, they were in danger of living in gro&s;s Ignorance, and of ta&s;ting a thou&s;and
<PB N="178" REF="164"> Plea&s;ures, without knowing whence they come; for it cannot be imagined, how li|berally the Sun be&s;tows his Large&s;&s;es, upon all your little Globes: and this Valley a|lone, diffu&s;es an infinite nnmber of Ble&s;|&s;ings, throughout the whole Univer&s;e, with|out which you could not live, nor &s;o much as &s;ee the Day: Methinks that the &s;ight of this Country alone, is enough to make you confe&s;s, that the Sun is your Father, and that he is the Author of all things. The&s;e Five little Rivers, that come and di&s;charge them&s;elves in it, run not above Fifteen or Sixteen hours; and neverthele&s;s they &s;eem to be &s;o weary when they arrive, that hard|ly can they move; but they expre&s;s their La&s;&s;itude by very different effects, for that of Sight contracts its &s;elf proportionably, as it approaches to the Lake of Sleep. The Hearing at its Mouth, confounds, wan|ders, and loo&s;es it &s;elf in the Pool: The Smelling rai&s;es a murmur, like that of a Man who &s;nores: The Ta&s;te growing wallowi&s;h by the way, becomes altogether in&s;ipid: And the Feeling, &s;o powerful a little before, that he lodged all his Comrades, is fain to conceal his own abode. On his part the Nymph of Peace, who re&s;ides in the mid|dle of the Lake, with open Arms receives his gue&s;ts, lays them in her Bed, and dandles them &s;o gingerly, that to make them &s;leep,
<PB N="179" REF="164"> &s;he her &s;elf takes the pains to rock the Cra|dle. After they have for &s;ome time been thus confounded in this va&s;t Ba&s;on, they again divide them&s;elves at the further end, into Five Rivulets, which re&s;ume the &s;ame names when they i&s;&s;ue out, that they left when they entered: But tho&s;e which ha&s;ten mo&s;t to be gone, and tug their Compani|ons to &s;et out, are the Hearing and Feel|ing; for the other Three wait, till the&s;e awaken them, and of all the re&s;t the Ta&s;te lags always hindmo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Lake of Sleep is Vaulted over, with the black Arch of a <HI>Grotto.</HI> A great ma|ny Tortoi&s;es march &s;lowly about the Shore; the Flowers of a Thou&s;and Poppies, by looking into the Water, communicate to it its drouzy virtue. Not &s;o much as <HI>Dormice,</HI> but come above Fifty Leagues to drink in it; and the purling of the Stream is &s;o charming, that it would &s;eem to break upon the Pebbles with Cadence, and to endeavour to compo&s;e Soporifick Mu|&s;ick.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;e <HI>Campanella</HI> without doubt fore&s;aw, that I was about to feel the effects of it, and therefore he advi&s;ed me to mend my pace. I would have obey|ed him, but the Charms of that Water had &s;o enveigled my Rea&s;on, that hardly could I under&s;tand his la&s;t Words. Sleep
<PB N="180" REF="165"> on, then, &s;leep on, I give you leave, &s;aid he; and indeed the Dreams that one has here are &s;o perfect, that you'll be glad one day to call to mind, that which you are about to have. In the mean time, I'll di|vert my &s;elf in viewing the Rarities of the place, and then come back to you a|gain. I think he talked no more, or at lea&s;t the Vapours of &s;leep, had already put me out of condition, of being able to hear him.</P>
<P>I was in the middle of the learnede&s;t and be&s;t conceived Dream that ever was, when my Philo&s;opher came to awake me. I'll tell it you, when I can without digre&s;&s;ion; for it is very important you &s;hould know it, to let you &s;ee, with what freedom the Mind of the Inhabitants of the Sun acts, whil&s;t Sleep captivates their Sen&s;es. For my part, I think, that that Lake evapo|rates an Air, which hath the property of depurating the Mind, entirely from the Fogs of the Sen&s;es; for nothing is pre&s;ented to your thoughts, which does not &s;eem to perfect and in&s;truct you; and that's the rea&s;on why I highly re&s;pect tho&s;e Philo|&s;ophers, that are called Dreamers, who are laught at by the ignorant.</P>
<P>I opened then my Eyes with a &s;tart: I fancy I heard him &s;aying; Mortal, you have &s;lept enough, ri&s;e, if you would &s;ee
<PB N="181" REF="165"> a Rarity that can never be imagined in your World. During the &s;pace of an hour, or thereabouts, &s;ince I left you; I have been walking by the Five Fountains, which come out of the Lake of Sleep. You may believe, that I have con&s;idered them with a great deal of Attention; they bear the name of the Five Sen&s;es, and glide very near one to another: That of the Sight &s;eems to be a forked Pipe, full of the Powder of Dia|monds, and little Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, that &s;teal away and re&s;tore the Image of what|ever pre&s;ents; in its cour&s;e it incompa&s;&s;es the Kingdom of <HI>Linx:</HI> That of the Hear|ing is in like manner double; it turns by its In&s;inuations like a <HI>Dedalus,</HI> and from the mo&s;t hollow concavity of its Bed, one may hear an Eccho of all the noi&s;e that &s;ounds round about: I am much mi&s;taken, if they were not Foxes that I &s;aw picking their Ears there: That of Smelling &s;eems like the former, to divide it &s;elf into two Chan|nels, hid under one and the &s;ame Arch; out of every thing it meets, it extracts &s;omewhat invi&s;ible, whereof it compo&s;es a Thou&s;and &s;ort of Odours, which &s;tand it in &s;tead of Water; on the brink of that &s;ource, there are a great many Dogs, that rub and clean&s;e their No&s;es. That of the Ta&s;te runs by &s;purts, which commonly happen not above Three or Four times a
<PB N="182" REF="166"> Day, and for that too a large van of Co|ral mu&s;t be rai&s;ed, and underneath that a great many little ones of Ivory; its Li|quor re&s;embles Spittle: But as to the Fifth, that of Feeling, it is &s;o large and deep, that it environs all its Si&s;ters, nay, and lays it &s;elf out at length in their Channels, and its thick Juyce, &s;heds it &s;elf abroad upon the green Turff, covered with &s;en&s;i|tive Plants.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, that &s;tunned with Veneration, I admired the my&s;teri|ous Turnings of all the&s;e Fountains: When after a great walk, I came to the entry where they di&s;charged them&s;elves into Three Rivers: But follow me, you'll bet|ter conceive the di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e things when you &s;ee them. A Promi&s;e that plea&s;|ed me &s;o well, throughly awoke me; I &s;tretched out my Arm to him, and we kept the &s;ame way he had followed, walk|ing along the Dykes that keep the Five Ri|vulets in their &s;everal Channels.</P>
<P>When we had gone about a Furlong, &s;ome|thing as clear as a Lake pre&s;ented it &s;elf to our Eyes. No &s;ooner had the Wi&s;e
<HI>Cam|panella</HI> perceived it, but he told me: At length, Son, we are got to the Port, I di&s;tinctly &s;ee the three Rivers.</P>
<P>I was &s;o briskly tran&s;ported with that news, that I thought I was become an
<PB N="183" REF="166"> Eagle. I flew rather than walked, and ran all about with &s;o greedy a Curio&s;ity, that in le&s;s than an hour, my Guide and I ob&s;erved what now you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>Three great Rivers water the Fields of this Burning World: The Fir&s;t and larg|e&s;t is called Memory; the Second, narrower, but deeper, Imagination; and the Third, the la&s;t of the Three, is called Judgment.</P>
<P>Upon the Banks of Memory, one may hear continually a trouble&s;ome chattering of Jays, Parrots, Magpies, Starlings, Lin|nets, Chaffinches, and of all &s;orts of Birds, that chirp what they have learnt. In the Night time they are &s;ilent, for then they are taken up in feeding upon that thick Va|pour, which exhales from the&s;e watery places; but their foul Stomack dige&s;ts it &s;o ill, that in the Morning, when they think it con|verted into their &s;ub&s;tance, it drops out of their Beak again, as clear as it was in the River.</P>
<P>The Water of that River &s;eems to be clammy, and runs with much noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ecchos that are formed in its Caverns repeat the word, even to above a Thou&s;and times: It breeds a kind of Mon&s;ters, who have a Face much like to that of a Woman. It hath others too more furious, who have a Square and Horned Head, not unlike to that of our Pedants. The whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="184" REF="167"> the&s;e is to cry, and neverthele&s;s &s;ay no more but what they have heard one another &s;ay before.</P>
<P>The River of Imagination runs more gently; its light and &s;hining Liquor &s;parkles on all hands: To look upon that Water like a Torrent of humide &s;parkles, one would think, that it ob&s;erved no Or|der in its cour&s;e. After I had con&s;idered it more attentively; I ob&s;erved that the hu|mour which flowed in its Channel, was of pure Potable Gold, and its froth of the Oyl of Talc. The Fi&s;h that it feeds are <HI>Re|moras, Syrenes</HI> and <HI>Salamanders;</HI> in&s;tead of Gravel, it is full of tho&s;e little Stones <HI>Pli|ny</HI> &s;peaks of, with which Men become hea|vy, when they touch their wrong &s;ide, and light when they apply to them their Right &s;ide. I ob&s;erved there al&s;o tho&s;e other Stones, one of which <HI>Giges</HI> had in a ring, which render things Invi&s;ible; but above all, there are a great many Philo&s;ophers &s;tones, which &s;parkle among&s;t its Sand. There were a great many Fruit-Trees up|on the banks of it, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which <HI>Mahomet</HI> found in Paradi&s;e; their Branches &s;warmed with Phenixes, and I ob&s;erved Crab-Stocks of that Tree, from which
<HI>Di&s;cord</HI> pluckt the Apple which &s;he threw among&s;t the three Godde&s;&s;es; graffs of the Garden of the <HI>He&s;perides</HI> had been graffed on
<PB N="185" REF="167"> them. Each of the&s;e Two great Rivers, is divided into an infinite number of Branches, that are interlaced one with another; and I took notice, that when a great Rivulet of Memory, drew near to a le&s;s of Imaginati|on, it immediately ab&s;orbed the other; but on the contrary, if the Rivulet of Imagi|nation was the bigger, it dried up the Brook of Memory. Now &s;eeing the&s;e Three Rivers, both in their Channels and Bran|ches, run always by one another; where|&s;oever the Memory is &s;trong, the Imagina|tion dimini&s;hes; and this again &s;wells, as the other is low.</P>
<P>Near to that the River of Judgment runs with an incredible &s;lowne&s;s: It hath a deep Channel, its Liquor &s;eems to be cold; and when it is &s;hed upon any thing, it drys in&s;tead of moi&s;tening. In the Owze of its Channel grow Hellebore-Plants, who&s;e Roots &s;tretching out in long Filaments, e|ven to the Mouth of it, purifie its Waters there: It breeds Serpents, and upon the &s;oft gra&s;s that cover its banks, Thou&s;ands of Elephants repo&s;e them&s;elves: It is divi|ded, as the other two, into an infinite num|ber of little Branches; it encrea&s;es as it ad|vances in its cour&s;e: and though it &s;till gains ground, yet it continually ebbs and flows in it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="168"> All the Sun is watered by the Juyce of the&s;e Three Rivers; it &s;erves to &s;teep the burning Atomes of tho&s;e that die in that great World; but this de&s;erves very well to be handled more largely.</P>
<P>The Life of the Animals of the Sun is very long, and they expire not but by a na|tural Death, which only happens at the end of Seven or Eight thou&s;and Years; when by the continued Inten&s;ion of mind, to which their fiery temper inclines them, the order of matter is jumbled; for in a Body, &s;o &s;oon as Nature perceives, that it would require more time to repair the Anti|ent Being, than to compo&s;e a new one, &s;he a&s;pires to Di&s;&s;olution; &s;o that the Ani|mal may be &s;een daily not to Rot, but to fall into Particles like Red A&s;hes.</P>
<P>Death never happens but in this manner. The Animal then being expired, or, to &s;ay better, extinct; the little igneous Bo|dies that made up his &s;ub&s;tance, enter into the gro&s;s matter of this burning World, until Chance hath watered them with the Liquor of the Three Rivers; for then be|coming moveable by their Fluidity, that they may quickly exert the Faculties, of which that Water hath given them an ob|&s;cure Knowledge, they fa&s;ten together into threads, and by a Flux of Luminous points, &s;harpen them&s;elves into Beams, and then
<PB N="187" REF="168"> di&s;per&s;e into the Neighbouring Spheres; where they are no &s;ooner wafted, but they them&s;elves di&s;po&s;e the matter, as much as they can, into a Form proper for the exert|ing all the functions, whereof they have contracted an In&s;tinct, in the Water of the Three Rivers, the Five Fountains, and the Lake; and therefore they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be attracted to Plants for Vegetation; the Plants &s;uffer them&s;elves to be brouzed upon by Animals for Sen&s;ation; and the Animals &s;uffer them&s;elves to be eaten by Men; that &s;o being converted into their &s;ub&s;tance, they may repair the Three Fa|culties of Memory, Imagination and Judg|ment, of who&s;e power the Rivers of the Sun, had given them a Fore-ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Now according as the Atomes have been more or le&s;s &s;oaked, in the Liquor of the&s;e Three Rivers; they furni&s;h Animals with more or le&s;s Memory, Imagination or Judgment; and according as in the Three Rivers, they have inbibed more or le&s;s, of the Liquor of the Five Fountains, and of the Lake, they form to them Sen&s;es more or le&s;s perfect, and produce Souls more or le&s;s drowzy.</P>
<P>This is in a manner what we ob&s;erved, concerning the nature of the&s;e Three Ri|vers. Little &s;cattered veines of them may be met with every where; but as for the
<PB N="188" REF="169"> principal Branches, they run with a &s;treight cour&s;e to the Province of Philo&s;ophers: And therefore we returned to the high way again, not leaving the Current wide of us, farther than it was nece&s;&s;ary to get upon the Cau&s;ey. We &s;aw the Three great Rivers always running by our &s;ide; but for the Five Fountains, we beheld them turning and winding below in the Mea|dows. That's a very plea&s;ant Road, though it be &s;olitary; the Air there is pure and thin, which nouri&s;hes the Soul, and makes it reign over the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>At the end of Five or Six days Journey, as we were diverting our &s;ight, with the various and rich Pro&s;pects of the Country, we heard a langui&s;hing Voice, like the groaning of a &s;ick Per&s;on. We drew near the place, from whence we judged it might come, and found upon the brink of the River Imagination, an old Man fallen backwards, who complained grievou&s;ly. Tears of compa&s;&s;ion came into my Eyes, and Pity obliged me to ask the poor wretch what he ailed. That Man, an&s;wered <HI>Campanella,</HI> turning towards me, is a Phi|lo&s;opher reduced to Extremity: For we die oftner than once; and &s;eeing we are but parts of this Univer&s;e, we change our form, that we may go Live el&s;ewhere; which is not a Misfortune, &s;ince it is a
<PB N="189" REF="169"> way to perfect ones Being, and to attain to an infinite number of Sciences: His di|&s;temper is that, which makes all great Men for the mo&s;t part to die.</P>
<P>His Di&s;cour&s;e obliged me to con&s;ider the Patient more attentively, and at the fir&s;t glance, I perceived that his Head was as big as a Tun, and open in many places. Come, come, &s;aid <HI>Campanella</HI> to me, pul|ling me by the Arm, all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that we may think we could give to this dying Man, would be unprofitable, and only trouble him the more. Let's Jog on, for indeed his Evil is Incurable: The Swelling of his Head, proceeds from the Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his Mind; for though the Ideas, wherewith he has filled the Three Organs, or the Three Ventricles of his Brain, be but very &s;mall Images; yet they are Corporeal, and by con&s;equence capable of filling a great place, when they are very numerous. Now you mu&s;t know, That that Philo&s;opher hath &s;o dilated his brain, by &s;tuffing it with notion upon notion, that being unable longer to contain them, it hath bur&s;t. That way of dying is common to great Genies, and it is called, To crack with Wit.</P>
<P>We marched on &s;till di&s;cour&s;ing; and what pre&s;ented fir&s;t to our view, furni&s;h|ed us with matter of Conver&s;ation. I &s;hould have been very willing though, to
<PB N="190" REF="170"> have left the ob&s;cure Regions of the Sun, and gone again into the Luminous; for the Reader mu&s;t know, That all the Coun|tries are not Diaphanous, there are &s;ome of them that are ob&s;cure, like tho&s;e of our World; and which, were it not for the light of the Sun, that is perceived beyond them, would be covered with Darkne&s;s. Now proportionably as one enters into the ob|&s;cure Regions, he in&s;en&s;ibly becomes &s;o him&s;elf; and in the &s;ame manner, when one approaches the tran&s;parent, he per|ceives him&s;elf &s;tript of that &s;omber Ob|&s;curity, by the vigorous Irradiation of the Climate.</P>
<P>I remember, that upon occa&s;ion of this earne&s;t de&s;ire I had, I asked <HI>Campanella,</HI> if the Province of Philo&s;ophers was re&s;plen|dent or darki&s;h? It is more darki&s;h than re&s;plendent, an&s;wered he: For as we &s;till Sympathize much with the Earth, our na|tive Country, which of its own nature is Opacous; &s;o we could not fit our &s;elves in the clearer Regions of this Globe. Ne|verthele&s;s by a vigorous bending of the Will, we can render our &s;elves Diaphanous, when we have a mind to it: Nay, and mo&s;t part of the Philo&s;ophers, do not &s;peak with the Tongue, but when they have a mind to communicate their Thoughts, they purge them&s;elves by the Ejaculations
<PB N="191" REF="170"> of their Fancy, of a &s;omber Vapour, under which commonly they keep their Concep|tions covered; and &s;o &s;oon as they have remanded to its place, that ob&s;curity of the Spleen which darkened them, &s;eeing their Body is then Diaphanous, one may per|ceive through their Brain what they re|member, what they imagine, what they judge; and in their Liver and Heart, what they de&s;ire, and what they re&s;olve: For though the&s;e little Pictures be more im|perceptible, than any thing that we can devi&s;e; yet in this World our Eyes are clear|&s;ighted enough, ea&s;ily to di&s;tingui&s;h even the &s;malle&s;t Ideas.</P>
<P>Thus when any of us would di&s;cover to his Friend, the Affection he has for him, his Heart is perceived to dart out Beams, as far as his Memory, upon the Image of him he Loves: And when on the contra|ry, he would te&s;tifie his Aver&s;ion, his Heart is &s;een to Thunder again&s;t the Image of him he hates, &s;torms of burning Sparks, and to retreat backward as far as it can: In the &s;ame manner when he &s;peaks with|in him&s;elf, the Ideas are clearly to be ob|&s;erved, that's to &s;ay, The Characters of every thing he meditates upon, which by ri&s;ing and falling, imprinting and effacing, pre&s;ent to the Eyes of the Beholder, not an articulated Di&s;cour&s;e, but a Hi&s;tory of all his thoughts in <HI>taille-doux.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="171"> My Guide would have gone on, but he was diverted by an Accident, the like was never heard before: And that was, that all of a &s;udden we perceived the Earth blacken|ed under our Feet, and the Heavens kindled before with Beams, extingui&s;hed over head, as if a Canopy Four Leagues broad, had been &s;pread betwixt us and the Sun.</P>
<P>It would be no ea&s;ie matter for me to expre&s;s, what we imagined in that Jun|cture: All &s;orts of Terrors, even that of the Worlds end, &s;eized us, and none of the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions &s;eemed to us to be impro|bable; for to &s;ee night in the Sun, or the Air overca&s;t with Clouds, is a Mi|racle that never happens there. And yet this was not all; for immediately after a &s;harp and skreaking noi&s;e, like to that of the winding up of a Jack, came to grate our Ears; and at the very &s;ame time a Cage fell at our Feet. No &s;ooner had it re&s;ted upon the Sand, but it opened, and was brought to bed of a Man and a Woman; they had an Anchor with them, which they fa&s;tened to the Roots of a Rock; the next thing they did, was to make towards us. The Woman led the Man, and with threats dragged him forward. When &s;he was come very near us, Gentlemen, &s;aid &s;he, in &s;ome little di&s;order, Is not this the Province of Philo&s;ophers? I made an&s;wer, No; but
<PB N="193" REF="171"> that we hoped to be there within the &s;pace of Four and twenty hours; and that the old Man, who allowed me his Company, was one of the chief Mini&s;ters of that Mo|narchy. Seeing you are a Philo&s;opher, repli|ed the Woman, addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to <HI>Cam|panella,</HI> without going further, I mu&s;t di&s;|charge my heart to you.</P>
<P>To tell you then in a few Words, the oc|ca&s;ion of my coming hither, you mu&s;t know, that I come to complain of a Mur|der committed on the per&s;on of the Young|e&s;t of my Children; the Barbarian, whom I hold here, hath twice kill'd him, though he be the Father. We were extreamly puzled at this Di&s;cour&s;e, and therefore I de&s;ired to know, what &s;he meant by a Child killed twice? Know, an&s;&s;ered the Woman, that in our Country, among&s;t the other Statutes of Love, there is a Law regulates the num|ber of Ki&s;&s;es, which a Husband is obliged to give his Wife: And it's for that rea&s;on, that every evening a Phy&s;ician, within his own precinct, vi&s;its all the Hou&s;es, where having viewed the Husband and Wife, he taxes them for that night, accord|ing to their Health, &s;trong or weak, in more or le&s;s Embraces. Now my Hus|band there was adjudged to Seven: Never|thele&s;s, being netled at &s;ome angry words I gave him, as we were going to Bed, he
<PB N="194" REF="172"> did not &s;o much as touch me, all the while we were in bed: But God, who avenges the cau&s;e of the afflicted, permitted, That that Wretch being tickled in a dream, by remembring the Ki&s;&s;es, which he unju&s;tly detained from me, let a Man be lo&s;t. I told you, that his Father hath killed him twice, becau&s;e by hindering him to be, he is the cau&s;e that he is not, there is his fir&s;t Murder; and he is likewi&s;e the cau&s;e, why he hath not been, there's his &s;econd: Whereas an ordinary Murderer knows very well, that he whom he de&s;troys, is no more in being; but he cannot hinder, but that he hath had a Being. Our Magi&s;trates would have rendred Ju&s;tice in the matter; but the Crafty Man alledged for excu&s;e, That he would have performed his conju|gal Duty, had he not been apprehen&s;ive, that ki&s;&s;ing me in the rage that I had put him into, he might have begot a Mad|man.</P>
<P>The Senate puzled at that Plea, orde|red us to go and appear before the Philo|&s;ophers, and plead our Cau&s;e there. So &s;oon as we received the Order to be gone, we put or &s;elves into a Cage, hung by the Neck of that great Fowl, which you &s;ee there; from whence by means of a Pully which we fa&s;tned to it, we let our &s;elves down to the ground, and hoi&s;t our &s;elves
<PB N="195" REF="172"> up into the Air. There are people in our Province, purpo&s;ely appointed to tame them when they are young, and breed them up to the work we employ them in. That which chiefly makes them tractable, contrary to their fierce nature, is, that to &s;atisfie their un&s;atiable Hunger, we give them the Bo|dies of all the Bea&s;ts that die to feed on. After all, when we have a mind to &s;leep, (for becau&s;e of the con&s;tant exce&s;&s;es of Love, which weaken us, we &s;tand in need of Re&s;t:) We let loo&s;e into the open Fields, at convenient di&s;tances, Twenty or Thirty of the&s;e Fowls, each tied to a rope, who tak|ing flight with their great Wings, di&s;play in the Sky a Night larger than the Hori|zon. I was very attentive both to her Di&s;cour&s;e, and in great exta&s;ie, to con&s;i|der the prodigious bulk of that Giant-Bird: But &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Campanella</HI> had lookt a little upon it, Ha! verily, cried he, it is one of tho&s;e Feathered Mon&s;ters called
<HI>Condores,</HI> which are to be &s;een in the I&s;le of <HI>Mandragora</HI> in our World, and all over the Torrid Zone, they cover an Acre of ground with their Wings: But &s;eeing the&s;e Animals grow Huger, according as the Sun, under which they are bred, is hotter in the World of the Sun, they mu&s;t needs be of a prodigious Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="173"> However, added he turning to the Wo|man, you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity accompli&s;h your Journey; for it belongs to <HI>Socrates,</HI> who hath the in&s;pection of Manners, to decide your Cau&s;e. In the mean time, I ad|jure you to tell us, what Country you are of, becau&s;e &s;eeing it is but three or four years, &s;ince I arrived in this World, I am but very little as yet acquainted with the Map of it?</P>
<P>We are, an&s;wered &s;he, of the Kingdom of Lovers: That great State is on one &s;ide bordered by the Republick of Peace, and on the other, by that of the Ju&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Country I come from, at Sixteen years of Age, Boys are put into the Novitiat of Love: It is a very &s;tately Palace, that takes up almo&s;t a quarter of the City. The Maids are put into it at Thirteen; and both accompli&s;h their year of Probation there; during which the Boys are only employed, in meriting the affection of the Girls, and the Girls in rendring them&s;elves worthy of the Love of the Boys. When the Twelve Months are up, the faculty of medicine in Body, go and vi&s;it this Seminary of Lo|vers: They feel them all over, one after another, even to the mo&s;t Privy parts of their Body; make them couple before them; and then according as the Male, upon Tryal, is found to be vigorous and
<PB N="197" REF="173"> well-&s;haped, they give him for Wives, Ten, Twenty, Thirty or Forty Maids, &s;uch as loved him; provided he reciprocally love them. The Husband, neverthele&s;s, cannot lie but with Two at a time, and it is not lawful for him to Embrace any of them, &s;o long as &s;he is with Child. Such as are found to be Barren, are only employ|ed in Service; and Men who are impotent are made Slaves, and may carnally mingle with the Female-Drudges. After all, when a Family hath more Children than it can bring up, the Republick takes care of them: But that's a misfortune that very &s;eldom happens; becau&s;e &s;o &s;oon as a Woman is brought to Bed in the City, the publick Trea&s;ury furni&s;hes a yearly Pen&s;ion for the Education of the Child, according to its Quality; which on certain days, the Trea|&s;urers of State them&s;elves, carry to the Hou&s;e of the Father: But if you have a mind to know more, &s;tep into our Pan|nier, it is big enough for Four. Seeing we are going the &s;ame way, we'll talk and make our Journey the &s;horter.</P>
<P><HI>Campanella</HI> was of the mind, that we &s;hould embrace the offer; and I was like|wi&s;e very glad of it, to avoid being tired: But when I came to help them to weigh their Anchor, I was much &s;urprized to find, that in&s;tead of a great Cable, which ought
<PB N="198" REF="174"> to bear it up, it hung only by a Silken thread as &s;mall as a Hair. I asked <HI>Campanella</HI> how it could be, that a Ma&s;s &s;o heavy as that Anchor was, did not by its weight break &s;o weak a thing? And the good Man made an&s;wer, That that Line did not break, becau&s;e being &s;pun all of an equal bigne&s;s, there was no rea&s;on why it &s;hould &s;ooner break, at one place than another. We all &s;towed our&s;elves into the Pannier, and then hoi&s;ted up our &s;elves by the Pully, as high as the Fowl's Throat, where we appeared no bigger than a Bead hanging at its Neck. When we were up as high as the Pully, we fa&s;tened the Cable by which our Cage hung, to one of its &s;malle&s;t Down-feathers, which neverthele&s;s was as big as ones Thumb; and &s;o &s;oon as the Woman, had made a &s;ign to the Bird to be gone, we perceived it cleave the Air with a violent Rapidity. The
<HI>Condore</HI> ha&s;tned or &s;lackened its flight, &s;oared or &s;tooped, according to its Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es plea&s;ure, who&s;e Voice &s;erved it for a Bridle. We had not flow'n Two hundred Leagues, when we perceived on the Earth, to the le&s;t Hand, a night like to that, which our living Umbrello made under us. We asked the &s;tranger Woman, what &s;he thought it might be? It's another Malefactor, an&s;wered &s;he, who is going al&s;o to receive Ju&s;tice in the Province, whi|ther
<PB N="199" REF="174"> we are going: His Fowl, without doubt, is &s;tronger than ours, or otherwi&s;e we have trifled away a great deal of time by the way, for he &s;et not out till after I was gone. I asked her, what Crime that poor Wretch was accu&s;ed of? He is not barely accu&s;ed, an&s;wered &s;he; he is con|demned to dye, becau&s;e he is already con|victed of not being afraid of Death. How then, &s;aid <HI>Campanella</HI> to her, do the Laws of your Country enjoyn Men to be afraid of Death? Yes, replied the Woman, they enjoyn all, except tho&s;e who are admitted into the Colledge of the Wi&s;e; for our Magi&s;trates have found by &s;ad Experience, that he who fears not to lo&s;e Life, may take it from any Body el&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;es that followed the&s;e,
<HI>Campanella</HI> had a mind to make a larger enquiry into the Manners of her Country: He asked her then, what were the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom of Lovers? But &s;he begged his pardon, if &s;he did not an&s;wer him; becau&s;e &s;ince &s;he was not born there, and knew them but in part, &s;he was afraid, &s;he might &s;ay too much or too little. I came into that Province, con|tinued the Woman; but I and all my Pro|dece&s;&s;ors, are originally of the Kingdom of Truth; my Mother was delivered of me there, and never had another Child; &s;he
<PB N="200" REF="175"> brought me up in the Country, till I was Thirteen Years of Age, when the King by the advice of Phy&s;icians, commanded her to carry me to the Kingdom of Lovers, from whence I come; to the end, that having my Breeding in the Palace of Love, that Education which is more chearful and &s;oft, than the Breeding of our Country, might render me more Fruitful than &s;he had been. My Mother carried me thither, and placed me out into that Hou&s;e of Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>I had much ado to comply with their Cu&s;toms: At fir&s;t they appeared to me to be very rude; for, as you know, the opi|nions that we have &s;uckt in with our Mo|thers Milk, &s;eem always to us to be the mo&s;t rational; and then I was but ju&s;t come from the Kingdom of Truth, my native Country.</P>
<P>Not but that I perceived very well, that the Nation of Lovers, lived with more Con|de&s;cen&s;ion and Indulgence, than ours did; for though every one gave it out, That my Sight wounded dangerou&s;ly, that my Looks killed, and that my Eyes glanced out Flames, which con&s;umed Hearts; yet the Goodne&s;s of all, and e&s;pecially of the Young Men, was &s;o great, that they car|re&s;&s;ed, ki&s;&s;ed and hugg'd me, in&s;tead of revenging the Evil that I had done them.
<PB N="201" REF="175"> Nay, I was even vexed with my &s;elf, for the di&s;orders that I was the cau&s;e of; and that was the rea&s;on, that out of Pity I told them one day, That I was re&s;olved to run away. But alas! how can you &s;ave your &s;elf, cry|ed they all, embracing my Neck, and ki&s;&s;ing my Hands: Your Hou&s;e is on all Hands be&s;et with Water; and &s;o great the danger appears to be, that undoubtedly you and we both had been already drowned, without a Miracle.</P>
<P>How, &s;aid I to our Hi&s;torian, is the Country of Lovers then &s;ubject to Inunda|tions? It may very well be &s;aid to be, re|plied &s;he; for one of my Gallants (and that Man would not have deceived me, be|cau&s;e he loved me) wrote to me, That for grief of my departure, he had &s;hed an Ocean of Tears. I &s;aw another who a&s;&s;u|red me, That within the &s;pace of three days, his Eyes had di&s;tilled a Fountain of Water: And as I was cur&s;ing, for their &s;akes, the fatal Hour when fir&s;t they &s;aw me, one who reckoned him&s;elf of the num|ber of my Slaves, &s;ent me word, that the night before, an overflowing of his Eyes, had cau&s;ed a Deluge. I was about to have left the World, that I might no longer be the cau&s;e of &s;o many Evils, had not the Me&s;&s;enger &s;ubjoined, that his Ma&s;ter had charged him to a&s;&s;ure me, That I had no
<PB N="202" REF="176"> cau&s;e to fear any thing, &s;eeing the Fur|nace of his Brea&s;t, had dried up that De|luge. In fine, you may Conjecture how wateri&s;h the Kingdom of Lovers mu&s;t needs be, &s;ince with them it is to weep but by halves; when from under their Eye-lids, there &s;prings no more but Rivulets, Foun|tains and Torrents.</P>
<P>I was in great pain, what Machine I could find, to &s;ave my &s;elf out of all the&s;e Wa|ters, that were like to over-whelm me: But one of my Lovers, who was called <HI>The Jealous,</HI> advi&s;ed me to pluck out my Heart, and then embark in it; that I needed not fear, but that it would hold me, becau&s;e it held &s;o many others; nor that I &s;hould &s;ink, becau&s;e it was too light: That all I was to be afraid of, was to be burnt, becau&s;e the Materials of &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, was much &s;ubject to Fire: That I &s;hould be gone then upon the Sea of his Tears; that the Fillet of his Love, would &s;erve me for a Sail; and that the favourable Gale of his Sighs, in &s;pight of his Rivals Storm, would carry me to Shoar.</P>
<P>I was a long while a mu&s;ing with my &s;elf, how I could put that enterpri&s;e into execution. The natural Fearfulne&s;s of my fex, hindred me from daring; but at length the opinion that I had, that if the thing were not fea&s;ible, a Man would not
<PB N="203" REF="176"> be &s;uch a Fool as to advi&s;e it, and far le&s;s a Lover to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, gave me the Bold|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;natched a knife, &s;lit up my Brea&s;t; nay, with both my hands I was already &s;earching in the wound, and with an un|daunted look, I felt for my Heart to pluck it out, when a Young Man, who loved me, came in. In &s;pight of me he wre&s;ted the Weapon from me, and then asked me the motive of that de&s;perate Action, as he called it. I gave him an account of it; but was much &s;urprized, when within a quarter of an hour after, I under&s;tood that he had brought the <HI>Jealous</HI> before the Ju&s;tice. Neverthele&s;s the Magi&s;trates, who, perhaps, feared they might be bia&s;&s;ed by the example or novelty of the Acci|dent, referred that Cau&s;e to the Parliament of the Ju&s;t. There he was Condemned, be&s;ides perpetual Bani&s;hment, to go end his Days as a Slave, in the Land of the
<HI>Re|publick</HI> of <HI>Truth;</HI> with prohibition to all that &s;hould de&s;cend of him, to the Fourth Generation, ever to return into the Pro|vince of Lovers; nay, moreover he was enjoyned upon pain of Death, never more to u&s;e an Hyperbole.</P>
<P>Since that time I entertained a great affection for the Young Man that &s;aved me; and whether it were for that good
<PB N="204" REF="177"> Office, or becau&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ion, where|with he &s;erved me, when my Novitiat and his were out, I did not refu&s;e him, when he demanded me for one of his Wives.</P>
<P>We have always &s;ince lived very well together, and &s;hould have continued to do &s;o &s;till, had he not, as I have told you, killed one of my Children twice; for which I am going to emplore Ju&s;tice, in the King|dom of Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P><HI>Campanella</HI> and I were much a&s;toni&s;h|ed at the &s;ilence of that Man; and therefore I endeavoured to comfort him, judging, that &s;uch a profound Taciturnity, was the Daughter of a very deep Remor&s;e: But his Wife took me off of that. It is not, &s;aid &s;he, the exce&s;s of Sorrow that &s;tops his Mouth, but our Laws forbid all Criminals, that &s;tand Indited, to &s;peak unle&s;s it be before their Judges.</P>
<P>During that conver&s;ation, the Fowl was going on &s;till, but I was &s;trangely amazed when I heard <HI>Campanella,</HI> with a Coun|tenance full of tran&s;ports of Joy, cry out: Now welcome the deare&s;t of all our Friends: Let's go, Gentlemen, continu|ed the good Man, Let's go meet
<HI>Mon&s;i|eur Des Cartes;</HI> come let us alight, he is ju&s;t now arrived, and but Three Leagues off. For my part, I was exceeding|ly &s;urprized at this Eruption, for I could
<PB N="205" REF="177"> not comprehend, how he could come to know the arrival of a Man, of whom we had received no News. Cer|tainly, &s;aid I to him, you have ju&s;t now &s;een him in a Dream. If you call a Dream, &s;aid he, what your Soul can &s;ee with as great a certainty, as your Eyes &s;ee the light of Day; I confe&s;s it. But, cried I, is it not a Ravery to think, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur Des Cartes,</HI> whom you have not &s;een, &s;ince you left the World of the Earth, is now but Three Leagues off, becau&s;e you have imagined it to be &s;o?</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t uttered the la&s;t Syllable, when we &s;aw
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> come. Immediately <HI>Campanella</HI> ran to embrace him: They talked together a long while; but I could not mind all the obliging Complements they made to one another, I was &s;o full of de&s;ire to learn of
<HI>Campanella</HI> his Secret of Divination. That Philo&s;opher, who read my Pa&s;&s;ion in my looks, gave his Friend an account of it, and prayed him not to take ill if he &s;atisfied me. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Des Cartes</HI> an&s;wered with a &s;mile, and my learn|ed Preceptor di&s;cour&s;ed in this manner. Out of all Bodies <HI>Species</HI>'s exhale, that's to &s;ay, Corporeal Images, which dance in the Air. Now the&s;e Images &s;till retain, notwith&s;tanding their Agitation, the Fi|gure, Colour, and all the other Proporti|ons
<PB N="206" REF="178"> of the Object, from which they pro|ceed: But &s;eeing they are very pure and &s;ubtile, they pa&s;s through our Organs, without cau&s;ing the lea&s;t Sen&s;ation in them: They penetrate into the Soul, where becau&s;e of the Delicatene&s;s of its Sub&s;tance, they imprint them&s;elves, and &s;o repre&s;ent to it Objects very remote, which the Sen&s;es cannot perceive. It's a thing that commonly happens here, where the mind is not &s;hut up in a Body, made of gro&s;s Matter, as in thy World. We'll tell thee how that comes to pa&s;s, when we have had the lei&s;ure, fully to &s;atisfie the mutual De&s;ire, that each of us have, to conver&s;e with the other; for certainly thou well de&s;erve&s;t to be u&s;ed with the greate&s;t Civility.</P>
