<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> nature in general, their con|tempt

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_AS for the Situtaion of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI>
it is &s;o well known, that it
would be a needle&s;s labour
for me to &s;et it down; my
de&s;ign at pre&s;ent is to Survey
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e Religion and Manners of the Inhabi|tants.
And to this purpo&s;e, I have made a
<PB N="2" REF="14">
&s;lender E&s;&s;ay, the truth whereof, I hope,
will excu&s;e the plainne&s;s of the dre&s;s;
the &s;tuff is cour&s;e, and the thread not
fine&punc; but the matter I conceive will be
both plea&s;ant and profitable. Having
had therefore fair opportunities, and
good intelligence, I am the more wil|ling
to give you an account of this Em|pire.
Indeed, hitherto no man of parts
or abilities has been &s;uffered to travel the
Country. For the people are very jea|lous,
and &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e who ask them
any que&s;tions concerning their Policy,
or Religion, they being wholly devoted
to their own Ignorance, and Education;
(which is altogether illiterate, and rude,
both in Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs)
look upon Learning as a Mon&s;ter, and
fear it no le&s;s than a Ship of Wildfire;
and thus they verifie the old Saying,
<HI>Ars nullum habet inimicum praeter igno|rantem.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of our Lord, 1560. the
Art of Printing was brought in among&s;t
them (as <HI>Thevet</HI> relates in the life of <HI>Ba|&s;il)</HI>
and a Latin School al&s;o was erected,
but the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> &s;oon de&s;troyed it,
<HI>Vi &amp; Armis.</HI> I &s;hall therefore com|mence
<PB N="3" REF="14" MS="y">
my di&s;cour&s;e with them, who
are not &s;et apart for this Function, as in
other Nations, but any Lay-man of a
good life and conver&s;ation may take up|on
him the Prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>This Nation received the Chri&s;tian
Faith about &s;ix hundred years &s;ince, from
a certain Prie&s;t of <HI>Chioff,</HI> who is &s;aid to
cure one of the Dukes of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> by
prayer, upon which Miracle he and all
his people were baptized. They bor|row
their Liturgy from the Greek
Church, which is written in the Scla|vonian
Language, and u&s;ed in their de|votion
with as much knowledge, as the
Latin among&s;t the Papi&s;ts. They fol|low
the Greeks, though lamely, in the
Architecture of their Churches, who&s;e
chief ornaments are Images, adorned
with rich Stones and Pearls, wherein
they admit no Sculpture but only paint|ing;
for they look upon the Romi&s;h
Statue-wor&s;hip as Idolatry. They kneel
not in their devotions, but lie pro&s;trate&punc;
and upon &s;ome great Vigils they &s;tay all
night in their Churches, at certain
times pro&s;trating and cro&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves,
and knocking their heads again&s;t

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Marriages are not very &s;olemn;
a few attend the Bride about three
a clock in the afternoon, and at their
coming out of the Church, the <HI>Panna|ma,</HI>
or Clerk, &s;trews Hops upon the
Bride, and wi&s;hes her children as thick
as Hops; another with a Sheep-skin
coat turn'd outward meets her, and prays
&s;he may have as many children as there
are hairs on his coat.</P>
<P>The Bridegroom is led home by
young Fellows, and the Bride (being
cover'd all over) by an old Woman, and
the Pope marches before with his Cro&s;s.
They &s;it a while down at Table with
Bread and Salt before them, but eat no|thing;
In the mean time a Quire of Boys
and Girls &s;tanding aloft, &s;ing <HI>Epithala|miums,</HI>
or nuptial Songs, &s;o bedawb'd
with &s;cum of bawdry and ob&s;cenity, that
it would make <HI>Aretines</HI> ears glow to
hear them. After this they are conduct|ed
by the Pope and Old-women to a
<PB N="8" REF="17">
Room, where &s;he advi&s;es the Bride to be
debonair and buxom, and exhorts the
Bridegroom to be&s;tow due benevolence,
and here they are &s;hut up for two hours;
the old Woman in the interim attends
for the tokens of Virginity, which ha|ving
gotten, &s;he goes triumphantly, and
demands <HI>Albricias</HI> of the Parents, fir&s;t
tying up the Brides hair which before
hung over her ears. The married cou|ple
mu&s;t have no earth over their
heads (a Ceremony &s;trictly ob&s;erved, as
if mortality then ought not to be the
object of their meditations) for you mu&s;t
know all warm Rooms are covered with
earth half a yard thick to keep in the
heat.</P>
<P>The Bridegroom has a Whip in one
Boot, and a Jewel or &s;ome Money in the
other, he bids the Bride pull them off,
if &s;he happens upon the Jewel, he counts
her lucky, and be&s;tows it upon her; but
if &s;he lights upon the Boot with the
Whip in it, &s;he is reckon'd among&s;t the
unfortunate, and gets a Bride-la&s;h for
her pains, which is but the earne&s;t-penny
of her future entertainment. The
Ru&s;&s;ians di&s;cipline to their Wives is very
<PB N="9" REF="17">
rigid and &s;evere, more inhumane in
times pa&s;t then at pre&s;ent. Yet three
or four years ago a Merchant beat his
Wife as long as he was able, with a
Whip two inches about, and then cau|&s;ed
to put on a Smock dipt in Brandy
three or four times di&s;tilled, which he
&s;et on fire, and &s;o the poor creature pe|ri&s;hed
mi&s;erably in the flames: Cer|tainly
this per&s;on was a Mon&s;ter, not a
Man, born of a Tygre&s;s, not a Woman,
and in no wi&s;e de&s;erved the Epithete
of good or wi&s;e. For the Heathens

<Q><BIBL>Hom. II.</BIBL><L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign">.</L></Q>
<P>And yet what is more &s;trange, none
pro&s;ecuted her death; for in this ca&s;e
they have no penal Law for killing of a
Wife or Slave, if it happen upon cor|rection;
but it is a &s;trange cha&s;ti&s;ement
to kill, &s;eeing the de&s;ign hereof was ne|ver
intended to end people, but to mend
them. Some of the&s;e Barbarians will
tye up their Wives by the hair of the
<PB N="10" REF="18">
head, and whip them &s;tark naked. But
this &s;everity is not commonly u&s;ed, un|le&s;s
it be for Adultery or Drunkenne&s;s:
And I perceive it begins to be left off, or
at lea&s;t the Parents endeavour to pre|vent
it, by their cautious contracting
their Daughters; For in their Joyntures
they oblige their Husbands to find them
with clothes &s;uitable to their quality, to
feed them with good whol&s;om meat and
drink, to u&s;e them kindly without whip|ping,
&s;triking or kicking them, many
more terms and tautologies they u&s;e;
not unlike the Common Laws of <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
Upon Forfeiture they put this in
execution, which is determin'd in one
Court, but not without bribery, as all
other Suites are. I wi&s;h the Engli&s;h
had more of the former (I mean their
expedition) and le&s;s of the latter, <HI>viz.</HI>
their corruption. Seldom a Wedding
pa&s;&s;es without &s;ome Witch-craft (if
people of quality marry) chiefly acted

<P>THeir Burials are &s;trange, as &s;oon as
the breath is out of the body (as

Corps into the Church, where it abides
not long before it be buried in the

hire others to do the like, but little rea|&s;on

<P>Thirty daies after burial, they read

<P>In the <HI>Carnaval</HI> before <HI>Quadrage&s;&s;ima,</HI>

in the la&s;t week they drink as if they
were never to drink more. Some drink
<HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> four times di&s;till'd, until it
fire in their mouths, and kindle a flame
not unlike that of <HI>Bocca di inferno,</HI> which
i&s;&s;ues out at their throat; if they have
not milk given them to drink, they pre|&s;ently
die. Much wi&s;er in my judgment

Snow (a &s;ad cold bed) and there they
are frozen to death. If any of their

<P>THeir Imagery is very pitiful paint|ing,
flat and ugly, after the Greek

they were not proud. When a Picture

chu&s;e out a new one, and depo&s;ite mo|ney
for the exchange (for they mu&s;t not

&s;trive above all things to &s;ave their Ima|ges:
but if they e&s;cape not the Confla|gration
they mu&s;t not be &s;aid to be

&s;taid the fire by that means, held his
<HI>Micola</HI> &s;o long, that he had like to have

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw that I am di&s;cour&s;ing of the
Ru&s;&s;ian Church, it will not be ami&s;s
to relate a &s;ad Tragical &s;tory, which
was acted in the time of our Engli&s;h
Re&s;ident, who it &s;eems had a Monkey
famous among&s;t the Mu&s;covites to this
day, for he would take money in his
mouth, and go into the Market, and
&s;hew it to the Co&s;tard-mongers, who
in kindne&s;s would give him Nuts and
Apples; many &s;uch api&s;h pranks he was
wont to play. But we come now to the
Cata&s;trophe of his mirth. Being not
content to act a merry part in <HI>Foro,</HI> he
begins <HI>lu dere cum Sacris,</HI> and goes into a
<PB N="28" REF="29">
Church hard by the Engli&s;h Hou&s;e,
where he crept in and tumbled down
their Gods. The Prie&s;t amaz'd to &s;ee
what was done, cro&s;&s;es him&s;elf a thou|&s;and
times, and &s;ets their God-&s;hips in
their places again, exorci&s;es the foul
Fiend, taking his Hor&s;e-tail dipt in holy
water, he da&s;hes the doors and win|dows,
that this Devil might not re-enter.
But for all this, one morning early Pug
came in at a window, and began with
St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and the re&s;t of the Gods
and Godde&s;&s;es in order, as they &s;tood in
his way; down he throws <HI>Dagon</HI> and
the wares of <HI>Rimnon</HI> as zealou&s;ly as if
he had been bred up in new <HI>England,</HI> and
ever and anon he grinn'd in the Popes
face, who &s;tanding arm'd with a Cro&s;s
and holy Water, therewith be&s;prinkled
Pug, who (hating it as bad as the Devil,)
fled home.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the Pope goes to the Patri|arch,
and complains mo&s;t bitterly a|gain&s;t
a <HI>Nincheen</HI> (or Stranger) living
in the Engli&s;h hou&s;e, for throwing down
many of their Gods, breaking their
Lamps, pulling off their Jewels and
Chains of Pearl wherewith they were
<PB N="29" REF="29">
adorn'd and la&s;tly for prophaning the
holy place. Hereupon an order was
&s;ent to &s;earch and examine the Emba&s;&s;a|dors
hou&s;e; all his Retinue was brought
forth. No, it was none of them, but
a little <HI>Ninicheen;</HI> &s;o the young chil|dren
were brought out, and by chance
the Monkey came jumping in with the
Children: O that is the <HI>Nincheen,</HI> quoth
the Pope, apprehend him, which was
done accordingly, and the Patriarch
finding out the folly, was a&s;ham'd, and
&s;ent away the Prie&s;t with di&s;grace for a
Fool. But however, poor Pug (to pa|cifie
the angry Gods) was deliver'd over
to the &s;ecular power, who cha&s;ti&s;d him
&s;o &s;everely that he dyed upon it. Now
Chronology would be enquir'd into,
Whether <HI>Ben John&s;ons</HI> Zeal of the Land,
or Countrey man of <HI>Banbury,</HI> who in a
Fanatick fury de&s;troy'd the Ginger-bread-Idols

which he &s;uffer'd per&s;ecution, and was

&s;oft or &s;mooth but their womens
fat &s;ides. But I come to their Mu&s;ick,
lea&s;t I &s;hould tyre you with tuning it.
You mu&s;t know they have Mu&s;ick-Schools,
where Children are brought
up with great diligence, and in much
&s;everity. Their notes are very &s;trange,
borrowed, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the Greeks, or

that they &s;eem frighted into
them, as our Fidlers are when a Con|&s;table
comes in the mid&s;t of a Le&s;&s;on.
Sometimes they will run hard upon a
&s;cent, as though they meant to imitate
the Italian Recitative Mu&s;ick. Finally,
when they have brought up the&s;e chil|dren
to a perfection, what with Ba&s;es,
Tenors, Contratenors, and Trebles, you
&s;hall hear as good a Con&s;ort, as ever
was &s;ung a at <HI>Cats Ve&s;pers.</HI> They have
but little In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick, it being
<PB N="33" REF="31">
prohibited by the Patriarch in oppo&s;iti|on
to the Romi&s;h Church. And it has al|&s;o
been thought State policy to forbid
all Mu&s;ick or Jollity among the Com|mons,
to prevent Effeminacy. They
have Bagpipes, and &s;mall Fiddles with
bellies like Lutes, wherewith they play
four or five notes.</P>
<P>As for their Warlike Mu&s;ick they
have Kettle Drums, who&s;e dull &s;ound

<P>BEfore I leave the Church-men, I
mu&s;t tell you a merry &s;tory of the
Mona&s;tery of <HI>Ro&s;tone,</HI> which &s;tands up|on
a Lake, and not far from this Friar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
there is a Nunnery al&s;o, for commonly
they are near together. In this Lake,
about twenty years &s;ince, a Fi&s;h was
&s;een of &s;uch a magnitude, that they &s;up|po&s;ed
it could not be a Fi&s;h, but rather
&s;ome <HI>&s;pectrum, Leviathan,</HI> or Water-Devil.
It would often appear half a|bove
water, which made an Eagle &s;toop
at it with &s;uch violence, that piercing
his Talons into the Fle&s;h, he could not
pull them out again; but <HI>Leviathan</HI>
plunging to the bottom with his enemy,
carried him into an unknown element,
<PB N="39" REF="34">
and &s;o overcame him, but could not be
&s;o rid of him, for his Talons &s;till &s;tuck
fa&s;t, which made him repair to the
&s;hore, where being &s;een by the Friars
with feathers on his back, he confirm'd
their Fears; and therefore to prevent
further mi&s;chief, they fell a ringing the
Bells, went on proce&s;&s;ion with all the in|&s;truments
and weapons of defence,
wherewith the&s;e Friars-militant wont
to re&s;i&s;t the foul Fiend, but all this did
little avail to profligate the &s;uppo&s;ed
enemy of Mankind. At la&s;t one Mr. <HI>Ro|ger
Eaton</HI> a Merchant coming by, hears
this &s;ad Relation, and being curious to
&s;ee with the re&s;t, who &s;tood upon the
&s;hore, he undertook to encounter the
Mon&s;ter; an attempt no doubt as peri|lous
by Water, as that of St. <HI>Georges</HI> was
by Land; the wor&s;t was, he could not
find a <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> &s;o bold &amp; hardy as to row the
Boat for him, till he had made one cou|ragious
by drinking. In &s;hort, he &s;hots
the Bea&s;t with a &s;crew'd Gun, who be|ing
taken up, proved to be nothing el&s;e
but an over-grown Pike&punc; a yard and an
half long, and as big as a Man. The
Fraternity a&s;ham'd of their Proce&s;&s;ions

made again&s;t a &s;illy Fi&s;h, did neverthe|le&s;s
to gratifie their Champion, make
them&s;elves and him drunk, and &s;o the
Play ended. But a wor&s;e Tragedy was
acted, when they took another Pike not
&s;o large at this, intending to entertain
one Mr. <HI>White</HI> an Engli&s;h Merchant; for
the Cook cutting it open, found a new-born
Infant in its belly, which was &s;u&s;|pected
to be thrown in by one of the

not altogether &s;o &s;uper&s;titious; for

what a &s;inner was I, that I knew not &s;o

<P>Now we are in <HI>Chicha&s;s</HI> Land, it will
not be ami&s;s to tell you what people
they are, <HI>viz.</HI> A kind of Tartars, a rude
&s;warthy look'd people; their Women
are very unhand&s;ome, gro&s;s, and gro&s;ly

be drunk again, and then recover them|&s;elves
by Dancing, which they love &s;o
much, that they count him a mean man
who does not keep a Fidler in his hou&s;e.
Their Government is perfectly Anarchi|cal,
for upon an In&s;urrection they de|&s;troy'd
all their Nobility and Gentry,
and are now govern'd by Collonels of
their own chu&s;ing, with whom the

are much devoted to Witch-craft, and
count it an extraordinary piece of learn|ing

He had a Staff with a very &s;harp

<P>On a Fe&s;tival he play'd certain mad
pranks, which cau&s;ed &s;ome Strangers,
<HI>viz.</HI> Dutch and Engli&s;h Women to
laugh; he taking notice hereof, &s;ent for
them all to his Pallace, and had them
&s;trip't &s;tark naked before him in a great
Room, then he commanded four or five
bu&s;hels of pea&s;e to be thrown down be|fore
them, and made them pick them all
up, when they had done he gave them
&s;ome wine, and bad them take heed how
they laugh'd before an Emperour again.

got together about eighty or ninety, and
&s;ent them up &s;peedily, with an excu&s;e
that he could find no more in his Pro|vince,
and de&s;ir'd pardon. The Emperor
&s;eeing &s;o many Baldpates, wonder'd what
<PB N="49" REF="40">
it meant, and cro&s;&s;'d him&s;elf; at la&s;t
one of the chief delivering the Letter, he
ask'd his <HI>Diack</HI> what he wrote to the
<HI>Vayod,</HI> who &s;hew'd him the copy, by
which he found out the mi&s;take, and &s;o

<HI>Vayod</HI> had taken a Goo&s;e for a

him, till one day pa&s;&s;ing through the
<HI>Po&s;hiarr</HI> (an open place like <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
where execution was u&s;'d to be done) he
commanded the Hangman to cut off his

the Hangman asked him whether Goo&s;e
was good meat.</P>
<P>He courted Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> very
much to marry her, and was a great

which he did, managing him with &s;uch
rigour, that the Hor&s;e grew &s;o tyr'd and
tam'd, that he fell down dead under

pre&s;ent &s;o kindly, that he made all his
Nobility buy <HI>Lopkyes</HI> of the fellow at
five &s;hillings a pair, and he wore one
pair him&s;elf. Thus put the man in &s;tock,
whereby he began to drive a Trade, and
in time grew &s;o con&s;iderable, that he
left a great e&s;tate behnd him. His Fa|mily

<P>The <HI>Czarowidg</HI> (as I &s;aid el&s;ewhere) is
not &s;een of the people till he is about
fifteen years old, nor of many Noble|men;
but then he is expo&s;ed to publick
view, carried upon mens &s;houlders, and
&s;et on high in the Market-place, which
<PB N="57" REF="44">
is to prevent Impo&s;tors, wherewith
this Land has often been deceived.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> marries not out of his own
Dominions, but takes a wife where he
plea&s;es, though &s;eldom out of the Nobi|lity.
When &s;he dyes, all the intere&s;t
of her Kindred and Relations dies with
her. <HI>Eliah</HI> the pre&s;ent Emperours Fa|ther
in law was of &s;o mean account, that
within this twenty years he drew wine
to &s;ome Engli&s;h men, and his daughter
gather'd <HI>Mu&s;hrooms,</HI> and &s;old them in the
Market. The other which he &s;hould
have had was a Captains Daughter.
The Imperial Pallace is built of Stone
and Brick, except &s;ome lodgings where|in
his Maje&s;ty &s;leeps and eats all the win|ter:
For they e&s;teem wooden Rooms
far whol&s;omer than Stone; and they
have &s;ome rea&s;on to think &s;o, becau&s;e
their &s;tone Rooms being arched thick
reverberate a dampne&s;s when the Stove
is hot. The Emperour lodges three &s;to|ry
high. His drink is <HI>Brague</HI> made of
Oates. His bread is made of Rye, which
the Ru&s;&s;ians e&s;teem a &s;tronger nouri&s;h|ment
than Wheat. The <HI>Czar</HI> lyes in no
&s;heets, but in his Shirts and Drawers,
<PB N="58" REF="45">
under a rich &s;able Coverlid, and one
Sheet under him. His Recreations are
hunting and hawking. He keeps above
three hundred Falconers, and has the
be&s;t Ger-Falcons in the World, which
are brought from <HI>Syberia;</HI> he flyes at
Ducks or other Fowl. He hunts the
Bear, Wolf, Tyger, Fox, or rather baits
them at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When&s;oever he goes forth, the Ea&s;t
Gate of the inner Wall of the City is
&s;hut till he returns. He &s;eldom vi&s;its
any Subject, yet the la&s;t year he did,
but went not in the common way, for the
&s;ide of a wall was pull'd down. At the
birth of the <HI>Czaroidg</HI> the Commons for
joy bring him great Pre&s;ents, which he
returns back again, but if he likes any
of them, he gives the full worth. On
the <HI>Saturday</HI> after Good <HI>Friday,</HI> he goes
into &s;ome of the Pri&s;ons, examines the
Pri&s;oners crimes, and delivers many of
them. An Engli&s;h man put in for coyn|ing,
was lately relea&s;'d. They put very

<P>I Cannot at pre&s;ent give you an ac|count
of their Judiciary proceedings,
which are very confu&s;ed, and yet they
have a method, and every Province its
<HI>Precause</HI> or Office, wherein is a <HI>Bayor,</HI>

who hath many Clerks under him: He
repre&s;ents the <HI>Boyar,</HI> who is the Repre|&s;entative
of his Imperial Maje&s;ty. If
there be a Suit in Law, and no bribes on
either &s;ide, mo&s;t commonly the Plain|tiff
gets the better for they pre&s;ume he
has mo&s;t right.</P>
<P>Murther is here to be bought off with
money; If a Man kill his Slave or his
Wife in correcting them, there is no
<PB N="72" REF="53">
law again&s;t them. Or if a man is mur|ther'd,
and no body pro&s;ecured his mur|therer,
the law takes no notice of his
death.</P>
<P>The accu&s;ed cannot be condemn'd
although a thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es come in a|gain&s;t
him, except he confe&s;&s;es the Fact;
and to this end they want not torments
to extort Confe&s;&s;ions; For fir&s;t, they
put them upon the Strappado, if this
does not, they &s;econdly whip them, and
herein their Hangmen are very exqui|&s;ite:
For 'tis &s;aid at &s;ix or &s;even la&s;hes
they are able to kill a man. Sometimes
the con&s;ederate will &s;ee the enemy to
execute &s;uch a piece of his office, to pre|vent
farther mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>They can &s;trike to an hairs breadth,
and with a &s;harp kind of Iron pierce
through the very Ribs; they will &s;lice
down a mans back like a Chine of Pork,
and when that's done, they will &s;alt the
raw place, bind his hands and legs, and
putting a Cowl&s;taff through them, hold
him over the Fire, and Carbonadoe him.
If he per&s;i&s;ts (for may be the party has
nothing to confe&s;s) they let him loo&s;e,
and the Hangman &s;ets his &s;houlders, and
<PB N="73" REF="53">
lets him re&s;t twenty days, till he be al|mo&s;t
well, and then repeats the former
Torments, and perhaps pull out a Rib
or tow with a pair of hot Pincers; If
all this will not do (for &s;ome will out|&s;tand
all the&s;e Tortures) they will then
&s;have the crown of his Head, and drop
cold water upon the bare place, which
&s;ome that have felt, acknowledge to be
the quinte&s;&s;ence of all Torments; for
every drop &s;trikes like a dart to the
very heart. All this is done where the
Hangman is not brib'd, for he will then
cut deep. I have &s;een &s;ome who&s;e backs
have been &s;carifi'd like the bark of a
Tree, which afterwards were healed,
but they could never wear out the &s;cars
and marks thereof.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of Coyners is to
melt &s;ome of the coyn, and pour it
down their throat. <HI>Neque enim lex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u|&s;tior

<PB N="76" REF="55">
is <HI>Ani&s;um Indicum Stellatum,</HI>
the Merchants &s;ay they u&s;e it (as we do
in <HI>England)</HI> with Sugar, and e&s;teem it
a rare Remedy in di&s;ea&s;es of the Lungs,
<HI>flatus Hypochondriaci,</HI> and di&s;tempers of

travel into the&s;e parts are &s;ix years in
their Journey, &s;taying for winter way
in &s;ome places, and &s;ummer in others.
The Metropolis of <HI>Syberia</HI> is <HI>Zambul,</HI>
the Re&s;idence of the chief <HI>Vayod.</HI> They
trade in Furs, and chiefly in Sables,
which, as &s;ome &s;ay, are found in no o|ther
part of the world be&s;ide. They
feed on a Berry or Nut, which here grows
plentifully upon trees, what it is I can|not
learn, but am promi&s;ed &s;ome of
them, with further information. They
hunt &s;ix or &s;even weeks together, and
are drawn by Dogs, whom they feed
with Fi&s;h, wherewith their Lakes and
Rivers abound,: they put forty or fifty
Dogs in a Sledge, and are cloth'd with
treble Furs; they lie out all night in
the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and make fires, with
which they dre&s;s their Fi&s;h. The Dogs
<PB N="77" REF="55">

the Men as dextrous in &s;hooting them in

parts afford no Bread, but Fi&s;h in abun|dance,
which they eat dryed in&s;tead of
bread, and yet they live to a great age.
They feed their Cows with Fi&s;h during
the fro&s;t, which makes the milk ta&s;te
fi&s;hy. The River <HI>Ob</HI> is a va&s;t River,

The North of <HI>Syberia</HI> is call'd <HI>Samo|geda,</HI>

or Men-eaters, for they eat tho&s;e
whom they conquer in battel. Their
food is mo&s;t Fi&s;h, their riches Deer, of
which they have great herds, and &s;o
tame, that at whi&s;tle they will appear at
hand, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be har|ne&s;&s;ed,
and put to the &s;ledges by pairs,
which they will draw &s;wiftly as wind
eighty miles a day. When they hunt
for new Deer, they con&s;ult the Prie&s;t,
who, after many ceremonies and conju|rations,
tells them in what quarter they
mu&s;t go, and mo&s;t commonly they find
his predictions true. There is no di|&s;tinction
in the clothes of Male or Fe|male,
but both are made of Deer
skins, with the hair &s;ide outward, which
by experience they find the warme&s;t.

<P>Their Manners, Language and Religi|on

his light, which they enjoy &s;o little in
the winter. They are exce&s;&s;ively jea|lous
of their Wives, which puts me in
mind of the &s;trength of fancy and cu|&s;tom:
One being ask't if he thought
not an Engli&s;h Woman (then pre&s;ent,
young and hand&s;om) as pretty and fair
as his Lady ugly; an&s;wer'd, no &s;urely,
thy Wives complexion is pale, like the

are e&s;teem'd great Riches, and mu&s;t
not be &s;een by young men, till contract|ed
in Marriage, which they are at &s;ix or
&s;even years old, that they may be &s;ure
to have them Virgins: they buy them of
their Parents for &s;o many head of Deer,
and take them home to their hou&s;es, and
lock them up <HI>al Italiano.</HI> The men like|wi&s;e
&s;erve their wives &s;o, when they go an
hunting, and 'tis as ordinary as &s;trings
to a pur&s;e. For they have a Proverb,
<HI>He that leaves his pur&s;e open invites a
Thief to it;</HI> &s;uch as have &s;een their En|gines,
&s;ay they come not &s;hort of the
Italian ones.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are only round tents
made of Deer-skins and Matts, with a
<PB N="80" REF="57">
fire in the mid&s;t, and a hole at the top
for the &s;moke, about which they lye
round, and find them&s;elves warm e|nough.
In the Summer they remove
near the Rivers to fi&s;h, which they dry,
and pre&s;erve again&s;t Winter, they kill
their fi&s;hes with arrows, and mo&s;t com|monly
eat them raw: they eat young
Puppies, and count them a rare di&s;h.
They are not thought worthy of a Go|vernour
by his Imperial Maje&s;ty, nor
&s;o con&s;iderable as to be taxed, only vo|luntarily
they pay a few Deer. None
under&s;tand their barbarous language
but them&s;elves, nor yet their Laws
which they execute &s;ecretly. When
they &s;ell a Deer to Strangers, they are
&s;ure to indent to have the garbage, which
they eat after a &s;light &s;queezing out of
the excrements. He is be&s;t qualifi'd a|mong&s;t

<P>Their Languages differ not much, ju&s;t
as Engli&s;h and Scotch, the Poli&s;h is
&s;aid to be the more copious and com|plemental,
but to my ears, which judge

Their clothes will not fit us, nor our

dearer than the Dutch, which though
&s;light, and &s;hrinks a &s;ixth part in wet|ting,
yet the Ru&s;&s;ians like it, becau&s;e
they &s;ay none but new cloth will &s;hrink,
but we are too blame for not fitting
them with the like. Again, we keep
our old trade of Cloth, but they bring
Silks, and all manner of pedlary ware,
which vends better than cloth, the
which grows now much out of Fa&s;hion.
<HI>Sed &s;i populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P>If the Per&s;ian and Indian Silk trade

<HI>We have</HI> Abraham <HI>to our Father,</HI> we

<P>THis Copy I received from the hands of
a Gentleman that attended upon
the learned Dr. <HI>C.</HI> all the time of his
being with the Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> It was
then in the form of a Letter written with
the Doctors own hand to an eminent Do|ctor
of Phi&s;ick here in <HI>London.</HI> After|wards
I was advi&s;ed by &s;everal Per&s;ons of
Quality to put it into the hands of &s;ome
that were learned and skilful, to di&s;tribute
it into Chapters and Sections, for the more
ea&s;ie finding out anything contained there|in,
and the better methodizing it, that it
might an&s;wer the Title de&s;igned for it. And
in regard the Author died before it came to
the Pre&s;s, which prevented his looking it o|ver,
or correcting any thing that might be oc|ca&s;ioned
through his hasty writing of it, I was
nece&s;&s;itated to get another worthy per&s;on to
Tran&s;cribe it, who being altogether a &s;tran|ger,
not only to the Doctors &s;tile and way of
writing, but al&s;o to the &s;tile and language
of this Country of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> except by reading.

which is mo&s;t in the proper names of Men
