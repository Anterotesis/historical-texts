<HEAD>To the Right Honourable
ESME STUART,
Earl of March, and Darneley, Lord Leighton &amp;c.
Son and Heir to the Illustrious
JAMES
Duke of Richmond and Lennox.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_COnsulting with my self about a <HI>Patron</HI> for
this <HI>Book,</HI> I concluded to make choice of
such a Person as should be both of most
noble extraction, and of spotless innocency:
So that in this captious Age, none should presume to charge
him with the least offence in <HI>thought, word, or deed.</HI> For
justly fearing too many faults might be found in the book
it self, I desired to make some amends by dedicating it
to One free from all exception.</P>
<P>Your Honour is the first in our Nobility, whom I
finde qualified according to my desire; descended from the
<PB REF="4">
best Houses in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> And
as it happeneth in a <HI>Constellation,</HI> that the <HI>Lustre</HI> there|of,
amounting from many Stars together, darkeneth the <HI>light</HI>
of those particulars, which produced it: So in your <HI>Honours</HI>
Pedegree, the <HI>collective splendour</HI> obscureth the <HI>distinct
brightness</HI> of those <HI>severall families</HI> whence the same re|sulteth.</P>
<P>Now that your Honour cannot be taxed with any actu|all
offence, your tender Moneths not as yet compleating a
Year; do sufficiently evidence. Whose innocence is the most
entire Relique of our Primitive integrity; and most per|fect
pattern of our future felicity. Yea some admiring
what motives to mirth Infants meet with in their silent
and solitary smiles, have resolved (how truely I know not)
that then they converse with <HI>Angels,</HI> as indeed such cannot
amongst mortals finde any fitter Companions.</P>
<P>One, or more of these three main Ends are aimed at by
Authors in all ingenuous dedications; Hope to receive pro|tection;
Desire to derive instruction; and Zeal to express
affection.</P>
<P>For the first, though you cannot by your <HI>Power,</HI> yet you may
by your <HI>Innocence</HI> be an excellent <HI>Patron</HI> to protect our en|suing
Work. In these civill wars, some have saved themselves
from the sword, with no other shield then bearing a <HI>Babe</HI> in
their armes, which rebated their enemies fury into compas|sion.
So, when some shall be ready to wound our Book with
their censuring Darts, they will be mollified into mercy finding
your innocent Name prefixed in the Front thereof.</P>
<P>As for <HI>deriving instruction,</HI> I confess your Honour as yet
incapable thereof. But seeing Infants clothes are providently
<PB REF="4">
made with the biggest, to which they will grow up in process of
time; why may not books (the clothes of the minde) be pro|portioned
above their present capacity, in hope they will seaso|nably
shoot up to the understanding thereof? And untill such
time as your Lordships judgment can reap profit from our <HI>De|scriptions</HI>
herein, may your eyes but take pleasure in the <HI>Maps</HI>
which here are presented unto you.</P>
<P>But the last, not least consideration in my choice of your
Honour, is my ambition to tender my humble service thereun|to;
The rather because ESME<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or <HI>Amedcus</HI> the Topl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ll Saint of <HI>Aul|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">igney.</HI></NOTE> your auspicious Name
promiseth, in my apprehension, some good success, now at the
<HI>third return,</HI> as long since at the <HI>first imposing</HI> thereof on
your <HI>Ancestour.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Esme</HI> Lord Aulbigney (a place of great priviledges in
the Province of <HI>Berry,</HI> first by the King of <HI>France</HI> bestowed
on [and still possessed by] your Family, in reward of their signal
service to that Crown) about two hundred years since proved
the happy reviver of your family almost extinguished for want
of a Heir, and by his virtuous demeanour added much honour
thereunto.</P>
<P>The same Name now returns on your Lordship, who found
your Fathers house in point of posterity in as low a Condition.
Indeed your Grandfather left a numerous off-spring, whom I
may fitly compare to the <HI>many strings</HI> of some <HI>musicall</HI> Instru|ment.
But amongst his male-issue (for the rest I pass by as <HI>si|lent strings,</HI> sending no <HI>sounds</HI> to posterity, but losing their own
<HI>Surnames</HI> in their matches) One was soon <HI>fretted</HI> in pieces with
sickness; Three more, <HI>cut off</HI> in these wars; One absent be|yond
the Seas, and not easily to be <HI>tuned</HI> to a married estate; and
the other <HI>single string</HI> remaining [<HI>His Grace</HI> your Father] left
<PB REF="5">
altogether issueless untill your Lordships welcome Nativity.</P>
<P>But O! what melody can Heavens hand make on a <HI>Mono|chord?</HI>
which since hath sent your Lordship on a good message I
hope, to the <HI>Honest house of</HI> LENNOX.</P>
<P>But I grow tedious in a long Letter to a little Lord, and
therefore turn my Pen into Prayers, that Christ would be plea|sed
to take you <HI>up into his Armes,</HI> (whose embraces are the best
swadling-clothes, as to streighten, so to strengthen you in the
growth of Grace) <HI>to lay</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mark, 10. 16.</NOTE> <HI>his hands upon you and bless you,</HI>

<P>_WHen <HI>Iacob</HI> had served <HI>Laban</HI> full seven years for his daughter
<HI>Rachel,</HI> and now promised himself the possession of what he
had long looked and much laboured for; his hopes were
frustrated by the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 29. 23.</NOTE> substituting of <HI>Leah</HI> in the room of her sister.
And although it may be pleaded that <HI>Leah</HI> was not well qualified
and highly meriting in her self, yet still <HI>Leah</HI> was not <HI>Rachel,</HI>
and <HI>Iacob</HI> remained both deceived and injured thereby.</P>
<P>Many have long patiently waited, that I should now accor|ding
to my promise set forth an <HI>Ecclesiasticall History;</HI> who now may justly com|plain
that their expectation is abused, finding a Changeling in the place thereof, a
Book of a far different Nature tendered in stead thereof. And should I plead with
<HI>Laban</HI> the Custome of the Countrey, that it is not fashionable <HI>to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 19. 26.</NOTE> give the younger
before the first-born;</HI> should I alledge for my self that this Book, containing matter
of more ancient date, ought to precede the other, yet this, like <HI>Labans</HI> answer, will
be taken rather as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">, then solid satisfaction.</P>
<P>But, Reader, let me plead in my just defence, that if you be pleased to peruse my
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">In my Epistle to the Reader before the <HI>Holy State.</HI></NOTE> <HI>promise,</HI> you will finde the same conditionall, and not obligatory, except (besides
other requisites there expressed) Peace be first setled amongst us. And indeed the
subject challengeth the same, seeing <HI>Truth</HI> cannot be matched to <HI>Safety</HI> in such Rela|tions,
till <HI>Peace</HI> shall first contract them.</P>
<P>Now herein I make my severest <HI>Creditour</HI> my sole <HI>Iudge,</HI> appealing to him whe|ther
the Premises be performed. True it is we have no <HI>Wars</HI> at this instant, yet we
have <HI>Rumours of wars;</HI> and though the former onely doth <HI>destroy,</HI> the latter also
doth <HI>distract.</HI> Are these <HI>gloomy dayes already disclouded?</HI>(to use my own expression
in my<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> Promise) or rather is it not true in the Scripture phrase, that the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 12. 2.</NOTE> <HI>clouds return
after rain?</HI> Indeed I am sorry that I can say so much in my own defence, and should
account my self happy, if all other <HI>Breaches</HI> were made up, and I onely to be punished
for my <HI>breach of Promise.</HI> Which, notwithstanding all the difficulties of the subject,
and distractions of our days, I hope in God, in competent time to effect, might but
my endevours meet with a quiet residence, and proportionable incouragement for
such undertakings.</P>
<P>Mean time accept of these my Labours, which by Gods blessing, and the bounty
of my friends are brought into the light: Usefull I hope for the understanding of the
Scriptures. What I have herein performed, I had rather the Reader should tell me
at the end, then I tell him at the beginning of the Book. For the manifold faults
herein, I doubt not but the ingenuous Reader (finding in <HI>Palestine</HI>^e <HI>six Cities of
Refuge,</HI> by Gods own appointment, for the safeguard of such as slew one unawares
without <HI>malice prepense</HI>) will of his bounty build a <HI>seventh</HI> in his own bosome for
my protection, when guilty of unvoluntary mistakes in so great a work. If thou reapest
any profit thereby, give God the glory; To whose providence thou art commit|ted

<HEAD>CHAP. 1. The Designe asserted from causlesse Cavils.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. _BEing now by Gods assistance to undertake the De|scription
of <HI>Iudea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three grand objections a|gainst this sub|ject.</NOTE> my condition appeares not un|like
to the <HI>Israelites</HI> at<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Numb. 13. 23, &amp; 28.</NOTE> <HI>Kadesh-Barnea,</HI> who were
much pleased with the report that the Spies
brought of the fruitfulnesse of the Countrey, un|till
they told them of <HI>Ahiman, Sheshai</HI> and <HI>Talmai,</HI>
the three sonnes of <HI>Anak:</HI> which quite appaled their courage and dead|ed
their desire thereof. In the like manner whilest I am invited with se|verall
pleasing considerations, and delightfull motives, to adventure
on this work, three Giantlike objections, which must be encountred, do
in a manner dishearten me from further proceeding. For some will
lay to my charge, that the description of this Countrey
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Hath formerly been done by many.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Cannot perfectly be done by any.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 If exactly done, is altogether uselesse, and may be somewhat
superstitious.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>&sect; 2. Yet we fear not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No disgrace to adventure on the same work after ma|ny others.</NOTE> by Gods blessing, and the Readers favour, seve|rally
to enter the lists against them all. For the first: Whereas it is ob|jected,
that many formerly have performed the same; this cavill is not
planted particularly against my inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">vours, but is levelled against the
industry of all Posterity, in any future designe.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 1. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>there is no
new thing under the Sunne.</HI> Except therefore men were Gods to create
new subjects to write upon, groundlesse is the first exception against us.
It never disheartened S. <HI>Luke</HI> to write his Gospell, <HI>for as much as many had
taken in hand to set it forth before.</HI> Yea the former endevours of many in
the same matter, argue the merit of the work to be great. For sure
<PB N="2" REF="14">
there is some extraordinary worth in that face, which hath had so ma|ny
Suitors. Wherefore although we cannot with <HI>Columbus,</HI> finde out
another world, and bring the first tydings of an unknown Conti|nent
or Island, by us discovered, yet our labours ought not to be con|demned
as unprofitable, if setting forth an old subject in a new edition
enlarged and amended. This I dare say, though many have written
discourses without Mappes, and more Mappes without discourses, and
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Adricom. <HI>puts</HI> Zabulun Issachar <HI>&amp;</HI> Manasses <HI>in one Mappe,</HI> Ephraim, Dan <HI>&amp;</HI> Benjamin <HI>in another.</HI></NOTE> some both, (yet so that three tribes are joined in one Mappe) none have
formerly in any tongue (much lesse in English) presented us with di|stinct
Mappes and descriptions together.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. But in the second place it is objected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Object.</NOTE> that certainty in this sub|ject
is unattainable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certainty here|in not to be ob|tained.</NOTE> so that the most studious therein, after they have
travelled the whole day, through many tedious difficultie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, must bee
fain to take their hard lodging at night on a bare uncertainty. The
bowels of the best Mappes are puffed up with the humours of fancy,
and a scepticall windinesse, so that a conjecturall Earthquake shakes the
foundations of the strongest mountains, in the point of their exact si|tuation.
Such are the irreconcileable differences betwixt Geographers
in their descriptions.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. For answer:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Answ.</NOTE>
I could wish that this objection also, lay onely a|gainst
the work in hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This should not quench but quicken our in+dustry.</NOTE> and might not [almost] equally be enforced
against other liberall undertakings: for he that holds a reed in one hand
to mete the Topography, and an houre-glasse in the other to measure
the Chronology of the Scripture, shall meet with as many, if not more
uncertainties, in the latter as the former. And yet the learned pains
of such-as labour therein, justly merit commendation. If all conjectu|rall
results should be cast out for weeds, few hearbs would be left in
the Gardens of most Arts and Sciences. Saint <HI>Paul</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 9.</NOTE> hath a passage, <HI>We
know in part, and prophecy in part;</HI> which is a good curb for our curiosity:
And the same Apostle hath a precept,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 5. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Prove all things, hold fast that which
is good;</HI> which is as good a spurre for our diligence. As for the differen|ces
betwixt Geographers, they ought not to make us carelesse to follow
any, but carefull to choose the best; except with the fluggards drowzie
fancy, we tune the Alarums to our industry, to be Lullabies to our
lazinesse.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. In the last place it is objected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Object.</NOTE> that the designe, if exactly finished,
amounts but to a difficult trifle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is a difficult trifle.</NOTE> hard to doe, uselesse when done. And
who will pity the aking of his teeth, who hath wilfully hurt them,
with cracking that shell, wherein he knew was no kernell? It
matters not to any mans salvation, to know the accurate distance be|twixt
<HI>Iericho</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> and he that hath climbed to the top of mount
<HI>Libanus,</HI> is not in respect of his soul, a haires breadth nearer to heaven.
Besides, some conceive they heare <HI>Palestine</HI> saying unto them, as <HI>Samuel</HI>
to <HI>Saul</HI> endevouring to raise him from his grave,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 28. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Why hast thou disquieted
<PB N="3" REF="14">
me to bring me up?</HI> Describing this Countrey is but disturbing it, it being
better to let it sleep quietly, intombed in its owne ashes. The rather,
because the<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Revel. 21. 10.</NOTE> <HI>New Ierusalem</HI> is now daily expected to come down, and
these corporall (not to say carnall) studies of this terrestriall <HI>Canaan,</HI> be|gin
to grow out of fashion, with the more knowing sort of Christians.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. It is answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Answ.</NOTE> though these studies are not essentiall to sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ation,
yet they are ornamentall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is ornamen|tall to divinity.</NOTE> to accomplish men with knowledge, contri|buting
much to the true understanding of the History of the Bible. Re|markable
is that passage of the Apostle, <HI>Acts 17. 26. And hath made of
one bloud all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath de|termined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation:</HI> wherein
we may see Divinity the Queen waited on by three of her principall
Ladies of honour, namely, skill in
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Genealogies, concerning the persons of men and their Pede|grees,
<HI>of one bloud all nations.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Chronology, in the exact computation <HI>of the times afore appointed.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Geography, measuring out the limits of severall nations, <HI>and
the bounds of their habitations.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Our work in hand is a parcell of Geography touching a particular
description of <HI>Iudea;</HI> without some competent skill wherein, as the blind
<HI>Syrians</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 King. 6. 19.</NOTE> intending to goe to <HI>Dothan,</HI> went to <HI>Samaria;</HI> so ignorant per|sons
discoursing of the Scripture, must needs make many absurd, and
dangerous mistakes. Nor can knowledge herein, be more speedily and
truly attained, then by particular description of the tribes, where the
eye will learn more in an hour from a Mappe, then the eare can learn
in a day from discourse.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. But this last objection being forked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No danger of superstition in this subject.</NOTE> hath the sharper point there|of
still behinde, challenging this our subject to be guilty of superstition.
A sinne always detestable to God, but now adayes grown odious to
man. And well it were if the edge of their Zeal were equally whetted
against Profanenesse. Sure if this our work were faulty in this kind, I
my self would send it the same way with the <HI>Ephesian<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Acts 19. 19.</NOTE> conjuring bookes.</HI>
Not all the water of <HI>Kishon,</HI> of <HI>Iordan,</HI> of the <HI>Red,</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> of the <HI>Middle-Land
Sea,</HI> described in these Maps, should serve to quench the fire,
but all should be burnt to ashes. But no such haste I hope, to condemn
this innocent book, wherein studiously we have abstained from all
such pictures as come within the bounds of danger, yea borders of
offence, and have onely made choice of those, which the most precise
approve usefull for the illustration of Scripture.</P>

where the treasures concealed, are by Poets consigned to <HI>Pluto</HI>
King of hell: and modern authors avouch, that malignant
Spirits haunt the places, where these metals are found. As if the
Devill did there sit abrood to hatch them, cunningly pretending
an unwillingnesse to part with them; whereas indeed he gains
more by one mine minted out into money, then by a thousand
concealed in the earth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Because it stands not with the State of a Prince to be his own

before their second character of this Countrey, when infected with po|pular

of the Scripture. In severall ages the land fell under different divisions.</P>

<ITEM><PB N="17" REF="21">

<ITEM>3 By <HI>Ioshua</HI> it was parcelled into twelve portions, betwixt so ma|ny

<ITEM>4 In <HI>Rehoboams</HI> reigne it was rent into two kingdomes, <HI>Iudah</HI> and
<HI>Israel.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5 After the Captivity it was divided into three Provinces, <HI>Iudea,
Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Galile.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6 In Christs and his Apostles time it was carved into four Tetrar|chies,
and some other appendent dominions.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>We will first survey it in the originall condition thereof, as it con|sisted
of a Heptarchy, or seven ruling nations of <HI>Canaan,</HI> whose number,
names, extraction, and severall habitations require much care and dili|gence
to rank and order them aright.</P>
<P>The first difficulty we meet with, is in the number of these nations, so
variously reckoned up. They are counted up thus: two, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 7.
three, <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 28. five, <HI>Exod.</HI> 13. 5. sixe, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3. 8. 17. seven, <HI>Iosh.</HI> 3. 10.
ten, <HI>Gen.</HI> 15. 19. eleven, <HI>Gen.</HI> 10. 15. &amp; 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 1. 13. and seventeen,
if a collective number of them all be cast up. Now how come they to
be so differently computed where one and the same Spirit is the Auditour
to state their account? It is answered, that seven was the compleat and
solemne number, whereon God himself emphatically insists when re|peating
his favours to the <HI>Iews,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Deut. 7. 1.</NOTE> Seven nations greater and mighter then thou.</HI>
And perchance the beast in the Revelation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Revel. 13. 1.</NOTE> <HI>with seven heads,</HI> beareth
some allusion thereunto. Wherefore when these seven nations are
summed up defectively, under that number, we must conceive such of
them as are omitted to be implyed under the <HI>Genericall name</HI> of <HI>Cana|anites.</HI>
But on the other side, when above seven are brought, then the
inhabitants of the larger <HI>Canaan,</HI> are cast into the account: whose coun|trey
was promised too, but never peaceably possessed by the <HI>Israelites,</HI> as
we observed before. We finde three severall Editions (as I may call
them) of the nations of <HI>Canaan,</HI> whereof the most authentick and
common is <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 1. which we will principally peruse, as followeth.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="nation">
<HEAD>1 Hittites.</HEAD>
<P>These come forth first as if it were to usher and make room for the
rest; as well they may, being Giants of such strength and stature, the
<HI>Anakims</HI> being descended from them: so formidable to their foes, that
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Sam. Bochar|tus Geog&punc; sacra. lib. 4. cap. 35.</NOTE> some conceive them named from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>hittah,</HI> which signifies <HI>to scare</HI>

<P>It will be objected, that though age and accidents may alter the old,
and induce new lineaments in mens faces, yet the Simile holds not
in the description of Countreys, where the same chanels of sea, cour|ses
of rivers, falls of vales, flats of plains, ridges of hills, must re|main.
As for mountains, time, for want of carriage, must be forced

water-marks, must always continue, without any considerable altera|tion.
But it is answered, that even these seeming Standards of nature,
are moveable with time and casualty, inundations, tempests, and earth|quakes;
in the last (being the earths violent cough) sometimes she spits up
her own lungs, casting up great hills where never were any before. What

<HEAD>CHAP. 9. The third division of the land into twelve Tribes, some of all which Tribes re|mained
untill, at, and after the time of our Saviour.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. THe third solemn division of <HI>Palestine,</HI> was made by <HI>Ioshua</HI> in|to
twelve Tribes, of whose severall bounds largely in our en|suing
discourse. This partition remained untill <HI>Shalmaneser</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 6.</NOTE> carried ten
Tribes away captive, and in exchange, brought in his own colonies to
possess their conquered Countrey. However, although the main body
of the ten Tribes were thus transplanted, without any hope to return to
their native soil, yet some competent representation of every Tribe, re|mained
behind in their own countrey, even untill, at, and after the time
of Christ, and his Apostles.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Alledge not to the contrary, that it is said, after <HI>Shalmaneser</HI>'s car|rying
them away captive,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 18.</NOTE> <HI>there was none left but the Tribe of Iudah onely.</HI>
Understand it, that <HI>Iudah</HI> onely remained in the flourishing condition
of a kingdome. That onely was the visible standing-corn, amongst
which, others of <HI>Israel,</HI> like loose eares were scattered. But to the point,
that some gleanings of these ten Tribes, remained in their countrey, af|ter
the Assyrian captivity, may be proved;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 From the very nature of a generall calamity, which lighting on
a populous nation, cannot so particularly apply it self to every
individuall person, but that some will escape. The<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Isai. 7. 20.</NOTE> <HI>hired rasor</HI>
made not such clean work, as to shave every hair, but that some
small down might creep under the edge thereof. That<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Isai. 14. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Besome
of destruction</HI> swept not so clean, but that some dust may be
presumed left behind in the small crevices of the countrey.
Some (no doubt) by timely flight, casuall absence, especiall fa|vour,
secret concealment, might escape; and others, through
age and sickness unable to travell, might be permitted to re|main
behind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Mention is made of a<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 30. 6.</NOTE> <HI>remnant which escaped out of the hands of the King
of Assyria.</HI> And when <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iezekiah</HI> kept his solemn passover, he sent<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 30. 10. 18.</NOTE>
messengers to <HI>Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, Zebulun, Asher,</HI> some of
whom made a mock at his courtesie, and others thankfully em|braced
his gracious invitation.</ITEM>

<P>&sect; 3. Such remnants of the ten Tribes, being afterwards carried cap|tive
with <HI>Iudah</HI> to <HI>Babylon,</HI> returned thence with the rest of their bre|thren;
as probably is insinuated,

to cast up the particular sums, of the severall families of <HI>Iudah</HI>
and <HI>Benjamin</HI> set down there, will find them fall short twelve
thousand of the foresaid number. Where therefore shall we sup|ply
the account? Hear how the great Jewish-Chronicle (set
forth not long after our Saviours time) resolves this question;

of Ephraim and Manasseh.</HI></ITEM>

<P>Nor is the testimony of <HI>Iosephus</HI> to be slighted herein, though <HI>Ios.</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">In Animad ver. in Euseb. numero. 1734.</NOTE> <HI>Scaliger</HI> causlesly condemns it, affirming that the King of <HI>Egypt</HI> em|ployed
seventy two <HI>Iews</HI> to translate the Bible into Greek, taking six out
of every Tribe, which compleat that number.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. That such fragments of the ten Tribes returning from <HI>Babylon,</HI> were
reestated in their ancient possessions, I dare not affirm, but rather be|lieve
the contrary. For there was no inducting them into their former
inheritances, because no vacancy or avoidance therein; <HI>terra plena,</HI> the
land was still full with the plantation of <HI>Medes</HI> and others brought in by
<HI>Shalmaneser.</HI> So that this remnant of the ten Tribes, were (for the main)
fain promiscuously to make their habitations where they might, whilst
<HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> were restored to their ancient, intire, and distinct
possessions. Yet there is some probability, that some of <HI>Zebulun</HI> and
<HI>Nephthali</HI> in our Saviours time had recovered part of their ancient patri|mony.
Otherwise the force of <HI>Isaiahs</HI> prophecy, and <HI>Matthews</HI> applica|tion
is much impaired:<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 14. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>The land of Zebulun and the land of Nephthali &amp;c.
The people that sate in darkness saw great light.</HI> That is in a genuine and un|strained
sense, their posterity had the day of deliverance first dawning
unto them, whose ancestors were first overtaken with the night of af|fliction.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. That in the time of Christ, and his Apostles, some pious people
of all Tribes, were extant in <HI>Iudea,</HI> plainly appears,

<P>&sect; 2. The kingdome of <HI>Iudah</HI> consisted chiefly of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI>
which alone was so powerfull, and populous, that the men thereof, in
the muster made by King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 24. 9.</NOTE> <HI>David,</HI> amounted in number to moe, then
the half of all the other Tribes there expressed. Besides the body of this

the Tribe of Iudah.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dan,</HI> part of whose possession was taken out of what ori|ginally
was assigned to <HI>Iudah.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These must be presumed, to beare a State-sympathy to the kingdome
of <HI>Iudah,</HI> ingaged thereunto by the position of their countrey. Yea, we
finde it expressed in Scripture, that<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 King. 19. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Beersheba</HI> a City of <HI>Simeon;</HI> and<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 11. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Gath,</HI>
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 11. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Zorah,</HI> and<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Ajalon,</HI> Cities of <HI>Dan,</HI> did belong to, and were fortified by
the Kings of <HI>Iudah.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Besides these, two thirds of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> pertained to
the same kingdome; as also all the <HI>Levites</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 11. 14</NOTE> which <HI>left</HI> their Cities in
<HI>Israel,</HI> and clave to the house of <HI>David.</HI> These, though properly the eyes
of the land, had hands also, and contributed to the strength of the king|dome.
Adde hereunto all the well-affected, which out of all the Tribes
<PB N="32" REF="29">
of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 11. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Israel</HI> resorted to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> For, the by-ditches of <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI>
did not so drain the peoples devotion, but that much thereof ran in the
right chanel to the Temple; and no doubt, many violently kept at home,
had their hearts at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and their bodies in <HI>Israel,</HI> to which king|dome
all the rest of the Tribes did belong.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Here it will be richly worth our pains, to enter on a compara|tive
estimate of these two Kingdomes, which of them exceeded in puis|sance:
Herein we shall carry an impartiall hand; and indeed, though
the controversie be betwixt two Kings, there is nothing to be got by
flattering of either.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. We will compare them first in that, wherein <HI>Solomon</HI> placeth
the honour of a King,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Prov. 13. 28.</NOTE> <HI>the multitude of their subjects.</HI> And here any clear
judgment will find for the Kings of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 6. Secondly, if the extent of their dominions be surveyed, and our
eye in the Map made umpirer therein, the case is clear in view without
measuring, that <HI>Israel</HI> was the greatest.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Thirdly, if their Cities be numbred, the result will be this, <HI>Iudah</HI>
had the Sun, <HI>Ierusalem; Israel</HI> had the Moon, <HI>Samaria,</HI> and most Starres
of the first magnitude, <HI>Ieri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ho, Iezreel, Mahanaim &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 8. Fourthly, if their ports, and naval power be considered, neither
will be found very active that way, contentedly yeelding their sea-tra|ding
to the <HI>Phenicians.</HI> Yet <HI>Israel</HI> had the advantage of havens, and marine
accommodations, bordering most on the Mediterranean; <HI>Iudah</HI> also (to
hold the scales even) had <HI>Ezion-Gaber,</HI> a considerable port on the Red-sea,
as may appear by <HI>Ahaziahs</HI> request to <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 King. 22. 49.</NOTE> <HI>Let my servants goe with
thy servants in the ships;</HI> plainly importing, that the men of <HI>Iudah</HI> were the
Cape-merchants and prime mariners in those seas, by whose courtesie
the subjects of the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> were admitted to trafique there. How|ever,
<HI>Ezion-Gaber</HI> on the Red-sea was but a key to the back-door (little
of the East-Indies being then known, and less traded to) whereas the
havens on the Midland-sea opened the broad gates of commerce to the
most and best frequented parts of the world.</P>
<P>&sect; 9. Fifthly, if the absoluteness of their Kings power be stated in
their respective dominions, here in the opinions of some the upper hand
must be adjudged to <HI>Iudah.</HI> The Kings whereof in administration of
justice (or rather revenge) often exercised arbitrary power, making
use of their prerogative above law. As appears by <HI>Solomons</HI> proceedings
against the lives of <HI>Shimei, Ioab,</HI> and <HI>Adoniah;</HI> and more plainly in <HI>Ieho|ram's</HI>
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 King. 21. 13.</NOTE> executing his own brethren, by his peremptory pleasure, with|out
legall conviction of them. Whereas no monument is extant, of
such arbitrary proceedings in the kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> more confining them|selves
to legall courses. Yea, the very murder of <HI>Naboth</HI> carried the face
of a judiciall process, wherein legall ^n formalities of witnesses, though
suborned, were observed in a solemn Session. The reason why the Kings
<PB N="33" REF="29">
of <HI>Iudah</HI> were more unlimited in their power, was, say they, because
they derived their title immediately from the God of heaven, confir|med
in <HI>Davids</HI> familie by severall descents. But the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> be|ing
Creatures of their own subjects, made by popular election, on con|dition
to remit their taxes and burdens, (and seldome above three of the
same stock in a direct succession) were fain to ingratiate themselves,
with remitting much of that royall rigour used by the Kings of <HI>Iudah.</HI>
And this is assigned by a judicious<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> Hist. World 1 part. 2600. cap. 19.
Sect. 6.</NOTE> Author as a principall cause why
<HI>Israel</HI> never returned to their former subjection to <HI>Davids</HI> family, because
the scepter of <HI>Iudah</HI> was too heavy for them, and they lived under more
liberty in their own kingdome.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. Sixtly, if their forain impressions, made by them on neigh|bouring
Princes be considered, the balance is so even, it is hard to say,
on which side the beam breaketh. For, as memorable were the victo|ries
of the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> against the <HI>Syrians,</HI> so no lesse fortunate the
fights of some Kings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Asa, 2 Chron. 14. 13. &amp; Ichosaphat, 2 Chron. 20. 23</NOTE> of <HI>Iudah</HI> against the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> and other enemies.
And as the kingdome of <HI>Moab,</HI> till the death of <HI>Ahab,</HI> was<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 King. 3. 5.</NOTE> tributary to
<HI>Israel:</HI> so <HI>Edom,</HI> untill the end of the reign<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 21. 8.</NOTE> of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> was in subjecti|on
to the crown of <HI>Iudah.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 11. Seventhly, if their home-achievements each against other, be
recounted, (the truest touch-stone of their severall strengths) God often
made them alternately hold up one another, whilst he whipt them both
for their sinnes. But although <HI>Abijah</HI> once got a remarkable<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 13. 19.</NOTE> conquest
of <HI>Ieroboam,</HI> yet generally <HI>Israel</HI> worsted <HI>Iudah,</HI> overpowering them with
multitude of men. Thus <HI>Baasha</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 16. 1.</NOTE> cooped up <HI>Asa</HI> in his own land; <HI>Ioash</HI>
<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 25. 23.</NOTE> overcame <HI>Amaziah,</HI> and took <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> and <HI>Pekah</HI> almost utterly<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">2 Chr 28. 6.</NOTE> con|sumed
<HI>Ahaz,</HI> and his kingdome.</P>
<P>&sect; 12. To conclude, if their lasting and continuance be measured,
herein <HI>Iudah</HI> clearly carrieth away the preheminence. Grant, <HI>Israel</HI> beat
<HI>Iudah</HI> at hand, yet <HI>Iudah</HI> beat <HI>Israel</HI> at length, even out of distance. For,
whilst the <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity did onely snuffe <HI>Iudah,</HI> for seventy years,
(blazing the brighter when they returned from banishment) the <HI>Assy|rian</HI>
conquest utterly extinguished <HI>Israel,</HI> from ever appearing again, in a
formed Common-wealth, in their own Countrey.</P>

These Tetrarchies in <HI>Iudea,</HI> took their originall from the Testament of
<HI>Herod</HI> the great, who leaving severall Sons, bequeathed unto them par|cells
of his Kingdome.</P>

was of <HI>Galilee,</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Luke 23. 7.</NOTE> sent him to <HI>Herod,</HI> to be tried before him: either out of
civility, because he would not incroach on anothers jurisdiction; or
out of policy, to decline so distastfull, and dangerous employment; at

<P>&sect; 3. Concerning the bounds of <HI>Iudea</HI> and <HI>Galilee (Samaria</HI> being so
swallowed up betwixt them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why <HI>Abilene</HI> mentioned by Saint <HI>Luke.</HI></NOTE> that the southern part thereof belonged to

more fully in the Description of <HI>Nephthali.</HI> As for <HI>Abilene,</HI> we are

less solicitous in assigning the accurate bounds thereof, because it lay
wholly out of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the proper subject of our discourse.
<HI>Abilene,</HI> called by <HI>Ptolemy Abilene Lysaniae,</HI> being a fair City in <HI>Coelosyria,</HI>
where the dominions thereof ranged far on the north of <HI>Libanus.</HI> If any
demand, why the Tetrarchy of <HI>Abilene</HI> is mentioned by Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> see|ing
it was an exotick, and forain territory, out of the pale of <HI>Palestine;</HI> let
them know, it was done out of the over aboundant exactness of the
Evangelist, for these reasons:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 The more exquisitely to notifie the particular time of his histo|ry,
not onely by the date of the Governours of <HI>Iudea,</HI> but also of
contemporary neighbouring Princes. And the harmony in
chronology is the sweeter, the more are brought into the consort.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Because many dispersed <HI>Iews,</HI> equally concerned in Christ, and
the benefit of the Gospell, lived scattered in <HI>Abilene.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Because having formerly mentioned three Tetrarchs, the num|ber
had not been perfect, and entire, without adding the fourth.
Thus some English coines being quarter-pieces, cannot be put
away in payment without loss, except four of them be joined
together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Because, though <HI>Abilene</HI> was not within the compass of the lesser
<HI>Canaan,</HI> possessed by the <HI>Iews;</HI> yet it was within the bounds of
the larger <HI>Canaan,</HI> that Countrey once belonging to the <HI>Archites,</HI>

<P>&sect; 4. Now whosoever shall with a Compasse in his hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inequality of these Te|trarchies in ex|tent and reve|nue.</NOTE> survey the
extent of these Tetrarchies, will finde them to fall out very uneven in
their dimensions, some much larger then others. Indeed they were
measured with no other scale, then the favour and friendship of the
Emperour, so that the best befriended at <HI>Rome,</HI> got most dominion in
<HI>Palestine.</HI> Yet were these Tetrarchies as justly divided, as our English
Hundreds, (and those perchance equall in their primitive institution,
for number of men) seeing we count threescore and eight hundreds in
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">See <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">peeds</HI> Maps.</NOTE> <HI>Kent,</HI> and but six in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> accounted little less in the compass there|of.

yeelded four hundred talents yearly to the Governour.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Indeed exactness in observing the bounds of these Tetrarchies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word Te|trarchies vari|ously taken.</NOTE>
is not to be expected; which, in process of time, passed under all parts

but perchance anciently, the foresaid <HI>paces, bow-shoots,</HI> and <HI>days-journeys</HI>
were reduced to a certain proportion, though now to us unknown.
And yet hence no imperfection in Scripture-History is justly inferred,
because the point is of no such concernment, and the holy Spirit inten|ded
not exactness therein, as not important to the truth of the story.</P>

was extraordinary, that in the greater scorn and derision, that the gal|lows

<HEAD>CHAP. 14. Directions for the use of the Scale of miles in our Maps.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. WIthout a <HI>Scale of miles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The vast diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|rence between miles of seve|rall countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ys.</NOTE> (or degrees equivalent) the livelyest
draught of a Countrey is no regulated Map, but a paper
full of names of places. However, vast is the difference betwixt the miles
in severall Countreys. An <HI>Italian</HI> mile containeth seven, an <HI>English</HI>
eight furlongs. A <HI>French</HI> is equall to two, a <HI>vulgar Dutch</HI> to three <HI>English</HI>
miles, the <HI>large Dutch</HI> to four, the miles in <HI>Swizerland</HI> to five, not to say six
of our <HI>English</HI> computation: so that, in that mountainous countrey, tra|vellers
have a double disheartning, the worst of ways, and longest of
miles. Yea upon the Alpes in the juncture of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in the
self same mountain, on the north side the miles are the longest, on the
south side the shortest in Christendome.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Come over into <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And betwixt miles of the same countrey.</NOTE> and what difference is there betwixt a
<HI>Middlesex</HI> and a <HI>Yorkshire</HI> mile? The former the shortest, because (as some
will have it) every London-Lady when weary with walking, concludes
the space though never so short to be a mile: whilest the well moun|ted
<HI>Rank-riders</HI> in the northern countrey, insensible of the length of the
way, because of the swiftness of their horses, make miles of the largest
proportion. Our scale of miles presented in all these Maps, is according
to the <HI>English</HI> mile containing eight furlongs; to which we have redu|ced
(a task rather troublesome then difficult) the measures of other
authours, giving allowance according to the standards of the severall
countreys whereof they were.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. Here (if my complaint might finde any pity, and that pity give me
any ease) I would complain of the irreconcileable difference betwixt Au|thors
(proceeding on one and the same scale of miles) in making their
distances betwixt their severall places. We read of <HI>Saul</HI> that he so scatte|red
the army of the <HI>Ammonites</HI> so that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 11. 11.</NOTE> <HI>two of them were not lest together&punc;</HI>
Such a dispersion we finde in the judgment of learned men, not two of
them generally concurring in the measuring of miles betwixt eminent
places.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Now as Jurie-men, when severall witnesses swear point-blank
one against another, make bold to beleeve his testimony who appears
most credible unto them, such power we have assumed to our selves in
these differences, to follow those, who we conceive have the best autho|rity.
Herein having a speciall regard to those that lived upon the place,
and preferring their judgments above others, though otherwise of grea|ter
learning, because in <HI>matters of fact</HI> done in his presence, the eyes of a
child are to be beleeved before the eares of a man.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Where both authours appear of equall authority in themselves,
and number of followers, we have umpired the difference by pitching
<PB N="46" REF="36">
on a middle number betwixt both. For instance,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Patest. Seig. f. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Seiglerus</HI> makes it
fourteen thousand paces or fourteen miles betwixt <HI>Zidon</HI> and <HI>Tyre</HI> (emi|nent
Marts, and therefore the distance betwixt them might be notorious|ly
known) whilst<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Vadian. Phax. f. 271.</NOTE> <HI>Vadianus</HI> makes it two hundred furlongs, or twenty
miles. Here to part the difference equall, we have insisted on 17 miles.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. However when this, and much more caution is used by us,
our Scale of miles is so farre from pretending to the exactness of
those left-handed <HI>Gibeonites<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Jud. 20. 16.</NOTE> to hit the mark at an haires-breadth and not misse,</HI>
that a large and charitable latitude must still be allowed us in a subject so
hard and full of uncertainty. Yea the holy Spirit it self speaks not po|sitively
of distances of places, but with words of qualification.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Luke 24. 13.</NOTE> <HI>About
threescore furlongs from Ierusalem to Emmaus;<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">John 6. 19.</NOTE> About five and twenty or thirty fur|longs
they had rowed on the Sea;</HI> as if five in thirty made no considerable
difference. If the same favour may be but allowed our scale of miles,
I doubt not but it will acquit it self against all just exception.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Now for the further managing of our <HI>Scale of miles</HI> we request
the Reader not to extend it, therewith to measure all the properties, or
History-pictures in our Map (for then some men would appear Giants,
yea monsters, many miles long) expecting him rather to carry a scale in
his own eyes, for surveying such portraitures. Yea in generall I undertake
nothing in defence or excuse of those pictures, to be done according to
the rule of Art, as none of my work, ornamentall, not essentiall to the
Maps: onely this I will say, that eminency in English Gravers, is not to
be expected till their Art be more countenanced and encouraged. Nor
would I have the Scale applied to Cities drawn in Prospective, as to
<HI>Rabbah</HI> in the Tribe of <HI>Gad</HI> &amp;c. which then will fall out bigger then in|deed
they were; desiring the Reader onely to understand them to be
fair and populous Cities, and therefore made more large and conspicu|ous
then the rest.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. Such Towns as stand (as one may say) on tiptoes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Townes on the upstroke how to be ac|counted.</NOTE> on the ve|ry
<HI>umstroke,</HI> or on any part of the utmost line of any Map (unresolved in
a manner to stay out or come in) are not to be presum'd placed accor|ding
to exactness, but onely signifie them there, or thereabouts. Nor is
this without precedents in the best Geographers, so in their maps to make
the generall continuation of neighbouring countreys clearer thereby.</P>
<P>&sect; 9. If any difference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Maps most to be cre|dited in mat|ters of diffe|rence.</NOTE> on accurate comparing, arise in the distances be|twixt
the same places presented in severall Maps, (some such will escape in
defiance of all diligence) we hope the same will appear inconsiderable, &amp;
such moats (not being before the sight, but in the corner of the eye) will lit|tle,
if at all, hinder the light of a Geographical truth. Surely as in the strictest
laws of Horse-racers, some <HI>wast of weight</HI> is allowed to the Riders: so me
thinks some favour ought to be afforded an Author, in measuring and
making many Maps, were it but for the shaking of his weary hand in
so tedious a work. But if such differences appear somewhat great, let
<PB N="47" REF="36">
those be relied on as the truest, where such places are set down <HI>dat&acirc;
oper&acirc;, of set purpose;</HI> so that it is <HI>the very work</HI> of that Map to describe them:
let those I say be credited before the distances in other Maps, where such
places come in onely of <HI>complement,</HI> or are brought in by the by, to fashi|on
and fill up the (otherwise empty) borders thereof.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AMongst many other meditations, my
serious thoughts have made en|quiry,
concerning <HI>Government</HI> and
<HI>Nobility,</HI> whence each of them de|rived
their originall.</P>
<P>For the first, I finde it as ancient
as <HI>Man,</HI> and extracted from <HI>God</HI>
himself. Who because he was a <HI>Spirit,</HI> (and therefore invi|sible)
the better to try what Tribute of obedience, Men out of
<HI>Conscience</HI> would pay unto him, stamped a <HI>character of do|minion,</HI>
<PB REF="38">
as his own visible Image (in the infancy of man|kind)
on the <HI>Father of the family,</HI> that so honour and duty
might be given to <HI>God</HI> in yeelding subjection to him who
represented him. These first <HI>Governours</HI> were termed <HI>Patri|arches,</HI>
that is, <HI>Father-Princes,</HI> their compounded name,
speaking their mixt authority. And<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ant. Iud. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Josephus</HI> writing of the
death of <HI>Methuselah,</HI> saith <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>He left,</HI> or
<HI>passed over his principality to</HI> Lamech <HI>his son;</HI> and this
<HI>Prince-ship</HI> continued in the <HI>Primogeniture</HI> for many Ages,
till the method thereof was discomposed, partly by the nume|rosity
of mankinde, partly by their far dispersed habitations.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Government</HI> the <HI>Mistresse,</HI> first born in the
world, whilest <HI>Nobility</HI> her <HI>Maide</HI> came in not long after to
attend her. For such <HI>Persons,</HI> whose vertuous dispositions
commended them to the speciall favour of <HI>Princes in Power,</HI>
had in reward of their worth; <HI>markes of Honour</HI> fixed upon
them: which afterward by succession descended unto their
posterity.</P>
<P>Of these, some imitating their <HI>Ancestours</HI> goodness, conti|nued
in the splendor of their <HI>Nobility,</HI> whilest others degene|rating
by their vicious courses, invited neglect and contempt
upon themselves. Insomuch that in some the <HI>valour</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of
their <HI>Progenitors</HI> (which advanced them by the <HI>sword</HI> in time
of <HI>war</HI>) evaporated all into empty aire; turning into a <HI>wild</HI> and
<HI>riotous animosity;</HI> And in others, the gravity and wisdome
of their Grandfathers (which promoted them by the <HI>Gown</HI>
in the days of <HI>Peace</HI>) settleth into feculent earth, leaving no|thing
but a <HI>tame and unactive stupidity</HI> behinde it.</P>
<P>Herethe <HI>Nobility</HI> of such had expired, save that some of them
seasonably perceiving the desperate <HI>Consumption</HI> thereof
<PB N="50" REF="38">
did follow the prescription of <HI>Physick,</HI> and returned into the
<HI>Native aire</HI> which first gave Honour her birth and being;
and did so repair their lost reputation by practising the Primi|tive
vertues of <HI>Piety, Courtesie, Hospitality; Valour,
Wisdome,</HI> and <HI>Learning;</HI> thus going home to the <HI>Climate</HI>
wherein Nobility was first conceived.</P>
<P>But thanks be to God, your Lordship is none of those
personally guilty of any decay of dignity; whose vertues pre|serve
your Honour in the perfect health and strength thereof,
which hath been the main motive to make me so desirous to
present my book to your Honour, as a proper Patron, even to the
height, for all purposes and intents. Whose Iudgment can ex|amine
the whole, Clemency Pardon what is amiss, and Great|ness
Protect the rest in defiance of opposition.</P>
<P>Indeed Sir, besides desire to shelter my self under your Pa|tronage,
gratitude obligeth me to tender my service to your
Honour. For all my Books, being my <HI>nether and upper
milstone,</HI> (and such by the Leviticall Law, might not be
<HI>taken to pledge,</HI> because a <HI>Mans<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Deut 24. 5.</NOTE> life</HI>) without which I had
been rendered unable to <HI>grinde any Grist</HI> for the good of my
self or others, had been taken from me in these civill wars, had
not a Letter from your <HI>Lady-mother</HI> preserved the greatest
part thereof. Good reason therefore that the first handfull of
my <HI>finest meale</HI> should be presented in thankfulness to your
family.</P>
<P>And now my Lord, bethinking my self of a blessing for your
self and worthy Lady, that she-pattern of Meekness, Modesty
Piety, and Patience; no fitter can be found then what the

there being a <HI>marriage</HI> in the Prayer, wherein <HI>Long-life</HI>

<HEAD>THE TRIBE OF REVBEN. The second Book.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. <HI>REuben</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Iacob</HI> by <HI>Leah,</HI> forfeited his
Birthright by<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 35. 22.</NOTE> defiling his Fathers bed. For which
fact he was cursed,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 4.</NOTE> that <HI>he should not excell.</HI> Where|upon
came such a dearth of eminent Persons
of this Tribe, that neither King, Judge, Priest,
nor Prophet descended thereof. Yea, few men of
fame, onely two notoriously infamous,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Numb. 16. 1. &amp; 26. 5, 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> Generalls of
the mutineers against <HI>Moses:</HI> haply in hope, because of their extraction,
to recover the lost Birthright unto their Tribe. Yet these <HI>Reubenites,</HI> though
not springing high, spread broad; little puissant, very populous, coun|ting
no fewer then forty six<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Numb. 1. 21.</NOTE> thousand five hundred at the generall
muster in mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> all which dying in the wilderness for their infi|delity,
their children descended<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Numb. 26. 7.</NOTE> from them, being forty three thousand,
seven hundred and thirty, possessed this land, east of <HI>Iordan.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 2. A land, that five times exchanged her owners in the old Testa|ment.
First, her originall inhabitants were the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Deut. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Emims,</HI> a younger house
of the <HI>Anakims:</HI> accounted Giants, being great in stature and many in
number. Secondly, <HI>Moabites,</HI> who, though less and lower, yet advanta|ged
by divine<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Deut. 2. 9.</NOTE> assistance, did overtop and overcome these voluminous
<HI>Emims,</HI> and possessed themselves of their land. Thirdly, <HI>Amorites,</HI> under
<HI>Sihon</HI> their King who (somewhat before <HI>Moses</HI> conducted the <HI>Israelites</HI>
hither) acquired the soveraignty of this countrey,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Numb. 21. 26.</NOTE> beating out the
<HI>Moabites,</HI> and banishing them south of <HI>Arnon.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Reubenites:</HI> on
whom <HI>Moses</HI> bestowed it, after <HI>Sihon</HI> was conquered and killed. Fifthly,
<HI>Moabites</HI> again. For it seems after the captivity of the <HI>Reubenites</HI> by <HI>Tilgath
Pilneser 1 Chron.</HI> 5. 26. they made a re-entry on their old possessions:
seeing those cities (formerly inhabited by the <HI>Reubenites</HI>) are propheci|ed
against by<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Isa. 15. &amp; 16. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a. ler. 4. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> under the notion of places belonging
to the people of <HI>Moab,</HI> to be destroied by <HI>Shalmaneser,</HI> and <HI>Nabuchad|nezzar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="42">
&sect; 3. This Countrey had <HI>Iordan</HI> on the west, (dividing it from <HI>Ephra|im</HI>
and <HI>Benjamin</HI>) the River <HI>Arnon</HI> on the east and south (parting it from
the kingdome of <HI>Moab</HI>) and on the north confined on the Tribe of <HI>Gad.</HI>
The extent thereof from east to west may be allowed forty two miles,
not exceeding thirty five from north to south. A Countrey excellent
for grazing, not as if defective in corn and wine, wherein it shared with
the rest of the Tribes, (besides the benefits of some Mineralls, and me|dicinall
waters, whereof in due place) but because exceeding in con|veniencies
for Cattell:<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Numb. 32.1.</NOTE> Pastures to feed, Woods to shade, and Rivers to
wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. Therefore was it bestowed upon the Tribes of <HI>Reuben,
Gad,</HI> and <HI>half Manasseh,</HI> which much abounded in cattell. In which three
we may observe some shadowes of Primogeniture, (which might im|bolden
them to petition to be first served) <HI>Reuben</HI> the eldest of <HI>Iacob</HI> by
his wife; <HI>Gad</HI> eldest by <HI>Zilpah</HI> his concubine, and <HI>Manasseh</HI> first born
of <HI>Ioseph.</HI> But these Tribes as first planted were first plucked up. God car|ved
unto them the first cut of the Land, and after called for the <HI>Voider</HI> to
take it first from them. For they falling from the house of <HI>David,</HI> and
following <HI>Ieroboam</HI> through rebellion to Idolatry, and not being warned
with the terrible blow<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">2 King. 10. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Hazael</HI> gave them, shroudly shrubbing their
branches, God rent them up by the roots in the days of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 King. 15. 29.</NOTE> <HI>Pekah,</HI> by the

generall captivity of their brethren, at the end of the reign of <HI>Hosheah,
2 Kings 17. 6.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4 Leaving the people, come we to survey the places, and memo|rable
actions in this Tribe. In the north<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">east corner thereof, near the
banks of <HI>Arnon,</HI> we finde the tract or territory of <HI>Aroer.</HI> For though <HI>Aroer</HI>
the City was undoubtedly entire in the Tribe of <HI>Gad;</HI> yet it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 5. 8.</NOTE> plainly
appears, that at least a <HI>Moity</HI> of the countrey adjacent (so called from the
city) was possessed by the <HI>Reubenites.</HI> A populous place it was, the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Isa. 17. 2.</NOTE> Pro|phet
mentioning the cities of <HI>Aroer,</HI> though their names or number is
not expressed. Probably <HI>Arnon</HI> one of the principall, <HI>Tell yee it in Arnon</HI>
(<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Icr. 48. 20.</NOTE> says <HI>Ieremy:</HI>) surely not to the fishes in the River, but to a City seated
on the brink thereof, and thence denominated: as <HI>Hull</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> so
commonly called from the Rivolet running by it.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Going south-west, having the stream of <HI>Arnon</HI> for our guide, we
leave <HI>Kedemoth,</HI> not far from the north bank thereof. The <HI>Septuagin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> read
<HI>Kedson</HI> for <HI>Kedemoth,</HI> and the Vulgar, without any warrant, read <HI>Iethson</HI>
for <HI>Kedson:</HI> so procreative is one errour of another. This <HI>Kedemoth</HI> was
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Josh. 21 30. 37.</NOTE> one of the four Peculiars of the <HI>Levites,</HI> wherein they were accommoda|ted
with Safety, Pleasure, and Profit. Safety, in the City it self, within
whose walls they dwelt in secure habitations: Pleasure in their suburbs,
<HI>reaching a</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Numb. 35. 4.</NOTE> <HI>thousand Cubits</HI> from the wall round about, (little less then an
English mile) where they had houses of retirement, with stalls and
stables for their cattell: Profit in their glebe land, extending two thou|sand
<PB N="57" REF="42">
Cubits from their suburbs on every side, improved for pasture,
tillage and vineyards. For thus the survey of the <HI>Levites</HI> lands, <HI>Numb.</HI> 35.
4, 5. (though the difficult place is capable of severall senses) is ex|pounded
by learned <HI>Rabbi Maimonie,</HI> and we in our Maps have described
them accordingly. Now though herein we have given the <HI>Levites</HI> lands
the largest and most favourable bounds (seeing I am unable to endow
them, they shall lose nothing by my restrictive measuring thereof) yet
know that narrower limits are assigned them by <HI>Tremellius,</HI> as shall
hereafter be presented in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In our an|swers to the objections on Reuben.</NOTE> Diagram we have prepared for that pur|pose.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Behold here <HI>Levi's</HI> curse turned into a blessing,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49 7.</NOTE> <HI>Divide them in
Iacob, and scatter them in Israel.</HI> Now the <HI>dividing</HI> of them proved the <HI>dispo|sing</HI>
of them, for their own and others advantage. Their <HI>scattering</HI> was
their <HI>ranking</HI> for the best behoof of the people, for whose instruction
they were intended. They were the <HI>Salt of the earth,</HI> and therefore God
sprinkled them here and there, the more conveniently to season the
whole nation. Insomuch that some English Parishes are more remote
from their Mother-church, then most places in <HI>Canaan</HI> were distant
from the Cities of the <HI>Levites.</HI> We must not forget that in <HI>Ieroboams</HI> aposta|sie,
the religious <HI>Levites</HI> forsook their Cities and<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 11. 14.</NOTE> fled to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> pre|ferring
voluntary exile before wealthy homes, on the condition of an
Idolatrous compliance. It appears not in Scripture, how these Cities
and lands thus left were disposed of. Whether <HI>Ieroboam</HI> himself seised
on them, converting them into demeans of his Crown, or whether he
suffered them to revert to those respective Tribes, from whom they were
taken: so fastning his subjects affections unto him with nailes of gold of
their own profit. Either course may be conceived a cause to hasten the
captivity of the people; it being just that those, who swallow Gods
morsels, should be spewed out of their own possessions.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Round about this City, is the wilderness of <HI>Kedemoth,</HI> not
wholly abandoned to solitariness, but as the rest of this kinde, more
thinly inhabited. It abounded with wild beasts, Lions, Bears, Bores,
Wolves, Foxes, where the pleasure in hunting the game, did not recom|pense
the pains and dangers of the shepheards lying constant Perdues
in defence of their flocks. From this wilderness, <HI>Moses</HI> sent messengers
to<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Deut. 2. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Sihon</HI> King of the <HI>Amorites,</HI> for peaceable passage through his coun|trey.
But <HI>Sihon</HI> (path-wise and land-foolish) by denying a civility,
drew destruction on himself and subjects. For seeking in fight to tra|verse
it, for their <HI>pedibus ambulando,</HI> he was by a <HI>firme Ejection</HI> outed of his
whole kingdome.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. To return to <HI>Arnon.</HI> Hereabouts the children of <HI>Israel</HI> passed o|ver
it, miraculously <HI>with dry feet,</HI> saith<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Adri. in theat. ter. sanct. fol. 51.</NOTE> <HI>Adricomius.</HI> But the miracle seems
rather of his, then Gods making, the Scripture being silent therein,
and the river not of that depth or breadth, but that it was fordable, espe|cially
<PB N="58" REF="43">
with the help of Camels, Mules, and Asses. Many miles hence
this river solitarily runs on as sensible of its sad fate suddenly to fall into
the <HI>dead-Sea,</HI> at <HI>Ashdoth-pisgah.</HI> Where all his comfort is, to have the com|pany

it, not to seem wholly ignorant thereof; and but mention it, not to seem
over credulous therein. Hereabouts is plenty of Alum and Brimstone, the

rained on <HI>Sodome,</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> leaving some tincture in the adjacent

Naturalists discuss the cause, whence this inundation of <HI>Iordan</HI> pro|ceeds;
whether from the violence of winds, then blowing on its stream,

Tribes with the rest; severed by water, the same in worship; on the
other side <HI>Iordan</HI> in position, on the same side with the other Tribes in
Religion. But though there was a noon-day of Innocence in their inten|tions,
yet because (though not a night of guiltiness) a twilight of su|spicion
obscured their actions, it occasioned jealousies in their brethren,
as if they had hatched some idolatrous designe. But when the matter
came to be disputed in a military way, the controversie was ended by
the right stating of the question, and a seasonable distinction well ap|plied,
that it was an Altar onely of memoriall, and<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 22. 23&punc; 24.</NOTE> not for any burnt
meat or Peace-offering. O that all differences between brethren might

preferred such musick, before the clashing of swords, and sounding of

<PB N="61" REF="44">
after his conquest of <HI>Absalom.</HI> We are now arrived at that memorable place,
where God magnified <HI>Ioshua,</HI> heartened his own people, and shrivelled
up the hearts of their enemies, by drying up the waters of <HI>Iordan,</HI> whilest
the <HI>Israelites</HI> passed over in this admirable Equipage.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 The <HI>Priests</HI> went into the river bearing the Ark; in homage
whereunto <HI>Iordan</HI> reverently retreated; (very farre from the
<HI>river Adam,</HI> which is besides <HI>Zaretan</HI>) and they stood on firm
ground in the<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Josh. 3. 17.</NOTE> midst thereof, till all the <HI>Israelites</HI> were passed
over.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Reuben, Gad,</HI> and <HI>half Manasseh</HI> led the <HI>Van,</HI> about<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Josh. 4. 13.</NOTE> forty thousand
men of Armes, the residue of them (in all about<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Num. 26. 10. 18. 34.</NOTE> an hundred thousand) remaining at home to husband their ground, guard
their houses, govern their families.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 After them the other Tribes followed: and it is observed <HI>that
they<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 4. 10.</NOTE> hasted,</HI> not with a distrustfull haste (as suspicious that the
returning waters might drown the hindmost of them) but an
industrious speed, and mannerly quickness, as not willing to
make God wait upon them in continuing a Miracle longer then
necessity did require.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 When all were over, the <HI>Priests</HI> with the <HI>Ark,</HI> who first entred,
last left the water, (all dangerous designes are begun and finished
by Gods assistance) and then <HI>Iordan,</HI> whose streams hitherto
suspended, returned into his channell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 A duplicate or double monument was erected to perpetuate the
memory hereof, being a <HI>Grand Iury</HI> of great stones. Of these,
twelve were solemnely set up on the land in the Tribe of <HI>Ben|jamin</HI>
at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> and the other twelve (the counterpart of this
deed) were left in the midst of the river.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Some perchance may admire that <HI>Ioshua</HI> should set this latter invisible
monument, in a place where it is drowned both in water and obscurity.
But this <HI>River-mark</HI> was such, as possibly the tops of the stones might
appear at low water; or if wholly hidden, and dangerous for boats to
approach, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ailers constant care to avoid them in their passage, called
the occasion of placing them there to their daily remembrance.</P>
<P>&sect; 16. We must not dissemble the difference betwixt Authors, about
the situation of the aforesaid City of <HI>Adam,</HI> but once mentioned in Scri|pture,
and therefore (as the Hebrews have a Proverb of words but once
named, <HI>that they have no kindred and alliance</HI>) more difficult to know the
true posture thereof. The best is, this <HI>Adam,</HI> though having no kindred
hath some company to notifie it; <HI>Adam besides Zaretan:</HI> and one <HI>Zaretan</HI>
is sufficiently known to have been in the half Tribe of <HI>Manasseh</HI> west of
<HI>Iordan,</HI> not far from the sea of <HI>Galilee.</HI> Hence learned<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">In Iosh. pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">6.</NOTE> <HI>Masius</HI> concludes,
that the waters of <HI>Iordan</HI> were cut off, full seventy miles together, north
of the peoples passage over it. To which opinion, under favour, we
<PB N="62" REF="45">
can in no wise consent. Conceiving rather that just against <HI>Iericho,</HI> the
river was dried up, for whereas the station of <HI>Iordan</HI> was most wonder|full,
the <HI>Israelites</HI> had lost all the sight of this wonder on their right side,
if done out of distance so many miles from their view. Place we there|fore
on these reasons (and the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Adric. de Ter. sanct. pa. 129.</NOTE> example of others) both <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Za|retan</HI>
in the Tribe of <HI>Reuben.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 17. Some difference also there is betwixt Divines concerning the
latitude of their passage over the river: Some conceiving it onely to a|mount
to the proportion of a fair alley, lane, or path of such receit alone
as admitted the <HI>Israelites</HI> in a full and free march a competent number a
brest, and that the waters, as in the <HI>Red sea,</HI> standing still on both sides,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Exod. 14. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>were a wall to them on the right hand and on the left,</HI> as the Graver in our Map
hath designed it. Others doe not onely make a gap, through <HI>Iordan,</HI> but
pluck down the whole hedge thereof, maintaining that all the water of
that river on the left hand, (betwixt their passage over, and the <HI>Dead sea)
failed and were cut off, or dried up.</HI> Which latter opinion is most agreeable
to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Josh. 3. 16.</NOTE> Scripture, and reason: for seeing the stream of <HI>Iordan</HI> south of their
going over, was not supplied with any reciprocall or refluous tide out
of the <HI>Dead sea,</HI> the stopping of the waters above must necessarily com|mand
their defection beneath, and that the channell by consequence
for the time being was dried up.</P>

<P>&sect; 19. Let us now take an account of the inland Parts of this Tribe,
and return to the place where the <HI>Israelites</HI> passed over <HI>Arnon.</HI> Betwixt
<HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Arnon</HI> they had forty severall stations, and then entred into the
<HI>Promised land.</HI> In comemoration whereof, probably God did order,
that an offender should receive but <HI>forty stripes</HI> (what Judge soever
counts them too few, would think thirty too many, if he felt them him|self)
and then be freed from further punishment. Coming into <HI>Ca|naan,</HI>
their one and forty <HI>and first fixing there</HI> was at the foot of mount
<HI>Abarim,</HI> and edge of the wilderness of <HI>Ked<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">moth.</HI> Hence they removed to
<HI>Abelshittim,</HI> where <HI>Deuteronomie</HI> was made, the second Edition of the
Law revised, and enlarged by God, the Author thereof. Here the peo|ple
of <HI>Israel</HI> were numbred the second time. And although some parti|cular
Tribes were encreased, amongst whom those three that pitched
on the east side of the Tabernacle, <HI>Iudah, Issachar,</HI> and <HI>Zebulun,</HI> (God and
the rising Sun make any thing fruitfull) yet in the whole, they were

bringing them to untimely ends; whereas all those in <HI>Egypt,</HI>

</LIST></P>
<P>But the most memorable Accident in this place, was the Idolatry of
the <HI>Israelites</HI> to <HI>Baal-peor</HI> an <HI>Idoll,</HI> conceived by most learned men to be
<HI>Priapus.</HI> And who could worship him with piety, whom none with
modesty can describe? It seems that <HI>Moab</HI> and <HI>Midian</HI> (perceiving <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hon</HI>
King of the <HI>Amorites</HI> overthrown in battell) counterfeited amity with
them, and pretending to shew them (being strangers) the courtesie of
the countrey, made them an entertainment, which could not be court|like
and compleat without the company of their women. The <HI>Israelites</HI>
beholding the <HI>Midianitish</HI> women, first liking their faces, then tasting
their feasts, stepped from their <HI>Boards</HI> to their <HI>Beds,</HI> thence to their Altars,
adding spirituall to corporall fornication. This was done by the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Numb. 31. 16.</NOTE> ad|vice
of <HI>Balaam,</HI> whose counsell did more hurt then his curse. All his
charmes could have done them no harm, had he not raised these female
spirits to improve them, which cost the lives of twenty four thousand
<HI>Israelites,</HI> dying of the Plague; till the Javelin of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Num. 25. 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Phinehas</HI> executing of
judgment, stopped Gods fiery sword amongst them.</P>
<P>&sect; 20. Let us now request the Reader, to climbe up the hills of <HI>Aba|rim,
Nebo,</HI> and <HI>Pisgah.</HI> These are a ledge of mountains rising by degrees
from east to west. So that some have compared <HI>Abarim</HI> to the Chancell,
<HI>Nebo</HI> to the Church, and <HI>Pisgah</HI> to the steeple. In mount <HI>Nebo</HI> the Authour
of the<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">2 Macc. 2. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Maccabees,</HI> speaks of a Cave, wherein <HI>Ieremy laid the Tabernacle,
and the Arke, and the Altar of Incense, and so stopped the door.</HI> But the same
Authour in the conclusion of his book confesseth, that his work is like
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ac. 15. 40.</NOTE> <HI>wine tempered with water:</HI> and we take this story to be no genuine juice
of the grape, and value it accordingly. On <HI>Pisgah, Moses</HI> surveyed the
whole land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and although he was advantaged by the height of
the place, and clearness of his eyes (no whit abated in their sight at an
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Deut. 34. 7.</NOTE> hundred and twenty years of age) yet much of miracle must needs be ad|mitted,
in so plain and far discovery. Here <HI>Moses</HI> was buried, being pri|viledged
above other servants of God (whose souls Angels convey to
heaven) that an Angel was his Sexton, to cover his body in earth. Here
he concealed <HI>Moses</HI> his grave, lest the <HI>Israelites</HI> should goe a whoring af|ter
it. Destroying Idolatry is a pious, but preventing it a more provi|dent
Act, crushing it in the occasions thereof. Let none condemn this
for a needless caution, as if no fear that they who sometimes would
<PB N="64" REF="46">
stone <HI>Moses</HI> while living, should adore him when dead. For the crooked
nature of the <HI>Iews</HI> was bowed to <HI>Extremes,</HI> and had no mean betwixt
<HI>hating,</HI> and <HI>adoring.</HI> Besides, when the memories of eminent men, hated
or envied when living, have passed the purgation of death, it is usuall
for their former enemies to fall in love with them.</P>
<P>&sect; 21. May the reader now conceive himself standing on the top of
mount <HI>Pisgah.</HI> Where (though content with a narrower compass, then
what <HI>Moses</HI> discerned) he descrieth a fair Prospect round about him.
Not to repeat the places of the west, because mentioned before, looking
south ward behold the City of <HI>Nebo,</HI> at the foot of its namesake moun|tain:

Cities of <HI>Nebo,</HI> and <HI>Baalmeon</HI> (because their old names taken from false
Gods resented of Idolatry.) But so hard it is to unhabit mens mouths
from old ill customes, that it seems their ancient names still prevailed
in common discourse.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Voss. de origi. &amp; progres. Idol. lib. 2. pa. 346.</NOTE> Criticks start many controversies concerning

eminent for greatness above the rest, or else that all her vines grew so
close and uniform, that they resembled one entire and continued tree:
The<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Isa. 16. 8, 9. &amp; Ier. 48. 32.</NOTE> Prophets always addressing themselves unto it in the singular

<P>&sect; 26. Our work is ended, when we have viewed the north part of this
Tribe, where it confineth on <HI>Gad.</HI> Where we onely meet with one place
of note <HI>Heshbon,</HI> anciently the royall Palace of <HI>Sihon</HI> King of the <HI>Amorites,</HI> &amp;

in<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Num. 32. 37.</NOTE> <HI>Reuben,</HI> and sometimes in<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 21. 39.</NOTE> <HI>Gad.</HI> To accommodate this difference
without making of two Cities of the same name (such multiplication
unwarrantable, save where absolute necessity enforceth it) I finde no fitter
expedient, then by setting <HI>Heshbon</HI> so equally between these two Tribes, as
partially in both, and totally in neither. Thus <HI>Bristoll</HI> is situated betwixt
<HI>Glocester</HI> and <HI>Somerset shires;</HI> and yet challengeth to be an absolute Liberty
of it self; as this <HI>Heshbon</HI> also was an entire demeans of the <HI>Levites.</HI>
One fair gate it had, called <HI>Beth Rabbim gate,</HI> nigh to which were
most clear and pleasant fishponds, to which the<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cant. 7. 4.</NOTE> eyes of the <HI>Spouse</HI> are

like <HI>Leah,</HI> (the resemblance being recounted amongst her perfections,

placed them accordingly, yet so that the Reader (without a miraculous
Faith) may remove these mountains to some other place, when he
finds just cause for the same. At which time also, when proceeding
on more infallible principles for their situation, let him take down

<HI>Amorites</HI> on the sinister front of this our description, because they were
the old inhabitants of this Countrey: our constant custome through this

For as water cannot hold it self, but as it is held in a vessell, so <HI>Reuben</HI>
could not contain himself within the bounds of chastity, till shame and
sorrow did reclaim him. Besides, as water once shed, is never to be
gathered up again; so <HI>Reuben</HI> could never after recollect his lost credit,
to recover the full favour of his Father. Though once he endevoured
to gather up some spilt drops of his reputation by projecting the de|liverance
of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Gen. 37. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Ioseph</HI> from his brethren: but his design miscarried.</P>
<P>&sect; 30. For mine own part, I cannot concur with the common opi|nion,
that these three <HI>Bars wave&egrave;</HI> were the Armes of <HI>Reuben;</HI> princi|pally
because Armes are honorary ensignes, assign'd, or assum'd for
the greater grace of the bearer&punc; Improbable therefore, that this Tribe to per|petuate
the infamy of their ancestour would always have water running
in their shield, as if <HI>Reubens</HI> crime were the <HI>Reubenites</HI> credit; like such
whom the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Philip. 3. 19.</NOTE> Apostle reproves, <HI>that glory in their shame.</HI> Rather let us
hearken to <HI>Aben Ezra,</HI> who allots to the banner of <HI>Reuben</HI> a man or
male child (others a mandrake, others put mandrakes in his hand) re|lating
to <HI>Leahs</HI> words at his birth, calling him <HI>Reuben,</HI> that is,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 29. 32.</NOTE> <HI>See a Son,</HI>

<P>&sect; 31. The proper place for the standard of this Tribe was to be the<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Num. 2. 10.</NOTE> first
of the three Tribes which pitched on the south of the Tabernacle. Thus
though <HI>Reuben</HI> lost the Primacy of power over all, he still kept the pre|cedency
of place before one quarter of his brethren. Whence parents
may be taught, that though on just ground they disinherit, yet not so
wholly to dishearten their eldest sons, but still suffer some re|membrances
of a birthright ever to remain unto them.</P>

of forty thousand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Num. 26. 18.</NOTE> and five hundred entred the <HI>Land of Canaan.</HI>
This Tribe affordeth very martiall men. For such of them as repaired

Gilead</HI> a City<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Josh. 20. 8.</NOTE> in this Tribe. It seems that as the English-law makes a
charitable provision for children left by their parents, that the Parish
wherein they are first taken up, must maintain them: so Genealogists,
the better to methodize the pedegrees of the <HI>Iews</HI> in Scripture, reduce
Persons of unknown Parentage, to those respective Tribes, in whose
grounds they first light on the mention of them. But let <HI>Iehu</HI> pass for a
<HI>Gadite:</HI> the rather because so puisant a Prince, will prove a credit, rather
then a charge to that Tribe to which he is related.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. The land of this Tribe was of a double nature. For what lay
north of the river <HI>Iabbok</HI> was anciently the possession of <HI>Og King of Basan.</HI>
But what lay south of the river, had its property more intricate and in|cumbred
with often exchange of her owners, and on the right under|standing
thereof depends no less, then the asserting of the innocence of
the <HI>Israelites,</HI> the confuting of the cavill of the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> and the re|conciling
of a seeming contradiction in Scripture; Take it thus briefly.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="74" REF="50">
<ITEM>1^t. It was the Land of certain Giants called<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Deut. 2. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Zamzummims.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2^l^y. It was possessed by the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Seriously per|use Iosh. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">3. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Ammonites,</HI> who destroied those Giants,
and this Countrey was accounted a moity or one half of their

<ITEM>3^l^y. It was subdued by<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Compare Num. 21. 26. with Iudg. 11. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Sihon King of the Amorites,</HI> who cast out the
<HI>Ammonites</HI> (when also he destroied the <HI>Moabites</HI>) such as were
south of <HI>Iabbok,</HI> and dwelt in their stead.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lastly, after the overthrow of <HI>Sihon, Moses</HI> gave it to the Tribe of
<HI>Gad,</HI> for their inheritance. Thus God by ringing the Changes
of successive Lords in this Land made musick to his own glory.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Behold we here what the Psalmist<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Psal. 80. 9.</NOTE> saith, <HI>Thou hast brought a Vine out of
Egypt, thou preparest room before it;</HI> the method and manner of which pre|paration
is most remarkable. First, God in his providence foresaw
that the Countrey of the <HI>Canaanites</HI> was without other addition too nar|row,
to receive the numerous people of <HI>Israel.</HI> Secondly, God in his
goodness resolved out of love to righteous <HI>Lot,</HI> that his posterity should
not totally lose their possession, nor would he suffer the <HI>Israelites</HI> their
kinsmen to deprive them of any parcell thereof; giving them a flat
command to the contrary.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Deut. 2. 9. 19.</NOTE> Lastly, God in his justice permitted <HI>Sihon
King of the Amorites</HI> should win part of the Countrey from <HI>Moab</HI> and
<HI>Ammon;</HI> and suddenly sends the <HI>Israelites</HI> to conquer the conquerour;
and now lawfully to inherit, what the other had wrongfully taken a|way:
And thus <HI>he prepared room for his Vine.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. By this time we plainly perceive, that in the <HI>Ammonites</HI> demand
to <HI>Iephtha,</HI> there was some truth blinded with more falshood, that the
countenance of the former might pass the latter unsuspected.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 11. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Israel took
away</HI> (saith the King) <HI>my Land when they came out of Egypt from Arnon even
unto Iabbok, and unto Iordan; now therefore restore these Lands again peaceably.</HI>
True it was, that this Land was once theirs (and so it is plainly called
<HI>Ioshua</HI> 13. 25.) but most false, that ever the <HI>Israelites</HI> took Inch of ground
from them, save onely mediately and at the second hand, taking it
from <HI>Sihon,</HI> who took it from the <HI>Ammonites.</HI> We report the rest to <HI>Ieph|tha's</HI>
answer (who first with a fair ambassie, and then with a famous
victory confuted the <HI>Ammonites</HI> antiquated title to this territory) plea|ding
that the <HI>Israelites</HI> had three<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 11. 26.</NOTE> hundred years peaceably possessed the
same. Now, if upon a strict account, some years fall short of that sum,
the matter is not much, because souldiers love to fill their mouths with
a round number, and too hundred fifty and odde with a good sword
may well be counted three hundred years currant, though not com|pleate.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. The Tribe of <HI>Gad</HI> had the kingdome of <HI>Ammon</HI> on the east, the
half Tribe of <HI>Manasseh</HI> on the north, <HI>Reuben</HI> on the south, and the river
<HI>Iordan</HI> on the west. The length thereof from <HI>Aroer</HI> to <HI>Iordan</HI> may be
computed thirty five miles: and the breadth thereof from <HI>Mahanaim</HI> to
<PB N="75" REF="50">
<HI>Dibon,</HI> falls out a little less. A Tribe inferiour to none for fair rivers, fruit|full
Pastures, shady woods: superiour to most for populous Cities, and
memorable actions atchieved therein. As for <HI>Balme</HI> or <HI>Balsame,</HI> it was
a peculiar commodity of this Countrey. Thus the Prophet betwixt
grief, anger, and pity demands, <HI>Is<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ier. 8. 22.</NOTE> there no balme in Gilead?</HI> and again, <HI>Goe
up into Gilead, and take<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ier. 46. 11.</NOTE> balm O virgin.</HI> In describing this Countrey we
will follow the streams of <HI>Arnon, Iabbok,</HI> and <HI>Iordan,</HI> which (with some
little help lent us besides) will afford us the conveniency to behold all
remarkable mounts in this Countrey.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. In the eastern part of this Tribe the rivers of <HI>Arnon</HI> and <HI>Iabbok</HI>
(though running contrary ways) arise not far asunder: according to
the exact observation of<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus,</HI> who saith that the land of <HI>Sihon King
of the Amorites, lay in nature and fashion like an Island,</HI> betwixt the three rivers
of <HI>Iordan, Arnon,</HI> and <HI>Iabbok,</HI> so near are the fountains of the latter to|gether.
The heads of their springs are found in a mountainous and rocky
soil, affording great plenty of <HI>Iackalls;</HI> mungrell creatures of equivo|call
extraction, deriving cruelty from the Wolves their sires and craft
from the Foxes their dams. These <HI>Iackalls</HI> are meant by our translatours
<HI>Psalm 63. 10. Let them fall by the edge of the sword, that they may be a portion
for Foxes:</HI> not for ordinary Foxes, which indeed are so dainty mouthed,
that they will not feed on any carkasse, but what they kill themselves:
but for these <HI>Iackalls</HI> (which may pass for Foxes, because so by the surer
side) so ravenous, that they will not onely feed on carion above ground,
but even dig holes into the earth, fetch forth, and feed on dead bodies of
men, if not deeply interred.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. The river <HI>Arnon</HI> running full south passeth by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Num. 32. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Aroer,</HI> a fair City
whereof frequent mention in Scripture, but in no other notion, but
onely as the eastern boundary of <HI>Canaan.</HI> Here <HI>Arnon</HI> entertaineth a
river from the west, called the river of<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 24. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Gad,</HI> because rising, running, and
falling within the compass of this Tribe.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. This river of <HI>Gad</HI> had formerly received into it another stream
called the waters of <HI>Nimrim,</HI> threatned by the<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Isa. 156. Ier. 48. 34.</NOTE> Prophets to be dried up: on
the banks whereof <HI>Bethnimrah</HI> a City was seated. At the conflux of these
two, the <HI>Sea of Iazer</HI> is found, being no other then a Lake (about our <HI>Whit|tlesey
Meer in Hungtingtonshire,</HI> for greatness) as the <HI>Iews</HI> call the meetings
of all waters, whether fresh, or salt, <HI>Seas.</HI> Nor let their language herein
be challenged for impropriety, having a warrant from God himself,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 10.</NOTE>
who at the creation, <HI>called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the
waters called he Seas.</HI> Conformable hereunto is the expression of the
modern Dutch; for in <HI>Helvetia</HI> a Province of <HI>Germany,</HI> yea in <HI>Argow</HI> (as I
may say) a County of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">See Mercators Atlas in Hel|vetia.</NOTE>
<HI>Helvetia,</HI> I have told above sixteen Seas, <HI>Zuger|see,
Thuner-see, Ober-see, Rot-see,</HI> &amp;c. though the biggest of them but
lakes in effect. Yea the <HI>Iews</HI> did so far extend, or rather, so straitly contract
the word <HI>Sea,</HI> that, that capable vessell of brass, used as a Lavatory for
<PB N="76" REF="51">
the sacrifices in the Temple, was tearmed the<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Molten Sea. Iazer,</HI> which
gave name to this Sea, was a<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">h. 21. 39.</NOTE> City of the <HI>Levites</HI> hard by, whereat some
sad accident had happened, though the particulars thereof are not dis|covered
in Scripture, for <HI>the<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Jer. 48. 32.</NOTE> weeping of Iazer</HI> passeth in the Prophet as
the expression of great lamentation.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. Hence the <HI>river of Gad</HI> passeth by <HI>Civitas interammis,</HI> or the <HI>City in
the midst of the river,</HI> wherewith on all sides it is environed, never mentio|ned
in Scripture but with the company of<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Deut. 2. 36. &amp; Josh. 13. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Aroer:</HI> a clear evidence both
of their distinction and vicinity. Hereabouts <HI>Ioab</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 24. 5.</NOTE> pitched his tent,
when sent to number the people. Wonder not that having the conve|nience
of three Cities so near to receive him, he preferred rather to re|side
in a tent during that imployment. For (besides that such movable
habitations comply best with military men) it was fittest for the work
in hand; where the people to be reckoned might have full and free ac|cesse
in open aire; both wholsomer for the persons, and speedyer in dis|patch,
then when pent within the streets and walls of a City. Nothing
else memorable remains in the southeast corner of this Tribe, save <HI>Dibon,</HI>
a City sometimes assigned to<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 13. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Reuben,</HI> and sometimes to<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Num. 32. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Gad.</HI> To
reconcile this, some make them different and distant Cities; which in
my apprehension is rather to set up two marks then to hit the right one.
For seeing these two Tribes confine together, and both lay claim to
<HI>Dibon</HI> (like the two mothers challenging the living childe) we have
onely, in stead of a sword, made use of pricks, setting it equally in the
bounds of both. Here we advise the Reader (not out of distrust of his
skill, but desire of his good) to beware, neither to confound this <HI>Dibon
in Gad,</HI> with<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Num. 33. 45.</NOTE> <HI>Dibon-Gad,</HI> the thirty ninth station of the <HI>Israelites</HI> as they
came out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> nor with another<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Neh. 11. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Dibon,</HI> which seems to be in <HI>Iudah,</HI>
wherein the <HI>Iews</HI> dwelt after their captivity.</P>
<P>&sect; 9. The river of <HI>Iabbok</HI> arising out of the aforesaid stony countrey,
first runs directly northward, and strengthened with an acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ion of
waters from the <HI>Kingdome of Ammon,</HI> turns his stream full west. In which
course ere long he cometh to the ford which <HI>Iacob</HI> with his family pas|sed
over: and where we crave the Readers leave for a while to discon|tinue
our discourse of this river, and to attend that worthy Patriarch in
his travels through this Tribe, which in form of a Belt crossed <HI>Gad</HI>
athwart from northeast to southwest. <HI>Iacob</HI> first entring into this Tribe
came to <HI>Nahanaim,</HI> that is, <HI>the two campes,</HI> because there the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gen. 32. 2.</NOTE> Angels di|gested
into two armies (probably behind and before him) appeared
to <HI>Iacob.</HI> Now as<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Adams</HI> naming the Creatures argued his dominion
over them; so the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> naming of places in <HI>Canaan,</HI> was an Earnest
that their posterity should possesse them. Who no doubt, as curious to
enquire, so were carefull to continue those names which their Ancestors
had given them. <HI>Mahanaim</HI> was afterwards a<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 21. 38.</NOTE> City of the <HI>Levites,</HI> and in
the reign of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 2. 8. 12</NOTE> <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> the son of <HI>Saul,</HI> it was made the chief City of his

kingdome. But with his<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 4. 7.</NOTE> life within three years expired the <HI>Metropolis|ship</HI>
of <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> which afterwards afforded refuge and residence to
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 17. 24.</NOTE> <HI>David,</HI> when flying from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> for fear of <HI>Absolom.</HI> Hither the news
of <HI>Absoloms</HI> death was brought to King <HI>David</HI> (joyfull to the King, but
dolefull to <HI>David</HI>) which caused his patheticall<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 18. 33.</NOTE> lamentation over the
gate, till the heat of<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 19. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Ioabs</HI> anger dryed up <HI>Davids</HI> teares; perswading
him with cheerfull looks to countenance the conquerours.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. From <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> let us goe fairly, and softly on with an easie
pace in the company of <HI>Iacob</HI> (not overdriving his children and cattell

(the youngest warriour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gen. 25. 22.</NOTE> fighting before he was born, and the strongest
Conquerour) prevailed with God appearing like an Angell. Who in
admonition to <HI>Iacob,</HI> that he overcame not with his own striving, but
his opposites yeelding, gave him a gentle touch, being pleased, where he
could have broken the bone, onely to shrink the sinew, whereupon
<HI>Iacob</HI> carried an upright heart, and lame leg to his grave. Indeed
learned<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">In Genesin ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rcitatione 139.</NOTE> <HI>Rivet</HI> is of opinion, that God presently healed his halting,
chiefly grounding it, because <HI>Esau</HI> at his meeting took no notice of his
lameness: but doth not the negative follow with more probability, be|cause
the Scripture takes no notice of his curing? Besides, had the cure
come so quick, the hurt had never left so deep and long lasting impressi|on
in the practise of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> abstaining, for that cause, from eating
the<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 32. 32.</NOTE> sinew in the thigh. Yea modern <HI>Iews</HI> (oh that they were as obser|vant

they would not give him good words, not more niggardly of
their victualls then prodigall of their<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 8. 6.</NOTE> taunts unto him. Wherefore <HI>Gide|on</HI>
in his return (not then at leasure, that his wrath should hinder his

his liberty to receive or reject it. There was a Countrey, undoubtedly in

may not this in probability be the very place, where the <HI>Israelites</HI> former|ly
dwelled in tents, and in <HI>Davids</HI> victorious reign were reduced to more
stability, and incouraged to turn their tents into houses, more certain
and solid habitations?</P>
<P>&sect; 14. To return now to the river <HI>Iabbok,</HI> half impatient for our long

the shade of <HI>the forest of Ephraim,</HI> so called, as learned men con|jecture,
(for otherwise <HI>Ephraim</HI> possessed not any thing on this side <HI>Ior|dan</HI>)
because there<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 12. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Iephtha</HI> defeated the <HI>Ephraimites</HI> for their insolent mu|tiny
against him. But afterwards a greater slaughter happened in the

not that sticks had a mouth more voracious then steel, understand it that
some were devoured by beasts, others famished as lost in the labyrinths
of the forest, and some staked on sharp piles in the fierceness of their
flight. Well might such sad fate befall the common souldiers, which
happened to <HI>Absalom</HI> himself. This was he that boasted how upright he
would be when made a<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 15. 4.</NOTE> Judge, whereas now, if the length of his hair
conduced any thing to his execution, it was the best, yea onely piece of
justice performed by him. Yet more probable it is, that running in hast
(not so minding which way to goe, as to be gone) he was snatched up

parts, being the Gallows, Halter, and Hangman for a traitour?
But this accident rather occasioned then caused his death: the Oake

him with three darts through his<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 18. 14.</NOTE> <HI>heart.</HI> Wherein through a treble

there lie hard and heavy on his Corpes, and withall (if possible) sink
down his rebellious example for ever having a resurrection. No me|thodicall
monument but this hurdle of stones was fittest for such a
causer of confusion. Indeed in his life time he had erected a stately<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 18. 18.</NOTE>
Pillar near <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> intending it no doubt for the place of his buriall.
But just it was that his dead carkass should be deprived of his own

from him might be done by the <HI>Gileadites</HI> in heat of anger: Souldiers
in the Precipice of their passion being sensible of no other stop but the
bottome. If done by <HI>Iepthah's</HI> command, surely his own security

owner not having power to alienate it from his heires, to whom at the
farthest it was to revert at the <HI>year of Iubilee</HI> when all dead possessions had
a resurrection to their proper owners. We conceive <HI>David</HI> held this land
by one of the following Titles.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 <HI>By the fundamentall establishment of the Crown.</HI> For sure when that
Kings were made, publick provision was made for their Prince|ly
support, who (as Lords of Manors have commonage <HI>sance
number</HI> amongst their Tenants) might feed their cattell any where
in their own dominions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>By improvement of wast grounds,</HI> which fell to the King as <HI>Lord of the
Soile.</HI> Yea seeing God made provisionary Laws for the Kings
behaviour, (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deut. 17. 15, 16.</NOTE> four hundred years before any King was in <HI>Israel</HI>)
why might not a <HI>reserve of land</HI> be also left, at the partition of the
countrey by lot, for their Kings future maintenance?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>By mutuall compact:</HI> some subjects on valuable consideration, (as
perchance the relaxing the tribute due from every person to his

of their land for the Kings conveniency.</ITEM>

was undoubted in it self, free from the least suspicion of injustice, accor|ding

<P>&sect; 31. We have finished the description of this Tribe and all places
therein mentioned in Cononicall Scripture, onely there remains behind
some Cities which we finde in the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> in one<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Maccab. 5.</NOTE> chapter where|of
we may spring a whole Covey of Cities, namely these follow|ing:

these particulars.</P>

<ITEM>1<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1 Mac. 5. 26.</NOTE> All these were Cities strong and great.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Situated al in the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Mac. 5. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Land of Gilead,</HI> yea in this Tribe of <HI>Gad, Carnaim</HI>

<HI>Timotheus,</HI> that they <HI>would take and destroy them all in<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">1 Mac. 5. 27.</NOTE> one day.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>From which last clause we collect that these Cities must be placed
somewhat near together, otherwise, how could an army probably pro|pound
to dispatch them all in one day? And though the Pagans might
mingle much pride with their malice in projecting things high and hard
to effect, yet surely they mixed some policy with their pride, not to pro|pound
to themselves meer impossibilities. But the seasonable coming of
<HI>Iudas Maccabeus</HI> with his host frustrated all the Pagans designes.</P>
<P>&sect; 32. But the City of <HI>Ephron</HI> deserves serious consideration, for the sin|gular
situation thereof. For in <HI>Maccabeus</HI> his return from <HI>Carnaim</HI> this
strong City stood so in his way, that <HI>he could not turn from it either to the right
hand or to the left,</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Mac. 5. 46.</NOTE> but must needs pass through the midst of it. A place in
so tyrannicall a position may seem an affront to mans naturall liberty.
Yet such was the situation thereof near the<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Vide tabulas Adrichomii.</NOTE> confluence of <HI>Iabbok</HI> and <HI>Ior|dan</HI>
(where perchance the way railed with <HI>Morasses</HI> on either side) and
being a pass of importance, <HI>Maccabeus</HI> was onely free to go this or no way.
The <HI>Ephronites</HI> sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ible of their advantage undiscreetly deny him pas|sage.
Surely if a flying enemy deserve <HI>a bridge of gold to be given him,</HI> a potent
foe seriously proffering peaceably to depart, may merit a bridg of silver to
be lent him. But <HI>Maccabeus</HI> being denyed forced his way through the city
<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">1 Mac. 5. 51.</NOTE> <HI>over them that were slain.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 33. In the partition of the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> into severall moneths
for <HI>Solomons</HI> provisions <HI>the Tribe of Gad</HI> fell under three <HI>Purveyer-ships.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Of <HI>Gebar</HI> the son of <HI>Uri,</HI> who ranged over most of that land,

</LIST>
<P>By <HI>Mahanaim</HI> here I understand not onely the <HI>Levites</HI> City so named,
(poor purveying for victualls within the walls of that alone)
but a large Territory of the same name round about it. And although
to us it is unknown how far the bounds thereof extended, yet they must
be concluded either very large or extraordinary fruitfull, acquitting it
self as a twelfth part of the Kingdome, and affording Court fare for one
moneth of the year. In the passage to this <HI>Mahanaim</HI> on the south (to
retreive a place which otherwise had escaped us) lay <HI>Bithron,</HI> a petty
Countrey it seems, through which <HI>Abner</HI> passed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 29.</NOTE> when by night he fled
from <HI>Ioab.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 34. It will here be demanded, that seeing the land was by Gods
own appointment formerly divided into twelve parts, (the twelve
Tribes) adequate to the twelve moneths of the year, why did not <HI>Solomon</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="56">
rather make use of this partition, which was <HI>jure divino,</HI> then make a new
modell out of his own fancy. It is answered, this later division of the
land, was found most convenient for house-keeping, and so more sub|servient
to this particular end for which it was ordained.</P>
<P>If that any urge me to give a reason why in this division into <HI>Purveyer|ships
Ramoth-Gilead</HI> distanced some miles off, was added to the jurisdicti|on
of the Son of <HI>Geber,</HI> who was overseer in <HI>Manasseh,</HI> thereby mangling
and mutilating the intireness of the Countrey; let such first satisfie me,
why so many shreds and parcells of land (especially in <HI>Worcester</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Camdens &amp; Speeds <HI>Maps.</HI></NOTE> &amp; <HI>He|reford</HI>
shires) are cut off from those Countreys in situation, (yea are sur|rounded
with other shires) yet belong unto them in jurisdiction as ac|counted
members thereof. In all these Querees an ordinary eye might at
the first institution discover an apparent reason of such fractions, though
now, because long since <HI>time out of minde,</HI> the quickest sight cannot perceive
the cause thereof.</P>

<P>&sect; 1. <HI>_MAnasseh</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Ioseph</HI> by <HI>Asernath</HI> daughter of
<HI>Potipherah</HI> Prince-priest of <HI>On,</HI> was by his pro|pheticall

his younger brother. Not that <HI>Reuben</HI>-like he was
disinherited for any misdemeanour, but onely so it
pleased al-disposing Providence to transpose him.
However (though inferiour to <HI>Ephraim</HI> in power) he grew so great that
thirty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Numb. 1. 35.</NOTE> two thousand two hundred of his body from twenty years old &amp;
upward as able men to goe forth to war came forth of <HI>Egypt,</HI> all which
digging their graves in the wildernes by their own infidelity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Num. 26. 34.</NOTE> <HI>fifty two thou|sand

to their valour) as <HI>Gideon,</HI> and <HI>Iephthah</HI> the warlike, <HI>Iair</HI> the youn|ger,
the peaceable Judge of <HI>Israel, Eliah</HI> the Prophet; nor must the five<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Josh. 17. 4.</NOTE>
daughters, and coheires of <HI>Zelophehad,</HI> be forgotten, who argued their

rather then lose a rightfull possession, and a good cause when plainly
told, is learnedly pleaded, especially if a meek <HI>Moses</HI> or just <HI>Ioshua</HI> be the
judge thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. We are now onely to describe that part of <HI>Manasseh</HI> which was
east of <HI>Iordan.</HI> Some will say, was it not pity the possessions of this
Tribe should be thus dismembred? Was it not enough that <HI>Ioseph was
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 26.</NOTE> separated from his brethren,</HI> but <HI>Manasseh</HI> his Son must also be parted from
himself? How came that wisdome who pronounceth it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Psal. 133. 1&punc;</NOTE> <HI>good and plea|sant
for brethren to live together in unity,</HI> to cleave this Tribe asunder? But let
such know, that unity in affection may consist with locall separation.
Besides, divine Providence might seem to have a designe herein, that
this Tribe of <HI>Manasseh</HI> having a joint interest on both sides of <HI>Iordan,</HI>
might claspe these Countries together: and the <HI>Manassites</HI> being (as I may
say) <HI>Amphibii,</HI> on both sides of the River, might by visits amongst their
<PB N="92" REF="59">
kindred, continue a correspondency and civill communion one with
another.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. <HI>Manasseh</HI> had mount <HI>Hermon</HI> and <HI>Gilead</HI> on the east, parting it
from the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> and <HI>Ismaelites, Iordan</HI> on the west, <HI>Gad</HI> on the south,
<HI>Syria,</HI> and particularly the kingdomes of <HI>Geshur</HI> and <HI>Maachah</HI> on the
north. In which compass of ground,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Deut. 3. 4, 5. &amp; Iosh. 13. 30. &amp; 1 King. 4. 13.</NOTE> <HI>threescore Cities with high walls,
gates and bars, besides unwalled towns, were contained.</HI> Many will be amazed at
this number, &amp; the wonder will seem the greater when they shall reckon
but<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19.</NOTE> two and twenty Cities in <HI>Asher,</HI> nineteen in <HI>Naphtali,</HI> seventeen in
<HI>Simeon,</HI> sixteen in <HI>Issachar,</HI> &amp; but twelve in <HI>Zebulun:</HI> unproportionable that
half a Tribe should have treble the number of Cities to those that were
bigger. All we can say herein is this, that being a frontier Countrey,
and being exposed on the north and east to heathen enemies, it must
have more fenced Cities, then the Tribes on the other side <HI>Iordan,</HI> which
were better secured by their situation. Thus the hem is turned in, and
sowed double, to prevent the ravelling out thereof. And if I reck on right,
there be more Castles in our marches betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> then in
all <HI>England</HI> besides. However, our eye shall not be evill at <HI>Manasseh</HI> be|cause
Gods was good unto it, who are so far from repining at, that we
rejoyce for the plenty of strong places therein; onely grieving that we
cannot give the Reader an exact account of their names, though we
will endevour our best in the following description.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Mount <HI>Hermon</HI> is the north-east bound of this Tribe, called by
the <HI>Sidonians<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Deut. 3. 9.</NOTE> Syrion,</HI> by the <HI>Amorites Shenir,</HI> by humane<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Prolemee <HI>&amp;</HI> Strabo.</NOTE> writers <HI>Hippus,</HI>
and <HI>Trachones,</HI> being a branch of <HI>Lebanon</HI> bended south-ward. A stately
strong mountain fixed on firm foundations, and yet the <HI>voice of the Lord</HI>
(understand the thunder with an earthquake) maketh<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Psal. 29. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Syrion to skip as
an Unicorne;</HI> and well may mountains dance when God himself shall
pipe unto them. The<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Psal. 133. 3.</NOTE> <HI>dew of Hermon</HI> is highly commended by <HI>David,</HI>
and brotherly love is compared thereunto, because (whilest heat of
hatred like a drought parcheth all to nothing) fraternall kindness dew|like
gives refreshment and increase. But how this <HI>dew of Hermon fell upon
the hill of Sion</HI> (mountains an hundred miles asunder) so troubled Saint
<HI>Augustine,</HI> that at last leaving the literall sense, he is fain to fly to a mysti|call
meaning. Others interpret that the <HI>dew of Hermon fell upon the hill of
Sion,</HI> because the fruitfull flocks fatted on that mountain came after|wards
to be sacrificed at <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> which is but a harsh construction;
as if one should say, <HI>The fruitfulness of Linconcolne-shire which falls on London,</HI>
because the fatted cattel thereof are sold and eaten in the City. But whilest
sundry Interpreters have severall wit-engines to draw these two moun|tains
together, our last translation saves their needless paines, rendring it,
<HI>As the dew of Hermon, &amp; as</HI> as the dew <HI>that descended upon the mountains of Zion.</HI>
Indeed it is the same specificall, though not individuall dew which
lighteth on both mountains, flowing from heaven the same fountain,
though falling on earth in severall channels.</P>

of <HI>Philip</HI> the brother of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 6. South of <HI>Hermon</HI> lay mount <HI>Gilead,</HI> famous for the interview of
<HI>Laban</HI> and <HI>Iacob:</HI> the former keen with anger (save that God in a<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gen. 31. 24.</NOTE> vision
took off his edge) overtaking <HI>Iacob</HI> charged him with a double action
of felony, for stealing himself, and his Gods away without his privity.
The first, <HI>Iacob</HI> confessed, yet pleaded not guilty to the second, but traver|sed
his innocency. <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> is made in vain after the thief and felons
goods, (or Gods if you please) for she, whose conscience would per|mit
her to carry away, cunning did perswade her to conceal them. <HI>Ia|cob</HI>
thus cleared (as it were by Proclamation) of Defendant turns Plain|tiffe,
accusing the Accuser for his false accusation. At last all winds off
in a good agreement, and an Instrument is drawn up betwixt them,
not in paper but in stone, interchangeably sealed with solemn oaths.
The Condition whereof, was to this effect; <HI>That if either of them should
passe that place to doe any act of hostility to other, he should forfeit his fidelity, and
be liable to divine justice for his perjury.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 7. This Pillar and heap of stones had a threefold name imposed
on it, called
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 By <HI>Laban,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gen. 31. 47.</NOTE> Iegar Sahadutha,</HI> that is in the <HI>Aramite</HI> tongue, <HI>A heap of

</LIST></P>
<P>Here was abundant caution, three names and two languages, and yet
nothing too much. For <HI>Iacob</HI> having formerly been sensible of <HI>Labans</HI>
notorious shuffling with him, knew the best way to finde sure was to
binde sure; and <HI>Laban</HI> being guilty, and therefore jealous, thought no
security sufficient. And therefore in their mutuall suspicions a Tripli|cate
was used in naming the places, that a threefold cable might not
be broken.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. <HI>Gilead</HI> was at first onely appropriated to that heap and pillar,
whence the name may seem to be translated to the adjacent mountains,
and thence transmitted to the valley in the east of those mountains, and
<PB N="94" REF="60">
thence imparted to some eminent persons born in that valley. For as

This <HI>Chorazin</HI> was the place where Christs miracles and preaching were

thirty five miles. Equall whereunto, by the favour of <HI>Iordan</HI> running
crooked, (though northernly more narrow) is the breadth thereof,
from east to west. In the time of our Saviour this Tribe was parcell of
two Tetrarchies. The north-east part thereof, belonged to <HI>Iturea.</HI> The

Hence their inhabitants became excellent Archers: and pity it was,
rhat their arrows were so often shot at a wrong mark, to kill and rob
passengers in their journey. <HI>Strabo</HI> calls the <HI>Itureans</HI> generally <GAP DESC="foreign">, and

their Countrey in some sort may seem accessary to their felonies (the
Receiver is bad as a thief) which, as the foresaid Author observes, in
her caves, woods, and inaccessible mountains protected those Robbers
from justice proceeding against them. Insomuch that the <HI>Romans</HI> were
fain to keep Souldiers in Garison against them (but who kept any a|gainst
the souldiers?) So that betwixt both, <HI>Iturea</HI> at that time may be
conceived sufficiently miserable.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. The south-west of <HI>Naphtali</HI> was accounted part of <HI>Galilee the up|per,</HI>
otherwise called <HI>Galilee of the Gentiles,</HI> because, as some conceive, the
people therein were commixed with heathens, and (being far from
<HI>Ierusalem</HI>) were more drossie <HI>Iews</HI> then the rest. Which is a most errone|ous
opinion. For how improbable is it, that our Saviour, who sending
his Disciples to preach gave them instructions,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Goe not into the way of the
Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter yee not,</HI> and himself never
stayed in <HI>Samaria,</HI> save as he took it in his necessary passage in or from
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Joh. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Iudea;</HI> should choose <HI>Galilee,</HI> if so debased with the mixture of <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
for the place of his principall and constant residence? Far more true is it
that it was called <HI>Galilaea Gentium,</HI> that is, <HI>Galilee</HI> the populous, because of
the multitudes of people, especially near the sea, wherein was <HI>Decapolis</HI>
(a member of <HI>Galilee.</HI>) And there one city, for want of room, may seem
to tread on another.</P>

<P>We are not bound to beleeve all these nine to have been Cities of con|siderable
strength, or greatness, as not so note-worthy in themselves as in
their situation. Because (though perchance otherwise poor villages)

they stood in the borders of this Tribe. Thus low shrubs growing on
high hills, or crooked thorn-trees set by the high-way side, are more con|spicuous
in the eye, and frequent in the mouths of travellers, then streigh|ter
and fairer trees which are obscure in the midst of the wood.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. To come to the particular description thereof; Amongst the
mountains of <HI>Libanus,</HI> we meet with one of eminent note, not onely
having a name peculiar to it self, but which from it hath also denomi|nated
the adjacent Countrey. This is mount <HI>Paneas,</HI> wherein there is a
deep hole or cave. And though places of this kind commonly have
more horrour then pleasure in them, this, besides its naturall beauty,
was adorned with artificiall structures in, and about it. Herein also was
an unsoundable spring of water, conceived by some to be the primitive
fountain of <HI>Iordan.</HI> Yet<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ios. de bell. Iuda. li. 3. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus</HI> tells us of <HI>Phiala,</HI> a spring above two
hundred furlongs off (and therefore out of the bounds of this Tribe)
into which <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch cast cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e to try the experiment, and it
was rendred up again in the streame of <HI>Iordan.</HI> Whence he concluded,
that this river entertained an underground intelligence with that foun|tain.
But we are not to take notice where rivers are secretly conceived,
but where they are visibly born: and therefore date the originall thereof
from the apparent heads of <HI>Ior</HI> and <HI>Dan:</HI> which keeping themselves sole
and single for a short time, are soon wedded together. And from the
confluence of their names and streams, <HI>Iordan</HI> is begotten.</P>

very subject to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 3. 15. Ier. 12. 5. &amp; 49. 19. &amp;c.</NOTE> overswell the banks; in which notion perhaps, it is
also called by the aforesaid <HI>Solinus, Ambitiosus amnis, an haughty and ambiti|ous
river.</HI> But what saith the<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Zach. 11. 3.</NOTE> Prophet? <HI>The pride of Iordan is spoiled:</HI> name|ly,
in some extraordinary drought (and thence dearth) which he there
foretelleth. To keep the golden mean; As <HI>Iordan</HI> sometimes must be
acknowledged to mount too high, so <HI>Naaman</HI> depressed it too low in
his valuation: whose ignorance and passion preferred<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2 King. 5. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Abana</HI> and <HI>Phar|phar,</HI>

<P>&sect; 9. At the aforesaid confluence stands the famous city of <HI>Laish,</HI>
which at first it seems was a free State, living in subjection to none, and
yet in slavery to their own intemperance. They were<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 18. 28.</NOTE> <HI>far from the Zidoni|ans,</HI>
that is, as<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Sir Walter Rawleigh Hist. World.</NOTE> one measureth it, about thirty miles: half that distance be|ing
too much to receive thence seasonable succour in their suddain sur|prize
by the <HI>Danites.</HI> In taking which town, the<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Deut. 33. 22.</NOTE> prophecy of <HI>Moses</HI>
was fulfilled, <HI>Dan is a Lions whelp he shall leape from Bashan.</HI> It seems that
the <HI>Danites</HI> came on the east-side of the City, and might for a time secret|ly
repose themselves in <HI>Bashan.</HI> Whence, on a suddain, Lion-like <HI>(saliant</HI>
in his Posture, when he seizeth on his prey) they leaped on the city, and
were felt being on them before seen coming towards them. The City
<PB N="107" REF="66">
was afterwards called <HI>Dan,</HI> and the <HI>Danites</HI> possessed a tract or territory
of ground, which otherwise seems to lie within the Tribe of <HI>Naphtali,</HI>
but was not possessed by them.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. But as we must praise the prowesse and policy, so we detest the
Idolatry of these <HI>Danites,</HI> who hither brought, and here erected, the gra|ven

in the days of <HI>Samuel.</HI> This place<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 7. 4.</NOTE> then purged, was not long after de|filed
again with the same sin. For here <HI>Ieroboam</HI> set up one of his golden
Calves,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 King. 12. 29. &amp; 13. 33.</NOTE> <HI>making Priests of the meanest of the people.</HI> And although where a
Calfe is the God, a wispe of Hay is good enough to be the Priest, yet
hainous was the offence, because done by <HI>Ieroboam</HI> in the disgrace of Re|ligion.
The erection of these Calves was pretended for the ease of the
people of <HI>Israel,</HI> to spare their tedious travell thrice a year to <HI>Ierusalem;</HI>
but in effect occasioned that they were sent a longer journey on a worse
errant, even into irrecoverable captivity. Thus to spare a step in the path
of piety, is to spend many in the ready road to misery.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. In the time of our Saviour, this <HI>Dan</HI> was called <HI>Cesarea-Philippi,</HI>
built in honour of <HI>Tiberius Cesar</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch. Who in so name|ing

more pomp then puissance to his Army, he placed so many Captaines,
seeing it is not the shining of the hilt, but the sharpnesse of the edge of

the Gods of the <HI>Israelites</HI> (though by <HI>Benhadads</HI> swelling words &amp;

then ever, during the <HI>Persian</HI> Monarchy, about two hundred six years; till
<HI>Alexander</HI> the great made her change her tune, alter her notes, and turn

sacked the City, putting such to the sword as resisted, and causing two

</LIST></P>
<P>And here, amongst the many voyages of our Saviour (who often
crossed the length and breadth of this sea-lake) let us take account of
some most remarkable. And first in generall we may observe, that after
the working of some extraordinary miracle, (which might have great
influence on peoples affections) as the feeding of so many thousands,
Christ presently put to sea (clouding himself in obscurity) and shun|ning
popularity so far, that it should venture a drowning, if offering to
follow after him.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. The first voyage we will insist on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christs first voyage.</NOTE> was when our Saviour sailed
in <HI>Simons</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Luke 5. 7.</NOTE> ship, who formerly had fished all night, getting nothing
save a drowzie head and empty hands, untill casting his net at Christs
<PB N="142" REF="84">
command, he caught such store of fish, both his and his partners ship
began to sink. O when will any earthly thing fall out even to our de|sires!
We always finde fish, either none at all, or too many; and a sur|feit
of wealth is as dangerous as a famine thereof. The fish were now
ready to return into the water from whence they came, and not by their
wit, but weight had caught their fishermen, had not Christ by miracle
brought all safe to shore.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. A second when the Disciples put to sea at the command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second voyage saves <HI>Peter.</HI></NOTE> but
without the person of their Master. Tossed they were on the waves,
rowing with great pains to little purpose, <HI>for the wind was contrary,</HI> till
looking at last<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t. 14. 24.</NOTE> they see <HI>Iesus</HI> walking on the water; Then were the
words of the Psalmist literally true,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psal. 77. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the
great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</HI> The Disciples unable to con|ceive
such a mystery conclude it was a Ghost. It is not worth our en|quiry,
what Ghost, or whence, good or evill, of man or devill, this wild
guess being the effect of their fright, then which no more professed foe to
a cleare judgment. Christ quickly discovering himself, <HI>Peter</HI> requests a
commission to meet him: which granted, he walks for a while on the
water, till his Faith first, then feet failing him, he began to answer the
name of <HI>Cephas,</HI> proving himself a <HI>stone,</HI> not by the stability, but the
heaviness thereof, <HI>and began to sink,</HI> till Christ saved him. Nor was
Christ sooner in the ship, but the ship was<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Iohn 6. 21.</NOTE> at the land. Thus those
many strokes at the oares which the Disciples had taken before, were
not meerly lost, but onely laid up, and now restored them in their speedy
arrivall. Yea the sails of the ship were not now on the mast, but in
the keel thereof, Christs person did the deed. Thus projects driven on
without Gods gracious presence are but driven on, whilest such designes
fly to their wished end, which take God along with them.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. The third and last voyage we will insist on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third voyage when Christ was fast a sleep.</NOTE> was when the ship
was not upon but under the sea,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Mat. 8. 24.</NOTE> <HI>covered with the waves.</HI> Yea, <HI>it was now
full of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mark. 4. 3. 7.</NOTE> water,</HI> and the Disciples of fear, whilest Christ him self was fast a|sleep,
having a pillow under his head, and a softer under his heart, a clear
conscience. See we here our Saviour a perfect, because an imperfect
Man, his infirmities speake the reality of his humanity. Working had
made him weary, weariness had caused him to sleep much out of a de|sire
to be refreshed, more out of a designe to be awaked. Here all cry out,
<HI>Master save us, we perish.</HI> Danger will make the profane to pray, the wil|full-dumbe
to speak, who will finde a tongue, rather then lose a life.
No doubt <HI>Iudas</HI> himselfe, who afterwards sold him, was now
as clamorous as any to be saved by him. Christ awakes, and rebukes
first the Disciples<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Mar. 4. 39, 40.</NOTE> for being too fearfull, and despairing, then the winds
and waves, for being too bold and presumptuous. Both obey, owning
their Creatours voice; as well may his words, who made them at first,
make them now to be quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="84">
&sect; 9. Many more were the voiages our Saviour made on the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Christ never sailed af|ter his resur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ection.</NOTE> as
when after the feeding of so many thousands, they had but <HI>one<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mar. 8. 14.</NOTE> loafe in
the ship,</HI> and on our Saviours caveat of the leaven of the Pharisees, their
jealousies grew solicitous for food. Had they not besides that one loafe
in their Cup-board, twelve moe in their memory (five at one batch,
and seven at another) on the recollection whereof their mindes might
feed, to depend on providence, especially whilest the founder of the
feast was in their company. But we who condemne them, are too likely
to commit the like distrust, if left to our selves, upon less occasion. To
return to our Saviour, it is observable that after his resurrection, we
read not that he sailed any more upon the Seas. For such a fluctuating
and turbulent condition, which necessarily attends sea-voyages, was
utterly inconsistent with the constancy, stability, and perpetuity of
Christs estate when risen from the grave. The firme land therefore
better agreeing with his fixed and immoveable happiness, thereon he
stood, and onely gave the word of command to his disciples at Sea, on
which side they should cast forth their net, when they caught so<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Iohn 21 4.</NOTE> many
fishes. And so much for the <HI>Sea of Tiberias,</HI> hoping that if the weakly
reader be sea-sick by staying so long on the water, he will instantly be
well upon our arrivall on the main land, to which now we proceed.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. As this Tribe did overflow in sea conveniences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The method of the future description.</NOTE> so it fell not
short in the commodities of the land. The countrey thereof was ena|melled

We will follow the chanells of those rivers, which will direct
us to the most considerable places in <HI>Zebulun;</HI> beginning with <HI>little

<P>&sect; 12. His short and secret abode at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vulgar error.</NOTE> long and publique
living at <HI>Nazareth,</HI> gave the ground to the then vulgar errour, that he was
born in this place. To foment this popular mistake, and disguise the

(whence groweth the length of his hair in most pictures) who by ver|tue
of their<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Numb 6. 2.</NOTE> vow were tied to many ceremonious observances. Whereas

as also for the fame that they had heard of him, who without study and
ordinary meanes became so incomparable a Teacher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John 7. 15.</NOTE>. And yet curi|osity
as much as true devotion may seem to cause this their attention;
seeing they who out of novelty were ready to eate his words, soon after
out of cruelty were more ready to devoure the speaker, contemning
him for the poverty of his parentage, person and kindred, and hating
him for the truth he delivered, <HI>that a Prophet is not without honour but in his
own Countrey.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 15. How this comes to pass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Prophets without ho|nour in their own countrey.</NOTE> let others largely dispute. We may in
briefe conclude, it is partly because their cradles can be remembred,
and those swadling-cloathes, once used about them, to strengthen them
whilest infants, are afterwards abused against them, to disgrace them
when men, and all the passages of their childhood repeated to their
disparagement. Partly because all the faults of their family (which
must be many in a numerous alliance) are charged on the Prophets
account. Wherefore that Prophet who comes at the first in full growth
from a far forein place (not improving himselfe amongst them
from a small spark, to a fire, to a flame; but sunlike arising in perfect
lustre) gaines the greatest reputation amongst people: Because in some
respect he is like <HI>Melchisedek,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 7. 3.</NOTE> without Father, without Mother, without de|scent,</HI>
whilst the admiring vulgar, transported with his preaching, and
ignorant of his extraction on earth, will charitably presume his Pede|gree
from heaven, and his breeding, as calling, to be divine.</P>

with full intent to cast him down headlong. All in vaine. For <HI>Christs</HI>
death was to come a clean contrary way, not by <HI>throwing him down,</HI> but
by<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Iohn 3. 14.</NOTE> <HI>lifting him up. And he passing thorow the midst of them went his way.</HI> Not
that (as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See them on the place.</NOTE> Rhemists interpret it, to make way for their transubstanti|ation)
he penetrated contrary to the nature of a body, thorow the ve|ry
breasts of the people, but that either he smote them with blindness,
that they did not see, or else struck them with fear, that they dared not
to stay him, the power of his Person wedge-like cleaving its way, and
forcing a lane for his passage in the midst of the people.</P>

the main bulk of his book deserves commendation, if not admiration;
no doubt at the first compiled, and since preserved by the speciall provi|dence

last book <HI>De bello Iudaico</HI> is the best Comment on that part of the twenty

punishment to save but fright the rest. Secondly, more discretion was
expected from a Prince, then from a rabble of people. Lastly, what

his power, though <HI>Coma~nder in chief,</HI> to pickout the fattest pastures,
fairest meadows, fertilest fields for himselfe, but (as if he counted it
possession enough for him to have gained possessions for others) when
the meanest man was first served, he was contented to stand to the peo|ples
courtesie, what they would bestow upon him. If it sound to the
praise of a Generalls valour, to come last out of the field when it is
won, no less is the commendation of his temperance to come last into
it when it is divided. In <HI>Timnath Serah,</HI> asked and built by him, <HI>Ioshua</HI>
afterwards was<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 24. 30.</NOTE> buried; and as Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> reports that in his time
the <HI>Sun</HI> was depicted on his monument. This I dare boldly say, that
whereas modern Heralds blazon armes by the specious titles of <HI>Planets,</HI>
their fancy is with most truth appliable to <HI>Ioshua's</HI> shield, <HI>bearing Sol and

when <HI>Tirzah</HI> was taken, <HI>Zimri</HI> either out of envy that the royall Palace
should survive him, or desire to prevent a more shamefull death, burnt
himself, and the Kings house together. We read of King <HI>Asa,</HI> that after

<P>&sect; 24. But the most<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Esay 7. 9.</NOTE> observable place in the north of this Tribe is

Synecdoche, to denominate the house from the principall materialls
therein, like <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> in <HI>London;</HI> not because wholly built, but onely
covered with that metall. But alass, what good would an <HI>Ivory-house</HI> do

Justice) was that <HI>voide</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 22. 10.</NOTE> <HI>place at the entring of the gate;</HI> of such a latitude,
that it was able to receive at once the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Iudah,</HI> with their
royall retinue.</P>
<P>&sect; 26. But amongst all the structures in <HI>Samaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Syria's</HI> streets in <HI>Samaria.</HI></NOTE> none more eminent
then the streets built therein by the King of <HI>Syria.</HI> A thing scarce to be
paralleled, that a forein King should be permitted to erect streets in the
Metropolitan City of another Kingdome. If any alledge that <HI>Peter Earl
of Savoy</HI> built his palace in the Strand (known by the name of <HI>Savoy</HI> at
this day) and that there is a street betwixt <HI>Aldersgate</HI> and <HI>Smithfield</HI> called
<HI>Britons street,</HI> from the ancient lodgings of the <HI>Duke of Britain</HI> therein;
neither of the instances amount to the matter in hand. The former pa|lace
being erected, as I take it, for the Earles abode here when in banish|ment.
And as for the latter, it appears not that the <HI>Dukes of Britain</HI> were
at any cost in building it: whereas the Kings of <HI>Syria</HI> founded the Fa|brickes
of those streets in the city of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and never inhabited therein.
It seems when <HI>Omri</HI> began the new building of <HI>Samaria,</HI> either he request|ed
the assistance of the King of <HI>Syria</HI> (as a neighbouring Prince in amity
with him) to help him in the work; (no shame to beg the first clouts of
friends, for an infant-city) or else the <HI>Syrian</HI> Kings civilly tendered their
service, to give it as good handsell to so good a work, or as a <HI>Royall Largess</HI>
amongst the inferiour builders thereof. For mine own part I conceive
that the Kings of <HI>Damascus,</HI> got some conquest of <HI>Samaria</HI> not mentioned
in Scripture, and then built these streets, as a monument of their victory
and bridle to over-awe the city. The rather because <HI>Benhadad</HI> being af|terwards
overcome by <HI>Ahab</HI> profered the like favour and freedome unto
him, if it pleased him to accept thereof,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 20. 34.</NOTE> <HI>And thou shalt make streets for thee in
Damascus, as my Father made in Samaria.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 27. We meet in Scripture with three famous sieges of <HI>Samaria.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">First siege of <HI>Samaria.</HI></NOTE>
Once when <HI>Benhadad</HI> not content with <HI>Ahabs</HI> submission, (profering
to hold all he had by homage from him) would have all the wealth of
the city <HI>in specie</HI> surrendered unto him, vainly vaunting that<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 King. 20. 10.</NOTE> <HI>the dust of
Samaria could not suffice for handfulls for all the people that followed him.</HI> Surely
the Scavengers were very diligent in sweeping so populous a place, or
else it was a most hyperbolicall expression. But grant <HI>Samaria</HI> could not
yeeld dust enough to fill the hands, the mountains near unto it could
afford dirt enough to stop the mouths of most of his army, who few
days after were thereon miraculously<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 King. 20. 21.</NOTE> defeated.</P>
<P>&sect; 28. A second siege was in the reign of King <HI>Ioram,</HI> when the famine
was so great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second siege of <HI>Samaria</HI></NOTE> that an Asses head, and a cab of dung was sold at un|conscionable
rates: the former for food, the latter most probably for

fewell, and surely not to drain peter to make powder thence, an inven|tion
unknown in that age. Nor was the sudden plenty, occasioned by
the <HI>Syrians</HI> flight, less admirable, all provision being brought down in
an instant to a very unexpected low price. So that he that here knew
beforehand what would be cheap or dear, needed but a few minutes to
make him a rich Merchant. But this showre of plenty caused a floud of
people to flock to the gates of <HI>Samaria,</HI> where that infidell Prince, who
despaired of Gods power and <HI>Elisha's</HI> prophecy, was<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 King. 7. 17.</NOTE> overwhelmed in
the multitude; living so long to have his eyes confute his tongue, but
not to have his taste confirme his eyes; beholding, but not partaking of
the plenty.</P>
<P>&sect; 29. The third and last siege when the city was taken and destroyed
by <HI>Salmaneser</HI> King of <HI>Assyria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The third and last siege of <HI>Samaria.</HI></NOTE> in the reign of <HI>Hosea</HI> King of <HI>Israel,</HI> a

throne. Of whom it is said, <HI>he was evill in the sight of the Lord, but<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 2.</NOTE> not as the
Kings of Israel, that were before him.</HI> It may therefore seem wonderfull that the

say? When a vessell is already brimfull, the addition of the least drop
more, will make it run over.</P>

charge to the disciples, when sent to preach, <HI>Into<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mat. 10. 5.</NOTE> any city of the Samaritans

whereas <HI>Naboth</HI> was stoned at<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 King. 21. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Iezreel,</HI> twenty miles and more north|ward.
To reconcile which difference, <HI>Rabbi Salomon</HI> conceives that
though <HI>Ahabs</HI> chariot was washed at <HI>Samaria,</HI> his armour was washed
at <HI>Iezreel,</HI> where (saith he) the royall armory was kept. Others fancy
an out-let of the poole of <HI>Samaria</HI> in the river <HI>Kison,</HI> which many miles
off glided by the vineyard of <HI>Naboth,</HI> so that his bloud might be carried
thither down the stream. Lastly, it is generally answered, that those
words, <HI>In the place,</HI> are not to be taken restrictively for the same numeri|call
spot of ground, but extensively for the same Land, countrey, and
kingdome, which then was fulfilled according to the Prophets predicti|on.
Not to say, that some understand, <HI>In the place where the dogs licked,</HI> that
is, <HI>pro eo quod, in stead, in lieu,</HI> or <HI>in requitall</HI> of thy cruelty, <HI>dogs shall lick thy

on the blessing side; all cursings and imprecations (save when of abso|lute

In this action, the <HI>Levites</HI> appeared in a double capacity; as publick

<P>&sect; 34. Here it will be demanded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they might be heard form one mou~t to another</NOTE> seeing the sides of this Quire were
so far asunder, how could the <HI>Levites</HI> voices be distinctly heard from one

Rabbin will have it) lay interposed betwixt them: and may not divine
service as well be warranted in a language unknown, as unheard; both
being equally understood? For answer whereunto, we must know,
that the very make, and fashion of these mountains (pick'd out by
Gods providence for that purpose) might advantage much the articulate
<PB N="192" REF="109">
audibility of the Levites voices, especially if (as some fancy them) they
bended tops, hanged over and leaned inwards, so, as it were with mutuall
consent, more conveniently to reach the sound from the one to the other.
We know what<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Giraldus Cam|brensis. <HI>See</HI> Camdens Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">in Merionith-shire.</NOTE> some have written of the mountains in <HI>Merionith-shire,
so even in height that the shepheards may talke together on the tops of them, yet so, that
if haply they appoint to meet together, they can hardly doe it from morning to night.</HI>
Besides, the people knew before hand, the very numericall words, both
of the blessings, and cursings, which the Levites were to pronounce, and
this rendred their voice intelligible at the greater distance. For, our eares
and eyes quickly own those objects far off, with which formerly they
have been familiarly acquainted. Lastly, the Levites uttered no long
continued orations, but short speeches severally distinguished, with the
full periods of the peoples <HI>Amen,</HI> which gave fair notice to their neigh|bours
on the next mountain, when to begin, and end their attention;
and sentences so plainly pointed, are more easily understood at greater
distance.</P>

<HI>all the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Deut. 27. 8. 32</NOTE> words of the law</HI> were written very plainly: not that all <HI>Deute|ronomy,</HI>

it is no whit materiall to know it, especially, except he had taught them

were guilty of abominable impieties. For, as water neither will,
nor can naturally ascend higher, then just levell to the spring, or foun|tain,
whence it is derived: so these people were capable of no purer
service of God, then as they were principled by this superstitious Priest,
who either did not know, or would not teach them the true Religion.
Yea, their practise fell short of his precepts, not worshipping one God
alone, but every city had also a severall<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE> Idoll to themselves, according

mount <HI>Gerizim,</HI> where a medly nation devised a miscellaneons worship
of God, rejecting all the Scriptures, save the five books of <HI>Moses,</HI> and
maintaining many abominable superstitions. And yet they were not so
bad, as <HI>Epiphanius</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Haeres. 9.</NOTE> makes them, charging them by a far-fetch'd conse|quence,
to worship heathen Gods, because placing sanctity in that

<P>&sect; 38. But the main difference in matter of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Samaritans</HI> for their own ad|vantage falsifie the text.</NOTE> betwixt the <HI>Sa|maritans,</HI>

where men ought to worship.</HI> The contest grew high betwixt them, each zea|lous
to assert the transcendent holiness of their Temple; insomuch, that
the <HI>Samaritans</HI> made the text false, to make their title true, wilfully de|praving
the originall. For, whereas we read in the Hebrew, both that

where afterwards their mock-Temple was set up, so to gain thereunto
the greater reputation of holiness. This false foundation laid, they pro|ceeded

And, if the <HI>Iews</HI> once offered to plead the originall of their

then the <HI>Samaritans</HI> to outvy them, derived the seniority and

<P>But, oh how light and slight, how few and feeble are the <HI>Samaritan</HI>
arguments for the place of their worship, if compared to the numerous,
ponderous, pregnant proofes <HI>Iews</HI> can produce, for Gods presence fixed
in <HI>Ierusalem!</HI> The <HI>Samaritans</HI> therefore were wise in their generation, to
admit alone of the five books of <HI>Moses</HI> for canonicall (wherein all their
supposed evidences, for the matter in controversie, are contained) seeing
otherwise, had they accepted of the rest of the Prophets in the old Testa|ment,
their witness had utterly overthrown the <HI>fundamentals of their Reli|gion,</HI>
which so frequently make <HI>Ierusalem</HI> the proper center of all pious

as of all the Tribes, most probable in after-ages to justle with <HI>Iudah,</HI> for

<P>&sect; 50. And now to take our farewell of the countrey about <HI>Shechem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two eminent oakes near <HI>Shechem.</HI></NOTE>
anciently called the<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Gen. 12. 6.</NOTE> <HI>plain of Moreh:</HI> two eminent oakes grew therein.
One, under which <HI>Iacob</HI> buried his heathen Gods, with the superstitious
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Gen. 35. 4.</NOTE> ear-rings of his family, wherein no doubt, Idols were ingraven. Ano|ther,
under which was a great stone solemnly set up by <HI>Ioshua</HI> with the

in case afterwards they should deny that God, whom then they gene|rally
resolved to serve But the question will be how this latter oake
was termed to be<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 24. 26.</NOTE> <HI>by the Sanctuary of the Lord;</HI> seeing the Tabernacle, and
the Sanctuary Lieger therein resided at<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 18.1.</NOTE> <HI>Shiloh</HI> in those days. If any say
that every place where men seriously set their souls to serve God is his
Sanctuary; they speake rather an Evangelicall truth, then a proper an|swer
to the present question. This inclines me to conceive, either that
by Sanctuary is meant that place of the Altar, which <HI>Iacob</HI> long before
thereabouts erected; or that the Tabernacle not far off, was brought
hither for the instant occasion, and afterwards returned back unto
<HI>Shiloh.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 51. <HI>Dothan</HI> lay east of <HI>Shechem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> where the <HI>Syrians</HI> were smitten with blindness.</NOTE> wherein the Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> for some
time made his abode. Here he was complained of to the King of <HI>Syria,</HI>
for being the pick-lock of his Cabinet-councels: and therefore an ar|my
was ordered to apprehend him. But why so many to attach a single
person and his servant? Indeed no more then needed. For <HI>Elisha</HI> alone
was an army in himself<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 13. 14.</NOTE> being <HI>the horsemen of Israel and chariots thereof&punc;</HI>
His servant seeing themselves surrounded cryes out, till having his eyes
opened, he discovereth themselves guarded with a fiery army on the
tops of the mountains. Thus Angels are good mens Janizaries to pro|tect
them, and those <HI>Natives</HI> of heaven grudge not to guard those, who
are onely <HI>free Denizens</HI> thereof. The <HI>Syrians</HI> are<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 King. 6. 18.</NOTE> smitten with blind|ness;

Prophet, <HI>the Seer,</HI> to guide them? He leads them, for the present, the
wrong way to their intents and desires, but in fine the right way to Gods
glory, and their safety; in stead of <HI>Dothan,</HI> bringing them to <HI>Samaria.</HI>
How easily are those misled who lack the use of eyes? And (alass!)
whither will implicire faith, and blind obedience steer the followers
thereof? Yet here all came off in a peaceable close; so that their lives being
saved, sight restored, bodies feasted, and mindes better informed, they re|turned

Prophet, so shall I be best used, and my ransome easiliest procured.</P>
<P>&sect; 52. This <HI>Dothan</HI> I take to be the very place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dothan</HI> where <HI>Ioseph</HI> was sold by his brethren</NOTE> where <HI>Ioseph</HI> found his bre|thren,

his brethren had removed their flocks, and which probably was not
far off, but some few miles from the former place. Wherefore, when for|merly
in the description of <HI>Zebulun,</HI> we placed <HI>Dothan</HI> in the northern
parts of that Tribe, threescore miles from <HI>Shechem,</HI> therein we were carri|ed
away with the common current of other mens judgements, and now
have watched our advantage to swim back again, and shew our private
opinion in the position thereof. And besides the aforesaid text, setling
<HI>Dothan</HI> near <HI>Shechem</HI> in this Tribe of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> it is proportionable to di|vine
providence, that the place whereon <HI>Ioseph</HI> was betrayed, and pit
wherein he was put, should in after ages fall to the possession of the sons
of <HI>Ephraim</HI> descended from him.</P>
<P>&sect; 53. But here a materiall Question will be started,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How this coun|trey was called the land of the Hebrews.</NOTE> how <HI>Ioseph</HI> could

the Hebrews at that time, <HI>had none inheritance in it, no not so<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Act. 7. 5.</NOTE> much as to set
their foot on?</HI> Say not that <HI>Ioseph</HI> being a child when taken away might be
allowed to speak incongruously; for we behold his words as uttered
by him when a man. And surely he, who then could expound dreames,
could express himself in proper language. Some conceive it was termed
<HI>the Land of the Hebrews,</HI>

<ITEM>3 <HI>The Land of the Hebrews,</HI> though not in linage, in language; the

time encroached on that Countrey.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To strengthen this last conjecture, we must remember that <HI>Melchise|dech

of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> still retained his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 14. 18.</NOTE> kingdome in the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> And
<PB N="201" REF="113">
it might be that the other Hebrews were ejected by the <HI>Canaanites.</HI> If so,
the <HI>Israelites</HI> afterwards got the land under <HI>Ioshua</HI> by a double Right, of
Conquest, and Recovery.</P>

not, that we cannot find the exact situation of this place. For Christ
chose it on purpose for the privacy and obscurity thereof. Thus though
willing<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 10. 15.</NOTE> <HI>to lay down,</HI> he was not willing to cast away his life: unfit to

The reader may judge whether these roots be deep enough to bring and

coming from <HI>Dan literall</HI> (long since carried captive with the rest
of his brethren into <HI>Africa</HI>) but as for <HI>Dan mysticall</HI> many have sought,
and many conceive they have found him in another and nearer place.

<HI>Aholiab</HI> that excellent artist: who was joint master of the fabrick of

the share of <HI>Iudah</HI> at the partition of the Countrey. And because the

Manna so equally, a <HI>homer for every man,</HI> should part the land so un|evenly,
that one Tribe should leave and another lack: so that the thirst
of <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Dan</HI> was quenched with those few drops, which over|flowed
out of the cup of <HI>Iudah.</HI> May such remember, <HI>Iudah</HI> was the

Besides, three of the <HI>Satrapies</HI> of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> are found in this

of their soile so stuck by their sides, it unactived them for
forein adventures: and natures bounty unto them gave their indu|stry
a <HI>Writ of ease</HI> to sit at home. And partly because, being divi|ded
(as an Island from the Continent of the World) in Religion

other nations: though since their wofull Posterity have proved the
Capemerchants of the world.</P>

the character of the Countrey on the credit of a late<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Morisons trav. part 1. c. p. 215.</NOTE> eye-witness:
<HI>A most pleasant plain yeelding Tyme and Hyssope, and other fragrant herbs

how plentifull this Countrey was, before barrenness by Gods appoint|ment,

<P>&sect; 9. To proceed in the road to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> (as the best guide to di|rect
us in the survey of the north of this Tribe) It passeth not far
from <HI>Shaal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">im</HI> a City of<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 42.</NOTE> <HI>Dan,</HI> but in the confines of <HI>Ephraim.</HI>
Where though the <HI>Amorites</HI> dwelt in despight of the <HI>Danites,</HI> yet the
Tribe of <HI>Ephraim</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 1. 35.</NOTE> made them tributaries. A little further, this high|way
takes its farewell of the Tribe of <HI>Dan,</HI> but with full intent
shortly to visite it again. For having passed over a corner of
<HI>Ephraim,</HI> which baggeth into the south, it returns into <HI>Dan,</HI>
and goes forward by <HI>Modin,</HI> the City of <HI>Mattathias</HI> and his sons,
where the seven<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Macc. 13. 27, 28, 29.</NOTE> sepulchers of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> (each a high Pyra|mid
on a square <HI>basis,</HI> and all mounted on a steep hill) are a
conspicuous sea-mark to the Mariners many miles distant. Chari|table
monuments, which being erected for the honour of the
dead, are imployed for the safety of the living! Few miles
hence this high-way finally leaves this Tribe. And therefore
we leave it, onely wishing the passengers therein a prosperous
journey to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> That such as goe thither about business may
dispatch the same to their own contentment; such as travell
out of curiosity may have their expectation so satisfied, as to coun|tervaile
all their paines and charges: and such as goe thither out
of <HI>superstitious opinion to merit,</HI> may have their erroneous judgements
better rectified and informed.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. Nor doth ought else observable offer it self in this corner
of the Tribe, save<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 21. 24. Iosh. 10. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Aijalon,</HI> (where <HI>Ioshua's</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg1">Iosh. 21. 24. Iosh. 10. 12.</NOTE> prayer arrested the
Moon to stand still) assigned by God to the <HI>Levites.</HI> But the <HI>Amo|rites</HI>
took the boldness to keep possession thereof. Hear the words
of the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Iud. 1. 34.</NOTE> Scripture, <HI>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the
mountaines: for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but
the Amorites would dwell in mount Herez, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim.</HI>
The genuine sense is, that though the <HI>Amorites</HI> generally pent the
<HI>Danites</HI> up in the mountains; yet in these three places (though
mountainous in their situation) they crossed their common custome;
not out of necessity, but designe, as sensible of their own profit
that these transcended the vallies in fertility, and therefore placed
themselves therein. Let others dispute, how it came to pass, that
the <HI>Priests,</HI> whom God intended <HI>men of peace,</HI> by their profession,
had a controversiall City appointed them, incumbred with enemies
so that they must win it before they could wear it. As also how
the <HI>Levites</HI> could live, when the Land allotted them, was seque|stred
in the hand of a forein foe. It will be for enough us to observe, that
in all ages the <HI>Church</HI> being imbarked in the same bottome with the
<PB N="212" REF="121">
<HI>State</HI> ran an equall hazard therein, according to her proportion. And
when the whole Tribe of <HI>Dan,</HI> like the <HI>Parish in generall,</HI> was strait|ned
in its processions, well might the <HI>Priests</HI> maintenance be abated
accordingly.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. We goe back now to <HI>Ioppa,</HI> where standing on the rocks,
an indifferent fight may easily discern those ships, into which the
heathen people of <HI>Ioppa,</HI> with much courtesie, but more craft,
invited the <HI>Iews</HI> with their wives and their children to goe aboard:
for they made them pay their lives the fraight for their voyage, wil|fully
drowning two hundred of them. Whose bloud <HI>Maccabeus</HI> re|venged
with a contrary, but as cruell an<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">2 Macc. 12. 3, 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> Element, burning all their
ships in their harbour, with such as were found therein. Hard by
is <HI>Iamnia,</HI> a little haven (which may be rendred <HI>Seaton</HI> in English)
whose mischievous intention against the <HI>Iews, Maccabeus</HI> punished
by<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2 Mac. 12. 8, 9.</NOTE> burning their towne by night. Which bone-fire was beheld,
two hundred and fourty furlongs off, as far as <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> A thing
not incredible, that fire it self should be seen so far, by the light
whereof other things in darkness are discovered, especially when
mounted high on its throne, with the advantage of pitch, cordage,
and other navall and combustible matter.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Moors</HI> Mapof <HI>Palestine</HI></NOTE> Some doe conceive that

<P>&sect; 13. This brook hath its birth and infancy in the Tribe of
<HI>Iudah,</HI> whence flowing into <HI>Dan,</HI> he runneth through the desert of
<HI>Modin,</HI> which is full of rocks, and those of holes, and those [once]
of men, flying out of the neighbouring Cities from the persecuti|on
of the <HI>Pagans.</HI> Herein a thousand of them were slain by the
fury of their enemies, or rather by the fondness of their own su|perstition,
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1 M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c. 2. 38.</NOTE> refusing to make resistance on the <HI>Sabbath day.</HI> A sad
accident. But the parent of a good event, because putting the sur|viving

a victory over the numerous army of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Macc. 16. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Cendebaeus.</HI> Nor will
any slight this brook as inconsiderable, when they read how it
ran in the midst betwixt the armies of the <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> and
was so deep, that the hardiest of the former durst not adventure
<PB N="213" REF="121">
to wade it, before first incouraged by the example of their<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Macc 16. 5, 6</NOTE> Gene|rall.
Except any will say, they did not so much fear the depth of
the river, as the height of the banks of the other side, to wit, the
puissant army of their enemies.</P>
<P>&sect; 14. Going further on the river, we come into the Countrey
of <HI>Makats,</HI> that is (as learned<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Vid. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">jus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>in 1 King.</HI> 4. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Tremelius</HI> well observeth) the bor|der
or boundary (if you please, the <HI>Marches</HI>) betwixt this Tribe and
their professed enemies the <HI>Philistines.</HI> It is impossible to define the
limits thereof, seeing the Countrey was the constant Cock-pit of
war: and the ground thereof, sometimes marched forward, some|times
retreated backward, according to the variety of martiall suc|cess.
Great is the difference betwixt the same sea, at <HI>high and low water
mark:</HI> and so this Countrey must needs be much disproportioned to it
self, when extended in a <HI>full tyde,</HI> and when contracted in a <HI>low
ebbe</HI> of success.</P>
<P>&sect; 15. In this Countrey of <HI>Makats Bethshemesh</HI> was a principall
City, belonging to the <HI>Levites,</HI> and reputed part of <HI>Iudah,</HI> but (except
some Labell of land tacked to <HI>Iudah</HI>) surrounded about with the
Tribe of <HI>Dan.</HI> A case obvious in the dividing of Countreys. Who knows
not how <HI>Worcester-shire</HI> hath speckled all the adjacent Counties with
snips and shreds belonging unto it, though environed with other
shires, and that at considerable distance? Hither the kine drawing the
Cart, and lowing as they went to their Calves at home, (nature in
them was not rooted out, but overruled) brought the <HI>Arke,</HI> and rested
it near a great stone in the field of<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 6. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Ioshua</HI> a <HI>Bethshemite.</HI> At what&punc;
time the <HI>Bethshemites</HI> were reaping their harvest in the valley. Instant|ly
at so good news, their Sicles lost their edges, and could cut no
more corn that day. The <HI>Arke-home</HI> is to be preferred before <HI>Har|vest-home.</HI>
But oh! how hard is it to keep hungry eyes from feeding
on forbidden objects! All the <HI>Bethshemites</HI> were <HI>Levites,</HI> but not
<HI>Priests,</HI> much less <HI>high-Priests:</HI> to whom alone (and that onely anni|versary)
the survey of those mysteries did belong. Besides at this
time <HI>Bethshemesh</HI> from a City, was enlarged to be a Countrey:
(such the confluence of <HI>Israelites</HI> from all places) Otherwise no back
of one City might seem broad enough for so great a rode,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 6. 19.</NOTE> where|by
fifty thousand and threescore and ten men were destroyed by the
Plague, for their Curiosity, in prying into the <HI>Arke.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 16. <HI>Gibbethon</HI> is another prime place in <HI>Makats:</HI> allotted by God
to the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 44. &amp; 21. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Levites</HI> of <HI>Kohath,</HI> and no doubt by them peaceably possessed
for many years, seeing nothing to the contrary doth appear. But after
the days of <HI>Ieroboam</HI> it is said to<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">1 King. 15. 27 &amp; 16. 15.</NOTE> belong to the <HI>Philistines.</HI> Probably,
when the <HI>Levites</HI> loyall both to God and their King, upon the idola|trous
defection of <HI>Israel,</HI> willingly<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 11. 14.</NOTE> deserted their own Cities, the
<HI>Philistines</HI> taking advantage thereof (when much good bloud is let out,

bad humours are nimble to supply the place) seised on this City. To
recover the same, <HI>Nadab</HI> the son of <HI>Ieroboam</HI> besieged it: but was so
far from taking the City, that before it he lost his own life, by the treche|ry
of <HI>Baasha</HI> conspiring against him. This siege continued more then

them man and wife: because <HI>Machaneh-Dan</HI> (betwixt <HI>Zorah</HI> and <HI>Eshta|ol</HI>)
was joint issue of them both. For when six hundred men out of these
two cities marched towards the taking of <HI>Leshem,</HI> here they<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 18. 2. 8. 11. 12.</NOTE> met (pro|bably

their Ancestour) without naming any intermediate places. As in all
undertaking, the first motion which founds and the last which fini|sheth

have any certainty from Gods word, or good Authors. On the rest we

Ensignes of our ignorance; others I hope will approve as the colours
of our modesty. Especially having done our best endevour in ranking
them; and in default of demonstrations, the most probability hath ever
been accounted the next heir apparent to Truth. The best is, such places
are onely of name, not of note; but once mentioned in<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 41, 42. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Ioshua,</HI> with|out

<P>&sect; 24. The bounds of <HI>Philistia</HI> are not precisely to be set down. For
whilest tame cattell are kept in pastures, beasts of prey (such this war|like
people) are onely bounded by their own ravenous appetite. The
best way to measure the borders of the <HI>Philistines</HI> is to behold the sins of
the <HI>Israelites.</HI> For when they were encreased, then the Countrey of the
<HI>Philistines.</HI> was accordingly enlarged. Thus in the days of King <HI>Saul</HI>
they roved, and<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 31. 10.</NOTE> ranged as far as <HI>Dor</HI> and <HI>Bethshean</HI> in the half Tribe of
<HI>Manasseh,</HI> and had Garisons in the heart of most Tribes of <HI>Israel.</HI> But
their constant habitation (their den, as I may terme it) was atract of
ground from <HI>Gath</HI> in the north to <HI>Gaza</HI> in the south. Some fifty miles
in length and about halfe as broad, in the lands allotted to <HI>Iudah, Dan,</HI>
and <HI>Simeon.</HI> Their government was a mixture of Monarchy, and Aristo|cracy.
<PB N="217" REF="123">
For as their chiefe Cities had Kings over them, which seem abso|lute
in their own dominions; so these kingdomes were but <HI>Cantons</HI>
in relation to the whole, as members making up one entire Common|wealth.</P>
<P>&sect; 25. There need no other evidence be produced to prove the fruit|fulness
of their Countrey, then the vastness of their bodies, whereof
the rankness of their ground must be allowed a partiall cause. Our Eng|lish
Proverb saith, <HI>shew me not the meate, but shew me the man.</HI> The well
batling of the Giants bred in <HI>Philistia</HI> (chiefly in <HI>Gath</HI> their Seminary)
being Heteroclites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 21. 20. 21</NOTE> redundants from the rules of nature, sufficiently attests
the fertility of their soil. Some of these Giants had their hands branching
out into<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 20. 6.</NOTE> six fingers, though they who had one fewer had enough to kill
them. Let Naturalists curiously inquire, whether or no <HI>this stock of Giants</HI>
be wholly spent in our age. And if so, what the true causes thereof.
Whether intemperance of diet, or over early marriage; seeing every
one that is raw to work, count themselves ripe to wed. Let them con|sult
whether nature hath not some other way recompensed in our age
that want of strength, by giving them quicker wits; wheras in volu|minous
men commonly there is much empty margent. However
mens lesser strength and stature amounts not to a proof of an universall
decay in nature,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Hakwels</HI> apology for di|vine provi|dence.</NOTE>
as a most learned pen hath unanswerably demon|strated.</P>
<P>&sect; 26. One thing more we must observe of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> that they
are also called <HI>Cherethims</HI> or <HI>Cherethites</HI> in<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 14. &amp; Ezek. 25. 26 &amp; Zeph. 2. 5.</NOTE> Scripture. Know also that the
<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 8. 18. &amp; 1 King. 1. 38.</NOTE> <HI>Cherethites</HI> were a kind of <HI>lifegard</HI> to King <HI>David.</HI> Now because it is
improbable that so wise a Prince would intrust his <HI>Person</HI> in the pro|tection
of the <HI>Philistines</HI> his conquered enemies: therefore learned
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Vid. ejus an|nota in locum pradicta.</NOTE> <HI>Tremellius</HI> by <HI>Cherethites</HI> understands such <HI>Israelites</HI> as afterwards posses|sed
the Countrey of the <HI>Philistines</HI> expulsed by <HI>David.</HI> Which seems to
some but a forced interpretation. For what unlikelyhood was it, that
<HI>David</HI> might entertain <HI>Proselyte Philistines,</HI> converts to the <HI>Iewish</HI> religion,
if there were such, to be attendants about his body? Not to instance in
the <HI>French Kings</HI> double gard of <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Switzars,</HI> as improper to this
purpose; (because though forein, yet free and friendly nations;) <HI>David</HI>
out of policy might retain such to wait upon him, both for their pre|sent
encouragement, and future engagements of the fidelity of the <HI>Phi|listines.</HI>
Whose service might not onely be free from danger, but full of
advantage, especially when they were under the conduct of so wise and
valiant an <HI>Israelite</HI> as<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 20. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Benajah</HI> the son of <HI>Iehojada</HI> placed governour o|ver

of <HI>Maoch</HI> the King whereof, <HI>David</HI> to save his life counterfeited himself
mad. But whether guilty or no in so doing, Divines have not yet de|termined.
It would incline me to the more charitable side, that he had
good warrant for what he did, because at the same time (understand it
immediately before or after) he composed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Psal. 34. &amp; 56</NOTE> two Psalmes. Which shew
his soul not out of tune solemnly to serve God. But <HI>David</HI> went to <HI>Achish</HI>
a second time, with sixe hundred men; (it seems upon better assurance
before-hand, then formerly) and was with great kindness entertained
by him, dwelt with him in <HI>Gath,</HI> and after obtained <HI>Ziklag</HI> from him;
and by <HI>Achish</HI> his minde should have been the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 27. 2, 3 5, 6. &amp; 2. 82.</NOTE> keeper of his head. <HI>Achish</HI>
the son of <HI>Maachah</HI> (tributary no doubt to <HI>Solomon</HI>) was King of <HI>Gath.</HI> For
<HI>Shimei</HI> confined to <HI>Hierusalem</HI> by <HI>Solomons</HI> command, and his own con|sent,

of most contrary posture and practise to a Snake: (nothing creeps
lower then the one, or soares higher then the other) except
agreeing in the generall qualities of quick-sight and subtilty. Here if
some say that the Eagle might have been the crest of <HI>Dan,</HI> they
will quickly retract their opinion, considering crests a modern de|vice,
and could not be born in that age, which was scarce conceived
three hundred years since. The standard of <HI>Dan</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Numb. 2. 25.</NOTE> was erected formost

<P>&sect; 1. <HI>_SIMEON</HI> second son of <HI>Iacob</HI> by <HI>Leah</HI> his wife
probably was active in the persecution of his
brother <HI>Ioseph;</HI> (therefore singled out in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 42. 24.</NOTE>

Whereupon <HI>Iacob</HI> jointly cursed them,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 7.</NOTE>
<HI>I will divide them in Iacob, and scatter them in
Israel.</HI> Which prediction took a threefold effect in this Tribe, namely
in their
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Paucity. Scarce any Tribe came<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Numb. 1. 23. &amp; 26. 14.</NOTE> <HI>more</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> not any by
much entred fewer into <HI>Canaan.</HI> So sensible was their diminu|tion,
that of fifty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nine thousand, but twenty two thousand two
hundred possessed their inheritance. It seemeth that the many mor|talities
in the wilderness did light heavy on the <HI>Simeonites.</HI> Yea
after they were setled in their possessions, the Text saith, <HI>they had</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 4. 27.</NOTE>
<HI>not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children
of Iudah.</HI> And although<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 4. 38.</NOTE> immediately after it is recorded,
<HI>that the house of their Fathers increased greatly;</HI> yet the proportion
is to be measured, not in relation of this to other Tribes, but in
the reference of these families to others in the same Tribe of
<HI>Simeon.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Obscurity. Neither Judge nor Prophet extracted from this
Tribe: save that in this dearth of eminent persons (famine
will make those crums to be taken up, which otherwise would
be cast away) we must take in<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Iudi. 9. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Iudith,</HI> with her <HI>Apocrypha</HI> atchieve|ments.
But most sure it is that one notoriously infamous,
namely<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Num. 25. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Zimri,</HI> the son of <HI>Salu,</HI> who defied justice, and boldly
avouched his adultery with a woman of <HI>Midian,</HI> was son to a
Prince of <HI>Simeon.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="228" REF="129">3 Dispersedness. Their Countrey was but a jagged Remnant ori|ginally

<P>&sect; 2. Yet in process of time, as the dispersion of the <HI>Levites</HI> was tur|ned
totally, so the scattering of the <HI>Simeonites</HI> was changed partially into
a blessing. Their locall mixture with <HI>Iudah</HI> begate a politicall confede|racy

<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Spirituall: they were hedged in by their habitation, in the right
way of Gods worship: so that, when the ten Tribes made their
idolatrous defection under <HI>Ieroboam,</HI> many of the <HI>Simeonites</HI>
persevered in Gods true service: <HI>and they fell to King Asa in</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 15. 9.</NOTE> <HI>abun|dance.</HI></ITEM>

King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 6.</NOTE> probable it is that a considerable number of the
<HI>Simeonites</HI> remained, as hath been proved before, by their habita|tion
within the lot of <HI>Iudah.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>&sect; 3. The Lot of <HI>Simeon</HI> was transcendently fruitfull&punc; having a most
temperate aire, insomuch that Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, in his time it was
termed <HI>Regio salutaris,</HI> the <HI>healthy Countrey.</HI> No marvell then if the Patri|archs
<HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI> having their choice of the whole Countrey, pre|ferred
to live so long in these parts. And the latter of them sowing grain
near <HI>Gerar reaped</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 12.</NOTE> <HI>an hundred fold,</HI> which was the greatest increase which
that Corn returned, which fell into <HI>good ground,</HI> in the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Mark. 13. 8.</NOTE> Gospell.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. In the north-east corner of this Tribe we find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> that mountain
before <HI>Hebron,</HI> to the<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 16. 3.</NOTE> top whereof, full twenty miles from the City,
<HI>Samson</HI> carried the gates of <HI>Azzah.</HI> There he laid them down, not in a
plain but steep place, partly in the gallantry of his strength, that not
faintness, but his free pleasure made him lay them down, and partly, that
in so conspicuous a place the <HI>Gazites</HI> might easier finde their gates there,
then fetch them thence. A little more westward, not far from the banks
of the river <HI>Sorek,</HI> stood the City <HI>Ziglag,</HI> which<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 27. 6.</NOTE> <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hish</HI> King of <HI>Gath,</HI>
bestowed on <HI>David</HI> during his abode there. If any demand why <HI>David,</HI>
when King of <HI>Israel,</HI> did not restore <HI>Ziglag</HI> to <HI>Achish</HI> again; let such
know, that (besides that Cities once passed into a potent hand, are too
precious things to be parted with) <HI>David</HI> being crowned King of <HI>Israel</HI>
had an undoubted right derived unto him by Gods grant, not onely to
this City, but to the whole Kingdome of <HI>Gath,</HI> and land of the <HI>Philistines,</HI>
which God had given to <HI>Iudah,</HI> though hitherto they were not able to re|cover
it.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Afterwards, whilest <HI>David</HI> was marching (at least wise in pre|sence)
with <HI>Achish</HI> against <HI>Saul,</HI> the <HI>Amalekites</HI> in his absence burnt <HI>Ziglag,</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="129">
carrying away all the people therein captive. Griefe hereat so prevailed
in <HI>Davids</HI> men at their return, that in anguish of their hearts, they were
ready to<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 6.</NOTE> stone him. Could better be expected from them? Behold
their originall, they were at first,<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 22. 2.</NOTE> <HI>men in debt and distress,</HI> whose severall
discontents made them generally contented to join together; so that
not <HI>David,</HI> but his necessities chose them to attend him, who now in ad|versity
discovered their impious dispositions. But <HI>David</HI> to avoid this
showre of stones ready to rain upon him, run for shelter to <HI>God</HI> his <HI>Rock,</HI>
in whom he <HI>comforted himself.</HI> Thus, as it is always darkest just before
the Day dawneth, so God useth to visite his servants with greatest affli|ctions,
when he intendeth their speedy advancement. For immediate|ly
after, <HI>David</HI> not onely recovered his loss with advantage, but also was
proclaimed <HI>King of Israel:</HI> though some war arose for a time between
him and <HI>Ishbosheth.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 6. But the most memorable places of this Tribe are seated on or
near the brook of <HI>Bezor,</HI> which arising in <HI>Iudah</HI> takes his course south|west,
not far from<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Ethar</HI> or<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 4. 32.</NOTE> <HI>Etan</HI> in the north-east corner of this Tribe.
In the rock of<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 15. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Etan</HI> near the City of that name <HI>Samson</HI> reposed himself,
whence the men of <HI>Iudah</HI> brought him down, bound with two cords,
and delivered him to the <HI>Philistines:</HI> but he presently found his spirits,
and in that place the jaw-bone of an Asse. Bad weapons are better
then none; and it matters not what they be, so that they be
weilded by <HI>Samsons</HI> arme, that, guided by Gods hand. This jaw-bone
which used to feed on grass, here eat up a<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 15. 15.</NOTE> thousand men. Hereupon
the place was called <HI>Rama-Lehi, the lifting up of a jawbone.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 7. Thus <HI>Samsons</HI> thirst of revenge was allayed with the bloud of the
<HI>Philistines,</HI> but the quenching of one thirst was the kindling of another.
How quickly can God tame fury into faintness with want of water!
In this straight he hath his recourse by prayer to God, who<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 15. 17.</NOTE> <HI>cleaves a hol|low
place in the jaw.</HI> Heaven can make <HI>dry bones</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 37. 3.</NOTE> <HI>live,</HI> yea give life to others,
as here to <HI>Samson,</HI> water presently flowing out thereof. Let poets fondly
brag of <HI>Hippocrene,</HI> a fountain from a horses hoof; most true it is that a
spring did flow from the jawbone of an Asse. Except any be pleased
(which indeed is most probable) not to take <HI>Lehi</HI> in Hebrew for the ma|teriall
jaw-bone, but for the Countrey thereabouts, so newly named by
<HI>Samson,</HI> out of a hollow place of the earth whereof, God produced this
fountain.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. Hence <HI>Bezor</HI> runneth by <HI>Ain,</HI> the onely City belonging to
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 21. 9. 16 &amp; 19. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Levites,</HI> in this Tribe. Indeed both<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> were cursed
to be scattered in <HI>Israel,</HI> and this City of the <HI>Levites</HI> scattered in <HI>Simeon,</HI>
may seem to be <HI>dispersed</HI> in a <HI>dispersion.</HI> One City it seems was pro|portionable
to this small and mangled Tribe. Thus even the poorest
must have some Preachers to instruct them, and afford those Preachers
maintenance for their instruction. At <HI>Gerar,</HI> the brook <HI>Bezor</HI> receives
<PB N="230" REF="130">
from the south a Tributary rivolet, fetching its fountain out of the wil|derness
of <HI>Kadesh,</HI> a place full of strong and stately trees. But what saith
the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 29. 8.</NOTE> Psalmist? <HI>The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness, yea the Lord shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh.</HI> As if this of all other was most sturdy and stub|born
to withstand the summons of Gods voice: but all in vain, the least
whisper of his mouth sending a palsey into the foundations thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 9. In the confines of this wilderness stood three remarkable Cities,
which (lest the Reader should mistake) we have marked with circles
on the tops of them. Not that any evill spirits moved therein, seeing
these were the places <HI>where David haunted,</HI> whilest <HI>Saul</HI> persecuted him,
and to whose inhabitants he sent part of his spoile taken from the <HI>Ama|lekites</HI>
for a present. An act no less politick then just, with the same both
discharging the shot of his former entertainment, and for the future ob|liging
them by his bounty to be really sensible of his right of succession
to the Crown. The first of these<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Corashan</HI> (<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 7.</NOTE> elsewhere onely called
<HI>Ashan.</HI>)<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Char. 4. 32.</NOTE> The second<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 8. 1 Sam. 30. 27.</NOTE> <HI>South-Ramoth,</HI> and<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Hormah</HI> the last and most ob|servable,
because of three eminent places of that name in or near the
<HI>Land of Canaan,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Num. 14. 45.</NOTE> Where the disobedient <HI>Israelites</HI> were destroyed by the <HI>Canaanites.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Where the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were destroyed by the penitent<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Numb. 21. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Israelites.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Where the Tribes of<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 1. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Simeon</HI> associating together de|stroyed
the <HI>Canaanites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Char. 4. 30.</NOTE> being properly in this Tribe.</ITEM>
</LIST>
We see that <HI>destruction</HI> (so <HI>Hormah</HI> soundeth in Hebrew) gives the name
to them all. And wonder not then, that in a Countrey the Seat of
war, there were so many towns of this sad denomination, but pray ra|ther
that God would seasonably settle a peace in <HI>England,</HI> lest therein be
found more <HI>Hormahs</HI> then were in <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 10. As for <HI>Gerar</HI> the City above mentioned, it was anciently a
kingdome of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> whose Kings seem all to be called <HI>Abimelech's.</HI>
To one of these <HI>Abraham</HI> falsely affirmed that <HI>Sarah</HI> his wife was his<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Gen. 20. 2.</NOTE>
sister: and afterwards <HI>Isaac</HI> (see the powerfull influence of Parents
faults on their childrens practise!) to another of the same name offended
in the like falshood. This latter <HI>Abimelech</HI> looking out of his window,
beheld <HI>Isaac</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 8.</NOTE> <HI>sporting with Rebekah,</HI> (gestures not unlawfull as done, but as
seen) and from this familiarity (greater his charity then <HI>Isaacs</HI> caution
therein) interpreted her to be not his harlot, but his wife.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. Afterwards <HI>Isaac</HI> outed of the City dwelt in the neighbouring
valley of <HI>Gerar,</HI> and whithersoever he removed, Gods blessing, and the
<HI>Philistines</HI> envy followed him. He grew fat in estate, his enemies lean at
the fight thereof, which made them spitefully stop the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 15.</NOTE> wells which
his Father had digged. Happy that they could neither dam up nor drain
dry the dew of Divine blessing, from falling upon him, which, if
possible to effect, their malice would have attempted. But <HI>Isaac</HI> after|wards
sunk these wells the second time, and <HI>he</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 18.</NOTE> <HI>called their names after the
<PB N="231" REF="130">
names by which his Father had called them.</HI> See his humility herein, not vary|ing
from his Fathers will in an indifferent matter, whereas many now
adays count it the greatest honour of this age, in all things to diffent
from the former. Besides these renewed wells, <HI>Isaac</HI> had new ones of
his own making, as namely
<LIST>
<ITEM>1<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Esech:</HI> that is <HI>stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> so called because his heardmen, and the <HI>Gera|rites</HI>
strove about it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Sitnah,</HI> that is <HI>hatred,</HI> so named on the like occassion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Rekoboth,</HI> that is <HI>enlargement,</HI> which he peaceably possessed;
<HI>God making room for him.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
The two former pass for the emblems of our militant condition in
this life, the last typyifieth our happy estate in a better, and more room|thy
place; <HI>In my Fathers house there be many</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 14. 2.</NOTE> <HI>mansions.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 12. This vale of <HI>Gerar</HI> was the Granary of <HI>Canaan,</HI> whither the
Patriarchs retired in time of famine; for plenty dwelt there, when
penury was elsewhere. Nor will it be amiss to insert the testimony of a<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Geor. Sands. trav. 3. b. 150. p.</NOTE>
Modern traveller, to shew how the Countrey hereabouts, even at this
day, retains an indeleble character of its former fruitfulness. <HI>We passed
this day through the most pregnant and pleasant valley, that ever eye beheld. On the
right hand a ridge of high mountains (whereon stands Hebron) on the left hand
the Mediterranean Sea bordered with continued hills, beset with variety of fruits.
The Champion between about twenty miles over, full of flowry hills ascending leasure|ly,
and not much surmounting their ranker vallies, with groves of Olives and other
fruits dispersedly adorned. Yet is this wealthy Bottome (as are all the rest) for the
most part uninhabited.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 13. From the vale of <HI>Gerar</HI> the brook <HI>Berzor</HI> runneth by the grove
near <HI>Beersheba,</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gen. 21. 33.</NOTE> planted by <HI>Abraham</HI> for the more convenient perfor|mance
of his devotion. Collect we hence that <HI>Abraham</HI> resided some
considerable time in these parts, seeing trees grow not up as <HI>Ionas his
gourd</HI> in a night, but must have some competent season to come to ma|turity.
But what was piety in <HI>Abraham</HI> in planting this grove, was pro|faneness
in his posterity to imitate. For after that God had made choice
of a fixed place (Tabernacle, or Temple) <HI>to put his name there,</HI> such as
elsewhere sacrificed unto him were not onely guilty of Schisme (sepa|rating
themselves from the publick worship) but flat Idolatry, serving
the true God in a false manner, namely, in a place prohibited. And
now it is seasonably remembred, that many ages after, <HI>Beersheba</HI> was an
eminent place of Idolatry. The<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Amos 5. 5. &amp; 8. 14.</NOTE> Prophet threatneth finall confusion to
such that say, in nature of an oath, <HI>The manner of Beersheba liveth.</HI>
It being probable that as the<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 King. 18. 4.</NOTE> brazen serpent set up by <HI>Moses,</HI> was af|terwards
abused to Idolatry, so this grove of <HI>Abrahams</HI> planting near
<HI>Beersheba</HI> was by his posterity perverted to some solemn superstition,
the <HI>manner</HI> or <HI>way</HI> whereof, <HI>secundum usum Beershebae,</HI> was a precedent,
or leading pattern for other places to imitate: as <HI>Act.</HI> 9. 2. &amp; 18. 25. &amp;
24. 14.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="131">
&sect; 14. But the City of <HI>Beersheba</HI> it self stood hard by on the brook
<HI>Bezor.</HI> The name imports, <HI>The well of an oath.</HI> First so called from<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Gen. 21. 31.</NOTE> <HI>Abra|hams,</HI>
then from<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Gen. 26. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Isaac's</HI> ceremonious swearing and covenanting with
<HI>Abimelech</HI> in that place. Now if Scarlet keep colour because twice died,
and therefore called <HI>Dibaphon,</HI> well might <HI>Beersheba</HI> retain her
name, twice on the same occasion imposed upon it.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Gen. 46. 4.</NOTE> Here God com|forted
<HI>Iacob</HI> in his journey down into <HI>Egypt,</HI> promising him safety and
sight of his son <HI>Ioseph.</HI> Many hundred years after, <HI>Samuel</HI> at<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Beersheba</HI>
set up his Sons for Judges, who degenerated from their Fathers in|tegrity.
In the division of the land into two kingdomes, <HI>Beersheba</HI>
belonged to <HI>Iudah,</HI> where<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 19. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Iehoshaphat</HI> set up Judges, and whither
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 King. 19. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Eliah</HI> persecuted by <HI>Iezebel</HI> fled for succour. Hence he fled into the
wilderness, leaving his servant at <HI>Beersheba.</HI> Not that he carelesly cast
him off, but as the case stood with <HI>Eliah,</HI> life was to be preferred be|fore
attendance, and one alone might shift with more secrecy then two
together. Besides, by the avoidance of this servant (probably no person
of extraordinary performance) divine providence made a way for <HI>Elisha</HI>
(one of more desert) in this vacancy to be inducted into <HI>Eliah's</HI> service.</P>
<P>&sect; 15. Coming still west-ward on the bank of <HI>Bezor,</HI> we finde
the place where two hundred of <HI>Davids</HI> foot being faint stayed with
the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 10.</NOTE> baggage, whilest the rest of their brethren pursued and conquered
the <HI>Amalekites.</HI> But these at their return denyed the two hundred stay|ing
by the brook, any part of their spoile, till <HI>David</HI> ordered it as
<HI>a leading case,</HI> that these which attended the baggage should be equall
sharers with such who fought in the battell. And very good reason:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 It was not laziness, but weariness kept them behinde. A stout
heart sometimes cannot help a fainting body. Wherefore to
punish sickness in them for a sin, had been height of tyranny.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Grant their tired bodies could not keep pace with their souls, yet
no doubt in desire they marched along with their brethren, and
perchance by their prayers facilitated their victory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 During their staying behind, their imployment was as neces|sary,
though not so honourable. The stuffe could not secure it
self, and the keeping of it in the others absence was a good piece
of defensive service.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Now from hence it appears, that in cases not provided for in the judi|ciall
Law, the Princes of <HI>Israel</HI> were intrusted with power to enact
Statutes, in a prudentiall proportion to Gods word, binding all in
their dominions to the observation of them. This ordinance of <HI>David</HI>
may from the place be termed the <HI>Statute of Bezor.</HI> Nor is it any news
for Laws to be made in open fields by rivers sides, our <HI>English</HI> Laws
having had their birth in so plain a place in <HI>Ronny-mede</HI> near the river
of Thames, where King <HI>Iohn</HI> and his <HI>Barons</HI> first drew them up together.
Yea, no fitter place for such solmn acts then a rivers side, where the sight
<PB N="233" REF="131">
thereof may be the remembrancer, <HI>that</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Amos 5. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Iudgement may run down as waters,
and righteousness as a mighty stream.</HI> Hence <HI>Bezor</HI> glideth into the Land of the
<HI>Philistines,</HI> whither in due time we will follow it.</P>
<P>&sect; 16. South of this brook lay the wilderness of <HI>Beersheba,</HI> often menti|oned
in Scripture. Herein <HI>Hagar</HI> and<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Gen. 21. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Ishmael</HI> wandred when the bottle
of water was spent, the last Legacy which <HI>Abraham</HI> bequeathed him. Oh
how she weeps, as if intending to refill the same from her eyes! but a|lass, that moisture so brackish would rather increase then allay any thirst.
And now what should she do? It was death to her to see her son die, and
yet that pity which would not suffer her to tarry by him, would not per|mit
her to depart from him. In this <HI>Dilemma</HI> of affection she resolves on
the distance of a bow-shoot,<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gen. 21. 16.</NOTE> as a competent mean betwixt presence and
absence, and disposeth her self under one shrub, her son under another.
Here <HI>Ishmael</HI> cryes and God heareth. The very worst in extreme want are
the object of pity, and though <HI>Ishmael</HI> had mockes for <HI>Isaac,</HI> heaven had
mercy for <HI>Ishmael.</HI> An Angel sent shews <HI>Haga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> a fountain, not now new|ly
created, but newly discovered to her sight. The object was there be|fore,
but the Organ not rightly disposed to behold it. How near may
men be to their own happiness and miss it; touching it, yet not seeing it,
till God open their eyes! More south in this wilderness was the <HI>Iuniper-tree</HI>
under which<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 King. 19. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Elisha</HI> sate so highly discontented. Coales of Juniper
we know are extremely hot, but is there any secret quality in the shade
of that tree, to put <HI>Eliah,</HI> sitting under, into such passions, as that nothing
but death would please him for the present? Sorrow bought him asleep,
and afterwards awaking, being refreshed with a cake of bread, cruse of
water, and comfort of an Angel he undertook his journey to <HI>Horeb.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 17. Not far off betwixt <HI>Kadesh</HI> and <HI>Bered</HI> is <HI>Beer-laha-roi,</HI> that is, <HI>the
well of him that liveth and seeth:</HI> so<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gen. 16. 14.</NOTE> named by <HI>Hagar,</HI> because there an An|gel
catechised, comforted, and counselled her to return and humble her|self to <HI>Sarah</HI> her mistress. By this well <HI>Isaac</HI> was walking and meditating,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Gen. 24. 62.</NOTE>
when <HI>Rebekah</HI> brought from her Fathers house first met him, in her
most modest behaviour. For at the sight of him, though at some di|stance,
she<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gen. 24. 64.</NOTE> lighted from her Camel, counting it ill manners to ride, when
her husband and master went a foot: as also to give an earnest of her fu|ture
good housewifery, that she would prefer industry before ease, honest
pain before pleasure. The she<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 24. 65.</NOTE> vailed her self, partly to shew that the beams
of her beauty were hereafter to be appropriated to <HI>Isaac</HI> alone, &amp; partly in
confession of subjection, being now under covert-baron, the command
and protection of a husband. Well, I dare compare, yea prefer this vailed
wives chastity, before the virginity of many vailed votaries.</P>
<P>&sect; 18. More south is <HI>the river of Egypt</HI> the utmost limit, not onely of this
Tribe, but of all <HI>Israel.</HI> Indeed by <HI>the river of Egypt</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> (often menti|oned
in <HI>Exodus</HI>) onely <HI>Nilus</HI> is intended. But this stream (which
some conceive is particularly called <HI>Shichos</HI>) is termed the <HI>River of Egypt,</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="132">
not because it is in, but is in the high way to <HI>Egypt.</HI> Otherwise, the travel|ler
who sits down on the banks thereof, shall never come thither. In the
<HI>Septuagint, Rhinocolura</HI> is put for this river of <HI>Egypt,</HI> being a long named
city of short note, seated on the influxe thereof into the sea. Only this <HI>Rhi|nocolura</HI>
is famous in heathen History, because hither (as into an Hospi|tall)
all those malefactors were sent, whose noses were cut off for their
offences: a punishment inflicted on the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> King
who conquered them Hence had it the name of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Strabo Geog. lib. 16. p. 759.</NOTE> <HI>Rhinocolura,</HI> or the place
of <HI>nose-maimed</HI> people. But &ocirc; how great must that city be which in our
age should contain all those, whose faces are nose-less, not by others cru|elty,
but their own luxury!</P>
<P>&sect; 19. As for other cities in this Tribe of <HI>Simeon</HI> they were many, but
obscure. It is observable that most of them are written with an <HI>Ali&agrave;s</HI>
first, as they are named <HI>Iosh.</HI> 19. secondly, as they are called <HI>1 Chron. 2.</HI>
None need to wonder at their different denominations. Here I interpose
nothing of the severall writing of the same places
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 According to exact Criticks in spelling them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 According to vulgar tongues in pronouncing them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Onely we commend to the Readers notice, that the book of <HI>Chronicles</HI>
was written after the return from<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 3. 19.</NOTE> Captivity; and about eighteen gene|rations
after the days of <HI>Ioshua.</HI> And therefore some difference of letters
after so large a time is no strange thing. For seeing <HI>here we have no continu|ing</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Heb. 13. 14.</NOTE>
<HI>city,</HI> it cannot be expected that any city should have a continuing
name. And yet great places longest retain their names unaltered, (as
<HI>London</HI> from <HI>Taeitus</HI> to our times) whereas small cities like these in <HI>Si|meon</HI>
are as often alterable, as passed into the possession of severall ow|ners.
Yea seeing it was the custome of the <HI>Iews, to</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Psal. 19. 11.</NOTE> <HI>call their lands after
their own names,</HI> this haply might change<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Beth-lebaoth</HI> in this Tribe, into

<P>&sect; 20. So much of this small Tribe, whose portion was too little
for his people, and therefore they made two happy expeditions to en|large
their quarters: one in the reign of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 4. 39.</NOTE> <HI>Hezekiah to the entrance of Gedor, e|ven
unto the east side of the valley, a place of good and fat pasture; for they of Ham

teach them which is best for their palate: and those heathen were wise
enough to settle themselves in the richest soile, whence now the <HI>Simeo|nites</HI>
expelled them. This <HI>Gedor</HI> was in the division of the land allotted to
the Tribe of<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 15. 58.</NOTE> <HI>Iudah.</HI> Now if any demand by what right the <HI>Simeonites</HI>
might invade this which was assigned to <HI>Iudah,</HI> they may know that in
case a strong hold could not be reduced into subjection by that Tribe to
which it belonged, it was not an act of injustice, but valour, for the next
Tribe to<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Iud. 1. 34. 35.</NOTE> undertake the conquest thereof: As by their judiciall law if

in <HI>Gedor</HI> to profit, by casting out the heathen who violently detained
it, <HI>Simeon</HI> (his next neighbour in situation) suecceding to the right of his
brother, attempted and effected the conquest thereof: Herein onely it
holds not proportion, because the seed so raised up was accounted to his
dead brother, whereas here <HI>Simeon</HI> made bold himself quietly to possess
what victoriously he had acquired. Wonder not that this petty Tribe in
overcoming <HI>Gedor</HI> did more then puissant <HI>Iudah</HI> could performe; for <HI>al|ways

of <HI>Philistines</HI> inhabiting the sea coasts, allotted to, but never posses|sed

to the Merchant for the <HI>stuffe,</HI> nor Taylor for <HI>making of them,</HI> but (know|ing

directly to<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Judg. 14. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Askelon,</HI> where finding thirty <HI>Philistines,</HI> he bestowed their
corps on the earth, and their cases on their fellow-countrey men. This
caused that active antipathy betwixt <HI>Askelon</HI> and <HI>Israel, Tell it not in Gath,

<P>&sect; 22. Going along south by the sea side (here styled the <HI>sea of the Phili|stines</HI>)
we come at last to <HI>Azzah,</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Exod. 23. 31.</NOTE> or <HI>Gaza</HI> the fifth satrapy of the <HI>Philistines,</HI>

<HI>Samson,</HI> who carried the gates thereof away, could not bring himself hi|ther
again, without the guidance of another. Pain here was added to
his blindness, when set to grinde in a mill; scorn to his pain, when sent
for, at a solemn feast to be the musician to make sport, or rather the In|strument
ready tuned for every wanton eye, tongue, and hand to play
upon. But such as mock at other mens miseries, sometimes laugh so long
till their own hearts ake. For <HI>Samson</HI> applied himself to the two pillars
most fundamentall to the roof of <HI>Dagons Temple,</HI> and by the strength of
his armes and<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Judg. 16. 30.</NOTE> prayers, pulling them down, killed and died together.
<PB N="236" REF="133">
Strange that his enemies knowing his strength resided in his haire, pre|vented
not the second growth thereof. But God first stupefies whom he
intends for destruction: <HI>Samson</HI> had lost his sight, the <HI>Philistines</HI> their fore|sight
at the same time.</P>

There needeth no clearer comment on the Prophets prediction,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Zeph. 2. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Gaza

their credit by their exemplary<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Exod. 32. 26.</NOTE> zeale against the Idolaters, but the
<HI>Simeonites</HI> had not recovered their reputation by any eminent act
by them atchieved. <HI>Moses</HI> therefore having no commission to recall <HI>Ia|cobs</HI>
curse, and loth to repeat it, (lest the double-cursed <HI>Simeonites</HI> should
be utterly disheartned) thought it in pious policy best to pass them over
in silence. Of such persons, of whom we would willingly say no bad, and
cannot truly say any good, it is the wise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t way to say nothing. As for their
tradition that the <HI>Simeonites</HI> were imployed to be Scribes and Notaries to
the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> it is enough to mention it, knowing no sound autho|rity,
whereon the same is grounded.</P>

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIBE OF BENIAMIN. CHAP. 12.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. <HI>_BEnjamin</HI> youngest son of <HI>Iacob</HI> by <HI>Rachel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ben-oni <HI>his name changed to</HI> Benjamin</NOTE> was by
his mother dying of him in child-birth named
<HI>Ben-oni,</HI> that is, <HI>the son of sorrow,</HI> but by his Father
called <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that is, <HI>the son</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 35. 18.</NOTE> <HI>of the right hand.</HI>
Say not <HI>Iacob</HI> did ill in altering the <HI>Will</HI> of his
wife, and revoking the name, the last legacy she
bequeathed to her child, seeing the alteration was perfective, and for the
advantage of the <HI>Legatee;</HI> not to say that <HI>Rachels</HI> pangs imposed that
name, and might be presumed scarce <HI>compos mentis</HI> in what she did. But
the main reason of the alteration was, because <HI>Iacob</HI> could not call his
son, but must recall his lost wife to his mind, so that his very name con|stantly
carried a coffin in the mention thereof. Highly he was beloved
of his Father; and good reason; First, because begot in his old age. Se|condly,
because the youngest: and affection, which always descends,
when it can goe no lower, settles it self. Thirdly, because he was mother|less.
Lastly, because brotherless, <HI>Ioseph</HI> being conceived dead, and so the
portion of affection due to him, fell to <HI>Benjamin</HI> as the right heir there|of.</P>

Strange, that strangers, being<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 50. 7.</NOTE> the Elders of <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Court and
kingdome, should so affectionately bemoan the death of a man no whit
related unto them. Surely the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did not <HI>weep-Irish</HI> with faigned
and mercenary teares, much less was their passion onely State-sympathy
and politick compliance, sighing and smiling with the sighs and smi|lings
of <HI>Ioseph.</HI> Rather it was because the endearing disposition, and
obliging goodness of old <HI>Iacob,</HI> living fifteen years with them in <HI>Egypt,</HI>
had gained the generall love of the land. Besides, they lamented his
loss as the death of their own grand-father, because he was Father to
<HI>Ioseph,</HI> the Father, founder and preserver of them and theirs in the time
of famin. If any demand why the <HI>Egyptians</HI> mourned for <HI>Iacob</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. 50. 3.</NOTE> three|score
and ten days, whilst <HI>Ioseph</HI> made a mourning for him but for<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gen. 50. 10.</NOTE>

heavenly happiness lamented him totally lost, whilst <HI>Ioseph</HI> not<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 4. 13.</NOTE> <HI>mourn|ing
without hope</HI> was more moderate in his lamentation. But whether
this solution be sound in it self, or the question exactly conformable to
the text, we remit it to the examination of others. I would rather know
the reason why this solemnity of sorrow, was performed in this place,
rather then at the cave of <HI>Machpelah</HI> forty miles hence, where the corps
were interred; surely the <HI>Master of the Ceremonies</HI> in those days could give

conceived more for the state of the funerall. Unfitting it was, that the
body of that worthy Patriarch (to whom all the land belonged by
promise) should steale into that Countrey in a clandestine way, and
privately enter in at the postern door, rather let it solemnly surround the
Countrey, and be brought in at the broad gates. Thus the corps of

offerings, and (which was most acceptable) a zealous prayer reque|sting
wisdome of God, who bestowed both it, and wealth, and
honour upon him. Thus those who chiefly desire grace, receive it, the
jewell, and at least a competency of outward provisions, for a cabinet

lay in the south-west part of this Tribe, whose inhabitants were
bad men, but good<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Judg. 20. 16.</NOTE> markes-men, right shooters (<HI>at an haires breadth

then an heathen City, and (though late) recovered this <HI>Gibeah</HI> for his
lodging place. Alas, what was this, but <HI>from the fire into the furnace?</HI> so
excessive hot was the lust of the people of this City. But charity therein
was as cold, none inviting this <HI>Levite</HI> to his house, untill an old man

from his work</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Judg. 19. 16.</NOTE> <HI>out of the field at even,</HI> (Industry is the fewel of hospitality)
kindely entertained him in his house. In fine, the <HI>Levites</HI> concubine
was by violence, and variety of lust of the men of this City abused to
death. Oh the justice of divine proceedings! She had formerly been<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Judg. 19. 2.</NOTE> false
to her husband.
<Q><L>Culpa libido fuit, poena libido fuit.</L>
<L>By lust she sinned, and 'twas just</L>

This villany being declared to all <HI>Israel,</HI> a consultation thereon, and first

here, rather then within the walls of his royall City <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> for surely

<P>&sect; 2. Concerning the generall situation of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> three things here|in
are remarkable: first it was placed, as<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">De bell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Iud. lib. 3. cap. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus</HI> reports, in the very mid|dle
of <HI>Iudea.</HI> But herein criticall exactness is not to be observed, (the
heart it self is not so unpartially in the midst of the body, but that if not
in position, yet in motion it propends to the left side) for <HI>Ierusalem</HI> in|clines
more to the south of the Countrey. As <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was the navell of
<HI>Iudea,</HI> so the Fathers make <HI>Iudea</HI> the middest of the world, whereunto
they bring (not to say, bow) those places of Scripture, <HI>Thou hast wrought
salvation in the midst of the earth.</HI> Indeed seeing the whole world is a <HI>round
Table,</HI> and the Gospell the <HI>food</HI> for mens souls, it was fitting that this
<HI>great dish</HI> should be set in the midst of the <HI>Board</HI> that all the guests round
about might equally reach unto it; and <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was the <HI>Center</HI> whence the
<HI>lines of salvation</HI> went out into all lands. Yea <HI>Ptolemy</HI> dividing the (then-known)
world into seven Climats, placed <HI>Ierusalem</HI> as the <HI>Sun,</HI> in the fourth
Climat, proportionably to what is said in the<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 5. 5.</NOTE> Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>I have set it in the
midst of the Nations, and the Countreys that are round about her.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Secondly, it had high<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eusebius</HI> saith that <HI>Ieru|salem</HI> was cal|led anciently, <HI>Algariza,</HI> that is, <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> mountain.</HI></NOTE> mountains under it, and lower about it,
which as dutifull servants at distance seemed to attend it. <HI>Ierusalem</HI> had
a mountain for her footstool, and her floor was higher then the roof of
other Cities: no doubt the Emblem of the strength, stateliness, and
stability of Gods Church in glory. High and hard climbing thither, but
plain and pleasant dwelling there.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Lastly, it was distanced from the sea welnigh forty miles, ha|ving
no navigable River near unto it. For God intended not <HI>Ierusalem</HI>
for a staple of trade, but for a <HI>ROYALL EXCHANGE OF RE|LIGION,</HI>
chiefly holding correspondency with Heaven it self, daily re|ceiving
blessings thence, duly returning praises thither. Besides, God would
not have his virgin people the <HI>Iews,</HI> wooed with, much less wedded to
outlandish fashions. And if<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">In perap. E|vang lib. 12. cap. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Eusebius</HI> may be credited, for the self same
<PB N="316" REF="173">
reason, <HI>Plato</HI> in imitation of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> would have that City, wherein the
modell of his imaginary <HI>Common-wealth</HI> should be set up, to be seated
some miles from the sea, lest forein merchandize should by degrees
bring in forein manners into it.</P>

<P>&sect; 1 IT will be pain-worthy to enquire into the exact situation of <HI>Ie|rusalem</HI>
in what Tribe it was placed, the rather because severall

thereof.</P>
<P>For IUDAH. <Q><BIBL>Josh. 15. 63.</BIBL> <P>And for the Iebusites, the inhabitants of

<P>FOR BOTH: <Q><BIBL>Nehem. 11. 4.</BIBL> <P>And at Ierusalem dwelt certain of the children of Iudah, and of
the children of Benjamin.</P></Q>
This fifth and last place is a good Comment on the four former, name|ly,
that this City (though the <HI>Iebusites</HI> long disturbed their quiet posses|sion)
jointly belonged to both Tribes, neither claiming it totally as <HI>his,</HI>
both truly as <HI>theirs;</HI> Nor<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; 36. 9.</NOTE> was this any confused mixture of their inhe|tances
(flatly forbidden in the law) but methodicall (if not mysticall)
meeting thereof, so that <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> (which alone persisted loyall
to God and their King) had their possessions lovingly shaking hands
in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the solemn place appointed for Gods publick service.</P>

multitudes of People did inhabit, and three different degrees of the po|pulousness

Incredible it seems that so many should be pent in this place, except the
people therein (as when they crouded about Christ, <GAP DESC="foreign"><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Luk. 8. 45.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">

that flying thither for shelter, they had room enough, if they had but
room enough, not aiming at any convenient, (much less delightfull ha|bitations,)
but onely a bare lodging in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> where for the time being,
every single <HI>chamber</HI> was made a severall <HI>family,</HI> and every <HI>story</HI> multi|plyed
into a <HI>street</HI> whilest the fiege continued.</P>

<HI>his Vine out of Egypt,</HI> then also <HI>to prepare</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Psal. 80. 9.</NOTE> <HI>room for it,</HI> which he performed
here accordingly, even to admiration.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Now amongst the nativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> many no doubt were the
eminent Persons born therein, especially, if the Rabbinicall tradition be
true, that <HI>wheresoever the particular place of any Prophets birth is not set down, there
it is to be presumed that he was of Ierusalem.</HI> By this observation, <HI>Nathan, Gad,
Isaiah, Daniel, Hosea, Ioel, Habakkuk, &amp;c.</HI> should be town-born children
of <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> But we leave it uncertain whether this place gave the cradles

&sect; 10. Having thus surveyed the east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Corner|gate.</NOTE> south and west, come we now
to the northern part of the City. Where, first, we finde the <HI>Corner-gate,</HI>
whose angular position speaks it to participate of two points, being seated
in the very flexure of the wall from the east to the north. It was distanced
from the gate of <HI>Ephraim</HI> just four hundred cubits, all which space of the
wall was broken down by <HI>Ioash</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 25. 23.</NOTE> King of <HI>Israel</HI> when he conquered
<HI>Amaziah,</HI> that his Army might march in triumphantly with the greater
state. Pride we see hath not onely an high neck, but also a broad breast
(especially when setting her armes by her side) so large a passage must be
cleared for her entrance. Afterwards King <HI>Uzziah</HI> rebuided this gate,
and adorned it with towers, yea fortified <HI>all the</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 26. 9.</NOTE> <HI>turning of the wall.</HI> For,
as the elbows of garments ought to be made the strongest, as most sub|ject
to wearing out: so (walls being the cloaths of Cities, without
which they are naked) wise <HI>Uzziah</HI> adjudged it necessary, that this <HI>Cor|ner-gate,</HI>
and wall bending thereabout, should have most cost and care ex|pended
in the fortification thereof,</P>
<P>&sect; 11. No mention of the repairing of this gate in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why not re|paired in <HI>Ne|hemiahs</HI> time.</NOTE> which
prompteth us with these conjectures:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Either that it was then dammed up. <HI>Ierusalem</HI> after the captivity
being large in extent, and thin in people, (many uninhabited
places being left therein) probably in policy they contracted
the number of their gates, the multiplying whereof did require
more money and men to guard them. Or<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">For this gate is mentioned Zech. 14. 10.</NOTE> rather,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Being so lately built by <HI>Uzziah,</HI> it might notneed much mending,

</LIST>
For, in the sacking of a City it often fareth with the gates as with the
men thereof, it is hard if some doe not escape, and survive the destructi|on.
Yea, sometimes conquerours are pleased to spare some parcell of
walls, out of pity (not to the place but) to themselves, finding the
structure thereof of so firme constitution, that it requires more pains
then it will return profit in the levelling thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 12. Next comes the gate of <HI>Ephraim.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The gate of <HI>Ephraim.</HI></NOTE> so called, not because standing

some <HI>Ephraimites,</HI> after their return from captivity, dwelt in<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 9. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
from whose habitations hard by, this gate might, in probability, bor|row
his name; but prefer the former notation as most naturall. For
usuall it is, both for streets and gates, to take their denomination from
such places (though at great distance) to which they lead. Witness <HI>Ken|tish-street</HI>
in<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Stows</HI> survey of <HI>London. pag.</HI> 448.</NOTE> <HI>South-wark,</HI> for that it is the way (saith my authour) <HI>leading

<HI>Winchester-gate</HI> in <HI>Sarisbury,</HI> so named, because through it travellers pass to
<HI>Winchester,</HI> a City twenty miles off: and (an instance best known to
Scholars) <HI>Trumpington-street</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> so called from a village some

extant here, ever since <HI>Melchisedec</HI> was the founder thereof. If so, it was
an <HI>Old-old-gate</HI> indeed. But, as men having out lived all Registers, ac|count
themselves; so gates having outlasted all memories, are account|ed
by others, more ancient then truely they are. However, no wonder,

the west thereof. Whereas in Scripture we finde no express of fish for
mans eating (but one which eat a man, <HI>Ionab</HI> his Whale) mentioned
from thatplace, whilst whole sholes were caught in the <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> or <HI>lake</HI>
of <HI>Tiberias,</HI> lying north of <HI>Ierusalem&punc;</HI> Indeed <HI>Tyre,</HI> lying almost full north

appears in<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Nehe. 13. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Nehemiah</HI>) which through this gate was brought to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI>
Surely, the provisions of any populous place in long time will tire, if
onely going on feet, or flying on wings, and not also swimming
with fins, having fish as well as flesh and fowl for their repast,
as here in <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> And although no sacrifices of fish were by
God appointed to be offered unto him, yet hence the less wholesome|ness,
or cleanness of them cannot justly be inferred; because they were
improper for offerings, living in an element wherein men had no con|versation.

of the same name, in one City, no wonder, the double <HI>New-gate</HI> in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
the later new made postern into <HI>Moor-fields</HI> may be an instance there|of)

Sheep-gate. A gate ministeriall unto the Temple, (through which the
sheep were brought intended for sacrifices) and therefore, as it was fit
it should have the preheminence to be first repaired: so the Priests were
the most proper persons to be imployed therein. Of this gate it is solely,
and singularly said, that they<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nehem. 3. 1.</NOTE> <HI>sanctified it,</HI> which dedication speaks it

What, had their tender hands any skill to carve stones, or weak shoulders
any strength to carry morter? Or, was it sutable with the modesty of
their sex, to clime ladders, clamber scaffolds, seeing there is no acting
for any builders, but upon such stages? Surely they refused no pains pro|portionable
with decency to their power; and what was wanting in
their persons, supplied with their purse, expending it (perchanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">) out
of their own portions. And, if orphans money put into the <HI>Chamber of

that immediately upon the <HI>Iews</HI> return from <HI>Babylon,</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> Empe|rour
(from whom all Commissions were derived) would not entrust
any <HI>Iew</HI> with the sole rule of a strong City, but for the better security,
parted it betwixt two, who had joint, but distinct dominion therein:
That whilst they with mutuall jealousie observed the actions each of
other, both might preserve the interest of their Master.</P>

one giving stone, the other timber to that structure: so the building of this
gate was in like manner advanced betwixt them; but hence observe, that
it is no shame for one to admit a partner in that weighty work, which
he caunot weild by himself. Blame worthy their pride, or peevishness,
<PB N="327" REF="178">
who will not have that good design done at all, which can not all be
done by themselves.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Whereas <HI>Malchiah</HI> the son of <HI>Rechah</HI> is recorded builder of the

some<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Villalpandus in locum.</NOTE> conceive this <HI>Malchiah</HI> to have been a <HI>Rechabite</HI> by descent, and a
ceremonious observer of their Ancestours instructions, <HI>not to drink</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ier. 35. 6.</NOTE> <HI>wine,
nor build house, but to live in tents,</HI> with other Canonicall obediences. Nor
was this building of the wall of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> any breach of their vow;
partly; because a publick, no private edifice; and partly, because those
their ceremonious observances, probably terminated at the <HI>Babylonish</HI>
captivity. This <HI>Malchiah</HI> they make heir of the family of the <HI>Rech<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bites,</HI>
according to the Propheticall promise, that one of that house<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 19.</NOTE> <HI>should not
fail to stand before God for ever.</HI> But, whether herein Interpreters doe not
take more then the text tenders unto them, be it reported to others.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. It is signally observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Younger be|fore the elder in goodness.</NOTE> that <HI>Hanun</HI> the<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Neh. 3. 30.</NOTE> sixth son of <HI>Zalaph,</HI> re|paired
a piece of the wall. But, where were his five elder brethren? Were
they dead, or absent, or idle, or impotent? The Scripture giveth no ac|count
of them, onely the sixth son is recorded for his forwardness here|in.
In matters of piety, there is no standing on useless (yea on dange|rous)
modesty. No breach of good manners, to goe before our betters
in goodness, or for the younger brother in nature, to gain the birth-right
in grace.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. It is said of <HI>Baruch the son of Zabbai</HI> verse 20.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Baruch</HI> repai|red earnestly.</NOTE> (and of him alone it
is said) that he <HI>earnestly</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Neh. 3. 20.</NOTE> <HI>repaired the other piece.</HI> What, did the others work
but in jest, because this Accent <HI>earnestly,</HI> is onely put over the piece he re|paired?
Is not this mark of honour on him, a brand of infamy on the
rest? No surely, though probably his zeal was paramount in the em|ployment;
and what if the word <HI>earnestly&punc;</HI> (set there almost in the very
midst, amongst all the builders) be to be taken <GAP DESC="foreign">, relating to all the
rest, before, and behind it?</P>
<P>&sect; 8. It is observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persons repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ring against their own houses.</NOTE> that many men repaired onely <HI>against their own</HI>
<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 28. 29. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>houses.</HI> This, though at the first sight it may seem the fruit but of a nar|row
soul, and private spirit, yet effectually advanced the work. Yea, it
is particularly recorded of <HI>Meshullam</HI> the son of <HI>Berechiah,</HI> who likely
was but a lodger, and no house-keeper, that he repaired over<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 30.</NOTE> <HI>against his
Chamber.</HI> Oh, if order were observed for every one to mend his own
heart, or house, how would personall amendment by degrees quickly
produce family-city-countrey-kingdome-reformation? How soon are
those streets made clean, where every one sweeps against his own
door?</P>
<P>&sect; 9. Some doubled their files,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doublers with credit in the work.</NOTE> as <HI>Merimoth the son of Urijah the son of Coz,</HI>
who having formerly been a repairer (verse 4.) comes again the second
time to build (verse 21.) out of doubt the same person, as having the
<PB N="328" REF="179">
same name, father, and grand-father. Let him have double praise, for
his double pains; who not being weary of well doing, dealt with the
wall of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> as the <HI>Philippians</HI> with Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 16.</NOTE> <HI>once and again relieving
the necessity thereof.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 10. The nobles of <HI>Tekoah</HI> are taxed <HI>for not putting their necks to the work</HI>
<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Nehem. 3. 5.</NOTE> <HI>of their Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The degene|rous nobles of <HI>Tekoah.</HI></NOTE> Strange that now they should discover such unseasonable
pride. Had they not lately returned from <HI>Babylon?</HI> Could not seventy
years banishment from their own, and captivity in a forein land, hum|ble
them to purpose? Me thinks, so long suffering should have broken
(though not their hearts) their stomacks. But, oh the difference be|twixt
being <HI>low,</HI> and being <HI>lowly!</HI> No affictions, except seasoned, and
sanctified, are sufficient to bring down mens naturall corruption. This
negligence of the <HI>Tekoite nobility in Gods cause</HI> was so much the more con|spicuous,
because of the double diligence of the <HI>Tekoite commoners</HI> there|in;
for, they had two shares in this adventure, building, <HI>Nehem. 3. v. 5.</HI>
and again they had verse 27. another bout in the same service. Except any
will say, that by the <HI>Tekoites</HI> in the second mention of them, their nobility
are intended; who, sensible of their own dishonour, for their former
backwardness, played an after-game, to repair their credit; which is af|firmed
without any proof, and with little probability.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. Some here will demand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quaere concer|ning <HI>Nehemiah.</HI></NOTE> What did <HI>Nehemiah</HI> himselfe all the
while? did he onely look on, work with his eyes, and command others
to labour? Or was he like the <HI>Scribes</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Mat. 23. 4.</NOTE> and <HI>Pharisees, who bind heavy bur|thens,
and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders, but they themselves
will not move them with one of their fingers?</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 12. It is answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer, with his privative and po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">tive bounty to this buil|ding.</NOTE> his zeal was active, and exemplary in Gods
work, and therein expressed it self,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Privatively, in forbearing the salary of the Governour, which
his predecessours did, and he might justly receive. In this re|spect,
one may truly say, that each gate, tower, and piece of wall
in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> was in part repaired with <HI>Nehemiah's</HI> money, because
the builders thereof were the better enabled for that work, by
his remitting unto them, the taxe due to him as Governour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Positively, not onely forbearing his own right, but also bearing
a large proportion in the work. He kept a daily Ordinary (thanks
being the onely shot his guests were to pay) for an hundred and
fifty <HI>Iews,</HI> and Rulers, besides strangers of the Heathen. How
many attendants then dined on the reversion, at the waiters ta|ble?
and how many poor feasted on the fragments, at the Por|ters
lodge? It may be presumed many laborers at the wall had
gone supperless to bed, had they not repaired to <HI>Nehemiah's</HI> house
for their refection.</ITEM>
</LIST>
As for the opinion of <HI>Tremellius,</HI> that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> built the Kings palace at his
own charge, grounding the same on his own translation of the text,
<PB N="329" REF="179">
because I finde no other Authours to follow him therein, it is enough
barely to mention his opinion.</P>
<P>&sect; 13. At the Sheep-gate they began to repaire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusi|on of the work.</NOTE> and thereat also they
ended. The Gold-smiths and Merchants brought up the Rere of the
work,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Nehem. 3. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>betwixt the going up of the corner unto the sheep-gate.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 14. Within the circumference of the walls, lay much ground un|inhabited,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ierusalem</HI> em|ptied of inha|bitants, when rebuilded by <HI>Nehemiah.</HI></NOTE>
people being loth to live therein, except<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Neh. 11. 1.</NOTE> <HI>by lot</HI> compelled
thereunto, and all<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 2.</NOTE> <HI>blessed</HI> such as <HI>willingly offered themselves to dwell therein.</HI>
Strange, that the chiefe City should run so low in generall reputation,
the Gallants of our age being otherwise minded, all posting unto the
principall place of the kingdome, as the fountain of fashions, and all
delights. I read indeed of <HI>Histria</HI> a province under the <HI>Venetian</HI> Com|mon-wealth,
that they are fain to<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">terus.</NOTE> hire people to inhabit there. But the
reason thereof is visible, because of the unwholsomeness of the aire,
whereas no such pretence for any to decline the City of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> whose
elevated situation, conduced much to the purity, and wholsomeness
thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 15. But mens unwillingness to dwell therein,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why men loth to live in <HI>Ie|rusalem.</HI></NOTE> took the rise from
other reasons&punc; as namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 The common enemy beheld it with most envious eyes, as the
proper object of his malice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 The vast circuit of the City, put them to hard duty to guard it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Trading was dead therein, and little wealth to be gotten at the
new erection thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 All coveted the countrey, for the privacy, pleasure, and profit there|of.</ITEM>
</LIST>
However in after ages, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> grew exceeding populous, and had all
the vacuities thereof filled, yea crowded with inhabitants. Thus, as it is
most easie and thrifty, to make childrens garments too big for their bo|dies,
because they will quickly grow up to their clothes: so providence
advised <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> to make the circumference of Infant-<HI>Ierusalem</HI> the
larger, as which, in process of time, would soon spread it self, to the re|plenishing
thereof.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Davids Palace, the High-priests houses, the Coenaculum, and other
memorable places in mount Sion.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. WE begin with mount <HI>Sion,</HI> making that first which God
most favoured,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 87. 2.</NOTE> <HI>who loved the Gates of Sion, more then all the
tabernacles of Iacob.</HI> Here first our eyes are entertained with the stately
Palace of <HI>David,</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 5. 11. &amp; 1 Chr. 1 4. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Hiram</HI> King of <HI>Tyre</HI> sending him timber and work|men
for the building thereof. Flat was the roof of this palace, whereon
<HI>David</HI> sate, and from whence he beheld <HI>Bathsheba</HI> (hard by is her house)
bathing her self. I cannot excuse her action herein. If policy be jealous,
that hedges may have eares, modesty may suspect lest the motes in the
aire have eyes. But see here divine justice. As this roof was the place
whereon <HI>Davids</HI> lust did burn first; so thereon <HI>Absaloms</HI> incest did blaze
farthest, lying here with his Fathers Concubines. This he easily did at
the perswasion of <HI>Achitophel;</HI> those spurres needing no rowels, which are
to prick forward graceless youth into wantonness. But that hellish Po|litician
did this to set such a distance betwixt Sire and Son, that the af|fection
of the one might never meet with the submission of the other,
the breach hereafter being made so deep and wide, that no bridge of re|conciliation
might be built betwixt them.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Under the <HI>Romans</HI> this Palace was turned into a<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Act. 21. 37.</NOTE> Castle, where a
Garrison was kept to over-awe the City. Once the honour, now the
terrour; once the beauty, now the bridle of <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Upon<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 21. 40.</NOTE> the fair
stairs leading thereto, stood Saint <HI>Paul</HI> when he made his speech to the
people, hearing him with great silence, because he spake <HI>in</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Act. 22. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the Hebrew
tongue;</HI> untill he came to that passage of <HI>preaching to the Gentiles</HI> (which
though spoken in Hebrew was no good Hebrew to his auditours, but
<PB N="335" REF="182">
false construction, &amp; breach of Jewish priviledg) when they turned their
attentive eares into railing tongues, <HI>away with such a fellow from off the earth.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. And now to shew the frailty of humane happiness, pass we from
the palace of these Kings to their burying place, seeing <HI>Sion</HI> in a double
respect may be called the <HI>Westminster</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> because the Kings there|of
resided there while living, and rested when dead. The reader shall pay
nothing but his pains in following me, whilest I shew him these royall

admitted among the royall interments. Count it not presumption
for a Priests body to intrude amongst Princes bones, seeing not his pride
but the peoples gratitude preferred him to the place, because<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 24. 16.</NOTE> <HI>he had done
good in Israel towards God and his house.</HI> (Oh if monuments were mar|shalled

True it is, bodies flung in a bog, will not stick there at the day of judge|ment;
<PB N="336" REF="183">
cast into a wood, will finde out the way; thrown into a dungeon,
will have free egress; left on the highway, are still in the ready road to
the resurrection. Yet seeing they are the Tabernacles of the Soul, yea
the Temples of the holy Ghost, the <HI>Iews</HI> justly began, and <HI>Christians</HI> com|mendably
continue the custome of their solemn interment.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Farther off from the palace, we finde <HI>the house of the mighty;</HI> where
<HI>Davids worthies</HI> lived in a Colledge under <HI>Ioab</HI> their President, next the
Kings<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Zach. 14. 10.</NOTE> <HI>wine-press</HI> and his<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Neh. 7. 16.</NOTE> <HI>fish-ponds.</HI> Think not that the Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI>
had onely Crowns, Thrones, and Scepters, the Ensignes of Soveraignty,
for besides these to maintain their state, they had places of profit, so thrif|ty
as to make their own wine at the best hand.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Next we take notice of the houses of <HI>Annas</HI> and <HI>Caiaphas</HI> both a|live
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Joh. 8. 13. &amp; 24.</NOTE> at once, and termed the high-Priests at the same time; one by
courtesie, because lately he had been: the other by right, because at pre|sent
possessed of the high-Priesthood. Thus that function, which ought
to have been during life by Gods institution, was made alternately annu|all
by mans innovation. Was not the shining of two Suns together in the
Jewish Church sadly ominous? And was it not high time for God to take
away the office, when men began wantonly to play at <HI>in and out,</HI> with that
holy profession? But besides these two high-Priests, there was a third that
had more right then either to the place, our Saviour himself, at the present
brought a prisoner before them. In the house of <HI>Annas</HI> an officer wrongful|ly
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Joh. 18. 22.</NOTE> struck him with the palme of his hand, and in the house of <HI>Caiaphas</HI>
he was thrice denyed by<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Joh. 18. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Peter,</HI> adjured by the high-Priest, adjudged to
death, spit upon, blinded, buffeted, with other insolencies offered unto
him. The houses of the high-Priests were far asunder, all which distance
Christ traced on foot; and it is observable, that being posted back|wards,
and forwards, from <HI>Annas</HI> to <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> from <HI>Caiaphas</HI> to <HI>Pilate,</HI>
from <HI>Pilate</HI> to <HI>Herod,</HI> from <HI>Herod</HI> to <HI>Pilate,</HI> from <HI>Gabbatha</HI> to <HI>Golgotha,</HI> he
traversed all the length and breadth, and most of the considerable places
in the City: Partly to render his passion more publick, <HI>being made a
spectacle to men and Angels,</HI> partly that his <HI>beautifull feet might bring the Gospell
of peace</HI> into every principall street in <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 8. Next followeth the <HI>Coenaculum,</HI> or<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Luk. 22. 12.</NOTE> <HI>large upper-room</HI> where Christ en|ded
the Passover, began the Lords supper, and probably afterwards in the
same place appeared to his disciples, where after his ascension, the holy
Spirit<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 3.</NOTE> <HI>in fiery cloven tongues</HI> fell upon them, enabling them to speak all lan|guages,
for which some senslesly slandered them to be<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 13.</NOTE> <HI>full of new wine.</HI> For
the excess thereof may give men more tongue, not moe tongues; and is so
far from making them speak other, that it hinders the pronouncing of
their own language. As for the house of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> w^c^h some make
very fair in mou~t <HI>Sion;</HI> I say a better was beneath her desert, but a worse was

light on <HI>the</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 2&punc;</NOTE> <HI>house of the forest of Lebanon,</HI> built by <HI>Solomon:</HI> So
called, because an abridgement of that great forest, wherein (I mean in

Strange musick to be heard in the midst of a populous place; and very
pleasant, that such a woody retiredness should be afforded in the heart of a
City. Yet <HI>Solomons</HI> minde, when mounted on these seeming felicities, was
as far from reaching true contentment, as the tired traveller, when on the
top of the next hill, will be from touching the skies, which whilest he
was in the valley seemed contiguous thereunto.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. The length of this house was an hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dimensi|ons of this house.</NOTE> breadth fifty, height
thirty cubits, whereby it appears both longer and broader then the

Temple, onely the covered part thereof is reckoned on, without the
Courts (wherein the greatest capacity thereof did consist:) whereas no

his grandchild <HI>Herod Antipas</HI> Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee</HI> kept his passeover, when
<HI>Pilate</HI> sent <HI>Christ</HI> unto him to be examined by him. Right glad was <HI>He|rod</HI>

behold from our Saviour. For he that would not work a miracle at his

<HI>Herod</HI> take this for a sign that <HI>Christ</HI> was the <HI>Son of God,</HI> because he would
shew no sign for the will of man. However the silent shew of our

and being to dye the next day, was found in a dead<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Act. 12. 7.</NOTE> sleep the night be|fore.
I question whether <HI>Herod</HI> who condemned him, slept half so
soundly. He must be smote before he could be waked, and his shackles
fell off easier then his sleep. The <HI>Rhemish</HI> note tells us, that the chains
wherewith he was bound are still preserved at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Church of
<HI>Petri ad vincula.</HI> But if those there be the true chains, I dare boldly say,
that others of richer metall, and finer making, more worth, and less
weight, are daily worn by <HI>Peters</HI> pretended successour.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. <HI>Pilates Palace</HI> must not be forgotten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The palace of <HI>Pilate.</HI></NOTE> wherein our <HI>Saviour</HI> was

<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Joh. 19. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Gabbatha,</HI> or the <HI>Pavement.</HI> But how even, or smooth soever the stones
were laid in the floor thereof; most rough, harsh, and unequall justice

these Princely Palaces were not extant in this City at the same time, but
successively: and therefore as Poets, when they present Persons, who
lived in severall ages, on the same stage, lay their scene in the <HI>Elysian fields;</HI>
so to put these Palaces together, the reader must suppose their dust and

which would hold six hundred men) wherein he observed the motions

Time was when God himself watched over the Temple to protect it,

Sick <HI>Herod the great</HI> perceiving his end to approach, and knowing the

<HI>Crown of Thornes,</HI> painfull to him, and profitable to no other, was, (for

shame more painfull unto him: the exquisiteness of his bodily temper,
increasing the exquisiteness of his torment, and the ingenuity of his

In the first oblation was given what they had suddainly gotten by their
valour, in the latter, what they had leasurely advanced by their diligence.
In the first their own, but taken from their enemies; in the latter their

<P>&sect; 4. Come we now to examine how much a <HI>Talent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The value of a Jewish talent.</NOTE> in Hebrew
<HI>Chichar,</HI> did contain. Whereof in Scripture we finde these generalls.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 One man could not conveniently carry two Talents, and there|fore
<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2 King. 5. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Naaman bound two Talents of silver in two bags, and laid them upon
two of his servants.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 One man might easily beare one Talent, not onely on his back,
but on his head, and that not as a burden, but ponderous or|nament.
Thus the Crown of the King of <HI>Ammon,</HI> afterwards
worn by <HI>David,</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 12. 30.</NOTE> weighed a Talent, besides precious stones. Ex|cept
any will say, that the heaviness thereof rested more on the
subjects hands, then on the Soveraigns head, who by <HI>grand|sergeantry</HI>
ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> be presumed to support the same.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ontained more then ten thousand <HI>Adarconim,</HI> (or
<HI>drams,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">r translations render it) because in the<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 29. 7.</NOTE> aforesaid
text, after entire talents were reckoned up, these <HI>drams</HI> follow as
a fraction or broken sum, not amounting to a whole talent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 The particular value thereof may be collected out of<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Exod. 38. 26. demonstrated by <HI>Brerewood d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> num. Iud. c. 4</HI></NOTE> <HI>Exodus,</HI>
that every talent contained three thousand <HI>shekels,</HI> or fifteen hun|dred
ounces, which in gold according to three pound the ounce,
amounteth to four thousand five hundred pound of English
money.</ITEM>
</LIST>
According to this standard the hundred thousand talents of gold given
by <HI>David</HI> in the first oblation, make up four hundred and fifty millions,
as an excellent<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Idem ca. 5.</NOTE> Critick hath accounted it.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Here as that infidell Prince conceived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Talent some|times taken for a smaller sum.</NOTE> if<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">2 King. 7. 19.</NOTE> windows were made
in heaven, such plenty of food could not follow in <HI>Samaria</HI> as the Prophet
foretold; so more will be of the minde, that if <HI>Pluto</HI> should let open all
his trap-doors, melt all his mines into money, so great a sum could not
suddainly be advanced. This hath given the ground to their probable
opinion, who conceive that <HI>Talent</HI> in the first oblation of <HI>David</HI> is there
taken onely for a plain or flat plate of gold of small value,(as anciently
<PB N="357" REF="193">
in<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Iliad. lib. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI> it passeth in the same acception) whilest in the second offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing
Talent is used in the exact and strict notion, according to the full value
aforesaid, whose judgement is strengthened by the following argu|ments.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Surely <HI>Solomon</HI> was the<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 10. 23.</NOTE> richest of all the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> before or
after him, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> verily I say unto you, that <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his wealth
and trienniall returns from <HI>Tarshish,</HI> was far inferiour to <HI>David,</HI>
if the Talents there mentioned were full and entire according to
the first computation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 What is said of our Saviours deeds by way of hyperbole, that
<HI>if they</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Joh. 21. 25.</NOTE> <HI>were all written, the world it self could not contain the books that
should be written,</HI> may be literally affirmed of <HI>Davids</HI> treasure in the
first oblation. For as the silver there mentioned was tenfold
more then the gold; so if it be allowed (what in moderate pro|por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ion
cannot be denied) that the unweighed <HI>Brass</HI> was ten|fold
to the <HI>Silver,</HI> and the <HI>Iron</HI> to the <HI>Brass,</HI> the whole content of
the<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Ludovi|cus de Aleaser de mensuris sacris.</NOTE> Temple was not sufficient to comprehend so mighty a
mass.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Though the second offering of <HI>David</HI> was far short of the first in
number of Talents, yet it is beheld in Scripture as most solemn
and of highest importance. At the presenting whereof greatest
gratitude to God, and mutuall exultation amongst men was
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 29. 9.</NOTE> expressed. This insinuates that at this rere-account, the <HI>Talents</HI>
were <HI>Talents</HI> indeed, and though in number fewer, in worth
more considerable then the former.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Wherefore though we conceive not the long life of the Patriarchs a
sufficient cause (as some doe) to expound their age of lunary years, yet
the strength of these reasons carry our beliefe along with them to con|tract
the accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of talents in the first account, as is above stated.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. But to close up all concerning <HI>Talents:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A talent after|wards a vast sum.</NOTE> It was so great a sum, that
though now so many thousands of them abounded in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> yet af|ter wards in the reign of <HI>Iehojakim,</HI> one talent of gold and an hundred
talents of silver, was found and felt an heavy annuall taxation for the
whole City of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and kingdome of <HI>Iudah</HI> to pay. Insomuch, <HI>that
he</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 King. 23. 35.</NOTE> <HI>exacted it of every one in the land,</HI> to make up that sum for the King of

Altar was the first thing erected in the Temple, though for the present
made of such mean matter as that hasty occasion would give leave. Here
it stood many years after, even untill the brazen Altar of a firmer Fa|brick
was substituted in the room thereof. Either to this did <HI>Ioab</HI> fly,
and caught hold in vain of the horns thereof, (three years before the
Temple was built) or else to some other Altar near the Tabernacle in

First, because he had been <HI>a</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 3. &amp; 1 Chr. 22. 8.</NOTE> <HI>man of war;</HI> and his martiall reign incum|bred

<PB N="360" REF="195">
not that <HI>Solomon</HI> also <HI>was a man of bloud,</HI> having ordered the executions of

had cured the wound in his conscience, yet God suffered the
scare in his credit so far to remain, as to render him uncanonicall, or
irregular for such an imployment. However, in some sense <HI>David</HI> may

<P>&sect; 1. NOw <HI>Solomon</HI> his son being a peaceable Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Halcyon days of <HI>Solo|mon.</HI></NOTE> as his name
imports, in his quiet reign began the building of the Tem|ple.
Thus as Cryers make an <HI>Oyes</HI> to silence all noise, that
men may the better attend to the Judge when beginning his Charge; so
by a generall peace, <HI>the rage of all people was stilled,</HI> before God in the Oracle
did begin his familiar discourse with the <HI>Israelites,</HI> or the foundation of
the Temple taken in hand. Then <HI>Solomon</HI> enters on the work, employ|ing
in mount <HI>Lebanon,</HI> a vast army of workmen, in their severall distan|ces
to advance this Fabrick.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The multitude of workmen.</NOTE> for servile work, an<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 5. 15. &amp; 2 Chr. 2. 18.</NOTE> hundred and fifty thousand
bearers of burdens, and hewers of stone and wood. All these were
strangers, <HI>Solomon</HI> reserving his native subjects for their purses to pay
taxes, not persons to bear burdens. Secondly, for plain work; in which
thirty thousand <HI>Israelites</HI> were imployed, yet with such<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 King. 5. 14.</NOTE> alternation, that,
divided in three parts, they stayed one moneth in mount <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and
the other two at home. Thirdly, for carved-works; herein the <HI>Sidonians</HI>
onely were used, whose exact number is not specified: But they must
needs be numerous, if we may guess the men by their mouthes, and
their mouthes by the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">2 Chr 2. 10.</NOTE> proportion of victualls allowed them. Lastly,
above all for direction three thousand three hundred were appointed
(surely so many officers would suffer no drones to be in the whole
hive) to oversee the rest.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. Such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two invincible gulfes to swal|low mens la|bours.</NOTE> who admire how so many could so long be busied in
such a building, would haply have wondred more, how so few in so
short a time could have finished the same, had they beheld the magni|ficence

up the labours of many thousands of men. First, the want of
horses in <HI>Iudea</HI> (plenty whereof were brought out of <HI>Egypt</HI> towards the
latter end of King <HI>Solomons</HI> reign) whereupon massie timber in those
mountainous countreys, were managed by the main strength of men.
<PB N="361" REF="195">
The second was a religious Criticisme peculiar to this structure, all
things being beforehand so framed and fitted in mount <HI>Lebanon,</HI> that
<HI>not so much as the sound of an Axe, or Hammer was heard in Ierusalem, when it
came to be erected.</HI> Which exactness must needs occasion many charge|able
essayes and samples, before it could be attained. Nor wanted there
a mystery therein, because as the moving Tabernacle typified the <HI>Church
Militant;</HI> so the Temple resembled the <HI>Triumphant,</HI> where those who
shall be thought worthy to be admitted into glory, shall have nothing
to doe, but to be admitted into glory.</P>

or mallets cased with some soft matter, to bribe them to silence,
yet they could not be made so mute, but that the very contusion and en|forcement
of the aire, would unavoidably advance some sound. Nor
were the beams of the Temple so far in love with their mortises, as to
run into them, or the mortises so fond of the beams, as to embrace them
of their own accord.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. In answer hereto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severall an|swers thereun|to.</NOTE> some plead miracle, others exquisite Art, and
several kindes of cementing, souldering, rivetting, screwing, glewing, and

will account it improbable in it self, and unproportionable to Scripture.
Others distinguish on the degrees of the noise; small in comparison of
so great a work, and not obstreperous to a publick disturbance. But the
best interpret it, that no laborious sound was heard from the hewing or
squaring of timber, or stone, but onely a more cheerfull, yea melodi|ous
harmony, from the happy conjunction, and compacting of parts to|gether,
now easily matched, which had been contracted before. This I am
sure, that what tongue-tied tools soever, were used at the erecting of the
Temple, too clamorous instruments were imployed at the destruction
therof, <HI>when they brake down the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Psal. 74. 6.</NOTE> curved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 6. Besides the two gulfes aforesaid,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solomon</HI> con|sulteth not with thri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</NOTE> (the quick-sands of many
mens labours) it is also to be considered, that though so wise a King as
<HI>Solomon&punc;</HI> would not burden himself with superfluous numbers, yet in this
Fabrick, wherein he did personate and represent the great God of hea|ven,
he consulted more with his magnificence, then his frugality, not
minding so much how many the building in bare necessity did require,
but how many the builders with full authority could command.</P>

seven years was this Temple in building. Here some will behold the

Scripture, whilest we conceive this the best reason, why just seven years
<PB N="362" REF="196">
were spent in the building thereof, because it could not be ended in six,
nor accomplished within a shorter compass of time. Indeed almost
twice as much time (thirteen years) did <HI>Solomon</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 1.</NOTE> spend in building his
own house: whereof this fair and ingenuous reason is rendered by
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ant. Iud. li. 8. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus; because he was not so intent and earnest therein, as in the structure of

how much mens might is impaired, and falls short of the per|formances

<P>&sect; 4. But thus allowing the Temple to be sixty great Cubits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection; Temple a <HI>z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ar</HI> or <HI>little one.</HI></NOTE> or as
many yards, or ninescore feet, long; twenty great Cubits, or yards, or
sixty foot, broad; thirty great Cubits, or yards, or ninety foot, high; (all
clearly within the house, besides the breadth of the wal without) yet some
wil say it answered not expectation, and the stately character given therof
in Scripture. Is this that Fabrick which filled the whole world with the
fame thereof, which was so small in it self considered? Nothing can be
<HI>magnificum,</HI> which is not <HI>magnum,</HI> and it must first be <HI>great,</HI> before it can

give in their dimensions) it would appear as Saint <HI>Gregories</HI> to
Saint <HI>Pauls,</HI> (the babe by the mothers side) or rather this <HI>Davids</HI> modell

<P>&sect; 5. To which we answer. 1^t. The state of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple did
<PB N="364" REF="197">
principally consist not so much in the greatness, as exquisite symmetry
thereof, and costly furniture therein. 2. It was abundantly big enough
for the use for which it was intended, namely to contain the holy ves|sells
(with sufficient, yea with large space betwixt them) and to receive
such Priests as did officiate therein. For the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> was accessible
to the high-Priest alone, and that but once a year, and into the <HI>Holy</HI> or <HI>in|ward
house</HI> came not all the many thousands of <HI>Levites,</HI> but onely such
Priests (to light lampes, set shew-bread, offer incense) as by <HI>Lot</HI> and
<HI>course</HI> were called thereunto, as appeareth by <HI>Zacharies</HI> sole staying there|in,
whilest <HI>the whole</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Luk. 1. 10.</NOTE> <HI>multitude of the people were praying without.</HI> Indeed no|thing
of drudgery was done in the Temple, or what must require many
men to manage it, it being neither handsome nor healthfull to croud
much company into a covered room in that hot Countrey. Lastly, the
great latitude and capacity of the Temple consisted in the outward
Courts, unseparable parts thereof of such receipt, as to entertain multi|tudes
of men <HI>sub dio,</HI> in the open aire, as compleating a square of five
hundred cubits, and in the amplitude, largeness and magnificence there|of,
equalling, yea exceeding the greatest buildings in the world, if report
be but reduced to the standard of truth, and travellers not permitted to
<HI>slip their thumb</HI> in their measuring of yards, overlashing in their relations.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. To return to what properly is termed Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temple bigger then Taber|nacle, and why.</NOTE> the <HI>Tectum,</HI> or
covered part thereof. It was more then twice as great as the Tabernacle
made by <HI>Moses,</HI> which (as<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">De templi fabrica. l. 1. c. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Ribera</HI> collects from the length of the cur|tains
<HI>Exod.</HI> 26.) was but thirty Cubits in length, ten in breadth, and as
many in height. Yea, well might the Temple exceed the Tabernacle in
dimensions, if we consider; First, the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> was erected by exiles
wandering in a barren wilderness; the <HI>Temple</HI> by a potent Prince, and
his populous subjects in their own peaceable countrey. Secondly, the
<HI>Tabernacle</HI> was in a manner fitted for its foundation, to the backs and
shoulders of the <HI>Levites,</HI> which were to carry it, and therefore might
not exceed a portable proportion. Thirdly, the <HI>Temple</HI> mystically ty|pified
the Church Triumphant, and therefore in strength, state, grace,
and greatness was to surpass the Tabernacle, the moveable Emblem of
the Church Militant.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Now how the structure of the Temple stood in relation to the
four quarters of the world, is not plainly expressed in Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple stood East and West.</NOTE> but may
partly be collected from the phrase used in the originall, where the
porch is said to be set <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>before</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 King 6. 3.</NOTE> <HI>the face of the house,</HI> where <HI>Before</HI>
is <HI>Eastward</HI> in the propriety of the Hebrew tongue. Hence all expositors,
Jewish and Christian, confidently place the ends or length of the
Temple East and West, the sides or breadth thereof North and South,
making the porch or entrance on the East end, the inward house in the
middle, and the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> in the West end of the Temple, which se|verall
parts we come now orderly to describe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the fair Porch at the entrance of the Temple.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. THe Porch, in Latine <HI>porticus, &amp; vestibulum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dimensi|ons of the porch.</NOTE> in Hebrew <HI>Ulam,</HI>
(which name the <HI>Septuagint</HI> retain) gave a stately entertainment
to such as entered into the Temple. In the <HI>book of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6. 3.</NOTE> Kings</HI> we
meet with the length, and breadth thereof, but no height there menti|oned:
In<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 3. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Chronicles</HI> we finde the length and height of it, whilest there the
breadth is omitted; by putting both together we may spell the perfect
dimensions thereof. Thus, those who hope for exact intelligence from
heaven, must peruse, and compare all expresses dispatched thence. Yea, in
the new Testament, Gods message is whole, but not wholly by one mes|senger,
so that, what is wanting in one, is supplied in another Evange|list.
This Porch was twenty Cubits in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The flying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oll. <HI>Zach.</HI> 5. 2. was just ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|quate to this porch, in length and breadth <HI>twenty Cubits long and ten borad.</HI></NOTE> length (according to the breadth
of the house) ten in breadth, and an hundred<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 3. 4.</NOTE> &amp; twenty in height, moun|ting
tower-like above the rest, being four times as high, as the body of
the Temple.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Some will say with covetous <HI>Iudas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Such a tower not useless.</NOTE> <HI>To</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 26. 8. &amp; Ioh. 12. 4.</NOTE> <HI>what purpose was this wast?</HI>
seeing the inside thereof was but an useless vacuity, not having any bells
therein (trumpets being the onely bells of the Hebrews to summon
their assemblies) and that otherwise it was for no service. But know,
that is not empty, which is full of ornament; nor idle, which stands
both for strength, and state. If an elegant <HI>exordium</HI> be so usefull in an
oration, to gain the ears of the Auditors; no less gracefull a fair front
in a building, to win the eyes of the beholders. Nor was <HI>Solomon</HI> minded
like many in after-ages, who cut down all top-masts from the ship of
Christs Church (politickly pretending a tempest, and that all is done
for her safety) and make her close notted to the very keel; but, his large
hart and hand, cared not what he expended on the magnificence of Gods
House.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. Here I cannot but admire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple not so high as the Porch.</NOTE> to see legions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Reckoned up by <HI>Ribera de Templo. li 1. c. 2.</HI> with whom he seemethto con|cur.</NOTE> of learned men, ex|tend
and cary on the aforesaid height, of an hundred and twenty Cubits
(appropriated in the text to the porch alone) even to the whole fabrick
of the Temple, making the entire body thereof of an uniform height,
equall with the porch. Where, to excuse them from inconveniences,
they make the lower Temple to reach to the first loft, roof, or seeling of
Cedar, over which they fancy an upper house of equall propor|tion,
the roof whereof ranged even with the porch in height; so ma|king
a <HI>Duplicate,</HI> or all the rooms of the Temple to be double, one on
the floor, the other in the upper story. Indeed we read in <HI>Solomons</HI> song
of a sort of sheep<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cant. 4. 2.</NOTE> <HI>whereof every one bare twins,</HI> but that such gemination
was here in the Temple, is altogether improbable, Scripture being silent
<PB N="366" REF="198">
of that second, or upper story, nor mentioning any use, for which it
was intended, and confining the height of the Temple to just thirty
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 King 6. 2.</NOTE> Cubits. Well therefore may we suspect some flaw, or crack in those
spectacles, which represent the Temple thus double, against the simpli|city
of the text, to the unprejudiced readers thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. To return to the porch;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bede</HI> his con|ceit.</NOTE> fair (no doubt) was the door or gate
leading thereinto, though very bold is the assertion of <HI>venerable Bede,</HI>
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">In lib. qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st. in lib. Regum quaest. 12.</NOTE> affirming that it was so great, that, <HI>standing full east, the equinoctiall Sun
without any obstacle, did send his beams through the door of the Temple, and Oracle,
into the very Ark which was within the Holy of Holies.</HI> But, grant the gate ve|ry
great in the porch, surely the sun-shine could not penetrate so far, be|ing
intercepted by the partition. It being improbable, that the door of
the Oracle was ever left open, that mysterious place being unenterable,
as well for the eyes, as feet of any, save the high-Priest alone. Otherwise,
needless was the renting of the <HI>vail</HI> at our Saviours passion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. 45.</NOTE> if the passage
into the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> was pervious at all times, or if the gate thereof did
usually stand open.</P>
<P>&sect; 5.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The porch how overlaid with gold.</NOTE> This porch (as the words lay plain in the text) <HI>Solomon<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 3. 4.</NOTE> overlaid

next in position to the porch) rather to reach over in their relation, to
other more inward parts of the Temple, conceiving it too vast and
needless an expence, to overlay a tower six score Cubits high within
with gold. But, ill fare <HI>covetous Commentatours</HI> on a <HI>liberall text.
Solomon</HI> will give them small thanks for their great thrift; to spare his
cost, and at once to spoile both the letter of the text, and the lustre of his
Temple. We conclude it overlaid with pure gold, that is, gilded all over,
but being silver within; so reconciling it to another place, where <HI>Da|vid</HI>
is said to have provided<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 29. 4.</NOTE> <HI>seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the houses withall.</HI> Thus it took the denomination of gold, from
that metall which was most precious, and most visible on the surface
thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Let none here condemn me, for grudging the Temple her glory,
thus debasing the gold thereof into silver-gilt. For mine own part, as
<HI>Moses</HI> wished <HI>all Gods people<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Num. 11. 29.</NOTE> Prophets;</HI> it would not offend me, if all
Gods House were <HI>pearles,</HI> mine eyes are not so bleared with envy, as to
smart at the shining of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple. But a due decorum must be
observed in this edifice, and one place of Scripture must not be advan|ced,
to depress another. And, seeing there were degrees in holiness,
why not also gradations in gallantry, between the severall rooms of the
Temple? So that all three might be overlaid with <HI>pure gold;</HI> the <HI>porch</HI>
with leafe, the <HI>inward house</HI> with plate, the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> with the most
refined gold of <HI>Parvaim.</HI></P>

gems and jewels thereby; for, the burying of such shining
beauties under ground, what had it been else, but the <HI>putting of a candle

<HI>Rabbi Iehuda</HI> an ancient writer (whose judgement <HI>Tremellius</HI> pre|ferreth
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Vid. annot. in 1 King 6. 4.</NOTE> above all others) conceiveth them of <HI>glass,</HI> plenty whereof we
have observed nigh <HI>Sidon,</HI> in purity corrivall with Crystall it self. But
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">On Ezek. 41.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> will have them <HI>lattised, Lignis interrasilibus, &amp; vermiculatis,</HI>
with <HI>worming or winding splinters of shaved wood:</HI> in which notion the Sep|tuagint
renders them <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>windows of net work.</HI> If so, we will
be bold to conceive such wooden lathes were overlaid with gold, other|wise
it was unsuitable, that when no wood appeared on the walls, it
should presume to peep out in the windows. Sure I am, in the second
Temple (inferiour to this in magnificence) <HI>Iosephus</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">De bello Iud. lib. 7. cap. 10.</NOTE> reports, how a
Roman soldier set fire on a <HI>golden</HI> window. However, if one will main|tain,
that these windows, made as much to let in aire, as light, and (per|chance)
more to let out smoak then either (caused by the constant lamps
and perfumes) were open without any shutting at all, I see no coercive
argument, to enforce his beliefe to the contrary, can be taken out of
Scripture. Now because the Temple was compassed about with three
stories of chambers, each of them, five, and all three, fifteen Cubits high,
these windows in the Temple must be made above the roof of those
chambers, where their high standing afforded a double benefit, both of
clearer light, and greater privacy.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. The roof of the Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The roof and covering there|of.</NOTE> finding no exception to the contrary,
probably was flat, built like other houses in <HI>Iudea,</HI> where men might

if any aske, with what metall it was covered? I am not ashamed to pro|fess
my ignorance. A quere, which, by his own confession,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">In Ezek. tom. 2. par. 2. cap. 40.</NOTE> posed
<HI>Villalpandus,</HI> propounded unto him by <HI>Isabella</HI> Archduchess of <HI>Austria,</HI>
even after he had studied the subject many years, and accounted himself
question-proof in all particulars. Insomuch, that <HI>non-plussed</HI> hereat, he
was fain afresh to betake himself to his book, and on second enquiries
found out of <HI>Eupolemus,</HI> and other Authors (Scripture being silent there|in)
that it was covered with tiles of brass (no more contradiction, then
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 King. 22. 11.</NOTE> <HI>hornes of Iron</HI> mentioned in Scripture) which, <HI>squammato opere,</HI> in <HI>scale|work,</HI>
lay one over another. A thing not unlikely in it self, <HI>David</HI> having
provided brass in such abundance, that it was<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 22. 14.</NOTE> <HI>without weight.</HI> No won|der,

I dare negatively affirme, it was not covered with lead, being so drossie

either they were rivetted into holes fore-prepared of purpose, or
else they were stifned with some mixture of silver, or copper, not for
cheapness, but the greater usefulness thereof. Be it here once for all ob|served,
that, where the Utensils of the Temple, are termed of pure gold,
understand it so pure, as the end, for which they were intended, would
permit. Otherwise some necessary allay of baser metall made them not

then put himself to the pain, and expence of a new one? Let
them know, that the former vaile fitted for the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> in the
Tabernacle, was too short and narrow, yea, half in half too little for this
purpose. Therefore, it not being princely to piece, patch, or eek the

suitable to so stately a fabrick, wherein (as the Apostle in another case)

<P>&sect; 8. One difficulty remains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Holy of Holies was in the midst of the Temple.</NOTE> where this <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> was placed, be|cause
the text<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6. 19.</NOTE> saith <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>he prepared it, in medio domus, in the midst of the

it, and that the Oracle, like the center, was surrounded with the
circumference of the Temple: But on stricter enquiry, it will be found
onely a pure Hebraism, &amp; that <HI>in the midst</HI> signifieth the same with <HI>within,</HI>
as it is judiciously rendered in our translation. Thus saith <HI>David,</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 101. 7.</NOTE> <HI>He that

<P>&sect; 1. ALthough it be repeated thrice in one<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6 5.</NOTE> verse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chambers how round about.</NOTE> that chambers were
built <HI>round about,</HI> yet because in the same place, mention onely

<PB N="373" REF="201">
the east end where the Porch stood, was clear, and un-chambered, having
no other buildings about it, to hinder the prospect thereof. Nor, let
any be moved, because that the chambers are said to be built <GAP DESC="foreign"><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>upon
the wall,</HI> as if they were founded on the wall of the temple, <HI>supra</HI> being
there taken for <HI>juxta,</HI> or <HI>contra, upon;</HI> or <HI>hard by,</HI> or <HI>over against,</HI> as our trans|lation

we sat down and wept,</HI> that is, <HI>by the waters;</HI> as these chambers were built
hard by, or leaning to the wall of the Temple.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Three rows there were of these chambers. In the lowest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dimen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ions.</NOTE> each
chamber<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6. 6.</NOTE> was five; in the middle, six; in the third, and highest story,
seven cubits broad; and each of them equally<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">lbid. ver. 10.</NOTE> five cubits in height, go|ing
up from the first to the middle, thence to the highest story with <HI>win|ding
staires.</HI> The beams of these chambers did not lye in, but<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6. 6.</NOTE> rest on the
wall of the Temple, the reduction or abatement whereof, narrowing
in, the higher it went, afforded fit stays for that purpose. It seems, the
beams were not mortised into the walls of the Temple, because the in|tireness
of that building was not to be wounded with holes, and per|forations,
which in process of time might fret in, and indent into the
structure it self. Speciall care therefore was taken, to preserve the whole|ness
and prevent all fractions in this fabrick, in some relation to the
Temple of Christs body, whereof <HI>a bone was not to be broken.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. It is not expressed in Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vessels of the Tabernacle kept in these chambers.</NOTE> for what use these chambers were
principally intended. Some conceive them designed for galleries, or
walking-places; which to me seems too much presumption, for any to
take their pleasure so near the holy place. Others will have them used
for Dormitories, for such Priests to lodge in, who were in ordinary at|tendance
about the Temple. For my own part, I conceive them imploy|ed
for Repositories, wherein the holy vestments, and vessels were safely
laid up, together with those of the Tabernacle, which (though not used)
were here carefully preserved. For, first, the vessels of <HI>Moses</HI> his making
were not aliened, or diverted to any profane service; such sacriledge be|ing
unsupposable in that age. Secondly, they were not altered, or melted
by <HI>Solomon</HI> (of moe and lesser, so to make fewer, and greater Utensils for
the Temple) because, the making, as well as the matter; the shape, as
well as the substance of all the Tabernacle-vessels were of <HI>livine institution.</HI>
Thirdly, they were not imployed in Gods service, because (some few
excepted, whereof hereafter) being calculated for the <HI>Meridian</HI> of the Ta|bernacle
a less fabrick, thus fel out to be too short, and smal in proportion
to the Temple, as in the Vail was formerly observed. Seeing therfore they
were neither aliened, altered, nor used, it remaineth they were carefully
kept in these chambers, intimated in the text,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 5. 5.</NOTE> where after the finishing
of the Temple, the <HI>Levites</HI> are said to bring up into it, <HI>all the vessels of the Ta|bernacle.</HI>
Thus graces acquired or infused into a Christian in this life, are
not lost, forfeited, or cast away after death; but, preserved&punc; perfected, and
swallowed up in glory.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="202">
&sect; 4. As for the mysticall meaning of these chambers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fancy runs riot when spurred with supersti|tion.</NOTE> <HI>Bede,</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Lib. 7^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> no doubt,
thought he hit the very mark, when finding therein the three conditi|ons
of life all belonging to Gods Church. In the ground-chamber, such
as live in mariage; in the middle-chamber, such as contain; but, in the
<HI>excelsis</HI> or third-story, such as have attained to the sublimity of perpe|tuall
virginity. <HI>Rupertus,</HI> in the lowest chamber, lodgeth those of practi|call
lives with <HI>Noah;</HI> in the middle, those of mixt lives with <HI>Iob;</HI> and in the
highest, such as spend their days with <HI>Daniel</HI> in holy speculations. But is
not this rather <HI>lusus,</HI> then <HI>allusio,</HI> sporting with, then expounding of Scrip|tures?
Thus when the gates of the Oracle are made<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6. 31</NOTE> <HI>five-square, Ribera</HI>
therein reads our conquest over the five senses; and when those of the
door of the Temple are said to be <HI>four-square,</HI> therein saith he is denoted
the <HI>quaternion</HI> of Evangelists. After this rate, <HI>Hiram</HI> (though, no doubt,
dexterous in his art) could not so soon fit a pillar with a fashion, as a
Frier can fit that fashion with a mystery. If made three-square, then the
Trinity of Persons; four-square, the cardinall vertues; five-square, the
<HI>Pentateuch</HI> of <HI>Moses;</HI> six-square, the <HI>Petitions</HI> in the <HI>Lords prayer;</HI> seven-square,
their <HI>Sacraments;</HI> eight-square, the <HI>Beatitudes;</HI> nine-square, the
orders of Angels; ten-square, the Commandements; eleven-square the
morall vertues; twelve-square, the articles of the Creed are therein con|tained.
In a word, for matter of numbers, fancy is never at a loss, like a
begger never out of his way, but hath some haunts where to repose it
self. But, such as in expounding of Scripture reap more then God did
sow there, never eat what they reap thence, because such grainless huskes,
when seriously threshed out, vanish all into chaffe.</P>

Fathers, and learned mens conjectures. We thought it unfit, to con|found
these together in the same character, being so distanced in their
own natures. The Apostle Saint <HI>Paul</HI> varies his phrase, when delivering
his prudentiall advises, from his style, when enjoyning, what he had
from divine inspiration. In the former, <HI>To the rest</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7. 12.</NOTE> <HI>speak I, not the Lord:</HI> In

<P>&sect; 1. _SO much for the Diamond it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of the present subject, with the causesthere|of.</NOTE> <HI>the covered Tem|ple,</HI>
come we now to the Ring wherein it was
set, the Courts which encompassed it. Herein
we meet with much difficulty, arising partly
from Gods silence, (speaking little in Scripture of
the present subject) partly from mansloquacity,
whose fancies without warrant from the word,
are as copious as different in describing the Courts of this Temple. But,
that which makes the matter in hand more intricate is, because learned
men confound <HI>Temples</HI> and <HI>Times,</HI> ascribing those Courts to <HI>Solomons,</HI>
which onely belonged to the second Temple, at, and after the time of
our Saviour. Thus, as countrey painters make the <HI>nine Worthies</HI> (not ac|cording
to the garb of those ancient ages wherein they lived) with bands
and cuffs according to our modern fashion; so some Jewish writers
<HI>(Iosephus</HI> himself being not wholly free from this fault) shape the Courts
of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, not after their true form in the old Testament; but
as the second Temple adorned by <HI>Herod,</HI> stood modelled in their own
days.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. We read of <HI>Iacob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ill consequen|ces of confoun|ding the two Temples.</NOTE> that he set his own sheep three days<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 30. 36.</NOTE> journey
from the flocks of <HI>Laban</HI> his father-in-law, so sufficiently to distinguish
their severall stocks from making quarrels by meeting together. A
greater distance divides the two Temples, there being no less then seven|ty
years, betwixt the destruction of the one, and erection of the other.
Enough in probability to prevent all mistakes, which might arise from
<PB N="380" REF="205">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">udling them together. I wonder therefore the more at their marvellous
agility, who so easily can leap over this <HI>great-gulfe</HI> of time, &amp; who by con|founding
the two Temples, and making many things common to both,
of two perfect models, compose one no better then a monster. That we
run not on the same rocks, we will carefully observe their severall pro|perties,
insisting onely on such things for the present, as were peculiar to
<HI>Solomons</HI> fabrick, confining our selves to Scripture instructions: as
knowing that the judicious palat will prefer a drop of the <HI>sincere milk of

no warrant out of the word for such an assertion.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Probably certain ascents led hither out of the outward Court,
and hence into the Temple. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">grees in this Court.</NOTE> besides the frequent phrase <HI>of going up
into Gods house:</HI> it was proper that the Temple, as in holinesse, so in
height should be distanced above her Courts (as they one above ano|ther,
and both above common ground) were it but to minde such as
approached thither, with the mounting of their bodies to elevate their
hearts in devotion. But, how many these stairs or steps were, is uncer|tain,
though some will have them fifteen, according to the number of
the <HI>Psalmes of Degrees,</HI> sung, as they affirm, by the Priests in their ascent
to the Temple.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the great, or outward Court.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. WHereas <HI>Solomon</HI> is said to have made the <HI>Inner Court of the
House of the Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The severall names of this Court.</NOTE> by the rule of relation, an outward
Court is thence next inferred. But to clear it more, ex|press
mention is made thereof 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. 9. where, besides the <HI>Court of
Priests,</HI> he is said to have made <HI>the great Court, and doors for the Court, and
overlaid the doors of them with brass.</HI> This Court in Hebrew is called <HI>Aza|rah</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 4. 9.</NOTE>, rendered by <HI>Montanus atrium auxilii,</HI> from <HI>Azar to help,</HI> because God
there answered his peoples prayer by his <HI>gracious assistance</HI> afforded unto
them.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Well might this be termed the <HI>great Court,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certainly large, how large un|certain.</NOTE> seeing large (though
uncertain) were the dimensions thereof, an hundred Cubits square at
the least. But what was this to contain all <HI>Israel</HI> therein? <HI>Philip</HI> speaking
of five thousand to be fed, <HI>Two</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Iohn 6. 7.</NOTE> <HI>hundred penny worth of bread</HI> (saith he) <HI>is
not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.</HI> But, grant this Court two
hundred Cubits square (more then the place will allow) this would
afford but few inches for a mans body to stand in, except the ground
was here (as the loaves) miraculously multiplyed. We therefore con|ceive,
that the people of the land were successively admitted to this place,
otherwise impossible to contain them. Ascents, or staires did also lead
into this Court, but how many is not known; surely they were low
and little, short and easie, to be climbed up, otherwise the cattell brought
thither to be sacrificed, could not conveniently clamber over them.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. This Court was by successive Kings (especially <HI>Hezekiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Court bettered by suc|ceeding Kings.</NOTE> who
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">2 King. 18. 16.</NOTE> cased the pillars thereof with silver) improved to more beauty, then it
had in the days of <HI>Solomon.</HI> Some will say, this was a disparagement to
the perfection of <HI>Solomons</HI> work, as if he had left any defects, or defaults
therein, to be amended by others. Were not his structures, as his disco|veries,
compleat? for,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 2. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Who is he that will come after the King in things?</HI> It
is answered, the outward Temple was, in the appendent Courts thereof,
<PB N="382" REF="206">
capable of more cost and expence, to make them both bigger, and bra|ver;
though the covered Temple was <HI>semel &amp; semper, at once and for ever
perfected,</HI> afterwards admitting of no new addition, when <HI>Solomon</HI> had
finished it. Surely God granted not such a Monopoly to <HI>Solomon</HI> alone
to ingross all honour to himself, so that no reserve was left for posterity,
no bottome for their bounty to build on, in after ages, to testifie their
gratitude to Gods goodness. Some accessions therefore might be made
(though not to the vitall parts, as I may say) to the out-lims of the Tem|ple.
It is the priviledge not of the house of God, but of God himself,
to be so perfect, as that nothing can be added unto him.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. But others will object,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">kiah en|cused from in|novation.</NOTE> that this was a presumptuous innovation
in <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> seeing the Courts of the Temple, and all things therein
were framed according to the divine<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 11. 12. 19.</NOTE> pattern <HI>David</HI> left to <HI>Solomon,</HI> for
him to overlay those pillars with silver, which <HI>Solomons</HI> wisdome, fol|lowing
Gods platform, was pleased to make plain. But, let such know,
that he swerveth not at all from the proportion of the Copy, who onely
gilds, or colours the letters therein. <HI>Hezekiah</HI> for the main kept himself
to the former fabrick, not altering, but adorning the same. The worst
was, that afterwards he<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 King. 18. 16.</NOTE> cut off the silver again to purchase the favour
of <HI>Sennacherib.</HI> Better had those pillars been left naked, then thus to be
clothed, and then to be stript of their costly coats. For, though (as some
scornfully may scoff) there was no danger of their catching cold when
thus disrobed; yet the beauty of those pillars were thereby much im|paired,
looking ruggedly when again uncased, besides the inexcusable
sacriledge therein committed, whereof hereafter.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. We must not forget the <HI>entry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Private passage from the Kings house into the Temple.</NOTE> leading from this Court to the
Kings Palace, through which the Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI> had at pleasure a pri|vate
passage into the Temple. This continuation of the Kings to Gods
house, shewed the mutuall intercourse which ought to be betwixt Poli|cy,
and Piety; as also that Princes (besides their set, solemn, and pub|lick
addresses to God by prayer) must have their secret recourses unto
him, in their occasionall devotions. It was first made by King <HI>Solomon,</HI>
and then so stately a structure, that amongst other things, the Queen of
<HI>Sheba</HI> was ravished with admiration at the sight thereof, when she be|held<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 King. 10. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>the ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord.</HI> And yet after|wards
it was made more magnificent, when<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 9. 11.</NOTE> <HI>terrased</HI> on both sides with
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 King. 10. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Pillasters</HI> made of those <HI>Almuggin</HI> trees which she presented to <HI>Solomon;</HI>
which, if oderiferous, (as some will have it) made that passage as sweet to
the smell, as specious to the sight. Wicked <HI>Ahaz</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2. King. 16. 18.</NOTE> turned this <HI>entry</HI> from
the house of the Lord, <HI>for the King of Assyria,</HI> that is, as<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Vide ejus an|not. in locum.</NOTE> <HI>Tremellius</HI>
will have it, stopped up, or diverted that passage, fearing, lest through
it the King of <HI>Assyria</HI> should out of the Temple suddenly surprise the
Kings palace. I conceive this done not for fear, but in favour of the
<HI>Assyrian</HI> King, <HI>Ahaz</HI> hereby cutting off all connexion, and dependence
<PB N="383" REF="206">
of his Palace to the Temple, and utterly renouncing all relation to true
Religion, so the more to confirme this friendship with that heathen
King, begun on a new account, and grounded on pure principles of
Idolatry. At the same time he turned out also <HI>the</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 16. 18.</NOTE> <HI>covert of the Sabbath</HI>
which they had built in the house, by which our foresaid Authour un|derstands,
a place erected for the shelter of such Priests as officiated on
the Sabbath.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. As for their tradition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Rabbinicall Tradition.</NOTE> who report <HI>Solomon</HI> to have written on the
walls of the Temple, soveraign Receipts against all diseases, which <HI>He|zekiah</HI>
afterwards is said to rase out, because people placed too much con|fidence
therein, to the prejudice of divine providence, I listen to both as
Rabbinicall fables. Surely such medicines (if any there prescribed)
proved uneffectuall to cure <HI>Asa's</HI> gout, <HI>Ioram's</HI> dysentery, <HI>Uzziahs</HI> lepro|sie,
as indeed no art can crave longer time, when death calls for the pre|sent
payment of the debt to nature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Gates and Porters of the Court.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. HEaven hath onely one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four principall gates.</NOTE> and that a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 14.</NOTE> narrow gate leading there|into.
But severall fair gates on all sides, gave entrance into
the Courts of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple. Some of them to us of cer|tain,
others but of conjecturall situation. Of the former were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 <HI>East-gate,</HI> where<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 26. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Shelemiah</HI> was Porter. This gate was set in the
front, leading directly to the Temple, and therefore King <HI>Io|tham</HI>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 15. 35. &amp; 2 Chr. 27. 3. Vide Tremel. in locos.</NOTE> rebuilt it, mounting Monarch-like above the parity of
other ports, that it became higher then all the rest, yet met with
no zelot to humble it, for aspiring above its fellows.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>North-gate,</HI> where<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 26. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Zacharias</HI> his son was Porter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>South-gate,</HI> attended on by the sons of<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 26. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Obed-Edom.</HI> The <HI>house of
Asuppim</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> (rendred by <HI>Hierome</HI> and <HI>Pagnine</HI> a <HI>counsel-house,</HI> by <HI>Tre|mellius
Aerarium,</HI> the <HI>Treasury</HI>) was for conveniency united to
their charge. A place, probably of entrance, certainly of conse|quence,
as needing a constant guard about it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 <HI>West-gate,</HI> where <HI>Shuppim</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 26. 16.</NOTE> and <HI>Hosah</HI> were Porters. To them al|so
belonged the gate <HI>Shallecheth,</HI> by the <HI>causway of the going up,</HI> un|derstand
thereby that stately ascent made by <HI>Solomon,</HI> out of his
own Palace into the Temple.</ITEM>
</LIST>
But besides these four, which respected the cardinall winds, we meet
with other intermediate gates, whose accurate position is uncertain.
Never did the blinded<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Gen. 19. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Sodomites</HI> more groap for <HI>Lots</HI> door in the dark,
then learned men are puzled to finde the gate of<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 King. 11. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Sur,</HI> (elsewhere<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 23. 5.</NOTE> cal|led
<PB N="384" REF="207">
the <HI>foundation-gate</HI>) where at the coronation of King <HI>Ioash,</HI> a tierce of
<HI>Levites</HI> were awarded to waite, by order from <HI>Iehojada. Tremellius</HI> not
improbably conceives it the same with the <HI>East-gate.</HI> As for the <HI>New|gate</HI>
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ier. 26. 10. &amp; 36. 10.</NOTE>, wherein <HI>Baruch</HI> publickly read the book of <HI>Ieremy,</HI> I am confident
it was one of the four principall gates, onely repaired, enlarged, or ad|orned
with new buildings.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 26. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Parbar</HI> seated on the west must not be
forgotten (whether Porters-lodge, Priests-vestry, or place wherein sa|crificing
instruments were laid up) having something of the nature of
a gate therein, because two porters daily attended it. Say not, it was
suspicious, that so small a Court would run out at so many gates, which
surely were no more, then just proportion, and uniformity did re|quire.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. The principall office of Porters was to secure the gates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number and office of the Porters.</NOTE> provi|ding
for the peace and purity of the Temple and service therein. These
in all were<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 23. 5.</NOTE> four thousand, thus daily disposed of; Eastward, six; North|ward,
four; Southward, four; at <HI>Asuppim-gate,</HI> two; and two, West|ward;
at the Causway, four; at <HI>Parbar-gate,</HI> two; four and twenty in
all. An eminent number in Temple-service (so many the singers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 25. 32.</NOTE>, and
the severall<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 24. 18.</NOTE> courses of the Priests) to which the four and twenty Elders
in the<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Revel. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Revelation</HI> have some allusion. Their service was, as well
nocturnall, as by day:<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Psal. 134. 1.</NOTE> <HI>which by night stand in the house of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Here let others dispute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A treble quere concerning the Porters places.</NOTE> whether the Porters places were meerly
ministeriall, (or servile rather) or also partly judiciall, with some ad|missive,
and exclusive power to take cognizance of the cleanness of
such persons as did approach to the Temple. Otherwise, they were
easily qualified for their office, rather bigness then brains commending
men generally to such imployments. Secondly, if they were intrusted
with any such authority, let others enquire, by what means they made
discoveries of peoples uncleanness, finding no oath <HI>Ex officio</HI> they ten|dred
to any to betray themselves, though otherwise some secret polluti|on
might be concealed, the parties themselves being onely privy there|unto.
Lastly, let them discuss, whether these Porters were afterward
advanced to higher places, or onely (as the doors whereon they atten|ded
turned round on their hinges) moved alternately in their own
sphere, without possibility of any farther preferment. If the latter, it is
strange that the worthy parts of <HI>Zachariah his son Porter Northward,</HI> com|mended
in Scripture to be a<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 26. 14.</NOTE> <HI>wise counsellour,</HI> should be imprisoned in so
narrow a profession. And yet his employment (though the meanest
about the Temple) was honourable in it self, if well executed: witness
holy <HI>David</HI> his choice, <HI>I had rather be<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Psal. 84. 10.</NOTE> a door-keeper in the house of my God, then
to dwell in the tabernacles of wickedness.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4. Now notwithstanding all the care of the Porters to the contrary;
some (not going through the gates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intruders into the Temple without the Porters leave.</NOTE> but over the walls) made bold to
lodge and live with their whole families within the verge of the
<PB N="385" REF="207">
Temple. <HI>Yea, the sparrow<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Psal. 84. 3.</NOTE> hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for her self,
where she may lay her young, even thine Altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my
God.</HI> By Altars understand the Courts and buildings about it, otherwise
the Altar it self (fitter for Salamanders then Sparrows) was too hot a
climate for their habitation. Birds, we see, may prescribe an ancient
title to build in our steeples, having time out of minde taken the same
priviledge in the Tabernacle, and Temple. Yea <HI>David</HI> in exile debarred
access to Gods publick service, doth pity his own, and prefer the con|dition
of these fowls before him. And, although no devotion (whereof
they were uncapable) but the bare delight in fair fabricks, brought them
hither; yet, we may presume (according to their kind) they served
God better then many men in that place, chirping forth Morning and
Even-praises to the honour of their maker. To take our farewell of these
Porters, wicked <HI>Ahaz</HI> gave them a <HI>Supersedeas.</HI> from their office, in that
long <HI>Vacation</HI> wherein he<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 28. 24.</NOTE> shut up the doors of the house of the Lord,
so obstructing Gods mercy against himself.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Chambers, and Treasuries about the Court.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. THe Porches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chambers and Treasuries over the Porch.</NOTE> or Cloisters beneath were built with rooms a|bove;
if not round about the Court, certainly over the in|tervalls
of the gates. Such places were employed, partly for
chambers for Priests to lodge in, partly for Treasuries, wherein conse|crated
things were deposited.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Amongst the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chamber of <HI>Gemariah</HI> wherein <HI>Iere|miahs</HI> book was read.</NOTE> most remarkable was the chamber of <HI>Ge|mariah</HI>
the son of <HI>Shaphan</HI> the Secretary, wherein<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ier. 36. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Baruch</HI> read the book
of <HI>Ieremy,</HI> which afterwards was burnt by <HI>Iehojakim</HI> King of <HI>Iudah.</HI>
When though some (dissenters and disswaders) amongst all the Cour|tiers
no mourners appeared at the funeralls of this book, it being ex|pected,
they should have been as cruell to their clothes, to<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Vers. 24.</NOTE> rend them
for sorrow, at the sight of that double martyrdome of that innocent
Volume, first cancelled with a pen-knife to pieces, then afterward
burnt to ashes. But the flame, which did burn the book, did but bur|nish
the truths written therein; Yea another <HI>Phoenix</HI> arose out of

many like words added beside.</HI> Thus wanton children by breaking their

<P>&sect; 3. Next we take notice of the chamber of <HI>Nathan<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">2 King. 23. 11</NOTE> Melech at the en|tring
of the house of the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chamber of</HI> Nathan Melech.</NOTE> by which stood those statues of horses dedi|cated
to the Sun by some Idolatrous Kings of <HI>Iudah,</HI> which <HI>Iosiah</HI> de|stroyed.
<PB N="386" REF="208">
What! was the Sun, which<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Psal. 19. 5.</NOTE> <HI>rejoyceth as a Giant to run his course,</HI>
ever so tyred, as to need hacknies to carry him to his journeys end? Oh
no, but the <HI>Iews</HI> plundred this piece of Idolatry from the <HI>Persians,</HI> who
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Xenophon li. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> offered horses unto the Sun, and<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Fastor. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Ovid</HI> renders some reason thereof,

Now the <HI>Iews</HI> counting it too gross Idolatry to sacrifice naturall horses
to the Sun, erected artificiall ones in honour thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Another eminent chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chamber of the Sons of <HI>Hanan.</HI></NOTE> was that of the <HI>Sons of Hanan,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ier. 35. 4.</NOTE> which
was by the chamber of the Princes,</HI> probably on the one hand, <HI>which was by the
chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum the keeper of the door,</HI> on the other hand
thereof. Here <HI>Ieremy</HI> in vain solicited the <HI>Rechabites</HI> to drink wine, ob|serving
the instructions of their ancestours therein; as also in their con|stant
dwelling<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ier. 35. 10.</NOTE> in tents, so to entertain all turnings of the times, with less
trouble to themselves. Provident birds, onely to perch on the boughs,
not build their nests on that tree, which they suspected would suddenly
be cut down, foreseeing perchance the captivity of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Indeed, in
all fickle times (such as we live in) it is folly to fix on any durable de|sign,
as inconsistent with the uncertainty of our age, and safest to
pitch up <HI>tent-projects,</HI> whose alteration may with less loss, and a clear con|science
comply with the change of the times.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. That Solomon made no moe then two Courts on the east of the Temple.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. ALthough many learned authours make four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No moe then two outward Courts made by <HI>Solomon.</HI></NOTE> and some moe
Courts about <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, yet the following reasons per|swade
me, that these two Courts formerly described by us,
were all which were of <HI>Solomons</HI> originall foundation. Because,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Mention is made of no moe in Scripture, either in the book of
<HI>Kings,</HI> or <HI>Chronicles,</HI> where his buildings are particularly described.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Manasseh</HI> is said to have built Altars for the host of Heaven in the
<HI>two<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 King. 21. 5.</NOTE> Courts</HI> of the house of the Lord. Probably, had there been
any moe, his profaneness would have found them out, no place
being priviledged from his Idolatry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 The narrowness of the place, as it was in <HI>Solomons</HI> time, admit|ted
of no moe Courts, such was the precipice thereof on all sides.</ITEM>
</LIST>
This last is confessed by<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ioseph. de Bel. Iud. lib. 6. ca. 6. Edit. lat. sed graec. cap. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus,</HI> whose words deserve our heeding to
clear the matter in hand; <HI>The Temple was built upon an</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>hard mountain, and
at the first, the plain on the top thereof was scarce sufficient to contain the Temple, and
the Altar, the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> circumference thereof being steep and shelving. But, when King
Solomon who built the Temple, had compassed the east part thereof with a wall, he
<PB N="387" REF="208">
also placed a Porch upon the rampire, and so, many ages after it lay<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> unfenced on the
other parts, untill the people every day bringing earth thither, at last made it plain and
large enough.</HI> Insomuch that the Temple extant in the days of <HI>Iosephus&punc;</HI> had
a threefold wall about it, and other courts built on that forced ground,
which industry had added thereunto. See here the small compass of the
Temples floor at the first founding thereof. So that those who in <HI>Solo|mons</HI>
time make moe Courts about it, must build them in the aire, see|ing
the earth (such then the scantness and steepness thereof) afforded
no bottome for the building of such imaginary fabricks.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. But shrewd objections<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object.</NOTE> are brought to the contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>David</HI> at least prescribed three Courts.</NOTE> by such who,
in <HI>Solomons</HI> time, make moe then two Courts by us described. No doubt
(say they) he observed <HI>Davids</HI> instructions, who by the Spirit gave him
the pattern <HI>of</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 12.</NOTE> <HI>all the Courts of the house of the Lord, which he meant to make.</HI>
These therefore at the least must needs be three, seeing <HI>All</HI> (as<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. de Caelo. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Aristotle</HI>
observes) can not in proper language, be predicated of a lower number.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. Answ. I confess the words so read in the vulgar Latine, <HI>&amp; omnium

<P>&sect; 5. Answ. The same was sufficiently fenced, and severed from the
City with the precipice of the place, barring all access, and the Temple
on that side surrounded with ambient aire in the concavity of the vally.
If besides this, any artificiall wall encompassed the Temple on the west,
the distance between it and the Temple may be counted a passage, but a|mounted

they were mingled with men, seeing the Prophet speaking of a solemn
humiliation, <HI>They shall waile</HI> (saith he) <HI>the family of the house of David apart,

sexes in severall Courts in the <HI>first Temple</HI> hath no foundation in Scrip|ture,
but rather thence the contrary may be collected, that all sexes and
ages promiscuously met together; for, <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> is said, <HI>to have stood in

he was no eye-witness of the first and old Temple (being born five
hundred years and more, after the dissolution thereof) and onely spake
of it, either by tradition, or conjecture, and therefore his authority of no
such strength, as to command our beliefe. Besides, he seems to have for|gotten
what formerly we cited out of him, for the narrowness of the
place, not admitting moe Courts in <HI>Solomons</HI> time. However, his eyes
were so dazeled with long looking on the second Temple extant in his

death of <HI>Solomon,</HI> might by succeeding Kings, have another Court added
thereunto; namely, when by art, industry, and great expense they had
raised up the valley, and gained more ground to <HI>the mountain of the house,</HI>
which was so small at the first. Hereof we finde a double insinuation
in Scripture:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 One, when <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> is said to stand <HI>in the house of the Lord before
the new<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 20. 5.</NOTE> Court,</HI> which probably about his reign, was added to
the ancient fabrick.</ITEM>

two Courts at the least, at that time belonging to the Temple,
into which the common people had free access. But herein no|thing

Wherefore, as the sons of <HI>Barzillai,</HI> though Priests, yet because they found

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Pillars in the Porch of the Temple.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. GOd at the first creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The expressive utensils of the Temple.</NOTE> having finished the elements, and
essentiall parts of the world, did afterwards furnish them
with creatures suitable thereunto, no vacuity being left: so
that rather then any thing should be empty, any thing will fill it. <HI>Solomon</HI>
in like manner, having ended the main rooms of the Temple, in the
n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">xt place made the furniture thereof, wherein every vessell was
pregnant with heavenly mysteries; so that what the Apostle saith of the
languages in the world<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14. 10.</NOTE> <HI>none of them are without signification,</HI> was true of
the smallest Uten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ill in the Temple, speaking much holy matter, had we
eares to hear, and hearts to understand it.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. We begin with the Porch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The different dimensions of the Pillars re|conclled.</NOTE> where the two great brazen pillars
were set up, each of them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 15.</NOTE> twelve Cubits in compass, (bearing a little
more then four Cubits in Diameter) four<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ier. 52. 21.</NOTE> fingers thick of solid me|tall,

of thirty and five Cubits high.</P></Q>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 To reconcile these, some have recourse to severall Cubits, <HI>common,</HI>
or <HI>great; of the first measure</HI> conceiving the former mentioned in
<HI>Kings;</HI> the latter (which were twice as big) intended in <HI>Chro|nicles.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Others understand the bare shaft of the Pillars to be eighteen
Cubits high, besides the Chapiters above, and Basis beneath
them: the former being<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 16.</NOTE> five Cubits, and the latter so many as
made the totall number thirty and five.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 A third<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ribera de iis qua erant in Temp. l. 2. ca. 11.</NOTE> sort most probably conjecture, that in <HI>Chronicles</HI> the
height of both Pillars are counted together.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Where if any object, that eighteen and egihteen Cubits make thirty six,
one more then the number in <HI>Chronicles; Ribera</HI> conceives that so much
onely as appeared of these pillars are summed up, each of them having
half a Cub it of their shaft lost in their height, as running in, and hid in
his Chapiter grafted upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="210">
&sect; 3. The chapiters of these pillars were curiously adorned with <HI>net|work,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their chapiters how adorned.</NOTE> chain-work,</HI> and <HI>rowes of pomegranats.</HI> These were but apples of brass,
whilest <HI>words spoken in due season</HI> are far more precious, being like those <HI>of

wherein though <HI>Hiram</HI> might imitate the fashion of those
flowers, no art could counterfeit their colours, seeing he who set him on
work, even<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Luk. 12. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon himself in all his glory was not arayed like one of these.</HI>
These pillars set in the porch did not like those two in <HI>Dagons</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 16. 29.</NOTE> Temple
support the main fabrick thereof, nor was any burden born by them,
but were onely (like brazen Andirons in great mens chimnies) for
ornament. Let none say unto them as the master to the men in the
market place,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mat. 20. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Why stand yee here all the day idle?</HI> seeing they were usefull in
their kind, and contributed much to the beauty of the Temple.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Others will say, these pillars were ill placed, because obscured
in the porch, where few did behold them. His kindred said to our Savi|our
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Iohn 7. 4.</NOTE> <HI>There is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th to be known
openly.</HI> Had <HI>Solomon</HI> for his credit intended to make the Temple appear glo|rious,
he should not so privately have concealed these pillars in the Porch.
<Q>&mdash;Occultae non gratia magna columnae.</Q>
Better had they been set like the <HI>Colossus</HI> at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> or the two Columns
before Saint <HI>Markes</HI> in <HI>Venice, sub dio,</HI> in the open aire. But here we must
know, first, that <HI>Solomon</HI> intended his Temple, not so much to be seen, as
to be glorious. Secondly, the door leading into the Porch, being ex|ceeding
broad, and high, these pillars were not wholly concealed, but a
great part, if not all of them, was exposed to publick view through the
door of the Porch.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. The Pillar<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meaning of the Pillars names.</NOTE> standing on the right hand in the<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 7. 21.</NOTE> Porch was called
<HI>Iachin,</HI> that is, <HI>he will stablish;</HI> and the other on the left side <HI>Boaz,</HI> that is,
<HI>in him is strength.</HI> Pity without power will be but lame to help us;
Power without pity will be but deaf to hear us; whilest both together
make a comfortable composition. Both these pillars we finde in a
manner erected in the expression of the leper<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Mat. 8. z.</NOTE> to our Saviour:
<Q><L><HI>Iachin,</HI> but doubtfully and conditionally, <HI>Lord if thou wilt.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Boaz,</HI> positively and absolutely, <HI>Thou canst make me clean.</HI></L></Q>
Both these pillars there set up, signified Gods protection of the place, and
<HI>the gates of hell</HI> could not prevail against that Temple, which had these
pillars in the Porch thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Besides this, in a secondary sense these two did resemble emi|nent
Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they my|ftically repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|sented.</NOTE> Ministers especially (such as <HI>Iames, Cephas,</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gal. 2. 9.</NOTE> who

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the furniture of the Sanctuary, or Inner Tample.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. AMongst the Utensils of the Sanctuary, we first look on the <HI>Can|dlestick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ten Candl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|sticks in the Temple.</NOTE>
and the light therein enables us, the better to behold all
the rest. The Tabernacle had but<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Exod. 37. 17.</NOTE> one, the Temple ten<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 49.</NOTE> Candlesticks
of pure gold, (this exceeding that <HI>ten to one</HI> in lustre) <HI>five on the right side,
and five on the left,</HI> each of them no doubt fashioned like that which <HI>Moses</HI>
made, seven fold with a great shaft for the body in the midst, and three
stems on each side branching out thereof. In some resemblance of the
seven <HI>Planets,</HI> amongst which the <HI>Sun,</HI> the stock of light, stands in the
midst, and three other on each side, above, and beneath it. Here we can|not
but minde the reader of a foul mistake in<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Anti. lib. 8. c. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus,</HI> who beholding
these Candlesticks through a multiplying glass, in stead of <HI>ten</HI> reads <HI>ten
thousand</HI> that <HI>Solomon</HI> made in his Temple. Yet we deny not, that besides
these ten standing Candlesticks of gold, there were many moe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oveable
ones, but all those made of<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 15.</NOTE> silver, which the Priests in the night might
carry about with them. By these Candlesticks also, having lights always
in them, Gods Ministers in generall were represented. For, to say, that by
these seven lamps in the ten Candlesticks (threescore and ten in all) the
<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Luk. 10. 1.</NOTE> seventy Disciples were designed, would savour of too much curiosity.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Next we take notice of the <HI>Table of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 48.</NOTE> shew-bread,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Table of Shew-bread.</NOTE> which <HI>Solomon</HI>
made of that gold, which his Father <HI>David</HI> had peculiarly prepared for
that<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 16.</NOTE> purpose. The particular dimensions, and fashion thereof,
is not mentioned in Scripture. Probably of the, like form with
that which <HI>Moses</HI> made in the Tabernacle, though of a far greater pro|portion.
On this loaves were daily presented to God; Who, not out of
any necessity (<HI>If I be hungry, I will not tell thee, for the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 50. 12.</NOTE> world is mine, and the
fulness thereof</HI>) but free will, was pleased to accept thereof: otherwise no
more needing this <HI>bread</HI> to <HI>feed,</HI> then the <HI>light of the lampes</HI> to <HI>guide</HI> him. The
bread on this Table was tendered to God, partly as a <HI>Quit-rent,</HI> in con|fession
that the <HI>Iews held</HI> all their food from his providence; and partly
as a <HI>Type of Christ, The<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6. 41.</NOTE> bread which came down from heaven.</HI> And, as <HI>serving|men</HI>
feed on the reversions which their <HI>Masters</HI> leave, so the Priests
(when new was substituted in the room of the formet) eate those loaves
which were taken away. Not pretending with<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Hist. Bel. v. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Bels</HI> Priests, that their
God eat up, what they secretly devoured themselves; but by license
from him, they openly avouched their lawfull repast thereupon.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. But the most eminent utensill in the <HI>Holy,</HI> was the <HI>Altar of incense,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Altar of incense.</NOTE>
made by <HI>Moses</HI> in the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> two<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Exod. 30. 2.</NOTE> cubits high, and four square:
namely, with a cubit in the length, and another in the breadth thereof.
Proportionable enough for that purpose, no sacrifices of bulk being to be
offered thereon, but onely sweet odours (much whereof might lie in
<PB N="392" REF="211">
little space) and <HI>spirituall spices</HI> (as I may term them) which took up but
smal room therein. <HI>Davids</HI> express care provided<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 18.</NOTE> <HI>refined gold</HI> for this Altar
of incense. And no doubt, <HI>Solomon,</HI> the Executour of his Will, performed it
accordingly. For, when it is said, that he<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 King. 6. 20.</NOTE> <HI>covered the Altar with Cedar,</HI> and
that <HI>hee</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 22.</NOTE> <HI>overlaid the whole Altar</HI> (elsewhere<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 48.</NOTE> <HI>made the Altar) which was by
the Oracle with gold;</HI> it can refer to none other, but this <HI>Altar of incense;</HI> see|ing,
that for burnt sacrifices, was made<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 4. 1.</NOTE> of brass. It seems that, when
<HI>Solomon</HI> made the <HI>Holy</HI> in the <HI>Temple,</HI> far larger then that in the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI>
and when every implement therein (to make the furniture proporti|onable
to the room) <HI>commenced</HI> and <HI>took an higher degree</HI> of glory and great|ness;
then he cased the old <HI>Altar of incense</HI> with Cedar, and overlaid the
same with gold, to be but the <HI>Basis</HI> and <HI>Pedestall</HI> of a greater Altar, which
for the same purpose he advanced thereupon.</P>

we may observe, that, although <HI>Solomon</HI> altered, and enlarged the Uten|sils
in the <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>outward Courts,</HI> yet in the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> he made use of
those numericall vessels of <HI>Moses</HI> his making, without any addition, or
alteration: as at the first formed so exactly, and fitted so suitably to the
privacy of the place, that it had been presumption to new modell them,
whose perfection was uncapeable of any higher improvement.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Yet <HI>Solomon</HI> for the more magnificence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solomons</HI> addi|tionall Cheru|bims.</NOTE> added two <HI>Cherubims,</HI> for
the matter, dimensions, position, and use thereof, distinguished from
those of <HI>Moses</HI> his making.

<ITEM>3 <HI>Moses</HI> his <HI>Cherubims</HI> lay on the <HI>Mercy-seat,</HI> both whose wings

extended to the whole breadth of the <HI>Holy of Holies.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4 <HI>Moses</HI> his <HI>Cherubims</HI> with their wings shadowed the <HI>Mercy-seat;
Solomons,</HI> like a golden arch, overshadowed those <HI>Cherubims;</HI> so
that in the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> there was a little Hierarchy, Angels above
Angels therein.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Wonder not that whilest <HI>Moses</HI> his <HI>Cherubims</HI> were of <HI>Massie gold</HI> (bearing
best proportion to the purity, and incorporeity of the <HI>Angelicall Nature</HI>)
that <HI>Solomons</HI> should be but <HI>overlaid with gold,</HI> having <HI>Olive-tree</HI> within
them. For so vast were their dimensions [<HI>ten cubits</HI> or thirty foot <HI>high]</HI>
that if of <HI>solid gold,</HI> a little <HI>land of Ophir</HI> might have lain within that com|pass.
And being to be made hollow, perchance it was necessary that
some wood <HI>for stiffenting</HI> should be put within them. These <HI>Cherubims</HI> were
the most gorgeous and costly ornaments in all the Temple, and proba|bly
were embezeled by the covetous <HI>Babylonians</HI> at the <HI>captivity,</HI> and ne|ver
brought back again, because onely essentiall<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ra 1. 9.</NOTE> <HI>vessels,</HI> and not all the
<HI>ornaments of State,</HI> were restored, and placed in the second Temple. To re|turn
to the <HI>Mercy-seat,</HI> under it: the <HI>Ark of the Covenant</HI> was placed, and
the Tables written with Gods own finger, were put therein.</P>

the <HI>Ark of the Covenant,</HI> as described in the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Testament.</HI>
<Q><BIBL>1 King. 8. 9. &amp; 2 Chron: 5. 10.</BIBL> <P>There was nothing in the Ark save the

Behold here the <HI>Ark</HI> filled (not to say crowded) by the Apostle with
other implements; which the <HI>Old Testament</HI> onely a Repositary for the
<HI>Tables of the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4. Amongst the many answers tendered by learned men, in soluti|on
to this difficulty, none in my opinion so satisfactory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the same satisfied.</NOTE> as what<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">De iis quae e|rant in Templo. lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Ribera</HI>
first bringeth, and<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">In his paral|lels on Heb. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Iunius</HI> (otherwise in judgement much different from

the Ark (though last named) but to <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the Tabernacle,</HI> called, <HI>The holiest

<PB N="394" REF="212">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the vessels in the Priests Court.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. SO much for the Utensils in the covered Temple.<NOTE PLACE="marg">One onely Altar.</NOTE> Proceed we
now into the Priests Court, and there first finde the brazen <HI>Altar,</HI>
having twenty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 4. 1.</NOTE> cubits in length, as much in breadth, and ten in the
height thereof. Now, although <HI>Solomon</HI> made ten <HI>candlesticks,</HI> ten <HI>lavers,</HI>
ten &amp;c. yet he confined himself to one <HI>Altar of incense,</HI> one <HI>Altar of sacrifice,</HI>
(multiplying of <HI>Altars</HI> hearing ill in Scripture, as suspicious of Idolatry)
but whether therein pointing at Christ our <HI>onely Mediatour,</HI> or at the unity
of the Church, let others dispute.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Now seriously considering this <HI>Altar,</HI> we meet with many
wonders therein. First, that being set <HI>sub dio,</HI> in the open aire, it is
strange that rain (presumed sometimes to fall in great plenty, with
great violence) did not extinguish the fire thereof. Secondly, seeing
continuall fire was kept there, it is wonder, that the whole Court (as the
Chimney-generall thereof) was not turned <HI>Tawny-More,</HI> if not <HI>Black-More</HI>
with the constant soot, smuttiness, and smoking thereof. Third|ly,
it is strange, that in so short time, so many sacrifices could be
consumed, within the compass of so small a place; especially at the
dedication of the Temple, when,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 King. 8. 5.</NOTE> <HI>sacrificing Sheep and Oxen that
could not be told, nor numbred for multitude.</HI> Lastly, it is admirable, that
in a Climate so hot, and place so populous, no putrefaction did arise
from the bloud, fat, offall, and ordure of so many beasts slain there,
to the infecting of the Priests, and people thereabouts. We know
how noisome, and offensive slaughter-houses in Sommer, are in
great Cities; insomuch that <HI>Tertio Richardi secundi</HI> a motion was made,
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ws Survey of London. p. 340.</NOTE> that no Butcher should kill any flesh within <HI>London,</HI> but at <HI>Knights|bridge,</HI>
or some such distant place from the walls of the City.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. But under favour I conceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unwondred if the nature of the fire be con|sidered.</NOTE> the true satisfying of these dif|ficulties
depends on the right understanding of the nature, or rather
the supernaturall qualities of the fire on the Altar. It was not com|mon,
or culinary fire, but such as<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 7. 1.</NOTE> came down from heaven: which
(amongst other peculiar properties where with it was endowed) was
so far from being quenched by rain, or water, that it would quickly
lick it up, though<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 King 18. 38.</NOTE> a <HI>trench,</HI> containing <HI>twelve barrels,</HI> were filled there|with:
as in the sacrifice of <HI>Elijah</HI> (fetching fire from the same originall)
it came to pass. Secondly, such celestiall flame, being of a more clarified,
and refined substance&punc; left not any suffocating smoke, or sooty feculency
behind it. Thirdly, being sent from heaven not to dally, but dispatch the
work (God employs no slugs on his errands) it made speedy riddance of
the matter in hand, and consumed the sacrifice of a sudden. We know
how quickly <HI>lightning</HI> (though not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, much of kin to the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> on
<PB REF="213">
the Altar) will turn any thing that resists it, into ashes. Hereupon,
some conceive, that by <HI>Ariel,</HI> that is, <HI>Gods Lion,</HI> in the<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Isa. 29. 1.</NOTE> Prophet,
the <HI>Altar in the Temple</HI> is meant. A voracious Lion indeed, which
with <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> lean kine, devoured many thousands of cattell, and was
no whit the fatter for the same. Lastly, such heavenly fire was a great
preservative against infection, and the purgative nature thereof, swept
away much putrefaction, which otherwise would have proved very
noisome.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Pass we now from the <HI>fire,</HI> to the <HI>Water:</HI> from the <HI>Altar,</HI> to the <HI>Molten
sea.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The brazen Sea.</NOTE> A worthy vessell this was, of solid brass; five cubits high, and ten
over from side to side, <HI>being</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 23.</NOTE> <HI>round all about,</HI> and thirty cubits in compass,
containing two thousand <HI>Baths:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 King. 7. 26.</NOTE> namely, as they filled it, but <HI>two parts
of three</HI> for ordinary use, leaving a third part for empty <HI>Margin</HI> in the top.
Otherwise were it filled brimfull, it would in all receive <HI>three<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 4. 5.</NOTE> thousand
Baths,</HI> where the totall capacity thereof is computed. Therefore called a
<HI>Sea</HI> from the large containt thereof (and not much unlike the <HI>Caspian sea,</HI>
for the circular form, and entireness thereof) having its brim wrought
about with <HI>lily-work,</HI> and it stood upon twelve oxen, which by four seve|rall
Threes respected the quarters of the world.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. But now the question will be, How this vast vessell was furni|shed
with water?<NOTE PLACE="marg">How supplyed with water.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon,</HI> speaking of the Ocean,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 1. 7.</NOTE> <HI>All the rivers</HI> (saith
he) <HI>run into the sea;</HI> but, how this artificiall <HI>sea,</HI> was supplied with any
water by peoples industry, is a considerable question; the Temple of
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> being so highly situated on a mountain. Here the <HI>Rabbins</HI> tell
us of a Well<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Maimony in Biat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mikdash. per 5. &amp; Talm. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rus. in Ioura per. 3. sol. 41.</NOTE> <HI>Etam,</HI> some distance hence&punc; whence the water was conveyed
in pipes, so that the Temple had it always in great abundance. We con|fess,
there was a<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 4. 32.</NOTE> city, and<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 15. 11. &amp; 19.</NOTE> rock of <HI>Etam</HI> in the Tribe of <HI>Simeon:</HI> near
to which a miraculous fountain issued in the days of <HI>Samson,</HI> to quench
his thirst, out of the <HI>jawbone of an Ass.</HI> And it seems, the <HI>Ghost</HI> of this foun|tain
did <HI>walk</HI> in the brains of the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> when first they invented this
tradition. But, this <HI>Etam,</HI> being full forty miles from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> was
likely to afford them little water, for the replenishing of this <HI>Molten sea.</HI>
Rather we beleeve, that the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> or <HI>Nethinims,</HI> whose office it was
to be<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Icsh. 9. 27.</NOTE> drawers of water for the Congregation, out of the fountain of
<HI>Siloam,</HI> or <HI>Pool of Bethesda</HI> hard by, filled this <HI>Sea,</HI> and furnished
all other Lavatories, and Offices about the Temple, with that necessary
element. Yea, probably there were some wells within the verge of the
Temple, seeing <HI>Ierusalem</HI> is charactred by <HI>Strabo,</HI> an Heathen writer, to
be <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>well watered within it self,</HI> though without the walls it
wanted the conveniency thereof. And, which is the main, in <HI>Ezekiels</HI>
description of the Temple, which one may term <HI>A visionarie varnish on an
historicall ground-work,</HI> being a literall truth mystically much improved, we
finde, the waters<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 47. 1.</NOTE> <HI>issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward,</HI> which
swelled to a miraculous proportion. Now, though the increase, and
<PB N="395" REF="213">
overflowing of such streams, was extraordinary, and propheticall; yet
surely the fountain thereof was reall, and naturall, importing some
springs in the Temple, whence the <HI>Nethinims</HI> did fill this <HI>Molten sea,</HI> and
all other vessels with water, designed for the Priests to<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 4. 6.</NOTE> wash themselves
therein.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Having thus dispatched the <HI>Molten sea,</HI> the <HI>ten</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Lavers</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ten Lavers.</NOTE> (being as it
were but so many <HI>little lakes</HI>) will quickly be described. In the <HI>Tabernacle</HI>
none of these were extant, as appointed for the washing of sacrifices:
(for, that single Laver made by <HI>Moses</HI> for the Priests service, answered one|ly
to the <HI>Molten sea</HI>) whereby it appears, that <HI>Solomon,</HI> not onely made in
his <HI>Temple,</HI> vessels moe in <HI>number,</HI> and bigger in <HI>degree,</HI> but also other in
<HI>kind,</HI> then were in the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> to fill and furnish the magnificence there|of.
These <HI>Lavers</HI> of brass contained forty <HI>Baths</HI> apiece, each set on his <HI>ba|sis</HI>
with <HI>wheels,</HI> for their more convenient removall, though generally
their station was <HI>five on the one side, and five on the other</HI> in the Court of the
Priests, and east of the covered Temple.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. In the outward Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Utensils of the outward court.</NOTE> or Court of <HI>Israel</HI> many (no doubt) were
the Utensils thereof. As that <HI>brazen</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 6. 13.</NOTE> <HI>scaffold</HI> made by <HI>Solomon</HI> for the King
to stand, and pray upon, the same (as <HI>Tremellius</HI> conceives) with the
<HI>Kings</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 23. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Pillar:</HI> with the Pulpits and deskes, wherein the Priests expoun|ded
the law to the people. But as for the remainder of the vessels of the
Temple, with the manyfold traditions concerning them, the Reader is
referred to the learned paines of my industrious friend M^r. <HI>Iohn Lightfoot:</HI>
who, as I understand, intends an entire Treatise thereof. Far be it from
me, that our pens should fall out, like the heardsmen<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gen. 13. 6.</NOTE> of <HI>Lot,</HI> and <HI>Abra|ham,
the land being not able to bear them both, that they might dwell together.</HI> No
such want of room in this subject, being of such latitude, and receipt,
that both we, and hundreds moe, busied together therein, may severally
lose our selves in a subject of such capacity. The rather because we em|brace
severall courses in this our Description, it being my desire, and de|light,
to stick onely to the written word of God, whilest my worthy
friend takes in the choicest <HI>Rabbinicall,</HI> and <HI>Talmudicall</HI> relations, being so
well seen in those studies, that it is questionable, whether his skill, or
my ignorance, be the greater therein.</P>

not danced; we have mourned, and yee have not lamented:</HI> seeing such the
sociableness of Musick, it conformes it selfe to all companies,
both in mirth, and mourning, complying to improve that passion,
with which it findes the Auditours most affected. In a word, it is an

sacrifices consisted in the <HI>pars quota,</HI> in the exact quantity of the

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The additionall Utensils of the Temple after

<P>&sect; 1. MAny other instruments were added to the Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chest which <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hoiada</HI> the Priest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ade.</NOTE> after
<HI>Solomons</HI> death, by succeeding Kings, as occasion did require.
Amongst which, we must take especiall notice of that Chest,
which in the reign of King <HI>Iehoash,</HI> was made by <HI>Iehoiada</HI> the high-Priest,
to receive the peoples free-offerings for the repair of the Temple.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. It may seem strange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Tem|ple so much ruined in so short a time.</NOTE> that the Temple built so substantially at
the first, of the most solid materialls, should in so short a time of an
hundred and fifty years, run so far to ruine, as to need so costly repara|tion.
But, we must know, it stood without shelter, high on a mount,
exposed to tempests, and in the last seven years of wicked <HI>Athaliahs</HI> reign
(gray hairs are multiplyed on men, more by afflictions, then old age)
besides neglect of reparation, did<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 24. 7.</NOTE> meet with despightfull defacing
thereof. <HI>Iehoash</HI> therefore resolves to amend the decays therein, as in|deed
he stood obliged, both in credit, and conscience; for, seeing the
Temple had formely been the nursing-mother to <HI>Iehoash,</HI> well might
<HI>Iehoash</HI> be the nursing-father to the Temple; who now did onely
<GAP DESC="foreign">, pay for his feeding and breeding, who six years
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 22. 12.</NOTE> had his preservation, and his education therein.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. The care of the work,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Levites</HI> why backward in repairing the Temple.</NOTE> was at first committed to the charge of the <HI>Le|vites</HI>
in generall, though it thrived not under their managing therof, so that
in the twenty third year of the reign of King <HI>Iehoash, they had not repaired the</HI>
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">2 King. 12. 7.</NOTE> <HI>breaches of the house.</HI> We can not be so uncharitable, as to conceive, they
embez'led the monies appointed for that purpose, but rather impute
their slow proceedings herein, either to
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 The unhappiness usually attending great undertakings, few
effectually advancing that work, wherein all are equally in|trusted.
Or else,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Being every one <HI>to receive money of their own</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">2 King. 12. 5.</NOTE> <HI>acquaintance,</HI> some car|nall
indulgence might be used therein to retard the business.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Receiving small sums of severall persons, they were insensible
in the taking, and inconsiderable in their laying out.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Repairing was out of the <HI>Levites</HI> element, having no dexterity
therein; and we know, that Ministers, and Church-wardens
are two distinct employments.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Hereupon the <HI>Levites</HI> by King <HI>Iehoash</HI> are called, checked, commanded
to forbear farther collection of money, and some other particular persons
deputed for that purpose, who had more care, skill, and success to order
the matter.</P>

contribute to so pious a work. It was placed very handy, and conve|nient

<HI>set<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> beside the Altar on the right side</HI> in the outward-court <HI>as one came into the

this chest so fit for dexterous Benefactours, when advising in giving of
almes, <HI>Let<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Mat. 6. 3.</NOTE> not thy left hand know what thy right doth.</HI> In this chest were
mens charities cast, and kept till amounting to a great sum, (and then
the breaches of the Temple were perfectly repaired therewith) and
in after-ages, it was called <HI>Corban,</HI> which name sometimes signi|fieth
the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mar. 7. 11.</NOTE> gift it self, sometimes the vessell receiving it, which
was the pattern (not to say parent) of the <HI>poor-mens-boxes</HI> in our

<P>&sect; 5. Here we must not forget that Diall of <HI>Ahaz</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ahaz his Dial.</NOTE> (in those days,
no doubt, a master-piece of art) whereon the Sun miraculously
went back ten<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">2 King. 20. 9.</NOTE> degrees, in token that <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> life should goe
forward fifteen degrees. Some conceive this Dial, not drawn on
the outside of any wall, or house, but contrived within a winding
stair-case, so that every step thereof bare proportion to the distance
of an houre: but whether this fancy may be reconciled to art, be
it referred to the judicious in dialling. However it was made, we
shall scarce meet with a Dial more ancient in any authour, which
many years after retained the name of <HI>Ahaz</HI> the erectour thereof.
But for all this Dial, <HI>Ahaz</HI> was one of those who could not <HI>dis|cern
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mat. 16. 3.</NOTE> the signes of the times,</HI> nor perceive <HI>the day of his visitation;</HI> how
his kingdome, being past the flourishing Meridian thereof, did draw

<P>&sect; 6. <HI>Adrichomius</HI> placeth this Dial on the House of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Adrichomius</HI> his conceit concerning this Dial.</NOTE> and
therefore we mention it here amongst the ornaments of the Tem|ple.
Though, to speak my opinion, on perusall of the text, it ap|pears
rather set up in some open place in the Kings Palace, so that
sick <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> for the farther confirmation of his faith, lying on
his bed, might look on the retrograde motion of the Sun thereon:
though I deny not, but he might receive information thereof from
relation of others. But would<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">In quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a parte Templi.</NOTE> <HI>Adrichomius</HI> had acquainted us, whence

<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 King. 16. 17.</NOTE> Scripture tells us, that he took down the twelve brazen oxen
from under the great sea, and it was poor reparation for his
sacriledge, if in lieu thereof he set up a Dial, with figures for
twelve houres, or perchance the twelve signes of the Zodiack there|upon.
But carnall men conceive, they may safely steale Gods dove,
and stick down a feather in the room thereof.</P>

&sect; 7. Now besides the originall Utensils of the Temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two eminent supplies of ho|ly instruments.</NOTE> of the
same foundation with the Temple it self, there were severall re|cruits
(not of different, but the same fashion with the former)
which succeeding Kings made in stead of those instruments, which
constant use and age had empaired. For, we must not think, that
the Ash-pans, Fire-pans, Snuffers, Caldrons, and Flesh-hooks of
the Temple, were like the bush appearing to<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Exod. 3. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Moses,</HI> always
burning, yet never consumed: or, that the knives used about the
sacrifices, were like the<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Deut. 29. 5.</NOTE> clothes of the children of <HI>Israel</HI> in the

daily decay, and were duly repaired, especially in the reign of King

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The Temple often spoiled of her Treasure

<P>&sect; 1. THe first Temple of God at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple pillaged by <HI>Shishak</HI> King of <HI>Egypt, &amp; Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sh</HI> King of <HI>Israel.</HI></NOTE> often had the same

Twice was it pillaged by forein foes, and four times by her own friends

in the reign of <HI>Rehoboam, took<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 14. 26.</NOTE> away the treasures of the house of the Lord,</HI>
This wound, whence so much precious wealth did bleed forth, first
shewed, the Temple with the riches therein to be mortall. <HI>Shishak</HI>
did then but brush the house of God, whilest he swept the house of
the King, whence <HI>he even took away</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>all.</HI> Afterwards <HI>Ioash</HI> King of <HI>Israel</HI>

gold and silver, and the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom,

thing not impossible for them to doe, having formerly hid a young
King, and his nurse six<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 22. 12.</NOTE> years invisible, from the jealous eyes of <HI>Atha|liah.</HI>
<PB N="402" REF="218">
And now, seeing idolatrous <HI>Ioash</HI> carried away this holy treasure
to <HI>Samaria,</HI> let none hereafter conclude the best cause from the best
success, finding the Cherubims of <HI>Solomons</HI> setting up, worsted by the

<P>&sect; 2. By the way, it is very remarkable, that the Tabernacle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Taberna|cle never plu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">red, and why?</NOTE> which

in that age were as sinfull, and their enemies as spightfull, <HI>Moabites, Mi|dianites,
Ammonites, &amp;c.</HI> who in the interim betwixt the Judges, oppres|sed
the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> though we finde none of them offering any af|front,
or violence to the Utensils of the Tabernacle. As for the <HI>Philistims,</HI>
though they took the Ark by conquest in the field, we know they were
forced with a witness to bring it back again. Whereas the Temple within
less space was by forein Princes often pilled and polled of the ornaments
belonging thereunto. Enquiring into the reason hereof, we meet with
none more probable, then because Divine providence delighteth in pro|tecting
what is weakest in it self. And seeing the Tabernacle was altoge|ther
undefensible, and able to make no resistance, consisting onely of thin
boards, slight skins, &amp; slender curtains, God more immediately walled it
about with an awefull respect, which the very enemies thereof bare unto
it. Whereas the Temple, being a strong structure of stone, in a stronger
City, with walls, gates, and bars, visibly intitled it self to fortification,
and therefore God left it to the arme of flesh to defend it, which fre|quently
failed therein, as nothing can be safe, which hath onely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">infull
men to secure it.</P>

thereby to save the head. The parting with the fruit, kept the tree alive;
otherwise, if not pacified with such a present, the idolatrous enemies
would undoubtedly have demolished the Temple, and totally rooted
out Gods service therein.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. But what ever politick palliations may be pleaded for the con|trary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such argume~ts answered.</NOTE>
such sacriledge was unavouchable in it self, and those pretended
extremities to justifie it, were onely created; either by mens infidelity,
not beleeving Gods power; or their impatience, not atten|ding
Gods pleasure, to defend his own glory, in his own due time,
by his own means. Yea, Heaven by the finall success protested against
such proceedings, and the treasure taken out of the Temple, and given to
Pagans, rather presently declined, then finally diverted the imminent
danger. Thus <HI>Ahaz<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 28. 21.</NOTE> took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and gave
it to the King of Assyria, but he helped him not.</HI> Likewise when<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">2 King. 18. 15, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Hezekiah</HI> pre|sented
<HI>Sennacherib</HI> with the wealth of the Temple to buy his favour, his
bribes proved ineffectull, who having received the present, was not
pleased to understand the language thereof, but nevertheless in the next
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 17.</NOTE> verse invaded <HI>Iudah.</HI> As for the instance of <HI>Asa,</HI> God directly by the
mouth of his Prophet reproved him for his fact, in relying rather on the
King of <HI>Syria,</HI> then divine assistance. In a word, though some were
good men that did it, they were no whit the better for the doing it.
For, though it be Christian policy, and Christs<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Luk. 16. 9.</NOTE> precept, <HI>that men make to
themselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness;</HI> yet, goods rightly conse|crated

holy things are unjustly <HI>degraded,</HI> which having once been advanced
to the dignity of a <HI>free-will-offering</HI> to God, are afterward set back, to be|come
a <HI>peace-offering</HI> to man.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Indeed some hold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No sacriledge, say some, under the Gospell.</NOTE> that under the Gospell the sin of sacriledge
cannot be committed. If so, it is either because nothing under the
Gospell hath been given to Gods service; or, because God hath solemn|ly
disclaimed the acceptance of any such donations; which, when and
where it was done, will be hardly produced. If this their position be true,
we have cause, first, to rejoyce in regard that God and his members are
now adays growen so rich, that they need not addition of humane gra|tuities
to be bestowed upon them. Secondly, we may congratulate the
felicity of ours above former ages, being not in a capacity of committing
the sin of sacriledge, to which those were subject, who lived before the
time of our Saviour. Lastly, we may silently smile, to see how Satan is

men now adays being secured from this sin, and put past a possi|bility
to be guilty thereof. But, before we goe thus far, let us first be sure,
we goe on a good ground, otherwise it is the highest sacriledge, to steal
away sacriledge it self, and to deny that (which formerly was a grie|vous)
in our days to be any transgression.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The mean preparations for building this Temple.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. _THe seventy years of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity expi|red,
God moved the spirit of <HI>Cyrus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyrus his pro|clamation.</NOTE> (whose name
the Prophet<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Isa. 44. 28.</NOTE> mentioneth two hundred years be|fore
his birth) not onely by his<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ezra 1. 1.</NOTE> proclamation
to permit Gods people, to return to their native
Countrey, and thereby to encourage others to
contribute necessaries unto them; but also restored the vessels of <HI>Solomons</HI>
making, and furnished them with provisions out of his own Exchequer,
for the erection of a second Temple, which came after the former, not moe
years in time, then degrees in magnificence. A thing no whit strange,
if the disparity betwixt the builders be seriously considered.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference in power.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon</HI> was an absolute Prince, full of wealth and power,
in his peaceable Countrey, where no <HI>dog durst bark against him</HI> (save two
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 King. 11. 14. 23.</NOTE> or three whapping curs toward the end of his reign) whilest the buil|ders
of this second Temple were but raw captives, newly returned to
their native land, where they met with much disturbance, and con|stant
opposition from their enemies. Wherefore, no such (almost mi|raculous)
silence observed at the second Temple, like that in the first,
wherein<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 King 6.7.</NOTE> <HI>no tool of iron was heard,</HI> it being probable, here was knocking of
hammers, and (certain) here was clashing of malicious foes agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the
faithfull <HI>Israelites.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In number.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon</HI> (though alternately) employed <HI>seven score</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 King 5. 15.</NOTE> <HI>and
ten thousand hewers and burden-bearers,</HI> besides <HI>three thousand three hundred over|seers</HI>
at the building of his Temple; whereas the totall sum, and whole
company of this <HI>Remnant,</HI> or rather, <HI>Reversion</HI> of the <HI>Iews,</HI> with <HI>their
<PB N="410" REF="222">

third of the former number. As few the men: so were they ill furni|shed
with all kinde of cattell. And whereas <HI>Camels</HI> had been necessary
creatures to be used by them, for bearing of burdens at this structure, so
meanly were they provided therewith, that<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Compare Iob 1. 3. with Ezra 2. 67.</NOTE> <HI>Iob</HI> a private man, had six
times (and after his restoration <HI>twelve</HI> times) more <HI>Camels,</HI> then all the
whole nation of the <HI>Iews</HI> had in their possession, when returning from
captivity.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In wealth.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon</HI> had (besides other vast in-comes, and a <HI>bank</HI>
provided by <HI>David</HI> his Father) the <HI>gold of Ophir</HI> swimming unto him in
the <HI>ships</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 King. 9. 28. &amp; 10. 22.</NOTE> <HI>of Tarshish,</HI> making their trienniall returns. Whereas no such

time, <HI>silver</HI> was as <HI>silver</HI> in scarcity, and esteem, and the <HI>exchange</HI> of all
coin ran very high in valuation. And, whereas the cost expended by
<HI>Solomon</HI> on his Temple amounted to many thousands of<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">2. 14. &amp; 1 Chr. 29. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Talents,</HI> unto
which are added <HI>ten</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 29. 7.</NOTE> <HI>thousand drams of gold</HI> (onely as a supernumerary
fraction, or odde sum above the entire Talents) the free-will-offering
to the second Temple is not at all computed by <HI>Talents,</HI> which would
have disgraced their poor provisions, but (to stick to our <HI>new translation</HI>)
is onely summed up by<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ezra 2. 69.</NOTE> <HI>drams</HI> (as the silver not by <HI>Talents,</HI> but <HI>pounds</HI>)
for the greater grace and credit of their contribution, so small in it self,
but large (no doubt) in proportion unto their poor estates.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No eminent ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">izan.</NOTE> here was not (as in the making of the Tabernacle) any

<P>&sect; 7. Some will object,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great promises ill performed.</NOTE> all these defects were eminently supplyed by
the favour of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who in his <HI>Charta Magna</HI> for the building of the

But, what saith our proverbe? <HI>Better children weep, then old folk:</HI> and it

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The dimensions of the Temple, and the foundations thereof laid.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. BE it premised for an undeniable truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This far less then <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple.</NOTE> that this Temple fell
short of <HI>Solomons</HI> in the dimensions thereof. Which plainly
appears, first, by the question the Prophet propoundeth;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Hagg. 2. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Who
is le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t among you, that saw this house in her first glory? and how doe you see it now?
Is it not in your eies, in comparison of it, as nothing?</HI> Secondly, by the tears the
old men<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ezra 3. 12.</NOTE> shed, when the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> foundation thereof was laid, whilest they
beheld the meanness of the one with their eyes, and recollected the
magnificence of the other in their memories.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. But here we meet with (almost) an inextricable difficulty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection to the contrary.</NOTE>
For, notwithstanding the premises so plain to the contrary, the dimen|sions
of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Temple appear larger then those of <HI>Solomons,</HI> if the en|suing
parable be seriously perused.</P>
<P><Q><BIBL>1 King. 6. 2.</BIBL> <P>And the house which King Solomon built
for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore
cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits.</P></Q><Q><BIBL>Ezra 6. 3.</BIBL> <P>Let the foundations thereof be strongly
laid, the height thereof threescore
cubits, and the breadth thereof three|score
cubits.</P></Q>
Behold here, how <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Temple was <HI>thirty Cubits</HI> higher (just as
high again) and <HI>forty cubits</HI> broader (thrice as broad) as <HI>Solomons.</HI> And,
although the length of this second Temple is not expressed, yet an ordi|nary
judgement will infer by the symmetrie of building, that the length
thereof must needs be much greater, to manage such a breadth in any
due proportion of Architecture. This so strong an evidence to the con|trary,
would almost have perswaded one to beleeve, that their old men
were either deceived with their dim eyes, or mistaken in their fraile
memories, and that this Temple was greater then the former, did not
the infallible testimonies of the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">gga. 2. 3. Zech&punc; 4. 10.</NOTE> Prophets so peremptorily avouch the
comparative smalness thereof, in respect of <HI>Solomons.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Many are the solutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Salv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> re|jected.</NOTE> which the learned produce in satis|faction
of this difficulty. But, first, as for their conjecture, that <HI>Zorobabel,</HI>
at the building of this Temple, purposely abated of those dimensions
assigned by <HI>Cyrus</HI> (as too great for him to compass) contenting him|self
with a less scantling, but more proportionable to the weak power
of his people: I can in no wise concur with them therein. For, in such
de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">alcation of measures by <HI>Cyrus</HI> allotted, he shewed little courtship to
his master the Emperour, (in distrusting the performance of his pro|mises)
and less religion to <HI>the Lord his God,</HI> in not beleeving, that he,
who miraculously <HI>had stirred up the spirit of Cyrus</HI> to appoint, would
also vigorously inable him (or his successours) to effect the aforesaid
<HI>assignment,</HI> in building of his Temple.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="223">
&sect; 4. Some suspect a mistake of numbers in <HI>Cyrus</HI> his <HI>Grant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Others<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d.</NOTE> which
notwithstanding will very hardly be admitted. For, seeing the laws of
the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> could<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Dan. 6. 8.</NOTE> <HI>never be altered,</HI> they were highly concerned
to be accurate, and exact, in their entering, and inrolling all <HI>Deeds on
Record.</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hers justly make a difference in the measures, and whilest
<HI>Solomons</HI> were sufficiently known to have been of the<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>first measure,</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Tremellius in locum Ezrae.</NOTE> they
conceive <HI>Cyrus</HI> his cubits to be common ones, but half as large as the
former. And thus this second Temple, though sixty cubits high, was
for the main body thereof, but just even with <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple. Mean time
it came far short of <HI>Solomons</HI> in this respect, because <HI>Solomons</HI> had amost
beautifull <HI>Porch,</HI> in nature of a <HI>Tower-steeple,</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 3. 4.</NOTE> one hundred and twenty
cubits high (that was double the body of the Temple) whilest no such
aspiring building graced the second Temple, being all of one uniforme
height.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. This difficulty in the height thus satisfied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breadth how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aken in Scri|pture.</NOTE> by the difference of
<HI>cubits,</HI> let none be troubled at the breadth of this second Temple, tripling
that of <HI>Solomons,</HI> seeing here <HI>breadth</HI> is taken (as elsewhere in Scripture)

cast a greater odium on Christ, by widening the disproportion between

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Generall observables in Herods building.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. THus satisfied for the main,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Full credit not required to Io|sephus.</NOTE> that <HI>Herod</HI> rebuilt <HI>Zorobabels</HI>
Temple, come we to some memorable observables therein,
gathered out of <HI>Iosephus,</HI> whose single band if the Reader
shall refuse to accept, we can tender him no better, yea, no other securi|rity.
It is not therefore expected, that all which <HI>Iosephus</HI> relates, should
be credited in the full latitude thereof, it is enough if the judicious Rea|der
(with<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 18.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> in another case concerning the reports of the
<HI>Corinthians</HI>) doth <HI>partly beleeve it.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 2. First, to satisfie, and content the <HI>Iews</HI> (half suspecting his
power, or pleasure to rebuild the Temple) he plucked not down
the old Temple, till all necessaries for the new one were perfectly
provided, and brought in place, ready to be set up, lest otherwise be|tween
two Temples, none at all should be left. Such as take down one
Church, before fully furnished for the setting up of a new, make a dan|gerous
breach for profaneness, and Atheisme to enter in thereat. No such
<HI>regnum</HI> for Satan, as in the <HI>interregnum</HI> between two religions.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. As for the dimensions of <HI>Herods</HI> Temple in relation to <HI>Solomons,</HI>
the ensuing parallel thus presents them unto us,
<Q><BIBL>1 King. 6. 2.</BIBL> <P>And the house which King Solomon built for

brought hither? If the stones on <HI>Sarisbury</HI> plain, in a levell and flat Coun|trey,

admiration, that judicious men resolve them not reall, but factitious
stones, of grit cemented with some unctuous matter, how can we con|ceive
that these solid stones (four of them being the ful length of the Tem|ple)
were managed hither, farther off from the sea, over a mountainous
Countrey? However, that great, and goodly stones were here, the
<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Mark. 13. 1.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the Disciples observation,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Luk, 21. 5.</NOTE> doth sufficient|ly
prove.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. The <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> had the inside thereof made onely by the
Priests (others not presuming to come on the ground) whereof a thou|sand
were found very cunning in building.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priests builders</NOTE> Now, although Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
was a Pharisee, and a<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Act 18. 3.</NOTE> <HI>tent-maker</HI> (the principles of that sect annexing
some trade to their profession) it is strange, so many Priests, though
skilfull in the <HI>Mathematicall,</HI> should be so dexterous in the <HI>manual</HI> part
thereof. The pinnacles of the Temple (saith <HI>Iosephus</HI>) were made so
sharp, that a bird could not sit on them, to prevent the defiling thereof.
Wherefore when the Devill set our Saviour on<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mat. 4. 5.</NOTE> a <HI>pinnacle of the Temple,</HI>
(where no doubt his feet stood fast without any miracle, which the
Devill could not, and Christ would not causlesly work, as presumption
against the will of his Father) we understand thereby, not such a sharp
<HI>pinnacle,</HI> but some <HI>bartlement, wing,</HI> or <HI>brink,</HI> of building,
higher then the
rest of the fabrick.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. It was finished (of all the days of the year) on <HI>Herods</HI> birth-day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Finished on Herods birth|day.</NOTE>
and therefore (saith <HI>Iosephus</HI>) the joy was the greater, two such eminent
causes thereof meeting together. In very good time no doubt. Indeed
the memories of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Iacob;</HI> or, of <HI>Simon &amp; Iude,</HI> have been anciently
celebrated on the same day, being paires of pious persons well agreeing a|mongst

with hell; <HI>God</HI> with <HI>Herod,</HI> that they should be coupled together,

did many years after, on his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mat. 14. 6.</NOTE> <HI>birth-day,</HI> beheading <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ptist.</HI> The

same authour reports they had it by tradition, that it never rained on the
day-time, but onely by night, during the building of the Temple,
that so the labour of the workmen might not be interrupted.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. But a more improbable passage falls from the pen of <HI>Iosephus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An incredible report.</NOTE> when he reports, that the Temple when finished, sunk down twenty
cubits in the foundation, which the skilfull in Architecture will hiss at as
an untruth. For,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Strange that all parts thereof (as if by mutuall consent) should at
once equally sink directly down, such an even, and eminent
proportion; the same weight above meeting with just the same
weakness beneath, and no more in one place, then another. And
grant, the walls all agreed to sink together, it is much,
the beams were not broken with the sudden subsidency of the
building.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Such a sinking fabrick would have frighted the Priests from offi|ciating
therein, and death hanging over their heads disturbed
their devotion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 The same authour reports, that the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> in <HI>Herods</HI> Tem|ple
was just twenty cubits high. If so, then by the sinking of this
fabrick, it was wholly swallowed in the earth, turned into a cel|lar,
so that the High-Priest, in Scripture phrase, must not <HI>go up,</HI>
but <HI>go down</HI> unto it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 The Disciples, when gazing on the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Mark 13. 1.</NOTE> greatness of the stones,

Wherefore with the sinking of his Temple, <HI>Iosephus</HI> his cred it sinkes
twenty cubits in my estimation, enough almost to make one un-believe

take principall notice of two eminent braveries. First, the <HI>Golden

the stature of a man, as if corrivals in greatness to those <HI>bunches

but desirous of information; zeal not being to be wrought, but

their money, or rather to let it out for the interest of popular applause&punc;

ruined, and her vessels taken away, two grand warnings were gi|ven
the <HI>Iews,</HI> seasonably to amend, and prevent farther mischief. The
first in that famous year wherein <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Mark Antony</HI> were Consuls,
some sixty years before our Saviours birth, when<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iosephus Ant. Iud. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. 14. 6. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Pompey</HI> the great, ha|ving
taken the City and Temple, entred the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> with some of
his souldiers, the floor whereof had formerly felt no other feet, but those
of the high Priests, and those but once a year. Here he saw mysterious
ornaments, understanding (not the meaning but) the matter thereof to
be pure gold; a shroud bait to tempt his hungry souldiers to sacriledge,
besides two thousand talents of silver in the treasury of the Temple. On
all which he onely feasted his, and his officers eies, whilest their hands
did fast, not diminishing the least mite thereof, in veneration of that deity
to whom they did belong; Onely he took on him to restore <HI>Hircanus</HI> to
be high Priest, a presage that the Jewish Priesthood would shortly fall
down, which already did so shake, that the high Priest needed to take a
<HI>Presentation, ad corroborandum,</HI> from the hands of <HI>Pompey</HI> a Pagan Patron.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crassus his sa|criledge.</NOTE> when <HI>Crassus</HI> that rich churl, and <HI>Roman</HI> Generall mar|ching
with his Army into <HI>Syria,</HI> and through <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> flayed, what

talents. Indeed,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ios<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">phus Ant. Iud. li. 4. c. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Eleazar</HI> keeper of the holy treasures, gave, or rather pay|ed
to <HI>Crassus</HI> a wedge of gold weighing three hundred pounds, to ran|some
the rest from his rapine. But the golden wedge did but widen the
covet ousness of <HI>Crassus,</HI> and like a break-fast did inable him to encoun|ter
a dinner with a greater appetite; so that, notwithstanding his oath
to the contrary, he added sacriledge to his perjury. But seeing theeves give
whatever they take not away, we have rather cause to comend his boun|ty,
that the golden table, candlesticks, and other ornaments escaped his
fingers; except, they were either hid from him by the carefull providence
of others, or left by him out of his own politick covetousnes, like nest-egs
to encourage others again to lay up more wealth in the same place. And
no doubt he hoped, though now he had mowed down the Temples trea|sure
to the bare roots, shortly, when grown up again, to return to the
<HI>after-share</HI> thereof; but all in vain, for, marching with his Army into
<HI>Parthia,</HI> there <HI>his money perished with him,</HI> losing the <HI>principle</HI> of his
stoln wealth, and paying his own life for <HI>interest.</HI> Thus, those who on a

do pin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> away by degrees, and die at last of incurable consumptions.</P>

whilest he that <HI>swore by the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mat. 23. 16.</NOTE> gold of the Temple,</HI> was bound up and
concluded in conscience to the performance of his oath. Whereas our Sa|viour
demonstrateth, that <HI>the Temple was greater then the gold,</HI> as the
<HI>sanctifier</HI> thereof. Besides, in common sense, he should seem faster tyed,
whose faith by oath was staked down to the Temple, as to a fixt, firme,
stable structure, then he whose truth was tyed onely to the gold thereof,
a more fading, flitting, moveable matter, as appears by <HI>Crassus</HI> and others
carying so much of it away with him into forein countreys. But indeed
(as our Saviour teacheth) the main obliging power of those oaths, con|sisted
in the presence of God, before whom they were made, who alone
is immoveable and immutable, whereas in process of time, the Temple

I request you to<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Isa. 51. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Look to the rock whence you are

without any honourable addition. What? Had Saint
<HI>Luke</HI> in process of time less civility, or <HI>Theophilus</HI> (with

may be presumed, purposely to wave his titles, out of compli|ance

<P>&sect; 1. _SO much for the <HI>Iewel, Palestine</HI> it self. Now
for the <HI>Case</HI> thereof, namely the neighbour|ing
Countreys which surrounded it. One|ly
herein the <HI>Simile</HI> holds not, because <HI>Cases</HI>
serve, as to compass, so to preserve and de|fend
the Jewell; whereas these bordering
nations were sworn enemies to oppose and
destroy the land and people of <HI>Palestine.</HI> The most quiet neighbour
<HI>Iudea</HI> had, was the <HI>Midland sea</HI> on the west side thereof, which though
sometimes (as the Psalmist observes) <HI>it would rage horribly,</HI> yet generally
it was more peaceable and serviceable then the Pagans, which bounded
them on all other quarters: as namely,

<P><PB N="2" REF="241">
&sect; 2. For the present we are to describe mount <HI>Libanus</HI> or <HI>Lebanon</HI>
with the parts of <HI>Syria</HI> confining thereunto. A mountain which some
will have so named from Frankincense, (<GAP DESC="foreign"> in Greek) whereof
great plenty groweth there. Yet seeing it is usuall for Parents to give
names to their children, not children to their Parents, more probable
it is that Frankincense is called <GAP DESC="foreign"> from this mountain, breeding
store thereof, then that the mountain should be named <HI>Libanus</HI> from
Frankincense growing therein.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. But whilst humane writers are best pleased with this Greek
extraction of <HI>Libanus,</HI> more conformable to Scripture is the Hebrew
Etymology thereof from <HI>Whiteness:</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">In Hebrew White.</NOTE> because the faithfull snow forsakes
not the top of this mountain (no not when persecuted by the Sun in the
dog-days) but remains there all the year long. A pleasant sight, at the
same time to have Winter on the top, and Sommer at the bottome of
one and the same mountain. Excellent the use of this snow in these hot
climats the Prophet<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ier. 18. 14.</NOTE> mentioning it, as most welcome and precious,
<HI>Will a man leave the snow in Lebanon,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Tyrians</HI> and neighbour|ing
nations used to allay and mixe their wines: so making the Torrid
and Frozen <HI>Zone</HI> to meet in the Temperate, more healthfull for their
Constitutions.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. <HI>Lebanon</HI> was a place so pleasant, that an Epicure therein might feed
all his senses to a surfeit.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 <HI>Sight.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pouse saith of<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Cant. 5. 15.</NOTE> Christ, <HI>His countenance is as Lebanon,</HI>
where most delightfull is the prospect, with high hills, humble
dales, sweet rivers, shady groves. No wonder then if <HI>Ptolemy</HI>
placeth <HI>Paradise</HI> a City hereabouts, where what Poets can fan|cy,
Nature hath performed.</ITEM>

Lebanon.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>Hearing.</HI> For besides the melody wrabled forth by the sweet
Choristers of the wood, pleasant it was to listen to the com|plaints
which the Rivers murmuring made against the Rocks,
for wronging them in obstructing their channels: whose com|plaints
therein, were so far from finding pity in mens hearts,
that they onely lulled their heads the sooner and faster as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eep.</ITEM>

mountain affords. <HI>Vinum C.O.S. The sent thereof shall be as the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Hose. 14. 7.</NOTE> wine
of Lebanon. Galen</HI> also reporteth that yearly in mount <HI>Libanus</HI>
husbandmen used to sing, <HI>God raineth hony,</HI> at which time they
spread hides on the ground,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">De alimentis facult. lib. 3. cap. 38.</NOTE> and from the boughs of trees shook
into them the hony dropt from heaven (called there|fore
<HI>mel roscidum &amp; aereum</HI>) filling pots and pitchers with the
same.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="3" REF="241">
No wonder then that <HI>Moses</HI> made it his earnest request to take this
place in his way, to heaven: I<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Deut. 3. 25.</NOTE> <HI>pray thee let me goe over and see the good land,
which is beyond Iordan, that goodly mountain and Lebanon.</HI> As if his soul more
conveniently might <HI>take his rise</HI> from the top thereof to eternall blisse,
and be the better provided to entertain endless happiness, when first he
had sipt some drops of the same in delightfull <HI>Lebanon,</HI> the temporall type
thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. It will perchance be objected against the fertility of this place,
that the Prophet<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Isa. 29. 17.</NOTE> foretelleth, <HI>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be
turned into a fruitfull field?</HI> Where its future conversion into fruitfulness
seemingly implies the present barrenness thereof. But here we must
distinguish betwixt <HI>field</HI> and <HI>forest</HI> fruitfulness. The former is compo|sed
of the concurrence of art and industry with nature; the latter onely
takes what nature tenders, without any toile to improve the same,
wherein <HI>Libanus</HI> already did exceed. But now the Prophet foretells (be|sides
this wild and native) an elaborate and artificiall fertility likely to
befall this mountain, namely in the speedy and universall alteration of
things in <HI>Israel,</HI> when champian fields for fear should be forsaken, and
husbandmen for their security retire with their tillage to mount <HI>Le|banon.</HI>
Thus much for this fair and fruitfull place full of goodly trees,
wild and tame beasts in abundance; and yet when measured by an
infinite majesty,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Isa. 40. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Lebanon is not sufficient for him to burn, nor all the beasts there|of
of sufficient for a burnt offering.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 6. Having largely praised this place (enough to set all the neigh|bouring
Princes at variance about the propriety thereof) it is
now high time to inquire to whom the right thereof did belong. Here
we finde an undoubted evidence, that the same by a double title per|teined
to the land and people of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>1 As a fence to the vineyard. 2 As a Common to a City.
As a fence to a vineyard. So the Prophet in his Parable<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>And be
fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof.</HI> Now although this fen|cing
principally refers to Gods protection over the <HI>Iews,</HI> yet is it not un|appliable
to the naturall posture of their countrey, hem'd in with mount
<HI>Libanus</HI> on the north. Secondly, if we conceive all <HI>Iudea</HI> under the no|tion
of a great city, <HI>Lebanon</HI> was a Common<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 13. 5.</NOTE> assigned thereunto, <HI>and ALL
LEBANON towards the Sunrising.</HI> And though probably the neighbouring
Tribes <HI>Asher, Naphtali,</HI> and <HI>Dan</HI> did reap the most benefit thereby, yet all
the rest are presumed to have a right both in the herbage for their pro|fit,
and wild beasts for their pleasure. However, either with or without
the leave of <HI>Israel,</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 3.3.</NOTE> <HI>Hivites</HI> (and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 10.17.</NOTE> <HI>Archites,</HI> whose city <HI>Archa</HI> is by <HI>Ptole|my</HI>
placed hereabouts) made bold to share with them in the
commodities of this mountain. Here grew the goodly Cedars, of whose
severall kindes, (some bearing fruit without flowers, others bringing
flowers without fruit) manner of growing, having streight and clean
<PB N="4" REF="242">
bodies to the top, and there a tuft of boughs and leaves, (where should
the haire be but on the head?) naturall qualities or supernaturall rather,
(because said to be free from corruption, and therefore used to make
<HI>the statues of the Gods</HI>) the Philosopher<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lin. nat. history.</NOTE> will give the best account, to
whose reports we remit the Reader.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Forget we not that humane writers make a division of the
mountain, calling the northern ledge thereof <HI>Libanus,</HI> the southern <HI>Anti|Libanus</HI>
whereas the Scriptures taking no notice of this distinction, ex|press
both under the generall name of <HI>Libanus.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 8. And now to climbe this mountain, behold it every where scat|tered
with <HI>Solomons</HI> workmen, some bearing of burdens, (Better to car|ry
the meanest materiall to the Temple of God, then carve the most cu|rious
pieces for the tower of <HI>Babel</HI>) some hewing of stones, all busied,
either with their hands as labourers, or eyes as overseers. No hole left
for idleness to peep in at, but presently she was perceived and punished.
I hope without offence, one may wish them <HI>God speed,</HI> the rather be|cause
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Psal. 74. 6, 7.</NOTE> he <HI>that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, was known to bring it to
an excellent work, but now they break down all the work thereof with axes and
hammers.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 9. It is now high time that leaving the generall description of <HI>Li|banus</HI>
we come to survay the severall places on, or near thereunto. In the
southwest side thereof near <HI>Zidon,</HI> and the sea, lay the land of <HI>Cabul,</HI>
which <HI>Solomon</HI> gave to <HI>Hiram King of Tyre</HI> for the cost and charge he was
at in building the Temple. Hereby it appears that this territory (though
lying in<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">1 King. 9. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Galilee</HI> was no part of the <HI>Land of Canaan,</HI> it being above the
power of the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> to alienate any parcell thereof. But though
it was unlawfull <HI>to take the childrens bread, and cast it unto dogs,</HI> yet the crust
and parings thereof might be given them: to which this Land of <HI>Cabul</HI>
may well be compared, being so course and base a Countrey, that it little
contented King <HI>Hiram,</HI> who therefore called it<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 King. 9. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Cabul,</HI> that is <HI>dirty,</HI> or <HI>displea|sing.</HI>
It may seem strange that <HI>Solomon,</HI> who in other things consulted
with his honour and magnificence and <HI>to whom God gave a large heart,</HI>
should herein have so narrow a hand, as not to give <HI>Hiram</HI> a friend and
forein Prince full consideration, who so freely had furnished him
with all necessaries for his building. But
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Haply <HI>Solomon</HI> beheld <HI>Hiram</HI> as a Homager unto him, holding
the kingdome of <HI>Tyre</HI> from the Crown of <HI>Israel.</HI> And if so, then
all he did was but his duty, and fully rewarded in <HI>Solomons</HI> favou|rable
acceptance thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>Solomon</HI> might conceive <HI>Hirams</HI> expences sufficiently satisfied in
allowing his men such a vast<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1 King. 5. 11. 2 Chron. 2. 10.</NOTE> proportion of yearly provision:
so these cities were given him not in compensation of the charge,
but as an overplus and meer gratuity. For which <HI>Hiram</HI> ought
to be thankfull because so good, not displeased because no better.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="242">
3 Most probable it is, that absolute need, and no other reason,
made <HI>Solomon</HI> fall short, in satisfying <HI>Hirams</HI> expectation. His
treasure being much exhausted (excess will begger wealth it self)
by his sumptuous structures. The same necessitous principles,
which caused his intolerable taxes on his own people, might
also make him (against his own will, and generous disposition)
faile in rewarding the full deserts of <HI>Hiram.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is some contentment unto us, that though we know not the seve|rall
names, yet the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 King. 9. 11.</NOTE> Scripture acquaints us with the exact number of the
cities in <HI>Cabul-land:</HI> being twenty in all, as in our Map, we have recko|ned
them accordingly.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. But here some will be very much startled, that this land of
<HI>Cabul</HI> should so lately receive this denomination from <HI>Hirams</HI> displea|sure,
whereas we finde it so called four hundred years before in the book
of <HI>Ioshua,</HI> where the borders of the Tribe of <HI>Asher,</HI> are thus assigned:
they <HI>goe out to<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 19. 27.</NOTE> Cabul on the left hand.</HI> To satisfie which seeming difficul|ty,
we must know, that though the book of <HI>Ioshua</HI> contains matter of
far more ancient date,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Josh. 10. 13.</NOTE> yet it was written by <HI>holy-men of God</HI> after the days
of <HI>David,</HI> and probably in the reign of <HI>Solomon.</HI> This appears because in
<HI>Ioshua</HI> mention is made of the book of <HI>Iasher,</HI> wherein the standing still
of the Sun and Moon was recorded, and that book of <HI>Iasher</HI> was pen|ned
after <HI>Davids</HI> reign, because therein <HI>Davids</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 1. 18.</NOTE> acts were also Chro|nicled.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. Mount <HI>Libanus</HI> is overspread with the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 King. 9. 19. &amp; 2 Chr. 8. 6.</NOTE> <HI>buildings of Solomon,</HI>
whereof some may be conceived the fragments made out of the Rem|nants
and Reversions of the stone and timber left of what was provi|ded
for the Temple. Yea probably some were platformes and modells
to heighten and improve the skill and knowledge of his builders. True
it is, in the making of the Tabernacle, every <HI>Tenon, board, hook</HI> and <HI>socket</HI>
were <HI>Iure Divino,</HI> both by precept and precedent, according to the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 5.</NOTE> <HI>pat|tern
in the Mount:</HI> but it was not so in the building of the Temple. There|in,
God gave <HI>Solomon</HI> a <HI>large heart,</HI> and furnished him with <HI>Hiram</HI> a
skilfull workman: but as for all particular proportions, they were left
at large for their wisdomes to contrive. It may therefore with much
likelyhood be conceived, that to better their knowledge in Architecture
for the Temple some slight buildings in <HI>Libanon</HI> were erected, which
afterwards might serve <HI>Solomon</HI> for privacy, and pleasure, retirement, and
recreation. And seeing <HI>Solomon</HI> took his naturall history <HI>from the Cedar
that growes in Lebanon, to the Moss on the wall,</HI> haply he might study in some
of these buildings, where <HI>Cedars,</HI> and other simples were presented unto
him, being best able to comment on Natures works when he saw the
text before his eyes. Of these buildings in <HI>Libanus</HI> that tower <HI>which<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Cant. 7. 4.</NOTE>
looks towards Damascus</HI> was the principal, to which the Nose of the Spouse
in the <HI>Canticles</HI> is compared, for the whiteness, uniformity, and pro|portionable
<PB N="6" REF="243">
largeness thereof, whereby the generousness and animosity
of the Church is intimated. The<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Arist. in libro physiognomico.</NOTE> <HI>Philosopher</HI> telleth us that a tower-fashi|oned
Nose (round and blunt at the top) is a signe of magnanimity.</P>
<P>&sect; 12. From this tower we may take the Prospect of all the adjacent
countrey: wherein we take no notice of the division of <HI>Syria</HI> according to
humane writers, but confine our selves to Scripture expressions.</P>

<P>&sect; 17. Wonder not that the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI> ruling over the world,
should suffer some Kings to reign under them: which was their con|stant
practise, and whereby they received no small benefit. For first,
hereby they kept their people in more willing obedience, when they
saw their former government not wholly altered, but some shadow
thereof still remaining in their Kings continued amongst them. Se|condly,
when any distastfull project was set on foot, the Emperours used
these Kings to promote it: so casting the odium upon them, which
themselves declined, while such<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Vetus ac jam pridem recept a populi Romani consuetudo, ut habcret instru|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">enta servit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tis &amp; reges.

Kings homagers thereunto. It is but a <HI>Farme</HI> (though of never so great
revenues) and not reputed a <HI>Manor,</HI> which hath not some free-holders
holding of it, and owing <HI>suit and service</HI> unto it. Semblably it was part

should be bewitched with the delightfulness thereof, and hindred from
the great work he had in hand. I indeed perceive that so pleasant a sub|ject
hath too long retarded my pen, almost forgetfull to goe forward

<P>&sect; 21. <HI>Aram-Zobah</HI> lay north-east of <HI>Aram-Damascus. Hadadezar</HI> or
<HI>Hadarezar</HI> was King thereof, so glorious a Prince, that his servants wore
shields of gold in war, as if they intended to dazle their enemies eyes
with the splendor of their armes; but all in vain. For the best swords
of steel will command the bravest shield of gold: and <HI>David</HI> at <HI>Elam,</HI>
got an absolute conquest of him, killing<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 10. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Shobach</HI> his Captain, as for|merly
<PB N="10" REF="245">
he had<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 8. 4.</NOTE> defeated him and stript him of much rich spoile. As for
those golden shields, they fell not to the shares of any private persons,
but were treasured up by <HI>David</HI> for the building of the Temple, where
this glorious Plate shined in its proper sphear; and where Riot, and
Luxury abused by man, was converted into well grounded bounty,
as bestowed on Gods service. Here <HI>David</HI> houghed the horses of <HI>Hada|dezar,</HI>
and onely reserved an hundred<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 8. 4.</NOTE> chariots of them as a Trophee
of triumph to be used for state at publick solemnities.</P>
<P>&sect; 22. Some will censure this as an improvident and unpolitick act,
and character <HI>David</HI> as more happy to get, then able to use a victory;
not casually letting slip, but wilfully casting <HI>such a power of horse</HI> out of
his hand, which managed with a proportionable infantry, might have
given Law to all the east Countrey. Surely it was not done out of a
cowardly suspicion, lest the <HI>Syrians</HI> should recover those horses again;
much less out of consciousness of want of horsemanship in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
to set riders upon them: Rather it was, that <HI>David</HI> being privy to the
deceitfulness of mans heart (how hard it was to have much humane
strength, and not to have confidence in it) did it to wean his subjects
from <HI>the arme of flesh,</HI> that they might more rely on divine protection.
And he did it, to encourage in them, what properly is called <HI>Manhood:</HI>
that they might not expect victories of equivocall generation begotten
betwixt men and horses, but such atchieved onely by mans prowess,
instrumentall to get, and Gods providence, the principall to give them.
Yea <HI>David</HI> might seem to have houghed all the horses in the world, with
that his short, but sharp sentence, <HI>A<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 17.</NOTE> horse is but a vaine thing to save a
man.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 23. It will further be objected, that grant these horses not to be
used in the wars of <HI>Israel,</HI> yet what needs this wast to spoile Gods good
creatures? Might they not have been sold for many talents and given to
the poor? It is answered, that <HI>David</HI> did it in an holy <HI>Brave,</HI> to shew
that the Pagans pride, was <HI>Israels</HI> scorn, and that he as much disdained to
gain wealth by the sale, as to get strength by the service of those horses.
Besides, <HI>David</HI> herein did follow the precept given to, and pressed and
practised by<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 11. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Ioshua</HI> in the like case. And indeed multiplying of horses
was<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Deut. 17. 19.</NOTE> forbidden the Kings of <HI>Israel.</HI> But after <HI>Davids</HI> days the Militia
was much altered and managed by horse; by the way, <HI>Absalom</HI> was the
first <HI>Israelite,</HI> whom we finde riding in a chariot, and how he was blest
is not unknown: Afterwards <HI>Solomon</HI> brought many horses out of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and an Egyptian wife on the back of them, who certainly hin|dred
more, then the other helped him; and generally the <HI>Israelites</HI> were
more prosperous before their use of horses, then ever after; Their suc|cess
was mounted when they fought on foot, but scarce went on foot
when their armies were mounted on horseback.</P>
<P>&sect; 24. But to return to <HI>Aram-Zobath:</HI> Two prime cities thereof with
<PB N="11" REF="245">
four names are mentioned in Scripture,<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 8. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Beta,</HI> and <HI>Berothat,</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 18. 8.</NOTE> elsewhere
called <HI>Tibhah</HI> and <HI>Chun.</HI> Here (not to say that <HI>Beta</HI> and <HI>Tibhah</HI> by Meta|thesis
are the same) it is no newes for cities standing in the confines of
severall kingdomes, and the juncture of severall languages to have dou|ble
names. What the English-man calls <HI>Glocester</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> the
Welsh-men tearm<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rey Lhuyd in de|scrip. Walliae.</NOTE> <HI>Caer Loyw</HI> and <HI>Caer-Frangon.</HI> And probably one of
the names of these cities was <HI>Hebrew</HI> and the other <HI>Aramite.</HI> Both of
them afforded much brass<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 8. 8.</NOTE> to King <HI>David</HI> (Gods receiver generall for
that purpose) for the building of the Temple. But <HI>Zobah</HI> which gave
the name to this Countrey is generally conceived at this day to be called
<HI>Aleppo,</HI> (though some <HI>Iews</HI> inhabiting therein count it anciently the
city of <HI>Sepharvaim</HI>) from <HI>Alep</HI> which signifies<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Biddulphs travels pa. 45.</NOTE> <HI>milke</HI> in the Turkish
language; whereof such plenty here, that if <HI>via lactea</HI> be to be found
on earth, it is in this place. It is so seated on a navigable stream which
runs into <HI>Euphrates,</HI> that here the commodities of the East and West doe
meet. The former from <HI>Babylon</HI> by water, the latter by <HI>Land-caravans</HI>
from <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> and this city is the golden clasp to couple both sides of
the world together, and we remit the Reader to modern Merchants for
further information thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 25. And here standing on the utmost verge of our map we could
wish it of such extent as might represent to the Reader <HI>Aram-Naharam</HI>
or <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> (otherwise <HI>Padan-Aram</HI>) where <HI>Bethuel</HI> and <HI>Laban</HI> dwelt;
<HI>Charran,</HI> whither <HI>Abraham</HI> first removed; <HI>Caldea</HI> and <HI>Ur,</HI> a city where he
formerly dwelt; <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Nineveh,</HI> the two Emperesses of the world,
with the rivers which watered and bounded Paradise it self. But alass,
as Prodigalls who have spent their possessions take little delight to see
a survey of the lands they have sold, (the sad remembrancer of their for|mer
riot and present wretchedness) so small comfort can accrew un|to
us by the curious enquiry into the ancient place of Paradise, having
long since in our first Parents forfeited all our right and title thereunto.
But the main matter forbidding our Pens progress any further, is be|cause,
as <HI>Shimei</HI> confined by <HI>Solomon</HI> to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> suffered justly as an offen|der
for gadding to<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 King. 2. 44.</NOTE> <HI>Gath:</HI> so <HI>Palestine</HI> with the neighbouring countreys
being the proper subject of our discourse, we shall be taken trespassers,
if found wandering beyond the bounds thereof. However I hope
without offence my hand may point further then my feet may follow,
and tell the Reader that the fore-named places lie northeast of the city
of <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 26. The land of <HI>Hamah</HI> lay west of <HI>Aram-Zobah,</HI> anciently inha|bited
by the <HI>Hamathites,</HI> descended from the eleventh and youngest Son
of <HI>Canaan</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. 10. 18.</NOTE> the Son of <HI>Cham,</HI> of whom largely before. In the days of <HI>David
Toi</HI> was King of this Countrey, who being at war with <HI>Hadadezar,</HI> and
hearing how the <HI>Israelites</HI> had defeated him, sent<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">2 S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m. 8. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Ioram</HI> his Son to King
<HI>David</HI> with presents in his hand and complements in his mouth,
<PB N="12" REF="246">
to congratulate his victory. Long after <HI>Salmaneser</HI> subdued this coun|trey
and extinguished the royall race; witness that brag: <HI>Where is the
King of Hamath<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Esa. 37. 13.</NOTE> and of Arpad?</HI> Though that proud question admits of
an answer; namely, <HI>they were even there, where their sins set them:</HI> seeing it was
not so much the <HI>Assyrian</HI> valour, as the <HI>Syrian</HI> wickedness which cast these
Kings out of their countrey. <HI>Riblah</HI> was a prime city in this land,
where <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> caused the eyes of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 25. 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>Zedekiah</HI> to be bored out.
Some conceive this done in the land of <HI>Nephtali,</HI> others with more like|lihood
in this place, and we (see Reader our carefulness to please all
if possible in this captious age) mention it in both. Yet because this
<HI>Riblah</HI> was many miles nearer to <HI>Babylon,</HI> and further from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> it
is more probable to be the place, as more for <HI>Nebuchadnezzars</HI> ease and
<HI>Zedekiahs</HI> anguish: it adding to the conquerours state to fetch the cap|tive
furthest from his own countrey.</P>
<P>&sect; 27. <HI>Hamah</HI> the city which gave the name to this countrey, was af|terwards
called <HI>Antiochia.</HI> Seven and twenty cities are said to be of the
same name. For severall <HI>Antiochuses</HI> being successively Kings of <HI>Syria,</HI>
stocked their dominions with many cities after their names, as being
either built, beautified, strengthened or enlarged by them, or their Fa|vorites.
But it matters not how many younger brethren there be of the
same family, as long as our <HI>Antioch</HI> is the heire, and though not in age, in
honour to be preferred before all the rest. Here the professor of the Go|spell
formerly termed <HI>Beleevers</HI> for their faith, sometimes <HI>Brethren</HI> for
their love, <HI>Saints</HI> for their <HI>holinesse, Disciples</HI> for their knowledg, were for
all these first called<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Act. 11. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Christians.</HI> Probably when many of all nations be|leeved,
the name <HI>Christian</HI> was given them, to bury the difference be|twixt
<HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> (thus <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> happily joined in <HI>great
Britain</HI>) which two names though remaining afterwards, were used
as terms of civill difference, not odious distinction. Had this happened
at <HI>Rome,</HI> how would the Tide of <HI>Tiber</HI> have swoln above all his bounds
and banks at the conceit that in her city Religion it self was christened?
But this <HI>Antioch</HI> hath still more to brag of: The <HI>Chair of Saint Peter,</HI> where|in
he sate Patriarch many years before his removeall to <HI>Rome:</HI> and there|fore
no wonder if <HI>Antioch</HI> grudge to give <HI>Rome</HI> the superiority. Why
should not that place be the prime, which was the first? Besides, Saint
<HI>Peter</HI> was honoured at <HI>Antioch,</HI> murdered at <HI>Rome.</HI> And why should
that City receive most credit by him, which used most cruelty unto him?
But let Ecclesiasticall Heralds deduce the pedegree, and martiall the pre|cedency
of these Churches, we will onely adde, that this Pharisaicall
<HI>taking of the upper-hand,</HI> hath in all ages hindered the <HI>giving of the right hand
of Christian fellowship.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 28. Now surely no malignant quality in this place, but a principle
of perversness in mens hearts was the cause, that so many famous con|tentions
happened in this city of <HI>Antioch.</HI> Here it was, that some <HI>com|ming

Judaisme and Christianity. This occasioned the calling of the first
great Councell in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which in fine concluded that this legall Yoke
was not to be laid on the neck of Christians. Here <HI>Peter</HI> being guilty
(it is the expression of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">In his Epistle to the Cardi|nall of <HI>Loraine</HI> prefixed before his translation of Chrysostome on the Galati|ans.</NOTE> <HI>Erasmus</HI>) of <HI>superstitious dissimulation,</HI> with his ex|ample
(oh the impulsive power of great mens Precedents!) brought
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gal. 2. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Barnabas</HI> into the same fault: for which Saint <HI>Paul</HI> presently and pub|lickly
reproved him. But we will not widen the wounds in good
mens memories, rather commending to posterity, the holy zeale of
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> in seasonable giving, the humble piety of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> in pati|ent
taking so sharp a reproof.</P>
<P>&sect; 29. But the greatest contention happening here, was that <HI>Paroxysme</HI>
betwixt <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> the one as earnestly refusing, as the other
desiring the company of <HI>Iohn Mark</HI> to goe along with them. In which
contest, <HI>Paul</HI> is generally conceived to have most reason, <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nabas</HI> most
passion on his side, because
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 He saw clearly without carnall relation, whilest <HI>Barnabas</HI> beheld
<HI>Mark</HI> his<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Colos. 4. 10.</NOTE> sisters son through the spectacles of naturall affection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 A reason is rendred by <HI>Paul</HI> why <HI>Markes</HI> company should be
declined, namely, because he<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Act. 15. 58.</NOTE> departed from them at <HI>Pamphilia</HI>
and deserted the work, none alledged by <HI>Barnabas</HI> why the same
should be accepted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 <HI>Paul</HI> immediately departing after this contention is said to<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Act. 15. 46.</NOTE> <HI>be re|commended
by the brethren to the grace of God,</HI> which seems to amount
to a generall approbation of his carriage herein. No such pas|sage
appears of <HI>Barnabas.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4 After this time Saint <HI>Paul</HI> and his acts are celebrated in every
Chapter, whereas <HI>Barnabas</HI> sinks here in silence, and his name
mentioned no more in the history of the Scripture.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But we must admire Gods wisdome in mans weakness, sanctifying
this discord to his glory. For whilest <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were newly
converted, and their company needfull for mutuall assistance each to o|ther,
their persons and affections were united together: but now
grown strong in grace, and able singly to subsist, God suffered this un|happy
difference to sever them. Whereby the <HI>Gospell</HI> encreased, the one
sailing to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the other staying in <HI>Syria.</HI> So whereas formerly one
place at the same time did jointly enjoy them; now there became two
Flockes, two shepheards, two vines, two vinedressers, and the division
of Preachers proved the multiplication of preaching.</P>
<P>&sect; 30. We must not forget how one <HI>Nicolas</HI> a Proselyte of this city of
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Act. 6. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Antioch,</HI> was the last of the seven Deacons, and the first founder of an

lie with her; with some other strange opinions he maintained. Those
therefore who so undiscreetly express their detestation of one sin, that
they fall foul on the committing of the contrary, may by a spirituall
proportion be accounted mysticall <HI>Nicolaitans.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 31. There was also belonging to <HI>Antioch</HI> (pardon a little digressi|on)
a delicious suburb called <HI>Daphne,</HI> where <HI>Apollo Daphneus</HI> was adored.
Now (some three hundred sixty years after Christ) <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostate, the
professed enemy to piety, sacrificed hereto this <HI>Devill-God,</HI> who used to be
very talkative in giving of Oracles, but lately was grown very mute. And
being demanded the reason of his suddain silence answered (forsooth)
it was because the body of <HI>Babylas</HI> (martyred under <HI>Decius</HI> the Empe|rour)
was buried near his Temple, the vertue whereof stopped his
wind-pipe. Hereupon a conceit was taken that other Martyrs bones
might be found upon triall as terrible to the devill, which gave the<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">See M. Meade in his Aposta|sieof the latter times. pag. 122.</NOTE>
first occasion to the enshrining, worshipping, and circumgestation of
the Reliques of Saints. See how <HI>Satan</HI> (much delighted in his apish
Parallels of divine service) was ambitious, that a dominative point
of Antichristianisme should have its originall in the same place where
the name of Christianity first began. But long since <HI>Antioch</HI> hath smarted
for this superstition and her other sins; reduced at this day to a petty
village, (standing in the rode betwixt <HI>Scanderoon</HI> and <HI>Aleppo</HI>) and <HI>Orontes</HI>
the river thereof once navigable, (Saint <HI>Paul</HI> is said to have<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Act. 14. 26.</NOTE> sailed to
<HI>Antioch</HI>) much obstructed with sand, and more profitable for good <HI>Eeles</HI>

miserably ruinous. But seeing silkes, though ragged, may be worn
with the less discredit; the torn and tattered edifices in <HI>Antioch</HI> seem no
disgrace, because most of them are made of rich stuffe, even costly mar|ble
curiously polished.</P>

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF

EDOM. CHAP. 2.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. _BEfore we come to the particular description of
the Countreys, something for satisfaction; why
<HI>Midian</HI> first, and why <HI>Midian</HI> and <HI>Moab</HI> together.
In giving <HI>Midian</HI> the Precedency, we observe se|niority,
he being extracted from <HI>Abraham</HI> the
uncle, by <HI>Keturah</HI> his wife, whilest <HI>Moab</HI> came
from <HI>Lot</HI> the nephew, by his own daughter. As for putting them toge|ther,
we are loath to confess our poverty, that lack of larger instructions
to furnish forth severall Maps, was any cause of our conjoining them
together. The main motive is not onely the vicinity of their habitation,
but also correspondency of severall atchievements betwixt them, which
makes them often coupled together in Scripture. Thus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 35. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Hadad King
of Edom smote Midian in the field of Moab.</HI> The Elders of <HI>Moab</HI> and<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Numb. 22. 7.</NOTE> the El|ders

of <HI>Moab</HI> and the daughters of <HI>Midian</HI> enticed the <HI>Israelites</HI> to whoredome
and Idolatry.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. <HI>Midian</HI> consisted of two families: one seated southward near the
<HI>Red-sea,</HI> serving the true God, (not so purely but with the mixture of su|perstitions)
where <HI>Iethro Moses</HI> his father-in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">law lived, of whom (God
willing) hereafter. The other Idolaters, planted more eastward; the
subject of our present discourse. This distance of place and difference of
Religions gave probability to their opinions, who fancy them two
distinct nations, which is seemingly confirmed, because the former is
called <HI>Madian</HI> in the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 7. 29.</NOTE> new Testament. But though in some cases we con|fess
that the difference of a letter, may make more then a literall diffe|rence,
yet here it is not enough to make a reall distinction: seeing He|brew
words made Greek often suffer greatermutations then of a vowell,
<HI>Midian</HI> into <HI>Madian.</HI> Others are startled, because the <HI>Midianites</HI> are<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Gen. 37. 25. 27, 28. 39. Iudg. 8. 22. 24. 26.</NOTE> some|times

<PB N="20" REF="252">
from <HI>Keturah.</HI> But it is probable (surely such as reject our conjecture
will substitute a better in the room thereof) that because <HI>Ishmael</HI> was
the eldest son of <HI>Abraham,</HI> chief of the house, all those eastern people de|scended
from <HI>Abraham</HI> were denominated by the genericall name of
<HI>Ishmaelites.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. It is as difficult precisely to define the bounds, as impossible
compleatly to describe the Countrey of <HI>Midian.</HI> For besides the mixture
and conjunction (not to say confusion) of these eastern people, interfe|ring
amongst themselves in their habitations, the <HI>Midianites</HI> especially led
erraticall lives, and therefore had uncertain limits. They dwelt most in
tents, which we may call <HI>moving towns,</HI> and <HI>extempore cities,</HI> set up in a
few houres, and in fewer taken down and dissolved. Next morning
oft times found them many miles off, from the place where last night
left them. And if we wonder at the wildness of their wandring, and
rudeness of their roving abroad, they will admire as much at the stilness
of our station, and dulness of our constant dwelling in one place. And
no doubt they observed a method in their removalls, as there is a regu|larity
as well in the motion of the Planets, as of the fixed Stars.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. For the generall we dare avouch they had <HI>Reuben</HI> and <HI>Gad</HI> on the

out of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> they betook not themselves southward (and
surely such Foxes when hunted would hast home to their own kennels)
but ran through the Tribe of <HI>Gad</HI> full east, to their proper habitations.
But now what a slender account shall we make of the towns and places
in <HI>Midian?</HI> But I conceive it better to present the Reader with a map
without cities, or those cities without names, then those names without
truth, or at least wise that truth without certainty, and a fair blank is to
be preferred before a full paper blurred over with falshoods.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. But first we doe behold those castles; and cities of <HI>Midian</HI> all on a

no<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Num. 31. 49.</NOTE> one man slain in the action) wherein they killed all the males of
that countrey and females which had known man. What time also

conquered this countrey possessed not themselves and their heirs thereof.
Let such know, first, that this sandy land was barren it self, whose best
fruitfulness consisted onely in the largeness thereof: Secondly, God in|tended
an entire territory to his own people, whereas this stragling
Countrey was hardly kept, though easily conquered: Thirdly, the
<HI>Midianites</HI> were of the halfe bloud with the <HI>Israelites,</HI> descended from <HI>A|braham,</HI>
and therefore God would not have them disinherit their kinsmen
of their possessions.</P>

though their coverings might seem course, their courtains (mentioned

a week together. He hath but one bunch on his back (the Camell having
more) the naturall saddle for his Rider to mount upon, generally more
used for travell then bearing of burdens, and of as much more refined
service above Camells, as Hacknies are above Packhorses. In a word,
as in one respect this beast is the commendable character of perseve|rance,
not fleet by fits, at the first; but holding out a constant and equall
tenour in travelling: so in another regard, it may pass for the emblem of
hypocrisie, pretending to both symptomes of a clean beast, really chew|ing

their siege: either out of policy, perceiving the same desperate, and
unlikely to prevaile; or out of a royall sympathy, that it was revenge e|nough
to distress, though not destroy a King or (which is most proba|ble)
out of a religious horrour (the trembling whereat made their

any further to such impious, and unhumane performances; lest heaven

perchance it is so termed from the extraordinary populousness thereof,
<HI>Waters</HI> being often used for <HI>People</HI> in Scripture phrase, both being at all
times unstable and unconstant, and when they get a head implacable,
neither speaking nor hearing reason; both usefull servants, but intolera|ble

that his men were mightier then they were, yet we may presume
this bed of <HI>Og</HI> was not unproportionably greater then he necessarily
used for his ordinary repose. No doubt <HI>Og</HI> confident of his own strength
certainly concluded, that as he did often lie in health upon that bed, so
he should quietly die on the same, whereas contrary to his expectation
he was slain in the field, and now his bed served him for a <HI>Cenotaph</HI> or

engaged in battell was killed, though not conquered, by the treacherous

courage rather to die then to fly, concurred to hasten his own
destruction. Afterwards <HI>Ioab</HI> having brought the city to terms of yeeld|ing,
politickly sends for <HI>David</HI> solemnly to take his place, to decline all
envy from himself, and invest all honour on his Soveraign. Here the

when <HI>Minnith</HI> was<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Iudg. 11. 33.</NOTE> undoubtedly a city of the <HI>Ammonites;</HI> it is answered.
1 This fine wheat might first be denominated from <HI>Minnith</HI> as origi|nally
growing there, though afterwards as good and more of that kind
grew generally in <HI>Iudea.</HI> Thus some flowers, and fruits, <HI>Province-Roses,
Burgamo peares &amp;c.</HI> are as full and fair in other countreys as in that
place whence they take their name. 2 By <HI>Minnith-wheat</HI> may be meant,
wheat winnowed, cleansed, and dressed after the fine and curious
fashion of <HI>Minnith.</HI> Thus they are called <HI>Hungar-dollars,</HI> which are re|fined
to the standard of <HI>Hungarian</HI> gold, in what place or by what Prince

<P>&sect; 30. <HI>Esau</HI> eldest Son of <HI>Isaac</HI> was <HI>red and hairy</HI> at his birth; the one

highly beloved of his Father (whilest <HI>Iacob</HI> was Gods and his Mothers
darling) chiefly for providing him<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 25. 28.</NOTE> Venison: a consideration beneath

Coming one day hungry from hunting he sold his birthright to his bro|ther
<HI>Iacob</HI> for<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Gen. 25. 30.</NOTE> red pottage, <HI>red</HI> being <HI>Edom</HI> in Hebrew. I confess many

<LIST>
<ITEM>1 It was no faire but fraudulent dealing for <HI>Iacob</HI> to surprize his

<P>Wherefore it is safest to turn all our excusing of <HI>Iacob</HI> into our admi|ring
of Gods wisdome, who makes mens crooked actions to tend in a
streight line to his own glory. And yet we must not forget, that even after
<HI>Esau</HI> had satisfied himself with food, the text saith, <HI>Thus</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 25. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Esau despised his
birthright.</HI> It seems thereby, that what his hast and hunger had conveyed
his profaneness did deliberately confirme, and by that his neglect and
contempt, <HI>he acknowledged a Fine,</HI> cutting off his heires from any recovery
thereof. Indeed afterwards <HI>Esau</HI> made it a main matter of<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gen. 27. 36.</NOTE> quarrell with
his brother, but never a matter of conscience in himself. But enough
hereof: onely I will adde the crossing of the common rule, <HI>Caveat ven|ditor,</HI>
let here <HI>the seller beware,</HI> for God took <HI>Esau</HI> at his word, and accor|dingly deprived him of his birthright.</P>
<P>&sect; 31. But <HI>Esau</HI> set a greater valuation on his <HI>Blessing,</HI> wherein be|ing

<HI>kindely showre of repentance,</HI> but onely some heate drops of anger and in|dignation, not so much grieved that he had lost, as vexed that <HI>Iacob</HI> had
gotten the <HI>Blessing.</HI> At last his importunity got from his Father a <HI>Blessing</HI>
though not <HI>the blessing,</HI> the severall clauses whereof we are seriously to
consider, because thereon dependeth the right understanding of the con|ditions
of the people and countrey of <HI>Edom,</HI> which we are now to de|scribe.</P>
<Q>Behold<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gen. 27. 39.</NOTE> thy dwelling shall be the fatnesse of the earth, and

In the former it signified Gods favour with an undoubted right unto,
and sanctified use of divine promises, service and Sacraments: whereas
in this blessing of <HI>Esau, heavenly dew,</HI> was in effect, but earthly dew, tempo|rall
terrestriall fertility allowed to this mountainous land of <HI>Edom,</HI> whose

on the east, the wilderness of <HI>Paran</HI> on the north-west, and the <HI>Red-sea</HI>
on the south-west. A sea not so called from the redness of the water

it seems was the sum paid <HI>de claro</HI> into the Kings Exchequer, otherwise

plainly told me, that the winds and the waves forbad the Banes of
matching Gods children with Idolaters in the same designe. Yea the
breath of <HI>Eliezer</HI> the Prophet, may be said to have sunk those ships, threa|tening
their destruction. Thus those shall never reap good harvest,
who plow with an Oxe and an Asse, contrary to Gods flat<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Deut. 22. 10.</NOTE> command.
Afterwards, wicked King <HI>Ahaziah</HI> requested again of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 King. 22. 49.</NOTE> <HI>Let my
servants goe with thy servants in the ships,</HI> but the other refused, having foundas
bad success with the son at sea, as lately he had had on land with <HI>Ahab</HI> his
Father. Besides, <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> being sensible how his infant-designe was
strangled in the wombe, and his ships broken at <HI>Ezion gaber</HI> in the very
haven, would not renew his voyage, it being a bold defying of divine
power, to water that project from earth, which one plainly sees blasted
from heaven.</P>

Heroes, that mens laziness takes a more compendious way, in stead
of imitating their virtues, practise to abolish their persons. And
yet what clearer demonstration can there be of the historicall truth of
<HI>Iob,</HI> then that his own name, the name of the place of his dwelling
are set down, with the names of his foes, friends, and daughters; and
the whole History as largely recorded in the <HI>old,</HI> as briefly repeated

who lessen <HI>Iobs</HI> sufferings, because he lost nothing with in doors, his
Coin, Jewels, Plate, and houshold-stuffe (presumed in a conside|rable
equipage to the rest of his substance) remained entire for any
thing we finde to the contrary. But the wealth of that age chiefly
consisted in their stock, so that one may call their cattell their coin,

double to him:<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Iob 42. 10.</NOTE> so that it had been better for him to have lost more;
for then he should have had twice as much restored: onely the same
number of children were given him, seven sons and three daughters,
because his former children, <HI>non amissi, sed praemissi,</HI> were not foregone,
but gone before. Parents may account on their pious children depar|ted,
and reckon, not that once they had, but still have them; though not

<P>&sect; 41. Here I omit the Countrey of <HI>Temah</HI> with some other petty ter|ritories,

edge of this Map, and there smell the fragrancies of <HI>Arabia the happy,</HI> so
called on good reason. <HI>Misers</HI> measure Paradise by their profit, <HI>Epicures</HI>
by their pleasure: both met here. And it is hard to say whether the
<HI>spices</HI> or the <HI>gold</HI> of the countrey are more renowned. But if heaven
should commence an action against <HI>Arabia the happy</HI> for usurping his
priviledge, <HI>Arabia</HI> would <HI>non-sute</HI> it self, and confess her unhappiness in
the midst of all her felicity. For in default of other fuell they are fain
to burn and dress their meat with Aromaticall wood, which so stupefi|eth
the senses of the people, that they are forced with<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Plim. lib. 12. cap. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Bitumen</HI> and the
sent of <HI>Goates</HI> (where perfumes are too frequent, a stink is a perfume)
to qualifie their suffocating sweetness. Thus no heaven out of heaven,
and no earthly felicity will fall out even measure to content us, but either
too much or too little.</P>

the land of <HI>Edom.</HI> Hence <HI>Moses</HI> sent messengers to request a peaceable
passage through the kingdome of <HI>Edom,</HI> but could not obtain it. No
doubt they were jealous of <HI>Israels</HI> greatness, and being carnally suspici|ous
of them (because Power generally performeth promises, no further
then it complies with its profit) conceived it easier to keep, then cast
them out of their countrey. If<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 32. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Iacob</HI> was frighted with <HI>Esau's</HI> coming
to meet him with four hundred men, <HI>Esau</HI> was now no less afraid of
<HI>Iacob</HI> accosting him with six hundred thousand men.</P>
<P>&sect; 43. However, God commanded his people not to force this, but
finde another passage. It was well more ways then one led to <HI>Canaan,</HI>
else <HI>Israel</HI> had been at a losse. But wicked men may for a time retard, not
finally obstruct our access to happiness. It is but fetching a compass,
making two steps for one; a little more pains and patience will doe the
deed. <HI>Israel</HI> surrounds the land of <HI>Edom,</HI> and next sets down at <HI>Zal|mona.</HI></P>

his Person, and the manner of his Passion, he <HI>must be lifted up. Zalmona</HI>

<P>&sect; 26. No doubt the <HI>Israelites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iews</HI> Ido|latty.</NOTE> at the giving of the Law, made large

<HI>Moses</HI> his absence fourty days in the Mount, they solicited <HI>Aaron to make
them Gods.</HI> He to decline the imployment, requires the<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Exod. 32. 2.</NOTE> ear-rings (not
out of the cabinets, but) from the eares of their <HI>wives, sons, and daughters.</HI>
Hoping, this his motion would make such a generall mutiny in all
their families, it would finally dash the designe. Especially, seeing
golden ornaments were accounted essentiall in those Eastern parts, and
their heads, and hands being without ear-rings, and bracelets, were e|steemed
more naked, then ours without hats, and gloves. But <HI>Aaron</HI>
herein missed his marke, finding the <HI>Iews</HI> superstition above their pride,
or covetousness, who violently <HI>brake</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ibid. v. 3.</NOTE> <HI>off</HI> their ear-rings, even such as
were riveted in their skin with long wearing, so that rather they would
fetch away some flesh, then leave any gold behinde them. Of these
Jewells delivered unto him, <HI>Aaron</HI> made a molten<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ibid. v. 4.</NOTE> calfe for them to
worship.</P>
<P>&sect; 27. And why a Calfe?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why a Calf.</NOTE> could they finde no fitter resemblance of
God, amongst all the creatures? Why not rather the Lordly Lion, to

of God, rather then the silly senseless calfe, <HI>that eateth Hay?</HI> But, the shape
mattered not much, for if God be made like any thing he may be made
like any thing. It being as unlawfull to fashion him an <HI>Angel,</HI> as a <HI>worm,</HI>
seeing the Commandement<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 4.</NOTE> forbids as well the likeness of things in
<HI>heaven above,</HI> as in <HI>earth beneath.</HI> But, probably a Calfe was preferred be|fore
other formes, because they had learned it from the <HI>Egyptians</HI> wor|shipping

<P>&sect; 1. _IN all peaceable times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Always some publick places for Gods ser|vice.</NOTE> even from the infancy of man|kinde,
certain places were set apart for Gods pub|lick
service. Thus the ancient<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 12. 7, 8. &amp; Gen. 13. 3. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> no sooner
<HI>pitched down their tents,</HI> but they <HI>reared up an Altar</HI> for
divine worship. Indeed this laudable custome had
been intermitted, discontinued and suspended during the <HI>Israelites</HI> af|fliction
in <HI>Egypt,</HI> making hard shift to serve God with <HI>safety,</HI> and <HI>secrecy</HI>
in their own houses, when publick places of adoration were prohibited:
as always in time of persecution, any place which hath the properties
of <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Privacy,</HI> (to <HI>hold</HI> and <HI>hide</HI> the people assembled therein)
may serve for that purpose. But no sooner were the <HI>Israelites</HI> restored
to their liberty (though as yet but in a barren wilderness) but that God
issued out order for the erection of his <HI>Tabernacle to place his Name,</HI> and
fix his peoples devotion therein.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. The materials of this Tabernacle were taken from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Egyptians</HI> justly spoiled.</NOTE>
when the <HI>Israelites,</HI> at their departure,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. 35.</NOTE> <HI>borrowed of them jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold.</HI> The text saith (according to the old Translation) that they
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. 36.</NOTE> <HI>robbed</HI> the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> as indeed to borrow, with an intent never to pay,
is no better then flat felony. But, although this act of the <HI>Israelites</HI> was
<HI>robbery, quoad effectum,</HI> leaving the <HI>Egyptians</HI> spoiled and naked; yet it was
none, <HI>quoad reatum,</HI> having not onely a Commission, but<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. 12.</NOTE> Command
from God for the same. And albeit the <HI>Egyptians</HI> are in some sense, then
said, to<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. 36.</NOTE> <HI>lend</HI> to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> yet in very deed they did but pay back their
due unto them.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. See what it is to detain the <HI>wages of the hireling.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wages long de|tained paid with a witness.</NOTE> Many a year had
these <HI>Israelites,</HI> and their Fathers toiled, and moiled in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and had no|thing

Consideration for their forbearance thereof, was laid them down in a

them, carefully keeping their money for them, till it amounted to a
mass, for their greater benefit; which, if formerly payed them by in|considerable
parcels, might possibly have been spent, as fast as received.</P>

<P>&sect; 5. Behold here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But still keep their callings.</NOTE> how all advanced Gods work, yet every one con|tinued
in his own vocation. Blame worthy their <HI>Pride,</HI> who <HI>will be no|thing,</HI>

<P>&sect; 6. But that which most commended the offering of the <HI>Isr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">elites</HI> in

were rated, or taxed to this work, but all flowed freely from them. This
purified poor peoples <HI>Brass</HI> into <HI>refined gold,</HI> and changed their <HI>Goats-hair</HI>
into <HI>silk,</HI> in Gods acceptance thereof. Otherwise, many may be the <HI>Item's</HI>

acceptation, onely for the want of a good <HI>Imprimis. For if there be FIRST

<P>&sect; 7. One main motive which made them more bountifull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A main mo|tive of their bounty.</NOTE> was to

use. They were therefore engaged to drown that stain with a
more plentifull stream of gifts to Gods service. Thus, the consideration
how prodigall we have formerly been to sin and Satan, ought to make
us hereafter more liberall in the performance of divine duties:<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 19.</NOTE> <HI>For as
yee have yeelded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity, unto iniquity:

<P>&sect; 8. Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their bounty restrained by Proclama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.</NOTE> such was the spring-tyde of the <HI>Israelites</HI> bounty herein, that

being devoid of true grace, and some of this people slain afterwards for
their disobedience. But herein we may consider:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 That this building was but <HI>a worldly Sanctuary,</HI> as the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Apostle</HI> calleth

And he herein so exactly observed his instructions, without the

the erecting of the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> with the Utensils thereof, is described,
these words are twelve severall times solemnly repeated, <HI>As the

This latter alone is presented in our Map, as the proper subject of our

<P>&sect; 14. To resume the <HI>boards</HI> of the <HI>Tabernacle;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The breadth, gilding, sockets and bars of the boards.</NOTE> we have (as formerly)
their <HI>length,</HI> and <HI>breadth,</HI> but not <HI>thickness</HI> expressed in Scripture. <HI>Arias

of the purest metall should be found with exiles in the wilderness. Each
board had two<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Exod 26. 29.</NOTE> <HI>tenons</HI> fastned in their silver <HI>sockets,</HI> which <HI>sockets</HI> some

no need of silver <HI>sockets</HI> if their bravery was all buried in the earth. These
boards had bars also (overlaid with <HI>gold) in the midst of them,</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 29.</NOTE> (understand it
not perforating their thickness, but) running along their breadth in an
even proportion through <HI>golden rings</HI> (as in our draught is described) to

what it was, or where it grew. But, leaving them to <HI>abound in their own

wood. First, it was very durable, therefore usually translated in the
<HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, wood <HI>which never rotteth.</HI> Secondly, it was portable, very
light for carriage, else the <HI>Israelites</HI> coming out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> would never
have cumbered themselves, to have brought heavy lumber along, seeing
such <HI>shittim wood</HI> was not <HI>felled</HI> by them in the way, but<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Exod. 35. 24.</NOTE> <HI>found with them,</HI> as
the text doth observe. Lastly, it was precious, used in the middest of the
most Utensils of the <HI>Tabernacle: Arke,</HI> and both the <HI>Altars,</HI> typifying there
in the <HI>humanity of Christ;</HI> in the <HI>brazen Altar of burnt offering,</HI> resembling his
<HI>satisfaction</HI> when Redeemer; and in the <HI>golden Altar of Incense,</HI> representing
his <HI>intercession</HI> as Mediator; retaining still his [glorified] <HI>body</HI> about him

<P>&sect; 17. Many will wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shittim-wood</HI> within the Altar, why ne|ver fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</NOTE> that this<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Exod. 27. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Shittim-wood</HI> in the middest of
the <HI>Altar</HI> for sacrifices (though plated over with <HI>brass</HI> on each side) was
never fired with the continuall flames thereupon. Some know to their
sorrow how soon such <HI>rafters</HI> or <HI>joices</HI> are set on fire, which by the ill
contrivance of the <HI>Carpenter</HI> run under those <HI>hearths</HI> where constant fires
are kept. But we must know, that on the <HI>Altar</HI> the fire came down from
heaven, and onely minded the dispatch of that message on which it was
sent; and as gun-powder (though ill comparing <HI>fire of heaven,</HI> and<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ignis tartareus.</NOTE> <HI>fire
of hell</HI> together) burnes onely upwards: so this celestiall fire, as in mo|tion,
so in operation, had its activity upwards towards heaven, whence
it derived the descent thereof.</P>
<P>&sect; 18. Expect not here an <HI>enumeration</HI> (much less an <HI>exposition</HI>) of all the
Utensils of the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Laver made of wo|mens Looking|glasses.</NOTE> most of them being formerly touched in <HI>Solo|mons</HI>

so brickle matter when broken could be made usefull, and solidated for
this service. Indeed we have a tradition of one at <HI>Venice,</HI> who made glass
<HI>malleable,</HI> but was for his invention rewarded with death by the State
(who knew full well that they must break, if <HI>glasses</HI> were not broken)
though this is listned unto as a fable. But, to the difficulty in hand, it is
meerly grounded on a mistake, that all <HI>Specula</HI> must needs be <HI>vitrea,</HI> that
what renders the reflexion of a face cannot be but of <HI>glasse.</HI> Whereas
many other <HI>resplendent,</HI> though not <HI>transparent</HI> bodies, doe the same, as
polished <HI>touch, jet, steel,</HI> and <HI>brass,</HI> the purest of the last most probably being
here intended. Surely such <HI>looking-glasses,</HI> which severally were so clear,
lost not their lustre by being many of them melted into the <HI>Laver,</HI> but
(when polished again) retained their returning of resemblances. But,
whether the Priests (as some will have it) made use thereof to disco|ver
<PB N="70" REF="277">
all soiliness in them before they washed, as also after washing, whe|ther
the same were sufficiently cleansed, we dare not define.</P>
<P>&sect; 19. However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Female de|votion.</NOTE> commendable was the devotion of these women in
bringing their <HI>glasses</HI> (dear ornaments in their account) to Gods service.
Oh that men would but part with their superfluous, yea noxious <HI>glasses</HI>

when <HI>The Lord</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Isa. 53. 6.</NOTE> <HI>laid on him the iniquity of us all,</HI> having our<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Isa. 1. 18.</NOTE> <HI>scarlet</HI>

<P>&sect; 24. There needs no other argument to be alledged for the freeness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The speedy fi|nishing of the Tabernacle.</NOTE>

<HEAD>THE
DESCRIPTION
OF
EGYPT. CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1._EGYPT was by the <HI>Hebrews</HI> called <HI>Mizraim</HI> (and
by the <HI>Arabians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The names and bounds of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mesre,</HI> at this day) from<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 10. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Miz|raim</HI>
the second son of <HI>Cham,</HI> first inhabitant
thereof. It was anciently called <GAP DESC="foreign">, by the
most skilfull of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests, as <HI>Plutarch</HI>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Lib. de I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ide &amp; Osyride.</NOTE> observes, no doubt from <HI>Cham</HI> the second
son of Noah: as also it was termed <HI>Hammois</HI> (a
name also generall to <HI>Libya,</HI> yea to all <HI>Africk</HI>) being in the same sound
and sense styled the <HI>Land<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Psal. 105. 23.</NOTE> of Ham</HI> by the Psalmist. It had the Mediter|ranean
sea on the north, <HI>Cyrene</HI> on the west, <HI>Ethiopia</HI> (the countrey of Queen
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 8. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Candace</HI>) on the south, the Red-sea on the east, with a smal <HI>Isthmus</HI> of land
(not past seventy miles over) betwixt it and the Mediterranean. Many
Princes with as great expence as small success, have oft attempted with
their Pioneers to pierce through this slender neck of ground, so to join the
two seas together, for the greater conveniency of traffick. It seems hea|ven
blasted their designes, as an incroachment on the divine Preroga|tive,
it being onely placed in Gods power to give the <HI>Word of Command</HI> to
the Ocean, <HI>Hither shalt thou<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Iob 38. 11.</NOTE> come, but no farther.</HI> And if it be dishonesty to
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Pro. 22. 28.</NOTE> remove Land-markes of mens fixing, how high presumption is it to
alter so ancient and solemn water-bounds of Gods own appointing?</P>
<P>&sect; 2. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> are low in stature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The complexi|ons and condi|tions of the Egyptians.</NOTE> of firme and well compacted
bodies, swarthy and tawny complexions. Hereupon <HI>Abraham</HI> coming
into <HI>Egypt</HI> said to <HI>Sarah</HI> his wife, <HI>Behold NOW, I know that thou art<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Gen. 12. 11.</NOTE> a fair
woman to look upon.</HI> Not that being so many years married, he had hither|to
lived in ignorance of her beauty, and <HI>now</HI> took first notice thereof,
but (as Stars shine brightest in the night) so her fairness was <HI>now</HI> more
<PB N="78" REF="281">
conspicuous amongst the black faces of the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> Their wits anci|ently
were very subtile and searching, esteemed the first inventers of
Arithmetick, Musick, and by reason of the perpetuall serenity of the
aire, they found out the course of the Sun and Stars, first dividing Time
into Moneths, and Years. <HI>The wisdome of the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 King. 4. 20. &amp; Act. 7. 22.</NOTE> Egyptians,</HI> is eminent in
Scripture, much given to Magick, and Divination, yea<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Iannes</HI> and <HI>Iam|bres</HI>
the Inchanters have even to this day some in <HI>Egypt,</HI> heires to their
mysterious impieties. As for the wandering Gypsies, which now a
days pretend to the telling of Fortunes, their best cunning generally is the
credulity of others, oft-times not seeing how near their own feet are to
the stocks, and backs to the whipping-post. Yea commonly they are
counterfeites, coming no more from <HI>Egypt,</HI> then the dissembling <HI>Gibeo|nites</HI>
did from a far<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Iosh. 9. 6.</NOTE> Countrey, and perchance are next neighbours un|to
us.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. A most pleasant Countrey <HI>Egypt</HI> was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pleasure and profit of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> and is. For when the holy
Spirit intended to commend the sweet situation of the <HI>plain of Iordan</HI> (be|fore
it was turned for the sins of the people into a stinking lake) he de|scribeth
it to be <HI>well watered every where, even as the Garden of the Lord, like
the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Gen. 13. 10.</NOTE> land of Egypt.</HI> Nor was the profit less then the pleasure thereof, affor|ding
plenty of the best Wheat, Barly, Rice, and all other grain; insomuch
that this Land was generally <HI>horreum Romani imperii,</HI> the Barn or Granary
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. Indeed I finde the same title given also to the
Island of <HI>Sicily.</HI> And no wonder; for the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire being so vast
and expensive an housekeeper, might wel make use of two Barnes for her
provision. However I dare boldly say, that though <HI>Sicily</HI> was the nearer,
<HI>Egypt</HI> was the bigger and better Barn, and yeelded greatest store of corn
in time of scarcity.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. Flax also was a stable commodity of <HI>Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Egyptian</HI> Flaxe.</NOTE> much whereof at this
day is imported and used in <HI>England.</HI> Of this the finest linen in the
world was woven. The Harlot could tell the silly young man, she
sought to inveigle, <HI>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, and fine<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Prov. 7. 10.</NOTE> linen of Egypt,</HI> as commonly the worst of women, get the
best of wares, to please their luxury. As for the making of this linen
cloth, it will hardly be beleeved, what <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> hath reported, that
the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> used to have their men keep home and spin, while
their women managed their greater businesses abroad. But surely where
the man puts his hand to the spindle, and the woman to the plough, there
the whole family will be ill clad, and worse fed.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Horses of the best kind were very plentifull in <HI>Egypt.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Egyptian</HI> horses excellent.</NOTE> Those
were a prohibited commodity, forbidden by Gods law to be brought
by great numbers into <HI>Israel,</HI> whose King was charged,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Deut. 17. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Not to multiply
horses to himself, nor to cause the people to return into Egypt;</HI> partly, lest whilest
they went thither to course horses, they should change religions, and
fall into love with <HI>Egyptian</HI> Idolatry; partly, lest they should place too
<PB N="79" REF="281">
much confidence in the legs of horses; or arme of flesh, whom God
would have immediately to depend on his own protection.</P>

whereinto it naturally parteth, then laying them on a table and moisten|ing
them with the glutinous water of the River, they pressed them toge|ther,
and so dried them in the Sun. God foretelling his punishments
on<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Isa. 197.</NOTE> <HI>Egypt,</HI> threatneth that <HI>The paper reeds of the brooks, by the mouth of the

<P>&sect; 7. <HI>Mummy</HI> must not be forgotten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mummy how made.</NOTE> being mans flesh, at the first em|balmed
for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 50. 3.</NOTE> forty days together, and afterward for many years buried,
in that hot and sandy Countrey. Yet all art cannot finally avoid the
curse pronounced on mankind,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Dust thou art, and to dust thou must return,</HI>
so that if left alone, these corpses of themselves moulder to ashes. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">her|wise
such cost and curiosity used for their longer preservation, acciden|tally
occasioneth their speedier destruction; such bodies being taken up
out of their graves, bought and brought into forein Countreys for me|dicinall
uses. What, is there such a dearth of drugs? such a famine of
Physick in nature, that (as in the<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">2 King&punc; 6. 28.</NOTE> siege of <HI>Samaria</HI>) one man must feed
on another? However, whilest some squeamish stomacks make faces
to feed on the dead, perhaps their hard hearts at the same time,<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Eate up
the living as if they were dead,</HI> either by fraudulent contracts or forcible
oppressions.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. But these grand commodities of <HI>Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The inconve|niences of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> were also allaied with some
great inconveniencies, many noxious and venimous creatures swarm|ing
therein. The Prophet<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Isa. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">0. 6.</NOTE> called it, <HI>the land from whence come the young and
old Lion, the Viper and the Viper and the fiery-flying Serpent.</HI> This, though mystically meant
of the Kings of <HI>Egypt,</HI> their Lion-like antipathy and cruelty to <HI>Israel</HI>
(styled also <HI>Serpents</HI> for their craft; <HI>flying,</HI> for the swift marching of their
Armies, winged on horse-backs; <HI>fiery,</HI> for the fierceness and heat of their
fury) yet was it also literally true, of plenty of such beasts in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where
that moist and hot Countrey was both the pregnant mother to breed,
and tender nurse to feed them in great abundance. Especially in the
western deserts, towards <HI>Cyrene,</HI> an hideous, and dismall place: and
therefore the<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Tobit. 8. 3.</NOTE> Author of the book of <HI>Tobit,</HI> fitted it with a meet inhabitant,
banishing thither, and binding there, <HI>Asmodeus</HI> the evill spirit, in the ut|most
parts of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 9. Rain is very rare in this land<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rain rare in <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> (and that onely in winter) the
windows of heaven here having no casements, and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> sup|plying
the want of rain, by making gutters out of the river of <HI>Nilus</HI> into
all their grounds and gardens. God therefore in this respect preferreth
the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> before this Countrey,<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Deut. 11. 10.</NOTE> <HI>For the land</HI> (saith he) <HI>whither
thou goest to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came, where
<PB N="80" REF="282">
thou sowedst thy seed, and watered it with thy feet; as a garden of Herbs. But the
land whither thou goest to possess it, is a land of mountains and valleys, and drinketh
water of the rain of heaven.</HI> Surely as it is more honour to receive a boon
immediately from the hand of a Prince, then in an indirect line, from
him, by his servants; so more peculiar was the favour of God to the
<HI>Iews,</HI> and the familiarity of the <HI>Iews</HI> with God, having their land watered
from heaven, whilest the <HI>Egyptians</HI> looked not upward as men, but
downwards as beasts, on that moisture which constantly procured the
fruitfulness of their Countrey. But this pleased them best: as carnall
souls had rather be at a certainty of plenty from Nature, then at an un|certainty
thereof, even from the God of Nature himself. However they
are much mistaken, who have confidently reported that it never raineth
in <HI>Egypt;</HI> seeing I have been informed the contrary, by a right worship|full
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> william Paston of Oxbint in N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rfolk.</NOTE> Person, and well accomplished traveller, a great Patron and
bountifull promoter of my present studies; an eye-witness of much
and violent rain at <HI>Grand-Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> but such as presaged a great mor|tality,
which ensued not long after.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. The River of <HI>Nile</HI> is the happy Genius of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> soil, called

And to make the matter more plain, <HI>Pomponius</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Lib. 5. c. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Mela</HI> reporteth, that the
fountain of <HI>Nilus</HI> is called <HI>Nachul</HI> by the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> A river wherein na|ture
hath observed an even tenour of admirableness, so that the birth,
the life, and the death thereof, I mean the fountain, flowing, and fall of
the river, are equally composed of a concatenation of wonders.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Fountain. The particular place thereof being never as yet known
certainly. So that (as the<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Mat. 13. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Tares</HI> in the Gospell, were beheld, not
when sown, but when grown) <HI>Nilus</HI> appears even at the first in
a full stream and fair chanell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Flowing: which constantly beginneth with the rising Sun on
the seventeenth of <HI>Iune,</HI> swelling by degrees untill it mount
sometimes twenty four Cubits, and that the uttermost (for an|ciently
sixteen was the highest it attained unto:) and answerable
to the increase of this river is the plenty of scarcity of the follow|ing
year. Nor doth this overflowing of <HI>Nile,</HI> give onely wealth,
but also health to <HI>Egypt.</HI> For if five hundred chance to dye in a
day in <HI>Cairo</HI> of the plague (a<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">G. Sandys Trav. p. 97.</NOTE> mortality not rare in so populous
a place, where the sound keep company with the sick, holding
death fatall, and to avoid it irreligion) not one doth die the day
following.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Fall. For at the influx thereof into the sea, the fresh water keeps
<PB N="81" REF="282">
together, and contrary to other rivers, changeth the colour of the
salt&punc; far<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Idem. p. 94.</NOTE> farther into the sea then the shore from thence can be
discerned.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Nor less wonderfull are the creatures in and about this river, the bird
<HI>Trochilus,</HI> the <HI>Ichneumon,</HI> or <HI>Rat of Nilus;</HI> the <HI>Crocodiles</HI> and <HI>River-horses,</HI>
(though as big as a cow, and proportioned as a<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Idem. pa. 99.</NOTE> swine) for all which
we send the Reader for his better information to that modern learned
Philosopher,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Windeline de ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ira. Nili.</NOTE> who hath made a just tract thereof. Onely we will adde,
that not moe cures are prescribed for the tooth-ach, then causes by seve|rall
Authors assigned for the flowing of <HI>Nilus,</HI> nor are the one farther
from giving the body ease, then the other the minde satisfaction.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. With the flowing of the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Egyptians</HI> proud of <HI>Nilus</HI></NOTE> rose also the Pride of the <HI>Egypti|ans,</HI>
exceeding all bounds and banks of modesty and moderation, defy|ing
Nature it self, because (as <HI>Isocrates</HI> saith) they had both drought and
moisture in their own dispositions. And such their land is described by
the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">an. l. 8.</NOTE> Poet:
<Q><L>Terra suis contenta bonis; non indiga mercis,</L>
<L>Aut Iovis, in solo tanta est fiducia Nilo.</L>
<L>A land content with home-bred ware,</L>
<L>For forein wealth she doth not care,</L>
<L>Or whether heavens do frown or smile,</L>
<L>Her confidence is all in Nile.</L></Q>
Yea so impudent is the <HI>Egyptian</HI> arrogance herein, that whereas <HI>Nilus</HI>
makes <HI>Egypt</HI> and God made both, they falsly boast<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 29. 3.</NOTE> once and<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 29. 9.</NOTE> again in
the Prophet, <HI>My river is mine own, and I have made it for my self;</HI> whereupon
God to clear his own property and right to the creature, threatneth to
shew his judgements on that river,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 29. 10.</NOTE> <HI>from the tower of Syen even unto the bor|der
of Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 12. <HI>Nilus</HI> venteth it self into the Mediterranean sea, with seven
mouths, nothing being more famous in humane poetry and prose then
this septemfluous river. The holy spirit takes notice of the same num|ber,
threatning utterly to destroy the <HI>tongue of the Ethiopian Sea, when with
his mighty wind he shall shake his hands over the river, and shall smite it in the seven
streams, and make men go over dry-shod:</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Isa. 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</NOTE> which words admit of severall in|terpretations.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 The strength of <HI>Egypt</HI> is hereby mystically meant, whose king|dome
was afterwards destroyed, and the Countrey thereof con|quered
and subdued to the Persian Monarchy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 It probably was literally performed, when <HI>Nilus</HI> by ominous ac|cident
failed to overflow (as in the tenth and eleventh year of
<HI>Cleopatra</HI>) and his streams became low, and shallow thereupon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The ancient and originall chanels thereof are now in time ob|structed,
new conveyances succeeding in their place.</ITEM>
</LIST>
An alteration elsewhere obvious. In the Isle of <HI>Elie (Englands Egypt</HI> for
the flatness, moistness, and fruitfulness thereof) how are the old, and
once plentifull streams of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Vide Camdens Brit. in Cambr. sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re.</NOTE> <HI>Nyne</HI> and <HI>Welland</HI> impoverished, by artificiall

made, to drive mills, to drain meadows; fence fields, bear boats,
and other private conveniences? Rivers having as little certainty to
possess their proper chanels, as men their houses, ancient families being
daily outed by other of later extraction.</P>
<P>&sect; 13. However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Various num|bring of the streams of <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE> though the seven streams of <HI>Nilus</HI> pass current in
most mouths, yet they are reckoned up, both over and under that num|ber,
by authours of excellent credit.

<ITEM>M^r.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Trav. pa. 94.</NOTE> <HI>Sandys,</HI> but two navigable branches extant in our age.</ITEM>
</LIST>
This various reckoning, exceeding seven, ariseth, because anciently, some
onely counted the grand and solemn <HI>ostiaries</HI> of <HI>Nilus</HI> (and these, which
they be at this day, let such enquire which are of the <HI>Commission of Sewers</HI>
amongst the <HI>Egyptians</HI>) whiles others cast all his <HI>chanelets</HI> (rather <HI>cuts</HI>
then <HI>courses</HI>) into the number. Since, they fall short, either choaked
up, or commixed, yet still maintain in mens talk the reputation of <HI>seven.</HI>
For, when a naturall, or noted number is once up in the market, small
occasionall variations thereof, more or less, can never beat it down in
common discourse. Thus, <HI>Thomas</HI> is termed <HI>one of the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Iohn 20. 24&punc;</NOTE> twelve,</HI> when
there were but eleven, after the self-execution of <HI>Iudas,</HI> and before the
election of <HI>Matthias.</HI> In a word, the chanels of <HI>Nilus,</HI> daily decreased in
number, because (as pinked or slashed clothes have the fewer holes
the longer they are worn) so his streams fret one into another;
especially, the ground being so soft and tender which lyeth betwixt
them.</P>
<P>&sect; 14. To come now to the particular description of <HI>Egypt;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Dogs.</NOTE> <HI>Nilus</HI>
flowing out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> compassed an Island called the <HI>Isle of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ortelius</HI> and <HI>Mercators</HI> old Maps.</NOTE> Dogs;</HI> but,
why so named, I know as little, as why those rich meadows lying be|twixt
<HI>London</HI> and <HI>Black-wall,</HI> are called after the same name, though bet|ter
deserving to be termed the <HI>Isle of Oxen,</HI> from the fat cattell feeding
therein. But, seeing no mention of this, or the next Island (which <HI>Nilus</HI>
makes) in Scripture, we pass them by, confining our ensuing discourse
to Gods Word alone; save onely, that we will take leave to survey the
Pyramides, because<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Anti. Iud. li. 2 K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Iosephus</HI> (though erroneously) conceiveth them

and worse with the <HI>Arabian</HI> authours, so that <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Nat. hist. li. 36. cap. 12.</NOTE> gravely ob|serves
<PB N="83" REF="283">
it a just punishment on the vanity of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ounders, that they are
forgotten. Indeed, in the Criticisme of credit, the Artisans cunning
might cry halfes in honour, with the Kings cost in this structure; but,
both the one and the other, are equally buried in silence, so that the most
skilfull <HI>Egyptian</HI> Antiquary cannot out of these Hieroglyphicks of
pompe and pride, read the name of either. Whilest the poor midwives,
who contrary to <HI>Pharaohs</HI> command preserved the Hebrews children,
are to this day remembred by their names, <HI>Shiphrah</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Exod. 1. 15.</NOTE> and <HI>Puah.</HI> Thus
memories founded on the rock of vertue, stand firme, and fast; when
they quickly fall, built on the foundered bottome of affected magnifi|cence.
Indeed, these Pyramides are of stupendious vastness, and may
be termed <HI>Arts mountains,</HI> though mole-hills, yea, but warts, if compa|red
to those which Nature hath produced. So ridiculous is the unequall
contest in point of bulk, betwixt their severall workmanships, that

on a point of policy, onely to busie their people, to prevent in them
laziness and luxury, (the mother of mutinies) knowing, so rich a soile
would invite them to riot, if out of employment. But (whatever was
their principall project) their secundary end intended such structures
for sepulchers, where the builders bodies lay, not interred, but immured,
with all imaginable cost bestowed upon them. For, the <HI>Egyptians</HI> fond|ly
conceived (Reader, pity them, and praise God that thou are better in|formed)
that the soul even after death, like a gratefull guest, dwelt in the
body so long, as the same was kept swept and garnished, but finally for|sook
it, and sought out a new body, if once the corpse were either care|lesly
neglected, or dispightfully abused; and therefore to wooe the soul
to constant residence in their bodies (at least wise to give it no wilfull
distaste, or cause of alienation) they were so prodigiously expensive, both
in imbalming their dead, and erecting stately places for their monu|ments.</P>

to make profit of their Marble, and rich materials; no humorous, or
spightfull Prince offered to overthrow them, meerly to get a greater
name for his peevishness in confounding, then their pride in first
founding them; No Zelote-reformer (whilest <HI>Egypt</HI> was Christian)
demolished them under the notion of Pagan monuments. But, survi|ving
such casualties, strange, that after so long continuance, they have
not fallen like Copy-holds, into the hand of the Grand Signeur (as
Lord of the Manor) for want of repairing. Yea, at the present, they are
rather ancient, then ruinous; and, though weather-beaten in their tops,

<PB N="85" REF="284">
in the same place; and here, or hereabouts the ten <HI>Egyptian</HI> plagues were
first inflicted, in manner and order ensuing.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 All the water (formerly the merciless executioner of the Jewish
infants) was for seven days turned into bloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ten plagues of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> whereby the fish
dyed, and the river stank, <HI>so that the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Exod. 7. 21.</NOTE> Egyptians could not drink of the

delicious, witness the answer of <HI>Pescentius Niger</HI> unto his mur|muring
souldiers, <HI>What? crave you wine, and have Nilus to drink of?</HI>
The transubstantiation of this element into bloud, extended over
all the <HI>streams, rivers, ponds, and pooles in Egypt,</HI> and the sea onely was
excepted, from whence (or from pits newly<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Exod. 7. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</NOTE> digged in the
ground) the Magicians might fetch their water, which in imitati|tion
of <HI>Moses, quoad similitudinem,</HI> if not <HI>veritatem,</HI> they also turned
into bloud.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Frogs, so plentifull that they covered the land, and so presumptu|ous
they came into <HI>Pharaohs<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Exod. 8. 3.</NOTE> Bed-chamber,</HI> (though never sworn
his Grooms in ordinary attendance) yea, they crept <HI>into the very ovens</HI>
(as if <HI>Salamanders</HI> rather then frogs) and no private place was
priviledged from their unwelcome company. But the Magi|cians
made the like in show, if not in substance, the Devill much
delighting in their monstrous shape, for we finde in<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Revel. 16. 13.</NOTE> Scripture,
<HI>Three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the Dragon.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Lice, Insects, with so many lineaments in a little compass, that
the eyes of the Magicians could not see, much less imitate
them, so that they were forced to confess it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Exod. 8. 19.</NOTE> <HI>the finger of God.</HI> But,
whether thus beaten out of distance, they here left off their race of
emulation with <HI>Moses,</HI> or still continued it, it is hard to determine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Flies,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Exod. 8. 21.</NOTE> properly waspes, or hornets, armed with stings, wherewith
they tormented the people. Surely, they were more then ordinary
flies, because they brought <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to proffer to <HI>Moses,</HI> a partiall and
conditionall departure of the people.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 A generall Murrain, insomuch that<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Exod. 9. 6.</NOTE> <HI>all the cattell of Egypt dyed.</HI> Some
will object, If this was a totall destruction of all the beasts in the
land, how came it to pass, that some afterward were killed by<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Exod. 9. 25.</NOTE> the
hail, and after that, in the tenth plague, <HI>the first-born<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Exod. 13. 15.</NOTE> of beasts</HI> were
destroyed by the Angell? But it is answered, <HI>All,</HI> here is taken <HI>com|muniter,
non universaliter,</HI> for the greater, and most considerable num|ber.
Or else, the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in the interim (some distance of time
being betwixt the severall plagues, and a year from the first to the
last) furnished themselves afresh with new supply of cattell from
forein Countreys, which second stock was also afterwards de|stroyed.
So vain is it, for men to outvie Gods routings, with their
recruitings; his desolations, with their replantations; and no
new store, without a new heart, can hold out against his punish|ments.</ITEM>

<ITEM>9 <HI>Positive and palpable darkness</HI> for three days, not so much from the
suspension of the sun-beams, or detention of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> eyes, as
condensation of the aire with thick clouds, probably also
extinguishing all fire, and artificiall lights, as candles goe out in a
damp. The Authour of the book<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Wisd. 17. 4.</NOTE> of <HI>Wisdome</HI> addeth, that the
<HI>Egyptians</HI> during that time, were frighted with terrible sounds,
with sad shapes and apparitions, which is more then the Scripture
affirmeth, though we deny not, but that darkness is the pliable
wax, whereof a guilty fancy may mould to it self any frightfull
impressions. Thus all the land of <HI>Egypt</HI> was before-hand hung with
mourning, against the death of her people, and all the <HI>Egyptians</HI>
were for three days imprisoned in their places, not moving thence,
so great was the darkness. Whilest the <HI>Israelites,</HI> though in the same
Climate with them, were in effect their Antipodes, it being day
and summer with the one, when night and winter with the other.</ITEM>

Angell all over <HI>Egypt.</HI> Here if any object, that the plague could not

that God in his providence so ordered, that every house yeelded a
fit object for his justice. And seeing <HI>Pharaoh</HI> their Soveraign was

that his subjects were made fruitfull on design, that they might be
deprived of their first-born. However, grant it onely in most

Yet the younger brethren could not brag of the lands they got by
this accident, fearing for the present, lest their own turn was next,

in the Red-sea.</ITEM>

Can the walls of that City stand long safe, against which so great bullets
are discharged? These threatnings took slow but sure effect, and at this
day it is justly become a desolation. For, seeing all <HI>Egypt</HI> bare an im|placable

<P>&sect; 35. This his first essay succeeding so well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is upbraided with k.</NOTE> <HI>Moses</HI> would adventure

who made him a Judge, and whether he<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Exod. 2. 14.</NOTE> intended to kill him, as he did
the <HI>Egyptian.</HI> I see it is no sufficient proof, because the party is Plaintiffe
that his cause is the best, seeing sometimes they that are most injurious,

I conceive this reason, that they abstained from it, as a colour sacred
and mysterious, then which none more used about the Tabernacle, and
Temple, in the curtains, vailes, and vestments thereof. Onely we read,
that ordinary <HI>Iews,</HI> by Gods command, were to make that lace, or rib|band

that heavenly meditations were the best ligament, to continue,

which was used in <HI>Solomons</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 2. 7. 14. &amp; 3. &amp; 14.</NOTE> <HI>Temple,</HI> and in the garments of the prin|cipall

<HI>blew,</HI> chiefly dyed at <HI>Tyre,</HI> and taking the tincture thereof from the liquor
of a shel-fish, formerly found plentifully in the sea thereabouts, but ut|terly

commendable gravity of the ancient <HI>Germanes,</HI> kept the same form for
many ages. Indeed their clothes, being for the most part loose vestments,
not exactly fitted to their bodies, but onely cast over, wrapped about, or
girded unto them, the less curiosity was required in their making.
Hence it is, that we finde the <HI>Philistines</HI> their<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Judg. 14. 19.</NOTE> clothes fitting <HI>Samsons</HI>
friends, and <HI>Ionathans</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Sam. 18. 4.</NOTE> robe given to <HI>David,</HI> serving him without any

Thus the young man, late at night allarum'd out of his bed, with the

And to prevent the dangling down, and dagling of so long garments,
the <HI>Iews</HI> used, when sent on<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">2 King. 4. 29.</NOTE> an errand, when taking a journey, when

up their clothes about them. Hence a <HI>girdle</HI> is taken in Scripture for
strength, readiness, and activity, whilest the want thereof denoteth weak|ness,

as the threads in those thrummed fringes were woven together. The
<HI>blew lace</HI> tying them to the four skirts, typified how closely Gods law
ought to be applied, and fastned to our hearts. By the rules of the
<HI>Rabbins,</HI> every free-born male-child amongst the <HI>Iews,</HI> when knowing
to cloth himself, was bound to wear these <HI>fringes.</HI> But women, servants,

them not themselves, others did behold them. <HI>Gedilim</HI> (they say) was
the thrums woven in the cloth, and <HI>Zizith</HI> was an addition of threads
tyed with knots thereunto, but the particular and numerous Criticismes
thereof we refer to such as delight in Rabbinicall disquisitions. Onely
adding, that the modern <HI>Iews</HI> have wholly left off the formall wearing
of <HI>fringes,</HI> alledging this reason thereof, because they have utterly lost
the mystery of making the <HI>blew ribband</HI> (even by their own<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ainsworth</HI> on <HI>Num</HI> 15. 39.</NOTE> confessi|on)

But now, as once the <HI>Eunuch</HI> said concerning a more mysterious passage
in this Prophet,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Act. 8. 31.</NOTE> <HI>How can I understand without an interpreter?</HI> So here
without the same help, who can attain to the meaning thereof?</P>
<P>&sect; 3. In the first place we may conceive many of these ornaments
were onely temporary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many of these ornaments temporary for that age.</NOTE> as used by the <HI>Fashionists</HI> of that age, which
afterwards disused, both name and thing came to be abolished. Which
frequently comes to pass in all kinde of apparell, whose very names by
degrees grow old, wax thread-bare, turne to rents, to rags, to nothing.
For instance, it would pose a good <HI>Antiquary,</HI> to describe the exact
fashion of<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Camd. Remains pag.</HI> 196.</NOTE> <HI>Herlots, Paltocks, Gits, Haketons, Tabards, Court-pies, Chevesailes,</HI>
and <HI>Gipsers:</HI> barbarous names, which may seem to carry a Spell or
Conjuration in the mention of them. Yet all these were kindes of gar|ments,
commonly used in <HI>England</HI> some four hundred years agoe. Yea,
pride playing in all ages upon conceited opinions of decency, hath in|finitely
varied the fashion of all apparell, customes of our Ancestours
appearing as antick to us, as our fashions (perchance) will seem in|credible
to posterity. Who would beleeve, that ever our <HI>English,</HI> some
four hundred years since, wore shooes s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">outed and piked more then a
finger long, crooking upwards (called<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mentloned in the History cal|led <HI>Eulogium.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Crackowes</HI>) resembling the
Devils claws, which were fastened to the knees with chains of gold,
and silver? Or, that about the reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, men grew
so excessive in that kind, that it was fain to be ordered by Proclamation,
that none should<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Camd. Re|mains. pa.</HI> 197. Pride the grea|test offence in these orna|ments.</NOTE> <HI>weare their shooes broader at the toes then six inches?</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4. Secondly, of these ornaments, some were necessary, as <HI>fine-linen;</HI>
others modest, as <HI>Vailes;</HI> moe (though costly) comely, as <HI>ear-rings,</HI> and
<HI>bracelets;</HI> (which<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gen. 24. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Rebekah</HI> her self, and the best of women did weare)
<PB N="114" REF="299">
most of them (some few excepted) though magnificent, lawfull, if not
exceeding the wearers estate. Some therefore will demand why the
Prophet reproved them, and why God was offended therewith? But,
we must know, the things were not so faulty in their own nature,
as for the superfluous variety, fantasticall fashion, and over costly mat|ter
thereof. But, which is the main, the mindes of the wearers did the
mischiefe, whose fingers (as I may say) infected their <HI>Rings;</HI> and
mouthes marred their <HI>Mufflers,</HI> being used with pride, and abused to
wantonnefs. The text saith, <HI>The daughters of Sion were haughty and walked
with<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Isa. 3. 16.</NOTE> stretched out necks</HI> (and <GAP DESC="foreign"> to <HI>boast</HI> is by<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Vide Stepha|num.</NOTE> <HI>Criticks</HI> deduced from

<HI>and wanton eies, walking and mincing as they goe, and making a tinkling with
their feet,</HI> carrying (it seems) bells at their heels, whose musick did jar
with modesty, and gave the <HI>watchword</HI> to wantons, at what <HI>Signe</HI> mer|cenary
embraces were to be sold unto them.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nose-jewels how fastened.</NOTE> of such as were meer superfluities, none appear more
ridiculous and strange then the <HI>nose-jewels</HI> in Hebrew <GAP DESC="foreign"> leaving us
at a loss how they were fastned. Surely, the <HI>Iewish</HI> women were not
ringed <HI>swine-like,</HI> nor had they, like the Salvages in <HI>America,</HI> their noses
bored through to hang jewels therein. For, although some may plead,
<HI>Pride never feels pain;</HI> as also, that the absurdest fashions, when made
common, seem comely; yet such holes in their noses (moe nostrils
then ever nature made) must of necessity hinder, both their speech,
and plainer pronunciation: except, (as some conceive) they were
fastned with gold, or silver-hoops about thier noses. For mine own
part, I suppose these <HI>nose-jewels</HI> the same with <HI>frontlets,</HI> frequent among
the <HI>Iews,</HI> or else some pendants fastened thereunto:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 First, because <HI>frontlets</HI> (otherwise ordinary ornaments) are
omitted in this catalogue.</ITEM>

which and the nose no great distance) hanging down on a peak
from their foreheads.</ITEM>
</LIST>
However, 'tis probable these <HI>nose-jewels</HI> were <HI>frontlets</HI> of a larger size, more
prominent then ordinary, as pride in process of time improveth it self
to a greater proportion. And most certain it is, God was highly dis|pleased
with this their luxury; witness his heavy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Isa. 3. 24.</NOTE> commination, <HI>And
it shall come to pass, that in stead of sweet smell there shall be stinke; and in stead of

prediction.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. Whereas it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What meant by burning.</NOTE> <HI>in stead of beauty burning,</HI> I question whether it

of God, and brake down the wall of Ierusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof

<P>&sect; 8. The mention of turning a <HI>sweet smell into a stink,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iews</HI> generally ill sented.</NOTE> mindes me of a

<HEAD>THE
IDOLS OF THE
IEWS. CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. _IT is hard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idolatry very ancient.</NOTE> exactly to define, when Idolatry first
began. It is generally thought about the days
of <HI>Enos, Adams</HI> grandchild; grounded upon
<HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 26. though little certainty can be col|lected
from those words, so variously transla|ted.
We may safely conceive, it began very
early, in the infancy of mankinde: it being
true of the great <HI>World,</HI> what is said of Man the <HI>Microcosme,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 58. 3.</NOTE> The wicked are
estranged from the wombe, they goe astray speaking lies, as soon as they be born.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 2. If we enquire into the causes of the variety of Idols,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First reason of many Gods, multiformity of Errour.</NOTE> and far
spreading of superstition, these principally present themselves. First, the
multiformity of error in its own nature. If truth be once casually lost,
but especially if wilfully left, numberless are the by-paths of falshood.
Nothing under an Infinite, can expleat, and satiate the immortall minde
of man. Who having once forsaken God, infinite in power, thought to
fill it self with Idols, infinite in number; leaving still a blank, and reser|ving
their souls for<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 23.</NOTE> <HI>unknown Gods,</HI> when they should be added there|unto.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second misun|derstanding of Gods Prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|dence.</NOTE> the mistaking the attribute, of divine Providence.
Men did conceive the whole world, and all therein, too large a compass
for one God to actuate and inform. And therefore as <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Nat. hist.</NOTE> observeth,
that the old <HI>Eagles determinant spatia,</HI> assign severall and certain circuits to
their young ones to flye and feed in, without interfering each on others
dominions; so the heathen confined topicall Gods to particular places.
<HI>Their Gods</HI> (say<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 King. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">0. 23.</NOTE> the <HI>Syrians</HI> of the <HI>Israelites) are Gods of the hills;</HI> (perchance
collecting the same from the <HI>Iews</HI> usuall sacrificing in high places) <HI>we
will fight against them in the plain,</HI> and surely we shall be stronger then they.
<PB N="124" REF="304">
This mindes me of the speech of a<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">I doe not say his name was <HI>Coya Shawsware</HI> of whom in <HI>Stows Survey. pag.</HI> 780.</NOTE> <HI>Persian</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> attendant on the

(saith he) <HI>have the Englishmen two Gods, the one for the City, and the other for the
Countrey?</HI> A mistake in the heathen, which gave the occasion of multi|plying
of Deities: some shadow of whose superstition, still remains
in Popish <HI>Saint-worship.</HI> For whereas Christ gave his Disciples power

civill, into divine honour, translating such famous <HI>Heroes</HI> from the front

the propensity of the people of <HI>Israel</HI> to adore <HI>Moses</HI> when dead, had not

were also disposed in matches, thus filling the world with families of

profit by Idolatry; seeing, as the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 20.</NOTE> Apostle observeth, what they saerifi|ced, they <HI>sacrifittced to Devills.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 7. In the progress of Idolatry we may observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ur steps of Idolat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</NOTE> first, they began to
worship <HI>glorious creatures, The Sun, with all the host of heaven,</HI> mentioned by
holy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Job. 31. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Iob,</HI> an ancient writer. But all the stars in heaven were too few for
them to adore. Hence they proceed to worship <HI>usefull creatures, sheep, oxen</HI>
&amp;c. stepping thence to the adoration of <HI>things hurtfull, Dragons, Serpents,
Crocodiles;</HI> probably in fear, for a <HI>Ne noceant,</HI> that they should doe them
no harm. Lastly, they gave divine honour to all creatures in generall,
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Changing the glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible
man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things:</HI> their children not
making more babies, then their parents did Idols. But of all, the <HI>Egyp|tian</HI>
superstition, rather then it would sit out, plaid at the smallest game;
<PB N="125" REF="304">
they worshipping besides <HI>Oxen,</HI> and <HI>Sheep, Onions</HI> and <HI>Leeks,</HI> in their gar|dens:
So that one may justly admire that their superstition did not
starve them. For this being granted, that they would not eat what they
did adore, (which is laid to the charge of the Papists, how truly I have
now no leasure to examine) it is hard to conceive where they found
food to satisfie their hunger, besides the objects of their Idolatry.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. If now in the next place we descend to enquire, what should
make men so much to dote on the visible representations of their Dei|ties,
contrary to the nature of a spirit; we shall finde it proceed from
thier infidelity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infidelity the main cause of worshipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng God in a visible shape.</NOTE> not able to apprehend God under the notion of an incor|poreal
Being. And therefore to contract the species of their devotion, they
fixed it in a materiall object, lest otherwise with them their God should
be <HI>out of sight, out of minde.</HI> Saint <HI>Lewes</HI> of <HI>France</HI> loved much to hear Sermons,
whilest our King <HI>Henry</HI> the third his contemporary, was more for be|ing
at Mass, saying <HI>he had rather see his God then hear another speake eloquently
of him.</HI> This humour of seeing a Deity (though venting it self other|ways)
possessed the hearts of people in all ages, who being unable to
raise up their minds to conceive God every where, loved to look on him
bodily represented in some materiall Image.</P>
<P>&sect; 9. Infidelity thus premised as the main cause, two other occasions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two occasions thereof.</NOTE>
no ways given by God, but ignorantly taken by men, much advanced
such visible representations: First, Gods frequent appearing to the Pa|triarchs
in a bodily shape. Which being but then assumed, voluntary,
occasionall, and for the present purpose, was misinterpreted by men
for naturall, necessary, constant, and an essentiall part of his Being: and
thence they concluded him a corporeall substance.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second occasi|on of making images.</NOTE> Image-making was much advantaged by some ex|pressions
in Scripture, that God used <HI>after the manner of men,</HI> allaying the
purity of his nature, with humane Phrases, so to work himself the bet|ter
down to our capacities. Should God speake of himself as he is, his
expressions would be as incomprehensible as his Essence. Hereupon,
men, in stead of thinking higher of Gods <HI>Goodness,</HI> thought lower of
his <HI>Greatness,</HI> and not able to conceive his <HI>Providence</HI> by his <HI>Eye,</HI> cleare de|monstration
of his <HI>Power</HI> by his <HI>Arme,</HI> clearer by his <HI>Hand,</HI> clearest by
his <HI>Finger, attention</HI> by his <HI>Eares, gracious presence</HI> by his <HI>Face</HI> &amp;c. fell first
in their brains to fancy, and then with their hands to form him a bodi|ly
Image, or Idol. Idols, which though (as the <HI>Psalmist</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Psal. 105. 5.</NOTE> observeth) <HI>they
have mouths and speake not,</HI> yet are termed by the <HI>Prophet,</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Habak. 2. 18.</NOTE> <HI>teachers of lies,</HI>
misinforming men with most false apprehensions.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. But their impieties stopped not here, but proceeded from a
corporall, to a vicious assimilation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second assi|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lation in badness.</NOTE> and soon after inferred their Gods
conformity to man, as well in lewdness, as in limbes, badness, as bodi|ly
proportion. This they falsely collected from the impunity of many
profane persons, interpreting Gods silence, consent; as approving,
<PB N="126" REF="305">
because not presently punishing their wicked practises. <HI>These things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ast
thou done, and I kept<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Psal. 50. 21.</NOTE> silence, and thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as
thy self.</HI> Thus because many <HI>Theeves</HI> have thrived by their felonious cour|ses,
<HI>Drunkards</HI> in their distempers have strangely escaped dangers, and
<HI>Harlots</HI> have grown wealthy by their mercenary embraces; the hea|thens
have fancied <HI>Mercury</HI> the God and Patron of theft, <HI>Bacchus</HI> of drun|kenness,
<HI>Venus</HI> and (as some will have it) <HI>Flora</HI> of whoredom, con|ceiving
such Gods guilty themselves of the same sins, and friends, fa|vourers,
yea protectors thereof in others.</P>
<P>&sect; 12. But to return to their worshipping of Idols. True it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference be|twixt the lear|ned and simple heathens Ido|latry.</NOTE> the
most knowing and rationall amongst the heathens, adored not the very
materiall Image, but in, under, through, and beyond the same worship|ped
the true God of heaven and earth. And in all ages some were found
who flouted at such superstitions: amongst these the Poet brings in an
Idol thus speaking.
<Q><L>Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,</L>
<L>Cum faber incertus scamnum facer&eacute;tne, De&uacute;mve;</L>
<L>Maluit esse Deum.</L>
<L>Time out of minde a fig-tree stock I grew,</L>
<L>An useless block, before the workman knew,</L>
<L>Benches, or Gods to make me, (smal the ods)</L>
<L>Resolv'd at last of me to make his Gods.</L></Q>
Semblable whereunto is the story of a Countrey-man in <HI>Spain,</HI> who
coming to an Image enshrined, the extraction and first making whereof
he could well remember, and not finding from the same that respectfull
usage which he expected, (haply because he had not feed the Friers to
their contentment, who accordingly do sell such frowns and smiles)
<HI>You need not</HI> (quoth he) <HI>be so proud, for I have known you from a Plum|tree.</HI>
But although the wiser sort both of <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> worship|ped
God under the Image, so onely faulty in <HI>symbolicall Idolatry,</HI> and
breach of the second Commandement, serving the true Deity in a false
and forbidden manner, yet the ignorant people amongst them both,
were directly guilty of dull downright Idolatry, breaking both first and
second Commandement, adoring a false God with a false service. And
as <HI>Iacob,</HI> though bound by his own vow to goe on to<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gen. 28. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Bethel,</HI> yet either
out of faintness or forgetfulness, set up his staffe short thereof at the
City of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gen. 33. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Shechem,</HI> where he bought a dwelling; so the devotion of igno|rant
people, though projecting perchance a longer journey to themselves
to worship God in the Image, tired in their travell, and taking up a
nearer lodging, terminated their worship in that visible object presented
unto them. Thus Gods Spirit, though allowing liberty to the <HI>Potter</HI> of
the same clay to <HI>make one vessell to honour and another to dishonour,</HI> sharply
reproveth the<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Isa. 44. 16, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who makes a fire for his warming, and a God
for his worshipping of the self same wood.</P>
<P>&sect; 13. But grant Idols originally frequent amongst the <HI>Heathen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How heathen Idols were first brought in a|mongst the <HI>Iews.</HI></NOTE> a

very many the Idols mentioned in Scripture, yet our mistake may make

<P>&sect; 45. Yet to give the <HI>Iews</HI> their due, in the days of our Saviour they

shunning open profaneness, they reeled into spirituall pride, hypocrisie,
superstitious observing the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> equalling Traditions with Scripture
&amp;c. sins chiefly reproved in the Sermons of our Saviour.</P>
<P>&sect; 46. As for <HI>Christians,</HI> their principles pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> them from <HI>formall</HI>
worshipping of Idols, though too often guilty of what may be termed,
<HI>tralatitious Idolatry,</HI> when any thing (good and lawfull in its own nature)
is loved, or honoured above, or even with God himself. Thus money
may and must be loved and used, as the <HI>Centurion</HI> did his<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mat. 8. 9.</NOTE> servant, <HI>Doe
this, and he doth it,</HI> fetch me meat from the shambles, and money fetcheth

termed <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 47. Indeed Idolatry is a subtill sin; and seeing by nature we retain
in our hearts the principles of all old Errors, it is to be feared that this
sin finding its usuall way obstructed, will watch its own advantage,
to vent it self by some other conveyances: Yea as Pride may grow out
of humility; so Idolatry may sprout out of the detestation thereof;
when men (like <HI>Iehu</HI> rooting out <HI>Baal&punc;</HI> and erecting his own opinion

<HEAD>CHAP. 1. The intention of the Author in this Treatise.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_PLATO</HI> being sick said to the Physician being about to
prescribe Physick unto him, Cure me not <GAP DESC="foreign">
<HI>as a Countrey-oxe-driver,</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign">, as one well
versed in Philosophy; and demanded of him the
reason of his receipts, how the medicine was proper
for his malady, <HI>why this, why thus, why now, why thus
much, why no more</HI> was prescribed unto him. In like manner it seemeth
unreasonable for Map-makers, here to plant a wood, there mount a hill,
here to sink a valley, there to run a river in their draughts; and then
magisterially obtrude all these on the beliefe of an ingenuous Reader,
without giving a particular account how the same are conformable to
Nature and true Geography: especially seeing it is vehemently suspected,
that many maps are full of affected extravagancies. And must their
fancies draw up the forms for other mens judgments to subscribe?</P>
<P>But on the other side it seems not onely an ungentile harshness, but
an unconscionable injustice, strictly to exact a reason for every <HI>Puntillo</HI>
in a Map. Gally-slaves would be in a more freer condition then Geo|graphers,
if thus dealt with. As the Poets feign <HI>Atlas</HI> was wearied by
bearing the weight of heaven, <HI>Mercator</HI> would be more tired by bearing
the burden of his own <HI>Atlas,</HI> if questioned for the crookedness or straight|ness
of every line in so vast a volume. A lawfull latitude herein hath
<PB N="136" REF="314">
been ever allowed. For instance, it is generally agreed that <HI>Meander,</HI> a
River in <HI>Phrygia,</HI> runs wonderfully winding; but it breaks not the head
of Truth in a Map, if a curle of that River be made more or less, or be
put out of its proper place. Let the Stewards of Lords Courts, or rather
Bailifes of Gentlemens Manors know each nook of a wood, corner of a
field, reach of a River within so small a compass; such as describe a
Countrey in generall, if truly presenting the most materiall things there|in
without visible disproportion, doe what their diligence can exactly
perform, and what the Readers discretion can rationally expect.</P>
<P>Desiring therefore to acquit my self in the best manner to all ingeni|ous
capacities, I have here exposed my self to the strongest objection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
which without favour or flattery, I could make against the former de|scription.
And left scattering of them before in the respective Tribes
should have interrupted the entireness of our discourse (what thred can
run smooth if full of so many knots? we have reserved them all for a
small Treatise by themselves in the conclusion of the work. Solemnly
promising that if any shall enfavour me so far as to convince me of any
error therein, I shall in the second Edition (God lending me life to set it
out) return him both my thanks and amendment, or else let him con|clude
my face of the same metall with the Plates of these Maps.</P>
<P>Whatsoever can be objected against the <HI>Generall description of Iudea</HI> re|turns
in the particular Tribes, and therefore to avoid repetition we shall
there more properly meet with it. This premised, without further de|lay
(by Gods blessing) we fall on the matter in hand. And can we be|gin

<P>I First take exceptions at your placing the City <HI>Adam</HI> so near
unto <HI>Iordan.</HI> For where it is said, <HI>That the waters which came down
from above, stood and rose up upon an heape, very</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Josh. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>far from the City Adam, which is

you make <HI>Adam</HI> not above three miles from that stoppage
of waters, which is not very far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Very far,</HI> is a relative terme, and accordingly admits of much
alteration. Three miles is little in respect of so many leagues, but very
far in respect of so many furlongs. Attend I pray you the main scope of
the holy Spirit, which was to notifie the place where these upper waters
failed in view of the <HI>Israelites.</HI> Which must be acknowledged within the
discovery of their sight; otherwise the land-mark more obscure, then
the staying of the waters that were dated from it. Where therefore the
<PB N="137" REF="314">
distance is measured in a plain Countrey by the eye, three miles may
well pass for very far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why make you so great a flexure in <HI>Iordan</HI> just at his influx into
the <HI>Dead-sea,</HI> contrary to the nature and custome of great Rivers? In|deed
small brooks like little children goe wadling on one side, their
streams are winding and crooked, because they must run where they
may run, and finde soft ground to receive them. But great Rivers
which doe not finde but make their way, flow generally in a straight
channell, and so it seems should <HI>Iordan,</HI> sliding through a flat, low, and
levell Countrey, and not meeting with any effectuall opposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have sufficient warrant for this my description. <HI>Pliny</HI> saith

to follow the motion of <HI>Plinies</HI> pen, as if because he makes a flourish
with his phrase, the River must fetch a compass with his channell. But
consider, I pray, how in the mixture of all liquours of contrary kinds,
the best liquour (which may be said to lose by the bargain) incorpo|rates
always with a reluctancy, and the same Antipathy causeth here this
crookedness of <HI>Iordan.</HI> This is precisely taken notice of by learned<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">In Plinianis exercit. in Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> Iul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> Solini Po|lyhist. p. 577.</NOTE> <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l|masius,</HI>

<P>You place three severall stations of <HI>Balak</HI> and <HI>Balaam</HI> with

probably all those passages were transacted south of <HI>Arnon</HI> in the King|dome
of <HI>Moab.</HI> It is utterly unlikely that King <HI>Balak</HI> would adventure
his person out of his own dominions, into a strangers (not to say an
enemies) Countrey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>In so short a journey the pains was little, the danger none at all.
For (although on <HI>Balaks</HI> side there might be private&punc; heart-burnings)
there was no open hostility betwixt <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Moab.</HI> Yea we know that
then the <HI>Israelites</HI> had familiarity, much with the men, too<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Numb. 25. 1.</NOTE> much with
the women of that Countrey. I confess the places as described in Scrip|ture
stand (as I may say) equivocally betwixt <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Moab.</HI> But here|in
I have followed the example of<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">In Theat. Ter. sanc. in R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uben.</NOTE> <HI>Adrichomius,</HI> and other good authors,
not to say, that if <HI>Balak</HI> had taken his view in the kingdome of <HI>Moab</HI> of
the people encamping then at <HI>Abelshittim,</HI> he could not at that distance
have taken a discovery of them.</P>

(with a stream in breadth corrivall, if not bigger then <HI>Arnon</HI> it self)

omitted it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible full well of such waters, but cannot be convin|ced
that they took their course through this Tribe into the <HI>Dead-sea,</HI> but
rather conceive they ran onely through the Tribe of <HI>Gad,</HI> and emptied
themselves in <HI>Aroer,</HI> whereof in due time we shall give our best account.</P>

<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I set a certain for an uncertain number: in the originall it is <GAP DESC="foreign"> plurall, and therefore indefinite. In all these comparisons, the
strength of the similitude lies in the nature, not the number of the things.
They deserve not the name of <HI>a flock of sheep</HI> which are under an hundred,
to which the teeth of the Spouse are<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Cant. 3. 2.</NOTE> compared, and nature commoly
allowes not above thirty two.</P>

<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>The City of <HI>Misor</HI> belonging to the <HI>Levites,</HI> and recorded by
<HI>Adrichomius</HI> in this Tribe, is omitted by your oversight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Commendable is his charity to the <HI>Levites.</HI> For whereas <HI>Moses</HI>
allotted them but four Cities in <HI>Reuben,</HI> namely<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Josh. 21. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Kedemoth, Iahazah, Me|phaah,</HI>
and <HI>Bezar:</HI> his bounty bestoweth a fifth, this <HI>Misor,</HI> upon them.
But the poor Priests might well be full lean, had they nothing to feed
them, but this imaginary City, groundless in the Hebrew, and onely
founded on the erroneous Vulgar. Yea generally the descriptions of
<HI>Adrichomius</HI> are guilty herein, that (more made <HI>ad splendorem,</HI> then <HI>ad veri|tatem</HI>)
to render them specious to the beholder (because a lean bald
Map is not so amiable as one filled full) he poulders them thick with
places, rather scraped then gathered, thereby offending the judgments of
the learned to please the eyes of the ignorant. But it is my business to
excuse my self, not accuse him, and consciousness to my own many
faults, commands me to be tender to the errors of others.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can demonstrate, it could not stand on that River, and by
consequence must be more within the Tribe of <HI>Gad.</HI> For, <HI>Arnon,</HI> is noto|riously
known to be the eastern bound of <HI>Canaan&punc;</HI> Now attend what
<PB N="147" REF="315">

shall reach from the wall of the City, and outwards a thousand Cubits round about:
And yee shall measure from without the City on the east side, two thousand Cubits,
and on the south side two thousand Cubits, and on the west side two thousand Cubits,
and on the north side two thousand Cubits, and the City shall be in the middest, this
shall be to them the suburbs of their Cities. Iazer</HI> therefore being a City of the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Josh. 21. 39.</NOTE> Levites, could not stand upon <HI>Arnon,</HI> because they could not measure
three thousand Cubits eastward, for then they should take so much out
of an enemies Countrey, which belonged not to <HI>Israel.</HI> Where we may
also observe, that no sea-town was allotted the <HI>Levites,</HI> because, for
the reason aforesaid, it would have proved less unto them, hindering the
circular dimensions of their possessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are much mistaken in the placing of the City of <HI>Aroer.</HI> The

near to which
<HI>Aroer</HI> was seated, was not (as you erroneously conceive)
<HI>Rabba</HI> of <HI>Ammon,</HI> to which it was neither near, nor in sight, (as he wor|thily

on the right side of the City.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The chief directory in placing this tent is the word <HI>right hand,</HI>
and that relative term is varied, according as the face is setled. If <HI>Ioabs</HI>
face in his journy respected the north, then the east is the right hand
of the City, and then the posture of the tent is rightly placed. However
the best is, a tent is but a tent, no solid or substantiall structure, it will be

Tribe, which justly may have an action of trespass against the foresaid
Author, for depriving it of so considerable a part of its true possession.

overdoe, stretching the inheritance of this Tribe to the utmost, and
most northern part of the sea of <HI>Galilee.</HI></P>

<P>I admire much at your inconstancy. In your Map of <HI>Palestine,</HI>
some seven years since prefixed to your <HI>Holy War,</HI> you set <HI>Iabesh-Gilead</HI>
north of the river <HI>Iabbok</HI> in the Tribe of <HI>Manasseh,</HI> which now you have
translated many miles southward into this Tribe. It seems, you need no other to confute you but your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have seen mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I request this mine answer may be applyed to those many differences be|twixt my for|mer Map, and this present de|scription.</NOTE> error, and you see my retractation thereof. <HI>One
day teacheth another.</HI> To live, and not to learn, is to loiter, and not to live.
Confessions of our former mistakes, are the honourable Trophies of our
conquest over our own ignorance. The main reason, why <HI>Iabesh-Gilead</HI>
could not be so far north, is this, because <HI>Saul</HI> marched from <HI>Bezek</HI> in the
Tribe of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> with an army of foot, in an afternoon and a night, over
<HI>Iordan,</HI> unto this City, and came hither in the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 11.</NOTE> <HI>morning-watch.</HI> Now though
we allow, that zeal to their brethren in danger, spurred on the souldiers,
and did <HI>horse</HI> those <HI>foot</HI> in point of speed, yet they almost needed wings,
in so short a time to goe so long a journey (fifty miles at least besides the
crossing of two great rivers, <HI>Iordan,</HI> and <HI>Iabbok</HI>) and to come thither so
early. Wherefore with master <HI>More</HI> we have placed <HI>Iabesh-Gilead</HI> south

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The strength of your objection consists in the words <HI>beyond

<HI>Isaiah secundum Iordanem,</HI> by the same Author in <HI>Matthew, transitus Iordan;</HI>
by <HI>Beza, secus Iordanem.</HI> The dicision of the difficulty depends on the
proper sense of the preposition <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nebher,</HI> in Hebrew; which barely
imports no more, then <HI>over;</HI> but which way, whether <HI>Cis,</HI> or <HI>Trans;</HI>
whether on this side, or beyond, is to be expounded by the context.
This flexible nature, and promiscuous sense of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Gnebher,</HI> is observed

to attest the antiquity of <HI>Iordans</HI> descent, according to our description,
grudge not to read the following testimony of <HI>Philostorgius,</HI> both because

his book at this day not extant, save that some parcells of his are recited by <HI>Ioannes Antiochenus,</HI> out of whose<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">In part set down by <HI>Sal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">sius</HI> in his notes on <HI>Soli|nus cap.</HI> 35.</NOTE> <HI>Manuscript,</HI> not yet printed, the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>His authority cannot countervaile Saint <HI>Hieromes, Benjamin in
Itinerario,</HI> and others, yea Truth it self, which are on our side, and against
his opinion. For, <HI>Ieroboam</HI> was too good an husband to lavish both his
Calves in one place, which he rather would scatter in distant Cities, the
better to spread Idolatry in his kingdome. Besides, consider the end
pretended at their erection, namely to spare the peoples pains, <HI>It is too</HI>
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 12. 28.</NOTE> <HI>much for you to goe up to Ierusalem,</HI> that these <HI>Calves</HI> should be (as it were)
<HI>Chappels of ease,</HI> to save his subjects a tedious journey. Now, if both his
<HI>Calves</HI> were penn'd up in a stall near <HI>Bethel</HI> (as <HI>Brocard</HI> would have it)
little ease thereby was given to the northern Tribes, and their journey
not considerably shortned. Therefore the other <HI>Calfe</HI> was set up at <HI>Dan</HI>
in <HI>Naphtali,</HI> as we have described it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that you have said, doth not satisfie me, that this <HI>Dan</HI> was
the place where the <HI>Calfe</HI> was worshipped. For, soon after <HI>Ieroboams</HI>
death, in the reign of <HI>Baasha,</HI> this <HI>Dan</HI> you speak of was<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 15. 20.</NOTE> <HI>smitten</HI> by <HI>Ben|hadad</HI>
King of <HI>Syria.</HI> This, probably, would have extinguished <HI>Calfe|worship,</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might argue on the same grounds, that the other <HI>Calfe</HI> was
not erected in <HI>Bethel,</HI> seeing even in the life of <HI>Ieroboam, Abijah</HI> King of
<HI>Iudah took from him</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 13. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Bethel with the towns thereof.</HI> Observable herein is di|vine
Justice, punishing both those idolatrous places by the sword of
their enemies, so soon after the <HI>Calves</HI> were set up in them. But, we may
be confident, the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> recovered both <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel</HI> again, and
restored them to their former impious uses.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give us I pray you an account of them in order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first main Scripture direction we are to observe is, the
<HI>night survey</HI> which <HI>Nehemiah</HI> took of the walls, (or rather ruines) of <HI>Ieru|salem,</HI>
described in this manner:<Q><BIBL>NEHEM. 2. 13, 14, 15.</BIBL><P>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the Dragon
Well, to the Dung port, and viewed the walls of Ierusalem, which were broken
down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. Then went I out to the
gate of the fountain and to the Kings pool, but there was no place for the beast
that was under me to pass. Then went I up in the night by the brook, and
viewed the wall, and turned back and entred by the gate of the valley, and so
returned.</P></Q></P>
<P>The second is the severall reparations (where the same were required)
done on the Gates and walls of the City by severall persons, in a circular
form, from the <HI>Sheep-gate</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. 1. &amp; 32.</NOTE> surrounding the whole City till they returned
to the same place where they began&punc; Whose names we have carefully
inscribed on those portions of buildings, upon which their cost and
pains were expended.</P>
<P>The third, but most materiall, (because most declaratory of the me|thod
of the Gates) is the solemn <HI>Processions,</HI> which the people
divided into <HI>two Quires,</HI> made round about the walls: each of them
measuring a <HI>Semi-circle;</HI> both of them incompassing the whole
<HI>circumference</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and at last joining together in the (best meeting
place) the <HI>Temple of God.</HI>
<Q><PB N="171" REF="327"><BIBL>First Quire, Nehem. 12. 31.</BIBL><P>One great company went on the right hand,
upon the wall towards the Dung-gate, consisting
of half the Princes of Iudah: and Ezra the
Scribe before them. And at the fountain-gate
which is over against them, they went up by the
staires of the City of David, at the going up of
the wall above the house of David, even unto
the water-gate eastward.</P></Q><Q><BIBL>Second Quire, Nehem. 12. 38, 39.</BIBL><P>And the other company of them that gave thanks
went over against them,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Not behind them in place, but somewhat later in time.</NOTE> and I after them, and the
half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the
Tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall.
And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the
old-gate and above the fish-gate, and the tower of
Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the
sheep-gate; and they stood still in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Porta custodiae</HI> or the <HI>Watch-gate</HI> being (<HI>as Vill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> excellently proveth) the <HI>East-gate</HI> of the Temple.</NOTE> prison-gate.

Now I request the Reader with his eye to examine, whether the walls
of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> as designed in our draught, agree not with these directions
of Scripture. To purchase the favour whereof, I pass not for the frowns
of any Authors. <HI>Omne excelsum cadet,</HI> down with whatever dare oppose

<P>The place by you alleadged is difficult, much canvassed by

unto it, that <HI>Sion</HI> it self is solely charactered to be
the City <HI>on the side of the North.</HI></P>
<P>2 Sense. Others make this verse the full description of
all <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> consisting of two principall parts,
by the figure of <HI>Asyndeton</HI> coupled together. <LIST>

<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Chariots must be supposed there, though not expressed for
lack of room. Sure they were no reall horses, which the [idolatrous]
<HI>Kings of Israel</HI> had given to the<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Sun.</HI> For (except thereby be meant a
successive breed, or race) such horses must be extremely old at this refor|mation,
after the<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Compare the foresaid place with 2 King. 22. 3.</NOTE> <HI>eighteenth year of Iosia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> probably set up by <HI>Ahaz</HI> sixty
years since. Besides, it is improbable, that living horses were kept so
close to the Temple, and that <HI>noisome stables</HI> should be so near <HI>Gods house,</HI>
generally set at some distance from mens dwellings. However, I had
rather subscribe, then ingage in a controversie not worth the conten|ding for.</P>

<P>You<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Pag. 391. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> mention onely one <HI>Table of shew-bread,</HI> whereas <HI>David</HI>
made preparation for the<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Chr. 28. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Tables</HI> thereof. And lest so plain a place of
Scripture should be avoided, by the frequent figure of <HI>Enallage, Solomon</HI> is
expresly said to have made<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Chr. 5. 8.</NOTE> <HI>ten Tables and placed them in the Temple,</HI> and it is added not long after, <HI>whereon the</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Ibid. ver. 19.</NOTE> <HI>shew-bread was set.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am confident, there was but one <HI>principall Table</HI> for the presen|tation
of <HI>shew-bread,</HI> whereon, by Gods appointment, the <HI>twelve</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Levit. 24. 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Cakes</HI>
were set in two rowes, according to the number of the twelve Tribes of
<HI>Israel.</HI> Now, if there were <HI>ten Tables</HI> provided for that purpose, the <HI>twelve
Cakes</HI> could not be equally set upon them without a <HI>fraction.</HI> I conceive
therefore the <HI>other nine,</HI> onely as <HI>side-cupboards,</HI> or <HI>Livery tables</HI> ministeriall
to that principall one, as whereupon the <HI>shew-bread elect</HI> was set before
the consecration thereof, and whereon the <HI>old shew-bread</HI> removed for
some time, might be placed, when <HI>new</HI> was substituted in the room
thereof.</P>

<P>To proceed to the Altar. I approve your<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Pag. 394. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> answer taken from
the <HI>Celestiall fire</HI> thereupon, as satisfactory in relation to the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> and
<HI>Solomons Temple,</HI> that so many sacrifices were so suddenly consumed
without any noisomeness. But, the difficulty still remains as touching
the second Temple: where, by generall confession (in default of <HI>hea|venly</HI>)
the Priests were fain to make use of common, and ordinary fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although I beleeve not in full latitude, what the <HI>Iewish Rabbins</HI>
doe affirme; That the <HI>Pillar of smoak</HI> which ascended from the sacrifice,
curled onely upwards in direct wreaths to heaven, without any scatter|ing,
or shedding if self abroad; yet for the main, we may be confident,
it was no whit offensive to the Priests, or people thereabouts. This we
impute to the providence of God, passing an <HI>Act of indemnity,</HI> that none
should be impaired, either in health or wealth, by the performance of
<PB N="174" REF="329">
any service according to his appointment. And, as the land of the <HI>Iews</HI>
was secured from forein invasion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Exod. 34. 24.</NOTE> <HI>during the appearing of all the males thrice
a year</HI> at <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> so the same goodness of God ordered, that his people
should sustain no damage or detriment, either in their purses, or per|sons,
whilest busied in his worship: the main reason that no infection
did arise, no smoak, nor ill savor sented from the fat, offall, and excre|ments
of so many sacrifices offered in so short a time, and small a
compass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say something for the avoiding of noisomeness, but no|thing
in answer, that that common fire should so quickly devour so
many sacrifices, though, I confess the offerings in the second Temple,
nothing so numerous as those in <HI>Solomons.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must totally ascribe this to the <HI>work of the Lord,</HI> who though
not granting this second <HI>Temple</HI> the honour and use of <HI>Celestiall fire</HI> (al|lowed
to the former) yet, in approbation of his own ordinance, indu|ed
common <HI>fire</HI> with more then common activity. As, often in extre|mities,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aleth.</SPEAKER>
<P>As touching this second Temple, the works of the <HI>Rabbins</HI> now

him for pretending to more antiquity, then his age could extend unto.
Though this was but a cavill at Christ, the same may justly be charged
on the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> that the oldest of them extant at this day, (all of them wri|ting
since <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 100. in <HI>Trajans</HI> time) are too late and modern to
give us any infallible information of the second Temple, as which their

the destruction of the Temple. One commonly styled the <HI>Prince,</HI> and

<P>We finde indeed such a <HI>Bridge</HI> (others call it a <HI>Caus-way</HI>) in <HI>Mid|doth</HI>
built on purpose from <HI>mount Olivet</HI> to the <HI>mountain of the house,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bridge from mount <HI>Olivet</HI> to the Temple.</NOTE> whereon

must the arches therein be, to stride over so vast a concavity? What need
of so expensive a structure, seeing an ordinary plank would serve for

<P>Concerning the name whereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solomons</HI> porch.</NOTE> let me adde this (to what
formerly we have<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">In descripti|on of <HI>Zoroba|bels</HI> Temple.</NOTE> written on this subject) that some conceive it so
called, not because <HI>Solomon</HI> ever built it, but because in after ages erected
by <HI>Herod,</HI> it did approximate, or come the nearest in state and magnifi|cence
to that of <HI>Solomons</HI> first founding. Thus <HI>Manna</HI> is termed<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Angels food,</HI>
not because they ever eat thereof, but had they any intention to feed
thereon, better dainties could not be desired by them, or afforded to them:
as this <HI>Solomons</HI> porch (at leastwise in the apprehension of the builders
thereof, well conceited of their own workmanship) was so called, be|cause
as brave, and beautifull, as if <HI>Solomon</HI> himself with all his wealth,
and glory, had been the erectour thereof?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive some carnall reason for the buyers and sellers of
<HI>Sheep and Oxen</HI> in the Temple, (driven out by our Saviour) because men,
to save the tedious driving of them up <HI>in kinde,</HI> brought <HI>flocks and heards</HI>
up in their <HI>purses</HI> to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> (money wherewith there they bought
them) but what use was there of <HI>money-changers</HI> in the <HI>Temple?</HI></P>

with <HI>Shekels,</HI> for their religious service. True it is, the <HI>Roman</HI> coins
were onely currant in common and civill paiments (as appears by
Christs question and the <HI>Iews</HI> answer, <HI>Whose image and superscription is this?

the <HI>Romans</HI> permitting the <HI>Iews</HI> the free enjoyment of their Religion, in
things not destructive to their civill government. Now, seeing the <HI>Iews</HI>
were enjoined by Gods Law, to tender unto him <HI>Shekels</HI> of the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI>

that not empty handed) before the Lord in the <HI>Temple;</HI> whilest the
same was not required of women. Whose exemption proceeded partly
from the infirmity of their sexe, not able to endure so long a journey;
partly to protect their chastity in such a concourse of people; and part|ly
that they might attend their young Children, and family-affaires. For
though God gave them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Exod. 34. 24.</NOTE> assurance, that during their husbands absence,
no enemy should invade the land; yet their tender<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 1. 22.</NOTE> children were not

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me thinkes the place in the <HI>Temple,</HI> where the Sacrifices were
slain and fleaed, seems too small for such a purpose, if all the Paschall
Lambes (computed by <HI>Iosephus</HI> to be thousands) were as the <HI>Rabbins</HI>
will have it) all killed by the Priests in the <HI>Temple,</HI> and that betwixt the
<HI>two Evenings, (i. e.</HI> between three and six a clock in the afternoon) no

<P>I am not bound to finde room for all their Lambes. Sufficeth

performances. And here I alledge the authority of <HI>Philo,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Libro tertio de vita Mosis, <HI>and again in his book</HI> de deca|loge.</NOTE> affirming that
(as undoubtedly at the first institution of the <HI>Passeover</HI> and before the

<P>To salve the matter, (and to reconcile our, with the <HI>Rabbins,</HI>

heightened it self by insensible degrees, being (though a Rise of many
Cubites) <HI>an even ascent</HI> (as I may term it) equally elevated, so that the

clean through the Scripture. But at last, in token that they, by their wic|kedness,
had <HI>out-lawed</HI> themselves of his protection, and he withdrawn

Here under favour, I conceive, these severall Scriptures intend one, and
the same victory, because fought in the same place, the <HI>Valley of Salt,</HI>
whilest the seeming contradictions, in the names of the <HI>Conquerors,</HI> dif|ferent

of this world:</HI> so the sense of <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Land, City, and Temple, is not car|nall,

<HEAD>CHAP. II. What became of the ten Tribes since their captivity, and where
probably extant at this day.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. POlitick was the practice of the Kings of <HI>Assyria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy in trans|planting con|quered people.</NOTE> when conquer|ing
a Countrey, neither to kill the natives thereof, nor to con|tinue
them any longer in their own land, but to transport them into a
far distant Countrey, and in exchange planting other colonies in their
room. For, first to kill them (besides the cruelty thereof in cold bloud)
<PB N="192" REF="338">
had been an improvident act, men amongst them being precious to
people their vast dominions, which otherwise, if empty, had been more
exposed to the invasion of enemies. To continue them in their own
land had not been safe; who, best knowing the advantages thereof,
would on all occasions practice the recovery of their lost liberty; and
therefore to prevent farther disputes, the <HI>subject of the question was taken
away,</HI> and they advisedly disposed of in far distant places. Lastly, the re|moving
them into other parts, and substituting others in their land,
taught both these plantations an immediate dependence on their Prince,
(having no other plea but his bare pleasure for their present possessions)
which made them, (like the Turkish <HI>Timario<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI>) more dutifull at home,
and daring abroad in their undertakings.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. These reasons moved the Kings of <HI>Assyria</HI> to transport the <HI>Isra|elites</HI>
from their native soil. Indeed they, if any people, might term the
land <HI>their own,</HI> having a threefold ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e thereunto; by <HI>Donation</HI> from God,
the supreme Proprietary; by <HI>conquest</HI> of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> the ancient owners;
by <HI>prescription</HI> of more then seven hundred years peaceable possession
thereof. But this <HI>threefold cable</HI> was broken with the weight of their sins,
and so was <HI>Israel</HI> carried away from their<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Kin. 17. 23.</NOTE> <HI>own land to Assyria unto this day.</HI>
Even <HI>Lands</HI> as well as <HI>Goods</HI> are <HI>moveables,</HI> though not from their <HI>Center,</HI>

that their land, now base, and barren, is not worth the regaining:
They answer, when they shall recover their Countrey, the Countrey
shall recover its former fruitfulness; as if God would effect miracles, as
fast as man can fancy them. With them concur some Protestant Divines,
maintaining, that the <HI>Iews</HI> shall be restored to a flourishing Common|wealth,
with the affluence of all outward pomp, and pleasure, so that
they shall fight and conquer <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> [the Turke] with many

Here the Apostle <HI>Iames,</HI> more following the sense, then the words of the
Prophet, as an Expositor, rather then Translatour, renders the possessing
of the <HI>remnant of Edom,</HI> to be, by <HI>seeking after the Lord;</HI> by which Analogy
we collect, that those Topicall promises to the <HI>Iews,</HI> of their conquering
and possessing such, and such places, in, and near their own Countrey,
import onely a spirituall propriety, and shall mystically, not carnally be
accomplished, in their sincere conversion to Christ.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. More probable therefore it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iews</HI> their land will come to them.</NOTE> that the <HI>Iews</HI> shall not come back

the present obstruct the conversion of the <HI>Iews.</HI> First, our
want of civill society with their nation. There must be first conversing
with them, before there can be converting of them. The Gospell doth
not work (as the <HI>weapon-salve</HI>) at distance, but requires some competent
familiarity with the persons of <HI>Probationer-converts.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Iews,</HI> be|ing

the <HI>tempest</HI> ariseth, otherwise smaller vessels would be cast away, which

both together in them in the highest degree, most bold, when most

<HI>Iews</HI> in the Wilderness, T. <HI>Town,</HI> V. <HI>Vaile,</HI> We. <HI>Well,</HI> Wi. <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>The second Column interprets the Hebrew names into English, though great the
variety of Authors in rendring their signification. This party proceeds from the
laxity of Hebrew words admitting sundry senses, partly from the vicinity of Primi|tives,
so that the same derivative may seem to spring from two <HI>roots,</HI> and be <HI>son</HI> (as
<HI>directly</HI> to his <HI>Father,</HI> so) <HI>collaterally</HI> to his <HI>Vncle,</HI> I mean to words <HI>akin,</HI> and <HI>alluding,</HI>
whence the same in probability may be deduced; and this subjecteth it to much
variety of interpretation. In this diversity we have wholly followed <HI>Gregorius Gre|gorii</HI>
in his <HI>Lexicon Sacrum</HI> (as a work meerly expository of proper nams) though
some perchance will say, that what is the credit of the good wife<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Prov. 31. 14.</NOTE> <HI>she bringeth her
food from far,</HI> is sometimes his discredit in his over strained, and far fet derivations.</P>
<P>Expect not here from me, after the meaning of the name, a reason of the meaning,
how conformable to the nature of the place. Many Townes were called so, be|cause
they were called so, <HI>ad placitum</HI> of the first imposer. Other places, when first
denominated, had just reason of the same, but this <HI>kernell</HI> long since hath been eaten
up by all-devouring time, leaving nothing thereof but the <HI>huske</HI> of the empty name
to posterity. Now to fix the Hebrew names the better in our memory, we have
here, and there (as the propriety of our language, and commodities of our Countrey
will admit) inserted some English Townes, as <HI>Synonyma's,</HI> and parallel to the Hebrew
in signification.</P>
<P>The fourth Column is reserved for those texts of Scripture, wherein is made,
either the <HI>first,</HI> or <HI>most important</HI> mention of those plces. As the fifth exhibits the
Map wherein the same are to be found.</P>
<P>The sixth tenders to the Reader the <HI>Longitudes</HI> of most places, and the rest may
be supplied by proportion. But oh, the difference of best Authors herein! As in
populous Cities an <HI>houre</HI> is lost in measuring of time, the <HI>lag clock</HI> about noon
striking <HI>the most,</HI> when the <HI>forwardest</HI> strikes <HI>the fewest:</HI> so a whole degree of <HI>Lon|gitude</HI>
is swallowed up betwixt the difference of Geographers. Yea, so great is the
uncertainty therein, that in most Maps <HI>lines of Longitudes</HI> (as onely for generall di+rection,
<HI>ne toto coelo errent</HI>) serve to <HI>lace</HI> their Maps that they grow not without
<HI>forme,</HI> or <HI>fashion;</HI> but are not reducible to an exact agreement.</P>
<P>More is the certainty of <HI>Latitudes</HI> the work of the next Column, as greater their
concernment in our Description, because effectuall in the length of the days, and
heat of the climate in <HI>Palestine.</HI> It is situated for the main betwixt <HI>thirty one</HI> and <HI>thirty
four,</HI> the longest day being <HI>fourteen houres, and a quarter;</HI> though the <HI>Iews</HI> (as if it
were always <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> with them) divided both day and night evenly into twelve
<PB REF="346">
houres, so that the two overplus houres and the quarter, fell under the nocturnall
computation.</P>
<P>As for the climate of <HI>Palestine,</HI> in summer time it must needs be hot, lying not
above <HI>seven degrees</HI> from the <HI>Tropick,</HI> especially when the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Luke 12. 55.</NOTE> <HI>south winde blew&punc;</HI> But
sometimes God cooled them, by drawing betwixt the Sun and them a Canopy, or
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Isa. 18. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Cloud of Dew in the heat of harvest.</HI> Their winter, though short, was sharp;<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Psal. 147. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>Who
is able to abide his frosts?</HI></P>
<P>Now although such their vicinity to the Sun (lying at the same distance with
some parts of <HI>Barbary,</HI> where the people are tawny) yet the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 17. 42. &amp; 2 Sam. 13. 1. &amp; 2 Sam. 14. 27. &amp; 1 King. 1. 4.</NOTE> (their women
especially) were of fair complexion. Indeed, though the <HI>setting of the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> be the
same, all stuffes take not <HI>die</HI> alike. Besides, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">able faces of <HI>Black-mores</HI> come
not from the Sun, but some other secret cause, plainly appears, because <HI>Ebony</HI>
and <HI>Ivory,</HI> I mean, black and fair faces are found in parallel Climates.</P>
<P>The last Column containes the Book, Page, and Paragraph (save that the fifth
book is divided onely into Chapters) where any memorable mention is made of such places in our Description. Places out of the Apocrypha, and humane writers
we have omitted, which by their own<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">See our first Book. chap. 15.</NOTE> markes will soon insinuate themselves into
the Readers acquaintance, without any farther indication.</P>

<P>REader, be pleased to take notice, that limitary places, and all other mentioned in
Scripture, which we could not confidently refer to another <HI>Letter,</HI> are by us (though
no <HI>Townes</HI>) consigned to T. which as an <HI>Hospitall,</HI> of no less charity, then capacity, gives
them all entertainment. And thus by Gods assistance we have finished our Table. Mi|raculous
almost was the execution done by <HI>David</HI> on the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> who <HI>saved neither
man</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 27. 9.</NOTE> <HI>nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath.</HI> I cannot promise such exactness in our
Index, that no one Name hath escaped our enquiry: some few, perchance, hardly slip|ping
by, may <HI>tell tales</HI> against us. This I profess I have not (in the language of some
modern <HI>Quarter-Masters</HI>) wilfully <HI>burnt any Towns,</HI> and purposely omitted them; and
hope, that such as have escaped our discovery, will upon examination appear; either,
not generally agreed on by Authors for <HI>Proper Names,</HI> or else, by proportion falling
without the bounds of <HI>Palestine.</HI></P>
