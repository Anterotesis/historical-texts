<HEAD>To the LORDS Spiritual and Temporal, and COMMONS in Parliament A&s;&s;embled.</HEAD>
<P>IF we look back, and con&s;ider how often, and to how high a degree His Maje&s;ty hath expos'd His Royal Per&s;on this War; and what immen&s;e Sums of Money have been rais'd during the &s;ame, upon the Succe&s;s whereof not only the well-being of this Kingdom, but the Happine&s;s of <HI>Europe</HI> depends; one would then conceive the very Apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e things was &s;ufficient to beget a generous Principle in all Per&s;ons in Places of Tru&s;t, and an Emulation in every Man to outvy each other in Acts of Duty and Loyalty: But they have had a quite different Effect; for many Per&s;ons in whom the King hath repos'd great Tru&s;t, (forgetting their Duty) have during the Cour&s;e of this War mi&s;repre&s;ented Per&s;ons and Things to His Maje&s;ty, and made a Prey of the Pub|lick; and the better to cover and carry on their wicked De&s;igns, have di&s;pen&s;ed with the Law, perverted Judgment and Ju&s;tice, pu|ni&s;hed innocent Per&s;ons for doing their Duty; and preferred Cri|minals, to the great Hazard of the Common Safety: and from whence it is the Nation is now become &s;o much in Debt.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Evils would I have twice laid open the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament; but was both times prevented by unju&s;t and illegal Means, which cau&s;es me now to addre&s;s my &s;elf to this mo&s;t Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly for Relief: The&s;e Corruptions being, I conceive, of much more dangerous Con&s;equence to the Government, (con&s;idering what a Faction there's in the Bowels of the Nation) than the War it &s;elf; having taken &s;uch deep root, and grown to that height, and &s;o &s;trongly &s;upported, as not to be remedied but in Parliament.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
<P>I humbly conceive there's no Age can produce greater In&s;tances of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice, than what the Nation now labours un|der, and which in part are here &s;et forth: But God hath not left us without Means, Ability, and Opportunity of removing the&s;e Evils; for there are great and remarkable In&s;tances of Per&s;ons (who have been found corrupt, and have made a Breach of their Tru&s;t) that have been cen&s;ur'd in Parliament; and it's they who are truly and properly the Great Council (and Phy&s;ician) of the Nation; and as the Effect of who&s;e great Wi&s;dom and Prudence, we now en|joy our Religion and Laws, and the Government hath been kept &s;o long upon its Ba&s;is. And when God is pleas'd to make publick Examples of &s;ome Men, and to puni&s;h them for their Cruelty and Oppre&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch Ca&s;es he often makes u&s;e of weak and mean In|&s;truments for the bringing his Purpo&s;es to pa&s;s; that &s;o the World may (as it were) vi&s;ibly &s;ee the hand of Providence: But I am not un&s;en&s;ible of my own Inability to manage &s;o great an &V;nder|taking as that is in which I have engag'd my &s;elf, con&s;idering the great Intere&s;t and Power of my Adver&s;aries: So I have nothing to depend upon but the Ju&s;tice of my Cau&s;e, the Goodne&s;s and Sta|bility of our Laws, and the Honour of the Repre&s;entatives of the Nation; which I humbly conceive will not be wanting to protect me, being able by Sub&s;tantial Evidence to prove what I have &s;et forth. I am, my Lords and Gentlemen,</P>

<P>ALL Nations, even the mo&s;t barbarous, have ever been jea|lous of their Liberty; and have rather cho&s;e to die fighting in the Field, than be in Bondage to their Ad|ver&s;aries: And in the dark and elder Times of the World, we have In&s;tances of Per&s;ons that have &s;acrific'd their own Lives for the Liberty and Safety of their Native Country; who are to be admir'd and pity'd, but not imitated: Yet Nature hath &s;tamp'd upon the Minds of all Men, an Affection to their Native Soil; and tho&s;e who have deviated from it, have ever been look'd upon as Mon&s;ters, and treated accordingly. Now, notwith&s;tand|ing the manife&s;t Danger the Government hath lain under during this War, it will appear that many Per&s;ons in Places of the greate&s;t Tru&s;t, have fallen from their Duty, and u&s;ed &s;ini&s;ter and indirect Means to inrich them&s;elves, to the great wa&s;te of the Publick Trea|&s;ure, and hazard of the Common Safety of the Nation: And tho&s;e whom I accu&s;e to have &s;o done, are the Right Honourable the Lords of the Admiralty, Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, and the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for the Sick and Wounded, and exchanging Pri&s;oners at War. But before I enter upon any Matter relating to any of the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall in&s;ert a Copy of a Depo&s;ition of a certain Merchant which was laid before the Lords of the Admiralty, and is as followeth.</P>
<FLOATEXT LANG="eng" TYPE="deposition">
<P><HI>H.

<PB N="6" REF="4"> Town, and other places; and &s;everal Lads bringing up the Mill-Lake &s;ome Pitch and Tar at a di&s;tance from this Deponent's Hou&s;e, and offering him the &s;ame to &s;ale: after &s;everal times he que&s;tion'd where they had it; and one of them, by name <HI>John Hows,</HI> own'd to him they had it out of the King's Stores: He gave them fair warning of &s;uch a dangerous Trade, and forthwith went and inform'd the Commi&s;&s;ioner. And this Deponent farther &s;aith, That he received fourteen Barrels of Tar from Capt. <HI>Richard New,</HI> Foreman of the Yard; of which fourteen Barrels, the Commi&s;|&s;ioner &s;top'd four, which he this Deponent &s;ent over to <HI>Port&s;|mouth.</HI> Upon which, &s;ome Que&s;tion ari&s;ing before the Commi&s;&s;io|ner about 27 Barrels of Tar, &s;aid to be lo&s;t out of the Yard; and he taking the four Barrels to be part of them, order'd them to be carried into Stores, notwith&s;tanding the &s;aid <HI>New</HI> own'd to have had the fourteen Barrels afore&s;aid, and clear'd the &s;ame to him at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> in the name of one <HI>Thomas Grant.</HI> And this Deponent farther &s;aith, That it was here ob&s;ervable, that he the &s;aid <HI>New,</HI> did very unwillingly own the Delivery of them to this Deponent before the Commi&s;&s;ioner, till he was brought under a Nece&s;&s;ity &s;o to do. And farther he &s;aith, When he inform'd the Commi&s;&s;ioner, he u&s;ed great Freedom with him, and remarked to him what Pa&s;&s;ages had fallen under his Ob&s;erva|tion; and told him unle&s;s greater Care was taken, the Nation would groan under its Burden before the War was half over; and that tho&s;e Goods could not be carried off without the Con&s;ent of the Watch: And farther, he admir'd how the Store-keeper could pa&s;s his Accompts. To which, in a &s;lighting manner, he told him, this Deponent, it was all &s;tuff. He farther in&s;i&s;ted, the great Ones &s;et on the little Ones; and as it was none of this Deponent's Concern, he did not de&s;ire to bring Mens Names in que&s;tion, but that it was great pity things was not better look'd after. To which he reply'd, He de&s;ir'd as little trouble as might be; and de|&s;ir'd to bring no body in que&s;tion, and car'd not a Fart for the Service, nor how &s;oon he was out of the Place, for he hinder'd him&s;elf more than his Salary in another Way: That in two or three days after, the Commi&s;&s;ioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Wil&s;haw.</NOTE> &s;ent for this Deponent, and told him his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to con&s;ine him aboard a Yatch: Upon which he de&s;ir'd to know his Crime, and whether Bail might not be taken: To which he &s;aid no. Then he asked him who accu&s;ed him? He an&s;wered, that <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Jonas Pod</HI> had &s;worn they
<PB N="7" REF="4"> had &s;old this Deponent &s;everal Barrels of Pitch and Tar which they &s;tole out of the Stores: And this Deponent de&s;ired to &s;ee them; and the Commi&s;&s;ioner own'd he had given them leave to go away, but he had the Charge again&s;t him, this Deponent, un|der their Hands and Seals. To which this Deponent told him, then he mu&s;t have leave to &s;ay two things: Fir&s;t, that he was a Knave to his Tru&s;t, for letting the Principals run away: And Se|condly, a Fool for expecting to father their Rogueries upon him. And farther, this Deponent &s;aith, That the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioner &s;wore he would &s;top his this Deponent's Mouth; and came to him, and told him he was &s;uch a Pri&s;oner as was &s;eldom or never heard of, for he &s;hould eat, drink, and lie with him, and that he would not part with him this Deponent till he had brought him into a better Humour, or words to this effect: and accordingly car|ried him this Deponent to his Hou&s;e to Dinner, and there took Recognizance for his Appearance; but where, this Deponent knows not. And this Deponent farther &s;aith, That he being in|form'd by <HI>John Hows</HI> and others, that a Parcel of the be&s;t Deals, and &s;ome Tran&s;om Windows, was carried out of the Yard to <HI>Pri|ory</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le of Wight:</HI> In which this Deponent being willing to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, went to the Hou&s;e, and bought four Load of Wheal of the Man that liv'd there: And then viewing the Hou&s;e, &s;aw a quantity of very &s;ine <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> Deals &s;awed, one Part for Wain&s;cot, the other for Flowers, and a great deal of other Stuff. And he this Deponent enquired of the Farmer, whether they were to be &s;old? And he told him they were &s;ent there to repair the Hou&s;e. And this Deponent farther &s;aith, That the Second Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1691, one <HI>David Aldridge</HI> came to this Deponent's Hou&s;e, being on a Sunday; and he this Deponent ju&s;t going to Church, the &s;aid <HI>Aldridge</HI> de&s;ir'd him to drink with him, for that he had &s;omething to &s;ay to him this Deponent: Upon which, he invited him into his own Hou&s;e; and &s;itting down with him, af|ter they had drank, there pa&s;&s;ed the following Di&s;cour&s;e between them. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Aldridge,</HI> I hear you and the Commi&s;&s;io|ner had a &s;ad Cla&s;h on Thur&s;day la&s;t, and every one &s;ays you did him Ju&s;tice, for certainly he's the greate&s;t Rogue that ever came into the Place; and had lo&s;t his Commi&s;&s;ion not long ago, when Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> charg'd him with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Haw&s;er &s;top'd at <HI>Po&s;t-Bridg,</HI> but that he the &s;aid <HI>Aldridge</HI> was prevail'd with by the Commi&s;&s;ioner and &s;ome others, to &s;ay it was only about ten Fa|thom
<PB N="8" REF="5"> of an old Haw&s;er, fit only for Paper-&s;tuff, and worth but two Shillings &s;ix Pence <HI>per</HI> hundred; when in truth he averr'd it to him this Deponent, to be as good as a new Haw&s;er, cut into fifteen Fathom pieces, for conveniency of being open'd, and worth a great deal more Money, which he the &s;aid <HI>Aldridge</HI> declar'd he mu&s;t have own'd if he had been put upon his Oath: But he was met with by Capt. <HI>Wil&s;haw,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Southern</HI> and others, and per|&s;waded to &s;ay what he did, not being upon Oath.</P>

<P>This Depo&s;ition &s;ufficiently di&s;covers to what a &s;ad Pa&s;s the Na|tion is brought, in having the Publick Stores embezzled, and tho&s;e concerned in't that by Duty and Oath are oblig'd to pre&s;erve them. I &s;hall not now go about to &s;ay how ill a Man Capt. <HI>Wil&s;haw</HI> is; it does &s;o manife&s;tly appear in this, and other of his Actions, that he has &s;av'd me the labour of doing it.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall make it obvious to the World, that what he has done is but agreeable to the Practice of the Majority of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, who have either notoriou&s;ly wronged the King, or have all a long &s;upported others that have done it.</P>
<P>But as I have charged three Commi&s;&s;ions with making a Breach of their Duty and Tru&s;t, &s;o I &s;hall relate &s;omething in relation to each Commi&s;&s;ion, yet no more than what has already (for the mo&s;t part) been laid before the Lords of the Admiralty upon Oath, (tho hitherto &s;tifled;) and what has not, I am ready to make ap|pear by good and &s;ub&s;tantial Evidence, and &s;hall be as brief as po|&s;ible in relating the&s;e things; and &s;o only lay down the nature of the Crimes, and &s;ome of the Facts that have been committed by each Commi&s;&s;ion; and afterwards give an Account by what Way and Means I was prevented laying open the&s;e things the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</P>
<P>Yet the Matters were &s;o tran&s;acted, that I cannot put them is that Order I would, but &s;hall place them in the be&s;t Method I can; and fir&s;t lay down the evil Practices committed in the King's Yards.</P>
<P>It is the general Practice in the King's Yards, for the Joiners and other Workmen, to be imploy'd in making of Tables, Che&s;ts of Drawers, Scrutores, and other Goods, out of His Maje&s;ty's Ma|terials, and this by Order of the Chief Officers of the &s;aid Yards. And the Officers do employ Men for making Models of Ships, (and
<PB N="9" REF="6"> other Works) &s;ome of which may be worth 2 or 300 Pounds, that are given away or &s;old. The Iron Work is weigh'd in to the King twice or thrice over;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This prov'd be|fore the Lords of the Admiralty upon Oath.</NOTE> and it is the daily and open Practice of the Workmen and Labourers, to &s;plit new Timber and Plank for Fi|ring, for the Officers of the Yards and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o relate &s;ome Matters referring to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy.</P>
<P>A certain Contract was made with a Merchant on behalf of the King for Stores for the U&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Navy, but the Goods delivered were not of half the Value as by Contract they ought to have been: Yet notwith&s;tanding they were received by order of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Wil&s;haw.</NOTE> Commi&s;&s;ioner upon the place; but an Officer of Tru&s;t &s;eeing how gro&s;ly His Maje&s;ty was abus'd therein, would not admit of it: upon which the Commi&s;&s;ioner highly threatned him, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure oblig'd him to a Compliance; which was to His Maje&s;ty's Damage two or three hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>Another Contract was made, and great part of the King's Tim|ber brought into the Yard as Merchants Goods; which an Officer by the Yard ob&s;erving, refus'd to receive: Whereupon a great Di&s;pute hapned between the &s;aid Officer, and the Commi&s;&s;ioner and other Officers, who were all very angry with him that he &s;hould di&s;pute the Matter; and never left the Affair till they had gain'd their End, which was to His Maje&s;ty's very great Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Another fraudulent Contract was made on behalf of the King; wherein a Per&s;on's Hand was forged, (a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Captain <HI>Wil&s;haw.</HI></P>
<P>All prov'd up|on Oath before the Lords of the Admiralty.</P></NOTE> Commi&s;&s;ioner being con|cern'd) but they were detected therein; yet His Maje&s;ty &s;uffer'd 2 or 300 Pound Damage, and had much more had it not been di&s;co|vered.</P>
<P>A great deal more of this nature might be recited, but I think here are &s;ufficient In&s;tances to convince all Men of the evil Practices of the Navy-board in reference to Contracts.</P>
<P>But to proceed; Sometime after the Embezlement of the King's Stores in <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>-Yard broke out, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Na|vy were at the Admiralty-board; and then and there did approve of the Pro&s;ecution of &s;uch Per&s;ons as had embezled the King's Stores, tho before they had done what in them lay to prevent tho&s;e Di&s;coveries; and u&s;ed their utmo&s;t Endeavour to ruin the Gentleman that was the occa&s;ion of bringing tho&s;e Deeds of Dark|ne&s;s to Light, tho the Facts were &s;o plain they could no longer with&s;tand it: But before that Matter came to trial, there were
<PB N="10" REF="7"> far greater Di&s;coveries; wherein mo&s;t of the Officers of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>-Yard were concerned, as likewi&s;e &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy (as has been related;) &s;o that when the Trial at the <HI>King's Bench</HI> Bar came on, they appear'd in a body in the face of Ju&s;tice to bring off the Criminals (who&s;e Pro&s;ecution they had before ap|prov'd); which they effected by &s;etting up a fal&s;e Book of Loans, and thereby impos'd upon the Court and Jury, (then the Attorney-General could do no le&s;s than bring a <HI>Noli Pro&s;equi</HI> to &s;top all far|ther Proceedings, His Maje&s;ty having been at va&s;t Charge in that Pro&s;ecution and no good en&s;ued upon it); &s;o that there were three other Informations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Wherein a mul|titude of Per&s;ons were concerned as Offenders.</NOTE>, which at that time were dropt, and nothing done therein to this time.</P>
<P>There's another Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o of the very &s;ame Nature: The Mayor of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> was fin'd 200 <HI>l.</HI> at <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> A&s;&s;izes for not returning the Recognizance in his hands: Upon which the Com|mi&s;&s;ioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Wil|&s;haw</HI> now Com|mi&s;&s;ioner in the <HI>Straits.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> &s;ends an Attorney along with the Mayor to go after the Judg to <HI>Salisbury;</HI> where he interceded with the Judg in the Name and by the Order of the Commi&s;&s;ioner to excu&s;e the Fine, which was accordingly done, and the Commi&s;&s;ioner bore all the Charge of that Journey;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All prov'd up|on Oath before the Lords of the Ad|miralty.</NOTE> and the very original Note the Attorney gave him of the Charge, is now in the hands of the Lords of the Admiralty: So this Affair as well as the other fell, and never came to any thing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall relate another Pa&s;&s;age of near kin to the foregoing: A certain Per&s;on here in Town, a Sail-maker by Trade, apply'd him|&s;elf to Sir <HI>Richard Haddock</HI> Comptroller of the Navy, and acquaint|ed him that there were very great Embezlements made of the King's Canvas, to that degree that it was a very great Injury to the Trade in general, by being under &s;old: And he told the Comp|troller how and by what Means the Per&s;ons might be taken with the Goods upon them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov'd upon Oath before a Commi&s;&s;ion of Council.</NOTE> and if he would grant him a Commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid he would undertake the Matter him&s;elf: And after near an hour's Di&s;cour&s;e, Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;lighted it, telling him, That Kings and Princes were born to be cheated; and &s;o there was nothing done therein.</P>
<P>And for Satisfaction of the Navy-board, I can &s;hew a large Li&s;t of Seizures that have been made (no ways relating to the <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s), yet no Pro&s;ecution either again&s;t Buyer or Seller.</P>
<P>But during the&s;e Conte&s;ts, in reference to the Embezlements of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>-Yard, it mu&s;t be acknowledged the Lords of the Admi|ralty
<PB N="11" REF="7"> gave all imaginable Encouragement to &s;uch as were in&s;tru|mental in tho&s;e Di&s;coveries, with a&s;&s;urance of their Favour; which they enjoyed &s;o long as the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> my Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard On&s;loe,</HI> were in Commi&s;&s;ion: but when their Lord&s;hips and Sir <HI>Richard</HI> left that Board, the Scene &s;oon chang'd, and the Intere&s;t of the Navy-board prevail'd: Yet in the end, notwith&s;tanding all the ill Actions of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, their Lord&s;hips might have di&s;mi&s;t all &s;uch Officers their Employment (being under their Juri&s;diction) as appeared to be Criminal, and thereby given a great check to tho&s;e horrid Embezlements that were made; yet nothing was done therein: But on the contrary, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy fell with great Vi|olence upon tho&s;e Gentlemen who had made tho&s;e Di&s;coveries, and &s;u&s;pended them their Employments; and there was Subordination endeavour'd and &s;et on foot by a Commi&s;&s;ioner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Captain</HI> Wil&s;haw.</NOTE>, and other foul Practices u&s;ed again&s;t them (too long here to in&s;ert) whereby to throw them out of their Employments; which after &s;ome time they did effect, yet no Crime (but their Faithfulne&s;s to His Maje&s;ty and their Tru&s;t) could be prov'd again&s;t them: And the Lords of the Admiralty, who ought to have protected them from the Violence of the Navy-board, &s;lighted them, and turn'd them off with all imaginable Scorn and Contempt; and, to add to their Affliction, many of the mo&s;t notorious Criminals were preferr'd.</P>
<P>The Navy-board having by the&s;e foul and wicked Means cru&s;h'd all tho&s;e Per&s;ons that had made any Di&s;coveries of embezled Stores, there mu&s;t from thence con&s;equently en&s;ue infinite Em|bezlements; and from that time I find not any Officer hath dar'd to oppo&s;e them, who have ever &s;ince acted as they plea&s;e without Controll.</P>
<P>But to proceed; Sometime after the&s;e unju&s;t Succe&s;&s;es of the Navy-board, one Mr. <HI>George Everet,</HI> Shipwright, ob&s;erving the great Abu&s;es committed in the King's Yards by the Mens wa&s;ting their Time, and their daily De&s;truction of Timber and Plank, appli|ed to the Lords of the Admiralty; and made a Propo&s;al to them whereby to &s;ave His Maje&s;ty 100000 <HI>l.</HI> or more <HI>per Annum</HI> in the building and repairing the Royal Navy; and gave &s;uch Demon&s;tra|tion and Rea&s;on for what he &s;aid, that the Propo&s;al had a general Acceptation, (being printed, and dedicated to the King and Parlia|ment;) yet notwith&s;tanding, he met with little Encouragement (as will appear by the Journal he has kept) from the Admiralty-board,
<PB N="12" REF="8"> being from time to time delayed: But after much Impor|tunity and Waiting, was referred to the Navy-board, before whom he often offered to prove the great De&s;truction and Wa&s;te made of the King's Timber; and at one time produced twelve Witne&s;&s;es to prove the &s;ame, but they would hear but three of them, and very much ridicul'd what he offer'd, and threatned him with an Action of Scandal, whereby to cau&s;e him to de&s;i&s;t: which not pre|vailing, and he not being under their Juri&s;diction, they found them|&s;elves oblig'd to make a Report, (it being then a Year and a half after he made his Propo&s;al) which was tran&s;mitted to the Admi|ralty: But Mr. <HI>Everett</HI> was not permitted a Copy of it till half a Year after; and tho' it's too long here to in&s;ert, yet it will appear how &s;candalous it was by the Memorial he deliver'd in an&s;wer to it, which is as followeth.</P>

<P>The Navy-board about the middle of their Report, expre&s;s them&s;elves in the&s;e words:</P>
<Q>What Care is taken to prevent the Making and Carrying out any un|lawful Ships, the In&s;tructions before recited have inform'd your Ho|nours,

<P>To which I an&s;wer, That I never declar'd the whole was em|bezled, but a great part of it; and in order to prove this, I did on the Fourteenth of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, lay before the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy a Note containing the Names of near forty Witne&s;&s;es to prove the&s;e and other Mi&s;carriages committed in His Maje&s;ty's Yards: Which being read, their Honours an&s;wer'd, that the Surveyor was not in Town, and that the &s;ame could not be deter|mined without a full Board.</P>

<P>Pur&s;uant to this Order, I did on the 23d of <HI>June</HI> (being Satur|day) attend the Navy-board in the Morning, with twelve Per|&s;ons, mo&s;t of them Ma&s;ter-Shipwrights, in order to prove the

<P>This my Attendance was the 23d of <HI>June,</HI> and the Navy-board's Report is dated the 27th of <HI>June,</HI> which is four days after; wherein their Honours pretended they had not heard of any of the&s;e Mi&s;carriages.</P>

<P>There's no rational Man but will conclude this Propo&s;al of Mr. <HI>Everett</HI>'s practicable, tho the Navy-board took indirect Means to crade it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the De&s;ign of his Propo&s;al is no other but to root out all tho&s;e Evils which Cu&s;tom, and the Corruption of the Age hath produced; and no ways to alter the Oeconomy of the Navy, (as is in&s;inuated in the Lords of the Admiralty, and Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy's Reports upon his Propo&s;al:) So that had it been put in pra|ctice, by this time His Maje&s;ty might have &s;av'd three or four hun|dred thou&s;and Pound. And for the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy to a&s;&s;ert the Building and Repairing of the Royal Navy did not an|nually amount to 100000 <HI>l.</HI> (which plainly appears to be a preva|ricating with Mr. <HI>Everett</HI>'s words) when they knew at the &s;ame time the E&s;timate given into the Hou&s;e of Commons for the Wear and Tare of the Royal Navy for this pre&s;ent Year, was 780000 <HI>l.</HI> as appears by the Votes of the Hou&s;e of Commons, is a mo&s;t noto|rious Fal&s;hood. One would therefore think, any Man that had the lea&s;t &s;park of Honour or Ju&s;tice in him, would have been a&s;hamed to &s;ign &s;uch a Report: And why the Lords of the Admiralty &s;hould keep it &s;o long by them, and not acquaint His Maje&s;ty there|with, I know not; however, it's plain it was never intended it &s;hould have &s;een the light, it being forced from them, and the de|&s;ign being to weary out the Man, that he might wa&s;te and &s;pend his Sub&s;tance, and &s;o be forced to decline. A mo&s;t effectual Way in|deed, and &s;ufficient warning to all Men to take care how they
<PB N="16" REF="10"> offer any thing for the Publick Service, tho never &s;o advantagious. Be&s;ides this Propo&s;al, Mr. <HI>Everett</HI> hath made appear, by a cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, the great Embezlements made in the King's Yards, and proved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Before a Com|mittee of Council.</NOTE> many things in the face of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, and made them eat and drink Shame: Yet &s;till they &s;tand as firm as a Rock, and &s;ay they have done no evil.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sailors be|ing inhumanly and barbarou&s;ly trea|ted, is the only true Cau&s;e why they &s;o much de|cline the Publick Service.</NOTE>The poor Sailers that venture their Lives and Limbs to &s;erve their King and Country, and who are one of the greate&s;t Bulwarks of the Kingdom, have been all along mo&s;t inhumanly and barba|rou&s;ly treated, and they and their Families reduced to a mi&s;erable and deplorable State, particularly by the wicked Practices of put|ting Queries and Runs upon their pay: For among&s;t tho&s;e great numbers that are &s;et on Shore &s;ick, tho&s;e that die, and others that continue &s;ick above thirty days, and tho&s;e &s;ent to the <HI>London,</HI> Ho|&s;pitals for cure, who are thereby di&s;abled to return to their Ships, are for the mo&s;t part made run: Others, who&s;e Ships are &s;ailed before recovery, having gone on Board other Ships, are prick'd run from the Ship they were &s;ent from; and if a Seaman is turn'd over from Ship to Ship, and by that means has &s;erv'd on Board four or five Ships in the Navy, yet if he happens to be prick'd run in the la&s;t Ship he &s;erv'd in, he &s;hall of con&s;equence be prick'd run in all the preceding Ships. By this means a Query or Run takes away a Man's Pay wor&s;e than an Execution; and by the pre&s;ent Practice, no Seaman, or his poor Family, is at any certainty of having the Benefit of the King's Pay; for it is in the Power of the Captain, Captain's Clerk, Pur&s;er, Clerk of the Cheque, Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter, or Clerks in the Navy-Office, when ever they plea&s;e, to put a Run or Query upon any Seaman's Pay, without giving Rea&s;on for &s;o doing, or the Name of the Per&s;on that put it: So that for the&s;e black pieces of Robbery, no one is liable to be called to accompt; but the poor Sailer is kept wholly in the dark, and he or his Wife may wait at the Navy-Office Month after Month, with Petitions to no purpo&s;e, till he has &s;pent all his Sub&s;tance: And when he begins to talk of his being thus cheated and robbed, he is threatned to be tried for his Life as a Mutineer. So that the Barbarity the poor Sailors do, and have &s;uffered during this War, is unexpre&s;&s;ible: The Blood of thou|&s;ands of Families are poured out as Sacrifices to the Covetou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e who&s;e Duty and Place it is to be their Guardians and Pro|tectors. By all which it's plain, that whatever good Laws may be made for the Increa&s;e and Encouragement of Seamen, will prove in|effectual &s;o long as the&s;e Practices continue.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="11">
<P>The&s;e Grievances have been at large &s;et forth in Print by one Mr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> and a Scheme of their true Cau&s;e laid barefac'd be|fore the Admiralty by Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> in a Letter, and a Remedy for them propos'd in Writing to the Admiralty by Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> by order of a Committee of Council; and why there's nothing done, but this Fraud and Robbery &s;till practi&s;ed and &s;upported, is what no rea&s;on can be given for.</P>
<P>Since neither Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI>'s, nor Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI>'s Papers before mention'd, have ever been exploded; the Lords of the Trea&s;ury were &s;o fully convinced of the&s;e Cheats, that their Lord|&s;hips did by Warrant under their Hands in <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, appoint Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> to receive all Informations of Abu&s;es in Paiment of Sea|mens Tickets, which doubtle&s;s would have put a &s;top to the&s;e wic|ked Practices: Notwith&s;tanding which, the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> has ne|ver been &s;uffered to act, and &s;o their Lord&s;hips good Intentions have been wholly defeated: But why their Lord&s;hips have not been able to put their own Orders in execution, is another &s;trange thing to me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now lay down Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI>'s Letter, (before mention'd) by which the Reader will be &s;atisfied as to the Humour and Temper of the&s;e Gentlemen, and after what rate things are and have been carried on: It is as followeth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving con&s;ider'd your Lord&s;hips Commands (to wit), That I lay before your Honourable Board a Propo&s;al to pre|vent fal&s;e Tickets and Powers for the future, I find my &s;elf oblig'd humbly to repre&s;ent the following Particulars, in order to &s;atisfy your Lord&s;hips therein &s;o far as I may at pre&s;ent, not be|ing willing to take on my Shoulders (who am &s;o much loaded already) &s;uch a burden as an effectual Propo&s;al to that purpo&s;e mu&s;t be: Therefore to let your Lord&s;hips &s;ee I am no Stranger to that Practice, &s;uch Proceedings have been open'd to me long &s;ince by Officers of &s;everal Ships; one of which, who&s;e Con|&s;cience was more tender, I remember told me, He trembled when he &s;ign'd the Ships Books, and con&s;idered what the Con&s;equence of a Di&s;covery of this Practice might amount to; and gave me &s;everal In&s;tances, telling me he mu&s;t pa&s;s them or be ruined; and that he was well inclin'd to lay down his Employment to be
<PB N="18" REF="12"> no longer under &s;uch Circum&s;tances: Others declaring there was a Trade in fa&s;hion, and they would take &s;hare in it.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hips mu&s;t find large Demon&s;trations of it by what has pa&s;&s;ed, as well relating to the <HI>Mary</HI> as other Ships: The Di&s;temper &s;o well known, a Propo&s;al for the effectual preventing of it for the future carries no other difficulty with it than the Burden of the Intere&s;t again&s;t it, and might at any time have been redre&s;&s;ed by ju&s;t Men of no boa&s;ted Skill in Bu&s;ine&s;s. And, my Lords, I think there are two at hand from the nature of the Crimes, and their being carry'd on &s;o long: One of which I &s;hall open to your Lord&s;hips, becau&s;e 'tis pertinent (in my weak Judgment) to the other Matters I lately laid before your Ho|nourable Board. For the &s;econd, I pray leave to withhold it for the foregoing Rea&s;on; and becau&s;e, as I would not plow with any Man's Heifer but my own, &s;o am I not blameable to &s;ecure to my &s;elf if I can, &s;ome part of my dear-bought Experience, till it &s;hall be my Duty to reform what I know to be ami&s;s, and can therein be &s;upported.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, it's mo&s;t manife&s;t that the&s;e Practices are not wholly carried on by a Combination of the Officers on Board Ships, (as is alledged) who cover the&s;e Crimes to avoid their own ruin, many of them to my Knowledg dete&s;ting the Trade: It being well known what is, and has been the Practice of the Navy-Office, that if any &s;uch Tickets and Powers happen not to be in the hands of any relating to that Office, yet &s;uch may be found with their under-hand Agents, who tho of little Sub&s;tance of their own, yet can buy up three or four thou&s;and Pound value in Tickets, that being the only way &s;uch Frauds can long pa&s;s, and &s;uch true or fal&s;e meet with no Ob&s;truction: But if any Complaint happens, 'tis no ea&s;y matter to have Right done; which is as plain as the Forgery in <HI>Gawler</HI>'s Bills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Prov'd before the Lords of the Admiralty.</NOTE>, tho committed in the Navy-Office, neverthele&s;s gave occa&s;ion to the Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Navy to promote the very Actor to be Clerk of the Cheque at <HI>Sheerne&s;s,</HI> to avoid other Matters like to break upon him, where he may carry on the Trade at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And if this be the ca&s;e, which I pre&s;ume does fully appear, the mo&s;t effectual Remedy again&s;t the Di&s;ea&s;e is to remove the Cau&s;e, I mean &s;uch of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy who have advo|cated, and pa&s;&s;ed by knowingly, and with de&s;ign, notorious Crimes already di&s;covered; and that done, there will remain no
<PB N="19" REF="12"> difficulty to form what mu&s;t put a period to the&s;e Cheats, and all ground of &s;uch lamentable Complaints as your Lord&s;hips and the Government have been long troubled with.</P>
<P>All which ari&s;e from the barbarous U&s;age the innocent Subject have had, and a want of Tendency to their Complaints, and from fal&s;e and de&s;igned Repre&s;entations of Matters; the Guilty being protected, excu&s;ed, and carried through mo&s;t &s;candalous and obvious Offences again&s;t the Law, and afterwards encoura|ged: which your Lord&s;hips find to be the Practice of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, by what I have long &s;ince and now lately laid before you; in particular, that of the Te&s;timony of the Town-Clerk of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> wherein your Lord&s;hips find a Com|mi&s;&s;ioner, after having u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Skill to &s;tifle &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Di&s;covery, paying the very Charges of di&s;appointing the Go|vernment, and getting off a Fine of 200 <HI>l.</HI> the better to conceal his own and others Crimes.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, I mu&s;t pray leave to relate, as well for the Information of &s;uch of your Members as were not of your Board, as for reminding &s;uch as were at the opening of my Ca&s;e, and on the Proceeds of the De&s;ign again&s;t me by the Navy-board; they no le&s;s earne&s;tly ju&s;tified the well and regular Management of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Yard, than furiou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted me, the better to cover the Mi&s;carriages I in&s;i&s;ted on: In which it al&s;o lies prov'd before your Honourable Board, I rejected an Offer of two hun|dred Pounds Bribe to pa&s;s them, the Per&s;on who made me that Tender (with other Accommodations) being neverthele&s;s pro|tected and preferred by them, tho it's plain both he and his Bro|ther have from nothing advanced them&s;elves to great E&s;tates by &s;uch undue Proceedings: and I was not only advis'd if I de&s;i&s;ted in that Matter, I &s;hould be quieted in my Imploy, but in the very heat of the Pro&s;ecution again&s;t me the Expedient to &s;ilence all that Affair, was propos'd to me, to bring Capt. <HI>Wil&s;haw</HI> to one of my Friends, and &s;et him to rights there: Which being out of my power, it was carried on with the more Heat and Re&s;olution again&s;t me: And at the opening of the Embezlements there, which I had all along complained of, then did meer Shame (for I cannot take it any otherways) occa&s;ion the Navy-board to own the Mi&s;carriages of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>-Yard to be great, and to recom|mend me by the Mouth of Mr. <HI>Sergi&s;on</HI> for Encouragement.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="13">
<P>Which was very &s;urprizing after a De&s;ign grounded on mo&s;t palpable Perjury, and &s;o &s;candalous a Repre&s;entation thereof, yet wor&s;e than the Perjury it &s;elf, from that Board.</P>
<P>And after all this to find &s;everal of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, in the face of Ju&s;tice, bringing off Criminals by a Sham-Book of Loans, and thereby encouraging &s;uch &s;hameful Actions, and per&s;ecuting &s;uch as appear'd on the King's Part, even to the Death and Ruin of &s;ome, mu&s;t &s;urely aggravate the&s;e great Mi&s;|carriages, when it &s;o plainly appears the King is thus cheated by Authority.</P>
<P>I come now, my Lords, to the particular Crimes your Lord|&s;hips have before you; which the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy have &s;tifled or forgiven, contrary to Law; it being a common Practice, and of which there are not wanting yet more In|&s;tances.</P>
<P>And next to the Di&s;covery made by the Rope-makers, in which the poor Men think they have made a fair &s;tep to their own Ruin; however, if it be follow'd it may put a great &s;top to that Trade.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, &s;o long as there are Commi&s;&s;ioners intru&s;ted, who on &s;uch Occa&s;ions brand Di&s;coverers for Informers, Rogues, and Villains, (tho they pur&s;ue Orders and In&s;tructions) and in|courage their being treated as the wor&s;t of Men, &s;etting up fal&s;e and &s;candalous Informations again&s;t them, what end can be put to the&s;e Mi&s;carriages?

<P>I &s;hall now give farther Demon&s;tration of evil Practices in rela|tion to the Navy, by referring to what was publi&s;hed by order of the Lords of the Admiralty, as appears by the <HI>Gazette</HI> of the 7th of <HI>January</HI> 1694, which is as followeth:</P>
<Q>WHereas in pur&s;uant of an Adverti&s;ement in the Gazette of the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, a Paper &s;ign'd <HI>R. W.</HI> has been &s;ent to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, offering to di&s;cover &s;everal Frauds and illegal Proceedings relating to Seamens Pay, in ca&s;e His Maje&s;ty &s;hall be graciou&s;ly pleas'd to extend His Pardon to the &s;aid <HI>R. W.</HI> and others that come in with him to make out the &s;aid Di&s;coveries, for as much as they have been concerned in the &s;aid Offences: His Maje&s;ty being mov'd there|upon, is pleas'd to promi&s;e His gracious Pardon to the &s;aid <HI>R. W.</HI> and the&s;e concern'd with him in the &s;aid Offences; Provided they make out the &s;aid Di&s;coveries, and that they have not been guilty of any thing of the like Nature before.</Q>
<P>There are four or five of the&s;e Adverti&s;ements in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> &s;ome of them by order of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, but all of them to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: And any Man that has but half an Eye, may &s;ee a great deal of Fallacy in them, and that they have only the face of Ju&s;tice, and were never intended to make Di&s;co|veries, but prevent them; as appears by the Clau&s;e at la&s;t, <HI>and that they have not been guilty of any thing of the like Nature before.</HI> Very pretty; there's no Man living but mu&s;t conclude, that tho&s;e who&s;e Con&s;cience will permit them to act &s;uch things, have long practi&s;ed them; and 'tis not probable they will ever make Di&s;co|veries unle&s;s they can &s;it down &s;ecure, and have an ample and full Pardon: Therefore this does but encourage all tho&s;e that are guil|ty of the&s;e Practices, to proceed in the &s;ame, none being &s;ecure that &s;hall go about to detect them.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="14">
<P>Two of the&s;e Adverti&s;ements I read at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, (being order'd to appear there, as you will &s;ee by what en&s;ues) and the whole Hou&s;e was pleas'd to acquie&s;ce in what I &s;aid: And there's no Man &s;o weak, but knows it to be the Practice of all Governments, fully to par|don Offenders (that make Di&s;coveries) who have committed any Crime, even to the highe&s;t nature; and not only &s;o, but often|times reward them, of which we have &s;ufficient Witne&s;s by Per|&s;ons now living: And it matters not what end he has to him&s;elf that makes the Di&s;covery, whether it be thro' Good-will or Ill-will, Love or Hatred, &s;o it conduce to the Publick Good; it's then the Intere&s;t of the Government to give him all due Encourage|ment.</P>
<P>And until we come to act &s;o, we can never think to pro&s;per, but be in danger of ruin. Indeed as things are now managed, they look with an ill face; for notwith&s;tanding all the great Preten&s;ions to Loyalty, and the boa&s;ted Skill of &s;ome Per&s;ons, yet I &s;ay there have been great Di&s;coveries laid before the Lords of the Admiralty long before the&s;e Adverti&s;ements, (in reference to the wronging His Maje&s;ty, and the poor Sailors) but no Pro&s;ecution of the Per|&s;ons that committed the Facts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commi&s;&s;ioners for Sick and Wounded.</NOTE>But I fear I have dwelt too long upon the&s;e Matters, &s;o &s;hall pro|ceed to the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Sick and Wounded: Again&s;t whom, one Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton</HI> exhibited a Complaint, and twice prov'd them guilty, &s;o far as was &s;ufficient to have given &s;ome of them their Pa&s;&s;port (as they have done to many a poor Sailor) into the other World.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t brought his Articles again&s;t them, they were by His Maje&s;ty's Order referred to the Examination of the Lords of the Admiralty; and by their Lord&s;hips they were found guilty of what they were charg'd with: Upon which they petition'd His Maje&s;ty for a Rehearing at the Council-board; which was granted, and they were again prov'd guilty of Breach of Tru&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as appears by the Council's Report. And be&s;ides the&s;e Reports, there are other Matters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whereby much innocent Blood has been &s;pilt, and his Maje&s;ty's Trea&s;ure wa&s;ted; but they are too long here too in&s;ert.</NOTE> of dangerous con&s;equence &s;worn and prov'd again&s;t them, which have long lain dormant in the hands of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Accompts; yet notwith&s;tanding all this, the&s;e Men are &s;till continued in Commi&s;&s;ion, and Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton</HI> deem'd the Offender.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14">
<P>I could lay down more things of this nature; but I am even a weary of raking in all this Filth, which mu&s;t needs &s;tink in the No&s;trils of all good Men.</P>
<P>But I would not have any one now conclude, that all the Lords of the Admiralty, Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, and the Commi&s;&s;io|ners for the Sick and Wounded, are guilty of the&s;e things, for I verily believe otherways: Yet in the mean time, I can do no le&s;s than charge the whole Board, for in the&s;e Ca&s;es the Major includes the Minor; and &s;o there's no hone&s;t Gentleman can be any ways unea&s;y for what I have done, or u&s;e Endeavours to prevent the fair Examination thereof, but promote it, thereby to remove the Scandal he &s;eems now to lie under; for when there comes a Di&s;cri|mination, Truth will appear, as we have an In&s;tance in the late Commi&s;&s;ioners for Licen&s;ing Hackney-Coaches.</P>
<P>And now from all that has been related, it can no ways &s;eem &s;trange how &s;ome Men have arriv'd to &s;uch va&s;t E&s;tates: And if any Man impartially weighs the whole Matter, it mu&s;t even a&s;toni&s;h him to con&s;ider how it's po&s;&s;ible any Government &s;hould be able to &s;upport it &s;elf &s;o long as we have under &s;uch Corruptions, and at the &s;ame time have &s;o great a War upon it: Indeed we only owe the Pre&s;ervation of His Maje&s;ty's Sacred Per&s;on and Govern|ment, to the Providence of God. However, the Nation feels the mi&s;erable Effects of the&s;e Corruptions, by the many great and pub|lick Debts: But I &s;hall leave tho&s;e Gentlemen who have been the cau&s;e thereof, to the Ju&s;tice of God and the Laws of the Nation, not doubting but they will meet with their due Reward, and be oblig'd to di&s;gorge their ill-gotten Goods.</P>
<P>I think we may now fairly conclude, (without any breach of Cha|rity) that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, and their Accomplices, plainly make a Prey of the Publick; and withal, not doubt but the Contracts made on behalf of the King, are for the mo&s;t part frau|dulent; which has prompted them all along to protect tho&s;e Cri|minals that have embezled the Publick Stores, (nothing el&s;e could induce them to do it, unle&s;s they really de&s;ign'd to ruin the Go|vernment, which then mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to have been a mo&s;t ef|fectual way;) &s;o that the Navy, which has been heretofore our Security, is now become a Gulf to &s;wallow the Publick Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>If any Man endeavours to lay the&s;e Evils open, he mu&s;t undergo infinite Difficulties and Hard&s;hips, having a corrupt Party to con|tend withal; who by Time and Intere&s;t have knit and link'd them|&s;elves
<PB N="24" REF="15"> &s;o fa&s;t together, that he's certainly cru&s;h'd by the Navy-board, or their Adherents; or otherways expo&s;ed to the World (as I have been) as a Fool or Madman, or both; and render'd to His Maje&s;ty as a vain idle Per&s;on, and look'd upon with as much Contempt and Scorn, as if he were the wor&s;t of Criminals.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not look upon this ill Treatment to be an Act of the Government, but that it arrives from the &s;ame Fountain all the re&s;t of the Evils have done: neverthele&s;s, &s;uch Proceedings are a Di&s;honour to the Nation and Government, and may at la&s;t prove fatal to them.</P>
<P>Some have a&s;&s;um'd to them&s;elves a Power of di&s;pen&s;ing with the Law: Tho we have good and whole&s;om Laws that are not put in execution, as tho&s;e again&s;t Embezlements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet tho&s;e that en|deavour to have them put in practice, do even run them&s;elves up|on their own De&s;truction, as is &s;een by experience; he that di&s;co|vers any Breach of tho&s;e Laws, being in far more danger than tho&s;e that committed the Facts, which is highly pernicious, and &s;trikes at the very foundation of the Government.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now relate &s;omething I have cau&s;e to remember, and which is not altogether foreign to the Matter in hand. At the fir&s;t opening of the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, begun and held in the fourth and fifth Year of his Maje&s;ty's Reign, I publi&s;hed a Book, en|tituled, <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Glory Reviv'd;</HI> wherein I propos'd an Act of Tunnage for laying &s;ix Pence <HI>per</HI> Tun upon all Coa&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and likewi&s;e laid open the great Evil that attended the laying Embar|go's upon Shipping, (which had been done every Year during the War until that time) giving full Demon&s;tration there was no cau&s;e for it; and &s;o there has been none laid &s;ince, tho far greater occa|&s;ion than at any time before.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Matters here related, (with &s;ome others) I would have laid open the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament; and in order to it, declar'd in Print I could di&s;cover 2 or 300 thou&s;and Pounds of the Publick Money that had been embezled: Whereupon I was order'd to ap|pear at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which I did; and there declar'd the &s;ame, &s;o I had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Honourable Hou&s;e: Upon which I was ordered to withdraw; and in a quarter of an hour's time one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for Taking and Stating the Publick Accompts, came to me in the <HI>Lobby,</HI> and told me I had given great Satisfaction to the Hou&s;e; and that I was referr'd to their
<PB N="25" REF="15"> Board, where I &s;hould be heard with all imaginable Fairne&s;s: But &s;everal Gentlemen told me, that let my Cau&s;e be never &s;o ju&s;t, I mu&s;t expect to be trick'd by that Board, none being more corrupt than they: Which &s;eem'd &s;trange, con&s;idering the care taken in Parliament in the Choice of tho&s;e Per&s;ons; and withal it being well known they had good Fortunes, I thought it morally impo&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould ever be &s;o corrupted as to act any thing again&s;t the Publick Good; yet, to my great Surprize, I found my &s;elf mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But to proceed; in obedience to the Order of the Hou&s;e, I waited on the Commi&s;&s;ioners for Stating the Publick Accompts, and laid be|fore them the great Injury done to the Souldiery by Agents and others in the Clothing of the Army, to the Di&s;couragement of the Souldiery and Hindrance of His Maje&s;ty's Service; and then would have laid before them the Corruptions of the Navy, afore|recited, but they would not receive it, all the Arguments I could u&s;e being to no purpo&s;e. All the An&s;wer I could obtain, was, that it did not lie before that Board; and by way of Deri&s;ion, they &s;aid they might as well examine a Ju&s;tice of Peace why he did not do Ju&s;tice, as to enquire into tho&s;e Matters: But with Submi&s;&s;ion, they &s;hould have pur&s;ued the Order of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which was to receive what I &s;hould lay before them, and make report thereof with all convenient &s;peed; and not made them&s;elves Judges what was &s;it for them to receive: for as His Maje&s;ty and the Nation was injur'd, and the Publick Money and Stores em|bezled, it was their Duty to have heard me, and left the Hou&s;e of Commons to be Judg. But they refu&s;ing to hear me, put me to &s;uch a Nonplus, that for &s;ometime I knew not what to do; and fearing I &s;hould do little in the Hou&s;e of Commons that Se&s;&s;ion, I re&s;olv'd to petition the Hou&s;e of Peers, and acquainted &s;ome of the Witne&s;&s;es with my Intention, who very well approv'd on't. Whereupon I drew up a Petition with five Heads thereunto annex'd, and pre&s;en|ted it to a Noble Lord; which his Lord&s;hip was pleas'd readily to receive and deliver to the Hou&s;e of Peers; where it was receiv'd with much Freedom and Readine&s;s by their Lord&s;hips, and forth|with order'd to be read. And that the en&s;uing Matter may be the better under&s;tood, I have here &s;et down a true Copy of the &s;ame, which is as followeth.</P>

<OPENER>Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT your Petitioner having lately dedicated and pre&s;ented to your Lord&s;hips a Book entituled, <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s <HI>Tears;</HI> &s;etting forth the great Abu&s;es committed in the Government by Per&s;ons in Places of Tru&s;t, and al&s;o the Embezlement of the Publick Trea&s;ure, to the great Hazard of the common Safety of the Nation: And your Petitioner having in the Paper annex'd, drawn up &s;ome part of the &s;aid Mi&s;carriages and Grievances that the Nation now labours under, relating to the Royal Navy, and being ready by good and &s;ub&s;tantial Evidence to prove the &s;ame before this mo&s;t Honourable Hou&s;e:</P>
<P>Your Petitioner therefore mo&s;t humbly prays that your Lord&s;hips will plea&s;e to hear and examine the &s;aid Grievances, that the Offenders may have &s;uch Puni&s;hment, and the great Numbers that are oppre&s;&s;ed &s;uch Relief, as to your Lord&s;hips Wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem meet.

<P N="1">1. That the pre&s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners for Sick and Wounded Seamen, and Exchanging Pri&s;oners at War, (depending on the Admiralty) not regarding In&s;tructions, or the Good of the Go|vernment, have committed gro&s;s Ennormities; as Holding or Conniving at an unlawful Corre&s;pondence with the French, and Wronging both the King and Subject in their Accompts, with other great Mi&s;carriages: All which has been about a Year &s;ince laid in Writing before the Secretary of State by one Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton,</HI> and by the King's Command examin'd before the Lords of the Admiralty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it will appear, that the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion

<P N="2">2. That the Lords of the Admiralty, and Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, have acted contrary to the Publick Good, by countenan|cing, &s;upporting, and preferring Criminals; and on the contrary, per&s;ecuting the Di&s;coverers, and turning ju&s;t Men out of their Offices.</P>
<P N="3">3. That their Lord&s;hips have had great Di&s;coveries laid before them of Embezlements, and other great Frauds committed in the King's Yards, attended with Forgery and Perjury.</P>
<P N="4">4. That it is manife&s;t &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy have in that Office advanced them&s;elves from Salaries of 30 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> to va&s;t E&s;tates, having pa&s;&s;ed great Frauds, and total|ly di&s;couraged the Di&s;covery of embezled Stores, to the great wa&s;te of the Publick Trea&s;ure.</P>

</FLOATEXT>
<P>Upon the Reading of this Petition, Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton</HI> and I were call'd to the Bar of the Hou&s;e, to know if we could make good what I had &s;et forth, (in reference to the fir&s;t Head): Which we a&s;&s;er|ting, in a little time their Lord&s;hips were pleas'd to order me to give in a Li&s;t of my Witne&s;&s;es; which I did in part, and &s;o pro|ceeded to the Examination of &s;ome of them upon the fir&s;t Head, which was done with all imaginable Fairne&s;s. But there being &s;ome Depo&s;itions, and other Papers in the hands of the Commi&s;&s;io|ners of Accompts, which I de&s;ired might be tran&s;mitted to the Hou&s;e of Peers: They thereupon &s;ent their Secretary with &s;ome Papers, who &s;aid the Depo&s;itions were long, and would be &s;o vo|luminous as they had not lea&s;ure to draw them out; &s;o begged the Favour they might have the Examination of the Matter: Which was &s;oon granted by their Lord&s;hips, and an Order accordingly i&s;|&s;ued out, bearing date the 20th of <HI>March,</HI> for their taking the Exa|mination of the fir&s;t Head; and for them to make their Ob&s;erva|tions upon the &s;ame, and to tran&s;mit both to the Hou&s;e of Peers. And by another Order of the 21&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> they were order'd to take the Examination of the &s;econd and third Heads, and then to tran&s;mit the &s;ame to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="17">
<P>But when I came to under&s;tand that the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Ac|compts had drawn this Matter to them again, which they had be|fore rejected, I had ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear they had a De&s;ign to prevent the Di&s;covery of all the&s;e evil Practices; yet how to help my &s;elf I knew not, not knowing how corrupt that Board might be: All which put me to a great &s;tand, fore&s;eeing I &s;hould be baffled.</P>
<P>But I cannot omit relating one remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, which is worthy of Ob&s;ervation: Upon the Reading my Petition in the Hou&s;e of Peers, and Order being given to call me to the Bar of the Hou&s;e, and a Door-keeper calling me with a loud Voice, one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Publick Accompts then accidentally pa&s;|&s;ing by, and hearing my Name call'd, met me in the Painted-Chamber ju&s;t as I was going into the Hou&s;e, (an hone&s;t Gentleman, only has wanted Re&s;olution to with&s;tand the Charms of the&s;e <HI>Si|renes</HI>); who &s;eem'd to be in great Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order of Mind, and was taken with &s;uch a Fit of Trembling as <HI>Bel&s;hazzer</HI> was when he &s;aw the Hand-writing upon the Wall, not being able to hold one Joint &s;till; and asked me if I accu&s;ed the Ju&s;tice of their Board? But I &s;oon put him out of his pain by a&s;&s;uring him I did not; only I did &s;eek for Relief and Ju&s;tice, which I could not ob|tain at their Board.</P>
<P>Thus we may &s;ee when Men are &s;urprized, and a Guilt attends their Actions, how all their little Arts and Intrigues fail them.</P>
<P>But to return; Finding my &s;elf oblig'd to proceed with the&s;e Gentlemen the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Aecompts, Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton</HI> and I wai|ted on one of them at his Hou&s;e, whom we knew to be a leading Man at that Board; and acquainted him that we had not been well treated by their Board before, yet hoped we might now have things fairly examined. He bad Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton</HI> (who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was fir&s;t to come on) not trouble him&s;elf with what was pa&s;t, he &s;hould be fairly treated; for, &s;ays he, we'll take care to put our Finger upon the right place, (that was his Expre&s;&s;ion.) Which I mu&s;t confe&s;s they did to the purpo&s;e, but to a wrong end, having thro' the whole Cour&s;e of this Examination &s;hew'd much Inju&s;tice and Partia|lity; for when they went upon the Examination of the fir&s;t Head, they brought three Informations (I can call them by no other name) again&s;t Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton;</HI> the Con&s;equence of the fir&s;t being High-Trea&s;on, and put him upon his Oath to clear him&s;elf from the other two: And when I waited on the&s;e Gentlemen fir&s;t, be|ing the 23d of <HI>March,</HI> I de&s;ir'd that the Witne&s;&s;es as to the &s;econd
<PB N="29" REF="17"> and third Heads, might have Precepts i&s;&s;ued out for them, many of them living in the Country at a great di&s;tance: Upon which the Board did a&s;&s;ure me they would take care it &s;hould be done; and as we proceeded upon the fir&s;t Head, I de&s;iring to know whether the Witne&s;&s;es were order'd to appear in relation to the &s;econd and third Head, was &s;everal times an&s;wer'd, Care was taken therein; but I &s;ound it otherways, there being no Precepts i&s;&s;ued out for any Witne&s;&s;es in the Country till the 12th of <HI>April:</HI> Yet during the time of examining the fir&s;t Head, the Board &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> here in Town, who was a Witne&s;s to the &s;econd and third Head; and cau&s;ing them to be read, asked him what he knew concerning them? He &s;aid he knew them to be true, and that they would be fully prov'd by good and &s;ub&s;tantial Evidence, and that things would appear to be much blacker than they were repre&s;ented: With which they &s;eem'd to be well pleas'd, and upon the 18th of <HI>April</HI> we began to examine Witne&s;&s;es upon the &s;econd and third Head, and ended the 19th of the &s;ame Month; the Board declaring they bad &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s upon them, they could proceed no farther that Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament. So there was little Progre&s;s made there|in, the mo&s;t material Witne&s;&s;es not being examin'd: But during the Examination of the&s;e things, the Board did what in them lay to ri|dicule the whole Affair; and one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners who &s;aid he'd lay his Finger upon the right place, affirm'd the whole Matter was but a Contrivance of Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI>'s, and nothing in it. I ac|quainted Mr. <HI>Trevor</HI> with it; who afterwards told the Commi&s;&s;io|ners that a Gentleman of that Board had &s;aid that tho&s;e Arti|cles I had brought were a Contrivance of his: He &s;aid whoever did it acted very unworthily, for that it was none of his doing; and offer'd them his Oath, &s;aying he had laid his Matters el&s;ewhere: and farther told them, the Articles were true if they had but a mind to hear them: Upon which, the whole Board was &s;ilent, not one Man making any Reply; and the Gentleman who &s;poke the words hung down his Head as if he had been a&s;leep, not that he valued what was &s;poken, but his Con&s;cience &s;mote him.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Things remain'd without any farther notice, till <HI>July</HI> the 12th, when I receiv'd a Letter from their Secretary, requiring me to be at the Office the 18th: Where I did appear, and &s;ent in my Name to the Board: Upon which, their Secretary came to me with a Me&s;&s;age; which I did not think fit to receive from him, &s;o &s;ent in my Name again, de&s;iring to know if they had any farther
<PB N="30" REF="18"> Commands. Whereupon I was call'd in, and told by the Chairman, that if I knew of any Per&s;ons that were guilty of any Crimes (in relation to tho&s;e Articles I had brought) that were not within His Maje&s;ty's late Act of Grace, if I would lay it before that Board, I &s;hould be heard: This was twice repeated to me, for fear I &s;hould forget it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Some Per&s;ons have left the good old Way, and made new Paths to them&s;elves; fir&s;t cru&s;h a Man, then by their E|mi&s;&s;aries, &s;pread abroad he can prove nothing: yet we &s;ee Time and Patience brings Truth to light, to the Shame and Di&s;|honour of its Repugners.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But now, with the&s;e Gentlemens leave, neither they nor I had any thing to do with the Matter, as to judg who was pardon'd and who was not; therefore this was only an Eva&s;ion to prevent the farther opening thereof: for as the Articles were brought before the Act of Grace was pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o with Submi&s;&s;ion it was their Duty to have receiv'd the whole Information; and if any Per&s;ons were afterwards found to be criminal, and within the Act of Grace, it were &s;ufficient for them to plead it; and then the Nation might know and &s;ee who it was had abus'd them for &s;o many Years run|ning, and for the future take care to prevent the like Evils.</P>
<P>But this Method taken by the&s;e Gentlemen, was a Means utterly to overthrow all Di&s;coveries of this kind; and the Kingdom like to be cheated, and kept as much in the dark as it has been hitherto.</P>
<P>For &s;hould I have proceeded only upon &s;ome part, it would have appear'd but a lame ob&s;cure Bu&s;ine&s;s, (e&s;pecially as it might have been manag'd by them;) &s;o in cour&s;e it would be thrown out and rejected by the Hou&s;e of Peers as a Matter frivolous and idle: and if I did not proceed, it were &s;till the &s;ame, (I having &s;ix Months time to do it in) their Lord&s;hips might then with a great deal of Ju&s;tice throw it out; and after that no Puni&s;hment would be thought too great for me.</P>
<P>Therefore the&s;e Gentlemen have put me upon a Nece&s;&s;ity of pub|li&s;hing the&s;e things; not only in reference to my own Safety, but in Ju&s;tice to my Native Country: And I am &s;orry they, of all Men, &s;hould not behave them&s;elves more like Engli&s;hmen, having all a|long had the Character of being worthy Patriots of their Country.</P>
<P>For if we may judg of things by the Actions of the&s;e Gentlemen and others, it's a grand Que&s;tion, whether there's any &s;uch thing as Religion, or we have any Laws or no? And by the &s;ame Rule di&s;putable, whether I am a Man or a Woman? But let us not thus deceive our &s;elves; for we mu&s;t never expect to pro&s;per until we make Duty, and not Intere&s;t, the Rule of our Actions.</P>
<P>And altho' God has been pleas'd to give Succe&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's arms this la&s;t Campagn, yet it can be no Argument for the Conti|nuance
<PB N="31" REF="18"> of the&s;e Corruptions, thereby to oppre&s;s the Nation and gra|tify the Appetite of particular Per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Jeremiah 5.26, 27, 28, 29.</HI> wherein is lively &s;et forth our pre|&s;ent State and Condition, &s;o worthy the Pe|ru&s;al of every Man.</NOTE>, Matters being &s;till dubi|ous, the War not being brought to a period; but the Event thereof uncertain, and the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Government apparently great: therefore we can no ways infer from thence the War will have a happy I&s;&s;ue; but may rather ju&s;tly conclude, in the end God will puni&s;h us if we maintain and &s;upport &s;uch Cruelty and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, if by the&s;e evil Practices the Nation &s;hould be thrown into a Civil War, (which is no unrea&s;onable Suppo&s;i|tion, but what we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear, con&s;idering what a Facti|on we have in the very Bowels of us, which the&s;e Corruptions nouri&s;h, and from whence they gain &s;trength;) none probably would be more ready to draw their Sword in defence of their Coun|try, than the Authors and Abettors of the&s;e Corruptions: From whence we may &s;ee the Frailty of Humane Nature, and the mi&s;e|rable Effects of Pride, Ambition and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, which darkens the Under&s;tandings of Men, while they make &s;uch eager pur&s;uit af|ter Riches; and it's that which hath produced all the&s;e great E|normities.</P>
<P>If the&s;e things are pa&s;&s;ed over with Silence, the Nation can have no Security, by rea&s;on it will embolden Offenders, and excite and prompt others to commit the like Crimes <HI>ad Infinitum:</HI> For it's &s;een by Experience, the Generality of Mankind are more inclined to follow Example than Precept; but the fear of the Law and Puni&s;h|ment to en&s;ue, puts a Bridle upon the Appetite and De&s;ires of Men, and keeps them clo&s;er to their Duty than the Dictate of Con&s;cience does; and that excellent Saying of <HI>Polybius</HI> ought never to be for|gotten: <HI>I believe</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that Nature her &s;elf has con&s;tituted Truth as the &s;upream Deity, which is to be ador'd by Mankind; and that &s;he has given it greater force than any of the re&s;t: for being oppos'd, as &s;he is on all &s;ides, and Appearances of Truth &s;o often pa&s;&s;ing for the Thing it &s;elf, in behalf of plau&s;ible Fal&s;hoods; yet by her wonderful Operation &s;he in&s;inuates her &s;elf into the Minds of Men, &s;ometimes exerting her Strength imme|diately, and &s;ometimes lying hid in Darkne&s;s for Length of Time; but at la&s;t &s;he &s;truggles through it, and appears triumphant over Fal&s;hood.</HI></P>
