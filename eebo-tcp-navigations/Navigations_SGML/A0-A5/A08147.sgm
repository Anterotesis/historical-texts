<P>_THis Citie is every where exceedingly for|tified, and amended. Great feare al&s;o is conceived in this place, wherefore, men tran&s;port their goods and flie to <HI>Vienna.</HI> For the Duke of <HI>Saxons</HI> Forces are en|quartered in this Kingdome of <HI>Bohe|mia,</HI> and doe encroach day by day vpon vs. As al&s;o the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> are fallen into <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> at lea&s;t fifteene thou&s;and &s;trong, where they haue taken <HI>Great Glogaw</HI> of late and divers other places of moment. Yea they haue &s;hew|ed them&s;elues in a victorious manner, even before <HI>Bre&s;lau.</HI> Which hath cau&s;ed the Emperours forces mainly to intend again&s;t them. Who with all expedition are marching to|wards them.</P>
<P>His Imperiall Maje&s;tie this day, as al&s;o divers times of late him&s;elfe in per&s;on hath beene pre&s;ent in the Coun&s;ell of Warre, and with them con&s;ulted, how and by what meanes a mightie Armie may &s;peedily be rai&s;ed. To this effect the Lord <HI>Que&s;tenburg</HI> is &s;peedily &s;ent to the Duke of <HI>Freid|land,</HI> and Commi&s;&s;ions are graunted from his Imperiall Ma|je&s;tie, for the levying and rai&s;ing of an hundred thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The Chancelor of the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> Lord of <HI>Eu|dern,</HI> who had with him many confi&s;cated goods in <HI>Ellen|boger</HI> Countrey; was &s;urprized in the night, carryed away; and the &s;aid goods are re&s;tored to the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>La&s;t weeke the Imperiall Commaunder <HI>Bunnickhou&s;en,</HI> with his Cavalleries, fell vpon &s;ome of his Maje&s;tie of <HI>Swe|dens</HI> forces, and defeated them in a certaine Village where they lay.

<P>From <HI>Erfort</HI> is confirmed that &s;ince his Maje&s;tie of <HI>Swe|den</HI> hath taken the &s;ame Citie, it is exceedingly oppre&s;&s;ed with Garri&s;ons, more then the Citie is able to beare. Here|upon tho&s;e of the Citie by their Committies, haue made humble &s;ute to his Maje&s;tie of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the end they might be ea&s;ed and disburdened of &s;o intollerable a Charge.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;tie intends to &s;end his Queene thither to re&s;ide there, whom they daily expect. Others are of opinion, that the Queene &s;hall keepe her re&s;idence in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wirt&s;|burg,</HI> which indeed is a &s;trong and Royall Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In all parts here abouts, are levied all Souldiers that vpon any termes will beare Armes, both hor&s;emen and foote.</P>
<P>Two dayes agoe we heard a great thundring of &s;hooting. Whereupon we doe pre&s;ume, that the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Ar|my, and the Generall <HI>Tillies</HI> Army, haue had &s;ome &s;ore en|counter neare vnto <HI>Mergenheym,</HI> which is very probable to be &s;o.</P>

Some of <HI>Tillyes</HI> Souldiers who are impri&s;oned by the <HI>Swedi&s;h,</HI> affirme, that there is exceeding great want in the Popi&s;h Army, both of Victualls and other provi&s;ion. Whereupon the Souldiers doe faint, and let their courage &s;inke. They confe&s;&s;e that many impotent forces are aggregated confu&s;edly together, but to no great purpo&s;e, neither in any good order. Neither are they able to furni&s;h their Armie with Ordnance and Munition, &amp;c. &s;ince that horrible overthrow neare vnto <HI>Leip&s;ich.</HI> E&s;pecially they are weakened exceedingly, becau&s;e his Maje&s;tie of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath taken (of late) <HI>Wirt&s;burg,</HI> and other &s;trong places, furni&s;hed with all manner of nece&s;&s;aries.

<HEAD>From <HI>Hanaw</HI> the <HI>11.</HI> of <HI>November.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I doubt not but you haue heard how this Citie hath beene &s;urprized and taken by the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> forces. Giue me leaue briefly to relate it vnto you, if happily you are not ac|quainted with the manner of it.</P>
<P>In the morning early, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1. three thou&s;and <HI>Swedi&s;h
<PB N="4" REF="5">Dragoners</HI> (Mu&s;quetiers on Hor&s;ebacke) and &s;ix hundred <HI>Cura&s;&s;iers,</HI> came before this Citie, and entred and pa&s;&s;ed through the Kinzing gate, where they patarded the Gate be|hinde the Ca&s;tle, and &s;caled the wals, &s;o that by the&s;e meanes they &s;oone ma&s;tered the Old Citie. In this furious a&s;&s;ault and expedition, onely eight Citizens and three Souldiers were &s;laine, be&s;ides &s;ome other hurt.</P>
<P>The Earle of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding his Counte&s;&s;e was then in Labour, or at lea&s;t-wi&s;e newly brought to bed of a young daughter) was pre&s;ently taken in hold. And pre&s;ent|ly after a&s;&s;aulted the New Citie furiou&s;ly, and battered vpon the &s;ame with Canon &s;hot. Tho&s;e within re&s;olved to defend them&s;elues to the vttermo&s;t. But being threatned with &s;ore threats, were at la&s;t willing to come to agreement, appealed to the Earle, and required his con&s;ent, who came to them vpon the walles of the Citie, and &s;pake to them in the Citie, in this manner.</P>
<P>My faithfull and loving Citizens and Souldiers, to affoord you much Coun&s;ell in this extremitie, or any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I am not able, by rea&s;on I am a pri&s;oner. Onely this I wi&s;h you to compound and make your agreement vpon the be&s;t termes you can. Which they willingly con&s;ented vnto, and did &s;o. And tho&s;e that would betake them&s;elues into the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;tie were entertained; the re&s;t were impri&s;oned. His Maje&s;tie of <HI>Sweden</HI> him&s;elfe in per&s;on was not in this ex|pedition, but is daily expected at <HI>Hanaw,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h order according to his Royall Direction.</P>
<P>The forces of the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> which were enquartered at <HI>Heuxt, Hof&s;teym,</HI> and other places hereabout, haue aban|doned their Garri&s;on, and are fled to <HI>Mentz.</HI> The <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> haue al&s;o taken <HI>Fryburgh.</HI></P>
<P>As many Forces as po&s;&s;ibly can be are rai&s;ed for the <HI>Ca|tholicke League,</HI> in this their extreame need, and to this end divers Officers are &s;ent into the Land of <HI>Liege,</HI> to levie &s;ome Troupes.</P>
<P>The Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> is now al&s;o about to levie an Army of 20000 men. And as we are credibly enformed, the
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y">Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cullen</HI> him&s;elfe in per&s;on will come into the field with his new Army.</P>
<P>We haue ty dings that the City of <HI>Stra&s;burgh</HI> is agreed with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> likewi&s;e <HI>Norinburgh, &V;lme</HI> and other Cities are upon termes of compo&s;ition.

The &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ary met in his journey with a Wagon full of Spirituall Per&s;ons, neare vnto the City <HI>Vlms,</HI> all which he tooke hold of, and ran&s;omed them afterwards for 40000 Rix-Dollars.</P>

<P>His <HI>Maie&s;tie</HI> tooke along with him from this place, 4 Companies, and as many as he could well &s;pare from &s;ome other places, by rea&s;on he had information that the <HI>Imperiall Forces</HI> were &s;peedily marching toward <HI>Carel&s;tadt,</HI> again&s;t the &s;ayd new rai&s;ed Army.

<P>In the mean while tis a great mi&s;ery that befals the&s;e Coun|tries, and none without pitty or compa&s;&s;ion can either be|hold or heare of the ruines in the&s;e Parts.

<P>For newes, by the Letters come this day from <HI>Ger|many:</HI> &s;ome men have writte from <HI>Norimbergh,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Saxonyes</HI> forces &s;hould have taken in <HI>Prague,</HI> it doth agree with that one writteth me from <HI>Hambrough,</HI> how that the D. of <HI>Saxony</HI> with his whole Army was entring into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was within 7. leagues of <HI>Prague,</HI> (it &s;hould &s;eeme Count <HI>Thurne</HI> was the leader of them) the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI> continues in his late conquered places, where he makes him&s;elfe &s;trong, and gathers in great con|tributions
<PB N="10" REF="8">in the Townes and Countries therea|bouts; <HI>Tilly</HI> hath a great number of men, but mo&s;t of them unexperienced in warres: the King hath &s;ent the Count of <HI>Solmes</HI> into <HI>Franck|fort,</HI> to have their pre&s;ent re&s;olution, whether they will take in his &s;ouldiers to Garri&s;on; <HI>Tilly</HI> hath &s;ent one to them to per&s;waded them to take in the Emperors Souldiers, they would be happy if they could refu&s;e both and remaine neutrall and friend to both; but it &s;eemes they mu&s;t re&s;olve the one or the other; judge you in what a predicament they live, for they would faine hold with the &s;tronge&s;t, and that is doubtfull, &s;o long as they have both &s;trong Armies in the field: It &s;hould &s;eeme, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Breame</HI> takes time while time is, and begins to put the Emperors Souldiers out of his Iu|risdiction. Many doe write that the neather Circle of <HI>Saxony,</HI> will have 12000. men in the field, and the <HI>Hance</HI> Townes like to Arme them; &s;o that by all appearance this next Summer all <HI>Germany</HI> will be up in Armes: for particular fightings, many write of many, but they are farre from hence, and therefore forbeare to write of any of them: It &s;hould &s;eeme the <HI>French</HI> are already marching towards <HI>Italy,</HI> they &s;ay to put into Garri&s;on; I doe believe &s;o till the next Spring, and then will &s;how their intents; for there is a generall opinion they will joyne with <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the next Spring goe into <HI>Italy:</HI> and make a pretended warre again&s;t <HI>Germany,</HI> and get <HI>Mil|laine</HI> if they can; the next yeare is like to be bloo|dy, God &s;end a good peace to prevent &s;o great a bloud&s;hed as is like to be.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of another Letter of the <HI>18.</HI> of November. <HI>1631.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BY Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance the old Count of <HI>Thurn,</HI> com|manding &s;ome <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> forces and &s;econded by &s;ome troupes of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and accompa|nied with many Bohemian Lords and Noble-men, that by the Emperour were bani&s;hed, tooke with|out any oppo&s;ition the Metropolitan City of <HI>Prage,</HI> of who&s;e comming as &s;oone as the Governour of the Ca&s;tle and the other of the Towne had notice, they both with many more chiefe Mini&s;ters and Of|ficers had no mind to &s;tay for that Earle his com|ming, but &s;aved them&s;elves by flight.</P>
<P>They were followed by many Ie&s;uites, Fryars and Prie&s;ts, who all went towards <HI>Pa&s;&s;an</HI> and into <HI>Au|&s;tria.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Fridland (Wal&s;teyn)</HI> did indeed &s;hew great di&s;plea&s;ure at their flight. But &s;oone af|ter he him&s;elfe and <HI>Don Balthazor</HI> (who commands all the milice and gari&s;ons in Bohemia) faining as if they would goe foorth to meete and parly with the &s;aid Earle of <HI>Thurne,</HI> they were no &s;ooner out of towne but went al&s;o away as fa&s;t as they could towards <HI>Budwize.</HI> Therefore &s;ome of the Swedi&s;h Army joyning with many Bohemians, who are glad of &s;o good an opportunity to free them|&s;elves againe from the in&s;upportable yoke, both their con&s;ciences and goods are under, doe follow them, to hinder them to make any con&s;iderable Ar|my. Almo&s;t all Townes doe openly reioyce and de|clare for them, and &s;o all <HI>Bohemia</HI> doth make a ge|nerall in&s;urrection, in manner, that where&s;oever the people meetes with an Imperiall &s;ouldier, or whom they doe but &s;u&s;pect to be an Imperiali&s;t, they pre|&s;ently knocke him downe.</P>
<P>And how this new conque&s;t doth plea&s;e the Duke
<PB N="12" REF="9">of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the Emperour him&s;elfe, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed. The &s;aid Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> being rea|dy with about 12. thou&s;and men to draw and march towards the Papi&s;ts Army (for the Imperiall and Leagui&s;h are ioyned into one, and <HI>Tilly</HI> doth no more appeare alive) when the newes of Bohemia did cau&s;e him to make a &s;tand and to take new Coun&s;ell. This we under&s;tand for certaine, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Out of another Letter the <HI>14.</HI> of November.</HEAD>
<P>I Doe not doubt but you have heard that the Count of <HI>Thurne</HI> hath delivered againe both <HI>Prague</HI> and many other parts and places of <HI>Bohemia</HI> from the oppre&s;&s;ion they have &s;ighed under the&s;e many yeres. I hope to &s;end you by the next more particularities thereof.</P>
<P>Meanewhile I will tell you, that a friend of mine writes to me, that Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> fell &s;o &s;icke the ve|ry day of his overthrow before <HI>Leyp&s;ich,</HI> that ever &s;ince all the skill of Surgeons and Phy&s;itions could not keepe him alive. And &s;o I am &s;ure that hee is dead, but I cannot (as yet) tell you when and where he dyed.</P>
<P>The Roman Catholike Army, lying &s;till for the mo&s;t part betwixt the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> doe by incur&s;ions now and then great hurt therea|bout, not again&s;t their Enemies, but onely upon the poore people, burning &s;poiling and &s;acking all whe|ther they can come. For there is no di&s;cipline, nor order, nor Religion among&s;t them. They have late|ly taken &s;ome places (of no &s;trength) in the Marqui|&s;at of <HI>On&s;pach,</HI> and the very towne of <HI>On&s;pach;</HI> yea they are not content to burne and rob the hou&s;es and the poore Countrey-people, but they have of late beene &s;o barbarous that they have opened the Monuments and Sepulchers of the Princes and Mar|qui&s;es
<PB N="13" REF="9">of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> that governed at <HI>On&s;pach,</HI> and there robbed the dead and abu&s;ed the corpes, which &s;ome Finlanders under&s;tanding &s;wore to re|venge, &s;aying; they were but &s;orry to have to deale with &s;uch as dur&s;t &s;hew no courage again&s;t them, but were onely fit to rob and boa&s;t again&s;t the dead Lyons, whom they never dare looke in the faces while&s;t they are alive; And that they being fitter for the gallowes then for an Army, they hoped to meet them once againe as they had lately done in their quarter neare <HI>Leyp&s;ich,</HI> where <HI>Tilly</HI> had cho|&s;en his quarter due to his robbers, and where they receiued their reward.</P>
<P>Landgrave <HI>William</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;en</HI> being come backe a|gaine out of <HI>Paderborn</HI> to <HI>Fulda,</HI> hath brought with him thither many principall and Noble-men of that Bi&s;hoprick, as ho&s;tages, untill all the contributions agreed upon &s;hall be payd.</P>
<P><HI>Bannier</HI> (who is now Generall commanding a Swedi&s;h Army in the Countrey of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI>) hath blocked up the &s;aid Citty, &s;o that it is hoped he will bring the &s;ame againe into the former liber|ty and deliver it from the Cruell V&s;urpators.</P>

<P>This In&s;tant there is a good friend of ours come from <HI>Franckford</HI> po&s;t in 3. dayes, who confirmes the taking of <HI>Hanaw,</HI> and &s;ayth that for certaine, <HI>Prague</HI> is taken, with all the Citties Townes and places thereabouts, by the Duke of <HI>Saxony.</HI> And the King of Swedlands forces are marched from <HI>Hanaw</HI> to <HI>Franckford,</HI> which undoubtedly mu&s;t al&s;o yeeld vn|to him, in fine the King of Swedland is very victo|rious and in all po&s;&s;ibility to conqver all <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Empire: when I have any more newes, I will not faile to perticipate it unto you.</P>
