<HEAD>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING for the mo&s;t part per&s;ued the very &s;ame <HI>Method</HI> in writing this <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> that I u&s;ed in that of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> I &s;hall have little occa&s;ion further to enlarge my &s;elf here, than to acquaint the <HI>Reader</HI> with tho&s;e few <HI>alterations</HI> he will find I have made, which I doubt not he will judg, &s;o advantageous and rea&s;onable, that he will ea&s;ily approve of what I have done, and ex|cu&s;e me of all levity, and un&s;ettledne&s;s of temper.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and cheife&s;t of which <HI>alterations,</HI> he will meet with in the <HI>Map;</HI> where he will find many <HI>Letters,</HI> as well as <HI>figures</HI> &s;et over the <HI>Sheilds,</HI> and the&s;e divided with lines drawn between them; the <HI>figures</HI> on the right hand each <HI>E&s;cocheon,</HI> &s;hewing what <HI>Armes</HI> belong to the <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> as they did in <HI>Oxford&s;hire;</HI> and the <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> on the left hand divi&s;ion, &s;hewing on the contrary what <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> belong to each <HI>Armes:</HI> &s;o that whereas in <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI> upon the &s;ight of a <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> one could ea&s;ily find the <HI>Armes</HI> that be|long'd to it; in this, upon &s;ight of any mans <HI>Armes</HI> (which are ea&s;ily met with, being all placed in <HI>alphabetical</HI> order) one may as quickly find the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> belonging to them; by &s;eeking the &s;ame <HI>Let|ters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> over the <HI>Armes,</HI> in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Northern</HI> Limbs of the <HI>Map,</HI> and finding where they meet in a right angle: the <HI>hou&s;es</HI> (as well as <HI>pari&s;hes</HI> and <HI>villages,</HI> whereof there is an <HI>In|dex</HI> al&s;o annext to this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>) being always within or &s;omewhere at le&s;t touching the <HI>lines</HI> of the <HI>&s;quares,</HI> wherever the&s;e <HI>Ltters</HI> and <HI>figures</HI> meet; that are &s;et over, or after, tho&s;e <HI>Armes,</HI> or <HI>pari&s;hes.</HI> So that the <HI>Reader</HI> hereby tho' never &s;o great a &s;tranger, may not only when he &s;ees a <HI>Gentlemans</HI> &s;eat with <HI>figures</HI> annext, quickly find who&s;e' tis; but (which is of greater u&s;e) if he know but any per&s;ons <HI>name</HI> in the <HI>County,</HI> he &s;hall as quickly find his <HI>Armes,</HI> and whereabout he lives; as he may al&s;o any <HI>Town, Pari&s;h,</HI> or <HI>village,</HI> if he read any thing remarkable in this <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> found or done there, and would know whereabout it is &s;ituate in the <HI>County.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>di&s;tances,</HI> and <HI>Scale</HI> of <HI>Miles</HI> in the <HI>Map,</HI> they were taken after the &s;ame manner as in the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;et off in the <HI>Map</HI> at the rate of two miles in an inch, as may be found upon compari&s;on of a <HI>Rule</HI> with the <HI>Scale,</HI> and of the
<PB REF="4"><HI>Scale</HI> with the <HI>&s;quares,</HI> the mean or middle &s;ort of reputed <HI>Miles</HI> of this <HI>County</HI> (which I have followed here as I did in <HI>Oxford|&s;hire</HI>) containing for the mo&s;t part about <HI>10 furlongs,</HI> of which about <HI>55</HI> an&s;wer a <HI>degree,</HI> &s;o that <HI>92/100</HI> parts of a <HI>mile</HI> or <HI>9/10</HI> and <HI>1/3</HI> make a <HI>minute;</HI> according to which computation the <HI>degrees</HI> of <HI>North Latitude</HI> are divided into <HI>minutes</HI> on each &s;ide the <HI>Map,</HI> be|ing cheifly made off from the Latitude of <HI>Stafford,</HI> which hath been ob&s;erved to be &s;ituat in the <HI>52^d minute</HI> of the <HI>52^d degree, proxime;</HI> the <HI>53^d degree</HI> beginning at the <HI>line</HI> pa&s;&s;ing betwixt <HI>Knighton</HI> and <HI>Radwood</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Map,</HI> and &s;o through <HI>Hanchurch, Trentham, Blurton, Huntley, Bradley,</HI> and <HI>Den&s;ton:</HI> by which di|vi&s;ion't is ea&s;y to know to a <HI>minute</HI> of a <HI>degree,</HI> nay almo&s;t to a <HI>&s;e|cond,</HI> in what latitude every <HI>Town, Pari&s;h, Village,</HI> and <HI>Gentle|mans hou&s;e,</HI> is &s;eated.</P>
<P>Which is all wherein the <HI>Map</HI> differs from the former: and as for the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> it &s;elf, I have &s;o little rea&s;on to repent me of the <HI>Method</HI> I follow'd in that of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> that I hope it differs not from it at all; unle&s;s in ca&s;e of <HI>meliority,</HI> viz. in a greater variety of parallel <HI>Hi&s;tories,</HI> whereby the more unu&s;ual ones, I met with in this <HI>County,</HI> have been all along confirm'd; and in the determination of more dif|ficult <HI>Que&s;tions;</HI> whereby there is &s;carce a <HI>Chapter</HI> in this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> but has been render'd the more con&s;iderable, I mean in the <HI>&s;tating</HI> of &s;ome one, or more of them: which I hope all men will find done with that accuracy, that they will accept of them in excu&s;e of the long delay, that has partly been made upon that account, in the publi&s;hing this <HI>Hi&s;tory;</HI> it having been really &s;o far from a preju|dice, that I think I can &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable man, that this <HI>Hi|&s;tory</HI> could not have po&s;&s;ibly been, what (I hope) it is, in a much le&s;s time.</P>
<P>I know 'twill be objected I publi&s;h't it in print, that this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> &s;hould be ex&s;tant by &s;uch a time preci&s;ely, now long &s;ince pa&s;t; which I here as publicly deny, as ever it 'twas a&s;&s;erted: for the truth whereof I appeal to the very papers &s;ub&s;cribed by the hands of the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> who encouraged the <HI>work,</HI> and if it be found otherwi&s;e then is here profe&s;s't, let me never enjoy the benefit of them; nor of any thing there mention'd, if I doe not litterally and with advantage, make all good I there promi&s;ed: which I hope is as much as will be expected of me, by any judicious unprejudiced per&s;ons, and for others, I am not concern'd to give them &s;atisfaction.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Heavens and Air.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1._HAVING already in the Introduction to my <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Oxford-&s;hire</HI> pre&s;cribed my &s;elf a <HI>Method,</HI> whereof I have no rea&s;on to repent me<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat. Hi&s;t. of Oxford-&s;h.</HI> Chap. 1. &sect;. &sect;. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>, I &s;hall forbear all further <HI>Preface</HI> to this, than to acquaint the <HI>Reader</HI> in &s;hort, that I intend the &s;ame again, not only in the <HI>Whole,</HI> but in the particular <HI>Chapters;</HI> and that I &s;hall make all <HI>Relations</HI> (as formerly) in a plain familiar Stile, without the Ornaments of <HI>Rhetorick,</HI> lea&s;t the matter be ob&s;cured by too much <HI>illu&s;tration;</HI> and with all the imaginable brevity that <HI>per&s;picuity</HI> will bear; it being an indi&s;putable truth, that an <HI>Author</HI> by enlargeing to the utmo&s;t compa&s;s of his <HI>Theme,</HI> &s;ome|times advances his <HI>Papers</HI> to &s;o di&s;proportionable a Bulk, that by writing too much, He had almo&s;t as good have writ nothing, Experience convincing us that <HI>voluminous Works</HI> have but few <HI>Buyers,</HI> and much fewer <HI>Readers.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="12">2. Upon this account too, I have indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et my &s;elf this irrepealable Law, to remain inviolable in all other <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> I &s;hall write of this kind: That whatever I meet with in one <HI>County,</HI> already de&s;cribed in another, &s;hall be only ju&s;t men|tioned as found, &s;een, or heard of, at &s;uch or &s;uch a place, al|ways referring the <HI>Reader</HI> for the De&s;cription, or Philo&s;ophi|cal account of it, to the former <HI>Book;</HI> unle&s;s the thing differ in &s;ome con&s;iderable circum&s;tance, or be but imperfectly de|&s;cribed: thus whatever Curio&s;ity either of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Art</HI> (be it of the greate&s;t moment) that I have met with in <HI>Stafford-&s;hire,</HI> if &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed already in <HI>Oxford-&s;hire,</HI> &s;hall be but barely mention'd here, reference being made to the <HI>Chapter</HI> and <HI>Section</HI> of that <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> where it has been di&s;cour&s;ed on be|fore: Nor need I doubt but the <HI>Stafford-&s;hire Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gen|try</HI> (Learning and Ingenuity being &s;o frequent among&s;t them) will allow me this privilege, without the lea&s;t imputation of detracting from their Country, &s;ince hereby I avoid all vain re|petitions, and yet &s;hall amply repay them again, if I live to write the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of any other <HI>County,</HI> by referring in like man|ner as much or more to theirs; which 'tis manifold odds, but I &s;hall certainly do, if I ever meet hereafter with the like <HI>noble encouragement,</HI> that they have &s;o plentifully and generou&s;ly af|forded me.</P>
<P N="3">3. To come then forthwith to the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> in hand, the <HI>Na|tural Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Stafford;</HI> the fir&s;t thing I met with relating to the <HI>Heavens,</HI> and one of the fir&s;t too that I heard of after I &s;et to work in earne&s;t, was a pretty <HI>rural ob&s;ervation,</HI> of late years made by &s;ome of the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the Town of <HI>Leek</HI> in the <HI>Moorelands,</HI> of the &s;etting of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Summer <HI>Sol|&s;tice,</HI> near a Hill called the <HI>Cloud,</HI> about &s;ix miles di&s;tant, in the confines of <HI>Stafford-&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> which appearing almo&s;t perpendicular on the <HI>Northern</HI> &s;ide, to &s;uch per&s;ons as are &s;tand|ing in <HI>Leek</HI> Church-yard, the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;eems &s;o nicely at that time of year to cut the Edg of it at &s;etting, as in <HI>Tab.</HI> 1. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1. that not|with&s;tanding what is taught by <HI>A&s;tronomers,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> whil&s;t it occupies that <HI>Cardinal</HI> point, appears <HI>Stationary</HI> for &s;ome time without giving any &s;en&s;ible increa&s;e or decrea&s;e to the length of the days; they can plainly perceive by the help of this <HI>Hill,</HI> that no two days are equal, but that there is a &s;en&s;ible difference eve|ry day: ju&s;t as at the Temple of <HI>Tentiris</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> where there are as many Windows as days in the year, &s;o placed, that the <HI>Sun</HI> ri&s;ing in a different degree of the <HI>Zodiac</HI> every day, it al&s;o &s;ends in its beams every day into a di&s;tinct Window from the day before<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>H.

<P><PB N="3" REF="12">For when the <HI>Sun</HI> comes near the <HI>Sol&s;tice,</HI> the whole disk of it at fir&s;t &s;ets behind the <HI>Hill,</HI> after a while the <HI>Northern Limb</HI> fir&s;t appears, and &s;o every night gradually more, till at length the whole <HI>Diameter</HI> comes to &s;et <HI>Northward</HI> of it, for about three nights; but the middle night of the three, very &s;en&s;ibly more re|mote, than the former or the following, when beginning its re|ce&s;s from the <HI>Tropic,</HI> it &s;till continues more and more to be hid|den every night, till at length it de&s;cends quite behind it a|gain.</P>
<P N="4">4.

THe learned, and therefore truly Noble <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> my Lord <HI>Vi&s;count St. Albans,</HI> in his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of Life and Death, or prolongation of Life; as well con&s;idering the <HI>con&s;umption</HI> of the body of Man, as <HI>reparation</HI> of it; the one being as much to be <HI>prevented,</HI> as the other <HI>promoted;</HI> in the for|mer of the&s;e makes the <HI>ambient Air</HI> of eminent concern; &s;ome &s;orts of it being as predatory and wa&s;tful of the body, as others again are comfortable and refre&s;hing: Whence it is that <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of plentiful <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> that have (as we &s;ay) the world at will, and are not tyed to a &s;ingle <HI>Seat;</HI> either build or make choi&s;e of one for their mo&s;t common re&s;idence, that is &s;ituat in a good and whol|&s;ome <HI>Air:</HI> where by <HI>Air</HI> they intend not the <HI>&s;imple Element</HI> of the <HI>Ancients,</HI> for in this &s;en&s;e all <HI>Air</HI> (if there be any &s;uch thing) is equally pure; but that &s;omwhat gro&s;&s;er &s;ub&s;tance that immediat|ly incompa&s;&s;es the <HI>terraqueous Globe,</HI> wherein we daily breath, live, and have our being; which is commonly fill'd with all &s;orts of <HI>Exhalations,</HI> and is comparatively good or bad, healthy or other|wi&s;e; as it partakes more or le&s;s, of whol&s;ome or noxious, <HI>vapors</HI> or <HI>fumes;</HI> exhaled either from quick liveing &s;treams, or &s;tagnant pooles and uliginous boggs; from dry whol&s;ome Soils, or mineral Earths. Which &s;eeming indeed the more immediat cau&s;es of <HI>&s;ickne&s;s</HI> or <HI>health</HI> than the pure <HI>Air,</HI> that being only the vehicle of di&s;ea&s;es, and not fundamentally good or bad, but by partici|pation, as was hinted in <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nat.

<P N="2">2. But that the <HI>Reader</HI> may not only be amu&s;ed with <HI>generalls,</HI> let us treat of this matter more <HI>di&s;tinctly</HI> than u&s;ual, and &s;trictly examin whether this <HI>Air</HI> we breath in, do indeed &s;o much affect the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> as is commonly pretended; and if &s;o, which it is that comforteth and con&s;erveth it mo&s;t, and which mo&s;t preyeth upon it, &s;o as to ha&s;ten its con&s;umption; that certainly being to be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t <HI>healthy,</HI> that prolongeth; and that the mo&s;t <HI>unhealthy,</HI> that abridgeth its duration: Wherein I &s;hall not need to trouble the <HI>Reader</HI> with any of the nice <HI>Experiments</HI> of the <HI>Air-Pump,</HI> whereof &s;ome not unfitly might have been reduced to this
<PB N="33" REF="30">&s;ubject; nor with a profound explication of the <HI>flammula Cordis,</HI> or what ever el&s;e it is that continually gives <HI>accen&s;ion</HI> to our <HI>blood,</HI> and is cheri&s;h't by the gentle refocillations of the <HI>Air:</HI> It being &s;uf|ficient for my purpo&s;e, and evident even to <HI>rural Ob&s;ervators;</HI> fir&s;t that the <HI>Air,</HI> impregnated with <HI>vapors</HI> and <HI>fumes</HI> (&s;uch as is the <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> wherein we breath) doth &s;en&s;ibly affect the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>Man;</HI> witne&s;s the common <HI>fumigations</HI> made in <HI>hy&s;terical di&s;ea&s;es</HI> to recall the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the too too common <HI>Experiment</HI> of <HI>Drun|kenne&s;s;</HI> with which no que&s;tion its more inartificial operations bear &s;ome proportion, though they are not &s;o &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P N="3">3. It being plain then that the <HI>Air</HI> as it may be variou&s;ly quali|fyed does affect the <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>humors,</HI> and con&s;equently the whole <HI>Cra&s;is</HI> of the body: it remains &s;econdly that we &s;hew which <HI>Airs</HI> they be, that mo&s;t refre&s;h and pre&s;erve it; and on the contrary which prey upon it, &s;o as either to con&s;ume it gradually, or de&s;troy it on a &s;udden: for the clearer di&s;qui&s;ition of which matter I mu&s;t premi&s;e &s;ome <HI>po&s;tulata,</HI> which I need not to doubt (I think) but will be ea&s;ily granted, &s;ince they are &s;uch only as are univer&s;ally agreed on: As fir&s;t that the <HI>blood</HI> principally, and o|ther <HI>humors;</HI> are the <HI>&s;ubjectum in quo,</HI> or vehicle of the <HI>&s;pirits</HI> by which the <HI>Animal operations</HI> of the <HI>body</HI> are performed; and 2. that the more the <HI>&s;pirits, flammula,</HI> or <HI>heat</HI> do prey upon the <HI>hu|mors,</HI> or the <HI>humors</HI> oppre&s;s the <HI>&s;pirits,</HI> &s;o much the &s;horter is the continuance of that <HI>body;</HI> and that therefore 3. in order to a la&s;t|ing duration, the <HI>&s;pirits</HI> ought to be kept in &s;uch a moderate tem|per, that (as the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> well ob&s;erves<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of Life and Death, Intent. <HI>1.</HI> Operat. <HI>1.

<P N="4">4.

</LIST> All which, whether <HI>&s;uper</HI> or <HI>&s;ubterraneal,</HI> I take in general to pro|ceed from &s;tagnations in the &s;ubterranel Vaults of the Earth, for want of due Ventilations, and commerce betweene the <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Air. The <HI>material</HI> cau&s;es 'tis true may be various, either &s;imple or compound: as the meer corruption of the &s;imple Air alone upon a long &s;tagnation in the Coal-rooms, and the rifts and clefts of the rock of coal it &s;elf, may be its <HI>material</HI> cau&s;e indeed, but the <HI>cau&s;a &s;ine qua non</HI> of &s;uch a damp, I take to be the want of mo|tion in tho&s;e cavities, without which, the <HI>Air</HI> would never have corrupted; no more than <HI>water</HI> which never corrupts till it &s;tag|nates,
<PB N="134" REF="92">when indeed like the <HI>Air</HI> it becomes poy&s;onous, though po&s;&s;ib|ly not to that degree, the <HI>Air</HI> being a body much finer, and convey|ed to the more tender parts of the body.</P>
<P N="43">43. Whence it is that in the old <HI>works,</HI> wherein there has been no digging for a long time, no laveing, drawing, or pumping of water, all which keep the <HI>Air</HI> in motion, and the <HI>water</HI> from canckering, the&s;e <HI>damps</HI> are mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t dangerous. Whence it is too that the <HI>Works</HI> where the bed of coal is thin, and admits of but few or no &s;uch rifts or clefts for the <HI>Air</HI> to &s;tagnat or corrupt in, are &s;eldom or never troubled with them. Upon which account 'tis likewi&s;e that though a bed of coal have many of the&s;e rifts, and large ones too; yet as long as there is a profluence of <HI>water</HI> through them, there is no danger of their entertaining &s;uch <HI>damps;</HI> which as &s;oon as made dry by a <HI>Sough</HI> or <HI>free-Level,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Mine</HI> &s;hall become much more lyable to them; the whol&s;om <HI>Air</HI> that was in them whil&s;t kept in motion by the <HI>flux</HI> of the <HI>water</HI> (having little or no communication with that above ground) now &s;tagnating and corrupting to that degree, that it not only extingui&s;hes the glowing heat of coales, and the flame of candles, torches &amp;c. but the <HI>flam|mula vitae</HI> too in mo&s;t living creatures, &s;o that the <HI>Animal</HI> which re&s;pires it, &s;ome times expires with it too. And as it is in <HI>&s;imple damps</HI> made out of corrupted <HI>Air</HI> only, &s;o it is in the compound ones of one or more <HI>minerals,</HI> whether vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible; whether ari&s;eing from the <HI>&s;moak</HI> of <HI>coale</HI> it &s;elfe, or as &s;ome will have one of them, from the <HI>&s;cent</HI> of <HI>vegetables,</HI> or 2 from the &s;teams of the <HI>Work|mens</HI> breath, and &s;weat of their bodies, together with the &s;moak of the candles they work by; or 3 from &s;ulphureous, ar&s;enical, ni|trous, or other &s;uch <HI>mineral</HI> &s;teams that may be incident to <HI>Coal|works:</HI> for to all the&s;e they a&s;cribe a particular &s;ort of <HI>Damp.</HI></P>

<P N="48">48. There is another &s;ort of <HI>damp</HI> they call <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Air.</HI> i. e. want of Air &s;ufficient for the breathing of <HI>Animals,</HI> and burning of <HI>Can|dles.</HI> This &s;ort of <HI>damp</HI> (improperly &s;o call'd) is that they commonly meet with in long <HI>Soughs</HI> for conveyance of water from the coale; or when to avoid charge they run in their work as far underground as po&s;&s;ible, for wining of coal, without leting down a new &s;haft. The cau&s;e of which &s;ort of <HI>damp</HI> is cetainly nothing el&s;e, but the want of communication with the <HI>Air</HI> above ground, it being found by experience that the further a Man goes, into one of the&s;e <HI>coal-levels,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="94">the flame of his candle will gradually grow le&s;s and le&s;s, till it goes quite out, and his difficulty of breathing greater and greater, till he cannot breathe at all, <HI>&amp; vice ver&s;a</HI> in his return.

This &s;ort of <HI>damp</HI> is nothing &s;o dangerous as &s;ome of the former, becau&s;e not &s;urpri&s;ing, but comeing &s;o gra|dually, that a man may releive Him&s;elf at plea&s;ure, though it be true enough too, that this will kill <HI>Animals,</HI> as well as extingui&s;h <HI>coales</HI> or <HI>candles,</HI> if they be far enough removed from the <HI>Air</HI> above ground, and continue long enough there.</P>

<P N="25">25. Whereof, tho&s;e they intend to be cut into <HI>rodds,</HI> are car|ryed to the <HI>&s;litting Mills,</HI> where they fir&s;t break or cut them cold with the force of one of the <HI>Wheels</HI> into &s;hort lengths; then they are put into a <HI>furnace</HI> to be heated red hot to a good height, and then brought &s;ingly to the <HI>Rollers,</HI> by which they are drawn even, and to a greater length: after this another <HI>Workman</HI> takes them whil&s;t hot and puts them through the <HI>Cutters,</HI> which are of divers &s;izes, and may be put on and off, according to plea&s;ure: then another lays them &s;traight al&s;o whil&s;t hot, and when cold binds them into <HI>faggots,</HI> and then they are fitting for &s;ale. And thus I have given an account of the <HI>Iron works</HI> of <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> from the <HI>Ore</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="109">to the <HI>&s;litting Mills,</HI> as they are now exerci&s;ed in their perfection; the improvement whereof we &s;hall find very great, if we look back upon the <HI>Methods</HI> of our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> who made <HI>Iron</HI> in <HI>foot bla&s;ts</HI> or <HI>bloomeries,</HI> by Mens treading the bellows, by which way they could make but one little lump or <HI>bloom</HI> of <HI>Iron</HI> in a day, not 100 weight; leaving as much <HI>Iron</HI> in the <HI>Slag</HI> as they got out. Whereas now they will make two or three <HI>tuns</HI> of <HI>ca&s;t Iron</HI> in 24 hours: leaving the <HI>Slag</HI> &s;o poore, that the <HI>Founders</HI> can|not melt them again to profit. Not to mention again the va&s;t ad|vantage they have from the new Invention of <HI>&s;litting Mills,</HI> for cutting their <HI>barrs</HI> into <HI>rodds,</HI> above what they had an|ciently.</P>
<P N="26">26. Thus I &s;ay the <HI>Iron-works</HI> are exerci&s;ed in their <HI>perfection,</HI> and all their prncipal <HI>Iron</HI> undergoes all the foremention'd preparations; not but that for &s;everal purpo&s;es, as for the <HI>backs</HI> of <HI>Chimneys, Garden-rolls,</HI> and &s;uch like; they u&s;e a &s;ort of <HI>ca&s;t-Iron</HI> which they take out of the <HI>Receivers</HI> of the <HI>Furnaces,</HI> as &s;oon as it is melted, in great <HI>Ladles,</HI> and pour it into <HI>moulds</HI> of fine &s;and, in like manner as they ca&s;t the other &s;ofter <HI>Metalls.</HI> Thus the in|genious <HI>Will. Chetwynd</HI> of <HI>Rugeley</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at <HI>Madeley</HI> furnace, ca&s;t <HI>Iron-Rolls</HI> for gardens, hollow like the <HI>Mills</HI> for <HI>Sugar Canes,</HI> of 5, 6, 7 or 800 weight a piece; the hollows whereof being fill'd with timber, and wedg'd up clo&s;e, the other <HI>Iron-work</HI> of the <HI>Roll,</HI> is fa&s;tned to the wood in the &s;ame place as in other <HI>rolls,</HI> which are weightyer and more &s;ub&s;tantial than any other rolls I have el&s;where &s;een. For &s;uch purpo&s;es as the&s;e, this &s;erves well enough, but for others it will not, for it is &s;o brittle, that being heated, with one blow of a hammer it will break all to pieces.</P>
<P N="27">27.

By <HI>Nipping</HI> the <HI>Budds</HI> before they come to <HI>Flower,</HI> and &s;o put|ting them &s;o far back, that they cannot recover this <HI>injury</HI> &s;o as to produce their <HI>Fruit</HI> before the &s;ea&s;on above mention'd. Or el&s;e 2.

<P>How unwillingly the cold vi&s;cid juices part with the &s;en&s;itive &s;oule, appear'd, I &s;ay, mo&s;t &s;trangely in this ca&s;e: unle&s;s we &s;hall rather &s;ay &s;he could not be hanged, upon account that the <HI>Larynx</HI> or upper part of her <HI>Wind-pipe</HI> was turned to <HI>bone,</HI> as <HI>Fal|lopius</HI> tells us he has &s;ometimes found it<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Gab.

<P N="48">48. Thus having done with the <HI>Women</HI> &s;olitarily con&s;idered, I &s;hall next treat of the <HI>Men</HI> and the accidents that have attend|ed them during the cour&s;e of their lives in the like manner. And fir&s;t of the extraordinary <HI>perfections</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> whether of body or
<PB N="293" REF="197">mind, and then of their <HI>defects.</HI> As for the <HI>perfections</HI> of the <HI>body,</HI> I take that of <HI>&s;trength</HI> to be one of the cheife&s;t; wherein I met with &s;ome that excell'd &s;o much, that unle&s;s I had &s;een the things done my &s;elf, I &s;hould have though them incredible: par|ticularly that of one <HI>Godfrey Witrings</HI> a butcher of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> whome I &s;aw take a forme, at <HI>Robert Launders</HI> in the Lane, 6 foot 10 inches long, and 56 pounds weight, by one end in his <HI>teeth</HI> (holding his hands behind him, and bearing the leggs of that end next him again&s;t his bre&s;t) and lift the other end the whole height of the parlour, &s;triking it 3 times again&s;t the boards of the room above. Now &s;uppo&s;eing the leggs to &s;tand about 10 inches from the end of the <HI>form,</HI> towards the middle, or <HI>center</HI> of <HI>gravi|ty,</HI> which is near of the di&s;tance betwixt the end and the <HI>Center;</HI> by computation he lifted thus with his <HI>teeth</HI> about 168 pounds weight. Which is not &s;o much as what was done by a Juglar <HI>Car|dan</HI> tells us of, who took up the <HI>ma&s;t</HI> of a &s;mall boat with his <HI>teeth,</HI> and threw it fir&s;t upon one &s;houlder, whence he removed it to the other, without touching it with his hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hieron.

<P N="49">49. Nor &s;o much as was performed by one <HI>Nicholas Cooper</HI> of <HI>Acton-Tru&s;&s;el,</HI> who was al&s;o a man of &s;o extraordinary &s;trength in tho&s;e parts, that he could lift a &s;ack of <HI>wheat</HI> of 4 &s;trike with his <HI>teeth;</HI> which accounting but 50 pounds to the <HI>&s;trike</HI> (than which &s;earce any weighs le&s;s) amounts to 200 pounds weight, but reckoning at 60 pounds <HI>per bu&s;hell</HI> (as &s;ome <HI>wheat</HI> weighs) he lifted 240. But this was not the utmo&s;t he could doe neither, for once upon a <HI>wager,</HI> he took up a man, by a coard tyed round him, of 300 weight, and &s;et him on a <HI>Table.</HI> Nor was he &s;trong in his <HI>teeth</HI> only but in the whole frame of his body, having taken up at a time 3 &s;izeable men, one under each <HI>Arm,</HI> and a third in his <HI>teeth.</HI> Which is not much le&s;s than that mention'd by <HI>Cardan,</HI> who &s;aw a man dance with two under his armes, as many upon his &s;houlders, and one hanging about his neck<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE>. And formerly being de&s;ired to give a <HI>&s;pecimen</HI> of his &s;trength, he &s;et his back under the <HI>Axle-tree</HI> of a <HI>Cart</HI> laden with 3 hor&s;load and &frac12; of <HI>coals,</HI> and not only lifted it <HI>wheels</HI> and all, but turned it quite round. The &s;ame per&s;on having a <HI>Le&s;ow</HI> quite overrun with well grown <HI>broom,</HI> near a mans height; whereas others are forced to &s;tock or root up &s;uch broom with <HI>Matocks</HI> and other <HI>in&s;tru|ments;</HI> he pluck't up all <HI>his</HI> by the <HI>roots</HI> with his hands, though the ground was 4 <HI>Acres.</HI> To whom let me add that one <HI>Thomas Wall</HI> of <HI>Wolver hampton</HI> was once &s;o &s;trong in his <HI>teeth,</HI> that he could readily bend a large <HI>nail</HI> or <HI>tenterbook,</HI> and &s;et it &s;traight
<PB N="294" REF="198">again with them: for the better performance whereof I was told his <HI>teeth</HI> were <HI>molares</HI> before, in&s;tead of <HI>inci&s;ores;</HI> but upon exa|mination I found them not &s;o, only indeed his <HI>inci&s;ores</HI> were of an unu&s;ual thickne&s;s.</P>
<P N="50">50. Not at all inferior to any of the&s;e in matters of <HI>&s;trength,</HI> was one <HI>Walter Par&s;ons</HI> of <HI>We&s;t-Bromwich</HI> in this <HI>County,</HI> though <HI>his</HI> was not &s;o much to be admired as <HI>theirs,</HI> who were Men but of a middleing ordinary &s;ize, whereas <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> had a &s;tature pro|portionable to his &s;trength; being &s;o very tall when he was a young <HI>apprentice,</HI> that they were forced to digg a hole in the ground for him to &s;tand in up to his knees, when he &s;truck at the <HI>Anvil</HI> (for he was fir&s;t a <HI>Black-Smith</HI>) or &s;awed wood with ano|ther, that he might be at a <HI>Level</HI> with his <HI>fellow-workman.</HI> At length he became <HI>Porter</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, where he behaved him&s;elf &s;o generou&s;ly, that though he had valour equal to his &s;trength, yet he &s;corned to take advantage to injure any per&s;on by it; upon which account we have but few <HI>experiments</HI> left us of his great <HI>&s;trength,</HI> but &s;uch as were &s;portive: as that being af|fronted by a man of ordinary &s;tature, as he walkt <HI>London</HI> &s;treets, he only took him up by the wa&s;tband of his breeches, and hung him upon one of the hooks in the <HI>&s;hambles,</HI> to be ridicul'd by the people, and &s;o went his way: and that &s;ometimes by way of merryment, he would take two of the talle&s;t <HI>Yeomen</HI> of the <HI>Guard</HI> (like the <HI>Gizard</HI> and <HI>Liver</HI>) under his <HI>Arms,</HI> and carry them as he plea&s;ed (in &s;pight of all re&s;i&s;tance) about the <HI>Guard Chamber:</HI> where (if I am not mi&s;informed) <HI>that</HI> is his <HI>picture</HI> which hangs at the end next the &s;tairs, leading down into the Court toward <HI>White-Hall</HI> Gate.</P>
<P N="51">51. There is another <HI>picture</HI> of him, as I have been told al&s;o by &s;ome, in the great room at the <HI>Popes-head</HI> Tavern, in <HI>Popes-head</HI> Alley: but whether they are the true <HI>pictures</HI> of him or noe, it being uncertain that they were drawn in the ju&s;t proportion, I took not the pains to have them mea&s;ur'd; chu&s;ing rather to col|lect what his height might be, from a true mea&s;ure of his hand yet remaining upon a piece of Wain&s;cot at <HI>Bentley-Hall:</HI> by which it appeare that from the <HI>Carpus</HI> to the end of the <HI>middle finger,</HI> it was eleven inches long, and the <HI>palm</HI> 6 inches broad: which (abate|ments being made interchangeably) is much about the &s;ize of the hand of <HI>Edmund Malloon</HI> a youth of 19 years old, born at <HI>Port-Leicester</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for his extraordinary &s;tature &s;hewn publickly here in <HI>Oxford</HI> in 1684, which though from the <HI>Carpus</HI> to the end of the <HI>middle finger</HI> it were 12 inches long, yet the <HI>palm</HI> was no more than five inches broad. i. e. it &s;ell as much &s;hort of <HI>Par|&s;ons</HI>'s hand in the bredth, as it exceeded it in length.</P>

<P N="56">56. And this is all worthy notice relating to the di&s;tribution of the <HI>golden numbers, Emboli&s;mal months,</HI> &amp;c. but that there is a peculiar reguard in ordering the&s;e matters to be had in plac|ing the <HI>golden numbers</HI> from the 8 of <HI>March.</HI> to the 5 of <HI>Apr.</HI> within which compa&s;s none of the <HI>Lunations</HI> mu&s;t exceed 29 days, becau&s;e no <HI>Pa&s;chal Lunation</HI> may con&s;i&s;t of more; whence it is that from the 8 of <HI>March</HI> to the 6 of <HI>Apr.</HI> (to both which days the <HI>golden number</HI> 16 is prefixt) there are but 29 days; and from the 9^t^h. of <HI>March</HI> to the 7. of <HI>April.</HI> (to both which days the <HI>golden number</HI> is 5) are al&s;o but 29 days; and &s;o of the re&s;t, till you come to the <HI>fift</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> all the <HI>Pa&s;chal Luna|tions</HI> and <HI>golden numbers</HI> falling out, and being expre&s;s't, be|tween tho&s;e two days. Nor mu&s;t it be forgot that the 7^t^h and la&s;t <HI>Emboli&s;mal month,</HI> which never can con&s;i&s;t of above 29 days (19 times 11 being but 209, whereas 210 are requi&s;ite for 7 times 30) is <HI>intercalated</HI> notwith&s;tanding as a month of 30, from <HI>Mar.</HI> the 5 to <HI>Apr.</HI> 4. where are two months together of 30 days, in the <HI>year</HI> when the <HI>golden number</HI> is 19, as well as in any of the re&s;t, which could not be unle&s;s the <HI>intercalation</HI> were there: in compen&s;ation whereof the <HI>Moone</HI> for <HI>July,</HI> which &s;hould have been of 30 days, they make this year but of 29, counting from <HI>July</HI> 1. to <HI>July</HI> 30; the <HI>golden number</HI> 19 being put to <HI>July</HI> the 30, which &s;hould have been &s;et before the 31: &s;o that here are 3 months together of 29 days, the <HI>trice&s;ima Luna,</HI> that &s;hould have been in <HI>July,</HI> being &s;kipt over, which they call <HI>Saltus Lunae;</HI> which twas ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;t be &s;omewhere, by rea&s;on the <HI>intercalatory months</HI> were all of 30 days.</P>
<P N="57"><PB N="428" REF="282">57. Thus having &s;hewn the rea&s;on of the di&s;tribution of the <HI>golden number</HI> in general, it remains that I give a more parti|cular account how it comes to pa&s;s, that the <HI>following golden number</HI> &s;hould be made by adding 8 to the <HI>preceding;</HI> and the <HI>preceding</HI> by adding, 11 to the <HI>following:</HI> for the fir&s;t whereof, I take the rea&s;on to be, that in 8 <HI>Solar</HI> years, allowing to each 365 days and 6 h. which are 2922 days, there happen to be 99 <HI>Lunations</HI> wanting one day, 12 h. 41&prime;. 15&Prime; 9&tprime;; upon which account after 8 years the <HI>Lunations</HI> doe not begin upon the &s;ame day they did 8 years before, but one day and &frac12; later, <HI>proxime;</HI> wherefore after every <HI>golden number</HI> through the whole <HI>Calendar,</HI> another is written next it which exceeds it by <HI>eight,</HI> to &s;hew that after 8 years the <HI>New Moons</HI> will not fall upon tho&s;e days, upon which the <HI>antecedent golden numbers</HI> are writ|ten, but upon tho&s;e to which the <HI>numbers</HI> are prefix't, that are made off them by <HI>eight.</HI> And becau&s;e in twice 8 years, the twice 12 hours and odd minutes make another <HI>day</HI> and better, therefore the <HI>golden numbers</HI> are not always immediatly put after each other upon all days of the months, but every <HI>third</HI> day, for the mo&s;t part, is left vacant for the&s;e twice 12 hours; &s;o that every two <HI>golden numbers</HI> have ordinarily 3 days allowed them, otherwi&s;e the <HI>Lunations</HI> in each 16 years time, would be always anticipated one day at le&s;t.</P>
<P N="58">58. And the rea&s;on why every <HI>preceding golden number</HI> is formed of the <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> by adding 11 is, becau&s;e in 11 <HI>Solar</HI> years, in which are 417 days, there are 136 <HI>Lunations</HI> and one day, 14 h. 8&prime;. 47&Prime;. 4&tprime;. for that in 136 <HI>Lunations</HI> there are re|quired only 4016 days 3 h. 51&prime;. 12&Prime;. 56&tprime;. and therefore the <HI>New Moones</HI> after 11 years, fall not on the &s;ame days they did the &s;aid 11 years before, but one day and almo&s;t half another &s;oo|ner: upon which account before every <HI>golden number,</HI> is &s;et a|nother <HI>golden number</HI> that exceeds it by 11, to &s;hew that after 11 years, the <HI>New Moons</HI> will not fall upon tho&s;e days they did 11 years before, but &s;ooner, <HI>viz.</HI> upon tho&s;e to which the <HI>num|bers</HI> are prefixt, that are made off them by the addition of 11.
