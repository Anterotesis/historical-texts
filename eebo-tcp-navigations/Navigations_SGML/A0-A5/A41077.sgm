<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS I live Gentlemen, I am a|maz'd how any Piece could be made such minc't meat as this hath been by a twice-printed Co|py, which I find flying abroad to a|buse the <HI>Author,</HI> who long since tra|velling for Companies-sake, with a Friend into the Low-Countreys, would needs for his own Recreation, write this Essay of them, as he then found them: I am sure as far from ever thinking to have it publick, as he was from any private spleen to the Nation, or any person in it; for I have moved him often to Print it, but could never get his consent, his modesty ever esteeming it among his <HI>Puerilia,</HI> and (as he said) a piece
<PB REF="3">
too light for a Prudential man to publish: th truth is, it was meerly occasional in his youth, and the time so little, that he had for observation (his stay there not being above three weeks) that it could not well be ex|pected, he should say more, and though the former part be joculary and spor|tive, yet the seriousness of the latter part renders the Character no way injurious to the people. And now find|ing some ruffled Feathers only pre|sented for the whole Bird, and having a perfect Copy by me, I have presu|med to trespass so much upon the <HI>Au|thor</HI> as to give it you (in vindication of him) so as I am confilent it was dressed by his own Pen. And after I have begged his Pardon for exposing it without his Warrant, I shall leave you to judg by comparing this and the former Impressions, whether or no he hath not been abused sufficiently.</P>

<P>THey are a general Sea-Land. The great Bog of <HI>Europe.</HI> There is not such another Marsh in the world that's flat. They are an universal Quag-mire Epito|miz'd. <HI>A Green Cheese in pickle.</HI> There is in them an <HI>AEquilibrium</HI> of mud and water. A strong Earth|quake would shake them to a <HI>Chaos,</HI> from which the successive force of the Sun, rather then Creation, hath a little emended them. They are the Ingredients of a black Pudding,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
and want only stirring together. Marry 'tis best making on't in a dry Summer, else you will have more blood then grist; and then have you no way to make it serve for a|ny thing, but to tread it under <HI>Zo|na Torrida,</HI> and so dry it for Turfs.</P>
<P>Sayes one, it affords the people one commodity beyond all the o|ther Regions; if they die in per|dition, they are so low, that they have a shorter cut to Hell then the rest of their Neighbours. And for this cause, perhaps all strange Religions throng thither, as natu|rally inclining towards their (en|ter. Besides, their Riches shews them to be <HI>Pluto's</HI> Region, and you all know what part that was which the Poets did of old assign him. Here is <HI>Seyx, Acheron, Cecytus,</HI> and the rest of those muddy streams
<PB N="3" REF="4">
that have made matter for the Fa|blers. Almost every one is a <HI>Charon</HI> here, and if you have but a <HI>Naulum</HI> to give, you cannot want or Boat or Pilot. To confirm all, let but some of our Separatists be asked, and they shall swear that the <HI>Elizian Fields</HI> are there.</P>
<P>It is an excellent Countrey for a despairing Lover: for every cor|ner affords him Willow to make a Garland on; but if Justice doom him to be hang'd on any other Tree, he may in spight of the sen|tence live long and confident. If he had rather quench his spirits than suffocate them, so rather chuse to feed Lob<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters">ers then Crows; 'tis but leaping from his window, and he lights in a River or Sea; for most of their dwellings stand like Privies in moted-houses, hanging still over the water. If none of
<PB N="4" REF="5">
these cure him, keep him but a Winter in a house without a Stove, and that shall cool him.</P>
<P>The oile is all fat, though want|ing the colour to shew it so; for indeed it is the buttock of the World, full of veins and blood, but no bones in't. Had <HI>St. Steven</HI> been condemn'd to suffer here, he might have been alive at this day; for un|less it be in their paved Cities, gold is a great deal more plentiful then stones, except it be living ones; and then for their heaviness you may take in almost all the Na|tion.</P>
<P>'Tis a singular place to fat Mon|keys in. There are Spiders as big as Shrimps, and I think as many. Their Gardens being moist, abound with these. No creatures; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> sure they were bred, not made. Were they but as venemous as rank, to
<PB N="5" REF="5">
gather herbs were to hazard Mar|tyrdom. They are so large, that you would almost believe the <HI>Hes|perides</HI> were here, and these the <HI>Dragons</HI> that did guard them.</P>
<P>You may travel the Countrey though you have not a guide: for you cannot baulk your road with|out the hazard of drowning. There is not there any use of an Harbin|ger. Wheresoever men go the way is made before them. Had they Cities large as their walls, <HI>Rome</HI> would be esteemed a bable. 20 miles in length is nothing for a Waggon to be hurried on one of them, where if your fore-man be sober, you may travel in safety, otherwise you must have stronger faith then <HI>Peter</HI> had, else you sink immediate|ly. A starting horse endangers you to two deathe at once, breaking of your neck, and drowning.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
If your way be not thus, it hangs in the water, and at the approach of your Waggon shall shake as if it were Ague strucken. <HI>Duke d' Al|va's</HI> taxing of the tenth penny frighted it into a <HI>Palsey,</HI> which all the <HI>Mountebancks</HI> they have bred since could never tell how to cure.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed but a bridge of swim|ming earth, or a flag somewhat thicker then ordinary, if the strings crack your course is shortned, you can neither hope for Heaven nor fear Hell, you shall be sure to stick fast between them. Marry if your Faith flow Purgatory height, you may pray if you will for that to clense you from the Mud shall soil you.</P>
<P>'Tis a green sod in water, where if the <HI>German Eagle</HI> dares to bath himself, he's glad again to pearch that he may dry his wings.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
Some things they do that seem Wonders. 'Tis ordinary to see them fish for fire in water, which they catch in Nets and transport to land in their boats, where they spread it more smoothly then a <HI>Mercer</HI> doth his <HI>Velvet</HI> when he would hook in an heir upon his coming to age. Thus lying in a field, you would think you saw a Cantle of green Cheese spread o|ver with black butter.</P>
<P>If <HI>AEtna</HI> be Hells mouth or fore|gate, sure here's found the <HI>Postern.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Port-Esquiline</HI> of the world, where the whole earth doth vent her crude blackgore, which the Inhabitants scrape away for fuel, as men with spoon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 word"> excre|ments-from <HI>Civit-Cats.</HI></P>
<P>Their ordinary Pack-horses are all of wood, carry their bridles in their tails, and their burdens
<PB N="8" REF="7">
in their bellies. A strong Tide and a stiff Gale are the spurs that make them speedy. When they travel they touch no ground, and when they stand still they ride; and are never in danger but when they drink up too much of their way.</P>
<P>There is a Province among them, where every woman carries a Cony in a <HI>Lambskin.</HI> 'Tis a cu|stom, and not one that travels e|ver leaves it behind her. Now guess if you can what beast that is, which is clad in a fur both of hair and wool.</P>
<P>They dress their meat <HI>in Aqua Coelesti,</HI> for it springs not as ours from the earth, but comes to them as <HI>Mann<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> falling from Heaven. This they keep un|der ground till it stinks, and then they pump it out again for use. So when you wash your hands with
<PB N="9" REF="7">
one hand, you had need hold your nose with the other; for though it be not Cordial, 'tis certainly a strong water</P>
<P>The Elem<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">nts are here at vari|ance, the subtile overswaying the grosser. The fire consumes the earth, and the air the water. They burn Turffs, and drain their grounds with Wind-mills: As if the Cholick were a remedy for the Stone; and they would prove a|gainst Philosophy the Worlds Con|flagration to be natural, even shewing thereby that the very Ele|ment of earth is combustible.</P>
<P>The Land that they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 words"> keep as neatly as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span"> his Beard. They ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span"> Mowing. 'Tis so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span"> water and Rivers, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span">t it is impos|sible to make a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span">ommon among them. Even the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span">ists</HI> are here
<PB N="10" REF="8">
at a stand, only they hold their pride in wrangling for that which they never will find. Our Justices would be much at ease although our <HI>English</HI> Poor were still among them: For whatsoever they do, they can break no hedges. Sure had the wise men of <HI>Gotham</HI> lived here, they would have studied some other death for their <HI>Cuckow.</HI></P>
<P>Their Ditches they frame as they list, and distinguish them in|to nooks, as my Lord Majors Cook doth his Custards. Clense them they do often: but 'tis as Physicians <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters">ve their potions, more to catch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 words">  then cast the Mud out.</P>

A gallant masquing suit sits not more compleat, then a coat of thatch though many years wearing.</P>
<P>If it stand dry 'tis embraced by <HI>Vines,</HI> as if it were against the na|ture of a <HI>Dutch man</HI> not to have <HI>Bacchus</HI> his neighbour. If you find it lower-seated, 'tis only a close Arbor in a plump of <HI>Willows</HI> and <HI>Alders,</HI> pleasant enough while the dog-days last; but those past once, you must practice wading, or be prisoner till the next Spring. Only a hard frost with the help of a Sledge, may release you.</P>
<P>The Bridg to this is an out landish Planck with a box of stones to poiz it withal, which with the least help turns round like the ex|ecutioner when he whips off a head. That when the Master is over<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">ands drawn, and then he<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span">in his Castle.</P>
<P>'Tis sure his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span">hat renders

him suspicious. That he may there|fore certainly see who enters, you shall ever find his window made over his door. But it may be, that is to shew you his Pedigree, for though his Ancestors were never known, their Arms are there; which (in spight of Heraldry) shall bear their Atchievment with a Helmet for a Baron at least Marry the Field perhaps shall be charged with three baskets, to shew what trade his father was.</P>
<P>Escutcheons are as plentiful as Gentry is scarce. Every man there is his own Herald; and he that has but wit enough to invent a Coat, may challenge it as his own.</P>
<P>When you are entred the house, the first thing you encounter is a Looking gla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters"> No question but a true Emb<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span"> politick hospi|tality;
<PB N="13" REF="9">
for though it reflect your self in your own figure 'tis yet no longer then while you are there before it. When you are gone once it flatters the next comer, without the least remembrance that you e're were there.</P>
<P>The next are the vessels of the house marshalled about the room like Watchmen. All as neat as if you werein a Citizens Wives Ca|binet; for unless it be themselves, they let none of Gods creatures lose any thing of their native beauty.</P>
<P>Their houses, especially in their Cities, are the best eye-beauties of their Countrey. For cost and sight they far exceed our <HI>English,</HI> but they want their magnificence. Their lining is yet more rich then their outside, not in hangings but pi|ctures, which ev<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 span">he poorest are
<PB N="14" REF="10">
there furnisht with. Not a Cobler but has his toys for ornament. Were the knacks of all their houses set together, there would not be such another <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Their Artists for these are as rare as thought, for they can paint you a fat hen in her feathers; and if you want the language, you may learn a great deal of Dutch by their signs; for what they are, they ever write under them. So by this device hang up more honesty then they keep.</P>
<P>Coaches are as rare as Comets; and those that live loosely need not fear one punishment which often vexes such with us: They may be sure, though they be discovered, they shall not be carted.</P>
<P>All their Merchandise they draw through the streets on Sledges;
<PB N="15" REF="10">
or as we on Hurdles do traitors to execution.</P>
<P>Their rooms are but several land-boxes: if so, you must either go out to spit, or blush when you see the Map brought.</P>
<P>Their beds are no other then land-cabins, high enough to need a ladder or stairs. Up once, you are walled in with Wainscot, and that is good discretion to avoid the trouble of making your will every night; for once falling out else would break your neck perfectly. But if you die in it, this comfort you shall leave your friends, that you di'd in clean linnen.</P>
<P>Whatsoever their estates be, their houses must be fair. There|fore from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> they have banisht Sea-cole, lest it soil their buildings, of which the statelier sort are somtimes sententious, and
<PB N="16" REF="11">
in the front carry some conceit of the Owner, As to give you a taste in these.</P>
<L><HI>Christus Adjutor meus;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hoc abdicato Perenne Quero;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hic Medio tuitus Itur.</HI></L>
<P>Every door seems studded with Diamonds. The nails and hinges hold a constant brightness, as if rust there were not a quality incident to Iron. Their houses they keep cleaner then their bodies, their bodies then their souls. Go to one, you shall find the Andirons shut up in net-work. At a second, the Warming pan muffled in <HI>Italian</HI> Cut-work. At a third the Sconce clad in Cambrick. And like a Crown advanced in the middle of the house, for the woman there is the head of the husband, so takes
<PB N="17" REF="11">
the horn to her own charge, which she sometimes multiplies, and be|stows the increase on her man.</P>
<P>'Tis true, they are not so ready at this play as the <HI>English;</HI> for nei|ther are they so generally bred to't, nor are their men such linnen|lifters. Idleness and Courtship has not banisht honesty. They speak more, and do less; yet doth their blood boil high, and their veins are full, which argues strongly that when they will they may take up the custom of entertaining stran|gers. And having once done it, I believe they will be notable; for I have heard they trade more for love then money, but 'tis of the sport not the man, and therefore when they like the pastim they will reward the Gamester; otherwise their gross feed and clownish bree|ding hath spoiled them from being
<PB N="18" REF="12">
nobly minded. And if you once in publick discover her private favours or pretend to more then is civil, she falls off like Fairy wealth dis|closed, and turns like Beer with Lightening to a sowerness, which neither Art nor Labour can ever make sweet again.</P>
<P>But this I must give you on re|port onely; Experience herein hath neither made me Fool nor Wise.</P>
<P>The People are generally Boor|ish, yet none but may be bred to a States-man, they having all this gift, Not to be so nice-conscienced, but that they can turn out Religi|on to let in Policy.</P>
<P>Their Countrey is the God they worship. War is their Heaven, Peace is their Hell, and the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> is the Devil they hate. Custom is their Law, and their Will Rea|son.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="12">
You may sooner convert a <HI>Iew,</HI> than make an ordinary <HI>Dutch man</HI> yield to arguments that cross him. An old Baud is easilier turned Puri|tan, than a Waggoner persuaded not to bait thrice in 9 miles. And when he doth, his horses must not stir, but have their Manger brought them into the way, where in a top|sweat they eat their grass, and drink their water, and presently after hurry away. For they ever drive as if they were all the sons of <HI>Nimshi,</HI> and were furiously either pursuing an enemy, or flying him.</P>
<P>His spirits are generated from the <HI>English</HI> Beer, and that makes him headstrong. His body is built of pickled Herring, and they render him testy: these with a little But|ter, Onions, and <HI>Holland</HI> Cheese, are the Ingredients of an ordinary <HI>Dutch man;</HI> which a Voyage to the
<PB N="20" REF="13">
<HI>East-Indies,</HI> with the heat of the <HI>Equinoctial Consolidates.</HI></P>
<P>If you see him fat, he hath been rooting in a Cabbage-ground and that bladdered him. Viewing him naked, you will pray him to pull off his Masque and Gloves, or wish him to hide his face that he may appear more lovely. For that and his hands are <HI>Egypt,</HI> however his body <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Europe.</HI> He hath exposed them so much to the Sun and wa|ter, as he is now his own disguise, and without a vizard, may serve in any <HI>Antimasque</HI> you put him in.</P>
<P>For their condition they are churlish as their breeder <HI>Neptune:</HI> and without doubt very ancient; for they were bred before manners were in fashion. Yet all they have not they account superfluity, which they say mendeth some, and mar|reth many.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="13">
They should make good Justices, for they respect neither petsons nor apparel. A boor in his liquord slop, shall have as much good use as a Courtier in his bravery: Nay more, for he that is but Courtly or Gentile, is among them like a <HI>Merlyn</HI> after <HI>Michaelmasi</HI> in the field with <HI>Crowes.</HI> They wonder at and envy, but worship no such Images. Marry with a Silver hook you shall catch these <HI>Gudgeons</HI> pre|sently. The love of gain being to them as natural as water to a Goose, or Carrion to any Kite that flies.</P>
<P>They are seldom deceived; for they trust no body; so by conse|quence are better to hold a fort then win it; yet they can do both. Trust them you must if you travel. For to ask a Bill of particulars, is to purre in a Wasps nest; you must
<PB N="22" REF="14">
pay what they ask, as sure as if it were the Assesment of a Sub|sidy.</P>
<P>Complement is an idleness they were never trained up in, and 'tis their happiness that Court-vani|ties have not stole away their minds from business.</P>
<P>Their being Sailors and Souldi|ers have marred two parts already, if they bath once in Court oyle they are painted Trap-doors And shall then let the <HI>Jews</HI> build a City where <HI>Harlem Mere</HI> is, and after cozen 'em on't.</P>
<P>They shall abuse a stranger for nothing, and after a few base terms scotch one another to a <HI>Carbonado,</HI> or as they do their Roaches when they fry them.</P>
<P>Nothing can quiet them but money and liberty, yet when they have them they abuse both; but if
<PB N="23" REF="14">
you tell them so you awake their fury; and you may sooner calm the sea, then conjure that into com|pass again. Their anger hath no eyes; and their judgment doth not flow so much from reason as passion and partiality.</P>
<P>They are in a manner all <HI>Aqua|tiles,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Spaniard</HI> calls them water-dogs. To this, though you need not condiscend; yet withal, you may think they can catch you a duck as soon. Sea <HI>Gulls</HI> do not swim more readily: nor <HI>More-hens</HI> from then nest run sooner to the water. Every thing is so made to swim among them, as it is a question if <HI>Elizeus</HI> his Axe were now floating there, it would be taken for a mi|racle.</P>
<P>They love none but those that do for them; and when they leave
<PB N="24" REF="15">
off, they neglect him. They have no friends but their kindred, which at every wedding feast among themselves like Tribes.</P>
<P>All that help them not they hold popish; and take it for an argu|ment of much honesty, to rail bit|terly against the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And certainly, this is the badge of an ill Nature, when they have once cast off the yoke, to be most viru|lent against those to whom of right they owe respect and service. Grate|ful dispositions, though by their Lords they be exempt from ser|vice, will yet be paying reverence and affection. <HI>I</HI> am confident, that had they not been once the Subjects of <HI>Spain,</HI> they would have loved the Nation better. But now out of dying Duties ashes all the Blazes of hostility and flame. And 'tis sufficient ground to contemn their
<PB N="25" REF="15">
eternal hate, to know the world remembers, they were once the lawful subjects of that most Catho|lick Crown.</P>
<P>Their shipping is the <HI>Babel</HI> which they boast on for the glory of their Nation. 'Tis indeed a won|der, and they will have it so. But we may well hope they will never be so mighty by Land, left they shew us how doggedly they can insult where they get the mastery.</P>
<P>'Tis their own <HI>Chronicle</HI> business, which can tell you that at the siege of <HI>Leyden,</HI> a Fort being held by the <HI>Spanish,</HI> by the <HI>Dutch</HI> was after taken by assault. The Defendants were put to the sword, where one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the fury of the slaughter, ript up the Captain's body, and with a barbarous hand tore out the yet-lving heart pant|ing among the reeking bowels, then
<PB N="26" REF="16">
then with his teeth rent it still warm with blood into gobbets, which he spitted over the Battel|ments in defiance to the rest of the Army.</P>
<P>Oh Tigres breed! The <HI>Seythian</HI> Bear could never have been more savage To be necessitated into cruelty, is a misfortune to the strongly tempted to it; but to let spleen rave, and mad it in resistless blood, shews nature steep'd i'th' livid gall of passion; and beyond all bruitishness displays the un|noble Tyranny of a prevailing Coward.</P>
<P>Their Navies are the whip of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Arm wherewith they pull away his <HI>Indies.</HI> Nature hath not bred them so active for the land as some others: But at Sea they are water devils, to attempt things incredible.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="16">
In Fleets they can fight close, and rather hazard all then save some, while others perish: but single, they will flag and fear like birds in a bush, when the <HI>Sparrow-Hawks</HI> bells are heard.</P>
<P>A <HI>Turkish</HI> Man of War is as dreadful to them as a <HI>Falcon</HI> to a <HI>Mallard;</HI> from whom their best remedy is to steal away. But if they come to blows, they want the valiant stoutness of the <HI>English,</HI> who will rather expire bravely in a bold resistance, then yield to the lasting slavery of becoming captives to so barbarous an ene|my. And this shews, they have not learned yet even Pagan Philo|sophy, which ever preferred an ho|nourable death before a life thral|led to perpetual slavery.</P>
<P>Their ships lie like high Woods in Winter: and if you view them
<PB N="28" REF="17">
on the north-side you frieze with|out hope, for they ride so thick, that you can through them see no Sun to warm you with.</P>
<P>Sailers among them are as com|mon as beggars with us. They can drink, rail, swear, niggle, steal, and be lowsie alike; but examining their use, a mess of their Knaves are worth a million of ours: for they in a boisterous rudeness can work, and live, and toil, whereas ours will rather laze themselves to po|verty, and like Cabages left out in winter, rot away in the lothsome|ness of a nauseous sloth.</P>
<P>Almost all among them are Sea|men born, and like frogs can live both on land and water. Not a Countrey-Uriester but can handle an oar, steer a boat, raise a mast, and bear you out in the roughest straits you come in. The ship she
<PB N="29" REF="17">
avouches much better for sleep then a bed. Being full of humors, that is her cradle, which lulls and and rocks her to a dull phlegma|tickness, most of them looking like a full grown Oyster boil'd. Slime, humid air, water, and wet dier, have so bag'd their cheeks, that some would take their paunches to be gotten above their chin.</P>
<P>The Countreys Government is a <HI>Democracy,</HI> and there had need be many to rule such a rabble of rude ones. Tell them of a King, and they could cut your throat in earnest. The very name carries servitude in it, and they hate it more then a <HI>Jew</HI> doth Images, a Woman old age, or a Non-conformist a Surplice.</P>

<P>'Tis an University of all Religi|ons which grow here confusedly (like stocks in a Nursery) without either order or pruning.

<P>'Tis the Fair of all the Sects, where all the Pedlers of Religion have leave to vent their toys, their Ribands, and phanatick Rattles. And should it be true, it were a cruel brand which <HI>Romists</HI> stick up|on them. For (say they) as the <HI>Camelion</HI> changes into all Co|lours but white: so they admit

<P>Now albeit the <HI>Papists</HI> do them wrong herein, yet can it not ex|cuse their boundless <HI>Toleration,</HI> which shews they place their Re|publick in a higher esteem then Heaven it self: and had rather cross upon <HI>God</HI> then it. For whoso|ever disturbs the civil Government is liable to punishment: But the

<P>Their apparel is civil enough and good enough, but very uncomly, &amp; has usually more stuffe then shape. Only their <HI>Huykes</HI> are commodious in winter; but 'tis to be lamented, that they have not wit enough to lay them by when Summer comes.</P>
<P>Their women would have good faces if they did not mar them with making. Their <HI>Ear-wyers</HI> have so nip: in their Cheeks, that you

<P>They love the <HI>EnglishGentry</HI> well; and when Soldiers come over to be billeted among them, they are <HI>e|mulous</HI> in chusing of their guest, who fares much the better for be|ing liked by his <HI>Hostess.</HI></P>
<P>Men and women are there <HI>starch|ed so blew,</HI> that if they once grow old, you would verily believe you saw <HI>winter</HI> walking up to the neck in a barrel of <HI>Indigo:</HI> And therefore they rail at <HI>England</HI> for spending no more <HI>blowing.</HI></P>

As for her hand, that shews her a sore La|bourer; which you shall ever find as it were in recompence loaden with Rings to the cracking of her fingers. If you look lower; she's a Monkey chain'd about the middle, and had rather want it in diet, then not have silver links to hang her keys in.</P>

<P>You may rail at us for often changing; but I assure you with them is a great deal more follow|ing the fashion; which they will plead for as the ignorant Laity for their faith. They will keep it be|cause their Ancestors lived in it. Thus they will rather keep an old

<P>For their diet, they eat much and spend little: When they set out a Fleet to the <HI>Indies,</HI> it shall live three months on the Offals, which we here fear would surfeit our swine, yet they feed on't, and are still the same <HI>Dutchmen.</HI></P>
<P>In their houses Roots and Stock|fish are Staple-commodities.

<P>Fish indeed they have brave and plentiful; and herein practice hath made them Cooks as good as ere <HI>Luculbus</HI> his latter Kitchin had, which is some recompence for their wilfulness, for you can nei|ther pray nor buy them to alter their own Cookery.</P>
<P>To a feast they come readily, but being set once you must have pati|ence. They are longer eating meat then we preparing it. If it be to supper, you conclude timely when you get away by day-break. They drink down the evening. Starre, and drink up the morning Starre. At those times it goes hard with a stranger, all in courtesie will be drinking to him, and all that do so he must pledge: till he doth,

<P>The time they there spend, is in eating well, in drinking much, and prating most. For the truth is, the compleatest drinker in <HI>Europe</HI> is your English Gallant. There is no such Consumer of liquor as the Quaffing off of his Healths. Time was the <HI>Dutch</HI> had the better of it; but of late he hath lost it by pra|ting too long over his pot. He sips,

He drinks as if he were short-winded; and as it were eats his drink by morsels, rather besieging his brains then assaulting them. But the <HI>English|man</HI> charges home on the sudden, swallows it whole, and like a hasty tide, fills and flows himself till the mad brain swims, and tosses on the hasty fume. As if his Liver were burning out his stomach, and he striving to quench it, drowns it. So the one is drunk sooner, and the other longer.

<P>The <HI>Ant,</HI> says one, is a wise crea|ture, but a shrewd thing in a Gar|den or Orchard. And truly so are they; For they look upon others too little, and upon themselves too much. And wheresoever they light in a pleasant or rich soyl, like suck|ers and lower plants, they rob from the root of that tree which gives them shade and protection, so their wisdom is not indeed He|roick or Numnial; as Courting an Universal Good; But rather nar|row and restrictive; As being a wis|dom but for themselves, Which to speak plainly, is descending into Craft; and is but the sinister part of that which is really Noble and Coelestiall.</P>

<P>That liberty in man is as the skin to the body, not to be put off, but together with life. That they which will command more than they ought, shall not at last command so much as is fit.</P>
<P>That moderate Princes sit faster in their Regalities, than such as being but men, would yet have their power over their Subjects, as the Gods unlimited. That oppres|sion is an iron heat till it burns the hand. That to debar some States of <HI>antient Priviledges,</HI> is for a Falcon to undertake to beat a flock of Wild-geese out of the Fens. That to go about to compell a sullen reason to submit to a wilfull pe|remptoriness, is so long to beat a chain'd mastiffinto his kennell, till at last he turns and flies at your

That he doth but indanger him|self, that riding with too weak a Bit, provokes a head-strong horse with a spur. That tis safer to meet a valiant man weaponless, then al|most a coward in Armor.

<P>That Admonitions from a dying man are too serious to be negle|cted. That there is nothing cer|tain that is not impossible. That a Cobler of <HI>Vlushing</HI> was one of the greatest enemies that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> ever had.</P>

To conclude, the Country it self is a Moted Castle, keeping a Garnish of the richest Jewels of the world in't; The Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and her Princely Children.</P>
<P>The people in it are Jews of the New Testament that have exchanged nothing but the Law for the Gospel; and this they rather prosess then practice. To|gether a Man of War riding at <HI>Anchor</HI> in the Downs of <HI>Ger|many.</HI></P>
<P>For forein Princes to help them is wise self-policy. When they have made them able to defend themselves against <HI>Spain,</HI> they are at the Pale, if they enable them to offend others they go beyond it. For que|stionless,

<HEAD>A Perfect DESCRIPTION of <HI>Scotland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FIrst, for the Countrey, I must confess it is good for those that possess it, and too bad for others, to be at the charge to conquer it. The Air might be wholsom, but for the stinking people that inhabit it The ground might be fruitful had they wit to manure it.</P>
<P>Their Beasts be generally small, women only excepted, of which sort there are none greater in the whole world. There is great store of Fowl, too, as foul houses, foul sheets,
<PB N="74" REF="40">
foul linen, foul dishes and pots, foul trenchers, and napkins; with which sort, we have been forced to say, as the children did with their fowl in the wilderness They have good store of fish too, and good for these that can eat it raw; but if it come once into their hands, it is worse than if it were three days old. For their Butter and Cheese, I will not meddle with I at this time, nor no man else at any time that loves his life.</P>
<P>They have great store of Deer, but they are so far from the place where I have been, that I had ra|ther believe, than go to disprove it: I confess, all the Deer I met withal, was dear Lodgings, dear Horse-meat, and dear Tobaco, and English Beer.</P>
<P>As sor fruit, for their Grand fire <HI>Adams</HI> sake, they never planted
<PB N="75" REF="40">
any; and for other Trees, had <HI>Christ</HI> been betrayed in this Country, (as doubtless he should, had he come as a stranger) <HI>Judas</HI> had sooner found the Grace of Repentance, than a Tree to hang himself on.</P>
<P>They have many hills, wherein they say is much treasure, but they shew none of it; Nature bath only discovered to them some Mines of Coal, to shew to what end he cre|ated them.</P>
<P>I saw little grass, but in their Potrage: The Thistle is not given of nought, for it is the fairest flower in their Garden. The word Hay is Heathen Greek unto them; neither man nor beast knows what it means.</P>
<P>Corn is reasonable plenty at this time, for since they heard of the Kings comming, it hath
<PB N="76" REF="41">
been as unlawful for the common people to eat Wheat, as it was in the old time for any, but the Priests, to eat shew-bread. They prayed much for his coming, and long fasted for his welfare; but in the more plain sense, that he might fare the better: all his followers were welcom, but his guard; for those they say are like <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> lean Kine, and threaten death wheresoever they come: They could perswade the Foot|men, that oaten cakes would make them long-winded; and the chil|dren of the Chappel they have brought to eat of them, for the maintenance of their voices.</P>
<P>They say our Cooks are too sawcy, and for Grooms and Coach|men they wish them to give to their Horses no worse then they eat themselves; they commend
<PB N="77" REF="41">
the brave mind, of the Pensioners, and the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chambers, which choose rather to go to Taverns, then to be always eating of the Kings provision, they likewise do commend the Yeomen of the Buttery and Cellar, for their readiness and silence, in that they will hear 20 knocks, before they will answer one. They perswade the Trumpeters that fasting is good for men of that quality; for emptiness, they say, causes winde, and winde causes a Trumpet to sound well.</P>
<P>The bringing of Heralds, they say, was a needless charge, they all know their pedigrees wel enough, and the Harbingers might have been spared, s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">he<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ce they brought so many beds with them; and of two evils, since the least should be chosen. They wish the beds
<PB N="78" REF="42">
might remain with them, and poor Harbingers keep their places, and do their office, as they return His Hangings they desire might like|wise be left as Reliquos, to put them in mind of His Majesty; and they promise to dispense with the wooden Images, but for those gra|ven Images in his new beautified Chappel, they threaten to pull down soon after his departure, and to make of them a burnt offering, to appease the indignation they imagined conceived against them in the Brest of the Almighty, for suffering such idolatry to enter in|to their Kingdom; The Organ, I think, will find mercy, because (as they say) there is some affinity be|tween them and the Bag pipes.</P>
<P>The Skipper that brought the singing men with their Papistical Vestments, complains that he hath
<PB N="79" REF="42">
been much troubled with a strange singing in his head, ever since they came aboard his ship. For reme|dy whereof the Parson of the Pa|rish hath perswaded him to fell that prophane Vessel, and to distri|bute the money among the faith|ful Brethren.</P>
<P>For his Majesties entertainment, I must needs ingeniously confess, he was received into the Parish of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> (for a City I cannot call it) with great shouts of joy, but no shews of charg for Pageants; they hold them idolatrous things, and not fit to be used in so refor|med a place; from the Castle they gave him som pieces of Ordnance, which surely he gave them since he was King of <HI>England,</HI> and at the entrance of the town, they pre|sented him with a golden Bason, which was carried before him on
<PB N="80" REF="43">
mens shoulders to his Palace, I think, from whence it came. His Majesty was convey'd by the Youn|kers of the Town, which were about 100 Halberds, (dearly shall they rue it, in regard of the charge) to the Cress and so to the high Church where the only bell they had stood on tip toe to behold his sweet face; where I must intreat you to spare him, for an hour I lost him.</P>
<P>In the mean time to report the Speeches of the people concerning his never-exampled entertainment, were to make his discourse too te|dious unto you, as the Sermon was to those that were constrained to endure it. After the Preachment he was conducted by the same Hal|berds unto his Palace, of which I forbear to speak, because it was a place sanctified by his divine Ma|jesty, only I wish it had been better
<PB N="81" REF="43">
walled for my friends sake that waited on him.</P>
<P>Now I will begin briefly to speak of the people according to their degrees and qualities; for the Lords Spiritual, they may well be termed so indeed, for they are neither Fish nor Flesh, but what it shall please their earthly God, the King, to make them. Obedience is better then Sacrifice, and therefore they make a mock at Martyrdom, say|ing, That Christ was to die for them, and not they for him. They will rather subscribe then surren|der, and rather dispense with small things, then trouble themselves with great disputation; they will rather acknowledge the King to be their head, then want where|with to pamper their bodies.</P>
<P>They have taken great pains and trouble to compass their Bishop|ricks,
<PB N="82" REF="44">
and they will not leave them for a trifle; for the Deacon, whose defects will not lift them up to dignities, all their study is to dis|grace them that have gotten the least degree above them; and be|cause they cannot Bishop, they pro|claim they never heard of any. The Scriptures, say they, speak of Deacons and Elders, but not a word of Bishops. Their Discour|ses are full of detraction; their Sermons nothing but railing; and their Conclusions nothing but Herefies and Treasons. For their Religion they have, I confess they have it above reach, and God-wil|ling I will never reach for it.</P>
<P>They christen without the Cross, marry without the Ring, receiv the Sacrament without reverence, die without repentance, and bury without divine Service; they keep
<PB N="83" REF="44">
no Holy-days, nor acknowledge any Saint but S. <HI>Andrew,</HI> who they said got that honor by presenting Christ with an oaten cake after his forty days fast. They say likewise, that he that translated the Bible was the son of a Maulster, because it speaks of a miracle done by Bar|ley-Loaves, whereas they swear they were Oaten Cakes, and that no other bread of that quantity could have sufficedso many thou|sands.</P>
<P>They use no prayer at all, for they say it is needless, God knows their minds without pratling; and what he doth, he loves to do it freely. Their Sabbaths exercise, is a preaching in the forenoon, and a persecuting in the afternoon; they go to Church in the forenoon to hear the Law, and to the crags and mountains in the afternoon to louz themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="45">
They hold their Noses if you talk of Bear-baiting, and stop their Ears if you speak of a Play: Forni|cation they hold but a pastime, wherein mans ability is approved, and a womans fertility is discover|ed; At Adultery they shake their heads; Theft they rail at; Murther they wink at; and Blasphemy they laugh at; they think it impossible to lose the way to Heaven if they can but leave <HI>Rome</HI> behind them.</P>
<P>To be opposite to the Pope, is to be presently with God; to con|clude, I am perswaded, that if God and his Angels at the last day, should come down in their whi|est Garments, they would run a|way and cry, The Children of the Chappel are come again to tor|ment us, let us flie from the abomi|nation of these boys, and hide our selves in the Mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="45">
For the Lords Temporal and spiritual, temporizing Gentle|men, if I were apt to sp ak of any, I could not speak much of them; only I must let you know they are not Scottishmen, for assoon as they fall from the breast of the beast their mother, their careful fire posts them away for <HI>France,</HI> which as they pass, the Sea sucks from them that which they have suckt from their rude dams; there they gather new flesh, new blood, new manners, and there they learn to put on their cloaths, and then re|turn, into their Countreys, to wear them out; there they learn to stand, speak, discourse and congee, to court women, and to complement with men.</P>
<P>They spared for no cost to honor the King, nor no complemental curtesy to welcom their Country|men;
<PB N="86" REF="46">
their followers are their fel|lows their wives their slaves, their horses their masters, and their swords their Judges; by reason whereof, they have but few labo|rers, and those not very rich: their Parliaments holo but three dayes, their Statutes three lines, and their Suits are determined in a manner in three words, or very few more, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The wonders of their Kingdom are these; the Lord Chancellor, he is believed; the Master of the Rolls, well spoken of; and the whole Councel, who are the Judges for all causes, are free from suspition of corruption. The Country, although it be mountainous, affords no Monsters but Women, of which, the greatest sort (as Countesses, and Ladies) are kept like Lions in Iron grates; the Merchants wives
<PB N="87" REF="46">
are also prisoners, but not in so strong a hold; they have wooden Cages, like our Boar Franks, through which, sometimes peeping to catch the Air, we are almost choaked with the sight of them; the greatest madness amongst the men, is Jealousie; in that they fear what no man that hath but two of his sences will take from them.</P>
<P>The Ladies are of opinion, that <HI>Susanna</HI> could not be chast, be|cause she bathed so often. Pride is a thing bred in their bones, and their flesh naturally abhors cleanli|ness; their breath commonly stinks of Pottage, their linen of Piss, their hands of Pigs turds, their body of sweat, and their splay-feet never offend in Socks To be chained in marriage with one of them, were to be tyed to a dead carkass, and cast into a stinking ditch; Formo|sity,
<PB N="88" REF="47">
and a dainty face, are things they dream not of.</P>
<P>The Oyntments they most fre|quently use amongst them are Brimstone and Butter for the Scab, and Oyl of Bays, and Stave sacre. I protest, I had rather be the mean|est servant of the two of my Pupils Chamber-maids, then to be the Master-Minion to the fairest Coun|tess I have yet discovered. The sin of curiosity of oyntments is but newly crept inro the Kingdom, and I do not think will long continue.</P>
<P>To draw you down by degree from the Citizens Wives, to the Countrey Gentlewomen, and con|vey you to common Dames in Sea+coal lane, that converse with Rags and Marrow-bones, are things o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mineral-race; every whore i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Hound ditch</HI> is an <HI>Helena;</HI> and the greasie Bauds in <HI>Turnmil</HI> street at
<PB N="89" REF="47">
Greekish Dames in comparison of these. And therefore to conclude, The men of old did no more won|der, that the great <HI>Messias</HI> should be born in so poor a town as <HI>Beth|lem</HI> in <HI>Judea,</HI> then I do wonder that so brave a Prince as King <HI>Iames,</HI> should be born in so stinking a Town as <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in lowsie <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
