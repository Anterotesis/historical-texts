<P>THE Sudden and &V;nexpected Breach which hath happened here, between the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> and His Elde&s;t Son; together with the con&s;iderable Dammage which the <HI>Engli&s;h Merchants</HI> have &s;ustained thereby, in the Lo&s;s of their Factory, and a good part of their Trade, hath been Matter of much Wonder and Amazement to us
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y">here; and (I &s;uppo&s;e) no le&s;s, but rather much more to you in <HI>England:</HI> which doth (I imagine) render you de&s;irous to learn the Occa&s;ion and Manner of it; which I herewith &s;end you, hoping it will give you full Satisfaction; for although to be pre&s;ent at, and be a Sufferer in the Extremities of War, and the Com|mon Calamities which always attend the Be&s;ieging and Storming of Cities, yet the hearing thereof at a di|&s;tance, or the reading the written Relations of it, u&s;u|ally afford abundance of Plea&s;ure and Delight e&s;peci|ally when there is any thing extraordinary in the Occa|&s;ion, or in the Manner of Pro&s;ecuting and Managing the War: &s;omewhat of both which you will find in the following Relation.</P>

<P>THE 11th. In&s;tant, this Ship was in readi|ne&s;s To Sail, but was retarded by the King of <HI>Bantam</HI>'s Letter to His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England,</HI> it not being ready till the 13^t^h^. when at Midnight he &s;ent it on Board. The next Morning, by Break of Day, the <HI>Dutch</HI> with Sloops and &s;mall Boats attempted to Land their Men at the Rivers Mouth (which is about a Musket-Shot di&s;tant from our Factory) &s;o that we could not &s;end off our Di&s;patch.</P>
<P>They lay there all that day, and the <HI>Javas</HI> Ar|my clo&s;e by them, who had po&s;itive Orders from the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> not to begin fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> dur&s;t not venture farther, &s;ee|ing a great Number of Men ready to oppo&s;e them,
<PB N="3" REF="3">with far greater Courage than they (or indeed we our &s;elves) did expect; towards Break of Day ye&s;terday, the Water flowing, and their Ve&s;&s;els off the Ground, they all repaired thereto, and &s;tood a little di&s;tance from the Rivers Mouth; when a|bout Nine of the Clock in the Morning, they be|gan the War with their great Guns from their great Ships and Hulks that were moored with their Broad-Sides to the Shoar, for the &s;aid purpo&s;e; and con|tinued Firing as fa&s;t as ever they could till after Sun|&s;et:</P>
<P>The <HI>Javas</HI> manfully kept the Shoar the whole day without much lo&s;s of Men, and fired &s;everal great Guns from the Walls, &s;ome of which did exe|cution on their Ships; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> this Morning have drawn all their &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els from the Shoar, We are in hopes all their future Attempts will be in vain; the <HI>Javas</HI> manife&s;ting a re&s;olute Intention of defying them, rather than come under their Yoke, and are not a little animated with Courage, to &s;ee the <HI>Dutch</HI> retreat.</P>
<P>Our Factory &s;tanding in harms way, we receiv|ed great Shot in abundance; my own, and &s;everal others Chambers, each receiving one: But God be thanked, not a Soul in them hurt: We believe the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent many of them, knowing our Nation to have &s;upplied this King with mo&s;t of his Am|munition, and to animate to our power the <HI>Javas</HI> again&s;t them: whereby we may partly gue&s;s the Kindne&s;s they will &s;hew us if they come on Shoar. Their Fleet remains &s;till in Harbor, and whether they will attempt further, none knows; we are bound to &s;ee the Event; and I hope, happen the
<PB N="4" REF="4">wor&s;t, we &s;hall &s;ave our Lives. <HI>Sir,</HI> I thought it expedient to give you this Account, though the Bearer can &s;atisfie you more largely; yet for what pa&s;&s;ed on Shoar, he has it him&s;elf by hear-&s;ay.</P>

<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I wrote you two Letters by the <HI>Scipio African;</HI> and in that of the later Date, advi&s;ed more par|ticularly the Condition we were then in; which I &s;hall not repeat, but continue the Doleful Subject to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> the Morning before her Departure, being oppo&s;ed Landing, re&s;ted quiet in their Ships till the 28^t^h of <HI>March;</HI> when, before Day, with a fre&s;h Supply of Forces, they Landed half a Mile di&s;tant from our Factory, &s;oon Routed all the <HI>Ja|vas,</HI> and received a welcom Admi&s;&s;ion into the Fort of the Young King (then drove to &s;o great a &s;treight by the Siege of his Fathers Army, that he could not have held out many days longer, and that with the lo&s;s of not above forty or fifty Men) they im|mediately hoy&s;ed their Standard, and what remain'd unde&s;troyed by the Old King's Forces, they that day mo&s;tly burnt, and Marched in Triumph through every part of the Town: We kept our Factory Gates &s;hut, and were by them unmole&s;ted; as like|wi&s;e the <HI>French, Danes</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es:</HI> But the &s;ame
<PB N="5" REF="4">Evening, about Five of the Clock, after we had &s;o|laced our &s;elves with hopes of Security, a Report was &s;pread abroad that the Young King de&s;ign'd to cut us all off that very Night, being incen&s;ed at the conceived A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Men and Ammunition afforded his Father by us during his being be&s;ieged; and thereupon, mo&s;t of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who had for the &s;ecurity of their e&s;tates, brought great part thereof into our Factory, like &s;o many Bees flocked about us, to take the &s;ame out.</P>
<P>It was Night, and we had only on &s;mall Ships Boat on &s;hoar, &s;o we were nece&s;&s;itated to &s;tand the event; and &s;ent her to give notice thereof to our Ships, with Orders to loo&s;e their Sails, get their Anchors apeak, and be gone, and if we were a&s;|&s;aulted, to give Tidings what became of us; not a man of us departing the Shoar that belonged to the Factory; then we put our &s;elves in a po&s;ture of de|fence, hoping, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to make our part good again&s;t all the People the Young King had; dividing our &s;elves into two Watches, my Lot being in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>After Midnight, I went to Re&s;t with &s;omewhat better Hopes than tho&s;e that had the fir&s;t Sleep; as conceiving, if they had any real Design upon us, we &s;hould have heard of it before that time.</P>
<P>Repo&s;e made the remaining hours &s;hort; and the fir&s;t Salute to my waking eyes, was the Glad|&s;om Day; when by a Sign (as appointed) with our Flag, the Ships Boats came on &s;hoar; and &s;oon af|ter the <HI>Dutch</HI> Chief from the <HI>Fort,</HI> with a File of Souldiers, and &s;everal Carpenters came to their <HI>Factory,</HI> into the Yard whereof we had two
<PB N="6" REF="5">Galleries and &s;everal Windows, acquainting us in the mo&s;t imperious manner he could expre&s;s him&s;elf, That it was the King's Order to cut down the one, and &s;top up the other; which if we did not imme|diately do, his People &s;hould: An Action of no|thing but In&s;ultation and Spite, de&s;ign'd to increa&s;e our Fears and Amazement; their Factory being at that time uninhabited, and indeed almo&s;t ruined; yet we were forced to comply: The &s;aid Chief having lived many years in <HI>Bantam,</HI> and been our intimate Companion, induced us to believe his Moro&s;ity might be the effect of his Superiors Or|ders, and that from him we might po&s;&s;ibly under|&s;tand the Reality of the reported Ma&s;&s;acre the night before, and whether &s;till de&s;ign'd; therefore was my &s;elf &s;ent down to him, who told me it was really in|tended, and a going to have been put in execution by the young King, but by their Major he was hin|dred, and di&s;waded therefrom; which, though we believe a Truth, yet next to the Divine Mercy, we can impute it only to the (by them feared) ill Con&s;equences, who by rea&s;on of the &s;mall number of the King's People, could not have acquitted them&s;elves of being acce&s;&s;ary thereto, if not by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, at lea&s;t by their Permi&s;&s;ion, in|a&s;much as it was they that incens'd him again&s;t us, by their aggravating all our Actions what po&s;&s;ibly they could to our Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Upon this we re&s;olved, and accordingly went to the King, to congratulate his &s;afe Delivery out of his late Troubles, that if he had any thing to &s;ay to us, we might clear our &s;elves: Before whom,
<PB N="7" REF="5">when come, we found no &s;uch angry A&s;pect up|on his brow, as by what was reported to us, we had rea&s;on to expect; he reproached us with our a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing his Father, contrary to our <HI>Engagement</HI> of &s;tand|ing Neuter; and what mo&s;t <HI>aggravated,</HI> was, that three of our Company came the day before the <HI>Landing</HI> of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to the Camp, clo&s;e under his Wall, to in&s;truct his Fathers Souldiers how to plant their Great Guns again&s;t him; I was my felf one in per&s;on, with Mr. <HI>George Chowne,</HI> then of Council, and Mr. <HI>Rich. Burnby,</HI> formerly Chief of <HI>Siam,</HI> who went, (as we acquainted him) only out of curio&s;ity to &s;ee the place, upon an Invitation of the Captain that lay there; and as a proof of our Innocency and unthought of giving occa&s;ion of Di&s;plea&s;ure or Di|&s;tru&s;t of his Maje&s;ty, we came within Call of his Soldiers on the Wall, without any other defence, &s;ave our confidence that we not medling or making on ei|ther &s;ide, they would not hurt us (but it &s;hall be a warning to me for ever expo&s;ing my &s;elf to &s;o great a danger upon any &s;uch like Con&s;iderations &s;o long as I live) and that what Supplies we otherwi&s;e af|forded his Father, we were nece&s;&s;itated to, as being wholly under his Power, and him&s;elf then inclo&s;ed in his Fort, and unable to protect us. He interpreted all as excu&s;es, acquainting us that tho' it was in his power to cut us off, yet out of that re&s;pect he had to our King and Company, would de&s;i&s;t therefrom; a Le&s;&s;on learnt him by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Being di&s;mi&s;t, we were the 31^&s;^t con|&s;tantly affrighted with his Men in Arms, coming to our <HI>Factory,</HI> under the conduct of one or other of his three great Mini&s;ters of State he had left him, or a <HI>Dutch</HI> Re|negado, by him highly advanced, whom we knew not
<PB N="8" REF="6">how to tru&s;t, neither dur&s;t deny Admittance; when in the evening, the Chief of the &s;aid Mini&s;ters, he that has been above two years underhand with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> contriving to bring the De&s;ign about of get|ting <HI>Bantam,</HI> came to us with a Paper written in the <HI>Mallay</HI> Language, &s;aid to be &s;ent us from the King; being an Order to us, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to get our Goods aboard our Ships, and depart his Coun|trey; he pre&s;&s;ing us to the mo&s;t &s;peedy compliance po&s;&s;ible therewith, as we &s;tood in awe of the Kings Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We were &s;ince informed that there was a great Di&s;pute between the King and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Major, before he could be brought to Order us out of his Countrey, well con&s;idering how great a Support to, and Inrichment of his Kingdom our Trade had been: But being wholly under the <HI>Dutch</HI> Power, he was forced to comply, and we to his Commands; and &s;o purpo&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to get off our Goods, and depart for <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>But our Ships being mo&s;t of them nigh full, we were nece&s;&s;itated to reque&s;t a Ship of near five hun|dred Tuns, of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Major, to export them; &s;o the next Morning we wrote a Letter to him, which we &s;ent by four of the Companies Servants, to deliver; who coming to the <HI>Fort,</HI> the Captain of the Guard told them he was a&s;leep: Where|upon they left it with him, and returned home.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t we were expecting of an An&s;wer, the &s;ame evening comes to us the above&s;aid Mini&s;ter and Votary to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with the &s;aid Letter unopen|ed, &s;eating him&s;elf at the upper end of our Table, and filling our Great Hall with his followers, cal|ling
<PB N="9" REF="6">for Mr. <HI>Barwell,</HI> and &s;ome others of the Coun|cil, who coming before him, he takes forth the Let|ter, and tells us with Rage, the <HI>King</HI> had &s;ent him to know the meaning of that Papers being found on the Ground under the <HI>Fort</HI>-Walls, <HI>aggravating</HI> it as a Cau&s;e of the highe&s;t Su&s;pition, now in time of War; and when we had told him what it was, and laboured to make him &s;en&s;ible that it was our <HI>Europe</HI> Cu&s;tom to &s;ignifie our Minds in Writing, and that our Meaning therein was mo&s;t innocent, he replied, he admired how we dur&s;t pre&s;ume to write to the Major without fir&s;t acquainting the <HI>King;</HI> and all this with &s;o much Pa&s;&s;ion and Fury, that nothing could look more like a Prologue to a Ma&s;&s;acre; till at length he mildly advi&s;ed us the next morning to go and ask the <HI>King</HI>'s Pardon.</P>
<P>Many other Circum&s;tances of Amazement in this Bu&s;ine&s;s did pa&s;s, too tedious to repre&s;ent: But by what we have &s;aid, you may <HI>imagine</HI> the ba&s;ene&s;s of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who were the whole Contrivers and Au|thors of this Bu&s;ine&s;s, as did plainly appear by that Letter being delivered into their hands, and the <HI>King</HI>'s not <HI>mentioning</HI> one word to us about it, the next <HI>Morning,</HI> notwith&s;tanding we never offered to ask him Pardon.</P>
<P>But this is but little to their <HI>&s;ucceeding Treatments,</HI> as you will &s;ee by what follows: That day we had &s;ent off two of our Ships Boats full of <HI>Broad|cloath,</HI> which without the Rivers Mouth were fol|lowed by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pinnace, <HI>ordering,</HI> them <HI>back again,</HI> or el&s;e they would fire at them.</P>
<P><HI>Their Return &s;urprized us; but not knowing but its being late at night, might be the occa&s;ion, we &s;ent them
<PB N="10" REF="7">again the next morning, when they were again &s;topped by the</HI> Dutch <HI>Souldiers quartering a little below our Facto|ry, who told us they had Orders to &s;uffer no loaden Boat of ours to go out of the River: we complained to the Major, who told us it was the King's Order; who, alas poor man! had &s;o &V;n-King'd him&s;elf, that he could Com|mand no further than &s;tood with the Plea&s;ure of the</HI> Dutch; <HI>but many hours did not pa&s;s before we under&s;tood the depth of the De&s;ign, by one</HI> Jacob de Roy, <HI>a Lieutenant in the</HI> Dutch <HI>Army, who had been with the King all the time of his being be&s;ieged in the Fort, coming &s;ome few Months before, under pretence of being a Baker to</HI> Ban|tam, <HI>who brought us a Charge of about ten thou&s;and Ri|als</HI> 8/8 <HI>for Jewels and Plate of his in the</HI> Dutch <HI>Factory, which at the time of the Old King's entering the Town, he &s;aid we had plundered and taken into ours, which till we &s;atisfied, none of our Goods &s;hould be permitted to go on board, where by the way, you may ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, their de|&s;ign &s;o far to amaze and affright us, that we might upon any Terms be willing to leave the &s;hoar; and then having &s;o prepared us, to enrich them&s;elves with the Companies and our E&s;tate. Indeed this Bu&s;ine&s;s at that time &s;tart|led us, and made us very thoughtful concerning them, much fearing &s;ome ill De&s;ignes upon us, we laboured by Pre&s;ents to the King's Mini&s;ters, to learn the depth of the De&s;ign, and divert it; but in conclu&s;ion found them too much the</HI> Dutch <HI>Votaries, to be our Friends: in&s;omuch that we were wholly to &s;eek what to do: Whil&s;t to perplex us yet further, comes a Me&s;&s;age to us, that the King was jea|lous of our a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Fathers Boats with Powder from our Ship in the Road, therefore de&s;ired us to deliver up all on Board them, which, when we departed, &s;hould be faith|fully re&s;tored.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<P>We replied, That when we delivered our Powder, we delivered our Ships, they being without it whol|ly defencele&s;s, therefore would upon no Terms do it, but would our &s;elves go &s;peak with the King, which accordingly we did; when coming into his pre&s;ence were prevented &s;aying any thing to him, he immediately &s;ending for a Letter wrote in <HI>Por|tugueze</HI> and directed to the Engli&s;h as from one of the Old Kings Sons, which he ordered to be read to us; the Contents were, That we the <HI>French</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> &s;hould at a certain time be in readine&s;s for their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, but where or how, we knew not; which he aggravated highly again&s;t us, not per|mitting to &s;peak in our defence, or to &s;ay any thing concerning the &s;toppage of our Goods, or our Powder being demanded out of our Ships, and bid us be gone; from whom being departed, we went to the Dutch Major, making known our Grievance to him, who &s;milling, told us, All was by Order of the King, though done by their Souldiers, and &s;eem'd ignorant of the Letter, tho nothing more probable than that it was of their own framing; and promi&s;ed in ge|neral Terms to a&s;&s;i&s;t us to his power: &s;o took our leaves, and being return'd to our Factory, we heard the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Ship was &s;eized on by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Javas</HI> together, with an Account of the &s;aid Letter, and that the <HI>French</HI> had ta|ken out of her of theirs 4 Che&s;ts of Money, ha|ing put the &s;ame on board of her for &s;ecurity in the time of the Siege: And that the afore&s;aid
<PB N="12" REF="8"><HI>Jacob de Roy</HI> with &s;ome other Souldiers of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and Kings, went to the Honourable Com|panies Ship the <HI>Tywan Frigat,</HI> acquainting the Commander they had Orders to &s;earch for Powder; who telling them they had none, neither could permit thereof without Orders from us a&s;hore: They were about to enter the Ship, he immediately gave the word for his Men to &s;tand to their Arms, where|upon they de&s;i&s;ted, gave him good words, and de&s;ired that only <HI>Jacob de Roy</HI> and one <HI>Ja|va</HI> Man, might be permitted to look between Decks for &s;atisfaction of the King, which being granted they departed. This News I &s;ay, with our Treatment with the King and Major, &s;eem'd almo&s;t to confirm to us &s;ome evil De&s;igns, if not upon our Lives, at lea&s;t upon the Companies and our E&s;tates. But it being no time to &s;it &s;till, we concluded immediately to di&s;|patch away the <HI>Formo&s;a Frigat</HI> (a &s;mall Ship of the Companies) to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to make our Com|plaints to the General and Council there, but chiefly to &s;ecure the Honourable Companies Trea&s;ure, which was the thing they &s;eem'd to gape at, My &s;elf and Mr. <HI>George Chowne</HI> were &s;ent upon her, and indeed it was our de|&s;ires to go, having had notice that the King had been &s;olicited by the <HI>Dutch Renegado</HI> (a Villain fitted for the wor&s;t of Actions) to come to our Factory and kill us in particular, upon account of our being &s;een in his Enemies Camp at the time of his being be&s;ieged; to which altho he
<PB N="13" REF="8">declin'd condi&s;cending, who knew what the importunity of &s;uch a Villain in time might a|mount to. We departed the Shore in a &s;mall Boat, about <HI>half an hour</HI> before Sun &s;et, with Order for all the Companies Trea&s;ure on board the Companies other Ships, to be put on board her in the dark, and with the &s;malle&s;t noi&s;e po&s;&s;ible to weigh <HI>Anchor,</HI> le&s;t we &s;hould have been di&s;covered by the <HI>Dutch Ships.</HI> There ac|companied us the Agents Lady, Mr. <HI>Thomas James</HI> late Chief of <HI>Tonkeene,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rich.

<PB N="14" REF="9">left there of Council to come away, that they could no other ways agree who &s;hould) the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Bantam</HI> not having any of our Goods at his departure to be brought off. And their pro|ceedings being &s;uch, under Colour of the Kings Orders, as forced our people to take care to &s;e|cure what E&s;tate the Company had already off the Shore, he and I again waited on the General, who told us, That we might hire an Hou&s;e where we pleas'd, that he would order a Ship or two, if occa&s;ion was, by the fir&s;t opportunity; as likewi&s;e, that our Goods &s;hould be all &s;afely brought avvay, and for vvhat vve had further reque&s;ted, vvould after they had debated it, give An&s;vver: But before his Order reached <HI>Bantam,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> there &s;eeing two of our Ships gone a|way in the Night time, and imagining in them to be the chiefe&s;t Trea&s;ure, permitted them to load the other &s;mall one and Sloop there remain|ing, putting the King upon ha&s;tening our peo|ple away, with all &s;peed imaginable, &s;eizing all the Provi&s;ions in the Factory, that they were forced to live the day before they left the Shore upon the Charity of the <HI>Chine&s;s.</HI> And on the 12th of <HI>April</HI> arrived here the <HI>Tywan Frigat,</HI> vvith all our People from <HI>Bantam,</HI> except one Factor, who as if by mi&s;take &s;tayed behind to have an Eye to their Actions.
