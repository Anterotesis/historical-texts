<HEAD>THE BOOKSELLERS TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e Two Tomes of <HI>Travels</HI> and <HI>Voya|ges</HI> containing great Variety, both as to the &s;everal Countries, the Ob&s;ervations, and Authors of them, we think it proper to give the World a &s;hort account of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is <HI>Rauwolf,</HI> a Per&s;on very famous for his Skill in Natural Products, and in the Practi&s;e of Phy&s;ick, who&s;e Itinerary into the Ea&s;tern Countries being written in <HI>High Dutch,</HI> was grown very rare, valued as a Manu&s;cript, and much de&s;ired by &s;ome learned Gentlemen, who are ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd to have a delicate Ta&s;te and fine Judgment in the choice of Books and Subjects; therefore being infor|med that the <HI>High Dutch</HI> Copy of the&s;e Tra|vels was only to be found in the <HI>Arundelian</HI> Library at <HI>Gre&s;ham College,</HI> we freely under|took the Charge of having it tran&s;lated, and printed in our Language, which is here perfor|med with great care and diligence.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">The Plants collected by the worthy Author Dr. <HI>Leonhart Rauwolff,</HI> in his Itinerary, were curiou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd by the late <HI>I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> in four large Volumes, and ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd by that great man as the mo&s;t noble Rarity and Ornament of his <HI>Bibliotheque,</HI> which when it came to be &s;old to the &V;niver&s;ity of <HI>Leyden,</HI> was particularly valued by the Great <HI>Heer van Beverning,</HI> for the&s;e Volumes of dry'd Plants collected by our Author in his Travels of the Ea&s;tern Countries; and tho' &s;ome per|haps may give a &s;light Character of him, for a Mi&s;take or two about <HI>Pre&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r John</HI> and the <HI>Unicorn,</HI> yet if they con&s;ider, that he only re|lates what he accidentally heard of them from others, they ought to take that part only as a Story told him upon the Road, as he him&s;elf indeed delivers it. But this may very truly be &s;aid of <HI>Rauwolff,</HI> that whatever he writes upon his own Ob&s;ervation or Knowledge, is mo&s;t faithful and &s;incere; therefore it was not without Rea&s;on, that <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius</HI> and the two <HI>Bauhines</HI> (all very good Judges) depen|ded &s;o much upon him, and made &s;uch frequent and honourable mention of this Itinerary.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e &s;ome might think that the aforementioned Journey of Dr. <HI>Leonhart Rau|wolff</HI> was con&s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to too narrow a compa&s;s of Ground, and to &s;ome Countries not much fre|quented, as <HI>Arme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia, Me&s;opotamia, A&s;&s;yria, Babylonia, Judea. &amp;c.</HI> we therefore con&s;ulted a Friend, how to render the Piece more u&s;e|ful
<PB REF="4">
to the Publick, who advi&s;ed us to extend it to many other places of the <HI>Levant,</HI> where <HI>Rauwolff</HI> never travell'd, as <HI>Greece, Egypt,</HI> and other adjacent Countries, bordering near the Sphere of <HI>Rauwolff</HI>'s Itinerary: This being thought mo&s;t &s;erviceable to the Re|publick of Learning, we immediately conclu|ded to &s;upply and enlarge <HI>Rauwolff</HI> with a Second Tome, out of &s;ome of the mo&s;t renowned Travellers of tho&s;e parts of the World, &s;uch as <HI>Bellonius, Alpinus, Ve&s;lingius,</HI> Mr. <HI>Greaves,</HI> Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> and many others of great Fame and Reputation for their excellent Ob&s;ervati|ons in the <HI>Levant,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hun|tingdon,</HI> Dr. <HI>Spon,</HI> Sir <HI>G. Wheeler,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To the&s;e we have added &s;omething of <HI>Ara|bia Felix</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which curious per&s;ons may be de&s;irous to read, being taken from Ori|ginal and Authentick Voyages.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, We prevail'd with Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> to draw up three Catalogues at the end, contain|ing the Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs growing in the <HI>Levant</HI> part of the World, together with their various &s;ynonimous Names, which do much illu&s;trate and beautifie the whole.</P>
<P>But before we take Leave, a Point of Ho|nour, of Candor and Ingenuity ought not to be forgotten, which is a decent acknowledgment of the Writings from whence the &s;everal parts of the Second Tome were extracted, for the benefit of the Reader; the&s;e were <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI>'s Edition of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Belon</HI>'s Itinerary, by
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Plantine</HI> at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> The <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ob&s;er|vations of <HI>Alpinus,</HI> printed at <HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Ve|nice.</HI> The <HI>Pyramidographia</HI> of Mr. <HI>Greaves.</HI> The Collections of Voyages and Travels, by <HI>Ramu&s;io, Hakluyt, Purchas,</HI> and <HI>Thevenot.</HI> The Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Oldenburg,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and afterwards by Dr. <HI>Plot</HI> at <HI>Oxford:</HI> To which we may add &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> into foreign Countries; &s;uch we mean only as applied them&s;elves to Topo|graphical and Philo&s;ophical Ob&s;ervations, as Father <HI>Alvarez,</HI> Father <HI>Lobo,</HI> Father <HI>Tellez,</HI> and Father <HI>Van&s;leb,</HI> who, &s;etting a&s;ide the bu|&s;ine&s;s of their Calling and Mi&s;&s;ion, are not only worthy of entring the Li&s;t of Gentlemen Tra|vellers, and Virtuo&s;o's, but of appearing in a Prote&s;tant Kingdom. From all the&s;e we fetcht Materials for the forming and rai&s;ing our Se|cond Volume, which we cannot but hope will prove beneficial and grateful to the Publick, &s;eeing we had no other de&s;ign in it, than pure|ly that of plea&s;ing and in&s;tructing, as well as of enlarging the Empire of Knowledge.</P>

<P>THE Ancient Philo&s;ophers were wont not unfitly to compare the &s;tudy and pur&s;uit of Ingenious Arts and Sciences to the practi&s;e of Merchandizing; for as Merchants fear no Dangers, neither &s;pare any Pains or Co&s;t in travelling to foreign Countries, by Sea and Land, that they may procure and bring thence, to furni&s;h their Store-hou&s;es, &s;uch
<PB REF="6">
Goods and Commodities as they chiefly deal in. So tho&s;e who make the attainment of Skill in the fore|mentioned Liberal Arts their princi|pal End, and the &s;tudy thereof their Delight, are not deterred from pro|&s;ecuting this De&s;ign, by any di&s;tan|ces of Places, by Winter or Summer, fearing neither Rain nor Snow, nor the traver&s;ing of horrid De&s;arts, or the wild and roaring Seas, nor wa|&s;ting or weakening their Patrimonies, if at la&s;t they can but arrive at tho&s;e places, where they may gain the ac|quaintance and familiarity of emi|nently-learned Ma&s;ters, able to in|&s;truct them in tho&s;e Arts and Scien|ces, to the Knowledge and Compre|hen&s;ion whereof they a&s;pire; or where they may inform them&s;elves of the Con&s;titutions and Cu&s;toms of famous Nations, and of other things &s;ub&s;ervient to their Intentions. We have an In&s;tance of this in the Wi&s;e Philo&s;opher and famous Law-giver <HI>Solon,</HI> who (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the De|&s;cription
<PB REF="6">
of his Life remarketh) tra|velled through many foreign Coun|tries, to acquire the knowledge of their Government and Polity, their Laws and Con&s;titutions, in order to the qualifying and enabling him&s;elf to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign of giving Laws to his own. We read al&s;o in <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> that <HI>Plato</HI> did tra|vel to <HI>Megara,</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Euclide</HI>; to <HI>Cyrene,</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Theodorus Mathemati|cus</HI>; into <HI>Italy,</HI> to encounter the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Philo&s;ophers; and al&s;o into <HI>Egypt,</HI> to conver&s;e with the Prie&s;ts and Sages there, &s;o mightily cried up in the World, and to ac|quaint him&s;elf with their Learning and My&s;teries: Moreover, that he intended a Journey into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> had he not been hinder'd by a War then newly commenced.</P>
<P>After the &s;ame manner <HI>Galen</HI> writes of him&s;elf, That he &s;ailed to <HI>Lemnos, Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Pale&s;tina</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee foreign Plants, and rare Oares and Minerals.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">To relate what great Troubl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Dangers tho&s;e that have written of Exotick Plants to this day have &s;u&s;tained and incurred in their foreign <HI>Peregrinations,</HI> would not be grievous to me, did I not fear that it would extend this Dedication to too di&s;pro|portionate and tedious a length; wherefore I will omit it, and briefly touch what concerns my &s;elf, mine own Inclinations to travel, and pro|ceedings in pur&s;uance thereof.</P>
<P>Although I dare not compare my &s;elf with tho&s;e Excellent and Incom|parable Per&s;ons newly mentioned, nor boa&s;t of any high <HI>&V;nder&s;tanding, Ex|perience,</HI> or <HI>Learning,</HI> (&s;o far as I know my &s;elf) yet to confe&s;s the Truth, I am forced to own, that from my Infancy I alwaies had a great de&s;ire to Travel into foreign parts, and to enquire out Learned and Fa|mous Men, that I might get &s;ome|thing of them to encrea&s;e my Stock of Knowledge. From whence it did proceed (I having chiefly before all
<PB REF="7">
other Faculties, a great inclination to the Study of Phy&s;ick, and finding that it required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a great many Sciences more, and e&s;pe|cially Skill in Botanicks) that after &s;erious and mature deliberation, with the Con&s;ent of my Parents and Re|lations, and at their Expences, I did leave the <HI>German</HI> Univer&s;ities, and travelled into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> where the Knowledge and Practi&s;e of Me|dicine doth chiefly flouri&s;h, where al&s;o &s;everal rare Plants of great u&s;e in Phy&s;ick, do naturally grow; to acquaint my &s;elf with which, and to gain the knowledge of them I have taken abundance of pains, and chie|fly at <HI>Montpellier,</HI> where in company with the highly learned <HI>Jeremias Martius,</HI> Doctor of Phy&s;ick, I wan|der'd over &s;everal Hills and Valleys in many places, but chiefly the high Mountain <HI>Ceti,</HI> &s;ituate near <HI>Frontig|nan,</HI> on the Sea-&s;hore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which means I gathered &s;everal hundreds of Simples, and kept them by me as a Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">But when I began to con&s;ult Au|thors concerning them, finding a great many others, no le&s;s u&s;eful and advantageous in <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> that were &s;aid to grow in <HI>Greece, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Arabia, &amp;c.</HI> I was highly therewith plea&s;ed, chiefly when I found al&s;o tho&s;e fruitful places of the Ea&s;tern Countries de&s;cribed, which &s;everal Authors, and above all the Holy Scriptures have mentioned; and from thence I was enflamed with a vehement de&s;ire to &s;earch out, and view &s;uch <HI>Plants</HI> growing &s;ponta|neou&s;ly in their Native places, and propounded al&s;o to my &s;elf to ob|&s;erve the Life, Conver&s;ation, Cu|&s;toms, Manners, and Religion of the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Countries. And although I did not then imme|diately put this my de&s;ign in execu|tion, but delay'd for &s;everal years, doing mean while what Service I could to my Native Country, yet I embraced the fir&s;t opportunity that offer'd it &s;elf of accompli&s;hing it:
<PB REF="8">
For when my decea&s;ed Brother-in-law Mr. <HI>Melchior Manlich</HI> wi&s;hed me to take a Voyage into the Ea&s;tern Coun|tries, to find out their Drugs and Simples, and other things convenient and profitable for his Trade, and did promi&s;e me requi&s;ite Charges, and a con&s;iderable Salary, I immediately ac|cepted his agreeable Offer, and rea|dily embraced &s;o often-de&s;ir'd an op|portunity, and addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf in|&s;tantly to the Magi&s;trates of this City (for I was then in their Service) cra|ved Leave to go; which I had no &s;ooner obtained, but I began my Tra|vels into the <HI>Levant:</HI> What I &s;aw, learned, and experienc'd, during the &s;pace of Three years, (for &s;o much time this Journey took me up) not without great danger and trouble, I con&s;igned all in good order, as it oc|curred daily, in a Pocket-Journal, to keep as a Memorial of my Life.</P>
<P>But after I returned home again, being de&s;ir'd, nay, continually impor|tun'd by &s;everal <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and others,
<PB REF="9">
my very good Friends, to commu|nicate this my Itinerary to them, and to make it publick. At la&s;t, after many Refu&s;als, not being able any longer to re&s;i&s;t their Solicitations, I was prevailed upon to comply with their De&s;ires, to publi&s;h it in Print.</P>
<P>Wherefore I looked my Itinerary over again, and whatever Curio&s;ities I had ob&s;erved, I did tran&s;cribe into a peculiar Diary, which I divided in|to three parts, according as I travel|led into &s;everal Countries, and com|mitted it to the Pre&s;s, that I might communicate Copies thereof to my Friends.</P>
<P>It is not Vain-glory that hath prompted me to do this, but rather the Profit and Plea&s;ure it may afford the Reader; that tho&s;e who have no opportunity to vi&s;it foreign Coun|tries, may have it before their Eyes, as a Map, to contemplate; and that others may be excited further to en|quire into the&s;e things, and induced, by reading this Account, to Travel
<PB REF="9">
them&s;elves into tho&s;e parts whereof I have written, to ob&s;erve that more narrowly and exactly wherein I have been too &s;hort.</P>
<P>But if any &s;hall object, and &s;ay, That I might have &s;pared this Labour and Trouble, and employed it to bet|ter purpo&s;es; and, that the pre&s;ent State, Condition, Situation, and Man|ners of the World have been &s;o ful|ly &s;urveyed and de&s;cribed by others, that there is hardly a corner of it left un&s;earched. To this I an&s;wer, That what others have written I have not tran&s;cribed into this Work, but what I have &s;een, experienc'd, ob&s;erv'd and handl'd my &s;elf, is only mentioned here: But if any one hath already, out of the like Books printed before, lear|ned all the&s;e things, &s;o that nothing here propounded is new to him, I con|fe&s;s this my Labour is of no u&s;e to &s;uch an one, neither have I written it for him. But he that by daily experi|ence ob&s;erveth how <HI>Wars, Plagues, Di&s;tempers,</HI> and other Accidents, may
<PB REF="10">
and do mightily alter <HI>Kingdoms, Coun|tries, Cities,</HI> and <HI>Towns,</HI> &s;o that what was prai&s;ed formerly as glorious and beautiful, lyeth now de&s;olate and in A&s;hes, and what then was accounted barren and wa&s;te, may be now be|come fruitful and glorious; he will confe&s;s, that &s;till in our times a great many things remain to be &s;earch'd and enquir'd into, which others before us never did nor could ob&s;erve, treat of, or publi&s;h. Pur&s;uant to this the wi&s;e <HI>Solon</HI> before mentioned &s;aid, <HI>That he grew old, continually learning many things.</HI></P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
<P>And <HI>Julian</HI> the Law-giver was wont to &s;ay, <HI>That if one of his Feet were in his Grave, yet he &s;hould be de&s;irous to learn.</HI></P>
<P>If this my Work doth not make or improve Divines, Lawyers, or Phy&s;i|cians, (for which purpo&s;e I never in|tended it) yet I hope &s;ome way or other it may be as well u&s;eful as plea|&s;ant
<PB REF="10">
to them and others; for who&s;o|ever &s;hall read in this my Itinerary, how the glorious and &s;trong City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> is now ruin'd, and become a heap of Stones, and great <HI>Babylon</HI> laid in A&s;hes, and other famous places in like manner de&s;troyed and de&s;olate, the Land of Promi&s;e al&s;o changed in|to a barren Ground, he may thence collect, that the Wrath of God is a <HI>con&s;uming Fire,</HI> that he hath not only not &s;pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the <HI>Jews,</HI> his elect and pe|culiar People, which he cho&s;e for his Inheritance, but al&s;o de&s;troyed that once fruitful Land, <HI>flowing with Milk and Honey,</HI> which tho' it &s;elf did not &s;in, yet he hath cur&s;ed with Barren|ne&s;s, for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of its In|habitants, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107.30. and turned the holy City into a de&s;olation and &s;olitude; the due con&s;ideration where|of would be an effectual Motive to provoke <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to amend their Lives and Manners; for, if this was done in the Green Tree, the cho&s;en People of God, what will become of
<PB REF="11">
the Dry, if once the wrath of the Lord be kindled.</P>
<P>Moreover, he that by this Book is in&s;tructed in the Manners, Cu&s;toms, Laws and Orders of the People of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and what Tricks and Cunning they make u&s;e of, in time both of Peace and War, will know the better how to behave him&s;elf in all his Ne|ce&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions of Traffick and Dealings with them.</P>
<P>Further, this Book al&s;o teacheth a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> how to behave him&s;elf in his Slavery, (if it &s;hould befal him) to|wards his Ma&s;ter, without any detri|ment to his Soul or Con&s;cience; and how by convenient means he may procure his Liberty again.</P>
<P>You may al&s;o &s;ee here how many Sects of Religions there are in the&s;e places, and how there are many good and well-di&s;po&s;ed People, which are not far from the true knowledge of God, and might ea&s;ily be brought to embrace the Orthodox Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB REF="11">I hope al&s;o that this my Work will not be very unacceptable to Apo|thecaries and Phy&s;icians, containing De&s;criptions of many u&s;eful Herbs, of which I had willingly added the Cuts, but was forced to forbear at pre&s;ent, for &s;everal Rea&s;ons, not need|ful here to be related, but I hope it may be done afterwards, when Time and Opportunity &s;hall &s;erve.</P>
<P>You will likewi&s;e find here &s;everal &s;trange Stories, both plea&s;ant to read, and which may give occa&s;ion to higher Con&s;iderations: So that I am in good hopes I &s;hall not have taken all the&s;e Pains, and u&s;ed this Diligence altoge|ther in vain.</P>
<P>Now, Honoured Gentlemen and Cou&s;ins, to return to you; Sith it hath been always u&s;ed by Writers, both ancient and modern, to dedicate their Books to &s;ome per&s;on or other, I al&s;o in compliance with this laudable Cu&s;tom, have thought fit to dedicate this my Itinerary to you, not only be|cau&s;e
<PB REF="12">
of that Relation we &s;tand in to each other, by rea&s;on of con&s;anguinity, but al&s;o to acknowledge my Obligati|ons, and declare my Gratitude for the many Favours, Good-turns, and Friendly Offices done me by Mr. <HI>Leon|hart Chri&s;tel,</HI> our dear Uncle of pious Memory (in who&s;e Steps you Mr. <HI>Ni|cholas Bemer,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;topher Chri&s;tel,</HI> the Heirs as well of his Virtues as his E&s;tate, do tread) when he was alive, and do &s;till at pre&s;ent receive of you three my Honoured Kin&s;men; which my well-meaning Dedication I hope you will favourably accept, and own and acknowledge as your Cou&s;in.</P>

After an Hours walk we came in &s;ight of him, and &s;aw about thirty Tents, and among&s;t them his al&s;o, where we &s;aw &s;ome curious Tape&s;try &s;pread, and him &s;itting in the mid&s;t, with a delicate white Tur|bant, and a long red lined <HI>Caban.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEfore <HI>Tripoli</HI> near the Sea-&s;hore, we &s;aw five Ca&s;tles like high Towers di&s;tant from one an other about a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, where &s;ome Jani&s;aries are kept in Garri&s;on, to cover the Ships in the Harbour (which is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;urrounded with Rocks) and to defend that Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and the &s;everal Ware-hou&s;es (where you may &s;ee all &s;orts of Goods brought from mo&s;t parts of the World) from any ho&s;tile Attempt or A&s;&s;ault: but after the Sun was &s;et, and Night began to approach we made what ha&s;te we could to the Town, which was an Hours going di&s;tant from us. Some <HI>Turks</HI> went with us no other ways armed but with good &s;trong Cudgels, which, as I was told, they com|monly carry to keep off the Wolves called <HI>Jacals</HI> (whereof there are a great many in the&s;e Countries that are u&s;ed to run, &s;eek and pur|&s;ue after their Prey in the Night.) While we were a talking of them &s;ome came up pretty near us, but as &s;oon as they &s;aw us they turned and ran away. When we came to the Gate of the Town, we found it &s;hut up, wherefore one of our Friends (that met us to make us welcom)
<PB N="20" REF="26">
called to &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Men that were in their Inn, in their Language called <HI>Fondique,</HI> which is near the Gate, and reacheth quite to the Wall of the Town, and de&s;ired that one of them would take the Pains to go to the <HI>Sangiacho,</HI> to de&s;ire him to let the Gate be opened to let us in, which they were willing to do. But in the mean time that we &s;taid before the Gate, ano|ther that was an Enemy to our Friend ran al&s;o away, and be&s;poke &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> to &s;et upon us, which they were very willing to do, and came with all &s;peed through another Gate that is never &s;hut, along the Wall to us, fell un|awares upon us, &s;truck at us, and took hold of us, chiefly at our good Friend, for who&s;e &s;ake all this was done: others drew their Scymmeters upon us, &s;o that I thought we &s;hould have been all cut to pieces. While this was a doing the Gate was opened, and &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Men and their <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> him&s;elf came to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;poke to the&s;e Fellows, earne&s;tly exhorting them to de&s;i&s;t, and to let the Cau&s;e be decided by the <HI>Sangiacho</HI> and <HI>Cadi,</HI> which at length they did. So we came after this unfriendly welcome in the Croud into their <HI>Fondique,</HI> where we re|mained all that night. The Con&s;ul was very much di&s;plea&s;ed at this, con&s;idering that &s;uch like Proceedings would be very trouble&s;ome to them, wherefore he made great Complaints and Enquiries, until at length he found out who was the Author thereof.</P>
<P>The next Morning we went to our Friends Hou&s;es in order to &s;tay a while with them: in the mean time we walked &s;ometimes about in our own Cloaths to &s;ee the Town, which is &s;ituated in the Country of <HI>Syria,</HI> called <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> which reached along the Sea-&s;hore, to <HI>Berinthus,
<PB N="21" REF="26">
Sidon, Tyrus</HI> and <HI>Acon,</HI> as far to the Mountain of <HI>Carmelus.</HI> The Town <HI>Tripoli</HI> is pretty large, full of People, and of good account, becau&s;e of the great Depo&s;ition of Merchandizes that are brought thither daily both by Sea and Land, it is &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant Country, near the pro|montory of the high Mountain <HI>Libanus,</HI> in a great Plain toward the Sea-&s;hore, where you may &s;ee abundance of Vineyards, and very fine Gardens, enclo&s;ed with Hedges for the mo&s;t part, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of <HI>Rhamnus, Paliurus, Oxyacantha, Phillyrea, Lycium, Balau&s;tium, Rubus</HI> and little <HI>Palm-Trees,</HI> that are but low, and &s;o &s;prout and &s;pread them&s;elves. In the&s;e Gar|dens as we came in, we found all &s;orts of Sal|letting and Kitchin-herbs, as <HI>Endive, Lettice, Ruckoli, A&s;paragus, Seleri,</HI> who&s;e tops are very good to be eaten with Salt and Pepper, but chiefly that &s;ort that cometh from <HI>Cyprus, Tara|gon</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Tarchon, Cabbages, Colliflowers, Turneps, Hor&s;e-raddi&s;hes, Carrots,</HI> of the greater &s;ort of <HI>Fennel, Onions, Garlick,</HI> &amp;c. And al&s;o Fruit, as <HI>Water-melons, Melons, Gourds, Citruls, Melongena, Se&s;amum</HI> (by the Natives cal|led <HI>Sam&s;aim</HI>) the Seeds whereof they are very much u&s;ed to &s;trow upon their Bread, and more; but chiefly the <HI>Coloca&s;ia,</HI> which is very common there, and are &s;old all the Year long: I have al&s;o found them grow wild about Rivu|lets, but could never &s;ee either Flowers or Seeds on them. I found al&s;o without the Gardens many <HI>Dates</HI> and white <HI>Mulberry-Trees,</HI> which ex|ceed our A&s;pen and Nut-Trees in height very much; and al&s;o <HI>Pomgranat-Trees,</HI> and <HI>Siliqua,</HI> which the <HI>Grecians</HI> call <HI>Xylocerata</HI> the <HI>Arabs, Charnubi.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>Olive</HI> and <HI>Almond-Trees,</HI> and <HI>Sebe&s;ten,</HI> the Fruit whereof are to be had at

Apothecaries Shops by the &s;ame Name. <HI>Poma Adami Matth</HI>: But in great plenty there are <HI>Ci|trons, Lemons</HI> and <HI>Oranges,</HI> which are as little eaten there as Pears or Crabs here. Between the&s;e Gardens run &s;everal Roads, and plea&s;ant Walks, chiefly in the Summer, for they afford many &s;hady Places and Greens, where you are defended from the Heat and the Sun-beams: and if pa&s;&s;ing through you &s;hould have a mind to &s;ome of the Fruits, you may either gather &s;ome that are fallen down, or el&s;e pull them from the neare&s;t Trees without danger, and take them home with you.</P>
<P>Without at the Sea-&s;hore, near the Old Town of <HI>Tripoli</HI> (which together with many more, as <HI>Antiochia, Laodicea,</HI> &amp;c. in the Year of our Lord 1183. was &s;o de&s;troyed by an Earthquake, that nothing but a few Marks remain) there were more Spring-gardens, which &s;ome of the Merchants &s;till remember. But the&s;e were a few Years agone by the violence of the Seas &s;o de&s;troyed, and &s;o covered with Sand, that now you &s;ee nothing there but a &s;andy Ground, like unto the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia.</HI> Yet at <HI>Tripoli</HI> they have no want of Water, for &s;everal Rivers flow down from the Mountains, and run partly through the Town; and partly through the Gar|dens, &s;o that they want no Water neither in the Gardens nor in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The New Town in it &s;elf is of no &s;trength, for it is &s;o meanly walled in, that in &s;everal places in the Night you may get in and out: But within there is a Citadel &s;ituated upon an a&s;cent near the Water, where a Garri&s;on of a few Jani&s;aries is kept. They have low Hou&s;es ill built and flat at the top, as they are gene|rally in the Ea&s;t, for they cover their Hou&s;es
<PB N="23" REF="27">
with a flat Roof or a Floor, &s;o that you may walk about as far the Hou&s;es go: And the Neigh|bours walk over the tops of their Hou&s;es to vi|&s;it one another, and &s;ometimes in the Summer they &s;leep on the tops of them: And &s;o it may very well be, that the four Men (of which we read in St. <HI>Mark</HI> the 2<HI>d.</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> the 5<HI>th.</HI> Chapter) that carried the Paralytick Man, and could not come to Chri&s;t becau&s;e of the Crowd of the People, did carry him on the tops of the Hou&s;es, and &s;o let him down through the Roof into the Room where our Saviour was. They have not great Doors, Gates or Com|ings in from the Street as we have in our Country (except &s;ome few Merchants Hou&s;es) becau&s;e they u&s;e neither Wagons nor Carts, wherefore they have only a little low Door, &s;ome|times not above three Foot high, &s;o that you cannot go into them without &s;tooping. In a great many Hou&s;es the Comings in are &s;o dark and deep that one would think he were going into a Cave or Cellar, but when you are come through this Entry into them, you &s;ee in &s;ome great Court-yards wherein are Ci&s;terns to wa&s;h them&s;elves in, in others large Halls paved, and therein &s;ome A&s;cents that go up two or three Steps, paved delicately with Marble, which they keep very clean, and adorned with rich Tape&s;try, whereupon they &s;it, and this is co|vered with a large Arch left open at one &s;ide, that the <HI>Turks</HI> may, chiefly in the Summer, &s;it underneath them very airy.</P>
<P>Their Doors and Hou&s;es are generally &s;hut with wooden Bolts, which are hollow within, and they unlock them with wooden Keys about a Span long, and about the thickne&s;s of a Thumb, into this Key they have driven, five, &s;ix, &s;even,
<PB N="24" REF="28">
eight or nine &s;hort Nails, or &s;trong Wires in &s;uch an order and di&s;tance that they ju&s;t fit others that are within the Lock, and &s;o pull them forwards or &s;hut them backwards as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Streets are but narrow, paved with broad Stones, and have, chiefly tho&s;e that are great Roads, a Channel in the middle of them about ten Inches broad, &s;o that a laden Camel may walk in them with ea&s;e, or that a Man may &s;tep over them, which they &s;ay are made that the laden Camels or A&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that daily ar|rive in great Caravans, may be obliged to walk in them one after another, in good order, that People may walk in the Streets without being di&s;turbed by them. And that the&s;e Channels may be kept clean and dry, they have in &s;ome places &s;ome hidden drains covered with broad Stones, that as well the Rain-water as that of the Wells may run away through them.</P>
<P>They cannot brag of any fine Buildings, &s;ave only the <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> or Temples, into which no <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> mu&s;t come, except he hath a mind to be circumci&s;ed, and &s;o turn a <HI>Mammeluck</HI> or <HI>Renegado</HI>: And al&s;o &s;ome great Hou&s;es by the Natives called <HI>Champ</HI> or <HI>Carvat&s;charas, (Cara|van&s;eries)</HI> wherein are a great many Shops or Ware-hou&s;es, and Chambers by one another, as is in &s;tately Cloi&s;ters, in the middle thereof is a great Court-yard, where the &s;trange Mer|chants (that daily bring their Merchandizes in great <HI>Caravans</HI>) do Inn, con&s;idering that the <HI>Turks</HI> keep no other Inns.</P>
<P>The Inns commonly belong to the <HI>Grand Seignor,</HI> or his <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> which they build in &s;everal Towns to get them&s;elves a yearly Re|venue, as the <HI>Venetians</HI> do in <HI>Venice</HI> out of the <HI>German</HI> Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">Be&s;ides the&s;e Buildings they have al&s;o Hot-Hou&s;es or <HI>Bagnios,</HI> which are &s;o glorious and &s;umptuous, that they far exceed all their other Buildings in Beauty, wherefore they are very well worth &s;eeing. And becau&s;e the <HI>Turks, Moors,</HI> and <HI>Arabs,</HI> &amp;c. according to their <HI>Ma|humetan</HI> Laws are bound to bath them&s;elves of|ten, to wa&s;h them&s;elves clean from their mani|fold Sins which they daily commit, but chiefly when they are going to their <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> therefore they have their Hot-hou&s;es always ready, and keep them warm and in an equal heat, with a very &s;mall Charge, and with far le&s;s Wood then one can imagine, all the Week long, both by Night and by Day. They have under-ground a large and deep Vault, like unto a large Cellar, which is every where very clo&s;e, and it hath no more but two Air holes, one on the top about three or four Inches Diameter, and the other below which is a great deal larger, where they put in Wood, or for want of it pieces of Peat (which they make out of Camels or Goats Dung, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and al&s;o out of the Dregs of the pre&s;&s;ed Grapes) the&s;e are &s;o dry that the great Heat melts them ju&s;t like Sea-coals or Turf, which are burnt in the low Countries, and other places where they have not plenty of Wood: and the&s;e give &s;o great a heat that it warmeth the whole Vault quite through. And yet this Vault is &s;o clo&s;e made that you do not perceive the lea&s;t Smoak nor Vapour, although it is &s;ome|times very hot. But that the Fire may not de|cay, there is one on purpo&s;e to attend it, that flings on as much Fuel as is nece&s;&s;ary to keep it. The&s;e Hot-hou&s;es (which according to the Cu&s;tom of the Ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> are magnificently built) have near to the Entry a
<PB N="26" REF="29">
delicate Hall which is curiou&s;ly paved; (as al&s;o is the whole Bath) and &s;et with Marbles of all colours very artificially, and a great <HI>Cupolo</HI> at the top thereof, which is covered with an Arch in &s;hape of a Ball or Globe. Round about the Walls are broad Benches made, where the Peo|ple put off their Cloaths; wherefore this fir&s;t part of the Bath (whereof the Ancients had five) was called <HI>Apodyterium.</HI> In the middle of the Baths is a fine Fountain, where they &s;prinkle every one that goeth out of the Bath with &s;weet Water, and al&s;o wa&s;h the Bathing-cloaths that were made u&s;e of in the Bath, which they after|wards fling up upon Lines that are hung at the top of the Vault, two or three Fathoms high, with an admirable Certainty, and &s;pread them out with a long-Pole, with one-&s;troke (that they may dry the &s;ooner) &s;o even, as if it were done with Hands, which no body can &s;ee with|out admiration; when they have a mind to make u&s;e of them again, they take them down with the &s;ame Sticks that are ready &s;tuck up about the Fountain. The&s;e are wrought finely with all &s;orts of Colours, whereof they give two to every one that goeth into the Bath or Bagnio, two others when he cometh out, one to put upon his Head, the other to put about him in the manner of an Apron. When you will go into the Hot-hou&s;e you mu&s;t go through two or three Chambers, whereof one is warm|er than the other (which each of them are co|vered with round Arches) until you come into the great Room, the&s;e Arches are full of round holes all about, which are made in &s;uch order, and &s;et with Gla&s;s &s;o curiou&s;ly, that they do not only make them very light, but give al&s;o a fine Ornament to them. In the great Bath are
<PB N="27" REF="29">
&s;everal great Marble Ve&s;&s;els which they let the Water into; round about the great Room, there are three or four &s;mall Chambers, which they keep chiefly for Per&s;ons of Quality, where they may wa&s;h them&s;elves apart from others without any di&s;turbance. Be&s;ides the&s;e there is &s;till another Room where there is a very great Marble Trough, in which every one may wa&s;h him&s;elf after his Sweat; there are &s;everal Pipes laid in it, that you may temper your Water ac|cording to your own de&s;ire. All the&s;e Rooms are heated with the &s;ame Fire, and the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> (which two Nations have almo&s;t the &s;ame Religion and Ceremonies) go into them very frequently; but chiefly the Women, which flock to them in great numbers, for they never meet any where el&s;e, but here, and at the Graves of their Relations; wherefore they keep the&s;e &s;umptuous Buildings (the like whereto are hardly any where el&s;e found) in very good repair. As &s;oon as you come into the Hot-hou&s;e, and are grown a little warm one of the Servants (which are generally black <HI>Moors</HI>) meets you, and lays you backwards down upon the Floor, and &s;tretcheth and &s;naps all your Joints after &s;uch a manner that they crack again; then he kneel|eth down upon your Arms, which he puts up|on your Brea&s;t one over the other, and holds them &s;o for a good while together with his Knees, then he bendeth forwards and &s;tretcheth with both his Hands (keeping you &s;till like a Pri&s;oner under him) your Head upwards. (So it happened once, when &s;ome of us went in together, and were treated by the <HI>Moor</HI> after this manner, that he &s;prained the Neck of one of my Companions, &s;o that he could not turn his Head in &s;everal Days after it) when this is

done he turns you round upon your Belly, toucheth and &s;tretcheth your Joints again in &s;uch a manner, as if he did malax a Plai&s;ter; at length he &s;tands upon your Shoulder-blades and bending him&s;elf down, he rubs you all over your Back with his Hands, then he lifteth you up, and goeth away. Then when you lay your &s;elf down to re&s;t you, or to &s;weat, he maketh a Pa&s;te, to take of your Hair (for they wear no Hair upon their Body, &s;aving only their Arm-pits) he taketh Quick-lime (by the <HI>Arab</HI>'s called <HI>Rils</HI>) and a little <HI>Sarnick, (Ar&s;nick)</HI> that is. Orpiment, powders them, and mix|eth them with Water, and anoints your Hair with it, and looks very often after it, until he finds that the Hair begins to come off, then he wa&s;heth it perfectly off again (before it can hurt you;) when this is done, he takes a fine white Cloth, dips it in Sope-&s;uds, and rubs your whole Body over with it. The before menti|oned Cloaths are white like unto Cotton, but the Threads are harder, which the Pilgrims bring with them from <HI>Meca:</HI> being made of the Bark of Trees that bear <HI>Bdellium,</HI> and they make Ropes of them, as al&s;o of the Fibers of the Leaves of <HI>Palm-Trees,</HI> and of the co|vering of the Fruit of the &s;ame Tree (which is of the bigne&s;s of a Wall-nut) by putting it on a Di&s;taff, and &s;o &s;pinning it out.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They wa&s;h Peoples Heads, and mix &s;ometimes with their Lees (chiefly for Women) an A&s;h-coloured Earth called <HI>Nalun,</HI> which clean|&s;eth the Head, and makes the Hair grow long. They have al&s;o another Earth called <HI>Ju&s;abar,</HI> which the Women eat frequently, &s;o as breed|ing Women in our Country u&s;e to eat &s;ometimes Coals or other things. The&s;e their Baths, are

as free to &s;trangers as <HI>Germans, French</HI> and <HI>Ita|lians,</HI> &amp;c. as to <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> but they mu&s;t have a care not to come into tho&s;e where the Women are, if they will not run the hazard of their Lives. But that you may know where the Women are, they commonly hang a Cloth over the Door towards the Street, that if any Man &s;hould intend to go in there, when he &s;eeth this he may find him&s;elf another entrance.</P>
<P>Further concerning their Traffick, there are in the Town (becau&s;e there is there a very great Depo&s;ition of all &s;orts of Merchandizes, that are brought thither from great di&s;tances) a great many Merchants, chiefly <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> which have two Wi&s;e, Under&s;tanding and Grave Pre&s;idents, of which the one that liveth here is a <HI>French</HI> Man, and the other at <HI>Alepo,</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> called Con&s;uls, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Country|men with good Coun&s;el.

The&s;e Con&s;uls, wear &s;till their u&s;ual Ha|bits, made of Red Satin, Velvet, or Damask, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> very richly adorned, and they bring along with them, Taylors, Shoe-makers, but chiefly their Phy&s;icians, Apothecaries, Barber-Surgeons and Mini&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have be&s;ides them their In|terpreters, skilful in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Language, chiefly the Con&s;ul of <HI>Venice,</HI> becau&s;e he mu&s;t &s;tay there but three Years, when they are expired the <HI>Dogue</HI> &s;ends another in his place.

<PB N="30" REF="31">
not go on &s;hore, before the other gives him a vi&s;it of Reception in the Ship.</P>
<P>To the&s;e two Con&s;uls there are given two large Buildings, called by them <HI>Fondiques,</HI> &s;ituated near two Gates of the City, which lead towards the Haven and the Sea-&s;hore, that they may the ea&s;ier &s;end their Goods in and out. There are all day long a great many <HI>Moors</HI> with their A&s;&s;es, that &s;tand waiting for an opportunity to conduct Merchants and Seamen with their Goods in and out. The&s;e two Hou&s;es are large, and have abundance of Vaults and Chambers, &s;o that there is room enough to lodge both Merchants and their Goods.</P>
<P>With the <HI>French</HI> are al&s;o lodged, tho&s;e from <HI>Genua, Florence, St. Luck, Germans,</HI> and <HI>Dutch|men, &amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o with the <HI>Venetians</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Candia, Corfu,</HI> &amp;c. that are under their Ma&s;ter's Juri&s;diction. The&s;e <HI>Fondiques</HI> have no more then one large Gate, where Jani&s;aries keep watch: when their Ma&s;ters the Con&s;uls go out, they are accompanied with a multitude of Mer|chants and their Servants, and they are in great Authority with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> even be|yond the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> him&s;elf: They always take along with them their Jani&s;aries, which go before with great and long Cudgels, and beat the People out of the way (even the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves.)</P>
<P>The Merchants have daily great Conver&s;ati|on with the <HI>Jews,</HI> for they know a great many Languages, and the Prizes of all Merchandizes, how to buy and to &s;ell them; wherefore they always help to conclude Bargains in Merchan|dizes, pay the Money and give Bills of Ex|change, wherefore they have their Broakage. I have &s;een chiefly three &s;orts of their Silver
<PB N="31" REF="31">
Coins, <HI>viz. A&s;pers, Medin</HI> and <HI>Saiject,</HI> which are very good, and pa&s;s through all <HI>Turky.</HI> When great Sums are paid, they do not tell the whole, but only part of it, and weigh it, and &s;o take the re&s;t proportionably by the &s;ame weight. Of Gold Coins they have only Ducats which are made of fine Gold, and are very limber: be|&s;ides the&s;e you hardly &s;ee any other Coins, but <HI>Venetian Ducats, French Te&s;tons, Joachims Thalers,</HI> of which they have &s;o many, that they often do not only pay with them great Sums and their Bills of Exchange, but turn them al&s;o into their own Coin. So that there is abundance of <HI>Jews</HI> through all <HI>Turky</HI> in any Trading-Town, but chiefly in <HI>Alepo,</HI> and in this Town of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> where they have built a very large Habitation, and a delicate Synagogue. The&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> have the Revenues of Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> in their hands, &s;o that nothing can be brought in or out, but it mu&s;t go through their hands, which is very trouble&s;ome to the Merchants. Tho&s;e that buy any thing of them, mu&s;t have a &s;pecial care, that they be not cheated, for they are full of it, in&s;omuch as they confe&s;s of them&s;elves, that no body can get any thing by them, except he will be a greater <HI>Harmani</HI> (that is cheat) than they, that dare to &s;ell Wall-nuts, for Nutmegs or Myrobolans.</P>
<P>Concerning the Merchandizes: if one will &s;ee &s;everal &s;orts of Goods they are to be found in the <HI>Carvat&s;charas</HI> or <HI>Champen,</HI> whereof I have made mention before, but chiefly in the <HI>Batzaren,</HI> or Hou&s;es where they buy and &s;ell, or Exchanges. The&s;e Exchanges are wide and long, and partly arched, partly covered with Timber, that you may walk and trade there without being wetted, they have Shops on both &s;ides, which are al&s;o
<PB N="32" REF="32">
kept by Handicrafts, Trade&s;men, as Shoe-makers, Taylors, Sadlers, Silk-embroiderers, Turners, Copper-&s;miths, Cutlers, Woollen-drapers, Grocers, Fruiterers, Cooks, and many more, which are very orderly di&s;tributed and placed in their &s;everal Streets and Places. They al&s;o drive a great Trade in Silk, and there are a great many that deal in nothing el&s;e, but Silk, which is convey'd thither from the adja|cent places, for Mount <HI>Libanus</HI> is inhabited by a numberle&s;s People, that live by &s;pinning and working of Silk, but chiefly they of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> where is &s;uch plenty of Silk, that a Merchant may quickly lay out in it many thou&s;and Ducats: Becau&s;e of the great abundance of white Mulberry-Trees (by the Natives called <HI>Tut</HI>) which grow there &s;o high and large, that they have plenty of Leaves to feed their Silk-worms: But the Mulberries thereof are white, and they carry them about in Baskets to &s;ell to ordinary People. So there is in the <HI>Batzars</HI> many Silk-workers, which make all &s;orts of Embroidery, as Pur&s;es, Buttons, and Girdles or Sa&s;hes of &s;everal co|lours, which they tie about their Loins; the&s;e are at work before their Shops, that every one may &s;ee them. When they work, or tie two Threads together, they hold the Work oftener with their great Toe, then pin it to any thing, and the &s;ame do the Turners, (which &s;itting to it) hold their turning Irons as well with their Toes as with their Fingers. Further at a cer|tain time of the Year there is brought from <HI>Da|ma&s;cus</HI> and other adjacent places, to the&s;e <HI>Bat|zars</HI> &s;o great a quantity of large and well-ta&s;ted Cibebs, a kind of Rai&s;ins, having but one or no Stone, that &s;everal Ship loads are &s;ent from thence to us. The&s;e and the like Goods are daily
<PB N="33" REF="32">
brought and found in their <HI>Batzars,</HI> as rare Ta|pe&s;try and delicately wrought Silks with Flow|ers and Ro&s;es of &s;everal colours, &s;ome of which look like pure Gold. But of all the Trades-men there are not &s;o many of one &s;ort as of them that only deal in Soap and Pot-a&s;hes, for of the&s;e A&s;hes (be&s;ides Soap) &s;everal Ship-loads are yearly &s;ent from thence to <HI>Venice,</HI> which they u&s;e for making of Gla&s;e as well as Soap. The&s;e A&s;hes are made chiefly of a Herb called by the <HI>Arabians Schivan,</HI> whereof there are two &s;orts (which among&s;t others I have pa&s;ted upon Paper) one whereof is not unlike to our little <HI>Kali,</HI> it is a thick and knobby Plant, with &s;eve|ral &s;mall Sprigs growing out of it, which have &s;everal full Buttons at the top, and underneath &s;mall pointed Leaves, ju&s;t like the le&s;&s;er <HI>Kali,</HI> as I &s;aid before, ta&s;ting &s;omewhat &s;harp, the Leaves thereof are underneath white, and on the other &s;ide of the colour of A&s;hes. The o|ther &s;ort becometh al&s;o many Stalks, which are full of knots like our Equi&s;etum, and under|neath them appears a Woody and A&s;h-coloured Root.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Herbs grow thereabout in great quantities, and are burnt into A&s;hes upon the high Mountains, in burning thereof there &s;et|tleth an Oily Matter underneath towards the bottom, which united with the A&s;hes is almo&s;t as hard as a Stone when it is cold: at the top thereof a part of the A&s;hes remains unmix'd and loo&s;e, therefore it is not &s;o good as the re&s;t. The&s;e a&s;hes are brought down from the Mountains upon Camels backs by the <HI>Moors,</HI> to &s;ome Merchants that drive a great Trade with them, for partly they &s;end away into Foreign parts, and partly they make Soap of them,
<PB N="34" REF="33">
&s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, according to every one's Capacity and Plea&s;ure. The way they make their Soap in <HI>Syria,</HI> I am informed is this, <HI>viz.</HI> They take commonly Twelve hundred weight (or twelve Centners) of the&s;e A&s;hes, which in the Summer they divide into Eight, and in the Winter into Four parts, becau&s;e the Soap is &s;ooner boil'd up in Winter (for the Heat being then included by the outward Cold is more ve|hement) then in Summer. Of this they take fir&s;t one part and make it into a good &s;harp Lye, which they pour into a very large Kettle or Caldron made of Stone, with a large bottom made of a Copper-plate, and very thick, where|in they have before put Sixteen hundred weight of Sallet-Oil, and let it &s;imper for twenty four Hours, pouring daily in more Lye of another part. But before it is quite boil'd up (which in Winter requireth perhaps five Days, and in Summer nine or ten) they take an Hundred weight of Quick-lime, and mixing it with the A&s;hes, draw a Lye from it, which they put two days before it is quite enough into the Caldron, more or le&s;s according as they find it thick or thin. But if it &s;hould happen, that there &s;hould be too much of the Lye in the Kettle, they have a Cock coming out of the Copper-plate, whereby they let out as much of the Lye as is convenient. When it is almo&s;t boil'd up, they take out, with a Copper-kettle that holds eight or ten Pounds, the thicker part of the Soap that &s;wimmeth on the top, and pour it upon the Floor, which is covered with Lime or Chalk beaten to Powder, let it lie there for one Day in the Winter, and two Days in the Summer, and it grows &s;o hard that they can walk over it, then they make it

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the</HI> Turks <HI>of high and low Conditions, Men and Women: of their Imployments, Offices, Manners, Cu&s;toms, Cloaths, as much as I could at</HI> Tripoli <HI>(during my abode) under&s;tand, &s;ee and learn thereof.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE City of <HI>Tripoli</HI> is, as well as a great many more of the adjacent Towns and Provinces, &s;ubject to the <HI>Turki&s;h Emperor,</HI> wherein he hath his Officers, as in all other places, that they may be ruled according to his Plea&s;ure, and protected from all a&s;&s;aults and dangers. Such Superiors are by them called <HI>Sangiacks</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;haws,</HI> which we may render State-holders, which have &s;everal hundred Hor&s;e-men under their Command, more or le&s;s according to the Revenues of the Provinces that are committed to their care. The&s;e are brave and experienced Souldiers, that lead their Men out into the Fields &s;everal times in the Week, to exerci&s;e them, the Hor&s;e-men in Ri|ding and the Foot in Shooting with Bows and Arrows, which have their &s;everal Marks done upon high Poles to &s;hoot at in their running, that if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion they may be ready to take the Field pre&s;ently to fight their Enemies. The&s;e <HI>Sangiachi</HI> have other Captains and Commanders under them, of which the <HI>Souba&s;haws</HI> or Judges are the Chief, the&s;e are
<PB N="36" REF="34">
placed by him round about in the adjacent places, to officiate for him where he cannot be pre&s;ent. To &s;uch places are commonly called the Burgers or Citizens of the &s;ame places, and they continue no longer then half a Year. By them are examined all Criminal Matters, and they have Power to examine and put to the Tor|ture all Malefactors, to make them confe&s;s their Crimes. They al&s;o accompany the Male|factors that are Sentenced and Condemned by the <HI>Cady</HI> to the place of Execution, to &s;ee the Sentence duly executed: So I have &s;een them often to ride along, but chiefly at one time with a poor Malefactor condemned to die, who was carried on a Camel's back, tied with his Back to a Cro&s;s, with his Arms extended, to the place of Execution, and between the Cro&s;s and his Shoulders were put two burning Torch|es prepared with Bacon, &s;o that the Grea&s;e ran all over his Body, and burnt it &s;everely. The <HI>Turks</HI> have al&s;o for &s;everal Crimes (whereof there are a great many) their &s;everal Puni&s;h|ments, as for Thieves and Murtherers the Gal|lows, for Traytors impaling, and for them that kill a Man Beheading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o they keep a great many Servants, which they &s;end out e|very where, to bring to them any that are &s;u&s;|pected to have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Laws, by beat|ing or wounding one another (which happens very &s;eldom) by Stealing or Murthering, or A|dultery.</P>
<P>For any other Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be&s;ides the&s;e, the <HI>Turks</HI> are brought before other Magi&s;trates, called <HI>Cadi,</HI> which are to under&s;tand the Laws, and to Judge, and to pronounce Sentence after they have examin'd the Witne&s;&s;es. If it be for Debt, they are immediately ca&s;t into Pri&s;on un|til
<PB N="37" REF="34">
they pay, or find out any other means, to make up the Debt. But if it be for tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ing the Laws, they are &s;everely fined, or el&s;e puni&s;hed with blows. Wherefore al&s;o their <HI>Cadi</HI> keep &s;everal Men and Spies, which they daily &s;end out, to find out any, that tran&s;gre&s;|&s;eth the Laws in drinking of Wine, in not go|ing to Prayers frequently, in not &s;trictly ob&s;er|ving their Fa&s;ts, or in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Laws any other ways. If they find any, they &s;um|mon them before their <HI>Cadi,</HI> who puni&s;hes them according to the default, with a pecuniary Mulct, or if they have no Money to give, he Sen|tences them to receive a certain number of Blows upon the Soals of their Feet, and be&s;ides pay half a Penny for each blow. Being that a great many of &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors are daily brought before him, whereof the greate&s;t part receive Blows, it cau&s;eth &s;o mi&s;erable a howling and crying, that we might plainly hear it in the <HI>French Fondique,</HI> which is ju&s;t over again&s;t it: and although the <HI>Cadi</HI> is very much trou|bled with &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, yet Matrimonial Cau&s;es take him up a great deal more time, be|cau&s;e all that will Marry mu&s;t come to him, and make their Agreements and Contracts, which are con&s;igned into his Books, partly that they may have them to &s;hew if any Differences &s;hould ari&s;e between them (&s;eeing that the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> have &s;everal Wives, and are divorced again for a &s;mall matter) and partly that they may give them Copies of their Contracts upon their Marriages, which they write for ordinary People upon &s;mooth and plain Paper, but for others that are rich upon a piece of white Sattin, about a Yard long. The&s;e their Contracts they comprehend in a few Words, and draw them
<PB N="38" REF="35">
up &s;o &s;hort, that they &s;carce contain above eight or ten Lines apiece, at lea&s;t two Inches di&s;tant from one another. For this purpo&s;e they keep &s;everal Clerks, which oftener write upon their Knees then upon Desks or Tables. The&s;e <HI>San|giachs, Souba&s;haws</HI> and <HI>Cadis,</HI> of which I have made mention before, and al&s;o their Wives go very richly cloathed with rich flower'd Silks, artificially made and mix'd of &s;everal colours. But the&s;e Cloaths are commonly given them by tho&s;e that have Cau&s;es depending before them (for they do not love to part with their own Money) to promote their Cau&s;e, and to be favourable to them: for they are &s;o very covetous, that where there is nothing given them, there they do but little, for the <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> and <HI>Sangiachi</HI> (which un|der the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> rule Kingdoms and Prin|cipalities) know very well that they mu&s;t rule but three Years in the &s;ame place: For as &s;oon as their <HI>Sultan</HI> commands them they mu&s;t go to another place, perhaps far di&s;tant from that place. Wherefore they always &s;trive after Ho|nour and Riches, that they may either by Gift or Favour be by the Court promoted, to great|er Authority and Office, or el&s;e if that cannot be obtained, they may at lea&s;t lay up in the mean time &s;uch Riches, that they may be able to maintain them&s;elves after the &s;ame Greatne&s;s, as they did before.</P>
<P>When I lived there, a new <HI>Sangiach</HI> was pro|moted into the place of the old one, who made his entrance followed by his <HI>Spahis,</HI> and was honourably received by the Town: his Train con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t in Hor&s;e, and Archers with Arms and Shields very well &s;tored, they al&s;o had Drums and Kettle-drums, and other Mu&s;i|cal In&s;truments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their Sabers or Scyme|ters
<PB N="39" REF="35">
were for the mo&s;t part tipp'd up a great way with &s;ome gilded Metal, and very &s;mooth and &s;hining, and &s;o were their Stirups, that at a di&s;tance they made a great gli&s;tering.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Officers, love to be look'd upon, as if they performed their Office with great Inte|grity, and yet they are &s;o addicted to Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s (which is the root of all Evil) that, for Gifts or Bribes, they let the fal&s;e Depo&s;itions of tho&s;e that out of Spite accu&s;e the innocent pa&s;s for Good. Therefore it is a very ea&s;ie mat|ter, for any one that would be revenged of his Enemy (by way of a &s;mall pre&s;ent) to bring him into great trouble and co&s;ts. The <HI>Souba|&s;haws</HI> are of the &s;ame Stamp, for they do not at all &s;tick to puni&s;h for Lucre-&s;ake, the Inno|cent, chiefly if they be Rich and Strangers: their Men are very well skill'd in the&s;e Affairs, to find one trifle or other again&s;t them; and be|cau&s;e their time is al&s;o but &s;hort, therefore they make all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to grow rich: and this &s;o much the bolder and opener as they need not to fear their <HI>Sangiach,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> for they wink at it, as being Sharers of the Prey, that receive their Dividend Weekly. In &s;hort, let one have committed never &s;o much Evil, if he giveth but Money to them all is well, and he is as good again as ever he was before. Seeing that many, chiefly in Law Suits, are wrong'd by them, therefore higher Judges (called <HI>Cadile&s;|chier</HI>) are &s;et over them, to puni&s;h them for their Roguery: the&s;e are e&s;teemed by the <HI>Turks</HI> to be the principal Teachers of the Mahume|tan Faith and Laws, they are generally grave and under&s;tanding Men, before whom are brought all intricate Cau&s;es and Appeals to be decided, and they have Power to puni&s;h the&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="36">
and other Officers, but chiefly the <HI>Cadis,</HI> and to put them in and out, according to their be|haviour, wherefore they often take their Cir|cuits from Town to Town, to &s;ee how the <HI>Cadis</HI> execute Ju&s;tice, wherefore they are very much afraid of their coming, and if they know them&s;elves guilty of any Mi&s;demeanors, they oftentimes run away. If they are complained of by the People, they are pre&s;ently puni&s;hed, with many blows, put out of their places, and if the Crime be great, they are after behead|ed, &s;trangled, burnt, or other ways executed, and this happeneth very often in the&s;e Coun|tries. But if one or more, that were al&s;o wronged by the <HI>Cadi,</HI> could not &s;tay till the Arrival of the <HI>Cadile&s;chier,</HI> to make their Complaints to him, they have another way, that is to make their Complaints to the <HI>Port,</HI> or the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>Court,</HI> or el&s;e to go them&s;elves, and make their complaints in Per&s;on, where they are &s;peedily heard (for &s;uch Cau&s;es as I am inform'd are heard certainly once in fifteen days) and right|ed. If any be poor he is maintained by the Court until his Cau&s;e is ended.</P>
<P>Such a Cau&s;e did formerly happen to an In|terpreter of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Con&s;ul, who being very well to pa&s;s, a <HI>Souba&s;haw</HI> did &s;trive to make booty of him: but not being able to prove any thing again&s;t him whereby he could make him puni&s;hable, he found at length a way, and got one of his Servants to hide a common Whore in the Interpreter's Hou&s;e, unknown to him, that he might have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to ac|cu&s;e him. This being done, the Servants of the <HI>Cadi</HI> broke into the Hou&s;e, and &s;earched it, and finding this Whore&punc; they put him into Pri|&s;on. The Interpreter, notwith&s;tanding he plead|ed
<PB N="41" REF="36">
his innocency, and that he was totally ig|norant of the Fact, yet could not &s;atisfie the <HI>Cadi</HI> by any means, but was condemned by him in Nine hundred Ducats, which he was forced to pay. This troubling the Interpreter, he could not brook this unju&s;t Impo&s;ition (being an expe|rienced Man, well skill'd in their Laws) wherefore he took Hor&s;e immediately (unknown to the <HI>Cadi</HI>) for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he made his Complaints to the Court him&s;elf &s;o well, and with that Succe&s;s, that he was declared innocent and not guilty of the Fact. But as this Court u&s;ually doth &s;everely puni&s;h tho&s;e that do com|mit Inju&s;tice, &s;o this <HI>Cadi</HI> did not e&s;cape: for within a little while after the <HI>Turki&s;h Emperor</HI> &s;ent to him a <HI>Chiausba&s;haw</HI> (which may be compared to an Executioner) with a little Note, whereof the Contents were to &s;end him his Head by the Bearer, which frighted the Gentle|man very much, but yet (after by a peculiar Favour he had taken his leave of his Wife) &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to it. This is the Rea&s;on, That many ill Intentions and De&s;igns (chiefly if one &s;ummoned the other to appear at the Court before the Emperor) are &s;topt and drawn back, which el&s;e would have taken effect and been gone on with all.</P>
<P>If a Man appeareth before any <HI>Turk</HI> that is a Per&s;on of Quality, he mu&s;t have e&s;pecial care, that chiefly in departing he do not turn his back-&s;ide towards him, for this is accounted the greate&s;t Incivility and Affront that can be given throughout all the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions. Nay if a Servant appears before his Ma&s;ter to ask him forgivene&s;s of his Faults, he u&s;eth pecu|liar Ceremonies, fir&s;t he &s;ubmitteth him&s;elf, and &s;heweth his Ma&s;ter all re&s;pect imaginable, then
<PB N="42" REF="37">
he taketh with his Knees bended, his Ma&s;ter's Hands to ki&s;s them: if his Ma&s;ter lets him have them freely, he is in good hopes that his Ma&s;ter will grant him his reque&s;t, but if not, but draw|eth them back, although he maketh &s;everal proffers towards them, he knoweth certainly that he is &s;till out of favour, and that there is but &s;mall hopes of obtaining his Intention.</P>
<P>They love that one &s;hould bear a great deal of Honour and Re&s;pect towards them, for they know that their Ma&s;ters the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Power hath for a long time pa&s;t, not been decrea&s;ing but always increa&s;ing; wherefore they take very much upon them&s;elves, and are always richly cloathed, and ride delicate Hor&s;es, well adorn'd with &s;tately Accoutrements, with em|broidered Saddles, and Saddle cloths of Scarlet, Velvet, or other Silks, the Bridles and Stirrups well garni&s;hed with Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>They commonly &s;peak in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lan|guage (and &s;o do all that lie about in Garri&s;ons) which is a very Manly one, and &s;ounds in pro|nouncing much like unto our <HI>German</HI> Tongue: but they al&s;o generally are expert in the <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongue, which is the common one there to the whole Country, and goeth through many Provinces: for you meet there with many <HI>Ara|bians, Syrians, Jacobites,</HI> &amp;c. Chri&s;tians and Heathens to whom this Speech is common.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have al&s;o &s;ome very fine Manners and Cu&s;toms, they are affable, they begin their Di&s;|cour&s;e (chiefly to Relations and Acquaintance) with a friendly Salutation and Ki&s;&s;ing: but they are al&s;o lazy, and do not e&s;teem the liberal Arts and Sciences, love Idlene&s;s better than Labour, for you &s;hall &s;ee them &s;pend a whole Day in the Game of Che&s;&s;e, and other Games, and in

They al&s;o, chiefly in the Summer wear white and wide Cotten Drawers, which reach to their Ancles, and are much narrower below; to them they have no Cod-pieces (which they do not &s;uffer others to wear) that they may wa&s;h them&s;elves without hinderance, their Private parts, Feet, Arms, Necks or any other parts, to clean&s;e them&s;elves as often as their Laws &s;hall direct them.

When they have occa&s;ion to make Water, they untie their Drawers again, &s;it down, and ca&s;t their Cloaths round about them like Women, turn them&s;elves from the South, to which they turn when they are going to pray. If they &s;ee a Man make his water &s;tand|ing, they immediately conclude him to be a Chri&s;tian, and none of their Faith. They com|monly &s;it with their Legs laid one over the o|ther (which they do every where in the Ea&s;t) wherefore they have neither Chair nor Table, but in&s;tead thereof, they have a paved place two or three &s;teps high, which is arched over head, which they keep very clean, and cover it with Tape&s;try, or Serge, or Mats finely twi&s;t|ed with &s;everal colours, according to their A|bility: wherefore to &s;ave them, the <HI>Turks</HI> pull of their Shoes and leave them at the Chamber-door. Their Shoes are like unto tho&s;e our Lacques u&s;e to wear, and like Slippers ea&s;ie to be put on and off, they commonly are of a white or blew colour, painted before, under|neath defended with Nails before, and with Hor&s;e-&s;hoes behind; the&s;e are worn by young and old, Men and Women, rich and poor. Be|&s;ides the&s;e they al&s;o wear &s;ometimes wooden Shoes, which are to be &s;old every where, they are about three Inches high, and in the middle underneath carved out, to di&s;tingui&s;h the Soals from the Heels, painted with &s;everal colours: the &s;ame wear the Women, which have almo&s;t the &s;ame Garments with the Men, and have al|&s;o Drawers, which &s;ometimes are &s;o long that they hang out before their Coats: they are commonly made of fine Cotton of &s;everal co|lours, and laced at the &s;ides. You very &s;eldom &s;ee any <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women either in the Streets or

in the Markets to buy Provi&s;ion, or in their Churches, where only the chiefe&s;t of them come, (and that but &s;eldom) where they have a pe|culiar place &s;eparated from the Men. They have al&s;o in their Hou&s;es &s;ecret places and cor|ners, where they hide them&s;elves immediately, if any body &s;hould come to &s;ee their Hou&s;holds. When they go abroad, which is very &s;eldom, you &s;ee three or four of them together with their Children, which are all one Man's, for according to their Law they are allowed to take as many as they can maintain. Their Faces are all covered with black Vails, whereof &s;ome are of fine Silk, and &s;ome of Hor&s;e-hair, which the poorer &s;ort wear: and over their Head they put &s;ome white Scarfs made of Cotton, which are &s;o broad that they cover not only their Heads but their Arms and Shoulders, they look in them al|mo&s;t like our Maids, when to keep them&s;elves from the Wet, they put a Table-cloth or Sheets over their Heads. But becau&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> are very Jealous, therefore their Wives &s;eldom meet in the Streets or Markets, but only in the Hot-hou&s;es, or when they go to vi&s;it the Tombs of their decea&s;ed Parents or Relations, which generally are out of the Town near the High-ways. When they go thither they take along with them Bread, Chee&s;e, Eggs, and the like to eat there (which was called <HI>Parentalia</HI> by the Latins) ju&s;t as the Heathens u&s;ed to do in former Ages: and &s;ometimes they leave &s;ome of their Chear behind them, that the Bea&s;ts and Birds may eat it after they are gone, for they believe, that &s;uch good be&s;towed upon the Bea&s;ts is as accept|able to God, as if it were be&s;towed on Men. Their Graves are commonly hollow covered at the top with great Stones, which are like unto

Childrens Bed-&s;teads in our Country, which are high at the head and feet, but hollowed in the middle; they fill them up with Earth, wherein they commonly plant fine Herbs, but chiefly Flags, they al&s;o put &s;ome green Myrtles in little Air-holes that are round the Tombs, and they are of opinion that their Relations are the happier the longer the&s;e remain green, and retain their colour, And for the &s;ake of this Super&s;tition, there are in &s;everal places of the Town Myrtles to be &s;old that &s;tand in Water, that they may remain fre&s;h, which the Women buy to &s;tick up at the Graves of their Relations. Their Burying-places are always out of Town near the High-ways, that any body that goeth by may be put in mind of them, and pray to God for them, which is the rea&s;on that &s;o many Chappels are built about their Burying-places, that People that go by (chiefly the Relations of the decea&s;ed) may go into them to pray to God on their behalf. When any of them dieth they wa&s;h him, and put on his be&s;t Cloaths, then they lay him on a Bar or Board, and &s;trow him with Sweet-&s;melling Herbs and Flowers, leaving on|ly his Face bare, that every body may look upon him that knoweth him, as he is carried out. If it be a <HI>T&s;chelebii,</HI> that is a Noble Per|&s;on, they put his Helmet and his other Orna|ments at his Head, his Friends and Acquain|tance, which go before and follow the Corps, keep no order, but hang upon one another, as if they were fudled, and go merrily, and &s;hout|ing along to the Grave: as al&s;o do the Women, who come behind and hollow &s;o loud, that you may hear them a great way off.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A De&s;cription of the Plants I gathered at</HI> Tripoli.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>COn&s;idering that I undertook this Journey into the Ea&s;tern Countries, not only to &s;ee the&s;e People, and to ob&s;erve their Man|ners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but al&s;o, and that principally, dili|gently to enquire, and to &s;earch out the Plants that were growing there. I cannot but &s;hortly de&s;cribe tho&s;e I found about <HI>Tripoli</HI> during my &s;tay there, and will begin with &s;uch as grew on the Sea-&s;hores, which were: <HI>Medica marina, Gnaphalium marinum, Leucoium marinum, Juncus maritimus, Peplis, Scammonium Mon&s;pelien&s;e,</HI> which the Natives call <HI>Meudheuds</HI>; but <HI>Rha&s;is</HI> in his Book <HI>ad Alman&s;.</HI> calleth it <HI>Coriziala, Bra&s;&s;ica marina,</HI> which &s;preads its Roots above the Sand for &s;ome Cubits round, and has in&s;tead of round Leaves rather &s;quare ones. A kind of wild white Lillies by the <HI>Latins</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> cal|led <HI>Hemerocallis,</HI> which did not only grow on the Sea-&s;hore, but al&s;o in I&s;lands thereabout in great plenty; with a great many others, which I forbear to mention here, being common: Be|hind the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, near the Harbour, I found in the Ruines of the old Wall that are left of that City, <HI>Hyo&s;cyamus,</HI> and hard by it in the Sand an Herb not unlike unto <HI>Cantabrica &s;ecunda Caroli Clu&s;ii,</HI> &s;aving only the Stalks and Leaves which are woolly. But the <HI>Ricinus</HI> grow|eth
<PB N="48" REF="40">
there above all in &s;o great plenty, that you can hardly make your way through it, the In|habitants call it &s;till by its old <HI>Arabian</HI> Name <HI>Kerva.</HI></P>
<P>If you turn from thence to the High-way towards your Right-hand, you &s;ee the <HI>Tythimalus Paralius,</HI> and al&s;o a kind of <HI>Conyza Dio&s;c.</HI> out of one Root there &s;pring up &s;everal Stalks, whereof &s;ome grow upright, but the greater part of them lie down upon the ground, and &s;o &s;hoot new Roots, which afterwards &s;prout out into new Stalks: it beareth long Olive-leaves, which are thick, fatti&s;h, and &s;omewhat woolly, and have a &s;trong, and equally &s;weet &s;mell: for the re&s;t, as the Flowers, it is very like unto the great one. You find there al&s;o the le&s;&s;er and greater <HI>Medica,</HI> which the <HI>Moors</HI> to this day &s;till call <HI>Fa&s;a.</HI> Likewi&s;e &s;o great and many <HI>Squills,</HI> that the Inhabitants weed them up, chiefly tho&s;e that grow near their Gardens, and fling them up in high heaps like Stones. There al&s;o groweth <HI>Securidaca minor, Tribulus terre&s;tris,</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Ha&s;eck,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Echium,</HI> which groweth by the way as you go to St. <HI>Jame</HI>'s Church, which from thence is &s;i|tuated upon an a&s;cent at a Mile's di&s;tance. Hereabout, and in other adjacent places, groweth a great quantity of Sugar-canes, &s;o that there is year|ly &s;old a great many Sugar-loaves that are made thereof. The&s;e are as high and big as our Canes, and not much differing from them, but within, and down towards the Root, where they are be&s;t, they are full of this plea&s;ant Juice, where|fore the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> buy a great many of them, being very plea&s;ant to them to chew and eat, for they are mightily plea&s;ed with Sweet-meats (whereof they have variety.) Before
<PB N="49" REF="40">
they begin to eat or chew them, they &s;tript off the long Leaves and cut away what is ta&s;tele&s;s, &s;o that only the juicy and good remaineth, which is hardly two Foot. Of the thus pre|pared Canes they carry many along with them through the Streets, and cut off one piece after another, skale them, and &s;o chew and eat them openly every where in the Street without &s;hame; for they are, principally near the Root, very tender and feel as mellow between your Teeth as if it were Sugar it &s;elf. So the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e them&s;elves to Gluttony, and are no more &s;o free and couragious to go again&s;t their Ene|mies to fight as they have been in former Ages. The Sugar Canes do not grow there from Seeds, neither are they propagated by the Root, but by the Canes them&s;elves, whereof they lay in|to the Ground, &s;ome green pieces of two or three Joints long, and that they may grow the &s;ooner, they bore prety large holes in between the Joints; when they begin to grow they &s;prout out in the Joints, and grow up into great Canes, and &s;o bring in good profit.</P>
<P>There al&s;o by the Rivers are found <HI>Anthillis marina, Vi&s;naga,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Apocymum,</HI> and <HI>Olean|der</HI> with Purple Flowers, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Defle,</HI> and a delicate kind of <HI>Scabio&s;a Me|li&s;ra Maluca,</HI> and if you go to the Gar|dens, you &s;ee <HI>Heliotropium majus, Convolvulus folio acuto, Vitis nigra, Pha&s;eolus Turcicus,</HI> with yellow Flowers, which &s;till retain the ancient Name of <HI>Lubie, Ly&s;imachia lutea,</HI> and wild Vines called <HI>Labru&s;cae,</HI> whereon nothing grow|eth but only the Flowers called <HI>Ocnanthe</HI>: and al&s;o a Shrub like unto the <HI>Polygonus of Carol Clu&s;ius</HI>; which climbs up into high Trees, and hang down again from the Twigs,
<PB N="50" REF="41">
and I very believe they are the &s;ame with <HI>Ephedra,</HI> whereof <HI>Pliny</HI> maketh mention in the 7<HI>th</HI> Chapter of his 26<HI>th</HI> Book.</P>
<P>When I went farther, with an intention to con&s;ider the Plants that grew in the Country, fir&s;t came before me &s;ome <HI>Sycomors,</HI> whereof chiefly <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> and <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> make menti|on, and tell us of two &s;orts, and when I called the&s;e things to mind, I light of one of the &s;e|cond &s;ort of <HI>Sycomors,</HI> whereof abundance grow in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> wherefore the&s;e wild Figg-Trees might be called the one the <HI>Cypri&s;h Sycomore</HI>-Tree, and the other the <HI>Aegyptian Sycomore</HI>-Tree, according to the places where they are mo&s;t frequent and fruitful. I found a great many of them, the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> call them <HI>Mumeitz,</HI> they are as great and as high as the white <HI>Mulberry</HI>-Trees, and have almo&s;t the &s;ame Leaves, but they are only &s;omewhat rounder, and are al&s;o whole at or about the &s;ides, they bear Fruit not unlike to our Figg-Trees, only they are &s;weeter, and have no little Seeds within, and are not &s;o good, wherefore they are not e&s;teemed, and are commonly &s;old only to the poorer &s;ort of People, they grow in all Fields and Grounds, as you may &s;ee by the Words of the &s;econd Book of the <HI>Chronicles</HI> in the 9<HI>th.</HI> Chap. Ver&s;. 27<HI>th. And the King made Silver in Jeru&s;alem as Stones, and Cedar-Trees made he as the Sycomore-Trees that are in the low Plains in abundance. Zacheus</HI> did climb upon &s;uch a one when he had a great mind to &s;ee our Saviour, <HI>E&s;&s;aias</HI> al&s;o maketh mention of them in his 9<HI>th. Chap. Ver&s;.</HI> 10. and <HI>Amos</HI> in his 7<HI>th. Chap. Ver&s;.</HI> 14. where he &s;aith of him&s;elf: <HI>I was a Herds-man, and a Gatherer of Sycomore-Fruit.</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="41">
The&s;e two &s;orts are very like one ano|ther, in Stem, Leaves, and Fruit, only as the Fruit of the one comes more out of the great Stem and great Twigs, &s;o that of the other does the &s;ame, but not out of the Stems and Twigs immediately, but out of Twigs or Sprouts with|out Leaves of the length of five or &s;ix Inches, whereon they grow &s;ometimes very thick, and in a bunch together. The&s;e Trees bear Fruit three or four times yearly, which are &s;mall, of an A&s;h colour, oblong round, like Prunes, and are found upon the Trees almo&s;t all the Year long. Hereabout al&s;o grow many Thorns, whereof is made mention in the Scriptures, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Hau&s;eit,</HI> and by the <HI>Ara|bians Hau&s;egi,</HI> but the <HI>Latins</HI> call them <HI>Ahamnus,</HI> and al&s;o white Poplars, &s;till to this day called <HI>Haur</HI> by the <HI>Arabians.</HI> There al&s;o groweth a great and high Tree which beareth delicate Leaves and Flowers plea&s;ant to look upon (by the Inhabitants called <HI>Zen&s;etacht,</HI> but by <HI>Rhazes</HI> and <HI>Avicenna, A&s;tirgar, &amp; A&s;tergir,</HI> and <HI>Azada|racht</HI>) whereof you &s;ee here and there &s;everal planted in the Streets, to make a plea&s;ant Shade in the Summer, the Fruit thereof remaineth upon them all the Year long, until they put out again a new, for they are hurtful, and kill the Dogs if they eat thereof.</P>
<P>Near the Town upon the Highlands (where you &s;ee abundance of Corn-fields, and abun|dance of plea&s;ant Olive-Trees, that reach quite up to Mount <HI>Libanus</HI>) are found <HI>Polium monta|num, Pecten veneris, ferrum equinum, Chamaeleon niger,</HI> with its &s;harp pointed and black Roots and Leaves, very like unto the Leaves of <HI>Car|lina,</HI> whereof the Stalks are of a reddi&s;h co|lour, a Span long, and of the thickne&s;s of a
<PB N="52" REF="42">
Finger: whereon are &s;mall prickly Heads, of a blewi&s;h colour, not unlike to the&s;e of the little <HI>Eryngium.</HI> Another fine Plant grows therea|bout, called <HI>Sathar</HI> in their Language, but when I con&s;ider its beautiful Purple-coloured Flow|ers, and its &s;mall Leaves which are &s;omething long withall, I rather judge it to be the <HI>Ha&s;ce</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> or the true <HI>Thyme</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> which we call <HI>Serpillum Romanum.</HI> It hath &s;o plea&s;ant an Acrimony, as any Spice can have, wherefore the Inhabitants u&s;e it very much, whole or in pouder, at home and abroad, with and without their Meat, chiefly for to correct an ill dige&s;tion of their Stomach. This Herb is never found in our Apothecaries Shops, they take another in its room, which hath le&s;&s;er and greener Heads, and is rather the fir&s;t <HI>Satureia</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> brought from <HI>Candia.</HI> There are al&s;o two &s;orts of <HI>Clinopodium,</HI> whereof the le&s;&s;er and tenderer (con&s;idering its long Stalks, Leaves and Flowers, which grow in good order, and at equal di&s;tances one over the other) may very well be taken for the true one of the <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> There are al&s;o <HI>Ilex minor, Sabina baccifera, Tere|binthus</HI> and many more.</P>
<P>In the Town are found &s;everal &s;trange Plants, one called <HI>Mu&s;a,</HI> whereof the Stalks are from nine to twelve Foot high, which are &s;mooth, and without (they are inclo&s;ed in their Leaves, and often quite &s;urrounded like our Reeds) of a fine &s;hining Green; at the top thereof the Leaves &s;pread them&s;elves out, and look like a great bu&s;h of Feathers, for they are very long, and &s;o broad that the bigge&s;t Per&s;on may lie upon them with his whole Body very well. The&s;e Leaves have a rib in the middle, which keepeth them up &s;treight, and &s;o &s;trongly, that
<PB N="53" REF="42">
although the Wind breaketh them at the &s;ides in &s;everal places, yet notwith&s;tanding they re|main upright. The&s;e Trees bear their Fruit no more but once, wherefore they are cut down, and &s;o the Root &s;hoots out &s;everal other Stalks about a Foot di&s;tant from the old one, which grow up again, and bring forth Fruit, which groweth on a thick Stalk in great num|bers; they are almo&s;t &s;haped like the <HI>Citruls,</HI> round and bended, only they are le&s;s, &s;mooth without, environed with a thick rind, which is fir&s;t yellow, but when they are kept a few days it grows black, it is ea&s;ily &s;eparated when they are new, within they are whiti&s;h, full of Seeds; &s;weet and good to eat; but they fill mightily, and are apt to gripe: wherefore (as <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> mentioneth in the 5th. Chapter of his 4th. Book) <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, forbid his Army to eat them, when he went into the <HI>Indies.</HI> There groweth but very little of this Fruit about <HI>Tripoli,</HI> but it is brought from the Neigh|bouring places plentifully. We al&s;o find there another Tree, not unlike unto our <HI>Privett,</HI> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Alcanna,</HI> or <HI>Henne,</HI> and by the <HI>Grecians</HI> in their vulgar Tongue <HI>Schenna,</HI> which they have from <HI>Egypt,</HI> where (but above all in <HI>Cayro</HI>) they grow in abundance. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> nur&s;e the&s;e up with great care and diligence, becau&s;e of their &s;weet-&s;melling Flowers, and put them into earthen Pots, or wooden Ca&s;es or Boxes, to keep them in the Winter in Vaults from the Fro&s;t, which they cannot endure. And becau&s;e they hardly be|gin to &s;prout before <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they water them with Soap&s;uds, but others lay Lime about the Root, to make it put forth the earlier, that it may flower the &s;ooner, becau&s;e of the plea|&s;antne&s;s
<PB N="54" REF="43">
of the Smell of the Flowers, which is &s;omewhat like Musk: They are of a pale yel|low colour, and &s;tand in Spikes of the length of a Span, but not very clo&s;e, &s;o that Leaves appear between them; Their Twigs are al&s;o of the &s;ame colour, whereof many &s;ent to us, to clean&s;e the Teeth with them, as it were with a Bru&s;h, when they are brui&s;ed a little at the ends. They al&s;o (as I am informed) keep their Leaves all Winter, which Leaves they pow|der and mix with the Juice of Citrons, and &s;tain therewith, again&s;t great Holydays, their Hair and Nails of their Children of a red co|lour. Which colour perhaps may be &s;een with us on the Mains and Tails of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;es. The Powder is greeni&s;h, and &s;o common with them, that you &s;ee in their <HI>Batzars</HI> whole Bags full thereof &s;tanding before their Shops, which come from <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> from whence whole Ship-loads are &s;ent through <HI>Turky,</HI> as I have &s;een my &s;elf in this Harbour &s;everal, from whence the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor hath yearly a great Revenue. The <HI>Arabians</HI> burn their <HI>Spodium</HI> out of the Root thereof, as <HI>Avicen</HI> remarks in his 17<HI>th.</HI> Chapter. This being thus, it appeareth that there is no &s;mall difference between the&s;e two, ours and theirs, I am of opinion, that theirs (which is mentioned in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Song</HI>) is liker to that which <HI>Dio&s;cor.</HI> de&s;cribeth, then our <HI>Ligu&s;trum.</HI></P>
<P>Thereabout is al&s;o found within and without the Gardens a peculiar &s;ort of Mallows, by them called <HI>Chethince,</HI> which is very large, and high, and like other Trees, &s;preads its woody Twigs and &s;oft Boughs, that are covered with a browni&s;h Bark; among&s;t the re&s;t I &s;aw one as big as a Man's middle, the Leaves thereof
<PB N="55" REF="43">
are of a dark Green, long, and at the &s;ides to|wards the point crenated, its Flowers are ra|ther bigger than other Mallows, of a blew co|lour, their Seeds I did never &s;ee. Hard by I found another Outlandi&s;h <HI>Do&s;chet</HI> Flower, which was almo&s;t decay'd, &s;o that it had neither Leaves, Flowers nor Seeds: It was about three Foot high, the Stem and Twigs were hairy, hollow within as other Stalks, of a green co|lour inclining &s;omewhat to yellow, which had at top many other &s;hoots, each of them had behind like unto other Tree-&s;tems its proper Joint. This is &s;o juicy quite through, that it drops almo&s;t with Milk, which is &s;harper than any Spurge. I made great inquiry of them about it, but could have no certain accompt thereof, but as it &s;eemed to me, it is very like unto <HI>Xabra</HI> and <HI>Camarronus</HI> of <HI>Rhazes</HI> by the <HI>Ara|bians</HI> called <HI>Tanaghut</HI> and <HI>Sabeam,</HI> and may be ta|ken according to that Author's de&s;cription for it.</P>
<P>Further hereabout, chiefly in the Town up|on the Ci&s;terns and Conduits I found <HI>Adian|tum,</HI> by the Apothecaries called <HI>Capillus Veneris,</HI> and in old Walls the <HI>Apollinaris.</HI> I al&s;o found in the Shops in their <HI>Batzare</HI> two &s;orts of Roots, whereof one was rounder, which may be the <HI>Bulcigeni</HI> of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> which are called <HI>Thra&s;i</HI> at <HI>Verona,</HI> where they g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w (as the learn|ed <HI>Malthiolus</HI> te&s;tifieth) many of the&s;e are &s;ent out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> to <HI>Tripoli,</HI> and &s;old there, chiefly to eat in <HI>June,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Habel, A&s;&s;is</HI> and <HI>Altzis,</HI> this being true, and they being very like both in Name and Quality to the Grains of <HI>Altzelem</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> they mu&s;t be the &s;ame, although <HI>Rhazis</HI> reckoneth the&s;e a|mong&s;t the Fruits.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Which way I travelled from</HI> Tripolis <HI>further to the two Famous Cities of</HI> Damant <HI>and</HI> Halepo.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter I had re&s;ted for &s;everal Weeks in <HI>Tri|polis,</HI> and had ob&s;erved that City, its Building, and plea&s;ant Situation, and moreover the Manners, Cu&s;toms, and Habits, as well of the low as high ones, I propounded to my &s;elf to Travel to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> which is almo&s;t the bigge&s;t, and the mo&s;t Famous, Trading City of <HI>Syria,</HI> which lies five or &s;ix days Journey towards the North-ea&s;t of <HI>Tripolis.</HI> And when I met with &s;ome Companions to Travel with me, we &s;to|red our &s;elves with Provi&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> Bread, Chee&s;e, Eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for our Journey, and &s;o &s;et out of <HI>Tripolis</HI> the 9<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>November, Anno</HI> 73.</P>
<P>By the way we met with a great deal of Rain, which commonly begins at that time of the Year, and continueth almo&s;t all the Winter long: This kept us &s;o much back, that we reach|ed not to <HI>Damant,</HI> which is in the mid-way from <HI>Tripolis</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> before the fourth day. There we lodged in one of their great <HI>Champs,</HI> called <HI>Carvat&s;charas,</HI> where we had a Chamber a&s;&s;igned us, in which we found neither Table, nor Chairs, nor Bench, nor Bed, only upon the Floor was laid a <HI>Stromatzo</HI> twi&s;ted, of Canes, which was to &s;erve us in&s;tead of them all. There we bought in their <HI>Bazar</HI> &s;ome Victuals according to our
<PB N="58" REF="45">
plea&s;ure, and &s;taid there all Night long. The Town, which &s;ome take to be the Old <HI>Apamia,</HI> is pretty big, and pretty well built; it lies in a Valley between Hills, &s;o that you can &s;ee no|thing of it (the Ca&s;tle only excepted, which lyeth on the Hill, and guardeth it very well) before you are ju&s;t come to it. Round about it there is many Orchards and Kitchen-Gardens, which they Water out of the River <HI>Ha&s;ce,</HI> which is pretty large, and runs through the Town. The Water they lift up with Wheels for that purpo&s;e fixed in the River, that pour it into Channels that carry it into the Gardens, and &s;o Water them in the great heat of the Sun, to refre&s;h them. The&s;e Gardens had been worth my &s;eeing, but my Fellow-Travellers were in ha&s;t, and &s;o we put on the next Morning for <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>By the way we &s;aw very good Corn-Fields, Vineyards, and Fields planted with Cotton, which is brought from thence, and &s;old to us under the Name of the place where it grew, and al&s;o Silks and other Goods that are bought there at the fir&s;t hand. In the&s;e Countries are a great many Wild A&s;&s;es called <HI>Onagri,</HI> the Skins of them are very &s;trong to wear, and as they prepare them, finely frockt on the out|&s;ide, as Strawberries are, or like the Skin of the <HI>Sepia,</HI> or Cuttle-Fi&s;h, wherefore they commonly make their Scabbards for their Scymitars, and Sheaths of their Knives thereof. Their Blades are watered on both &s;ides very &s;ubtilly; they are made of good Metal, well hardened, and &s;o &s;harp (chiefly the&s;e that are made in <HI>Dama&s;|cus</HI>) that you may cut with them a very &s;trong Nail in pieces, without any hurt to the Blade. They wear rather Knives than Daggers, which
<PB N="59" REF="45">
they tye to their Girdles with finely wrought Tapes, by their backs.</P>
<P>When we went on and came to the Pro|montory of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> we &s;aw abundance of Villages by the way, which for the mo&s;t part are inhabited by Chri&s;tians, <HI>viz. Syrians, Maronites, &amp;c.</HI> with whom we did Lodge &s;ome|times over-night; the&s;e entertained us very ci|villy, and gave us &s;uch Wine to drink, as grew on the Mountains, than which I hardly remem|ber I ever drank better. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the Villages we came to one called <HI>Hanal,</HI> ly|ing high in a Fruitful Country, where, as I am informed, in former days a very fine City &s;tood, which is &s;o de&s;olated, and in proce&s;s of time decayed to that degree, that in our days there is almo&s;t nothing of it left but a &s;mall Village, and here and there in the Fields &s;ome &s;mall Ruins of Old Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>We went on further between the Mountains, where we &s;pied a little Town upon the Hills, and above it a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which it's &s;aid the <HI>French</HI> did formerly build, that lyeth in a very convenient place between the Mountains, &s;o that you mu&s;t go ju&s;t by it; but becau&s;e it is haunted with Evil Spirits and Hobgoblins, it re|maineth unrepaired, and uninhabited. We left it on our left hand, and came out into a &s;paci|ous Corn-Field well tilled, where on our left we &s;aw the Town <HI>Sermin</HI> at a great di&s;tance, and near to it and about it, great Woods of <HI>Pi&s;tacio</HI>-Trees, which are gathered there, and &s;ent to <HI>Tri|polis,</HI> and &s;o by the Merchants to us: Some of them grow al&s;o near the High-ways, chiefly in the Village of <HI>Ba&s;ilo,</HI> where we &s;tayed all Night.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="46">In our way we found nine or ten <HI>Champs</HI> cal|led <HI>Caravat&s;charas,</HI> the&s;e are open Inns, where the <HI>Caravans</HI> and Travellers go in, commonly towards Evening, to &s;tay there all Night; they are free to any body, but you find neither Meat nor Drink there, if you will have it you mu&s;t bring it along with you, and mu&s;t be contented to lye upon Straw (if you can have it) upon the lower Wall, which goes round about the &s;ides, on purpo&s;e to give to Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and Camels their Food upon it. They are general|ly three Miles di&s;tant from one another; they are large and &s;tately, and as &s;trong in Walls as Ca&s;tles, commonly built four-&s;quare, and have within a large Yard, and round about it are Stables which are quite open, ju&s;t like Cloi&s;ters.

<P>When we had travelled over &s;everal rough Mountains, and came almo&s;t near to <HI>Halepo,</HI> we &s;aw at la&s;t the City ju&s;t like <HI>Damand,</HI> of the bigne&s;s of <HI>Strasbourg</HI>; at the Gates we di&s;|mounted, becau&s;e in <HI>Turky</HI> no Outlandi&s;h Man hath liberty to Ride through a City; and &s;o we went into it, and I went into the <HI>French Fundique</HI> to take my Lodgings, as all <HI>Germans</HI> u&s;e to do.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Situation of the Potent City of</HI> Ha|lepo, <HI>of the Buildings thereof, and al&s;o of the delicate Fruits, and fine Plants, that grow there within and without Gar|dens,</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Town of <HI>Halepo</HI> (which is the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t Potent in <HI>Syria,</HI> anciently called <HI>Nerea</HI>) is in &s;ome places well Fortified with Ditches and Walls, only they are not quite round it, &s;o that one may (the &s;ame it is with <HI>Tripolis</HI>) at any time of Night go in and out: Neither are the Gates, as u&s;ed in our Country, chiefly in Cities of Account, be&s;et with Soul|diers, but you will only &s;ee two or three wait|ing at the Head-Gates, where the High-ways go through, which are rather there to take Cu&s;tom, than to keep the Gates, neither have they any Arms. But in the middle of the City there is a Ca&s;tle on a high Hill, which is &s;trong, large, &s;urrounded with Walls and Ditches, and well be&s;et with a good Guard. Concerning their other Buildings (which are flat at the top, and covered with a &s;ort of Pavement, that one may walk on the tops of them) they are like unto them of <HI>Tripolis.</HI> Among&s;t the re&s;t there is a very Magnificent Building, which they &s;ay hath co&s;t a great deal of Money, which hath for its Entrance a very low and &s;mall Door, &s;o that one mu&s;t bend him&s;elf very low that will
<PB N="62" REF="47">
go into it, but when you come in, you find there delicate large Halls, high open Arches, (very plea&s;ant and cool to &s;it underneath in the Sum|mer) Water-works, Orchards, and Kitchen-Gardens, where among the re&s;t was one of the&s;e <HI>Ketmy's:</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e there was al&s;o &s;ome fine Mo&s;ques with Steeples, which were round and &s;mall, but very high; &s;ome of them had a Balcony at the top, like unto a Garland, where|upon the Waits are, and their Prie&s;ts go about at the time of Prayers, to call People in. But for other &s;tately Buildings, that might be ere|cted for the Memory of &s;ome Potent King or Prince, there is none.</P>
<P>Without the City they have here and there &s;ome Country-Hou&s;es, among the re&s;t one built for the <HI>Turki&s;h Emperour,</HI> at four Miles di&s;tance from the City, where he u&s;ed to be &s;ometimes, chiefly when he is at War with the <HI>Sophy,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that he may pre&s;ently a&s;&s;i&s;t his Army, in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity: This is very large, but not built &s;o &s;tately as &s;o great a Monarch de|&s;erveth. In the great Garden is a Chappel built by the River that runs through it, upon Pillars, where the <HI>Great Sultan</HI> u&s;ed to hold Conferences with his Privy-Councellors and Vi&s;ier-Ba&s;haws. It happened in the Reign of <HI>Solyman the Great,</HI> (as the Gardiner did relate to us) that when they were a&s;&s;embled, to con&s;ult whether it was more profitable to him, to &s;uffer the <HI>Jews</HI> in his Provinces, or to root them quite out: After every one had given his Opinion, and the mo&s;t of them were of the Opinion, that they ought not to be tolerated, becau&s;e of their in&s;ufferable U&s;ury, wherewith they oppre&s;&s;ed his Subjects: And after the Emperour had heard every ones Sentiment, he gave them al&s;o to under&s;tand his,
<PB N="63" REF="47">
and that in this in&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> He bad them look upon a Flower-Pot, that held a quantity of fine Flowers of divers colours, that was then in the Room, and bid them con&s;ider whether each of them in their colour, did not &s;et out the other the better; and that if any of them &s;hould decay, or be taken away, whether it would not &s;omewhat &s;poil the Beauty of the re&s;t. After every one had heard the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Opinion, and did allow of it to be true; the Emperour did begin to explain this, and &s;aid, The more &s;orts of Nations I have in my Do|minions under me, as <HI>Turks, Moors, Grecians, &amp;c.</HI> the greater Authority they bring to my King|doms, and make them more famous. And that nothing may fall off from my Greatne&s;s, I think it convenient, that all that have been together &s;o long hitherto, may be kept and tolerated &s;o &s;till for the future; which plea&s;ed his Council &s;o well, that they all unanimou&s;ly agreed to it, and &s;o let it remain as it was. Without the City of <HI>Halepo,</HI> are abundance of Quarries, where they dig great Free-&s;tones of a va&s;t big|ne&s;s, almo&s;t as white and &s;oft as Chalk, very proper for Building: There are al&s;o about the Town &s;ome Walks or Grotto's under Ground, which are above an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile long, which have the Light let into them by holes made near the High-way, &s;o that a Man mu&s;t be ve|ry careful, (chiefly at Night) that he may not fall into them, or that he may not be trapan'd by the <HI>Moors</HI> that live in them in great numbers. The Ground about it being very Chalky, it cau&s;eth to the &s;oles of our Feet, chiefly at Night, although one be very well provided with &s;trong &s;hooes, a very con&s;iderable dryne&s;s and heat, as one may al&s;o &s;ee by the <HI>Moors,</HI> that, for the mo&s;t part, go bare-foot, which cau&s;eth the &s;oles
<PB N="64" REF="48">
of their Feet to be &s;o &s;hrifled, that into &s;ome of their crevi&s;es you may almo&s;t put your little Finger. Yet notwith&s;tanding that, <HI>Halepo</HI> is &s;ur|rounded with Rocky Hills, and the Valleys thereof are Chalky; they have no want of Corn, as Barley, Wheat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but rather it is very Fruitful, and their Harve&s;t beginneth com|monly in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May:</HI> But they have but few Oats, and le&s;s Gra&s;s or Hay; for the dryne&s;s is &s;o great, and it is &s;o Sandy, and the Hills are &s;o rough and full of Bu&s;hes, that they make but very little Hay. Wherefore they feed their Cattel with Barley, and with Straw, which is broken in pieces by thre&s;hing Waggons, that are drawn by Oxen. The Valley is al&s;o full of Olive-Trees, &s;o that Yearly they make &s;e|veral Thou&s;and Hundred Weight of Oyl for to make Soap. There is al&s;o a great quantity of Tame and Wild Almond-Trees, of Figgs, of Quince, and white Mulberry-Trees, which are very high and big: <HI>Pi&s;tacies</HI>-Trees, which they call <HI>Fi&s;tuc,</HI> are hereabout very common; they have underneath very &s;trong &s;tems, which have outwardly an A&s;hen-colour'd Bark, and are a|dorned with hand&s;ome Leaves of a &s;ad green colour, like unto their <HI>Charnubis,</HI> and behind them grow many &s;mall Nuts like Grapes in Clu&s;ters together. In the Spring when they fir&s;t put out, they &s;end forth long &s;hoots, which the <HI>Moors</HI> gather in great quantity for their Sallad, and dre&s;s them as we do A&s;paragus. There are al&s;o abundance of delicate Orchards, that are filled with <HI>Oranges, Citrons, Lemons, Adams-Apples, Sebe&s;ten, Peaches, Morelloes,</HI> and <HI>Pomgra|nats,</HI> &amp;c. and among&s;t them you find &s;ometimes Apples and Pears, but very few, nor &s;o many &s;orts, nor &s;o big, nor &s;o well coloured as ours.
<PB N="65" REF="48">
There grow many Mirtles, which bear roundi&s;h Berries of the bigne&s;s of our <HI>Sorbus</HI> or Services, of a blewi&s;h Grey colour, very good to eat, which have white Seeds of the &s;hape of our jumping Chee&s;e-magots, they propagate them diligently, becau&s;e they are beautiful, and re|main long green, to put about their Graves. More|over there are many <HI>Sumach</HI>-Trees, which they plant for their Seeds &s;ake, which is much u&s;ed by them: But <HI>Cherries, Amelanchier</HI> and <HI>Spenleny</HI> I have not &s;een there, and very few Goo&s;eber|ries, or Currans: <HI>Weych&s;eln</HI> they have, but very few, wherefore they e&s;teem them, and keep them choice, as a Foreign Plant, to &s;hew them to others, and to pre&s;ent great Per&s;ons with them. This may &s;uffice of Trees. Concern|ing their Garden Plants, tho&s;e that are com|mon, are Endives, Lettice, Kel or Coleworts, Colliflowers, <HI>Caulorapa Rauckelen Apium, Tar|con</HI> whereof <HI>Rha&s;es</HI> de&s;cribeth two &s;orts, one with long &s;mall Leaves, by us called Taragon, and the other with broad Leaves, which I reckon to be our <HI>Lepidium,</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Cozirihan. Ravos Serap:</HI> or our Hartichokes. But beyond all they plant <HI>Coloca&s;ia</HI> in &s;uch plenty, as we do Turneps, whereof they have al&s;o great plenty. They are al&s;o very well pro|vided with Hor&s;e-raddi&s;hes, Garlick and Oni|ons, which the Inhabitants &s;till call <HI>Ba&s;&s;al.</HI> Of <HI>Pumpions, Citruls,</HI> and <HI>Cucumis anguinus</HI> (which they call <HI>Gette</HI>) they plant as many as they have occa&s;ion for; but many more <HI>Angurien</HI> an <HI>In|dian Muskmillion,</HI> (Water-mellons) which they call <HI>Batiechas,</HI> but <HI>Serap. Dullaha,</HI> they are large, of greeni&s;h colour, &s;weet and plea&s;ant to eat, and very cooling, wherefore they e&s;teem them to be their be&s;t Fruits: but chiefly tho&s;e, which
<PB N="66" REF="49">
have more red than white within, they are very innocent and harmle&s;s, and keep &s;o long good, that they &s;ell them in their <HI>Batzars</HI> all the Winter long. Moreover, there are three &s;orts of tho&s;e Plants which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Me|lanzana, Melongena,</HI> and <HI>Beudengian,</HI> as A&s;h co|loured, Yellow and Fle&s;h coloured, which are very like one another in their Crook|edne&s;s and Length, and like unto the long Gourds. There are two other &s;orts, which are called <HI>Bathle&s;chain, viz.</HI> oblong and round ones, which are much bigger, of a black colour, and &s;o &s;mooth and glazed, that they give a Reflection. They eat the&s;e oftener, boiled (chiefly after the way which <HI>Averrh&ouml;es</HI> mentioned) than raw. Without their Gardens are two o|ther &s;trange Plants, which al&s;o (being they eat them commonly with others) may be reckon|ed among the Kitchin-Herbs: whereof one is called by them <HI>Secacul,</HI> which I found about the Town in &s;hady places, and among Trees, and in the Corn, its Roots are of an A&s;hen co|lour without, and white within, &s;mooth, mel|low, or tender, of one Inch thick, and one and a half long, it hath in&s;tead of Fibers, little knobs like unto Warts, and a &s;weet ta&s;te, not unlike to our Carrots in Stalk, Herb or Head, &s;aving only the Flowers which are yellow; the Herb-women carry them &s;trung upon Strings about the Streets to &s;ell them. The other &s;ort is al&s;o very plentiful, and is found in dry and rough places, which the Inhabitants to this day with <HI>Serapio</HI> called <HI>Hacub,</HI> whereof he maketh mention in his 295 Chapter, under the Name of <HI>Hacub Alcardeg,</HI> whereof they cut in the Spring, the young Shoots or Sprouts that grow round about it, boil and eat it as we do <HI>Sparagus,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="49">
corruptly called Sparrowgra&s;s, the whole Plant is very like to our <HI>Carlina,</HI> only this hath bigger, higher and more prickly Heads, whereon ap|pear Fle&s;h-coloured Flowers. It being that it is every way like it, and that al&s;o the Root hath the &s;ame Vertue, for if you &s;teep it in Water, and drink of it, it maketh you vomit and fling up; therefore I am of opinion, that without doubt it mu&s;t be, the true <HI>Silybum Dio|&s;coridis</HI>: Be&s;ides this there grow al&s;o in the Road, and on old Walls, &s;uch plenty of <HI>Capers,</HI> that they are not at all e&s;teemed; they take the&s;e Flowers before they open, and pickle them, and eat them for Sauce with their Meat. I had al|mo&s;t forgot another Herb, which I found in their Gardens, that beareth roundi&s;h &s;mooth Stalks about two Foot high, the Leaves are two and two equally di&s;tant from one another, and one above the other, they are long, crenated at the &s;ides, like unto our <HI>Mercurialis</HI>; between them &s;prout out in harve&s;t time yellow Flowers, which produce long aculeated Cods, which open them&s;elves when they are ripe, within them are &s;ix di&s;tinctions, and in each of them little black Seeds placed in very good order: the Herb is of a &s;ower ta&s;te, like Sorrel, wherefore it is to every body (chiefly the <HI>Jews</HI>) known, which boil the Leaves thereof with their Meat to eat them: Wherefore &s;ome take it to be <HI>Olus Judaicum Avicennae,</HI> and others take it for <HI>Corchorum Plinii,</HI> whether it be or no I &s;u&s;pend my Judgment.</P>
<P>They have abundance of Pul&s;es in the&s;e Coun|tries, which they feed upon, &s;o that you &s;ee &s;everal in their <HI>Batzars</HI> which &s;ell nothing el&s;e but them. Among the re&s;t you will find abun|dance of <HI>Pha&s;eoli,</HI> or <HI>Kidney</HI> Beans, little and great ones, very white; and many &s;orts of <HI>Cicer,</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="50">
which they call <HI>Cotane,</HI> and with <HI>Avicenna Ha|mos.</HI> Whereof they have as many as we have Pea&s;e in our Country, and boil them for their daily Food, and oftentimes they eat them raw, chiefly if they be roa&s;ted till the outward Shell falls off, they often call for them thus dre&s;&s;ed, when they are a drinking in their Coffee-hou&s;es, and have them brought to Table with Chee&s;e after their Meals in&s;tead of Pre&s;erves, or Fruit, as <HI>Cibebs,</HI> Ha&s;el-nuts and the like, for they eat very mellow, and have a fine &s;alti&s;h Ta&s;te. They dre&s;s the <HI>Orobus</HI> after the &s;ame manner, which they call now <HI>Ades</HI> and <HI>Hades,</HI> but whe|ther right or no I leave to the Learned, they are &s;omewhat le&s;s and rounder, and not unlike the <HI>Cicers</HI> in their colour, only that the&s;e are reddi&s;h and white, and the other white and yellow. The&s;e put me &s;till in mind of another &s;trange Plant, by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Mas,</HI> who&s;e Leaves and Cods are prety like our <HI>Pha&s;eolus,</HI> and the Cods contain little round Seeds &s;omething le&s;s than our Pea&s;e, of a dark green colour, and are &s;o &s;mooth and &s;hining that they reflect again. <HI>Serapio</HI> maketh men|tion of them in his 116 Chapter under the Name of <HI>Mes.</HI> And <HI>Avicennas</HI> in his 488 Chap|ter under the Name <HI>Mei&s;ce</HI>; and the very lear|ned and experienced Botani&s;t <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius</HI> calleth it in his <HI>Epitome</HI> of the <HI>Indian</HI> Plants by the Name of <HI>Mungo.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> love the&s;e Pul&s;es very well, chiefly to eat them among their Rice.

They have al&s;o be&s;ides their Court, as well as the Emperour him&s;elf, peculiar Lodgings for their Concubines, which they either have pick'd up here and there out of Towns and Countries, or el&s;e taken in time of War by Sea and Land from Chri&s;tians and other Nations; wherefore they keep many Eunuchs to attend them con|&s;tantly. They take great delight in Hunting, and go often &s;everal Days Journeys after it: If they take Wild Boars, they give them (becau&s;e they are by their Laws forbid to eat them) to the Chri&s;tians, which maketh the <HI>Turks</HI> often to mock them in the Streets, crying out and calling them <HI>Chan&s;ir quibir,</HI> that is, great Boars or Hog-eaters. Although the <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> are great Per&s;ons, that Command over Cities and Coun|tries, yet they are rckoned to be, like others, but Slaves to their Ma&s;ter, that have nothing of their own, that they can bequeath to their Heirs or Po&s;terity after their decea&s;e, as our Princes can, becau&s;e the Emperour after their decea&s;e taketh Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their vi&s;ible E&s;tates, and allows only to their Children an Annuity: Nay, if their <HI>Sultan</HI> Commands them to go from one place to an Inferiour one, or to leave their Dig|nity quite and clean, they mu&s;t obey immedi|ately, if they will not run them&s;elves into greater Inconveniencies or Dangers. This is the Rea&s;on that &s;uch Per&s;ons, although Rich, &s;eldom build great Buildings, &s;o that you &s;ee none in all the Country, except it be a Chap|pel,

or a <HI>Champ,</HI> which they build to be re|membred by: They rather keep their Riches in Gold and Silver, which can be hid, and &s;o &s;ecretly given to their Po&s;terity. They be&s;tow but very little upon Jacks, for they are too Covetous, neither have they many Work-men that are able to &s;et them. The&s;e <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> being altogether for their own Advantage, that &s;trive to get Wealth, their Subjects mu&s;t needs &s;uffer very much under them, but chiefly Stran|gers, that live there to Traffick, as <HI>Italians, French|men, &amp;c.</HI> whereby between them and the <HI>Ba|&s;haws</HI> (that mind their own and not the Pub|lick Good) ari&s;e often great Differences, and they mu&s;t have &s;uffered great damage, if their Soveraigns, to prevent the&s;e things, and that their Subjects may deal &s;ecurely, had not ta|ken care to &s;end them di&s;creet and prudent Men, which are called <HI>Con&s;uls,</HI> endued with great Priviledges from the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> to hear their Complaints, and to protect them again&s;t any A&s;&s;aulters. It happened in my time, while I &s;taid there, that great Differences aro&s;e be|tween the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the new <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> who was &s;ent thither, in&s;tead of the decea&s;ed one, in the Year 75. the 6<HI>th.</HI> day of <HI>March,</HI> who came in to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with a great number of Hor&s;e and Foot. At his Arrival the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> went (accompanied with a great number of Merchants in great State) to meet him, to bid him Welcom, and pre&s;ented him with Fourteen Cloaths Richly wrought of Silk, de&s;iring him to take his Country-men into his Protection, that they might Trade and deal &s;afely under him. The <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> looking upon the Cloaths, behaved him&s;elf very unkindly, and looking upon them to be very incon&s;ide|rable,
<PB N="72" REF="52">
he not only refu&s;ed them, but an&s;wered the Con&s;ul very &s;cornfully. So it often happens that the&s;e great Per&s;ons come to differ, and pur|&s;ue their Differences &s;o far, that at la&s;t it mu&s;t be brought before the <HI>Emperour</HI> and his Court. If they find that the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> is in the wrong, he is immediately puni&s;hed (not regarding his great Authority) according to the default, ei|ther in Money, or el&s;e, if it be a great Crime, he mu&s;t lo&s;e his Life for it; which is the oftner done, becau&s;e they depend very much upon Traffick, which bringeth the Emperour in year|ly a very great Revenue. Yet notwith&s;tand|ing they are puni&s;hed &s;o &s;everely &s;ometimes, the Pride and Ambition of the <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> is &s;o great, that to uphold their Greatne&s;s, they will not cea&s;e to &s;trive by any means after Riches and great Wealth, which their Subjects (not to &s;peak of Strangers) find daily, whom they &s;queeze and pre&s;s, chiefly if they find them Rich, to that degree, that they cannot come to any thing, nor thrive under them: More|over they draw, after the decea&s;e of their Rich Subjects, for the mo&s;t part, the greate&s;t &s;hare of what they leave, into their own Pur&s;es; &s;o that &s;uch Per&s;ons do not take Pains, nor be&s;tow any great Co&s;t to build their Hou&s;es, or to till their Grounds, as we do in our Country. They have commonly in Market-Towns and Villages, low Hou&s;es or Halls, whereof many are &s;o covered with Hills, that you cannot &s;ee them, before you are quite at them. When you come into them, you find neither Chairs, nor Stools, nor Tables, only a couple of pieces of Tape&s;try &s;pread, whereon they &s;it after their fa&s;hion; and in&s;tead of Feather-Beds (whereof they make no u&s;e at all) they have Mats and Quilts,
<PB N="73" REF="52">
which they fold together in the Day, and hang them up in a corner, at Night they &s;pread them out again to &s;leep on them: They have no oc|ca&s;ion for Sheets, to cover them&s;elves as we do, nor for any Towels neither, for in&s;tead of them they u&s;e long pieces of Rags, which they hang about their naked Necks, or hang them at their Girdles. We &s;ee &s;ometimes in their Hou&s;es, above all in the Country, &s;everal &s;trange-&s;haped Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, which cover whole &s;ides of the Wall in their Rooms, which their Relations u&s;e to Pre&s;ent them with at their Wedding, which to plea&s;e them, they u&s;e to put up, and to keep there, rather for their Remembrance, than to make any other u&s;e of them. In their Kitchen they have very few Uten&s;ils, perhaps a few Pipkins, Pans, and Trenchers, for they boyl all their Victuals in one Pot together, that their Maids may not have many to clean&s;e, or to put up.</P>
<P>Concerning their Cloaths, they be&s;tow not very much upon them, although they be well to pa&s;s, for they love Money &s;o well, that they will rather &s;pend a whole day in contending for a Penny, than pay it willingly: Wherefore a Man that will Travel through the&s;e Countries, mu&s;t have his Pur&s;e well &s;tored, and keep it very clo&s;e, that no body may know its worth, but chiefly he mu&s;t have a care of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which are not to be tru&s;ted, if you will e&s;cape great danger: They will not only do nothing for you without Reward, but if they &s;u&s;pect you to have any Money, they will endeavour to get it from you. Wherefore tho&s;e that take a Pilgrimage into the Holy Land, and go in pitiful Cloaths, are not much troubled by them. The Courtiers of the <HI>Ba&s;haws,</HI> and among&s;t the
<PB N="74" REF="53">
re&s;t chiefly the Eunuchs and Dwarfs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where|of they have &s;everal, go in their Taffety and Sattin Cloaths, which are long, and very well trimmed, wherewith their Ma&s;ter furni&s;heth them, being Gifts from others, which he di&s;tri|buteth among them. The Souldiers, <HI>Spahees, Jani&s;aries, &amp;c.</HI> commonly have blew woollen Cloaths from the Court, and they live of their Pay, that is, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 <HI>Medins,</HI> (which are abut three Farthings apiece) more or le&s;s (ac|cording as their Places are) which are paid them daily, as well in Peace as in War-time: If they can get any thing el&s;e, by Excur&s;ions and Fighting, from their Enemies, it is well for them. The Souldiers commonly wear white Turbants on their Heads, and &s;o do all <HI>Turks,</HI> and put painted Paper underneath them, chiefly when they go into the War, believing if they wear them they cannot be hurt nor wounded. On their Turbants they commonly wear Cranes Feathers, that others may believe them to be Valiant Souldiers, and that by their Number People may gue&s;s that either they have been in &s;o many Campagnes, or el&s;e killed &s;o many Chri&s;tians. Be&s;ides the&s;e Turbants the <HI>Jani&s;a|ries</HI> have al&s;o Hats with high Crowns, called <HI>Zarcellas,</HI> made of white Felt, which they wear in&s;tead of Helmets, when they are in waiting, or go out to the War, the&s;e have before on the fore-head a gilded Sheath, &s;et without with Gra|nats Rubies, <HI>Turkey</HI>-&s;tones, and other Jewels, (yet of no great value) wherein they put their Feathers. They (and al&s;o other <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI>) let no Hair grow upon their Heads, but as &s;oon as it grows they &s;have it again, only behind they keep a lock, which hangs down a pretty way: They let their Beards grow now,
<PB N="75" REF="53">
which they u&s;ed formerly to cut off, &s;o that now for &s;ome Years they have worn huge great Mu&s;tachies. In War time they carry Mu&s;quets, and in Peace (chiefly when they are in waiting) their long Poles. They are al&s;o allowed to Marry, and be&s;ides their Wives, to keep any they take Pri&s;oners in the War, or el&s;e to &s;ell them to any body. When they are at home they are great lovers of Wine, and when they can come at it, that no body &s;ees them, they will drink more without mixture than any other Nation: But in time of War, when they are in Expedition, they can live very &s;paringly, and will March all day long before they will Refre&s;h them&s;elves. Yet to &s;peak the truth, the&s;e, and almo&s;t all Souldiers (becau&s;e they are as well paid in Peace as in War) are no more &s;o ready to take the Field, and to change a quiet Life for a trouble&s;ome one, or a &s;ecure one for a dangerous, as they they have been in former Ages, being u&s;ed to Lazine&s;s for a great while together. Be&s;ides the Power and Strength of the <HI>Turks</HI> is reckoned much inferiour to that of the Chri&s;tians, for we are better armed with Mu&s;quets and Pikes, to keep them off at a di|&s;tance, that they may not be able to come in with us to Club-Law, and &s;o over-power us; for if their Enemy doth not give way at the fir&s;t On-&s;et, they turn their backs and run a|way. But that notwith&s;tanding all this, we gain nothing from the <HI>Turks,</HI> but they rather from us; the rea&s;on is (not to mention our manifold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions) rather our great Di|vi&s;ions and Contentions, which hinder us from going out with &s;uch an Army as is nece&s;&s;ary, and we might otherways do. Wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> come out the bolder, to frighten and to
<PB N="76" REF="54">
plague us, and make u&s;e of all &s;orts of Strata|gems, to amu&s;e us, or to draw us into an Am|bu&s;h, by pur&s;uing them, and when they think we are almo&s;t tired, they fall upon us with a multitude of fre&s;h Men, to &s;urround and to beat us. Nor do they value it, if they lo&s;e one Regiment or another, becau&s;e there is enough of them, and they know how to have in the room of the Slain others again that will be ve|ry glad (becau&s;e of their Pay that they receive daily of their Prince out of his Provinces) to accept of it. It being then &s;o that he doth not only maintain his own Provinces, but rather gains others, and enlarges his Dominions daily, we ought to be very careful; for the more he increa&s;eth, the more we are in danger. Thus he taketh one Town, Country, or Kingdom after another with his Sword, as we have &s;een hitherto in <HI>Europe</HI> (not to mention any thing of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>) not without great detriment and damage to all Chri&s;tians. So he cometh daily the longer the nearer to us, that at length we mu&s;t expect no better Succe&s;s than <HI>Greece, Thra|cia, Servia, Bo&s;nia, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Wallachia, &amp;c.</HI> which are brought into Slavery, under which &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality &s;till groan to this day. So I found at <HI>Aleppo</HI> an Ancient Queen of <HI>Wal|lachia</HI> with her Sons, whereof the Younge&s;t was born after the King his Father's Death, who is maintained by a very &s;mall Allowance from the <HI>Turki&s;h Emperour.</HI> She is a very di&s;creet Woman, and well skill'd in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Lan|guages. Her Subjects &s;till hope for her, that God Almighty will re&s;tore her to them again, that &s;o their Slavery may have an end.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="54">After the <HI>Turks</HI> have obtained a great Victo|ry, they lift up their Hands, thank and prai&s;e God, and the Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> God Almighty's dearly beloved Me&s;&s;enger, and pray further, that God may &s;end Differences and Quarrels among us (that are again&s;t the Book <HI>Jugilis,</HI> as they call it, that is, the Book of the Go&s;pel) that the Magi&s;trates may quarrel with the Subjects, and the Clergy with the Seculars, that from thence may ari&s;e &s;uch Di&s;orders, that we may go on to tran&s;gre&s;s the Laws of God &s;till more and more; that our Belief in <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> may be ex|tingui&s;hed, and that all good Orders and Poli|cies may be di&s;&s;olved: So that God may take from thence occa&s;ion to make them further our Puni&s;hers to afflict us. And when they &s;ee that the Rich Men Oppre&s;s the Poor, that the Ma|gi&s;trates do not Protect the Ju&s;t and Innocent, but that the Chief and Heads do &s;trive to ruin one another, then they rejoyce at our Misfor|tune and Mi&s;ery, and do not fear us in the lea&s;t to do them any Mi&s;chief (which might ea&s;ily be done if we were unanimous) but rather threaten what Mi&s;chief they will do us.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Turks</HI> have taken a &s;trong Town, or a whole Country by the Sword, that they may keep them the ea&s;ier in Subjection without a great Garri&s;on, Pains, or Danger, they Demo|li&s;h the places that are not very &s;trong, and &s;end away the Nobility and Chief Per&s;ons, which otherwi&s;e might do them a great deal of Mi&s;|chief; and in the room of the&s;e they bring in <HI>Sangiacks,</HI> with their Souldiers, to keep the &s;trong places, and to take care of the Empe|rour's Revenue. So that in the&s;e places there is no Nobility, that come from any Ancient Races, and have their own E&s;tates Hereditary and De|&s;cending
<PB N="78" REF="55">
from Heir to Heir: Which one may al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e when he con&s;idereth that the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> alloweth to tho&s;e that adhere to it, to have four Wives at a time, be&s;ides Concu|bines, or Slaves as many as they plea&s;e: I will &s;ay nothing of the Liberty they have to Divorce them upon any &s;mall Occa&s;ion, and to take others in their room; from whence flow &s;uch Di&s;orders and Uncertainties, that very few Chil|dren know who are their Parents, and &s;o there is but little Love &s;hewn between them as one may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e. And this is no Di&s;grace to them, but rather reputed to be an Honour, be|cau&s;e they conclude from thence that tho&s;e that keep many Wives, behave them&s;elves diligently according to their Laws: Wherefore they &s;ooner tru&s;t them, prefer them before others, in Places and Salaries, and e&s;teem them to be true <HI>T&s;che|lebiis,</HI> that is, Noble-men. Although the&s;e and other <HI>Turks</HI> have &s;everal Wives, that are not all equal in their Birth and Extraction, yet they all have in Family Affairs their equal &s;hare and power, and they all are equally provided for, with Meat, Drink, Cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they have al&s;o their Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s equally among them: And that becau&s;e they bring their Hu&s;|band no Portion, but he mu&s;t rather buy them from their Parents, &s;ometimes for a con&s;iderable Sum of ready Money, and give them Cloaths and other Nece&s;&s;aries to boot: Wherefore the Matrimonial tye (which they call <HI>Chebia</HI>) is more in the power of the Husband than the Wife, &s;o that he may Marry one three times and reject her again; but further he mu&s;t not go, except he will be accounted a &s;candalous ba&s;e Fellow: As you may perceive by the words of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour <HI>Bajazet,</HI> which he
<PB N="79" REF="55">
did &s;end to <HI>Temyry,</HI> who is al&s;o called <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> &s;aying, that he had better to take a Wife again after he was three times divorced from her, than to go to War with him; which &s;cornful Lan|guage he might well have forborn: For <HI>Tamer|lan</HI> did not only beat him in a cruel and bloody Battle, but took him Pri&s;oner, and carried him about in an Iron Cage like a Wild Bea&s;t of the Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>But that I may return from whence I digre&s;|&s;ed, the Marriages of the <HI>Turks</HI> are never look'd upon to be ratified before they are married by one of their Prie&s;ts. Their Wives mu&s;t agree together, and live peaceably and amicably, and mu&s;t not re&s;i&s;t their Husbands, except he ma|keth inequality among them: If any &s;hould ap|pear (which happens very often) they do not forbear to complain of their Husband to the <HI>Cadi</HI> or Judge. So that daily very &s;trange Tran|&s;actions (which are not &s;trange to him) come before him: If &s;o be that the Husband is con|victed, and the Wife ab&s;olved, they are divor|ced immediately in the &s;ame hour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Women are pretty hand&s;om, and well &s;haped, very Civil in their Di&s;cour&s;es, and other Behaviour: When any of them is mar|ried, and carried to her Bridegroom's Hou&s;e, their Relations go along with her, that are in|vited, to the Wedding, and begin to make a noi&s;e immediately in the Streets, and extol their Voices more and more as they go along, that you may hear them a great way off.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> that are of &s;ome Condition, and rich and able Men, have at their Weddings &s;e|veral Diverting Shews; in the Day-time they have Dancing, Running, Actings, Singing; Jump|ing, and Leaping, and Dancing on the Ropes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="56">
After Sun-&s;et, and at Night, they let off Rockets, and Fire-works of &s;everal &s;orts, made artifici|ally. The&s;e are let off in publick and open places, that every one may &s;ee them, and they la&s;t often till break of Day. The Rope-dancers have three Ropes one above the other, whereof the uppermo&s;t is the longe&s;t; upon every one of them they have their peculiar Le&s;&s;ons, which they perform exactly and dexterou&s;ly, with Dancing, Jumping, Running, Ge&s;ticulating, go|ing upon Stilts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is plea&s;ant to look upon. Their Children when they are married, &s;oon forget their Parents, they dare not &s;ee them again in a great while, nor do they de&s;ire to do it.</P>
<P>When they have Children born, they do not ju&s;tly Circumci&s;e them on the Eighth Day, but let them be 8, 9, or 10 Years old, until they can make their Confe&s;&s;ion: There are &s;ome, chiefly among the <HI>Arabians,</HI> that imitate their Patriarch <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> who was not circumci&s;ed un|til the Thirteenth Year of his Age. It is com|monly performed in the Hou&s;e of their Parents. If Rich Mens Sons are circumci&s;ed, they make a Fea&s;t, and roa&s;t a whole entire Bullock, into his Belly they put a Wether, and into his Belly a Pullet, into the Pullet's Belly an Egg, and &s;o they roa&s;t them all together, what remaineth they give to the Poor. When the Children grow up, and begin to go, they cloath them in loo&s;e flying Coats, of fine Stuff, woven of &s;everal colours, which are plea&s;ant to look upon; and they put upon the Heads of tho&s;e that are not yet circumci&s;ed, coloured Caps, which are wrought with Flowers, and very common to be &s;old in their <HI>Batzars.</HI> After they are circum|ci&s;ed, they begin to wear white Turbants, which
<PB N="81" REF="56">
are made of Cotton, and rolled about their Caps after a peculiar manner, and are common|ly Twenty Yards long.</P>
<P>They have &s;till another &s;trange Cu&s;tom, which Young and Old, Men and Women u&s;e in the&s;e Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> They make a thin Pa&s;te of Galls and calcined Copperas, (to beautifie them&s;elves, and to keep their Eyes from Rheums) with it they blacken their Lips, and make a Ring round about their Eyes, in the &s;ame man|ner as our Ring-doves have about their Necks. The&s;e Paintings they have had Anciently, and &s;ome of them they have prepared of <HI>Stibium</HI> or Antimony: Of the&s;e Paintings of the Eye we read in &s;everal places, chiefly (that I may not mention others) in the 23<HI>d.</HI> Chap. of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> the 40 Ver&s;e, where the Lord &s;ays, by the Pro|phet, <HI>And lo, they came, for whom thou didst wa&s;h thy &s;elf, paintedst thy Eyes, and deckedst thy &s;elf with Ornaments.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Education of their Youth, they only learn in Schools to Read, and to write the <HI>Arabian</HI> Alphabet, the Characters or Letters whereof are common both to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> although their Languages are very differing: Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are other Schools, wherein the Young Men are In&s;tructed in the Emperour's Laws, and tho&s;e that go on in their Learning, and take it well, are &s;oon called to high Offices, (as <HI>Cadi's</HI> and <HI>Cadile&s;chiers.</HI>) But in Liberal Arts and Sciences, &s;uch as we teach in our Countries, they are not In&s;tructed, for they have not only none of the&s;e Learned Men, but e&s;teem learning of the&s;e Sciences a Super|fluity, and lo&s;s of Time; they rather love old Rhimes, and Ballads that &s;peak of and com|mend the Mighty Deeds of their Ancient Em|perours,
<PB N="82" REF="57">
and other Champions; or other Fan|cies that make Foreign Nations, or any of their Enemies ridiculous: And &s;uch things they put either them&s;elves into Rhimes, or el&s;e hear tho&s;e that have been put into Rhimes by others al|ready, which they &s;ay daily with peculiar Actions, out of Town in plea&s;ant Greens, (where al&s;o other Diverti&s;ements are performed with Singing, Dancing, Leaping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) So that they are rather plea&s;ed with the Reading of the&s;e frivolous &s;illy Writings, than to learn Arts and Sciences: Which you may evidently &s;ee, in that they do not e&s;teem, nor will admit of that Noble Art of Printing Books, that might inform them in any thing: Which the Clerks, whereof there is a great number up and down in the Cities, like very well, becau&s;e they daily take a great deal of Money for the Writings of their Pro|phet <HI>Mahomet</HI> and others, which maketh them generally very Rich, and wear greater Turbants than the re&s;t, that they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from others. Their Paper is generally &s;moothed and glazed, and they comprehend their Letters in very few Words: When they will make them up, they fold them up until they come to be no broader than an Inch, the outward crevi&s;e of the Paper they fill all along with Wax with|in, and &s;o glue it as it were to the other, or el&s;e they take any other Pa&s;te made for that purpo&s;e, and &s;o imprint their Name upon it with their Seal that is done over with Ink, &s;o that nothing remaineth white but the Letters: The&s;e Seals are generally made at <HI>Dama&s;co,</HI> where the be&s;t Arti&s;ts live that cut in Steel, and they put no|thing more in it but their Name. They do not make any u&s;e of Paper that is writ on, although they have great quantity thereof, neither to put

things up in, nor for any other u&s;e, and yet if they find any of it in the Street, they do not let it lye, but take it up carefully, fold it toge|ther, and put it into the next crevi&s;e they meet with, for they are afraid that the Name of God may be written on it: In&s;tead thereof the Gro|cers make u&s;e of great Leaves of <HI>Coloca&s;ia,</HI> where|of they have great &s;tore.</P>

So among the re&s;t of the Nations there are <HI>French-men</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> &amp;c. which have al&s;o there their peculiar Build|ings (which, as is before &s;aid, are called <HI>Fun|diques</HI>) wherein &s;ome live together, and others (chiefly the <HI>Italians</HI> that are married) live with|out in Lodgings; they have very &s;mall Habita|tions, and live &s;paringly like the <HI>Turks.</HI> In the&s;e <HI>Champs</HI> you meet with &s;everal &s;orts of &s;trange Merchandi&s;es, before all in <HI>Champ Agami,</HI> where you have all &s;orts of Cotton-works, <HI>viz.</HI> Hand|kerchiefs, long Fillets, Girdles, which they roll a|bout their Loins and Heads, and other &s;orts, by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Mo&s;&s;ellini</HI> (after the Country <HI>Mu&s;&s;oli,</HI> from whence they are brought, which is &s;ituated in <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI>) by us <HI>Mu&s;lin</HI>; with the&s;e do the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gentlemen Cloath them&s;elves in Summer. There is delicate Tape&s;try, Arti|ficially wrought with all manner of colours, &s;uch as are &s;ometimes brought over by us. From <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they bring great quantity of an unknown <HI>Manna</HI> in Skins, by the name of <HI>Trun&s;chibil,</HI> which is gathered from a prickly Shrub, called by the <HI>Arabians, Agul</HI> and <HI>Albagi,</HI> which is the rea&s;on that it is mixt with &s;mall Thorns and reddi&s;h Chaff.

The Root thereof is pretty long, of a brown colour, its leaves long, like unto tho&s;e of <HI>Polygonum,</HI> of an A&s;h colour; tho&s;e that grow at the bottom of the Thorns are of a warm and dry Quality. The People u&s;e the Herb for a Purge, they take a handful thereof and boyl it in Water. Be&s;ides this they have another <HI>Manna</HI> like unto that, that cometh to us from <HI>Calabria</HI> by the way of <HI>Venice, and is the concreted Saccarine Exudation of the</HI> Or|nus.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t they al&s;o &s;hew co&s;tly Stones, by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Bazaor,</HI> which are ob|long and roundi&s;h, and &s;mooth without, and of a dark green Colour.

Proofs to know whether they are good or no, which a Merchant communicated to me as in|fallible.

<P>From <HI>India</HI> they bring hither many delicate Spices, <HI>Cinnamon, Spicnard, Long Pepper, Tur|bith, Cardamoms, Nutmegs, Mace,</HI> and <HI>China Roots,</HI> which the <HI>Arabians</HI> make more u&s;e of then of <HI>Guajacum,</HI> and delicate <HI>China</HI> Cups and Di|&s;hes, <HI>Indico:</HI> and in very great quantity they bring that noble Root called <HI>Rhubarb.</HI> And moreover, they &s;ell &s;everal &s;orts of precious Stones, <HI>viz.

With the Spices are &s;ometimes by the Merchants brought from the <HI>Indies</HI> delicate Canes, which are very long, &s;olid, or full within, flexible and bright without, of a yellowi&s;h Colour, they are al|mo&s;t every-where alike thick, only a little ta|pering; but few Joynts, far di&s;tant from one another, and are hardly &s;een in them.

You find al&s;o in the Shops another &s;ort of Canes to be Sold, which are &s;mall and hollow within, and &s;mooth without, a browni&s;h red Colour, wherewith <HI>Turks, Moors,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Peo|ple write, for to write with Goo&s;e-Quills is not in u&s;e with them; wherefore the&s;e may be e|&s;teemed to be the true <HI>Syringas</HI> or <HI>Fi&s;tularis</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;cor:</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e there is another bigger &s;ort of Canes, almo&s;t of the &s;ame Colour, but full of Joynts; the Pilgrims that go to &s;ee their <HI>Ma|homet</HI> bring the&s;e with them from <HI>Mecha,</HI> and the People of that Country carry them along with them on Hor&s;eback in&s;tead of &s;hort Pikes, chiefly the <HI>Arabians,</HI> for they are long, &s;trong,

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e above-mentioned <HI>Champs,</HI> there are a great many more without and within the City, where al&s;o all &s;orts of Merchandi&s;es are Sold, <HI>viz.

There are al&s;o Turners, Fletchers that make Arrows and Darts, and Bow-makers, that have be&s;ides their Shops &s;mall Butts, that any body that goes by may exerci&s;e him&s;elf, or try his Bow before he buyeth it. The&s;e Bows are &s;ometimes plain Work, and &s;ome inlaid with Ivory, Buflers Horns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which maketh them of a differing Price. The Archers wear a Ring upon their right Thumbs, as our Merchants wear their Seals wherewith they draw the String on when they are going to &s;hoot, the&s;e are made of Wood, Horn, or Silver, and &s;ome are &s;et with Precious Stones. Be&s;ides the&s;e you find in great <HI>Batzars</HI> &s;ome Barbar-Surgeons, which, (when they have no body to trim) u&s;e to go a|bout the Streets with their In&s;truments and a Flask of Lather to look out for Work; if they find any that will be trimed they do not come back to their Shops but go to Work in the Streets, or in the next <HI>Champ</HI> if any be near, and there begin to Lather him, and &s;have all the Hair of his Head, &s;ave only one long Lock which he leaves to hang down his Back.

Among&s;t them you will often &s;ee drunken <HI>Turks,</HI> which u&s;e to pu&s;h People that do not give them the way immediately, chiefly if they be Chri&s;tians; but the Chri&s;tians are not afraid of them for all that, but prepare them&s;elves (when they perceive &s;ome of them to approach among the People) and &s;tand upon their Guard to be even with them, and when the <HI>Turks</HI> come and pu&s;h them, they make them rebound again to one &s;ide, or to one of the Shop-boards. Sometimes al&s;o the <HI>Turks</HI> will lean them&s;elves backwards again&s;t the Shops, and when they &s;ee a Chri&s;tian go by they let him fall over their Legs, and &s;o laugh at them, but then the Chri&s;tians again when they per|ceive this, they kick up the other Leg of the <HI>Turk</HI> whereon he re&s;ts and &s;o make him fall down him&s;elf. For it is u&s;ual with the <HI>Turks</HI> to try the Chri&s;tians what Metal they are made of, whether they have Courage or no, wherefore they oftentimes before they are aware of them, a&s;&s;ault the Chri&s;tians with rough Words, and if they find them to be affraid they laugh at them to boot, but if they re&s;i&s;t them they give over immediately as &s;oon as they find them in earne&s;t (ju&s;t like &s;ome Dogs that &s;ooner bark then bite)

and e&s;teem him afterwards the more for it, and call them brave People that are fit for the War.</P>
<P>You find al&s;o in this Crowd &s;everal that are in Orders, called <HI>Sacquatz,</HI> (which commonly are Pilgrims that have been at <HI>Mecha</HI>) that go about with Skins full of Water, and for Chari|ty give to any, nay, even to the Chri&s;tians that de&s;ire it: (becau&s;e the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> are for|bid to drink Wine in their <HI>Alcoran</HI>) Wherefore you &s;ee many in their peculiar Habits (moved thereunto by Devotion) that go all day long a|mong the People to exerci&s;e a Work of Love and Charity to tho&s;e that are thir&s;ty. They have in one hand a fine gilded Cup whereinto they power the Water out of their Skins, wherein they have commonly laid Chalcedonicks, Ja|&s;pirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sometimes al&s;o delicate ta&s;ted Fruit, to keep the Water fre&s;h, and to recreate the People. When they give you to Drink out of it they reach you al&s;o a Looking-gla&s;s with this Admonition, That you &s;hall look your &s;elf in it, and remember that you are Mortal and mu&s;t die. For this Service they de&s;ire nothing of you, but if you give them any thing they take it and thank you, and &s;pout into your Face and Beard (to &s;hew their thankfulne&s;s) &s;ome fragrant Water which they have in Gla&s;&s;es, in a great Pouch tip'd with many Bra&s;s Cla&s;ps. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> al&s;o e&s;teem it to be a great Charity and Love, if they let their Mar|ble Troughs or great Pots that &s;tand everywhere about their Doors be filled up with fre&s;h Water every day, that Travellers or any that are dry may quench their Thir&s;t as they pa&s;s by; in it hang little Kettles to drink out of: If one goes to it, others that &s;ee him go al&s;o, and drink ra|ther

for Companies &s;ake then to quench their Thir&s;t: So you find often a whole Multitude a|bout a Pot. If you have a mind to eat &s;ome|thing or to drink other Liquors, there is com|monly an open Shop near it, where you &s;it down upon the Ground or Carpets and drink together. Among the re&s;t they have a very good Drink, by them called <HI>Chaube,</HI> (Coffee) that is almo&s;t as black as Ink, and very good in illne&s;s, chiefly that of the Stomach; of this they drink in the Morning early in open places before every body, without any fear or regard out of <HI>China</HI> Cups, as hot as they can, they put it often to their Lips but drink but little at a time, and let it go round as they &s;it. In this &s;ame Water they take a Fruit called <HI>Bunru,</HI> which in its Bigne&s;s, Shape, and Colour, is almo&s;t like unto a Bay-berry, with two thin Shells &s;urrounded, which as they informed me are brought from the <HI>Indies</HI>; but as the&s;e in them&s;elves are, and have within them, two yellowi&s;h Grains in two di&s;tinct Cells, and be&s;ides, being they agree in their Virtue, Fi|gure, Looks, and Name, with the <HI>Buncho</HI> of <HI>Avicen,</HI> and <HI>Bancha</HI> of <HI>Ra&s;is ad Almans</HI> exactly; therefore I take them to be the &s;ame, until I am better informed by the Learned. This Li|quor is very common among them, wherefore there are a great many of them that &s;ell it, and others that &s;ell the Berries, everywhere in their <HI>Batzars</HI>: They e&s;teem it as highly as we do in our Country Wormwood Wine, or that that is pre|pared with &s;everal Herbs and Drugs: yet they love Wine better if their Law would allow them to drink it, as we have &s;een in the Reign of the Emperour <HI>Selymo,</HI> when he gave them leave to drink it, that they met together daily in Drinking-hou&s;es, and drunk to one another,
<PB N="93" REF="62">
not only two or three Gla&s;&s;es of &s;trong Wine not mixed with Water, but four or five of &s;uch as came from <HI>Venice</HI> to them &s;o quickly one af|ter another with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, (as I have of|ten &s;een it) that they would not allow them&s;elves to eat a Morcel or two between it; and &s;o as you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, they become to be &s;or|did pre&s;ently, and &s;o Hoggi&s;h, that they excel all other Nations in it. But after <HI>Selymus</HI> was dead, and his Son <HI>Amurath</HI> &s;ucceeded him in his right, he immediately forbad them to drink Wine in the very beginning of his Reign, and looked after it with &s;uch &s;everity, that any bo|dy that did but &s;mell of Wine was Impri&s;oned immediately, put out of his place, and a great Fine put upon him according to his capacity, or for want of it, puni&s;hed &s;everely with many Blows under his Soals. During this Prohibition it happened, that when the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> of <HI>Halepo</HI> had a mind to go abroad and met in the Court|yard one of his men that was Drunk, and per|ceived it by his &s;taggering, he drew his Scime|ter and cut off his Head, and &s;o left him dead upon the place. But yet notwith&s;tanding all this Severity, and be it never &s;o peremptorily forbid, they do not only not mind &s;uch Prohi|bition, chiefly the Renegadoes, (being very much u&s;ed to it) but long and linger the &s;ooner after it with that eagerne&s;s, that in the Summer time they u&s;e to carry in privately (ju&s;t like the Ants) great quantities of Wine, and lay up good Stores that they may meet at Night and drink together until they have their Bellies full, and &s;o re&s;t after it all Night that they might not &s;mell of Wine the next Day. In that time when they were prohibited to drink Wine we Chri&s;ti|ans fared very well and bought our Wine very
<PB N="94" REF="63">
cheap, until afterwards they had leave to drink it again: Their Wines are generally red, very good and plea&s;ant, they keep it in Skins; they are brought to <HI>Halepo</HI> from &s;everal places, but chiefly from a famous Town called <HI>Ni&s;is,</HI> which lieth two days Journey di&s;tant from it upon the Borders of <HI>Armenia:</HI> The u&s;e of Skins is &s;till ve|ry great with them as it was in former Ages, as we may &s;ee by the &s;imilitude of Chri&s;t, when in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> Chap. 9. Ver&s;. 17. he &s;ays, <HI>No man put new wine into,</HI> &amp;c. Seeing that the Chri&s;tians have leave to drink Wine, therefore they &s;ell and buy mo&s;t of it, they al&s;o plant it, and have whole Villages in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, with abundance of Vineyards. But the <HI>Turks</HI> not being allowed to drink Wine by their Laws do not keep or cultivate many Vineyards, and if they do they pre&s;s the Grapes after &s;everal ways, for &s;ome they make into <HI>Cibebs,</HI> chiefly the&s;e People that live in and about <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> where indeed the be&s;t groweth; others boyl the Juice of the Grapes up to the con&s;i&s;tence of Honey which they call <HI>Pachmatz,</HI> chiefly the&s;e that live at <HI>Andeb,</HI> a Town between <HI>Bir</HI> and <HI>Ni|&s;ib.</HI> They have two &s;orts of this rob, one very thick, and the other &s;omewhat thinner, the former is the be&s;t, wherefore they put it up into little Barrels to &s;end into other Countries, the latter they u&s;e them&s;elves, mix it &s;ometimes with Water and give it to drink (in&s;tead of a Julep) to their Servants, &s;ometimes they put it into lit|tle Cups, to dip their Bread in it, as if it were Honey, and &s;o eat it. Be&s;ides the&s;e they have other &s;weet Drinks which they prepare out of red Berries called <HI>Jujubes</HI> (or of <HI>Cibebs,</HI> which when boiled in Water with a little Honey the Inhabitants call <HI>Ha&s;&s;ap</HI>) and others called &s;till
<PB N="95" REF="63">
by the old name of <HI>Berberis,</HI> of which they bring great quantities down from Mount <HI>Liba|nus.</HI> Among other Liquors they have a &s;pecial one called <HI>T&s;cherbeth,</HI> which boiled of Honey ta&s;teth like unto our Mead; they have another made of Barley or Wheat, by the Ancients called <HI>Zychus</HI> and <HI>Curmi:</HI> the&s;e two la&s;t make the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o merry and elevated, that as our Clowns do when they drink Beer, they &s;ing and play on their Hautboys, Cornets, and Ket|tle Drums (which their Mu&s;icians make u&s;e of every Morning when the Guards are relieved): All the&s;e Liquors are &s;old in their great <HI>Batzars,</HI> where they have Baskets full of Ice and Snow all the Summer long, whereof they put &s;o much into the Drink that it maketh their Teeth chat|ter and quake again. Thus much I thought convenient to mention of their Liquors or Drinks.</P>
<P>Concerning their Food, their Bread is nou|ri&s;hing and good, and &s;o white, chiefly at <HI>Ha|lepo,</HI> that none is like it in all <HI>Turkey:</HI> &s;o they have &s;everal &s;orts of it, of &s;everal &s;hapes and mixtures, whereof &s;ome are done with Yolks of Eggs, &s;ome mixt with &s;everal &s;orts of Seeds, as of Se&s;amum, <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Coriander, and wild Garden Saffron, which is al&s;o &s;trowed upon it; Meat is cheap with them and very good, by rea&s;on of the precious Herbs that grow there|about, chiefly upon Mount <HI>Tauri,</HI> which ex|tendeth it&s;elf very far Ea&s;twards, from whence they have abundance of Cattel, as Rams, Wea|thers, and Sheep with broad and fat Tails, whereof one weigheth &s;everal Pounds. They have al&s;o great &s;tore of Goats which they drive daily in great Numbers through that City to &s;ell their Milk, which every one that hath a mind

to it drinks warm in the open Streets; among them there are &s;ome that are not very big, but have Ears two foot long, &s;o that they hang down to the Ground and hinder them from feeding, when one of them is cut off which is common|ly done, they turn them&s;elves always upon that &s;ide that the other Ear may not hinder them from feeding. They have no want of Beefes and Bufles, for they are very common there, and the Butchers kill the Bea&s;ts in the Fields without Town, where they have their Slaugh|ter-hou&s;es; thereabout are a great many Dogs that live of the Offels, and have their young ones in Holes and Cliffs where they bring them up, and the&s;e become &s;o Ravenous and Wild, that they run about in the Night after their Prey (as I am informed) like Wolffs in our Country: And this may very well be, for the <HI>Turks</HI> do not only not kill any Dogs but rather carry them home when they are young, and there feed them till they are grown up and able to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and they believe that they do a deed of Charity that is very acceptable to God Al|mighty: like unto the Divines in the <HI>Indies,</HI> cal|led <HI>Banians,</HI> which &s;erve the Birds in the &s;ame manner as the&s;e do the Dogs and Cats. The&s;e Wolves are more like to our Dogs both in Shape and Bigne&s;s; and &s;o &s;ays <HI>Pliny,</HI> that the Wolves in <HI>Aegypt</HI> are le&s;s and la&s;ier then the&s;e towards the North; being there are no Inns in <HI>Turkey,</HI> where, as with us, Travellers may Lodge and have their Diet, therefore there is a great many Cake-&s;hops kept in the <HI>Batzars,</HI> where all man|ner of Victuals are cleanly dre&s;&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> But|chers Meat, Fouls, and all &s;orts of Sauces, and Broths, and Soups, where every body buys what he hath a mind to, according to the ca|pacity

of his Pur&s;e. Among the re&s;t nothing is &s;o common as Rice, which they boyl up to &s;uch a &s;tiffne&s;s, that it crumbleth. A great many other &s;orts you &s;hall &s;ee in Copper Ba|&s;ons, upon their Shop-boards, prepared after the &s;ame way, among&s;t the re&s;t peculiarly a very common one, called <HI>Bnuhourt,</HI> made of Barley and Wheat, which were fir&s;t broke on a Mill, and perhaps dryed, and &s;o boyled with or with|out Milk, into a thick Pap. <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> in the 83d Chapter of his Second Book, maketh men|tion of this by the name of <HI>Crimnon</HI>; and al&s;o <HI>Avicen.</HI> and <HI>Rha&s;as ad Alman&s;. in Synonymis,</HI> cal|leth it <HI>Sanguick</HI> and <HI>Savick.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> provide them&s;elves with good &s;tore of this, chiefly in War-time, by Water and by Land, that when they want Provi&s;ion, they may make u&s;e of it in&s;tead of Bread. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they have more Di&s;hes among&s;t them: I remember one called <HI>Trachan</HI>; when it is dre&s;&s;ed, it is &s;o tough, that you may draw it out like Glue; this they make up into little pieces, which being dryed, will keep good a great while, and is very good and plea&s;ant Food after it is boyled; wherefore they lay up great Stores of this in their &s;trong Forti|fications, as we do of Corn, that in ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity they may eat it in&s;tead of Bi&s;quets, or other Food. That &s;uch &s;orts of Foods (by the Latini&s;ts called <HI>P&ugrave;ls</HI>) have been very well known to the Ancients, and that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they u&s;e to make a &s;hift with it, <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth in his Eighteenth Book, and the Eighth Chapter.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o all manner of Poultry in great plenty, <HI>viz.</HI> Pullen, Snipes, Partridges with red Bills, Woodcocks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but very few Fi&s;hes, becau&s;e they have only a &s;mall Rivolet,

(which is full of Turtles) &s;o that at <HI>Halepo</HI> they are very &s;carce: Neither do they e&s;teem them much, becau&s;e mo&s;t of them drink Water in|&s;tead of Wine (which is prohibited by their Law) wherefore there are but very few brought thither from foreign places, as <HI>Antiochia,</HI> and the great River <HI>Euphrates, &amp;c.</HI> di&s;tant from thence two or three miles. Be&s;ides this, they have little By-di&s;hes, as Kal, Colliflowers, Car|rots, Turneps, French-Beans, Be&s;ides Trees and Codded Fruits, and many more; but yet they are not &s;o well skilled in the dre&s;&s;ing of them, as we are in our Country.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, They put al&s;o up with their <HI>Chee&s;e, Cibebs, Almonds, dryed Cicers, Pi&s;tachio's,</HI> and crack'd <HI>Ha&s;el-nuts,</HI> which (although they are carried thither from our Country) are better ta&s;ted, and plea&s;anter than ours. They have many &s;orts of Pre&s;erves, very well done with Sugar and Hony; very artificially (chiefly tho&s;e they carry about to &s;ell upon Plates very well garni&s;h'd) made up and &s;et out with &s;everal Colours and Shapes very beautiful to behold. For the re&s;t, they live very &s;paringly, and bring the Year round with &s;mall and little Expences, for they do not make &s;o great Fea&s;ts, nor have &s;o many Di&s;hes, nor be&s;tow &s;o great Co&s;t as we do in our Country.</P>
<P>In the&s;e <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Countries they eat upon the plain Ground, and when it is Dinner-time they &s;pread a round piece of Leather, and lay about it Tape&s;try, and &s;ometimes Cu&s;hions, whereupon they &s;it cro&s;s-leg'd: Before they begin to eat, they &s;ay Grace fir&s;t, then they eat and drink ha&s;tily, and every one taketh what he has a mind to, and do not talk much. The Rich have fine Cotton-Linnen about their Necks, hanging

downwards, or el&s;e hanging at their Silk-gir|dles, which they u&s;e in&s;tead of Napkins: Their Wives or Women do not eat with them, but keep them&s;elves in their peculiar Apartments. After they have done, they ri&s;e altogether with a Jerk, &s;winging them&s;elves about, which our Countrymen cannot ea&s;ily imitate, till after they have been there a long while, for the Limbs are numbed in &s;itting cro&s;s-legg'd, &s;o that one hath a great deal to do to bring them to them&s;elves again. At la&s;t they take up the Leathern Table, with Bread and all, which therefore &s;erveth them al&s;o in&s;tead of a Table-Cloth and Bread-basket, they draw it toge|ther with a String, like a Pur&s;e, and hang it up in the next corner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Short and Plain Relation of Plants, which I gathered during my stay at</HI> Halepo, <HI>in and round about it, not without great dan|ger and trouble, which I glued upon Paper very carefully.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEing I undertook this long Journey, chiefly on purpo&s;e to &s;ee my &s;elf tho&s;e fine Out|landi&s;h Plants, whereof Authors &s;o often make mention, growing in their native Soil, and &s;o gain a more clear and perfect Knowledge of them. I was very glad to have an opportunity to &s;tay longer than I intended, that I might the oftner go out with my Friends and Com|rades into the Fields, among the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> (not without great pain and danger of being knock'd on the Head) to fetch in more and greater variety of Plants: Wherein my Comrade <HI>Hans Ulrich Krafft,</HI> who came into the&s;e parts along with me, very often hath faithfully and hone&s;tly a&s;&s;i&s;ted me. But ha|ving heretofore made mention of the Garden-Herbs and Fruits, I will only in this place write of them which grow abroad without the Gar|dens, and that with all po&s;&s;ible &s;hortne&s;s, and begin with the <HI>Poplar-Tree,</HI> as the commone&s;t of all, which the Inhabitants &s;till call by the an|cient <HI>Arabian</HI> Name <HI>Haur</HI>; they grow very
<PB N="101" REF="66">
high in the&s;e Countries, and abundance of them grow about the Rivolet near <HI>Halepo,</HI> which make very &s;hady Walks underneath in the heat of Summer. There is al&s;o a peculiar &s;ort of Willow-Trees, called <HI>Safcaf, &amp;c.</HI> the&s;e are not all alike in bigne&s;s and heighth, and in their Stems and Twigs they are not very unlike unto Birch-Trees, (which are long, thin, weak, and of a pale-yellow colour) they have &s;oft A&s;h-colour'd Leaves, or rather like unto the Leaves of the Poplar-Tree, and on their Twigs here and there are Shoots of a &s;pan long, like unto tho&s;e of the <HI>Cyprioti&s;h wild Fig-trees,</HI> which put forth in the Spring tender and woolly Flowers, like unto the Blo&s;&s;oms of the Poplar-Tree, only they are of a more drying quality, of a pale co|lour, and a fragrant &s;mell. The Inhabitants pull of the&s;e (becau&s;e they bear no Fruits) great quantities, and di&s;til a very precious and &s;weet Water out of them, very comfortable and cor|roborating to the Heart. The <HI>Arabians</HI> call the&s;e Trees <HI>Zacneb</HI> and <HI>Zacnabum; Rha&s;es</HI> in 353<HI>d,</HI> and <HI>Avicenna</HI> in his 749<HI>th</HI> Chapt. And after the &s;ame manner maketh <HI>Serapio</HI> mention of them in his 261<HI>&s;t</HI> Chapt. by the common Name of <HI>Zucumbeth</HI>; and <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> in his Fourth Book, and Eleventh Chapter, where he treats of <HI>Elae-agnus,</HI> which this is very like unto, and may be taken for the &s;ame, although they differ in bigne&s;s, which often and ea&s;ily happens according to the &s;oyl and place where they grow. Hereabout are other &s;mall Trees, which I rather take to be thorny Shrubs; they are very like in leaves unto the others, and are called by the <HI>Moors Sci&s;e&s;un.</HI> They love to grow in moi&s;t places, and in Hedges; from the Root &s;hoot &s;everal Stems, cloathed with a
<PB N="102" REF="67">
&s;mooth brown-colour'd Bark; they bear at top pretty long and &s;trong Twigs, which here and there are be&s;et with a few Prickles, whereon grow &s;mall Flowers, white without and yellow within, whereof three and three &s;prout out between the Leaves. I did not &s;ee any of their Fruit, but yet I do believe that they are like un|to the Olives of the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Olive-Tree, to which this Plant is very like, which is very na|turally delineated in the Herbal of the learned <HI>Matthiolus.</HI> The&s;e Trees ca&s;t forth &s;uch an odour in the Spring, that any body that goes by mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible of it pre&s;ently. Wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> cut many of their Branches, and &s;tick them up in their Shops.</P>
<P>On the Banks of the above-mentioned Ri|volet, chiefly about the Stone-Bridge, as you travel to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> grow many <HI>Agnus Ca&s;tus's,</HI> of the le&s;&s;er &s;ort, and on the other &s;ide, in the Fields, many <HI>Pistachia</HI> Nut-trees.</P>
<P>Within and without the City grow al&s;o many &s;orts of Trees, <HI>viz.</HI> that which <HI>Avicen.</HI> calleth <HI>Azedarack,</HI> but <HI>Rha&s;es, Astergio</HI>; white Mul|berry-Trees, Date-Trees, and Cypre&s;&s;es, by the Natives called <HI>Sacub</HI> (which hereabout grow very big and high) Turpentine-Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>About the Fences and Hedges you will find wild Pomgranate-Trees, with fine double Flow|ers, wild Almond-Trees, the Fruit whereof the <HI>Moors</HI> carry about in great plenty to &s;ell to the Poor; and near it, in old decay'd Brick-walls, and Stony places, you &s;hall &s;ee Caper-bu&s;hes: Among the re&s;t there groweth a very &s;trange Bu&s;h, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Morg&s;ani,</HI> which is very green and thick, hath a long Woody Coat, whereout &s;prout &s;everal Stalks, with
<PB N="103" REF="67">
round Leaves, like unto <HI>Caper-leaves,</HI> only with this difference, that four of them &s;tand together all oppo&s;ite to one another, like unto our Beans; between them there appear &s;mall Flowers, red within and white without, whereout grow long Pods, like unto the&s;e of the <HI>Se&s;amum.</HI> This Plant hath a very unplea&s;ant &s;cent, wherefore the Inhabitants u&s;e it frequently to de&s;troy Worms: But what the Ancients formerly called it, I know not, but really am of this opinion, it mu&s;t be according to the de&s;cription the <HI>Ar|difrigi</HI> of <HI>Avicen.</HI> and <HI>Aadician</HI> of <HI>Rha&s;is</HI>; he that plea&s;eth may read more thereof in the quoted places. In the&s;e places is al&s;o found the thorny <HI>Acacia,</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Shack,</HI> and by the <HI>Arabians Schamuth,</HI> which are very &s;mall and low, chiefly the&s;e that &s;tand in the Fields, which give as much trouble to the Plowmen as the Ferns and Re&s;t-harrow do here; the Twigs are of an A&s;hen-colour, crooked, full of Prickles, like unto tho&s;e of a Ro&s;e-bu&s;h, and have very &s;mall-feather'd Leaves, like unto <HI>Tragacantha,</HI> which are almo&s;t divided like unto our female Fern, the Flowers of them I have not &s;een, but the Cods that grow out of them are without browni&s;h, in their &s;hape thicker and rounder than our Beans, &s;pongy within, and containing two or three reddi&s;h Seeds.</P>
<P>I have, be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;een in Shops Pods of a Che&s;tnut-brown colour, &s;old under the name of <HI>Cardem,</HI> which have two or three little di&s;tinct Cells or Baggs, in each whereof is a reddi&s;h Seed, in the Figure of our male <HI>Bal&s;am</HI>; the&s;e are brought from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and by &s;ome thought to be the true <HI>Acacia Dio&s;c.</HI> whether it be &s;o or no I cannot well tell, becau&s;e I never &s;aw the Plant. Very near it, in untilled places, groweth
<PB N="104" REF="68">
<HI>Galega; Si&s;ynrichium Theophra&s;ti,</HI> which is very curiou&s;ly delineated in the Book of <HI>Rempert. Dodon. de herbis &amp; floribus coron.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o found another fine Plant, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Thara&s;alis,</HI> which hath &s;even or eight waved Leaves, which &s;tand about a round Stalk, almo&s;t as it is to be &s;een in <HI>Si&s;yn|richium,</HI> only they are a great deal broader, and not &s;o long, when the Stalk thereof (which is not above a cubit long) is grown, through and above them; it gets at top a white Flower, not very unlike unto the low blew Flower de Luce which blow early in the Spring; it has a roun|di&s;h Root, like unto that of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> and al&s;o has many long white Fibres. Not far from thence, when you get upon the Hill, there groweth in the rough places others, <HI>viz. Bi&s;tor|ta,</HI> &s;till by the Inhabitants called <HI>Zuph,</HI> a fine &s;ort of <HI>Verbacum; Scorzonera</HI> with purple Flo|wers, Saffron with &s;mall little Leaves, and a de|licate yellow Flower; al&s;o <HI>Ari&s;arum, Homaid.</HI> and <HI>Arum,</HI> called by them <HI>Car&s;aami,</HI> whereof there are four &s;orts, among the re&s;t a &s;trange one, with long Ears, wherefore they call it in their Language <HI>Ovidne.</HI></P>
<P>There al&s;o are about the Rivers &s;ome <HI>Anemo|nes</HI> of &s;everal &s;orts, and of &s;everal colours, very beautiful, as red, purple colour, yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which they call with a common name <HI>Sakaick,</HI> and give an additional Name accor|ding to the colour to it, <HI>viz. Schackaick ach|mar, Sakaik a&s;&s;ar, A&s;erack, &amp;c.</HI> that is to &s;ay, red-yellow, of a Violet colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which would be too long and tedious, to de&s;cribe all here: Chiefly if I &s;hould at length relate the common ones, as, <HI>Wild Rue, A&s;phodelus albus; Rhe&s;eda Plin. Flos &s;olis foliis minoribus &s;erpilli,
<PB N="105" REF="68">
Wild Onions,</HI> and other innumerable more. As you come down by another way back again, nearer to the Corn-Fields, you find other fine Herbs, as the wild new <HI>Harmala,</HI> a delicate &s;ort of <HI>A&s;tragalus foliis hedy&s;ari minoris,</HI> and by it another which is very like unto <HI>A&s;tragalus</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;cor.</HI> &s;o that I really believe it to be the &s;ame. There appear a great many of them upon the the heighth; it is a low Herb, with a long browni&s;h Root, as big and long as the Roots of Hor&s;e-radi&s;h, which puts out at the &s;ides &s;ome &s;trong Fibres, which are almo&s;t blacker and harder to cut than the Root it &s;elf: Some of them go downwards, and others the greater part upwards, and bended like unto Horns. The&s;e contain, together with their &s;weetne&s;s, al&s;o a dryne&s;s; they &s;hoot out at the top into &s;everal Branches of the &s;ame colour, yet not above the length of a Finger, which encline to|wards the Earth, where out grow nine or ten &s;mall Leaves, like <HI>Lentil-leaves,</HI> not very unlike to tho&s;e of <HI>Orobus,</HI> and di&s;tributed after the &s;ame manner. Between them &s;prout out pur|ple-brown Flowers, after them come long and thick and full Bladders, whereof &s;ome are as big as tho&s;e of the <HI>Colutea.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e, and &s;everal other Herbs, have I pre&s;erved and glued to &s;ome Paper with great and peculiar care, &s;o that they are to be &s;een in their natural colours, &s;o exact as if they were green.</P>
<P>About the River, up a Hill, I found a ten|der and fragrant Herb, with long and white Roots, of a pretty acrimonious ta&s;te, its Leaves were like unto our Coriander, only &s;omewhat rounder, and not &s;o much cut, but only a little about the edges; I found no Stalks nor Flowers,
<PB N="106" REF="69">
for it was early in the year, and about <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> which is the time of their fir&s;t &s;pringing, the&s;e they called <HI>Zarneb Melchi,</HI> and the Inhabitants dig &s;o many of the&s;e Roots, that they &s;end yearly &s;everal Che&s;ts-full into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they u&s;e them (as I am informed) very frequently in Pains of their Backs, and all other accidental Pains. As far as I can &s;ee, when I look upon the Leaves, I reckon it to be the third &s;ort of <HI>Daucus</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> A little lower, as you come to the plow'd Fields, I found al&s;o the &s;econd kind of <HI>Chondrilla</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> with round Roots of a &s;mooth and dark-yellowi&s;h colour, perhaps at the top half an inch thick, and five or eight long, whereon at the end where it is thinne&s;t, hangs another round Root of the bigne&s;s of a Che&s;tnut, which are &s;o full of Milk, that they are ready to crack; at top, where it is divided into three parts, &s;prout out many long and &s;mall Gra&s;s Leaves together, which lye flat upon the Ground; between them come out yellow Flowers like unto the&s;e of <HI>auricula muris,</HI> each whereof hath its peculiar Stalk.</P>
<P>Not far from it, yet in rougher and &s;tonier Ground, groweth another <HI>Chondrilla,</HI> which is like unto that former in all parts, only the Leaves thereof are broader, and more woolly, and of an A&s;h-colour, very like unto the <HI>Holo|&s;tium</HI> of <HI>Montpellier.</HI> As you go to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Garden, (about a &s;mall mile from the Town) at the Road, I found a good many Plants, <HI>viz. Draba Dio&s;c.</HI> call'd <HI>Orobanche Halinu, Spina &s;ol&s;titialis,</HI> a kind of <HI>Carduus Mariae</HI>; Wild Cucumbers, by them called <HI>Adiural hamar; Xyphium, Peplium, Heliotropium tri coccum Caroli Clu&s;ii,</HI> and al&s;o his <HI>Paronychia Hi&s;panica,</HI> and his third <HI>Lichnis,</HI> with pale and red purple-colou|red
<PB N="107" REF="69">
Flowers; <HI>Coris Mathi.</HI> with yellow Flowers; two delicate &s;orts of <HI>Geraniums</HI>; and upon old Walls I found a little <HI>Rauckel,</HI> with pale-colour'd Flowers, <HI>Umbilicus Veneris,</HI> and a great many more. I cannot leave unmentioned tho&s;e that are growing round about in the Fields, and chiefly among&s;t them a <HI>Medica,</HI> with di&s;&s;ected trifoliated Leaves; and many more, whereof &s;ome have long and &s;traight, and others many bended Pods, in a clu&s;ter together. I al&s;o found one with many white and hoary Heads, which looked almo&s;t like unto <HI>Lagopodium,</HI> and another little one with green-colour'd Pods pre&s;&s;ed together, &s;o long and broad as tho&s;e of <HI>Senna,</HI> which were a great Ornament to the whole Plant. And al&s;o thereabout are found many &s;orts of Corn-flowers, quite differing from ours: <HI>Papaver erratic,</HI> in their Language called <HI>Schuck,</HI> of which they make a Con&s;erve with Sugar, and u&s;e it in Coughs; <HI>Papaver cor|niculatum</HI> with &s;tately purple Flowers. I found al&s;o there <HI>Eryngium,</HI> with blewi&s;h Tops and &s;tarred Heads: Two &s;orts of <HI>Henbane,</HI> whereof one that groweth in the Fields hath red and pur|ple-colour'd Flowers, the other which I found in the Town upon the old Walls had white ones, by the Latines call'd <HI>Apollinaris.</HI> Much thereabout, in the Corn, grew the le&s;s <HI>Melam|pyrum,</HI> by them called <HI>Papone&s;ck,</HI> which at the top beareth thick yellow flowers, very like unto the <HI>Melampyrum Tragi; Item</HI> the &s;econd kind of <HI>Wild Cumin,</HI> with yellow flowers, and long ben|ded pods: <HI>Poterion Math.</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Mega&s;ac,</HI> which they &s;tick up in their Chambers, to keep them from being bewitch'd. A delicate &s;ort of <HI>Horminum,</HI> with &s;mall woolly and di&s;&s;ected leaves, a Garden-Cypre&s;s with
<PB N="108" REF="70">
gold-colour'd flowers: <HI>Seabio&s;a, Anchu&s;a,</HI> and a <HI>Salvia,</HI> which hath many roundi&s;h leaves, and about their &s;quare &s;talks grow purple-colour'd Bells, wherein is its black Seed, like unto that of <HI>Meli&s;&s;a Molucca,</HI> whereof I have made men|tion above. In the Corn al&s;o groweth <HI>Leontope|talon,</HI> in their Language <HI>A&s;lab,</HI> with its brown-colour'd round Root, and large Leaves, which are roundi&s;h, and very near divided like unto the&s;e of our <HI>Paeonia</HI>; the Stalk hath at the top, which is about a foot high, and hollow, more Twiggs, whereof the point of each of them bea|reth &s;everal &s;mall purple and yellow Flowers, which make roundi&s;h Bladders, that contain one, two, and &s;ometimes three Seeds, the Chil|dren u&s;e to play their Tricks with them as they do with the Flowers of <HI>Papaver erraticum</HI> in our Country. The great Roots they brui&s;e, and rub with it Spots in Cloaths, which they (as they &s;ay) draw out immediately.</P>
<P>By the&s;e in the Corn groweth al&s;o the true <HI>Chry&s;ogonum</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> which is as high as the former, and al&s;o in Flowers, Stalks, and roun|di&s;h Root (which is redder within) very like it, only the Stalk is &s;lenderer, and hath more and longer by-&s;hoots, or <HI>germina,</HI> at the end whereof you &s;ee &s;tately yellow Flowers, &s;o that it is thicker, and more &s;priggy than the other: Its pennated Leaves (whereof there are com|monly four that come from the Root with long foot-&s;talks almo&s;t as &s;lender as a Thread) lye clo&s;e to the Ground, as you may ea&s;ily imagin, and have every one their Ribs, two and two Leaves growing together on each &s;ide, one after another, &s;o that four of them &s;tand together in a cro&s;s; they are darki&s;h green, and at the out &s;ide, where they are broader, very like unto

Oaken leaves. Now, as the&s;e and others, that grow in the&s;e Countries, are as yet very little known, &s;o may al&s;o the following, that groweth in plowed Fields, be reckoned among the un|known, which is very like unto the <HI>Lycop&s;is</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI> for which, in my opinion, it ought to be taken.</P>
<P>This Plant hath a red Coat, and a &s;traight Stalk about two foot high, from whence round about below &s;pread them&s;elves many &s;trong and rough Leaves, in a circle, as if it were from one center; not unlike the wild Buglo&s;s, they de|crea&s;e a little by degrees, as they grow higher and higher: Out of each of them, clo&s;e to the Stalk, &s;prouts out many Twigs, with their pe|culiar &s;mall Leaves, as you &s;ee in <HI>Echium</HI>; be|tween them &s;hoot out very tender purple-colour'd Flowers, which are whole within, and divided into &s;ix &s;mall or longi&s;h Leaves, almo&s;t like unto the&s;e of the <HI>Caryophillus montanus.</HI> In the beginning of <HI>February</HI> I have &s;een &s;everal Sorts of <HI>Hyacinths,</HI> and the <HI>Oriental</HI> one in the greate&s;t quantity, which they call <HI>Zumbel</HI> in their Language. In <HI>April</HI> I &s;aw another very delicate one, known to them by the name <HI>Ayur,</HI> with long and very &s;mall Leaves of our <HI>Philangium</HI>; it groweth pretty high, and beareth at the top four Stalky Flowers; the Leaves thereof are very like in &s;hape and colour unto the three Leaves that &s;tand up in our <HI>Flower de luce</HI>; the Root is very like to that of a <HI>Tulip,</HI> whereof I have al&s;o &s;een a great number in the&s;e Grounds of all &s;orts of colours. I have al&s;o found &s;ome Dai&s;ies like unto our own, and al&s;o another &s;ort of them with nine or ten white Saffron-flowers, which &s;prout &s;ooner in the Spring in the Corn, not &s;o bare as ours, but be|tween
<PB N="110" REF="71">
the Leaves. The Leaves are pretty thick, but narrower, longer, and narrower pointed than the before-mentioned: They al&s;o &s;pread more about upon the Ground, and come from a white Coat with a brown-red Skin, &s;urrounded and divided in the middle, it is called <HI>Ku&s;an</HI> in their Tongue, but by &s;ome others it is &s;till cal|led <HI>Surugen.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e and a great many more &s;trange Herbs have I found, but becau&s;e they were unknown to me, I forbear to mention any more of them. But yet I cannot but de&s;cribe to you one more, for the taking of which I and my two Comrades fell into great danger, as we often did, both of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> which needs not all to be re|lated here: This is called by the Inhabitants <HI>Rha&s;ut,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Rumigi</HI>; it hath a &s;trong, yet unplea&s;ant &s;avour, and about four &s;talks of a whiti&s;h colour, and &s;o tender towards the Root, and &s;o &s;mall as a Packthread, whereon at each &s;ide grow &s;even or eight tender a&s;h-colour'd Leaves one again&s;t the other, di&s;tributed like un|to tho&s;e of <HI>O&s;mond-Royal,</HI> only they have round Ears towards the St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lk, like unto the &s;mall <HI>Sage,</HI> and between the lowermo&s;t, which are a little more di&s;tant, Flowers like unto our <HI>Ari&s;tolochia,</HI> yet a great deal bigger, of a more browni&s;h co|lour, and hanging on longer Stalks. The Root &s;triketh very deep, and is very like unto our <HI>Pel|litory,</HI> of a drying quality, and &s;omewhat hot, as the bitter ta&s;te intimates. When I was bu&s;ie about this tender Plant, and &s;trove to get it out whole, which took me up the more time, be|cau&s;e I had no proper Tools by me, a <HI>Turk</HI> well armed came galloping upon us, to &s;ee what we were doing; but when we perceived him to be fuddled, and that he earne&s;tly &s;et upon us, to
<PB N="111" REF="71">
make booty of us, each of us gave him, accor|ding to his own de&s;ire (&s;eeing that he would not leave us without it) &s;omething, that &s;o we might get rid of him, &s;o he rode away very well plea&s;ed out of our &s;ight, &s;o that we took no fur|ther care of him. But before I could get the Root quite out, he came back again with full &s;peed upon us, &s;o I bid my Comrades to run to the next Olive-Trees, and I would follow them pre&s;ently; but when I &s;aw him come pretty near me, and found I could not get the Plant whole, I pulled it up as well as I could, and &s;o ran to my Companions. But when I came to the Olive-trees, I found they were ran &s;everal Olive-trees further, which &s;tand row by row, and found my &s;elf quite alone and de&s;titute, and that I mu&s;t defend my &s;elf behind the Tree; &s;o he came down upon me with his Cymeter drawn, and fetch'd one blow after the other at me, which I &s;till declined running from one &s;ide of the Tree to the other, &s;o that they went into the Tree and mangled it mightily. In the mean time defending my &s;elf thus unarmed again&s;t him, I took a Re&s;olution, that if he &s;hould take hold of his Bow and Arrow to &s;hoot at me, which he could not do except he left his Cyme|ter, to run in upon him, and &s;truggle with him: But this Fight during very long, and perhaps his Anger did not give him leave to think of it, I found out another way (knowing them to be very covetous) to make my &s;elf free again with a piece of <HI>Money,</HI> and to give him a &s;mall Silver piece, (which in their Language they call <HI>Saict,</HI> worth about three-pence or a Groat) &s;o <HI>pulled</HI> it out, and &s;hew'd it him <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;tanding be|hind the Tree: As &s;oon as he &s;aw it he gave
<PB N="112" REF="72">
over, and beckened to me to give it him, &s;o I &s;tepp'd to him, and when I reached it to him, he took it. But my Table-book fell out of my Pocket when I pulled out the Money, upon the Ground, wherein I had recorded many things, which when he &s;aw, he would have it al&s;o, but I refu&s;ing it, he grew mad, and began to renew the &s;ame Game again; then I repen|ted that I did not di&s;mount him when I gave him the Money; yet I con&s;ider'd, that if I &s;hould have done him a Mi&s;chief, as he de&s;er|ved, yet although I had never &s;o good a Cau&s;e, I was &s;ure I mu&s;t be ca&s;t, and perhaps come to a greater mi&s;chief and hurt; &s;o I gave him it, and after he had received it, he was pacified and rode away.</P>
<P>But to come to my former purpo&s;e again, I found about the River the other <HI>Tragium Dio&s;c.</HI> in the ploughed Grounds, and afterwards al&s;o in abundance upon the Hill, but generally in moi&s;t places, near to the Spring that runs down the Hill: Its Root is whiti&s;h, pretty long and &s;lender, from thence &s;pread them&s;elves &s;ome woody Stalks not above a little finger long, whereon grew towards the top many Leaves to|gether, which were long, and had of each &s;ide of their rib &s;mall Leaves, one oppo&s;ite to the other, which were (ju&s;t like the <HI>Tricho|manes</HI>) divided, only &s;omewhat longer, about the bigne&s;s of the&s;e of <HI>A&s;plenium,</HI> and are (as they) delicately green within, but without, and again&s;t the Ground, of an A&s;h-colour, and woolly, chiefly the &s;mall ones, that are ju&s;t &s;prouting out between the others. Out of the&s;e fir&s;t-mentioned Stems come fir&s;t naked long Stalks, upon which grow, at the top,
<PB N="113" REF="72">
Violet-brown Flowers clo&s;e together, as if it was an Ear of Corn: The Inhabitants call it <HI>Secudes,</HI> and &s;o did the ancient <HI>Arabians,</HI> chiefly <HI>Avicen.</HI> in the 679th Chapter, where he al&s;o attributeth this Vertue, that it is very proper in the Bloody-flux.</P>
<P>In their Gardens the <HI>Turks</HI> love to rai&s;e all &s;orts of Flowers, wherein they take great de|light, and u&s;e to put them on their Turbant, &s;o I could &s;ee the fine Plants that blow one after another, daily, without trouble. In <HI>December</HI> I &s;aw our Violets, with dark-brown and white Flowers, whereof they gave me in that Sea&s;on &s;everal No&s;egays. Then came the <HI>Tulips, Hya|cinths, Narci&s;&s;ies,</HI> which they &s;till name by the old name <HI>Nergis.</HI> Before all other, I &s;aw a rare kind with a double yellow Flower, called <HI>Mo|daph,</HI> and a &s;trange <HI>Convolvulus hederae foliis,</HI> with great purple Flowers, whereout grew Seed-ve&s;|&s;els, as you &s;ee in the new <HI>Harmala,</HI> with three di&s;tinct <HI>Cap&s;ula</HI>'s, wherein is kept its black Seed, to which they attribute the vertue of eva|cuating tough Slime. This is found &s;ometimes in Gardens, and by the Inhabitants called <HI>Ha|&s;ni&s;ca,</HI> and the <HI>Per&s;ians Acafra,</HI> and <HI>Serapio,</HI> Chapt. 273. <HI>Habalnil;</HI> the <HI>Latines, Granum In|dicum,</HI> and <HI>Carthamus Indicus</HI>; and he that hath a mind to know more of it, let him look into the Author him&s;elf, in the above-mentioned place, in the 306th Chapter of <HI>Avicen.</HI> and the 208th of <HI>Rha&s;es.</HI> I al&s;o found in their Gardens <HI>Balm, Ba&s;il,</HI> and a fine &s;ort of <HI>Amaranthus,</HI> which for his colour-&s;ake may be called <HI>Sym|phonia Plinii,</HI> and therefore called Parrots Fea|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="73">I cannot forbear, before I conclude, to men|tion &s;ome which I found here and there in the <HI>Batzars,</HI> and among them a &s;trange &s;ort of Lil|lies, which as I am told grow in &s;unny, moory, mo&s;&s;y, and moi&s;t places; whereon groweth a long Stalk of the &s;ame colour and thickne&s;s of ours, only a great deal broader, but broade&s;t of all at top, where it is about three fingers broad, &s;o that it is like unto a Spatula that is painted at one end: On this Stalk grow at each &s;ide &s;e|veral tender Leaves, which are pretty long, but very &s;mall and pointed, and at the top thereof &s;ome white Flowers like unto ours. When I was thinking of this at &s;everal times, what they were called by the Ancients, it came into my mind, that I had read of them in <HI>Theophra&s;tus, lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 9. and I really believe it to be the &s;ame. But whereas <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> writes in the quoted place, that they do not touch the Ground, I can &s;ay nothing to it, for I never &s;aw any of them growing. They have al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall Roots to &s;ell, called <HI>Mamirani tchini,</HI> good for Eyes, as they &s;ay; they are yellowi&s;h like <HI>Curcuma,</HI> but a good deal longer, and thin|ner, and knotted, and very like unto our <HI>Po|ligonatum,</HI> and may be e&s;teemed to be the true <HI>Mamican,</HI> whereof <HI>Rha&s;es</HI> maketh mention in &s;everal places. There is al&s;o among others brought a great quantity of the Juice of <HI>Scam|mony,</HI> that is &s;till very &s;oft, it cometh in Lea|thern Bags from out of the Country, and &s;o it's &s;old to our Merchants in their <HI>Fondiques</HI>; but tho&s;e that buy it mu&s;t have a great care (becau&s;e it is often adulterated) that they be not cheated. There is al&s;o a good deal of the Juice, by the Apothecaries called <HI>Opium,</HI> and
<PB N="115" REF="73">
by the Inhabitants <HI>Ofinn,</HI> which the <HI>Turks, Moors,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and other Nations take in|wardly, not only in War, at the time when they go to fight their Enemies, to make them couragious and valiant, but al&s;o in time of Peace, to drive away Melancholy and Care, or at lea&s;t to ea&s;e it. Their religious People make al&s;o u&s;e of it, but above all the re&s;t the <HI>Deruis,</HI> and take &s;o much of it, that it maketh them pre&s;ently drow&s;ie, and without con&s;idera|tion, that when, after their barbarous and &s;illy way, they cut, &s;la&s;h, or burn them&s;elves, they may feel le&s;s &s;mart or pain. If any one hath &s;o begun to make u&s;e of it, (they take about the quantity of a large Pea at a time) they cannot well leave it off again, except they have a mind to throw them&s;elves into a Sickne&s;s or other Inconveniencies: For, as they confe&s;s them|&s;elves, that if they omit taking of it, they find them&s;elves very ill in their Bodies. <HI>Opium</HI> is commonly taken from the white Poppy-heads, in their Language called <HI>Ca&s;ca&s;ch,</HI> wherein they cut (when they are young and tender) a &s;piral or winding-circle round about it from top to bottom, one under the other; out of tho&s;e runs &s;ome Milk, which they let be there until it groweth thick, then they gather it and make it into Balls, like unto our perfumed Soap-balls. Being that the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e this <HI>Opium</HI> &s;o com|monly, it happens &s;ometimes that they take &s;o much of it, that it is very dangerous; wherefore they have an Antidote (as I was in|formed) that is the Root <HI>A&s;lab</HI> (whereof I have made mention before) which they give to bring them to rights again.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="74">I found al&s;o in the great <HI>Batzars</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>Alga</HI> &s;old in their Shops, which was dark-red, and therefore very u&s;eful for Dyers; it had Stalks of the thickne&s;s of a Finger, and was &s;urrounded with &s;everal thin Scales, or rather Leaves, and round: Wherefore it may be ta|ken to be a <HI>Saderva</HI> Serap. and Herb <HI>Alargi|van</HI> of <HI>Andreas Bellunen&s;is,</HI> whereof he maketh mention in his <HI>Index,</HI> where he interpreteth the <HI>Arabian</HI> words.

Wherefore <HI>Dio&s;corid.</HI> bids us (if we will not be impo&s;ed upon) to pick out the big|ger and &s;moother, with its noble Seed, and to leave the &s;mall. This Stalk, which I found about the length of a Finger, is almo&s;t of the colour of the Bark of the Cinnamon-tree, and al&s;o in its acrimony and good odour (although it was old) &s;till very &s;trong. At the top had

been &s;everal woody Stalks, clo&s;e to one another, whereon I believe had been the Flowers and Seeds. But the Twigs of the other &s;ort, which are crack'd and bended, are of a brown colour, which at the top divide them&s;elves into other le&s;s ones, like a Tree, whereon grow &s;everal Stalks, with little Heads like unto the <HI>Ma&s;aron,</HI> or <HI>Marum Syriacum</HI> from <HI>Crete,</HI> wherein is no great &s;trength nor odour.</P>

<P><HI>How I departed from</HI> Halepo <HI>to the Famous City of</HI> Bir, <HI>and how I &s;ailed from thence on the</HI> Euphrates <HI>to old</HI> Babylon.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter I had &s;tay'd a good while in <HI>Halepo,</HI> and had &s;een and under&s;tood the Trade and Merchan|dices of the Inhabitants, together with that of all the other Nations, <HI>viz.

<PB N="122" REF="77">
ob&s;erved and under&s;tood their Manners and Cu&s;toms, and had al&s;o Collected a fine parcel of foreign and unde|&s;cribed Plants; I re&s;olved to go farther Ea&s;tward into <HI>Me&s;opotamia, A&s;&s;yria,</HI> and <HI>Babylonia,</HI> &amp;c. as the anci|ente&s;t and mo&s;t fruitful Countries that ever were, where the anciente&s;t People, and the mo&s;t Potent Mo|narchs did inhabit. But the&s;e Countries lying far off, and the Way that leadeth thither, pa&s;&s;ing through va&s;t De&s;arts and Wilderne&s;&s;es, and therefore the Voyage be|ing &s;o much the more difficult and dangerous to at|tempt and accompli&s;h; I fir&s;t look'd out for a tru&s;ty Companion, to take as my A&s;&s;i&s;tant, and met pre|&s;ently with an experienced <HI>Dutchman,</HI> that had lived a great while in <HI>Halepo,</HI> who granted my reque&s;t (be|ing as de&s;irous to go this Voyage as my &s;elf) to go along with me. We agreed pre&s;ently, and began to con&s;ider, which was our be&s;t Way to take. But that we being Strangers, might not be taken to be Vaga|bonds or Spies (they being very &s;u&s;picious) from whence they might pre&s;ently take occa&s;ion (as the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e to do) to lay great <HI>Avarias,</HI> or unju&s;t Taxes, upon us, which the Chri&s;tians that deal to the&s;e Parts, have of|ten to their great Lo&s;s and Damage experienced; we did con&s;ider, and found, that the Trading here was very great, &s;o that they did not only deal from hence, into <HI>Armenia, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> (for from thence come the Caravans through <HI>Natolia,</HI> in about a Months time) but al&s;o very much into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India:</HI> Where|fore we thought be&s;t to profe&s;s our &s;elves Merchants, that &s;o we might Travel the more &s;afely with other Merchants, in order thereto, to buy &s;ome Merchandices, that would Sell in tho&s;e Places, and to carry them a|long with us. That we might put this in execution, my formerly mentioned Friend <HI>Hans &V;lrich Raft,</HI> from <HI>&V;lm,</HI> took great Pains to furni&s;h me at my De|&s;ire and Reque&s;t, with &s;everal fit Commodities for tho&s;e Places, upon account of my Patron, Mr. <HI>Melchior Manlich,</HI> which I got pack'd up immediately, to go with them to the Famous City <HI>Bagdet,</HI> &s;ituated upon the <HI>Tigris,</HI> where is a great Staple and Depo&s;ition of Merchandices that are to go farther for <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India.</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="77">
But &s;eeing that &s;eldom any Merchants go from <HI>Ha|lepo</HI> further into the&s;e Countries, &s;o that our Habits are very rarely &s;een there; we cloathed our &s;elves as is u&s;ual, in the common <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit (that every body might not pre&s;ently look upon us as Strangers); fir&s;t, we had long blue <HI>Cabans,</HI> which are button'd before quite down, and cut out about the Neck, not unlike to tho&s;e of the <HI>Armenians</HI>; and white <HI>Drawers</HI> made of Cotton, that hung down to our Ankles, and were drawn in, and tied about our Bodies, and al&s;o Shirts after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion, and without Collars. We al&s;o fitted our &s;elves with white Turbants with a blue Brim, &s;uch as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> u&s;ually wear, and put on yellow Shooes which were painted, before guarded with Nails, and with Hor&s;e Shooes behind. Be&s;ides this we put on a kind of a Frock, made of a certain cour&s;e Stuff called <HI>Meska</HI> in their Language, which is common among the <HI>Moors.</HI> They are generally made of Goats and A&s;&s;es Hair, pretty nar|row, without Sleeves, and &s;hort, reaching only to our Knees. But the&s;e Stuffs being not all alike, the fine&s;t thereof (chiefly that which is &s;triped white and black) is taken for Cloaths; and the cour&s;er for Tents and Portmantles, wherein they carry their Provi&s;ion through the De&s;arts, and al&s;o keep their Camels and Mules meat, hanging it about their Necks. This puts me in mind of the plain cloathing which the ancient Inhabitants of the&s;e Countries, (chiefly the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> when they mourned for their decea&s;ed Relations, or when they repented of their committed Iniquities, and turned from them, and prayed God to forgive them their ac|cumulated Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions) u&s;ed to put on, as we read in the 37th. Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> where <HI>Jacob</HI> lamented the Death of his Son <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>; and in the Book of the Prophet <HI>Jonas,</HI> of the <HI>Ninevites,</HI> who believing the Prophet's Words, denouncing their De&s;truction within Forty Days, and repenting of their Sins, put on Sack|cloth, and prayed to God for forgivene&s;s. The like we read of the King and Prophet <HI>David,</HI> after he had numbred his People. <HI>Item,</HI> in the 10th. Chapter of <HI>Luke</HI> and other places, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they put on Sackcloth and did repent in A&s;hes. It is therefore very probable,
<PB N="124" REF="78">
that tho&s;e were very like unto them that are &s;till in u&s;e.</P>
<P>When we had thus accoutred our &s;elves for the Voyage, and provided us with all Nece&s;&s;aries, <HI>viz.</HI> Cloths, Merchandices, Provi&s;ion of Biskets and Drink, and did &s;tay only for &s;ome Fellow-travellers, we were &s;till doubtful whether it were more convenient for us to go by Land with <HI>Caravans,</HI> which go from hence and <HI>Da|ma&s;cus</HI> very &s;trong to <HI>Bagdet,</HI> through great Sands and De&s;arts in Fifty Days, more or le&s;s, according as the Weather proveth: Or, whether we &s;hould go by Water, either upon the <HI>Tigris</HI> or the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> there being good Opportunity to go in Company with others. But it happening that we met with &s;ome <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants Servants that did live at <HI>Halepo,</HI> who were al&s;o provided with Goods, and had a mind to go into the &s;ame Countries, we did readily embrace this Opportunity, partly becau&s;e they under&s;tood the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, which two are chiefly &s;poken in <HI>Syria,</HI> and partly becau&s;e &s;ome of them had been four times al|ready in the <HI>Indies</HI>; wherefore we put our Goods to theirs, and loaded a great many Camels together, to deliver them to us at <HI>Bir,</HI> to &s;hip them there upon the <HI>Euphrates</HI>; And that we might pa&s;s every where in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, we took a Pa&s;s from the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and <HI>Cadi,</HI> and &s;o we began our Travels to <HI>Bir,</HI> di&s;tant Three Days Journey, the 13th. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> Anno 74. By the way we were &s;o &s;trange to one another, that in our new Fa&s;hioned Cloaths we did hardly know one another among them all. After we had the fir&s;t Day a rough Road, and travelled through many De&s;arts and uninhabited Places, we reached at Night a little Vil|lage, where we encamped and pitched our Tents. We put all our Packs in a circle round about us, and with|out them our Bea&s;ts (as it is u&s;ual in great <HI>Caravans</HI>) to defend us from the A&s;&s;aults of the <HI>Moors</HI> in the Night. A little after Midnight we heard a great <HI>Ca|ravan</HI> of many Camels and A&s;&s;es to go by, very near to us, which after it was pa&s;&s;ed, we broke al&s;o up and followed them; when the Day Light appeared, we &s;aw &s;everal plow'd Fields more than the Day before, and
<PB N="125" REF="78">
al&s;o here and there in &s;ome plea&s;ant Places many Tents of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> which were fixed together as it were in a Camp; ranged very orderly into Streets. After we had that Morning travelled very hard, &s;o that our Bea&s;ts under their heavy Loads began to be tired in the great Heat, we re&s;ted behind a little Chapel, to refre&s;h our &s;elves, and to feed our Camels; in the mean time &s;ome poor Women came down from the High-lands to us to gather the Dung of our Camels to burn it in|&s;tead of Wood, whereof they were in great want. When the great Heat was over, and we had &s;taid there for two Hours, we went on again, and came before it was Night, to a little Village lying in a Valley, near which upon the Height, the <HI>Arabians</HI> had formed a great Camp: We went up to them, and pitched our Tents in the Plain by them, and kept as above&s;aid a good Watch. They came quickly to us, &s;poke kindly to us, and their Wives brought us Water and good Milk; but after we &s;aw that they were very naked and hungry, and in their &s;hape like to our <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> we did not tru&s;t them at all, but kept a very good Watch all that Night. The&s;e are Vagabond People, that are u&s;ed to Idlene&s;s from their Infancy, and will rather endure Hun|ger, Heat and Cold, than get any thing by their Handy-work, or Till the Fields, or Plant Garden-herbs for their Maintenance, although they might do it in &s;everal fruitful Places in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. So you find here a great Number of them by the &s;ides of the&s;e &s;andy De&s;arts, that have no where any Habita|tion, but live in their Tents like as the Bea&s;ts do in Caves, and go like unto the <HI>Gyp&s;ies</HI> from place to place, until they light on one, where they may live a great while with their Cattle, and when all is eat up, want dri|veth them from thence, to look out for another.</P>
<P>On the 15th. early before break of Day, we were up in the cool of the Day, with an intention to reach to <HI>Bir</HI> that Night, but our Camels were grown &s;o faint by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heat and the great Burthens, that they fell down &s;everal times, wherefore we look|ed out for a convenient place where we might &s;tay all Night, and found at la&s;t a Village near which we
<PB N="126" REF="79">
pitched our Tents, eat &s;ome Gourds and Biskets, and &s;o went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Two Hours before break of the Day, we began our Journey again, and came early in the Morning to the great River called <HI>Euphrates,</HI> we went over with our Goods and Chattel, and fixed our Tents before the Town near the River, on the other &s;ide, to &s;tay for a Barge that was to come from <HI>Armenia,</HI> to go from thence to <HI>Babylon,</HI> which is now called <HI>Felugo.</HI> By the way I &s;aw no Herbs of any worth, except the <HI>Galega,</HI> in our Language called Goats-rue, which grew plenti|fully on the dry Heaths; and near to the Road, the fir&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Apocynum,</HI> by us called Dogs-bane, very like unto the great Celandine in its Leaves and Pods: I al&s;o &s;aw whole acres of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Corn called <HI>Se&s;amo,</HI> and o|thers all &s;own with Cotton, and al&s;o a kind of <HI>E&s;ula,</HI> very full of Milk, wherewith the fallow Grounds were &s;o filled up, that at a di&s;tance, you would have taken it for good Corn. Seeing that the <HI>Scammony</HI> that u&s;es to be brought to <HI>Halepo,</HI> is wont &s;ometime to be very &s;harp, therefore it may very well be, that they adul|terate it with this <HI>E&s;ula.</HI> Near the Town grew abun|dance of <HI>Acacia,</HI> called <HI>Schack</HI> and <HI>Schamuck,</HI> as is a|bove mentioned, which are here in Stem and Fruit, greater and larger than ever I &s;aw any any where. The Town <HI>Bir</HI> is &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the great Ri|ver <HI>Euphrates</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> near the high Hill <HI>Taurus,</HI> ju&s;t like <HI>Tripolis</HI> near the <HI>Libanus,</HI> or our <HI>Lo&s;anna</HI> on our <HI>Alps</HI>: It is neither big nor &s;trong, but pretty well defended by a Ca&s;tle that lyeth on a high Rock above the River, not ea&s;ily to be taken. There is a very plea|&s;ant Country round about it, and very fruitful, which (chiefly on this &s;ide of the River where it is plain) is very well Tilled and Sown with Corn (which they did ju&s;t thra&s;h out when we came, with little Waggons drawn by Oxen) and here and there are very good Villages. But beyond the River it is more hilly, which kind of Ground extends it &s;elf a great way towards the Ea&s;t, and divideth <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI> It is at the top very rough and bare; nothing but Bu|&s;hes and Herbs to be &s;een there; wherefore abundance
<PB N="127" REF="79">
of Bea&s;ts, chiefly Lambs and Goats, are daily brought down, which are carried over the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and &s;o driven to <HI>Halepo</HI> and other adjacent places. This Ri|ver where it runs by the Town is about a Mile broad, and &s;o deep that it is not ea&s;y to make a Bridge over it: Yet becau&s;e it hath not a &s;wift Current in that place, it is not very dangerous to Sail on it, except where it enlargeth it &s;elf (as it doth in great De&s;arts) or el&s;e where it divideth it &s;elf into &s;everal Branches, &s;o that the Water-men do not know, which is the be&s;t way for them to take; wherefore the Merchants that have a mind to come quicker and with le&s;s Pains to <HI>Bagdet</HI> with their Merchandices, carry them by Land to <HI>Orpha,</HI> to the Famous Town of <HI>Carahmet,</HI> which lyeth Six Days further towards the Ea&s;t, on the Bor|ders of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> and <HI>Media,</HI> upon the rapid River <HI>Tigris,</HI> where is a great Depo&s;ition of Merchandices, that are &s;ent from thence to <HI>Ormutz</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> The <HI>Eu|phrates</HI> is continually muddy, and therefore almo&s;t not fit to be drunk, except you let it &s;tand Two or Three Hours, until the Sand and Mud is &s;unk down to the bottom, which &s;ometimes is of the thickne&s;s of an Inch: So that in every Hou&s;e where they have no Wells, all along the River in Towns and Villages, they have &s;everal great Pots which they fill out of the Ri|ver, and let them &s;tand until it be &s;etled, but if they have occa&s;ion to drink of it before, they drink through their Towels.</P>
<P>During the time of our &s;taying there they brought us &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;hes they had caught in the River to Sell, and among the re&s;t one &s;ort called <HI>Geirigi,</HI> which in their Shape and Scales were very like unto <HI>Carps,</HI> only they were not &s;o thick in the Belly, but a great deal longer and bigger, &s;o that &s;ometimes one of them did weigh three Rotula's of their Weight, which is about Seventeen or Eighteen of our Pounds. They are very delicate and good to eat, and &s;o cheap, that we could buy one for one <HI>Medin,</HI> in our Money worth a|bout three Pence. To catch the&s;e, our Ship's Crew flung out oftentimes &s;ome Pellets made up with <HI>Coc|culus Indic</HI>; (which Fruit is named by them <HI>Deam Sa|mec</HI>)
<PB N="128" REF="80">
and pre&s;ently after &s;ome of the Fi&s;h flung them|&s;elves up at the top of the Water, whereupon they jum|ped out of the Ship, to catch them, and to carry them a-&s;hoar. I &s;aw al&s;o a peculiar &s;ort of Vultures, which were &s;o tame, that they did not only &s;it very thick upon the Hou&s;es, but they &s;at down in the Street be|fore all the People without any fear, they are more of an A&s;hen Colour than ours, but for bigne&s;s, height and the re&s;t, exactly like unto them. Be&s;ides the&s;e there was another &s;ort of them, that were &s;omething bigger, and of a lighter Colour than the former, and had &s;ome black at the Ends of their Wings like unto our <HI>Storks.</HI> They eat al&s;o Carrion, and Meat, and are &s;omewhat wilder, wherefore they may be affirmed to be the very &s;ame that <HI>Rha&s;is</HI> called <HI>Gyuni,</HI> and <HI>Avicenn, Rachame.</HI> During the time that we &s;taid there, a <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> was &s;ent hither by the <HI>Turki&s;h Sultan,</HI> with &s;ome hundred <HI>Spa|hi's,</HI> pretty well armed, for his Ma&s;ter did intend to make War with the <HI>Tru&s;ci,</HI> that &s;o he might de|fend the Confines of <HI>Syria, Me&s;opotamia,</HI> and <HI>Ar|menia,</HI> &amp;c. from being a&s;&s;aulted by them, and to keep every thing &s;ecure. The <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> live on the Mountain of <HI>Libanus,</HI> and pretend to be the Off &s;pring of tho&s;e People that under <HI>Godfrey de Bouillon</HI> did po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves again of the Land of Promi&s;e. They are &s;ince &s;o much encrea&s;ed, that they are able to bring into the Field Sixty Thou&s;and (mo&s;t of which are very good Gunners) which if occa&s;ion be, they can bring toge|ther in a &s;hort time. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> &s;eeing that they encrea&s;ed daily, &s;o that he did fear they would be in time too great for him, to prevent this (as then the common Di&s;cour&s;e went) and to &s;ubdue them, and bring them under his Yoke, did &s;ummon &s;ome <HI>Ba|&s;haws</HI> and <HI>Sangiacs,</HI> chiefly him of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to bring together a great Army, to fall upon them. But which way he did beat them, and how he encroach|ed upon them, I &s;hall (becau&s;e I did for this time, during my Travels, hear no more of it) relate more largely after my return. The <HI>Spahi's</HI> which came with the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> took (becau&s;e they would not be Idle) their Diver&s;ion in Running, Shooting with Arrows,
<PB N="129" REF="80">
and in Fencing, or Cudgel-playing, and &s;ometimes the Country People came in with them, and played with them, but not in &s;o many &s;orts of Arms as the Fencing-Ma&s;ters do in our Country, <HI>viz.</HI> with Daggers, Swords or Halbarts, for the&s;e are not in fa&s;hion in tho&s;e Coun|tries. They take in&s;tead thereof only Cudgels, with them they approach towards one another three times, yet not with &s;uch flouri&s;hes and neatne&s;s as our Fen|cers do before they begin, for their long Cloaths hinder them. In their left hand they have a Buckler which is about a Foot Diameter round, covered with Lea|ther, and &s;tuffed out with Hair; in their right Hand they have a Cudgel, wherewith they &s;trike &s;trait at one another in the fir&s;t bout, as the Boys do in our Country, but in the &s;econd and third bout, they &s;trike cro&s;s-ways, chiefly in the third which is the la&s;t, which they take off cleaverly with their Bucklers; and &s;ome|time they &s;trike at one anothers Legs, but never to hurt one another; when this is done, they turn back and march off. This manner of Fencing is very common in the&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>At length after we had &s;taid a great while, &s;everal Ships did arrive from above, and ours, for which we did &s;tay, among them. So our Patron begun to load, and to fit him&s;elf for our departure: And &s;o did two more that had a mind to go in Company with us. One among them belonging to a <HI>Turk</HI> was laden only with Corn, to carry during the Scarcity (which was oc|ca&s;ioned by the great Heat, and for want of Rain) to <HI>Bagdet.</HI> We al&s;o bought &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits, viz. <HI>Cibebs, Anguria's,</HI> Garlick and Onions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and took al&s;o along with us &s;ome Ground Corn, as is u&s;ual to do in &s;uch Voyages, which with Rice Flower is fit to make Puddings, or to bake Bread of; Honey and other things to &s;erve as Provi&s;ion for our Ship; for we were to travel a great way through many De|&s;arts and Places not inhabited, where nothing was to be had. For there are no Inns upon this River, as upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> or <HI>Danube,</HI> where they dre&s;s Victuals for Travellers again&s;t they come. And that we might have &s;ometimes &s;omething Hot to eat, we provided our|&s;elves
<PB N="130" REF="81">
with &s;everal Cooking Ve&s;&s;els (as is u&s;ual in the&s;e ca&s;es) to dre&s;s our Meat in. But the Ma&s;ter of our Ship &s;till wanting both Men and Merchandices to load his Ship withal, we were forced to &s;tay &s;omewhat longer, for other Merchants which came in a little time from <HI>Halepo</HI> (whereof &s;ome were <HI>Armenians,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> others from <HI>Bagdet</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ora</HI>) to us; with the&s;e al&s;o came into the Ship Four Souldiers that were li&s;ted by the <HI>Turks</HI> to go to <HI>Bagdet,</HI> to rein|force the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> Our Ma&s;ter al&s;o took in &s;ome of their <HI>Jews,</HI> which are wor&s;e than ours, and &s;o we were warned to have a care of them. Be&s;ides all the&s;e we were forced to take in &s;ome of their Re|ligious Men, which had long before begged there|about, for they commonly live by begging, and de&s;ire you to give them &s;omething <HI>Alla hit&s;i,</HI> that is, for God's &s;ake, and yet if they find an Opportunity they will fall upon you and Rob you. They are very ill-favour|ed, idle, and yet very hardy Men, that run about all Countries, and often do a great deal of hurt; where|fore one mu&s;t have e&s;pecial Care of them, chiefly upon the Road. Yet for all this they have in the&s;e Coun|tries very great Privileges; they pretend to great Ho|line&s;s and Devotion, and pray often, and per&s;wade the Vulgar &s;ort of People, that God doth hear their Pray|ers before any others, and grants their de&s;ires, but People do not believe them &s;o readily now, as their Ance&s;tors have done formerly, wherefore they do not re|main long in one place, that their Roguery may not &s;o much appear.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Which way we went into the Ship, and &s;ailed to</HI> Racka; <HI>and how the Son of the King of</HI> Arabia <HI>with his Retinue came to our Ship to demand his Cu&s;toms: What el&s;e we &s;aw by the way, and what we did &s;uffer from the</HI> Arabians <HI>and their Mendicants.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter our Ship as well as the others was &s;ufficiently loaden, and with all Nece&s;&s;aries provided, we went aboard, and began our Voyage in the Name of God, the 30th. Day of <HI>Augu&s;t, Anno</HI> 74. (having &s;tay'd there and lo&s;t Seventeen Days) in the Evening, with an intention to go that Night three Leagues further. But two of our Ships got into a branch of the River, where|of there are &s;everal in the very beginning: Our Water|men took great pains to bring them into the right way again, and &s;tayed for them, which retarded us &s;o long, that we were forced to &s;tay all Night, at a Market-Town, called <HI>Caffra,</HI> which lieth a good League below, on the top of a Hill, where we landed.</P>
<P>The next morning at break of Day, we got in again and in the beginning we went on very fortunately, and began to leave by degrees on our left Hand, the Moun|tain <HI>Taurus,</HI> which extendeth its &s;elf Ea&s;tward, and went more to the right, through the great De&s;arts and Sandy Places of <HI>Arabia,</HI> where that River divideth it &s;elf into &s;everal broad Branches, that the Skippers knew hardly how to &s;teer the right way. When we went on &s;o, thinking of no danger, for the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ship was got already very &s;afe through one of them, the &s;econd (which we followed) &s;tuck upon the Sand, by the ne|glect of their Pilot towards the right, &s;o that it did not only &s;tick there, but took away the Stream from us, which turned their Ship cro&s;s very violently, after &s;uch a manner, that we were forced (becau&s;e we were too
<PB N="132" REF="82">
nigh, and our Ship was in her full running, &s;o that we could turn no way) to fall foul upon it. So ours drove with the Stream upon theirs with that force, that we broke the two uppermo&s;t Boards of their &s;ide; &s;o the Water ran in, and the Ship &s;ank deeper. Our Ship, although it had received no hurt, yet did it not go on, but &s;tuck by the other. Whereupon we began to la|bour hard, removed the Sand below, and made a way to get it clear; after we had half drawn it before the o|ther into the Stream, the Stream drove it &s;o hard again&s;t the other that al&s;o a row and a half of our &s;ide-board were broken, and if it had broken the &s;econd row quite, we had incurred the &s;ame Mi&s;chief and Damage as they. When we were in this Condition, and could not otherwi&s;e think but that we mu&s;t peri&s;h all together, yet our merciful God and Lord did order it &s;o, that we did not only &s;ecure the breach, but came into the right River free and quit before the other Ship, where we did land immediately. After we had recovered our &s;elves a little, we did not delay to a&s;&s;i&s;t the other, but unloaded our Ship, to load theirs into it, and &s;o to land them, which we did with all &s;peed: In the mean time appeared behind the Trees and Tamarisks at each &s;ide a good many <HI>Arabians,</HI> both on Hor&s;e-back and foot, and came &s;o near, that they were not afraid to attack our Guards we had left with our Goods, and to attempt to rob us. But when they found re&s;i&s;tance, and heard &s;everal of our Guns di&s;charged on our &s;ide, they were frighted (for Guns were unknown to them) to that Degree, that they turned their Backs and run away as hard as they could drive. At la&s;t we attemp|ted to draw out the Ship together with &s;ome &s;mall Goods that were &s;till left in it, which &s;ucceeded very well, for when we hoi&s;ted our Sails and drew them on, and wrought with all our might and &s;trength, it yield|ed by Degrees, &s;o that at length we got it quite off, and brought it a-&s;hoar. The lo&s;s of their Merchan|dices, although it was but &s;mall in quantity, yet it was very great in their Silk, Stuffs of <HI>Dama&s;co,</HI> Soap, Sugar, Roots of <HI>Zarneb Melchi,</HI> which is good for the Pain in the Back, as is here before mentioned,
<PB N="133" REF="82">
Figs and Corn, which &s;uffered very much; wherefore they begged of us, that we would be plea&s;ed to &s;tay with them, until they had dried their Goods and mended their Ship, &s;o that they might go along with us more &s;afely through the&s;e De&s;arts, which we granted them readily. During this our Stay, when we were helping them, it fell out that I and one of my Comrades were fal&s;ly accu&s;ed by &s;ome Jews, before &s;ome of their Re|ligious Men, that we were often fudling with the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, which the Jew did on purpo&s;e, to make us Out-landi&s;h Men hated among them (for they do according to their Law not ea&s;ily admit of drinking of Wine) and to di&s;parage us; and this his Intention did &s;ucceed &s;o well that when their Clergy|men did under&s;tand it, they became very angry with us, took our Ve&s;&s;el of Wine, flung it into the River, and drew it upon the Land where they let it run out, which did not well plea&s;e the Souldiers and others, where|fore they took our part, and did give the Jew for it a very &s;evere Reprimand. But as no good Deed remain|eth unrewarded, and no ill one unpuni&s;hed, &s;o it hap|pened here; for the chiefe&s;t of them (which was a <HI>Moor</HI> and of the Order of the <HI>Dervis</HI>) was the next Day puni&s;hed &s;everely, for a frivolous Cau&s;e, whereof I unadvi&s;edly was the occa&s;ion. While our Goods were yet on &s;hoar I got towards Night upon the Balls to &s;tand Centinel, it being my turn; &s;o when I &s;aw one with a Mug full of Water, I de&s;ired him to give me &s;ome to drink, which he was willing to do, and reached me the Mug, I going to take it, trod by chance upon a Fiddle of one of the <HI>Turks</HI> and broke it: Although he had had great occa&s;ion to be angry with me for this, yet (under&s;tanding that I had Giue enough to mend it) he was pre&s;ently quieted and well contented. The next Morning we &s;at together and mended the Fiddle as well as we could; when the <HI>Dervis</HI> &s;aw us bu&s;y about the Fiddle, he was very angry that we did not help to &s;pread out the Merchandices, which we had done already before we began; &s;o he took the Fid|dle, broke it and flung it into the River; then he came back, and pretended to bang us, thinking to have the
<PB N="134" REF="83">
&s;ame Succe&s;s with this as he had with the Wine. But the <HI>Turk</HI> &s;eeing this, took up a good Cudgel that was thrown up by the River, and &s;truck him &s;everal times over his Head and Limbs, that the Blood ran down his Ears and Face, and at length he grew &s;o angry that he went to draw his Scymeter, but before he could, we &s;tept in between them, got them a&s;under, mitigated the bu&s;ine&s;s and appea&s;ed them. So this Saint of theirs looked very di&s;mal in his long and lank black Hair, and had be&s;ides on his Body here and there &s;everal Scars, <HI>viz.</HI> on his Head and Brea&s;t, and above all upon his Arms, which he had cut or burnt him&s;elf, which is u&s;ual to that Order, and other <HI>Turks</HI> to do; which &s;et often on their Fle&s;h burning and red glowing Spangs, or in&s;tead of them Linen Rags, about an Inch thick twi&s;ted very hard together, broad below, and pointed on the top, tapering ju&s;t like unto a Pyramid, which they &s;et on Fire, and let it burn out with a great deal of Patience upon their bare Skin, &s;o long until it is quite con&s;umed and brought to A&s;hes, then they tie it up with Cotton; they al&s;o do the &s;ame &s;ometimes in Rheums of the Head and Eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to dry them up, or to turn them, and to draw them into another place. So I have &s;een &s;everal which have had at lea&s;t Twenty Scars about them, but chiefly on their Arms, (whereof-&s;ome were of the bigne&s;s of a Shilling) be&s;ides Wounds and Scratches they had. But from whence they received this inhumane way (to wound and tor|ment them&s;elves) I do not know, except they had it anciently from the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal,</HI> which u&s;ed to wound them&s;elves with Knives and Lances (as we read in the 18th. Chapter of the 3d&punc; of the <HI>Kings</HI>) un|til the Blood followed. The&s;e Holy Scars and To|kens of their Zeal, I could &s;oon &s;ee and ob&s;erve on this <HI>Moor,</HI> for according to his Order (which is a very great one) he was to wear no Cloths upon his Body neither Winter nor Summer, only a little Scarf to cover his Privy Members withal: In&s;tead of them they put Sheep Skins about them, whereon they lie al&s;o at Night, and &s;o they &s;erve them for Cloaths, Bed and Cover. And &s;o they pretend by their exteriour Ap|parel
<PB N="135" REF="83">
and Behaviour, to great Vertue and Patience, as if they were dead to the World; and to a peculiar Holine&s;s, in praying, fa&s;ting, watching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas they are full of Roguery and Knavery, &s;o that you &s;hall hardly find any like them. With this came al&s;o &s;everal other Religious Men of &s;everal Orders, which were all in &s;everal di&s;tinct Habits, as they are in our Country; among them was a very &s;trong, well &s;et young Man, of the Order of the <HI>Geomaliers</HI> as they call it, which are rather Secular than Clergy|men, they are generally <HI>T&s;chelebys,</HI> that is Gentle|men and rich Per&s;ons, which take great delight in travelling in their young Days, under pretence of Ho|line&s;s, like Pilgrims, at other Peoples Co&s;ts, through &s;everal Countries and Kingdoms, to &s;ee and learn, and to get Experience. This had only a blue Coat on that covered his Body, tied about with a Sa&s;h and Shooes of Sheeps Skins, &s;uch as the <HI>Arabians</HI> in the De&s;arts u&s;e to wear. There went along with us Two more; whereof one had a great Ring in each Ear, about the thickne&s;s of a Finger, and &s;o heavy that it &s;tretched down his ear-laps to his very Shoulders. The&s;e are of the Order called the <HI>Calendriers,</HI> which lead a &s;ober, and ab&s;temious Life before People, wherefore they &s;e|parate them&s;elves from the People, and walk about like Hermits into De&s;arts where-ever they can, to pray there ardently, and to cry out the hours (where|of they have Five every Day) as the Prie&s;ts do from the Steeples, wherefore this Man did &s;eparate him&s;elf as often as he had an Opportunity far from us, that the Bea&s;ts could rather &s;ee and hear him, than we that were in the Ship. When he had done this, he came to us again, and looked &s;o devout|ly as if he had been in a Rapture or Ec&s;ta&s;ie. The other was a <HI>Dervis,</HI> whereof I have made mention before, which al&s;o kept to a very &s;trict Order, for he prayed devoutly and ardently, chiefly at Night after Sun &s;et, at what time two or three more u&s;ed to come to him, and among them &s;ometimes &s;ome of our Merchants; they did &s;tand together in a circle, and &s;o began to pray (as I heard often) fir&s;t very lowly,

then by degrees louder, but when they came to the <HI>Leila Hillalla,</HI> &amp;c. they were &s;o loud, that you might hear them afar of, and then they repeated only the&s;e Words very often; and every time they repeated them, they turned their Head from one &s;ide to the other, as if they looked upon one another by turns, to &s;hew their great Love one to another, &s;o they repeat the&s;e words very often, and every time quicker and quicker, until they abbreviate them at la&s;t, and &s;ay only, <HI>Lahu Huhu.</HI> By this pratling or jabbering and moving of their Heads, they became at length &s;o giddy and weary, that the cold Sweat ran down them. But this their Saint did not pronounce the words of their Prayers with the re&s;t, but &s;truck on his Brea&s;t with his Fi&s;t, upon his Heart, which gave in&s;tead thereof &s;o &s;trange a Tune, as if he had been hallow within, much like unto the Noi&s;e that a Turky-Cock u&s;es to make when he is very angry, &s;o that it would have frighted any Man, chiefly if he had been alone with him; and he would (with his terrible Face) rather have taken him to be an Appa|rition than a Man. The&s;e above-mentioned Words he repeateth &s;o often, and &s;o long, until he fainteth away, and falls down, and there he lieth as if he were dead. Then the others cover him, let him lie and go their ways. After he hath lain thus a good while as if he had been ravi&s;hed in his Prayers, or had &s;een a pecu|liar Vi&s;ion, he cometh to him&s;elf, ri&s;eth and appeareth again. All the&s;e Saints, although they practi&s;e their Religion after a peculiar manner, which according to their Opinion, is quite &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that which is pre|&s;cribed in their Law, to move the People the &s;ooner (regarding their &s;everity in living, their great Patience and frequent Ec&s;ta&s;ies) to believe them, that they un|der pretence of Piety, may go on in their hoggi&s;hne&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, and robberies (as they do) without any controuling: Yet becau&s;e their idle Hypocri&s;ie, and great Rogueries do daily appear more plainly, (not without great Damage to the Country) therefore they are no more in &s;o great e&s;teem, nor have &s;o much given them as formerly. Concerning their &s;trange way of Praying, (chiefly that of the <HI>Moors</HI>) their own

People have often told me, that becau&s;e &s;uch a De|votee changed his natural Voice given by him God, into an unnatural one, therefore he ought rather to be ac|counted a Bea&s;t than a Man, and con&s;equently much le&s;s ought to be e&s;teemed a Divine. Thus much I thought convenient to relate here of their Mendicants that travelled with us, and now I come to my former purpo&s;e again.</P>
<P>After we had &s;pent four Days in drying our Mer|chandices, and in mending our Ships, we did load them again, and &s;o &s;et out the next <HI>Friday,</HI> being the 3d. of <HI>September,</HI> about Noon. All that Day we &s;aw nothing but Bu&s;hes on both &s;ides of the River, wherein were &s;everal wild Bea&s;ts, but above all wild Boars, till Night, when we came in &s;ight of a little Village about two or three Miles di&s;tant, upon the a&s;cent, on our left Hand, where we landed and &s;tayed all Night. In that place I found nothing but a ba&s;tard Camel's Hay, which was like unto the true one, but without any Vir|tue in it.</P>
<P>The next Day our Navigation proceeded very well, and at Noon we came to a &s;trong Cittadel call'd <HI>Galant|za,</HI> which is &s;ituated at this &s;ide of the River, on a Hill belonging to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> with whom the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Emperor (as I was informed, and could under|&s;tand, that did not know their Language well) had long and heavy Wars; and could have done him (be|cau&s;e he could not follow him through the De&s;arts for want of Water and Provi&s;ions) no great hurt, if the King's Elde&s;t Son had not put him&s;elf into this Ca&s;tle, believing that he might be &s;ecure there from any A&s;|&s;ault from without, wherein he was mightily mi&s;taken. For after the <HI>Sultan</HI> did under&s;tand that he was there, he was re&s;olved to take it notwith&s;tanding all Difficul|ties. And therefore he &s;ummoned all his Forces toge|ther in the Year 1570. and did A&s;&s;ault it in three Places at the &s;ame time, &s;o long and &s;o often, until at length he took it by Storm, and &s;o he made the King's Son his Pri&s;oner, and carried him to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he had (as they &s;ay) his Head cut off the following Year. This Ca&s;tle (being &s;urrounded with &s;trong Walls,
<PB N="138" REF="85">
and having within a very high and large Tower) is &s;till, according to my Apprehen&s;ion, very &s;trong, but yet it lieth in ruins, and the three open places remain unrepaired. At Night we landed in a &s;mall I&s;land, which was not inhabited, and in the middle of the Ri|ver, we did not que&s;tion but we were there very well &s;ecured from the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and yet notwith&s;tan|ding, as &s;oon as we had &s;upp'd and began to go to re&s;t, &s;ome of them came creeping along to us, about Mid|night, rather to vi&s;it our Goods than us. But becau&s;e they dur&s;t not venture to go to our Ships, without great danger of being di&s;covered by our Watch, they did vi&s;it them that re&s;ted on &s;hoar, and had taken &s;ome|thing con&s;iderable from them, if they had not been di&s;covered immediately by them, and had retaken from them again, that which they could not &s;o readily carry over the River.</P>
<P>The Fifth Day of <HI>September,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Arabians</HI> appear|ed on &s;hoar early in the Morning; by and by we &s;aw more at a great Di&s;tance upon the height, and &s;ome Squadrons of Hor&s;e of Forty or Fifty &s;trong, ride a|bout, from whence we concluded that the King's Camp was not far off, which proved to be true. For about Noon, after we landed, the King's Younge&s;t Son came riding to us, on a high black Hor&s;e, with a Retinue of about Hundred Men, mo&s;t of which had Bows, and long Pikes made of Reed. He was but young, about Twenty Four or Twenty Five Years old, of a brow|ni&s;h Colour, and had a white Turbant on his Head made of Cotton, one end whereof hung down behind about a Span long, according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom. He had on a long Gown made of ordinary Sheeps Skins with the Wooll on them, which hung down to his Ankles, and &s;o had all his Courtiers, which were in their common Dre&s;s &s;o like unto one another, that one could not have di&s;cerned them, if his had not been edged with &s;ome Gold Li&s;ts (as we u&s;e to edge Chil|drens Coats in our Country) about the Neck and Sleeves, and had not had long Sleeves, whereon were &s;ome E&s;cutcheons to be &s;een. Becau&s;e Cu&s;tom is due to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> by rea&s;on of the <HI>Euphrates,</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="85">
therefore this Young Prince came to demand and take it; &s;o he went into the River, and rode fir&s;t to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ship, to &s;ee what Goods they carried, but find|ing nothing but Corn therein he did not &s;tay long there, but came to ours, his Servants that were on purpo&s;e ordered for that, helped him &s;oon up into it, and placed him in the middle of it on a Bale, but they them&s;elves went about from one Merchant to a|nother, to vi&s;it their Goods, and did open now and then a Che&s;t or a Bale, and took &s;ome out of them more or le&s;s, according as they liked them, &s;o that it was a great while before they came about from Mer|chant to Merchant. In the mean while, they brought al&s;o into the Ship a Young Prince, perhaps two Years old, which one carried before him on Hor&s;e-back after his Father. He had nothing on but only a Cotton Shirt, and Rings about his Neck, Wri&s;ts and Legs, made of fine <HI>Arabian</HI> Gold. At length his Servants came to me and my Comrades into the Poop of the Ship; but before we began to &s;hew them any of our Goods, they &s;aw my Gun that was in-laid with Ivory, which they took immediately, to &s;hew it to their Ma&s;ter, with a great deal of Admiration, being &s;uch a one as they had never &s;een in their Life before. The King took it pre&s;ently into his Hands, and was mighty well plea&s;ed with it, and &s;aid that it was Outlandi&s;h-Work made by the <HI>Franks</HI> (by which Name they call Out|landi&s;h-Men, <HI>French, German, Italian,</HI> &amp;c. becau&s;e they know no Divi&s;ions or Di&s;tinctions of our Country) &s;o we went both to him, and acquainted him that we were lately come from tho&s;e Countries, with an In|tention to go into the <HI>Indies.</HI> After the King under|&s;tood this, he &s;poke very kindly to us, and bid his Man to leave off and to &s;earch no more our Goods, and enquired after &s;everal other things, and at length he told my Comrade that he thought he had &s;een him before: Which was very true; for when my Com|rade lived at <HI>Halepo,</HI> where he had drove the <HI>Gold|&s;mith's</HI> Trade for a great while, he and others were &s;ent to the King (who was then at a little di&s;tance from <HI>Halepo</HI>) by the Con&s;ul of <HI>Venice,</HI> to pre&s;ent him in his
<PB N="140" REF="86">
Name, with &s;everal Pre&s;ents (whereof &s;ome were co&s;t|ly and rich wrought Cloths) when they came to him, and pre&s;ented them to him, he took them with a great deal of Kindne&s;s, and treated them very honourably, and &s;hewed them &s;everal &s;orts of Sport, as Jumping, Running, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they might &s;ee that he had a great many brave and handy Souldiers; and did di&s;patch them very generou&s;ly again, and promi&s;ed them (as my Friend told me) all Kindne&s;&s;es, chiefly to their Ma|&s;ters, &s;aying, That if they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of him again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> he would faithfully a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and that he did not doubt at all, if they &s;hould agree together, but they might go a great way with him in the&s;e Countries; nay, advance further up|on the <HI>Turk</HI> in a &s;hort time, even to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf. After the before-mentioned Di&s;cour&s;e, the King went to his Tents, that were pitched on a Plain by a Hill, within two Miles of us, and took &s;ome of our Com|pany along with him, to di&s;cour&s;e his Father a|bout our Concerns. I would willingly have pre&s;ented the King with my Gun (altho' we had to travel through many De&s;arts) and perhaps he would have been plea|&s;ed with it, but dur&s;t not do it before the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Souldiers, Mendicants and Jews, for I feared, that they would betray it, and accu&s;e me before the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and <HI>Cadi's,</HI> which &s;oon would have made me pu|ni&s;hable, altho' innocent, as they u&s;e to do to Stran|gers; nay, &s;ometimes tho&s;e of their own Nation; and be&s;ides, I did remember, that when the King was en|camped near <HI>Halepo,</HI> and &s;ome of his Men did daily come into the Town, to buy Provi&s;ion, Cloaths and other Things, that then it was &s;trictly forbidden to Sell them any Arms, Bows or Pikes, to take along with them into the De&s;arts. After we had &s;taid for our Friends a great while, they came &s;o late to us, that we were hindred from going any farther that Day, for it began to be late, and &s;o we &s;tay'd there all Night. They told us, that the King, after they had told him that we came from <HI>Halepo,</HI> would not believe them, but thought rather we came from <HI>Saphet</HI> (which Town is within a Day's Journey of <HI>Sidon,</HI> which the <HI>Sultan</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="86">
had taken from him a little while before) that he might have a Pretence to arre&s;t us and our Goods; and that he did &s;o ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in this Opinion, that they did really fear, he would have &s;ent &s;ome of his Men with one of us to <HI>Halepo,</HI> to know the certainty there|of, until they plainly demon&s;trated to him by their Letters from whence they came; whereupon he gave them Liberty to go on in their Journey. But I under|&s;tood afterwards, that it was only to pre&s;s &s;omething more out of them, as he really did, for they were forced to give him &s;ome Knives tip'd with Silver that came from <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and al&s;o &s;ome Damasks.</P>
<P>On the Sixth of <HI>September,</HI> we were up early, and pa&s;&s;ed between great Wilderne&s;&s;es, wherein were a|bundance of Wild Boars, that appeared &s;ometimes in great Herds: The&s;e Wilderne&s;&s;es continued &s;o long, that we &s;aw nothing el&s;e the whole Day but Woods, till in the Evening we came to <HI>Cala,</HI> a Village and Ca|&s;tle on this &s;ide of the River, which is no more but two Days Journey from <HI>Halepo,</HI> &s;ituated in a Plain; from whence you may conjecture how crooked the River is hitherto. This Ca&s;tle belongeth to a great <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> called <HI>John Rolandt,</HI> and al&s;o the fine Hou&s;e at <HI>Halepo,</HI> as is before mentioned. He hath very great Revenues and Sixty Sons: Six or Seven of them are <HI>Sangiacks,</HI> whereof &s;ome live at the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Court. Beyond this Ca&s;tle on the other &s;ide of the River, we lodged all Night in the Wilderne&s;s, which continued &s;o far, that we &s;aw nothing all the next Day long, but only here and there a little Cottage of the <HI>Moors,</HI> which generally are built upon Four Sticks, and co|vered with Bu&s;hes: Within them there are &s;o many Children, that I have often admired at the Number of them. They run in their fir&s;t Infancy to the River, and learn to &s;wim &s;o well, that they undertake without any fear to &s;wim over the broad River. When we went by, the <HI>Moors</HI> &s;aluted us very often, if the di|&s;tance did not hinder them, and that chiefly to learn of us where about their King was in the Country. For they have &s;o great a Re&s;pect for their King (al|tho' they are an Idle and Vagabond People) and una|nimou&s;ly
<PB N="142" REF="87">
&s;hew him &s;uch Obedience, as no other Na|tion doth to their Superiours; which al&s;o you may gue&s;s by this, that if any Outlandi&s;h Man hath a mind to get &s;afely through the Wilderne&s;s, or to &s;ee their King, let him but cloath him&s;elf in their Habit, and take a <HI>Moor</HI> along with him, to &s;hew him the way, and to be his Interpreter, they will readily tell him the way to go to him; or when they &s;ee that he hath one of their own Nation with him, they let him pa&s;s without any Mole&s;tation or Examination. So that tho&s;e that are Slaves on the Confines of <HI>Arabia,</HI> might ea&s;ily free them&s;elves without any trouble or danger. Their Wives did al&s;o often come to us, and brought us Milk in great flat Di&s;hes, which they &s;hewed us at a di&s;tance to &s;ell; wherefore we did land &s;ometimes, and received it, and gave them Biskets for it, for they have great want of Corn, &s;o that this inter|changing plea&s;ed us both. We u&s;ed to break Biskets into this Milk, and &s;o to eat it for Dinner or Sup|per, and &s;ometimes if it was too thick (or rather too little of it, that it might go the farther) we u&s;ed to temper or mix it with Water. They have al&s;o &s;ome|times put it into oblong Linen-Sacks, which it did hardly penetrate, and let it hang in the Ship for two or three Days, until it did curdle, and came to be in Curds, and &s;o it u&s;ed to &s;erve us with Biskets and Onions for Breakfa&s;t or for Supper. When we did land and had time to &s;pare, I u&s;ed to look about me for &s;ome &s;trange Plants, and among the re&s;t, I found a peculiar <HI>Schoenanthum,</HI> which was very like in Fi|gure unto the true one, but had not its Virtues, and the fir&s;t kind of <HI>Rhannus</HI> of <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius,</HI> with fat Leaves like unto Hou&s;leeke. I found al&s;o Goats Rue, and a &s;trange &s;ort of Willows, which &s;till are called by the Inhabitants by their old Name <HI>Garb.</HI> There al&s;o were abundance of Tamarisks; they were as big and high as our Cherry or Plum Trees, wherefore the&s;e Trees are di&s;cerned &s;oon at a di&s;tance by their height; they have very tender Leaves, and long purple co|loured tops, as you &s;ee in the &s;econd kind of our Ta|marisks, &s;o that between them and ours, there is no
<PB N="143" REF="87">
great Matter of Difference, but only in Bigne&s;s, and Fruit, whereof I found none at that time. The <HI>Moors</HI> feed their Cattle, for the mo&s;t part, with tho&s;e Bu&s;hes that grow at the River &s;ide, for in the Wilderne&s;s and De&s;arts (where the Ground is very &s;andy, lean and barren) there is but little Gra&s;s or tilled Ground, which occa&s;ioneth the great Scarcity of Bread among them, &s;o that often they &s;ee none in a great while, and are forced to eat their other food, as Fi&s;h, Fle&s;h, Chee&s;e and Milk (which they take from Goats, Sheep, Camels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) without Bread; &s;o that the&s;e poor People make a &s;hift with a mean Diet, and yet they are &s;trong and in good Health, and live to a good Age. At Night before it was dark, I &s;aw another Fortification, at the other &s;ide in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> on a high Hill called <HI>Jabar,</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> which is very large, and hath &s;everal Towers in the Wall, &s;o that as far as I could &s;ee, it was very like to that of <HI>Halepo.</HI> We &s;tay'd all Night on this &s;ide of it, in an I&s;land, where we had been robb'd again, If we had not kept a good Watch, &s;o as to perceive the Thieves, and to let off &s;everal Guns: Yet this we did not to hurt, but only to frighten them; for if we &s;hould have kill'd or wounded any of them, they would have fetch'd imme|diately, &s;ome (according as they are in &s;trength) it may be, Thou&s;and together, to revenge their Friend, to fall upon us, to beat us, and to plunder us (whereof they are very eager) and to take all we had. The &s;ame happened to us the next Day in another uninhabited I&s;land of the River, where we would dre&s;s no Vi|ctuals that Night, that they might not &s;py us by our Fire, to find us out and to fall upon us. For when we expected to keep our &s;elves thus quiet, and to re&s;t in good Tranquility, they did not mi&s;s us, but came to us in a greater Body than before, and that &s;o near, that we could not only hear them, but they began to talk with us. But when we &s;aw that they were in earne&s;t, we rouzed up our &s;elves, and got into Order, and &s;poke big to them, and bid them to offer no Violence to us, for if they did, they would find greater Re&s;i|&s;tance than they expected. But when we &s;aw that this
<PB N="144" REF="88">
our Exhortation would do no good, we were forced a|gain to have recour&s;e to our Guns, whereof we had but three, which we let go off, which frightened them in &s;uch a manner (for they are not u&s;ed to them) that they ran away, and left us in quietne&s;s. But it is no wonder that the <HI>Arabians</HI> are &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, for they are full of Want and Nakedne&s;s, have not to fill their Belly, nor to cover their Body withal; be&s;ides; they have no|thing el&s;e to do, and are u&s;ed to idlene&s;s from their very Infancy, and then becau&s;e they hate to Work, they are forced to wander like Vagabonds from one place to another. And (if they will maintain them|&s;elves and theirs) to &s;eek their livelihood from tho&s;e that travel through their Country. So &s;everal times there came two, three, or four together, &s;wimming through the River, were it never &s;o broad or deep, to our Ship, whereof &s;ome were black, and &s;ome brown, which came as naked into our Ship as ever they were born into the World, to beg a piece of Bread; to each of them we gave as much as would content them, &s;o they went &s;ometimes for a whole League along with us; and when they had eaten the Bread, and thanked us, they jumped into the River again and &s;wam away. Be&s;ides the&s;e we &s;aw daily as we went along many more, &s;wim over the River, which com|monly had &s;ome Bucks Skins blown up, whereon they tried to get over the ea&s;ier (for the River is &s;o broad, that it is not ea&s;y to make a Bridge over it, neither did I find any.) They take their Shirts (for be&s;ides them they wear no other Cloaths) tie them with their leathern Girdles about their Heads, and therein &s;tick their Daggers (which are pretty broad and bended like unto a Scythe) which hang down by their Tem|ples.</P>
<P>The Ninth Day our Voyage went on again chearily, and we came pretty near to the Town <HI>Racka,</HI> (which belongeth to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour) but it did not continue &s;o long, for before we had Dined and eaten a few Fruit, <HI>viz.</HI> Cibels, Anguries and <HI>Indian</HI> Musk-Melons, to refre&s;h our &s;elves in the great Heat, we incurred greater Danger again than that we were in be|fore,
<PB N="145" REF="88">
for our Ship (which was a great deal bigger than either of the other two) did &s;trike upon the Sand &s;o &s;e|verely, that we could not bring her off again with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, (as we had done &s;everal times before) nor bring her into the right way again. So we were forced to de&s;ire the <HI>Arabians</HI> our Antago|ni&s;ts, which &s;tood and looked upon us, rather rejoicing in our Misfortunes, than pitying us, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, which at length we did obtain, and &s;o they came to help us: But becau&s;e they had their Daggers, and great Cud|gels, which they u&s;e to wear with them, we dur&s;t not tru&s;t them, but were forced to leave a &s;mall Guard in the Ship, but the re&s;t of us helped them with all our Force and Strength, but we could not &s;tir her, &s;o that they went away twice and left us. At la&s;t we concluded, that we had no better way, than to unload our Ships, yet we dur&s;t not do it for fear of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> nor venture our Merchandices; &s;o we re&s;olved to draw her out another way, wherefore we de&s;ired the <HI>Arabians</HI> a third time, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and if they were in earne&s;t to help us, we begged of them to lay down their Arms, which at length, upon our promi&s;ing them a good Reward, they did. When they came we took al&s;o our Guard to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;et all hands at work, and with hard Labour we brought it at length into the right Stream again, &s;o we paid the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and went on, and came that &s;ame Night to <HI>Racka.</HI></P>

<P><HI>RAcka,</HI> a Town of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> is &s;ituated in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia</HI> upon the great River <HI>Euphra|tes,</HI> between two a&s;cents, &s;o that you cannot &s;ee any thing of it before you come near it.

Among the re&s;t there is yet &s;tanding a very ancient high Building, which is &s;till very &s;trong, and looketh very great (although it is much decayed and run to ruin) and &s;uch as one &s;hall rarely &s;ee, &s;o that one may conjecture, that it hath perhaps been former|ly the Seat and Habitation of their Kings or Magi|&s;trates. Between the New and Old City lieth a Ca|&s;tle, which is al&s;o Old and pretty &s;trong, where is kept a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on, it being on the Confines or Limits of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. to defend them and all the Country from Danger and Incur&s;ions. The Old Town is be&s;ides this quite demoli&s;hed, and even with the Ground, &s;o that here is no convenient place where the <HI>Turks</HI> can exerci&s;e them&s;elves in Running, Cudgel-playing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but this, where I have often &s;ate upon the ruined Walls and looked upon them when they were a Playing. To the De&s;olation of this Town, have very much contributed the <HI>Tartars,</HI> under their

King <HI>Haalono,</HI> who took it in the Year of our Lord, 1260, and not long after the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Halepo,</HI> with the help of <HI>Ayton</HI> King of <HI>Armenia.</HI> Some will have this to be the Town of <HI>Rhages,</HI> which is al&s;o called <HI>Ede&s;&s;a,</HI> whither the Ancient and Pious <HI>Tobias,</HI> did &s;end his Son from <HI>Nineve,</HI> to his Friend <HI>Gabel,</HI> to fetch the Money from him which he had lent him: But becau&s;e this lies a Day's Journey further from the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> therefore it cannot be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>After we had landed there, the Receiver of the Cu&s;tom came on Hor&s;e-back to the &s;hoar, and de&s;ired the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ship, to deliver his Arms, Lances and Bows, who ab&s;olutely denied it, &s;eeing that it never had been a Cu&s;tom before; whereupon they fell about this into &s;uch a hot Di&s;pute, that they began to draw upon one another, and had not we time|ly put in between them, it would have cau&s;ed a great Tumult. The rea&s;on why this Man behaved him&s;elf &s;o &s;trangely, was becau&s;e we did not go with our Goods to <HI>Carahemit</HI> (which Town is di&s;tant four Days Journey, and &s;ituated on the rapid River <HI>Tigris</HI>) to have laid there upon that River, where he would have received a great deal more Cu&s;tom, that al&s;o be|longing to him. But the <HI>Turk</HI> not mattering him, having nothing in but Corn, which he would not carry, he let him alone, and came to us as Strangers, think|ing to make up his Lo&s;s from us, and to frighten us out of it. He &s;taid all Night in the Ship, and lay be|tween us (fearing that we &s;hould hide &s;ome Goods from him;) and &s;ometimes he came upon us with big Words, &s;aying, <HI>Seeing that it was not allowed to us Out-landi&s;h Men to travel in the&s;e Parts, therefore he could not but take us to be Spies, that came to di&s;cover, rather than for any thing el&s;e, wherefore he had rea|&s;on enough to take our Goods in Arre&s;t, and to &s;end us two as Spies to</HI> Con&s;tantinople, <HI>to make us Slaves to his Ma&s;ter, the Great</HI> Sultan. After we had heard this his unrea&s;onable Di&s;cour&s;e, and were al&s;o &s;en&s;ible of his Intention to cheat us, we were not pre&s;ently frightned, but drew out our Pa&s;s we had from the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and <HI>Cadi</HI> of <HI>Halepo,</HI> and &s;hewed it to him.
<PB N="148" REF="90">
He looked it over, and after he under&s;tood that he dur&s;t not very well act again&s;t it, he went away from us with a deal of Indignation, and immediately he be|gan to quarrel with all the Merchants of the two Ships, and de&s;ired of them an unrea&s;onable Sum to pay him as Toll, whereof they complained heavily; but he went on and would accept of no rea&s;onable Condi|tions, but took away our Rowers from our Ships, to hinder us from going away, to &s;queeze us the more. But the Merchants although they &s;aw his earne&s;tne&s;s, they did not matter it, but &s;ent on the 11th. of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> one of them with a <HI>Moor</HI> to <HI>Carahemit,</HI> to the Great <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> which was the Son of <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> to complain to him of the&s;e Impo&s;itions and Extor|tions. When the Toll-keeper did under&s;tand this, he followed them with his Son immediately. But becau&s;e he did not find the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> (which was then in ano|ther place called <HI>Gi&s;elet,</HI> whither our Friend was forced to follow him three Days Journey from thence) he re|turned again immediately. Although he did not &s;peak with the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> yet he fal&s;ly told us, that it was the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI>'s Order that we &s;hould pay him Ten Ducats <HI>per cent.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding that, ours did not know any thing, yet they would not tru&s;t him, but had carried the be&s;t and greate&s;t Part of their Goods out, before he came into the Ships to &s;earch, and al&s;o &s;ome thereof they buried in the Sand by Night, where the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> went over by Day Light, and yet they could find none of the&s;e hidden Goods. The next morning early the Publi|can came with his Crue, and &s;earched every thing with a great deal of Care, as if he had a peculiar Com|mand for it, but did not find any thing near (as you may think) what he expected. When he was thus very bu&s;y in exerci&s;ing his Office, our Friend came in at la&s;t, and told us, that the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> was very much di&s;plea&s;ed, that the Publican did deal &s;o unju&s;tly with us, contrary to the Orders and Law of his Ma&s;ter the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> and did keep us &s;o long, and hinder us in our Navigation. Wherefore he had writ to the <HI>Sangiack</HI> in our behalf, and ordered him on pain of
<PB N="149" REF="90">
Death, to take all Care that we might not be detained any longer, but to take the Publican Pri&s;oner, and to &s;end him to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to have him tried at the Court kept for that purpo&s;e every 15th. Day, and that he feared very much, that he would pay for this his Mi&s;demeanour with his Life.</P>
<P>In the mean time we were thus detained Pri|&s;oners on the Rivers of <HI>Babylon,</HI> expecting with a deal of Patience the time of our Deliverance, it happened, that the King of <HI>Arabia</HI> broke up with his Retinue from here-about on the 21&s;t. Day of <HI>September,</HI> and travelled towards the South in great Numbers, to find better Pa&s;tures for his Bea&s;ts, as Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and Camels, that they might the better &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for in the&s;e Places there are not &s;o many Villages, Towns and Market-Towns, where they might have their conti|nual abode. Neither do they love Farming nor Tra|ding, but are contented, if they have a great Stock of Cattle, and good &s;tore of Gra&s;s for them, that they may keep them. So if they come to a Rivolet, where a little Herbage or Gra&s;s groweth, they immediately erect their Tents there, to &s;tay there till want forceth them to remove, and to look out for another Place. When they break up, they take along with them Man, Maid, Bea&s;ts and all their whole Sub&s;tance, as I did &s;ee them remove at this very time, and come towards this Town in great Numbers, &s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> kept their Gates &s;hut up for four Days, until they were all pa&s;s'd by. On Hor&s;e-back they are armed with Darts and Bows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and al&s;o if they ride on Camels, where|of they have a very great Number, chiefly when the King is moving from one place to another, as &s;ome of them did relate to me, where generally are imployed 150000. I my own &s;elf have once &s;een at one time to|gether about the number of 3 or 4000 Camels. They are &s;trong and hardy Creatures, fit to carry heavy Burthens, and al&s;o to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Drinking in the greate&s;t Heats for Three Days together. They &s;tale out between their hind Legs, &s;o that tho&s;e that go in Caravans behind them mu&s;t have a great Care, that they be not hit by them, and &s;o become all bedaubed.
<PB N="150" REF="91">
Their Hor&s;es are very Noble, Neat, and fit for bu&s;ine&s;s; they &s;eldom feed them more than once a Day, altho' they ride them very hard all Day long through the Wilderne&s;&s;es. They commonly cut off all the Hair from their Mains and Tail, &s;o that their Tails remain very naked, and look &s;omething like the Tail of a Lion. They put their Wives on little A&s;&s;es, and al&s;o upon high Camels with their Children, three or four of them to|gether in Boxes, as it is the fa&s;hion in the&s;e Countries. They are of a brown Colour like unto our <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> and almo&s;t the fourth Part of them black, which dif|ference of Colour proceedeth from that in travelling up and down, to places where Blacks are. They &s;ome|times leave their own there, and take Blacks in the room of them. The King of <HI>Arabia</HI> is always en|camped in the Fields, and never cometh into a place that is &s;hut up or enclo&s;ed; and this the le&s;s now, after the Mi&s;chance of lo&s;ing his Son that retired into one, happened; &s;o he goeth from place to place like unto the <HI>Tartars,</HI> &s;o that often it is not known where he is. In the Summer time he goeth further to the North, and in the Winter to the South, to avoid both the Heat and Cold, and to have better Sub&s;i&s;tance and Provi&s;ion for him&s;elf, his Men and Cattle. So it hath happened &s;everal times, that the <HI>Arabians</HI> in their march have come too near to the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions, and the <HI>Turks</HI> again to his, from whence aro&s;e be|tween the&s;e two great Princes &s;uch Differences, that they are come to great and bloody Wars. And yet for all this (as I am credibly informed) they have now both made a peculiar League and Contract be|tween them, wherein it is agreed that if the <HI>Grand Turk</HI> &s;hould go to a War with his Neighbours, then the <HI>Arabian</HI> King will A&s;&s;i&s;t and Defend him, where|fore the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> writes to him as his Cou&s;in and good Friend, and is to pay him the &s;um of 60000 Ducats yearly as his certain Salary or retaining Fee. And be&s;ides all this, the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;ends to the New King of <HI>Arabia</HI> after the Decea&s;e of the Old one, a Standard with his Coat of Arms in it, which toge|ther with other Pre&s;ents he &s;ends him, with u&s;ual
<PB N="151" REF="91">
Ceremonies, to congratulate him on his happy coming to the Throne, and to renew and confirm their Allian|ces. Their Religion doth contribute not a &s;mall matter to this, which (together with all their Ceremonies, and all other Points) is the &s;ame almo&s;t they profe&s;s in both Nations: And they take as many Wives as the <HI>Turks</HI> do, neither do they extol or magnifie one before the other, becau&s;e they come from better Parents, being they buy them all from them. And therefore none of them is excu&s;ed, becau&s;e &s;he cometh from a greater Ex|traction, from doing the Family-bu&s;ine&s;s, nor hath a poor one more put upon her, becau&s;e &s;he came from mean Extraction. So one of the King of <HI>Arabia</HI>'s Wives is a Daughter of a Man that keepeth a Sawing-Mill at <HI>Racka,</HI> which by him (although of a mean Extraction) is as much re&s;pected as any of the re&s;t. Her Father and Brothers are very good People; they came very often to us, and &s;hewed great Compa&s;&s;ion, for that we were &s;o abu&s;ed by the Publican. His Milk is not drawn by Hor&s;es as ours are, nor by Water, (for they know nothing of that) but two of them cut the Wood with great hand-labour. During our &s;taying there, a Young <HI>Arabian</HI> Gentleman, nearly related to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> came very often to us to the Water-&s;ide, who was always accompanied with Twenty Servants with Bows and Darts; he had a delicate white Tur|bant on, and a long Violet, coloured Caban made of Wooll, but his Servants went pretty bare, for &s;ome of them wore black Caps and long <HI>Indigo</HI> coloured Shirts with wide Sleeves, which they girt up with broad Lea|thern Girdles, wherein &s;tuck bended Daggers or Bago|nets, as it is their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom. It once happened, that &s;ome of us being upon the High-Town Walls to|gether, from whence we had a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect down into the Valley to the great River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> this &s;ame Gentleman came to us again, and &s;eated him&s;elf with his Retinue over again&s;t us, and pre&s;ented us with &s;ome dried Cicer Pea&s;e (whereof I have made mention before) and &s;ome Cibebs mixt together, which we thankfully received; and to &s;hew our thankfulne&s;s, we pre&s;ented him again with &s;ome Almonds, Figs, Nuts,
<PB N="152" REF="92">
and &s;ome very good Sweet-meats we had brought with us from <HI>Halepo,</HI> which he al&s;o received very kindly. So we all began to eat each of us part of his Pre&s;ent, and drunk with it &s;ome Water of the <HI>Euphrates.</HI> After we had eat them all, and we thought the time to be long, he beckon'd to one of his Mu&s;icians, and bid him to divert us with his In&s;trument, which he pulled out pre&s;ently (which about the Neck looked very like unto a Cittern) and we expected to hear &s;ome rarity, but when I looked upon it, and &s;aw it had but one String that was as big as a Cord of their Bows, he began to play &s;ome of their Tunes, but with what Art and Dex|terity you may ea&s;ily fan&s;ie. He did this for almo&s;t two Hours, and according to his Opinion very harmoni|ou&s;ly, but we thought the time &s;o long, that we were very glad when he had done.</P>
<P>About the River I found that &s;ort of <HI>Acacia</HI> that beareth roundi&s;h and brown-coloured Pods, called <HI>Schock</HI> and <HI>Schamuth</HI> by the <HI>Arabians:</HI> Some Thorns called <HI>Algul,</HI> whereon the <HI>Manna</HI> falleth, chiefly in the County of <HI>Cora&s;cen,</HI> as <HI>Avicen</HI> tells us. <HI>Chame&s;y|ces,</HI> &s;ome &s;trange kinds of Mo&s;&s;es, which are very much differing in bigne&s;s: Among the re&s;t I &s;aw the low prickly Herb, by &s;ome e&s;teemed to be the <HI>Tragun</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;corides.</HI> Below, clo&s;e to the River, I found the <HI>Herba Sacra</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> which the Learned <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius</HI> hath accurately de&s;cribed in his Second <HI>Book</HI> and the 45th. <HI>Chapter</HI> of his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of Out-landi&s;h Plants; and ju&s;t by the&s;e, more &s;trange ones, chiefly a delicate one growing plentifully there in the Sand, which had from Five to Eight tender Stalks, which &s;pread them&s;elves into others, that were very full of Joints, &s;o that it crept rather on the Ground than grew up; by each of them &s;tood three or four roundi&s;h Marjoram or <HI>Origa|num</HI> Leaves together, and above between them &s;ome Star like white Flowers, with &s;ix pointed Leaves like unto our <HI>Ornithogalum,</HI> each of them on a peculiar Foot|&s;talk, the Seeds thereof I have not &s;een, but the Roots are &s;mall and fibrous, which together with their &s;mall bitterne&s;s, have a pretty ex&s;iccating quality; and &s;o in this re&s;pect are very like unto the <HI>Polycnemon</HI> of

<P>UPon this good and &s;evere Command of the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> Son of <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;haw,</HI> we were acquitted of our long Arre&s;t, and went away about Noon on the 27th. of <HI>September</HI>; we went again from thence through &s;uch great De&s;arts, that for &s;ome Days we &s;aw nothing worth relating, but here and there little Huts made of &s;ome erected Boughs, and covered with &s;ome Bu&s;hes, wherein the <HI>Moors</HI> with their Families live, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the great Heat, Rain and Dews that are in the&s;e Parts mo&s;t violent, &s;o that I admired how the&s;e mi&s;erable People could maintain them&s;elves and &s;o many Children in the&s;e dry and &s;andy Places where nothing was to be had. Where|fore the&s;e poor People are very naked, and &s;o hungry that many of them if they &s;aw us afar off, would fling them&s;elves into the great River, and &s;wim to us to fetch a piece of Bread. And when we flung at
<PB N="154" REF="93">
them whole handfulls, they would &s;nap at it ju&s;t like hungry Fi&s;h or Ducks, and eat it: Others did gather it and put it into the Crown which they make neatly of their Sheets on the top of their Heads, and &s;o &s;wim away with it. After the&s;e &s;andy De&s;arts had continued a great while, we came at length out of them between high, rough and bare Hills, which were &s;o barren, that there was to be &s;een neither Plough-Lands nor Meadows, neither Hou&s;e nor Stick, neither High-way nor Foot-path, wherefore tho&s;e People that live there, have no Hou&s;es, but Caves and Tents, as they have in the great De&s;arts, where becau&s;e of the great Heat and Drine&s;s, the Soil is &s;o barren, that they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a place for any con&s;iderable time, nor have Villages or certain Habitations: Wherefore they wander up and down, fall upon the Caravans and plunder them, and make what &s;hift they can to get a livelihood. The&s;e Mountains, as I am informed, reach to the River <HI>Jor|dan,</HI> the <HI>Dead</HI> and the <HI>Red-Seas,</HI> &amp;c. wherein are &s;ituated Mount <HI>Sinai, Horeb,</HI> &amp;c. and the Town <HI>Petra,</HI> which by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> is called <HI>Petra</HI> of the <HI>De|&s;arts.</HI> The <HI>Arabians</HI> that live in the&s;e De&s;arts, and round about them, are extraordinary Marks-men for Bows and Arrows, and to fling Darts which are made of Canes: They are a very numerous People, and go out in great Parties every where almo&s;t: they are a very ancient Nation, and come from the Sons of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> but chiefly from his Elde&s;t Son <HI>Nebajoth,</HI> and were an|ciently called the War-like <HI>Nabathees,</HI> and their Coun|try, the Land or Province of the <HI>Nabathees,</HI> which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> te&s;tifieth in <HI>Book</HI> I. <HI>Chap.</HI> 21. where he &s;ays, that the Twelve Sons of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> which he had by an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Wife, (his Mother <HI>Agar,</HI> from whom they were called <HI>Agarens,</HI> as you may &s;ee in the fir&s;t of the <HI>Chronicles</HI> and the &s;ixth Ver&s;e, being al&s;o of the &s;ame Country&punc;) were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the Country between the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and the <HI>Red-Seas,</HI> and called it the Province of the <HI>Nabathees.</HI> The <HI>Midianites</HI> that bought <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of his Brethren, and carried him into <HI>E|gypt,</HI> may al&s;o be reckoned among the&s;e. This &s;ame Country is al&s;o chiefly by <HI>Pliny</HI> (becau&s;e thereabout
<PB N="155" REF="93">
are no other Habitations, but Tents, wherein the In|habitants live) called <HI>Scenitis.</HI> From this we may con|clude that the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> in his 60th. Chapter, and <HI>David</HI> in his 120th. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> did &s;peak of them, when chiefly the latter maketh mention of the Tents of <HI>Kedar,</HI> whereby he under&s;tands a Country that is inha|bited by &s;uch a Nation as liveth in Tents, and is de|rived from <HI>Kedar</HI> the Son of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> whom his Fa|ther <HI>Abraham</HI> as a &s;trange Child, born by his Maid <HI>Agar,</HI> did thru&s;t out together with his Mother into the De&s;arts; his words are the&s;e, <HI>Wo is me, that I &s;ojourn in</HI> Me&s;heck, <HI>that I dwell in the Tents of</HI> Kedar. In our times the&s;e and other Nations are called the <HI>Sa|racens,</HI> which have very much encrea&s;ed under <HI>Maho|met</HI> (which by his Mother was an <HI>I&s;hmaelite</HI>) and did &s;pread very much; and &s;o they were in <HI>David</HI>'s time a very &s;trong Nation, wherefore he prayeth very earne&s;t|ly (in his 83 <HI>P&s;alm</HI>) that God would puni&s;h and &s;lay and di&s;per&s;e them, as Enemies of his Holy Church. But that I may come to our former Intention again, here the <HI>Arabians</HI> asked us very often again, where their King was at that time, &s;o that our Ma&s;ter had bu|&s;ine&s;s enough to an&s;wer them; whereby you may ob|&s;erve what great Re&s;pect and Love they have for their King. But that they might not altogether look upon us as Outlandi&s;h Men, nor pre&s;ently di&s;cern us to be Strangers, we did &s;ometimes when there was occa&s;ion for it, change our Turbants, and let one end thereof according to their Fa&s;hion hang down, which they do to make them&s;elves a Shade again&s;t the Heat, that is very cruel in the&s;e Countries. But yet if any body, be he who he will, doth enquire after their King, and wants to come before him, to pre&s;ent him with a Suit of Cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or to de&s;ire a Pa&s;s from him, or if one &s;hould go about to hire one of them, to &s;hew him the way to a certain place, or through their Country, (which he may do for a very &s;mall price,) he would &s;oon find one or other that would be ready to do it; but among the <HI>Turks</HI> there is no &s;uch Obedi|ence; for if you &s;hould de&s;ire any thing of them to do, in the Name of their <HI>Sultan,</HI> they are not willing
<PB N="156" REF="94">
to do it, except it would redound to their great Pro|fit. Wherefore a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Guide to conduct you would co&s;t you a great deal more than one of them. Be|&s;ides, they al&s;o remember their Ma&s;ter daily, and hard|ly &s;peak of any thing but of him, his great riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but with &s;uch Pride and Greatne&s;s, chiefly when they &s;peak of his powerfulne&s;s, and enlarging of his King|dom, as if &s;ome &s;hare of the&s;e were belonging to them, and that they mu&s;t be re&s;pected for it. In this Navi|gation through the great De&s;arts, we two did not &s;pend much, becau&s;e the Towns were at &s;o great a di&s;tance from one another that we could not reach them, to provide our &s;elves daily with Nece&s;&s;aries (as we do in our Country on the <HI>Danube</HI> and <HI>Rhine</HI>) or Lodgings. We were nece&s;&s;itated to be contented with &s;ome &s;light Food or other, and make a &s;hift with Curds, Chee&s;e, Fruits, Honey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to take any of the&s;e with &s;ome Bread for a good Entertainment. The Honey in the&s;e Parts is very good, and of a whiti&s;h colour, whereof they take in their Caravans and Navigations, great Leathern Bottles-full along with them; this they bring you in &s;mall Cups, and put a little Butter to it, and &s;o you eat it with Biskets. By this Di&s;h I often remembred St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> the fore-runner of our Lord, how he al&s;o did eat Honey in the De|&s;arts, together with other Food. Be&s;ides this when we had a mind to Fea&s;t our &s;elves, &s;ome ran, as &s;oon as our Ma&s;ter had landed at Night, to fetch &s;ome Wood, and others in the mean time made a hole in the Ground on the Shoar, in the nature of a Furnace, to boil our Meat. So every Company dre&s;&s;ed accor|dingly what they had a mind to, or what they had laid up in Store; &s;ome boil'd Rice, others ground Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And when they had a mind to eat New Bread in&s;tead, or for want of Biskets, they made a pa&s;te of Flower and Water, and wrought it into broad Cakes about the thickne&s;s of a Finger, and put them in a hot place on the ground, heated on purpo&s;e by Fire, and covered it with A&s;hes and Coals, and turn|ed it &s;everal times until it was enough.

<HI>Arabians</HI> have in their Tents, Stones or Copper-Plates made on purpo&s;e to bake them. On the 4th. Day, being the la&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> about Noon, we came to the end of the Mountains, before which without, on this &s;ide, lieth a very &s;trong Citadel, on a high Hill, built three &s;quare, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Seleby,</HI> whereof two Points go downwards towards the River, and the third upward a great way on the Mountain, &s;o that in its &s;ituation it is very like unto <HI>Baden</HI> in <HI>Switzer|land.</HI> Although it is demoli&s;hed, yet it is &s;till very &s;trong in its Walls, that are to be &s;een at the top and on the &s;ides, chiefly towards the Hills, and the River &s;ide, to hinder the Pa&s;&s;age both by Water and Land. There are al&s;o &s;till &s;tanding &s;ome Watch-hou&s;es with|out, as you come towards it near the Mountains, which may hold three or four Souldiers: yet it lieth &s;till to this Day in ruins, and &s;o de&s;olated, that nothing but Birds and Bea&s;ts inhabit it; whereof a great many ap|peared on the Rivers &s;ide, as <HI>Herns, Ducks,</HI> that were very large and of a delicate Colour, and others, a|mong which were &s;ome of a white Colour, called <HI>Pe|licans</HI> by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and <HI>Onocrotali</HI> by others, which are as big as <HI>Swans</HI>; the Prophet <HI>Zephaniah</HI> maketh al&s;o mention of them in his &s;econd Chapter, when he progno&s;ticated the puni&s;hment that was to come to the <HI>Ninevites, A&s;&s;yrians</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI>; there al&s;o ap|peared &s;ome quite black, with long Necks; whereof I did &s;ee abundance in my Travels into the <HI>Land of Pro|mi&s;e,</HI> and e&s;pecially near <HI>Acon,</HI> among the Rocks and Crags of the Sea; as far as I could di&s;cern them at a di&s;tance, they &s;eemed to be a kind of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">I gue&s;s them rather to have been <HI>Cormorants</HI>; no <HI>Ea|gles</HI> having long Necks.</NOTE> <HI>Sea-Eagle,</HI> that feed more upon Fi&s;h than any thing el&s;e.

&amp;c. I &s;hould have been very glad to have been a little better informed, but the Language wherewith I was not well acquainted, did hinder me. And &s;up|po&s;e I &s;hould have under&s;tood it very well, or enough to have made an enquiry after tho&s;e Particulars, yet I could not have done it without great Danger, to have been taken for a Spy; for they &s;oon &s;u&s;pect Outlandi&s;h Men on every little occa&s;ion, which tho&s;e that Trade in the&s;e Parts have often experienced not without great Lo&s;s and Danger. Beyond the Mountains in the low Country we &s;aw more tilled Grounds, and Habitations of the <HI>Arabians</HI> than we had done before, wherefore our Ma&s;ter landed &s;ooner than he u&s;ed to do, near a Village, to take in Provi&s;ion for our further Journey, where the People brought Fle&s;h and <HI>Indian Melons</HI> to us to &s;ell. Here it happened, that about Midnight, one of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Souldiers went out to ea&s;e him&s;elf to the River &s;ide; and when he was bu&s;y about it, a <HI>Moor</HI> came creeping along to him, and thru&s;t him into the River before he was aware of it, and run a|way. The <HI>Turk</HI> finding him&s;elf in the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> fell a crying out for help; I hearing him, &s;tanding Sentinel that Night, did not fail him, but made what ha&s;te I could, with my Scymeter in my Hand, followed his Voice, and came to the place, although it was very dark, drew him out, and brought him into the Ship, which was &s;o kindly taken by the re&s;t of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that I got mightily into their Favour, and received many Kindne&s;&s;es of them all the way until we came to <HI>Bagdet,</HI> the Garri&s;on which they went to rein|force.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> when our Voyage went on a|gain, there came early in the Morning a Po&s;t of &s;ix <HI>Arabians</HI> on Hor&s;e back to the River &s;ide, to enquire of us whither their King was gone, or where we thought they might find him, they had received Let|ters for him from the <HI>Sultan,</HI> wherefore they mu&s;t follow him until they found him. The Ma&s;ter of our Ship told 'em (and &s;o he did to every body that asked him) that we had &s;een him in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> which Province he called <HI>Amanachar,</HI> that he was broken up with his Men to
<PB N="159" REF="95">
go back into <HI>Arabia,</HI> where they would find him. After this relation they departed, and we went on our way, and &s;oon &s;aw below a Town to our right at a di&s;tance, called <HI>Seccard,</HI> very well &s;ituated on an a&s;cent, belong|ing to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> wherefore &s;ome of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;aid, that none but <HI>Haramiquiber,</HI> that is great Thieves lived in it, which they do out of &s;pite to all them, that are &s;ubject to any other Ma&s;ter, than their <HI>Sultan.</HI> This Town we pa&s;&s;ed by, and went directly towards <HI>Deer</HI> another Town, whence we were then three Leagues di&s;tant, yet they do not accompt their di&s;tances by Leagues, for they know little or nothing of it, but rather reckon by Days Journeys, for their Towns are &s;o &s;ituated, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they have &s;ometimes to go through divers Wilderne&s;&s;es, &s;everal Days, more or le&s;s, before they arrive there. Before we came thither, one of the Ships in our Com|pany did go too much toward one &s;ide, toward a Branch of the River, that runs by the Town, (for it divideth it &s;elf into &s;everal Branches) where it got in|to the Mud and &s;tuck. Our Ma&s;ter &s;eeing this, land|ed immediately, and did &s;end his Men to help them. So I got time to look after the &s;trange Plants, and found there about the River many great <HI>Tamarisk</HI>-Trees, and al&s;o a peculiar &s;ort of <HI>Willow,</HI> which the In|bitants &s;till call by its ancient <HI>Arabian</HI> Name <HI>Garb.</HI> The&s;e Trees do not grow high, but &s;pread very much; the Twigs thereof are &s;tronger and not &s;o tough, as to make Bands or Withs as ours will; the Bark is of a pale yellow Colour, and &s;o are the Leaves, which are long and about two Fingers broad, and at the edges round about crenated, &s;o that they are very much dif|fering from the re&s;t of this kind. I found them to be of a pretty drying and a&s;tringent quality. Of their Flowers and Fruit (whereof <HI>Avicen</HI> maketh mention in his 126 and 686 <HI>Chap.</HI>) I can &s;ay nothing, becau&s;e I &s;aw none. Hereabout the <HI>Turk</HI> (that would not &s;tay until we were cleared, but went away before us) did &s;uffer Shipwrack, and &s;o lo&s;t a great deal of his Corn, that he intended to carry to <HI>Bagdet</HI> (called <HI>Baldac</HI>) to &s;ell it in the great Scarcity, which was oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="160" REF="96">
for want of Rain, for there fell none in the &s;pace of two Years and a half. And yet, as they &s;ay, if it raineth but twice or thrice a Year, they have enough to &s;upply them&s;elves. After our Men had wrought longer than an hour together with theirs, until they had emptied the Ships, they came to us again to go that Night to <HI>Deer.</HI> But there being &s;everal Rocks before it, which were very dangerous to pa&s;s, &s;ome of their Pilots, that under&s;tood the depths, came out to meet and did help us, &s;o that we got &s;afe there. The Town of <HI>Deer,</HI> which is not very big, and belongs to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> is &s;ituated on this &s;ide of the River, on an a&s;cent, and is pretty well built with Hou&s;es (where|on &s;tood great Numbers of People when we went in|to it, to &s;ee us) but as for the Walls and Ditches, they are but very &s;light. At our fir&s;t arrival, we thought we &s;hould &s;oon get clear for the Cu&s;tom with the <HI>Armin,</HI> and &s;o Ship off again, but he was not in Town, &s;o that we were forced to &s;tay three Days for his coming. In the mean time we got acquaintance with the Inhabitants, which were hand&s;ome, lu&s;ty and well-&s;et, and white, and more mannerly than the re&s;t; they vi&s;ited us frequently, and &s;poke kindly to us, &s;o that we found a va&s;t Difference between tho&s;e and the former. The <HI>Armin</HI> al&s;o (who was no le&s;s civil) we pre&s;ented at his return, with a great di&s;h fill'd up with <HI>Cibebs,</HI> and &s;everal &s;orts of Confectures, and laid round about with Soap balls (as is the Fa&s;hion in the&s;e Countries) but to them that were with him and of his Family, we gave &s;ome Sheets of white Paper, which they willingly received, and were &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that &s;ome of them (as the Children do in our Country when we give them &s;omething that is &s;trange or plea&s;ing to them) &s;miled at it as often as they looked on it. The Country there about is pretty fer|tile and plentiful of Corn, <HI>Indian</HI> Millet, Cotton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they have al&s;o between the Rivers very good Gar|dens for the Kitchin, with all &s;orts of Plants and Fruits in them, viz. <HI>Colliflowers, Citruls, Pumpions, Cucum|bers, Anguriens,</HI> or Water-Melons, which they call <HI>Bathiecae,</HI> whereof they have &s;o many, that you may

buy forty great ones for one <HI>A&s;per</HI> (whereof three make a <HI>Medin</HI>) much about the value of our Penny. There were al&s;o &s;ome Date Trees, Limon and Citron, and other Trees, which I could not di&s;tingui&s;h at a di&s;tance.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of our Voyage to the Famous Town</HI> Ana, <HI>in which we pa&s;&s;ed again through great &s;andy Wilderne&s;&s;es; for the performance whereof we mu&s;t provide our &s;elves with Victuals, and be very careful in our Navigation: Some relation of the Inhabitants, of their Cloaths, and other things we did ob&s;erve and &s;ee by the way, and what el&s;e did happen un|to us.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter we had paid the Cu&s;tom to the <HI>Armin</HI> (who was a great deal more civil than he at <HI>Racka</HI>) and provided our &s;elves with all Nece&s;&s;aries, we did but half load our Ships, to draw them out of the branch again, into the River, and then we carried the re&s;t to them by Boats and &s;mall Ships, for the Water was very low and full of Mud, &s;o that we went from thence on the 4th. Day of <HI>October</HI> in the Evening, and &s;o &s;taid all Night, a little below <HI>Deer.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning our Navigation proceeded very well till Noon, when we came to a very broad and &s;hallow place of the River, that our Ma&s;ter did not know which way to get through. When he was thus troubled and con&s;idering, there appeared on the Height, on the Shoar, &s;ome <HI>Arabians,</HI> and &s;hewed us the Cour&s;e we mu&s;t take, but we dur&s;t not tru&s;t them, for we had
<PB N="162" REF="97">
heard before, that they had &s;unk &s;ome great Stones there, and that a Month before they had per&s;waded a Ship to go that way, which did not di&s;cover their Cheat, until their Ship after &s;everal hard knocks did &s;plit in pieces and &s;ink. The &s;ame they would have &s;erved others, which, although they did not fol|low their Coun&s;el, yet they came into &s;uch Danger, that they could not deliver them&s;elves out of it in a whole Days-time. We (Thanks be to God) got &s;ooner through than in an Hour, after we had drawn our Ship a little back into the deep Stream, to the great Admiration of the <HI>Arabians</HI>: But the other, in our Company, did not &s;tick much longer, yet we had more to do to get her off, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;horter, with a hollow Bottom, wherefore &s;he was &s;ooner turned, but could not be got out &s;o well as ours which was flat-bottom'd. In the Evening very early we &s;aw at a great di&s;tance on the other &s;ide in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> a Ca&s;tle in the Plain, called <HI>Sere,</HI> which the <HI>Arabians</HI> (as they &s;ay) have many Years ago demoli&s;hed, which the River <HI>Chabu,</HI> which is pretty large, runs by, which beginneth not much above the Ca&s;tle (which one may gue&s;s by its Fre&s;h-Water like unto Fountain-Water) and runs a little way below into the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI> From thence we thought to have reached <HI>Errachaby,</HI> a Town belonging to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> but being hindred in our Navigation, as is above-mentioned, we landed a little above this before the Night befell us, and went the next Morning early to the before-mentio|ned Town, which was pretty large, and lay about half a League from the River in a very fruitful Country, where we &s;tayed until the next Day, to &s;ell &s;ome Goods there. Wherefore two of ours went into the Town to call out &s;ome of their Merchants to trade with them.</P>
<P>After they had &s;pent that whole Day with them, we went off the next Morning early toward <HI>Schara,</HI> a little Village which lieth on the Right-Hand half a League di&s;tant from the River, belonging to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> where we landed to pay the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom. All about the Sides and the River I &s;aw a great many Bu&s;hes and Trees. I would fain have been at them
<PB N="163" REF="97">
to di&s;cern what they were, that I might have viewed them exactly, but I was forced to &s;tay in the Ship and &s;o I mi&s;&s;ed them. From <HI>Schara</HI> our Navigation went on for &s;everal Days very well, but chiefly through &s;andy De&s;arts which were as large as any we had be|fore pa&s;&s;ed; for they extended &s;ometimes &s;o far, that we could not &s;ee the end of them; and they were &s;o dry, that you could &s;ee neither Plough-land nor Mea|dow, Tree nor Bu&s;h, Leaf nor Gra&s;s, nor Path to go in; wherefore the&s;e may very well be called De|&s;arts, which are al&s;o called the &s;andy Seas. Fir&s;t you mu&s;t expect there great Storms, as well as in the Seas, which cau&s;e Waves in the Sand as well as at Sea; then tho&s;e that go in great Caravans through them, mu&s;t have their Leader or Pilot (by them called <HI>Caliphi</HI>) as well as tho&s;e at Sea, which knows how to direct their way by the Compa&s;s, as Pilots do on Ship-board. Then they provide them&s;elves (becau&s;e the way is very long through them) with Victuals for a long time, as well as tho&s;e that go by Sea, wherefore they load generally the third Part of their Camels with Provi&s;ions, chief|ly with Water, to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and their Bea&s;ts, in the great heat of the Sun, for throughout all the De&s;arts there is never a Spring to be found, except one &s;hould light by chance on a Ci&s;tern, which yet are al&s;o generally dry, for nothing but the Rain filleth them. The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperours have ordered 30000 of the&s;e Ci&s;terns to be dug in the Ground in the&s;e De&s;arts (as I was informed when I was at <HI>Aleppo</HI>) and to be provided with Water, that their Armies when they marched from place to place in tho&s;e times when they had War with the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Arabia, &amp;c.</HI> might not want for Water, and if one &s;hould be empty they might perhaps find &s;ome in the others. In the&s;e Wilderne&s;&s;es I &s;aw nothing worth &s;peaking of, but on the 9th. of <HI>October,</HI> &s;ome ancient Turrets that &s;tood upon the high Banks on a Point, called <HI>Eu&s;y,</HI> where, as &s;ome &s;ay, hath been formerly a Famous Town. There|about the River taketh &s;o large a Circumference, that we went longer than half a Day, before we could pa&s;s it. By the &s;ame River below us, we &s;aw on the other
<PB N="164" REF="98">
Side of it &s;everal <HI>Arabians</HI> on Hor&s;e-back: And no|thing el&s;e remarkable, but as I have told you before, &s;ome &s;mall Hutts of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who came to &s;ee us often, but chiefly at Night-time, to pilfer &s;omething, which they are u&s;ed to from their Infancy. Wherefore it be|hoved us to have great Care, and to keep a good Watch, as I did find it the &s;ame Night: For when it was come to my Turn to &s;tand Sentinel again, which I commonly did in the hindermo&s;t part of the Ship on high, that I might e&s;py the Thieves the &s;ooner if any &s;hould come, I laid down by me a good Cud|gel (as we all u&s;ed to do every time) &s;o I lay down and wrap'd my &s;elf up in a Frize Coat with hanging Sleeves to it, to keep my &s;elf from the Fro&s;t and Dew, which are very frequent and violent there. After long watch|ing, I began to be drow&s;y and fell a&s;leep, a Thief came through the Water to the Ship, where I was laid down very &s;ilently, and took hold of one of my Sleeves that hung down, in hopes to draw out the Coat gently, not knowing that I was in it: So I was &s;en&s;ible that Some|body was there that would &s;teal the Coat, and got up, and &s;eeing the Head of the Rogue, I took hold of my long Cudgel, to have a Blow at him; but he was too nimble for me, &s;wam back and ran away: The re&s;t that lay by me were awakened at this, and did per|ceive that I had &s;een Some-body, but did not know the Particulars, &s;o they were very glad that I had frightned away the Thief, and gave me Thanks for my great Care and diligent watching. As the <HI>Moors</HI> by Night follow their Robbery, &s;o they came by Day|light often with their Wives to trade with us. Where|fore our Ma&s;ter &s;ometimes to plea&s;e &s;ome Merchants, did &s;ooner land, who took all &s;orts of Goods out with them; as Soap-balls, Beads of Chry&s;tal, and yellow Agates, Gla&s;s-Rings of &s;everal Colours, which they wear on their Hands and Feet; and &s;everal other Toys made of Red, Yellow, Green and Blew Gla&s;s; and &s;et in Tin Bra&s;s or Lead, high Shooes, which are tied with Leathern Straps at the Top, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the&s;e Goods they trucked with the <HI>Moors</HI> for Sheep's Skins, Buck-skins, Chee&s;e-Curds, and &s;everal other Things, and &s;ometimes for
<PB N="165" REF="98">
Money. The&s;e <HI>Moors</HI> do not differ much in their Form from our Gyp&s;ies, only that the&s;e are a good deal Browner. They are very nimble in their Actions, but they do not much care to work; they rather &s;pend their time in idle Di&s;cour&s;es, or begin to quarrel with one another, with loud and big Words, and a great Clamour, but &s;eldom are &s;o much in earne&s;t as to come to Blows. Their Heads are &s;haved &s;aving only the Crown, where they let generally a long Lock grow, like unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> that hangeth down be|hind. As to their Cloathing they wore Coats, made of Cour&s;e Stuff, whole before, and without Sleeves; they are pretty long before, and reach to their Knees, &s;uch an one I wore on my Journey, &s;triped with White and Black; underneath they have long Shirts, which are cut out about the Necks, and reach down to their Ankles, they are commonly Blew, and have wide Sleeves, which they let fly about, chiefly in their walk|ing, when they fling their Arms about to &s;hew their Pride. The&s;e Shirts they gird up with broad Leathern Girdles &s;o high, that you cannot &s;ee the Girdle, but only their bended Dagger that &s;ticks or hangs in them, as we wear our Swords. The Archers put &s;ometimes one of their Arms out of their Shirts, and &s;o leave their Brea&s;t bare at the &s;ame time, that they may &s;hoot and fight the freer without being hindred; tho&s;e that are not able to buy Shooes, take in&s;tead of them Necks of undre&s;&s;ed Skins, and put them about their Feet with the Hair outwards, and &s;o tye or lace them up. The Men wear no Breeches, but the Women do, and they come down to their Ankles: Their Faces are not veiled, as the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Womens, but el&s;e they cover them&s;elves with broad Scarfs, which more incline to Blew than to White, and let them (chiefly tho&s;e that wear nar|row ones) hang behind in a great knot. When they have a mind to be fine, they put on their precious things (as are Marbles, Amber Beads, Gla&s;&s;es of &s;everal Colours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) fixed to Laces and hang them down their Tem|ples, which come down about a Span long, and fly a|bout from Face to Neck, &s;o that in bending or moving their Head they often hurt their Face, and do not a
<PB N="166" REF="99">
little hinder them in their Actions. Tho&s;e that are of greater Sub&s;tance, and have a mind to be richer and finer in their Dre&s;s, wear Silver and Gold-Rings in one of their No&s;trils (as &s;ome do in one of their Ears in our Country) wherein are &s;et Garnets, Turquois, Rubies and Pearls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They al&s;o wear Rings about their Legs and Hands, and &s;ometimes a good many together, which in their &s;tepping and working, &s;lip up and down about their Hands and Feet, and &s;o make a great noi&s;e. So much I thought convenient to relate of the Inhabitants of the&s;e Countries and De&s;arts, as I have &s;een and found it.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed through the great De&s;arts, and began to come prety near unto <HI>Ana,</HI> our Ma&s;ter land|ed early in the Evening in a very plea&s;ant Place which was about a League and a half on this Side of the Town, where we &s;tayed all Night: For the River is very dangerous to navigate becau&s;e of its &s;wift Cur|rent, and &s;ome Rocks that lie between the Mountains&punc; This Place was &s;o plea&s;ant by Rea&s;on of its fruitful Trees, <HI>viz.</HI> Olive-Trees, Orange, Citron, Limon, Pomgranate, and chiefly Date-Trees, that the like I had not &s;een before in my Travels, and hard by it was a very thick Wood of Date-Trees, whereinto I went with &s;ome of our Company, and found &s;o great a Quantity of Fruit that they did not e&s;teem them at all, and a|mong them we found two new Sorts different from them that u&s;e to be brought to us in our Countries, <HI>viz.</HI> quite Red, and Yellow ones, by <HI>Serapio</HI> called <HI>Hayron,</HI> in his 69th <HI>Chapter</HI>; which although &s;omething le&s;s than ours, yet are very good, and of a delicate Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The next Morning we recommended the Ship to the Ma&s;ter, and walked (the Ship being pretty well laden) to the Town. By the way we found concer|ning Fruitfulne&s;s &s;o great a Difference, that we could really &s;ay, we were come from the barren and de&s;o|lated <HI>Arabia</HI> (which hitherto had continued from <HI>Dir,</HI> nay very near from <HI>Aleppo</HI>) into the well cultivated and fruitful one. For ju&s;t in the very Entrance there appeared Fields &s;own with Cotton, which was as tender and woolly as one could any where find: Then delicate
<PB N="167" REF="99">
Fields of Corn which grew very high, and was full ripe, and fit to be cut down: Then Trees that &s;tood round about, full of Fruit, &s;o that we had a very plea&s;ant Walk to the Town. In this way I &s;aw no &s;trange Plants at all, onely in the Corn the <HI>Moluchi</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> whereof I have made mention before, which is e&s;teemed to be the <HI>Corchorum Plinii</HI>; and al&s;o another, which becau&s;e of its Height is ea&s;ily &s;een; this is very like unto the <HI>Se&s;amum,</HI> onely that the Stalk is longer and fatter, the Leaves are rougher, and the uppermo&s;t ones are cut into three different ones, which is not to be &s;een in the uppermo&s;t Leaves of the <HI>Se&s;amum,</HI> the Leaves whereof are more like unto Willow-Leaves both in Length and Colour: Between the Leaves that &s;tand &s;ingly about the Stalk one above the other, &s;prout out &s;tately Flowers, which are Yellow without, and intermixt with Red Veins, and of a purple brown Colour within, and have a long Style or Pointel in the middle thereof; when the&s;e are fall'n off, there grow long Pods out of them, about a Finger long and thick, which are hairy without, pointed towards the Top, and have Five Di&s;tinctions within, wherein the &s;eeds are con|tained (which are very like unto the &s;ort of Malva that is called <HI>Abutilon</HI>) and are placed in good Order one above the other. I did very much enquire after this plant, but they know no other Name for it, but <HI>Lubie Endigi,</HI> that is <HI>Indian</HI> Kidney-Beans: But according to my Knowledge, I rather take it to be the <HI>Trio|num,</HI> whereof <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> maketh mention in &s;everal Places.</P>
<P>The Town <HI>Ana</HI> is by the <HI>Euphrates</HI> divided into Two Parts, or rather into Two Towns, whereof the One is not very big, and &s;ubject to the <HI>Turk,</HI> and is very well guarded with old Walls, and &s;o &s;urrounded by the River, that you cannot go into it but by Boats, but the other that lieth on this Side, belongeth to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> is very great, and very ill-provided with Walls and Ditches, &s;o that you may go in and out by Night, as in all other Towns belonging to him. This, and al&s;o the whole Province, is called <HI>Gimel,</HI> and

is fifteen Days Journey di&s;tant from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and goeth down a great way the River, &s;o that we had a good Hour to go, before we came to the Hou&s;e of our Ma|&s;ter, which was near the Harbour, where our Ship did lie. The Hou&s;es are built with Brick and Stone Walls, and very well done; and we could hardly &s;ee one on either &s;ide but what had a Garden to it, planted with <HI>Dates, Limon, Citron,</HI> and <HI>Pomgranate</HI> Trees, with de|licate Fruit in it. At the other &s;ide on the left in <HI>Me|&s;opotamia,</HI> I &s;aw nothing but &s;ome Summer-hou&s;es &s;tanding about the Hills. By the way before we came to <HI>Ana,</HI> I ob&s;erved very well, that &s;ome of our Com|pany (to whom I was of an Outlandi&s;h Man recom|mended) left me, and began to contrive with the Ma|&s;ter, who was born in that Town, to accu&s;e me by a &s;econd Hand, that they might not be &s;een in it, as a Spy, before the Magi&s;trates, pretending that I ob&s;erved all Towns and Places accurately, and had a mind to betray them at my Opportunity, which they chiefly did to frighten me, and &s;o to get the &s;ooner &s;ome good Booty out of me. In Order whereunto, &s;ome of them went to the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;haw,</HI> and obtained pre&s;ently of him to &s;end one of his Servants with them, which came to me in the long Street, having &s;ome Iron Chains and Fetters in his Hands, which he let hang down upon the Ground, and led me along; &s;o that I pre&s;ently under|&s;tood that they had an ill Intention again&s;t me, which they intended to execute. So I went along with him, to &s;ee what they would do with me; when they came to the Harbour, they gave me leave to go into the Ship, and to &s;tay there until I heard more of them. So they &s;oon aggreed together, and told me, chiefly one of them that was on Hor&s;e-back in a long Furr'd Coat, that if I would be at Liberty, I mu&s;t pay to the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;haw</HI> 500 Ducats. When I was con&s;idering the&s;e things, and &s;aw my &s;elf al&s;o left quite alone, and their Demands &s;o extraordinary unrea&s;onable, and found my &s;elf in this great Nece&s;&s;ity and Danger, it came into my mind, that there was another Magi&s;trate in the other Town <HI>Ana,</HI> at the other &s;ide of the River, which was a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> one, to whom I would make my

Complaint of their unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable Impo|&s;ition, to &s;ee whether I might not find help and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of them, wherefore I provided my &s;elf with my Pa&s;s, and fitted my &s;elf &s;o in Cloaths that I might be able to &s;wim, &s;o that if they &s;hould A&s;&s;ault me to take hold of me, I might &s;oon make my e&s;cape over the River without any oppo&s;ition or hindering. At length, when they expected my An&s;wer, and the Mo|ney, I told them my Intention plainly and clearly, which put them into greater Fright and Fear, than they had put me in before. Wherefore they gave over their unju&s;t Demands, and de&s;ired of the 500 Ducats, no more but a &s;ingle one, which they were forc'd to give to the Servant of the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;haw,</HI> for the Pains he had taken.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter the de&s;igned Storm, that &s;hould have be|fallen me was over, and I by the Power of the Almighty God delivered, as it hath plea&s;ed him to do with a great many more, (which would be too long to relate all here) we immediately departed from thence on the 15th. of <HI>October.</HI> A little below it we found a fruitful and well cultivated Country; and &s;ome fine Hou&s;es &s;tanding here and there, &s;o near to|gether, that before we pa&s;&s;ed one, we could &s;ee ano|ther, which had al&s;o their Orchards and Kitchin-Gardens, and round about them fine Woods of <HI>Date</HI>-Trees,
<PB N="170" REF="101">
and many others, which I could not di&s;cern be|cau&s;e it was too far off; &s;o that we found a great Al|teration, and our Wilderne&s;s (wherein, chiefly at a Di&s;tance from the River, we hardly &s;aw a Tree in a whole day) changed at the lower end of the Town in|to a fertile Soil: Wherefore our Voyage was very plea&s;ant to us, for we had al&s;o le&s;s danger to fear from the <HI>Arabians.</HI> But our Ma&s;ter was very much troubled, becau&s;e the River was often &s;top'd up at the Sides with great Stones that made the River &s;well, for there was a great Number of large and high Water-Engines or Wheels, therefore the&s;e Stones were laid to lead the Stream to them, to make them work, for it often happen'd that Two of them &s;tood clo&s;e together, which took up &s;o much of the River, that we had hardly room to pa&s;s by them in the middle of the Stream, wherefore he was forced to have great Care, to find the right way where he might pa&s;s without Danger. The Rea&s;on why the&s;e Water-Wheels are &s;o much in U&s;e is, becau&s;e this River doth not overflow (as the River <HI>Nilus</HI>) to water the Grounds, neither doth it rain enough here &s;ufficiently to moi&s;ten the Seeds and Garden-Plants, that they be not burnt by the great Heat of the Sun, wherefore they mu&s;t look out for &s;uch Means, as will &s;upply this Want. To do this they erect Water-Wheels (whereof Three or Four &s;tand behind one another) in the River, which go Night and Day, and dip up Water out of the River, which is emptied into peculiar Chanals, that are pre|pared on purpo&s;e, to water all the Ground. But if the Places lie not conveniently, or the Shore be too high to erect &s;uch Wheels, they make in&s;tead of them Bridges and peculiar Engines, that are turned by a Couple of Bullocks, to bring the Water up, with great Leathern Buckets, which are wide at Top and narrow at Bottom. This Land being &s;o fruitful, we &s;oon found, to our great Plea&s;ure, great Quantities of delicate Fruit, &s;old for a &s;mall Matter of Money, and among the re&s;t chiefly <HI>Indian</HI> Musk-Melons, that were very well ta&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="101">When we came further we had generally even ground at both Sides, and not a few Fields, the mo&s;t Part whereof, were &s;own with <HI>Indian-Millet,</HI> for they &s;ow more of this than of Wheat or Barley, for the Sand is pretty deep, wherein the Corn would not grow &s;o well. This <HI>Millet</HI> was ju&s;t fit to be cut down, and in &s;ome Places they had it in already. It &s;hoots up into a high Stalk about Six, Seven, or Eight Cubits high, the Leaves thereof are like unto the <HI>Indian</HI>-Corn, or Sugar-Reeds, which I took it for at Fir&s;t, and that becau&s;e the Inhabitants did chaw it as well as the Sugar-Canes, becau&s;e of the &s;weet and plea&s;ant Juice (which is more in the upper Part of the Cane, whereas that of the Sugar-Canes is more in the lower) which they draw out of it, untill I &s;aw at length their white hairy Tops &s;prout out, which are large and not unlike to the <HI>Italian-Millet.</HI> The&s;e are full of whiti&s;h Grains, each of which &s;ticks between Two broad flying Leaves, of the Bigne&s;s of tho&s;e of the <HI>Orabus,</HI> yet &s;omewhat more compre&s;&s;ed at the Sides. Hereof they bake very well-ta&s;ted Bread and Cakes, and &s;ome of them are rowled very thin, and laid together like unto a Letter, &s;o that they are about Four Inches broad, Six long, and Two thick; they are of an A&s;hen Colour. The Inhabitants call it &s;till at this Day by its ancient <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Name <HI>Dora,</HI> whereof <HI>Rha&s;es</HI> maketh mention, he that will may read more of it in Authors.</P>
<P>Our Voyage went on very well, wherefore the Mer|chants began &s;everal Pa&s;times, &s;ome did play at a Play called the Eighteenth, and others played at Che&s;s, in which Two Games they were very well ver&s;ed; others &s;pent their time in Reading and Singing. Among the re&s;t there was a Merchant from <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> that &s;ung out of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> (which was put into Rhymes in the com|mon <HI>Arabick</HI>) &s;everal times with a loud and delicate Voice; &s;o that I took great Delight in hearing him. Yet they were not &s;o hot in their Gaming or Je&s;ting, that they &s;hould therefore forget the Hour of their Prayers, chiefly their Divines that were in Orders, which u&s;ed to call them out with a loud Voice, at the u&s;ual Hour, either in the Ship, or without in the De|&s;arts,
<PB N="172" REF="102">
if they could have convenient Time and Oppor|tunity. But among the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> I found a greater Zeal and Earne&s;tne&s;s, than among the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> all which Nation have notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame Cere|monies in their Prayers. For as they have chiefly Five Hours of Praying, whereof Three are in the Day-time; <HI>viz.</HI> the Fir&s;t about Noon, the Second about Three, and the Third when the Sun begins to &s;et, the two others in the Night, one in the Morning an Hour and half before the Sun ri&s;eth, and the Second after Sun &s;et when the Firmament begins to look white and the Stars to appear: So the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> would not be hindered, by the Darkne&s;s of the Night, Danger of the Place, Inconveniency of the Time, to go out, when the o|thers were a&s;leep, on the Ground in the I&s;land where we were landed, and &s;ay their Prayers with &s;uch an Earne&s;tne&s;s and Devotion, as I have often &s;een it, that the Tears run out of their Eyes: I mu&s;t al&s;o needs &s;ay that they keep clo&s;er and &s;tricter to their Laws than almo&s;t any other Nation, which forbid them to drink Wine, and command them to live in Poverty, and to watch and pray continually.</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Day of <HI>October</HI> we came early to <HI>Hadidt,</HI> a pretty large, yet anciently built Town, belonging to the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> which is al&s;o di|vided into two Towns by the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> like unto <HI>Ana,</HI> whereof the greater part lieth on this Side of the River. Here the Ma&s;ter payed for his Ship two <HI>Sayet,</HI> (one whereof is about Three-Pence in our Country) to the Cu&s;tomers, and &s;o &s;et Sail again, to try whether he could reach that Night to <HI>Juppe</HI>: And he did oftner than ever before, &s;peak to his Men to pull on (chiefly where the River in its Breadth and Depth was almo&s;t like unto the Sea) &s;o that at Night pretty late we arrived at <HI>Juppe,</HI> a plea&s;ant and well built Town belonging to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and it is al&s;o di|vided into two Parts, whereof one lieth in the middle of the River on a high Ground, at the Top whereof is a Fortre&s;s, &s;o the Town is pretty well defended: The other (which is rather bigger) lieth on the le&s;t in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> wherein are many fine Orchards belong|ing
<PB N="173" REF="102">
to the Hou&s;es, full of high Date-Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where|fore the Merchants &s;pent half a Day there to buy Dates, Almonds, and Figs to carry with them into the Inns; the &s;ame they did at <HI>Idt</HI> another great Town of the <HI>Turks,</HI> on the Right-hand of the <HI>Euphrates</HI> &s;ituate on a high Ground, where we arrived on the 20th of <HI>October</HI> at Night in very good Time, and gave them in&s;tead thereof Soap-balls, Knives, and Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After which goods they have often enquired of us; and we have given them &s;ometimes &s;ome Sheets of white Paper, which they received with great Joy, and returned us many thanks for them.</P>
<P>After our Merchants had &s;ufficiently &s;tored them|&s;elves with the&s;e Goods, and our Ma&s;ter had pay'd the Duty for his two Ships, he put off about Noon on the 21&s;t of <HI>October</HI> and went away. About the Evening we &s;aw at this Side of the River a Mill, and al&s;o the next Day another, whereby were &s;everal old Walls Doors and Arches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereby I conjecture that formerly there &s;tood a Town. The&s;e two Mills (as I was informed were two Powder-Mills that make Gun-powder for the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, and &s;end it to him in Caravans, together with other Merchandizes through the Dominions of the King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> wherefore he mu&s;t as well as other Merchants, pay Duty (for that Liberty) and Toll or Cu&s;tom. The Gun-powder is not made from Salt-Peter, as ours is, but out of ano|ther Juice, which they take from a Tree that is reckon'd to be a kind of Willow; known to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> by the Name of <HI>Fer,</HI> and to the <HI>Arabians</HI> by <HI>Garb,</HI> as I have mentioned above. Be&s;ides this they take the &s;mall Twigs of the&s;e Trees together with the Leaves, and burn them to Powder, which they put into Water to &s;eparate the Salt from it, and &s;o make Gun-powder thereof, yet this is nothing near &s;o &s;trong as ours. <HI>Pliny</HI> chiefly te&s;tifieth this in his 31&s;t Book and 10th Chapter, where he &s;aith that in former Days they have made Niter of Oak-Trees, (which certainly he hath taken the&s;e to be, for they are pretty like Oaks) but that it hath been given over long before now. Which is very probable, chiefly becau&s;e the Con&s;ump|tion
<PB N="174" REF="103">
thereof was not &s;o great, before they found out Guns, as it is now &s;ince they have been found out.</P>
<P>Further on the Water-&s;ide, on the high Banks, I &s;aw an innumerable many Coloquints grow and hang down, which at a di&s;tance I could not well know, un|til they called them by their ancient <HI>Arabick</HI> Name <HI>Handbel,</HI> whereby they &s;till to this Day are known to the Inhabitants. After we had navigated a great way &s;everal Days one after another, through even Grounds, and in a good Road, we arrived at length on the 24th.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Village <HI>Elugo</HI> lyeth on the place where for|merly Old <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Chaldee,</HI> did &s;tand; the Harbour lyeth a quarter of a League off, whereinto tho&s;e u&s;e to go, that intend to travel by Land, to the Famous trading City of <HI>Bagdet,</HI> (which is &s;ituated further to the Ea&s;t on the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> at a Day and a half's di&s;tance). At this Harbour is the place where the Old Town of <HI>Babylon</HI> did &s;tand, but at this time&punc; there is not a Hou&s;e to be &s;een, whereinto we could go with our Goods and &s;tay till our de|parture. We were al&s;o forced to unload our Mer|chandi&s;es into an open Place, as if we had been in the
<PB N="175" REF="103">
mid&s;t of the De&s;arts, and to pay Toll under the open Sky, which belongeth to the <HI>Turks.</HI> This Country is &s;o dry and barren, that it cannot be tilled, and &s;o bare, that I &s;hould have doubted very much, whether this Potent and Powerful City (which once was the mo&s;t Stately and Famous one of the World, &s;ituated in the plea&s;ant and fruitful Country of <HI>Sinar</HI>) did &s;tand there, if I &s;hould not have known it by its Situation, and &s;e|veral ancient and Delicate Antiquities that &s;till are &s;tanding hereabout in great De&s;olation. Fir&s;t by the Old Bridge, which was laid over the <HI>Euphrates</HI> (which al&s;o is called <HI>Sud</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Baruch</HI> in his fir&s;t Chapter) whereof there are &s;ome Pieces and Arches &s;till remaining, and to be &s;een at this very Day a little a|bove where we landed. The&s;e Arches are built of burnt Brick, and &s;o &s;trong, that it is admirable; and that &s;o much the more, becau&s;e all along the River as we came from <HI>Bir,</HI> where the River is a great deal &s;maller, we &s;aw never a Bridge, wherefore I &s;ay it is admirable, which way they could build a Bridge here, where the River is at lea&s;t half a League broad, and very deep be&s;ides. Near the Bridge are &s;everal heaps of <HI>Babylonian</HI> Pitch, to pitch Ships withal, which is in &s;ome places grown &s;o hard, that you may walk over it, but in others that which hath been lately brought thither is &s;o &s;oft, that you may &s;ee every &s;tep you make in it. Something farther, ju&s;t before the Village <HI>Elugo</HI> is the Hill whereon the Ca&s;tle did &s;tand in a Plain, whereon you may &s;till &s;ee &s;ome Ruines of the Fortification, which is quite demoli&s;hed and uninha|bited: behind it pretty near to it, did &s;tand the Tower of <HI>Babylon,</HI> which the Children of <HI>Noah</HI> (who fir&s;t in|habited the&s;e Countries after the Deluge) began to build up unto Heaven; this we &s;ee &s;till, and it is half a League in Diameter, but it is &s;o mightily ruined, and low, and &s;o full of Vermin that have bored holes through it, that one may not come near it within half a Mile, but only in two Months in the Winter, when they come not out of their holes. Among the&s;e In|&s;ects, there are chiefly &s;ome in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Language called <HI>Eglo,</HI> by the Inhabitants, that are very poy&s;o|nous;
<PB N="176" REF="104">
they are (as others told me) bigger than our Lizards, and have <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter"><HI>Rauwolff</HI> was here too credulous and facil to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be abu&s;ed and im|po&s;ed upon by the&s;e Relaters; for that there neither are, nor ever were any Animals with more Heads than one naturally, I do confidently affirm.</NOTE> three Heads, and on their Back &s;everal Spots of &s;everal Colours, which have not only taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Tower, but al&s;o of the Ca|&s;tle (which is not very high) and the Spring-well, that is ju&s;t underneath it, &s;o that they cannot live upon the Hill, nor dare not drink of the Water (which is whole&s;ome for the Lambs.) <HI>This is Romance.</HI></P>
<P>From this Tower, at two Leagues di&s;tance Ea&s;tward, lieth the &s;trong Town <HI>Traxt,</HI> which was formerly called <HI>Apamia,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> in <HI>Book</HI> VI. 26 and 27 <HI>Chap.</HI> between the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> tho&s;e two great Rivers of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> whereof is made mention in the Second Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>; which two Rivers not far below it meet together, and are there united. The Town <HI>Traxt</HI> is &s;urrounded with Ditches, and very well defended by two &s;trong Citadels, that lie on each &s;ide thereof, &s;o that it is (as it were a Key and Door|way into the Kingdom of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to which it doth al&s;o belong, as others not far from thence, viz, <HI>Orthox, Laigen,</HI> which lie on the Road toward <HI>Media</HI>; and al&s;o <HI>Goa</HI> (which lieth a League and a half at the other &s;ide of the <HI>Tigris,</HI>) and <HI>Axt</HI> (two Leagues further &s;till) in the way to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, the 25th. of <HI>October,</HI> we &s;pent in be|&s;peaking of Camels and A&s;&s;es to load our Goods upon, and after we were quite ready, we broke up the Day following early in the Morning with the whole <HI>Ca|ravan,</HI> to travel to <HI>Bagdet.</HI> In the beginning the ways were very rough of the Stones and Ruines that lie &s;till from thence di&s;per&s;ed. But after we were pa&s;&s;ed the Ca&s;tle and al&s;o the Town of <HI>Daniel,</HI> the dry De&s;arts began again, where nothing was to be &s;een but Thorns, neither Men nor Bea&s;ts, neither Caves nor Tents, &s;o that a Man that knoweth the ways never &s;o well, hath enough to do to find them through it, which I did often ob&s;erve in our Guide or <HI>Caliphi,</HI> who did &s;eve|ral
<PB N="177" REF="104">
times (becau&s;e there was neither way nor mark nei|ther of Men nor Bea&s;ts to be found) very much doubt which way to turn him&s;elf, and &s;o he did more than once turn &s;ometimes towards one, then toward the other &s;ide the whole Caravan. By the way we &s;aw in the Plain many large, ancient, high and &s;tately Buildings, Arches and Turrets &s;tanding in the Sand (which is very fine, and lieth clo&s;e together, as you find it in the Vallies) here and there, whereof many were decayed and lay like Ruines; &s;ome to look upon, were pretty entire, very &s;trong, adorned with Artificial Works, &s;o that they were very well worth to have been narrowlier looked into. Thus they &s;tand &s;olitary and de&s;olated, &s;ave only the Steeple of <HI>Daniel,</HI> which is entire, built of black Stones, and is inhabited &s;till un|to this Day; this is in height and building &s;omething like unto our Steeple of the <HI>Holy-Cro&s;s</HI> Church, or of St. <HI>Maurice</HI> in <HI>Augsburg</HI>; on which as it &s;tands by it &s;elf, you may &s;ee all the Ruines of the Old <HI>Babylonian</HI> Tower, the Ca&s;tle-Hill, together with the &s;tately Buildings, and the whole Situation of the Old Town very exactly.</P>
<P>After we had travelled for Twelve Hours through de&s;olate places, very hard, &s;o that our Camels and A&s;&s;es began to be tired under their heavy Burdens, we re&s;ted and lodged our &s;elves near to an a&s;cent, we and our Bea&s;ts, to refre&s;h our &s;elves, and &s;o to &s;tay there till Night, and to break up again in the middle thereof, that we might come to <HI>Bagdet</HI> before Sun ri&s;ing. The mean while, when we were lodged there, I con&s;idered and viewed this a&s;cent, and found that there was two behind one another, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a Ditch, and ex|tending them&s;elves like unto two parallel Walls a great way about, and that they were open in &s;ome Places, where one might go through, like Gates; wherefore I believe, that they were the Wall of the Old Town (whereof <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ays that they were 200 Foot high, and 50 broad) that went about there, and that the places where they were open, have been anciently the Gates (whereof there were a Hundred Iron ones) of that Town; and this the rather, becau&s;e I &s;aw in &s;ome places under the
<PB N="178" REF="105">
Sand (wherewith the two a&s;cents were almo&s;t covered) the Old Wall plainly appear. So we found our &s;elves to be ju&s;t lodged without the Walls of that formerly &s;o Famous Kingly City, which now with its Magnificent and Glorious Buildings, is quite de&s;olated and lieth in the Du&s;t, &s;o that every one that pa&s;&s;eth through it, in regard of them, hath great rea&s;on to admire with a&s;toni&s;hment, when he con&s;iders, that this which hath been &s;o Glorious an one; and in which the Greate&s;t Monarchs and Kings that ever were, <HI>Nimrod, Belus,</HI> and after him King <HI>Merodach</HI> and his Po&s;terity to <HI>Bal|tha&s;ar</HI> the la&s;t, have had their Seats and Habitations, is now reduced to &s;uch a De&s;olation and Wilderne&s;s, that the very Shepherds cannot abide to fix their Tents there to inhabit it.

<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed by, I found &s;ome Thorns growing in the Sand, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Acacia,</HI> called <HI>Agul,</HI> whereon (chiefly in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>) the <HI>Manna</HI> falls, whereof I have made men|tion before; above all I found in great Plenty &s;ome &s;trange kinds of <HI>Cali</HI> of <HI>Serap.,</HI> of Coloquints, and when Evening fell in, and the Night did approach, our Mockeries that drove the A&s;&s;es, made them&s;elves ready again for our Journey, which kept every thing to|gether in good Order, and were &s;o quick in loading and unloading, that they were ready in le&s;s than a quar|ter of an Hour.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Famous City of</HI> Bagdet, <HI>called</HI> Bal|dac; <HI>of its Situation, &s;trange Plants, great Traffick, and Merchants of &s;everal Na|tions, that live there, together with &s;eve|ral other things, I &s;aw and did learn at my departing.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Town <HI>Bagdet,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, is &s;ituated on the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly part of his Dominions, on the rapid River <HI>Tigris,</HI> and the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in a large Plain, almo&s;t like unto <HI>Ba&s;le</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> it is divided into Two Parts, which are rather bigger than <HI>Ba&s;le,</HI> but nothing near &s;o plea&s;ant, nor &s;o well built, for the Streets thereof are pretty narrow, and many Hou&s;es &s;o mi&s;erably built, that &s;ome of them are down to the fir&s;t Story, and o|thers lie quite in Ruines: The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the Churches, which for age look black, and are &s;o much decayed, that you &s;hall hardly find a whole one; whereon are &s;till &s;everal Old <HI>Arabian,</HI> or rather <HI>Chal|dean</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="106">
In&s;criptions to be &s;een, cut out in Stone, by the means whereof many Antiquities of the Town might have been truly explained, but I could not only not read them, but could get no body that could interpet them to me. There are &s;ome Buildings that are worth &s;ee|ing, as the <HI>Camp</HI> of the <HI>Turki&s;h Ba&s;haw,</HI> and the great <HI>Batzar</HI> or <HI>Exchange</HI> beyond the River in the other Town, and the <HI>Baths</HI> which are not to be com|pared with tho&s;e of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Tripoli,</HI> for they are at the bottom and on the Walls done over with Pitch, which maketh them &s;o black and dark, that even in the Day time, you have but little Light. There being two Towns, one of them which lieth on this &s;ide is quite open, &s;o that you may go in and out by Night without any mole&s;tation; wherefore it &s;hould rather be called a great Village than a Town; but the other that lieth towards <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> on the Confines of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> is very well Fortified with Walls and Ditches, chiefly towards the <HI>Tigris,</HI> where there are al&s;o &s;ome Towers, two whereof are within by the Gates that lead towards the Water-&s;ide, to guard them, and between them are the old high Walls of the Town, whereon on the top are &s;tately Writings, with Golden Letters, each whereof is about a Foot long, to be &s;een; the true meaning thereof, I would fain have learned, but for want of Under&s;tanding and Interpreters, I could not obtain it, but was forced to go without it. Near unto it there is a Bridge made of Boats that reacheth over the <HI>Tigris</HI> into the other Town, which in that place is about as broad, as the <HI>Rhine</HI> is at <HI>Stra&s;burg,</HI> and becau&s;e of its rapid Stream &s;o dark and dull, that it is a di&s;mal &s;ight to look upon it, and may ea&s;ily turn a Man's Head and make him giddy. This River runneth not much below the Town into the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and &s;o they run mixt together into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, by the Town <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> which is &s;ix Days Journey di&s;tant from thence Ea&s;tward. The&s;e two Towns as is &s;aid, at the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> were many Years agon, built out of the rui|nated City of <HI>Babylon,</HI> whereof the one on the other &s;ide of the River is accompted to be the Town of <HI>Se|leucia</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and that on this &s;ide, which is more
<PB N="181" REF="106">
like unto an open Village, is believed to be the Town <HI>Cte&s;iphonta. Strabo</HI> in his <HI>Book</HI> XV. doth te&s;tifie this, when he writes thus of them; That <HI>Babylon</HI> hath for|merly been the Metropolis of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> and that after its deva&s;tation, the Town of <HI>Seleucia,</HI> &s;ituated upon the <HI>Tigris,</HI> near which was a great Village, wherein the King of the <HI>Parthians</HI> did keep his Re&s;idence for the Winter. <HI>Pliny</HI> maketh al&s;o mention thereof in his Sixth Book, and in the 26th. and 27th. Chapter, <HI>viz.</HI> that the two Towns of <HI>Seleucia</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Cte&s;i|phonta</HI> were built out of the Ruines of the Old City, and that the River <HI>Tigris</HI> runs between them. In the Town <HI>Seleucia,</HI> &s;tands in a large place, the Ca&s;tle, which is without guarded neither with Walls nor Ditches, nor is quite fini&s;hed within. Before it lie &s;ome Pieces of Ordnance in the Road, which are &s;o daubed with Dirt, that they are almo&s;t quite covered. In it dwel|leth the <HI>Turki&s;h Ba&s;haw,</HI> who (when he under&s;tood that two Strangers were come into his Camp) &s;ent for us, and had us before him by his Men; along with us went freely an <HI>Armenian,</HI> whom we had known for|merly at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and to be our Interpreter, to give the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> a good and &s;ufficient account of us.</P>
<P>When we came into the Room of the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> (which was but very ordinary, yet &s;pread with delicate Tape|&s;try and well adorned) and appeared with accu&s;tomed Reverences, he asked us (&s;itting in his Co&s;tly yellow-coloured long Gown) by one of his Servants in <HI>French,</HI> which he did not under&s;tand very well, from what places we came, what Merchandi&s;es we had brought with us, and whither we intended to go. After we had punctually an&s;wered him to each Que&s;tion, yet he was not &s;atisfied, but bid us to withdraw, and &s;tay until we heard his An&s;wer. We under&s;tood his mean|ing very well, that it was only to &s;crue a Pre&s;ent out of us, yet we would not under&s;tand it, but &s;hewed him our Pa&s;s, &s;ub&s;cribed both by the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> and the <HI>Cadi</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> to try whether that would give him Content. So he took it and read it over, and looked very diligently upon their Seals, as they u&s;e to &s;eal
<PB N="182" REF="107">
(after they have dipped it fir&s;t into Ink) &s;o that all but the Letters is black. When he found them right, and did not know any more to &s;ay to us, he let us go, then we made him his Reverence again, and &s;o we went backwards out of his Lodgings, for if you turn your Back to any one (although it be a far meaner Per&s;on) they take it as a great uncivility, rudene&s;s, and di&s;pa|ragement. This <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> keeps a great Garri&s;on in the Town of <HI>Bagdet,</HI> becau&s;e it lieth on the Confines of <HI>Su&s;iana, Media,</HI> &amp;c. which are Provinces belonging to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> hath no|thing more towards the Ea&s;t of it to command. His greate&s;t Dominions are the Wilderne&s;&s;es of the De&s;art <HI>Arabia,</HI> whereof the <HI>Turk</HI> hath one Part, but the o|ther, and the bige&s;t belongs to the King of <HI>Arabia.</HI> After the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> had given us leave to go, we went to our Lodgings again, and bought by the way in the <HI>Batzar</HI> &s;ome Provi&s;ion to eat, and to boil for Supper, for in the&s;e Countries are no Inns to be found, where|into one may go, and find a Dinner ready prepared for Chance-Cu&s;tomers, as in our Country is done, except one would go into a Cook's Shop, whereof there are a great many in the <HI>Batzars</HI>; but every one boileth for him&s;elf what he hath a mind to, without Doors, be|fore his Lodgings, where there is a Chimny for that purpo&s;e, &s;o that in the Morning, and at Night when it is time to eat, you &s;ee every where in the Allies of the Camp &s;everal Fires. When we went to eat we were forced (becau&s;e in the&s;e Chambers is neither Ta|ble, nor Stools, nor Bench) to &s;it down on the Ground, and al&s;o lie upon it all Night, &s;o that our Cloaks were very u&s;eful to us, to &s;erve us in&s;tead of a Bed, chiefly in the Winter, to keep us warm, yet the Winter is not very &s;evere in tho&s;e Countries; which you may con|clude, for that our <HI>March</HI>-Flowers, <HI>Narci&s;&s;us's, Hy|acinths, Violets,</HI> &amp;c. were here full in Flowers in the Month of <HI>December</HI>; and that the Farmers went to Plough at that time; wherefore I judge that their Winter is like unto our Spring. When we lived at <HI>Bagdet,</HI> I found by our Catering, that the Scarcity was &s;till very con&s;iderable, and it would have been
<PB N="183" REF="107">
more, and have encrea&s;ed, if the Towns that lie above it on the <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tigris,</HI> and chiefly <HI>Mo&s;&s;el,</HI> which formerly went by the Name of <HI>Nineve,</HI> had not &s;ent them great Supplies, as did al&s;o tho&s;e of <HI>Ca|rahemit,</HI> &amp;c. which Supply they have al&s;o almo&s;t al|ways, at any other time, occa&s;ion for, for their cultiva|ted Grounds are chiefly in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> where they have almo&s;t none at all, &s;o that there groweth not enough to maintain them&s;elves; wherefore the two Rivers are very nece&s;&s;ary to them, not only to provide them with Victuals, as Corn, Wine, Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but al&s;o to bring to them all &s;orts of Merchandices, where|of many Ship-loads are brought in daily. So that in this Town there is a great Depo&s;ition of Merchandices (by rea&s;on of its commodious Situation) which are brought thither by Sea as well as by Land from &s;everal Parts, chiefly from <HI>Natolia, Syria, Armenia, Con&s;tanti|nople, Haleppo, Dama&s;cus,</HI> &amp;c. to carry them further into the <HI>Indies, Per&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. So it happened that during the time I was there, on the 2d. Day of <HI>December,</HI> in 74. there arrived 25 Ships with Spice and other pre|cious Drugs here, which came over Sea from the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the way of <HI>Ormutz,</HI> to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> a Town belonging to the <HI>Grand Turk,</HI> &s;ituated on the Frontiers, the fur|the&s;t that he hath South-Ea&s;twards, within Six Days Journey from hence, where they load their Goods in|to &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o bring them to <HI>Bagdet,</HI> which Journey, as &s;ome &s;ay, taketh them up Forty Days. Seeing that the Pa&s;&s;age both by Water and Land, be|longeth both to the King of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Sophi</HI> of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> (which al&s;o have their Towns and Forts on their Confines) which might ea&s;ily be &s;topt up by them, yet that notwith&s;tanding all this they may keep good Cor|re&s;pondence with one another, they keep Pigeons (chiefly at <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI>) which in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity might &s;oon be &s;ent back again with Letters to <HI>Bagdet.</HI> When loaden Ships arrive at <HI>Bagdet,</HI> the Merchants (chiefly tho&s;e that bring Spice, to carry through the De&s;arts into <HI>Turky</HI>) have their peculiar places in the open Fields without the Town <HI>Cre&s;iphon,</HI> where each of them fix|eth his Tents, to put his Spices underneath in Sacks, to
<PB N="184" REF="108">
keep them there &s;afe, until they have a mind to break up in whole Caravans; &s;o that at a di&s;tance, one would rather believe that Soldiers were lodged in them, than Merchants; and rather look for Arms than Merchants Goods: And &s;o I thought my &s;elf, before I came &s;o near that I could &s;mell them.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Merchants that came with the &s;ame Ships, came directly to our <HI>Camp,</HI> and among the re&s;t a Jeweller, which brought with him &s;everal precious Stones, <HI>viz. Diamonds, Chalcedonies,</HI> which make in|comparable Hafts to Daggers, <HI>Rubies, Topazes, Sap|phirs,</HI> &amp;c. the two fir&s;t whereof he had procured in <HI>Camboya,</HI> and mo&s;t of the re&s;t in the I&s;land of <HI>Zeylan,</HI> whereof he &s;hew'd us &s;everal very fine ones. The Merchants bring the&s;e along with them in great Ca|ravans, and keep them very clo&s;e and private, that they may not be found out at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es and be taken away from them, which the <HI>Ba&s;haws,</HI> do con|&s;tantly endeavour with all their Might and Power. For the <HI>Turks</HI> do not love that Precious Stones &s;hould co&s;t them Money, for they are extraordinarily covetous, wherefore you find but a few among them, but if they can have them without co&s;t, after the afore&s;aid man|ner they love them dearly; and keep them in great E&s;teem. In the room of them other Stones are &s;ent into the <HI>Indies</HI> again, Corals, Emralds (which are bought be&s;t in <HI>Aegypt</HI>) Saffron, Chermes-berries, and &s;everal Sorts of Fruit, as Cibebs, Dates, (which are there &s;o pliable and Soft that you may pack them to|gether in great lumps as they do Tamarinds) Figs, Almonds and many others which I cannot now remem|ber, and al&s;o &s;everal Sorts of Silks; and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hand|kerchiefs: But above all, fine Hor&s;es, whereof they &s;end Abundance into the <HI>Indies</HI> by the way of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but more by the way of <HI>Ormutz,</HI> wherefore the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> received yearly a good Sum of Money for Cu&s;tom, <HI>viz.</HI> Forty Ducats for each, which the Merchants pay very freely, becau&s;e that tho&s;e that im|port Hor&s;es (as I am informed) pay but half Duty for their other Goods at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es, and &s;ell them be&s;ides with good Profit. Some of the&s;e Hor&s;es
<PB N="185" REF="108">
are al&s;o &s;ent (becau&s;e of their Beauty and Goodne&s;s) into <HI>Syria, Natolia,</HI> and to us into <HI>Europe,</HI> where they are &s;old or pre&s;ented to Princes, and other great Per&s;ons of Quality. They feed there Hor&s;es in the&s;e Countries chiefly with Barly and Straw, &s;o as it is broke by their Thre&s;hing-Waggons, which they hang about their Heads in Sacks, as they do al&s;o about A&s;&s;es, rather than give it them in Man|gers, as we do. For want of Straw they &s;ometimes litter them with a fine loo&s;e Earth, which they after|ward throw by in heaps to make it clean again to &s;erve another time. When among other Merchants, Chri&s;tians arrive from our Countries at <HI>Ormutz,</HI> which happeneth very &s;eldom, all tho&s;e of them that have been any ways afflicted by <HI>Turks, Arabians,</HI> or <HI>Jews,</HI> mu&s;t appear, before &s;ome certain Officers of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> appointed for that purpo&s;e, and make their Complaints to them, of what hath happened to them, or what Damage they have &s;uffered or received; and in Ca&s;e they &s;hould omit any thing, they are them|&s;elves &s;everely puni&s;hed. If then it appeareth, that one of them hath been cheated of his Money, imme|diately &s;ome Merchants of the &s;ame Nation although innocent, and knowing nothing of it, are flung into Pri&s;on, where they mu&s;t remain until they have made Satisfaction to the utmo&s;t Farthing, and are be&s;ides &s;e|verely puni&s;hed, for an Example to others that they may take warning. But if a Chri&s;tian &s;hould be mur|thered, and they come to know of it, then Three or Four of them, more or le&s;s, according to the Manner of the Fact, mu&s;t &s;uffer and lo&s;e their Lives for every Chri&s;tian. From thence it cometh, when Merchants of many Nations are going into a Ship in order to go to the <HI>Indies</HI> by the Way of <HI>Ormutz</HI> (where they mu&s;t land upon Penalty of Confi&s;cation of all their Goods) that, when fir&s;t they put off, they look &s;trange|ly upon one another, and take great notice of, or mind one another much, and &s;ay very little or nothing, not making them&s;elves known, fearing that &s;omething may be had again&s;t them; and this endureth &s;o long, untill they are gone half the way, then they begin to be
<PB N="186" REF="109">
acquainted. Further I under&s;tood, that the King of <HI>Por|tugal</HI>'s Governour in the <HI>Indies</HI> hath already (to make him&s;elf &s;trong and the more able for a War) made &s;e|veral of the chiefe&s;t and powerfulle&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> Knights or Noblemen, to the Number of 5000; and hath &s;ent many Je&s;uits to reform the&s;e Countries, to propagate their Religion and to in&s;titute there the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inqui|&s;ition. The <HI>Indians</HI> are lank in Body, brown in their Colour, well &s;haped, and of a very good Under&s;tand|ing: Wherefore Per&s;ons of Quality, and Merchants love to buy them, and chu&s;e them for their Servants, being in their Bu&s;ine&s;s very faithful, diligent and care|ful, as I have known many of them. The&s;e and many more Nations, as <HI>Turks, Moors, Armenians, Curters, Medians,</HI> &amp;c. which every one of them have their peculiar Language, are at <HI>Bagdet</HI> in great Numbers, but chiefly the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>; &s;o when I was there, there ar|rived a Caravan of Three Hundred, with Camels and Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with an Intention to go to <HI>Mecha,</HI> to give <HI>Mahomet</HI> a Vi&s;it, which they think, after <HI>Hali</HI> and <HI>Omar</HI> (who were his Companions and did live in that City) to be a very great Man. The&s;e <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have a peculiar Language, &s;o much differing, That neither <HI>Turks</HI> nor <HI>Arabians,</HI> nor other Oriental Nations can under&s;tand them, and &s;o they are forced to make them under&s;tand their meaning by Signs or an Interpre|ter, as well as I and other Strangers. They al&s;o have their peculiar Characters. They &s;it well on Hor&s;e-back, and have on long and wide Drawers, which &s;erve them al&s;o for Boots, and are very well furni&s;hed with Scy|meters, Bows and Darts: in&s;tead of Spurs, they have, as it is the Fa&s;hion in tho&s;e Parts, pointed Irons which are about an Inch and a half long, and are &s;owed to the hind part of their Shooes. They are al&s;o called <HI>Red Turks,</HI> which I believe is, becau&s;e they have behind on their Turbants, Red Marks, as Cotton-Ribbands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Red Brims, whereby they are &s;ooner di&s;cerned from other Nations. They may al&s;o be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by their grey woollen Coats, which have commonly Three Plaits behind, and come hardly down to their Knees. They are a &s;trong and valiant People, of a
<PB N="187" REF="109">
noble Countenance, and Mind, very Civil, and in their Dealings upright. They are very wary in their Under|takings, which you may &s;ee by this, that before they conclude a Bargain, they take up more time to con|&s;ider than others to two or three, which I have &s;everal times ob&s;erved. Among other Merchandices they have delicate Tape&s;try of &s;everal colours, and &s;everal &s;orts of Cotton-Work, in which they are great Arti&s;ts, and well skilled, but as for others, as Gold and Silver working, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they under&s;tand little, and a great deal le&s;s of Gilding, wherefore they take any thing that is glo&s;&s;y for Gold. They love the Chri&s;tians that are Arti&s;ts and Ingenious in the&s;e &s;orts of Works, and &s;hew them all Civilities. But as for the <HI>Turks,</HI> becau&s;e great and bloody Wars ari&s;e often between them, they hate them very much, and call them Hereticks; 1. Becau&s;e they will not e&s;teem nor receive <HI>Hali</HI> and <HI>Omar</HI> (which they denominate <HI>Caliphi</HI>) as the greate&s;t and highe&s;t Prophets or Legates of God, that have, after <HI>Mahomet,</HI> given more certain and better Laws. Wherefore they e&s;teem them a great deal higher; nay, wor&s;hip them like Gods. 2. Becau&s;e that they as circumci&s;ed Men, e&s;teem their Women to be unclean, and reckon them to be Members that are not to be &s;aved, and therefore exclude them out of their Churches, &s;o that they may not appear there publickly, which by the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> ac|cording to their Laws and Ordinances, after they have &s;poke &s;ome Words after them, are received as ble&s;&s;ed Ones, and admitted to come to their Churches. From whence ari&s;e between the&s;e two Nations great Quarrels and Differences &s;ometimes, but yet they do not fall upon one another, nor make Incur&s;ions in time of Peace, &s;o violently on the Frontiers, as they do in <HI>Hungary</HI>; probably that one may (becau&s;e Negotiation goeth further into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and bringeth in great Cu&s;tom to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>) trade the &s;afer into the&s;e Parts. It is cheap and very good travelling through the&s;e Countries into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Cu&s;toms and Duties are very ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Further I under&s;tood from others, that here and there in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> live &s;everal Chri&s;tians, and that mo&s;t of them are
<PB N="188" REF="110">
of the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Pre&s;ter-John,</HI> whom they call <HI>Amma</HI>; and which way they are brought to it, I am thus informed, That formerly about Twelve Years a|gone, it did happen that the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> made a League with <HI>Pre&s;ter-John</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> which came then very hard upon him, and gave him his hands &s;o full, that he was forced to &s;eek for help by Strangers. Now when <HI>Pre&s;ter-John</HI> thought it very inconvenient for him to make a League with a King that was not of his Religion, he &s;ent him a Me&s;&s;age again, that he could make no League with him, except the chiefe&s;t of the Articles were, that he and his Subjects would receive his Religion, then he would not only do him all Friend&s;hip that in him lay, but al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his Might and Power, which at length was agreed up|on. Whereupon he did &s;end him one of his Patriarchs and &s;ome of his Prie&s;ts, which in proce&s;s of time had this Effect, that now even at this Day, there are a|bove twenty Towns in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where the mo&s;t of the Inhabitants are addicted to the Religion of <HI>Pre&s;ter-John.</HI> They have al&s;o as I was told, &s;everal Books of the Holy Scripture, and chiefly among the re&s;t, &s;ome of the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which they call <HI>Aerti&s;ch.</HI> And be&s;ides that, their Patriarch hath brought it to that pa&s;s, that they are no more &s;o zealous in their Super&s;titions; and are of Opinion that Circumci&s;ion is not nece&s;&s;ary, and that &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e their Enemies the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> have it. And, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on they do not abhorr the forbidden Bea&s;ts, but eat Pork, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor refu&s;e to drink Wine, and that as be|fore &s;aid, becau&s;e their Adver&s;aries are forbid it by their Law. So that the Chri&s;tian Faith doth in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> en|crea&s;e daily more and more, and they begin to be Chri&s;tened with Fire, according to their Fa&s;hion, and in the Name of God the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, whom they notwith&s;tanding (according to their Opi|nion) rather believe to be a Creature, than the Third Per&s;on of the Trinity, and that he doth only proceed from the Father and not from the Son. But that tho&s;e that are Chri&s;tians may be di&s;cerned, they wear a blue Cro&s;s on the in&s;ide of their left Leg a little above the
<PB N="189" REF="110">
Knee. They al&s;o admini&s;ter the Sacrament of the Holy Supper or Communion, and give it as well to the Young as to the Old ones in both kinds; but before they go to it, they mu&s;t have their Feet wa&s;hed, where|fore there are little Rivolets led through the Churches, where they &s;it down, and &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t of the Town come to them and wa&s;h their Feet, and when that is done they give unto one another a Ki&s;s of Love; then they read the Words of Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, and &s;o go to receive it; they do not come to Confe&s;&s;ion before: And they endure no Images in their Chur|ches, but in&s;tead of them they make u&s;e of Harps, Pipes and other In&s;truments, wherewith they make Mu&s;ick, but chiefly at the King's Court, at <HI>Samarcand</HI> (where his be&s;t Mu&s;icians are) which Town, as they &s;ay, was built by <HI>Sem</HI> the Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> and called after his Name. What el&s;e is to be &s;aid concerning the Points of their Religion, &s;hall be hereafter mentioned in the Chapter of the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ines.</HI></P>
<P>Further I was informed at my return, that after the Decea&s;e of <HI>Gamach</HI> the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that had three Sons and one Daughter (who was &s;oon married to one of the chiefe&s;t of the Council at Court) whereof the Elde&s;t called <HI>Al&s;chi</HI> was beheaded, becau&s;e he did endeavour to take away his Father's Crown, the other two are &s;till in being; the younge&s;t of them <HI>Baltha&s;ar</HI> liveth in <HI>Par&s;id,</HI> a peculiar Province and Town in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which lieth on the Borders of the <HI>Indies</HI>; and the middlemo&s;t, called <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> was lately after his Father's Decea&s;e, elected King, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, when the now reigning <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour <HI>Amura|thes</HI> came to the Crown. This is &s;till young, and of a tall and &s;lim Body, but very manly, and full of Cou|rage, and well skill'd in all Warlike Exerci&s;es, &s;o that he dare before any of his Courtiers ride wild and unbroken Hor&s;es (by them called <HI>Aecaik</HI>) which are not ea&s;i|ly ma&s;tered. They are brought to him a great way off out of the Ea&s;tern Parts; they are as I am informed of an A&s;hen colour, only &s;ome have white Legs; in the&s;e and other Exerci&s;es he hath &s;hown his Manline&s;s from his Infancy. But when he did encrea&s;e in Age
<PB N="190" REF="111">
and in Strength, the Anger and Di&s;plea&s;ure he bore a|gain&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> did increa&s;e al&s;o, and to that Degree that he re&s;olved, during his Father's Life, to be re|veng'd of them, for the wrong they had done to his Ance&s;tors. Wherefore, a little while agone he brought together a great many Men in the frontier Places, to &s;urprize the Town of <HI>Bagdet</HI> unawares, being one of the Chiefe&s;t, that formerly had belonged to his Ance&s;tors, together with the whole Country, wherein the new Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> when they fir&s;t come to the Government are u&s;ed to be crowned. When he was thus prepared for the On&s;et, and nothing was wanting, &s;ome Tray|tors ran away from his Troops and acquainted the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> of <HI>Bagdet</HI> with his De&s;ign, &s;o the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> was forced to arm him&s;elf with all Speed as well as he could, that he might be able to oppo&s;e him in his De|&s;igns. But when the King's Son would have put his Intention into Execution, the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> fell upon him unawares with &s;uch a Number and Strength, that he could not only attempt nothing but was beaten, and he him&s;elf taken Pri&s;oner. Be&s;ides this the Grand <HI>Turk</HI> would have had him to be beheaded, if his Father had not with great earne&s;tne&s;s taken his part, and given him for his Ran&s;om the Town <HI>Orbs</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opotamia.</HI> Af|ter this the old King had enough to do, to keep his Son in &s;afe Cu&s;tody, that he might not begin new Alarms and Wars again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Before I began my Voyage in <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 74; certain News came to <HI>Aleppo</HI> that 25000 <HI>Turks</HI> were killed on the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI>; but in what Place this Battel was fought, and which way it was done, I could not learn (for if they &s;uffer any Damage they always keep it very clo&s;e and &s;ecret) nor any ways hear: Wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> at that time were a great deal harder towards the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o that many &s;uffered for their Misfortunes Sake: But if they had obtained the Victory (as well as not) they would not have been &s;o &s;ilent, but would have &s;pread it a|broad, and have related it to others, that did not ask them, with high and big Words. So great an Opinion have the <HI>Turks</HI> of them&s;elves, that they really believe,
<PB N="191" REF="111">
there is no other Nation, that can conquer the World &s;o as they, although they are not to be compared with the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> neither for Strength, Manline&s;s, nor Shape; &s;o therefore they could effect but very little again&s;t others, if it were not for their great Number, where|with they over-power them. And to &s;peak only of the Inhabitants of this Town, there are &s;o many &s;ick and lame People in it, that you would admire to &s;ee &s;o many lame and limping ones in the Streets; yet the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> cannot hold out the War at length, nor keep a War at a great Di&s;tance, for his Revenue is not &s;o great as to make &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion for his Offi|cers and Souldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pay them as well in time of Peace as of War: For his Subjects are freed from all Taxes and Impo&s;itions, according to their ancient Pri|vileges and Cu&s;toms. They never arm them&s;elves for a Defence, but when they are called together by their King, to defend and protect their Country, Hou&s;e or Land, Wife and Children, again&s;t the A&s;&s;ault of an Enemy.</P>
<P>When I was thus enquiring from one or other, and en|deavouring to inform my &s;elf and learn whether it were more commodious for us two, to go by Water to <HI>Or|mutz,</HI> or by Land through <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and we thought of nothing el&s;e but to begin our Voyage daily to go further; I was call'd on a &s;udden by a Let|ter to come away for <HI>Aleppo</HI> immediately, which trou|bled me very much, and that the more when I con&s;i|dered, that I was pa&s;&s;ed the Wilderne&s;s and come into the fruitful Ea&s;tern Countries, which would have been very well worth &s;eeing. So after I had con&s;idered a while, I agreed with my Comerade, that he &s;hould go on with the Voyage in hand, and that I (becau&s;e be&s;ides the Letter, I had others no &s;maller Hinde|rances) would go back again. So I fitted him out for his Voyage with all Nece&s;&s;aries, &s;o that two Days after he went with other Merchants into the Ship for <HI>Bal|&s;ara.</HI> Not long after I had of him, a very mournful Me&s;&s;age or Account that the Ship (wherein he went from <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> to <HI>Ormutz</HI>) was peri&s;hed in a great Storm, near the I&s;land <HI>Baccharis</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Sea (where
<PB N="192" REF="112">
they find good &s;tore of Oriental Pearls) and that he and &s;everal other Merchants, and rich Merchants Sons from <HI>Aleppo</HI> were drowned. At the &s;ame time I might have returned back again with a great Caravan to <HI>A|leppo,</HI> but becau&s;e they took the &s;traighte&s;t way through great and &s;andy De&s;arts, which la&s;ted for Fifty Days Journeys or thereabout, where we had but two pla|ces to pay Cu&s;tom in, where we could buy Provi&s;ion, as Water and other Nece&s;&s;aries, I re&s;olved within my &s;elf to go by more Fruitful Places, and Famous Towns (although I went about) where I might &s;ee and learn &s;omething more; &s;o I did &s;tay in the great <HI>Camp</HI> longer until I met with &s;ome Companions. In the mean time, while I &s;tayed there, I made my &s;elf ac|quainted with an eminent Merchant, that lived in <HI>A|leppo,</HI> and had been &s;everal times in the <HI>Indies</HI>; who told me, that the Je&s;uits had begun to &s;et up a very &s;evere Inqui&s;ition in the <HI>Indies,</HI> chiefly in <HI>God,</HI> where they ob&s;erved diligently, tho&s;e that did not take of their Hats to the Images (which were &s;et up in &s;eve|ral Streets of the Town) that they might put them into Pri&s;on, which he did very much di&s;like, believing it to be very great Idolatry.</P>
<P>After he had &s;aid this, he began to talk further to me concerning Religion, and chiefly of the Articles of our Chri&s;tian Faith; and made me immediately (when he began to be &s;en&s;ible that I was of the &s;ame) &s;o fine a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Chri&s;tian Faith, &s;o plainly and with &s;uch Grounds of Scripture, that I was a&s;toni&s;hed, for I could never have believed, I could have met with the Fellow of him in the&s;e Countries. So he began to have a great Love for me, and de&s;ired me to go along with him, and to &s;tay with him in his Hou&s;e, until I had an Opportunity to go further, or that I might make him a Companion in his Voyage into the <HI>Indies,</HI> that during tho&s;e Travels, he would &s;hew me all Kind|ne&s;&s;es he could; nay, be as careful of me, as if I were his own Son. And after he under&s;tood that I was a Phy&s;ician, he proferred of his own accord to recom|mend me to the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> who was then &s;ick, and his very good Friend, to be his Phy&s;ician. But I having
<PB N="193" REF="112">
under&s;tood before, that others that had done the &s;ame, had been but very ill rewarded for their Pains and Care they had taken, and chiefly by tho&s;e they did Cure; I would not undertake it, fearing I &s;hould have the &s;ame mea&s;ure, and in&s;tead of a Reward have my Li|berty taken away from me, wherefore I thanked him for his Kindne&s;s. Had it not been for this, I &s;hould have accepted of it, notwith&s;tanding that they have no Apothecaries Shops that are any thing provided, but I mu&s;t have bought the Ingredients from one Shop|keeper or other, and &s;o collected them from &s;everal places, for I could hardly find any thing by them, &s;a|ving &s;ome &s;trange &s;ort of Turpentine Nuts, whereof they have abundance, and they are as good, as <HI>Pi&s;tachia</HI>'s, wherefore the Inhabitants keep them by them, and eat them as we eat &s;mall Nuts in our Country. I have eaten &s;everal of them, and found them of a &s;alti&s;h ta&s;te and of a drying quality. The&s;e are called by the <HI>Ara|bians, Botn,</HI> and by the <HI>Per&s;ians, Terbaick.</HI> I have chiefly &s;een two kinds of them, the greater and the le&s;s, and &s;o the <HI>Arabians</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h them into <HI>Botn|quibir</HI> and <HI>Sougier.</HI> The bigger is in &s;hape pretty like unto the Pi&s;tach Nut, only it is a little rounder and &s;o &s;horter; the le&s;&s;er is with its hard &s;hell of the big|ne&s;s of a Pea, and are &s;haped like unto an Hart, or the <HI>Dora,</HI> that is, the <HI>Indian-Hart.</HI> A great many of them grow in <HI>Agemia, Per&s;ia, Me&s;opotamia</HI> and <HI>Arme|nia,</HI> &amp;c. and grow together in clu&s;ters like Grapes as the <HI>Pi&s;tachies</HI> do, or rather the Berries of our <HI>Turpen|tine-Trees,</HI> for which they ought to be taken; chiefly, becau&s;e the Trees wherein they grow, are in their long Leaves pretty like unto the <HI>Turpentine-Tree,</HI> whereby they are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Pi&s;tachia-Tree,</HI> which hath roundi&s;h ones. This being &s;o, I take the little one for the <HI>Bell,</HI> and the great one for the <HI>Fael</HI> of <HI>Serapio, Avicen</HI> and <HI>Rha&s;es,</HI> which (as Authors &s;ay) grow chiefly in the <HI>Indies:</HI> And this the rather, becau&s;e Authors attribute the &s;ame Virtue and Operation to them. So may according to this, chiefly the great Nuts <HI>Fael,</HI> be taken for the Fruit of the <HI>Indian Tur|pentine-Tree,</HI> whereof <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> in his Fourth Book
<PB N="194" REF="113">
and Chapter Five, maketh mention, all which would be too tedious to be related here at large. Be&s;ides the&s;e Nuts, the before-mentioned Authors (chiefly <HI>Serapio</HI> in his 251&s;t. Chapter) makes &s;till mention of another &s;ort of Fruit, called by him <HI>Sel,</HI> and by <HI>Avicen, Scel,</HI> which are not in hard &s;hells, but as I &s;aw them, quite bare, of the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Pi&s;tachia</HI>-Nut, and of the co|lour of the Kernel of our <HI>Wall-nut</HI>; they have a pret|ty bitteri&s;h ta&s;te, and &s;en&s;ibly Sharp. I did find none of them in the&s;e Parts by the Shop-keepers, but had it only after that in the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Minorites</HI> in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> of one of their Order, who told me al&s;o that they did grow in the&s;e Countries. Of Coloquints, or white gourd Apples, &s;till known to the People by the old Name <HI>Handhal,</HI> there grow &s;o many hereabout, that they &s;end them to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and from thence into our Countries; and al&s;o the delicate round <HI>Cyperus</HI> Root, by the Inhabitants called <HI>So&euml;dt,</HI> whereof one may find great quantities growing in mo&s;&s;y and wet Grounds. I did al&s;o find by the Shop-keepers, the white Seed of <HI>Machaleb,</HI> which are in hard &s;hells, which are long and pointed, and covered without with a tender skin, like unto the <HI>Pi&s;tachia</HI>-Nut. A great quantity of them are carried from thence into <HI>Syria,</HI> and u&s;ed to perfume Soap-Balls. The Trees whereon they grow I did not &s;ee, yet, as I am informed, they grow here|about, but chiefly on the Mountains that are by the way to <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> They are &s;till to this Day by the Inha|bitants, as by <HI>Serapio,</HI> called <HI>Nahandt.</HI> But although there are &s;everal &s;orts of them, yet they all boil them (after they have been &s;teep'd for &s;ome hours in Water, to get off the thin &s;hells, as we do with Almonds) in Milk or Wine into a Pap, and put Sugar or Honey to it, chiefly to the white ones to take away their bitter|ne&s;s. I found farther a &s;trange Gum in great pieces, &s;omewhat like unto Frankincen&s;e, or <HI>Ammoniacum,</HI> which the Inhabitants chew all Day long in&s;tead of <HI>Ma&s;tich,</HI> and they attribute the &s;ame Virtues to it. Wherefore great quantities thereof are brought thither (chiefly from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>) which they call <HI>Taxa,</HI> as I am informed from the Tree <HI>Tax,</HI> which are very like un|to
<PB N="195" REF="113">
<HI>Cypre&s;&s;es</HI> in &s;hew and bigne&s;s, only their Roots are not &s;o long, wherefore they are the ea&s;ier over-turned by the Wind. According to this, I remember of the Trees <HI>Thuja,</HI> whereof <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> maketh mention in <HI>Book</HI> V. <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. and of <HI>Thya</HI> of <HI>Pliny.</HI> I al&s;o &s;aw without the <HI>Batzers</HI> or Exchanges, very high and big <HI>Caper-Trees</HI>; and here and there in the Fields a pecu|liar &s;ort of Red-gra&s;s, like unto that of <HI>Babylon,</HI> ac|cording to the de&s;cription of <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> and hath &s;till retained his ancient <HI>Arabian</HI> Name <HI>Negil</HI> among the Inhabitants. This hath long fibrous and yellowi&s;h Roots, with many Joynts, and puts out by them year|ly &s;everal Buds, which grow into hard Leaves, which are long and pointed, and at each &s;ide very &s;harp and cutting, like unto them of the Red-gra&s;s; between them come out &s;mall Stalks or Holms, each whereof hath a peculiar Ear at the top coming out of its Gra&s;s-&s;heath, which is long, thin, and its Seeds grow in two rows, between &s;mall Leaves, like unto the wild <HI>Galen|gal.</HI> This doth not only grow hereabout, but al&s;o in &s;everal other Places and Provinces, where the Ground is &s;andy, as <HI>Su&s;iana, Per&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. in great quantity, and becau&s;e it is by rea&s;on of its &s;harpne&s;s and cutting, very pernicious to Bea&s;ts, as to Bullocks, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that they die of it, therefore they have or keep the fewer of them, but in&s;tead thereof they keep Buffles (which can feed upon it ea&s;ier than other Bea&s;ts) to eat this Gra&s;s, which maketh the Buffle very cheap in the&s;e Countries, for I have &s;een one buy three of them for eight Ducats (<HI>which is in our Money about</HI> 48 <HI>Shil|lings</HI>) that was bigger than an <HI>Hungarian</HI> Bullock. Thus much I had to relate of <HI>Bagdet,</HI> its Situation, Trade, and &s;trange Plants, &s;o much as I could find and &s;ee at that improper time.</P>
<P>Being that I expected daily Company to go with me to <HI>Aleppo</HI> again, by the way of &s;everal Towns, and not &s;traight through the &s;andy Wilderne&s;&s;es, a <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> that I got acquainted withal in the mean while did inform me, that the <HI>Sophi</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> had &s;e|veral Unicorns at <HI>Samarcand,</HI> which he kept there; and al&s;o in two I&s;lands <HI>Alc</HI> and <HI>Tylos,</HI> which lay from

<HI>Samarcand</HI> nine Days Journey, further towards the Ea&s;t, near <HI>Spaam,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Griffins</HI> (by them called <HI>Ale|ra</HI>) which were &s;ent him out of <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Pre&s;ter-John.</HI> They are a great deal bigger and higher, have a red coloured Head, a bearded Bill, and a Neck over-grown with Feathers, a thick Body, black Wings like unto an Eagle, and a long Tail like a Lion, and Feet like a Dragon, they are very eager for Fle&s;h; while they are yet young, the King taketh them along with him, and goeth often thither for Sport and Plea&s;ures &s;ake; but as they grow up and &s;trong, he hath them chain|ed about their Necks very &s;trongly. I did believe this the &s;ooner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">Too &s;oon, for that there are no &s;uch Creatures in the World as either <HI>Uni|corn</HI> or <HI>Griffin,</HI> I am as &s;ure as I can be of a Ne|gative.

But whether this be the noble Fruit <HI>Man|gas,</HI> (whereof <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI> maketh mention in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Indian</HI> Plants, which for Goodne&s;s &s;ake is carried over Sea into <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>) I leave to the learned to decide. But the <HI>Mu&s;a</HI> (which is as afore&s;aid, al&s;o common in <HI>Syria</HI>) beareth a great deal &s;maller Fruit, which is &s;mooth, yellowi&s;h, and bended, almo&s;t like unto Ci|truls in &s;hape. The&s;e are al&s;o of a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te, and therefore the plea&s;anter to eat; but are very unwhole|&s;ome, &s;o that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, was forced to for|bid his Souldiers to eat of them. The &s;ame <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="114">
did al&s;o inform me of the Poy&s;onous Fruit <HI>Per&s;ea,</HI> which is &s;till known to them by the Name of <HI>Sepha&punc;</HI> which they e&s;teem very little; and al&s;o the <HI>Peaches</HI> (called <HI>Het</HI>) which are not &s;o poy&s;onous (as &s;ome &s;ay) as the above-mentioned; for they e&s;teem the Kernels thereof to be good, whole&s;ome Phy&s;ick. But yet that they are not e&s;teemed by them, the chief Rea&s;on is, that they per&s;wade them&s;elves, that <HI>Nimrod</HI> (who was a great Magician or Necromancer) poy&s;oned them by his Black-Art, and that &s;ince that time, they could not be eaten; wherefore they have not been e&s;teemed ever &s;ince: This I thought convenient to mention, rather for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, that have a mind to tra|vel, that if one or more of them &s;hould go into the&s;e Countries, they might have occa&s;ion to make a more accurate enquiry after the&s;e things.</P>

Year, for <HI>Carcuch</HI> di&s;tant Six Days Journey, in the Confines of <HI>Media,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> which is &s;till called by them in their Language <HI>Hidekel.</HI> By the way we fir&s;t &s;aw &s;ome well-tilled Fields, and above us on the River <HI>Tigris</HI> &s;ome Villages, &s;o that I could not but think I &s;hould meet with a Country that had plenty of Corn, Mu&s;t and Honey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as it was commended by the the Arch-koob bearer of the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> and com|pared even with the Land of <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> but the further we went, the greater grew the Wilderne&s;&s;es, &s;o that we were forced to lodge all Night in the Fields.</P>
<P>The next Morning there appeared a great way off more little Villages belonging to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> But we went on through the De&s;arts (and my Fellow Travellers told me that they extend them&s;elves to <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Media</HI>) where we lo&s;t our way, and came in the Evening into a Bog which hindered us &s;o much, that I (becau&s;e their Sabbath began, whereon according to their Laws they mu&s;t not travel) was forced to &s;tay there, with them, all Night long in it, and al&s;o the next Day, in great Showers of Rain, not without great Inconveniency and Trouble. During our &s;taying there I look'd about me for &s;ome Plants; but found none becau&s;e they did but fir&s;t begin to &s;prout, but in the moi&s;t Places &s;ome wild <HI>Galengal</HI> with great round Roots by the Inhabitants called <HI>Soedt,</HI> and by both <HI>La|tines</HI> and <HI>Grecians, Cyperus.</HI></P>
<P>The 19th Day, after we were, not without trouble, got out of the Mire, our way extended its &s;elf &s;till further through de&s;olate Places and De&s;arts. I thought of <HI>Julian</HI> that impious <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, and of his Army, which when it went again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and was very numerous, over the River <HI>Tigris</HI> near to <HI>Cte&s;iphon,</HI> he was by an Ancient <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> that was a Pri|&s;oner, decoyed into the&s;e De&s;arts, where he was bea|ten and routed by the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> In this great Fight when the Emperour him&s;elf was mortally wounded, he took up (as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> &s;ay) a hand|full

of Blood and flung into the Air, yielded the Vi|ctory and &s;aid, Then <HI>Galilean</HI> (&s;o he called <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in whom he at fir&s;t believed, and afterwards denied and per&s;ecuted) thou ha&s;t beaten and conquered me. After we had lived for &s;everal Days very hardly in the De|&s;arts, and &s;pent our time in Mi&s;ery, we came on the 20th by <HI>Scherb</HI> a Village, over an A&s;cent, into ano|ther more fruitful and well tilled Country, &s;ituated on the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and for the mo&s;t part inha|bited by them, which we could conjecture by the com|mon Language. Now though travelling through the Confines, u&s;es commonly to be very dangerous, yet (I thank God) we met with none, &s;o that we without any Stop or Hinderance, reached that Night, the 21&s;t. of <HI>December,</HI> to <HI>Schilb,</HI> a curious Village, where we re&s;ted all Night and refre&s;hed our &s;elves.</P>
<P>From thence we went on through large and fruitful Valleys, but I found nothing (for it was but ju&s;t at the beginning of plowing time) that was worthy to be mentioned, for the Plants did but ju&s;t begin to &s;prout; we had by the way &s;everal Villages, and &s;o we had better opportunity to buy Provi&s;ion. The Three and Twentieth at Night we came to one where we could buy near one hundred Eggs for Two pence.</P>
<P>The next Day we got up early again, and &s;aw be|fore us the high Mountain <HI>Tauri</HI> all covered with Snow (which extendeth its &s;elf a great way from North and We&s;t to the Ea&s;tward) at a great Di&s;tance. We went on apace, and advanced to <HI>Tauk</HI> early in good time, and before their Sabbath began again. This Town is not very &s;trong and lieth on a Plain. We went into a <HI>Camp</HI> without it, and re&s;ted there all the Sabbath. After Sun-&s;et, when it began to grow dark, they de|&s;ired of me to light a Candle. I remembred then imme|diately, that they could not do it them&s;elves&punc; being for|bid by Law, as you may find in the 35th Chapter of <HI>Exodus,</HI> where you may &s;ee that they mu&s;t kindle no Fire in any of their Habitations, wherefore they fur|ni&s;h them&s;elves the Day before with all &s;orts of Pro|vi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries, that they may not need to do any Labour on the Sabbath, and yet may not want.

When the&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ay their Prayers, they u&s;e the &s;ame Ceremonies as the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> in the Ea|&s;tern Parts do: For fir&s;t they lift up their Hands, then they bow down forwards with their whole Body, and at la&s;t they kneel down and ki&s;s the Ground. The&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> bragg'd continually of their Patriarchs, and made mention of the Laws; but of the Ten Commandments they knew nothing, wherefore I took an Occa&s;ion to repeat them before them in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language (which is very much &s;poke in the <HI>Indies</HI>) as well as I could, and they did admire when they heard them, how I came to know them. But when I began to &s;peak of Chri&s;t and his Office, they bur&s;ted out into &s;uch Bla&s;|phemies, that I was glad to &s;ay no more, but hold my Tongue.</P>
<P>Not far off from <HI>Tauk,</HI> we &s;aw a very &s;trong Ca|&s;tle, near unto a Wood, that is guarded by a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on: This is &s;ituated in the Province of the <HI>Cur|ters,</HI> which beginneth there, and lieth between <HI>Me|dia</HI> and <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> all along the River <HI>Tigris</HI> and reacheth to <HI>Armenia.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Curters,</HI> which are almo&s;t all <HI>Ne&s;torians,</HI> &s;peak a peculiar Language, which was unknown to my Fellow Travellers, wherefore they could not &s;peak to them in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> nor <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language, which is &s;poke all along from <HI>Bagdet</HI> through <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> (in the Confines of two potent Monarchs) to that place. We were therefore forced to de&s;ire others that under&s;tood both Languages, to be our Interpre|ters through the Country of the <HI>Curters.</HI> But whe|ther this Language did run upon that of their Neigh|bours the <HI>Medians</HI> or no, I could not certainly learn; but yet I was informed that the <HI>Parthians, Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as peculiar Nations, had their peculiar Languages, as Hi&s;tories tell us, and we may al&s;o per|fectly &s;ee in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles the 2d Chapter and the 8th Ver&s;e, where it is thus written: <HI>And how hear we every Man in our own Tongue, wherein we were born?

<P>After the Sabbath of the <HI>Jews,</HI> my Companions, was over, we went on again, and came the 26th. of <HI>De|cember</HI> to <HI>Carcuck,</HI> a glorious fine City lying in a Plain, in a very fertile Country; at four Miles di&s;tance, is ano|ther that lieth on an a&s;cent, whither we al&s;o travel|led, my Companions having Bu&s;ine&s;s in both of them, and &s;o we &s;pent two Days in them, before we were ready to go on again.</P>
<P>The 29th. we travelled through large and dry Heaths, and came at Night to &s;ome Tents, which were made of Hair or Hair-cloth, wrought out of Goats and A&s;&s;es Hair, and fixed in &s;uch an Order, that they made Streets and Allies like unto a Market-Town. In one of the&s;e we went to lodge with the&s;e poor People (that are white <HI>Moors,</HI> and like unto the <HI>Gyp&s;uns</HI> in their &s;hape and figure) and to &s;tay there all night long. But whether the&s;e People are &s;ubject to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, or to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or any other, I could not find out by their Cloths, becau&s;e they all wear the &s;ame hereabout, nor could I di&s;cern any thing by their Language. To us came a little after &s;ome more Travellers, &s;o that we had hardly room to lie down in. The&s;e People were very diligent and bu&s;y to get us &s;ome Meat and Drink, for the Husband went &s;oon out of Doors to gather dry Boughs and Stalks of Herbs (which I could not at that time di&s;cern what they were) and brought them to us to boil or dre&s;s &s;ome Meat with them. The Woman was not idle neither, but brought us Milk and Eggs to eat, &s;o that we wanted for nothing; &s;he made al&s;o &s;ome Dough for Cakes (which were about a Finger
<PB N="202" REF="117">
thick, and about the bigne&s;s of a Trencher, as is u&s;ual to do in the Wilderne&s;&s;es, and &s;ometimes in Towns al&s;o) &s;he laid them on hot Stones, and kept them a turning, and at length &s;he flung the A&s;hes and Embers over them, and &s;o baked them thoroughly. They were very good to eat, and very &s;avory. This way of baking Cakes is not new, but hath been very u&s;ual among the ancients, &s;o we find in Scripture mention made of Bread baked a|mong the A&s;hes; the <HI>Romans</HI> called it, <HI>Panes Subcineri|tios</HI>; and &s;o we read in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> the 18th. Chapter, of Cakes made upon the Hearth, which <HI>Sarah</HI> made in ha&s;te when the three Men came to &s;ee <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>The 30th. we went from thence, and about Noon we came to a Town called <HI>Pre&s;ta,</HI> which is chiefly to|wards the River whereon it lieth, very well fortified, but what the Inhabitants call that River, I do not re|member, but according to its Situation it mu&s;t be that which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calleth <HI>Gorgus,</HI> which runs below into the <HI>Tiger.</HI> In this place they make Floats, which al|though they are not very big, nor have much Wood in them, yet they have abundance of Bucks and Goats Skins blown up, hung or fixt underneath the bottom, without doubt, by rea&s;on that they may load the more upon them, and al&s;o becau&s;e the River is rapid, that they may have the le&s;s fear or danger. On the&s;e Floats they carry &s;everal &s;orts of Merchandices, but chiefly Fruit, <HI>viz.</HI> Figs, Almonds, Cibebs, Nuts, Corn, Wine, Soap, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a great part whereof goeth further into the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Day of <HI>December</HI> we travelled on, and came through well tilled Fields about Night into the Town <HI>Harpel,</HI> which is pretty large, but very pitifully built, and mi&s;erably &s;urrounded with Walls, &s;o that it might ea&s;ily be taken without any great Strength or Lo&s;s; there we re&s;ted again the next Day being the Sabbath (and on the &s;ame Day fell <HI>New-Years-Day.</HI>) In the mean time I under&s;tood that the <HI>Turki&s;h Sangiack</HI> did a few Days ago condemn and put to execution eight great Malefactors, which made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to Rob and to commit Murder up and down on the High-way, (for there are a great many of the&s;e Rogues in this Province)
<PB N="203" REF="117">
chiefly on the borders of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which are very Moun|tainous, which maketh travelling very dangerous. The Relations and Friends of the&s;e Murderers and Robbers did take this very ill, that the <HI>Sangiack</HI> &s;hould execute them, and were re&s;olved to be revenged of him one way or other. In order thereunto they combined and agreed all together, and had every thing ready, and only &s;taid for the word to fall upon him, which would have been done accordingly, if he had not had good In|telligence of this their Intention, wherefore he went away <HI>incognito</HI> for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to complain to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour of this their unju&s;t Proceedings, and what they mu&s;t expect for this, they will know in a &s;hort time. This <HI>Sangiack,</HI> when he found nece&s;&s;ity of making his e&s;cape, and found that he wanted Mo|ney (which is very &s;eldom) he took up from an <HI>Arme|nian</HI> Merchant (that was very rich, and was arrived there to buy &s;everal Merchandices, chiefly Gauls, where|of grow many in the&s;e Parts) 300 Duckets, which put the Merchant into great danger: for when the&s;e rebelli|ous People came to under&s;tand it, they took it very ill of him, and threatned him very much, &s;o that he was forced to &s;tay &s;ome Days longer for more Com|pany, that &s;o he might go the &s;afer.</P>
<P>After we had joined him, we went from thence on the 5th. of <HI>January</HI> in a very hand&s;ome Number, for the Merchant alone had about Fifty Camels and A&s;&s;es, which were only loaden with Gauls, with him, to carry to <HI>Carahemit</HI> (where he lived) and to &s;end from thence to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where they are bought by our Merchants, to be &s;ent into our Country. So we travelled all Day long and al&s;o half the Night, without eating or drinking, very fa&s;t, and began to re&s;t about Midnight. After we had for the remaining part of the Night hardly refre&s;h|ed our Bea&s;ts and our &s;elves with eating and drinking a little, we broke up again before Day-light, to go on in our way. When we were gone a good way through fruitful and plea&s;ant Vallies, we came betimes to ano|ther River by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> called <HI>Caprus,</HI> which although it is not very broad, yet it is very deep, &s;o that we had much to do to get through, which I found not
<PB N="204" REF="118">
without a great detriment to my Plants, which I car|ried on Hor&s;e-back before me.</P>
<P>Soon after Noon a great way off before us, appeared a great Market-Town, <HI>Carcu&s;chey,</HI> where we arrived by Night, and fixed our Camp without and pretty near to it. This is quite inhabited by <HI>Armenians,</HI> which we could pre&s;ently find by the alteration of the Lan|guage and their Habit. They received us very willingly, and let us want for nothing. After we had &s;taid with them till Night, and refre&s;hed our &s;elves and our Bea&s;ts, we broke up again immediately and travelled all Night, which was &s;o dark, that we heard &s;everal Caravans that met us, but we could not &s;ee them, much le&s;s know how &s;trong they were, or from whence they came. At break of Day we came to another much larger Ri|ver, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Kling</HI> (if I do not mi&s;|take) and by <HI>Ptolomy, Licus,</HI> which hindered us very much in our Day's Journey; for the River being very broad, at lea&s;t a long Mile, it was very hard to hit exactly the right Ford, and not without great Dan|ger, which the <HI>Curters</HI> knew very well, &s;o that we were al&s;o in great fear of them. But after &s;ome were found in our Company that had often forded that River formerly, we ventured it, went in, and got over (thanks be to God) very &s;afe, only one A&s;s which went over below us, where the Stream went &s;tronger, was drowned, &s;o that we arrived very early on the 7th. of <HI>January</HI> to the <HI>Tigris</HI> again, and went into the Fa|mous City <HI>Mo&s;&s;el,</HI> that lieth on this &s;ide of the River, over a Bridge made of Boats. This is &s;ituated in the Country of the <HI>Curters,</HI> and &s;o we were forced &s;till to keep our Interpreter. It belongeth to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Em|perour, as all the re&s;t hereabout. There are &s;ome very good Buildings and Streets in it, and it is pretty large; but very ill provided with Walls and Ditches, as I did ob&s;erve from the top of our Camp which extended to it. Be&s;ides this, I al&s;o &s;aw ju&s;t without the Town a little Hill, that was almo&s;t quite dug through, and in|habited by poor People, where I &s;aw them &s;everal times creep in and out as Pi&s;mires do in Ant-hills. In this place and thereabout, &s;tood formerly the Potent Town
<PB N="205" REF="118">
of <HI>Nineve</HI> (built by <HI>A&s;hur</HI>) which was the Metropolis of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> under the Monarch of the fir&s;t Monarchy, to the time of <HI>Sennacherib</HI> and his Sons, and was about three Days Journey in length. So we read that the Pro|phet <HI>Jonas,</HI> when at the Command of God, he preached Repentance to them, did go into it one Day's Journey, which the People did hearken willingly unto, and did amend their Lives, but they did not long remain peni|tent, but turned to their former Iniquity again, where|fore their De&s;truction and Ruine, was progno&s;ticated to them by the Prophets <HI>Nahum</HI> and <HI>Zephaniah,</HI> and al&s;o by the pious <HI>Tobias,</HI> that did live there again, which did al&s;o not long after follow. Yet was it re|built again afterwards, and did &s;uffer very much up|on changes of Governments, until at length <HI>Tamerlan</HI> came and took it by Storm, burnt it, and reduced it into A&s;hes to that degree, that afterwards in the &s;ame place grew Beans and <HI>Coloca&s;ia, &amp;c.</HI> So that at this time there is nothing of any Antiquities to be &s;een as in Old <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;ave only the Fort that lieth upon the Hill, and &s;ome few Villages, which as the Inhabitants &s;ay, did al&s;o belong to it in former Days. This Town lieth on the Confines of <HI>Armenia,</HI> in a large Plain, where they &s;ow the greate&s;t part of their Corn, on the other &s;ide of the River; for on this &s;ide in <HI>Me&s;opota|mia,</HI> it is &s;o &s;andy and dry, that you would think you were in the middle of the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia.</HI> Yet there is a very large Depo&s;ition of Merchandices, becau&s;e of the River, wherefore &s;everal Goods and Fruits, are brought thither from the adjacent Countries, both by Land and Water, to Ship them for <HI>Bagdet.</HI> Among the re&s;t I &s;aw abundance of &s;mall and great <HI>Turpen|tine</HI>-Nuts, by the Inhabitants called (as above-&s;aid) <HI>Bont-quiber</HI> and <HI>Sougier</HI>; and al&s;o another &s;ort of <HI>Man|na</HI> as big as a double Fi&s;t, which is very common here, and is brought from <HI>Armenia,</HI> as they told me. It is of a brown colour, a great deal bigger and firmer, and not &s;o &s;weet as that of <HI>Calabria,</HI> yet very good and plea&s;ant to eat. Within it are &s;everal red Grains, &s;o &s;mall that one taketh no notice of them when one eats it. It loo&s;eneth the Body very well, but not &s;o much
<PB N="206" REF="119">
as ours, wherefore the Inhabitants eat great pieces thereof in the Morning, as the Country-men on the Mountains of <HI>Algaw</HI> eat Chee&s;e. But whether the <HI>Arabians</HI> make mention thereof, if it be not the <HI>Man|na Alhagiezi,</HI> whereof <HI>Avicen</HI> in his Second Book the Second Treati&s;e, and the 758th. Chapter maketh men|tion, I know not neither what it is to be reputed. The Town <HI>Mo&s;&s;el</HI> is as above-&s;aid, for the greate&s;t part inhabited by <HI>Ne&s;torians,</HI> which pretend to be Chri|&s;tians, but in reality they are wor&s;e than any other Na|tions what&s;oever, for they do almo&s;t nothing el&s;e, but rob on the High-ways, and fall upon Travellers and kill them: Therefore being that the Roads chiefly to <HI>Zibin</HI> (to which we had Five Days Journey, and for the mo&s;t part through &s;andy Wilderne&s;&s;es) are very dangerous, we &s;taid &s;ome Days longer expecting more Company that we might go the &s;urer.</P>

<P>AFter our Journey had been deferred for four Days, we broke up on the 11th. of <HI>January</HI> &s;everal Hun|dred &s;trong, and went on for the whole Day with|out eating, with all &s;peed until the Sun &s;et at Night, when we encamped on an a&s;cent near a &s;mall Village, to keep our Bea&s;ts and Goods &s;afe, and to refre&s;h our &s;elves and them. We watched all Night long, and went continually three and three together, round about our Camp by turns.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="119">The next Day we proceeded on again in our Jour|ney with all &s;peed, rather for a good Fountain or Spring's &s;ake, (as they do in the&s;e Countries, in the va&s;t De&s;arts) than to reach a good Inn, where we ar|rived late at Night, and encamped near it, to &s;tay all Night to re&s;t. A little after when we were at Sup|per, &s;ome of the <HI>Curters</HI> came to us into our Camp, &s;poke to us kindly, and asked us whether we did want any thing that they could help us to, but we &s;oon perceived them to be Spies, that were &s;ent by their Companions, to &s;ee what Strength we were of. But when they perceived that we were not plea&s;ed with them, they did not &s;tay but went away, and we com|po&s;ed our &s;elves to re&s;t, but kept a good Guard as we had done the Night before. About Midnight when we were in our fir&s;t Sleep, our Watch-men perceived a great Number of the <HI>Curters</HI> to approach, wherefore they awaked us with a great &s;houting to alarm us the &s;oon|er, and to bring us into good Order, and to frighten our Enemies and to drive them away. But they did not only not mind us, but made all ha&s;te they could up to us, and that &s;o near, that we could &s;ee them, although it was dark, before our Camp, by their Heads. But when they found us in a good Order and Condition to oppo&s;e them, and did hear that our Gun|ners and Archers (which were ready to let fly at them) called with a loud Voice to them, <HI>tahal, tahal Harami,</HI> that is, Come hither, come hither you Thiefs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they halted for a little while, and were &s;o afraid of us, that they turned their Backs and run away. Afterwards when we feared nor expected their A&s;&s;aults any more, they came quickly again a &s;econd time, in a far great|er Number than before. They led before them one Camel, and &s;everal Hor&s;es (which in the dark we could only di&s;cern by their Heads looking again&s;t the Sky) in their Hands, without doubt, that we might look upon them to be Travellers, or el&s;e that we might not be able to di&s;cern their Number. But notwith&s;tanding all this their fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault was &s;till in fre&s;h Memory, wherefore we did not tarry, but drew &s;oon up in our former Order again (wherein I was the left-hand Man
<PB N="208" REF="120">
in the fir&s;t Rank again, with my Scymeter drawn, and had before armed my Brea&s;t with &s;everal &s;heets of Pa|per, that I had brought with me to dry my Plants in) expecting their a&s;&s;ault every Moment. But when they made a halt again, (fearing their Skin as much as we did ours) and did neither &s;hout nor move up to|wards us, one of ours provok'd them, and did &s;hoot at the Camel, and did hit it &s;o that it gave a Sign there|of, but the re&s;t forbore to fire. So they Staid a little while, and then went off a Second time.</P>
<P>So we kept awake all the Re&s;t of the Night, and kept a good Watch, and went on our Journey again early the next Morning about break of the Day; and came a|gain to wide and dry Heaths, where we &s;aw neither Men nor Bea&s;ts, and &s;o we went on till Noon, where we encamped in a large Place, which was &s;urround|ed with Walls and Ditches pretty well, ju&s;t like unto a Fortre&s;s, whereof there are &s;everal in the&s;e dan|gerous Places to be &s;een. When we &s;tayed there, two <HI>Curters</HI> came again to us into our Camp, and &s;poke to us, pretending that they came to demand the Toll that was due there, it being their Place: but our Mer|chants &s;oon perceived, that they were not in a right Cau&s;e, wherefore they would allow them nothing, which put the&s;e two into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, that they drew their Swords, and would have at us; but our Friends did not &s;tay idle neither, but took their &s;words away, and laid on with dry Blows at them, and &s;o flung them out of our Camp. After this Hubbub was over, we dined, and that the rather that we might not be too much weakned by our hard travelling, and &s;o be the le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t the&s;e Robbers, for want of Strength if they &s;hould fall upon us, which we were not wont to do before Night, chiefly in great De&s;arts, for there we u&s;ed to get up pre&s;ently after Mid night, and tra|vel all Day long with all Speed, without eating, which I had often experimented before; wherefore I u&s;ed to provide my &s;elf always with Bread, and when I had a mind to eat it, I did either &s;tay behind or go before: for no body eats openly by the way in the &s;ight of others, except he has a mind to run a Hazard, becau&s;e
<PB N="209" REF="120">
that mo&s;t of them are very hungry, and &s;o eager at it, that they will a&s;&s;ault one another for it, and take it away from their very Mouths. After we had refre&s;hed our &s;elves, and fed our Bea&s;ts (which u&s;eth to be done al&s;o but once aday) we broke up with our Caravan, and went on again. We quickly &s;aw &s;ome Mountains before us, where, when we approached them towards the Evening, there appeared &s;ometimes, on a high one that before the re&s;t lieth nearer to the Plain, &s;ome of them, &s;o that we might very well pre&s;ume, that there was more of them behind in <HI>Ambu&s;cado,</HI> which al&s;o proved very true: For no &s;ooner were we pa&s;s'd it, but before we went up the Hill, they came out from behind the Mountain, in great Troops on Hor&s;e-back, which immediately drew up into order in the Fields, in Two Squadrons, Three and Three in a Rank, to the Number of about 300, almo&s;t as many as we were. They exerci&s;ed their Hor&s;es (which were very lank) very &s;wiftly, turn'd &s;ometimes on one, and then on the other hand, and came at length to us within a Bows Shoot. They had mo&s;t of them Darts, which they plaid withal in their full Speed, &s;ometimes holding it down-wards as if they would run through a Deer, which was a plea&s;ant but very dangerous Sight to us. When they &s;hewed them&s;elves &s;o as if they would fall upon us in&s;tantly, we drew our Ca|ravan clo&s;e together, in order to re&s;i&s;t them. Where|fore we &s;tood &s;till, and tied our Bea&s;ts together and bound the Fore foot of each of them, that they could not &s;tir: behind them &s;tood our <HI>Mockeri,</HI> with their Bows and all tho&s;e that were not well provided with Arms, and Hor&s;es, either to &s;hoot at the Enemy, or el&s;e in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, if they &s;hould come too near us, to &s;ally out, and cut off their Hor&s;es with our Scy|meters. Near unto us our Hor&s;es were drawn up into a Troop, ready for their A&s;&s;ault, to venture their Suc|ce&s;s. After a whole Hour's delay we &s;ent at length two of our Company to them, and they &s;ent al&s;o Two of theirs to meet them to parley together: But which way they made up an Agreement I know not, but they prevailed &s;o much with them, that &s;oon after they left
<PB N="210" REF="121">
us, and rode away, and we went on in our Journey. After this we kept our Caravan (that is &s;o much to &s;ay as a great many People, with loaden Camels, A&s;&s;es, and Hor&s;es) in far better Order than we had done be|fore, and came that &s;ame Day a good Way, to a &s;mall Village, where we encamped and &s;tayed all Night. We found no Wood thereabout, wherefore we made &s;hift with Bread, in&s;tead of other Victuals, and were very glad we had it. In the mean time the Inhabi|tants came to us, to gather the Dung of our Bea&s;ts (as they do in &s;everal other Places, chiefly in the De|&s;arts of <HI>Arabia</HI>) to burn it in&s;tead of Wood, which they do after the following Manner.</P>
<P>They make in their Tents or Hou&s;es a Hole about a Foot and half deep, wherein they put their earthen Pip|kins or Pots, with the Meat in them clo&s;ed up, &s;o that they are in the half above the middle, Three Fourth Parts thereof they lay about with Stones, and the Fourth Part is left open, through which they fling in their dried Dung (and al&s;o &s;ometimes &s;mall Twigs and Straws, when they can have them) which burn im|mediately and give &s;o great a Heat, that the Pot groweth &s;o hot as if it &s;tood in the middle of a lighted Coal-heap, &s;o that they boil their Meat with a little Fire quicker than we do ours with a great one on our Hearths; &s;o that the&s;e poor People, mu&s;t make very hard Shift, and do &s;ometimes as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> did in the Siege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where they al&s;o in their greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity did boil their Meat with Dung of Men and Bea&s;ts, as you may read in the 4th Chapter of <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> This Night and &s;everal others before, we pa&s;&s;ed more with watching than with &s;leeping, &s;o that &s;ometimes we contemplated the Con&s;tellations of the Skies, which are very much ob&s;erved by the&s;e Nations, but chiefly by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> which lodge always in the open Air and have no Shelter, &s;o that by the Stars they know the Hour of the Night, and when it is time for them to break up. They care not for Beds, but rather have Cloaks or Tape&s;try wherein they wrap them&s;elves up and keep them&s;elves warm, &s;o that no Fro&s;t, nor Rain, nor Dew can hurt them.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="121">The next Morning we broke up (that we might not expo&s;e our &s;elves any further) only after Day|light, and travelled all Day long without any Mole&s;ta|tion or Hinderance a long way after &s;everal rough Mountains: and al&s;o the next Day through &s;andy De|&s;arts, which were deep and hindred our going on very much. When it began to be Night, our Bea&s;ts were almo&s;t ready to lie down under their Burthens in the Sand, which was very tire&s;ome to us, and that the rather, becau&s;e we &s;aw the Town <HI>Zibin</HI> far off be|fore us, at Four Miles di&s;tance, but at length we got out of this bad Road, into green Meadows, to very clear Springs, which run over in &s;everal Places to water them: So that we began to make more &s;peed, and came the &s;ame Night yet very late into the Town. It is a fine Place &s;ubject unto the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour, not very big, lying on A&s;cent, very well &s;urrounded and fortified with Walls and Ditches. It is full of Conduits or Springs, but chiefly in the great <HI>Camp,</HI> where we re&s;ted for five Days to &s;tay for more Com|pany. There live Abundance of <HI>Armenians</HI> in it, for it lieth in the Confines of the greater <HI>Armenia,</HI> and &s;o we were no more in &s;o great danger as we were in the Country of the <HI>Curters.</HI> During my &s;taying there, the abovementioned rich <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant, and al&s;o an eminent <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gentleman (which were very kind to me upon the Road) de&s;ired me &s;everal times (having heard from the <HI>Jews</HI> that I was a Phy&s;ician) that I would be plea&s;ed to go along with them to <HI>Ca|rahemit,</HI> which Town was Four Days di&s;tant at the other &s;ide of the <HI>Tigris</HI>) to cure &s;ome of their Relations that were not well, they proffered me good Entertain|ment, and to recommend me to the young <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> Son of <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;haw</HI> (which was al&s;o &s;ick at that time) and to bring me into good Bu&s;ine&s;s; which I would have done with all my Heart, and nothing could have plea&s;ed me better, than to have &s;erved the <HI>Armenian</HI> for his Kindne&s;s. Yet becau&s;e I was &s;ent for to come to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and could not but be as good as my Word, wherein I had al&s;o no &s;mall Intere&s;t, I was obliged to leave that Journey, and to &s;trive with all Speed and
<PB N="212" REF="122">
Diligence to get thither. Now as this <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> is among the re&s;t (except the <HI>Vi&s;ir-Ba&s;haws,</HI> whereof there are four or five, which are always at Court about the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Emperour, as being his Privy Council) the Chief|e&s;t in <HI>Turky,</HI> &s;o he hath larger and more fruitful Ter|ritories than he of <HI>Bagdet,</HI> or any other, to govern, viz. <HI>A&s;&s;yria, Me&s;opotamia,</HI> and a large part of the greater <HI>Armenia,</HI> and of the Province of the <HI>Curters, &amp;c.</HI> all which border upon the Dominions of the <HI>Sophi</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>After we had refre&s;hed our &s;elves during this time, very well, and other Companies had joined us, we broke up on the 20th. towards Night, and went away. By the way we &s;aw &s;everal plough'd Fields and Villa|ges, and we could &s;peak better with the People, for they under&s;tood the <HI>Armenian, Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Arabian</HI> Languages, which are generally u&s;ed in the&s;e Countries. So our Travels went on with great &s;peed, &s;o that we reached on the 21&s;t. late, the Town of <HI>Hochan,</HI> where the <HI>Jews</HI> re&s;ted and kept their Sabbath. Here we re|ceived the News that <HI>Solyman</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour was Decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The 23d. we got up early again, and went the next way to <HI>Orpha,</HI> another Town, to which we had Five Days Journey. From thence the nearer we came to the Mount <HI>Tauri</HI> (which &s;eparateth <HI>Armenia</HI> from <HI>Me|&s;opotamia,</HI> towards the South) the wor&s;e grew the Roads, which we found very &s;ufficiently the next Day, for when we came further into the Mountains, the ways were &s;o full of Stones that we were hindered very much. Going thus on, after it had &s;nowed a little (which I have never &s;een but twice in the&s;e Countries) it happened, that one of the <HI>Jew</HI>'s Hor&s;es which was empty was frightened at &s;omething, and flung it &s;elf over and over. The <HI>Jew</HI> hearing this noi&s;e, looked back, and &s;eeing me &s;tand by it, he grew angry with me, as if I had done it, and began to handle his Bow and Arrows to &s;hoot at me, when I found him in ear|ne&s;t, and remembred how I lo&s;t my Wine in the Ship, when we went down the River, I did not delay, but went to hinder him, took him by his Leg and flung
<PB N="213" REF="122">
him off his Hor&s;e, before he could take his aim at me; &s;o we fell a boxing one another &s;o long, until at length I tripped up his Heels. When the other two &s;aw that we &s;poiled thus the Figure of the Snow, and that I was too hard for him, and had given him &s;everal hard blows, they came immediately to &s;epa|rate us, and to make Peace again between us; I &s;ee|ing that they did not come to wrong me, and al&s;o con&s;idering that we were to Travel together &s;till fur|ther, took their Coun&s;el, and was friends with him again, and &s;o we went on in our way. At Night we came to another Village again, in a narrow Valley ly|ing at the bottom of a great a&s;cent, near which we found a great Stable wherein we went, this was quite cut into the Hill, and &s;o was that wherein we lodged the Night before, &s;o that you could &s;ee nothing of it, but only the entrance, for they are commonly &s;o in the&s;e hilly Countries under Ground, that the Caravans may &s;afely re&s;t there and defend them&s;elves from Cold in the Winter. This Stable (being 25 Paces long and 20 broad, and all through equally high) was cut out of a Rock. About midnight, when we were in our fir&s;t Sleep, one of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s <HI>Chiaus,</HI> or Chamber-Me&s;&s;engers, knocked at the door of the Stable, who was come back from <HI>Bagdet</HI> in Six Days to this place, to look about for &s;ome fre&s;h Hor&s;es (becau&s;e he had tired his own, and could not have others by the way, as in our Country where Po&s;ts are ordered.) So he went in, took away from one Mockeri or Carrier, three Pack-Hor&s;es, and two more from the <HI>Jew</HI> (that I had had Contention with before) for the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers of the Chamber have great Privileges, and in ca&s;e of nece&s;|&s;ity, where-ever they &s;ee Hor&s;es in City or Country, they may take them leaving theirs in the room thereof: They value one no more than another, except Mer|chants and Strangers, which they excu&s;e before others, to encourage Trade; tho&s;e that they come to, mu&s;t deli|ver up their Hor&s;es, without any reluctancy, except they have a mind to be &s;oundly bang'd (as one of our Friends was that did not open the Gates immediately) or el&s;e to fare wor&s;e. When this <HI>Chiaus</HI> believed he had got
<PB N="214" REF="123">
very good Hor&s;es, he &s;oon found his mi&s;take, for the <HI>Jew</HI>'s Hor&s;es had galled Backs, wherefore he let him have them again for a &s;mall recompence, which was a Child's Coat made of delicate <HI>Indian</HI> Stuff. When our Journey was thus &s;topt, chiefly becau&s;e of the Mockeri or Carrier, until he could procure him&s;elf other Hor&s;es in the room thereof, at lea&s;t for that Day, we ro&s;e the earlier the next Day, and traver&s;ed &s;eve|ral rough Mountains, and went through narrow Val|lies that Day, until at Night we came to a Village in|habited by <HI>Armenians.</HI> The&s;e are good-hearted Chri|&s;tians, which have great Compa&s;&s;ion on their Fellow-Chri&s;tians, and love to entertain and to be kind to Strangers, which I have very often experienced, but chiefly in this Village, where one of the <HI>Armenians</HI> took me and the <HI>Jews</HI> into his Hou&s;e, and would fain have kept us al&s;o the next Day. Being at lei&s;ure, I would fain have conferred and di&s;cour&s;ed with him con|cerning our Chri&s;tian Faith, and &s;o was he willing, but being that we could not under&s;tand one another, and the <HI>Jews</HI> were in this ca&s;e by no means proper Inter|preters, we were forced to have patience by &s;ilence, and to look at one another. About that time they kept Lent, which I could perceive by their &s;mall &s;ort of Diet (for they did eat nothing but leguminous Food and Bread and Water.) After he had &s;et before us &s;ome boiled Eggs at Night, and I being hungry fell on them, not imagining that they kept &s;uch &s;trictne&s;s and difference in their Diet, he admired that I did not refu&s;e to eat the Eggs, and asked me by one of the <HI>Jews,</HI> whether I did not know that it was not allow|ed to Chi&s;tians to eat Eggs and the like Victuals in Lent; at this I would fain have an&s;wered him (that it became Chri&s;tians to keep Lent rather with Soberne&s;s and Ab&s;tinency, than with Di&s;tinctions and Differen|ces of Foods.) But I not under&s;tanding the Language, only an&s;wered him briefly, that our Lent was not yet begun, nor would until three Weeks hence begin, which did content him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The 28th. we went on our Journey again, and came right among the high Mountains, which were very
<PB N="215" REF="123">
rough, and full of Bu&s;hes; we got out of them before Night, and lodged our &s;elves in the next Village, which lieth on an a&s;cent in the Plain, where we al&s;o &s;tayed the next Day being the Sabbath. By the way, when the <HI>Jews</HI> were in fear of having their Hor&s;es taken away, as was done &s;ome Days before, they often gave them to me to lead them, as if they were mine, hoping to carry them off the ea&s;ier, &s;o that although they were my Guides, yet I was their Safeguard.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;t the great and rough Mountains, and were come into a very fruitful Valley, which ex|tendeth it &s;elf for a &s;mall Day's Journey to <HI>Orpha,</HI> there appeared pre&s;ently on each &s;ide &s;everal Villages, and afterwards the Co&s;tly City again&s;t us with the Ca&s;tle &s;ituated on the Hill, very plea&s;antly. Into this we got on the 30th. at Night very early, and went to lodge in the large and very well built <HI>Camp,</HI> and &s;tayed there for four Days. This Town is very plea|&s;ant, pretty big and with Fortifications well provided. It was formerly together with the whole Country, be|longing to the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but now it is as well as the greate&s;t part of the Country, brought under the &s;ubjection of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour. <HI>Orpha</HI> is a Town of very good Trade; they deal in Tape&s;try of &s;everal &s;orts, &s;ome whereof are made there, and &s;ent out to us; there is al&s;o a great Depo&s;ition of Merchandices, which are brought thither from <HI>Aleppo, Dama&s;cus, Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and other places, to go to <HI>Carahemit,</HI> Five Days Journey di&s;tant from hence, and &s;o to be carried further into <HI>Media, Per&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>Indies,</HI> &amp;c. yet all the&s;e Goods are brought thither in Caravans by Land, becau&s;e there is no Navigable River belonging to it. Some &s;ay that this Town was anciently called <HI>Haran</HI> and <HI>Charras,</HI> from whence the Patriarch <HI>Abraham</HI> de|parted with his Wife <HI>Sarah,</HI> and his Brother's Son <HI>Lot,</HI> according to the Command of God, <HI>Gen.</HI> Chap. 12. and went forth to go into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which the Lord had promi&s;ed to give him, and there is a plentiful Well &s;till to this Day called <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Well, where the Servant of <HI>Abraham</HI> (whom he &s;ent into <HI>Me|&s;opotamia</HI> to the Town of <HI>Nahor,</HI> to fetch a Wife for
<PB N="216" REF="124">
his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> from his own Kindred) did fir&s;t &s;ee <HI>Re|becca,</HI> when &s;he gave him and his Camels &s;ome Wa|ter to drink out of this Well. And &s;o did afterwards the Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> when he fled from his Brother <HI>E&s;au,</HI> at this &s;ame Well, make him&s;elf known to <HI>Ra|chel</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Laban</HI> his Mother's Brother, when he removed the Stone from the head of the Well, and &s;o let her Sheep drink. The Water of this Fountain hath a more whiti&s;h troubledne&s;s than others. I have drunk of it &s;everal times out of the Conduit, that runs from thence into the middle of the great <HI>Camp,</HI> and it hath a peculiar Plea&s;antne&s;s and a plea&s;ant Sweet|ne&s;s in its ta&s;te. To the &s;ame did al&s;o come the Son of the Pious <HI>Tobias,</HI> conducted by the Angel <HI>Raphael,</HI> whom his Father &s;ent to <HI>Rages</HI> (now called <HI>Ede&s;&s;a</HI>) as is above-mentioned, to call in a Debt from <HI>Gabel,</HI> as you may read in the 11th. Chapter of his Book, when they returned by the way of <HI>Haran,</HI> which is half way to <HI>Nineve.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Jews</HI> had done their Bu&s;ine&s;s there with good Succe&s;s, we went on in our Travels again, and came again into the high and rough Mountains, where we &s;pent al&s;o the next Day with great trouble and hard&s;hip, until we came again to the great River <HI>Eu|phrates</HI> into the Town <HI>Bir,</HI> whereof I have made men|tion before. And although we had no more but two half Days Journey to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> yet the <HI>Jews</HI> my Fellow-travellers had Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Famous Town <HI>Ni&s;ib,</HI> (which is &s;ituated on this &s;ide the River on the bor|ders of the le&s;&s;er <HI>Armenia</HI>) &s;o that we were bound to go thither; &s;o we put out again on the 6th. of <HI>February</HI> after their Sabbath, and went through very fruitful and well cultivated Corn-Fields, to <HI>Andeb,</HI> towards Evening. It is a pretty big Town, but not very &s;trong. It lieth on two &s;mall Hills very plea&s;antly, &s;o that you may &s;ee it plainly and di&s;tinctly, as &s;oon as you come from out of the Valley by the Lake into the Fields. Yet notwith&s;tanding that it is &s;o plea&s;antly &s;ituated and looketh &s;o &s;tately at a di&s;tance, it is but pitifully built when you come within it. In former Ages this Town hath been &s;everal times be&s;ieged by the Kings of
<PB N="217" REF="124">
<HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by whom it was taken at la&s;t, and kept &s;o long, until the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour <HI>Galienus Odenatus Palmy|renus,</HI> took it from King <HI>Sapor,</HI> together with the Town <HI>Orpha,</HI> and laid it to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire again. But in the&s;e our Times, to our grief, it is brought a|gain, together with all the Country, under the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Slavery. The Inhabitants have very little Trade, they live for the mo&s;t part upon their E&s;tates, by cul|tivating their Grounds, and chiefly from the Fruits of Vineyards and Orchards, which are planted with Pomgranates and Figs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o thick, (that from the great quantity of Trees they may have the more Fruit) that you would at a di&s;tance, rather take them to be Woods of wild Trees, than of fruitful ones. So they &s;end Yearly many &s;orts of Fruits, but chiefly <HI>Cibebs</HI> into the Ea&s;tern Countries, by great Caravans, where|of I have met many. After we had &s;taid here, and I had lo&s;t a whole Day, for their Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ake, we broke up again directly for <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and having pa&s;&s;ed for &s;e|veral Miles through rough, bad, hilly ways, we came at length into a plain, delicate and fruitful Country, &s;o fruitful of Wine and Corn, that on all my Journey, I have &s;een none like unto it. This did almo&s;t extend it &s;elf to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where we arrived early, with the help of the Almighty God, in very good health, on the 10th. Day of <HI>February.</HI> At my arrival, becau&s;e my Comrade <HI>Hans &V;lrich Krafft,</HI> with the re&s;t, were not there then pre&s;ent, pre&s;ently &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Merchants (which I had cured of &s;everal Di&s;tempers before my departure) came to me, and carried me home with them, de&s;iring me to live with them untill my Bu&s;ine&s;s (which cau&s;ed me to come back) were done, wherein really they did me a very great Kindne&s;s. For I having very well torn my Cloaths (which never came from my Back in half a Years time) I had there an Opportunity to re&s;t my &s;elf and to procure my &s;elf &s;ome new ones. <HI>I thank the Almighty God, for his many Mercies and Favours be&s;towed on me, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he graciou&s;ly af|forded me in this Voyage, returning him Prai&s;e, Honour and Glory,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>AT my return to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where my Bu&s;ine&s;s obliged me to &s;tay a while, I came to under&s;tand, that du|ring my ab&s;ence, &s;everal <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>French-men,</HI> were in their Sickne&s;s but very &s;lightly &s;erved by the <HI>Jews</HI> their Phy&s;icians; wherefore I did not only &s;oon re|cover my former Acquaintance and Practice by them, but might have al&s;o &s;tept into great Bu&s;ine&s;s with the <HI>Turks,</HI> for I was pre&s;ently &s;o well known, that I had much to do to excu&s;e my &s;elf with Di&s;cretion to get off of them, that I might e&s;cape their Anger and Di&s;|plea&s;ure, which I mu&s;t have got, if I had &s;erved them never &s;o faithfully, which I knew &s;everal had before me found by experience. Wherefore at the in&s;tance of &s;e|veral good Friends, I only cured two great Per&s;ons, whereof one was a <HI>Georgian,</HI> and at that time <HI>Sangiack</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which were very well plea&s;ed with me, and requited me accordingly. The Phy&s;icians general|ly in the&s;e Parts, agree before hand for the Cure with their Patients, for a certainty, according to the Condi|tion of the Patient, and his Di&s;temper, and have &s;e|curity for their Money, but yet it is not paid to them, before the Patient is cured. They have a great many Phy&s;icians, but they are very unskilful, chiefly the <HI>Turks</HI> which know none but their own Language, and &s;o cannot read the Authors of Phy&s;ick that have writ in another Language, as the <HI>Jews</HI> can. But &s;eeing that the <HI>Jews</HI> are very much addicted to Covetou&s;ne&s;s, they
<PB N="219" REF="125">
endeavour rather to promote their own Intere&s;t, than that of their Patients; &s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> are but &s;lightly provided with Phy&s;icians, and therefore rather die like Flies, than take advi&s;e of their Phy&s;icians, chiefly of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which are not contented with a &s;mall Reward; to this add al&s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> never put any Confi|dence in the <HI>Jews,</HI> and e&s;teem their Coun&s;el but little; and be&s;ides, they believe that God hath already pre-or|dained every one his Death, &s;o that he that is born to be drowned cannot be hanged. And be&s;ides all this, the <HI>Jews</HI> do not &s;tick clo&s;e to them in time of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, but fly pre&s;ently, and fir&s;t of all in time of Sick|ne&s;s (which certainly happens once in Seven Years, if not in Five or &s;ooner) ju&s;t like Hirelings, as they have &s;ufficiently experienced in the la&s;t Plague in the Year 72, with the lo&s;s of &s;everal Per&s;ons of Worth and Quality; chiefly among the re&s;t a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pay-Ma&s;ter, by them called <HI>Daftedar,</HI> and another Eminent <HI>Turk,</HI> and their own Sons, which both of them (although this proferr'd to lay 3000 Duckets, and the other 10000, into the Hands of a third Per&s;on) yet were neglected and le&s;t by their Phy&s;icians and died. It is very much in u&s;e a|mong them, that if any body doth find him&s;elf not well, another puts his Arms cro&s;s before him, and &s;o gra&s;peth him about his Back, and lifteth him up, and &s;ets him down again, and &s;haketh him &s;everal times, ju&s;t as they u&s;e to do Sacks with Corn, to make them lie the clo&s;er and to hold the more. As the Phy&s;icians are, &s;o are al&s;o the Apothecaries, where you find nothing of any great Compo&s;itions, nor purging Electuaries, as <HI>Elect. Diacatholicon, Diaphoenicon,</HI> &amp;c. (although they have the be&s;t Ingredients thereof, for we have them all &s;ent from them) except they be &s;ent to them from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> or <HI>Venice,</HI> &amp;c. If you have occa&s;ion for any Herbs, Roots or Seeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you mu&s;t go your &s;elf, not without great trouble and lo&s;ing of time, and find them either in the Fields, or el&s;e at the Grocers and other Shop-keepers. Among the re&s;t of the things they had, I &s;oon knew the <HI>Rob Ribes</HI> by its ancient Name and plea&s;ant &s;ouri&s;h Ta&s;te, whereof they make a great quantity in this place, and &s;end it further into other Countries, but chiefly to

the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour; wherefore in the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Week they had already gathered &s;everal Sacks full of the Stalks of the true <HI>Ribes</HI> of the <HI>Arabians</HI> (which are hairy, al|mo&s;t two Foot long, and of the thickne&s;s of an Inch, of a greeni&s;h colour, and underneath, as al&s;o <HI>Serapio</HI> mentioneth, reddi&s;h,) from the Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> and brought it to the <HI>Cadi</HI> to make <HI>Rob</HI> of it for him. I &s;aw them lie in his Court-yard, and &s;everal of them were given me to ta&s;te, and to take away with me. What Herbs I found at my return el&s;e, becau&s;e there are but a few of them, therefore I have put them among the re&s;t here-above in a peculiar Chapter. I &s;aw there &s;e|veral &s;trange Birds, and among others &s;ome of a deli|cate green and blue colour, which were about the big|ne&s;s of our Nut-crackers, by them called <HI>Sucuruck,</HI> and by others <HI>Al&s;ecrach.</HI> I al&s;o found their <HI>Alhabari,</HI> which are not unlike our Peacocks, and almo&s;t as big, and could not fly much. Of four-footed Bea&s;ts, I &s;aw &s;eve|veral, and among them &s;ome Civet-Cats, which were brought thither in Caravans, from remote Parts and the <HI>Indies.</HI> In the <HI>Fundique</HI> of the <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> I &s;aw a very &s;harp &s;ighted one like unto a <HI>Lynx,</HI> exactly of the &s;hape of a Cat, &s;o that it was not ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from it, &s;ave only in its bigne&s;s (for it is much higher and &s;limmer). This is a very wild and fierce Bea&s;ts, &s;o that his Keeper him&s;elf was afraid of it. It once got loo&s;e, and got through the Yard below into an Apothecaries Shop, wherein he had ju&s;t then put a great many Gla&s;&s;es that were &s;ent him from <HI>Venice,</HI> whereof it broke the greate&s;t part before it could be taken again. When I was there, a young <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> was carried through the Town to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> It came from the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Parts, and had killed above 20 Men before they could take it. They al&s;o lead daily &s;ome Lions about the Town in &s;mall Chains, which have &s;mall Bells before, that every body may take the &s;ooner Notice of them; they are &s;o tame, that their Keepers &s;ometimes wra&s;tle with them in open Places, neither do they ea&s;ily grow wild, except they &s;hould &s;ee Sheep, then their Keepers have enough to do to keep them off, and to appea&s;e them.

<P>Having ended my Bu&s;ine&s;s I had, and in the mean time received a Letter from my Comrades that were at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> I parted from thence according to their de&s;ire, and came on the 5th. of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 75, to them in <HI>Tri|poli.</HI> After &s;ome Days arrived al&s;o with &s;ome Goods, one of their chiefe&s;t Carriers, which they call <HI>Mokeri,</HI> which &s;wore to me by his Head, that is, he affirmed upon his Faith and Reputation, that the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;haw</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> when he was departing from thence, had &s;ent his Bailiffs to my Lodgings to apprehend me, and to fling me into the publick <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gaol, becau&s;e they were very well a&s;&s;ured, that when I was on the Hills (where they had &s;een me look for Plants) I had ob&s;erved the Situation of the Town, and all the Country very diligently, that I might, when I &s;hould have an opportunity, betray them to their Enemies, and &s;hew them the be&s;t way to take it. But all this was contri|ved that they might have an opportunity to take an <HI>A|varia</HI> on me, as the Merchants call it there in the&s;e Countries, that is to &s;ay, they would accu&s;e me fal&s;ly to make me puni&s;hable, that they might get a &s;um of Money out of me. And the Carrier al&s;o really believed, for as much as he heard of them, that they would not have let me come off for le&s;s than 200 <HI>Saraffi</HI> or Duc|kets, one whereof maketh two of their Gilders. <HI>Thanks be to our Lord God, who hath delivered me from their unju&s;t Accu&s;ations and Contrivances, and brought me &s;afe to this place.</HI> At my arrival at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> when I expected to live &s;ecurely and quietly, and thought that I was pa&s;&s;ed all danger, I fell notwith&s;tanding all this into a|nother; for when my Comrades, and with them al&s;o <HI>Hans &V;lrich Krafft</HI> (yet without any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion) were flung into the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gaol, by the Contrivances
<PB N="222" REF="127">
of &s;ome <HI>Turks,</HI> the &s;ame Rogues had al&s;o a mind to con|trive &s;omething again&s;t me, to bring me in al&s;o. But the <HI>French</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul, <HI>Andrew Bianchi,</HI> who was my very good Patron, took my Part, in &s;o much that he did recover my Liberty by the <HI>Turks,</HI> in &s;pite of my Accu&s;ers and not only got me Licence to walk freely without mole&s;tation in and about the City where-ever I plea&s;ed, but did al&s;o procure me a free and &s;afe Ac|ce&s;s to my Comrades, to &s;ee them in Pri&s;on as often as I plea&s;ed. Into the Pri&s;on wherein they were kept, I mu&s;t always go through three &s;mall and low Doors, which the Keepers did always very freely and without any grumbling open unto me, to go in or out, and &s;ome|times I have &s;taid there all Night with them. I was al|ways in very great hopes that God Almighty would have ordered it &s;o, that their Adver&s;aries might have a|greed with them, &s;o that I and my dear Friend whom I loved as my own Brother, <HI>Hans &V;lrich Krafft,</HI> might have been returned home again with Joy. But it plea&s;ed God to order it other ways, for the Differences grew the longer the more difficult, and were &s;o long produced, that this Young Gentleman, particularly <HI>Hans &V;lrich,</HI> was kept there in this hard Impri&s;onment very near three Years. To tell all that he &s;uffered and endured there, would be too long here; only this I cannot omit to tell you, that he did endure and conquer all the&s;e Troubles and Adver&s;ities (as I did &s;ee my &s;elf) with &s;uch a Cou|rage, Patience and good Conduct, that notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e (although he was almo&s;t left quite Comfortle&s;s) he was rather fit to comfort others than to be comforted. When I went thus in and out to them, I ob&s;erved very well that the <HI>Turks</HI> have very great Compa&s;&s;ion on poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pri&s;oners, and are very free to give them Alms, and a Man u&s;ed to come in daily with Bread or boiled Meat, as Rice, and other &s;orts of boiled Corn, chiefly on Fea&s;t-Days after the Afternoons Lecture was over, and when he di&s;tributed them, he did al&s;o always as he went by, fling in for each of them a little Loaf (very like unto them they Bake in Lent in our Country) into their Apartment before them upon the Ground, wherewith they mu&s;t make &s;hift, except they could live
<PB N="223" REF="127">
of their own means, or get &s;omething by their Hand-labour (whereof there was a good many that did) to maintain them&s;elves. The&s;e Alms the <HI>Turks</HI> give ra|ther freely, without being ask'd for it, for they believe that God is better plea&s;ed with that which they give freely, than that which is begged of them. Wherefore they have very few or no Beggars in their Towns, which beg Alms as they do in our Country. During my &s;tay at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> I did at the reque&s;t of the Con&s;ul, live in his <HI>Fundique,</HI> who entertained me very honourably, that I might give Attendance, and if any of the Merchants or Sea-men, &s;hould happen to be &s;ick, I might u&s;e my be&s;t endeavour to cure them. So I did in the &s;pace of three Months, cure, only in our <HI>Fundique,</HI> above Forty Men of all &s;orts of Di&s;tempers, <HI>viz.</HI> malignant Fevers, violent Gripings of the Guts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which generally befell them that were lately arrived, and were not yet acquainted with the Air and Diet of the Country. There happened in the&s;e Days, a mi&s;erable cruel Ca&s;e, that &s;ome (among whom were Five <HI>Italians</HI> and One <HI>French-man</HI>) did ar|rive at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> which made them&s;elves &s;oon ready to go from thence further to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> with their Merchandices to &s;ell there. Upon the Road they left their Caravan too far behind them, and met with &s;ome Hor&s;e-men, which &s;poke to them, and de&s;ired them that they would halt at the Command of their Ma&s;ter the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;haw,</HI> and di&s;mount, and go into the next <HI>Camp</HI> (which I found very de&s;olate and ruined when I went by for|merly) to &s;tay there until he came to them, which would not be long, for he had &s;omething to &s;ay to them; the Merchants obeyed them readily, fearing that if they &s;hould not, they would be puni&s;hed &s;everely by the <HI>Sub-Ba&s;haw</HI> for their Di&s;obedience. After they were gone into the Camp, the Murderers immediately fell upon them, Shooting and Striking at them, until they killed them all at la&s;t, then they buried them in the Ground, mounted their Hor&s;es and rode away. Af|ter the&s;e Murderers thought they were very &s;ecure, one of the&s;e Rogues (which were &s;aid to be <HI>Arabians</HI>) met one of the <HI>Mockeri</HI> or Carriers of the &s;ame Caravan, he knew the Hor&s;e immediately, and perceiving it to be
<PB N="224" REF="128">
bloody, his Heart gave him that it was not right, where|fore he made ha&s;te up to him, and thru&s;t his bended Bagonet into his &s;ide, and took him Pri&s;oner, and car|ried him to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where he was (as I did hear after|wards) having confe&s;&s;ed the Fact when he was upon the Torture, executed for it. They did al&s;o &s;eek for the re&s;t, but did apprehend none of them in the time of my &s;taying. The <HI>Sultan</HI> el&s;e taketh great Care to keep the Roads &s;afe and free from High-way Men, that Trading may go on without hinderance. Yet &s;ometimes there are &s;ome of the great ones, and Men of Note, that put others upon it for gain's &s;ake, &s;o that one mu&s;t be very careful in the&s;e Countries. It is not long ago when we had News, that not far off the Chri&s;tians had taken &s;ome Ships from the <HI>Turks,</HI> and carried them off, and al&s;o formerly in the beginning of <HI>July</HI> of the la&s;t Year, they lo&s;t &s;ome more, and as I am informed, among them were Four great ones, Three Fliboats, and Two other, that were taken by Six Gallies of the Chri&s;tians, which made the <HI>Turks</HI> mightily di&s;contented; where|fore the Emperour &s;ends out many Gallies into &s;eve|ral places, chiefly to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> to cro&s;s the Seas up and down to keep them clear from Pirates, and to hinder them from making Incur&s;ions or De&s;cents upon him. The&s;e come &s;ometimes into this Port, but our Mer|chants and the Ma&s;ters of our Ships do not care for their arrival, for they are forced to pre&s;ent them with Cloths, Woollen Cloaths, Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if they will re|main in Favour with them.</P>

<P>WHen I &s;tayed with the Con&s;ul at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> and had not a few of his in cure, in his <HI>Fundique,</HI> &s;ome others of other Nations did &s;ometimes between

whiles de&s;ire my A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Advice, and among the re&s;t, an Eminent <HI>Patriarch</HI> of the <HI>Maronites,</HI> which reckon them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, and are called &s;o from the Heretick <HI>Maro</HI> to this Day. This did live in the Mount of <HI>Libanus,</HI> and was carried down (although he had a whole Day's Journey to <HI>Tripoli,</HI> and was af|flicted with that painful Di&s;temper the <HI>Gout</HI> very &s;e|verely) to be cured by me. After &s;ome Days when he was pretty well recovered again, &s;o that he intended to return home, he &s;poke to &s;ome of us in our <HI>Fundique,</HI> that we would be plea&s;ed to conduct him up the Hill home again, which was agreed unto very readily, con|&s;idering that this Mountain is the mo&s;t Famous in all the Country of <HI>Syria,</HI> whereof the Holy Scripture maketh &s;everal times mention, &s;peaking of its great Height and Famous Rivers (of which <HI>Jordan</HI> is one) of its &s;weet &s;melling Plants, and plea&s;antly ta&s;ted Fruits; and al&s;o becau&s;e there is a great many &s;trange Plants to be found. So we rode along with the <HI>Patriarch</HI> (who had no little rea&s;on to be afraid of the <HI>Turks</HI> clande&s;tine A&s;&s;ault) with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, and came immediately from the Town upon the heights of the Promontories of the Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> which were very Fruitful at the Top, and had many plea&s;ant plain Fields, which extended them&s;elves for three Leagues to the high Mount, &s;o that this was a very plea&s;ant Road, where we &s;aw &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, delicate Vineyards, then on the other, fruitful Fields &s;owed with Barley, white <HI>Indian</HI> Millet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this we came to plea|&s;ant Woods, where &s;weet &s;inging Birds let them|&s;elves be heard, and recreated us; &s;ometimes we &s;aw &s;ome Hares and &s;ome Deer, &s;o that we could not but fan&s;ie that we went through thick and dark Woods. When we came out of them, and were very near unto the Mountain, there lay &s;ome &s;mall Villages before it, and we went to one of them, and very near unto it in a green &s;hady Place we &s;ate down, and refre&s;hed our &s;elves with &s;ome Victuals, which we had taken along with us, before we began to go up the Mountain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patriarch</HI> was very merry with us, and pre&s;ented us with &s;ome <HI>Venice</HI>-Bottles of his Wine, whereof we
<PB N="226" REF="129">
drank a good deal, for it was &s;o plea&s;ant that I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I never in all my Life drank any like it. Soon after we broke up again, with an Intention to reach his Mona&s;tery that Night, called our <HI>Ladies,</HI> which lieth on the middle of the Mountain as we &s;o travelled towards the Top thereof; in the beginning we came in|to a narrow, and rough Valley, which had on both &s;ides very &s;teep Walls, wherewith it was enclo&s;ed, of a va&s;t Height, chiefly at our left Hand, and yet towards the Top there were &s;everal Caves within them, wherein <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> live, whereof we &s;aw a great many that ap|peared &s;o near to the edges as they went about, that we that travelled underneath had much to do to keep us from being giddy. In that place (where from the Height one may plainly &s;ee the whole Neighbourhood to the very Seas, as if it was a <HI>Specula,</HI> &s;uch as the An|cients u&s;ed to have) is always a &s;trong Watch kept by the Inhabitants of the&s;e Mountains (becau&s;e they are not under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Turks,</HI> as others are, nor in any League with them) to hinder the <HI>Turks</HI> from making Incur&s;ions upon them. When we went fur|ther, and got over &s;ome little Hills, we came out of this narrow Place into wide Meadows, Pa&s;tures, Corn fields, and to &s;ome fruitful Vineyards: Then again into narrow and deep rocky Roads where we had enough to do to climb over: And afterwards again into plea&s;ant Groves, by delightful Rivolets that aro&s;e from Springs that made &s;o &s;weet a Noi&s;e, that tho&s;e Mountains are therefore ad|mired and commended, chiefly by King <HI>Solomon</HI> in the 4th Chapter of his Song, ver&s;e 15th in Compari&s;on, where he mentioneth the Streams from <HI>Lebanon,</HI> which make <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and delicious Places in the World.</P>
<P>On this Mount grow here and there, be&s;ides ordinary Trees and Bu&s;hes, thick &s;hrubby Vines, <HI>Zizipha alba &amp; rutila, Poplars,</HI> two kinds of <HI>Dwarf-Cedars</HI> with point|ed and obtu&s;e Leaves, <HI>Eupatorium Me&s;uae, Ab&s;inthium Ponticum, Elaeagni Math.</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Sei|&s;e&s;un</HI>; and wild Horn-beams, a peculiar &s;ort of Willows, <HI>Phyllireas, Styrax</HI>-Trees, the fragrant Gum whereof is to be found in Apothecaries Shops: But chiefly, and in
<PB N="227" REF="129">
the greate&s;t Number were the Maple-Trees, which are large, big, high, and expand them&s;elves very much with their Branches. After we had re&s;ted our &s;elves, and were a little refre&s;hed underneath the&s;e, our Labour began again, to climb up the&s;e high and &s;teep Steps. When we were thus a climbing, &s;ome Country-People (that we &s;aw up &s;o high before) came out of their Caves down to us, with Muggs full of Wine, which they pre|&s;ented fir&s;t to their Ma&s;ter the <HI>Patriarch</HI> that was on Hor&s;e-back, receiving him with a great deal of Reve|rence (bowing them&s;elves down to his Feet) and loving Kindne&s;s, and afterwards they did detain us al&s;o, and pre&s;ented each of us with a Mug of Wine, to bid us welcome, which I and the re&s;t received very willingly, but having pretty well heated my &s;elf with going, I at that time loved &s;pring-water with Bread dipt in it very well, I only ta&s;ted a little of it. After we were got up the&s;e Stairs, a great many more came running to pre&s;ent their Ma&s;ter with Chickens, Pullets and other Poultry, which his Man took and carried it up with them. Then the ways were pretty good, and much &s;traighter &s;o that we went on apace, until at length we came to the Mona&s;tery, which we could not &s;ee before we came ju&s;t upon it. Ju&s;t before it without is a mo&s;t incomparable copious Spring, that &s;loweth with delicate Water, which is worthy to be often vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>This Mona&s;tery (which is not extraordinarily built) lieth toward the left, almo&s;t in the middle of the Moun|tain under a great Rock, which doth &s;o cover and pre|&s;erve it, that it cannot ea&s;ily receive any harm from a|bove. At our Arrival the <HI>Monks</HI> came immediately, whereof I &s;aw no more but Ten, and received us very kindly, and &s;hewed us pre&s;ently our Lodging, which becau&s;e they had no Chambers to &s;pare, was an arched Chapel, that we might know whither to repair: Yet we kept more upon the Top of the Hou&s;e (which was like others covered with Plai&s;ter) which was the deli|cate&s;t and plea&s;ante&s;t Place of all the Buildings, where we could &s;ee the Situation of the &s;nowy Hill towards the Ea&s;t above the Cedars, which was a very plea&s;ant &s;ight, and al&s;o below us &s;everal other Hills, whereon they feed
<PB N="228" REF="130">
their Cattle, together with the deep and dark Valley: And, the Mona&s;tery being but &s;mall, &s;o that they had not much room in it, we al&s;o &s;upp'd there in the open Air, with the <HI>Patriarch</HI> and &s;ome of his Fraternity, on a long Table. They treated us very well, and gave us &s;ome white-wine to drink (which was better than that we drunk on the Hill) in <HI>Venice</HI> Gla&s;&s;es, the like whereof is not to be found neither in <HI>Candia</HI> nor <HI>Cyprus.</HI> But they fed, according to their Order, onely upon plain Food as Beans and <HI>French</HI>-Beans, and the like leguminous Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At Night when they conducted us to our Chambers to go to re&s;t, they &s;hewed us in&s;tead of Beds &s;ome Straw-Mats, and Tape&s;try &s;pread upon the Ground in their Church on which we were to lie, and &s;o we did and re&s;ted that Night. In the Morning they came very early before break of Day into the Church, when we were &s;till very &s;leepy, to do their Office, and began immediately to ring two Bells, which made underneath the Rock &s;uch a re&s;ounding Noi&s;e, that it &s;tupified us and made us (chiefly becau&s;e &s;ome of us had heard none in two Years time, and were full of Sleep and but half awake) &s;o dull, that we did not for a good while know where we were, until we came a little to our &s;elves again. Afterwards I heard them with Attention for a good while, and did look into their Books which were written with <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters: But what Religion they were of, I &s;hall tell you hereafter, when I &s;hall make mention of other <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>At break of the Day we made our &s;elves ready to go further up the Hill, to the Height thereof where the Cedars &s;tand, to &s;ee them, &s;o that we might come to the Mona&s;tery again. Along with us went two Monks to &s;hew us the way; they conducted us back again to the rich Springs of Water, to the Stairs, which were very rough, and &s;o &s;teep that we were often forced to hold our &s;elves by the Bu&s;hes, which we could reach at both Sides; but chiefly when we turned on a &s;udden, of which Turnings they had very many. So we got up higher and higher, with a great deal of Labour, until we came to a little Chapel &s;tanding ju&s;t at the Top of the Stairs, on the Hill. Near to this Chapel is a &s;mall Village,

which we went through, and &s;aw &s;pacious Fields well cultivated, &s;o that the Inhabitants of the&s;e Mountains, could have no want of Corn, Wine, Fle&s;h or Oil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> although their Neighbours &s;hould not &s;upply them for Years with any thing: And be&s;ides, their Lands are &s;o well &s;ecured on the Height, and &s;o locked up, as if they were &s;urrounded with high Walls and deep Ditches: And moreover they are very a &s;tout and warlike-People, very well provided with Bows and Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that their Neighbours cannot ea&s;ily hurt nor do any Mi&s;|chief to them; and they are al&s;o &s;oon alarmed, which we found, when the&s;e two <HI>Monks</HI> did immediately rai&s;e twelve Men well armed, in the furthermo&s;t Village to|wards the &s;nowy Hill, to conduct us &s;afe up to the Cedars of the highe&s;t Mount, that their Neighbours the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> might not hurt us. But as I under&s;tood after|wards the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> are in Confederacy with the Inhabi|tants of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> &s;o that they need not to fear any harm from them. But they rather did it to frighten us, to get a good Recompence from us that they might rejoice, and treat us the better (as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) on our return. So the&s;e Twelve went before us and con|ducted us up to another but very barren and rough Plain, where we found our &s;elves to be upon the highe&s;t point of the Mountain, and &s;aw nothing higher but onely a &s;mall Hill before us, all covered over with Snow, at the Bottom whereof the high <HI>Cedar</HI>-Trees were &s;tanding, &s;ome whereof King <HI>Solomon</HI> ordered to be cut down to be employed for the u&s;e of the building of the Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And although this Hill hath in former Ages been quite covered over with Cedars, yet they are &s;ince &s;o decrea&s;ed, that I could tell no more but Twenty Four that &s;tood round about in a Circle and Two others, the Branches whereof are quite decayed for Age. I al&s;o went about in this place to look out for &s;ome young ones, but could find none at all. The&s;e Trees are green all the Year long, have &s;trong Stems that are &s;everal Fathoms about, and are as high as our Firr-Trees. They have very large Twigs that bend the Tree, and make it lean that way, which &s;omewhat &s;poileth their Straightne&s;s. Branches grow up &s;treight, as al&s;o do the
<PB N="230" REF="131">
Cones thereof, which are large and round, and extend them&s;elves a great length, in &s;o delicate and plea&s;ant, Order and Evenne&s;s, as if they were trim'd, and made even with a great deal of Diligence, &s;o that at a Di|&s;tance, you may &s;ee the Tops of them very even to one another. So that one may immediately &s;ee at a great Di&s;tance, a great Difference between the&s;e and other Firr-Trees. They are el&s;e very like unto the Larch-Trees chiefly in their Leaves, which are &s;mall, and all clo&s;e together, but &s;tand further a&s;under upon &s;mall brown Shoots, which in their Length and Bigne&s;s are like unto them of the <HI>Mu&s;cus terre&s;tris.</HI></P>
<P>After we had re&s;ted awhile underneath the Cedars, and began to be coldi&s;h in this windy, &s;nowy and cold place, we began to return to the Mona&s;tery again. By the way I &s;aw about the River three &s;orts of <HI>Tragacanth,</HI> one whereof I took according to its Shape to be that of the learned <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius,</HI> which is very like unto the True <HI>Tragacantha.</HI> The Second is &s;omewhat lower than the Fir&s;t, el&s;e it is very like unto it, only it beareth Yellow Flowers, each whereof groweth by its &s;elf in round yellowi&s;h bags, and &s;everal of them &s;tand one above the other on long Stalks. The Third is almo&s;t of the &s;ame Height, and hath more brown coloured &s;trong Stalks, with white woolly heads of <HI>Poterius,</HI> whereon you &s;ee purple coloured Flowers. I found al&s;o by them another Plant, which to be brief, (con&s;idering its brown coloured flexible Twigs, and longi&s;h fat Leaves&punc; is very like unto the <HI>Chamaelea,</HI> of a very &s;harp Ta&s;te) I think to be the fir&s;t kind of <HI>Sanamu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">da</HI> of <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e I &s;aw hereabout two thorny Shrubs, one whereof was with its red coloured Grapes (&s;etting the Leaves a&s;ide as far as I remember) very like unto our <HI>Oxy|acantha.</HI> The other which was full of Thorns, and had &s;mall red purple coloured Flowers, was like into the fir&s;t kind of <HI>Scorpius</HI> of <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius.</HI> Among the Bu&s;hes I &s;aw the <HI>Scorzonera</HI> with yellow Flowers, and al&s;o a pretty &s;ort of <HI>Tulips</HI> with yellow &s;tripes, and not far from it the true <HI>Ribes</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> which I found in Autumn at an ill time, without Flowers or Seeds, only with two Leaves, as if it was ju&s;t &s;prung up. The Leaves
<PB N="231" REF="131">
thereof are rough and round, as big very near as tho&s;e of <HI>Peta&s;ites</HI> (called Butterburn in our Language) which grow upon &s;hort yet thick Stalks, which are al&s;o full of a plea&s;ant &s;owri&s;h Juice, as well as their Stalks, where|of chiefly the True <HI>Rob Ribes</HI> is prepared, as I have &s;een it my &s;elf, and <HI>Serapio</HI> te&s;tifieth. This loveth moi&s;t Grounds, hath a &s;trong brown coloured Root, which is pretty long, wrinkly, bended, and of a very unplea&s;ant Ta&s;te. On the hight of the Mount I &s;aw more Plants, &s;ome whereof I had not time to mind, and others that are not yet known, wherefore I omit (for &s;hortne&s;s &s;ake) to &s;ay more of them.</P>
<P>The Mountain is very high, &s;o that it may be &s;een in <HI>Cyprus</HI> about 200 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles off; wherefore the Day breaketh later at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> and not until the Morning Sun appeareth before it: And moreover you find there Snow all Summer long, which they bring down from the Moun|tains, into the <HI>Batzars</HI> or Exchanges to &s;ell, to cool their Drink with it chiefly in the Dog days, and fling it in by handfuls. Yet when we were at the Top, we could not &s;ee far about, being hindered by &s;ome Hills.</P>
<P>After we were come down from the Mountains into the little Village again, our Conductors brought us into a plea&s;ant Garden where their Wives came to us, which brought to us &s;everal yet &s;trange &s;orts of Milk-Meats to eat, and very good Wine to drink, &s;o we &s;at down in the Gra&s;s according to their Fa&s;hion, to eat and drink, and to make merry, and &s;poke to them in the common <HI>Arabian</HI> Country Language, and what we could not &s;peak out, we made them under&s;tand by Signs. After we had dined, we returned them many thanks, for all their Kindne&s;s and good Chear, and &s;o we went away. By the way we &s;aw more Plants, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Aly&s;&s;um</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;c.</HI>; a delicate kind of <HI>Cynoglo&s;&s;um.</HI> And al&s;o near the Stairs &s;ome wild Fir-Trees, <HI>Polium Montanum, Mar|rubium Creticum Lobelii,</HI> as I judged according to its &s;hape. A delicate yellow <HI>Jacea</HI> with &s;caly Heads, and prickles like unto the <HI>Spina Sol&s;titialis,</HI> which is low, yet it hath a long and &s;trong Root, covered with a gray and hairy Rind, like unto the <HI>Victorialis,</HI> the Leaves are jag|ged or laciniated, of an A&s;hen colour and hairy, as al&s;o
<PB N="232" REF="132">
the two before mentioned; and another kind of <HI>Jacea,</HI> with purple coloured Flowers, which is very like unto the yellow one of <HI>Lobelius</HI> (which I have al&s;o found in <HI>Provence</HI> in <HI>France</HI> near <HI>Aix</HI>) &s;aving only the prickles that are about the Heads. Ju&s;t before we came quite down I found two kinds of <HI>Linaria,</HI> one whereof (that is of a pretty bitter Ta&s;te) puts forth long and &s;lender Stalks from the Root, clo&s;ely &s;urrounded with a great number of <HI>Linaria</HI> Leaves, and hath at top one, two or three long &s;caly Heads, from whence i&s;&s;ue &s;mall purple coloured Flowers; the other groweth al&s;o in Leaves and Stalks almo&s;t like unto the fir&s;t, only they are &s;maller and tenderer, and hath quite to the top abundance of light and &s;mall purple coloured Flowers round about it (as the blue one of our Gardens). At length after a long travelling and climbing, we came ju&s;t when the Night broke in, down to the Mona&s;tery again; after Supper we went &s;trait to re&s;t, that we might be up early again to go for <HI>Tripoli.</HI> After break of the Day when we had taken our leave of the <HI>Patriarch</HI> and his Brethren, and made our &s;elves ready for our Journey, we came &s;trait away. By the way we &s;aw &s;everal of <HI>Arbores Judae,</HI> with their red coloured Husks; and al&s;o in the Rock a fine <HI>Gnapha|lium,</HI> with A&s;h coloured roundi&s;h, Mou&s;e-ear Leaves, and Snow-white double Flowers. As we went on, and were almo&s;t come to the Hou&s;e that &s;tood upon the height, whereof we made mention before, the&s;e Inhabitants came down again, got before us, &s;topt us, and would not let us pa&s;s until we had drunk with them. Then we went on again, and I found in the deep and dark Valley the right <HI>Medium Dio&s;coridis,</HI> and <HI>Mindium Rhazis,</HI> which I did &s;pie immediately among the Bu&s;hes, by its hight and &s;pecious purple coloured Flower. This Plant is very like unto the <HI>Viola Mariana,</HI> of the learned <HI>Rem|pert Dodonus,</HI> very &s;tately, &s;o that no great Difference can be found but only in the Leaves, which in this are more carved, like unto tho&s;e of <HI>Plantain,</HI> and in the Flowers which are more open, and &s;pread them&s;elves with their long and narrow Leaves, (whereof each hath eight) into a round Circle; the Seeds I &s;aw not becau&s;e they were not yet ripe, yet I found a greater Au&s;terity in the Root
<PB N="233" REF="132">
than in the Seed Ve&s;&s;els. Not far off, I al&s;o &s;aw in the Val|ley a &s;trange Plant, which was of the height of a Cubit, and had whiti&s;h and woolly Leaves, like unto our <HI>Mullein,</HI> only they are le&s;s, and grow quite to the Stalk, as tho&s;e of <HI>Tabaco,</HI> or of <HI>Hyo&s;cyamus Peruvianus,</HI> of <HI>Rempert Dodon,</HI> at the top thereof grow fine purple coloured and white dou|ble Flowers which &s;tand clo&s;e together, as tho&s;e of the yel|low <HI>Amaranth,</HI> or in the little <HI>Auricula Muris</HI> of <HI>Fuch&s;i|us,</HI> &s;o that according to all this, having al&s;o fragrant Roots, and like unto tho&s;e of black <HI>Hellebore</HI> (which broke be|cau&s;e I pulled it up in ha&s;te) as I judged by that part there|of which &s;till was left to them, I clearly take it to be the true <HI>Baccharis</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;cor.</HI> In the Valley further down towards the Water, grew al&s;o the <HI>Oleander,</HI> and the <HI>Apocy|num Repens,</HI> which climbeth upon the Trees that &s;tand nigh it, and covereth them &s;o that it hangeth down again at the &s;ides, like the <HI>Ephedra</HI> of <HI>Pliny.</HI> After we came out before the Mountain, there appeareth the <HI>Italian Sphon|dylium, Vi&s;nagia, &amp;c.</HI> there we went into the next Village, and looked after the Victuals we had left, to refre&s;h our &s;elves. When we came from thence I found the black <HI>Cha|maeleon</HI> with its hand&s;ome blue coloured Tops; <HI>Origanum, Onites, Lycium</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Zaroa</HI> by the Inhabitants, the &s;econd <HI>Acacia</HI> with trefoil Leaves, and when we came near to <HI>Tripoli,</HI> to the old and high Rivolet, between the Moun|tains, I found the &s;econd <HI>Tragoriganum</HI> of <HI>Carol. Clu&s;ius Ceterach</HI> and low St. <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Wort,</HI> a fine <HI>Chamaedrys,</HI> &amp;c. but above all, a Thorn-bu&s;h, about the height of a Cubit, very thick of Twigs and Stalks, &s;o that &s;ome of them lie upon the Ground: The Stalks (whereof many grow out of a Root of a drying quality, and &s;omewhat bitter) are &s;urrounded with a tender gray Rind, underneath which is another reddi&s;h one to be found. Its long tender Leaves that grow one again&s;t the other (which are of the colour of A&s;hes underneath, and green above) are very like unto the Leaves of our <HI>Sangui&s;orba</HI>; between them at the Top or the Crown &s;prout out many Thorns, the bigge&s;t where|of divide them&s;elves at the Top into other le&s;s ones in very good order, &s;o that &s;ome point down, and &s;ome up|wards, and others towards the &s;ides, and &s;ome thereof &s;prout out further before the re&s;t, which &s;prout our early in the Spring, and bear &s;mall greeni&s;h coloured &s;tarry
<PB N="234" REF="133">
Flowers; from underneath them grow out &s;mall &s;oft Berries of a whiti&s;h Colour, and &s;ome reddi&s;h, which are &s;o clo&s;e together, and &s;tand in their Ranks, (at the Top whereof the Flower is &s;till plainly to be &s;een) like unto our Currans. The Seeds thereof I have rai&s;ed in the famous Garden of the Generous and eminent <HI>Hans Heinrich Herwarts,</HI> Alderman of this Place, very ea&s;ily and they grew up until they were ready to blow: But as other <HI>Outlandi&s;h</HI> Plants do &s;eldom endure our Climate, &s;o did this al&s;o die the next Winter. It is called by the Inhabitants <HI>Bellen.</HI> But I am of Opinion, according to its &s;hape, (for of its Virtue and U&s;e, I can &s;ay nothing becau&s;e I never tried it) that it is the <HI>Hippophi&euml;</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;cor.</HI> &s;o long until others give me a better in&s;truction. Not far from hence I found on the Height, near to the Town in a rough place, another fine Plant, not unlike unto our <HI>Gingidium,</HI> only that it hath le&s;s Fenil Leaves and beareth a roundi&s;h Seed, with many &s;mooth Wings hanging round about it, which clo&s;e them&s;elves almo&s;t into a Knot together, with its tender Leaves, which &s;prout out underneath the Crown, like unto the black Coriander: Which induced me to enquire after it, more narrowly what to call it, and being I found that it had a &s;mall white Root, tender Leaves, and a bitterer Ta&s;te than our wild <HI>Par&s;nip,</HI> and al&s;o in the middle of the Crown a blew|i&s;h Knob, I cannot judge it but to be the true <HI>Gingidium</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;cor.</HI> From thence we &s;oon went down the Stairs again, and came by &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> burying-Places, and &s;ome wild Figg-Trees, by them called <HI>Mumeitz</HI> (where|of a great many are growing in the&s;e Grounds) into the Town of <HI>Tripoli.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after an hone&s;t and skillful <HI>Botani&s;t,</HI> to whom I came to inquire after Plants, told me that a great many more were to be found thereabout. Wherefore I went out again to look for them, and to get them al&s;o. So I found fir&s;t upon the Height near the Vineyards a <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia Mon&s;pelien&s;ium,</HI> which be called <HI>Mackmudi</HI> and <HI>Mack|mi&s;i,</HI> and the Berries thereof <HI>Habel Mickenes.</HI> But whe|ther this is to be taken for the <HI>Avac&s;ium Rha&s;is,</HI> or no I cannot certainly affirm. This is &s;o common in the&s;e places that they make Brooms of its Twigs. Moreover I found in the Vineyards another &s;tately fine and &s;trange
<PB N="235" REF="133">
Plant, which was about two Cubits high, and had whi|ti&s;h, woolly, and long, &s;harp pointed Leaves, which are &s;et round with &s;mall prickles about the edges, and had on each &s;ide towards the Stalk little Ears, as our Sorrel and Spinage have: It is of a bitter Ta&s;te, and at the Top there|of on long Stalks grow many &s;mooth Hands which in their bigne&s;s and Flowers are very like unto the yellow <HI>Jacea.</HI></P>
<P>But that I may not be too tedious (it being not my In|tention to treat here of every one at length) I will men|tion but one more before I conclude, which I found ju&s;t at the Spouts where in Rainy Weather the Water runs down from the Mount of <HI>Libanus</HI>; which is the true white <HI>Behen</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and is &s;till to this Day called <HI>Behmen-ahied,</HI> as the red is called <HI>Behmen-ackmar,</HI> which al&s;o doth not &s;tand far off, as my Friend that ex|perienced Botani&s;t hath informed me. But becau&s;e I was daily ready to go on Ship board, to come home again, I had not time to obtain it; this was at that time almo&s;t decayed, yet I found &s;till &s;ome green Leaves about it, &s;o that by all appearance, it doth endure the Winter, and &s;o &s;hoots out a new by degrees, which grow up yearly a|gain in&s;tead of the old ones, the&s;e put forth long great and pointed Leaves, as big, &s;harp and as thick as a Leafe of a Pear-Tree; they have partly under|neath on the Stalks four much le&s;s, which &s;tand two and two again&s;t one another; and one al&s;o finds out a few of them on round Stalks (many whereof grow out of the &s;ame Root, about the height of a Cubit) where the up|permo&s;t &s;tick quite clo&s;e to it, as you may &s;ee on the <HI>Smyrnium Creticum</HI>; On the Top it puts forth oblong &s;caly yellow Buttons, each of them on their peculiar Stalk, from whence i&s;&s;ue Flowers of the &s;ame colour; it hath a very long Root, which at the Top &s;hoots out great Branches, that grow &s;o thick, that in time they may be &s;eparated and tran&s;planted; but el&s;e they have but very few Fibers, &s;o that they rather are &s;mooth, and al&s;o almo&s;t as tough and pliable as Liquori&s;h Root, to which it is very like in its bigne&s;s and colour, only it is &s;ome|what whiter, and not &s;o &s;trait. But why <HI>Avicen</HI> maketh mention al&s;o of its wrinkles, I am of Opinion that he rather &s;peaketh of the greater &s;ort, which is more wrinkly and rougher, and al&s;o for above a Span long, &s;eem to be

&s;hrunk of Age and turned woody, or decayed and dried up, although within they are &s;till juicy, limber, and have kept their natural colour.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving here before made mention of the <HI>Maronites</HI> and <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> their Neighbours and Allies, I cannot but mu&s;t al&s;o go further, and briefly relate, how the <HI>Turk</HI> did make War again&s;t them (as to whom they are not yet quite &s;ubjected) during the time of my &s;taying in the&s;e Countries. But from whence this War did fir&s;t ari&s;e, and had its beginning, I was thus informed, that it broke out about one of their Governours, which lived then for a little time at <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> For when the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> did ob&s;erve that the&s;e People did daily grow in Number and Strength, he con&s;idered, that if he &s;hould let them go on &s;o, and neglect to curb them in time, they might probably after a while grow too Potent for him; wherefore he thought it requi&s;ite, to &s;tudy and make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to find out ways and means to &s;ubdue them and to reduce them under his Power. In order thereunto,
<PB N="237" REF="134">
he apprehended the Governour that lived then in <HI>Dama|&s;cus,</HI> and put him into Pri&s;on, and at length took away his Life unju&s;tly under pretence as if he had endeavoured to rai&s;e a Rebellion; not doubting but that when he had removed their Head, he might the ea&s;ier &s;ubdue and re|duce the&s;e People. But when the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> and <HI>Maronites</HI> under&s;tood this cruel and abominable Fact, not without Grief and Trouble, they were not only not at all di&s;coura|ged from re&s;i&s;ting &s;o Great and Formidable an Enemy, but rather took new Courage that was promoted by the great Anger this dete&s;table Fact put them into, &s;o that they united them&s;elves the firmer, and did unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olve to oppo&s;e him with all their Might and Power, and to &s;tand by their ancient Liberty; and accordingly they began immediately to Arm them&s;elves, to Fortifie their Villages, and chiefly their Pa&s;&s;es, and to provide them|&s;elves with Guns, Bows and Arrows, and all other things nece&s;&s;ary for their Defence, &s;o that in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity they might be ready to re&s;i&s;t their Enemies, being &s;uch a kind, that kept neither Faith nor Promi&s;es, which they had often experienced to their great Grief and Lo&s;&s;es. So that in all probability it was like to be a War, which al&s;o broke out with great Violence within a little time after. But becau&s;e I went for <HI>Bagdet</HI> at the &s;ame time (where in former Years the Potent <HI>Caliphi</HI> did re&s;ide) I did hear no more of it in all my Journey until at my return, when my Comrade <HI>Hans &V;lrich Krafft</HI> of <HI>&V;lm,</HI> then Pri&s;oner in <HI>Tripoli,</HI> did relate it to me, &s;o as it was reported to him by Credible Hands; who told me that the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> are very numerous, that they were divided into &s;everal Regi|ments, of &s;everal colours, and that tho&s;e that live in the middle of the high Mountains were the mo&s;t nume|rous of them all, that they live in a Country that is very well &s;ecured and &s;urrounded, &s;o that they need not, nor will not be &s;ubject either to the <HI>Turks</HI> or any other Po|tentate. They are Warlike People, for the generality good Gunners, that make their own Guns and any o|ther &s;orts of Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have plenty of Corn, Oyl, Wine, good Meat and good Fruit, &s;o that they need not any A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Strangers. They chiefly deal in Silk, whereof they wind (from Silkworms) about 100 Ro|tulas in a Year (which is about 450 Hundred weights)
<PB N="238" REF="135">
to &s;end from thence into other Countries. The&s;e have their white Colours, and their Confederates that live on the outward Hill toward the Sea, at <HI>Baruti</HI> near <HI>Tripoli,</HI> have red ones, and have al&s;o their Colonel which they call <HI>Ermin Mackfur,</HI> which al&s;o tho&s;e that belong unto the white Colours acknowledge to be theirs, as well as their own (which was lately murdered.) This becau&s;e he could not entrench him&s;elf as well as the other <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> on the Hill, agreed with the Great <HI>Sultan,</HI> and made Peace, upon this account, that if he would let him live peace|ably and quietly, he would help him to Protect the Country, and pay unto him yearly the accu&s;tomed Tri|bute, but if the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> would not be plea&s;ed with this proferr, he would join the re&s;t and a&s;&s;i&s;t them. The Emperour accepted of this, and did not only make this <HI>Ermin Mackfur</HI> Lord of all <HI>Baruti</HI> and <HI>Seide,</HI> called <HI>Sidon,</HI> but did al&s;o procure him a great and plentifull Yearly Revenue out of the&s;e Countries; thinking thus to oblige him, to help him with his <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> to &s;ubdue the others, not doubting but that he might ea&s;ily overcome the&s;e, when once the others on the Mountains were killed. But they would not get up the Hill, but did proferr to the <HI>Turks,</HI> that if their Men and the <HI>Moors</HI> would go up, they would be ready in the Valley about <HI>Baruti,</HI> to cut off all that &s;hould fall into their hands. This An&s;wer they gave to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> only for Fa&s;hion's &s;ake, for no <HI>Tru&s;cus</HI> killeth the other. When the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;aw that they would not bite one another, and that he was not like to obtain any great matter from the Colonel, he did notwith&s;tanding &s;end up the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> with Six other <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> and Seventeen <HI>Sangiacks</HI> about Two Hundred Thou&s;and &s;trong, both Foot and Hor&s;e well Armed, to &s;ubdue the before-mentioned <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> which were about Sixty Thou&s;and &s;trong, to burn, de|moli&s;h and de&s;troy their Towns, Villages, Hou&s;es and Plantations. After they were come up to the A&s;cent Two Days Journey from <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> they found the Roads &s;o &s;teep that no body could pa&s;s them on Hor&s;e|back, for there was nothing to be &s;een but rough and &s;harp-pointed Rocks. So they agreed to di&s;mount, and to go up to them on Foot, and &s;o they took pre&s;ently Six or Seven Villages (whereof there is &s;aid to be Twenty
<PB N="239" REF="135">
Seven in all) but they found nothing in them but &s;ome Women and Children and very few Men (the re&s;t were got upon the Hills where they had intrenched them&s;elves) which were all cut in pieces, and the Villages burnt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> thought them&s;elves obliged, ac|cording to their Emperours Command, to go on further, &s;o they endeavoured and got up higher, but could not do any more harm to the <HI>Tru&s;ci,</HI> being hindered by the bad ways: But on the contrary the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> met them &s;ome|times and poured their Shot upon them from all Sides, be|fore they were aware of it, &s;o that they were but in an ill Condition. Then when the <HI>Turks</HI> would pur&s;ue the&s;e Men, they were too quick for them, as being born and bred in the&s;e Mountains; &s;o they did only laugh at them, and bid them ki&s;s their Breeches: So the <HI>Turks</HI> (partly for want of Provi&s;ion, partly being tired by the &s;teep Roads) were &s;ometimes forced, not without great damage and lo&s;s of their Men, to retire again to take better Mea|&s;ures. Sometimes al&s;o the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> would &s;tand between the Rocks covered and when they found any of their Enemies appear, chiefly tho&s;e that endeavoured to climb up the Rocks, they would all of a &s;udden &s;hoot among them as among a Flock of Pigeons, &s;o that many of them did precipitate them&s;elves and broke their Necks. They would al&s;o &s;ometimes decoy the <HI>Turks</HI> into a good Road and after Eight or Ten Thou&s;and of them were pa&s;&s;ed, they would with Six Thou&s;and <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> fall in the Rear of them, to drive them up higher, where others &s;oon did appear that came down upon them: &s;o they &s;urrounded them &s;ome|times, and received them &s;o warmly, that but very few of them came back again to tell what was become of the re&s;t. After this War had continued for about two Months, the <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> at la&s;t was forced to make a &s;hameful Re|treat with the Remainder of his Forces, and that &s;o much the &s;ooner becau&s;e the Winter began to approach, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to endure the Fro&s;t and Snow, which occa&s;ioned many to die, and the chiefe&s;t of them came home &s;ick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> pretend to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e that &s;ome Years ago by Might and Strength re|covered the Holy Land; &s;o that &s;till to this Day, they have a great Affection for <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which tho&s;e that
<PB N="240" REF="136">
travel among them to buy Silks can te&s;tifie, whom they treat and entertain very civilly with good Meat and good Wine, yet refu&s;e to take any Money for it: And &s;ay, That what God hath given them they are bound to di|&s;tribute among us <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> But they hate <HI>Mahome|tans</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> and keep very good Intelligence with the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of this Country. Yet they them&s;elves are nei|ther <HI>Chri&s;tians, Turks, Moors</HI> nor <HI>Jews:</HI> For they do not go to Ma&s;s, nor any other publick Wor&s;hip of God: They cry out &s;ometimes to Heaven that God would be plea&s;ed to protect them. They al&s;o believe, according to the Opinion of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> that the Souls of the de|cea&s;ed according to their Merits, tran&s;migrate from one Body into another; That the Soul of a pious Man goeth into a new-born Child, and that of an ill Man into the Body of a Dog or other wild Bea&s;t; chiefly if he hath lived very ill. As they believe &s;o they live al&s;o. Among them they marry to their neare&s;t Relations, the Brother to his Si&s;ter, the Son to his Mother, the Father to the Daughter, and they lie all together at Night, but they will not marry into a &s;trange Family. The Father or the Mother &s;ays, Seeing that God hath given me this Child as a Seed unto me, why &s;hould I throw it away upon a Stranger? or el&s;e, I have a Garden, and God giveth me Flowers in it, is it not rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould enjoy them rather than a Stranger? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they make u&s;e of a great many of the&s;e and the like Expre&s;&s;ions. They al&s;o keep a Yearly Fea&s;t with their Wives which then they change one with the other as they plea&s;e. El&s;e they are not given to &s;tealing, killing, or any &s;uch like Crimes (be|cau&s;e they want for nothing) but if any be taken that hath thus tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed he is executed immediately. So they live in Peace together, and care not for any other Monarch.</P>

<P>AFter my Return to <HI>Tripoli,</HI> when I found my &s;elf near to the Confines of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Land of Promi&s;e, promi&s;ed and given to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> by the Lord of <HI>Zebaoth,</HI> and con&s;idered, that, our long before promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> Lord and Saviour of the

Gentiles, was there, according to the Prophecies of the Prophets, born in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and by the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;uffered the &s;hameful Death of Crucifixion at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> on the Mount of <HI>Calvaria,</HI> and afterwards was laid in the New Tomb of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea,</HI> that was cut out of a Rock, &amp;c. I found in me a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the&s;e and other the like holy Places: Not that I thought &s;till to find there <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, as the two young Men, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and the three <HI>Maries</HI> did, but to exerci&s;e my outward Sen&s;es in the Contemplation thereof, that I might the more fervently con&s;ider with my inward ones his bitter Pa&s;&s;ion, Death, Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion, and to appropriate to my &s;elf, and to apprehend the better, and to make my own, by Faith&punc; and firm Confidence, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord him&s;elf together with his Heavenly Gifts and Trea&s;ures, as he has manife&s;ted him&s;elf in the Holy Scriptures; wherefore I was fully re&s;olved to look out for Fellow-Travellers, to accompany me in this Jour|ney, before I returned home again. I &s;taid not long in que&s;t of Company, but quickly met with four <HI>Pil|grims</HI> that came out of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> that had the &s;ame intention: there al&s;o came to us a <HI>Grecian</HI> Monk, of the Order of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> whom I knew before when he lived with his Ma&s;ter, that I cured of a very dangerous Di&s;temper, and de&s;ired to go in company with us. So we agreed together, and be&s;poke a &s;mall <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el with eight Oars, by them called <HI>Cara|mu&s;ala,</HI> whereof there were many in the Harbour, that wait con&s;tantly for Travellers, Goods and Provi|&s;ion, to be carried into the Neighbouring Towns and Provinces, <HI>vix.</HI> to <HI>Antiochia, Caramania,</HI> anciently call|ed <HI>Cilicia, Cyprus, Baruthi, Caramania,</HI> or quite into <HI>Egypt.</HI> We bought &s;ome Bi&s;quets, Cibets, Eggs, Chee&s;e, Pompions, which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Baticcas, Margeropfel,</HI> Oranges, good Wine, &amp;c. which we had occa&s;ion of, for our Journey, of which as much as would la&s;t us eight days: for the Ship-Ma&s;ters, do not willingly land, chiefly with Pilgrims, becau&s;e of the great Cu&s;toms the Rogui&s;h <HI>Turks</HI> demand unju&s;tly from us <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> every where, until we arrive at our de|&s;igned Stations.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="137">After we had thus fitted our &s;elves, and got a good Wind, we went aboard the Ship on the Seventh of <HI>September,</HI> in the Year 1575, and put off, and came before Night to the Point <HI>Capugio,</HI> to the Village <HI>Aniffe,</HI> anciently called <HI>Neuphrus,</HI> which was in former Ages very well Fortified, as &s;till appeareth by &s;ome Re|mainders to this Day. This Village is pretty big, but every where open, that one might ea&s;ily take it with a handful of Men: it is &s;ituated on the Foot of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> which is very high there, and reacheth unto the Sea. It is chiefly inhabited by <HI>Maronites,</HI> as are al&s;o many more Villages of this Mountain, chiefly tho&s;e that lie in Valleys towards <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where I have inned many times, when I went through it, and was very kindly received: they keep very good Wine by them, which the <HI>Turks</HI> know very well, and come there very often for it (altho they are forbidden by the Laws of their <HI>Mahumetan Alcoran</HI>) to &s;atisfie their De&s;ire. The&s;e <HI>Maronites</HI> are <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and &s;peak the <HI>Arabian</HI> Lan|guage, and have their <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> which are fir&s;t cho|&s;en by the People, and then confirmed by the <HI>Pope.</HI> After we had went on from thence very well all Night long, all along the &s;teep mountainous Shore, and had made the utmo&s;t Point of the Promontory of <HI>Ba|ruthi,</HI> we &s;aw in the morning a far off that famous Town, lying behind it where formerly great Com|merce has been drove, well fortified with &s;trong Towers towards the Sea, and &s;urrounded with fruitful Orchards and Vineyards. In this, and al&s;o in more adjacent Towns and Villages, live a very War-like People, called <HI>Tru&s;ci,</HI> very nimble and expert in &s;hoot|ing with Guns and Bows, and call them&s;elves the po|&s;terity of the ancient <HI>French</HI> Men, which took and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many years agon under <HI>Godfrid</HI> and <HI>Baldwin, Jeru&s;alem</HI> and all the Land of Promi&s;e. They are &s;till a Free People to this Day, and not &s;ubject unto the Great <HI>Sultan,</HI> as others are; wherefore he hath many times attempted to bring them under his Yoak. And in order thereunto he did &s;end in the Year 1574 la&s;t pa&s;t, a great Army con&s;i&s;ting of Two hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, to &s;ubdue them; but what harm he
<PB N="260" REF="138">
did them I have already mentioned in the precedent part of this Journal. They are very willing to accom|modate and &s;erve Outlandi&s;h <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as <HI>Germans, French Men</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> whereof they make no Diffe|rence, and to take them up into their Habitations, and to &s;hew them all Civility and Kindne&s;s: nay, and what is more, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them according to their utmo&s;t Power again&s;t the Common Enemy of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> as we have formerly found indeed, before <HI>Cyprus</HI> was ta|ken by the <HI>Turks</HI>: for after they were informed, that &s;ome <HI>Italian</HI> Gallies were to arrive to make an Incur|&s;ion into the adjacent Towns and Places, chiefly to plunder <HI>Tripoli,</HI> they rai&s;ed Seven thou&s;and Men very well armed to help them, and to come to their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, &s;ome of which did then appear and &s;hew them|&s;elves on the Frontiers: but finding that their Gallies did not arrive, they al&s;o returned home again, and left their De&s;ign unaccompli&s;hed. The <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> have a Head called <HI>Ermin Macksur,</HI> that is a judicious Man, and a very experienced Soldier, whom they acknowledge to be their Supreme Governour, and are obedient to him: he liveth in a Ca&s;tle on the bottom of the Mountain, not far from the Town we went by; he taketh great pains, chiefly now after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> War, and maketh great Provi&s;ion to keep the Country in Peace and Se|curity. He al&s;o keepeth good Corre&s;pondence with the Neighbouring People, chiefly the <HI>Maronites,</HI> (that have lived long before in the&s;e Mountains) with whom he hath lately renewed the old Confederacy again, as I know very well, and their <HI>Patriarch</HI> him&s;elf was with him, before I was called to cure him of his Di&s;temper. He al&s;o leaveth no Stone unturned to get in with o|thers, and to make them his Confederates: &s;o he hath already &s;ecured to him&s;elf the <HI>Syrians</HI> (which are al&s;o <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> yet not without gro&s;s Errors) by paying to them a yearly Pen&s;ion. The&s;e &s;peak al&s;o <HI>Arabick,</HI> and are very like unto them in Shape, Man|ners, Fa&s;hion and Cloaths; and I &s;ound two of them among our Seamen, that confirmed this to me.</P>
<P>After we had gone on a great while, and were pa&s;|&s;ed by the Point of the Promontory of <HI>Baruti,</HI> which
<PB N="261" REF="138">
extendeth it &s;elf far into the Sea, our Ship-Ma&s;ter (who was a <HI>Turk,</HI> and under&s;tood the <HI>Arabian</HI> Lan|guage) &s;hewed me a Village lying beyond it, called <HI>Burgi,</HI> and told me, that that was al&s;o inhabited al|together by <HI>Harani Quibir,</HI> that is great Robbers and Murtherers, as they always call the&s;e People. But I being better informed before-hand, I prayed by my &s;elf that God would be plea&s;ed to let the poor Slaves that live in hard Servitude under the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were the&s;e they call <HI>Harani:</HI> and I do not at all que&s;tion, but they would &s;oon take their Refuge to them, to make them&s;elves free of their Servitude, as tho&s;e might ea&s;ily do, that live about the&s;e Countries in <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aw al&s;o upon the Shoar &s;ome ancient Towers, and among them chiefly two, which are renewed again, wherein the <HI>Tru&s;ci</HI> keep Watches to ob&s;erve the Pirates, but the others, whereof there are a great many, not above a League di&s;tant from one another, are for the greate&s;t part by Age decayed. Some &s;ay that they were for|merly built by the potent Emperors, that if any Nation &s;hould ri&s;e up in Rebellion, they might immediately give notice thereof to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The&s;e gave no|tice, before Guns were invented, in the Night by a flaming Fire, and by Day-time by a great Smoak. And they &s;till keep to this in many places, altho Guns are now invented.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon we were becalmed, and &s;o our Journey went on but &s;lowly, we &s;aw late at Night a &s;mall Village called <HI>Carniola</HI> upon the height: and &s;oon after at the Foot of the high Mount of <HI>Libanus,</HI> South|ward of the City of <HI>Sidon,</HI> by the Inhabitants &s;till called <HI>Scida,</HI> which is not very great, but as far as I could &s;ee, very well built, and defended by two Ca&s;tles, one whereof is &s;ituated towards the North on a high Rock, the other on a little Hill Tho&s;e that are going to <HI>Sa|phet,</HI> which is a Days Journey di&s;tant from it, land there. Before we could reach it, Night befel us, and brought contrary Winds, which hindered us &s;o much, that we could hardly reach the glorious and rich Town of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> now by the Inhabitants called <HI>Sur,</HI> which lieth
<PB N="262" REF="139">
in a manner clo&s;e to it, until the next Morning. This is &s;till pretty large, and lieth on a Rock in the Sea, about Five hundred Paces di&s;tant from the Shoar of <HI>Phenicia.</HI> In former Ages <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great did be|&s;iege it for Seven Months, and during the Siege he filled up the Streight of the Sea, and did join it to the Continent, and after he had taken it, he laid it into A&s;hes, &s;o that Puni&s;hment was inflicted on the Inhabi|tants which the Prophet <HI>E&s;aias</HI> denounced again&s;t them Four hundred years before.</P>
<P>On the Confines of <HI>Tirus</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> that <HI>Cananean</HI> Woman came to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on behalf of her Daughter, that was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an unclean Spirit, whereof the Lord, &s;eeing her Faith, did deliver her immedi|ately.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before it we heard a great noi&s;e of large run|ning Springs, which ri&s;e within the Country with &s;o great a vehemency, that they drive &s;everal Mills. Within a large di&s;tance from thence, we &s;aw a very fine new Hou&s;e called <HI>Nacora.</HI></P>
<P>Two Miles farther near Mount <HI>Saron</HI> within, South|ward, we &s;aw a large Village called <HI>Sib,</HI> without it in the Sea round about were &s;everal Banks and Rocks, behind which we hid our &s;elves, the Wind being con|trary, and &s;taid for a more favourable one; in the mean while, &s;ome of our Men got out among the Rocks to catch Fi&s;h, and to find Oi&s;ters, where they al&s;o gathered &s;o much Sea-&s;alt, that they filled up a great Sack with it.</P>
<P>Between this and Mount <HI>Carmelo,</HI> which are Eight Leagues di&s;tant, and run out a great way into the Seas, lieth almo&s;t in the middle thereof, as it were in a Half Moon, the famous Town of <HI>Acon,</HI> anciently called <HI>Ptolemais,</HI> on a high Rocky Shoar, which &s;ome years ago, when <HI>Baldewin,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Gotefrid,</HI> fir&s;t, and <HI>Guidon</HI> after him, did po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Holy Land, was not without great Lo&s;s of many Men taken by them, from <HI>Saladine</HI> King of the <HI>Sara|cens</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which had (after &s;ome obtained Victo|ries) &s;urrendered it &s;elf again a &s;econd time, after a long Siege. This Town hath very good Fields of a
<PB N="263" REF="139">
fertil Soil about it, and is at this time, together with the Land of Promi&s;e and others, to the great grief of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) &s;ubjected under the Yoak and Slavery of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Wind favouring us, we hoi&s;ted up our Sails, and got out at Sea, with le&s;s danger to get before the Point of the Mountain: but our De&s;ign was fru&s;trated; for about Noon a contrary Wind a|ro&s;e, which did not only hinder us in our Cour&s;e, but violently drove us back again, &s;o that we were forced to have recour&s;e to our old Shelter behind the Rocks again. After Midnight, when it began to be calm, and another Wind aro&s;e, we put out two hours before Break of Day, and went all along the Shoar towards the Town <HI>Hayphe,</HI> formerly called <HI>Caypha,</HI> or <HI>Porphyria,</HI> Four Leagues beyond <HI>Acon,</HI> lying ju&s;t within Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> where on the Evening when we came very near it, &s;everal Frigats came out of all &s;ides to &s;urround us. As &s;oon as the Ma&s;ter of our Ship perceived them, he did not like it, wherefore he let fall his Sails, and ex|horted his Men to ply their Oars warmly to get clear of them. When they &s;aw they could not reach us, they left their De&s;ign and went back; but we landed without on that Mount <HI>Carmelo,</HI> to put out again in the Night. This Mountain is very high and famous in Scri|pture; for we read in the Third Book of the <HI>Kings,</HI> and the Eighteenth Chapter, that the holy Prophet <HI>Elias</HI> called before him upon the Hill the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Four hundred and Fifty of <HI>Baal</HI>'s Prie&s;ts, and and the Four hundred of <HI>Hayns,</HI> to chide them for their Idolatry: where al&s;o God heard him, and con|&s;umed his Sacrifice by Fire that came down from Heaven; but the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal</HI> were not only not heard by their Idols, but kill'd as Idolaters near the River <HI>Ki&s;on</HI>: and al&s;o in the Fifth of the Epi&s;tle of <HI>James:</HI> that after the Heavens had been lock'd up for the &s;pace of three years and a half, <HI>Elias</HI> did pray to God on this &s;ame Mount, and the Lord heard him, and let Rain fall down upon the dry and barren Earth. From this Mountain, the (pre&s;umed) holy Or|der of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> taketh its Name, which was fir&s;t
<PB N="264" REF="140">
there endu'd with &s;everal Priviledges, by Pope <HI>Inno|cent</HI> the Third, and <HI>Albert</HI> the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the Year 1205; and afterwards when they were encrea&s;ed to a great number, under pretence of great|er Holine&s;s, confirmed by the Name of the Brothers of our Lady, by Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> the Third, in the Year 1226. The&s;e pretend to be Followers of the Do|ctrine of <HI>Cyrillus,</HI> wear daily black girded Coats, and over it, when they &s;ay Ma&s;s, white Monks Habit. Some years ago without doubt, have a great many of this Order lived here about, as &s;till to this day doth appear by their Cloi&s;ters and Churches, which by Age are &s;o mightily decay'd, that they are left de&s;erted, and uninhabited. This Mountain is al&s;o round about towards the Sea Coa&s;t very bare and rough, that we may very well &s;ay with the holy Prophet <HI>Amos,</HI> That the Pa&s;tures of the Herd&s;men &s;hall look mi&s;erably, and the top of the Mountain dry up.</P>
<P>The Town <HI>Hayphe</HI> lieth at the bottom of the Mount <HI>Carmelo,</HI> is pretty large, but very ill Built, and the Hou&s;es are &s;o decay'd, that half of it is not fit to be Inhabited. <HI>Salidinus</HI> King of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who in his time carried on long and heavy Wars again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and was almo&s;t hardly able to re&s;i&s;t them, cau&s;ed the Walls of it, and al&s;o that of <HI>Cae&s;area</HI> in <HI>Pale&s;tina,</HI> and others of le&s;s &s;trength, to be pull'd down, that his Enemies might not find any place of Reception again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Out of this Port (as we are afterwards informed) was a little time before taken away a pretty large and richly Loaden Ship, by &s;ome Pirates, which vexed the Inhabitants very much, and being that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> chiefly were &s;u&s;pected by them, they had a great de|&s;ire to revenge it upon them again; &s;o that we, had not our Ma&s;ter been very hone&s;t, &s;hould have &s;uffer'd for the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>After we had lain there at Anchor till after Mid|night, not without danger, as you mu&s;t imagine, our Ma&s;ter made ha&s;te to get out to Sea, although it was very calm, in hopes to get good Weather. After they had wrought very hard, a good Wind aro&s;e behind us
<PB N="265" REF="140">
towards the Morning, and drove us along, &s;o that we got &s;oon about, and pa&s;&s;ed the Point of the Mountain, and &s;aw the Country of the other &s;ide, which was above on the height &s;o Plea&s;ant, Green and Shady, that there in a Village re&s;ides a <HI>Turki&s;h Sangiach</HI> for Plea&s;ure &s;ake.</P>
<P>Not far from thence lieth the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> in the Sea, by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Altlit,</HI> where mo&s;t of them touch that take their way through <HI>Galilaea</HI> and <HI>Nazareth</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> This hath been in former Ages &s;o well Fortify'd with Walls and Ba&s;tions, that it was thought to be Impregnable; but now it is on two &s;ides towards the Sea, &s;o demoli&s;h'd and de|&s;troy'd, that one may very rea&s;onably gue&s;s, that it hath been formerly taken by Storm.</P>
<P>The Wind &s;till increa&s;ing more and more, we went on with &s;uch a &s;wiftne&s;s, that although two little Ships per&s;ued us towards Morning, yet they were for|ced to leave us, and &s;o we &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the Ca&s;tle, and came towards <HI>Dor,</HI> three Leagues di&s;tance from thence; it lieth near Mount <HI>Carmel</HI> in the Country of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> te&s;tifieth; and it is &s;o decay'd that there is nothing more extant, than a large and high Tower, which the Inhabitants &s;till call <HI>Dortaite.</HI> In this Coun|try, when the <HI>Jews</HI> took <HI>Canaan</HI> the Land of Promi&s;e, they let the Inhabitants remain, as you may read in the fir&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Judges.</HI></P>
<P>At a League di&s;tance from thence, you &s;ee the An|cient and Famous Town <HI>Cae&s;area</HI> of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> &s;ituated on the Sea on a high Bank, which King <HI>Herod</HI> did re|new, and call'd it after the Emperor <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> which &s;till to this day, among the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> retaineth its ancient Name <HI>Kae&s;arie.</HI> In this Town did live the Pious Centurion <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who was Baptiz'd there with his whole Family by <HI>Peter</HI> the Apo&s;tle (who was called thither from the Town <HI>Joppe</HI>): There did al&s;o live <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> (one of the &s;even <HI>Deacons</HI>) into who&s;e Hou&s;e the Holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> did go, and &s;taid there &s;ome days; where al&s;o the Prophet <HI>Agabus</HI> did foretel him, That he was to be made a Pri&s;oner at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Now although this Town in tho&s;e days
<PB N="266" REF="141">
was very well built, as one may &s;till &s;ee by the im+portant and &s;tately Antiquities that are &s;till remaining there, yet now in our times it is in Walls and Buildings &s;o mightily decay'd, that it is hardly fit to be Inhabited, much le&s;s to be Defended, or to make any Re&s;i&s;tance. And for all that it is &s;till pretty large, but &s;o lone&s;om, and depopulated, that we could hardly &s;ee any body in the large and broad Streets thereof as we pa&s;&s;ed by.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A &s;hort Relation of my Travels by Land from the Harbor of</HI> Joppe, <HI>to the City of</HI> Je|ru&s;alem.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Morning early as &s;oon as the day did appear, which was the 13th day of <HI>September</HI> 1575, we got on &s;hore, and di&s;patched immediately &s;ome to the Town of <HI>Rama,</HI> two Leagues di&s;tant from thence, to get us a &s;afe Conduct, or Pa&s;s, from the <HI>Sangiach,</HI> and to bring along with them &s;ome <HI>Mockeri,</HI> or A&s;s-driving Carriers, to provide us Carriage to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> In the mean while we &s;tay'd upon the high Rocky &s;hore, where the Town <HI>Joppe</HI> did &s;tand formerly, which at this time was &s;o Demoli&s;h'd, that there was not one Hou&s;e to be found, where the Pilgrims at their arrival could &s;helter them&s;elves, &s;ave only three large Vaults, which went very deep into the Hill, and extended
<PB N="267" REF="141">
them&s;elves towards the Sea. Into the&s;e are &s;ometimes the Pilgrims let in, but being that at that time, a great deal of Corn was laid up there, whereunto they &s;till daily added, on purpo&s;e to &s;upply <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> during the &s;carcity, it was forbidden that any Body &s;hould be let in.</P>
<P>The Town <HI>Joppe,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Japha,</HI> is by its old Name very well known to us, by the Books of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, &amp;c. where we Read. That the Prophet <HI>Jonas</HI> (when the Lord bid him to Preach to the <HI>Ninevites</HI> De&s;olation and De&s;truction) for fear did retire thither, and there took Ship, where he was thrown out into the Seas in the great Storm and Tempe&s;t, and &s;wallow'd up by a great Fi&s;h; and after he had been there for three Days and Nights he was vomited out again. And we read al&s;o in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in the 9th and 10th Chapter, from <HI>Peter</HI> the Apo&s;tle, That he lay (or tarry'd) for a while at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Simon</HI> the Tanner, where he rai&s;ed the Si&s;ter <HI>Tabitha</HI> from the Dead, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Joppe</HI> at that time was very well Built and Fortify'd, which doth appear, becau&s;e a good many of the <HI>Jews</HI> did, at the time of the De&s;olation of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> retire thither, to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Might of the <HI>Romans,</HI> although it was but in vain; for being that the time of the puni&s;hment, that was to befal them, was at hand, the City therefore was two &s;everal times one after another, be&s;ieged and taken, and demoli&s;h'd, and as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> te&s;tifieth, about 12600 <HI>Jews</HI> were killed in it. We al&s;o read, That after the time of <HI>Gotfrid de Boullion,</HI> when the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> lo&s;t again the Land of Promi&s;e, that then this Town al&s;o was retaken again by the Infidels, and razed to the Foundations; &s;o that now there are no Antiquities at all to be &s;een. And I &s;hould have doubted very much whether there did ever &s;tand &s;uch a Town there, had not I &s;een &s;ome large pieces of the Ancient Town Walls &s;till remaining, which are &s;o near to the Sea, that there is hardly room to go at the out&s;ide of them.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="142">Hard by this I &s;uppo&s;e was the Habitation of <HI>Simon</HI> the Tanner, where <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ojourned, becau&s;e the Evan|geli&s;t St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;aith, That it was near to the Sea &s;hore.</P>
<P>Above it on the height &s;tand two Towers, where &s;ome Watchmen attend to look after the Vaults and Ships in the Harbor, that they may not be a&s;&s;aulted by the Pirates; this Harbor, although it is &s;urrounded with Rocks and Banks, yet it is but very &s;lightly &s;ecu|red, and very narrow and &s;hallow, &s;o that Ships of any great bulk, or heavy Laden, cannot ride in it.</P>
<P>Near to them growth the <HI>Hemerocallis,</HI> which I have al&s;o found about <HI>Montpelier</HI> and <HI>Aigemort</HI> near to the Sea. And al&s;o in the adjacent Moi&s;t and Ma&s;hy Mea|dows, I found a delicate kind of <HI>Limonium</HI> which hath about ten or twelve <HI>A&s;pleniun</HI> or <HI>Ceterach</HI> Leaves on both &s;ides; the&s;e proceed from a long Root of a brown colour without, and red within; between them &s;prout out two three-&s;quare Stalks, about a Cubit high, with a great many Joints, that have three long &s;mall Leaves, and are adorned at the top with beautiful and &s;tately blue and purple coloured Flowers; they are of a dry|i&s;h Nature, and the Inhabitants u&s;e to eat them in Sallads.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after Dinner our Men returned, and brought along with them the Pa&s;s and the Carriers; our Ma&s;ter of the Ship left &s;ome of the Crew in his <HI>Caramu&s;ala</HI> to look after it in our ab&s;ence: We Mount|ed and went away, and came &s;oon into the plain Fields where <HI>Jonathas</HI> &s;lew <HI>Apollonius</HI> the Captain, as is &s;aid in the 1&s;t of <HI>Maccabees</HI> the 10th Chapter.</P>
<P>Soon after we &s;aw a plea&s;ant Village call'd <HI>Ja&s;ura,</HI> and when we came a little nearer, a Camp of a great <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lord, who &s;ent (as &s;oon as he e&s;py'd us on the Road, and found that we were Pilgrims) &s;ome of his Men to us, to call us before him, and al&s;o to tell us, That he was one of them to whom the Grand <HI>Sultan</HI> had given Charge of the <HI>Temple,</HI> and the Mount <HI>Calva|ria,</HI> with &s;trict order to let no Pilgrim in before they had paid a certain &s;um of Money. So we went along with them, and appeared before him in his Tent, put
<PB N="269" REF="142">
our Right Hand on our Brea&s;t, bended our &s;elves for|wards, and made him (according to their Cu&s;tom) his Compliments. After he had look'd upon us a great while, he bid his Men to receive the Money of us; &s;o each of us paid him Nine Ducats that had their full weight, except the <HI>Grecian</HI> who paid only Five, and at their Reque&s;t we &s;taid with them all Night, becau&s;e their Ma&s;ter intended to &s;end a Janizary with us the next day, to let us into the Temple. This Lord, who was an Eunuch, had a great many Offices; for in the&s;e Countries they are by the great ones, as <HI>Ba&s;haws, Sangi|achs, Cadees,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o much e&s;teemed, that in their ab&s;ence they make them Stewards over all their Goods and Chattels, Wives and Children, &amp;c.</P>
<P>At that time he was there to gather great quantity of Corn from the&s;e fruitful Countries, it being Har|ve&s;t time, and to &s;end it from thence to <HI>Joppe,</HI> to go by Sea for <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>After Midnight we mounted again, and came early in the Morning to the Town <HI>Rama,</HI> and went into the Hou&s;e of the Pilgrims, which <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI> bought, and gave it to the Pilgrims as their Inn. This is very large, and hath a great many Arched Chambers within, and a fine Well; within the Inner Court is a pretty large place, all grown over with green Aloes, the Juice whereof is brought over to us in large pieces, from the Ea&s;tern Countries, and is ve|ry u&s;eful in many tedious Di&s;tempers: <HI>Nicodemus</HI> did al&s;o bring with him, (together with) Myrrh to the quantity of 100 pounds, to the Grave of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, to Bury his Body decently according to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, as you may read in the 19th Chapter of St. <HI>John.</HI> Here we &s;taid almo&s;t three days, and had all along enough to do to agree with the <HI>Cadi Suba|&s;haw Clerks, Janizaries</HI> and <HI>Paityfs,</HI> &amp;c. about our free pa&s;&s;age; &s;o Unju&s;t, Malicious, and Infidel a Peo|ple are they, that one would hardly believe it.</P>
<P>The Town is &s;ituated on an A&s;cent in plain Fields, as is before &s;aid, which extend them&s;elves for two Leagues to the Hill of the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The&s;e Fields are very Fruitful, and very well Tilled and Sown
<PB N="270" REF="143">
with Corn, Cotton, and <HI>Indian</HI> Millet. Hereabouts do al&s;o grow <HI>Indian</HI> Muskmelions in great quantity, by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Batiere,</HI> which are very plea&s;ant and well ta&s;ted, chiefly tho&s;e that are red within: &s;o that in all my Travels I hardly met with the like.</P>
<P>The Town is pretty large, but very open like unto a Village, very pityfully built, where one may &s;till &s;ee here and there &s;ome &s;igns of old Building,</P>
<P>From thence Northwards within half a League lieth the Town <HI>Dio&s;polis,</HI> formerly called <HI>Lidda,</HI> where <HI>Peter</HI> did vi&s;it the Saints, and cured one named <HI>Aeneas,</HI> that had had a Pal&s;ie for Eight Years. Nothing el&s;e is to be &s;een there, but the Church of St. <HI>George,</HI> whom the <HI>Turks</HI> chiefly honour, as a Knigt and <HI>Hero,</HI> before all other Saints. After they had quite tired us, during this time, with their continual Impertinencies, we agreed with them, and went away early in the Morning, and came in good time over the Plain, to the Mountain of the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to which we had &s;till Four Leagues to travel. By the way there appeared pre|&s;ently on the Mountains &s;everal <HI>Arabians,</HI> and ran be|fore us in great Clu&s;ters to cut us off in our way, with &s;uch violence, that we were almo&s;t forced to come to our defence, and to pu&s;h through them by force: for our <HI>Janizaries</HI> had already flung their Iron Club into the Back-&s;ide of one of them, and had almo&s;t &s;poiled him. When they found us to be in earne&s;t, they took &s;omething to drink of us, and let us alone. So we mu&s;t, before we arrived at the old de&s;troyed and ruinated <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> (where there is no Joy nor Hopes to get any thing, as is in the Heavenly One) &s;oon one after another pay them, ju&s;t like Boys that have lo&s;t their Game, and run the Gauntlet.</P>
<P>After we had endured all the&s;e Bru&s;hes, we went on, and came to the middle of the way of the Mountains, where it was very rough and &s;tony, into a &s;mall Vil|lage called <HI>Anatoth,</HI> lying on a heigth, where we re&s;ted a little, and watered our Bea&s;ts at a very rich Spring, that runs through it by an ancient little Church down the Hill; this is &s;ituated (as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> writes in his Tenth Book and Tenth Chapter of his Antiquities, or
<PB N="271" REF="143">
ancient Hi&s;tory) within Twenty Furlongs of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem.</HI> There was born the holy Prophet <HI>Jeremias,</HI> as you may &s;ee in his Fir&s;t Chapter: and it is al&s;o called by <HI>E&s;aias</HI> a pitiful Village, which, together with the Town <HI>Rama,</HI> did formerly belong to the Inheri|tance of the Children of <HI>Benjamin.</HI> Thither went al&s;o <HI>Abiathar,</HI> when King <HI>Solomon</HI> did depo&s;e or ex|clude him from his Prie&s;thood, to live on his own Ground. A little before it they &s;hewed us at the top of the heigth or <HI>Silo,</HI> of Mount <HI>Ephraim,</HI> &s;ome Re|licts of the Grave of the holy Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> (where we could look about for &s;everal Leagues round) which was of <HI>Rama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ha,</HI> or <HI>Arimathea,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the Ju&s;t whom helped to take <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> down from the Cro&s;s&punc; and did put him into his own new Grave. The Town was underneath the Mountain where the Pro|phet <HI>Samuel</HI> was buried at fir&s;t, but carried up to <HI>Silo,</HI> after the Town was taken.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t when you come to <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Nicopolis</HI> lieth on the Left Hand upon the Heighth, formerly called <HI>Emmaus,</HI> from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Three&s;core Furlongs di&s;tant, as the Scripture telleth us: whither <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did accom|pany the two Di&s;ciples, and explained the Scriptures to them, and at la&s;t made him&s;elf known to them. We left it and went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which is now called <HI>Gotz</HI> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI> The Road is very rough and rocky; &s;o that we &s;aw very little, but on each &s;ide in the Valleys many delicate large Olive Trees, and &s;ome few Vineyards.</P>
<P>The City lieth on the heighth of the Mountains, as the 125th. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> te&s;tifieth. It is not to be &s;een, until you come over the bare and rough Mountains inter|cepting the Pro&s;pect of it on this &s;ide.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before it without, on the top of Mount <HI>Gihon,</HI> are to be &s;een &s;till &s;ome Antiquities of the Town <HI>Helia,</HI> which <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor built after the De&s;olation of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and called it after his own Name <HI>Helia.</HI> This was fir&s;t taken by <HI>Co&s;r&ouml;e,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in the time of the Emperor <HI>Heraclius</HI> (who did overcome him again) and afterwards by <HI>Homar</HI> the Third King of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who demoli&s;hed it; afterwards it was
<PB N="272" REF="144">
more contracted, and &s;omewhat built again in its old place. In the&s;e days it is, as well as all that Country, under the Dominion of the <HI>Turki&s;h Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>Before it we di&s;mounted, for no outlandi&s;h Man hath permi&s;&s;ion to ride into their Towns, and went under the Gate <HI>Hebron,</HI> to &s;tay there for the Father <HI>Guardian,</HI> to whom we had, by one of our Carriers given notice of our Arrival, and al&s;o de&s;ired him to get us Licen&s;e from the <HI>Sangiach</HI> to come in. In the mean time &s;ome Mendicant Friars came out of the Mona&s;tery, and re|ceived us very kindly. Soon after the <HI>Ermin</HI> came al&s;o riding, with his Clerk, and asked us from whence we came, how many there were of us, and what our Names were. And after they had written it down, and every one had paid him his due (to have &s;afe con|duct to &s;ee the holy Places) the <HI>Ermin</HI> promi&s;ed it us, and put his Right Hand upon his Head, (which is the fa&s;hion in the&s;e Countries) and bended forwards to let us know that we might confide in his Promi&s;e. Then they let us pa&s;s, and the Friars conducted us in, to|wards the Left Hand, through &s;ome &s;mall Streets or Lanes, into the Mona&s;tery, which is behind on the Town-Wall towards the We&s;t.</P>
<P>This, although it is not large and &s;pacious, yet is it very hand&s;om, and &s;trong-built: we went into lodge there as all Pilgrims do that come there, where Father <HI>Jeremy</HI> of <HI>Brixen,</HI> a Brother of the Order of the <HI>Mi|norites</HI> of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> a Guardian of the holy Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> (which had been Pre&s;ident of this Mona&s;tery of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and of the other of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> for Eighteen Years together) received us very kindly. There are but very few Monks in it, and they are of all &s;orts of Nations, as <HI>Italians, Spaniards, French</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> yet of the la&s;t named I found not one when I arrived there. The&s;e lead the Pilgrims about, together with an Interpreter, or <HI>Tru&s;chemant,</HI> that under&s;tands the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language, and &s;hew them the holy Places as well within as without the City. But before we went out the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> admoni&s;hed us, that we mu&s;t have a care, and not go to the Graves of the Heathens, which are almo&s;t throughout
<PB N="273" REF="144">
<HI>Turkey</HI> without the Towns, near to the Highways: for if one or more &s;hould, before he was aware of it, which may ea&s;ily happen, go to them, the <HI>Turks</HI> would be very much offended at it, partly becau&s;e they take any one that is not circumci&s;ed, to be unclean, and &s;o they fear that they might make them al&s;o unclean: partly becau&s;e they are very jealous of their Wives, wherefore they permit them not ea&s;ily to walk or ap|pear in the open Street, except they have a mind to go into the Bath or <HI>Pagnio,</HI> or to vi&s;it the Graves of their decea&s;ed Parents or Relations: and where Women are pre&s;ent, every one had be&s;t to come away, to avoid Danger.</P>
<P>After he had &s;aid this, he went on &s;aying, That if any &s;hould be among us, that were come over the Sea hither, that could not bring very good proof, that they did appear before his Holine&s;s the <HI>Pope</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and were there ab&s;olved by him, that &s;uch were in his Holine&s;&s;es Excommunication, and therefore could not be admitted to &s;ee tho&s;e holy Places, much le&s;s obtain the Indulgences, which in former Ages had been left with them, out of great kindne&s;s of the Popes, to be di&s;tributed among the Pilgrims, wherefore he de&s;ired, that every one might &s;hew him their Certificates. All the&s;e Points he u&s;ed to propound to every one that cometh there, in cour&s;e, as I had heard before of &s;e|veral that had been there formerly; that they were very glad to &s;ee Pilgrims arrive, and that they u&s;ed to &s;hew the holy Places to them al&s;o that bring no Recom|mendation from his Holine&s;s the <HI>Pope,</HI> hoping, that they will recompen&s;e them at their Departure. Where|fore I did not much mind this Excommunication, but let that remain in its ancient Credit: but my Com|rades, two whereof were Prie&s;ts that u&s;ed to &s;ay Ma&s;s, were very much a&s;toni&s;h'd at it, and full of Trouble, that they &s;hould be under his Holine&s;s's Ex|communication before they were aware of it: where|fore they began to excu&s;e them&s;elves, and &s;aid, That they did not know any thing of it, neither had they had any opportunity in their Travels to come to <HI>Rome:</HI> But although this had been omitted before their Arri|val,
<PB N="274" REF="145">
yet they would certainly do it as they went back. Notwith&s;tanding all this the <HI>Guardian</HI> &s;eemed to be very earne&s;t, and made &s;hew as if he could not ab&s;olve them; yet at la&s;t, after he had long enough kept them in this fear, he began to declare, that he had al&s;o re|ceived full power from his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and the whole <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Church, to ab&s;olve all tho&s;e that did not bring any Certificates. And &s;o at la&s;t ab&s;olved us in the Cloi&s;ters of his Mona&s;tery in <HI>Latin</HI> with the&s;e Words: <HI>I ab&s;olve you of all your Sins in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And with this he concluded his Speech.</P>

<P>This holy Land (which, according to the Promi&s;e made to the Patriarchs, was for many years in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI>) was (as you read in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> Chap. 8.) a mo&s;t fruitful and rich Country, abounding with Corn, Fruits, Wine and all that is required to the maintenance of Man's Life.

This ought to &s;erve us and all Men as an Example of the fervent Anger of God, to be a warning to us for ever. For if of the Glorious City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which God had cho&s;en before others, and of its va&s;t Buildings, that made her famous before her De&s;olation, there is at this Day nothing at all to be &s;een, &s;o that one might very well doubt, whether it ever &s;tood there, were it not for &s;ome holy places, and its &s;itua|tion, that give us demon&s;tration thereof.

upon us with his wrath (as he hath already begun) and deliver us up into the Hands of our Adver&s;aries, that we may fall by their Swords (as <HI>Ezekiel</HI> doth threaten us in his Thirty ninth Chapter,) and to puni&s;h us according to the De&s;erts of our Sins. Wherefore we ought to lay to heart the terrible Example of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and turn from our evil ways, that we may avoid the Puni&s;hments that befel them. We &s;ee that tho&s;e who were formerly the People of God, are now come to be &s;o blind, and full of Errors, and of &s;o depraved a Life, that there is hardly any like them to be found even among the Infidels and Impious.

Seeing then that there is but little Tillage about the City, therefore the product of the Earth there is but very &s;mall, &s;o that they mu&s;t have almo&s;t all Ne|ce&s;&s;aries brought them from other places.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which is &s;till pretty large; but very ill built, hath within its Walls (which the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor cau&s;ed to be built about Twenty Years ago) large places that lie de&s;olated, and are &s;o full of Stones and Rocks, that one can hardly walk in them. The Gardens (even tho&s;e that are within the City, and are but ill managed) are &s;urrounded with Mud Walls, not above Four Foot high, &s;o that one may climb over them without any difficulty. The&s;e are wa&s;hed down again by Rain in a very little time, &s;o that they want mending continually.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="147">Their Habitations are al&s;o little and and low, have Clay-Walls, and many of them are decayed, &s;ome lie quite in a heap.

But &s;eeing there is nothing &s;o &s;trong in in this World that is not tran&s;itory, therefore is al&s;o this Worldly Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> together with its &s;trong Building and Fortification (which was rather a Type of the true Rock in <HI>Zion,</HI> Chri&s;t our Lord, and his Heavenly Kingdom, and Holy Church that was built thereon) &s;o ruined and de&s;olated, that the greate&s;t and highe&s;t part thereof before the Town, (except a <HI>Turki&s;h Mo&s;che,</HI> &s;ome Tile Hou&s;es and a few Acres of it) lieth quite like a De&s;art, covered with Rocks and Stones.

<P>The great Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Turks</HI> is &s;ituated at the top of the inward part of the Mount, towards the We&s;t Side near the <HI>Fi&s;hgate,</HI> which is al&s;o newly built, and very well &s;urrounded with Walls and Ditches: under the Gate are &s;everal great Guns to frighten the <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> that come thither in great Flocks, chiefly again&s;t great Fea&s;ts from all Nations, <HI>Armenians, Georgians, Aby&s;&s;ins, Latinists,</HI> &amp;c. for they fear that el&s;e the Town might be taken from them again.</P>

<P>As we went about, and came to one of the places, the Monks did &s;hew the Pilgrims in each of them, the Number of the Years for the Pardons laid there by his Holine&s;s, as in &s;ome Seven Years and Seven Indul|gences, but in &s;ome others, as in the place where the Holy Gho&s;t was &s;ent, where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did eat the Pa&s;s|over with his Di&s;ciples, and wa&s;hed their Feet, and where he at &s;everal times appeared when the Doors were &s;hut: and where al&s;o (as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> &s;aith) the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> after the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> her dear Child, did dwell for Fourteeen Years, &amp;c. full Ab&s;o|lution and Indulgences from all Sins and Facts for ever.</P>
<P>Now that all tho&s;e that come there, may receive it more worthily, the Monks exhort them to kneel down before every of &s;uch places, and to pray the Lord's Prayer, and <HI>Ave Maria</HI> with Devotion: and that when they have done &s;o, they need not to doubt, but that they have fully received the Ab&s;olution that was given for that place by his Holine&s;s. After they had thus prayed in &s;everal places, &s;ome of our Company rejoiced mightily, and confe&s;&s;ed, that after it they were holy, and &s;o innocent, that if they &s;hould die then, they were &s;ecure, that their Soul &s;hould go immediate|ly out of their Mouth into Heaven, and eternal life. To this I an&s;wered them: That I expected Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin no other ways but only in the Name, and for the Merits, of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> and that I had not undertaken this Pilgrimage, as they did, to get any thing by it, as by a good Work: nor to vi&s;it Stone and
<PB N="291" REF="153">
Wood to obtain Indulgence: or with opinion to come here nearer to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; becau&s;e all the&s;e things are di|rectly contrary to Scripture. As the Lord him&s;elf &s;aith: <HI>Time will come that you &s;hall neither on this Mount nor at Jeru&s;alem wor&s;hip the Father.</HI> And he al&s;o fore|warneth us of the&s;e that &s;ay; <HI>Lo Chri&s;t is here, Chri&s;t is there, lo he is in the de&s;arts, he is in the Chamber:</HI> that we &s;hould not believe them, nor go out, but rather confide on his promi&s;e, that he will be with us to the end of the World: and where two or three are met together in his Name that he will be in the middle of them. Wherefore our dear Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath no need, becau&s;e he is him&s;elf pre&s;ent with them that believe in him, of any Vicegerent, that &s;hould on Earth u&s;urp &s;uch Power, and take &s;uch Honor and Glory to him|&s;elf, as to give Indulgence at his plea&s;ure: becau&s;e all the&s;e things belong only to God. When I &s;aw that they did not much mind this my Di&s;cour&s;e, I let them alone in their Opinions, but yet I &s;aw here and there all the&s;e places, and con&s;idered by my &s;elf what our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had, by his bitter Sufferings and Death, by his Glorious Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion, procured us from his Heavenly Father. When the Pilgrims came to one of the above-mentioned places of Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> and had &s;aid their Prayers, they went into it, and con|templated it, fell down again before it, and ki&s;&s;ed it with great Submi&s;&s;ion and Devotion; pulled out &s;eve|ral pieces, <HI>viz.</HI> Beads and Ro&s;aries turned of the Wood of the Trees of the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> &s;ome wrought Points, Laces, &amp;c. tied together in Bundles, to touch the holy place with it; they al&s;o knocked off in &s;ome places (where they might) &s;ome &s;mall Pieces, to take them along with them as con&s;ecrated Sanctua|ries, to di&s;tribute them among&s;t their Friends at their Return.</P>

Town <HI>Salem,</HI> and Prie&s;t of the Almighty God, did fir&s;t build a Temple, and therefore named the City <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> So we read in the Second Book of <HI>Chro|nicles,</HI> Chap. iii. That on the &s;ame holy Mount King <HI>Solomon</HI> did begin to build a Hou&s;e for the Lord, at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> many years afterwards. This was for|merly very high, &s;urrounded with deep Ditches and Cliffs, &s;o that it would make a Man giddy to look down from the top into the depth. Wherefore <HI>Pompey</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> took a great deal of pains before they could get upon it, to take and de&s;troy that glorious and well-built Temple, which was in the la&s;t De&s;olation (as well as before in the fir&s;t burnt by <HI>Nabuhcodono&s;or</HI>) de|moli&s;hed and razed to the Foundations, as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> fore|told them, <HI>Mark</HI> xiii. <HI>That there &s;hould not be left one &s;tone upon another that &s;hould not be thrown down, becau&s;e they did not acknowledge the gracious time of their vi&s;i|tation.</HI></P>
<P>And that all hopes might be taken away from the <HI>Jews,</HI> to return and to build the Temple again, to re|e&s;tabli&s;h their Wor&s;hip; <HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperor, to pre|vent all, ordered, in the year of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 134, all to be broken down that was left, and to root it up, to de|moli&s;h all heighths&punc; to fill up all Ditches, to level Cliffs, and to make the Ground even all over: he did al&s;o al|ter the Name and Religion of the Inhabitants, and in|&s;tead thereof introduced the Heatheni&s;h Idolatry. In the place of the Grave of Chri&s;t he built a Temple for the Idol <HI>Jupiter</HI>; on Mount <HI>Calvaria</HI> another for the Idol <HI>Venus</HI>; and another at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> to the Idol <HI>Ado|nis</HI>: and at la&s;t in the place where formerly in the Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> did &s;tand the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> he erected his own Image on a high Column for his memory, which was &s;till &s;tanding, in <HI>Hieronymus</HI>'s time. The heighth of this Mount cannot be ob&s;erved any where el&s;e now then without by the Fountain <HI>Siloah,</HI> and in the Valley of <HI>Benhinnon,</HI> and &s;o it did remain de&s;olate to the times of the great Emperor <HI>Con&s;tan|tine.</HI></P>
<P>After that, when the <HI>Jews</HI> undertook to rebuild the Temple at the Charge of <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate (who
<PB N="295" REF="155">
would make <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> a liar, the Lord having &s;aid that their Hou&s;e &s;hould be left unbuilt) a great Earth|quake (when they had opened the Ground to lay the Foundation) did move and &s;hake the whole place to that degree, that every thing was turned up&s;ide down, and abundance of <HI>Jews</HI> did peri&s;h in it. But when the <HI>Jews</HI> did not matter this, but endeavoured to go on with the Work in hand, the next day Flames of Fire broke out of the Ground, and fiery Beams &s;truck down from Heaven, which de&s;troyed more than the Earth|quake, and burnt all their Tools, <HI>viz.</HI> Saws, Axes, Shovels, Hammers, &amp;c. When the <HI>Jews</HI> would not leave their Error for all this, the night following &s;ome &s;mall glittering Cro&s;&s;es like Stars fell down upon their Cloaths, which they could not wa&s;h off the next Morn|ing, nor get out by any means: and an Earthquake and &s;uch a violent Hurricane came upon it, that it di&s;&s;i|pated all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mortar and other Materials into the Air, &s;o that frightened, and full of fear, they were forced to confe&s;s, that <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> whom their Ance&s;tors Crucified, was the true and only Lord and God.</P>
<P>Seeing that the Temple, together with the Mount it &s;tood upon, are razed and de&s;olated, &s;o that one can hardly now di&s;cern what they have been anciently every one that goeth by (becau&s;e the Lord did not fa|vour his own Hou&s;e, where his Name was &s;anctified) hath rea&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;hed at it, and to call to mind the &s;trange anger of God again&s;t tho&s;e that leave the Lord their God, and adhere to other gods, &s;erve and adore them.</P>
<P>Now adays the <HI>Turks</HI> have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Mount, and all the Ground whereon <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple did &s;tand, and have built a <HI>Mahumetan Mo&s;che</HI> on it; which <HI>Homar</HI> the Third after the great Impo&s;tor <HI>Maho|met</HI> built when he had taken the holy Land and the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> This is not very large nor high, but fine and covered with Lead, hath a great Court Yard a|bout it, paved with white Marble, and here and there Orange and Date Trees are planted in it, which is very plea&s;ant, about the &s;ides thereof are &s;ome high Towers and Gates, one whereof is va&s;tly bigger than any of

the re&s;t, which is near to their <HI>Batzar,</HI> or Exchange, which is very old, high, and hath very good Work|man&s;hip in it, wherefore the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Monks &s;hew it in&s;tead of the Gate of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple, before which lay the Man that was lame from his Mother's Womb, that begged Alms from <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> to whom <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid: <HI>Silver and gold I have none, but &s;uch as I have give I thee: In the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t of Nazareth, ri&s;e up and walk.</HI></P>
<P>At the end of the Gate of this Yard, as commonly in all their Church Porches, hung &s;ome Lamps. I could have willingly gone in before them, to &s;ee the Rock and Fountain, whereof <HI>Ezek.</HI> in his Forty &s;eventh Chapter maketh mention, together with the inward Building, but becau&s;e according to their <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Laws, all tho&s;e that are not circumci&s;ed are accounted to be unclean, therefore going into their Churches is forbid to <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> if any one is catch'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ithin, he is in danger of his life, or el&s;e he mu&s;t deny his Faith, and be made a <HI>Mamaluck</HI> or <HI>Renegado.</HI></P>
<P>In this Court-Yard is &s;till another Gate, called the <HI>Golden Gate</HI> by the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> but becau&s;e it &s;tands ju&s;t over again&s;t the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> therefore it is to be taken to be the Gate <HI>Sur,</HI> or rather, as <HI>Nehemias</HI> ch. iii. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xlvii. and 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxxi. &s;ay; For the Gate of the Stairs, which <HI>Semaia,</HI> the Son of <HI>Sahamia,</HI> the Keeper of them did build: through which our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did go into the Temple on Palm-Day, to drive out the Buyers and Sellers. Now altho this is walled up in the New Town Wall, &s;o that you cannot go ei|ther out or in; yet con&s;idering its ancient Arches, it looketh rather like a Church than a Town-Gate.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Yard &s;tands a <HI>Turki&s;h Mo&s;che,</HI> or Temple, called the Rock: this is e&s;teemed very much by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and next to tho&s;e of <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina</HI> reputed to be the mo&s;t holy. Becau&s;e God Almighty hath wrought many great Miracles there: and that there <HI>Mahomet</HI> (as they fal&s;ly write of him in their Books) called by God to be the la&s;t and greate&s;t Prophet, did ride from <HI>Mecha</HI> to that of the holy Rock of the Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which is Forty

They al&s;o certainly believe (chiefly the&s;e that live at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> as the Pilgrims know) that on the la&s;t day their <HI>Mahomet</HI> is to come and &s;eat him|&s;elf on the Rock of the Temple of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ria,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on the other &s;ide of the Valley of <HI>Jo&s;aphat</HI> on the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> over again&s;t him.

in great Caravans from all places, moved thereunto by the great Zeal they have towards their <HI>Mahomet</HI>: but chiefly the&s;e Pilgrims that have been at <HI>Madina-Talnabi,</HI> and <HI>Mecha,</HI> that is Three Days Jour|ney farther, who return by the way of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> (which is now by them caled <HI>Chutz</HI>) to &s;ay al&s;o their Prayers there: and are of opinion, that if they &s;hould do otherwi&s;e, than to come thither, their Peregrination would not be acceptable to God. Among&s;t the&s;e are a good many Renegado <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that go with them to <HI>Mecha,</HI> to get by their Devotion into greater preferment, and Wealth, wherefore they are e&s;teemed by them as holy and creditable ones (altho they are full of Kna|very and Roguery) as the&s;e that come from <HI>Maho|mets</HI> own Blood: they keep them very honorably, and pray for them as their Victors, and endue them with great great and peculiar Privileges, &s;o that their &s;ingle Witne&s;s is as valueable as three, four, &s;ix, ten of o|thers, according as they have been oftener in the&s;e pla|ces. And that every body may know them, they put upon their Turbans on their Heads, their <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s green Colours, as tho&s;e of their Prie&s;ts do, which e&s;teem them&s;elves to be his Relations, which are only permit|ted (as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> wear their red Colour) to wear &s;uch Turbants. Wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> believe it to be a &s;in to cover tho&s;e Members, which Nature hath made &s;ecret, with that Colour which their Prophet did bear on his Head. When the before-mentioned Renegado-<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>; are come to this degree, they are bought by every Body for Money, to bear witne&s;s before the <HI>Cady,</HI> or any other <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Magi&s;trate, and that even in Cau&s;es whereof they have not the lea&s;t knowledge. So it happens daily, that tho&s;e that give larger Bribes to the Magi&s;trate, and do exceed their Adver&s;aries in number of Witne&s;&s;es, make their lo&s;t and foul cau&s;e good: and of this they make no Con&s;cience, becau&s;e their <HI>Alcoran</HI> teacheth them, that God doth not impute to them perjury, but only if they do not invoke him: &s;o that it is full Satisfaction, if they feed ten poor ones for this Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, or if they cloath them, or if they redeem one pri&s;oner: but if they are not &s;ub|&s;tantial

enough to do this, they fa&s;t for it three times. This is of a very ill con&s;equence, becau&s;e they are not afraid to be Perjured and to cheat others. And although the&s;e and other the like Sins, are very common among&s;t the <HI>Turks, Viz.</HI> Robbing, and to break their Faith, &amp;c. (which are directly again&s;t God) yet for all that the&s;e (becau&s;e they have lo&s;t all remembrance of Confe&s;&s;ion, Penitence or mending of their Lives) exceed them in this by far.

In this they are very like unto the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI> (which in former Ages were &s;ubject unto the <HI>Soldans</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and did live on the &s;outh &s;ide of Mount <HI>Libanus</HI>) which, as Defenders and Protectors of their own Religion, were &s;et out before other <HI>Saracens,</HI> to Murder and Kill clande&s;tinly all tho&s;e that did op|po&s;e their <HI>Mahometan</HI> Laws and Religion.

chiefe&s;t to be; Alms, Pilgrimage, Fa&s;tings, to make Offerings, to ab&s;tain from certain Food or Drinks, frequent Wa&s;hing, Praying, upon which two la&s;t they look mo&s;t of all, as the true means, by which (if they keep them diligently) they may be freed and ab&s;olved from their Sins, according to the Promi&s;es of their dear Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Such and the like have al&s;o the <HI>Jews</HI> had in the Old Te&s;tament, where without doubt their Prophet (being by his Mother an <HI>I&s;hmae|lite</HI>) had them al&s;o. But &s;eeing that he al&s;o Attribu|teth to the&s;e Ab&s;olution and Satisfaction for our Sins, and al&s;o con&s;equently Salvation and everla&s;ting Life: Therefore all tho&s;e that follow and believe his Do|ctrine, mi&s;s the only Mediator and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> (of whom as well as of his Holy Word, they el&s;e have a good Opinion, as appeareth by their <HI>Alcoran</HI>) in whom God the Father Almighty will only be known, Invoked, and Adored.

So he denieth the Deity of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and E&s;teem|eth him to be no more (as <HI>Arius</HI> doth) then a great Saint, and meer Man.

And although the <HI>Turks</HI> prefer their <HI>Mahomet</HI> be|fore <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and al&s;o do not believe right neither of his E&s;&s;ence nor of his per&s;on, &s;o that therefore all their Wor&s;hip, with what Devotion &s;oever performed, is null and in vain, becau&s;e it is not in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: Yet for all that they Prai&s;e and E&s;teem <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> very high, and Extol him far beyond any Man, as one that was conceived by the Holy Gho&s;t, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and that hath here on Earth carried on his Doctrine, and confirmed it with powerful Miracles. Wherefore they E&s;teem the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the other Writings of the Prophets, but chiefly the Four Evangeli&s;ts, which they call the Book <HI>Jugilis</HI> (and the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es Thre&s;it</HI>) as true and Godly. And &s;ometimes they pretend &s;o fairly, that an ordinary Man that is not well in&s;tructed in the Chief Articles of Chri&s;tianity, although there is &s;o great a diffe|rence, might ea&s;ily be &s;educed, and per&s;waded. Be|&s;ides the <HI>Turks</HI> will not allow, neither to <HI>Jews, Moors,</HI> nor <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> nay not to their own Nation, to &s;ay any thing ill of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nor to Cur&s;e him, but if any body &s;hould pre&s;ume to do it, the &s;oles of his Feet are &s;truck very &s;everely with many blows, and he is Fined be&s;ides ac|cording to his Ability. So their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> com|mends

<P>If they would but often look into it (as their <HI>Alco|can</HI> teacheth them in &s;everal places) to read in it, and mend their Lives according to it, they might ea&s;ily be brought to the right way again; but he him&s;elf doth not &s;tand by his words, but falleth off again from them afterwards, and &s;peaketh quite otherways of the holy Scripture, and that &s;o differing, that he quite contra|dicts him&s;elf. For as he did commend it before, &s;o now he di&s;commendeth it again, when he &s;aith, That it hath been (becau&s;e it is too difficult to be kept) long &s;ince quite out of Doors, chiefly in tho&s;e parts where is written, That we mu&s;t do good to our Enemies; leave all for his &s;ake; love God with all our heart, &amp;c. and our Neighbor as our own &s;elf. And that therefore he <HI>Mahomet,</HI> was peculiarly and purpo&s;ely cho&s;en by God Almighty, to bring down with him the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and communicate it to the World (that was then drown'd in Lu&s;ts, Sin and Vices) to reform and bring it to rights again. Be&s;ides this he knew very well how to di&s;gui&s;e his Tricks, and how to behave him&s;elf in his Life and Conver&s;ation, devoutly and di&s;creetly to|wards the People, and how to blind them under this pretence, that they did believe him, and receive him the &s;ooner to be a great Prophet and Me&s;&s;enger from God. When he found that he had got a good Party, and a great many Adherents, that impowered him, he Studied daily more and more, to order his Laws &s;o, that they might be acceptable and plea&s;ing to all the World. And thus he got in a great many places &s;uch a fame, that, to our Grief, in the&s;e times, he hath &s;e|duced and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great part of the World with his Erroneous and Poi&s;onous Doctrine, the <HI>Turks</HI> clo&s;e|ly adhering to this Doctrine, therefore their Hearts are &s;o blinded with darkne&s;s, that they cannot have any true knowledge either of God the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Gho&s;t, and &s;o they mi&s;s of the right way that would bring them to the Knowledge, and Acknow|ledgment of their Sins, and con&s;equently to the Re|mi&s;&s;ion thereof, and &s;o make them Children of God,

and Heirs of Life Everla&s;ting. But on the contrary, they remain Impenitent, and per&s;i&s;t in their &s;inful Life, with &s;uch a Confidence and Security, that they know not when they commit Sins; as to take a Mans Pro|perty and Goods away by force; to de&s;troy his Hou&s;e and Lands; to undermine his Life and Livelihood; and al&s;o, to contaminate them&s;elves with Uncleanne&s;s, Whoredom, Sodomy: Not to keep an Oath that hath been taken; to Revenge them&s;elves; from whence Re|&s;ults, Envy, Hatred, Anger, Contention, Murder, &amp;c. as we hear, what Inju&s;tice and Violence the <HI>Grand Sig|nior</HI> committeth daily upon our Brethren and Si&s;ters, that border upon his Dominions; which we need not to wonder at, becau&s;e, if they fall out among&s;t them&s;elves, they try all Unju&s;t means to Revenge them&s;elves. Wherefore they accu&s;e their Adver&s;aries often fal&s;ely (becau&s;e they dare not offer any violence) before their Judges, and &s;o bring them to Damage, Trouble and Pains. But when they have committed one of the&s;e, or the like Facts, and have a mind to free them&s;elves of it, or to be Ab&s;olved, they go after their own invented Devotion, to good Works, Alms, Prayers, Fa&s;ting, Redeeming of Captives, &amp;c. to make &s;atisfaction to God for their committed Sins, as their <HI>Alcoran</HI> teacheth them. And &s;o they lead a Life of good outward Conver&s;ation, and are very diligent in their Devotion, chiefly in going to their Prayers at the five Cu&s;tomary hours of the Day, when they leave their VVork, and go to Church. And &s;eeing that in the&s;e Countries they have neither Clocks not VVatches, to tell them the time of the Day and Prayers, in&s;tead of them they have their Prie&s;ts (called <HI>Meitzen</HI> by them) on the Steeples, which are ordered to cry out the Hours with a loud Voice, that you may hear them as far almo&s;t as the Ringing of a Bell, even throughout the whole Town. The fir&s;t Hour of Prayers is an Hour and half before Day-light: The &s;econd is about Noon: The third (which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Latzera</HI>) is about Three a Clock in the Afternoon: The fourth is at Sun-&s;et; and the fifth when after the Sun is down, the Twilight or whiti&s;hne&s;s of the Skies is

gone, and the Stars appear clearly. Sometimes two of the&s;e Prie&s;ts &s;ing together, which is common in great Towns, and they &s;ing almo&s;t as with us they &s;ing a Ballad, &s;o that while the one is &s;inging, the other may fetch his breath; and &s;o they &s;ing by turns, until the Song is at an end. When I came fir&s;t into the&s;e Countries, and hear'd them Sing about that time in the Morning, I believed the <HI>Turks</HI> did it that they might brisk them&s;elves up to go to Work, until I heard them do the &s;ame at other hours in the day time, and under&s;tood they were their Prie&s;ts. So they Sing about Five a Clock at Night very well, and &s;ome|times &s;omething longer, becau&s;e of the Sick that live near, which de&s;ire it of them, to make them cheerful, and to have a good heart, which we need not to won|der at, for their Clergy (which are not Wi&s;er or more Learned than the Lay-men) know not how to com|fort them, or to make them joyful, much le&s;s how to give good and whol&s;ome In&s;truction, out of the Word of God (although they believe it to be true) how to obtain forgivene&s;s of Sin, and Gods Mercy, Love, or Commi&s;eration, but think it to be &s;ufficient, if they Admoni&s;h them that lye a dying, to think of God, and to Pray to him that he may have Mercy upon them; and afterwards to wa&s;h their Body to clean&s;e them quite from all Sins, according to the Law of their <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which they highly e&s;teem, and that the ra|ther, becau&s;e they &s;erve not only the Living but al|&s;o the Dead; wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> wa&s;h them&s;elves daily, chiefly at the Hours of their Prayer, when they are a going to Church, and that very carefully and diligently, <HI>viz.</HI> Their Hands, Privy-Members, Head, Neck, Feet, nay the whole Body, according as they are Contaminated or become Unclean. So in con&s;i|deration of their Sins, they have three &s;orts of wa&s;h|ing; whereof one is that of the whole Body, which the&s;e mu&s;t make u&s;e of that are not Married, and con|taminate them&s;elves with Concubines; wherefore the Baths are kept continually in an equal heat, and are open to any body both by Day and Night, that the&s;e that have occa&s;ion to wa&s;h their whole Body, may not

be hindered in their Devotion, but &s;oon go to Church again. The &s;econd is performed on the Organs of the five Sen&s;es, and the Head, to clean&s;e them from all &s;pots and blemi&s;hes, which are contracted by ill thought, and frivolous and un&s;eemly di&s;cour&s;es; wherefore there are &s;everal Ci&s;terns here and there, but chiefly in their Churches and Chapels, where they wa&s;h them|&s;elves fir&s;t, that being clean, they may be worthy to come to Church to Prayers, for if they &s;hould omit it, they believe that their Prayers would not be accepta|ble to God, and &s;o he would not hear them. So they begin fir&s;t with wa&s;hing of their Hands, then they lift up the Water with the hollow of their Hands, and &s;o let it run down to their Elbow; then they wa&s;h their Mouth, No&s;e, Eyes, Ears, Head, Neck, and at la&s;t their Feet, and &s;peak &s;ome peculiar words with it. When they have no Water, which often happeneth in large De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> they are allowed by their Laws in&s;tead thereof, to rub the&s;e Members over with Sand. But that they may not be hindered by their Cloaths, from coming to the&s;e Members, they wear &s;uch ones that have wide Sleeves, no gatherings about their Neck, nor have any Strings about their Drawers. The third &s;ort is al&s;o e&s;teemed to be very nece&s;&s;ary, and is made u&s;e of as often as they empty their Body by Stool or Urine, or Belching, and &s;o they wa&s;h them|&s;elves cowring down before the Ci&s;terns, publickly without &s;hame, both before and behind, in the &s;ight of every Body. According to what hath been &s;aid, we &s;ee that they mind only the outward clean&s;ing of their Body, and &s;o they look al&s;o upon the outward Cir|cumci&s;ion, rather than to think how they ought, ac|cording to Gods Commands, to clean&s;e them&s;elves from their inward Lepro&s;ie, by the Bath of Regene|ration, and to Circumci&s;e their Hearts, by an inward Spiritual Circumci&s;ion, whereof they know nothing. When their Clergy-men have cried out the Hours, from the Steeples to the <HI>Batzars,</HI> or <HI>Exchanges,</HI> &amp;c. and the <HI>Turks</HI> have wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed them&s;elves, they go into their Chapels, which are in the middle of their great <HI>Camps,</HI> or <HI>Carvat&s;chars,</HI> where I could &s;ee it

be&s;t, becau&s;e I dur&s;t not go into their <HI>Mo&s;ques.</HI> After they have left their Shoes at the Gate, they do not turn, nor look back for one another to &s;peak, but go &s;traight forwards, until they come to their places where they &s;tand &s;till, and look upon their Prie&s;t that is before them, and mind him, when he beginneth the Prayers, that they may &s;ay it after him, and imitate his Ceremo|nies or means, whereof he maketh u&s;e, as the lifting up his Hands, &s;troking over his Forehead, bending his whole Body forwards, falling down upon his Knees, ki&s;&s;ing the Earth; and at length when the <HI>Leila hillalla</HI> beginneth, turning their Heads from one &s;ide to the other, whereby they give a hint, That they are in Peace, and good Will with God and their Neighbors. While they are in their Holy Places, you &s;hall hear none of them Sneeze, Cough, Hawk or Spit, for they are of Opinion, that, if they &s;hould do &s;o, God would not hear their Prayers &s;o effectually, becau&s;e they &s;hould not be perfectly clean. They have no &s;et Form of their Prayers, and Pray generally for good Fortune, and other Worldly welfare; for Victory for their Em|peror; that God may &s;end great Divi&s;ions among&s;t us <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that &s;o they may have a better opportunity to fall upon us, and to beat us. They &s;uffer no Ima|ges in their Temples or Chapels, and are only for Ado|ring the true and only God, Creator of Heaven and Earth; and &s;o in&s;tead of them they have Pictures of &s;ine Plants or Flowers, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Ro&s;es, &amp;c. and Wri|tings of their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI>; and &s;o you find on their Gold and Silver Coins, no Pictures or Images of their Emperors, as upon ours, but only the Names of them, or of the Towns where they are Stamped, in <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters, (which are common to both Nations) together with the date of the Year, which they begin from the time when <HI>Mahomet</HI> fled into the De&s;arts, which for that rea&s;on they call the Year of <HI>Hegira,</HI> where he got a great number of Adherents, and was made by them a King; this was done in the Year of Chri&s;t 622. After they have ended their Prayers, they begin to talk to one another, and &s;o every one of them goeth home to VVork again; and they are allowed on their
<PB N="309" REF="162">
Fea&s;t-days (which they keep on <HI>Friday,</HI> as we do on <HI>Sunday,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI>) to open their Shops again after Prayers, and to go to VVork, becau&s;e they &s;ay that Idlene&s;s may the ea&s;ier draw them into Sins. So one may ea&s;ily know by their Shops, according as they are opened or &s;hut up on the&s;e three days, whe|ther they belong to <HI>Chri&s;tians, Turks,</HI> or <HI>Jews</HI>; be&s;ides none of the&s;e forceth one to ob&s;erve the others Holy-days, and &s;o they live peaceably and quietly together. Before the <HI>Turks</HI> Holy-day beginneth, they lighten on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Night before, as &s;oon as it beginneth to be dark, upon their high Steeples, many Lamps, whereof they hang without on the Galleries round about, three rows one above the other, &s;o that as you look upon them in the Night, they look like unto a threefold Garland; they let them burn &s;o long until they go out of them&s;elves one after the other. The &s;ame Lamps they al&s;o light every Night during their <HI>Lent,</HI> which beginneth in their Month <HI>Romadan</HI> (&s;o called by the <HI>Arabians</HI>) and doth la&s;t all that Month long. Their Year con&s;i&s;teth of Twelve Months, which they Accompt by the Moon-lights; &s;o that their Months do not agree with ours, (for theirs have not one with the other above 29 or 30 days) and con&s;equently their Years want between 10 or 11 days of ours, &s;o that their <HI>Lent</HI> falleth at an uncertain time, &s;ometimes in the Spring, and &s;ometimes in the Summer, &amp;c. &s;o in my time it began in <HI>December,</HI> and ended in <HI>January.</HI> During all this time they are very Devout, and &s;trive to be at the Prayers and Duties; for if any body &s;hould Dye in <HI>Lent</HI> time, that had u&s;ed not to fre|quent them, they would look upon him as a lo&s;t and damned Man, and doubt whether they &s;hould Bury him or no. During their <HI>Lent</HI> they Eat nothing before Night; when the Stars appear, then every one goeth home to Eat, or el&s;e in the great <HI>Batzars</HI> to a Cooks Shop, to buy Victuals, where all Night long is &s;o great a throng of poor People, that have nothing to Eat at home, that they lift one another almo&s;t up; there you &s;ee one Eating, another Drinking, another Crying out, others Quarrelling, which cau&s;eth &s;uch a

Crowd and Noi&s;e, as is enough to make one Deaf and Giddy. When <HI>Lent</HI> is at an end, then they begin their <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-Fea&s;t (which they call <HI>&V;lubaira</HI>) which they keep with great Solemnity for three days, &s;alute one another very kindly, and wi&s;h one the other all health and happine&s;s, as we do on <HI>New-years-Day</HI>: They al&s;o &s;eek all &s;orts of Pa&s;time, chiefly the <HI>Janizaries,</HI> which in great places erect Gibbets three Fathoms high, to the top whereof they tye &s;trong Ropes, almo&s;t like as the Children do in our Country, where they Swing others for a &s;mall recompence; when any body &s;its in it, two &s;tand ready with a broad String, one on each &s;ide, which they fling before him, and fling him back|wards with it, and &s;o &s;et him a Swinging. Others run before the People that are walking, and &s;prinkle them with &s;weet &s;melling Water, to get a little &s;pell of Money out of them, chiefly the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which they will not ea&s;ily leave before they have &s;atisfied them; wherefore they are nece&s;&s;itated to &s;tay at home on the&s;e days. Not long after they keep another pe|culiar Fea&s;t, called <HI>Chairbairam,</HI> where they al&s;o u&s;e all &s;orts of Ge&s;ticulations, which were too long to re|late here; they do not Fa&s;t on tho&s;e days, but they Sacrifice young Steers and Wethers, &amp;c. cut them in|to &s;mall pieces, to di&s;tribute them among the People, for the Honor of <HI>Abraham,</HI> becau&s;e he did obey God, and would have Sacrified his Son <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to him: At this abundance of Heathens congregate them&s;elves in cer|tain places before the Towns, to go in Pilgrimage to <HI>Medina-Talnabi, Mecha,</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for love to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Among&s;t them many are found, that are re|covered again from dangerous Di&s;tempers, or deli|vered from great Dangers, and then did make a Vow, either to go on Pilgrimage to one of the&s;e places, or el&s;e to kill &s;uch a number of Bea&s;ts to di&s;tribute among the Poor as an Alms.</P>
<P>According to what I have &s;aid before, that they compute their Months more by the Moon-light, and &s;o accompt Twelve of them to a Year, they ob&s;erve mightily the Change of the Moon, chiefly the New Moon, to &s;ee it again. Wherefore at that time they
<PB N="311" REF="163">
go often in great Numbers out, unto the next Hill, to ob&s;erve it the better, after Sun &s;et. He that &s;eeth it fir&s;t &s;heweth it with great rejoycing to his Companions. In their Progno&s;tications they al&s;o mind the Moons Light and according to that, they make their Accompt, to know then if any thing &s;hall happen. They have al&s;o (as &s;ome of them have told me) a peculiar Book, which they keep very clo&s;e to them&s;elves, wherein is briefly Written, what &s;hall happen to them every year, whether it be good or bad: This beginneth in the &s;ame Year, with their Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and continu|eth for 1000 Year, when this is at an End, they have nothing more of that Nature worth any thing.</P>
<P>And being they go no further, &s;ome will deduce or conclude from thence, that their Reign will &s;oon have an end, when tho&s;e years are pa&s;&s;ed. Wherefore they fear the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> very much, and confe&s;s them&s;elves, that they expect to &s;uffer a great blow from the <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI>: And this one may &s;ee or conclude, from hence for on their Holidays in the Morning about 9 of the Clock, they &s;hut up the Gates of their Towns, great Champs, and other publick Habitations, as I found at <HI>A|leppo,</HI> &s;o that many times I could not get either out or in until they opened them again, for they fear at that time to be A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>Being then that their Term of Years is near expired, for when I lived in the&s;e Places in the year 1575. they Writ 982 of this &s;ame Term, &s;o that there was not quite 18 Years more to come. Now if we com|pare the&s;e 1000 Years with tho&s;e whereof <HI>John</HI> the E|vangeli&s;t and Apo&s;tle maketh mention in the 20th <HI>Chapt.</HI> and 7th <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> of his <HI>Revelation,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>When the</HI> 1000 <HI>Years are expired Satan &s;hall be loo&s;ed out of his Pri&s;on.

We find not only that they may al&s;o be interpreted and ap|plied to the <HI>Turks</HI> and their Adherents, but al&s;o that they

have begun their Reign almo&s;t at the &s;ame time when <HI>Mahomet</HI> and the <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> &s;hould appear, about the year 666 as we Read in the 13th Chapter and the la&s;t Ver&s;e of St. <HI>John</HI> in his <HI>Revelation.</HI> And be&s;ides it look|eth in the&s;e mi&s;erable times (when it &s;eems as if every thing would turn top&s;ie turvy) that the&s;e Years are pa&s;&s;ed, and that Satan is loo&s;ed, as if our dear Lord God would make an End of this malicious World. Add that &s;ome Learned Mathematicians do Progno&s;ticate that at the&s;e times, but chiefly in the year 1588. great Alterations will be in all the parts of the World.

This Arch is open at the Top in the Middle, and hath two other &s;mall Arches about the widne&s;s of an ordinary door one by the other &s;upported by a Marble Column, in one of them &s;tood <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with his Crown of Thorns on, and <HI>Pontius Pilat</HI> in the other, when he &s;aid to the People, <HI>Behold the Man.</HI></P>
<P>Hard by at the other &s;ide of the Arch, at the Right Hand, on an A&s;cent, they &s;hew the Habitation of King <HI>Herod,</HI> which is &s;till very fine, and gloriou&s;ly built of Marble. Wherefore, although it is not the &s;ame (which hath been burnt long agone by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and afterwards Rooted out by the <HI>Romans</HI>) yet it is built in the &s;ame Place, where the King's Palace did &s;tand, on the height of Mount <HI>Bethzetha,</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> Te&s;tifieth, from the North over again&s;t the <HI>Temple,</HI> and the Fort <HI>Antonia</HI>: Where our dear Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was Mocked and Abu&s;ed by <HI>Herod</HI> and his Servants, and had a White Garment put upon him, and &s;o was &s;ent back again to <HI>Pilate.</HI> In the&s;e Habitations, chiefly the&s;e of <HI>Pilate,</HI> are &s;till to this day, <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Magi&s;trates <HI>(Sanchiachs, Cadis, and Souba&s;haws)</HI> dwelling, that keep Courts of Judicature there; and therefore no body is admitted to come in, before he hath Gratified the Ma&s;ter and Servants.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Mount</HI> Calvaria&punc; <HI>and the Holy Grave of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 27th of <HI>Septemb.</HI> in the year 1575 after Din|ner, the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> did &s;end to the other Lords of the Temple, to let us in to the Temple of Mount <HI>Calvaria</HI> (which the <HI>Turks</HI> keep always Locked up.) But we and &s;ome other Friers in their own Habit, went with their Father <HI>Guardian</HI> to the Temple of the Mount, which fir&s;t of all the Pious Queen <HI>Hellen</HI> Mo|ther of the Great Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> (after &s;he had de&s;troyed the Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> that was Built upon the Place of the Grave) did Build, as &s;he did al&s;o build &s;e|veral Churches in &s;everal Places, <HI>Viz.</HI> That at <HI>Bethle|hem,</HI> where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was Born: That of the Holy Apo|&s;tle <HI>James</HI> the greater, in the Place of the Upper Town, where he was Beheaded: And an other on the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did A&s;cend into Heaven: As al&s;o another at <HI>Bethania,</HI> where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did Rai&s;e <HI>Laza|rus</HI> his dear Friend, from the Dead, and in many other places, at <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and on the Mount <HI>Thabor,</HI> &amp;c. But when afterward the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was many times Be&s;ieged, and at length taken from the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> by the unbelieving <HI>Saracens, Hequen</HI> that malicious King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> did in the year of Chri&s;t 1011. Demoli&s;h the&s;e Churches, and &s;o they remained until after his Decea&s;e his Son <HI>Daber</HI> came to the Government, who afterwards in the year 37. did give leave to <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Empe|ror of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> (when he renewed with him their Old Corre&s;pondency) to Rebuild it again at his own Co&s;t and Charges. In the&s;e our times, when it remain|eth in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> free Egre&s;s and Re|gre&s;s, is quite denied to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Pilgrims,</HI> that come to &s;ee the Holy Places: For when they &s;aw that many <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> came yearly thither from all Places, <HI>Viz.</HI> From <HI>Armenia, Aethiopia, Syria, Aegypt, Greece,
<PB N="316" REF="166">
Italy,</HI> Nay from all Places of <HI>Europe,</HI> they have put a cer|tain Sum of Mony (according as they are near, or fur|ther off, under his Dominions or not) to be paid by them, to be admitted. For &s;ome pay two or three Seckins or Ducats, other four and five; but we that are Outlandi&s;h, as <HI>Italians, French-men,</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> (as well knowing that we do not &s;pare for Mony) mu&s;t pay Nine Seckins a piece, and that without any Re|mi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be paid in weighty <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Venetian</HI> Ducats: And they keep the Temple Locked up clo&s;e, until every one of them have paid their due: By the&s;e means the <HI>Grand Senior</HI> hath acquired him&s;elf a con&s;ide|rable yearly Revenue, which amounts to &s;everal thou|&s;and Ducats yearly. But yet it is now adays nothing near to what it hath been formerly, when all was under Popi&s;h Darkne&s;s, and the Pilgrims u&s;ed to Flock thither in great Numbers. For &s;ince in our time, by the Grace of God, the Holy Go&s;pel hath been brought to Light again, and began to be Preached (which &s;heweth us a far nearer and better way to find <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to have true and full Pardon and Remi&s;&s;ion of our Sins) &s;o that daily more come to the knowledge of the Truth, and return to the Lord, his Revenues decrea&s;e as much as the Number of the Pilgrims that u&s;ed to re&s;ort thi|ther.</P>
<P>When we came pretty near to the Temple, and ex|pected to have &s;een Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> told us, that this Mount, together with the holy Grave, and the Garden (wherein <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did fir&s;t appear unto <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>) were intirely taken into the Temple, &s;o that no heigth at all was to be &s;een without.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t when we came into the Court of the Temple there appeared an old Heatheni&s;h Pri&s;on, wherein are Pri&s;oners kept to this day, near which did &s;tand the <HI>Pri&s;on-Gate</HI> (whereof we &s;aw &s;till &s;ome part of the Wall up in the Wall of the Church) through which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did carry his Cro&s;s to the place of Sculls, which in former days was without the Town, as you may chiefly in St. <HI>Mark,</HI> Chap. 17. V. 20. clearly &s;ee, where he writes; <HI>And they led him out to crucifie him.</HI> And in the Thirteenth Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Ver&s;. 12.
<PB N="317" REF="166">
where it is plainly writ, that <HI>Chri&s;t &s;uffered without the Gate.</HI> But when afterwards the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> did rebuild and enlarge the de&s;olated Town, he did al&s;o &s;urround with a Wall the place where our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> did &s;uffer, which was without towards the North-We&s;t, beyond the Mount <HI>Moria,</HI> &s;o that now it is &s;ituated almo&s;t in the middle of the City of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> and becu&s;e of this Inlargement he call'd the Town after his Sirname <HI>Helia.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;taying a great while at the Gate, before they did open it unto us, &s;everal <HI>Oriental Chri&s;tians,</HI> to wit, <HI>Greeks, JACOBITES, Armenians,</HI> &amp;c. came to us to vi&s;it their Prie&s;ts, and to perform their Devotion in it, &s;o that about Three-&s;core went in with us.</P>
<P>The Building of the Temple is very large, of &s;trong Walls, and &s;o thick, that it taketh away the Light within: it is richly covered with Grey Marble within and without, and &s;upported by &s;ome Marble Pillars about a Fathom and a half thick, &s;o &s;trongly, that one may conclude from thence, that neither Labour nor Co&s;ts were &s;pared in its Building. Yet the <HI>Turks,</HI> (notwith&s;tanding the holy Places and the Co&s;tline&s;s of the Building) have in &s;ome places &s;poiled and demo|li&s;hed &s;ome part of the Walls thereof, &s;o that now they are no more like to the old ones that were before, and be&s;ides (as the <HI>Guardian</HI> told us) half of it is hardly remaining. Yet it is &s;till very large, and &s;o well clo|&s;ed up again, that one can hardly perceive the Lo&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>As we went through, we pa&s;&s;ed by the Grave of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in a glorious large Chapel, called our <HI>Ladies</HI> which the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> have in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is hung with Tape&s;try very well wrought. Within it is a great Altar, on each &s;ide whereof is to be &s;een a Nick, artificially made of white Marble, the Windows whereof are very well guarded with Iron Bars: in that towards the Left Hand is kept a piece of the Column whereon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was whip'd; it is of a red|di&s;h Colour, three &s;pans long, and four over. In the o|ther on the Right there is a &s;mall Crucifix, in the middle whereof is in-laid a &s;mall piece of the true Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="167">From thence we went further into their Ve&s;tiary; which hath &s;everal large Rooms, where we &s;taid until the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> had put on their u&s;ual Habits to go their Rounds with us, and to &s;hew us the holy places with the u&s;ual Ceremonies. When they had made them&s;elves ready we came out again into the Church, and left the Chancel of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> that is in the middle, and the holy Grave upon our Right Hand, and went to the Left to another Chapel, whereby the <HI>Grecians</HI> have an Altar without, by which in the Marble Floor, are two Holes to be &s;een, wherein they pretend that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was detained pri&s;oner until they had fixed the Cro&s;s for him on the place of the Sculls. This Chapel is within very deep, and &s;o dark, that when you go into it you believe that you go into a Cave, where the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> believe, as I under&s;tood by a <HI>French</HI> Man of their Convent, who was in a Prie&s;t's Habit, and as we went about, &s;tanding before the Altar, did tell us, what they had done to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, in eve|ry place; that they did detain <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> there (as in a place where into they threw the Du&s;t) to mock him, until his Cro&s;s was got ready for him.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t by the Chapel behind the Chancel, they &s;hew on a high Arch another place, where the Soldiers did &s;hare <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Cloaths among&s;t them, and ca&s;t Lots for his Coat.</P>
<P>Somewhat farther about they &s;hew a pair of Stairs of Twenty nine Steps, which we de&s;cended, and came into a great Chapel of Queen <HI>Helen,</HI> &s;ituated under|neath Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> wherein is &s;till towards the Right Hand of the Altar a glorious and beautiful high Seat of Marble whereon the Queen u&s;ed to &s;it, when &s;he had a mind to overlook the Workmen, to &s;ee whether they went on right; for &s;he loved Build|ing mightily, as appeareth &s;till to this day by the num|ber of her mighty Buildings. Behind this Seat are eleven Steps, which go further down Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> where the Ci&s;tern hath been, wherein Queen <HI>Helen</HI> found the Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Underneath on the Altar, 'tis true, there &s;tands one, but it is new, and therefore to be &s;uppo&s;ed, to be put
<PB N="319" REF="167">
there of late years. At the bottom of the Stairs do al&s;o appear very plainly the cracked Rocks, as it is mentioned in Scripture: <HI>And the rocks rent.</HI> And the&s;e Rents or Cracks are a foot wide, and &s;o deep as to reach from the top to the bottom of the rocky Mount of <HI>Calvaria.</HI></P>
<P>When we came up into the Church again, they &s;hewed us at the bottom of Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> a Chapel that was locked up, and in it underneath the Altar a large blacki&s;h Stone with &s;ome reddi&s;h Spots upon it, in the &s;hape of a piece of a Pillar, which was brought thither from <HI>Pilate</HI>'s Hou&s;e of Judicature, whereon our Lord did &s;it, when the Soldiers did put the Crown of Thorns on his holy Head, and did &s;alute him as a King with their Knees bended, and did al&s;o mock him, &s;pit in his Face, and whip him. This Crown was twi&s;ted out of Thorns, called by the <HI>Arabians, Nau&s;egi</HI> and <HI>Athau&s;egi</HI>; and by the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Latini&s;ts,</HI> which have kept the &s;ame Name, <HI>Rhamnus,</HI> whereof there are three &s;orts, the fir&s;t of which is the true one (which is al&s;o common in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>) which doth not only grow without, but al&s;o within the Town of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> plentifully; this puts out early in the Spring, into long, thin and pliable Twigs, with a great many long and &s;trong Prickles. Ju&s;t by it cometh out above from the Chancel of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> a path up to Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> which they forced from the <HI>Georgians,</HI> as they did before from the <HI>Armenians,</HI> by giving Money to the <HI>Turks.</HI> Which is very common in the&s;e Countries; for if one hath any Bu&s;ine&s;s to be done by the <HI>Turks,</HI> it cannot be ea&s;ier obtained, than if you bribe them more than your Adver&s;ary, wherefore it happeneth very often that &s;uch places are taken away from one Nation, and given to the other.</P>
<P>Underneath this Way or Gallery you a&s;cend nine|teen Steps to go up to Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> where we &s;aw two Chapels one behind the other, which were open, and had a very delicate Floor, artificially inlaid wirh Flowers of &s;everal Colours, the like whereof is hardly to be &s;een any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="168">At the top of the Stairs we left our Shooes, and went in, and attended the Prie&s;t, which did al&s;o there, as he had done in other places before, give us a &s;hort account of what had been done to our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in the&s;e places, <HI>viz.</HI> that in the hindmo&s;t Chapel his Hands and Feet had been extended, and &s;harp Nails drove through them, and &s;o with a great deal of Indignation he was fixed to the Cro&s;s. And that in the foremo&s;t our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did hang on the Cro&s;s be|tween the two Malefactors, where there was &s;till to be &s;een the Hole wherein the Cro&s;s of our Lord did &s;tand. He al&s;o briefly repeated to us the Seven Words which he did &s;ay when he was upon the Cro&s;s; and for a Conclu&s;ion he told us, that his Holine&s;s the Pope had laid there Indulgences for ever, for all Sins and Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, to be di&s;tributed among the Pilgrims.</P>
<P>When we had done we went further into the Cha|pel, and &s;aw fir&s;t a place two Cubits high, which was al&s;o covered with fine A&s;hen-coloured Marble, watered with Blew, in the middle whereof was a round Hole about a Span over, and was lined with Tin, wherein did &s;tand the Cro&s;s of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which is &s;o clo&s;ely tipped and lined, that the Pilgrims can take neither much nor little of this, nor any other place, as the holy Grave, or <HI>Bethlehem</HI> where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was born, &amp;c. Wherefore notwith&s;tanding the pretence of the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> that in their <HI>Agnus Dei's</HI> and Crucifixes are little pieces of the fore-mentioned places, it is all fal&s;e and nothing of Truth in it, which they mu&s;t confe&s;s them&s;elves, it being all covered with Marble. Near to this Hole, both to the Right and Left, where the Cro&s;&s;es of the Two Thieves did &s;tand, in the Room of them two others are erected, where hard by that on the Left at the in&s;ide, is to be &s;een a long and large Fi&s;&s;ure in the Rock of the Mount, which the Queen left on purpo&s;e open in the Marble Pavement, &s;o that you may very plainly &s;ee it, and it goeth down very deep, as I have told you before.</P>
<P>When we come down again from the Mount, and come out behind the Chancel toward the Gate of the great Church, there lieth in the Pavement a fine and
<PB N="321" REF="168">
large Marble, which is &s;urrounded, or taken in, with Iron Barrs in the &s;ame place, where <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Nico|demus,</HI> the Two Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> did wrap up the Body of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> after it was taken down, in Linnen with Spices.</P>
<P>From thence as we went further towards the Grave of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we left below towards the Left on the place of a Scull, another Chapel, wherein are the Graves of &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Kings, <HI>viz. Gottofredi,</HI> and <HI>Baldewin,</HI> &amp;c. which took the Land of Promi&s;e by force from the Infidels, and came towards the Right by the Chancel of the <HI>Greeks</HI> into a great round and high Building of the holy Grave, which butts upon the Church, and is below towards it, it &s;tanding upon very &s;trong double Marble Pillars, quite open: it is covered with Lead, and hath at the top a great Window, where the Light falleth in, which is four Fathoms &s;quare, where underneath is the holy Grave of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> under the open Sky, &s;o that at all times, both Rain, Dew and Snow fall upon it.</P>
<P>Before the Pa&s;&s;age into the Sepulchre is a &s;mall Cha|pel, wherein is nothing of any moment to be &s;een, than a Square Stone, ju&s;t before the Door of the Grave; this is of the true Rock of the Grave, about eight Inches thick, whereon (as &s;ome &s;ay) the Angel of the Lord, that rolled back the Stone from the Door, did &s;it. This was al&s;o u&s;eful and did &s;erve to keep the great Grave-Stone, that was before the Door of the Grave (which is hardly three Foot high) &s;teady, that it might not give backwards. That the Door was but low, and that the Stone did lean before it, you may &s;ufficiently &s;ee out of the Twenty fourth Chapter of the holy E|vangeli&s;t S. <HI>Luke,</HI> Ver&s;e 12. when he &s;aith: <HI>Then aro&s;e Peter, and ran unto the &s;epulchre, and &s;tooping down,</HI> &amp;c. And al&s;o in the Twentieth Chapter, and the Eleventh Ver&s;e of St. <HI>John,</HI> where you read: <HI>But Mary &s;tood without at the &s;epulchre weeping: and as &s;he wep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;he &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oped down, and looked into the &s;epulchre.</HI> And al&s;o the holy Apo&s;tle and Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>John</HI> came before <HI>Peter</HI> to the Sepulchre, and looked into it, and &s;aw the Linnen Cloaths, but he did not go in him&s;elf. And we
<PB N="322" REF="169">
read al&s;o of the Door of the Sepulchre, and that the great Stone before it u&s;ed to be rolled. When you will go into the Door you mu&s;t &s;toop very much, and ra|ther creep than go into it. The Sepulchre within is even with the Floor of the Chapel, and of the whole Church, and is &s;o large, that four per&s;ons may &s;tand very ea&s;ily by one another.</P>
<P>After the Prie&s;t had ended his Speech which he made in the Sepulchre, of the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which we heard without in the Chapel, and had al&s;o pro|claimed the Popes Indulgences for ever, we went in al&s;o, and looked upon the Rock whereout the Sepul|chre was cut, and found it underneath on the Right Hand (altho it had been very much torn by the Infi|dels) &s;till in very good Order, &s;o that we could di|&s;cern it &s;till di&s;tinctly, where now the Monks have made an Altar, and covered it with a large fair Marble. Over it hung about Twenty Lamps, which made the Sepulchre (which el&s;e is very dark) very light; one whereof belongeth to the <HI>Catho|lick</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> another to the <HI>Christian</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and others to other Princes; they look very carefully after them, becau&s;e they bring them in a con&s;iderable Revenue yearly. The <HI>holy Sepulchre</HI> is lined within and without with grey Marble, and chiefly without &s;ome adorned with carved Columns that &s;tand between it.</P>
<P>On the out&s;ide of the Door of the Sepulchre doth hang a fine Golden Piece, wherein our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is very artificially wrought, as he did appear after his Re|&s;urrection unto <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> fir&s;t, and afterwards al&s;o to the Women: at the top of the Sepulchre is al&s;o a &s;mall round Steeple, which is covered with Lead, and upheld with &s;ix double Marble Columns: be&s;ides this there is at the Back of the Sepulchre another plain Chapel, wherein the <HI>JACOBITES,</HI> as I was in|formed, perform their Devotion.</P>
<P>More at the Left Hand, as we went out of the Se|pulchre again, near to it in the Pavement, are two large Circles, rarely inlaid of <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work, in the middle whereof are two round Stones of Marble, one

<P>When I found my &s;elf to be in the&s;e places where our dear Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did walk about, teach, and by his Pa&s;&s;ion, Death, Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion work our Redemption, and procure and purcha&s;e our Salvation, from his Heavenly Father again, I did remember and rejoice at the&s;e incomparable Benefits, and merciful Trea&s;ures with all my heart; for it cannot otherwi&s;e be, but that every true <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> that is upon this Mount of <HI>Calvary,</HI> and thinks there of the Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and in the Sepulchre of his glorious Re&s;ur|rection, mu&s;t find great Pa&s;&s;ions within his Brea&s;t: as you al&s;o read in the la&s;t Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> Ver&s;e 8. of the Women, where you find the&s;e Words: <HI>And they departed quickly from the &s;epulchre, with fear and great joy.</HI> This I found al&s;o in my Heart and Mind, &s;o that it was, as if I &s;aw our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Son of the Almighty God, to humble him&s;elf, and to be|come obedient to his Heavenly Father, even to Death, nay, to the Death of the Cro&s;s, to bring us mi&s;erable, &s;inful Men to Rights again, and to deliver us clearly from all Debts and Puni&s;hments, and &s;o to procure us the only and true Indulgences.</P>
<P>After we had &s;een Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> the Sepulchre of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord, and other places, we went into the Ve&s;tiary again to eat our Supper.</P>
<P>After Supper, they led us up into the Gallery (which is in the round Building over again&s;t the holy Sepul|chre) to &s;tay there all Night: but &s;ome of the Ea|&s;tern <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;ung below in the Church, others did grumble together, and played with their &s;weet &s;ound|ing Cymbals (which were made of pure Metal about the bigne&s;s of a large Walnut-&s;hell) &s;o plea&s;ant Tunes or Mu&s;ick, that I rather looked on them, and minded their Mu&s;ick, than &s;lept.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Year of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 1096, when <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth was Emperor of the We&s;t, and <HI>Alexius</HI> the <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperor at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in the Ea&s;t. Pope <HI>&V;rban</HI> the Second called a Council at <HI>Claremont</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where they con&s;ulted together which way the Land of Promi&s;e might be delivered again from the Hands of the Infidels. Where it was concluded and agreed upon, to take the Field in common, and for their General they cho&s;e <HI>Gottefrid de Boulion,</HI> Count of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nonia</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> Along with him went many Princes, Counts and Noblemen, <HI>viz. Baldwin</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tachius</HI> his Brethren, and many more, and brought together an Army of Six hundred thou&s;and Foot, and One hun|dred thou&s;and Hor&s;e: &s;o they went in &s;everal Parties through <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ria, Greece,</HI> &amp;c. till they had pa&s;&s;ed the Helle&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, and came into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s,</HI> (now called <HI>Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lia,</HI> and belonging to the <HI>Turks</HI>) where they joyn'd again, and took &s;ome Towns, to wit, <HI>Nicea, Tar&s;us,</HI>
<PB N="327" REF="171">
and al&s;o <HI>Antiochia</HI> &s;ituated in <HI>Caelo&s;yria.</HI> Yet in the&s;e Actions were a great many <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;lain by the way, others were taken Pri&s;oners, &s;ome were &s;tarved, a great many died of Sickne&s;&s;es, that came by changing of the Air in the&s;e hot Countries; &s;o that in three years time, for &s;o long dured this March, there were hardly Forty thou&s;and Men (as &s;ome write) left, of the afore|named Sum that did arrive in the Land of Promi&s;e. The&s;e went with their Ma&s;ter and General <HI>Gottefrid de Boulion</HI> before the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> wherein were a greater number of the Infidels, to defend it; yet they &s;urrounded the City, and took it in a little time, and killed a great number of them. When they had taken the Town on the 15th. Day of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1099, and had reduced it, they laid down their Armors and Arms, and went to vi&s;it the <HI>Holy Sepulchre</HI> with great Devotion, and cho&s;e there unanimou&s;ly their General King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who at their reque&s;t undertook the Government, would not be called King, nor Crowned with a Golden Crown in that place, where our Saviour that Arch-King had worn one of Thorns. After he had obtained this Victory, he al&s;o &s;ubdued &s;ome ad|jacent Towns, <HI>viz. Joppe</HI> called <HI>Ja&s;&s;a, Porphria</HI> &s;itua|ted at the Foot of Mount <HI>Carmel</HI> (by the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> called <HI>Hayphe</HI>) <HI>Tiberias</HI> and the Con&s;ines of <HI>Galilea.</HI> He al&s;o overcame with a handful of his Men, the Captain of the Sultan, who had a great number of Men with him, and killed above Thirty thou&s;and of them. But as nothing is la&s;ting in human Affairs, he died in the Eleventh Month of his Reign, and was buried in the above-mentioned Chapel, and upon his Tomb-Stone is &s;till to be read this following Epitaph.</P>

<P>After his Decea&s;e the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> unanimou&s;ly cho&s;e his Brother <HI>Baldewin</HI> King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in his place: He overcame with a &s;mall number of Men th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that was Two and twenty thou&s;and &s;trong, and

killed the greate&s;t part of his Men. And when he died in the Eighteenth Year of his Reign, they cho&s;e Cou&s;in <HI>Baldewin</HI> of <HI>Burgo,</HI> the Second of that Name, King. This was a great Warrior, and did many He|roick Deeds with few Men again&s;t the Heathens; he overcame and took Pri&s;oner <HI>Gatzim</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Prince of the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI> with a great number of Men; but &s;oon after in the Fifth Year of his Reign, he was beaten in a Battel by the King of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> and carried away Pri&s;oner. In the mean time, the <HI>Veneti|ans</HI> and <HI>Genoue&s;es</HI> came with Two hundred and &s;eventy Ships, and di&s;per&s;ed and beat the <HI>Armada</HI> of the <HI>Sara|cens,</HI> and &s;unk many of their Ships, and took al&s;o the &s;trong Town of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> &s;o that both by Sea and Land there was abundance of Blood &s;hed. When the Ene|mies &s;aw this, that they &s;et the King at liberty again in the Eighteent Month of his Impri&s;onmenth, for a Sum of Money; after that he did execute in the &s;ix fol|lowing Years of his Reign, in order to an Enlarge|ment of his Kingdom, many glorious and famous Deeds. He overthrew the King of the <HI>A&s;calonites,</HI> who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and fell upon <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> in one &s;ingle Battel, and al&s;o beat the King of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> in three &s;everal ones, as you may &s;ee by his Epitaph here underneath written.</P>

<P>In the Year 1131, the Crown was pre&s;ented to <HI>Ful|con,</HI> Count of <HI>Andegavia,</HI> and Son-in-law to the be|fore-&s;aid <HI>Baldewin,</HI> who al&s;o obtained &s;everal Victories again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI> But in his time there aro&s;e &s;ome Differences among the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and &s;ome Con&s;piracies, which proved afterwards very di&s;advan|tageous to him, he lo&s;t al&s;o <HI>Ede&s;&s;a,</HI> a City in <HI>Me&s;opota|mia,</HI> which King <HI>Baldewin the Fir&s;t</HI> had conquered be|fore, which the <HI>Turks</HI> took by force from him.

King left two Sons <HI>Baldewin</HI> and <HI>Alamric,</HI> and after he had reigned Eleven Years, he fell dead when he hunted a Hare on full &s;peed. After him his Son <HI>Baldewin the Third</HI> was Crowned, who al&s;o died in the Twenty fourth Year of his Reign, after he had fought &s;everal Battels, and taken &s;ome Towns. Then his Brother <HI>Alamric</HI> came to the Crown, who was a great War|rior, &s;o that he was very fit for this Dignity, he ob|tained many Victories again&s;t Sultan <HI>Saladin.</HI> But afterwards when the Scales were turned, he died al&s;o after his return from <HI>Egypt</HI> in the Year 1178, his Son <HI>Baldewin the Fourth,</HI> and the Seventh King, un|dertook the Government of the Kingdom in the Thir|teenth Year of his Reign. This, although he was le|prous, yet he managed his Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, and de|fended his Dominions courageou&s;ly and gloriou&s;ly a|gain&s;t the Infidels. And becau&s;e he would not be mar|ried by rea&s;on of his Di&s;temper, therefore he married his Si&s;ter <HI>Sibylla</HI> to a Marquis of <HI>Monteferrato,</HI> called <HI>William.</HI> She was brought to Bed, in the fir&s;t year, of a Son, and called him after his Uncle <HI>Baldewin.</HI> But when <HI>William</HI> died, he married her again to <HI>Guido</HI> of <HI>Lu&s;ignan,</HI> Count of <HI>Joppe</HI>; with this condition, that after his Decea&s;e he &s;hould Rule the Kingdom for his Son-in-law, and be his Guardian &s;o long until he came at age. But he behaving him&s;elf very ill in the mean while, the King grew &s;o angry with him, that he would by no means &s;uffer him to live in his Domi|nions, and ordered another to fill up his place, one <HI>Raymond,</HI> a Count of <HI>Tripoli.</HI> Soon after the King died before his Son was quite Twenty Years old, and was al&s;o buried in the Temple of the holy Sepulchre. Within Eight Months after, did al&s;o die the true Heir of the Crown, the Son of <HI>Sibylla</HI> his Si&s;ter, and was al&s;o buried by the other Kings; &s;o that we find &s;till on three &s;everal Tomb-Stones that &s;tand clo&s;e one behind the other, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>So by the Incitation of his Mother, <HI>Guido</HI> was pro|claimed the la&s;t King.</P>
<P><HI>Raymund</HI> the Count of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> was extremely di&s;|gu&s;ted at this Election, being that the Kingdom was already recommended to him, wherefore he re&s;olved to go to war with him, and that he might be &s;trong e|nough for him, he made a League with Sultan <HI>Saladin,</HI> to his own Grief and Ruine. For when the Sultan &s;aw the&s;e Differences between them two, he rai&s;ed &s;uddenly a great Army, and took <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the whole Country by force of Arms. So the Kingdom of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> after the Chri&s;tians had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it Eighty eight Years, and Nineteen Days, was retaken a|gain by the Infidels, not without great Lo&s;s and Damage.</P>
<P>Not long after, the Infidels did pull down the Walls of the City, turned the Churches into Stables (&s;aving the Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI>) and &s;poiled the holy Sepulchre of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which in all the other Wars did &s;till remain intire, &s;o that only one &s;ide of the Rock thereof is now to be &s;een. This was done by the Infi|dels on purpo&s;e, to &s;hew us the fooli&s;h Zeal we have to conquer and vi&s;it the holy Grave and City, as if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> were &s;till in it.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Common Account of &s;everal &s;orts of</HI> Chri&s;ti|ans, <HI>but chiefly of them that are always to be found in the Temple of Mount</HI> Calva|ria: <HI>And al&s;o how the&s;e, and many other Strangers, are treated by the</HI> Turki&s;h <HI>Em|peror (as by their chief Head, to whom they generally are &s;ubjected) and his Officers.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Temple of Mount <HI>Calvaria</HI> live <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of &s;everal Nations; as <HI>Latins,</HI> or <HI>Italians, Aby&s;&s;ins, Graecians, Armenians, Georgians, Ne&s;torians, Syrians, Jacobites,</HI> &amp;c. which for the mo&s;t part are Prie&s;ts and Friers, which are of &s;o different Opinions in many Articles of Faith, that many of them might &s;ooner be reckon'd among&s;t the Super&s;titious and Hereticks than <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>; wherefore each of them have their pecu|liar Habitation and Chapel, that they may perform their Devotion undi&s;turbed by one another. The <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Emperor al&s;o lets them alone, and doth not at all trouble them for their Religion, nor endeavour to bring them over to the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion and <HI>Al|coran</HI>; and is very well contented to receive his Yearly Tribute, which is exactly demanded as it cometh to be due. I have &s;een many of them in the Temple, to go up and down in their peculiar Habit, and once I did attend at their Devotion, &s;o that I ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed away the time, that the <HI>Turks</HI> kept us Locked up in it.</P>
<P>Their Pilgrims re&s;ort thither Yearly, chiefly again&s;t the great Fea&s;ts or Holy Days, in great Numbers, to &s;ee the holy Places, not only from the Ea&s;tern, but al&s;o from the We&s;tern Countries: The&s;e that are under the &s;ubjection of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> which they are almo&s;t all of them (except the <HI>Latins</HI> and <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI>) mu&s;t pay him Yearly the fourth part of all their Revenues: He that

So in their Harve&s;t, every fourth Sheaf is al&s;o his; their Harve&s;t beginneth in the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> and endeth in <HI>May,</HI> as you may &s;ee, <HI>Deut.</HI> chap. 16. ver&s;. 9. <HI>Seven weeks</HI> (that is from <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Whit&s;onday</HI>) <HI>&s;halt thou number unto thee: begin to number the &s;even weeks from &s;uch time as thou beginne&s;t to put the &s;ickle to the corn.</HI> Be&s;ides this Impo&s;ition, they have another; that is, They mu&s;t pay Yearly for every Head that is Male, the Poor as well as the Rich, one Ducat, and &s;ome|times two, chiefly when the <HI>Sultan</HI> intendeth to go to War with the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>; then he beginneth to lay the&s;e Taxes upon them a Year before-hand, and hath it Gathered in. He that hath not wherewithal to pay it, is forced either to &s;ell one or the other of his Chil|dren to perpetual Slavery, or el&s;e to give one of them to the Grand <HI>Turk,</HI> according to his liking to be his own for ever: And what is more, he &s;endeth every 4th or 5th Year through all his Dominions his Emi&s;&s;a|ries, <HI>viz.

But if it &s;hould happen that a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;hould be taken in one of their <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> (for they as unclean Men are forbid to come there) or &s;hould di&s;pute with them, or &s;peak ill of their Pro|phet <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his Laws, or &s;hould pronounce the&s;e words, which are almo&s;t written every where in their Churches, and underneath their Gates, in their <HI>Arabian</HI> Language: <HI>Leila hillalla Mahammet ra&s;ur alla</HI>; that is to &s;ay, <HI>O God only God, and Mahomet a Prophet of God,</HI> he mu&s;t (becau&s;e they are an Epitome of their Religion, Confe&s;&s;ion, Belief and Laws) &s;uffer him&s;elf to be Circumci&s;ed, or el&s;e lo&s;e his Life. For being that <HI>Mahomet</HI> did defend his fal&s;e Doctrine de&s;cribed in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> rather with the Sword than with Rea|&s;on and true Grounds, that it might not be di&s;covered, and &s;o his Adherents leave him. <HI>Mahomet</HI> to prevent this, by the Devils In&s;piration, hath &s;trengthen'd it with &s;trong Points and Articles, <HI>viz.</HI> That no body &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e or di&s;pute with any Sectaries what&s;oever, much le&s;s believe them, or read their Books, as &s;uch wherein is no ground to be found, becau&s;e all that is good and true in the Old Te&s;tament, te&s;tified by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and in the New one, by the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> is by him taken out and Tran&s;cribed into his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and there|fore it mu&s;t be believed and kept as the Word of God,

<P>Who doth not &s;ee that this &s;ubtile <HI>Mahomet</HI> did this, that any Body that he gets once into his Snares, or that falls into his Net, might be &s;o intangled, that he mu&s;t be forced to keep there, to peri&s;h and to be dam|ned for ever; notwith&s;tanding all his &s;weet Promi&s;es of great Priviledges, Salaries, and Permi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Sodomiti&s;h</HI> Sins, Robbing, Burning, Perjury, &amp;c. which Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions they regard but very little, &s;eeing that ac|cording to their Prophets promi&s;e, if they Pray but of|ten, and Wa&s;h them&s;elves often, they do not only not hurt them, but by continual u&s;age of the before-men|tioned means, they become to be cleaner than we <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> from our Sins, in the Bath of Regeneration.

And in ca&s;e you &s;hould ask them, why they are forbid to Eat Pork, or Drink Wine? they an&s;wer and &s;ay, That their Parents did &s;o before them, partly becau&s;e they are unclean, and partly be|cau&s;e they are forbid it in their <HI>Alcoran</HI>; or el&s;e that if they &s;hould over-fill them&s;elves with it, &s;o that they &s;hould bring it up again, it might contaminate their Cloaths, and &s;o they &s;hould commit a great Ru&s;ticity; &s;o that they know not how to give any rea&s;on concern|ing their Religion. Wherefore their Law ought to be called or reputed Cruel, and a Tyrannical one, that is rather upheld by the Sword than by Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice; which al&s;o appeareth from thence, that they carry a Naked Scymiter before the Noble-mens Sons, when they carry them about the Streets in order to be Cir|cumci&s;ed; and al&s;o their Prie&s;ts, chiefly tho&s;e that are called <HI>Antippi,</HI> after Prayers and Sermon, &s;hew unto the People from a high place, a burning Torch in one Hand, and a Naked Scymiter in the other, to encou|rage their own Adherents, and to frighten tho&s;e that

are of a contrary Opinion; and &s;o <HI>Mahomet</HI> pretends to his Adherents, that God hath bidden him to Conquer all other Nations by the Sword, until they confe&s;s that there is no other God be&s;ides God, and <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Prophet; or el&s;e agree to pay him Yearly Tribute, and to be his obedient Subjects; if they follow his di|rections, his Laws will endure &s;o long as they defend them by the Sword.

<P>It being &s;o then, that God Almighty hath vi&s;ited them with the&s;e great puni&s;hments, by rea&s;on of their manifold Sins and Ingratitude, for his Holy and Sacred Word, and that we al&s;o are guilty of the&s;e and the like Sins and Vices, we cannot wonder that the Al|mighty and Ju&s;t God, &s;hould, according to our Deme|rits, &s;end al&s;o &s;uch a horrid <HI>Tyrant</HI> again&s;t us, to terri|fie us very much, and come &s;o near to us, that we mu&s;t expect every moment (except we amend) the like Puni&s;hments and Execution.

But the uncircumci|&s;ed that have a differing Religion are not allowed to wear a white one, unle&s;s another Colour be mixed with it, much le&s;s a green one; which Colour being their <HI>Ma|homets,</HI> and e&s;teemed to be holy, is not allowed to be worn by any Body, neither <HI>Turks</HI> nor <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> (except to their Prie&s;ts and &s;ome Pilgrims that have been on Pil|grimage to <HI>Mecha</HI>) neither in Turbants nor other Cloaths.

yellow Bonnets: yet when they have a mind to travel afar off, as into <HI>Me&s;opotamia, A&s;&s;yria, Per&s;ia,</HI> or into the <HI>Indies,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>AS the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> in former days did excel almo&s;t all other Nations in Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding, and u&s;ed to have their Children in&s;tructed at home in thir own Univer&s;ities in all manner of Learning; &s;o
<PB N="344" REF="180">
in our times we find the contrary; for in all <HI>Greece</HI> there is not one Univer&s;ity to be found, where &s;uch Di&s;cipline and Learning flouri&s;hes as did anciently: ju&s;t &s;o is the de&s;ire of Learning, and in&s;tructing their Children extingui&s;hed in them. They take greater de|light in idle Di&s;cour&s;es, and rather love Idlene&s;s, which they have learned very well, &s;ince they truckle under the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Yoak. 'Tis true, they write the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, but which is as corrupt and different from the Ancient, as the <HI>Italian</HI> is from the <HI>Latin.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> de&s;pi&s;e them for their Lazine&s;s and Cowardize, and on the contrary they love the <HI>Germans, French</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> and prai&s;e them, &s;aying, That they are &s;tout and courageous Soldiers; they call them all by the &s;ame Name <HI>Franci,</HI> becau&s;e the Divi&s;ions of our Country are unknown to mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>In former Ages they had here and there in large and eminent Towns, in&s;tead of the <HI>Pope</HI> (whom they will not obey, nor be &s;ubject unto) their <HI>Patriarch,</HI> Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, whereof &s;ome are &s;till kept up: but after the <HI>Turks</HI> did take and po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of their Country, there is fewer of them in number, and they have &s;maller Revenues.</P>
<P>Without their Country, they have in great trading Cities, as <HI>Cayro, Alepo, Antiochia</HI> of <HI>Syria, Venice,</HI> &amp;c. their peculiar Churches, and chiefly in &s;ome holy places in the Land of Promi&s;e. As at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the Temple of Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> the place of Sculls whereon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was Crucified: and al&s;o the beautiful Chancel that is in the middle of the Church: wherein is a round hole about a &s;pan over in a &s;tone, which is, as they pretend, the middle of the Earth, according to the Words of the Kingly Prophet <HI>David,</HI> when he &s;ays: <HI>God, who now is my King from the beginning, has wrought our &s;elves on the middle of the Earth.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e, they have ano|ther called the Holy Cro&s;s, about an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile out of Town, which, as they pretend, is built on the &s;ame place where the Tree did grow, whereof they made the Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Be&s;ides this they have a great many more which I reckon unnece&s;&s;ary to mention here.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="180">Some of their Church-Doors are &s;o low, that you mu&s;t &s;toop when you will go through them.</P>
<P>They believe that the Holy Gho&s;t doth proceed only from the Father, and not from the Son. They keep yearly two great Fa&s;ts, and they eat Fle&s;h upon the Sabbath, or Saturday, at plea&s;ure: they &s;ing the Ma&s;s in their own Language, that every Body may un|der&s;tand it. In their Churches they &s;uffer no embo&s;&s;ed Work, nor carved Images, but have plain Pictures on Boards, or on the Walls. They do not believe a Pur|gatory (as the Papi&s;ts there called <HI>Latini</HI>) nor that our Praying, Fa&s;ting or Offering, for the Dead, can do them any good. And they are mightily di&s;plea&s;ed, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Prie&s;ts do not, according to the plain words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> marry as well as they, nor give the Lords Holy Supper in both kinds, as our Lord him&s;elf did in&s;titute it. Wherefore they condemn &s;uch Er|rors of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Church, and excommunicate the <HI>Pope</HI> and his Adherents on the holy Friday yearly. And becau&s;e they reckon them to be &s;uper&s;titious, they will not permit them to &s;ay Ma&s;s upon their Altars; but if they &s;hould do it, they accu&s;e them before the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>So it happened when I fir&s;t came over, that they were very angry with a Papi&s;t that had &s;aid Ma&s;s upon their Altar, and &s;o had profaned it, wherefore they did immediately con&s;ecrate the Altar again, and had the Prie&s;t before the <HI>Cadi:</HI> and they brought it &s;o far, that he was mulcted Five hundred Ducats, to pay in a &s;hort time. When he thought that the Puni&s;hmenr was greater than the Tre&s;pa&s;s or Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, he did &s;eek for help at <HI>Alepo</HI> and <HI>Tripoli</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Con&s;ul, but did obtain no great matter, &s;o that he was &s;till in election to pay the Forfeiture.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Armenians</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s a large Countrey, which is chiefly divided into two parts, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Le&s;&s;er Armenia,</HI> which is now &s;ubject to the <HI>Turks</HI>; and the <HI>Greater,</HI> now called <HI>Turco-Mannia</HI> by &s;ome, which is partly belonging to the <HI>Sophy</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> In it ari&s;e two great Rivers, the <HI>Euphrates</HI> and the <HI>Tigris,</HI> which run a great way toward the South, mix together below <HI>Bagadet,</HI> and at length fall into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf, by the Town <HI>Bal&s;ora</HI> or <HI>Batzera.</HI> They are pious and hone&s;t People, innocent, but very zealous in their Reli|gion, and receive Strangers readily that come to them, and give them Lodging, as I have often found it in my Travels. They are al&s;o very much inclined to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor Slaves, that are under <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Con|finement, and ready to help them out. Their Mer|chants, whereof there are many among&s;t them, are di|&s;per&s;ed not only over all <HI>Turkey,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>In|dies,</HI> and many other Countries; wherefore they have in all chief Towns of Trading, as <HI>Antiochia, Alepo</HI> &s;ituated in <HI>Coelo&s;yria, Orpha,</HI> &amp;c. their peculiar Ware|hou&s;es and Churches: and al&s;o in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> (whither they go in great numbers) the beautiful Church of St. <HI>Jacob</HI> the Greater: and al&s;o below near to the place of Sculls, another Chapel locked up, &amp;c. and have commonly before their Chancels large Hangings, be|hind which the Prie&s;ts keep &s;eparated from the People.</P>
<P>The&s;e, although they agree in very many Points and Articles exactly with tho&s;e of the Reformed Religion, yet notwith&s;tanding they have &s;ome Errors worth to be rejected, and &s;ome &s;candalous Cu&s;toms be&s;ides.

old Women, and there they make &s;uch Mourning and and Howling, that the Travellers that come by (for their Graves or burying places are generally out of Town near the High Ways) may hear them a great way off.

<P>They do not at all e&s;teem the Popes of <HI>Rome,</HI> but have their own Prelates, which they honour with great and peculiar Reverence: neither do they believe any Indulgences, nor Purgatory.</P>

when the Son was grown up, and came to his Under|&s;tanding, his Father, &s;eeing he had more Sons, was per&s;waded to &s;end him home to his Mother, who had a greater Kingdom than he. So he did di&s;patch him, and &s;ent along with him the chiefe&s;t of his Courtiers, and &s;ent him away with a great Train, as did become a King.

<P>BE&s;ides all the&s;e there is al&s;o a &s;ort of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who fir&s;t after <HI>Maro</HI> the Heretick were called <HI>Ma|ronites</HI>; who believed that their is but one Nature, Under&s;tanding, and Work in Chri&s;t, according to the Opinion of <HI>Macharius</HI> the Heretick, whom he follow|eth diligently; but &s;ince they have by degrees left this, and are returned to the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Religion again. And although they are &s;till of it, yet they give the Sa|crament in both kinds to the Lay-men, as almo&s;t all other Nations do, according to the Words of the In&s;ti|tution of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> In all other Points they follow the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion more than any other Nation. Their Prie&s;ts wear over their Clothes black hair Ve&s;t|ments. They live for the mo&s;t part in <HI>Syria,</HI> but chiefly up|on the Promontory of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> where upon they have a Mona&s;tery within a days Journey of <HI>Tripoli</HI> called our Ladies, which is &s;ituated underneath a large Rock, wherein their <HI>Patriarch</HI> dwelleth, whom they re&s;pect very much, and ki&s;s his Hands with their Knees bended, &amp;c. whereof I have made mention here be|fore. The <HI>Patriarchs</HI> are &s;till to this day cho&s;en by the Commons, and afterwards confirmed by the <HI>Pope</HI>; and &s;o this (when he after the Decea&s;e of his Prede|ce&s;&s;or, came into a Di&s;pute with one of his Competi|tors concerning the Election) did pre&s;ently, unknown to his Adver&s;ary, go to <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;o obtained in per|&s;on the <HI>Patriarchal</HI> Seat from the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>The Common People are in their Shape and Habits &s;o like unto the <HI>Surians,</HI> and their Neighbours the <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> that except by their <HI>Turbants</HI> none can know them from each other. They are a Couragious and War-like People, very well provided with Guns and

<P>They &s;peak the <HI>Arabian</HI> Language, and their Books are al&s;o written (as many as I could &s;ee of them in their Churches) with <HI>Arabian</HI> Characters or Letters, which they always ki&s;s with great reverence when they take them up, or lay them down, according to the Cu&s;tom of all other Ea&s;tern People or Nations, as well <HI>Heathens</HI> as <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>Latinists</HI> or <HI>Papists,</HI> living at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the often before-named Temple, are Friers of the Order of the <HI>Le&s;&s;er Franci&s;cans</HI>; they chiefly po&s;&s;e&s;s the Holy <HI>Sepulcher</HI> of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> which they keep in very good order, and read their <HI>Hora's</HI> diligently, wherefore their Father &s;tileth him&s;elf <HI>Guar|dian</HI> of the Holy <HI>Sepulcher,</HI> and Mount <HI>Sion.</HI> Be&s;ides this, they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more Holy Places, as at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> the Stable, wherein our dear Lord <HI>Christ</HI> did lye in the Manger with the Ox and the A&s;s: In the
<PB N="358" REF="188">
Mountains of <HI>Judea,</HI> the Temple of <HI>St. John the Bap|tist</HI>: In <HI>Bethania,</HI> the Sepulcher wherein <HI>Lazarus</HI> had lain four days, when <HI>Christ</HI> rai&s;ed him from the Dead, and here and there many others. The&s;e, as all know, are di&s;per&s;ed in a great many places and Kingdoms; nay, almo&s;t through all the World. Their Head is the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> who pretends to be the Vicegerent of <HI>Christ,</HI> and taketh upon him&s;elf &s;o much Power, as to pre&s;cribe to all Men Laws according to his own plea&s;ure, which <HI>Christendom</HI> finds every day to its great grief. Wherefore in the mean while they are grown into &s;o many Divi&s;ions, Idolatry, and Ceremo|nies, that they out-do quite all the before-named Na|tions. But being that they are in the&s;e our times &s;o very well de&s;cribed, that (thanks to God) they are very well known to every body, therefore I forbear to write more of them, and will only, before I conclude, make mention of the&s;e Brethren that live at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> only in a few Points, and &s;ay that the&s;e that live in the Mona&s;tery at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> are about 20 in number more or le&s;s, according as they go and come, and among them are <HI>Spaniards, Italians, French-men</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> &amp;c. that commonly are &s;ent thither by Kings and Princes; but being that they have more Churches and places in and without <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to provide for, their Father <HI>Guardian</HI> di&s;tributeth them, &s;ends &s;ome to <HI>Bethlehem</HI> to look after the Manger of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> others upon the Hills of <HI>Judea</HI>; to the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> and towards <HI>Bethania,</HI> &amp;c. but before all others, always two and two into the <HI>Temple</HI> of Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> to &s;tay there for 14 days together. But being that the <HI>Temple</HI> is always Lock'd up, that the Prie&s;ts that are within it may not want for Food, as well as others that are with them, therefore three holes, one bigger than the other, are made in the great Door of the Church, that through them all Nece&s;&s;aries of Meat and Drink may be conveyed to them. The&s;e that are thus Locked up in the <HI>Temple,</HI> do but look diligently after the Holy <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> and Read their <HI>Hora's,</HI> with Singing and Praying, and to look after the Lamps; but chiefly tho&s;e that hang in the <HI>Sepulchre</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> to
<PB N="359" REF="188">
illuminate it. There are about twenty of the&s;e Lamps, one better and clearer than the other; they belong for the mo&s;t part to great Per&s;ons, as Kings and Princes, whereof they have their Yearly Revenue, that is &s;ent them by their Brethren; but chiefly from <HI>Italy</HI> and the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, and the mo&s;t <HI>Catholick</HI> King of <HI>Spain.</HI> But from <HI>Germany, England,</HI> and al&s;o now <HI>Cyprus</HI> the I&s;le, &s;ince it hath been taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> they com|plain they have nothing as they had in former Ages; and the Mo&s;t <HI>Christian</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> doth al&s;o al|ready begin to forget them, which they have found &s;ome years &s;ince; and the number of the Pilgrims doth al&s;o decrea&s;e, which formerly u&s;ed to flock thither in great numbers, and &s;ometimes to reward them, be&s;ides Meat and Drink, very Nobly, which they find very prejudicial to them, &s;eeing they have no Revenues of any other Lands, or the like.</P>
<P>They receive the Pilgrims, that come in to them, very kindly, and treat them very well with Meat and Drink, and &s;hew them all the Holy Places, and keep them &s;o long until they have &s;een every thing to their &s;atisfaction, and are willing to depart.</P>
<P>They are but very meanly Clothed, like unto Poor Mendicants; they live very privately, and keep their concerns very clo&s;e, becau&s;e of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Hor&s;e-men or <HI>Beduins,</HI> that fall upon them daily, and Ravage the&s;e Countries continually, wherefore they are in great danger. When they come, you mu&s;t at lea&s;t give them Meat and Drink, if not other Booty, as I &s;aw my own &s;elf at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> when I fir&s;t arrived there, that twelve Hor&s;e-men, with Guns, Arrows, and Darts, very well Armed, came to the Gates of the <HI>Temple,</HI> and they were forced to &s;atisfie them, before they would leave them, and to give them good words be&s;ides. So that they are not only &s;ufficiently plagued by them, but al&s;o by the <HI>Sangiachs,</HI> and <HI>Cadis,</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Magi&s;trates at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who have continually their Eyes over them that are well to pa&s;s, for Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s is &s;o great with them, that if they can but hear of one that hath Money, they &s;tudy Night and Day, how (if po&s;&s;ible they can) they may right or

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of the Knights of the Temple of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>the Order of the</HI> Johannites.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving made mention of the&s;e, I remember &s;till an other Order, that is, The <HI>Johannites,</HI> or <HI>Knights Templars</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which did fir&s;t begin in the Reign of <HI>Baldewin de Burgo,</HI> the &s;econd of that Name, and the third King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> This Order is more Secular than Divine, and therefore quite differing from all the re&s;t, for they need not to &s;ay Ma&s;s, nor per|form any other Devotion; but when they have heard Ma&s;s, and &s;aid &s;o many <HI>Pater-No&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Ave-Maries,</HI> they have &s;ufficiently di&s;charged their Office. This Or|der was fir&s;t Invented by His Holine&s;s the <HI>Pope</HI> to that end, and indued with many Priviledges, that they might re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e the <HI>Turks,</HI> and that all Infidels and Hereticks might by them and their Adherents, by force of Arms, be driven and routed out of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. And that he might promote this de&s;ign of his, more earne&s;tly, he took in tho&s;e chiefly that were well Born, and had great Revenues (as Princes, Counts, and other Noblemen). So it hath often happened for|merly, chiefly when Popery was in a flouri&s;hing con|dition, that along with the Pilgrims, that had a mind to &s;ee the Holy Places, and to go to the <HI>Land of Pro|mi&s;e,</HI> many Per&s;ons of Quality came, moved thereun|to out of great Zeal, together with them, to &s;ee them al&s;o, and to take upon them the Order of that Knight|hood, in the Sepulchre of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the pro|per place for that purpo&s;e. And be&s;ides that, other
<PB N="361" REF="189">
con&s;iderations there were which moved them to it, <HI>viz.</HI> The high Title, and the Authority of the Place, and great Priviledges, whereby they hoped to be &s;till preferred to greater Dignities. Now as every one of them had laid before them to con&s;ider the&s;e Points and Articles, which every one mu&s;t promi&s;e and take an Oath to keep them &s;trictly, &s;ome great and potent Men found it &s;o &s;evere and hard, (as you may &s;ee by that that followeth) that they were not only a&s;toni&s;h|ed at it, but refu&s;ed openly to take it upon them. But what is laid before them that are made Knights, and al&s;o what Ceremonies are u&s;ed in it, I thought convenient to mention here briefly.</P>
<P>If there be one or more of them ready for it, that have at the in&s;tance of the Guardian, according to the Ancient Cu&s;tom, been at Confe&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o received the Sacrament, <HI>&s;ub una Specie,</HI> under one Species, on Mount <HI>Calvaria,</HI> they are with great Ceremonies con|ducted from thence into the holy Sepulchre, whither are al&s;o conveyed &s;ome other things that belong there|unto, <HI>viz.</HI> A fine Book, a Sword richly tipped with Gold, with a red Velvet Girdle, a Chain weigh|ing about a hundred <HI>Hungarian</HI> Du|cats, whereon hangeth a Golden Cro&s;s of this Form and Shape,<NOTE PLACE="inter"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></NOTE> a pair of Spurs with red Velvet Straps, which are laid down one by another upon the Altar of the Se|pulchre. As &s;oon as the Gentleman cometh into it, they begin immedi|diately to &s;ay Ma&s;s, and after that they Sing without &s;ome <HI>Latin</HI> P&s;alms. In the mean while the Gentleman lyeth down upon his Knees in the Sepulchre before the <HI>Guardian,</HI> until the Friers have done Singing. Then the <HI>Guardian</HI> bids all that &s;tand about, to &s;ay <HI>Our Fa|ther</HI> and an <HI>Ave-Mary,</HI> on behalf of the Gentleman that is to be Knighted. When this is done, he admo|ni&s;heth the Gentleman, before he taketh the Oath, to con&s;ider upon what condition he is admitted there; When this is done, he bids the &s;tanders by Pray for him once more, and then admoni&s;heth the Gentleman again,
<PB N="362" REF="190">
and telleth him al&s;o, That hereafter he mu&s;t be in all things &s;ubject and obedient to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; That he mu&s;t fight and re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> as Enemies and Hereticks, &s;o long as his Blood and Heart is warm. Then the <HI>Guardian</HI> asketh him further, whether he doth receive all the&s;e Points (as they are written word by word, in that Book, and ordered by his Holine&s;s the Pope, and &s;ub&s;cribed by his own Hand) and whether he will Swear by the holy Sepul|chre to keep them. Whereupon he con&s;ents to it pre|&s;ently, and promi&s;eth with great eagerne&s;s and joy to keep it with all his Heart, and thanketh God that he hath made him worthy of this Ble&s;&s;ing, and for having made him capable of it. After this the Monks begin again a long Song; and then the <HI>Guardian</HI> taketh up the three Pieces, the Chain, Sword and Spurs, and puts them on upon him, and &s;o adorneth him as begin|ning Knight. At la&s;t he taketh al&s;o the Book, and puts it before him, and telleth him once more what he is about, and what he is going to Swear. When he hath under&s;tood it, he kneeleth down again, and puts out his two Fingers, which the <HI>Guardian</HI> puts upon the red Cro&s;s in the Book, and readeth to him the Oath; the Contents whereof are the&s;e:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That upon his Con&s;cience he do Swear there to the&s;e following Words, Not with a fal&s;e Heart, but that he doth confe&s;s out of Zeal, with great eagerne&s;s, and with a clean Heart, and al&s;o Swear by <HI>Gods</HI> Om|nipotence, the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and his Holine&s;s the <HI>Pope,</HI> that he is a good <HI>Catholick,</HI> Educated in that Religion from his Infancy to that pre&s;ent hour; and that he ne|ver will go from it &s;o long as he liveth, but will al|ways Defend and Protect the <HI>Roman</HI> Church again&s;t the <HI>Lutheran,</HI> and their Adherents, with Words and Deeds, &s;o long as his Heart is warm; and that he will never be in a place where any evil is taught, or &s;poke of his Holine&s;s the <HI>Pope. Secondly,</HI> That he doth Swear by <HI>Gods</HI> Omnipotence, and the <HI>Pope</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Cro&s;s of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that he is a Nobleman in the fifth Generation, both by Father and Mother. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> He Sweareth al&s;o, that hath &s;o good Income that he need

Brook of <HI>Cedron,</HI> as the Holy Prophet <HI>Zachariah,</HI> te&s;ti|fieth in his 14th Chapter and 4th Ver&s;e, when he &s;aith, <HI>And his feet &s;hall &s;tand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jeru&s;alem on the Ea&s;t.</HI> This Mount is about a quarter of a League, on as St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;aith, A Sabbath-days Journey di&s;tant from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> pretty high, rough and &s;tony, full of plea&s;ant <HI>Olive-Trees,</HI> (from whence it hath its Name) and al&s;o others; as <HI>Fig-Trees, Lemon</HI> and <HI>Orange,</HI> and <HI>Citron,</HI> and <HI>Siliqua-Trees,</HI> by the Inhabitants called <HI>Charnubi, Turpentine-Trees,</HI> and <HI>Palm-Trees</HI>; the like I have &s;een but few, &amp;c, There is al&s;o &s;ome good Herbs, <HI>viz.</HI> A &s;trange <HI>Origanum, Tragoriganum, Roman Mother of Time, Spica|nardi,</HI> and a peculiar &s;ort of <HI>Coniza,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>At the foot of the Mount they &s;hew us fir&s;t a great Church, between the Rivolet <HI>Cedron</HI> and the Valley of <HI>Jo&s;aphat,</HI> which was &s;o covered with Earth, that you could &s;ee nothing of it but the Entry, and before it without, a large place three &s;teps deep. This Church was built by <HI>Helena</HI> Mother of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Empe|ror, and called the Sepulchre of our <HI>Lady the Mother of God</HI>; to go into it, you mu&s;t go down 44 &s;teps: With|in it toward the right, there is a &s;mall Chapel, where they &s;ay our <HI>Lady</HI> was Buried; and therefore, by the Benevolence of the <HI>Pope,</HI> there is di&s;tributed and gi|ven to the Pilgrims, full forgivene&s;s of all Tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons and Puni&s;hments for ever. Some are of Opinion, That this Church did formerly &s;tand even with the Ground, and that after the Deva&s;tation of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> when part of the Valley of <HI>Jo&s;aphat</HI> was filled up, it was covered thus over. This Church &s;tands (as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> &s;aith in his 8th Book and the 30th Chapter) on that place where the Village <HI>Geth&s;emane</HI> &s;tood, whereby the Garden was whither our dear Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did, ju&s;t before his Pa&s;&s;ion, go with his Eleven Di&s;ci|ples, after he had Eaten the Pa&s;chal Lamb with them, and given Thanks, according to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, over the Rivolet of <HI>Cedron,</HI> to regain us that which was formerly lo&s;t by our Ance&s;tors in the Garden. There he left his Eight Di&s;ciples, while he went to Pray, as the Scripture telleth us; when he took with him <HI>Peter,

This place is underneath a great Rock that hangeth over a great Cave, ju&s;t at the Entry of the Valley of <HI>Jo&s;aphat.</HI></P>
<P>This Valley is &s;till where it cometh down from the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> pretty deep, and is called by the holy Prophet <HI>Joel</HI> the Valley of <HI>Judgment,</HI> as you may read in his 3d Chapter, 14 Ver&s;e; which words of <HI>Joel</HI> give us to under&s;tand, that the Lord, as he was (when he came fir&s;t upon Earth) in this Valley taken Pri&s;oner, Bound, and carried away to the place of his bitter Suf|fering, Crucifixion and Dying, &s;o he &s;hall in his &s;econd and glorious coming, appear in this Valley of <HI>Judg|ment</HI> again to Judge all people of the whole Earth, &amp;c. that then the Impious &s;hall &s;ee whom they have pierced. <HI>Zacharias</HI> &s;peaks al&s;o of it in the above-mentioned place.</P>
<P>As you go from thence to the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> you &s;ee below towards your left hand, near unto the Bridge of the River <HI>Cedron,</HI> an old &s;quare Building like unto a Steeple. This, altho it is believed to this day not only by <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but al&s;o by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> to be the Grave of <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> as you &s;hall &s;ee them fling Stones into it as they go by, to revenge his Undutifulne&s;s &s;hewn to his Father King <HI>David,</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding he was not Buried there, as we read in the 2d Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> the 18th Chapter, Ver&s;. 17. <HI>And they took Ab&s;alom and ca&s;t him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of &s;tones upon him.</HI> Yet for all this, when <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> was alive (as you may farther read in the before-mention'd Chapter) he erected a Column in the Kings Dale, for he &s;aid, <HI>I have no Son, therefore this &s;hall be for a
<PB N="368" REF="193">
remembrance of my Name,</HI> and called this Pillar after his Name; and it is &s;till called to this day <HI>Ab&s;aloms</HI> Place. Of this Pillar writes al&s;o <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in the 7th Book of his Antiquities and the 10th Chapter, &s;aying, And <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> did erect a Kingly Column of Marble in the Valley (<HI>Gene&s;.</HI> chap. 14. it is called the Kings Val|ley) that is two Furlongs from <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Ju&s;t by this Pillar beginneth a very &s;teep Foot-Path, which parts a little above it into two, one whereof goeth Southward, at the bottom of the Mount of <HI>Olives</HI> towards <HI>Bethania</HI> and <HI>Jericho,</HI> &amp;c. down through the Valley that is made by this and the other part of the Hill (called <HI>Ma|&s;hit</HI> in the 4th of the <HI>Kings,</HI> Chap. 23.) but the other goeth over the height of the Mount of <HI>Olives</HI> out by <HI>Bethania</HI> to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Martha.</HI> A little higher on this Hill did our Saviour &s;it, over again&s;t the Temple, when he foretold his Di&s;ciples that &s;hewed him the glorious Buildings thereof, That not one Stone &s;hould remain upon another that &s;hould not be thrown down. And did al&s;o tell them at length, the terrible and prodi|gious Signs that &s;hould come to pa&s;s before the De&s;o|lation of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the end of the World. To this day we &s;till &s;ee into the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mo&s;que, with its large Paved Court-yard, over the Walls thereof, &s;o perfectly, that you may di&s;tingui&s;h almo&s;t the Per&s;ons that walk there. From thence, when you go up to the Hill, which is very &s;teep and rough, there is a large Plain, from whence our dear Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was ta|ken up, and a&s;cended into Heaven, as you may &s;ee by the words of the Holy Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>Luke,</HI> in his fir&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> Ver&s;e 9. where he &s;aith, <HI>And he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their &s;ight.</HI> And Ver&s;e 12. <HI>Then returned they unto Jeru&s;alem from the Mount called Olivet, which is from Jeru&s;alem a Sabbath-days journey.</HI> On this place (as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> mentioneth) did Queen <HI>Helena</HI> al&s;o afterward Build a &s;tately Church, which now is &s;o decayed, that there is no more to be &s;een of it but a New built Chapel in a large Yard &s;urrounded with a Wall. Ju&s;t by it on a Hill of the Mount towards the North and <HI>Galilea,</HI> there is an old decayed Building, which was formerly
<PB N="369" REF="193">
(as my Guide informed me) an Inn for the <HI>Galileans,</HI> where commonly did take up tho&s;e that went to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> from <HI>Galilea.</HI> Wherefore they are of opinion, that &s;ome of them were there in the time of Chri&s;t, that al&s;o were Spectators of his Glorious A&s;cen&s;ion, as it doth appear by the Words of the two Angels, that &s;poke to them, and &s;aid, <HI>You men of Galilea, why &s;tand you here gazing up into Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. But if you duly con&s;ider the&s;e words, you will find, as you read it in the Second Chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> Ver&s;e 7. that the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were the&s;e <HI>Galileans,</HI> where it is written: <HI>Behold, are not all tho&s;e which &s;peak Galileans? and how hear we every man in our own tongue,</HI> &amp;c. So did al&s;o the holy Angels &s;peak to the Apo&s;tles after the &s;ame manner, and called them <HI>Galileans,</HI> rather to bring them, as Elders of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church, off their worldly thoughts, which they had conceived in their Hearts, of the re&s;toring of the worldly Regiment or Kingdom again (which they &s;hould have left, and in|&s;tead thereof looked upon the Heavenly Kingdom, whereinto <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was a&s;cended, unto the Kingdom of God, whereinto they were received as Members, which is a more &s;piritual Kingdom, that doth not con&s;i&s;t in outward things, Eating and Drinking, &amp;c. but in a clean and faithful heart. After this they ought to &s;trive, and to make it their only bu&s;ine&s;s, that it may be noti|fied to all men, and be &s;pread abroad all the World over.</P>
<P>From the top of the Mountain, you have a pro&s;pect over all the holy Land, towards the North over the Valley <HI>Jo&s;aphat,</HI> (which is ju&s;t at the bottom of the Hill) into the Country of <HI>Galilea</HI>: towards the Ea&s;t, over &s;ome naked Mountains, down into a large Field which extends it &s;elf to the <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> that is, as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentioneth, Twenty nine Leagues long, and Fifteen broad, whereof the Scripture maketh often mention, chiefly in the Books of <HI>Macchabees,</HI> and in the Second of <HI>Samuel,</HI> Chap, 15. where it is written, That when King <HI>David</HI> did flie from his Son <HI>Ab&s;olon,</HI> he tarried in the Plain Fields until he had intelligence of him. In the&s;e is &s;till remaining the Pillar of Salt that <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was turn'd
<PB N="370" REF="194">
into, when &s;he again&s;t the Command of God, turned to look back to the City. The famous Hi&s;toriogra|pher <HI>Flavius Jo&s;ephus</HI> did in his time &s;ee it in his own per&s;on: and the Pilgrims vi&s;it it to this day, and beat off of it &s;ome &s;mall pieces, as they do every where, chiefly in holy places, and yet it is found &s;till whole, and without any defect; which did put &s;ome Pilgrims, that once went towards the <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> into great admi|ration. Now, that they might be certain and a&s;&s;ured of the Truth of the common A&s;&s;ertion, That what&s;o|ever was broken off of this Pillar, was always found whole again; they did, chiefly one of them, (as I was informed by one that had had been there before) knock a whole Hand off, and took it away with them. Now after they had been at the end of their Journey, and came back again, and went to look for it on pur|po&s;e, they found it whole again, and exactly like unto the old one as it had been before. Further beyond the Plain Fields, at the other &s;ide of <HI>Jordan</HI> that runs through it, there appear the <HI>Arabian</HI> Mountains, that were inhabited by <HI>Ruben, Gad,</HI> and half the Tribe of <HI>Mana&s;&s;e,</HI> they are very high, and afford very good Pa&s;tures for the Cattle: &s;ome among them were much noted and famous of old, as the Mountain of <HI>Seir</HI> be|yond the <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> Mount <HI>Garizim</HI> and <HI>Ebal,</HI> whereof is made mention in the Twenty &s;eventh Chapter of <HI>Deuterenomy</HI>; and al&s;o in the Thirty &s;econd Chapter, of Mount <HI>Abarim, Nebo,</HI> and the point of <HI>Pi&s;gah,</HI> &s;ituated in the Land of the <HI>Moabites,</HI> overgain&s;t <HI>Jericho,</HI> which together with all the adjacent places are very well &s;een; as well as towards the We&s;t the Rivulet <HI>Cedron,</HI> and the &s;ituation and largene&s;s of the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> After we had looked about &s;ufficiently, we went down to the place of the Village <HI>Bethphage,</HI> which is at the other &s;ide on the A&s;cent of Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> and belongeth to the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> this is &s;o ruined, that now adays there is nothing left of it &s;ave only a few Foundation-Walls. Into this did <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;end his Di&s;ciples, to loo&s;en the She-a&s;s and the Colt which was tied to the Door in the Road) and to bring them to him, whereon our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> al&s;o did ride to

<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Five days before he &s;uffered, being the true Saviour.</P>
<P>Before it the Mount is pretty plain, and is very rough and rocky, wherein <HI>Bethania</HI> lieth on the Right Hand upon one a&s;cent, of the other part of Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> as is before &s;aid, But the Village of <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Martha</HI> (whereof you read in the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John,</HI> Chapter XI,) is further out by the beginning of the Road towards <HI>Jericho,</HI> which is &s;till very dangerous, becau&s;e of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Vagabonds. In the&s;e Habita|tions did our dear Saviour oftentimes take up his Lodg|ings with them; and in the &s;ame did <HI>Mary</HI> the Si&s;ter of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and <HI>Martha</HI> anoint the Feet of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with a precious Ointment of <HI>Nard,</HI> and dry them again with her hair: in our days they are quite de&s;o|lated, and nothing left thereof but Ruins. Near it as you come back again to <HI>Bethania,</HI> in the Plain lieth a large Stone, where al&s;o you may &s;ee the above-mentioned places very plain: where they &s;ay that <HI>Mar|tha</HI> did meet the <HI>Lord,</HI> when he came up the Steps, and re&s;ted on the Mount, and talked with him of the Re&s;ur|rection of her Brother, before her Si&s;ter <HI>Mary</HI> did know any thing of the arrival of <HI>the Lord.</HI> Wherefore &s;he went back again into their Village, to call her Si&s;ter <HI>Mary</HI> &s;ecretly, who, when &s;he heard that our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was near, at hand, did ha&s;ten and went to him, for he was not yet come into the Village, and fell down at his Feet, and &s;aid weeping, <HI>Lord, if thou had&s;t been here my brother had not died:</HI> then <HI>he groaned in his &s;pi|rit,</HI> and enquired pre&s;ently after the place where <HI>Laza|rus,</HI> his dear Friend was laid, and went with them to it to <HI>Bethania</HI> that Village, di&s;tant a League, (about an hours going) or as the Scripture &s;aith, <HI>about fifteen fur|longs</HI> from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> on an a&s;cent: wherein was a &s;mall Chapel, and underneath it a deep covered Cave, where|in <HI>Lazarus</HI> had lain Four Days, as you may al&s;o &s;ee in the before quoted Chapter, where it is in the Thirty eighth Ver&s;e &s;aid: <HI>It was a cave, and a &s;tone lay upon it.</HI> When the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Friars would go to the Grave of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> they were forced to go through this Village, and a great concour&s;e of the poor Inhabitants u&s;ed to

flock about them, and did &s;urround them, and detained them till they gave them &s;omething to be di&s;tributed among&s;t them; that they might evade this Trouble, and not be nece&s;&s;itated to go through his Village, when they go to the Grave, they have made behind at the other &s;ide on the heighth, another Avenue, but they do not e&s;cape the <HI>Mobile</HI> for all that, for they meet them notwith&s;tanding, chiefly, if they know or have intel|ligence, that any Pilgrims came along with them to &s;ee the Grave. So we did find it, for they came and kept us locked up in it &s;o long, till we had given them &s;o much as did &s;atisfie them. As you come out again from <HI>Bethania</HI> towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Friars &s;hew an old Building, where <HI>Simon</HI> the Leper did dwell, in which when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was at the Table, <HI>Mary</HI> the Si&s;ter of <HI>Lazarus</HI> did come, and did break again, yet &s;eve|ral days after, a Gla&s;s of pretious Unguent of <HI>Nard</HI> over his Head, which filled the whole Hou&s;e with a fragrant Scent; which plea&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;o well, that he took her part again&s;t his Di&s;ciples, and commended her proceedings &s;o highly, that it is recorded to her per|petual memory.

Ju&s;t at the coming out of the Valley near unto the Steps of Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> you &s;ee the City again, but chiefly the Mount of the <HI>Temple</HI> and Gate where you go up, walled up in the new Wall.

<P><HI>BEthlehem</HI> formerly called <HI>Ephrata,</HI> is &s;ituated to|wards the South Twenty Furlongs or a <HI>German</HI> Mile di&s;tant from <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The neare&s;t way to it you go through the Gate of <HI>Hebron,</HI> and come to the Right by the upper Mote, and the bloudy Field, up the &s;teps over mount <HI>Gihon,</HI> where ju&s;t before you &s;ee a Ci&s;tern with good fre&s;h Water near the Path, made of white Stones, and well prepared: near which the Star did appear again unto the three wi&s;e Men of the Ea&s;tern Countries, and led them into <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Near it there groweth a Turpentine Tree larger and higher than any that ever I &s;aw el&s;ewhere in my life. Fur|ther, about half way, you pa&s;s over a Hill, at the top whereof you may &s;ee both Towns, <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Before you is a large Valley, which altho it be rocky, yet is it fruitful both of Corn and Wine. In it towards the Right Hand near the Road is an Acre called the <HI>Cicer-Field,</HI> which had its Name (as I was in|formed) from the following Tran&s;action. It is &s;aid, that when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> went by at a certain time, and &s;aw a Man that was a &s;owing <HI>Cicers,</HI> he did &s;peak to him kindly, and asked him what he was a &s;owing there, the man an&s;wered &s;cornfully, and &s;aid, <HI>He &s;owed &s;mall &s;tones. Then let it be,</HI> &s;aid our Lord, <HI>that thou reap the &s;ame &s;eed thou &s;owe&s;t.</HI> So they &s;ay, that at Harve&s;t-time he found in&s;tead of the <HI>Cicer</HI>-pea&s;e, nothing but &s;mall Pebles in &s;hape, and colour and bigne&s;s, like unto them exactly. Now whether there be any thing of truth in it or no I cannot affirm, but this I mu&s;t &s;ay, that there are to this day &s;uch &s;tones found in this Field. For as we went by, &s;ome of us went
<PB N="374" REF="196">
into it, and did gather a great many of them, that were in bigne&s;s, &s;hape and colour, &s;o like unto the&s;e <HI>Cicers</HI> (by the <HI>Arabians</HI> called <HI>Ommos,</HI> and in <HI>Latin Cicer arietinum</HI>) that we could hardly di&s;tingui&s;h them from natural ones.</P>
<P>Hard by it you &s;ee &s;till &s;ome old Ruins of old Stones, where fir&s;t <HI>Abraham</HI> the Patriarch did build a Tent as you read <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> 12.8. And he re|moved from thence unto a Mountain on the Ea&s;t of <HI>Be|thel,</HI> and pitched his Tent, having <HI>Bethel</HI> on the We&s;t, and <HI>Hai</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t. Senacherib,</HI> the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> when he went before <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> did come into this Valley with all his might and power: and had by the Angel of the Lord in one nights time, One hundred and eighty five thou&s;and Men &s;lain: and &s;till to this day there are two great holes to be &s;een, wherein they flung the dead Bodies: one whereof is hard by the Road to|wards <HI>Betlehem,</HI> the other towards the Right Hand over gain&s;t old <HI>Bethel</HI>: which Town fell to the Chil|dren of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and is called &s;till to this day <HI>Bethi|&s;ella,</HI> and is &s;ituated half a League farther towards the We&s;t at the Foot of the Hill, in a very fruitful Coun|try. There did <HI>Jacob</HI> the Patriarch when he fled from his Brother <HI>E&s;au,</HI> &s;ee in his &s;leep the Ladder which reached up into Heaven, whereon the holy Angels a|&s;cended and de&s;cended, wherefore he erected there a &s;tone for a mark, and called the place <HI>Bethel,</HI> which was called <HI>Luz</HI> before, as you may read in the Twenty eighth Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI> As you come nearer to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> you &s;ee the Grave of <HI>Rachel</HI> at your Right Hand near the Road, which <HI>Jacob</HI> did erect there, when his Wife died in labour with <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as you read in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xxxv. 16. <HI>And they journeyed from Be|thel and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath:</HI> and Ver&s;e 18. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s as her &s;oul was in de|parting (for &s;he died) that &s;he called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin: and Rachel died, and was buried in the way Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob &s;et a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's Grave unto this day.</HI> Before you come quite thither there is ju&s;t by without it on the Left a good
<PB N="375" REF="196">
rich Ci&s;tern, which is deep and wide. Wherefore the People that go to dip water, are provided with &s;mall Leathern Buckets and a Line, as is u&s;ual in the&s;e Coun|tries; and &s;o the Merchants that go in <HI>Carrvans</HI> through great De&s;arts into far Countries, provide them&s;elves al&s;o with the&s;e, becau&s;e in the&s;e Countries you find more Ci&s;terns or Wells than Springs that lie high. This was formerly under the Gates of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> whereof King <HI>David</HI> longed to drink: wherefore his three Champions did break into the Camp of the <HI>Phi|li&s;tins,</HI> and did dip &s;ome Water out of the Well, and brought it to the King: but the King would not drink of it for certain Rea&s;ons, as you may read in the Twenty third Chapter of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and in the Twelfth Chapter of the Fir&s;t of <HI>Chronicles.</HI> From thence we went by the Path of the Mount into <HI>Bethlehem</HI> the Town of <HI>David,</HI> where he was born, and anointed King by the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI>; it lieth upon an A&s;cent, its Buildings, Town-Walls and Towers are &s;o decayed, that now it is quite open, and nothing at all to be &s;een, except the Well and Mona&s;tery, but ruined Cot|tages.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t without <HI>Bethlehem</HI> at the the other &s;ide of the Path, towards the Ea&s;t (for formerly the Town reached fo far) they &s;hew &s;till the Stable, under a large Rock, wherein <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> God and Man was born of the immaculate Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and laid in a Manger. Of his coming, and the place where he &s;hould be born, the holy Prophet <HI>Mi|cah</HI> long before prophe&s;ied in his Fifth Chapter, and Second Ver&s;e, &s;aying: <HI>But thou Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little among the thou&s;ands of Juda, yet out of thee &s;hall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in I&s;rael: who&s;e goings forth have been from of old, from everla&s;ting.</HI> On that place hath <HI>Helena,</HI> Mother of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, al&s;o built a &s;tately Church; but &s;ince it is &s;o ruined and demoli&s;hed, that hardly half of it is left, as one may &s;ee by the old Walls of the Foun-Foundation, and other Places and Arches that are &s;till left without; yet that part that &s;till remaineth &s;tand|ing, is very large, covered with Lead at top, and is &s;o
<PB N="376" REF="197">
glorious a Building, that one &s;hall hardly find a better any where. For within it is paved with white Marble all over, and upheld with a great many large and high Marble Pillars, each whereof is about Nine Spans in Diameter; I told about Fifty of them, they &s;tand without before the Chancel (and underneath them is the place of the holy and joyful Birth of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>) in four Rows one behind the other, and &s;o give a glorious Ornament to the whole Church. There are al&s;o to be &s;een on the Arches and the Walls about, &s;ome fine Hi&s;tories, taken out of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, made in Mo&s;aick Work, laid in with Colours very artificially: and are &s;till &s;o plain to be &s;een and and di&s;cerned, as if they were made but the other day. The Cave wherein <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was born, hath without on each &s;ide of the Chancel, underneath which it is a pe|culiar way into it, one again&s;t the other, the Doors thereof are commonly locked up, becau&s;e behind the Church there is &s;till another, through which they ge|nerally go down into it; therein is below at the Right Hand &s;till another le&s;s one, going down two &s;teps more, which is the true Stable, wherein our Sa|viour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> did lie in the Manger between the Ox and A&s;s: &s;o there is &s;till in the &s;ame place made a marble one very well wrought. Without before it we put off our Shoes, and went in with the Father <HI>Guar|dian</HI> into the holy place. Where when I con&s;idered, the joyful Birth of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: where he, as the true long before promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> and Saviour was born, I was affected as if I &s;aw the Child wrapt up in Swadling Cloaths, and lying in the Manger, di&s;gui&s;ed in our mortal Fle&s;h and Blood, yet without &s;in, that we as Children of Wrath and eternal Damnation, might be received again by God his Heavenly Father, as his Children, unto everla&s;ting Salvation: that did humble him&s;elf &s;o low, as to be born in a dark Stable in the mi&s;erable&s;t Poverty, that he might bring us out from the Filth and Mire of Sin wherein we lay, into the Parlour of his Heavenly Father. <HI>Seeing then, my dear Lord</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>that thou art come to us into the World, as the true Light, to make of us, that were Children of
<PB N="377" REF="197">
Darkne&s;s and eternal Damnation, Children of Light and eternal Salvation and Felicity; I return unto thee, O Lord, for the&s;e thy un&s;peakable Benefits, eternal Prai&s;es, and &s;ee|ing that thou hast a&s;&s;umed our Fle&s;h and Blood, and ha&s;t al&s;o cau&s;ed the&s;e thy Merits and Benefits to be by thy holy Angels profered to me; there&s;ore I pray thee let me come to thee with the poor Shepherds, and &s;ee thy &s;aving Incar|nation, give me and us all thy Grace and Holy Spirit, that we may comfort our &s;elves with this thy ble&s;&s;ed Birth, again&s;t our &s;inful and impure one, con&s;tantly and without ce&s;&s;ation, that we may rejoice in it, in good and bad Times, in Tri|bulations and Adver&s;ities, in pro&s;perous Succe&s;s and ill For|tune, in the time of this temporal Life, heartily, until at length we &s;hall, in the life to come, &s;ee thee with all the elected ones, face to face, to all Eternity.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>This Cave is underneath about the Walls lined, with long Tables of Grey Marble, adorned with Blue, artificially laid in: the Rock that cometh out over the Stable only excepted. Ju&s;t by the furthermo&s;t Entry of the fine Chapel there are others, in one whereof St. <HI>Jerom</HI> did live, and did Tran&s;late the Bible out of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Chaldean</HI> Languages into the <HI>Latin.</HI> In another near it lieth buried, the Noble Pious <HI>Roman</HI> Lady <HI>Paula,</HI> with her Daughter <HI>Eu&s;tachia.</HI> Who after the Decea&s;e of her Husband, went thither to St. <HI>Je|rom,</HI> where &s;he led all the re&s;t of her Days in <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Piety, until at length &s;he died in the Lord. From thence we came up again into the Church, wherein without clo&s;e to the Chancel on each &s;ide were to be &s;een two Altars, covered with good large Marble; on one thereof on the Left the Father <HI>Guardian</HI> did &s;hew me the Effigies of the old <HI>Simeon,</HI> holding the Child <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in his Arms, and in the Manger &s;till another, with this Admonition, <HI>That from hence we may &s;ee, con|clude and learn, that it is not culpable at all to have Images, &s;eeing that Nature it &s;elf alloweth &s;o much unto Stones that Images may grow in them. Wherefore they are not only not to be forbidden, but rather to be honoured.</HI> But what every Chri&s;tian ought to think of this, being quite contrary to the Holy Scripture, every Child that hath but begun to learn the Catechi&s;m, can ea&s;ily and
<PB N="378" REF="198">
&s;ufficienlty decide. The <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Monks have near the Church a large and plea&s;ant Habitation, and al&s;o by it great Gardens, (rich of fine Plants and good Fruits) defended round about with high Walls, again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> which they make daily. <HI>Bethlehem</HI> lieth high, &s;urrounded by the Hills of <HI>Ju|daea,</HI> as you may &s;ee by the Words of <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in the Thirty fir&s;t Chapter, Ver&s;e 15. where he doth pro|phe&s;ie the Murthering of the Children, which cruel Tyranny <HI>Herod A&s;calonit</HI> did a great while after in Chri&s;t's time execute, the words are the&s;e: <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, a voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping: Rachel weeping for her Children, refu&s;ed to be comforted for her children becau&s;e they were not.</HI> In this Mona&s;tery, becau&s;e it lieth at the top of the path, you &s;ee with plea&s;ure, as well as on Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> the Confines of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> and the Dead Sea, and the Moun|tains of <HI>Arabia,</HI> but chiefly within the &s;pace of a League and half towards the South, a great and high Hill, which extends it &s;elf much further than the re&s;t, whereupon in former years the &s;trong and mighty Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Theck&ouml;a</HI> was built, whereof the holy Prophet <HI>Jeremias</HI> maketh mention in his Sixth Chapter, and al&s;o <HI>Amos</HI> (who did prophe&s;ie there) in his Fir&s;t Chapter. The <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had this in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a great while, and did keep it again&s;t the Infidels and Heathens for above Thirty years after <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and the Holy Land were taken; for they had Corn and Wine, and Water, and other Nece&s;&s;aries abundantly of their own growing, &s;o that they might have kept it longer, if a great con|tagious Di&s;temper had not got among them, which did encrea&s;e to that degree, that they were forced to leave it, and to retire to more healthy places. When the Heathens did under&s;tand that the Chri&s;tians were marched off, they fell into the Ca&s;tle with a great multitude, tore it all to pieces, and did demoli&s;h it to the very Ground, &s;o that now one cannot di&s;cern that &s;uch a one did &s;tand there before. But this lo&s;t Troop of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> did at length &s;ettle them&s;elves on Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> and began to inhabit it, where they are &s;till remaining in our times, and call them&s;elves (as I
<PB N="379" REF="198">
have told you before) <HI>Tru&s;ci.</HI> About <HI>Bethlehem</HI> there are &s;ome Valleys very well tilled with Corn and Wine, and among the re&s;t a very plea&s;ant and fruitful one, that beginneth immediately by the Church and Foun|tain, and runs down towards <HI>Jericho</HI> and <HI>Jordan.</HI> This is below pretty wide, full of Olive and Fig-trees, it al&s;o bringeth forth &s;ome comfortable Herbs, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome &s;trange <HI>Origanums, Tragoriganum, Roman Serpillum,</HI> which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Sathar, Ab&s;intium Santonicum,</HI> which groweth every where in the holy Land, this hath &s;mall a&s;h-coloured Leaves, very like unto them of ours, and many &s;mall Stalks, full of &s;mall yellowi&s;h Seeds, it is of an unplea&s;ant Smell, very bitter, with a &s;alti&s;h &s;harpne&s;s, wherefore it is reputed to be the <HI>Scheha</HI> of the <HI>Arabians:</HI> from whence our Worm-&s;eed cometh.</P>
<P>In this Valley were the Shepherds, to whom the Angels of the Lord did appear, and declared to them the &s;aving Birth of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Be|hold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and &s;uddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t, prai|&s;ing God, and &s;aying: Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</HI> In that place, which is about half a League below <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> is &s;till a Church, which al&s;o Queen <HI>Helena</HI> did build, as <HI>Nice|phorus</HI> te&s;tifieth in the Thirtieth Chapter of his Eighth Book, this is for the greate&s;t part fallen in, &s;o that no|thing more but a &s;mall Arch is to be &s;een of it. Hard by it did &s;tand the Tower <HI>Ader,</HI> as St. <HI>Jerom</HI> writes, whereby <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did erect a Tent, (as you may read in <HI>Gene&s;is:</HI>) and looked after the Sheep with his Twelve Sons. This is in our time &s;o demoli&s;hed, that it lieth quite in Ruins. Beyond it in another Valley not far from <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> they &s;hew &s;till to this day a large Orchard, full of <HI>Citron, Lemon, Orange, Pome|granate, and Fig-trees,</HI> and many others: which King <HI>Solomon</HI> did plant in his Days, with Ponds, Canals, and other Water-Works very plea&s;antly prepared: as he &s;aith him&s;elf in the Second Chapter of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes,</HI> Ver&s;e 5. <HI>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted
<PB N="380" REF="199">
trees in them of all kind of fruits: I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees.</HI> This is &s;till in our time full of good and fruit|ful Trees, wherefore it is worthy to be &s;een for their &s;akes, and al&s;o for the Ditches &s;ake that are &s;till there. Wherefore I really believe it to be that &s;ame whereof <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> maketh mention in his Eighth Book of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Antiquities,</HI> and the Seventh Chapter. &s;aying: <HI>And the King rode in a Chariot, cloathed in white, and it was his Cu&s;tom to ride early in the morning to a place called</HI> Hetten, <HI>a hundred Furlongs from</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>where he had a Garden with Water-pools and Works very plea&s;ant and rich. Thither went the King for his plea&s;ure; and did always u&s;e great diligence and con&s;ideration in all things, and took delight to &s;ee every thing neat and hand&s;om,</HI> &amp;c. After we had &s;een the chiefe&s;t places within and without, near and a far off of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> we returned to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> again by another way that was near as far again about, and went over the Mountains of <HI>Judea,</HI> which have fir&s;t as you come from thence very good and fruit|ful Valleys, full of Vines and Corn, but the nearer you come to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the higher and rougher are the Mountains. In this way half a League from <HI>Nebele&s;chol,</HI> the Friars &s;hewed us a Well very rich of Water, ju&s;t by the Road that goeth down to <HI>Gaza,</HI> this runneth into a &s;mall Rivulet, wherein the holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Phi|lip</HI> did baptize <HI>Candaces</HI> Chamberlain to the Queen of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> by it is nothing el&s;e to be &s;een but a &s;mall Church, and a Fi&s;h-pond. From thence we came over high, rough and &s;teep Hills into the De&s;erts, where St, <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> did lead his life in his young Age, there is nothing to be &s;een but a very ancient Chapel, and hard by it a delicate Spring on the top of the Hill, where we went up to refre&s;h our &s;elves a little, with eating and drinking of what we had taken along with us. About the Roads grow many Trees, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Charnubi,</HI> the Fruit whereof is called <HI>St. John's Bread</HI> in our Country, and is brought to us in great plenty. From thence we had &s;till a very rough and hilly way to the Church and Habitation of <HI>Zachary,</HI> whither the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> did come (climbing over the
<PB N="381" REF="199">
Hills) to give <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a Vi&s;it, &amp;c. before it a League di&s;tance nearer to the Town, at the end of the Valley <HI>Raphaim</HI> (whereof the holy Scripture maketh often mention, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Fifteenth and Eighteenth Chapters of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>; and in the Fir&s;t of the <HI>Chronicles,</HI> and the 12th. Chapter) &s;tands in a very plea&s;ant and fruitful place, the Church of St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t:</HI> and by it, before you come quite to it, falleth down the Spring of <HI>Nephthaah</HI> that is very rich of Water. This Church is very ancient, but yet pretty well built, and hath on the Left Hand as you go in, a deep and hidden Cave, wherein <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did hide her &s;elf with <HI>John</HI> her Child, that it might not be &s;lain, with the Children of <HI>Beth|lehem,</HI> by the Servants of <HI>Herod,</HI> whereof you may read more in the <HI>Proto-Evangelium</HI> of St. <HI>Jacob,</HI> where it is thus written:
<Q>When <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did hear that among the re&s;t of the Innocents which <HI>Herod</HI> had command|ed to be killed, her Son <HI>John</HI> was al&s;o &s;earched for, &s;he did climb up the Hills, and looked about her where &s;he might hide him; but when &s;he &s;aw no place there where &s;he could do him, &s;he &s;ighed, and cried out with a loud voice, &s;aying: <HI>O ye hills of Gad, take both the Mother and the Child:</HI> for &s;he could not a&s;cend them: the Hill did open it &s;elf in&s;tantly, and took them into it, &amp;c.</Q>
But how afterwards <HI>Herod</HI> did &s;earch for <HI>John,</HI> and how he did threaten and exhort his Father <HI>Zachary,</HI> to tell him where his Son was, and al&s;o how his Servants did kill <HI>Zachary,</HI> (not being &s;atisfied with his An&s;wer) for it in the Porch of the Temple, is at length related in the Books of the Martyrs of the Learned and Reverend <HI>Ludowich Rabus.</HI> As you come from the before-mentioned Church, nearer to the Town of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> there is &s;till &s;een a large Pillar, that is of great Antiquity, and lieth very high between the Mountains on a high Hill, five Furlongs off of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> wherefore &s;ome take it to be Ruines of the Fortification of <HI>Betzura</HI>: but as far as one can under&s;tand by the Books of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> that is &s;ituated more towards the Ea&s;t behind Mount <HI>Olivet.</HI> Ju&s;t before it within &s;tands in the Valley (that is full of plea&s;ant Olive Trees) a very old, yet well built

Church called the Holy Cro&s;s, whereof &s;ome <HI>Greek</HI> Friars are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: they pretend that in that place, the Tree did &s;tand, that was made u&s;e of for the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t: this we did &s;oon leave, and went over a &s;mall height through the Gate of <HI>Hebron</HI> again into <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> and made our &s;elves ready to return the next day again to <HI>Joppe</HI> towards our Ship. And &s;o we re|warded the <HI>Father Guardian,</HI> their Interpreter and o|thers that had conducted us, for their Faithfulne&s;s and Services done us according to our Ability, to their full content and &s;atisfaction, wherefore the <HI>Father Guardian</HI> did freely give to each of us a Certificate under his u&s;ual Seal, that we had &s;een all the holy places, which were named in it. This done, we went away, and came the next day to <HI>Rama</HI> towards <HI>Joppe.</HI> By the way I found &s;ome <HI>Lenti&s;cus's</HI> from whence the <HI>Ma&s;tich</HI> cometh, <HI>Arbutus, Ilex,</HI> and a &s;trange &s;ort of Willows, by the Inhabitants called <HI>Sa&s;&s;af,</HI> but by <HI>Theophra&s;tus Elaeagnus,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Olive-Trees, Palm-Trees, White Mulberry-Trees, Sumach-Trees</HI> and <HI>Styrax,</HI> from which cometh a fweet &s;melling Gum, called by the &s;ame Name, that is brought from thence into our Country; <HI>Spartium, Ly|cium,</HI> which is a &s;trange Shrub, and the Juice thereof retaineth the &s;ame Name, and is found &s;ometimes in our Apothecaries Shops: the King and Prophet <HI>David</HI> maketh mention thereof, under the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Name <HI>Hadhadd,</HI> by which al&s;o the <HI>Arabians</HI> call it, their Speech running much upon the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> Herea|bout grow al&s;o very many Fruits (called <HI>Siliquae</HI> by the <HI>Latines,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but by the Inhabitants <HI>Charnubi</HI>) whereof many are brought out to us, and are very well known by the Name of <HI>St. John's Bread.</HI> The&s;e are &s;o common in the&s;e Countries, that they e&s;teem them le&s;s than we do the wor&s;t Fruit we have, wherefore they give them to the Cattle to eat.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>How I took &s;hip at</HI> Tripolis <HI>in</HI> Syria, <HI>and &s;ail|ed back from thence to</HI> Venice, <HI>and tra|velled home again to my own Relations at</HI> Aug&s;purg.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT my Arrival at <HI>Tripolis,</HI> when I hoped that &s;ome|thing might have been done for the Good of <HI>Hans &V;lrich Krafft</HI> (whom I left in Pri&s;on behind, as is above-mentioned) towards his Deliverance: that we &s;eeing we came out together might have remained to|gether a while longer, and have ended our Journey to our content, I found there was not only nothing done to the purpo&s;e, but his Cau&s;e came to be wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &s;o that it was even or odd whether I &s;hould not have been ca&s;t into Pri&s;on al&s;o, and beaten &s;everely to boot. When thus he was detained in Pri&s;on, I received a Letter and Command, as well from his Adver&s;ary, as from my own Friends, de&s;iring me to take the Cau&s;e in hand earne&s;tly, to bring them both to an Ac|commodation; and that if I would do &s;o, I &s;hould do him greater &s;ervice, than if I &s;hould &s;tay a whole year longer at <HI>Tripoli,</HI> expecting his Deliverance. Now al|though many means were u&s;ed after my Departure, for his Liberty, yet they proved all fruitle&s;s, un&s;ucce&s;s|ful and vain, &s;o that he was forced to &s;pend three in|tire years mi&s;erably in this &s;evere <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Impri&s;on|ment, untill at length he was miraculou&s;ly delivered.
<PB N="385" REF="201">
Wherefore I got every thing ready for my Departure, and went aboard the Ship called the <HI>St. Matthew,</HI> on the Day of St. <HI>Leonhard,</HI> being the Sixth Day of <HI>No|vember</HI> in the year 75, (having fir&s;t taken my leave of the above-mentioned my dear Friend <HI>Hans &V;lrich Krafft,</HI> whom I loved as my own Brother) and the next day we put out, having a very good wind. So our Navigation proceeded in the beginning very &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, and we di&s;covered on the Third Day early the great I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> But when we approached unto it, a Hurricane aro&s;e &s;uddenly, and blew &s;o fiercely upon us, that it wound our great Sail round about our main Ma&s;t, &s;o that it was a wonder to me, that it did not bring it by the Board, or (as it would if the Seamen had not &s;truck it down immediately) turn the Ship over, and &s;ink her. The&s;e Winds ari&s;e from a Wind that is called by the <HI>Greeks, Typhon</HI>; and <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it <HI>Vertex</HI> and <HI>Vortex</HI>: but as dangerous as they are, as they ari&s;e &s;uddenly, &s;o quickly they are laid again al&s;o. The Seamen pretend, that one &s;hall &s;ooner perceive them in the Ship below (becau&s;e they come up from the depth of the Sea) than above Deck. After this had continued about a quarter of an hour it was quite over, &s;o that it was perfectly calm, and the Sea very quiet. So our Seamen hoi&s;ted up their Sail again, and &s;teered towards the <HI>Capo del Graeco,</HI> with an intention to run in &s;till before Sun-&s;et into the Harbour of the Metropolis called <HI>Famagu&s;ta</HI>: but be|fore we were aware of it another Wind aro&s;e that did &s;end us back again, &s;o we &s;tood out at Sea, and went on with it &s;o well, that we pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;land that is One hundred and &s;ixty <HI>Italian</HI> Miles long. Not long after the Wind did change, and it came to be foul Weather, and &s;o contrary to us, that we went on but very &s;lowly, and we were forced to drive upon the Sea on|ly for &s;everal Days, until at length we came before the Land of <HI>Pamphylia</HI> and <HI>Lycia</HI> (which came in &s;ight now and then) nearer to the I&s;land of <HI>Rhodes:</HI> then aro&s;e a Northerly Wind that helped us into our true Road again, and blew &s;o fre&s;h, that in a few hours we went by that mountainous I&s;land <HI>Scarpanthus,</HI> and af|terwards
<PB N="386" REF="202">
by <HI>Solomons</HI> Point of the I&s;le of <HI>Candia</HI> out towards the South, which is Forty Leagues further: and we had been almo&s;t quite thrown over into <HI>Africa,</HI> if we had not &s;heltered our &s;elves under the next Mountains, &s;o we got clear of the Noi&s;e and Turbu|lency of the Wind and Sea: but in&s;tead of that our Ship came &s;o near unto the Shoar of <HI>Candia,</HI> that we feared every moment to have been &s;hipwracked, which had certainly befaln us, if our <HI>Nacchier,</HI> (that manageth the Sails) with his Seamen, (who wrought very hard until they brought the Ship out at Sea again) had not had not for two days and nights done their utmo&s;t en|deavour. When we kept thus out at Sea, foul Wea|ther befel us again, and contrary and rough Winds blew afre&s;h, &s;o that it was very dangerous &s;ailing; wherefore our Ma&s;ter as well as the Men thought it be&s;t to get into a Harbour: but finding that it was very dangerous to get in there, they went back again to the I&s;land <HI>Calderon,</HI> which lieth not above a <HI>German</HI> Mile from <HI>Candia,</HI> to land there&punc; and to &s;tay for bet|ter Weather. This I&s;land is &s;mall, and &s;o rough and &s;andy within, that it cannot be inhabited; but yet being full of Bu&s;hes, tho&s;e of <HI>Candy,</HI> turn, chiefly in the Sum|mer, their Cattel into it. Here I found a kind of <HI>Mandrake</HI> with blue Flowers in great quantity, and al&s;o very many <HI>Oxycedri</HI> like unto our <HI>Juniper</HI> Bu&s;hes, which, are almo&s;t as high as our <HI>Pine-trees.</HI> When we, during this hard Weather, were in this I&s;land <HI>Calderon</HI> for &s;helter, we &s;aw &s;ometimes Clouds in the &s;hape of a <HI>Pillar,</HI> that came down from the Skies to the next Mounta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and &s;o extended them&s;elves &s;loping down into the next Sea. <HI>Pliny</HI> makes mention al&s;o of them in his Forty ninth Chapter of the Second Book. When this did touch the Sea, it began to &s;uck as it were through a Spout &s;o fiercely, that the Water be|gan to move in that place, as if it were in a &s;torm, &s;o that we could not only hear the Noi&s;e, but al&s;o &s;ee the great motion thereof. In the beginning it was pretty clear, but the longer it remained there, the darker it grew, until at length it aro&s;e up again and a&s;cended into the Skies like unto a thick Cloud. Wherefore it
<PB N="387" REF="202">
may very well be, that &s;ometimes Worms, Frogs, Fun|gu&s;&s;es, Snails, Mu&s;cles, &amp;c. may fall down with the Rain, chiefly in tho&s;e places that are near to the Sea: for I have my &s;elf &s;een it many times in my Travels between <HI>Bononia</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> on the high Mountains, where I have found &s;everal of them. When the Wind blew fair for us again, and we had &s;ufficiently provided our &s;elves with Wood and fre&s;h Water, we hoi&s;ted up our Sails again and came away; and at length (not without great labour and changing of the wind) we got out before the I&s;land of <HI>Candy</HI> (which is about Two hundred and fifty <HI>Italian</HI> Leagues long) into the open Sea, with an intention to go &s;trait away for <HI>Venice.</HI> In the mean time one of our Seamen did catch on a Hook, that he had baited with &s;ome meat, a large Fi&s;h, by the <HI>Latins</HI> called <HI>Lamia,</HI> but this Fi&s;h being of &s;ome hundered Weight in bulk, he brought him upon the hook by degrees to the Ship, then they fa&s;tened a Rope about his Gills, and &s;o drew him up very &s;afely. When they did cut it open to &s;alt it, I found that its Bones were but very &s;mall, and not harder than a Cartilage. They gave us now and then &s;ome of it to eat, but it was &s;o much &s;alted, that we could not eat it, &s;o that at la&s;t they were forced to leave it. Soon after one of the Pilgrims, that was a Prie&s;t at <HI>Lille</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> got a Bloody Flux &s;o violently, that he was in danger of his life, &s;o I took care of him, and gave him what Phy&s;ick I had by me in the Ship. When we came to the I&s;land of <HI>Cerygo,</HI> (el&s;e called <HI>Cithera</HI>) belonging to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> lying near to the <HI>Morea</HI> (from whence <HI>Paris</HI> took away the Queen of King <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and carried her to <HI>Troy</HI>) upon a &s;ud|den a Hurricane aro&s;e towards Night with Blowing, Thundering and Lightening, &s;o that we at &s;everal times did de&s;pair of our Lives. For when the Waves &s;well|ed as big as large Rocks, and pre&s;&s;ed very hard upon our Ship, &s;o that they did fling it now on this, and then on the the other &s;ide again, with great violence; &s;o that not only our Goods, Arms, Trunks and Boxes were tumbled up and down in the Ship, but that al&s;o we were forced to take great care of our &s;elves during
<PB N="388" REF="203">
this Tempe&s;t, that we might not tumble over board, we were in great danger. But how terribly &s;oever this looked in the dark night, yet it &s;till increa&s;ed; for in a little-while after the place that held the Cannon Bul|lets that were near unto the Steerage (where I had my Cabin) broke open, &s;o that the Bullets ran up and down over all the Ship according as &s;he rolled. Soon after the beating of the Waves knocked off the Gar|land that was behind at the out&s;ide of the Ship, and left &s;ome Nails about a Finger thick, that held it in the Wood, with &s;uch a power, that one might hear it almo&s;t all over the Ship. After all this the great Sail was al&s;o torn off and fell down into the Sea, &s;o that we thought no le&s;s than that we were all lo&s;t: for then the Ship was wholly left to the mercy of the roaring Waves, that flung her, and to&s;&s;ed her about like a Foot-ball, from place to place (which you may deduce from thence, that the <HI>Guardian</HI> that held him&s;elf fa&s;t to the Main Ma&s;t upon the Deck, was &s;ometimei above a Mans depth under Water) &s;o that every moment we expected to be overturned, and &s;o drowned. Yet in all this Calamity, we did not give over all, but did what we could for our &s;afety, &s;eeing that we could not do what we would, we &s;tood together and pulled the Sail out again, yet we did not all pull together, for it was &s;o dark that we could not &s;ee one another, but when it lightened, and in the place of the torn one we put up another new one; for generally in &s;uch Ships they are provided with two Sails, and al&s;o with two Ma&s;ts and Rudders. After the Seamen had put on the new Sail, not without great labour, difficulty and danger, they fell down upon their knees, and began to pray to their Interce&s;&s;ors and Patrons (which every one chu&s;eth for him&s;elf) by their Names, &s;ome to <HI>Peter,</HI> other, to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> others to the holy Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> but chiefly and before all the re&s;t to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who in the like imminent Dangers, Nece&s;&s;ities and Calamities, hath oftene&s;t before all the re&s;t &s;hewed him&s;elf by &s;un|dry Tokens (according to their Opinion) ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and to help, &s;o that they might be &s;ure of his help, and &s;o comfort them&s;elves with a certain Deliverance.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="203">After they had &s;aid their Prayers, they let me under|&s;tand that they had &s;een three burning Candles on the top of the Main Ma&s;t, wherefore &s;ome of them for Joy vowed &s;olemnly to go a Pilgrimage to certain Holy Pla|ces, or el&s;e to give a certain Sum to one of their Church|es. This Tempe&s;tuous weather held on all the Night long, and al&s;o for a great part of the next Day, &s;o that the Seamen Prayed three &s;everal times; I cannot ju&s;tly tell whether I was more a&s;toni&s;hed at their Pray|ers or at the Tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;s of the Sea, but chiefly when I under&s;tood, that they &s;ought, without <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our true Saviour and Helper, in this great danger to others, and &s;uch that did not only know nothing of us, as we may &s;ee by the words of <HI>E&s;ai,</HI> when he &s;aith, <HI>Abraham knoweth nothing of us, and I&s;rael doth not know us</HI>; but that al&s;o (if they had been &s;till alive) would have directed us them&s;elves to the true and only Me|diator <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And &s;o we read, That the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> her &s;elf did not know what was become of her Son, until &s;he found him &s;itting among&s;t the Teachers in the Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; and al&s;o at the Wedding of <HI>Cana</HI> in <HI>Galilea,</HI> &s;he did direct the Servants (that told her that they wanted Wine) her &s;elf to her Son our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that they might not look upon her any more) when &s;he &s;aith to them, <HI>What he bid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you &s;o do.</HI> Seeing then that the Saints will not receive &s;uch Honour that only belongs unto the Lord; and on the contrary, The <HI>Lord</HI> bids us come to him, I turned from them all to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> (when our Ship was almo&s;t quite covered over with the Waves) to awake the <HI>Lord</HI> as his Di&s;ciples did when he was a&s;leep, &s;aying, <HI>Lord help us or el&s;e we peri&s;h</HI>; and with the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Peter, O Lord &s;ave and deliver us, let us not &s;ink down quite, but draw us out from the depth of the Sea, and pre&s;erve us graciou&s;ly in this great danger.</HI> This Tempe&s;t made our Seamen &s;o di&s;tracted, that they did hardly know whether, and how far the Wea|ther had drove us out of our way, until we came quite about the <HI>Morea,</HI> and &s;aw the I&s;land <HI>Zant</HI> (formerly called <HI>Zacynthus</HI>). This we left on our right, and did go &s;traight forwards to the next I&s;land of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phalonia.</HI> This is about 250 Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Candy,</HI> and doth
<PB N="390" REF="204">
belong, as well as <HI>Zant,</HI> to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and had over again&s;t us a fine large and &s;trong Port called <HI>Argo&s;tala,</HI> before which it was 14 days before we arrived; to|wards the left, a Ship (being under full Sail before a &s;trong Wind and mi&s;&s;ing the Entry) was Staved all in pieces. Into this we got (the Lord be thanked) &s;afe, and remained there for &s;ome days to refre&s;h our &s;elves. Ju&s;t behind this I&s;land is the Channel <HI>Vi&s;cardo,</HI> wherein the Great <HI>Armada</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> did ride again&s;t the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> ones, until at length it came to a Fight before it, where the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> obtained a Glorious Victory. After we found our &s;elves in a &s;afer and quieter place than we were before, and did hope quickly to get good Bread al&s;o, in&s;tead of our old black and Worm-eaten Biskets (which had been Loaden in <HI>Spain</HI> a great while agon, wherewith we had made &s;hift a good while) &s;ome of us went the next morning into the next Village (which was pretty large) to buy &s;ome. But we did mi&s;s of our aim very much; for being that the Inhabi|tants continually and hourly feared that the <HI>Turks,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Armada</HI> was not far off, would make a de&s;cent upon them therefore they conveyed all the Goods they had into the Ca&s;tle, that we could &s;ee lye very high beyond the great Harbour, and had kept no more but what was nece&s;&s;ary for their daily u&s;e; &s;o that no Provi&s;ion at all was to be had or found: And they had &s;o little of Bread, that we went about in the Village from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and could hardly get for Mo|ney as much Bread as would &s;erve us for our Dinner. But as for Wine they let us have what we would, which was Red, and very good, which the Merchants knew very well; wherefore they bought a con&s;idera|ble quantity thereof, to carry to <HI>Venice,</HI> and &s;o did our Ships Ma&s;ter al&s;o. We al&s;o found many &s;mall Grapes growing there, on the Vines, which (as many as I &s;aw of them) are rather le&s;s and lower than ours in our Vineyards. During this our tarrying, our Pilot being Sick, &s;o that he was not able to direct the Ship any fur|ther according to the Compa&s;s, our Ma&s;ter &s;trove to get another, and that the rather, becau&s;e the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea whereinto we expected to come daily) is very
<PB N="391" REF="204">
dangerous, becau&s;e of its narrowne&s;s, plenty of I&s;lands, and hidden Rocks, to Navigate. So we got a <HI>Greek,</HI> and after the Weather began to be fairer, we put out to Sea again. But this did not continue long, for when we came out a little out of the Harbor, we had other Winds upon the Sea, that were rather contrary to us, and hindered us &s;o very much in our Navigation, that after many days we arrived only before the Fort of <HI>Corfu,</HI> otherways called <HI>Corcyca</HI> (which we could hardly &s;ee in that Mi&s;ty and Foggy Weather) not without great pains and labour. This ill Weather, with the contrary Winds, la&s;ted very long, and encrea&s;ed more and more, the Wind continuing high; &s;o that we had almo&s;t been ca&s;t over into <HI>Apulia</HI> again&s;t our intention, chiefly between <HI>Cataxo</HI> and <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> called <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> had we not quickly made the I&s;land of <HI>Me|leda.</HI> So we &s;pent our time in this Navigation, not on|ly in hard and contrary Winds, with great pains and labour, but were be&s;ides obliged to be above Deck, (becau&s;e &s;he was filled up with Goods all vvithin to the vveight of above Tvvelve Thou&s;and Centners) vvhere vve endured great Cold, and mu&s;t remain there in all the Rain and Storms.</P>
<P>After this we went into a &s;mall Channel between this and another I&s;land, where we lay at Anchor all Night: Early in the morning we &s;aw a Galley coming from the Sea upon us. As &s;oon as we &s;aw her, before we could well di&s;cern her becau&s;e of the too great di|&s;tance, we made all ready for our defence to re&s;i&s;t her; but when &s;he came nearer to us, and we found by her Flags that &s;he was our friend, we were at re&s;t again, and di&s;charged, when &s;he went by us, three great Guns to &s;alute her according to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of the Sea. When &s;he was pa&s;t by, we weighed our Anchor al&s;o, and &s;ailed to <HI>Curtzola,</HI> another I&s;land and Town, towards <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> called <HI>Corcyra nigra,</HI> which is very &s;trong, and formerly did belong to <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> but now it is &s;ubjected to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> This we left on the left hand, and went towards another now called <HI>Lie&s;ena,</HI> by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> called <HI>Pharia,</HI> which lay about 50 Leagues nearer to us. This we did &s;oon make, and
<PB N="392" REF="205">
arrived in the Port on <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s</HI>-Eve, which is clo&s;e by the Town, &s;o that one can look very plea&s;antly into the wide open place. In the morning early, at the break|ing of the day, tho&s;e in the Town di&s;charged &s;ome great Guns for Joy, which were in the next Church, &s;tanding near to the Harbor, according to their Ancient Cu&s;tom on &s;uch great Holy-days. When the&s;e had be|gun, tho&s;e al&s;o that were upon the Ca&s;tle, which is ve|ry &s;trong, and lieth clo&s;e to the Town Walls up very high, did di&s;charge &s;ome; after them, tho&s;e al&s;o that were upon the 6 Gallies that arrived in the Harbor after us did the &s;ame; at length it came al&s;o to our turn, that lay at Anchor in the Harbor, as well the lit|tle as the great ones, whereof there was a great many; there it began to bounce and crackle, (for in our Ship we had 16 great ones) and it made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the Harbor, that one would have thought all the Buildings fell over one another. This &s;hooting al&s;o occa&s;ioned &s;o great and thick a &s;moak, that we could hardly &s;ee one another. After Dinner we went a&s;hore to buy good New Bread, in&s;tead of our Worm-eaten Biskets, where|of (God be thanked) we found enough, which did re|fre&s;h us very much. In this time the Prie&s;t that was dangerou&s;ly Sick of the Bloody Flux, was &s;o well re|covered of it, that he, with his Comrades, went over to <HI>Ancona,</HI> to go from thence to <HI>Rome.</HI> After we had rode at Anchor in this Harbor for four days, by rea&s;on of bad weather, we weighed at length, and came away to the Ancient and Famous Town <HI>Zara,</HI> (by <HI>Pto|lomy</HI> called <HI>Jadera</HI>) which is accompted to be 150 Leagues. Between <HI>Lie&s;ena</HI> and <HI>Zara</HI> there lies abun|dance of &s;mall I&s;lands, where a great many Pirates &s;helter them&s;elves, that are called by a peculiar Name <HI>Scacki.</HI> The&s;e &s;leep in the day time, and are here and there on high places, to take notice of the Ships that go up and down, that they may fall upon them in the Night, and take them at a di&s;advantage, &s;o that it is very dangerous to Ride there; and that &s;o much the more, becau&s;e the Sea is hereabout very narrow, by rea&s;on of the many I&s;lands that lye in it, wherefore the Pilots mu&s;t daily take care, to get in good time in|to

a Port, where they may Ride &s;ecurely all Night-Nay, &s;ometimes even the Ships in the Harbors are not &s;ecure from the&s;e <HI>Scacki</HI>'s or Pirates, for &s;o it happen'd that we were once in a Port at Anchor in our Voyage, which although it was very well &s;ecured and &s;trong, yet we were not &s;ecure there from the <HI>Sacki's</HI>; as it had happen'd in this &s;ame Harbor but a year before, to a Ship called <HI>Cantarena</HI> (which the <HI>Sacki's</HI> did get into by Night) which came off greatly by the lo&s;s, &s;o that they had great occa&s;ion to remember it; wherefore we divided our &s;elves into four parts, and &s;o kept Watch by turns all Night long. Whiles we thus kept Watch|ing, we &s;aw them &s;everal times come in &s;mall Boats, as if they were Fi&s;her-men, yet as I am informed, there are often 40, 50, and 60 Men that lye hid in the&s;e &s;mall Boats, and watch their opportunity to get near to the great Ships, to Board them, and enter upon them. Wherefore as &s;oon as we &s;aw that they would come to us, we cry'd out, <HI>Fuoco, fuoco,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Fire, to &s;hoot off the Guns at them; when they heard this, they pre&s;ently an&s;wer'd, <HI>Amici, amici</HI>; that is to &s;ay, We are friends; and &s;o they went away again. Now when we believed that we were e&s;caped all danger, we got into a greater one by the over&s;ight of our Pilot; for when he had order to go to <HI>Zara,</HI> he did not obey this Command, fearing that our Ship-ma&s;ter would put him out there becau&s;e of his ill behaviour, and take ano|ther in his room, wherefore that he might &s;tay longer with us, he Steered for the I&s;lands of <HI>Vergetes,</HI> think|ing that becau&s;e he could get over with Gallies (whom he had all along generally &s;erved) he might al&s;o get over with a Merchant-man (that was heavy Laden and &s;o drew more Water) &s;afe and without any danger. But this did not &s;ucceed well, for when we &s;ailed along between the I&s;lands, we lo&s;t the depth of Water by degrees, and at la&s;t &s;trook with a great cracking, &s;o that we could expect nothing but Shipwrack, which would of nece&s;&s;ity have followed if our Rudder had not remained whole in this &s;triking, and lifted up the Poop of the Ship, and &s;o &s;hoved the fore-part &s;ide|wards into the depth; to which &s;ucce&s;s the &s;welling
<PB N="394" REF="206">
Sails did not al&s;o contribute a little. So did God, our dear Lord, Miraculou&s;ly &s;end that the Ship, chief|ly by the help of the Rudder (which was at lea&s;t three &s;pans deeper in the Water than the Ship) got off and went on her way. Having e&s;caped again this great mi|&s;ery and danger, we Landed in another I&s;land that was not far off; over again&s;t which, on the &s;ide of <HI>Dalma|tia,</HI> lieth the Village <HI>Mortera,</HI> between two famous Towns, <HI>viz. Zara</HI> and <HI>Sebernis,</HI> by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> called <HI>Fi|cum,</HI> on a Mountain of this I&s;land (behind which li|eth a good Village) you may plea&s;antly &s;ee the whole &s;ituation, together with the confines of the <HI>Turks,</HI> very plainly; in this Village we took up and Lodged in it, until our Sloop, that we had &s;ent out to <HI>Zara</HI> for another and more expert Pilot, came back again.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they arrived with the New Pilot, we broke up again, embarked and &s;ailed for <HI>Venice,</HI> whi|ther we had about 250 <HI>Italian</HI> Leagues. When we came out before the Ca&s;tle of <HI>St. Michael</HI> (which lieth in the Sea over again&s;t <HI>Zara</HI> on a high Mountain) a North Wind aro&s;e, with &s;uch a Tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;s, that it had almo&s;t ca&s;t us towards <HI>Italy,</HI> had not our Pilot (who knew the Shores, and Landings of Ships, better than the former) done his be&s;t, and Landed pre&s;ently, which could not be done but with great Might and La|bour, (for we were bound to go again&s;t the Wind) yet we accompli&s;hed it; which you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, for of tho&s;e 6 Gallies that met us in <HI>Lie&s;ena,</HI> but two could make our Harbour (becau&s;e they were not &s;trong enough for the Wind although they u&s;ed their utmo&s;t force in Rowing) the re&s;t were forced to go back again, and to &s;helter them&s;elves behind the outward I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Into the &s;ame Harbour was al&s;o ju&s;t before us run in, to &s;hun the ill Weather, a Yatcht, that had about eleven Men on Board; they did Pump out the Water that was run in, and dry their Sails upon the Land, by which we did conjecture that they al&s;o had not been in &s;mall danger. We did &s;end &s;ome of our Men on Board of them to know who they were; and they an|&s;wer'd us, That they had Letters from the <HI>Great Sultan,</HI>
<PB N="395" REF="206">
to their Ma&s;ters the <HI>Venetians,</HI> concerning a Peace that was agreed upon, which their Envoy at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> had &s;ent by Land to <HI>Cattaro,</HI> one of their Towns, where they were delivered up to them, to carry them to <HI>Venice</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. After this great Storm was over, we went on again in our Voyage. By the way I &s;aw nothing worth mentioning, but now and then a Village, where &s;ometimes, if convenient, we Landed, and &s;taid there all Night. In one of them I found a great deal of Saffron, which was very like unto that of <HI>Vienna,</HI> both in look and goodne&s;s. So at length we came to the large and very deep <HI>Golfo Car|naro,</HI> by which within lieth the Town <HI>Segna,</HI> where the <HI>Windy-Country</HI> endeth, and the <HI>Hi&s;ter-Land</HI> begin|neth. This <HI>Golfo</HI> is about 100 Miles long and 30 broad, &s;o that in clear Weather one may &s;ee very well over it, but it is very dangerous to &s;ail over it, and be|cau&s;e of its great motion, it is ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd from the Sea from without; over this we came (God be thank|ed) very well, and Landed at <HI>Rovigna,</HI> a &s;mall Town &s;ituated on a high Rock. This belongeth, as well as others thereabout, as <HI>Pola, Parentza,</HI> &amp;c. to the <HI>Vene|tians,</HI> from whence to <HI>Venice</HI> we have &s;till about 100 Miles. But being that it is very dangerous to go from thence with large and Loaden Ships to <HI>Venice,</HI> there|fore that Republick doth keep there always &s;everal Ex|perienc'd Pilots (to prevent further mi&s;chief) that do nothing el&s;e but conduct the Ships that arrive in <HI>Hi&s;tria</HI> &s;afely thither. And the&s;e do not ea&s;ily put off, unle&s;s they have very good mild and clear Weather; which was the occa&s;ion that our Ship did tarry there; &s;o that we all, except the Seamen, which we left in the Ship behind, went into a Barge on the 14th day of <HI>January</HI> late, and went all Night long to <HI>Venice,</HI> where we all &s;afely arrived the 15th of the &s;ame Month about Noon.</P>
<P>At my arrival I met with &s;ome very good Friends and Acquaintance, with whom I &s;tayed for &s;everal days, to refre&s;h and re&s;t my &s;elf after the great Hard|&s;hips I had endured, and Dangers I had pa&s;&s;ed. After they had made me very welcome, and &s;hewn unto me
<PB N="396" REF="207">
all kindne&s;s and civility, and I had re&s;ted my &s;elf &s;uf|ficiently, I re&s;olved to Travel with a <HI>Venetian</HI> Po&s;t in|to <HI>Germany</HI> again; &s;o we Travell'd together from thence to <HI>Trevi&s;o, Trent, Botzan, In&s;pruck, Amberga,</HI> &amp;c. (where|abouts, I found my Cou&s;in <HI>Hans Widholtz,</HI> and <HI>George Hindermayer Botzen</HI> Riding by him, who kept me all that Night with them in their Inn) &s;o at length I ar|rived on the 12th day of <HI>February</HI> 1576, at <HI>Augsburg,</HI> my dear Native Country, to the great Rejoycing of my dear Parents and Relations, which I all found in indiffe|rent good Health. I thank the Almighty, Merciful and Good God, that is one in his E&s;&s;ence, and three in Per|&s;ons, for all his Mercies he hath be&s;towed upon me, in all my great Dangers and Nece&s;&s;ities, both by Sea and Land, for his dear Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> his &s;ake.

<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Belon<HI>'s Remarks in the I&s;land of</HI> Crete <HI>or</HI> Candy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Roots of <HI>Mount Ida</HI> (called now by the Natives <HI>P&s;iloriti</HI>) extend to both the Shores of the I&s;land: When I was at the top, I not only &s;aw under me all <HI>Candy,</HI> but &s;ome adjacent-I&s;lands, as <HI>Milo, Cerigo, &amp;c.</HI> The Snow lies all the year long on this Hill, whil&s;t the Plains underneath are extreamly &s;corch'd, and burnt up: 'Tis &s;o cold, that the Shepherds cannot inhabit it in the Summer-time, but are forced every night to de&s;cend, and leave their Flocks of Goats and Sheep feeding. This Mountain, on one &s;ide,
<PB N="4" REF="211">
abounds with plea&s;ant Springs, Woods, many &s;orts of Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs, as <HI>Maples, Ilices</HI> or <HI>Holme-Oaks, Arbutus</HI> and <HI>Adrachne, Ala|terni, Ci&s;ti Labdaniferi, Firrs, Cypre&s;s, Chamaelea, Thymelea, Oxycedrus, Nerion</HI> or <HI>Oleander</HI> with a white Flower, <HI>Olive-trees, Vines,</HI> many <HI>Legumes,</HI> and <HI>Pul&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Near and round this famous Mountain <HI>Ida</HI> are found <HI>Salvia Pomifera,</HI> which is carried to all the Markets, <HI>Caper Shrubs, Mandragora Mas &amp; foemina,</HI> two kinds of <HI>Paeony</HI> with a white Flower, <HI>Tragium &s;eu Andro&s;aemum foetidum, Leon|topetalum, Melilotus vera Odorata, Trifolium Moe|nianthe</HI> (perhaps our <HI>Palu&s;tre</HI>) <HI>Heliocry&s;on,</HI> which grows &s;o thick as to cover and &s;helter the Hares; <HI>Staechas Citrina,</HI> two kinds of <HI>Tra|gacanth,</HI> which yield no Gum in this I&s;land; <HI>Staphis agria,</HI> common up and down; <HI>Coris</HI> (a &s;ort of <HI>Hypericum,</HI> with Leaves like Heath or Tamarisk) grows plentifully, the Root hath an ungrateful ta&s;te, and vomited me. The <HI>Ana|gyris</HI> &s;tinks &s;o upon the Roads, that it makes the Head ach, and &s;carce any Animal will touch it. <HI>Tithymalus Dendroides, Thap&s;ia, Ferula, Libanotis,</HI> and <HI>Se&s;eli</HI> abound. <HI>Agriomelea frutex</HI> (a &s;ort of <HI>Sorbus</HI> or <HI>Cotona&s;ter</HI>); a fourth Species of <HI>Ari&s;to|lochia</HI> different from tho&s;e three de&s;crib'd by the Ancients; 'tis &s;candent like a Smilax. The <HI>Coccus Baphica</HI> or <HI>Kermes</HI> is found plentifully here upon an <HI>Ilex,</HI> the Shepherds and Boys gather it in <HI>June,</HI> &s;eparate the red Animalcules from the Ve&s;icle or Excre&s;cence by <HI>Sieves,</HI> and form them into Balls very gently for &s;ale, for if they are &s;queez'd or pre&s;s'd, they di&s;&s;olve, and the co|lour peri&s;hes. The <HI>Dictamnus</HI> grows only be|tween the Fi&s;&s;ures of the Rocks, but the <HI>P&s;eudo dictamnus</HI> in other places. <HI>Lotus Arbor,

There is a &s;ort of <HI>Carline</HI> Thi&s;tle, called <HI>Chamaelion Albus,</HI> who&s;e odorate Root &s;weats out a Gum, which the Women in <HI>Candy</HI> chew, as they in <HI>Scio</HI> do Ma&s;tick, or they in <HI>Lemnos</HI> the Gum of a <HI>Condrilla.</HI> Two &s;orts of <HI>Acanthus,</HI> one &s;oft, the other prickly.

<P>The Bird called <HI>Merops</HI> and <HI>Apia&s;trum,</HI> or <HI>Beeater</HI> (a &s;ort of <HI>Woodpecker</HI>) is common in the I&s;land, catches Bees, and feeds on them in the Air.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A De&s;cription of</HI> Mount Athos, <HI>commonly called</HI> Monte Santo, <HI>by Mr.</HI> Belon.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS famous Mountain, &s;o celebrated by the Ancients, &s;tands in a Penin&s;ula or Promontory of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> &s;tretching out into the <HI>Aegaean</HI> Sea; its Shadow reaches to <HI>Lemnos,</HI> or <HI>Stalamine</HI>; 'tis inhabited only by Monks, cal|led <HI>Caloyers,</HI> who never marry, though other Prie&s;ts of the Greek Church do. The&s;e <HI>Ca|loyers</HI> ab&s;tain from all Fle&s;h, and even from &s;an|guineous Fi&s;hes in <HI>Lent</HI> time; they live very hardly and &s;everely; their ordinary Di&s;h is pickled Olives, not green like ours, but black and ripe, dry'd without Pickle. There are
<PB N="8" REF="213">
about 6000 of the&s;e <HI>Mona&s;ticks,</HI> that inhabit &s;everal places of this Mountain, on which are &s;eated 24 large old Mona&s;teries, encompa&s;&s;ed with high &s;trong Walls, for defence again&s;t Pyrates and other Robbers, though they who &s;pare no body are kind and indulgent to the <HI>Caloyers.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e Mona&s;teries the Ceremonies of the Greek Church are mo&s;t diligently and &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, and the&s;e <HI>Caloyers</HI> or Monks are the mo&s;t reverenc'd of any belonging to that Com|munion; the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves will often &s;end them Alms, being taken with the Sanctity of their Lives; and the Monks who inhabit Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> the De&s;arts of St. <HI>Anthony, Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and other holy places, are always the more valued, and re&s;pected, if they have lived before on Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> which is in as great e&s;teem and veneration among&s;t the <HI>Greeks</HI> as <HI>Rome</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Latines.</HI> This place is under the Juri&s;diction of the Patriarch of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> who pays about 12000 Ducats <HI>per annum</HI> to the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> upon the account of the <HI>Europaean</HI> Greek Church. The Patriarchs of <HI>Alexandria, Dama&s;cus, Antioch, &amp;c.</HI> give al&s;o their particular Sums to the Turk, who gives liberty of Religion to all that pay Tribute.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e 6000 Religious, or Caloyers of Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> none lead idle Lives (as mo&s;t of the Monks in other places do) but every one hath his daily Employment, &s;ome labour with the Ax, Spade, and Sickle, dre&s;s their Vine|yards, cut Trees, build Fi&s;hing-Ve&s;&s;els; others carry Sacks full of Provi&s;ion, Bread, and Oni|ons; &s;ome &s;pin and weave, their Di&s;taff being made of the <HI>Arundo Donax,</HI> and their Spindle of the Herb called <HI>Attractilis</HI>; &s;ome are Tay|lors,
<PB N="9" REF="213">
Bricklayers, and Carpenters; they are ge|nerally clothed like Hermits.</P>
<P>This Mountain is about three days Journey long, and may be &s;een about 30 leagues off at Sea; the Mona&s;teries are at &s;ome di&s;tance: They give &s;uch Provi&s;ions as they have <HI>gratis</HI> to all Travellers what&s;oever, as pickled or dry|ed Olives, raw Onions, &s;alted Beans, Bi&s;quet, Salted Fi&s;h, &s;ometimes fre&s;h, for they often go a fi&s;hing, their Ve&s;&s;els or Boats being cut with|out great difficulty out of the thick Trunks of <HI>Plain Trees</HI>; their Nets, for want of Cork, are &s;upported with <HI>Gourds,</HI> as they are in the <HI>Pro|pontis</HI> with the Bark of <HI>Pines.</HI> The chief Mo|na&s;tery is called <HI>Ageas Laura,</HI> and fronts the I&s;le of <HI>Lemnos,</HI> it contains about 300 Caloyers or Greek Monks; tho&s;e that look towards the Continent or <HI>Macedonia</HI> have all their peculiar Names, and contain &s;ome 200, others 150 Ca|loyers. Formerly there were good Greek Ma|nu&s;cripts in the&s;e Mona&s;teries, but now none at all, unle&s;s of Theology; no Poets, no Hi&s;to|rians, no Philo&s;ophers, not one of the Monks learned, of 6000 &s;carce above two or three know how to write or read, &s;o degenerated and depre&s;s'd is the Greek Nation at pre&s;ent: They u&s;e Wax-Candles and Lamps in their Churches, as al&s;o Statues, Pictures and Bells: They have no Poultry, Pigeons, or any other Birds; nor Sheep, nor Cows, nor Goats; becau&s;e they ab|&s;tain from all Fle&s;h: They hunt no Game (tho' there is great variety and plenty) only Fi&s;h near the Shore.

<P><HI>An Account of a Journey by Land from</HI> Mount Athos <HI>to</HI> Con&s;tantinople, <HI>wherein the Gold and Silver Mines of</HI> Macedonia, <HI>together with many Antiquities and Natural Rari|ties, are de&s;crib'd.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LEaving <HI>Mount Athos,</HI> we travelled in two days to <HI>Saloniki,</HI> formerly called <HI>The&s;&s;alo|nica,</HI> and in two days more we reach'd <HI>Sidero|cap&s;a,</HI> the <HI>Chry&s;ites</HI> of the Ancients, where now the Turks, and many other Nations, work the rich Oars, which afford yearly a very con&s;ide|rable Trea&s;ure, and make the place much fre|quented and re&s;orted to. 'Tis &s;ituated among&s;t the Valleys, at the foot of high Mountains, and yields monthly to the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> for his &s;hare only above 18000 Gold Ducats, and &s;ometimes 30000 clear of all Disbur&s;ements. There are about Five or Six hundred Furnaces di&s;pers'd up and down the&s;e Mountains, which abound with great varieties of <HI>Pyrites, Marcha&s;ites,</HI> and other Oars, which they work in a different manner from the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards:</HI> Their Furna|ces and Work-hou&s;es are all placed on the &s;ides of Rivolets, for all their Bellows play with Wheels turn'd by Streams of Water. The white Soot of the Chimneys is called <HI>Spodus</HI> and <HI>Pom|pholix,</HI> as it differs in colour, of which above ten pounds may be gathered every week. They &s;eparate the Lead from the Gold and Silver by

particular fu&s;ions, then the Silver from the Gold by <HI>Aqua fortis:</HI> Out of the Gold they coyn their Ducats, which are very flexible, and e&s;teem'd the pure&s;t Gold in the World, always clean and re&s;plendent.</P>
<P>From the&s;e metallick Mountains we &s;aw <HI>Mount Athos,</HI> and great part of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> which appear'd hilly. I ob&s;erv'd here two Serpents never &s;een before by me; the Greeks called them <HI>Sapidi</HI> or <HI>Sapiti,</HI> which comes near to <HI>Seps</HI> or <HI>Sips.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Syderocap&s;a</HI> gather abundance of the <HI>Rhus</HI> or <HI>Sumach,</HI> which they u&s;e in preparing their Skins, and tanning their Leather, which the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> do with the Pods of their <HI>Acacia,</HI> the <HI>Natolians</HI> with the Cups of the Acorns of a Dwarf-Oak called <HI>E&s;culus,</HI> the <HI>Illyrians</HI> with a black Myrtle (perhaps the <HI>Rhus Myrtifolia</HI>) the <HI>French</HI> with Oak bark, the <HI>Le&s;|bians</HI> and <HI>Phrygians</HI> with the bark of the <HI>Picea.</HI></P>

<P>In a Lake near <HI>Syderocap&s;a</HI> I took notice of &s;everal Fi&s;hes, as one called <HI>Laros</HI> by the Natives, becau&s;e the <HI>Gulls</HI> feed much upon it, by the Latines <HI>Gania,</HI> by the French <HI>Mouatte,</HI> by tho&s;e of <HI>Diepe</HI> and <HI>Newport, Mauue.</HI> Another called <HI>Claria,</HI> by tho&s;e of <HI>Lyons, Lotte</HI>; by the <HI>Pari&s;ians Barbotte.</HI> Al&s;o the <HI>Liparis,</HI> the <HI>Perch,</HI> young <HI>Mul|lets, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the adjacent Country there are Fallow Deer, Buffalo's, Wild Boar, Goats, Red Deer, and our Roe Deer, Porcupines, Urchins, Wolfs, Foxes, Hares; the Chamois or Rupicapra; the Trage|laphus different from the Hippelaphus.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="216">Leaving <HI>Syderocap&s;a,</HI> we &s;pent two days in getting to <HI>Cavalla,</HI> anciently called <HI>Boucephala,</HI> whereas we might have gone by Sea in half a day: In this Journey we &s;aw the River <HI>Strymon,</HI> and on it Swans, and other Birds like <HI>Pelecans:</HI> At the mouth of this River are &s;een the Remains of a place called by the Natives <HI>Chry&s;opolis,</HI> tho' <HI>Pliny</HI> puts it not far from <HI>Chalcedon.</HI> We &s;aw <HI>Ceres</HI> the <HI>Cranon</HI> of the Ancients; afterwards <HI>Tricala,</HI> and &s;o by the &s;ide of the Mountain <HI>De|&s;pota,</HI> through a great Plain to <HI>Philippi,</HI> near which are many Villages and &s;everal Mines.

<P>The Ruins of <HI>Philippi</HI> are about two days Jour|ney from <HI>Trica</HI> or <HI>Tricala,</HI> and <HI>Philippi</HI> &s;carce three more from <HI>Philippolis.</HI> The&s;e were great Roads in the time of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> now heaps of Rubbi&s;h, and Sepulchres of Marble with <HI>In&s;criptions.</HI> The I&s;le of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> is but &s;ix hours di&s;tant, and from thence this great quantity of white Marble might have ea&s;ily been fetch'd.

<P>Departing from <HI>Cavalla,</HI> we pa&s;s'd by Mount <HI>Haemus,</HI> over the River <HI>Ne&s;us,</HI> and came to <HI>Bouron</HI> on the Salt-Lake of <HI>Bi&s;to,</HI> near a moi&s;t

Plain, full of <HI>Cyti&s;us, Halimus, &amp;c.</HI> as about <HI>Phi|lippi.</HI> Here are taken great quantity of <HI>Dace</HI> or <HI>Dare,</HI> which they pickle as we do Herrings, as al&s;o &s;moak and dry them. The Fi&s;hing on this Lake is very con&s;iderable, for from hence they &s;upply many di&s;tant places. About &s;ix hours from <HI>Bouron</HI> we came to <HI>Commercina,</HI> where they &s;ell great variety of Provi&s;ions; from thence we went to <HI>Cyp&s;ella,</HI> where they make Alum by gently calcining the Stone, and letting it di&s;&s;olve afterwards in the Air by the Dews and Rains, and then boyling and cry&s;tallizing the impreg|nated Water. In this Journey we &s;aw many old <HI>Roman</HI> Highways pav'd with great Stones.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Mari&s;ca</HI> (of old <HI>Hebrus</HI>) in a Ferry, and came to <HI>Vire</HI>; here they wa&s;h &s;ome Gold out of the Sand, but are often forced to u&s;e Quick&s;ilver in the &s;eparation. The Water of <HI>Hebrus</HI> is very cold in the middle of Summer, and the Banks are &s;et with <HI>Tamarisks</HI>; King's-fi&s;hers build their Ne&s;ts in holes on the &s;ides, they make them of the Bones and Scales of little Fi&s;hes. The Natives hereabouts often leave their Habitations to work in Harve&s;t time: Their Sickles differ from ours, and their Corn is not thre&s;h'd but trodden with Cattel. In this Jour|ney we found great variety and plenty of <HI>Ja&s;pars</HI> and <HI>Chalcedony.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thracians</HI> and <HI>Macedonians</HI> gather all the Galls or Excre&s;cencies on the <HI>Turpentine</HI> Trees, which they &s;ell at <HI>Pru&s;a,</HI> for the dying of Silks.

<PB N="16" REF="217">
we left <HI>Heraclea</HI> on the left, and pa&s;t <HI>Selibria,</HI> a days Journey di&s;tant from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The Honey of <HI>Heraclea</HI> is &s;aid to be pernicious, per|haps becau&s;e the Country abounds with the <HI>Chamaeleon niger</HI> (a &s;ort of <HI>Carlina</HI>) to who&s;e Root adheres a very venomous Excre&s;cence called <HI>Ixia,</HI> which may affect the Bees that feed on that Plant.</P>

<P><HI>Thrace</HI> is an open Country without Trees, like <HI>Picardy,</HI> the great Plains are divided here and there with Ridges and little Hills: About three miles before we came to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> we pa&s;s'd two long Wood-Bridges that run over the Salt-Mar&s;hes, upon which are many Boats and Mills with eight Wings or Arms: On the&s;e Lakes there is a great <HI>Fi&s;hery,</HI> as al&s;o on the <HI>Propontis,</HI> for the Oriental People (as other <HI>Nations</HI> of old) are more delighted with the <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> Diet than with that of <HI>Quadrupeds</HI> or <HI>Birds.</HI> This may be one rea&s;on why the Books of the <HI>Ancients</HI> treat more of <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> than of <HI>Fowl,</HI> or any other <HI>Ani|mals.</HI></P>

<P>In <HI>Dalmatia</HI> I &s;aw <HI>Zahara,</HI> which is now the Metropolis of the Country.

The Citrons here are counted among the be&s;t of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, and are &s;ent for Pre|&s;ents to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> So are all their Fruits in very good e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In <HI>Athens</HI> I have &s;pent two months. Next to <HI>Rome</HI> I judge it mo&s;t worthy to be &s;een for An|tiquities of any I have yet been at. The Tem|ple of <HI>Minerva</HI> is as entire as the <HI>Rotunda.</HI> I was three times in it, and took all the dimen&s;ions, with what exactne&s;s I could; but it is difficult, becau&s;e the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Athens,</HI> in which it &s;tands, is a Garri&s;on, and the <HI>Turks</HI> are jealous, and bruti&s;hly barbarous, if they take notice that any mea&s;ures it. The length of the <HI>Cella</HI> or Body of the Temple without &s;ide, is&mdash;168 Feet Engli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="inter">The&s;e Mea&s;ures you may rely on, as exact to half a foot.</NOTE> The breadth&mdash;71 Feet Engli&s;h. The <HI>Portico</HI> of the <HI>Dorique</HI> Order, which runs round it, hath 8 Pillars in front, 17 on the &s;ides; the length of the Porti|co is 230 feet Engli&s;h. I have taken all the di|men&s;ions within, with tho&s;e of the <GAP DESC="foreign"> and Portico's; but they are too long for a Letter. The <HI>fu&s;te</HI> or &s;haft of the Pillars is 19&frac12; feet in circumference: The <HI>Intercolumnium</HI> 1&frac14; of the diameter of the Pillars.</P>
<P>The Temple of <HI>The&s;eus</HI> is likewi&s;e entire, but 'tis much le&s;s, though built after the &s;ame model. The length of its <HI>Cella</HI> is but 73 feet, the breadth 26. The whole length of the Portico, which
<PB N="23" REF="220">
goes round it, 123 feet. 'Tis a <HI>Dorique</HI> Building, as is that of the <HI>Minerva.</HI> Both of them are of white Marble.</P>
<P>About the Cornice on the out&s;ide of the Tem|ple of <HI>Minerva</HI> is a <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo</HI> of men on hor&s;eback, others in Chariots, and a whole proce&s;&s;ion of people going to a Sacrifice, of very curious &s;culpture. On the Front is the Hi&s;tory of the Birth of <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<P>In the temple of <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> on the Front within-&s;ide the Portico, at the We&s;t-end, is the Battel of the <HI>Centauri,</HI> and at the Ea&s;t-end &s;eems to be a Continuation of that Hi&s;tory: But there are &s;e|veral Figures of Women, which &s;eem to be <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri|thous</HI>'s Bride, and tho&s;e other Ladies which were at the Wedding. On the out&s;ide the Portico, in the &s;paces between the <HI>Triglyphi,</HI> are &s;everal of the Prowe&s;&s;es of <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> mo&s;t in Wre&s;tling with &s;everal per&s;ons, in which he excelled: All his po&s;tures and locks are expre&s;t with great art. Others are Mon&s;ters, which he is made encoun|tring with, as the Bull of <HI>Marathon,</HI> the Bear of <HI>Calydon, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI> a round Fa|brick, only of &s;ix feet diameter, but neat Ar|chitecture. The Pillars are of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, which &s;upport an Architrave, and Fri&s;e, wherein are done in <HI>relievo</HI> the Labours of <HI>Her|cules.</HI> The top is but one Stone, wrought like a Shield, with a Flower on the out&s;ide, which ri|&s;eth like a Plume of Feathers.</P>
<P>There is yet &s;tanding the Tower of <HI>Andronicus Cirrhe&s;tes,</HI> which is an Octogone, with the Fi|gures of eight Winds, which are large, and of good workman&s;hip; and the names of the Winds remain legible in fair Greek characters, (where a Hou&s;e, which is built again&s;t it on one
<PB N="24" REF="221">
&s;ide, does not hinder) as <GAP DESC="foreign">. Each Wind placed again&s;t its quarter in the Heavens: And the Roof is made of little Planks of Marble, broad at bottom, and which meet all in a point at top, and make an obtu&s;e Pyramid of &s;ome 32 or 36 &s;ides.</P>
<P>There is a delicate Temple of the <HI>Conique</HI> Order in the Ca&s;tle, whether of <HI>Pandro&s;os,</HI> or whom, I cannot tell, but the Work was mo&s;t fine, and all the Ornaments mo&s;t accurately en|graven:</P>
<P>The Length of this Temple was 67 Feet.</P>
<P>The Breadth &mdash; 38 Feet.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pillars which remain of a Portico of the Emperor <HI>Adrian,</HI> are very &s;tately and noble: They are of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order, and above 52 feet in height, and 19&frac12; in circumference: They are canellate, and there are now &s;tanding &s;even|teen of them, with part of their Cornice on the top. The Building, to which they belonged, I mea&s;ur'd the Area of, as near as I could conje|cture, and found it near a thou&s;and feet in length, and about &s;ix hundred and eighty in breadth.</P>
<P>Without the Town, the Bridge over the <HI>Eli&s;|&s;us</HI> hath three Arches, of &s;olid Stone-work: the middlemo&s;t is near 20 feet broad. There is the <HI>stadium</HI> yet to be &s;een, who&s;e length I mea&s;ured, and found it 630 feet, near to what the preci&s;e mea&s;ure of a <HI>stadium</HI> ought to be, <HI>viz.</HI> 625.</P>
<P>Towards the Southern Wall of the Ca&s;tle there are the Remains of the Theatre of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> with the Portico of <HI>Eumenes,</HI> which is near it; the &s;emi-diameter, which is the right Sine of the demi-circle which makes the Theatre, is about 150 feet, the whole Body of the Scene 256. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Guilliotiere,</HI> in that Book he hath
<PB N="25" REF="221">
written of <HI>Athens,</HI> hath made a Cut of a <HI>Theatre,</HI> which he calls that of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> which is a meer fancy and invention of his own, nothing like the Natural one, which by the Plan he has drawn of the Town, I judge he did not know. I give you this one hint, that you may not be deceived by that Book, which is wide from truth, as will appear to any body who &s;ees the reality, though to one who hath not &s;een it, it &s;eems plau&s;ibly written. I have dwelt long on <HI>Athens,</HI> but yet have &s;aid nothing. This town alone de&s;erves a whole Book to di&s;cour&s;e of it well, which now I have neither time nor room to do: but I have Memorials by me of all I &s;aw, which one day, if it plea&s;e God, I may &s;hew you.</P>
<P><HI>Thebes</HI> is a large Town, but I found few An|tiquities in it, excepting &s;ome In&s;criptions and Fragments of the Old Wall, and one Gate, which, they &s;ay, was left by <HI>Alexander,</HI> when he demoli&s;h'd the re&s;t. It is about &s;ome fifty miles di&s;tant from <HI>Athens,</HI> as I judge.</P>
<P><HI>Corinth</HI> is two days Journey di&s;tant: the Ca&s;tle or <GAP DESC="foreign"> is &s;tanding, which is very large. The main of the Town is demoli&s;h'd, and the Hou&s;es, which now are &s;catter'd, and a great di&s;tance from one another. So is <HI>Argos,</HI> which to go round would be &s;ome four or five miles, as the Hou&s;es now &s;tand; but if they &s;tood toge|ther, they would &s;carce exceed a good Village. <HI>Napolo della Rumilia</HI> is a large town, and full of Inhabitants, and the Ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a of the <HI>Morea</HI> re&s;ides there: It is but very few leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Argos.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="222"><HI>Sparta</HI> is quite for&s;aken, and <HI>Me&s;tra</HI> is the Town which is inhabited, four miles di&s;tant from it: But one &s;ees great Ruines thereabout; almo&s;t all the Walls, &s;everal Towers and Foun|dations of Temples with Pillars and Chapiters demoli&s;h'd: A Theatre pretty entire. It might have been anciently &s;ome five miles in compa&s;s, and about a quarter of a mile di&s;tant from the River <HI>Eurotus.</HI> The Plain of <HI>Sparta</HI> and of <HI>La|conia</HI> is very fruitful, and long, and well wate|red. It will be about eighty miles in length, as I judge. The Mountains on the We&s;t &s;ide of it very high, the highe&s;t I have yet &s;een in <HI>Greece</HI>; the <HI>Maniotes</HI> inhabit them. But the Plain of <HI>Calamatta,</HI> which anciently was that of <HI>Me&s;&s;ene,</HI> &s;eems rather richer. <HI>Corone</HI> is very abundant in Olives. <HI>Navarrino,</HI> which is <HI>e&s;tee|med</HI> the ancient <HI>Pylos,</HI> hath a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle, fortified by the Turks, and is the be&s;t Port in all the <HI>Morea. Alpheus</HI> is much the be&s;t River, and the deepe&s;t, and with great rea&s;on extolled by all the ancient Poets, and cho&s;en for the Seat of the Olympick Games, for it's very plea&s;ant. The Plains of <HI>Elis</HI> are very good|ly and large, fit to breathe Hor&s;es in, and for hunting, but not &s;o fruitful as that of <HI>Argos</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;ene,</HI> which are all Riches. The be&s;t Woods I &s;aw in <HI>Peloponne&s;us</HI> are tho&s;e of <HI>Achaia,</HI> aboun|ding with <HI>Pines</HI> and wild <HI>Pear,</HI> the <HI>Ilex</HI> and <HI>E&s;culus</HI>-trees, and, where there runs Water, with <HI>Plane</HI>-trees.</P>
<P><HI>Arcadia</HI> is a very goodly Champain, and full of Cattel, but is all encompa&s;s'd with Hills, which are very rough and unhewn. <HI>Lepanto</HI> is very plea&s;antly &s;eated on the Gulf, which runs up as far as <HI>Corinth</HI>; and without the Town is one of the fine&s;t Fountains I &s;aw in <HI>Greece,</HI> very
<PB N="27" REF="222">
rich in Veins of Water, and &s;haded with huge Plane-trees, not inferiour in any thing to the Spring of <HI>Ca&s;talia</HI> on Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> which runs through <HI>Delphos,</HI> except in this, that one was cho&s;en by the Mu&s;es, and the other not; and Poetical Fancies have given Immortality to the one, and never mentioned the other.</P>
<P><HI>Delphos</HI> it &s;elf is very &s;trangely &s;ituated on a rugged Hill, to which you have an a&s;cent of &s;ome two or three leagues, and yet that is not a quarter of the way to come up to the Pique of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> on the &s;ide of which Hill it &s;tands: It &s;eems very barren to the Eye, but the Fruits are very good, where there are any. The Wines are excellent, and the Plants and Simples, which are found there, very fragrant, and of great effi|cacy.</P>
<P>About <HI>Lebadia,</HI> and all through <HI>Baeotia,</HI> the Plains are very fertile, and make amends for the barrenne&s;s of the Hills which encompa&s;s them: But in Winter they are apt to be over|flown for that rea&s;on, and to be turn'd into Lakes, which renders the <HI>Baeotian</HI> Air very thick, and &s;o were their Sculls too, if the Ancients may be believed concerning them; though <HI>Pindar,</HI> who was one that &s;ublimated Poetry to its high|e&s;t exaltation, and is much fancied and imitated in our Age, as he was admired in his own, was born there: And <HI>Amphion,</HI> who was &s;aid to be &s;o divine in his Mu&s;ick, that he ravi&s;h'd the very Stones, had skill enough to entice them to make up the Walls of <HI>Thebes:</HI> So that not every thing that is born in a dull Air is dull. The&s;e Vales I found much planted with <HI>Cotton,</HI> and <HI>Se&s;amum,</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> of which they make great profit, and a great Trade at <HI>Thebes</HI> and <HI>Lebadia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="223">I went from <HI>Thebes</HI> into the I&s;land of <HI>Eubaea</HI> or <HI>Negropont,</HI> and &s;aw the <HI>Euripus,</HI> which ebbs and flows much after the nature of our Tides, only the Moon, and &s;ometimes Winds, make it irre|gular. The Channel, which runs between the Town and a Ca&s;tle which &s;tands in an I&s;land over again&s;t it, is &s;ome fifty feet broad; and there are three Mills on it, which &s;hew all the changes and varieties that happen in the Cur|rent. Near the <HI>Euripus,</HI> and oppo&s;ite to the Town, they &s;hew a Port, which they &s;ay was <HI>Aulis,</HI> and it is not improbable, for it mu&s;t be thereabouts.

<P>The Government is perfectly arbitrary and de&s;potical; the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Em|peror having the force and power of a Law, and oftentimes is above it. His bare Command, without any proce&s;s, is enough to take off the Head of any Per&s;on, (though never &s;o eminent in Dignity; though u&s;ually for formality, and to &s;ilence the murmurings of the Souldiery and People, the Sentence is confirmed by the <HI>Mufti.</HI>) Sometimes <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s, who have ama&s;&s;ed great Trea&s;ures in their Governments, are cut off in their own Hou&s;es in the mid&s;t of their Retinue, the Me&s;&s;engers of Death producing the Imperial Command, u&s;ually &s;ent in a black Pur&s;e, and not a Sword drawn in their defence.

In the Army Commands are gi|ven according to merit, Courage and Conduct are &s;ure to be rewarded, the way lying open to the meane&s;t Souldier to rai&s;e him&s;elf to be the Chief of his Order. But other Preferments de|pend upon meer Chance, and upon the Fancy of the Emperor, whether the per&s;on be fit or no, and they are as &s;oon lo&s;t. The lea&s;t ill &s;uc|ce&s;s or mi&s;carriage proves oftentimes fatal, and a more lucky man is put in his place, and he &s;uc|ceeded by a third, if unfortunate in a de&s;ign, though managed with never &s;o much Prudence

and Valour. They admit of no hereditary Ho|nours, and have no re&s;pect to De&s;cent or Blood, except the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family; he only is great and noble whom the Emperor favours, and while his Command la&s;ts. According to a Tra|dition that pa&s;&s;es current among&s;t them, a Ba&s;|&s;a's Son by a <HI>Sultana,</HI> or a Daughter or Si&s;ter of the Emperor, can ri&s;e no higher than to be a <HI>Sangiacbei,</HI> or Governor of &s;ome little Province, much inferiour to a Ba&s;&s;a, and under his Juri&s;di|ction. Being born of Slaves for the mo&s;t part, they do not pride them&s;elves in their Birth, very few among them being &s;carce able to give any account of their Grandfathers. They have no Sirnames, but are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons and places of abode, and enjoying by Law a liberty of having what Women they plea&s;e, they have little or no regard to Alliance or Kindred.</P>
<P>Their Empire owes the continuance of its Being to the &s;everity of the Government, which oftentimes takes place without regard either to Ju&s;tice or Equity, and to their frequent Wars, which prevent all occa&s;ions of Mutiny and Fa|ction among the Souldiers, which happen fre|quently when unemploy'd. So that tho' Ambi|tion may put a warlike Sultan upon enlarging his Territories by new Conque&s;ts, yet rea&s;on of State forces a weak and effeminate Prince, &s;uch as was <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> to make War for his own &s;ecu|rity. Their Politicks are not owing to Books and Study, and the Examples of pa&s;t-times, but to Experience, and the plain &s;ugge&s;tions of Na|ture and common Sence: They have Rules of Government, which they firmly adhere to, hol|ding the Reins &s;treight, e&s;pecially being cruel and inexorable to Criminals of State, who never are

to expect any Mercy or Pity. Their Councils formerly were open, and their De&s;igns known, and proclaimed before-hand, as if this had been a Bravery becoming their greatne&s;s, and that they &s;corned to &s;teal a Conque&s;t. But they have learned &s;ince the Art of Di&s;&s;imulation, and can lye and &s;wear for their Intere&s;t, and &s;eem ex|ce&s;&s;ive in their Care&s;&s;es to the Mini&s;ters of tho&s;e Countries, which they intend to invade. But their Preparations for arming are made with &s;o much noi&s;e, that an ordinary Jealou&s;ie is &s;oon awakened by it to oppo&s;e them, in ca&s;e of an attack. They &s;eldom or never care to have War at both Extremes of the Empire at the &s;ame time, and therefore they are mighty &s;ollicitous to &s;ecure a Peace with <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> when they intend a War upon the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>; and as much as is po&s;&s;ible, they avoid quarrelling with two <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes at once, being u&s;ually at league either with <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> when they war upon <HI>Hungary,</HI> and &s;o on the contrary; dread|ing nothing more than a Union of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes bordering upon them, which would prove &s;o fatal to their Empire, and quickly put a Period to their Greatne&s;s; for hereby they would be put upon a nece&s;&s;ity of making a de|fen&s;ive War, to their great lo&s;s and di&s;advan|tage, and at la&s;t either be forced to beg a Peace of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or run the hazard of lo&s;ing all by a further pro&s;ecution of War.</P>
<P>This they are very &s;en&s;ible of, and therefore as they take all occa&s;ion to promote Quarrels and Di&s;&s;entions in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;o they greatly rejoyce, when the Princes of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> are at War one with another. This is their great time of advantage, and they know, that it is their true Intere&s;t to pur&s;ue it, though they
<PB N="80" REF="248">
do not always, by rea&s;on of the ill condition of their own Affairs, make u&s;e of it. During the Civil Wars of <HI>Germany,</HI> the Ba&s;&s;a's and other Commanders of the Army were very im|portunate with the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> to make a War on that &s;ide, and to enlarge his Conque&s;ts as far as <HI>Vienna,</HI> no conjuncture having been ever &s;o favourable to con&s;ummate &s;uch a de&s;ign, in which <HI>Solyman</HI> &s;o unhappily mi&s;carried. They promi&s;ed him an ea&s;ie Victory, a&s;&s;uring him, that the Animo&s;ities of the Princes of the Empire were &s;o heightned, that there was no room left for a Reconciliation, that he was but to go in the Head of an Army to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> would &s;urrender at the fir&s;t news of his march towards it. The Emperor was not to be moved at that time by the&s;e In&s;inua|tions and plau&s;ible Di&s;cour&s;es; being continual|ly urged, he as often denyed. One day when they came to renew their Advice about the <HI>Ger|man</HI> War, he having given order before, that &s;everal Dogs &s;hould be kept for &s;ome days with|out Meat, commanded that they &s;hould be brought out, being almo&s;t &s;tarved, and Meat thrown among them; whereupon they &s;nailed and bit one another: In the mid&s;t of their noi&s;e and fighting he cau&s;ed a Bear to be let loo&s;e in the &s;ame Area; the Dogs forgetting their Meat and leaving off their fighting, ran all upon the Bear, ready to prey upon them &s;ingly, and at la&s;t killed him. This Diver&s;ion the Emperor gave his Ba&s;&s;a's, and left them to make the ap|plication.</P>
<P>A certain Prophecy, of no &s;mall Authority, runs in the minds of all the People, and has gain'd great credit and belief among them, that their Empire &s;hall be ruined by a Northern

Nation, which has white and yellowi&s;h Hair. The Interpretation is as various as their Fancy. Some <HI>fix</HI> this Character on the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI>; and the poor <HI>Greeks</HI> flatter them&s;elves with fooli&s;h hopes, that they are to be their Deliverers, and to re&s;cue them from their Slavery, chiefly be|cau&s;e they are of their Communion, and owe their Conver&s;ion to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Faith, to the Piety and Zeal of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Bi&s;hops formerly. Others look upon the <HI>Sweeds,</HI> as the per&s;ons de|&s;crib'd in the Prophecy, whom they are mo&s;t to fear. The Ground and Original of his Fan|cy, I &s;uppo&s;e, is owing to the great Opinion which they have of the Valour and Courage of that warlike Nation. The great Victories of the <HI>Sweeds</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> under <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> were loudly proclaimed at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as if there were no with&s;tanding the &s;hock and fury of their Arms: and their continued Succe&s;&s;es con|firmed the <HI>Turks</HI> in their fir&s;t Belief, and their Fears and their Jealou&s;ies were augmented after|wards, when <HI>Charles Gu&s;tave,</HI> a Prince of as he|roick a Courage, and as great Abilities in the Art and Management of War as the ju&s;tly admi|red <HI>Gu&s;tavus,</HI> entred <HI>Poland</HI> with his Army, and carried all before him, &s;eized upon <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> and drove <HI>Ca&s;imire</HI> out of his Kingdom, and had al|mo&s;t made an entire and ab&s;olute Conque&s;t, only a few places holding out. This alarmed the Grand Signior, and the Ba&s;&s;a's of the <HI>Port,</HI> as if the Prophecy were then about to be fulfilled, who did not care for the company of &s;uch trou|ble&s;ome Neighbours, who might pu&s;h on their Victories, and joyning with the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> advance their Arms further, and make their Country the Seat of a War, which might draw after it fatal con&s;equences.

<P>UPON intimation of your Grace's De&s;ires, and upon importunity of &s;ome Learned men, having fini&s;hed a Table, as a Key to your Grace's exqui&s;ite di&s;qui&s;ition, touching <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> properly &s;o called; I thought my &s;elf obliged to give both you and them a rea&s;on, why in the &s;ituation of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> and the I&s;land <HI>Rhodus,</HI> (which two eminent places I have made the <GAP DESC="foreign"> and Bounds of the Chart) I di&s;&s;ent from the Traditions of the Ancients, and from the Tables of our late and be&s;t Geographers, and con&s;equently di&s;&s;enting in the&s;e, have been ne|ce&s;&s;itated to alter the Latitudes, if not Longi|tudes, of mo&s;t of the remarkable Cities of this Di&s;cour&s;e. And fir&s;t for <HI>Byzantium,</HI> the received Latitude of it by <HI>Appianus, Mercator, Ortelius, Maginnus,</HI> and &s;ome others, is 43 degrees and 5 minutes. And this al&s;o we find in the <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> Edition of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s Geography, procured by
<PB N="85" REF="250">
<HI>Era&s;mus</HI> out of a Greek MS. of <HI>Pettichius.</HI> The &s;ame likewi&s;e is confirmed by another choice MS. in Greek, of the mo&s;t learned and judicious Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI> to whom for this favour and &s;everal others I &s;tand obliged. And as much is expre&s;|&s;ed in the late Edition of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> by <HI>Bertius,</HI> com|pared and corrected by <HI>Sylburgius,</HI> with a Ma|nu&s;cript out of the Palatine Library. Where|fore it cannot be doubted, having &s;uch a cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, but that <HI>Ptolemy</HI> a&s;&s;igned to <HI>Byzan|tium,</HI> as our be&s;t modern Geographers have done, the Latitude of 43&deg;. 5&prime;. And this will farther appear, not only out of his Geography, where it is often expre&s;&s;ed, but al&s;o out of his <GAP DESC="foreign"> or Almage&s;t, as the <HI>Arabians</HI> term it, where de&s;cribing the Parallel pa&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="foreign">, he a&s;&s;igns to it 43&deg;. 5&prime;. What was the Opinion concerning <HI>Byzantium</HI> of <HI>Strabo</HI> prece|ding <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> or of <HI>Hipparchus</HI> preceding <HI>Strabo,</HI> or of <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> ancienter, and it may be ac|curater than all of them, (for <HI>Strabo</HI> (<HI>lib.</HI> 2.) calls him <GAP DESC="foreign">) though <HI>Tully</HI> (Lib. Ep. ad <HI>Att.</HI>) makes <HI>Hipparchus</HI> often reprehended <HI>Erato&s;thenes,</HI> as <HI>Ptolemy</HI> after him doth <HI>Marinus,</HI> their Writings not being now extant, (unle&s;s tho&s;e of <HI>Strabo</HI>) cannot be deter|mined by us. But as for <HI>Strabo,</HI> in our enquiry, we can expect little &s;atisfaction; for his de&s;cri|ption of places, having more of the Hi&s;torian and Philo&s;opher, (both which he hath perfor|med with &s;ingular Gravity and Judgment) than the exactne&s;s of a Mathematician, who &s;trictly re&s;pects the Po&s;ition of places, without inqui&s;i|tion after their Nature, Qualities, and Inhabi|tants, (though the be&s;t Geography would be a mixture of them all, as <HI>Abulfeda,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince in his <HI>Rectification</HI> of <HI>Countries</HI> above
<PB N="86" REF="251">
Three hundred years &s;ince hath done;) I &s;ay for the&s;e Rea&s;ons we can expect little &s;atisfa|ction from <HI>Strabo,</HI> and le&s;s may we hope for from <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer, Arrianus, Stephanus Byzanti|nus,</HI> and others. Wherefore next having re|cour&s;e to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who in Geography de|&s;erve the &s;econd place after the <HI>Grecians,</HI> I find in <HI>Na&s;&s;ir Eddin</HI> the Latitude of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> which he terms <HI>Buzantiya,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantiniya,</HI> to be 45 degrees, and in <HI>Ulug Beg</HI>'s A&s;tronomical Tables the &s;ame to be expre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Abulfeda</HI> chiefly fol|lows four principal Authors as his Guides, in the compiling of his Geographical Tables, tho&s;e are <HI>Alfaras, Albiruny, Hon Saiid Almagraby,</HI> la&s;tly, <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> who&s;e Geography he terms a <HI>de&s;cription of the Quadrant,</HI> (or the fourth part of the Earth) inhabited; and all the&s;e, according to his a&s;&s;ertion, place <HI>Byzantium</HI> in 45 degrees of Latitude. And here it may ju&s;tly be wonder'd how this difference &s;hould ari&s;e between the Greek Copies of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> and tho&s;e tran&s;lated into <HI>Arabick</HI> by the command of <HI>Almamon,</HI> the learned <HI>Calife</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI>; for <HI>Abulfeda</HI> expre&s;ly relates, that <HI>Ptolemy</HI> was fir&s;t interpreted in his time, that is, in the computation of <HI>Almeeinus,</HI> in <HI>Erpenius</HI>'s Edition, and of <HI>Emir Cond</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hi&s;toriographer, more than 800 years &s;ince; concerning which <HI>Abulfeda</HI> writes thus, <HI>This Book</HI> (di&s;cour&s;ing of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>'s Geography) <HI>was tran&s;la|ted out of the Graecian Language into the Arabick for Almamon:</HI> And in this I find (by three fair MSS of <HI>Abulfeda</HI>) <HI>Byzantium</HI> to be con&s;tantly placed in 45&deg;. and as con&s;tantly in the Greek Copies in 43&deg;. 5&prime;. But in the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of <HI>Chry&s;ococ|ca,</HI> out of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tables, (made about the year 1346. in <HI>Scaliger</HI>'s Calculation) it is placed in 45&deg;. To reconcile the difference between the

<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> may &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible, for the common refuge of flying to the corruption of numbers by Tran&s;cribers, and laying the fault on them, which &s;ometimes is the Author's, will not help us in this particular; &s;eeing the Greek Copies agree among&s;t them&s;elves, and the <HI>Ara|bick</HI> among&s;t them&s;elves. The be&s;t way to end the Di&s;pute, will be, to give credit concerning the Latitude of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> neither to the <HI>Greeks</HI> nor <HI>Arabians.</HI> And that I have rea&s;on for this A&s;&s;ertion, appears by &s;everal Ob&s;ervations of mine at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with a Bra&s;s Sextant of above four foot Radius. Where taking, in the Summer Sol&s;tice, the Meridian Altitude of the Sun, without u&s;ing any <GAP DESC="foreign"> for the Pa|rallax and Refraction, (which at that time was not nece&s;&s;ary) I found the Latitude to be 41 de|grees 6 minutes. And in this Latitude in the Chart I have placed <HI>Byzantium,</HI> and not in that either of the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Arabians.</HI> From which Ob&s;ervation, being of &s;ingular u&s;e in the rectifi|cation of Geography, it will follow by way of Corallary, that all Maps for the North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> adjoyning upon the <HI>Bo&s;phorus Thracius,</HI> the <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> and much farther, are to be corrected; and con&s;equently the &s;itua|tion of mo&s;t Cities in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> properly &s;o called, are to be brought more Southerly than tho&s;e of <HI>Pto|lemy,</HI> by almo&s;t two entire degrees, and then tho&s;e of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> by almo&s;t four.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Rhodes,</HI> it may be pre&s;umed, that having been the Mother, and Nur&s;e of &s;o many eminent Mathematicians, and having long flou|ri&s;hed in Navigation, by the direction of the&s;e, and by the vicinity of the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> they could not be ignorant of the preci&s;e Latitude of their Country, and that from them <HI>Ptolemy</HI> might re|ceive
<PB N="88" REF="252">
a true information. Though it cannot be denied, but that <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> in places remoter from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> hath much erred. I &s;hall only in|&s;tance in our own Country, where he &s;ituates <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is <HI>London,</HI> in 54 degrees of Latitude, and the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the middle of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> (which in the printed Copies is fal&s;ly termed <GAP DESC="foreign">, but in the MSS rightly <GAP DESC="foreign">) in 52 de|grees, and 20 minutes of Latitude. Whereas <HI>London</HI> is certainly known to have for the Alti|tude of the Pole, or Latitude of the place, only 51 degrees and 32 minutes; and the middle of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight</HI> not to exceed 50 degrees, and &s;ome minutes.</P>
<P>But in my judgment <HI>Ptolemy</HI> is very excu&s;able in the&s;e and the like Errors, of &s;everal other places far di&s;tant from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &s;eeing he mu&s;t for their po&s;ition nece&s;&s;arily have depended ei|ther upon relations of Travellers, or Ob&s;ervati|ons of Mariners, or upon the Longitude of the day, mea&s;ured in tho&s;e times by <HI>Clep&s;ydrae</HI>; all which how uncertain they are, and &s;ubject unto Error, if &s;ome cele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations be not joyn|ed with them, and tho&s;e exactly taken with large In&s;truments, (in which kind the Ancients have not many, and our times, (excepting <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>Arabians</HI>) but a few) I &s;ay no man, that hath conver&s;ed with modern Travellers and Navigators, can be ignorant. Wherefore to excu&s;e the&s;e Errors of his (or ra|ther of others fathered by him) with a greater ab&s;urdity, by a&s;&s;erting the Poles of the World &s;ince his time to have changed their &s;ite, and con&s;equently all Countries their Latitudes, as <HI>Mariana</HI> the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Copernicus,</HI> and others after him have imagined; or el&s;e to charge <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> being &s;o excellent an Arti&s;t, with Ignorance,

and that even of his own Country, as <HI>Cluverius</HI> hath done, (from which my Ob&s;ervations at <HI>Alexandria</HI> and <HI>Memphis</HI> may vindicate him) the former were too great a &s;tupidity, and the latter too great a Pre&s;umption. But to return to <HI>Rhodes,</HI> an I&s;land (in <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>'s Comment upon <HI>Diony|&s;ius</HI>'s <GAP DESC="foreign">) of 920 furlongs circuit, where ac|cording to <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> the Parallel pa&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="foreign">, hath 36 degrees of Latitude, and &s;o hath <HI>Lindus,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> the chief Cities of the I&s;land; the &s;ame is confirmed by the MS, but where the printed Copy and <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> read <GAP DESC="foreign">, which <HI>Mercator</HI> renders <HI>Taly&s;&s;us,</HI> the MS renders <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Abulfeda</HI> in &s;ome Copies &s;ituates the I&s;land <HI>Rhodes,</HI> (for he mentions no Cities there) in the Latitude of 37 degrees and 40 minutes: And the Geography of <HI>Said Ibn Aly Algiorgany,</HI> commen|ded by <HI>Gilbertus Gaulmyn,</HI> in 37 degrees, if it be not by a tran&s;po&s;ition in the MS of the numerical Letters in <HI>Arabic,</HI> 37 for 36. which by rea&s;on of their &s;imilitude, are often confounded in <HI>Arabick</HI> MSS.

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the fir&s;t and faire&s;t <HI>Pyramid.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t and faire&s;t of the three greater <HI>Pyramids</HI> is &s;ituated on the top of a rocky Hill, in the Sandy De&s;art of <HI>Lybia,</HI> about a quar|ter of a mile di&s;tant to the We&s;t, from the Plains of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> above which the Rock ri&s;eth an hun|dred feet or better, with a gentle and ea&s;ie a&s;cent. Upon this advantageous Ri&s;e, and upon this &s;olid Foundation the <HI>Pyramid</HI> is erected; the heighth of the &s;ituation adding to the beauty of the Work, and the &s;olidity of the Rock giving the Super&s;tructure a permanent and &s;table &s;up|port. Each &s;ide of the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> computing it according to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> contains in length 800
<PB N="99" REF="257">
Graecian feet: And in <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> account 700 <HI>Strabo</HI> reckons it le&s;s than a furlong, that is le&s;s than 600 Graecian feet, or Six hundred twenty five Roman. And <HI>Pliny</HI> equals it to 883. That of <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> in my judgment, comes neare&s;t to the Truth, and may &s;erve in &s;ome kind to confirm tho&s;e proportions, which in another Di&s;cour&s;e I have a&s;&s;igned to the Grae|cian mea&s;ures: For mea&s;uring the North &s;ide of it, near the <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> by an exqui&s;ite <HI>radius</HI> of ten feet in length, taking two &s;everal &s;tations, as Mathematicians u&s;e to do, when any Ob&s;tacle hinders their approach, I found it to be Six hundred ninety three feet, according to the Engli&s;h Standard; which quantity is &s;omewhat le&s;s than that of <HI>Diodorus.</HI> The re&s;t of the &s;ides were <HI>examined</HI> by a line, for want of an even level and a convenient di&s;tance to place my In|&s;truments, both which the <HI>Area</HI> on the former &s;ide afforded.</P>
<P>The Altitude of this <HI>Pyramid</HI> was long &s;ince mea&s;ured by <HI>Thales Mile&s;ius,</HI> who according to <HI>Tatianus A&s;&s;yrius</HI> lived about the fiftieth Olym|piad, but his Ob&s;ervations is no where by the <HI>Ancients</HI> expre&s;&s;ed: Only <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us of a cour&s;e propo&s;ed by him, how it might be found, and that is by ob&s;erving &s;uch an hour, when the &s;ha|dow of the body is equal to its height. A way at the be&s;t, by rea&s;on of the faintne&s;s and &s;catte|ring of the extremity of the &s;hadow, in &s;o great an Altitude, uncertain, and &s;ubject unto Error. And yet <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> in the life of <HI>Thales,</HI> hath the &s;ame Story, from the Authority of <HI>Hieronymus. Hieronymus</HI> reports, That he mea|&s;ured the <HI>Pyramids</HI> by their &s;hadow, marking when they are of an equal quantity. Wherefore I &s;hall pa&s;s by his, and give my own Ob&s;ervati|ons.
<PB N="100" REF="258">
The Altitude is &s;omething defective of the Latitude; though in <HI>Strabo</HI>'s computation it exceeds; but <HI>Diodorus</HI> rightly acknowledges it to be le&s;s, which if we mea&s;ure by its perpendi|cular, is Four hundred eighty one feet; but if we take it as the <HI>Pyramid</HI> a&s;cends inclining (as all &s;uch Figures do) then it is equal, in re&s;pect of the lines &s;ubtending the &s;everal angles, to the Latitude of the <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> that is to &s;ix hundred nine|ty three feet.</P>
<P>What exce&s;&s;ive heighths &s;ome fancy to them|&s;elves, or borrow from the relations of others, I &s;hall not now examine. This I am certain of, that the <HI>Shaft or Spire</HI> of <HI>Pauls</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> before it was ca&s;ually burnt, being as much, or &s;ome|what more than the altitude of the Tower now &s;tanding (1647) did exceed the height of this <HI>Pyramid.</HI> For <HI>Cambden</HI> de&s;cribes it to have been in a perpendicular, five hundred and twenty feet from the Ground.</P>
<P>If we imagine upon the &s;ides of the <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> which is perfectly &s;quare, four equilateral trian|gles mutually propending, and enclining, till they all meet on high as it were in a point (for &s;o the top &s;eems to them which &s;tand below) then &s;hall we have a true notion of the ju&s;t dimen&s;ion and figure of this Pyramid: The <HI>Perimeter</HI> of each triangle comprehending two thou&s;and &s;e|venty nine feet (be&s;ides the Latitude of a little Plain, or Flat on the top) and the <HI>perimeter</HI> of the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> Two thou&s;and &s;even hundred &s;eventy two feet: Whereby the whole <HI>area</HI> of the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> (to proportion it to our mea&s;ures) contains four hundred eighty thou&s;and, two hundred forty nine &s;quare feet, or eleven Engli&s;h Acres of Ground, and 1089 of 43560 parts of an Acre. A proportion &s;o mon&s;trous, that if the Ancients
<PB N="101" REF="258">
did not atte&s;t as much, and &s;ome of them de|&s;cribe it to be more, this Age would hardly be induced to give credit to it. But <HI>Herodotus</HI> de|&s;cribing each &s;ide to contain eight hundred feet, the <HI>area</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be greater than that by me a&s;&s;igned, the &s;um amounting to &s;ix hun|dred and forty thou&s;and; or computing it as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> doth, the <HI>area</HI> will comprehend four hundred and ninety thou&s;and feet: And in the calculation of <HI>Pliny,</HI> if we &s;hall &s;quare eight hundred eighty three (which is the number al|lotted by him to the mea&s;ure of each &s;ide) the Product &s;even hundred &s;eventy nine thou&s;and &s;ix hundred eighty nine, will much exceed both that of <HI>Herodotus</HI> and this of <HI>Diodorus.</HI> Though certainly <HI>Pliny</HI> is much mi&s;taken, in a&s;&s;igning the mea&s;ure of the &s;ide to be eight hundred eighty three feet, and the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of the Pyramid to be but eight <HI>iugera,</HI> or Roman Acres: For if we take the Roman <HI>iugerum</HI> to contain in length two hundred and forty feet, and in breadth one hundred and twenty, as may be evidently pro|ved out of <HI>Varro,</HI> and is expre&s;ly affirmed by <HI>Quintilian,</HI> then will the <HI>&s;uperficies,</HI> or whole ex|tention, of the <HI>iugerum</HI> be equal to twenty eight thou&s;and eight hundred Roman feet; with which if we divide &s;even hundred &s;eventy nine thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred eighty nine, the re&s;ult will be twenty &s;even Roman <HI>iugera,</HI> and 2089 of 28800 parts of an Acre. Wherefore if we take tho&s;e numbers eight hundred eighty three of <HI>Pliny</HI> to be true, then I &s;uppo&s;e he writ twenty eight <HI>iugera,</HI> in&s;tead of eight, or el&s;e in his propor|tion of the &s;ide, to the <HI>area</HI> of the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> he hath erred.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="259">The a&s;cent to the top of the Pyramid is con|trived in this manner. From all the &s;ides with|out we a&s;cend by degrees; the lowermo&s;t de|gree is near four foot in height, and three in breadth. This runs about the Pyramid in a le|vel; and at the fir&s;t, when the Stones were en|tire, which are now &s;omewhat decay'd, made on every &s;ide of it a long but narrow Walk. The &s;econd degree is like the fir&s;t, each Stone amounting to almo&s;t four feet in height, and three in breadth; it retires inward from the fir&s;t near three feet, and this runs about the Pyramid in a level, as the former. In the &s;ame manner is the third row placed upon the &s;econd, and &s;o in order the re&s;t, like &s;o many Stairs ri&s;e one above another to the top. Which ends not in a point, as Mathematical Pyramids do, but in a little flat or &s;quare. Of this <HI>Herodotus</HI> hath no where left us the dimen&s;ions, but <HI>Henricus Ste|phanus,</HI> an able and de&s;erving man, in his Com|ment hath &s;upplied it for him; for he makes it to be eight <HI>orgyiae</HI>; where if we take the <HI>orgyia,</HI> as both <HI>He&s;ychius</HI> and <HI>Suidas</HI> do, for the di&s;tance between the Hands extended at length, that is for the fathom, or &s;ix feet, then &s;hould it be forty eight feet in breadth at the top. But the truth is, <HI>Stephanus,</HI> in this particular, whil&s;t he corrects the Errors of <HI>Valla</HI>'s Interpretation, is to be corrected him&s;elf; for that Latitude which <HI>Herodotus</HI> a&s;&s;igns to the admirable Bridge below (of which there is nothing now remaining) he hath carried up, by a mi&s;take, to the top of the Pyramid. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> comes nearer to the truth, who de&s;cribes it to be but nine feet. <HI>Pliny</HI> makes the breadth at the top to be twenty five feet, <HI>Altitudo</HI> (I would rather read it <HI>lati|tudo</HI>) <HI>&agrave; cacumine pedes</HI> 25. By my mea&s;ure it is

13 feet, and 280 of 1000 parts of the Engli&s;h foot. Upon this flat, if we a&s;&s;ent to the Opini|on of <HI>Proclus,</HI> it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>Aegy|ptian</HI> Prie&s;ts made their Ob&s;ervations in A&s;trono|my; and that from hence, or near this place, they fir&s;t di&s;covered, by the ri&s;ing of <HI>Sirius,</HI> their <HI>annus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Canicularis,</HI> as al&s;o their <HI>periodus Sothiaca,</HI> or <HI>annus magnus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>annus Helia|cus,</HI> or <HI>annus Dei,</HI> as it is termed by <HI>Cen&s;orinus,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 1400 &s;idereal years, in which &s;pace their <HI>Thoth Vagum,</HI> and <HI>fixum,</HI> came to have the &s;ame beginning. That the Prie&s;ts might near the&s;e Pyramids make their ob&s;ervations, I no way que&s;tion, this ri&s;ing of the Hill being, in my Judgment, as fit a place as any in <HI>Aegypt</HI> for &s;uch a de&s;ign, and &s;o much the fitter by the vicinity of <HI>Memphis.</HI> But that the&s;e Pyramids were de|&s;igned for Ob&s;ervatories, (whereas by the te&s;ti|monies of the Ancients I have proved before, that they were intended for Sepulchres) is no way to be credited upon the &s;ingle authority of <HI>Proclus.</HI> Neither can I apprehend to what pur|po&s;e the Prie&s;ts with &s;o much difficulty &s;hould a&s;cend &s;o high, when below with more ea&s;e, and as much certainty, they might from their own Lodgings hewn in the Rocks upon which the Pyramids are erected, make the &s;ame ob&s;erva|tions: For &s;eeing all <HI>Aegypt</HI> is but as it were one continued plain, they might from the&s;e Cliffs have, over the Plains of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as free and open a pro&s;pect of the Heavens, as from the tops of the Pyramids them&s;elves.

And therefore a right line extended from any part of the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> without, to the top, will equally touch the outward angle of every degree. Of the&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to take an exact mea&s;ure, &s;ince in &s;uch a revolution of time, if the inner parts of the Pyramid have not lo&s;t any thing of their fir&s;t perfection, as being not expo|&s;ed to the Injury of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Air of <HI>Aegypt</HI> is confe&s;&s;ed by the An|cients to be often full of Vapors; which ap|pears both by the great dews that hap|pen'd after the Deluge of <HI>Nilus</HI> for &s;everal months; as al&s;o in that I have di&s;covered at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in the Winter time, &s;everal ob&s;cure Stars in the con&s;tellation of <HI>&V;r&s;a major,</HI> not vi&s;ible in <HI>England</HI>; the which could not be di&s;cerned there, were there not a greater refraction at that time, than with us, and con&s;equently a greater conden&s;ation of the <HI>medium,</HI> or Air, as the Opticks demon&s;trate.</NOTE> <HI>Air,</HI> yet the outward parts, that is the&s;e degrees or rows of Stone, have been much wa&s;ted and impaired by both.

The relation of <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> is more admirable, who make the lea&s;t Stone in this Pyramid to be thirty feet. And this I can grant in &s;ome, yet &s;urely it can|not be admitted in all, unle&s;s we interpret their words, that the lea&s;t Stone is thirty &s;quare, or to &s;peak more properly, thirty cubical feet; which dimen&s;ion, or a greater, in the exteriour ones, I can without any difficulty admit. The number of the&s;e Steps is not mentioned by the Ancients, and that cau&s;ed me, and two that were with me, to be the more diligent in computing them, becau&s;e by modern Writers, and &s;ome of tho&s;e too of repute, they are de&s;cribed with much di|ver&s;ity and contrariety. The degrees, &s;aith <HI>Bellonius,</HI> are two hundred and fifty, each of them &s;ingle contains in height forty five digits, at the top it is two paces broad; for this I take to be the meaning of what <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI> renders thus: <HI>Aba&s;i autem ad cacumen ip&s;ius &s;upputationem facien|tes, comperimus circiter,</HI> 250 <HI>gradus, &s;inguli altitudi|nem habent</HI> 5 <HI>&s;olearum calcei</HI> 9 <HI>pollicum longitudinis, in fa&s;tigio duos pa&s;&s;us habet.</HI> Where I conceive his <HI>pa&s;&s;us</HI> is in the &s;ame &s;ence to be under&s;tood here above, as not long before he explains him|&s;elf in de&s;cribing the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> below, which in his account is 324 <HI>pa&s;&s;us paululum exten&s;is cruribus. Albertus Lewen&s;tainius</HI> reckons the Steps to be two hundred and &s;ixty, each of them a <HI>foot and a half</HI> in depth. <HI>Johannes Helfricus</HI> counts them to be two hundred and thirty. <HI>Seba&s;tianus Serlius,</HI> upon a relation of <HI>Grimano the</HI> Patriarch <HI>of Aqui|leia,</HI> and <HI>afterwards Cardinal,</HI> (who in his Travels in <HI>Aegypt</HI> mea&s;ured the&s;e degrees) computes
<PB N="106" REF="261">
them to be two hundred and ten, and the height of every &s;tep to be equally three palms and a half. It would be but lo&s;t labour to mention the different and repugnant relations of &s;everal others; that which by experience and by a di|ligent calculation I and two others found, is this, that the number of degrees from the bottom to the top, is two hundred and &s;even, though one of them in de&s;cending reckoned two hundred and eight.</P>
<P>Such as plea&s;e, may give credit to tho&s;e fabu|lous Traditions of &s;ome, That a Turki&s;h Archer &s;tanding at the top, cannot &s;hoot beyond the bottom, but that the Arrow will nece&s;&s;arily fall upon the&s;e &s;teps.

On high, as it were in the mid&s;t, between the &s;ides, there is a Stone that may be removed, which being taken out, there is an oblique (or &s;helving) en|trance</HI> (for &s;o I render that which by him is ter|med <GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>leading to the Tomb. Pliny</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;es nothing within, but only a <HI>Well</HI> (which is &s;till extant) of <HI>eighty &s;ix cubits in depth,</HI> to which he probably imagines, by &s;ome &s;ecret Aqueduct, the Water of the River <HI>Nilus</HI> to be brought. <HI>Ari|&s;tides</HI> in his Oration entituled <GAP DESC="foreign">, upon a mi&s;information of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts, makes the Foundation of the Structure to have de&s;cen|ded as far below, as the Altitude a&s;cends above. Of which I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity, &s;eeing all of them are founded upon Rocks; his words are the&s;e: <HI>Now as with admiration we behold the tops of the Pyramids, but that which is as much more under ground oppo&s;ite to it, we are ignorant of, (I &s;peak what I have received from the Prie&s;ts.)</HI> And this is that which hath been delivered to us by the An|cients,

which I was unwilling to pretermit, more out of reverence of Antiquity, than out of any &s;pecial &s;atisfaction. The <HI>Arabian</HI> Writers, e&s;pe|cially &s;uch as have purpo&s;ely treated of the Won|ders of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> have given us a more full de&s;cri|ption of what is within the&s;e Pyramids; but that hath been mix'd with &s;o many Inventions of their own, that the truth hath been darkned, and almo&s;t quite extingui&s;hed by them. Which Traditions of theirs are little better than a <HI>Ro|mance</HI>; and therefore leaving the&s;e, I &s;hall give a more true and particular de&s;cription out of mine own Experience and Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide a&s;cending thirty eight feet, upon an artificial bank of Earth, there is a &s;quare and narrow pa&s;&s;age leading into the Pyramid, through the mouth of which (being equidi&s;tant from the two &s;ides of the Pyramid) we enter as it were down the &s;teep of an Hill, declining with an angle of twenty &s;ix degrees. The breadth of this Entrance is exactly three feet, and 463 parts of 1000 of the Engli&s;h foot; the length of it beginning from the fir&s;t declivity, which is &s;ome ten palms without, to the utmo&s;t extremity of the Neck, or &s;treight within, where it contracts it &s;elf almo&s;t nine feet continued, with &s;carce half the depth it had at the fir&s;t en|trance, (though it keep &s;till the &s;ame breadth) is ninety two feet and an half. The Structure of it hath been the Labour of an exqui&s;ite Hand, as appears by the &s;moothne&s;s and evenne&s;s of the Work, and by the clo&s;e knitting of the Joynts; a Property long &s;ince ob&s;erved, and commended by <HI>Diodorus,</HI> to have run through the Fabrick of the whole Body of this Pyramid. Having pa&s;&s;ed with Tapers in our Hands this narrow Straight; though with &s;ome difficulty (for at the farther
<PB N="109" REF="262">
end of it we mu&s;t Serpent-like creep upon our Bellies) we land in a place &s;omewhat larger, and of a pretty height, but lying incompo&s;ed: Having been dug away, either by the curio&s;ity or avarice of &s;ome, in hope to di&s;cover an hid|den Trea&s;ure; or rather by the Command of <HI>Almamon,</HI> the de&s;ervedly renowned Calife of <HI>Babylon.</HI> By whom&s;oever it were, it is not worth the enquiry, nor doth the place merit de&s;cribing, but that I was unwilling to pretermit any thing, being only an Habitation for Batts, and tho&s;e &s;o ugly, and of &s;o large a-&s;ize, (exceeding a foot in length) that I have not el&s;ewhere &s;een the like. The length of this ob&s;cure and broken &s;pace containeth eighty nine feet, the breadth and height is various, and not worth con&s;ideration. On the left hand of this, adjoyning to that nar|row Entrance through which we pa&s;&s;ed, we climb up a &s;teep and ma&s;&s;y Stone, eight or nine feet in height, where we immediately enter up|on the lower end of the fir&s;t Gallery. The Pavement of this ri&s;es with a gentle acclivity, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mooth and poli&s;ht Marble, and where not &s;meared with Du&s;t and Filth, appea|ring of a white and alaba&s;ter colour; the Sides and Roof, as <HI>Titus Livius Burretinus,</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> an ingenious young man, who accompanied me thither, ob&s;erved, was of impoli&s;h'd Stone, not &s;o hard and compact as that on the Pavement, but more &s;oft and tender; the breadth almo&s;t five feet, and about the &s;ame quantity the height, if he have not mi&s;taken. He likewi&s;e di&s;cove|red &s;ome irregularity in the breadth, it opening a little wider in &s;ome places than in others; but this inequality could not be di&s;cerned by the eye, but only by mea&s;uring it with a careful Hand. By my ob&s;ervation with a Line, this
<PB N="110" REF="263">
Gallery contained in length an hundred and ten feet. At the end of this begins the &s;econd Gal|lery, a very &s;tately piece of work, and not in|feriour, either in re&s;pect of the curio&s;ity of Art, or richne&s;s of Materials, to the mo&s;t &s;umptuous and magnificent Buildings. It is divided from the former by a Wall, through which &s;tooping, we pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;quare hole, much about the &s;ame bigne&s;s as that by which we entred into the Py|ramid but of no con&s;iderable length. This nar|row pa&s;&s;age lyeth level, not ri&s;ing with an accli|vity, as doth the Pavement below and Roof above of both the&s;e Galleries. At the end of it, on the right hand, is the Well mentioned by <HI>Pliny,</HI> the which is circular, and not &s;quare, as the <HI>Arabian</HI> Writers de&s;cribe: The diameter of it exceeds three feet, the Sides are lined with white Marble, and the de&s;cent into it is by fa|&s;tening the Hands and Feet, in little open &s;paces, cut in the Sides within, oppo&s;ite and an&s;werable to one another in a perpendicular. In the &s;ame manner are almo&s;t all the Wells and Pa&s;&s;ages in|to the Ci&s;terns at <HI>Alexandria</HI> contrived, without Stairs or Windings, but only with inlets and &s;quare holes on each &s;ide within, by which, u&s;ing the Feet and Hands, one may with ea&s;e de&s;cend. Many of the&s;e Ci&s;terns are with open and double Arches, the lowermo&s;t Arch being &s;upported by a row of &s;peckled and <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble Pillars, upon the top of which &s;tands a &s;econd row, bearing the upper and higher Arch: The Walls within are covered with a &s;ort of Plai&s;ter for the colour white, but of &s;o durable a &s;ub&s;tance, that neither by time, nor by the water is it yet corrupted and impaired. But I return from the Ci&s;terns and Wells there to this in the Pyramid, which in <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Calculation is
<PB N="111" REF="263">
<HI>eighty &s;ix cubits in depth,</HI> and it may be was the pa&s;&s;age to tho&s;e &s;ecret Vaults mentioned, but not de&s;cribed by <HI>Herodotus,</HI> that were hewn out of the natural Rock, over which this Pyramid is erected. By my mea&s;ure &s;ounding it with a line, it contains twenty feet in depth. The rea&s;on of the difference between <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation and mine, I &s;uppo&s;e to be this, That &s;ince his time it hath almo&s;t been dammed up, and choaked with Rubbage, which I plainly di&s;covered at the bottom, by throwing down &s;ome combu&s;tible matter &s;et on fire. Leaving the Well, and going on &s;traight upon a level, the di&s;tance of fifteen feet, we entred another &s;quare pa&s;&s;age, opening again&s;t the former, and of the &s;ame bigne&s;s. The Stones are very ma&s;&s;y, and exqui&s;itely joynted, I know not whether of that gli&s;tering and &s;pec|kled Marble I mention'd in the Columns, of the Ci&s;terns at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This leadeth (run|ning in length upon a level an hundred and ten feet) into an arched Vault or little Chamber, which by rea&s;on it was of a Grave-like &s;mell, and half full of Rubbage, occa&s;ion'd my le&s;&s;er &s;tay. This Chamber &s;tands Ea&s;t and We&s;t&punc; the length of it is le&s;s than twenty feet, the breadth about &s;eventeen, and the height le&s;s than fif|teen. The Walls are entire, and plai&s;ter'd over with Lime; the Roof is covered with large &s;mooth Stones, not lying flat, but &s;helving and meeting above in a kind of Arch, or rather an Angle. On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this Room, in the middle of it, there &s;eems to have been a pa&s;&s;age leading to &s;ome other place, whither this way the Prie&s;ts went into the hollow of that huge <HI>Sphynx,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> term it, or <HI>Andro|&s;phynx,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> calls &s;uch kinds (being by <HI>Pliny</HI>'s calculation 102 feet in compa&s;s about the

Head, in height 62, in length 143, and by my ob&s;ervation made of one entire Stone) which &s;tands not far di&s;tant without the Pyramid, South-ea&s;t of it, or into any other private Re|tirement, I cannot determine; and it may be too this &s;erved for no &s;uch purpo&s;e, but rather as a <HI>Theca</HI> or <HI>Nicchio,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> &s;peak, wherein &s;ome Idol might be placed; or el&s;e for a piece of Ornament (for it is made of poli&s;h'd Stone) in the Architecture of tho&s;e times, which ours may no more under&s;tand than they do the rea&s;on of the re&s;t of tho&s;e &s;trange proportions that appear in the Pa&s;&s;ages and inner Rooms of this Pyramid. Returning back the &s;ame way we came, as &s;oon as we are out of this narrow and &s;quare pa&s;&s;age, we climb over it, and going &s;traight on, in the trace of the &s;econd Gallery, upon a &s;helving pavement (like that of the fir&s;t) ri&s;ing with an angle of twenty &s;ix degrees, we at length come to another partition. The length of the Gallery from the Well below to this partition above, is an hundred fifty and four feet; but if we mea|&s;ure the pavement of the floor, it is &s;omewhat le&s;s, by rea&s;on of a little vacuity (&s;ome fifteen feet in length) as we de&s;cribed before, between the Well and the &s;quare hole we climbed over. And here to rea&s;&s;ume &s;ome part of that, which hath been &s;poken, if we con&s;ider the narrow en|trance at the mouth of the Pyramid, by which we de&s;cend, and the length of the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond Galleries, by which we a&s;cend, all of them lying as it were in the &s;ame continued line, and leading to the middle of the Pyramid, we may ea&s;ily apprehend a rea&s;on of that &s;trange Eccho within, of four or five Voices, mentioned by <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his Fourth Book, <HI>De placitis philo&s;opho|rum</HI>; or rather of a long continued <HI>Sound,</HI> as
<PB N="113" REF="264">
I found by experience, di&s;charging a Mu&s;quet at the entrance; for the &s;ound being &s;hut in, and carried in tho&s;e clo&s;e and &s;mooth pa&s;&s;ages, like as in &s;o many Pipes or Trunks, finding no i&s;&s;ue out, reflects upon it &s;elf, and cau&s;es a con|fu&s;ed noi&s;e and circulation of the Air, which by degrees vani&s;hes, as the motion of it cea&s;es. This Gallery or <HI>Corridore</HI> (or what&s;oever el&s;e I may call it) is built of white and poli&s;h'd Marble, the which is very evenly cut in &s;pacious Squares or Tables. Of &s;uch Materials as is the Pavement, &s;uch is the Roof, and &s;uch are the Side-walls that flank it; the coagmentation, or knitting of the Joynts, is &s;o clo&s;e, that they are &s;carce di|&s;cernable by a curious Eye; and that which adds a grace to the whole Structure, though it makes the pa&s;&s;age the more &s;lippery and diffi|cult, is the acclivity and ri&s;ing of the A&s;cent. The height of this Gallery is 26 feet, the breadth is 6 feet, and 870 parts of the foot divided into a thou&s;and of which three feet, and 435 of 1000 parts of a foot, are to be allowed for the way, in the mid&s;t; which is &s;et, and bounded on both &s;ides with two banks (like Benches) of &s;leek and poli&s;h'd Stone; each of the&s;e hath one foot, 717 of 1000 parts of a foot in breadth, and as much in depth. Upon the top of the&s;e Benches, near the Angle, where they clo&s;e, and joyn with the Wall, are little &s;paces, cut in right angled pa|rallel Figures, &s;et on each &s;ide oppo&s;ite to one another, intended, no que&s;tion, for &s;ome other end than Ornament. In the ca&s;ting and ranging of the Marbles in both the Side-walls, there is one piece of Architecture, in my judgment very graceful, and that is, that all the cour&s;es or ran|ges, which are but &s;even, (&s;o great are tho&s;e Stones) do &s;et, and flag over one another about
<PB N="114" REF="265">
three inches, the bottom of the uppermo&s;t cour&s;e over&s;etting the higher part of the &s;econd, and the lower part of this overflagging the top of the third, and &s;o in order the re&s;t, as they de|&s;cend.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed this Gallery, we enter another &s;quare hole, of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with the former, which brings us into two <HI>anticamerette,</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> would call them, or <HI>Anticlo&s;ets,</HI> (give me leave in &s;o unu&s;ual a &s;tructure to frame &s;ome unu&s;ual terms) lined with a rich and &s;peckled kind of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble. The fir&s;t of the&s;e hath the dimen&s;ions almo&s;t equal to the &s;econd; the &s;econd is thus proportioned, the <HI>Area</HI> is level, the Figure of it is oblong, the one &s;ide containing &s;even feet, the other three and an half, the height is ten feet. On the Ea&s;t and We&s;t &s;ides, within two feet and an half of the top, which is &s;omewhat larger than the bottom, are three Cavities, or little Seats, in this man|ner,</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>This inner <HI>Anticlo&s;et</HI> is &s;eparated from the for|mer, by a Stone of red &s;peckled Marble, which hangs in two Mortices (like the leaf of a Sluce) between two Walls, more than three feet above the pavement, and wanting two of the Roof. Out of this Clo&s;et we enter another &s;quare hole, over which are five lines cut parallel and per|pendicular.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, I have not ob&s;erved any other Sculptures or Engravings in the whole Pyramid, and therefore it may ju&s;tly be wondred whence the <HI>Arabians</HI> borrowed tho&s;e vain Traditions I

before related, <HI>That all Sciences are in&s;cribed within in Hieroglyphicks.</HI> And as ju&s;tly it may be que|&s;tioned, upon what authority <HI>Dio,</HI> or his Epito|mizer <HI>Xiphilinus,</HI> reports that <HI>Cornelius Gallus</HI> (whom <HI>Strabo</HI> more truly names <HI>Aelius Gallus,</HI> with whom he travelled into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as a friend and companion) <HI>engraved in the Pyramids his Vi|ctories,</HI> unle&s;s we under&s;tand &s;ome other Pyra|mids not now exi&s;tent. This &s;quare pa&s;&s;age is of the &s;ame widene&s;s and dimen&s;ions as the re&s;t, and is in length near nine feet, (being all of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble, mo&s;t exqui&s;itely cut) which lands us at the North end of a very &s;umptuous and well proportion'd Room. The di&s;tance from the end of the &s;econd Gallery to this En|try, running upon the &s;ame level, is twenty four feet. This rich and &s;pacious Chamber, in which Art may &s;eem to have contended with Nature, the curious Work being not inferiour to the rich Materials, &s;tands as it were in the Heart and Center of the Pyramid, equidi&s;tant from all the Sides, and almo&s;t in the mid&s;t between the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> and the top. The Floor, the Sides, the Roof of it are all made of va&s;t and exqui&s;ite Ta|bles of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble, which if they were not vailed, and ob&s;cured by the &s;team of Tapers, would appear gli&s;tering and &s;hining. From the top of it de&s;cending to the bottom, there are but &s;ix ranges of Stone, all which being re&s;pectively &s;ized to an equal height, very gracefully in one and the &s;ame altitude, run round the Room. The Stones which cover this place are of a &s;trange and &s;tupendious length, like &s;o many huge beams lying flat, and traver&s;ing the Room, and withal &s;upporting the infinite ma&s;s and weight of the Pyramid above. Of the&s;e there are nine which cover the Roof, two of them are le&s;s by

<P>FROM this Pyramid we went to the &s;econd, being &s;carce di&s;tant the flight of an Arrow from it; where by the way I ob&s;erved, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the fir&s;t, the Ruines of a pile of Building, all of &s;quare and poli&s;hed Stone; &s;uch as <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Ba&s;altes,</HI> and de&s;cribes to be <HI>ferrei coloris, &amp; duritiae, of an Iron colour and hardne&s;s.</HI> Formerly it may be &s;ome Habitation of the Prie&s;ts, or &s;ome Monument of the Dead. To the right hand of this, tending to the South, &s;tands this &s;econd Pyramid, of which be&s;ides the Miracle, the Ancient and modern Writers, have delivered little. <HI>Herodotus</HI> relates, that <HI>Cephren,</HI> in imitation of his Brother <HI>Cheops,</HI> built this, but that he fell &s;hort in re&s;pect of the magnitude: <HI>For</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>we have mea&s;ured them.</HI> It were to be wi&s;hed, for fuller &s;atisfaction of the Reader, he had expre&s;&s;ed the quantity, and al&s;o the man|ner how he took his mea&s;ure. He adds, <HI>It hath no &s;ubterraneous Structures, neither is the</HI> Nilus <HI>by a Channel derived into it, as in the former. Diodorus</HI> &s;omewhat more particularly de&s;cribes it thus: That <HI>for the Architecture, it is like unto the former, but much inferiour to it in re&s;pect of magnitude: Each &s;ide of the Ba&s;is contains a &s;tadium in length.</HI> That is, to comment on his words, of Graecian
<PB N="122" REF="269">
feet &s;ix hundred, of Roman &s;ix hundred twenty five. So that by this computation, each &s;ide &s;hould want an hundred Graecian feet of the for|mer Pyramid. <HI>Pliny</HI> makes the difference to be greater, for a&s;&s;igning eight hundred eighty three feet to the former, he allows to the &s;ide of the Ba&s;is of this, but &s;even hundred thirty &s;even. By my ob&s;ervation, the Stones are of colour white, nothing &s;o great, and va&s;t, as tho&s;e of the fir&s;t and faire&s;t Pyramid; the &s;ides ri&s;e not with degrees like that, but are &s;mooth and equal, the whole Fabrick (except where it is oppo&s;ed to the South) &s;eeming very entire, free from any deformed Ruptures or Breaches. The height of it, taken by as deliberate a conjecture as I could make, (which it was ea&s;ie to do, by rea&s;on of the nearne&s;s of this and the former, being both upon the &s;ame Plain) is not inferiour to it; and therefore <HI>Strabo</HI> hath rightly judged them to be equal. The &s;ides al&s;o of the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of both are alike, as, be&s;ides the authority of <HI>Strabo,</HI> the Ve|netian Doctor a&s;&s;ured me, who mea&s;ured it with a line. There is no Entry leading into it, and therefore what may be within, whither &s;uch &s;paces and compartiments, as I ob&s;erv'd in the former, or whether different, or none, I mu&s;t leave to every mans private conjecture, and to the di&s;covery of after-times.</P>
<P>This is bounded on the North and We&s;t &s;ides, with two very &s;tately and elaborate pie|ces, which I do not &s;o much admire, as that by all Writers they have been pretermitted. About thirty feet in depth, and more than a thou&s;and and four hundred in length, out of the hard Rock the&s;e Buildings have been cut in a perpen|dicular, and &s;quared by the Che&s;&s;el, as I &s;uppo&s;e, for Lodgings of the Prie&s;ts. They run along at
<PB N="123" REF="269">
a convenient di&s;tance, parallel to the two &s;ides we mentioned of this Pyramid, meeting in a right angle, and making a very fair and graceful Pro&s;pect. The entrance into them is by &s;quare openings, hewn out of the Rock, much of the &s;ame bigne&s;s with tho&s;e I de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t Pyramid. Whether the&s;e were &s;ymbolical (as the Theology of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> con&s;i&s;ted much in my&s;terious figures) and the depre&s;&s;ure and lowns of the&s;e were to teach the Prie&s;ts humility, and the &s;quarene&s;s and evenne&s;s of them an uni|form and regular deportment in their actions, I leave to &s;uch as have written of their Hierogly|phicks to determine. The hollow &s;pace within of them all, is &s;omewhat like to a &s;quare and well-proportion'd <HI>Chamber,</HI> covered and arched above with the natural Rock: In mo&s;t of which, (as I remember) there was a pa&s;&s;age opening in|to &s;ome other compartiment, which the rubbage and darkne&s;s hindered me from viewing. On the North &s;ide without I ob&s;erved a line, and on|ly one, engraven with &s;acred and <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Characters, &s;uch as are mentioned by <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Diodorus,</HI> to have been u&s;ed by the Prie&s;ts, and were different from the vulgar characters in civil Affairs: In which former kind <HI>Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr</HI> makes <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to have been skilful, as the Scri|pture makes him to have been learned in all the wi&s;dom of the <HI>Aegyptians.</HI> The&s;e ran not down|wards, as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> in our times write, but were continued in a &s;treight line, as we u&s;e to write: And are to be read (if any under&s;tand tho&s;e my|&s;terious Sculptures) by proceeding from the right hand to the left, and as it were imitating the motion and cour&s;e of the Planets: For &s;o <HI>Herodotus</HI> expre&s;ly informs us, That the <HI>Graecians</HI> write and ca&s;t account, going from the left hand

<P>It will be in vain to repeat the Traditions and De&s;criptions of &s;everal others; all which by a kind of Confederacy agree in the &s;ame Tale for the &s;ub&s;tance, only differing in &s;ome circum|&s;tances: So that I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect that <HI>Diodorus</HI> hath borrowed mo&s;t of his Relation from <HI>Hero|dotus</HI>; and <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> from <HI>Diodorus,</HI> or from them both; and the more learned Neote|ricks from them all. For el&s;e how can it be ima|gined they &s;hould &s;o con&s;tantly agree in that, which if my Eyes and Memory extreamly fail me not, is mo&s;t evidently fal&s;e? And there|fore I have a &s;trong jealou&s;ie, that they never came near this third Pyramid; but that they did, as I have ob&s;erved all Travellers in my time in <HI>Aegypt</HI> to do, fill them&s;elves &s;o full, and as it were &s;o &s;urfeit with the &s;ight of the greater and fairer Pyramid, that they had no Appetite to be Spectators of the re&s;t, where they &s;hould only &s;ee the &s;ame Miracle (for the Pyramids are all of the &s;ame figure) the farther they went, de|crea&s;ing, and pre&s;ented as it were in a le&s;s Vo|lume. Or if they did view this, it was <HI>qua&s;i per tran&s;ennam,</HI> very perfunctorily and &s;lightly; and that through a fal&s;e and coloured Gla&s;s; for they have mi&s;taken both in the quality of the Stone and colour of the Pyramid. I begin with <HI>Hero|dotus,</HI> who by a notable piece of Forgetfulne&s;s, if it be not a <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the Copies, makes the dimen&s;ions of each of the &s;ides, in the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of this, to be three hundred feet, and yet want but twenty of the fir&s;t Pyramid, to which he a&s;&s;ign|ed before eight hundred feet; an Impo&s;&s;ibility in Arithmetick; and therefore it will be no
<PB N="126" REF="271">
Pre&s;umption to correct the place, and in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="foreign">, to write <GAP DESC="foreign">. I know not how to palliate or excu&s;e his other Error, where he makes this Pyramid to be built as far as to the middle of it, with <HI>Aethio|pick</HI> Marble. If this &s;ort of Marble be <HI>ferrei colo|ris,</HI> as it is de&s;cribed by <HI>Pliny,</HI> and granted by <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> both of them expre&s;&s;ing the colour to be black, and the latter bringing it from the remote&s;t Mountains of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> where the Marble hath the &s;ame Tincture and Colour with the Inhabitants, then can this relation of <HI>Herodotus</HI> no way be admitted; for the whole Pyramid &s;eems to be of clear and white Stone, &s;omewhat choicer and brighter than that in ei|ther of the two other Pyramids. And therefore I wonder that <HI>Diodorus, Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> and among&s;t latter Authors <HI>Bellonius, Gillius,</HI> and &s;eve|ral others, &s;hould have all follow'd <HI>Herodotus,</HI> when with a little pains and circum&s;pection, they might have reformed his, and their own errour. It may perhaps be alledged in their defence, that they mean the Buildings within are erected with black and <HI>Aethiopick</HI> Marble; and yet if this be granted, &s;ince there is no entrance leading into this, no more than is into the &s;econd Pyramid, what may be within depends upon the uncertain|ty of Tradition or Conjecture, both which are very fallible; though it cannot be denied, but that clo&s;e by this, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of it, there are the ruines of a Pile of Building, with a &s;ad and dusky colour, much like that we de&s;cribed in pa&s;&s;ing to the &s;econd Pyramid, which might be the ground and occa&s;ion of this Error. I cannot excu&s;e the Ancients, but <HI>Bellonius</HI> or <HI>Gillius</HI> (for it is no matter which of them owns the relation, when both of them have erred) are far more

<Q>They carried up the re&s;t of the Stones with little Engines made of Wood, rai&s;ing them from the ground upon the fir&s;t row: When the Stone was lodged upon this row, it was put into another Engine, &s;tanding upon the fir&s;t &s;tep, from thence it was conveyed to the &s;econd row by another: For &s;o many rows and orders of Steps as there were, &s;o many Engines were there; or el&s;e they removed the Engine, which was one, and ea&s;ie to be carried, to eve|ry particular row, as often as they moved a Stone. We will relate that which is &s;poken of either part; therefore tho&s;e in the Pyramid were fir&s;t made, which were the highe&s;t, then by degrees the re&s;t, la&s;t of all, tho&s;e which are neare&s;t to the Ground, and are the lowe&s;t.</Q>
The fir&s;t part of this Solution of <HI>Herodotus</HI> is full of difficulty. How in the <HI>erecting</HI> and <HI>placing</HI> of &s;o many <HI>machinae,</HI> charged with &s;uch ma&s;&s;y Stones, and tho&s;e continually pa&s;&s;ing over the lower degrees, could it be avoided, but that they mu&s;t either un&s;ettle them, or endanger the
<PB N="130" REF="273">
breaking of &s;ome Portions of them; which mu|tilations would have been like Scars in the Face of &s;o magnificent a Building? His &s;econd An|&s;wer is the &s;ounder; but I conceive the Text to be imperfect. <HI>Diodorus</HI> hath another Fancy:
<Q>The Stones (&s;aith he) at a great di&s;tance off were prepared in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and they report, that by the help of <HI>Aggeres</HI> (Engines not being then invented) the Work was erected. And that which begets the greate&s;t admiration is, that &s;o va&s;t a Structure was perfected in that place, which is all about repleni&s;hed with Sand, where there appears not any Relicks ei|ther of the Aggeres, or of the hewing and po|li&s;hing of the Stones: So that it &s;eems not piecemeal by the Indu&s;try of Men, but altoge|ther, and at once, the whole pile, as it were by &s;ome God, was erected in the mid&s;t of the Sands. Some of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> relate Wonders of it, and endeavour to obtrude I know not what Fables, namely, That the&s;e Aggeres con|&s;i&s;ting of Salt and Nitre, were di&s;&s;olved by let|ting in the River, which wholly con&s;umed them without the labour of Hands, leaving this Structure (entire.) But the truth of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s is not &s;o, but that tho&s;e multitudes of men which were employed in rai&s;ing the Aggeres, carried them away unto their former places: For as they report three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and men were employed in the&s;e Offices, and the whole Work was &s;carce fini&s;hed in the &s;pace of twenty years.</Q>
<HI>Pliny</HI> partly agrees with him, and partly gives another An&s;wer: <HI>The que|&s;tion is, by what means the Cement is conveyed up to &s;uch a height</HI> (he rather might have que&s;tion'd how tho&s;e va&s;t Stones were conveyed up) <HI>&s;ome &s;ay, that banks of Nitre and Salt were made up as
<PB N="131" REF="273">
the Work ro&s;e, which being fini&s;hed, they were wa&s;hed away by the River</HI> (Nilus.) <HI>Others imagine that Bridges were made with Brick; which, the Work being ended, were di&s;tributed into private Hou&s;es: for they conceive that the</HI> Nilus <HI>being much lower, could not come to wa&s;h them</HI> (away.) If I may a&s;&s;ume the liberty of a Traveller, I imagine that they were erected, neither as <HI>Herodotus</HI> de&s;cribes, nor as <HI>Diodorus</HI> reports, nor as <HI>Pliny</HI> relates, but that fir&s;t they made a large and &s;pacious Tower in the mid&s;t reaching to the top; to the &s;ides of this Tower, I conceive, the re&s;t of the Building to have been applied, piece after piece, like &s;o many Buttre&s;&s;es or Supporters, &s;till le&s;&s;ening in height, till at la&s;t they came to the lowermo&s;t degree. A difficult piece of building taken in the be&s;t, and ea&s;ie&s;t projection; and therefore it is no wonder, if it were not often imitated by the Ancients, and no where expre&s;&s;ed or com|mended by the great Ma&s;ter of Architecture <HI>Vi|truvius.</HI> Yet &s;urely if we judge of things by the events, and if we reflect upon the intention of Monuments, which are rai&s;ed by the Living, to perpetuate the Memory of the Dead, then is this as commendable a way as any. And there|fore we &s;ee at <HI>Rome,</HI> that though by the revo|lution of &s;o many Ages the <HI>Mau&s;oleum</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> be almo&s;t decayed, and the <HI>Septizonium</HI> of <HI>Seve|rus</HI> be utterly lo&s;t, both intended for la&s;ting and &s;tately Sepulchres, yet the Pyramid of C. <HI>Cae&s;tius</HI> &s;tands fair and almo&s;t entire; which is no more to be compared, either for the va&s;tne&s;s of the Stones or the whole bulk and fabrick of it, with the&s;e, than are the limbs and body of a Dwarf to the dimen&s;ions of a Gyant, or &s;ome large <HI>Colo&s;&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="274">I have done with the Work, but the Artizans de&s;erve not to be pretermitted; concerning whom the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Diodorus</HI> is as true, as it is boldly delivered by him.

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> Pyramids, Sphynx, Mum|mies, &amp;c. By Father <HI>Van&s;leb,</HI> and others.</HEAD>
<P>IN my fir&s;t Voyage to <HI>Aegypt</HI> I had &s;een the <HI>Pyramids,</HI> but having another opportunity offer'd to me, I went thither to view again the&s;e rare Monuments of Antiquity, to &s;ee whether I might not ob&s;erve &s;omething more than I have taken notice of in my fir&s;t Relation.</P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>April</HI> I went thither, in the company of the French Con&s;ul, and many other Merchants, and with almo&s;t all his Hou&s;hold: We had with us three <HI>Janizaries</HI> to guard us, &s;o that we were in all about fifty Cavaliers well mounted upon A&s;&s;es, taking with us Provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for three days.</P>
<P>When we were come to the <HI>Pyramids,</HI> and had ob&s;erv'd exactly every thing, I took notice that the place where they &s;tood was a Burying-place.
<PB N="135" REF="275">
This is plain to any that &s;ee the place; and doubtle&s;s it was the Burying-place of the old City <HI>Memphis</HI>; for all the <HI>Arabian</HI> Hi&s;tories in|form us, that this City &s;tood where the <HI>Pyramids</HI> now are, over again&s;t old <HI>Cairo.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I took notice, that all the <HI>Pyramids</HI> have an entrance that leads to a low Alley, which is very long, and at the end is a Chamber, where the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> did place the Bodies of tho&s;e Per&s;ons for whom the <HI>Pyramids</HI> were built. This Entrance is not to be &s;een in every one of the <HI>Pyramids,</HI> becau&s;e the Wind hath &s;topt them with Sand. I &s;aw upon &s;ome of them &s;ome Hieroglyphick Characters, but I had not time to write them out.</P>
<P N="3">3. I took notice, that all the <HI>Pyramids</HI> were built in very good order; and that each of the three greate&s;t were at the head of ten le&s;&s;er, which are not well to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, becau&s;e of the heaps of Sand: One may yet imagine, to &s;ee the place, that in former Ages there have been here one hundred <HI>Pyramids</HI> little and great.</P>
<P N="4">4. I took notice, that they are all built upon an even Rock covered over with white Sand; &s;o that it is very probable that the Stones have been taken from the place, and not brought from far, as &s;ome Travellers imagin, and old Writers, for the greate&s;t is nothing but a Rock cut as a Pyramid, and covered over with a Wall of Stone.</P>
<P N="5">5. I took notice, that of all the Stones of the greate&s;t there is &s;carce one entire, but either worn out with the Weather and Time, or broken by &s;ome other Accident; &s;o that though one may a&s;cend on all &s;ides to the top, yet not in all places with the &s;ame ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="136" REF="276">6. I have taken notice, that none of the <HI>Py|ramids</HI> are alike, or perfectly &s;quare, but that all have two &s;ides longer than the others. I inten|ded to mea&s;ure the greate&s;t; for that purpo&s;e I had with me a String of about thirty Land-yards; but becau&s;e the Winds have heap'd about it Mountains of Sand, I could not po&s;&s;ibly draw a line &s;trait from one angle to the other.</P>
<P>On the 28th day of <HI>December</HI> I went to &s;ee the <HI>Pyramids</HI> the third time, with &s;ome Strangers. In our way we were mightily troubled with a very thick Mi&s;t, which la&s;ted till ten a clock in the morning; and we found a great deal of Mud in the Trenches and Ditches, which was not yet dry &s;ince the retreat of the River, &s;o that we were carried over upon the <HI>Moors</HI> backs that were with us.</P>
<P>At this time I went up to the top of the great <HI>Pyramid,</HI> and I ob&s;erv'd, as at the fir&s;t, that the place where the <HI>Pyramids</HI> &s;tand is a pure Rock, cover'd over with white Sand, which appears &s;ufficiently by the Ditches and Caves round about the <HI>Pyramids</HI> cut in the Rock.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Rock is to be &s;een, upon which &s;tands the greate&s;t <HI>Pyramid,</HI> by a hole at one of the Angles, between the Ea&s;t and the North &s;ides.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Pyramids</HI> are not built with Marble, as &s;ome &s;ay, but with a white Sandy Stone very hard.</P>
<P N="4">4. The greate&s;t hath but two hundred and &s;ix &s;teps; and though Mon&s;ieur <HI>Th.</HI> &s;aith that it hath two hundred and eight, this proceeds from his not taking notice that two &s;teps are broken into four.</P>
<P N="5">5. On the top of the greate&s;t <HI>Pyramid</HI> there was anciently a Statue or <HI>Colo&s;&s;e.</HI> This appears, becau&s;e it is not &s;harp as the others, but plain:
<PB N="137" REF="276">
And there are yet to be &s;een great Pits, which were to keep fa&s;t the <HI>Colo&s;&s;e</HI> from falling.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there is nothing on the top but ma|ny Letters of the Names of Per&s;ons of all Nati|ons, who have left them to witne&s;s that they had been there. There is no &s;ign of the Play at <HI>Mancala,</HI> which a <HI>Coptie</HI> told me was there im|printed in the days of the <HI>Pharaohs.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Stones of the bigge&s;t <HI>Pyramid</HI> are not equal, for &s;ome of the undermo&s;t are four foot high, &s;ome three foot and an half, and five foot long. The Stones of the middle are three foot and five inches high, and the uppermo&s;t Stones are but two foot high, and three and an half long.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;ides of the Pyramids are not equal; for in the greate&s;t it is vi&s;ible, and &s;o in the others, that the North &s;ide is longer than that which &s;tretches from Ea&s;t to We&s;t.</P>
<P N="8">8. In all the Pyramids there are very deep Wells cut in the Rock, &s;quare; as I have &s;een in more than ten.</P>
<P>On the 26th day of <HI>June</HI> I went the fourth time to &s;ee the <HI>Pyramids,</HI> in the company of Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Sabatery</HI> Vice-Con&s;ul of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>In the pa&s;&s;age to old <HI>Cairo,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the River, I took notice of one thing very re|markable in its Channel; the Water was perfect|ly green, as a Cake covered over with green Gra&s;s. This was the fir&s;t time that I &s;aw it of this colour; which cau&s;ed me to ask of the Boat|men what this green colour was: They told me, that the River <HI>Nilus</HI> did then putrifie, that it had continued &s;o fifteen days, and would be &s;o five more. Some of them &s;aid, that there was none could remember to have &s;een the River &s;o green as that year, 1672.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="277">To return again to the Pyramids, I went up this time to the top of the highe&s;t Pyramid, I enter'd into the Chamber, but &s;aw no new thing which could cau&s;e me either to change or add to my former Ob&s;ervations. It is needle&s;s to &s;peak of its Dimen&s;ions, &s;eeing &s;o many Travel|lers have already publi&s;h'd them, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thevenot</HI> in his <HI>Levant</HI> Travels.</P>
<P>From the Pyramids we went to take a view of the Caves that are adjoyning. There are many, all cut in the &s;ide of a Rock; their out|&s;ides are out of order, without any proportion, but their in&s;ide very equal and poli&s;h'd. In eve|ry one there is a deep Well &s;quare, cut in the Rock, where the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did put the Body of that per&s;on, for whom the Cave was made; for it was their Sepulchre. The Walls of many of the&s;e Caves are full of Hieroglyphick Figures, carved in the Rock. In &s;ome they are but &s;mall, in others very lively. In one I number'd &s;ixteen great Figures, that repre&s;ented eight Men and eight Women, holding one another by the hands, with many other &s;mall Figures or Shapes, on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The great Pyramid is 520 foot high upon a Ba&s;e of 682 foot &s;quare: The Platform at top is 16 foot and two thirds &s;quare, and is compos'd of 12 large Stones, yet this from below appears to the Eye a &s;harp point. A &s;trong man cannot throw a Stone from the top, &s;o as to make it fall beyond the Steps or Ba&s;is of the Pyramid.</P>

<P><HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, that it was the Tomb of King <HI>Ama&s;is.</HI> I imagine that this <HI>Sphynx</HI> was a Sepul|chre, but we cannot under&s;tand that it belong'd to <HI>Ama&s;is</HI>; for all the Records and Traditions of this <HI>Sphynx</HI> are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>That it is a Tomb may appear, fir&s;t by its &s;i|tuation, which is in a place which was in former Ages a Burying-place; and near the <HI>Pyramids</HI> and mortuary Caves. Secondly, it is to be ima|gined that it was a Sepulchre from its building. In the hinder part is a Cave under ground, of a bigne&s;s an&s;werable to that of the Head, into which I have look'd by an entrance that leads into it, &s;o that it could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, but to keep a dead Corps.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Franks</HI> have, out of an exce&s;s of curio|&s;ity, climb'd up by the means of Rope-Ladders, to &s;ee whether this Head was hollow or ma&s;&s;y, and they have found it to be hollow, but filled at pre&s;ent with Sand.</P>
<P>The Neck is worn out round about, which cau&s;eth men to imagine that it will not be able to &s;upport the weight of that great Head.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Wells where the <HI>Mummies</HI> are.</HEAD>
<P>WHen we had fully viewed this <HI>Sphynx,</HI> we took the Road that leads to <HI>Saccara,</HI> a Village, at four hours travelling from the <HI>Pyra|mids,</HI> and about eight from <HI>Cairo</HI> towards the South. The Burying-place of the <HI>Mummies</HI> is near adjoyning to this Village.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e it was very late, and that we were to agree with the <HI>Arabians</HI> of the Village about the Price, the Number and Quality of the Wells, that they were to open for us, we &s;topt there all night, and the next morning we took with us twelve Hor&s;emen, to guard us, of the <HI>Arabians</HI>; with them we went to this Burying-place, where the <HI>Mummies</HI> are in Caves under ground.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Well that we &s;aw was that of Birds embalmed: When we had cau&s;ed the Sand that &s;tops the Wells mouth to be removed, through which we were to go down, and from thence to enter into the Cave, we cau&s;ed our &s;elves to be let down one after another, by tying a double Rope about our middles. As &s;oon as we were at the bottom, and that every one had lighted his Taper, and &s;everal Matches that we had brought, we went into the Cave creeping upon our Bellies. The Cave is an Alley in the Rock, about the height of a Man, and about the breadth of a Perch, and of an extraordinary length. We found there many other Alleys on both hands, cut in the Rock, where were many large Stores, full of earthen Pots, covered over with Coverings of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. In the&s;e Pots
<PB N="141" REF="278">
were embalmed Birds of all kinds, every Bird in its own Pot. And as I thought that the remem|brance of a Cu&s;tom &s;o ancient and &s;uper&s;titious was worthy of our notice, I brought about half a dozen with me, &s;ome I have &s;ent to the Kings Library. We found al&s;o &s;ome Hens-Eggs empty, but entire, without any ill &s;mell or crack.</P>
<P>When we had viewed &s;ufficiently this Cave, we returned up in the &s;ame manner that we went down, and found another open'd, called the <HI>Virgin,</HI> which is that was never open'd before. According to our Orders to the <HI>Arabians,</HI> Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Tiger</HI> and the others went down in the &s;ame manner as into the former, I alone could not follow them, becau&s;e of a <HI>Quartan</HI> Fever, which had troubled me fourteen months, and took me at that very moment; but I lo&s;t nothing by that; for the&s;e Gentlemen told me at their re|turn, that they found an horrid &s;tench, and a clo&s;e air, that put out their Cand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and their Matches al&s;o, every time that they endeavour'd to light them, which cau&s;ed them to get up again without entring further. They told me that this Well was much deeper than the for|mer.</P>
<P>We cau&s;ed another to be opened, which was not a Virgin Well, as the former, becau&s;e it was not &s;o deep. I ventur'd into that, notwith&s;tan|ding my indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P><PB N="142" REF="279">We went down next into a Cave, called, <HI>The Church,</HI> which was not &s;o deep as the former.

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of an entire Body of <HI>a</HI> Mummy.</HEAD>
<P>THis was a long and large Body, in a very thick Coffin of Wood, &s;hut clo&s;e on all hands; the Timber was not at all rotten, and we found it to be Sycamore-wood, which in <HI>Egypt</HI> they call <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Fig-tree, that does not rot &s;o &s;oon as other Wood. Upon the Coffin the Face of him that was within it, was cut in embo&s;&s;ed Work. Some Coffins there are al&s;o of Stone, with the Face of the per&s;on within, cut in Bo&s;s, and Hieroglyphicks all along the length of it. There are two of the&s;e Stones in the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fouquet</HI> at St. <HI>Mande,</HI> and I had two of them al&s;o, of which one was broken at <HI>Ale|xandria,</HI> and the other I brought home with me very whole, which weighs betwixt &s;even and eight hundred weight. Some of the&s;e <HI>Coffins</HI> are made of &s;everal pieces of <HI>Cloth</HI> pa&s;ted together, which are as &s;trong as the wooden ones. I have one of this kind in my Clo&s;et, made of above forty Cloths glewed or pa&s;ted together in thick|ne&s;s, which are not in the lea&s;t rotten; it is co|vered
<PB N="145" REF="280">
all over with Idols and Hieroglyphicks, painted on a very thin Plai&s;ter, with which the out&s;ide Cloth is daubed over, but it is a little &s;poil'd, the Plai&s;ter in &s;ome places being rubbed off. Among the&s;e Figures there is a Compart|ment at the lower end, two inches broad, and a foot long, being painted cro&s;s-ways over the Coffin, wherein may be &s;een the manner how the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> embalmed dead Bodies. In the middle of this Compartment there is a long Table &s;haped like a Lion, on the back of which the Body that is to be embalmed is laid at length, and hard by there is a Man with a Knife in his Hand opening the Body; this man hath on a Vizard Mask, &s;haped like the Beak of a Sparrow-hawk, which (without doubt) was the Cu&s;tom of their Embalmers, who made u&s;e of that kind of Mask, that they might not breath in the Corruption that might evaporate from the dead Bodies, as the Phy&s;icians of <HI>Italy</HI> do at pre|&s;ent, who in time of a Plague never &s;tir abroad without a Mask of this kind, in the long No&s;e of which they put Perfumes; though I make no doubt, but the Mask I &s;peak of is the Head of <HI>O&s;iris,</HI> which the <HI>Egyptians</HI> repre&s;ented with the Head of a Sparrow-hawk, as they did <HI>Anubis</HI> with the Head of a Dog, the <HI>Nile</HI> with a Lyons Head, <HI>&amp;c</HI> But as a &s;urer mark that it is an em|balming, there are four Ve&s;&s;els without Handles upon the afore&s;aid Table, which could be no|thing el&s;e but the Ve&s;&s;els wherein the nece&s;&s;ary Drugs were kept not only for the embalming, as <HI>Balm, Cedria, &amp;c.</HI> but al&s;o for the wrapping up and incru&s;tation of the Body, as <HI>Bitumen</HI> and others: By the &s;ides of the Table there are &s;eve|ral Per&s;ons &s;tanding and &s;itting in divers po&s;tures.
<PB N="146" REF="281">
Within this Coffin is the figure of a naked Maid with her Arms &s;tretched out.</P>
<P>But to return to my fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e. This Wooden Coffin I mentioned being broken to pieces with Hatchets, we found an entire Body in it, which lay in this manner. The Face was covered (as commonly all the re&s;t are) with a kind of Head-piece of Cloth fitted with Plai&s;ter, on which the Countenance of that per&s;on was repre&s;ented in Gold, and when we took off the Helmet, we found nothing of the Face remain|ing, which is commonly reduced to A&s;hes; I be|lieve it is, becau&s;e it will not admit of gumming &s;o well as the other parts of the Body. How|ever, I brought to <HI>Paris</HI> the Head of a <HI>Mummy</HI> whole and entire, but it is all covered with Fil|lets of Cloth, &s;o neatly fitted, that they hinder not, but one may &s;ee the &s;hape of the Eyes, No&s;e, and Mouth. The re&s;t of the Body was &s;wathed with little Bands of Cloth very neatly made, but wrapped about with &s;o many ca&s;ts and turnings, that I believe there were above a thou&s;and Ells in it; and certainly it is &s;o rare a way of Swa|thing and Binding, that I think it cannot be imitated at pre&s;ent, as many Chyrurgions have acknowledged to me. Along the Brea&s;t and Belly there was a Band of Cloth <HI>three</HI> good Fin|gers broad, and a large foot and a half long, it was fa&s;tened to the other Bands, and upon it were &s;everal Hieroglyphicks done in Gold. I took this Writing, and folded it, that I might the more conveniently carry it up with me. I hoped to have found Idols in that Coffin, know|ing that they interred many with their Dead, either of Stone, Copper, or Green Earth, as I have &s;everal that have been found in the&s;e Bo|dies,
<PB N="147" REF="281">
but finding none, I thought there might be &s;ome within his Body; for after they had em|boweled them, they often enclo&s;ed Idols within their Bellies; for that end I had it bro|ken up, but we could find nothing. I con&s;ide|red then that Balm which is now quite lo&s;t, it is black, hard, and &s;hines like Pitch, having much &s;uch a &s;mell, but more plea&s;ant, that kept Bodies entire, and (I believe) the Sand contributed not a little thereto, for even in the greate&s;t De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> &s;ometimes the dead Bodies of Men and Dogs are found entire, who falling a&s;leep, and &s;taying behind the Caravans, are covered over with an ocean of Sand driven by the high Winds, in which the Bodies being buried, are by the dryne&s;s and &s;alt that is in the Sand, which drys up all the humidity of them, pre&s;erved en|tire, and are afterwards found, when another Wind blowing, carries off the Sand again. Many think that the Bodies &s;o dryed, are the true <HI>Mummy</HI>; it is a mi&s;take, and that which Merchants bring into <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> to be u&s;ed in Medicine, is the <HI>Mummy</HI> we fir&s;t de&s;cribed. Near the Room I went into there were &s;everal others full of Bodies, but &s;eeing the entries into them were full of Sand, I called to them above to pull me up again with the &s;ame Rope, with which I was let down, being much di&s;&s;atisfied with my <HI>Moors,</HI> who had open'd &s;o &s;orry a Pit for me. When I was got up I looked upon my Cloth, whereon were Characters of Gold, but was much vexed to &s;ee that all the Letters di&s;ap|peared, and that by my own fault, becau&s;e I had folded it together when it was very humid, and &s;o all the Gold and Paint &s;tuck to the oppo&s;ite &s;ides; whereas I &s;hould have brought it up open and dryed it in the Sun. But I have others that
<PB N="148" REF="282">
are finer, which are only a little &s;poiled in the bringing. I brought with me al&s;o &s;ome Hands of <HI>Mummies,</HI> which are as entire at pre&s;ent as ever they were. I had al&s;o the good fortune to buy upon the place &s;ome Idols, of the <HI>Moors,</HI> who come and &s;ell them to the <HI>Franks</HI> in the City. The&s;e Idols are of &s;everal &s;orts, and in many po&s;tures, there are of them of Copper, of &s;everal &s;orts of Stone, and &s;everal &s;orts of Earth al&s;o; at lea&s;t, I have &s;ome of all the&s;e kinds, all which I am very &s;ure have been taken out of <HI>Mummies,</HI> and cannot be &s;aid to be coun|terfeit, for be&s;ides that, they have not the Art to do it, they &s;ell them at &s;o ea&s;ie a rate, that the very Materials are worth more. This is all I could ob&s;erve of the Pyramids and Mummies: And hence it appears, that the ancient <HI>Egyptians</HI> &s;pent more in their Tombs than during their whole Lives; and one rea&s;on they gave for that was, That their Hou&s;es were only for living a &s;hort time in, and their Tombs the Palaces that were to be inhabited by their Souls for many Ages. Not far from the&s;e <HI>Mummies,</HI> towards the <HI>Nile,</HI> are &s;ome remains of a large Town, which was <HI>Memphis,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof were bu|ried there, the Ancients never burying their Dead within Towns, for fear of infecting the Air, none but Chri&s;tians (who mind not that) bury their Dead any where. Now, to prove that the&s;e great Ruins are the remains of <HI>Memphis, Pliny</HI> affirms it, when he &s;ays, that the Pyramids are betwixt the <HI>Delta</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> and the City of <HI>Memphis</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>Africa.</HI> At length we re|turned by old <HI>Caire,</HI> and &s;aw all that is curious, or worth being &s;een in it.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>Dublin,</HI> concerning the Porphyry Pillars <HI>in</HI> Egypt. <HI>By Dr.</HI> Huntingdon.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU engage me after a very undeniable manner, as I perceive by the minutes of your Philo&s;ophical <HI>Society,</HI> to &s;end you &s;ome account of the <HI>Porphyry Pillars</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI>; and though I could have &s;atisfied your Curio&s;ity much better in this matter, had you thought of it when I was among&s;t my Papers in <HI>Oxford,</HI> yet rather than hazard your good Opinion, or give the lea&s;t pretence of di&s;re&s;pect to your worthy <HI>Company,</HI> for who&s;e Per&s;ons and De&s;igns I have &s;o ju&s;t an e&s;teem and veneration: I here &s;end not what's fit for me to write, or you to read, but what I can remember upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Nor do I intend to &s;peak concerning the na|ture or compo&s;ition of Stones in general, or of <HI>Porphyry</HI> more particularly, but meerly as to matter of Fact, &s;o far chiefly as it fell under my own cognizance, <HI>i. e.</HI> if you plea&s;e, rather like an Hi&s;torian than a Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, I think it may be taken for granted, that there is no &s;uch <HI>Quarry,</HI> or Rock of Stone rather, in all the lower parts of <HI>Egypt</HI>; for &s;o far as the <HI>Nile</HI> o'erflows is perfect Soil. A Sample whereof I hope you &s;till retain, and let me entreat you to be very exact in weighing it this year, that you may be &s;ure
<PB N="150" REF="283">
whether it be heavier in the time of the inunda|tion (as is generally believed) than before or after: And when, and in what proportion it en|crea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Boundaries of this overflow (which are never ten miles from the <HI>Channel,</HI> that I &s;aw, generally &s;carce half of it, and in &s;ome places but a mile or two, (the <HI>Delta</HI> &s;till excepted, which is univer&s;ally covered, all but the North &s;ide to the Sea, and a little to the Ea&s;t for &s;ome miles above <HI>Damiata</HI>) are ri&s;ing Hills of Sand, beyond which is perfect De&s;art, upon the <HI>Africk</HI> &s;ide, the <HI>Lybian.</HI> [Higher South I have been told, there are Rocks nearer the River, and in &s;ome places &s;treighten it] but under tho&s;e Sands is a yielding Stone, not much harder than Chalk, though not &s;o white, and very ea&s;ily managed, as at the <HI>Mummies,</HI> deep &s;pacious Vaults, which were the old Repo&s;itories for the Dead. And the like al&s;o may be &s;aid of tho&s;e Cells or Sepul|chres which are hewn purely out of the Rocky Earth three quarters of a mile on the South of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Albeit nearer the Sea there are Stones of a harder kind, and with which they build; but by their mouldering away, as appears by the Remains of Hou&s;es within the Walls of the City, 'tis plain they can't endure the Wea|ther, which is &s;ufficiently corroding there. The Iron which once plated their thick wooden Gates being mo&s;tly eaten away, and the deep Characters upon the &s;ides of the&s;e very <HI>Porphyry Pillars</HI> exceedingly defaced. Indeed about <HI>Mem|phis, i. e.</HI> by the Pyramids, they have a milder Air, and the <HI>Hieroglyphicks</HI> cut in tho&s;e Stones will la&s;t well enough, till they &s;hall be removed into a rougher: But then they'l crizle and &s;cale, as I found by &s;ad experience. For having pro|cur'd
<PB N="151" REF="283">
four Stones, the be&s;t mark'd with tho&s;e fi|gures of Antiquity I could meet with, and &s;ent them down to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in order to their tran&s;portation for <HI>England,</HI> I found them, upon my &s;econd Voyage into <HI>Egypt,</HI> very much injur'd, being put into the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-yard (where they lye &s;till embargo'd) by the <HI>Aga,</HI> who de|manded an intolerable Sum for liberty to &s;hip them, as you may remember I told you the Story.</P>
<P>But yet farther in the Country there are Mountains of harder Stone: In the <HI>Nitrian,</HI> now the De&s;art of St. <HI>Macarius,</HI> and not far from the Lake where the <HI>Latroon</HI> or true <HI>Nitre</HI> incru|&s;tates upon the top of the Water, there are many, and &s;ome of them not utterly unlike <HI>Porphyry.</HI> That which neare&s;t re&s;embles its colour, though not its Con&s;i&s;tence, is the vein that produces the Eagle-&s;tone, of which there are many in the <HI>Bahr Batama,</HI> a great Sandy Valley: But the&s;e Stones are of a different complexion from <HI>Por|phyry,</HI> as you may perceive by tho&s;e I &s;ent you, which al&s;o will a&s;&s;i&s;t your conjectures of their original.</P>
<P>However, I can't pronounce that there is no Porphyry hereabouts; for in the chief Mona|&s;tery of the four now remaining (of 366, as many as are days in the longe&s;t year) dedicated to the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin</HI>; the two Stones which &s;e|cure their entrance are of the like, if not the very &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance; which I more particularly ob&s;erv'd upon the account of their ingenious contrivance; for the&s;e poor People, lying other|wi&s;e at the mercy of the roving <HI>Arabs,</HI> with the&s;e two Mill-&s;tones (for that's their make) thus make good their Gate again&s;t them, (or ra|ther their pa&s;&s;age) into which they run them,
<PB N="152" REF="284">
and then drive a great wooden Wedge between them on the in&s;ide, which &s;o fa&s;tens them, that they cannot be loo&s;ed, but upon the in&s;ide nei|ther. And of &s;uch a &s;ort of Porphyry is the no|ted <HI>Sphynx</HI> (a mighty head and &s;houlders 110 feet in compa&s;s) yet &s;tanding by the Northern Pyramids.</P>
<P>I have indeed been told of the place upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> whence this Porphyry came, but &s;o they &s;hew the very Rock where the two excel|lent double rows of Pillars in the Church of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> were hewn; though I went away &s;a|tisfied that 'twas a quite different &s;ort of Stone. Another tells of a Pillar of the &s;ame make yet lying there; and if this be certain, you need &s;eek no further. Albeit, I mu&s;t tell you, that the Stones brought thence with the repre&s;entati|on of a Buck (it mu&s;t needs be called) upon them, &s;ome of which you had, though reddi&s;h, are of a much finer, and more even tex|ture.</P>
<P><HI>Wan&s;leben</HI> writes of a great many, more Sou|therly; but I know him too well to believe all that he &s;ays for Go&s;pel. And a more &s;ober man, Father <HI>Carlo Franci&s;co d' Orleans,</HI> now Superior of the <HI>Capucines</HI> at <HI>Cairo,</HI> who went 300 leagues up the <HI>Nile</HI> in the year 69, told me of many Tem|ples, Statues, and Pillars at that di&s;tance; tho I can't be &s;ure he &s;aid there were any of Por|phyry. But &s;ince 'twas in <HI>Thebais,</HI> why may we not &s;uppo&s;e them of that black, white, and red &s;peckled <HI>Thebaick</HI> Marble, famous in the World, and wherewith the le&s;&s;er Pyramid perhaps was cru&s;ted, yet to be &s;een upon the ground about it, and when poli&s;h'd looks finely.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="284">Tho&s;e which I have my &s;elf &s;een, are one of them at the <HI>Matarea,</HI> three or four miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> and two at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> ju&s;t with|in the Wall upon the North &s;ide of the City; (for <HI>Pompey</HI>'s Pillar, as they call it) half a mile without the Gate to the South, is quite of another make and matter: One of the&s;e is thrown down and broken into pieces, but was of the &s;ame di|men&s;ions for breadth and thickne&s;s with the other. The <HI>Franks</HI> call them <HI>Aguglia</HI>'s, the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> particularly <HI>Cleopatra</HI>'s Needles, but the In|habitants content them&s;elves with the general name of Pillars. They have no <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> or Pede|&s;tals above ground; and if they never had, they mu&s;t needs be very deep in the Earth. The Draughts I here &s;end you will excu&s;e all farther De&s;cription. One of them was very well taken by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Brute</HI> a <HI>French Druggerman,</HI> the other by a Dutch Painter, who, you'l &s;ee, has but lit|tle commended his Art.</P>
<P>If you have a fancy, upon the &s;ight of'em, to &s;ift out the <HI>Hieroglyphick</HI> character with which they are engraven, perhaps you'l find it to be the aboriginal <HI>Egyptian</HI> Letter, long &s;ince worn out of common u&s;e in the Country, as the <HI>Samaritan</HI> (&s;o 'tis now generally call'd) was among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI>; and that it bears proportion with the <HI>China</HI> (now in u&s;e) where each note repre&s;ents a word, or rather an entire &s;ignification. And moreover, that 'tis wrought the &s;ame way too, from the <HI>top</HI> to the <HI>bottom</HI>; as you have &s;een in the Board I brought from a Door in the Village <HI>Succara</HI> (which is next to the <HI>Mummies</HI>) the lar|ge&s;t piece of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Writing, perhaps, at <HI>this</HI> day in <HI>Europe.</HI> I confe&s;s that in the Vaults or Prie&s;ts Chambers cut out of the Rock, clo&s;e by the &s;econd Pyramid, the whole Walls are in&s;cri|bed

therewith, but I &s;peak of an Original. And if all that is there written were but exactly co|pied, it might be then lawful to hope, that the Language &s;o long &s;ince dead and buried in the Hou&s;e of Bondage, might have its re&s;urrection in the Land of Liberty.</P>
<P>That &s;uch va&s;t Monuments might be remo|ved from place to place, is difficult indeed, but not impo&s;&s;ible. And if one <HI>Archimedes</HI> (as <HI>Athe|naeus</HI> pre&s;erves the Story for us) could lanch the va&s;t Ship of <HI>Hiero,</HI> which all the Strength of <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> was not able to bring to Sea; what might not many great Ma&s;ters in the &s;ame Art perform, and upon their own Dunghil too? for I may call <HI>Egypt</HI> the Mother of the Mathema|ticks.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;ome of the&s;e Mountains are near the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;s</HI> from <HI>Cairo</HI> but two or three days, from <HI>Nile</HI> le&s;s: And how po&s;&s;ible it is to convey mighty weights by Water, let the Obe|lisks at <HI>Rome</HI> declare; which were all of them brought from this very Country: And that &s;uch things may be done by Land too, though not by every one, is plain enough, becau&s;e we &s;ee they have been done.

<HEAD>A Journey from <HI>Grand Caire</HI> to Mecha.</HEAD>
<P>THE day that the <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> parted from <HI>Caire,</HI> he encamped in Tents, clo&s;e by the City, and a few days after he encamped at the <HI>Birque,</HI> which is a great Pond about twelve miles from <HI>Caire,</HI> near to which they encamp. This place is the Rende&s;vouz of all the Caravans. The <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> parted from thence with the whole Caravan, <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the eighth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> it be|ing the Cu&s;tom for the Caravan of <HI>Caire</HI> to &s;et out Seven and fifty days after the beginning of the <HI>Ramadam,</HI> that &s;o it may be there punctual|ly at the time. It is very pretty to &s;ee them en|camped in the Night-time, becau&s;e of the infinite number of Lamps that are in the Tents and Pa|vilions. Next day, the ninth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Ca|ravan of the <HI>Magrebins</HI> parted al&s;o from the <HI>Birque,</HI> and there all of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who intend to make the Journey, meet, and make a di&s;tinct Ca|ravan; which depends not on the <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Caire,</HI> but have a Chief of their own. That Ca|ravan never &s;ets out, but a day after the Caravan of <HI>Caire</HI>; they travel commonly by night, and re&s;t in the day time, as all other Caravans do that go to other places, that &s;o they may avoid the heat, which is almo&s;t in&s;upportable; and

when the Moon does not &s;hine, there are men who carry Links before the Caravan. In all Caravans, the Camels are tied tail to tail, &s;o that let them but go, and there is no trouble of lea|ding them.</P>
<P>Here I'll give the Reader an account, how many Stages there are betwixt <HI>Caire</HI> and <HI>Mecha,</HI> how many days they &s;tay in them, how many hours travelling there is betwixt them, and at what Stages the Waters are &s;weet or bitter, all along the way.

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Aga</HI> &s;ent to meet the Caravan upon their Return.</HEAD>
<P>ABout &s;ix weeks after the &s;etting out of the Caravan of <HI>Caire,</HI> when they know that it is ready to return from <HI>Mecha,</HI> an <HI>Aga</HI> goes from <HI>Caire</HI> to guard the fre&s;h Provi&s;ions that the People of the Country &s;end to their Friends and Relations in the Caravan, every one &s;ending ac|cording to their abilities and Friend&s;hip, all which are well &s;ealed up, and delivered to tho&s;e they belong unto. For this effect the <HI>Aga</HI> has many Camels with him, and <HI>gets</HI> con&s;idera|bly

by the Caravan, which he meets half way. This year it returned on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>November,</HI> and encamped at the <HI>Birque,</HI> where the Caravan of the <HI>Magrebins</HI> arrived the day before. Several come to <HI>Caire</HI> the &s;ame day, and their Friends go as far as the <HI>Birque</HI> to welcome them; whereupon meeting, they ki&s;s again and again five or &s;ix times, and all who know them &s;alute and ki&s;s them in the &s;ame manner; and indeed, for &s;ome days after there is nothing to be &s;een in the City, but people ki&s;&s;ing one another, or lamenting their Rela|tions who died in the Journey, Men, Women, and Children, who howl and make fearful ge|&s;tures, when they hear the news from the fir&s;t of the Caravan, whom they meet. The&s;e Pil|grims are forty five days in going, and as much in coming back to <HI>Caire,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome days they &s;tay there; but they make but ea&s;ie Journeys, it being impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o great a body &s;hould march fa&s;t, for they mu&s;t often &s;top to load the Camels who&s;e loads have fallen off, to unload tho&s;e that fall or die, or to bury their Dead, and a thou&s;and &s;uch other accidents; and when one Camel &s;tops, all the re&s;t mu&s;t wait. They travel commonly (as I &s;aid) in the night-time with Links, that they may avoid the heat. In this Journey they find but little Water, and that exceeding bad too: As for fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, they find none, and eat only what they carry along with them: But the wor&s;t thing they meet with in the Journey, are certain hot Winds, which &s;tifle the Breath, and in a &s;hort time kill a great many people. The Prince of <HI>Tunis</HI> told me, that in one day &s;everal hundreds died of that Wind, and that he him&s;elf was much afraid that he &s;hould have been one of the number. In fine,
<PB N="161" REF="288">
in this Expedition there died &s;ix thou&s;and, what of Fatigue, Thir&s;t, and the&s;e hot Winds. In that Journey People are to be &s;een riding on Camels, and &s;inging Ver&s;es of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> who &s;uddenly fall down dead. Tho&s;e who return with life are &s;o alter'd and extenuated, that they can hardly be known; and neverthele&s;s va&s;t numbers of People from all parts yearly perform that Pilgrimage, and there pa&s;&s;es not a year wherein Women and little Children do not make it. They who have performed that Jour|ney are called <HI>Adgi,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Pilgrims, meaning though only the Pilgrimage of the <HI>Kiaabe,</HI> and they are much re&s;pected by all as long as they live, and highly credited. The <HI>Emir-Adge</HI> gains much by this Journey, for the Goods of all that dye belong to him, be&s;ides a va&s;t deal of other profits that he makes on &s;everal occa&s;ions; and it is thought, that every Expedi|tion he gets above an hundred thou&s;and Pia&s;tres, but this year he got above three hundred thou|&s;and, for many People died. The greate&s;t Pre|rogative of this Office is, that during the whole Expedition he is ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of the Field, and admini&s;ters Ju&s;tice as he thinks fit.</P>
<P>Having in my hands an exact De&s;cription of <HI>Mecha,</HI> and con&s;idering that few or no Travellers have &s;poken of it with any certainty, I thought it would not be ami&s;s to add it, and make a par|ticular Chapter thereof.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> Mecha <HI>and</HI> Medina.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MEcha</HI> is &s;even and thirty days Journey from <HI>Caire,</HI> and all over De&s;arts; it is a days Journey from the Red-Sea; the Port of it is cal|led <HI>Gidde,</HI> which is a little Town, wherein are two Ca&s;tles on the two &s;ides of the Port, one on each &s;ide, and the Turks &s;ay that <HI>Eve</HI> lies buried there: They &s;hew her Sepulchre, which is in length 38 or 40 &s;teps of a man's walk, and hath no other Ornament but a Stone at each end.</P>
<P><HI>Mecha</HI> is about the bigne&s;s of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> in the middle whereof is the <HI>Kiaabe</HI> or <HI>Beytullah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Hou&s;e of God, which (the Turks &s;ay) was fir&s;t built by the Patriarch <HI>Abraham.</HI> This Hou&s;e is about fifteen foot in length, eleven or twelve in breadth, and about five fathom high. The Thre&s;hold of the Door is as high from the ground as a man can reach his Hand, being within filled up even with the Thre&s;hold. The Door is about a fathom and an half high, and a fathom wide, and is in the corner to the left hand, when one faces the Hou&s;e. This Door is of beaten Silver, and opens with two leaves; they go up to it by a Ladder &s;upported by four Wheels, two whereof are fa&s;tened to the lower end of the Ladder, and the other two to two wooden Po&s;ts about the middle of it, by means of which Wheels the Ladder is run to the Wall, when any body is to enter into the <HI>Beytullah.</HI></P>
<P>This Hou&s;e has a flat Roof, &s;upported by three Pillars of an Octogone Figure, which are of <HI>Aloes</HI>-wood, as big as the Body of a man, and

about three fathom and a half long; they are of one entire piece each, and yet run in a &s;treight Line the length of the Building, which is hung with red and white Stuff, having here and there the&s;e words upon them, <HI>La Illah Illal|lah, Mouhammed Re&s;oul allah.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame corner where the Door is (but on the other &s;ide by the Wall) is the black Stone, which they call <HI>Hadgiar A&s;uad,</HI> and is had in veneration by them, becau&s;e (as they &s;ay) <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;tood upon it when he built that Hou&s;e, and that it &s;erved him for a Scaffold, to the end he might make no hole in the Wall, it ri&s;ing higher or lower as he plea&s;ed, and being for that purpo&s;e brought him by the Angel <HI>Gabriel.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Court about this Hou&s;e, which the Turks call <HI>Haram,</HI> and it is encompa&s;&s;ed with Walls, with three rows of Pillars, and Arches on the in&s;ide of it.

<P>This Hou&s;e is begirt with two Belts of Gold, one below, and the other on high. On one &s;ide of the Terra&s;s that covers the <HI>Beitullah</HI> there is a Spout of beaten Gold, about a fathom long, that jets out, to carry off the Rain-water that falls up|on the Terra&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Hou&s;e is covered on the out-&s;ide with Hangings of black Silk, which is a kind of Damask, and every year there are new ones &s;ent from <HI>Caire,</HI> at the charges of the <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></P>

<P>There are four Kings that pay Tribute to the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> to wit, the King of <HI>Sennar,</HI> who pays his Tribute in Hor&s;es. <HI>Sennar</HI> is a very hot Country. The King of <HI>Naria,</HI> who pay his Tribute in Gold. The King of <HI>Bugia,</HI> and King of <HI>Dangala. Naria</HI> is a good Country, and in that Country are the Mines out of which they have the Gold that pa&s;&s;es on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Soffala</HI> and <HI>Guiney.</HI> The&s;e Mines are not deep, as in many other Countries. From that Country al|&s;o comes the Civet. I think it will not be ami&s;s here to &s;ay &s;omewhat of Civets, which are &s;o rare in our Country, as that they de&s;erve to be taken notice of where one can find them. They are called <HI>Civet-Cats,</HI> come from <HI>Naria,</HI> (as I ju&s;t now &s;aid) and are taken in Snares. The Jews in <HI>Caire</HI> keep many of them in their Hou|&s;es, where for buying a few drachms of Civet one may &s;ee them. It is a Bea&s;t almo&s;t as big as a good Dog: It hath a &s;harp Snout, &s;mall Eyes, little Ears, and Mu&s;tachios like a Cat: The Skin of it is all &s;potted black and white, with &s;ome yellowi&s;h &s;pecks, and hath a long bu&s;hy Tail, almo&s;t like a Fox. It is a very wild Creature, and I believe the bite of it would put
<PB N="178" REF="297">
a body to no &s;mall pain. The Jews keep them in great &s;quare Wooden Cages, where they feed them with raw Mutton and Beef, cut into &s;mall pieces. When they would get from them that which is called Civet, (and is the Sweat of this Bea&s;t, that &s;mells &s;o &s;weet) they make him go back with a &s;tick which they thru&s;t in betwixt the Bars of the Cage and catch hold of his Tail: When they have that fa&s;t, they take hold al&s;o of his two hind Legs, pulling him half out of the Cage by the Door, which falls down up|on his Back, and keeps him fa&s;t there, then ano|ther opens a certain Cod of Fle&s;h that the&s;e Bea&s;ts have, which is &s;haped like a &s;plit Gy&s;erne, and with an Iron Spatula &s;crapes all the Sweat off it within. The Males have that piece of Fle&s;h betwixt their Stones and Yard, which is like a Cats. The Females have it betwixt their Fundament and Privities, and it is emptied of the Sweat but twice a week, each Bea&s;t yield|ing about a <HI>drachm at a time,</HI> by what I could di&s;cern. When that Sweat or Excrement is ta|ken out, it is of a whiti&s;h grey, but by little and little, in &s;ome &s;hort &s;pace, it turns to a very brown colour. It &s;mells very &s;weet at a di|&s;tance, but near hand it &s;tinks and cau&s;es a Head|ach. There are as many kinds of Civet-Sweat, as there are of Civet-Cats, for it is more whiti&s;h, greyi&s;h, or yellowi&s;h, and dryer in &s;ome than in others, and yet they mingle all together. After all, it is in vain to think to have pure Civet, for the Jews fal&s;ifie it; and if a man imagine it to be pure, becau&s;e he has &s;een it taken from the Bea&s;t, he is mi&s;taken, for before People come to their Hou&s;es, they rub the in&s;ide of that piece of Fle&s;h, with a little Oyl, or &s;ome &s;uch Stuff, that &s;o the Sweat and it together may make
<PB N="179" REF="297">
more weight, but when no body is pre&s;ent, they take it out pure, and mingle it afterwards. To find out the truth of this, I went one day to the Hou&s;e of a Jew, that kept Civet-Cats, without giving him notice before, (for becau&s;e I had bought a little of him, and promi&s;ed to come again another time, he asked me as often as he &s;aw me, what day I would come) and ha|ving de&s;ired him to get me &s;ome fre&s;h Civet, he told me, that it was not the day he u&s;ed to take it out; and having returned without acquain|ting him before, upon one of the days when he &s;aid he was accu&s;tomed to gather it, he refu&s;ed then al&s;o to do it, pretending Bu&s;ine&s;s, which confirmed all that had been told me of that mat|ter. In the mean time they hold the&s;e Bea&s;ts very dear; for having asked that <HI>Jew,</HI> and others al&s;o, how much they would have of me, for a Civet Cat, they all told me, an hundred Chequins. <HI>Dangala</HI> is the capital City of <HI>Nubia,</HI> the King of <HI>Dangala</HI> is King of the <HI>Barberins,</HI> who are a kind of Blacks, of the Mu&s;ulman Religion, that came in Crowds to <HI>Caire,</HI> to get Services; they are &s;omewhat &s;illy, but very faithful, and &s;erve for a &s;mall matter, for two Maidins a day, or a Maidin and their Dyet: You may make them do what&s;oever you plea&s;e. They wear a blew Shirt, plat all their Hair in Tre&s;&s;es, and then rub it over with a certain Oyl, to keep their Head from being lou&s;ie. At <HI>Caire,</HI> when they have any falling out, they go before the <HI>Scheiks</HI> of their own Nation, who make them Friends, and if they think it convenient, adjudg them to pay a Fine, with which they fea&s;t and make merry together. They are great lovers of Crocodiles Fle&s;h; and when any <HI>Frank</HI> has got one for the Skin, they come and beg the Fle&s;h,
<PB N="180" REF="298">
which they dre&s;s with a pretty good Sawce. When the&s;e Blades have &s;craped together ten or twelve Pia&s;tres, they return home again wealthy to their own Country, provided they e&s;cape be|ing robbed by the <HI>Arabs</HI> upon the way, who many times &s;erve them &s;o, therefore they com|monly return in companies, as they came. The King of <HI>Dangala</HI> pays his Tribute to the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in Cloth. The Provinces of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> are <HI>Gouyan,</HI> (where the King keeps a Viceroy) <HI>Beghandir, Dambia, Amara,</HI> (which is a great Pro|vince, full of Mountains and good Ca&s;tles) <HI>Da|moud Tegre,</HI> and <HI>Barnegas.</HI> Be&s;ides, there are &s;e|veral Provinces governed by Princes, who are Va&s;&s;als to the King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> In &s;hort, the Kingdom of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> comprehends twenty four <HI>Tambours</HI> or Vice Roys.

He keeps all his Children on a Mountain, cal|led <HI>Ouhhni,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Oinadaga,</HI> which is a Mountain two days Journey di&s;tant from <HI>Gonthar</HI>; there is a place like a Ci&s;tern on the top of the Mountain, into which they are let down every night, and taken up again in the day-time, and &s;uffered to play and walk about. When the King dyes, they chu&s;e out one of the wittie&s;t of them, and make him King, without
<PB N="181" REF="298">
any regard to Birth-right; and when he comes to have Children, he &s;ends his Brothers Pri&s;o|ners to &s;ome other place, and places his Children at <HI>Ouhhni.</HI> The place where the Kings are bu|ried, is called <HI>Aye&s;us,</HI> and is a kind of Grott, where the Aged are laid in one &s;ide, and the young in the other. Heretofore there was a Church there of the &s;ame name, in time of the Je&s;uites; and in the &s;ame place there is a Libra|ry. The Amba&s;&s;ador a&s;&s;ured me, that he had been in that Library, and I fancy it is the old Library of the Ancient <HI>Ethiopians. Ethiopia</HI> is a good and fertile Country, producing Wheat, Barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The greate&s;t De&s;arts of it are not above three or four days Journey over; and ne|verthele&s;s, when the King makes any progre&s;s, he lodges in Tents. The Hou&s;es of the great Lords are like tho&s;e of <HI>Caire,</HI> that is to &s;ay, very mean, in re&s;pect of the Hou&s;es of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the re&s;t are only of Mud. The Country affords men of all Trades, except Watch-makers. They have no Camels there, but Mules, A&s;&s;es, Oxen, and Hor&s;es. All the People of this Country eat raw Fle&s;h, except the King, who has it dre&s;s'd, and drinks Wine of Grapes; the re&s;t drink only Wine made of Millet or Sara&s;in Wheat, but as &s;trong as ours, and Brandy made of the &s;ame Grain. They are cloathed after the fa&s;hion of the <HI>Franks,</HI> and wear Cloath, Velvet, and other Stuffs imported to them by the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI> They have Harquebu&s;&s;es from the Turks, and of tho&s;e People there are not above three or four hun|dred who &s;erve in the Wars with Harquebu&s;&s;es. In Trading they make no u&s;e of coyned Money, as the <HI>Europeans</HI> do, but their Money are pieces of fifteen or twenty <HI>Pies</HI> of Cloth, Gold, which they give by weight, and a kind of Salt, which
<PB N="182" REF="299">
they reduce into little &s;quare pieces like pieces of Soap, and the&s;e pa&s;s for Money. They cut out that Salt upon the &s;ide of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> five or &s;ix days Journey from <HI>Dangala,</HI> as you go from <HI>Caire,</HI> and the places where they make it are cal|led <HI>Arho.</HI> Among them is the Nation of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> whom in <HI>Ethiopick</HI> they call <HI>Chava,</HI> and are a Vagabond people in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as the <HI>Arabs</HI> are in <HI>Egygt.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Gauls</HI> are rich in Cattel, and are alwaies at wars with the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> They have no Harquebu&s;&s;es, nor other Fire-Arms, but make u&s;e of Lances and Targets. After all, they &s;peak &s;o m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny different Languages in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;aid to me, <HI>If God hath made &s;eventy two Languages, they are all &s;poken in</HI> Ethio|pia. I asked his Excellency if he knew any thing of the Source of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and this he told me concerning it: The Head of <HI>Nile</HI> is a Well that &s;prings out of the Ground in a large Plain, where many Trees grow: this Fountain is called <HI>Ouem|bromma,</HI> and is in a Province called <HI>Ago.</HI> It makes that a very delightful place, ca&s;ting up Water very high in &s;everal places: And this Am|ba&s;&s;adour of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that he had been above twelve times with the King of <HI>Ethio|pia,</HI> to &s;pend &s;everal days about that Fountain, which is twelve days Journey from <HI>Gonthar.</HI></P>

<HEAD>More Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> by Fa|ther Lobo, <HI>Father</HI> Alvarez, <HI>Father Tellez,</HI> and others; extracted from their <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Voyages.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rains begin to fall in <HI>June,</HI> and conti|nue <HI>July, Augu&s;t,</HI> and part of <HI>September,</HI> which make the <HI>Nile</HI> &s;well and overflow in tho&s;e Months. Father <HI>Tellez</HI> &s;ays, the Mountains of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> are much higher than our <HI>Alps</HI> and <HI>Py|renean</HI> Hills; the&s;e render the Country more temperate and healthful, and make that torrid Climate tolerable to the <HI>European</HI> Bodies: There is plenty of good Springs and Herbage. In the mid&s;t of the Plains there ri&s;e up many &s;teep Rocks of wonderful Figures and Shapes, on the tops whereof are Woods, Meadows, Fountains, Fi&s;h-ponds, and other conveniencies of Life: The Natives get up to them by Ropes, and crane up their Cattel: The&s;e are like &s;o many For|tre&s;&s;es, which defend the Natives again&s;t the &s;udden Incur&s;ions of barbarous Nations on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>This Kingdom abounds with Metals, but they neglect to work them, le&s;t Turki&s;h or other In|va&s;ions &s;hould follow, if &s;uch Baits were di&s;co|ver'd. Their Winter is from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> the Sun then pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing perpendicu|lar over their Heads. During this Sea&s;on, once every day it rains Torrents, and thunders mo&s;t

violently, which are accompanied &s;ometimes with &s;udden and furious Hurricanes.</P>

<P>The Animals of this va&s;t Kingdom are, the <HI>Hippopotamus,</HI> or River-hor&s;e, which makes great deva&s;tation in their Plantations, <HI>Crocodiles, Rhi|nocerots, Elephants, Lyons, Tygers, Panthers, Camelo|pardalus, Gazels, Zembra's, Civet-Cats</HI>; great va|rieties of <HI>Monkeys, Apes,</HI> and <HI>Baboons; O&s;triches, Ca&s;&s;owars, Turtles, Locu&s;ts</HI> in prodigious numbers. The ordinary Trees are, the <HI>Date, Coco, Tama|rind, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ia, Oranges, Mu&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Plantane, Cotton-Trees,</HI> with many others peculiar to the Climate and Region.</P>
<P>In one year they will have three &s;everal crops of Rice, Millet, Tef-Seed, (their common Food ten times le&s;s than Mu&s;tard-Seed) of Wheat, and other <HI>European</HI> Grain, yet the Locu&s;ts often de|vour all, and bring on Famines.</P>
<P>They make a Drink of Honey, burnt Rice, Water, and a Wood call'd <HI>Sardo.</HI> They have no Mills, but grind all their Grain with the Hand.</P>

<P>The <HI>Habe&s;&s;ine</HI> Ports towards the Red-Sea are very ill guarded, therefore the Turks are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Arkiko</HI> and <HI>Matzua.</HI> The <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> are not addicted to Navigation, they Trade only with the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and carry their Goods to <HI>Suaquena, Arkiko,</HI> and <HI>Matzua:</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> often get entrance into the Country, where they are very well received.</P>

<P>Father <HI>Hieronymo Lobo</HI> ob&s;erv'd the Red Sea to be navigable only in the middle, in which are &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands and Rocks above Water, of little danger in clear weather: The two Shoars of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Ethiopia</HI> are of very bad pa&s;&s;age, full of Shoals, Rocks, and Corals. The entrance of this Sea is the cleare&s;t and deepe&s;t on the &s;ide of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and is the ordinary pa&s;&s;age for Ships of burthen, the other part of the mouth towards <HI>Ethiopia</HI> is full of Flats and Shoals, &s;o that none ventures through but little Ve&s;&s;els: The Pearl-fi&s;hing is near the I&s;land of <HI>Daleca.</HI> On &s;everal parts of this Sea we ob&s;erv'd abundance of red|di&s;h
