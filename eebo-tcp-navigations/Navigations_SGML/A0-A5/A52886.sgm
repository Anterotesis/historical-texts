<HEAD>A Short Account OF THE Pre&s;ent STATE OF <HI>New-England.</HI> Anno Domini <HI>1690.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT large tract of Land, which lies between the Degrees of <HI>Forty</HI> and <HI>Forty-five,</HI> is known by the general Name of <HI>New-England,</HI> but divided into many Provinces and Colonies; mu&s;t of which had, in times pa&s;t, di&s;tinct Governments, and made &s;uch Laws as &s;eem'd be&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable to their particular Frames and Con&s;titutions; which interfering with the Intere&s;ts of their Neighbours; and indeed, being framed for &s;ome private Intere&s;t, more than for the Publick Good, they lived not in that Peace and Quiet, which was nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation and good E&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e Young Settlements, but had con|tinual petts &amp; differences among them&s;elves, till in the Year 1686 they were all united and ca&s;t into one Government, which was committed to the care of Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The Names of the &s;everal Colonies and Provinces, are the&s;e that follow, <HI>Road, I&s;land, Plymouth, Narragan&s;et</HI> Country, <HI>Connecticot, New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> Province of <HI>Maine,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's</HI>-Colony.</P>
<P><HI>Road-I&s;land</HI> is of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s, and ju&s;tly called the <HI>Garden of New-England,</HI> for its Fertility and Plea&s;antne&s;s. It abounds with all things nece&s;&s;ary for the life of Man, is excel|lent
<PB N="2" REF="2">for Sheep, Kine and Hor&s;es; and being environed by the Sea, it is free'd from the dangers of Bears, Wolves and Foxes, which much mole&s;t and damni&s;&s;e tho&s;e that live on the Con|tinent.</P>
<P>The People for &s;ome tract of time had a Charter to them|&s;elves, lived under a Governour of their own choo&s;ing, and Laws of their own making: But in Year 1686, upon &s;erving the <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> they freely re&s;igned up their Charter to His Maje&s;ty, and continue &s;o well &s;atis&s;ied with the &s;urrender, that they do not &s;o much as petition for their Charter again.</P>
<P>Here is a medley of mo&s;t Per&s;wa&s;ions, but neither Church nor Meeting-hou&s;e, except one built for the u&s;e of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who are here very numerous, and have annually a General Meeting from all Quarters.</P>
<P>Many of the others regard neither Time, nor Place, nor Wor&s;hip; and even &s;ome very &s;ober men have lived &s;o long without it, that they think all in&s;tituted Religion u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The People live in great plenty, &s;end Hor&s;es and Provi&s;i|ons to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and the <HI>Leeward-I&s;lands,</HI> and &s;ell great num|bers of fat Oxen and Sheep to the Butchers of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ettlement of this Colony, was in this manner; The People of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who always had a perfect hatred again&s;t all tho&s;e who differed in Opinion from them, had &s;ome <HI>Quakers</HI> in the Land; and how to rid them&s;elves fairly of the&s;e, they had many Con&s;ultations, which at la&s;t ended in this re&s;ult; They would bani&s;h them to &s;ome place or other, from whence they might be &s;ure to be never troubled with them again; So they bani&s;h'd the <HI>Quakers</HI> to this I&s;land, where in all pro|bability they mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd with hunger, or el&s;e been de&s;troyed by the Heathens: hither the&s;e poor people being come, dig them&s;elves Caves in the earth, and by the kindne&s;s of the <HI>Indians,</HI> outlive the &s;everity of a long and &s;harp Win|ter. The Spring coming on, they obtain'd leave from the <HI>Sachem</HI> to manure the ground, and in a little time wrought them&s;elves into good E&s;tates, which &s;ome even of the fir&s;t &s;etlers enjoy to this day. Being thus happily &s;ettled, they Petitioned King <HI>Charles</HI> II. that they might have a Charter to them&s;elves, fearing lea&s;t they &s;hould fell under the la&s;h of the <HI>Bo&s;toners</HI> again, who had been &s;o Inhumane and Barbarous to them in their bani&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Plymouth</HI> compared with the former is but a mean and
<PB N="3" REF="2">poor Country, yet the ground well compen&s;ates the Husband|man's labour with good crops of Corn; and being wa&s;h'd by the Sea, they make great benefit by Fi&s;hery; as al&s;o their Bay, of late years, is much inrich'd by great numbers of Whales which come into it; and even the Rocky Mountains yield them con&s;iderable pro&s;it, for on them grow plenty of Pine|trees, out of which they make abundance of Tar for their Ships.</P>
<P>The Religion of the Country is exactly after the model of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> from whom they receive Di|rections and Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>This People being without Law, and without Government from <HI>England,</HI> cho&s;e Governours and made Laws for them&s;elves; of all which <HI>Hinckleys</HI> is the mo&s;t Famous, whereby they &s;tript the poor <HI>Quakers</HI> of all that many of them had, for not coming to their Meetings.</P>
<P>In this E&s;tate they continued without any Charter, till King <HI>James</HI> ordered them to be under the Governmene of Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s.</HI> The late Addre&s;s they made to Their Maje&s;ties, acknowledges as much, in which they petition for Their Maje&s;ties Grant to be a di&s;tinct Government.</P>
<P>The <HI>Narragan&s;ett</HI> Countrey is a large tract of Ground, lit|tle inhabited, but the greate&s;t part of the Country is taken up by &s;everal Per&s;ons. Some of the <HI>Bo&s;toners</HI> claim a propriety for &s;everal miles together, but never take care to make the lea&s;t Improvement. Churches here are none, and but a few Hou&s;es: I cannot &s;ay there is one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Town in the whole Province.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the <HI>Narragan&s;ett</HI> Country, is the &s;ettlement of the <HI>French Prote&s;tants;</HI> who, on the vio|lence of the Per&s;ecution, left their Country, came over to <HI>New-England,</HI> and took up their habitation in this Wilderne&s;s; where they have made good improvement, live comfortably, and have planted great numbers of Vines, which they &s;ay thrive well, and it is hoped will be very beneficial to them.</P>
<P>This Wilderne&s;s leads to a very fertile and plea&s;ant Coun|try called <HI>Connecticott,</HI> which may be truly &s;tyled the glory of the <HI>Maine,</HI> for richne&s;s of Soil, and product of the Ground; there being great plenty of Wheat, Barley and Grain, with a|bundance of Sheep, Kine and Hor&s;es. It may well be called, as many will have it, the <HI>Aegypt</HI> of <HI>America</HI> from its wonderful
<PB N="4" REF="3">fertility, and that from the overflowing of the great Riven <HI>Connecticott,</HI> which, like <HI>Nilus,</HI> annually overfloweth the banks, and thereby inricheth the Soil.</P>
<P>This Country hath many inhabitants who live in great plenty, and communicate largely towards the &s;upport of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> whether they &s;end annually great quantity of Wheat and other grain, with many Head of fed Cattle.</P>
<P>As <HI>New-England,</HI> in General, is Healthy, &s;o this Countrey &s;hares in that great Ble&s;&s;ing. However, after great Glutts of Rain, the <HI>Feavey</HI> and <HI>Ague</HI> make &s;ome unwelcome Vi&s;its among them.</P>
<P>Here are many Towns and Villages, the greate&s;t of all is called <HI>Hartford,</HI> where they have their general Meetings, and keep Courts of Judicature, and tran&s;act publick Affairs. In this Town are two Meeting-Hou&s;es for publick Wor&s;hip, which &s;hews it is large and well Peopled.</P>
<P>In Religion, they generally follow the Model of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts Independents,</HI> by whom they are managed and governed in all things.</P>
<P>This People lived for &s;ome time under a Charter-Govern|met; but in the Year 1687, re&s;igning their Charter, they de|&s;ired to be put under Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s</HI>'s Government; and at his Arrival among them, they received him with great joy, and lived very quiet under him, till the grand ri&s;ing at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who&s;e Example they followed, and &s;et up their Char|ter again.</P>
<P><HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> is another Province, very healthy, and well &s;ettled, hath an excellent Harbour for Ships, where they may ride very &s;ecure in all weather. Their Soil is none of the be&s;t, nor the Countrey the mo&s;t plea&s;ant in the World; but yet, as it is, they rai&s;e abundance of Corn and Provi&s;ion; and the meanne&s;s of the Soil, is fully compen&s;ated another way. For in this, and in the neighbouring Province of <HI>Maine,</HI> grow tho&s;e &s;tately Trees, which make as good Ma&s;ts, as any in the World, and in &s;uch abundance, that &s;carce any part of the World can &s;hew the like. They &s;end many to <HI>En|gland,</HI> and have wherewith to &s;upply, not only Their Ma|je&s;ties Navy, but if well Husbanded, the whole Nation. It is pity there &s;hould be &s;uch havock made of tho&s;e &s;tately Trees, which without number they Yearly cut down and &s;aw into Boards.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>The People live friendly together, freer in Conver&s;ation than mo&s;t of their Countrey-men, and given to Ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>What Religion they have, comes from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> but at pre|&s;ent, their chief Town is de&s;titute of all publick Wor&s;hip; for their Teacher, with whom they entred into mutual Church-Covenant, has for&s;aken them, having got him&s;elf a richer Church in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>This people for many Years have lived under the imme|diate Government of the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> and being in the late ri&s;ing, &s;tirred up by &s;ome of their neighbours, to a&s;|&s;ume a Government to them&s;elves, an&s;wered, that they were well, and ea&s;y, and de&s;ired &s;o to continue.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Maine,</HI> is an excellent Tract of Land, but I am afraid at this time, without Inhabitants; the People be|ing either killed, or carried away captives, by the <HI>Indians,</HI> or el&s;e fled to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> for pre&s;ervation of their Lives.</P>
<P>As in <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &s;o here grow the Trees for Ma&s;ts, with all other &s;orts of Timber for Shipping; upon which Account, it is preferable to any part of <HI>New-England.</HI> The Soil is very rich, well requiting the Husbandmans labour and pains: So bountiful hath Nature been to the Land, and no le&s;s kind to the Sea-coa&s;t: For on the&s;e &s;hoars is the be&s;t Fi&s;h|ing ground in all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dominions, where are annually caught Ship-loads of <HI>Cod,</HI> and other great Fi&s;hes. For Har|bour, it may compare with mo&s;t Countries of the World; having tho&s;e that are &s;pacious and &s;ecure again&s;t all Storms, as if God Almighty had de&s;igned it for a great and mighty People. I lament the pre&s;ent de&s;olations of this Coun|trey; for it had Towns, Villages, and Forts, till very late|ly; but now the Towns are burnt, and the Forts demoli&s;hed, for which deva&s;tations, in great mea&s;ure, they are bound to thank their New <HI>Lords</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour, Sir <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s,</HI> had &s;o covered the Coun|trey again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that all the time the Go|vernment re&s;ted in his hands, the People were in the greate&s;t &s;afety, and not the lea&s;t mi&s;chief happened unto them.</P>
<P>But upon the Ri&s;ing of the People of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the <HI>Patriots</HI> there, re-called the Forces from thence, and left the whole Countrey a Prey to their &s;avage Enemies. So that <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, when the <HI>Bostoners</HI> took the Reins of Government into their hands, to the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> there were above an hundred of the
<PB N="6" REF="4">poor Countrey People killed, or carried away captives, Hou&s;es burnt, Forts razed, and all their Goods pillaged by the Enemy.</P>
<P>It remains to give a De&s;cription of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> which is the lea&s;t of all the <HI>Coloines,</HI> but would be accounted the greate&s;t; nay, they are very de&s;irous to appropriate the name of <HI>New-England</HI> to them&s;elves, and endeavour what they can to extend their Com|mon-wealth over the greate&s;t part of that Continent.</P>
<P>For they claim a right to a great part of the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI>-Coun|trey, alledging that the Lands belong to them, becau&s;e they bought it of the Natives.</P>
<P>In the like manner, they &s;ay, that the Province of <HI>Maine</HI> is theirs; for Mr. <HI>&V;&s;her</HI> bought the Government, as well as the Soil of the <HI>Proprietor,</HI> and they bought it of Mr. <HI>&V;&s;her.</HI> They may al&s;o lay a Title to <HI>Connecticott,</HI> and <HI>Plymouth;</HI> becau&s;e there, the generallty of the People are of the &s;ame per&s;wa&s;ion with them of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Colonies</HI> have all along been Governed and Ma|naged by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI> But yet by their Charter, they are bounded within <HI>Merimack</HI> River, and <HI>Charles</HI> River; which bounds it is to be hoped Their Maje&s;ties will not &s;uffer them to exceed.</P>
<P>The Countrey in &s;ome part is very &s;tony and mountainous, &s;o that for many miles together, little el&s;e is to be &s;een but Shrubs, a few &s;cattering Trees, and the gri&s;ly head of Rocks. In other places, it is very dry and &s;andy, little profitable to the Husband|man, without great plenty of Rain and Showers. The Soil is but poor of it &s;elf; and yet at fir&s;t &s;ettlement, the Countrey-mans la|bour was well rewarded with good crops of Wheat, excellent Pea&s;e, and other Grain; but for many Years, the Wheat hath been con|tinually bla&s;ted, and the Pea&s;e breed a Worm in them&s;elves, which eats out the heart, and leaves only the husk for the Planter.</P>
<P>For the generality of the people, they are very cen&s;orious, and ready, on all occa&s;ions, to judge one another; and &s;ome there are among them&s;elves that attribute this plague to the immediate hand of God for the cruelty of the people again&s;t the <HI>Quakers.</HI> The cau&s;e is &s;ecret, but it is a general ob&s;er|vation, that much about that time when the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;uffered, came the bla&s;ting on the Wheat, and the Worm into the Pea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Indian</HI> Corn is the &s;taff of the Land, and that on which they have the greate&s;t dependance; for if that fails, all is gone. The &s;ins committed in Husking of it are very great and no|torious,
<PB N="7" REF="4">it is much to be feared God will enter into judge|ment with them for it, and &s;mite the <HI>Indian</HI> Corn with a Cur&s;e.</P>
<P>The Commodities of the Colony are quickly reckoned up; for th&ocirc; in Print they boa&s;t of the Trade they can drive with their Fi&s;h and Lumber-Goods, yet they have in truth, but lit|tle Lumber, and le&s;s Fi&s;h, except what they receive from the Fi&s;hermen and Inhabitants of the Province of <HI>Maine</HI> and <HI>New Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and not one Tree in the Land that will make a Ma&s;t for a Ship. 'Tis true, the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> build many Ships, and other Ve&s;&s;els, but they bring mo&s;t of their Materials from other Countreys; as al&s;o they &s;end abroad many Ve&s;&s;els laden with Boards, Pipe, Staves, and Provi&s;ions, all which are but as borrowed Goods which they fetch out of the neighbouring Colonies.</P>
<P>This Colony hath many Towns and Villages, of which the greate&s;t is <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> large and well peopled, where are kept the Courts of Judicature, and the publick Records of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The people are naturally courteous, affable and obliging, but for the Government of them, who are all of the gather|ed Churches, <HI>their Separate way</HI> makes them very high and un|&s;ociable, looking on others as mean abject creatures, who de|&s;erve their <HI>Pity</HI> rather than their <HI>Company.</HI></P>
<P>In their Dealings they are very cra&s;ty and &s;ubtle, out-doing even Jews them&s;elves, who (as I heard a <HI>New-England-man</HI> boa&s;tingly &s;ay) could not live among&s;t them. They are watch|ful of all advantages over them they deal with, and when they have a Man within their Clutches, gripe him unmerci|fully. In their Treats they are very lavi&s;h and expen&s;ive; where they cohceive a prejudice they are revengeful, and very Religiou&s;ly pray for de&s;truction on their Enemies. Hence &s;ome that knew them very well, have given this caution to their Children, <HI>Above all Per&s;ons, take heed of a Profe&s;&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>This I &s;ay for the generality of them, not but that there are many worthy, charitable, and Religious people among them, (who as I am fully per&s;waded) &s;erve God with a perfect heart, and love their Neighbour with love unfeigned.</P>
<P>But as in all other places, &s;o among the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> Vice greatly abounds, and there is no &s;in in <HI>Old England,</HI> but what is practiced in the <HI>New.</HI> However &s;ome Sins &s;peed wor&s;e among them than others. Swearing, Cur&s;ing; and Bla&s;pheming
<PB N="8" REF="5">are ju&s;tly di&s;countenanc'd: but they who &s;cruple an Oath will make no con&s;cience to Lye or Cheat for advantage. The Capital Vices are Sloth and Idlene&s;s, Cheating and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s; prone they are al&s;o to a Sin of Frailty (as they term it) and La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, which appears too much in their Common Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trade</HI> of the Countrey is well known, and for the mo&s;t part unlawful. Of all the <HI>Colonies</HI> this has been mo&s;t prejudicial to the <HI>Kings Cu&s;tomes,</HI> and the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> which hath been &s;ufficiently proved again&s;t them. Of them&s;elves they bring no con&s;iderable <HI>Ravenue</HI> to the Crown, of which more in the <HI>Re|marks,</HI> as al&s;o of their famous <HI>Colledge,</HI> and great works of <HI>Evan|gelizing Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The Laws of <HI>England</HI> are of no Credit among them, and when pleaded in their Courts are little regarded; but they have Compo&s;ed a body of Laws for them&s;elves, which are Printed together in a thin Folio. The Book is &s;carce to be had here in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore not at all taken notice of; otherwi&s;e it would move the Publick Indignation to &s;ee how the Fortunes and Lives of their Maje&s;ties Subjects are di&s;po&s;ed of by a Combination of Men, that think them&s;elves Wi&s;er than the Parliament of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Government was fir&s;t by way of Charter, which was chiefly Managed by the <HI>Teachers.</HI> The&s;e by their power with the people, made all the Magi&s;trates, and kept them &s;o en|tirely under Obedience, that they dur&s;t not act without them. So that whenever any thing &s;trange or unu&s;ual, was brought before them, they would not determine the matter without con&s;ulting the <HI>Teacher.</HI> For &s;hould any be &s;o &s;turdy as to pre&s;ume to act of him&s;elf without taking their advice and di|rection, he might be &s;ure of it, his Magi&s;tracy ended with the Year.</P>
<P>The World, ju&s;tly condemns the U&s;urped Power of the <HI>Popi&s;h Clergy</HI> over the <HI>Laity,</HI> yet the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> even in <HI>Italy,</HI> have not a greater <HI>A&s;cendant</HI> over the People than the <HI>Teachers</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>And that they might perpetuate the Government to them|&s;elves, they &s;o brought things about (as indeed they might do what they li&s;ted) that it was pa&s;t into a Law, that none &s;hould have any thing to do with the Government, that was not a Freeman of the Country; and none &s;hould be made a
<PB N="9" REF="5">Freeman, who was not in full Communion with their Churches, that is, who &s;hould not in all points be of the Preachers Opi|nion.</P>
<P>The way of making Freeman was after this manner. He that de&s;ired the Freedom of the Country came, and made known his reque&s;t to the Court; whom th&ocirc; never &s;o &s;ober in Life and Conver&s;ation, if he favoured not the <HI>Independent</HI> per|&s;ua&s;ion, he was certainly rejected, either as an Enemy to the Church or State; But whoever came with &s;uch powerful Cre|dentials as the&s;e, <HI>The Bearer is a godly Man, and in Communi|on with &s;uch a Church, Given under my hand N. N.</HI> or <HI>under the hands of his Deacons.</HI> Such a Man needed not to &s;eek for other Arguments to gain the favour of the Magi&s;trates, for without any other formality he might be &s;ure to have the grant of his Freedom. For this rea&s;on many formal Hypo|crites, who were ambitious of Honour and Preferment, would work them&s;elves into the favour of the <HI>Teachers.</HI> To this end, be&s;ides many co&s;tly Treats and Pre&s;ents, they would in the Meeting-Hou&s;es frame Stories of their Conver&s;ion, and enter in|to Church-Covenant (as the Phra&s;e is) and make a <HI>long Cant</HI> how the Work of Grace was wrought on their hearts, by the Sermon or Pains of one of the Leading <HI>Teachers.</HI> Whereupon &s;uch were admitted into the Fraternity, and made Church-Mem|bers, and there they were in a fair way to the highe&s;t Pre|ferment.</P>
<P>It was plea&s;ant to behold poor <HI>Coblers</HI> and pitiful <HI>Mecha|nicks,</HI> which had neither Hou&s;e nor Land, &s;truting and making no mean Figure at their Elections; and &s;ome of the riche&s;t Merchants and wealthie&s;t People &s;tand by as in&s;ignificant Cy|phers; or in the words of one of their own, who thought he cha|ractariz'd them ingeniou&s;ly, as &s;o many A&s;&s;es to bear the Loads that &s;hould be laid upon them.</P>
<P>In the late Ri&s;ing there were many Divi&s;ions among the People, what Government to erect. Many of the Council (as they term'd them&s;elves) were for declaring them&s;elves a Free-State. But Mr. <HI>Stoughton</HI> well knowing their weakne&s;s, would not Sub&s;cribe the Summons &s;ent to the Governour, unle&s;s depen|dance on the Crown of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be in&s;erted into the De|claration. Some were for a Court-Martial and Military-Go|vernment, becau&s;e what they got by the Sword, they ought to keep by the Sword. Others were for Election of Governour
<PB N="10" REF="6">and Magi&s;trates by all the People. But the <HI>Teachers,</HI> who all along were the Chief in the Councils, and carried the Ballance in their hands, di&s;lik'd &s;uch Propo&s;als, for then they &s;hould lo&s;e their Power; and therefore they moved, that the old Goyer|nour and Magi&s;trates formerly of their own making might be re&s;tored, with the Addition of &s;ome confiding Men, whom they had proved and found Faithful, to &s;upply the Vacancies of tho&s;e Magi&s;trates which were dead; to whom all bowed and paid Obedience: So that now the Government is &s;afely lodged in the hands of the <HI>Teachers</HI> again.</P>
<P>'Tis hard to give an acccount of the Religion of the Colo|ny where &s;o many know not what Religion they are of, and when demanded a rea&s;on of their Faith, can &s;ay little more than that they are Hearers of Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> or Members of the <HI>Old Church,</HI> or under the watch of the <HI>South Meeting-Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But having promi&s;ed an account of the Country, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that I &s;hould give &s;ome account of their Religion, becau&s;e it is a large Topick of their di&s;cour&s;e, makes the great noi&s;e among the People.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Setlers were a good &s;erious &s;ort of People who had the fear of God before their eyes, and firm a&s;&s;urance of his providence, otherwi&s;e they never had undertaken that ha|zardous de&s;ign. I cannot &s;ay what per&s;ua&s;ion they were of, but this I know they &s;til'd them&s;elves Children of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and counted it their glory to be called after her Name; and at their departure from hence, in all humble duty they de&s;ired the Prayers of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> and his <HI>Clergy,</HI> for them, who came out of their own bo&s;oms, and who &s;hould continually offer up their Prayers to the Throne of Grace for the Pro&s;perity of the Church. All which with a great deal more to the &s;ame effect was written in a Letter &s;ent to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> from on board the <HI>Arabella,</HI> and &s;ub|&s;cribed by <HI>Governour, Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>But they had not been long in the <HI>New World,</HI> before all forts of People flock'd over unto them, of as different Princi|ples as places; which cau&s;ed no &s;mall trouble to the Inhabl|tants, for one was for this Model, another for that Plat|form; &s;o that they were like to be &s;cattered and de&s;troyed by Religion, which &s;hould have united and pre&s;erved them.</P>
<P>It was therefore thought nece&s;&s;ary &s;omething &s;hould be E&s;ta; bli&s;hed, that they might not be always a confu&s;ed <HI>Babel:</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="6">Whereupon after much Strife and Contention they &s;etled on <HI>Independency,</HI> which hath indeed a &s;hew of much Purity and Ho|line&s;s, but hath in truth that which is highly Super&s;titious, as Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> one of their own, declared in a Publick Convoca|tion; and as another <HI>Non-Conformi&s;t</HI> Mini&s;ter term'd it <HI>Paga|nizing Independency.</HI> For three fourths of the Country never participate of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> and if any &s;hould beg it, as for the Salvation of his Soul, yet he could not obtain his re|que&s;t without coming up to their Terms, and telling Stories of the time of this Conver&s;ion, and when the Work of Grace was wrought upon his heart. Even in the &s;pace of little more than one Generation, near one half of the People are <HI>&V;n-baptized,</HI> and let Parents do what they can for their Children, let them give never &s;o good account of their Faith, and live never &s;o uprightly towards God and Man, yet their Children &s;hall not be admitted to Bapti&s;m, unle&s;s one of the Parents be of <HI>their Communion,</HI> and promi&s;es to walk after the <HI>Church Covenant;</HI> &s;o that in a few Ages by their <HI>Independent</HI> Practice, <HI>Pagani&s;m</HI> will a &s;econd time overcome the Land, and there will be as much need of <HI>Evan|gelizing</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as there is now of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>This overtoping Per&s;ua&s;ion would have none to grow under it, if continual droping could prevent it; yet its natural I&s;&s;ue <HI>Anabapti&s;m</HI> &s;prouts out amain. However the <HI>Independants</HI> have treated the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> very unkindly, fined them for not com|ing to the <HI>Independent A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> nailed up the Doors of their Meeting-Hou&s;es, and turned them into the Streets.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is another Sect arrived to great Perfection, who were for none but <HI>King Je&s;us.</HI> Al&s;o there are <HI>Quakers,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Severities that they have &s;uffered among them, all the&s;e having &s;uffered Bani&s;hment formerly, and &s;ome of them having been put to Death for their Religion.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and many other U&s;urpations and Stretches of Go|vernment, a <HI>Scire facias</HI> was i&s;&s;ued out of the High Court of Chancery, and timely notice given them for their ap|pearance. (But they well knowing their own Guiltine&s;s) never took care that any &s;hould appear and defend the Suit, but &s;ent their <HI>Agents</HI> with a Power to lavi&s;h out four or five thou&s;and pounds to corrupt Ju&s;tice. Whereupon after the&s;e delays had continued for &s;ome years, at la&s;t Judgement was entred again&s;t them; and the then King <HI>Charles</HI> II. re&s;umed
<PB N="12" REF="7">their Charter-Grant, that their hands might be tyed up from per&s;ecuting their Brethren and doing more Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Afterward in the Year 1686. Sir. <HI>Edmond Andro&s;s</HI> came o|ver with a Commi&s;&s;ion to Govern the Countrey, and during the time that he was in the Government (as it will certainly appear when the matter comes to be examined by indifferent Judges) he carried him&s;elf courteou&s;ly and obligingly to all, gave an excellent Patern of Sobriety and Temperance, and in all things perform'd the Duty of a good Governour.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e he would not let the <HI>Teachers</HI> have their Wills in all things, and follow their directions in every matter; there|fore they rai&s;ed fal&s;e Accu&s;ations again&s;t him, le&s;&s;ened his good Actions, and mi&s;repre&s;ented his <HI>Government</HI> to the People as <HI>Illegal</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary:</HI> and not contented herewith, the <HI>Heads</HI> of the <HI>Party</HI> came over hither into <HI>England,</HI> and charged him with <HI>Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Violence,</HI> made Addre&s;&s;es to King <HI>James,</HI> promi&s;ing to do what&s;oever he would have them, and to be in&s;trumental with their <HI>Party</HI> in <HI>England</HI> to pull down the Fence again&s;t <HI>Popery,</HI> and <HI>Repeal</HI> the <HI>Penal Laws.</HI> Parti|cularly they Courted <HI>William Pen,</HI> and made their Humble Applications to Father <HI>Petre,</HI> to have the Governour recall'd and their Old Charter re&s;tored.</P>
<P>But when all the&s;e accu&s;ed Methods proved ineffectual, what the <HI>Quaker</HI> could not do, and what the <HI>Popi&s;h Prie&s;t</HI> would not, impatient of any delays, they attempted them&s;elves on the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> in a Tumultuous manner, they wre&s;ted the Government out of Sir <HI>Edmond's</HI> hand, made him Pri&s;oner, and &s;o they did all others of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> as by Law E&s;tabli&s;hed, who were in any Office <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Military,</HI> com|mitting him and &s;ome other Gentlemen to the <HI>Fort,</HI> others to the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> and more to the <HI>Common Goal.</HI></P>
<P>The particulars of this Tran&s;action may in convenient time be made publick. In the mean while, I beg of you, and of all other Gentlemen, to whom you &s;hall think fit to communi|cate this Paper, that you would be plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend your Judgements concerning the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Complainants,</HI> till the Matter, in Que&s;tion, comes to be heard before its proper Judges.
