But they took no notice at the &s;ame time, that <HI>France</HI> would come to no agreement: But upon con|ditions which were not only di&s;honourable to the Empire, but tended al&s;o to the utter ruine of the Emperor. For the King of <HI>France</HI> would have approved by a Treaty all the infractions which he had made of the Peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and moreover certain preten&s;ions &s;atisfied, which I can &s;carce forbear terming ridiculous, were I not withheld by the re&s;pect which is due to what|&s;oever comes from Crowned Heads.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>How&s;oever, the Emperor im|patiently expected &s;ome news from <HI>Caprara,</HI> when this Am|ba&s;&s;ador (deceiv'd by the ar|tifices of the Grand Vi&s;ier, who was wholly &s;et upon amu&s;ing him with hopes of peace, whil&s;t he thought on nothing but War,) advertized him he doubted not but to accompli&s;h his bu&s;ine&s;s; which fill'd the Emperor and the whole Court with joy.</P>
<P>In effect, although he wil|lingly would have turn'd his Arms again&s;t this common Enemy of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> yet knowing the de&s;igns of <HI>France,</HI> which a&s;pir'd of late to the Empire, th'intere&s;t of his Fa|mily made him re&s;pect it as an enemy far more dangerous, than the <HI>Turk</HI> could be; who
<PB N="5" REF="4"> at farthe&s;t expected but one place or two, whereas the other would &s;wallow up the whole.</P>
<P>A report being &s;pread in the month of <HI>January,</HI> that the King of <HI>France</HI> would encamp 50 Thou&s;and men on the <HI>Sa|on,</HI> and almo&s;t as many on the <HI>Saar,</HI> oblig'd the Emperor to &s;ecure the <HI>Rhyne.</HI> And altho' he had only words as yet from the <HI>Turks,</HI> he cho&s;e rather to ungari&s;on <HI>Hungary,</HI> than ex|po&s;e his Country to the in|va&s;ion of the <HI>French.</HI> Count <HI>Mansfeld,</HI> who was with the King of <HI>France</HI> from the Em|peror, had in the mean time orders to ob&s;erve what&s;oever pa&s;t: But that Court taking plea&s;ure in giving every day new fears, he could &s;end no
<PB N="6" REF="5"> certainer news than what were commonly reported, to wit, that the King would carry the War into <HI>Germany</HI> the next &s;pring, if the Emporor gran|ted him not what&s;oever he de|manded.</P>
<P>Altho' perhaps what I now mention'd, may appear di&s;tant enough from my &s;ubject, which is to relate the &s;ucce&s;s of the War, which the <HI>Turks</HI> made with the Emperor, yet will it not appear &s;o to tho&s;e that &s;hall take the pains, to con&s;ider how nece&s;&s;ary 'tis to &s;hew what the Emperor had to fear on the &s;ide of the <HI>French,</HI> to the end he may not be blam'd for not immediately employing all his forces to repel the Infidels; neither will it be ami&s;s to take notice by
<PB N="7" REF="5"> the way, that &s;etting a&s;ide Religion, 'twas more the Em|perors intere&s;t to oppo&s;e this power than that of the <HI>Turks: Becau&s;e the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the hou&s;e of</HI> France, <HI>is the undoubted ruine of the hou&s;e of</HI> Au&s;tria. How&s;oever the Emperor &s;ee|ing the effect was far from the hope he had conceived from the promi&s;es of <HI>Caprara,</HI> cau&s;ed new levies to be rais'd in all the hereditary Provinces, and &s;ollicited the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes to enter into a con|federacy with him again&s;t this common enemy of <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI> made an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive League with him: Several other Prin|ces promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, &s;ome with men, others with money, and in &s;hort, great
<PB N="8" REF="6"> preparations on all hands were made for War, &s;eeing it could not be avoided. In the mean time it being known at <HI>Rome</HI> what pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>France,</HI> the Pope &s;ent a Brief to the King, wherein having given him all the qualities due to a great Prince, as indeed he is, he exhorted him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor, or at lea&s;t not hin|der others from doing it.</P>
<P>In the mean time great care was taken to fortify <HI>Waag</HI> and <HI>Raab,</HI> the keeping of which were entru&s;ted to the <HI>Hungarians;</HI> it being hoped, the &s;eeing, not only their e|&s;tates, but likewi&s;e the lives of their Wives and Children were concerned, they could not but &s;toutly re&s;i&s;it th'enemy.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P><HI>Comorra</HI> and <HI>Raab,</HI> being lookt upon as the bulwarks of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> were carefully for|tified: And it being &s;uppo&s;ed the enemy would not leave two places of that importance behind them, to come and be|&s;iege <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nna,</HI> there was le&s;s care than ought to be taken in &s;trengthening this la&s;t place: &s;o that when the <HI>Turks</HI> ap|pear'd before it, the ditches were not &s;o much as clean&s;ed, nor the ba&s;tions repaired. Yet both the&s;e defects were amen|ded under the favour of the Cannon and Muskets, which kept th' Infidels from di&s;tur|bing the workmen. But that which facilitated the perfor|mance of this, was, that the enemies not being able to bring their Cannon over the <HI>Danube,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="7"> by rea&s;on of <HI>Raab,</HI> and <HI>Co|morra,</HI> which belong'd to the Emperor, they needed much time to draw it by land, the ways being broken in &s;everal places, which hindred them from planting them &s;o &s;oon as their occa&s;ion required.</P>
<P>To mention every thing in order, I &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ay, that the Emperor &s;eeing the <HI>Turks</HI> had &s;et up the <HI>Hor&s;e-tayle,</HI> which is to them a &s;ignal of War, and moreover exerci&s;ed &s;everal ho&s;tilities on the frontiers, he held a Council of War, re&s;olving to prevent their de|&s;igns. 'Twas determin'd in this Council, that the Troops &s;hould &s;peedily leave their Garri&s;ons, and make their <HI>rendezvous</HI> a league di&s;tant from <HI>Presburg,</HI> to march thence
<PB N="11" REF="7"> to <HI>Newhaw&s;el,</HI> which was in|tended to be be&s;ieged, in hope 'twould be taken before the <HI>Turks</HI> could &s;uccor it.</P>
<P>The Command of the Army was given to the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain;</HI> for be&s;ides the con&s;i|dence which the Emperor put in him, he &s;hould by this means take away all cau&s;es of jealou&s;ie from &s;everal others, who would not have been con|tented, had they been oblig'd to obey any one but the Em|perors Brother-in-Law. In the mean while the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain,</HI> who was &s;ick during the whole Winter, and &s;carce yet fully recovered; could not come &s;o &s;oon to the Army, and indeed made it a month before his arrival, which oc|ca&s;ion'd much mi&s;chief: For
<PB N="12" REF="8"> whil&s;t he was recovering from his &s;ickne&s;s, the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>New|hau&s;el</HI> had time to fortify the place, and to prepare him&s;elf for defence.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Gran,</HI> who likewi&s;e might fear the Em|perors Arms, took care where|in&s;oever he was concerned, and agreed with the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> to &s;end him a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, if he &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;et upon, as al&s;o to receive the &s;ame from him, if <HI>Gran</HI> chanced to be fir&s;t attackt by the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>Things being in this po&s;ture; when the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> came to the Army, and made the review of it in the pre|fence of the Emperor, Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and &s;everal other Princes, he cau&s;ed it to march
<PB N="13" REF="8"> between <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> as if it had been &s;till uncertain which of the&s;e places he min|ded to attack. About &s;ix leagues off both the&s;e Cities he &s;eem'd to be determin'd for <HI>Gran:</HI> For having made a detache|ment of 6000 hor&s;e, he cau|&s;ed them to march on the &s;ide of <HI>Gran,</HI> which made the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> believe that 'twas not he, whom he de&s;ign'd. In the mean time to &s;atisfie the agreement made betwixt 'em, as afore mention'd, he &s;ent out about 2000 men of his Garri&s;on, with orders to enter <HI>Gran.</HI> But as &s;oon as ever he that Commanded the detachem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> knew they were en|tered, he turn'd &s;hort off to <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> which he inve&s;ted.</P>

Yet did they carry away a great number of Pri&s;oners, who&s;e heads they cau&s;ed to be im|mediately cut off.</P>
<P>And to affright us the more, planted them along the walls of the Town, which was an object of great grief to &s;everal, who continually be|held the lo&s;s they had &s;uffered, of their brother, friend, or near kin&s;man. This happy &s;ucce&s;s encouraged afre&s;h the <HI>Turks</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="10"> to make another &s;ally the next morning, in which having likewi&s;e taken &s;ome Pri&s;oners, they u&s;ed 'em after the &s;ame manner as the former.</P>
<P>This did not &s;o damp the Courage of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> as to hinder 'em from making u&s;e of it as a motive to revenge, and of more care for the future. Our batteries then were rai&s;ed in a &s;hort time, the trench opened, and there was never more hopes of a happier &s;uc|ce&s;s, when there aro&s;e a re|port thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ghout the whole Camp, That the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> openly complained, that Prince <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rman</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> Pre|&s;ident of the Council of War, which was at <HI>Vienna</HI> with the Emperor, kindered nece&s;&s;aries being &s;ent him for the &s;iege,
<PB N="17" REF="10"> hoping thereby to make him lo&s;e his reputation, and ren|der him&s;elf more con&s;iderable. In fine, the&s;e reports were &s;o common in the Army, that coming to the Ears of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden Herman</HI>'s Nephew, he had &s;ome words about it with the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> And indeed 'twas well known of a long time, that Prince <HI>Herman</HI> had a &s;e|cret jealou&s;ie of the Duke and 'twas the opinion of &s;everal, that he would not have been much troubled had his undertakings prov'd &s;uc|ce&s;sle&s;s. But in this occa&s;ion, not only the wellfare of the Em|pire, but moreover of all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> being concerned, 'twas charitably judg'd this hatred was &s;omewhat abated,
<PB N="18" REF="11"> if not wholly extingui&s;ht. But 'twas afterwards apparent how greatly &s;uch as thus rea&s;oned were deceived, when they came to u&s;e the ammunition.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Trench was well advanced, and there were great hopes for us, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> receives an order from the Emperor, &s;igned with his own hand, by which he was enjoyn'd to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and put forces into <HI>Raab, Comorra,</HI> and <HI>Presburg.</HI> 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to relate the vexation which &s;eiz'd the Duke at this Command, the whole fault of which he ca&s;t on the Prince of <HI>Baden:</HI> But not able to di&s;pence with his obedience, he retir'd from the Town, and drew up his Army in Battalia, &s;hewing by
<PB N="19" REF="11"> his countenance, that obedi|ence was the only cau&s;e of his retreat. In fine, when he was to depart, he lodged &s;ome infantry in &s;everal hou&s;es, which were about a quarter of a league di&s;tant from the Town, hoping in ca&s;e he &s;hould be follow'd, not only this in|fantry would favour his re|treat; but moreover, &s;eeing the enemy mu&s;t pa&s;s near the&s;e hou&s;es, tho&s;e whom he left behind in 'em might attack 'em in the Flank, and whil&s;t they were &s;urpriz'd with the fir&s;t Charge, the cavalry which was at the rereguard, &s;hould turn head upon them, and ea&s;ily defeat 'em.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid, but that this order was given according to the rules of War, there be|ing
<PB N="20" REF="12"> all the likelihood in the world of a &s;utable &s;ucce&s;s. But the rai&s;ing of the &s;iege had &s;o di&s;couraged the Troops, that when the Infidels appear'd, the rereguard doubled their pace, in&s;tead of facing about, leaving tho&s;e who were in the hou&s;es without any hope of &s;uccour. They defended them|&s;elves, as well as they could, for an hour or two, but the place being not tenable, they were forced to yield to a grea|ter power, &s;o that tho&s;e who e&s;caped from the combat, were all made Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>This did little advantage them, for the Ba&s;&s;a no &s;ooner was entered into <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> but he cau&s;ed their heads to be cut off, and planted on the ramparts of the Town, with
<PB N="21" REF="12"> tho&s;e who dyed with their Arms in their hands, as if he meant his cruelty &s;hould add to his glory. The Count <HI>de Taxis,</HI> who was of one of the be&s;t Families in <HI>Spain,</HI> and who&s;e Ance&s;tors have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed time out of mind the Office of <HI>Great Ma&s;ter of the Po&s;ts of that Kingdom,</HI> was one of tho&s;e mi&s;erable victims.</P>
<P>The Army, in the mean while held on the way to the I&s;le of <HI>Schut,</HI> and as &s;he retir'd, news came of a greater mi&s;|fortune, than the rai&s;ing the &s;iege of <HI>Newhau&s;el.</HI> I mean of the Trea&s;on of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> that were in the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Vaag,</HI> who in&s;tead of defending it, as was expected, joyned them&s;elves to Count <HI>Teckely,</HI> chief of the Male-contents of
<PB N="22" REF="13"> <HI>Hungary,</HI> after they had Char|ged the other Troops, which were with them, for the de|fence of the pa&s;&s;age. I cannot expre&s;s, nor nobody with me, how great was the Armys con|&s;ternation at the fir&s;t news of this mi&s;hap. For every one imagining already to &s;ee the <HI>Turks</HI> at his elbow, thought of nothing but how to e&s;cape them; and as if they had nei|ther Arms nor Hands to op|po&s;e them, they had the victory already yielded 'em without &s;triking a &s;troke. But that which augmented &s;till each ones fear, was, that of every party which was &s;ent out from the re&s;t of the Army, there return'd at mo&s;t not above half, and generally in bad order.</P>

<P>In fine, after they had kill'd about 800, they fell on the Baggage, which &s;aved the re&s;t of the Army.

<P>He was become de&s;perate by what had happen'd to him, and his affliction made him &s;carce known, &s;o greatly was he alter'd by it. For be&s;ides the danger, wherein all the Empire lay, (he knew that the <HI>good and bad &s;ucce&s;s of affairs were attributed only to the Com|manders,</HI>)

As to the two o|thers, they were plac'd again&s;t two other works, which de|fended the City on the &s;ide of the Scotch and Red Gates, where the Grand Vi&s;ier de|&s;ign'd
<PB N="54" REF="32"> to make his attack.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever the&s;e bat|teries were fini&s;h'd, they were &s;o well &s;upply'd, that the Town receiv'd a thou&s;and &s;hot the fir&s;t day, and more than 16000 the two next: All the City Cannon were in the&s;e 3 days di&s;mounted, and great numbers were wounded, with &s;everal Officers kill'd in their attendance on it. This furious beginning fill'd the whole City with terrour, which was encreas'd by the <HI>Bombs,</HI> that &s;et &s;everal parts on fire, and that were with great difficulty quench'd.</P>
<P>The Citizens, who were not us'd to the&s;e kind of di&s;|a&s;ters, had already lo&s;t above half their Courage, which they &s;hew'd before the &s;iege
<PB N="55" REF="32"> began. And Count <HI>Starenberg</HI> knowing there were not wan|ting &s;ome who began to talk of a &s;urrender, caus'd a Gallows to be &s;et up in the Market|place; &s;wearing in the pre|&s;ence of &s;ome of the princi|pal Citizens, that he would hang thereon the fir&s;t that &s;hould mention any &s;uch mat|ter.</P>
<P>This &s;everity, which was not un&s;ea&s;onable, retain'd the mo&s;t fearful in their duty and obedience. But le&s;t the Citi|zens &s;hould infect the Soldiers with the &s;ame fears, he hindred, as much as in him lay all com|munication with 'em. And although he fir&s;t thought to di&s;tribute &s;ome of his Soldiers among&s;t the City Trained-bands, to make them the
<PB N="56" REF="33"> more hardy and expert, yet he chang'd his re&s;olution, le&s;t as I now mention'd, the fear of the one, &s;hould le&s;&s;en the Courage of the other.</P>
<P>The Emperor, who was at <HI>Pa&s;&s;am,</HI> as I already ob&s;erv'd, receiv'd in the mean time me&s;&s;engers every day from the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who inform'd him what he could of the &s;iege, of which he was but indiffe|rently inform'd him&s;elf. For two men which Count <HI>Staren|berg</HI> &s;ent him, were taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> as they endeavour'd to pa&s;s over to his Camp, and were at the &s;ame time hang'd, for having Letters found about 'em. He could not then know more, than what common fame brought him, which took plea|&s;ure to make things wor&s;e than
<PB N="57" REF="33"> they were, every one regula|ting the pre&s;ent, by what had pa&s;t, which indeed was not very fortunate.</P>
<P>The Emperor was in a mor|tal angui&s;h touching what would become of him. For on one hand the <HI>mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> having made his Troops to march toward the fron|tiers of <HI>Germany</HI> came thither in per&s;on, and 'twas reported his de&s;igns were again&s;t <HI>Cologn,</HI> or <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> having Pen&s;io|ners, as well in one place as the other. In effect in the latter of the&s;e one <HI>Nigrelly</HI> was &s;u&s;pected, and in the former the whole Town.</P>
<P>Moreover the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;o dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, that he was given over by his Phy|&s;icians; whereupon the Em|peror
<PB N="58" REF="34"> con&s;ider'd in ca&s;e he dyed, the King of <HI>France</HI> would have &s;everal claims to decide with him, and fall boldly on the Empire, which perhaps otherwi&s;e he dur&s;t not at|tempt, le&s;t he &s;hould draw on him the hatred of the Chri|&s;tian Princes.</P>
<P>Being troubled with the&s;e fears, he receiv'd two grateful me&s;&s;engers the one informing him the King of <HI>France</HI> was return'd home, and the other that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was on his recovery. He wanted only to hear the &s;iege of <HI>Vienna</HI> went ill on the Vi&s;iers &s;ide, but was inform'd on the contrary, that the <HI>Turks</HI> every day recruited their Camp, with fre&s;h Troops, and their endeavours grew e|very
<PB N="59" REF="34"> moment more &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Town: This news bani&s;ht the joy from his heart which he had conceiv'd at the former. And forgetting not to ha&s;ten the &s;uccors which he was promis'd from &s;everal parts, he &s;ent expre&s;&s;es into all Courts to repre&s;ent the nece&s;&s;ity he had of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to excite his Allies to a &s;peedy contri|bution.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Seppeville,</HI> Envoy from the King of <HI>France</HI> to the Em|peror, was the per&s;on from whom the bad news of the &s;iege was &s;ooner learnt than from any other. And he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s, to retail it out to every one, although this made him &s;u&s;pected by the Emperor; &s;eeing he di&s;patcht
<PB N="60" REF="35"> four me&s;&s;ages in one week to the King his Ma&s;ter. He hop'd perhaps by this means to give him a great deal of &s;atisfaction, but he at the &s;ame time in&s;pir'd the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> with a de|&s;ire to &s;ignalize him&s;elf again&s;t the Infidels, who was more|over di&s;contented at the Kings giving to his prejudice the Government of <HI>Languedoc</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Maine,</HI> his natural Son; which had been promis'd him in e&s;pou&s;ing <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Blois.</HI> He communicated his de&s;ign only to Prince <HI>Eu|genus</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Brother to the Chevalier of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who was kill'd in the &s;ervice of the Emperor, as I have already mention'd, le&s;t in making more acquainted with it, &s;ome one &s;hould di&s;cover it to the King.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="35">
<P>He re&s;olved to part from the Court, on <HI>Monday</HI> the 25th of <HI>July,</HI> and having commanded his Coach-man to tarry for him at the Pallace Royal, where was Mon&s;ieur the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> lately come from <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> he mounted on Hor&s;e|back with Prince <HI>Eugenus,</HI> attended only by a Page, but without a Livery, and took Po&s;t for the Road of <HI>Senlis.</HI> About ten miles from <HI>Paris,</HI> a Po&s;tillion knew him, &s;o that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> having &s;poken to him, and the other giving him his Title, the Prince askt him whether he knew him, and the other an&s;wering he did, he gave him four Pi&s;tols, not to di&s;cover which way he went, &amp; changing Hats with him, thought he might
<PB N="62" REF="36"> thus pa&s;s on unknown. But this fellow had no &s;ooner left him, but carries the Hat to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Conde,</HI> which he gave to <HI>Gourville</HI> intendant of Mon&s;ieur the Prince, Uncle to the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI></P>
<P>They were all till then in great trouble, for his Coach|man who had waited for him at the Pallace Royal till eleven at night, had &s;et all the hou&s;e in Alarum. And it being known, he had left the Court, this troubled Ma|dam the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conte,</HI> but yet not &s;o much as the King, who could not imagine what was become of him. The King had &s;ent word hereof to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who was then at <HI>Paris</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Fuiel|lade,</HI> and this Prince who was
<PB N="63" REF="36"> ready to return to <HI>Chantilly,</HI> came to him, to remain a&s;ure|ty for his Nephews Fidelity. In the mean time tho&s;e that believed they knew him, &s;aid he was not much troubled at this di&s;parition, which &s;hewed the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had cou|rage, and could not &s;uffer the Duke of <HI>Maine</HI> to be preferred before him without Re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>Immediately as &s;oon as 'twas certain at Court what Road he had taken, the King &s;ent &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers after him, and gave one of them, who&s;e name was <HI>Saintraillees,</HI> and belonged to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> a Letter for him, written with his own hand, in which he called him his <HI>Son;</HI> but which at the &s;ame time told him, <HI>that if he return'd
<PB N="64" REF="37"> not &s;peedily, hee'd never &s;ee him.</HI> Whil&s;t 'twas doubted, con&s;i|dering his circum&s;tances, whe|ther he would obey or no, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;ent him Let|ters of Exchange for twenty thou&s;and Crowns, knowing he had carried but 600 Pi&s;tols with him; and that his occa&s;ions would require them if he went further. But this being an encouragement to him to con|tinue his Journey, rather than break it, gave every man oc|ca&s;ion to believe, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> would not be much troubled &s;hould he not &s;hew him&s;elf &s;o obedient.</P>
<P>This Princes departure, to &s;ignalize him&s;elf again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> (for 'twas not doubted but 'twas his de&s;ign) gave ample matter of di&s;cour&s;e to
<PB N="65" REF="37"> the people, &s;ome attributing this re&s;olution to the rea&s;on which I before related, others to a dome&s;tick grievance, which was muttered &s;oon after his Marriage.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Saintrailles,</HI> he arrived at <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;&s;els</HI> the &s;ame day he parted from <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> And being informed the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> only pa&s;t thorow it, and had taken the road of <HI>Co|logn,</HI> he got to <HI>Namur,</HI> whence he came down by the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> to <HI>Liege,</HI> where he re&s;ted a|while: and taking po&s;t thence u&s;ed &s;uch diligence, that he overtook the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> who &s;eeing in the Kings Letter, the threatnings he u&s;ed, he re|&s;olved on obeying him, &s;o that having embraced Prince <HI>Eu|genus,</HI> of whom the King made
<PB N="66" REF="38"> no mention, and who was re|&s;olv'd to continue his Journey, and given him a Diamond of great value, he lea&s;urely re|turned toward <HI>France,</HI> &s;ending <HI>Saintrailles</HI> before him, who long'd to give the King an ac|count of his Journey. But <HI>Saintrailles</HI> found the King in &s;uch a &s;urprize by the Death of the Queen, who dyed in a manner &s;uddenly, that he had &s;carce lea&s;ure to think on the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI> Yet was he well enough plea&s;ed at his obe|dience, &s;eeing it much con|cerned him, that whil&s;t he en|deavored at the ruin of the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> &s;he &s;hould not have a Prince of the Blood in her hands, for whom &s;he might expect a great Ran&s;om, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he could not &s;o
<PB N="67" REF="38"> greatly exa&s;perate his di&s;con|tents, to make him u&s;e his Arms again&s;t his Allegiance.</P>
<P>The affairs of the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> bearing &s;ome Relation to the &s;ubject I handle, I hope will be a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for the digre&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall now return to the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> continued with &s;uc|ce&s;s, &s;ometimes favourable and &s;ometimes contrary. <HI>Sta|remberg</HI> &s;eeing they advanced in their works, &s;till made &s;ome Sallies, in one of which he had &s;o briskly charged 'em, that if all their Hor&s;e had not come into their a&s;&s;i&s;tance with the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> he had made a grievous rout among&s;t them and their works. But finding the match to grow unequal, he &s;ounded a retreat, and what|&s;oever
<PB N="68" REF="39"> good order he ob&s;erved, yet did he lo&s;e &s;everal Officers of note, and no &s;mall number of common Soldiers.</P>
<P>Soon after this he di&s;covers a dangerous enterprize, begun by two Chri&s;tians again&s;t the City, one of which was an <HI>Albanian</HI> by Nation, and the other of <HI>Candia.</HI> Their de&s;ign was to &s;et fire on &s;ome parts of the Town, under pretence of quenching that which often was fired by the Enemies Bombs. But there being found Straw, in&s;tead of water in their hands, they were apprehended, and put on the Rack, where confe&s;&s;ing their crime, they were puni&s;hed as they de&s;er|ved. Their heads were after|wards &s;ever'd from their bodies and &s;et upon the wall, not only
<PB N="69" REF="39"> that they without might know their &s;ecret practi&s;es were di&s;|covered, but al&s;o to keep tho&s;e within from the like Trea&s;ons.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army receiving no recruits, but what were brought by Camels and Waggons, did not &s;o abound, but that they were often in want. Forrage more|over became thin near the Army, and therefore they were forced to go far. In this nece&s;&s;ity the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> &s;ent part of his Hor&s;e on the &s;ide of <HI>Raab,</HI> and cau&s;ed a party of Foot to come to the Camp, which lay on that &s;ide the Country, of which he had more need than of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>With this Foot which were all in breath the de&s;igns greatly
<PB N="68" REF="40"> advaneed. So that the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf no further from the Counter&s;carp than ten paces, re&s;olved to attack it after he had &s;prung a mine, in the Ruins of which he thought he might &s;ecurely lodge. But the mine in&s;tead of damnify|ing the be&s;ieged, falling on the &s;ide of the aggre&s;&s;ors, &s;everal that had advanced to be ready for the a&s;&s;ault were de&s;troyed in its Ruins. Who&s;e places being fill'd up by others, the Counter&s;carp was attackt with &s;uch Vigor, that 'twas wre&s;ted by the Swords point. But <HI>Staremberg,</HI> who con&s;idered that if he gave the <HI>Turks</HI> time to lodge them&s;elves there t'would be the lo&s;s of the Town, &s;ent thither fre&s;h men, which after a &s;harp di&s;pute on both &s;ides,
<PB N="71" REF="40"> drove the <HI>Turks</HI> thence, of whom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> they made a great Slaughter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> believing their honour was concerned to retake the Counter&s;carp, and better keep it than before, blew up another Mine, which proving more effectual than the former, made one part of the work fly up into the Air, together with &s;ome men that were upon it. Which daunting the Chri&s;tians courage, &s;everal began to faint and give way, whil&s;t the <HI>Jani|&s;aries</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Work|men, po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of the Counter&s;carp. They began at the &s;ame time to entrench them &s;elves, when <HI>Staremberg</HI> ha&s;ten|ing to his Men's a&s;&s;i&s;tance en|deavored to hinder 'em, and with his Sword in his hand
<PB N="72" REF="41"> vigorou&s;ly attackt them, min|gling &s;everal Granadiers with his Soldiers, in whom he had plac'd his chief confi|dence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> although they had not time to &s;helter them|&s;elves, yet fail'd not to receive him bravely, and having like|wi&s;e advanc'd their Granadiers, and being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the higher ground, they &s;carcely fir'd a|ny Granado which had not its effect: the heat of the Chri|&s;tians in&s;en&s;ibly abated, and <HI>Starenberg</HI> perceiving they gave ground, bethought him&s;elf of a retreat, plainly perceiving all his endeavours would be fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>In effect, <HI>Starenberg</HI> having made the Counter&s;carp on the &s;ide of the City to be Coun|ter-min'd,
<PB N="73" REF="41"> and his Mine being unperceiv'd, he had no &s;ooner retir'd far enough, but he blew it up, which cau&s;ed &s;everal <HI>Turks</HI> to caper in the Air. The <HI>Turks</HI> were by this put in great di&s;order, and <HI>Sta|renberg</HI> re&s;olving to make his advantage of it, return'd to the Charge before they could put them&s;elves in order. But a Battalion advancing to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the fight began a|gain with equal heat, but with a &s;ucce&s;s very different.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Turks</HI> finding them|&s;elves refre&s;h'd every moment, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing Courage, felt their forces augmenting, whil&s;t the Chri&s;tians who&s;e Ranks ap|pear'd thin, as any one might &s;ee by half a look, began to waver. In effect that which
<PB N="74" REF="42"> they had before their eyes, was a &s;pectacle terrible enough to a&s;toni&s;h the mo&s;t re&s;olute. For they could not make a &s;tep, but they mu&s;t pa&s;s over the bodies of their Compani|ons, the greate&s;t part of which, lying ga&s;ping for life, were trodden to death by the mul|titude.</P>
<P><HI>Starenberg</HI> &s;eeing that in&s;tead of re&s;toring good order a|mong&s;t his men, the di&s;order every moment encreas'd, chang'd the de&s;ign which he had of Re-taking the Counter|&s;carp, into that of pre&s;erving what had yet e&s;cap'd the Ene|mies hands. And having made his retreat, and taken great care of the wounded, he made a review of tho&s;e Forces he had left him; which
<PB N="75" REF="42"> he found dimini&s;h'd by a third part, not &s;o much by Sallies, and in this la&s;t occa&s;ion, as by the Dy&s;entery or Flux which began to rage in the Town, as well among&s;t the Citizens as Soldiers. In effect the fa|tigues together with the bad food they eat, had &s;o heated the bloud of mo&s;t of 'em, that they fell &s;ick every day. And it being impo&s;&s;ible for 'em af|ter this to do &s;ervice, the re&s;t, who&s;e wearine&s;s en|creas'd as fa&s;t as the number of the others dimini&s;h'd, were &s;oon in the &s;ame condition, or at lea&s;t &s;o tir'd out with la|bour and watching, that they were all ready to drop down as they march'd. <HI>Staren|berg</HI> found him&s;elf &s;truck with this di&s;temper, which
<PB N="76" REF="43"> ca&s;t 'em all into a general damp, it being obvious to every one that the Town could not be defended without him. It being fear'd if he continued his ince&s;&s;ant labours any lon|ger, he would fall at length under a dangerous malady, he therefore was entreated to give him&s;elf re&s;t, and tho&s;e of the principal Officers who &s;till enjoy'd their perfect health, offer'd the be&s;t of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to ea&s;e him. But <HI>Starenberg</HI> con&s;idering with a great deal of rea&s;on, that the condition wherein things lay, requir'd a greater indu&s;try than his own, would therefore tru&s;t to no body, &s;o that although he was very ill, yet did he order all things, as if he had been in perfect health.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="43">
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Turks</HI> having made them&s;elves ma|&s;ters of the Counter&s;carp, and repaired it the be&s;t they could, to keep it, brought up their Ordnance to it, and there planted 'em, which began to make a horrid confu&s;ion in the Town. They beat down above 300 Foot of the Wall, with one part of the Ravelin: And <HI>Starenberg</HI> de&s;irous to re|medy both the&s;e inconveni|encies, cau&s;ed a retrenchment to be drawn in the City, over again&s;t the Wall which the <HI>Turks</HI> had beat down. As to the Ravelin, he would have repaired it, but the enemies Cannon hinder'd him, and he was forc'd to content him|&s;elf with half fini&s;hing it.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="44">
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had in this time pitch'd his Camp between <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Crembs,</HI> on the other &s;ide the <HI>Danube,</HI> where he had a Bridge of Boats, over which he made his men pa&s;s as oft as they had occa&s;ion. He had &s;treng|thened the head of his Bridge with two good Forts, where he had lodg'd his Cannon and Foot Soldiers; &s;o that the E|nemy willing to drive him thence, &s;ent out a Party to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Tulm,</HI> which would have made his Bridge u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e that after they had rendred them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Town, they would have put therein a Garri&s;on, which would have &s;o &s;traitly pre&s;&s;ed our men, that they could not extend them&s;elves beyond
<PB N="79" REF="44"> the <HI>Danube,</HI> as they did be|fore.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ha|ving notice of this de&s;ign, &s;ent word to the Governor of <HI>Tulm</HI> to beware of &s;urprizes. In the mean while to prevent the Enemies return without fighting, he &s;ent out a Party of his men, almo&s;t as numerous as that of the Enemy, and be|ing both met, they &s;o roughly encountered, that there re|main'd of both &s;ides a great number dead in the field. Yet the advantage lay on the Chri&s;tians &s;ide, who put the <HI>Turks</HI> to flight. But they not daring to pur&s;ue 'em too far, for fear of falling into &s;ome ambu&s;h, were oblig'd to re&s;t contented with what they had already perform'd.</P>
<PB N="80" REF="45">
<P>This happy &s;ucce&s;s was &s;econded by &s;everal others. For two or three Parties of our men, having met with &s;everal Troops of the Enemy, kill'd a great number of 'em, and made the re&s;t Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>But this was not &s;ufficient, for without a &s;peedy &s;uccor, <HI>Vienna</HI> was in great danger, Envoys were therefore di&s;|patcht into all Courts, to know what withheld 'em from &s;ending that a&s;&s;i&s;tance they promis'd, and which the City &s;o much needed.</P>
<P>The Pope joyn'd not only entreaties to tho&s;e of the Em|peror, but al&s;o a great num|ber of Briefs, of which the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> was never &s;paring, and by which he
<PB N="81" REF="45"> granted great indulgences to tho&s;e that &s;uccor'd <HI>Vienna</HI> with Money, and an a&s;&s;urance of going &s;trait to <HI>Paradice,</HI> to &s;uch as dyed in &s;o ju&s;t a quar|rel.</P>
<P>But he being &s;en&s;ible that all this would not &s;ignifie much, if he added not there|unto effective a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he therefore &s;ent good &s;ums of Money to the Emperor, part of which came from his own Coffers, and the re&s;t from the Cardinals, who did this not &s;o much out of devotion, as to a&s;&s;ure their own Fortunes, which would have been &s;ha|ken, had <HI>Vienna</HI> fell under the <HI>Ottoman</HI> power. The Pope likewi&s;e &s;ent <HI>Ranucci</HI> into <HI>France</HI> in quality of his <HI>Nuncio,</HI> to move that King

<P>But the King being not over joyful at the news of his com|ing, &s;ent an expre&s;s to <HI>Ra|nucci</HI> not to pa&s;s beyond <HI>Or|leans;</HI> under pretence that he was &s;etting out him&s;elf for the Frontiers; for what I re|late happen'd about the month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the Dy|&s;entery in&s;tead of abating in the City, every moment en|creas'd, &s;o that near an hun|dred per&s;ons dyed every day, as well Citizens as Soldiers. As to <HI>Starenberg,</HI> if the good

<P>Yet things were &s;till in a very bad ca&s;e, how&s;oever we con&s;ider 'em.

<PB N="84" REF="47"> be no &s;urety to the King|dom, in making its Forces march out, whil&s;t there were &s;uch dangerous enemies at the Gate, and &s;uch as were glad of, and lay ready for &s;uch an opportunity.</P>
<P>Yet receiving news continu|ally from that King of his rea|dine&s;s to march, the&s;e a&s;&s;u|rances balanced the contrary reports, which <HI>Starenberg</HI> took care to conceal from his Gar|ri&s;on; for 'twas to be fear'd le&s;t this ill news &s;hould quite ema&s;culate the Soldiers Cou|rage, who appear'd already but too faint, by &s;o many un|happy events, and &s;uch a dan|gerous di&s;temper wherewith they were afflicted.</P>
<P>But that which contributed to render this malady more in|curable,
<PB N="85" REF="47"> was the Airs being &s;o infected by the &s;tench of the dead Bodies which lay un|buried, that it could not be more dangerous in a time of Plague. The cau&s;e of this &s;tench was that <HI>Starenberg</HI> would not yield to any terms of a Truce propos'd by the Vi&s;ier, to take away tho&s;e of his party, who had been kild in &s;o many &s;everal skirmi&s;hes, hoping that be&s;ides the di&s;plea|&s;ure he would receive there|by, this would be a &s;pectacle to damp the Courage of the Soldiers, when in march|ing up to the Charge, they &s;hould &s;ee before their Eyes the fortune of their Compani|ons, which would be a pre|&s;age to them of the like.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="48">
<P>How&s;oever whether 'twas this infection or &s;omething el&s;e, which brought this grievous &s;ickne&s;s into the Town, they were &s;o greatly incommodated by it, that they would willing|ly have been deliver'd from of it at the co&s;t of a greater danger from the enemy. Yet did this di&s;temper rage as well in the Camp of the <HI>Turks,</HI> of which there dyed every day near 300, but which was &s;carce perceva|ble, becau&s;e they continually receiv'd fre&s;h &s;upplies, which made up their lo&s;&s;es. But the&s;e being people never train'd up in War, they &s;eem'd to come there only to fill up a number, and not to encrea&s;e the forces of their party, and being not accu&s;tom'd to undergo the fa|tigues of War, the greate&s;t part
<PB N="87" REF="48"> of 'em fell &s;ick at the end of two days, and rather encreas'd the confu&s;ion than confidence of the Army.</P>
<P><HI>Starenberg</HI> who had advice of what&s;oever happen'd in their Camp, took thence occa&s;ion to excite his people to patience, to whom he declar'd by a kind of prediction, that the coming of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> would per|fect the ruine of the Infidels, and prove the deliverance of the City. And indeed 'twas time for him to come, now or never. For the <HI>Turks</HI> be|ing advertiz'd that he was upon his march, u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to become ma&s;ters of the Town; they had gain'd a Ba&s;tion, in taking of which, they &s;urpa&s;s'd them&s;elves, if one may &s;o &s;ay.
<PB N="89" REF="49"> For although the Chri&s;tians had made a marvellous re&s;i|&s;tance, and &s;uch as might be expected from per&s;ons en&s;pi|red by a noble de&s;pair; all this had hitherto &s;erved only to &s;et a greater lu&s;ter on the valour of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;tion being taken, they attackt the <HI>Ravelin</HI> before mentioned, at the taking of which continuing to Te&s;tify their Courage, they forced all within to leave it to 'em. But a Mine which the Chri&s;tians had made, being at the &s;ame time blown up, they found in another kind of death, that death which they de&s;pi&s;ed un|der a different figure.</P>
<P>They attempted afterwards a de&s;cent into the ditch, &s;et up their gabions and gallery,
<PB N="88" REF="49"> and thundring at the City more than ever with their Cannon, they prepared them|&s;elves to carry it by a gene|ral a&s;&s;ault, before the King of <HI>Poland</HI> could arrive. The day was &s;et for &s;o great a de|&s;ign, being the 29th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> a day &s;acred among&s;t them, and which they Solemnized with a great deal of Super&s;ti|tion.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> care&s;&s;ed the Officers to en|courage them the more, telling 'em the day was come to put an end to their Labors, he ex|horted them not only to do their duty, but every one in particular to incourage his Souldiers. The&s;e Officers in complyance with the command of the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> called together
<PB N="90" REF="50"> their Regiments, under pre|tence of viewing their Arms. And taking thence occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the enterprize, which the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> had formed, told them 'twas their fault the whole War was not ended in one day. That if they took <HI>Vienna,</HI> not only all the Chri|&s;tian Towns, which were in <HI>Hungary,</HI> would &s;urrender of them&s;elves, without &s;triking a &s;troke, but a way thorow all <HI>Germany</HI> would be laid open, where there was no &s;trong City, a good and plentiful Country, and wherein every one would find a recompence of his labour. As they held with 'em this di&s;cour&s;e, the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> who was come out of his Tent, to Authorize by his pre&s;ence the words of
<PB N="91" REF="50"> his Commanders, appeared from one end of the line to the other, where in pa&s;&s;ing, he &s;miled on every one, to &s;hew his approbation of what the Captains had told 'em: then he begins to order all things nece&s;&s;ary for the attack. So that <HI>Staremberg</HI> fearing greatly that day, was as careful on his &s;ide that every one &s;hould prepare him&s;elf to do his be&s;t, in &s;uch an urgent Occa&s;ion. In the mean time he burnt the Gallery which the Enemies had made in the ditch, and having thrown &s;everal Artificial fires on the Wood which they heap|ed therein, he &s;o happily &s;et it on fire, that the <HI>Turks</HI> who ran thither with all their en|deavours, could not put it out. The fire which they of the
<PB N="92" REF="51"> Town made was &s;o great in this rencounter, that the like was never &s;een, and as the <HI>Turks</HI> were bu&s;ied in quench|ing the fire in the Faggots, there were &s;everal of 'em kil'd, and many wounded.</P>
<P>This happy &s;ucce&s;s rais'd up the Chri&s;tians courage, but did not abate that of the In|fidels, who preparing them|&s;elves, as by a prelude for a general a&s;&s;ault, came to make &s;ome e&s;&s;ays of their forces, pretending &s;ometimes to re|build their Gallery, other|whiles to carry away the Town. And although they did not u&s;e all their &s;trength, yet did they &s;o harra&s;s the Gar|ri&s;on, which every day grew weaker, that the Souldiers were &s;carce able to &s;tand on their Leggs.</P>

<P>The Grand <HI>Signor</HI> appre|hending, le&s;t the Chri&s;tians &s;hould joyn together for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Emperour, had thereupon amu&s;ed all a|long this Mini&s;ter with &s;ome propo&s;itions of peace. But <HI>Caprara</HI> perceiving 'twas a folly to expect it, &s;eeing he

<P>The Count &s;eeing his men ready to faint under the num|ber of the Enemy, was well enough plea&s;ed at this Offer.

<P>At this news he cau&s;ed the wounded and &s;ick to be car|ried out of the Camp, and having added thereunto new fortifications, he bethought of reducing the Town, before the <HI>Poles</HI> came to attack him, which could not be yet, their Army being tired by a long march, and needed re&s;t.</P>
<P>Several other Princes had joyn'd in per&s;on with their Troops the Army of the Em|peror, as the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Saxony.</HI> Be|&s;ides there came from all parts of Chri&s;tendom, <HI>France</HI> ex|cepted, a great number of Lords and Per&s;ons of Quality to the Emperors Army.

<P>As for the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Bran|denbeurg,</HI> he had for &s;ome time flattered the Emperour with &s;ending him a con&s;iderable &s;up|ply, but being urg'd to per|form what he had promis'd, and hindred by the Alliance of

But what the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Branden|burg</HI> did, being only for a fair pretence to di&s;engage him&s;elf, he thereupon adds another de|mand, which he knew the Emperor would never grant him.

And moreover that the greate&s;t part of their men had never &s;een any thing more of War, than what this &s;iege had &s;hew'd 'em, how then could they re&s;i&s;t an Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of the flower of Chri&s;tendom, and wherein moreover there were &s;uch a great number of Princes and per&s;ons of e&s;teem, who came there to Conquer or to Dye.

<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier an&s;wer'd to this, that the reputation of the <HI>Sultan</HI> would rather be lo&s;t, if after their remaining &s;o long before a Town, where they had con&s;um'd &s;o much Money, they &s;hould be &s;o ba&s;e as to retire before they had &s;truck a &s;troak.

<PB N="114" REF="62"> The next morning he took a review of his Army, which con&s;i&s;ted &s;till of an Hundred and Ten Thou&s;and fighting men, and re&s;olving to call to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Troops which he had left about <HI>Raab,</HI> and other places of <HI>Hungary,</HI> he &s;ent others in their places, in whom he put not &s;uch con|fidence.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide which the Chri|&s;tians had re&s;olv'd to attack his lines, there &s;tood a Wood, through which they mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily pa&s;s to come at him. The Chri&s;tians at the begining of the Campagn took care to make a commodious pa&s;&s;age. But the Grand Vi&s;ier believ'd he might annoy 'em, if he po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of it, he there|upon timely &s;ent five or &s;ix
<PB N="115" REF="62"> Battalions, who had fell'd &s;e|veral Trees, with which they retrenched them&s;elves. On the other hand the Grand Vi&s;ier, having left 20 Thou|&s;and men for the Guard of his Camp and Trench, marcht out of his Trenches with his Hor&s;e and Foot, whereof he form'd three lines, without reckoning the Body he had re&s;erv'd, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf of a little hill, which might be advantagious during the fight, he cau&s;ed his Can|non to be brought thither, charging tho&s;e who were pla|ced there above all things to abide firm.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Chri&s;tian Army, the Com|manders of which had im|plor'd the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="116" REF="63"> by publick and private Pray|ers, marched with great con|fidence of Victory, having at its head a Prince of &s;o great reputation, and who had al|ready beaten the <HI>Turks</HI> in &s;e|veral other occa&s;ions. But as this Circum&s;tance rais'd their Courage, &s;o did it aba&s;e that of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who fear'd more the <HI>Poles</HI> than any Na|tion; &s;o that they had rather it had been the Emperor at the head of his Forces, than to have there a King, who&s;e Fortune and Valour they great|ly dreaded. But be&s;ides that the Emperor would not &s;o greatly expo&s;e him&s;elf, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> came not &s;o far to obey another, and the Emperor on his &s;ide would pretend to Command him,
<PB N="117" REF="63"> and therefore t'avoid all di&s;|putes he remain'd at <HI>Lintz,</HI> ordering Prayers to be &s;aid in all the Churches, which were never empty of people, who &s;ought of God with the greate&s;t fervor, to favour the Chri&s;tian Army.</P>
<P>The Army being arriv'd at the Wood, the fight began, and was at fir&s;t ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">inately e|nough maintain'd by both Parties. But the Chri&s;tians who &s;aw that if they behav'd not them&s;elves fiercely in this occa&s;ion, the Grand Vi&s;ier might refre&s;h his Troops which would give them far more trouble, leapt over the re|trenchments of the Enemy, and having driven them from the Wood, kill'd as many of 'em as were not quick enough
<PB N="118" REF="64"> to &s;ave them&s;elves. The Wood being wholly clear'd, the Avantguard of the Army drew up it &s;elf at the head of the Wood, to &s;ave the arrear|guard, fearing le&s;t marching farther, without being in a condition to fight, the Grand Vi&s;ier &s;hould march up towards them, and make advantage of the ill condition wherein he might find them. But he was unwilling to depart &s;o far from <HI>Vienna,</HI> fearing le&s;t while he was on the other &s;ide, the Chri&s;tians would let out the <HI>Danube</HI> over one part of his Army, and attack tho&s;e he had left for the keeping the lines, who would be too much put to it to re&s;i&s;t at the &s;ame time the&s;e new Enemies, and the Garri&s;on likewi&s;e,
<PB N="119" REF="64"> who would not fail to &s;ally out.</P>
<P>And therefore he every mo|ment &s;ent out Parties, to &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> for he was in greater fear of what might be done on that &s;ide, than on the other, al|tho he was adverti&s;ed every moment that the Chri&s;tians march'd again&s;t him, &amp; &s;hould have 'em upon his skirts with|in an hour or two at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>And indeed 'twas nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e &s;uccors &s;hould be &s;o near. For altho the <HI>Turks</HI> were not as yet in the Town, yet they were at lea&s;t under it by means of their mines, which was the rea&s;on why <HI>Starenberg</HI> caus'd a Lanthorn to be put on the high Tower of S. <HI>Stephen,</HI> which was the &s;ign, agreed upon by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and he,
<PB N="120" REF="65"> when he &s;hould find him&s;elf in a great &s;trait. His Miners al&s;o were &s;o heartle&s;s, that he had all the difficulty in the World to make 'em work, be|&s;ides the Garri&s;on were &s;o dampt by their ince&s;&s;ant labors and toils, and which is wor&s;e reduced to 5 thou&s;and 5 hun|dred men, of 16 thou&s;and that they were in the beginning of the Siege. For if they lo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and by the hand of the Enemy, &s;ickne&s;s had carried away few le&s;s, &s;o that dying as they did in heaps, they were not burried one by one, but thrown ten or twelve together in an hole.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that had e&s;caped &s;o great danger, and who in ex|pectation of the &s;ame fortune, &s;uffered them&s;elves almo&s;t to
<PB N="121" REF="65"> langui&s;h away, being informed that the &s;uccors, with which they had been &s;o often vainly flattered were near, and on this &s;ide the Wood, where they were &s;een already to appear, took their Arms with &s;uch courage, that a man would have thought 'em other men, than tho&s;e one might have &s;een the other moment. They went all on the Rampart, without expecting any other command, than that which their courage in&s;pired, and it much availd <HI>Staremberg,</HI> that they were in|livened by this new hope, for tho&s;e whom the Grand Vi&s;ier left to guard the Camp, and ordered to go up to the a&s;&s;ault, as &s;oon as ever they &s;aw him March towards the Enemy, ac|quitted them&s;elves with &s;o
<PB N="122" REF="66"> great Re&s;olution and con&s;tancy that they never had before done the like. In the mean time the be&s;ieged, who con&s;idered if they repelled this la&s;t effort, they &s;hould be delivered from the mi&s;ery which had &s;o long af|flicted them, fought with no le&s;s courage; &s;o that never was an hotter di&s;pute on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this happened, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was ingaged with the Grand Vi&s;ier, who had march'd up to him, with more courage than prudence. For without con&s;idering he left the Po&s;t, where he had lodged his Cannon, and whence he might greatly mole&s;t the Chri&s;tians, he began the charge, whereas he &s;hould have expected the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to come and charge him. But whether he
<PB N="123" REF="66"> believed there was any advan|tage to him that gave the fir&s;t on&s;et, or would thereby ani|mate his men, of who&s;e cou|rage he doubted, he neglected to u&s;e the&s;e precautions, of which he pre&s;ently repented. For his Troops giving back, after the fir&s;t charge, the Chri&s;t|ians, &s;o boldly pur&s;ued them, that tho&s;e that had the care of the Cannon dur&s;t not fire, le&s;t it &s;hould prove as hurtful to their own men as ours.</P>
<P><HI>Staremberg</HI> being advertized by per&s;ons whom he had pla|ced in the highe&s;t parts of the Town, that the beginning of the combate was as favorable to the Chri&s;tians as could be de&s;ired, made at the &s;ame time a Sally out of the Garri&s;on, who had already drove the
<PB N="124" REF="67"> <HI>Turks</HI> from off the Rampart. And &s;everal Citizens being mixt with the Soldiers, to &s;hare with 'em in the Honour, they all fiercely attackt the Enemy, who thought already of pack|ing up their baggage, from the advice which they had of the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> that all things went ill on his part, and that they ought to think of a re|treat. Then every one with|out regretting what he had left in the Tent, minded only to &s;ave him&s;elf, when <HI>Staremberg</HI> at the head of his men charg'd them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they threw them&s;elves down one upon another for ha&s;te, who &s;hould fir&s;t get away. And the lines of circumvallation hindring 'em from pa&s;&s;ing &s;o &s;oon as they de&s;ired, they en|deavor'd
<PB N="125" REF="67"> to fill them up with their Muskets, which at that moment &s;erved for Pick|axes and Shovels, others with their hands; every one u&s;ing more diligence to Ruin the&s;e lines than they had done to put 'em in the condition they were in. <HI>Staremberg</HI> &s;eeing the di&s;|order wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> were, was ravi&s;ht at &s;o happy an oc|ca&s;ion. But his prudence, hin|dring him from going far from the Town, he contented him|&s;elf with &s;ending &s;ome Hor&s;e after the hindermo&s;t, and &s;taid him&s;elf in the mean time near the Walls, where he cau&s;ed the Enemies works to be demoli&s;h|ed, le&s;t things &s;hould change its face.</P>
<P>In the mean time the&s;e fu|gitives encrea&s;ed the fear in the
<PB N="126" REF="68"> <HI>Vi&s;iers</HI> Army, which was al|ready but two great; for the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had defeated his left Wing, who&s;e Hor&s;e left the foot at the di&s;cretion of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who had fallen upon 'em and put 'em to the Sword; as to the right Wing, it made a little more re&s;i&s;tance. But the Grand Vi&s;ier con&s;idering that in the condition wherein the fight was, it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tabli&s;h it, &amp; that moreover the Trench was quitted, with all the works which had co&s;t him &s;o much blood, he re&s;olv'd to &s;pare that which remain'd; and to leave rather his Camp, and his Tents which were &s;till &s;tanding, than to be the cau&s;e of &s;hedding more by a fruit|le&s;s ob&s;tinacy. In this de&s;ign he cau&s;ed the Retreat to be
<PB N="127" REF="68"> &s;ounded, but the foot being not able to follow the Hor&s;e, which rather fled than held on an orderly <HI>March,</HI> &s;everal of 'em were cut in pieces, and there were not a 4th part of 'em &s;aved.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> having made a Detachment, to put in|to the Town, and given thanks to God for his Victory, in the very Field where he gained it, gave &s;trict command, under grievous penalties, that no one &s;hould leave his rank to plun|der. The Dukes of <HI>Bavaria, Saxony,</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who had fought likewi&s;e with a great deal of courage, did as much on their &s;ide, and the keeping of the <HI>Turks</HI> Camp was con|&s;ign'd to three thou&s;and men, whil&s;t a Council of War was
<PB N="128" REF="69"> call'd to know whether the Enemy, &s;hould be pur&s;ued, or they re&s;t contented with the advantage already obtained. The advices were different, thereupon the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with all tho&s;e that were in the Em|perors intere&s;ts, were for pur|&s;uing their Victory, but the Dukes of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who came only to &s;uccour <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> would not any more hazard their Troops. E&s;peci|ally the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who complained, that by rea&s;on of his Religion, they had been made to &s;uffer enough all ready. In effect the be&s;t quarters were not his, and he had heard that they &s;u&s;pected le&s;t his Troops having their Winter quarters in <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;hould hold intel|ligence
<PB N="129" REF="69"> with <HI>Teckely.</HI> This Prince &s;eeing then, that after he had traver&s;t a great Coun|try, hazarded his reputation, and even his life, and left his E&s;tates, to &s;uccour tho&s;e of another, he was &s;o ill recom|pen&s;ed, re&s;olved upon return|ing home, where he arrived more laden with glory than &s;poil; for the confederates &s;ee|ing he for&s;ook the common cau&s;e notwith&s;tanding their opinion, gave him what part they plea&s;ed; which again doub|led his di&s;content.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> had better u&s;age, becau&s;e perhaps the Emperor apprehended, le&s;t he in the differ|ences he had with <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould take part again&s;t him being moreover &s;ol|licited to it by &s;everal advantageous offers, be&s;ides his Aliance with it. How&s;oever all the&s;e Princes being not agreed, they made, as we &s;ay,
<PB N="130" REF="70" MS="y"> a Golden bridge, for the Enemy to pa&s;s over, who retired on the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">le of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> where they expected 3 days the wracks of their Army. In the mean while the Grand Vi&s;ier was not without inquietude, how the grand <HI>Seignor</HI> would receive the news of his defeat, and to ca&s;t all the fault on others, he wrote a Letter again&s;t tho&s;e that had the chief com|mand under him. But we have not heard what the Grand <HI>Seignor</HI> has re&s;olved thereupon, no more than what the King of <HI>Poland</HI> has done, reports concerning whom are &s;o various, that ther's as yet no cer|tianty of 'em. Yet tis not to be doubted being &s;o great a Captain as he is, but he will make the be&s;t ad|vantage of his Victory, which all Chri&s;tians ought to de&s;ire.</P>
