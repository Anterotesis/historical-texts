<P><HI>AFter that</HI> John <HI>was put in pri&s;on, Je&s;us came into</HI> Galilee <HI>preaching the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom of God, and &s;aying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand, repent ye, and believe the Go&s;pel,</HI> Mark. 1.</P>
<P><HI>From that time Je&s;us began to preach, and to &s;ay, Repent; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Je&s;us walking by the Sea of</HI> Galilee <HI>&s;aw two Brethren,</HI> Simon <HI>called</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> Andrew <HI>his Brother ca&s;ting a Net into the Sea (for they were Fi&s;hers.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, Follow me, and I will make you Fi&s;hers of men, and they &s;traitway left their Nets and followed him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Je&s;us going on from thence he &s;aw two Brethren,</HI> James <HI>the Son of</HI> Zebedee <HI>and</HI> John <HI>his Brother in a Ship with</HI> Zebedee <HI>their Father mending their Nets, and he called them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And immediately they left the Ship and their Father, and followed Je|&s;us,</HI> Mat. 4.17.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Mark. 1.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</P>
<P>Now here all ye Sea-men and Fi&s;her-men, and all people may &s;ee, the&s;e four Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t their Call, and what trades they were of, Fi&s;her-men and Sea-men, the&s;e and &s;uch were more like to follow Je&s;us then and now, then the High-Prie&s;ts that had the Tythes, and &s;uch as have great Benefices.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>But Chri&s;t is the &s;ame to day, as he was ye&s;terday, and &s;o for ever; for it was not many mighty and rich, but the poor that received the Go&s;pel:</P>
<P><HI>And when Je&s;us was entered into a Ship, his Di&s;ciples followed him, and behold! there aro&s;e a great Tempe&s;t in the Sea, in&s;omuch that the Ship was covered with the Waves, but Je&s;us was a&s;leep.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And his Di&s;ciples came to him and awoke him, &s;aying, Lord &s;ave us, we peri&s;h.</HI> Mark, in the time of a Storm the&s;e Fi&s;her-men came to Chri&s;t, and &s;o &s;hould all Sea-men do now. <HI>And he &s;aid to them, why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith? Then he aro&s;e and rebuked the Winds, and Sea, and there was a great Calm.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the men marvelled &s;aying, what manner of man is this, that even the Winds and the Sea obey him?</HI></P>
<P>Now all ye Sea-men and Fi&s;her-men, let your Eyes be to Chri&s;t, and your Faith in him that hath all Power in Heaven and in Earth given to him; and can &s;till the Storms and Tempe&s;ts and Waves of the Sea, and make it Calm.</P>
<P>And &s;o Chri&s;t it is that &s;aves you from peri&s;hing outwardly, and eternally, as you may &s;ee, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. and <HI>Mark</HI> 4.36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. and <HI>Luke</HI> 8.22, 23, 24, 25.</P>
<P>For both the Winds and the Sea do obey Chri&s;t, by whom they were made; therefore fear God, and let your faith &s;tand in him, who is the author and fini&s;her of it.</P>
<P><HI>And Je&s;us began to teach by the Sea Side, and there was gathered unto him a great Multitude, &s;o that he entered into a Ship and &s;ate in the Sea</HI> (to wit, in the <HI>Ship,) and the whole Multitude was by the Sea on the Land,</HI> as you may &s;ee, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. <HI>Mark.</HI> 4.1. <HI>and he taught them many things by Parables,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now would not many &s;ay, that it was not a con&s;ecrated place to teach the Word of God in; but I mu&s;t tell you, Chri&s;t con&s;ecrates and makes all things and places holy.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Peter</HI> who was a Fi&s;her-man, Chri&s;t &s;aid unto him and the re&s;t of his company of Fi&s;her-men, that he would make them fi&s;hers of men, and bid them follow him, which they did.</P>
<P>And you may &s;ee in <HI>Acts</HI> 2. how <HI>Peter</HI> the Fi&s;her-man by one Ser|mon that he preached converted Three Thou&s;and Souls, as you may &s;ee from the 14th ver&s;e to the 41&s;t the Beginning and End of his Ser|mon.</P>
<P>And now all ye Sea men and Fi&s;her-men con&s;ider this Call of Chri&s;t, who is the &s;ame to day as ye&s;terday, and &s;o for ever to you, if you
<PB N="5" REF="3">will hear hear his voice; for he &s;tands at the door of your hearts and knocks, and if any will hear my voice, faith Chri&s;t, and open his Door (to wit, of his Heart) by joyning to his Grace, Light, Power and Spirit, he will come in and &s;up with you, and ye with him, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21. And &s;o the Sheep of Chri&s;t hear his voice and fol|low him, <HI>John</HI> 10. for <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Fi&s;her-man</HI> &s;aid to the <HI>Jews,</HI> how in the la&s;t dayes <HI>God would pour out his Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and your Sons and Daughters &s;hall prophe&s;ie, and your young men &s;hall &s;ee vi&s;ions, and your old men &s;hall dream dreams; and on my Servants, and on my Hand maids I will pour out in tho&s;e dayes of my Spirit, and they &s;hall prophe&s;ie &s;aith the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now if God hath poured out of his Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and you grieve it, and quench it, and vex it, then how can you prophe|&s;ie, or have any of the&s;e &s;piritual Dreams, or vi&s;ions, or believe or receive this fi&s;her-mans Sermon, who was a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>And again in <HI>Mat.</HI> 14.24. &amp;c. <HI>And Je&s;us con&s;trained his Di&s;ciples to go into a Ship, and to go before him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But the Ship was now in the mid&s;t of the Sea to&s;&s;ed with Waves; for the Wind was contrary. And in the forth Watch of the Night Je&s;us went unto them walking on the Sea; and when the Di&s;ciples &s;aw him walk on the Sea they were troubled, &s;ay|ing, it is a Spirit, and they cryed out for Fear, but Je&s;us &s;pake unto them, &s;aying, Be of good cheer, it is I, be not afraid: And</HI> Peter <HI>an&s;wered him and &s;ald; Lord, if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the Water, and he &s;aid, Come; and when</HI> Peter <HI>was come down out of the Ship, he walked on the Water to go to Je&s;us: But when he &s;aw the Wind boy&s;terous he was afraid; and beginning to &s;ink he cryed &s;aying, Lord, &s;ave me: And immediately Je&s;us &s;tretched forth his Hand and caught him, and &s;aid unto him, O thou little Faith, wherefore did&s;t thou doubt? And when they were come into the &s;hip, the Wind cea&s;ed: Then they that were in the &s;hip wor&s;hipped him &s;aying, Of a Truth thou art the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>And now here all Sea-men and others you may &s;ee it is Chri&s;t that &s;aves, and &s;tills the boy&s;terous Winds and Waves, and makes them to cea&s;e; and therefore ye are not to doubt, but be &s;tedfa&s;t in Faith in all Storms and Tempe&s;ts, and &s;ee and feel Je&s;us to lay hold upon you, as he did upon <HI>Peter,</HI> to &s;ave you from &s;inking in time of &s;torms, who &s;tills the Waves of the Sea, who is the &s;ame to day, as he was ye&s;terday, and &s;o for ever: A Rock of your Age, and a Foundation of your Generation, as he was of former Ages, as you may &s;ee <HI>Mat.</HI> 14. from ver&s;e 22. to ver&s;e 33. and <HI>John.</HI> 6.17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>And again in <HI>Mark</HI> 6. from 47. to 51. there you Sea-men may &s;ee, <HI>When Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples entered the Ship, they had forgotten to take Bread, neither had they in the &s;hip with them more then one Loaf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Chri&s;t charged them, &s;aying, Take heed of the Leaven of the</HI> Phari&s;ees, <HI>and of the Leaven of</HI> Herod.</P>
<P><HI>And the Di&s;ciples rea&s;oned among them&s;elves, &s;aying, It is becau&s;e we have no Bread.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when Je&s;us knew it, he &s;aid unto them, Why rea&s;on ye becau&s;e ye have no Bread? Perceive ye not, neither under&s;tand? Have ye your Hearts yet hardned, having Eyes and &s;ee ye not? And having Ears, and hear ye not?</HI></P>
<P><HI>For do you not remember, when I broke the five Loaves among five Thou|&s;and, how many Baskets full of Fragments took ye up? And they &s;aid, Twelve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when the &s;even</HI> (to wit, Loaves) <HI>among four Thou&s;and how ma|ny Baskets full of Fragments took ye up? and they &s;aid, Seven. And Je|&s;us &s;aid unto his Di&s;ciples, How is it that ye do not under&s;tand?</HI></P>
<P>Now con&s;ider ye Seamen and Fi&s;her-men, and others, that are not Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; for &s;ometimes in your Ships ye have been in &s;car|city of Bread; and now here was Chri&s;t and his Di&s;ciples which had but one Loaf in the Ship, and Chri&s;t convinceth them that they had enough, by his former Miracles.</P>
<P>And therefore they that have Chri&s;t, they have enough, they have him, by whom all things were made, who gives the Encrea&s;e, as you may &s;ee by his Miracles.</P>
<P>And therefore it is good for every one to &s;ee with the pure Eye, and hear with the Pure Ear, &s;o that they may perceive and under&s;tand with the pure Heart what Chri&s;t did and doth do; and what he is able to do in all Nece&s;&s;ities, and to take heed of <HI>Herod</HI>'s and the <HI>Fair-&s;ayers</HI> Leaven, which are not the Doers, but re&s;i&s;t Chri&s;t, who doth not only &s;ay, but doth the Will of his Father, and &s;o do all them that follow him, <HI>Mark.</HI> 8.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</P>
<P><HI>And again Chri&s;t &s;aw two Ships &s;tanding by the Lake, but the Fi&s;her|men were gone out of them, and were wa&s;hing their Nets; And he entered into one of the Ships which was</HI> Simon<HI>'s, and prayed him that he would thru&s;t out a little from the Land, and he &s;ate down and taught the People out of the Ship. Now when he had left &s;peaking, he &s;aid un|to</HI> Simon, <HI>Lanch out into the deep, and let down your Nets for a Draught.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<P><HI>And</HI> Simon <HI>an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him; Ma&s;ter, We have toyled all Night, and have taken nothing; neverthele&s;s at thy word I will let down the Net.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when they had let down the Net they enclo&s;ed a great Multitude of Fi&s;hes, and their Net brake; and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other Ship, that they &s;hould come and help them; and they came and filled both the Ships, &s;o that they beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n to &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">k: And when</HI> Simon Peter <HI>&s;aw it, he fell down at Je&s;us's Knees &s;aying, Depart from me; for I am a &s;inful man, O Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For</HI> Peter <HI>was a&s;toni&s;hed, and all that were with him at the Draught of Fi&s;hes which they had taken; And &s;o was al&s;o</HI> James <HI>and</HI> John <HI>the Son of</HI> Zebedee, <HI>which were Partners with</HI> Simon; <HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto</HI> Simon, <HI>Fear not, from hence forth thou &s;halt catch men. And when they had brought their Ships to Land, they for&s;ook all and followed Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Now here all you Seamen and Fi&s;her-men and others may &s;ee that you may toyl all night to catch outward Fi&s;h with the nets, and take nothing.</P>
<P>And you that call your &s;elves <HI>Fi&s;hers of Men,</HI> you may toyl all the night and catch not a manin God's Net to him, except it be with the Power of Chri&s;t, and know his Voice and obey it and follow him, by whom all things were made.</P>
<P>And &s;o there is not a Sparrow that falls to the Ground, nor a Fi&s;h in a Fi&s;herman's Net, but by the Will of the father.</P>
<P>And therefore all ye Fi&s;her-men and others are to &s;tand in the Will of God, who gives the Encrea&s;e, and fills the Nets and the Ships, and therefore let him have the Prai&s;e and follow him.</P>
<P>And here you may &s;ee the Fi&s;her-men and Seamen <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Andrew,</HI> were Fi&s;hermen and Seamen, and Partners to|gether in Ships, and Preachers of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and catcht a Multitude of outward fi&s;h, and a Multitude of men, which they fi&s;h'd out of the great &s;ea of the World, by the Command and Power of Chri&s;t, <HI>Luke</HI> 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. and <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.18.</P>
<P><HI>And after Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, he &s;hewed him&s;elf again to his Di&s;ciples at the Sea of</HI> Tyberius, <HI>on this wi&s;e he &s;hewed him&s;elf, There were to|gether</HI> Simon Peter, <HI>and</HI> Thomas <HI>called</HI> Didimus, <HI>and</HI> Nathaniel <HI>of</HI> Canaan <HI>in</HI> Galilee, <HI>and the Sons of</HI> Zebedee, <HI>and two other of his Di&s;|ciples.</HI></P>
<P>Simon Peter <HI>&s;aid unto them, I go a fi&s;hing, they &s;ay unto him, We al&s;o go with thee: They went forth and entered into a Ship immediately,
<PB N="8" REF="5">and that Night they caught nothing; but when the Morning was come, Je&s;us &s;tood on the Shore, but the Di&s;ciples knew not that it was Je&s;us: Then Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, Children, have ye any Meat? And they an&s;wered him, No; and he &s;aid unto them, Ca&s;t the Net on the right Side of the Ship and ye &s;hall find, and they ca&s;t therefore; and now they were not able to draw it for the Multitude of Fi&s;hes: Therefore that Di&s;|ple whom Je&s;us loved &s;aid unto</HI> Peter, <HI>It is the Lord. Now when</HI> Simon Peter <HI>heard that it was the Lord, he girt his Fi&s;hers Coat unto him (for he was naked) and did ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Sea, and the other Di&s;ci|ples came in a little Ship) for they were not far from Land, but as it were two hundred Cubits) dragging the Net with Fi&s;hes: A&s;&s;oon then as they were come to the Land, they &s;aw a Fire of Coals there, and Fi&s;h laid thereon, and Bread; And Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, Bring of the Fi&s;h which ye have now caught, and</HI> Simon Peter <HI>went up and drew the Net to the Land full of great Fi&s;hes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, Come and dine,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And Je&s;us then cometh and taketh Bread and giveth them, and Fi&s;h likewi&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And this was now the third time that Je|&s;ns &s;hewed him&s;elf after he was ri&s;en from the dead,</HI> John 21.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>And now all ye Fi&s;hermen and Sea-men and others, con&s;ider what kind of Di&s;ciples and Mini&s;ters the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t cho&s;e; and you may &s;ee that <HI>Peter</HI> and the re&s;t, though they had been Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t Je&s;us for &s;ome Years, and &s;uch that Chri&s;t had &s;ent forth to preach before he was crucified, and after that he was ri&s;en, Chri&s;t appeared the third time unto them; and <HI>Peter</HI> had his Fi&s;hers Coat, and the Di&s;|ciples which were Fi&s;hermen and Seamen they were Partners together in a Ship.</P>
<P>And now, was this a fit Coat think you to preach the Go&s;pel in, and to meet Chri&s;t in, and to dine with him in? I &s;ay, Yes, as good as any of the <HI>Canonnical Garments.</HI></P>
<P>And con&s;ider ye Fi&s;hermen and Seamen and others, how all the&s;e Di&s;ciples had been fi&s;hing all the Night, but had caught nothing.</P>
<P>But when the Morning was come, and they &s;aw Je&s;us, after he was ri&s;en, at his Command they ca&s;t in the Net, and drew it full of fi&s;h to the Shore: So it is by the Will of God and Chri&s;t that every one doth catch, who made all things, and upholds all things by his word and pow|er, and fills all, and knows what all have need of; for as Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>A Sparrow &s;hall not fall to the Ground without the Will of the Father,</HI> &s;o a fi&s;h cannot be caught in the Net without his Will.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>And likewi&s;e you fi&s;hermen and &s;eamen and others may &s;ee, that Je&s;us by whom all things were made, had provided the&s;e fi&s;hermen and &s;eamen, who were his Di&s;ciples, a Fire, and Fi&s;h upon it, and Bread upon the Land, when they had been fi&s;hing in the Sea.</P>
<P>And therefore you may &s;ee, how that Chri&s;t that upholds all things, and hath all power given unto him provides for his Di&s;ciples and Sea|men, and Fi&s;hermen; for he gave them both Fi&s;h in the Sea, and Fi&s;h [and Bread] upon the Land, whom he &s;ent forth, and gave Commi&s;&s;ion to preach, and &s;aid, <HI>Freely ye have received freely give.</HI></P>
<P>So here ye may all &s;ee, how the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t were encou|raged to tru&s;t in him, and that their minds might be carried over all Di&s;tru&s;t of carnal things and outward victuals.</P>
<P>And now ye Fi&s;hermen, and Seamen, and all others may &s;ee Chri&s;t's Words fulfilled unto his Di&s;ciples, who &s;aid unto them, <HI>Follow me, and I will make you Fi&s;hers of Men;</HI> for <HI>Peter</HI> at one Draught caught three Thou&s;and in God's Net; and ye may read <HI>Peter</HI>'s two Gene|ral Epi&s;tles which he freely gave forth.</P>
<P>And al&s;o ye may &s;ee <HI>John</HI> the Fi&s;herman a Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, his Evangeli&s;ts, his General Epi&s;tle, and his two Epi&s;tles, and his Re|velations: Come ye Seamen, and Fi&s;hermen, and others, and &s;ee what ye can &s;ay for Chri&s;t, that is the &s;ame to day, as ye&s;terday, and &s;o forever; and come let us &s;ee what Nets ye have, if it be the Pow|er of God, that will pluck them out of the Sea of Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>And if the Seamen had taken <HI>Paul</HI>'s Coun&s;el, when he &s;aid, <HI>Sirs, I perceive that this Voyage will be for Hurt, and much Damage, not only of the Lading and Ship, but al&s;o of our Lives: But neither the</HI> Centurion, <HI>nor the Ma&s;ter believed</HI> Paul's <HI>Words, but his Words came to pa&s;s,</HI> as you may &s;ee in <HI>Acts</HI> 27. But the Lord pre&s;erved <HI>Paul</HI> and their Lives.</P>
<P>And &s;o you may &s;ee it is not the &s;eamans skill, but the Lord's Power, which all are to have faith in, and to obey him, by which they are &s;aved and pre&s;erved.</P>

<P>The Lord he commandeth and rai&s;eth the &s;tormy wind, which li&s;t|eth up the waves thereof; then do men cry unto the Lord in their troubles, and he brings them out of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es: for he maketh a &s;torm and a Calm, &s;o that the waves thereof are &s;till; then are they glad becau&s;e they be quiet, So he brings them unto their de|&s;ired Haven; for God can turn Rivers into a Wilderne&s;s, and the
