<P>THE Surprizing Adventures and Events that daily a&s;&s;ail Mankind, are &s;o Nu|merous and Extraordinary, that no|thing &s;eems more in&s;eparable to our Mortal &s;tate, than con&s;tant and continual Vici&s;&s;itudes, Changes and Altera|tions; But &s;ince we find in Hi&s;tory, that &s;ome more Remarkable Accidents have happened to &s;ome Pla|ces and Per&s;ons than to others, it mu&s;t needs be ve|ry delightful among &s;uch a multitude of In&s;tances, to give an Account of the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Relati|ons I have met with in many credible Writers, and that is the de&s;ign of this &s;mall Tract; wherein I &s;hall not &s;o much regard the Method, Order, or other Cir|cum&s;tances of an exact Hi&s;torian, as in the whole to divert the Reader with what may be both plea&s;ant and profitable, wherein it may be he may more fully inform him&s;elf of &s;everal matters, which he had for|merly heard of, but yet did not &s;o cleerly under&s;tand; This without any further Preface is that which I now aim at, wherein I will impo&s;e nothing upon any mans belief, but leave every one at his full Liberty what de|gree of Faith he will exerci&s;e therein, it being &s;uffi|cient that I have cited my Authors, who are generally &s;uch as have been accounted Men of Veracity and Ho|ne&s;ty

<P N="1">I. Strange were the Adventures of <HI>Chri&s;topher Colum|bus,</HI> who di&s;covered a <HI>New World</HI> in the la&s;t Age, which is now called <HI>America;</HI> He was born at <HI>Nervi</HI> in the Seigniory of <HI>Genoa,</HI> who being a man of excellent A|bilities; and born to undertake great matters, could not per&s;wade him&s;elf, but that, con&s;idering the Mo|tion of the Sun, there mu&s;t needs be another World to which that Glorious Planet did impart both his Life, and Heat, when he went from us; This World he purpo&s;ed to &s;eek after, and in 1486 he di&s;covered his De&s;ign to the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> who rejecting his Propo&s;als, he &s;ent his Brother <HI>Bartholomew</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh of <HI>England,</HI> who in his Voyage hi|ther unhappily fell into the hands of Pyrates, by whom he was long kept Pri&s;oner, but having at la&s;t obtained his Liberty, he repaired to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> where he found &s;uch cheerful entertainment at the hands of that King, that <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus</HI> was &s;ent for to come thither al&s;o; But <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> not know|ing of his Brothers Impri&s;onment, and not hearing from him, conceived the offer of his &s;ervice to have been neglected, and thereupon made his de&s;ires known at the Court of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> where after many de|lays, and &s;ix years attendance upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, he was at la&s;t furni&s;hed with three &s;hips only, and tho&s;e not for Conque&s;t but Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>With this &s;mall &s;trength he &s;ailed on the Ocean &s;ixty dayes, and yet could &s;ee no land, &s;o that the di&s;contented <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to Mutiny, and refu&s;ed to move a foot forward; Ju&s;t at which time it hap|ned that <HI>Columbus</HI> di&s;cerned the Clouds to carry a cleerer colour than they did before, and therefore intreated them to expect only three days longer, in which time, if they &s;aw not land he promi&s;ed to re|turn; Toward the end of the third day, one of the Company de&s;cried Fire, which was an evident token
<PB N="3" REF="4">
that they drew near to &s;ome &s;hore; The Place they di&s;covered was an I&s;land on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Florida</HI> cal|led by <HI>Columbus</HI> St. <HI>Salvador;</HI> Having Landed his Men, he cau&s;ed a Tree to be cut down, and made a Cro&s;s thereof which he &s;et up neer the place where he came on Land, and by that Ceremony took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the <HI>New World</HI> for the Kings of <HI>Spain, Octob.</HI> 11. 1492. Afterwards he di&s;covered and took Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and with much Trea&s;ure and Content returned to <HI>Spain,</HI> and was preferred by the King for this good Service, fir&s;t to be Admiral of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and in conclu&s;ion to the Title of the Duke <HI>De la Vega</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> The next year he was furni&s;hed with 18 Ships for further Di&s;covery; in this &s;econd Voyage he di&s;covered the I&s;lands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and built the Town of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> after called <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> from whence for &s;ome &s;everities u&s;ed again&s;t the mutinous <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he was &s;ent Pri&s;oner to <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> but very honourably entertained, and cleared from all Crimes imputed to him.</P>
<P>In 1497. he began his Third Voyage; in which he di&s;covered the Countries of <HI>Paria</HI> and <HI>Cumana</HI> on the <HI>firm Land,</HI> with the I&s;lands of <HI>Cubagna,</HI> and <HI>Mar|garita,</HI> and many other I&s;lands, Capes and Provinces; In 1500 he began his fourth and la&s;t Voyage, in the cour&s;e whereof coming to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> he was unwor|thily denied entrance into the City of <HI>Domingo,</HI> after which &s;cowring the Sea-Coa&s;ts, he returned back to <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Spain,</HI> where &s;ix years after he died, and was buried Honourably at <HI>Sevil,</HI> where to this day an Epitaph remaineth on his Tomb, far &s;hort of his merit, which is to this purpo&s;e.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="6">
he very much improved his &s;tock, and now re&s;olv|ing to venture all his Credit both in Friends and Mo|ney, he furni&s;hed him&s;elf with eleven Ships, and with 550 Men, &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Spain,</HI> and arrived at the I&s;land of <HI>Santa Cruce,</HI> and &s;ailing up the River <HI>Taba&s;co</HI> &s;acked the Town of <HI>Pontoncon,</HI> the Inhabitants refu|&s;ing to &s;ell him Victuals; After this, by the help of his Hor&s;e and Ordinance, he di&s;comfited forty Thou|&s;and of the naked <HI>Indians,</HI> who were gathered toge|ther to revenge them&s;elves for the plundering their Town; he then received the King thereof in Va&s;&s;al|lage to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Being told that We&s;tward he &s;hould meet with &s;ome Mines of Gold, he turned his Cour&s;e for the Haven of St. <HI>John de &V;lloa,</HI> where landing he was entertained by the Governor of <HI>Montezuma</HI> King of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who under&s;tanding of his coming, and that he was a Servant of &s;o Great an Emperor as <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, he &s;ent him many rich Pre&s;ents both of Gold and Silver; <HI>Cortez</HI> inflamed at the &s;ight thereof, re&s;olved to go unto the place where &s;uch Trea&s;ures were, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Countrey in the Name of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> and building there the Town <HI>De la Crux,</HI> he left 150 of his men therein, and attended with only 400 Foot, 15 Hor&s;emen, and 6 pieces of Ordinance, he pur&s;ued his Enter|prize, and having cunningly gained to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance tho&s;e of <HI>Zempoallan, Tla&s;cala,</HI> who were ill affected to <HI>Montezuma,</HI> he marched on toward <HI>Mexico,</HI> plundring in his way the Town of <HI>Chololla</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Forty Thou&s;and Hou&s;holds; He was kindly received into <HI>Mexico</HI> by the affrighted King, whom he cau&s;ed to ac|knowledge him&s;elf a Va&s;&s;al to <HI>Spain,</HI> and to pre&s;ent him in the name of a Tribute with &s;o much Trea|&s;ure as amounted to an hundred and three&s;core thou|&s;and <HI>Ca&s;tellins</HI> of Gold; A quarrel growing not long after, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were driven out of the Town; But <HI>Cortez</HI> aided with the whole Forces of the <HI>Tla&s;|calans,</HI>

<P>But unable to prevail this way, finding the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> hearts more &s;trong than their Torments, they thereby grew &s;o inraged, that contrary to all Law of Nations, and again&s;t their &s;olemn Vows and Pro|mi&s;es, they condemned the King him&s;elf, and one of the Chiefe&s;t Princes of his Court to the Rack in the &s;ight of each other; The Prince being encompa&s;&s;ed with hot burning Coals, and being overcome with the ex|traordinary Torment, at la&s;t turned his dying Eyes in a mo&s;t lamentable manner toward his Ma&s;ter, as if he begged his Pardon that he could endure the pain no longer; The King fixing his Eyes fiercely upon him, &s;eemed to upbraid him with pu&s;illanimi|ty and want of Courage, and with a &s;tern, and &s;etled voice &s;poke thus to him, <HI>What? Suppo&s;e&s;t thou that I am in a cold Bath? Am I at more ea&s;e than thou art?</HI> Whereat the mi&s;erable Prince immediately fainted under the Torture, and gave up the Gho&s;t. The

King being half ro&s;ted was carried away, not &s;o much for Pity, for what Compa&s;&s;ion could enter in|to &s;uch Barbarous Wretches, who only upon &s;uppo|&s;ing to get &s;ome odd Ve&s;&s;el or piece of Gold, would broyl a Man to death before their Eyes; and not only a Man, but a King, and a King of &s;uch mighty Grandeur and Renown; but becau&s;e his undaunted Con&s;tancy baffled their inhuman Cruelties, they after|ward hanged him for Couragiou&s;ly attemping by Arms to deliver him&s;elf from his long Captivity and mi&s;era|ble &s;ubjection; and thus he ended his wretched life. Wonderful even to Amazement was the Magnificence of the famous Cities of <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> and ad|mirable the Curio&s;ities of this King, who had all the Trees, Fruits, Herbs, Plants according to their Order and full bigne&s;s in the Garden, mo&s;t Artifici|ally framed in Gold; He had likewi&s;e in his Cabinet all the Living Creatures that his Countrey or his Seas produced ca&s;t in Gold, be&s;ides abundance of exqui&s;ite Works in Precious Stones, Feathers, Cot|ton, and Painting.

When it was killed every one in the Army had a &s;ight thereof, and I then remembred the &s;aying of the <HI>Romans, Africa alwayes produces &s;omething new,</HI> for there is every year &s;ome &s;trange Creature or other to be &s;een in tho&s;e remote places; &s;ome make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to watch them when they come into the World, and imploy all their Art to catch them, and &s;hew them for money; In this wild place were &s;eve|ral other &s;orts of Bea&s;ts and Serpents, one of a &s;trange nature &s;eeming like a white Lamb, which fled before us; Our Captain thought it to be &s;o, and that it had &s;traggled, and therefore we had order to per&s;ue it, and coming near, it made more ha&s;t than ordinary to &s;hift among the Trees, but being very weary and over-fat, it could not e&s;cape us, yet ran into one of the Bu&s;hes, where to prevent di&s;covery its white colour was changed in an in&s;tant into that of the Bu&s;h, which alteration gave us much trouble, and we had never found it again if one of the Com|pany had not di&s;charged a Musket, at the noi&s;e where|of it ro&s;e affrighted, and run for its life, we did not think it the &s;ame, yet &s;ome ventured after it, and o|thers &s;tay'd in the place &s;eeking the white bea&s;t.

<P>Having in three days got over the&s;e Mountains and lying down to refre&s;h our &s;elves, in the Morning an Alarum was &s;ounded, at which we all ran to our Arms, and put our &s;elves in Order, expecting the coming of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> but no Enemy appeared, only a Company of Apes per&s;ued by a few Jackalls who made &s;uch a noi&s;e in running about the branches of the Wood near us, yet tho&s;e upon the skirts of the Army thought them to be the Enemy, who had ta|ken the advantage of the place to fall upon us; their needle&s;s fear did as &s;oon appear as the nimble Creatures recovered the tops of the highe&s;t Trees, to who&s;e protection they dur&s;t commit them&s;elves; yet the Alarum continued, and ran as nimbly as the Apes all over the Army, which could not be &s;topt till every one was informed of the true cau&s;e of the Fright.</P>
<P>Soon after we met with the Enemy indeed, and had &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes with them, and at la&s;t utterly defeated them, and brought the whole Countrey under Contribution, and at la&s;t arrived at <HI>Chin&s;an</HI> a large and populous City, where we continued for &s;ome time, and then travelled toward another anci|ent City called <HI>Bedtua,</HI> not much inferior to the for|mer, we pa&s;&s;ed through many Companies of Tents, and the fir&s;t day had a &s;harp Encounter with about a Dozen lu&s;ty Lions who hunting after their Prey, met with death at the end of our Muskets, yet were they not killed without &s;ome damage, one of our men was wounded with one of their Paws, who lept upon him after he had been &s;truck through the Belly, which made us &s;oon di&s;patch the Lyon.

&s;hould I expect that am now going to render an ac|count of my Faith, I do therefore call the Lord to witne&s;s, as I hope to be &s;aved, and as I hope to &s;ee him in his Kingdom, which will be within a quarter of an hour, I never had any Commi&s;&s;ion from the King of <HI>France,</HI> nor any Treaty with the <HI>French</HI> Agent, nor with any other from the <HI>French</HI> King, neither knew I that there was an Agent, nor what he was, till I met him in my Gallery at my lodging, unlookt for; If I &s;peak not true, O Lord let me not come into thy Kingdom; I cannot deny that when I came back from <HI>Guiana,</HI> being come to <HI>Plymouth</HI> I endeavoured to go to <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was, becau&s;e I would fain have made my Peace before I came to <HI>England,</HI> having heard a rumor, that there was no hope of my life upon my return to <HI>London,</HI> I would have e&s;caped for the &s;afe-guard of my life, and not for any ill intent, or con&s;piracy again&s;t the State.</Q></P>

<P>This Revolt of the <HI>Catalonians</HI> was a Pre&s;ident to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who had extreamly &s;uffered under the breach of their Priviledges, for contrary to the &s;econd Article &s;worn to by King <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>That the Vice-Roy or Governour &s;hould be either Son, Brother, &V;n|cle or Nephew to the King of</HI> Spain; The Infanta <HI>Mar|garita di Mantoua</HI> who had no relation at all to the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> was made Governe&s;s, which they might and perhaps would have born, had they not been incen&s;ed by a more feeling injury in 1636, when a Tax of the fifth part of their E&s;tates was impo&s;ed upon all the Subjects of that Kingdom, an intolerable Greivance, and thought &s;o in&s;ufferable by the Sou|thern Parts of the Nation, that they ro&s;e in Arms to oppo&s;e it, and had &s;et the whole Kingdom in a Flame if it had not been quenched by the timely care and Indu&s;try of the Governe&s;s. Yet this &s;mall &s;tir gave an <HI>Item</HI> to the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> of the readine&s;s of the People to Revolt, which made <HI>Olivarez</HI> endeavour by all ways to cut off the means of their being able to do it; and that was to allure thence <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bra|ganza,</HI>

whom the <HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> looked upon as the Per|&s;on who of <HI>Right</HI> ought to be their King, and the on|ly Native of the Kingdom that might re&s;tore again the Line of <HI>Alphon&s;o;</HI> Be&s;ides he was a Prince who for Power, Riches, and Number of Tenants, not on|ly exceeded all the Nobles in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but even of <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf; And indeed the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> was one of the mo&s;t Glorious Subjects in <HI>Europe,</HI> being allied to mo&s;t Kings in <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> which made the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> though they were Competitors for the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Treat this Family with more Hon|our than any other of his Grandees, receiving them with almo&s;t as much re&s;pect as if they were Soveraign Princes, which appeared in King <HI>Philip</HI> 2. who mo&s;t of all de&s;ired to aba&s;e this Family, yet always when the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> came to vi&s;it him, he would meet him in the middle of the Room, and not per|mitting him to ki&s;s his hand, &s;eat him with him&s;elf under the Canopy of E&s;tate.</P>
<P>To draw the Duke therefore out of <HI>Portugal, Oli|varez</HI> fir&s;t politickly offered him the Government of <HI>Millain,</HI> a place of great Tru&s;t and Honour; but he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed it, as not in a Condition at that pre&s;ent to undertake &s;o great a Command, and indeed expre&s;&s;ing an unwillingne&s;s to go out of the Kingdom, which made the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Count more willing to draw him from thence, and to this end it was di&s;cour&s;ed; <HI>That the King him&s;elf was re&s;olved to go in Per&s;on to reduce the revolted</HI> Catalonians, <HI>and that there|fore all the Nobility &s;hould be in readine&s;s in four months time to attend His Maje&s;ty in that Expedition;</HI> But the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> being &s;u&s;picious of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> becau&s;e he knew him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected by them, and likely &s;o to be, whil&s;t the <HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> &s;o much affected him, to a&s;|&s;ure him&s;elf of the ones love, and if po&s;&s;ible to pre|vent the others &s;u&s;pition, retires him&s;elf to his Coun|trey Hou&s;e at <HI>Villa Vicio&s;a,</HI> and there follows his &s;ports of Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not at all regarding matters of State, withal &s;ending an Excu&s;e to Count <HI>Olivarez, That his

<P>In an&s;wer to the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI>'s Letter of Ex|cu&s;e, The Count a&s;&s;ures him, <HI>That His Maje&s;ty was very well &s;atisfied with the rea&s;ons of his not attending him to</HI> Catalonia, <HI>being very &s;en&s;ible of his good inclinations to his &s;ervice That for his own part he was very &s;orry his Affairs were in &s;uch a low Condition, and could not but commi&s;erate his Intere&s;t as his own; That His Maje&s;ty to let him know how great confidence he repo&s;ed in his Fidelity, had appointed him General of the Militia of the Kingdom, and had for his pre&s;ent &s;upply &s;ent him Three&s;core Thou&s;and Crowns, leaving it to his Choice to re&s;ide in what place near</HI> Lisbon <HI>he plea&s;ed.</HI> This &s;trange Confidence repo&s;ed in the Duke by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> much amazed the greate&s;t Politicians, who thought it rea&s;onable that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;hould have permitted the Duke &s;till to have kept retired in the Countrey, rather than to have given him &s;uch a Com|mand, and called him to <HI>Lisbon</HI> into the continual view of the People, who looking on him as the Heir of that Hou&s;e, which had been ever repre&s;ented to have the only Right to the Crown, might ea&s;ily be in|flamed with a de&s;ire to have a King of their own; And the&s;e things the Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> of <HI>Mantoua</HI> was very &s;en|&s;ible of, and therefore continually &s;olicited the King to know his Rea&s;on, or to de&s;ire him to remove tho&s;e apparent opportunities which he had given the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> to effect a Revolt; But &s;he not only re|ceived

intricate and doubtful an&s;wers from the King and <HI>Olivarez;</HI> but had likewi&s;e the former Actions &s;econded with one, which made her think the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had a mind to to&s;s the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> into Duke <HI>Braganza</HI>'s hands whether he would or no; For on a &s;udden without any notice given her, all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on in St. <HI>Johns</HI> Ca&s;tle which com|manded the City of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and indeed upon the &s;trength of which the whole &s;afety and &s;ecurity of the Kingdom depended, were &s;uddenly drawn forth and the Ca&s;tle left to the di&s;po&s;al of the Duke.</P>
<P>But this was the la&s;t Act of Count <HI>Olivarez</HI> confi|dence in the Duke, for by tru&s;ting him &s;o much, he now thought that he could not on the contrary but re|po&s;e confidence in him, and therefore next Summer in 1640. he again by Letters &s;ollicites him to leave <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> and come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him, <HI>That his Ca|tholick Maje&s;ty gave him many thanks, and greatly ap|plauded his Loyalty in the exerci&s;e of the Office of General, and was very &s;en&s;ible of the good effects which his Authori|ty had wrought on the</HI> Portugals; <HI>He next repre&s;ented to him, the pre&s;ent declining condition of the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Monar|chy, not only by rea&s;on of the di&s;orders in</HI> Flanders <HI>and</HI> Italy, <HI>and the preparations of the</HI> Turks, <HI>but more e&s;peci|ally, becau&s;e their mo&s;t Potent Enemies the</HI> French, <HI>were now in A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the revolted</HI> Catalonians <HI>entred</HI> Spain; <HI>That it highly concerned His Catholick Maje&s;ty to drive them out of his Territories, which could not be done with|out a very powerful Force. That he being one of the Prime Grandees of the Kingdom, might by his pre&s;ence in the head of a good number of his Tenants, encourage others to a &s;uit|able A&s;&s;i&s;tance; That to this purpo&s;e His Catholick Maje&s;ty expected him every moment, having de&s;igned for him great Honours, Priviledges and Dignities &s;uitable to his merit.</HI> But as cunning an Angler as <HI>Olivarez</HI> was, yet he fail|ed of his Mark, this bait would not hook in the Fi&s;h; For though the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> was accounted no great Polititian, yet his own &s;afety taught him to know, that all the&s;e great Offices, and fair Promi&s;es, were
<PB N="211" REF="108">
but guilded allurements to draw him to his de&s;tructi|on; Having therefore &s;upplyed the King with a con|&s;iderable number of his Tenants and Friends, he found excu&s;es for his own not going in Per&s;on; And to prevent all &s;u&s;pition, he retired again to his Coun|try-hou&s;e; Thus the&s;e 2 great Per&s;onages endeavour|ed by Craft and Di&s;&s;imulation to &s;upplant each other; only one &s;trove the others de&s;truction, the other only &s;tudied his own &s;afety and pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>During all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, the Vice-Queen <HI>Margari|ta</HI> was very Vigilant in her Government, and fore&s;ee|ing in rea&s;on what might be the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e pro|ceedings, writ very importunately to the King, a&s;&s;u|ring him, that if it were not &s;uddenly prevented, the Kingdom would be infallibly lo&s;t; To which &s;he re|cieved no an&s;wer, only <HI>Olivarez</HI> &s;lighting her Judg|ment as fitter to govern a private Hou&s;e than a King|dom, &s;ent her word, <HI>That if her capacity would not reach to the height and drift of tho&s;e my&s;teries of State, yet that her wi&s;dom would keep her from di&s;covering them;</HI> But without doubt <HI>Olivarez</HI> was inwardly perplexed, to &s;ee all his Plots thus fail, and foul means he dur&s;t not openly attempt, &s;uch was both the Dukes Power, and the great Love the people bore him, he therefore at la&s;t had recour&s;e to treachery, and gives &s;ecret or|der to Don <HI>Lopez de O&s;&s;is,</HI> and Don <HI>Ant.

<P>And now was the time come, wherein according to St. <HI>Bernards</HI> Prophe&s;ie, the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> was to be relea&s;ed from the Tyranny of Strangers, and re&s;tored again to the Government of a Native

<P N="104">104. The remarkable revolutions in the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and the entire Conque&s;t thereof by the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> happened in the &s;ame year 1640; As if &s;ome fa|tal influence had inclined mo&s;t Nations to changes and di&s;tractions at that time. It cannot therefore be unplea&s;ant to give a brief account thereof; The In|habitants of <HI>China</HI> enjoyed all the plea&s;ures of peace under the Government of their la&s;t Emperour, who was the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Monarch that ever ruled tho&s;e va&s;t Territories; when in the year 1640, a year fa|tal to &s;everal States, tho&s;e Clouds began to gather, which &s;hortly after produced &s;uch a &s;torm as ruined the whole Empire; The name of the pre&s;ent Empe|rour was <HI>Zunchin,</HI> a deceitful, and unfortunate name, for in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Language, it &s;ignifies <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> omen, or <HI>Soveraign Dominion,</HI> but how fal&s;e a progno&s;tick
<PB N="223" REF="114">
this was appeared quickly; This Emperor was of a mo&s;t courteous and good di&s;po&s;ition, and certainly his Subjects, who enjoy'd great Plenty, and all the ad|vantages of Peace, lived truly happy under &s;o Excellent a Prince; But it is not &s;ufficient for a Prince to be Good, and to govern mildly and peaceably, unle&s;s he likewi&s;e takes care not to have ill Officers, who make u&s;e of their Credit under him, to gratifie their Private Pa&s;&s;ions and to extend their Ambition beyond all Bounds and Limits; yet &s;ome Authors have branded him for Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and that after a great Famine which happened in the Northern Provinces, occa&s;ioned by an unheard of number of Locu&s;ts, he impo&s;ed up|on his Subjects as high Taxes, as they paid formerly in fruitful flouri&s;hing times, the former Money being all mi&s;pent, and the Souldiers not paid; Whereupon the number of the Mutineers daily increa&s;ed, who enriched them&s;elves by Plunder and Rapine. For as <HI>Semedo</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>China</HI> intimates, <HI>Rebellion is the u&s;ual Effect of Extortion and Tyranny, especially where the Prince would have more from the People than they are able to give, And therefore</HI> Theopompus (&s;aith he) <HI>King of the</HI> Lacede|monians, <HI>when his wife told him, that becau&s;e he had ea&s;ed the People of many Taxes, he would leave his Son a poorer Kingdom, than he received from his Father; an&s;wered, Relinquo &s;ed Diuturnius;</HI> that is, <HI>I &s;hall leave him a more la&s;ting Kingdom,</HI> Happy had it been for <HI>Zunchin</HI> Em|peror of <HI>China</HI> had he been of <HI>Theopompus</HI> his Mind.</P>
<P>But (&s;aith my Author) though I find him charged with Covetou&s;ne&s;s, yet I am not very apt to &s;u&s;pect him &s;o guilty of that Vice, as of another u&s;ually more fatal to Princes, which is a facile Nature, ea&s;ie to be wrought upon by others, and too inclinable to favour and indulge them&s;elves, and not willing to undergo the weight of Affairs; From whence it was, that though under the Reign of his Brother <HI>Thienking,</HI> who pre|ceded him in the Imperial Throne, <HI>Zunchin</HI> &s;o oppo&s;|ed his Darling Favourite the Eunuch <HI>Guei,</HI> and all the Eunuchs his Parti&s;ans, that at la&s;t he prevailed
<PB N="224" REF="115">
with his brother to bani&s;h them all his Court, to the great Satisfaction of the whole Empire, and when his Brother dying without I&s;&s;ue the Imperial Crown fell to him, at his fir&s;t taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, he &s;o per|&s;ecuted the Eunuchs who by abu&s;e of their Authority under his Brother had made them&s;elves abhorred by the whole Nation, that <HI>Guei</HI> in de&s;pair poy&s;oned him|&s;elf; yet at la&s;t this very Emperor &s;uffered him&s;elf, by the crafty in&s;inuation of &s;ome about him, contra|ry to his own Judgment, to be prevailed with to recal tho&s;e in&s;olent Extortioners, and mo&s;t imprudently made his incen&s;ed Enemies, his reconciled Confidents. And intru&s;ts them with the &s;ole Management of all Affairs, who now conceal their Malice again&s;t him, but forgot not to Study revenge; and being backed with his Authority, by their Extortion they grind the face of the People, enrich them&s;elves, render their Ma&s;ter odious to his Subjects, endeavour by all Arts to defraud him, keep back his Souldiers pay and Pro|vi&s;ion, thereby to occa&s;ion Mutinies; hold corre&s;pon|dence with the Rebels, not acquaint him with the dan|ger that Threatned both him and his Empire, and at la&s;t admit the whole Army of the Traytors into the very Walls of the City <HI>Peking,</HI> the &s;ad Con&s;equences whereof we &s;hall find hereafter.</P>

&s;o far as to reach the Emperors Ears; The Mini&s;ters of State, and Officers of the Court &s;topped the Pa&s;&s;age, having already &s;old the Empire and their Ma&s;ter, by abu&s;ing his mild Di&s;po&s;ition; The &s;aying of <HI>Diocle&s;i|an</HI> is but too True, <HI>That though a Prince be Good, Pru|dent, Ob&s;ervant, Careful, and Vigilant, yet he cannot pre|vent Treachery, if tho&s;e who are in imployment under Him, &amp; who ought to &s;erve and advi&s;e him Faithfully, do contrari|wi&s;e combine together to &s;urprize him, and make ill u&s;e of his Authority; Either the Ability and Fidelity of the Coun&s;ellors mu&s;t &s;trike a Terror into Rebels, or they will &s;oon make them|&s;elves a Terror both to the Prince, and His Coun&s;ellors.</HI> The two Cheifs of this Rebellion took &s;uch advantage by this Pernicious Negligence, that tho&s;e Coun&s;els which if at fir&s;t executed would with great facility have put an end to the&s;e Troubles, became now both unfit, and impo&s;&s;ible to be put in Execution; In a &s;hort time they gained them&s;elves the Renown of Great and mo&s;t Va|liant Commanders, and by this advantage they quick|ly had Forces enough, not only to defend them&s;elves, but to inlarge their Conque&s;ts, their Confederates in|crea&s;ing daily &s;o that by force of Arms they made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of Five Provinces.</P>

But mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly when we &s;hall have &s;ubdued the re&s;t, none will be &s;o audacious and ra&s;h to call us Rebels and &V;&s;urpers; Rebels if Victorious cea&s;e to be Rebels, and become the Right and Lawful Lords and Ma&s;ters; What therefore now re|mains, but that I either make my &s;elf the Soveraign Monarch of</HI> China, <HI>or lo&s;e my Life in the&s;e Feilds, and there become a Prey to Birds of the Air, and Bea&s;ts of the Feild; there is nothing in all this spacious Empire can gratifie me, but either a Throne or a Grave, and I will advance my &s;elf to &s;uch a pitch of Grandeur, that if I fall, it &s;hall be with &s;uch a Crack as &s;hall &s;hiver the whole frame of Government, and bury the whole Empire under my Ruins.</HI> Thus <HI>Ly</HI> &s;poke to his Followers, that were intirely devoted to him, who find|ing their Re&s;olution, he &s;peedily entred upon a mo&s;t bold and hazardous De&s;ign, but of high importance for the &s;udden accompli&s;hing his Preten&s;ions, which was to go directly again&s;t the very Per&s;on of the Emp. and with all his Forces to a&s;&s;ault the Imperial Court, and
<PB N="228" REF="117">
Capital City of the Empire, fully determining to &s;trike off the Emperors head, and to place the Crown on his own; By this eminent exploit he knew he &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the Kings Trea&s;ure, which would highly &s;trengthen his Party, and be&s;ides cut off all Power from any of the Royal Family to rai&s;e any Forces, or to head any who &s;hould yet have any &s;parks of Loyalty in their Brea&s;t. To execute this Grand Attempt, he mu&s;t make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Great City of <HI>Pequin,</HI> where all the Court re&s;ided; But he could not hope to do this by open Force, and therefore re&s;olves to do it by Stratagem, and &s;o to &s;urprize the Town, that the Thunderclap &s;hould be felt before the noi&s;e was heard. By this &s;udden &s;urprize, he would not leave the Emp. time to prepare either for his defence or flight; Otherwi&s;e it would have been very difficult for <HI>Ly</HI> with all his Force he could have rai&s;ed, to have &s;o &s;uddenly reduced this Great <HI>City;</HI> For be&s;ide the va&s;t Extent of <HI>Pequin,</HI> it was very well fortified, and in time of Peace was guarded with 80000 of the Emp. be&s;t Souldiers; The Imperial Palace alone is above 2 Miles round, and defended with 2 or 3 Walls, Ditches and Bulwarks, which are all di&s;tinct from each other and very &s;trongly guarded. <HI>Ly</HI> fore&s;aw all the&s;e dif|ficulties, and therefore he had already by Pre&s;ents and fair Promi&s;es bribed &s;everal of the Grandees of the Court and Council, whereby he found it not difficult to engage them in his Intere&s;ts. A &s;trange thing, that when there was not one Per&s;on of the common people either in City or Court who could be drawn into this Trea&s;on, yet &s;everal of the Magi&s;trates and Officers of the Court made them&s;elves a dete&s;table Example, by entring into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the State, and the Per&s;on of their Prince; The chief of the con&s;pirators were the Eunuchs of the Imperial Palace, who were then very potent, and con&s;iderable in the Court, and upon who&s;e Fidelity the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> much pre&s;umed, entru&s;ting them with the Guard of his Per&s;on and the Government of the State.</P>

During the time of this re&s;i&s;tance, the Em|perour con&s;idered how &s;peedily to di&s;po&s;e both of his Royal Family and Per&s;on, which was in the mo&s;t Tragical manner that ever Hi&s;tories related; He had but one only Daughter, very young, which till now had been the hope and de&s;ire of the Empire, his on|ly Son dying before this direful di&s;a&s;ter; The Em|perour cut her Throat with his own hands, and at her own &s;upplication, that &s;he might not &s;ee her Honour and Illu&s;trious Rank become a &s;hameful Prey to a Tyrant and Traytor, who had nothing great and eminent in him, but his Trea&s;on and Rebellion again&s;t his Lawful Soveraign; After this horrid Execution, the Emperour with his hands, yet reeking with the blood of his Daughter, went into the Garden of the Pallace, accompanied with his Lawful Spou&s;e, the Empre&s;s, for whom he had for&s;aken &s;ix other Wives who had each of them the Title of Queen, 30 others who were the mo&s;t illu&s;ttrious Ladies of the Empire, and 3000 others of le&s;&s;er Quality; Some of their faithful &s;ervants under&s;tanding their cruel intentions, filled the Air in proclaiming their griefs, &s;ome cry|ed, <HI>My Lord and my Hu&s;band,</HI> others, <HI>My King and my Master,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>my Father,</HI> every one accent|ing their &s;orrow in a tone &s;uitable to their part in this &s;cene of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The heart of this unfortunate Prince was penetra|ted with &s;o great affliction, that it could admit of no Con&s;olation, and only comforted him&s;elf that he &s;hould pre&s;erve the Honour of his Empre&s;s, being al|together

unconcerned for his other Queens, and nu|merous Wives; Some few Courtiers, who among &s;o many Traytors remained faithful to him, attended with a doleful &s;ilence upon the Emperour and Em|pre&s;s, who could neither &s;peak a word, nor &s;hed a tear, &s;orrow had taken &s;uch entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hearts. <HI>Zunchin</HI> was a young Prince, endowed with all the qualities that might render him amiable to his People; His Royal Spou&s;e the Empre&s;s loved him with &s;o tender an affection, that to te&s;tifie the &s;ince|rity of her Pa&s;&s;ion to him, &s;he re&s;olved to dye either with or before him; The Prince being very pen&s;ive, and &s;ollicitous how to prevent greater di&s;graces, went together with tho&s;e who accompanied him towards a little Grove, at the entrance of which he &s;topped, and then the Empre&s;s gue&s;&s;ing at his de&s;ign, approach|ed to him, and giving him her la&s;t embraces, &s;he part|ed from that per&s;on which was the deare&s;t to her of all things upon Earth, with all the grief and &s;orrow that Humane Nature is capable of, and then &s;he en|tred all alone into the Grove, and with a Cord hang|ed her &s;elf upon one of the Trees; A dreadful &s;pec|tacle which might make even tho&s;e who were more &s;en&s;le&s;s than the Trees, lament &s;o direful a death of &s;o great an Empre&s;s. Pre&s;ently after, the Emperour went and placed him&s;elf near his Wife, whom he &s;aw hanging upon a Tree, having fini&s;hed her Life by a death as violent as that which he had inflicted upon his Daughter; Then poor Prince he asked a lit|tle Wine of one of the Lords which attended him, not that he was a lover of Wine, but on the contra|ry, was the mo&s;t &s;ober, and moderate in his plea|&s;ures of all the Princes which ever governed the Em|pire; And was &s;o cha&s;t toward women that he never frequented his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which made his Subjects call him the <HI>Cha&s;t Prince;</HI> It was not therefore for the love of Wine, but a little to revive and refre&s;h his Spirits; And doubtle&s;s he had need of great courage to put in Execution what he de&s;igned; When the

Wine was pre&s;ented to him he &s;ipped a little of it, and then biting with violence one of his Fingers, and &s;queezing out his blood, he writ therewith the&s;e following words.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Mandorins <HI>(or Eunuchs) are all Villains; they have perfidiou&s;ly betrayed their Prince, they all de&s;erve to be hanged, and it will be a laudable Act of Ju&s;tice, to execute this Sentence upon them; It is fit they &s;hould all &s;uffer death, that thereby they might in&s;truct tho&s;e who &s;ucceed them to &s;erve their Prince more Loyally; As for the People they are not Criminal, and de&s;erve not to be puni&s;hed, and therefore to u&s;e them ill, will be inju&s;tice; I have lo&s;t my Kingdoms which I recieved in inheritance from my Ance&s;tors; In me is fini&s;hed the Royal Line, which &s;o many Kings my Pro|genitors continued down to me, with all the Grandeur, and Fame &s;uitable to their Maje&s;tick Dignity, I will therefore for ever clo&s;e my eyes, that I may not &s;ee this Empire de&s;cen|ded to me, thus ruined and ruled by a Tyrant; I will go and deprive my &s;elf of that Life for which I can never &s;uf|fer my &s;elf to be indebted to the ba&s;e&s;t and vile&s;t of my Sub|jects; I have not the confidence to appear before them, who being born Subjects are become my Enemies and Traytors; It is fit the Prince &s;hould dye, &s;ince his whole State is now expiring; And how can I endure to live, having &s;een the lo&s;s and de&s;truction of that which was dearer to me than Life.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince, after he had thus writ what his ju&s;t grief dictated to him, he untied his Hair, and co|vering his face, pre&s;ently with his own hands he hang|ed him&s;elf upon a Tree, near to that on which the Empre&s;s remained &s;trangled; This was the Tragical <HI>Cata&s;trophe</HI> of this unfortunate Monarch. The Empe|rour of <HI>China</HI> remained thus hanging on a Tree, the Prince who was the Idol of his people, at the very name of whom Millions of men trembled; The So|veraign of above an 100 Millions of Subjects, the Monarch of a Kingdom as &s;pacious as all <HI>Europe;</HI> He who counted his Souldiers by Millions, and his Taxes and Tributes by hundreds of Millions; Finally, the
