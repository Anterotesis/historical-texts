<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Wor&s;hipful GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE immen&s;e Priviledges and Immu|nities, wherewith your pre&s;ent Sove|reign, and indulgent Father, <HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Second, hath inve&s;ted your Company, by that <HI>Octroy</HI> of the Year, <HI>1695,</HI> argues his good Inclinations towards you &s;o far, that whil&s;t he was in the warmest Trenches of <HI>Namure,</HI> (and not &s;ure but that Act might be his la&s;t Legacy) authoriz'd you and your Succe&s;&s;ors to Plant, and maintain Colonies in whatever Part,
<PB REF="3">or Parts of <HI>A&s;ia, Affrica</HI> and <HI>America</HI> you pleas'd, provided the&s;e Places or Territories were not the Propriety of &s;uch <HI>European</HI> Princes or States, as were in Alliance of A|mity with His Maje&s;ty; and freed you for the Space of Twenty One Years, from all Du|ties on the Product of &s;uch Plantations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You were not only impower'd to defend your Colonies and Trade by Force of Arms, but likewi&s;e had His Maje&s;ty's Promi&s;e to in|terpo&s;e the Regal Authority, to do you Right, in ca&s;e you were di&s;turb'd in &s;uch Legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Trade, and that at the pub|lick Charge (to be pre&s;um'd) of the Ancient Kingdom.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty having thus granted you &s;o large and glorious a Patent, no to be para|lell'd by that of any Company or Society in the &V;niver&s;e; much le&s;s by any of his Royal An|ce&s;tors, your Native or &V;nforeign Kings; both the pre&s;ent and after Ages will expect that the &s;ame &s;hould be tran&s;mitted by you, the pre&s;ent Directors, to your Succe&s;&s;ors, with|out any Stain or Blemi&s;h that may incur the Hazard of a Forfeiture: And that by your Management, your Children may reap the Be|nefits of it, with the &s;ame, if not with more Ad|vantages.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>This emboldens the Author (who was the fir&s;t Per&s;on employ'd in your Service for your Foreign Expedition, and the fir&s;t who left it) to lay the following Sheets at your Feet. And he takes upon him to put you in Mind, that if you had not mi&s;apply'd the Money intru&s;ted to your Management (the Want whereof is &s;o much felt at Home by the great Number of needy Per&s;ons, who expected their Dividends before now.) And if you had li&s;ten'd to the whole|&s;ome Advice of Mr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> an eminent and experienc'd Man in <HI>India,</HI> who offer'd him&s;elf for your Pilot, and his Sub&s;tance for your Security, which was more than the Three be&s;t Shares in your Capital Stock; and had not been bewitch'd to the Golden Dreams of <HI>Pa|ter&s;on</HI> the Pedlar, Tub-preacher, and at la&s;t Whim&s;ical Projector; you might e'er now have been po&s;&s;e&s;t of a good Colony in <HI>India,</HI> where no Body could di&s;turb you: And not have run on an Airy Project, which (altho' you &s;hould have met with an Oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Spani|ard)</HI> four times your Capital Stock could not have brought to any rea&s;onable Pitch of An|&s;wering the End. And had you been Ma&s;ters of &s;o much Management and Temper, as to have &s;av'd that Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds, which you &s;quander'd away on tho&s;e Six Hulks you built at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> purely to make a Noi&s;e there of your Proceedings, where|by
<PB REF="4">you thought to decoy the innocent <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, or at lea&s;t their Gelt, into your Net; and had therewith bought a Couple of Second|hand Ships in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and di&s;patch'd them to <HI>India</HI> with a &s;uitable Cargoe, (not of <HI>Scotch</HI> Cloth, Slippers, Periwigs and Bibles) you might have had &s;uch Returns e'er now, as would have buoy'd you up &s;o far above Water, as you needed not proclaim to the &s;mi|ling World &s;o many publick Ropings of the Shares of your Capital Stock.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Sed quos Deus or Jupiter perdere vult eos dementat.</L></Q>
<P>If you were thus per&s;waded to run head|long on a blind Project, at which the Trading Part of the World &s;tand amaz'd; the <HI>India</HI> Companies of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> laugh at in their Sleeve, and the re&s;t of Mankind ad|mire, that People in their right Sen&s;es &s;hould be guilty of: And if the &s;ame &s;hould mi&s;carry by your own ill Management (to &s;ay no wor&s;e on't) 'tis not fair you &s;hould &s;narle at your Neighbours, who have no other hand in your Misfortune, than that they would not be acce&s;&s;ary to any Act, which the World might judge Feloni|ous; and wherein they could not join without ingaging them&s;elves in an unrea&s;onable War,
<PB REF="4">and in the End to a&s;&s;i&s;t you with Weapons, to break their own Heads.</P>
<P><HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Second, who, as you &s;ay, in an untainted Line, is the 112th King that hath wore your Regal Diadem, has wrought and fought &s;ufficiently for the Gift, your Nation prudently thought their Intere&s;t to make him. Or admit it &s;hould be true, that there was no private Intere&s;t con&s;ulted by tho&s;e generous <HI>Do|nators,</HI> yet it is obvious to the World, that by being Subjects of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> you are not only &s;haded from the In&s;ults of all Nations, but by the Authority of your <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sovereign, you are freed from the daily Feuds, and bloody little Wars, which, before the &V;ni|on, for a Tract of Time, not le&s;s than <HI>1900</HI> Years, were continually raging among&s;t your &s;elves; which unnatural Ma&s;&s;acres your Na|tive Princes were &s;o unable to &s;uppre&s;s, that when the contending Clans or Parties were glutted with one anothers Blood, and de&s;ir'd the Benefit of the Princely Mediation; tho&s;e were pleas'd to accept of the Office of &V;m|pires, in Patching up the Feuds, till &s;uch time as the young Fry came of Age, to fight it out. The&s;e Barbarities have been quite turn'd out of Doors &s;ince the &V;nion, and they are now, either almo&s;t or altogether forgot; neither are they to be reviv'd, unle&s;s it be by
<PB REF="5">this &s;o-much-wi&s;h'd-for Separation of Three or Four Months Date. Your People now enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, and Product of the Earth, and Ocean without any interruption; and where|as formerly they liv'd on the Mountains, and under the Shelter of &s;ome &s;trong Rocks or Ca&s;tles, they are now come down to the Plains, and can &s;leep &s;ound in Beds, without the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of Blood and Rapine. And to Crown your Felicity, you have now a free En|joyment of the Go&s;pel, in the Fulne&s;s and Pu|rity thereof, which has ever been reckon'd the chief Care and Ble&s;&s;ing of all Political Bodies. You are at Liberty to &s;ay your Prayers, either in Form, or out of Form, which you plea&s;e, without any Dread of Sophi&s;tical Impo&s;itions by Romi&s;h or Malignant Prie&s;ts. And now you prai&s;e your Maker in &s;tately Churches, whereas, formerly the&s;e gallant Men, your Ance&s;tors, were oblig'd to offer on &s;uch Altars as <HI>Jacob</HI> made, and to whi&s;per their Prayers or Carrols through the Cliffs of the Mountains, or the Chimney of &s;ome Hou&s;e, who&s;e Wall was &s;ome Twelve or Fourteen Foot thick. All the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings you owe to Heaven, and the Briti&s;h Monarchy, whatever &s;ome vitiated and de|prav'd Palates per&s;wade you to the Contrary.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>The mask'd <HI>Champion</HI> of your Company, who&s;e Tongue is much too big for his Mouth, is in Pain becau&s;e he cannot &s;purt out all his Ve|nom at one Bla&s;t. However rea&s;onable it be, that the Gentleman's Zeal &s;hould atone for his want of Power, yet I mu&s;t acquaint you, that his Quarrel with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation is as un|ju&s;t and groundle&s;s, as your Settling a Colony in another Man's Dominions; unle&s;s by Virtue of your Presbyterian Tenent, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Dominions being founded in Grace,</HI> you who are the Pre&s;umptive Elect pretend a Divine Right to the Goods of the Wicked, and &s;o take upon you to cloath the Seven Councellors of your Colony with &s;uch another Commi&s;&s;ion, as God gave the <HI>Hebrews</HI> when they departed out of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>I have no Inclination to offer any Thing in Oppo&s;ition to the Gallantry of your Ance&s;tors, who took &s;o much Care to keep them&s;elves in|dependent of another Nation. And altho' I pretend to know the Thread of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Story full as well as the Author of the Defence, yet out of Re&s;pect to the Coun|try where I drew my fir&s;t Breath (tho' I owe it nothing el&s;e) I will offer nothing to the Pre|judice of it's Ancient Fame: But if I point at &s;ome Errata's of this Author, I do it purely to reconcile Mi&s;takes, and to make a Di&s;tincti|on betwixt the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company, and <HI>Scots</HI>
<PB REF="6">Nation; I being &s;o much the Latter's Friend, as to wi&s;h them not to embrak in &s;o rot|ten a Bottom as this of your Company, un|til you are on an hone&s;ter Footing than you appear to be at pre&s;ent, that the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom mayn't be &s;ully'd with &s;o no|torious a Mi&s;take. I &s;hall only &s;ay in An&s;wer to this Paragraph, that altho' your Ance&s;tors were never &s;paring of their Blood in defending their Country, nay, oftimes in making Reprizal when they could conveniently; yet I mu&s;t put you in mind, that they were far better pleas'd with enjoying them&s;elves in their old <HI>Caledonian</HI> Mountains, than you are now with both Hills and Plains: And I dare &s;ay, they had &s;uch a Value for their Native Blood, that they would not have been guilty of &s;ending &s;o many inno|cent and worthy Gentlemen (like Sheep to the Slaughter, or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mines) &s;o far from Home on &s;uch an <HI>April</HI> Errand.</P>
<P>'Tis both hard and unaccountable that this Gentleman, who &s;ets up for your Champion, &s;hould u&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;o familiarly, and take &s;uch Liberty, not only of frightning them into an Ague, but to Bully a great Gene|ral, who was never hitherto known to be daunt|ed by more formidable Giants, than the <HI>Quix|ots</HI> of your Company. He, hone&s;t Gentleman, mean'd no Harm at the Granting of the <HI>Oct|roy;</HI> for, 'tis to be believed, that he could
<PB REF="6">&s;carce hear what was whi&s;per'd to him for the Noi&s;e of the <HI>Namure</HI> Guns. And as for this Project of yours to <HI>Darien,</HI> I dare be po&s;i|tive, that he knew nothing of the Matter till it was Five or Six Months done; and then he had it from other Hands.</P>
<P>If your Colony has left <HI>Darien</HI> for Rea&s;ons not as yet publick to the World, 'tis your Fault, <HI>Right Wor&s;hipful Gentlemen,</HI> in underta|king to manage a Project you &s;o little under&s;tood, and not of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to advance and pre&s;erve their own Colonies, and to keep them from being render'd de&s;olate by the Clande&s;tine Arti&s;ices of yours, who indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly and tacitely &s;pread their Declarations over all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;lands and Plantations, making u&s;e of the King of <HI>Great Britain's</HI> Name, to give the more Authority to the Thing: And by the&s;e indirect <HI>Manife&s;to's,</HI> &s;uch Pro&s;its, or rather Plunders were in&s;inuated; that if the Govern|ment of <HI>England</HI> had not taken early Mea&s;ures to prevent the ill Con&s;equences, 'tis to be que&s;ti|on'd, whether the greate&s;t Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> had not e'er now quitted their Set|tlements, and been decoy'd into your Colony, un|der a Cover'd Notion, that you had a Patent from the King, to pick a Quarrel with the <HI>Spa|niard;</HI> and to devide the Spoil of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> among&s;t the Servants and Adventures of the Company.</P>
<PB REF="7">
<P>This Project and Settlement, you know, was &s;o &s;ecretly carried on, that it was not known to <HI>England,</HI> till the &s;ame Wind that brought the News likewi&s;e, inform'd the Nation, that the <HI>Scots</HI> were march'd over to <HI>Panama</HI> (the chief City on the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> and the Trea|&s;ury-Chamber of all the <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> Riches on the South-Sea) and had planted Eighty Guns a|gain&s;t it. The&s;e Proceedings were enough to &s;tartle this Nation, who had heard of no War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and who had no great Rea&s;on to &s;uf|fer their own Subjects to de&s;ert their Plantati|ons, to advance the <HI>Scotch</HI> Colony in their own Wrong. As for this Nation's curing into a War with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> on the Score of your Company, who be&s;ides their Lo&s;s of Trade, mu&s;t throw away more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pounds (thrice over) than there's <HI>Scotch,</HI> in your Capital Stock; I'll leave it to any Man of Half an Ounce of Politicks, to find out the Je&s;t on't, &s;ave this Hot-headed Author of your Colony's Defence.</P>
<P>As for the&s;e ridiculous and bugbear Stories, which both you and your Champion in&s;inuate, <HI>viz.</HI> that if the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould lo&s;e, or be ex|pell'd out of <HI>Darien,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> will cer|tainly po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of it. This Story is &s;o far vain, that the <HI>French</HI> have another Game to play at pre&s;ent with <HI>Spain;</HI> and if they had any &s;uch Inclination that Way, they know that Coa&s;t far better than the <HI>Scots,</HI>
<PB REF="7">and might have &s;ecur'd <HI>Carthagena,</HI> when they had it in their Power, and a Legal Title to it by their Arms in the Time of a declar'd War: Which Fortification is as far before your Fort St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> or any Thing that can be made of it; as <HI>Dunkirk</HI> is before <HI>Deale</HI>-Ca&s;tle. But &s;till, if <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> had any &s;uch De&s;ign (as you would make the World believe) why mayn't they &s;till go &s;it down with|in a League of either Side of your Colony with as good a Title as yours, &s;ince you will coop the <HI>Spaniard</HI> up within his Wall'd Towns and Garri&s;ons. But to leave this unnece&s;&s;ary Di&s;pute.&mdash;</P>
<P>And proceed to the oblique Threatnings wherewith he frightens King <HI>William,</HI> to wit, the Fate of tho&s;e Mean-&s;pirited Princes, who blemi&s;h'd, and were unworthy to wear the Im|perial Crown of your Nation; I'll e&s;pou&s;e His Maje&s;ty's Cau&s;e no further than to be confirm'd, that he has been ill &s;erv'd by &s;ome Per&s;ons; and I am of Opinion, that he does not merit one Half of this ill Language at their Hands. Further, I dare &s;ay &s;o much in his Behalf, by what has pa&s;t already, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown will receive no Blemi&s;h or Di&s;reputation by his wearing of it; altho' he does not think it either &s;it or ju&s;t to Countenance an indirect Action of any of his Subjects.</P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>By the Beacons which your Author &s;ets up to &s;care him, to wit, of the Two <HI>Baliols</HI> of <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, and <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t; any Man without the Help of Spectacles may plainly perceive that he &s;ticks at nothing to advance his Cau&s;e, either by wre&s;ting or perverting the Truth of the Hi&s;tory; by rea&s;on there can be no Parity in the Example, between the &s;everal Ca&s;es of the&s;e dead Kings, whom he now brings on the Stage, and King <HI>William;</HI> nor is there any Colour of Allu&s;ion to introduce them here for Scare-crows. For the Truth of the Story runs thus: After the Death of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third, Ten or a Dozen far-fetched Relations of the Royal Family &s;tanding Competitors for the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown, it was agreed on by the different Parties (to prevent the Effu&s;ion of Blood) that the Trial of their &s;everal Claims &s;hould be re|ferr'd to <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>England. Ed|ward</HI> accepting the Office came to <HI>Berwick,</HI> then a <HI>Scots</HI> Town, where, after a long time &s;pent in canva&s;&s;ing the &s;everal Titles, he found <HI>Bruce, Baliol,</HI> and <HI>Cummin</HI> &s;tand faire&s;t for it. To make a long Tale &s;hort, he now found it in his Power to accompli&s;h that which his Predece&s;&s;ors &s;truggl'd for, for &s;ome Hun|dred Years before, to wit, a Submi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown to that of <HI>England.</HI> He felt <HI>Bruce</HI>'s Pul&s;e, but it did not beat to his Mind; then he &s;ounded <HI>Baliol,</HI> who had more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Blood in him by half than <HI>Scotch,</HI> who ea&s;ily
<PB REF="8">conde&s;cended to his Terms. <HI>Edward</HI> declares <HI>John Baliol,</HI> King of the <HI>Scots;</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility having &s;wore Allegiance to him in his Pre&s;ence, proceeded to his Coronation. That being over, the new <HI>Scots</HI> King, with his Nobility, came to King <HI>Edward,</HI> to thank him for his Civility at <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> where ha|ving been &s;plendidly regaled for &s;ome time, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King being to &s;et out for <HI>London, John Baliol,</HI> with his Train of Nobles, came in a full Body to ki&s;s his Royal Fi&s;t; where on a &s;uddain, King <HI>Baliol</HI> claps down on his Knee, and &s;wore Fealty to <HI>Edward</HI> as his So|vereign Lord, and to hold the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown for ever, of him and his Succe&s;&s;ors, Kings of <HI>England. Baliol</HI> having ended this Ceremo|ny, pointed to his Subjects to follow his Ex|ample; which being needle&s;s to di&s;pute on that Ground, no Body &s;tumbl'd at it, &s;ave a peevi&s;h Old Gentleman, by Name <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> who was Caged up for the Remainder of his Life, for want of good Manners. <HI>Baliol</HI> and his No|bility march'd home to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as chearfully as Half a Dozen Citizens Wives return to their Husbands, after they have been decoy'd into a Ramble, and ki&s;s'd by &s;trange Fellows; and they being all alike Scabby, made no Words on't for &s;ome Years, and, perhaps, had not then, if a ra&s;h Sentence had not been pa&s;s'd by <HI>Baliol</HI> in his own Court, in Prejudice of a certain Thane or Earl; who thinking him&s;elf
<PB REF="9">injur'd, appeal'd to <HI>Edward</HI> as Sovereign Lord: King <HI>Edward</HI> being willing to &s;how his Grandeur, &s;ummon'd <HI>Baliol</HI> up to <HI>London,</HI> and being &s;eated on a Throne in his Court of Judicature, his Fellow King had the Honour to &s;et by him, till &s;uch time as the Tryal came on, and then he was oblig'd to &s;tep down to the Com|mon-Bar, and Plead for him&s;elf. The Gentle|man had got &s;o much <HI>Scotch</HI> Blood in him, by his Three Years Government of that Kingdom, that he &s;tomach'd the Di&s;grace, and could not tell how to dige&s;t it, till he went Home and con|&s;ulted his Nobility, who were all alike tardy with him&s;elf: It was &s;oon agreed on, to bid <HI>Ed|ward</HI> Defiance, declaring, That their King and they were only trick'd into their Submi&s;&s;ion by his foul Artifice. Both Nations Arm'd, but <HI>Edward</HI> got the Better on't; for having over|run <HI>Scotland,</HI> and made them once or twice &s;wear heartily anew; and having caught <HI>John Baliol</HI> by the Neck, would never afterwards tru&s;t him with &s;uch an Office; but kept him Pri&s;oner at <HI>London</HI> for many Years, till at the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Pope and <HI>French</HI> King, his Impri&s;onment was enlarg'd to <HI>France,</HI> where he died a <HI>Quondam</HI> King.</P>
<P>Now, whether this Fate of <HI>John Baliol</HI> has any Relation to what your Author de&s;igns (&s;ince 'tis plain, that <HI>Edward</HI> both made and unmade him, and not the <HI>Scots)</HI> I refer it back to him|&s;elf
<PB REF="9">to reconcile. As for the other <HI>Baliol,</HI> by Name <HI>Edward,</HI> and Son to this <HI>John,</HI> he finding that <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> was the Second time dead, came from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> and, there having <HI>Edward</HI> the Third's Leave to rai&s;e what Men he could, to &s;eat him&s;elf on his Father's Old Throne, found Voluntiers e|nough (who were the Relations of tho&s;e who were foil'd at <HI>Bannocksburn)</HI> and with tho&s;e, and a few of King <HI>Edward's</HI> Ships, he lands in the Heart of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;et young <HI>Da|vid Bruce</HI>'s Crown on his own Head, without asking the <HI>Scots</HI> Leave; and kept it till <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">|vid,</HI> with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Father-in-Law the <HI>French</HI> King, took it from him again. Neither can I &s;ee the Paralel in this with King <HI>William</HI>'s Ca&s;e; for <HI>Edward Baliol</HI> took the Crown at his own Hand <HI>nolens volens,</HI> where|as King <HI>William</HI> had it pre&s;s'd upon his Head by the unanimous Con&s;ent of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation. As for the other Two Examples of <HI>James,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the First, what they did while it was their Misfortune to be Pri&s;oners in <HI>England,</HI> could not &s;tand in Law; neither did I ever hear, that after their Freedom, and Re|&s;tauration to their Dignities, their <HI>Scots</HI> Sub|jects did ever reckon it to them for Sin.</P>
<P>But as there's no great Advantage or Credit to be purcha&s;ed, by ripping up &s;uch old Sores, &s;o I am willing to leave tracing this Gentle|man's

<PB N="3" REF="12">and was one of tho&s;e who &s;ettled the I&s;land of <HI>Providence</HI> a Second time: But meeting &s;ome Hard&s;hips, and ill Luck there, to wit, a Governour being impos'd on them by the King of <HI>England,</HI> which his Con&s;cience could not admit of, the Property of their Con&s;titutions was alter'd, and they could no longer a Free Port, or Sanctuary for Buccaneers, Pyrates, and &s;uch Vermin, who had mo&s;t need of being reclaim'd into the Church: This Di&s;appoint|ment oblig'd <HI>Praedicant Pater&s;on</HI> to &s;hake the Du&s;t from off his Shooes, and leave that I&s;land under his <HI>Anathema.</HI> He return'd to <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ome Twelve Years ago, with his Head full of Projects, having all the At|chievements of Sir <HI>Henry Morgan, Batt Sharp,</HI> and the Buccaneers in his Budget: He en|deavour'd to make a Market of his Ware in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but without any Succe&s;s: He went afterwards to <HI>Berlin,</HI> o|pen'd his Pack there, and had almo&s;t caught the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> in his Noo&s;e; but that mi&s;carry'd too: He likewi&s;e im|parted the &s;ame Project to Mr. Secretary <HI>Blathwait,</HI> but &s;till with the &s;ame Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Meeting thus with &s;o many Di&s;courage|ments in the&s;e &s;everal Countries, he let his Project &s;leep for &s;ome Years, and pitch'd his Tent at <HI>London,</HI> where Matter is never want|ing to exerci&s;e plodding Heads. His former
<PB N="4" REF="13">Wife being at re&s;t as well as his Project, he wanted a Help that was meet for him, and not being very nice, went no further than the Red-fac'd Coffee-woman, a Widow in <HI>Burchin-Lane,</HI> whom he afterwards carry'd to the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien;</HI> and at her fir&s;t landing thru&s;t her about Seven Foot under Ground, to make the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>de facto</HI> of <HI>New Caledonia</HI> more authentick. While he &s;ojourn'd in <HI>London,</HI> he found Employment for his Head; and like a true Quack, boggl'd at nothing that offer'd it &s;elf to his Thought.

<P>But to proceed to the Cream of the Story, you are to under&s;tand, that E&s;quire <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> (for at his Arrival in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he acquir'd or a&s;&s;um'd an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Title) brought a Couple of Tutors, or Nur&s;es along with him, who pa&s;s'd for Partners in the Project, tho' in Ef|fect a Couple of &s;ubtle Youths, who&s;e Office was to put <HI>Pater&s;on</HI>'s creud and indige&s;ted Notions into Form.

<PB N="6" REF="14">Serrurier,</HI> and his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one <HI>James Smith.</HI> He was Ma&s;ter of mo&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> Lan|guages, and particularly of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He formerly acted as Secretary to the fam'd <HI>Italian</HI> Prince, who put &s;o many Tricks on the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with his Philo&s;ophers Stone; but at this Juncture he pa&s;s'd for a con&s;ide|rable <HI>London</HI> Merchant.

<P>So much I have offer'd by way of Preli|minary, that you may have a Glimp&s;e of the&s;e dark Pillars, by which the <HI>Scotch</HI> Com|pany was to be lighted down into the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> or <HI>Darien</HI> Mines, and over that <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> to the <HI>Phillipin</HI> I&s;lands, <HI>California, China,</HI> and to <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> it they could turn <HI>Dutch</HI> Men.</P>
<P>The Companies Act being now touch'd with the Royal Scepter, and for the more Di&s;patch, pa&s;s'd thro' the Seals <HI>per Saltum,</HI> they were empower'd by Virtue of a nece&s;|&s;ary Clau&s;e thereof, to take in Foreign Sub|&s;criptions to a le&s;&s;er half of the Capital Stock; &s;o that the main Stre&s;s of the Project lay in fingering this Money. The Three Projectors frankly engag'd to u&s;e their Intere&s;t with their Corre&s;pondents and Friends in <HI>England,
<PB N="7" REF="14">Holland,</HI> and in the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns, for 300000 <HI>l</HI> at lea&s;t; in Con&s;ideration of which, and of the Acqui&s;ition, and in Token of their Gra|titude for the Project, the Company was to give the <HI>Triumvirate</HI> 20000 <HI>l</HI> So to work all Hands went.</P>
<P>There being three different Parties in <HI>Eng|land</HI> jarring at that Time, about the <HI>India</HI> Trade, and the Old Company having got the Better on't, it was ea&s;ie to draw a great many of the Male-Contents into the <HI>Scotch</HI> Com|panies Net; nay, the Sub&s;criptions came in &s;o quick that he was the happie&s;t Man that could get his Name fir&s;t down in their Books: For <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> preach'd up only an <HI>India</HI> Trade here in <HI>England,</HI> taking no Notice of <HI>Darien,</HI> but to &s;ome Select Heads that were able to bear it; when once the Mony was in <HI>Scotl.</HI> they knew how to di&s;po&s;e of it. To be &s;hort, they had now more Money in their View than they knew what to do withal, if the Hou&s;e of Commons had not baulk'd them, and re|primanded the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> for their Foolery. The Companies Books were cary'd Home with abundance of Secrecy and Care, tho' they had as good left them behind, there having been never a Groat of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mo|ney paid in as yet. The Projectors follow'd them as the Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> did the Ark in old Times; and when they came to <HI>Scotland,</HI> their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s was to preach up the va&s;t Ad|vantages which the Hou&s;e of Commons fore|&s;aw
<PB N="8" REF="15">to acreu to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company and Na|tion. by this <HI>Octroy</HI> and Trade, and to back their Sermons with the greater Authority, the Commons Addre&s;s to the King was printed and reprinted at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> (but not a Syllable of the King's An&s;wer mention'd) which confirm'd the whole Country of the Riches they were like to be &s;urfeited with by this Act and Trade. To be &s;hort, they came in Shoals from all Corners of the Kingdom to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Rich, Poor, Blind and Lame, to lodge their Sub&s;criptions in the Compa|ny's Hou&s;e; and to have a Glimp&s;e of the Man <HI>Pater&s;on;</HI> who &s;atisfy'd them as fa&s;t as they came, that altho' they &s;ign'd &s;uch a Sum for Fa&s;hion's &s;ake, to give the Company more Reputation Abroad, yet the Quarter Part would only be demanded, there being no occa&s;ion for any more; and that they could not lie out of the U&s;e of their Money above 18 Months, or 2 Years at mo&s;t, which by that time, and the Old Cant, of God's Ble&s;|&s;ing, would fetch good Returns, and large Dividends.</P>
<P>The Companies Books had not been long open'd in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> before 400000 <HI>l</HI> was &s;ign'd (when it will be all paid in, the Lord of Ho&s;ts knows) and it now being high time to &s;hut the Books there, and go where the Money lay, to wit, the 300000 <HI>l</HI> in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns, the Projectors were con&s;ulted about it. The Re&s;ult of which was,
<PB N="9" REF="15">that they might not act precipitately in this Affair, it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould make &s;ome real Show of their Re&s;olution and For|wardne&s;s, by &s;ending a Couple of fit Per&s;ons over to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to build half a Dozen of &s;tout Ships of 50 Guns apiece; that by laying out their Money in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Country, the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> might be prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a kind Opinion of the Company, and thereby make it appear, how willing they were to extend the warm Rays of their <HI>Oct|roy,</HI> to People who de&s;erv'd it better than their ungreatful Neighbours.</P>
<P>Some warm Debates happen'd on this Oc|ca&s;sion, what Two Per&s;ons &s;hould be entru&s;ted with this mighty Affair, for by rea&s;on the Kirk and Church-money was equally in the Stock, both Parties endeavour'd to imploy their own In&s;truments. There were &s;everal Meetings on this Affair, and it was at long-run amicably concluded, that <HI>Alexander Ste|ven&s;on,</HI> late Kirk-Trea&s;urer, or Kirk-War|den of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a Zealous and Long-grace Sayer, and Capt. <HI>James Gib&s;on,</HI> Merchant and Malignant of <HI>Gla&s;co,</HI> &s;hould be the Delegates.</P>
<P>The next material Thing that came in Cour&s;e was to lodge a Stock of Ca&s;h in <HI>Lon|don</HI> to an&s;wer their Delegates nece&s;&s;ary Oc|ca&s;ions abroad: The Sum agreed on was ei|ther 18 or 20000 <HI>l</HI> but what Man to entru&s;t with this Sum that was fed on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beef and Puddin, was another He&s;itation. The
<PB N="10" REF="16">Oracle <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> being con&s;ulted herein &s;age|ly re&s;ponded, that his Brother <HI>Smith</HI>'s Bu|&s;ine&s;s requiring him to go and remain for &s;ome time at <HI>London,</HI> he expecting &s;ome Ships home from <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> wherein he had large Effects; he was of O|pinion, that they could not lodge it &s;afer than in his Hands. <HI>Smith</HI> returns to <HI>London,</HI> and having got the Gelt in his Sack, never broke his Re&s;t afterwards about the Project. The Company at the &s;ame Time had &s;ub&s;tituted Two other Ca&s;hiers abroad, to wit, Mr. <HI>Francis Stratford,</HI> Mechant, at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> (now Governour of that Company) and <HI>Alexander Hender&s;son,</HI> alias <HI>Archbi&s;shop,</HI> at <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> who were to draw from <HI>Smith</HI>'s Bank, as the Delegates had Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This <HI>Walloon</HI> Banker, and <HI>Italian</HI> Secretary an&s;wer'd the Bills punctually till a better half of the Money was extracted; about which Time finding the Company baulk'd of the <HI>Holland,</HI> as well as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub&s;crip|tions, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to hold his hand, and was pa&s;&s;ive in &s;uffering a Bill of 200 <HI>l</HI> of <HI>Stratford</HI>'s drawn on him to be prote&s;ted at <HI>London.</HI> I &s;hall leave him here for &s;ome|time, that I may bring the re&s;t along with me, and only tell you, that <HI>Smith</HI> now find|ing him&s;elf Ma&s;ter but of 8500 <HI>l</HI> of the Com|panies Ca&s;h, and not &s;ure that he &s;houlde|ver &s;ee &s;o much of it again, and looking on this as little more than his <HI>Quota</HI> for the Pro|ject

<P>The Company bit their Lips, but endea|vour'd to keep it hu&s;h for &s;ome time, that the World might not perceive how they were de&s;ervedly bubbl'd. <HI>Smith</HI> knowing their Circum&s;tances never went out of the Way for 15 or 16 Months afterwards; and then being &s;en&s;ible that if once the Compan.

<P><HI>Pater&s;on</HI> was at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> on the Emba&s;&s;ie when he heard of the Misfortune of <HI>Stratford</HI>'s Bill; but all the Mends he could make, was to &s;igh and look dull.

<P>But to return to the &s;etting out of this Emba&s;&s;ie; <HI>Steven&s;on</HI> and <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> being for &s;ome time gone over the Water to build Ships, and beat the Way for Sub&s;criptions; the next Step was to chu&s;e fit Per|&s;ons to follow and manage this Point. Five &s;uch were appointed by Name of the Committee of Fo|reign Trade, who were cloath'd with an ample Commi&s;&s;ion from the Company, to take Sub&s;crip|tions Abroad, to appoint Factors, to controul the fore&s;aid Two Legates, to provide Officers and Sea|men; and, in a Word, to do what they thought nece&s;&s;ary for the Company's Service. <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> and <HI>Smith</HI> were the fir&s;t Two,&mdash;a <HI>Scotch</HI> Merchant of <HI>London</HI> the Third.

This was ea&s;ily agreed to; and for their further Encouragment, they were in|ve&s;ted likewi&s;e with the 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ion of all the Money already laid out by Capt. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> on the two Ships, Canvas, Sails, Cables, Anchors, Powder, Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all above 10000 <HI>l</HI> which Properly was <HI>Gib&s;on</HI>'s right by his Commi&s;&s;ion from the Company. This was the fir&s;t hone&s;t &s;tep they made by Vertue of their controuling Power.</P>
<P>The&s;e new <HI>Dutch</HI> Factors ply'd their Friends all over <HI>Holland,</HI> who generally for &s;ome time before were mightily taken with the <HI>Scotch. Ea&s;t India, Trade,</HI> their Exemption from Duties for 21 years, and tickled with the Conceit that they &s;hould be Sharers in it. But through an ugly accident which happen'd in <HI>Camphire,</HI> at <HI>Pater&s;on</HI>'s and the Collonels Landing, the
<PB N="15" REF="18">whole Me&s;s of the Companies Pottage was in danger of being mi&s;cook d. The Story runs thus: The&s;e Gentlemen had a rough and tedious Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and it &s;eems the Skipper had not laid in Provi&s;ions for his Pa&s;&s;engers over plentifully, which was the occa&s;ion that <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> at his landing in <HI>Camphire</HI> (and being welcom'd and entertain'd by one <HI>Panton,</HI> a Merchant there) ta&s;ted more freely of the Creature then he us'd to do; (for he always &s;et up for a Water-biber) which <HI>Panton</HI> perceiving, ply'd him warm|ly, and took the Liberty of pumping him. <HI>Pater&s;on's</HI> Tongue running glib with the <HI>Hollands</HI> Cannal Water on the <HI>Eloginm's</HI> of the <HI>Octroy,</HI> happen'd to babble out a Secret of the Company, <HI>viz, That their Act empower'd them to give Commi&s;&s;ions to any kind of People (without asking their Nation) to Trade to the</HI> Indies <HI>under</HI> Scots <HI>Colours; and that &s;uch People might di&s;po&s;e of their</HI> India <HI>Goods where they pleas'd, pro|viding they made a &s;ham Entry in</HI> Scotland. And if the Company &s;hould agree to take 3 <HI>per Cen.</HI> for the Goods, &s;uch Ships as Traded with their Commi&s;&s;ion were able to under&s;el the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> full 17 <HI>per Cent. Panton</HI> was glad of the News, &amp; improv'd the Story among&s;t his Friends, who de&s;ign'd to &s;ign in the Companies
<PB N="16" REF="19">Books; and the&s;e run now on this Com|mi&s;&s;ion for the 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> finding it a &s;afer way of Trading, then by putting their Money in the Companies bottom; neither would they of <HI>Zealand</HI> ever afterwards en|ter on any other Terms.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner come to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> then we met with this Story fre&s;h in the Coffee-hou&s;es there. It was too late for <HI>Pa|ter&s;on</HI> to eat in his words; &s;o that all the <HI>Salvo</HI> we could make to da&s;h the Story, was by &s;aying, that this was the Com|panies &s;ho'el Anchor, if every thing el&s;e &s;hould fail them; but that they had no occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of that Power at pre&s;ent; nor that Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> meant &s;o when he &s;poke it. But that which gave us the dead &s;troke in <HI>Holland,</HI> ju&s;t as the Companies Books were open'd, the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Companies run open mouth'd to the Lords of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> &s;hew|ing what was hatching by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners in their City, to ruine the Trade of the United Provinces. The Lords gave them &s;atisfaction in the mat|ter, and made no noi&s;e of it; for we were made to under&s;tand in a day or two afterwards, that our Sub&s;criptions were da&s;h'd, and none to be expected there. On this occa&s;ion it was re&s;olved in the Commitee, that <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> and the Col|onel
<PB N="17" REF="19">&s;hould forthwith proceed to <HI>Ham|burgh,</HI> to &s;ee what could be be done there, the re&s;t being to remain in <HI>Holland</HI> for &s;ome time, to give the le&s;s Umbrage to the <HI>Hamburgh</HI> Project.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hamburghers</HI> &s;wallow'd the bait to a wi&s;h; for the more oppo&s;ition the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> offer'd to the project, con|firm'd them the more that it was their Intere&s;t to embrace it. The River <HI>Elve,</HI> on which <HI>Hamburgh</HI> &s;tands, is Navigable for flat bottom Barges of 70 or 80 Tuns, for &s;ome 200. Miles up into the Country of <HI>Germany,</HI> which gives them an oppor|tunity of &s;erving all the <HI>North</HI> parts of that <HI>Empire</HI> with Goods more convenient|ly then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> can: And as they have no <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods but what they have at &s;econd hand from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> or a few from <HI>Denmark,</HI> by joyn|ing now with the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company, they have a pro&s;pect of worming the <HI>Hollan|der</HI> out of a good part of the <HI>German</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>In <HI>Parenthe&s;i</HI> I mu&s;t own that this part of the Project was Rea&s;onable on both the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Hamburgher</HI> &s;ide, if it had been meant as it was told; but the Devil on't was, the <HI>Hamburgers</HI> knew nothing of <HI>Darien,</HI> but builded altogether on Ships laden with <HI>India</HI> Goods, whereof their
<PB N="18" REF="20">City and Port was to be the Receptacle and Mart; while <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> wanted only their Money to rai&s;e Forces to over-run <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>The way being thus prepared by the&s;e two Fore-runers, the body of the Com|mitee receiv'd advice to repair thither at &s;ight, all things being ready for Signing and Sealing. And I receiving orders to accompany them, &s;et out from <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> after we had &s;pent three Mouths there in vain; and arrived at <HI>Humburgh</HI> on <HI>La|dy-day,</HI> 1697. Our Affair was &s;o gene|rally favour'd by the Burghers of this City, that at our arrival we printed <HI>Pla|caarts,</HI> and fix'd them on the Exchange, and other publick Places there, intimating that the Companies Books were to be open'd in the <HI>Commercie Kamber</HI> the week following for Sub&s;criptions; but they were to take notice (the be&s;t Je&s;t on't) <HI>That by the Con&s;titutions of the Company, no Man could &s;ign above</HI> 3000 l. <HI>&s;terling for him&s;elf; as likewi&s;e, that their Books could not ad|mit above</HI> 200000 l. <HI>in all.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Placaarts</HI> were no &s;ooner pa&s;ted up on the Po&s;ts, than Pamphlets were crying up and down the Streets, full of ill Nature, and a great many &s;ad Truths; advi&s;ing the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> to enquire fur|ther into the Project, before they parted
<PB N="19" REF="20">with their Money, le&s;t they &s;hould ne|ver &s;ee it again. The&s;e Pamphlets con|tain'd 3 or 4 Sheets, and were printed in <HI>French, High</HI> and <HI>Low Dutch,</HI> under the Title of, <HI>A Letter from a Friend in</HI> Am&s;ter|dam, <HI>to his Friend in</HI> Hamburgh. But the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> having &s;uch a Confidence in <HI>Pater&s;on</HI>'s Phiz, and &s;mooth Tongue, and by the forward appearance the Com|pany made with their new Ships of 50 Guns all in a row, they believ'd all this &s;tuff, to be hatch'd in <HI>Samaria,</HI> from whence no good can be expected.</P>
<P>But that the Scriptures might be ful|fill'd, <HI>by the Elects meeting with Di&s;appoint|ments and Cro&s;&s;es while they &s;ojourn here;</HI> or on the other hand, <HI>that of Hone&s;ty's be|ing the be&s;t Policy,</HI> either you plea&s;e; the Companies Book was likewi&s;e &s;hut up here, without getting a Groat of the <HI>Ham|burgers</HI> Money, although that City got near 30000 <HI>l</HI> of the Company's. The human rea&s;on of this Di&s;appointment, if I am not mi&s;taken, was as follows; in the <HI>Octroy</HI> there was a certain unnece&s;&s;ary Pa|ragraph, which occa&s;ion'd a great many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollands</HI> Speculations, <HI>viz. That in ca&s;e the Company &s;hould be interrupted in their Trade,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the King had ingag'd to interpo&s;e the Regal Authority to do them Right, and that at the publick Charge. Pa|ter&s;on,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="21">and the other Agents of the Com|pany, to magnifie their Charter, did in|&s;inuate in all Companies, <HI>That the King was to a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend them with his Ships of War, or otherwi&s;e, if there was occa&s;ion, and that out of his own Pocket, which they did not que&s;tion to be Engli&s;h Coin;</HI> when at the &s;ame time, the words of the Act cannot bear it; much le&s;s, That a <HI>Scots</HI> Act of Parliament &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships and Money. But &s;ince the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company would force this glo&s;s on the Text for their Advantage, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tra|ders to <HI>India</HI> made as profitable a u&s;e of it the other way; for &s;ay they, Was it not enough that the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s an Act in favour of his <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects to Trade to <HI>India,</HI> and exempt them from Duties for 21 years, which is an evitable Prejudice to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, &s;ince it's impo&s;&s;ible to hinder them from &s;ending their <HI>India</HI> Goods by &s;tealth over the Border, and under&s;elling our Markets by 25, or 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> but that they &s;hould be empower'd to take in For|reigners to be Sharers with them in this Trade; and not only thereby &s;uck the Blood and Marrow out of <HI>England</HI> for 21 years, but that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships of War (for the maintenance of which great Tax|es and Impo&s;ts are laid on our Trade and
<PB N="21" REF="21">Goods) &s;hould defend this <HI>Scotch</HI> Compa|ny's Trade, and the&s;e Foreigners who run away with the whole.</P>
<P>The&s;e weak Proceedings of <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> and the other Agents, with the Sentiments the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had of it, made the Govern|ment of <HI>England,</HI> &s;end to the Senate of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> a Caution by Sir <HI>Paul Ricaut,</HI> Re&s;ident there, to take care how they &s;uffer'd their Burghers to embark with private Men, the King's Subjects, under the hopes of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Protection, which being to the Prejudice of their own Sub|jects, could not be rea&s;onably expected. This was the Sub&s;tance of the Memorial given in to that Senate, who had never hi|therto countenanc'd the Committee, altho' the Private Burghers were &s;o Re&s;olute to Join.</P>
<P>Adver&s;e Fortune &s;till attending our Em|ba&s;&s;ie, they thought fit to &s;teer home|wards, and make the be&s;t of a bad Market, being now fully &s;atisfy'd that there's no other Body's Money to be Tru&s;ted to but their own: And having left me with Le|gate <HI>Steven&s;on</HI> to tend the Ships till farther Orders; they &s;et out from <HI>Hamburgh</HI> in <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>The Report of this Mournful Story be|ing made to the Board in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they found that they had been hatching rotten
<PB N="22" REF="22">Eggs for a Twelvemonth by-gone: But that which was &s;till wor&s;e, 50000 <HI>l</HI> was &s;unk into <HI>Dutchland</HI> on Ships that were nei|ther fit for Merchants Service nor War, 8500 <HI>l</HI> &s;unk in <HI>Smith</HI>'s Pocket, a Cargoe of all &s;orts of Goods and Materials for a Plan|tation ready bought, <HI>viz. Scotch</HI> Cloath 8000 pieces White, <HI>ditto</HI> Brown 4 or 5000. <HI>ditto</HI> died and &s;trip'd 2000. Sterling Sear|ges 8000 Ells, Men and Womens Shoes 5 or 6000 pair, Slippers about 1500, pair, Mens coar&s;e Stockings 4000 pair, Wo|mens <HI>ditto</HI> 2000 pair, <HI>Scotch</HI> Hats a great quantity, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bibles 1500, Periwigs 4000. &s;ome Long, &s;ome Short, Campaigns, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bobs and Natural ones; and truly they were all Natural, for being made of <HI>Highlanders</HI> Hair, which is blanch'd, with the Rain and Sun, when they came to be open'd in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> they look'd like &s;o many of <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s Fire&s;hips that he &s;ent among&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> and could be of no u&s;e to the Colony, if it were not to mix with their Lime when they pla&s;ter'd the Walls of their Hou&s;es. This was all the Merchandable Cargoe, &s;ave about 500 <HI>l</HI> worth of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> Linen and <HI>Holland,</HI> and to the &s;ame value of little Trincums bought in <HI>Holland</HI> for a <HI>Guinea</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, and about 2 or 3 Hog&s;heads of Bees-wax. The re&s;t was in Materials for
<PB N="23" REF="22">the Colony, <HI>viz.</HI> Hoes, Axes, Matches, Knives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And for the main De&s;ign 1500 &s;pare Buccaneer-Pieces, &s;ome Hun|dreds of Barrels of Powder, Shot proporti|onable and about 80 or 90 Drums. This Cargoe of Merchandize and Materials for the Colony, amounted to about 19000 <HI>l</HI> including 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> advance, which the Company charg'd on every Article. So that there was about 74000 of the 100000 <HI>l</HI> Sunk. The remainder was towards Pro|vi&s;ions, Payment of the Sailors and other Servants of the Company, and Di&s;charge of the Company's Civil Li&s;t: But of this odd Money above 10000 <HI>l</HI> was deficient in the Payments, to wit, &s;ome great Men could not be forc'd to pay, they Natively thinking their Countenance to the thing to be enough for their &s;hare; others were Sick, and a great many &s;tark Dead of the Project, but mo&s;t of them not able to rai&s;e their <HI>Quota.</HI></P>
<P>The Company's Affairs looking now &s;o pale-fac'd, they were for &s;ome time &s;tagger|ing in their Re&s;olutions: And on this Occa|&s;ion it was propos'd to the Board by the Laird of <HI>Drummellier,</HI> a Topping and Lead|ing Man of the Company, and back'd by <HI>Robert Wat&s;on,</HI> a Leading Man among&s;t the Merchant Directors, that they &s;hould &s;end Order to their Agents in <HI>Holland</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="23"><HI>Hamburgh</HI> to &s;ell off the Ships, and that their Committee of homeward Improvements &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of the fore&s;aid Cargoe to the be&s;t Advantage, and the Company to make a Dividend of the Product, among&s;t the Proprietors of the Stock. This Propo|&s;al was Rejected as Inglorious, and they being now <HI>in utrumque Parati,</HI> were Re|&s;olv'd <HI>Seu var&s;are dolos,</HI> and that their Ser|vants, but not them&s;elves, &s;hould be the Victims to the <HI>Certae occumbere Morti.</HI></P>
<P>From this Minute they fixt their Re&s;olu|tions, that &s;ince their Ships were built, the Provi&s;ions, Cargoe, and other Nece&s;&s;a|ries already provided, they &s;hould not look back, but equip for Sea with all Ex|pedition; if they Peri&s;h there, or the Pro|ject Mi&s;carry, they could &s;hew the World that they drove the Nail &s;o far as it would go, and at la&s;t, &s;hift the Mi&s;carriage from off them&s;elves. And to &s;atisfie the World that their De&s;pair was evident; at the &s;ign|ing of the Company's la&s;t In&s;tructions to the Colony, This <HI>Drummellier</HI> would have it added in the Po&s;t&s;cript as a Benediction, That they &s;hould get Money Hone&s;tly if they could, but be &s;ure to get it, and if they came Home without it, then the Devil get them all.</P>
<P>By the &s;equel of the Story the Reader
<PB N="25" REF="23">may judge whether they did not put this Re&s;olution into Practice. After the Em|ba&s;&s;ie or Committee of Foreign Trade left <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> nothing Remarkable pa&s;t there, &s;ave that after Mr. <HI>Stratford</HI> had given them a Splendid Entertainment for their Foy, they went off without bidding him ki&s;s there&mdash;and believing that all the&s;e Di&s;hes were a Pig of their own Sow, left In&s;tructions behind them that he &s;hould not act any longer as the Company's Ca&s;hier. Whether this was the True Rea&s;on of his being laid a&s;ide, or that of his Original Sin, I cannot re&s;olve you; but this I know, that he gave them Credit at their fir&s;t appear|ance in <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> indented with the Buil|der of the four Ships, with the Ropemakers, Black&s;miths, and other Artificers, to fur|ni&s;h the Company, and bound him&s;elf for performance of the &s;everal Contracts; and at la&s;t he was oblig'd to Arre&s;t the &s;ame Ships (as they were &s;itting out) for 800 <HI>l</HI> Flemi&s;h, that being the Ballance of his Accompts; and they lay in <HI>Limbo</HI> a Fort|night or three Weeks before this Money could be paid.</P>
<P>We Sail'd with two of the&s;e Ships, <HI>viz,</HI> the <HI>Caledonia</HI> and St. <HI>Andrew</HI> from the Ri|ver of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> the 10 of <HI>November,</HI> 1697. (having left the other two behind us, rea|dy Launch'd and lying to Rot in the Ou&s;e)
<PB N="26" REF="24">and arriv'd in <HI>Leith</HI> Road on the 20th. to the no &s;mall Joy of the Proprietors of the Stock, two Thirds of whom firmly be|liev'd for &s;ix Months by-gone that all was Cheat, and that there was no &s;uch Ships in <HI>Rerum Natura.</HI></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun</HI> of 60 Guns, and the <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> of 46, were fallen down from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to the <HI>Texel,</HI> in order to joyn us, that we might make our Parade the more Splendid in <HI>Leith</HI> Road. The&s;e Ships, you mu&s;t know, had their Complement of Men bore on them for &s;everal Months before, as if they had been ready to Sail; but Archbi&s;hop <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> their tru&s;ty Friend and Agent, having about 3000 <HI>l</HI> due to him and Partners, did not think it di&s;creet to let both Ships go till he had the Money in his Pocket; &s;everal kind Epi&s;tles and civil Words pa&s;t between the Company and him on this occa&s;ion, but to no material purpo&s;e; for he was ap|prehen&s;ive that if once they got the Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Money might be like Butter in the Black Dog's Hauce, or that they might detain &s;o much of it as came to the <HI>Quota</HI> of his and Partners Sub&s;criptions, which he and they had no Inclination to. On the&s;e Con&s;iderations the Archbi&s;hop &s;ent home the <HI>&V;nicorn,</HI> and brought the Com|pany's <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun</HI> back to the <HI>Meridian</HI> of
<PB N="27" REF="24"><HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where &s;he being Frozen up, for that Sea&s;on, was oblig'd to lie till &s;he Thaw'd, and for &s;ome Months afterwards, till he had his Dutch <HI>Gilt</HI> again. And in|deed I think the Accident was very lucky, for be&s;ides the Honour which the Company purchas'd by entertaining the Czar of <HI>Mo&s;|covy</HI> Aboard while &s;he lay at the Pales of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> if &s;he had gone to the <HI>West-In|dies,</HI> &s;he might have &s;et there and never ri|&s;en again; and &s;o <HI>Drummellier</HI> would have been di&s;appointed of his Dividend.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hamburgher</HI> Ships and the <HI>&V;nicorn,</HI> being arriv'd at <HI>Leith,</HI> it was re&s;olv'd to car|ry them up the <HI>Fryth</HI> till the harde&s;t of the Winter was over; but the Seamen (a great part of whom had been 11 or 12 Months in the Service, and as void of Faith as Mo|ney) would not move an inch till they were paid, altho' &s;everal of the Directors came Aboard to Interpo&s;e their Authority. This oblig'd a certain Committee to be appoint|ted for their Payment, who brought down the Money to <HI>Leith,</HI> and endeavouring to &s;how them&s;elves Good Husbands for the Company, pinch'd may be 5, 6 or 7 Shil|lings out of each Man's Wages, (not for Dammages, for there was no Goods) which oblig'd the Sailors to give them a hearty Cur&s;e to their Faces, &s;o &s;oon as they had got the Money in their Hats. All that
<PB N="28" REF="25">was &s;av'd in the <HI>Caledonia</HI> by this Manage|ment was within 40 <HI>l</HI> And when I told Little <HI>Blackwood</HI> my Sentiments of it at the Pay-Table, he reply'd, that it was no mat|ter, every Little makes a Mickle, and the Company had need to &s;ave all they can. The Con&s;equence of this was, that when the Company had occa&s;ion to fit out their Ships in the Spring, none of the&s;e Sailors that were worth the hanging, would Li&s;t them&s;elves, and we were oblig'd to take Tag, Rag and Bobtail, and &s;uch as no Skipper in the <HI>Fryth</HI> would Eatertain. The Company indeed depended on their Country-Men who were di&s;charg'd of the Engli&s;h Service on the Peace, but they were di&s;appointed, for none of them would leave Old <HI>England.</HI> So that when we came to Sea, we were &s;o feebly Mann'd, (altho' we had Eaters enough) that if it had not been for the Land Officers and their Men, I am &s;atisfy'd that our Ships had run away with us.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> following, the Ships being ready to Sail, the Sea-men were paid off, and for their farther Encouragement, receiv'd 2 Months Pay Advance; as for the re&s;t, tho&s;e who are alive, mu&s;t catch it if they can, tho' it may be gue&s;s'd what they have to tru&s;t to, by the Defences which the Company makes at this time in <HI>Doctors-Commons,</HI> in an
<PB N="29" REF="25">Action of Sea Wages they are &s;ued for. To wit, that the Company Transfer'd their Ships, Men and Cargo, over to the Collonie; that they are now two di&s;tinct Societies, that what Wages were due by the Company, were paid before the Ships went from <HI>Scotland;</HI> and altho' the Com|pany advanc'd the fore&s;aid two Months Pay, yet it was not on their own account, but lent to the Collonie. This is a pretty ho|ne&s;t Eva&s;ion of the Company to cheat &s;o many poor Men out of their Wages: I don't know what &s;ucce&s;s &s;uch Defences will meet with in their own Courts, but they are now rejected in <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> and the Money order'd to be brought into the Court.</P>
<P>But before I go any further, I'll give you a clearer View of this Transfer. The Company having laid out a round Summ of Money on this Expedition, thought the mo&s;t probable way of &s;eeing it again, was to charge the Collonie with it, to let them improve it the be&s;t way they could, and pay the Company certain Parcels of it at &s;uch and &s;uch Terms. They valu'd the&s;e three Ships and Cargo, with the two Tenders, (including the Provi&s;ions and Mens Wages they had already paid) at 70000 <HI>l</HI> for which they took the Coun|cils Bond to be paid as afore&s;aid. They
<PB N="30" REF="26">were likewi&s;e to have certain &s;hares in the Mines, Minerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to be free of Duties in the <HI>Collonies</HI> Ports, whereas Strangers were to pay 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> (which was to be apply'd to the maintenance of the Collonies Forts, and other nece&s;&s;ary U&s;es.) The&s;e Gentlemen, who gave their joynt Bond for this 70000 <HI>l</HI> were not worth &s;o many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pence; and the Tran&s;fer was &s;o clande&s;tinely carried on, that if it had been known to the Sea-men, or tho&s;e who expected Wages, there had not one Soul of them gone in the Service. And I dare be po&s;itive, that when we ar|riv'd in <HI>Darien,</HI> this Transfer was &s;uch a &s;ecret, that it was not known to ten Men be&s;ides the Councellors.</P>
<P>The Seamen being thus paid by the Com|pany what was due to them, with the two Months advance, were made believe that when once the&s;e Landmen were &s;et a&s;hore, they were to proceed on <HI>a</HI> Trading Voyage, and return to <HI>Scotland</HI> to be paid, where|with they were well enough &s;atisfy'd. The Landmen were &s;till in wor&s;e Circum&s;tan|ces, for they had no Pay, nor none to tru&s;t to; only the hopes they were faten'd with of picking the Gold off the Leaves of the Trees, which few of them doubted of, that went on that foot. For the more formality of the thing, and to make it of a greater value,
<PB N="31" REF="26">there was a kind of Indenture or Contract between the Company and the&s;e Landmen. The Soldiers were not to go under that De|nomination, but that of Planters. The 60 Officers (12 of them had been Captains in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the other 48 &s;ubalterns) were term'd Over-&s;eers, Sub-Over&s;eers and A&s;&s;i|&s;tants. The true My&s;tery of their cramp Names lay here, if I am not mi&s;taken: The <HI>Octroy</HI> empower'd the Company to li&s;t and entertain Soldiers for the Service of their Collonies, and to exerci&s;e Martial Di&s;ci|pline; but at the &s;ame time, what Souldi|ers they li&s;ted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> mu&s;t be with the Privy Councils leave fir&s;t obtain'd. At the li&s;ting and enrolling of the&s;e Land-men, the Company thought it in vain to ask the Council that &s;avour, for &s;ome weighty Rea&s;ons, which I &s;hall not offer here; &s;o took their own way of Chri&s;t'ning them, de&s;igning at the &s;ame time to make them an&s;wer the &s;ame ends, when once they got them between the <HI>Tropicks;</HI> and in the mean time, it was not nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Land Officers, or Planting Soldiers &s;hould know the &s;ecret of their Infirmity. I mu&s;t tell you, that <HI>Pennycook,</HI> and &s;ome more of the Council were &s;o ignorant of it, that if it had not been for one who was none of their Number, they had hang'd up &s;ome of the Land-men at Sea, to try their hand.
<PB N="32" REF="27">And after we had been a while in the Col|lony, and the poor Men &s;o &s;tarv'd, that they were oblig'd to de&s;ert to any body that could fill their Bellies, &s;ome 9 or 10 of the&s;e were brought back by a party; and &s;ince they found they could not hang them, without running the hazard of being hang'd them&s;elves for it afterwards, they chain'd great Weights of Iron to their Leggs, and condemn'd them for a certain number of years to Slavery. The&s;e Act|ings were as unlegal as the other; for if by the Con&s;titutions of the Collony their Port be free, and if the&s;e Men be Planters by the Indenture or Contract made with the Company, they are Freemen, and not ly|able to the la&s;h of Martial Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The Terms of the&s;e Indentures run thus, <HI>That the Planters &s;hould be mantain'd by the Company three Years; and what Ground they clear'd in that time, &s;hould be di&s;pos'd of by the Colony, as they &s;hould think fit; allowing</HI> 50 <HI>Acres to each Planter, with a Hou&s;e in the Capital City of</HI> 50 <HI>foot &s;quare;</HI> 100 <HI>Acres to each Officer, with a Hou&s;e proporti|onable.</HI> And to &s;et the greater value on that rich land, the Councellors them&s;elves, by the Con&s;titutions, could not have above three Portions, to wit, 150 Acres. The&s;e poor deluded Fellows had better &s;old them|&s;elves for the time in &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="27">or <HI>French</HI> Plantations, and have got 18 or 20 <HI>l</HI> by the bargain, without either running the hazard of &s;tarving, or of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mines. And altho' there had been no dan|ger of either, yet what could a naked man make of this 50 Acres of Ground, or of 500, at the three years end, if it were not to &s;ow Potatoes, Maez, and Plantains, and live as <HI>Adam</HI> did.</P>
<P>This is all the Encouragement the&s;e Gentlemen and Planters had to tru&s;t to; and altho' mo&s;t, or all the Officers had been li&s;ted 4 or 5 Months before they were &s;hip'd aboard, yet they had not a farthing allow'd them for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, but what the 12 Captains or Over&s;eers could pinch out of their Companies; neither could that be much, for their Planters were allow'd but 3 <HI>d.</HI> a day for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, from the date of their li&s;ting, to their going on board; indeed about a Month before we &s;ail'd, upon a certain occa&s;ion of the Land Officers grumbling, the Directors, out of their Benevolence, or rather to &s;top their Mouths, order'd 10 <HI>l</HI> for each Cap|tain, with a Sub&s;cription of 100 <HI>l</HI> in the Capital Stock (which was only 25 <HI>l</HI> Gift,) and for the Subalterns in Proportion; which generous Gratuity made all things ea&s;ie.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="28">
<P>The Contract or Charter Party between the Company and Council, was penn'd before the Councellors were created; but that &s;ignify'd little, for the&s;e Candidates would &s;carce have &s;tuck at the Terms, tho' they had been harder. But to tell you the truth, they were to &s;eek for Per|&s;ons fit for that purpo&s;e, and were glad to take &s;uch as they could get. By the Con|&s;titutions a greed on by <HI>Rozy Mackenzie,</HI> and the Company, &s;even Councellors were to be created before the Ships &s;ail'd from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the&s;e were to be inve&s;ted with a Power to a&s;&s;ume to the number of &s;ix more, as they &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion. I have rea&s;on to believe that the de&s;ign of leaving the&s;e &s;ix Chairs vacant, was for the Encouragement of &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Men of Sub&s;tance, as &s;hould come in and joyn them from the <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Planta|tions.</P>
<P>To give you the Characters at large of the&s;e 7 Councellors, would be tedious; wherefore I de&s;ire you may accept of this in &s;hort. 1.

<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you of our Clergy, with whom I ought, in good
<PB N="37" REF="29">Manners, to have begun. Two Mini&s;ters with a Journey-Man to take up the P&s;alm, were commi&s;&s;ion'd by the General A&s;|&s;embly, with full In&s;tructions, I &s;uppo&s;e, to di&s;po&s;e of the Bibles among the <HI>Indi|ans.</HI> One of the&s;e was an Extraordinary good Man, but he ow'd his Education to the Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Kirk Ru&s;t was rubb'd off him. The other was Young Head&s;trong, as infallible as his Ho|line&s;s, Sawcy and as Impertinent as the Mo|derator him&s;elf.

<P>But before I leave <HI>Europe</HI> altogether; I mu&s;t tell you One Pa&s;&s;age more, which was a Secret to a great Part of the Court of Directors when we left <HI>Scotland,</HI> it being manag'd only by the private Committee, and 2 or 3 more. The Story runs thus, The Companyes, or rather private Com|mittees Agents at <HI>London,</HI> had been for &s;ome time in Terms with <HI>Lionel Wafer</HI> to bring him into the Service, they had no po&s;itive In&s;tructions to agree with him at fir&s;t, but only to &s;ound him as to the Par|ticulars of the Country of <HI>Darien. Wafer,</HI> it &s;eems, was in Terms with &s;ome private Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> about &s;ending a Ve&s;&s;el thither for <HI>Nicaragua</HI> Wood, to which he was to <HI>Pilot</HI> them; and about the &s;ame Time he was putting his Journals into the Pre&s;s. <HI>Pennycook,</HI> before he left <HI>London,</HI> went with Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman and &s;ome others de&s;ignedly to di&s;cour&s;e this <HI>Wafer,</HI> and having treated him at <HI>Pontacks,</HI> &s;atisfy'd them&s;elves of his Capacity to &s;erve the Company, they ad|vis'd him not to be ha&s;ty in Publi&s;hing his Book, or at lea&s;t till he heard further from <HI>Scotland.</HI> There was a Collection of &s;ome <HI>Gui|neas</HI> among&s;t the&s;e Gentlemen for <HI>Wafer,</HI> the better to back their Advice. When <HI>Penny|cook</HI> arriv'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> he acquainted the pri|vate
<PB N="39" REF="30">Committee with his Sentiments of <HI>Wafer,</HI> on which they wrote for Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> by the next Po&s;t to &s;ecure him for the Companies Service, and to make the ea&s;ie&s;t Bargain he could.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI> had &s;tood for &s;ome Months by-gone at 1000 <HI>l</HI> but now Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> being in Earne&s;t with him he agreed on the following Terms.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He was to &s;erve the Company for the Space of 2 Years in their Expedition, for which the Company was to pay him 750 <HI>l</HI> whereof 50 <HI>l</HI> ready down.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He was forthwith to proceed to <HI>E|dinburgh,</HI> and there to an&s;wer &s;uch Que|&s;tions as the private Committee or Commit|tee of Trade &s;hould ask him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In Con&s;ideration of 20 <HI>Guineas</HI> more, which hethen received in hand, he was to put a Stop to the Publi&s;hing his Book for the &s;pace of a Month; and when he came to <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> if the Company and he could not come to Terms for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it altoge|ther, then he was either at Liberty to go in their Service for the fore&s;aid 700 <HI>l</HI> or to return to <HI>England,</HI> which he pleas'd.</ITEM>
<PB N="40" REF="31">
<ITEM>4. You may ea&s;ily perceive &s;omething, My&s;tical in the wording of the&s;e Articles, whereby the Company might &s;hake their Neck out of their Noo&s;e, but that Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> mean't it &s;o, I will not &s;ay, but am rather willing to believe he was &s;incere and ignorant of the Companies De&s;ign on him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wafer,</HI> Pur&s;uant to the Contract, (having order'd his Affairs in <HI>England</HI> for his Voyage to <HI>Darien,</HI>) took Po&s;t for <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and on the Road pa&s;t by the Name of <HI>Brown,</HI> by the Committees Direction. He was &s;topt at <HI>Haddinton,</HI> 12 Miles &s;hort of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Pennycook,</HI> who was or|der'd to Lodge him at Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Hou&s;e, about 2 Miles Wide of that Road, and there he was to &s;tay till the Committee &s;hould come to him, lea&s;t by his going into <HI>Edinburgh</HI> he &s;hould be &s;een by <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> or <HI>Lodge,</HI> (who at this Time were kept in the Dark as to the Companies Re&s;olutions,) or by any other Per&s;on that might know him. The private Committee came to him next Day, and having enter'd on Bu|&s;ine&s;s, askt him fir&s;t, if he had order'd his Affairs &s;o in <HI>England</HI> that he needed not return. He an&s;wered that he had, and
<PB N="41" REF="31">was ready to go abroad at 48 Hours warn|ing: To this they reply'd, that it was very well, tho'by the Sequel of the Story you'll find it none of their Meaning.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t 2 or 3 Days Conferences, the Subject of the Di&s;cour&s;e was <HI>Darien,</HI> of which he unbo&s;&s;om'd him&s;elf freely. And for their further Incouragement, he ingaged to lead them to a Trea&s;ure of <HI>Nicaragua</HI> Wood, whereof 300 Men could cut down &s;o much in Six Months, as &s;hould defray the whole Charge of the Expeditinn, which if he did not perform he &s;hould forfeit his Title to the 700 <HI>l Premium</HI> agreed on. The Gentlement were curious in Inform|ing them&s;elves whereabouts this Trea&s;ure was, whither it was near the Sea or any River whence it could be ea&s;ily Shipt Aboard. <HI>Wafer,</HI> not &s;u&s;pecting any De|&s;ign upon him by Per&s;ons of &s;o noted Cha|racters, re&s;olv'd them in every Particular, and pointed out the very Spot of Ground, where it grows, with the Bearings and Di&s;tance of it from Golden <HI>I&s;land.</HI> They now think|ing them&s;elves Cock-&s;ure of the Trea&s;ure, and &s;ufficiently In&s;tructed as to the Coun|try, had no more Occa&s;ion for <HI>Wafer,</HI> and believ'd that the 700 <HI>l</HI> Pilotage might be &s;av'd, to help to fetch up <HI>Smith</HI>'s Summ.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="32">
<P>Next Night he has brought into <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> under Pretence of a nearer Commu|nication, and was lodg'd in a private Cell near the Companies Office Three Pair of Stairs high, where he could &s;carce di&s;tin|gui&s;h between Sun Light and Moon Light; and here he was oblig'd to keep clo&s;e lea&s;t by being &s;een abroad the Project &s;hould take Air. <HI>Wafer</HI> was well enough pleas'd with his Confinement, having &s;till the 700 <HI>l</HI> in View; but as there's no Certainty in Sublunary Things, &s;o the <HI>Pilot</HI> mi&s;t of his Mark; for in a Day or two afterwards &s;ome Gentlement of the Committee came to him and with abundance of Concern, made him under&s;tand, that the Project had taken Wind in <HI>England,</HI> that Admiral <HI>Bembo</HI> was lying with a Squadnon at <HI>Spithead,</HI> to wait their Motion; and that it was re|&s;olv'd that very Morning, in the Secret Committee, to alter their <HI>Darien</HI> Project. <HI>Wafer</HI> being &s;omewhat daunted at the News, had but little to &s;ay to the Matter: And the&s;e Gentlemen to blind him the more, ask'd him &s;everal Que&s;tions about the Rivers of <HI>Platte</HI> and <HI>Amazones</HI> (both 1000 Leagues wide of <HI>Darien,</HI>) and whe|ther he could be &s;erviceable to them that way; to which he an&s;wered, No.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="32">
<P>Thus they parted from him, &s;hew|ing a great Concern for their own Di&s;appointment, as well as his; tell|ing him withal, That &s;ince they could not go in his <HI>Darien</HI> Project, they would think of a Gratuity &s;it for him, which he might expect that Even|ing.</P>
<P>This Gratuity was the Sum of Twen|ty <HI>Guineas,</HI> which he receiv'd by the Hand of Mr. <HI>Pennycook:</HI> And I &s;uppo&s;e he was now at Liberty to Print his Book, for I think he was ne|ver &s;o much as Commun'd with about it. I was order'd to &s;ee him out of Town, which gave me an Opportu|nity of having the mournful Story Re|capitulated, whereof neither he nor I at that time knew the Draught. It was not nece&s;&s;ary to enjoin <HI>Wafer</HI> to conceal his <HI>Scotch</HI> Journey from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> his own Intere&s;t obliging him to keep it hu&s;h, &s;ince the greate&s;t Remedy he could expect was to be laught at. However, I dare &s;ay, he hath acquired &s;o little Knowledge of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> (except what he learn'd of the Company,) that if he were to re|turn
<PB N="44" REF="33">to that City, he could no more find the Way to his Lodging, than the Company could to the <HI>Nicaragua</HI> Wood, notwith&s;tanding they thought them&s;elves &s;o &s;ure of it by Directi|ons.</P>
<P>I was afterwards one of tho&s;e who went for &s;everal Miles along the Coa&s;t, in Search of this Trea&s;ure, but were oblig'd to give it o'er: And in Lieu of this, our Men were order'd to fell &s;everal kinds of &s;trange Trees, which naturally grow in the Colony's Garden.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;quared and cut in Ten Foot Peices, for the ea&s;ier Stowage, and were to be &s;ent Home by the fir&s;t Ship, to &s;ee if the Company's Virtuo&s;o's could find any <HI>Lebanon</HI> a|mong&s;t them.</P>
<P>When they come, I dare &s;ay, they will Puzzle the General A&s;&s;embly to find Names for them all, for I can &s;carce think that Old Nunkle trotted &s;o far <HI>We&s;t</HI> to Chri&s;ten them.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="33">
<P>But that I may now take leave of the Com|pany (whom I am unwilling to part with as yet if it were not for fouling too much Pa|per) and hale my Top&s;ail-&s;heets home for my Voyage to <HI>Darien:</HI> I mu&s;t acquaint you that about 7 or 8 months before we &s;ail'd, a Committee was order'd for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> for the victualling and &s;itting out of the Fleet. I was ordered to a&s;&s;i&s;t at two or three meetings of this Committee with my advice in the Victualling part (that for &s;ome time before lying within my Province) and they having told me that 900 men was the Compliment they de&s;ign'd for this Expe|dition, and that they mu&s;t regulate the daily expence according to the &s;tore they had, &s;o as to make it hold out 9 months; this was &s;oon done, and if we had been ready to &s;ail then, the Provi&s;ions might have held out ac|cording to the calculation: but our Ma&s;ters being no Witches at their craft a third of their Provi&s;ions were expended before we could be ready to &s;ail. There was none to be had in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and if there had there was no Money to go to Market; the 100000 <HI>l</HI> being &s;unk, and the Companies credit not worth two pence, not|with&s;tanding the glorious &s;how our Ships made from the Ca&s;tle-hill of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> And I have rea&s;on to believe, that we had &s;tuck there as well as the <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun</HI> did in the <HI>Pom|po&s;&s;e,</HI> if it had not been for &s;ome few Pillars of the Company who mortgag'd their E&s;tates
<PB N="46" REF="34">for 4 or 5000 <HI>l</HI> for which the Company made over the two new Ships at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and the <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun</HI> at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> for their &s;ecurity. It was not convenient to let our men know the ill &s;tate of our Provi&s;ions; but on the o|ther hand, there was &s;uch a noi&s;e made or our plenty, and of our having a twelve months &s;tore of all kinds for 1000 men, that it was like to have &s;et us all by the ears together be|fore we were long at Sea. This management was principally due to Mr. <HI>Robert Blackwood</HI> one of that Committee, a little bu&s;y-body, who took this part of it upon him, and is now in di&s;grace for the &s;ame. Whether he de&s;erves it altogether him&s;elf I will not &s;ay; but however, the Company thinks it nece&s;&s;a|ry he &s;hould be the Sacrifice, altho one half of their Collars is not enough to attone for what &s;o many brave Fellows has &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Having &s;ail'd from <HI>Leith</HI> about three days I acquainted Mr. <HI>Pennycook</HI> with my doubts as to the Provi&s;ions, and how nece&s;&s;ary it was the Council &s;hould be &s;atisfied of our &s;tore be|fore it were too late. Next day he made the Signal for the Coun&s;ellors to repair on board, and the Pur&s;ers of the &s;everal Ships were or|dered to lay an account before them of what Provi&s;ions they &s;tood charged with. This done, I was ordered to calculate the whole and make a Report how long the &s;tore would hold out at the u&s;ual allowance for 1050 men, our Compliment being thereabouts. I could
<PB N="47" REF="34">not make above 5 months and a half of any &s;pecie except Stock-fi&s;h, of which we had full 11 months, and that at 4 days of the week, but had not above 4 months Butter and Oyl to it. The Council de&s;ign'd to put into the <HI>Orkney's</HI> to &s;end an Expre&s;s to the Company and give them an account of the &s;late of Pro|vi&s;ions, but meeting with thick and bad wea|ther in the pa&s;&s;ing of them, we were obliged to go on; and having calculated that &s;tore to hold out 9 months, our men were forthwith put to that &s;harp allowance. This occa&s;ion'd ill blood enough, and I was like to have got my throat cut for being the Author of it. As for our Drink, we had not above ten tunn of Beer in our Navy when we left <HI>Leith;</HI> but in lieu thereof we were a&s;&s;ur'd by the Company, that we &s;hould take in Wine at <HI>Madera's,</HI> for which they had &s;ent us credit on Mr. <HI>Miles,</HI> who had Effects in his hands of one <HI>William Arbuckles</HI> a Director; dut being come thither, we found this to be a mi&s;take, to &s;ay no wor&s;e on't. Our men now being at &s;uch &s;hort allow|ance, and no other Drink to tru&s;t to but &s;tin|king Water, did not know how to brook it well.</P>
<P>The Officers and Gentlemen Voluntiers, who had brought but little money with them (being in hopes that there was enough before them) were obliged to &s;ell their moveables to <HI>Jack Portuguee&s;e,</HI> &s;uch as Scarlet Coats, Clooks and Swords, wherewith they pur|chas'd
<PB N="48" REF="35">a little Wine for them&s;elves. The Se|nate was in the &s;ame ca&s;e, for they had no Ca&s;h in their Bank, and being under &s;uch ano|ther nece&s;&s;ity as <HI>David</HI> was when he eat the Shew-bread, made bold with the &s;everal Ships &s;tock-pur&s;es, wherein was only 100 <HI>l</HI> for each Ship, and 10 <HI>l</HI> for each Tender, in ca&s;e they &s;hould meet with any di&s;a&s;ter at' Sea and be oblig'd to be put into a Foreign Port. With this Money, and a few Pipe-&s;taves, they purchas'd 27 Pipes of Wine, and a &s;mall recruit of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions. But this would not have gone far, for if it had been &s;erv'd out but at a quarter of a pint a day to each man it would not have held out above &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>That you may ta&s;t a little of our Provi&s;i|ons as well as I, you mu&s;t know that our Stock-fi&s;h was the be&s;t, if there had been a pro|portion of Butter or Oyl to it. Our Beef was 3 fourths <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and the re&s;t <HI>Scotch,</HI> both alike &s;it for a long Voyage. There was about a fifth part of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;tall-&s;ed, the re&s;t gra&s;s Beef, and the whole about 18 months in &s;alt. As for our Bread, 27000 <HI>l</HI> weight of it was made up of damnified Wheat which was bought cheap, and the money of it is now in the pocket of a Director, who&s;e Chri&s;tian Name is <HI>Drummellier.</HI> This Bread was not &s;it for dogs to eat, but it was a mercy we had a good many <HI>Highlanders</HI> in our Legion, who were not u&s;ed to feed on much of God's Crea|tures that's hallowed. The Pork was indiffe|rent
<PB N="49" REF="35">good, but there being no great &s;tore of it aboard we re&s;erv'd it always for our <HI>Sun|days</HI> dinner. As for Chee&s;e, we had none, by rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, that only &s;erves for concoction, or to create an appetite.</P>
<P>Thus we march'd as the <HI>Scots</HI> Armies did in former days with their 40 days Provi&s;ions on their backs again&s;t their Enemies; whom if they did not meet before that term was ex|pir'd they di&s;pers'd and went home again. But their ca&s;e and ours differ'd in &s;ome e&s;&s;en|tials, the&s;e were never far from home, knew what to tru&s;t to, and if they happen'd to be di&s;appointed of the Enemies Plunder, they could make bold with their Neighbours Chickens while they were on the Road, and that never reckon'd Stealing: But we were &s;ent to the back of Gods elbow, where we could &s;ee nothing but Death, &s;tarving and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mines before our Eyes, and although our inclinations were never &s;o &s;trong to bor|row any of our Neighbours goods, yet our power was always deficient.</P>
<P>But now to proceed on our Voyage, and give you the remarkable Occurrances of it and of our <HI>Darien</HI> entertainment; you are to know that we left the <HI>Edinburgh Fyrth</HI> on <HI>July</HI> the 17th. 1698, and having fetch'd a turn round the <HI>Orkney's</HI> we arriv'd at <HI>Madera's</HI> about the la&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and &s;taid there 5 or 6 days, till we purchas'd the fore&s;aid 27 Pipes of Wine. Here the Council open'd their In|&s;tructions,
<PB N="50" REF="36">by which they were ordered to Steer to <HI>Crabb-I&s;land,</HI> and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of the Company and Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and leave a &s;mall deteachment there. This I&s;land lies to Leeward of <HI>St. a Cruz,</HI> a|bout 9 Leagues, to windward of <HI>Porto-Rico,</HI> about 5 Miles and 18 Leagues from <HI>St. Thomas</HI> a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> I&s;land. Having made the I&s;land of <HI>St. a Cruz,</HI> our Senate order'd the <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> and one of the Tenders into <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> to get &s;ome Pilates for the Main, and to return to us at <HI>Crabb-I&s;land.</HI> While the Council &s;at on this occa&s;ion, we drove to the <HI>Northward-mo&s;t</HI> end of <HI>St. a Cruz,</HI> and not being in too much ha&s;t to come to an Anchor at <HI>Crabb-I&s;land,</HI> we fetch'd a trip to Windward round <HI>St. a Cruz,</HI> which occa&s;ion'd the di&s;appoint|ment of our &s;ettlement; for our Mi&s;&s;ioners to <HI>St. Thomas</HI> having innocently &s;catter'd &s;ome words there of our <HI>Crabb</HI> de&s;ign, the Governour forthwith di&s;patch'd a Sloop with ten Men and an Officer to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of <HI>Denmark;</HI> &s;o that at our arrival in the Bay, or Road of <HI>Crabb-I&s;land,</HI> we could &s;ee a large Tent a&s;hore with the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Colours flying. Our Se|nate &s;ent a&s;hore to know the meaning of it, and were made &s;en&s;ible that they came too late. Next day the <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> and Tender ar|riv'd, having brought with them one <HI>Alli&s;on,</HI> who Commanded a Sloop in that Squadron of Privateers, who had landed at <HI>Golden-I&s;land,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="36">and march'd over the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> about 18 Years ago. We were glad of &s;uch a Pilot, for there was no Man in our Fleet that had ever been on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t. We left <HI>Crabb I&s;land</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> and having met with <HI>Southerly</HI> and <HI>We&s;terly</HI> winds for 3 Weeks or a Month together, it was the &s;econd of <HI>No|vember</HI> before we came to an Anchor on the <HI>Darien</HI> Coa&s;t. We lay becalm'd a Week be|tween <HI>Cartagena</HI> and <HI>Cape Tiburoon</HI> (which is the <HI>We&s;termo&s;t</HI> point of the Gulph of <HI>Darien</HI>) where for want of any Air, but what was Sulphurous, our Men fell down and died like rotten Sheep.</P>
<P>We came to an Anchor about 7 Leagues to the <HI>Northwe&s;t</HI> of <HI>Cape Tiburoon,</HI> and altho' we were clo&s;e by <HI>Golden I&s;land,</HI> yet neither our Pilate, nor any per&s;on el&s;e knew the Land, till the <HI>Indians</HI> inform'd us. The <HI>&V;ni|corn</HI> being the fir&s;t Ship that came to an An|chor &s;ent her Boat a&s;hore; where having left an ho&s;tage with &s;ome <HI>Indians,</HI> who had a Plantation there, two Canous with a few <HI>In|dians</HI> came on board the Ships. The Canou which came to the <HI>St. Andrew</HI> where I was had Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> on board, who was af|terwards the Companies and Collonies Land|lord: They were &s;ome hours aboard before we could make them under&s;tand us, altho a <HI>Jew</HI> (who was our Lingui&s;t) endeavour'd it with his <HI>Spani&s;h, Portugue&s;e, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> till once they were got drunk with our Punch
<PB N="52" REF="37">and <HI>Madera</HI> Wine, and then Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> with his Lieutenant &s;poke it as fa&s;t and much better than our <HI>Jew.</HI> Having got their load they were not able to go a&s;hore that night; and next day we weigh'd and came into the Bay within <HI>Golden I&s;land,</HI> which is about 4 or 5 Miles wide and deep. And having &s;ound|ed with our Boats along the &s;hore, we found a Lagoon on the <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide of this Bay, which runs up within the Land about two Miles and a half; this appearing to be a good Harbour for us, we went into it and Chri&s;t|ened it, by the name of <HI>Caledonia</HI> Harbour. The mouth or entry of this Harbour is a large Mile over, and &s;o &s;teep too on both &s;ides that a Ship may go &s;o near as to throw a Bisket-cake a&s;hore. One &s;ide of the Harbour to|wards the Sea is a va&s;t Mountain and Penin|&s;ula, being joyn'd to the Main at the bottom of the Harbour, by a neck of low Land, a|bout 3 or 400 Paces over. The extream point of this Penin&s;ula, which makes one &s;ide of the Harbours mouth, is a low and flat piece of Sandy ground, containing about 30 Acres, and divided from the Penin&s;ula by another neck of 180 Paces over from Sea to Sea. This was pitch'd upon as the &s;tronge&s;t Sanctuary in ca&s;e of attacks, as likewi&s;e for the convenience of a battery towards the Harbours mouth: We Chri&s;ten'd this piece of ground by the name <HI>New Edinburgh,</HI> and the Platform of 16 Guns which we made
<PB N="53" REF="37">there was call'd <HI>Fort St. Andrew.</HI> The neck of Land was cut through to let the Sea en|compa&s;s the New City and Fort, and part it from the Penin&s;ula, and within the Treneh a brea&s;t-work with a Parapet was rais'd, and a half ba&s;tion at each end. On the other &s;ide of the Trench the Trees were fell'd, and the ground clear'd for a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot round, to give us a fair pro&s;pect of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> in ca&s;e of an attack. This piece of ground was the <HI>Scotch</HI> Collony; as for the Penin&s;ula it &s;elf, it might have been fortify'd with &s;ome labour and pains, but not thinking it conve|nient to part &s;o few men to defend the&s;e two Po&s;ts, it was re&s;olv'd by the Council to &s;tick clo&s;e by this and fortify it to the be&s;tad-vantage. As for the oppo&s;ite point on the Main, which makes the other &s;ide of the entry into the Harbour, it is a high ridge of a Moun|tain which with a &s;harp or edg'd end butts into the Sea, and &s;o cro&s;ly contriv'd that it would puzzle all the Inginiers in <HI>Europe</HI> to plant a Gun on it that could do any Service. So that at be&s;t, this Harbour is only a &s;helter from bad weather, the Platform call'd <HI>Fort St. Andrew</HI> being of little u&s;e to defend it; the Ships in|deed by bringing a Spring on their Cables, and their Broad&s;ides to bear towards the mouth of the Harbour, might &s;erve for &s;o advantagious a Battery, as one Ship within the Harbour might be as good as two that came in to attack them, the nature of which &s;trength may ea&s;ily be comprehended by any Seafaring men.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="38">
<P>But to return to our Landlord and the other <HI>Indians;</HI> Captain <HI>Andreas</HI>'s Plantation was a|mong&s;t the Mountains, about 4 miles from our Harbour; the extent of his Government was from <HI>Carrit-bay</HI> about 8 or 9 miles on one &s;ide of us, and <HI>Golden I&s;land</HI> about 5 miles on the other &s;ide, &s;uch a portion of Land being the Laird&s;hip or Kingdom of the&s;e Captains whom the <HI>Buccaneers, Privateers</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Company would have to be Kings and Sovereign Princes. At our fir&s;t Landing, Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> came down and lookt on us, and &s;eem'd to be well enough &s;atisfy'd with his new Tenants (he thinking it in vain to appear otherwi&s;e, for if he had mu&s;ter'd his whole Clan to oppo&s;e us, 6 of our men with fire-arms were enough to conquer him) but what his &s;entiment was will appear by the &s;equel. After that Vi&s;it he did not come near us for 3 or 4 weeks; and during this time the mighty noi&s;e of our Force &s;pread|ing all along that Shore, and the hopes we gave them of re&s;toring them to their ancient Liberty and Greatne&s;s, there came <HI>Canous</HI> with <HI>Indians</HI> from all the neighbouring parts to view us: it was our intere&s;t to make them wel|come, &s;o that they came daily to us without any dread, and having &s;taid till we were weary of them, went home again with &s;ome little pre&s;ents of Beads, Looking-gla&s;&s;es, or Knives. About the &s;ame time Captain <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> came from the We&s;tward to us, with a <HI>Periaga</HI> full of <HI>Indians,</HI> to the number of 30, including Men, Women and Children, (for when they
<PB N="55" REF="38">travel they carry their whole Families with them) and having come within half a mile of our Ships they &s;et up a Flag of Truce, and lay on their Oars till our Pinnaces went out and a&s;&s;ur'd them that they &s;hould be &s;afe. This <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> is one of their greate&s;t Captains, and at pre&s;ent an Outlaw, or if you will, at war with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> having murder'd 10 of them at the I&s;le of <HI>Pines</HI> &s;ometime agoe: his Plantation and Government is about 50 miles to Leeward of the Collony, and about half way between and the <HI>Samballa</HI>'s I&s;lands. He was made very welcom, &s;taid 2 or 3 days, and told us that we were not &s;afe in Captain <HI>An|dreas</HI>'s Ground by rea&s;on he was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cap|tain and a very <HI>Spaniard</HI> in his heart, and al|though he &s;eem'd to be well enough &s;atisfy'd with our landing in his Ground, yet he was not to be tru&s;ted but came purely with a de&s;ign to &s;py us. Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> ab&s;enting him&s;elf &s;o long from the Collony added to the &s;ame &s;u&s;picion, and our Senatours being re&s;olv'd to know more of it, 3 of their number went on a Vi&s;it to his Plantation, and having enter'd his <HI>Wigwam</HI> (or Cage-like hou&s;e) he &s;at &s;till on his Seat without &s;aying one word to them, or &s;eeming to know that he ever had &s;een them before, although he was made heartily drunk at both the times he was on board. Mr. <HI>Pen|nycook</HI> and the others having met with this cold Entertainment from Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> (for they were not offer'd &s;o much as a Plan|tain or Callaba&s;h of Drink, which is the u&s;ual
<PB N="56" REF="39">Entertainment the <HI>Indians</HI> give to their Friends at their fir&s;t entry) came home again confirm'd of what <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> and the other <HI>In|dians</HI> had hitherto &s;aid. The next time Capt. <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> came he in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ame &s;tory, and would needs per&s;wade us to remove from that place and come nearer to him, where we needed not apprehend any betraying de|&s;ign from him by rea&s;on his killing of the&s;e 10 <HI>Spaniards</HI> at the I&s;le of <HI>Pines,</HI> and taking that <HI>Periaga</HI> with a bra&s;s <HI>Pitterara</HI> could never be forgiven by them. Our Council met on this occa&s;ion, where it was order'd that <HI>Pen|nycook, Montgomery, Macay</HI> and <HI>Pinparton</HI> Coun&s;ellors, with <HI>Robert Drummond</HI> Com|mander of the <HI>Caledonia</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>Ambro|&s;io</HI>'s, with the Long-boats and Pinnaces mann'd with 70 Fire-arms, and on their way to &s;ound all the Harbours along the Coa&s;t. I was de|&s;ir'd by the&s;e Gentlemen to go with them, and having &s;topt the fir&s;t Night at the I&s;le of <HI>Pines,</HI> 6 Leagues to Leeward of the Collony, where Captain <HI>Long</HI> was riding in His Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Rupert Prize,</HI> we lodg'd that Night on Board with him. The next day we proceed|ed on our Expedition &s;ounding the Coa&s;t, where we &s;ound &s;ome good Harbours that were able to contain all the Navy of <HI>England,</HI> but they could not be fortify'd &s;o as to hinder the Enemy from coming in. When we ar|civ'd at <HI>Ambro&s;io's</HI> little River or Brook we lan|ded, and were Piloted by his Son Captain <HI>Pedro</HI> to the Plantation, which is about a
<PB N="57" REF="39">league from the Sea, and is &s;o cunning and ob&s;cure, that without a Guide it is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to find the way to it. We cro&s;t one River eleven times, wading always up to the middle, and I believe we could have gone a nearer way if they would, but they do this de&s;ignedly, that the Path or Road may not be found out by the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Being arriv'd at the Plantation, Captain <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> came out of his Wigwam about 30 Paces and welcom'd us, he had a white Cotton Frock on fring'd at the bottom, and his Court or Clann behind him (who were all mu|&s;ter'd on this occa&s;ion) to the number of thirty men be&s;ides Women and Children; they were in &s;uch Frocks as <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI>'s, and had &s;hort Lances in their hands: He carry'd us into his Wigwam, and his Wives gave every one of us a Plantain and Callaba&s;h of their drink (which is made of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and like unboil'd Flummery) this being all the Food we got till the next day at noon we came down to our Boats, except a di&s;h of mine'd Meat of Wild Hogg, wherein was about two pound of Meat, which &s;erv'd to give us a ta&s;t of their fine&s;t Cheer. We hung in Hammocks that Night in <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI>'s Wigwam a|mong&s;t his and his Son <HI>Pedro</HI>'s Wives, and our men lay without round a large Fire that was made for them. Next morning <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> went out betimes with 3 or 4 of his men to hunt for us, but there be|ing no appearance of his return at noon, and our Belliers crying Cupboard, we did not &s;tay to bid him fare well; and his Son Captain <HI>Pedro</HI> having re-con|ducted us to the Sea &s;ide, de&s;ir'd the Lingui&s;t to tell Captain <HI>Pennycook,</HI> that his Father and he expected &s;ome Pre&s;ent for that Entertainment. We had brought nothing with us at that time, &s;o told him, that the next time his Father came to the Collony the Council would thank him, and give him &s;ome|thing, which afterwards was two pieces of <HI>Scotch</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="40">Cloth, two Fire-locks, and &s;ome Pouder, with a few Shot, wherewith he was mightily pleas'd.</P>
<P>Having return'd to the Collony, and a Report of the Expedition being made in Council, and the Port where we were reckon'd the mo&s;t &s;ecure, it was re&s;olv'd to remain there, di&s;patch the Fortifica|tion with all expedition, and make the be&s;t Bargain with <HI>Andreas</HI> we could. On the la&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> being St. <HI>Andrew's,</HI> day, it was manag'd &s;o (but how I cannot re&s;olve you) that Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> came a|board the St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> where was a Fe&s;tival on the account of the Day, and he being ask'd by the Lin|gui&s;t, why he was &s;o uncivil to the Councellours when they came to vi&s;it him in his Plantation, he an&s;wer'd, That he meant no harm, and that they mu&s;t impute it to his Ignorance of the <HI>European</HI> Cu&s;toms (altho' this Tale could not come well from one that was bred among the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) and not to his want of good-will. He was de&s;ir'd to &s;it down and &s;hare with them, the Lingui&s;t telling him the occa&s;ion of that Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>After Dinner, the great Bowl of Punch being &s;et on the Table (the &s;ight of which was plea&s;ant e|nough to <HI>Andreas</HI>) the Council was re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h the thing home, and told him what <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> and the other <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aid of him; to which he reply'd almo&s;t <HI>verbatim,</HI> as follows, That he could not de|ny but that he was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, and had been &s;o a long time; that the rea&s;on of his &s;hewing the Collony &s;o little Countenance was, by rea&s;on &s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Hi&s;tory Buchaneers.</NOTE> 16 or 17 years pa&s;t, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> landed in that very Ground, being 12 or 13 hundred in number, and made them believe they were come to free them from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Yoke, and re&s;tore them to their own Country; his Friends and Relations join'd and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them at the taking of <HI>Sancta Maria</HI> and o|ther Towns on the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and likewi&s;e &s;erv'd on
<PB N="59" REF="40">board their Ships with them in their <HI>South Sea</HI> Expe|ditions, till at two years end they found, that all their de&s;ign was on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plunder, and having got that, le&s;t them expos'd to the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who have cut off mo&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> there|abouts, and that for &s;everal Years they were oblig'd to live ob&s;curely in the Mountains; as for him&s;elf and Friends, they were oblig'd to accept of the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>'s Terms; but at the &s;ame time, if he thought that the Collony were &s;incere, and that their Nati|on could protect him and this Kindred, he was rea|dy to break with the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and join with them. Few words more were made of it, the Council ac|cepted of his pro&s;er, and promis'd great things e|nough for the Nation, and the Secretary was or|der'd immediately to make out a Commi&s;&s;ion for <HI>Andreas.</HI> It was made on Parchment with the Col|lonies Seal and a fine Ribband affixt to it, the tenor whereof run thus. Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> having de&s;ir'd Protection from the Collony for him&s;elf and the o|ther <HI>Indians</HI> under him, the Council does hereby take him and them into their Protection, and ap|points the fore&s;aid <HI>Andreas</HI> to be one of their <HI>Scots</HI> Collonies Captains, to command all the <HI>Indians</HI> that's already in his Ground, and to fight again&s;t and de|&s;troy the Enemies of the Collony of what Nation &s;oever. This Commi&s;&s;ion was wrote in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and read to him by the <HI>Jew</HI> in <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> and for the more &s;olemnity of the thing, the Council gave him one of the Long-Boats Jacks to wear in his <HI>Canou,</HI> a Fuzee, and a pair of Pi&s;tols, and a Basket-hilted Sword, and fir'd 21 Guns at his Inauguration. In the Evening Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> went a&s;hore with his Flag &s;lying and the other en&s;igns of his Honour, ex|cept The Commi&s;&s;ion, which I found the day follow|ing cram'd into a Locker of the Round-hou&s;e where empty Bottles lay.

The o|ther is, that there was no care taken while he was aboard to bleed him, or give him any thing inward|ly to keep the Blood fluid and from &s;ettling on the bruiz'd parts, but laid him up till next Day his Wife and Relations carry'd him a-&s;hore double.</P>

<P>This is the ground of the Companies title to the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien,</HI> and that was the Bloody Fight wherein &s;o many hun|dreds of <HI>Spaniards</HI> were kill'd and taken Pri&s;oners. Our Men being reduc'd to the foremention'd &s;hort Allowance, and wrought every day from Sun to Sun in felling of Trees, and Fortifying them&s;elves, and feeing but little appearance of the Riches they were told of, began to be very faint-hearted.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e general murmur|ings, the Council could not augment the Allowance, without runing the hazard of &s;tarving a Month or two &s;ooner, for there's no kind of Food to be had in that Mountainous &amp; Woody Country, &s;ave Plantains, Bonnano's

They were oblig'd to a certain Animal call'd a Sojour, which is a &s;mall Land Crab, that is hous'd in a &s;hell like that of a Wilk; The&s;e Sojours were very plentiful at our fir&s;t Landing, but they &s;oon fail'd; and then our Men eat the in|ner rind of the bark of great Iree, which was not unplea&s;ant to the ta&s;t, but it be|ing of no nouri&s;hment, and thought to be unwhole&s;ome, they were di&s;charged to eat of it. I doubt not but there's plenty of Fi&s;h on that Coa&s;t, but our Company fur|ni&s;hing us only with a &s;mall.

We made a &s;hift to make a couple of Turtle Nets out of the &s;tore of Lines or &s;mall Cord we had aboard, but then we had not a Ve&s;&s;el that was fit to go a Turtling, till after &s;ome
<PB N="148" REF="44">time, two of the <HI>Jamaico</HI> Sloops who had brought and &s;old their Cargo of Provi&s;ions to the Collony were hir'd by them to Tur|tle for them: The&s;e Sloops &s;taid about a month in their Service, till they had got &s;o many Turtle for them as by contract came to a 100 and odd Pounds, and finding that there was neither Money nor Money's worth to be had in the Collony, they broke off with them, and with much a do could get &s;o much Money as to &s;atisfie them for their Service. They had &s;ome dependance on the wreck of a French Ship which wasca&s;t away coming out of the Harbour the day before <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> &s;he having near 40000 <HI>l</HI> in Doubloons and Dollars on board, which &s;he had got by trading on the Spani&s;h Coa&s;t, but I am told by &s;ome per&s;ons who are come home &s;ince I came, that they could not recover any thing of it, by rea&s;on of the continual &s;well that beats on that &s;hore. Here (in Parenthe&s;i) I was Shipwrack:d, had my Servant drow'd, and lo&s;t the few Goods I had with Bag and Baggage, and if it had not been for the little Money which I &s;a|ved I had not found the way home as yet: As for the Gold and Riches of that Coun|try, I heard enough but &s;aw little of it; I pre&s;ume if there were &s;uch &s;tore, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> would not have left it &s;o expos'd.
<PB N="149" REF="44">The&s;e Kings or Captains who came down to us might bring perhaps half an Ounce or an Ounce at a time with them and &s;ell it for Powder and Shot, and at fir&s;t for a &s;peckled Shirt, but there came &s;o little of this Com|modity among&s;t us that it would be long time before a Man could load his Pocket with it, much le&s;s a Dutch built Ship.

<P>I left the Collony the 27th of <HI>December,</HI> at the &s;ame allowance as we were reduc'd to in <HI>July,</HI> when we left <HI>Scotland;</HI> only there was an allowance of <HI>Madera</HI> Wine after our Landing, to wit, an Engli&s;h Quart to a Me&s;s (being 5 Men) once a Week: Two Quarts to each Captain once a Week, of which the&s;e Gentlemen made only one want, and the Night they got their Allow|ance, they went as merry to Bed as if they had been in their Winter Quarters at <HI>Ghent</HI> or <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> altho they were ablig'd to drink fair Water for a Week afterwards: As for the Subalterns, when I came off, they were not allow'd one Spoonful.</P>

<P>Thus you &s;ee how a 1050 Men were &s;ent by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company on a blind Project, of getting Riches for them with five or &s;ix months Allowance at mo&s;t, no Credit, and a ridiculous Cargo, neglected by them, and expos'd to Famine Death and the Spani&s;h Mines. How the Compa|ny will &s;hake this mi&s;cariage from off them|&s;elves I cannot &s;ee: However, I will give you a &s;ample of what they will be ready to offer in their own vindication.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Their being baulkt of their fo|reign Sub&s;criptions made them lo&s;e Time and Money, whereby they could not &s;end out &s;uch a number of Men and quantity of Provi&s;ions as the Project would have requi|red. But who is to blame for this, why &s;hould they tru&s;t to another Man's Pur&s;e till &s;uch time they are &s;ure of it? Why did they prodigally throw away 50000 <HI>l</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hambrough</HI> (purely to make a blu&s;ter there) when they could have bought 3 Second-hand-Ships as fit for their Project, for the third of the Money? And &s;ince their de&s;ign was to &s;ettle a Collony and Forts on the North and South Seas, why did not they apply them&s;elves rightly to it? That which might have been hone&s;t|ly &s;av'd out of this 50000 <HI>l</HI> might have carried over above 2000 Men with 12 months
<PB N="151" REF="45">Provi&s;ions of every Specie at good allow|ance. I have made this appear in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ome time ago, and &s;ince to &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men in the Company.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on they will be apt to offer is this, the Ships were Mann'd, the Sea-men and Land-men Li&s;ted and on board, no Provi&s;ions to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> while more were providing abroad, the&s;e aboard &s;till were expending; be&s;ides, there was no Money in the Ca&s;h-room, nor any more to be had from the Sub&s;cribers, till once the Ships were &s;ail'd, many being &s;o &s;ick of the Project, that they doubted whether they &s;hould ever pa&s;s the Ba&s;s. If this &s;hould be allow'd to pa&s;s for Current it may rea&s;ona|bly be ask'd whether five or &s;ix Months Provi&s;ions &s;hould have la&s;ted to this time. If ever they expected to hear any more of their Ships, ought they not to have call'd in more Money on our departure, and provi|ded Provi&s;ions in&s;tantly, and had Ships with us by <HI>Christmas,</HI> or <HI>January</HI> at farthe&s;t; whereas none &s;ail'd from <HI>Leith</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> which was near two Months after they re|ceiv'd the Collonies Packet. If they pre|tended to be ignorant of our nece&s;&s;ity before this Packet came, they had no excu&s;e after|wards, they knew our want, as like wife that they had not &s;ent a Groats-worth of
<PB N="152" REF="46">Credit with us to any part of the World, altho now when its too late, they have made a fa&s;hion of doing it in <HI>New|England.</HI></P>
<P>The third Rea&s;on they will make great u&s;e of is this, that at the &s;etling of <HI>Barba|does,</HI> and &s;everal other <HI>We&s;t-india</HI> I&s;lands, as likewi&s;e the <HI>American</HI> &s;ettlements on the Main, the People met with a great many hard&s;hips, and the like are to be expected at the beginning of all &s;uch Settlements. To this I an&s;wer, that at &s;uch Settlements the Undertakers and Planters know what they are going about, and what to tru&s;t to, which is no ways parallel with the Ca&s;e of the Company, for tho&s;e being on an hone&s;t de&s;ign had no more in their view than the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, and the Product of the Earth, and what they reap'd thereby was for their own u&s;e. On the other hand the Gentlemen who went in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Compa|nies Service, were not born to Work, nor did they de&s;ign it when they went from their Fathers Hou&s;es, and this the Company knew full as well as they.</P>
<P>A fourth rea&s;on they will offer is this, that they &s;ent a Cargo with us, which might have purchas'd Provi&s;ions had it not been for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> prohibition. To this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word">, that the Company having &s;ent
<PB N="153" REF="46">us on &s;o dark an Errand, (where they mu&s;t needs be a&s;&s;ur'd, that not only <HI>Spain,</HI> but the other Trading Nations would be in our top) &s;hould not have tru&s;ted to that, unle&s;s they contriv'd it de&s;ignedly to pick a quarrel with tho&s;e Nations who&s;e inte|re&s;t it was to refu&s;e us Provi&s;ions or Ne|ce&s;&s;aries to &s;upport our Collony. As for the Cargo it &s;elf, I refer my felf to the particulars, and let any Merchant be Judge, whether it was fitted for &s;ale, e&s;pecially in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The 1500 Fuzzes were the be&s;t of the Cargo, but they could not be parted with; the Linnen was the next, but I have been a&s;&s;ur'd by Merchants on <HI>Port-royal,</HI> that 500 <HI>l</HI> worth of <HI>Scorch</HI> cloath makes the Commodity a drug there at a|ny time. Be&s;ides, altho' we had not been &s;ent on a dark de&s;ign, yet we cou'd not ex|pect to Trade with <HI>Jamaico;</HI> our Cloath and other Goods are &s;eizable there, either in our Bottoms, or in their. Sloops. if the <HI>Jamaico</HI> Men &s;hould truck Provi&s;ions with us, they cannot carry our goods home with them, neither can they expect to Trade with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> on the account of our Settlement. I know very well that the fir&s;t Sloop which brought Provi&s;ions to us, &s;old them at what rate they pleas'd, and had our <HI>Scotch</HI> Cloath in truck at the prime co&s;t, yet they dur&s;t
<PB N="154" REF="47">not carry it to <HI>Jamaico,</HI> nor venture to Trade with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but were oblig'd to leave it behind with Captain <HI>Alli&s;on,</HI> the old Buccaneer, to whom the Sloop was con&s;ign'd. Lur &s;till this rea&s;on of the prohi|bition will not hold Water, for if there had been Money or market Goods in the Collony. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> prohibition could not have kept Provi&s;ions from us. The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> I|&s;lands were not confin'd by this Prohibi|tion; and I dare &s;ay there are &s;o many good Chri&s;tians at <HI>Curra&s;&s;a,</HI> that if <HI>Redp.</HI> and B's &s;tory of the Collonies bars of Silver had been true, they would &s;oon have made Pro|vi&s;ions a drug in <HI>Caledonia.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I can't think that the Prohibi|tion had any influence on tho&s;e four Sloops who went from <HI>Jamaico</HI> to the Collony laden with Provi&s;ions of all kinds, altho' two of them return'd without breaking bulk, I am rather apt to believe it was for want of tho&s;e Silver bars and gold du&s;t, which in the Au|tum &s;hakes off the Trees there.</P>
<P>As to the prohibition in &s;elf, whereon the Author of the defence &s;tumbles &s;o oft, and would gladly found the Ba&s;is of his quar|ral. 'Tis believ'd that his Maje&s;ty knew nothing of the Collonies Settlenient at <HI>Da|rien,</HI> but what he had at &s;econd hand from <HI>R&mdash;th</HI>'s Prints, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor
<PB N="155" REF="47">told him from his Ma&s;ter, that &s;ome of his Maje&s;ty's <HI>Scotch</HI> Subjects had invaded the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions, in his Province of <HI>Darien,</HI> which he look'd upon to be con|trary to the Treaty of Peace. If his Maje|&s;ty &s;topt the <HI>Spaniards</HI> mouth for the pre&s;ent, till he inquired into the matter, and forbid his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to have any Communication with the&s;e Peo|ple in <HI>Darien,</HI> till &s;uch time as the Title were concerted, he did no more than what was con&s;onant with the Con&s;titutions and E&s;labli&s;hment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;lands, altho' there had been no <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Compla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">nt.

And if the King &s;orb.d the&s;e to &s;upply the <HI>Scotch</HI> Collony, he did not prohibit the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company, not <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation to &s;end them what Provisions, or other nece&s;iaries they thought nt. If the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company took mo&s;t care to &s;end out Buccaneers Pieces, with great quantities of Powder and Shot, and tru&s;ted to what Men they could decoy from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> I&s;lands, the defign was neither fair, nor hone&s;t, and it may rea&s;onably be believ'd, that both the&s;e Nations would have taken mea&s;ures
<PB N="156" REF="48">to bring them back again after they went. And if his Maje&s;ty takes care that his Plan|tations in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> &s;hall not be re|duc'd to Forre&s;ts, he can't be blam'd, con|&s;idering the va&s;t Riches they &s;end home to <HI>England</HI> yearly, and the Cu&s;toms which come into his Coffers, when on the other hand, all that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company can make by &s;uch depopulations, will not put one Peny in his Pocket the&s;e &s;eventeen years at &s;oone&s;t, worth the product of &s;eventeen Hog&s;heads of Tobaccco.</P>
<P>Laying a&s;ide the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Complaint and admit the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company to have a legal Title to their Settlement, was it not rea|&s;onable that the Government of <HI>England,</HI> having met with the clande&s;tine Declara|rations, which the <HI>Scotch</HI> Collony had &s;pread all over the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> inviting them over to <HI>Darien,</HI> &amp;c. Should take &s;ui|table mea&s;ures to prevent the ill con&s;equen|ces of the &s;ame, and retain their own Sub|jects. The Declarations are notorious, and mu&s;t be penn'd by &s;ome Body belonging to the Company or Collony, and I pre&s;ume the oppo&s;ite Proclamation or Prohibition was penn'd by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who had &s;ome Intere&s;t in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations. 'Tis very well known that when Captain <HI>Pin|carton</HI> met with the misfortue of being ob|lig'd
<PB N="157" REF="48">to run his Ve&s;&s;el a&s;hore under the Guns of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> his Chief Errand was to <HI>Barhadoes,</HI> and there to make u&s;e of the 48 hours (that's allow'd to foreigners to Wood and Water) in doing bu&s;ine&s;s for the Collony, and leaving Declarations to be &s;pread over that I&s;land; and &s;o from thence to other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> I&s;lands, making u&s;e of the &s;ame Pretence of wanting Wood and Water. The&s;e &s;i|ni&s;ter dealings are not &s;uffered in the Collony of any Nation, and if the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Governments take care to prevent &s;uch de&s;igns, I cannot &s;ee how they can be blaim'd: 'Tis very well known that tho&s;e Declarations were &s;o kindly entertain'd all over the <HI>We&s;tin|dies,</HI> that what with the Umbrary u&s;e that was made of King <HI>William</HI>'s name, and the hopes of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Spoil, mo&s;t Men who were not Indu'd with Real or Per|&s;onal E&s;tate, were making ready to go over to <HI>Darien:</HI> Nay the unthinking &s;ort of People about the City of <HI>London,</HI> on the Coin'd Rhodomantado News, where|with the non-authoriz'd Prints were dai|ly &s;tuft, were pleas'd and big with the Project, looking no farther into in than <HI>Jacks Gold,</HI> which they natively believe every body has a right to; when at the &s;ame time

<P>Being afflicted with a <HI>Mallady imagi|naire</HI> for &s;ome Months before I came off: I purchas'd my Liberty of the Collony with difficulty enough: About the &s;ame time the Coun&s;el having re&s;olv'd to &s;end home one of their Tenders with a Pack|et to the Company, and a &s;ample of the &s;trange Woods that grow in the Collonies Garden, I thought to have got my Pa&s;|&s;age in her, but was di&s;appointed by a State Rea&s;on, which was thus, Major <HI>Cunningham</HI> was the chief In&s;trument in|contriving and forwarding the Expre&s;s, and having brought his marks to bear,

<P>We left the Collony the 27th. of <HI>De|cember,</HI> arriv'd in <HI>Jamaico</HI> a fortnight af|terward, and in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> the 18th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, where the Major and I parted, he going for <HI>Scotland</HI> and I for <HI>London:</HI> At our parting he would oblidge me to write nothing to <HI>Scotland</HI> in prejudice of the <HI>Darien</HI> Project, and I promi&s;ed him that he &s;hould have &s;uch liberty in telling his own Story there, that for the &s;pace of two Months I &s;hould not write concerning it, Directly or Indirectly, which promi&s;e I kept Religiou&s;ly, although as it has hap|pen'd my &s;ilence has not been of much &s;ervice to the Company.</P>

He argued in favour of the Company, in &s;ome Law Terms, wherein I pretend to no Judgment, far|ther than my Rea&s;on will fathom; and urg'd that by the Civil-Law no Title to any Country, can be vallid unle&s;s it be <HI>de Facto</HI> as well as <HI>Jure,</HI> and tho&s;e he di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd thus, all the <HI>de june</HI> right which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had to <HI>Darien</HI> was the Pope's Donation, which is never regarded a|mong&s;t Prote&s;tant Princes; That the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> had no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>de facto</HI> of that Coun|try
<PB N="163" REF="54">unle&s;s he liv'd on the Spot, or had his Cattle running there.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer'd, that if the <HI>Scots</HI> had been in <HI>Darien</HI> as &s;oon as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, the Companies Donation might have been as valid as the Pope's, but as the&s;e have been ma&s;ters of that Country by a pro|&s;cription of years, and their Title there|to never hitherto contraverted by any Prince or State till now by the Company. I could not &s;ee how at that rate any Collony or Plantation in the U|niver&s;e can be &s;afe. The <HI>Spaniaras</HI> mu&s;t either be confin'd within their wall'd Towns, and the reach of their Guns, or they mu&s;t be allowed the u&s;ual extent round them, as all other Collonies in <HI>America</HI> have. The Company might with the &s;ame Ju&s;tice Land on the North-&s;ide of <HI>Jamaico,</HI> where, for 20 Leagues running there's neither <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man nor Bea&s;t to be &s;een, altho' there are as many, if not more, Wild Negroes in the Mountains of <HI>Jamaico,</HI> who have de&s;ert|ed their Ma&s;ters than <HI>Indians,</HI> on thrice &s;o much ground of the I&s;thmus of <HI>Da|rien.</HI> By the &s;ame Title the Company might have &s;eated them&s;elves on the I|&s;land of <HI>Tobaga</HI> (where there's never a
<PB N="164" REF="55">Man) without asking the D. of <HI>Courland</HI>'s leave. On the other hand, the Compa|ny has &s;ettled their Collony in the very Bo&s;om and Centre of the three chie&s; Cities of the <HI>Spani&s;h-Indies,</HI> to wit, <HI>Car|thagena, Portobello,</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> the fir&s;t being about 45 Leagues, and the other two not above 30 di&s;tant from the Collony, be&s;ides &s;everal &s;maller Towns and Gar|ri&s;ons which are much nearer, <HI>viz, Sancta Maria, Tubaconti, &amp;c.</HI> Nay the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are at work in their Mines within 12 Leagues of Fort St. <HI>Andrew.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>de facto</HI> right, 'tis evident that the&s;e Captains who are over the Indian Clanns, have <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> names to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the Vulgar, &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> ge|nerally, their Wives go valed and cover'd after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women go, altho their Men go naked: Be&s;ides, one Paragraph of the Collonies Journal makes this very Spot of Ground where they are &s;ettled, to be the Propriety of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> by their acknowledging Captain <HI>Andreas</HI> to have been a Spani&s;h Captain. As for the defences which <HI>Batt. Sharp</HI> adduced on his Tryal of the Indian Emperor (there having been no &s;uch per|&s;on on the I&s;thumes of <HI>Darien</HI> the&s;e hun|dred years) and <HI>King Golden Cap,</HI> and
<PB N="165" REF="55">the forg'd Commi&s;&s;ion he produc'd from that Emperor, it was all trick: Neither was there much pains taken to hang him, or di&s;prove the Forgery. The Privateers indeed gave the title of King Golden Cap to the Indian Captains Son, who com|manded the&s;e Indians near <HI>Golden I&s;land,</HI> and he was this <HI>Andreas</HI> his fir&s;t Cou&s;in, but kill'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> after the Privateers left the I&s;thmus, as tho&s;e may now be who entertained the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;o friendly. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> admitting &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Troops into their Country does not take away the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Title and Right to that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Title is likewi&s;e confirm|ed by the Conce&s;&s;ion of all Princes, and Treaties of Peace, whereby the <HI>Spaniard</HI> does not only cut off the People of all Nations whom he finds cutting Logwood in the Bay of <HI>Campechy</HI> (a great many Leagues di&s;tant from any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Town) but keeps the <HI>Barlevento</HI> Fleet, and an <HI>Armadilla</HI> always ranging along that Coa&s;t, and makes prize of all Foreigners he finds trading on his Coa&s;t, without his Commi&s;&s;ion; If they have &s;o much as a &s;tick of Logwood, or three pieces of Eight aboard: Which if hed did not act Legally, to be &s;ure the Soveraign heads
<PB N="167" REF="56">of tho&s;e Subjects, would long e're now have demanded &s;atisfaction or made re|pri&s;al.</P>
<P>This was the Sub&s;tance of what I of|fer'd to Sir <HI>J. S.</HI> and what u&s;e he made of it, I never inquir'd after, as for that part of the Champions defence de&s;crib|ing the I&s;thumes of <HI>Darien,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you that it is calculated in all the mat|terial pa&s;&s;ages of it for a <HI>Scotch</HI> Meridian, as the <HI>Darien</HI> News were for &s;ix Months by the Companies Agents here in Town, who knew that what was Printed here and &s;ent to <HI>Scotland</HI> was far better be|liev'd than the <HI>Apocrypha.</HI> The <HI>Eden|brugh.</HI> News-monger was never wanting on his part, for he &s;till had &s;omething new from St. <HI>Germains</HI> to frighten us with the Cabals there, and private meetings between, the late King <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Lovis,</HI> but however nece&s;&s;any &s;uch hob-goblin &s;tories might been an inchanted Country, yet they never went down within the found of <HI>Bow-bel.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Champions endeavouring to prove the <HI>Scots</HI> intere&s;t by a &s;eparati|on, I will excu&s;e my &s;elf from medling with that part of the Subject, knowing at the &s;ame time that the Wi&s;emen of that Country know the benefit of that Union
<PB N="168" REF="56">better than this Author, or &s;ome more, who make u&s;e of the Machin of the Col|lony to &s;et the two Nations together by the ears, the better to advance their own private Ends.

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>THE ju&s;t Horrour that all hone&s;t men conceiv'd at the har&s;h and unneighbourly Treatment of the Scots Colony at <HI>Darien,</HI> laid the Gentle|men who have been mo&s;t active again&s;t it, under a nece&s;&s;ity of blackening the Reputation of tho&s;e concern'd in that Settlement. This they thought nece&s;&s;a|ry, in order to prevent any enquiry, that perhaps might be made: Why a Neighbouring Nation united to the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> by Situation, Government, Intere&s;t, Religion, Af|fection, and con&s;tant Inter-marriages, &s;hould be provok'd and trampl'd upon in &s;uch a manner, contrary to their own Laws and Original Con&s;titution, and which may pave the way in time for Treating our Neighbours in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>To prevent any &s;uch Enquiry, tho&s;e
<PB REF="59">Gentlemen that have been pleas'd to &s;ig|nalize them&s;elves as much by their ha|tred to the Scoti&s;h Nation, as the latter have &s;ignalized their Valour and Affecti|on, for our common Liberty and Religi|on, have been at pains and expence to &s;ave the Libeller <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> from the Gallows, by putting a &s;top to his Trial, and filling his Pockets with Money, on condition that he would be&s;patter the Reputation of the Scots Colony and their Ma&s;ters. The Crime is indeed unnatural for a man to turn Renegado and a Traitor to his Country; none but a Mon&s;ter like <HI>H</HI>&mdash; the Surgeon could have entertain'd &s;uch a Thought: He &s;old his God in the La&s;t Reign, by turning Papi&s;t, and therefore 'tis no great Wonder he &s;hould &s;ell his Country in this, and &s;olemnly renounce his going Northward for ever, provided he might he &s;ecur'd again&s;t going We&s;t|ward for once.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e of the Doughty Evidence, that the Faction have produced again&s;t the Scots Colony; we leave it to the World to judg what credit ought to
<PB REF="59">be given to his Te&s;timony, &s;ince it ap|pears that he harh giv'n it in to &s;ave his Life, to gain Money, and to give vent to his Malice. The latter he owns in the beginning of his Book, and repeats it a|gain <HI>p.</HI> 161. where he &s;ays he took this way to right him&s;elf, becau&s;e of the Scots here in Town being on his Top, and of &s;ome other har&s;h u&s;age which he receiv'd at the hands of the Scots Company.</P>
<P>The very manner of giving in his Evidence lays him open to the La&s;h of the Engli&s;h Law; and it is to be pre|&s;um'd that his train of Bla&s;phemies, and con&s;tant ridiculing the Text, would have been taken notice of e're now by a certain Court at the We&s;t end of <HI>Paul's,</HI> but that he is protected by &s;ome Gentlemen be|longing to a Court at the We&s;t end of the Town.</P>
<P>His invenom'd malice is demon&s;tra|ble, by the &s;port he makes to him&s;elf throughout his Libel at the Calamities and Mi&s;ery of his Fellow-Creatures and Countrymen; &s;o that never did any man more exactly fill up the Character
<PB REF="60">of a Renegado than him&s;elf: for as tho&s;e Mi&s;creants &s;tab an Image of our Saviour to the Heart, as a proof of having ab&s;o|lutely denied him; <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> hath in the &s;ame manner done all he could to &s;tab the Re|putation of his native Country, as a cer|tain evidence of his being turn'd a Mon|&s;ter in Nature; for which even they that imploy him mu&s;t needs abhor him, ex|cept they love to &s;ee the Image of their own Crimes in his Lovely Features.</P>
<P>We have not enter'd upon the detail of his malicious Lies with which he hath &s;tuff'd his Book, but have only pointed at the chief of them which are &s;o very noto|rious, as may well put his Suborners to the Blu&s;h, that they &s;hould not have ei|ther taught him his Le&s;&s;on better, or have &s;een he had conn'd it more exactly; for they are &s;uch gro&s;s Contradictions either to common Sen&s;e or to what he him&s;elf has advanc'd in his Libel, that none but one who had &s;wallow'd Tran&s;ub&s;tanti|ation could be guilty of the like.</P>
<P>It's needle&s;s to enlarge upon his Cha|racter, &s;ince it's impo&s;&s;ible to conceive
<PB REF="60">a wor&s;e Idea of him than all Men of Sen&s;e will immediately form to them|&s;elves, when they know he is a Traitor to his Country.</P>
<P>He was was formerly a Surgeon in the Fleet, and made &s;ome Intere&s;t among&s;t the Officers, by Female Mediation, which was allow'd him by his la&s;t Religion (for his Book &s;hews that now he has none.) Hence it is, that he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;o readily in the Dialect of his Office, and talks of <HI>Bullying</HI> Kings in his Dedication, to &s;hew us that he was acquain|ted with B-dy-hou&s;e Rhetorick, and they that know his Friends in <HI>Little&mdash;B&mdash;n,</HI> &s;ay he has convey'd his Libel to the World through a very proper Channel.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was a Surgeon in the Fleet, his ill Nature having condemn'd him to perpetual Broyls, he had the Impudence to draw upon his Captain a&s;hore, who wounded him &s;o as 'twas thought might have put a period to his Infamous Life, upon which his Captain was Confin'd, but the Wound not being Mortal, the Gentleman was &s;et at Liberty, and retur|ning on Board, a Council of War was held, by which <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> was like to have had an Exit more an&s;werable to his de&s;ert, at the Yard-Arm; but that one of our Country-men who Commanded in the Place, &s;av'd him out of Pity, and whil&s;t he was &s;culking at <HI>London</HI> to avoid this Pro&s;ecution; others of them out of
<PB REF="61">Compa&s;&s;ion hir'd him to go along with their Fleet, for which he hath made his Country &s;uch a Grateful Reward, as hath verify'd the Proverb, <HI>That &s;ave a R&mdash;gue from the Gallows he &s;hall be the fir&s;t that will cut your Throat.</HI> We leave his Suborners to think on't.</P>
<P>His Captain being thus di&s;appointed of having Ju&s;tice executed, was forc'd to con|tent him&s;elf with <HI>Pricking him Run,</HI> that he might not have any claim to his Wages; but &s;ince his return from <HI>Darien,</HI> and engaging in the Honourable &s;ervice of Reviling and Belying his Country, his Suborners out of their innate Bounty and Gratitude, have got him deliver'd from all farther Pro&s;ecution, entitled him to his Wages, and given him the opportunity to value him&s;elf upon his Core&s;pondence at the Court end of the Town, &s;o that now he thinks him&s;elf &s;ure of a Patent for Life, and that he &s;hall never be oblig'd to go up <HI>Holborn</HI>-Hill except his important occa&s;ions call him now and then that way, to enable him to pay his pre&s;ent Debts, when &s;ome of his Brethren, pa&s;s that Road to pay their la&s;t.</P>
<P>It had been ea&s;ie for us to have given &s;uch a Hi&s;tory of his Life as would have put his Suborners to the blu&s;h, but we re&s;erve that to make u&s;e of as we &s;hall &s;ee occa&s;ion; what's &s;aid is enough to let them know how much they are to tru&s;t to his Evidence, if they think fit to make further u&s;e of him, either by Li|belling his Country, or accu&s;ing any of tho&s;e great Families he threatens in his Dedication.</P>

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO The Cau&s;es of the Mi&s;cariage of the <HI>Scots</HI> Colony at <HI>Darien.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE main de&s;ign of <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Sub|orners, is to charge the Mi&s;carriage of the <HI>Scots</HI> Colony upon their own Country, to clear &s;ome Gentlemen that perhaps may be found within the Verge of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> from having any hand in it, and to evince the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e Proclamations publi&s;h'd again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;o as no Per&s;on or Par|ty in <HI>England</HI> may &s;eem ju&s;tly chargeable with the ruin of that Colony; a certain Evidence that the Crime is very black, and that they are put to a mi&s;erable &s;hift, when tho&s;e Gentlemen are at &s;uch expence of Contrivance and Pains to wipe off the Imputation, and &s;o ready to fall in with any Tool that they think can a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;o doing.</P>
<P>Enough has been &s;aid already to demon&s;trate that the evidence of &s;uch an infamous Per&s;on as <HI>H&mdash;s,</HI> and &s;o circum&s;tantiated, would not be admitted in any Court of Judicature in <HI>Europe,</HI> e&s;pecially again&s;t &s;uch an honourable Society as the Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> for trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of the very flower of the Nation, and perhaps has more Per&s;ons of illu|&s;trious
<PB N="2" REF="62">Birth, Quality and Merit in it, than any trading Company that ever yet was erected in the World. The Directors particularly, whom <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Ma&s;ters have condemned to the Halter, <HI>p.</HI> 46. are mo&s;t of them Per&s;ons of that Quality, E&s;tate, Worth, and untainted Honour, as the Ac|cu&s;ation of no one particular Per&s;on, tho of never &s;o good Repute, could in ju&s;tice or decency be ad|mitted again&s;t them, and much le&s;s the malicious Calumnies of a Renegado.</P>
<P>But to &s;et this matter in a clearer Light: Where|as we have only <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>'s own word for what he a&s;&s;erts in vindication of his Friends and Suborners; we &s;hall demon&s;trate again&s;t him and them too from undeniable matter of Fact, that &s;ome Peo|ple in <HI>England</HI> are ju&s;tly chargeable with the ruin of that Colony.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with the oppo&s;ition made to the <HI>Scots</HI> Act by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> (to whom the matter was mi&s;repre&s;ented) the An&s;wer they obtain'd from the King, and the Pro&s;ecution they commenc'd and threatned again&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Natives, and <HI>Scots-men</HI> re&s;iding in <HI>England,</HI> that &s;hould &s;ub|&s;cribe to the <HI>Scots</HI> Company.</P>
<P>In the next place we alledg the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident's Memorial at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> again&s;t that Governments &s;uffering any of their Subjects to &s;ub&s;cribe to the <HI>Scots</HI> Company.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e well enough known that the Influ|ence and Example of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court hinder'd the Sub&s;criptions of our Neighbours in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it be denied but this continued Thread of Oppo&s;ition from the Court of <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t needs hinder the Sub&s;criptions of a great many in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who could not but fore&s;ee that a Storm was threatned by &s;o many Clouds.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="62">
<P>To this we may add, that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> have not yet forgot the di&s;courting of the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Tweddale</HI> (who was known to be an able State&s;|man, and a true Patriot to his Country) becau&s;e of his touching that Act, when he had the Honor to repre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty on the Throne.</P>
<P>Nor was it the lea&s;t of our Misfortunes, that we lo&s;t &s;uch an able and faithful Mini&s;ter of State as Secretary <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> and that too upon the account of his Affection to his Country in this matter. We are very well &s;atisfied that his Maje&s;ty, who ad|vanc'd him to that Po&s;t for his Merit, and was &s;o well &s;atisfied with his ability and care, would &s;carcely have parted with a Mini&s;ter of that Gen|tleman's Faithfulne&s;s and Penetration, but by the Intrigues of &s;ome People at Court.</P>
<P>Before we proceed any further with the Narra|tive of the Oppo&s;ition made to us, we &s;hall obviate one Objection which &s;ome Per&s;ons may po&s;&s;ibly make, <HI>viz.</HI> That all we have &s;aid hitherto is no|thing to the purpo&s;e, becau&s;e it does not regard our Colony, but the Company. To which we re|ply: 1. That this is &s;o far from being an Excu&s;e to our Oppo&s;ers, that it highly aggravates our Charge again&s;t them, as being a plain demon&s;tra|tion, that they were re&s;olv'd to ob&s;truct our Trade in every re&s;pect, and whatever it &s;hould be, with|out any exception. 2. That the oppo&s;ing of the Company was the direct Method to prevent our ever having a Colony; and by the Laws of God and Man, tho&s;e who endeavour to de&s;troy the <HI>Embrio,</HI> are chargeable with a de&s;ign of prevent|ing the Birth. But we &s;hall come clo&s;er to the point in a little time, and re&s;ume the thread of our Narrative after one or two Ob&s;ervations upon what we have &s;aid already, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<ITEM>(2.)

</LIST>
<P>But to come directly to the Narrative of the Oppo&s;ition made to our Colony. It is well enough known that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as many other Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> have &s;uffered much for three or four years pa&s;t by bad. Harve&s;ts, which rendred them uncapable of providing Bread for their Peo|ple at home, and much more of &s;ending Supplies to their Infant Colony abroad: This was very manife&s;t to &s;ome People about <HI>White-hall,</HI> and care was taken we &s;hould have none for our Mony from <HI>England,</HI> tho that Nation could have &s;par'd it, and perhaps we might have pleaded it as our merit, when in Parliament we voted his Maje&s;ty a &s;tanding Army, upon his Royal Word that it was nece&s;&s;ary, tho we had more need to have &s;av'd the Mony to have bought Bread for thou&s;ands of our People that were &s;tarving for want, af|forded us the melancholy pro&s;pect of dying by &s;hoals in our Streets, and have left behind them a
<PB N="5" REF="63">reigning Contagion, which hath &s;wept away multitudes more, and God knows where it may end.</P>
<P>Tho our Country was reduced to this deplorable &s;tate, that a generous Enemy would have &s;hew'd us compa&s;&s;ion, yet the malice of our Court Adver|&s;aries did not re&s;t here, nor with having follow'd us into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> but pur&s;ues us into <HI>America;</HI> and with Angry Proclamations forbids the Subjects there, on pain of his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;|plea&s;ure, to afford any manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Darien:</HI> So that we are &s;tarv'd at home and abroad by our Enemies at Court, who having by this means di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd us of our Colony at <HI>Darien,</HI> and knowing that the good People of <HI>England</HI> had rea&s;on to cry &s;hame upon them, and might perhaps take their own time to re|&s;ent this inhuman Treatment of their Neighbours in <HI>Scotland;</HI> therefore they found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s a Book wrote in defence of the <HI>Scots</HI> Set|tlement, and to hire a <HI>Scots</HI> Renegado Surgeon to varni&s;h over the matter, and to repre&s;ent his Countrymen as Knaves and Fools, that &s;o they might fall unpitied.</P>
<P>To return again to the Oppo&s;ition made us in <HI>America:</HI> It is not enough that we are &s;tarv'd out of <HI>Darien,</HI> but when we come from thence, and &s;o leave what the Proclamations &s;uppo&s;e to be <HI>the Dominions of their Allies,</HI> yet we mu&s;t not be &s;up|plied in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, nor have Provi&s;ions in exchange for our effects, tho our Men be dying for want, on pain of incurring the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Court; and therefore tho&s;e who are willing to relieve us, mu&s;t put their Inventions on the rack to &s;ind out a way to do that with &s;afety, which common Humanity, and much more Chri&s;tianity, obliges them to do to a Turk or a Jew in the like circum&s;tances.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="64">
<P>Nay farther, tho notwith&s;tanding our di&s;tre&s;s at home, we make &s;hift to &s;end a Convoy to our Co|lony abroad, becau&s;e our future hopes depended &s;o much upon it, they &s;hall not have leave to put in to any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Port to refit, refre&s;h, or &s;tay for any of their Company that may be &s;eparated from them by &s;torm; and yet our Friends who were &s;o in|&s;trumental in obtaining and publi&s;hing tho&s;e Pro|clamations, mu&s;t bribe a Renegado to declare to the World in print, that they were no way ac|ce&s;&s;ary to the Blood of his Country-men that were &s;tarv'd to death at <HI>Darien.</HI></P>
<P>It will appear plain that the Ruin of the Colony is chargeable on the Proclamations, if we con&s;ider the Con&s;ternation that mu&s;t needs be among them when they &s;aw them&s;elves condemned, as hav|ing invaded the Dominions of his Maje&s;ty's Allies; &s;o that they had all the rea&s;on in the World to think that they were not only precluded from all po&s;&s;i|bility of having any further &s;upply or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from home, but in danger of being attack'd by his Fleet, as they that advis'd the emitting of tho&s;e Proclamations mu&s;t needs think his Maje&s;ty was oblig'd in Honour and Ju&s;tice to order, if he was of opinion that the <HI>Scots</HI> had broken the Alliance betwixt him and <HI>Spain.</HI> Let any rea&s;onable man con&s;ider what Angui&s;h and Perplexity the&s;e Con|&s;iderations, join'd to their pinching Wants and o|ther Circum&s;tances, mu&s;t occa&s;ion in the minds of tho&s;e poor men, and whether it might not give a handle to tho&s;e of them that were unwilling to &s;tay, to mutiny again&s;t the re&s;t, and put all into di&s;order, which might be fomented by other ill per&s;ons among&s;t them; for we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that with 11 or 1200 men, there went no other ill man but <HI>H&mdash;s,</HI> &s;ince it's not improbable that they who oppo&s;ed our Company &s;o much from the very
<PB N="7" REF="64">beginning, might be prompted by the &s;ame Malice to &s;end Spies and Traitors among&s;t our Men on purpo&s;e to defeat their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>If it had not been that they were thus di&s;cou|raged and brought to their wits-end by tho&s;e Pro|clamations, they would certainly have had &s;o much Conduct as to have &s;ent away a great part of their Men to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, where they might have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted till the arrival of a Convoy from <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;o with tho&s;e Pro|vi&s;ions that were &s;ufficient to carry them as far as <HI>New York,</HI> and a great deal further if they had not been retarded by Tempe&s;ts, might have maintain'd a competent number of their Men to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Colony till Supplies had arriv'd: but the Proclamations di&s;abled them from taking this Me|thod, and by con&s;equence are chargeable with the ruin of the Colony.</P>
<P>In the next place, it is undeniable that tho&s;e Pro|clamations mu&s;t needs have incouraged the <HI>Spain|ards</HI> and other Enemies in their Oppo&s;ition again&s;t our Colony, and animated them to go on with their Preparations to drive us out. So that had they de|&s;erted upon no other account but the noi&s;e of the great Preparations making again&s;t them by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Carthagena, Porto Bello,</HI> &amp;c, as Sir <HI>Wil|liam Bee&s;ton</HI> &s;eem'd to in&s;inuate in his Letter; it makes the Proclamations directly chargeable with the Ruin of the Colony, &s;ince they had good rea|&s;on to remove from thence when their own Prince had forbid all Commerce with them, and when their Enemies were making formidable Prepara|tions again&s;t them.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e plain that tho&s;e Proclamations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prevent their having any Supplies from the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Cura&s;&s;aw,</HI> if they had any to &s;pare: for &s;ince the Influence of ours and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Court
<PB N="8" REF="65">prevented our Company's having any Incourage|ment in <HI>Holland,</HI> it is rea&s;onable to believe it would have the &s;ame influence in reference to our Colony, in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plantations.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e all the rea&s;on in the world to conclude, that the Influence of tho&s;e Proclama|tions might hinder the Natives from giving our Colony tho&s;e Supplies that it was in their power to have done; for there's no doubt but they had in|formation of 'em indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ent them by &s;ome of our Adver&s;aries, when Capt. <HI>Long</HI> was &s;o malici|ous as to endeavour at our fir&s;t arrival to po&s;&s;e&s;s them with an opinion that we were nothing but Pirats, and that the K. of <HI>Great Britain</HI> would di&s;|own us; and indeed by the event it would &s;eem he had In&s;tructions &s;o to do. It is true that at fir&s;t the Natives &s;eeing our Men have a Competency of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, might not believe his Re|port; but they mu&s;t needs have been confirm'd in the truth of it afterwards, when they &s;aw them dying for want, and deceiv'd as to their Expecta|tion of further Supplies; and upon that account might think they had &s;ufficient ground to withdraw their A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, and not further pro|voke the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in favour of a People that they found were not able to do any thing for them&s;elves, and by con&s;equence uncapable to protect them, which was the thing they were to expect from their Alliance.</P>
<P>Having thus made it evident that the Oppo&s;ition our Company met with from Court at fir&s;t, and the Proclamations i&s;&s;ued again&s;t our Colony at la&s;t, are ju&s;tly to be reputed among the principal Cau&s;es of the Mi&s;carriage of that De&s;ign, we come in the next place to con&s;ider his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer to the Addre&s;s of the Commons of <HI>England</HI> on that Head, and the Proclamations i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t us in his Name in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="65">
<P>We are &s;orry that ever there &s;hould have been any occa&s;ion for &s;uch an ungrateful piece of work; but think it a Duty incumbent upon us, and what we owe to the Con&s;titution of our Country, which we have rea&s;on to believe is indu&s;triou&s;ly conceal'd from his Maje&s;ty, to write freely on this head, that the World may &s;ee what ju&s;t cau&s;e we have to com|plain.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer, <HI>That he had been ill &s;erv'd in</HI> Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is &s;uch, as our Ance&s;tors (if we may believe our Hi&s;torians) would have thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in a King of <HI>Scots,</HI> a manife&s;t Reflection upon the Ju&s;tice and Fi|delity of the Nation, and a di&s;covery of their <HI>Arcana Imperii</HI> to tho&s;e that were quarrelling with them. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e that his Maje&s;ty would give an An&s;wer to an Addre&s;s of this Impor|tance without Coun&s;el: If he con&s;ulted with our <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Oppo&s;ers, it was the &s;ame as if he had con&s;ulted our profe&s;&s;ed Enemies; if he con|&s;ulted with <HI>Scots</HI>-men, and was advis'd to this An|&s;wer by any of them, they are Traitors to their Country, and have betray'd its Soveraignty: for they ought to have advis'd him to an&s;wer, that as King of <HI>Scots</HI> he was not to give an account to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for any thing tran&s;acted in that Kingdom; but if they found them&s;elves any ways aggrivev'd, or thought their Trade endanger'd by the <HI>Scots</HI> Act, he &s;hould be willing to have the matter debated and adju&s;ted by Commi&s;&s;ioners of both Nations, as became the Common Father of both. This could not ju&s;tly have been look'd upon by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> as a refractory or &s;tubborn An&s;wer, but mu&s;t have been imputed to his bravene&s;s of Temper, and fidelity to his Tru&s;t. But at once to give up the Soveraignty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> without demurring upon it, argues that his Maje&s;ty was advis'd
<PB N="10" REF="66">to this An&s;wer by Enemies to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>Our Parliaments have originally a greater Power than that of <HI>England;</HI> for what the States of <HI>Scot|land</HI> offer'd to the touch of the Scepter, their Kings had no power to refu&s;e; or if they did, the Re|&s;olves of the States had the force of a Law not|with&s;tanding. Thus our Reformation was e&s;tab|li&s;hed in 1560, by an Act of the States; and tho our Queen <HI>Mary</HI> then in <HI>France,</HI> and her Husband the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> afterwards <HI>Francis</HI> I. refus'd to give their Con&s;ent, it remain'd a firm Law; which Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> when &s;he return'd to <HI>Scotland,</HI> was &s;o far from offering to di&s;pen&s;e with, tho &s;he was a great A&s;&s;erter of her Prerogative, that &s;he was oblig'd to intreat of the States &s;o far to di&s;pen&s;e with it them&s;elves, as to &s;uffer her to have Ma&s;s in her own Family. We might go farther back to the Reign of <HI>Robert</HI> II. who was check'd by the States for making a Truce with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> without their Con|&s;ent, it not being then in the power of our Kings either to make Peace or War without the States. But the Truth of that Maxim laid down by our Hi&s;torian, <HI>That the &s;upreme Power of the Govern|ment of</HI> Scotland <HI>is in the States,</HI> is &s;o obvious to every one that reads our Hi&s;tory, that it cannot be denied; and hence it is that our old Acts of Parliament are often call'd <HI>the Acts of the States,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>The three States enact,</HI> &amp;c. for by our O|riginal Con&s;titution the King is none of the States, but only <HI>Dux belli,</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ter publicus;</HI> which was well under&s;tood by our Viceroy the E. of <HI>Mor|ton,</HI> and the other Deputies from the States of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> when they acquainted Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in their Memorial, That <HI>the</HI> Scots <HI>created their Kings on that condition, that they might, when they &s;aw cau&s;e, di|ve&s;t them of that Power which they receiv'd from the People,</HI> which we have now rea&s;&s;erted in making
<PB N="11" REF="66"><HI>our Crown forfeitable by the Claim of Right at the la&s;t Revolution:</HI> and perhaps that's none of the lea&s;t Cau&s;es why our Ruin is now endeavour'd by the Abettors of a growing Prerogative.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y for us to enlarge on this, and to &s;hew from our Hi&s;tories and Acts of Parliaments, that our Kings, according to our antient Con&s;titution (which tho&s;e Rapes committed on our Liberties in &s;ome of the la&s;t Reigns can never overturn) were inferior to their Parliaments, who inthron'd and dethron'd them as they &s;aw cau&s;e, made them ac|countable for their Admini&s;tration, allow'd them no power of proroguing them without their own con&s;ent, nor of hindering their meeting when the <HI>ardua Regni negotia</HI> requir'd it. They could not make Peace or War without them, nor &s;o much as di&s;po&s;e of their Ca&s;tles, but by their Con&s;ent. Their Councils were cho&s;en and &s;worn in Parlia|ment, and puni&s;hable by the States: Nor had they any Revenue, but what their Parliaments allow'd them. The&s;e and many more were the native Li|berties of the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> an 1638. and their Repre&s;entation of their Proceedings again&s;t the Mi&s;takes in the King's Declaration in 1640. And therefore his Maje&s;ty had no rea&s;on to &s;ay he was ill &s;erv'd by the pa&s;&s;ing of an Act offer'd by the States of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Ignorance of tho&s;e things have often occa|fion'd our being mi&s;repre&s;ented by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi|&s;torians, and other Writers, as Rebels, and what not, when we really acted according to our own fundamental Laws. And not only they, but even our own Princes &s;ince the Union of the Crowns, have either been kept ignorant of our Con&s;titu|tion, or &s;o incens'd again&s;t it by the Abettors of
<PB N="12" REF="67">Tyranny, that they have all of 'em, his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty excepted, endeavour'd our Overthrow, as well knowing it to be impo&s;&s;ible to bring Arbi|trary Government to perfection, whil&s;t a People who had always breath'd in a free Air, and call'd their Princes to an account when they invaded their Properties, were in any condition to defend them|&s;elves, or a&s;&s;i&s;t others again&s;t &s;uch Princes as de|&s;ign'd an ab&s;olute Sway. But the Pill being too bitter to be &s;wallowed by it &s;elf, there was a nece&s;|&s;ity of taking Prie&s;tcraft into the Compo&s;ition, and to gild it over with the &s;pecious pretext of bringing the <HI>Scots</HI> to an Uniformity in Religion. The Court knew that this would arm the Zealots a|gain&s;t us, and that it could never be aflected with|out the ruin of our Kingdom, who&s;e Religion was &s;o interwoven with our Civil Con&s;titution, that there was no overturning of the one, without &s;ub|verting the other. This will appear plain to tho&s;e that know, that be&s;ides the Sanction of Acts of Parliament, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is defended by a full Repre&s;entative of the Clergy and Laity of the Kingdom call'd a General A&s;&s;embly (which pre&s;erves us from being Prie&s;t-ridden, as our Par|liaments do from being Prince-ridden) where the King by Law had no negative Voice, no more than he formerly had in our Parliaments. This in effect is the Repre&s;entative of the Nation as Chri|&s;tians, as the Parliaments are our Repre&s;entatives as Men; and as to the Laity, many of them are the &s;ame individual Per&s;ons that &s;it in Parliament. So that tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies being a &s;econd Barrier a|bout our Liberties, it was thought &s;it to run down the Con&s;titution of our Church, as not &s;uted with Monarchy. The Ca&s;e being thus, we dare refer it to the thoughts of our neighbouring Nation, who have gallantly from time to time &s;tood up for
<PB N="13" REF="67">their own Liberties, whether it were not more ge|nerous for them to unite with us than to &s;uffer us to be oppre&s;s'd and en&s;lav'd.</P>
<P>There's nothing can be objected to this, but that all the&s;e glorious Privileges were &s;wallow'd up by tho&s;e Acts of Parliament that exalted the Prero|gative to &s;uch a height in the Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. To which we an&s;wer, That the Privileges of a Nation cannot be giv'n away without their own con&s;ent; and we are morally certain, that the Con|&s;tituents even of tho&s;e pack'd Parliaments did ne|ver give any commi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e that repre&s;ented them, to give away tho&s;e Liberties. Slavery is repugnant to human Nature; &s;o that it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed the Nation exalted the Prerogative on purpo&s;e to put them&s;elves in a wor&s;e condition than be&s;ore, or that when they find it applied to ano|ther u&s;e than that which they gave it for, they may not reduce it to its antient Boundary. The nece&s;|&s;ity of Affairs did &s;ometimes oblige the <HI>Romans</HI> to entru&s;t their Dictators with an extraordinary and ab&s;olute Power; but when the occa&s;ion ceas'd, they recalled it, and kept to their antient and rational Maxim, that <HI>Salus Populi</HI> is <HI>&s;uprema Lex.</HI> In the like manner the Enemies of our old Con&s;titution may know, if they plea&s;e, that we have retrieved the main point of making our Crown forfeitable by the Claim of Right; and therefore if they pu&s;h us too far, it's a thou&s;and to one but we may renew our Demands to the re&s;t, or oblige them to ca&s;t them into the bargain.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion. Tho we had no &s;uch peculiar Privileges belonging to us; why might not we expect that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be as kind to us as to our Brethren in <HI>England?</HI> He hath once and again declared to them in Parliament, <HI>That he never had, nor never will have an Intere&s;t. di|&s;tinct
<PB N="14" REF="68">from that of his People.</HI> Then why &s;hould not the Intere&s;t of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> be the &s;ame with the Intere&s;t of the King of <HI>Scots?</HI> And if the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> met in Parliament, agreed upon it as their Intere&s;t to have that Act pa&s;t for incou|raging Kieir Trade, how was it po&s;&s;ible that the King of <HI>Scots</HI> could be <HI>ill &s;erv'd</HI> by the pa&s;&s;ing that Act in <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>Our Enemies, and <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>'s Suborners have put a &s;ort of an An&s;wer to this in his mouth, <HI>viz.</HI> That the &s;aid Act was obtain'd <HI>viis &amp; modis;</HI> but the Fal&s;hood and Malice of that In&s;inuation will appear to the World by the previous Act of 1693. for in|couraging of foreign Trade, by which it was &s;ta|tuted, <Q>That Merchants more or fewer may con|tract and enter into &s;uch Societies and Compa|nies for carrying on Trade, as to any Subject of Goods or Merchandi&s;e, to what&s;omever King|doms, Countries, or parts of the World, not being in War with his Maje&s;ty, where Trade is in u&s;e to be or may be follow'd; and particular|ly, be&s;ides the Kingdoms and Countries of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> to the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the <HI>Straits,</HI> and to trade in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> or upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> or el&s;ewhere, as above.

<PB N="15" REF="68">to them the whole fore&s;aid Powers and Privi|leges, with what other incouragement his Maje&s;ty &s;hould judg needful.</Q> The&s;e are the very terms of the Act of 1693. and in pur&s;uance of this Act our Nation being willing to form a Company for trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> this Act which hath met with &s;o much oppo&s;ition in the World, was pa&s;t <HI>June</HI> 26. 1695. which was two years after. Then with what Effrontery can <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborners &s;ugge&s;t, that it was obtain'd <HI>viis &amp; modis,</HI> by &s;urpri&s;e or in a &s;ur|reptitious manner? But &s;omething they mu&s;t &s;ay to ju&s;tify their unrea&s;onable treatment of us, and to blind the Eyes of the World.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee then that the Parliament of <HI>Scot|land</HI> went on deliberately to advance their Trade, and to make this Act: by which it's evident that they who advis'd his Maje&s;ty to &s;ay that he was <HI>ill &s;erv'd in</HI> Scotland, impos'd upon him, have laid a Foundation of divi&s;ion betwixt him and his Par|liament, which are the two con&s;tituent parts of our Government; and if they be da&s;h'd again&s;t one another, the whole frame of it mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity be di&s;&s;olv'd. Hence al&s;o it is evident that tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors, if <HI>Scots-men,</HI> ought by our old Con&s;titution to be call'd to an account by the Parliament according to the 12th Act of Parl. 2 <HI>James</HI> 4. And if they be Engli&s;hmen or Dutch|men, we have a right to demand Ju&s;tice again&s;t them, as having meddled in our Affairs contrary to the Laws of Nations.</P>
<P>The Soveraignty of our Nation, and the Inde|pendency of the K. of <HI>Scots</HI> upon the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> being tacitely giv'n up by this An&s;wer; and the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by our Enemies with a fal&s;e. Notion of our De&s;ign, they put a &s;top to our taking Sub&s;criptions from
<PB N="16" REF="69">any Re&s;identers in <HI>England;</HI> tho our offering to take in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as Sharers, was a plain Demon|&s;tration of the uprightne&s;s of our Intentions to|wards that Nation. This made it apparent, that we had no de&s;ign in the lea&s;t to &s;upplant them in their Trade, but on the contrary to make them Partakers in ours, in order to lay a foundation for a clo&s;er Union, and greater Amity betwixt the two Nations; which if it had taken effect, our Trade had not been nipp'd in the bud, as now it is by the frowns of the Court, but might by this time have been improv'd to the advancement of the glory and &s;trength of the I&s;land: Whereas by the oppo&s;ition made to that noble De&s;ign, the Nations are more alienated from one another than before, le&s;&s;en'd in their Strength and Trade, and <HI>Scotland</HI> for ever lo&s;t as to their Friend&s;hip, u&s;efulne&s;s, and joining with <HI>England</HI> on any occa&s;ion whatever, un|le&s;s proper Mea&s;ures be taken to make up the Breach, and retrieve our lo&s;t Honour and Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>All that can be &s;aid to excu&s;e &s;o fal&s;e a &s;tep in &s;uch a wi&s;e Nation as <HI>England,</HI> is, that they were impos'd upon by tho&s;e that are Enemies to the true Liberties of both Nations, and by &s;ome of their Traders and ignorant Pretenders, to give advice in matters of Trade, who out of a &s;ordid Principle of Self-intere&s;t, preferr'd their own pri|vate Gain to the general advantage of their Country. This would have quickly been &s;een, had his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> in&s;tead of that violent oppo&s;ition which they made to the <HI>Scots</HI> Act, de&s;ir'd a conference betwixt a Committee of the Parliaments of both Nations; then it would &s;oon have appear'd what our true De&s;ign was, and that it was neither our Intere&s;t nor Inten|tion immediately to follow an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade,
<PB N="17" REF="69">the apprehen&s;ions of which did &s;o much alarm the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> That it was not our Inten|tion is evident from our rejecting the Propo&s;als of our Countryman Mr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Merchant, with which <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> upbraids us, by which at the &s;ame time he di&s;covers his own folly and di&s;hone&s;ty; his Folly in arguing again&s;t the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> which he pretends to e&s;pou&s;e; and his Di&s;hone&s;ty in propo&s;ing our fol|lowing a Trade, which his new Ma&s;ters (who have paid him &s;o well for his fal&s;e Evidence) look upon to be de&s;tructive to theirs.</P>
<P>That it was not our Intere&s;t immediately to think of an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade is evident from this, that it would have exported our Mony with which it's known we do not abound, and ruin'd the Linen Manufacture of our Country, upon which &s;o ma|ny of our Poor depend. This we think the City of <HI>London</HI> may be &s;en&s;ible of in a good mea&s;ure, by the multitudes of their own Silk-Weavers, that are &s;tarv'd for want of Imployment; and al&s;o by the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of their own Linen Manu|facture in <HI>England,</HI> by rea&s;on of the great quantity of Silks, Mu&s;lins, Calicoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> from whence &s;ome wi&s;e Men have been and are &s;till of opinion, that an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade of that &s;ort tends to the general Impoveri&s;hment of <HI>Europe,</HI> tho it may enrich particular Per&s;ons. The&s;e Con&s;iderations, together with &s;ome Jealou|&s;ies that Mr. <HI>Douglas</HI> might have been put upon making us that Propo&s;al, on purpo&s;e to divert us from our other De&s;ign of an <HI>American</HI> Trade, were the true Rea&s;ons of our not hearkening to Mr. <HI>Douglas</HI>'s Advice. This our Neighbours might have known, had they proceeded with us in &s;uch a Friendly manner as we had rea&s;on to expect, when we were &s;o kind as to offer them a &s;hare
<PB N="18" REF="70">in the Benefits of our Act. And the Government at the &s;ame time might &s;oon have been &s;atisfied, that the &s;inking of their Cu&s;toms by our own and twenty years Freedom from that Duty, was a meer bugbear Pretence. It is evident that we could not have &s;pent much <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t have exported them. If we had brought them to <HI>England,</HI> they were liable to Cu&s;toms there. If we had offer'd to run them over the Border, they could as well have pre|vented that, as the &s;tealing over their own Corn and Wool: and if we had exported them to any other places of <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by their Draw|backs could have done it in effect as cheap as we. By all which it appears, that there was no &s;olid Foundation for any of tho&s;e pretended Rea&s;ons, why the Government in particular, or the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in general, &s;hould have oppos'd us: and we wi&s;h that upon due inquiry it may not be found to be the effect of Dutch Councils; for that Peo|ple being jealous of their Trade, and Rivals to <HI>England</HI> on that account, cannot be &s;uppos'd to have &s;at &s;till and done nothing, when they &s;aw we had obtain'd &s;uch an Act, and were re&s;olv'd to take in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to partake in our Trade, which if &s;uffer'd to go on, might endanger theirs, and enable the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to outrival them indeed, be&s;ides the pre&s;ent lo&s;s they fore&s;aw of our Cu&s;tom, the <HI>Scots</HI> having mo&s;t of their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>This we have the more rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, fir&s;t becau&s;e tho the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have formerly &s;uffered in their Trade by the Incroachments and Intrigues of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but never by the <HI>Scots;</HI> yet they have made no Application to his Maje&s;ty, for preventing the like in time to come. If it be &s;aid that be is but Stadtholder there, whereas he is
<PB N="19" REF="70">K. of <HI>Scots:</HI> We can ea&s;ily reply, that it appears: by what has been &s;aid already of our true Con&s;ti|tution, that the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were as much ac|countable to the States of that Nation as the Dutch Stadtholder is to the States of <HI>Holland.</HI> The 2 <HI>d</HI> Rea&s;on we have to &s;u&s;pect the Influence of Dutch Councils in this Affair, is this, that 'tis their Intere&s;t to keep us and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from uniting, and if po&s;&s;ible of forcing us by that means into an Alliance with them&s;elves, to prevent their own ruin, if <HI>England</HI> after this &s;hould come to fall out with them upon the account of Trade or other|wi&s;e, and likewi&s;e to have their Privilege of fi&s;hing in our Seas continued, which they know to be of &s;uch va&s;t Advantage to them, that they are &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected of having by Bribes, or other indirect Methods, prevail'd with &s;ome great Men, to &s;upplant us as to the Benefits we had ju&s;t rea|&s;on to expect from the Act of 1661. incouraging our Fi&s;hery; the Privileges granted by which, are very con&s;iderable, and to continue for ever: nay to put it out of all doubt that they are join'd in this matter again&s;t us, <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> owns it as beforemention'd.</P>
<P>Being upon this Subject, we cannot but take notice of the difference betwixt the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Me|morials about <HI>Darien,</HI> and of tho&s;e late Memori|als pre&s;ented by them to our Court again&s;t their meddling with the Succe&s;&s;ion of that Monarchy, or the cantoning it out into &s;everal Parcels in ca&s;e the King of <HI>Spain</HI> die without I&s;&s;ue. The for|mer, tho in&s;olent and hu&s;&s;ing enough, were pro|cur'd by our Court, therefore calmly dige&s;ted; and the de&s;ire of them effectually an&s;wer'd, to the ruin almo&s;t of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation: but the lat|ter was no &s;ooner pre&s;ented, than the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors
<PB N="20" REF="71">are di&s;grac'd in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and forbid both Courts.</P>
<P>It may therefore de&s;erve the Inquiry of our Neighbours, what this Regulation about the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the di&s;membring of their Monarchy is, that occa&s;ion &s;uch outragious Me|morials: for there mu&s;t needs be &s;omething in it that touches the <HI>Spaniards</HI> more &s;en&s;ibly than the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Darien,</HI> and which they did not com|plain of till they were put upon it; and in like manner touches our court more &s;en&s;ibly to the quick than any Memorials about that Affair, tho they had not been of their own procurement, were capable of doing. Perhaps upon a narrow Scru|tiny into this Affair it will be found, that this keen and uninterrupted Oppo&s;ition made to the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement at <HI>Darien,</HI> does not proceed from any fore&s;ight of damage that it could do to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> tho that be the &s;pecious Pretext, but from a Cau&s;e which touches &s;ome People more nearly, cro&s;&s;es their Project of di&s;|membring the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, and of having that important Po&s;t to their own &s;hare; they know that they have a natural, as well as a politi|cal Intere&s;t in &s;ome great Courtiers, and make little doubt of obtaining the preheminence before either of tho&s;e Nations that compo&s;e the Empire of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It concerns our Neighbours &s;o much the more to inquire into this, becau&s;e it is vi&s;ible from the Re&s;entments of it by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Court, that this matter is more like to affect the advantageous Trade that <HI>England</HI> drives with <HI>Spain,</HI> than our Settlement in <HI>America</HI> was ever like to do; which tho it be made a Sacrifice to his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and perhaps on purpo&s;e to make him dige&s;t the other Project with more
<PB N="21" REF="71">ea&s;e, is like to be of as little advantage to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as was the Sacrifice of the great Sir <HI>Wal|ter Raleigh</HI> formerly, tho it may be infinitely more to their damage. If our Neighbours have a mind to be fully inform'd of this matter, they know who were imploy'd in tho&s;e Negotiations, and how to &s;peak with them.</P>
<P>We come next to con&s;ider the Oppo&s;ition made to our Sub&s;criptions at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> by Sir <HI>Paul Ri|caut</HI> the Engli&s;h Re&s;ident there, in conjunction with his Maje&s;ty's Envoy to the Court of <HI>Lu|nenburg,</HI> who deliver'd in a joint Memorial to the Senate of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> threatning them with the heighth of his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure, if they join'd with the <HI>Scots</HI> in any Treaty of Commerce what|&s;oever. This we &s;hall not need to make any Reflexions upon, the Petitions from the Company to his Maje&s;ty and his Privy Council in <HI>Scotland</HI> be|ing &s;ufficient for that end.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="74">what&s;oever, but have al&s;o had all the promi|&s;ing hopes and pro&s;pect of foreign Aid that our hearts could wi&s;h, till (to our great &s;urprize) the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> have, under pretence of &s;pecial Warrant from his Maje&s;ty, put a &s;top thereto, by giving in a Memorial to the Senat of that City, threatning both Senat and Inhabitants with the King's utmo&s;t Di&s;plea|&s;ure, if they &s;hould countenance or join with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce, as by the annexed Copy thereof may appear.</P>

In the full a&s;&s;urance of which we re&s;ted &s;ecure, and took our mea&s;ures according|ly, till to our further &s;urprize and un&s;peakable prejudice, we find by repeated Advices from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> that the &s;aid Re&s;ident continues &s;till contumacious; and is &s;o far from giving due O|bedience to his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid Order, that upon application made to him by our Agent in that City, with all the re&s;pect due to his Character he declared, that as yet he had got no &s;uch Order on our behalf; which by a further Ad|dre&s;s we are now to lay before his Maje&s;ty.</P>

So that if effectual mea&s;ures be not taken for putting an early &s;top to &s;uch an open and violent Infringement of, and Incroachment upon the Privileges of &s;o &s;o|lemn a Con&s;titution, 'tis hard to gue&s;s how far it may in after Ages be made u&s;e of as a Prece|dent for invading and overturning even the ve|ry Fundamental Rights, natural Liberties, and indi&s;putable Independency of this Kingdom, which by the now open and frequent Practices of our unkind Neighbours, &s;eem to be too &s;hrewdly pointed at.

<P>By all this it is evideht, that the whole King|dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> was unanimous in this matter and proceeded deliberately in it, as that which highly concern'd their Intere&s;t: yet we &s;ee that all their Endeavours were to no purpo&s;e; for our Enemies were &s;o re&s;olute in oppo&s;ing our Trade, that rather than it &s;hould &s;ucceed they will not only trample under foot the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the Laws of Nations, and exactly follow the Pattern &s;et them by the <HI>French,</HI> in huffing and tyrannizing over their Neighbours, when at the &s;ame time they pretend to make War upon <HI>Lewis</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="78">XIV. for practices of the &s;ame nature; and whil&s;t they cry out upon the Deci&s;ions of the Chambers of <HI>Bri&s;ac</HI> and <HI>Mets,</HI> and of the Parlia|ment of <HI>Paris</HI> as tyrannical and unju&s;t for invading the Rights of Neighbouring Princes and Nations, they &s;et up a Cabal at <HI>Whitehall</HI> to do the like by <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> Then let the World judg, whether the King of <HI>England</HI> had not le&s;s rea&s;on to &s;ay that he was ill &s;erv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than the King of <HI>Scots</HI> had to &s;ay that he was ill &s;erv'd in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince one &s;ingle Addre&s;s from the Parlia|ment of <HI>England</HI> prevail'd with their King to forbid all his Subjects to join with the <HI>Scots;</HI> whereas the repeated Supplications of the Company of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> the Addre&s;s of their Parliament, and the Au|thority of Law, and his own Letters Patent could not prevail with the King of <HI>Scots</HI> to do Ju&s;tice to his own Subjects. We wi&s;h the&s;e Gentlemen would con&s;ider this, who were &s;o very angry at the Author of the Defence of the <HI>Scots</HI> Settle|ment, for &s;aying that the King of <HI>Scots</HI> was detain'd pri&s;oner in <HI>England.</HI> It is very certain, that never any King of <HI>Scotland</HI> before the Union of the Crowns, dar'd thus to trample upon their Laws, or to oppo&s;e the General Intere&s;t of the Nation; or if they attempted to do it, they were quickly made &s;en&s;ible of their being inferior to the Law, and the States of the Nation a&s;&s;embled in Parlia|ment, who till the Acce&s;&s;ion of our Princes to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne, remain'd in an undi&s;puted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of calling their Kings to an account for Male|admini&s;tration, and of di&s;po&s;ing of thei Lives and Liberties as they &s;aw cau&s;e. We need not go &s;o far back for Evidence to prove this, as <HI>Eugenius</HI> the 7th, who was brought to his Tryal on &s;u&s;piti|on of having murder'd his own Wife, and acquitted upon di&s;covery of the real Murderers; or of <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="78">III. who&s;e Minions, by who&s;e Council he govern|ed, were taken out of his own Bed-Chamber by the Nobles, and hanged over <HI>Lauder-bridg;</HI> and he him&s;elf per&s;i&s;ting in tho&s;e Cour&s;es, was killed in flight, after being defeated in Battle by the States, and in the next Parliament was voted to be lawfully &s;lain.</P>
<P>We have a later In&s;tance, and the Power of our Nation on that Head was largely a&s;&s;erted and accounted for by the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> then Regent of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in that noble Memorial he delivered in to Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her Council in defence of our proceedings again&s;t Q. <HI>Mary</HI> whom we de|thron'd, and in her &s;tead &s;et up her Son: &s;o that it is not the principle or practice of any one Party of our Nation (tho it has been of late fix'd upon the Presbyterians as peculiar to them) but was an Hereditary Right conveyed to us all by our An|ce&s;tors, practi&s;ed by Papi&s;ts before the Reforma|tion, and ju&s;ti&s;ied by tho&s;e of the Epi&s;copal Per|&s;wa&s;ion &s;ince, particularly by the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> beforemention'd, who was the fir&s;t that introduc'd Bi&s;hops into our Church after the Reformation.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e things are not in&s;i&s;ted upon with any De&s;ign of applying them to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, or of incen&s;ing the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> to do &s;o, but only to inform tho&s;e that put his Maje&s;ty upon &s;uch Cour&s;es, that they are his greate&s;t Enemies, and do what in them lies to de&s;troy him. It is the common Right of Mankind to be protected by tho&s;e they &s;et over them, and to complain of Governors when they find them&s;elves aggriev'd, and their Privileges torn from them by Violence. This Generation has prov'd it beyond po&s;&s;ibility of Reply, that the greate&s;t Pretenders to &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on to Princes, and the mo&s;t zealous Patrons of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, will re&s;i&s;t and dethrone their
<PB N="36" REF="79">Kings too, when they find them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed by them. They that maintain the contrary, are nothing but mean-&s;pirited Flatterers, or &s;uch as temporize with Courts, becau&s;e of their own private Advantage; and be their Quality what it will, are far from being &s;o noble and brave as that poor Woman who told <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> that he ceas'd to be King when he refus'd to hear her Petition. Upon the whole it will appear, that he Author of the Defence of the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement, made the be&s;t Apology for his Ma|je&s;ty that could be made, when he &s;aid that he was a Pri&s;oner in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore forc'd to act thus again&s;t the Intere&s;t and Dignity of his Crown as King of <HI>Scots.</HI> It is demon&s;trated thus: If his Maje&s;ty were in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and another Per|&s;on upon the Throne of <HI>England,</HI> it is certain his Maje&s;ty would have encouraged the Trade of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and re&s;ented &s;uch practices in the King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as contrary to the Laws of Nations, and the Soveraignty of his Crown: If he did not, he would be look'd upon to be mean-&s;pirited, and not fit to wear it; and if he took part with the King of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Dignity of his Crown, and the Intere&s;t of his Kingdom, he would not only be looked upon as an Enemy to his Country, but as <HI>felo de &s;e.</HI> From all which it is plain, that as it is the be&s;t Apology that can be made for the King of <HI>Scots</HI> when he acts thus, contrary to the Ho|nour and Intere&s;t of him&s;elf and his Country, to &s;ay, he is a Pri&s;oner in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o it is a &s;uf|ficient Ju&s;tification of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> to refu&s;e Obedience to what he commands by the In|fluence of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or other Councils, in oppo&s;iti|on to their Intere&s;t, becau&s;e they are the Commands of a Captive, and not of the King of <HI>Scots.</HI> If our Enemies &s;ay he is no Captive, but at Liberty
<PB N="37" REF="79">to go to <HI>Scotland</HI> if he plea&s;es, it is &s;o far from making his Ca&s;e better, that it makes it ten times wor&s;e; for if his Affections be captivated, we are without remedy, except we either &s;ue for a Divorce, as in ca&s;e of wilful De&s;ertion, and de|nying conjugal Duty, or withdraw from under his roof, and remove to another Family, as God and Man will allow one Si&s;ter to do that is oppre&s;&s;ed, and denied the Privileges of paternal Love and Protection, whil&s;t another is care&s;&s;ed and dan|dled, and has her Fortune rai&s;ed by dimini&s;hing that of the neglected Si&s;ter.</P>

<P>It contains a heavy Charge again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Company as having &s;ettled in <HI>Darien</HI> without in|forming his Maje&s;ty, and having thereby broke the Peace betwixt his Maje&s;ty and his Allies. As to their not intorming his Maje&s;ty with their De&s;ign, there was neither any need of it, nor had they rea&s;on to do it: that there was no need of it, is plain enough from the Act of Parliament impower|ing them to &s;ettle any where in <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> upon places not inhabited, or any other place, with con&s;ent of the Natives, and not po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd by any <HI>European</HI> Potentate, Prince or State: So that they were under no Obligation to acquaint him where they de&s;ign'd to &s;ettle, provided they kept to the Terms of the Act. And that they had no cau&s;e &s;o to do, is evident from that un|rea&s;onable oppo&s;ition that a Faction of Court had prevailed with him to make to them all along, which gave them ju&s;t cau&s;e to expect the like treat|ment in time to come.</P>
<P>Then as to the Breach of the Peace betwixt his Maje&s;ty and his Allies by the Settlement, they had no rea&s;on to think them&s;elves guilty of any &s;uch thing, and &s;o much the le&s;s, that <HI>Dampier, Wafer,</HI> and all others that wrote of the Country gave an Ac|count
<PB N="39" REF="80">of the Natives being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Liberty, and almo&s;t in continual Wars with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Be&s;ides, it was a rul'd Ca&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince Capt. <HI>Sharp</HI> was by Law acquitted in King <HI>Charles</HI> Il's time, not only for having marched through <HI>Darien</HI> in a Ho&s;tile manner, but for at|tacquing Places that were really in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as St. <HI>Maria</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> becau&s;e he acted by virtue of a Commi&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e <HI>Darien</HI> Princes. This, together with their not finding a <HI>Spaniard</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gari&s;on on all that part of the I&s;thmus, was enough to ju&s;tify the fairne&s;s of the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement there, and to have put a &s;top to this ha&s;ty Sentence till both &s;ides had been heard.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of that, the Advi&s;ers to this Procla|mation take upon them, in a very Magi&s;terial manner, to declare the <HI>Scots</HI> guilty of a Breach of the Peace betwixt his Maje&s;ty and his Allies: which is &s;o much the more remarkable, that this Procla|mation is publi&s;h'd in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> before ever it was known what the <HI>Scots</HI> could &s;ay in their own defence; and &s;ent away before the pre&s;enting of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Memorial, which was on the third of <HI>May</HI> 1699. and the Proclamation bears date <HI>April 9th</HI> 1699.</P>
<P>The unfairne&s;s of this Proclamation is evident from this, that at the very &s;ame time it is pub|li&s;h'd in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Lord Pre&s;ident of the Se&s;&s;ions, and his Maje&s;ty's Advocate for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were &s;ent for from hence to &s;ee what they could &s;ay to ju&s;tify their Preten&s;ions to <HI>Darien;</HI> which they did by &s;uch Arguments as have not yet been an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>We leave it then to the impartial Thoughts of the good People of <HI>England,</HI> whether we have not occa&s;ion to &s;ay that our King is in the Hand of our Enemies, &s;ince we are thus condemn'd with|out
<PB N="40" REF="81">a hearing, and our Nation put tothe trouble and expence to &s;end Lawyers out of the Kingdom to defend them&s;elves before tho&s;e that had al|ready condemned them. And &s;ince this is a vi&s;ible effect of the Union of the Crowns, by which we are every day more and more oppre&s;&s;ed; let them &s;peak their Con&s;ciences, if we have not all the rea|&s;on in the World to di&s;&s;olve that Union, except the Nations be more clo&s;ely united, and upon a better footing.</P>
<P>That we were &s;o treated in former Reigns, we had no great cau&s;e to wonder, when the Court was engaged in a Con&s;piracy again&s;t our Religion and Liberties. And our Nation being inferior to none in their Zeal for both, it was but natural to think that we &s;hould be the fir&s;t Sacrifice: But to be treated thus by a Prince who hath ventur'd his Life to &s;ave us from Popery and Slavery; a Prince who for Courage in War, and Conduct in Peace, is not to be match'd in Story; a Prince who is under God the Great Champion of our Religion, and the bold A&s;&s;erter of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Liberty; a Prince who&s;e Family we revere, and who&s;e Per&s;on we a|dore; a Prince for whom we have &s;o chearfully ventur'd our Lives, and lo&s;t &s;o much of the be&s;t Blood in our Veins; to be &s;o treated by &s;uch a Prince hath &s;ome thing cutting beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and proves that our Di&s;a&s;ters are no way to be re|medied, but either by a total Separation, or a clo&s;er Union of the two Kingdoms.</P>
<P>We cannot be &s;o unju&s;t to his Maje&s;ty's Charac|ter as to think a Prince of his Magnanimity could be guilty of &s;o mean a thing as willingly to &s;ub|ject the Crown of his Antient Kingdom which he received free, to that of another. We cannot once &s;uffer it to enter into our thoughts, that he who dares to out-brave Death in the Field a thou|&s;and
<PB N="41" REF="81">times a day, &s;hould act &s;o unworthy a part as fir&s;t to condemn, and then to try us. The&s;e and all other things of that &s;ort we mu&s;t needs charge to the account of our Enemies about him, who mi&s;repre&s;ent us, and therefore &s;urpri&s;e his Maje&s;ty into any thing he does again&s;t us.</P>
<P>As to that po&s;itive Sentence of our having acted contrary to the Peace betwixt his Maje&s;ty and his Allies, we have all the Rea&s;on in the World to complain of it. Is our Kingdom then become &s;o mean and contemptible, that what is tran&s;acted according to the Acts of our Parliaments, and Pa|tents of our Kings, is liable to be annull'd, or de|clared illegal, by any Per&s;on that has the hap to be made an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Secretary of State, Governor of one of their <HI>American</HI> Plantations, or a Member of their Council of Trade? If it be &s;o, his Ma|je&s;ty's Dignity, as King of <HI>Scots,</HI> is well defended in the mean time, when it is liable thus to be tram|pled upon by his own Servants as King of <HI>England.</HI> This does indeed veri&s;y what has been &s;aid, that our Kings &s;ince the Union leave their Anti|ent Kingdom to the di&s;po&s;al of their Ser|vants: but whether this be agreeable to the Co|ronation Oaths of our Kings, let them determine that are concern'd to enquire; and perhaps it may be worth the con&s;ideration of our Neighbours, whether &s;ince we have been govern'd by Servants, they have not for the mo&s;t part been &s;ubject to Mini|ons, and that the one does naturally pave the way for the other. So that they are no great gainers by the Bargain.</P>
<P>If it be an&s;wer'd, that the Proclamations are i&s;&s;ued by his Maje&s;ty's Authority, and that there|fore our Sentence proceeds from his Bar.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, 1. That there are &s;hrewd Su&s;pitions that a certain Gentleman or two who have af|fected
<PB N="42" REF="82">all along to &s;hew their Zeal again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> in this Affair, have pu&s;h'd this matter beyond their In&s;tructions; for there's no man that knows his Ma|je&s;ty's Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom, can admit a thought that he would condemn us before we were heard.</P>
<P N="2">2. We don't at all que&s;tion his Maje&s;ty's Au|thority as King of <HI>England,</HI> to forbid his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects to give any manner of A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Darien</HI> (tho we might &s;ay it was unkind) but we ab&s;olutely deny that he has any Authority as King of <HI>England</HI> to condemn the Proceedings of the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> for any thing they tran&s;|act without the Dominions of <HI>England.</HI> If it be otherwi&s;e, his Maje&s;ty, as King of <HI>Scots,</HI> is bound to appear at the <HI>King's-Bench-bar</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> for what he hath done as King of <HI>Scots,</HI> upon the Lord Chief Ju&s;tices Summons; and of what Con&s;equence this may be to him&s;elf or his Succe&s;&s;ors, may be ea&s;ily judg'd. Had <HI>Oliver,</HI> and the other Regicides, bethought them&s;elves of this, it had been more for the Honour of <HI>England,</HI> and would have taken off a great deal of the odium that is charg'd upon them for cutting off King <HI>Charles,</HI> had they &s;earch'd for &s;omething Criminal in his Conduct toward the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation as King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and condemned him for that. Tho they did not think upon this, perhaps others may; and then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will be able to ju&s;tify them&s;elves as not having cut off their own King, but their Enemy the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> as there's no doubt they would have done by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had he not made his e&s;cape after the battel of <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>This may perhaps de&s;erve the thoughts of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty and others concern'd in the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, and &s;o much the more that the depen|dence of the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon that of <HI>England</HI> hath been lately a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="82">Hi&s;torians, and indirectly hinted at in a pre|tended An&s;wer to the <HI>Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>Settlement at</HI> Darien, p. 24.</P>
<P>But to &s;atisfy that Gentleman and others, who plea&s;e them&s;elves &s;o much in vilifying the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation, they may turn to the Reigns of <HI>Edward</HI> I. II. &amp; III. and they will quickly find that Sir <HI>Wil|liam Wallace,</HI> K. <HI>Robert Bruce, James</HI> Lord <HI>Doug|las, Thomas Randolph</HI> Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and others that we could name, did &s;o gallantly defend the Soveraignty of <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e bold Pre|tenders to a Superiority over us, that their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors have had no great &s;tomach to pur&s;ue their Claim to it &s;ince: So that if ever they had any, it is forfeited by Pre&s;cription.</P>
<P><HI>Oliver</HI>'s imaginary Conque&s;t &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by the dull An&s;werer of the <HI>Scots</HI> Defence, and o|thers, will be of no u&s;e to the Faction in this matter, &s;ince that was no National Quarrel, nor did the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pretend to any &s;uch thing, as a Conque&s;t of us, but immediatly withdrew their Forces upon the Re&s;toration. So that <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Conque&s;t, as he calls it, was only the Victory of one Party over another in a Civil War, it being well known that he had Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> as well as <HI>England,</HI> which (if that Wi&s;e Author will have <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Victories to be Conque&s;ts) he had conquer<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">d too before ever he came near <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We don't in&s;i&s;t upon this with any de&s;ign to de|rogate from the Valour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, which is known all over the World, but to &s;top the mouths of tho&s;e pitiful Scriblers, and to give a <HI>Caveat</HI> to tho&s;e Gentlemen about Court, who talk &s;o big of conquering <HI>Scotland</HI> upon this pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>But we wi&s;h them to con&s;ult beforehand how <HI>England</HI> in general &s;tands affected to &s;uch a De|&s;ign,
<PB N="44" REF="83">and how they will ju&s;tify the Lawfulne&s;s of it, le&s;t it fare with them as it did with K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. and his Cabal, who not only in Council advis'd, TO REDUCE US TO OUR DUTY BY FORCE RATHER THAN GIVE WAY TO OUR DEMANDS, as may be &s;een in the <HI>Repre&s;entation of the States of</HI> Scotland in 1640. but rais'd Money, and levied a formidable Army to carry on their De&s;ign; and yet the Hearts of the&s;e Bravos fail'd them when they came in view of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who repuls'd them twice with &s;hame, the fir&s;t time when they encamp'd their great Army near <HI>Barwick,</HI> and the next when we charg'd them at <HI>Newburn.</HI> And at la&s;t the be&s;t of the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> thought fit to put a &s;top to tho&s;e dangerous Proceedings, and follow'd his Ma|je&s;ty with a Prote&s;tation again&s;t them, as well knowing, that if <HI>Scotland</HI> were once &s;ubdued, the Liberties of <HI>England</HI> could not be long liv'd.</P>
<P>That it is the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> now to prevent the Ruin of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as much as it was then, will appear by the following Arguments.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs makes it nece&s;&s;ary for the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> rather to &s;trengthen them&s;elves by making new Friends than by procuring new Enemies. They are not ignorant that they have a controverted Title to their Crown entail'd upon them, and that the Pre|tenders again&s;t tho&s;e in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion are in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and under their Protection. Nor can they be ignorant, that to the old National Hatred betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have added that of the Prote&s;tant Religion. Of late years they have declared them&s;elves the mo&s;t implacable Enemies of it; and their King in all his Triumphs has that a&s;crib'd to him as his greate&s;t Exploit, that he hath quelled the Mon&s;ter of Here&s;y. The ca&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="83">being thus, it mu&s;t needs be again&s;t the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to &s;uffer any froward and head&s;trong Facti|on to embroil them with <HI>Scotland,</HI> or to ruin that Kingdom; the Con&s;equence of which will be the expo&s;ing them&s;elves as an ea&s;ier Prey to the Con|que&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> or any other Enemy.
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> had a hand in fomenting our late Civil Wars, and made u&s;e of their Firebrands in all Parties, is beyond di&s;pute; and that it is now more their Intere&s;t to divide us than ever, is &s;o palpable that it cannot be denied. Nothing in human probability could have &s;top'd the impetuous Current of their Arms, but the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and therefore it concerns them, both in point of Intere&s;t and Revenge, to da&s;h us again&s;t one another: and if the ill U&s;age that we meet with from the Court of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould force us a|gain into a <HI>French</HI> or other Alliance, the World cannot blame us; &s;ince the Laws of Nature and Nations are for us. Put the ca&s;e that a &s;maller num|ber of Chri&s;tians &s;hould be unju&s;tly attack'd by a greater, whom nothing will &s;atisfy but the utter Ruin of the former: Could any man in con&s;cience blame the weaker Party to call in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Jews</HI> and Pagans to pre&s;erve their own Lives? Is it not the &s;ame ca&s;e with the <HI>Scots?</HI> have they not ever &s;ince the Union of the Crowns been oppre&s;&s;ed and tyranniz'd over by a Faction in <HI>England,</HI> who will neither admit of an Union of the Nations, nor leave the <HI>Scots</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own Privi|leges, as Men and Chri&s;tians? Was it not a Party in <HI>England</HI> that impos'd upon us fir&s;t in Matters of Religion? Did we &s;end fir&s;t to oblige them to &s;ub|mit to the <HI>Geneva</HI> Di&s;ciplin, as they call it; or was it they that fir&s;t impo&s;ed their Ceremonies and Forms of Prayer upon us? Was it we who fir&s;t in|vaded them with an Army to &s;ubvert their Civil and
<PB N="46" REF="84">Religious Liberties, or did not they fir&s;t invade us? Was it we who fir&s;t made Acts again&s;t their Trade, or they who made Acts de&s;tructive of ours? Did we i&s;&s;ue Proclamations again&s;t their Colonies, or have they done &s;o by ours? In the name of God then let them declare what they would have us to do. They will not unite with us, nor &s;uffer us to live by our &s;elves: Nor mu&s;t we have any &s;hare of their Trade, or carry on a Trade by our &s;elves. Is it not plain then that the Faction oppre&s;s us? and yet we mu&s;t not complain of this &s;ort of Treat|ment.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If the State of Affairs in <HI>Ireland</HI> be con&s;ider'd, it will appear to be &s;uch, as may make it dange|rous to &s;uffer the <HI>Scots</HI> to be oppre&s;&s;ed and pro|vok'd in this manner It is well enough known that the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> are not very well pleas'd with their Treatment by &s;ome in <HI>England.</HI> This, together with the great numbers of <HI>Scots</HI> in the North of that Kingdom, who bear a natural Af|fection to their Country, and would be very unea&s;y to &s;ee its Ruin, may prove of dangerous con&s;e|quence, in ca&s;e of a Rupture with <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It will further appear to be the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> not to &s;uffer the <HI>Scots</HI> to be &s;o much run down, if they con&s;ider the po&s;ture of their own Affairs at home. The Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;i|ties betwixt the &s;everal Parties in <HI>England</HI> are well enough known: So that be&s;ides the Sport it would afford to the common Enemy of our Re|ligion and Country, to &s;ee tho&s;e two Nations en|gaged in War, the Enemies of the pre&s;ent Go|vernment would be &s;ure to improve it, and watch for an opportunity to avenge them&s;elves for what has been done again&s;t the late K. <HI>James,</HI> and his Friends. It is well enough known what hopes they and &s;ome People beyond Sea conceive from the
<PB N="47" REF="84">Differences that this Treatment of the <HI>Scots</HI> may probably occa&s;ion; and as they have an irrecon|cilable Hatred again&s;t our Nation, becau&s;e we de|clar'd &s;o generally again&s;t the late King, and are &s;o zealous for his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, there's no doubt but they will foment our Divi&s;ions as much as they can, and in&s;inuate them&s;elves with both Parties, in order to &s;et them together by the Ears. They know that &s;o many as fall in <HI>England</HI> of tho&s;e who adhere to the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, and &s;o many as fall in <HI>Scotland</HI> for &s;upporting the Trade and Free|dom of their Country, &s;o many Enemies they are rid of; therefore there's no que&s;tion but they pro|mi&s;e them&s;elves a plentiful fi&s;hing in &s;uch troubled Waters.
<P>It likewi&s;e de&s;erves the con&s;ideration of our Neighbours, that they don't &s;tand at pre&s;ent in very good terms as to matter of Trade with <HI>France, Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> nor is it well known what the I&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y with <HI>Spain</HI> about regulating their Succe&s;&s;ion may be. The im|pending differences betwixt the Northern Crowns may perhaps in a little time imbroil them with one or other of them, and affect their Trade al&s;o on that &s;ide. All which being con&s;ider'd, it would &s;eem to be the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to a&s;&s;ure them|&s;elves of the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Scots,</HI> by treating them in a kind and neighbourly manner.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It will appear in particular not to be the Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters and &s;ober Churchmen, that the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould be thus run down, becau&s;e their own Ruin will be the unavoidable Con&s;e|quence of it. This they may &s;oon be convinc'd of if they will give them&s;elves leave to con&s;ider how they were treated in K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t's time, when the Court did &s;well with &s;o much Rage again&s;t the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> for a&s;&s;erting their Liber|ties
<PB N="48" REF="85">then, as they do now. All tho&s;e Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>-men that could not conform to the Innovati|ons brought into the Church by <HI>Laud</HI> and his Party, were treated as Puritans and Schi&s;maticks; and tho&s;e that appear'd for the Liberties of the Nati|on again&s;t the Ship-money and other Arbitrary Impo&s;itions of the Court, were treated as Rebels and Traitors. If they look into the two la&s;t Reigns, it will appear as plain as the Sun, that when <HI>Scot|tand</HI> was oppre&s;s'd, and their Liberties wre&s;ted from them, the Di&s;&s;enters and moderate Church|men in <HI>England</HI> were brought under the la&s;h: the former were depriv'd of their Religion and Liber|ties, and the latter expos'd to de&s;truction by Sham-plots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e of their appearing for the Laws of their Country. We need mention no more In&s;tances to put this out of Controver&s;y, than tho&s;e deplorable ones of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el;</HI> to which we may add the &s;hameful and barbarous Treatment of the worthy Mr. <HI>John|&s;on</HI> Chaplain to the latter, becau&s;e he &s;o excellent|ly defended with his Pen the Birth-right and Free|dom of all true Engli&s;hmen.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>From all this it will appear that <HI>England</HI> in gene|ral mu&s;t &s;uffer by the Ruin of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that tho&s;e who have all along &s;tood up for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liber|ties, mu&s;t lay their Account to come under the la&s;h, if once our Necks come under the Yoke: therefore we dare appeal to the &s;ober Men of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Whether it be their Intere&s;t that a Nation which agrees with them in all the Articles of their Church, tho&s;e about Di&s;cipline excepted, &s;hould be de&s;tin'd to ruin, becau&s;e we believe with mo&s;t of the Reformed Churches, that there is no Office &s;uperiour to that of a Presbyter of divine In&s;titution. Mu&s;t we be denied the Pri|vileges of Men and Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e we think
<PB N="49" REF="85">that the Di&s;cipline of the Church may be more &s;afely intru&s;ted, and more faithfully admini&s;tred by the joint Indeavors of the Mini&s;ter and the Heads of his Congregation, by an A&s;&s;ociation of neighbouring Mini&s;ters, and the Heads of their Pari&s;hes, and by Delegates both of the Clergy and Laity of tho&s;e A&s;&s;ociations in a general Convocati|on, than by another Model? But enough of this Subject. Let any Man peru&s;e the learned Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>&V;&s;her</HI>'s Treati&s;e of <HI>Presbytery and Epi&s;copacy reconcil'd,</HI> and there they will find that the diffe|rence is not &s;o great as &s;ome People have made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to make the World believe. But if nothing le&s;s than our de&s;truction will &s;erve tho&s;e Gentlemen, becau&s;e our Church is of a different Con&s;titution from that of <HI>England,</HI> and that our political Principles and original Con&s;titu|tion are diametrically oppo&s;ite to arbitrary Power, let the Di&s;&s;enters of <HI>England,</HI> and all tho&s;e Church|men that concurr'd in the late Revolution, look to it. When their Neighbour's Hou&s;e is on &s;ire it's time for them to prepare their Bucket's. If this Digre&s;&s;ion be thought impertinent, <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and the An&s;werer of the <HI>Scots</HI> Defence mu&s;t bear the blame of it. They would in&s;inuate to the World that the Affair of our Trade and Colony is a Presbyterian Project, on purpo&s;e to render it odious and &s;u&s;pected to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to obviate that fal&s;e and malicious Sugge&s;tion, and to acquaint our Neigh|bours that the Company make no difference as to the matter of Per&s;wa&s;ion: and let it be put to the Te&s;t when they plea&s;e, it will be found that tho&s;e of the Epi&s;copal Opinion are as zealous for the thriving of our Trade, and the Honour of our Nation (both of which are concern'd in this Affair) as any of the other.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="86">
<P>To wind up this matter, if any Party in <HI>Eng|land</HI> entertain &s;u&s;picions of us, the better way to prevent us is to treat us kindly, and enter into an Union with us on &s;uch Terms as his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament of both Kingdoms &s;hall agree, and &s;o as the Civil and Religious Liberties of both People may be pre&s;erved. That will be ca&s;ier and &s;afer than to relie on the Hopes of an uncertain Conque&s;t; or if they don't think fit to do &s;o, it's but rea&s;onable they &s;hould leave us in the undi|&s;turb'd po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our own Liberties: But if they will do neither, let them no more accu&s;e tho&s;e that complain of this Treatment as Incen|diaries, but &s;eriou&s;ly examine whether they them|&s;elves mayn't with more Ju&s;tice be accounted Op|pre&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>WE come in the next place to take a Survey of <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> Libel, intituled, <HI>The Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>abdicating</HI> Darien; and &s;hall &s;peedily &s;hew to how little purpo&s;e his Suborners have &s;pent their Pains and Mony on him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Line of his Performance is a Banter upon his Maje&s;ty, whom he charges with <HI>inve&s;ting our Company with immen&s;e Privileges and Immuni|ties by his Octroy of</HI> 1695. There's no Man can be an&s;werable for more &s;en&s;e than God has given him; but tho <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> under&s;tood no better, his Ma&s;ters at <HI>White-hall,</HI> of whom he brags &s;o much, ought to have taken care that he &s;hould not run into Non&s;en&s;e, and an Invective again&s;t his Maje&s;ty at fir&s;t da&s;h: To talk of granting us <HI>immen&s;e Privileges,</HI> is to impeach his Maje&s;ty's Wi&s;dom, as if he had done a thing without paral|lel, which is directly to incen&s;e the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t him, as &s;ome bad People indea|vour'd to do, when by a Mi&s;repre&s;entation of our De&s;ign, they &s;tir'd up the Hou&s;e of Commons a|gain&s;t it. But had the Surgeon or his suborners look'd into the Privileges of 21 Years freedom from all manner of Taxes granted to the Dutch <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company by the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the va&s;t Immunities granted by the French King, the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> to their Companies for trading to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> or even

<P>But if <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborners exclaim again&s;t our Privileges as immen&s;e, they are re&s;olv'd to dimini&s;h the Authority by which they were grant|ed, and call it only by the name of an <HI>Octroy,</HI> which &s;ignifies no more than a Patent; whereas our Privileges were granted us by an Act of Par|liament, which are greater and more &s;acred than all the <HI>Octroys</HI> in <HI>Europe:</HI> Thus thro Ignorance or Ma|lice they think fit to vilify his Maje&s;ty's Conduct and Authority, which they pretend to defend.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="88">upbraid the Company with their blind Project, at which the trading part of the World &s;tand amaz'd; yet <HI>p.</HI> 17. they tell us that the Project was rea|&s;onable both on the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Hamburghers</HI> &s;ide; and the Rea&s;ons they give are the&s;e, <HI>That the River on which that City &s;tands is navigable for</HI> 200 <HI>Miles up into</HI> Germany <HI>for flat-bottom'd Ve&s;&s;els of</HI> 70 <HI>or</HI> 80 <HI>Tuns,</HI> which gives them an opportunity of &s;erving all the North Parts of the Empire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All that they can &s;ay to &s;alve this Contradiction is, <HI>That the</HI> Hamburghers <HI>knew nothing of</HI> Darien, <HI>but builded altogether on Ships laden with</HI> India <HI>Goods;</HI> but that's a notorious Fal&s;hood, for the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> were actually told that our De&s;ign was on the I&s;thmus of <HI>America,</HI> and therefore could not be di&s;appointed in their Expectations of an <HI>East-India</HI> Trade if they had a mind to have follow'd it, &s;ince they could not be ignorant that they had thereby an opportunity of &s;hortning the Voyage from <HI>Darien</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> But at the &s;ame time it is much to be que&s;tion'd whether the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> were &s;o intent upon an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, as <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> al|ledges, &s;ince it mu&s;t vi&s;ibly prejudice their own Manufacture of Linen.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI> with one Ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> that he tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 14. That one of the Rea&s;ons why the <HI>Dutch</HI> were &s;o much taken with our <HI>Ea&s;t-Indian</HI> Trade, was our Exemption from Duties for 21 years; which &s;erves only to di&s;cover his own Folly and Malice, &s;ince every Body mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily know, that exemption from Duties was only in the Sco|ti&s;h Ports; &s;o that if they were exported from thence into any other Country, they mu&s;t pay the &s;ame Duties in tho&s;e Countries, as if they had been directly imported from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Incon&s;i&s;tency of <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Subor|ners
<PB N="55" REF="88">is further demon&s;trated, <HI>p.</HI> 4. <HI>by&s;uppo&s;ing our buying a couple of &s;econd-hand Ships in the</HI> Thames, <HI>and di&s;patching them to</HI> India <HI>with a &s;utable Cargo.</HI> As to the buying of &s;econd-hand Ships, the Company made that Experiment, but found them&s;elves lo&s;evs by it, and that it co&s;t them more to fit up a &s;econd|hand Ve&s;&s;el for their purpo&s;e, than it would have done to have bought a new one. But with what Front can they upbraid us with not buying of Ships in the <HI>Thames</HI> for carrying on an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, when they own, <HI>p.</HI> 7. <HI>that the Hou&s;e of Commons baulk'd us of our Sub&s;criptions, and repri|manded the Subjects of</HI> England <HI>for their foolery?</HI> How is it po&s;&s;ible then that they would have &s;uf|fer'd our buying Ships in the <HI>Thames</HI> for carrying on an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade?</P>
<P>We have another proof of his Ingenuity and Truth in that &s;ame Page, where he tells us, that if <HI>our blind Project (meaning that of</HI> Darien) <HI>&s;hould mi&s;|carry by our own ill Management, it is not fair we &s;hould &s;narl at our Neighbours, who have no other Hand in our Misfortune, than that they would not be acce&s;&s;ary to any Act which the World might judg Felonious, and wherein they could not join without en|gaging them&s;elves in an unrea&s;onable War, and in the end to a&s;&s;i&s;t us with Weapons to break our won Heads.</HI> We wi&s;h his Ma&s;ters much joy of their Advocat and Evidence, for we believe they could not have found &s;uch another if they had &s;earched through all the I&s;land: He ju&s;t now own'd that our Neigh|bours oppo&s;ed our Sub&s;criptions at home and a|broad, before they knew any thing of what he calls <HI>our blind Project,</HI> and made us &s;quander away 50000 <HI>l</HI> to little purpo&s;e, whioh certainly mu&s;t be a <HI>misfortune,</HI> and that wherein our Neighbours had no &s;mall hand, tho the World could not judg our taking Sub&s;criptions in that Honourable
<PB N="56" REF="89">manner to be any way Felonious. We have more|over &s;ufficently proved it el&s;ewhere, that they have had a hand in our Misfortune by down-right oppo&s;ition, and unaccountable Proclamations for which they had no Authority; we hope that this will be allow'd to be &s;omething more than refu&s;ing to be acce&s;&s;ary to an Act that neither he nor his Suborners will ever be able to prove Felonious, and which we have already told him, the Laws of <HI>Eng|land</HI> have in a parallel, nay much wor&s;e ca&s;e, judg'd to be hone&s;t and righteous.</P>
<P>So that all this Author hath got by his charging us maliciou&s;ly with Felony, is to prove him&s;elf a wilful Felon, for he tells us at the end of his Book of a long di&s;pute betwixt him&s;elf and Sir <HI>J. Stewart</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Advocat for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a|bout the Title of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to <HI>Darien;</HI> and if we may believe <HI>H&mdash;s,</HI> he baffled the Advocat, and prov'd the Right of the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> which proves him&s;elf to have engaged in a De&s;ign that he thought Felonious, for we do not find, by his own Relation, that he left the place from remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, but only on the Account of a <HI>Malladie Imaginaire,</HI> and want of Provi&s;ions; &s;o that we thank him for telling the World, from his own Mouth, that his Evidence again&s;t us is that of a Felon.</P>
<P>As to their engaging them&s;elves in an unrea|&s;onable War, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting us with Weapons to break their own Heads; we did not de&s;ire they &s;hould engage in a War for us, but think it very unrea&s;onable the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court &s;hould have engaged &s;o far as they have done again&s;t us: It had been &s;ufficient for them to have denied us their A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, without having condemn'd us as guilty of breach of Alliance, which, as all the other parts of the oppo&s;ition made to us, we are &s;atisfied is
<PB N="57" REF="89">not the Act of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and therefore can create no mi&s;under&s;tanding betwixt them and us, but perhaps may prove a Weapon in time to break the Heads of <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborners.</P>
<P>In the 5th Page, that his Book may be all of a piece, he advances a forg'd Obligation upon us, from the Union of the Crowns, which is, that we are thereby <HI>deliver'd from the daily Feuds and bloody little Wars that rag'd among&s;t us for</HI> 1900 <HI>years, which unnatural Ma&s;&s;acnes our native Princes were unable to &s;uppre&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. This is down-right fal&s;hood in mat|ter of Fact; for tho&s;e Feuds, as he calls them, ceas'd in the <HI>Lowlands</HI> long before the Union, but conti|nue &s;till in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> which we can &s;carocly think is unknown to our Author who was born &s;o near that Country as <HI>Dumbarton.</HI> The <HI>Macdonalds</HI> have been &s;everal times in Arms again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> &s;ince the Re&s;toration, and there's a Fend now depending between the <HI>Frazers</HI> and the <HI>Murrays,</HI> or rather the Family of <HI>Athol.</HI> Non did we ever hear of any thing that look'd &s;o like an unnatural Ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Scotland</HI> as that committed &s;ince tho Revolution upon the Inhabitants of <HI>Glenco,</HI> which had it not been for the Union of the Crowns, would not have been &s;uffer'd to go unpuni&s;hed. But admitting it to be true, that the Union had deliver'd us from tho&s;e little Feuds, we are no gainers by the Bargain, &s;ince it hath occa&s;ion'd greater; pavticularly that unnatural Feud which rag'd &s;o long betwixt the Epi&s;copal Party and Pre&s;|byterians, and had its ri&s;e altogether from the Union of the Crowns; the very pro&s;pect of which, was the &s;ole cau&s;e why the Earl of <HI>Morton</HI> (when Regent) &s;et up the fir&s;t Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hops in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>Into what Couvul&s;ions that Impo&s;ition threw the Nation is well enough known; and how be&s;ides the
<PB N="58" REF="90">bringing down K <HI>Charles</HI> I. with 30000 Men again&s;t our Kingdom, and contributing to engage the Na|tions in a Civil War, it occa&s;ioned King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to plunder the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> fir&s;t by Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> which gave ri&s;e to the In&s;urrection at <HI>Pentland;</HI> and twice afterwards by the <HI>Highland</HI> Ho&s;t, which occa&s;ion'd that of <HI>Bothwel-Bridg:</HI> And afterwards the Oppre&s;&s;ion run &s;o high, that it forc'd &s;ome of the Presbyterians into unaccounta|ble Actions, which gave occa&s;ion to oppre&s;s the whole Party; &s;o that it was made puni&s;hable by Death for any of their Mini&s;ters to preach, or for the People to hear them. From this indeed, we were totally delivered by the Revolution, tho our freedom in that re&s;pect was partly begun by the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Declaration. But our Enemies, unwilling that our Nation &s;hould be long at ea&s;e, have found other Methods to &s;et our Court again&s;t us: And becau&s;e they know that his pre&s;ent Maje|&s;ty has too great a Soul to per&s;ecute any man on the account of Con&s;cience; our Enemies have chang'd their Battery, and in&s;tead of pointing their Cannon at our Religion, they level them again&s;t our Civil Liberties. The Powder they prime their Artillery with, is, That <HI>we are Enemies to Preroga|tive:</HI> But becau&s;e this would not go down with the good People of <HI>England,</HI> who are &s;trenuous A&s;&s;er|tors of Liberty and Property, they mu&s;t gild it o|ver with the &s;pecious Pretence, that we have a de|&s;ign to undermine their Trade, and have unju&s;tly invaded the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions. This is the De&s;ign of <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborners; and therefore they in|&s;i&s;t &s;o much on our Clande&s;tine Declarations, as they call them, that we publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, on purpo&s;e to drain them of their People; but unhappily overthrow what they ad|vance at the &s;ame time, when they tell us, That
<PB N="59" REF="90"><HI>the</HI> Jamaica <HI>Sloops were Witne&s;&s;es that we had neither Provi&s;ions, nor Money for the &s;u&s;tenance of our own People,</HI> pag. 148. And therefore it cannot rea&s;ona|bly be &s;uppos'd that we had any &s;uch de&s;ign as he malicioufly charges us with, to draw over the Peo|ple from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, &s;ince we had not wherewith to &s;upport our own; but more of this anon. Our Author learn'd the Maxim of <HI>Calum|niare audacter &amp; aliquid barebit,</HI> when he was a Pa|pi&s;t: And if he and his Suborners can be any way in&s;trumental to &s;et the Nations together by the Ears by this Method; or if that fail, if they can but rai&s;e Animo&s;itys between them, they know it will be a good pretence for &s;ome people to put his Maje&s;ty upon pre&s;&s;ing for a Standing Army, and perhaps for having it enlarg'd, it being nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ay they, to overaw the <HI>Scors,</HI> but in reality to pro|tect &s;uch evil Coun&s;ellors from being brought to Ju&s;tice, that have advis'd to &s;uch Mea&s;ures as vi&s;i|bly tend to the di&s;advantage of both Nations.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be worth the Enquiry of our Neighbours whether this be not the real meaning of this intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ion exercis'd upon our Nation as to their Trade both at home and abroad, <HI>viz.</HI> that knowing our <HI>prafervidum. Ingenium,</HI> as they are pleas'd to call it, to be impatient under Tyranny, the Faction think thereby to provoke us to a re&s;entment that may give occa&s;ion for rai&s;ing an Army again&s;t us; which if it have the good hap to &s;ubdue us, or force us to dige&s;t our Oppre&s;|&s;lon without any more to do, &s;hall be made u&s;e of afterwards to cha&s;ti&s;e them&s;elves, and bring them to better Manners, then to limit their Monarchs in their Grants, and leave them no other Troops but their Gari&s;ons and Guards. It was the Ob&s;er|valton of the Earl of <HI>Sha&s;tsbury,</HI> whom his Ene|mies will own to have been a great State&s;man, that
<PB N="60" REF="91"><HI>Scotland</HI> is a Door to let in Good or Evil upon <HI>Eng|land;</HI> which is verified in the latter at lea&s;t by the whole Cour&s;e of our Hi&s;tory &s;ince the Union: for when K. <HI>James</HI> I. &s;ucceeded in trampling upon us, he quickly began to huff his Parliaments in <HI>England;</HI> and notwith&s;tanding all the Remon&s;tran|ces of Church and State, would needs have a Po|pi&s;h Match for his Son, tho he &s;hould &s;acrifice the Great Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> his own Daughter the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and her Children, together with the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>Germany,</HI> to make way for it. When <HI>Charles</HI> I. obtain'd footing for his. Impo&s;itions on the Church and State of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> it's well enough known what Methods he took with <HI>England,</HI> and how he &s;acrific'd the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> whil&s;t he eagerly pur&s;ued an Arbitrary Sway at home. When <HI>Charles</HI> II. got his Prerogative exalted, and an Army at his Call allow'd him in <HI>Scotland,</HI> i'ts too late to be forgotten how he trod under foot the Liberties of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eiz'd the Charters of their Cities, cut off whom he would by Sham-Plots, and pav'd the way for Popery and Arbitrary Power. When K. <HI>James</HI> II. did by his ab&s;olute Power and unaccountable Au|thority ca&s;s and annul all the Laws e&s;tabli&s;hing the Reformation in <HI>Sootland;</HI> it was not long e're he &s;u&s;|pended the Laws, impri&s;on'd the Bi&s;hops, and fill'd with Papi&s;ts his Council, Army, and Univer&s;ities in <HI>England.</HI> From all which it is evident that our Neighbours have rea&s;on to look to them&s;elves when we are oppre&s;s'd; for in all probability their Acts of Parliament will not be long regarded, when ours are annull'd and made void by the Intrigues of the Courtiers, and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Proclamations. The very Advocats of Tyranny make u&s;e of this as their <HI>Herculean</HI> Argument, That the People hav|ing once re&s;ign'd their Privileges to the Crown,
<PB N="61" REF="91">have no more right to demand them; which tho we will not allow to be any ways concluding, yet we may very well make u&s;e of it <HI>ad hominem,</HI> that <HI>a pari ratione,</HI> when once a Prince has touch'd with his Scepter a Law for the benefit of his Subjects, it is not in his power to revoke or counteract it; or if he do, by the &s;ame Power that he ab&s;olves him&s;elf from his Obligation to protect and defend his Sub|jects, he ab&s;olves them from all obligation to pay him any Revenue or Allegiance. This is the Birth|right of all <HI>Scots</HI>-men; and if our Neighbours in <HI>England</HI> have a mind to &s;it &s;till, and fee us bereft of it, all the benefit they can expect from it, is to have the Privilege of being devour'd la&s;t.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his Banter upon his native Country &s;erves only to le&s;&s;en his own credit, and to make even tho&s;e that &s;et him at work, cur&s;e him in thought, not only as a Mon&s;ter in nature, but as di&s;hone&s;t to them, by depriving them thus of the benefit of his Evidence, for which they have paid him &s;o well; &s;ince no body in the world can think a man will have any regard to Truth, that in &s;uch an impudent manner breaks thro all the Ties of Nature; and as a ju&s;t Judgment for &s;o enormous a Crime, is &s;o far depriv'd of his rea&s;oning Faculty, that he is not &s;en&s;ible of his cutting his own Throat, by contra|dicting him&s;elf almo&s;t in every Paragraph. He up|braids us in one Page with not having dar'd to de|&s;cend into the Plains, and that tho&s;e gallant Men our Ance&s;tors dur&s;t not a&s;&s;emble for Wor&s;hip be|fore the Union, except in a Hou&s;e who&s;e Wall was twelve or 14 foot thick, or to whi&s;per their Pray|ers or Carrols thro the Cliffs of the Mountains: In the next Page he tells us he has no Inclination to offer any thing in oppo&s;ition to the Gallantry of our Ance&s;tors; and in &s;ome Pages following he imper|tinently ridicules the Valour of our Country in the
<PB N="62" REF="92">Story of <HI>Baliol,</HI> which he perverts in &s;uch a manner, as no man but him&s;elf is capable of.</P>
<P>We don't think it worth while to an&s;wer him ac|cording to his Folly, but &s;hall once for all let him know, that the mo&s;t invective of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;to|rians, that wrote in the heat of the War, do us more Ju&s;tice than this unnatural Renegado. There's no Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> where we have not given proofs of our Valour, nor is there a Court in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> where <HI>Scots</HI>-men are not valued on that account. <HI>Sam. Daniel,</HI> one of the be&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;to|rians, owns that never any People of the World did more gallantly defend their Liberties than we did in that very in&s;tance of <HI>Baliol,</HI> when we were without a Head; and from thence infers, what was it we could not have done, had we been then under the conduct of &s;uch a Leader as K. <HI>Robert Bruce. Speed,</HI> one of the grave&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians, does generou&s;ly own, that few great Actions have been perform'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have not been with the fir&s;t and la&s;t in the Field.</P>
<P>We could ea&s;ily give a proper Reply to the im|pertinent Romance which he brings about <HI>Baliol,</HI> that would tend as much or more to the di&s;honour of <HI>Edward</HI> I. II. and III. than any thing that he and his Suborners have &s;ugge&s;ted can tend to the di&s;ho|nour of our Nation; but we forbear it, having no de&s;ign to reflect upon our Neighbours, notwith|&s;tanding the rude Treatment and Provocation that we have had from <HI>H&mdash;s,</HI> and others on this occa|&s;ion. We can, without thinking our &s;elves injur'd, own that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are as brave Men as any in the World, and are &s;atisfied, that &s;uch of our Neigh|bours as are Men of Honour and Reading, will al|low us the &s;ame Character. We perceive it is the de&s;ign of this Libeller and others to repre&s;ent the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation as Enemies to us in this matter, on
<PB N="63" REF="92">purpo&s;e to &s;et us together by the Ears; but we are &s;atisfied of the contrary, as well knowing that not a few of our good Neighbours are much &s;urpriz'd and di&s;pleas'd with our Treatment, and look upon the &s;ame to be the effect of &s;uch Councils as are de|&s;tructive to the Intere&s;t of both Nations.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this point with one Ob&s;ervation more upon <HI>H&mdash;s</HI>'s Ignorance and Malice, in de|nying that the <HI>Scots</HI> expell'd <HI>Baliol</HI> from the Crown, when &s;uch a noble Monument of the truth of it, as the original Letter of the States of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is &s;till to be &s;een in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and exemplify'd by Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> now Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of the Reformation; and &s;ince it is al&s;o plain that our Ance&s;tors cho&s;e <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> King during <HI>Baliol</HI>'s Life-time, and that <HI>Baliol</HI> at la&s;t re|&s;ign'd all his Preten&s;ions, confe&s;s'd his Fault in &s;ub|jecting the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> to that of <HI>England,</HI> own'd that he was de&s;ervedly thru&s;t from the Throne for it, congratulated his Kin&s;man <HI>Robert Bruce</HI>'s Advancement, and that he had re&s;tor'd the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> to its antient Honour.</P>
<P>We take no notice of his profane and athei&s;ti|cal Banter upon the Religion of our Country, as being &s;atisfied that that will do his Cau&s;e no good among&s;t thinking men, tho it may plea&s;e tho&s;e that he is only fit to conver&s;e with. As for his ma|licious charge on Presbyterians, that they maintain it as their Principle, <HI>That Dominion is founded on Grace;</HI> it's of a piece with the re&s;t of his Evi|dence. He and his Suborners will be very hard put to it to quote one of their Authors to prove the A&s;&s;ertion, and therefore they may well reject it as a &s;lander: but we mu&s;t tell him that if this be the Principle of the Presbyterians, they have not well an&s;wer'd it by their practice; for whenever they had any &s;uch thing as <HI>Dominion</HI> at their di&s;po|&s;al,

Was not their &s;olliciting a foreign Mini&s;ter to pre&s;ent a Me|morial again&s;t our Colony as &s;oon as ever the News of it arriv'd, another? And was not this the rea&s;on why they put it upon that Mini&s;ter, and not upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, that the latter had been forbid coming to Court, becau&s;e his Ca|tholick Maje&s;ty would not admit of <HI>Schonenburg</HI> the the <HI>Jew</HI> as Envoy from the <HI>Dutch?</HI> Were not the Enemies of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company &s;o zealous in pro|moting

<P>We dare refer it to the Scrutiny of the nice&s;t Ob&s;ervers, whether this Declaration infer any &s;uch thing as <HI>Plunder,</HI> or a Patent from the King to pick a Quarrel with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to divide the Spoil of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> what clande&s;tine Artifices are here to be found to drain the Engli&s;h Plantations, and wherein does it interfere with the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> any more than all free Ports mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity interfere with their Neighbours? We wi&s;h that our Author would inform us how publick Declarations according to Act of Parlia|ment can be call'd clande&s;tine Arti&s;ices, and defy him and his Suborners with all their art to find any thing pretended to in this Declaration, but what the Colony has a right to by Act of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>The only thing this malicious Scribler can wre&s;t to his Purpo&s;e in the Declaration, is the Colony's publi&s;hing that all manner of Per&s;ons, of what Na|tion or People &s;oever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be equally free, and alike capable of the &s;ame Privileges with them|&s;elves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are the expre&s;s Words of the Act of Parliament; and therefore &s;uppo&s;ing that the &s;aid Declaration &s;hould have influenc'd &s;ome People to come over to them from the Engli&s;h Plantations, the Colony could not be any ways blam'd for it. <HI>Qui utitur jure &s;uo nil damni facit,</HI> is a known Maxim in Maw.</P>
<P>The Libeller's Malice is not &s;atisfied with re|flecting upon our Colony, but flies on the face of the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> as if they had &s;o little Honour or Love for their native Country, as to lay their own Planta|tions de&s;olate, and run over to ours. Indeed if mo&s;t of them be &s;uch Per&s;ons as him&s;elf, there might be &s;ome ground for the Reflection; but till it appears to be &s;o, we mu&s;t beg Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;<HI>s</HI>'s
<PB N="71" REF="96">leave to have a better opinion of them. No Man of &s;en&s;e can believe that tho&s;e who found them|&s;elves at ea&s;e in the Engli&s;h Plantations, would be fond of removing to a new Colony; but if others who are at their freedom had a mind to do &s;o, we know of no rea&s;on they &s;hould be hinder'd. The Subjects of <HI>England</HI> are a free People, and not con|fin'd to their own Dominions, but have liberty to trade and live el&s;ewhere, if they find their account in it.</P>
<P>There's no man can blame the <HI>Scots</HI> for publi&s;h|ing their Declaration throughout the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the thing being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in it &s;elf, and the natural Practice of all new Settlements to ac|quaint the World with the nature of their De|&s;ign, and on what Terms they may have Com|merce with them. We hope our Author and his Suborners will not &s;ay that the Subjects of <HI>Eng|land</HI> might not have traded with them for their own advantage, provided their Title had been un|exceptionable: and &s;eeing the <HI>Scots</HI> had rea&s;on to think it &s;o, it was no act of unkindne&s;s in them to let the Engli&s;h Plantations know that they &s;hould be very welcome to trade to <HI>Darien;</HI> and how this could be done &s;o properly, and with &s;o much effect as by Declaration, our Author would do well to acquaint us.</P>
<P>The Gentleman and his Friends are very angry that we &s;hould have made u&s;e of the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Name to give the more Authority to the thing. We would very fain know their Rea&s;ons, why it is not as lawful for the <HI>Scots</HI> to make u&s;e of that Name as the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and at the &s;ame time mu&s;t take leave to tell the Renegado and his <HI>Whitehall</HI> Friends, that all this Venom they have &s;pit at the Scots Colony is a virulent In|vective again&s;t his Maje&s;ty. He impower'd them
<PB N="72" REF="97">to do what they accu&s;e them for by Act of Par|liament: and becau&s;e our Antagoni&s;ts have a mind to &s;ay that this <HI>Octroy,</HI> as they call it, was de|&s;tructive to the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> they find them|&s;elves oblig'd to make an Excu&s;e for the King, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>the hone&s;t Gentleman meant no harm at the grant|ing of it; for it is to be believ'd, that he could &s;carce bear what was whi&s;per'd for the noi&s;e of the</HI> Namur <HI>Guns,</HI> which is in plain Engli&s;h, he gave his con|&s;ent to he knew not what. A noble Defence, for which his Maje&s;ty is oblig'd to them! But Banter and Bla&s;phemy they were fully re&s;olv'd on; and &s;o they had but a Subject, they car'd not what. Nor <HI>Adam,</HI> nor <HI>David,</HI> nay nor the Almighty him&s;elf &s;hall e&s;cape them; but his Commi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> when they departed out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> mu&s;t come in to make up the profane Je&s;t: thus Heav<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">n it &s;elf &s;hall be charg'd at la&s;t with founding Domi|nion upon Grace, and giving the Elect a Divine Right to the Goods of the Wicked, after its being fir&s;t thrown as a killing Reflection at the Heads of the poor Presbyterians.</P>
<P><HI>H&mdash;s</HI> will needs in&s;i&s;t upon it in his Dedication, that our Project on <HI>Darien</HI> was &s;o &s;ecretly carried on, that it was not known to <HI>England</HI> till the &s;ame Wind that brought the News likewi&s;e inform'd the Nation that the <HI>Scots</HI> were march'd over to <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> and had planted 80 Guns again&s;t it; but un|happily forgets him&s;elf, and tells us, <HI>pag.</HI> 7. of his Book that <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> communicated it to &s;ome &s;elect Heads in <HI>England</HI> that were able to bear it. And we can tell him further, that it was &s;o well known to &s;ome in <HI>England,</HI> that they &s;ent Capt. <HI>Long</HI> the Quaker on purpo&s;e to prevent us, and to do us all the mi&s;chief he could; and accordingly he was on that Coa&s;t a month before us, tho he did not land any Men till afterwards. As for the news
<PB N="73" REF="97">of the <HI>Scots</HI> having planted 80 Cannon again&s;t <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> it's the fir&s;t time we ever heard on't, and therefore mu&s;t charge it upon the Author among&s;t the re&s;t of his Forgeries. There was indeed a Re|port brought over by the <HI>Dutch Gazetts,</HI> which we &s;uppo&s;e was in&s;erted on purpo&s;e by our good Friends in <HI>Holland</HI> to render us odious, that we had plundered <HI>Panama;</HI> but that was a long time after the news of our arrival at <HI>Darien,</HI> and fram'd on purpo&s;e, as we have rea&s;on to believe, to ju&s;tify the Proclamations that &s;ome Gentlemen at the We&s;t end of the Town had &s;ent to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> again&s;t us; for we know they can have what they plea&s;e put in the <HI>Dutch Gazetts,</HI> and that perhaps may be one main rea&s;on why they have been altogether &s;ilent as to the matter in their own.

<P><HI>Certainly the Work here begun is the mo&s;t ripened, dige&s;|ted, and the be&s;t founded, as to Privileges, Place, Time, and other like Advantages, that was ever yet begun in any part of the trading World. We arrived upon this Coa&s;t the fir&s;t, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the third of</HI> November: <HI>Our Situation is about two Leagues to the Southward of</HI> Gol|den-I&s;land <HI>(by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>called</HI> Guarda) <HI>in one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t defence able Harbours perhaps in the World. The Country is healthful to a wonder, in&s;omuch that our own Sick, which were many when we arrived, are now generally cured. The Country is exceeding fertil, and the Weather temperate: The Country where we are &s;ettled, is dry, and ri&s;ing ground, Hills but not high; and on the &s;ides, and quite to the tops, three, four or five foot good fat Mould, not a Rock or Stone to be &s;een. We have but eight or nine Leagues to a River, where Boats may go into the South-Sea. The Natives for fifty Leagues on either &s;ide are in intire friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence with us; and if we will be at the pains, we can gain tho&s;e at the greate&s;t di&s;tance. For our Neighbour</HI> Indians <HI>are willing to be the joyful Me&s;&s;engers of our Settlement, and good di&s;|po&s;ition to their Country-men. As to the innate Riches of the Country, upon the fir&s;t information, I always believ|ed it to be very great; but now find it goes beyond all that ever I thought, or conceited in that matter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Spaniards, <HI>as we can under&s;tand, are very much &s;urprized and alarm'd, and the more that it comes as a Thunder-clap upon them; having had no notice of us, until three days after our arrival.

<PB N="75" REF="98">and Corre&s;pondence; and if that is not conde&s;cended to, we are ready for what el&s;e he plea&s;es. If Merchants &s;hould once erect Factories here, this place will &s;oon become the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Mart in all</HI> America, <HI>both for In-land and Over-land Trade.

<P>Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborners may plea&s;e to know, that we neither de&s;ir'd nor expected that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould go to War with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the ac|count of our Company; and had as little rea&s;on to expect that a Faction in <HI>England</HI> (for we will not be &s;o unju&s;t as to charge it upon the Nation) &s;hould go to War with us on account of the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> before we could be heard in our own de|fence; we mean that Proclamations &s;hould have been publi&s;h'd in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> inferring that the King of <HI>England</HI> has a power to declare that to be a breach of the Peace that is done by the Authority of the King of <HI>Scotland;</HI> that they &s;hould thereby forbid their Subjects of <HI>England</HI> to entertain any Commerce with us, refu&s;e us Provi&s;ions for Commodities in our di&s;tre&s;s, except we will bring our Ships under the Guns of their Fort at <HI>New-York;</HI> puni&s;h their Subjects for enter|taining Commerce with us, and threatning to lay the Commanders of our Ships in Irons if they offer to put in for Refre&s;hment, or to refit after a Storm, as they did to Capt. <HI>Jami&s;on</HI> at <HI>Nevis.</HI> That this wants very little of going to War with the <HI>Scots,</HI> we believe mo&s;t thinking men are very well &s;atisfied; but whether it be &s;o or not, we will venture to tell the Renegado and his Subor|ners, that by this kind of Procedure again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> as if we were Servants and Subjects to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;ome Gentlemen in and about <HI>White-hall</HI> have giv'n the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ju&s;t occa&s;ion to make War upon <HI>England</HI> if they were able, or at lea&s;t to make Repri&s;als upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for the damage they pretend to have &s;uffer'd from the <HI>Scots,</HI> whom the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court by this &s;ort of Treatment have declar'd to be their Subjects; whereas if they had
<PB N="77" REF="99">not invaded the Soveraignty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could have had no &s;uch pretonce. Now whether men that had been endow'd with a quarter of an ounce of Politicks would have been guilty of &s;uch a fal&s;e &s;tep as this, let our Author's Sub|orners determine. And be&s;ides, we mu&s;t tell them, that the Men whom Capt. <HI>Long</HI> had &s;et a&s;hore with Capt. <HI>Diego</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Darien,</HI> committed the fir&s;t Ho&s;tility on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and kill'd &s;even of them, with a de&s;ign, for any thing we know, to trapan us into a War with the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> &s;ince one of the &s;ame Fellows came to our Colony afterwards for Powder and Shot, which our Men wi&s;ely deny'd them, and told them they had done what they could not ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>The Author of the Defence of the <HI>Scots</HI> Settle|ment dos no where advi&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to a War with <HI>Spain</HI> on the &s;core of our Company; but gives &s;uch Arguments to prove that they had no rea&s;on to dread the Effects if <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould make War with them on that Account, and that it was the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to have &s;upported the <HI>Scots</HI> in that Settlement, as have not yet been an&s;wer'd, and therefore we &s;hall &s;ay nothing farther of it here.</P>
<P>Our Author and his Friends are pleas'd to call our apprechen&s;ions of the Places being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>French</HI> bugbear Stories, becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> have another Game to play at pre&s;ent with <HI>Spain,</HI> or might have &s;ecur'd <HI>Carthagena</HI> when they had it in their Power; and that if <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> had any &s;uch de&s;ign, they may go &s;it down within a League of either &s;ide of our Colony with as good a Title as ours.</P>
<P>But that the <HI>French</HI> are genetally wi&s;er than to lay out their Mony upon &s;uch Tools as this Author appears to be by his way of argning, one would
<PB N="78" REF="100">be apt to think he had touch'd &s;ome <HI>Leuidor's.</HI> Does he conceive that the <HI>French</HI> under&s;tood their Intere&s;t &s;o little during the War that threatned their Ruine, as to &s;ettle a Colony in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> at a time when they &s;tood in more need of them at home to defend their own Country, and cultivate their Ground and Vineyards? Is it not known that their De&s;ign was on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate, in order to enable them to continue the War, and not on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantations, which they were in no Capacity to defend again&s;t the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> and their Allies if they had at that time &s;eiz'd any of them? Does our Author and his Subor|ners think that <HI>L.</HI> XIV. did not under&s;tand his Intere&s;t better than to offer at a Settlement in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially at a place of &s;uch Importance as <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and thereby have give the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> an opportunity of &s;ettling there them&s;elves by coming to drive him out? Could he think that the two Nations of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> that have the greate&s;t Naval Force, and were mo&s;t concern'd of any to reduce him to rea&s;on, would &s;it &s;till and &s;uffer him to &s;eize the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Treafures, and by that means enable him&s;elf to bring all <HI>Europe</HI> under his Yoke? It is impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a thought could ever enter into his mind; and therefore he had very good rea&s;on to forbear keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> &s;ince 'twould have been the ready way to have &s;poil'd his future preten&s;ions to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> in ca&s;e of the K. of <HI>Spain</HI>'s death, which every body then expected daily. And whenever it happens, if he die without I&s;&s;ue, as there's great odds he will, we &s;tand in need of bet|ter Guarantees than <HI>H&mdash;</HI> and his Suborners, that the <HI>Fr.</HI> King will not &s;eize the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>Darien</HI> into Boot; again&s;t which there are
<PB N="79" REF="100">tho&s;e who have &s;tudied Politicks as much as our Author, who are of opinion that the Settlement at <HI>Darien</HI> might have been no contemptible Bar|rier.</P>
<P>The Scribler takes upon him to pafs his word for his Maje&s;ty that the <HI>Scots</HI> Crown will receive no blemi&s;h or di&s;reputation by his wearing it. We believe his Maje&s;ty will &s;carcely thank him for his Security, and we are &s;atisfied our Nation will as little rely on it. But at the &s;ame time we mu&s;t tell this Gentleman and his Suborners, that we had as little rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. who was a Native of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would have di&s;|honour'd our Crown &s;o far as to order it to be brought to <HI>England;</HI> and therefore it is not impo&s;|fible for Princes to be over-per&s;waded by ill Coun|cil, to do &s;uch things as are incon&s;i&s;tent with the Honour of their Crowns. And thus &s;ome will ven|ture to &s;ay, that the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> was no ways honour'd, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops took place of the King of <HI>Scots</HI>'s Guards; and when the King of <HI>England</HI> takes upon him to condemn by Proclamations what the King of <HI>Scotland</HI> has ap|prov'd by Act of Parliament and Letters Pa|tent.</P>
<P>The Scribler comes next to give us a ta&s;te of his Skill in the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory he brags of &s;o much, by telling us the Fate of &s;ome great <HI>Scots</HI> Families that &s;well'd beyond their Proportion. His In&s;tan|ces of the <HI>Cummins</HI> and <HI>Gouries</HI> &s;ufficiently di&s;co|ver his Ignorance of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory. The for|mer was indeed a very great Family, but are an in|au&s;picious in&s;tance for him and tho&s;e of his kid|ney, their ruin not being occa&s;ion'd by their Great|ne&s;s, but by joying with the Enemies of our Na|tion as this Renegado does.</P>
<PB N="80" REF="101">
<P>As for his Application of his In&s;tances, it &s;erves to di&s;cover the malicious De&s;igns of him&s;elf and Suborners again&s;t the two greate&s;t Families that are now left in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The kind treatment this Author met with from one of the&s;e great Men up|on his arrival, after having de&s;erted our Colony, would have oblig'd any but a Mon&s;ter of Ingrati|tude to have forborn &s;uch a cau&s;ele&s;s and invenom'd Reflection, which nothing but ingrain'd Malice can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>We come in the next place to take a view of the Book it &s;elf. In the very fir&s;t Page he owns <HI>he is no Friend to the</HI> Scots <HI>Company, and alledges he has more rea&s;on for it than tho&s;e Skeletons that are &s;tarved to death.</HI> This we hope is &s;ufficient to &s;hew what credit is to be given to his Narrative, wherein tho he pro|mi&s;es to keep clo&s;e to matter of Fact, he abounds with bla&s;phemous and impertinent Digre&s;&s;ions: One of the fir&s;t we &s;hall take notice of, is his un|mannerly Reflection on the City of <HI>London,</HI> pag. 3. <HI>as a place where Matter is never wanting to exerci&s;e plodding Heads.</HI> Which is &s;o near a kin to the Lan|guage of the Faction that in the late Reigns aim'd at the de&s;truction of that Noble Emporium, which de&s;erves to be the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Univer&s;e, that we cannot in the lea&s;t doubt but it proceeds from the &s;ame Spirit. Of the &s;ame nature is his reflection, <HI>pag.</HI> 7. upon the <HI>London</HI> Sub&s;cribers, who came in &s;o fa&s;t to the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, <HI>that he thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t man that could get his Name fir&s;t down in our Books:</HI> Which is a plain demon&s;tration that tho&s;e eager Sub&s;cribers thought the De&s;ign no way prejudicial to the Intere&s;t of their Country; for upon enquiry it will be found, that mo&s;t of them were &s;uch as had zealou&s;ly appear'd for its Liberty in former Reigns.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="101">
<P>His malicious Reflection in that &s;ame Page, as if the Company had promis'd 20000 <HI>l</HI> to <HI>Pater&s;on, Smith,</HI> and <HI>Lodg,</HI> to engage Sub&s;criptions in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and the <HI>Hans</HI>-Towns, is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e: they had not one Farthing promis'd them, tho to be &s;ure the Company would have rewarded them for their Pains and Service, as it was rea&s;onable they &s;hould; be&s;ides, it appears by the eagerne&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hamburgers</HI> to &s;ub&s;cribe, until they were prevented by their re&s;pective Governments, that there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch a Bribe to bring in Sub&s;criptions.</P>
<P>His Reflection, <HI>pag.</HI> 8. of our printing the Ad|dre&s;s of the Commons at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but not the King's An&s;wer, admitting it to be true, is &s;o far from being criminal, that it rather argues the greate&s;t re&s;pect imaginable for his Maje&s;ty, whom we would not le&s;&s;en in the e&s;teem of the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who knew they had a na|tural Right to claim and expect his Protection. His owning in that &s;ame Page, that the Company's Books had not been long open'd in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> till 400000 <HI>l</HI> was &s;ign'd, and that all &s;orts of People (whom he is pleas'd to expre&s;s under the &s;currilous denomination of poor, blind and lame) crouded in with their Sub&s;criptions, &s;erves to confute his foregoing and following Reflections, <HI>That the Com|pany was obliged to promi&s;e</HI> 20000 <HI>l</HI> to procure Sub|&s;criptions, and to go where the Money lay, viz. <HI>to</HI> Hol|land <HI>and the</HI> Hans-<HI>Towns;</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince he owns him&s;elf, <HI>p.</HI> 10, 19. That <HI>they were baulk'd of their Sub&s;criptions in</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Holland, <HI>and had not one Groat of the</HI> Hamburgers <HI>Money.</HI></P>
<P>His Reflection upon Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> pag, 8. whom he bla&s;phemou&s;ly calls <HI>the Man Pater&s;on,</HI> alluding to the Apo&s;tles calling our Saviour <HI>the Man Chri&s;ts,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="102">is altogether fal&s;e: he always propos'd the paying half the Sub&s;criptions, and mo&s;t of the Sub&s;cribers were re&s;olved to pay the whole; as it appears they have already a con&s;iderable part of it, by their having &s;ent away three Convoys, and being bu&s;y in preparing a fourth. His Irreligious and Athei|&s;tical temper appears further by his reflecting up|on their expecting good Returns by the <HI>old Cant of God's Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> as if it were po&s;&s;ible to look for Suc|ce&s;s in any thing without the Divine Benediction, or ridiculous to expre&s;s our dependency on it. But it &s;eems his Suborners are re&s;olv'd that our Na|tion &s;hall be huff'd, banter'd, and bla&s;phem'd out of all their Rights as Men and Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>His next Reflection, <HI>p.</HI> 9. of our &s;ending Per|&s;ons to build &s;ix Ships of fifty Guns apiece at <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> with a kind opinion of the Company, and thereby make it appear how willing we were to extend the warm Rays of our Octroy to people who de&s;erv'd it better than our ungrateful Neighbours, is mali|cious to the highe&s;t degree. He and his Suborners very well know, that we could neither build nor buy in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e of the oppo&s;ition made to us there; and &s;ince 'tis known that they can build cheaper in <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> than in <HI>England,</HI> our offering fir&s;t to lay out our Money with our Neighbours, and not going beyond Sea till we were compell'd to it, is a proof from his own Mouth, that we had no other but friendly Intentions to|wards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>His In&s;inuation of the Difference betwixt the Kirk and Church Parties, about each of them im|ploying their own In&s;truments, &s;hews more Malice than Wi&s;dom; &s;ince admitting People of different Per&s;wa&s;ions into Companies is practi&s;ed in all trad|ing
<PB N="83" REF="102">parts of the World, and particularly in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> where the Di&s;&s;enters have no &s;mall &s;hare in all their Funds and Companies: but by this they may &s;ee what fair Treatment they are to expect, if <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborners could get their wills. The old Popi&s;h Maxim would &s;oon be brought into practice, that no man &s;hould have Leave to buy or &s;ell, but he that is of the public Religion.</P>
<P>His next Story of our Debate about entru&s;ting any man that was fed on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beef and Pudding with 20000 <HI>l</HI> for the u&s;e of our Delegates abroad, is equally &s;currilous and fal&s;e. We tru&s;ted no man but Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> with that Money, and did not think it &s;it that every Sub&s;criber, but that only a &s;pecial Committee &s;hould know how that Money was to be imploy'd. Nor can this be charg'd up|on us as a piece of fooli&s;h Confidence in Mr. <HI>Pater|&s;on,</HI> whom the Scribler owns <HI>P.</HI> 4. to have been in|tru&s;ted with laying the Foundation of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> tho ill rewarded for it. His malicious Calumny, that Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> did afterwards form the <HI>Darien</HI> Project to be reveng'd on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion, is &s;ufficiently fal&s;ified by his and our fir&s;t Offers to take in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as joint Sub&s;cribers, after the &s;aid Project was actually form'd, and imparted to &s;ome &s;elect Heads, as he him&s;elf owns <HI>P.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Smith</HI>'s cheating us of 8500 it was our Misfortune, not our Crime, as is manife&s;t from our Diligence in recovering 4500 <HI>l</HI> of it. This Rene|do's &s;aying <HI>P.</HI> 11. that <HI>Smith</HI> de&s;ervedly bubled us, argues him&s;elf to be as great a Cheat as <HI>Smith;</HI> and there's little rea&s;on to doubt, but he de|frauded the Company as far as opportunity would allow him, when intru&s;ted as Pur&s;er with their Stores from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, which he &s;eems to own him&s;elf when he boa&s;ts of his bringing
<PB N="84" REF="103">home as much Gold-du&s;t from <HI>Darien,</HI> as any of the Coun&s;ellors, <HI>P.</HI> 149.</P>
<P>His A&s;&s;ertion <HI>P.</HI> 14. that Capt. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> was cheat|ed of the 2 <HI>per Cent</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion Money, is a &s;hame|le&s;s Fal&s;hood; the Captain was &s;atisfied, and re|warded to his own content.</P>
<P>The next proof we have of the Ingenuity of this Renegado and his Suborners, is <HI>P.</HI> 15. where he tells us that <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> being in Drink, babbled out a Secret of the Company at <HI>Camphire,</HI> viz. <HI>That their Act empowered them to give Commi&s;&s;ions to any kind of People (without asking their Nation) to trade to the</HI> Indies <HI>under</HI> Scots <HI>Colours; and that &s;uch People might di&s;po&s;e of their</HI> India <HI>Goods where they pleas'd, providing they made a &s;ham Entry in</HI> Scotland. To &s;ay that this was a <HI>Secret of the Company,</HI> and in the &s;ame breath to inform the World that Mr. <HI>Pater|&s;on</HI> &s;aid, <HI>they were impowered to do &s;o by their Act,</HI> which was every where publick, and in print, is like the re&s;t of the Libeller's Incon&s;i&s;tencies: But his Suborners and he were &s;o far tran&s;ported with Malice, that they re&s;olv'd to dre&s;s our Act of Par|liament throughout in the di&s;gui&s;e of a Cheat, and charge it upon the Company as &s;ecret Intrigues, without ever con&s;idering that the Act it &s;elf would di&s;cover their Fal&s;hood and Malice. The Clau&s;e of the Act is as follows: <Q>And that the &s;aid Company may, by virtue hereof, grant and de|legate &s;uch Rights, Properties, Powers and Im|munities, and permit and allow &s;uch &s;ort of Trade, Commerce, and Navigation into their Plantations, Colonies, Cities, Towns, or Places of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as the &s;aid Company &s;hall from time to time judg &s;it and convenient.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e being the very words of the Act, the <HI>Dutch</HI> could not be impos'd upon in that manner by
<PB N="85" REF="103">Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> if he had been &s;o minded; or had he been drunk, as the Libeller &s;ays, when he told the &s;tory, they mu&s;t have been very weak men, that would offer to &s;ign upon the words of a drunken man, without &s;eeing the Act it &s;elf. It is not to be doubted but this Clau&s;e impowers the Company to allow &s;uch a Trade as <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> mentions; and therefore it might be proper enough for Mr. <HI>Pater|&s;on</HI> to urge it as an Argument to engage Sub&s;eri|bers: but that he could do it in the&s;e Terms that <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> here &s;ets down, there's no ground to be|lieve; and therefore his An&s;wer to tho&s;e that would not &s;ign but on that bottom, <HI>that the Com|pany had no occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of that Power at pre|&s;ent,</HI> was very proper. The Story of the &s;ham Entry in <HI>Scotland,</HI> paying 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the Com|pany, and thereby under&s;elling the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> 17 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is &s;o void of all &s;en&s;e, that it would &s;eem the Libeller and his Suborners were drunk when they &s;ugge&s;ted it. The Act does in|deed oblige &s;uch Ships as were imploy'd by the Company to break bulk in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but lays no &s;uch Obligation upon tho&s;e that they might im|power to trade to their Colony: And con&s;idering what has been already &s;aid of the Drawbacks, that the Cargo of the &s;aid Ships was Cu&s;tom-free no where but in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that by his own con|ce&s;&s;ion they were to pay 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> at lea&s;t to the Company, how was it po&s;&s;ible they could under&s;el the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> 17 <HI>per Cent.</HI> e&s;pecially con&s;i|dering the va&s;t Quantities that tho&s;e two Companies buy at a time, and by con&s;equence were like to have the prime Co&s;t ea&s;ier than our Infant Com|pany?</P>
<P>After all this &s;ham Story, he happens to tell the main rea&s;on of the Mi&s;carriage of our De&s;ign in
<PB N="86" REF="104"><HI>Holland</HI> and perhaps of its doing &s;o in <HI>England. The</HI> Dutch Ea&s;t <HI>and</HI> We&s;t India <HI>Companies,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>complain'd to the Lords of</HI> Am&s;terdam <HI>that the</HI> Scots <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners were de&s;igning the ruin of their Trade.</HI> Which by the way &s;hews that the Project of an <HI>American</HI> Trade was di&s;cours'd of by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; which the Libeller, it's probable, would not have mention'd, had not his Memory given him the &s;lip, and that he forgot he had for|merly told us that the <HI>Darien</HI> Project was &s;till kept &s;ecret. Why then &s;hould the <HI>Dutch We&s;t-India</HI> Company be &s;o much concerned at our taking Sub|&s;criptions there, but that they knew we had a de|&s;ign on the I&s;thmus of <HI>America?</HI> and therefore their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company knowing al&s;o, that we being once Ma&s;ters of a good Settlement there, it would have abridg'd the way, and made Voyages &s;peedier to <HI>China, Japan,</HI> the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where their Trade lies, they thought it might in time be dangerous for them, if that <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> So that there's no rea&s;on to doubt but they found Intere&s;t enough at the We&s;t end of the Town to lay as many rubs in our way as was po&s;&s;ible to be done.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 17. The Libellers give us another Evidence of their Candor and Ingenuity, when they tell us, <Q>The <HI>Hamburghers</HI> knew nothing of <HI>Darien,</HI> but builded altogether on Ships laden with <HI>India</HI> Goods, whereof their City and Port was to be the Receptacle and Mart, whil&s;t <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> wanted only Mony to rai&s;e Forces to overrun <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></Q> But our Author and his Suborners ought to have con&s;ider'd, that &s;ince they have told us of the Fears of the <HI>Dutch We&s;t-India</HI> Company, we could ea&s;ily infer, that the Project of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> could not be long conceal'd from the <HI>Hamburghers:</HI> That the
<PB N="87" REF="104">Act it &s;elf would &s;atisfy the Sub&s;cribers there, that the Company's Ships mu&s;t break bulk in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and therefore they could not expect to be the Re|ceptacle and Mart of our Stores: whatever they might hope for as to conveying the Merchan|dize to the Inland Places of <HI>Germany,</HI> they could not but think that we had Shipping of our own to carry our Goods to the Ports on the <HI>Baltick</HI> and <HI>Ger|man</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>In that &s;ame Page they give us another hint to confirm our Su&s;picion that it is more from the ap|prehen&s;ions of our le&s;&s;ening the <HI>Dutch</HI> than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, that the Court have &s;o violently oppos'd us, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>that the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> by joining with the <HI>Scots</HI> had a pro&s;pect of worming the <HI>Hollander</HI> out of a good part of the <HI>German</HI> Trade.</Q> Which admitting to be true, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had none but them&s;elves to blame for it, &s;ince we of|fer'd to take them in as joint Sub&s;cribers before we made any Propo&s;al to the <HI>Hamburghers;</HI> nor is it any ways unrea&s;onable in it &s;elf that <HI>Germans</HI> &s;hould have the preference of other Nations in trading with <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>After a great deal of prophane Banter and ri|diculing the &s;acred Text, he tells us that the Human Rea&s;on of our Di&s;appointment was an unnece&s;&s;ary Paragraph in our <HI>Octroy, which occa&s;ion'd a great many</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and</HI> Holland <HI>Speculations,</HI> viz. <HI>That in ca&s;e the Company &s;hould be interrupted in their Trade,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>the King had ingaged to interpo&s;e the Royal Autho|rity to do them right, and that at the public Charge;</HI> which, &s;ays he, <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> and the re&s;t in&s;inuated in all Companies; <HI>That the King was to a&s;&s;ist and defend them with his Ships of War, or otherwi&s;e, if there was occa&s;ion, and that out of his own Pocket, which they did not question to be</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Coin.</HI></P>

<P>There's no rea&s;onable Man will think it unnece&s;|&s;ary that a Prince &s;hould protect his Subjects in their Trade, either by his Men of War or otherwi&s;e; and therefore this being a Clau&s;e of the Act of Parliament, it was no ways unnece&s;&s;ary to be put into the Patent: and we will adventure to tell <HI>H&mdash;</HI> and his Suborners that they who advis'd his Maje&s;ty to refu&s;e our Company the three Men of War built at our own Charge, when they of|fer'd to be at the expence of maintaining them, have advis'd him to act contrary to the Tru&s;t re|pos'd in him as King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and to contravene this very Act of Parliament, and that which or|der'd tho&s;e Ships to be built for defence of Trade; than which there cannot be a more fal&s;e &s;tep in Government: for when once People perceive that Princes have no regard to the Laws made for the protection and welfare of the Subject, they will naturally think them&s;elves ab&s;olv'd from &s;uch as re|quire their Allegiance, and &s;upport of the Sove|raign.

The Libeller owns that the Words of our Act cannot bear it, and the World knows that our Parliaments never pretend to di&s;po&s;e of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ships or Mony; and therefore no man of &s;en&s;e will believe this Renegado, when he &s;ays the <HI>Scots</HI> Company put that Glo&s;s on the Text for their own advantage, &s;ince that had been directly to expo&s;e them&s;elves.

<P>Much le&s;s can they &s;erve to ju&s;tify the Memorial given in at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> by Sir <HI>Paul Ricaut</HI> again&s;t our taking Sub&s;criptions there: Which Memorial, tho minc'd by our Libeller, yet ev'n as he repre&s;ents it, is again&s;t the Law of Nations, and indeed &s;carce|ly reconcileable to good &s;en&s;e; in the fir&s;t place to call our Agents private Men, who acted by the Company's Authority, and according to Act of Parliament; and in the next place to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly join with us in hopes of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Protection, when the Oppo&s;ition made to us by the Court of <HI>England</HI> was known all over <HI>Europe:</HI> nay the Scribler him&s;elf owns, <HI>P.</HI> 17. <HI>That the more Oppo&s;ition the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and</HI> Dutch <HI>offer'd to the Project, the more the</HI> Hamburghers <HI>thought it their Interest to embrace it.</HI> This is &s;ufficient to con|vince the Suborners that the next time they hire a Scribler to belie the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, they mu&s;t be &s;ure to pitch upon one that has a better Me|mory.</P>
<P>His next Reflections <HI>P.</HI> 22, 23. <HI>That our Ships were neither fit for Trade nor War, that our Cargo was not proper, that our main De&s;ign was the Buccaneer Trade, that above</HI> 10000 l. <HI>was deficient of the fir&s;t Payments, and most of the Sub&s;cribers not able to rai&s;e their</HI> Quota, are equally fal&s;e with the re&s;t. The Ships for their Burden and Size, are as fit either for Trade or War as any in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Cargo of Cloth, Stuffs, Shoes, Stockins, Slippers, and Wigs, mu&s;t needs be proper for a Country where the Natives go naked for want of Apparel, and fit to be exchanged for other Commodities, either in the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch, French,</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantations.
<PB N="90" REF="106">For Bibles we &s;uppo&s;e our Libeller would ra|ther we had carried Ma&s;s Books; yet others will be of opinion, that 1500 of 'em was no unfit Cargo: Our own Colony might have di&s;pens'd with that number in a little time; nor were they unfit to have been put into the hands of &s;uch of the Natives, e&s;pecially of the younger &s;ort, that might learn our language. For Hoes, Axes, Macheet Knives, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> they were ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for our &s;elves, and a Commodity much valued by the Natives. Fifteen hundred &s;quare Buccaneer Pieces, and proportionable Ammunition, was no &s;uch extraordinary Store for eleven or twelve hun|dred men: and whereas he maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuates that Buccaneering was our main De&s;ign, the Event hath prov'd it to be fal&s;e; had that been our in|tent, we might ea&s;ily have invaded the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantations at both ends of the <HI>I&s;thmus; Sancta Maria,</HI> nor <HI>Panama</HI> it &s;elf, could never have been able to with&s;tand &s;uch a force, when a few un|di&s;ciplin'd Buccaneers did &s;o ea&s;ily take them. It's well enough known there was a parcel of as brave Men that went with our Fleet as perhaps <HI>Great Britain</HI> could afford, many of 'em inur'd to War and Fatigues, and knew how to look an Enemy in the Face without being daunted. They had giv'n proofs enough of that in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where no men alive could fight with more Bravery and Zeal than they did for the Common Cau&s;e, tho &s;ome Peo|ple have &s;ince thought &s;it to &s;tarve them. That there was above 10000 <HI>l</HI> of the 100000 <HI>l</HI> not paid in, is fal&s;e; there was not above 2000 <HI>l</HI> wanting. For tho&s;e great men that thought their Countenance enough, and therefore refus'd to pay in their Sub&s;criptions, he &s;hall have our leave to name
<PB N="91" REF="106">them; but perhaps his Suborners will not care to have their Friends &s;o much expos'd. That mo&s;t of the Sub&s;cribers were unable to rai&s;e their <HI>Quota,</HI> is demon&s;trably fal&s;e, by our &s;ending away two Con|voys &s;ince, the thirds being greater by far than the fir&s;t, and that we are now preparing a fourth. As to the Companies charging 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> advance on every Article of the 19000 <HI>l</HI> Stock, it's well enough known that &s;o much Advance is thought nothing in a <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade; it was all the pro|fit. the Company was to have, and only charged in the Books by way of Formality, that the Colony might know what they were indebted to the Com|pany.</P>
<P>His Story, <HI>p. 23.</HI> of its being propos'd in the Company <HI>to &s;ell off their Ships and Cargo, and di|vide the Product among&s;t the Sub&s;cribers,</HI> is nothing eul our di&s;honour, nor at all to be wondred at, con&s;idering the unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition we had met with from Court. That <HI>we rejected it as inglo|rious,</HI> argues &s;till that we are not &s;o mean-&s;pirited as he el&s;ewhere repre&s;ents us. His ba&s;e Reflecti|ons, <HI>p.</HI> 24. on the Company, as if they had de&s;pair'd of the de&s;ign, and &s;ent their men to Sea on pur|po&s;e to peri&s;h; and on <HI>Drummellier, that be order'd the Colony to get Mony hone&s;tly if they could, but be &s;ure to get it; and if they came home without it, then the Devil get them all,</HI> &s;erve only to di&s;cover his own Temper, and that he thinks all men act and &s;peak like him&s;elf. We have faid enough already to demon&s;trate the Hone&s;ty of both Company and Colony: Had their de&s;ign been to get: Mony with|out regard to Hone&s;ty, they would not have been &s;tarv'd to death by the Proclamations, and other oppo&s;ition made them at Court; they could quick|ly
<PB N="92" REF="107">have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mines, which the Scribler owns, <HI>p.</HI> 164. were within twelve Leagues of them, and with much more ea&s;e of the 40000 <HI>l</HI> that was &s;unk in the <HI>French</HI> Ship. But he &s;erves the Suborners for their Mony much at the &s;ame rate he did the <HI>Scots</HI> Compa|ny.</P>
<P>His Reflection <HI>p.</HI> 25. that Mr. <HI>Stratford</HI> was oblig'd to arre&s;t our Ships at <HI>Hamburgh</HI> for 800 <HI>l Flemi&s;h,</HI> as they were fitting out, &s;erves only to di&s;cover his own malice and folly; Mr. <HI>Stratford</HI> had very good Security for 800 <HI>l Flemi&s;h</HI> when he had four Ships in Port not yet fitted out; and his receiving his Mony in a fortnight or three weeks, as the Libeller owns in the &s;ame Paragraph, &s;hows he had no ill Payma&s;ters to deal with. It were well for <HI>England</HI> if all tho&s;e that have been im|ployed in the Royal Navy could &s;ay as much by his Suborners and their Friends. As for our di&s;charg|ing Mr. <HI>Stratford</HI> to be any longer our Ca&s;hier, there's no need of a&s;&s;igning any other Cau&s;e for it, but that Sr. <HI>Paul Ricaut</HI>'s Memorial render'd it needle&s;s; and to that &s;ame account we mu&s;t charge the two Ships that were left there to rot in their Ou&s;e. But at the &s;ame time we will tell him we had no great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with Mr. <HI>Strat|ford</HI>'s Conduct, and believe we have le&s;s now than ever &s;ince this Libeller defends him.</P>
<P>His Story <HI>p.</HI> 26 of Mr, <HI>Hender&s;on's</HI> arre&s;ting another of our Ships for 3000 <HI>l</HI> is &s;ufficiently an|&s;wer'd by him&s;elf, when he tells us, that he and his Partners fail'd in their Sub&s;criptions, which was a ju&s;t debt due to the Company, and there|fore they had rea&s;on to demand and expect it, e&s;|pecially he being a <HI>Scots</HI>-man: yet the Company
<PB N="93" REF="107">dealt very kindly with him on that account; and &s;o much the more, that they con&s;ider'd his being a Re&s;identer in <HI>Holland,</HI> where he was liable both to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Court, to who&s;e account the Libeller mu&s;t al&s;o charge this Affront, and the Lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tain'd at <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>What he &s;ays of our Seamen, <HI>p.</HI> 27, 28. is a manife&s;t untruth. They were immediately paid, extreamly well &s;atisfied; and we had &s;uch choice of able Seamen who were willing to go in the Expedition, that we turn'd feveral a&s;hoar after they had embarqu'd, as having no occa&s;ion for them. As to his Reflection on Mr. <HI>Robert Black|wood</HI> for pinching them of their Wages, and <HI>p.</HI> 46. for cheating them as to their Provi&s;ions; that Gentleman is now at <HI>London,</HI> where we leave <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and him to account for it. We doubt not but Mr. <HI>Blackwood</HI> may have Ju&s;tice done him in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall</HI> if he thinks &s;it to &s;ue for it; but &s;o much we think our &s;elves oblig'd to &s;ay in his Vindication during his ab&s;ence, that he was never charg'd with any &s;uch thing by the Company.</P>
<P>His next Reflections on the Transfer, <HI>p. 29.</HI> by which he would impo&s;e on the World as if it had been a Trick of the Company to cheat the seamen of their Wages, are &s;o much the le&s;s to be credited, that he him&s;elf is a Party, and com|menc'd the Suit he talks of in <HI>Doctors Commons;</HI> which tho that Court may perhaps have determin'd in his favour, becau&s;e the Bargain was made with him in <HI>London,</HI> and tho&s;e that made it were on the Spot, and for other Cau&s;es be&s;t known to them|&s;elves, it is nothing at all to the matter in hand; our Courts have no rea&s;on to take them for a Pre|cedent, and our Company has as little to allow the Libeller any Wages.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="108">
<P>But to come to the Transfer, which he &s;o foully mi&s;repre&s;ents. It was &s;o far from being a clan|de&s;tine practice, that it was agreed on in publick Council, and but highly rea&s;onable that the Colony &s;hould be accountable to the Company for the Stock they intru&s;ted them with. The Libeller on|ly betrays his own Folly and Malice, and impo&s;es upon his Suborners, when he &s;ays the Gentle|men who gave their joint Bond to the Company for 70000 <HI>l</HI> were not worth &s;o many Engli&s;h Pence; for, admitting they had not been worth one penny of per&s;onal E&s;tate, they were intru&s;ted by the Company with 19000 <HI>l</HI> Cargo, and Ships, Provi&s;ions, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> to make it up 70000 <HI>l</HI> which was not charg'd upon them as their per&s;onal Debt, but upon the Colony as a Corporation, till the &s;ame was paid. What he &s;ays as to the Seamen is a malicious Untruth. It was indeed agreed that the Colony &s;hould pay them; but if they did not, the Company was to do it: and be&s;ides, the two months advance which the Libeller owns was paid them, the Company was to pay to them, or to tho&s;e that had their Powers, or Letters of Attorny, a Month in &s;ix, and have accordingly paid them. As to the Seamens being made believe that a&s;&s;oon as they had &s;et the Landmen on &s;hoar, they were to proceed on a trading Voyage, and return to <HI>Scot|land</HI> to be paid, it is equally fal&s;e, they being to &s;tay out whil&s;t the Company pleas'd.</P>
<P>Then as to the Transfer in general, it was &s;o far from being clande&s;tine, or a Trick, that the Com|pany was impower'd to make it by the Act of Parliament which gave them their Original, as any Per&s;on may &s;ee by turning to the Act it &s;elf,
<PB N="95" REF="108">which authorizes them to <HI>transfer their joint Stock, or Capital Fund, or any E&s;tate real or per&s;onal, Ships, Goods, &amp;c. belonging to the Company, under &s;uch Re|&s;trictions, Rules, Conditions, &amp;c. as the &s;aid Company &s;hall by writing in and upon their Books,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ap|point.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Landmen, whom he will al&s;o have to be impos'd upon, they knew what they had to relic on, and were very well &s;atisfied with it; and as to the Companys levying Souldiers under the No|tion of Planters, without asking leave of the Pri|vy Council, admitting it to be true, they are not at all to be blam'd for it, &s;ince they had no rea&s;on to think that the Faction at Court, which had con|traven'd Acts of Parliament by oppo&s;ing their Sub&s;criptions, and denying them the men of War built for the protection of our Trade, would al|low them to levy Souldiers under that Name. But the truth of the matter is this, they were really de&s;ign'd for' Planters, and not at all for Military Bu&s;ine&s;s; tho it was highly nece&s;&s;ary the Colony &s;hould have as many Officers and di&s;ciplin'd Men as they could, that they might be the more able to defend them&s;elves in ca&s;e of Attaque: and there|fore his railing again&s;t the Colony for offering to puni&s;h De&s;erters and other Criminals, <HI>pag.</HI> 31. on|ly di&s;covers his own ignorance and malice; for by the Act of Parliament they had the whole Power, Civil and Military, conferr'd upon them, and ac|cordingly might exerci&s;e their Power upon all Per|&s;ons belonging to the Company as they &s;aw cau&s;e &s;o that this is again a libelling of the Act of Parliament thro the Company's &s;ides.</P>
<P>His Repre&s;entation of the &s;even Men cho&s;en for Coun&s;ellors, <HI>page</HI> 34. is fal&s;e and malicious to the highe&s;t degree. The liberty given to add other
<PB N="96" REF="109">&s;ix to tho&s;e &s;even, was not, as he &s;pitefully in&s;i|nuates, for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> men of Sub&s;tance that &s;hould join them from the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Planta|tions, but for &s;uch of their own number as they might think fit to a&s;&s;ume afterwards. It cannot once enter into the thoughts of any man of &s;en&s;e, that the Colony &s;hould at fir&s;t entru&s;t Foreigners, and e&s;pecially <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;ts in their Government, or that the Company had any de&s;ign they &s;hould do &s;o; but he and his Suborners think it their Inte|re&s;t to make us odious to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> by accu&s;ing us of a de&s;ign to drain their Colo|nies.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> whom he hath all along a|bus'd he happens now thro Inadvertency to vin|dicate him from his own Calumnies; he formerly charg'd him as being Partner with <HI>Smith</HI> in cheat|ing the Company of 8500 <HI>l</HI> and now he tells us that Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> was brought to this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> either to go aboard the Fleet bound for <HI>Caledonia</HI> as a Volunteer, or to go to Pri&s;on at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for Debt; which, had he cheated the Company of &s;o much Mony as this Libeller pretends there had been no occa&s;ionfor, he might have paid his Debts, and gone where he would: and be&s;ides, the Scrib|ler vindicates the Company at the &s;ame time from his former Charge of their being bewitch'd by <HI>Pater&s;on</HI>'s golden Dreams &amp;<HI>c.</HI> for had they relied &s;o much upon him as the Libeller alledges, they would never have &s;hew'd that indifference for him which here he ridicules him with. Such has been the hard Fate of the Suborners, that their Tool has not the &s;en&s;e to make his Evidence con&s;i&s;tent, but every where cuts his own Throat by Self-con|tradictions.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="109">
<P>To &s;um up the Matter according to the Libeller's own Evidence. In the Council there were &s;ome Men of Qua|lity, that had been bred to the Sword and the Law, others had been Officers both by Sea and Land, and &s;ome that had gain'd Experience in Merchandizing, and &s;everal Trades.</P>
<P>His Banter on the death of the Mini&s;ters and Bla&s;phe|mous abu&s;e of Scripture, <HI>P.</HI> 37. &s;mell &s;o rank of the Athei&s;t and Libertine, and do &s;o evidently prove that he hath lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of Humanity and Religion, that we are &s;aris&s;ied it will do his Ma&s;ters and their Cau&s;e more hurt than Service; and therefore we pa&s;s it over.</P>
<P>The next Proof we have of his Fal&s;hood and Malice, is his long Story about Mr. <HI>Wafer,</HI> from <HI>Page</HI> 38 to 45, wherein he does &s;o blend Truth with Fal&s;hood, as &s;hews he had a mind at any rate to be&s;patter the Reputation of the Committee of the Company: the &s;aid Commitree knew nothing of tho&s;e Gentlemers treating with <HI>Wafer</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> till they acquainted them with it, and it was only upon their Recommendation that they &s;ent for him: As to their Collecting any Guineas at <HI>Pontack's</HI> for Mr. <HI>Wafer,</HI> it is altogether fal&s;e. The Articles were drawn by Mr. <HI>James Campbel</HI> the Merchant, now in <HI>London,</HI> and wrote by Mr. <HI>Fitz Gerald</HI> an Iri&s;h Merchant, who both can re&s;tify that this Matter is foully mi&s;repre&s;ented; for Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI> had an Alternative propos'd to him, which he agreed to, <HI>viz.</HI> to have &s;o much if the Company thought &s;it to imploy him, and &s;o much for his trouble and pains if they did not; the Company was &s;o far from &s;tanding in any need of his Book, that they had a Manu&s;cript of it before ever they &s;aw him, which was altogether unknown to the Gentle|men that treated with him at <HI>London</HI> this he him&s;elf knows to be true, and that to his no &s;mall &s;urprize, they repeared &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages out of it to him, and indeed the Manu&s;cript is more particular than his Book, whatever Cau&s;e he hath &s;ince had to make any Alterations in it we know not. The Company upon the whole, finding that he could inform them of no thing con&s;iderable more than what was in the Manu&s;cript, and that he could do them no great Service, left him at his Liberty to publi&s;h his Book when he pleas'd, gave him about 100 <HI>l</HI> fir&s;t and la&s;t for his Pains and Expence, with which he was very well
<PB N="98" REF="110">&s;atisfied, and hath declared &s;everal times &s;ince that the Company dealt very honourably with him, tho Mr. <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> took a great deal of pains to make him publi&s;h a Memoire to the contrary, which by his hone&s;t Friend Mr. <HI>Fitz Gerald</HI>'s Advice he de&s;i&s;ted from doing. As to the Libeller's malicious In&s;inuation that they had no further Service for him when once he had di&s;covered the place where the <HI>Nicaragua-Wood</HI> grew, It is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, for the Manu&s;cript they had was very particular in that. This Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI> knows to be true, and if he have but a ju&s;t re&s;entment, he is equal|ly concern'd to vindicate him&s;elf; for, the Libeller reflects as much upon him as upon the Company, when he charges him with putting a Cheat upon them, as to their <HI>Nicaragua-Wood, P.</HI> 44. which <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> &s;ays he and others went in &s;earch of for &s;everal Miles along the Coa&s;t, but could find none; and yet he magnifies <HI>Wafer</HI>'s Freedom, and being ingenious by informing them &s;o particularly, as to the place where the <HI>Nicaragua-Wood</HI> grew,<HI>P.</HI> 41. So perpetually does this malicious Libeller contradict him&s;elf.&mdash;As to the other parts of his Story of Mr. <HI>Wafers</HI> being con|ceal'd near <HI>Haddington,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> it was no more than what Prudence would have directed any Men to do in the like Circum&s;tances: the Company not knowing till after having di&s;cours'd him whether he could do them any Service or not; it was not their Wi&s;dom to expo&s;e him to publick View; and having found that he could not &s;erve them, it was equally prudent in them to keep him at an uncertainty as to their de&s;ign; they being under no obligation to acquaint him with it. As to the Story of Admiral <HI>Bembo</HI>'s waiting their motion; if they did &s;ay &s;o, the Event hath made it but too probable; he hath waited &s;o long in tho&s;e Parts till our Colony hath left <HI>Darien:</HI> what Orders he had concerning it, or what Part he hath acted in it, Time mu&s;t determine; but if all that we have heard of large Bills being return'd him, and of his Offers by his Sloops to draw our Men from our Co|lony be true, there's rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he was &s;ent thi|ther with no de&s;ign for our advantage: However that may be we know not; but this we know, that if our Enemies at Court had been as zealous to protect us as they have been to ruin us, the Admiral would certainly have had Orders to have made Repri&s;als on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for detaining
<PB N="99" REF="110">Capt. <HI>Pincarton</HI> his Ship and Men, contrary to Treary with the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> when forc'd a-&s;hoar by a Storm under the Walls of <HI>Carthagena.</HI></P>
<P>He tells us,<HI>P.</HI> 45, <Q>That two thirds of the Provi&s;ion were &s;pent e're the Fleet &s;ail'd, that there was none to be had in <HI>Scotland</HI> at that time, and if there had, there was no Money; the 100000 <HI>l</HI> being &s;unk, and the Com|pany's Credit not worth 2 <HI>d.</HI> and that they had &s;tuck there, had it not been for &s;ome few Pillars of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company who mortgag'd their E&s;tates; for which the Company made over three of their Ships to them for their Security.</Q></P>
<P>That there was no Provi&s;ions to be had then in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> will seadily be allow'd him, is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all his malicious Clamour again&s;t the Company, and to confute his own Objection, <HI>P.</HI> 155. in defence of his Ma|&s;ters, again&s;t the Company, for not &s;ending them Provi|&s;ions. That there was no Money, and that the Company's Credit was not worth 2 <HI>d.</HI> is confuted by him&s;elf, when he owns that a few of the Pillats rais'd 5000 <HI>l</HI> and took three of the Company's Ships for Security. For that a few of the Pillars could rai&s;e 5000 <HI>l</HI> and the Company have three new Ships, one of them of 70 Guns to give for Security; and yet the Company's Credit not to be worth 2 <HI>d.</HI> is a palpable Contradiction.</P>
<P>That any of the Company Mortgaged their E&s;tates to rai&s;e Money, is fal&s;e; they advanc'd it on their own Cre|dit, as they might well do, it being well known there are &s;everal of them who have as much yearly E&s;tate as the Sum he &s;peaks of: Nor did they de&s;ire the Company's Ships in &s;ecurity, but only a Bond which it was rea&s;onable they &s;hould have.</P>
<P>He comes next to give us an Account of the &s;hortne&s;s of the Provi&s;ions, <HI>P.</HI> 46. and of his own Hone&s;ty in the mean time, in not acquainting the Commadore with it till they were three days at Sea; perhaps he had em|bezel'd them him&s;elf, or Pocketed &s;ome of the Money, for he owns that he had &s;ome time before been concerned in the Victualling part, and therefore dar'd not to &s;ay any thing of it on Shore, le&s;t it might have been prov'd upon him; but however that is, this we are &s;ure of, that the Company had Letters from their Ships at the <HI>Maderas,</HI> that
<PB N="100" REF="111">they had Twelve Months Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, at &s;harp Allowance, and that if any thing fell &s;hort, it was likely to be their Bread: That they thought this to be true, may be rea&s;onably concluded from his own. Narrative, where he &s;ays the Council upon his Repre&s;entation, de&s;ign'd to &s;end an Expre&s;s from the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> to acquaint the Company with the &s;hortne&s;s of their Provi&s;ions, which to be &s;ure they would have done, had they been &s;en&s;ible that they were &s;o &s;hort as he alledges: Be&s;ides, he owns they had full Eleven Months Allowance of Stock-&s;i&s;h at four Days in the Week; when do it is probable that they had other things in proportion.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why they had no more Beer but Ten Tun, was that the Seamen could not depend on the Beer be|cau&s;e it &s;poils, they had great &s;tore of very good Water, and a very great quantity of Brandy which the Libeller takes no notice of. As for the Company's promi&s;ing them Credit at the <HI>Maderas,</HI> it is fal&s;e; nor was there any need of it, they had Pipe Staves and other Goods, which were thought proper for the <HI>Maderas,</HI> but if it did not an&s;wer, &s;o well as 'twas expected, 'twas but the common Misfortune of Merchants, who many times meet with &s;uch di&s;appointments. Nor is it to be expected that a Nation of &s;o little Experience in Trade as ours, &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;etting out, be free from Mi&s;takes or Mi&s;management, e&s;pecially &s;ince we have &s;uch Invective Enemics to deal with who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to get ill Men among&s;t us every where, on purpo&s;e to break our De&s;ign.</P>
<P>His next Reflection is on the &s;mall Allowance of Rea|dy Money, which is &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd when we tell him their Cargo was reckon'd in&s;tead of it, and as has been alrea|dy &s;aid, mu&s;t needs be conceiv'd to be very proper for a Country where People go naked for want of Apparel. They had an great deal of Butter, and excellent Beef, of Scots Breed, by which we gain'd an Experiment contrary to the common Notion; for upon trial it was found to be better than the Iri&s;h, and therefore our Men te&s;olv'd to keep it la&s;t. His Objection as to its having been Eighteen Months in Salt is frivolous. Scamen think nothing of that when they can carry Beef to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> and back again, and keep it good all the while. His Change upon <HI>Drummelier</HI> as having bought damnified. Wheat for their
<PB N="101" REF="111">Bread, and put the Money in his Poket, is malicious and fal&s;e: There's no Man but one of the Renegadoes Tem|per that can &s;u&s;pect that Worthy Gentleman to be capable of any &s;uch thing. Be&s;ides, the Bread was extraordinary good.</P>
<P>His Story, p. 50. about <HI>Crab-I&s;land,</HI> is fal&s;e; the Com|pany gave no po&s;itive Orders to leave any Men there, and its equally fal&s;e that the <HI>Danes</HI> prevented our taking Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it, our Men were there before the <HI>Danes</HI> came from St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Governour of which &s;u&s;pecting our De&s;ign, upon the arrival of the <HI>&V;nicorn</HI> there, &s;ent an Officer and Fifteen Men to A&s;&s;ert the King of <HI>Danmark</HI>'s Right, after our Men went off from the Place, they &s;aw the Dani&s;h Sloop in another Bay of the &s;ame I&s;land call'd <HI>French-Man</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> and a Tent a&s;hore with Dani&s;h Colours on it; upon which Captain <HI>Pennicook</HI> Landed again, told them we were Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before them, again&s;t which they offer'd their Prote&s;t to plea&s;e the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> but wi&s;h'd with all their Hearts we might &s;ettle there, for we &s;hould be a good Bulwark to them again&s;t the Spaniards of <HI>Por|tc-Rico,</HI> who are very trouble&s;ome Neighbours.</P>
<P>It is fal&s;e what he &s;ays p. 54. That Captain <HI>Andreas,</HI> after looking upon us at fir&s;t. Landing, did not come near us in three or four Weeks, for he came aboard us at fir&s;t with &s;ome of his Men on the 2d of <HI>November,</HI> and brought his Travelling Wife with him on the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> when he came on Board again, and was very well &s;atisfied with us; and on the 10th of the &s;ame Month, he and his Son, Wife and Si&s;ter, Din'd on Board us. And on the 30th of <HI>November</HI> he was invited on Board, hand&s;omly. Treated, and after having given a Rational Vindication of him&s;elf, as to the Matter &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t him by the other <HI>Danien</HI> Captains or Princes; and being inform'd of our real De|&s;ign, which before he &s;u&s;pected to be Piracy, he de&s;ir'd a Commi&s;&s;ion from us, which was readily Granted and cheer|fully Accepted; and he &s;olemnly promis'd to Defend us to the la&s;t drop of his Blood. That his Commi&s;&s;ion was left behind him in the Locker of the Round-Hou&s;e, cram'd in among&s;t empty Bottles, we have nothing but this Re|negado's Word for it: but admitting it to be &s;o, it does not therefore nece&s;&s;arily follow, that it was left there by <HI>Andreas,</HI> or his Order; it is not to be &s;uppos'd that a
<PB N="102" REF="112">Per&s;on of his Note, could creep into the Round-Hou&s;e un|di&s;cover'd: and perhaps it may be no unrea&s;onable Con|jecture, to think that it was &s;tole from him, and lodg'd there by this Renegado; for he owns that it was him&s;elf that found it, and he knows the Proverb, <HI>He that hides knows be&s;t where to find.</HI></P>
<P>His Story about <HI>Andreas</HI>'s <HI>Exit, P.</HI> 60. That he fell, or was thrown down the Main Hatch-way of the <HI>Caledonia</HI> in the Night time, after a Quarrel with <HI>Ambro&s;io,</HI> the great|e&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Captains, has &s;uch an Air of Malice and Fal&s;hood, that it requires better Evidence than that of a &s;elf-contradicting Libeller, before it can obtain belief with any Rational Man, or allowing it to be true, that he was actually tumbled down the Hatch-way in the Night time, it looks more like the Practice of &s;uch a Quarrel&s;ome ill natur'd Per&s;on as him&s;elf, than of any Body el&s;e. They that know his Behaviour to his own Captain, when he was Surgeon on Board one of the King's Ships, his quar|relling with Captain <HI>Pennicook,</HI> Commadore of our Ships that went to <HI>Darien,</HI> and the whole Tenor of his Conver|&s;ation, cannot think this any uncharitable Reflection. His unnatutal Rancor again&s;t his Native Country, and un|bounded Malice again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, make it pro|bable enough that he might do &s;uch a thing on purpo&s;e to render the Natives Enemies to the Colony; which he de|&s;erted him&s;elf about a Month after: And this is &s;o much the more probable, becau&s;e he exclaims again&s;t tho&s;e on Board, for not taking care of <HI>Andreas,</HI> nor letting him blood after his fall, &s;ince none was &s;o proper to do it as him&s;elf, who was a Surgeon, and on Board the Ship at the time.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t any further on his Train of Fal&s;|hoods and Incon&s;i&s;tencies in his Account of the Country, which being contrary, not only to all that have wrote of it, but al&s;o to the Journals and Letters &s;ent from our Co|lony. We have better rea&s;on to &s;ay, that his De&s;cription is Calculated to the Humour of our Enemies, and his Sub|orners, than that the Colony's and Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI>'s Accounts were Calculated to the Meridian of the <HI>Scots</HI> Company. To put this Matter out of all doubt, we &s;hall here &s;ubjoin the fir&s;t Letter &s;ent from <HI>Caledonia</HI> by the Council of the Colony to the Company, which is the Te&s;timony of &s;ix again&s;t one.</P>

<P><HI>O&V;R La&s;t to you was from the</HI> Maderas, <HI>of the 29th of</HI> Aug. <HI>and &s;ent by the &s;everal ways of</HI> Holland <HI>and</HI> Pottugal, <HI>to the Contents whereof we now refer, and in particular to the State of Provi&s;ions therewith &s;ent, and which we now find doth con&s;iderably fall &s;hort even of what was then computed, by rea&s;on of the badne&s;s of the Cask. The account of the remaining part of our Voyage, together with the mo&s;t material Tran&s;actions &s;ince, you may know by the enclo&s;ed Journal or Diary of our Pro|ceedings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We now &s;end you our Letters and Di&s;patches by Mr.</HI> Alex|ander Hamilton <HI>Merchant, who takes the opportunity of pa&s;s|ing to you by the way of</HI> Jamaica <HI>over</HI> England, <HI>to whom we de&s;ire you would order Forty Shillings Sterling to be paid Weekly, towards his Expences, during the time he &s;hall &s;tay with you negotiating our Affairs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Wealth, Fruitfulne&s;s, Health and good Situation of the Country proves for the better, much above our greate&s;t Expecta|tion, which God Almighty &s;eems to have wonderfully re&s;erv'd for this Occa&s;ion, and now to have prepar'd our Way, and di&s;|po&s;ed the</HI> Indies <HI>to that purpo&s;e. In our Pa&s;&s;age hither &s;eve|ral of our Number have been taken from us by Death (who&s;e Names we have herewith &s;ent you) and whereof the lo&s;s of our two Mini&s;ters is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to us. We therefore intreat you would u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours with the General A&s;&s;embly, for procuring others so &s;upply that great want: As to the Coun|try, we find it very healthful; for although we arriv'd here in the Rainy Sea&s;on, from which we had little or no &s;helter for &s;e|veral Weeks together, and many Sick among us, yet they are &s;o far recover'd, and in &s;o good a State of Health as could hardly any where be expected among &s;uch a number of Men together; nor know we any thing here of tho&s;e &s;everal dangerous and mortal Di|&s;tempers &s;o prevalent in the Engli&s;h and other American I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Fruitfulne&s;s this Country &s;eems not to give place to any in the World: For we have &s;een &s;everal of the Fruits, as</HI> Cocoa-Nuts, <HI>whereof Chocolate is made,</HI> Bonellos, Sugar-Canes, Maize, Oranges, Plantains, Mangoe, Yams, <HI>and &s;everal others, all of them of the be&s;t of their kind any where found.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nay there is hardly a Spot of Ground here but what may be cultivated: For even upon the very tops and &s;ides of the Hills and Mountains, there is commonly three or four foot deep of rich
<PB N="104" REF="113">Earth, without &s;o much as a Stone to be found therein. Here is good Hunting and Fowling, and excellent Fi&s;hing in the Bays and Creeks of the Coa&s;t; &s;o that could we improve the Sea&s;on of the Year ju&s;t now begun, we &s;hould &s;oon be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t of our &s;elves; but fortifying and building will lo&s;e us a whole Years planting.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the want of Sloops, or finall Coa&s;ting Ve&s;&s;els, we have hitherto had no opportunity of di&s;po&s;ing any part of the Cargo, or doing other needful things.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Since the lo&s;s of the French Ship mentioned in the Journal, we under&s;tand that the Captain had an underband Corre&s;pon|dence, in tampering with &s;ome of the Natives whom be intended to carry away with him, which hightens our Jealou&s;y that the French have a de&s;ign upon this Place, or at lea&s;t to make a Set|tlement hereabout. And we heartily wi&s;h that our Mo&s;t Gracious King were truly informed of what Con&s;equence it will be both to his Greatne&s;s and Security, to countenance and encourage us his Loyal and Dutiful Subjects here, that our Prince and Country be not only depriv'd of &s;o valuable a Jewel, but lea&s;t the &s;ame &s;hould fall a Prey to &s;ome of our Rival Neighbours. This will be the Companies part to notice after the&s;e Di&s;patches &s;hall come to hand,</HI></P>
<P><HI>You have inclo&s;ed a Li&s;t of &s;everal Goods and Merchandi&s;es vendable and proper for this Place; our Situation being incom|parable for the Trade of the Coa&s;t, where (be&s;ides our Inland Trade) there is commonly but</HI> 2 <HI>or</HI> 3, <HI>or at mo&s;t but</HI> 8 <HI>or</HI> 10 <HI>days &s;ail to the be&s;t Places of Trade upon the Coa&s;t, and to the outmo&s;t con&s;iderable I&s;lands adjoining. And we de&s;ire that particular Merchants in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and el&s;ewhere, may be incouraged to trade and corre&s;pond hither; in which we hope they will &s;uffi|ciently find their Account.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have al&s;o &s;ent you a &s;tate of what Supplies of Provi&s;ions, Stores, and Merchant Goods are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ent &s;upport of the Colony; referring it to the Company to de|termine what rea&s;onable Con&s;ideration they will have for the Sums that &s;hall be advanced for that purpo&s;e: And we entreat, that all po&s;&s;ible Expedition may be us'd in &s;ending us the&s;e needful Supplies; for without that we &s;hall not only be incapable of making you &s;uteable Returns, but this hopeful &V;ndertaking, together with our &s;eives will run no &s;mall ri&s;que of being inevi|tably lo&s;t.

<P>This being from Men who knew the Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the Affair, mu&s;t needs I&s;&s;ue in their own Ruin, can|not be &s;u&s;pected of di&s;ingenuity; and therefore mu&s;t cer|tainly over-balance the Evidence of a Renegado, who owns that he writes out of Malice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t defence he puts in the Company's Mouthis, their being baulk'd of Foreign Sub&s;criptions, which made them lo&s;e Time and Money, whereby they could not &s;end out &s;uch a number of Men and quantity of Provi&s;ions as the Project would have required. This is litterally true, let <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> and his Suborniers an&s;wer it if they can. As for his Que&s;tion, Why did they prodigally throw away 50000 <HI>l</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> purely to make a Blu|&s;ter
<PB N="106" REF="114">there; and why did they tru&s;t to another Man's Pur&s;e till &s;uch time as they are &s;ure of it? We &s;hall an&s;wer by asking him another Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Since he pretends to know the Secrets of the We&s;t end of the Town, why did our Government oppo&s;e our taking Foreign Sub&s;criptions, &s;ince they had impowered us by Acts of Parliament, and Letters Pattent to take them, and &s;ince twas &s;uch a thing as the like perhaps was never done; what rea&s;on had we to &s;u&s;pect being baulk'd of our Foreign Sub&s;crip|tions? He him&s;elf own'd that the Hollanders and Ham|burgers were fond of our Project, till our Government oppos'd us; and therefore, by his own Confe&s;&s;ion, they are to blame for tho&s;e di&s;appointments. As to our taking Sub&s;criptions in <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> We had rea&s;on to engage as many of our Prote&s;tant Neighbours in the De|&s;ign as we could, that we might be the more able to de|fend our &s;elves in ca&s;e of Oppo&s;ition; which is neither ill Policy, nor incon&s;i&s;tent with Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>The 2d Defence he puts in their Mouth, That their Ships were Man'd, no Provi&s;ions to be had in <HI>Scotland,</HI> more were providing abroad, and no more Money to be had from the Sub&s;cribers till once the Ships were Sail'd, is &s;uch as he and his Suborners will never be able to an&s;wer; What could the Company do more, than take care to have Provi&s;ions abroad, when none were to be had at home.? And if the Sub&s;cribers would pay no more Mo|ney till the Ships put to Sea, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of Sail|ing. His Objection as to the &s;hortne&s;s of their Provi&s;ions, we have an&s;wer'd already, and &s;hall add which he mali|ciou&s;ly conceals; That we &s;ent a Ship with Provi&s;ions af|ter them, which was ca&s;t away in <HI>January,</HI> for which we cannot be an&s;werable; and he him&s;elf owns we &s;ent another Convoy in <HI>May;</HI> Then &s;ince the Colony &s;ent us Advice from the <HI>Maderas,</HI> dated <HI>Aug.</HI> 29. That they had &s;till 8 Months large, and twelve Months &s;hort Allowance: The Company cannot ju&s;tly be accus'd of &s;upine Neglect, when they &s;ent away one Ship with Provi&s;ions four Months after this notice, and two more in five Months af|ter that, con&s;idering that they had no Provi&s;ions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as the Libeller him&s;elf owns; and that the Colony had a Car|go which might have bought them Provi&s;ions either from the Natives, if they had any to &s;pare, which we could not doubt of by Mr. <HI>Wafer</HI>'s De&s;cription, or from the Engli&s;h Colonies, had it not not been for the Proclamation, which

<P>To the Cau&s;es he a&s;&s;igns for the Sailing of our Fleer without a greater quantity of Provi&s;ions, we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word">! add one more, <HI>viz.</HI> That we had rea&s;on to fear that our Enemies might prevent us; which Captain <HI>Long</HI>'s being on tho&s;e Coa&s;ts a Month before us, &s;hews was not without Ground; no more than our Su&s;picion, that endeayours were u&s;ed to &s;urprize us into a War with the Spaniards, by <HI>Long</HI>'s Men killing &s;even of them, as hath been already men|tion'd; and of his doing all he could to make us odious to the Natives, by telling them we were Pirates, and di&s;obliging both <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> and <HI>Diego,</HI> by &s;ordid little Acti|ons of his own, as Captain <HI>Pennicook</HI> gave us an Accoun in his Journal. A Grave Member of the Committee of Trade can give a more full Account of this, if he plea&s;es; and when his hand is in, he would do well to a&s;&s;ign us a Rea&s;on why that barbarous Murder committed by <HI>Long</HI>'s Men, was never yet taken notice of by the Spa|niards, &s;ince they have publi&s;hed &s;uch angry Memorials again&s;t us, who committed no Ho&s;tilities upon them.</P>
<P>His Objection to the third and fourth Rea&s;on relating to the Hone&s;ty of our De&s;ign, and the Cargoes not being proper, we have an&s;wer'd already. As for that of our Goods being &s;eizable in <HI>Jamaica</HI> and other Engli&s;h Plantations, by the Act of Navigation, it's one of the Hard&s;hips we ju&s;tly complain of, that was put upon us by the Ene|mics of our Nation in <HI>Charles</HI> II's Reign. But allowing it to be rea&s;onable, it cannot have &s;o much Equity in it, as the Laws which make it puni&s;hable by Death, to Roband Murder. Yet the Execution of tho&s;e are many times di&s;penc'd with in favour of Criminals, by his Maje&s;ty; and indeed a Power to di&s;pence with the Execution of Law &s;ometimes, to &s;ave the Life of a Subject, is one of the mo&s;t Innocent Branches of the Prerogative; but we had much more rea&s;on to have expected a Di&s;pen&s;ation in this Ca&s;e, to &s;ave the Lives of &s;o many of his Subjects, who had generou&s;ly venter'd them for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His owning, <HI>p.</HI> 148. and 154. That a Cargo of Provi&s;ions brought by two <HI>Jamaica</HI> Sloops, was bought by the Colony, be&s;ides as many Turtle as came to 100 and odd Pounds. for which he owns the Colony paid em; not only
<PB N="108" REF="115">contradicts what he &s;ays almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath, <HI>That there was neither Money no Moneys worth to be had in the Co|lony;</HI> and that they laid out all their Stock of Ready Mo|ney for Wine at <HI>Maderas, p.</HI> 48. but may, together with their having both Provi&s;ions and Money when they came to <HI>New York,</HI> ju&s;tly confirm our Su&s;picion, that there was a Mi&s;management of the Provi&s;ions; &s;ince two Sloop's Cargo of Provi&s;ion, 27 Pipes of Wine, 100 Pounds worth of Turtle, the Fi&s;h Plantains, Bonanoes, Potatoes, Indian Corn, Sojours, or Land Crabs, which he &s;ays were plen|tiful at fir&s;t' added to their former Provi&s;ions which they own'd they had at the <HI>Maderas;</HI> together with the de|crea&s;e of their Number of Men by Death was not enough to keep their Colony from &s;tarving for Nine Months. We have &s;till the more rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect this, becau&s;e the Let|ter from <HI>New York,</HI> which brought us the fir&s;t certain Ac|count of the Di&s;a&s;ter of our Colony, hinted as if <HI>there might be &s;ome Work for the Hangman.</HI> That there were more ill Men in the Colony than <HI>H&mdash;s</HI> is probable e|nough: and particularly that <HI>Pennicook</HI> was brib'd to rai&s;e Divi&s;ions in the Colony, and put all in di&s;order by his In|&s;olence: which falling in with the Proclamations that were concerted for our De&s;truction, gave a handle to o|ther ill Men to foment the Divi&s;ions, and compleat the Ruin of the Colony by a total De&s;ertion.</P>
<P>His In&s;inuation, <HI>P.</HI> 154, That two <HI>Jamaica</HI> Sloops with Provi&s;ions return'd from the Colony without breaking bulk, becau&s;e there was neither Money nor Market Goods there; de&s;erves better Evidence than his own be|fore it obtain Credit. We have indeed heard of one Ve&s;|&s;el with Provi&s;ions, which in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch extravagant Rates, that the Colony would not incourage them to do the like in time to come; and therefore would not deal with them: hoping that their own Convoy might &s;peedily come up; but this was before they knew any thing of the Ploclamation, which cut off all their future hopes, ev'n from <HI>Scotland.</HI> We have al&s;o Letters from <HI>New York,</HI> that the Government of that Place &s;eem'd to intend them no good; of which their de&s;iring our Ships to come and Anchor under the Guns of the Ca&s;tle, is a clear Proof; and the rea&s;on of this unkind Treatment is al&s;o explain'd to us, <HI>viz.</HI> That they &s;u&s;pected our Men had a de&s;ign to return back as &s;oon as they got Provi&s;ions. Nay, we
<PB N="109" REF="115">have had advice, that their Gold Du&s;t was actually re&s;us'd at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> becau&s;e of the Proclamations which we have rea&s;on enough to believe: &s;ince we cannot think that the It habitants there would be willing to incurr the height of His Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure to oblige the Scots. That our Men had Gold Du&s;t from the Natives for Powder, Shot, and &s;peckled Shifts: the Libeller owns him&s;elf, <HI>P.</HI> 149. and there he brags of it, that he brought off more him|&s;elf at 3 <HI>l</HI> 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Ounce, (how he came by it, is worth the inquiry) than mo&s;t of the Councellors that are come home &s;ince; and by Letters from <HI>New York,</HI> we have heard there was Money among&s;t them: By all which 'tis evident, That want of Money or Goods was not the &s;ole Cau&s;e of their being demed Provi&s;ions from the Engli&s;h Plantations. His In&s;inuation, that the French and Dutch I&s;lands would have &s;upplied us if we had had Money or Goods, is ridiculous; when the Government of both tho&s;e Nations had &s;o expre&s;ly declared them&s;elves again&s;t us.</P>
<P>His All gation in that &s;ame Page, that His Maje&s;ty knew nothing of the Colonies Settlement at <HI>Darien,</HI> but what he had at &s;econd hand, &amp;c. till the Spanith Amba&s;&s;a|dur told him from his Ma&s;ter, is &s;o notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, that none but a Per&s;on of his Forehead could have advanced it, when the World knows that the Proclamation again&s;t us was publi&s;h'd in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> and the Spani&s;h Memorial was not deliver'd till <HI>May</HI> following. We &s;hould indeed be very glad to find that His Maje&s;ty knew no|thing of tho&s;e Proclamations; and that his Name was made u&s;e of without his Con&s;ent; as &s;ome &s;ay his Grandfathers was in the Iri&s;h Ma&s;&s;acre: for then we might rea&s;onably expect &s;peedy Ju&s;tice upon tho&s;e bold Offenders, who dar'd to publi&s;h &s;uch Proclamations in His Maje&s;ty's Name, wherein we are condemned; as having invaded the Spa|nish D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">maniens before ever it was heard what we could &s;ay for our &s;elves, or without giving us any notice of tho&s;e Proclamations, that we might have taken care to have pre|&s;erv'd our Men from being &s;tarv'd to death by them: By which they have made our Prince to act more like our de|clared Enemy, than one that we had con&s;tantly lov'd and rever'd as Father of his Country: and that which is yet more cutting; they &s;till prevail to mi&s;lead him, &s;o as he continues his unnatural Oppo&s;ition to us: For be&s;ides the Proclamations formerly mentioned, another has been &s;ince
<PB N="110" REF="116">publi&s;h'd again&s;t us in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 15, which is &s;o much the more unaccountable; con&s;idering the Memo|rial given in by our Pre&s;ident and Advocate, ju&s;tifying our Preten&s;ions which the Spaniards have never yet offered to an&s;wer. By means of this Proclamation, the St. <HI>Andrew</HI> was denied Relief when &s;he fell in with Admirel <HI>Bembo,</HI> who told her, tho they &s;hould all &s;tarve he could allow them none, and the like an&s;wer they had from the Gover|nor of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> tho they offer'd Goods in Exchange; the like Oppo&s;ition is al&s;o continued again&s;t us at home; for tho the Company have addre&s;s'd His Maje&s;ty, yet'tis without effect. After a full Repre&s;entation of their Lo&s;&s;es, they did wi&s;ely and dutifully de&s;ire the Parliament might meet, that being the propore&s;t way to have the &s;inking Honour of the Company &s;upported; but His Maje&s;ty in&s;tead of grant|ing their rea&s;onable de&s;ires, was prevail'd upon by tho&s;e who are Enemies to our Country, to prorogue it further at the very time when they knew the Addre&s;s was coming up, and all the An&s;wer thought &s;it to give them, is, <HI>That His Maje&s;ty is &s;orry for the lo&s;s of his Ancient Kingdom and of the Company, that they &s;hall have the &s;ame liberty to trade to the</HI> We&s;t-Indies <HI>as formerly; and that he will call the Par|liament when he thinks the good of the Nation requires it,</HI> or to that effect. It may ea&s;ily be judged, that this An|&s;wer could be no way &s;atisfactory to the Company in &s;uch a Juncture: nor are we to wonder, if in&s;tead of cheering their Spirits, it &s;truck them dumb, and fill'd them with Amaze|ment. We wi&s;h that tho&s;e who advi&s;e His Maje&s;ty to &s;uch a Conduct towards the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who have ne|ver been backward in te&s;tifying their Loyalty and Affecti|on to his Per&s;on and Government; would con&s;ider that this is a downright Violation of our Con&s;titution. It's certain that none are &s;o proper to give his Maje&s;ty advice, when a Parliament is nece&s;&s;ary as our own Nobility Gen|try and Burrowghs, who are mo&s;t of them concern'd in our Company: and therefore their Addre&s;s ought to haye been more regarded than the advice of any particular Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>This fal&s;e Method of Government hath ruin'd many of our Princes, and we wi&s;h that tho&s;e who put his Maje&s;ty upon &s;uch Mea&s;ures, may not have his ruin in pro&s;pect. It is certain they can be none of his Friends, who put him upon di&s;|obliging of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in this manner.</P>
<P>We come next to the Libeller's Defence of the Spani&s;h
<PB N="111" REF="116">Title to <HI>Darien,</HI> p. 163. His fir&s;t Argument, That the Spaniards Title to that Country was never hitherto di&s;pu|ted by any Prince or State, is a downright Fal&s;hood. The <HI>Darien</HI> Princes them&s;elves controverted it always, and their Plea was allow'd to be good by the Judges of <HI>England,</HI> as we have been fore'd to tell this Renegado and his Suborners again and again. The Title of the Spaniards as Conque|rours to any part of <HI>America,</HI> is not only doubted by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cheapo, Don Bartholomew de Los Ca&s;as,</HI> mention'd in the Defence of the Scots Settlement, but &s;trenuou&s;ly argu'd again&s;t and maitain'd to be unlawful, in his Propo&s;itions concerning the Title of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> propos'd to the Con&s;ideration of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> him&s;elf. In his ninth Propo&s;ition he a&s;&s;erts, <Q>That when Chri&s;tian Princes apply their Endeavours to propagate the Faith, they ought to have no Con&s;ideration for any thing but the Service of God&mdash;Or if they can do any thing for the advantage of their Dominions while they augment the Kingdom of Chri&s;t: It ought to be without any con&s;iderable prejudice to the Infidels or the Princes that Govern them&mdash;<HI>Prop.</HI> 10. He a&s;&s;erts, They have their own lawful Kings and Princes, who have a Right to to make Laws, &amp;<HI>c.</HI>&mdash; For the good Government of their re&s;pective Dominions, &s;o that they cannot beexpell'd out of 'em, or depriv'd of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, without do|ing Violence to the Laws of God as well as the Law of Nations. <HI>Prop.</HI> 26. Seeing the Spaniards have not been &s;upported either by the Authority of their Prince, or any lawful Rea&s;on to make War again&s;t the Indians, who liv'd peaceably in their own Country, and had done the Spaniard no wrong; all &s;uch Conque&s;ts that have been or may hereafter be made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> are to be accounted Unju&s;t, Tyranical and Null, being condemned by all the Laws of God and Men.</Q> Its true he &s;uppo&s;es the K. of <HI>Spain</HI> to have a Title to the Sove|raignty of the Indies, by the Popes Grant; but it is with &s;uch Re&s;trictions as tho&s;e he mentions; and in his 16 Pro|po&s;ition &s;ays the Pope, has power to revoke it, if it be found prejudicial to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Faith; and he expre&s;ly declares throughout his Book, that all the Me|thods taken by the Spaniards were &s;uch, &s;o that here's one &s;trong Evidence of their own again&s;t them.&mdash;<HI>Dominicus de Soto;</HI> the K. of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;or at the time &s;cems by his &s;umming up the Di&s;pute betwixt this Bi&s;hop and
<PB N="112" REF="117">Dr. <HI>Sepulveda</HI> to have been of the &s;ame Opinion; and <HI>Sepulveda</HI>'s Books, maintaining the contrary were &s;nppre&s;s'd by the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame Opinion, and indeed more expre&s;s again&s;t the Methods, by which the Spaniards acquir'd their Dominions in the Indies, is, <HI>Franci&s;cus a Victoria,</HI> chief Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> (whom the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. con&s;ulted in Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience, and in this among&s;t others) as may be &s;een in his <HI>Relectiones, Theologicae, Relectione 5. de Indis</HI> where he argues the Point at large, and in <HI>Relect.</HI> 7. <HI>de jure bell,</HI> lays down this as a Maxim, <HI>That an Injury receiv'd is the only ju&s;t Cau&s;e of making War.</HI> So that it being plain from Matter of Fact that the Indians did no manner of Injury to the Spaniards; their War upon them mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity by this Argumnt be unlawful. More has been &s;aid already in Vindication of our Tide, in the defence of the Scots Settlement, than the Renegado and his Su|borners can an&s;wer; therefore we &s;hall wind up this Matter in a few Words more.</P>
<P>His alledging we might as well land in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where the wild Negroes have de&s;erted their Ma&s;ters, or in <HI>Tobago, &amp;c.</HI> &s;erve only to di&s;cover his own Folly. There's no unconquer'd Natives, who have their own Princes to govern them in either of tho&s;e I&s;lands, nor are the Titles of the Engli&s;h and D. of <HI>Curland,</HI> to tho&s;e Places que&s;tion'd. The Iri&s;h having admitted French Troops into their Kingdom is as little to the purpo&s;e, &s;ince they have had no &s;hadow of Government or Sovereignty, left them for &s;everal Ages, have from time to time &s;ubmitted to the Government of <HI>England,</HI> and admitted tho&s;e Troops in defence of the late K. <HI>James</HI>'s Title, which he derives from <HI>Hen.</HI> II. that Conqner'd them. Be&s;ides, the Libeller him&s;selt owns, p. 54. that the Natives them&s;elves were pleas'd with the hopes of being re&s;tor'd by us to their Ancient Liberty and Greatne&s;s; and p. 55. That <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> one of their greate&s;t Cap|tains, was at War with the Spaniards before our Arrival. His al|leaging that Cap. <HI>Andreas</HI> was a Spani&s;h Captain at the time of our Landing, needs better proof than his affertion: that he might be then at Peace with the Spaniards, and have &s;ome re&s;pect for them becau&s;e of his being bred among them, as <HI>H</HI>&mdash;&s;ays he was, p. 60. all that they then gave him a Commi&s;&s;ion as a Captain, does not at all argue that he was in the Spani&s;h Intere&s;t when we Landed, or any way &s;ubject to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> if he him&s;elf promi&s;ed &s;ubjection, it does not dive&s;t his Subjects of their Right, and that <HI>An|dreas</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;lor and they were no Friends to the Spaniards, is evident from the Libeller's own Story, that they gave cur Colony motice of the Spani&s;h Party that came to view them, and led them to the place where they were: We have likwi&s;e the Te&s;timony of all that have writ of this Place, again&s;t the Renegado, be&s;ides that of the Journals of our own Colony, which give an Account that <HI>An bro&s;io</HI> had engag'd all his Neighbouring Princes in a League a|gain&s;t the Spaniard, before our Arrival.</P>
