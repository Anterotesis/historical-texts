<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Lord Marque&s;&s;e OF DORCHESTER.</HEAD>
<P>_IHere pre&s;ent unto your Lord&s;hip the <HI>Fruits,</HI> if not the Follies al&s;o, of my younger daies, not publi&s;hed now, if the audaciou&s;ne&s;&s;e of &s;ome others had not made that <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> which in my own
<PB REF="3">
thoughts was e&s;teemed <HI>un&s;ea&s;onable.</HI> The rea&s;ons why I have no &s;ooner publi&s;hed the&s;e Relations, and tho&s;e which have inforced me to do it now, are laid down in the following Preface, &s;ufficient (as I hope) both to excu&s;e and ju&s;tifie me with ingenuous men. But for my boldne&s;&s;e in giving them the countenance of your Lord&s;hips name, I &s;hall not &s;tudy other rea&s;ons then a de&s;ire to render to your Lord|&s;hip &s;ome acknowledgement of tho&s;e many fair expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and favour, which your Lord&s;hip from my fir&s;t coming to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> hath vouch&s;afed unto me. Your known abilities in mo&s;t parts of learning, to|gether with the great re&s;pects you have for tho&s;e which pretend unto it, encli|ned you to embrace &s;uch opinion of me, as was more an&s;werable to your
<PB REF="3">
own goodne&s;&s;e then to my de&s;ert, and to cheri&s;h in me tho&s;e Proficiencies, which were more truly in your &s;elf. And for my part, I alwaies looked up|on your Lord&s;hip as a true Son of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> devoted zealou&s;ly to her Forms of wor&s;hip, the ortho|doxies of her Doctrine, and the Apo|&s;tolici&s;m of her Government; which makes me confident that the&s;e pieces will not prove unwelcome to you, in which the &s;uper&s;titions &amp; innovations of the two oppo&s;ite parties, are with an equal hand laid open to your Lord|&s;hips view. Nor &s;hall you find in the&s;e Relations, &s;uch matters of compliance only with your Lord&s;hip in point of Judgement, as promi&s;e &s;atisfaction un|to your intellectuall, and more noble parts; but many things which may af|ford you entertainments of a different
<PB REF="4">
nature, when you are either &s;pent with &s;tudy, or wearied with affairs of more near importance. For here you have the principalle&s;t Cities and faire&s;t Provinces of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;ented in as lively colours, as my unpoli&s;hed hand could give them; the Temper, Hu|mour and Affections of the People, generally deciphered with a free and impartial Pen; the publick Govern|ment of the whole, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, de&s;cribed more punctually then ever heretofore in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue; &s;ome ob&s;ervations intermingled of more ancient learning, but pertinent and proper to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e which I had in hand.

<PB REF="4">
that your Lord&s;hip may finde cau&s;e to wonder, how I could &s;ay &s;o much on &s;o &s;mall a &s;ubject, if the great alterations which have hapned there in bringing in and working out the <HI>Genevian Di&s;cipline,</HI> had not occa&s;io|ned the&s;e enlargements.

<HEAD>The Authors Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. _IT may &s;eem &s;trange unto the Reader, that after &s;o large a volume of <HI>Co&s;mography,</HI> in which the world was made the &s;ubject of my Travels, I &s;hould de&s;cend unto the publi&s;hing of the&s;e <HI>Relations,</HI> which point at the e&s;tate only of &s;ome neighbouring places: or that in the&s;e declining times of my life and fortunes, I &s;hould take plea&s;ure in communicating &s;uch <HI>Compo&s;itions,</HI> as were the products of my youth, and therefore proba|bly not able to endure the cen&s;ure of &s;everer age. And to &s;ay truth, there are &s;ome things in this <HI>pub|lication,</HI> whereof I think my &s;elf obliged to give an account to him that &s;hall read the&s;e papers, as well for his &s;atisfaction as mine own di&s;charge; as namely touching the occa&s;ion of the&s;e &s;everal Journeys, my different manner of proceeding in the&s;e Relations, the rea&s;ons why not publi&s;hed &s;ooner, and the impul&s;ions which have moved me to produce them now.</P>
<P N="2">II. For the two fir&s;t, the Reader may be plea&s;ed to know, that as I undertook the fir&s;t Journey, in the company of a private friend, only to &s;atisfie my &s;elf in taking a brief view of the plea|&s;ures and delights of <HI>France;</HI> &s;o having plea&s;ed my
<PB REF="6">
&s;elf in the &s;ight thereof, and in the ob&s;ervation of &s;uch things as were mo&s;t con&s;iderable, I re&s;olved to give my &s;elf the plea&s;ure of making &s;uch a character and de&s;cription of them, as were then mo&s;t agreeable to my pre&s;ent humour, at what time both my wits and fancies (if ever I was ma&s;ter of any) were in their predominancy. I was then free from all engagements, depending meerly on my &s;elf, not having fa&s;tned my relations upon any one man, in order to my fu|ture preferment in Church or State, and therefore thought of nothing el&s;e then a &s;elf-complacency, and the contentment of indulging to mine own affections. This made me to take that liberty in deciphering the tempers, humours, and behaviours of the <HI>French</HI> Na|tion generally, which to a grave judgement may &s;eem too luxuriant, and to have more in it of the <HI>Saty|ri&s;t,</HI> then is con&s;i&s;tent with an equall and imparti|all character. But in the mid&s;t of &s;o much folly (if the Reader &s;hall vouch&s;afe it no better name) there is &s;uch a mixture of more &s;erious matters, as makes the temperature of the whole be more delightfull; ac|cording to that &s;aying of <HI>Horace</HI> in his Book <HI>de Arte Poetica:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Omne tulit punctum, qui mi&s;cuit utile dulci.</L></Q>
<P>That is to &s;ay,</P>
<Q><L>He hits on every point aright,</L>
<L>Who mingleth profit with delight.</L></Q>
<P N="3">III. The other Journey being undertaken almo&s;t four years after, in attendance on the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> is
<PB REF="6">
fa&s;hioned after a more &s;erious and &s;olemn manner. I had then began to apply my &s;elf to the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and was re&s;olved to pre&s;ent the work to him, when it was once fini&s;hed, and therefore was to frame my &s;tyle agreeably unto the gravity and com|po&s;edne&s;&s;e of &s;o great a Prelate. My de&s;ign was to let him &s;ee in the whole body and contexture of that di&s;cour&s;e, that I was not altogether uncapable of mana|ging &s;uch publick bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, as he might afterwards think fit to entru&s;t me with; and it &s;ucceeded &s;o well with me, that within a &s;hort time after he recommended me unto his Maje&s;ty for a Chaplain in ordinary, and by degrees employed me in affairs of &s;uch weight and moment, as rendred my &s;ervice not unu&s;efull to the Church and State; however mi&s;taken by &s;ome men, who think all matters ill conducted, which either pa&s;&s;e not through their own hands, or are not managed by their &s;ini&s;ter and precipitate coun&s;els. This makes the &s;tyle and language of the &s;econd Journey to be &s;o different from the fir&s;t. The indi&s;cretion would have been impardonable, if I had come before &s;uch a per|&s;on in &s;o light a garb, as might have given him a ju&s;t occa&s;ion to &s;uppo&s;e, that I had too much of the Antick, and might be rather &s;erviceable to his recrea|tions, then to be honoured with employments of more weight and con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If it be asked, why the&s;e Relations were not publi|&s;hed a&s;&s;oon as they pa&s;&s;ed my hands, and might be thought more &s;ea&s;onable, then they are at this pre&s;ent; the An&s;wer in a manner may prevent the que&s;tion. The la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, being written, and intended purpo&s;ely as a Pre&s;ent to that great Prelate whom before I &s;poke of, could not with any fitne&s;&s;e, be communicated to the
<PB REF="7">
publick view without his con&s;ent. For having tendred it unto him, it was no more mine, and not being mine, I had no rea&s;on to di&s;po&s;e otherwi&s;e of it, as long as the property thereof was ve&s;ted in him by mine own free act. But he being laid to &s;leep in the bed of peace, I conceive my &s;elf to have gotten &s;uch a &s;econd right therein, as the <HI>Granter</HI> hath many times in Law, when there is no Heir left of the <HI>Grantee</HI> to enjoy the gift, and con&s;equently to lay any claim unto it. And being re&s;olved, upon the rea&s;ons hereafter following, to publi&s;h the fir&s;t of the&s;e two Journals, I thought it not ami&s;&s;e to let this al&s;o wait upon it, &s;econd in place, as it had been &s;econd in performance and cour&s;e of time.</P>
<P N="5">V. So for the fir&s;t Journey, being dige&s;ted and com|mitted unto writing for mine own contentment, with|out the thought of plea&s;ing any body el&s;e; the keep|ing of it by me did as much conduce to the end pro|po&s;ed, as if it had been publi&s;hed to the view of others. And I had &s;till &s;atisfied my &s;elf in enjoying that end, if the importunity of friends (who were willing to put them&s;elves to that charge and trouble) had not drawn &s;ome copies of it from me. By means whereof it came unto more hands then I ever meant it, and at the la&s;t into &s;uch hands, by which it would have been pre&s;ented to the publick view without my con&s;ent; and that too with &s;uch faults and errors, as <HI>Tran&s;cripts</HI> of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be &s;ubject to when not compared with the Original, or peru&s;ed by the Author. And had it hapned &s;o, as it was like enough to happen, and hath hapned &s;ince, the faults and errors of the Copy, as well as of the Pre&s;&s;e, would have pa&s;&s;ed for mine&punc; and I mu&s;t have been thought accomptable for tho&s;e
<PB REF="7">
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which the ignorance and unadvi&s;edne&s;&s;e of other men would have drawn upon me. And yet there was &s;ome other rea&s;on, which made the publi&s;h|ing of that Journal when fir&s;t fini&s;hed by me, not &s;o fit nor &s;afe, nor &s;o conducible to &s;ome ends, which I had in view. I had before applyed my &s;elf unto his Maje&s;ty, when Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by Dedicating to him the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ayes of my <HI>Co&s;mographie;</HI> and thereby opened for my &s;elf a pa&s;&s;age into the Court, when&s;o|ever I &s;hould have a minde to look that way. And at the time when I had fini&s;hed the&s;e <HI>Relations,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> party there were as con&s;iderable for their num|ber, as it was afterwards for their power: and the di&s;cour&s;e fa&s;hioned with &s;o much liberty, and touching (as it might be thought) with &s;o much <HI>Gayete de coeur</HI> upon the humours of that people, might have pro|cured me no good welcome; and proved but an un|hand&s;ome harbinger, to take up any good lodging for me in that place, when either my &s;tudies &s;hould enable, or my ambition prompt me to a&s;pire unto it. Which cau&s;es being now removed, I conceive the time to be more &s;ea&s;onable now, then it was at the fir&s;t, and that the&s;e papers may more confidently walk the open &s;treets, without giving any ju&s;t offence to my &s;elf or others.</P>
<P N="6">VI. For though perhaps it may be &s;aid, that I have made too bold with the <HI>French,</HI> and that my character of that people, hath too much of the <HI>Satyri&s;t</HI> in it, as be|fore was intimated; yet I conceive that no &s;ober minded man either of that Nation or of this, will finde him&s;elf aggrieved at my freedome in it. The <HI>French</HI> and other forein Nations make as bold with us, not &s;paring to lay open our wants and weakne&s;&s;es, even
<PB REF="8">
without occa&s;ion, and offering them by &s;uch multiply|ing Gla&s;&s;es to the &s;ight of others, as render them far greater then indeed they are. Men of facetious fancies and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">coffing wits (as the <HI>French</HI> generally are) mu&s;t not expect to be alwaies on the offering hand, but be content to take &s;uch money as they u&s;e to give; there would be el&s;e no living neer them, or conver&s;ing with them. <HI>Hanc veniam petimu&s;&abque; damu&s;&abque; vici&s;sim,</HI> in the Poets language. Be&s;ides the reader mu&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;h betwixt the inclinations of nature, and corrupti|ons in manners. Natural inclinations may be de&s;cri|bed under a free and liberal character, without any wrong unto the Nations which are &s;o de&s;cribed: nor is it more to the di&s;honour of the <HI>French,</HI> to &s;ay that they are airy, light, <HI>Mercurial,</HI> a&s;&s;oon lo&s;t as found; then to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> to be accounted &s;low, and <HI>Sa|turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ne,</HI> lofty and proud, even in the lowe&s;t ebb of a beggerly fortune. The temperature of the &s;oyle and air, together with the influences of the heavenly bodies, occa&s;ion that variety of temper and affections in all different Nations, which can be no reproach un|to them, when no corruption of manners, no vice in matter of morality is charged upon them. <HI>Hinc illa ab antiquo vitia, et patriae &s;orte durantia, quae totas in hi&s;toriis gentes aut commendant aut notant,</HI> &s;aith a mo|dern but judicious Author. The pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> had not been el&s;e &s;o like the <HI>Galls</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tories, had not tho&s;e influences, and other naturall cau&s;es be|fore remembred, produced the &s;ame natural inclinati|ons, and impul&s;ions in them, as they had effected in the other; their own <HI>Du Bartas</HI> &s;aith as much touching this particular, as he is thus tran&s;lated by <HI>Jo&s;uah Sylve|&s;ter.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>

<L>O &s;ee how full of wonders &s;trange is nature,</L>

</LG></Q>
<P N="6">VI Much le&s;&s;e would I be thought injurious to the fe|male &s;ex, though I have u&s;ed the like freedome in my character of them. I doubt not but there are among&s;t them, many gallant women, of mo&s;t exemplary vir|tue, and unque&s;tioned cha&s;tity; and I believe the grea|te&s;t part are &s;uch indeed, though their behaviour at fir&s;t &s;ight might, to a man untravelled, per&s;wade the con|trary. But general characters are to be fitted to the temper and condition of a people generally, unto the <HI>Genera&s;ingulorum,</HI> as <HI>Logicians</HI> phra&s;e it, though po&s;|&s;ibly (as there are few general Rules without &s;ome ex|ceptions) many particular per&s;ons both of rank and merit, may challenge an exemption from them:</P>
<Q><HI>Queis meliore luto finxit praecordia</HI> Titan.</Q>
<Q><L>To whom the heavens have made a bre&s;t</L>
<L>Of choicer metall then the re&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>And it is po&s;&s;ible enough I might have been more &s;paring of that liberty which I then gave unto my &s;elf, were there occa&s;ion to make a &s;econd character of
<PB REF="9">
them at this pre&s;ent time; or had I not thought fit to have offered this di&s;cour&s;e without alteration, as it fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued from my pen. Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> women at that time were of a more retired behaviour then they have been &s;ince, which made the confident carriage of the <HI>French Damo&s;els,</HI> &s;eem more &s;trange unto me, whereas of late the garbe of our women is &s;o altered, and they have &s;o much in them of the mode of <HI>France,</HI> as ea&s;ily might take off tho&s;e mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, with which I was really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at my fir&s;t coming thither. So much doth cu&s;tome alter the true face of things, that it makes many things approvable, which at the fir&s;t ap|peared un&s;ightly.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In the next place it may be &s;aid that this &s;hort Jour|nall de&s;erves not to be called <HI>A SURVEY OF THE STATE OF FRANCE,</HI> con&s;idering that it only treat|eth of &s;ome particular Provinces, and of &s;uch Towns and Cities only in tho&s;e Provinces, as came within the compa&s;&s;e of a per&s;onal view. But then it may be &s;aid withall, that the&s;e four Provinces which I pa&s;&s;ed thorow, and de&s;cribe, may be con&s;idered as the <HI>Epi|tome</HI> of the whole, the ab&s;tract or compendium of the Body of <HI>France:</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>France</HI> being look|ed on as the mother of <HI>Paris, Picardie</HI> as the chiefe&s;t <HI>Granary,</HI> and <HI>La Beau&s;e</HI> as the nur&s;e thereof; as <HI>Nor|mandy</HI> is e&s;teemed for the Bulwark of all <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf by rea&s;on of that large Sea-coa&s;t, and well fortified Ha|vens, wherewith it doth confront the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And if the rule be true in <HI>Logick</HI> (as I think it is) that a De|nomination may be taken from the nobler parts; then certainly a <HI>Survey</HI> of the&s;e four Provinces, the noble&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of all that Kingdome, may be entituled without any ab&s;urdity the Survey of <HI>France.</HI>
<PB REF="9">
For be&s;ides that which hath been &s;poken, it was in the&s;e four Provinces that <HI>Henry</HI> the 4. did lay the &s;cene of his long war again&s;t the <HI>Leaguers,</HI> as if in keeping them a&s;&s;ured or &s;ubjected to him the &s;afety of the whole Kingdome did con&s;i&s;t e&s;pecially. For though the war was carried into mo&s;t other Provinces as the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs required, yet it was managed in tho&s;e Provinces by particular parties. Neither the King him&s;elf, nor the Duke of <HI>Mayenne</HI> (the heads of the contending Armies) did act any thing in them except &s;ome light velitations in <HI>Champagne,</HI> and one excur&s;ion into <HI>Burgundie;</HI> the whole deci&s;ion of the quarrels, depending principally, if not wholly, in the getting of the&s;e. The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> had not el&s;e made &s;o long a march from the Court of <HI>Bruxels,</HI> to rai&s;e the Kings Army from the &s;iege of <HI>Roven;</HI> nor had the King mu&s;tered up all his wit and power to recover <HI>Amiens,</HI> when dexterou&s;ly &s;urprized by a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> &s;tratagem. And if it be true, which the <HI>French</HI> generally affirm of <HI>Paris,</HI> that it is the Eye, nay the very Soul of all <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf; I may with confidence affirm, that I have given more &s;ight to that Eye, more life and &s;pirit to that Soul, then hath been hitherto com|municated in the Engli&s;h. Tongue. The Realm of <HI>France</HI> &s;urveyed in the four principal Provinces, and the chief Cities of the whole, gives a good colour to the <HI>title,</HI> and yet the title hath more colour to in&s;i&s;t upon, then the de&s;cription of the&s;e Cities, and tho&s;e principal Pro|vinces, can contribute towards it. For though I have de&s;cribed tho&s;e four Provinces only in the way of Chorography, yet I have took a general and <HI>a full Sur|vey of the State of</HI> France, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, which are the three
<PB REF="10">
main limbs of all <HI>Bodies Politick,</HI> and took it in &s;o full a manner, as I think none, and am a&s;&s;ured that very few have done before me.</P>
<P N="9">IX. If it be &s;aid that my &s;tay was not long enough to ren|der me exact and punctual in my ob&s;ervations: I hope it will be &s;aid withall, that the le&s;&s;e my &s;tay was, my diligence mu&s;t be the greater, and that I husbanded my time to the be&s;t advantage. For knowing that we could not &s;tay there longer, then our money la&s;ted, and that we carried not the wealth of the <HI>Indies</HI> with us, I was re&s;olved to give my &s;elf as little re&s;t, as the nece&s;&s;ities of nature could di&s;pen&s;e withall; and &s;o to work my &s;elf into the good opinions of &s;ome prin|cipal per&s;ons of that nation, who were be&s;t able to inform me, as might in &s;hort &s;pace furni&s;h me with &s;uch in&s;tructions, as others with a greater expence both of time and money could not &s;o readily attain. By this accommodating of my &s;elf unto the humours of &s;ome men, and a re&s;olution not to be wanting to that curio&s;ity which I carryed with me, there was nothing which I de&s;ired to know (and there was nothing which I de&s;ired not to know) but what was readily imparted to me both with love and chearfulne&s;&s;e. <HI>Cur ne&s;cire pudens prave quam di&s;cere mallem?</HI> I alwaies looked upon it as a greater &s;hame to be ignorant of any thing, then to be taught by any body; and therefore made &s;uch u&s;e of men of both Religions, as were mo&s;t like|ly to acquaint me with the coun&s;els of their &s;everall parties. Nor was I pur&s;e-bound when I had occa&s;i|on to &s;ee any of tho&s;e Rarities, Reliques, and matters of more true antiquity, which either their Religious Hou&s;es, Churches, Colledges, yea, or the Court it Self could pre&s;ent unto me.

<P N="10">X. In the la&s;t place it may be &s;aid that many things have hapned both in the Court and State of <HI>France,</HI> many great revolutions and alterations in the face thereof, &s;ince I dige&s;ted the Relation of this Journey for my own contentment; which makes this publication the more un&s;ea&s;onable, and my con&s;ent unto it &s;ubject to the greater cen&s;ure: which notwith&s;tanding I con|ceive that the di&s;cour&s;e will be as u&s;efull to the inge|nuous Reader, as if it had gone &s;heet by &s;heet from the <HI>Pen</HI> to the <HI>Pre&s;&s;e,</HI> and had been offered to him in that point of time when it took life from me. The learned labours of <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> in his Chorography of <HI>Greece,</HI> are as delightful now to the &s;tudious Reader, as formerly to the be&s;t wits of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens.</HI> Nor need we doubt, but that the de&s;cription of the <HI>Nether|lands</HI> by <HI>Lewis Guicciardine,</HI> and of the I&s;les of <HI>Bri|tain</HI> by our famous <HI>Camden,</HI> will yeeld as great pro|fit and contentment to future Ages, as to the men that knew the Authors. The Realm of <HI>France</HI> is &s;till the &s;ame, the temperature of the air and &s;oyl the &s;ame, the humours and affections of the people &s;till the &s;ame; the Fractions of the Church as great, the Govern|ment as Regal or de&s;potical now, as when the Au|thor was among&s;t them. The Cities &s;tand in the &s;ame places which before they &s;tood in, and the Rivers keep the &s;ame channels which before they had, no altera|tion in the <HI>natural</HI> parts of that great body, and not much in the <HI>politick</HI> neither. The change which &s;ince hath hapned by the Death of the King, being rather in the per&s;on of the Prince, then the form of Govern|ment. Affairs of State then managed by a Queen-Mother,
<PB REF="11">
and a Cardinal favourite, as they are at this pre&s;ent. The King in his Majority then, but not much ver&s;ed or &s;tudied in his own concernments, as he is at this pre&s;ent; the Realm divided then into par|ties and factions (though not into the &s;ame factions) as it is at this pre&s;ent; and finally, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> then in as high e&s;teem, by rea&s;on of the alliance then newly made between the Princes, as they can po&s;&s;ibly be now, by rea&s;on of the late concluded peace be|twixt the Nations. Nor hath there hapned any thing not reconcilable to the pre&s;ent times, but the almo&s;t miraculous birth of the King and his Brother after 20 years barrenne&s;&s;e, and the mariage of the Mon&s;ieur with <HI>Montpen&s;iers</HI> Daughter, contrary to the gene|rall expectation of all that people, and for the fir&s;t (I think I may be bold to &s;ay) of the world be|&s;ides.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The&s;e rea&s;ons as they may excu&s;e this publication, in reference to the work it &s;elf, &s;o there is one which &s;erves to ju&s;tifie it in re&s;pect of the Author; that is to &s;ay, the manife&s;ting of this truth to all which &s;hall peru&s;e the&s;e papers, that he is &s;till of the &s;ame Judge|ment, and opinion in matters of Religion, Gods wor|&s;hip, and the government of holy Church, of which he was 30 years agoe, when the Relation of the fir&s;t Journey was fa&s;hioned by him; that he hath &s;tood his ground in all tho&s;e revolutions both of Church and State, which have hapned &s;ince; that he now holds no other <HI>Tenets,</HI> then tho&s;e to which he hath been principled by education, and confirmed by &s;tudy; and finally that &s;uch opinions as he holds, be they right or wrong, he brought to the Court with him, and took not from thence. So that what&s;oever
<PB REF="11">
other imputation may be charged upon him, he can|not be accu&s;ed for a time-&s;erver, but alwaies con&s;tant to him&s;elf, in all times the &s;ame; <HI>Qualis ab incepto proce&s;&s;eri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> in the Poets language, the &s;ame man then as now without alteration Compare my late book upon the <HI>Creed,</HI> with the&s;e pre&s;ent <HI>Journals,</HI> and it will ea&s;ily be &s;een, that in all points wherein I have occa&s;ion to declare my Judgement, I am nothing altered; that neither the temptations of preferment, nor that great turn both in the publick and my own affairs which hath hapned &s;ince; have made me other then I was at the very fir&s;t.</P>

In the Relation of the &s;econd Journey, I finde no mi&s;takes, requiring any Animadver&s;ions, as written in a riper judgement, and with greater care, becau&s;e intended to a per&s;on of &s;uch known abilities.

<P>_ON Tue&s;day the 28 of <HI>June,</HI> ju&s;t at the time when <HI>England</HI> had received the chief beauty of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had &s;een the choi&s;e beauties of <HI>England;</HI> we went to Sea in a Bark of <HI>Dover.</HI> The Port we aimed at, <HI>Dieppe</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> The hour three in the after|noon. The winde faire and high, able, had it continued in
<PB N="2" REF="26">
that point, to have given us a wa&s;tage as &s;peedy as our longings. Two hours before night it came about to the We&s;tward, and the tide al&s;o not befriending us, our pa&s;&s;age became tedious and trouble&s;ome. The next day being de|dicated to the glory of God in the memory of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> we took the benefit of the ebb to a&s;&s;i&s;t us again&s;t the wind; this brought us out of the &s;ight of <HI>England,</HI> and the floud en&s;uing compelled us to our Anchor.</P>
<P>I had now lea&s;ure to &s;ee Gods wonders in the deep; won|ders indeed to us which had never before &s;een them: but too much familiarity had made them no other then the Sailers playfellowes. The waves &s;triving by an imbred ambition which &s;hould be highe&s;t, which formo&s;t. Prece|dencie and &s;upereminencie was equally de&s;ired, and each en|joyed it in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The winde more covetous in ap|pearance, to play with the water, then di&s;turb it, did only rock the billow, and &s;eemed indeed to dandle the Ocean; you would at an other time have thought that the &s;eas had only danced to the winds whi&s;tle; or that the Winde &s;train|ing it &s;elf to a Treble, and the Seas by a Diapa&s;on, &s;upplying the Ba&s;e, had tuned a <HI>Caranto</HI> to our &s;hip. For &s;o orderly they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e and fell according to the time and note of the Billow, that her violent agitation might be imagined to be nothing but a nimble Galliard filled with Capers. This nimblene&s;&s;e of the waves and corre&s;pondency of our Bark unto them, was not to all our company alike plea&s;ing: what in me moved only a reverend and awfull plea&s;ure, was to others an occa&s;ion of &s;ickne&s;&s;e, their heads gidie, their joynts en|feebled, their &s;tomachs loathing &s;u&s;tenance, and with great pangs avoiding what they had taken; in their mouths no|thing might have been &s;o frequent as that of <HI>Horace,</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>NORMANDY</HI> in generall; the Name and bounds of it. The condition of the Antient <HI>Nor|mans,</HI> and of the pre&s;ent. <HI>Ortelius</HI> character of them examined. In what they re&s;emble the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> The commodities of it, and the Government.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe next ebb brought us in &s;ight of the Sea-coa&s;t of <HI>Normandy,</HI> a &s;hore &s;o evenly compa&s;&s;ed and levelled, that it &s;eemeth the work of Art, not Nature; the Rock all the way of an equall height, ri&s;ing from the bottom to the top in a perpendicular, and withall &s;o &s;mooth and poli&s;hed, that if you dare believe it the work of Nature, you mu&s;t al&s;o think, that Nature wrought it by the line, and &s;hewed an art in it above the imitation of an Arti&s;t. This wall is the Northern bound of this Province; the South parts of it being confined with <HI>Le Mainde la Beau&s;&s;e,</HI> and <HI>L' I&s;le de France;</HI> on the Ea&s;t it is divided from <HI>Picardie</HI> by the River of <HI>Some;</HI> and on the North it is bounded with the Ocean, and the little River <HI>Crenon,</HI> which &s;evereth it from a corner
<PB N="5" REF="27">
of <HI>Britain.</HI> It extendeth in length from the beginning of the 19 degree of longitude, to the middle of the 23. <HI>Viz.</HI> from the Cape of St. <HI>Saviour</HI> We&s;t, to the Port-town of St. <HI>Valerie</HI> Ea&s;t. For breadth, it lyeth partly in the 49, part|ly in the 50 degree of Latitude; &s;o that reckoning 60 miles to a degree, we &s;hall finde it to contain 270 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles in length, and 60 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles in breadth, where it is narrowe&s;t.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Antients it was accounted a part of <HI>Gallia Cellica;</HI> the name <HI>Neu&s;tria.</HI> This new title it got by recei|ving into it a new Nation. A people which had &s;o terribly &s;poyled the Maritine Coa&s;ts of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Belgium,</HI> that, <HI>A furore Normannorum,</HI> was in&s;erted into the Letanie. Originally they were of <HI>Norway,</HI> their name importeth it. <HI>Anno</HI> 800, or thereabouts, they began fir&s;t to be accounted one of the Plagues of <HI>Europe:</HI> 900 they &s;eated them&s;elves in <HI>France</HI> by the permi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Balde,</HI> and the valor of <HI>Rollo</HI> their Captain. Before this, they had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though they long held it not, and <HI>anno</HI> 1067 they added to the glory of their name by the conque&s;t of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> You would think them a people not only born to the warres, but to victory. But, <HI>Ut frugum &s;emina mutato &s;olo degenerant, &s;ic illa genuina feritas eorum, amoenitate mollila e&s;t; Florus</HI> &s;pake it of the <HI>Gaules</HI> removed into <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> it is apply|able to the <HI>Norwegians</HI> tran&s;planted into <HI>Gallia:</HI> yet fell they not &s;uddenly, and at once into that want of courage which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth them. During the time they continued <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they attempted the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI> with a fortune an&s;werable to their valour. Being once oppre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> and in &s;laved under that <HI>Monarchie;</HI> they grew pre|&s;ently cre&s;t-faln; and at once lo&s;t both their &s;pirits, and their liberty.</P>

Liberty is the Mother and the Nur&s;e of tho&s;e two qualities; and therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> (not unhappily) expre&s;&s;ed both the conditions of a <HI>Freeman,</HI> and a <HI>di&s;creet and mode&s;t per&s;onage,</HI> by this own word <HI>Ingenuus.</HI> Why the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould lay a greater burden on the backs of this Nation, then their fel|lowes, I cannot determine.

It may be, to abate their naturall pride and &s;tub|bornne&s;&s;e.

<P><HI>JUne</HI> the 30. at 6 of the clock in the morning, we landed at <HI>Dieppe,</HI> one of the Haven-towns of <HI>Normandy;</HI> &s;eated on an arme of the Sea, between two hils, which em|brace it in the nature of a Bay. This &s;ecureth the Haven from the violence of the weather, and is a great &s;trength to the Town again&s;t the attempts of any forces which &s;hould a&s;&s;ault it by Sea. The Town lying within the&s;e mountains, almo&s;t a quarter of a mile up the channell. The Town it &s;elf is not uncomely, the &s;treets large and wel paved, the hou&s;es of an indifferent height, and built upright without any jettings out of one part over the other. The Fortifications, they &s;ay, (for we were not permitted to &s;ee them) are very good and modern; without &s;tone, within earth: on the top of the hill, a Ca&s;tle finely &s;eated, both to defend the Town, and on occa&s;ions to command it. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;teth of 60 men, in pay no more, but when need requireth, the Cap|tain hath authority to arme the Inhabitants. The pre&s;ent Governour is the Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> who al&s;o is the Go|vernour of the province, entru&s;ted with both tho&s;e charges

by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. <HI>anno</HI> 1619. An action in which he &s;warved &s;omewhat from the example of his father; who never com|mitted the military command of a Countrey (which is the office of the Governour) and the cu&s;tody of a Town of war or a Fortre&s;&s;e, unto one man. The Duke of <HI>Biron</HI> might hope as great a curte&s;ie from that King, as the mo&s;t de&s;erving of his Subjects. He had &s;tuck clo&s;e to him in all his adver&s;i|ties, received many an honourable &s;car in his &s;ervice; and indeed, was both <HI>Fabius</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> the Sword and Buckler of the <HI>French</HI> empire. In a word, he might have &s;aid to this <HI>Henry,</HI> what <HI>Silius</HI> in <HI>Tacitus</HI> did to <HI>Tiberius, Suum militem in ob&s;equio man&s;i&s;&s;e, cum alii ad &s;editiones prolaberentur; neque du|raturum Tiberii imperium, &s;i iis quoque legionibus cupido novandi fui&s;&s;et:</HI> yet when he became <HI>petitioner</HI> to the King for the Citadell of <HI>Burg,</HI> &s;eated on the confines of his government of <HI>Bourgogne,</HI> the King denied it. The rea&s;on was, becau&s;e Go|vernours of Provinces which command in chief, <HI>ought not to have the command of Places and Fortre&s;&s;es</HI> within their Govern|ment. There was al&s;o another rea&s;on &amp; more enforcing, which was, that the Petitioner was &s;u&s;pected to hold intelligence with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who&s;e Town it was. The &s;ame <HI>Henry,</HI> though he loved the Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon,</HI> even to the envy of the Court; yet even to him al&s;o he u&s;ed the &s;ame cau|tion. Therefore when he had made him Governor of <HI>Xain|roigne</HI> and <HI>Angoulmois,</HI> he put al&s;o into his hands the Towns of <HI>Metz</HI> and <HI>Boulogne;</HI> places &s;o remote from the &s;eat of his Government, and &s;o di&s;tant one from another, that they did rather di&s;tract his power, then increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>England</HI> have been well, and for a long time ver&s;ed in this maxime of e&s;tate. Let <HI>Kent</HI> be one of our ex|amples, and <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> the other. In <HI>Kent</HI> at this time the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> (or as the <HI>French</HI> would call him, the Governor) is the Earl of <HI>Mountgomerie;</HI> yet is <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Buckhingham;</HI> and that of <HI>Quinborough</HI> in the cu&s;tody of Sir <HI>Edward Hobby:</HI> of which the one commandeth the Sea, and the other the Thames, and the Medway. In <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> is the Earl of <HI>South-Hampton:</HI> but the government of the Town and Garri&s;on of <HI>Porte&s;|mouth,</HI> is entru&s;ted to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke:</HI> neither is

<P>But King <HI>Lewis</HI> now reigning in <HI>France,</HI> minded not his Fathers action; when at the &s;ame time al&s;o he made his con|fident Mr. <HI>Luines</HI> Governor of <HI>Picardie,</HI> and of the Town and Citadell of <HI>Amiens.</HI> The time en&s;uing gave him a &s;ight of this State-breach. For when the Dukes of <HI>E&s;pernon, Vendo&s;me, Longueville, Mayenne</HI> and <HI>Nemours,</HI> the Count of <HI>Soi&s;ons</HI> and others, &s;ided with the Queen Mother again&s;t the King; the Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> &s;trengthned this <HI>Dieppe;</HI> and had not Peace &s;uddenly followed, would have made it good, maugre the Kings forces. A Town it is of great importance, King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. u&s;ing it as his <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> or City of refuge, when the league was hotte&s;t again&s;t him. For, had he been further di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, from hence might he have made an e&s;cape into <HI>England;</HI> and in at this door was the entance made for tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> forces which gave him the fir&s;t &s;tep to his throne. The Town hath been pillaged and taken by our <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, in his war again&s;t <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus;</HI> and in the decli|ning of our affaires in <HI>France,</HI> it was nine monthes together be&s;ieged by the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> but with that &s;ucce&s;&s;e, which commonly attendeth a falling <HI>Empire.</HI> The number of the Inhabitants is about 30000, whereof 9000 and upwards are of the Reformation, and are allowed them for the exerci&s;e of their religion, the Church of <HI>Arques,</HI> a Village &s;ome two miles di&s;tant; the remainders are Papi&s;ts. In this Town I met with the fir&s;t <HI>Idolatry,</HI> which ever I yet &s;aw, more then in my Books. <HI>Quos antea audiebam, hodie vidi Deos,</HI> as a barbarous <HI>German</HI> in <HI>Vellejus</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> The Gods of <HI>Rome,</HI> which before I only heard of, I now &s;aw, and might have wor&s;hipped.

Before it went a Bell continually tinkling, at the &s;ound whereof all &s;uch as are in their hou&s;es, being war|ned that then their God goeth by them, make &s;ome &s;hew of reverence; tho&s;e which meet it in the &s;treet, with bended

knees and elevated hands doing it honour. The <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> of this Bell make an u&s;e more religious, and u&s;e it as a war|ning or watch-peal to avoid that &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eet through which they hear it coming. This invention of the Bell hath &s;omewhat in it of <HI>Turei&s;me,</HI> it being the cu&s;tome there at their <HI>Ca|nonicall</HI> houres, when they hear the criers bawling in the &s;teeples, to fall pro&s;trate on the ground where&s;oever they are and ki&s;&s;e it thrice, &s;o doing their devotions to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The carrying of it about the &s;treets hath, no que&s;tion, in it a touch of the <HI>Jew,</HI> this ceremony being borrowed from that of carrying about the Arke on the &s;houlders of the <HI>Levites.</HI> The other main part of it which is the <HI>Adoration,</HI> is derived from the <HI>Heathens,</HI> there never being a people but they, which afforded divine honors to things in animate. But the people indeed, I cannot blame for this Idolatrous devotion, their con&s;ciences being per&s;waded, that what they &s;ee pa&s;&s;e by them, is the very body of their Saviour. For my part, could the like belief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e my under&s;tanding, I could meet it with greater reverence, then their Church can en|joyn me. The Prie&s;ts and Doctors of the people are to be condemned only, who impo&s;e and inforce this &s;in upon their hearers. And doubtle&s;&s;e there is a reward which at|tendeth them for it. Of &s;tanding it is &s;o young, that I never met with it before the year 1215. Then did Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> ordain in a Councell holden at <HI>Rome,</HI> that there &s;hould be a <HI>Pix</HI> made to cover the Bread, and a Bell bought to be rung before it. The Adoration of it was enjoyned by Pope <HI>Honorius, anno</HI> 1226. both afterward encrea&s;ed by the new &s;olemn fea&s;t of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> day, by Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the IV. <HI>anno</HI> 1264. and confirmed for ever with multitudes of pardons, in the Councell of <HI>Vienna,</HI> by <HI>Clement</HI> the V. <HI>anno</HI> 1310.

But this was not our greate&s;t mi&s;ery. The rain fell in us through our tilt, which for the many holes in it, one would have thought to have been a net.

<P>Let us now walke into the <HI>Kitching,</HI> and ob&s;erve their provi&s;ion.

The women not of <HI>Nor|mandy</HI> alone, but generally of all <HI>France,</HI> are forced to be contented with a little beauty; and &s;he which with us is reckoned with the vulgar, would among&s;t them be taken for a Prince&s;&s;e. But of the <HI>French</HI> women, more when we have taken a view of the Dames of <HI>Paris;</HI> now only &s;ome|what of their habit and condition. Their habit in which they differ from the re&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> is the attire of the head, which hangeth down their backs in the fa&s;hion of a Vail. In <HI>Roven</HI> and the greater Cities, it is made of linen, pure and decent; here, and in the Villages, it cannot po&s;&s;ible be any thing el&s;e then an old di&s;h-clout turned out of &s;ervice, or the corner of a tablecloth re&s;erved from wa&s;hing. Their be&s;t conditi|on is not alwayes vi&s;ible. They &s;hew it only in the mor|nings, or when you are ready to depart, and that is their beg|ging; you &s;hall have about you &s;uch a throng of tho&s;e ill|faces, and every one whining out this <HI>dity, Pour les &s;ervants,</HI> that one might with greater ea&s;e di&s;tribute a dole at a rich mans Funerall, then give them a penny.

<P>But the principall ornaments of the&s;e Innes, are the men|&s;ervants, the raggede&s;t regiment that ever I yet looked upon. Such a thing as a <HI>Chamberlaine</HI> was never heard of among&s;t them, and good clothes are as little known as he. By the habit of his attendants, a man would think him&s;elf in a Gaol; their clothes either full of patches, or open to the skin.

It is enough for him, that he hath written the coppy. They wait al|wayes with their hats on their heads, and &s;o al&s;o do &s;ervants before their ma&s;ters: attending bare-headed, is as much out

of fa&s;hion there, as in <HI>Turkey:</HI> of all <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions, in my opinion, the mo&s;t unfitting and un&s;eeming. Time and much u&s;e reconciled me to many other things, which at the fir&s;t were offen&s;ive; to this unreverent cu&s;tome, I returned an enemy. Neither can I &s;ee how it can choo&s;e but &s;tomach the mo&s;t patient, to &s;ee the worthye&s;t &s;igne of liberty u&s;urped and profaned by the ba&s;e&s;t of &s;laves. For &s;eeing that the <HI>French pai&s;antrie,</HI> are &s;uch infinite &s;laves unto their Lords and Princes, it cannot be, but that tho&s;e which are their &s;ervants, mu&s;t be one degree at the lea&s;t, below the lowe&s;t condition.</P>
<P>Certainly among the antients, this <HI>promi&s;euous covering</HI> of the head, was never heard of. It was with them the chief &s;ign of freedome, as is well known to tho&s;e which are con|ver&s;ant with Antiquity. The <HI>Lacones</HI> a people of <HI>Pelopon|ne&s;us,</HI> after they had obtained to be made free denizens of <HI>Lacedemon,</HI> in &s;igne of their new-gotten liberty, would never go into the battail <HI>ni&s;i pileati,</HI> but with their hats on. A|mong&s;t the <HI>Africans,</HI> as it is written in <HI>Alexander ab Alexan|dro,</HI> the placing of a hat on the top of a &s;pear, was u&s;ed as a token to incite the people to their liberty, which had been oppre&s;&s;ed by Tyrants; <HI>Per pileum in ha&s;ta propo&s;itum, ad liberta|tem proclamari.</HI> But among&s;t the <HI>Romans,</HI> we have more va|riety. The taking off of the hat of <HI>Tarquinius Pri&s;cus</HI> by an Eagle, and the putting of it on again, occa&s;ioned the <HI>Augur</HI> to prophe&s;ic unto him the Kingdom, which fell out accor|dingly. In their &s;word playes, when one of the Gladiators had with credit &s;lain his adver&s;ary; they would &s;ometimes honour him with a Palm, &s;ometimes with the Hat. Of the&s;e the la&s;t was the worthyer, the Palm only honouring the Victor, this al&s;o enfranchizing the receivers; therefore con|ferred commonly on him which had killed mo&s;t men in the Theatres. Hence the complaints of <HI>Tertullian, lib. de Spectacu|lis, cap. 21.

In the Univer&s;ities of <HI>Eng|land</HI> this cu&s;tome is &s;till in force; the putting on of the cap being never performed, but in the &s;olemn <HI>Comitia,</HI> and in the pre&s;ence of all &s;uch as are either auditors or &s;pectators of that dayes exerci&s;e.

<P><HI>JUly</HI> the fir&s;t we &s;et on for <HI>Roven.</HI> In 10 hours our Cart dragged us thither, the whole journey being in all &s;ix leagues <HI>French:</HI> admirable &s;peed! About three of the clock in the afternoon we had a &s;ight of the Town, daintily &s;eated in a valley on the River <HI>Seine.</HI> I know not any Town better &s;ituate, <HI>Oxford</HI> excepted, which indeed it much re&s;embleth; I mean not in bigne&s;&s;e, but &s;ituation: It &s;tand|eth on all &s;ides evironed with mountains, the North ex|cepted, and hath a large and plea&s;ant walk of meadowes by the river &s;ide, to the South-ea&s;t-ward; as <HI>Oxford</HI> hath towards <HI>Eveley.</HI> It is &s;eated on the principall river of <HI>France,</HI> di&s;tant from the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Country 50 miles <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or thereabouts; as <HI>Oxford</HI> on the <HI>Thames,</HI> and from <HI>Lon|don.</HI> Watered al&s;o it is with two &s;mall rivulets, <HI>Robee</HI> and <HI>Renelle,</HI> as the other with <HI>Charwell</HI> and <HI>Eventode.</HI> The diffe|rence is, that <HI>Oxford</HI> is &s;eated &s;omewhat higher on the &s;welling of an hill, and a little more removed from tho&s;e mountains which environ it: and that the rivers which run through &s;ome part of <HI>Roven,</HI> do only wa&s;h the precincts of the other. The buildings are in &s;ome places wood, in &s;ome &s;tone, in other both; the hou&s;es without juttings or
<PB N="20" REF="35">
overlets, four &s;tories high, and in the front not very beau|tifull. The mo&s;t promi&s;ing hou&s;e which mine eye met with, was that of Mr. <HI>Boniface,</HI> who being of ob&s;cure parents, and having rai&s;ed him&s;elf a fortune in the wars, again&s;t the <HI>League,</HI> here built a receptacle for his age. It is fa&s;hioned after the man|ner of new buildings in <HI>London,</HI> compo&s;ed all of dainty white &s;tone, &s;quare and poli&s;hed. On the partition between the fir&s;t &s;tory and the &s;econd, it hath the&s;e words engraven, <HI>Vi &amp; Virtute. Martis opus. Tentanda via. Amore &amp; armis: a motto</HI> &s;utable to his ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>The other buildings of note are the bridge (for I as yet omit the Hou&s;e of Parliament and the Churches) and the Town wall by it. The bridge, whil&s;t it was all &s;tanding, was thought to have been the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t piece of that kinde in all <HI>France.</HI> It con&s;i&s;teth of twelve arches, large and high: there now remain but &s;even of them, the re&s;t being broken down by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the falling of their affairs in <HI>France,</HI> the better to make good the Town again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI> The river is here about the breadth of the <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">nes</HI> at <HI>Fulham.</HI> Between the River and the Town wall, is the Exchange or meeting place of the Merchants, paved with broad and even peble. In breadth up to the wall-ward 30 yards, in length 100; a fine walke in fair weather. All along the banke &s;ide lay the &s;hips, which by rea&s;on of the broken bridge come up thither, and on occa&s;ions higher: a good turn for <HI>Paris.</HI> The wall for the length of 100 yards, is as &s;traight as one may lay a line, of a ju&s;t height, and compo&s;ed of &s;quare and excellent &s;tones, &s;o cunningly laid, that I never &s;aw the &s;ides of a Noble mans hou&s;e built more hand&s;omely. But it is not only the beauty of the wall which <HI>Roven</HI> delighteth in, there mu&s;t &s;omewhat al&s;o be expe|cted of &s;trength: to which purpo&s;e it might &s;erve indiffe|rently well, were there &s;ome addition of earth within it. It is well helped on the out&s;ide by the breadth and depth of the ditches; but more by St. <HI>Katherines</HI> fort &s;eated on a hill at the Ea&s;t &s;ide of it. A Fort, which were it &s;trengthned according to the modern art of fortifying, would much a&s;&s;ure the Town, and make it at once, both a &s;lave and a comman|der. The <HI>Mar&s;hall D' Ancre,</HI> when he was <HI>Lieutenant</HI> here
<PB N="21" REF="35">
for the Queen mother, began to fortifie this mountain, <HI>Quilleboeu&s;e,</HI> and other places of importance; but upon his death they were all ra&s;ed: what were his projects in it, they know be&s;t which were acquainted with his ambiti|on. Certainly the jars which he had &s;owen among&s;t the Princes one with the other, and between them and the King: &s;hew that they were not intended for no|thing.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Roven</HI> 32 Pari&s;h Churches, be&s;ides tho&s;e which belong to Abbies and Religious hou&s;es, of which the mo&s;t beautifull is that of St. <HI>Audoin</HI> or <HI>Owen,</HI> once Archbi&s;hop of this City. The &s;eat and Church of the Archbi&s;hop is that of <HI>No&s;tre dame,</HI> a building far more gorgeous in the out&s;ide, then within. It pre&s;ents it &s;elf to you with a very gracious and maje&s;ticall front, decked with mo&s;t curious imagery, and adorned with three &s;tately Towers. The fir&s;t <HI>La tour de beurre</HI> (becau&s;e it was built with that money which was rai&s;ed by Cardinall Dr. <HI>Amboy&s;e,</HI> for granting a di&s;pen&s;a|tion to eat butter in the Lent): and a third built over the porch or great door, wherein is the great Bell &s;o much talked of. Within it is but plain and ordinary, &s;uch as common Cathedrall Churches u&s;ually are, &s;o big, &s;o fa&s;hioned. Behinde the high Altar, at a pillar on the left had, is the remainder of the Duke of <HI>Bedfords</HI> Tomb: which for ought I could di&s;cerne, was nothing but an <HI>Epitaph</HI> &s;ome three yards high in the pillar. I &s;aw nothing in it, which might move the envie of any Courtier to have it defaced, un|le&s;&s;e it were the title of <HI>Regent du Royaume de France,</HI> which is the lea&s;t he merited.</P>
<P>Somewhat Ea&s;tward, beyond this is our Ladies Chappell, a prety neat piece, and daintily &s;et out. There &s;tandeth on the top of the &s;creen, the image of the Virgin her &s;elf, between two Angels. They have attired her in a red mantle, laced with two gold laces, a hand&s;ome ruffe about her neck, a vail of fine lawne hanging down her back, and (to &s;hew that &s;he was the Queen of heaven) a crown upon her head: in her left arme &s;he holds her &s;on in his &s;ide-coat, a black hat and a golden hatband. A jolly plump Ladie &s;he &s;eemeth to be, of a flaxen hair, a ruddy lip, and a chearefull complexion.
<PB N="22" REF="36">
Twere well the Painters would agree about limming of her, otherwi&s;e we are likely to have almo&s;t as many Ladies, as Churches. At <HI>No&s;tre dame</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;he is taught us to be browne, and &s;eemeth &s;omewhat inclining to melancholie. I &s;peak not of her different habit, for I envie not her changes of apparell Only I could not but ob&s;erve how tho&s;e of St. <HI>Se|pulchres</HI> Church, <HI>en la Fue</HI> St. <HI>Dennis,</HI> have placed her on the top of their Skreen, in a Coape, as if &s;he had taken upon her the zeal of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and were going to make a bloudy &s;acrifice of her Son. They of <HI>No&s;tre dame</HI> in <HI>Amiens,</HI> have erected her <HI>Statua</HI> all in gold, with her Son al&s;o of the &s;ame mettle in her armes; ca&s;ting beams of gold round about her, as the Sun is painted in its full glory: &s;trange Idolatries! On the contrary, in the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Tury,</HI> in <HI>La Beau&s;&s;e,</HI> &s;he is to be &s;een in a plain petticoat of red, and her other garments corre&s;pondent. In my minde this holdeth mo&s;t proportion to her e&s;tate, and will be&s;t &s;erve to free their irre|ligion from ab&s;urdity. If they will wor&s;hip her as a nur&s;e, with her childe in her arme, or at her bre&s;t, let them array her in &s;uch apparell, as might be&s;eem a Carpenters wife; &s;uch as &s;he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have worn before the world had taken notice, that &s;he was the mother of her Saviour. If they needs mu&s;t have her in her e&s;tate of glory, as at <HI>Amiens;</HI> or of honour (being now publickly acknowledged to be the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed|e&s;t among women)</HI> as at <HI>Paris,</HI> let them disburden her of her child. To clap them thus together, is a folly, equally worthy of &s;corne and laughter. Certainly had &s;he but &s;o much liber|ty, as to make choice of her own clothes, I doubt not but &s;he would ob&s;erve a greater <HI>decorum.</HI> And therefore I com|mend the <HI>Capuchins</HI> of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> who in a little &s;ide-chappell con&s;ecrated unto her, have placed only a hand&s;ome fair looking-gla&s;&s;e upon her Altar, the be&s;t ornament of a female clo&s;et: why they placed it there, I cannot &s;ay, only I conceive it was, that &s;he might there &s;ee how to dre&s;&s;e her &s;elf.</P>

<P>We &s;aid even now, that from the &s;entence of this Court there lay no appeal; but this mu&s;t be recanted, and it is no &s;hame to do it: St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> hath written his <HI>Retractations;</HI> &s;o al&s;o hath <HI>Bellarmine.</HI> Once in the year there is an appeal ad|mitted, but that for one man only, and on this occa&s;ion: There was a poy&s;onous Dragon not far from <HI>Roven,</HI> which had done much harme to the Countrey and City. Many wayes had been tryed to de&s;troy him, but none pro&s;pered; at la&s;t <HI>Romain,</HI> afterwards made a Saint, then Archbi&s;hop of the Town, accompanied with a theef and a murderer, who&s;e lives had been forfeited to a &s;entence, undertaketh the enter|pri&s;e; upon &s;ight of the Dragon the theef &s;tole away, the murderer goeth on, and &s;eeth that holy man vanqui&s;h the Serpent, armed only with a Stole (it is a neck habit, &s;an|ctifyed by his Holine&s;&s;e of <HI>Rome,</HI> and made much after the manner of a tippet) with this Stole tied about the neck of the Dragon, doth the murderer lead him pri&s;oner to <HI>Roven.</HI> To make &s;hort work, the name of God is prai&s;ed, the Bi&s;hop magnifyed, the murderer pardoned, and the Dragon bur|ned. This accident (if the &s;tory be not <HI>Apocrypha)</HI> is &s;aid to have hapned on <HI>holy Thur&s;day. Audoin</HI> or <HI>Owen,</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;or unto St. <HI>Romain,</HI> in memory of this marvellous act, obtai|ned of King <HI>Dagobert</HI> the fir&s;t (he began his reign <HI>anno</HI> 632) that from that time forwards the <HI>Chapitre</HI> of the Ca|thedrall Church, &s;hould every <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> day have the faculty of delivering any malefactor, whom the lawes had condem|ned. This that King then granted, and all the following Kings even to this time have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively confirmed it. I omit the ceremonies and &s;olemnities wherewith this pri&s;oner is

taken from his irons, and re&s;tored to liberty. It is not above nine years agone, &s;ince a <HI>Baron</HI> of <HI>Ga&s;coyne</HI> took occa&s;ion to kill his wife, which done, he fled hither into <HI>Normandy;</HI> and ha|ving fir&s;t acquainted the <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>No&s;tre dame</HI> with his de&s;ire, put him&s;elf to the &s;entence of the Court, and was adjudged to the wheel. <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-day</HI> immediately coming on, the <HI>Canons</HI> challenged him, and the Judge, according to the cu|&s;tome, cau&s;ed him to be delivered. But the <HI>Normans</HI> pleaded that the benefit of that priviledge belonged only to the natives of that Province; and they pleaded with &s;uch &s;ury, that the Baron was again committed to pri&s;on, till the Queen Mo|ther had wooed the people, <HI>pro ea &s;altem vice,</HI> to admit of his reprievall.</P>
<P>I deferred to &s;peak of the language of <HI>Normandy,</HI> till I came hither, becau&s;e here it is be&s;t &s;poken.

<P><HI>JUly</HI> the &s;econd we take our farewell of <HI>Roven,</HI> better ac|commodated then we came thither; yet not &s;o well at I de&s;ired. We are now preferred <HI>ab A&s;inis ad equos,</HI> from the Cart to the Waggon. The <HI>French</HI> call it a Coach, but that matters not; &s;o they would needs have the Cart to be a Chariot. The&s;e Waggons are the ordinary in&s;truments of travell in tho&s;e Countries; much of a kin to <HI>Grave&s;end</HI>'s barge. You &s;hall hardly finde them without a knave or a Giglot. A man may be &s;ure to be merry in them, were he as certain to be whole&s;ome. This, in which we travelled, contained ten per&s;ons, as all of them commonly do; and among&s;t the&s;e ten, one might have found <HI>Engli&s;h, Scots, French, Normans, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> a jolly medley; had our religi|ons been as different as our Nations, I &s;hould have thought my &s;elf in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> or <HI>Poland;</HI> if a man had de&s;ired to have &s;een a Brief or an Epitome of the World, he would no where have received &s;uch &s;atisfaction, as by looking on us. I have already reckoned up the &s;everal Nations, I will now lay open the &s;everall conditions. There were then to be found among&s;t the&s;e ten pa&s;&s;engers, men and women, Lords and &s;erving men, Scholars and Clowns, Ladies and Chambermaids, Prie&s;ts and Laie-men, Gentlemen and Artificers, people of all &s;exes and almo&s;t all ages. <HI>If all the learning in the world were lo&s;t, it might be found again in Plutarch,</HI> &s;o &s;aid <HI>Budaeus.</HI> If all the Nations in the world had been lo&s;t, they might have been found again in our Waggon, &s;o I. Seriou&s;ly I think our

Coach to have been no unfit repre&s;entation of the Ark. A whole world of men and languages might have grown out of it.</P>
<P>But all this while our Waggon joggeth on, but &s;o lei&s;ure|ly, that it gave me leave to take a more patient view of the Countrey, then we could in the Cart. And here, indeed, I &s;aw &s;ufficient to affect the Countrey, yea to dote on it, had I not come out of <HI>England.</HI> The fields &s;uch as already I have de&s;cribed, every where be&s;et with Apple-trees, and fruits of the like nature. You could &s;carce &s;ee any thing which was barren in the whole Journey. The&s;e Apples are both meat and drink to the poor <HI>Pai&s;ant.</HI> For the Coun|try is ill provided with Vines (the only want I could ob&s;erve in it) and Beer is a good beverage at a Gentlemans table, Sider then, or Perry are the poor mans Claret; and happy man is he, which once or twice a week can a&s;pire &s;o high a|bove water. To proceed, through many a mi&s;erable Vil|lage <HI>(Burghs</HI> they call them) and one Town &s;omewhat big|ger then the re&s;t, called <HI>Equille;</HI> we came that night to St. <HI>Claire 10 French</HI> miles from <HI>Roven,</HI> a poor Town god wot, and had nothing in it remarkable, but an accident. There dwelt a monk there, grown into great opinion for his &s;anctity, and one who had an e&s;peciall hand upon &s;ore eyes; yet his ability herein was not generall, none being capable of cure from him but pure Virgins. I per&s;wade my &s;elf <HI>France</HI> could not yield him many patients: and yet from all parts he was much &s;ought unto. Hope of cure and a charita|ble opinion, which they had of them&s;elves, had brought to him divers di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Damo&s;els; which, I am confident, had no intere&s;t in his miracle. In the &s;ame Inne (Alehou&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay) where we were to be harbored, there had put in a whole convoy of the&s;e <HI>Ladies errant, Pilgrims</HI> they called them&s;elves, and had come on foot two dayes journey to cleer their eye-&s;ight. They had white vailes hanging down their backs, which in part covered their faces; yet I percei|ved by a glimp&s;e, that &s;ome of them were pa&s;t cure. Though my charity dur&s;t allow them maids, it was afraid to &s;up|po&s;e them Virgins: yet &s;o far I dare a&s;&s;ure them they &s;hould recover their &s;ight, that when they came home, they &s;hould

At that time, what with too much watching on &s;hipboard, what with the tartne&s;&s;e of the water, and the violence of the winde, working upon me for almo&s;t 40 houres together whil&s;t I lay on the Hatches: mine eyes had gotten a rheum and a redne&s;&s;e: my Ho&s;te&s;s (good woman) per&s;waded me to this holy Eye-wright, but I dur&s;t not ven|ture Not that I had not as good a title to my Virginity as the be&s;t there: but becau&s;e I had learned what a grievous &s;entence was denounced on <HI>Ahaziah</HI> king of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> for &s;eeking help of <HI>Belzebub</HI> the god of <HI>Eckron.</HI> When I hap to be ill, let my amendment come on Gods name. <HI>Mallem &s;emper profanus e&s;&s;e, quam &s;ic religio&s;us,</HI> as <HI>Minutius Foelix</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sacrifices.

<P>The next morning <HI>(July</HI> 3) I left my pilgrims to try their fortunes, and went on in our journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> which that day we were to vi&s;ite.

I had lea&s;ure enough to provide him a longer Epitaph, and a &s;horter apologie again&s;t the envie of that Courtier, which per&s;waded <HI>Charles</HI> the VIII to deface the ruines of his Sepulchre: Thus.</P>

<P>I Am come to the <HI>French</HI> Women, and it were great pity they &s;hould not immediately follow the di&s;cour&s;e of the men, &s;o like they are one to the other, that one would think them to be the &s;ame, and that all the difference lay in the apparell. For per&s;on, they are generally of an indifferent &s;tature, their bodies &s;traight, and their wa&s;tes commonly &s;mall: but whether it be &s;o by nature, or by much re&s;training of the&s;e parts, I cannot &s;ay. It is &s;aid, that an ab&s;olute woman &s;hould have (among&s;t other qualities re|qui&s;ite) the parts of a <HI>French</HI> woman from the neck to the girdle; but I believe it holdeth not good, their &s;houlders and backs being &s;o broad, that they hold no proportion with their midles; yet this may be the vice of their apparell.

This I am &s;ure of, that &s;carce the tithe of all the maids we &s;aw, had her hands and arme wri&s;ts free from &s;cabs, which had over-run them like a lepro&s;ie.

<P>Yet was that blackne&s;&s;e but a darker brown; and not &s;o f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">full as this of the <HI>French</HI> women. Again, the blackne&s;&s;e of the hair is then accounted for an ornament, when the face about which it hangeth, is of &s;o perfect a complexion and <HI>&s;ymmetrie,</HI> that it giveth it a lu&s;tre. Then doth the hair &s;et forth the face, as a &s;hadow doth a picture; and the face be|cometh the haire, as a <HI>field-argent</HI> doth a <HI>&s;able-bearing,</HI> which kind of Armory the <HI>Heralds</HI> call the mo&s;t faire&s;t.

<P>I Have now done with the <HI>French,</HI> both men and women: a people much extolled by many of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Travellers, for all tho&s;e graces which may enoble &amp; adorn both &s;exes. For my part, having ob&s;erved them as well as I could,
<PB N="51" REF="50">
and traced them in all their &s;everal humors: I &s;et up my re&s;t with this propo&s;ition, that <HI>there is nothing in them to be envied but their Countrey.</HI> To that indeed I am earne&s;tly, and I think not unworthily affected: here being nothing want|ing which may be required, to rai&s;e and reward ones liking. If nature was ever prodigal of her ble&s;&s;ings, or &s;cattered them with an over-plentiful hand; it was in this I&s;land: into which we were entred, as &s;oon as we pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge of <HI>Pontoy&s;e.</HI> The fir&s;t part of it, which la&s;ted for three leagues; was upon the plain of a mountain: but &s;uch a mountain, as will hardly yeeld to the be&s;t valley in <HI>Europe,</HI> out of <HI>France.</HI> On both &s;ides of us the Vines grew up in a ju&s;t length, and promi&s;ed to the husbandman a thriving vintage. The Wines they yeeld are far better then tho&s;e of <HI>Normandy,</HI> or <HI>Ga&s;coyne;</HI> and indeed the be&s;t in the whole Continent, tho&s;e of <HI>Orleans</HI> excepted: yet what we &s;aw here, was but as a bit to prepare our &s;tomachs; le&s;t we &s;hould &s;urfeit in the valley.</P>
<P>Here we beheld nature in her riche&s;t ve&s;timents. The fields &s;o interchangeably planted with Wheat and Vines, that had <HI>L. Florus</HI> once beheld it, he would never have gi|ven unto <HI>Campania</HI> the title of <HI>Cereris &amp; Bacchi certamen.</HI> The&s;e fields were di&s;per&s;edly here and there, be&s;et with Cherry trees; which con&s;idered with the re&s;t, gave unto the eye an excellent object. For the Vines yet green; the Wheat ready for the &s;ithe; and the cherries now fully ripened, and &s;hewing forth their beauties through the vails of the leaves: made &s;uch a various and delight&s;ome mixture of colours, that no art could have expre&s;&s;ed it &s;elf more delectably. If you have ever &s;een an exqui&s;ite Mo&s;aical work, you may the be&s;t judge of the beauty of this valley. Add to this, that the River <HI>Seine</HI> being now pa&s;t <HI>Paris;</HI> either to embrace that flouri&s;hing &s;oyle, or out of a wanton de&s;ire to play with it &s;elf, hath divided it &s;elf into &s;undry le&s;&s;er channels; be|&s;ides its &s;everal windings and turnings: &s;o that one may very ju&s;tly, and not irreligiou&s;ly, conceive it to be an Idea, or repre&s;entation of the Garden of <HI>Eden:</HI> the river &s;o hap|pily &s;eparating it &s;elf, to water the ground.

<P>The mo&s;teminent place in all this I&s;le is <HI>Mont-martre,</HI> emi|nent I mean by rea&s;on of its height; though it hath al&s;o enough of antiquity to make it remarkable. It is &s;eated within a mile of <HI>Paris,</HI> high upon a mountain: on which many of the faithfull, during the time that <HI>Gaule</HI> was hea|theni&s;h, were made Martyrs. Hence the name. Though <HI>Paris</HI> was the place of apprehen&s;ion and &s;entence, yet was this Mountain commonly the &s;caffold of execution: it being the cu&s;tome of the ancients, neither to put to death, nor to bury within the wals of their Cities. Thus the <HI>Jewes</HI> when they cruci&s;ied our Saviour, led him out of the City of <HI>Hieru&s;alem</HI> unto Mount <HI>Calvarie:</HI> unto which St. <HI>Paul</HI> is thought to allude, Heb. 13. &s;aying, <HI>Let us. therefore go forth

As they permit|ted not executions of malefactors within their wals: &s;o neither would they &s;uffer the be&s;t of their Citizens to be buried within them. This was it which made <HI>Abraham</HI> to buy him a field wherein to bury his dead: and thus we read in the 7. of <HI>Luke,</HI> that the widow of <HI>Naims</HI> &s;on was <HI>carried out to be buried.</HI> This cu&s;tome al&s;o we find among&s;t the <HI>Athenians, Corinthians,</HI> and other of the <HI>Grecians, Qui in agris &s;uis</HI> (as &s;aith <HI>Alexander ab Alexandro) aut in fundo &s;ubur|bano, &s;eu in avito &amp; patrio &s;olo corpora humari con&s;uevere.</HI> Among&s;t the <HI>Romans,</HI> it was the fa&s;hion to burn the bodies of the dead, within their City. This continued till the bringing in of the Lawes of <HI>Athens,</HI> commonly called the Lawes of the 12. Tables: one of which Lawes runneth in the&s;e words, <HI>In urbe ne &s;epelito, neve urito.</HI> After this prohibition, their dead corps were fir&s;t burned in <HI>Campus Martius;</HI> and their urnes covered in &s;undry places in the fields. The fre|quent urnes or &s;epulchral &s;tones, digged up among&s;t us here in <HI>England,</HI> are &s;ufficient te&s;timonies of this a&s;&s;ertion.

The fir&s;t that is regi&s;tred to have been buried in the City, was <HI>Trajan</HI> the Emperour. Afterwards it was granted as an honourary to &s;uch as had de&s;erved well of the republick: and when the Chri&s;tian Religion prevailed, and Church-yards, tho&s;e dormitories of Saints were con&s;ecrated; the liberty of burying within the wals, was to all equally granted.</P>

On this ground it not being lawful to put to death or bury, within the Town of <HI>Paris;</HI> this Mountain was de|&s;tinate to tho&s;e purpo&s;es.

Of St. <HI>Denis</HI> being the patron or tutelary Saint of <HI>France,</HI> the Legend reports &s;trange wonders. As namely, when the Exe|cutioner had &s;mitten off his head, that he caught it between his armes; and ran with it down the hill as fa&s;t as his legs could carry him; half a mile from the place of his execution, he &s;ate down and re&s;ted: and &s;o he did nine times in all, even till he came to the place where his Church is now built. There he fell down and died, being three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles from <HI>Mont-martre:</HI> and there he was buried together with <HI>Ru&s;tious,</HI> and <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> who not being able to go as fa&s;t as he did, were brought after him by the people. <HI>O im|pudentiam admirabilem &amp; vere Romanam!</HI> and yet &s;o far was the &s;ucceeding age po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a belief of this miracle, that in the nine &s;everal places where he is &s;aid to have re&s;ted there are erected &s;o many han&s;ome Cro&s;&s;es of &s;tone; all of a making.</P>
<P>To the memory of this Saint, did <HI>Dagobert</HI> the fir&s;t build a Temple: and the times en&s;uing improved it to a Town. Afterwards in honour of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> and becau&s;e it lay neer <HI>Paris;</HI> &s;ome of the following Kings be&s;towed a wall upon it. A wall it is of a large circuit, and very much unpropor|tionable to the Town, which &s;tandeth in it, for all the world like a <HI>Spaniards</HI> little face in his great ruffe, or like a &s;mall chop of Mutton in a large di&s;h of pottage at the three penny Ordinary. Thus was the Town built (as you &s;ee) by natural means: but it was not &s;o with the Temple.

Thus, then &s;aith the &s;tory. <HI>Diagobert</HI> afterwards King of <HI>France,</HI> during the life of <HI>Clotoyre</HI> the &s;econd his Father, had cruelly &s;lain <HI>Sadra&s;egille</HI> his governour. To avoid the fury of his Father, much incen&s;ed with that unprincely action; he was compelled to wander up and down <HI>France</HI> hungry and thir&s;ty. And &s;o he went, and he went, (for this tale &s;hould be told in the &s;ame &s;tile, that wenches tell theirs by the fire &s;ide) till he came to the Sepulchre of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> where he laid down and &s;lept: and then there appeared unto him a fine old man, with a &s;taffe in his hand, and he told him that his father was dead, and that he &s;hould be King, and he prayed him of all loves, that when he came to be King, he would build a Church there, in the honour of St. <HI>Denis.</HI> He had an hard heart, that could deny &s;o &s;weet an old man &s;o little a courte&s;ie, for &s;o much good newes, and I trow the King was more kinde then &s;o. And &s;o when the Church was built, the Bi&s;hop was &s;ent for in all ha&s;te to ble&s;&s;e it. But it chanced that the night before the day where|in the Bi&s;hop was to ble&s;&s;e it, there came to the Town an ugly Leper, and the foule&s;t that ever was &s;een: and this Leper would needs lie in the Church. And when he was there, about twelve a clock at night, our Saviour came in|to the Church in garments as white as the driven &s;now, and there came with him the Apo&s;tles, and the Angels and the Martyrs, and the &s;weete&s;t Mu&s;ick that ever was heard in the world. And then Chri&s;t ble&s;&s;ed the Church, and &s;aid unto the Leper, that he &s;hould tell the Bi&s;hop that the Church was already ble&s;&s;ed, and for a token of it, he gave the Leper his health, who pre&s;ently became as fine a &s;weet youth as one &s;hould &s;ee in a &s;ummers day. <HI>Auditum admi&s;&s;i ri&s;um teneatis?</HI> you may laugh if you plea&s;e, but I'le a&s;&s;ure you this is the &s;tory: neither is it a jot the le&s;&s;e authen|tick becau&s;e of the &s;tile.

<P>But (to omit the additions of the Legend) true it is, that <HI>Dagobert</HI> the fir&s;t, was the founder of the Church: which was after rebuilt and beautified by the 25. Abbot of it, called <HI>Sugger,</HI> in the reign of King <HI>Lewis</HI> the &s;ixth. A reverend and comely fabrick, certainly it is; dark, as the Churches of tho&s;e times commonly were: and none of the poore&s;t. It maintaineth 262 Monks and an Abbot, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ngle reve|nue is thought to be worth 10000 Crowns and upwards. The pre&s;ent Abbot is <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Lorrein,</HI> &s;on to the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> a young Gentleman of &s;ome 14 years of age, or there|abouts: but of him more hereafter. The Abbot of it, among many other priviledges, hath a full power upon the lives, goods, and honours of his va&s;&s;als: and hath a voice in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> as full and binding as any of the Coun&s;ellors there &s;itting. As for the Church it &s;elf, it is in height 80 foot, 100 in breadth; and in length 300. The high Altar, under which the bodies of St. <HI>Denis</HI> and his two fellow-Martyrs, are &s;aid to be buried; is a very rich and excellent work: the Crucifix which &s;tandeth over it, being all of pure gold, encha&s;ed with divers Pearls and precious Stones of great value. Before it hangeth a &s;ilver Lamp con|tinually burning: and if you look about it, you &s;hall &s;ee the riche&s;t and the faire&s;t gla&s;&s;e for painting, in all <HI>France;</HI> that of <HI>Amiens</HI> only excepted. One thing further I will note in this Church, before I come to to the Tombes and reliques; which is, how <HI>Henry</HI> 4. in this Church &s;aid his fir&s;t Ma&s;&s;e, after his la&s;t reconcilement to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> And good rea&s;on I have to &s;ay his la&s;t.

In this vein he continued till the year 1595. and then once more re-embo&s;om'd him&s;elf into the <HI>Roman</HI> Synagogue; which was the time we now &s;peak of. <HI>Quo teneam nodo mutantem Protea vultum?</HI> The only <HI>Proteus</HI> in matters of faith in our times.

As &s;oon as he was &s;adled for his journey, he putteth him&s;elf into his way; and followed it with a pace &s;o nimble, that there was no keeping of him company: his tongue ran &s;o fa&s;t, that the quicke&s;t eye there, was fain to give him over in plain ground: the fellow that &s;heweth the Tombs at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> being no more to be compared to him, for the volubility of his chops, then a Capuchin to a Je&s;uite: yet as we learned afterwards of him (when he was out of his road) they were thus di&s;po&s;ed.

The principall was the maje&s;ty of the hou&s;e, which is, indeed, worth the ob&s;ervation. The Palace of the <HI>Loure</HI> &s;o much famed, is not to be named in the &s;ame day with it. The rooms are well ordered, and high roofed, gorgeou&s;ly &s;et out with the curio&s;ities of the Painter. In &s;ome of the Chambers they &s;hewed us &s;ome Poeticall ficti|ons expre&s;&s;ed by the pencill in the windowes and on the wain&s;cot, and &s;eemed to glory much in them. I confe&s;&s;e they might have plentifully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my fancy, had I not &s;een the window of <HI>Gorrambury gallery,</HI> belonging to the Right Ho|norable <HI>Francis Vi&s;count</HI> St. <HI>Albans;</HI> a window in which all the Fables of <HI>Ovids Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> are &s;o naturally and lively di&s;&s;embled, that if ever art went beyond it &s;elf, it was in that admirable expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of the water-works, and here we &s;hall &s;ee in the fir&s;t water-hou&s;e, which is a &s;tately large walk vaulted over head, the effigies of a Dragon, ju&s;t again&s;t the entrance; an unquiet bea&s;t that vomiteth on all that come nigh it. At the end toward the right hand is the Statua of a Nymph &s;itting before a paire of Organs. Upon the loo&s;ing of one of the pipes, the Nymphs fingers began to manage the keyes, and brought the in&s;trument to yield &s;uch a mu&s;ick, that if it were not that of an Organ, it was as like it as could be, and not be the &s;ame. Unto the divi&s;ion of her fingers, her head kept a porportionable time; jolting from one &s;houlder to the other, as I have have &s;een an old fidler at a Wake. In the &s;ame proportion were the counterfeits of all &s;orts of mils, w^c^h before very eagerly di&s;charged their functi|ons;
<PB N="62" REF="56">
but upon the beginning of this harmony, they &s;ud|denly &s;tood &s;till, as if they had had ears to have heard it. At the other end towards the left hand, we &s;aw a &s;hop of Smiths, another of Joiners, and a back&s;ide full of Sawyers and Ma&s;ons, all idle. Upon the fir&s;t command of the water, they all fell to their Occupations, and plyed them lu&s;tily; the birds every where &s;inging, and &s;o &s;aving the Artificers the labour of a whi&s;tling. Be&s;ides, upon the drawing of a wood|den courtain, there appeared unto us, two Tritons riding on their Dolphins, and each of them with a &s;hell in his hand, which interchangeably and in turns &s;erved them in &s;tead of trumpets. A very happy <HI>decorum,</HI> and truly Poe|ticall.</P>

<P>Afterward followes Neptune him&s;elf, fitting in his Chariot, drawn with four Tortoy&s;es, and gra&s;ping his <HI>tricu&s;pis</HI> or three forked Scepter in his hand: the water under them repre|&s;enting, all this while, a &s;ea &s;omewhat troubled. 36 &s;teps from the front of the hou&s;e we de&s;cended into this water-hou&s;e; and by 60 more we de&s;cended into a &s;econd of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, but not of an equall length with the other. At the right hand of this, is the whole &s;tory of <HI>Per&s;eus, Andro|meda</HI> and the Whale lively acted; the Whale being killed, and the Lady unloo&s;ed from the rock very perfectly. But withall, it was &s;o cunningly managed, and that with &s;uch a mutuall change of fortune, on the parties of both the comba|tants, that one who had not known the fable, would have been &s;ore affraid that the Knight would have lo&s;t the victo|ry, and the Lady her life.

<P>There appeared unto us the re&s;emblance of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> playing on a treble Viall, the trees moving with the force of the

Upon the opening of a double-leaved door, there were exhibited to us divers repre&s;entations and conceits, which certainly might have been more gracefull, if they had not &s;o much in them of the puppet play. By &s;ome &s;teps more we de&s;cended into the Garden, and by as many more into a Green, which opened into the water &s;ide; in which the goodlie&s;t flower and mo&s;t plea&s;ing to my eyes, was the <HI>&s;tatua</HI> of an hor&s;e in bra&s;&s;e, of that bigne&s;&s;e, that I and one of my companions could &s;tand in the neck of him. But di&s;mounting from this hor&s;e, we mounted our own, and &s;o took our leaves of St. <HI>Germain.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of <HI>Paris,</HI> and up the river, we &s;aw an other of the Kings hou&s;es, called St. <HI>Vincent</HI> or <HI>Vincennes.</HI> It was beautified with a large part by <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus, anno</HI> 1185. who al&s;o walled the Park, and repleni&s;hed it with Deer.

<P>It hath had in diversages, two &s;everall names; the one taken from the people, the other from the &s;ituation; the name taken from the people is that of <HI>Paris. J. Cae&s;ar</HI> in his <HI>Commentaries</HI> making mention of the Nation of the <HI>Pari&s;ii,</HI> and at that time calling this City <HI>Urbem Pari&s;iorum. Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> calleth it by the &s;ame appellative; for as yet the name of <HI>Paris</HI> was not appropriated unto it. As for the&s;e <HI>Pari&s;ii,</HI> it is well known that they were a people of <HI>Gallia Celtica;</HI> but why the people were &s;o called, hath been que&s;ti|oned, and that de&s;ervedly. Some derive them from a &s;on of <HI>Paris</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Priam:</HI> but the humour of deriving all nationall originations from <HI>Troy,</HI> hath long &s;ince been hi&s;&s;ed out of the Schoole of Antiquity. The <HI>Bero&s;us</HI> of <HI>John Annius</HI> bringeth them from one <HI>Paris</HI> King of the <HI>Celtae;</HI> and his au|thority is alike authenticall. The ba&s;tards which this <HI>Annius</HI> impo&s;ed upon the Antient writers, are now taught to know their own father. Others deduce it from <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Greek word importing boldne&s;&s;e of &s;peech; which is approved by <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Breton,</HI> in the fir&s;t book of his <HI>Phillipiades.</HI></P>

<P>It is &s;poken of tho&s;e <HI>Gaules,</HI> who coming out of the more Southern parts, here planted them&s;elves. Neither is it im|probable, that a <HI>Gallick</HI> nation &s;hould a&s;&s;ume to it &s;elf a Greek name, that language having taken good footing in the&s;e parts, long before <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> time, as him&s;elf te&s;tifyeth in his <HI>Commentaries.</HI> How well this name agreeth with the <HI>French</HI> nature, I have already manife&s;ted in the character of this people, both men and women. But I will not &s;tand to this <HI>etymologie.</HI> The names of great Cities are as ob&s;cure as tho&s;e of their founders; and the conjecturall derivations of them are oftentimes rather plau&s;ible then probable; and &s;ometimes neither. As for the antiquity of it, it is &s;aid to be built in the time of <HI>Ama&s;ia</HI> King of <HI>Judah;</HI> but this al&s;o is uncertain: the beginnings of antient Cities, being as dark and hidden, as the rea&s;ons of their names. Cer|tain it is, that it is no <HI>pui&s;n&egrave;</HI> in the world; it be|ing a &s;trong and opulent Town in the dayes of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>The other name of this City, which is indeed the anti|ent, and was taken from the &s;ituation of it, is <HI>Lutetia,</HI> from <HI>lutum</HI> dirt; as being &s;eated in an exceeding clammy and dirty &s;oil.

<L>Their City dirty: for that rea&s;ons &s;ake,</L>
<L>The Town, the name <HI>Lutetia</HI> did take.</L></NOTE></L>
</LG>
<P>As for the <HI>Etymologie</HI> of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> who deriveth the name from <HI>Luens</HI> one of the Kings of the <HI>Celtae:</HI> it may (for ought I know) de&s;ervedly keep company with that of <HI>Bero&s;us,</HI> al|ready recited. This name of <HI>Lutetia</HI> continued till the com|ing of the <HI>Franks</HI> into the&s;e parts: who to endeer the nation of the <HI>Pari&s;ii,</HI> and oblige them the more faithfully to do them &s;ervice, commanded it for ever after to be called <HI>Paris.</HI> But the &s;ituation of this Town gave it not only the name; it gave it al&s;o (as the cu&s;tome of Godfathers in <HI>Eng|land)</HI> a chri&s;tning gift, which is the riches of it; and by con|&s;equence, the preheminence. In how delicate and flouri&s;h|ing a &s;oil it is &s;ituate, I have already told you in my de|&s;cription of the vally of <HI>Montmorencie</HI> where it &s;tandeth. If you will believe <HI>Comines</HI> in the fir&s;t book of his Hi&s;tories, he will tell you, that <HI>Ce&s;t la cit&egrave; que jamais ie vei&s;&s;e environne&egrave; de meilleux pais et plantureux;</HI> of all the Cities which ever he &s;aw, it is environed with the be&s;t and fruitful'&s;t Countrey. The river of <HI>Seine</HI> is al&s;o, no que&s;tion, a great help to the en|riching of it; for though it be not Navigable unto the Town, yet it giveth free pa&s;&s;age unto boats of an indiffe|rent big burden, into which the &s;hips are unladen, and &s;o their commodities carryed up the water. A profitable en|ter cour&s;e between the Sea and the City for the Merchants. Of the&s;e boats there are an infinite company that plie up and down the water, and more indeed, as the &s;aid <HI>Comines</HI> is of opinion, than any man can believe that hath not &s;een them.</P>
<P>It is in circuite, as <HI>Boterus</HI> is of opinion, 12 miles. Others judge it at 10. For my part, I dare not gue&s;&s;e it to be above 8, and yet I was told by a <HI>French</HI> man, that it was in com|pa&s;&s;e no le&s;&s;e then 14 leagues within the wals; an untruth bigger then the Town. For figure it is circular, that being, according to <HI>Geometricians,</HI> of all figures the mo&s;t capacious. And que&s;tionle&s;&s;e if it be true, that <HI>Urbs non in moenibus, &s;ed
<PB N="67" REF="58">
in civibus po&s;ita e&s;t; Paris</HI> may challenge as great a circuit as the mo&s;t of <HI>Europe:</HI> it being little inferiour to the bigge&s;t, for the multitudes of her inhabitants. Joyne the compa&s;&s;e and the populou&s;ne&s;&s;e together, and you &s;hall hear the wi&s;e&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> men &s;ay, that <HI>Que ce qu' e&s;t l' ame a la rai&s;on, el la prunelle a l' oeil; cela me&s;me e&s;t Paris a la France.</HI> Add to this the verdict of <HI>Charles</HI> V. who being demanded which he thought to be the bigge&s;t City of <HI>France:</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>Roven:</HI> and being then asked, what he thought of <HI>Paris:</HI> made an|&s;wer, <HI>Unpais;</HI> that it was a whole Countrey. The Empe|rour did well to flatter <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t, who asked him the&s;e que&s;tions, and in who&s;e power he then was; other|wi&s;e he might have given men good cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his judgement. The truth is, that <HI>Paris</HI> is a fair and goodly Town; yet withall, it is nothing like the miracle that &s;ome men make it. Were the figure of <HI>London</HI> altered, and all the hou&s;es of it ca&s;t into a Ring; I dare able it a larger and more goodly Town then <HI>Paris,</HI> and that in the compari&s;on, it may give it at the lea&s;t half a mile oddes.</P>
<P>For matter of &s;trength and re&s;i&s;tance, certain it is that this City is exceeding well &s;eated, were it as well fortifyed. It lyeth in a plain flat levell, and hath no hils nigh unto it, from which it can any way be annoyed; and for the ca&s;ting and making of rowling-trenches, I think the &s;oil is hardly &s;erviceable. If Art were no more wanting to the &s;trength of it then Nature, in mine opinion, it might be made almo&s;t impregnable. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. &s;eeing the pre&s;ent weakne&s;&s;e of it, had once a purpo&s;e (as it is &s;aid) to have &s;trengthned it ac|cording to the modern art of Fortifications. But it went no further then the purpo&s;e. He was a great builder, and had many projects of Ma&s;onry in his head, which were little for his profit; and this would have proved le&s;&s;e then any. For be&s;ides the infinite &s;ums of mony which would have been employed in &s;o immen&s;e a work; what had this been in effect, but <HI>to put a &s;word into the hand of a mad man?</HI> The mu|tinies and &s;edition of this people have made it little infe|riour to <HI>Leige</HI> or <HI>Gaunt,</HI> the two mo&s;t revolting Towns of <HI>Europe.</HI> And again, the <HI>Baricadoes</HI> again&s;t the per&s;on of King <HI>Henry</HI> III. and the large re&s;i&s;tance it made to him&s;elf,
<PB N="68" REF="59">
being weak; were &s;ufficient to in&s;truct him what might be expected from it by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, when it &s;hould be &s;trength|ned and inabled to rebellion.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;trength of the Town then is not great, the wals being very weak and ruinous; and tho&s;e other few helps which it hath, being little availeable for defence. The beautifulle&s;t part of the whole re&s;i&s;tance is the ditch, deep, precipitate and broad; and to &s;ay no more of it, an excel|lent ward, were there any thing el&s;e corre&s;pondent to it. As for the Fort next unto St. <HI>Antonies</HI> gate, called the <HI>Ba&s;tille;</HI> it is in my conceit too little to protect the Town, and too low to command it. When Swords only and Pick-axes were in u&s;e, and afterwards in the infancie of guns, it did &s;ome &s;ervice in the nature of a Fortre&s;&s;e: now it &s;erveth prin|cipally as a pri&s;on for tho&s;e of the greater &s;ort, who will permit them&s;elves to be taken. It is &s;aid to be built by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when they were Lords of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the vulgar are all of this opinion. Others, of the more learned &s;ort, make it to be the work of one of the Provo&s;ts of the City. <HI>Du Che&s;ne</HI> calleth him <HI>Hugues Aubriot,</HI> in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> V. when as yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had nothing to do here. The word <HI>Ba&s;tille</HI> in generall, &s;ignifieth a Fortre&s;&s;e; the article <HI>la,</HI> pre|fixed before it, maketh it a name, and appropriateth it unto this building. There are al&s;o two little turrets, ju&s;t again&s;t the gallery of the <HI>Louure,</HI> on both &s;ides of the <HI>Seine,</HI> inten|ded for the defence of the River; though now they are little able to an&s;wer that intention: they al&s;o are fathered on the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but how true I know not. An other place I marked, de&s;igned perhaps for a Rampart, but imployed at this time only by windmils. It is a goodly mount of earth, high and capacious, &s;ituate clo&s;e unto the gate called St. <HI>Martins;</HI> the mo&s;t defen&s;ible part, if wel manned, of all <HI>Paris.</HI> Thus is the &s;trength of this Town (as you &s;ee) but &s;mall; and if <HI>Henry</HI> IV. lay &s;o long before it with his Army, it was not becau&s;e he could not take it, but becau&s;e he would not. He was loath (as <HI>Biron</HI> advi&s;ed him) to receive the bird naked, which he expected with all its feathers; and this an&s;wer he gave the Lord <HI>Willougbie.</HI> who undertook to force an en|try into it.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="59">
For the <HI>&s;treets,</HI> they are many of them of a lawfull and competent breadth, well pitched under the foot with fair and large peble. This paving of it was the work of <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus, anno</HI> 1223. or there abouts; before which time it could not but be mi&s;erably dirty, if not unpa&s;&s;able. As it now is, the lea&s;t rain maketh it very &s;lippery and trouble|&s;ome; and as little a continuance of warme weather, &s;tink|ing and poi&s;onous. But whether this noi&s;omene&s;&s;e pro|ceed from the nature of the ground, or the flutti&s;hne&s;&s;e of the people in their hou&s;es, or the neglect of the Magi&s;trates in not providing a &s;ufficiency of Scavengers, or all, I am not to determine. This I am confident of, that the na&s;tie&s;t lane in <HI>London,</HI> is Frankincen&s;e and Juniper, to the &s;weete&s;t &s;treet in this City. The antient by-word was (and there is good rea&s;on for it) <HI>Il de&s;taint comme la fange de Paris:</HI> had I the power of making proverbs, I would only change <HI>il de&s;taint</HI> into <HI>il puit,</HI> and make the by-word ten times more Ortho|dox. I have &s;poken &s;omewhat already of the Fortificati|ons of this Town, but they are but trifles: the only venome of the &s;treet, is a &s;trength unto it more powerfull then the ditch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s or the bulwark of St. <HI>Martins. Morri&s;on</HI> in his <HI>Itine|rarie</HI> relateth how the Citizens of <HI>Prague</HI> in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> were repairing the wals of their Town for fear of the <HI>Turkes;</HI> but with all he addeth, that if the &s;tink of the &s;treets kept him not thence, there was no a&s;&s;urance to be looked for of the wals. I know now not how true it is of that City, I am &s;ure it may be ju&s;tly verified of this. It was therefore not unjudiciou&s;ly &s;aid of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, that he thought <HI>Paris</HI> was the &s;tronge&s;t Town in Chri&s;tendome; for he took (&s;trong) in that &s;en&s;e as we do in <HI>England,</HI> when we &s;ay &s;uch a man hath a <HI>&s;trong-breath.</HI> The&s;e things con&s;idered, it could not but be an infinite happine&s;&s;e granted by nature to our <HI>Henry</HI> V. that he never &s;topped his no&s;e at any &s;tink, as our Chronicles report of him. Otherwi&s;e, in my con&s;cience, he had never been able to keep his Court there. But that which mo&s;t amazed me, is, that in &s;uch a perpetuated con&s;tancy of &s;tinks, there &s;hould yet be found &s;o large and admirable a variety. A variety &s;o &s;peciall and di&s;tinct, that any Chymicall no&s;e (I dare l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y my life on it)

<P>For the <HI>buildings,</HI> they are I confe&s;&s;e very hand&s;omely and uniformely &s;et out to the &s;treet-ward; not un&s;eemly in them&s;elves, and very &s;utable one with another.

The hou&s;es of the new mould in <HI>London,</HI> are ju&s;t after their fa&s;hion: wherein the care and de&s;igne of our late Soveraign King <HI>James</HI> is highly to be magnifyed. Time and his good beginnings well &s;econded, will make that City nothing inferiour for the beauty and excellency of her &s;tructures, to the gallante&s;t of <HI>Europe;</HI> in|&s;omuch that he might truly have &s;aid of his <HI>London,</HI> what <HI>Augu&s;ius</HI> did of his <HI>Rome,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Urbem quem lateritiam inveni marmoream relinquo,</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> hath it.

Their Mercers are but one degree removed from a Pedler; &s;uch as in <HI>England</HI> we call Chapmen, that is a Pedler with a &s;hop.

But concerning the ridiculous bravery of the poor <HI>Pari&s;ian,</HI> take along with you this &s;tory: Upon our fir&s;t coming into <HI>Paris,</HI> there came to vi&s;it a <HI>German Lord,</HI> whom we met a &s;hip-bord, a couple of <HI>French Gallants,</HI> his acquaintance; the one of them (for I
<PB N="72" REF="61">
did not much ob&s;erve the other) had a &s;uit of <HI>Turkie grogram</HI> doubled with Taffeta, cut with long &s;la&s;hes, or carbona|do's, after the <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hion, and belaied with bugle lace. Through the openings of his doublet appeared his &s;hirt of the pure&s;t Holland, and wrought with curious needle|work; the points at his wa&s;te and knees, all edged with a &s;ilver edging; his garters, ro&s;es and hat-band, &s;utable to his points; a beaver hat, and a pair of &s;ilk &s;tockins; his cloke al&s;o of <HI>Turkey grogram,</HI> cut upon black Taffeta. This Lord (for who would have dared to gue&s;&s;e him other?) applyed him&s;elf to me, and perceiving my ignorance in the <HI>French,</HI> acco&s;ted me in <HI>Latine,</HI> which he &s;pake indifferently well. Af|ter &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, he took notice of mine eyes, which were then &s;ore and &s;ea-&s;ick, and promi&s;ed me, if I would call on him at his lodging the next morning, to give me a water, which &s;uddenly would re&s;tore them to their &s;trength and vigor. I humbly thanked his Lord&s;hip for &s;uch an ineffable and immerited favour, in the be&s;t complement and greate&s;t obei&s;ance I could devi&s;e. It was not for nought, thought I, that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> extoll &s;o muth the humanity of this people; nay I began to accu&s;e the report of envy, as not having publi&s;hed the one half of their graces and affabilities. <HI>Quan|tillum enim virtutum illarum acceperim!</HI> And thus taking my leave of his Honor, I greedily expected the next morning. The morning come, and the hour of vi&s;ting his Lord|&s;hip almo&s;t at hand, I &s;ent a &s;ervant to fetch a Barber to come trim me and make me neat, as not knowing what occa&s;ion I might have, of &s;eeing his Lady or his daughters. Upon the return of the me&s;&s;enger, pre&s;engly fol|loweth his Altitude, and bidding me &s;it down in his chair, he disburdened one of his pockets <HI>(Quis hoc credat, ni&s;i &s;it pro+te&s;te vetu&s;tas?)</HI> of a ca&s;e of in&s;truments, and the other of a bun|dle of linnen.

<P>The&s;e <HI>Fauxbourgs</HI> are not incorporated unto the Town, or joyned together with it, as the Suburbs of <HI>London</HI> are unto that City. They &s;tand &s;evered from it a pretty di&s;tance, and appear to be what indeed they are, a di&s;tinct body from it; For the mo&s;t part the hou&s;es in them are old and ruinous: yet the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> of St. <HI>Iacques</HI> is in a prety good fa&s;hion and the lea&s;t un&s;ightly of them all, except St. <HI>Germains.</HI> The <HI>Faux|bourg</HI> al&s;o of St. <HI>Marcell</HI> hath &s;omewhat to commend it, which is that the great Pe&s;t-hou&s;e built by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. is within the Precincts of it: a hou&s;e built quadrangular wi&s;e, very large and capacious; and &s;eemeth to &s;uch as &s;tand afar off it (for it is not &s;afe venturing nigh it or within) to be more like the Palace of a King, then the Kings Palace it &s;elf. But the principalle&s;t of all the Suburbs is that of St. <HI>Germains,</HI> a place lately repaired, full of divers &s;tately hou&s;es, and in bigne&s;&s;e little inferior unto <HI>Oxford.</HI> It took name from the Abbey of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Germain,</HI> &s;eated within it, built by <HI>Childebert</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Clouis, anno</HI> 1542. in the honor of St. <HI>Vincent.</HI> Afterwards it got the name of St. <HI>German</HI> a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who&s;e body was there buried, and at who&s;e in&s;tigation it had former|ly been founded. The number of the Monks was enlarged to the number of 120 by <HI>Charles the balde,</HI> (he began his reign <HI>anno</HI> 841) and &s;o they continue till this day.

<P>The principall hou&s;e in it is that of the Queen Mother, not yet fully built.

politene&s;&s;e of the Fabrick, not fellowed in <HI>Europe.</HI> A Palace an&s;werable to the greatne&s;&s;e of her mind that built it; yet it is by divers conjectured that her purpo&s;e is never to re&s;ide there: for which cau&s;e the building goeth but &s;lowly forward. For when upon the death of her great Privado, the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>D'Ancre,</HI> &s;he was removed to <HI>Blois:</HI> tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite tacti|on in the Court got &s;o &s;trongly into the good opinion of the King, that not without great &s;truglings, by tho&s;e of her party, and the hazard of two civill wars, &s;he obtained her former neerne&s;&s;e to his Maje&s;ty. She may &s;ee by this what to tru&s;t to, &s;hould her ab&s;ence leave the Kings mind any way prepared for new impre&s;&s;ions. Likely therefore it is, that &s;he will rather choo&s;e to leave her fine hou&s;e unhabited fur|ther then on occa&s;ions for a Banquet, then give the lea&s;t op|portunity to &s;tagger her greatne&s;&s;e. This hou&s;e is called <HI>Luxembourg Palace,</HI> as being built in place of an old hou&s;e belonging to the Duke of that Province. The &s;econd hou&s;e of note in this Suburb is that of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> to whom it was given by the Queen Mother, in the fir&s;t year of her Regency.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Paris,</HI> is that part of it, which lyeth on this &s;ide of the hithermo&s;t branch of the <HI>Seine</HI> towards <HI>Picar|die.</HI> What was &s;poken before in the generall hath its refe|rence to this particular; whether it concern the &s;weetne&s;&s;e of the &s;treets, the manner of the building, the furniture of the artificer, or the like.

<P>The principall Governour of <HI>Paris,</HI> as al&s;o of the whole I&s;le of <HI>France,</HI> is the Duke of <HI>Monbazon,</HI> who hath held this office ever &s;ince the year 1619. when it was &s;urrendred by

The <HI>Provo&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Merchants,</HI> and his authority was fir&s;t in&s;tituted by <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus,</HI> who began his reign <HI>anno</HI> 1190. His office is to con|&s;erve the liberties and indulgences, granted to the Merchants and Artificers of the City: to have an eye over the &s;ales of Wine, Corn, Wood, Cole, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to impo&s;e taxes on them; to keep the keyes of the Gates, to give watch word in time of war; to grant Pa&s;t-ports to &s;uch as are willing to leave the Town, and the like. There are al&s;o four other Officers joyned unto him, <HI>E&s;cbevins</HI> they call them, who al&s;o car|ry a great &s;way in the City. There are moreover A&s;&s;i|&s;tants to them in their proceedings, the Kings <HI>Sollicitour</HI> (or <HI>Procureur)</HI> and 24 <HI>Coun&s;ellours.</HI> To compare this Corpora|tion with that of <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Provo&s;t</HI> is as the <HI>Maior,</HI> the <HI>E&s;chevins</HI> as the <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> the 24 <HI>Coun&s;ellours</HI> as the <HI>Aldermen,</HI> and the <HI>Procureur</HI> as the <HI>Recorder.</HI> I omit the under-officers, whereof there is no &s;carcity.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat part of <HI>Paris</HI> which lyeth beyond the further|mo&s;t branch of the <HI>Seine,</HI> is called the Univer&s;ity. It is little inferiour to the Town for bigne&s;s, and le&s;&s;e &s;uperior to it in &s;weetne&s;s or opulency. What&s;oever hath been &s;aid of the whole in general, was intended to this part al&s;o, as well as the others: all the learning in it, being not able to free it from tho&s;e inconveniences, where|with it is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. It containeth in it only &s;ix pari&s;h Churches: the paucity whereof is &s;upplyed by the multi|tude of religious hou&s;es, which are within it. The&s;e &s;ix Churches are called by the names of St. <HI>Nicholas du Chardo|nuere,</HI> 2. St. <HI>E&s;tienne,</HI> at this time in repairing. 3. St. <HI>Se|verin.</HI> 4. St. <HI>Bennoi&s;t.</HI> 5. St. <HI>Andre.</HI> And 6. St. <HI>Co&s;ome.</HI> It hath al&s;o eight Gates, <HI>viz. 1. Porte de Ne&s;te,</HI> by the water &s;ide over again&s;t the <HI>Louure. 2.

<PB N="81" REF="65">
1304. at what time the Scholars having lived formerly di&s;per&s;ed about the City, began to &s;ettle them&s;elves toge|ther in this place: and &s;o to become a peculiar Corpo|ration.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity was founded by <HI>Charles</HI> the great, <HI>anno</HI> 791. at the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Alcuine</HI> an <HI>Oxford</HI> man, and the Scho|lar of venerable <HI>Bede:</HI> who brought with him three of his con di&s;ciples to be the fir&s;t readers there: their names were <HI>Rabbanus Maurus, John Erigena,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Scolus; &amp; Claudus,</HI> who was al&s;o called <HI>Clement.</HI> To the&s;e four doth the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Paris</HI> owe its originall and fir&s;t rudiments: nei|ther was this the fir&s;t time, that <HI>England</HI> had been the School|mi&s;tre&s;s unto <HI>France;</HI> we lent them not only their fir&s;t Do|ctors in Divinity and Philo&s;ophy; but from us al&s;o did they receive the my&s;teries of their Religion, when they were Heathens. <HI>Di&s;ciplina in Britannia reperta,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar Com. 6.) atque inde in Galliam tran&s;lata e&s;&s;e exi&s;timatur.</HI> An authority not to be que&s;tioned by any, but by a <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> Learning thus new born at <HI>Paris,</HI> continued not long in any full vigour. For almo&s;t 300 years it was fallen into a deadly trance: and not here only, but al&s;o through the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe: anno</HI> 1160. or thereabouts <HI>Peter Lom|bard,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> the fir&s;t author of Schola&s;tical Divi|nity; and by his followers called the Ma&s;ter of the Sen|tences; revived it here in this Town by the favour and en|couragement of <HI>Lewis</HI> 7. In his own hou&s;e were the Le|ctures fir&s;t read: and after as the numbers of Students did encrea&s;e, in &s;undry other parts of the Town; Colledges they had none till the year 1304. The Scholars till then &s;ojourning in the hou&s;es of the Citizens, accordingly as they could bargain for their entertainment.</P>
<P>But <HI>anno 1304. Joane,</HI> Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> wife to <HI>Philip</HI> the fair, built that Colledge, which then and ever &s;ince hath been called the Colledge of <HI>Navarre:</HI> and is at this day the faire&s;t and large&s;t of all the re&s;t. <HI>Nonibi con&s;tituunt exempla ubi coeperunt, &s;ed in tenuem accepta tramitem, lati&s;&s;ime evagandi viam &s;ibi faciunt:</HI> as <HI>Velleius.</HI> This good example ended not in it &s;elf: but incited divers others of the <HI>French</HI> Kings, and peo|ple, to the erecting of convenient places of &s;tudy. So that
<PB N="82" REF="66">
in proce&s;s of time, <HI>Paris</HI> became enriched with 52 Col|ledges. So many it &s;till hath, though the odde forty are little &s;erviceable unto learning, for in twelve only of them is there any publick reading, either in Divinity or Philo|&s;ophy. Tho&s;e twelve are the Colledges of <HI>Harcourte. 2. Caillvi,</HI> or the <HI>Petit Sorbonne. 3. Li&s;&s;eux,</HI> or <HI>Lexovium. 4 Bon|courte. 5. Montague. 6. Le Marche. 7. Navarre. 8. De la Car|dinal de Moyne. 9. Le Ple&s;&s;is. 10. De Beavais. 11. La Sor|bonne. 12. De Clermont,</HI> or the Colledge of the Je&s;uites: there are al&s;o publique readings in the hou&s;es of the four orders of Fryers Mendicants, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> the <HI>Augu&s;tins,</HI> the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> or <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and the <HI>Dominicans.</HI> The other Colledges are de&s;tinated to other u&s;es. That of <HI>Arras</HI> is converted to an hou&s;e of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fugitives; and there is ano|ther of them hard by the Gate of St. <HI>Jacques,</HI> employed for the reception of the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> In others of them there is lodg|ing allotted out to Students, who for their in&s;tructions have re&s;ort to &s;ome of the 12 Colledges above men|tioned.</P>
<P>In each of the&s;e Colledges there is a Rector: mo&s;t of who&s;e places yeeld to them but &s;mall profit. The greate&s;t commodity which accreweth to them is rai&s;ed from cham|ber Rents: their preferments being much of a nature with that of a Principal of an Hall in <HI>Oxford;</HI> or that of a Trea|&s;urer in an Inne of Chancery in <HI>London.</HI> At the fir&s;t ere|ction of their Colledges, they were all prohibited marriage, though I &s;ee little rea&s;on for it. There can hardly come any inconvenience or dammage by it, unto the &s;cholars un|der their charge, by the a&s;&s;uming of lea&s;es into their own hands: for I think few of them have any to be &s;o imbezled. <HI>Anno</HI> 1520. or thereabouts it was permitted unto &s;uch of them as were Doctors in Phy&s;ick, that they might marry: the Cardinall of <HI>Toute Ville,</HI> Legat in <HI>France,</HI> giving unto them that indulgence. Afterwards in the year 1534. the Doctors of the Lawes petitioned the Univer&s;ity for the like priviledge: which in fine was granted to them, and confir|med by the Court of Parliament. The Doctors of Divi|nity are the only Academicals now barred from it: and that not as Rectors, but as Prie&s;ts. The&s;e Colledges for their
<PB N="83" REF="66">
buildings are very inelegant, and generally little behol|ding to the curio&s;ity of the artificer. So confu&s;ed and &s;o proportioned in re&s;pect of our Colledges in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>Oxford</HI> was &s;ome 12. years &s;ince, in compari&s;on of the re&s;t: or as the two Temples in <HI>London</HI> now are, in re|ference to <HI>Lincolns-Inne.</HI> The revenues of them are &s;uita|ble to the Fabricks, as mean and curtailed. I could not learn of any Colledge, that hath greater allowances then that of <HI>Sorbonne:</HI> and how &s;mall a trifle that is, we &s;hall tell you pre&s;ently. But this is not the poverty of the Univer|&s;ity of <HI>Paris</HI> only: all <HI>France</HI> is troubled with the &s;ame want, the &s;ame want of encouragement in learning: neither are the Academies of <HI>Germanie</HI> in any happier &s;tate, which occa&s;io|ned <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> that great light of his times, having been in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and &s;een <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to write thus to one of his <HI>Dutch</HI> ac|quaintance, <HI>Vnum Collegium Cantabrigien&s;e (confidenter dicam) &s;uperat vel decem no&s;tra.</HI> It holdeth good in the neatne&s;s and graces of the buildings, in which &s;en&s;e he &s;pake it: but it had been more undeniable had he intended it of the reve|nues. Yet I was given to under&s;tand, that at <HI>Tholoze</HI> there was among&s;t 20 Colledges, one of an e&s;peciall quality: and &s;o indeed it is, if rightly con&s;idered. There are &s;aid to be in it 20 Students places, (or fellow&s;hips as we call them). The Students at their entrance are to lay down <HI>in depo&s;ito</HI> 6000. Florens, or Livres; paid unto him after &s;ix years, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: <HI>Vendere jure pote&s;t, emerat ille prius.</HI> A pretty market.</P>
<P>The Colledge of <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> which is indeed the glory of this Univer&s;ity, was built by one <HI>Robert de Sorbonne</HI> of the chamber of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 9. of whom he was very well beloved. It confi&s;teth meerly of Doctors of Divinity: neither can any of another profe&s;&s;ion, nor any of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion not &s;o graduated, be admitted into it. At this time their number is about 70; their allowance, a pint of wine, (their pinte is but a thought le&s;&s;e then our quart) and a certain quantity of bread daily. Meat they have none allowed them, unle&s;s they pay for it: but the pay is not much: for five Sols (which amounteth to &s;ix pence <HI>Engli&s;h)</HI> a day, they may challenge a competency of fle&s;h or fi&s;h, to be &s;erved to
<PB N="84" REF="67">
them at their chambers. The&s;e Doctors have the &s;ole power and authority of conferring degrees in Divinity: the Re|ctor and other officers of the Univer&s;ity, having nothing to do in it. To them alone belongeth the examination of the &s;tudents in the faculty, the approbation, and the be|&s;towing of the honour: and to their Lectures do all &s;uch a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly repair, as are that way minded. All of them in their turnes di&s;charge this office of reading, and that by &s;ixes in a day: three of them making good the Pulpit in the forenoon; and as many in the afternoon. The&s;e Do|ctors are accounted, together with the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> the principal pillars of the <HI>French</HI> Liberty: whereof in|deed they are exceeding jealous, as well in matters Eccle&s;ia|&s;tical as Civil. When <HI>Ger&s;on</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Paris</HI> (he died <HI>Anno</HI> 1429.) had publi&s;hed a book in approbation of the Councell of <HI>Con&s;tance;</HI> where it was enacted that the autho|rity of the Councell was greater then that of the Pope: the <HI>Sorborne</HI> Doctors declared that al&s;o to be their Doctrine. Af|terwards, when <HI>Lewis</HI> the 1, 1. to gratifie Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the 2. purpo&s;ed to aboli&s;h the force of the pragmatick &s;anction; the <HI>Sorbonni&s;ts</HI> in behalf of the Church <HI>Gallican,</HI> and the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Paris; Magnis ob&s;i&s;tebant animis,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Sleidan</HI> in his Commentaries) <HI>&amp; a Papa provocabant ad Concilium.</HI> The Councell unto which they appealed was that of <HI>Ba&s;il;</HI> where that &s;anction was made: &s;o that by this appeal, they veri|fied their former <HI>The&s;is;</HI> that the Councell was above the Pope. And not long &s;ince, <HI>anno viz.</HI> 1613. ca&s;ually mee|ting with a book written by <HI>Becanus,</HI> entituled, <HI>Controver&s;ia Anglicana de pote&s;tate regis &amp; papae:</HI> they called an a&s;&s;embly, and condemned it. For though the main of it, was again&s;t the power and &s;upremacy of the Kings of <HI>England:</HI> yet did it reflect al&s;o on the authority of the Pope over other Chri|&s;tian Kings by the bie, which occa&s;ioned the Sentence. So jealous are they of the lea&s;t circum&s;tances, in which the im|munity of their nation may be endangered.</P>
<P>As for the Government of the Univer&s;ity, it hath for its chief directour, a Rector: with a Chancellor, four Procu|rators or Proctors, and as many others, whom they call <HI>Les Intrantes,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; be&s;ides the Regents. Of the&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="67">
the Regents are &s;uch Ma&s;ters of the Arts, who are by the con&s;ent of the re&s;t, &s;elected to read the publick Lectures of Logick and Philo&s;ophy. Their name they derive <HI>a re|gendo, eo quod in artibus rexerint.</HI> The&s;e are divided into four Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 The <HI>Norman.</HI> 2 The <HI>Picarde.</HI> 3. The <HI>Ger|man.</HI> And 4 The <HI>French.</HI> Under the two fir&s;t are compre|hended the &s;tudents of tho&s;e &s;everal Provinces: under the third, the Students of all forein nations, which repair hi|ther for the attainment of knowledge. It was heretofore called <HI>natio Anglica:</HI> but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being thought unwor|thy of the honour, becau&s;e of their &s;eparation from the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> the name and credit of it was given to the <HI>Germans.</HI> That of the <HI>French</HI> is again &s;ubdivided into two parts: that which is immediately within the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Paris;</HI> and that which containeth the re&s;t of <HI>Gallia.</HI> The&s;e four Nations (for notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubdivi&s;ion above mentioned, the <HI>French</HI> is reckoned but as one) choo&s;e year|ly four Proctors or Procurators; &s;o called, <HI>quia negotia na|tionis &s;uae procurant.</HI> They choo&s;e four other officers, whom they call <HI>les Intrantes:</HI> in who&s;e power there remaineth the Delegated authority of their &s;everal Nations. And here it is to be ob&s;erved, that in the <HI>French</HI> Nation, the Procura|tor, and Intrant, is one year of the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Paris;</HI> and the following year of the re&s;t of <HI>France:</HI> the rea&s;on why that Nation is &s;ubdivided. The&s;e four <HI>Intrantes</HI> thus na|med, have among&s;t them the election of the Rector: who is their &s;upreme Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Rector is named Mr. <HI>Tarrienus,</HI> of the Col|ledge of <HI>Harcourte:</HI> a Ma&s;ter of the Arts, for a Doctor is not capable of the Office. The honour la&s;teth only three moneths; which time expired, the <HI>Intrantes</HI> proceed to a new electi|on: though oftentimes it hapneth that the &s;ame man hath the lea&s;e renued. Within the confines of the Univer&s;ity, he taketh place next after the Princes of the bloud: and at the pub|lique exerci&s;es of learning before the Cardinals, otherwi&s;e he giveth them the precedency. But to Bi&s;hops or Arch|bi&s;hops he will not grant it upon any occa&s;ion. It was not two moneths before my being there, that there hapned a &s;hrewd controver&s;ie about it. For their King had then
<PB N="86" REF="68">
&s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of 25. Bi&s;hops of the Provinces ad|joyning, to con&s;ult about &s;ome Church affairs; and they had cho&s;en the Colledge of <HI>Sorbonne</HI> to be their Senate-hou&s;e: when the fir&s;t day of their &s;itting came, a Doctor of the hou&s;e being appointed to preach before them: began his oration with <HI>Reverendi&s;&s;ime Rector, &amp; vos ampli&s;&s;imi prae&s;ules.</HI> Here the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Roven,</HI> a man of an high &s;pirit, in|terrupted him and commanded him to invert his &s;tile. He obeyed, and pre&s;ently the Rector ri&s;eth up with <HI>Impono tibi &s;ilentium:</HI> which is an injunction within the compa&s;&s;e of his power. Upon this the Preacher being tongue-tied, the con|trover&s;ie grew hot between the Bi&s;hops and the Rector, both parties very eagerly pleading their own priority. All the morning being almo&s;t &s;pent in this altercation, a Cardinal wi&s;er then the re&s;t, de&s;ired that the que&s;tion might for that time be layed a&s;ide: and that the Rector would be plea&s;ed to permit the Doctor to deliver his Sermon, be|ginning it without any praeludium at all. To which reque&s;t the Rector yeelded, and &s;o the contention at that time was ended.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;alus academiae non vertitur in i&s;tis.</HI> It were more for the honour and profit of the Univer&s;ity, if the Rector would leave off to be &s;o mindefull of his place, and look a little to his office. For certainly never the eye and utmo&s;t diligence of a Magi&s;trate was wanting more, and yet more nece&s;&s;ary, then in this place. <HI>Penelopes</HI> &s;uitors never behaved them|&s;elves &s;o in&s;olently in the hou&s;e of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> as the <HI>Acade|micks</HI> here do in the hou&s;es and &s;treets of <HI>Paris.</HI>

Nay, which is mo&s;t horrible, they have regulated their villanous practi&s;es into a Common-wealth: and have their captains and other officers, who command them in their night-walks; and di&s;po&s;e of their purcha&s;es. To be a <HI>Gip&s;ie</HI> and a Scholar of <HI>Paris,</HI> are almo&s;t <HI>Synonyma.</HI> One of their Captains had in one week (for no lon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er would the gallowes let him enjoy his honour) &s;tolne no fewer then 80 cloaks. <HI>Num fuit Autolyci tam piceata manus?</HI> For the&s;e thefts, being apprehended, he was adjudged to the wheel: but becau&s;e the Judges were informed that during the time of his reign, he had kept the hands of him&s;elf and his com|pany unpolluted with bloud; he had the favour to be hanged. In a word, this ungoverned rable, (whom to call &s;cholars were to profane that title) omit no outrages or turbulent mi&s;demeanors, which po&s;&s;ibly can be, or were ever known to be committed in place; which con&s;i&s;teth meerly of priviledge, and nothing of &s;tatute.</P>
<P>I would heartily wi&s;h that tho&s;e who are &s;o ill con|ceited of their own two Univer&s;ities of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and accu&s;e them of di&s;&s;olutene&s;s in their behaviour; would either &s;pend &s;ome time in the Schools beyond &s;eas: or en|quire what newes abroad, of tho&s;e which have &s;een them. Then would they doubtle&s;s &s;ee their own errors, and cor|rect them. Then would they admire the regularity and civility of tho&s;e places, which before they condemned of debauchedne&s;&s;e. Then would they e&s;teem tho&s;e places as the &s;eminary of mode&s;ty and vertue, which they now ac|count as the nur&s;eries only of an impudent rudene&s;s. Such an opinion I am &s;ure &s;ome of the <HI>Aristarchi</HI> of the&s;e daies, have lodged in their brea&s;ts, concerning the mi&s;govern|ment of our <HI>Athens.</HI> Perhaps a kin&s;man of theirs hath played the unthri&s;t, equally of his time and money: hence their malice to it, and their invectives again&s;t it.

<P>An inju&s;tice more unpardonable, then the greate&s;t &s;in of the Univer&s;ities. But I wrong a good cau&s;e with an unne|ce&s;&s;ary patronage.

<P>The principal cau&s;e of the rudene&s;s and di&s;orders in <HI>Paris</HI> have been chiefly occa&s;ioned by the great priviledges where|with the Kings of <HI>France</HI> intended the furtherance and &s;ecu|rity of learning.

their liberties, who is therefore &s;tiled, <HI>Le con&s;ervateur des pri|vileges royaux de l' Univer&s;ite de Paris, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One greater priviledge they have yet then all the&s;e; which is their &s;oon taking of degrees. Two years &s;eeth them Novices in the Arts, and Ma&s;ters of them. So that enjoy|ing by their degrees an ab&s;olute freedome, before the fol|lies and violences of youth are broke in them: they be|come &s;o unruly and in&s;olent, as I have told you. The&s;e degrees are conferred on them by the Chancellor, who &s;el|dome examineth further of them then his &s;ees. Tho&s;e pay|ed, he pre&s;enteth them to the Rector, and giveth them their Letters Patents &s;ealed with the Univer&s;ity Seal: which is the main part of the creation.

<P>THE I&s;le of <HI>Paris,</HI> commonly called <HI>L'I&s;le du Palais,</HI> &s;eated between the Univer&s;ity and the Town: is that part of the whole, which is called <HI>La Cite,</HI> the City, the epitome and ab&s;tract of all <HI>France.</HI> It is the &s;wee|te&s;t and be&s;t ordered part of all <HI>Paris;</HI> and certainly if <HI>Paris</HI> may be thought to be the eye of the Realm; this I&s;land may be equally judged to be the apple of that eye. It is by much the le&s;&s;er part, and by as much the richer, by as much the decenter: and affordeth more variety of objects, then both the other. It containeth an equall number of Pari&s;h Churches, with the Town, and double the number of the Univer&s;ity.

Cae&s;ar</HI> 70 <HI>Comment.) Lutetiam profici&s;citur: id e&s;t opidum Pari&s;iorum po&s;itum in medio fluminis Sequanae.</HI> It is joyned to the main land, and the other parts of this <HI>French</HI> Metropolis, by &s;ix Bridges, two of wood, and four of &s;tone: the &s;tone Bridges, are 1 <HI>Le petit pont,</HI> a Bridge which cer|tainly de&s;erveth that name. 2 <HI>Le pont de No&s;tre dame,</HI> which is all covered with two goodly ranks of hou&s;es: and tho&s;e adorned with portly and antick imagery. 3 <HI>Le pont St. Mi|chell,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e it leadeth towards the Gate of St. <HI>Mi|chell;</HI> hath al&s;o on each &s;ide a beautifull row of hou&s;es: all of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, &s;o exactly, that but by their &s;everall doors, you would &s;carce think them to be &s;everal hou&s;es. they are all new, as being built in the reign of this pre&s;ent King, who&s;e armes is engraven over every door of them.</P>
<P>The fourth and large&s;t Bridge, is that which &s;tandeth at the end of the I&s;le next the <HI>Louure;</HI> and covereth the waters now united again into one &s;tream. It was begun to be built by <HI>Katharine</HI> of <HI>Medices,</HI> the Queen-Mother, <HI>anno</HI> 1578. her Son King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. laying the fir&s;t &s;tone of it. The fini|&s;hing of it was re&s;erved unto <HI>Henry</HI> 4. who as &s;oon as he had &s;etled his affairs in this Town, pre&s;ently &s;et the workmen about it. In the end of it where it joyneth to the Town, there is a water-hou&s;e which by artificiall engines forceth up waters from a fre&s;h &s;pring, ri&s;ing from under the river: done at the charge of this King al&s;o. In the mid&s;t of it is the <HI>Statua</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Henry</HI> 4. all in bra&s;&s;e, mounted on his barbed Steed, of the &s;ame mettle. They are both of them very unproportionable unto tho&s;e which they repre&s;ent: and would &s;hew them big enough, were they placed on the top of <HI>No&s;tre dame Church.</HI> What minded King <HI>Lewis</HI> to make his father of &s;o gigantive a &s;tature, I cannot tell. <HI>Alex|ander</HI> at his return from his <HI>Indian</HI> expedition, &s;cattered Ar|mours, Swords, and Hor&s;ebits, far bigger then were &s;ervice|able: to make future ages admire his greatne&s;&s;e. Yet &s;ome have hence collected, that the acts he performed are not &s;o
<PB N="92" REF="71">
great as they are reported: becau&s;e he &s;trived to make them &s;eem greater then they were. It may al&s;o chance to happen, that men in the times to come, comparing the at|chievements of this King, with his brazen portraiture: may think that the hi&s;torians have as much belied his valour as the &s;tatuary hath his per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>A ponte ad pontifices.</HI> From the Bridge proceed we to the Church, the principal Church of <HI>Paris:</HI> being that <HI>No&s;tre dame.</HI> A Church very uncertain of its fir&s;t founder, though &s;ome report him to be St. <HI>Savinian:</HI> of whom I can meet with no more then his name. But who ever laid the fir&s;t foundation, it much matters not: all the glory of the work being now ca&s;t on <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus;</HI> who pitying the ruines of it, began to build it <HI>anno</HI> 1196. It is a very fair and awfull building, adorned with a very beautiful front, and two towers of e&s;peciall height. It is in length 174 paces, and 60 in bredth: and is &s;aid to be as many paces high: and that the two towers are 70 yards higher then the re&s;t of the Church. At your fir&s;t entrance on the right hand, is the effigies of St. <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> with our Saviour on his &s;houlders. A man, the Legend maketh him as well as the Ma&s;on, of a gyantlike &s;tature; though of the two, the Ma&s;on's workman|&s;hip is the more admirable: his being all cut out of one main &s;tone; that of the <HI>Legendary</HI> being patched up of ma|ny fabulous and ridiculous &s;hreds: it hath in it four ranks of pillars 30 in rank; and 45 little Chappels, or Ma&s;&s;e|clo&s;ets, built between the outermo&s;t range of pillars, and the wals. This is the &s;eat of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> for &s;uch now he is. It was a Bi&s;hoprick only till the year 1622. When Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the 15. at the reque&s;t of King <HI>Lewis,</HI> rai&s;ed it to a Metropolitan&s;hip. But by this addition of honour, I think the pre&s;ent Incumbent hath got nothing, ei|ther in precedency or profit. He had before a nece&s;&s;ary voice in the Court of Parliament, and took place immedi|ately next after the Pre&s;idents, he doth no more now. Be|fore he had the priority of all the Bi&s;hops, and now he is but the la&s;t of all the Archbi&s;hops: a preferment rather in|tellectuall then reall: and perhaps his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may ac|count it a puni&s;hment; for be&s;ides that the dignity is too

But had he nothing in him, this alone were &s;ufficient to make him famous to po&s;terity, that he was the fir&s;t Archbi&s;hop, and the la&s;t Bi&s;hop of the City of <HI>Paris.</HI> There is moreover in this Church a Dean, 7 Digni|ties, and 50 Canons. The Deans place is valued at 4000 Livres, the Dignities at 3000, and the Canons at 2000; no great intrados: and yet unproportionable to the Archbi|&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dieppe</HI> (as I have &s;aid) I ob&s;erved the fir&s;t Idolatry of the Papi&s;ts: here I noted their fir&s;t &s;uper&s;titions; which were the needle&s;&s;e u&s;e of Holy water, and the burning of Lamps before the Altar. The fir&s;t is &s;aid to have been the inven|tion of Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the 7. Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> in their ac|count after <HI>Peter.</HI> I dare not give &s;o much credit unto <HI>Pla|tina,</HI> as to believe it of this antiquity; much le&s;s unto <HI>Bel|larmine,</HI> who deriveth it from the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves. In this paradox, he hath enemies enough at home, his own Doctors being all for <HI>Alexander,</HI> yet they al&s;o are not in the right. The principall foundation of their opinion, is an Epi&s;tle decretory of this <HI>Alexander:</HI> which in it &s;elf carri|eth its own confuta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. The citations of Scripture, on which this Super&s;tition is thought to be grounded, are all taken out of the vulgar Latine tran&s;lation attributed to St. <HI>Hierome,</HI> whereas neither was there in the time of <HI>Alex|ander</HI> any publick Tran&s;lation of the Bible into Latine: neither was St. <HI>Jerome</HI> born within 300 years after him. Holy-water then is not of &s;uch a &s;tanding in the Church, as the Papi&s;ts would per&s;wade us: and as yet I have not met with any, that can ju&s;tly inform me at what time the Church received it; many corruptions they have among them where|of neither they nor we can tell the beginnings.</P>

Bellarmine</HI> main|taineth it a principall remedy, <HI>ad remi&s;&s;ionem peccatorum venia|lium,</HI> and &s;aith; that this was the perpetuall doctrine of the Church. <HI>Augu&s;tin Steuchus</HI> in his Commentaries on Num|bers, leaveth out <HI>venialia,</HI> and pronounceth it to be nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>ut ad ejus a&s;per&s;um delicta no&s;tra deleantur,</HI> &s;o omnipotent is this Holy-water, that the bloud of our Saviour Chri&s;t may be in a manner judged unnece&s;&s;ary; but it is not only u&s;ed in the Churches, the <HI>Rituale Romanum,</HI> of which I &s;pake but now, alloweth any of the faithfull to carry it away with them in their ve&s;&s;els, <HI>ad a&s;pergendos aegros, domos, agros, vineas &amp; alia: &amp; ad habendam eam in cabiculis &s;uis.</HI> To which pur|po&s;es you cannot but think this water to be exceeding &s;er|viceable.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;uper&s;tition which this Church &s;hewed me was the continuall burning of a Lamp before the Altar, a ceremony brought into the Churches (as it is likely) by Pope <HI>Innocent 3. anno</HI> 1215. at what time he ordained that there &s;hould a pix be bought to cover the bread, and that it &s;hould be therein re&s;erved over the Altar. This honour one of late times hath communicated al&s;o unto the virgin <HI>Mary:</HI> who&s;e image in this Church, hath a lanthorn <HI>ex dia|metro</HI> before it: and in that a candle perpetually burning.

No que&s;tion but Pope <HI>Innocent,</HI> when he ordered this Ve&s;tall fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e to be kept among&s;t the Chri&s;tians, thought he had done God good &s;er|vice in reviving his old Commandement given to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Exod.</HI> 27. 20, 21 if &s;o, the world cannot clear him of <HI>Judai&s;m;</HI> therefore the be&s;t way were to &s;ay he learned it of the <HI>Gentiles:</HI> For we read that the <HI>Athenians</HI> had <HI>Lychnum inextincti luminis,</HI> before the Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their <HI>Pallas:</HI> that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> al&s;o had <HI>Ignem pervigilem</HI> in their Temples: and &s;o al&s;o had the <HI>Medi|ans</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yrians.</HI> To omit the everla&s;ting fire of <HI>Ve&s;ta</HI> and come neer home, we meet with it al&s;o here in <HI>Britain; In Britannia quoque</HI> (&s;aith a good Philo&s;opher) <HI>Minervae numen colitur, in cujus temploperpetui ignes, &amp;c.</HI> Afterwards the flattery of the Court applying divine honours unto their Kings, this cu&s;tome of having fire continually burning before them, began to grow in fa&s;hion among the <HI>Romans. Herodian</HI> a|mong&s;t other the en&s;ignes of imperiall maje&s;ty, is &s;ure not to omit this, and therefore telleth us, that notwith&s;tanding <HI>Commodus</HI> was fallen out with his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Lucilla,</HI> he permitteth her her antient &s;eat in the Theatre, <GAP DESC="foreign">, and that fire &s;hould &s;till be carryed before her.

<P>Indeed, in the word <HI>fluminea,</HI> the Poet was &s;omewhat out, the waters only of the Sea &s;erving for the expiation of any crime; the rea&s;on was, <HI>Cum propter vim igneam magnopere purga|tionibus con&s;entanea putaretur;</HI> and for this cau&s;e que&s;tionle&s;&s;e, do the Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts u&s;e &s;alt in the con&s;ecration of their holy-water; that it might as nigh as was po&s;&s;ible, re&s;em|ble the waters of the Sea in &s;altne&s;&s;e.

<P>But I have kept you too long within the Church, it is now time to go up to the top, and &s;urvey the outworks of it. It hath, as we have already &s;aid, at the front two Towers of ad|mirable beauty; they are both of an equal height, and are each of them 377 &s;teps in the a&s;cent. From hence we could clearly &s;ee the whole circuite of <HI>Paris,</HI> and each &s;everall &s;treet of it; &s;uch as we have already de&s;cribed, of an orbicular form and

neatly compacted. From hence could we &s;ee the whole valley round about it, &s;uch as I have al&s;o delineated already, though not in &s;uch lively colours as it meriteth.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e Towers there is a ring of Bels, in the other two only, but the&s;e for worth are equall to all the re&s;t; the bigger of the two is &s;aid to be greater then the Bell of <HI>Roven</HI> &s;o much talked of; as being 8 yards and a &s;pan in compa&s;&s;e, and two yards and a half in depth; the bowl al&s;o of the clapper being one yard and a quarter round: of a great weight it needs mu&s;t be, and therefore
<Q><L>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus,</L></Q>
there are no le&s;&s;e then four main ropes, be&s;ides their &s;everall tale-ropes, to ring it. By rea&s;on of this trouble it is never rung, but in time of thunders, and tho&s;e no mean ones nei|ther, le&s;&s;er bels will &s;erve to di&s;per&s;e the le&s;&s;er tempe&s;ts; this is u&s;ed only in the horrider claps, and &s;uch as threaten a di&s;&s;olution of nature. But how well, as well this as the &s;maller bels di&s;charge that office, experience would tell us were we void of rea&s;on; yet &s;o much do the people affiance them&s;elves to this conceit of the power of them, that they &s;uppo&s;e it inherent to them continually, after the Bi&s;hop hath baptized them; which is done in this manner. The bell being &s;o hanged that it may be wa&s;hed within and without, in comes the Bi&s;hop in his Epi&s;copall robes, attended by one of his Deacons, and &s;itting by the Bell in his chaire &s;aith with a loud voice the 50, 53, 56, 66, 69, 85, and 12 <HI>P&s;almes,</HI> or &s;ome of them: then doth he exorcize &s;everally the &s;alt and the water, and having conjured the&s;e ingredi|ents into an Holy-water, he wa&s;heth with it the Bell, both on the in&s;ide and the out&s;ide, wiping it dry with a linnen cloth, he readeth the 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, and 150 <HI>P&s;alms;</HI> he draweth a cro&s;&s;e on it with his right thumb dipped in hallowed oyl, <HI>(Chri&s;me</HI> they call it) and then prayeth over it. His prayer fini&s;hed, he wipeth out that cro&s;&s;e, and having &s;aid over the 48 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> he draweth on it with the &s;ame oyl, &s;even other cro&s;&s;es, &s;aying, <HI>Sanctificetur &amp;

Since that time, the <HI>Provo&s;ts</HI> and <HI>E&s;chevins</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> have been e&s;peciall Benefactors unto it. At the fir&s;t en|trance into it, you come into their Chappell, &s;mall, but hand&s;ome and well furni&s;hed; after, you pa&s;&s;e into a long gallery, having four ranks of beds, two clo&s;e to the two wals, and two in the middle. The beds are all &s;utable one to the other; their Valence, Curtains and Rugs being all yellow. At the right hand of it, was a gallery more then double the length of this fir&s;t, &s;o al&s;o fur|ni&s;hed. At the further end of this a door opened into another Chamber, dedicated only to &s;ick women: and within them another room, wherein women with childe are lightned of their burden, and their children kept till &s;even years of age, at the charge of the Ho&s;pitall. At the middle of the fir&s;t gallery towards the left hand,
<PB N="99" REF="74">
were four other ranks of beds, little differing from the re&s;t, but that their furniture was blew; and in them there was no place for any but &s;uch as were &s;omewhat woun|ded, and belonged properly to the Chirurgeon. There are numbred in the whole Ho&s;pitall no fewer then 700 beds (be&s;ides tho&s;e of the attendants, Prie&s;ts, Apothe|caries, <HI>&amp;c)</HI> and in every bed two per&s;ons. One would imagine that in &s;uch a variety of wounds and di&s;ea&s;es, a walke into it, and a view of it, might &s;avour more of curio&s;ity, then di&s;cretion, but indeed it is nothing le&s;&s;e; for be&s;ides that no per&s;on of an infectious di&s;|ea&s;e is admitted into it: which maketh much for the &s;afety of &s;uch as view it; all things are there kept &s;o cleanly, neatly and orderly, that it is &s;weeter walk|ing there then in the be&s;t &s;treet of <HI>Paris,</HI> none ex|cepted.</P>
<P>Next unto the&s;e &s;ucceedeth <HI>La Sancte Chappelle,</HI> &s;ituate in the middle of the <HI>Palais;</HI> a Chappell famous for its forme, but more for its Reliques. It was founded by <HI>Lewis</HI> IX. vulgarly called St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> 1248. and is divi|ded into two parts, the upper and the lower, the lower &s;erving for the keeping of the Reliques; and the upper for celebrating the Ma&s;&s;e. It is a comely &s;pruce Edifice without, but far more curious within; the gla&s;&s;e of it for the excellency of painting, and the Organs for the richne&s;&s;e and elaborate workman&s;hip of the ca&s;e, not giving way to any in <HI>Europe.</HI> I could not learn the number of <HI>Chanoins,</HI> which are maintained in it, though I heard they were places of 300 Crowns revenue. As for their Trea&s;urer, <HI>Le Threa&s;ururier,</HI> &s;o they call their Gover|nour; He hath granted him by e&s;pecall priviledge li|cence to wear all the Epi&s;copall habits, except the Cro&s;ier-&s;taffe; and to bear him&s;elfe as a Bi&s;hop within the liberties of his Chappell. In the top of the up|per Chappell (it is built almo&s;t in forme of a <HI>Synagogue)</HI> there hangeth the true proportion (as they &s;ay) of the Crown of thornes: but of this more when we have gone over the Reliques. I was there divers times to

have &s;een them, but (it &s;eemeth) they were not vi|ble to an <HI>Huganots</HI> eyes; though me thinketh, they might have con&s;idered, that my money was Catho|lique. They are kept, as I &s;aid, in the lower Chap|pell, and are thus mar&s;halled in a Table, hanging in the upper; know then that you may believe that they can &s;hew you the crown of thornes, the bloud which ran from our Saviours bre&s;t, his &s;wadling cloutes, a great part of the Cro&s;&s;e (they al&s;o of <HI>No&s;tre dame</HI> have &s;ome of it) the chaine by which the <HI>Jewes</HI> bound him, no &s;mall peece of the &s;tone of the Sepulchre, <HI>Sauctam toelam tabulae in&s;ertam,</HI> which I know not how to <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Some of the Virgins milke, (for I would not have tho&s;e of St. <HI>Denis</HI> think, that the Virgin gave no other milk, but to them) the head of the Lance which pierced our Saviour, the purple Robe, the Sponge, a piece of his Shroud, the napkin wherewith he was girted when he wa&s;hed his Di&s;ciples feet, the rod of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the heads of St. <HI>Bla&s;e,</HI> St. <HI>Clement,</HI> and St. <HI>Simeon,</HI> and part of the head of <HI>John Bapti&s;t.</HI> Immediately under this recitall of the&s;e Reliques (and venerable ones I dur&s;t &s;ay they were, could I be per&s;waded there were no impo&s;ture in them) there are &s;et down a <HI>Prayer</HI> and an <HI>Anthem,</HI> both in the &s;ame Table; as followeth.</P>

<P>THe Court of Parliament was at the fir&s;t in&s;tituted by <HI>Charles Martell</HI> Grandfather to <HI>Charlemaine,</HI> at &s;uch time as he was <HI>Maire</HI> of the <HI>Palace,</HI> unto the la&s;&s;e and rechle&s;&s;e Kings of <HI>France.</HI> In the beginnings of the <HI>French</HI> Empire, their Kings did ju&s;tice to their people in per&s;on: afterwards bani&s;hing them&s;elves from all the affaires of State, that burden was ca&s;t upon the &s;houlders of their <HI>Maiors;</HI> an office much of a nature with the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aefecti praetorio</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. When this office was be&s;towed upon the &s;aid
<PB N="105" REF="77">
<HI>Charles Martell,</HI> he partly weary of the trouble, partly in|tent about a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of an higher nature, which was, the e&s;tating the Crown in his own po&s;terity; but princi|pally to endeer him&s;elf to the common people, ordained this Court of Parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 720. It con&s;i&s;ted in the be|ginning of 12 <HI>Peers,</HI> the <HI>Prelates</HI> and noble men of the be&s;t fa&s;hion, together with &s;ome of the principalle&s;t of the Kings hou&s;hold. Other Courts have been called the Parliaments with an addition of place, as of <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Roven, &amp;c.</HI> this only <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Parliament. It handled as well cau&s;es of e&s;tate, as tho&s;e of private per&s;ons. For hither did the Amba&s;&s;a|dors of neighbour Princes repaire, to have their audience and di&s;patch; and hither were the Articles agreed on, in the nationall <HI>Synods</HI> of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent to be confirmed and ve|rified; here did the &s;ubjects tender in their homages, and Oaths of fidelity to the King; and here were the appeals heard of all &s;uch as had complained again&s;t the <HI>Comites,</HI> at that time the Governours and Judges in their &s;everall Counties. Being furni&s;hed thus with the prime and choyce&s;t Nobles of the Land, it grew into great e&s;timation abroad in the world; in&s;omuch that the Kings of <HI>Sicilie, Cyprus, Scotland, Bohemia, Portugall,</HI> and <HI>Navarre,</HI> have thought it no di&s;pa|ragement unto them to &s;it in it; and which is more, when <HI>Frederick</HI> II. had &s;pent &s;o much time in quarrels with Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf and the rightne&s;&s;e of his cau&s;e to be examined by this Noble Court of Parliament. At the fir&s;t in&s;titution of this Court, it had no &s;etled place of re&s;idence, being &s;ometimes kept at <HI>Tholoza,</HI> &s;ometimes at <HI>Aix la Chappelle,</HI> &s;ometimes in other places, according as the Kings plea&s;ure, and ea&s;e of the people did require. During its time of peregrination, it was called <HI>Ambulatoire,</HI> follow|ing for the mo&s;t part the Kings Court, as the lower <HI>&s;phaeres</HI> do the motion of the <HI>primum mobile;</HI> but <HI>Philip le bel</HI> (he be|gan his reign <HI>anno</HI> 1286) being to take a journey into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> and to &s;tay there a long &s;pace of time, for the &s;etling of his affaires in that Countrey, took order that this Court of Parliament &s;hould &s;tay behind at <HI>Paris;</HI> where ever &s;ince it hath continued.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="78">
Now began it to be called <HI>Sedentaire</HI> or &s;etled, and al&s;o <HI>peua peu,</HI> by little and little to lo&s;e much of its lu&s;tre. For the chief Princes and Nobles of the Kings retinue, not able to live out of the aire of the Court, withdrew them|&s;elves from the troubles of it; by which means at la&s;t it came to be appropriated to them of the Long robe, as they term them, both Bi&s;hops and Lawyers. In the year 1463. the Prelates al&s;o were removed by the command of <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. an utter enemy to the great ones of his Kingdome, only the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and Abbot of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> being permitted their place in it: &s;ince which time the Profe&s;&s;ors of the civill law have had all the &s;way in it, <HI>Et cedunt arma togae,</HI> as <HI>Tully.</HI></P>
<P>The place in which this Sedentarie Court of Parliament is now kept, is called the <HI>Palace,</HI> being built by <HI>Philip le bel,</HI> and intended to be his man&s;ion or dwelling hou&s;e. He began it in the fir&s;t year of his reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1286. and after|wards a&s;&s;igned a part of it to his Judges of the Parliament: it being not totally and ab&s;olutely quitted unto them till the dayes of King <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. In this the <HI>French</HI> Subjects are beholding to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> by who&s;e good example they got the ea&s;e of a Sedentarie Court: our Law courts al&s;o removing with the King, till the year 1224. when by a Statute in the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> it was appointed to be fixt; and a part of the Kings Palace in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> allotted for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Within the verge of this <HI>Palais</HI> are contained the &s;even Chambers of the Parliament; that called <HI>La grande Chambre;</HI> five Chambers of Inqui&s;ition, <HI>Des Enque&s;tes;</HI> and one other called <HI>La Tournelle.</HI> There are moreover the Chambers, <HI>des aides, des accomptes, de l' edict, des monnoyes,</HI> and one called <HI>La Chambre Royall;</HI> of all which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in their proper places: the&s;e not concerning the common government of the people, but only of the Kings revenues. Of the&s;e &s;even Chambers of Parliament, <HI>La grande Chambre</HI> is mo&s;t famous; and at the building of this hou&s;e by <HI>Philip le bel,</HI> was intended for the Kings bed. It is no &s;uch beautifull piece as the <HI>French</HI> make it, that of <HI>Roven</HI> being far beyond it; although indeed it much excell the

of both habits, both Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall and Secular, u&s;e to &s;it and accompany the King. But this is little to the ea&s;e or bene|fit of the Subject, and as little availeable to try the integrity of the Judges; his pre&s;ence being alwayes foreknown, and &s;o accordingly they prepared. Far better then is it, in the <HI>Grande Signeur,</HI> where the <HI>Divano,</HI> or Councell of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> affairs holden by the <HI>Ba&s;&s;as,</HI> is hard by his bed-chamber which looketh into it: the window which giveth him this entervenue is perpetually hidden with a curtain on the &s;ide of the partition, which is towards the <HI>Divano;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Ba&s;&s;as</HI> and other Judges cannot at any time a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that the Emperor is not li&s;tning to their &s;entences: an action in which nothing is <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Mahometan.</HI></P>
<P>The authority of this Court extendeth it &s;elf unto all cau&s;es within the juri&s;diction of it, not being meerly ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticall. It is a law unto it &s;elf, following no rule written in their &s;entences, but judging according to equity and con&s;cience. In matters criminall of greater con&s;equence, the proce&s;&s;e is here immediately examined, without any pre|paration of it by the inferior Courts; as at the arraignment of the Duke of <HI>Biron:</HI> and divers times al&s;o in matters per&s;o|nall. But their power is mo&s;t eminent in di&s;po&s;ing the affaires of State, and of the Kingdome. For &s;uch preroga|tives have the <HI>French</HI> Kings given hereunto, that they can neither denounce War, nor conclude Peace, without the con|&s;ent (a formall one at the lea&s;t) of this Chamber. An alie|nation of the Lands of the Crown, is not any whit valid, unle&s;&s;e confirmed by this Court: neither are his Edicts in force, till they are here verified: nor his Letters Patents for the creating of a Peer, till they are here allowed of. Mo&s;t of the&s;e, I confe&s;&s;e, are little more then matters of form, the Kings power and plea&s;ure being become boundle&s;&s;e; yet &s;ufficient to &s;hew the body of authority which they once had, and the &s;hadow of it, which they &s;till keep; yet of late they have got into their di&s;po&s;ing one priviledge belong|ing formerly to the <HI>Conventus ordinum,</HI> or the A&s;&s;embly of three E&s;tates, which is the conferring of the regency or pro|tection of their King during his minority.

<P>It cannot be &s;aid but that this Court de&s;erveth not only this, but al&s;o any other indulgence, whereof any one member of the Common-wealth is capable.

<P>Thus have I taken a view of the &s;everall Chambers of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and of their particular juri&s;dictions, as far as my information could conduct me.

happine&s;&s;e, as I conjecture rather of the calling then the men.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have di&s;charged the King of one Palace, and mu&s;t follow him to the other, where we &s;hall finde his re&s;idence. It is &s;eated at the We&s;t &s;ide of the Town or <HI>Ville</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> hard by <HI>Portenufue,</HI> and al&s;o by the new bridge. A hou&s;e of great fame, and which the Kings of <HI>France</HI> have long kept their Court in. It was fir&s;t built by <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus, anno</HI> 1214. and by him in|tended for a Ca&s;tle: it fir&s;t &s;erving to impri&s;on the more potent of the Nobles; and to lay up the Kings trea&s;ury. For that cau&s;e it was well moated, &s;trengthned with wals and drawbridges, very &s;erviceable in tho&s;e times. It had the name of <HI>Louure, qua&s;i L'oeuure,</HI> or the work, the buil|ding, by way of excellency. An etymologie which draw|eth nigher to the ear, then the under&s;tanding, or the eye; and yet the <HI>French</HI> writers would make it a miracle. <HI>Du Che&s;ne</HI> calleth it, <HI>Superbe ba&s;timent, qui n'a &s;on e&s;gal en toute la Chri&s;tient&egrave;;</HI> and you &s;hall hear it called in an other place, <HI>Bestiment qui pa&s;&s;e, aujourd hui en excellence et en gran|deur, tous les autres.</HI> Brave elogies, if all were gold that gli&s;tered. It hath now given up its charge of money and
<PB N="114" REF="82">
great pri&s;oners to the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and at this time &s;erveth only to impri&s;on the Court. In my life, I never &s;aw any thing more abu&s;ed by a good report, or that more belyeth the rumors that go of it. The ordinary talk of vul|gar travellers, and the big words of the <HI>French,</HI> had made me expect at the lea&s;t &s;ome prodigie of architecture; &s;ome &s;uch Maje&s;ticall hou&s;e as the Sunne <HI>Don Phoebus</HI> is &s;aid to have dwelt in, in <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>

<P>Indeed I thought no fiction in Poetry had been able to have paralleld it: and made no doubt but it would have put me into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion as to have cryed out with the young Gallant in the Comedy, when he had &s;een his &s;weet-heart, <HI>Hei mihi qualis erat? talis erat qualem nunquam vidi;</HI> But I was much deceived in that hope, and could finde nothing in it to admire, much le&s;&s;e to envie. The Fable of the Mountaine which was with childe, and brought forth a mou&s;e; is que&s;tionle&s;&s;e a fable: this hou&s;e and the large fame it hath in the world, is the morall of it. Never was there an hou&s;e more un&s;utable to it &s;elf in the particular examination of parts, nor more un&s;utable to the character and e&s;teem of it in the generall Survey of the whole.</P>
<P>You enter into it over two draw bridges, and through three gates, ruinous enough, and abundantly un&s;ightly. In the Quadrangle you meet with three &s;everall fa&s;hions of building, of three &s;everall ages, and they &s;o unhappi|ly joyned one to the other, that one would half believe they had been clapped together by an earthquake. The South and We&s;t parts of it are new, and indeed Princelike; being the work of <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t, and his &s;on <HI>Henry.</HI> Had it been all ca&s;t into the &s;ame mould, I per&s;wade my &s;elf that it would be very gracious and lovely. The other two are of an ancient work, and &s;o contemprible, that they di&s;grace the re&s;t; and of the&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e the one fide

to be at the lea&s;t 100 years older then his partner: &s;uch is it without. As for the in&s;ide, it is far more gracefull, and would be plea&s;ing at the entrance, were the Guard|chamber reformed. Some <HI>Hugonot</HI> architect, which were not in love with the errours of Antiquity, might make a pretty room of it; a <HI>catholick</HI> Carpenter would never get credit by it: for whereas the provident thrift of our fore|fathers intended it (for the hou&s;e would el&s;e be too narrow for the Kings retinue) both for a room of &s;afety and of plea&s;ure, both for bill-men and dancers; and for that cau&s;e made up &s;ome &s;ix ranks of &s;eats on each &s;ide; that &s;paringne&s;&s;e in the more curious eyes of this time, is little Kinglike: Countrey wenches might with indifferent &s;tomach abu&s;e a good Galliard in it, or it might perhaps &s;erve with a &s;tage at one end to entertain the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> at a play, or with a partition in the middle, it might be di|vided into two prety plau&s;ible Cockpits; but to be em|ployed in the nature it now is, either to &s;olace the King and Lords in a dance, or to give any forain Amba&s;&s;ador his welcome in a Maske, is little &s;utable with the Maje&s;ty of a King of <HI>France.</HI> The Chambers of it are well built, but ill furni&s;hed; the hangings of them being &s;omewhat below a meanne&s;&s;e; and yet of the&s;e there is no &s;mall &s;carcity. For, as it is &s;aid of the <HI>Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> that <HI>Una Do|mus &amp; man&s;ioni &s;ufficit &amp; &s;epulturae:</HI> &s;o may we of this Prince, the &s;ame Chamber &s;erveth for to lodge him, to feed him, and al&s;o to confer and di&s;cour&s;e with his Nobility. But like enough it is that this want may proceed from the &s;everall Courts of the King, the <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> the Queen Mother and the Qeen Regoant, being all kept within it.</P>
<P>Proceed we now to the two Galleries, whereof the fir&s;t is that of the Queen Mother, as being beautified and ador|ned exceedingly by <HI>Katbarine de Medices,</HI> mother to <HI>Henry</HI> III. and <HI>Charles</HI> IX. It containeth the pictures of all the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and the mo&s;t loved of their Queens, &s;ince the time of St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> They &s;tand each King oppo&s;ite to his Queen, &s;he being that of his wives which either brought him mo&s;t e&s;tate, or his fucce&s;&s;ors. The tables are all of a ju&s;t length, very fair, and according to my little acquain|tance

with the Painter, of a mo&s;t excellent workman&s;hip, and which addeth much grace to it, they are in a manner a perfect Hi&s;tory of the State and Court of <HI>France</HI> in their &s;everall times. For under each of the Kings pictures, they have drawn the portraitures of mo&s;t of tho&s;e Lords whom valor and courage in the field enobled beyond their births. Under each of the Queens the lively &s;hapes of the mo&s;t prin|cipall Ladies, who&s;e beautie and virtue had honored the Court. A dainty invention, and happily expre&s;&s;ed. At the further end of it &s;tandeth the la&s;t King and the pre&s;ent Queen Mother; who fill up the whole room. The &s;ucceeding Princes, if they mean to live in their pictures, mu&s;t either build new places for them, or el&s;e make u&s;e of the long Gallery built by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and which openeth into that of the Queen Mother. A Gallery it is of an incredible length, as being above 500 yards long, and of a breadth and height not unporportionable; a room built rather for o&s;tentation then u&s;e, and &s;uch as hath more in it of the maje&s;ty of its founder then the grace. It was &s;aid to have been erected purpo&s;ely to joyn the <HI>Louure</HI> unto the Hou&s;e and Garden of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> an unlikely matter that &s;uch a &s;tupendious building &s;hould be de&s;igned only for a cleanly conveyance into a Summer hou&s;e: others are of an opinion that he had a re&s;olution to have made the hou&s;e quadrangular, every &s;ide being corre&s;pondent to this which &s;hould have been the common Gallery to the re&s;t. Which de&s;ign had it taken effect, this Palace would at once have been the wonder of the world, and the envy of it. For my part, I dare be of this la&s;t minde, as well becau&s;e the &s;econd &s;ide is in part begun, as al&s;o con&s;idering how infinitely this King was in|clined to building. The <HI>Place Daulphin,</HI> and the <HI>Place Royall,</HI> two of the fine&s;t piles in <HI>Paris,</HI> were erected partly by his pur&s;e, but principally by his encouragement. The new Bridge in <HI>Paris</HI> was meerly his work; &s;o was al&s;o the new Palace, and mo&s;t admirable waterworks of St. <HI>Germans en lay.</HI> This long Gallery and the new Pe&s;t hou&s;e oweth it &s;elf wholly to him; and the hou&s;e of <HI>Fountainebleau,</HI> which is the faire&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> is beholding to him for mo&s;t of its beauty; add to this his Fortifications be&s;towed on the <HI>Ba&s;tile;</HI>

his walling of <HI>Arles;</HI> and his purpo&s;e to have &s;trengthned <HI>Paris</HI> according to the modern art of Towns: and you will finde the attribute of <HI>Parietaria</HI> or wall flower, which <HI>Con|stantine</HI> &s;coffingly gave unto <HI>Trajan</HI> for his great humour of building, to be due unto this King; but &s;eriou&s;ly and with reverence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the generall love he had to building, he had al&s;o an ambition to go beyond example, which al&s;o induceth me fur|ther to believe his intent of making that large and admirable quadrangle above &s;poken of, to have been &s;erious and reall. For to omit others, certain it is, that he had a project of great &s;pirit and difficulty, which was to joyn the <HI>Mediterranean &s;ea</HI> and the <HI>Ocean</HI> together; and to make the Navigation from the one to the other through <HI>France,</HI> and not to pa&s;&s;e by the &s;traight of <HI>Gibraltare.</HI> It came into Councell, <HI>anno</HI> 1604, and was re&s;olved to be done by this means: The river <HI>Garond</HI> is Navigable from the <HI>Ocean</HI> almo&s;t to <HI>Tholoza;</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> openeth it &s;elf into the Land by a little River, who&s;e name I know not, as high as <HI>Narbonne.</HI> Betwixt the&s;e two places was there a Navigable channell to have been digged, and it proceeded &s;o far towards, being actuated, that a workman had undertaken it, and the price was agreed upon. But there ari&s;ing &s;ome di&s;contents be|tween the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> about the building of the Fort <HI>Fluentes</HI> in the Countrey of the <HI>Gri&s;ons;</HI> the King not knowing what u&s;e he might have of Trea&s;ure in that quar|rell, commanded the work not to go forward. However he is to be commended in the attempt, which was indeed Kinglike, and worthy his &s;pirit: prai&s;e him in his heroick purpo&s;e and de&s;igne.

<P>HAving abundantly &s;tifled our &s;pirits in the &s;tink of <HI>Paris,</HI> on Tue&s;day being the 12 of <HI>July,</HI> we took our leave of it, and prepared our &s;elves to enter|tain the &s;weet Air and Wine of <HI>Orleans.</HI> The day fair and

not &s;o much as di&s;po&s;ed to a cloud, &s;ave that they began to gather together about noon, in the nature of a curtain to defend us from the injury of the Sun. The wind rather &s;ufficient to fan the air, then to di&s;turb it, by qualifying the heat of the Cele&s;tial fire, brought the air to an excellent mediocrity of temper: you would have thought it a day meerly framed for the great Prince&s;&s;e Nature to take her plea&s;ure in, and that the birds which cheerfully gave us their voices from the neighbouring bu&s;hes, had been the loud mu&s;ick of her Court. In a word, it was a day &s;olely con&s;ecrated to a plea&s;ant journey, and he that did not put it to that u&s;e, mi&s;-&s;pent it: having therefore put our &s;elves into our wagon, we took a &s;hort farewell of <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> exceeding joyfull that we yet lived to &s;ee the beauty of the fields again, and enjoy the happine&s;&s;e of a free heaven. The Countrey &s;uch as that part of the I&s;le of <HI>France</HI> to|wards <HI>Normandy;</HI> only that the corn grounds were larger, and more even. On the left hand of us we had a &s;ide-glance of the royall hou&s;e of <HI>Boys</HI> St. <HI>Vincennes,</HI> and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bi&s;e&s;tre;</HI> and about &s;ome two miles beyond them we had a &s;ight al&s;o of a new hou&s;e lately built by Mr. <HI>Sillery</HI> Chan|cellor of the Kingdome, a pretty hou&s;e it promi&s;ed to be, having two ba&s;e Courts on the hither &s;ide of it, and beyond it a park; an ornament whereof many great man&s;ions in <HI>France</HI> are altogether ignorant.</P>
<P>Four leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> is the the Town of <HI>Montliberrie,</HI> now old and ruinous: and hath nothing in it to commend it, but the carka&s;&s;e of a Ca&s;tle: without it, it hath to brag of a large and &s;pacious plain; on which was fought that me|morable battail between <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11. and <HI>Charles le hardie,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgogne,</HI> a battail memorable only for the running away of each Army: the field being in a manner emptied of all the forces, and yet neither of the Princes victorious. <HI>Hic &s;pe celer, ille &s;alute,</HI> &s;ome ran out of fear to die, and &s;ome out of hope to live: that it was hard to &s;ay, which of the Souldiers made mo&s;t u&s;e of their heels in the combat. This notwith&s;tanding, the King e&s;teemed him&s;elf the conquerour, not that he overcame, but becau&s;e not vanqui&s;ht. He was a Prince of no heart to make a warriour, and therefore re|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="123" REF="86">
was to him almo&s;t hugged as victory. It was <HI>An|tonies</HI> ca&s;e in his war again&s;t the <HI>Parthians:</HI> a Captain who&s;e Launce King <HI>Lewis</HI> was not worthy to bear after him. <HI>Cra&s;&s;us</HI> before him had been taken by that people: but <HI>An|tonius</HI> made a retreat, though with lo&s;&s;e, <HI>Hanc ita&abque; fugam &s;uam, quia vivus exierat, victoriam vocabat;</HI> as <HI>Paterculus,</HI> one that loved him not, &s;aith of him. Yet was King <HI>Lewis</HI> is &s;o puffed up with this conceit of victory, that he ever after &s;lighted his enemies: and at la&s;t ruined them, and their cau&s;e with them. The war which they undertook again&s;t him, they had entituled the war of the Weal publick: becau&s;e the occa&s;ion of their taking armes was for the liberty of their Countrey and people: both whom the King had be|yond mea&s;ure oppre&s;&s;ed. True it is, they had al&s;o their particular purpo&s;es; but this was the main, and failing in the expected event of it, all that they did, was to confirm the bondage of the Realm, by their own overthrow. The&s;e Princes once disbanded, and &s;everally broken; none dur&s;t ever afterwards enter into the action; for which rea&s;on King <HI>Lewis</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay that he had brought the Kings of <HI>France, Hors pupillage,</HI> out of their ward-&s;hip: a &s;peech of more brag then truth. The people I confe&s;&s;e, he brought into &s;uch terms of &s;lavery; that they no longer merited the name of &s;ubjects, but yet for all his great boa&s;t, the No|bles of <HI>France</HI> are to this day the Kings Guardians. I have already &s;hewn you much of their potency. By that you may &s;ee that the <HI>French</HI> Kings have not yet &s;ued their li|very, as our Lawyers call it. Had he al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure broken the powerablene&s;s of the Princes, he had then been perfectly his words-ma&s;ter; and till that be done, I &s;hall &s;till think his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to be in their pupillage. That King is but half him&s;elf which hath the ab&s;olute command only of half his people.</P>
<P>The battail foughten by this Town, the common peo|ple impute to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and &s;o do they al&s;o many others which they had no hand in. For hearing their Grandames talk of their wars with our nation, and of their many fields which we gained of them; they no &s;ooner hear of a pitched field; but pre&s;ently, (as the nature of men in a fright
<PB N="124" REF="87">
is) they attribute it to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> good &s;imple &s;ouls, <HI>Qui nos non &s;olum laudibus no&s;tris ornare velint, &s;ed onerare alienis,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> in his Philippicks. An humour ju&s;t like unto that of little children, who being once frighted with the tales of <HI>Robin Goodfellow,</HI> do never after hear any noi&s;e in the night, but they &s;traight imagine, that it is he which maketh it; or like the women of the villages neer <HI>Oxford,</HI> who having heard the tragicall &s;tory of a duck or an hen killed, and car|ried to the Univer&s;ity: no &s;ooner mi&s;&s;e one of their chickens, but in&s;tantly they cry out upon the Scholars. On the &s;ame fal&s;e ground al&s;o, hearing that the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> while&s;t they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this Countrey, were great builders; they be&s;tow on them without any more adoe, the foundation and perfecting of mo&s;t of the Churches and Ca&s;tles in the Countrey. Thus are our Ance&s;tors &s;aid to have built the Churches of <HI>Roven, Amiens, Bayon, &amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Bois,</HI> St. <HI>Vincennes,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;tile;</HI> the two little forts on the river &s;ide by the <HI>Louure:</HI> that of St. <HI>Germans;</HI> and among&s;t many others, this of <HI>Mont l'Hierrie,</HI> where we now are; and all alike: as for this Ca&s;tle, it was built during the reign of K. <HI>Robert, anno</HI> 1015. by one of his &s;ervants, named <HI>Thi|bald:</HI> long before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this Con|tinent. It was razed by <HI>Lewis</HI> the Gro&s;&s;e, as being a har|bourer of rebels in former times; and by that means, as a &s;trong bridle in the mouth of <HI>Paris:</HI> nothing now &s;tanding of it, &s;ave an high Tower, which is &s;een a great di&s;tance round about, and &s;erveth for a land mark.</P>
<P>Two leagues from <HI>Mont l'Hierrie</HI> is the Town of <HI>Ca&s;tres;</HI> &s;eated in the farthe&s;t angle of <HI>France,</HI> where it confineth to <HI>La Beau&s;e.</HI> A Town of an ordinary &s;ize, &s;omewhat bigger then for a Market, and le&s;&s;e then would be&s;eem a City, a wall it hath, and a ditch; but neither &s;erviceable further then to re&s;i&s;t the enemy at one gate, while&s;t the people run away by the other: nothing el&s;e remarkable in it, but the habit of the Church, which was mourning: for &s;uch is the fa&s;hion of <HI>France,</HI> that when any of the Nobles are buried, the Church which en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ombeth them is painted black within and with|out, for the breadth of a yard, or thereabouts; and their Coats of Armes drawn on it. To go to the charges of

hanging it round with cloth is not for their profits: be|&s;ides, this counterfeit &s;orrow feareth no theef; and dareth out-brave a tempe&s;t: he for whom the Church of <HI>Ca&s;tres</HI> was thus apparelled, had been Lord of the Town: by name, as I remember, Mr. St. <HI>Benoi&s;t;</HI> his Armes were Argent, three Cre&s;&s;ants, Or, a Mullet of the &s;ame; but whether this Mul|let were part of the Coat, or a mark only of difference, I could not learn.

<P><HI>La Beau&s;e</HI> hath on the North, <HI>Normandie;</HI> on the Ea&s;t the I&s;le of <HI>France;</HI> on the South, <HI>Nivernois</HI> and <HI>Berry;</HI> and on the We&s;t the Countreys of <HI>Toureine</HI> and <HI>Lemaine.</HI> It lyeth in the 22 and 23 degree of Longitude; and 48 and 49 of Lati|tude: taking wholly up the breadth of the two former, and but parts only of each of the later; if you mea&s;ure it with the be&s;t advantage for length, you will finde it to extend from <HI>la ferte Bernard</HI> in the North-we&s;t corner of it, to <HI>Gyan,</HI> in the South ea&s;t; which according to the proportion of degrees, amounteth to 60 miles <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;omewhat bet|ter: for breadth, it is much after the &s;ame reckoning. The antient inhabitants of this Province, and the rea&s;on of the name I could not learn among&s;t the people: neither can I finde any certainty of it in my books with whom I have con&s;ulted. If I may be bold to go by conjecture, I &s;hould think this Countrey to have been the &s;eat of the <HI>Bel|loca&s;&s;t,</HI> a people of <HI>Gaule Celtick</HI> mentioned by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his Commentaries. Certain it is, that in or neer this tract they were &s;eated; and in likelihood in this Province: the names ancient and modern, being not much different in &s;en&s;e, though in &s;ound; for the <HI>Francks</HI> called that (which in La|tine is <HI>Pulcher,</HI> or <HI>Bellus)</HI> by the name of <HI>Bel,</HI> in the Ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">u|culine Gender, <HI>(Ben</HI> they pronounce it) and <HI>Beau</HI> if it were Feminine; &s;o that the name of <HI>Bello ca&s;&s;i,</HI> is but varied into that of <HI>Beau&s;e;</HI> be&s;ides, that Province which the <HI>Roman</HI> writers &s;tile <HI>Bellovaci,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> now call <HI>Beauvais;</HI> where

<HI>Bello</HI> isal&s;o turned into <HI>Beau.</HI> Add to this that the <HI>Latine</HI> writers do term this Countrey <HI>Bel&s;ia;</HI> where the antient <HI>Bello</HI> is &s;till pre&s;erv'd; and my conjecture may be pardoned, if not approved. As for tho&s;e which have removed this people into <HI>Normandie;</HI> and found them in the City of <HI>Baieux:</HI> I appeal to any under&s;tanding man, whether their peremptory &s;entence, or my &s;ubmi&s;&s;e opinion, be the more allowable.

<P>The &s;ame night, we came to <HI>Estampes,</HI> a Town &s;ituate in a very plentiful and fruitful &s;oyl; and watred with a river of the &s;ame name, &s;tored with the be&s;t crevices. It &s;eemeth to have been a town of principall importance; there being five wals and gates in a length, one before another: &s;o that it appeareth to be rather a continuation of many towns to|gether, then &s;imply one. The &s;treets are of a large breadth; the building for &s;ub&s;tance are &s;tone; and for fa&s;hion as the re&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> It containeth in it five Churches, whereof the principal, which is a Colledge of <HI>Chanoins,</HI> is that of <HI>No&s;tre dame;</HI> built by King <HI>Robert:</HI> who is &s;aid al&s;o to have foun|ded the Ca&s;tle; which now can &s;car&s;ely be vi&s;ited in its ruines. Without the town, they have a fine green medow, daintily &s;eated within the circlings of the water; into which they u&s;e to follow their recreations. At my being there, the &s;port was dancing; an exerci&s;e much u&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> who do naturally affect it. And it &s;eemeth this natural inclination, is &s;o &s;trong and deep rooted; that neither age nor the ab&s;ence of a &s;miling fortune can prevail again&s;t it. For on this dancing green, there a&s;&s;embled not only youth and Gentry, but age al&s;o and beggery. Old wives which could not put foot to ground without a Crutch, in the &s;treets; had here taught their feet to hoble; you would have thought by the cleanly conveyance of their bodies that they had been troubled with the <HI>Sciatica:</HI> and yet &s;o eager in the &s;port, as if their dancing daies &s;hould never be done. Some there were &s;o ragged, that a &s;wift Galliard would almo&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="88">
have &s;haked them into nakedne&s;s: and they al&s;o mo&s;t vio|lent to have their carka&s;&s;es directed in a mea&s;ure. To have attempted the &s;taying of them at home, or the per&s;wading of them to work, when they had heard the Fiddle, had been a task too unwieldy for <HI>Hercules.</HI> In this mixture of age and condition, did we ob&s;erve them at their pa&s;time; the rags being &s;o interwoven with the &s;ilke, and wrinkled browes &s;o interchangeably mingled with fre&s;h beauties: that you would have thought it, to have been a mummery of for|tune. As for tho&s;e of both &s;exes, which were altogether pa&s;t action; they had cau&s;ed them&s;elves to be carried thi|ther in their chairs, and trod the mea&s;ure with their eyes! The Inne which we lay in was ju&s;t like tho&s;e of <HI>Normandy;</HI> or at the lea&s;t &s;o like as was fit for &s;i&s;ters; for &s;uch you mu&s;t think them.

<P>All the difference between them lay in the morning: and among&s;t the maid-&s;ervants. For here we were not troubled with &s;uch an importunate begging as in that other Coun|trey. The&s;e here had learned a more neat and compendious way of getting money; and petitioned not our ears, but our no&s;es. By the rhetorick of a po&s;ie, they prevailed up|on the pur&s;e; and by giving each of us a bundle of dead flowers tacked together, &s;eemed rather to buy our boun|ties, then to beg them. A &s;weeter and more generous kinde of Petitioning then the other of <HI>Normandie;</HI> and &s;uch as may &s;eem to employ in it &s;ome happy contradiction. For what el&s;e is it, that a maid &s;hould proffer her &s;elf to be deflowred without prejudice to her mode&s;ty: and rai&s;e to her future husband an hone&s;t &s;tock, by the u&s;ury of a kindne&s;s? Refre&s;hed with the&s;e favours, we took our leave of <HI>E&s;tampes,</HI> and the dancing mi&s;cellany: jogging on through many a beautifull field of corn, till we came unto <HI>Augerville</HI> which is &s;ix leagues di&s;tant. A Town of which I could not ob&s;erve, nor hear of any thing memorable; but that is was taken by <HI>Montacute</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury;</HI> as he went this
<PB N="128" REF="89">
way to the &s;iege of <HI>Orleans;</HI> and indeed, the taking of it was no great miracle, the wals being &s;o thin, that an arrow would almo&s;t as &s;oon make a breach in them as a Canon. The &s;ame fortune befell al&s;o unto <HI>Toury,</HI> a place not much be|yond it in &s;trength or bigne&s;s: only that it had more con|fidence (as <HI>Savage</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman once &s;aid) in the wals of bones, which were within it, then in the wals of &s;tones which were without it.&mdash;This Town &s;tandeth in the middle way betwixt <HI>F&s;tampes</HI> and <HI>Orleans:</HI> and there|fore a fit &s;tage to act a dinner on; and to it we went. By that time we had cleared our &s;elves of our pottage, there en|tred upon us three uncouth fellowes, with hats on their heads like covered di&s;hes. As &s;oon as ever I &s;aw them, I ca&s;t one eye on my cloak, and the other on my &s;word: as not knowing what u&s;e I might have of my &s;teel, to maintain my cloth. There was great talk at that time of Mr. <HI>Soubi&s;es</HI> be|ing in armes: and I much feared that the&s;e might be &s;ome &s;traglers of his Army: and this I &s;u&s;pected by their coun|tenances, which were very theevi&s;h and full of in&s;olences. But when I had made a &s;urvey of their apparel, I quickly altered that opinion; and accounted them as the excrement of the next pri&s;on: deceived alike in both my jealou&s;ies; for the&s;e pretty parcels of mans fle&s;h, were neither better nor wor&s;e, but even arrant fidlers: and &s;uch which in <HI>England</HI> we &s;hould not hold worthy of the whipping-po&s;t. Our leave not asked, and no reverence on their parts performed, they abu&s;ed our ears with an har&s;h le&s;&s;on: and as if that had not been puni&s;hment enough unto us, they mu&s;t needs add to it one of their &s;ongs. By that little <HI>French</HI> which I had gathered, and the &s;impring of a <HI>fille de joy</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> who came along with us; I perceived it was bawdy; and to &s;ay the truth, more then could be patiently endured by any but a <HI>French</HI> man. But <HI>quid facerem,</HI> what &s;hould I do but endure the mi&s;ery? for I had not language enough to call them Rogues hand&s;omely; and the villains were inferiour to a beating: and indeed not worthy of mine or any hone&s;t mans anger.

They were a knot of ra&s;cals &s;o infinitely below the &s;everity of a &s;tatute, that they would have di&s;credited the &s;tocks; and to have hang'd them, had been to hazard the reputati|on of the gallowes.

<P>Among the Ancients I have met with three kindes of Mu|&s;ick, <HI>viz.</HI> fir&s;t that which the Greeks call <GAP DESC="foreign">, which con&s;i&s;teth altogether of long notes, or <HI>&s;pondaeus.</HI> This was the grave&s;t and &s;adde&s;t of the re&s;t; called by <HI>Aristotle</HI> in the la&s;t chapter of his Politicks, <GAP DESC="foreign">, or morall; becau&s;e it &s;et|led the affections. <HI>Boetius</HI> whom we account the Cla&s;&s;ical author in this faculty, calleth it <HI>Lydian,</HI> becau&s;e in much u&s;e with tho&s;e of that Nation, at this day we may call it <HI>Italian,</HI> as being generally a peculiar mu&s;ick to that peo|ple. This is the mu&s;ick which <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> called for, to invite unto him the &s;pirit of Prophe&s;ie, 1 King. 3. 15. and this is it which is yet &s;ung in our Churches. A practice which we derive from the ancients, however &s;ome of late have oppo&s;ed it: and which is much commended by S. <HI>Au&s;tin;</HI> this being the u&s;e of it; <HI>Ut per oblectamenta aurium, infirmior animus in pietatis affectum a&s;&s;urgat.</HI> The &s;econd kinde the arti&s;ts call <GAP DESC="foreign">, which con&s;i&s;teth of a mixture of long and and &s;hort notes, or of the <HI>Dactylus.</HI> The philo&s;opher termeth it <GAP DESC="foreign"> or active, becau&s;e it rai&s;ed up the affections. <HI>Boetius</HI> termeth it the <HI>Dorian,</HI> becau&s;e it had been in much e&s;teem among&s;t the <HI>Dores</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> nation: we may now call it <HI>Eng|li&s;h;</HI> and is that mu&s;ick which cheereth the &s;pirits, and is &s;o &s;overaign an antidote to a minde afflicted; and
<PB N="130" REF="90">
which as the Poet hath it, doth <HI>&s;axa movere &s;ono.</HI> The third &s;ort is that which the Greeks call <GAP DESC="foreign">, con&s;i&s;ting alto|gether of &s;hort notes, or <HI>Tribrachys. Ari&s;totle</HI> calleth it <GAP DESC="foreign">, or ravi&s;hing; becau&s;e it unhinged the affections, and &s;tirred them to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;&s;e. <HI>Boetius</HI> termeth it <HI>Phry|gian,</HI> as being the &s;train of the wanton and luxuriant peo|ple. In the&s;e times we may call it <HI>French,</HI> as mo&s;t delighted in, by the &s;tirring &s;pirits, and lightne&s;s of this nation. A note of mu&s;ick forbidden unto youth by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Plato;</HI> and not countenanced by any of them but on the com|mon theatres, to &s;atisfie the rude manners and de&s;ires of the vulgar; <GAP DESC="foreign">, and to give them al&s;o content in their recreations: yet is this mu&s;ick altogether in u&s;e in this Countrey, no le&s;&s;on among&s;t their prote&s;t Mu&s;itians that I could hear, which had any gravity or &s;olid art &s;hewed in the compo&s;ition.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WEE are now come into the Countrey of <HI>Orleans,</HI> which though within the limits of <HI>La Beau&s;e,</HI> will not yet be an entire County of it &s;elf. It is a dainty and plea&s;ing Region, very even and large in the fields of it, in&s;omuch that we could not &s;ee an hill, or &s;wel|ling of the ground within eye-&s;ight. It con&s;i&s;teth in an in|different mea&s;ure of Corn, but mo&s;t plentifully of Vines; and hath of all other fruits a very liberall portion; neither is it meanly beholding to the <HI>Loyre,</HI> for the benefits it re|ceiveth by that river: on which the City of <HI>Orleans</HI> it &s;elf is &s;weetly &s;eated. Of all places in <HI>England, Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> in mine opinion, cometh mo&s;t nigh it; as well in re&s;pect of the Countrey, as the &s;ituation of the Town. For certainly that Countrey may be called the Epitome of <HI>England;</HI> as this of <HI>France.</HI> To the riche&s;t of the corn-fields of <HI>Orleanoys</HI> we may compare the Vale of <HI>Eve&s;ham:</HI> neither will it yeeld for the choile and variety of fruits, the Vine only excepted. The hedges in that Countrey are prodigall and lavi&s;h of tho&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="91">
trees which would become the faire&s;t Orchards of the re&s;t; and in a manner recompen&s;eth the want of Wine, by its pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n|ty of Perry and Sider.

Both &s;eated on the &s;econd river of note in their &s;everal Countreys; and which are not much unlike in their &s;everal cour&s;es. <HI>Severne</HI> wa&s;hing the wals of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing nigh unto <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;eated on a little riveret and its homager, divideth the Antients <HI>Britains</HI> from the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The <HI>Loyre,</HI> gliding by the City of <HI>Tours,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing nigh to <HI>Augeire,</HI> &s;eated al&s;o up the land, on a little river, and one of its tri|butories, &s;eparateth the modern <HI>Bretagnes</HI> from the re&s;t of the <HI>French.

<P>The people of this town are not of the fewe&s;t: no Town in <HI>France,</HI> the capacity of it con&s;idered, being more popu|lous; for &s;tanding in &s;o delicate an air, and on &s;o commo|dious a river, it inviteth the Gentry or Nobles of the Coun|trey about it, to inhabit there: and they accept it. Concer|ning their behaviour and humanity, certainly they much ex|ceed the <HI>Pari&s;ians.</HI> I was about to &s;ay all the <HI>French</HI> men; and indeed, I need not grudge them that Elogie which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> giveth unto tho&s;e of <HI>Kent:</HI> and verifie, that they are <HI>omnium incolarum longe bumani&s;&s;imi;</HI> my &s;elf here ob&s;erving more courtefie and affability in one day, then I could meet withall in <HI>Paris,</HI> during all my abode.

Pari&s;h Churches it hath in it 26 of different and unequall being: as it u&s;eth to be in other places. Be&s;ides the&s;e, it contains the Epi&s;copal
<PB N="133" REF="91">
Church of St. <HI>Croix,</HI> and divers other hou&s;es of religious per&s;ons; among&s;t which Sr. <HI>Jacques:</HI> of both which I &s;hall &s;peak in their due order. Thus much for the re&s;emblance of the Towns: the difference betwixt them is this. That <HI>Orleans</HI> is the bigger, and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> the richer; <HI>Orleans</HI> con|&s;i&s;teth much of the Nobles, and of &s;ojourners; <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> of Citizens only, and home dwellers. And for the manner of life in them; &s;o it is, that <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> hath the hand&s;omer women in it; <HI>Orleans</HI> the finer (and in mine opinion the lovelie&s;t of all <HI>France:) Worce&s;ter</HI> thriveth much on Clothing; <HI>Orleans</HI> on their Vine-pre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>And que&s;tionle&s;s the Vine of <HI>Orleans</HI> is the greate&s;t riches not of the Town only, but of the Countrey al&s;o about it. For this cau&s;e <HI>Andre du Che&s;ne</HI> calleth it the prime cellar of <HI>Paris.

I have heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentleman, who being in <HI>Italy,</HI> was brought acquainted with a kinde of Wine, which they there call <HI>Lachrymae Christi.</HI> No &s;ooner had he ta&s;ted it, but he fell into a deep melancholy: and after &s;ome &s;even &s;ighs, be&s;ides the additi|on of two grones, he brake out into this pathetical ejacu|lation: <HI>Dii boni, quare non Christus lachrymatus e&s;&s;et in no&s;tris regionibus!</HI> This <HI>Dutch</HI> man and I, were for a time of one minde: in&s;omuch that I could almo&s;t have picked a quar|rell with nature, for giving us none of this liquor in <HI>Eng|land:</HI> at la&s;t we grew friends again, when I had perceived how offen&s;ive it was to the brain, (if not well qualified) for which cau&s;e it is &s;aid, that King <HI>Lewis</HI> hath bani&s;hed it his Cellar: no doubt to the great grief of his drinking Courtiers, who may therefore &s;ay with <HI>Martiall,</HI>

This Town called <HI>Genabum</HI> by <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> was reedified by <HI>Au|relian</HI> the Emperour, <HI>anno</HI> 276. and called by his name <HI>Au|relianum;</HI> which it &s;till retaineth among&s;t the <HI>Latines.</HI> It hath been famous heretofore for four Councels here cele|brated; and for being the &s;iege royal of the Kings of <HI>Orleans,</HI> though as now I could not hear any thing of the ruines of the Palace. The fame of it at this time con&s;i&s;teth in the Univer&s;ity, and its &s;eat of ju&s;tice: this Town being one of them which they call <HI>Seiges pre&s;idiaux.</HI> Now the&s;e <HI>Seiges Pre&s;idiaux,</HI> Seats or Courts of Ju&s;tice were e&s;tabli&s;hed in di|ver&s;e Cities of the Realm, for the ea&s;e of the people; <HI>anno</HI> 1551, or thereabouts. In them all civil cau&s;es not excee|ding 250 livres in money, or 10 livres in rents; are heard and determined &s;overaignly and without appeal. If the &s;um exceed tho&s;e proportions, the appeal holdeth good, and &s;hall be examined in that Court of Parliament under who&s;e juri&s;diction they are. This Court here con&s;i&s;teth of a Bailly who&s;e name is Mr. <HI>Digion,</HI> of 12 Coun&s;ellors, two Lieu|tenants, one civil and the other criminal; and a publick no|tary. When Mr. <HI>Le Comte de</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who is Governor or Lieutenant Generall of the Province, cometh into their Court, he giveth precedency to the Bailly: in other places he receiveth it. This in&s;titution of the&s;e Pre&s;identiall Courts, was at fir&s;t a very profitable ordinance, and much ea&s;ed the people: but now it is grown burthen&s;ome: the rea&s;on is, that the offices are made &s;alable, and purcha&s;ed by them with a great deal of money, which afterwards they wre&s;t again out of the pur&s;es of the pe&s;ants: the &s;ale of offices drawing nece&s;&s;arily after it, the &s;ale of ju&s;tice; a mi&s;|chief which is &s;pread &s;o far, that there is not the poore&s;t under-officer in all the Realm, who may not &s;afely &s;ay with the Captain in the 22. of the <HI>Acts</HI> and the 28. ver&s;. <GAP DESC="foreign">, with a great &s;um of mo|ney obtained I this freedome. Twenty years purcha&s;e is &s;aid to be no extraordinary rate: and I have read, that only by the &s;ale of offices, one of the Kings had rai&s;ed in 20 years 139 millions: which amounteth to the proportion of &s;even millions yearly, or thereabouts: of all waies to thrift and trea&s;ure the mo&s;t unkingly. In the year 1614 the King
<PB N="135" REF="92">
motioned the aboli&s;ing of the &s;ales of this market, but it was upon a condition more prejudicial to the people then the mi&s;chief: for he de&s;ired in lieu of it, to have a grea|ter impo&s;ition laid upon Salt and on the Aides: which tho&s;e who were Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Commonalty would not admit of; becau&s;e then a common mi&s;ery had been bought out of the State to make their particular mi&s;ery the greater, and &s;o the corruption remaineth unaltered.</P>
<P>This Town, as it is &s;weetly &s;eated in re&s;pect of the air: &s;o is it finely convenienced with walks: of which the chief are that next unto <HI>Paris</HI> Gate, having the wall on one hand, and a rank of palm-trees on the other; the &s;econd that near unto the Bridge, having the water plea&s;ingly running on both &s;ides: and a third, which is indeed the principal, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the City. It is called the <HI>Palle Malle,</HI> from an exerci&s;e of that name, much u&s;ed in this Kingdome: a very Gentleman-like &s;port, not over violent; and &s;uch as affordeth good opportunity of di&s;cour&s;e, as they walk from one mark to the other. Into this walk, which is of a wonderful length and beauty, you &s;hall have a clear evening empty all the Town: the aged people borrowing legs to carry them; and the younger, armes to guide them. If any young Dame or Mon&s;ieur, walk thither &s;ingle, they will quickly finde &s;ome or other to link with them: though per|haps &s;uch with whom they have no familiarity. Thus do they mea&s;ure and re-mea&s;ure the length of the <HI>Palle Malle,</HI> not minding the &s;hutting in of the day, till darkne&s;s hath taken away the &s;en&s;e of blu&s;hing. At all hours of the night, be it warm and dry, you &s;hall be &s;ure to finde them there, thus coupled: and if at the years end, there be found more chil|dren then fathers in the Town; this walk and the night are &s;u&s;pected &s;hrewdly to be acce&s;&s;aries. A greater incon|venience in my opinion then an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ki&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>There is yet a fourth walk in this Town called <HI>L' E&s;tapp,</HI> a walk principally frequented by Merchants: who here meet to con&s;erre of their occa&s;ions. It lyeth before the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Le Comte de St. Paul</HI> the Governour, and reacheth up to the Cloy&s;ter of St. <HI>Croix:</HI> of the building of which Church, I could never yet hear or read of any thing, but that which
<PB N="136" REF="93">
is meerly fabulous, for the Citizens report, that long &s;ince, time out of minde, there appeared a vi&s;ion to an holy Monk, which lived thereabouts, and bad him dig deep in &s;uch a place, where he &s;hould finde a piece of the holy Cro&s;&s;e, charging him to pre&s;erve that ble&s;&s;ed relique in great ho|nour, and to cau&s;e a Church to be built in that place where it had been buried: upon this warning the Church was founded, but at who&s;e charges they could not enform me: &s;o that all which I could learn concerning the foundation of this Church, is that it was erected only by Super&s;tition and a lie. The Super&s;tition is apparent in their wor&s;hipping of &s;uch rotten &s;ticks, as they imagine to be remnants of the Cro&s;&s;e; their calling of it holy, and dedicating of this Church unto it. Nay they have con&s;ecrated unto it two holy daies, one in <HI>May,</HI> and the other in <HI>September:</HI> and are bound to &s;alute it as often as they &s;ee it in the &s;treets or the high-waies, with the&s;e words, <HI>Ave &s;alus totius &s;aeculi arbor &s;a|lutifera.</HI> Horrible bla&s;phemy, and never heard but under Antichri&s;t! <HI>Cruces &s;ubeundas e&s;&s;e non adorandas,</HI> being the le&s;|&s;on of the Ancients. As for the miracle, I account it as others of the &s;ame &s;tamp: equally fal&s;e and ridiculous. This Church in the year 1562. was defaced and ruined by the <HI>Hu|gonots,</HI> who had entred the Town under the conduct of the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> An action little &s;avouring of humanity, and le&s;&s;e of Religion: the very Heathens them&s;elves ne|ver demoli&s;hing any of the Churches, of tho&s;e Towns which they had taken. But in this action, the <HI>Hugonots</HI> con&s;ulted only with ra&s;hne&s;&s;e, and a zealous fury, think|ing no title &s;o glorious as to be called the Scourge of Papi&s;ts, and the overthrowers of Popi&s;h Churches.
<Q><L>Quid facerent ho&s;tes capla crudelius urbe?</L></Q></P>
<P>The mo&s;t barbarous enemy in the world could not more have exerci&s;ed their malice on the vanqui&s;hed; and this I per&s;wade my &s;elf had been the fate of mo&s;t of our Churches, if that faction had got the upper hand of us.

What &s;hould move the <HI>Hugonots</HI> to this execution, I cannot &s;ay: unle&s;&s;e it were a hate which they bare unto the name; and perhaps that not unlikely. We read how the <HI>Romans</HI> having expelled their Kings, bani&s;hed al&s;o <HI>Col|latinus</HI> their Con&s;ul: a man in whom they could finde no fault but this, that his &s;urname was <HI>Tarquin; tantum ob nomen &amp; genus regium,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Florus:</HI> afterwards, <HI>quam invi&s;um regis nomen,</HI> is very frequent in the &s;tories of tho&s;e times. Among&s;t tho&s;e which had been of the con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Ju|lius Cae&s;ar,</HI> there was one named <HI>Cinna,</HI> a name &s;o odious among&s;t the people, that meeting by chance with one of <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI>'s chief friends, and hearing that his name was <HI>Cinna,</HI> they pre&s;ently murthered him in the place, for which cau&s;e one <HI>Ca&s;ca,</HI> which was al&s;o the name of one of the Con&s;pi|rators, publi&s;hed a writing of his name and pedegree: &s;hew|ing therein, that he neither was the traytor, nor any kin to him. The rea&s;on of his action <HI>Dion</HI> giveth us <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Quod Cinua nominis cau&s;a occideretur.</HI> With a like hate it may be were the <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t the name of the Cro&s;&s;e: for they not only ruined this temple but beat down al&s;o all tho&s;e little cro&s;&s;ets, betwixt <HI>Mont Martre,</HI> and St. <HI>Denis,</HI> though now King <HI>Lewis</HI> hath cau&s;ed them to be re-edified. And what troubles the <HI>French</HI> party here in <HI>England</HI> have rai&s;ed, becau&s;e of that harmle&s;&s;e ceremony of the cro&s;&s;e; <HI>Notius e&s;t quam ut &s;tilo egeat,</HI> and therefore I omit it. This Church is the &s;eat of a Bi&s;hop, who acknowledgeth the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Sens,</HI> for his Metropolitan. The pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop is named <HI>Franci&s;cus d' Aube&s;pine,</HI> &s;aid to be a worthy Scholar, and a &s;ound Po|lititian; though he were never graduated further then the arts. Of his revenue I could learn nothing, but of his pri|viledge this: namely, that at the fir&s;t entrance of every new Bi&s;hop into this Church, he hath the liberty of &s;etting free any of the pri&s;oners of the Gaole: though their crime be never &s;o mortall. For, the original of this indulgence: we are beholding to St. <HI>Aignan,</HI> once Bi&s;hop here, and who defen|ded the City again&s;t <HI>Auila</HI> the <HI>Harme.</HI> At his fir&s;t en|trance
<PB N="138" REF="94">
into the town, (&s;aith the &s;tory) after he was inve|&s;ted Bi&s;hop, he be&s;ought <HI>Agrippinus</HI> the Governour, that for his &s;ake he would let loo&s;e all his pri&s;oners, <HI>ut omnes quos pro variis criminibus poenalis carcer detinebat inclu&s;os, in &s;ui introi|tus gratiam redderet ab&s;olutos;</HI> when the Governour had heard his reque&s;t, he denied it: and pre&s;ently a &s;tone falleth upon his head, no man knew from whence: wounded and ter|rified with this, the Governor granteth his de&s;ire, recover|eth her health: and ever &s;ince the cu&s;tome hath continued. For the truth of this &s;tory, I intend to be no Champion: for I hold it ridiculous and &s;avouring too much of the Le|gend: but this I am certain of, that every new Bi&s;hop ma|keth a very &s;olemn and maje&s;tick entry into the City; and at his entry, relea&s;eth a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Let us follow the Bi&s;hop into his Church, and there we &s;hall finde him entertained with an high Ma&s;&s;e; the cere|monies whereof are very pretty and ab&s;urd. To go over them all, would require a volume, I will therefore mention tho&s;e only wherein they differ from other Ma&s;&s;es: and they are two: the one fanta&s;tical, the other heatheni&s;h. For as &s;oon as the prie&s;t at the altar hath read a certain le&s;&s;on, but what, his voice was not audible enough to tell me: out marcheth the Dean, or in his ab&s;ence, the &s;enior Canon, out of the Church. Before him two or three torches, and a long cro&s;&s;e &s;ilvered over, after him all tho&s;e of the Church, and la&s;tly the lay people, both men and women: &s;o that there is none left to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but the Prie&s;t and the Altar; and &s;uch &s;trangers as come thither for curio&s;ity, they go out at one door, and having fir&s;t circuited the quire, and afterwards the body of the Church; they return to their places: and the Prie&s;t proceedeth. I have &s;een many a dumb &s;hew in a play ju&s;t like it. This only is the difference, that here we had no interpreter nor Chorus afforded us to &s;hew us the my&s;terie of this &s;ilent ge&s;ticulation. The other addition which I ob&s;erved here at the Ma&s;&s;e (though I have &s;ince been told that it is ordinary at high Ma&s;&s;es, in the Cathedral Churches) was the cen&s;ing of the people: which was per|formed in this manner. While&s;t the Prie&s;t was bu&s;ie at the Altar, there entred into the quire at a &s;ide door, two boyes in
<PB N="139" REF="94">
their Surplices, bearing wax-tapers in their hands: and immediately after them the fore&s;aid fellow with the Cro&s;&s;e, in the rere there came two of the Prie&s;ts in their copes, and other &s;tately ve&s;timents: between both a young lad with the incen&s;e-pot, made full of holes to let out the &s;ume; which he &s;wingeth on all &s;ides of him, with a chain, to which it was fa&s;tned: having thus marched through the Church and cen&s;ed the people, he a&s;cendeth unto the Altar, and there cen&s;eth the cro&s;&s;e, the relicks, the bread, the wine, the chalice, the images: and I know not what not. A cu&s;tome very much u&s;ed among&s;t the Heathen. <HI>Omnibus viris factae &s;unt &s;tatu&s;e &amp; ad eas thus &amp; cerei,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Tully:</HI> and, <HI>Jane tibi primam thura merum&abque; fero,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>de Fa&s;tis.</HI> So have we in <HI>Martiall, Te primum piathura rogent:</HI> and the like in divers other writers of antient. At what time it crept in|to the Churches of the Chri&s;tians, I cannot tell. Sure I am it was not u&s;ed in the primitive times, nor in the third age after our Saviour: &s;ave only in their burials, <HI>Sciant Sabaei</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who at that time lived) <HI>pluris &amp; ca|riores merces &s;uas, Chri&s;tianis &s;epeliendis profligari, quam fumigan|tibus.

There was al&s;o another crime objected again&s;t her, as namely that &s;he
<PB N="141" REF="95">
had abu&s;ed the nature of her &s;exe, marching up and down in the habit of a man, <HI>Et nihil muliebre praeter corpus gerens.</HI> Of all accu&s;ations the mo&s;t impotent, for in what other habit could &s;he dre&s;&s;e her &s;elf, undertaking, the actions of a Generall? and be&s;ides, to have worn her womans weeds in time of battail, had been to have betrayed her &s;afe|ty; and to have made her &s;elf the mark of every arrow.

<P>As for that other imputation of being a Witch, &s;aving the credit of tho&s;e which condemn'd her, and theirs al&s;o who in their writings have &s;o reported her: I dare be of the contrary opinion, for dividing her actions into two parts, tho&s;e which preceded her coming unto <HI>Orleans,</HI> and tho&s;e which followed it: I finde much in it of cunning, &s;ome|what perhaps of valour: but nothing that is devilli&s;h. Her relieving of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and courage &s;hewn at the bat|tails of <HI>Patay</HI> and <HI>Gergeau,</HI> with her conducting of the King unto <HI>Rhemes:</HI> are not &s;uch prodigies, that they need to be a&s;cribed unto witchcraft. She was not the fir&s;t woman whom the world knew famed in armes, there being no Na|tion almo&s;t of the earth, who have not had a Champion of this &s;exe, to defend their Liberties: to omit the whole Nation of <HI>Amazons.</HI> To the Jewes in the time of their af|flictions, the Lord rai&s;ed up &s;alvation by means of two women, <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Judith:</HI> and God is not the God of the <HI>Jewes</HI> only, but al&s;o of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Syrians Ze|nobia</HI> Queen of <HI>Pabnira</HI> is very famous; the <HI>Romans</HI> whom &s;he often foyled, never mentioning her without honour.

under the conduct of <HI>Voaditia:</HI> and &s;he in the beginning of her incouragements to the action, telleth the people this, <HI>Solitum quidem Britannis foeminarum ductu bellare.</HI> Of all the&s;e heroical Ladies, I read no accu&s;ation of witchcraft: inva|&s;ive courage and a &s;en&s;e of injury, being the armes they fought withall; neither can I &s;ee why the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;hould ex|ceed us in mode&s;ty; or that we need envie unto the <HI>French</HI> this one female warriour, when it is a fortune which hath befaln mo&s;t Nations. As for her atchievements, they are not &s;o much beyond a common being: but that they may be imputed to natural means: for had &s;he been a Witch, it is likely &s;he would have prevented the di&s;grace which her va|lour &s;uffered, in the ditches of <HI>Paris,</HI> though &s;he could not avoid tho&s;e of <HI>Compeigne,</HI> who took her pri&s;oner: the Devill at &s;uch an exigent only being accu&s;tomed to for&s;ake tho&s;e which he hath entangled. So that &s;he enjoyed not &s;uch a perpetuity of felicity, as to entitle her to the Devils a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, &s;he being &s;ometimes conqueror, &s;ometimes overthrown, and at la&s;t impri&s;oned. <HI>Communia fortunae ludibria,</HI> the ordinary &s;ports of fortune. Her actions before her march to <HI>Orleans,</HI> have &s;omewhat in them of cunning, and perhaps of impo|&s;ture, as the vi&s;ion which &s;he reported to have incited her to the&s;e attempts, her finding out of the King di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a countrey man; and her appointing to her &s;elf an old Sword hanging in St. <HI>Katharines</HI> Church in <HI>Tours.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were at this time meerly cre&s;t faln: not to be rai&s;ed but by miracle. This therefore is invented, and &s;o that which of all the re&s;t mu&s;t prove her a &s;orcere&s;&s;e, will only prove her an impo&s;tor. <HI>Gerrard, Seigneur du Hailan,</HI> one of the be&s;t wri|ters of <HI>France,</HI> is of opinion that all that plot of her coming to the King, was contriv'd by three Lords of the Court; to hearten the people; as if God now miraculou&s;ly intended the re&s;tauration of the Kingdome. Add to this, that &s;he never commanded in any battail, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;t Captains of the <HI>French</HI> Nation: and among&s;t whom was the Ba&s;tard of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who is thought to have put this device into her head. The Lord of <HI>Bellay</HI> in his di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>arte militarie,</HI> proceedeth further, and maketh her a man: only thus habited, <HI>pour faire revenir le courage aux Francois:</HI> which,

had it been &s;o, would have been di&s;covered at the time of her burning.

And that &s;he might carry with her the reputation of a Prophe|te&s;&s;e, and an Amba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;e from heaven; admit this, and fare|well witchcraft. And for the &s;entence of her condemnation, and the confirmation of it by the Divines and Univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris;</HI> it is with me of no moment: being compo&s;ed only to humour the Victor. If this could &s;way me, I had more rea&s;on to incline to the other party; for when <HI>Charles</HI> had &s;etled his e&s;tate, the &s;ame men, who had condemned her of &s;orcery, ab&s;olved her: and there was al&s;o added in defence of her innocency, a Decree from the Court of <HI>Rome.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have now done with the Town and City of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and am come unto the Univer&s;ity or Schools of Law which are in it; this being one of the fir&s;t places in which the &s;tudy of the Civill Lawes was revived in <HI>Europe.</HI> For immediately after the death of <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> who out of no le&s;&s;e then 2000 volumes of law-writers had collected that bodie of the Imperiall Lawes, which we now call the <HI>Dige&s;ts,</HI> or the <HI>Pandects:</HI> the &s;tudy of them grew neglected in the&s;e We&s;tern parts, nor did any for a long time profe&s;&s;e or read them; the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e <HI>Italy, France, Spain, England</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> having received new Lords over them; as the <HI>Franks, Lombards, Saxons, Saracens,</HI> and others were fain to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to their Laws. It happened afterwards that <HI>Lotharius Saxo</HI> the Emperour, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">gan his reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1126. (being 560 years after the death of <HI>Ju&s;tinian)</HI> having taken the City of <HI>Melphy</HI> in <HI>Naples,</HI> found there an old copy of the <HI>Pandects.</HI> This he gave to the <HI>Pi&s;ans</HI> his confederates, as a mo&s;t reverend relick of Learning and Antiquity; whence it is called
<PB N="146" REF="98">
<HI>Littera Pi&s;ana.</HI> Moreover he founded the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Bologne</HI> or <HI>Bononia,</HI> ordering the Civill Law to be profe&s;t there: one <HI>Wirner</HI> being the fir&s;t Profe&s;&s;or; upon who&s;e advice the &s;aid Emperor ordained that <HI>Bononia</HI> &s;hould be <HI>Legum &amp; juris Schola una &amp; &s;ola:</HI> and here was the fir&s;t time and place of that &s;tudy in the We&s;tern Empire. But it was not the fate only of the Civill Laws, to be thus neglected. All other parts of learning, both Arts and languages, were in the &s;ame de&s;pe|rate e&s;tates; the Poets exclamation of <HI>O &s;aeclum in&s;ipiens &amp; infacetum,</HI> never being &s;o applyable as in tho&s;e times. For it is with the knowledge of good letters, as it was with the effects of nature; they have times of groweth alike, of per|fection and of death. Like the &s;ea, it hath its ebbs as well as its flouds; and like the earth, it hath its Winter, wherein the &s;eeds of it are deaded and bound up, as well as a Spring wherein it reflouri&s;heth. Thus the learning of the <HI>Greeks</HI> lay forgotten, and lo&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI> for 700 years, even un|till <HI>Emanuel Chry&s;olaras</HI> taught it at <HI>Venice,</HI> being driven out of his Countrey by the <HI>Turks.</HI> Thus the Philo|&s;ophy of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> lay hidden in the moath of du&s;t and libraries, <HI>Et nominabatur potius quod legebatur,</HI> as <HI>Ludovicus Vives</HI> ob&s;erveth in his notes upon St. <HI>Au&s;tine,</HI> untill the time of <HI>Alexander Aphrodi&s;eus.</HI> And thus al&s;o lay the ele|gancies of the <HI>Roman</HI> tongue ob&s;cured, till that <HI>Era&s;mus, More</HI> and <HI>Reuchlyn,</HI> in the &s;everall Kingdomes of <HI>Germany, England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> endeavoured the re&s;tauration of it.</P>
<P>But to return to the Civill Law. After the foundati|on of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Bologne,</HI> it plea&s;ed <HI>Philip le bel</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> to found another here at <HI>Orleans,</HI> for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>anno</HI> 1312. which was the fir&s;t School of that profe&s;&s;ion on this &s;ide the mountains. This is evident by the Bull of <HI>Clement</HI> V. dated at <HI>Lyons</HI> in the year 1367. where he giveth it this title, <HI>Fructiferum univer&s;itatis Aure|lianen&s;ts intra caetera citramontana &s;tudia, prius &s;olennius, anti|quius, tam civilis, quam Canonicae facultatis &s;tudium.</HI> At the fir&s;t there were in&s;tituted eight Profe&s;&s;ors, now they are reduced to four only; the rea&s;on of this decrea&s;e, being the increa&s;e of Univer&s;ities. The place in which they read
<PB N="147" REF="98">
their Lectures, is called <HI>Les grand e&s;coles,</HI> and part of the City, <HI>La Univer&s;ite;</HI> neither of which attributes it can any way remit. <HI>Colledge</HI> they have none, either to lodge the &s;tudents, or enter|tain the Profe&s;&s;ors, the former &s;ojourning in divers places of the Town, the&s;e la&s;t in their &s;everall hou&s;es. As for their place of reading which they call <HI>Les grans e&s;coles,</HI> it is only an old barn converted into a School, by the addition of five ranks of formes, and a pew in the middle, you never &s;aw a thing &s;o mock its own name: <HI>Lucus</HI> not being more properly called &s;o <HI>a non lucendo,</HI> then this ruinous hou&s;e is a great School, becau&s;e it is little. The pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ors are Mr. <HI>Furner,</HI> the <HI>Rector</HI> at my being there; Mr. <HI>Tuillerie,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Grand.</HI> The fourth of them named Mr. <HI>Augrand,</HI> was newly dead, and his place like a dead pay among Souldiers not &s;upplyed; in which e&s;tate was the function of Mr. <HI>Brodee,</HI> who&s;e office it was to read the Book of In&s;titutions, unto &s;uch as come newly to the Town. They read each of them an hour, in their turns, every morning in the week, un|le&s;&s;e Holydayes and Thur&s;dayes, their hearers taking their Lectures in their tables. Their principall office is that of the <HI>Rector,</HI> which every three months de&s;cends down unto the next, &s;o that once in a year, every one of the profe&s;&s;ors hath his turn of being <HI>Rector.</HI> The next in dignity unto him is the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> who&s;e office is during life, and in who&s;e name all degrees are given, and the Letters Authenticall, as they term them, granted. The pre&s;ent <HI>Chancellour</HI> is named Mr. <HI>Bouchier</HI> Dr. of Divinity and of both the Laws, and <HI>Prebend</HI> al&s;o of St. <HI>Croix;</HI> his place is in the gift of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orleans;</HI> and &s;o are the <HI>Chancellors</HI> places in all <HI>France</HI> at the be&s;towing of the <HI>Dioce&s;an.</HI> Antiently it was thus al&s;o with us at <HI>Oxford;</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincolne</HI> nominating to us our <HI>Chancellors,</HI> till the year 1370. <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Remington</HI> being the fir&s;t <HI>Chancellour</HI> elected by the Univer&s;ity.</P>

Tho&s;e few books which were there, were as old as Printing; and could hardly make among&s;t them one cover, to re&s;i&s;t the violence of a rat.

He that would ever gue&s;&s;e them to have been looked into &s;ince the long reign of ignorance, might ju&s;tly have condemned his own charity; for my part, I was prone to believe that the three la&s;t centuries of years had never &s;een the in&s;ide of them; or that the poor paper had been troubled with the di&s;ea&s;e called <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lime tangere.</HI> In this un|luckie roome do they hold their di&s;putations, unle&s;&s;e they be &s;olemn and full of expectation, and after two or three arguments urged, commend the &s;ufficiency of the <HI>Re&s;pondent,</HI> and pronounce him worthy of his degree.

Had they bent their &s;tudies that way, I per&s;wade my &s;elf they would have been excellent good at the Common Lawes; their tongues &s;o naturally falling upon tho&s;e words which are nece&s;&s;ary to a Decla|ration.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Orleans</HI> not an Univer&s;ity till the coming of the Je&s;uites. Their Colledge there by whom built. The Je&s;uites no &s;ingers. Their laudable and ex|act method of teaching. Their policies in it. Received not without great difficulty into <HI>Paris.</HI> Their hou&s;es in that Univer&s;ity. Their &s;trictne&s;s unto the rules of their order. Much maliced by the other Prie&s;ts and Fryers. Why not &s;ent into <HI>England</HI> with the Queen; and of what order they were that came with her. Our returne to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe difference between an Univer&s;ity and an Aca|demie &s;tanding thus, Tho&s;e which lived in our Fathers dayes could hardly have called <HI>Orleans</HI> an Univer&s;ity; a School of Law being the name mo&s;t fit for it. At this time &s;ince the coming of the Je&s;uites, that appellation may not misbecome it, they having brought with them tho&s;e parts of learning, which before were wanting in it: but this hath not been of any long &s;tand|ing, their Colledge being not yet fully fini&s;hed. By an in&s;cription over the gate, it &s;eemeth to be the work of Mr. <HI>Gagliery,</HI> one of the Advocates in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> a man of large practi&s;e, and by con&s;equence, of great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and who having no childe but this Colledge, is &s;aid to intend the fa&s;tning of his e&s;tate upon it. In this hou&s;e do tho&s;e of this order apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of good Letters, in the pur&s;uit whereof, as the re&s;t of this fracernity are, they are good proficients, and much exceed all other &s;orts of Fryers, as having better teachers and
<PB N="153" REF="101">
more lea&s;ure to learn. That time which the other &s;pent at high Ma&s;&s;es, and at their Canonicall hours, the&s;e men be&s;towed upon their books: they being exempted from the&s;e duties by their order. Upon this ground they trouble not their heads with the crotchets of Mu&s;ick, nor &s;pend their moneths upon the chanting out of their &s;ervices. They have other matters to imploy their brains upon, &s;uch as are the ruin of Kingdoms, and de&s;olation of Countries. It was the &s;aying of <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> being reque&s;ted to play a le&s;&s;on on the Lute, <HI>That he could not fidle, but he could tell how to make a little Town a great City.</HI> The like we may &s;ay of the Je&s;uites; They are no great &s;ingers, but are well skil|led in making little Cities great, and great ones little. And certain it is, that they are &s;o far from any ability or de&s;ire this way, that upon any of their &s;olemn Fe&s;tivals, when their Statutes require mu&s;ick, they are faine to hire the &s;inging men of the next <HI>Cathedrall.</HI> As here upon the fea&s;t of their Patron St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> being the 21 of <HI>July,</HI> they were compelled to make u&s;e of the voyces of the Church of St. <HI>Croix.</HI></P>
<P>To this advantage of lea&s;ure is added the exact method of their teaching, which is indeed &s;o excellent, that the Prote&s;tants them&s;elves in &s;ome places &s;end their &s;ons to their Schools; upon de&s;ire to have them prove exqui&s;ite in tho&s;e arts they teach. To them re&s;ort the children of the rich as well as of the poor, and that in &s;uch abundance, that where&s;oever they &s;ettle, other hou&s;es become in a manner de&s;olate, or frequented only by tho&s;e of the more heavie and phlegmatick con&s;titutions. Into their Schooles when they have received them, they place them in that forum or Cla&s;&s;is into w^c^h they are be&s;t fitted to enter. Of the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es, the lowe&s;t is for Grammar: the &s;econd for Compo&s;i|tion, or the making of Theames, as we call it: the third for Poetry: the fourth for Oratory: the fifth for Greek Grammar and compo&s;itions: the &s;ixt for the Poe&s;ie and Rhetorick of that language: the &s;eventh for Logick: and the eight and la&s;t for Philo&s;ophy. In each of the&s;e Schooles there is a &s;everall Reader or In&s;titutor, who only mindeth that art, and the perfection of it, which for that year he
<PB N="154" REF="102">
teacheth. That year ended, he removeth both him&s;elf and Scholars with him, into the Cla&s;&s;is or Schooles next beyond him, till he hath brought them through the whole &s;tudies of humanity. In this la&s;t forme, which is that of Philo&s;ophy, he continueth two years, which once expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Univer&s;ity of learning, and them|&s;elves manumitted from their labours, and permitted their private &s;tudies. Nor do they only teach their Scholars an ex|actne&s;&s;e in tho&s;e &s;everal parts of Learning which they handle, but they al&s;o endevour to breed in them an ob&s;tinacy of mind, and a &s;turdy eagerne&s;&s;e of &s;pirit to make them thereby hot pro&s;ecutors of their own opinions, and impatient of any con|trary con&s;ideration. This is it which maketh all tho&s;e of their education, to affect victory in all the controver&s;ies of wit or knowledge, with &s;uch a violence, that even in their very Grammaticall di&s;putations, you &s;hall find little boyes maintaine arguments with &s;uch a fierie impatience, that you would think it above the nature of their years. And all this they performe freely and for nothing; the poor Pai&s;ants &s;on being by them equally in&s;tructed, with that of the Noble&s;t.</P>
<P>By this means they get unto their Society, great honour, and great &s;trength; honour in furni&s;hing their Schooles with &s;o many per&s;ons of excellent quality or Nobility, of whom afterwards they make their be&s;t advantages for their &s;trength al&s;o. As for tho&s;e of the poorer &s;ort, they have al&s;o their ends upon them; for by this free and liberall education of their children, the common people do infinitely affect them: be&s;ides that, out of that ranke of their Scholars they a&s;&s;ume &s;uch into their fraternity, whom they finde to be of a rare wit and excellent &s;pirit, or any other way fitted for their pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Thus do they make their own purpo&s;es out of all conditions, and refu&s;e no fi&s;h which either they can draw into their nets, or which will offer it &s;elf unto them. <HI>Si locuples quis e&s;t, avari&s;unt, &s;i pauper, ambitio&s;i, quos non oriens, non occidens &s;atiaverit, &s;oli omnium opes atque inopiam pari affectu concu|pi&s;cunt: Galgacus</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Captain, &s;pake it of the Souldiers of the <HI>Romans</HI> Empire: we may as ju&s;tly verifie it of the&s;e Souldiers of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, they being the men whom
<PB N="155" REF="102">
neither the <HI>We&s;t</HI> nor <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> can &s;atisfie; and who with a like fervencie de&s;ire the education of the needy and the wealthy. Moreover, by this method of teaching they do not only &s;trengthen them&s;elves in the affections of men a broad, but al&s;o fortifie them&s;elves within their own wals at home; for by this means, there is not one of their &s;ociety, who hath not only perfectly concocted in his head the whole <GAP DESC="foreign"> of knowledge, but hath gained unto him|&s;elf the true art of &s;peaking, and a readine&s;&s;e of expre&s;&s;ing what he knoweth; without the lea&s;t demurre or hae&s;itancie: the greate&s;t happine&s;&s;e of a Scholar. To conclude then and &s;ay no more of them, and their rare abilities (for <HI>virtus &amp; in ho&s;te probatur)</HI> it is thought by men of wi&s;dome and judge|ment, that the planting of a Colledge of Je&s;uites in any place, is the onely &s;ure way to ree&s;tabli&s;h that Religion which they profe&s;&s;e, and in time to eate out the contrary.</P>
<P>This notwith&s;tanding, they were at the fir&s;t in&s;titution of them mightily oppo&s;ed, and no where more violently then in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris.</HI> An Univer&s;ity that &s;tan|deth much upon its liberty and priviledges; to which this order was imagined to be an hindrance: it being lawfull for them to take any degree in their own hou&s;es, without reference to any publick exerci&s;e or examination. In the year 1554. at what time they fir&s;t began to &s;et foot in <HI>France,</HI> the Colledge of the <HI>Sorboni&s;ts</HI> made a long decree again&s;t them, in the end whereof are the&s;e words, and they are worth the reading, <HI>Uidetur haec &s;ocietas in negotio fidei pericu|lo&s;a, pacis Eccle&s;iae perturbativa, mona&s;ticae religionis ever&s;iva &amp; magis ad de&s;tructionem, quam ad adificationem;</HI> a cen&s;ure too full of vineger and bitterne&s;&s;e. Afterwards in the year 1564. they preferred a Petition to the Univer&s;ity, that the Colledge which the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Clermont</HI> had built for them, might be incorporated into the Univer&s;ity, and enjoy the immunities of it. Upon the Univer&s;ities deniall of their de&s;ire, there aro&s;e a &s;uit between them and the Univer&s;ity in the high Court of Parliament; <HI>Peter Ver&s;oris</HI> pleading for the Je&s;uits, and <HI>Stephen Pa&s;quier</HI> for the other party.

In the end they were admitted, though upon terms of won|drous &s;trictne&s;&s;e. <HI>Anno 1594. John Ca&s;tell</HI> a novice of this order, having wounded King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in the mouth, occa&s;ioned the bani&s;hment of this Society out of all <HI>France,</HI> into which they were not again received till the year 1604. and then al&s;o upon limitations more &s;trict then ever. Into <HI>Paris</HI> they were not readmitted untill <HI>anno</HI> 1606. neither had the liberty of reading Lectures and in&s;tructing the youth confirmed unto them till <HI>anno</HI> 1611. which al&s;o was compa&s;&s;ed not without great trouble and vexation.

<P>In this Univer&s;ity they have at this in&s;tant three hou&s;es, one of the Novices, a &s;econd of In&s;titutors, which they call the Colledge; and a third of profe&s;&s;ed Je&s;uites, which they &s;tyle their Mona&s;tery, or the profe&s;&s;ed hou&s;e of St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> In their hou&s;e of Novices they train up all tho&s;e whom they have culled out of their Schooles to be of their order, and therein initiate them in the arts of Je&s;uiti&s;m, and their my&s;teries of iniquity. They there teach them not Gram|maticall con&s;tructions or compo&s;ition, but in&s;truct them in the paths of virtue, courage and obedience, according to &s;uch examples as their Authors afford them. This they &s;ay of them&s;elves and their friends for them.

60000 crowns; they added to it the Court called <HI>De Langres,</HI> in St. <HI>James &s;treet, anno</HI> 1582. Their Mona&s;tery or hou&s;e of profe&s;&s;ion is that unto which they retire them&s;elves after they have di&s;charged their duties in the Colledge, by reading and &s;tudying publickly in their &s;everall Cla&s;&s;es. When they are here, their &s;tudies both for time and quality is <HI>ad placitum;</HI> though generally their only &s;tudie in it is Policy, and the advantage of their cau&s;e. And indeed out of this <HI>Trojan</HI> hor&s;e it is, that tho&s;e firebrands and incendiaries are let out to di&s;turb and &s;et in combu&s;tion the affaires of Chri&s;ten|dom, out of this forge come all tho&s;e &s;tratagems and tricks of <HI>Machiavilliani&s;m,</HI> which tend to the ruine of the Prote&s;tants, and the de&s;olation of their Countries.

Being &s;ent once by their Superiors, a nece&s;&s;ity is layed upon them of obedience, be the imployment never &s;o dangerous. And certainly this Nation doth mo&s;t &s;trictly obey the rules of their order, of any what&s;oever, not excepting the <HI>Capou|chins</HI> nor the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> This I am witne&s;&s;e to, that where|as the Divinity Lecture is to end at the tilling of a Bell; one of the Society in the Colledge of <HI>Clermont,</HI> reading about the fall of the Angels, ended his Lecture with the&s;e words, <HI>Denique in quibu&s;eunque;</HI> for then was the warning given, and he dur&s;t not &s;o far tre&s;pa&s;&s;e upon his rule, as to &s;peak out his &s;entence.</P>
<P>But it is not the fate of the&s;e Je&s;uits to have great per&s;ons only, and Univer&s;ities only to oppo&s;e their fortunes: they have al&s;o the mo&s;t accompli&s;ht malice, that either the &s;ecular Prie&s;ts or Fryers among&s;t whom they live, can fa&s;ten upon them.

<P><HI>JUly</HI> the 27. having di&s;patched that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e which brought us into <HI>France,</HI> and &s;urveyed as much of the Countrey, as that opportunity would permit, we began our journey towards <HI>England</HI> in a Coach of <HI>Amiens.</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="106">
Better accompaned we were then when we came from <HI>Orleans,</HI> for here we had Gentlemen of the choice&s;t fa&s;hi|on, very ingenious, and in my opinion of finer condi|tion then any I had met withall in all my acquaintance with that Nation. We had no vexation with us in the &s;hape of a <HI>French</HI> woman, which appeared unto me &s;ome|what miraculous, to torment our ears with her di&s;cour&s;e, or puni&s;h our eyes with her complexion. Thus a&s;&s;ociated we began to jog towards St. <HI>Loup,</HI> where that night we were to be lodged. The Countrey &s;uch as already I have de&s;cribed it in the I&s;le of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ave that beyond St. <HI>Denis</HI> it began to be &s;omewhat more hilly. By the way I ob|&s;erved tho&s;e little cro&s;&s;ets erected in the memorie of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> as being vainly &s;uppo&s;ed to be his re&s;ting places, when he ran from <HI>Mont-martre</HI> with his head in his hand, which the zealous madne&s;&s;e of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> had thrown down, and were now reedified by King <HI>Lewis.</HI> It could not but call to mind the hate of that Nation unto that harmele&s;&s;e monument of Chri&s;ts &s;ufferings, the Cro&s;&s;e; which is grown it &s;eemeth &s;o exorbitant, that the Papi&s;ts make u&s;e of it to di&s;cover an <HI>Hugonot.</HI> I remember as I pa&s;&s;ed by water from <HI>Amiens</HI> to <HI>Abbeville,</HI> we met in the boat with a levie of <HI>French</HI> Gentlewomen; to one of them, with that <HI>French</HI> as I had, I applyed my &s;elf, and &s;he perceiving me to be <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> que&s;tioned my Religion. I an&s;wered (as I &s;afely might) that I was a <HI>Catholick:</HI> and &s;he for her better &s;a|tisfaction proffered me the little cro&s;&s;e which was on the top of her beads to ki&s;&s;e, (and rather &s;hould I de&s;ire to ki&s;&s;e it then many of their lips) whereupon the re&s;t of the company gave of me this verdit, that I was <HI>Un urai Chri&s;tien, &amp; ne point un Hugonot.</HI> But to proceed in our journall. The &s;ame day we parted from <HI>Paris,</HI> we pa&s;|&s;ed through the Town of <HI>Luzarch,</HI> and came to that of St. <HI>Loup.</HI> The fir&s;t famous only in its owner, which is the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons.</HI> The &s;econd in an Abbey there &s;ituate built in memory of St. <HI>Lupus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Trios</HI> in <HI>Cham|pagne.</HI> The&s;e Townes pa&s;&s;ed, we were entred into <HI>Pi|cardie.</HI></P>

<HI>Picardie</HI> is divided into the higher, which containeth the Countries of <HI>Calice</HI> and <HI>Boulogne,</HI> with the Town <HI>Mon&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">vill:</HI> and the lower, in which are the goodly Cities of <HI>Amiens, Abbeville,</HI> and many other places of principall note. The higher which is the le&s;&s;er, and more Northern part is bounded North and We&s;t with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ocean; and on the Ea&s;t with <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Artoys.</HI> The lower, which is the larger, the richer and the more Southern, hath on the Ea&s;t the little Country of <HI>Veromandys;</HI> on the We&s;t <HI>Normandy;</HI> and on the South the Countrey of <HI>Champagne.</HI> In length it comprehendeth all the 51 degree of Latitude, and three parts of the 50; extending from <HI>Calice</HI> in the North, to <HI>Clermont</HI> in the South. In breadth it is of a great inequality. For the higher <HI>Picardie</HI> is like <HI>Linea</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Logitians,</HI> which they de&s;ine to be <HI>longitudo &s;ine latitudine,</HI> it being indeed nothing in a manner, but a meer border. The lower is of a larger breadth, and containeth in it the whole 24 degree of longitude, and a fourth part of the 23; &s;o that by the proportion of degrees, this Province is 105 miles long, and 25 broad.</P>
<P>Concerning the name of <HI>Pieardie,</HI> it is a difficulty beyond my reading and my conjecture. All I can do is to over|throw the le&s;&s;e probable opinions of other writers, and make my &s;elf &s;ubject to that &s;coffe which <HI>Lactantius</HI> be&s;toweth on <HI>Ari&s;totle, Rect&egrave; hic &s;u&s;tulit aliorum di&s;ciplinas, &s;ed non recte fundavit &s;uam.</HI> Some then derive it from <HI>Piquon,</HI> one for&s;ooth of <HI>Alexander</HI> the greats Captains, whom they fain to have built <HI>Amiens</HI> and <HI>Piquigni;</HI> an ab&s;urdity not to be honoured with a con|&s;utation: &s;ome from the Town of <HI>Piquigni</HI> it &s;elf, of which mind is <HI>Mercator;</HI> but that Town never was of &s;uch note as to name a Province: others derive it from <HI>Picardus</HI> a fanaticall Heretick of the&s;e parts, about the year 1300 and after; but the appellation is far older then the man: others fetch it from the <HI>Picts</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> whom they would have to flie hither after the di&s;comfiture of their Empire and Nation by the <HI>Scots;</HI> a tran&s;migration of which all Hi&s;tories are &s;ilent: this being the verdict of the be&s;t Antiquary ever was nur&s;ed up in. <HI>Bri|tain, Picti itaque fune&s;ti&s;&s;imo praelio debellati, aut penit us fuerunt ex|tincti, aut paulatim in Scotorum nomen &amp; nationem conce&s;&s;erint.</HI>

La&s;tly, &s;ome others derive the name from <HI>Pique,</HI> which &s;ignifieth a Lance or a Pike, the inventors of which warlike weapon, the fathers of this device would fain make them. In like manner &s;ome of <HI>Germany</HI> have laboured to prove that the <HI>Saxons</HI> had that name given them from the &s;hort &s;words which they u&s;ed to wear, called in their language <HI>Scaxon;</HI> but neither truely. For my part I have con&s;ulted <HI>Ptolemie</HI> for all the Nations; and the <HI>Itinerarium</HI> of <HI>Antonius</HI> for all the Towns in this tract, but can find none on which I may fa&s;ten any probable Etymolo|gie. All therefore that I can &s;ay, is, that which <HI>Robert</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Auranches</HI> in <HI>Normandy</HI> hath &s;aid before me, and that only in the generall, <HI>Quos itaque aetas no&s;tra Picardos appellat verae Belgae dicendi &s;unt: qui po&s;t modum in Picardorum nomen tran&s;mi|grarunt.</HI></P>

<P>This Table <HI>de Marbre</HI> was wont to be continually in the great hall of the <HI>Palais</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI> from whence upon the burn|ning of that hall, it was removed to the <HI>Louure.</HI> At this table doth the Admirall of <HI>France</HI> hold his Se&s;&s;ions, to judge of trafick, prizes, letters of marts, piracy, and bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the like nature.

hated by the Prote&s;tants as an Apo&s;tata, and &s;u&s;pected by the Papi&s;ts not to be entire.</P>
<P>To proceed, <HI>July</HI> the 28. we came unto <HI>Clermont,</HI> the fir&s;t Town of any note that we met with in <HI>Picardie:</HI> a prety neat Town, and finely &s;eated on the ri&s;ing of an hill. For the de|fence of it, it hath on the upper &s;ide of it, an indifferent large Ca&s;tle, and &s;uch which were the &s;ituation of it &s;omewhat hel|ped by the &s;trength of Art, might be brought to do good &s;er|vice. Towards the Town, it is of an ea&s;ie acce&s;&s;e, to the fieldwards more difficult, as being built on the perpendicular fall of a rock. In the year 1615, it was made good by Mr. <HI>Ha|rancourt</HI> with a Regiment of eight Companies, who kept it in the name of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the re&s;t of that confe|deracy; but it held not long, for at the Mar&s;hall <HI>D' Ancres</HI> coming before it with his Army, and Artillery, it was pre|&s;ently yeelded. This war, which was the &s;econd civill war which had happened in the reign of King <HI>Lewis,</HI> was under|taken by the Princes, chiefly to thwart the de&s;ignes of the Queen mother, and cru&s;h the powerfulne&s;&s;e of her grand fa|vourite, the Mar&s;hall. The pretence (as in &s;uch ca&s;es it com|monly is) was the good of the Common-wealth: the oc|ca&s;ion, the cro&s;&s;e marriages then con&s;ummated by the Mar|&s;hall, between the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> for by tho&s;e marriages they &s;eemed to fear the augmentation of the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> greatne&s;&s;e; the alienation of the affections of their an|tient allies; and by con&s;equence the ruine of the <HI>French</HI> Empire. But it was not the fate of <HI>D' Anire,</HI> as yet to per&s;h. Two years more of command and in&s;olencies, his de&s;tinies allow'd him, and then he tumbled. This opportunity of his death ending the third civill war, each of which his faulty greatne&s;&s;e had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>What the ambition of his de&s;ignes did tend to, I dare not ab&s;olutely determine; though like enough it is, that they aimed further then at a private, or a per&s;onall potencie; for having under the favour and countenance of the Queen mo|ther made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Kings ear, and of his Coun|cell; he made a &s;hift to get into his own hands an authority almo&s;t as unlimited, as that of the old <HI>Mayre</HI> of the Palace. For he had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the liberty of the generall e&s;tates, and of the
<PB N="168" REF="109">
&s;overaign Courts; removed all the officers and Coun&s;ellors of the la&s;t King; ravi&s;hed one of the Pre&s;idents of the great Chamber, by name Mr. <HI>le Jay,</HI> out of the Parliament into the pri&s;on, and planted Garri&s;ons of his own in mo&s;t of the good Towns of <HI>Normandy,</HI> of which Province he was Governour. Add to this, that he had cau&s;ed the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> being acknowledged the fir&s;t Prince of the bloud, to be impri&s;oned in the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and had &s;earched into the continuance of the lives of the King and his brother, by the help of Sorcery and Witchcraft. Be&s;ides, he was &s;u&s;pected to have had &s;ecret in|telligence with &s;ome forain Princes, ill willers to the State; and had di&s;graced &s;ome and neglected others of the Kings old confederates. Certainly the&s;e actions &s;eem to import &s;ome project beyond a private and obedient greatne&s;&s;e, though I can hardly believe that he dur&s;t be ambitious of the Crown; for being a fellow of a low birth, his heart could not but be too narrow for &s;uch an hope, and having no party among&s;t the Nobility, and being le&s;&s;e gracious with the people, he was altogether de&s;titute of means to compa&s;&s;e it. I therefore am of an opinion, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gold had corrupted him to &s;ome project concerning the enlargement of that Empire, upon the <HI>French</HI> dominion; which the cro&s;&s;e marriages, whereof he was the contriver, and which &s;eemed &s;o full of danger to all the be&s;t Patriots of <HI>France,</HI> may &s;eem to demon|&s;trate. And again, at that time when he had put the Realm into his third combu&s;tion, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had an Army on foot again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and another in the Coun|tries of <HI>Cleve</HI> and <HI>Juliers;</HI> which had not the timely fall of this Mon&s;ter, and the peace en&s;uing prevented it, might both perhaps have met together in the mid&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> But this on|ly conjecturall.</P>

<P>The fair City of <HI>Amiens;</HI> and greatne&s;&s;e of it. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fea&s;ted within it; and the error of that action; the Town how built, &s;eated and fortified. The Citadell of it, thought to be impregnable. Not permitted to be viewed. The overmuch openne&s;&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in di&s;covering their &s;trength. The watch and form of Government in the Town. <HI>Amiens</HI> a Vi&s;damate: to whom it pertaineth. What that honour is in <HI>France.</HI> And how many there en|joy it, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat night we went from <HI>Clermont</HI> to a Town called <HI>Bret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aul,</HI> where we were harboured: being from <HI>Clermont 6 French</HI> leagues; and from <HI>Paris</HI> 20. Our entertainment there &s;uch as in other places: as &s;lutti&s;h, as inconvenient. The next day being the 29, about ten of the clock, we had a &s;ight of the goodly City of <HI>Amiens.</HI> A City of &s;ome four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles circuit within the wals, which is all the greatne&s;&s;e of it: for without the wals it hath hou&s;es few or none. A City very capacious, and for that cau&s;e hath been many times honoured with the per|&s;ons and trains of many great Princes: be&s;ides that once it entertained almo&s;t an whole Army of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For King <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11. having made an advantagious peace with our <HI>Edward</HI> 4. and perceiving how ungratefull it was among&s;t the military men, he intended al&s;o to give them &s;ome manner of &s;atisfaction: He &s;ent therefore unto them 300 carts loaden with the be&s;t Wines: and &s;eeing how ac|ceptable a pre&s;ent that had proved; he intended al&s;o to fea&s;t them in <HI>Amiens,</HI> within half a league of which their Camp was lodged. This entertainment la&s;ted four daies,
<PB N="170" REF="110">
each &s;treet having in it two long tables: and each table be|ing furni&s;hed with very plentiful provi&s;ion. Neither were they denied entrance into any of the Taverns, and Victu|alling hou&s;es, or therein &s;tinted either in meats, or drinks; what&s;oever was called for, being defrayed by King <HI>Lewis.</HI> An action wherein, if mine opinion might carry it, there was little of the politician. For there were permitted to enter into the Town &s;o many at once of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, that had they been but &s;o minded, they might ea&s;ily have made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters both of the place, and of the Kings per&s;on. Nine thou&s;and are reckoned by <HI>Cumines</HI> to have been within it together, and mo&s;t of them armed: &s;o that they might very ea&s;ily have &s;urpri&s;ed the Gates, and let in the re&s;t of the Army. Tho&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Kings Coun&s;ell much feared it, and therefore enformed both Princes of the dan|ger, the one of his Town, the other of his Honour. But this jealou&s;ie was but a <HI>French</HI> di&s;tru&s;t, and might well have been &s;pared: the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being of that Generals minde, who &s;corned to &s;teal a victory, and of that generous di&s;po&s;ition, that they would not betray their credits. <HI>Nunquam illis adei ulla opportuna vi&s;a e&s;t victoriae occa&s;io, quam damno pen&s;arent fi|des:</HI> as the Hi&s;torian of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> If this City then e&s;caped a &s;ack or a &s;urpri&s;al, it cannot be imputed to the wi&s;dome of the <HI>French,</HI> but to the mode&s;ty and fair dealing of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But this was not the only &s;oloeci&s;m in point of &s;tate, committed by that great politick of his time, King <HI>Lewis:</HI> there never being man &s;o famed for his brain, that more gro&s;ly over-reached him&s;elf, then that Prince, though perhaps more frequently.</P>
<P>The buildings of this Town are of diver&s;e materials, &s;ome built of &s;tone, others of wood, and &s;ome again of both. The &s;treets very &s;weet and clean, and the air not giving place to any for a lively purene&s;s. Of their buildings the principal are their Churches, whereof there are twelve on|ly in number: Churches I mean parochial, and be&s;ides tho&s;e belonging to Religious hou&s;es. Next unto them the work of mo&s;t e&s;pecial note, is a great and large Ho&s;pital; in me|thod and the di&s;po&s;ing of the beds much like unto the <HI>Ho|&s;tel Dieu</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> but in number much inferiour; <HI>Et me
<PB N="171" REF="110">
tamen rapuerant,</HI> and yet the decency of them did much de|light me. The &s;weetne&s;&s;e and neatne&s;&s;e of the Town, pro|ceeded partly as I &s;aid from the air, and partly from the con|veniency of the River of <HI>Some,</HI> on which it is &s;eated. For the river running in one entire bank at the further end of the Town, is there divided into &s;ix channels, which al|mo&s;t at an equall di&s;tance run through the &s;everal parts of it. Tho&s;e channels thus divided, receive into them all the ordure and filth, with which the Town otherwi&s;e might be pe&s;ter'd: and affordeth the people a plentifull mea&s;ure of water wherewith to purge the lanes, and bie cor|ners of it, as often as them li&s;teth. But this is not all the benefit of the&s;e Channels: they be&s;tow upon the City mat|ter al&s;o of commodity, which is the infinite number of Gri&s;t-mils, that are built upon them. At the other end of the Town the Channels are again united into one &s;tream: both tho&s;e places, as well of the divi&s;ion, as of the union of the Channels being exceeding well fortified with chains and piles, and al&s;o with bulwarks and out|works.</P>
<P>Neither is the Town well fortified and &s;trengthned at tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages only: the other parts of it having enough of &s;trength to inable them to a long re&s;i&s;tance. The ditch round about it, &s;ave where it meeteth with the Citadell, is exceeding deep, and &s;teepie: the wals of a good height, broad, and compo&s;ed of earth and &s;tone equally: the one making up the out&s;ide of them, and the other the in&s;ide. The Gates are very large and &s;trong, as well in the finewie compo&s;ition of them&s;elves, as in the addition of the Draw-bridge. Suburbs this City hath none, becau&s;e a Town of war: nor any liberal circuit of territory, becau&s;e a frontier. Yet the people are indifferently wealthy, and have among&s;t them good trading; be&s;ides the benefit of the Garri&s;on, and the Cathedral. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;teth of 250 men, (500 in all they &s;hould be) who are continually in pay to guard the Citadel, their pay eight Sols daily. The Governor of them is the Duke of <HI>Chaune,</HI> who is al&s;o the Lieutenant or Deputy Governour of the whole Province under the Con|&s;table: their Captain Mr. <HI>Le Noyre,</HI> &s;aid to be a man of good
<PB N="172" REF="111">
experience, and worthy his place. This Citadel was built by <HI>Henry</HI> 4. as &s;oon as he had recovered the Town from the <HI>Spaniards, anno</HI> 1597. It is &s;eated on the lower part of the City, though &s;omewhat on the advantage of an hill, and &s;eemeth in mine opinion, better &s;ituate to command the Town, then to defend it; or rather to recover the Town being taken, then to &s;ave it from taking. They who have &s;een it, and know the arts of fortification, report it to be impregnable.
<Q><L>&mdash;Quod nec Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is ira, nec ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</L>

<P>Nor am I able to contradict it. For be&s;ides that it is a skill beyond my profe&s;&s;ion, we were not permitted to come within it, or to take a &s;urvey of it, but at a di&s;tance. As &s;oon as we approached high unto it, one of the Garri&s;on proffes'd us the Musket: a &s;ufficient warning not to be too venturous. So that all which I could ob&s;erve was this: that they had within them&s;elves good plenty of earth to make their Gabions, and repair their breaches. With the &s;ame jealou&s;ie al&s;o, are the re&s;t of the Forts and Towns of impor|tance guarded in this and other Countreys: no people that ever I heard being &s;o open in &s;hewing their places of &s;trength and &s;afety unto &s;trangers, as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For a dozen of Ale a foreiner may pace over the curtain of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and mea&s;ure every &s;tone and bulwark of it. For a &s;hilling more he &s;hall &s;ee their provi&s;ion of powder and other muni|tion. And when that is done, if he will he &s;hall walk the round too. A <HI>French</HI> crown &s;athometh the wals of <HI>Dover</HI> Ca|&s;tle: and for a pinte of wine one may &s;ee the nakedne&s;&s;e of the blockhou&s;es at <HI>Grave&s;end.</HI> A negligence which may one day co&s;t us dearly: though we now think it not. For what el&s;e do we in it, but commit that prodigall folly, for which <HI>Pltarch</HI> condemned <HI>Pericles:</HI> that is, to break open all the pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s and inclo&s;ures of our land, to the end that every man might come in freely, and take away our fruit at his plea&s;ure. Jealou&s;ie, though a vice in a man towards his wife, is yet one of the &s;afe&s;t vertues in a Governor to|wards
<PB N="173" REF="111">
his fortre&s;&s;e: and therefore I could wi&s;h that an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> man, would in this particular borrow a little of the <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ouldiers which are continually in garri&s;on for the defence of the Citadell, there are al&s;o 300 which keep watch every night for the defence of the City. The watchmen receive no pay of the King, but di&s;charge that duty among&s;t them&s;elves, and in turns, every hou&s;e finding one for that &s;ervice, twelve nights in the year. The wea|pons which they u&s;e, are pikes only, and muskets: there being not one piece of Ordinance all about the Town, or on the wals of it. The Governor of this Town, as it hath reference to the King, is a Bailly, who hath belonging to him all the authority which belongeth to a &s;iege Pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dial. Under him he hath a Lieutenant generall, and particular; &s;even Coun&s;ellors, a publick Notary, and other inferior Officers and Magi&s;trates. As it is a Corporation, the chief Governor of it is a Maior, and next to him the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ohevins, or Sheriffs, as protectors of the inhabitants and their liber|ties: be&s;ides tho&s;e of the Common-councell.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance there is, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> this Town of <HI>Amiens,</HI> which is, that it is a Vi&s;damate: or that it giveth honour to one of the Nobility, who is called the <HI>Vi&s;|dame</HI> of <HI>Amiens.</HI> This title at this time belongeth to the Duke of <HI>Chaune,</HI> Governor of the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">adell, together with the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Piquigni:</HI> both which he obtained by marrying the daughter and heir of the la&s;t Vi&s;dame of <HI>Ami|ens,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Piquigni, anno</HI> 1619. A marriage which much advanced his fortunes, and which was compa&s;&s;ed for him by the Con&s;table <HI>Luynes</HI> his brother, who al&s;o obtained for him of the King, the title of Duke: his highe&s;t attribute before being that of Mr. <HI>de Cadinet,</HI> by which name he was known here in <HI>England,</HI> at &s;uch time when he was &s;ent extraordinary Emba&s;&s;ador to King <HI>James.</HI> This honour of Vi&s;dame, is for ought I could ever &s;ee, u&s;ed only in <HI>France.</HI> True it is that in &s;ome old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Charters we meet with this title of <HI>Vice-dominus.</HI> As in the Charter of King <HI>Edred</HI> to the Abbey of <HI>Crowland</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> dated in the year 948. there is there &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>Ego Ingulph Vice-dominus:</HI> but with us, and at
<PB N="174" REF="112">
tho&s;e times, this title was only u&s;ed to denote a &s;ubordina|tion to &s;ome &s;uperior Lord, and not as an honorary attri|bute, in which &s;en&s;e it is now u&s;ed in <HI>France.</HI> Be&s;ides that, with us it was frequently, though fal&s;ly u&s;ed for <HI>Vice comes.</HI> Between which two offices of a Vicount and a Vi&s;dame, there are found no &s;mall re&s;emblances. For as they which did <HI>gerere vicem Comitis,</HI> were called <HI>Vicecomites</HI> or Vicounts: &s;o were they al&s;o called Vidames or <HI>Vicedomini, qui domini epi|&s;copi vicem gerebant in temporalibus.</HI> And as Vicounts from offi|cers of the Earls became honorary: &s;o did the Vidames di&s;|claim their relation to the Bi&s;hop, and became Signieural or honorary al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Vidames then according to their fir&s;t in&s;titution were the &s;ub&s;titutes of the greater Bi&s;hops, in matter of &s;ecular ad|mini&s;tration: for which cau&s;e, though they have altered their tenure, they take all of them their denomination from the chieftown of &s;ome Bi&s;hoprick. Neither is there any of them, who holdeth not of &s;ome Bi&s;hoprick or other. Con|cerning the number of them that are thus dignified I cannot determine. Mr. <HI>Glover,</HI> otherwi&s;e alled <HI>Somer&s;et Herald,</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e of Nobility, publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Milles</HI> of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> putteth it down for ab&s;olute, that here are four only, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Amiens,</HI> of <HI>Chartres,</HI> of <HI>Chalons,</HI> and of <HI>Gerberey</HI> in <HI>Beau|vais;</HI> but in this he hath deceived both him&s;elf and his rea|ders, there being, be&s;ides tho&s;e divers others, as of <HI>Rheimes, Mans,</HI> and the like.

<P>THere is yet one thing which addeth more lu&s;tre to the City of <HI>Amiens,</HI> then either the Vidamate or the Citadel, which is the Church of <HI>No&s;tre Dame.</HI> A name by which mo&s;t of the principal Churches are known in <HI>France.</HI> There have we the <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> in <HI>Roven,</HI> a &s;econd in <HI>Paris,</HI> a third in this City, a fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> in <HI>Boulogne,</HI> all Cathedrall: &s;o al&s;o a <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> in <HI>Abbeville</HI> and ano|ther in <HI>E&s;tampes:</HI> the principal Church in tho&s;e Towns al|&s;o: had I &s;een more of their Towns, I had met with more of her Temples: for of &s;o many I have heard of, that if there be more then two Churches in a Town, one &s;hall be &s;ure to be dedicated unto her, and that one of the faire&s;t: of any temples con&s;ecrated to the name and memory of our Saviour, <HI>ne gry quidem:</HI> there was not &s;o much as a word &s;tir|ring, neither could I marvail at it, con&s;idering the honours done to her, and tho&s;e to her &s;on; betwixt which there is &s;o great a di&s;proportion, that you would have imagined that <HI>Mary,</HI> and not <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had been our Saviour. For one <HI>Pater no&s;ter</HI> the people are enjoyned ten <HI>Ave Maries,</HI> and to recompen&s;e one pilgrimage to Chri&s;ts Sepulchre at <HI>Hieru|&s;alem,</HI>

you &s;hall hear 200 undertaken to our Lady of <HI>Loretto:</HI> and whereas in their Kalendar they have dedicated only four fe&s;tivals to our Saviour, which are tho&s;e of his birth, circumci&s;ion, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion, (all which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church al&s;o ob&s;erveth) for the Virgins &s;ake they have more then doubled the number. Thus do they &s;olem|nize the fea&s;ts of her purification, and annuntiation, at the times which we al&s;o do: of her vi&s;itation of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in <HI>July;</HI> of her dedication and a&s;&s;umption in <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> of her nativity in <HI>September:</HI> of her pre&s;entation, in <HI>November:</HI> and of her conception in the womb of her mother, in <HI>December.</HI> To her have they appropriated &s;et formes of Prayers pre&s;cribed in the two books called, one <HI>Officium,</HI> and the other <HI>Ro&s;arium beatae Mariae virginis,</HI> whereas her &s;on mu&s;t be contented with tho&s;e orai&s;ons which are in the common Ma&s;&s;e-book. Her &s;hrines and images are more glorious and magnificent, then tho&s;e of her &s;on. And in her Chappel are more vowes paid, then before the Crucifix. But I cannot blame the vulgar, when the great ma&s;ters of their &s;ouls are thus al&s;o be&s;otted. The <HI>Officium</HI> before mentioned, publi&s;hed by the command of <HI>Pius</HI> 2. &s;aith thus of her. <HI>Gaude Maria virgo; tu &s;ola om|nes haere&s;es interemi&s;ti in univer&s;e mundo.

In one of their Councels, Chri&s;ts na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> quite forgotten, and the name of our Lady put in the place of it. For thus it beginneth: <HI>Autoritate Dei patris, &amp; beatae virginis, &amp; omnium &s;anctorum:</HI> but mo&s;t horrible is that of one of their writers (I am loth to &s;ay it was <HI>Bernard) Becta virgo mon&s;tra te e&s;&s;e matrem, jube filium:</HI> which <HI>Harding</HI> in his confutation of the apologie, endea|vouring to make good; would needs have it to be only an exce&s;&s;e of minde, or a &s;piritual &s;port and dalliance.

<P>Leaving our Lady, let us go to &s;ee her Church, which que&s;tionle&s;&s;e is one of the mo&s;t glorious piles of building under the heavens. What <HI>Velleius</HI> &s;aith of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> that he was <HI>homo qui omnibus omnium gentium viris inducturus erat caliginem:</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="113">
or what <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;pake of <HI>Titus,</HI> when he called him <HI>Delitias humani generis;</HI> both tho&s;e attributes and more too, may I mo&s;t fitly fa&s;ten on this mo&s;t magnificent Structure. The whole body of it is of mo&s;t curious and poli&s;ht &s;tone, every where born up by buttre&s;&s;es of that excellent compo&s;ure, that they &s;eem to add more of beauty to it then of &s;trength. The Quire of it, as in great Churches commonly it is, is of a fairer fabrick then the body, thick &s;et with dainty pillars, and mo&s;t of them reaching to the top of it, in the fa&s;hion of an arch. I am not well able to judge, whether this Quire, or the Chappell of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> be the more exqui&s;ite piece of Architecture; though I am not ignorant that <HI>Leland</HI> calleth that of our King <HI>Miraculum orbis.</HI> I per&s;wade my &s;elf, that a mo&s;t di&s;cerning eye could find out but little difference between them, and that difference more &s;ubtile then &s;ound: for if &s;uch perfection may receive the word of <HI>more,</HI> it might be &s;aid, that there were more maje&s;ty in this of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and more of loveline&s;&s;e in that of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> yet &s;o that the ones maje&s;ty did exceed in loveline&s;&s;e, and the others loveline&s;&s;e exceed in maje&s;ty.

<P>But now we are come unto the divinity of the workman|&s;hip; the front, which pre&s;enteth it &s;elf unto us with two Towers, and three gates, that in the mid&s;t being the princi|pall. The front of <HI>Welles</HI> or <HI>Peterborough,</HI> which we &s;o much fame in <HI>England,</HI> de&s;erve not to be named in the &s;ame myriad of years, with this of <HI>Amiens;</HI> for here have you almo&s;t all the &s;acred &s;tories engraven &s;o lively, that you would no longer think the &s;tory of <HI>Pygmalions</HI> image to be a fable; and indeed at the fir&s;t &s;ight, you would confidently believe that the hi&s;tories there pre&s;ented were not carved, but acted.

The out&s;ide of the Church being admirable, you would have thought that art and trea&s;ure had left nothing of them|&s;elves to be&s;tow within it: yet herein would &s;uch thoughts deceive you; for although the beauty of the <HI>No&s;tre dames</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roven</HI> lay mo&s;t without, yet here it &s;erveth but as a maske to hide and conceal tho&s;e mo&s;t admirable graces which are within. As &s;oon as entred you will &s;uppo&s;e that the mate|rials of it are all of gold; &s;uch a lu&s;tre doth it ca&s;t upon the eyes of all tho&s;e that look upon it. The glory of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, next unto the de&s;cription of it in the Scriptures, is be&s;t read in this Church, of which it &s;eemeth to have been the pattern. <HI>Jupiters</HI> hou&s;e in heaven de&s;cribed by the Poets, was never half &s;o gorgeous as this on the earth; that therefore which <HI>Ovid</HI> Poetically &s;pake concerning that imaginary Palace of the fal&s;e God, we may po&s;itively verifie of this reall man&s;i|on of the true God.</P>

<P>To in&s;tance in particulars; the partition between the Quire and the body, is &s;o overlaid with gold, that the acute&s;t &s;ight could apprehend no other &s;ub&s;tance of it; and yet the art of the workman &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed its power on it, that the co&s;t was much inferiour to the workman&s;hip; &s;o curi|ou&s;ly was it adorned with excellent Imagery, and what el&s;e the hand of man could fa&s;hion into portraiture: on the top of it was the Statua of our Lady in the ju&s;t height and pro|portion of a woman, all either of gold or gilded; her child in her armes, of the &s;ame making. She was there expre&s;&s;ed as &s;tanding in a round circle, unto every point of which &s;he darted out rayes and beams of gold; ju&s;t as the Sun doth &s;eem to do, when the Painter hath drawn him in his full lu&s;tre. The gla&s;&s;e of the Church generally, and particularly that about the Quire, and the Virgins Chappell, is the ful|le&s;t of life and beauty, of any that I ever yet &s;et eye upon. As much as that of St. <HI>Denis</HI> exceedeth ours at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> &s;o much doth this St. <HI>Denis.</HI> But the large&s;t mea&s;ure of per|fection in it is that of the Pillars, which though full of

maje&s;ty in their height and compa&s;&s;e, have yet an ornament added to them, more maje&s;ticall then the maje&s;ty, for upon each of them (there are four ranks of them in all) are fa&s;tned four Tables, which take up their whole circle, every Table being in length two yards or thereabout. In every of the&s;e, are the pictures of &s;undry men and women of the better qua|lity, &s;o exactly limmed, that neither a curious eye could de|&s;ire, nor a cunning hand di&s;charge it better. The&s;e Tables are the Monuments and Tombs of the Burgers of the City, or of the noble&s;t of the Countrey nigh unto it; who in them have cau&s;ed their pictures to be drawn with as great art and &s;tate as co&s;t could procure them, and in a &s;ub&s;cription of golden letters, have eternized their names and that act to all &s;ucceeding po&s;terity. So that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of the &s;um|ptuou&s;ne&s;&s;e of this Church, what the Hi&s;torian doth of the Temple of <HI>Delphos, Multa igitur ibi, &amp; opulenta regum populorumque vi&s;untur munera; quaeque magnificentia &s;ui, reddentium vota gratam voluntatem manife&s;tant.</HI> Neitheir have the&s;e Sepulchrall or|naments been of any great &s;tanding; the antiente&s;t of them which I could ob&s;erve having been erected &s;ince the year 1570. Add to the&s;e the curious works which the ingraver hath cut in the main wals, and then you perhaps will fall into the &s;ame exta&s;ie that I did, and pick a quarell with nature and the heavens, that they had not made you all into an eye.</P>
<P>In this Church, as in others al&s;o of this party, be|&s;ides the high Altar in the midde&s;t of the Quire, there are divers others in the private Clo&s;&s;ets, which are de|&s;tinate to the mumbling of their low Ma&s;&s;es. Of the&s;e there are in number 24. all of them &s;eated between the two outermo&s;t rankes of pillars and the wals; prety neat places, and it is pity they &s;hould be abu&s;ed to &s;uch Idolatries. Of three of them I took e&s;peciall notice, they being indeed the chiefe&s;t of the re&s;t, either for furni|ture or u&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them was that of the Virgin, which was divided from the re&s;t of the Church by a &s;phere made of wood, which reached unto the tops of the parti|tition.

On the out&s;ide the Planets, Starres and Con|&s;tellations were mo&s;t artificially &s;et down in their pro|per orbes, with the times of ab&s;olving their &s;everall cour&s;es. On the in&s;ide, tho&s;e &s;paces were filled up with a pack of Ver&s;es in commendation of our Lady. The Altar there, was for matter and making, the mo&s;t glori|ous that ever I yet looked upon; that on the other &s;ide in the Quire, and over which is the image of our Sa|viour, being more de&s;picable then were fit for the credite of a Village. Over this Altar was the Virgins Status, all gilt, and of a full and wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anly proportion; two Angels of the &s;ame materials attending on her. Finally, this Chappell con&s;idering the richne&s;&s;e and glory of it, may be &s;tyled the <HI>Epitome of the Church;</HI> that attribute of <HI>Immen&s;ae opulentiae Templum,</HI> being no more de&s;ervedly ap|plyable to <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, of which <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;pake it, then to this.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of them, &s;tood as I remember <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the further end of the Church behind the Quire, not di|rected for ought I could perceive to any particular Saint, yet not to be pa&s;&s;ed over without a due remem|brance. It was &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Church by two ranks of br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e pillars, one rank above the o|ther. The pillars all curiou&s;ly ca&s;ted, and &s;uch as would not &s;hame the workman. In this Ma&s;&s;ing Closet over the Altar there was hanged a tablet, which by the many lines and &s;hadowes drawn in it, &s;eemed to repre&s;ent &s;ome piece of building. Moving my hand towards mine eye in the nature and kind of a Per&s;pective gla&s;&s;e, I per|ceived it to be the repre&s;entation of that Church in which I &s;tood to &s;ee it; and it was done with that cun|ning, that it would almo&s;t have per&s;waded a man out of him&s;elf, and made him believe, that he had been in the Church yard. So perfectly did it &s;hew the maje&s;ty of the Front, the beauty of the Iles, the number of the Pillars, and the glory of the Quire. A kinde of work, in mine opinion of all others the mo&s;t excellent, and &s;uch as would infinitely delight an optick. Had not

<P>The third of the&s;e Ma&s;&s;ing clo&s;ets was that of St. <HI>Pe|ter,</HI> not &s;o gorgeous as the re&s;t unto the eyes of them that &s;aw it, but more u&s;efull to the &s;ouls of tho&s;e, who had a minde to take the benefit of it. For therein hung an indulgence granted by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the fifteenth unto that Church; Dated the 27 of <HI>July, anno</HI> 1622. and of his Popedome the &s;econd. The contents of it were an ab&s;olute exemption from the paines and place of Pur|gatory to tho&s;e, who upon the Fea&s;t of <HI>Al-&s;oules (Fe|&s;tum commemorationis defunctorum,</HI> the brief calleth it) and the <HI>Octaves</HI> of it; would come to pay their devotions and moneyes, in that Temple. Had the extent of it been generall, it would quickly have emptied the Popes Trea&s;ury; and in time have put an end to Purga|tory. His Holine&s;&s;e therefore did wi&s;ely re&s;train it in his Bull, to the natives of that Dioce&s;&s;e. The Author and fir&s;t founder of this granting of Indulgences (if it be lawfull to note &s;o much by the way) was Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the &s;econd, who began his Popedome <HI>anno</HI> 1088. who conferred them upon all &s;uch as would goe unto the warres for the recovering of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> next they began to be conferred on tho&s;e, who would &s;ide with the Pope, in his unlawfull warres again&s;t the Emperours. And fa&s;tly, about the time of <HI>Clement</HI> the fifth (he began his reign <HI>anno</HI> 1306) they began to be merchantable; for to him that gainfull invention of the Church Trea&s;ury, con&s;i&s;ting of the merits of our Saviour and the Saints is imputed.

<P><HI>JUly</HI> the 30. we took boat to go down to <HI>Abbeville,</HI> by the river of <HI>Some;</HI> a river of no great breadth, but deep and full; the boat which carryed us was much of the making of tho&s;e Lighters which live upon the Thames, but that is was made more wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ldie and fit for &s;peed. There were in it of us in all, to the number of 30 per&s;ons or thereabouts: people of all conditions, and &s;uch with whom a man of any humor might have found a companion.

Thus a&s;&s;ociated, we pa&s;&s;ed merrily down the &s;treame, though &s;lowly; the delight which our lan|guage gave the companie, and the content which their liberal humanity afforded to us, beguiling the tediou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the way.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we met with ob&s;ervable, was the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Piquigni.</HI> The Town poor and beggerly, and &s;o unlikely to have named the Province; as <HI>Mercator</HI> would have it; be&s;ides the di&s;proportion and di&s;&s;imilitude of the names. The Ca&s;tle &s;ituate on the top of the hill, is now a place of more plea&s;ure then &s;trength, as having command over an open and goodly Countrey, which lyeth below it. It belongeth as we have &s;aid, to the <HI>Vid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">te</HI> of <HI>Amiens;</HI> and &s;o doth the Town al&s;o. This Town is famous among the <HI>French</HI> for a Tradition and a truth, the Tradition is of a famous defeat given unto the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> near unto it; but in who&s;e reign, and under who&s;e conduct, they could not tell us. Being thus routed, they fled to this Town, into which their enemies followed with them, intending to put them all to the &s;word: but at la&s;t their fury being allaied, they propo&s;ed that mercy to them, which tho&s;e of <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">ad</HI> did unto tho&s;e of <HI>Ephraim</HI> in the Scriptures: life and liberty being promi&s;ed to all them which could pronounce this word <HI>Piquigni.</HI> It &s;eemeth it was not in tho&s;e dayes a word po&s;&s;ible for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mouth; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;aying all of them <HI>Pequenie</HI> in &s;tead of <HI>Piquigni,</HI> were all of them put to the &s;word: thus far the Tradition. The Truth of &s;tory, by which this Town is famous in the writers of both Nati|ons, is an enterview here given betwixt our <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and their <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. upon the concluding of their nine years truce. A circum&s;tance of no great moment of it &s;elf, had not <HI>Philip de Comines</HI> made it &s;uch by one of his own ob&s;er|vations. Upon this meeting the Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> being Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> made an oration to both Kings, begin|ning

<P>The next place of note that the water conveied us to, was the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Pont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d' Arme:</HI> a place now &s;carce vi&s;ible in the ruines, and belonging to one Mr. <HI>Quercy.</HI> It took name, as they &s;ay, from a bridge here built for the tran&s;portation of an Army; but this I cannot ju&s;tifie. Three leagues down the river is the Town of <HI>Abbeville;</HI> a Town conveniently &s;eated on the <HI>Some,</HI> which runneth through it. It is of greater circuite within the wals, then the City of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and hath four Pari&s;h Churches more then it; but is not &s;o beautifull, nor &s;o populous. For the hou&s;es here are of an older &s;tampe, and there is within the Town no &s;carcity of wa&s;t ground. I went round about the wals, and ob|&s;erved the thinne&s;s of the hou&s;es, &amp; the largene&s;s of the fields, which are of that capacity and extent, that for ought I could apprehend, the Town need never fear to be compelled by famine, if tho&s;e fields were husbanded to the be&s;t advantages. The wals are of earth within and &s;tone without, of an un|equall breadth, and in &s;ome places ruinous. A Ca&s;tle it once had, of which there is now &s;carce any thing remaining. In &s;tead of which, and in places more convenient, they built out
<PB N="187" REF="118">
three Ba&s;tions, very large and capacious; and &s;uch well man|ned need not yeeld upon a &s;ummons. There are al&s;o a couple of mounts rai&s;ed nigh unto the wall, at that place where the Countrey is mo&s;t plain, upon which good Ordinance would have good command; but at this time there were none upon it. Without the wals it is diver&s;ly &s;trengthned, having in &s;ome places a deep ditch without water, in &s;ome a &s;hallower ditch but well filled by the bene|fit of the river, in others only a moori&s;h and fennie levell, more dangerous to the enemie, and &s;ecure to the Town, then either of the re&s;t, and therefore never guarded by the Souldiers of the Garri&s;on. But the chief &s;trength of it, is five Companies of <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> 100 in a company, proper tall fel|lowes in appearance, and &s;uch as one would imagine fit for the &s;ervice. It was my chance to &s;ee them begin their watch; to which imployment they advanced with &s;o good order, and &s;uch a &s;hew of &s;tomach, as if they had not gone to guard a Town, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e one. Their watch was at <HI>Porte de Boyes,</HI> and <HI>Porte St. Valery;</HI> the fir&s;t lying near un-<HI>He&s;ain</HI> a frontier Town of <HI>Artoys;</HI> the other five leagues on|ly from the Sea and Haven of St. <HI>Valery.</HI> From tho&s;e places mo&s;t danger was feared, and therefore there kept mo&s;t of their Souldiers, and all their Ordinance. Their Captain is named Mr. <HI>Aill&egrave;</HI> a <HI>Gri&s;on</HI> by birth, and reported for a good Souldier. Be&s;ides him they have no Military Commander; the Maior of the Town, contrary to the nature of Towns of war, being there in highe&s;t authority. A priviledge granted unto the Maiors hereof, not long &s;ince, as a reward due to one of their integrities, who under&s;tanding that the Gover|nour of the Town held intelligence with the <HI>Arch-duke;</HI> apprehended him and &s;ent him to the Court, where he re|ceived his puni&s;hment. This <HI>Abbeville</HI> (and &s;o I leave it, and in it my bevie of <HI>French</HI> la&s;&s;es) is &s;o called <HI>qua&s;i Abbatis Villa,</HI> as formerly belonging to the Abbot of it.</P>
<P>And yet before I leave this Town, I mu&s;t needs take notice of an Adventure, which might have proved prejudi|ciall to me, if my good fortune had not overcome all con|trary accidents. My companions had no &s;ooner landed out of the boat which brought us from <HI>Amiens,</HI> but pre&s;ently
<PB N="188" REF="119">
they betook them&s;elves to the Po&s;t-hou&s;e without the Town, that they might be ready for <HI>Bologne</HI> the next morning. But I who did not think that I was to make &s;uch a gollopping journey thorow <HI>France,</HI> as the fooli&s;h traveller affirmed he had made thorow <HI>Venice,</HI> re&s;olved to &s;atisfie my &s;elf in all tho&s;e particulars which I found capable of note and ob&s;ervation. Which having done, and thinking I had &s;till day enough for my curio&s;ities, I betook my &s;elf to the <HI>Corps du guard,</HI> where being &s;oon known to be a Gentleman of <HI>England,</HI> I ea&s;ily obtained leave to walk round about the works of the Town, and to ob&s;erve the &s;ituation, &s;trength, and defences of it. But &s;o it hapned that before I came to the gate which led towards the Po&s;t-hou&s;e, I found in newly locked up by the Captain of the watch &s;on that night, and thought I might have found pa&s;&s;age at the next gate, had I ha&s;tned towards it; yet I was &s;o taken up with the orderly march of the Guards, being all proper followes and well ap|pointed, that before I came to that gate, it was locked up al&s;o: which being the two only gates on that &s;ide of the River, deprived me of all ordinary meane to come that night to my Companions, who were re&s;olved to be on hor&s;e back the next morning by the break of day. I had now liberty enough to traver&s;e and con&s;ult the &s;treets, within which I &s;eemed to be impri&s;oned, but could meet none that could informe me how to free my &s;elf out of that re&s;traint; at la&s;t I met with and old Burger of a comely pre&s;ence, who I thought promi&s;ed better &s;atisfaction then the re&s;t had given me; who being acquainted with my de&s;ire of uniting my &s;elf with my companions, and the difficulty which my curio&s;ity had brought upon me, di|rected me to the hou&s;e of the Provo&s;t, who, as he told me, had the keeping of a Water gate under one of the Arches of the wall by which the River pa&s;&s;ed thorow the Town, by which I might finde a way out of it, if I could wooe him to make u&s;e of his priviledge in that point, which he thought hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible to be effected. Well, to the Provo&s;ts hou&s;e I went, whom I &s;ound at home, acquainted him that I came with Letters from
<PB N="189" REF="119">
the Court of <HI>England,</HI> that I was returning thither with my di&s;patches, that my companions being le&s;&s;e curious then my &s;elf, had pre&s;ently betook them&s;elves to their lodgings without the Town, that it would be a great reproach to me, if I &s;hould not be in <HI>England</HI> as &s;oon as they, and there|fore humbly did be&s;eech him (in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> good <HI>French</HI> as I could) that he would be my means no &s;et me on the other &s;ide of the River without the Town, which I un|der&s;tood to be in his power. To this reque&s;t he yeelded with a great de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l of chearfulne&s;&s;e, a&s;&s;uring me that he thought him&s;elf exceeding happy in having opportunity of doing any acceptable &s;ervice to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman: which &s;aid, he pre&s;ently di&s;patched a &s;ervant for his <HI>Bayliffe delleaw,</HI> or Water Bailiffe (being a &s;worn officer of the Town) to attend upon him, and in the mean time enter|tained him&s;elf with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es as I was able to make him of the Queens reception. News being brought that the Water Bailiffe was coming forwards, he conducted me into a low Parlor very hand&s;omely furni&s;hed, where I found a Banquet or Collation provided for me, con&s;i&s;ting of cold bake-meats, choi&s;e Marmelets, and mo&s;t excellent Wines, and (which I looked upon as the greater favour) his Wife and Daughters ready for my entertainment. We had &s;carce ended this refre&s;hment, when the Bailiff brought word that he had made a boat ready to carry me to the Water-gate; whereupon having had the honor to ki&s;&s;e the hands of the women, I made accompt to take my leave of the Provo&s;t al&s;o, who on the other &s;ide was re|&s;olved to accompany me to the water &s;ide, and not to leave me till he &s;aw me pa&s;&s;ed thorow the gate (whether out of civility to me, or compliance with the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, I determine not) which was done accordingly; one of his &s;ervants waiting on me till he had brought me to the Inne where I was to lodge.</P>

<P>WE are now come to the County of <HI>Boulonnois,</HI> which though a part of <HI>Picardie,</HI> di&s;daineth yet to be &s;o accounted, but will be reckoned as a County of it &s;elf.

Neither is it only a County of it &s;elf, but it is in a manner al&s;o a free County, it being holden
<PB N="193" REF="121">
immediately of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who is, no que&s;tion, a very gracious Landladie. For when King <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. after the decea&s;e of <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> had taken in <HI>Boulogne, anno</HI> 1477. as new Lord of the Town (thus <HI>John de Serres</HI> rela|teth it) he did homage without Sword or Spurs, bare-headed and on his knee, before the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> offering unto her Image an heart of ma&s;&s;ie gold, weighing 2000 crowns. He added al&s;o this, that he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors Kings after him, &s;hould hold the County of <HI>Boulogne</HI> of the &s;aid Virgin, and do homage unto her image in the great Church of the higher Town dedicated to her name, paying at every change of a Va&s;&s;all an heart of pure gold of the &s;ame weight. Since that time, the <HI>Boulonnois</HI> being the Tenants of our Lady, have en|joyed a perpetuall exemption from many of tho&s;e Tributes and Taxes, under which the re&s;t of <HI>France</HI> is mi&s;erably afflicted. Among&s;t others they have been alwayes freed from the Gabell of Salt; by rea&s;on whereof, and by the goodne&s;&s;e of their Pa&s;tures, they have there the be&s;t butter in all the Kingdome. I &s;aid partly by rea&s;on of their &s;alt, becau&s;e having it at a low rate, they do liberally &s;ea&s;on all their Butter with it; whereas they which buy their Salt at the Kings price, cannot afford it any of that deer commodity: upon this ground it is the cu&s;tome of the&s;e of <HI>Boulonnois</HI> to &s;end unto their friends of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> a barrell of Butter &s;ea&s;oned according to their fa&s;hion; a pre&s;ent no le&s;&s;e ordinary and acceptable, then Turkies, Capons, and the like, are from our Countrey Gentlemen to tho&s;e of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Town of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> it is divided into two parts, <HI>La haute Ville,</HI> and <HI>La ba&s;&s;e Ville,</HI> or the high Town, and the low Town, di&s;tant one from the other above an hundred paces, and upwards. The high Town is &s;eated upon the top of an hill; the low Town upon the declivity of it, and towards the Haven. Or el&s;e we may divide it into other parts, <HI>viz.</HI> the Town, and the City; the Town that towards the water, and the City that which lyeth above it. It was made a City in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. <HI>anno</HI> 1553. at which time the City of <HI>Terovenne</HI> was totally ruined by the Impe|rials, and the Bi&s;hops &s;eat was removed hither; the Church
<PB N="194" REF="122">
of <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> being made the Cathedrall. There came along hither, upon the remove of the Bi&s;hop, 20 Canons, which number is here &s;till retained, their revenue being about 1000 Livres yearly. As for the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop, his name is <HI>Pierre d' Arm&egrave;,</HI> his intrado 2000 Livres, his <HI>Metropolitan</HI> he of <HI>Rhemes.</HI> The Town, or as they call it, the low Town, is bigger then the City, and better built, the &s;treets larger, and the people richer, mo&s;t of the Merchants living in it, becau&s;e it lyeth upon the Haven.</P>
<P>But that which made this low Town mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me, was a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion that pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets of it, intending to pacifie Gods anger, and divert the plague, which at that time was in the City. In the fir&s;t front there was carried the Cro&s;&s;e, and after that the holy or &s;anctified Ban|ner; next unto it followed all the Prie&s;ts of the Town bare-headed, and in their Surplices, &s;inging as they went the Services de&s;tinate to that occa&s;ion. After them followed the men, and next to them the women of the Town, by two and two, it being &s;o ordered by the <HI>Roman Rituall, U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> laici a clericis, foeminae a viris pro&s;equantur &s;e paratae.</HI> On the other &s;ide of the &s;treet went the Brethren <HI>De la Charit&egrave;,</HI> every one of them holding in his hand a little triangular Banner, or a Pennon; after them the boyes and wenches. In this method did they mea&s;ure &s;olemnly every lane and angle of the Town; the Prie&s;ts &s;inging, and ill the people an&s;wering them in the &s;ame note. At the Church they began it with prayers, and having vi&s;ited all the Town, they returned again thither to end it with the &s;ame devotion. An action very grave and &s;olemn, and &s;uch as I could well allow of, were it not only for one prayer which is alwayes &s;aid at the time of this performance, and the addition of the Banners. The Prayer is this: <HI>Exaudi nos Deus &s;alutaris no&s;ter, &amp; intercedente beata &amp; glorio&s;a Viigine, &amp; beato Seba&s;ti|ano Martyre tuo</HI> (this <HI>Sebastian</HI> is their <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> or tutelary Saint again&s;t the Sickne&s;&s;e) <HI>&amp; omnibus Sanctis; populum tuum ab iracundiae tuae terroribus libera, &amp; mi&s;ericordiae tuae fac largi|tate &s;ecurum, Amen.</HI> This only excepted, there is nothing in all the liturgie of it, which can be offen&s;ive to any con|&s;cience, not idlely &s;crupulous.&mdash;The&s;e Proce&s;&s;ions
<PB N="195" REF="122">
were fir&s;t in&s;tituted by Pope <HI>Stephanus</HI> II. who began his Popedome <HI>anno</HI> 752. the intent of them, as <HI>Platina</HI> reporteth it, <HI>Ad placandam Dei iram.</HI> The fir&s;t place that ever they went to in proce&s;&s;ion, was the Church of our Lady in the Shambles; or <HI>Ad &s;anctam Dei genitricem ad prae&s;epe,</HI> as the Hi&s;toriian calleth them. As for the Letany, which is a principall part of it, it was fir&s;t compiled by <HI>Mamercus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Daulphine,</HI> in the time of Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the fir&s;t, which was 308 years before the time of <HI>Stephanus.</HI> The motive of it, was the often danger to which <HI>France</HI> was &s;ubject, by rea&s;on of the frequency of Earth-quakes. Since tho&s;e beginnings, which were fair and commendable, the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church hath added much to them of magnificence, and &s;omewhat of impiety, and pro&s;anene&s;&s;e. As for the Bre|thren <HI>De la Charit&egrave;,</HI> I could not learn any thing of their originall, but much of their Office; for they are bound to vi&s;it all &s;uch as are infected with the Plague, to mini&s;ter unto them all things nece&s;&s;ary, and if they die, to &s;hrowde them and carry them to their graves. The&s;e duties they per|forme very willingly, as being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this fancie, that they are priviledged from contagion, by virtue of their Order. And to &s;ay the truth, they are mo&s;t of them old, and &s;o le&s;&s;e &s;ubject to it; and indeed &s;uch &s;aple&s;&s;e, thin, un|bodied fellowes, that one would think almo&s;t no di&s;ea&s;e could catch them. Yet hath their prerogative not always held to them; of 33 of them in <HI>Calice,</HI> three only &s;urviving the di&s;ea&s;e, about four yeers &s;ince. But were the danger to which them&s;elves are liable, all the inconveniency of it, I &s;hould not much di&s;allow it. There is a greater mi&s;chief waiteth upon it, and that is, the infecting of others; they immediately after their return from the Pe&s;t hou&s;e, mix|ing them&s;elves with any of their neighbours. A mo&s;t &s;peedy means to &s;pread the Pe&s;tilence, where it is once begun; though neither they nor the people will be per|&s;waded to it.</P>
<P>The City or the high Town, &s;tandeth, as we have &s;aid, on the top of the hill, environed with deep ditches, a &s;trong wall, and clo&s;ed with a treble gate and two draw-bridges. A little &s;mall Town it is, not much above a flights &s;hot
<PB N="196" REF="123">
thwart, where it is wide&s;t; and hath in it but one Church be&s;ides that of <HI>No&s;tre Dame,</HI> which is Cathedrall. The &s;treets not many, and tho&s;e narrow, unle&s;&s;e it be in the Market-place, where the <HI>Corpus du Guarde</HI> is kept. What the outworks are, or whether it have any or no, I cannot &s;ay. Even in this time of League and Peace, their jealou&s;ie will not permit an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man to walke their wals, either within or without the Town. A Ca&s;tle they &s;aid that it hath; but &s;uch a one as &s;erveth more for a dwelling then a Fort. The Garri&s;on of this Town con&s;i&s;teth of five Com|panies, 60 in a Company, which amount in all to 300: their Governour being Mr. <HI>D' Aumont,</HI> &s;on to the Mar&s;hall <HI>D' Au|mont;</HI> who &s;o faithfully adhered to <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in the begin|ning of his troubles. The cau&s;e why this Town being &s;o &s;mall, is &s;o &s;trongly Garri&s;oned; is the &s;afe keeping of the Haven which is under it, and the command of the pa&s;&s;age from the Haven up into the Countrey. The fir&s;t of the &s;er|vices it can hardly performe, without much injury to the low Town, which &s;tandeth between them: but for the ready di&s;charge of the la&s;t, it is daintily &s;eated, for though to &s;pare the low Town, they &s;hould permit an enemie to land; yet as &s;oon as he is in his march up into the higher Countrey, their Ordinance will tear him into pieces.</P>
<P>But for the immediate &s;ecurity of the Haven, their An|ce&s;tors did u&s;e to fortifie the old Tower, &s;tanding on the top of the hill, called <HI>La tour d'ordre.</HI> It is &s;aid to have been built by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> at the time of his &s;econd expedition into <HI>Britaine;</HI> this Haven being then named <HI>Portus Ge&s;&s;oriacus.</HI> This Tower which we now &s;ee, &s;eemeth to be but the re|mainder of a greater work; and by the height and &s;ituati|on of it, one would gue&s;&s;e it to have been the <HI>Keepe</HI> or <HI>Watch-tower</HI> unto the re&s;t. It is built of rude and vulgar &s;tone, but &s;trongly cemented together, the figure of it is &s;ix &s;quare, every &s;quare of it being nine paces in length. A compa&s;&s;e too little for a Fortre&s;&s;e, and therefore it is long &s;ince it was put to that u&s;e; it now &s;erving only as a Sea|marke by day, and a <HI>Pharos</HI> by night; <HI>Ubi aecen&s;ae noctu faces navigantium cur&s;um dirigunt.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man calleth it, <HI>The old
<PB N="197" REF="123">
man of Boulogne,</HI> and not improperly, for it hath all the &s;ignes of age upon it. The Sea by undermining it, hath taken from it all the earth about two &s;quares of the bottom of it; the &s;tones begin to drop out from the top, and upon the lea&s;t ri&s;ing of the wind, you would think it were troubled with the Pal&s;ie. In a word, two hard Winters, &s;econded with a violent tempe&s;t, maketh it rubbi&s;h; what therefore is wan|ting of pre&s;ent &s;trength to the Haven in this ruine of a Tower, the wi&s;dome of this age hath made good in the Garri&s;on. And here me thinks I might ju&s;tly accu&s;e the im|politick thrift of our former Kings of <HI>England</HI> in not laying out &s;ome money upon the &s;trength and &s;afety of our Haven Towns: not one of them, <HI>Porte&s;m uth</HI> only excepted, being Garri&s;oned. True it is, that <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. did erect Block-hou&s;es in many of them; but what bables they are, and how unable to re&s;i&s;t a Fleet royally appointed, is known to e|very one. I know, indeed, we were &s;ufficiently garri&s;oned by our Navy, could it either keep a watch on all particular places, or had it not &s;ometimes occa&s;ion to be ab&s;ent I hope our Kings are not of <HI>Darius</HI> mind in the &s;tory, <HI>Qui glorio&s;ius ratus e&s;t ho&s;tem repellere quam non admittere;</HI> neither will I take upon me, to give coun&s;ell; only I could wi&s;h that we were not inferior to our neighbours, in the greatne&s;&s;e of our care; &s;ince we are equall to the be&s;t of them in the goodne&s;&s;e of our Countrey.</P>
<P>But though the old man was too old to performe this &s;ervice, or to contribute any thing toward the defence of the Town and Haven, yet I conceived my &s;elf obliged to give him a vi&s;ite; partly out of the reverent e&s;teem which I had of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> but principally that I might from thence take a full view of my deare&s;t <HI>England,</HI> from which for want of winde and Company, I was then re|&s;trained. With the&s;e de&s;ires I made a boy of the Inne ac|quainted, who told me that there was no way but by the Pe&s;t-hou&s;es from the Town to the Tower, and that if we were noted to walke that way, we &s;hould both be pre&s;ently &s;hut up as infected per&s;ons, or committed to the cu&s;tody of the <HI>Brethren of Charity,</HI> the wor&s;t condition
<PB N="198" REF="124">
of the two. But finding the impatiencie of my de&s;ires not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, and the temptation of a <HI>Quart d' e&s;cue,</HI> not to be re&s;i&s;ted; he told me that if I would venture to climb up the Rocks, as he and other boyes of the Town u&s;ed to do &s;ometimes, he would undertake to bring me thither. This offer I readily accepted, and as &s;oon as the tide was low enough for us, we began our walke upon the <HI>Beach</HI> till we came to the bottom of the Rocks where the old man dwelt, and pre&s;ently we began to mount, as if we meant to take the Fortre&s;&s;e by Scalado. I found the way more trouble&s;ome and dan|gerous then I had conceived, and my &s;elf before I came halfe way towards the top, which &s;eemed &s;till to be farther of then it was at the fir&s;t, &s;o vexed and brui&s;ed, that I began to be amazed at my own fool-hardine&s;&s;e, and was many times in a minde to de&s;cend again; and que&s;ti|onle&s;&s;e I had done accordingly, if a re&s;olution of not giving over any enterpri&s;e which I was engaged in, and a fear lea&s;t the boy would laugh at me when we came to the Town, had not pu&s;hed me on. Having breathed our &s;elves a while, we advanced again. The old <HI>cripple</HI> who is fabled to have &s;tolen <HI>Pauls</HI> weather-cock, u&s;ed not more pains and cunning in climbing to the top of that lofty &s;teeple, then we in mounting to the top of the&s;e mighty Rocks; which when we had attained at la&s;t, me thought I was much of the &s;ame humor with old <HI>Tom</HI> of <HI>Odcombe</HI> on the top of the <HI>Alpes,</HI> of whom the Poet hath informed us:</P>
<LG>
<L>That to the top at la&s;t being got,</L>
<L>With very much adoe god wot;</L>
<L>He eagerly de&s;ired,</L>
<L>That mighty <HI>Jove</HI> would take the pains</L>
<L>To da&s;h out their unworthy brains,</L>
<L>Who offered to be tired.</L>
</LG>
<P>No &s;ooner had my eyes got above the height of the Cliffes, but the fir&s;t &s;ight I met with was a row of Pe&s;t-hou&s;es
<PB N="199" REF="124">
not far di&s;tant, and &s;ome old women drying the in&s;ected cloathes on a bank adjoyning; the &s;ight whereof had almo&s;t made me recoil backward with more ha&s;t then &s;peed. But having overcome the danger of that apprehen&s;ion, I fir&s;t &s;aluted the old man, taking full no|tice of his great &s;tature, old age, and many infirmities. That done, I turned my face toward <HI>England,</HI> which afforded me a mo&s;t plea&s;ing object; the cour&s;e thereof lying with|in my view at &s;o great a length, that one might ea&s;ily di&s;cerne from <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle Ea&s;tward, to the We&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex:</HI> an object of &s;o rich contentment and &s;o full of ravi&s;hing contemplations, that I was almo&s;t of his mind who &s;aid <HI>Bonum e&s;t nobis e&s;&s;e hic;</HI> and certainly I had dwelt there longer, if the boy had not put me in mind that the flood was coming back amain (as indeed it was) and that if we made not &s;peed to recover the Town before it was got near the foot of the Rocks, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be fain to abide there the greate&s;t part of the night till the ebb en&s;uing. On this adverti&s;ement; there was no need to bid me ha&s;ten: but then a new humor &s;eized upon me, when I beheld tho&s;e dreadfull precipices, which I was to de&s;cend, together with the infinite di&s;tance of the Beach from the top of the Rocks; the danger of being &s;hut up by the &s;ea, if we made not ha&s;t, and of tumbling into it if we did. But as curio&s;ity had carryed me up, &s;o nece&s;&s;ity brought me down again, with greater &s;afety, I confe&s;&s;e, then I had de&s;erved.

<P>This Town of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> and the Countrey about it, was taken by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. of <HI>England, anno</HI> 1545. him&s;elf being in per&s;on at the &s;iege; a very co&s;tly and charge|able victory. The whole li&s;t of his Forces did amount to 44000 Foot, and 3000 Hor&s;e; Field pieces he drew after him above 100 be&s;ides tho&s;e of &s;maller making: and for the conveyance of their Ordinance, Baggage and other provi&s;ion, there were tran&s;ported into the Continent,

above 25000 hor&s;es. True it is, that his de&s;ignes had a further aime, had not <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor, with whm he was to joyne, left the field and made peace without him. So that, judging only by the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the expedi|tion, we cannot but &s;ay, that the winning of <HI>Boulon|nois</HI> was a deer purcha&s;e. And indeed in this one par|ticular Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> in the Preface to his mo&s;t ex|cellent Hi&s;tory &s;aith not ami&s;&s;e of him; namely, <HI>That in his vain and fruitle&s;&s;e expeditions abroad, he con&s;umed more trea&s;ure, then all the re&s;t of our Victorious Kings before him did in their &s;everall Conque&s;ts.</HI> The other part of his cen&s;ure concerning that Prince, I know not well what to think of, as meerly compo&s;ed of gall and bitterne&s;&s;e. Onely I cannot but much marvell, that a man of his wi&s;dome, be|ing rai&s;ed from almo&s;t nothing by the daughter, could be &s;o &s;everely invective again&s;t the Father; certainly a mo&s;t charitable Judge cannot but condemne him of want of true affection and duty to his Queen: &s;eeing that it is as his late Maje&s;ty hath excellently noted in his <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>A thing mon&s;trous to &s;ee a man love the childe, and bate the Parents;</HI> and therefore he earne&s;tly en|joyneth his &s;on <HI>Henry, To repre&s;&s;e the in&s;olence of &s;uch as un|der pretence to taxe a vice in the per&s;on &s;eek craftily to stain the race.</HI></P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after this taking of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> a|gain endevoured their gaining of it, even during the life of the Conquerour; but he was &s;trong enough to keep his gettings. After his death, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being engaged in a war again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Ket</HI> having rai&s;ed a re|bellion in <HI>Norfolke,</HI> they began to hope a Conque&s;t of it, and that more violently then ever. Upon news of their preparations, an Emba&s;&s;ador was di&s;patched to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, to de&s;ire &s;uccor of him, and to lay before him the infancy and &s;everall nece&s;&s;ities of the young King, who was then about the age of ten years. This de&s;ire when the Emperour had refu&s;ed to hearken to, they be&s;ought him, that he would at the lea&s;t be plea&s;ed to take into his hands and keeping, the Town

Yet did he not only deny to &s;atisfie the King in this, except he would re&s;tore the Catholick religion; but he al&s;o expre&s;ly commanded that neither his men or munition, &s;hould go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> An ingratitude, for which I cannot finde a fitting epithite; confidering what fa&s;t friends the Kings of <HI>England</HI> had alwayes been to the united hou&s;es of <HI>Burgundie</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> what moneys they have helped them with, and what &s;un|dry Warres they have made for them, both in <HI>Belgium</HI> to maintain their Authority, and in <HI>France</HI> to augment their potencie.</P>

Upon this deniall of the un|mindfull Emperour, a Treaty followed betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> The effect of it was, that <HI>Boulogne,</HI> and all the Countrey of it &s;hould be re&s;tored to the <HI>French,</HI> they paying unto the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> at two dayes of pay|ment 800000 Crownes.

<P>I am now at the point of leaving <HI>Boulogne,</HI> but mu&s;t fir&s;t reckon with mine Ho&s;t, to whom we were growne into arrears &s;ince our fir&s;t coming thither.

<PB N="202" REF="126">
for us, it would not have brought us to this Town, &s;o that our Ho&s;t was fain to furni&s;h us with &s;ome mo|nies to make even with him. After which &s;taying there from Sunday noon to Wedne&s;day morning, and being then fain to make u&s;e of his credit al&s;o to provide of a Boat for <HI>England</HI> (which alone &s;tood us in three pound) our engagements grew greater then he had any ju&s;t rea&s;on to adventure on us. But being an ingenuous man, and &s;eeing that we fared well, &s;pent freely, and for the mo&s;t part entertained him and his family at our table, he was the le&s;&s;e diffident of payment, as he told me after|wards. Having &s;tayed three dayes for Company, and none appearing, we were fain to hire a boat expre&s;&s;e for my companion and my &s;elf to pa&s;&s;e over in. In order whereunto, I told him of our pre&s;ent condition, a&s;&s;ured him that we had friends in <HI>Dover</HI> who would &s;upply us with all things nece&s;&s;ary (as indeed we had) that ha|ving &s;ummed up what we owed him, and what he had contracted for our pa&s;&s;age over, he &s;hould have a note under our hands for the payment of it, and that one of us &s;hould remain pri&s;oner in the Boat till the other rai&s;ed money to redeem him. To which he an&s;wered, that we had carryed our &s;elves like Gentlemen, which gave him no di&s;tru&s;t of a reall payment; that he would take if we plea&s;ed a Bill of our hands for the money to be paid in <HI>Dover;</HI> and de&s;ired that we would give him leave to &s;end over a &s;ervant in our Boat with a basket of poultery, who &s;hould receive the money of us and give back our Bond. This being agreed upon, the next mor|ning we took boat for <HI>England,</HI> the Mariners knowing nothing el&s;e, but that the &s;ervant went over only to &s;ell his Poultery (that being an opportunity frequently in|dulged by them unto tho&s;e of the Town) though we knew well enough he went on another errand; and as we could not but commend my Ho&s;t for his courte&s;ie and his care taken of our credit, &s;o we had rea&s;on to e&s;teem our &s;elves in a kinde of cu&s;tody in that he would not let us &s;tir without a Keeper.

<P>Fir&s;t for the Court, we mu&s;t in rea&s;on in the fir&s;t place begin with the per&s;on of the King, without who&s;e influence and pre&s;ence, the Court is but a dead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arka&s;&s;e, void of life and Maje&s;ty. For per&s;on he is of the middle &s;tature, and rather well proportioned then large, his face knoweth little yet of a beard, but that which is black and &s;warty, his com|plexion al&s;o much of the &s;ame hew, carrying in it a certain boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;&s;e, and that in a farther mea&s;ure then what a gracefull maje&s;ty can admit of, &s;o that one can hardly &s;ay of him, without a &s;pite of Court&s;hip, which <HI>Paterculus</HI> did of <HI>Tiberius, Quod vi&s;us praetulerit principem,</HI> that his countenance proclaimed him a King. But que&s;tionle&s;&s;e his greate&s;t defect is want of utterance, which is very unplea&s;ing, by rea&s;on of a de&s;perate and uncurable &s;tammering; which defect is likely more and more to grow upon him. At this time he is aged 24 years and as much as &s;ince the 27 day of la&s;t <HI>September,</HI> which was his birth day; an age which he beareth not very plau|fible; want of beard, and the &s;warthine&s;&s;e of his complexion, making him &s;eem older. At the age of 11 years he was affi|anced to the Lady <HI>Anna</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> by whom as yec he hath no children. It is thought by many, and covertly &s;poken by divers in <HI>France,</HI> that the principall cau&s;e of the Queens barrenne&s;&s;e proceedeth from <HI>Spain;</HI> that people being loath to fall under the <HI>French</HI> obedience, which may very well happen, &s;he being the elde&s;t Si&s;ter of the King. For this cau&s;e in the &s;eventh Article of the marriage, there is a clau&s;e, that neither the &s;aid <HI>Infanta</HI> nor the children born by her (to the King) &s;hall be capable to inherit any of the E&s;tates of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And in the eight Article &s;he is bound to make an Act of Renunciation, under her own hand|writing, as &s;oon as &s;he cometh to be 12 years old, which was accordingly performed. But this being not &s;ufficient to &s;ecure their fears, it is thought, that &s;he was &s;ome way or other di&s;abled from conception before ever &s;he came in|to the Kings imbraces.

to have a <HI>prohibition</HI> from the Parliaments. Of their privi|ledges the chiefe&s;t of the Clergy / men is, the little or no de|pendence upon the Pope, and the little profits they pay unto their King; of the Pope anon; to the King they pay only their Di&s;mes, or Tithes according to the old rate; a &s;mall &s;um if compared unto the payments of their neighbours; it being thought that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> receiveth yearly one half of the living of the Churches; but this I mean of their livings only, for otherwi&s;e they pay the u&s;uall gabels and cu&s;tomes, that are paid by the re&s;t of the Kings liege people. In the generall a&s;&s;embly of the three E&s;tates the Clergy hath authority to elect a &s;et number of Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, to undertake for them and the Church; which Commi&s;&s;ioners do make up the fir&s;t of the three E&s;tates, and do fir&s;t exhibit their grievances and Petitions to the King. In a word, the <HI>French</HI> Church is the free&s;t of any in Chri|&s;tendome, that have not yet quitted their &s;ubjection to the Pope, as alwayes prote&s;ting again&s;t the Inqui&s;itions, not &s;ub|mitting them&s;elves to the Councell of <HI>Trent,</HI> and paying very little to his Holine&s;&s;e, of the plentifull revenue, where|with God and good men have ble&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The number of tho&s;e which the Church Land maintai|neth in <HI>France</HI> is <HI>tantum non</HI> infinite, therefore the Intrado and Revenue of it mu&s;t needs be uncountable. There are numbred in it, as we &s;aid before, 12 Archbi&s;hops, 104 Bi&s;hopricks; to the&s;e add 540 Archpriories, 1450 Abbies, 12320 Priories, 567 Nunneries, 700 Convents of Fryers, 259 Commendames of the order of <HI>Malta,</HI> and 130000 Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts. Yet this is not all, this reckoning was made in the year 1598. Since which time the Je&s;uits have divers Colledges founded for them, and they are known to be none of the poore&s;t. To maintain this large wilderne&s;&s;e of men, the Stati&s;tes of <HI>France,</HI> who have proportioned the Countrey; do allow unto the Clergy almo&s;t a fourth part of the whole.

He made al&s;o another complaint, that the Soveraign Courts by their decrees, had attempted upon the authority which was committed to the Clergy, even in that which meerly concerned Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall di&s;cipline and government of the Church. To the&s;e complaints he gave them, indeed, a very gracious hearing, but it was no further then an hearing, being never followed by redre&s;&s;e. The Court of Parlia|ment knew too well the &s;trength of their own authority, and the King was loath to take from him&s;elf tho&s;e excellent ad|vantages of binding to him&s;elf his Nobility, by the &s;peedy preferring of their children; and &s;o the clergie&punc; departed with a great deal of envy, and a little &s;atisfaction.

<P>His &s;pirituall power is alwayes as little in &s;ub&s;tance, though more in &s;hew; for whereas the Councell of <HI>Trent</HI> hath been an e&s;peciall authorizer of the Popes &s;pirituall &s;upremacy; the <HI>French</HI> Church would never receive it.

But the principall thing in which it behoveth them not to acknowledge his &s;pirituall Supremacy, is the collati|on of Benefices and Bi&s;hopricks, and the Annats and fir&s;t fruits thence ari&s;ing. The fir&s;t and greate&s;t contro|ver&s;ie between the Pope and Princes of Chri&s;tendome, was about the be&s;towing the livings of the Church, and giving the inve&s;ture unto Bi&s;hops; the Popes had long thir&s;ted after that authority, as being a great means to advance their followers, and e&s;tabli&s;h their own great|ne&s;&s;e: for which cau&s;e in divers petty Councels, the re|ceiving of any Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall preferment of a Lay man was enacted to be <HI>Simony.</HI> But this did little edifie with &s;uch patrons as had good livings.

<P N="1">1. That a Councell was above the Pope.</P>

2. That the Pope had no temporall power over Kings, and could not by Excommunication deprive them of their Realm and E&s;tates.</P>
<P N="3">3. That Clergy men having heard of any attempt or con|&s;piracy again&s;t the King or his Realm, or any matter of trea|&s;on in confe&s;&s;ion, he was bound to reveal it.</P>
<P>And 4. That Clergy men were &s;ubject to the &s;ecular Prince or politick Magi&s;trate. It appeared by our former di&s;cour&s;e, what little or no power they had left the Pope over the E&s;tates and preferments of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e Propo&s;itions (to which the Je&s;uites in the end &s;ub&s;cribed, I know not with what mentall re&s;ervation) it is more then evident, that they have left him no command neither over their con&s;ciences, nor their per&s;ons; &s;o that all things con&s;idered, we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of the Papall power in <HI>France,</HI> what the Papi&s;ts &s;aid fal&s;ly of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> namely that it is <HI>Nomen &s;ine rebus.</HI></P>
<P>In one thing only his authority here is intire, which is his immediate protection of all the orders of Fryers, and al&s;o a &s;uperintendency or &s;upreme eye over the Monks, who ac|knowledge very &s;mall obedience, if any at all, to the <HI>French</HI> Bi&s;hops: for though at the beginning every part and mem|ber of the Dioce&s;&s;e, was directly under the care and command of the Bi&s;hop; yet it &s;o happened that at the building of Mona&s;teries in the We&s;tern Church, the Abbots being men of good parts and a &s;incere life, grew much into the envie of their Dioce&s;an. For this cau&s;e, as al&s;o to be more at their own command, they made &s;uit to the Pope that they might be free from that &s;ubjection, <HI>Utque in tutelam divi Petri admit|terentur;</HI> a propo&s;ition very plau&s;ible to his Holine&s;&s;e am|bition, which by this means might the &s;ooner be rai&s;ed to its height; and therefore without difficulty granted. This gap opened, fir&s;t the &s;everall orders of Fryers; and after even the Deans and Chapters, purcha&s;ed to them&s;elves the like exemptions. In this the Popes power was wonderfully &s;trengthned, as having &s;uch able, and &s;o main props to up|hold his authority; it being a true Maxime in State, <HI>Quod qui privilegia obtinent; ad eadem con&s;ervanda tenentur authoritatem concedentis tueri.</HI> This continued till the Councell of <HI>Trent</HI>

unque&s;tioned. Where the Bi&s;hops much complained of their want of authority, and imputed all the Schi&s;mes and Vices in the Church, unto this, that their hands were tyed; hereupon the Popes Legats thought it fit to re&s;tore their ju|ri&s;diction, their Deans and Chapters.

<P>This meer dependence on his Holine&s;&s;e, maketh this gene|ration a great deal more regardle&s;&s;e of their behaviour, then otherwi&s;e it would be: though &s;ince the growth of the Re|formation, &s;hame and fear hath much reformed them, they have &s;till how&s;oever, a &s;pice of their former wantonne&s;&s;e, and on occa&s;ions will permit them&s;elves a little good fellow&s;hip; and to &s;ay truth of them, I think them to be the be&s;t compa|nions in <HI>France</HI> for a journey, but not for acquaintance.

He hath the faire&s;t hou&s;e, and keepeth the large&s;t retinue of any ordi|nary Amba&s;&s;ador in the Realm; and maketh good his Ma&s;ters Supremacies, by his own precedency.

Kings, and then he were &s;ure to have a mo&s;t royall and beg|gerly Court of it.</P>
<P>To proceed a little further in the Allegory, &s;o it is that when <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aw <HI>E&s;au</HI> to have incurred his fathers and mothers anger, for his heatheni&s;h marriage, he &s;et him&s;elf to bereave his elder brother of his ble&s;&s;ing. Prayers, and the &s;weet &s;mell of his Veni&s;on, the &s;weet &s;melling of his &s;acrifices, obtained of his Lord and Father a ble&s;&s;ing for him: for indeed the Lord hath given unto this his <HI>French Jacob,</HI> as it is in the text, <HI>the dew of heaven, and the fatne&s;&s;e of the earth, and plenty of corne and wine, Gen.</HI> 27. 28. It followeth in the 41. <HI>ver&s;.</HI> of the <HI>Chapter. And E&s;au hated Jaeob, becau&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ing wherewith his father had ble&s;&s;ed him; and E&s;au &s;aid in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at band, then will I &s;lay my brother Jacob.</HI> The event of which his bloudy re&s;olution was, that <HI>Jacob</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ain to relinqui&s;h all that he had, and flie unto his Uncle. This la&s;t part of the &s;tory, expre&s;&s;eth very much of the pre&s;ent e&s;tate of the <HI>French</HI> Church. The Papi&s;ts hated the Pro|te&s;tants to &s;ee them thrive and increa&s;e &s;o much among&s;t them. This hatred moved them to a war, by which they hoped to root them out altogether; and this war com|pelled the Prote&s;tants to abandon their good Towns, their &s;trong holds, and all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to flie to their friends where&s;oever they could finde them. And indeed, the pre&s;ent e&s;tate of the Prote&s;tants is not much better then that of <HI>Jacob</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ia,</HI> nor much different. The ble&s;&s;ing which they expect lyeth more in the &s;eed then the harve&s;t. For their &s;trength it con&s;i&s;teth principally in their prayers to God: and &s;econdly, in their obedience to their Kings. Within the&s;e two fortre&s;&s;es, if they can keep them&s;elves, they need fear none ill; becau&s;e they &s;hall de&s;erve none. The only outward &s;trengths they have left them, are the two Towns of <HI>Montaban</HI> and <HI>Rochell,</HI> the one deemed invincible, the other threatned a &s;peedy de&s;truction. The Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon</HI> (at my being there) lay round about it, and it was &s;aid, that the Town was in very bad terms: all the neighbouring Towns, to who&s;e oppo&s;ition they much tru&s;ted, having yeelded at the fir&s;t fight of the Canon. <HI>Rochell,</HI> it is thought, cannot be forced
<PB N="234" REF="142">
by a&s;&s;ault, nor compelled by a famine. Some Prote|&s;tants are glad of, and hope to &s;ee the <HI>French</HI> Church re&s;tored to its former powerfulne&s;&s;e, by the re&s;i&s;tance of that Town meerly. I rather think, that the perver&s;e and &s;tub|born condition of it, will at la&s;t, drive the young King in|to a fury, and incite him to revenge their contradiction, on their innocent friends, now di&s;armed and di&s;abled. Then will they &s;ee at la&s;t the i&s;&s;ue of their own peremptory re&s;olutions, and begin to believe, that the Heathen Hi|&s;torian was of the two the better Chri&s;tian, when he gave us this note, <HI>Non turpe e&s;t ab eo vinci, quem vincere e&s;&s;et nefas, neque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">lli <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inhone&s;te etiam &s;ubmitti, quem fortuna &s;uper omnes ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uli&s;&s;et.</HI> This weakne&s;&s;e and mi&s;ery which hath now be|fallen the Prote&s;tants, was an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> effect, I confe&s;&s;e, of the ill|will which the other party bare them; but that they bare them ill will, was a fruit of their own graffing. In this circum&s;tance, they were nothing like <HI>Jacob,</HI> who in the hatred which his brother <HI>E&s;au</HI> had to him, was &s;imply pa&s;&s;ive; they being active al&s;o in the birth of it. And in|deed that lamentable and bloudy war, which &s;ell upon them, they not only endevoured not to avoid, but invited, du|ring the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. who would not &s;ee it, and the trouble&s;ome minority of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. who could not mole&s;t them, they had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of 99. Towns, well fortifyed and enabled for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">: a &s;trength too great for any one faction to keep together, under a King which de&s;ires to be him&s;elf, and rule his people. In the opinion of this their potency, they call A&s;&s;emblies, Parliaments as it were, when and as often as they plea&s;ed. There they con&s;ulted of the common affairs of Religion, made new Laws of govern|ment, removed and rechanged their generall officers; the Kings leave all this while never &s;o much as formally de|manded. Had they only been guilty of too much power, that crime alone had been &s;ufficient to have rai&s;ed a war a|gain&s;t them, it not &s;tanding with the &s;afety and honour of a King, not to be the ab&s;olute commander of his own Subjects. But in this their licentious calling of A&s;&s;emblies, they abu&s;ed their power into a neglect, and not di&s;&s;ol|ving them at his Maje&s;ties commandment, they increa&s;ed
<PB N="235" REF="142">
their neglect into into a di&s;obedience.

It was &s;aid by a Gentleman of their party, and one that had been imployed in many of their affairs, <HI>That the fiery zeal of &s;ome who had the guiding of their con&s;ciences, had thru&s;t them into tho&s;e de&s;perate cour&s;es;</HI> and I believe him;

This affront done to the King, made him gather together his Forces; yet at the Duke of <HI>Le&s;diguiers</HI> reque&s;t, he allow|ed them 24 dayes of re&s;pite; before his Armies &s;hould march towards them, he offered them al&s;o very fair and rea&s;onable conditions, &s;uch al&s;o as their Deputies had &s;o|licited, but far better then tho&s;e which they were glad to accept, when all their Towns were taken from them. <HI>Pro|fecto ineluct abilis fatorum vis, cujus fortunam mutare con&s;tituit, ejus corrumpit con&s;ilia.</HI> It held very rightly in this people, who turned a deaf eare to all good advice, and were re&s;ol|ved it &s;eemeth, <HI>Not to hear the voice of the Charmer, charmed he never &s;o &s;weetly.</HI> In their A&s;&s;emblie therefore they make Lawes and Orders to regulate their di&s;obedience, as, That no peace &s;hould be made without the con&s;ent of the gene|rall Convocation, about paying of Souldiers wages, for the detaining of the Revenues of the King and Clergy, and the like.

<P>In the &s;econd of <HI>Aprill,</HI> before he had as yet advanced into the field, he publi&s;hed a Declaration in favour of all tho&s;e of the Religion, which would contain them|&s;elves within duty and obedience.

<P>All things thus con&s;idered in their true being, I connot &s;ee for what cau&s;e our late Soveraign &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o much cen&s;ure as he then did, for not giving them a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I cannot but &s;ay, that my &s;elf have too often condemned his remi&s;&s;ene&s;&s;e in that cau&s;e, which upon better con&s;ideration I cannot tell how he &s;hould have dealt in. Had he been a medler in it further then he was, he had not &s;o much pre&s;erved Religion, as &s;upported Rebellion; be&s;ides the con&s;equence of the exam|ple. He had Subjects of his own more then enough, which were &s;ubject to di&s;content, and prone to an apo&s;ta&s;ie from their alleagiance. To have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the di&s;|obedient <HI>French</HI> under the colour of the liberty of con|&s;cience, had been only to have taught that King a way into <HI>England</HI> upon the &s;ame pretence; and to have trod the path of his own hazard. He had not long before denied &s;uccour to his own children, when he might have given them on a better ground, and for a fairer purpo&s;e; and could not now in honour countenance the like action in another. For that other, deniall of his helping hand, I much doubt how far po&s;terity will acquit him, though certainly he was a good Prince, and had been an happy in&s;trument of the peace of Chri&s;tendome, had not the

So that betwixt the quietne&s;&s;e of his nature, and the turbulency of his latter dayes, he &s;ell into that mi&s;era|ble exigent mentioned in the Hi&s;torian, <HI>Mi&s;errimum e&s;t eum alicui, aut natura &s;ua excedenda e&s;t, aut minuenda dignitas.</HI> Add to this, that the <HI>French</HI> had been fir&s;t abandoned at home by their own friends, of &s;even Generals which they had appointed for the &s;even circles into which they divided all <HI>France;</HI> four of them never giving them incourage|ment.

<P>If we demand what &s;hould move the <HI>French</HI> Prote|&s;tants to this Rebellious contradiction of his Maje&s;ties commandements.

And yet they are not brought &s;o low, but that they may live happily, if they can be content to live obediently; that which is taken from them, being matter of &s;trength only, and not priviledge.</P>
<P>Let us now look upon them in their Churches, which we &s;hall finde as empty of magnificence as ceremony. To talke among&s;t them of Common-prayers, were to fright them with the &s;econd coming of the Ma&s;&s;e; and to mention Prayers at the buriall of the dead, were to per&s;wade them of a Purgatory. Painted gla&s;&s;e in a Church window, is ac|counted for the flag and en&s;igne of Antichri&s;t: and for Or|gans, no que&s;tion but they are deemed to be the Devils bag|pipes. Shew them a Surplice, and they cry out, a rag of the Whore of <HI>Babylon;</HI> yet a &s;heet on a woman, when &s;he is in child-bed, is a greater abomination then the other. A &s;trange people, that could never think the Ma&s;&s;e-book &s;ufficiently reformed, till they had taken away Prayers; nor that their Churches could ever be hand&s;ome, untill they were ragged. This fooli&s;h oppo&s;ition of their fir&s;t Reformers, hath drawn the Prote&s;tants of the&s;e parts into a world of di&s;like and envie, and been no &s;mall di&s;advantage to the fide. Whereas the Church of <HI>England,</HI> though it di&s;&s;ent as much from the Papi&s;ts in point of Doctrine, is yet not uncha|ritably thought on by the Modern Catholicks, by rea&s;on it retained &s;uch an excellency of Di&s;cipline. When the <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">urgie</HI>

An allowance, which with &s;ome little help, might have been rai&s;ed higher, from the practice of our Church, to &s;ome points of our judge|ment, and it is very worthy of our ob&s;ervation, that which the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Rho&s;ny</HI> &s;pake of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> when he came as extraordinary Amba&s;&s;adour from King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. to welcome King <HI>James</HI> into <HI>England.</HI> For upon the view of our &s;olemn Service and ceremonies, he openly &s;aid unto his followers, <HI>That if the reformed Churches in France, had kept the &s;ame orders among&s;t them which we have, he was a&s;&s;ured that there would have been many thou&s;ands more of Protestants there, then now are.</HI> But the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Rho&s;ny</HI> was not the la&s;t that &s;aid &s;o, I have heard divers <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;ts, who were at the Queens coming over, and ventured &s;o far upon an ex|communication, as to be pre&s;ent at our Church &s;olemn Services, extoll them and us for their &s;akes, even almo&s;t unto hyperboles. So graciou&s;ly is our temper entertained among&s;t them.</P>
<P>As are their Churches, &s;uch is their Di&s;cipline, naked of all Antiquity, and almo&s;t as modern as the men which imbrace it. The power and calling of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> they abrogated with the Ma&s;&s;e, upon no other cau&s;e then that <HI>Geneva</HI> had done it. As if that excellent man Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> had been the <HI>Pytha|goras</HI> of our age, and his <GAP DESC="foreign">, his <HI>ip&s;e dixit,</HI> had &s;tood for Oracles.

of ignorance and a trade, are the mo&s;t weighty matters of the Church committed. In them is the power of ordaining Prie&s;ts, of conferring places of charge, and even of the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure of the Church, Excommunication. When any bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e which concerneth the good of the Congregation is befallen, they mu&s;t be called to councell, and you &s;hall finde them there as &s;oon as ever they can put off their Aprons; having blurted out there a little Cla&s;&s;icall non-&s;en&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed their con&s;ents rather by nodding of their heads, then any other &s;en&s;ible articulation, they ha&s;ten to their &s;hops, as <HI>Quinctius</HI> the Dictator in <HI>Florus</HI> did to his plough, <HI>Vt ad opus relictum fe&s;tina&s;&s;e videatur.</HI> Such a plat-form, though it be, that needeth no further confutation then to know it, yet had it been tolerable if the contrivers of it had not en|devoured to impo&s;e it on all the Reformation.

The maintenance which is allotted to them, &s;carce amoun|teth to a competency, though by that name they plea&s;e to call it. With receiving of tithes they never meddle, and therefore in their Schi&s;maticall tracts of Divinity, they do hardly allow of the paying of them. Some of them hold that they were <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> and abrogated with the Law. Others think them to be meerly <HI>jure humano,</HI> and yet that they may lawfully be accepted, where they are tendred. It is well known yet that there are &s;ome among&s;t them, which will commend grapes, though they cannot reach them. This competence may come unto 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI> yearly, or a little more. <HI>Beza</HI> that great and famous

<P>As for the Tithes, they belong to the &s;everall Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts in who&s;e Precincts they are due; and they, I'le warrant you, according to the little learning which they have, will main|tain them to be <HI>jure divino.</HI> The Sermons of the <HI>French</HI> are very plain and home-&s;pun, little in them of the Fathers, and le&s;&s;e of humane learning; it being concluded in the Synod of <HI>Gappe,</HI> that only the Scriptures &s;hould be u&s;ed in their Pulpits.

<P>HAving thus &s;poken of the Churches; I mu&s;t now treat a little of the Common-wealth. Religion is as the &s;oul of a State, Policy as the body; we can hardly di&s;cour&s;e of the one, without a relation to the other; if we do, we commit a wilfull murder, in thus de|&s;troying a republick. The Common-wealth without the Church, is but a carka&s;&s;e, a thing inanimate. The Church without the Common-wealth is as it were <HI>anima &s;eparata,</HI>

There is be&s;ides the ge|neral re&s;pect of each to other, a more particular band betwixt them here in <HI>France,</HI> which is a likene&s;&s;e and re&s;emblance. In the Church of <HI>France</HI> we have found an head and a body; this body again divided into two parts, the Catholick and the Prote&s;tant: the head is in his own opinion, and the minds of many others, of a power unlimited; yet the Catholick party hath &s;trongly curbed it. And of the two parts of the body, we &s;ee the Papi&s;ts flouri&s;hing and in triumph, while&s;t that of the Prote&s;tant is in mi&s;ery and affliction. Thus is it al&s;o in the body Politick. The King in his own conceit boundle&s;&s;e and omnipotent, is yet affronted by his Nobles; which Nobles enjoy all the free|dome of riches and happine&s;&s;e; the poor Pai&s;ants in the mean time living in drudgery and bondage.</P>
<P>For the government of the King is meerly, indeed, regal, or to give it the true name <HI>de&s;poticall;</HI> though the Countrey be his wife, and all the people are his children, yet doth he neither govern as an husband or a father; he accoun|teth of them all as of his &s;ervants, and therefore comman|deth them as a Ma&s;ter. In his Edicts which he over frequen|ly &s;endeth about, he never mentioneth the good will of his Subjects, nor the approbation of his Councell, but con|cludeth all of them in this forme, <HI>Car tell e&s;t nostre plai&s;ir, Sic volo &s;ic jubeo.</HI> A forme of government very prone to degenerate into a tyranny, if the Princes had not oftentimes &s;trength and will to make re&s;i&s;tance. But this is not the vice of the entire and Soveraign Monarchy alone; which the Greek call <GAP DESC="foreign">; the other two good formes of regiment, being &s;ubject al&s;o to the &s;ame frailty. Thus in the reading of Hi&s;tories have we ob&s;erved an <HI>Ari&s;tocracie,</HI> to have been fre|quently
<PB N="248" REF="149">
corrupted into an <HI>Oligarchie;</HI> and a <GAP DESC="foreign"> (or Common-wealth properly &s;o called) into a <HI>Democratie.</HI> For as in the body naturall, the pure&s;t complexions are le&s;&s;e la&s;ting, but ea&s;ily broken and &s;ubject to alteration; &s;o is it in the body Civill, the pure and unmixt formes of Govern|ment, though perfect and ab&s;olute in their kinds, are yet of little continuance, and very &s;ubject to change into its oppo&s;ite. They therefore which have written of Republicks do mo&s;t applaud and commend the mixt manner of rule, which is equally compounded of the Kingdome and the <HI>Politeia;</HI> becau&s;e in the&s;e the Kings have all the power be|longing to their title, without prejudice to the populacie. In the&s;e there is referred to the King, ab&s;olute Maje&s;ty; to the Nobles, convenient authority; to the People, an incor|rupted liberty: all in a ju&s;t and equall proportion. Every one of the&s;e is like the Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> as it was modera|ted by <HI>Nerva, Qui res ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m di&s;&s;ociabiles mi&s;cuerat, principatum &amp; libertatem;</HI> wherein the Soveraignty of one endamaged not the freedome of all. A rare mixture of Government, and &s;uch at this time is the Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> a King|dome of a perfect and happy compo&s;ition; wherein the King hath his full Prerogative, the Nobles all due re|&s;pects, and the People, among&s;t other ble&s;&s;ings per|fect in this, that they are ma&s;ters of their own pur|po&s;es, and have a &s;trong hand in the making of their own Laws.</P>
<P>On the other&s;ide, in the Regall government of <HI>France,</HI> the Subject frameth his life meerly as the Kings variable Edicts &s;hall plea&s;e to enjoyn him; is ravi&s;hed of his money as the Kings taske-ma&s;ters think fit; and &s;uffereth many other oppre&s;&s;ions, which in their proper place &s;hall be &s;pecified.

If a monied man can make a friend in Court, he may have an office found for him, of &s;ix pence upon every Sword made in <HI>France;</HI> a Livre, upon the &s;elling of every head of Cattell; a brace of Sols, for every paire of boots, and the like.

<P>As for Monopolies, they are here &s;o common, that the Subject taketh no notice of it; not a &s;curvey petty book be|ing Printed, but it hath its priviledge affixed, <HI>Ad imprimen|dum &s;olum.</HI> The&s;e being granted by the King, are carryed to the Parliament, by them formally peru&s;ed, and finally verified; after which, they are in force and virtue again&s;t all oppo&s;ition.

The late Wars which he managed again&s;t the Prote&s;tants co&s;t him deer, he being fain to bind unto him mo&s;t of his Princes by money and pen&s;ions. As the expen&s;es of the King are brought unto this Court to be examined, &s;o are al&s;o the Gifts and Pen&s;ions by him granted to be ratified. The ti|tulary power given unto this Chamber, is to cut off all tho&s;e of the Kings grants which have no good ground and foundation; the officers being &s;olemnly (at the lea&s;t formally) &s;worn, not to &s;uffer any thing to pa&s;&s;e them, to the detriment of the Kingdome, what&s;oever Letters of command thay have to the contrary.

To this Court al&s;o belongeth the <HI>Enfranchi&s;ement</HI> or <HI>Naturalization of Aliens,</HI> anciently certain Lords, officers of the Crown, and of the prime coun&s;ell were appointed to look unto the accounts.

From the King de&s;cend we to the Subjects, <HI>ab equis (quod aiunt) ad a&s;inos,</HI> and the phra&s;e is not much improper; the <HI>French</HI> commonalty being called <HI>the Kings a&s;&s;es.</HI> The&s;e are di|vided into three ranks or Cla&s;&s;es, the Clergy, the Nobles, the Pai&s;ants; out of which certain delegates or Commit|tees, cho&s;en upon occa&s;ion, and &s;ent to the King, did an|tiently concur to the making of the Supreme Court for Ju&s;tice in <HI>France.</HI> It was called the A&s;&s;embly of the three E&s;tates, or the <HI>Conventus ordinum;</HI> and was ju&s;t like the Parli|ament of <HI>England.</HI> But the&s;e meetings are now forgotten, or out of u&s;e; neither, indeed, as this time goeth, can they any way advantage the State; for whereas there are three principall, if not &s;ole cau&s;es of the&s;e conventions, which are, the de&s;po&s;ing of the Regency during the nonage or &s;ickne&s;&s;e of a King; the granting Aides and Sub&s;idies; and the redre&s;&s;ing of Grievances: there is now another cour&s;e taken in them.

learned man calleth him, in his fourth book of Politicks hath an excellent di&s;cour&s;e concerning this di&s;proporti|on. In that Chapter, his project is, to have a corre&s;pon|dency &s;o far between Subjects under the King or people of the &s;ame City, that neither the one might be over rich, nor the other too mi&s;erably poor. They, &s;aith he, which are too happy, &s;trong, or rich, or greatly favour|ed, and the like, can not nor will not obey, with which evill they are infected from their infancy. The other through want of the&s;e things are too abjectly minded and ba&s;e; &s;o that the one cannot but command, nor the o|ther but &s;erve. And this he calleth <GAP DESC="foreign">, a City inhabited onely by Slaves and Tyrants. That que&s;tionle&s;&s;e is the mo&s;t perfect and compleat forme of Government, <HI>Ubi veneratur protentem humilis, non timet; antecedit, non contemnit humiliorem potens,</HI> as <HI>Velleius.</HI> But this is an un|happine&s;&s;e of which <HI>France</HI> is not capable; their Lords be|ing Kings, and their Commons Villains.</P>
<P>And not to &s;ay le&s;&s;e of them then indeed they are, the Princes of this Countrey, are but little inferiour in matter of Royalty, to any King abroad; and by con&s;equence little re&s;pective, in matter of obedience, to their own King at home. Upon the lea&s;t di&s;content, they withdraw them|&s;elves from the Court, or put them&s;elves into armes; and of all other comforts are ever &s;ure of this, that they &s;hall never want partizans. Neither do they u&s;e to &s;tand off from him fearfully, and at di&s;tance, but ju&s;tifie their re|volt by publick Declaration, and think the King much in|debted to them, if upon fair terms and an honourable re|concilement, they will plea&s;e to put them&s;elves again into his obedience. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. was a Prince of as undaunted and uncontroulable a &s;pirit, as ever any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and one that loved to be obeyed; yet was he al&s;o very frequent|ly baffled by the&s;e Roytelets, and at the la&s;t dyed in an af|front. The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> perceiving the Kings affection to his new Lady, began to grow jealous of him, for which rea&s;on he retired unto <HI>Bruxells:</HI> the King offended at his retreat, &s;ent after him, and commanded him home. The Prince returned an&s;wer, that he was the Kings mo&s;t hum|ble

Subject and &s;ervant; but into <HI>France</HI> he would not come unle&s;&s;e he might have a Town for his a&s;&s;urance; withall he prote&s;ted in publick writing a nullity of any thing that &s;hould be done to his prejudice in his ab&s;ence. A &s;tomach|full re&s;olution, and misbecoming a Subject; yet in this op|po&s;ition he per&s;i&s;ted, his humor of di&s;obedience out-living the King whom he had thus affronted. But the&s;e tricks are ordinary here, otherwi&s;e a man might have con&s;trued this action, by the term of Rebellion. The chief means where|by the&s;e Princes become &s;o head &s;trong, are an immunity given them by their Kings, and a liberty which they have taken to them&s;elves. By their Kings they have been ab&s;o|lutely exempted from all Tributes, Tolles, Taxes, Cu&s;tomes, Impo&s;itions and Sub&s;idies. By them al&s;o they have been e&s;tated in whole entire Provinces, with a power of <HI>haute and main Ju&s;tice</HI> (as the Lawyers term it) pa&s;&s;ed over to them; the Kings having &s;carce an homage or acknowledgment of them. To this they have added much for their &s;trength and &s;ecuri|ty, by the in&s;concing and fortifying of their hou&s;es, which both often moveth, and afterwards inableth them to con|temn his Maje&s;ty. An example we have of this in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Rochfort</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Tremoville,</HI> which in the long Civill wars endured a &s;iege of 5000 &s;hot, and yet was not taken. A very impolitick cour&s;e (in my conceit) of the <HI>French,</HI> to be&s;tow honours and immunities upon tho&s;e, <HI>Qui</HI> (as the Hi&s;torian noteth) <HI>ea &s;uo arbitrio aut repo&s;ituri, aut retenturi videantur; quique modum habent in &s;ua voluntate.</HI> For upon a knowledge of this &s;trength in them&s;elves, the Princes have been always prone to Civill wars, as having &s;ufficient means for &s;afety and re&s;i&s;tance&punc; On this ground al&s;o they &s;light the Kings authority, and di&s;obey his Ju&s;tice. In &s;o much that the greater &s;ort of Nobles in this Kingdome, can &s;el|dome be arraigned or executed in per&s;on; and therefore the Lawes condemn them in their images, and hang them in their pictures. A pretty device to mock Ju&s;tice.

I &s;peak not here of tho&s;e that are &s;tyled <HI>La Noble&s;&s;e,</HI> but of <HI>Titulados,</HI> men only of titular Nobility, of the degree of Baron and above. Of the&s;e there is in this Countrey a number almo&s;t innume|rable. <HI>Quot Coelum Stellas;</HI> take quantity for quantity, and I dare be of the opinion, that heaven hath not more Stars, then <HI>France</HI> Nobles. You &s;hall meet with them &s;o thick in the Kings Court e&s;pecially, that you would think it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible the Countrey &s;hould bear any other fruit. This, I think, I may &s;afely affirme, and without Hyperbole, that they have there as many Princes, as we in <HI>England</HI> have Dukes; as many Dukes, as we Earls; as many Earls, as we Barons; and as many Barons as we have Knights; a jolly company, and &s;uch as know their own &s;trength too. I can|not therefore but much marvell, that the&s;e Kings &s;hould be &s;o prodigall in conferring honours; con&s;idering this, that every Noble man he createth, is &s;o great a weakning to his power.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, I cannot but as much wonder at &s;ome of our Nation, who have murmured again&s;t our late Soveraign, and accu&s;ed him of an unpardonable unthriftine&s;s, in be|&s;towing the dignities of his Realm, with &s;o full and liberall a hand. Certainly, could there any danger have ari&s;en by it unto the State, I could have been as impatient of it as another. But with us, titles and ennoblings in this kind, are only either the Kings favour, or the parties merit, and maketh whom&s;oever he be that receiveth them, rather re|verenced then powerfull. <HI>Raro eorum honoribus invidetur, quorum vis non timetur,</HI> was a good Aphori&s;me in the dayes of <HI>Paterculus;</HI> and may for ought I know be as good &s;till. Why &s;hould I envie any man that honour, which taketh not from my &s;afety; or repine at my Soveraign for rai&s;ing any of his Servants into an higher degree of eminency, when that favour cannot make them exorbitant? Be&s;ides it con|cerneth the improvement of the Exchequer, at the occa&s;i|ons of Sub&s;idies, and the glory of the Kingdome, when the
<PB N="255" REF="152">
Prince is not attended by men meerly of the vulgar. Add to this, the few Noble men of any title w^c^h he found at his hap|py coming in among&s;t us, and the additions of power which his comming brought unto us; and we &s;hall finde it pro|portionable, that he &s;hould enlarge our Nobility, with our Empire: neither yet have we, indeed, a number to be talked of, comparing us with our neighbour Nations. We may &s;ee all of the three fir&s;t ranks in the books of <HI>Milles, Brooke,</HI> and <HI>Vincent;</HI> and we are promi&s;ed al&s;o a Catalogue of the Crea|tions and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of all our Barons. Then we &s;hould &s;ee that as yet we have not &s;urfeited. Were this care taken by the Heralde in <HI>France,</HI> perhaps the Nobility there would not &s;eem &s;o numberle&s;&s;e; &s;ure I am not &s;o confu&s;ed. But this is the main vice of that profe&s;&s;ion, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ix Heralds which they have among&s;t them, <HI>viz.

<P>The Nobles being &s;o populous, it cannot be but the <HI>Noble&s;&s;e,</HI> as they call them; that is, the Gentry, mu&s;t needs be thick &s;et and only not innumerable.

As for the women, they know in what degree nature hath created them, and therefore dare not be &s;o fine as their Husbands; &s;ome of them never had above one pair of &s;tockins in all their lives, which they wear every day, for indeed they are very durable.

But of all mi&s;eries, this me thinketh is the greate&s;t, that &s;owing &s;o many acres of excellent wheat in an year, and gathering in &s;uch a plentifull Vintage as they do, they &s;hould not yet be &s;o fortunate, as to eat white bread, or drink wine; for &s;uch infinite rents do they pay to their Lords, and &s;uch innumerable taxes to the King, that the profits ari&s;ing out of tho&s;e commo|dities, are only &s;ufficient to pay their duties, and keep them from the extremities of cold and famine. The bread then which they eat, is of the cour&s;e&s;t flowre, and &s;o black, that it cannot admit the name of brown. And as for their drink, they have recour&s;e to the next Fountain.

<P>Yet were their ca&s;e not altogether &s;o deplorable, if there were but hopes left to them of a better, if they could but compa&s;&s;e certainty, that a painfull drudging and a thrifty &s;aving, would one day bring them out of this hell of bondage. In this, que&s;tionle&s;&s;e, they are intirely mi&s;e|rable, in that they are &s;en&s;ible of the wretchedne&s;&s;e of their pre&s;ent fortunes, and dare not labour nor expect an alteration. If indu&s;try and a &s;paring hand hath rai&s;ed any of this afflicted people &s;o high, that he is but 40 <HI>s</HI> or 5 <HI>l.</HI> richer then his neighbour, his Lord immediately en|haunceth his Rents, and enformeth the Kings task-ma&s;ters of his riches, by which means he is within two or three years brought again to equall poverty with the re&s;t. A &s;trange cour&s;e, and much different from that of <HI>England,</HI> where the Gentry take a delight in having their Tenants thrive under them, and hold it no crime in any that hold of them to be wealthy. On the other &s;ide, tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> can abide no body to gain or grow rich upon their farmes; and therefore thus upon occa&s;ions rack their poor Tenants. In which they are like the Tyrant <HI>Procru&s;tes,</HI> who laying hands upon all he met, ca&s;t them upon his bed; if they were &s;horter then it, he racked their joynts till he had made them even to it, if they were longer, he cut as much of their bodies from them, as did hang over; &s;o keeping all that fell into his power in an equality. All the <HI>French</HI> Lords are like that Tyrant.</P>
<P>How much this cour&s;e doth depre&s;&s;e the military power of this Kingdome is apparent by the true principles of war, and the examples of other Countries. For it hath been held by the generall opinion of the be&s;t judgements in matters of war, that the main Buttre&s;&s;e and Pillar of an Army is the foot, or (as the Martiali&s;ts term it) the <HI>Infan|tery.</HI> Now to make a good Infantery, it requireth that men
<PB N="262" REF="156">
be brought up not in a &s;lavi&s;h and needy fa&s;hion of life, but in &s;ome free and liberall manner. Therefore it is well ob&s;erved by the Vicoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> St. <HI>Albans</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. that if a State run mo&s;t to Nobles and Gentry, and that the Husbandmen be but as their meer drudges, or el&s;e &s;imply Cottagers, that that State may have a good Caval|lery, but never good &s;table bands of foot. Like to Coppice woods, in which if you let them grow too thick in the &s;tadles, they run to bu&s;hes or bryers, and have little clean under-wood. Neither is this in <HI>France</HI> only, but in <HI>Italy</HI> al&s;o, and &s;ome other parts abroad; in &s;o much, that they are enforced to imploy mercenary Souldiers for their battalions of foot: whereby it cometh to pa&s;&s;e, that in tho&s;e Coun|tries they have much people, and few men. On this con|&s;ideration King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. one of the wi&s;e&s;t of our Princes took a cour&s;e &s;o cunning and whole&s;ome, for the increa&s;e of the military power of his Realm; that though it be much le&s;&s;e in territory, yet it &s;hould have infinitely more Souldiers of its native forces, then its neighbour Nations. For in the fourth year of his Reign, there pa&s;&s;ed an Act of Parliament preten&s;ively again&s;t the depopulation of Vil|lages, and decay of tillage, but purpo&s;edly to inable his &s;ub|jects for the wars. The Act was, <HI>That all hou&s;es of husbandry which had been u&s;ed with twenty acres of ground and upwards, &s;hould be maintained and kept up for, together with a competent proportion of Land, to be u&s;ed and occupied with them,</HI> &amp;c. By this means, the hou&s;es being kept up, did of nece&s;&s;ity enforce a dweller, and that dweller, becau&s;e of the proportion of Land, not to be a begger, but a man of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance, able to keep Hinds and Servants, and to &s;et the plough a going. An order which did wonderfully concerne the might and manhood of the Kingdome; the&s;e Farmes be|ing &s;ufficient to maintaine an able body out of penu|ry; and by con&s;equence to prepare them for &s;ervice, and encourage them to higher honours, for

But this Ordinance is not thought of &s;uch u&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> where all the hopes of their Armies con&s;i&s;t in the Cavallery or the hor&s;e; which perhaps is the cau&s;e why our An|ce&s;tors have won &s;o many battailes upon them.

<P>Be&s;ides, &s;hould the <HI>French</HI> people be enfranchi&s;ed, as it were, from the tyranny of their Lords, and e&s;tated in free|holds and other tenures, after the manner of <HI>England,</HI> it would much trouble the Councell of <HI>France,</HI> to find out a new way of rai&s;ing his revenues, which are now meerly &s;ucked out of the bloud and &s;weat of the Subject. Anti|ently the Kings of <HI>France</HI> had rich and plentifull demeans, &s;uch as was &s;ufficient to maintain their greatne&s;&s;e and Ma|je&s;ty, without being burden&s;ome unto the Countrey. Pride in matters of &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;&s;e, and the tedious Civill wars, which have la&s;ted in this Countrey, almo&s;t ever &s;ince the death of <HI>Henry</HI> II. have been the occa&s;ion that mo&s;t of the Crown lands have been &s;old and morgaged; in &s;o much that the people are now become the <HI>Demaine,</HI> and the Sub|ject only is the Revenue of the Crown. By the &s;weat of their browes is the Court &s;ed, and the Souldier paid; and by their labours are the Princes maintained in idlene&s;&s;e. What impo&s;itions &s;oever it plea&s;eth the King to put upon them, it is almo&s;t a point of trea&s;on not only to deny, but to que&s;tion. <HI>Apud illos vere regnatur, nefa&s;que quantum regi liceat, dubitare;</HI> as one of them. The Kings hand lyeth hard upon them, and hath almo&s;t thru&s;t them into an <HI>Egyptian</HI> bondage, the poor Pai&s;ant being con&s;trained to make up dayly his full tale of bricks, and yet have no &s;traw allowed them. Upon a &s;ight of the mi&s;eries and poverties of this people, Sir <HI>John Forte&s;cue,</HI> Chancellour of <HI>England,</HI> in his book in|tituled, <HI>De Laudibus legum Angliae,</HI> concludeth them to be unfit men for Jurors or Judges, &s;hould the cu&s;tome of the Countrey admit of &s;uch tryals.

Emperiall Lawes, by the depo&s;ition only of two witne&s;&s;es, or the forced confe&s;&s;ion of the per&s;ons, arrained, the Prince &s;eemed to marvell, <HI>Cur ed lex Angliae quae tam fiugi &amp; optabilis e&s;t, non &s;it toti mundo communis.</HI> To this he maketh an&s;wer, by &s;hewing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ree condition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, who alone are u&s;ed at the&s;e indictments; men of a fair and large e&s;tate, &s;uch as dwell nigh the place of the deed com|mitted, men that are of ingenuous education, &s;uch as &s;corn to be &s;uborned or corrupted, and afraid of infamie. Then he &s;heweth how in other places all things are contrary, the Husbandman an ab&s;olute begger, ea&s;ie to be bribed by rea&s;on of his poverty; the Gentlemen living far a&s;under, and &s;o taking no notice of the fact; the Pai&s;ant al&s;o neither fea|ring infamie, nor the lo&s;&s;e of goods, if he be found faulty, becau&s;e he hath them not. In the end he concludeth thus, <HI>Ne mireris igitur princeps, &s;i lex per quam in Anglia veritas inqui|ritur, alias non pervagetur nationes, ip&s;ae namque ut Anglia neque|runt facere &s;ufficientes con&s;imile&s;que Juratas.</HI> The la&s;t part of the latine, &s;avoureth &s;omewhat of the Lawyer, the word <HI>Juratas</HI> being put there to &s;ignifie a <HI>Jury.</HI></P>
<P>To go over all tho&s;e impo&s;itions, which this mi&s;erable people are afflicted withal, were almo&s;t as wretched as the pay|ment of them; I wiil therefore &s;peak only of the principall. And here I meet in the fir&s;t place, with the Gabell or Im|po&s;ition on Salt. This <HI>Gabelle de &s;el,</HI> this Impo&s;t on Salt was fir&s;t begun by <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Long,</HI> who took for it a double (which is half a Sol) upon the pound. After whom <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valoys, anno</HI> 1328. doubled that. <HI>Charles</HI> the VII. rai&s;ed it unto three doubles; and <HI>Lewis</HI> the XI. unto &s;ix. Since that time it hath been altered from &s;o much upon the pound to a certain rate on the Mine, which containeth &s;ome 30 bu&s;hels <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the rates ri&s;ing and falling at the Kings plea&s;ure. This one commodity were very advantagious to the Exchequer, were it all in the Kings hands; but at this time a great part of it is morgaged. It is thought to be worth unto the King three millions of Crowns yearly; that only of <HI>Paris</HI> and the Provo&s;ts &s;even Daughters, being farmed at 1700000 Crowns the year. The late Kings &s;ince <HI>anno</HI> 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">1. being intangled in wars, have been con&s;trained to
<PB N="265" REF="157">
let it out others; in &s;o much that about <HI>anno</HI> 1599. the King lo&s;t above 800000 Crowns yearly: and no longer agone then <HI>anno</HI> 1621. the King taking up 600000 pounds, of the Provo&s;t of Merchands and the E&s;chevines, gave unto them a rent charge of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> yearly, to be i&s;&s;uing out of his Cu&s;tomes of Salt, till their money were repaid them. This Gabell is, indeed, a Monopoly, and that one of the un|ju&s;te&s;t and unrea&s;onable&s;t in the World. For no man in the Kingdom (tho&s;e Countries hereafter mentioned ex|cepted) can eat any Salt, but he mu&s;t buy of the King and at his price, which is mo&s;t uncon&s;cionable; that being &s;old at <HI>Paris</HI> and el&s;ewhere for five Livres, which in the ex|empted places is &s;old for one. Therefore that the Kings profits might not be dimini&s;hed, there is diligent watch and ward, that no forain Salt be brought into the Land, upon pain of forfeiture and impri&s;oment. A &s;earch which is made &s;o &s;trictly, that we had much ado at <HI>Dieppe</HI> to be pardoned the &s;earching of our trunks and port-mantles, and that not, but upon &s;olemn prote&s;tation, that we had none of that commodity. This Salt is of a brown colour, being only &s;uch as we in <HI>England</HI> call Bay &s;alt; and impo&s;ed on the Subjects by the Kings Officers with great rigour, for though they have &s;ome of their la&s;t provi&s;ion in the hou&s;e, or perchance would be content (through poverty) to eat meat without it, yet will the&s;e cruell villaines enforce them to take &s;uch a quantity of them; or how&s;oever they will have of them &s;o much money.</P>
<P>But this Tyranny is not generall, the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Pi|cards</HI> enduring mo&s;t of it, and the other Pai&s;ant the re&s;t. Much like unto which was the Licence which the Popes and Bi&s;hops of old granted in matter of keeping Concu|bines. For when &s;uch as had the charge of gathering the Popes Rents happened upon a Prie&s;t which had no Concubine, and for that cau&s;e made deniall of the Tributes; the Collectours would return them this an|&s;wer, that notwith&s;tanding this, they &s;hould pay the money, becau&s;e they might have the keeping of a wench if they would.</P>

Antiently the Tailles were only levyed by way of extraordinary Sub&s;idie, and that but upon four occa&s;ions, which were, the Knighting of the King Son, the marriage of his Daughters, a Voyage of the Kings beyond &s;ea, and his Ran&s;ome in ca&s;e he were taken Pri&s;oner; <HI>Les Tailles ne &s;ont point devis de voir or|dinaire</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Ragneau) ains ant e&s;te accorde&egrave;s durant la nece&s;&s;ite des affaires &s;eulement.</HI> Afterwards they were continually levyed in times of war; and at length <HI>Chales</HI> the VII. made them ordinary. Were it extended equally on all, it would amount to a very fair Revenue. For &s;uppo&s;ing this, that the Kingdome of <HI>France</HI> containeth 200 millions of Acres (as it doth) and that from every acre there were rai&s;ed to the King two Sols yearly, which is little in re&s;pect of what the Taxes impo&s;e upon them: That income alone, be&s;ides that which is levyed on Goods per&s;onall, would amount to two millions of pounds in a year. But this payment al&s;o lyeth on the Pai&s;ant; the greater Towns, the officers of the Kings hou&s;e, the Officers of War, the Pre&s;ident, Coun&s;ellors and Officers of the Courts of Parliament, the Nobility, the Clergy, and the Scholars of the Univer&s;ity being freed from it.</P>
<P>That which they call the Taillon, was intended for the ea&s;e of the Countrey, though now it prove one of the greate&s;t burdens unto it. In former times the Kings Soul|diers lay all upon the charge of the Villages, the poor people being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ain to finde them diet, lodging, and all nece&s;&s;aries, for them&s;elves, their hor&s;es, and the harlots which they brought with them. If they were not well plea&s;ed with their entertainment, they u&s;ed commonly to beat their Ho&s;t, abu&s;e his family, and rob him of that &s;mall provi&s;ion, which he had laid up for his children; and all this <HI>Cum privilegio.</HI> Thus did they move from one Village to another, and at the la&s;t again returned to them from whence they came; <HI>Ita ut non &s;it ibi villula una expers cala|mitatis

To re|dre&s;&s;e this mi&s;chief, King <HI>Henry</HI> II. <HI>anno</HI> 1549. rai&s;ed this im|po&s;ition called the Taillon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pancarte</HI> comprehendeth in it divers particular Im|po&s;ts, but e&s;pecially the Sol upon the Livre; that is, the twentieth penny of all things bought or &s;old, Corne, Sallets, and the like only excepted. Upon wine, be&s;ides the Sol upon the Livre, he hath his &s;everall Cu&s;tomes of the entrance of it into any of his Cities, pa&s;&s;ages by Land, Sea or Rivers. To the&s;e <HI>Charles</HI> the IX. <HI>anno</HI> 1461. added a Tax of five Sols upon every Muye (which is the third part of a Tun) and yet when all this is done, the poor Vintner payeth un|to the King the eight penny he takes for that Wine which he &s;elleth. In this <HI>Pancar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> is al&s;o contained the <HI>Haut pa&s;&s;age,</HI> which are the Tolles paid unto the King for pa&s;|&s;age of Men and Cattell over his bridges, and his City gates, as al&s;o for all &s;uch commodities as they bring with them: a good round &s;um con&s;idering the largene&s;&s;e of the Kingdome; the through-fare of <HI>Lyons,</HI> being farmed yearly of the King for 100000 Crowns. Hereunto belong al&s;o the <HI>Aides,</HI> which are a Tax of the Sol al&s;o in the Livre, up|on all &s;orts of Fruits, Provi&s;ion, Wares, and Merchandi&s;e, granted fir&s;t unto <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> when <HI>John</HI> his father was Pri&s;oner in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ince made perpetuall. For &s;uch is the lamentable fate of this Countrey, that their kindne&s;&s;es are made duty; and tho&s;e moneys which they once grant out of love, are always after exacted of them, and payed out of nece&s;&s;ity. The <HI>Bedroll</HI> of all the&s;e impo|&s;itions and Taxes, is called the <HI>Pancarte,</HI> becau&s;e it was han|ged in a frame, like as the Officers fees are in our Dioce&s;an Courts; the word <HI>Pan</HI> &s;ignifying a frame or a pane of Wain&s;cot. The&s;e Impo&s;itions time and cu&s;tome hath now made tolerable, though at fir&s;t they &s;eemed very burden|&s;ome, and moved many Cities to murmuring, &s;ome to rebellion; among&s;t others, the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> proud of her antient liberties and immunities, refu&s;ed to admit of it. This indignity &s;o incen&s;ed <HI>Charles</HI> the VI. their King, then young and in hot bloud, that he &s;eized into his hands all
<PB N="269" REF="159">
their priviledges, took from them their <HI>Provo&s;t des Mer|chands,</HI> and the <HI>E&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vins,</HI> as al&s;o the Keyes of their gates, and the Chaines of their &s;treets, and making through the whole Town &s;uch a face of mourning, that one might ju&s;tly have &s;aid,
<Q><L>Haec facies Trojae, cum caperetur, erat.</L></Q>
This hapned in the year 1383. and was for five years toge|ther continued, which time being expired, and other Cities warned by that example, the Impo&s;ition was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the priviledges re&s;tored. For the better regulating of the Profits ari&s;ing from the&s;e Impo&s;ts, the <HI>French</HI> King erected a Court called, <HI>Le Cour des Aides;</HI> it con&s;i&s;ted at the fir&s;t of the Generals of the Aides, and of any four of the Lords of the Councell, whom they would call to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> the V. <HI>anno</HI> 1380 or there|abouts &s;etled it in <HI>Paris,</HI> and cau&s;ed it to be numbred as one of the Soveraign Courts. <HI>Lewis</HI> the XI. di&s;&s;olved it, and committed the managing of his Aids to his hou&s;hold &s;ervants, as loath to have any publick officers take notice how he fleeced his people. <HI>Anno</HI> 1464. it was re&s;tored a|gain. And finally, <HI>Henry</HI> II. <HI>anno</HI> 1551. added to it a &s;econd Chamber compo&s;ed of two Pre&s;idents and eight Coun&s;el|lours; one of which Pre&s;idents, named Mr. <HI>Chevalier,</HI> is &s;aid to be the be&s;t monied man of all <HI>France.</HI> There are al&s;o others of the&s;e Courts in the Countrey, as one at <HI>Roven,</HI> one at <HI>Montferrant</HI> in <HI>Avergne,</HI> one at <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> and another at <HI>Montpelier,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>Charles</HI> VII. <HI>anno</HI> 1437&punc;</P>
<P>For the levying and gathering up of the&s;e Taxes, you mu&s;t know that the whole Countrey of <HI>France</HI> is divided into 21 <HI>Generalities,</HI> or Counties as it were, and tho&s;e a|gain into divers <HI>E&s;lectiones,</HI> which are much like our Hun|dreds. In every of the <HI>Generalities,</HI> there are 10 or 12 Trea|&s;urers, 9 Receivers for the generalty, and as many Com|ptollers; and in the particular <HI>E&s;lectiones,</HI> eight Recei|vers and as many Comptrollers, be&s;ides all under-officers, which are thought to amount in all to 30000 men&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="160">
When then the King levyeth his Taxes, he &s;endeth his Letters Patents to the principall Officers of every Generalty, whom they call <HI>Les Genereaux des Aides,</HI> and they di&s;patch their Warrant to the <HI>E&s;leus</HI> or Commi&s;&s;ioners. The&s;e taxing every one of the Pari&s;hes and Villages within their &s;everall divi&s;ions at a certain rate, &s;end their receivers to collect it, who give account for it to their Comptrollers. By them it a&s;cendeth to the <HI>E&s;leus,</HI> from him to the Receiver generall of that Generalty, next to the Comptroller, then to the Trea|&s;urer, afterwards to the <HI>Generall des Aides;</HI> and &s;o

By all the&s;e hands it is at la&s;t conveyed into the Kings pur&s;e; in which &s;everall pa&s;&s;ages, <HI>Nece&s;&s;e e&s;t ut aliquid haereat,</HI> it cannot be but that it mu&s;t have many a &s;hrewd &s;natch. In &s;o much that I was told by a Gentleman of good credence in <HI>France,</HI> that there could not be gathered by the &s;everall exactions above &s;pecified, and other devi&s;es of prowling, which I have omitted, le&s;&s;e then 85 millions a year, where|of the King receiveth 15 only. A report not altogether to be &s;lighted, con&s;idering the Pre&s;ident of the Court of Ac|comptes made it evident to the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Bloys,</HI> in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. that by the time that every one of the Of|ficers had his &s;hare of it, there came not to the Kings Cof|fers one <HI>te&s;ton</HI> (which is 1 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.)</HI> of a Crown; &s;o that by reckoning 5 <HI>te&s;tons</HI> to a Crown or <HI>E&s;cu</HI> (as it is but 2 <HI>d.</HI> over) the&s;e Officers mu&s;t collect five times the money which they pay the King, which amounteth to 75 millions, and is not much &s;hort of that proportion which before I &s;pake of. The Kings Revenues then, notwith&s;tanding this infinite oppre&s;|&s;ion of his people, amounteth to 15 millions (&s;ome would have it 18.) which is a good improvement in re&s;pect of what they were in times a&s;ore. <HI>Lewis</HI> the XI. as good a husband of his Crown, as ever any was in <HI>France,</HI> gather|ing but one and a half only. But as you reckon the flood, &s;o al&s;o if you may reckon the ebb ofhis Trea&s;ures, you will finde much wanting of a full &s;ea in his Coffers; it be|ing
<PB N="271" REF="160">
generally known, that the fees of officers, pen&s;ions, gar|ri&s;ons, and the men of armes, draw from him yearly no fewer then 6 of his 15 millions.</P>
<P>True it is, that his Trea&s;ure hath many good helps by way of E&s;cheat, and that mo&s;t frequently, when he cometh to take an accompt of his Trea&s;urers and other Officers. A Nation &s;o abominably full of ba&s;e and unmanly villaines in their &s;everall charges, that the <HI>Publicans</HI> of <HI>Old-Rome,</HI> were milke and white-broath to them. For &s;o mi&s;erably do they abu&s;e the poor Pai&s;ant, that if he hath in all the world but eight Sols, it &s;hall go hard, but he will extort from him five of them.

He is ju&s;t of the nature of the Hor&s;e-leech, when he hath once gotten hold of you, he will never let you go till he be filled. And which is mo&s;t &s;trange, he thinks it a greater clemency that he hath le&s;t the poor man &s;ome of his money, then the injury was in wre&s;ting from him the re&s;t. Nay they will brag of it, when they have taken but five of the eight Sols, that they have given him three, and expect thanks for it. A kindne&s;&s;e of a very theevi&s;h nature, it being the condi|tion of Robbers, as <HI>Tully</HI> hath ob&s;erved, <HI>Ut commemorent iis &s;e dedi&s;&s;e vitam, quibus non ademerint.</HI> Were the people but &s;o happy, as to have a certain rate &s;et upon their mi&s;eries, it could not but be a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e to them, and would well defend them from the tyrany of the&s;e Theeves. But (which is not the lea&s;t part of their wretchedne&s;&s;e) their Taxings and A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements are left arbitrary, and are exacted accor|dingly as the&s;e Publicans will give out of the Kings ne|ce&s;&s;ities; &s;o that the Countryman hath no other remedy, then to give <HI>Cerberus</HI> a cru&s;t, as the &s;aying is, to ki&s;&s;e his rod and hug his puni&s;hment. By this means the Que&s;tors thrive abundantly, it being commonly &s;aid of them, <HI>Heri bouvier aviourdhui chevalier,</HI> to day a Swine-heard, to mor|row a Gentleman; and certainly they grow into great riches. Mr. <HI>Beaumarchais</HI> one of the Trea&s;urers (Mr. <HI>De Vilroy,</HI> who &s;lew the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>D' Ancre,</HI> marryed his only

Daughter) having raked unto him&s;elf, by the villanous abu&s;e of his place, no le&s;&s;e then 22 millions of Livres, as it was commonly reported. But he is not like to carry it to his grave, the King having &s;eized upon a good part of it, and him&s;elf being condemned to the gallowes by the grand <HI>Chambre</HI> of Parliament, though as yet he cannot be apprehended and advanced to the Ladder. And this hath been the end of many of them, &s;ince the reign of this pre&s;ent King, whom (it may be) for this cau&s;e, they call <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>ju&s;t.</HI> This fa&s;hion of affixing Epithites to the names of their Kings was in great u&s;e heretofore with this Nation. <HI>Carolus</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Pepin,</HI> was by them &s;ur|named <HI>Le Magne: Lewis</HI> his &s;on <HI>Debonaire,</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t.

<P>Let us add one more mi&s;ery to the State and com|monalty of <HI>France,</HI> and that is, the ba&s;e and corrupt money in it.

The&s;e are the common coynes of the Countrey; &s;ilver and gold not being to be &s;een but upon holydayes. As for their &s;ilver, it is mo&s;t of it of their own coyning, but all exceeding clipt and &s;haven; their gold be|ing mo&s;t of it <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> In my little being in the Countrey, though I ca&s;ually &s;aw much gold, I could only &s;ee two

Were the King as Ca|tholick as his money, I think I &s;hould be in &s;ome fear of him, till then we may lawfully take that ambitious title from the King, and be&s;tow it upon his pictures. The Soveraignty of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gold is more univer&s;ally em|braced, and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> acknowledged in mo&s;t parts of Chri&s;tendome, then that of him which &s;tampt it. To this he which entituleth him&s;elf Catholick is but a pri&s;oner, and never &s;aw half tho&s;e Provinces, in which this more powerfull Monarch hath been heartily welcomed. Yet if he will needs be King, let him grow &s;omewhat more jealous of his Queen, and confe&s;&s;e that his gold doth royally de&s;erve his imbraces, whom before the extent of his dominion, the Ancient Poets &s;tyled <HI>Regina pecunia.</HI> True it is, that by the figure and &s;hape of this Empere&s;&s;e, you would little think her to be lovely, and le&s;&s;e worthy of your imbracement. The &s;tones which little boyes break into Quoits, are a great deal better proportioned; if a <HI>Geometrician</HI> were to take the angles of it, I think it would quite put him be|&s;ides his <HI>Euclide;</HI> neither can I tell to what thing in the world fitter to re&s;emble it, then a <HI>French</HI> Chee&s;e; for it is neither long, nor &s;quare, nor round, nor thin, nor thick, nor any one of the&s;e, but yet all, and yet none of them. No que&s;tion, but it was the Kings de&s;ires, by this un&s;ight|ly dre&s;&s;ing of his Lady, to make men out of love with her, that &s;o he might keep her to him&s;elf.

<P>(1) The occa&s;ion of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (2) Introduction to this Work. (3) The Dedication, (4) and Method of the whole. The beginning, continuance of our Voyage; with the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages which hapned in it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen fir&s;t I undertook to attend upon my Lord of <HI>Danby</HI> to the I&s;lands of <HI>Guernzey</HI> and <HI>Jar&s;ey;</HI> be&s;ides the purpo&s;e which I had of doing &s;ervice to his Lord&s;hip, I re&s;olved al&s;o to do &s;omewhat for my &s;elf: and, if po&s;&s;ible, unto the places. For my &s;elf, in bettering&punc;
<PB N="280" REF="165">
what I could my under&s;tanding, if peradventure the per&s;ons or the place might add unto me the knowledge of any one thing, to which I was a &s;tranger. At the lea&s;t I was in hope to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, as being not a little emulous of this kind of living, <HI>Multorum mores hominum qui vidit &amp; urbes;</HI> which had &s;een &s;o much of men and of their manners. It was al&s;o not the la&s;t part of mine intention, to do &s;omething in the honour of the I&s;land, by committing to memory their Antiquities, by reporting to po&s;terity their Arts of Government, by repre&s;enting, as in a Tablet, the choyce&s;t of their beauties; and in a word, by reducing the&s;e and the Achievements of the people, as far as the light of Authors could direct me, into the body of an Hi&s;tory. But when I had a little made my &s;elf acquainted with the place and people, I found nothing in them which might put me to that trouble. The Churches naked of all Monuments, and not &s;o much as the blazon of an Armes permitted in a win|dow, for fear, as I conjecture, of Idolatry. No actions of importance to be heard of in their Legends, in their re|membrancers; whereby to ennoble them in time to come, unle&s;&s;e perhaps &s;ome &s;light allarmes from <HI>France,</HI> may occa|&s;ion &s;peech of them in our common Chronicles. The Coun|trey, indeed, exceeding plea&s;ant and delight&s;ome, but yet &s;o &s;mall in the extent and circuit, that to &s;peak much of them, wereto put the &s;hooe of <HI>Hercules</HI> upon the foot of an Infant. For being in them&s;elves, an abridgement only of the greater works of nature, how could the character and de&s;cription of them be improved into a Volume? Having thus failed in the mo&s;t of my de&s;ignes, I applyed my &s;elf to make enquirie after their form of Government, in which, I mu&s;t needs confe&s;&s;e, I met with much which did exceedingly affect me. Their Lawes, little beholding in the compo&s;ition of them, to <HI>Ju&s;tinian;</HI> and of no great af|finity with the laws of <HI>England,</HI> which we call Municipall or common. The grand Cu&s;tomarie of <HI>Normandy,</HI> is of mo&s;t credit with them; and that indeed the only rule by which they are directed, &s;ave that in &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages it hath been al|tered by our Prince, for the conveniency of this people.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="165">
<HI>Sed quid hoc ad Iphycli boves?</HI> But what had I, a Prie&s;t of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to do with the Laws and Cu&s;tomes of the <HI>Normans?</HI> Had I gone forward in my purpo&s;e, I deny not, but I had mingled that knowledge which I have gotten of their Laws, among&s;t other my Collections; but failing in the main of my intent, I mu&s;t only make &s;uch u&s;e of them, as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for this pre&s;ent argument. An Argument not &s;o much as in my thoughts, when fir&s;t I re&s;olved upon the Journey; as little dreaming that any alterations had lately hapned in the Churches of tho&s;e I&s;lands, or that tho&s;e alterations could afford one &s;uch varie|ty. An Argument more &s;utable to my profe&s;&s;ion, as having had the honour to be reputed with the Clergy; and &s;uch as in it &s;elf may ju&s;tly be intituled to your Lord&s;hips patro|nage. God and the King have rai&s;ed you above your bre|thren to be a Ma&s;ter in our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a principall pillar in the glorious &s;tructure of the Church. An advancement which doth call upon you for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upportation of the meane&s;t Oratory dependant on the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> your mo&s;t indulgent, and in you mo&s;t happy mother. No marvail therefore, if tho&s;e little Chappels, even tho&s;e two Tribes and a half, which are on the other &s;ide of the flood, mo&s;t humbly ca&s;t them&s;elves at your Lord&s;hips feet, and by me lay open their e&s;tate unto you.</P>
<P>Which that I may the better do, in di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, and for your Lord&s;hips, more ample &s;atisfacti|on I &s;hall proceed in this order following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;hall lay before your Lord&s;hip, the full &s;ucce&s;&s;e and cour&s;e of our Navigation, till we were &s;etled in tho&s;e I&s;lands; that &s;o the re&s;t of this di&s;cour&s;e being more ma|teriall, may receive no interruption in the proce&s;&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Next, I &s;hall briefly, as in a map, pre&s;ent your Lord|&s;hip with the &s;ituation, quality and &s;tory of the I&s;lands; with &s;omewhat al&s;o of their Cu&s;tomes, of their Government; but this (as the great Cardinall acknowledgeth the Popes power in temporall affaires) <HI>in ordine tantum ad &s;piritualia:</HI> the better to acquaint you with the occurrents of their Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="166">
That done, I &s;hall draw down the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of their af|fairs from the beginning of the Reformation in matters of Religion, to the accompli&s;hment of that innovation which they had made in point of di&s;cipline; and therein, the full platforme or di&s;cipline it &s;elf, according as by <HI>Snape</HI> and <HI>Cartwright</HI> it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in their Synods.</P>
<P>In the third place, I &s;hall &s;hew your Lord&s;hip, by what degrees and means the Mini&s;ters and Church of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> were per&s;waded to conforme unto the di&s;cipline of <HI>England;</HI> to|gether with a copy of tho&s;e Canons and con&s;titutions Eccle|&s;ia&s;ticall, whereby the Church and Mini&s;tery of that I&s;land is now governed.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, I &s;hall commence a &s;uit unto your Lord|&s;hip in the name of tho&s;e of <HI>Guernzey</HI> for their <HI>little &s;i&s;ter which hath no brea&s;ts;</HI> that by your Lord&s;hips place and power the one I&s;land may conforme unto the other, and both to <HI>England.</HI> In which I &s;hall exhibit unto your Lord|&s;hip a ju&s;t &s;urvey of &s;uch motives, which may have mo&s;t &s;way with you in the furthering of a work &s;o commenda|ble; and &s;hall adventure al&s;o upon &s;uch particulars, as may conduce to the advancing of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. Not that therein I &s;hall pre&s;ume po&s;itively to advi&s;e your Lord&s;hip, or to di|rect you in the readie&s;t way for the accompli&s;hment of this de&s;igne; but that by this propounding of mine own conceits, I may excite your Lord&s;hip to have recour&s;e unto the excel|lent trea&s;ures of your own mind, and thence to fa&s;hion &s;uch particulars for this purpo&s;e, as may be mo&s;t agreeable to your Lord&s;hips wi&s;dome.</P>
<P>In order whereunto your Lord&s;hip may be plea&s;ed to call to mind that on provocation given unto the <HI>French</HI> at the I&s;le of <HI>Rhe,</HI> the King received adverti&s;ement of &s;ome reci|procall affront intended by the <HI>French</HI> on the I&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guernzey,</HI> with others thereupon appendant, the only re|mainders of the Dukedome of <HI>Normandy</HI> in the power of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that for the preventing of &s;uch inconveniences as might follow on it, it was thought good to &s;end the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> (then Governour of the I&s;le of <HI>Guernzey)</HI> with a con|&s;iderable &s;upply of Men, and Armes, and Ammunition to make good tho&s;e I&s;lands, by fortifying and a&s;&s;uring them

again&s;t all inva&s;ions. This order &s;ignified to his Lord&s;hip about the beginning of <HI>December, anno</HI> 1628. he chearfully embraced the &s;ervice, and prepared accordingly. But being de&s;erted by his own Chaplaines in regard of the extremi|ty of the &s;ea&s;on, and the vi&s;ible danger of the enterpri&s;e, he propo&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of that attendance unto me (not otherwi&s;e relating to him then as to an honourable friend) in whom he found as great a readine&s;&s;e and re&s;olution, as he found coldne&s;&s;e in the other. According to his Lord&s;hips &s;ummons, I attended him in his Maje&s;ties hou&s;e of St. <HI>James,</HI> a little before the Fea&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> but neither the Ships, money, nor other nece&s;&s;aries being at that time brought to|gether, I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed again at the end of the Holydayes, untill a further intimation of his Lord&s;hips plea&s;ure. Toward the latter end of <HI>February</HI> I received a po&s;itive command to attend his Lord&s;hip on Friday the 20 of that month, at the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Arthur Brumfeild,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Tichfeild</HI> near the Sea, &s;ituate between <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and <HI>South|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ampton;</HI> whither accordingly I went, and where I found a very chearfull entertainment. It was a full week after that, before we heard of his Lord&s;hips coming, and yet his Lord&s;hip was fain to tarry two or three dayes before he had any adverti&s;ement that his Ships, Men and Ammunition (which he thought to have found there in readine&s;&s;e) were Anchored in the road of <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> News whereof being brought unto us on the Monday morning, we &s;pent the re|mainder of that day in preparations for our Journey, and taking leave of tho&s;e good friends by whom we were &s;o kind|ly entertained and welcomed.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day <HI>March</HI> the 3. about ten in the morning, we went aboard his Maje&s;ties Ship called the <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> being a Ship of 800 tun, furni&s;hed with 42 pieces of Ordinance, and very well manned with valiant and expert Sailors; welcomed aboard (after the fa&s;hion of the Sea) with all the thunder and lightning which the whole Navy could afford from their &s;everall Ships. Our whole Navy con&s;i&s;ted of five Ve&s;&s;els, that is to &s;ay, the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> &s;poken of before, two of his Maje&s;ties <HI>Pinnaces</HI> called the <HI>Whelps,</HI> a <HI>Catch</HI> of his Maje&s;ties called the <HI>Minikin,</HI> and a Merchants &s;hip called
<PB N="284" REF="167">
the <HI>Charles,</HI> which carryed the Armes and Ammunition for the u&s;e of the I&s;lands. Aboard the Ships were &s;towed about 400 foot with their &s;everall Officers, two Companies where|of under the command of Collonell <HI>Pipernell</HI> (if I remember his name aright) and Lieutenant Collonell <HI>Francis Connisby</HI> were intended for the I&s;le of <HI>Guernzey;</HI> the other two under the command of Lieutenant Collonell <HI>Francis Rainford,</HI> and Captain <HI>William Killegre</HI> for the I&s;le of <HI>Jar&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</HI> The Admirall of our Navy (but in &s;ubordination to his Lord&s;hip when he was at Sea) was Sir <HI>Henry Palmer</HI> one of the Admirals or the Narrow-&s;eas. All of them men of note in their &s;e|verall wayes, and mo&s;t of them of as much gallantry and ingenuity, as either their own birth or education in the Schoole of war could inve&s;t them with. The Sea was very calme and quiet, and the little breath of winde we had, made us move &s;o &s;lowly, that the afternoon was almo&s;t &s;pent be|fore we had pa&s;&s;ed through the Needles, a dangerous pa&s;|&s;age at all times, except to &s;uch only who being well skilled in the&s;e &s;harpe points, and tho&s;e dreadfull fragments of the Rocks, which &s;o intituled them, could &s;tear a &s;teady cour&s;e between them: <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> in old times, nothing more terrible to the unskilled Mariners of tho&s;e dayes, then tho&s;e Rocks to ours. Being got beyond them at the la&s;t, though we had got more Sea roome, we had little more winde, which made us move as &s;lowly as before we did, &s;o that we &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the night with no &s;wifter motion, then what was given us by the tide. About 3 of the clock in the morning we had winde enough, but we had it directly in our teeth, which would have quickly brought us to the place we had parted from, if a great Mi&s;te ari&s;ing toge|ther with the Sun, had not induced our Mariners to keep them&s;elves aloofe in the open Sea for fear of falling on tho&s;e Rocks wherewith the South&s;ide of the <HI>Wight</HI> is made unac|ce&s;&s;able. About 2 of the clock in the afternoon, the winds turning &s;omewhat Ea&s;tward, we made on again, but with &s;o little &s;peed, and to &s;o little purpo&s;e, that all that night we were fain to lie at <HI>Hull</HI> (as the Mariners phra&s;e it) without any &s;en&s;ible moving either backward or forward, but &s;o un|ea&s;ily withall, that it mu&s;t be a very great tempe&s;t indeed,
<PB N="285" REF="167">
which gives a pa&s;&s;enger a more &s;ickly and unplea&s;ing mo|tion. For my part I had found my &s;elf good Sea-proof in my Voyage to <HI>France,</HI> and was not much troubled with tho&s;e di&s;turbances to which the greate&s;t part of our Land-men were &s;o &s;en&s;ibly &s;ubject. On Thur&s;day morning about day|break being within &s;ight of <HI>Portland,</HI> and the winde &s;erving very fitly, we made again for the I&s;lands. At 11 of the clock we di&s;covered the main Land of <HI>Normandy,</HI> called by the Mariners <HI>Le Haggs.</HI> About 2 in the afternoon, we fell even with <HI>Aldernie</HI> or <HI>Aurnie;</HI> and about 3 di&s;cerned the I&s;le of <HI>Jarzey</HI> to which we were bound, at which we aimed, and to which we might have come much &s;ooner then we did had we not found a &s;peciall entertainment by the way to retard our ha&s;te. For we were hardly got within &s;ight of <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> but we de&s;cried a &s;ail of <HI>French</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of ten barks laden with very good <HI>Ga&s;coy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ne</HI> Wines, and good choyce of Linen (as they told us afterwards) bound from St. <HI>Malloes</HI> to <HI>New-Haven</HI> for the trade of <HI>Paris,</HI> and convoyed by a <HI>Holland-man of war,</HI> for their &s;afer pa&s;|&s;age. The&s;e being looked on as good prize, our two <HI>Whelpes</HI> and the <HI>Catch</HI> gave chace unto them, a great &s;hot being fir&s;t made from our Admirals Ship to call them in. The &s;econd &s;hot brought in the <HI>Holland man of war,</HI> who very &s;ordidly and ba&s;ely betrayed his charge before he came within reach of danger; the re&s;t for the greate&s;t part of the afternoon, &s;pun before the winde, &s;ometimes &s;o neer to their pur&s;uers, that we thought them ours, but pre&s;ently tacking about, when our <HI>Whelpes</HI> were ready to &s;eaze on them, and the <HI>Catch</HI> to lay fa&s;t hold upon them, they gained more way then our light Ve&s;&s;els could reco|ver in a long time after. Never did Duck by frequent di|ving &s;o e&s;cape the Spaniell, or Hare by often turning &s;o avoid the Hounds, as the&s;e poor Barks did quit them&s;elves by their dexterity in &s;ailing from the pre&s;ent danger. For my part I may ju&s;tly &s;ay that I never &s;pent an afternoon with greater plea&s;ure, the greater in regard that I knew his Lord|&s;hips re&s;olution to deal favourably with tho&s;e poor men if they chanced to fall into his power. Certain I am, that
<PB N="286" REF="168">
the de&s;cription made by <HI>Ovid</HI> of the Hare and Hound, was here fully veryfied, but farre more excellently in the application then the fir&s;t originall; of which thus the Poet:</P>

<P>But at the la&s;t a little before the clo&s;e of the evening, three of them being borded and brought under Lee of our Ad|mirall, the re&s;t were put to a nece&s;&s;ity of yeelding, or venturing them&s;elves between our two great &s;hips and the &s;hoar of <HI>Jar&s;ey,</HI> to which we were now come as near as we could with &s;afety. Re&s;olved upon the la&s;t cour&s;e and favoured with a &s;trong leading gale, they pa&s;&s;ed by us with &s;uch &s;peed and &s;o good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, (the duskine&s;&s;e of the evening contributing not a little to a fair e&s;cape) that though we gave them 30 &s;hot, yet we were not able to affirme that they received any hurt or dammage by that en|counter; with as much joy unto my &s;elf (I dare boldly &s;ay) as to any of tho&s;e poor men who were &s;o much in|tere&s;&s;ed
<PB N="287" REF="168">
in it. This Cha&s;e being over, and our whole Fleet come together, we Anchored that night in the Port of St. <HI>Oen,</HI> one of the principall Ports of that I&s;land; the Inhabitants whereof (but tho&s;e e&s;pecially which dwel|led in the inland parts) &s;tanding all night upon their guard, conceiving by the thunder of &s;o many great &s;hot, that the whole powers of <HI>France</HI> and the Devill to boot were now falling upon them; not fully &s;atisfied in their fears, till by the next ri&s;ing of the Sun they de&s;cried our colours.</P>
<P>On Friday <HI>March</HI> the 6. about nine in the morning (having fir&s;t landed our foot in the long boats) we went aboard his Maje&s;ties <HI>Catch</HI> called the <HI>Minikin,</HI> and doub|ling the points of <HI>Le Corbiere</HI> and of <HI>Normoint,</HI> we went on &s;hoar in the Bay of St. <HI>Heliers,</HI> neer unto <HI>Mount St. Albin</HI> in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Peter.</HI> The greate&s;t part of which day we &s;pent in accommodations and refre&s;hments, and receiving the vi&s;its of the Gentry which came in very frequently to attend his Lord&s;hip. You need not think, but that &s;leep and a good bed were welcome to us, after &s;o long and ill a pa&s;&s;age; &s;o that it was very near high noon before his Lord&s;hip was capable to receive our &s;ervices, or we to give him our atten|dance; after dinner his Lord&s;hip went to view the Fort <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (the chief &s;trength of the I&s;land) and to take order for the fortifying and repair thereof. Which having done he fir&s;t &s;ecured the Man of War and the three <HI>French</HI> Barks, under the command of that Ca&s;tle; and then gave leave to Sir <HI>Henry Palmer</HI> and the re&s;t of the &s;ea Captains to take their plea&s;ures in Forraging and &s;oowring all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>France,</HI> which day near the I&s;lands, commanding them to attend him on the Saturday following. Next he gave liberty to all the <HI>French</HI> which he had taken the day before, whom he cau&s;ed to be landed in their own Countrie, to their great rejoycing, as appeared by the great &s;hout they made when they were put into &s;ome long boats at their own di&s;po&s;ing. The three Barks &s;till re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">ing untouched in the &s;tate they were, &s;ave that &s;ome wines were taken out of them for his Lord&s;hips &s;pending.

ordered, that the people of the Town of St. <HI>Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ers</HI> &s;hould have their divine offices in that Church performed &s;o early, that it might be left wholly for the u&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by nine of the clock, about which time his Lord&s;hip attended by the Officers and Souldiers in a &s;olemn Mi|litary pompe (accompanied with the Governours of the Town and chief men of the I&s;land) went toward the Church, where I officiated Divine Service according to the pre&s;cript form of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and after preached on tho&s;e words of <HI>David, P&s;al. 31. 51. viz. Offer unto God thanksgiving,</HI> &amp;c. with reference to the good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of our Voyage pa&s;t, and hopes of the like mercies for the time to come. The next day, we made a Journey to <HI>Mount Orgueil,</HI> where we were entertained by the Lady <HI>Carteret</HI> (a Daughter of Sir <HI>Francis Dou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Hamp&s;hire)</HI> And after Dinner his Lord&s;hip went to take a view of the Regiment of Mr. <HI>Jo&s;uah de Carteret, Sei|gnieur de la Trinity,</HI> mu&s;tering upon the Green upon <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re de Bowle</HI> in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Trinitie.</HI> On Tue&s;day, <HI>March</HI> the 10. his Lord&s;hip took a view of the Regi|ment of Mr. <HI>Aron Mi&s;&s;ervie</HI> Col. and on Wedne&s;day, <HI>March</HI> the 11. went unto St. <HI>Oen,</HI> where we were fea|&s;ted by Sir <HI>Philip de Carteret,</HI> who&s;e Regiment we like|wi&s;e viewed in the afternoon.

<P>The only bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of that day was the di&s;po&s;ing of the three Barks which we took in our Journey, the goods whereof having before been inventoried and ap|prized by &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Town, and now expo&s;ed to open &s;ale, were for the mo&s;t part, bought together with the Barks them&s;elves by that very <HI>Holland man of warre,</HI> whom they had hired to be their Convoy: Which gave me &s;uch a Character of the mercenary and &s;ordid nature of that people, that of all men living, I &s;hould never de&s;ire to have any thing to do with them, unle&s;&s;e they might be made u&s;e of (as the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> were) in <HI>hewing wood, and drawing water for the u&s;e of the Tabernacle;</HI> I mean in doing &s;ervile offices to &s;ome mightier State which would be &s;ure to keep them under.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO begin then with the places them&s;elves, the Scene and Stage of our di&s;cour&s;e, they are the only remain|ders of our rights in <HI>Normandy;</HI> unto which Duke|dome they did once belong. <HI>Anno</HI> 1108. at &s;uch time as <HI>Henry</HI> I. of <HI>England</HI> had taken pri&s;oner his Brother <HI>Robert,</HI> the&s;e I&s;lands as a part of <HI>Normandy,</HI> were annext unto the
<PB N="293" REF="171">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, and have ever &s;ince with great te&s;timony of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aith and loyalty, continued in that &s;ubjection. The &s;entence or arre&s;t of confi&s;cation given by the Parliament of <HI>France</HI> again&s;t King <HI>John,</HI> nor the &s;urpri&s;all of <HI>Norman|dy</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> forces, could be no per&s;wa&s;ion unto them to change their Ma&s;ters. Nay when the <HI>French</HI> had twice &s;eized on them, during the Reign of that unhappy Prince, and the &s;tate of <HI>England</HI> was embroyled at home, the people valiantly made good their own, and faithfully returned un|to their fir&s;t obedience. In aftertimes as any war grew hot between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> the&s;e I&s;lands were principally aimed at by the enemy, and &s;ometimes al&s;o were attempted by them, but with ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e. And certainly, it could not be but an eye &s;ore to the <HI>French,</HI> to have the&s;e <HI>I&s;les</HI> within their &s;ight, and not within their power; to &s;ee them at the lea&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient enemy the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> a Nation &s;trong in &s;hipping, and likely by the op|portunity of the&s;e places to annoy their trade. For if we look upon them in their &s;ituation, we &s;hall find them &s;eated purpo&s;ely for the command and Empire of the Ocean. The I&s;lands lying in the chief trade of all &s;hipping from the Ea&s;tern parts unto the We&s;t, and in the middle way between St. <HI>Malos</HI> and the river <HI>Seine,</HI> the only trafick of the <HI>Nor|mans</HI> and <HI>Pari&s;ians.</HI> At this St. <HI>Malos,</HI> as at a common <HI>Empory</HI> do the Merchants of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> barter their Commodities; the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> making both their pa&s;&s;age and return by the&s;e I&s;les; which if wel aided by a &s;mal power from the Kings Navy, would quickly bring that entercour&s;e to nothing. An opportunity neglected by our former Kings in their attempts upon that Nation, at not being then &s;o powerfull on the Seas as now they are, but likely for the future to be husbanded to the be&s;t advantage, if the <HI>French</HI> hereafter &s;tir again&s;t us. Sure I am, that my Lord of <HI>Danby</HI> conceived this cour&s;e of all others to be the fitte&s;t, for the impoveri&s;hing if not undoing of the <HI>French;</HI> and according|ly made propo&s;ition by his Letters to the Councell, that a &s;quadron of eight Ships <HI>(viz</HI> five of the <HI>Whelpes,</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> the <HI>Adventure</HI> and the <HI>Catch)</HI> might be employed about the&s;e I&s;lands for that purpo&s;e. An advice which had this Summer
<PB N="294" REF="172">
took effect, had not the Peace between both Realms, been &s;o &s;uddenly concluded.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, four only are inhabited, and tho&s;e reduced only unto two Governments; <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> an entire Province as it were within it &s;elf; but that of <HI>Gueruzey</HI> having the other two of <HI>Alderney</HI> and <HI>Serke</HI> dependant on it. Hence it is, that in our Hi&s;tories, and in our Acts of Parliament, we have men|tion only of <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> and of <HI>Guernzey,</HI> this la&s;t comprehending under it the two other. The people of them all live as it were in <HI>libera custodia,</HI> in a kind of free &s;ubjection; not any way acquainted with Taxes, or with any levies either of men or money. In &s;o much, that when the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> contribute towards the occa&s;ion of their Princes, there is al|wayes a provi&s;o in the Act, <Q>That this grant of Sub&s;idies or any thing therein contained, extend not to charge the inhabitants of <HI>Guernzey</HI> and <HI>Jar&s;ey,</HI> or any of them, of, for or concerning any Mannors, Lands, and Tenements, or other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Goods, Chattels, or other moveable &s;ub&s;tance, which they the &s;aid Inhabitants, or any other to their u&s;es, have within <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guernzey,</HI> or in any of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> The&s;e priviledges and immunities (together with divers others) &s;econded of late dayes with the more powerfull band of Religion, have been a principall occa|&s;ion of that con&s;tancy, wherewith they have per&s;i&s;ted faith|fully in their allegiance, and di&s;claimed even the very name and thought of <HI>France.</HI> For how&s;oever the language which they &s;peak is <HI>French,</HI> and that in their originall, they either were of <HI>Normandy</HI> or <HI>Britagne;</HI> yet can they with no patience endure to be accounted <HI>French,</HI> but call them&s;elves by the names of <HI>Engli&s;h-Normans.</HI> So much doth liberty, or at the wor&s;t a gentle yoak, prevail upon the mind and fancy of the people.</P>
<P>To proceed unto particulars, we will take them as they lie in order, beginning fir&s;t with that of <HI>Alderney,</HI> an I&s;land called by <HI>Antonine, Arica,</HI> but by the <HI>French</HI> and in our old Records known by the name of <HI>Aurigny</HI> and <HI>Aurney.</HI> It is &s;ituate in the 49 degree between 48 &amp; 52 minutes of that de|gree, ju&s;t over again&s;t the Cape or promontory of the <HI>Lexobii,</HI> called at this time by the Mariners the <HI>Hague.</HI> Di&s;tant from

this Cape or Promontory three leagues only, but thirty at the lea&s;t from the neare&s;t part of <HI>England.</HI> The aire healthy, though &s;ometimes thickned with the vapours ari&s;ing from the Sea. The &s;oil indifferently rich both for husbandry and gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing. A Town it hath of well-near an hundred fa|milies, and not far off, an haven made in the manner of a &s;emicircle, which they call <HI>Crabbie.</HI> The principall &s;trength of it, are the high rocks, with which it is on every &s;ide envi|roned, but e&s;pecially upon the South; and on the Ea&s;t &s;ide an old Block hou&s;e, which time hath made almo&s;t un&s;er|viceable. The chief hou&s;e herein belongeth unto the <HI>Cham|berlains,</HI> as al&s;o the dominion or Fee-farme of all the I&s;land, it being granted by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> unto <HI>George</HI> the &s;on of Sir <HI>Leonard Chamberlain,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Guernzey,</HI> by who&s;e valour it was recovered from the <HI>French,</HI> who in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> dayes had &s;eized upon it. Neer unto the Fort or Block-hou&s;e afore mentioned, a great quantity of this little I&s;land is overlaid with &s;and, driven thither by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ury of the Northwe&s;t-winde. If we believe their Legends, it proceeded from the ju&s;t judgement of God upon the owner of tho&s;e grounds, who once (but when I know not) had made booty and put unto the Sword &s;ome certain <HI>Spaniards,</HI> there &s;hipwracked.</P>
<P>Four leagues from hence, and to the Southwe&s;t and by we&s;t, lyeth another of the &s;maller I&s;lands, called <HI>Serke;</HI> &s;ix miles in circuit at the lea&s;t, which yet is two miles le&s;&s;er in the whole compa&s;&s;e then that of <HI>Alderney.</HI> An I&s;le not known at all by any name among&s;t the Antients, and no marvail, for till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">h of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> or thereabou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, it was not peopled. But then, it plea&s;ed her Maje&s;ty to grant it for ever in Fee farme to <HI>Helier de Carteret,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Seigneur de St. Oen,</HI> a principall Gentleman of the I&s;le of <HI>Jar&s;ey,</HI> and Grandfather to Sir <HI>Philip de Carteret</HI> now living. By him it was divided into &s;everall e&s;tates, and lea&s;ed out unto divers Tenants, collected from the neigh|bour I&s;lands, &s;o that at this day it may contain &s;ome forty hou&s;holds; whereas before it contained only a poor her|mitage, together with a little Chappell appertaining to it; the re&s;t of the ground &s;erving as a Common unto tho&s;e

<P>During the reign of the late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who for her husband <HI>Philips</HI> &s;ake, had engaged her &s;elf in a war again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> this I&s;land then not peopled, was &s;uddenly &s;urprized by tho&s;e of that Nation, but by a Gentleman of the Netherlands, a &s;ubject of King <HI>Philips</HI> thus regained, as the &s;tory much to this purpo&s;e is related by Sir <HI>Wal. Raleigh.</HI> The <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Gentleman with a &s;mall Bark came to Anchor in the road, and pretending the death of his Merchant, be&s;ought the <HI>French</HI> that they might bury him in the Chappell of that I&s;land, offering a pre&s;ent to them of &s;uch commodity as they had aboard. To this reque&s;t the <HI>French</HI> were ea&s;ily entreated, but yet upon condition that they &s;hould not come on &s;hoar with any weapon, no not &s;o much as with a knife. This leave obtained, the <HI>Fleming</HI> rowed unto the &s;hoar with a Coffin in their Skiffe for that u&s;e purpo&s;ely provided, and manned with Swords and Arcubui&s;hes. Upon their landing, and a &s;earch &s;o &s;trict and narrow, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to hide a pen-knife; they were permitted to draw their Coffin up the Rocks, &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> rowing back unto the Ship to fetch the pre&s;ent, where they were &s;oon made fa&s;t enough and laid in hold. The <HI>Flemings</HI> in the mean time which were on land, had carryed their Coffin into the Chappell, and having taken thence their weapons, gave an alarme upon the <HI>French,</HI> who taken thus upon the &s;uddain, and &s;eeing no hopes of &s;uccour from their fellowes, yeelded them&s;elves, and abandoned the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place.

And certainly it is more then nece&s;&s;ary that this place &s;hould be thus fortified, if not for the &s;afety of the I&s;land, yet at the lea&s;t for the a&s;&s;urance of the Harbour. An harbour able to contain the greate&s;t Navy that ever failed upon the Ocean; fenced from the fury of the winds by the I&s;les of <HI>Guernzey, Jet-how, Serke</HI> and <HI>Arvie,</HI> by which it is almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed; and of &s;o &s;ure an anchorage, that though our Ships lay there in the blu&s;tering end of <HI>March,</HI> yet it was noted that never any of them &s;lipped an anchour. Other Havens they have about the I&s;land, <HI>viz. Bazon, L' Aucre&s;&s;e, Fermines</HI> and <HI>others;</HI> but the&s;e rather landing places to let in the Enemy, then any way advantageous to the trade and riches of the people. A place not to be neglected in the defence of it; and full of danger to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> State and Trafick, were it in the hands of any enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the notable advantage of this harbour, and the con|veniency of the Peer &s;o neer unto it, which is al&s;o warran|ted with &s;ix peece of good Canon from the Town; it is no marvell if the people betake them&s;elves &s;o much unto the trade of Merchandi&s;e. Nor do they trafick only in &s;mall boats between St <HI>Malos</HI> and the I&s;lands, as tho&s;e of <HI>Jar&s;ey;</HI> but are Ma&s;ters of good &s;tout Barks, and venture unto all the&s;e neerer Ports of Chri&s;tendom. The principall commo|dity which they u&s;e to &s;end abroad, are the works and la|bours of the poorer &s;ort, as Wa&s;t-cotes, Stockins, and other manufactures made of wool, wherein they are exceeding cunning; of which wooll to be tran&s;ported to their I&s;land in a certain proportion, they lately have obtained a licence of our Princes. But there accreweth a further benefit unto
<PB N="300" REF="175">
this people, from their harbour then their own trafick, which is the continuall concour&s;e and re&s;ort of Merchants thither, e&s;pecially upon the noi&s;e or being of a War. For by an an|tient priviledge of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> there is with them in a manner a continuall truce; and lawfull it is both for <HI>French</HI> men and for others, how hot &s;oever the war be followed in other parts, to repair hither without danger, and here to trade in all &s;ecurity. A priviledge founded upon a Bull of Pope <HI>Six|tus</HI> IV. the 10 year, as I remember, of his Popedom; <HI>Edward</HI> IV. then reigning in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. over the <HI>French:</HI> by virtue of which Bull, all tho&s;e &s;tand <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> excommu|nicate, which any way mole&s;t the Inhabitants of this I&s;le of <HI>Guerazey,</HI> or any which re&s;ort unto their I&s;land, either by Piracy or any other violence what&s;oever. A Bull fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the City of <HI>Constance,</HI> unto who&s;e Dioce&s;&s;e the&s;e I&s;lands once belonged, afterwards verifyed by the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and confirmed by our Kings of <HI>England</HI> till this day. The copy of this Bull my &s;elf have &s;een, and &s;ome|what al&s;o in the practi&s;e of it on record; by which it doth appear, that a man of war of <HI>France</HI> having taken an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip, and therein &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers and goods of <HI>Guern|zey;</HI> made prize and pri&s;oners of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but re|&s;tored the&s;e of <HI>Guernzey</HI> to their liberty and to their own.</P>
<P>And now at la&s;t after a long pa&s;&s;age, and through many difficulties, we are Anchored in the I&s;le of <HI>Jar&s;ey;</HI> known in the former ages, and to <HI>Antonine</HI> the Emperor, by the name of <HI>Ce&s;area.</HI> An I&s;land &s;ituate in the 49 degree of Latitude, between the 18 and 24 minutes of that degree; di&s;tant 5 leagues only from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Normandy,</HI> 40 or thereabouts from the neere&s;t parts of <HI>England,</HI> and 6 or 7 to the South ea&s;t from that of <HI>Guernzey.</HI> The figure of it will hold proportion with that long kind of &s;quare, which the <HI>Geometricians</HI> call <HI>Oblongum;</HI> the length of it from We&s;t to Ea&s;t 11 miles, the breadth 6 and upwards, the whole circuit about 33. The aire very healthy and little di&s;po&s;ed unto di&s;ea&s;es, unle&s;&s;e it be unto a kinde of Ague in the end of Harve&s;t, which they call <HI>Les Settembers.</HI> The &s;oil &s;ufficiently fertile in it &s;elf, but mo&s;t curiou&s;ly manured, and of a plen|tifull

<P>Both I&s;lands con&s;i&s;t very much of &s;mall Inclo&s;ure, every man in each of them, having &s;omewhat to live on of his own. Only the difference is, that here the mounds are made with ditches &amp; banks of earth ca&s;t up, well fenced and planted with &s;everal &s;orts of apples, out of which they make a plea&s;ing kinde of Sider, which is their ordinary drink; whereas in <HI>Guernzey</HI> they are for the mo&s;t part made of &s;tones, about the height and fa&s;hion of a <HI>Parapet.</HI> A matter of no &s;mall advantage in both places again&s;t the fury of an enemy, who in his marches cannot but be much annoyed with the&s;e incombrances, and &s;hall be forced to pay deer|ly for every foot of ground which there he purcha|&s;eth.</P>
<P>For other &s;trengths this I&s;land is in part beholding unto Nature, and &s;omewhat al&s;o unto Art.

It is for the mo&s;t part the inhabitatiou of the Go|vernour, who is Captain of it; &s;tored with about &s;ome forty pieces of Ordinance, and guarded by &s;ome five and twenty wardours. A place of good &s;ervice for the &s;afety of the I&s;land; if perhaps it may not be commanded, or an|noied by an hill adjoyning, which doth equall, if not over|top it.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, as before we noted, is &s;ome 33 miles in compa&s;&s;e, comprehending in it&punc; 12.

Add to this, that the people here are more poor, and therefore more de&s;titute of humanity; the children here continually craving almes of every &s;tranger; whereas in all <HI>Guernzey</HI> I did not &s;ee one begger.</P>
<P>A principall rea&s;on of which poverty, I &s;uppo&s;e to be their exceeding populou&s;ne&s;&s;e, there being reckoned in &s;o &s;mall a quantity of ground, neer upon thirty thou&s;and li|ving &s;ouls. A matter which gave us no &s;mall cau&s;e of admi|ration; and when my Lord of <HI>Danby</HI> &s;eemed to wonder, how &s;uch a &s;pan of earth could contain &s;uch multitudes of people, I remember that Sir <HI>John Payton</HI> the Lieutenant Go|vernour, made him this an&s;wer, <HI>viz.</HI> That the people mar|ried within them&s;elves like Conies in a burrow; and fur|ther, that for more then thirty years they never had been mole&s;ted either with Sword, Pe&s;tilence, or Fa|mine.</P>
<P>A &s;econd rea&s;on of their poverty (add al&s;o of their num|bers) may be the little liking they have to Trafick; whereby as they might have advantage to improve them&s;elves, and employ their poor; &s;o al&s;o might that &s;ervice ca&s;ual|ly dimini&s;h their huge multitudes, by the lo&s;&s;e of &s;ome men, and diverting others from the thought of mar|riage.</P>
<P>But the main cau&s;e, as I conceive it, is the tenure of their Lands, which are equally to be divided among&s;t all the Sons of every Father, and tho&s;e parcels al&s;o to be &s;ubdivided even <HI>ad infinitnm.</HI> Hence is it, that in all the Countries you &s;hall hardly finde a field of Corne of larger compa&s;&s;e then an or|dinary Garden; every one now having a little to him&s;elf, and that little made le&s;&s;e to his po&s;terity. This Tenure our Lawyers call by the name of <HI>Gavel-kinde;</HI> that is, as &s;ome of them expound it, <HI>Give all-kinne,</HI> becau&s;e it is among&s;t them all to be divided. For thus the Law &s;peaking of the cu&s;tomes of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the 16 Chap. <HI>De praerogatlva Regis. Ibidem omnes haetedes ma&s;culi participabant haereditatem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orum, &amp; &s;imiliter &s;oeminae; &s;ed &s;oemine non participabunt cum viri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> A tenure which on
<PB N="304" REF="177">
the one &s;ide hath many priviledges, and on the other &s;ide as many inconveniences.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, they which hold in this Tenure, are free from all cu&s;tomary &s;ervices, exempt from ward&s;hip, at full age when they come to 15 years, and if they plea&s;e, they may alienate their e&s;tates either by gift or &s;ale, without the a&s;&s;ent or knowledge of the Lord. But which is mo&s;t of all, in ca&s;e the Father be attaint of Felony or Murder, there is no <HI>E&s;cheat</HI> of it to the Lord; the whole E&s;tate, after the King hath had <HI>Diem annum &amp; va&s;tum,</HI> de&s;cending on the Heires. <HI>Et post annum &amp; diem terrae &amp; tenementa reddentur, &amp; revertentur porximo haeredi cui debuerant de&s;cendi&s;&s;e, &s;i felonia facta non fui&s;&s;et;</HI> &s;o the Lawyers.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, by this means their e&s;tates are infinite|ly di&s;tracted, their hou&s;es impoveri&s;hed, the Kings profits in his Sub&s;idies dimini&s;hed, and no little di&s;advantage to the publick &s;ervice, in the finding of Armours for the Wars. Whereupon, as many Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> have altered by e&s;peciall Acts of Parliament, the antient Tenure of their Lands, and reduced it unto <HI>Knights-&s;ervice;</HI> &s;o is it wi&s;hed by the better &s;ort of this people, and intended by &s;ome of them, that their Tenure may be al&s;o altered and brought into the &s;ame condition. A matter of no little profit and advantage to the King, and therefore without difficulty to be compa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this Tenure are their e&s;tates all holden in every of the I&s;lands, except 6 only which are held in Capite; whereof 4 in <HI>Jar&s;ey,</HI> and 2 in <HI>Guetnzey,</HI> and tho&s;e called by the names of <HI>Signeuries.</HI> The <HI>Signeuries</HI> in <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> are fir&s;t, that of St <HI>Oen,</HI> anciently belonging to the <HI>Carter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ts;</HI> and that of <HI>Ro&s;&s;ell,</HI> bought lately of Mr. <HI>Daminick Perin,</HI> by Sir <HI>Philip de Carteret</HI> now living. 3.

<P>The chief Magi&s;trates in both the&s;e I&s;les, for as much as concernes the defence and &s;afety of them, are the Gover|nours; who&s;e office is not much unlike that of the Lord Lieutenants of our &s;hires in <HI>England,</HI> according as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by King <HI>Alfred,</HI> revived by <HI>Henry</HI> III. and &s;o continueth at this day.

<PB N="321" REF="185">
not as particularly appertaining to tho&s;e Pari&s;hes again&s;t which they are di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding of this <HI>Diagram,</HI> there are <NOTE PLACE="marg">(10) What is meant by De&s;erts,</NOTE> three words which need a commentary, as being meerly Aliens to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue, and hardly <HI>Denizens</HI> in <HI>French.</HI> Of the&s;e, that in the <HI>Diagrams</HI> called the <HI>De&s;erts,</HI> is the fir&s;t. A word which properly &s;ignifieth a Wilderne&s;&s;e, or any wa&s;t ground from which ari&s;eth little profit. As it is taken at this pre&s;ent and on this occa&s;ion, it &s;ignifieth a field which formerly was laid to wa&s;te, and is now made arable. The ca&s;e this: At the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Priors Aliens</HI> and the com|po&s;ition made betwixt the Curates and the Governours, there was in either I&s;land much ground of &s;mall advantage to the Church or to the owner, which they called <HI>Les De|&s;erts.</HI> But the Countreys after growing populous, and ma|ny mouths requiring much provi&s;ion, the&s;e De&s;erts were broke up and turned into tillage. Hereupon the Curates made challenge to the tithes, as not at all either intended or contained in the former compo&s;ition. The Governours on the other &s;ide alleadging cu&s;tome, that tho&s;e grounds had never paid the Tithe, and therefore &s;hould not. Nor could the <HI>Clergy</HI> there obtain their rights untill the happy entrance of King <HI>James</HI> upon the&s;e Kingdoms. A Prince of all o|thers a mo&s;t indulgent father to the Church. By him and by a letter Decretory from the Coun&s;ell, it was adjudged in favour of the Mini&s;tery; the Letter bearing date at <HI>Green|wich June</HI> the la&s;t, <HI>anno</HI> 1608. &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>T. Elle&s;mere Canc. R. Salisbury, H. Northampton, E. Worce&s;ter, T. Suffolke, Exeter Zeuch, Wotton, Ce&s;ar, Herbert.</HI> A matter certainly of much importance in the con&s;equence, as making known unto your Lord&s;hip how ea&s;ie a thing it is in the authority royall to free the Church from that tyranny of <HI>cu&s;tome</HI> and <HI>pre&s;cripti|on</HI> under which it groneth.</P>
<P>The next of the&s;e three words to be explained, is in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">French Quer+rui,</NOTE> note <HI>French Querrui,</HI> which in the note is told us to be the 8 and 9 &s;heaf; by which account or way of tithing, the Mini&s;ter in 50 &s;heafs receiveth 6, which is one &s;heaf more then the ordinary tithe. The word corrupted, as I <NOTE PLACE="marg">and by</NOTE>
<PB N="322" REF="186">
conceive, from the <HI>French</HI> word <HI>Charrue,</HI> which &s;ignifieth a Plough, and then <HI>French querrui</HI> is as much as Plough|right, alluding to the cu&s;tome of &s;ome Lords in <HI>France,</HI> who u&s;ed to give their husbandmen or villains, as a guerdon for their toyle, the 8 and 9 of their in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>As for the la&s;t, that, <HI>viz.</HI> which the <HI>Diagram</HI> calleth <HI>Cham|part,</HI> it intimates in the origination of the word, a part or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Champart.</NOTE> portion of the field, that which the Lord in chief re&s;erved unto him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In <HI>Guernzey</HI> it is con&s;tantly the 12 &s;heaf of the whole crop, the Farmer in the counting of his &s;heafes ca&s;ting a&s;ide the 10 for the King, and the 12 which is the Champart, for the Lord.</P>
<P>Now here in <HI>Guernzey</HI> (for tho&s;e of the other I&s;le have no &s;uch cu&s;tome) there is a double <HI>Champart,</HI> that namely <HI>Du Roy,</HI> belonging to the King, whereof the Clergy have the tithe, and that of St. <HI>Michael en leval,</HI> not titheable. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Priorie of St. <HI>Mi|chael,</HI> which was the only <HI>Religious hou&s;e</HI> in the&s;e I&s;lands, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted of it &s;elf; the Tenants made no tendry of this <HI>Champart,</HI> and &s;o it lay among&s;t <HI>concealments.</HI> At the la&s;t, Sir <HI>Thomas Leighton</HI> the Governour here recovered it unto the Crown by cour&s;e of Law, and at his own charges; whereupon the Queen licenced him to make &s;ale of it, to his be&s;t advantage, which accordingly he did.</P>
<P>For the Religion in the&s;e I&s;lands, it hath been ge|nerally &s;uch as that profe&s;&s;ed with us in <HI>England,</HI> and as <NOTE PLACE="marg">(11) The alte|ration of Reli|gion in the&s;e I&s;lands.</NOTE> much varied. When the <HI>Priors Aliens</HI> were bani&s;hed <HI>England</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI> V. they al&s;o were exiled from hence. Upon the demolition of our Abbeys; the Priory of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and that little Oratory of our <HI>Lady of Lehu,</HI> became a ruine. The <HI>Ma&s;&s;e</HI> was here al&s;o trodden down while&s;t King <HI>Edward</HI> &s;tood, and rai&s;ed again at the exaltation of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> Nay even that fiery tryall, which &s;o many of Gods &s;ervants under|went in the &s;hort Reign of that mi&s;guided Lady, ex|tended

even unto the&s;e poor I&s;landers; and that, as I conceive, in a more fearfull tragedy, then any, all that time pre&s;ented on the Stage of <HI>England.</HI> The &s;tory in the brief is this;</P>
<P><HI>Katharine Gowches</HI> a poor widow of St. <HI>Peters-parte</HI> in <NOTE PLACE="marg">(12) Per&s;ect tion here in the dayes of <HI>Q. Mary.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Guernzey,</HI> was noted to be much ab&s;ent from the Church, and her two daughters guilty of the &s;ame neglect. Upon this they were pre&s;ented before <HI>Jaques Amy</HI> then Dean of the I&s;land, who finding in them, that they held opi|nions contrary unto tho&s;e then allowed, about the Sa|crament of the Altar, pronounced them <HI>Hereticks</HI> and condemned them to the fire. The poor women on the other &s;ide pleaded for them&s;elves, that that Doctrine had been taught them in the time of King <HI>Edward;</HI> but if the Queen was otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed, they were con|tent to be of her Religion. This was fair, but this would not &s;erve; for by the Dean they were delivered unto <HI>Elier Go&s;&s;elin</HI> the then Bailiffe, and by him unto the fire, <HI>July 18. Anno Dom.</HI> 1556. One of the&s;e daugh|ters, <HI>Perotine Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> &s;he was called, was at that time great with childe; her husband, which was a Mini&s;ter, being, in tho&s;e dangerous times, fled the I&s;land; in the middle of the flames and angui&s;h of her torments, her belly brake in &s;under, and her child, a goodly boy, fell down into the fire, but was pre&s;ently &s;natched up by one <HI>W. Hou&s;e</HI> one of the by-&s;tanders. Upon the noi&s;e of this &s;trange accident, the cruell Bailiffe retur|ned command, that the poor Infant mu&s;t be ca&s;t again into the flames; which was accordingly performed; and &s;o that pretty babe was borne a Martyr, and added to the number of the <HI>Holy Innocents.</HI> A cruelty not paral|leld in any &s;tory, not heard of among&s;t the Nati|ons. But &s;uch was the plea&s;ure of the Magi&s;tate, as one in the Ma&s;&s;acre of the younger <HI>Maximinus,</HI> viz. <HI>Canis pe&s;&s;imi ne catulum e&s;&s;e relinquendum;</HI> that not any i&s;&s;ue &s;hould be left alive of an Heretick Pa|rent.</P>

<P>This fit of indignation being thus pa&s;&s;ed over, I can proceed with greater patience to the re&s;t of the &s;tory of this I&s;land, which in brief is this:</P>
<P>That after the death of Queen <HI>Many,</HI> Religion was <NOTE PLACE="marg">(3) The I&s;lands an|nexed for e|ver unto the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Wint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> and for what Rea&s;ons.</NOTE> again re&s;tored in the reformation of it to the&s;e I&s;lands. In which &s;tate it hath ever &s;ince continued in the main and &s;ub&s;tance of it; but not without &s;ome alteration in the circum&s;tance and forme of Government. For where|as notwith&s;tanding the alteration of Religion in the&s;e I&s;lands they &s;till continued under the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Con|&s;tance,</HI> during the whole Empire of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. and <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. yet it &s;eemed good to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> upon &s;ome rea&s;ons of State, to annex them unto that of <HI>Winton.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t motive of it was, becau&s;e that Bi&s;hop re|fu&s;ed to abjure the pretended power which the Pope chal|lengeth in Kingdomes, as other of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prelates did; but this di&s;plea&s;ure held not long.

&s;o there might a fairer way be opened to the <HI>reformation</HI> of Religion; to which that Bi&s;hop was an enemy, and that the &s;ecrets of the State might not be carryed over into <HI>France,</HI> by rea&s;on of that entercour&s;e which needs mu&s;t be between a Bi&s;hop and his Mini&s;ters.

<P>THus having &s;hewed unto your Lord&s;hip the affairs <NOTE PLACE="marg">(1) The con|dition of <HI>Gene|va</HI> under their Bi&s;hop.</NOTE> and condition of the&s;e Churches till the Refor|mation of Religion; I come next in the cour&s;e of my de&s;igne, unto that Innovation made among&s;t them in the point of Di&s;cipline. For the more happy di&s;patch of which bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, I mu&s;t crave leave to a&s;cend a little higher into the &s;tory of change, then the introduction of it into tho&s;e little I&s;lands. So doing, I &s;hall give your Lord&s;hip better &s;atisfaction, then if I &s;hould immediately de&s;cend upon that Argument; the rather becau&s;e I &s;hall de|liver nothing in this di&s;cour&s;e not warranted to be by the
<PB N="328" REF="189">
chief contrivers of the Di&s;cipline. To begin then with the fir&s;t originall and commencement of it; &s;o it is that it took the fir&s;t beginning at a City of the <HI>Allobroges</HI> or <HI>Savoyards,</HI> called <HI>Geneva,</HI> and by that name mentioned in the fir&s;t of <HI>Ce&s;ars</HI> Commentaries. A Town &s;ituate at the end of <HI>Lacus Lemannus,</HI> and divided by <HI>Rhodanus</HI> or <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> into two parts. Belonging formerly in the Soveraignty of it to the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> but in the profits and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to their Bi&s;hop and homager of that Dukedome. To this Bi&s;hop then there appertained not only an Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall juri&s;diction, as Governour of the Church under the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in <HI>Daulphinoys</HI> his Metropolitane; but a juri&s;diction al&s;o temporall, as Lord and Ma&s;ter of the Town under the protection of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> This granted by the te&s;timony of <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Epi&s;tle unto Cardinall <HI>Sadolet,</HI> dated the la&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t 1539. Habebat &s;ane</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>jus gladii, &amp; alias civilis juri&s;dictionis partes;</HI> but as he conceived, I know not on what grounds, <HI>Magi&s;tratui ereptas,</HI> fraudulently taken from the Civill Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>In this condition it continued till the year 1528. when <NOTE PLACE="marg">(2) The altera|tion there both in Religion,</NOTE> tho&s;e of <HI>Berne,</HI> after a publick di&s;putation held, had made an alteration in Religion. At that time <HI>Viret</HI> and <HI>Farel|lus,</HI> men &s;tudious of the Reformation had gotten footing in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and diligently there &s;ollicited the cau&s;e and entertainment of it. But this propo&s;all not plau&s;ibly ac|cepted by the Bi&s;hop, they dealt with tho&s;e of the lower rank, among&s;t whom they had gotten mo&s;t credit, and ta|king opportunity by the actions and example of tho&s;e of <HI>Berne,</HI> they compelled the Bi&s;hop and his Clergy to abandon the Town, and after proceeded to the reforming of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">and</NOTE> Church. This al&s;o avowed by <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the &s;aid Cardinall, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Church had been reformed and &s;etled before his coming into tho&s;e quarters by <HI>Viret</HI> and <HI>Farellus,</HI> and that he only had approved of their procee|dings, <HI>Sed quia quae a</HI> Vireto <HI>&amp;</HI> Farello <HI>facta e&s;&s;ent, &s;uffragio meo comprobavi,</HI> &amp;c. as he there hath it.</P>
<P>Nor did they only in that tumult alter the Doctrine and <NOTE PLACE="marg">(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">) in Polity.</NOTE> orders of the Church, but changed al&s;o the Government of the Town, di&s;claiming all alleagiance either to their Bi&s;hop or
<PB N="329" REF="189">
their Duke, and &s;tanding on their own liberty as a free City. And for this al&s;o they are indebted to the active coun&s;els of <HI>Fare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">us.</HI> For thus <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Zurich,</HI> dated the 26 of <HI>November 1553.

<P>The power and dominion of that City thus put into the <NOTE PLACE="marg">(4) The e&s;tate of that Church before the coming of <HI>Calvin</HI> thither.</NOTE> hands of the common people, and all things left at liberty and randome, it could not be expected that there &s;hould any di&s;cipline [be] ob&s;erved, or good order in the Church. The Common-councell of the Town di&s;po&s;ed of it as they plea&s;ed; and if any crime which antiently belonged to Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall juri&s;diction, did h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">p to be committed, it was puni&s;hed by order from that Councell. No cen&s;ures Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall, no &s;entence of Excommunication thought on at that time, either here at <HI>Geneva,</HI> or in any other of the popular Churches. <HI>Si quidem excommunicationi in aliis Eccle|&s;iis nullus locus,</HI> as <HI>Beza</HI> hath it in the life of <HI>Calvin.</HI> And the &s;ame <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Zurich</HI> affirmes no le&s;&s;e in the&s;e words, <HI>viz. Nec me latet pies &amp; doctos e&s;&s;e homines, quibus &s;ub principibus Chri&s;tianis non videtur e&s;&s;e nece&s;&s;aria Excom|municatio;</HI> &s;o he.</P>
<P>Thus was it with the Church and City of <HI>Geneva</HI> at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">(5) The con|ception.</NOTE> fir&s;t coming of <HI>Calvin</HI> to them; a man of excellent abilities, and one that had attained a good repute in many places of the <HI>French</HI> dominions. Not finding that a&s;&s;urance in the Realm of <HI>France,</HI> he re&s;olved to place him&s;elfe at <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> or at <HI>Strasbure.</HI> But taking <HI>Geneva</HI> in his way, upon the im|portunity of <HI>Farellus,</HI> he conde&s;cended to make that place the &s;cene of his endeavours, and his a&s;&s;ent once known, he was admitted &s;traight to be one of their ordinary preachers and their Divinity reader. <HI>Men&s;. Aug. anno</HI> 1536. This done he pre&s;ently negotiates with the people, publickly to abjure the Papacy: nor &s;o only, but (as <HI>Beza</HI> hath it in his life) <HI>Quod doctrinam &amp; di&s;ciplinam capitibus aliquot comprehen|&s;am admitterent;</HI> that they al&s;o &s;hould give way to &s;uch a di&s;cipline, which he and his a&s;&s;ociates had agreed on. A
<PB N="330" REF="190">
matter at the la&s;t effected, but not without much difficulty, and on the 20 of <HI>July, anno</HI> 1537. the whole City bound them&s;elves by oath accordingly; which di&s;cipline of what quality it was I cannot learn: &s;ure I am, it had no affinity with that in u&s;e among&s;t the antients. For thus him&s;elf in his Epi&s;tle above mentioned unto <HI>Sadolet, Di&s;ciplinam qualem vetus habuit Eccle&s;ia apud nos non e&s;&s;e [dicis]; ne&abque; nos diffi|temur.</HI></P>
<P>The Di&s;cipline hitherto was only in conception, before it came unto maturity, and ready for the birth, the people weary of this new yoak began to murmur, and he re&s;olute|ly bent not to vary from his fir&s;t purpo&s;e, was in that di&s;|contentment bani&s;hed the Town, together with <HI>Farellus</HI> and <HI>Coraldus</HI> his colleagues, <HI>anno</HI> 1538. Three years, or there|abouts <NOTE PLACE="marg">(6) The Birth</NOTE> he continued in this exile, being bountifully enter|tained at <HI>Strasburg;</HI> from whence with unre&s;i&s;tible impor|tunity he was again recalled by that uncon&s;tant multitude. A de&s;ire to which by no means he would hearken, unle&s;&s;e both they and all their Mini&s;ters would take a &s;olemn oath to admit a compleat forme of di&s;cipline, not arbitrary, not changeable; but to remain in force for ever after. Upon a&s;&s;urance of their conformity herein, he returns unto them <NOTE PLACE="marg">and</NOTE> like an other <HI>Tully</HI> unto <HI>Rome;</HI> and certainly we may &s;ay of him as the Hi&s;torian of the other, <HI>Nec qui&s;quam aut expul&s;us e&s;t invid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, aut receptus letius.</HI> On the 13 of <HI>September,</HI> 1541. he is admitted into the Town; and now (there being &s;trength enough to deliver) the Di&s;cipline &s;uch as he had contrived it, was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the 20 of <HI>November</HI> fol|lowing.</P>
<P>This new Di&s;cipline thus borne into the world, was yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">(7) Growth of the new Di&s;ci|pline.</NOTE> cru&s;h'd almo&s;t in the growth of it, by the faction of <HI>Perinus</HI> at that time Captain of the people, and of great power among the many. Twelve years together, but yet with many luoid intervals, did it &s;truggle with that op|po&s;ition, and at the la&s;t was in a manner ruined and op|pre&s;&s;ed by it. For whereas the Con&s;i&s;tory had given &s;en|tence again&s;t one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> even in the highe&s;t cen&s;ure of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> the Common-councell not only ab&s;olved him from that cen&s;ure, but fooli&s;hly decreed, That <HI>Excom|munication</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="190">
and <HI>Ab&s;olution</HI> did properly belong to them. Upon this he is again re&s;olved to quit the Town; but at la&s;t the Controver&s;ie is by joynt con&s;ent referred unto the judgement of four Cities of the <HI>Switzers.</HI> Then did he labour in particular to con&s;ider of it, not as a matter of ordinary con&s;equence, but (as in his &s;aid Epi&s;tle to tho&s;e in <HI>Zurich) De toto Eccle&s;iae hujus &s;tatu,</HI> &amp;c. &s;uch as on which the whole being of that Church depended. In the end he &s;o contrived it, that the an&s;wer was returned to <HI>Geneva, Nil contra tentandum;</HI> that they &s;hould not &s;eek to alter what was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed; and hereupon they were all conten|ted to obey. By which means this Infant di&s;cipline, with &s;uch variety of troubles born and nur&s;ed, attained unto a fair and manly growth, and in &s;hort &s;pace &s;o well improved, that it dur&s;t bid defiance unto Kings and Princes.</P>
<P>The chief means by which this new Platforme was ad|mitted <NOTE PLACE="marg">(8) The qua|lity of Lay-Elders.</NOTE> in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and afterwards de&s;ired in other places, was principally that parity and equallty, which it &s;eemed to carry, the people being as it were a double part in it, and &s;o advanced into the highe&s;t Magi&s;tracy. For &s;o the cunning Architect had contrived it, that for every pillar of the Church, there &s;hould be al&s;o two Pilla&s;ters, or rather underproppers of the people. <HI>Non &s;olos verbi Mini&s;tros &s;edere judices in con&s;i&s;torio; &s;ed numerum duplo majorem, partim ex mi|nori &s;enatu, partim ex majori delige;</HI> &s;o he in his Remon&s;trance unto them of <HI>Zurich,</HI> affixed to his Epi&s;tle. The&s;e men they honour with the name of <HI>Elders,</HI> and to them the charge is &s;pecially committed of inquiring into the lives of tho&s;e within their divi&s;ion, <HI>viz. Sitne domus pacata &amp; recte compo&s;ita,</HI> &amp;c. as the Epi&s;tle to <HI>Ga&s;p. Olevianus</HI> doth in&s;truct us. By which device there is not only a kind of &s;atisfaction given to the multitude, but a great deal of envie is declined by the Mini&s;tery; which that curious and un|neighbourly inqui&s;ition would otherwi&s;e derive upon them. And certainly, were there in the&s;e <HI>Elders,</HI> as they call them, a power only of information, the device might be &s;o much the more allowable. But that &s;uch &s;imple

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;&s;e thus happily &s;ucceeding at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and his name continually growing into higher credit; his <NOTE PLACE="marg">(9) The diffe|rent proceed|ing of <HI>Calvin.</HI></NOTE> next endevour was to plant that government in all places which with &s;uch trouble had been fitted unto one. Certainly we do as much affect the i&s;&s;ue of our braines as of our bodies, and labour with no le&s;&s;e vehemency to advance them. And &s;o it was with him in this parti|cular, his after-writings tending mainly to this end, that his new Platforme might have found an univer&s;all entertainment. But this mode&s;tly enough, and chiefly by way of commendation. Two examples only &s;hall be &s;ufficient, becau&s;e I will not be too great a trouble to your Lord&s;hip in the collection of a tedious Catalogue. <HI>Ga&s;per Olevianus</HI> a Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>Tryers,</HI> by his Letters bearing date the 12 of <HI>Aprill, anno</HI> 1560. giveth notice unto <HI>Calvin</HI> of the State of their affaires; and with|all that he found the people willing to conde&s;cend unto a Di&s;cipline. <HI>Calvin</HI> in his an&s;wer pre&s;ents him with a &s;ummary of that platforme, rai&s;ed lately at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and then clo&s;eth with him thus, <HI>Compendium hoc &s;atis putavi fore ex quo formam aliquam conciperes, quam prae&s;cribere non debut.

In this he doth &s;uffi|ciently expre&s;&s;e his de&s;ire to have his project entertained; in that which followeth he doth &s;ignifie his joy that the world had made it welcome. An epi&s;tle written to a certain <HI>Quidam</HI> of <HI>Polonia,</HI> dated the year 1561. Wherein he doth congratulate the admi&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pell (as he cals it) in that Kingdom.

This it was, that made him with &s;uch violence cry down the <HI>Hierarchie</HI> of the Church, the plague of Bi&s;hops, as he cals it. <HI>Hanc pe&s;tem caveant qui Eccli&s;iam &s;alvam cupiunt,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Et ne illam quae&s;o unquam admittas</HI> (he &s;peaketh it unto <HI>Cnoxe) quan|tumvis unitatis retinendae &s;pecie,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>blandiatur.</HI> This was it which made him reckon it as a note e&s;&s;entiall of the Church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">V. cap. 5. <HI>n&punc;</HI></NOTE> without which it was not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; a point &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Ut ab ea recedere non magis quam ab reli|gionis ip&s;ius placitis, liceat.

<P>And certainly it was a matter of no &s;mall grief and <NOTE PLACE="marg">(11) Both of the&s;e enemies to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> di&s;content unto them both, that when &s;o many Churches had applauded their invention, the Church of <HI>England</HI> only &s;hould be found untractable.

The appointing and proclaiming all publick fa&s;ts: Chap. 11. 1. The pre&s;i|dency in their A&s;&s;emblies: Chap. 16. 1. The calling of their Councels: Chap. 19. 20.

The childe being brought, and that holy action &s;o far for|wards, that they were come to the naming of the childe, they named it <HI>Richard:</HI> which was the name of the Infants Grand|father by the Mothers &s;ide. Upon this a &s;top was made, nor would he be per&s;waded to baptize the childe; unle&s;&s;e the name of it were altered: which when the Godfather refu&s;ed to do, he for&s;ook the place, and the childe was carried back unchri&s;tned. To this purpo&s;e, but not in the &s;ame words, the whole hi&s;tory.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN this &s;tate and under this Government continued tho&s;e I&s;lands till the happy entrance of King <HI>James</HI> upon the Monarchy of <HI>England.</HI> A Prince of whom the brethren conceived no &s;mall hopes, as one that had continually been brought up by and among&s;t tho&s;e of that faction: and had &s;o oft confirmed their much de&s;ired <HI>Presbyteries.</HI> But when once he had &s;et foot in <HI>England,</HI> where he was &s;ure to meet with quiet men, and more obedience: he quickly made them &s;ee, that of his favour to that party, they had made them&s;elves too large a promi&s;e. For in the conference at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> he publickly profe&s;&s;ed, that how&s;oever he lived among <HI>Puritans,</HI> and was kept for the mo&s;t part as a ward under them; yet ever &s;ince he was of the age of ten
<PB N="379" REF="214">
years old, he ever di&s;liked their opinions: and as the <HI>Sa|viour of the world</HI> had &s;aid, <HI>though he lived among them, he was not of them.</HI> In this conference al&s;o, that &s;o memorized <HI>A|pophthegm</HI> of his Maje&s;ty: <HI>No Bi&s;hop,</HI> no King: and anon af|ter, My Lords the Bi&s;hops (faith he) <HI>I may thank ye, that the&s;e men</HI> (the <HI>Puritans) plead thus for my Supremacy.</HI> Add to this, that his Maje&s;ty had alwaies fo&s;tred in him&s;elf a pious purpo&s;e, not only of reducing all his Realms and Domini|ons into one uniform order and cour&s;e of di&s;cipline; which thing him&s;elf avoweth, in his Letters Patents unto tho&s;e of <HI>Jarzey:</HI> but al&s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h in all the reformed Churches, if po&s;&s;ibly it might be done; together with unity of Reli|gion, and uniformity of devotion. For which cau&s;e he had commanded the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgie</HI> to be tran&s;lated into the <HI>La|tine,</HI> and al&s;o into mo&s;t of the national Languages round about us: by that and other more private means, to bring them into a love and good opinion of our Government: which he oftentimes acknowledged to <HI>have been approved by manifold ble&s;&s;ings from God him&s;elf.</HI> A heroick purpo&s;e, and worthy of the Prince from whom it came.</P>
<P>This notwith&s;tanding, that he was enclined the other way; yet upon &s;uit made by tho&s;e of the&s;e I&s;lands, he con|firmed unto them their pre&s;ent orders, by a Letter under his private Seal, dated the 8. of <HI>August</HI> in the fir&s;t year of his reign in <HI>England;</HI> which Letters were communicated in the Synod at St. <HI>Hilaries</HI> the 18. of <HI>September,</HI> 1605. the Letter written in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue; but the tenor of them was as followeth:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The rea&s;ons which moved this Prince to a&s;&s;ent unto a form of Government, which he liked not; was partly an ancient rule and precept of his own, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Princes at their fir&s;t entrance to a Grown ought not to innovate the government pre&s;ently e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> But the principal cau&s;e indeed, was de&s;ire not to di&s;courage the <HI>Scots</HI> in their beginnings: or to lay open too much of his intents at once unto them. For &s;ince the year 1595. his Maje&s;ty wearied with the confu&s;ions of the <HI>Di&s;ci|pline</HI> in that Church e&s;tabli&s;hed; had much bu&s;ied him&s;elf in re&s;toring their antient place and power unto the Bi&s;hops. He had already brought that work &s;o forwards, that the <HI>Scotti&s;h Mini&s;ters</HI> had admitted of 13 Commi&s;&s;ioners (which was the antient number of the Bi&s;hops) to have &s;uffrage in the <HI>Parliament;</HI> and to repre&s;ent in that A&s;&s;embly the body of the Clergy: and that their place &s;hould be perpetual. Thus far with &s;ome trouble, but much art, he had prevailed on that unquiet and unruly company: and therefore had he denied the I&s;landers an allowance of their <HI>Di&s;cipline;</HI> he had only taught the <HI>Scotti&s;h Mini&s;tery</HI> what to tru&s;t to. An al|lowance whereof he after made e&s;pecial u&s;e in his pro|ceedings with that people. For thus his Maje&s;ty in a Decla|ration concerning &s;uch of the <HI>Scotti&s;h Mini&s;ters,</HI> as lay at|tainted of High Trea&s;on, <HI>Anno 1606. viz.</HI> <Q>And as we have ever regarded carefully how convenient it is to maintain every Countrey in that form of Government which is fitte&s;t and can be&s;t agree with the con&s;titution thereof;
<PB N="381" REF="215">
and how dangerous alterations are without good advice and mature deliberation; and that even in matters of or|der of the Church, in &s;ome &s;mall I&s;land under our Do|minions, we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ab&s;tained from &s;uffering any alterati|on; So we doubt not, &amp;c as it there followeth in the words of the Declaration.</Q></P>
<P>On the&s;e rea&s;ons, or on &s;ome other not within the power of my conjecture; this Di&s;cipline was permitted in the&s;e I&s;lands: though long it did not continue with them. For pre&s;ently upon his Maje&s;ties comming to the Crown, Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> then Governor of <HI>Jarzey</HI> was attaint of Trea&s;on: on which attaindure this with others of his places, fell actually into the Kings di&s;po&s;ing: upon this variancy, it plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to depute the pre&s;ent Go|vernor Sir <HI>John Peiton,</HI> to that office: A Gentleman not over forward in him&s;elf, to pur&s;ue the projects of the <HI>Pow|lets</HI> his predece&s;&s;ors, (for Sir <HI>W. Raleigh</HI> had but a little while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the place) and it may well be furni&s;hed al&s;o with &s;ome &s;ecret in&s;tructions from the King, not to be too indulgent to that party. Whether that &s;o it was or not, I cannot &s;ay: Sure I am that he omitted no opportunity of abating in the <HI>Con&s;i&s;torians</HI> the pride and &s;tomach of their ju|ri&s;diction. But long it was not before he found a fit occa|&s;ion to place his battery again&s;t tho&s;e works; which in the I&s;land there they thought impregnable. For as in the an|cient proverb, <HI>Facile e&s;t invenire baculum ut caedas canem:</HI> it is an ea&s;ie thing to quarrell one, whom before hand we are re|&s;olved to baffle. The occa&s;ion this. The Curate of S. <HI>Johns</HI> being lately dead, it plea&s;ed the <HI>Colloquie</HI> of that I&s;land, ac|cording to their former method; to appoint one <HI>Brevin</HI> to &s;ucceed him: again&s;t which cour&s;e, the Governor, the Kings Attorney and other the officers of the Crown pro|te&s;ted; as prejudicial to the rights and profits of the King. Howbeit, the ca&s;e was over-ruled; and the <HI>Colloquie</HI> for that time carried it: hereupon a bill of Articles was exhi|bited unto the Councel again&s;t the Mini&s;ters, by <HI>Peiton</HI> the Governor, <HI>Marret</HI> the Attorney, <HI>now one</HI> of the Jurates, and the re&s;t: as <HI>viz.</HI> that they had u&s;urped the <HI>Patronage</HI> of all benefices in the I&s;land; that thereby they admitted men to
<PB N="382" REF="216">
livings without any form of pretentation; that thereby they deprived his Maje&s;ty of Vacancies and fir&s;t-fruits; that by connivence (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it) of the for|mer Governors, they exerci&s;ed a kinde of arbitrary juri&s;|diction, making and di&s;annulling lawes at their own uncer|tain liberty; whereupon they mo&s;t humbly be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to grant them &s;uch a di&s;cipline, as might be fitte&s;t to the nature of the place, and le&s;&s;e derogatory to the Royal <HI>Prerogative.</HI></P>
<P>This Bill exhibited unto the Councell, found there &s;uch approbation, that pre&s;ently Sir <HI>Robert Gardiner,</HI> once chief Ju&s;tice, (as I take it) in the <HI>Realm of Ireland;</HI> and <HI>James Hu&s;&s;ey</HI> Doctor of the Lawes; though not without &s;ome for|mer bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; were &s;ent into the I&s;lands. Again&s;t their coming into <HI>Jarzey,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of that I&s;land had prepa|red their An&s;wer; which in the general may be reduced to the&s;e two heads; <HI>viz.</HI> That their appointment of men into the Mini&s;tery, and the exerci&s;e of Juri&s;diction being prin|cipal parts of the Church Di&s;cipline; had been confirmed unto them by his Maje&s;ty. And for the matter of Fir&s;t-fruits, it was a payment which had never been exacted from them; &s;ince their di&s;charge from him at <HI>Con&s;tance;</HI> unto whom in former times they had been due. Upon this an&s;wer the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was again remitted unto the King, and to his Coun|cell; by them to be determined upon the comming of their Deputies: the Committees not having (as they &s;aid) a power to determine it; but only to in&s;truct them&s;elves in the whole cau&s;e, and accordingly to make report. Other matters within the compa&s;&s;e of their Commi&s;&s;ion, and about which they were &s;aid principally to be &s;ent over, were then concluded: all which hapned in the year 1608. Immediate|ly upon the departure of the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners; and long before their Deputies had any faculty to repair unto the Court: a foul deformity of confu&s;ion and di&s;traction had overgrown the Church and <HI>Di&s;cipline.</HI> In former times all &s;uch as took upon them any publick charge either in Church or Common-wealth, had bound them&s;elves by oath to che|ri&s;h and maintain the <HI>Di&s;cipline:</HI> that oath is now di&s;claimed as dangerous and unwarrantable. Before it was their cu|&s;tome
<PB N="383" REF="216">
to exact <HI>&s;ub&s;cription</HI> to their platform, of all &s;uch as purpo&s;ed to receive the <HI>Sacrament:</HI> but now the Kings <HI>Attorney,</HI> and others of that party, cho&s;e rather to ab&s;tain from the Communion; nay even the very <HI>Elders</HI> &s;illy &s;ouls, that thought them&s;elves as <HI>Sacro&s;ancti</HI> as a <HI>Roman Tribune:</HI> were drown with proces into the civil courts; and there reputed with the vulgar. Nor was the ca&s;e much better with the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tory:</HI> the <HI>Jurates</HI> in their <HI>Cohu</HI> or Town-hall, relieving &s;uch by their authority, whom that <HI>Tribunal</HI> had condemned or cen&s;ured. <HI>A pravis ad praecipitia.</HI> Such is the inhumanity of the world, that when once a man is ca&s;t upon his knees, every one-lends a hand to lay him pro&s;trate. No &s;ooner had tho&s;e of the lower rank, ob&s;erved the Mini&s;ters to &s;tagger in their chairs; but they in&s;tantly begin to wran|gle for the Tithes: and if the Curate will exact his due; the Law is open, let them try the Title. Their Benefices, where before accounted as excempt and priviledged, are brought to reckon for <HI>fir&s;t-fruits</HI> and <HI>tenths:</HI> and tho&s;e not rated by the book of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> but by the will and plea&s;ure of the Gover|nor. Adde unto this, that one of the <HI>Con&s;tables</HI> preferred a Bill again&s;t them in the <HI>Cohu:</HI> wherein the Mini&s;ters them|&s;elves were <HI>indicted</HI> of <HI>hypocri&s;ie;</HI> and their government of <HI>ty|ranny.</HI> And which of all the re&s;t was the greate&s;t of their mi&s;eries; it was objected that they held &s;ecret meetings and private practi&s;es again&s;t the Governor: yea &s;uch as reflected al&s;o on the King.</P>
<P>In thi confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;&s;e they were almo&s;t uncapa|ble of coun&s;el. They applyed them&s;elves in the next <HI>Col|loquie</HI> unto the Governor, that he would plea&s;e to intercede for them to his Maje&s;ty: but him they had &s;o far exa&s;pera|ted by their clamours, that he utterly refu&s;ed to meddle for them. Nor did the Mini&s;ters, as I conjecture, propound it farther to him, then by way of due re&s;pect: as little hoping that he &s;hould bend him&s;elf for their relief; whom they &s;o often had accu&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of all this trouble. At la&s;t they are re&s;olved to ca&s;t them&s;elves upon the grace and &s;a|vour of the King; and for that cau&s;e addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves and their de&s;ires unto the Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> a man, at that time of &s;pecial credit with the King, being al&s;o <HI>Lord High
<PB N="384" REF="217">
Trea&s;urer,</HI> and chief Secretary. This their addre&s;&s;e as he took in &s;pecial good regard; &s;o did he al&s;o &s;eem to advi&s;e them for the be&s;t: his coun&s;el, that they &s;hould joyn unto them tho&s;e of <HI>Guernzey,</HI> in the peru&s;ing of their <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> and the correcting of &s;uch things mo&s;t &s;tomacked by the Civil Magi&s;trates: and after, both together to refer them&s;elves unto his Maje&s;ty. A coun&s;el not to be de&s;pi&s;ed in the ap|pearance: but yet (as certainly he was of a fine and &s;ubtil wit) of exceeding cunning. For by this means the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e not yet ripe, and the King &s;carce ma&s;ter of his pur|po&s;es in <HI>Scotland;</HI> he gains time farther to con&s;ider of the main: and by ingaging tho&s;e of <HI>Guernzey</HI> in the cau&s;e, they al&s;o had been &s;ubject to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion: But &s;ubtil as he was, he found no art to protract the fatal and inevita|ble blow of death; for while&s;t his Clients bu&s;ily pur&s;ued this project, in reviewing of their platform, he yeelded up him&s;elf unto the grave, <HI>March 24. anno</HI> 1612. upon report whereof, they layed by the pro&s;ecution of that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; re|ferring of it to the mercy of &s;ome better times.</P>
<P>This comfort yet they found in their addre&s;&s;e unto the Court, that things at home were carried on in a more fair and quiet cour&s;e: but long they would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to enjoy that happine&s;&s;e. The Pari&s;h of S. <HI>Peters</HI> being void, <HI>Me&s;&s;erny</HI> was pre&s;ented to it by the Governour: one that had &s;pent his time in <HI>Oxenford,</HI> and had received the Orders of the Prie&s;thood from the Right Reverend Doctor <HI>Bridges,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of that Dioce&s;&s;e. A matter &s;o infinitely &s;to|macked by the <HI>Colloquie,</HI> that they would by no means yeeld to his admi&s;&s;ion: not &s;o much becau&s;e of his pre&s;entation from the Governor, as of his ordination from the Bi|&s;hop. For now they thought <HI>Annibalem ad portas,</HI> that Popery began again to creep upon them: and therefore they re&s;olved to fight it out, <HI>tanquam de &s;umma rerum,</HI> as if the whole cau&s;e of Religion were in danger. <HI>Me&s;&s;erny</HI> how|&s;oever enjoyed the profits of the living; and a new com|plaint was made again&s;t them to the Councel: In which complaint, there al&s;o was intelligence given unto their Lord&s;hips, that the inhabitants generally of the I&s;le, were di&s;contented with the <HI>Di&s;cipline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and guidance of the

The matter thus grown ready for an i&s;&s;ue, and his Maje&s;ty de&s;irous to bring all things to the mo&s;t peace|able and quiet end; both parties were commanded to at|tend at Court: the Governor and &s;ecular &s;tates, to pro&s;e|cute their &s;uit, and make good their intelligence; the Mini|&s;ters to an&s;wer the complaints, and tender their propo&s;als. Hereupon the Governor and tho&s;e of the laity delegated to the Court, <HI>Marret</HI> the <HI>Attorney,</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;ervy</HI> the new Par|&s;on of St. <HI>Peters:</HI> by whom the people &s;ent a formal Peti|tion to his Maje&s;ty, &s;igned by many of their hands; and to this purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would be plea&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h in their I&s;land, the book of Common-prayers; and to &s;et|tle there among them &s;ome Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Officer, with <HI>Epi&s;co|pal</HI> juri&s;diction. On the other &s;ide, there were deputed, for the Mini&s;ters, Mr. <HI>Bandinell,</HI> the now Dean; <HI>Oliveis,</HI> the now Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dean; <HI>Effart,</HI> the Curate of St. <HI>Saviours;</HI> and <HI>De la place,</HI> then Curate of St. <HI>Maries.</HI> To whom this al&s;o was &s;pecial|ly given in charge, that with all indu&s;try they &s;hould op|po&s;e what&s;oever innovation (as they called it) might be propo&s;ed unto them: and re&s;olutely bear up for the pre&s;ent <HI>Di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately upon their appearance at the Court, both par|ties by his Maje&s;ty were referred to the Councel: and by them again to my Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Lord <HI>Zouche,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Herbert,</HI> then principal Secretary. Be|fore them the cau&s;e was privately argued by the Deputies of both parties: and the de&s;ires of the Governor and of the people, con&s;tantly impugned by the Mini&s;ters. But as it al|waies hapneth that there is no confederacy &s;o well joyned, but one member of it may be &s;evered from the re&s;t; and thereby the whole practi&s;e overthrown: &s;o was it al&s;o in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. For tho&s;e which there &s;ollicited &s;ome pri|vate bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the Governors, had finely wrought upon the weakne&s;&s;e or ambition of <HI>De la place;</HI> bearing him in hand, that if the Government of the Church were altered, and the office of the Dean re&s;tored; he was for certain
<PB N="386" REF="218">
re&s;olved upon to be the man. Being fa&s;hioned into this hope, he &s;peedily betrayed the coun&s;els of his fellowes; and furni&s;h|ed their opponents at all their enterviews, with &s;uch intelli|gence as might make mo&s;t for their advantage. At la&s;t the Mi|ni&s;ters not well agreeing in their own demands, and having little to &s;ay in the defence of their proper cau&s;e, whereto their an&s;wers were not provided beforehand; my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI> at the Councel-table thus declared unto them the plea&s;ure of the King and Councell: <HI>viz.</HI> that for the &s;pee|dy redre&s;&s;e of their di&s;orders, it was reputed mo&s;t conveni|ent to e&s;tabli&s;h among them, the authority and office of the Dean; that the book of Common-prayer being again printed in the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould be received into their Chur|ches; but the Mini&s;ters not tyed to the &s;trict ob&s;er|vance of it in all particulars: that <HI>Me&s;&s;erny</HI> &s;hould be admit|ted to his benefice; and that &s;o they might return unto their charges.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, they were commanded to depart, and to &s;ig|nifie to tho&s;e from whom the came, they full &s;cope of his Maje&s;ties re&s;olution; and &s;o they did. But being &s;ome|what backward in obeying this decree, the Councel inti|mated to them by Sir <HI>Phil. de Carteret</HI> their Agent for the E&s;tates of the I&s;land; that the Mini&s;ters from among them|&s;elves, &s;hould make choice of three learned and grave per|&s;ons, who&s;e names they &s;hould return unto the board: out of which his Maje&s;ty would re&s;olve on one to be their Dean. A propo&s;ition which found among them little en|tertainment. Not &s;o much out of di&s;like unto the digni|ty, for they were mo&s;t of them well contented with the change: but becau&s;e every one of them conceived hopeful|ly of him&s;elf to be the man, and all of them could not be elected; they were not willing to prejudice their own hopes, by the naming of another. In the mean time, Mr. <HI>Da|vid Band<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ell</HI> then Curate of St. <HI>Maries,</HI> either having or pretending &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;&s;e unto <HI>London;</HI> was recommended by the Governor as a man mo&s;t fit to &s;u&s;tain that place and dignity.

as a per&s;on an&s;werable to the Governors commendations; he was e&s;tabli&s;hed in that office by Letters Patents from his Maje&s;ty, dated the 8. of <HI>March, anno</HI> 1619. and was inve&s;ted with all &s;uch rights as formerly had been inherent in that dignity: and that both in point of profit; and al&s;o in point of juri&s;diction. For whereas formerly the Dean was &s;etled in the be&s;t benefice in the I&s;land, that <HI>viz.</HI> of St <HI>Martins;</HI> and had divers portions of tithes out of every of the Pari&s;hes: the &s;aid St. <HI>Martins</HI> was allotted to him, upon the next avoidance; and the whole tithes of St. <HI>Savi|ours</HI> allowed him, in con&s;ideration of his &s;everal parcels. And whereas al&s;o at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Deanry,</HI> the Gover|nor had taken into his hands the probate of Te&s;taments, and appointed unto civil Courts the cognizance of Matrimoni|all cau&s;es and of tithes: all the&s;e again were re&s;tored unto him, and forever united to this office.</P>
<P>For the executing of this place, there were &s;ome cer|tain Articles, or rather Canons drawn and ratified to be in force till a perfect draught of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions could be agreed on: which it plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to call the <HI>Interim.</HI> And this he did in imitation of <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. which Prince, de&s;irous to e&s;tabli&s;h peace and quiet|ne&s;&s;e in the Church of <HI>Germany;</HI> and little hoping that any Councel would be &s;ummoned &s;oon enough to de|termine of the differences then on foot: compo&s;ed a certain mixture of opinions, in favour of each party; which he en|devoured to obtrude upon that people: the compilers of it, <HI>Julius Pflugi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, Michael Sido<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">us,</HI> and <HI>I&s;lebius:</HI> the time when, <HI>anno</HI> 1594, the name of it the <HI>Interim:</HI> a name given unto it by the Emperor, <HI>eo quod prae&s;criberet formulam doctrinae &amp; cere|moniarum in religione</HI> in terra <HI>tenendam,</HI> quoad <HI>de univer&s;a re re|ligionis concilio publico definitum e&s;&s;et:</HI> &s;o the hi&s;torian of the Councell.

In other matters it little differed from the Canons afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed, and now in being in that I&s;land.</P>
<P>Thus fortified with power, and furni&s;hed with in&s;tru|ctions, home cometh the new <HI>Dean</HI> into his Countrey: and in a frequent a&s;&s;embly of the <HI>three E&s;tates,</HI> takes full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his place, and office.

But this di&s;gu&s;t was quickly over-blown; and the Bailiffe for four years &s;u&s;pended by his Maje&s;ty from the executing of his office. This done, his fellow Mini&s;ters were called together, and he imparted unto them his in&s;tru|ctions.

<P>(1) For what cau&s;e it plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to begin with <HI>Jar&s;ey.</HI> (2) A repre&s;entation of &s;uch mo|tives whereon the like may be effected in the I&s;le of <HI>Guernzey.</HI> (3) The indignity done by a Mi|nister hereof to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> (4) The calling of the Ministers in &s;ome reformed Churches how defen&s;ible.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Now am come unto the fourth and la&s;t part of this di&s;cour&s;e, intended once to have been framed by way of &s;uit unto your Lord&s;hip, in the behalf of the other I&s;land not yet weaned from the brea&s;ts of their late mother of <HI>Geneva.</HI> But finding that cour&s;e not capable of tho&s;e particulars which are to follow; I cho&s;e rather to pur&s;ue that purpo&s;e by way of declaration. My &s;cope and pro|ject, to lay before your Lord&s;hip &s;uch rea&s;ons which may encite you to make u&s;e of that favour which mo&s;t worthily you have attained to with his Maje&s;ty, in the reduction of this I&s;le of <HI>Guernzey</HI> to that antient order by which it formerly was guided, and wherein it held mo&s;t conformity with the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Before I enter on with ar|gument, I &s;hall remove a doubt which might be rai&s;ed about
<PB N="413" REF="231">
this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; as <HI>viz.</HI> For what cau&s;e his late mo&s;t ex|cellent Maje&s;ty proceeded to this alteration in one I&s;land, not in both; and being re&s;olved to try his forces on the one only; why he &s;hould rather &s;ort out <HI>Jar&s;ey.</HI> A doubt without great difficulty to be cleared. For had his Maje&s;ty attem|pted both at once, the Mini&s;ters of both I&s;lands had then communicated coun&s;els, banded them&s;elves in a league, and by a mutuall encouragement continued more peremptory to their old <HI>Mump&s;imus.</HI> It is an antient principle in the arts of Empire, <HI>Divide &amp; impera;</HI> and well noted by the <HI>State-hi&s;torian,</HI> that nothing more advantaged the affaires of <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>Britaine,</HI> then that the natives never met together to rea&s;on of the common danger. <HI>Ita dum &s;inguli pugnabant, univer&s;i vincebantur.</HI> And on the other &s;ide his Maje&s;ty &s;ore|&s;aw for certain, that if one I&s;land once were taken off, the other might with greater ea&s;e be per&s;waded to conforme. Being re&s;olved then to attempt them &s;ingle, there was good rea&s;on why he &s;hould begin with <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> fir&s;t, as unto which he was to &s;end a new Governour, not yet ingaged unto a party, and pliable to his in&s;tructions. Whereas Sir <HI>Tho. Leighton</HI> &s;till continued in his charge at <HI>Guernzey,</HI> who having had &s;o main a hand in the introduction of the Plat-forme, could not be brought with any &s;tomach to intend an alteration of his own coun&s;els.</P>
<P>But not to lo&s;e my &s;elf in the &s;earch of Princes coun|&s;els, which commonly are too far removed from vulgar eyes, let us content our &s;elves with knowing the event; which was, that by his means the I&s;le of <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> was redu|ced unto a Di&s;cipline conformable to that of <HI>England,</HI> and thereby an ea&s;ie way for the reforming al&s;o that in <HI>Guern|zey.</HI> For the accompli&s;hment of which de&s;igne, may it plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip to take notice of the&s;e rea&s;ons fol|lowing, by which it is within my hopes, your Lord|&s;hip po&s;&s;ibly may be per&s;waded to deal in it. <HI>A Jove princi|pium.</HI></P>
<P>And here (as in a Chri&s;tian duty I am bound) I propo&s;e unto your Lord&s;hip in the fir&s;t place, the honour which will redound unto the Lord in this particular, by the re|&s;toring of a <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> unto the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Oratory</HI> of his Church,
<PB N="414" REF="232">
which you a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf to be mo&s;t an&s;werable to his holy word, and to the practice of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> For why may not I &s;ay unto your Lord&s;hip, as <HI>Mardochaus</HI> once to <HI>He&s;ter,</HI> though the ca&s;e be &s;omewhat different, <HI>Who knoweth whether you be come unto the&s;e dignities, for &s;uch a time as this?</HI> And why may it not be &s;aid of you even in the application unto this particular de&s;ignment, <HI>That un|to whom &s;o much is given, of him al&s;o &s;hall much be required?</HI> Pri|vate exployts and undertakings are expected even from private per&s;ons. But God hath rai&s;ed up you to pub|lick honours, and therefore looks that you &s;hould ho|nour him in the advancement and undertaking of &s;uch coun&s;els as may concern his Church in publick. And certainly, if (as I verily per&s;wade my &s;elf) your coun|&s;els tend unto the peace and glory of the Chureh; the Church, I mean, whereof you are &s;o principall a member: You &s;hall not ea&s;ily encounter with an object, whereon your coun&s;els may be better bu&s;ied. So &s;trangely do the&s;e men di&s;grace your ble&s;&s;ed Mother, <HI>and lay her glory in the du&s;t.</HI> Two in&s;tances hereof I &s;hall pre&s;ent unto your Lord&s;hip to &s;et the better edge on your proceedings, though otherwi&s;e I had forborne to meddle with particulars. It plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty for the a&s;&s;urance of the&s;e I&s;lands, to &s;end into each of them two Companies of Souldiers, which were equally di&s;tributed. But &s;uch was the peevi&s;h ob&s;tinacy of one of the Mini&s;ters of this <HI>Guernzey,</HI> that he would not allow their Mini&s;ter to read prayers unto them in his Church, at &s;uch times when him&s;elf and people did not u&s;e it. At la&s;t on much entreaty he was contented to permit it, but with expre&s;&s;e condition, that he &s;hould not either read the <HI>Litany,</HI> or admini&s;ter the <HI>Communion.</HI> Since when, as often as they purpo&s;e to receive the Sacrament, they have been compelled to ferry over to the Ca&s;tle, and in the great hall there celebrate the holy <HI>Supper.</HI> As little is our Church beholding to them in her <HI>Fe&s;tivals,</HI> as in her <HI>Liturgie.</HI> For whereas, at the Town of St. <HI>Peters</HI> on the Sea, they have a Lecture every Thur&s;day, upon which day the Fea&s;t of Chri&s;ts Nativity was &s;olemnized with us in <HI>England, anno</HI> 1623. the &s;ame party cho&s;e rather to put off the Sermon

<P>Next to the honour due to God and to his Church, is that which all of us are obliged to tender to our Princes, as being Gods by office, and <HI>nur&s;ing fathers</HI> of that Church whereof they are. Therefore I repre&s;ent in the next rank unto your Lord&s;hip a con&s;ideration of the honour which you &s;hall here in do unto your Kings. To the one, your late Ma&s;ter of happy memory, who gave you fir&s;t his hand to guide you unto greatne&s;&s;e, in the pur&s;uit of his intendments. So glorious were the purpo&s;es of that Heroick Prince, for the &s;ecure and flouri&s;hing tranquillity of Gods holy Church, that certainly it were impiety if any of them be permitted to mi&s;carry. To the other our now gratious Soveraign, who hath doubled the promotions conferred upon you by his father; in being an author to him of tho&s;e thoughts which may &s;o much redound unto his glory; the rather, becau&s;e, in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty &s;hould find a time convenient to go forward in his Fathers project, of reducing all the Churches <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> unto one <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>Liturgie;</HI> there might not an objecti|on thwart him, drawn from home.

The Mini&s;ters of <HI>Jar&s;ey,</HI> a before I have &s;hown your Lord&s;hip, denyed admi&s;&s;ion to the book of Common-prayer, as not impo&s;ed upon the <HI>Scots;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> better rea&s;on may the <HI>Scots</HI> refu&s;e to entertain it, as not impo&s;ed on tho&s;e of <HI>Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">zey.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the honour due to God, the Church, and to the King, there is an honour next in order to the calling of the Prie&s;t. A calling, as much &s;tomached in generall by all that party, &s;o mo&s;t e&s;pecially reviled by tho&s;e among&s;t our &s;elves for <HI>Antichri&s;tian,</HI> tyrannous, a diveli&s;h ordinance a ba&s;tardly

government, and the like. Nor do I think that tho&s;e of <HI>Guernzey</HI> are better affected to it, though more moderate in profe&s;&s;ing their di&s;like: for did they but approve the hierarchy of Bi&s;hops, they would not then proceed &s;o unwarrantably as now they do, in the ordination of their Mini&s;ters. I cal it unwarrantable proceeding, becau&s;e the lawful and ordinary door of entrance unto the Mini&s;tery, was never &s;hut unto this people; and therefore their prepo&s;terous entry upon this &s;acred calling, either by the <HI>back-door</HI> or by the <HI>window,</HI> the more unan&s;wera|ble. Whereas it may be pleaded in the behalf of tho&s;e in &s;ome parts beyond the &s;eas, that they could not meet with any Bi&s;hops which would give them <HI>ordination,</HI> unle&s;&s;e they would abjure the Go&s;pell as they then profe&s;t it, and therefore that nece&s;&s;ity compelled them to the private way of <HI>impo&s;ing hands</HI> on one another. In which particular, the ca&s;e of &s;ome re|formed Churches, may not unfitly be re&s;embled unto that of <HI>Scipio,</HI> as it is related to us in the third book of <HI>Valerius Max. cap.</HI> 7. upon &s;ome want of money for the furtherance of the nece&s;&s;ary affaires of &s;tate, he demanded a &s;upply from the common trea&s;ury.

In like manner (which is I think the mo&s;t and be&s;t that can be &s;aid in this behalf) to promote the re|formation of Religion, many good men made &s;uit to be &s;up|plyed out of the common trea&s;ury, to be admitted to the preaching of the word according to the ordinary cour&s;e of <HI>ordination;</HI> which when it was denied them by the <HI>Que&s;tors</HI> or <HI>Prelates</HI> of tho&s;e dayes; they cho&s;e rather to receive it at the hands of private and inferior Prie&s;ts, then that the Church &s;hould be unfurni&s;hed. This may be &s;aid for them, which in excu&s;e of tho&s;e of <HI>Guernzey</HI> can never be alleadged; who&s;e con|tinuall recour&s;e unto the&s;e <HI>private keyes</HI> is done upon no other rea&s;on then a di&s;like of that high calling to which your Lord&s;hip is advanced; which therefore you are bound, if not to puni&s;h in them, yet to rectifie.</P>
<P>Two other rea&s;ons yet there are which may invite your Lord&s;hip to this undertaking, though not &s;o weighty or of
<PB N="417" REF="233">
that importance as the former. The one, that the remainders of that party here at home, may not be hardned in their ob&s;tinacy; the other, that tho&s;e of <HI>Jar&s;ey,</HI> be not di&s;couraged in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and conformity. I have already &s;hewn unto your Lord&s;hip, that the brethren here in <HI>England,</HI> never made head again&s;t the Church, till the permi&s;&s;ion of plat-forme in the&s;e I&s;lands. After which, with what violence they did a&s;&s;aile the hierarchy, what clamorus they continually rai&s;ed again&s;t the Prelates, what &s;uper&s;titions and impieties they imputed to our <HI>Liturgy; notius e&s;t quam ut &s;tylo egeat,</HI> is too wel known to be related. If &s;o, then que&s;tionle&s;s it cannot but confirme them in their new devices, to &s;ee them &s;till permitted to this I&s;le. Nor can they think them&s;elves but wronged, that &s;till they are contrould and cen&s;ured for the maintenance of that di&s;cipline, which is by Soveraign authority allowed and licen&s;ed; though in other places, yet in the &s;ame dominions. And on the other &s;ide, your Lord&s;hip may conceive how ju&s;t a cau&s;e of di&s;content and of repining it may be to tho&s;e of <HI>Jar&s;ey;</HI> when they &s;hall dayly hear it thundred from the Coa&s;ts of <HI>France,</HI> that faintly they have &s;old them&s;elves to bondage; whereas the faithfull zelots in the I&s;le of <HI>Guernzey,</HI> doe &s;till pre&s;erve them&s;elves in liberty. <HI>Vel ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">trum flammis ure, velure duos,</HI> as the Lover in <HI>Au&s;onius.</HI></P>
<P>From my fir&s;t rank of motives here pre&s;ented to your Lord|&s;hip, which I may mo&s;t properly call <HI>motives nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> and in re&s;pect unto the cau&s;e; I come next to tho&s;e of an other qua|lity, which I call <HI>motives</HI> of <HI>conveniency,</HI> and in relation to the time. For que&s;tionle&s;&s;e the time is at this pre&s;ent more con|venient for the accompli&s;hment of this work, then ever we may hope to &s;ee hereafter; whether we con&s;ider it in refe|rence unto our Kingdome, or to the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> it &s;elf, or to the Governour, or to the people of both &s;orts, the Clergy and the Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, there is at this in&s;tant, an e&s;tabli&s;hed peace between it and <HI>France,</HI> concluded on while we were in the&s;e I&s;lands, and publi&s;hed immediately on our coming home; which Realm only carryeth a covetous and watchfull eye upon tho&s;e I&s;lands. Were it between us, as it lately was, nothing but wars and depredations; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he alteration then perhaps might
<PB N="418" REF="234">
be un&s;afe, it being alwayes dangerous to di&s;content or charge that Nation, upon who&s;e loyalty we mu&s;t rely. Nor can I tell unto what de&s;perate and undutifull practi&s;es, the furious heat of &s;ome few Preachers may po&s;&s;ibly excite a multitude; when come the wor&s;t that can, there is an enemy at hand that will &s;ub&s;cribe to any articles. But now tis peace, and how long peace will hold, is not ea&s;ie to determine, depending as it doth, upon the will and plea&s;ure of another.</P>
<P>If, in the &s;econd place, we look upon the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> it &s;elf, we &s;hall find it well prepared, and ready for a change. For where|as it is ordered in their <HI>Canons</HI> (if I &s;o may call them) that the errours of the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tory</HI> &s;hall be corrected by the <HI>Colloquie</HI> tho&s;e of the <HI>Colloquie,</HI> by the <HI>Synod;</HI> by the departure of <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> from them, they have no way of further <HI>Synods,</HI> and therefore no re|dre&s;&s;e of grivances. So then either the &s;entence of the <HI>Collo|quie</HI> mu&s;t be unalterable, which is expre&s;ly contrary to the platforme; or el&s;e there mu&s;t be granted &s;ome other <HI>juri&s;dicti|on</HI> to have power above them, whereby their cen&s;ures may be moderated. The fir&s;t of the&s;e would e&s;tate their <HI>Colloquies</HI> in a tyranny more prevalent and binding, then the chair of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;o much complained of. The other openeth a way for the entrance of <HI>Epi&s;copall</HI> authority, for the admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Appeals,</HI> for the directions of their proceedings. Add hereunto, that at this time they have a noble Governour, no friend I am a&s;&s;u|red to any of that party; and &s;uch a one which gladly would re&s;ign tho&s;e rights of old belonging to the <HI>Deanry,</HI> when ever it &s;hall plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty to re&s;tore that dignity unto the I&s;land. A Peer &s;o perfectly known unto your Lord&s;hip and to all the Kingdom, that I need not &s;ay more of him, then that which once <HI>Velleius</HI> did of <HI>Junius Blae&s;us, Vir ne&s;cias an utilior Ca&s;tris, vel melior toga.</HI> It were a matter of no ordinary &s;tudy to determine, whether he be more able in the <HI>Campe</HI> or <HI>Senate.</HI></P>
<P>But in alterations, &s;uch as the&s;e, the fancy and affection of the people is principally to be attended, as tho&s;e whom &s;uch <HI>mutations</HI> mo&s;t properly concern; wherein I find all things made ready to your Lord&s;hips hand, if you vouch&s;afe to &s;et it forwards. The Magi&s;trates and more under&s;tanding people of the I&s;le, offended with the &s;evere and un&s;ociable carriage of
<PB N="419" REF="234">
the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tories,</HI> e&s;pecially of late, &s;ince the unlimited Empire of the <HI>Colloquie</HI> hath made that government un&s;ufferable. Be|fore they had enough to keep them&s;elves from cen&s;ure, and their hou&s;es from the diligence of <HI>Con&s;i&s;toriall</HI> &s;pies; when yet there was an higher Court wherein there was &s;ome hope of re|medy. But there being none to appeal from in the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tory,</HI> but tho&s;e which wil condemn them in the <HI>Colloquie,</HI> they undergo the yoak with much clamour, but with more &s;tomach. A &s;tomach which e&s;t&s;oones they &s;pare not to di&s;gorge upon them, as often, <HI>viz.</HI> as they come within the compa&s;&s;e of their Courts, either in way of puni&s;hment or cen&s;ure. On the other &s;ide the Mini&s;ters exclaime again&s;t the Magi&s;trates, as pre&s;u|ming too far above their latchet; pretending that by them their <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> hath been infringed, their priviledges violated, and their Mini&s;tery interrupted. Matters that have not been repined at only in a corner, but publickly pre&s;ented as on the Theater, and complained of to their Governours. For at my Lord of <HI>Danbies</HI> being there, they articled again&s;t the Magi&s;trates for invading the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall juri&s;diction;</HI> as <HI>viz.</HI> that they take upon them to di&s;&s;olve <HI>contracts</HI> made in the pre&s;ence of the Mini&s;ter, and with an invocation of the name of God, which in judgment of the <HI>Di&s;cipline (Chap.</HI> 12. 1.) are <HI>undi&s;&s;oluble.</HI> That they had intermedled with the admini&s;tration of holy <HI>Bapti&s;me,</HI> a duty meerly &s;pirituall. That they had &s;ei&s;ed upon the trea&s;ures of the Church in &s;ome places, and di&s;po&s;ed of them at their plea&s;ure. That they had cau&s;ed the Mini&s;ters to be impri&s;oned, and there detained them for a long time, to their great di&s;comfort, and the hazard of their <HI>flooks.</HI> And la&s;tly that they had deprived them of the li|berty of Natives in denying them their &s;uffrages for the electi|on of the <HI>Curates.</HI> Other grievances there were, but the&s;e the principall. True it is, that upon due examination of particulars, it did appear that the Magi&s;trates had more rea&s;on in their actions, then the Mini&s;ters in their complaints. But not having been accu&s;tomed to the like u&s;age, they do e&s;teem it a thraldome &s;o incompetent and un&s;upportable, that I per&s;wade my &s;elf they &s;ooner would re&s;olve to yeeld to any cour&s;e, then have their doings croft by that <HI>tribunall.</HI> Sure I am, when they found &s;o &s;mall redre&s;&s;e for the&s;e (as they
<PB N="420" REF="235">
conceived) great oppre&s;&s;ions, they made petition to his Lord|&s;hip to bethink him&s;elf on &s;ome other way for their relief, and laboured to procure me to be their Mediator to his Lord&s;hip in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances al&s;o happily concurring, portend, in my opinion, as great an alteration in this &s;tate <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall,</HI> as the conjunction of &s;ome powerfull Planets doth &s;ometimes upon the temporall. And if your Lord&s;hip &s;hould be wan|ting now unto pre&s;ent opportunity, it may be &s;uch a con|fluence of preparatives and helps may hardly be met withall hereafter. Pre&s;uming therefore, that your Lord&s;hip will not neglect the advantage offered, I &s;hould next proceed unto tho&s;e means which might be&s;t be u&s;ed in the effecting of this work; but what were this but to read a lecture of the wars to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> to play a part on the Stage in the &s;ight of <HI>Ro&s;cius?</HI> For whether your Lord&s;hip &s;hall think mo&s;t fit to treat fir&s;t of it with my Lord the Governour, that he may make plain the way before you, and facilitate the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; or whether it may be thought mo&s;t proper, that &s;ome negotiate with the people and the <HI>Jurates,</HI> to commence a &s;uit in this behalf un|to the Councell; or whether that the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, in this conjuncture of time, oppre&s;&s;ed, as they conceive it, by the Civill Magi&s;trates encroaching on them, may not with great facility be per&s;waded to &s;ollicite for a change; who can &s;o well determine as your Lord&s;hip, whom long expe|rience and naturall abilities have made perfect in the&s;e arts? Only let me be&s;eech your Lord&s;hips leave to enjoy mine own folly, and for a while to act my part, to read my lecture, though <HI>Hannibal</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> be in pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>At &s;uch time as by the Mini&s;ters his Lord&s;hip was petiti|oned to re&s;olve upon &s;ome cour&s;e for their relief; they made reque&s;t to me to &s;ollicite for them their de&s;ires, to be a remem|brancer for them to his Lord&s;hip. To which I an&s;wered, that I could direct them in a way which &s;hould for ever free them from that yoak which &s;o much they feared, and if they would vouch&s;afe to &s;ee my Chamber, I would there impart it. A motion not made unto the wals, or lo&s;t in the propo&s;all; for down unto my Lodging they de&s;cended, and there we joyned our &s;elves in Councell. The Petitioners were five in number,
<PB N="421" REF="235">
<HI>viz. De la March, Millet, Perchard, Picote,</HI> and <HI>De la Place;</HI> my &s;elf alone, and not provided (&s;ave in Wine and Sider) for their entertainment. But as <HI>Lactantius</HI> in an equall ca&s;e, <HI>Nece&s;&s;e e&s;t, ut me cau&s;ae bonitas fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">at eloquentem;</HI> pre&s;uming on the goodne&s;&s;e of my cau&s;e, but more upon their ignorance, I was re&s;olved to bid them battail. Immediately upon the opening of the Coun&s;ell, I was importuned my opinion; whereto I freely made them an&s;wer, the only cour&s;e whereby they might &s;ub&s;i&s;t entire and free from bondage, was to ad|dre&s;s them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty for the re&s;titution of the <HI>Dean.</HI> But this &s;ay they is Phy&s;ick wor&s;e then the di&s;ea&s;e; and there|upon the battails began to joyn with greater violence; with violence it was, and therefore (as we are in&s;tructed in <HI>Philo&s;o|phy)</HI> of no long continuance; for pre&s;ently upon the fir&s;t en|counter their ranks were broken, and their forces di&s;united. <HI>Picote</HI> for his part prote&s;ted, that he had alwayes been an ene|my to <HI>Lay Elders,</HI> and that he could not &s;ee by what authority of Scripture they were permitted in the Churches. <HI>Perchard</HI> was well enough content, that the di&s;pen&s;ing of the poor mans box might be committed unto others, and that the <HI>Deacons</HI> as being a degree or &s;tep unto the Mini&s;tery, might be employed about the trea&s;ures of &s;alvation. <HI>Millet</HI> &s;tood &s;ilent all the while, and as I think re&s;erved him&s;elf to try the fortune of another day. <HI>De la March</HI> and <HI>De la Place</HI> (this <HI>De la Place</HI> is he who aban|doned <HI>Jar&s;ey</HI> upon his failing of the <HI>Dean&s;hip)</HI> what they could not make good by rea&s;on, &s;upplied by ob&s;tinacy. In my life I never knew men more willing to betray a cau&s;e, or le&s;&s;e able to maintain it. My inference hereupon is this, that if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;ignifie unto them, that it is his royall plea|&s;ure to admit a <HI>Dean</HI> among them, or el&s;e repair unto the Court to give a rea&s;on of their refu&s;all; they &s;ooner would for&s;ake and quit their cau&s;e, then either be re&s;olved to agree about it, or venture to defend it. If I were &s;ure to make no u&s;e of <HI>Logick,</HI> till the&s;e men &s;hal run the hazard of a <HI>di&s;puta|tion,</HI> I would pre&s;ently go and burn my <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI></P>
<P>To draw unto an end, for I have been too tedious to your Lord&s;hip. Before I pluck off my di&s;gui&s;e and leave the &s;tage whereon I act, I could me thinks add &s;omewhat here about the choicing of a man mo&s;t fit for this authority. In which
<PB N="422" REF="236">
particular, as I &s;tand well affected to <HI>Perchard,</HI> for a moderate and quiet man, &s;o hath he al&s;o a good repute in all the I&s;land, both for his vein of Preaching, his liberall ho&s;pitality, and plau&s;ible demeanor. Or if your Lord&s;hip think a fo|rainer more fit, there being now the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Saviours</HI> void, and &s;o full room for that <HI>induction,</HI> I dur&s;t propo&s;e to you <HI>Olivier</HI> of <HI>Jar&s;ey;</HI> a man which I per&s;wade my &s;elf, I may &s;ay &s;afely, not inferiour unto any of both I&s;lands in point of Scholar&s;hip, and well affected to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> form of Go|vernment. Add to this that already he is acquainted with the nature of the place, as having executed the office of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> or <HI>Subdean,</HI> ever &s;ince the introduction of the charge, and therefore not to &s;eek in the managing and cari|age of his juri&s;diction. But good God! what follies do we dayly run into, when we conceive our &s;elves to be di&s;gui&s;ed, and that our actions are not noted? It is therefore high time for me to unmaske my &s;elf, and humbly crave your Lord|&s;hips pardon, that under any habit I &s;hould take upon me to advi&s;e. A further <HI>plaudite</HI> then this I do not &s;eek for, then that you will vouch&s;afe to excu&s;e my boldne&s;&s;e, though not allow it: the rather becau&s;e a zeal unto the beauteous uni|formity of the Church did prompt me to it. But this, and this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uch as it is, I con&s;ecrate unto your Lord&s;hip; for who&s;e honour, next under Gods, I have principally pur|&s;ued this argument. For my &s;elf, it will be unto me &s;ufficient glory, that I had any, though the lea&s;t, hand in &s;uch a pious work; and &s;hall be happy, if in this, or in any other your Lord&s;hips coun&s;els for the Churches peace, I may be worthy of imployment. Nor need your Lord&s;hip fear, that in the pro&s;ecution of this project, you may be charged with an in|novation. To pur&s;ue this purpo&s;e is not to introduce a <HI>novelty</HI> but to re&s;tore a <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> to revive the perfect &s;ervice of God, which &s;o long hath been, to &s;ay the be&s;t of it, in a <HI>Lethargy,</HI> and to make the <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h Empire,</HI> like a <HI>City which is at unity within it &s;elf.</HI></P>
