<P N="2">2 Indeed &s;ome People bring a bad report of this Land, as if the Inhabitants were &s;ubject to many Di&s;|ea&s;es, I'le a&s;&s;ure you they make them&s;elves little reckoning of any of their maladies: they are troubled with Clapdollars, Botches, Worms, Pains in the Head, and Burning Feavours, but the&s;e are the favours of their Women, to whom they are inexpre&s;&s;ably addi|cted, who&s;e foul corruption and &s;ores they pa&s;s by as if they ailed nothing, &s;uffering their Wounds to &s;well and putrifie, without any means of remedy applyed thereunto; for they neither have, nor u&s;e any Phy&s;ick among them, to ea&s;e them in their &s;ickne&s;s, nor Surge|ry to heal their Wounds, but let their Infirmities have their own cour&s;e; whence I conclude, that if the Art
<PB N="10" REF="9">and Skill of <HI>Europe</HI> did a while dwell in tho&s;e parts, it would abate their malignancy, and correct their un|healthine&s;s; for now of late, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay for the Pox and Clap-dollars, they u&s;e much <HI>Sal&s;a Parillia,</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have furni&s;hed them with, and they &s;eeth it in Salt-water and drink.</P>
<P>For the Pain in the Head, they make a Pap of green Leaves, and annoint the place affected.</P>
<P>If they have any Swelling about their Body which doth not break, they cut two or three &s;la&s;hes therein with a knife, and &s;o give the wound a means to work, heal up, and grow together again; thats the rea&s;on their fle&s;h commonly ri&s;eth in knobs: Nay, they have of late found out the way of Letting Blood, but it's a barbarous one, for they only make a hole in their bo|dies with a Knife, to let their blood come out.</P>
<P>People &s;o inhumane to them&s;elves, cannot be kinde to others; as they will not help them&s;elves, &s;o they will not comfort one another; but if one be ami&s;s, they &s;hun him as it were the Plague, and &s;purn the &s;ick man like a Dog, and not once help him with a drop of Oyl or Water, though he hath never &s;o much need, &s;uf|fering him to dye, as he lived, like a Bea&s;t, and &s;tarve with hunger, rather than peri&s;h with weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>For all this they live to be Old, though they cannot reckon their own Age, nor tell how many years they have lived; and to &s;peak the truth, cannot endure to think of their decay, growing no le&s;s deformed and de&s;picable when pa&s;&s;ed Thirty, than they do amiable and lovely until they arrive to it; their Skin then hang|ing loo&s;e like old Hogs Bladders, and ill-favouredly wrinkled like <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather.</P>
<P>There is a kinde of long Worm, that ari&s;eth in the
<PB N="11" REF="9">Legs, Arms, and Thighs of &s;ome men that come hi|ther, either before, after, or in their voyages, and but of &s;ome; many having gone &s;everal Voyages thither, and never knew what they meant, <HI>Ki&s;&s;ing goeth by fa|vour:</HI> About the Ca&s;tle <HI>Aleria,</HI> they are very rife, but Twenty five miles lower, very rare, and the very In|habitants of St. <HI>Thome,</HI> the unwhole&s;ome&s;t place in the world, an Ho&s;pital, rather than a Plantation, under|&s;tand as little what the&s;e Worms are, as we do; they have worms &s;ure in their brains that are afraid of them, for there is no more in it than this,</P>
<P>There are certain &s;howers called <HI>Alvais,</HI> that fall at certain times of the year, wherein if you are caught, you mu&s;t run home and wa&s;h your cloaths, and making a great &s;traw fire, lye along, and hold the &s;oles of your Feet again&s;t that fire for an hour; doing this there is no harm done, but neglecting it, your cloaths will rot off of your backs: The&s;e Worms will grow in your Legs or Thighs, as if your veins &s;welled, with a &s;ha|king and a Feavour, and &s;uch pains, as that you can neither &s;it nor lye &s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes &s;o, as that you are not &s;en&s;ible of them.</P>
<P>The Worm appeareth in &s;ome like a &s;pot or a flea|biting, in &s;ome like a little Blain, and in &s;ome with a little Swelling, &s;o that you may often &s;ee the Worm between the Skin and the Fle&s;h: There is no reme|dy again&s;t it, till you &s;ee it &s;eeking to break out, and hold out it's no&s;e, which you mu&s;t immediately lay hold of, le&s;t he creep in again; They are mo&s;t dange|rous in the Cods, but the way is,</P>
<P N="1">1 To be quiet, e&s;pecially when they are in the Legs, and not go much, and to keep the place warm where they begin to appear: when they come forth &s;o far that
<PB N="12" REF="10">a man may lay hold of them, they mu&s;t be gently drawn until they &s;top, and then you mu&s;t let them re&s;t, applying &s;ome exciting and provoking plai&s;ter, till they come forth again, and as much as comes out mu&s;t be wound upon a &s;tick or pin, or bound clo&s;e to the orifice with a thred, that it creepeth not in again; if it breaks or draws back, it poy&s;oneth or fe&s;tereth the part; if it comes out whole, it draweth with it the corruption of the whole body, and makes a man met|tle proof again&s;t the Malignancy of <HI>Guinney;</HI> &s;o that I know not whether it bee their Di&s;ea&s;e or Phy&s;ick, &s;omething to <HI>heal,</HI> or &s;omething to <HI>puni&s;h:</HI> This is the common apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e Worms, yet have I known men, that let them have their cour&s;e, wa&s;hing the place with Salt water, and though they returned into the Leg, &s;aw them con&s;umed to no|thing with ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>But when all comes to all, this is certain, that keep but fre&s;h water of your own, or dig the water of that Country &s;ome &s;ix fathomes deep, under the &s;alt-wa|ter, as they do in <HI>Ormus,</HI> and you are as <HI>&s;ound</HI> as a <HI>Bell.</HI></P>
<P>It's true indeed, that upon &s;ome &s;howers of Rain, there is &s;uch a &s;tinck &s;ometimes, as forceth &s;trangers to go &s;ome Leagues off into the Sea; but it is as true that there is &s;uch a &s;tinck in <HI>London,</HI> that there was a man I knewupon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> who could never &s;tay in Town above an hour, in&s;omuch that he rid Twelve miles every day he came to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and tied his Hor&s;e to a Pillar there, took a turn or two, grew &s;ick, and immediately took his Hor&s;e and rid Po&s;t out, and this at lea&s;t three times a week: There are &s;ome people that Swound at the &s;mell of a Ro&s;e, and others

<P>No man claimeth any Land to him&s;elf; the King keeping all the Woods, Fields, and Land in his hands; &s;o that they neither Sow nor Plant therein, but by his con&s;ent and licence, which when they have obtain|ed, and have a place permitted them to Sow their Corn in; then they go with theit Slaves and burn their Woods, Trees, Roots, and Shrubs to the ground; af|ter this they take their long Chopping-knives, which they call <HI>Coddon,</HI> and &s;crape up the ground about a foot deep, and let it lye eight or ten daies.</P>

<P>When they have all Tilled their Ground, every man takes his &s;eed upon their Sunday, that is as you &s;hall hear anon, our Tue&s;day, the better day the bet|ter deed; and goeth to the Kings hou&s;e, whom they &s;erve fir&s;t, and then (after a Treatment of a &s;od Goat, with Palm Wine, to which they fit and &s;ing about the burnt Roots, in the honour of their <HI>Feti&s;&s;o</HI> or <HI>God,</HI> that their Corn might grow well and pro&s;perou&s;ly upon the Earth) to their Neighbours, who&s;e allotments they Husband by turns, until the whole Countrey is &s;owed, where the Corn &s;oon groweth up, lying not long in the Ground, and &s;prouts as high as a Mans head, at which time they make a woodden Hou&s;e in the middle of the Field, covered with Reeds, where|in their Children watch the Corn, and drive away the Birds, wherewith they are much cumbred.</P>
<P>Their Ground being rank, the Corn is very weedy, yet they weed it not, but let it grow up weeds and all.</P>
<P>Their Corn is of two &s;orts, 1 Milly. 2 Mais.</P>
<P N="1">1 Milly, and that hath long Ears, and is a &s;eed of colour like Hemp-&s;eed, and long like Canary-&s;eed, having no &s;hells, but growing in a little husk, which is very white within. This Grain groweth ripe in three months, and when cut down, it lyeth a month in the Fields to dry, and then the canes are cut off and bound in Sheaves (the &s;traw being re&s;erved for Thatch) mak|ing whol&s;ome and &s;weet Bread; when they have paid the Kings Rent, every one according to his ability, and furni&s;hed the poor for Gold.</P>
<P N="2">2 Mais, called by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugez, Turk|i&s;h Wheat;</HI> and brought out of <HI>We&s;t India</HI> into St. <HI>Thomes</HI> I&s;land, and from St. <HI>Thomes</HI> hither by the <HI>Portugez,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="11">is mixed with <HI>Milly,</HI> and makes excellent <HI>Me&s;&s;ellan,</HI> though it is very good alone; and the&s;e Negroes make Bread with it, that will la&s;t three or four months; their Children al&s;o eating it in&s;tead of Bread, which they &s;et a while upon the fire, and then cru&s;h the Corn out of the Husk, which breeds the Scurvy and the Itch.</P>
<P>But give me Mais, that makes the Wine called <HI>Chicha</HI> (wherewith the Negroes are dead drunk once a week) by being laid to &s;oke in water till it is &s;oft; and indeed it groweth in a moi&s;t and &s;alty ground, as if it were a drunken Grain, bearing twice a year, and being not &s;owed like other Corn, but thru&s;t into the Ground: It looks like Reeds in a Mar&s;h ground, and every Reed hath his Ears whereon the Corn groweth, and notwith&s;tanding that they are heavy Ears, as big as your Cucumbers, yet every Reed hath &s;even or eight Ears upon it, in&s;omuch that I have told five hundred and fifty Grains upon one Reed, which came of one Grain alone.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a Tree called Palm, who&s;e Bark they bore, and draw out of it mo&s;t curious &s;weet Wine, which mingled with a little water, is the be&s;t drink in the world, and excellent Oyl, wherewith they make their bodies &s;hine, be&s;ides this nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>In the tempe&s;tuous and rainy time of <HI>April, May,</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> the rain being &s;ometimes &s;o hot, as if it were warm water, the poor &s;illy people are &s;imply a|fraid of it, and do what they can that not a drop of it fall on their bodies, and if any happen to do &s;o, they &s;hiver and &s;hake, as if they had a Feavour, until they have found the way to Annoint their bodies with this Oyl, &s;o that a Negroe looks like a <HI>Spani&s;h-leather</HI> pair of Boots well liquoured.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="12">
<P>Here groweth <HI>Bunnana,</HI> or the <HI>Indian</HI> Fig, not on the Branches, as other Fruit, but on the body of the Tree, covered with leaves a fathome long, and three &s;pans broad, which leaves are u&s;ed in their hou&s;es for paper, the Tree indeed being nothing el&s;e but a few leaves patched together; It is as high as a man, on the top the leaves begin to &s;pring out, and ri&s;e up an end, and as the young leaves come forth, the old ones wi|ther away and begin to dry, until the Tree comes to his growth, and the fruit to perfection. The leaves in the middle have a very thick vein, which divideth it in two; and in the middle of the leaves, out of the heart of the Tree there groweth a flower as big as an O&s;tridge-Egge, of a ru&s;&s;et colour, which in time wax|eth long like the &s;talk of a Colewort, whereon the Figs grow clo&s;e one by another; when they are &s;till in their husks, they are not much unlike great Beans, and &s;o grow more and more until they be a &s;pan long, and four thumbs broad, like a Cucumber; They are cut off before they are ripe, and are in that &s;ort hang|ed up in bunches, which oftentimes are as much as a man can carry.</P>

Others there were, which they call the Teeth of Calves, of one or two or three years, whereof &s;ome were a foot and a half, &s;ome two foot, and &s;ome three or more, according to the age of the Bea&s;t. The&s;e great Teeth, or Tusks, grow in the upper jaw down|ward, and not in the nether jaw upward, wherein the Painters and Arras-workers are deceived. At this

<P>The Elephant (which &s;ome call Oliphant) is the bigge&s;t of all four footed Bea&s;t, his fore legs are long|er than his hinder, he hath ancles in the lower part of his hinder legs, and five toes on his feet undivided; his &s;nout or trunk is &s;o long, and in &s;uch form, that it is to him in&s;tead of a hand, for he neither eateth nor drinketh, but by bringing his trunk to his mouth; therewith he helpeth up his Ma&s;ter or keeper, there|with hee overthroweth trees: Be&s;ide his two great tusks, he hath on every &s;ide of his mouth four teeth, wherewith he eateth and grindeth his meat; either of the&s;e teeth are almo&s;t a &s;pan in length, as they grow along in the jaw, and are about two inches in height, and almo&s;t as much in thickne&s;s. The tusks of the Male are greater than the tusks of the Female; his

When the Male hath once &s;ea&s;oned the Female, he never after toucheth her. The Male E|lephant liveth two hundred years, or at the lea&s;t one hundred and twenty, the Female almo&s;t as long, but the flower of their age is but three&s;core years, as &s;ome write; they cannot &s;uffer winter or cold, they love rivers, and will often go to them up to the &s;nout, wherewith they blow and &s;nuff, and play in the wa|ter, but &s;wim they cannot, for the weight of their bodies. <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Soline</HI> &s;ay, that they u&s;e no adultery: If they happen to meet a man in the wilderne&s;s, being out of the way, gently they will go before him, and bring him into the plain way; Joyned in battle, they have no &s;mall re&s;pect to them that be wounded, for they bring them that are hurt or weary into the mid|dle of the army to bee defended, they are made tame by drinking the juice of Barbery.

<PB N="34" REF="21">runneth out of him mingled together, which be|ing cold, is congealed into that &s;ub&s;tance which the A|pothecaries call <HI>Sanguis Draconis,</HI> (that is) Dragons blood, otherwi&s;e called <HI>Cinnabaris,</HI> although there be another kinde of <HI>Cinnabaris,</HI> commonly called <HI>Cinnoper,</HI> or <HI>Vermillion,</HI> which the Painters u&s;e in certain colours.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o of three kindes, as of the Mar&s;hes, the Plains, and the Mountains, no le&s;s differing in conditions. <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> writeth, that as much as the Elephant of <HI>Lybia</HI> in bigne&s;s, pa&s;&s;eth the Hor&s;e of <HI>Ny&s;ea,</HI> &s;o much do the Elephants of <HI>India,</HI> exceed them of <HI>Lybia;</HI> for the Elephants of <HI>India,</HI> &s;ome have been &s;een of the height of nine Cubits; the other do &s;o greatly fear the&s;e, that they dare not abide the &s;ight of them. Of the <HI>Indian</HI> Elephants, only the Male have Tusks, but of them of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> both of them have Tusks: They are of diver&s;e heights, as of twelve, thirteen, and fourteen <HI>Dodrants,</HI> every <HI>Dodrant</HI> being a mea&s;ure of nine Inches. Some write that an Elephant is bigger than three wilde Oxen or Buffs; they of <HI>India</HI> are black, or of the colour of a Mou&s;e, but they of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> or <HI>Guinney,</HI> are brown; the hide or skin of them all is very hard, and without hair or bri&s;tles; their ears are two <HI>Dodrants</HI> broad, and their eyes very little.</P>
<P>Of other properties and conditions of the Elephant, as of their marvellous docilities, of their fight and u&s;e in the Wars, of their generation and cha&s;tity, when they were fir&s;t &s;een in the Theatres and Triumphs of the <HI>Romans,</HI> how they are taken and made tame, and when they ca&s;t their tusks, of the u&s;e of the &s;ame in Medicines, who&s;o de&s;ireth to know, let him read <HI>Pli|ny</HI> in the eight book of his Natural Hi&s;tory.

<PB N="35" REF="21">writeth in his twelfth book, that in old time they made many goodly works of Ivory, or Elephants teeth; as Tables, Tre&s;&s;es, Po&s;ts of hou&s;es, Rails, Latte&s;&s;es for windows, Images of their Gods, and divers other things of Ivory, both coloured and uncoloured, and intermixed with &s;undry kindes of precious woods, as at this day are made certain Chairs, Lutes, and Virgi|nals. They had &s;uch plenty thereof in old times, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> writeth, that one of the Gates of <HI>Hieru&s;alem</HI> was called <HI>Porta Eburnea,</HI> (that is) the Ivory Gate: The whitene&s;s thereof was &s;o much e&s;teemed, that it was thought to repre&s;ent the natural fairne&s;s of a mans skin, in&s;omuch that &s;uch as went about to &s;et forth (or rather corrupt) natural beauty, with colours and pain|ting, were reproved by this proverb, <HI>Ebur atramento Candefacere,</HI> (that is) to make Ivory white with Ink.

<P>Now therefore to &s;peak &s;omewhat of the People, their manners, and manner of living, with another brief de&s;cription of <HI>Affrica</HI> al&s;o: It is to bee under|&s;tood, that the People which now inhabit the regions of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinney,</HI> and the middle parts of <HI>Af|frica,</HI> as <HI>Lybia</HI> the inner, and <HI>Nubia,</HI> with diver&s;e o|ther great and large regions about the &s;ame, were in old time called <HI>Aethiopes,</HI> and <HI>Nigritae,</HI> which we now call <HI>Moors, Moorens,</HI> or <HI>Negroes,</HI> a People of bea&s;tly living, without a God, Law, Religion, or Common|wealth; and &s;o &s;corched and vexed with the heat of the Sun, that in many places they cur&s;e it when it ri|&s;eth.

<P>Some write that <HI>Affrica</HI> was &s;o named by the <HI>Graeci|ans,</HI> becau&s;e it is without cold; for the <HI>Greek</HI> letter <HI>Alpha,</HI> or <HI>A,</HI> &s;ignifieth privation, void, or without; and <HI>Phrice</HI> &s;ignifieth cold; for indeed, although in&s;tead of winter they have a cloudy and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on, yet is it not cold, but al&s;o &s;moothering hot, with hot &s;howers of rain al&s;o; and &s;omewhere &s;uch &s;corching winds, that what by one means and other, they &s;eem at certain times to live as it were in furnaces, and in manner already half way in Purgatory or Hell. <HI>Gem|ma Phri&s;ius</HI> writeth, that in certain parts of <HI>Affrica,</HI> as in <HI>Atlas</HI> the greater, the Air in the night &s;ea&s;on is &s;een &s;hining with many &s;trange fires and flames, ri&s;ing in manner as high as the Moon; and that in the Ele|ments are &s;ometime heard as it were, &s;ometimes the &s;ound of Pipes, Trumpets, and Drums; which noi&s;e perhaps, may be cau&s;ed by the vehement, and &s;undry
<PB N="40" REF="24">motions of &s;uch fiery exhalations in the Air; as we &s;ee the like in many experiences wrought by Fire, Air, and Wind; the hollowne&s;s al&s;o, and diver&s;e reflecti|ons al&s;o, and breakings of the Clouds, may be great cau&s;e hereof, be&s;ides the vehement cold of the mid|dle region of the Air, whereby the &s;aid fiery exhalations a&s;cending thither, are &s;uddenly &s;tricken back with great force; for men, common and dayly experience teach|eth us, by the whi&s;&s;ing of a burning Torch, what noi&s;e Fire maketh in the Air, and much where it &s;tri|veth when it is inclo&s;ed with Air, as appeareth in Guns, and as the like is &s;een in only Air inclo&s;ed, as in Or|gan-Pipes, and &s;uch other in&s;truments that go by wind: For wind (as &s;ay the Philo&s;ophers) is none o|ther then Air vehemently moved; as we &s;ee in a pair of Bellows, and &s;uch other.</P>
<P>Some men of good credit that were in this Voyage to <HI>Guinney,</HI> affirm earne&s;tly, that in the night &s;ea&s;on, they felt a &s;en&s;ible heat to come from the beams of the Moon; the which thing, though it be &s;trange and in|&s;en&s;ible to us that inhabit cold regions, yet doth it &s;tand with good rea&s;on that it &s;o may be, for as much as the nature of Stars and Planets (as writeth <HI>Pliny</HI>) con&s;i&s;teth of Fire, and containeth in it a &s;pirit of life, which cannot be without Heat.</P>
<P>And that the Moon giveth Heat upon the Earth, the Prophet <HI>David</HI> &s;eemeth to confirm, in his 121 <HI>P&s;a.</HI> where &s;peaking of &s;uch men as are defended from e|vils by Gods protection, hee &s;aith thus, <HI>Per diem Sol non exurat te, nec Luna per noctem;</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>In the day the Sun &s;hall not burn thee, nor the Moon by night.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ay furthermore, that in certain places of the Sea, they &s;aw certain &s;treams of water, which they
<PB N="41" REF="24">call &s;pouts, falling out of the Air into the Sea, and that &s;ome of the&s;e are as big as the great Pillars of Churches, in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes they fall into Ships, and put them in great danger of drowning: Some feign, that the&s;e &s;hould bee the Cataracts of Heaven, which were all opened at <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood; But I think them rather to bee &s;uch fluxions and erupti|ons, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his book <HI>De Mundo</HI> &s;aith, do chance in the Sea; for &s;peaking of &s;uch &s;trange things as are often &s;een in the Sea, hee writeth thus; <HI>Oftentimes al|&s;o even in the Sea are &s;een evaporations of Fire, and &s;uch eruptions and breaking forth of Springs, that the mouths of Rivers are opened: Whirle-pools, and fluxions are cau|&s;ed of &s;uch other vehement motions, not only in the mid&s;t of the Sea, but al&s;o in Creeks and Streights; At certain times al&s;o, a great quantity of water is lifted up, and car|ried about with the Moon,</HI> &amp;c. By which words of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> it doth appear, that &s;uch waters bee lifted up in one place, at one time, and do &s;uddenly fall down in another place, at another time. And here|unto perhaps pertaineth it, that <HI>Richard Chanceller</HI> re|lated, that hee heard <HI>Seba&s;tion Cabot</HI> report, that a|bout the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> or <HI>Rio de Platu,</HI> his Ship, or Pinnace, was &s;uddenly lifted from the Sea, and ca&s;t upon Land. The which thing, and &s;uch other like wonderful and &s;trange works of nature, while we con|&s;ider, and call to remembrance the narrowne&s;s of mans under&s;tanding and knowledge, in compari&s;on of her mighty power, wee can but cea&s;e to marvel and con|fe&s;s with <HI>Pliny,</HI> that nothing is to her impo&s;&s;ible; the lea&s;t part of who&s;e power is not yet known to men.</P>
<P>Many things more the Travellers ob&s;erved in this Voyage, worthy to be noted, whereof I thought good
<PB N="42" REF="25">to put &s;ome in memory, that the Reader may as well take plea&s;ure in the variety of things, as knowledge of the Hi&s;tory. Among other things therefore, touching the manners and nature of the People, this may &s;eem &s;trange, that their Princes and Noble Men u&s;e to pounce and ra&s;e their skins, with pretty knots in di|ver&s;e forms, as it were branched Damask, thinking that to bee a decent ornament; and albeit they go in manner almo&s;t naked, yet are many of them, and e&s;peci|ally their women, in manner laden with Collars, Brace|lets, Hoops, and Chains, either of Gold, Copper, or Ivory; their Ivory Bracelets are made of one whole peece, of the bigge&s;t part of the tooth, turned &amp; &s;ome|what carved, with a hole in the mid&s;t, wherein they put their hands to wear it on their arms: Some have on every one eight, &amp; as many on their legs, wherewith &s;ome of them are &s;o galled, that although they are in manner made lame thereby, yet will they by no means leave them off: Some al&s;o wear on their legs great Shackles of fine Copper, which they think to bee no le&s;s comely; they wear al&s;o Collars, Bracelets, Gar|lands, and Girdles, of certain blew Stones, like Beads; likewi&s;e &s;ome of their women wear on their bare arms, certain fore-&s;leeves, made of the Plate of beaten Gold; On their fingers al&s;o they wear Rings, made of Gold wires, with a knot or wreath, like unto that which chil|dren make in a Ring of a Ru&s;h: Among other things that our men bought of them for exchange of their Wares, were certain Dogs-Chains, and Collars.</P>
<P>They are very wary people in their bargaining, and will not lo&s;e one &s;park of Gold of any value; they u&s;e weights and mea&s;ures, and are very circum&s;pect in occupying the &s;ame; they that &s;hall have to do with
<PB N="43" REF="25">them mu&s;t u&s;e them gently, for they will not traffick or bring in any Wares, if they be ill u&s;ed. At the fir&s;t Voy|age that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men had into the&s;e parts, it &s;o chan|ced, that at their departure from the fir&s;t place, where they did Traffick, one of them either &s;tole away a Musk-Cat, or took her away by force, not mi&s;tru&s;t|ing that that &s;hould have hindred their bargaining in another place, whither they intended to go; but for all the ha&s;te that they could make with full &s;ails, the fame of their mi&s;u&s;age &s;o prevented them, that the people of that place al&s;o, offended thereby, would bring in no Wares; in&s;omuch that they were inforced either to re&s;tore the Cat, or pay for her at their price, before they could Traffick there.</P>
<P>Their Hou&s;es are made of four po&s;ts or trees, and covered with boughs.</P>
<P>Their common feeding is of Roots, and &s;uch Fi&s;hes as they take, whereof they have great plenty.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;uch flying Fi&s;hes, as are &s;een in the Sea of the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men &s;alted of their Fi&s;h, hoping to provide &s;tore thereof, but they would not take &s;alt, and mu&s;t therefore bee eaten forthwith as &s;ome &s;ay: Howbeit others affirm, that if they be &s;alted immediately after they are taken, they will la&s;t uncorrupted ten or twelve daies. But this is more &s;trange, that part of &s;uch Fle&s;h as they carried with them out of <HI>England,</HI> which putrified there, became &s;weet again, at their return to the clime of temperate Regions.</P>
<P>They u&s;e al&s;o a &s;trange making of Bread, in this man|ner.</P>
<P>They grinde between two &s;tones, as much Corn as they think may &s;uffice their family; and when they
<PB N="44" REF="26">have thus brought it to flower, they put thereto a certain quantity of water, and make thereof very thin dough, which they &s;tick upon &s;ome po&s;ts of their Hou&s;es, where it is baked by the heat of the Sun; &s;o that when the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, or any of his Fa|mily will eat thereof, they take it down and eat it.</P>
<P>They have very fair Wheat, the ear whereof is two handfulls in length, and as big as a great Bulru&s;h, and almo&s;t four inches about, where it is bigge&s;t; the &s;tem or &s;traw &s;eemeth to bee almo&s;t as big, as the lit|tle finger of a mans hand, or little le&s;s. The grains of their Wheat are as big as our Pea&s;on, round al&s;o and very white, and &s;omewhat &s;hining, like Pearls that have lo&s;t their colour: Almo&s;t all the &s;ub&s;tance of them turneth into flower, and maketh little bran or none: I told in one ear, two hundred and three&s;core grains. The ear is inclo&s;ed in three Blades, longer than it &s;elf, and of two inches broad a peece. And by this fruitfulne&s;s, the Sun &s;eemeth partly to recom|pence &s;uch griefs and mole&s;tations, as they otherwi&s;e receive by the fervent heat thereof. It is doubtle&s;s a worthy contemplation, to con&s;ider the contrary ef|fects of the Sun; or rather the contrary pa&s;&s;ions of &s;uch things as receive the influence of his beams, either to their hurt or benefit. Their drink is either water, or the juice that droppeth from the cut branches of the barren Date-trees, called <HI>Palmitos;</HI> for either they hang great Gourds at the &s;ame branches every even|ing, and let them hang &s;o all night, or el&s;e they &s;et them on the ground under the trees, that the drops may fall therein: They &s;ay that this kinde of drink, is in ta&s;te much like unto Whey, but &s;omewhat &s;weet|er and more plea&s;ant: They cut the branches every
<PB N="45" REF="26">evening, becau&s;e they are &s;ealed up in the day, by the heat of the Sun; they have al&s;o great Beans, as big as Che&s;s nuts, and very hard, with a &s;hell in&s;tead of a Husk.</P>
<P>At their return, the Keels of their Ships were mar|vellou&s;ly over grown with certain &s;hells, of two inches length and more, as thick as they could &s;tand, and &s;o big, that a man might put his finger in their mouth; out of which &s;ome think are generated the Fouls, wee call Barnacles.</P>
<P>Among other things that chanced to them in this Voyage, this is to bee ob&s;erved, that whereas they &s;ailed thither in &s;even weeks, they could not return in twenty; the rea&s;on whereof is this, that about the Coa&s;t <HI>Cape Virde,</HI> the wind is ever at the Ea&s;t, by rea&s;on whereof they are enforced to &s;ail farre out of their cour&s;e, into the main Ocean, to finde the wind at the We&s;t, to bring them home, going &s;o far, that they had the Sun North of them at noon.</P>

<P>WIth much ado did wee get out of the <HI>Hope</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> ten daies after wee were in one and thirty degrees of Latitude; the fifteenth of <HI>November,</HI> wee got &s;ight of that bleak place, called <HI>Porto Sonto,</HI> and <HI>Madera;</HI> the twentieth being becalmed under <HI>Madera,</HI> wee de&s;cried the Pyke of <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Palma</HI> and <HI>Gomera,</HI> twelve Leagues Ea&s;tward
<PB N="46" REF="27"><HI>Palma,</HI> and eight We&s;tward from <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> and the twenty third, notwith&s;tanding the cro&s;s-winds, wee doubled the I&s;le <HI>Ferro</HI> by going &s;omething Ea&s;tward, the wind continuing there for the mo&s;t part North Ea&s;t; and South Ea&s;t.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The Merchandize and commodities of <HI>Guinney.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEfore the <HI>Pertugez</HI> came thither, they had very little or no Merchandize to traffick withall, only they had plenty of whatever is needfull for mans &s;u&s;te|nance; in the former time they brought their Gold unto the <HI>Portugez,</HI> but the People dwelling further within land, dur&s;t not venture to trade with them, or any other <HI>White-men,</HI> and men apparrelled, therefore they do now bring their Gold to the Sea &s;ide; thus,</P>
<P>Betimes in the morning, they come a board our Ships with their Canoes or Scuts, betimes in the morn|ing I &s;ay, for that in the morning the wind which they call <HI>Bofone,</HI> bloweth off from the Land, and then it is calm &s;mooth water; for about noon, the wind which they call <HI>Agem-Bretton</HI> begins to blow out of the Sea, and then they row to Land again; the people that
<PB N="57" REF="32">dwell within the Land not brooking the Sea, for when they are aboard they can &s;carce go or &s;tand, but lye down &amp; &s;pue like Dogs, and are very Sea-&s;ick; but their Rowers or Pilots that carry them are hardy enough, and rarely are &s;ick, by rea&s;on of their dayly u&s;ing to the Seas: But &s;ome of their Merchants, when they come aboard our Ships, are &s;o &s;ick that they ca&s;t out all that are within their bodies; and by rea&s;on of their being &s;o &s;ick in fair weather, they are &s;o afraid of the wind (when the Waves go any thing high) that they make as much ha&s;te home as they can, and &s;ome of them dare not venture upon the Seas to go aboard the Ships, but deliver the mony to the Pilots or Factors, telling them what Merchandize they de&s;ire to have, and tho&s;e <HI>Tolken</HI> come with the Gold aboard the Ships, having a Pur&s;e which hangeth about their mid|dles, wherein they put their Gold, and every &s;everal mans Gold is in a peece of cloath or paper by it &s;elf, and they can tell which is every mans, and what Wares hee de&s;ireth for it; and &s;ometimes they de&s;ire to have mens Gold to be&s;tow, which is called an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of Gold, and of &s;ome two, or three, or more; and when any of their mony is not weight, then they put it into their Pur&s;e, and carry it to the man again, for if they &s;hould put any thing to it to make it full weight, the Merchant would not give it them again; for they weigh their Gold fir&s;t upon the Land, and know how much it is before they &s;end it aboard the Ship, for they credit not one the other; and when they have be&s;tow|ed their mony, then wee mu&s;t give them &s;omething to boot, which they call <HI>Dache.</HI></P>
<P>When we began to Traffick here in the Country with two or three Ships, as one of <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> one
<PB N="58" REF="33">of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and one of <HI>Schiedam,</HI> and that all our Ships met and lay at Anchor together to &s;ell our Wares, the one Ship &s;eeing that the other Trafficked more, and vended more Wares than his fellows; to finde the means to get the Merchants aboard their Ships, they willed the Pilots (with whom they mu&s;t hold friend&s;hip, for they carry the Merchants aboard) to bring them aboard their Ships, and they would give them &s;omething for their labours; and the Pilots accordingly to get &s;omething, brought them aboard that Ship, which had made them that offer (for they are very covetous) which the other Ships perceiv|ing, willed the Pilots to bring the Merchants aboard their Ships, and they would likewi&s;e give them &s;ome|thing; and they made them an&s;wer, that if they would give them as much as the other did, they would come aboard their Ships, which they promi&s;ed to do, and gave them more <HI>Dache</HI> than the other, and by that means drive the Merchants, Pilots, and <HI>Tolken</HI> a|board their Ships, which the other Ships &s;eeing, and thinking that their Merchants Wares co&s;t, them no more than the others, gave them more <HI>Dache</HI> than the others, and by that means &s;triving one with the other, they dimini&s;hed one the others gain; and in fine, their gifts grew to &s;uch a rate, that at this day, their <HI>Dache</HI> amounteth unto &s;ix or &s;even <HI>per Centum.</HI></P>
<P>And now it is come to pa&s;s, that whereas the Coun|try People and Merchants were wont to pay the Li|tridge and Brokeridge, to the Pilots and <HI>Tolken</HI> to carry them aboard their Ships, they &s;ought to the Mer|chants and Country <HI>Moores,</HI> to get them into their Ca|noes for greedine&s;s of <HI>Dache,</HI> which they got of the Factors for their labours, to bring the Merchants a|board,
<PB N="59" REF="33">and thereby in&s;tead of paying them for going aboard, they give the merchants much <HI>Dache,</HI> inre|gard of the great profit they get thereby.</P>
<P>Many Merchants coming to the Sea-&s;ide to buy Wares, &s;ome of them a hundred or two hundred miles from within the Land, bringing great &s;tore of Gold, and have diver&s;e &s;laves with them, which they lade with the Wares which they buy in the Ships, whereof &s;ome have twenty, other thirty, and &s;ome more, as they have means, and according to the trade that they u&s;e; which Merchants or <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Country people, know the hou&s;es or lodgings where they u&s;e to lye, and weigh their mony to their <HI>Tolk</HI> or <HI>Ho&s;t,</HI> and tell them what Goods or Wares they will have, who com|ing aboard, commonly bring one of the Merchants with them (for they tru&s;t not one the other) and leave the re&s;t with their &s;laves upon the Land, which tell them what Wares they de&s;ire to have; and if it bee a Merchant that can &s;peak no <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;peech, they will pre&s;ently tell you, and will the Factor to &s;peak <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> &s;peech unto them, becau&s;e their Merchant is one that dwells within the Land; thereby giving you to under&s;tand, that they mean to deceive and beguile him of much mony. The poor Merchant being &s;ick, and lying in the Ship &s;puing like a Dog, in the mean time the Brokers make the match for them, telling the Factors how much Ware they de&s;ire to have for &s;o much Gold, for that the Wares are commonly &s;old all at one price. The <HI>Tolken</HI> makes not many words with the Factors, but certain Wares before the Mer|chant, as little as they can to content him for his mo|ny; and the price being made with him, hee weighs their Gold, and takes the Wares, and goes on Land a|gain;
<PB N="60" REF="34">and the Merchant being gone home, then the Pilots and <HI>Tolken</HI> come aboard the Ships again, to fetch that which they have cozened the Merchants of; So that oftentimes the Merchants are deceived of a third part of their Goods by &s;uch practices; others, whiles hee looks about, or turns to &s;pue, &s;teals a peece of the Merchants Gold, and puts it into their Mouths, Ears and No&s;trils, making the Merchant beleeve that his mony is two light; the Merchant for his part, &s;ee|ing that by means of their theevery his mony will not hold out, becau&s;e it is too light, that it may weigh more then it is, blows into the Ballance, which the Factors oftentimes not perceiving, and thinking that they have their full weight, are by that means deceiv|ed, and come &s;hort of their reckoning; &s;o that they have a thou&s;and devices to &s;teal, and to beguile the Merchants. At fir&s;t they were wont to bee very &s;im|ple in their dealing, and tru&s;ted the <HI>Netherlands</HI> very much, whereat we wondred; for they were of opini|on, that White men were Gods, and would not de|ceive them, and then took the Wares upon their words, without reckoning it after them, whereby they were deceived; &s;o that if they bought ten fathom of Linnen-Cloath, they found but eight, and by that means lo&s;t two fathom, and other things after that rate, which the Factors did &s;o gro&s;ly, that the Mer|chants at la&s;t perceived it, and looked better to them|&s;elves, and grew &s;o &s;ubtil in their reckoning, that if they bought one hundred fathom of Linnen, they could reckon it to a fathom, and tell whether they had their mea&s;ure or not, &s;o that now if you do them any wrong by mea&s;uring, they will not come aboard your Ship any more; and which is more, for any bad
<PB N="61" REF="34">look, or ha&s;ty word that you &s;hall give them, they will never bee friends with you again.</P>
<P>The next Commodity to their Gold, is their Ele|phants Teeth, and their Ivory. The Elephants they take thus: Where they know they u&s;e oftne&s;t, they digge large and deep pits, which they cover over with &s;traw, and foul leaves of Trees, which the Elephant knowing nothing of, goeth the way hee was wont, and falls in, which the <HI>Negroes</HI> ob&s;erving, run upon him with their <HI>A&s;&s;agacies,</HI> and divide him in peeces among them&s;elves, re&s;erving the Hide for &s;tooles; be&s;towing the tayl on the King, to beat the Flies from his naked body; and &s;elling the Tooth in the Market.</P>
<P>Next the Elephant comes the Monkeys, &s;ome with white beards and black mu&s;tachoes, called by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> beard-men; &s;ome with nothing white but their no&s;es, &s;ome called <HI>Boertkens,</HI> that cannot live a whole day in the &s;ight of a man; the fir&s;t of the&s;e are in very great e&s;teem with their women, and may bee &s;o with our Ladies, there being no kinder creatures un|der the Sun.</P>
<P>After the Monkeys, they offer us Musk-cats, called by the <HI>Portugez, Cato degalia,</HI> which eat Fle&s;h (as <HI>Hens, Pidgeons</HI>) and are &s;o &s;weet, that they ea&s;e them&s;elves in a place apart, leaving the Ordure, and never lying in it, being taken up young in the Woods, with &s;prigs which hang on the Trees, they are brought up, and the Musk is taken from them and put in Gla&s;&s;es, the male Cats yeelding the be&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>Agalia,</HI> by rea&s;on the females pi&s;s in the Cod wherein the Musk groweth, and pi&s;s it out with their water; When the Natives perceive that, they tear their bag, and take their <HI>Aga|lia</HI> from them; for they do &s;o to be rid of it: The
<PB N="62" REF="35">wilder and wor&s;e they are to rule, &s;o much the co&s;tlier and richer their <HI>Agalia.</HI></P>
<P>Neither are their Birds a viler Commodity than their Bea&s;ts, for fir&s;t there are blew Parrots, which be|ing taken out of their Ne&s;ts, are tamed and made &s;o teachable, that they out-prate the Green <HI>Bra&s;ilian</HI> Parrots. Secondly, Thereis a bigger Green Bird, like the Catalinkin of <HI>We&s;t-India,</HI> called Au&s;uront, or Parokite, taken with Nets, as wee do Sparrows, u|&s;ing much the Low corn grounds, and being &s;o kinde the one to the other, that put the male and female in a Cage, they &s;it &s;o quietly and re&s;pectfully, the <HI>Hee</HI> on the right hand, and the <HI>Shee</HI> on the left, as may teach many a man civility and duty.</P>
<P>To which I may add another kinde of Parokiton, Red &s;potted, with a black tail, which would entertain us with very great delight, though the Natives make no more of them than eat them alive, feathers, bones, and all. But to come to what is more u&s;eful, wee have their Cotton yarns, Hides, and what they &s;ell at the deare&s;t rate; Slaves and Children, which the Parents will trappan to the Sea &s;ide, and &s;ell away for a Crown.</P>
<P>It al&s;o yeeldeth good <HI>Trennuelis,</HI> like milk (when the Tree is cut down) which cometh out of the body thereof, having hanged three or four daies they are through ripe, the Tree bears but one bunch at a time, whereon there is at lea&s;t a hundred Figs, or more, and when they cut off the bunch of Figs, the Tree al&s;o is cut down to the ground, the root &s;taying &s;till in the earth, which pre&s;ently &s;pringeth up again, and within a month hath its full growth, and &s;o all the year long, no time excepted. The tree beareth fruit very deli|cate
<PB N="63" REF="35">to eat; you mu&s;t pull off the husk wherein the fruit lyeth, very delightfull to behold, the colour whereof is whiti&s;h and &s;omewhat yellow; when you bite it, it is &s;oft as if it were Meal and Butter mixed together; it is mellow in biting, it cooleth the Maw; much thereof eaten, maketh a man very loo&s;e and raw in the throat, it maketh women leacherous if they eat any &s;tore.

<P>The Bachonens (by us &s;o called) are very like the Bannanaes, for the condition and form is all one, only that the fruit is &s;maller, &s;horter, white of colour within, and &s;weeter of ta&s;te, and is e&s;teemed whole|&s;omer to bee eaten than the Bannanaes; but there is no &s;uch great quantity of them, and for that they were fir&s;t brought out of the Kingdome of <HI>Congo</HI> into other Countries, they have gotten the name thereof.</P>

<P>There are great &s;tore of Iniamus growing in <HI>Guin|ney</HI> in great fields, which are &s;owed and planted like Turneps; the Root is Iniamus, and groweth in the Earth like Earth-nuts; tho&s;e Iniams are as great as a Yellow-root, but thicker and fuller of knots, they are of a Mou&s;e-colour, and within as white as a Tur|nep, but not &s;o &s;weet; being put in a Kettle and &s;od|den with fle&s;h, and then peeled and eaten with Oyl and Pepper, they are a very delicate meat; in many places it is u&s;ed for bread, and is the greate&s;t meat that the <HI>Negroes</HI> eat.</P>

<P>The Palm-wine tree is almo&s;t like the Cocos-Tree, or a Lantor, with diver&s;e others, and are of three or four &s;orts, mo&s;t of them have all one kinde of leaf, but in manner of Wood they are all unlike, for this Tree is &s;horter of Wood then all the re&s;t; The Wine is drawn out of tho&s;e Trees by boring them, from whence there i&s;&s;ueth a Sap like Milk, which is very cool and fre&s;h to drink; at the fir&s;t when it is drawn, it is plea&s;ant and &s;weet, having &s;tood a while it is as &s;ower as Vinegar, &s;o that you may u&s;e it in a Sallet, but be|ing drunk &s;weet and fre&s;h, it cau&s;eth a man to void Urine well, whereby in tho&s;e Countries, there are very few found that have the di&s;ea&s;e of the Stone; by drinking much thereof a mans head will &s;oon bee light; but that lightne&s;s a man hath in his head thereby, cau&s;eth it not to ake: When it cometh fir&s;t out of the Tree, it is &s;weeter of ta&s;te, than when it hath &s;tood a while, but yet it is e&s;teemed better when it hath &s;tood a while, and is &s;omewhat &s;ettled, than pre&s;ently to bee drunk; for it &s;tandeth &s;eething and bubling, as if it hung over the fire and &s;od, &s;o that if it were put into a Gla&s;s and &s;topt up, without letting any air come in|to it, the force thereof would break the Gla&s;s in peeces; but being a meal-tide old it is nothing worth, becau&s;e it is &s;o &s;owre, and then it is of another colour very wateri&s;h, therefore it is much mixed with water, and &s;eldome comes pure into the Market, as it is taken out of the Tree, which is done partly to increa&s;e their Wine, as al&s;o that then it is the &s;weeter to drink, and
<PB N="66" REF="37">hath the ta&s;te of Syder, and the colour of Mu&s;t; when the Tree is old and will yeild no more wine at the top, it is cut down at the foot, and a fire made at the root thereof, where they &s;et a pot, whereinto the Wine (by rea&s;on of the heat) runneth; the Tree being chan|ged, and yeilding no more profit, there groweth ano|ther Tree out of the root thereof, but it is half a year old before it giveth any Wine, in the morning betimes an hour before day, the Wine is drawn out, and brought to the Market at noon-time.</P>
<P>The Palmitas-Tree is not much to bee &s;een in <HI>Guin|ney,</HI> but for that a <HI>Negro</HI> in that Country &s;hewed mee the fruit thereof, I thought good to &s;ay &s;omething of it in this place; It is a Tree without branches, on the top of the Tree the fruit groweth, and it is almo&s;t like the Annanas when it is ripe: It is outwardly of a fair Gold-colour, and withering it hath grains, like Pomgranates, they are of a very &s;weet ta&s;te, the o|ther is hard and unfit to eat.</P>
<P>But what is &s;tranger than all this, here is a Tree cal|led the Oy&s;ter-Tree, that bears Oy&s;ters three times in the year; but I beleeve it hath been &s;ince <HI>Noah</HI>'s flood when
