<HEAD>CORINTH, by the <HI>Turks</HI> GO&V;RDESE,</HEAD>
<P>Is an Ancient City which &s;tands on a Ri&s;ing Ground, about Two Miles from the Sea of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> The Hou&s;es are much &s;cattered, having many Fields among&s;t them, together with which they take up above three Miles in compa&s;s. There are many plea&s;ant Gardens with all &s;orts of Fruits. The Hou&s;es here are more for Trade and Plea&s;ure than Security, mo&s;t having other Hou&s;es up in the Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands upon a Hill. To this they retreat when any Pyrats come to annoy them, which is often in the Summer time; they coming with their <HI>Briganteens,</HI> to the <HI>I&s;th|mus,</HI> which is not above &s;ix Miles off. The Hill on which the Ca&s;tle &s;tands is very high, it was formerly called the <HI>Acro Corinthus,</HI> and is very &s;teep round a|bout; the part towards the We&s;t, North and North
<PB N="2" REF="3">Ea&s;t being almo&s;t Perpendicular. It is above two Miles from the Town to the Ca&s;tle. The way up is much winding, and al&s;o &s;teep. The Hill is all Stone. The For|tifications are very Ancient. There are two Walls before you pa&s;s into the chiefe&s;t part of the Ca&s;tle. The Hill is Walled round at the Top, which is above three Miles. There are &s;ome Guns which are of no other u&s;e than to Salute any Great Per&s;on, or to fire on their Fe&s;ti|vals. From the Northermo&s;t part is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pects the World affords, looking into the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto, Aegean</HI> Sea, and &s;everal Mountains at great di&s;tance, together with tho&s;e mo&s;t plea&s;ant Plains of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ilico,</HI> which abound with Olive-trees, Vine-yards, and many &s;mall Vil|lages. In the Ca&s;tle the Land is good, where are many Pa&s;ture Fields, and plenty of Water, &s;o as it may endure a long Siege; to the We&s;t there is a Spring which gu&s;heth out from the Top of the Hill, and fall|eth down above Fifty Fathome.

It is but a &s;mall Town without any Fortifications. The Plain about it affords Corn, Currants, and Wine, Olive-trees there are not many, it lying too open to the Norther|ly Winds, which bring very cold Bla&s;ts from the Mountains on the other &s;ide the Gulph. The Moun|tains to the South, are not above Five Miles from the Town, which are very high, and continue to the Plains of <HI>Ba&s;ilico,</HI> betwixt which and the Sea is the Road to <HI>Corinth,</HI> which is very bad way to pa&s;s in the Winter, there being no cut Rivers, and the Floods over|flowing
<PB N="3" REF="3">make &s;everal Waters, &s;ome above a Mile broad. There are no Inhabitants between the Plain of <HI>Ba&s;ilico</HI> and this Place, nor is the Soil good, being mo&s;t Stony, and having many Woods, nor is it above two Miles from the Sea to the Mountains in mo&s;t places.

<HEAD>PARTRASS, formerly called PATRA,</HEAD>
<P>Is an Ancient City. It &s;tands about Nine Miles without the Ca&s;tles, at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Le|panto,</HI> on a Hill about a Quarter of a Mile from the Sea. The greate&s;t part of the Town runs down to|wards the South Ea&s;t, overlooking the Plain. The Hou&s;es are thick, and are above two Miles about, in|cluding the Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands to the North above the Town. The Ca&s;tle is well built, having very high Walls, to the Ea&s;tward is a dry Ditch with a low Wall; towards the Sea is a round Tower well built, high and &s;trong, which has Six very long Guns to com|mand the Road, but they lye too high to do any harm to Ships, except a Shot &s;hould chance to hit any of the Ma&s;ts. There are many Ruines about the City. To the Ea&s;tward is a very great Mountain, the Foot of which is about ten Miles from the Town. The Plain is very delight&s;ome, having many plea&s;ant Gardens with all &s;orts of Fruits. The large&s;t, and be&s;t Le|mons are here of any place in the <HI>Morea:</HI> At the Sea &s;ide there are only a few Store-hou&s;es. About a Quar|ter of a Mile from them to the South, are the Ruines of a Great Church which was Dedicated to St. <HI>Andrew.</HI> There are no Fortifications by the Sea-&s;ide nearer than the Ca&s;tles at the Gulph. In the Summer time there is a continual Watch by the Sea-&s;ide, of both Hor&s;e and Foot; the Town dividing into &s;everal Parties, one
<PB N="4" REF="4">Party goes down every night &s;couting along the Marine, not &s;uffering any Boats to come a &s;hore till it be Day. Before this place was the great fight betwixt the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> 1571. when the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were Victorious.</P>

<HEAD>GASTON, formerly called ELIS,</HEAD>
<P>Stands in a very large Plain about Eight Miles from the Bay of <HI>Chiarenza.</HI> The Hou&s;es are very much &s;catter'd; without Walls or any Fortification. The greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants are Husbandmen. The Country about it is very plea&s;ant. There are &s;everal large Woods about it. The Land is mo&s;t Plow'd, and Pa&s;ture Land, having very few Olive or Fruit trees. In the time of War with the <HI>Ve|netians,</HI> here is u&s;ually a <HI>Ba&s;&s;ha</HI> with a Number of Hor&s;e. who guard the Coa&s;t. There is no Fortification by the Sea-&s;ide from the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto</HI> to <HI>Navareene,</HI> ex|cept the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arcadia</HI> a Mile from the Sea. From <HI>Partra&s;s</HI> to <HI>Ga&s;ton</HI> the way is plain, and &s;o continues to <HI>Navardene</HI> a long the Sea &s;ide.

The Ca&s;tle is well built, having the Walls very high, but much out of repair. It has no Ditch about it, nor has it any other Strength than from the Scituation, not having above twenty Guns. Under the Walls is a &s;mall Town where Sir <HI>Henry Hide</HI> (who was &s;ometime Con&s;ul for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in the <HI>Morea</HI>) lived in great State, built a &s;mall Church, and a fair Hou&s;e with many Gardens and Vine-yards
<PB N="5" REF="4">about it. The Church remains entire. The Scituation is very plea&s;ant, and was by the <HI>Venetians</HI> called <HI>Bel videre.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARCADIA, formerly called CYPARISSA,</HEAD>
<P>Stands in a Great Bay about a Mile from the Sea. The Ca&s;tle and Town &s;tand on &s;cragged Rocks, under high Mountains.

<HEAD>NAVAREENE, formerly called PYL&V;S,</HEAD>

It has about Forty Guns, which are mo&s;t towards the Sea. The Land to the South Ea&s;t lies high. To the we&s;t end of the Harbour &s;tands Old <HI>Navareene</HI> (formerly called <HI>Pylus</HI>) on a high Hill very &s;teep; the Walls are very much out of repair, great part
<PB N="6" REF="5">being fallen down, there are very few Inhabitants in it. It might be made impregnable, no hills being near it. I cannot &s;ay whether they have any Guns in it. This place in other Maps is put down above 20 Miles from the Sea, and the I&s;land of <HI>Spactoria</HI> (which makes the Harbour) left out.</P>

<HEAD>MODON,</HEAD>
<P>Is a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle which &s;tands on a low Point of Land. The Sea wa&s;heth the Foundations of the Walls above three Quarters round: the Walls are very high. The Port is to the Ea&s;tward, it hath a &s;mall Mole to con|tain two or three Gallies; the Port is not &s;ecure for Ships, South We&s;t Winds having too great Power here. To the South lies the I&s;land of <HI>Sapienza</HI> about two Miles from the Point of the Ca&s;tle. To command the Pa&s;&s;age a round Tower is built, which hath &s;everal great Guns, that lye equal with the Water. Towards the Land by the Port is a dry Ditch five Yards deep, and about twenty Yards broad, between which and the main Ca&s;tle is a very &s;trong Battery of a|bout ten Guns. There is a dry Ditch, and Draw-bridges to pa&s;s into the Body of the Ca&s;tle. To the North We&s;t is another Battery to &s;ecure that Mount, where are very good Guns. On the Walls towards the Port are three Towers, in each of which are &s;mall Guns: in all, they &s;ay, here are about One hundred Guns. The Town &s;tands about half a Mile from the Ca&s;tle, being inhabited by <HI>Greeks.</HI> In the Port is a &s;mall I&s;land on which a Battery might be rai&s;ed and do much harm to the Ca&s;tle, it being as high as the Walls. The Ca&s;tle is above a Mile about.</P>

<HEAD>CORON,</HEAD>

The Fortification is in much better repair than at <HI>Modon.</HI> Towards the Land the Walls are above Forty Foot high, and here is a round Tower above Six|ty Foot high, in which are &s;everal very good Guns to an&s;wer the Land, which runs higher than the Walls. At the Southward part of the Ca&s;tle the Land goes &s;loping down towards the Sea &s;ide, from the Walls of the Ca&s;tle, the ground is not Rocky in that part. There are about &s;eventy good Guns about the Wall, and &s;everal of the Works are Arch'd over. To the North is a round Tower which &s;tands low to command the Road. Here is no Harbour for Gallies, nor is the Road very &s;ecure. It had formerly a good Mole which is now &s;unk; which, with other Ruines has &s;o choak'd up the harbour, that mo&s;t buoy up their Cables with Cask to keep them from ground.</P>

<HEAD>CALAMATA, formerly called TH&V;RI&V;M,</HEAD>

To the We&s;t is a very large and fertile Plain, in which are many <HI>Greek</HI> Villages, and two &s;mall Towns, the one called <HI>Cochiuk Magna,</HI> the other <HI>Ni&s;cia.</HI> The latter is mo&s;t &s;mall I&s;lands, which little Rivers make.

<HEAD>MESITHA, formerly called LACEDEMON,</HEAD>
<P>Is &s;cituated at the &s;ide of a large Plain on a ri&s;ing Ground, about twenty five Miles from the Sea &s;ide, having very high Mountains all to the We&s;t of the Plain. The Ca&s;tle &s;tands to the We&s;t on a very high Hill, &s;teep on the We&s;t, and South part, where it is inac|ce&s;&s;able, but &s;loping to the North, having two old Walls which cro&s;s the Hill from the North to the South, di|viding the Hill almo&s;t into three Parts. The way into the Ca&s;tle is very difficult. The Walls of the Ca&s;tle are well built, but very old. It is near half a Mile about, having two Gates to be pa&s;s'd. The Town is large, and is e&s;teemed the &s;econd for bigne&s;s in all the <HI>Morea,</HI> yet <HI>Patra&s;s</HI> hath more hou&s;es. The Ruines about it are very great, and towards the South they reach above four Miles, having in &s;ome places the Foundation of a thick Wall, which they &s;ay was the Walls of <HI>Sparta.</HI> To the North about a Quarter of a Mile from the Town, is a great and high Building, which they &s;ay was an Arch of an Aquaeduct. The Plain is very plea&s;ant, full of &s;mall Villages, Olive, and Mulberry trees. This Place and <HI>Calamata</HI> make more Silk than all the other parts of the <HI>Morea.</HI> The River which runs through the Plain is now called <HI>Va&s;ili Pottamo.</HI> In Winter it &s;preads very large, but in Summer towards the City is almo&s;t dry. Tho' the City &s;tands remote from the Sea, and free from dangers that en&s;ue from thence; yet the <HI>Manjotts</HI> are a People apt to prey upon them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="location">
<HEAD>MAINA, which &s;ome write BRAZZO di MAINA,</HEAD>
<P>Is that Country where the <HI>Manjotts</HI> inhabit. It lies We&s;t of the Plain of <HI>Mi&s;itha,</HI> and &s;o runs down to the Sea, being Mountanous and full of Woods, and very
<PB N="9" REF="6">difficult to come at, either by Sea, or Land. In the Year 1667, they rebelled and &s;ent to the <HI>Venetians</HI> and <HI>Mal|te&s;es</HI> who came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bringing with them Powder, and other Ammunition. Many Parties of them would often make Incur&s;ions into the <HI>Turks</HI> Do|minions, and did much harm. But the Captain <HI>Ba&s;&s;ha,</HI> who went with Forty Gallies, to relieve a Ca&s;tle called <HI>Zarnata,</HI> reduced them to their former Obedience. Articles were drawn up, in which the <HI>Manjotts</HI> con|&s;ented to pay a &s;mall Tribute. Yet do they continue to crui&s;e about with their <HI>Briganteens.</HI> If they take any <HI>Turks,</HI> they &s;ell them to the <HI>Malte&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Legor|ne&s;es,</HI> as they do the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to the <HI>Turks.</HI> If any Ship come to Anchor on their Coa&s;t, many arm them|&s;elves and go to the place, over again&s;t where the Ship doth ride; &s;ome of them will be in Prie&s;ts Habits, walk|ing by the Sea &s;ide, with their Wallets, in which they will have &s;ome Wine and Bread. Their Companions lye hid behind the Bu&s;hes at &s;ome convenient Po&s;t. When any &s;trangers come a&s;hore, who do not under|&s;tand their Language, the feigned Prie&s;ts make &s;igns to them, &s;hewing them their Bread and Wine, which they offer to them for money, by which the &s;trangers being enticed from the Sea fide (and it may be to &s;it down and ta&s;t their Wine) the hidden <HI>Manjotts</HI> come and make their Prey. The Prie&s;ts will &s;eem to be &s;orry, and endeavour to make the &s;trangers believe they were altogether ignorant of any &s;uch de&s;ign. So a white Flagg is put out, and a Treaty held with the Ship for their Ran&s;ome. The Prie&s;ts endeavour to moderate the Price, &s;hewing a great deal of re&s;pect to their Com|panions, who are cloathed in <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habits. Many Ships have been thus &s;erved. Such a bu&s;ine&s;s happen|ed to &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, who (having the Winds con|trary) came to Anchor near the I&s;land <HI>Cervi,</HI> (in one of which Sir <HI>Paul Rycaut</HI> was a Pa&s;&s;enger going for
<PB N="10" REF="7"><HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI>) &s;everal Young Men were taken, and they paid dear for vi&s;iting the <HI>Manjotts,</HI> and though the Earl of <HI>Winchil&s;ea,</HI> (then Emba&s;&s;adour (from his Maje&s;ty) at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>) made complaint of it, no redre&s;s could be had. In the Plains are many Olive Trees, and Vine-yards: In the Woods there are many wild Vines. There are great quantities of Quailes, &s;o as they Salt them up, and &s;end them to &s;everal other parts. Powder and Shot is here &s;carce, but they do &s;o well manage the Sling, as is to admiration, with which they kill Birds on the Wing. The Sea Ports in <HI>Maina,</HI> are, <HI>Chetri, Vitulo, Porto Quaglio, Yaracaria, Pagana, Rapana,</HI> with &s;everal other &s;mall Ports and Creeks, where they &s;hel|ter them&s;elves when they are pur&s;ued.

<PB N="12" REF="8">Province of <HI>Arcadia.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Mora Orta,</HI> that is, the Center or Middle of the <HI>Morea.</HI> Here are very rich <HI>Turks,</HI> who have their Wealth in Land and Cattle; mo&s;t being Graziers and Husbandmen. This is the only place which de&s;erves the Name of a Town in the whole Province. The Great <HI>Moske</HI> was former|ly a Heathen Temple. The Hou&s;es are very mean: The <HI>Turks</HI> live mo&s;t in their Farms, which they call Cheftlicks, not being in danger of Pyrats. The Province of <HI>Arcadia</HI> is all &s;urrounded with Mountains, mo&s;t of which are covered with Woods. Yearly they burn the Gra&s;s and Bryers to clear the ground again&s;t the Spring, then very good Pa&s;ture grows up in its &s;tead. There hath been many Villages, &s;ome have been Cities, but now the <HI>Albane&s;es,</HI> (who are the Shep|herds, and three times the Number, as the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> which are in the&s;e parts) live mo&s;t in Tents, re|moving their Tents and Herds according to the &s;ea&s;on of the Year. In the Summer time they are up in the Mountains, and in the Winter they are in the Woods by the Sea &s;ide, being more or le&s;s Tents together. There are a &s;ort of the&s;e <HI>Albane&s;es</HI> which have a great Village called <HI>Syleman,</HI> as the Mountains have the &s;ame Name. The&s;e <HI>Albane&s;es</HI> have often Rebelled and kept them&s;elves up in the Mountains, doing much mi&s;chief by Robbery. They were &s;o &s;trong in the Year 1679, as the <HI>Ba&s;sha</HI> went with 500 Men to reduce them by granting a General Pardon.</P>

It is &s;cituated on the &s;ide of a high and &s;teep Hill, having &s;ix Walls from the Water-&s;ide to the Ca&s;tle, which cro&s;s the Hill, all
<PB N="13" REF="8">which and the Ca&s;tle are furrounded with a high Wall, which runs up at each &s;ide of the City. The Hou&s;es &s;tand &s;cattering between the&s;e &s;everal Walls, but the great|e&s;t part are by the Sea-&s;ide. The Ca&s;tle &s;tands on the top of the Hill. It is kept in very good repair. There are about twenty very good Guns. The Port is almo&s;t Oval, having a very narrow Entrance. There is a Chain which pa&s;&s;es from one &s;ide to the other. At each &s;ide of the Entrance are places for many Guns, tho' now they have not above three or four. The City is well Peopled being a Ne&s;t of Pyrats. It yielded to the <HI>Turk</HI> in the Year 1499, after a long Siege before. The <HI>Turks</HI> having the Ca&s;tles at the Entrance into the Gulph, the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had no hopes of Relief, &s;o were forced to yield them&s;elves up to their Mercy, who gave them free leave to depart. In the time of War with the <HI>Venetians</HI> the <HI>Briganteens</HI> of this place were a continual Plague to the People of <HI>Zant,</HI> and <HI>Ceffalonia.</HI> A Famous Cor&s;are of this place called <HI>Du|rach Beigh,</HI> went with Eleven <HI>Briganteens</HI> and in the Night time Landed at <HI>Cherri,</HI> on the South part of the I&s;land of <HI>Zant,</HI> taking away above 200 Slaves, and at Day break appeared before the Port of <HI>Zant</HI> with Colours flying, and firing his Guns, gave them notice of his Prize, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they had the News by Land; &s;o got &s;afe to his Port with this great Succe&s;s. The day before was a &s;olemn Fea&s;t kept at <HI>Cherri,</HI> and many People came from the City of <HI>Zant</HI> to pay their Devotions to the <HI>Panaija</HI> there. Since the Peace with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> they go upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Apuglia,</HI> and take poor Countrey-men, bringing them to mi&s;erable Slavery. The City of <HI>Lepanto</HI> hath the whole trade of the Gulph, here being the Cu&s;tomer who takes his Duties on all Boats that go in or out. The plains are very plea&s;ant, at each &s;ide of the City, with many Olive-trees, and Vine-yards. To the Ea&s;t|ward
<PB N="14" REF="9">of the City about a quarter of a Mile out of Town, there is a great Spring which gu&s;heth out of a Rock at the Foot of a high Mountain; it divides into &s;everal Streams which makes &s;ome I&s;lands, the&s;e I&s;lands are mo&s;t cut &s;quare, which are covered by va&s;t high Plane-trees, that &s;tand very thick, and &s;o, as at Noon-day it is &s;hady all about the Spring. In the Sum|mer time here are continually many <HI>Turks,</HI> bringing their Victuals with them, and tarry mo&s;t part of the day. About Fifteen Miles from hence, upon the &s;ame &s;ide of the Gulph, &s;tands a &s;mall Village called <HI>Vitre|nizza,</HI> near unto which Sir <HI>Giles Ea&s;tcourt</HI> was Buried, travelling in Company with Mr. <HI>Francis Vernon;</HI> and in his way towards Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> Sir <HI>Giles</HI> com|plained in the Morning, but would not be per&s;waded to tarry at <HI>Lepanto,</HI> hoping it would pa&s;s: he called to his man to help him down, and in le&s;s then half an hour he Dyed, and was Buried with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Greek</HI> Prie&s;ts, who live in <HI>Vitrenizza.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Ca&s;tle at the Entrance of the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto:</HI> One is on the <HI>Morea</HI> &s;hore, the other on <HI>Rumili;</HI> the Enterance between them is not above a Mile and a half, nor can any Ship pa&s;s without danger of being &s;unk, there being &s;everal Guns in each Ca&s;tle which lye level with the Water.

<HEAD>NATALICO,</HEAD>
<P>Is a large Town &s;tanding in a Bay, which hath lying before it, two I&s;lands that keep off the main force of the Sea. From the Ea&s;tern part at the Entrance of the Bay up to the Town, is a <HI>Pe&s;caria</HI> or Fi&s;hery, it being very &s;hallow, and the bottom muddy, with Weeds; but that part to the Northward of the Town is very deep. No Boats of any Burthen can come within a
<PB N="15" REF="9">Mile of the Town, nor into that part above it. They have abundance of Monoxylos, or Cannows, which pa&s;s through narrow Channels; with the&s;e they carry all their Goods to, and from the Town. The Inhabi|tants are <HI>Greeks,</HI> no <HI>Turks</HI> living with them, except &s;ome of the Cu&s;tomers Officers, the Cu&s;tomer him&s;elf living at <HI>Mezzalnnzi,</HI> a place about ten Miles di&s;tant, upon the &s;ide of this Bay. Both the&s;e Towns are well Peopled: Neither of them have any Fortification; no Enemy can come by Water to annoy them. On the Ea&s;termo&s;t I&s;land is a &s;mall Chappel called St. <HI>So&s;ti,</HI> again&s;t which Ships do Anchor when they come to load.

<P>THE Inhabitants of the <HI>Morea,</HI> are <HI>Turks, Greeks, Albane&s;es</HI> and <HI>T'Zackonians.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> for the mo&s;t part live in, or under the Command of Ca&s;tles, and at their Farms in the Country (where they &s;ome|times are;) they have Towers built about Thirty Foot high, the Door of which is about ten Foot from the ground; again&s;t which a Wall with Stairs is built, a|bout five Foot from the Tower, to which Wall a Draw-bridge is let down from before the Door where they enter: 'tis every Night drawn up to &s;ecure them from Pirats; &s;ome have only a Ladder, which they take up into the Tower. There is a continual Watch in the Summer time, all along the Sea Coa&s;ts. Of <HI>Turks'</HI> there are not above 30000 Inhabitants; the Chri&s;tians are three times as many. The <HI>Greeks</HI> have free Exerci&s;e of their Religion. Their Prie&s;ts are very ignorant; &s;carce any under&s;tanding the old <HI>Greek;</HI> nor are they &s;o Super&s;titious in their wor&s;hip to Pictures,
<PB N="16" REF="10">as tho&s;e who live under the <HI>Venetians.</HI> They have &s;everal Mona&s;teries. Near unto <HI>Vo&s;tiza</HI> is one, which is called, <HI>La Madona di Spiglia,</HI> it being at the &s;ide of a Mountain in a large Cave, where there is a Church, in which is the Picture of the Virgin <HI>MARY,</HI> which (they &s;ay) was brought hither from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> by Angels at the time when the <HI>Turks</HI> took that City. There was another <HI>Madona</HI> near <HI>Mi&s;ithra,</HI> which did many Mi|racles; and every Year great numbers of <HI>Greeks</HI> flock'd from all parts to pay their Devotions to it. The <HI>Ba&s;&s;ha</HI> of the <HI>Morea</HI> having notice, went to &s;ee the Cere|mony, telling the Prie&s;ts he was de&s;irous to &s;ee &s;ome Miracle; they telling him it had done many, he or|dered one of his Men to bring him another Picture out of any Hou&s;e, which being brought, he asked the Prie&s;ts what difference there was betwixt tho&s;e two Pictures, they an&s;wered, that, that Picture which was in the Church was a mo&s;t Sacred thing. But the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ha</HI> cau&s;ed a Fire to be made, and both Pictures to be put into it, &s;aying, he would Wor&s;hip that which e&s;caped the Fire; but both were burnt, and the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ha</HI> laugh|ing at their Super&s;tition, went his way. The Chri&s;tians live much better here than in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The vulgar <HI>Greek</HI> is the general Language, and there are few <HI>Turks</HI> but can &s;peak it. Every Town hath <HI>Greek</HI> Elders which they call <HI>Yerondo's.:</HI> The&s;e appear upon all Publick Matters, and levy Taxes on the Towns-People, pro|portionably to their Abilities. The <HI>Albane&s;es</HI> are of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church. They generally live not in Towns, yet have &s;everal Villages; one of which is very large, called <HI>Sylemen.</HI> It &s;tands in the Mountains near the City of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> which Mountains have the &s;ame Name. They live mo&s;t in Tents, being for the mo&s;t part Shep|herds. The <HI>T'Zackonians</HI> are mo&s;t in Towns, they are a very poor People, &s;erving as Porters, both Men and Women carrying very great Burthens. There are al&s;o a
<PB N="17" REF="10">great many Jews, who for the mo&s;t part are Mer|chants and Shop-keepers, living but poorly; the <HI>Athe|nian</HI> Merchants &s;upplying mo&s;t of the Country with all &s;orts of Merchandizes, and chiefly from <HI>Venice.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> are very rich in their Cloathing here, their Ve&s;ts being mo&s;t made with fine <HI>Venice</HI> Cloth.</P>
<P>The Merchandizes of the <HI>Morea,</HI> or Product of the Land, are Olive-Oyl, Raw-Silk, Wax, Honey, Soap, Cordovan-skins, Sheep-skins, Butter, Chee&s;e, Rai&s;ons, Currans, Figgs, Wines, Wheat, Barly, Rye, Oates, dry'd Acorns (which the <HI>Venetians</HI> call <HI>Valania,</HI> and which are u&s;ed in <HI>Italy</HI> for Tanning of Leather, as we u&s;e the Bark of the Tree,) Fu&s;tick Wood, and Pernicoke Seed, which Seed is for Dyeing of Scarlet. It grows on a Shurb-Oak-tree, ri&s;ing at the &s;temm of the Leaf, like a Bli&s;ter, &s;omething bigger than a Pea, out of which comes Du&s;t (or Powder) which being dry turns to &s;mall Worms, which when quickned they kill with Wine. The Soyl of the Land is very good. They Plow with two Oxen, and without Wheels, nor are they at the pains to dung the Ground. They have ma|ny Weeds, and the Liquorice Root is very trouble&s;ome being deep. They reap their Corn much in the man|ner as we do, but have no Barns, only Thre&s;hing-floors, (which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Chirman.</HI>) They are on high ground, and open to the Winds. Here they tread it out with Hor&s;es, which are made fa&s;t to a Po&s;t, round which the Corn is put; the Hor&s;es trampling upon it make great di&s;patch: with the Wind they clean&s;e it, and &s;end it home to their Hou&s;es; that which they intend to keep they put into great Earthen Jarrs, and Baskets made with &s;lit Canes, which Baskets are dawb|ed over with wet Cow-dung, which being well dryed, not only keeps in the Corn, but al&s;o pre&s;erves it cool. The <HI>Turks</HI> are u&s;ually at the&s;e places with a Watch, well Armed (if near the Sea) all the time of the Corn
<PB N="18" REF="11">treading. They have great quantity of Gra&s;s, but make no Hay, feeding their Hor&s;es with chopt Straw and Barly; they Litter them with Hor&s;e-dung, which being dryed in the Sun, and &s;haken, falls a&s;under, and is very &s;oft. In the Spring they feed them with green Barly, tying one of their hinder-leggs to a Stake, which they remove twice a day, keeping them to an allow|ance. Be&s;ides the Common Gra&s;s, they have a &s;ort of Clover Gra&s;s, which they give them Green, after their feeding on Barly, bringing it home to their Sta|bles. In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the common Gra&s;s is u&s;ually parcht and dry, which therefore they burn, and new &s;oon &s;prings up in its place.</P>
<P>The Trees in the Woods are &s;everal &s;orts of Oaks, Pine, Firr, wild Che&s;nut and wild Pear.</P>
<P>In their Gardens they have Orange, Lemon, Citron, Pomegranate, Apricock, Peach, Plum, and Cherry-Trees; Apples and Pears they have not many, nor are they &s;o good as u&s;ually they be with us; Cypre&s;s-trees and Wallnuts they are plenty. In the Plains near any Springs, are mo&s;t &s;tately Plane-trees, which are very &s;hady. They have all &s;orts of Garden Herbs as we have, and great quantity of Musk-melons, Water Melons, and &s;everal &s;orts of Gourds.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>December,</HI> they begin to make Oyl, continuing it till the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> or accord|ing as the quantity of Olives is. <HI>February, March,</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> are for making Butter and Chee&s;e, al&s;o for &s;heer|ing their Sheep. <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> is the time for cutting their Corn. In <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> they are imployed in gathering Mulberry Leaves to feed their Silk-worms. <HI>Augu&s;t, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> are for gathering and drying their Currans, Figgs, Rai&s;ons, Valania, Perni|coke Seed, and Tobacco; al&s;o for making their Wine and taking up their Honey and Wax.</P>
<P>Their Oyl they put into great Earthen Jarrs, which
<PB N="19" REF="11">are made of hard Clay, well baked in Furnaces, but not glazed, which therefore will not keep Water from &s;oaking through them. The&s;e Jarrs are &s;ent to <HI>Candy,</HI> and other places for Merchandize. To pre&s;erve their Chee&s;e they &s;ift Earth, mix it with Salt and Water, then with it Coat over the Chee&s;e, which keeps it cool, but makes it very Salt. A great quantity of this Chee&s;e is yearly carried to <HI>Venice:</HI> It &s;erves the ordinary People, who &s;ometimes grate it upon their boyl'd Macaroons, and Rice, in&s;tead of <HI>Parmi&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>Though the <HI>Turks</HI> drink no Wine, yet they take New Wine and boyl it up to a Syrrup (which they call <HI>Bec|mez,</HI> and we call <HI>Cute,</HI>) putting it into &s;mall Jarrs, they drink it mingled with Water, for this they account to be no Wine. They call new Wine <HI>Shira,</HI> and old Wine <HI>Shirab.</HI></P>
<P>Their Buildings are mo&s;t of Bricks made of Clay, and chopt Straw, and dryed in the Sun. The Foun|dations of the Walls are of Stone, and Lime. Few Hou&s;es are above two Story high; they are covered over with Pan Tiles. There are not many great Hou&s;es in all the <HI>Morea,</HI> the be&s;t being at <HI>Napoli, Mi&s;itha,</HI> and <HI>Corinth:</HI> Not above three de&s;erve the Name of <HI>Seraglios</HI> (as they call Palaces.) Fle&s;h and Fowl is plen|tiful, but Fi&s;h is &s;carce. The Air is very temperate; there is &s;eldome any Rain from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> The Winter is al&s;o very moderate, and la&s;teth not above two Months any thing Cold: There is &s;eldome any Snow in the Plains</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of the <HI>CITY</HI> of ATHENS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Head City in the Province of <HI>Attica,</HI> and was once the greate&s;t Mi&s;tre&s;s of Learning in all <HI>Europe.</HI> The Plain is about Sixteen Miles Long, and Five Broad, being &s;urrounded with Mountains, all but towards the South, where it is wa&s;hed by the <HI>Egean</HI> Sea. The Olive-trees &s;tand &s;o thick to the We&s;t of the City that they &s;eem to be a Wood, reaching Six Miles in Length, and Two in Breadth. Whil&s;t I was there, a <HI>Tahrirge</HI> (or Surveyor) came down from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to Survey the Place; he found above Fifty Thou&s;and Olive-trees in this Plain, and other places about the City. There are &s;everal &s;mall Villages, where are very plea&s;ant Gardens, which afford all &s;ort of Fruit and Saleting, having Walks round them covered with Vines, of which there are two &s;orts; the one is in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language called <HI>Barmak &V;zumi,</HI> a long White Grape; the other <HI>Hevengh &V;zumi,</HI> a round Red Grape, both which growing in very large Bunches. Of the latter Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI> weighed one Bunch which was near Four Oaks (about Ten Pound <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>) The&s;e Red Grapes are not ripe till <HI>September,</HI> then they cut them off, and hang them up in their Hou&s;es for Win|ter &s;tore. Neither of the&s;e Two &s;orts grow in Vine|yards. The Vine-yards are planted mo&s;t betwixt the City, and the Sea. The City is now not above Three Miles about: Being Four Miles from <HI>Porto Lion,</HI> (which formerly was call <HI>Pirea</HI>) having a Ca&s;tle to the South. The Hou&s;es are better built here than in any part of the <HI>Morea,</HI> mo&s;t having little Courts, with high Walls,
<PB N="22" REF="13">in which are Arches with Marble Pillars; few Hou&s;es above Two Story high: They al&s;o patcht up with the Ruines of old Palaces, and in mo&s;t Walls are abun|dance of old In&s;criptions. The Governors are in the &s;ame manner as they be in other Cities under the <HI>Turks.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> live much better here than in any other part of <HI>Turky,</HI> (<HI>Scio</HI> excepted) being a &s;mall Com|mon-wealth among&s;t them&s;elves. They choo&s;e eight Magi&s;trates, who adju&s;t all differences, and appear in all Publick Matters. Their Protector (at the Port) is the Grand Seigniors Chief Eunuch, who hath the di&s;po&s;ing of that Government. The City is not Walled about, but has Gates at the Streets end, which every Night are &s;hut, to keep out Privateers, who often Land and do much mi&s;chief. Here is an Arch-Bi&s;hop who&s;e Hou&s;e &s;tands to the South We&s;t of the Town, near unto the Mount <HI>Ariopagus:</HI> He lives in great e&s;teem among&s;t them. Below his Palace towards the North, &s;tands intire the Temple of <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> which is a fair and large Building, all of White Marble, having a Portico about it with Pillars. The Temple is Seventy Three Foot long, and Twenty Six in Breadth: The Length of the Portico (which goes round it,) is One Hundred Twenty Three Foot: It is now a <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and Dedicated to St. <HI>George.</HI> To the South Ea&s;t part of the Ca&s;tle are Seventeen Marble Pillars, being the re|mainder of One Hundred and Twenty, on which the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> had his Palace: And upon &s;ome of the Pillars which &s;tand towards the Ea&s;t, is to be &s;een part of the Foundation. The&s;e Pillars are of a pure White Marble, with blewi&s;h Waves, Schollop-work, being Fifty Foot in heighth, and Nineteen and a half round. The Ground is very even about them, which they &s;ay was formerly Paved with Marble. Clo&s;e to the&s;e Pillars Ea&s;tward, is a &s;quare Piece of Ground, which is Walled in with a low Wall, being Green: It is
<PB N="23" REF="13">kept very &s;mooth and free of Stones; at the South End clo&s;e to the Wall, is a place (rai&s;ed with Two Steps) about Two Foot high, almo&s;t in Form of a Throne.

<P>The Ca&s;tle &s;tands on a Rock, which is high and &s;teep, having but one way up, and three Gates to pa&s;s through into the Body of it: The Walls are much out of re|pair. The Scituation makes it &s;trong. This Ca&s;tle &s;tood almo&s;t in the middle of Old <HI>Athens:</HI> The Place mo&s;t worth Ob&s;ervation in it, is the Temple of <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> which remains entire, being e&s;teemed (by all who have &s;een it) to be one of the Mo&s;t Glorious Buildings in <HI>Europe.</HI> It is all pure White Marble: The Length of the Body of the Temple is One Hundred Sixty Eight <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Feet, and the Breadth Seventy One: There are Seventeen Pillars at each Side, and Eight at the Front: The Circuit of the Pillars are Nineteen Foot and a Half: The Length of the whole Temple Two Hundred and Thirty Feet. The Temple is very dark, having only &s;ome Lights to the Ea&s;tward. The <HI>Greeks</HI> did Con&s;ecrate, and Dedicated it to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. Since that, the <HI>Turks</HI> have perverted it with their Wor&s;hip. The <HI>Turks</HI> have White-wa&s;h'd the In&s;ide, notwith&s;tanding it is all of pure Marble. In and about <HI>Athens,</HI> are Two Hundred <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, (mo&s;t of which have been Temples) but not one quar|ter of them are now u&s;ed. In the Plain and on mo&s;t of the Hills, there are many &s;mall Chappels. The Ruines are above Six Miles about, of which the Reader
<PB N="24" REF="14">may have full &s;atisfaction by reading the Travels of Sir <HI>George Wheeler,</HI> who hath given a large and true Account of this City. Some Geographers call it <HI>Set|tines,</HI> which name was never known to the Inhabi|tants; the <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Atinna,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks Athine.</HI> The Air is very good. The Soyl rich. It hath a River to the South, clo&s;e by the Ruines of <HI>Adrians</HI> Palace, called <HI>Illi&s;us</HI> or <HI>Calleroy;</HI> which is almo&s;t choaked up, and in Summer is dry. The Harbour of <HI>Porto Lione</HI> is very &s;ecure from the danger of any Wind, but there is no Fortification, &s;o that it is frequented by Pyrats. In all the Villages and Country about <HI>Athens,</HI> the In|habitants are mo&s;t <HI>Albane&s;es;</HI> and they are here more populous than in the <HI>Morea.</HI> It affords the &s;ame Com|modities: and all Provi&s;ion is as rea&s;onable, but their Wines in general are not &s;o good.</P>
