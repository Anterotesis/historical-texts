<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Em|bleme.</NOTE>His Standard or En&s;igne royall is all white like the Emperours, wherein is portrayed a man &s;tanding with a chayne about his necke, yet as it &s;eemeth either vnmanacled and at liberty, or at mo&s;t but in a willing and mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;erui|tude, for vnderneath him is writ a &s;entence, which &s;ignifieth in Engli&s;h, <HI>My Chayne &s;hall binde others.</HI></P>
<P>Now there be &s;ome Reporters that affirme, that in his En&s;igne be&s;ides the chayned man, there is a <HI>Tyger</HI> and a <HI>Beare,</HI> and the word as a|fore-&s;aid, and I will not &s;tand much to argue the contrary; for although it make the body of the <HI>Embleme,</HI> like a &s;urcharged coate, &s;omewhat too much burdened, again&s;t the &s;trickt rules of our curious deui&s;e-makers, yet are they all &s;o &s;ignifi|cant, and &s;o well expre&s;&s;ing the re&s;olution of a &s;trong Conquerour, that they may well become the inuention of him to vvhom they are attri|buted.</P>

<P>Next this Armie is ranked the Armie of <HI>Al|bertus,</HI> Archduke of <HI>Austria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch|dukes Ar|mie.</NOTE> and brother to the Emperour <HI>Mathyas,</HI> and are fully accounted to be one thou&s;and fiue hundred Hor&s;e-men, and tenne thou&s;and Foote-men, all good and approued Souldiers, by him bred, and di&s;cipli|ned, with great perfection in the Neather-lands, and other places, to which his occurrents haue drawne him.</P>
<P>The Generall of this Army is the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Albyod,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ge|nerall.</NOTE> a very Noble de&s;cended Gentleman, full of great &s;pirit and vvi&s;edome, and one of high e&s;timation with the Archduke, as may ap|peare by this great imployment, and many other graces and fauours done him in other &s;eruices, all which hee &s;eeketh to acknowledge in his rea|dine&s;&s;e and preparation, for any imployment &s;hall be fixed vpon him.</P>
<P>His Standard or En&s;igne royall, is all blacke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Em|pre&s;s.</NOTE> and in the mid&s;t thereof a withered Tree, and a
<PB N="20" REF="12"> &s;entence vnderneath it, &s;ignifying in Engli&s;h, <HI>Waxe greene againe,</HI> or <HI>I will waxe greene againe.</HI> Some report that hee hath in his Standard a <HI>Hearce</HI> or <HI>Tomba,</HI> which in Herraldry is an Em|bleme of di&s;paire; but I referre that to &s;ome better intelligence, for I take the other to be much more proper, and better &s;uiting with the goodne&s;&s;e of a Noble nature, which indeede is of|ten darkned with the&s;e horrid and dreadfull pre|&s;aging menaces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pre|lates Armie.</NOTE>La&s;t of all, is an Armie leauied by all tho&s;e which they entitle Catholicke Prelates, in <HI>Germa|nie,</HI> as Cardinals, Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and o|ther inferiour Prie&s;ts, all which haue with a mu|tuall con&s;ent drawne their mindes and &s;ub&s;tan|ces together, and from thence rai&s;ed vp a power of one and twenty hundred Hor&s;e men, and fif|teene thou&s;and Foote-men, not &s;o well experien|ced or approued in the Warres (by &s;uppo&s;ition) as the others be: but no doubt men daring e|nough, and apt to goe on without either care or que&s;tion of the enterpri&s;e to vvhich they are drawne, as is commonly &s;eene and allowed in men of their mercinarie quality: and doubtle&s;&s;e this Armie is compo&s;ed of all Nations what&s;o|euer, their Pur&s;es for the mo&s;t part being the
<PB N="21" REF="12"> entire commanders of their &s;trengths, being by no other bond engaged to the obedience of their Lords and Ma&s;ters; &s;o that who &s;o euer is out of imployment in this Armie, may finde bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e to preoccupate his whole &s;pirits withall.</P>
<P>The Generall of this Armie thus gathered from the very fluxe and multiplicity of Ma&s;ters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gene|rall.</NOTE> is the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Riffin,</HI> or as &s;ome call it S^t. <HI>Raffin,</HI> a man of great tru&s;t and e&s;timation, with all the Clergie in tho&s;e Countries, and much renowned for his valour, wi&s;edome, poli|cie, and many other &s;ouldierly qualities, where|with he hath beene plentifully endewed, onely &s;o violent in the blindne&s;&s;e of his Religion, or as they call it Catholick profe&s;&s;ion, that many of his acti|ons may without offence vndergoe the cen&s;ure or badge of much blood and cruelty.</P>
<P>His En&s;igne or Guidon (for indeede it can haue no other title of greatnes added vnto it)<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Em|pre&s;s.</NOTE> is all of
<PB N="22" REF="13"> a gray colour, portraying the grauity, &s;oberne&s;&s;e, and di&s;creation vvhich &s;hould be imployed in tho&s;e mighty De&s;&s;eynes, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially from men of &s;uch &s;anctity and purene&s;&s;e of life, as in right the Ma&s;ters of this Armie &s;hould be, and in the midde&s;t of this gray En&s;igne there is grow|ing in his full glory a full blowne and faire flou|ri&s;hing Lilly, with his naturall leaues, branches, and beauties about it, and vnderneath a &s;en|tence &s;ignifying in Engli&s;h the&s;e words, <HI>Natures Innocence is the be&s;t cloathing:</HI> a Motto which no doubt promi&s;eth vertuou&s;ly, if the i&s;&s;ues be an|&s;werable to the o&s;tentation: but if they be rai|&s;ed for any contrary purpo&s;e to goodne&s;&s;e, as to expell from that long enriched Empire, the true preaching of the Go&s;pell, and profe&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t true, auncient, Catholicke, and Apo|&s;tolicke Faith, there is no doubt but the ruines of their owne <HI>Babell</HI> will fall vpon them, and confound them; if otherwi&s;e it be for the bene|fit of the Chri&s;tian Faith, and the abolli&s;hing of <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his bla&s;phemies, no doubt but their Armies will &s;tand like the I&s;raelites, and finde GOD him&s;elfe continually fighting their battailes: how euer, to that power be all their powers and actions referred who is the GOD and Ma&s;ter of the hearts of Emperours, Kings, and Princes.</P>
