<HEAD>TO THE Mo&s;t worthy of all Honour, PETER BROOK OF MEIRE, In the County of <HI>CHESTER,</HI> E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>_MY Name being to appear in publick with this Tran&s;lation in an age that flouri&s;hes with Pens, and Criticks; con&s;cious of my di&s;ad|vantage, I apprehended a Patron nece&s;&s;ary; who&s;e Name in the Front, like a Princes &s;tamp upon Lead, might give authority and make it cur|rant coyne. In my low condition I have often heard your Name glorious for worth and goodne&s;s, which made me hope though far tran&s;planted, and ob&s;cure, you would grant me priviledge to claim a Title in your favour, and let the Reader opening this Book, &s;ee it is &s;omething be|longs to you; it will I am confident keep him mode&s;t, and prevent his di&s;charges at my defects. The Authour I dare &s;ay will, for gravity, novelty, and variety be accep|table to your conver&s;ation: for though divers have &s;et forth accounts of this nature, I have not met with any, in my opinion, of &s;uch credit as this.</P>
<P><HI>Le Blanc</HI> was a traveller from his infancy to his grave, <HI>64.</HI> years &s;urveying the Ma&s;ter-piece of his maker: was a per&s;on of capacity, judgement, and integrity; one
<PB REF="3">
&s;eems as it were framed and de&s;igned to be &s;ent forth, and to bring home a perfect di&s;covery, and the truth of things fables and vanity have &s;o much abu&s;ed. You will finde him a per&s;on of morall and religious principles; one who kept &s;elect company; one, who in all parts he arrived at, took not his information at the &s;hore or Suburbs, but either for occa&s;ion or curio&s;ity, vi&s;ited the inte&s;tines and &s;upreme, whence he might the better look below, and round about him. I do ingeniou&s;ly acknowledge I have injured him in the rudene&s;&s;e of tran&s;lation; which, next to my want of faculty, I be&s;eech you attribute to the ha&s;te was pre&s;&s;ed up|on me, for I had no more dayes allowed to tran&s;late it, then would &s;ufficiently have &s;erved to tran&s;cribe it: and it was the fir&s;t piece I ever attempted. As it is, I peti|tion you would afford our aged Traveller to take up a re&s;t|ing room at la&s;t in your &s;tudy, and me the honour to be owned.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOURS PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot look but with admiration, upon the &s;tu|pidity of &s;uch as are not confirmed in a due belief of divine Providence, &s;ince all mundane effects &s;hew daily &s;uch &s;en&s;ible te&s;timonies, and e&s;pecially humane Actions, wherein this wi&s;e guide directing all things to their end, is &s;ufficiently apparent, though &s;i|lently, yet forcibly compelling all things. There ap|pears te&s;timony enough in my particular, that from my fir&s;t entrance into the world, have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by this divine wi&s;dome and goodne&s;&s;e to my 78. year, my in&s;tant age, &s;o as I can give mo&s;t reall a&s;&s;urance. I have been &s;en&s;ible of &s;upernatural effects in my continual pe|regrinations through &s;uch diver&s;e parts, and &s;o remote from inhabitable Land for above &s;ixty four years, in &s;uch &s;everal dangers, both by Sea and Land, among&s;t people &s;o di&s;crepant in Religion, Laws, Manners, Language, and cour&s;e of living, through all by divine provi|dence pre&s;erved healthful, and &s;ecure, with the ble&s;&s;ing at la&s;t to produce &s;omething that may be beneficial to my country and po&s;terity. For having ever had an ob&s;ti|nate Propen&s;ion to travail, when I was &s;carce advanced out of my Infancy, and of judgement, neither for di&s;|cour&s;e, nor election; I felt though &s;ecret, &s;uch vigorous motions, that I had not power to re&s;i&s;t them: So as
<PB REF="4">
without con&s;idering why, or for what end, like a man forlorn, I threw my &s;elfe into this cour&s;e of pererra|tion; which afterward, invited by affaires, and un&s;peak|able content, I embraced with de&s;ign and re&s;olution: Nor needs it be much admired, &s;ince well con&s;idered, our life is but a continual voyage, without re&s;t or a&s;&s;u|red home, till we arrive at the end, where in a &s;empiternall &s;tate, our Soveraigne felicity in|habits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Authors embarking for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and his &s;hipwrack.</HEAD>
<P>I Was not fully arrived at my fourteenth year of age, when &s;eeing a ve&s;&s;ell making ready for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and the Grand <HI>Caire,</HI> impul&s;ed by that noble ambition to view the world, I re&s;olved to embark with the Company, though &s;ecretly, and without the privity of my deare&s;t parents. Of this ve&s;&s;el, called our <HI>Lady of Victory,</HI> one <HI>Robert Pontoine</HI> a Merchant, and my Father <HI>Raphael le Blanc</HI> were owners, which &s;o delightfully took the affections of my infancy, that I &s;pent the better part of my time aboard her. I often beg'd my Fathers con&s;ent for the voyage; but he, as a per&s;on experienced in &s;uch affairs, fore&s;eeing the hard&s;hip and dangers my tender age was to encounter, &s;till denied me. Notwith&s;tanding I per&s;i&s;ted in
<PB N="2" REF="8">
my re&s;olution to go in what &s;ort &s;oever; and though I received &s;ome &s;everities from my mother on this occa&s;ion, yet with a &s;ute of apparell and &s;ome linnens I had provided, I took my way one morning towards <HI>Civitad</HI> about five leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Mar&s;e|ills.</HI> But my mother reflecting on &s;ome words I had let fall (that they &s;hould never &s;ee me more) &s;ent &s;ome to overtake me, who with fair words per&s;waded me home again. At la&s;t &s;he perceiving my re&s;olution peremptory, and that I watched all op|portunities to e&s;cape; without acquainting my Father, who would never have con&s;ented, &s;he gave me leave: &s;o as delivering me &s;ome moneys, and recommending me to one <HI>Bapti&s;t Cote</HI> a Merchant of integrity, &s;he acquainted not the Captain, who was my Godfa|ther, becau&s;e &s;he would not have him know &s;he was privy to my voyage. Then I privately went aboard in the <HI>Victory,</HI> and dealt with the Pilot <HI>Augu&s;tine Battaillon</HI> to conceale me; which for the affection I had to travaile, and the re&s;pect he had to my Father he performed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexan|dria.

Both our Merchants and Seamen on a fe&s;tivall day coming a&s;hore to make merry, they were &s;o &s;urprized with the beauties and &s;ubtleties of the I&s;land Curtizans, that they not onely exhau&s;ted all their money but &s;old their commodities to undervalews to &s;atisfie their plea&s;ures, which &s;ome of them were glutted with to the lo&s;&s;e of their lives: and having thus &s;pent near two moneths, we put to &s;ea for <HI>France,</HI> and two or three dayes had a pro&s;perous winde, which on a &s;udden turned to the North-Ea&s;t, and imme|diately to a furious violent North-wind, that drove us up|on the coa&s;t of <HI>Turluru,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Turluru <HI>I&s;le</HI> Canee.</NOTE> an I&s;land near <HI>Canee,</HI> which is a Haven, and Town in <HI>Candia,</HI> where we ca&s;t anchor to ride out the tempe&s;tuous weather.</P>

<P>And it is worth ob&s;ervation that the greate&s;t part of our company were reprobate per&s;ons, and ab&s;olute Athei&s;ts, for &s;ome of our Marriners &s;eeing them&s;elves in this imminent danger, their ve&s;&s;el being filled with water, &s;ecured &s;ome cans of wine which they pour down their throats, among&s;t the re&s;t one <HI>Honora|tus</HI> a <HI>Mar&s;eillian,</HI> put on his be&s;t apparell, and with &s;ome <HI>French</HI> coin threw him&s;elf into the Sea: tho&s;e ra&s;cals endeavoured to pre|vent him, inviting him to drink, &s;aying 'twas better to dye full than empty, but the poor creature not able to &s;wim &s;unk im|mediately, his body was within few dayes ca&s;t upon the &s;hore, the Clark of the &s;hip &s;tript him, took his clothes and money, and buried him, &s;ince being &s;ent into <HI>France</HI> to be impowered, by the Merchants to receive four or five thou&s;and Zequines, which the goods and commodities &s;aved from &s;hipwrack were &s;old for, he carried the news to <HI>Honoratus</HI> widow, but I doubt whether he re&s;tored her his goods as he told us he did. This while the greate&s;t part of us peri&s;hed on the &s;hallowes; for of &s;ixty five per&s;ons that we were in all, but five e&s;caped, whereof (prai&s;ed be God) I was one; and every man &s;hifting for him&s;elf;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au|thor pre|&s;erved.</NOTE> by the help of a planck I got to &s;hore, after I had been fifteen hours in the wa|ter, and thus I &s;aved my &s;elf, together with the Clerk of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P><PB N="48" REF="31">This diligence was a little ra&s;h, for I was immediately advi&s;ed by our ho&s;t, a rich broker or merchant, that my camarade had taken his journey in vain, having not with him a roll of his goods &s;toln, nor the Viceroy's <HI>Cartaco</HI>; I &s;treight re&s;olved to follow him with the papers and pa&s;&s;e-port he &s;tood in need of: <HI>Ca&s;&s;is</HI> overtook this venturer at <HI>Ormus,</HI> where he debauched at his charge, and for want of the li&s;t of wares nothing could be proved again&s;t him.

<P>Tho&s;e in the &s;hippe fore&s;eeing the danger they were in, threw over-board all their Artilery, and all other things of weight they had therein, and threw away their main Ma&s;t; and by this means, they e&s;caped the &s;helve and rock, being &s;uddenly thrown out of that narrow pa&s;&s;age, by a great wave; but behold their greate&s;t misfortune, e&s;caping one danger, they fell into another; for &s;eeing their &s;hip begin to fill with water, having &s;prung a leake, they were forced to commit them&s;elves to the mercy of their fierce&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The Captain <HI>Don &s;ano Mendo</HI> advi&s;ed them to prepare for land, and to re&s;olve to &s;ell their lives dear, &s;ince there was no hopes for a handful of people to e&s;cape the cruelties of &s;o many barbarous villaines, they &s;uddenly cut and broak the &s;hip to flitters, every one &s;natching a planck, endeavouring to reach the &s;hore, which was about halfe a league off, and having put them&s;elves in the be&s;t order, could be expected in the like di&s;order or confu&s;ion, with &s;uch arms they could carry as &s;words and axes; as they were

The King of the country di&s;covering his &s;ubjects fal&s;hood, (which cau&s;es him no &s;mall contempt and prejudice) he forbids trading, and takes notice of what quantity of pepper or other Drugge or commodities each &s;ubject hath, and &s;ets &s;uch a rate upon them, as they may gain thereby; then he &s;ends one of his chief officers with them to the Magazine, to trade and vent the&s;e commodities to &s;trange Merchants; &amp; they u&s;ually exchange or put off their commodities for half the rate in ready mony, the other half in other &s;orts of commodities. The <HI>Bahar</HI> of pepper which is 360. pound weight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bahar</HI> Peper.</NOTE> is worth three crowns and a half, or four at the deare&s;t, which amounts to about a Ducatoon, or 55. pence. Notwith&s;tanding this order, many are privately licen&s;ed, to trade freely, and by help of the <HI>Portuguais</HI> interpreters, much is to be got. They have many &s;orts of jewels, aromatick drugs, and mo&s;t excellent balms; there is great plenty of all &s;orts of fowl and fruit; they feed much upon <HI>Buffle,</HI> which they e&s;teem an excel|lent meat; their beefs have a &s;welling upon the top of their necks (like their Cammels) which is only fat: &s;heep of no wool. There are many tame Elephants, and great &s;tore of wild ones in the woods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting of Ele|phants.</NOTE> Tho&s;e of <HI>Malaca</HI> who live upon the Continent with the Kings leave, come hither to hunt the Elephant, with their hunts|men and engines, with many trumpets, hoboyes, and drums, with fire, to fright and to drive them up into a &s;treight, and when they have taken them, they almo&s;t fami&s;h them; then they bring them among&s;t the tame ones; and by degrees make them &s;o, feeding them gently, and otherwi&s;e in&s;tructing them, and in time they become very ready to learn, and &s;erviceable in all things.</P>

They cannot read at all, nor have coyne: They make &s;tuffes of the bark of a tree, to cover their nakedne&s;&s;e.</P>

<P>And indeed we trade not with them without &s;ome danger, by rea&s;on of their cruelty, and bruti&s;hne&s;&s;e, &s;ince &s;ome &s;hips coming from <HI>Malaca,</HI> to <HI>Sumatra,</HI> killed &s;ome of their people pa&s;&s;ing by, ever &s;ince they &s;tood upon their guards, and have &s;urpri&s;ed as many as they could, and have &s;truck &s;uch a terrour into tho&s;e parts, that whoever pa&s;&s;es there, mu&s;t be &s;trong and well advi&s;ed, otherwi&s;e they are &s;ure to be robbed, mur|dered and eaten.</P>

come (as the cu&s;tom was) to devour them, and indeed as they came to &s;trangle the poore men, they cudgelled them &s;o lu&s;tily that they left the &s;port, and the man recovering his health, lived many years after; and thus was di&s;covered the roguerie of tho&s;e <HI>Magitians,</HI> who thorough an in&s;atiate thir&s;t of blood, when a man was the lea&s;t indi&s;po&s;ed, made him believe he could not live, advi|&s;ing him to ha&s;t to their fathers God. Then the poore patient with teares in his eyes, de&s;ired them to clean&s;e their bones, when they &s;hould have con&s;umed their fle&s;h, believing that their &s;oules would not be at re&s;t, til their fle&s;h were wholly con&s;umed, &amp; that then they would reunite to the body, and to remain in peace for all eternity.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the King under&s;tanding what had happened to <HI>Ba&s;a|ram</HI> and his &s;lave, cau&s;ed him to be brought before him, and laugh|ing told him, that (if he would not devour the Magitian) he would put him to death.

One being once (as I may &s;ay) condemned or &s;enten|ced to death by a Wizard, and left off; was undertaken by one of our company, and recovered in nine dayes, which made them believe the Chri&s;tians were more knowing then their Magicians: the like happened to another, who&s;e wife was by a Chri&s;tian per|&s;waded, to &s;hut out the Magician that had given his opinion of her husband; he recovering, was &s;atisfied of the abu&s;es and fal&s;e|hoods of their Magicians, <HI>Pagodes,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tigais,</HI> and of their fal&s;e Prie&s;ts, and was al&s;o in&s;tructed in the truth, and purity of our Re|ligion, that he might leave his own Idolatries: but Alas, the poor creatures heart being hardened, replyed: I believe (&s;aid he) that thy God is great, and more powerful then ours, and that being &s;o great and Maje&s;tical, he will not vouch&s;afe to make him&s;elf known to &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;imple creatures, as we are; and it would be very unfit to believe a God were not willing to com|mand us.

<P>He told me he was very de&s;irous to go witne&s;&s;e what I related of <HI>Macaraou,</HI> at <HI>Cambay,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> but &s;ince I have di&s;covered, that there is nothing liker to what I have &s;aid of <HI>Macaraou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maskaret</HI> of <HI>Bourde|aux.</HI></NOTE> then the <HI>Ma&s;caret</HI> of <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI> That is well known to be a moun|tain of water gathered together (in the River of <HI>Dourdonne</HI>) while the waters are all quiet; that mountain is framed on a &s;ud|den, and rolles down the river, overturning what boats &s;oever are in the way, which every man endeavours to avoyd, making with all ha&s;te to the &s;hoare.</P>
<P>I have a&s;ked the rea&s;on of the Inhabitants, who have told me it proceeded from the height of the Seas, meeting with the ebbe of the River, and by that encounter this water gathers together, but others agree not to this, for (if &s;o) the like would happen in the <HI>Garonne,</HI> and in other places, which I never heard of:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Garonnne</HI> River.</NOTE> &s;o that with more rea&s;on they attribute the cau&s;e to &s;ome ayre inclo&s;ed in &s;ome channel or &s;pring under ground, running from <HI>Garonne</HI> to <HI>Dourdonne,</HI> which rai&s;es this mountain of water when the Sea flows: but I know not whether the &s;ame rea&s;on might be given for <HI>Macaraou.</HI></P>

<P>When they are tame they are lodged in a Princely roome, pain|ted over, with imagary and forre&s;t work, and are fed in &s;ilver, the King e&s;teems them the &s;trength of his Army, they are richly at|tired, and eat bread, they are fed with &s;everall &s;orts of corn, or grain boyled, as barly, rice, lupins, and others, they love fruit, but care neither for fle&s;h, nor &s;i&s;h.</P>

<P>I remember that in this &s;olemnity a ba&s;e fellow cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet before the Royal Throne, the bea&s;ts &s;topt &s;uddenly, and could not be driven on till the Criminal was brought unto them, who expected death, a to&s;&s;e or two at the lea&s;t.

<P>I &s;aw a mighty big one pre&s;ented to the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> by him of <HI>Siam</HI> his Tributary.

<P>The King admired his prudence, and cau&s;ed him water to be brought in a clean &s;ilver ve&s;&s;ell, and bought him harne&s;&s;e, mo&s;t rich and magnificent; they are &s;ometimes &s;erved in golden ve&s;&s;ells, and with great re&s;pect, o|therwi&s;e they will kill their Keeper for the lea&s;t offence.</P>

When the people are ac|quainted with the Kings will, they generally leave home, wife, and children, and follow the King; every town and village hath a trea&s;urer, who duely pay the pen&s;ions allotted by the King, and every one is &s;ure of a livelyhood, according to his merit in the Kings &s;ervice, which is faithfully di&s;charged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Triennial Gover|nours.</NOTE>The Governours of all towns have triennial commi&s;&s;ions, and are promoted according to their birth to the kings favour, and the peoples free con&s;ent.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. Of the Idols in <HI>Pegu,</HI> bloudy Sacrifices, Exorci&s;ms, &s;trange Communions.</HEAD>
<P>WE have mentioned before how the Rivers of the Country yield the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> a grand revenue in fine gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idols of <HI>Pegu.</HI></NOTE> which he de&s;igns for embelli&s;hment of his Temples and Idols, whereof they have abundance of &s;uch extravagant effigies, as the Devil pre&s;ents to their fancies. They have excellent ca&s;ters and &s;cul|ptors, that draw the&s;e apparitions to the life, which generally are exceeding hideous and formidable: for the Devil becomes vi&s;ibly conver&s;ant with the&s;e poor wretches, &s;hewing them any thing they de&s;ire, the more firmly to engage them to his &s;ervice. At the Princes Palace in the back Court, there are abundance of the&s;e Idols, all of pure gold, with Crowns, enriched with gems, as I &s;aid before; one among&s;t the re&s;t of a prodigious heighth, they call <HI>Apalita,</HI> who a&s;&s;i&s;ts pilgrims and travellers, through the world, who&s;e Temple no man vi&s;its but with &s;ome pre&s;ent, which is converted to the u&s;e of the Prie&s;ts, who ordinarily have wives and children.

adoration would think to have &s;ome mi&s;erable end before they returned home, if they brought not &s;ome offering with them, &s;o as he that hath but a leather to cover his pudenda, will take it off to offer to the Idol: others will pre&s;ent little bels of &s;ilver and gold which they hang at their genitories, in little rings drawn through the fle&s;h, which they do to be the better e&s;teemed of women, te&s;tifying herein that they delight in no other &s;ex but theirs. Some there are &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly devout,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bleeding &s;acrifices.</NOTE> that they will cut them|&s;elves to immolate the bloud to their Idol. 'Tis &s;omething proba|ble that the <HI>Turks</HI> who &s;o &s;carifie their bodies for devotion, learnt it of the <HI>Indians,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Alcoran</HI> contains no &s;uch pre|cept.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts confirm them vigorou&s;ly in this Idolatry, and &s;ome there have been who meeting poor <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchants and tra|vellers, ignorant of their cu&s;tom pa&s;&s;ing by their Temple, have cruelly cut their throats, and &s;acrificed them to their <HI>A|palita.</HI> But the Je&s;uites complaining to the King, and &s;hewing him the horrour and indignity of &s;uch an execration, he &s;entenced to death 70. of the&s;e abominable Prie&s;ts, and the &s;entence had pa&s;&s;ed further even to their wives and children, but for the media|tion of the Fathers. Notwith&s;tanding their devotion, the people looked upon this execution patiently, and without the lea&s;t com|motion, for the affection they bear their Prince. Likewi&s;e through the &s;upplications of tho&s;e Fathers, they were freed from a pe&s;ti|lentiall di&s;ea&s;e then reign'd among&s;t rhem.</P>
<P>Some among&s;t the&s;e Prie&s;ts u&s;e holy a&s;hes and holy water al&s;o. They are the a&s;hes of things &s;acrificed to the Idols, and a|mong&s;t the re&s;t of &s;uch as have made them&s;elves voluntary &s;a|crifices. There is another Idol of &s;ilver, in the proportion of a Gyant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy a&s;hes and holy water. An oracu|lous Idol.</NOTE> who as an Oracle makes an&s;wer to demands, foretells things to come, but with a thou&s;and lyes and a|bu&s;es. They believe this <HI>Pagode,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ts them in their wars, and as their <HI>Mars</HI> renders them victorious: They coin money in honour of him, and &s;tamp his name upon it: But he is not alwaies effectuall in his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for at the time they &s;acrificed the poor <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> I told you of, the Inhabitants of <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Malacca</HI> for revenge mann'd eight Gallions and &s;ome Carvells, put in at one of their Towns, which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idols de|&s;troyed by the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e.</HI></NOTE> thence advanced to another which they pillaged, burnt the Temples and Idols, with all the Prie&s;ts, their wives and children.</P>
<P>'Twas at the time the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> was gone to the Conque&s;t of <HI>Siam,</HI> &s;o as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> alarm'd the whole Countrey, and had <HI>Don Alou&s;e d' Aquila,</HI> who commanded the Foot, arrived in time, they had ea&s;ily carried the Town of <HI>Pegu</HI> it &s;elf, taken the Kings trea&s;ure, with the Idols rich in gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones, which had been a wealth ine&s;ti|mable.
<PB N="127" REF="70">
They put abundance to the &s;word, and carried a|way numbers of pri&s;oners: But at the Kings return the Je|&s;uites reconciled the difference betwixt them; at which time 'twas accorded that at new <HI>Pegu,</HI> in honour of the Concepti|on of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, a Church &s;hould be built at the Kings charges, which in the&s;e parts is no novelty, where from time out of memory, as I &s;aid, they have had an image in ho|nour of the Virgin with her infant, illu&s;trated with three lamps, and the Temple of God where this image was reverenced, was &s;er|ved with divers &s;orts of Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Pegu</HI> this while was much incen&s;ed for the af|front, the violence and indi&s;cretion of the&s;e Prie&s;ts had brought upon him, and conceived a hope that the very Idols would take &s;ome revenge for the injuries they had &s;uffered from the <HI>Franques Ramatas,</HI> &s;o they call the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but he was perplexed, when in&s;tead thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tooth of an ape.</NOTE> he ob&s;erved them per&s;e|ver pro&s;perous, daily overturning more Idols, as they had a|mong&s;t others burnt the famous Apes tooth adored in <HI>Zelan,</HI> which he would have purcha&s;ed at the rate of &s;o many thou&s;and crowns, as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>Another Idoll they have, called <HI>Fotoque,</HI> (as likewi&s;e in <HI>Ja|pan</HI> and <HI>China</HI>) of the &s;ame &s;tature as the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fotoque</HI> an Idoll.</NOTE> but of different matter, of lead and bra&s;&s;e mixt, &s;uch as their money is made of. They tell us this Idol with his interce&s;&s;ion inclines their <HI>Duma,</HI> and obtains grace for all, in particular, for &s;oules condemned to black and dark places. The <HI>Palpas</HI> are obliged to &s;acri|fice to him every Saturday a black &s;wine, and three pullets of the &s;ame colour. Poultry in this Country contrary to the ordinary, have their fle&s;h black, which they call <HI>Fare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fle&s;h of hens black.</NOTE> and makes the pottage black, neverthele&s;&s;e very &s;avoury. All the Sacrifices pa&s;&s;e into the Prie&s;ts bellies, for they burn nothing but the liver with aromatick odours, and pulverizing the bones, mix it with their holy waters.</P>
<P>When they would have any &s;acrifices brought to their Idol, they go about the Town, ringing a Bell made like a Still,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacrifices for the dead.</NOTE> and &s;ay this is to &s;upplicate for &s;ome of their friends, who are tor|mented in the black &s;hades; for as to tho&s;e which immitted in|to other bodies, as of oxen or cows there to be kept till the day of judgement, they hold them well quartered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">temp|&s;yco&s;e.</NOTE> and to have no need of prayers.</P>
<P>For this cau&s;e the <HI>Peguans</HI> had a cu&s;tome to eat none of the&s;e &s;orts of fle&s;h, as in <HI>Malabar</HI> and other places; but &s;ince &s;uch time as their <HI>Duma</HI> in a vi&s;ion gave precept to one of their <HI>Chaouris,</HI> to u&s;e all living bea&s;ts indifferently, and that a &s;oule condemned to the body of one bea&s;t, when that dyed, pa&s;&s;ed into the body of another, they have made no further difficulty to eat it. For &s;uch bea&s;ts they have
<PB N="128" REF="71">
a reverence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Super&s;ti|tious &s;alu|tations. A&s;&s;es for cha&s;e.</NOTE> and bow to them as they would &s;alute a friend.</P>
<P>They have a &s;ort of &s;mall A&s;&s;es that come from the Pro|vince of <HI>Beluacarin,</HI> almo&s;t all red and black, or black and white, which they hunt and take with hayes like Co|nies, and being brought to hand &s;erve for many u&s;es, but are of low price, by rea&s;on they hold &s;oules never enter them, their fle&s;h is &s;o faint and di&s;agreeable: we met with heards of them in the Champian, which appeared to be tame, &s;uffering one to come &s;o near as to lay hand on their neck; when on a &s;uddain they &s;prung away like Mun|keys, and returned about a quarter of an hour after. They are not &s;o courtly to them as to other bea&s;ts, for the o|pinion the Prie&s;ts have put in them: and as we in de|ri&s;ion would &s;alute them, they would reprove us, and tell us, their great <HI>Duma</HI> had commanded <HI>Fotoque</HI> to cur&s;e the genera|tion of A&s;&s;es, and the &s;oules that &s;hould take up habitation in them.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e many other Gods, as that they call the god of atomes in the Sun, and others. Hell, they call the dark cavern of the hou&s;e of &s;moak, where a horrible Serpent devoures &s;oules, and whence one of their gods frees them by his power.</P>
<P>In a word, 'tis &s;tupendous to con&s;ider the number of gods and Idols in their &s;everall temples; their Mona&s;teries, Prie&s;ts, Monks, Hermits, Sects, Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their belief likewi&s;e of the Creation of the world is &s;trange, and of the &s;in of the fir&s;t man, all disfigured with a thou&s;and fables.

He learnt, that 'tis held the <HI>Peguans</HI> de&s;cended originally from certain Jews, &s;ome|times bani&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pegu|ans</HI> creed.</NOTE> and by <HI>Salomon</HI> condemned to work in the mines of <HI>Ophir:</HI> that they believed an infinity of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive worlds to all eternity, innumerable gods receding re&s;pectively to the diver&s;e worlds, and lyable to death at la&s;t. That men having pa&s;&s;ed thorough all &s;orts of animalls at la&s;t became Gods, and that the&s;e Soules after many ages being purified in certain appointed places, and having returned diver&s;e times into the&s;e new worlds at la&s;t, were placed &s;ome in Paradi&s;e, others in Hell, and &s;ome reduced to <HI>Niban,</HI> that is, nothing, and a thou&s;and other dreams.

&s;ignal &s;ervices they did them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Je&s;uites in <HI>Pegu.</HI></NOTE> in certain popular maladies they were infected with. As among&s;t others, Father <HI>Andrew</HI> of the &s;ocie|ty, at the time that an epidemical pe&s;tilence de&s;troyed innumerable people in <HI>Pegu,</HI> a Chri&s;tian Town&s;man came and be&s;ought his interce&s;&s;ion for his family, that was wholly infected; and the Fa|ther demanding wherefore he had not cau&s;ed his wife and chil|dren to be baptized, he an&s;wered, he had &s;uch a real intention, but that their <HI>Pagode</HI> had prohibited him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conver&s;i|on and truth.</NOTE> and that his wife would not permit it, but threatned, if he forced Bapti&s;me up|on her or hers, &s;he would publi&s;h his ob&s;equies according to cu&s;tom, and marry another: which excu&s;e the Father took for &s;ome &s;atisfaction, and at his &s;upplications the people were cu|red. Whereupon many more repaired to him for the &s;ame cau&s;e, but he would not grant them any &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances but upon engagement to receive Bapti&s;me; which their Prie&s;ts vigo|rou&s;ly &s;ought to hinder, telling them 'twere better to dy of that malady then be damned by the cure of Bapti&s;me.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI>, among&s;t other &s;uper&s;titions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extrava|gant com|munions.</NOTE> which they have derived by corruption from Chri&s;tiani&s;me, they have one ex|ceeding remarkable, which is, that once a year they make a &s;o|lemn communion. Having immolated a white &s;heep, and mingled the blood with meal, they call <HI>Agricar</HI>; on the day of the great fea&s;t of <HI>Duma,</HI> they give it to the whole congregation in form of a heart, with exhortations and remon&s;trance, that this which they take, is the blood of their God, and upon that day &s;trangers are not admitted to celebrate the &s;olemnity: but on the morrow they are received, and before they communicate, a Sermon is made to excite them to devotion, telling them their God receives them into his alliance, embraces them as his children, to whom he gives his grace by meanes of the blood they have taken. Behold how they transform and prophane what they have been heretofore taught of the My&s;tery of the Pa&s;chal lamb, and the Euchari&s;t. In <HI>Mexica</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> they have likewi&s;e confe&s;&s;ion and Communion after their manner. But they have another &s;ort of &s;acrifice yet more &s;trange, that is, they buy a &s;lave of a high price, of thirty yeares age, beautiful, &s;ound, and jolly, and ha|ving wa&s;hed him in a lake, or other water three mornings by the ri&s;ing of the Sun, they cloath him in a white gown, keep him fourty dayes, and &s;hew him to the people, telling them, this is the innocent that mu&s;t be &s;acrificed for the &s;ins of the peo|ple. Then every one brings pre&s;ents to him, and with humility be&s;eeches him to remember them when he &s;hall come before the great God. All this while they take a heedful care he e&s;cape not, giving him good cheer, and <HI>Areca.</HI> Every morning for the fourty dayes when they &s;hew him, they beat a kind of Pan, and melodiou&s;ly play on flutes doleful, and pathetical &s;traines, to excite devotion, in which con&s;et every one beares a part that he

may be mindful of them. Thirty dayes expired, the ten Prie&s;ts called <HI>Gaica,</HI> per&s;ons of veneration and antiquity, habited like the <HI>Victim,</HI> come to adverti&s;e him, that within ten days he goes to inhabit with the great God, and ob&s;erve diligently if his counte|nance change at the &s;ound of death; and take it for an ominous augury, if he &s;hew the lea&s;t fear: For which cau&s;e on the day ap|pointed, they give him a certain potion that renders him as 'twere frantick, and takes all apprehen&s;ion from him. After diver&s;e other ceremonies on the fortith, they &s;acrifice him, and after eat him.</P>
<P>They lead him to the very top of their Temple, &s;tretch him as it were into an oval upon a &s;tone of the &s;ame figure, rip up his belly alive, tear out his heart which they burn, and &s;acrifice to their Idol, be&s;mearing their cheeks with the blood.

<P>During this &s;pace, they religiou&s;ly ab&s;tain from all inordinate plea&s;ures.

For as they carry along their Idol upon a &s;ix-wheel chariot drawn by Oxen, or Bufflers covered with flowers, and attended by the multitude, along the town, there are ever two or three pitiful wretches on a Scaffold in
<PB N="131" REF="72">
long gowns of gray cloth, who declare to the people how they are ready to &s;acrifice them&s;elves for the &s;anctification of the re&s;t; Then down they come with a countenance pale and di&s;|figur'd with apprehen&s;ion of death, and ca&s;t them&s;elves under the wheels of the chariot, where they are cru&s;hed to death. One there was who after he had been well fed by the <HI>Palpas</HI> or Prie&s;ts for five dayes together, as a thing &s;acred, when the houre of &s;acrifice was come, his no&s;e bled, and he would not dye upon any terms, for what&s;oever the Prie&s;ts could &s;ay &s;o to encourage him, but at the &s;ame in&s;tant there was another, who voluntarily offered to take his place, and was broken un|der the wheels: afterwards his corps was laid in the chariot by the Idol on the &s;ide of felicity. For the Idol bears in one hand a number of Serpents, to puni&s;h &s;uch as obey not his commands, and in the other a cup of &s;ome exqui&s;ite liquor, to recompen&s;e his good &s;ervants.</P>
<P>They have &s;pecial honour for the&s;e mi&s;erable Votaries, and all their Alliance. The &s;acrifice ended, they take the mur|thered bodies, and give them honourable burial wrapped in a &s;ear-cloath, and entombe them with &s;olemn ceremonies, and in|&s;trumental mu&s;ick, all their alliances coming for certain dayes to rejoyce over the Sepulcher. When, any one being &s;ick, the Ma|gician &s;hall declare him irrecoverable, he is put apart in a gar|den, one of his family being appointed to attend him. But if he chances to recover, he is held as a reprobate, and no man will vi&s;it or conver&s;e with him; &s;aying, that had he been any thing of good, their God had not di&s;dained his company. And if he de&s;ires to be admitted in &s;ociety, the <HI>Chaouri</HI> or Sorcerer mu&s;t make a &s;acrifice of Purification for him: then being purified, he makes his friends a fea&s;t of the fle&s;h of black cattle onely, e&s;pecially a goat, which is eaten with a grand ceremony.</P>

<P>FOr account of this Great King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> his creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Royall Officers.</NOTE> and Mi|litia, I will &s;ay in few words what I there learnt. A Prince of high Quality in the Empire, called the <HI>Califerech,</HI> is as it were Con&s;table, and grand Ma&s;ter, who by pre&s;cription a&s;si&s;ts at the Election and Coronation of the Prince, which cannot be done without him.

them; and returning in gracefull order to the Town, a thou&s;and &s;orts of fireworks play, the Fortre&s;s Cannon is fired, and all in good order to receive them. Being arrived at the Pallace, abun|dance of Clarions and Trumpets &s;ound, and a Noble man &s;ayes with a loud voice. The <HI>Califerech</HI> commands you all to joyn in prayers, that if our Prince be not worthy, he may die before his inauguration, and the people cry out aloud, <HI>God grant it.</HI> Im|mediately after a repa&s;t they create Officers, being nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be cho&s;en with the good liking of the Prince. The better part of the Officers have <HI>Arabian</HI> names, in imitation of <HI>Sechemir</HI> of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to which almo&s;t all the Princes of the Ea&s;t conform them&s;elves, as the mo&s;t magnificent.

<P>The <HI>Amiracho,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of hor&s;e, that di&s;po&s;es of the Kings hor&s;es, mules, elephants, camels, dromedaries. The <HI>Amural</HI> that governs the Elephants.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e there are abundance of inferiour Officers, and Honourable Per&s;ons of War, who receive pay by the moneth, ac|cording to the occurrence of Affaires, to which the Merchants many times contribute for convoy of their free Commodities.

<P>AS to the revenues of the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Revenues of the King of <HI>Pegu.</HI></NOTE> when peoples or|dinary payments are brought in, there is Proclamation through the Dominions, that no Subject is obliged to pay any Royall right, gabell, &s;ub&s;idy, or impo&s;t, for a whole year. What Handicraftsmen alone pay him amounts to three millions, or as they reckon &s;o many <HI>Ba&s;elins,</HI> a &s;ort of weight. Every hou&s;e-keeper payes him &s;o much by the year. When a new King is elected, all Towns and Villages &s;end Deputies to make their acknowledgement, with pre|&s;ents of rarities, and things extraordinary: As to the elect in our time, were &s;ent three white Cowes, with tayles dif|fering from others, like &s;wine, hornes growing in their &s;kins only, not on the top of the head, which they could move as their eares, decked bard bridles, covered with cloathes of crim&s;on &s;ilk, and hung over with bells of gold, &s;ilver, and <HI>Calin,</HI> a mettal like &s;ilver, much u&s;ed in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>This pre&s;ent was very acceptable to him, notwith&s;tanding 'twas done in deri&s;ion of another people, his Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calin</HI> a mettle.</NOTE> who wear the like bells at their genitories, to content their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es, with little hooks, and rings to take them off when they go to vi&s;it them, and te&s;tifie to them they have &s;ati&s;|faction in nothing but them&s;elves; for among&s;t them there are that are addicted to the unnaturall &s;in, no more prohi|bited there than among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> except there be vio|lence u&s;ed, for which there is &s;evere puni&s;hment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sodomie.</NOTE> When the fir&s;t Prince of the kingdom comes to take his leave, he embraces him and ki&s;&s;es his cheek, then pre&s;ents him with ten fair white <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> cour&s;ers, barded with cloth of gold, of diver&s;e colours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bells for bea&s;ts only.</NOTE> their feet hang'd round with bells of gold, to &s;hew the people they are proper onely for bea&s;ts to wear.</P>

The King hath four hundred &s;laves, but they are only for the &s;ervice of the hou&s;hold, without regard to either Nation or Re|ligion, &s;o they are hone&s;t and &s;erviceable: They have no wa|ges, yet never want money, for all that have occa&s;ion at Court, &s;till give them &s;omething.

All the&s;e &s;ilks come to the benefit of the

The cu&s;tom of the country is, that as &s;oon as one hath perpetrated a crime, he layes by his apparel, puts on a white &s;hirt that drawes on the ground, like per&s;ons doing pen|nance with us, goes bare-head, and bare-foot, lies &s;tretched out upon the ground, and &s;o attends his &s;entence.</P>
<P>Some there are &s;it down, others &s;tand upright, according to the nature of the offence. Many that pre&s;ume upon the Princes grace, are deceived, and meet their death.</P>

But they take diligent care in the&s;e marriages of the great ones, that the women have free choyce with the con&s;ent of their kindred, to the end it may be the vehemence of affection that obliges them to &s;o cruel a te|&s;timony.

<P>But that truculent &s;acrifice they immolate to their Gods of their poor and wretched daughters, is no le&s;&s;e &s;trange and truculent: for in a part of this va&s;t Empire to celebrate the fea&s;t of their great <HI>Crocouatas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacrifice of their own chil|dren.</NOTE> they bring up their daughters in the Temple, Virgins devoted to prayer and fa&s;ting, who are con&s;ecrated and pre&s;erved for the &s;olemn &s;acrifice in &s;uch &s;ort, as when Father, Mother, or kindred vi&s;its them, they do it with reverence and adoration, as to Saints and cele&s;tial per&s;ons, and entreat they would be mindful of them, when they have the honour to come before their great God: for this con&s;ideration they bring them for an offering all &s;orts of dainties. Every year they &s;acrifice one of the&s;e poor girles. In the front of the altar &s;tands a marble &s;tone very radiant, and of various colours, where they imagine they behold the figure of that furious <HI>Demon</HI> they adore.

Now it fell out the King of <HI>Tazatay</HI> was engaged in a &s;harp war with the King of <HI>Mandranella,</HI> and &s;ent to the two Brother-Princes his Sons, for aid: who both ha&s;tening with a good &s;trength of Souldiers, one knowing nothing of the other, the one declining his direct way, marched up to the enemy, and in a bloudy fight defeated him: thence went to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to his Father, but by &s;ad de&s;tiny on the morrow, his Brother arriving from <HI>Verma</HI> with his Lady, in the evening came &s;ecretly into the Town to vi&s;it a Lady, once their anci|ent Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An unfor|tunate meeting.</NOTE> the other Brother being on the &s;ame de&s;ign they met at the Ladies gate by night, not knowing one ano|ther, where furious with jealou&s;ie, after &s;ome words they drew and killed each other. One of them dying, among&s;t many other things &s;aid he, gave humble thanks to God that he had prevented the direfull de&s;tiny of his Horo&s;cope, in not ma|king him the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ine of his Brother, as 'twas prejudicated: Hereupon the other finding him by his voice and di&s;cour&s;e, drawing near his end him&s;elf, crept to him, and embraced him with tears and lamentations, and &s;o both dolefully ended their dayes together.</P>
<P>The Father being advertized of it, &s;eeing his white haires led by his own fault to &s;o hard a fortune, overborn with grief and de&s;pair, came and &s;lew him&s;elf upon the bodies of his Sons, and with the grief and tears of all the people, were buried all three in the &s;ame monument: which &s;hews us the danger of too great curio&s;ity, nor is it an ea&s;ie que|&s;tion how this can be found by knowledge of the &s;tars, or if they are things inevitable, which I leave to be decided by the more learned.</P>
<P>But before I end this Chapter I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that among&s;t &s;uch a diver&s;ity of Idols, as well of the great <HI>Corcouitas,</HI> who is the principal and mo&s;t ancient, on whom all the others depend, as of the <HI>Oy&s;ima,</HI> the promotor of all things, and diver&s;e other &s;trange and horrible &s;hapes, every one with Temples and Sacrifices peculiar, among&s;t all this they have, as I &s;aid, the image of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin with her infant, which with lighted lamps they honour reverently. The&s;e lamps are not of gla&s;&s;e, but <HI>Talc</HI>

&s;tone, of which they have abundance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Talc</HI> in|&s;tead of gla&s;&s;e.</NOTE> whole mountains at one point of the Countrey, ea&s;tward. They work it very artificially, and make of it &s;everall &s;orts of Uten&s;ills, compounding the met|tle <HI>Calin,</HI> &s;o much e&s;teemed through the <HI>Indies,</HI> from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as far as <HI>China,</HI> like &s;ilver; but as ea&s;ily melted as tin. Of this they likewi&s;e make their windowes, and lantorns: lantorns they likewi&s;e make of the triple coloured tortoi&s;e &s;hell I &s;poke of before.</P>
<P>I omitted to tell you that for their dances they u&s;e a &s;ort of pans, which being wel handled, yeild an elegant melody,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;icall In&s;tru|ments.</NOTE> but to play well requires long practice.

For the quality of their yeares, I could not well under|&s;tand their manner of account, but in generall I find they reckon by Moones, as the greater part of the ea&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pegu|an</HI> yeares.</NOTE> and their dayes by the &s;un; out of the&s;e Moones they rai&s;e five dayes, allowing thir|teen Moones to the year; and the fift day being come, about mid|night they make a &s;olemn &s;acrifice in their Temples, where they univer&s;ally meet. I conferd with &s;ome about this matter, who told me, the <HI>Peguan</HI> year was like that they u&s;e in <HI>China,</HI> which is Lunary, and that they compare it as neer as may be to the Solary; for their year con&s;i&s;ting of twelve moneths, twice in five years they gain a Lunary month, making that year of thirteen Moones, &s;o as they have no knowledg of the golden number, nor the nineteen years circle, and the anticipation of one hour and twenty eight mi|nutes, which remits the new Moones to the golden number, with them is accommoded by the annuall &s;upputation: for they nei|ther have, nor will have a perpetuall <HI>Calander,</HI> but at great charge print every year a new one, which they &s;end through all the Pro|vinces of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>It may be our <HI>Peguans</HI> would imitate this after their fa&s;hion, and according to their under&s;tanding, which is very weak for &s;uch matters, which the be&s;t wits among&s;t us find task hard e|nough.</P>

<P>Before I leave the &s;tate of <HI>Pegu,</HI> I will not omit what &s;ome of the <HI>Peguans</HI> told me, and have mentioned in writing in their Tra|vailes. That &s;ome yeares before we arrived, there was in the Countrey a King of the ancient Royall Race, who had many Depu|ties in the Countrey of <HI>Bramaa,</HI> towards the Lake <HI>Chiamay,</HI> a|mong&s;t the re&s;t, one in the Kingdom of <HI>Tangu</HI> that rebelled again&s;t him, defeated and &s;lew him, and made him&s;elf King of <HI>Pegu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alterati|ons in <HI>Pe|gu.</HI></NOTE> they called him the <HI>Bramaa</HI> of <HI>Tangu,</HI> a great Tyrant, and a Potent Prince, who by force of Armes joyned many Kingdomes to his Empire, as <HI>Pram, Melintay, Calani, Bacam, Mirandu, Aua, Marta|ban,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="81">
and others; He afterwards was put to death by a <HI>Peguan</HI> Lord, called <HI>Xemin,</HI> of <HI>Zatan,</HI> who made him&s;elf King, but was defeated, and &s;lain by another, called <HI>Xemindoo,</HI> who likewi&s;e being made King, was not long after defeated, and put to death by <HI>Chau|migren,</HI> of near aliance to <HI>Bramaa,</HI> who became one of the mo&s;t Powerfull Kings hath raigned in <HI>Pegu,</HI> who brought totally un|der the Empire of the Kingdom of <HI>Syan,</HI> with twelve great King|domes more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Va&s;t Ar|mies in the Ea&s;t.</NOTE> They report that in the War of <HI>Syan,</HI> he led into the field &s;eventeen hundered thou&s;and Combatants, and &s;even|teen thou&s;and Elephants, whereof nine thou&s;and were for fight, the re&s;t for carriage. To which the immen&s;e Armies brought heretofore by the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kings again&s;t the <HI>Grecians,</HI> may induce us to give credit; the cau&s;e is, that in all the&s;e Ea&s;tern Countreys, the greater part of the people go to the wars, and that there are not among&s;t them &s;o many Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, Lawyers, Clarks, Book|men, and idle Per&s;ons as are with us.</P>
<P>The King that raigned in <HI>Pegu</HI> in our time, called the <HI>Brama,</HI> was as I think, the &s;on of this <HI>Chaumigren,</HI> afterwards hard enough dealt with by the Kings of <HI>Tangu, Aracan,</HI> and <HI>Syan,</HI> as I &s;aid be|fore.</P>

but we had not been long there when there came about us an ex|traordinary number of Apes, the greater part black as jet, &s;ome &s;mall ones black and white, very lepid: one of them addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, as it had been to crave &s;omething of that I was eat|ing, and thinking to fright him away, he was not &s;cared at all, as if he were accu&s;tomed to pa&s;&s;engers: I ca&s;t a piece of bread to him, which he took very mode&s;tly, and divided with his company and two young ones he had with him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apes.</NOTE> pre&s;ently there came three more, which &s;eemed to crave their &s;hare, I gave them &s;omething and they eat very quietly: but on a &s;udden part of our company aro&s;e and took their Armes, by rea&s;on of a heard of <HI>Fi&s;mans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;mans.</NOTE> or wilde dogs they di&s;covered, making towards us, which with one musket &s;hot were all &s;cared away: in our &s;ight they fed on gra&s;&s;e like &s;heep.</P>
<P>Proceeding on our way we met with abundance of other &s;orts of &s;trange animalls, as likewi&s;e of fruits, &s;ome whereof of growth much to be admired: &s;ome that bore ro&s;in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> that &s;mell like Ma&s;|tick; others a red berry, wherewith they dye carnation, which never fades, but dayly becomes more lively. Having thus tra|velled ten or twelve dayes through diver&s;ity of &s;oyles, meeting with many rivers, animalls, trees, and other things unknown to us, among&s;t others abundance of civit Cats, whereof they have &s;ome dome&s;ticall, which you may buy foure for one <HI>Pardai,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civit cats.</NOTE> but they are &s;tinking, and their dung &s;mells like Mans. At length we took to the River <HI>Jiame,</HI> and in three dayes came to the Village called <HI>Tanza,</HI> on the morrow to <HI>Canarane,</HI> a faire Town, rich and flouri&s;hing as any Town in <HI>India,</HI> the Capitall of a Kingdom, bearing the &s;ame name, confining ea&s;tward, on the Country of <HI>Tazatay,</HI> &s;outh on <HI>Carpa,</HI> and northward on <HI>Moantay,</HI> another great Kingdom. The Town is &s;eated betwixt two great rivers, <HI>Jiame</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> it is in circuit about foure leagues, magnificently built: in cu&s;tomes and conditions the people differ much from tho&s;e of <HI>Pegu,</HI> for they never go barefoot as the others do. Princes and Noble Men weare rich buskins, and &s;andalls &s;et with gold.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Canarane</HI> is Potent and Wealthy in Mines of gold and &s;ilver.

<P>When a King dies, they interr all his Trea&s;ure with him, and &s;weare his Succe&s;&s;or not to meddle with it.

<P>The u&s;ual money is called <HI>Canza,</HI> and all the <HI>Peguan</HI> is currant there, which the King &s;tamps in gold or &s;ilver, through the In|dies called <HI>Jamis,</HI> be&s;ides what every particular Prince coins of his own.

The King keeps abundance of &s;laves for his Elephants and &s;tables.

They go well apparelled and decent as may be, are very affable, dance, and &s;ing well; pre&s;erve a Merchants goods with great care, Lar|ceny among&s;t them being held a notorious ignominy.

<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> report many other things of them, but &s;o &s;trange and various, there is no great a&s;&s;urance, as that they breed but once in their life-time, and like Elephants, go two yeares with their young, and the like. A <HI>Bramin</HI> (an order Kings them&s;elves hold it an honour to be of) told me once with a prote&s;tation, laying his hand on the wreath of his order, that he was pre&s;ent with the King of <HI>Ca&s;ubi</HI> at the ta|king of one of the&s;e Unicorns, which was all white, and ve|ry old, the chops &s;o hanging down, all her teeth were &s;een, that &s;he was &s;o fierce in her owne defence, &s;he broke her horn among&s;t the boughs, that being taken, they brought her bound to the Kings Pallace, but being &s;o brui&s;ed with blowes, for having hurt the Kings Nephew, &s;he would not eat, and &s;o died within five dayes, which &s;hewes &s;he is a cho|lerick and &s;ullen bea&s;t,</P>

<P>The grain they call <HI>Taffin,</HI> is like our Millet, and hath a leaf like a reed, which the&s;e birds will in no &s;ort meddle with, whether for aver&s;ion, or other cau&s;e.

<P>One day as we went from <HI>Ca&s;ubi,</HI> to <HI>Tran&s;iana,</HI> with a numerous convoy of all nations, <HI>Moores, Gentiles, Malabates</HI> and others, be|cau&s;e there is no other travailing through the&s;e fore&s;ts, repleat with &s;uch bea&s;ts, and every water and river &s;wimming with <HI>Cro|codiles</HI> or <HI>Caymans,</HI> a youth who waited on <HI>de la Courb</HI> in his chamber, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> one of our company, of a daring &s;pirit, had a de&s;ire to &s;hoot at a Lyon he had &s;py'd, for which purpo&s;e he left the way &s;ome twenty paces, and had with him an <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Talma&s;&s;ac</HI> a per&s;on of courage likewi&s;e: a <HI>Bramin</HI> advi&s;ed them as &s;oon as they had given fire to make all ha&s;te with the be&s;t &s;peed of their hor&s;es for fear of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The Lyon lay along under a tree, and though he received two &s;hots at the &s;ame in&s;tant one in the head, the other in the left &s;houlder, notwith&s;tanding finding him&s;elf wounded, he &s;prung &s;o vigorou&s;ly after them, that though they made good ha&s;te, he overtook one of them in going two hundred paces, and caught his hor&s;e by the Crouper, which he killed like lightning, though his &s;trength was &s;pent. Poor <HI>Talma&s;&s;ac</HI> was &s;o a&s;tonied with a blow he gave with his head on the &s;ide, that he fell &s;ick, and we were fain to &s;end him back to <HI>Ca&s;ubi</HI> in a <HI>Palanquin</HI> or Litter with four <HI>Camalous</HI> or Porters, yet for a further mi&s;chief he was &s;tript by the way.

about two good leagues we met a man mounted on a Dro|medary coming down the Mountain, and a&s;king him if we had far to the next habitation, he an&s;wered we had but the tenth part of one Sun, as through the <HI>Indies</HI> they count Suns, that is, by dayes journies.

They likewi&s;e boa&s;t of Clove-Gilli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lowers, which I dare not affirm, be|cau&s;e I know it not.

<P>They have moreover, Mines of excellent &s;ilver, but &s;uch is their &s;loth, they had rather live from hand to mouth, then work; here is gotten the be&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Safron, and very excellent Sugar, which they order but very gro&s;&s;ely, becau&s;e they have not the perfect art to refine it; though neverthele&s;&s;e they make a great Trade of it. They have Melons of incredible bigne&s;&s;e, yellow, red, and white, much more delicate then <HI>Provence</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> hath.

<P>They have Dates of five &s;everall kindes, and other trees which yield them excellent drinks, be&s;ides fruits to eat, and &s;trings which they pull out to make <HI>Akpargates,</HI> or thread &s;hooes after the Spa|ni&s;h manner, which they call <HI>Pargas</HI> or <HI>Otayas:</HI> they have al&s;o thread from another tree called <HI>Langir,</HI> or <HI>Coatir</HI> in another lan|guage, whereof they make cloth as fine as &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Then from one certain nut they draw oyle &s;undry wayes, pre&s;|&s;ing what is within, and pouring thereon hot water, which makes an oyle like that of <HI>Almunds,</HI> or el&s;e pre&s;&s;ing a little kernell which growes within the nut, when 'tis ripe like that of a <HI>Pa&s;tique,</HI> or <HI>Pumpion</HI>; Likewi&s;e from a grain or nut which is in common Dates, they draw a very good oyle, and the &s;trong prickles which grow about the leaves &s;erve them for needles to few their &s;ayles, and the apparell of the poorer &s;ort; which needle they call <HI>Cambiza.</HI></P>
<P>As for the drinks they make of the&s;e trees, being drawne by di&s;tillation they are incorruptible, otherwi&s;e they grow &s;owre and dead in four and twenty houres; they make a certain compound of the juyce of <HI>Igname</HI> or <HI>Joucas,</HI> which in ta&s;te is like good <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and mixt with &s;ugar and cinamon, is a good and kindly nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this I&s;land take thought for nothing but how to live jovially, and which is admirable, in &s;o great a num|ber of people, you &s;ee neither beggers nor vagabonds, as in Eu|rope.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The occu|pations of the Inha|bitants of <HI>Madaga&s;|car.</HI></NOTE> They all live happily without injuring others; &s;ome con|tent with little, others will have more, and no man wants imploy|ment, if he will take paines.

<P>They live in perfect amity, &s;uch as if one man take fi&s;h, he parts freely with it to him that asks him. Some there are who addict them&s;elves to hunt wild bea&s;ts, whereby they get skins of price, as <HI>Ermins,</HI> the <HI>Girafe</HI> &s;triped with white and red, which breed in this I&s;le, with all &s;orts of wild creatures, as <HI>Elephants, Rhinoceros,</HI> which they call <HI>Couzan,</HI> and a certain &s;ort of A&s;&s;es, which are like the u&s;ual A&s;&s;es, being almo&s;t all dapled gray, and white or black, and bay; they will &s;uffer you to come clo&s;e to them, but if you touch them, though never &s;o gently, they &s;pring away with mo&s;t &s;tupendious leaps.</P>

<P>To conclude, the I&s;land is &s;o plentiful of cattle, that they have often given a fat &s;heep for a Counter, or a leafe of paper; and a Marriner told me for truth, that being at the point of <HI>Cape Salido,</HI> to take in fre&s;h water; an inhabitant of the Town of <HI>Antipara,</HI> gave him four Cowes for a &s;curvie piece of leather, he was about to throw into the Sea with his dead Ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>HAving left <HI>Bulgara,</HI> we run all along that &s;tretched forth coa&s;t of <HI>Ethiope,</HI> where we vi&s;ited <HI>Melindo, Monbaze, Quiloa, Mozambique, Cefala,</HI> and other Townes, for truck of our commo|dities.</P>

<P>There is a good Sea-port, &s;trong, and much frequented by the Indians, who drive a great trade in &s;pices, drugges, and precious &s;tones, which much enriches the place, and brings a great con|flux of people from <HI>Zanzbar, Penda, Agair,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Africa.</HI> There is gold, &s;ilver, precious &s;tones, and Ivory in great quantity. The country abounds in good fruit of all &s;orts, parti|cularly in Citrons and Oranges of prodigious bigne&s;&s;e, and of ex|cellent ta&s;te, whereof the rind is &s;weet, and good to eat.

<P>The People are of a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, contrary to other Mari|time places, where the natives are ordinarily mutinous, and liti|gious. We had there an Ho&s;t called <HI>France&s;co Co&s;mel,</HI> of comple|xion between black and white, as he were born of a Father black, and a Mother white, he gave us te&s;timonies of a generous &s;oule, and &s;eemed to be of good extraction.

He added far more, the particular &s;atisfaction he received after &s;o long a travell, in that the Prince cau&s;ed four Chri&s;tians their hateful enemies to be ma&s;&s;acred, and engaged in honour of their God to pray at the Temple five times the day, under pain of the &s;courge.</P>
<P>The King building a faith in this &s;orcerer, made an ordinance that all &s;hould yield obedience to this <HI>Mulila</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates, whom they named the <HI>Jubacumba.</HI></P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time the people pre&s;ented them&s;elves at their ce|remonies, but being ab&s;ent the &s;econd time, the&s;e impo&s;tor Prie&s;ts, coming forth, fell upon them with &s;courges made of Elephants hyde, and beat them mo&s;t rudely, per&s;evering in this har&s;h way of treatment, till on a day a young <HI>Portugues,</HI> called <HI>Franci&s;co Sanche,</HI> who lived in the Fort of <HI>Safala,</HI> being come to the town for trade, and to vi&s;it a Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e he had, a Merchants daughter, received &s;ome la&s;hes in the &s;treet from the&s;e magicians, whereupon being &s;en&s;ible of his injury, lets flye his cimeterre at one of them, and lays him dead on the ground, without much trouble, confiding in the Kings favour, to whom he had brought a pre&s;ent from the Go|vernour of the Fort <HI>Henrique Mendez,</HI> and they joyning in their defence, he killed four, and wounded four more, then mounted on hor&s;e, and went &s;afe off.</P>
<P>The King being told of it fell into laughter, and prai&s;ed the <HI>Portugues</HI> for his courage, which ingratiated him with his Mi&s;tris; &s;o as &s;he after married him.</P>
<P>True it is, this Prince had not long before put &s;ome Je&s;uits to death, but he made them ample &s;atisfaction, by putting to death all the Mahometans, who gave him &s;uch councell, whereupon the Fathers of <HI>Cochin</HI> being adverti&s;ed of it, &s;ent others pre&s;ently, who declared to the King the benefit they were to all mankind, in in&s;truction and &s;alvation of &s;ouls, and gain'd &s;o highly upon his grace, that be&s;ides other particular favours which he did them, he granted free liberty to his people to be converted, and em|brace the Chri&s;tian faith.

<P><PB N="203" REF="108">Poy&s;on is very common throughout the Empire, and at deare rates, there being &s;ome that is &s;old at a hundred Miticales, or Sequins the ounce; The rea&s;on &s;o much is u&s;ed, is, the rigour of the King, and his Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, who inflict &s;uch cruell pu|ni&s;hments upon Offenders.</P>
<P>For, no &s;ooner hath a per&s;on committed a Crime, but he is pu|ni&s;hed in the in&s;tant, and if the Crime requires the Offender &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended &s;ome dayes, to render his puni&s;hment more long and greivous, he is tyed to a tree, with &s;trong guards, there being no Pri&s;ons, as I &s;aid before; &s;o, as the Criminall &s;eeing no po&s;&s;i|ble e&s;cape, the be&s;t remedy is to poy&s;on him&s;elf, by a &s;peedy death to cut off the rigour of a long paine.</P>
<P>Nor will the Prince be clothed with any thing but what is made within his own Palace, for fear of poy&s;on. There are cer|tain trees called <HI>Co&s;coma,</HI> which beare fruit like the golden ap|ple, of violet &s;ent, which ta&s;tes well, but, being eaten in any quan|tity, purges &s;o violently, that it voids blood, and at la&s;t is mor|tall.

If one injures another without cau&s;e, he is cruelly ba&s;tina|do'd, as they are in <HI>Turky,</HI> where I have &s;een Judges them&s;elves, for that they have failed in Ju&s;tice, puni&s;hed in that manner.</P>
<P>They are laid naked upon the ground, and the Officer, or Exe|cutioner, is to beat them with a cord knotted, and buttond at the end, and when the Pre&s;ident gives the word, then he doth his Of|fice: having done, he gets up, puts on his clothes again, and gives thanks to the Judges, and Executioner, for their Ju&s;tice, without any di&s;grace for the matter, and returns to his function, as if no &s;uch thing had happened. This makes the Judges can|did in their &s;entences. The greate&s;t Lords and Magi&s;trates find the like from the King, as I ob&s;erved before, &s;peaking of <HI>Melnida.</HI> For, he hath them ca&s;tigated in his pre&s;ence privately, and then with in&s;tructions di&s;mi&s;&s;es to their charge. Ju&s;tice thus &s;e|verely executed, without exception of per&s;ons, pre&s;erves the Na|tion in firm Peace and Tranquillity, and gets the King as 'twere a Divine Adoration, &s;o really, that as he pa&s;&s;es thorough the &s;treets, the people praying for him, ca&s;t them&s;elves to the ground on their face, not pre&s;uming &s;o much as to look upon him.</P>

Of the&s;e &s;ons there were four principal, who&s;e names were <HI>Abga|rou, Adala, Corcut,</HI> and <HI>Gulman,</HI> who having &s;eap'd &s;ome enter|pri&s;es upon their per&s;ons, united them&s;elves again&s;t their other brothers, of whom they put to death as many as they could lay hold on, the re&s;t &s;aved them&s;elves in &s;everal places, flying the cruelty of tho&s;e who proclaimed Offices and places of tru&s;t to who&s;oever brought in their heads. During this &s;tate of things, here raged great warres, and many bloody encounters pa&s;&s;ed, wherein two of the four brothers payed their lives, and there re|mained only <HI>Corgut</HI> and <HI>Gulman,</HI> who at la&s;t reconciled with a general peace, and lived in great amity, copartners in the royalty, &s;o as after the modell of <HI>Eteocles</HI> and <HI>Polinice,</HI> tho&s;e ancient Kings of <HI>Thebes,</HI> each governed &s;ix moneths by turns. This la&s;ted for a time, till <HI>Corcut</HI> took to wife the Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Dafila,</HI> an ambitious Lady, who &s;ix moneths after her nuptials, per&s;waded her con|&s;ort to murther his brother, and reign without a partner, which was done accordingly, calling him to Court under pretence of communicating &s;ome affaires of con&s;equence, and &s;o he became &s;ole King, and reigned thirteen years, till an Uncle of his called <HI>Nahi,</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="109">
in revenge, put both him, his wife, children, and all his allies to death, to the great content of the people, for the hatred he bore to this unfortunate Fratricide. Then they imagined an ancient Prophecy which they kept among&s;t them, was accompli&s;hed: <HI>That the Lamb &s;hould kill both the Wolfe and his wife:</HI> She was called <HI>Gildada,</HI> and was drowned. But the King of <HI>Dafila</HI> incen&s;ed with the death of his daughter and Son-in-law, brought a mo&s;t cruell warre upon the new King <HI>Nahi,</HI> wherein fell numbers on both &s;ides. In the mean while, among&s;t the Princes who had &s;cap'd the truculent hands of their brothers, one there was who &s;trayed far off, and got into the kingdome of <HI>Deli,</HI> where contenting him|&s;elf to live meanly as an unknown private per&s;on, he purcha&s;ed a &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for his livelihood, and betook him&s;elf to labour: where taking a wife, &s;he brought him a &s;on they called <HI>Alfondi</HI>; who at &s;even or eight years of age, gave the world great hopes of his per&s;on, for the excellent parts which began to bud in him, and which made him amiable to all men; in &s;o much that ad|dicting him&s;elfe to the words, as yeares encrea&s;ed his vi|gour, he did wonders in the &s;laying of Lions, Beares, Ti|gars, and other furious bea&s;ts, and in all his actions appeared no|thing but what was great and noble; in&s;omuch as hearing &s;poken on day how &s;trenuous a war there raged betwixt <HI>Tahachi</HI> his un|known great Uncle, and the King of <HI>Dafila,</HI> he was tran&s;ported with emulation to be a Party, and being furni&s;hed with a good hor&s;e and Arms, with the &s;ociety of a Troop of brave young men, he ha&s;ted to tho&s;e parts, where, in the &s;ervice of <HI>Tahachi,</HI> he &s;oon gave proofe of his Courage, and abilities in warr; but, among&s;t others, on one &s;ignall occa&s;ion which pre&s;ented it &s;elfe, where, with a &s;mall party of Souldiers, he defeated the much more numerous Enemy; and the King of <HI>Dafila</HI> admiring his Valour, endeavou|red under-hand to win him to his &s;ide, by offering a Daughter of his in Marriage, with a Province, which he had taken from <HI>Ta|hachi.</HI> To which <HI>Afondi</HI> &s;eeming to give eare, dexterou&s;ly made u&s;e of the opportunity, to &s;eize upon the Towne of <HI>Ama|zen,</HI> a mo&s;t con&s;iderable place, which exceedingly plea&s;ed <HI>Tahachi,</HI> and heightned his affection to him, feeling, I know not what &s;ecret motion in his &s;oul, which pu&s;hed him on to this Dearne&s;&s;e, without any apprehen&s;ion that he was his Nephew; but, Good blood, as they &s;ay, cannot di&s;&s;emble. At length, <HI>Alfondi,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted with his Uncles Forces, did &s;uch Atcheivements and Exploits, that within &s;ix Months, he delivered the Empire <HI>Zanzibar</HI> from the oppre&s;&s;i|on of the Enemy, which obliged <HI>Tahachi</HI> for recompen&s;e, to give him one of his Daughters in Marriage, without any deep|er knowledg of him, then his Heroick Actions, and Noble A&s;|pect; forall the Orientall and Meridionall Princes, regard more the Mind, and Phy&s;iognomy of a Man, then they do the extracti|on, or Nobility of Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="110"><HI>Alfondi</HI> rai&s;ed to &s;o high a degree, reflects upon his father the hone&s;t labourer, whom he omitted not to &s;end for, who being arrived, and having declared who he was, begat an unparalleld joy in <HI>Tabochi</HI> and his whole kingdome, every one &s;hedding teares for his di&s;covery, rendring prai&s;e to God, and his ju&s;t pro|vidence for reducing things to &s;o unhoped for a point, and after &s;o many years repo&s;ing the inheritance on him, to whom of right it appertained.

This Prince had reigned forty &s;even yeares, when he arrived in the countrey.</P>
<P>Before I conclude my di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Tahachi,</HI> and his condition, I &s;hall not omit another &s;tory, which te&s;tifies the &s;ingular ju&s;tice he di&s;pen&s;es with indifferency to all his &s;ubjects. He had con&s;ti|tuted in the Province of <HI>Quame</HI> one <HI>Abdalami,</HI> a per&s;on of high quality, his confident, a gallant Cavalier, and one who had done mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ervices in the war with the King of <HI>Dafila</HI>; but being inclined to avarice, and hord up wealth, he played the Tyrant, and &s;acked the country to &s;atiate his own humour, and the de|&s;ires of &s;ome women he gave entertainment to: When <HI>Tahachi</HI> was informed thereof, he was much di&s;plea&s;ed, for 'twas his rule to maintain equal ju&s;tice, peace and freedome among&s;t his &s;ub|jects: Notwith&s;tanding he concealed his re&s;entments for a while, giving way to his proceedings as well for his great &s;ervices, as for that he had be&s;towed on him a kin&s;woman to wife, called <HI>Abia|&s;inda,</HI> by whom he had children. He admoni&s;hed him often by letter, to bear him&s;elfe more temperately, but perceiving his &s;mall regard, by the con&s;tant intru&s;ion of complaints that came to him, he &s;ent expre&s;&s;e command that he &s;hould repaire immedi|ately to Court to give account of his actions upon pain of death, and being proclaimed rebell, and guilty of his trea&s;on. <HI>Abdalami</HI> under&s;tanding his own wealth and power, &s;lighted this &s;ummons, and fortified him&s;elf in the holds of his Government. Whereupon the King cau&s;ed his wife and children to be apprehended and brought pri&s;oners to his city royall. This Prince&s;&s;e with her be&s;t art excu&s;ed her hu&s;band, be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ties mercy towards him, for his former &s;ervices, adding withall that the&s;e complaints, were but a calumny rai&s;ed by the malice of his enemies. The King covering his re&s;entments, mildely an&s;wered her, that &s;he &s;hould only procure her hu&s;band to come to Court, but &s;he fear|ing to bring his per&s;on in danger, thought be&s;t only to advi&s;e him
<PB N="207" REF="110">
to &s;end a certain Casket of rings, and all &s;orts of rich jewels for a pre&s;ent to the Queen, and by that means work his peace: This he did, and &s;he having pre&s;ented it, the Queen &s;hewed them to the King, who wondred at &s;o great a trea&s;ure, where among&s;t others were five hundred pearles, each being a Miticale or Crown and half in weight, be&s;ides many other jewels of value, &s;ufficient to buy a kingdome. 'Twas much affliction to the Prince to &s;ee &s;uch trea&s;ures gotten at the price of his peoples blood, and then he commanded the Prince&s;&s;e his kin&s;woman to bring her hu&s;band to Court by a day appointed, or he would make feel the weight of his di&s;plea&s;ure. Poor <HI>Abdalami</HI> was amazed at the news, and fearing not without cau&s;e, the Kings incen&s;ement, fai|led not to come accordingly; and without calling on his wife and children, went &s;trait to the Palace, where having &s;ounded the Trum|pet according to the cu&s;tome, as I ob&s;erved before; he unclothed him&s;elf, and &s;itting on the ground &s;tark naked, only a linnen cloth before his concealed parts, he attended in this manner the mercy of the King: whereof notice being brought to his Lady, &s;he with her children di&s;robed in like manner, went to the Palace gate, and there &s;eated them&s;elves on the ground by him, with each a great &s;tone on their head.</P>
<P>The Queen e&s;pying them from her window, in this deplora|ble condition, moved with compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hewed them to the King, who gave order they &s;hould be bidden to reve&s;t them&s;elves, go back to their lodgings, and there attend his further plea&s;ure; &s;o they did, trembling with expectation of the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Many advi&s;ed <HI>Abdalami</HI> to make e&s;cape, and his wife her &s;elf was of that opinion; but he would not be per&s;waded, his &s;ervices rai&s;ing him a confidence of the Kings clemency. Now moreover to compleat his calamity, when the King began to relent, the &s;uits and &s;upplications which came on all &s;ides in his behalf, one of the principal per&s;ons in the Court called <HI>I&s;man,</HI> charges him with a new crime, complaining to the King that he had &s;educed &amp; debauched a daughter of his, for which he craves ju&s;tice, which &s;u&s;pended the Kings clemency, re&s;olving to examine the truth of the matter, which proved, in fine, to be but a meer &s;uppo&s;all.</P>
<P>For it was mo&s;t true, that <HI>Abdalami</HI> being a Prince of an amia|ble form and beauty, and of high e&s;teem for his valour, this Lords daughter had &s;o impetuous a Love-pa&s;&s;ion for him, that &s;he fell &s;ick to death, and <HI>Abdalamies</HI> Lady vi&s;iting her as a friend, ob&s;er|ved &s;he fell on weeping as oft as &s;he beheld her, whereupon one day &s;he importuned to know the rea&s;on, conjuring her to &s;peak freely if &s;he had in any thing offended her, prote&s;ting &s;he was rea|dy to make her as ample &s;atisfaction, as &s;he could de&s;ire. The poor Lady confounded with &s;hame, was &s;ometime before &s;he could form her an&s;wer, but at length love taking place of Virgin-mode&s;ty, &s;he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed the eau&s;e of her di&s;temper,

with &s;uch abundance of tears, &s;ighs, and &s;upplications of pardon for the affront &s;he offered her, that the other was moved to &s;uch tenderne&s;&s;e, &s;he promi&s;ed her notwithanding one &s;o near and dear to her as a hu&s;band was aimed at; neverthele&s;&s;e in pity of her violent pa&s;&s;ion, which de&s;erved &s;ome pardon, &s;he would contri|bute what was po&s;&s;ible to her reliefe; hereupon the young Lady told her, how &s;he had pre&s;ented by her bond-maid a chain of pearl and rubies to her hu&s;band, with reque&s;t that he would wear them for her &s;ake, which he accepted as well for the value of the thing, as for that the &s;lave was a gay and pretty girle, to whom he gave a pair of pendants of <HI>Fau&s;er</HI> diamonds, of an Olive figure; but for the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, he returned her a bare meagar thanks, with|out further acknowledgement, which the &s;lave notwith&s;tanding di&s;&s;embled, making her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e believe he had a &s;trong affection for her, and for love of her, wore her favour: and &s;o this &s;lave treated her with the&s;e fictions, in hope to give &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion to the violence of her pa&s;&s;ion, and twas &s;he who fir&s;t embarked her in the&s;e amorous follies.</P>
<P>The Lady was amazed at the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and remembred the chain, becau&s;e her hu&s;band had given it to her &s;elf, without ac|quainting her where he had it.</P>
<P>Now being de&s;irous to invert &s;ome cure for her malady, though a mo&s;t perfect reciprocal affection animated both her hu&s;band and &s;elf, notwith&s;tanding compa&s;&s;ion forced her inclinations to offer her a nights concubitation with her hu&s;band; which &s;o reviv'd this Dam&s;ells heart, that immediately &s;he aro&s;e from her bed, and in few dayes was perfectly recover'd. To compa&s;&s;e this with|out her husbands di&s;covery, &s;he con&s;ulted both with the daughter, and the Lady her Mother, who was likewi&s;e of the Party; &s;o, as re|turning home, &s;he told her husband &s;he found &s;ome unu&s;uall di|&s;temper in the &s;tate of health, and entreated him he would forbear her enjoyments for &s;ome nights, which expir'd <HI>Abdalami</HI> pa&s;&s;ionate for her commpany: &s;he, to heighten his flame, &s;hewed &s;ome unwillingne&s;s, till pre&s;&s;ing her with importunity, &s;he con|&s;ented for the en&s;uing night, upon condition that for that night he &s;hould not &s;peak a word to her. Being thus agreed, &s;he gives the Lady notice to be ready at the houre appointed, &s;o being con|veyed into the wives roome, &s;he conceived with child, without the husbands knowledge of the juggle. Meanwhile, time ma|king the Father perceive the growth of his daughter, and under|&s;tanding by her acknowledgment, who&s;e act it was, fired with rage, accompanied with his Allies and Relations, without delay he re|paires to the King, with a violent complaint of this injury, as I &s;aid before. Hereupon <HI>Tahachi</HI> enters into a deep con&s;ideration of the&s;e two Per&s;ons, whereof the one was his Kin&s;man, and of high de&s;erts for his &s;ervices, the other was Lord of the Pro|vince of <HI>E&s;&s;en,</HI> between <HI>Dafila</HI> and <HI>Ganfilira,</HI> below <HI>Barnaga&s;&s;o,</HI>

heretofore tributary to the great <HI>Negus,</HI> but being not inclined to be a Chri&s;tian him&s;elf, nor be &s;ubject to a Chri&s;tian King, had put him&s;elf voluntarily under the dominion of <HI>Tahachi</HI> an Infidel. In conclu&s;ion the King re&s;olved to have the matter examined, and to pronounce Ju&s;tice as the cau&s;e merited. And hereupon notice was given to <HI>Abdalami</HI> of the accu&s;ation, wherein being con&s;cious of his own innocence, he was much &s;atisfied that the Kings anger lay on that &s;ide, and conferring with his Lady, told her he admired the impudence of that Lord, to accu&s;e him of a a thing he was &s;o ignorant of, and much more at the in&s;olency of his daughter, that laid two ba&s;tards to his charge: The Lady &s;miled, as who &s;hould &s;ay it may be true, whereupon as he was about to make oaths and prote&s;tations to the contrary &s;he ac|knowledged and related the whole to him, and how the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e was brought to pa&s;&s;e by her invention, whereat he was &s;trangely amazed, admiring his Ladies goodne&s;&s;e, that was &s;o charitable to her own injury. In this conjuncture, the King gave licence to Lord <HI>I&s;man</HI> to take revenge of <HI>Abdalami</HI> in what &s;ort he could, under his a&s;&s;ured grace; &s;o he now layes wait for all occa&s;ions to effect it, and to &s;urpri&s;e him on the water as he went to take the Ayre, for the town of <HI>Zanzibar,</HI> or <HI>Zanguebar,</HI> is compleatly encir|cled with water, which runs both within and without, and almo&s;t every inhabitant hath his <HI>Almady</HI> or flat boat, wherein they recre|ate upon the Lake. But <HI>Abdalami,</HI> whether adverti&s;ed, or &s;u&s;|pecting it, &s;tood upon his con&s;tant guard, &s;o as pa&s;&s;ing one day upon the water, before the windowes of the Palace-royall, that the King might have the pro&s;pect, if any one attacked him, <HI>I&s;man</HI> comes up with his boats to a&s;&s;ault his enemy, who was not un|provided: then there &s;ucceeded a fierce combat between them, where <HI>Abdalami</HI> did miracles in his own defence; &s;o effectually, that he put the adver&s;e barks to flight, to the extraordinary de|light of the King. In the mean while Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Aba&s;inda</HI> waits up|on the Queen, and recounts to her the plain truth of the my&s;tery, which being told the King, he &s;ent to <HI>I&s;man</HI> to let him know, that if the ca&s;e were found &s;uch as he apprehended, he would lay the head of <HI>Abdalami</HI> in his hands, to carry into his own country; whereof, though &s;pight &amp; &s;hame of his defeat had made him their Bedfellow, and he had not &s;tirr'd forth of twenty dayes; he was &s;o &s;ati&s;ised, he came immediately to the King, who remitting the matter to Councell, 'twas concluded that the Mother and daugh|ter &s;hould be brought to Court, to an&s;wer what &s;hould be deman|ded of them. At the &s;ame time the King made a per&s;onall vi&s;it to <HI>Abdalami,</HI> who upon this vouch&s;afed de&s;cent to come thus alone to his hou&s;e, conceived &s;ome hopes of his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and ca&s;ting him&s;elf at his feet, &s;aid he held him&s;elf over happy in the favour his Prince had done him, and for ever after he &s;hould e&s;teem it an honour to lay down his life for his &s;ervice. The King cau&s;ing him

to ri&s;e, embraced him, a&s;&s;uring him of pardon for what was pa&s;s'd, for which he and his Lady rendring humble thanks, attended him to his Pallace. Three dayes after, the Mother and her daughter arrived in their <HI>Pelanquins,</HI> born on their &s;laves &s;houlders, then the Councell being &s;ate, three <HI>Cal&s;ena</HI> or Officers were &s;ent for <HI>Abdalami,</HI> as who under&s;tood not the matter looking on him as a lo&s;t per&s;on, and <HI>I&s;man</HI> for his part conceiving he dur&s;t not appear, but rather tru&s;t to flight, had laid &s;ouldiers to wait and intercept him on the way. But they were &s;trangely amazed when they &s;aw him appear at the Palace in his <HI>Talia Ma&s;&s;ara,</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> mantle down to the foot, under a Ca&s;&s;ock, a figur'd cloth of gold, cove|red with a white Cipre&s;&s;e in te&s;timony of his innocence, and about his head a cord made of &s;mall reeds according to cu&s;tome, in te|&s;timony of &s;elf-puni&s;hment, if he were found guilty. The Judges then examined both parties, and finding they could produce no &s;ufficient evidence, they took the Mother and daughter apart, and learning from their mouthes the pure and reall truth, they thought fit to have Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Abia&s;inda</HI> to be brought, and &s;ince 'twas through her charity this affair was con&s;ented to and contrived, 'twas but rea&s;on &s;he &s;hould &s;peak her opinion: Then placing her on the Bench with the Judges, <HI>Abdalami</HI> was called forth, who being a&s;ked if he would &s;tand to what &s;entence his Lady &s;hould pronounce, an&s;wered, Yea mo&s;t willingly: then rai&s;ing her voyce, &s;he pronounced, that &s;ince <HI>Alberane</HI> had &s;o firm an affection to her hu&s;band, and had born for him two lovely children, by the good favour and permi&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty, &s;he condemned him to e&s;pou&s;e her pre&s;ently, and &s;he would receive her for her faithful compani|on. The judgment was admired by the whole A&s;&s;embly, and the Father being asked if he held this Award &s;ufficient reparation of his honour, was &s;o confounded with the unfolding of what he was before kept ignorant, he knew not what to &s;ay, but the King pre&s;&s;ing his re&s;olution, in te&s;timony of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he ca&s;t him&s;elf on the earth, &s;aying, If <HI>Abdalami</HI> would honour him with marry|ing his daughter, he would give with her the Province of <HI>A&s;&s;en,</HI> with the mines, and three&s;core carriages of fine gold, which he had gotten that pre&s;ent year. The bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;o well accommo|modated, the King gave order for great rejoycings, with &s;olemn fea&s;tings, and open court for fifteen dayes, for all Princes and Lords of his Train. The Councell would have had the moity of this trea&s;ure di&s;pen&s;ed, for &s;atisfaction to the complaining province of <HI>Zuamin,</HI> but the King oppo&s;ed, content only to abridge him of the Crown rights for five yeares, which amounted to much more then all that trea&s;ure: which was done accordingly, to the content of all, and the&s;e two Ladies with &s;incere affection, lived dear companions in peace and unity.</P>

<P>The people of the&s;e kingdomes when they bring their <HI>Gibre</HI> or tribute to the Prince, They have wound a rope about their head, and proclaim with a loud voice, The Revenue of &s;uch a Pro|vince, My Lord I am here pre&s;ent.

For the kingdom of <HI>Bagamidri</HI> it reaches to the <HI>Tro|pick,</HI> watered by <HI>Zuama,</HI> called by the inhabitants <HI>Zimbada,</HI> which cro&s;&s;es the de&s;erts of <HI>Manica,</HI> where are di&s;mal Mountains, and goes til it ingulphs it &s;elf in the Oriental and Meridian &s;ea, com|po&s;ing a mo&s;t commodious &s;hore, where ve&s;&s;els take in fre&s;h-water and fuel. Here are abundance of wild goats, and &s;mall Buls and Cows &s;o fierce, that he mu&s;t be very &s;kilfull that takes them, they have little horns which grow but &s;kin-deep, moo|ving them as their ears, as I ob&s;erved in another place. This River of <HI>Zuama</HI> is by the <HI>Portugalls</HI> called, <HI>Rio del Spiritu &s;ancto,</HI> for the content they receive who &s;aile upon it.</P>
<P>Moreover, in pa&s;&s;ing or bathing in this River, there ought great caution to be had, and to be well arm'd again&s;t the Cro|codiles, which are here in great numbers: nor is the danger on land much le&s;&s;e, for the Tigars, of which there are great Troupes, and will very &s;awcily di&s;mount you, either from Hor&s;e or Mule.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Man&s;ion of <HI>Pre&s;te John,</HI> and his Ju&s;tice. A History upon this &s;ubject.</HEAD>
<P>BEing at <HI>Bagamidri,</HI> &s;ome of us more curious then the re&s;t of our company, agreed to go &s;ee the Court of the Grand <HI>Negus,</HI> or King of the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ins</HI>; and to this purpo&s;e leaving them that had no &s;uch de&s;ire we took a &s;ide-way towards the towns <HI>Barra,</HI> and <HI>Barua,</HI> where we were told the Prince mo&s;t commonly re&s;ided: Following on this road, and having cro&s;&s;ed many Provinces and Kingdomes, at length we arrived at <HI>Barra</HI> the chief town of the Country, where we found a numerous multitude of people living under Tents, to the number of ten thou&s;and, or more. Among&s;t the&s;e there was one covered with white cloth con&s;picuous above the re&s;t, with twelve gates of marvellous largene&s;&s;e belonging to it. We Inn'd in an <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI> tent, who obliged us with curte&s;ies, and while meat was making ready, they brought us in an oxe horne honied wine, whereof we drunk. Not long after, we percei|ved upon the way, a troop diver&s;ly armed with twelve <HI>&V;gandes</HI> or Trumpets before them; then came a Prince mounted on a black and white Elephant, which is a great rarity, accom|panied with four Noble-men, who bore over him a Canopy of gray damask. Being advanced near the Kings tent, he di&s;moun|ted and pre&s;ently was attended with a numerous and honourable train. Next with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he &s;uffered his garments to be taken off; they were of &s;ilk, interwoven with gold, and em|broydered with pearles of exceeding greatne&s;&s;e: He was a po|tent Prince, who having received injury from another King, came to &s;eek ju&s;tice at his Maje&s;ties hands. 'Twas not for want of power to take revenge him&s;elf, but he would &s;hew this defe|rence to the King, who inflicts mo&s;t &s;everely on all tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aranuhi.</NOTE> Now this Prince, called <HI>Aranuhi,</HI> &s;tript off his gorgious habilliments, ca&s;t over him a Lions skin, which in the Sove|raigns pre&s;ence all are obliged to weare, with a large &s;hirt of &s;ilk trailing on the ground. Being come before the Pa|lace, the Trumpets began in a dolefull &s;ound, and the King having notice, gave order he &s;hould enter; for this Prince in times pa&s;t had done famous military &s;ervices, then ca&s;ting him&s;elf on the ground, framed his complaint, that the other King his enemy had violently carried away his wife, with a daughter which he had heretofore refu&s;ed him, intending to marry her to another a greater Prince then he, and had taken be&s;ides 40. <HI>Quintalls</HI> of gold.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hundred weight.</NOTE> Upon this complaint the <HI>Negus</HI> immediately di&s;patched a <HI>Cal&s;cena</HI> to &s;ummon the Prince offen|der,
<PB N="221" REF="117">
whom he met upon the road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cal&s;cenas, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">este J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hns <HI>me&s;|&s;engers.</HI> Aluaca. <HI>141.</HI></NOTE> ha&s;ting to Court to clear him|&s;elf of the accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>Then in&s;tantly the Prince complaynant was called a&s;ide, reve|&s;ted with a rich habit given him by the <HI>Negus,</HI> with a hat of more then u&s;uall largene&s;&s;e, according to the cu&s;tome. When the latter was arrived and di&s;robed as the former, and mantled with a Lions &s;kin, he took a &s;tone, carried for him by a Gentleman to the Palace gate, and having cau&s;ed the Trumpets &s;ound, he could not be admitted; but for above two houres waited in this po|&s;ture, taken for a bad omen among&s;t them, till a &s;lave brought or|ders he &s;hould repair to his lodgings, and attend there till he were called for. Some dayes pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, before any commands came from the <HI>Negus,</HI> then having laid down his appa|rell, and put on the Lions &s;kin, he &s;eated him&s;elf on the ground with a heavie &s;tone upon his head, as a criminall, till the <HI>Alica&s;&s;in</HI> or Steward of hou&s;hold came, who cau&s;ed him to rea&s;&s;ume his apparell, which put him in &s;ome hope of grace. This Officer conducting him by the hand, brought him before his Maje&s;ty in &s;tate, under a rich Canopy, with a Curtain of &s;ilk of the &s;ame colour as the Canopy, &s;creening his face, then cryed aloud; <HI>Mo&s;t mighty Emperour, I bring thee here this Prince thy &s;ervant, and tri|butary according to thy command.</HI> At that time the King was com|plementing a Prince&s;&s;e wife to the <HI>Tigraian</HI> King, arrived lately at Court in a very plain habit of frized Cottons. The Prince no &s;ooner entered, but he ca&s;t him&s;elf on the ground, the complainant who was &s;ummoned being pre&s;ent, of whom the <HI>Negus</HI> demanded what he had to object again&s;t this per&s;on; the other an&s;wered, that this Prince of <HI>Jauas</HI> had &s;tolne away his daughter, and a great quan|tity of fined gold. To which the <HI>Negus</HI> commanded the Defen|dant to make an&s;wer, and deliver the very truth; who fir&s;t putting his hand to the ground, then laying it on his head, with eyes lift|ed to heaven, a &s;ad pale countenance, fell on his knees, not pre|&s;uming to turn an eye towards the Kings face, who is alwayes &s;creen'd, and an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t excel&s;e and redoubted Sir, mo&s;t true it is, I &s;ent to re|que&s;t this Prince for his daughter <HI>Adila</HI> in mariage, and being de|nied without further in&s;tance I de&s;i&s;ted, content to &s;eek another of my own degree. But not long after, the Queen her mother ac|companied with many of her Alliance brought her to me, toge|ther with gold, which &s;he told me was of her own proper trea&s;u|ry, and not her hu&s;bands, and thereupon gave me both rea&s;on and licen&s;e to marry her, and that with her own free mind and con&s;ent, without the lea&s;t violence impo&s;ed upon her, whom I love and honour more then the whole world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negus</HI> having then taken the matter into con&s;ideration, told Prince <HI>Aranuhi,</HI> he found not the other &s;o guilty as was pretend|ed; that his &s;entence was, he for his part &s;hould repay the gold
<PB N="222" REF="118">
doubled, that the Prince&s;&s;es, his wife, and daughter &s;hould be bor'd through the lips, and confin'd during plea&s;ure, to what place he &s;hould appoint. The Prince of <HI>Jauas</HI> to this &s;entence dur&s;t make no reply further, then to de&s;ire time for payment: two moneths was allowed him, and immediately Commi&s;&s;ioners were di&s;patched to &s;ee the Arre&s;t of the Court executed, nor did either of the Princes quit the Court till the King bad them retire. But in this conjuncture, the Prince&s;&s;e of <HI>Tigremahon,</HI> moved with compa&s;&s;ion for the condemned young Lady, ca&s;ting her &s;elfe at the <HI>Negus</HI> feet, be&s;ought him, that for a &s;ingular grace and fa|vour to her, he would vouch&s;afe the young Lady might continue with her hu&s;band; and the Queen having applyed her prevalency to <HI>Aranubi</HI> for his con&s;ent, by the mediation of the&s;e two Ladies, all was ended in peace, and the two Princes embraced as friends and Allies. Mean while the Commi&s;&s;aries ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed, had already done execution upon the mother, and had likewi&s;e on the daughter, but that &s;he made a &s;ea&s;onable e&s;cape, to the joy of the whole Court, and the <HI>Negus</HI> cau&s;ing them to come to Court, would have the Nuptialls &s;olemnized there with all &s;orts of rejoycing, fea&s;ts, and combats of &s;avage bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Then certain Lords of the Court with the Kings Si&s;ter were &s;ent to the Sea-&s;ide to bring the Ladies, who being arrived, covered with a white linnen cloth, and bare-footed, ca&s;t them&s;elves on the ground before the King and the Father. At that time the King wore a Crown of &s;ilver for &s;ome my&s;tery which I could not learn by any enquiry I could make, and the trea&s;ure and jewels being brought, were di&s;tributed by the Father to his two children, and the King in token of his favour and indulgement relea&s;ed to Prince <HI>Aranubi</HI> all rights of Signeurie, with letters Patents of free and ab&s;olute Principality.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Combats at this &s;olemnity, one was of a white &s;haggie Ape put within an inclo&s;ed li&s;t, with a Serpent that had &s;ix wings, and was 14. foot in length. The Ape was armed with a wooden helmet, having a pike on the top exceeding &s;harp, and his body mailed with leather, liquored, and made fit, &s;o as he could u&s;e his teeth at plea&s;ure, the li&s;ts were rounded with painted cloth, with pieces of timber, and cords hard &s;traind, un|der which the Ape might &s;hift when he was hard pre&s;&s;ed upon, he made mo&s;t horrible faces when the Serpent came to a&s;&s;ault him, who rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon little feet like a Goo&s;es. Next was brought in an Ape of extraordinary &s;ize, armed with &s;ilvered Pa&s;te-board, mounted upon a great &s;heep, with a &s;mall lance, again&s;t a bea&s;t they call a <HI>Chilacou,</HI> like a wolf, who&s;e de&s;ign was to attack the Pal|frey, not the Cavalier, who during the conflict, fretted, and made mouthes in a &s;trange manner; at length they were parted.</P>
<P>After them was brought in a &s;mall Lion of a brave courage, who finding nothing to combat, laid him down along, but he no
<PB N="223" REF="118">
&s;ooner &s;aw a Creature called a <HI>Bachuro</HI> enter, arm'd with &s;cales, but with a loud roar, he nimbly flew upon him; for a good hour the fight la&s;ted, with terrible a&s;&s;aults on both &s;ides, till at la&s;t the Lion had the day, &s;trangled his foe and eat him, for the fle&s;h is ex|ceeding good.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Cheger,</HI> or Elephant with the <HI>Rhinocerot,</HI> which was a mo&s;t furious combat, but of little delight, becau&s;e for their bulk and weight, they could &s;hew but little agility or motion. Then was brought in play another &s;ort of Elephant, called by the <HI>Indians</HI> a <HI>Gachias,</HI> and again&s;t him four dogs of exceeding greatne&s;&s;e, of which at the very fir&s;t bout he kil'd one: The fiercene&s;&s;e of the bea&s;ts made this fight of much recreation. Next was a Crocodile and a Tigar, who treated each other very rudely. After them two great Dogs again&s;t a <HI>Targout,</HI> a kind of wolf, but much different from ours, 'twas a bloudy combat, where one of the dogs was kil'd, and the <HI>Targout</HI> hurt.</P>
<P>So this day was concluded with the combats, for other dayes there were other Triumphs, which I omit, to avoid prolix|itie.</P>
<P>This is all of remark which happened at Court, while we &s;taid at <HI>Barra,</HI> which I thought fit to recount, for information of the nature and manners of the people.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed &s;omething the longer at <HI>Barra,</HI> in expectation to &s;ee his Maje&s;ty the <HI>Negus</HI> who was &s;uddenly to come thither, and be|cau&s;e he had not been there of a long time, a magnificent entrance was prepared for him.</P>

<P>Here the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour arriv'd, of whom I &s;poke, with a train of twenty men, all mounted upon Mules; having &s;taid, as they told us, three months, at the famous mona&s;tery of the Vi&s;ion in the Country of <HI>Bamazaz</HI> towards the red &s;ea, where report goes are 2000. religious gray-Friers, who live in great au|&s;terity without want either of victuals or habit. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to receive audience of the <HI>Negus,</HI> but was deferr'd to another time; by rea&s;on his Maje&s;ty having &s;taid &s;ome dayes at <HI>Barra,</HI> was con&s;trained to depart that night to go towards <HI>Sacouon</HI> three leagues from thence, two dayes march for the Army, which moves not above three or four miles a day: and here we &s;aw the order of the Armies march.</P>

Then the officers and &s;ervants of the kitchin, about three thou&s;and, who carried the kings fare in ba&s;kets, and his drink in &s;mall barrels marked and &s;ealed: next followed a great number of hor&s;es, mules, elephants, <HI>Al&s;inges,</HI> and other kinds of bea&s;ts with carri|age. Among&s;t others there were four Lions, as tall as mules, un|der one mans charge, who never ceas'd raving and rating after them, to keep them from &s;traying from their company: They were gentle and tame as &s;heep; and by the way, 'tis a &s;trange thing to &s;ee the&s;e bea&s;ts feed; their keeper to &s;hew us a rarity, hung up a joynt of mutton, upon the wall of the &s;table or den, all the four gaz'd upon it, and then lay down, as knowing their &s;hare was in it: afterwards the fir&s;t that was hungry came, and at two or three mounts &amp; active leaps &s;pear-high, fetches down the piece of meat. But after this train of &s;even or eight thou&s;and head was pa&s;t, came 12. or 1500.

La&s;tly came twelve or fifteen thou&s;and Mu&s;queteers upon the wings, as 'twere in the form of a half moon, carrying their guns &s;trait upright; cimeters they had, and wore a very large cap or hood, which they folded up, and let hang upon their &s;houl|ders,

<P>Before this En&s;igne march about fifty Prie&s;ts &s;inging P&s;almes, and Hymnes, and four in Pontifical robes, who carry a hollowed &s;tone large and &s;quare, which they call the <HI>Tabuco,</HI> which they u&s;e when they celebrate Ma&s;&s;e before the <HI>Negus:</HI> before it ve&s;ted as the four are, marches another who going backward,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tabuto</HI> the altar &s;tone.</NOTE> incences the &s;tone: then followes the Standart, and &s;ome five hundred gentlemen of quality, all on hor&s;e-back, and clad in large white &s;hirts of &s;ilk, and plaited like a Chanons Surplice. One part of this company they call <HI>Cal&s;ena,</HI> who are exempt Officers in readi|ne&s;&s;e to execute the Kings commands. After this attended with Mu&s;ick and Hoboyes, appears a Canopy high exalted, and before it one whom they call <HI>Licadona</HI> mounted on an Elephant, bearing in his hand a lump of gold or &s;ilver guilt, who &s;eemed to be the chief of this mu&s;ick. Four Princes, upon four of the highe&s;t Elephants can be gotten, bear the Queens Canopy, plainly ha|bited with Lions &s;kins over their &s;hirts, and broad hats on their heads: the Queen her &s;elf's in a Littar, and with her com|monly a little childe for her recreation, accompanied with a nu|merous train of Littars, Chariots, and other attendance in great magnificence. Next comes a man mounted on a great hor&s;e, trapped with <HI>Aiofar,</HI> a &s;ort of &s;tuffe which the tree <HI>Areca</HI> bears, and he often cries aloud, <HI>Tacar</HI> and <HI>Etefra,</HI> which is the &s;ame; as take heed, and make room.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The victory of the <HI>Negus</HI> over the <HI>Goragues.</HI> His entrance into <HI>Barua.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LEaving <HI>Barra</HI> we went to the town of <HI>Barua</HI> out of de&s;ire to &s;ee more of the <HI>Negus,</HI> and the triumphant entrance provi|ded for him, for a victory lately had over the <HI>Soldan</HI> of <HI>Gorago,</HI> a people &s;o wilde and &s;avage, that of how many &s;oever are taken in war, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve one alive; by rea&s;on they are no &s;ooner pri&s;oners, but by the &s;ent of a certain poy&s;on they have in readine&s;&s;e, they die in the very in&s;tant, or &s;uddainly after. In this war the King of <HI>Tigray</HI> brought him very effectuall auxilia|tions, el&s;e he had had a bad match of the <HI>Goragues,</HI> a mortall ene|my to the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ine,</HI> whom they call <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI></P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion, after he had put them to the rout, he pur&s;ued and be&s;ieged them in <HI>Tamar,</HI> a town &s;urrounded with &s;trong walls, and good ditches, where they were provided of En|gines, made of great timber-pieces &s;o drawne and bent by cor|dage and wheeles, fixt oppo&s;ite, that the rever&s;e was &s;o vigorous, they would founder or break a &s;hip in pieces. For which rea|&s;on the <HI>Negus,</HI> after the trench was filled forbore to &s;torme, nor indeed, but for the help of a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> had he accompli&s;hed his de|&s;igne without extream lo&s;&s;e. This <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> by mine blew up a Tower, which opened a marvelous breach. Then the people,
<PB N="228" REF="121">
mad with de&s;paire, choo&s;ing rather to dye, then be reduced to &s;er|vitude, expo&s;ed their wives and children in the face of the a&s;&s;ault. In the end, the town was taken and demoli&s;hed, and the inhabi|tants to a man put to the &s;word, not one among&s;t them yielding to accept of mercy. The <HI>Negus</HI> took pri&s;oners the Kings wife and daughters, and while he was u&s;ing per&s;wa&s;ions to gain them to come live with his Queen, and that he would wealthily be&s;tow the daughters, the mother and one of the daughters had di&s;|patched them&s;elves with poy&s;on: The other who was faire in perfection had no ambition of death. The <HI>Negus</HI> gave her to his wife, who richly clothed her, and u&s;ed all &s;orts of blandi&s;h|ments to comfort her.</P>
<P>After this victory in <HI>Gorago,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Negus</HI> was to vi&s;it <HI>Barra,</HI> the inhabitants among&s;t other magnificences had erected to him a &s;tately Pyramid of timber, covered with <HI>Fau&s;ell garnets,</HI> either cut by the hand of <HI>Lapidaries,</HI> or coming &s;o from the mine, &s;up|ported by four Gyansts: with a &s;pacious Palace of divers works and <HI>Niches,</HI> furni&s;hed with &s;tatues of Ladies, gloriou&s;ly adorned with gold and &s;ilver, and laid with colours to the life, many Tro|phies of victories. Upon the town River, called <HI>Morabo,</HI> was ere|cted a &s;umptuous Pageant, with the figures of an Elephant, and a <HI>Rhinocerot.</HI> The Elephant was filled with fire, and the <HI>Rhino|cerot</HI> was &s;o contrived with &s;prings that &s;uck'd in water, and &s;pouted it again&s;t the Elephant; the whole &s;upported upon piles, by which the fire was conveyed with a &s;ingular &s;leight: for from the bank to the Elephant there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere &s;ecretly lines drawn, whereon were hanged cartridges filled with powder, which being &s;ired with a cane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tri|umphall entrance of the <HI>Ne|gus</HI> into <HI>Barra.</HI></NOTE> the blazing cartridge flew like lightening upon the <HI>Rhinocerot</HI>; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant the &s;prings being &s;et on work, the <HI>Rhinocerot</HI> encountered the Elephant with &s;uch a &s;tream of water, that the cartridges (the fire not being wilde-fire) lo&s;t their effect. It could not but be delightfull to &s;ee the&s;e flaming &s;quibs of &s;uch velocity, and in &s;uch a multitude in the middle of a bulk of water which oppo&s;ed, and vanqui&s;hed their fury.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negus</HI> and all the Court were much delighted therewith, and the Diverti&s;ement di&s;charged a good part of tho&s;e griefes, which oppre&s;&s;ed the captive Prince&s;&s;e, to whom the combate of the ar|tificiall bea&s;ts was very plea&s;ant, it continued above two houres, till at la&s;t the conflict grew &s;o robu&s;tious, they overturned the Fabrick under them; and all fell at once, and vani&s;hed in the River together, to the exceeding plea&s;ure of all the Beholders, and thus was this day &s;pent. The <HI>Negus</HI> on the mor|row went to Ma&s;&s;e, and as he pa&s;&s;ed, the Militia of the town &s;aluted him with fire-works of ingenious invention. Being returned from Ma&s;&s;e, and going to Dinner, unexpected came in a &s;trange Prince, who falling to his feet, petitioned him he would be&s;tow upon him the captive Prince&s;&s;e, or vouch&s;afe to impo&s;e a ran&s;om on her,
<PB N="229" REF="121">
The King looked upon him as admiring how he pa&s;&s;ed the guards, a thing extraordinary, and unu&s;ual among&s;t them; neverthele&s;&s;e admitting his pa&s;&s;ion for an excu&s;e, he demanded who he was; the other an&s;wered that his Countrey bordered upon the domi|nions of the <HI>Barnaguz,</HI> that is high-Admiral, north-ward towards <HI>Ganfrila</HI> and <HI>Drafrila,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ganfrila <HI>and</HI> Dra|frila.</NOTE> and that the late <HI>Zambaze</HI> Prince of <HI>Gorago</HI> had given him this Prince&s;&s;e his daughter for wife: whereupon the <HI>Negus</HI> cau&s;ed her to be called, and after a mutual acknowledg|ment, weeping &s;he told the <HI>Negus</HI> and Queen, that but for hope of meeting again with her hu&s;band, &s;he would not have pre|&s;erved her life, but had in death wayted on her mother and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Queen had gotten a promi&s;e from her that &s;he would be|come Chri&s;tian, and being mov'd anew, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was mo&s;t rea|dy; then turning to the affianc'd Prince, &s;he declared to him that being a Chri&s;tian &s;he could not match with an Infidel, and there|fore reque&s;ted him they might together receive their baptization: this at fir&s;t &s;eem'd very har&s;h to him, yet at length by per&s;wa&s;ions and manife&s;tations, they &s;o prevailed, that he conde&s;cended, and both of them with divers Lords of his train were baptized toge|ther.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The manner of &s;ervice at the <HI>Negus</HI>'s table, the receipt of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Emba&s;sadour.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the &s;ervice at the <HI>Negus</HI>'s table, 'tis as magnificent as with any Prince on earth, for the multitude of Officers: our curio&s;ity found &s;o much favour as to &s;ee it, and among&s;t other things remarkable, there were three pages in raz'd ti&s;&s;ue, &s;uitable with a bed in a corner of the room, as we perceived coming in, the <HI>Negus</HI>'s lodging as I &s;uppos'd. The&s;e Pages brought to the Table three di&s;hes made of a black wood they call <HI>Euate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Al.</HI> calls it <HI>Gauete.</HI></NOTE> like to our Ebony, of precious e&s;teem with them, for the property it hath to bur&s;t in pieces as &s;oon as poy&s;on comes within it. The&s;e di&s;hes were half full, one you mu&s;t know with a &s;ort of pear, which cut in middle pre&s;ents the perfect figure of a Cro&s;&s;e, a &s;trange rarity in a fruit, the &s;econd half full of burning coals, and the third of a&s;hes. This to repre&s;ent Chri&s;ts Pa&s;&s;ion, Death, and Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="122">The re&s;t of the &s;ervice was mo&s;t &s;plendid, as well for &s;tate as deli|cacy of meats, ingeniou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed and perfumed, with an odour &s;o &s;weet and plea&s;ant, as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible any could be more. The canopy of &s;tate over the Princes head was of the &s;ame as the bed and the Pages apparel were. There were others diver&s;ly habited, but all rich, and every one two di&s;tinct ve&s;tures, one that had but a half-&s;leeve, with ba&s;es falling over their bu&s;kins, and hiding &s;ome part of their &s;hoe. But I will relate the re&s;t of the &s;ervice, when I deliver the reception of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Kings Emba&s;&s;adour, <HI>Don Franci&s;co di Lopes,</HI> &s;ent to the grand <HI>Neguz</HI> for leave to build Forts upon his coa&s;ts, as well for the advance of commerce, as the propagation of Religion. He came on land in <HI>Africa,</HI> towards the river <HI>Souac,</HI> near the Mona&s;tery of the Holy Gho&s;t, of the religious Ob&s;ervantines I &s;poke of before. We met with him before that in our travels, and he came along with us as far as the head of that River, where we &s;et him on &s;hore near the Church or the Mona&s;tery of the Holy Gho&s;t, which is one of the chiefe&s;t Fortifications the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> hath, and 'tis there 'tis &s;aid 300. religious are, where he &s;taid &s;ome dayes to refre&s;h him&s;elf, then took his journy towards the Court, whither from that place he had 4. or 500. leagues of land to cro&s;&s;e, and yet 'twas a for|tune to him that the Court was no further remov'd, for as it might have happened, he might have had above 700. leagues before he reacht thither. Being furni&s;hed with hor&s;es at this Mona&s;tery for him&s;elf and his company, (who were &s;ome fourteen or fifteen in number, he came, as he &s;ince told us, to another Church or Mo|na&s;tery &s;ome &s;even or eight leagues from thence, but with ex|tream trouble, his hor&s;es &s;o tiring, that the &s;ervants were fain to carry the baggage them&s;elves for two leagues together. At length he got to the Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Dominick,</HI> as he called it, where he found good entertainment, and changed his hor&s;es, which were for no further &s;ervice, being &s;o extreamly beaten out with travail|ing un&s;hod, as they u&s;e in tho&s;e parts, becau&s;e they have not the art of &s;hooing. As he was upon the point to depart thence, there fell &s;uch an exce&s;&s;e of rains, that the Rivers were &s;o broken out, that he was con&s;trained to &s;tay near a month longer, and ex|pect till they retir'd within their banks. Then he continued his journey, and having cro&s;&s;ed a va&s;t Countrey came to <HI>Mongibir,</HI> where he made a vi&s;it to the King, who was then &s;ick, but u&s;ed him with great civilities. The Emba&s;&s;adour offered him the ad|vice of his Phy&s;ician, but he told him our Lord who had &s;ent his grief &s;hould cure it. He furni&s;hed him with hor&s;es, and appointed his own Son to conduct him even to the Court. By the way he met with many other Mona&s;teries, and mountainous and unplea|&s;ant Countries: thence he came to the Province of <HI>Tigremahon,</HI> &s;ubject to the <HI>Negus,</HI> who hath five kingdoms under his domini|on: here 'twas he fir&s;t drunk the honied wine kept in great ox|horns.
<PB N="231" REF="122">
From thence he travailed to <HI>Culu&s;en,</HI> and many other Countries, till he arrived near <HI>Barra,</HI> where the Court lay. As &s;oon as we had notice of it, we failed not to pre&s;ent our re&s;pects to him, and he returned many civilities to the <HI>Sieur de lu Courb,</HI> as the principal among&s;t us, but neverthele&s;&s;e with a <HI>So&s;&s;iego</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gravity, of which the <HI>Sieur</HI> &s;eemed to take no notice, for that we de&s;igned by his mediation to &s;ee the <HI>Negus</HI> at table, which as yet we had not compa&s;&s;ed; though for his own part out of the gravity or vanity of his Countrey, he di&s;dained to &s;ee it, yet by rea&s;on of his quality he might have done it without difficulty. This being ob&s;erved by the <HI>Sieur de la Courb,</HI> he &s;o well fea&s;ted a Ma&s;ter of hou&s;hold to the <HI>Abuma,</HI> that he promi&s;ed us we &s;hould &s;ee him at &s;upper, as we did two dayes after: but I believe he fir&s;t demanded his Ma&s;ters licence, then he brought us to the Mona|&s;tery of <HI>Atania,</HI> for the <HI>Negus</HI> &s;eldom lodges in tents, where he finds Mona&s;teries or Churches, as there are plenty in this Coun|trey. 'Twas there we &s;aw the Prince &s;up, in the manner I &s;poke of.</P>
<P>As concerning the Emba&s;&s;adour, the <HI>Negus</HI> having intelligence of his coming, &s;ent a hand&s;om company of Cavaliers to receive him, and &s;ome eight dayes before had &s;ent a grand <HI>Serami</HI> to conduct him, which <HI>Serami</HI> was not &s;paring of his cudgell to any upon the way, that gave not the Emba&s;&s;adour honour, who being met by the&s;e Cavaliers many &s;alutes and complements were inter|changed. Being arrived at the Camp they pre&s;ented him a tent of Canvas, which was &s;omething di&s;liked by the Emba&s;&s;adour, as being un&s;uitable to his quality, neverthele&s;&s;e he &s;eemed to take no notice of it; but the <HI>Serami</HI> perceiving &s;omething, told him for excu&s;e, they u&s;ed him no cour&s;er than the Prince him&s;elf who had no better: which gave &s;atisfaction to the Emba&s;&s;adour: then they brought him in provi&s;ion of victuals, for him and his retinue. 'Twas three dayes before he had audience, then &s;ome principall Gentlemen and Officers came for him by night, and conducted him to the Court, which was then at a goodly Mona&s;tery; and being brought into the chamber of pre&s;ence, he found the <HI>Negus</HI> &s;itting on a bed of raz'd gold, and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, four pages in the &s;ame &s;tuff &s;tanding bare at the bed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> feet with lighted <HI>Flambeaus</HI> in their hands. The Emba&s;&s;adour made him a mo&s;t re&s;pectfull reverence at &s;even or eight paces di&s;tance, bowing exceeding low, whereas others ki&s;&s;e the ground; and the <HI>Negus</HI> unvailing a little one &s;ide of his face, demanded the Pre&s;ents the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had &s;ent him, where the other being ready to an&s;wer, &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould have a compleat audience, the per&s;on that brought him in told him at pre&s;ent it might not be, and that the King had &s;een him was &s;ufficient for the fir&s;t time, and &s;o without further cere|monies he delivered his letters, which were read by an Interpre|ter. On the morrow about midnight the Emba&s;&s;adour was &s;ent

for again in the &s;ame &s;ort and ceremony; then the Emba&s;&s;adour carried the Pre&s;ent, which was in pieces of &s;ilk, &s;pices, and &s;ome rich and well-wrought arms. The <HI>Negus</HI> received them, then di&s;mis'd him, cau&s;ing one to tell him he &s;hould &s;hortly be di&s;|patch'd.</P>
<P>The next day he was &s;ent for again to Court, where he dined with the King and Queen, the King a little remov'd at &s;ome di&s;tance from them. The fir&s;t &s;ervice was three gold di&s;hes, the fir&s;t full of fire, the &s;econd of a&s;hes, and the third of the miraculous pears I &s;poke of, in which, being cut, there appears a perfect natu|rall cro&s;&s;e, repre&s;enting our Redemption, as the other eternall pains and death.</P>
<P>Afterwards came all &s;orts of exqui&s;ite and delicate meats. The Emba&s;&s;adour having &s;taid &s;ome months in the Court, the <HI>Negus</HI> &s;ent him a letter for his Ma&s;ter, though letters are not in u&s;e with them, content onely to &s;end their me&s;&s;engers, who deliver their mi&s;&s;ives by vocal relation: but this letter was at the proper in&s;tance of the Emba&s;&s;adour him&s;elf, as he told me a good while after, when I met him at <HI>Grenada</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When I mentioned the Army of the <HI>Negus,</HI> I forgot to tell you 'tis ranged in &s;uch &s;ort, that the <HI>Lanciers</HI> are quarter'd outmo&s;t round the Camp, lined with the Cavalry, and mu&s;queteers within them, all quarter'd in order, and &s;treets, as in a Town: the Soul|diers apart by them&s;elves, Merchants on one &s;ide, and Artificers on the other; &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and tents will &s;erve for four&s;core thou&s;and men. The Cavalry mo&s;t commonly con&s;i&s;ts of thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e, all un&s;hod, for they have not the art to &s;hooe them, &s;tout and indefatigable, being brought up by Cowes from which they take the calfs and put colts in their places.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Emperour ordinarily depends not upon his proprietary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: for bedes the gold and &s;ilver his people pay as tribute, they pay him amber, musk, civet, &s;tones, and all &s;orts of victuals and &s;u&s;tenance; &s;o as he hath not much u&s;e of money more then to pay his Officers and &s;ervants, who are paid their &s;tipend in gold or &s;ilver uncoin'd in gobbets exactly weigh|ed, be&s;ides &s;uch a proportion of diet every day for their lively|hood, as in <HI>Italy,</HI> Cardinals, Princes, and the Nobility u&s;e to do.</P>

form of an ear-pendant, which renders him &s;o qualified, that the time may come he may be capable of the charge of <HI>Benchaye,</HI> who is the per&s;on next to the King: if it be a girle &s;he &s;hall be married to a per&s;on of high degree. Though they want not mines of baleys, rubies, and of &s;ilver, be&s;ides other mettals, as tin and cop|per, whence they get an earth which makes the mo&s;t pure violet colour in the world, wherewith they make their hou&s;es very gracefull to the eye, neverthele&s;&s;e their fancy is to paint their arms and legs, &s;pecially the nails, and hang pieces of old iron in their ears. A <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> one day &s;hewed them a piece of gold again&s;t the &s;un, which charmed them &s;o, that they immediately made it known to their king, who re&s;olved to have it at any price to hang in his ear, as a thing miraculous and &s;acred, and gave for it half a tun-weight of cinamon.</P>
<P>As concerning the Articles of their Faith, they have no Idols in their Temples, but on &s;olemn fea&s;ts being a&s;&s;embled they dance round, and &s;ing hymns in honour of the &s;un, ab&s;taining from &s;u&s;te|nance till his &s;etting. They acknowledge a place where &s;inners are tormented after death, and &s;ome more grievou&s;ly than others, proportionably to their offences.</P>
<P>Further they have no &s;peculation, being Ma&s;ters neither of li|terature nor characters, a &s;imple people ea&s;ie to deceive, content with a bare &s;ufficiency for livelyhood, not &s;tudying how to make u&s;e of their national commodities to the be&s;t advantage: be&s;ides &s;o kind, they give freely to one another what&s;oever they are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and &s;o gro&s;&s;e, there are many things among&s;t them they know no name for, and are ab&s;olute forrainers at a mile di&s;tance. Their onely traffick is for honied wine, which is brought them from <HI>Suechan</HI> and <HI>Cala&s;en,</HI> in truck for wild beef-hides, and Ele|phants, which they &s;ell to <HI>Biguen.</HI> They are of &s;uch fidelity in their commerce, that they are really ignorant what 'tis to lye, and keep their promi&s;e with religious ob&s;ervation. 'Tis true the In|gre&s;&s;es to the Countrey are very dangerous, by rea&s;on of robbers of diver&s;e nations who rendezvous there, but the King executes mo&s;t &s;evere ju&s;tice on them that are apprehended, condem|ning them to the jawes of wild bea&s;ts, which he keeps in Parks.</P>
<P>This Princes court is governed with good policy, and is mo&s;t commonly attended with four hundred tall men at arms, drawn out of his Provinces called <HI>Marac,</HI> which on the South confine on the kingdom of <HI>Couran,</HI> &s;mall Countries, but the Inhabitants have a particular renown for their fidelity: Be&s;ides he hath con&s;tantly near him 400. hor&s;emen well mounted, and in his &s;table a thou|&s;and able hor&s;es at re&s;t, becau&s;e being generally bare-foot, they are apt to batter their hoofs. To march before him he hath 50. Ca|valiers whom they call the <HI>Joarmamir,</HI> that is the chief Guard, cloth'd in cotton cloth, with bow and arrow in hand: then follow
<PB N="235" REF="124">
fifty Cavaliers more in cotton Ca&s;&s;ocks variou&s;ly painted, with a &s;hort &s;ilk Cloak, not unlike <HI>Meca</HI> Tapi&s;try, wearing on their head a cap in fa&s;hion like a Miter, at their girdles hang little balls of &s;teel with three pikes, wherewith they &s;eldom mi&s;&s;e when they &s;trike, and at their Saddle bow a &s;harp'ned iron like the head of a lance. The&s;e they call the Kings Champions.</P>
<P>The&s;e two troops march in the field about a bow-&s;hoot before the Prince, having between them fifty Elephants richly trapp'd with Tapi&s;try of &s;ilk, each bearing three or four men with &s;trong bows, and arrows three ells long, <HI>Ethiopian</HI> bonnets on their head, and <HI>Alparyates,</HI> or open &s;hooes on their feet: them they call <HI>Jourles,</HI> that is Archers. Then 50. Cavaliers mounted on white hor&s;es, bearing balls of &s;ilver richly wrought, in white &s;hort cloaks with &s;ilver buckles, on their head a red bonnet hanging over their &s;houlders, like a Chapperoon, they term the&s;e <HI>Gouaique Soumi|mara,</HI> that is, the Princes Councell of &s;trangers. Then a hundred more well mounted, &s;tuck with abundance of feathers, their hor|&s;es covered with ca&s;es of Beares, Lions, or other bea&s;ts &s;kins frin|ged with little coloured feathers, a bow in a &s;carfe, and a club in their hand of a &s;ufficient length. In the la&s;t place comes up the troop which is called <HI>Mameiteque Ebaulbic,</HI> or the Guard of the Bo|dy armed with long <HI>lances</HI> pointed with certain &s;tones keen as any razor, which next fire-pikes is the mo&s;t dangerous arms I ere be|held. One among&s;t them bears the Standart, which is the figure of a Sun, and the King marches next after, habited much after the &s;ort as the <HI>Gouaique Soumimara,</HI> a bonnet on his head, band|ed with a white Taffety hanging over the hor&s;e cruppers, with many devices repre&s;enting the high atchievements of his Prede|ce&s;&s;ours, to &s;atisfy the humour of the people, who glory in gene|rous Princes, who&s;e fame may live with po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other the fundamental lawes of this Nation, there is one whereby the King is obliged to marry three wives all of his own quality, without regard to their being forrainers, or of a contrary religion, holding that a good wife ought to make her hu&s;bands will her rule in all things. If they conform not preci&s;e|ly to this law, they render their children incapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t be content with a bare pen&s;ion, and become &s;ubject to an elected King, who po&s;&s;ibly he might have raigned over him|&s;elf. But this difference &s;eldome happens among&s;t them, and Tradition makes mention only of one <HI>Cbapoularin</HI> &s;on of <HI>Jazal|ga,</HI> whom his mother had in&s;tructed to adore the infernal &s;pi|rit, which was ground of much combu&s;tion in the State, &s;o as the mother and nine of her &s;ons were ma&s;&s;acred in a &s;edition, and they elected for King a &s;on of the la&s;t wife, from whom the people received &s;o prudent a Government, that being dead, they erect|ed a &s;tatue to his memory in the middle of the Market-place, in the town of <HI>Biguen,</HI> where it &s;tands at this day. This is a town
<PB N="236" REF="125">
of exceeding &s;trength, mantled with good <HI>Ba&s;tions,</HI> every &s;treet provided of chains for ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, girt with good ditches, &s;cituate upon the fair River <HI>Gambir,</HI> abounding in fi&s;h, which they fi&s;h for in little boats made of reeds, capable only of two men. The King hawks at river in tho&s;e boats, as 'tis the ordi|nary way of the country. They u&s;e bridges of &s;traw to cro&s;&s;e the rivers, as they do in the kingdome of <HI>Garamel,</HI> which &s;traw they call <HI>Ingar,</HI> as in the We&s;t-Indies they call it <HI>Tortora.</HI> The wo|men appear freely in the &s;treets, their garments are a &s;hort gowne after the <HI>Arabian</HI> cut, &s;leeves to the elbow onely, linnen ho&s;e, hanging on the left &s;ide a rich girdle colour'd in devices, to di|&s;tingui&s;h maids from married women, upon their head a linnen vaile curiou&s;ly wrought, hanging down their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Three times the year they admit commerce with the <HI>Suecheui|ans,</HI> for their civility at <HI>Memite,</HI> when they took away all their women, and by expre&s;&s;e command of their King, re&s;tored them without the lea&s;t injury to their honour, a mo&s;t heroick action of a barbarous Prince. From this country of <HI>Suechen</HI> they receive very con&s;iderable commodities, as likewi&s;e from <HI>Couran</HI> and <HI>Ma|rat,</HI> countreys where they have plenty of honied wines, corne, cattle, fi&s;h, and excellent fruits, which they tran&s;port to <HI>Biguen</HI> without the lea&s;t tribute for any thing what&s;oever. When the Kings wives go abroad, they are &s;eated on Chariots, in &s;uch manner as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> or the <HI>Gene&s;es</HI> are, all three together, in the &s;ame dre&s;&s;e like three &s;i&s;ters, and with like affection. The Prince keeps a perfect amity among&s;t all the three, a thing much to be admired. Three principal noble-men called <HI>Genelcoulbre</HI> ever aecompany them, walking &s;even or eight paces before them, with &s;taves in their hands. The Ladies wear crowns of flowers and &s;tones won|derful refulgent, their face open, with pendants in their ears of rich pearls, and bracelets of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If they meet the King, they de&s;cend from their Chariots, and im|mediately a&s;cend again without further complement, as if they had never &s;een him. He makes a turn towards them, then pa&s;&s;es on; and three of the chief of his train alight from hor&s;e, and come ki&s;&s;e the Queens Chariots, who deliver &s;ome certain words to them, and &s;o the Gentlemen remount. I often enqui|red what it might be they &s;poke, but I could never be &s;atisfied for the &s;everal relations told me. The Princes royall are educated in the Province of <HI>Marat,</HI> with prudent per&s;ons well warn'd to in|&s;truct them in obedience to the King, whom they vi&s;it once in the year, which they divide into four &s;ea&s;ons as we do. The Daughters remain near their Mothers, where for their exerci&s;e they are taught to work the &s;hort coats, which re&s;emble the Ta|pi&s;try of <HI>Meca,</HI> which the King be&s;towes as pre&s;ents on the Prin|cipal of his Court, to whom he marries his daughters: the&s;e Per|&s;ons by priviledge may have two wives more, but of inferiour de|gree
<PB N="237" REF="125">
to his Lady-Royall, and &s;o may be elected <HI>Bene-Chayc,</HI> an honourable office next his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Court is well governed, and very polite, but the vulgar are exceeding gro&s;&s;e and ignorant. Daughters of the Nobility marry not but with hu&s;bands of vertue and valour. The King u&s;es all endeavour to civilize the People, but to no effect. Upon a time the King met a clowne carrying fi&s;h, and a&s;king him what he was, received but a &s;light an&s;wer; but being told 'twas the King &s;poke to him, he was &s;o overjoyed, he would needs give him all his fi&s;h, which the King refu&s;ed, but out of love he would needs force it upon him, and kindly threw it all in his lap, whereat the King laughed heartily, and cau&s;ed one to give him a thanks of a better price, and made him come to Court, whence he would part no more.</P>
<P>Some dayes journey from <HI>Bilguca</HI> towards the Province of <HI>Marat,</HI> We&s;tward there is a mountain to imagination &s;urpa&s;|&s;ing the highe&s;t &s;teppe of the <HI>Ceuares</HI> in altitude, which ne|ver wants &s;now, no not in <HI>July</HI> when we &s;urmounted it, which is the end of Winter there. At the foot of the Moun|tain there is a gentile towne called <HI>Moulgas,</HI> the inhabitants whereof are Jewes, tributary to the King of <HI>Mongibir:</HI> one of the&s;e Jewes was our Ho&s;te, who gave us good entertainment, and falling into di&s;cour&s;e upon the Old Te&s;tament, he took us for Jewes, and pre&s;ently we had a whole Synagogue about us to congratulate, but they were &s;oon &s;cared away, when we a&s;|&s;ured them we were Chri&s;tians. Our Ho&s;t pre&s;ented us for a dainty with the fle&s;h of Crocodile, but not being u&s;ed to it, for my part I could not ta&s;te it, for the apprehen&s;ion I had of that furious creature, though I were &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied the meat was whole&s;ome, white, and &s;ipid. He &s;hewed us two <HI>Ducarfs,</HI> the lea&s;t I ever &s;aw, who for pa&s;time he had hors'd upon a &s;heep. Having gotten an Elephant for the remove of our baggage and commodities, we left <HI>Moulgas,</HI> and came to <HI>Suarin,</HI> the fir&s;t Town in <HI>Marat,</HI> a place of &s;trength &s;cituate upon a little Mountain, whence there &s;allies a &s;tream of wa|ter that turns three Mills. The people are kinde and courte|ous, but Idolaters, believing the Sunne to be the maker of all things, and like them of <HI>Mongibir,</HI> that Heaven is onely for the Gods, and not for men.</P>
<P>Thence we came to <HI>Moucal,</HI> an uniform Town, having eight ports, which are all per&s;picable from the middle &s;tation of the Town: Before the Palace-Royall &s;tands a Pyramid, upon which there is the &s;tatue of a King named <HI>Soualin,</HI> who once re&s;cued this Town out of an enemies hands, by the ayd of the Towne&s;wo|men, who in the action atte&s;ted an un-heard of Magnani|mity, for a monument whereof, he enacted a Law in their favour, that they may have three hu&s;bands, but the men
<PB N="238" REF="126">
for their ba&s;ene&s;&s;e, onely one Wife.</P>
<P>Some few dayes journey from thence, we entered the king|dome of <HI>Couran,</HI> a good and fertile countrey, but full of Fore&s;ts, infe&s;ted with very dangerous wilde bea&s;ts, and among&s;t others with a &s;ort of fierce and ravenous dogges, by which ma|ny Pa&s;&s;engers are devoured; as by the way we met with &s;uf|ficient evidence in bones, apparel, and bagges of Pearles and Emeraulds.</P>
<P>Afterwards we pa&s;&s;ed through divers countries, as <HI>Sou|chalbi, Choucay,</HI> and others. In all the&s;e parts we far'd at a cheap rate, for it co&s;t us not in two dayes the value of a far|thing; the good people bringing us &s;hare of what prey they had in hunting, came them&s;elves to eat with us: for our exhila|ration, they u&s;ed certain &s;trange in&s;truments which they play|ed on. The women are rea&s;onable faire, very cha&s;t, but ill apparelled. The maids at twenty yeares of age, may marry whom they will, without hinderance of either Father or Mother.</P>
<P>When they &s;olemnize matrimony, they go to the Temple, where the Father &s;ayes to the young man, I give thee my daughter for thy &s;pou&s;e, and the other Father &s;ayes the like to the maid. Then they take two &s;heeps hearts, male and fe|male, and pre&s;ent them to the Prie&s;ts; who &s;aying certain pray|ers, burn them on the Altar, then ki&s;&s;e the married couple, and joyn them in mutuall embraces: then they fea&s;t with mu&s;ick, and deprive the maid of a lock of haire growing on the hind|part of her head, as is the cu&s;tom for all maids and widowes, they religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve marriage all their lives, in perfect peace and concord.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Al. cap.</HI> 58. and 59.</NOTE>To give account of the Mountain <HI>Amara,</HI> whereof I made mention before, which is in four degrees and a halfe of the <HI>Me|ridian,</HI> where all the Princes of the blood are enclo&s;ed, and carefully guarded, 'tis a large Province, adjacent to <HI>Belequan|ze, Zoa,</HI> and <HI>Ambian,</HI> containing a good number of Towns, Vil|lages, and Ca&s;tles, and is above 150. leagues in circuit. Much about the middle, there is a high ri&s;en mountain of the &s;ame name, directly under the Equinoctiall line, which is the proper Man&s;ion of the Princes. There are &s;ome who relate wonders of the height, extent, beauty, and richne&s;&s;e of it, making it a terre&s;tri|all Paradi&s;e, but there is more probability in what I learnt of &s;ome inhabitants beyond it, who &s;ay the Mount is round, of but few leagues compa&s;s at the top, exceeding high, con&s;tituted of a rock cut like a wall, of difficult a&s;cent, but onely by one certain way.

<P>'Twas in a Cave in the wild of the woods, where he concealed him&s;elf, and this by the con&s;ent of his Lady, who on her part with two of her daughters became a reclu&s;e Nun, in a Mona&s;tery of women called <HI>Aranatingil,</HI> to whom after decea&s;e of the Mother, the <HI>Negus</HI> &s;ent to per&s;wade to become &s;ecular again, and prevailed with the one who was married to the Prince of <HI>Dafila,</HI> but the other called <HI>Agaria,</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in her devotion, and proceeded to &s;uch &s;anctity, that, as they &s;ay, by revelation, &s;he under&s;tood the Place where her father was retired, and &s;ent her Confe&s;&s;or to vi&s;it him, whom he found in the hollow of a rock, to which one mu&s;t a&s;cend by many &s;teps, and in one corner of the rock he had a lit|tle garden with a fountain, and &s;ome <HI>Coco</HI> Dates, which the <HI>A|bi&s;&s;ins</HI> call <HI>Miguel,</HI> and other trees &s;et round.

<P>When any one &s;ues for acce&s;&s;e to the Prince, there is a Noble|man who&s;e office is to que&s;tion him, what he is, whence he comes, and what he de&s;ires of his Maje&s;ty, and holding him con&s;tantly by the hand at the gate of the Tent-Royal, he &s;peaks in a loud tone after a manner of &s;inging, and &s;o gives the King notice of this per&s;ons arrivall, who immediately receives a di&s;patch of his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in few words and &s;hort time.</P>
<P>When the King marches into the field, which is never without his Court and Army, of above four&s;core or a hundred thou&s;and men, he removes not above four or five miles a day, ever lodging at Churches or Mona&s;teries. The Army marches foremo&s;t, with all the baggage packed up in ba&s;kets in&s;tead of coffers. This Court is not hung upon by &s;uch a ra&s;callity as ours is, nor is the Countrey harried and eaten up by &s;uch a rabble, the villages con|tribute nothing, but the whole is di&s;charged out of the trea&s;ure and revenue of the Prince. After the Army is pa&s;&s;ed, comes a|bout three thou&s;and Officers, who carry the provi&s;ions for the Kings table, wine in Barrels, and meat in Panniers, every one car|rying his proportion on his head, tho&s;e who conduct them are called the <HI>Seraif:</HI> Then the Lords called the <HI>Serami</HI> follow a|foot, a javeline in their hand, and a guilt falchion like a &s;hort &s;word by their &s;ide, and the Prie&s;ts bare-headed, whereof four, who &s;erve by the Quarter, carry the &s;acred &s;tone for cele|bration.</P>
<P>The Prince marches under a Canopy, in an Apo&s;tolike ha|bit of white &s;ilke, with wide &s;leeves, and a broad large hat.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="128">When the Court marches they are all well mounted, but ill-armed, for their Armes are neither &s;o neat nor &s;o well wrought as ours: The Prince hath one compleate &s;uite of Armes which he puts on but &s;eldom: The King of <HI>Spain</HI> pre&s;ented him with a &s;uit by his Emba&s;&s;adour, which was mu&s;|quet proof.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Arms are half-pikes, and battle-axes, of which they know how to make good u&s;e. Their tents of thick &s;trong cloth: the Prince's of white linnen lined with leather, &s;o &s;pa|cious, 'tis capable to comprehend twelve thou&s;and per&s;ons, do|me&s;tick Officers, and Servants, as I &s;aid before, and the La|dies of Honour to the Queen, be&s;ides the Cavalry who &s;erve by Quarter, and are tho&s;e who wear the Lions &s;kin. In the middle of the Tent there &s;tands a Church of va&s;t circumference, near to which the King and Queen onely inhabit, for upon oc|ca&s;ion of any conference, they come into other apartements. His Tent alone is like a little Town, containing within it his very &s;tables, all regularly compo&s;ed, and well governed. He hath his mu&s;ick &s;inging day and night, the Mu&s;icians di&s;charging their duties by turns; though he be not in his Tent, the &s;ame reverence and re&s;pect is ob&s;erved as if he were pre&s;ent. He who hath the office to expo&s;tulate and induct tho&s;e who make ad|dre&s;&s;es to the Prince, after he under&s;tands the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; if he cannot of him&s;elf give &s;atisfaction, he repairs to the Prince, to whom he relates the whole upon his knees, without pre&s;uming to behold his face, or ri&s;e up while the King &s;peaks, then returns and exacts the like reverence from others to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As touching Ju&s;tice there, 'tis equally and &s;peedily admini|&s;tred, without any tedious proce&s;&s;e. If any man either in court or Army be found guilty of a crime, he is immediately puni&s;hed with ba&s;tinadoes, the ordinary cha&s;ti&s;ement, but they u&s;e al&s;o buf|feting as the <HI>Turks</HI> do.</P>
<P>For the tributary kingdoms and dominions under the <HI>Negus,</HI> the Law is &s;uch, that no one can confer the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on his Children without expre&s;&s;e licence, and 'tis &s;eldome that the Sonne &s;ucceeds the Father, but where he hath done &s;ome &s;ig|nall &s;ervice for the State: in&s;omuch as they are as it were Go|vernments for life, nor have they a&s;&s;urance to continue &s;o long; for &s;ometimes the Prince to reward their &s;ervices will deprive them of their Crown or Government to advance them to a higher. If he be di&s;plea&s;ed with any one, he &s;ends but a meer <HI>Serami</HI> or Lord, with a verbal command onely, for letters they have no u&s;e of, and the &s;ubject Prince having notice of his arrivall, puts on his Lions &s;kin, in token of obedience, and meets him with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and civilities: whom the <HI>Serami</HI> having told that the King commands his pre&s;ence, without reply he immediately prepares for his journey, with his trea&s;ure, wife and children.
<PB N="243" REF="128">
The King afterwards di&s;po&s;es of him at his plea&s;ure, either de|taining him at Court, or &s;ending him to the warres, till he &s;hall think to be&s;tow on him &s;ome other government or domini|on on better or wor&s;e according to his de&s;ert; for this King is a be|nigne and equitable Prince, exceedingly beloved of his &s;ubjects, which &s;upports the &s;tate in happy ju&s;tice, peace, and tranquillity, every one ob&s;erving his duty: whence it proceeds that they re|gard not to erect any State by buildings, having no a&s;&s;urance they &s;tall de&s;cend to their heirs.</P>
<P>The Crown revenues con&s;i&s;t in corn, wine, cloth, linnen, &s;ilk, &s;ilver, not coyn; but counted by weight, for here there is no mint, no more then in <HI>China.</HI> He hath al&s;o an impo&s;t upon &s;alt, which is a deer commodity here, and in &s;ome places is u&s;ed as mony. The Prince hath the&s;e payments out of the nece&s;&s;aries to livelyhood, and hath his receivers in every town. His revenue is extraordinary great, which he di&s;pen&s;es part in payment of his Army, part in &s;upport of his family, and the re&s;t to the Church and Poor.</P>
<P>The countrey abounds in all commodities, except &s;pice and &s;alt, which comes from very forrain parts, and are exceeding deer, in&s;omuch that for a little bag of &s;alt, you &s;hall have what you de&s;ire, weight for weight; for what &s;alt they have comes either from <HI>Egypt,</HI> betwixt whom and them there are immen&s;e de&s;erts, or from other places &s;even or eight hundred leagues re|mote, which &s;ets &s;uch price upon it: As again they have their &s;pices by the red Sea from <HI>Cochin Nar&s;ingue,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, and as far as the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>All the Towns of the country are ill built and little, and the rea|&s;on is, becau&s;e the Prince re&s;ides &s;o little in them, and the Court is continually upon march and change of &s;tation. The principall are <HI>Barra, Tiena,</HI> and <HI>Barua,</HI> whereof the greate&s;t is not by a third part &s;o big as <HI>Florence</HI>: They are all &s;trongly wall'd, and &s;ome well moated, but <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> with them are not u&s;ed. The Fort or <HI>Citadel</HI> is commonly upon the gates of the Towns, where they keep their Artillery, whereof they have great &s;tore, and &s;ay as well as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI>; 'tis two thou&s;and years &s;ince they fir&s;t had the invention. I &s;aw a piece upon a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> ve&s;&s;el of 800. years ca&s;t, and 'tis no &s;mall que&s;tion, if they had the invention from us, or we from them, as 'tis more likely, if it be of &s;uch antiquity with them as they &s;ay, or whether we happened upon it upon the like accident as they, I transferre to more curious in&s;pections.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other things I ob&s;erve it as mo&s;t &s;ingular and laudable in the&s;e people, that they bear a pa&s;&s;ionate affection to their Princes, and &s;o firm a fidelity that they &s;ubmit to all &s;orts of tor|ments, yea to death, rather then fail in their duties; and will con&s;ent &s;ooner to the de&s;truction of their proper Parents, then of their Princes: It being unheard of, that any one ever con|&s;pir'd
<PB N="244" REF="129">
again&s;t his Prince, and if it &s;hould ever happen, they would extirpate him and his, even to the child in the cradle, &s;aying; there can be no lawful or valuable excu&s;e for the &s;ubject that con&s;pires again&s;t the King. A Tenent &s;trange enough to the per|ver&s;ity of nearer nations, and in particular to our unfortunate <HI>France,</HI> who out of I know not what furious enraged and diabo|lical zeale, hath too often dipt her paricide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands in the Royal blood. God grant her grace to imitate the&s;e loyal <HI>Abi&s;&s;ins,</HI> bet|ter Chri&s;tians in this then &s;he. In all crimes they u&s;e a mo&s;t &s;e|vere and exemplar Ju&s;tice; and a man once ob&s;erved to be nefa|rious, is hated and avoyded by all men: &s;o as if for any fact he once fall under the hands of Ju&s;tice, he &s;hall be &s;o ba&s;tinadoed, he &s;hall feel it all dayes of his life. And on the contrary, men of good lives are beloved and favoured by all men, and if any misfortune befall him, he &s;hall finde every where a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Pri&s;ons commonly are full of pri&s;oners, maintained at the Princes charge, and 'tis but rarely that any &s;uffer death in publick, but com|monly within the Pri&s;on where they fell the condemned with a club. They have likewi&s;e a mo&s;t remarkable Rule for Creditors and Debtors: for if one &s;ell, or lend to another any thing, upon con|dition of payment at a certain day, and after the day pa&s;t, the Debtor hath not paid it, the Creditor goes to the Pre&s;ident or Judge, to whom he opens his ca&s;e: The Judge gives him a faire hearing, and having given &s;ufficient te&s;timony, the Judge delivers him a wand, wherewith he goes to &s;eek the Creditor, and having found him, with the end of that wand draws a circle round about him, with command in the name of Ju&s;tice not to &s;tirre thence, till he be &s;atisfied; then he mu&s;t either di&s;charge the debt, or to pri&s;on without excu&s;e or delay: and if he endeavour to e&s;cape, 'tis death. Being in pri&s;on, they a&s;&s;ign him a day of payment, on which if he perform not, he mu&s;t endure the cudgel; then they a&s;&s;ign him another day, and &s;o forward, till he either pay the debt, or dye with &s;tripes; or render his per&s;on &s;lave to his Creditor, till his &s;ervice hath made &s;atisfaction: Sometimes they have the favour to go get their bread abroad. So &s;everely is Ju&s;tice executed, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, or bribery; for in &s;uch ca&s;e the Judge is both degraded, and puni&s;hed: but it happens very rarely becau&s;e they have but few &s;uits among&s;t them. If one be found to have accu&s;ed another wrongfully, he &s;hall &s;uffer the ba&s;tinado: again if one deny a fact whereof there is evident proof brought again&s;t him, they put him to rack, by &s;crewing his fingers between two planks, and in ca&s;e he confe&s;&s;e not then, they break his arms and legs. Their pri&s;ons are very large, and capable to hold many, where every pri&s;oner labours for his living. The offendors by day have freedome of the hou&s;e, but at night are &s;hut up in a room &s;o clo&s;e, they can &s;carce &s;tirre.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ethiopia</HI> there are many Churches, but of mean architecture,
<PB N="245" REF="129">
though &s;omething after the <HI>Roman</HI> way, with bells with wooden clappers, which yield a very &s;weet &s;ound. They have very little iron and very few fountains; I remember not I &s;aw above five or &s;ix throughout the countrey where I was. Their pictures are ve|ry cour&s;e, Statues ill proportioned, without any figures of relief.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alu.</HI> &s;aith the Prie&s;ts &amp; Cannons are &s;ingle, Monkes married.</NOTE> There are Mona&s;teries of all &s;orts, more or le&s;&s;e au&s;tere, yea they have Religious that marry, but no more then once. In the Church they never &s;it down, but &s;tand upright, leaning at certain times on a kind of Cro&s;iar, or Crutch. They con&s;ecrate the Sacrament in a piece of bread according to the Greek rites, and then in imi|tation of <HI>David</HI> before the Ark, they u&s;e a motion in a manner of dancing in time of prayer, then bow them&s;elves very low: When they go forth of the Church, they hang tho&s;e Crutches out of the Gate in a place covered for that purpo&s;e, and every one knowes his own again. Their Prie&s;ts live very exemplarly, and in great au&s;terity: In the Church they never demand any thing, every man gives to whom he plea&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;tituted &s;ince <HI>Al.</HI> time, who &s;peaks not of them.</NOTE> They have &s;ome among&s;t them who never eat fle&s;h nor drink wine, living on no|thing but fruits, hemp-&s;eed, &s;uch as we feed birds with here, and other &s;eeds unknown to us, and on certain roots.</P>
<P>Others there are of an order not &s;o au&s;tere, but every one, upon pain of mo&s;t rigorous correction, ob&s;erves the rule he hath made choyce of. There are <HI>Icronimites</HI> who ever go barefoot and bare-headed, &s;leep upon the boards, wear hair-cloth, never ta&s;te wine nor fle&s;h, and are as 'twere continually in prayer; Their Con|vents are in woods, where with leave of &s;uperiours, they walk at liberty, without any communication, but at confe&s;&s;ion. Their office holds from Mid-night till an hour before day, then it rings to prayer, then they repo&s;e an hour, and return to &s;ing the office of the Church; which done, they &s;ay Ma&s;&s;e with extraordinary devotion, then take their Sandals, and &s;it down to a very innocent meal. They confe&s;&s;e not at all, have commonly their eyes fixt on the ground, and are much in &s;olitude.</P>
<P>A man when his wife is departed, lo&s;es the repute of hone&s;ty, if he become not religious. They rebaptize as often as they plea&s;e, and ever after confe&s;&s;ions they go to a Prie&s;t in a corner of the Church to be baptized, and you &s;hall &s;ee tho&s;e of the greate&s;t age go to the Font like little infants.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid that they baptize in fire, but 'tis nothing &s;o, for they u&s;e water onely as we do, though their words are &s;ome|thing di&s;crepant.</P>
<P>They have long precept-fa&s;ts, and keep lent very &s;trictly, di&s;|pen&s;ation being allowed neither to Soldier nor Infant, therefore this is the time the enemy choo&s;es to invade them, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hall finde them weak. At Ea&s;ter they communicate after the Greek rites, and force the &s;ucking infants to receive it, giving

them the Teat after it, &s;o that the Church is filled with the cries and bawling of children.</P>
<P>Ob&s;tinate Hereticks they condemn to the fire, but this hath not often occurred, but with Moores who di&s;&s;embled Chri&s;tians. In &s;umme, the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> though Chri&s;tians, retain many ceremo|nies, &s;uper&s;titions, and here&s;ies, both of the Jewes and Grecians, as Circumci&s;ion, Purification, the Sabbath, ab&s;tinence from Swines fle&s;h, from Hare, from blood, from all things &s;trangled, and from certain fi&s;h. With the Grecians they deny the Proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, the two-fold will of Chri&s;t, repeat Bapti&s;me, condemn the Councel of <HI>Calcedon</HI> in favour of <HI>Eutiches</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;|corus,</HI> hold that the &s;oul freed from the body, enters not into hea|ven till the di&s;&s;olution of the world, and many other errours at|tributed to them, denyed by &s;ome of them: but of this the Mo|dern relations of the Je&s;uites, afford better information; who live among&s;t them, and bring in a plentiful harve&s;t to the Church, by the conver&s;ion of the&s;e people to the Catholick and Ro|man Faith.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the Town of <HI>Barua, Bagamidri,</HI> and others. Stories of Sorcerers.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BArua</HI> is a Town, that for bulk and &s;cituation may &s;tand in Pa|rallell with <HI>Samacara</HI> in <HI>Arabia</HI> the happy, whereof I &s;pake in the fir&s;t part. It is rai&s;ed upon a Mountain, at the Foot where|of &s;lides a lovely River called the <HI>Arabic Arat,</HI> by the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ins Morato,</HI> which yields abundance of fi&s;h, but chiefly &s;tore of Crocodiles, which are excellent meat, and they eat them chiefly in lent, at which &s;ea&s;on there comes more plenty then at any time of the year be&s;ides. They come up from <HI>Nile,</HI> and &s;o di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves through all the Rivers of <HI>Ethiope,</HI> that fall upon it. This creature lives both on land and water, is a great de&s;truction of cattell, chiefly of &s;heep, where|of he is very licourous, and will devour one at a mor&s;el, for want of them will break into gardens, and eat the fruits. This crea|ture is &s;o &s;ubtle, that he will hide him&s;elf near to hou&s;es, and vent mo&s;t heavie &s;ighs, to entice people to him and devoure them, as it had fortuned to a poor woman at <HI>Barua,</HI> who had been &s;o taken and devoured, but for the timely re&s;cue of her hu&s;band, how&s;oever was mutilated.</P>
<P>The like happened to us going by night from <HI>Alexandria</HI> to <HI>Rou&s;&s;ete,</HI> for we &s;aw one, which we took for a block, and as a &s;ervant belonging to the Con&s;ul of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &s;tept before to take it up, he was caught by this bea&s;t, who with his tayle drew him under water, and was never &s;een more.</P>
<P>In fine having wandered to and fro among&s;t the&s;e townes of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;elling or trucking our Merchandizes, we re&s;ol|ved to fall again upon our way to our country. In the compa|ny there were &s;ome <HI>Nubian</HI> Merchants of the town of <HI>Ca&s;as</HI> civill per&s;ons and good Chri&s;tians. We con&s;ulted together of our way, if we &s;hould take towards the River <HI>Falucia,</HI> or make to <HI>Gayuelle,</HI> along the River <HI>Morabon,</HI> which runs to <HI>Barua.</HI> But our company being compo&s;ed of per&s;ons of divers intere&s;ts, according to their affaires, there aro&s;e &s;ome di&s;pute; but at la&s;t 'twas determined we &s;hould go by <HI>Gay|uelle,</HI> whither we had &s;even long dayes journey, to avoyd the danger of robbers, who are very infe&s;tuous to tho&s;e parts; as al&s;o the <HI>Tigars,</HI> whereof there is &s;tore through|out all <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and &s;o at length gaine <HI>Zuama,</HI> or <HI>Bagami|dri,</HI> where we left our ve&s;&s;els, and part of our goods.
<PB N="248" REF="131">
Then we travailed along the river through diver&s;e wild and di&s;|inhabited places, being ever ready upon our guard for robbers that might way-lay us to ran&s;ack what we had, and &s;o cro&s;&s;ing <HI>Areal</HI> and <HI>Chau&s;&s;abir</HI> two Provinces, we met with Heard&s;men of exceeding bigne&s;&s;e, who kept tame goats, which furni&s;hed us with milk and chee&s;e, and veni&s;on as much as we would have, for a &s;mall quantity of &s;alt in exchange, being of opinion we had given them &s;omething of high price. Not long after we beheld <HI>Gazuelle,</HI> and other &s;mall Townes, where the greater part are Chri&s;tians, though they hold &s;omething of Judai&s;m, as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>As we thought to go take our dinner at <HI>Moradar,</HI> about a league from <HI>Almina,</HI> a &s;tormy wind under a cloak of thick black clouds pur&s;ued us at the heels, which made us keep near our boats, that if the rain &s;hould &s;urprize us we might have &s;helter at hand.</P>
<P>At the in&s;tant, two men and a Prie&s;t in a gray habit acco&s;ted us, the Prie&s;t with his hat in his hand, &s;aluted us in <HI>Italian,</HI> &s;aying he was of <HI>Cagliari</HI> in <HI>Sardaignia,</HI> and that 'twas his de&s;ire to re|turn for his Countrey, whence he came into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with a Ro|man Bi&s;hop, who pa&s;&s;ed to the other world at <HI>Magadeli:</HI> and un|der&s;tanding of &s;ome <HI>Italians</HI> that were travailing through <HI>Ethiopia</HI> for <HI>Egypt,</HI> he had &s;ought us out to be admitted into our company, intending to take &s;hip at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and &s;teer the cour&s;e for <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Rome.</HI> The two men that were with him gave us high commendations of him, a&s;&s;uring us he would pay well for his pa&s;&s;age, for that the Bi&s;hop had left him three&s;core <HI>Doublons</HI> for his voyage. We made little an&s;wer, but at the &s;ame time, two Noblemen overtaking us in <HI>Palanquins,</HI> or Littars born by &s;laves on their &s;houlders, this Prie&s;t made to them and a&s;ked an alms, and one of them gave him a piece of &s;ilver, then pre&s;ently returned to us, and as familiarly as we had been acquainted all dayes of our life, told us, by asking one could loo&s;e nothing but the deniall.</P>
<P>At length we came to <HI>Moradar,</HI> where we &s;tayed our boats, as we had often done, &s;ince the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Courbs</HI> man, in hope to find the body, for he had rich things about him.</P>
<P>Being at our Inne we &s;melt a &s;trong &s;ent, and found 'twas &s;ome musk cats this Prie&s;t carried with him, which he would have trucked with us for other commodities, but we were loth to be troubled with &s;uch unwhol&s;ome things. There they brought us to table a di&s;h of raw fle&s;h, well &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt and &s;pices, which was of delicate ta&s;te and an excellent meat. After dinner we ob|&s;erved certain people, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly in a bright &s;hining ba&s;on, and asking the rea&s;on, they told us they were looking to &s;ee a troop of Devils that were going to a battail, that was pre&s;ently

We replyed if it might be without danger we &s;hould be very glad to participate with them, and would content them with a piece of money, which they accepted of, and the <HI>Sieur de la Courb</HI> gave them what we promi&s;ed.

<P>THe Town of <HI>Saba</HI> or <HI>Soua,</HI> and <HI>Soba</HI> and <HI>Sabin,</HI> is not the &s;ame which is in the I&s;le of <HI>Meroe,</HI> near the 15. or 16. degree beyond the line, whereas this is onely in the 7. or 8.

natural Bal&s;ome &s;o much ever &s;ince e&s;teemed, growing onely in the gardens of <HI>Jericho.</HI> That &s;he had one Son by <HI>Salomon,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Melilec,</HI> from whom the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> are derived to this very age; That Judai&s;me was at that time planted in <HI>Ethi|opia,</HI> whence 'twas afterwards driven in <HI>Candaces</HI> time, when the Chri&s;tian faith was e&s;tabli&s;hed: but till then 'tis probable it kept footing there, in that the Eunuch belonging to Queen <HI>Candace</HI> or <HI>Judith,</HI> was travelling to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to adore, when he was con|verted by Saint <HI>Philip</HI>; and indeed they retain &s;till many Jewi&s;h ceremonies, as I &s;aid before.</P>

That &s;he travers'd <HI>Nubia, Can&s;ila, Dala,</HI> and <HI>Tamatas,</HI> and arriving in the lower <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her Cavalry, as incapable to travail the De&s;erts, and cro&s;&s;ing the red &s;ea, landed at <HI>Ziden</HI> a Port in <HI>Meca,</HI> came to <HI>Medina,</HI> and thence to <HI>Sina,</HI> and in forty five dayes journy upon the De&s;erts to <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> that being to pa&s;&s;e over a river, upon a piece of timber, being informed by the prophetick &s;pirit what it was, &s;he cho&s;e ra|ther to wade through the water in her clothes, then &s;et her foot upon that wood, wherein the Maker of the Univer&s;e for us, &s;hould con&s;ummate his death and Pa&s;&s;ion, and how of this beam then buried in the ground, was afterwards fram'd the Cro&s;&s;e on which our Saviour &s;uffered; and many other things of like mettle they relate; which they &s;ay come to them by tradition.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Candace</HI> they &s;ay more, &s;he built the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Ethio|pia,</HI> by the Title of S. <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Sion,</HI> and that the &s;acred Table of the Altar was brought from thence. But reverting to <HI>Saba,</HI> the ayre is temperate, and the &s;oyle exceeding fruitful, loaded with Oranges and Lemons, and covered with birds of game. They are a good natur'd people, kind and civill, of long life, and not &s;ubject to many maladies; and 'tis not improbable the&s;e are the <HI>Ethiopian Macrobees</HI> &s;o much celebrated by the Ancients for Longaevity. They delight in good hor&s;es, and chiefly in tho&s;e brought from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> which they e&s;teem the be&s;t of the world. They affect to go hand&s;omely apparelled, wearing two corner'd hats of <HI>Chamlet</HI> lin'd with cloth of cotton or &s;ilk, their garments long, their doublets and ho&s;e of the Mariners cut, like them of <HI>Goa.</HI> The women are decently dre&s;&s;ed in &s;ilk, their face open, with little round bonnets exqui&s;itely wrought; at the crown whereof, which is &s;lit, comes out a lock of their hair, deck'd with gemmes; of pearls they wear abundance, e&s;pecially the No|bility; others wear a vaile of linnen over their face.

<HI>Nacar</HI> dye in the world, and being wa&s;hed, becomes an excel|lent crim&s;on which never lo&s;es colour. The town in pro&s;pect may be aptly &s;aid like <HI>Tauris.</HI> Directly over again&s;t it on the other &s;ide the river, &s;tand two other towns and a &s;pacious Village. The kingdome of <HI>Saba</HI> is &s;tor'd with many other good towns, as <HI>Ma|drara, Ambadarae</HI> or <HI>Ambadora, Mathida</HI> or <HI>Machada, Betma|ria, Madraneli</HI> or <HI>Manadelli,</HI> and others of great trade, the people Chri&s;tians, of devotion enough, but with &s;ome mix|ture of Judai&s;me. They wor&s;hip Saints, but above all the ble&s;|&s;ed Virgin, and when the Angelical &s;alutation, or <HI>Ave Maria</HI> is rung, the Prince, if he be on hor&s;e-back de&s;cends to &s;ay the prayer on his knees, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be mulcted. They have a Legend of a Paralitick, who being on hor&s;e-back, and hearing the Bell ring, without excu&s;e pre&s;ently alighted, and was cured; whereupon he became a Monk of S. <HI>Abiblicanus</HI> gi|ving all his wealth to the poor. 'Tis death to bla&s;pheme the name of God or the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and all both men and women, as they are generally addicted to labour, while they work &s;ing pious &s;ongs to cheer them. <HI>Curte&s;ans</HI> and publick Harlots are there expre&s;&s;ely prohibited, and &s;everely puni&s;hed. A Shooma|ker &s;eeing one who was very beautiful, (for lewdne&s;&s;e) led to puni&s;hment, took her to wife, and &s;aved her, for which he had a general applau&s;e of all men, and &s;he ever after lived vertuou&s;ly and mode&s;tly during her matrimony. They bear great honour to the Cro&s;&s;e, and &s;alute it on their knees, as oft as they finde one on the high way, in&s;omuch as one &s;hall &s;carce &s;ee a Cro&s;&s;e without divers kneeling about it: When a Church, Chappel, or Oratory is to be erected, they ring the <HI>Gadapi,</HI> which means the bell of cha|rity, the bell made of baked clay, and the clapper of wood, which calls them together; and a <HI>Cal&s;ena</HI> declares the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;tructure, to which they make a general voluntary contribution. I have &s;een the very principal Ladies along the river, carry, two and two, the nece&s;&s;aries to it, as Stones, Lime, Sand, and other ma|terials, which &s;ome will carry on their heads. The Prince&s;&s;e her &s;elf leads the way on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and all the other Ladies fol|low her example. The men likewi&s;e do their parts, and in cer|tain &s;tations &s;tand religious per&s;ons, with mu&s;ical in&s;truments to recreate the Lady-ta&s;kers; on the other &s;ide 'tis the Princes part to provide fruits and other refre&s;hments for them, with tables &s;et here and there, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of diet, and wine of honey in large hornes, for they &s;eldom u&s;e other wine, except &s;ome of Dates; wine of the vine being forbidden by Law to all what&s;oever. In this town is the Church of S. <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Sion,</HI> of which I &s;poke before, which they will have to be the fir&s;t in Chri|&s;tendom, built by the Queen of <HI>Saba,</HI> wherein they deceive them|&s;elves; there being more probability, 'twas the Queen <HI>Candace,</HI> or &s;ome other after her: for in the dayes of <HI>Salomon,</HI> and long

<P>Here is a Church dedicated to the &s;acred Virgin, which is one of the mo&s;t famous in the country, for that by exqui&s;ite artifice 'tis cut out of the natural rock. <HI>Candaces</HI> Eunuch is &s;aid to be the Founder of it. Within we &s;aw thirteen <HI>Domes</HI> or <HI>Niches</HI> excellently wrought with fine columns, and drawing near the Altar in one of the <HI>Niches,</HI> the picture of the Virgin with her in|fant Je&s;us crowned, and a cre&s;cent at his feet, then in the middle of the Church the figure of a Bird, &s;ignifying the Holy Gho&s;t, without any either image or figure in the whole Church: The <HI>Ni|ches</HI> made Seats for the Prie&s;ts, in repre&s;entation of the thirteen Apo&s;tles. They have many Sects among&s;t them. The chiefe Pre|late wore a long garment clo&s;e girt to him, at which is fa&s;tened a picket capouch. The man &s;hewed much gravity and Maje&s;ty, and &s;tood amazed when he &s;aw us on our knees before the image of the Virgin, whereof he de&s;ired to know the rea&s;on. But as there were but few among&s;t them of the ancient religion, &s;o omit they not to &s;ing the Prime, the third, the &s;ixt, and other Canoni|cal houres, &s;inging the P&s;almes &s;tanding, Interjecting many &s;en|tences, and prophane ceremonies. They much rejoyced at our devotion to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and began to cry out with great joy, <HI>Anderi,</HI> behold people of the farthe&s;t point of the world of our religion, then &s;hewing them our Primmers with &s;ome pictures in them, they could not contain from ki&s;&s;ing our garments, wel|coming us with &s;uch profound humility, that in tenderne&s;&s;e we melted tears.</P>

<P>Now being lodged in the Prie&s;ts apartment, he entertained us with excellent fare, variety, and well-dre&s;&s;ed, but the fir&s;t di&s;h &s;eemed &s;trange to us, for 'twas fle&s;h raw, &s;ea&s;oned with &s;pices; 'twas of no ill ta&s;te, but rather procuring appetite; then we were &s;erved with all &s;orts of good meat. At this fea&s;t many came to accompany us, and I &s;uppo&s;e every one brought in a &s;hare, for the people under&s;tanding us to be of their religion, u&s;ed us with great kindne&s;&s;e, and as we came out of the Church, ki&s;&s;ed our garments, and pre&s;ented us with birds of divers kinds, for which we &s;hew|ed a gratitude, but accepted nothing.</P>
<P>While we were at Supper, we had every one an Inhabitant &s;itting by him with a cup of Date wine in his hand, others waiting to fill again when occa&s;ion was, and not one of tho&s;e who &s;ate with us eat a bit, but &s;ate onely to entertain us. More we ob&s;erved, that in all the meats, there was not one bone, but &s;o neatly ordered, one could not perceive how they were taken out. There was no fruit for the la&s;t, though they have great abundance; but Plates full of little fryed cakes, like fritters, to which none of us had any great &s;tomack, yet to comply with them, every one took one for a ta&s;te onely, but for my part I liked them &s;o well, that two dou&s;ins &s;carce &s;erved my turn. After &s;upper a great concour&s;e came in to look up|on us, and &s;ome among&s;t them mode&s;tly de&s;ired me to &s;hew them my Primmer, for a picture of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin which was in it, which I did, and they took it, and &s;hrunk away &s;o in the throng, I could never hear more of it.</P>
<P>After this they brought us to our lodging, our beds were mats,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bernu&s;&s;e</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>African</HI> cloth.</NOTE> and <HI>Bernu&s;&s;e</HI> in&s;tead of &s;heets.</P>

<P>HAving &s;tayed there &s;ome few dayes we returned back to <HI>Al|biar,</HI> where we found our company, with our <HI>Almadies</HI> and goods, then together we held our cour&s;e upon the <HI>Nile</HI> for three dayes journey, meeting neither with Town nor Village of any importance, but we &s;aw abundance of Cattle, Bufflers, Cam|mels, and a &s;ort of Goats, which have hair &s;oft and delicate, as white &s;ilk, then &s;teecele&s;&s;e &s;heep; others all white but the head: Swine of extraordinary greatne&s;&s;e, which quietly carry boyes who guide them, and travell them like hor&s;es; but for Apes and Monkies, 'tis incredible what number and variety there is in tho&s;e parts, be&s;ides many other <HI>Specie&s;es</HI> of bea&s;ts un|known to us.</P>
<P>The third day we pa&s;&s;ed by a corner of a wood, which is in the famous de&s;ert of <HI>Goran,</HI> whereof we had the pro&s;pect fifteen days before. There we found Tortoi&s;es of &s;uch prodigious great|ne&s;&s;e, they will travel with a man upon them. The fourth day we came to a gentile town called <HI>Cami&s;&s;an,</HI> where among&s;t other &s;in|gularities; their women are of extraordinary beauty, who enter|tained us with many kindne&s;&s;es, and the more freely, becau&s;e there were but few men in town, the greate&s;t part being in the Princes attendance, who at that time made a new entrance into <HI>Ca&s;ila,</HI> another Province upon the <HI>Nile.</HI> Then we came to <HI>Ca&s;&s;oudra</HI> three leagues from thence, where there is a Colledge, and a School of the <HI>Syriack</HI> language, which the Mahometans of <HI>Dala&s;cia,</HI> as &s;ub|jects to the <HI>Negus,</HI> are obliged to maintain for their tribute; at night we went to bed at <HI>Baza,</HI> and were exceedingly mole&s;ted with knats or cou&s;ins, by rea&s;on of a little coppice of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia,</HI> by which we came, and after that by another of Orange trees, which kept us company as far as <HI>Baza.</HI> The&s;e knats breed in the fruit of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> trees, which is &s;weet, and falling upon the ground &s;oon corrupts, as I &s;aid in another place, &s;peaking of <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Baza</HI> we made three dayes to <HI>Hermita,</HI> a pretty town, only one mile di&s;tant from <HI>Nile,</HI> which comes not to it, becau&s;e the Channel is choaked up.</P>
<P>The &s;cituation is very plea&s;ant, &s;tanding in a thicket of Orange and Lemon trees: there again we &s;aw tho&s;e huge Tortoi&s;es, which men ride on, and 'tis a wonderful thing of tho&s;e creatures, they, their heads cut off, will live four or five dayes, retaining their blood, as we &s;everal times experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="135">On the morrow, holding on our journey, we came to lodge at <HI>Fougira,</HI> which &s;tands in a wood of Orange trees, that perfumes the air with a &s;weet odour. There we &s;aw Archers &s;o excellent they will &s;hoot as directly as a Gunner: and they told of one that &s;et an apple upon his &s;ons head, and &s;hot it off with an arrow: we went to &s;ee the Governour of the Town, who was lately married to a wealthy Lady; and having made our re&s;pects to him, he had little regard of us, wherewith we were no more &s;atisfied, than we were with his Phy&s;iognomy, which was very ill-favoured, but well matched with his Ladies. We &s;pent mo&s;t part of the night to &s;ee the devices and &s;ports the people made, in honour of their Governours nuptials to delight his &s;pou&s;e. Leaving <HI>Fougira</HI> we went to <HI>Fougiara</HI> to bed, a &s;mall but a plea&s;ant Town, having all the day had a violent &s;torm at our back, and happy it was our <HI>Almadies</HI> were well covered; but here befell us a &s;ad misfortune through the fault of the &s;teers-man, for holding too clo&s;e to &s;hore, a torrent of water from this deluge of rain falls upon the open part of the ve&s;&s;el, with &s;uch weight and force, that in an in&s;tant we were all under water, and all our gold, &s;ilver, and mer|chandize lo&s;t, with our Interpreter, and two &s;ervants. 'Twas a mo&s;t deplorable thing to &s;ee a &s;hipwrack &s;o near the land. Yet I had notwith&s;tanding the good fortune to &s;ave a woman, who with her hu&s;band came aboard with us for <HI>Ca&s;iane,</HI> but with this I had the hard fate, that by pre&s;erving her I lo&s;t a little pannier of the chiefe&s;t curio&s;ities I had, which was a lo&s;&s;e of importance to me, and much grieved the good woman, &s;ince it happened upon her occa&s;ion, &s;o as &s;he beg'd of her hu&s;band to take it into con&s;i|deration, and to give me &s;omething in recompen&s;e when we came to <HI>Car&s;iane</HI>; but he who was a &s;ubtle companion gave me good words, which produced nothing. The truth, is in this mi&s;chance, if we had not been relieved by another <HI>Almadie,</HI> we had all been ca&s;t away, be&s;ides that the &s;hore is infe&s;ted with robbers, and bea&s;ts of prey, as Lions, Tigars and others.</P>
<P>'Tis true the Lions here are not altogether &s;o dangerous, for they will not meddle with a man except they be fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted: but the Tigars are bloody and ravenous of mans fle&s;h, &s;o as if they once compa&s;&s;e a man he is lo&s;t, venturing upon hor&s;emen them|&s;elves, giving mo&s;t &s;tupendous leaps and a&s;&s;aults, yea they will fear|le&s;&s;e break into the mid&s;t of a troop of hor&s;e. By night we got to <HI>Fougiara,</HI> where we had a good &s;upper provided, but we could eat nothing for the terrour our late danger had left in us, and the affliction for our great lo&s;&s;e, but for the men above all: For the <HI>Sieur de la Courb</HI> lo&s;t a &s;ervant that had &s;erv'd him twenty years, be&s;ides a thou&s;and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> doublons, and a pound of pearles, by e&s;timation of great value, with great &s;tore of other rich commo|dities and curio&s;ities. Notwith&s;tanding 'twas our duty to embrace all with patience, with prai&s;es to God that pre&s;erved our per&s;ons,
<PB N="258" REF="136">
and in this misfortune the <HI>Sieur de la Courb</HI> had a ba&s;on full of gold, of <HI>Pepitas,</HI> (as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> calls them) or &s;eeds given him by one of the Lords in our travaile, which was in another <HI>Almadie</HI> with the re&s;t of his people, and now &s;tood us in good &s;tead. On the morrow we went to <HI>Car&s;iane,</HI> and lodged at her hou&s;e who was &s;aved when our bark was lo&s;t, &s;he made us a free entertain|ment, and upon her account we were vi&s;ited by all the principall of the Town. There we re&s;ted our &s;elves two daies, and the good woman in acknowledgement of her obligation, thought no treaty &s;ufficient for me, taking &s;o much care for me that next morning &s;he brought me a clean &s;hirt, and gave me other pre&s;ents as &s;he was able, among&s;t the re&s;t, a peice of very &s;ine cloth of <HI>Calicut</HI> to make me &s;hirts. Thence we went to <HI>Saraboma</HI> or <HI>Saraboe&s;un,</HI> that &s;o famous I&s;land, which the Ancients called <HI>Meroe,</HI> and now <HI>Caeguere,</HI> be|tween the line and the Tropick.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay 'twas originally called <HI>Saba,</HI> and took the name of <HI>Meroe</HI> from a &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> king of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This I&s;land is em|braced by the two arms of <HI>Nile,</HI> the one anciently called <HI>A&s;taboras</HI> the other <HI>A&s;tupus,</HI> or <HI>A&s;tu&s;apes,</HI> which is on the we&s;t &s;ide. <HI>Saraboma</HI> &s;tanding betwixt two rivers like <HI>Saba,</HI> is quite hidden in trees very plea&s;antly. There we &s;aw not &s;o much as one Trades-man, or pub|lick &s;hop, but every man in his own hou&s;e works by him&s;elf. The greate&s;t part &s;pin wool or &s;ilk, and dames of the be&s;t quality make &s;tuffs of &s;ilk. In brief, they all work except tho&s;e of ba&s;e repute. They are a people of hone&s;t and religious life, where there is not a Malefactor, nor a per&s;on in the hands of ju&s;tice, no Lawyers, nor no Pettyfoggers. They celebrate Ma&s;&s;e after the <HI>Georgian</HI> rites, with &s;ome ceremonies of the <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Abi&s;&s;ine.</HI> Through all the churches they &s;ay but one Ma&s;&s;e a day, as through the re&s;t of all <HI>E|thiopia,</HI> and all, men, women, girls and infants, mu&s;t hear every day one: there cannot be a people better, nor more devout.</P>
<P>They generally ob&s;erve lent, and the greater part fa&s;t it entirely. They give the Communion to &s;ucking infants, u&s;e extream au&s;teri|ties, are of very re&s;erved life, timorous to offend God in the lea&s;t, grounding them&s;elves on the words of the Evangeli&s;t, who &s;aith, <HI>Hardly &s;hall the ju&s;t man be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;&s;ed by many habitations of tents, compo&s;ed in the form of <HI>Tremi&s;en,</HI> or <HI>Ducalia,</HI> where throughout, the peo|ple were very large of per&s;on, and &s;toutly armed, and waited on with fierce dogs. Then we travailed five dayes, not meeting with any Town but <HI>Guelba,</HI> a place incon&s;iderable: nor dur&s;t we lodge there for fear of &s;ome injury, but lay in our barks. As we pa&s;&s;ed a|long, we enquired &s;til of the Country-men if they &s;aw by the banks the bodies of any drowned men, but in vain, for we could learn no tidings. The fifth day we came to a fair Town called <HI>E&s;&s;ere,</HI> in the &s;ame I&s;le of <HI>Meroe,</HI> &s;eated on a &s;oyle covered with dates, oranges, and other fruit trees. They have likewi&s;e <HI>Coloquintida,</HI> but make
<PB N="259" REF="136">
no account of it. We had &s;ight of a wild <HI>Rhinocerot,</HI> that was cro&s;|&s;ing a thick wood, that with breaking the boughs as he went made the woods ring, afterwards we &s;aw the female follow him. The peo|ple of the Country venture not to de&s;troy them, for that he is &s;o dangerous, and his natural armour impenetrable.</P>
<P>From <HI>E&s;&s;ere</HI> we made towards <HI>Bigan,</HI> having taken in provi&s;ion becau&s;e we had four dayes journey thither. The way is &s;omething dangerous by rea&s;on of certain <HI>Cafies,</HI> a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ines who murther the pa&s;&s;engers, and live onely upon pillage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamatan.</NOTE> There they call them <HI>Tam|matans,</HI> becau&s;e they are of the kingdom of <HI>Tamatas</HI>: They can &s;ub&s;i&s;t three or four dayes together, without eating any more then a little butter, and two dates a day: They are of a large &s;ize by a good &s;pan taller than the ordinary, but very megre and lean, and they never lie down.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed we &s;aw va&s;te Countries but few inhabitants, ex|cept &s;ome &s;hepherds. But before we arrived at <HI>Bigan,</HI> we came to a great hamlet, called <HI>Carfouran,</HI> where we went on &s;hore to refre&s;h and recreate a little: There we bought a barrel of wine of honey, which barrel was made of a cane of one piece, all but the ends. They have of the&s;e barrels that are wonderful large; towards the We&s;t we &s;aw a great field covered over with capers, of which they make little account: we boiled a young calf, which they gave us, I think, for fear we &s;hould do them &s;ome harm, &s;eeing us go in company, and well appointed, and every where we took pa&s;&s;es of the Princes and Lords.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;&s;e, when we came away we gave them &s;ome few dragmes, which are little &s;quare pieces of &s;ilver, currant all along <HI>Nile</HI> up into high-<HI>Egypt,</HI> and are taken by weight. Thence we came at night to <HI>Bigan,</HI> and we neglected not as &s;oon as we landed, to go vi&s;it the Governour, whom they call the <HI>Ba&s;ira</HI>; we &s;hewed him the <HI>Negus</HI>'s pa&s;ports, which with great ce|remony in token of reverence he laid upon his head, &s;hewed us great kindne&s;&s;es, and invited us to &s;upper.</P>
<P>He &s;ent us to our lodging four great hornes of date-wine, exceeding &s;trong and &s;earching; for drinking it without water one would think him&s;elf on fire, and I believe it pa&s;&s;es through &s;ome di&s;tillatory: We kept it to take in mornings in the manner of &s;trong-water. We returned the Governour &s;ome &s;weet-meats in exchange, which were very acceptable, and he gave us be&s;ides certain birds which are good meat, in Province we call them <HI>Fran&s;ons,</HI> with &s;ix turkeys, and four white partridges. Departing from <HI>Bigan</HI> we came in one day as far as <HI>Ca&s;ima,</HI> directly over again&s;t the de&s;ert of <HI>Goran,</HI> which lies on the Ea&s;t and South of it.</P>
<P>This was a day of great plea&s;ure to us, pa&s;&s;ing &s;till by Lawrels and other &s;orts of lovely and whol&s;om fruit-trees, and meeting with many Towns and hamlets, where they have hor&s;es in abundance:
<PB N="260" REF="137">
We &s;aw there a great troop of Munkies pa&s;&s;ing by a lake in the middle of a Plain, and a Gentleman fi&s;hing with Hawkes, which took great &s;tore of good fi&s;h, and carried them to their Ma&s;ter. The &s;ight of this fi&s;hing retarded us above an houre, though we had &s;een the like in &s;everal places in <HI>India.</HI> When the people &s;aw we were delighted with their &s;port, they brought us a good part of their fi&s;h, as Eels, Trouts, Carps, and Barbels, and we returned them two fine horns excellently wrought, full of Date wine. They walked by us upon the River Bank, and de&s;ired us we would &s;tay and drink with them, mean while one of them wrote a note to the Lord of <HI>Ca&s;ima,</HI> whereupon when we were arrived, he or|dered us very noble accommodation, &s;ent us divers &s;orts of fruits, and a dozen of rabbets black and white; exceeding &s;mall, but of excellent ta&s;te. With great courte&s;ie, he offered us any thing we had u&s;e of, and on the morrow, he invited us to dinner in his garden called the <HI>Motochon,</HI> which word is vulgar Greek, though u&s;ed in <HI>Nubia.</HI> This garden was made at the Princes charge with great art, full of abundance of trees, graffed with &s;everal kindes one above another, which to the eye is delightful to &s;ee &s;everal va|riety upon the &s;ame &s;tock, as among&s;t others two &s;everal &s;orts of figs. The like I have &s;een in the I&s;le of <HI>Chio,</HI> and at <HI>Zaure,</HI> at the Convent of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> for there on the one &s;ide I have &s;een fruit ripening, on the other &s;ide fruit decayed and rotten, out of which corruption, certain knats take life, which immediately go and peck the others, which makes them pre&s;ently peri&s;h, which otherwi&s;e would endure for ever, an admirable thing in nature, neverthele&s;&s;e mo&s;t true. There were be&s;ides certain trees which bear nuts as bigge as E&s;tridge egges, full of cotton, as fine as &s;ilke.</P>
<P>There were other &s;orts of fruit which I never &s;aw but there, and one among&s;t the re&s;t, leav'd like the Siccamore, with fruit like the golden apple, but no gall more bitter, and within five ker|nels as big as Almonds, the juyce whereof is &s;weet as &s;ugar, be|twixt the &s;hell and the nut there growes a thick &s;kin of Carnation colour, which taken before it be throughly ripe, they pre&s;erve with Date-vinegar,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lacque</HI> &s;anguine colour for Painters.</NOTE> and makes an excellent &s;weet meat, which they pre&s;ent to the King as a great curio&s;ity. Another tree bears of the fine&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Lacque</HI> for Painters. Al&s;o they &s;ow here Ori|ent <HI>Auil</HI> or <HI>Indico,</HI> an hearb that makes a dye of great price; whereof they make great traffick, and profit.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they have another grain from which they draw an ex|cellent oyle, beyond that of Cinamon, which they u&s;e for re&s;torati|on of the &s;pirits. Then they have a tree like a Pomegarnat, which bears a mo&s;t &s;overaign balme, as I have had the experience: for I brought one of the&s;e nuts from thence, which I had of this Go|vernour in truck for a <HI>Turque&s;e,</HI> wherewith I did great cures among&s;t my friends.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="137">I &s;hould never conclude if I &s;hould write but half the curio&s;i|ties of this garden, where there is a collection of all the Oriental &s;ingularities: But that which &s;eemed of all mo&s;t rare and artifi|cial, was two hands of tran&s;parent Marble at the Fortal, which held a bow bent; when any one knock't at the gate, the hands di&s;|charged arrowes upon them, but the arrovves had no piles, and the danger vvas not great: all this done by &s;prings dexterou&s;ly &s;et on vvork. The beauty and excellence of this garden &s;tay'd us tvvo vvhole dayes here in contemplation of the rarities.</P>
<P>In fine, we took our leave of this worthy Lord, whom they cal|led <HI>Lebetera,</HI> and bent our cour&s;e for <HI>Mi&s;an,</HI> through which vve vvere to enter <HI>Nubia,</HI> a kingdom vvhich confronts the De&s;erts of <HI>Goran, Egypt, Ganga,</HI> and <HI>Borno,</HI> the bounds of <HI>Pre&s;te Johns</HI> Em|pire, vvhich confines on that &s;ide on <HI>Nubia</HI> and <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed many countries in a &s;hort &s;pace, becau&s;e <HI>Nile</HI> is more rapid and &s;vvift here then in any other part, for having reunited all his vvaters, and meeting &s;ometimes vvith open plain coun|tries, vvhere he &s;preads him&s;elf at length and breadth, &s;ome|times vvith rocks and mountains, vvhich gird and &s;traighten him, he cannot &s;o properly be &s;aid to glide or run, as to precipitate him&s;elf headlong, with falls that make &s;uch noy&s;e, it deafens the people round about.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. A prodigious Hi&s;tory of a young <HI>Abi&s;sin</HI> Prince, by name <HI>Joel,</HI> by enchantment transformed into an Ape.</HEAD>
<P>AS we pa&s;&s;ed along <HI>Nile</HI> in our <HI>Bark,</HI> entertaining the day with various di&s;cour&s;es, one &s;hewed me a book of many prodigi|ous hi&s;tories, and among&s;t others, this of Prince <HI>Joel,</HI> of whom I had heretofore heard at <HI>Pegu,</HI> where the &s;tory is repre&s;ented in a Tapi&s;try of the Kings, after this manner. In <HI>Janamira</HI> a Province of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> there lived a Prince called <HI>Ro&s;tan Sofar,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Fafarin,</HI> who by a fir&s;t wife had a &s;on named <HI>Alarin Sofar,</HI> but u&s;ually called <HI>Joel</HI>; and by a &s;econd wife two, <HI>Aman Sofar</HI> and another who&s;e name I know not. Not long before his death, he made his will, and left to <HI>Joel</HI> his elde&s;t &s;onne, his principial do|minion, and all his trea&s;ure; betwixt the other two, he divided the re&s;t of his dominions. The guardian-&s;hip of young <HI>Joel,</HI> he committed to a friend, to whom he di&s;covered the place where
<PB N="262" REF="138">
the greate&s;t part of his trea&s;ure lay hid, which he had inclo&s;ed in a &s;tone that was laid in the bowels of a wall. Three dayes after his decea&s;e, this friend dyes with grief, &s;o as the trea&s;ure, toge|ther with <HI>Joels</HI> per&s;on, were left in the power of <HI>Ro&s;tans</HI> widow, <HI>Joels</HI> &s;tep-mother: who, ambitious the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould come to her own children, out of a frantick malice, re&s;olved to &s;end <HI>Joel</HI> upon a &s;pecious pretence, far enough from his Palace, to a &s;i&s;ter of hers, a mo&s;t powerful Magician, who to raze out all remem|brance of him, &s;hould by vertue of charms, transform him to an Ape, giving out that he was lo&s;t, and could by no means be heard of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame we read in the Hi&s;to|ry of <HI>Gan|fredi.</HI></NOTE> They &s;ay the work was executed after this manner. This Sorcere&s;&s;e was blind, but on the Sabbath that darkne&s;&s;e left her, and &s;he could &s;ee as others do: <HI>a:</HI> On a Sabbath day &s;he took <HI>Joel</HI> with her to &s;acrifice to Sathan, and do him &s;uch homage, as his profe&s;&s;ed &s;ervants u&s;e to do. But he refu&s;ing to perpetrate &s;uch abhominable duties to the Prince of darkne&s;&s;e, &s;he re&s;olved to di&s;patch him by murther; but again moved to com|pa&s;&s;ion by the gracious &s;weetne&s;&s;e in his face, &s;he changed her de|&s;igne. She compo&s;ed a <HI>Bath</HI> wherein &s;he put him, and by power of her inchantmens, transformed him to an exceeding pretty, and tractable Ape, &s;uperinducing an Apes &s;kin over his humane &s;hape, &s;o ab&s;tracting his rea&s;on and &s;ence, that little more remained in him then was proportionable to a meer &s;en&s;ual creature, notwith|&s;tanding which a knowledge was &s;omething more perfect, though he had not the u&s;e of articulate &s;peech, and with a marvellous addre&s;&s;e to render tho&s;e little &s;ervices to them of the family, who cheri&s;hed him, and fancied him exceedingly.</P>
<P>The deplorable Prince lived divers years in this condition, at length he made his e&s;cape into the woods, where he &s;uffered great acerbities, and often perplexed with illu&s;ions of the devill, but was &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;ted by an extraordinary flame of grace, and the vigilancy of his guardian Angell, who for his con&s;olation appear|ed to him &s;ometimes in the form of a dove, &s;ometimes in &s;ome other &s;hapes of like quality. Mean while, it being generally belie|ved <HI>Joel</HI> was dead, <HI>Aman Sofar</HI> his younger brother had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his fathers e&s;tate, and enjoyed tho&s;e wide dominions with|out contradiction. Upon a time as he progre&s;&s;ed with a magnifi|cent train towards the Province of <HI>Dafila</HI>; he &s;ate dovvn to re|fre&s;h him&s;elf under a &s;hade, and cau&s;ed the green bank of a cool fountain to be covered for his table, the pretty Ape being at hand, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before his brother, and addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf upright upon his feet, by mute expre&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to beg &s;ome bread. <HI>Aman</HI> ob&s;erving the quaintne&s;&s;e of his dapper gue&s;t, with a neat white flaxen beard, &s;oft as &s;ilk, and his-body powder'd with Orange colour'd tufts, bad &s;ome bread and meat &s;hould be given him on a Plate, which before he would touch, he went and wa&s;hed his hands at the wa&s;te of the vvell. <HI>Aman</HI> vvas &s;o taken
<PB N="263" REF="138">
vvith the&s;e Mimick civilities, that he gave him drink in his ovvn cup of gold, and entertained him as one of his train, taking him along upon one of his Elephants, 'Tis &s;carce imaginable hovv di|ligent and officious this poor creature vvas in their voyage, hunt|ing for vvater for them, and climbing trees to get them fruits; but 'tvvas ob&s;erved he would be Cup-bearer to none but his brother.</P>
<P><HI>Aman</HI> had married a Lady of high De&s;cent, and be&s;ides had a Concubine who&s;e name was <HI>Amer,</HI> and by both had many chil|dren. <HI>Joel</HI> being arrived at Court, failed not to go ki&s;&s;e the hands of all his little nephewes, and Neices, and of his brothers lawfull con&s;ort, which he did with &s;o courtly a grace, that <HI>Aman</HI> laugh|ing, &s;aid, you are very imperfect in your court&s;hip to Ladies, if you complement the children, and forget the mother, upon which hint he immediately tender'd the like re&s;pects to the Concubine, he had before performed to the wife. In a word, there was not the lea&s;t offence of bruiti&s;hne&s;&s;e to be ob&s;erved in the pretty <HI>Al|&s;inge,</HI> for &s;o they named this little Ape, in&s;omuch that he him&s;elf in imitation of people would pare his nailes; would &s;till his Ne|phews when they cryed with plums, and fruit he would have in a corner, did all kind of offices for his brother and &s;i&s;ter, except &s;uch as were &s;ordid and inferiour, which he left for inferiour Officers.</P>
<P>In Court there liv'd a Lady of Quality, widow to the afore|mentioned Tutor of <HI>Joel,</HI> with a mo&s;t beautiful daughter of thir|teen or fourteen years of Age called <HI>Eugenia,</HI> or as others &s;ay <HI>Ozania,</HI> who falling &s;ick, entreated her mother &s;he would de&s;ire the Ape of Prince <HI>Aman,</HI> to be &s;ome exhilaration to her with his blan|di&s;hments he u&s;ed to &s;hew her when &s;he came to Court to vi&s;it the Prince&s;&s;e, which was ea&s;ily granted. The Ape being brought, as he had been &s;ome learned Phy&s;ician, immediately found the nature of her di&s;ea&s;e, and pre&s;ently applyed him&s;elf to make her merry: which diverti&s;ement betrayed her into the hands of &s;leep, then he &s;tept back to the Palace to communicate him|&s;elfe, and play with his little kin&s;men, and returned not long after to vi&s;it the &s;ick Lady newly waked, &s;troaking her with his little hands, which had &s;omething I know not what of finer make then other creatures of the &s;ame <HI>Species,</HI> as I my &s;elfe ob&s;erved in the figure I &s;aw at <HI>Pegu.</HI> By little and little, &s;o firme a friend&s;hip grew betwixt <HI>Joel</HI> and <HI>Eugenia,</HI> that they could not be a&s;under, e&s;pecially the Lady who was a&s;toni&s;hed to reflect, &s;he &s;hould have &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion for an Ape, without knowledge of any cau&s;e or ground: That cau&s;ed her greate&s;t admiration was, that one day paring her nayls, &s;he would needs pare the <HI>Al&s;inges</HI> al&s;o, and viewing them attentively, &s;he ob&s;erved &s;ome part of them to be co|vered with a thin &s;kin like that of his armes, which were bet|ter &s;hap'd, and more &s;olid then his fellows. This put her often
<PB N="264" REF="139">
into mu&s;ings, till &s;leeping on a night in a vi&s;ion, &s;he be held a venerable Matron covered with a white vaile, who &s;pake thus. <HI>Ozania my daughter, wherefore protract ye to relieve my &s;onne</HI> Joel, <HI>who is the &s;elfe-&s;ame Ape you &s;o tenderly cheri&s;h, reduced to the deplorable e&s;tate you &s;ee him, by the infernal cru|elty of a Step-mother.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But as it plea&s;ed the Creatour of all things to &s;uffer this tran&s;|formation, and in this forme to pre&s;erve him to this houre; &s;ince 'tis Heavens Decree he &s;hall one day be your husband, I re|commend him to you. Faile not to &s;oak him in a bath of tho&s;e hearbs I have properly collected for him, and laid them in &s;uch a place</HI> (&s;he told her where) <HI>and you &s;hall &s;ee his natural humane form re&s;tored him, and he &s;hall be your Spou&s;e, as I have alrea|dy commanded him, having appeared to him in the &s;ame po&s;ture and habit you now behold me. And that you may have no &s;u&s;|pect of the&s;e my words, as &s;oon as you awake, go to &s;uch a place of your garden, where you &s;hall find a &s;tone, which you &s;hall break, and within you &s;hall finde a key of Trea&s;ure, my hu&s;|band put into your Fathers hands to keep for</HI> Joel. <HI>In uni|ty may you both live long:</HI> And with the&s;e words &s;he em|braced and vani&s;hed. The Lady affrighted wakes, and with a &s;uddain &s;hreek wakes her mother, who &s;uddainly ranne to know the matter, to whom <HI>Eugenia</HI> relating her apparition, the Mother &s;oon called Prince <HI>Joel</HI> to remembrance, how about his nine or ten yeares of age, by the malice of his Mother-in-law, he was lo&s;t, no one knew how. Hereupon they both em|braced the Ape <HI>Joel,</HI> who had received the &s;ame vi&s;ion, and was as 'twere out of countenance to be &s;o indulged by the&s;e Ladies, to who&s;e hands he paid his ki&s;&s;es, but chiefly to his dear and be&s;t affected <HI>Eugenia.</HI></P>
<P>Together they went then to councel what was to be done in this conjuncture, that they might not be liable to the indigna|tion of Prince <HI>Aman Sophar.</HI> The Mother thought be&s;t, be|fore he rea&s;&s;umed his &s;hape by vertue of the intended <HI>Bath,</HI> that he &s;hould return to his brother, and after &s;ome dayes of him&s;elf get away, and then they would advi&s;e of what was to follow; But in the fir&s;t place they fetched the &s;tone in the gar|den, and putting it in a &s;trong fire, as they were directed by the vi&s;ion, it bur&s;t, and they found a key, and de&s;cending three &s;teps in a little Arch, they found a door, which they open|ed with the key, and found a great iron che&s;t, with a Ma&s;&s;e of Jewels, and Trea&s;ure, with &s;ome notes of what <HI>Joels</HI> Father de&s;ired after his decea&s;e. This done, <HI>Ozania</HI>'s mother led back the Ape to <HI>Aman,</HI> acknowledging her obligation, for that the Ape had recovered her daughter. <HI>Joel</HI> then &s;tayed &s;ome dayes at Court performing his wonted offices, and application, and as he went one day to gather &s;ome fruit for the children, the
<PB N="265" REF="139">
peevi&s;h Gardener threw a &s;tone at his face, which fetcht &s;ome lit|tle bloud: upon this hurt he pre&s;ently run away, and was &s;een no more at Court, for which all were much troubled; <HI>Aman</HI> cau&s;ed him to be &s;ought for, but they could find him no where, not with <HI>Ozania</HI> her &s;elf. This while the Ape lay clo&s;e in a bu&s;h, til at night he &s;tole &s;ecretly to the Ladies hou&s;e to his fair Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, who &s;uffered torments for him. There he found the bath in readine&s;&s;e, and being in it 'twas an admiration to behold how the &s;kin which ma&s;ked him over, no &s;ooner felt the heat of the water and vertue of the herbs, but it di&s;&s;olved to nothing like a mi&s;t, cha&s;ed by the wind, or di&s;&s;ipated by the Sun.</P>
<P>They then cloathed the Prince in &s;plendid and rich apparell, and the Ladies entertained and fea&s;ted him with an exce&s;&s;e of joy, which he embraced with an affectionate tenderne&s;&s;e, all three weeping for joy of &s;o &s;uddain and unhop'd for a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The joy was generally through the hou&s;e, they to whom the &s;ecret was undi&s;covered, &s;uppo&s;ed him to be &s;ome young Lord, kin&s;man to the Lady who called him Nephew. Then they entred into con&s;ultation what cour&s;e was be&s;t, but Prince <HI>Joel</HI> in the fir&s;t place, would a&s;&s;ure his faith to fair <HI>Ozania,</HI> to whom he promi&s;ed &s;olemn Matrimony in fit time and place. After this they peru&s;ed &s;eriou&s;ly the Te&s;tament of Prince <HI>Ro&s;tan Sofar,</HI> father to <HI>Joel,</HI> who in preference of <HI>Joel,</HI> had di&s;po&s;ed him all his trea&s;ure, and the dominion of <HI>Cha&s;ubir.</HI> To his &s;econd Son he had given the Seniory of <HI>Sanat,</HI> and other Territories, with other &s;ub&s;equent di&s;po&s;als.</P>
<P>All this they found &s;igned and ratified by their Soveraign Lord and Emperour, the Grand <HI>Negus,</HI> for they found diver&s;e letters, many rich pre&s;ents, among&s;t which a cimeter with curious hangers. Now Chri&s;tians of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> rites, they celebrate the marriage 'twixt <HI>Joel</HI> and <HI>Eugenia</HI> in the open Church. And after &s;ome dayes of felicity, they were of advice, that before he di&s;covered him&s;elf to <HI>Aman Sofar</HI> his be&s;t way would be to make his addre&s;&s;e to the Emperour of the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ins,</HI> that by his authority he might have re&s;titution made him of the e&s;tate and trea&s;ure left him by the la&s;t will and di&s;po&s;ition of his Father, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for &s;o long time by his Brother.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecution of this re&s;olve, he took his voyage in an ample and magnificent equipage, and came to <HI>Barra,</HI> where the Court then lay, then having erected his Pavillions he advanced to the Palace gate, and having cau&s;ed the trumpets &s;ound according to cu&s;tom, two principall Noblemen conducted him to the Princes pre&s;ence, where plac'd on his knees, in few words he delivered the &s;tory of his fortunes.</P>
<P>The Emperour with extream wonder called him to remem|brance, how he was lo&s;t in his youth, and that rumour went,
<PB N="266" REF="140">
his Mother-in-law had cau&s;ed him to be &s;trangled and ca&s;t into a River; how &s;he had been called to Court, to an&s;wer the&s;e accu|&s;ations, and could hardly ju&s;tifie her &s;elf.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Joel</HI> brought mo&s;t rich Pre&s;ents to his Maje&s;ty, in a ve&s;&s;el of gold, among&s;t the re&s;t, a delicate Clock with weights to it, a mo&s;t rich collar with a &s;tone incha&s;ed, of admirable vertue to &s;tanch bloud, as was experienc'd upon a goat, which they wound|ed in three &s;everall places, and not a drop of bloud i&s;&s;ued. The Emperour received <HI>Joel</HI> and his Pre&s;ents with indulgements, and de&s;ired his Lady who was come in company with him &s;hould vi&s;it the Queen, who received her with exceeding kindne&s;&s;es. The Emperour was &s;eated on a Throne, under a Canopy, with large curtains, called there a <HI>Mandilate.</HI></P>
<P>Prince&s;&s;e <HI>Ozania</HI> pre&s;ented the Queen with chains of corrall, a cro&s;&s;e of rich Rubies, a Chry&s;tall looking-gla&s;&s;e, &s;et in a fine Emerald, and other beautifull pre&s;ents out of the Trea&s;ury of <HI>Joels</HI> father.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary Ceremonies of the pre&s;ents performed, the Emperour at the reque&s;t of <HI>Joel,</HI> di&s;patched a <HI>Cal&s;ena,</HI> to &s;ummon <HI>Aman Sofar</HI> to come an&s;wer the matter at Court, which &s;trangely amazed him, both for the demande and re-appearance of his brother <HI>Joel,</HI> whom he thought dead long before.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding to Court he came with all diligence, and found the <HI>Negus</HI> removed many dayes journey from the place, where <HI>Joel</HI> found him at fir&s;t, for the Court re&s;ides not above three daies in one place, by rea&s;on of the numerous train which followes the Prince, and at that time was in the Province of <HI>Gi|anamora,</HI> a Countrey of <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who were in rebellion for their impo&s;ts or cu&s;toms. A&s;&s;oon as <HI>Aman</HI> arrived, he pitched his Tents, and before he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the Emperour, enqui|red for <HI>Joels</HI> quarter, who having intelligence of his arrivall, though the elder Brother prevented him with a vi&s;it, and knew him exactly, whereas the other had not of him the lea&s;t know|ledge: Neverthele&s;&s;e at fir&s;t &s;ight, as right bloud cannot di&s;&s;em|ble, he &s;aw his Fathers face in <HI>Joel</HI>'s, and his heart melting, he fell at his knees, and wept. <HI>Joel</HI> rai&s;ed him up, ki&s;&s;ed him, and with mutuall embraces gave demon&s;tration of joy and affection, then &s;upped together.</P>
<P>Supper ended, <HI>Aman</HI> with exemplar deference a&s;&s;ured his Bro|ther he ambitioned not to detain any thing from him that apper|tained to him, but preferring his love before all worldly wealth, &s;ince by divine providence he was returned, after &s;o long an ab|&s;ence, wherein all gave him lo&s;t, with a free heart he &s;urrendred all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed into his hands, be&s;eeching he would have con&s;ide|ration on him and his children.</P>
<P><HI>Joel</HI> embraced him upon the &s;ame, and told him he would
<PB N="267" REF="140">
&s;hare &s;o with him, that he &s;hould re&s;t content, and he de&s;ired to live with him in peace and amity: Then &s;hewed him his Fathers Te&s;tament, which was to regulate them both, wherewith <HI>Aman</HI> was exceedingly &s;atisfied, onely he had a little regret for his Brothers matching with <HI>Ozania</HI> as inferiour to his quality, be&s;ide that he had an opinion &s;he u&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprizall or art to gain his brother; for the pre&s;ent neverthele&s;&s;e he di&s;&s;embled it, e&s;pecially upon <HI>Joels</HI> relating the hi&s;tory of his life and tran&s;|formation, and recovery of his form, manife&s;ting the obligation he had to this good Lady was &s;o great, he could do no le&s;&s;e than marry her daughter.</P>
<P>Hereupon they re&s;olved to go together to the Palace, through the middle of the Army or Court, which is ranked in Pavillions, as a fair &s;trong Town in &s;treets and publick places.</P>
<P>Then with accu&s;tomed ceremony they tendered their reverence to the Emperour, to whom they &s;ignified the agreement and ami|cable accommodation betwixt them, wherewith he was exceed|ingly plea&s;ed; and looking on the &s;word by <HI>Joels</HI> &s;ide, he told him he knew it to be the &s;word he heretofore &s;ent his Father, and if he would employ it in his &s;ervice, he &s;hould lo&s;e neither time nor la|bour. Then he called for two battle-axes for hor&s;emen of an ex|cellent temper, and perfection, enriched with precious &s;tones, in &s;cabbards of &s;ilver guilt, then drawing them out, told them he de|&s;ired they would both keep them in remembrance of him, and that at the Palace gate &s;tood two hor&s;es ready &s;adled, which he gave them, and exhorted them to live in peace and fraternall love. The <HI>Negus</HI> gave moreover to <HI>Joel,</HI> in requital of his Pre&s;ents, two Ele|phants loaded with Matirals, a kind of &s;ilver money not &s;tamp'd in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> for there they make no &s;ort of coin: one of which <HI>Joel</HI> gave to his brother, together with the burthen. Likewi&s;e the Em|pre&s;s when <HI>Ozania</HI> or <HI>Eugenia</HI> came to receive her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, pre|&s;ented her a chain of fair pearls, of an exceeding &s;ize, and a pair of ear-pendants, of rubies which to the eye were two coals of fire.</P>
<P>Having parted with the Court they &s;ent all their baggage by land, to return the &s;ame way they came, and went them|&s;elves to <HI>Vangot,</HI> and thence upon <HI>Zambre,</HI> cut their voyage &s;horter by the half.</P>
<P>At their arrivall <HI>Joel</HI> was welcomed with the joy and ac|clamations of all the Countrey, and <HI>Aman</HI> &s;urrendred into his hands all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his till that time, and reti|red to tho&s;e Seniories that were allotted him: And <HI>Joel</HI> had by <HI>Ozania</HI> two &s;ons, <HI>Gabriel</HI> and <HI>Aman,</HI> who &s;ucceeded after his death.</P>
<P>Here ye have the Tragie-Comedie, I mean the deplo|rable and afterwards happie adventures of Prince <HI>Joel,</HI> who during his Apes life &s;uffered all &s;orts of mi&s;eries, &s;eek|ing his Victuals with a thou&s;and hazards and troubles, often
<PB N="268" REF="141">
brought to events the la&s;t, with hunger, thir&s;t, cold and heat, wandring through forre&s;ts and de&s;erts, often expo&s;ed to the ma|lice of weather, but more to the malice of men, who proclaim a mo&s;t mortall war again&s;t the&s;e creatures, for &s;poyling gardens, pil|laging their trees before the fruit be ripe, and committing many outrages on their poultry, connies, and dome&s;tick fowl, for which cau&s;e they pur&s;ue them with &s;tones, bows, and guns: So as he was forced to u&s;e his be&s;t providence and dexterity to evade the&s;e in|conveniences: and told his Mother-in-law <HI>I&s;ania,</HI> he was often con&s;trained to live on rats, moles, mice, &s;nakes, worms, and other vermine, to prevent dying for hunger.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;ania</HI> enjoying now a perfect tranquillity, took great delight to hear the particulars of the afflicted life her Son led during his transformation, and captivity. This life being properly a mo&s;t cruell &s;lavery, when Magicians &s;hall have power to transform a humane body, contrary to his con&s;ent and will. And indeed he affirmed, it often brought him into &s;trange de&s;pairs, even to ca&s;t him&s;elf from &s;ome precipice. So as one day being in this furious re&s;olution, another huge black Ape came to him, and leading him to a dark deep well, per&s;waded him to leap into it, but terrified with the vacuity and darkne&s;&s;e, he retired; then a pure white bird came to him, who freed him from this temp|tation, and led him to a place where he found a pocket full of bread to &s;atisfie his hunger. Again he related, how following on a time a bea&s;t he &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance, it brought him at length to an a&s;&s;embly of people of all &s;exes and ages, dancing to mu&s;ick with their faces outwards: among&s;t the re&s;t he &s;aw a nur&s;e of his, who be&s;towed a garment on him, for then he conceived he was returned to his pri&s;tine &s;hape of man. That in the mid&s;t of all this he &s;aw a Beare to whom all the&s;e people made adoration, and that the nur&s;e per&s;waded him to do the like, a&s;&s;uring him this Lord was infinitely power|full, and could re&s;tore him to his e&s;tate and dominions, and give him all &s;orts of content and plea&s;ure, upon condition he would do him homage as others did. But as a Chri&s;tian, he had a horrour of it.</P>
<P>In apprehen&s;ion he &s;aw Tables brought in, and covered with all &s;orts of dainties, whereof they all eat, and he among&s;t the re&s;t, but thought the meat very ill dre&s;&s;ed, and of an un&s;a|voury ta&s;te. In the end all vani&s;hed, and he &s;taid behind like an Ape as before, and in a va&s;t &s;olitude, whence he had much dif|ficulty to get forth.</P>
<P>Telling this &s;tory, dame <HI>I&s;ania</HI> much admired to hear that <HI>Joels</HI> nur&s;e who was her kin&s;woman &s;hould frequent Magicians Sabbaths, and re&s;olved to &s;earch the truth. Whereupon they went to vi&s;it her, for &s;he lived not farre off, and found 'twas truth, as the poor wretch confe&s;&s;ed her &s;elfe;
<PB N="269" REF="141">
and <HI>Joel</HI> was of &s;uch abilities, that by argument and eloquence, he reduced her to the right way, leaving that life of abomination, and went to S. <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Sion,</HI> one of the mo&s;t celebrated Churches of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the chief re&s;idence of their <HI>Abuma</HI> or Patriarch, of whom with penance and contrition, &s;he received ab&s;olution, and was exorci&s;ed together with a &s;on of hers, whom &s;he had &s;educed to this accur&s;ed &s;odality.</P>
<P>Her neighbours adde, that there were about her certain marks where her fle&s;h was in&s;en&s;ible of pinching or piercing, as we re|port of our witches here, which &s;hews the devil is every where the &s;ame. In &s;umme, their memorials in particular relate this &s;to|ry of <HI>Joel</HI> for a truth, which I had al&s;o by relation from the people.</P>
<P>'Tis no &s;mall difficulty, how the&s;e transformations can be made by the work of the devil; for though &s;acred hi&s;tory mention the like of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Emperour, that was done by the plenipo|tentiary power of the Almighty, and if the devil do the like,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See if this may be, in S <HI>Aug. l.</HI> 18. <HI>c.</HI> 18. <HI>De civitate Dei.</HI></NOTE> 'tis but by meer illu&s;ion, or by applying Actives to Pa&s;&s;ives, and this no further then he hath permi&s;&s;ion from his &s;overaign Ma&s;ter, who executes his ju&s;t and &s;ecret judgements, how, and when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>We have plenty of examples both ancient and modern of <HI>An|thropolychi,</HI> or men turned to Wolves, whether really, or in ap|parance only by di&s;tracted fancies, which doubtle&s;&s;e is the ordi|nary way Magicians transform them&s;elves into &s;everal &s;orts of bea&s;ts: and the&s;e <HI>Anthropolychi</HI> have been known to come into Villages, and divers women and children have been murthered by them, and that their teeth were &s;hort like a mans. I my &s;elfe was pre&s;ent, when my a&s;&s;ociate <HI>Ca&s;&s;is</HI> apprehended him&s;elf tran&s;|formed to an hor&s;e at <HI>Tran&s;iana.</HI></P>
<P>In reference to what I have &s;aid, I remember at the great <HI>Caire,</HI> I &s;aw a Jugler or Magician rather, by name <HI>Harafit,</HI> who had an A&s;&s;e would do &s;trange and &s;upernatural feats, and many opinion'd 'twas a young man &s;o chang'd to get money, which they call <HI>Ca|rabit,</HI> and the bea&s;t under&s;tood both the word and the matter very well.</P>
<P>For my part I thought him to be &s;ome rea&s;onable creature, or at lea&s;t &s;ome bea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and agitated by a <HI>Demon</HI>; for among&s;t other things he had judgement to di&s;tingui&s;h the faire&s;t woman in the company, though they go all as 'twere ma&s;ked and covered with an Huke that hides their face, and a thou&s;and other tricks, far beyond what I &s;aw of the famous hor&s;e <HI>Morace</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> long agoe.</P>
<P>Some would go further, and have it to be the Magicians own proper &s;on: &s;o as the Clark of our &s;hip, another, and my &s;elf, out of curio&s;ity would needs go &s;ee this Mountebank at his &s;tation at <HI>Brillac,</HI> on the other &s;ide <HI>Nile</HI>; where having wound him up with
<PB N="270" REF="142">
good chear, and given him a hand&s;ome piece of money to unlock his &s;ecret, the Clark told him if he would transform a young Grecian they had redeemed out of &s;lavery, they would give him an hundred <HI>Sequins,</HI> for they had a de&s;ign to make a benefit by &s;elling him to the King of <HI>France,</HI> whereto he con&s;ented, and promi&s;ed to effect it, &s;o that he who was to own the A&s;&s;e and the Grecian both, would renounce their Faith: and hereupon &s;hewed him &s;e|ven Figures for that purpo&s;e, in every of which, there was one name of the&s;e &s;even principal <HI>Demons,</HI> and a book wherein there were mo&s;t fune&s;tous and execrable things. But with horrour we were &s;atisfied with the di&s;covery of &s;o much wickedne&s;&s;e, and left him.</P>
<P>As concerning the <HI>Androlychi,</HI> I have not heard of any thing &s;o &s;trange, as that the Governour of <HI>Bagaris</HI> related one day to me. He told me, that going with &s;ome of his company from <HI>Lio|nac</HI> to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> they overtook an old man with a &s;ack on his &s;houlders, going a great pace towards the &s;ame town, a Gentle|man of the company out of charity told him, if he would, one of his &s;ervants to ea&s;e him, &s;hould carry his burthen for him, at fir&s;t he &s;eemed unwilling to be trouble&s;ome, but at length accepted the offer, and a &s;ervant of the Commanders chamber called <HI>Nicholas</HI> took the burthen, and being late, every one doubled his pace, that they might get in in good time, telling the good old man, they would goe before, and he &s;hould finde them at the <HI>White-hor&s;e.</HI> The &s;ervant of the Chamber coming in with the fir&s;t, had a curi|o&s;ity to &s;ee what was in the &s;ack, where he found a Wolfs &s;kin, &s;o properly accommodated for the purpo&s;e, that he had a &s;trong fancy to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elfe in it: whereupon he got it on his back, and put his head within the head-piece of the &s;kin, as 'twere to &s;hew his Ma&s;ter a Ma&s;karade, but immediately a fury &s;eized him, that in the Hall where they &s;upped, he made &s;trait to the compa|ny at table, and falling on them with teeth and nailes, made a dangerous rude havock, and hurt two or three of them, &s;o as the &s;ervants and others fled to their &s;words, and &s;o plyed the Wolf with wounds, that they laid him on the ground, and hurt in &s;everal places. But as they looked upon him, they were amazed when they &s;aw under the &s;kin a poor youth wallowing in blood. They were fain to lay him pre&s;ently on a bed, taking order for his wounds and hurts, whereof he was covered; and was long before he could be cured: but this cured him of the like curio&s;ity again&s;t another time. The company by this means had but a bad &s;ea&s;on|ed &s;upper, and many of them were &s;ick either of hurt or appre|hen&s;ion. For the old man Wolf, 'twas not known what became of him, but 'tis probable, that hearing of this tydie accident, he was cautious to appear.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the De&s;ert <HI>Beniermi,</HI> and the Townes <HI>Dangala, Machida, Georgia,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Navigation, which I have interrupted for this prodigi|gious &s;tory, we met with a countryman upon a Mare, who went aboard a <HI>Bark,</HI> to cro&s;&s;e the river to the Province of <HI>Da|fila:</HI> but the man never ob&s;erved a Colt that followed him, and leapt into the water to come after his damme, which the man &s;eeing, he be&s;ought the Pilot to turn back and take him in, but the Pilot would not be per&s;waded, &s;o as he was con&s;trained to leap into the water him&s;elf to &s;ave the Colt: But had not we by good fortune been at hand to help him, the poor man and his Colt had peri&s;hed together, the violence of the water carrying them both away. Being in &s;afety, he was &s;o amazed and out of breath, that he was not able to &s;peak us thanks: But he told us afterwards his Ma&s;ter made him pay for the Colt, becau&s;e he had not tyed him fa&s;t.</P>
<P>After this, for four long houres we cut through a De&s;ert, they call <HI>Beniermi,</HI> where we &s;aw &s;everal kindes of wild bea&s;ts; among&s;t the re&s;t two Lions lying in a &s;hade, with their muzzles all bloody; they &s;tirred not at all at the &s;ight of us, though &s;ome were afraid, they would have leapt into the <HI>Bark</HI> upon us. But others better ex|perienced, a&s;&s;ured us no, except they were di&s;turbed; for the no|ble and generous nature of the bea&s;t, who are only dangerous to tho&s;e that hurt them. Joyning upon the&s;e de&s;erts, we &s;aw fair till'd fields, &s;ome &s;ow'd with Lupines and Beans, others with &s;u|gar Canes.</P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Mi&s;en</HI> we re&s;ted there one day, then about two miles further we had &s;ight of <HI>Cafa</HI> a gentile town, and pa&s;&s;ing fur|ther into the country, we went on &s;hore at a gallant town on the coa&s;t of <HI>Nubia,</HI> they call <HI>Hami,</HI> to take in Melons and Potatoes, the be&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>And from thence &s;teer'd towards <HI>Dangala</HI> a very good town; but bearing &s;o much upon the land, our <HI>Almadie</HI> was &s;o fa&s;t gra|vell'd, we were forced to unload our goods, which hinder'd us at lea&s;t two hours, and made us lye at <HI>Bi&s;en,</HI> four leagues &s;hort of <HI>Dan|gala,</HI> whither we went on the morrow in the company of conti|nual rain, thunder, and lightenings: which was the cau&s;e we could not go on the other &s;ide of <HI>Nile,</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Dafila</HI> the chief town of the Province of the &s;ame denomination, where one of the gallante&s;t, and mo&s;t valiant Princes of the <HI>Negu&s;ian</HI> Empire reigns.</P>

<P>We had the plea&s;ure there to &s;ee a morall repre&s;entation of the <HI>Magdabens</HI> conver&s;ion, which was full of delight and contempla|tion.

Some &s;ay that a darkne&s;&s;e ever &s;ince continued in that part of the countrey, and that no man dare come upon the ground, and that the cries of men, and neighing of hor&s;es are continually to be heard, without knowing any ground for it.</P>

They recount many fabulous miracles, a|mong&s;t others, one of the re&s;urrection of a dead per&s;on, pretended in the time of <HI>Soudan Saladin,</HI> who had a &s;ervant called <HI>Aliaze,</HI> married to a fair and rich young maid, but &s;he behav'd her &s;elf &s;o ill towards him, that her love was fixed on another object, where|fore in de&s;pair he complained to the Cherif, or Prie&s;t of the <HI>Mo&s;quee.</HI> This Cherif bade him be of comfort, and advi&s;ed him for &s;ome dayes to conceale him&s;elf, to &s;ee how his wife would take it.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Cherif vi&s;ited his wife, and enquired mo&s;t earne&s;tly of her hu&s;band, telling her if he were dead or lo&s;t, through her occa&s;ion, &s;he was damn'd without hope: being trou|bled hereat, &s;he told him &s;he had not &s;een him of fifteen or &s;ixteen dayes, and that &s;he was much afflicted for his ab&s;ence, but that &s;he would make a vow to God and the Prophet, if &s;he could have him again &s;he would be more dutifull to him. At the &s;ame time, by fortune, there was taken up the body of a young man who was drowned in <HI>Nile,</HI> &s;o disfigured that he could not be known. The <HI>Cherif</HI> taking this opportunity, and having conferred with her hu&s;band, they concluded to take his body, and cloathing it in a &s;uit of his, and putting his ring on his finger, lay him in the <HI>Mo&s;quee,</HI> covered with a cloth, and &s;ay 'twas the corps of this wo|mans hu&s;band, which was done, and the woman hearing the news went pre&s;ently, and knowing the cloaths and the ring, fell into a

They contrive to build their hou&s;es upon hills, and ri&s;ing grounds, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from waters and humidity: In the countrey, the hou&s;es for the greater part are built of loom, of bea&s;t-dung, and earth, and there are &s;ome which have no other then tents of &s;trong cloth of a reddi&s;h colour; but they who live near the &s;il|ver River by rea&s;on of the impetuous &s;tream of the water which overturns, and carries all before it, are con&s;trained to for&s;ake their hou&s;es, and for a time betake them&s;elves to their <HI>Canoes,</HI> where they lead the Ducks life, till the flood retiring within its bounds, leaves their dwellings to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again: But I am not certain if this happen by a con&s;tant annual cour&s;e as in <HI>Egypt.</HI> The cu&s;tome of triumphs at the arrival of the inundation of <HI>Nile,</HI> we finde to have been among&s;t the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> among&s;t others they celebrated the great fea&s;t of <HI>Niloa</HI> towards the Summer-Sol&s;tice, holding the River for a God, whom they wor&s;hipped under the names of <HI>O&s;iris</HI> and <HI>Orus,</HI> giving him the appellations of the Saviour of high <HI>Egypt,</HI> Father and Crea|tour of the lower, who water'd and manur'd their &s;oyle.

A man walking by the River &s;ide with a little child in his hand, a Crocodile leaps &s;uddenly upon him, and tore the boy out of his armes, not being able to &s;ave him. If any one by chance fall in the water, there's an end of him, there|fore 'tis exceeding dangerous to refre&s;h or bathe there without good caution; the very boats loaded with people have often pe|ri&s;hed by them. The&s;e creatures generally make cleare work, their a&s;&s;aults being &s;o forcible, that from &s;ome they crop armes and legges, others they devoure intirely: They hold a fierce and rude war with the Tigars, 'tis a creature without tongue, moving only the other chop, contrary to the nature of all other creatures;

<P>WE &s;taid &s;ome dayes at Grand <HI>Caire,</HI> where in the advance of my voyage I &s;taid many moneths; but before I go away, I will tell you how we met there with a brother of my compani|on <HI>Guillen Ca&s;&s;is,</HI> whom he had &s;o ba&s;ely abu&s;ed at our coming from <HI>Meca,</HI> as I &s;aid in another place, when he cheated him of &s;even Cammels, under colour to go to traffick in the red &s;ea and <HI>Ethio|pia,</HI> and we pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Arabia</HI> the happy, to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Affrica,</HI> where in all we were forth in our travailes &s;ix years and a halfe.

In fine, the good fellow by this means &s;cap'd a bad encounter.</P>
<P>Being departed from Grand <HI>Caire</HI> we went to embarke in our <HI>Almadies</HI> which &s;taid for us at <HI>Boulac,</HI> which is the Rendezvous of all Merchants, Chri&s;tians, and others, who are bound for <HI>Alexan|dria.</HI> Thence we came in a day and a half to <HI>Auas,</HI> where we met with my friend who had made all &s;peed for fear of his brother.

At the in&s;tant every man affrighted, cryed out for mercy, &s;uppo&s;ing we were lo&s;t, for we were in the middle of a va&s;t &s;ea, where there was no po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;afety. The Ma&s;ter pre&s;ently ran to the Hold, to &s;ee if the &s;hip were founder'd; on the other &s;ide the Pilot from the Poupe di&s;covered the mon&s;trous fi&s;h had left us, and was gone with a hideous noy&s;e, &s;o as we were &s;afe, and by Gods good|ne&s;&s;e freed of a de&s;perate fear.</P>

<P>The Order at fir&s;t was divided by &s;even Languages, three of <HI>France,</HI> which were <HI>France, Avernia,</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> then of <HI>Italy, Germany, England,</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> Afterwards an eighth was added, <HI>Spain</HI> being divided into <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Portugall,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> being left out, they took in <HI>Aragon.</HI></P>
<P>Of the&s;e eight Languages, every one had two Electours for election of the Grand Ma&s;ter. The&s;e Grand Ma&s;ters have for the greater part been <HI>French,</HI> and the greate&s;t part of the Order con&s;i&s;ts of our <HI>French</HI> Nobility, but I &s;hall &s;peak no more of it, being a matter &s;o generally known.</P>
<P>Having left <HI>Malta,</HI> we &s;et &s;ayle for <HI>Mar&s;ells,</HI> where we landed within few dayes, &s;etting a period to that long voy|age, which had co&s;t us &s;o much time, paines and danger; God be glorified who guided us to &s;o &s;afe a Port, at the time of the great Commet, who&s;e extent was thirty degrees, the taile pointing to the We&s;t, embracing <HI>Sagittarius</HI> and <HI>Capri|corne,</HI> and appeared not in the Sublunary Region, but the Cele&s;tial, &s;o as 'twas &s;een throughout the Indies both Ea&s;t and We&s;t. But I cannot omit to relate how, when I came to my Fathers hou&s;e, who was then &s;ixty five yeares of age he knew me not, but thought me dead, and had made my funeral &s;ix years before: &s;o as &s;eeing me in the Greek habit, he took me for &s;ome &s;tranger, and asking me who I was, I an&s;wered him in language barbarous enough, I was a Grecian, and 'twas but truth, I had almo&s;t forgot my native language, being very young when I left my countrey, and for that I had di&s;continued it &s;o long time. Some vulgar Greek I un|der&s;tood, which I learnt at <HI>Canea</HI> in <HI>Candia,</HI> where I &s;taid &s;ix or &s;even moneths after our fir&s;t &s;hipw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ack.</P>
<P>Then my Father who &s;poke good Greek, having traffick'd a long time in that country, a&s;ked me what was my bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and telling him I came to dine with him, he told me I was wel|come, and bad me draw near the fire, as I did. Then he de|manded who, and of whence I was, and telling him I was a <HI>Mar&s;ellian,</HI> the &s;onne of one <HI>Raphael Blanc,</HI> he was amazed, and troubled, and calling my mother, told her a &s;on of his was come from <HI>Sicily</HI> to vi&s;it him, my father having had a former wife in <HI>Sicily,</HI> by whom he had two children, who lived there up|on their mothers means: whereupon they both afforded me great indulgements; but at length I declared my &s;elf to them, and then there was among&s;t us &s;uch a tyde of tenderne&s;&s;es, there was not
<PB N="285" REF="149">
room for words, nor could we contain our tears of joy. After|wards I related to them at lea&s;ure the &s;trange and various adven|tures of my voyage, &s;hewing them divers curio&s;ities I had brought along with me, among&s;t others, <HI>A&s;be&s;te</HI> linnen, which is made clean with firing, being incombu&s;tible linnen, u&s;ed by <HI>Indian</HI> Princes, and Lords, and are wrapt in it when their bodies are committed to the pile, as the bodies of <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours were in ancient time. I have often &s;hewed the experience of it to per|&s;ons of quality in <HI>Provence.</HI> I &s;hewed them the herb <HI>Falacit,</HI> ha|ving this property, that laying it under a bed all tho&s;e loath&s;ome <HI>Chemi&s;&s;es</HI> worms &s;tock to it, and &s;o are killed. I brought it in a box, but I was ill advi&s;ed, I brought not the &s;eed to plant in the&s;e parts. I &s;hewed them divers other things of &s;ingularity, admired by many both of knowledge and quality. But before I conclude I &s;hall tell you in order, to this re-acknowledgement of my Father and Mother, Brothers and Si&s;ters, what long after happened to me at <HI>Palerma</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> after my Father was dead.</P>
<P>For calling to mind he had often told me he had a Son and Daughter there, I made diligent enquiry for them: at fir&s;t no one could tell any thing of them, for that they were called by their Mothers name, who&s;e heirs they were; and my Brother who was called <HI>Nazaro Bianco,</HI> was called onely <HI>de Nazara</HI>; but at length I enquired by &s;o many tokens that I found out his hou&s;e, and go|ing thither I was told he was &s;ick, which hindered me not, but I went confidently up into the Chamber, meeting a young maid upon the &s;tairs, blood which cannot lye, told me that mu&s;t needs be my Si&s;ter: neverthele&s;&s;e without further notice, de&s;iring to &s;ee her Brother, &s;he led me to his Chamber, and &s;eating me near the bed where he lay, I ob&s;erved in him the very pattern of my Fa|ther, and a&s;king if he had not Brothers at <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> he told me yea, and a&s;ked if I knew them: whereupon many di&s;cour&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ed, telling him divers news and recommendations.</P>
<P>During our di&s;cour&s;e, this Si&s;ter of mine looked &s;tedfa&s;tly up|on me, as &s;he were ravi&s;hed to &s;ee and hear me, and I pre&s;enting my hand to her, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed hers, and took mine, a thing not u&s;uall in <HI>Italy,</HI> and le&s;&s;e in <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon my Brother having cau&s;ed a little daughter of his to be brought in, I ki&s;&s;ed her hand as I did my Si&s;ters, and taking a ring off my finger of an orientall fau&s;et emerald, one of the be&s;t I ever &s;aw, I pre&s;ented it to her, wherewith &s;he was quite con|founded, and in doubt whether &s;he &s;hould take it or no; but tel|ling her her Uncle &s;ent it her by me, with leave of her Mother who was pre&s;ent, &s;he accepted it; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant I gave a fair table Rubie to my Si&s;ter. But as we were in the middle of the&s;e complements and di&s;cour&s;e of our friends, who &s;hould come into the chamber with a <HI>French</HI> garb and alacrity, but the Gover|nour of the <HI>Ba&s;tide,</HI> nephew to the grand Prior of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> and

other Cavaliers my friends, who knowing I was there came to &s;eek me, and by their calling upon my name my Brother and Si&s;ter knew me, and confe&s;&s;ed they had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of me when I gave the rings: my Si&s;ter told me at the in&s;tant &s;he met me on the &s;tairs, &s;he felt &s;omething extraordinary, which made the colour ri&s;e in her face. Then we fell to embraces and rejoyces, like the <HI>American</HI> women, who when they will bid their friends welcom, &s;it on the ground and weep, and entertain them, embrace, and fea&s;t them weeping. So I &s;taid there &s;ome &s;ix weeks in jollity and con|gratulation with my friends. I was willing to relate this pa&s;&s;age, as well to &s;hew the various encounters of mans life, as the in|&s;tinct of bloud which will di&s;cover it &s;elf be it never &s;o concealed and unknown.</P>

<P>BUt let us come back to my return to <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> where I felt the cu&s;tom of change to be of no &s;mall force, which was &s;o prevalent with me, that I had &s;carce re&s;ted &s;ix moneths there, but I grew weary, finding neither the air, cu&s;toms, nor man|ner of living agreeable, I was &s;o moulded to change and va|riety.</P>
<P>As this inquietude po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, it happened fortunately that one <HI>Don Guillerm</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> &s;ent by <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. Em|ba&s;&s;adour or Agent to <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Marocco,</HI> and being very much a friend to my Father, dining one day at our hou&s;e, he heard me &s;peaking of my travails, and was plea&s;ed with my conver&s;ation; he a&s;ked me if I would go along in his company: And I was in a humour &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed that I accepted very willingly, &s;o he en|tertained me. This <HI>Don Guillerm</HI> was a Chirurgion born at <HI>Nice,</HI> who travailing to <HI>Marocca,</HI> was &s;o happy as to cure the King of a pe&s;tilence, with which he was vi&s;ited at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which brought him in great e&s;teem with the Prince; In&s;omuch that he &s;ent him to treat of an alliance with King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who re|turned him with pre&s;ents to <HI>Molouco</HI> and <HI>Abdelmelech.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus agreed, we parted from <HI>Mar&s;eills</HI> about &s;ixty in
<PB N="287" REF="150">
company, and imbarked upon a well-arm'd ve&s;&s;el, within &s;ix dayes we came by night near upon the &s;treight of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> but the &s;tream was &s;o violent it held us back till day, and well-nigh ca&s;t us on &s;hore near the Tower called the Devils man&s;ion, where no body ever lives: for they have a tradition that the ma&s;ter Ma&s;on which built it, being not paid his price by him that &s;et him on work, gave it to fiends who have kept it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Being thus driven on &s;hore, again&s;t the mount of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> as we endeavoured with &s;trength to &s;hove her off, the ve&s;&s;el over|turned, and the ma&s;t and &s;ails lay in the water, which much ama|zed us; but by happy fortune a Pilot of <HI>Mar&s;eills, John Saffoulo,</HI> being aboard with us for his private affairs, &s;eeing our danger, and that every one was fled to the other &s;ide the deck, fell to work and with an ax opening the &s;ide of the &s;hip let in the water, &s;o as the weight &s;et her upright, and by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;caped this imminent danger, being driven by a gentle gale to a point where we ca&s;t anchor.</P>
<P>But notice hereof coming to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gallies, which lay at anchor not far thence, they &s;ent out pre&s;ently to take us and bring us to the Town of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>; while they were towing us along, we ca&s;t into the Sea above two thou&s;and cannon bullets, and a great quantity of powder. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> hereupon accu&s;ed us of trea&s;on, for carrying ammunition to their enemies, for they had found &s;ome barrels of powder which were left behind. Then coming aboard us, like right ravenous wolves they ran&s;ack'd every where, &s;eizing all the merchandizes, and opening the che&s;ts eat all that was good: among&s;t the re&s;t &s;earching a Phy&s;icians che&s;t they found &s;ome purging lozanges, whereof &s;ome of them eat in great quantity, and found &s;o &s;udden an effect, they had &s;carce time to untie their breeches, whereof two or three died, &s;aying, we had poy&s;oned them.</P>
<P>Mean while they put Irons on our legs, and removed us into the Galley, with rude treatment and rough menaces, till at la&s;t &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon us, by which the Emba&s;&s;adour, and ten of the chief Gentlemen were to loo&s;e their heads, all the re&s;t to the Gallies for ever.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;adour hearing this &s;ad &s;entence, appealed to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who confirmed the &s;entence, &s;aying no more than <HI>Loque es hecho es hecho.</HI> But by good fortune the <HI>Mar&s;eillian</HI> Pilot that was with us, when he fir&s;t &s;aw the Galleys coming upon us, ca&s;t him&s;elf privately into the Sea with &s;ome moneys, and &s;o gain|ing the land went to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and this in con&s;ideration of one a|mong&s;t us, to whom he had promi&s;ed his daughter in marriage. Being there, and under&s;tanding the King had ratified this &s;entence of death; he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf pre&s;ently to the mo&s;t Serene <HI>In|fanta Donna I&s;abella,</HI> and &s;o hand&s;omly laid before her the in|conveniences would en&s;ue upon this execution, which was &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="288" REF="151">
to break the peace between the two kings; that &s;he moved with the&s;e rea&s;ons, went immediately to the King her Father, to petition for grace, which was granted, and we relea&s;ed, to the di&s;|content of them who thought to make a good booty of us and our goods.</P>
<P>Being now again Ma&s;ters of our lives, goods, and ve&s;&s;el, after two months time, which was &s;pent in the&s;e proceedings, we put to &s;ea again upon our cour&s;e to <HI>Arache,</HI> a fort of importance in the kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> about 70. or 80. miles from <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> where there is a Port made by a River, as at <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which is cro&s;&s;ed with a bar of &s;and, &s;o as there is no coming in but at high water, which is here every day, but at <HI>Goa</HI> you may expect a month. Coming on &s;hore there we were very well entertained, and the Emba&s;&s;adour provided of hor&s;es, and other nece&s;&s;aries to go to the King of <HI>Fez Abdelmelech,</HI> who was then in great vexation for that <HI>Mahomet</HI> his nephew, who di&s;puted with him for the kingdom, and whom he had defeated in many battails by the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the <HI>Turk,</HI> was newly &s;caped towards <HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to crave his aid. Being come from <HI>Arache</HI> to <HI>Miguine</HI> ten leagues from <HI>Fez,</HI> &s;eeing the Emba&s;&s;adour was to hold on his way to <HI>Morocca</HI> to the King, we re&s;olved four or five of us to go &s;ee <HI>Fez,</HI> the capital Town of the Countrey. Having walked through <HI>Meguine,</HI> beyond the Town we came to a Church-yard of the <HI>Ma|hometans,</HI> where two of us making water, it happened to be near the Sepulcher of one of their <HI>Marabons,</HI> or <HI>Santons,</HI> and being per|ceived by &s;ome of the <HI>Moores,</HI> they would have &s;topt us, but we defending our &s;elves &s;toutly with fi&s;ts and feet, I got out of their hands; but my heart failed when I &s;aw fifty Archers of the Town|guard about us, who paid me well for the blows I had given their fellows, for they beat me mo&s;t outrageou&s;ly, as they did the re&s;t of us, the very Children crying after me, <HI>Tara&s;ti Nazarani,</HI> that is kill him, at every word calling me <HI>Quichequet,</HI> dog. At la&s;t I was brought before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> or Judge, to whom I kneeled, but he made me lye along on the ground, and gave me thirty la&s;hes on the back, with a whip of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-&s;inews, and as many bangs on the belly with an <HI>Indian</HI> cane, &s;o that I was almo&s;t dead, with the blowes which had quite benum'd me; yet again for the&s;e three&s;core bangs I mu&s;t pay as many miticales in gold, which are worth four franks a piece, after all they laid me in pri&s;on, with another bath'd in blood at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Then they u&s;ed all art po&s;&s;ible to per&s;wade me to renounce my faith. Among&s;t others came in one in &s;carlet, and under preten&s;e of &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion on my youth, &s;poke &s;oftly in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> tongue, I &s;hould be advi&s;ed and have a care how I lo&s;t my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Not content with this they &s;ent a young <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dam&s;ell to me cloathed in white, with a Huke which covered her all over, who after &s;alutation, expre&s;&s;ed her re&s;entment of my misfortune, and
<PB N="289" REF="151">
with &s;ome words of con&s;olation, told me &s;he was come to in|&s;truct me how to &s;ave my &s;elf from death, and to &s;et her at liberty immediately. I bent my thoughts upon the woman, not as yet comprehending what &s;he meant, till &s;he explained further that I &s;hould marry her, and renounce my faith for a time, and when the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> who was upon point to give battaile to the <HI>Marocco</HI> &s;hould be victorious, we &s;hould have means to e&s;cape among&s;t the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e ingenuou&s;ly, the words of this young maid made a &s;trong a&s;&s;ault upon me, and made me take the matter into con&s;ideration, but God gave me the grace to hold firme to my &s;elf, and at la&s;t to &s;atisfie her that neither for her beauty nor enjoy|ment of all the world, would I ever renounce the faith of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> my God, &s;o &s;he took her leave. But after this the Judges them&s;elves attended with the Executioner, with his heading-knife at his &s;ide, came to me, and &s;peaking to me, told me I had com|mitted a hainous crime, but that there might be &s;ome reme|dy found, that we had all one God the Creatour of all things, and the benign common Father of all men, who had &s;ent di|vers Prophets for our in&s;truction, and to &s;hew us the way of &s;alvation; but they having one more excellent than the re&s;t, they were obliged in all they could to augment the number of his Di&s;ciples; &s;o as to &s;ave my life there was no other way then by deniall of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> not that they e|&s;teemed his law nefarious, for they knew he was likewi&s;e a great Prophet, the breath of the Almighty, and a great friend of <HI>Mahomet</HI>; but becau&s;e their law was the be&s;t and the mo&s;t perfect.</P>
<P>To this, God a&s;&s;i&s;ting me with his extraordinary grace, I with courage an&s;wered, that rather then deviate voluntarily in the lea&s;t from my Religion, I would &s;acrifice a thou&s;and lives if I were ma&s;ter of &s;o many.</P>
<P>Perceiving my con&s;tancy, they told me I was ill advi&s;ed, never|thele&s;&s;e to te&s;tifie their affection and con&s;ideration of my youth, they would make me another offer which might conduce to the &s;ecuring of my life: whereupon there was a &s;umptuous tape&s;try &s;pread upon the floor, with rich bracelets and pendants of value, all this &s;tirred me not; &s;o as &s;eeing they gained no|thing upon me, the principall of them, the <HI>Ermin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ermin</HI> a Judge.</NOTE> pro|nounced &s;entence of death, and at the in&s;tant the Execu|tioner &s;eizing on me made me lay my head on a block of wood, and without further Ceremony with his weapon na|ked in his hand prepared to give the blow: but as he was ha&s;tening me to pull my doublet off that the collar might not hinder the blow; God in&s;pired one among&s;t the re&s;t, that told them they committed an errour to cut me off being &s;o young, for that 'twas again&s;t their Law to execute any one for
<PB N="290" REF="152">
that crime being under 17. years of age, and that they ought to inform them&s;elves preci&s;ely of it: For in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> the &s;evere law is, that who&s;oever &s;hall commit <HI>Formicat,</HI> that is, pollute a holy place, he ought not to be put to death, onely cha&s;tized with ba&s;tinadoes, and ab&s;olved.</P>
<P>But this puni&s;hment was exceeding cruelly and fully inflict|ed upon me, for I &s;tood the fury of a multitude, who in the in&s;tant came in, and a&s;king, <HI>Chate quei feuti houat Romi,</HI> that is, what hath this Chri&s;tian done, and being related, they &s;aid, <HI>haley,</HI> that is, make room, then they all fell upon me, and laid on till they were weary, &s;o much as a decrepid, horrid, &s;qualid old man, who while he be&s;towed his labour on me, told me, that as I had pre&s;umed to pi&s;&s;e upon the head of one that waited on their great Prophet, &s;o after death the Saints &s;hould &s;hit upon my &s;oule, which &s;hould feed upon that ordure till the Judgement-day, and then be ca&s;t into flames among&s;t her fellowes. His opinion was approved of, but the execution &s;u&s;|pended.</P>
<P>Mean while my Companions were e&s;caped &s;everall waies, and crept into caves, where one of them lived three dayes upon &s;nailes, &s;o as they could no waies help me. But my misfortune coming to the eares of &s;ome Chri&s;tian merchants, who lived in Town, they went immediately to &s;upplicate the Judicature to have con&s;ideration of my youth, that I was a Gen|tleman belonging to the Emba&s;&s;adour of <HI>France,</HI> who would re|&s;ent the affront, and acquaint their Prince with it, whence incon|veniences might accrew.</P>
<P>They were not &s;o moved with the&s;e rea&s;ons, but &s;ome bribes mu&s;t be given, &s;o as the Merchants entring caution of a va&s;t &s;um with me, and obliging them&s;elves for my re-appearance when time &s;hould be, I was &s;et at liberty: Of all tho&s;e there was not one of my Countrey nor acquaintance.</P>
<P>Being at large, I was quartered in a noble hou&s;e, with a rich <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchant, who &s;pared nothing for my recovery, out of this &s;ad e&s;tate.</P>
<P>This Merchant, by name <HI>Andrieto Ga&s;paro,</HI> born in the I&s;land of <HI>Cor&s;a,</HI> had two Brothers at <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> and knew my Father very well, to whom he gave &s;peedy intelli|gence of my misfortune, and received an an&s;wer with expre&s;&s;e order, to worke my delivery at what rate &s;o|ever. Hereupon the&s;e worthy people advi&s;ed together, and re|&s;olved to &s;end two men to court on dromedaries, there called <HI>Ba|cambal,</HI> which are bea&s;ts of extraordinary velocity, that will go their hundred miles a day, with the principall Rider, and one to guide him, with their baggage and nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for their journey.</P>
<P>But by the way, the Riders had need be well &s;wath'd back and
<PB N="291" REF="152">
head for the extreme &s;hakings they give the body, as likewi&s;e to have their ears well &s;topt, for being deafened with the hideous noy&s;e they make by the way. They di&s;patched the&s;e two Cour|riers, one &s;trait to <HI>Marocca,</HI> whither 'twas reported the King was gone, the other <HI>Franci&s;co Maria</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> towards the Sea Coa&s;t to <HI>Alca&s;&s;eur,</HI> where he met with <HI>Muley Moluco,</HI> to whom he was well known, and laying him&s;elf at his feet, related the proceedings to him. Whereupon the King cau&s;ed the Emba&s;&s;a|dour of <HI>France</HI> who was there, to be called; in the end he re&s;olved to return this Me&s;&s;enger with all &s;peed, with order and command to the <HI>Ermin</HI> of <HI>Mequine,</HI> to di&s;charge me without further cau|tion. Upon <HI>E&s;tradiors</HI> return, he pre&s;ented the&s;e letters to <HI>Er|min,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Judicature who received it with great ceremony and humilty, laying it upon their head, and &s;o I had my freedome, and my life &s;aved, with &s;ufficient marks to remem|ber, and for the future be better advi&s;ed at my co&s;t; for I felt the &s;tripes longer after: and indeed this is the greate&s;t danger we ranne among&s;t the Infidells. Be&s;ides, it co&s;t me deere, for I was fain to pre&s;ent the Gentlemen of the Judica|ture, with a barrell of Safron, and &s;ome Tapi&s;try hangings for their curte&s;ie, who afterwards in te&s;timony of their Amity, &s;ent me to <HI>Fez</HI> a magnificent pre&s;ent of a fat &s;heep, and &s;ome other come&s;tible things, as bi&s;quet, &s;ugar, chee&s;e, and abundance of dates, and that was all I got.</P>
<P>At my departure with the&s;e worthy Merchants, one of their wives called <HI>Cau&s;abonna,</HI> in return for a bladder of Mu&s;k I pre|&s;ented her, gave me &s;ix fine &s;hirts, with caps, and handkerchers. At my return from <HI>Africa,</HI> going back for <HI>Arache</HI> this way, I failed not to vi&s;it my good friends the&s;e Merchants, and was likewi&s;e to &s;ee the <HI>Ermin Mahomet Mu&s;tapha,</HI> who by rea&s;on of my change of habit and countenance, at fir&s;t knew me not; but afterwards gave me noble entertainment, for his heart was Chri&s;tian&punc; and made us ta&s;te his good wine, and eate with him, offering me gold, but I refu&s;ed it, notwith|&s;tanding I mu&s;t needs take them, &s;aying they belonged to me; being &s;ome Duckets given him for the Mutton, and other things that were &s;ent to me, &s;o as he made the account but even: which &s;hews how ju&s;t this man was.</P>
<P>And he it was that in my &s;uffering came to advi&s;e me to &s;tand firm, and not renounce my faith, and religion. He had two wives of mo&s;t perfect beauty, and he told me if any occa&s;ion &s;hould oc|curre to draw him out of <HI>Barbary,</HI> he would embrace baptiza|tion, there being throughout the&s;e parts, no meanes to ex|erci&s;e Chri&s;tian Religion, for I heard not one Ma&s;&s;e &s;o long as I was here, neither at <HI>Fez,</HI> nor other townes where there are abundance of Chri&s;tians. They will not allow of Prie&s;ts, which is otherwi&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where there are above
<PB N="292" REF="153" MS="y">
twenty Churches, where they celebrate divine &s;ervice, both in <HI>Greek, Latine,</HI> and <HI>Abi&s;&s;inian,</HI> and is free exerci&s;e of Religion for all Chri&s;tians: and if the body of a Chri&s;tian be to be interred at any di&s;tance from thence, the Prie&s;ts with the cro&s;&s;e go publickly for it, and carry it whither they plea&s;e, without the lea&s;t injury from any one, upon pain of being well puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>During this progre&s;&s;e of affairs, King <HI>Mahomet</HI> had agitated &s;o with <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> that he was upon the march with a potent Army, and that many ve&s;&s;els were already arrived at <HI>Ar|zille, Oran, Tanger,</HI> and <HI>Cerote,</HI> forts on the <HI>African</HI> coa&s;t in the Chri&s;tians hands: whereof <HI>Muley Malouco</HI> being advertized, made diligent preparation, and fir&s;t takes a march into the mountains again&s;t the <HI>Arabians,</HI> whom he di&s;tru&s;ted to be of his nephews party. He took cour&s;e to di&s;-arm them totally, and di&s;abled them of &s;ixteen thou&s;and good hor&s;es, for which he promi&s;ed good pay|ment, and mounted on them &s;o many mu&s;queteers with red caps; thus &s;ecuring the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and blocking up all avenues that they might not come upon his back. By this means having rai&s;ed an Army of &s;ixty thou&s;and hor&s;e, he advanced to <HI>Alca&s;&s;our,</HI> or <HI>Al|ca&s;quinir,</HI> about fifteen leagues from <HI>Arache,</HI> with his Brother <HI>Muley Hamet. Don Seba&s;tian</HI> on the other &s;ide appeared there with about &s;ixteen or eighteen thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, <HI>Portu|gue&s;e, Ca&s;tillians, Italians,</HI> and <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>On the 4. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the battaile was given, wherein the King of <HI>Portugall</HI> was &s;lain, and his Army wholly defeated: <HI>Mahomet</HI> fly|ing to <HI>Arzille</HI> to &s;ave him&s;elf, was drowned, fording the River of <HI>Mucazen,</HI> which runs by <HI>Arache,</HI> though bravely mounted. Above twelve thou&s;and Chri&s;tians fell there, be&s;ides many pri&s;o|ners, among&s;t whom were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00. women, and 200. &s;ucking infants. I was my &s;elf at this fight, with about three&s;core <HI>Mar&s;eillians</HI> more, whereof few came off. <HI>Malouco</HI> dyed of &s;ickne&s;&s;e in his time of triumph, and his young Brother <HI>Muly Hamet</HI> &s;ucceeded, who&s;e race continues to this day. I &s;aw the body of the King of <HI>Portugall</HI> carried away in a che&s;t, filled with un&s;lack'd lime to pre&s;erve it, begged of King <HI>Muley Hamet,</HI> by <HI>Andrietto Ga&s;paro Cor&s;e,</HI> his great favourite, who &s;ent it to <HI>Lisbone,</HI> for which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ent him a rich pre&s;ent in recompen&s;e, and interred it in the Church of <HI>Belen.</HI> 'Tis true, I under&s;tood &s;ince by &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;laves, that this was the body of a <HI>Swi&s;&s;e,</HI> and that the King being beaten from his Hor&s;e e&s;caped: and indeed &s;ome years after one appeared, who &s;aid he was the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and &s;hewed &s;everall te&s;timonies, but how&s;oever he was executed in <HI>Spain</HI> as an Impo&s;tor, after &s;o many who de&s;cribed this battle at large, and faithfully, I will content my &s;elf to &s;ay onely what I &s;aw. Thus then, the whole <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Cavalry being landed, drew up in two &s;quadrons. <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Cordoua,</HI> Commander in chief of the one advanced towards <HI>Alca&s;&s;ar,</HI> where the <HI>Moores</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="153">
attack'd them &s;everall times, and &s;tanding ob&s;tinately to their pikes broke their ranks, but the Chri&s;tians falling on with their pi&s;tols, <HI>Azimut</HI> their Commander in chief was &s;lain, then the re&s;t made no great re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o as the <HI>Moores</HI> not u&s;ed to this &s;ort of arms, fell into di&s;order and fled, which put &s;uch vanity in the Chri&s;tians, that they lay in the field, in hope to take <HI>Alca&s;&s;ar,</HI> five leagues from <HI>Arache,</HI> being both between two Rivers, a league di&s;tant one from another. <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> to prevent &s;urprizall by night, &s;urrounded his Army with waggons, carts, baggage, uten&s;ils barrels, and all the train of Artillery.</P>
<P><HI>Don Aluaro Perez</HI> led the Van, with five hundred hor&s;e, and twelve hundred Land&s;quenets, guarded on the right with the River, on the left with pikes, barely armed with a cor&s;let, and a thou&s;and Mu&s;queteers in the head, who marched the fa&s;ter to get at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Army, to provoke the <HI>Moores</HI> to fall upon them with hope of being releived by ten thou&s;and <HI>Arabians</HI> under the command of <HI>Armabachi</HI> then with the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> who &s;u&s;pended to declare them&s;elves for hazarding their fortunes, wives, and children they knew not how, for they had intelligence how the King of <HI>Fez</HI> had drained their Countrey, and blocked up the avenues to hinder relief coming to his Nephew. Hereupon they made a &s;tand, re&s;olving not to declare them&s;elves, adverti&s;ing <HI>Soliman</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Armabachi,</HI> that they would &s;tand Neuters, till time &s;hould advi&s;e them what to do, under the conduct of <HI>Amet Sarran,</HI> a prudent Commander, who had engaged to <HI>Malouco,</HI> that he would be ready at his command.</P>
<P>But <HI>Courco Abrahin</HI> who led five thou&s;and <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> hor&s;e being young and gallant, ambitious to do &s;omething of noble, &s;ent to <HI>Sarran,</HI> that if he would &s;econd him he would give battaile, but <HI>Sarran</HI> an&s;wered 'twas no policy to attack an Army well rang'd and defended with Artillery, without more po&s;&s;ibility: &s;o that day he did nothing, onely four <HI>Moores</HI> well mounted made a bravado.</P>
<P>I went along with one <HI>Hercules,</HI> a Cannoneer, and <HI>John Sa&s;&s;ello</HI> a <HI>Mar&s;eillian,</HI> to view the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Army, which was a noble pro&s;pect, all we di&s;liked was the burthen&s;ome number of women and children.</P>
<P>The 13. of <HI>July, Aluarez</HI> about day break &s;pied <HI>Courco Abrahin</HI> with his five thou&s;and <HI>Moores:</HI> and with a grand &s;tratagem drew them under &s;hot of all his Mu&s;queteers, and five field-pieces, that made a great &s;laughter. The&s;e <HI>Moores</HI> were all defeated, and their Leader &s;lain, to the great glory of <HI>Don Aluarez,</HI> and Captain <HI>Balliotin,</HI> Commander of the Lan&s;quenets, <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> view'd all the combat with exceeding delight, embraced <HI>Aluarez</HI> return|ing with victory, and gave him a rich Rubie in a Jewel, &s;et round vvith diamonds, which he tied him&s;elf in his hat, and to <HI>Bana&s;tarin</HI> and to <HI>Baliotin</HI> Captains of the Lan&s;quenets, and Arquebu&s;iers, to
<PB N="294" REF="154">
each a rich Diamond. The <HI>Moori&s;h King</HI> gave likewi&s;e to <HI>Al|varez</HI> his Cimeterre of an excellent temper, and a &s;cabbard of great price. Of the&s;e five thou&s;and hor&s;e, not above three hundred e&s;caped; of Chri&s;tians, there dyed not above twenty, and fifty wounded.</P>
<P><HI>Malouco</HI> hearing of this defeat was exceedingly troubled, and blam'd <HI>Sarran,</HI> that he came not in with relief. Hereupon he draws his Army towards the Sea &s;ide; but the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dour advi&s;ed him rather to take cour&s;e with the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who had engaged to bring in to Mahomet fifty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and to fall upon them before they got into a body. He accepted the Councell and marched again&s;t them, and put the country of <HI>Loy|a&s;&s;an</HI> and others to fire and &s;word: The <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;ubmitted, and promi&s;ed him all obedience, but he being cautious, and fearing their perfidiou&s;ne&s;&s;e, took all their hor&s;es, and left the men for the next harve&s;t, &s;o with dexterity he prevented that danger.</P>
<P>Thence he returned towards the Sea-coa&s;t, and began already to be ill di&s;po&s;ed, which proceeded from exce&s;&s;ive con&s;tipation or Melancholy: from the beginning of his &s;ickne&s;&s;e he never came on hor&s;e-back, but went ever in his Littar. He was a benigne and courteous Prince, affectionate to his friends, without &s;tate or di&s;tance, &s;peaking affably to them, and rendring &s;alutes with great civility. But on the other &s;ide he was cruell to his enemies, in ju|&s;tice rigorous, but chiefly to &s;uch as injured the Sutlers, as to a boy who putting his hand into a pannier, &s;tole three dates, the Sutler complaining, he cau&s;ed three of his fingers to be cut off. Some who had intention to turn to Mahomet, he made them be ram|med into a Cannon, and fire &s;et to it.</P>
<P>The fourth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at that time when the prodigious Planet menaced <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Marocca,</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> having made his prayers, and received a benediction from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Co|nimbria,</HI> mounted on a white hor&s;e capari&s;on'd with gold and green, of about five and twenty years of age, with &s;omething a ri|&s;ing no&s;e, a good &s;tature, his lip a little hanging, went through all the Army, to animate and encourage the &s;ouldiers. Some &s;ay the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Conimbria</HI> dreamed the night before, that the battel was lo&s;t, and that they were all &s;laves, as it came to pa&s;&s;e; and that upon this alone he &s;ent his trea&s;ure, and all things he had of value to <HI>Arzille,</HI> which &s;erved for his ran&s;om afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Malouco</HI> the &s;ame day about eleven in the fore-noon, left his Littar and mounted on hor&s;e-back, ve&s;ted in a rich robe of cloth of gold, wrought with a folliage, a Cimeterre at his &s;ide, his &s;addle &s;et over with precious &s;tones, and thus went from rank to rank, encouraging his men to combat. His Army marched in good order like a half-cre&s;&s;ent, drums of the <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> very &s;mall, beat, and the Fifes founded a &s;hriller &s;ound then the Trumpet. 'Twas thought the battels &s;hould have been given on Sunday the third, but 'twas
<PB N="295" REF="154">
defer'd to the fourth, and <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> were advi&s;ed to &s;tay battel till the approach of night, becau&s;e the <HI>Arabians</HI> pro|mi&s;ed to come over to them, and leave <HI>Malouco,</HI> which proved fal&s;e, and they were &s;o di&s;appointed. King <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> was armed, as the day before, in green Armes, upon a white hor&s;e one of the be&s;t in <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moores</HI> Army was rampar'd on the left hand with the Ri|ver. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> thought him&s;elf &s;ure of the <HI>Arabians</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;pecially of <HI>Melouco's</HI> Van-guard, which was all of <HI>Arabians,</HI> and for this rea&s;on &s;tayed till night, that they might not be perceived. 'Twas in a field of above two large leagues every way, without ei|ther tree or &s;tone. Before the Van-guard marched, the Light-hor&s;e-men mounted on the <HI>Arabians</HI> hor&s;es, compo&s;ing the point of the Cre&s;&s;ent, and were wholly cut off with the Cannon. The <HI>Arabians</HI> &s;eeing this rout, thought good to do the like; but not perceiving a man of the other Battalia's fall, they &s;et a good face on it, by force <HI>Muley Hammet</HI> being at hand to in&s;tigate them. The battail at length grew hot, and the <HI>Arabians</HI> performed nothing of what they had promi&s;ed: <HI>Molouco</HI> employed the re|maining houres of his life in giving order for victory: The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>Moor</HI> remained on the ground as well as <HI>Mo|louco,</HI> the one &s;lain, the other drowned, and the third dead of in|firmity in his Littar, <HI>Hamet</HI> remaining only victorious, and heire of all.</P>
<P><HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> did wonders in his own per&s;on, but overpowred with number, he hung his handkercher on the point of a lance in token of yeilding, but the ra&s;cally <HI>Moores</HI> ignorant of this pra|ctice, run upon him, and tho&s;e that &s;tood with him, and put them all to the Sword. The &s;laughter was great, but chiefly of tho&s;e who went along with the baggage, who were as many or more then all the Army.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome mingled them&s;elves among&s;t the dead, to &s;ave their lives. 'Twas &s;ad to &s;ee 200. &s;ucking children, and above 800. women, boyes, and girles, who followed father and mother, think|ing to inhabit this country, who had loaded chains and cords to fetter the <HI>Moores,</HI> and &s;erved for the Chri&s;tians them&s;elves, of whom there are 17. thou&s;and pri&s;oners, the two hundred infants, and the eight hundred women not reckon'd. As to the kingdom of <HI>Fez</HI> or <HI>Marocca,</HI> heretofore <HI>Mauritania,</HI> or <HI>Tingitania,</HI> 'tis of va&s;t extent, and among&s;t others hath the two potent towns of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Marocca.</HI></P>

<P>The hou&s;es for the greate&s;t part are of brick, with Towres and Tarra&s;&s;es, where the women prune them&s;elves in the evening, for they &s;eldom &s;tirr abroad.

<P>This Town was built, or rather augmented by a Prince, called <HI>Man&s;or</HI> in the year 1024. &s;cituate in a Plain invironed with Date-trees. He built there a Magnificent <HI>Mo&s;quee</HI>; there is the high tower with three Spires, on which &s;tand three balls of gold, of twenty thou&s;and <HI>Miticales,</HI> or two hundred and twen|ty five pounds weight a piece, <HI>Muley Malouco</HI> would have had them for his warres, but the Inhabitants would not permit him, whereupon the <HI>Jani&s;&s;aries</HI> that came from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to a&s;|&s;i&s;t <HI>Malouco,</HI> made &s;ome Mu&s;quet &s;hot, and pierced them in divers places.

me I &s;hould not be afraid, for there was no danger. He ki&s;&s;ed his hand, and took mine with many kindne&s;&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions, that he could not have &s;lept if he had not &s;een me, entreating me to come to him on the morrow, to communicate to me a matter of impor|tance. A&s;king how he came &s;o perfect in our tongue, he told me he was once &s;ervant to one <HI>Charbi</HI> at <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> that he had had bu&s;ine&s;&s;e with my father, whom he named, and my brother: that he had been a &s;lave 9 years, then redeemed him&s;elf. On the morrow he was with us at our fir&s;t &s;tirring, and we took a walk together, and then he invited us to dinner to his hou&s;e, which was very noble. I demanded of him how a per&s;on of &s;uch quality had remained &s;o long in &s;lavery: he told me that for five years his ran&s;om being a thou&s;and duckets was lo&s;t. He had four hor&s;es in his &s;table, his lodging chamber was gilt, and had many other very fair rooms. He had one wife only, and he would never marry other, but would live like a Chri&s;tian. His wife was fair in perfection. He gave me high commendations to his wife that &s;he might be courteous to me, and &s;he was therefore very civill to us: He &s;hewed us all his hou&s;e, and a fair Library of well-bound books, and &s;hewed me how the <HI>Africans</HI> had been Lords of a great part of the world, &s;hewing me a Book titled <HI>Albazer</HI> full of curio&s;ities, and hi&s;tories of the renowned <HI>Africans,</HI> as <HI>Hannibal, Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, Septimus Seve|rus</HI> Emperour, and many other Kings, Princes, and Bi&s;hops, as St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> and others.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him why he followed not the Law of &s;o many holy Bi&s;hops. He told me he was not &s;o far divided, and that in their <HI>Alcoran Mahomet</HI> confe&s;&s;es that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was greater than he: that he met him in the &s;ixth heaven and humbled him&s;elf to him, be&s;eeching him to pray to God for him, which he never did to other Prophets, who all beg of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to pray to God for them. So as this man wanted nothing of a Chri&s;tian but Bapti&s;me; and told us that having paid his ran&s;om, if his Ma&s;ter <HI>Churbi</HI> the Con|&s;ul had not pre&s;&s;ed him to marry a young widow whom he dear|ly lov'd, he had willingly become Chri&s;tian. He was a man very upright, wi&s;e, and vertuous, and if he would marry other wives, of the chiefe&s;t in Town he might have plenty. He told me as a &s;ecret that the Governour of <HI>Arzille,</HI> who was in heart of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> opinion, would have given his daughter in marriage, if he would have become Chri&s;tian, he had likewi&s;e a particular affection for Chri&s;tians.

<P>Being departed from <HI>Sequeline,</HI> we cro&s;&s;ed the Mountains of <HI>Ziz,</HI> which takes beginning at the &s;kirts of <HI>Mezetazu,</HI> towards the We&s;t, and terminates at <HI>Telde,</HI> towards <HI>Numidia.</HI> The <HI>Arabians</HI> call it <HI>Segelme&s;&s;e,</HI> which are fifteen Mountains where the&s;e Serpen|tine people inhabit, which the people call <HI>Zanaga,</HI> who keep com|pany with &s;erpents, and have their gardens full of toads.

Another &s;ort called <HI>Zairan</HI> conjure tempe&s;ts, lightenings, hails, and other Meteors, which are hurtfull to fruits. I remem|ber I there &s;aw a Magician, who perceiving a horrid tempe&s;t ap|proaching in a thick black cloud, which would quite de&s;troy their <HI>Seytume,</HI> or olives then in flower, he made a hole in the ground, and with certain words urined in it, which diverted the &s;torm to another part: yet they have another &s;ort they call <HI>Machabell,</HI> who &s;ay they can cure all di&s;ea&s;es in cattle. Others called <HI>Sadahachar,</HI> who have power over devils, and can compell them to any place they command them: They have alwaies one among&s;t them, and they call them white devils. Others very &s;kilfull in <HI>Geomancy,</HI> who can &s;hew &s;pirits in a bright ba&s;on like a looking-gla&s;&s;e, which re|pre&s;ents what is de&s;ired: Others they have that cau&s;e bea&s;ts or men to langui&s;h and die; but this la&s;t &s;ort is not onely among&s;t Infi|dels, I have &s;een them likewi&s;e among&s;t Chri&s;tians. For being once at <HI>Seville</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> I knew a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Limner excellent in his art, who langui&s;ht by this means, betwitch'd by a famous &s;trumpet cal|led <HI>Segnora Maria de Villara,</HI> who would have &s;erved a Comrade of his in like &s;ort, with certain biskets wherewith &s;he entertained him, whereof one was charm'd and the other not; but he &s;u&s;pect|ing &s;ome villany, cunningly conveyed it to her own plate, and took another. Afterwards &s;he doubting nothing gave him one to pre|&s;ent to his wife, with a curious pur&s;e. But he returning home made triall on a dog, who immediately fell to howling, and dyed. Mean while the Bi&s;ket which the Curtizan had taken unawares, began to work, whereupon perceiving her &s;elf lo&s;t, &s;he &s;ent for her friend, who acknowledged he had given her the mor&s;el, ignorant what it was. Hereupon &s;he de&s;ired him for a la&s;t &s;ervice, he would go to a certain place in a garden out of Town, and cut a cord which he &s;hould find tied to a tree; which taking &s;ome friends with him he did, and found a toad tied by the leg at the end of the cord, and he had no &s;ooner cut it but the Curtizan died. I was
<PB N="303" REF="158">
in <HI>Sevill</HI> when this happened, and &s;eeing the body of this woman going to buriall, he who was the principal actor told me the &s;tory, for we lodg'd in the &s;ame hou&s;e. And his wife upon this &s;trange ef|fect dur&s;t no longer wear the pur&s;e &s;he &s;ent her.</P>
<P>In order to this I will relate you two other examples of Sorce|rers, which happened in our Countrey of <HI>Provence,</HI> one of a Shoe|maker at <HI>Aix.</HI> On the day he was married a witch tied a knot up|on a point, with certain words, and laid it on the Altar in time of Ma&s;&s;e, and afterwards put it in a hole. For five or &s;ix years the&s;e people could never live together, till the witch being apprehended before her death, confe&s;&s;ed where the point was, which was found together with cro&s;&s;es, caracters, and &s;acred words: The witch was burn'd alive, and the &s;hoemakers wife afterwards became with child.</P>
<P>The other of a <HI>Mar&s;ellian,</HI> who being in love with a maid, whom her friends would not con&s;ent &s;hould marry him, was advi&s;ed to go to <HI>Baile de Luc,</HI> a grand Sorcerer, who made him make an offering to Sathan, then drawing a circle on the ground, he divided it in &s;even parts, and in each placed a character, &s;ignifying the name of a Devil, who &s;hould appear to him in what form he would, and carry him whither&s;oever he de&s;ired. But the other not being over confident named the form of man, but the Sorcerer would have the form of a bea&s;t. In fine, the other for money procured him to let him have the caracter of a Demon with him to his own home, to make tryal of, and made choice of the name <HI>Leviathan,</HI> and about midnight went to do this work at his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es door, the Magician having told him 'twould work the more forcibly. He then laid the Caracter upon a &s;tone and on his knees made his pray|ers to <HI>Leviathan</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his enterprize.</P>
<P>He &s;aid this prayer five times, then on a &s;udden the devill ap|peared in a hideous and horrible form, which the poor man having not courage to endure, fell in a trance on the ground for three hours together. Afterwards returning to him&s;elf, he got up, took his ticket, and returned home &s;ad and vext at his want of courage. He ca&s;t the Caracter in the fire, whence broke three &s;uch claps of thunder, as if the hou&s;e &s;hould have &s;unk to hell. The Father, Mother, and Si&s;ters ran to &s;ee what the matter was, but he &s;eemed to know nothing. The poor man being in this di&s;tre&s;&s;e, came to me, for he was my friend, and telling me the proceedings a&s;ked my advice, with mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;peeches, &s;aying, that to gain his love he did not care to be damned. Whereupon I advi&s;ed him in the be&s;t &s;ort I could, telling him that this way though he &s;hould gain his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, nothing but mi&s;ery could befall him; then I made him promi&s;e me to go together to a <HI>Capucin</HI> of my acquaintance to reconcile him, and receive his diabolical renunciation; but this mi&s;erable man came not according to appointment, per&s;i&s;ting in his accur&s;ed re&s;olution.</P>

He made me an exact relation of the whole Court and <HI>Seraglio,</HI> out of which I collected &s;ome memorials that I lo&s;t. I can humbly &s;ay, God made me an in&s;tru|ment to regain this man, who came back to <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> while his Father and Mother were yet alive, where he was reconciled to the Church, but &s;ometime after going to &s;ea, was by the <HI>Turks</HI> retaken, and put to death. Of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> I remember he told me that within the &s;econd gate upon the left hand is the Princes kitchin, not comparable to tho&s;e in our Royal Palaces; he reckon'd all the Officers to me, which I &s;et not down. Beyond that is the great hall, or chamber of the <HI>Agas Capigis,</HI> or <HI>Cadun,</HI> the door-guards, a different office from the <HI>Chaous,</HI> who are exempt from guarding. Of this guard there are a great number, divided by thirty to a Company. The third gate opens into gardens, &s;et with dates, and trees of other &s;orts; at the bottom whereof is a fair Subterranean apartment, &s;umptuou&s;ly &s;tored with riches, on the top &s;tands a golden Mund, and on that a Cre&s;&s;ant. Here the Prince bathes in hot &s;ea&s;ons, and &s;ometimes eats; here he gives audience to Emba&s;&s;adours, conducted through divers gates and Courts, for o&s;tentation of the State and magnificence of the Pa|lace, the rich columns, Mo&s;aick Tape&s;tries, &amp;c. He gives audience to Emba&s;&s;adours onely twice; when they arrive, and when they depart, and then for a &s;peciall favour reaches them his right hand to ki&s;&s;e. In the middle of the chamber &s;tands a great globe of Chry&s;tal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;crip|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the <HI>Serag|lio.</HI></NOTE> exceeding delightfull to the eye, for the diver&s;ity of co|lours it pre&s;ents, enriched round with fair diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

He told me the Ladies would blandi&s;h him exceedingly, and that there was one who daily &s;aid the ro&s;ary of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, and was daugh|ter to the Prince of <HI>Natolia.</HI> The <HI>Sultan</HI> keeps ten pages, as grooms of his chamber to dre&s;&s;e and undre&s;&s;e him, who &s;erve not by quarter, but attend the Prince continually, as Pages of honour: They are cul'd out of many more, and ordinarily are cho&s;en by their Phy&s;nomy, or good face. 'Tis the office of one of the&s;e to go every morning to the <HI>Cha&s;na,</HI> or Trea&s;urer for fourty duckets to put in the Grand <HI>Seniors</HI> pocket for his charity, and bounty; at night when he goes to bed, all the money left in his pockets the Pages of honour divide among&s;t them, where they often find the &s;um compleat, the grand <HI>Seniors</HI> affairs not allowing him lei&s;ure to think of it. They fetch every day the like &s;um for his &s;ports. The&s;e Pages watch all night by the Prince, two and two by turns, and have <HI>Flambeaus</HI> burning, till Sun ri&s;ing that the Prince ri&s;es: for then from a high &s;teeple the <HI>Dalliman</HI> calls every one to pray|ers. The Prince a&s;&s;oon as he is ready goes to the Mo&s;quee, and if he plea&s;e, takes his Pages of honour to attend him; &s;ometimes to take the air he goes on hor&s;e to a Mo&s;quee more remote, and then is attended in hand&s;om order. Furthermore the Porter or <HI>Capaigis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ba&s;haw Abrahor</HI> the ma&s;ter of hor&s;e.</NOTE> hath authority to puni&s;h any that &s;hall rai&s;e any broiles in the Palace, and &s;uffers no man to go in with armes.

<P>I laid in Merchandizes proper for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as <HI>Camlots</HI> of the Ea&s;t, cloth, corall, and two hundred crowns in gold, upon let|ters of exchange to <HI>Hierome Viguer</HI> of <HI>Chativa,</HI> and an hundred pi&s;tols, I depo&s;ited with <HI>Noe Mene&s;tier,</HI> which I lo&s;t; yet he an hone&s;t man; for this <HI>Viguier</HI> a Spaniard, u&s;ed &s;uch &s;leights and delays, that I was con&s;trained to quit all, by a misfortune which befell me. For waiting for my money at his Bro|thers hou&s;e one <HI>Emanuele,</HI> one evening coming out of a Church, there &s;tood di&s;cour&s;ing a companie of Cannons, who &s;eeing me in a <HI>French</HI> dre&s;&s;e, according to that degenerous cu|&s;tome of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> began to affront me, which I waved with patience; and telling them how injurious 'twas to abu&s;e a &s;tranger thus meerly pa&s;&s;ing by them, they wanted not much to come from words to blows with me and my man: Here|upon I complained to the Duke of <HI>Gandia,</HI> who gave me no other &s;atisfaction than to refer me to the Bi&s;hop, from whom I returned with as little &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;contented I left the Town, and removed to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> by the way I lighted upon one of the&s;e venerable Cannons travailing for <HI>Valencia,</HI> well mounted, and gla&s;&s;es before his eyes to pre|&s;erve them from the wind; now I having this opportunity for my revenge, gave him &s;uch a buffet that I broke his gla&s;&s;e, and &s;ent him &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;e to the ground: then upon the &s;pur doubled my pace to <HI>Guadix,</HI> where 'twas my hard fortune to loo&s;e a bill of exchange I had for cloth I &s;old at <HI>Valence.</HI> thence by <HI>Granado</HI> I went to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where &s;ome &s;mall negotiations be|ing di&s;patched, I returned for <HI>Provence</HI>: But having &s;ome prick in con&s;cience for my treaty of the Cannon of <HI>Gandia,</HI> I went to a Prie&s;t to confe&s;&s;e my &s;elf, who con&s;idering the &s;pe|cies of my fault, turned me over to the Bi&s;hop, who ab&s;ol|ved me, and for penance obliged me to make a pilgrimage to <HI>Rome</HI>: I performed it, and coming to Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church, to confe&s;&s;e me to one of the Penitentiaries, with long &s;laves, by ill luck he prooved a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and under&s;tanding I had beaten a Cannon of <HI>Gandia,</HI> was much concerned, how&s;oever gave me ab&s;olution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>At this time there was an Almner of the Popes, who had the di&s;po&s;ing of ten or twelve thou&s;and duckets to the poor year|ly, and as they &s;ay, re&s;erved a good &s;hare for him&s;elf; &s;o as in few yeares he became exceeding rich, but very avaritious: Whereupon &s;ome good fellows there, were re&s;olved to &s;hew him a trick, and partake with him; for this purpo&s;e one of them opens a &s;hop of &s;mall commodities, with &s;ome curio&s;ities and antick me|dals of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>This Almner as he came from Church, went every day to
<PB N="315" REF="164">
conver&s;e with this new Merchant, who &s;till &s;hewed him rarities, whereof &s;ometimes he bought, &s;ometimes not. At la&s;t when their familiaritie was confirmed, behold another of the pack, di&s;gui&s;ed like a &s;lave, an iron plate about his neck, and a red cap, &s;tands to beg at St. <HI>Peters</HI> porch, and as the Alm|ner came by, be&s;ought a charity of him: the other &s;ee|ing him of a good a&s;pect, a&s;ked him what he was? who an&s;wered he was a poore Gentleman newly come out of &s;la|very, and having his con&s;cience burthened, de&s;ired he would hear his confe&s;&s;ion. So entring the Church, this Gallant told him a long &s;tory, how he had been divers years captive to <HI>Dragut Rais</HI> that famous Pirate, that at length he made him groom of his Chamber, and tru&s;ted him with all his money and jewels, and that his Ma&s;ter being &s;lain at the &s;iege of <HI>Malta,</HI> he took a jewell of extraordinary value, and a &s;um of duckets, and came with the Fleet to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he met with means to get into Chri&s;tendom, and return to his Countrey with his wealthy prize.</P>
<P>The Almner was on fire, to have a &s;ight of the rich piece, and told him if it were a thing of that value, he would pro|cure his holine&s;&s;e to buy it: The &s;lave then conjuring him to &s;ecrecy by the name of God, &s;hewed him a fawcet Chry&s;tall, arti|ficially coloured with Dragons bloud, which made it of an admi|rable lu&s;tre; wherewith the Almner dazled, de&s;ired him he might &s;hew it to a Merchant a friend of his, of knowledge in &s;uch things, &s;o they went together to the Merchant, who viewing the jewell, made unu&s;uall admirations, as at an exce&s;&s;ive trea&s;ure, telling him 'twas worth many thou&s;and duckets; whereby his longing growing &s;tronger, after many offers and refu&s;als be|twixt the &s;lave and him, they at length bargained for two and twenty thou&s;and crowns, which he paid upon the naile: Whereupon the Merchant &s;huts up &s;hop, packs away, and vani&s;hes with the &s;lave, never to be heard of.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Almner was &s;o &s;well'd with his purcha&s;e, that he could not contain him&s;elf, imagining by this means he might arrive at any office or dignity what&s;oever, and fancied him&s;elf Pope already, with this Carbuncle in his <HI>Tiara</HI>: For &s;ome dayes he concealed it, not di&s;covering the lea&s;t to his very neare&s;t friends. At length meeting with two Gold&s;miths of his old acquaintance, he &s;hewed it them, and would know their opinion of the value, or near the matter; who perceiving it a counterfeit carbuncle, laughed heartily, and &s;aid 'twas a pretty Chry&s;tall, and might be worth &s;ome few realls, which &s;o &s;troke the good man, that overcome with grief and vexation, he betook him&s;elf to his bed, whence he never ro&s;e again. Thus was the good man abu&s;ed by the knavi&s;h cheats.</P>
<P>To &s;econd this, I &s;hall tell you of an exploite was put
<PB N="316" REF="165">
upon me in this very voyage. I intended for <HI>Naples,</HI> to buy &s;ome hor&s;es, for which purpo&s;e I had a good hand&s;om &s;um of money I had taken for pearls I brought from <HI>Li&s;bone,</HI> and &s;old to the Mar|que&s;&s;e of <HI>Orai&s;on,</HI> which I had put in two bags, whereof one I ever carried about me. One day pa&s;&s;ing through the market <HI>Co|lonna,</HI> I ob&s;erved a Gold&s;mith well furni&s;hed with jewels, and ha|ving cheapned a good diamond of about four or five carrats weight, and a good lu&s;ter, by rea&s;on the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mar&s;eills</HI> de&s;i|red me to buy him one if I met with a good bargain; we agreed for three&s;core and odd pi&s;tols, which I laid down; but he re|canting and demanding more, I withdrew my money. Upon this comes in a man in good fa&s;hion, his beard white, and a black vel|vet cap, and told me in private if I would buy a good diamond, or other jewels, he would &s;hew me tho&s;e were good, and at a rea&s;onable rate. I took the man for &s;ome Senatour, or per|&s;on of quality, and followed him, though the Gold&s;mith pul|led me by the &s;leeve, to come into his &s;hop again. As we went along, my Gentleman entertained me with di&s;cour&s;e of &s;everall jewels he had at his Chamber, without Port <HI>Popolo,</HI> at la&s;t he had brought me to a place out of all wayes, near the <HI>Palle Malle,</HI> by the wall &s;ide; I began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;|chief when I heard a Faquin by the way bid farewell, &s;uch a one calling him by his name; and as I was thinking to take my leave of him, and go back again, I was &s;eized upon by four or five Ruffians, who &s;et a dagger to my brea&s;t, and made me deliver my pur&s;e, and the bag I had about me, and my guide vani&s;hed &s;o as I could &s;ee him no more.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;erable condition I came back to <HI>Rome,</HI> full of &s;hame and &s;adne&s;&s;e, and though I &s;poke not a word of it, yet my misfortune was immediately divulged through all <HI>Rome,</HI> how I had been cheated by one in &s;uch cloaths, who was known and famous for &s;uch a one, he was not long after apprehended and meeting me I knew him not at all, having cut his hair and changed his cloathes, and &s;toutly denyed the fact. They &s;hewed me &s;ome pieces of gold, which I claimed as my own, but that was all I could get.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding he was within few dayes after, with two of his Comrades hanged, convicted of divers other robbe|ries.</P>
<P>Being upon return to <HI>Mar&s;eills</HI> I made a digre&s;&s;ion towards the river <HI>Genes,</HI> and <HI>Malta,</HI> and by rea&s;on the plague was at <HI>Martigues,</HI> I could not without difficulty be admitted into <HI>Ville Franche,</HI> to take a bill of health to cro&s;&s;e the River <HI>Genes,</HI> where they are ex|ceeding &s;evere upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The day after I arrived, coming abroad two houres before day to take fre&s;h ayr, I heard a doleful voyce coming, as I thought, from <HI>Capo Ferino,</HI> that cryed, Alas, kill me not, and take all I
<PB N="317" REF="165">
have; and after &s;ome profound groanes cea&s;e. The day brought the matter to light, and it appears a poor man was murthered by &s;ome of <HI>Nice,</HI> per&s;ons of quality, and free from &s;u&s;pition.</P>
<P>For the&s;e people with the Ca&s;tle-Frigot went aboard a Bark, and having put all to the &s;word, and pilladged, &s;unk it: but God for his ju&s;t judgement permitted him, who &s;ate at helme to leap into the water, and being ignorant of &s;wimming, they &s;ay a <HI>Dolphin</HI> came betwixt his legges and carried him to &s;hore, then knocking at the Ca&s;tle Gate, he was brought wet as he was, be|fore the Governour, to whom he related, that &s;ome with the Ca|&s;tle Frigot had boarded their ve&s;&s;ell, and u&s;ed them as I told you. The Governour amazed at the matter, called for him who had charge of the Frigot, to know to whom he had delivered it, who told him that &s;uch and &s;uch had taken it without asking, becau&s;e he had ever allowed them the priviledge.</P>
<P>The Governour put on his clothes and went to the &s;hore, where he found his Frigot drawn on land, and a boy wa&s;hing away &s;ome blood which was in it; for it &s;eems one of the Bark en|deavouring to e&s;cape, they took him, killed him, and threw him into the &s;ea. The Governour quietly a&s;ked what he was doing, he cunningly an&s;wered, they had in the night taken a great Fi&s;h, and that he was wa&s;hing away the blood. In the in&s;tant came he who had taken away the Frigot, to give good morrow to the Go|vernour, whom the Marriner immediately knew, and cryed out, that was he who had done the fact; whereupon the Gentleman, with two others, were brought to the Ca&s;tle, and upon triall ex|ecuted; two more e&s;caped, but being taken afterwards, paid the &s;ame rates, confe&s;&s;ing many more murthers, and ve&s;&s;els &s;unk; a|mong&s;t others, one wherein were 22. Religious, Je&s;uits, and Ca|pucins, whom they wrapt all in a &s;aile, and ca&s;t into the &s;ea, ha|ving pilladged what they had.</P>
<P>Thence we went to the Town of <HI>Genes</HI> in company of one <HI>Ala|ri,</HI> who had brought Hawkes to the King, and was going towards the Dutchy of <HI>&V;rbina,</HI> and being at <HI>Vay</HI> about three or four miles from <HI>Savona,</HI> they would not &s;uffer us on any conditions to pa&s;&s;e further, and of nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t turn our cour&s;e to the moun|tains of <HI>Mountferrat</HI> a country pe&s;ter'd with Bandits, and &s;uch other; in which pa&s;&s;age we were rob'd, and poor <HI>Alari</HI> lo&s;t above two thou&s;and franks which he had in his <HI>Valice.</HI></P>
<P>We met with many difficulties in this pa&s;&s;age, cro&s;&s;ing through narrow pa&s;&s;ages, fill'd up with &s;now by <HI>Alcare</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;oanta, Alex|andria, Placenta, Parma, Bolonia, Florence</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> where we arrived again&s;t the canonization of &s;ome Saints.</P>
<P>I got Letters from <HI>Sieur Guileo Falio</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour of <HI>Malta</HI> for &s;ome of the money owing me by the Grand Ma&s;ter. Thence we came to <HI>Naples</HI> where &s;uch a famine raigned, that the women in mutiny threw &s;tones at the Governour in his Coach, the Cardinal

and <HI>Sapata,</HI> who&s;e heeles &s;aved his life.</P>
<P>Then we took a Frigot for <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and by edict we were to take no more bread aboard then for half a day; I brought halfe a crowns worth, which I hid under the Planks: we had been un|done if it had been found, and the &s;ouldiers were exact &s;earchers; we &s;uffer'd &s;ome hard&s;hip when we had no bread to our meat, yet &s;o we pa&s;&s;ed two dayes intire: and putting in at the <HI>Pouilla,</HI> we could not among&s;t all the Fi&s;her-men for any money buy a mor&s;el, nor could have any thing among&s;t them but fi&s;h, which we after|wards trucked with a youth for bread, he had in re&s;erve; coming to <HI>A&s;illa,</HI> there we got bread; thence to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> through the Straight, &s;o dangerous for three or four leagues, where violence of the winde ca&s;t us on the Rocks. I got as well as I could to land, but &s;eeing &s;ome women left in the Bark, and ready to peri&s;h, I per&s;waded a young &s;hoomaker to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, nnd in effect, carry|ing them on our backs through the boy&s;terous waves, we got them &s;afe to &s;hore, for which afterwards they vouch&s;afed us not &s;o much as thanks.</P>
<P>At <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> I under&s;tood the <HI>Sieur de Mantis</HI> was with his Gal|lion at <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> being di&s;per&s;ed from his Admirall, and &s;even or eight more that put to &s;ea together at <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> and lighting up|on <HI>San&s;on</HI> the famous Pirat, with his &s;ix &s;hips they maintained a long fight, at length the S. <HI>Katharine</HI> torn with the Cannon &s;unk, and had it not been for <HI>Mon&s;ieur de l'I&s;le</HI> Captain of the Admiral, things had gone wor&s;e, but night parted them. <HI>De Mantis,</HI> his &s;hip repaired, intended to put to &s;ea to &s;eek his company, but there was news brought that <HI>San&s;on</HI> with &s;ix tall &s;hips waited his com|ing forth within Cannon &s;hot of the Haven mouth. Notwith|&s;tanding the oddes, <HI>de Mantis</HI> re&s;olved to fight him &s;ingle. 'Twas the admiration of all that &s;aw him hoy&s;e &s;ayle, looking on him as a frantick man, leading two or three hundred men to the Butchery, but this cen&s;ure was changed into applau&s;e, when they beheld him environed with &s;ix Turki&s;h &s;hips, who&s;e Cannons made the &s;ea &s;eem on fire&punc; of which engagement he cleared him|&s;elf, and re&s;tored them a bloody requitall.</P>
<P>His ve&s;&s;el endured &s;even hundred Cannon &s;hot, he lo&s;t twelve men, and the Turks above three hundred, be&s;ides what wound|ed. Thus victorious he returned to <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> where he was &s;a|luted with Cannon from all the Forts, and received into the town with an eminent honour and endearments, for his boldne&s;&s;e to attack the&s;e &s;ix men of war well mann'd and commanded by an Engli&s;h Renegado, the mo&s;t daring and de&s;perate Pirate on the &s;ea, who on the other &s;ide incen&s;ed with his di&s;grace, new mann'd his ve&s;&s;els, and reinforced them with two Gallies, and three hun|dred Mu&s;kettiers: The Grand Ma&s;ter <HI>de Vignacourt</HI> had intel|ligence of it, and <HI>de Mantis</HI> arriving at <HI>Malta,</HI> with his torne ve&s;&s;el, he repaired it; and at the &s;ame time the &s;hips of <HI>Mar&s;eills</HI>

coming from <HI>Suria,</HI> put in there. <HI>San&s;on</HI> having put to &s;ea, rode in &s;ight of <HI>Cape Pa&s;&s;aro,</HI> whereof the Grand Ma&s;ter gave notice to the <HI>Mar&s;ellian</HI> ve&s;&s;els laden with Merchandi&s;es. <HI>Mantis</HI> with his Admirall de&s;ign'd to fall upon the Pirats, whereupon I had &s;ome doubt if I were be&s;t go from <HI>Malta</HI> to <HI>Sicily,</HI> for 'twas ten dayes &s;ince I had my di&s;patches from the grand Ma&s;ter, who among&s;t other things had given me order to procure him three Gallies, built with all po&s;&s;ible expedition: I was loth to imbark with <HI>de Mantis,</HI> for the hazard he was engag'd in, though of favour he promi&s;ed me civill u&s;age, and I employed my be&s;t art, with the Ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, to carry me to <HI>Ligorne,</HI> and thence to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> promi&s;ing to load him with Gally timber for <HI>Sicily,</HI> &s;o as he re&s;olved accordingly, and that we might pa&s;&s;e unpercei|ved of the Turks, we &s;et not &s;aile till towards the approach of night. The grand Ma&s;ter being adverti&s;ed of our intention, &s;ent the Galley <HI>de la Religion,</HI> to call us in again, to my extream vexa|tion, having attended &s;o long for a pa&s;&s;age; But after I with my goods was &s;et a a&s;hore, the Ma&s;ter had liberty to go whither he plea&s;ed: The grand Ma&s;ter blam'd me exceedingly, for that the Turks lay then in the Channell, which was true, and in effect the ve&s;&s;el was taken next day, &s;o as I had the better luck to e&s;cape. Mean while the Gallion of <HI>Malta</HI> was making ready to execute the Kings command, and within fifteen dayes 'twas ready to be brought to the key, where <HI>de Mantis,</HI> with the <HI>Mar&s;eillian</HI> ve&s;&s;els &s;taid for it, to put out together for the coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI>&punc; at the &s;ame time the Gallies of <HI>Malta</HI> were departing for <HI>Sicily,</HI> and <HI>de Mantis,</HI> being in the Kings &s;hip, where he commanded for his Maje&s;ty, &s;aluted them not as they pa&s;&s;ed by, whereat the Knights were much in|cen&s;ed, looking upon it as a point of honour, adverti&s;ing the grand Ma&s;ter that he ought to fire all the Fort artillery upon him, and &s;ink him: But the prudent Lord managed the affaire with more moderation; and three dayes after the Galley being made rea|dy to launch, and being brought to the key, they a&s;ked <HI>de Montis</HI> who lay before the Palace, if he would &s;alute the Galley of <HI>Mal|ta,</HI> when it came to the key; and an&s;wering re&s;olutely no, there pa&s;&s;ed tart words from both &s;ides, with menaces they would make him do it per-force; but he per&s;i&s;ted, that he would lo&s;e his life fir&s;t, and that he had no &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion; and when they demanded to &s;ee his Commi&s;&s;ion, he refu&s;ed it in plaine termes.</P>
<P>But the grand Ma&s;ter de&s;irous to accommodate all this, found out this expedient: 'Tis an order of <HI>Malta,</HI> when the grand Ma|&s;ter comes upon the &s;hore, all the ve&s;&s;els in the Haven &s;alute him, with three volleyes of Cannon: now he gave order that about &s;even next morning the Gallion &s;hould fall down to the key, at which time he exactly contrived to appear upon the &s;hore, under pretence of going that way to Ma&s;&s;e at a &s;umptuous Church he had
<PB N="320" REF="167">
built with a faire fountaine before it, that ca&s;t up waters a Pike high.</P>
<P>His coming was no &s;ooner di&s;covered, but all the ve&s;&s;els pre|pared with ha&s;te to &s;alute him, and <HI>de Mantis</HI> the foremo&s;t, as a thing not to be deny'd gave him all his Cannon as well of his own ve&s;&s;el as of the Admiralls commanded by the <HI>Sieur d'I&s;le,</HI> and at the in&s;tant, all the other ve&s;&s;els did the like, &s;o as nothing was to be &s;een but &s;moak and fire. At that very point the Gallion with her blazing Standart, a S. <HI>John</HI> upon her poop, enter'd the mouth of the Haven, and thought this di&s;charge of Ordnance was a &s;a|lute for her, who returned them the like with her roaring Ord|nance, and thus by the prudence of the great Ma&s;ter, the difference was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>All this while <HI>San&s;on</HI> lay at &s;ea waiting for <HI>de Mantis,</HI> but having intelligence that the Gallion was of the company, he was better advi&s;ed, and knowing him&s;elf too weak to clo&s;e with us, hoy&s;ed &s;ayle and went his way, leaving a Galley to round us, and view our equipage, which came one morn before the Gallion, and made a turn in the head of the whole Fleet, the Gallion gave him two culverins, and <HI>de Mantis</HI> one, and with this &s;alute they parted, and we came &s;afe to <HI>Mar&s;eills.</HI></P>

'Tis inhabited as that of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> by a conflux of all nations, and the ayre be|ing unwhole&s;ome, they tran&s;port their infirm to an I&s;land two leagues di&s;tant called <HI>Praya,</HI> under a fine climate; the ayr healthful, and a commodious Haven betwixt two fair Rivers, which com|po&s;e two gulphs for harbours, one whereof is capable to containe many ve&s;&s;els in &s;ecurity, having before the mouth of it a little I&s;land, which guards it from the Maritime gu&s;ts, and the land lying high, defends it from windes by &s;hore. The other I&s;lan|ders affect to land at this Port, for that the re&s;t are pe&s;ter'd with &s;ands; and chiefly, <HI>Borlouento</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> where there is ever &s;ome ve&s;&s;el ca&s;t away. This I&s;le lyes clo&s;e upon the I&s;le of <HI>Mago,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Barlouento,</HI> and near to <HI>Bona Vi&s;ta,</HI> Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI> Saint <HI>Anthony,</HI> Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> Saint <HI>Lucie,</HI> and <HI>Fell,</HI> I&s;lands plentifull of Cattle, and Veni&s;on, the inhabitants applying them&s;elves onely to the cha&s;e, powder|ing the fle&s;h to &s;ell to &s;trangers, as the &s;kinnes like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>A little Ea&s;tward lyes the I&s;le <HI>del Fuego</HI> where they get as good wine as in the Canaries: next is the I&s;le of <HI>Braua,</HI> full of Veni&s;on, and wilde Beeves, whereof the Hydes are much &s;ought after, as being thick and tough. But to <HI>Guinea,</HI> the kingdome of the <HI>Jalofes</HI> is the fir&s;t, which beginnes North|ward at the River <HI>Senega,</HI> hath the Ocean on the We&s;t, the <HI>Jalofes</HI> called <HI>Fonlogageias,</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and the kingdom of <HI>Barbe&s;&s;in</HI> on the South: 'tis above a hundred and fifty leagues in length, of &s;everal commodities there is abundance; as gold and &s;ilver, which the natives conceale with all care from &s;trange|ers, though in dealing with them 'tis plain they have &s;tore, for that by whiles they produce &s;ome unfined. <HI>Taboucaton</HI> is their chief town. They are Blacks, but of good &s;hape, the women comely, round-faced, with eyes lively and attractive. The men are martial, dextrous in throwing a Javelin, which
<PB N="322" REF="168">
they will throw with as exact arm as we &s;hoot with our Gunnes. They ride on good hor&s;es, clothe as the <HI>African,</HI> in &s;hort bree|ches; a large <HI>Harnus,</HI> like a &s;heet of wollen covers them from head to foot, &s;hod with Date-tree Sandals. Vpon the coa&s;t they have the good and well-fortified Haven <HI>Beziguche,</HI> who&s;e entrance is &s;kreen'd with a fair I&s;land, much frequented with &s;trangers trading for the Indies. Here are many <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;etled among&s;t them, &s;ome married, others who think of no|thing but to heap up gold, living &s;omething after the <HI>Barba|rian.</HI> Many of the <HI>Blacks</HI> go naked, painted with di&s;&s;olved gold, their bodies carved, and drawn with a various tincture, as azure, red and yellow, which hold their life-time. There are among&s;t them maids adorned in the &s;ame manner, with great pendants in their ears, and their lips pierced like the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> they are generally libidinous, and given over to lu|xury. They who are thus engraved and inlay'd with paints, or juyce of hearbs, mo&s;t commonly do it for want, and this curio&s;iry is their attire.</P>
<P>Throughout the coa&s;t we find abundance of leather; wax, gold, &s;ilver ivory, and Amber-gris, which is the rea&s;on the <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Flemings,</HI> vi&s;it them &s;o oft.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jalofes</HI> are ea&s;ie of belief, and inclined to Chri&s;tianity; when they behold the Moon, they make &s;trong ejulations, with &s;orts of adoration: They adore yet &s;ome other Idols, which neverthele&s;&s;e fixe not their faith, the Mahometans on one &s;ide who impugne them with their law, on the other the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> preaching ours, and their own Prie&s;ts charming them with their delu&s;ions, and Idolatries. They make their &s;acrifices in the woods, making large hollow trees their Temples, where they keep many Idols to which they &s;acrifice pul&s;e, Mill, Rice; and the blood of bea&s;ts, who&s;e fle&s;h they eat.</P>
<P>The countrey of <HI>Bracala</HI> confines upon the rapide River of <HI>Gambra,</HI> which in the mouth is five good leagues over, &s;hips cannot enter it without a direct wind, with which they may advance three hundred leagues within the Countrey. This River cuts the great kingdome of <HI>Mandinga</HI> in the middle, peopled with Blacks, Idolaters, and abundance of Sorcerers, wicked, treacherous, and ba&s;e people. When they hold a coun&s;el ,tis in a cavern under ground to &s;ecure them from the prying of &s;trangers. They have &s;tore of Bra&s;il wood, as good as they of <HI>America,</HI> and upon the river many townes and villages where they mantain many ve&s;&s;els of Warre to encounter with any what&s;oever, but upon advantage. This countrey ends South|ward at the <HI>Cape</HI> of S. <HI>Mary</HI> 30. leagues from the river <HI>Chougala,</HI> by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> called S. <HI>Dominick.</HI> There are two nations of the &s;ame quality, the <HI>Barbachins</HI> called <HI>Ariates,</HI> and <HI>Falupes</HI> who trade in nothing but fi&s;h and cattel. They have an excellent
<PB N="323" REF="168" MS="y">
way to take the &s;ea-oxe, the &s;kins whereof they make great u&s;e of. They apply them&s;elves to till the &s;oyle, and get Mill, Rice, Pul&s;e, and other graine.</P>
<P>Out of this countrey comes the River <HI>Ca&s;amanca,</HI> bounded Northward with the <HI>Jabundos,</HI> on the South, with the people of <HI>Bemum,</HI> who on the Ea&s;t have the <HI>Ca&s;angas.</HI> Of late yeares the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have di&s;covered a way by an Arme of the Sea to <HI>Ca&s;angas,</HI> and for this purpo&s;e have erected a good Fort upon the cheek of it called S. <HI>Philips.</HI> This kingdome reaches North|ward to <HI>Jaren,</HI> and together do homage to the <HI>Sultan&s;hip</HI> of <HI>Mandinga,</HI> rich in gold and &s;ilver, having excellent mines.</P>
<P>The Prince keeps his Court in the Town of <HI>Senrigo,</HI> more Ea&s;tward by a hundred leagues, then the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Palmes</HI>; all the <HI>Blacks,</HI> as well of high as low <HI>Guinea,</HI> acknowledge this King, whereas the inhabitants along the Rivers, <HI>Faraca, Nigrate,</HI> and <HI>Budomel</HI> obey the King of <HI>Tombut,</HI> Lord of three kingdomes of <HI>Blacks.</HI></P>
<P>This countrey is called by the <HI>Protugue&s;e Mandimanca,</HI> where they adore the Moon, called by them the <HI>Bariamari,</HI> that is, the God of night or darkne&s;&s;e, and offer &s;acrifices to it in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure woods, in hollow trees, at midnight; as they do likewi&s;e at <HI>Ca&s;&s;anga,</HI> who have one <HI>China</HI> for their principal Idol, in who&s;e honour they goe on proce&s;&s;ion the twenty ninth of <HI>No|vember,</HI> about Midnight. One of their Prie&s;ts or Magicians with them called <HI>Acacani,</HI> bearing a banner of &s;ilk, with a faggot of Vine branches, and divers bones of dead men. I believe they are bones of &s;uch as have made voluntary &s;acrifice of them&s;elves to this <HI>Demon,</HI> who appeares to them after divers manners; this En&s;ign weares a garment of woven twigges, at which there hang divers heads of little dogs, Munkeys, and other &s;mall creatures. Proce&s;&s;ion ended, they repo&s;e the Idols with|in the &s;ame tree, and burne mo&s;t &s;weet perfumes to it, &s;a|crificing Mill; then make their prayers and depart.</P>
<P>In their dealings the&s;e people are lawle&s;&s;e, trading in &s;laves with the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and others, which they rapine from all parts, and make their Market of them, to a mi&s;erable &s;lavery. The <HI>Ca&s;&s;angarians</HI> neighbour upon another Nation called <HI>Leboura|mos,</HI> who live along the River Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> by the na|tives called <HI>Jarin,</HI> full of fi&s;h, but a dangerous Haven, for the Sands and Rocks which lye before it.</P>
<P>Towards the North is <HI>Guinalla,</HI> another River; in the mouth whereof, the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have built a Fort they call <HI>Sancta Cruz,</HI> and the Haven <HI>Guinalla.</HI></P>
<P>They are <HI>Negroes,</HI> which they term <HI>Beafares,</HI> abominable thieves, making prey of one another, to &s;ell to the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> The King of <HI>Guinalla</HI> keeps a great State, hath a numerous guard of Archers, be&s;ides fifty huge &s;trong dogges, all armed with
<PB N="324" REF="169">
&s;kin of &s;ea-oxe dre&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e, and made of proof, to every one a keeper. In Townes by night they have no other guards then &s;uch dogges, who once turned loo&s;e, &s;pare no man, &s;o as there is no &s;tirring out of dores, without dan|ger of being worried. This they do to defend them&s;elves from &s;uch as by night come to break their hou&s;es, which are onely turfe covered with leaves, to carry away <HI>Negroes</HI> for the Mar|ket. The King hath a mutiplicity of wives, and believes that &s;uch wives as dye with him for company, meet him in the other world, and become his wives again; but &s;ince they heard the true doctrine by &s;ome Fathers of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> who &s;hew'd them their folly, they have not been &s;o extravagant. Some of them were baptized, and went along with the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ide of <HI>Guinala</HI> comes out a branch which runnes to Port <HI>Begama,</HI> and a few leagues higher divides again in two, and upwards, delivers it &s;elf to the Sea. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> hold this Port, which they call <HI>Balola,</HI> and the people on this branch are called <HI>Lan&s;ados.</HI> Both the&s;e are good Havens joyntly inha|bited by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and the Natives. For from the Meri|dionall point of this River to <HI>Cape Vergas,</HI> there are three nations mingled with the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Malus, Ebagas,</HI> and <HI>Co|&s;olins.</HI></P>
<P>Now from the South of that <HI>Cape</HI> begins a fair well-peopled Pro|vince they call <HI>Gatulia,</HI> and the <HI>Portugue&s;e Serellionna,</HI> that is a point throwing it &s;elf into the &s;ea by the &s;ide of a great river of the &s;ame appellation, by rea&s;on of a hollow concavity roaring like a Lyon. This is a very plea&s;ant country, full of Groves of Bra&s;ill trees, and Vines which they have not knowledge to dre&s;&s;e, abundance of Midian Figges which they call <HI>Ban|canes,</HI> Sugar-canes grow without planting; Be&s;ides, they have good conveniences, as Mills and Engines to make their Sugar; for they have Mines in all parts. There is Rice, Cot|ton, Cattle innumerable, Fi&s;h, Pepper in abundance, and more keen and pure then other; but there is prohibition upon life to carry any to <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> for &s;poyling the &s;ale of that which comes from <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e there are Mines of Gold and Silver, Ivory, Am|ber-gris white and black; in brief, 'tis ab&s;olutely a land of promi&s;e and delights. This Pepper the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call <HI>Dimi|enta de cola,</HI> one would take it for a Che&s;tnut, it growes in a &s;hell, though without prickles. Other &s;trangers who come to traffick for it, lade with it, but the <HI>Spaniard</HI> dares not take a grain.</P>
<P>In this country there is variety, and abundance of Birds; a &s;ort of Ape they call a <HI>Baris,</HI> he is great and &s;trong, the inhabitants take them with nets, traps and other engines, entrapping the &s;ire and dam, with the young ones &s;et in cages. They u&s;e them but
<PB N="325" REF="169">
rudely, and beat them till they cry like children; make them walk upon two feet, tying the foremo&s;t in their pole to a &s;tick: be&s;ides make them do many offices, as fetch water in a pitcher, wa&s;h di&s;hes, blow the fire, draw wine, fetch meat from the But|cher, and any other dome&s;ticall charre: But among&s;t all they will &s;till be committing their petitlarcenies for meat and drink, but are well corrected for it. The &s;port is, when they turn the &s;pit, to &s;ee how he will &s;mell the meat, and turning his great &s;haggy head with hanging hair, flyly watch if any body &s;ee him, and they mu&s;t be very vigilant, or he &s;hews them a trick for the roa&s;t. As it happened to a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who had invited certain Merchants; but when they came to take up dinner, Mr. Jack-turn-&s;pit, had made u&s;e of one of the legs of a Turky-cock. His Ma&s;ter for the pre&s;ent beat him not, for the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e they had of him; who filled them wine and wa&s;hed their gla&s;&s;es, and &s;till at la&s;t took his cup when it came to his turn, and with his rogueries made them very merry.</P>
<P>To proceed, the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> make a good time with the&s;e <HI>Ne|groes,</HI> who bring them unrefined gold for things incon&s;iderable, and to facilitate their traffick upon a point of the Sea called <HI>Corco,</HI> five degrees North, they have built a Fort near a Town, inhabi|ted by the Natives and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> together. The whole Coun|trey of <HI>Serri Lionna</HI> is exceeding populous, and watered with fair Rivers, bounded with tall dates, and great orange trees. The fir&s;t River from <HI>Capo Verga,</HI> the Countreymen call <HI>Piterones,</HI> the Spaniards <HI>di Pietro,</HI> dividing into many branches, which inter|weave the land, and compo&s;e many I&s;lands, by the <HI>Negroes</HI> called <HI>Caga&s;ian</HI>; where at an ebbing tide they find Amber-gris: for which cau&s;e the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> built a good Town there, co-inhabi|ted by <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI>; where they live &s;o &s;trangely, 'tis hard to know a Chri&s;tian from a Pagan, nor is it ea&s;ie to judge who lives the better; there are at lea&s;t two thou&s;and, Chri&s;tians onely by name, living and dying like Pagans.</P>
<P>After this River there are two more, <HI>Capor</HI> and <HI>Tanaba&s;ira,</HI> de&s;|cending from a high Mountain, called <HI>Machamala,</HI> where &s;tands a great rock of Chry&s;tal, with divers Pyramids of the &s;ame, hanging from the top downwards; almo&s;t entirely in the air, two or three &s;pans di&s;tant from the ground, which &s;eems a great wonder, for touching it with the lea&s;t fillip, it &s;ounds like a bell. They &s;ay 'tis a congelation, made &s;o by the heat of the Sun, which melting the foot of the Rock, left the&s;e points hanging in the air. 'Tis for a truth that certain Magicians on a fea&s;t, carried their Idols thither, whither they ran from all &s;ides to the &s;acrifice, two thou|&s;and notwith&s;tanding lo&s;t their lives, and the Prie&s;ts in the fir&s;t place; for making their &s;acrifice and &s;uffumigation at the foot of the Chry&s;tall rock, the roof at which the&s;e Pyramids hung, &s;hook, &s;o as they broke and cru&s;hed to pieces the greater part of
<PB N="326" REF="170">
them. The Devil having not power to hinder the extraor|dinarie heate of the Sacrifices from di&s;&s;olving the con|gelations, &s;ince which time no one comes near this Chry&s;tall grotte.</P>
<P>Something farther North there are other great Rivers, which render this Province of <HI>Serrilyonna</HI> as a pack of I&s;lands&punc; particu|larly over again&s;t the mouth of one of them, there are two very plea&s;ant and good, the one called <HI>Toro,</HI> where are rocks called St. <HI>Anne,</HI> which bear pearl oy&s;ters, yet they go not to fi&s;h for them, by rea&s;on of Sea-mon&s;ters, which have &s;wallowed &s;ome who ventured.</P>
<P>In one degree to the South, lye the I&s;lands <HI>Dolos</HI> and <HI>Tan|&s;ente,</HI> inhabited with Dates, Sugar-canes, Citrons, and a|bundance of Cattell, covered with Rice, Millet, and long Pepper.</P>
<P>To conclude, the&s;e Blacks are governed by a King, and have Judges who admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to them, whom they call <HI>Foncos.</HI> At certain times the King in a various coloured robe, comes into a room hang'd with mat, &s;et round with &s;eats for Coun&s;ellours, whom they call <HI>Seitequi,</HI> and Advocates to plead for both parties. The Coun&s;ellors &s;peak their opinion, and the King gives &s;entence, which is immediately executed.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Guinalla</HI> dies, who governs many kingdoms, there go twelve <HI>Seitequi,</HI> in long gowns of divers colours, made of feathers, with twelve trumpetters before them, &s;ounding the more dolefully, by rea&s;on of a certain &s;kin they make u&s;e of, for rendering the note more &s;harp, and proclaim his death: where|upon every one comes out of his hou&s;e; mu&s;&s;led in a white cloath: while the allyes of the decea&s;ed a&s;&s;emble to elect another. They take the corps and wa&s;h it, burn the bowels before their Idol, and pre&s;erve the a&s;hes to be embalmed with his body. His Funerals are not celebrated till the next moon, when the people a&s;&s;emble from all parts of his dominion, bringing balm, incen&s;e, amber|gris, white and black, mu&s;k, and other aromaticks, to burn and perfume his body; which then &s;ix principall per&s;ons, in robes of white &s;ilke, bear to his Sepulcher, flutes and hoboyes &s;ounding mournfully, and attended with a concour&s;e of people cloathed in white cloth, &s;adly &s;inging and lamenting. The Princes who are in election are mounted on hor&s;es capari&s;oned with white, and them&s;elves cloathed with the like. The corps laid in the monu|ment well clo&s;ed and cimented, they return to the Palace to fea&s;t and make good cheer. On the morrow is the election of a new King, and as they &s;ay, 'tis made according to divine in&s;piration, without favour or affection. Then four <HI>Bacharin,</HI> or twelve <HI>Sei|tequi</HI> go to his hou&s;e, bind him and lay him upon a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> four carry him to the Palace, where the chief <HI>Bachir</HI> unbinds him, gives him three rude la&s;hes with a whip, he being on his knees

makes a &s;peech of remon&s;trance to him; then takes him by the beard or ear, and &s;ayes to him, If I deliver you this Scepter will you bring &s;uch a &s;hame upon me, as to be a Tyrant to your peo|ple? whereto he an&s;wers <HI>nec Bachir,</HI> that is, no my Lord. The other then &s;triking harder &s;ayes, do you promi&s;e this by the li|ving God, he an&s;wers <HI>Nec Bachis Ameleichina,</HI> which is, before the Almighty God, I promi&s;e it. Then they ve&s;t him in Royall robes, put a triple Scepter in his right hand, a lance in his left; then that per&s;on ca&s;ts him&s;elf at his feet, and craves his pardon; this done, he goes in triumph through the Town, where all re|joyce and bring him pre&s;ents.</P>

The <HI>Canaries,</HI> hereto|fore called the <HI>Fortunate,</HI> had that appellation from &s;ome terrible and &s;anguinary dogs which were there, going in packs like &s;heep, and at this day there is abundance of them exceeding fierce and dangerous. Of the&s;e I&s;lands there is the grand <HI>Canari, Tenerif, Palma, Gomora, du Fez, Fortaventura,</HI> and others le&s;&s;e, to about 28. degrees.</P>
<P>They afford divers curio&s;ities, among&s;t which Mount <HI>Pic</HI> in <HI>Tenerif</HI>; which I e&s;teem to be one of the highe&s;t on the earth, <HI>Libanus</HI> it &s;elf is not &s;o high by halfe, much le&s;&s;e Mount <HI>Gi|bel</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> for it may be di&s;covered at 120. miles di&s;tance, and is the fir&s;t land the Marriners di&s;cover at &s;ea, when they come from <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>This is not to be a&s;cended but two moneths in the year, <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> for the extreme colds, and becau&s;e 'tis commonly covered with &s;now, which cooles the ayre to &s;uch a degree, that one cannot breath upon it without iminent danger of life.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three re|gions of <HI>America.</HI></NOTE>Of the three Regions <HI>America</HI> may be divided into, there are the two outmo&s;t, the high and the low, and the interiour.

<P>They have cattle in great abundance, as &s;heep, goats, beeves, hor&s;es, and others. They pre&s;erve a &s;tock of wild beeves for their hides, wherewith they lade &s;hips for <HI>Europe</HI>; and make a good traffick of them to &s;upply our vanity for coaches boots, and other u&s;es of leather. The &s;oyle in &s;ome parts is proper enough for vines, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will admit no plantation of them, for taking away the profit of the wine brought from <HI>Spain,</HI> for which they carry back good gold and &s;ilver. But notwith&s;tanding their prohibitions in New-<HI>Spain,</HI> they have planted them for ea&s;e of their burthen&s;ome tributes; for they made no con&s;cience to impo&s;e fifty or &s;ixty crowns upon a tun of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> wine; which they get at a better rate upon the place, where they pro&s;per excellently well.</P>

<P>Part of them he took, and gave him a Coate of <HI>Azure</HI> Ta|feta, which he highly e&s;teemed and admir'd, and went confi|dently abord them with a &s;core of his men; and at &s;everall times came little boats loaded with fruit, which this Lord had provided to pre&s;ent the Captain with; at his departure he fired &s;ome Can|nons, which &s;trangely amazed the&s;e poor people, who thought the World at an end; they go cloath'd with skins, commodiou&s;ly &s;ew'd together.</P>
<P>In the Land of <HI>Labrador,</HI> and beyond Northward, are abundance of Mountains and Forre&s;ts, where there are numbers of wilde bea&s;ts, and among&s;t others huge beares, and great Griffins all white, which are nothing like tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t, or <HI>Africa,</HI> which are gray, only a little red under the belly, but both of them have but two feet, and not foure as they are pain|ted.

<P>A little higher lies the frozen &s;ea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fro|zen Sea.</NOTE> which &s;ome &s;ay is not a &s;ea frozen, but land covered with ice. An <HI>Indian,</HI> one <HI>Irica,</HI> told me that in his youth he had been in the Land of <HI>Labrador,</HI> which the Natives call <HI>&V;chacara,</HI> which borders on a Countrey called <HI>Al|fringa,</HI> and that cro&s;&s;ing from Province to Province, he &s;aw &s;eas of Va&s;t extent, all frozen, and the people a&s;&s;ur'd him twas not a Sea, but Land, covered with fre&s;h water-ice, a thing hard to be cre|dited.</P>
<P>They have not any Townes, but Villages, where on little hills they live in timber hou&s;es, covered with hides of Beifes, and o|ther bea&s;ts. The people are Whites, kinde and affable.

<P>They keep &s;tocks of tame Deer, which they drive to pa&s;ture as we do Cows and Oxen; from them they make excellent chee&s;e which mingled with a &s;ort of clouted cream, is a very delicate di&s;h.</P>

<P>They have di&s;covered a tree, called <HI>Aneda,</HI> or <HI>Zuaboya,</HI> much like our nut-tree, the decoction whereof is a &s;overaine, and pre|&s;ent remedy for a di&s;ea&s;e, common in this Country, which infects them like a plague, from head to foot, with a violent contraction of the &s;inews, &s;tinking breath, and mouth running with purtefica|tion, as at <HI>Scurbut,</HI> and at la&s;t &s;eizes on the vitall &s;pirits, and with extreme torments fini&s;hes their lives: but Providence hath furni&s;hed them with this remedy <HI>Aneda,</HI> as <HI>Carter</HI> in his Voyages ob&s;erves.</P>

<P>Some among&s;t them are of more humanity and a&s;&s;a&s;ibility, ad|dicting them&s;elves only to fi&s;hing, which they will willingly do for &s;trangers.</P>

<P>They bear great reverence to the Sun for the light and bene|fit they receive. They feed on bread made of fi&s;h, and the like as in <HI>Florida</HI>; live in common, and diver&s;e families under a roof. Men have &s;everal wives, whom they marry with little ceremo|ny, and leave them when they plea&s;e. Their King they call the great <HI>Sagamos</HI> or <HI>Sahagama,</HI> that is the great King, whom they carry upon a <HI>Sindela</HI> of cotton, mixt with feathers, very curious and artificiall: women wait at his table, nor will he tru&s;t men with any thing of his diet; as he pa&s;&s;es by, all bow with great re&s;pect, none is capable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion but the elde&s;t Son, all the other Children are &s;ubjects; for which cau&s;e the other wives, rather choo&s;e abortion, then to live to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>After the Kings decea&s;e; they live perpetual widows, and in &s;igne of mourning immediately put on the <HI>Singaye,</HI> make inci&s;ions in their face, then laying gum on a fire, hold over their faces that &s;moak may colour the &s;carifications, with this gum, and oyle of date-&s;tones, the meaner &s;ort make their face black and orange-tawny, their hair hangs loo&s;e about their &s;houlders, having nothing about their head but the <HI>Singaye,</HI> which they wear as the <HI>Moors</HI> do their hair, appearing both under and over it. This is made of feathers of a bird they call <HI>Tanaps:</HI> the <HI>Americans</HI> e&s;teem this bird ominous, when they meet it. The vulgar women wear other plumes with cotton, but they neither marry the &s;econd time.</P>
<P>The men wear apparel of Deer-&s;kins u&s;efully contrived, one arm uncovered, and &s;o they wear their garment like a &s;carf, their breeches like the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but not &s;o long. The Coun|trey is exceeding cold, and lyable to earth-quakes, for which they &s;acrifice to their Idols, whereof they have one in figure, half a man, and half a &s;erpent, which they call <HI>Andouagni,</HI> and adorn him in a rich habit, and their Country diamonds, which are not &s;o good as others.</P>
<P>They have mines, but none very good, fruits of many &s;orts, and among&s;t others a tree called <HI>Coltan,</HI> which yeilds an ex|cellent liquor that they make drink of, their King drinking nothing el&s;e. Vines grow there in abundance, naturally with|out labour, exceedingly loaded with grapes, but they have not the &s;kill to make wine of them, except they have been lately &s;hewed: they have pumpions and gourds which they eat roa&s;ted, oyle out of Date-&s;tones, very &s;weet and &s;overaign in di&s;ea&s;es. One tree there is which takes away any feaver in few hours. They are great hunters, and wear engines like raquets on their feet, whereby they go the lighter on the &s;now in pur&s;uit of their chace.

<P><HI>Goulmaran</HI> is the name of a river and a country, where the &s;a|vages chief food is fi&s;h, of which they have abundance, and drying it in the &s;un make flower, which they eat without other baking: they eat the fle&s;h of their enemies; they hou&s;e in caverns or cab|bins of &s;traw, without either apparel or hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe more then <HI>Gourds</HI> which the &s;oyle produces in abundance: great &s;tore of cattle which fatten them&s;elves without further care; they live in common, and admit no &s;trangers to inhabit among&s;t them. Their mortal enemies are the <HI>Siniga</HI> neighbouring Mountaneers, covered at halfes with bea&s;t &s;kins; and the&s;e nations as profe&s;&s;ed enemies, eat one another. For arms, they have &s;taves, bows, and &s;lings, wherein they are very effectual, being &s;trong and good wre&s;tlers. They lead into the field troops of fierce and &s;trong dogs, and fling them the head, hands, and feet of an enemy for re|ward; they only &s;pare their wives to whom they yield all honour, and marry with them. There is not among&s;t them any &s;ort of Science, Learning, or Character: they believe the &s;oul immortal, and that the Sun created the world, whom they call <HI>Courcourant</HI>&punc; and the Moon <HI>Beleida:</HI> live like brothers, without any Law of property, every man hath his wife, and with her is &s;atisfied; no di|&s;tinction of &s;in among&s;t them, vice nor vertue: all equal, onely a particular reverence to one chief as their King, whom they call <HI>Caraybalan:</HI> They &s;have their head and beard with a root called <HI>Meite,</HI> which dryed at the Sun, they make into powder, and ap|ply it plai&s;ter-wi&s;e all night. Maids deflowr'd before Matrimony, never marry, though the fact is no di&s;honour to them.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Singay</HI> by the advantage of their mountains, often fall upon them; they have a &s;ort of trunks through which they will blow their poy&s;oned arrowes with &s;trange vigour, and wound incurably. They are of admirable Footman&s;hip, and will fly like Grayhounds before a pur&s;uing enemy, and on &s;uch occa&s;ions their dogges &s;tand them in good &s;tead. They &s;catter about the fields certain poy&s;oned pa&s;te for the enemies dogges, and le&s;t their own &s;hould be taken with it, they hold them up tyed: he that hath two with him thinks him&s;elf &s;ecure.

<P>This is a country of wide circuit towards 34. degrees, having on the Ea&s;t the Channel of <HI>Bahama</HI> the <HI>Lucays</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> on the We&s;t <HI>Mexico</HI> and the gulph <HI>Panuco,</HI> on the South it looks upon <HI>Cuba</HI> or <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and on that &s;ide extends above 200. leagues to the 24. degree: on the North lyes <HI>Canada,</HI> New <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Auanares,</HI> towards this point or tongue of land, in form of an <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> 'tis dangerous &s;ayling for the oppo&s;ite winds and currents of water. The natives are &s;trong and turbu|lent, eat their enemies of war, but their friends and confederates never, not for any extremity. The men eradicate their beards to appear more lovely and plea&s;ing to the women: pierce their no&s;e and ears, and hang in rings and jewels: they marry not till 40 years of age, and the woman 25. holding that the children will be more robu&s;tious. Women before matrimony ob&s;erve not cha&s;tity, and without di&s;honour: but after marriage they will forfeit life as &s;oon as their fidelity.</P>
<P>North they border on the <HI>Aunares,</HI> and beyond them the <HI>Abar|daos,</HI> a cruell and wicked people, continually in warre, and u&s;e a thou&s;and &s;ubtleties to en&s;nare their enemies, but e&s;peci|ally by night, fir&s;t laying their Engines or Caltrops, then give the Alarme, and &s;eem to flye; &s;o the enemies pur&s;uing, are often taken in the&s;e trappes; as they likewi&s;e take wilde bea&s;ts: as they on the other &s;ide make conceal'd pits for them to fall in.</P>

<P>The <HI>Mexican</HI> Kings had high e&s;teem for men of valour, and rewarded them very amply, by which means they were &s;o well &s;erved in their wars, and got &s;o many victories.

<P>They pourtrayed the Sun and Moon, and by certain di&s;tincti|ons, knew the full and the qualities of it.

When a little needle in the middle of the wheel comes to point at the period of fifty years, then are they &s;troken with a &s;trong apprehen&s;ion, believing the world is to be ended, and for three or four dayes before lament, and make Sacrifices to appea&s;e the angry gods; but when it arrives at the point, they leave their Sacrifices, break all their u|ten&s;ils, as they were to die at the in&s;tant, lay them&s;elves on the ground with extream contu&s;ion for their bad lives, and terrour of approaching torments: and having &s;pent a day and night thus dolefully, upon appearance of the next day, which they never thought to &s;ee, they go &s;trait to vi&s;it the wheel, which now hath entered a new circulation; then repleat with joy they render a thou&s;and benedictions to the gods for the grace received, whereof they thought them&s;elves unworthy, with engagements of reformation for the future.

<P>After this their Prie&s;ts or <HI>Papaes,</HI> with 12. men and youths in feather garments, dancing &s;ilently to mu&s;ick, bear the Idol of their God <HI>&V;riacocha,</HI> followed with a number of boyes and girls in white, decked with flowers and feathers of various colours, then the Religious in their proper habits, next come 12. &s;heep for &s;a|crifice, then the principal per&s;ons with tapers in their hands, then follow the whole multitude of men and women, with hymns and gratifications, up to a Mountain: from whence they ob&s;ervantly return to the Temple.

<P>But before the Fea&s;t, they compound a meat of the fle&s;h of certain venemous Creatures, Mace, Tobacco, and certain roots, which the Prie&s;ts eating, a Devil enters their bodies, and they fall into a fury; then they begin their ball.

After four moneths &s;pace; the ponderous chains and chaldrons, with great co&s;t and paine were drawne up. The good man boa&s;ted, he doubted not now to come &s;hortly to his ends, and that he had a revelation of it in his &s;leep: at length all the&s;e iron Engines were &s;et in order, and the work-men to the number of 50. began to let down a Chaldron well fa&s;tened to a &s;trong chain of iron with other Engines &s;ecured, and the Prie&s;t him&s;elf &s;et his hand to the work: But as they thought to draw up the Chaldron full of rich melted mettle, the &s;trength of the fire con&s;umed all, and they hardly e&s;caped without burning their hands and feet, &s;o violent a heat bur&s;t out upon them. The Prie&s;t halfe mad cry'd out, the Devil had broken his chain with a thou|&s;and cur&s;es, ready to throw him&s;elf headlong into the Precipice, covered over with &s;oot and cindars, and frying with heat, fright, and toyle, that he looked like a right fury; running like a mad|man to and fro; the re&s;t in little better condition, the greate&s;t part being lam'd and con&s;um'd with labour, and the violence of heat which had even melted them. The good man at la&s;t was brought to his lodging in extreme torment, where they laid him to bed in &s;o much grief and di&s;comfort, that he was the pitty of the world. Waking in the night he was &s;urprized with &s;uch a rage, that he gave him&s;elf &s;everal &s;tabbes in the throat with his knife, and in the morning his &s;i&s;ter coming to vi&s;it him, found him &s;teep'd in blood and ga&s;tly, half dead, whereupon &s;he cryed out for help, and friends came immediately in, and a Chirurgion applyed the country bal&s;om &s;o fortunately to his wounds, that he was well within few dayes; neverthele&s;&s;e for extreme griefe and &s;ullen|ne&s;&s;e he could eat nothing, at la&s;t he langui&s;hed to death, having con&s;um'd all he had gotten, be&s;ides what his &s;i&s;ter had, and other friends whom he quite ruined.</P>

The <HI>Indians</HI> called him <HI>Malnixa,</HI> as a God de&s;cen|ded from heaven. Among&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves he had great enemies, as <HI>Garary, E&s;trada, Olid,</HI> and <HI>Navez,</HI> whom he routed, and compleated his conque&s;t. The Emperour made him Marque&s;&s;e <HI>del Valla.</HI> He was indued with all the qualities of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> vertuous and vitious. He was bold, valiant, &s;uddain in execution, clear &s;pirited, &s;ubtle, patient, and re&s;olute; but ambi|tious, out of mea&s;ure cruell, and libidinous. He dyed in <HI>Spain,</HI> at the age of 63. in the year 1546. He conquered in <HI>Mexica</HI> from 12. to 15. degrees. The town of <HI>Mexica</HI> is in 19. degrees: about the 8. of <HI>May,</HI> and the 16. of <HI>July</HI> the Sun is perpendicu|lar. The countrey is temperate, but rather hot then cold, clothes there not being tedious or trouble&s;ome, nor nakedne&s;&s;e impor|tune, or broyling.</P>
<P>The Mines are not &s;o wealthy as in <HI>Peru</HI>: but more profitable by rea&s;on of the le&s;&s;e charge and danger. Be&s;ides gold, &s;ilver, iron, and bra&s;&s;e; they bring from thence &s;ugar, cochenell, cotton, plumage, honey, wax, balm, amber, &s;alt, medicinable drugges, &amp;c. and few ve&s;&s;els return light, which is not in <HI>Peru, Spain</HI> being enriched as well from one as the other. For though there is &s;o much trea&s;ure to be exhau&s;ted, yet there is not &s;o much danger. The faith hath made a farther progre&s;&s;e, the countrey is better peopled, the natives better ordered, more regular, better Mar|kets

of cattle, hor&s;es, &s;ugars, and meat, wherein <HI>Peru</HI> cannot com|pare, which doubtle&s;&s;e would be better if it had more rain.</P>
<P>The natives wondring why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were inqui&s;itive of gold and &s;ilver, at fir&s;t they made them believe 'twas to cure them of a pain at their heart, whereto they were &s;ubject, but in time they found it did hold them there indeed.</P>
<P><HI>Cortez</HI> to bring the&s;e people in obedience to his King, told them he was Emperour of all the Chri&s;tians, the greate&s;t Lord on earth, who had under him more Kingdomes and Provinces then other Kings had &s;ubjects.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Spani&s;h</HI> vanity.</NOTE> That his government was founded on Ju&s;tice, and proceeded immediately from God, that he was ac|compli&s;hed with all vertues, and that the Monarchy of the whole Univer&s;e, was by right his inheritance, and other <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> boa&s;ts and vanities.</P>
<P>Concerning the particulars of this great country, be&s;ides what I have &s;aid already. In the Province of <HI>Mechoacan,</HI> there is an ex|cellent root of the &s;ame name with the countrey, by others called <HI>Jeheurais,</HI> of the &s;ame vertue to purge, as <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> but more light and white, and purges with le&s;&s;e violence, which is a great traffick in <HI>Spain,</HI> where 'tis worth three or four realls the pound, and there almo&s;t nothing. 'Tis taken by the weight of a Crown pulveriz'd in an egge, wine, or broth. I have &s;een greater effects of it then <HI>Rhubarb.</HI> It may be kept four or five years or longer with care, but there is &s;uch abundance, they matter it not.</P>
<P>By information of the natives, &s;ome of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were cu|red of di&s;ea&s;es by this root, and &s;o it became famous. 'Tis called <HI>Indian Rhubarb.</HI> Among&s;t other trees in <HI>Mexico</HI> or the land of <HI>Caperous,</HI> there is the famous tree of <HI>Muguey,</HI> whereof they tell as many wonders, and &s;everal u&s;es, as of the Ea&s;tern <HI>Cocos,</HI> for it yields water, wine, vinegar, oyle, honey, wax, thread, and needles;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A tree yielding all nece&s;|&s;aries.</NOTE> &s;o as this is &s;ufficient to keep a man. After drawing fre&s;h water, the fruit will be like &s;weet &s;mall nuts. The water a little boyled becomes good wine; more boyled, like burnt wine, which coagulate again excellent honey, whereof they make Sy|rupes: The fir&s;t water &s;et in the Sun makes good vinegar: From the leaves i&s;&s;ues &s;weet milk, and out of the leaves you may draw thread, &s;trong enough to make cloth. I brought with me two &s;hirts of it, and &s;ome of the fruit, as perfect into Europe, as it grew on the tree, for the rind is very thick, and that pre&s;erves it. cloth made of this yarne, will ever have &s;ome dark gray &s;treaks in it. About the leaves grow little prickles, &s;o &s;trong and hard, they u&s;e them for needles, and &s;ew with no other. There are many who live on this tree alone, which puts forth leaves upon leaves continually, and in &s;uch abundance, that the tree is covered over from the root to the top, which makes it un&s;hapely. To make it pregnant, they lay cindars to the root: the wood is of &s;uch qua|lity, it endures twice as long in the fire as any other, and when
<PB N="369" REF="191">
they will keep fire a long time, they u&s;e a piece of this wood.</P>
<P>Balm comes from a tree &s;omething like a Pomegranate tree, and it produces &s;everal &s;orts of &s;everal vertues. The fir&s;t is <HI>Opo|bal&s;amo,</HI> excellent for wounds and the plague, of gold co|lour like Ambar: another &s;ort is &s;omething white: another &s;ort is pre&s;s'd out the leaves and &s;prigges burnt; of &s;uch vertue, 'twill draw any iron out of the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>I brought &s;ome into <HI>France,</HI> wherewith I did mo&s;t admi|rable cures of wounds, and old ulcers which had eaten to the very bone.</P>
<P>In a word, 'tis mo&s;t &s;overaigne for wounds, paines in the &s;ides, contagions, and holding a little in the mouth, pre|&s;erves from bad ayrs.</P>
<P>They much e&s;teeme another tree called <HI>Cacao,</HI> as the fruit is of great u&s;e and traffick, which pa&s;&s;es with them as money to buy all commodities. The fruit is like an Al|mond, a little le&s;&s;e: They are never without <HI>Cacoas</HI> in their pockets, to buy what they want, for alms, or to eat;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit u&s;ed for mony.</NOTE> and 'twill keep a long time. The Province of <HI>Guatima</HI> produces them in abundance, where they make a precious drink of it, that ac|cordingly mixt cools, or heats: it makes good wine. They make Cakes of it good for the &s;tomack, and pti&s;ick, 'tis like an Almond tree, the leaves a little broader, and of a thicker body. To make it pro&s;per, they plant another by the &s;ide of it: 'tis very tender, and &s;uffers equally by cold and heat.</P>
<P>This latter tree they call <HI>Cacaos</HI> mother, becau&s;e it pre&s;erves it from the injuries of the weather. Who&s;oever hath this tree, they e&s;teem him happy and pious, in opinion, if he were not &s;uch, their God would not have &s;ent him this tree: and when &s;uch a tree dyes, they believe the Ma&s;ter hath committed &s;ome hei|nous crime.</P>
<P>In like manner they have their <HI>Coca</HI> in high e&s;teem at <HI>Peru,</HI> which being chewed and held in the mouth, marvellou&s;ly re|vives the &s;pirit. 'Tis of very delicate ta&s;te, whereof they make great traffick to <HI>Poto&s;&s;i.</HI></P>

This Countrey is long and narrow, compo&s;ed of plains, mountains, and valleys: The plains are by the Sea-coa&s;t; on the other &s;ide the Mountains are rea&s;onable good, but &s;ome hungry enough. The plain may be of thirty or fourty miles broad, from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, and holds the length from North to South. And 'tis &s;trange that in &s;ome parts they never have any rain, and in others more than they wi&s;h for, being but fourty or fifty Leagues di|&s;tant.</P>
<P>In the plains then it never rains, all they ever have is a dew, which is &s;o &s;lender it never wets at all. Their hou&s;es are covered

<P>The vales of <HI>Charcas</HI> yield good ground, and the Mountains are rich in Mines. The rea&s;on they have no rain in &s;ome parts, is want of matter for exhalation, there being nothing but &s;and, and neither Rivers nor Fountains.

Where the Mountains are not &s;o very high, there they have &s;ometimes rains, as at <HI>Arica, Arequipa,</HI> and &s;ome other places.

<P>In <HI>May,</HI> when we fir&s;t begin to feel heats in <HI>Europe,</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI> they are extream cold, where the <HI>Toumacaui</HI> reigns, as at <HI>Poto&s;&s;i</HI> and through all the Countrey of <HI>Charca,</HI> as 'twere the heart of <HI>Peru</HI>; a wind more cold and piercing than any in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and at <HI>Poto&s;&s;i</HI> is indurable, though the Mountain be higher than <HI>No&s;tre Dame de la garde,</HI> at <HI>Mar&s;eills,</HI> or Mount <HI>Martre</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI>: there is a le&s;&s;e Mountain at the &s;ide of it, called <HI>Guayna Poto&s;&s;i,</HI> or young <HI>Poto&s;&s;i,</HI> both of a colour, red without any verdure.

<P>One of the wonders of <HI>Peru,</HI> nay of the whole earth, is the Mountain <HI>Perlaca,</HI> where the air is &s;o cold, thin, and piercing, that it cau&s;es pa&s;&s;engers to vomit, to that extremity they bring up bloud and kils them with intolerable gripings: and if the travailers make not all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed 'tis no &s;caping: for in this &s;hort pa&s;&s;age of four or five dangerous leagues, men loo&s;e their &s;en&s;es, and often their hor&s;es or what they ride on will &s;tand immoveable, without &s;en&s;e either of &s;pur or whip, &s;o as they are con&s;trained to run on foot, and drive their bea&s;ts before them.</P>
<P>Some cover their eyes, others &s;top their ears, and their no&s;e, o|thers muffle and lap their head and whole body. Others put their head in a bag of herbs, and aromatick drugs, others carry cordials to eat, others eat not of all day, that they may not have &s;o much matter to vomit; but oftentimes this &s;erves not the turn, when one is in this pernicious place, where there is nothing to be heard but laments and vomitings, and notwith&s;tanding that the Sun &s;hine never &s;o clear, this vapour hath &s;till its force: &s;ome go other wayes a &s;ide off, but they &s;till find the &s;ame inconvenience, and the danger &s;ometimes more great: all the wayes are exceed|ing bad, and the wor&s;t by the Sea &s;ide.</P>
<P>The whole extent of this quarter is not above five and twenty leagues, without people, bea&s;ts, trees, or gra&s;&s;e, &s;o de&s;ert is the place, and beyond the Countrey extends 500. leagues: At the foot of the&s;e Mountains there are &s;ome ra&s;cally Innes, they call <HI>Tambos,</HI> where one finds but wretched entertainment. This is the high-road from <HI>Peru</HI> to <HI>Chila</HI>: At the foot of the Mountain to|wards the Sea, one would think the pa&s;&s;age more benign, but there reigns a wind chiefly in <HI>May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which cools and penetrates with extremity, &s;o as fingers and toes freeze and fall off with cold, the greate&s;t part peri&s;h in pa&s;&s;ing, and the wind renders them incorruptible.</P>
<P>Of burning mountains we have &s;poken &s;ufficiently in <HI>Mexico,</HI> &s;ome there are in <HI>Peru</HI> towards <HI>Arequipa,</HI> which throw forth &s;tones; others onely &s;moak, others flaming pumice &s;tones, &s;ome vomiting flames and cinders, others &s;calding winds.</P>

Near <HI>Guatimala</HI> in 1586. for &s;ix moneths this hill ca&s;ts out flames and cinders, followed with earthquakes, that they have thought the Countrey had been ruined. All <HI>Mexico</HI>

<P>Mo&s;t parts of this <HI>India</HI> are &s;ubject to the&s;e furnaces, and earth-quakes, and chiefly near the Sea.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of certain Fountains, Lakes, Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in this Countrey.</HEAD>
<P>NEar <HI>Poto&s;&s;i</HI> at the bottom of the vale <HI>Tarapaye,</HI> there lyes a Lake, round as 'twere drawn with a compa&s;&s;e, and the water &s;o hot, that but at the brims there is no enduring it, but thirty paces forward 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, notwith&s;tanding the Countrey round about is exce&s;&s;ive cold. In the middle it boyles and runs round, that you would think &s;ome tem|pe&s;t were underneath. From this Lake they draw a Channell that &s;ets certain Leather-Engines at worke, u&s;efull for the Mines, without any wa&s;te of the water. <HI>Titicaca</HI> in <HI>Collao</HI> is famous for largene&s;&s;e, and bearing ve&s;&s;els of burthen: fi&s;h a|bounds in it, whereof the Inhabitants round about take great quantity, very &s;weet, good, and commodious for pa&s;&s;engers, to whom they freely give part of their fi&s;h, taking them with certain hand Engines. If a Prie&s;t come that way they will pre&s;ent him a thou&s;and civilities, and he is happy with whom he will lodge. One is in perfect &s;ecurity among&s;t them, not under&s;tanding what theft meanes, and you may tru&s;t them with all the trea&s;ure of the world, while you live like good Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Throughout the Countrey there are abundance of other Lakes, as that of <HI>Eupama</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> whence &s;o many Rivers i&s;&s;ue; and among&s;t others the great <HI>Paraguay,</HI> or <HI>Plata,</HI> which make inundations like <HI>Nile,</HI> but not &s;o moderately, for <HI>Nile</HI> comes without any injury, but on the contrary with all commo|dity: whereas <HI>Plata</HI> breaks with fury into the Countrey for three months together, cour&s;ing from the <HI>Cordilleras</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI> to the South Sea. They have a way to pa&s;&s;e rivers upon floats of gourds or pumpions fa&s;tened together, which they u&s;e for all &s;ort of car|riage, in &s;ome places they have bridges of &s;traw. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have built &s;tone bridges, which the <HI>Indians</HI> much admire, and at fir&s;t had no confidence to tru&s;t them&s;elves upon bridges in the air.</P>
<P>Now for their Fountains, near the cape St. <HI>Helen</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> there is a Fountain of liquor burns like oyl: 'tis a certain Bitumen, or Gum, which they call <HI>Copey,</HI> or <HI>Copal,</HI> that never decrea&s;es, how much &s;oever is taken out. Marriners u&s;e to liquor their cordage with it. The like is in the I&s;le of <HI>Lobos,</HI> in <HI>Mexico,</HI> which the Marriners can &s;mell three miles at Sea, and more, if the wind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it right.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> there are Fountaines, the water whereof immediately
<PB N="378" REF="196">
congeals into white &s;alt, in which <HI>Peru</HI> abounds. In <HI>Guan|caue&s;ica</HI> there are hot &s;prings that conden&s;e to &s;tone, whereof they build their hou&s;es; but the water drunk is mortall: wherefore they &s;top up all high-wayes to it, for it cau&s;es a pre&s;ent heavine&s;&s;e, and then they die immediately. They have many other fountains hot and cold clo&s;e together, &s;ome where|of cure the French di&s;ea&s;e, though never &s;o confirmed, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Sa&s;&s;aparilla</HI> that grows in them.</P>
<P>In <HI>Peru</HI> there is a &s;heam red as bloud, for that called <HI>Rio Vermeio.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Caramel</HI> they have another Fountain cures all feavers, and purges like Rhubarb; the water is bracki&s;h and &s;alt at the fir&s;t ta&s;te, but afterwards one feels nothing, but may drink his fill without dammage: it drives through the body all that is ma|lignant, then pa&s;&s;es clear. I thought I &s;hould have vomited my bowels up, but afterwards I found my &s;elf &s;ound and cheerfull, and cured of a Rhume in my teeth I had been troubled with for a long time. I drunk three flagons a day, and &s;till it provoked me to drink more: They come to it from all parts, and for all di&s;ea&s;es, even for wounds. And the place is made &s;o nece&s;&s;ary one may bath in it. 'Tis onely hurtfull to hot livers.</P>
<P>Round about it are tents of &s;traw, and beds of cotton, and &s;heep-&s;kins, where you &s;hall have all accomodation for a &s;mall matter, and they will officiou&s;ly fetch and furni&s;h you with any thing you want, among&s;t others they bring us a fowle called <HI>Magnota,</HI> more delicate than a patridge, ano|ther that is white and black, and eats like a capon, and a|bundance of turtles. But of Lakes, where is there any &s;o admirable as that whereon the Towne of <HI>Mexica</HI> is &s;eated? whereof one part by rea&s;on of Salt-peter at the bottome is &s;alt as the Sea, the other by rea&s;on of the Rivers that fall into it fre&s;h as any Fountaine, each divi&s;ion being ten leagues in length, and five in breadth, and three dayes journey in circuite, with a delightfull Mountain in the middle, and a bath hot as that at <HI>Baleru.</HI> In the middle of the Lake is the Charnell of green Tombs, ever covered with herbs and flowers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have laid mo&s;t of the Town dry, being before in the manner of <HI>Venice,</HI> and have made conduits that convey water throughout the Towne, and chiefly round the walls. Out of avarice the new Conquerours admit not the <HI>Indians</HI> to fi&s;h on the Lake without licen&s;e, who now, contrary to Articles, enjoy not their ancient liberties, neither in this nor other things.</P>

<P>AMong&s;t other rarities and riches, the New World produces Mines of Gold and Silver, pearles and precious &s;tones in di|vers places, and chiefly in new <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> which of all parts of the world, are mo&s;t indulged with the&s;e advantages of na|ture, though other parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> have them in &s;ome abundance, and <HI>Europe</HI> likewi&s;e: but it appeares <HI>America</HI> had the principal and better portion, as well in the&s;e as other Dowries, as I have before mentioned.</P>

<P>At the gold and &s;ilver mines they coyne not, for want of Arti&s;ts, but they cut pieces and gobbits, whereon they mark the price from one reall to eight, and &s;o &s;end them to <HI>Spain.</HI> The Mines belong to Merchants, who give &s;o much to the King, &s;ome four, &s;ome five <HI>per centum.</HI> For want of men that can and will work, they get the mettle with much difficulty, being the toyle wherein the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have &s;pent the lives of &s;o many thou&s;ands, nay mil|lions of mi&s;erable Indians.</P>
<P>The Mines are exceeding deep, where the workmen are much inconvenienced with water, and with damps that poy&s;on them: few free-men will venture them&s;elves, and the meane&s;t &s;lave hath his three crownes a day, who are often buried under the falls of the Mine, &s;o as by this means by degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mines of gold and &s;ilver.</NOTE> the generation of the Indi|ans will be in &s;hort time totally con&s;umed, who are con&s;trained to undergo the work to get their livelyhood, how good Chri&s;tians &s;oever they are; and to &s;peak uprightly, looking on the in&s;atia|ble avarice of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the mi&s;ery the&s;e Mines put them to, 'tis hard to judge who is the better, the &s;laves or the natives; for the &s;laves, for 800. or 1000. crowns may redeem them&s;elves again; the extreme colds they meet with at the bottom, often &s;trikes them dead, having little or no wine to relieve them: being a barren country, and the lea&s;t gla&s;&s;e of wine at the price of a Re|all, the &s;malle&s;t money they have among&s;t them, where they u&s;e not to &s;tamp any Demy-Realls: if a man will live but with mode|ration, his wine will &s;tand him in a crown a day, which cuts their gaines the &s;horter: they pay dear for apparell, and principally for &s;hooes, which rot with continually &s;tanding in water: They have the better of it, that work at the mouth of the Mine, for they hand the materials from one to another, and &s;o have the be|nefit to &s;ee the day light, whereas they below &s;ee not but by can|dle-light: the depth is &s;ometimes a thou&s;and, or two thou&s;and &s;teps, which are fac'd with boards, or leather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of their working in the Mine.</NOTE> or 'twere impo&s;&s;ible to endure it: But again, 'tis much more inconvenient to one that is not u&s;ed to it, by rea&s;on of the ayre, that makes one vomit in ex|tremity, as I experienced going in one day, though I had travai|led all the &s;eas in the Univer&s;e, without the lea&s;t motion.

<P>In the <HI>Veta</HI> or vein of &s;ilver there are 78. Mines belonging to &s;everal Ma&s;ters, except &s;ome one hath rented &s;everal, the tin Mine hath 24. Ma&s;ters, every one his particular Mine, they go le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e, according to the quality of the mettle, as that of bra&s;&s;e is le&s;&s;e, iron le&s;&s;e then that. There is a gate, and goods locks to every Mine, they work by turnes, otherwi&s;e they could never endure it, the ayre is &s;o &s;trong and pernicious.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver Mine may be 150. ells deep, toyl&s;ome to the labou|rers, e&s;pecially the &s;laves, who&s;e backs are loaded with &s;ilver, and their legges with iron. When a Mine yields five for a hundred, 'tis &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Great art is required to direct the Mine, &s;ometimes they can neither find men nor Mine, being all for want of good direction, overwhelmed: wherefore Geometry is very nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Silver generally lyes betwixt two rocks or mountains, the one very &s;oft, the other as hard, and ever in the very middle.

I took all to be the &s;ame, perceiving nothing of &s;ilver in any &s;tone, but the workmen know it perfectly. The oare they carry to little furnaces to be fin'd. When the &s;tone is good, a hundred weight yields fifty pieces of eight, &s;ome not above thirty, nay five; but the riche&s;t of all, two hundred and above. There is not a Mine but hath belonging to it at lea&s;t four thou&s;and of the&s;e little furnaces, &s;ome five or &s;ix thou&s;and, as that at <HI>Caratecas</HI> and <HI>Poto&s;&s;i.</HI> You would think you &s;aw an Army of the bellows-blowers.</P>

<P>They bring to <HI>Spain</HI> every year 12. or 13. millions more or le&s;&s;e, whereof the fifth comes to the King, the re&s;t to the Ma&s;ters. There was one in few years got two hundred thou&s;and crownes and more for his &s;hare; and when he dyed, had not a &s;heet to bury

<P><HI>PEru</HI> was fir&s;t di&s;covered by <HI>Va&s;co Munes de Balbon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peru</HI> by whom di&s;|covered.</NOTE> in the year 1515. and the fir&s;t Haven knowne, was <HI>Porto Vieio</HI> under the Equinoctial. The Dominions of <HI>Peru</HI> under the <HI>Incas</HI> reached from <HI>Quito</HI> to <HI>Charcas</HI> 700. leagues, then to <HI>Chila</HI> 500. leagues. By tradition 'tis about 500. yeares &s;ince the Natives of <HI>Peru</HI> living barbarou&s;ly, without civility, law, or policy; &s;ome among&s;t them e&s;teemed, de&s;cended from heaven, and a generation of the Sun, civilized the re&s;t, and modelized the government.

<P>The&s;e Kings, or <HI>Incas,</HI> enacted good lawes, and by de|grees extended the Empire to the &s;tate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found

<P>Notwith&s;tanding 'tis to be admired, that in &s;uch darkne&s;&s;e and ignorance of all moral and and natural &s;ciences, their <HI>Amantas</HI> or <HI>Sages,</HI> &s;hould have a &s;ort of knowledge of the cour&s;es of the Sun, and Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calander</HI> of <HI>Peru.</HI></NOTE> and other &s;tars, for they knew in &s;ome kinde the an|nual motion of he Sun, and the vulgar counted their yeares by the harve&s;ts. They likewi&s;e under&s;tood the Sol&s;tices, ob&s;er|ving them of eight days in the Ea&s;t at <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> and another number in the We&s;t: they reckoned the moneths by Moons, allowing twelve in the year, adding though gro&s;&s;ely, the eleven dayes over-plus, at the points of <HI>Sol&s;tice</HI>; ob&s;erved the Equinoctials, whence in <HI>September</HI> they made the principal fea&s;t of the Sun.</P>
<P>The Equinoctial they found by the &s;hadow of a pillar, and the Eclip&s;es in like manner, during which time, they think the Sun angry with them, and the moon &s;ick. The king took the Rainbow for his Arms and device. They kept all accounts by knots upon &s;trings of various colours: and they had &s;ome harmony of Mu&s;ick in &s;ongs and In&s;truments of Canes fa&s;ten|ed together, four and four, in the nature of Organs, whereon they could expre&s;&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions of love, content, or &s;orrow. They had al&s;o &s;ome Poetry and ver&s;e, in mea&s;ure with Meetre, and called their Poets <HI>Harauee,</HI> that is, Inventors.</P>
<P>Their Temples were of &s;tone magnificently built, &s;umptuous for gold and &s;ilver. The &s;tatue of the Sun was ma&s;&s;y gold, which a <HI>Spaniard</HI> took and gam'd away in a night, whereupon one &s;aid by way of je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, that he had plaid away the Sun before he was up.

<P>In their golden garden were all &s;orts of hearbs and plants, trees, flowers, fruits, animals of ma&s;&s;y gold, and &s;ilver to the life; In &s;hort, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> found there un&s;peakable wealth, yet all was nothing in compari&s;on of that the Natives concealed, or ca&s;t into the Sea or Lakes, which could never be recovered.

<PB N="389" REF="201">
foretold the arrival of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> an unknown people, who &s;hould take away their E&s;tates and Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Tapangui</HI> the tenth King, atchieved great conque&s;ts, and extended his Empire to <HI>Chi&s;a,</HI> above 1000. leagues, and built the fortification of <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> that &s;eems rather rocks grafted toge|ther by enchantment, than an edifice built by indu&s;try and &s;trength of men; for the va&s;tne&s;&s;e of the &s;tones of 38. foot long, and 18. broad, when they had u&s;e neither of Iron, Waggons, Oxen, Cranes nor Pullies, but fetched all from remote parts by humane &s;trength.</P>
<P>The 12. <HI>Inca Huaina Capat,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called <HI>Guainae|cauan,</HI> that made the famous roads, with the monumentall &s;tones and Innes from <HI>Quito</HI> to <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> for above 500. leagues, the one by the Mountains, the other along the Sea &s;hore upon the plain, works far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the <HI>Romans</HI> boa&s;t of, for length, art, la|bour, and co&s;t; be&s;ides the rich and prodigious chain of gold, eve|ry link wri&s;t thick, made for a &s;ort of dance never found by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>This King was capable of the true Religion, for he would rea|&s;on that the Sun could not be the Soveraign God, but that there mu&s;t be one more powerful that commanded his perpetual circu|lation; becau&s;e were the Sun his own ma&s;ter he would &s;ometimes re&s;t for his plea&s;ure, not for nece&s;&s;ity; whereas the Soveraign God ought to enjoy the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity without pertur|bation, which was not &s;een in the Sun.</P>
<P>King <HI>Huiana</HI> now in peace at his palace of <HI>Tamipampa,</HI> in 1515. had intelligence of certain &s;trangers, not altogether unknown, that coa&s;ted the &s;hore of his Dominions: Fir&s;t <HI>Nunez Balboa</HI> di&s;covered it in 1513. afterwards <HI>Pizarra</HI> and his Company, who fir&s;t gained it in 1531.</P>
<P>The news much di&s;turbed the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;age of the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> arri|vall.</NOTE> calling to mind an ancient oracle among&s;t them, how a forraign bearded people &s;hould con|quer and de&s;troy their Empire: be&s;ides in 1512. they had divers pre&s;ages that portended the &s;ame.

<P><HI>Huiana</HI> had by all his wives above 300. children, yet but one legitimate, called <HI>Hila&s;car,</HI> by his wife who was his Si&s;ter, and one other by his dear Concubine, called <HI>Acabalipa</HI>; to whom he left the kingdom of <HI>Quito,</HI> and <HI>Hua&s;cat</HI> reigned &s;overaign at <HI>Cu&s;co</HI>: But <HI>Acabalipa</HI> to throw off his homage to his Brother, in|vaded him with a bloudy war, defeated him, and took him, and put to death all the <HI>Incas,</HI> and Princes of the blood-Royal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty revenged.</NOTE> that he might reign &s;ole King, though according to the Sanctions of
<PB N="390" REF="202">
the State not capable, his Mother being Daughter neither of <HI>Coya,</HI> that is, a Queen, nor of <HI>Palla,</HI> a Prince&s;s of the blood. He gave death to above two hundred of his Brothers, then to as many of his alliance as he could lay hands on: as well men as women, with cruell torments; and extended his tyranny upon the very &s;ervants, and officers royal, with fire, violations, and other vil|lanies.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Canares</HI> alone, he put to death &s;ixty thou&s;and men, becau&s;e they had held with his Brother, and covered the land with carca&s;es, and horrible de&s;olations. In recompen&s;e this villain was ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> more wicked than him&s;elf, and they afterwards by them&s;elves not finding any that could exceed them again in villany.</P>
<P>In the year 1526. <HI>Franci&s;co Pizarra,</HI> and <HI>Diego Almagro,</HI> being at <HI>Panarma,</HI> having lived a long time in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the conque&s;t of <HI>&V;raba Cartagena,</HI> and other places, re&s;olved up|on the expedition and di&s;covery of <HI>Peru,</HI> where they met with ill-favoured entertainments at their fir&s;t landing. Then <HI>Pizarra</HI> going to <HI>Spain</HI> obtained the chief command in the de&s;igned con|que&s;t; and with four of his Brothers, <HI>Diego, Almagro,</HI> and others, made their inva&s;ion in the year 1531. with mo&s;t fortunate &s;ucce&s;s: <HI>Acabalipa</HI> they took, who paid a ran&s;om of gold and &s;ilver, never|thele&s;&s;e they gave him an ignominious death by the hands of the Hangman.</P>
<P>Thus was this mighty and opulent Empire conquered by a handfull of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> divine providence in in&s;crutible councels, making the avarice, cruelty, and other vices of the&s;e Victors in&s;trumentall, to bring the&s;e people to the knowledge of the true God.</P>
<P>Now is the time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> glut their avarice, and cruelty, perpetrate all in&s;olencies and truculencies imaginable, which have been &s;o fully repre&s;ented, ob&s;erved, and exaggerated by their own hi&s;tories and Authours, I &s;hall not need to paint them in any other colours: but they all or the greate&s;t part paid dear for it, when by inte&s;tine di&s;cord, envy, and amutinies among&s;t them|&s;elves, they butchered one another, and &s;o revenged the nefarious treatment of the poor <HI>Indians</HI>; and tho&s;e who over&s;tood this &s;elf-de&s;truction were ju&s;tly executed by the command of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, who commi&s;&s;ioned certain Licenciados <HI>Vacca de Ga&s;tro,</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;ca,</HI> to pronounce &s;evere ju&s;tice upon the&s;e &s;editious Mutineers: there the <HI>Pizarras, Almagros,</HI> and others, all peri|&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fifth Viceroy e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Peru,</HI> was <HI>Bla&s;ius Nuez,</HI> 1544. <HI>Lima,</HI> or the Town of Kings, was founded at this time, fir&s;t by <HI>Pizarra,</HI> in 1533. afterwards the re&s;idence of the Viceroys, the &s;eat of Parliament, Inqui&s;ition, Univer&s;ity, and the Metropolitan Church of the whole Countrey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the &s;treight of <HI>Magellan.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;trait of <HI>Magel|lan.</HI></NOTE>FRom <HI>Chila</HI> the next is the &s;treight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> of about 100. leagues in length, and not much more in breadth, or any waies, which is not to be &s;urvey'd till you are well within the land: The tides are &s;trong and dangerous, principally from the South &s;ea, by rea&s;on of the narrow entrance in the mouth, and a multitude of rocks and mountains before the mouth of it, which render the pa&s;&s;age hard to find, and being but a little out at &s;ea one can perceive nothing of it, &s;o as you mu&s;t go ca&s;t about with the cock-boat, though otherwi&s;e you know the way and the true heighth, which is about 52. degrees. There is one very high Mountain hard upon the mouth, called <HI>la campana,</HI> being in form like a bell. The &s;hallowe&s;t place is fifteen or twenty fathoms, and a very good bottom.</P>
<P>The South &s;ea enters thirty leagues within, among&s;t very high Mountains covered with &s;now, the North &s;ea enters it &s;eventy leagues on the other &s;ide, where they find bottoms in many pla|ces, as on the contrary, on the South &s;ide the depth is &s;uch no &s;hip can ride at anchor. On the North &s;ide there are expatiate plains and champians upon the firm land, and divers Rivers that fall into this &s;treight, &s;haded with odoriferous trees, which &s;hews the goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;oyle. It containes &s;ome I&s;lands not to be ventured on without di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants on the South &s;ide are exceeding little, on the North of Gyants &s;tature, whom in <HI>Magellan</HI> they call <HI>Paragous,</HI> for their great feet:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paragows.</NOTE> they clothe with &s;kins of &s;heep and other bea&s;ts for the rigidne&s;&s;e of the Climate. The&s;e are a people without civility,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chica</HI> a Countrey.</NOTE> law, or policy, wandring up and down without any certain abode, repo&s;ing in Cabins, and no other arms than bow and arrows; when we &s;peak to them and they under&s;tand not the language, they lift their eyes to heaven. They live upon fle&s;h dried in the Sun, enemies to none, but give them&s;elves wholly to cha&s;e and fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>This Streight is vexed with forcible tides from both &s;ides, which like two Cells encounter with a mo&s;t ob&s;treperous fragour, where the danger is great, and chiefly in winter, when the winds rage there with more violence: for the Streight is never free from winds, no not in &s;ummer: divers ve&s;&s;els peri&s;h in cro&s;&s;ing the Rocks, which &s;eem an Archipelagus of I&s;lands, both tho&s;e on the South-&s;ea-&s;ide, and tho&s;e which come from <HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P>The immen&s;e depth on the South &s;ide renders the &s;ea more navigable, and on the North the length of the fall breaks the
<PB N="393" REF="203">
force of the waves, &s;o as there is no great danger but in the nar|rowe&s;t, and in &s;ome places of not above a mu&s;ket &s;hot.</P>
<P>In the winter the Sea is higher than in Summer, and the pa&s;&s;age wider, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ailing is nothing more &s;ecure by rea&s;on of the cro&s;&s;e winds and colds. Some are of opinion that the Tides do not meet at the &s;ame time, but as it flowes on one &s;ide it ebbs on the other, by a locall remotion of the &s;ea: but they are deceived, for 'tis certain that the floud comes in and goes out on both &s;ides at the &s;ame time, like as the boyling of a pot ri&s;ing from the center di&s;per&s;es to all parts, and cooling, cea&s;es all together: this hath been proved by ex|perience, that at the &s;ame time the floud came thirty leagues form the South, and &s;eventy from the North, the Sea &s;welling from both parts, as the Pilots ob&s;erved, following the cour&s;e of the Moon, the Tides augmenting or dimini&s;hing according to her &s;tate, the Tide and Ebbe coming &s;ooner or later by three quarters of an hour daily conformable to the cour&s;e of that plannet: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call the high-tide at the new-moon <HI>Ca|beza de aguas,</HI> the tide at the full <HI>Aguas viuas,</HI> the low tides in the wane, <HI>Aguas muertas.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;o admirable motion of the Sea &s;eems rather a combat, or like the boiling of water in a pot over a fire, then a locall remoti|on, which neverthele&s;&s;e I refer to Naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;treight begins Northward at the <HI>Cape</HI> of eleven thou|&s;and Virgins, as <HI>Magellan</HI> called it, and ends Southward at <HI>Cape Victoria</HI>: in the middle &s;tood the Towne and Fortre&s;&s;e of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> which afterwards, the Inhabitants peri&s;hing with hunger and cold was called the Port of Famine.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that pa&s;&s;ed this &s;treight was <HI>Ferdinand Magallanes</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> who had both heard and &s;een &s;omething of it in their cards. 'Twas in 1519. when he went to find a road to the <HI>Moluccas</HI> that way, for <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth.</P>
<P>Afterwards one <HI>Pedro Sarmicates</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treight from North to South; from South to North few pa&s;&s;e, for the dan|ger and difficulty to find the way. Since that the famous <HI>Argonautes</HI> who went round the world by Sea, as Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in one thou&s;and five hundred &s;eventy nine, <HI>Candi&s;h</HI> in one thou&s;and five hundred eighty five, <HI>Oliuier de Nort</HI> in one thou&s;and five hundred ninety nine, and of fre&s;her memory <HI>Spilberg, le Maire, Hermita,</HI> and others. But <HI>le Maire</HI> in 1618. a little further, in &s;ome fifty &s;ix or fifty &s;even degrees, towards the South, found the new Streight, called by his own name much &s;horter, and much ea&s;ier than the other, not being above eight leagues in length, and the breadth wide and facile: the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came thither afterwards, and gave it the name Saint <HI>Vin|cent.</HI></P>

<P>Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> found many good Harbours in the Streight, where good fre&s;h waters came; but they are not ea&s;y to enter, for the &s;trong and turbulent windes that raigne there. The Land on both &s;ides lies exceeding high, and banked with in|acce&s;&s;ible Mountains, particularly on the South and Ea&s;t, where they are ever covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>The breadth in &s;ome places is of two, three, or foure leagues, in the narrowe&s;t of one, or of two musket &s;hots. 'Tis exce&s;&s;ive cold, and never without &s;now and ice, the trees notwith&s;tanding ever green, and laden with fruit.</P>
<P>From this Streight by <HI>Cape Foendo,</HI> and the White <HI>Cape,</HI> they a&s;cend again into the &s;ilver river, where begins <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> in 35 de|grees beyond the line, reaching to the River of <HI>Amazons,</HI> under the Line.

Others derive it from the great lake called <HI>Eupania,</HI> where the other Rivers take birth, as <HI>Marag|non,</HI> but it &s;hould rather be <HI>Parana,</HI> which afterwards falls in|to the &s;ilver River.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that came within the mouth of this River, was <HI>Americus Ve&s;putius,</HI> &s;ent by the King of <HI>Portugall</HI> to di&s;cover <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> in the yeare fifteen hundered and one, and &s;uppo&s;ing it a pa&s;&s;age from the South &s;ea to the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> &s;atisfied him&s;elfe, and returned without looking farther.</P>

<P>Another a&s;ked me one day why we Chri&s;tians would ha|zard our lives in &s;o long voyages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Savages indued with rea|&s;on.</NOTE> if it were to &s;ee or po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e their countrey, to which we had no right? and &s;aying 'twas for neither, but onely to fetch &s;ome things of gaine a|mong&s;t them: and what gaine, &s;aid he, a &s;curvy piece of wood, and other things as little worth? And telling him, that wood was of value in our countrey, and u&s;efull to our livelyhood: And how, &s;aid he, is your countrey &s;o wretch|ed, it yields you not &s;ufficient for life, and &s;u&s;tenance?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, the countrey had a good &s;ufficiency in it to maintain us; but we de&s;ired to get wealth for the felicity of our &s;elves and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>And what &s;ayes he, will the&s;e riches advance you in Gods favour, will they pre&s;erve from death, or can you carry them with you? and replying, 'twas for none of all this, but that we took a felicity to leave it to our children: Well, &s;aid he, if the &s;oyle were &s;ufficient to maintain you and your Fathers before you, why &s;hould it not do the &s;ame for your chil|dren and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>They alledge the &s;ame rea&s;on, when we blame them for not cultivating their land, &s;aying &s;ince it kept their fathers, 'twill not faile to maintain them and their children. So the&s;e &s;illy people live free from all pa&s;&s;ion, avarice, ambition, envie, and labour of body or &s;pirit.</P>
<P>If they get any thing that is good, they call in their neigh|bours, and make merry together, with perfect friend&s;hip, candor, and freedome, without quarrels or calumnies, go freely to one another, and eat what they finde, with a good will.</P>
<P>They have a drink of the root <HI>Cavain,</HI> which the <HI>Carmels</HI> call <HI>Piroa,</HI> made thus, they boyle the root with water, and when they u&s;e it, they &s;tirre it together and drink it warm, this ta&s;tes like turned milk, but in &s;ome places for a dainty,
<PB N="402" REF="208">
the maids chew the root, then boyle it, and make a mo&s;t ex|qui&s;it drink.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts there is a &s;ort of root called <HI>Elcout,</HI> of the ta&s;te of a nut, which I hold the be&s;t among&s;t them, 'tis of great vertues, but the exce&s;&s;e dries; infu&s;ed with ano|ther called <HI>Monqueil,</HI> it purges without violence: they have an herb that growes low with leaves a hand-broad, that cures all &s;orts of &s;oares and wounds, of which I had once a triall. For falling from a rock, I got &s;even or eight very trouble&s;ome hurts, and an <HI>Indian</HI> with this leafe, cured me in three dayes.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the &s;ame in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> al&s;o, and believe 'tis in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Another root they have called a <HI>Jehearit,</HI> that purges like <HI>Rhubarbe,</HI> but more gently: I believe 'tis the &s;ame that comes from new <HI>Spain</HI> called <HI>Mechouacan.</HI></P>
<P>Another that purges, being laid Emplai&s;ter-wi&s;e on the &s;tomack: women lay it on the heads of their daughters, to emit their <HI>Me&s;truits</HI> making them &s;tand with their feet together upon a &s;tone, and a &s;leight inci&s;ion, to draw that blood with|out pain.</P>
<P><HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI>, and chiefly the <HI>Toupina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ba</HI> are kinde to &s;tran|gers, &s;pecially the <HI>French,</HI> and freely part with their victu|als to them.</P>
<P>A woman when &s;he would be kinde, or entertain one, &s;he &s;eats her &s;elf on the ground, and weeps as &s;he had been beaten, then on a &s;uddain addre&s;&s;es her &s;elf with a thou&s;and blan|di&s;hments, inviting him freely to the plea&s;ure of her daugh|ters. I have knowne &s;ome &s;o ba&s;e among&s;t us, that buckled with the&s;e idolatrous girles, a thing mo&s;t dete&s;table.</P>
<P>They are ab&s;olutely without letters or characters, and in pronunciation u&s;e not <HI>F. L. R.</HI> So as we may thence derive, they are without Faith, without Law, and with|out Royalty.</P>
<P>They are addicted to Divinations and &s;uper&s;titions, and their Prie&s;ts are &s;orcerers: by an ancient tradition they have &s;ome ob&s;cure knowledge of the deluge: &s;ome believe re|ward and puni&s;hment of good and evill after death, others, not; but all believe the immortality of the &s;oule, and that they &s;hall remain the &s;ame they were in this life, and at the houre of their death: they interre their dead, and for &s;everal dayes lay meat in the Sepulcher, with a cotton bed: they have no King, nor &s;uperiour to command them, every linage living apart in a &s;everal valley, and change their habitation according to fancy; many families living under the &s;ame roof: great hunters, fi&s;hers, and &s;wimmers, ex|ceeding

vindicative: of a turbulent &s;pirit, and inclined to Warre, the &s;ame in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, endure hun|ger with patience, when they have nothing to eat, and when they have they gourmandize, and drink drunk after their fa&s;hion. The good or evill that befalls them &s;ome attribute to de&s;tiny, others to fortune or chance.</P>
<P>They are divided into &s;everal nations, and for the mo&s;t part enemies: as the <HI>Sourons,</HI> and the <HI>Carmils,</HI> and the <HI>Ta|pus,</HI> whom they call Savages, who are enemies to all, as more wilde and bloody then the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cariges</HI> are more &s;oft and humane, who inhabit be|yond the Winter Tropick two leagues from the Sea; they inhabit on high ground, and &s;ow the <HI>Mandior:</HI> then there are the <HI>Oeuetacas, Margaiars, Toupinanbas,</HI> and others: the&s;e la&s;t are tho&s;e our <HI>French</HI> have had commerce withall, of whom we have ample printed relations: and there might have had good plantations, had we made u&s;e of our time, and moderated our pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. The I&s;le of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> according to a de&s;cription made to the Authour, by <HI>Sieur de la Courb,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;sis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis I&s;land is under the Equinoctiall between the I&s;les of <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Anchan,</HI> di&s;covered by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in their fir&s;t navigation to the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> hath fifty leagues of &s;ound land, was di&s;covered on Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> day, that gave name of it. It beares little more then Sugar-Canes, planted by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but the trees are ever green. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> built here the town <HI>Pauoazan,</HI> The Haven whereof looks towards <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>At fir&s;t all Nations inhabited there, but at pre&s;ent the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> will have none but them&s;elves, and the <HI>French</HI> who are exceedingly beloved, for a <HI>French</HI> Je&s;uite who propaga|ted Religion exceedingly in this I&s;le.</P>
<P>The natives are &s;ome white, &s;ome black, and marry &s;till in their own colour. The town is plea&s;ant, and the whole land is full of Sugar-Canes, which fill the I&s;land with flyes, as <HI>Arabia</HI> is infe&s;ted with the &s;ame creatures by rea&s;on of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia</HI> there: Sugar is &s;o cheap, that for eight Realls you may have a hundred weight, but it has this fault, 'twill not ea&s;ily dry; in exchange they carry thither Wines, Chee&s;e, Leather, Clothes, becau&s;e neither Vine, nor Corne, will pro&s;per there.</P>
<P>Upon a Vine there the grape will be green on one &s;ide, and ripe on the other; and blo&s;&s;oms at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Their Gardens produce all &s;orts of herbes and fruit, but &s;tone-fruit; but above all, Figges, and Melons.</P>
<P>The root <HI>Igname</HI> growes there in abundance, very whole|&s;ome boyled, or raw.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e <HI>Millet</HI> which they call <HI>Zaboucou,</HI> whereof they make excellent things with Sugar; the &s;oyle is &s;trong, in|clining to a yellow, and in &s;ome parts reddi&s;h, where the dew of the night tempers it like waxe, &s;o as it never comes to du&s;t: They bend their Sugar-Canes to the Ea&s;t, and &s;ay they pro&s;|per be&s;t then: they may have there &s;ome &s;eventy Sugar|mills.</P>
<P>The&s;e Engines or Mills, re&s;emble the <HI>Samaritane</HI> at <HI>Pont|neuf</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> ea&s;ily ri&s;ing and falling.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="211">That which di&s;plea&s;es is, they pour it into great caldrons, and it is like honey, then they make it in loaves hardly dry, you never &s;eeing any &s;o &s;olid from thence as from <HI>Madero,</HI> nor is it worth &s;o much though they u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible art to refine it: They purify it with cindars. At the plantations far from water the Blacks fetch water to &s;et the mills at work. The &s;ugar being drawn they give the canes to the &s;wine, which fattens them, and makes the fle&s;h of excellent ta&s;te, and whol&s;ome; from mid-May to mid-Augu&s;t they have Ea&s;tern winds where|with they dry their Sugars, without which they could never do it; for all other windes are adver&s;aries to them, becau&s;e of the raines they &s;tirr up in the other months.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is unhealthfull by rea&s;on of the corrupted ayr: their hou&s;es are good, built and covered with timber, out of the abundance of huge high trees.</P>
<P>All nations heretofore went thither by rea&s;on of franck traffick; but now they mu&s;t pay tribute, all but the <HI>French,</HI> who enjoy the &s;ame immunities as the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>They have many &s;laves from <HI>Guinea,</HI> brought by the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> to be &s;old.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Ribaut Diepois</HI> took a ve&s;&s;ell with diver&s;e whole families, men, women, and children, whom he &s;et free on land, but cau&s;ed two Blacks to hang the Ma&s;ter and five Mar|riners. 'Tis a cruell inhumanity to carry the Father away by violence into perpetuall &s;lavery, while his poor family is ex|po&s;ed to mi&s;ery and &s;tarving. They marry the &s;laves among&s;t them&s;elves, for breed, like a race of hor&s;es; who continue &s;laves by inheritance: whereas in the Ea&s;t at ten yeares end they are made free-men: they have but one day in the weeke free to them&s;elves, which they employ indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly, in making them&s;elves fine to be acceptable to their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> following the humour of their Nation, have a vanity to have their &s;laves grow rich, and walke with gravity like them, and will give them a hundred or two hundred Crownes, to buy <HI>Turks</HI> for their gain and ea&s;e. They bring the greater part to be baptized, and marry together, pro|viding them of a livelyhood. They celebrate certain fea&s;ts like the <HI>Basks,</HI> with drums beaten by hand, and &s;ongs to them, and have their meetings under the &s;hade of trees. The &s;laves yearly choo&s;e one among&s;t them for their Prince, to command and go|vern at their meetings, who &s;eats him&s;elf in the middle, and then they give him one of the&s;e drums, and with both hands above his head he makes a mo&s;t harmonious mu&s;ick, to|gether with flutes, and other in&s;truments, looking on their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es with a thou&s;and munkey tricks, while they dance and
<PB N="406" REF="212">
trip <HI>More&s;co Sarabrands</HI> to them again. They go together to fetch their Prince at his Ma&s;ters, who fir&s;t makes them a colla|tion, then bringing forth the Prince decked with flowers, a &s;cepter in one hand, and a no&s;egay in the other, they carry him on their &s;houlders in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> to the place of dancing, where their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es meet them. The Prince fir&s;t dances with his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, &amp; then the others follow. The Prince <HI>de la' amour,</HI> called the <HI>Ar|cadit,</HI> &s;alutes his Lady, and then with gravity pre&s;ents her the Po&s;ie, which &s;he receives, and dances with amorous &s;miles and &s;impers. Afterwards they all attend the Prince to his Ma&s;ters hou&s;e, where the nuptials are con&s;ummated, provided they be|come Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>At that time <HI>Sieur de la Courb</HI> was there, there was a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Lady, widow of a Merchant, called <HI>Bornauente,</HI> rich, fair, and young, to whom the chiefe&s;t of the I&s;land &s;ued for marriage, and &s;he would give ear to none, becau&s;e &s;he would not put her &s;elf under &s;ubjection. She kept divers &s;laves, and there arriving a ve&s;&s;el laden with &s;laves, &s;he bought &s;ome, and one among&s;t the re&s;t of &s;o hand&s;ome garb and addre&s;&s;e, &s;he judged him to be of good extraction, whereupon a&s;ked whence he was? he told her he was of <HI>Danieta,</HI> the Son of a wealthy Nobleman, who had intelligence of his capti|vity, and would &s;hortly free him, that he was taken fi&s;hing in a &s;mall boat; and enquiring further of his religion, &s;he per|ceived he was an Idolater.</P>
<P>But the Lady taken with his gracefull behaviour, u&s;ed him with all po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;&s;e, and one day her lu&s;t bearing her away, &s;he re&s;olved to call him to her Chamber, and receive a &s;atisfaction from him; for which purpo&s;e having &s;ent for him, in expectation &s;he lay down upon her bed, fell fa&s;t a|&s;leep, and in a dream thought &s;omething came that rude|ly pulled the &s;heet from under her: waking affrighted, &s;he called her maid, and related the vi&s;ion to her; the maid wi&s;hed her to lay by &s;uch troubles, and commend her &s;elfe cordially to Almighty God: On the morrow &s;he ro&s;e early and went to her Confe&s;&s;or, to whom &s;he related the whole, and he gave her for penance to &s;ell this &s;lave, and never to &s;ee him more; promi&s;ing he would be her chapman, and buy him to be his boatman, when he went to take the aire.</P>
<P>The Lady made her advantage of his proffer, and doubting the &s;lave to be &s;ome Demon or Magician &s;ent him to the Prie&s;t, who bought him to his &s;ad misfortune; for rowing along by the &s;hore to take the air, there came a &s;udden gu&s;t from the land that over|turned the boat: Now the Prie&s;t &s;wimming well made to &s;hore, but the &s;lave with a pole da&s;hed his brains out, and him&s;elf was never heard of after.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="212">In this I&s;land the Rats do great mi&s;chief, eating their Sugar loaves, what&s;oever they can do to prevent it. Here upon a Mountain there are certain trees that di&s;till water continually, as in the I&s;le of Iron in the <HI>Canaries</HI>; the&s;e trees are ever hooded with a thick cloud, which moy&s;tens them in &s;uch &s;ort that they yield &s;ufficient to water all their fields of Sugar|canes, whereas that in the I&s;le of Iron di&s;tills but at certain hours.</P>
