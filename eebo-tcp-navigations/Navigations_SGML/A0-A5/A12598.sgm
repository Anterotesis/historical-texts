<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is the observation of some anci|ent Philosophers (who also prove it by divers good arguments) that all men, for the most part, have a naturall desire to <HI>immortality.</HI> But this we all know by common approv'd experi|ence, that <HI>Man that is borne of a Woman is of short continuance. He commethforth like a Flower and is cut downe, he flyeth also as a shadow and continueth not.</HI> Some therefore who knew not of any other world after this, in defence of natures wayes and providence, maintained, that she had in some manner satisfied the desire of man in making him <HI>generative. Nam quodammodo ipse putatur vivere, cujus progenies vivit, (For that man in some sort may be thought yet alive, whose progeny is living)</HI> as I may say in the words of <HI>Cassiodore</HI> with little al|teration. But if there be any immortality in this,
<PB REF="5">
it can be but an immortality of the body, not of the minde, the best and chiefest part of man. The immortality of the minde (all that it is capa|ble of in this world, which though it be not im|mortality properly, yet may certainely much conduce to allay the complaints of mortall men concerning their shortnesse of life) doth, as I conceive, especially depend from that <HI>Memoria praeteritorum,</HI> and <HI>Providentia futurorum, (Re|membrance of things past,</HI> and <HI>Foresight of things to come)</HI> which the Latine Orator speakes of.</P>
<P>As for the first, he certainly that knowes no more of the world (the time of a mans life be|ing so short as it is) then what hath happened in his time, though he may be in yeares, and per|chance very old in regard of his body, yet in re|gard of his minde and knowledge, he can be accounted but a very child. Which is the very answer that an ancient <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priest and Anti|quary gave to <HI>Solon</HI> concerning the <HI>Grecians</HI> of his time: that they were all, the best and ancien|test of them, but very babes and children. And his reason was, because none of them could say any thing of the state of their owne countrey be|yond their owne and their fathers memory: whereas the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> out of their ancient holy Records, could tell them many memorable things, both concerning <HI>Greece</HI> in generall, and the state of their then famous <HI>Athens</HI> in particular,
<PB REF="5">
for many hundred, if not thousand, of yeares before. If therefore a man living in a place of note, can by his industry, out of undoubted Re|cords and Monuments (if such be the happy con|dition of the place, that it afford them) certainly finde, what have beene the severall both <HI>materi|all alterations</HI> (as in respect of buildings, and the like) and <HI>historicall events,</HI> that have happened to it for divers ages before, and can derive the present times and places that he lives in, by a continuall series of chances and alterations from such or such a beginning, I doe not see (if know|ledge be granted to be the life of the soule, as the soule is the life of the body) but he may reck on his yeares according to the proportion of his know|ledge, accounting himselfe to have lived so many yeares, as he is able truely and historically to give an account of.</P>
<P>Now for that other part of immortality, which is <HI>Providentia futurorum,</HI> even this hath such dependance of the former, as that he that is well vers'd in the knowledge of things past, may probably foresee what will happen in time to come. As for example; It was no difficult thing for one of the ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> (who lived in the dayes of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and was one of his Audi|tors) having observed the course of the world, and what had already hapned to <HI>Greece</HI> it selfe, and to other places in that kinde, to foretell of
<PB REF="6">
old <HI>Greece,</HI> then flourishing, that the time would come when it should be the seate of <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Barbarisme;</HI> as it is at this day. Vpon the same grounds of former ages experience, did ano|ther of the ancients both foresee and foretel, above a thousand yeares before any such thing happen|ed, the discovery of a new world, in these re|markeable words of his:
<Q><L>&mdash;Venient annis</L>
<L>Seculaseris, quibus Oceanus</L>
<L>Vincularerum laxet, &amp; ingens</L>
<L>Pateat tell us, Tiphysque novos</L>
<L>Detegat orbes: nec sit terris</L>
<L>Vltima Thule.</L></Q></P>
<P>As the knowledge of ancient things is pleasant, so is the ignorance as shamefull, and oftentimes exposes men to the scorne and contempt of stran|gers. <HI>Tully</HI> relates of himselfe, that being sent with authority to <HI>Syracusa,</HI> a <HI>quondam</HI> renowned City of <HI>Sicilia,</HI> for his owne private satisfaction, he enquired of the chiefest of the City about the sepulcher and monument of their famous <HI>Archi|medes;</HI> who (through shamefull ignorance of their City-Antiquities) denyed that he had any. But <HI>Tully</HI> knowing the contrary by what he had read, and by good luck remembring some cer|taine verses that mentioned some particulars of his monument, whereby it might be knowne from others, taking along with him those <HI>vene|rable
<PB REF="6">
blocks</HI> (who, as ordinary worldly men, had no care but for their profit, no curiosity but for their belly) he repaired to the place, being neer the City-gates, where ancient sepulchers and monuments were most frequent, and so negle|cted (whereby you may judge of the temper of the Inhabitants) that they were almost all over|growne with thickets and bushes. But the place being cleered by men that were on purpose set on worke, he found at last by helpe of the fore said directions, the monument that he sought, with the very markes (a <HI>Sphaera,</HI> and a <HI>Cylindrus)</HI> and the inscription (though now halfe worne out, more through neglect then age) that he looked for. And so, to the great shame of that City, and the inhabitants thereof (noted abroad for their luxurious life and great excesse in all worldly things) concludes with these upbraiding insul|ting words: <HI>Ita nobilissima Graeciae civitas, quonda~ ver&ograve; etiam doctissima sui civis unius acutissimi monu|mentum ignorasset, nisi ab homine Arpinate didi|cisset.</HI> As if a man should scoffingly object to us here of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> that he was faine to come out of <HI>Wales</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> of purpose to shew us the monument and place of buriall of some one of our famous <HI>Abbats,</HI> or renowned <HI>Archbishops,</HI> whose credit, and bounty, when living, had re|dounded much to the honour and benefit of the City.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
For these and the like reasons, my thoughts and affections having ever much inclined to the search and study of <HI>Antiquities,</HI> (to which also my particular calling did in some manner leade me) I have more particularly, as bound in duty and thankfulnesse, applyed my selfe to the <HI>Anti|quities</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the place of my birth and abode. And to me this was a sufficient motive why I should of all other places desire to know the antiquities and former estate thereof. But why any man else, that is an <HI>Englishman,</HI> should have the same desire, other reasons may be given, very considerable, if I be not much deceived; as first, the <HI>Antiquities</HI> thereof. <HI>Antiquities</HI> due and proper <HI>Epithete</HI> is, <HI>venerable.</HI> Now the in|terest which our City hath in that venerable badge and cognisance is not unknowne: it being ac|knowledged for one of the most ancient Cities in the Kingdome. <HI>Quiacivitas Cantuariae est una de antiquissimis urbibus Angliae,</HI> is no other language then is frequently found in the <HI>Charters,</HI> and such <HI>private Acts of Parliament,</HI> as (making that a maine motive to the grant) have conveyed any <HI>Favour,</HI> or <HI>Franchise</HI> to the City or Citizens. Se|condly, the great <HI>fame</HI> and <HI>repute</HI> that it had a|broad, for reasons that will appeare by this <HI>Trea|tise:</HI> and thereupon the great resort of strangers from all nations under heaven, (which in proba|bilitie gave occasion to the proverbe of <HI>Canter|bury-tales)</HI>
<PB REF="7">
to the number sometimes, as shall be shewed, of a hundred thousand at once. But the chiefe reason, in my judgement, ought to be, be|cause from thence first the faith of <HI>Christ</HI> was pro|pagated and derived unto other parts of the Realme of <HI>England,</HI> after the <HI>Saxons</HI> our fore|fathers were become Lords and possessors of it. When the <HI>Romans</HI> had conquered <HI>Greece,</HI> they did not use them as they did other nations com|monly by them subdued, but with all love and respect, <HI>Athens</HI> especially, which they had in ho|nour (say ancient <HI>Geographers</HI> of those times;) and, in token of their respect, suffered them to enjoy their ancient <HI>lawes, liberties</HI> and <HI>forme of go|vernment,</HI> as though they had not beene conque|red. <HI>Tully</HI> gives the reason. <HI>Cum ei hominum generi praesimus non modo in quo ipsa sit, sed etiam &agrave; quo ad alios pervenisse putetur humanitas: cert&egrave; iis eam po|tissim&ugrave;m tribuere debemus, &agrave; quibus accepimus.</HI> And doe not all piously-affected <HI>English</HI> owe so much honour and respect to the place, from whence the light of Christs glorious Gospell first shined unto their fore fathers, as to desire to be acquainted with the present and past estate of it?</P>
<P>I have spoken of <HI>religion</HI> onely, but I might adde <HI>humanitatem, learning</HI> and good <HI>literature</HI> too. For with <HI>religion</HI> came <HI>learning:</HI> and in the dayes of <HI>Theodorus</HI> the seventh Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> (if publike schooles wherein all good
<PB REF="8">
Arts and Sciences, <HI>philosophy</HI> especially, are lear|nedly taught and professed make an <HI>Vniversity) Canterbury</HI> was a <HI>famous Vniversity:</HI> yea, and was afterwards a patterne (as some have written and published) for the erection and foundation of a famous <HI>Vniversity</HI> in this land.</P>
<P>This worke is chiefly collected from old <HI>Ma|nuscripts, Leiger-bookes</HI> and other <HI>Records</HI> of cre|dit, exhibited to me for the most part by the Treasury of our <HI>Cathedrall;</HI> which, as it exceeds most of the Realme, if not all, in beauty, state|linesse, and magnificence of building; so in this particular kinde of unvaluable treasure, is, as I con|ceive, inferior unto none. With the helpe of <HI>Spots History of Canterbury</HI> mentioned of <HI>Balaeus,</HI> and of <HI>Iohn Twine's</HI> collections of the Antiquities thereof spoken of by him in his <HI>Commentaries, de rebus Albionicis, &amp;c.</HI> could I but have gotten them, I should perchance have brought the work to more perfection: but with the helpes I have had, I have done my best endeavour that nothing might be strange or unknowne that carries with it any shew of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> either in the <HI>Church,</HI> (as the most eminent place of all) or in the <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Suburbs</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Worke</HI> may not deserve thine acceptance (courteous Reader) for it selfe, let then the <HI>Authors</HI> love to <HI>Antiquities,</HI> his <HI>thankfull intentions</HI> to|wards the <HI>place</HI> of his <HI>birth, education</HI> and <HI>present
<PB REF="8">
abode,</HI> and the <HI>encouragement</HI> of <HI>worthy friends</HI> serve for his <HI>Apology.</HI> If otherwise it give thee some content, and mine endeavours prove accep|table unto thee, I shall desire thou wouldest be thankfull to them, without whose <HI>helpe,</HI> as I had not beene <HI>able,</HI> so without whose <HI>encouragement</HI> I had neither beene <HI>willing,</HI> thus to have adven|tured forth in publike, as namely Doctor <HI>Casau|bon,</HI> one of the Prebendaries of this Church, and <HI>Thomas Denne</HI> Esquire: to whom, for their great and ready favour and furtherance herein, I were conscious of much ingratitude and want of ingenuity, if I should not acknowledge my selfe exceedingly beholden. Such as it is I commend it to thy favourable acceptance, (friendly Reader) and shall adde no more but the best wishes and respects of</P>

<HEAD>THE ANTIQVITIE OF CANTERBVRIE.</HEAD>
<P>_SO great and Universall is the respect that is worthily given to venerable Antiquity, that not any one orna|ment sets off any place, whether City or other, with greater lustre, or more proclaimes and applauds their Judgment that first selected the place for Habitation, then the true and knowne Antiquity, and long duration of the place.</P>
<P>Now no one thing almost of this nature that discourse shall offer to the consideration of an English man, especi|ally a Kentish man, shall finde more vulgar beleefe, nor is better grounded in tradition, then (my maine motive to the ensuing treatise) the Antiquity of this our City. And then it, what more celebrated in (the living Monuments of their deceased Authors) our stories and other like workes of English Writers? For brevity sake (which I shall study throughout my whole discourse) the Testimo|nies
<PB N="2" REF="14">
only of two, M^r. <HI>Cambden</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Britannia. <HI>In</HI> Kent.</NOTE>, our moderne <HI>Chorogra|pher,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Hist. lib. 6. De An. Dom. 10 11.</NOTE> one of our elder Histori|ans, as sufficient to justifie so knowne a verity, shall suffice for instance. Who, in the places here marginally quoted, have set and left the note and marke of Antiquity upon the place. And no marvell, when as in the English-Saxons time, and even in the beginning of their Heptarchy, it was the head or chiefe City of the Kentish Kingdome, and the Kings seate. <HI>Imperii Regis Ethelberti Metropolis,</HI> so <HI>Bede. Caput imperii, &amp;c.</HI> so others call it. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Florileg. ad An. Dom. 596.</NOTE> <HI>In civitate</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Eccles. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 25.</NOTE> <HI>famosa, quae antiquo vocabulo Dorovernia dicitur:</HI> is the close of a Charter of <HI>Kenulph</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> in the yeere 810.</P>
<P>As for the further discovery of the yet greater Anti|quity of the place, if any shall desire it; let him consider with me in the next place, the names that former times have knowne it by. As the Saxons of old <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Cambden <HI>in Kent.</HI></NOTE> called Kent, <GAP DESC="foreign"> (i. the Countrey of the men of Kent:) So the name which they gave to this our City was <GAP DESC="foreign"> (i. the Kentish mens City, Court, or Borough:) A name well agreeing with that of <HI>Cair-Kent,</HI> or <HI>Caer-Kent</HI> (the City of Kent) as <HI>Nennius</HI> and the Britaines cal|led it. What time the Romane Empire extended it selfe hither, it was of them called <HI>Durovernum;</HI> haply from the British, <HI>Durwhern,</HI> rendred by my Author <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Cambden ubi supra.</NOTE>, a swift River, such as our Stoure is: or else (as one <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Twyne. De Reb. Abion. lib. 1. pag. 113.</NOTE> will) from <HI>Thorowbourne,</HI> because of the Rivers running through the City. With very little variation from which Romane name, you may finde that our elder Historians, <HI>Bede,</HI> and others called it <HI>Dorovernia,</HI> and <HI>Dorobernia:</HI> and that you see before, in the yeare 810. was called <HI>Antiquum voca|bulum;</HI> and yet long afterwards in use, even untill that of <HI>Cantuaria,</HI> better answering to the English-Saxon, <HI>Cant|warabyrig,</HI> and from about the Normane Conquest hither|ward, more frequently then the other; and in time alto|gether
<PB N="3" REF="14">
taken up and used, made it give her place. But of our Citie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> names see more if you please in the <HI>Antiquit. Britan. pag.</HI> 34.</P>
<P>Cleerely then <HI>Canterbury</HI> had an existence in the time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Canterbury</HI> in being in the Romanes time.</NOTE> of the Romanes Empire here. Let me adde, and before, in the preceding Britaines time too, as to me seemes somewhat evident from hence, that the Romane <HI>Durover|num,</HI> is seemingly no other then the Latine-rendring of the Britaine <HI>Durwhern;</HI> by which or neere a like name (most probably) the Romanes found it called by the Bri|tains at their coming. However the mention of it in the Emperour <HI>Antonines Itinerary,</HI> more I take it, then foure|teene hundred yeares old, and the many pieces of Ro|mane Coyne, both of his, and also of preceding, and succeeding Emperours, found almost in all parts of the City; (some whereof are come to my hands) are evident tokens of the places great Antiquity. A thing not doub|ted of a farre more learned, and judicious Surveyor of our City, M^r. <HI>Cambden</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Britannia. <HI>Of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>in</HI> Kent.</NOTE>, in whose opinion it was famous in the Romanes time.</P>
<P>One strong argument whereof amongst the rest, are the present remaines of a double Military way of theirs; the great Stone-causeys, I meane, directly leading from two of their famous havens, <HI>Dubris</HI> and <HI>Lemanis;</HI> unto this our City, the former by Barham-downe, the latter by Stone-streete.</P>
<P>But (will some say:) what make I loytering here? It is neither in the Saxon, nor yet the Romane, neither the intervening Britain's time, that we are to expect the find|ing of our Cities Originall. It's much elder: <HI>Rome</HI> it selfe <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elder then <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> not so old. Indeed I read that one <HI>Rud-hudibras</HI> or <HI>Lud|rudibras</HI> a King of the Britains almost nine hundred years, before our Saviours Incarnation, was our Cities Founder. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of whom founded.</NOTE> So sayes the Author of the British story, a Writer, though by the best of our Antiquaries <HI>(Cambden</HI> especially) for
<PB N="4" REF="15">
the generality of his History exploded, as fabulous; yet in this particular followed by divers men of Judgement, and good Antiquaries too <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Author Anti|quit. Brit. Lam|bert.

Speed.</NOTE>: with what warrant, as I can|not determine, so neither will I examine, but leave it as I finde it to the scanning of others. So much for our Cities Originall and Antiquity.</P>
<P>Now what was the generall state and condition of it in either the Britains, Romans, Saxons, or Danes times: no man may exact or expect any accompt of me, in regard no History, or other Record enables me to show it.

<HEAD>The Citie wall, and Gates therein.</HEAD>
<P>VVHen <HI>Canterbury</HI> was first enclosed with a wall, I think, is no where to be found in story, or other record, either private or publick. Tokens of the walls good antiquitie are the British bricks, to be seen at <HI>Riding|gate,</HI> at the gate also now done up, sometime leading from the Castle-yard to <HI>Wencheape,</HI> and at <HI>Queningate,</HI> or rather (if you will) at the place in the wall, where once the gate so called stood, and is now also made up. But in greatest plenty, upon the bank on either side the River behinde S. <HI>Mildreds</HI> Church in the remaines of the wall there. And that the City was walled in before the Norman conquest, is evident by the testimonie of <HI>Roger Hoveden</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Annal. Par. prior.</NOTE>, who rela|ting the siege and surprisall of the Citie by the Danes, in the time of King <HI>Etheldred, Anno Christi</HI> 1011. tells us, that (amongst particulars of the Danish crueltie, wreaked on the poore English people of the Citie) many of them being by the Danes cast headlong from the wall of the Citie met with death in the precipice.</P>
<P>This may be further proved by severall Records of our Cathedrall, making mention of this wall in the English-Saxons time <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">In Archivis ecclesiae Christi. <HI>Cantuar.</HI></NOTE>. But that I may not seem to loyter, I pur|posely passe them by, and proceed to elder evidence. Now the first and most ancient mention of our City wall (I conceive) offers it self in King <HI>Ethelberts</HI> charter of the site of the Monastery called (from him, for whose sake it was founded of King <HI>Ethelbert)</HI> S. <HI>Augustines,</HI> da|ted <HI>Anno Christi</HI> 605. The ground therein set out for that intent being described to lie, <HI>sub orientali muro Civitatis Dorob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rniae.</HI> A plain argument of the Cities walling at that time, and (as I conjecture) Archbishop <HI>Parker's</HI> warrant for his <HI>Hanc muro cinctam</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Antiq. Brit. pag. 34.</NOTE>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where he reports the do|nation of this City, with the Royaltie thereof by King
<PB N="7" REF="16">
<HI>Ethelbert</HI> to <HI>Augustine.</HI> And that it was then walled, may hence be further argued, that as <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessour long after, is said to build S. <HI>Peters</HI> Church in <HI>Westminster</HI> without <HI>London-</HI>City-Wall, purposely for the place of his owne Sepulture <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Post aleos vide <HI>Cambd.</HI> in Middlesex.</NOTE>: so one maine end of the worke of that <HI>Augustinian</HI> Monastery, was (as both <HI>Ethelb.</HI> and <HI>Aug.</HI> in their severall Charters intimate) that it might be a Cimi|tery or place of buriall for them and their successors; the Kings and Archbishops of the place for ever. And why? but even because of the then unlawfulnesse of buriall within Cities, and other walled Townes, a thing, by that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Though the Saxons in likelyhood re|garded not that Romane law, yet <HI>Au|stine,</HI> being a Romane did.</NOTE> Law of the twelve Tables <HI>(Hominem mortuum infra ur|bem ne sepelito, neve urito.)</HI> flatly forbidden. So have I briefly trac'd our City Wals to the furthest of their known Antiquity.</P>
<P>But, by the way, I may not conceale from you, what suspicion there is of (these Heralds of our City Wals An|tiquity:) the <HI>Ethelbertine</HI> Charters to be fictitious and counterfeit. S^r. <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> that learned and worthi|ly admired Antiqua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y hath that opinion of them. And indeed, there is a note to be found in the Records of our Cathedrall <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Vide Dom. <HI>Hen. Spelman.</HI> Tom. 1. Concil. pag. 125.</NOTE>: which confirmes the suspicion. It tels us, that untill <HI>Withred</HI> (King of <HI>Kent)</HI> about the yeere of grace 700. that Church did peaceably enjoy it lands &amp; liberties, onely by custome, <HI>ex antiquo more,</HI> without any charters or other written muniments. Could it now be truly ad|ded that <HI>Withreds</HI> is the first and most ancient muniment of that Church, judging of the one by the other, this would give great cause of suspicion of the truth of those Ethelbertine charters. But in regard, that severall mu|niments of elder times then <HI>Withreds,</HI> as one of King <HI>Ed|bald</HI> sonne and successour of <HI>Ethelb:</HI> and two of <HI>Cedwalla</HI> the west-Saxon, made to this very Cathedrall, are to this day extant, being registred at length in the Leigers of that Church (I speak <HI>ex proprio visis)</HI> and, if judgement
<PB N="8" REF="17">
may be given by the agreement of the hands, even by the very pen of the authour of that note, there is more cause in my judgement to suspect that note, of falsitie, then those charters, which it may seem to question, of forgery.</P>
<P>But the noble Knight sets before you (if you please to peruse them) other reasons for his opinion. I referre you to them, and them to your consideration: and so passe on to further discourse of our Citie wall. Which I conceive carries yet greater antiquitie, then hitherto hath been spo|ken of. For (if as <HI>Huntington</HI> affirms it was) <HI>Canterbury</HI> were one of the 28 Cities infamousing this Iland in the Britains times, and of them called <HI>Kair-Chent,</HI> taking this note along with us, that <HI>Kair</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caius</HI> de An|tiquitate <HI>Can|tabrig.</HI> lib. 16. 1</NOTE> with them signified a wall|defenced town or City, we need not doubt but it was walled in their times. And so much for the walls antiqui|tie, now I passe to after-accidents that have betided it.</P>
<P>The City (as I have given you a former touch) being by the <HI>Danes,</HI> in the dayes of King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> besieged, taken, and with the Cathedrall (as all our Chronologers agree) burnt and utterly wasted; the City wall (no doubt) being the Cities best securitie against a like surprisall, if it should still have stood, was not spared by that all-wasting enemy.</P>
<P>I read that Archbishop <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> in the Conquerours time, was a great benefactour to the repaire of it. So saith M^r. <HI>Lambert</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Perambula|tion of <HI>Kent.</HI> In <HI>Canterbury.</HI></NOTE>, and so <HI>Stow,</HI> followed by <HI>Speed.</HI> But no other story mentions it, no not that of his life and acts written by (his successour) Archbishop <HI>Parker.</HI> But so they say. Take it as I finde it. When or by whom soever it was re|paired, it is plain by the Monk of <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> that in his time, which was about the yeare of grace 1142. in the reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> it was walled round. For he saith it was <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">De gest. Pontif. lib. 1. in Prologo.</NOTE> then a City much renowned (amongst other things) for the walls whole and undecayed enclosing it round about. Which being so, and no violence offered them afterward
<PB N="9" REF="17">
that we reade of, I marvell somewhat that there should be need of that fortification of the City with walls in <HI>Richard</HI> the first's time, as it seems there was: For the King being (it should appeare) taken prisoner in his return from the holy land, his Mother Q. <HI>Alianor,</HI> out of her care in her ab|sent sonnes behalfe, of this amongst other (as it seems) weak parts of the kingdome, takes order for the fortifying of it: as by her letters <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">In Archivis Ecclesiae <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE> of the following tenor may appeare, written (itseems) at the instance and for the securitie of the Cathedrall Monks, fearfull that this one act of their as|sistance in the work of the Cities fortification, might in|fringe their libertie of <HI>Burgbote,</HI> and being drawn <HI>in conse|quentiam</HI> become a prejudiciall example, effectuall to compell them to the like in future time, as of the nature of a leading case.</P>

<P>By this Record you may perceive that the whole Wall betweene Westgate and Northgate was not then built, as now we see it is. For on either side the River, the Wall, by this Record, clearely breakes off, so that there is an in|terjected distance of eighteene perches long betweene the one, and the other Wall. And indeed it will easily appeare to be but a slight observation; that so much of the Wall as stands and is made up in that then un-walled part, namely betweene the Posterne and the Waterlocke, next Northgate, through which in Arches, with a Portclose, the River now passeth from Abbots Mill, is in the stone|worke much different from the rest of the Wall, and shewes not in any part the least wracke or decay, as the other doth. It seemes then that Archbishop <HI>Sudbury</HI> built not all the long Wall.</P>
<P>But enough of the Wall, unlesse the City of latter time had more tendred her own credit and safety in keeping it better repaired. In pity and just reproofe whereof (whe|ther in this City, or any other) I crave leave here a little to enlarge my selfe. A Cities aspect is much blemished by ruinous edifices: especially publicke, and in places most obvious to the eye. Now what more publicke and obvious then the City Wall?

<P>In this Wall are to the number of twenty one Turrets, or small watch Towers orderly placed, the most of them (thankes to God) of no use now adayes; but in many mens judgements, such, as with no great cost, if it might stand with the wisdome of the City, might make, what we much want, convenient Pest-houses, and Recepta|cles for the poore visited people of the City, many times either indangering the publicke safety by their stay in their houses, or else hazarding their private well-fare abroad for want of such or like accomodation. I have done with the Walles.</P>

<HEAD>The Gates.</HEAD>
<P>The Gates of the City come next to be considered of. The Wall at this day admits of onely sixe (except the three Posternes) answering to the number of the Wards, Burgate, Newingate, Ridingate, Worthgate, Westgate, and Northgate. Anciently we had another, a seventh gate, which was called <HI>Queningate,</HI> whereof mention is made in the fore-going note of the measure|ment of the City Wall. I will briefely speake of them all, beginning with that whereof I finde eldest mention, Burgate, or Burrough-gate.</P>
<P>The first of King <HI>Ethelb.</HI> Charters dated in the yeare of our redemption 605. tels us of this Gate: bounding out <NOTE PLACE="marg">Burgate.</NOTE> the intended site of Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> Monastery, South to Burgate-way. <HI>In meridie via de Burgate,</HI> saith the Char|ter. It was afterwards, and still is otherwise called Saint <HI>Michaels-</HI>gate, from the Church so called sometime neighbouring to it. About the yeare of Grace 1475.

Besides tradition which retaines the memory of this com|mon way, the wills <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Penes Re|gistrum Consistor' Cantuar.</NOTE> of some of our Townesmen buried in S^t <HI>Augustines</HI> said Church-yard, make mention of it, by appointing and laying out their burials in <HI>Cimiterio S^t Au|gust' in alta via,</HI> and the like. And in, or about the begin|ning of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. reigne, I finde there arose a great debate, ending in a suite in law, betweene the City and the Abby concerning Limits; occasioned chiefely by the Citizens challenge, and the Monkes deniall of this way, to lye and be within the liberty and franchese of the City. The qua|rell happened in the time of the Bailiffes, who in their passage to and from S^t <HI>Martins</HI> by that way, with their Maces, the ensignes of their Magistracy borne up before them, so distasted the Monkes, that on a time meeting them and their company upon the place, and not prevai|ling with them <HI>verbis;</HI> or by force of argument to desert their, and the Cities claime in that behalfe: impatient of the affront, they attempted it <HI>vi,</HI> or by force of armes, endeavouring by strong hand to force them from the place, but being the weaker party, were put to the worst. To suit then they goe, but the issue what it was I cannot learne, onely I have seene (and have a Copy of) an argu|ment drawne and framed on the Monkes part, and in de|fence of their limits and liberties, to the doing whereof

<P>Newingate, otherwise from the Church so called stand|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Newingate.</NOTE> hard by it, S^t <HI>Georges-</HI>gate. This Gate was new built much about the time that Burgate was.

But it took not the name of New|ingate, that is Newgate, from this new building of it; but was much more anciently so called. For about the middle of the eleventh Century, in a Bull of Pope <HI>Alex.</HI> 3. to the Monkes of Christ-church, I read this; <HI>In civitate Cantuar. Ecclesiam scil.

walk from the lesser to the greater Dondgehill, and <HI>&egrave; con|tra,</HI> but it is decayed and gone. And so I walk on to Worth|gate.</P>
<P>Of which I can say but little, and the rather because I am not as yet perswaded to be of their opinion who think that Winchep-gate, that now is, and so called, is the anci|ent Worthgate. For my part, I rather conceive the gate now disgated sometime leading out of the Castle-yard in|to Winchep to be Worthgate, because it is both the more ancient gate in all appearance, carrying a shew of greater Antiquitie then the castle it self in the perfect Arch of British brick which it hath, not sampled of any other a|bout the City; and in its ruines retaines the <HI>vestigia</HI> of a gate, both for strength and beauty of good respect. Be|sides, by it the road is continued, directly from Castle-street into Winchep, and <HI>&egrave; contra:</HI> whereas Winchep-gate carries no shew of the least antiquitie; and beside stands wide of Winchep, making the passenger wheel a|bout, and fetch a compasse to come to it. Besides observe the name, which I suppose taken up and given it since the building of the Castle, Worthgate, that is (as I conceive) the Castle-gate, or gate by the Castle: Worth (as some interpretit <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Remaines of Surnames <HI>in verb. Worth. pag.</HI> 93.</NOTE>) signifying a Fort: or else VVorthgate, <HI>quasi</HI> VVard-gate, from the constant watch and ward (com|monly called Castle-guard:) anciently kept in the Castle and Barbican, for the safeguard of it and the City, where|of some ancient evidences have taken notice, as (amongst other) one of S. <HI>Radeg.</HI> Abbey <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Lib.

<P>But leaving this matter, let me tell you, that, accord|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">London <HI>rode.</HI></NOTE> to traditionall report, <HI>London</HI> rode lay anciently by this gate, untill <HI>Boughton</HI> way, as the more direct, came into request; which it did but lately as they say, how truly
<PB N="22" REF="24">
I know not, but not improbably, (if for no other reason) because of the prison kept of old first in the Castle, and af|terwards at or neare S. <HI>Iacobs</HI> (whereof more anon) pla|ces most likely of the greatest through-fare. But as a thing uncertaine I leave it with a <HI>Fides penes lectorem esto,</HI> untill further enquiry shall inable me to give him better satisfa|ction. But for certain, of old, in perilous times of hostilitie, all strangers coming by <HI>Dover,</HI> and those eastern coasts from forrein parts, being denied the common through|fare of the City, were put to seek <HI>London-</HI>rode, by a lane leading to it not farre distant from this Gate, of some cal|led Strangers way, of other Out-aliens way, which cros|seth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strangers way.</NOTE> the rode at S. <HI>Dunstans</HI> Crosse a little on this side of <HI>Cockering ferme.</HI> Of this Gate I have nothing more to say in this place, because I shall have a second occasion for it, when I come to the Castle. I passe therefore from it to VVestgate.</P>
<P>But first will it please you to heare my second thoughts, touching the rodes lying by this Gate, to and from <HI>Lon|don?</HI></P>
<P>Some haply will more readily adhere to this opinion, because M^r <HI>Cambden</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Britannia <HI>in</HI> Kent.</NOTE> seems to be in a manner of their minde, by making <HI>Lenham</HI> (in his interpretation) the same with the Emperour <HI>Antoninus</HI> his <HI>Durolsuum</HI> men|tioned in his <HI>Itinerary,</HI> as one of the mansions or stations upon the rode lying in his time between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Rich|borough.</HI></P>
<P>But therein (I take it) M^r <HI>Cambden</HI> is mistaken, If you <NOTE PLACE="marg">M^r <HI>Cambdens</HI> opinion tou|ching <HI>Lenham</HI> examination.</NOTE> will heare my reasons, first let me give you the Stations or Mansions which the <HI>Itinerary</HI> mentions lying in the rode between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Richborough,</HI> with the distances be|tween the stages, and the totall summe or number of miles in the whole journey, taking beginning from <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>Now the first of these stages betweene <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Richborough (Noviomagus) M^r Cambden</HI> conceiveth to be that which is now called <HI>Woodcote,</HI> a little village neare <HI>Croydon</HI> in <HI>Surrey.</HI> The next <HI>(Vagniac.)</HI> he takes for <HI>Maid|stone,</HI> a Towne well knowne in <HI>Kent.</HI> The third <HI>(Durobro|vis)</HI> for <HI>Rochester</HI> City.

<P>As for the third and two last of these stages, there is no cause of doubt (as I conceive) but he hits them aright: the <HI>Quaere</HI> rests then onely upon the other three. Now it will, I thinke, be easily granted that the Roman-roads betweene Port and Port; and betweene one great Towne and another, were made and laid out as direct and streight

as might be <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Hae viae sum|ma rectitudi|ne tanquam pro|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nsa linea, per quaecunque lo|corum incommo|da, tanta latitu|dine ductae sunt.

And that the rode or Port-way betweene <HI>London</HI> and these Port-Townes was streight and without much winding, appeareth plainely by the totall of the miles, not onely betweene them (e|specially betweene <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dover</HI> being reckoned but at 66. a distance which it holds almost to this day, though the English be longer then the Italian miles:) but also, if you marke it betweene <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Rochester,</HI> and between <HI>Rochester</HI> also and <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the former being 27. the latter 25. If this be so, the Traveller goes much awry and out of his way, that setting out of <HI>London,</HI> and bound for <HI>Richborough,</HI> goes first eight or ten miles wide of <HI>London,</HI> to <HI>Woodcote:</HI> from thence to <HI>Maidstone</HI> some 24. miles a|sunder: and from <HI>Maidstone</HI> makes to <HI>Rochester</HI> (oblique|ly all the way, without gaining a step nearer his journeys end, when he is there: and then quatering againe re|turnes into <HI>Maidstone</HI> rode, and salutes <HI>Lenham,</HI> and so makes forward. He that takes his way thus shall finde it little lesse thrn 80. of our miles betweene <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Rich|borough.</HI></P>
<P>The case thus standing, suffer me to give my weake conjecture how the Rode might lye in the Romans time; and to tell you whereabout I guesse these Stations, Man|sions or stages that the <HI>Itinerary</HI> speakes of, were severally seated, and may now probably be found.</P>
<P>As for the first then, being <HI>Noiomagus,</HI> or <HI>Noviomagus,</HI> and that seated tenne miles from <HI>London;</HI> I cannot con|ceive <NOTE PLACE="marg">Noviomagus.</NOTE> how it should be a stage for this rode, and lye wide of <HI>London,</HI> as <HI>Woodcote</HI> doth, so many miles, and consequent|ly set the Traveller at as great a distance from the place whither he is bound <HI>(Richborough)</HI> as when he first set out
<PB N="25" REF="25">
of <HI>London.</HI> Considering this, and the distance betweene <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Rochester,</HI> by the <HI>Itinerary,</HI> I should rather place it about <HI>Crayford,</HI> much about tenne miles from <HI>London,</HI> upon or alongst some Hill or Downe, since it is otherwise called <HI>Noviodunum.</HI></P>

<P>And now in <HI>callem regredior,</HI> hoping this digression is neither in point of Antiquity impertinent, nor in point of method preposterous, being ushered in by so fit an oc|casion. Our forefathers, whose wits the frequency of in|vasion prompted to all manner of warlike invention, used to secure their City-gates against assailants, not onely with a Port-close to let downe before it, but also with a warlike device built over it, through which they could let downe any offensive thing against the enemy approch|ing to assaile it. A Gate so fortified was called <HI>Porta ma|checollata,</HI> from <HI>machecollare,</HI> or <HI>machecoulare,</HI> which (saith my Auther <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Coke <HI>upon</HI> Litt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on. lib. 1. cap. 1. Sect. 1. pag 5.</NOTE>) is to make a warlike device over a Gate or other passage like to a Grate, through which scalding water, or ponderous or offensive things may be cast upon the assailants. Thus he. After this manner were and are our two principall Gates built, this of Westgate, and in imi|tation thereof that of Newingate, with each of them a Port-close, like as Burgate: now to Northgate.</P>
<P>This Gate stands under apart of Saint <HI>Maries</HI> Church, <NOTE PLACE="marg">N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gate.</NOTE> which is built over it upon the Wall, and to distinguish it from the other <HI>Maries</HI> of the City, hath this addition from the situation (of Northgate). Under the Quire or Chan|cell whereof is a Vault, with an open space or lope-hole in the Wall fashioned like a Crosse. It was sometime an Hermitage, but is now belonging to the Parsonage.</P>
<P>Come we now to <HI>Queningate.</HI> But where shall we seeke it? Thereis none of the name at this day, and few know <NOTE PLACE="marg">Queningate.</NOTE> where it stood. I sought as narrowly for it as for Ants|paths, and at length having found it will shew you where it was. It stood against the Priory of Christ Church, saith
<PB N="30" REF="29">
our Wall-measurer, distanced from Northgate (saith he) 69. perches, but saith an Elder record of Christ Church, 71. perches. By these descriptions it must needs have stood neare the place of the now Posterne-gate, against S^t <HI>Augustines.</HI> And indeed a remanent of British brickes laid and couched Arch-wise at a place in the Wall, a little North-ward of the Posterne, showes the very place. A small Gate it was <HI>(Parva porta de Queningate,</HI> saith <HI>Ickham;)</HI> but I will assure you a very ancient one, as not onely the Bricks-betoken, but the records of Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> prove it, which tell that one <HI>Domwaldus</HI> (as I told you on a for|mer occasion) gave to that Abby certaine land within Queningate. The very name hath antiquity in it, signify|ing the King or Queenes gate, being haply <HI>Ethelbert</HI> and his Queene <HI>Bertha</HI> their passage from their Palace neare adjoyning to the severall places of their divers devotions: the one (if <HI>Thorne</HI> say true) at Saint <HI>Pancrace</HI> (so after|wards called;) the other at Saint <HI>Martin,</HI> whereof more hereafter <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>In</HI> S.

<P>Where the Church or Chappell stood, that had it name from this Gate, being called Saint <HI>Mary</HI> of Queningate, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^t. Mary</HI> of Queningate Church.</NOTE> I cannot well tell. That such a Church it had, is most cer|taine. I trace it in many records (some 450 yeares old and more) of Christ-Church, which had the Patronage of that and Saint <HI>Michael</HI> of Burgate, confirmed to them in and by a Bull of Pope <HI>Alex.</HI> 3. and in many like Buls since. The Parson thereof in the yeare 1381. as those re|cords informe me, made an exchange of it and Burgate to which it was an annexed Chap. for <HI>Portpole</HI> Chantery in <HI>Pauls.</HI> This being certaine, it is no lesse sure that it stood not farre from the Gate, by the name of it; yet not very neare, it is like, because the bounders of the City-Wall and ground under it, betweene Northgate and Quenin|gate, and betweene it and Burgate, granted to Christ-Church, neither of them mention it: and <HI>Ickhams</HI>

And so I have done with both Wall and Gates, and come now unto (my next Particular) the Ci|ty-Ditch. Only let me but name unto you the Posternes, which (as erewhile I told you) were three.

<P>Of what antiquity this Ditch is (I confesse) I cannot well tell. In the Survey of our City in <HI>Doomsday</HI> Booke, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ditch about the City how ancient.</NOTE> I meet with <HI>Fossatum Civitatis,</HI> but in what sense I doe not well know. For whether the City-Ditch be there inten|ded, or some siege rather or beleaguering of the City (for that sense the word <HI>Fossatum</HI> also carries:) it is to me some question. Eleven of those Burgeses (saith <HI>Doomsday)</HI> that were in <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the Confessors time, <HI>Vastati sunt in Fossato Civitatis.</HI> If it had beene said eleven Burgeses houses or mansions were so laid wast, it had beene some|what plaine. It might have beene supposed their Vasta|tion had beene to make way for the Ditch. But you see what the words are. Either there is a figure in them, or the Ditch is not so old. If so old, neglected afterwards. For Queene <HI>Alianor's</HI> letters before presented, speake of fortifying the City, not onely <HI>muris,</HI> but <HI>fossatis</HI> too, as in want of both.</P>
<P>This our Ditch (it seemes) was originally of a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Breadth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Ditch.</NOTE> breadth, 150. foot over, as I find by the records of a suite commenced by the City against Archbishop <HI>Peckham,</HI> in the reigne of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. the 18. yeare, who charging upon the Archbishop (but erroneously, the Jury finding it not his, but his Tenents fact) for incroching upon the City-ditch, and streightning of it with houses built upon it a|bout Westgate, to the Cities great damage and annoy|ance, in regard that the River running through that part

This River we call <HI>Stoure,</HI> as did our Ancestors long ages. <HI>Inter gemi|nales Rivos fluminis quod dicitur Stour,</HI> are the words of a <HI>Codicill</HI> or <HI>Landboc</HI> of King <HI>Cenulph</HI> the Mercian made to the Archbishop, and his Monkes of Christ-Church, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 814 <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">In archivis Ec|cles. <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE>. Long before this, a Charter of <HI>Edric</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> in <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 686. made to the Abby of Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> giving certaine land in <HI>Stodmersh,</HI> mentioneth this River, bounding out the same to lye one way to a place called Ford-street, and on the other part to have <HI>Flumen quod nominatur Stur</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thorne</HI> In vitis Abb. S. Aug.</NOTE>. And yet more anciently oc|curres the name. For <HI>Sturrey</HI> which takes it name from this River running by it, is by that name together with <HI>Chiste|let,</HI> granted by King <HI>Ethelbert</HI> himselfe (his Charter tels me so) to S^t <HI>Augustine.</HI></P>
<P>What the name signifies, or whence it was taken, certain|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">River when<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e called <HI>Stour.</HI></NOTE> I know not. Haply from the constant and continuall stirring and swift course or motion of it, to difference it from standing waters, whence probably the Britain name of the City, Durwhern. i. a swift river, or else from Store, for the plenty of water, and the many streames falling into it: as the river <HI>Stura,</HI> arising in the Alpes, one of the 30. which of the river <HI>Po</HI> are carried into the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, whereof <HI>Plinie</HI> speaks, <HI>lib. 3. c.</HI> 16. is vulgarly called <HI>Store.</HI> Certes <HI>Stour</HI> is a name taken up, and given it since the Britains time. For <HI>Dur</HI> or <HI>Dour</HI> was with them the common name for all waters <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cambd.</HI> Britannia.

For the sourse and course of this river I referre you to <HI>Hollinshead</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Chronicle <HI>fol</HI> 20.</NOTE> &amp; <HI>Lambert</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rambul. of <HI>Kent.</HI></NOTE>, who will copiously herein give you satisfaction. Commoditie hath ever her opposites atten|dance. The great commoditie and conveniency of our Ci|ties plantation by this river is attended by and with the dis|commoditie and annoyance of inundation. But our Ance|stors, the Cities first <HI>Incolae,</HI> weighed not the inconvenience of the one, for the benefit and accommodation of the other. And it is an inconvenience in these dayes scarcely considerable, because seldome happening; or that can hap|pen in regard the City lies higher now then at thefirst, having in all parts of itbeen much raised at severall times, as cellar-diggers, and such like, who are much hindred in their work by old foundations which they meet with in their digging, daily finde: occasioned (as I conceive) by the many vastations of the City in the Danes time, and lastly about the yeare of our Lord 1160. by casuall fire.</P>
<P>The greatest channell of this our river, ran anciently through the middest of the City, to the Kings-mill. For I finde Archbishop <HI>Pickham</HI> charged by the Citizens with the diverting of it, by certain cuts or trenches, for the bet|tering of his mill at Westgate: which the Jury found to have been done before partly in Archb. <HI>Kilwarby,</HI> and partly in Archb. <HI>Boniface</HI> times <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Liber Camerae Civitatis.</NOTE>. The channell to Westgate then (it seems) became inlarged. But the first division of the stream was not then made. For, that <HI>Stour</HI> had it course that way much more anciently then those times, is most cleare. For I finde it to give name in the Conq. time, to the Archbishops Mannor, since and at this day called Westgate (from the situation of it neare that gate:) but then, from the standing of it by the <HI>Stour-</HI>side, <HI>Stour-seat,</HI> the seat by the <HI>Stour;</HI> as that other part of her divided chan|nell gave name to the street it runs by, called to this day Stourstree, that is, the street by or nigh the <HI>Stour.</HI></P>
<P>The accommodation of the City by the scowring and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Projects for the Rivers in|largement hi|therto fru|strate.</NOTE> inlargement of this river hath been a thing at severall times attempted, but <HI>sine fructu,</HI> or without successe worthy the

<P>Execution, which is said to be the life of laws, was wanting here. This law, this Statute-law (it seems) was never so inlivened.

<P>These auspicious beginnings had answerable proceed|ings. For the foundation of the Abbey thus laid, it be|came in processe of time much advanced, both in the in|largement of her buildings, and augmentations of her in|dowment. For the first. After the death of King <HI>Ethelb. Eadbaldus</HI> (his sonne) at the instance of <HI>Lawrence</HI> the Archb' builded a faire Church in this Monastery which he
<PB N="53" REF="45">
called <HI>S. Maries.</HI> After <HI>Eadbaldus,</HI> King <HI>Canute</HI> (the great Monarch of this Realme:) <HI>Egelsine</HI> (the Abbat that fled for feare of the Conquerour:) <HI>Scotlandus</HI> (whom the same King put in <HI>Egelsin's</HI> place:) <HI>Hugh Floriac</HI> (that was of kin|dred to King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> and by him made Abbat:) were the persons that chiefly increased the building: some bestowing Churches and Chapels; some Dortors and Re|fectories or dining places, and others other sort of edi|fices <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Lamb. <HI>per|amb. of</HI> Kent <HI>in</HI> Canterbury.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now for the latter, her increase in possessions and indow|ment, it would be too tedious a matter to particularize but the one halfe of the donations and grants of lands and re|venues that were made and given by the multitude of be|nefactors of all sorts, who out of the heat of their devotion to the place, for the double founders sake, the one the great instrument of Christianisme brought and wrought amongst the Saxon people of those parts, the other (by Gods bles|sing on his endeavours) the first Christian King of the English-Saxon race, strived of holy zeal, according to their knowledge to out-strip one another in an open handed li|beralitie to this Abbey. The Royall benefactors (for I shall <NOTE PLACE="marg">Royall bene|factours to S. <HI>Augustine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Abbey.</NOTE> omit the rest) after <HI>Ethelb.</HI> (as <HI>Thorne</HI> informs me) were chiefly these. King <HI>Eadbald</HI> his sonne and next Successor, who gave the mannor of <HI>Northborne,</HI> consisting of 30 plough-lands. King <HI>Lothaire,</HI> who gave 3 plough-lands in <HI>Stodmersh.</HI> King <HI>Withred,</HI> who gave the mannor of <HI>Littleborne</HI> of 5 plough-lands. King <HI>Eadbert</HI> his sonne, who gave 6 plough-lands in <HI>Little-Mongeham.</HI> King <HI>Edmund,</HI> whose gift was 2 plough lands in <HI>Sybertsweld. Kenewulf</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> and <HI>Cuthred</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> who gave the mannor of <HI>Lenham,</HI> consisting of 20 plough-lands and 13 Denes. King <HI>Ethel|wulf</HI> the West-Saxon, who gave 40 Caslatos (Mansions I take it) in <HI>Lenham.</HI> King <HI>Ethelhert</HI> the West-Saxon also, who gave the mannor of <HI>Merton</HI> in East <HI>Kent,</HI> of 3 plough-lands. King <HI>Canute,</HI> who together with the body S. <HI>Mildred</HI> the virgin of <HI>Thanet,</HI> gave unto the Abbey all the indow|ment of that late Monastery. King <HI>Edgar</HI> who gave <HI>Plum|sted,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="46">
of 4 plough lands. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, who gave all the land he had in <HI>Fordwich.</HI></P>
<P>The succeeding Kings, for the most part, were rather confirmers or restorers of the old, then contributers of new possessions to this Abbey. Whose Charters (as the o|thers) are many of them already published partly in <HI>Reyner's Apostolatus Benedictinorum,</HI> and partly in <HI>Wevers</HI> Funerall Monuments. Wherefore I spare their recitall here. Nei|ther will I wade or enter farre into discourse of the once flourishing estate of this ancient Abbey, lest I finde it (as I may justly feare it) even endlesse. For so many were the priviledges, so wide the possessions, and so very great the estimation of this Abbey, in many respects (that of it being, of old, the selected place for the Royall and Archiepisco|pall sepulture, not the least:) as few other in the King|dome did or could in all points paralell it.</P>
<P>Onely let me, ere my cloze, acquaint you from M^r <HI>Lam|bert</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Peramb. of <HI>Kent.</HI> in <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE>, that the house, before the dissolution, had five Co|vents, consisting (saith he) of 65 Monks, Benedictines, or of the order of the Black monks of S. <HI>Benet,</HI> which began here in England with their Founder, (the nature hereof see hereafter in Christ-Church:) And, as he addes (beside Juris|diction over an whole lath of 13 hundreds) it had possession of livelihood to the value of 808. <HI>l'</HI> by yeare. Herein, (I sup|pose) following the estimate of her temporalties, taxed at that summe by the Popes Delegates, the Bishops of <HI>Winche|ster</HI> and <HI>Lincoln, Iohn</HI> and <HI>Oliver,</HI> in the yeare 1292. authori|sed to tax and rate the temporalties of all the Clergy both religious and secular throughout the Kingdome, for the levying of a tenth thereby, which the Pope had granted to the King <HI>(Ed. 1.) in subsidium terrae sanctae.</HI> But it seems <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Lib. Eccles. Christi Cant.</NOTE> that upon the surrender and suppression of the Abby, which happened 4. <HI>Decemb. 29. Hen</HI> 8. that estimate was well neare doubled.

and <HI>Wever's</HI> ancient Funerall monuments. And hitherto of the flourishing estate of this Abbey.</P>
<P>It neither may, nor will (I know) be imagined but that this Abbey tasted of both fortunes. Wherefore as you have heard somewhat of the weale, so now give me leave with what brevitie I can, to acquaint also with the wo; the detri|ments I mean and dysasters, that have at any time abated, and at last fatally obscured and finally extinguished the glo|ry and Majesty of this once famous and opulent Abbey.</P>
<P>Whereof the first in time and not of least regard was her losse of the long enjoyed right and interest to the burialls of the Kings and Archbishops, of which, the former, in Archbishop <HI>Brightwald's,</HI> and the latter in <HI>Cutbert's</HI> dayes were first taken from it <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Lamb. <HI>Per|amb. of</HI> Kent <HI>in</HI> Canterbury.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another was the grievous and frequent infestation of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abby infected by the Danes.</NOTE> the place by the Danes: which (however their Chroni|clers, for their Abbeys greater glory, sometimes ascribe their safety, defence and deliverance from those Invaders to a miraculous preservation:) yet doubtlesse either suffer|ed their violence, or at the least, and at the best, purchased their peace (and so prevented their greater calamity) at a deare rate, and with costly redemptions, especially in that lamentable spoil and devastation of the City under King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> in the yeare 1011. The recorders of the tragi|call story whereof, the elder Monks, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington, Roger Hoveden,</HI> and others, (whose pens a miracle so mainly tending to the advancement of Monkery, in all likelihood could not have escaped) tell of no such miracle as <HI>Thorne</HI> will have the Abbey then rescued and saved by, which was, that when a Dane had taken hold of S. <HI>Augustines</HI> pall or cloak (wherewith his tombe was covered) it stuck so fast to his fingers, that by no means possible he could lose it, till he came and yeelded himself to the Monks, and made sor|rowfull confession of his fault. Which thing so terrified the rest of the Danes, that they desisted and ceased from inva|ding the Monastery, and became chief protectors and de|fenders of it. <HI>Cum Dani</HI> (as <HI>Thornes</HI> own words are) <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tu|ariam

Quae ultio ita caeterorum Danorum multitudinem terruit, ut hujus Monasterii non sol&ugrave;m fieri time|rent invasores, sed magis ejus praecipui forent defensores.</HI> Thus he. But (as I said) our elder stories have no mention of this miracle. <HI>Hoveden</HI> (I confesse) naming the then Ab|bat of the place, sayes that he was suffered to escape or go his way, haply (&amp; as it may be reasonably thought) because he had ransomed himself and his Abbey, by composition with the enemy. But that your belief may not rest upon my bare and singular opinion of this Abbeys partaking with the neighbour City, and Cathedrall in their Danish pres|sures, I will stand by, whilest Reverend Archbishop <HI>Parker</HI> gives you his, who thinking it incredible that the Citie should so often suffer, by the Danes, and this Abbey escape, thus expostulates the matter. <HI>Quid dicam</HI> (saith he) <HI>de Monasterio Sancti Augustini, Doroberniae, omnium primo &amp; an|tiquissimo, Romanorum Pontificum, atque Regum Cantiorum pri|vilegiis adeo superbo, quibus fretus ab omni subjectione &amp; obe|dientia sui Archipraesulis, immune se putarit? &amp;c.

<P>The next great crosse which befell this Abbey, but com|mon to it with other, was the restraint of the Laitie from any longer extending the hand of their bounty, in passing over their fee to the Abbey, without speciall licence of the King, by the Stat. of <HI>Mortmaine,</HI> or the law of <HI>Amortization;</HI> which timely to moderate the before unlimited libertie of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.

But this crosse, this losse, was in part sup|plied and made lesse sensible unto the religious, by a piece of policie which they quickly put in ure, and that was the procuring not onely of priviledges and immunities from payment of tithes, but also of Impropriations or Annexions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Impropriati|ons.</NOTE> of Churches, Parsonages I mean, to their houses; which though invented, and on foot long before, upon what pre|text see <HI>Hay</HI> in his <HI>Astrum inextinctum. quaest. 2. num 9. &amp; seq. fol.</HI> 98. 99. yet now, the other current of their gain being

The sept or site of the Mona|stery yet appeares and may be traced by the circuiting walls, within the compasse whereof the Elemosinary, by the Court-gate (a place where the almes of the Abbey, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Almnery.</NOTE> remaines of their food being sent thither, were distributed as a main part of their subsistence, to certain almes-people consisting of a society of Brothers and Sisters, having had a Chapell to it now desolate, and rotting in it own ruines) was included long ago, as it seems by a Composition <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Liber Eccles. Christi Cant.</NOTE>, in the yeare 1237. (foure hundred yeares ago) made between the then Archbishop and his Archdeacon of the one part, and the then Abbat, of the other: (amongst other things) touching Jurisdiction, and right to the coertion of crimi|nous persons of the Monastery delinquent in the Diocesse of <HI>Cant. extra septa sui Monasterii, quae continent elemosinari|am extra portam eorum,</HI> as the composition wordeth it. <HI>Hugh</HI> the Abbat, of that name the second, when he divided and distinguished the offices of his Monastery <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thorne</HI> in ejus vita.</NOTE>, assigned the Church or Parsonage of <HI>Northborne,</HI> with the Chapells an|nexed to this Almnery.</P>
<P>Now enter we the sept, where the first thing in our eye <NOTE PLACE="marg">Refectory.</NOTE>
<PB N="61" REF="49">
observable (except the faire Hall, the late Refectory of the Monkes) is <HI>Ethelb.</HI> Tower. Not so called (as vulgar <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ethelberts</HI> Tower.</NOTE> tradition will fabulously tell you it was) from the building of it, either by him, or by others in his time. In honor and memory of him I will grant it was, but yet long since his dayes, being not built (I take it) untill about the yeare 1047. For (as it is in the private Chronicler, <HI>Thorne)</HI> the then Archbishop <HI>Eadsin,</HI> beside some other acts of his bounty to the Abbey, gave 100. markes, <HI>ad turris aedifica|tionem, quae tunc fuerat in construendo,</HI> meaning this Tower, as I conceive. Other certainty of the age of it, I cannot give, and so leave it with the words of <HI>Speed</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Hist. pag. 294.</NOTE>, who in the close of his discourse touching this Abbey, thus speakes of it. Onely <HI>Ethelberts</HI> Tower (saith he) in memory and ho|nour of the man, as yet hath escaped the verdict and sen|tence of destruction, whose beauty, though much defaced and overworne, will witnesse to succeeding Ages the mag|nificence of the whole, when all stood compleate in their glory together.</P>
<P>The next thing (and what else onely is observable a|mongst <NOTE PLACE="marg">S^t <HI>Pancrace</HI> Chapell.</NOTE> these heapes of ruines) is the Chapell of S^t <HI>Pan|crace,</HI> built (as the private Chronicler makes report) be|fore <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorne.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine</HI> came; and used by the King, before his con|version to Christianity, for the place of his Idol-worship, but after it, the first that <HI>Augustine,</HI> after he had purged it from the worship of the false, consecrated to the service of the true God, and dedicated to S^t <HI>Pancrace.</HI> Wherewith the devill all inraged, and not brooking his ejection from the place he had so long enjoyed; the first time that <HI>Augustine</HI> celebrates masse there, furiously assaults the Chapell to overturne it. But having more of will then power to actu|ate his intended mischiefe, all he could doe was to leave the ensignes of his malice, the prints of his talons on the South-Porch-Wall of the Chapell, where they are visible to this day. Thus <HI>Thorne</HI> tels the tale. And no better then a tale can I conceive it to be. I will grant that a Chappell of that name, of no small antiquity there was sometime
<PB N="62" REF="50">
standing, where a good part of her ruines are yet left, built almost wholly of British or Romane bricke (infallible Re|maines of antiquity:) That on the Walls out-side of the South-Porch, such tokens as the Historian will have to be the markes of the Beast, are visible enough: That of latter time this Story became vulgarly received. <HI>(Hamon Beale,</HI> to instance in one for many, <HI>Anno</HI> 1492. gives by his Will <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Penes Regi|strum Domini Archid. Cant.</NOTE> to the reparation of S^t <HI>Pancrace</HI> his Chapell within the precinct of S^t <HI>Augustines</HI> Church-yard, and of the Chapell where S^t <HI>Augustine</HI> first celebrated masse in <HI>England,</HI> an|nexed to the former, 3^l. 6^s. 8^d.) But that either this was the place, where Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> first said masse in <HI>England</HI> (S^t <HI>Martins</HI> was it, as <HI>Bede</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastic. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 26.</NOTE> will tell you:) or that the story is further true then I have granted, I cannot beleeve.</P>
<P>To give you my reasons. Consult venerable <HI>Bede's</HI> pre|face to his Ecclesiasticall Story, and you shall finde he there acknowledgeth his intelligence for these parts received chiefely from <HI>Albinus</HI> the then Abbat of S^t <HI>August.</HI> who with diligence instructed him in all things that either by written record, or tradition of his Elders, had come unto his knowledge, any way memorable. But take his owne words. <HI>Auctor ante omnes</HI> (saith he) <HI>atque adjutor opusculi hu|jus Albinus Abbas reverendissimus, vir per omnia doctissimus, extitit. Qui in ecclesia Cantuariorum &agrave; beatae memoriae Theodoro Archiepiscopo &amp; Hadriano Abbate viris venerabilibus at erudi|tissimis institutus, diligenter omnia quae in ipsa Cantuariorum provincia, vel etiam in contiguis ejusdem regionibus &agrave; discipulis beati Papae Gregorii gesta fuere, vel monumentis litterarum, vel seniorum traditione cognoverat, &amp; ea mihi de his quae memoria digna videbantur per religiosum Londoniensis Ecclesiae presby|terum Nothelmum, sive litteris mandata sive ipsius Nothelmi viva voce referendo, transmisit.</HI> Thus <HI>Bede.</HI> Adde hereunto that this was a matter so remarkable, an occurrence, so much in itselfe, but in respect of the circumstances of time and place, much more memorable. Of time: It happening so in the very infancy of the English-Saxon Christian Church. Of place: Being such as from an Idol temple
<PB N="63" REF="50">
was become, and that but newly a Christian Oratory, that, then it, there is not a thing more worthy to be kept in me|mory in the whole story of the times: and therefore could not have escaped the one, the intelligencers <HI>(Albine's)</HI> knowledge, nor consequently the other, the Historian <HI>(Bede's)</HI> pen. But, for all this, looke and you shall finde, that <HI>Bede</HI> is so farre from making mention of it, that he remembers not so much as the Chapell. This is much. But let me adde yet further. The following Chronologers, for the most part Monkes all, passe it over in deepe silence. Could fame have beene (thinke you) so sluggish, or so con|fin'd, that so famous a matter as this should fall from no Authors pen till (in comparison) but yesterday, till <HI>Spott</HI> and <HI>Thornes</HI> dayes? The case so standing for me, <HI>credat Iu|deus apella.</HI> And so I leave it.</P>
<P>Now being upon taking our leave of the Abbey, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Church yard.</NOTE> making our retraict, let me lead you (as the next way out) over the forgotten Sepulchres of the dead; the ancient Cimitery ground of the Abbey, and so out at the gate be|fore Burgate. Which great and faire Gate, with a battle|ment, and that warlike invention of machicollation, called <HI>Porta occidentalis Cimiterii S</HI>^t <HI>Augustini</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Sic in Compo|sitione inter Abbatiam &amp; Civitatem, de qua pag. 275.</NOTE>, heretofore lead from Church-street (for so the street before it hath usually beene called) into S^t <HI>Augustines</HI> Church-yard. A buriall place not private and proper onely to the Abbey, nor only free to the choice of any that desired buriall there; but with all untill the Dissolution, the proper and onely Cimi|tery belonging unto divers Parish-Chuches of the City, destitute of such Dormitories of their owne, of which the Abbey had the patronage: such as were S^t <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> S^t <HI>Andrew,</HI> and (as I verily beleeve) S^t <HI>Paul</HI> too; however because of late some question hath beene made of it, I will not contend. But what if it shall appeare, that for more then 100. yeares together, next before the Dissolution of the Abbey, not one of the many testators of those Pari|shes have once mentioned any Church-yard of their owne, either in appointment of it for the place of their buriall (as
<PB N="64" REF="51">
in other parishes that had Church-yards it was usuall to doe) or otherwise; though of their Churches often? That scores, if not hundreds of them have from time to time pitched on this common Cimitery of S^t <HI>Augustine</HI> for the place and purpose afore-said? that after the Dissolution, and that Cimitery withdrawne and taken from them, not yet a testator of succeeding times wills to be laid in any Church-yard of their owne; but, as now to seeke of a resting place for their bodies after death peculiar to them, betake them|selves for buriall to the Church-yards of Neighbour-Pari|shes? That as the situation of two of these Parish-Chur|ches will not admit of any adjoyning Churchyard: the one, like <HI>Fan-</HI>Church in <HI>London,</HI> standing in the middest of the street, the other in a throng of contiguous houses; so the the third needed none in regard of the neerenesse of it to this Churchyard of the Abby, which in right &amp; title (I take it) of foundation, had the patronage of it? That it was the knowne Monkish policy, for the gaine sake, to draw all the burials they could to their Abbey, and for that end proba|bly <NOTE PLACE="marg">A piece of Monkish po|licy.</NOTE> at the Churches foundation, wittingly debarred the people of a Churchyard, to their Church: and lastly that this Abbey and Cimitery was built and set a part for a buriall of old, when as yet it was not lawfull to bury in Cities. If these things (I say) shall be made appeare and proved, as they easily may, what judicious and indifferent man then will conceive, against the strength of so much probability and presumption to the contrary, that these Churches had their proper Cimiteries adjoyning to them, however there may be some who (in confidence of not being gainesaid, because of their somewhat extraordinary age) shall say they had? But <HI>videant quorum interest.</HI> And so I leave this Abbey.</P>
<P>The next thing after this Abbey, in the Suburbs, which I shall servey, is the Church of S^t <HI>Martin,</HI> much celebrated <NOTE PLACE="marg">S^t Martin.</NOTE> both for the great antiquity of it, and also for the resort of <HI>Augustine</HI> and his fellow-labourers thither to their devoti|ons at their first arivall <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bede</HI> Eccles. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 25.</NOTE>, by the licence of King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI>

imparted to them in favour of Queene <HI>Berta</HI> his wife (a Christian, and descended of Christian parentage, being the daughter of <HI>Chilperike</HI> King of <HI>France)</HI> to whom this Church built long before, to wit (as <HI>Bede</HI> saith) by the Ro|mans, as some say in King <HI>Lucius</HI> dayes <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Vide Britan|niar. Ecclesiar. Antiquitates. cap. 6. pag. 130.</NOTE>, and dedicated to S^t <HI>Martin,</HI> was permitted for the place of her publicke devotions. The Church indeed seemes very ancient, be|ing built (the Chancell especially) mostly of British or Romane bricke, the noted reliques and tokens of old Age in any kinde of building whether sacred or profane.</P>
<P>At this place afterwards. i. from Archbishop <HI>Theodores</HI> untill <HI>Lanfranc's</HI> time by the space to wit of 349. yeares, there was a Bishops See <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ms. in Archi|vis Eccles Chri|sti Cant.</NOTE>, who alwayes remaining in the Country, supplyed the absence of the Archbishop, that for the most part followed the Court: and that as well in go|verning the Monkes, as in the performing the solemnities of the Church, and exercising the authority of an Arch|deacon. So <HI>Lambert</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Peramb. of <HI>Kent</HI> in <HI>Cant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">b.</HI></NOTE>. But the Chaire happening voyde in <HI>Lanfranc's</HI> time: he whether because that two Bishops were too many for one City (the very reason which as some say, he gave for what he did) or by colour of that ordi|nance of the Councell of <HI>London</HI> holden <HI>An.</HI> 1075 <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">De qua vide <HI>Malmesbur.</HI> de g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">st. po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t. lib. 1. pag. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</NOTE>. requi|ring the remove of Bishops Sees from obscure rurall villa|ges to Cities, or for that this B^p. was a <HI>Chorepiscopus,</HI> a kinde of Country <HI>Suffragan,</HI> an order (he well knew, no doubt) for just reasons, abolished abroad <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Canon Chorepis|copi. 68. distinct.</NOTE>: or for what other cause it is not certaine.

Neverthelesse, because he needed the helpe of a Substitute, he created in his place and stead, one of his Chaplaines, Archdeacon of <HI>Canterbury</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert</HI> ubi supra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. time, to wit in the yeare 1321. the Parson of this Church, and the Master of the Free-Schoole of the City fell at odds about the rights and priviledges of their severall Schooles: the Parson aforesaid, in right of this Church, and by concurrent Custome, challenging a liber|ty to the keeping of a Free-Schoole there, which the other would not admit of, but with a limitation of the number
<PB N="66" REF="52">
of his Scholars; of which more hereafter when I come to Christ-Church, within the moderne precinct whereof the City Free-Schoole (as I shall there show) was kept. And so I leave S^t <HI>Martins.</HI> Onely I wish that for the venerable an|tiquity of the Church, and sometime Espicopall estate of the place, things that have much dignified both, it might better flourish in the maintenance of its due rights and re|spects then I heare it doth.</P>
<P>My Progresse next invites you to (my Lord-cheife-Iu|stice <HI>Finch</HI> his Seate or Mansion house) the <HI>Mote.</HI> So called <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mote.</NOTE> now and of latter time; but formerly, and that of old, <HI>Wyke:</HI> deriving it name, either from that neighbour <HI>Wic,</HI> or <HI>Vicus,</HI> called <HI>Fordwik,</HI> upon which it borders at that place (I take it) which in the second of King <HI>Ethelberts</HI> Charters is called <HI>Wykingsmerke.</HI> Or else being named <NOTE PLACE="marg">Verstegan.</NOTE> <HI>Wyk,</HI> because (as the word imports) it hath sometimes beene a place of refuge or retreat, as it were a hold or for|tresse in some time of hostility: a derivation not improba|ble nor improper, if we adde and take this along with us, that there is a hill hard by it in the same Charter of <HI>Ethel|bert,</HI> called <HI>Sibben-</HI>downe. i.

<P>It had much other revenewes, as appeares by the Inven|tory thereof taken and presented to the Commissioners authorised to examine such matters by the Stat. 37. <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 4. Amongst the which, one, both of the principall and first, was the Ferme in the Parishes of <HI>Hakynton</HI> and <HI>Blean,</HI> for <HI>Firmin's Barton</HI> (as the fore-cited Inventory cals it) vulgarly miscalled <HI>Infirme-Barton,</HI> and of some, miscon|ceived to have appertained to Saint <HI>Augustine.</HI> Probably so named from that M^r <HI>Firmin</HI> or <HI>Feramin,</HI> the <HI>quondam</HI> Master of that Hospitall, whereof mention is before made in each of the Precedent Charters, the Donor thereof (I take it) and (I beleeve) a chiefe agent in the Hospitals do|tation, if not first erection also. The rest of the revenew lay at <HI>Egerton, Charing, Mersham, Bleane, Hakynton, Natin|don, Thamington, Shadoxherst, Kingsnoth, Rokinge,</HI> and in and about the City; altogether in the Inventory summo|ned up, <HI>de claro,</HI> at 46^l. 6^s. 3^d. If any thinke it worth their labour to peruse the Survey of the State of this Hospitall in every particular as it was presented to those Commissi|oners, it is in my custody, at their service. It payeth now no Tith at all (nor by law ought to pay any <HI>de hortis et ani|malibus</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Cap. 2. de ec|cles. aedificand. Cui adjungas velim Statuta <HI>Huberti</HI> Ar|chiep. in <HI>Hove|den.</HI> pag. 809. edit. <HI>Francof.</HI></NOTE>:) but by that Survey it evidently appeares a con|sideration in money in lieu of Tith of the site of the Hospi|tall, paid to the Parson of <HI>Thanington, viz. 18^d. per annum.</HI></P>
<P>However the generall Dissolution spared this Hospitall, (as I thinke it did:) yet it seemes it did not long survive the same. For what saith the Record <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Liber Registri Domini Archid. <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE> taken of the State of it in Cardinall <HI>Pooles</HI> Visitation, holden <HI>Anno 1557? Me|morand'</HI> (saith the same) that <HI>Young</HI> the Fermor saith that <HI>Freeman,</HI> and one <HI>Dartnall</HI> caused the Sisters to surrender the house to the King, and from the King this same came to the said <HI>Dartnall,</HI> by the Kings Letters Patents, and saith that their Lands were worth a hundreth markes by the yeare, and saith that it is in divers mens hands, whereof
<PB N="80" REF="59">
S^r <HI>Edward Walton</HI> hath bought a great part of the lands which lieth about him, and he himself hath the Mansion house and a part of the land, and saith that the sisters have xlvj^s^. viij^d. by the yeare pension, and there is but one alive that he knoweth.</P>
<P>I will now crosse the meadows and river and make up to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herbaldowne</HI> Hospitall.</NOTE> <HI>Herbaldown,</HI> to take a survey of the Hospitall there. It lies also (I confesse) out of the liberty of the City. Yet, for neighbourhood sake, and in regard it was built for the be|nefit of leprous people of the City (as I conceive:) and continues a harbour to the aged poore (chiefly) of the same, I have thought it worthy our survey.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon which (because this was also a Lazar <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leprosie.</NOTE> house) let me take a little notice of the wondrous com|monnesse of that loathsome disease, the Elephantiasy, or Leprosie in this kingdome of old time: which M^r <HI>Cambden</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Britan. <HI>in</HI> Leicestershire.</NOTE> thinks entered this Iland with the Normans. A rare dis|ease amongst us (thanked be God) in these dayes, and from what cause so much abounding as in our forefathers, is not now of us easily discovered. It seems to have been a nationall malady, and accordingly in all parts provision made for receit and relief of such persons as that (as I may call it) <HI>comitiall</HI> disease had marked out for sequestration from publick commerce. Whereof there were no lesse then three about this City, this of <HI>Herbald</HI> one, <HI>S. Iacobs</HI> another, and <HI>S. Lawrence</HI> a third.

<P>Archbishop <HI>Richard, Beckets</HI> immediate Successor in a charter <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Iuter chartas Hosp. S.

payable out of <HI>Reculver</HI> Parsonage. Which 160 <HI>lib.</HI> conti|nued afterwards constantly paid unto them, and un-altered, untill Archbishop <HI>Kilwardby's</HI> dayes. For so it appeares by an exemplification made of certain Charters of those Ho|spitalls, under the seal of <HI>Thomas Chicheley,</HI> D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the De|crees, Archdeacon of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and Prothonotary to the Pope, and signed by his <HI>Registrorum Custos</HI> and <HI>Actorum S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ri|ba:</HI> namely, that from <HI>Beckets</HI> time downward untill <HI>Kil|wardbyes,</HI> these 2 Hospitalls had and received by equall di|vision yearely 240 marks or 160 <HI>lib.</HI> of the Archbishops Chamber, saving that 20 <HI>lib.</HI> of it was paid them of the Parson of <HI>Reculver.</HI> This, <HI>Kilwardby</HI> misliking, withdraws their stipend, and in lieu assignes and appropriat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> over to them his Parsonage of <HI>Reculver,</HI> with the Chapels annexed. But for some inconveniences (that of the leprous conditi|on of the people of this Hospitall, the main, rendring them both unable and unfit to attend and intermeddle in a tithe|ry, especially so remote:) his next Successor <HI>Iohn Peckham</HI> alters and revokes what he <HI>(Kilwardby)</HI> had done, and red|integrates the Hospitalls into their former estate. Archbi|shop <HI>Stratford</HI> afterwards gets the King <HI>(Ed.</HI> 3.) of whom this Parsonage held <HI>in capite,</HI> by his Charter, to appropri|ate it <HI>mensae Archiepiscopali,</HI> to the Archbishops table, yet charged with that old payment or stipend, which <HI>Simon I slip</HI> afterwards, with consent of the Chapter, the Prior and Co|vent, confirms unto them, and that (for the better strength|ning of their title, maintainable as yet onely by customa|ry right, having no sufficient <HI>jus scritpum</HI> to show) by his charter in writing, whereby to recover it, if at any time de|nied or detained. Ever since which time they have peace|ably enjoyed the same. These things I thought good the rather to deduce, that I might vindicate that false aspersion wherewith some of the old people of these Hospitalls, ig|norant altogether of the premised passages, are wont to de|prave some of the Archbishops of former times, for depri|ving them of this and that Mannor, and I know not what other means, revenues and indowment, wherewith they
<PB N="84" REF="61">
say and will tell you their houses were at first so richly in|dowed, as they cannot think their Prior of old time, any lesse man forsooth then a Lord Prior, I wot. But thus o|thers have told them, and they think they may take it up upon trust, and say as much after them.</P>
<P>I shall not insist on the specification of the other reve|nues of this Hospitall, whereof, by the charity of former times, it hath a pretty competency: <HI>Eilgar</HI> at <HI>Bourne</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Tonford</HI> neighbours to the place in their time being the prime (I take it) of the secular benefactors, as King <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. was of the Royall, who gave to the poore here 20 marks a yeare, out of of the City Fee-ferme, payable by the Chamber.</P>
<P>This Hospitalls ancient governour, now called a Master, was a Deane. For to a very ancient deed of the Hospitall (amongst other witnesses) one <HI>Benedict</HI> in the first place subscribes, with this addition of <HI>tunc temporis Decani de san|cto Nicolao.</HI> Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> 23. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Inter Chartas Hospitalis.</NOTE> by his bull, discharged this Ho|spitall of payment of tithes <HI>de hertis, virgultis &amp; animalium nutrimentis.</HI></P>

<P>What he there addes of a Priory of black Canons, which (as he saith) was originally annexed to this Hospitall by <HI>Lanfranc</HI> the founder, is but a tale.

<P>What number of Canons here were required by the foundation, I know not, but in a visitation <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Lib. Registri Consistor. Cant.</NOTE> of the Priory by Cardinall <HI>Bourchier,</HI> onely five give up their names with the Prior, who indeed then complained of the pauci|ty of his Canons, which (as he layes the fault) was occasi|oned by the diminution of their revenewes, or (in his owne words) their Lands, Tents and Rents. Which their reve|new what it was, or where it lay, I can say but little; because I could never as yet get a sight of the Leiger.</P>
<P>Concerning this Priory, in the Booke of <HI>Doomsday,</HI> in the Archbishops Mannor of Stove-saete or Westgate (as we now call it) thus I read. <HI>Et inibi sunt iterum</HI> xxx. <HI>&amp;</HI> ij. <HI>mansurae &amp; unum molendinum, quae tenent clerici sancti Gre|gorii ad eorum ecclesiam.

This Priory had other indowment, consisting (as <HI>Edmerus</HI> showes) as well in Tithes as Temporalties. As for their Titheries, in the yeare 1292. (at what time their Temporalties in <HI>Canterbury, Natyndon, Hugevelde, Chertham, Tanintone,</HI> and <HI>Herbal|downe,</HI> were together valued at xxx^l. xv^s.) they were these, the Parsonages of <HI>Taninton, Westgate, Northgate,</HI> S^t <HI>Dunstan, Natindon, Livingsborn, Waltham, Elmested, Be|trichedenne, Stallesfield.</HI> Together with certaine Titheries in <HI>Goldstaneston, Berham, Plukele,</HI> and <HI>Risseburne</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Lib. eccles.

<P>As appertaining, so also adjoyning to this Priory, before and untill the Dissolution (yea and after too) was a Coemi|tery or Church-yard, not proper onely to the Priory, for the buriall of the Domesticks, but which was (whether of right, or by curtesie onely, I know not) common to others also with them, and those not the Hospitallars onely (the reason why they were till very lately destitute of any Church-yard within themselves) but also the Parishioners of <HI>Northgate,</HI> their neighbours, of which Church this Pri|ory had the Patronage, who did constantly, by their Wils, appoint their Burials in that Church-yard, and never men|tion other of their owne: it faring with them as with those other Parish Churches of the City, which belonging some to Christ-Church, some to Saint <HI>Augustines,</HI> had their want of Church-yards supplyed by those Monasteries. This at Saint <HI>Gregories</HI> continued to the Parish of <HI>Northgate</HI> after the dissolution, untill (as the tradition goes) Sir <HI>Iohn Boys</HI> the late Tenent to the Priory obtained to appropriate and inclose it upon exchange of the moderne Church-yard
<PB N="91" REF="64">
ground for it with the Churchwardens of Northgate for the time being. It continued (I say) till then to the Pa|rish, for a buriall place; <HI>de facto,</HI> but was not acknowledged theirs of right. For at a visitation <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Lib.

<P>It hath been a thing much controverted between the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Controversie between the City and S. <HI>Gregories.</HI></NOTE> City and this Priory, whether it be of the Cities liberty or not.

This of S. <HI>Iohns</HI> time was fired in <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. time, as I finde by certain letters of the Hospitall under their seal, framed after the manner of a brief, &amp; directed to all prelates in generall, wherein they in pitifull manner deplore their miserable estate occasioned (as they say) by a late lament|able fire happening in their house, which had wasted their Hospitall and adjacent edifices, in the which were more then an 100 poore people sustained, with desire of their cha|ritable relief, letting them know (as the most perswasive Rhetorick of that age) what indulgences had been grant|ed to their benefactors by severall Archbishops and Bishops of former times.</P>

<P>I have now surrounded the Suburbs, yet having hitherto said nothing of Westgate-street, the Suburbs (I mean) ly|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Westgate-street.</NOTE> without Westgate, exempt from the libertie and Fran|chese of the City, give me leave here to give it a place a|part, and therewith to finish my survey of the Suburbs, and then I shall enter the walls.</P>
<P>I have seen a presentment in Eire, inrolled in the Kings Exchequer of the 21. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. wherein <HI>(inter alia)</HI> this street (Westgate-street) is presented and avouched, how truly I know not, to have anciently belonged to the Citi|zens of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> subject with the City to tax and aid; but in King <HI>Iohns</HI> time to have been taken from the City by <HI>Hubert</HI> the Archbishop, to the Cities great damage, in re|gard merchants and men of worth and estates withdrew
<PB N="95" REF="66">
themselves thither, and there hous'd themselves, and were defended of the Archbishop against the Cities impositions. But whether this part of our Cities Suburbs, were not from all Antiquity, as now it is, clearely exempted from the Franchese and Liberty thereof, because part of the Arch|bishops Mannor (and Hundred) of Westgate, as we now call it, or of <HI>Stoursaete,</HI> as of old it was named, distinct from the City-Hundred (as it seemes it was no other of old) may deserve inquiry and consideration, and the rather (sith <HI>Doomsday</HI> Booke Records, that the Archbishop then chal|lenged to have <HI>Forisfacturam in viis extra Civitatem ex utra|que parte ubi terra sua est)</HI> because the Archbishop, in right of his See, is <HI>Dominus Fundi</HI> (Lord of the Soile) on either side this Street. It makes much for this what <HI>Edmerus</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Hist. Novor. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> said upward of 500 yeares agone, that in the Lands of the Arch|bishopricke throughout the Kingdome, by an ancient cu|stome and usage, the Archbishop hath the sole mannaging of things aswell humane, as divine. But enough of the street.</P>
<P>Somewhat I have heard of a <HI>Ferry</HI> sometime at this place, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferry.</NOTE> belonging, as I am told, to the Archbishop, who did ar|rent it out for 16^d. <HI>per annum.</HI> But I have seene no record to warrant the relation, and therefore no more of that untill I be better instructed.</P>
<P>The Archbishop and the Citizens, both (as bound by oath, if I mistake not) standing in the defence and main|tenance of their liberties, the one of his See, the other of their City, have anciently much differed about liberties here, but now and of a long time all such matters have been well accorded and settled betweene them; wherefore, and because I much desire they should ever so continue, <HI>ex pro|fesso,</HI> I decline the discourse of their quarels, least I may seeme to rub up old sores.</P>
<P>Having now done with Westgate-street, I will take the next way into the City, and that is by Westgate. But ere we passe or enter further then the Gate, I must, according to my purposed method premise and say somewhat of the Wards of the City.</P>

<PB N="96" REF="67">
<HEAD>Division of the City into Wards.</HEAD>
<P>THe Wards of our City at this day are, as (I take it) <NOTE PLACE="marg">Number and names of the Wards.</NOTE> they ever were, nor more nor lesse then sixe in number. In name distinguished and differenced from each other, by the names of the sixe principall Gates, that is. 1. West|gate-ward. 2. Newingate-ward. 3. Northgate-ward. 4. Worthgate-ward. 5. Burgate-ward, and 6. Ridingate-ward. Of that number at first, haply in imitation of the Shires division into 6. Lathes, whereof it did of old consist.</P>
<P>Of the first division made of the City into Wards, nei|ther written Record, nor unwritten Tradition makes any <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their origi|nall.</NOTE> mention. But I conceive it very ancient. The whole Ci|ty (it seemes) in the Conquerors time, was but one intire hundred. For <HI>Doomsday</HI> Booke speaking of the Churches Mannor of <HI>Barton,</HI> which it calleth <HI>North-wood,</HI> saith it was <HI>de hundredo de Cantuarberia,</HI> as the very words are. If so, it was not long ere a sub-division made of it, haply for more easie and good Government, into divers severall hundreds, namely into the sixe Wards or hundreds now under our Survey. For the more ancient appellation and terme given to those our Cities moderne sub-divisions of Wards, was Hundred, as almost all our eldest deeds and other like evidences doe witnesse, which generally, close with a <HI>memorandum,</HI> that they were first made and recorded in the hundred of that Division (as in the hundred of West|gate, Burgate, and so alike for the rest) and afterwards in the Burgmote of the City. Another terme they had some|what varying from the other in sound, but of synonymall sense and signification with it, which was <HI>Bertha,</HI> a frequent phrase in our ancient evidences.</P>
<P>These Divisions, <HI>Fitz-Stephens,</HI> in his description of <HI>London,</HI> endeavouring to paralell it, all he could, with old <HI>Rome,</HI> calls Regions. Every of these Divisions, Hundreds, Wards, Regions, was committed and intrusted, for reigle|ment, to an Alderman, one in office and authority, the
<PB N="97" REF="67">
same (I take it) with <HI>Praepositus Hundredi,</HI> or the Hundreds Ealdor, as our Ancestors would phrase it.</P>
<P>I will spare all discourse touching (what many mens inter|pretation hath made of vulgar knowledge) the word, Alder|man, both name, and office, in generall, derived, traduced and descended unto us from great antiquity, and confine my selfe to speake of those onely set over our City Wards. Whose antiquity I conceive to be from about <HI>Rich.</HI> 1. time; the generality of these Aldermen being said to bee of that ages production <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Vide Dn. <HI>Hen. Spelmanni</HI> Glossar. in hac voce.</NOTE> (foure hundred yeares old and up|wards.)</P>
<P>These Aldermen, every of them, had and kept within their Ward, and haply (as the Jewes held theirs <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Deuter. cap. 21 ver. 19. &amp; cap. 16.</NOTE>) at their severall Gates, a Court holden every three weekes, which was called of our ancestors sometime the Hundred-Court, sometime the Wardmote, that is, the meeting or assembly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wardmote.</NOTE> of the Hundred or Ward, or the Portmote, as the Juris|diction was called <HI>Port-soka.</HI></P>
<P>Their office, from their name, was called an <HI>Alderman|rie;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aldermanrie.</NOTE> which it seemes was not (as now) elective, but as free|hold either demiseable or deviseable, <HI>ad libitum</HI> of him or her that held the same: or if neither demised, nor devised of him nor her in life time, but indisposed of at death, then as inheritance and fee, descended to the next heire at law; and thence it was that (as I finde) most of the same <HI>Aldermanries</HI> continued in a name and family, through many descents and successions, as that of Burgate to the <HI>Chiches,</HI> of Northgate to the <HI>Polres</HI> or <HI>Pollers,</HI> as we now write it, of Newingate to the <HI>Digges,</HI> of Worthgate to the <HI>Cokyns,</HI> afterward to the <HI>Tiernes,</HI> of Westgate to the <HI>Brownes,</HI> and so of the rest.</P>
<P>This last of Westgate, was in 10. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. given by the Will <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Lib. Camerae Civitatis.</NOTE> of <HI>Henry Garnate</HI> to <HI>Sara</HI> his wife.

In some respects also it differed from the rest, which (I take it) were held onely by Freemen and inhabitants of the <HI>Franchise,</HI> whereas this was holden nei|ther by one nor tother, a great inconvenience to the City, as in the fore-cited act of Parliment (1 <HI>Rich.</HI> 1.) in the pre|face of it, is suggested.

<P>MArching on therefore from the Gate into the City, by the high Street (that, I meane, terminated by this Gate at the West, and by the opposite Newingate at the East-end) we have on this side Kingsbridge, on either hand of us a Gate that leads us to a severall ruined Monastery.

<P>These Franciscans or Minorite Friers being a great prop to the Papacy were prosecuted by severall Popes with many priviledges, immunities, indulgences and what not graces, that might assure them the Popes fast friends, and faithfull sonnes and servants. Beside their exemption and immunitie from Episcopall and all other ordinary Juris|diction; in matter of tithes, they were priviledged from payment of any, either of their house, their orchard (or garden) and the nutriment. i. the herbage or agistment of their Cattell, as in the Decretalls <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Nimis prava. 12. de excessib. praelat.</NOTE>.

And that was a thing whereof multi|tudes were ambitious, and the rather because they were made beleeve, that who so was buried amongst them, espe|cially ifin the holy and vertuous habit of a Frier, should not onely be secured from evill spirits that would else haply disturb the quiet of his grave, but also be as sure to go to heaven. There is authentick record of many worthy per|sonages, and of worshipfull families that have been here in|terred: the Catalogue of whom <HI>Wever</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Of ancient funerall Mo|numents. <HI>pag.</HI> 238.</NOTE> hath collected and delivers, but under a wrong title, saying they were bu|ried in the White, whereas he should have said the Gray-Friers: as I can make good to the satisfaction of any that makes a doubt hereof.</P>

Indeed (to be short) almost every testate dying man of the City and neighbouring parts of any worth, remem|bred these FF.

One domestick benefactor I meet with, one <HI>Richard Mar|tin,</HI> the Guardian (I take it) of the house, who in the yeare 1498. by his will <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">In Registro memorato.</NOTE> gave liberally both to the Church and Co|vent. He was (as it seems by his will) Parson also of <HI>Ickham,</HI> and Vicar of <HI>Lyd</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> But what may he mean by writing himself (as he doth) Bishop of the universall Church? a title so cried down and condemned as Anti-christian by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great; I conceive he was a titular Bi|shop, a Bishop in name and title onely, endued with the Or|der, but not with the Jurisdiction Episcopall, having no particular charge to intend, but generally officiating as Bishop in any part of the Christian Church. These titular Bishops were frequent with us in those dayes. About the same time one <HI>Thomas Wells,</HI> the Prior of S. <HI>Gregories</HI> by <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in his will <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">In eod.

<P>Let me but acquaint you, that John <HI>Peckham</HI> Archbishop

It is said of them, that King <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. at their co|ming received them kindly (so did <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> also the then Archbishop <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Harpsfield.</HI> Hi. Eccles. Anglic. Saec. 13 cap. 11.</NOTE>:) and placed them at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where (it seemes) he built them this late Monastery, which was the first that the Kingdome had of that kinde. Hence and from this ground I suppose <HI>Wever</HI> takes his warrant for at|tributing the erection of this house to <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. The title proper to the governour of the Dominicans, was Prior. Like the Franciscans, they and the Monkes of Christ-Church, in the same yeare with the other (1294) came to composi|tion about divers houses and lands lying within their pre|cinct.</P>

to those Commissioners, by the Parson and Churchwar|dens of All Saints: who say withall, that the said Hospitall (as their own words are) is a Parish Church, wherein there is continually ministred all Sacraments and Sacramentalls to the poore people thither resorting, and to the keeper of the said Hospitall and his houshold, and all other remain|ing within the precinct of the same by the Chantere Priest &amp;c.

<P>For brevity and dispatch sake, I balk and spare the men|tion of much of this Hospitalls indowment. But there is yet a parcell more, which I may not so passe over; and that is of certain tenements in All-Saints Parish, situate between the signe of the George West, and the Queens head East, in the high-street. Thither then I will make next: But first, for some satisfaction to them that cannot understand the foundation of the house formerly laid down in Latine, I desire first to set down the state of it in which it stood at

<P>Now to the tenements which haply seem to be so mean as scarce worthy of any notice. True. But for what hath sometime stood here, and into the place whereof they have succeeded, I think scarce a place in the City more remark|able, if at all so memorable: which was an Exchange, a roy|all Exchange. <HI>Cambium Regis:</HI> mention whereof often <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exchange.</NOTE> occurres in the old rentals and other records of Christ-Church, whose tenement (now the George) is anciently bounded Eastward to this Exchange.

For he in augmentation of the Ho|spitalls indowment gave it <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Lib. de East|bridge.</NOTE> to the then Master of East|bridge, by name, <HI>Thomas New</HI> of <HI>Wolton,</HI> for life, and after|wards to his Successors for ever. Which <HI>Thomas</HI> shortly af|ter, dividing it (it seems) into tenements, hires them out in fee-ferme to severall Tenents, <HI>viz.</HI> one part thereof to the then Commissary of <HI>Cant.

Ed.</HI> 3. Both which demises I was desirous to ex|presse at large, because I have not seen any other record that sets forth at all what kinde of building this Exchange was.</P>
<P>For the antiquity of its continuance here before the sup|pression; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ts standing here.</NOTE> I cannot say much. In the sixt yeare of <HI>H. 3. anno Domini</HI> 1222. I meet with the Kings Exchange at <HI>Canterb.</HI> For <HI>Henry</HI> the third <HI>(Stow</HI> ^n is my author) in the sixt yeare of his reigne, wrote to the <HI>Scabines</HI> and men of <HI>Ipre,</HI> that he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Survey.</HI> pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">51. ult. edit.</NOTE> and his counsell had given prohibition, that none English|men, or other, should make change of plate, or other masse of silver, but onely at his Exchange at <HI>London,</HI> or at <HI>Canter|bury.</HI></P>
<P>Shortly, there was sometime a family in our City, which from their neighbourhood or other relation to this place, took name from it, and were sirnamed <HI>De Cambio.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="80">
An exchange relates to a Mint, or place of mintage and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mint.</NOTE> coynage of money; but of old, as will appeare by the Stat. <HI>anno primo H. 6. cap.</HI> 4. they might not be together, but were kept apart, and a place there was sometime neighbouring to the Exchange, on the other side of the same street, even there where now the Inne called the Crown or some part of it stands where our Mint was kept. <HI>In angulo monetariae versus East,</HI> is part of the boundary to that which is now the dwelling house of <HI>Isaac Clerk.</HI> The Officers and Ministers retaining to this Mint had their housing hard by it in some tenements of Christ-Church. Whence in their old rentalls is frequent mention <HI>De monetariis in parochia Sanctae Mariae Bredman.</HI> This Mint (I take it) was silenced about the same time with the Exchange, for of latter yeers I finde no men|tion of it.</P>
<P>From what antiquity it had stood and been kept at this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity of it</NOTE> place I know not. But amongst the places where King <HI>Iohn</HI> in his letters makes mention of Mints kept in England, this City is one <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Stow. <HI>Survey.</HI> pag. 46.</NOTE>, and had been so (I suppose) for many ages. King <HI>Aethelstane</HI> appointing out the places for Mints, and the number of minters throughout the Kingdome <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><HI>Limbert.</HI> Ar|choeonom.</NOTE>, begins with <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to which he allowed seven minters: a greater number then to any other place in the Kingdome, except <HI>London,</HI> which was allowed to have eight. Of these 7, foure were for the King, two for the Archbishop, and the seventh for the Abbat of S. <HI>Augustines.</HI> The Archbishops mint (it seems) is yet elder. For M^r <HI>Selden</HI> in his notes up|on <HI>Edmerus,</HI> and <HI>Speed</HI> in his History make mention of two severall coynes, one of Archbishop <HI>Plegmund</HI> under <HI>Alfred,</HI> the other of <HI>Celnoth</HI> under <HI>Ethelwolf</HI> extant, and presented in figure, by <HI>Speed</HI> the latter, by <HI>Selden</HI> the former. When or how the Arohbishop lost or left off his mintage here, I do no where finde. Of the time when the Abbats ceased I have showed before out of <HI>Thorne,</HI> in my Survey of S. <HI>Aug.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst other pieces of antique (Romane, Britain, Saxon, Danish and Norman) coyne which I have met with and reserve, some were stamped in this Mint, I take it; in
<PB N="124" REF="81">
this City, of certain, the reverse of the coyne saith so; I have withall a piece or two of <HI>H.</HI> 8. coyned at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> not here, but as I conceive at the place now called the Mint by the Court-gate of Christ-Church; where after the dis|solution he coyned money for the service (they say) of his French warres. Ever since which time, the place therefore retains the name of the Mint, and the court or yard which it incloseth is called the Mint-yard. So much for the Mint.</P>
<P>Retreating a little from this place, on the same side of the street there is a place where sometime the Jews, that, of old, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jewes in <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE> for a long time together, were suffered to dwell amongst us in most of our chief Cities, kept their residence; being housed in this street and in the lane by it, from thence to this day called Jury-lane, the same. (I take it) which of old I finde called Little-pet-lane <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Rental, vel. eccles. Cant.</NOTE>. There was of their houses hereaway to the number of almost 20. All which, toge|ther with their Synagogue, or (as more frequently called) <HI>Schola Iudaeorum,</HI> their School, upon their generall banish|ment out of this and all other parts of the kingdome in <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. daies (at what time their number amounted unto 16511 <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Matt. weslm. de anno 1290.</NOTE>.) as confiscate, escheated to the King: and by him were eft|soones, some of gift, some otherwise alienated, some to one, some to another, but the most (to the number <HI>viz.</HI> of at least 12. and a void piece of ground which was <HI>Commu|nitatis Iudaeorum Civitatis,</HI> .i. the Jewes in common) to the Monks of Christ-Church <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Lib. eccles. Christi Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. Their Synagogue or School stood about where now some part of the Saracens head Ta|verne doth, as appeares by the Records of Christ-Church. Which have this bound to certain fee of the late Monks hard by it, <HI>viz. Terrae in parochia omnium Sanctorum inter ma|gnum vicum qui est versus Aquilonem, &amp; Scholam Iudaeorum quae est versus Austrum, juxta venellam qua itur &agrave; praedicto ma|gno vico versus sanctam Mildritham:</HI> being that ground (I take it) whereon the forepart (to the street-ward) of that which is now the Saracens head Taverne, being in show newer then the back-part, was afterward built. To which ground the very next house above (the Mitre) is bounded
<PB N="125" REF="81">
Westward, and called <HI>domus juxt a scolam Iudeorum,</HI> thus ex|plained in the Rentall, <HI>viz. Domus lapidea quae est contra terram ubi scola Iudaeorum sita est versus Occidentem.</HI> By all which I collect and verily conceive, that the now Stone-Parlour of the Saracens head, mounted upon a Vault and ascended by many Stone-steps (as the Iewish Synagogues and Schooles were alwayes built aloft <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron. lib. 2. cap. 2. pag. 80.</NOTE>) is the Remaines of a good part of that which was our <HI>Canterbury</HI> Iewes Schoole or Synagogue.</P>
<P>I could here very much enlarge my selfe in giving you the Story of the Iewes first advent or entrance into this Land, their time of continuance here, with their behavi|our and dealings during that time, and the causes, reasons and motives for their expulsion at last: which were chiefely two; their immoderate usury; and their barbarous practice of crucifying, at places where they abode, any Christians child they could get about Easter time. But I am preven|ted here in by many others that have severally divulged these things already to the full; as <HI>Harpsfield,</HI> and <HI>Stow,</HI> but more exactly and most elaborately and like himselfe, our learned <HI>Selden, Purcases</HI> guide and Author for a purposed discourse of this kinde; wherefore I forbeare, <HI>ne actum agerem:</HI> onely adding what I have seene noted, (but how truely I know not) that the Iewes, when living here, were such notorious Vsurers, that Usury, among the Christians, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vsury called Iudeisme.</NOTE> became called <HI>Iudaisme. Pro praemiss is Abbas donatorem ac|quietavit de 28<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. in Iudeismo, loco gersumiae:</HI> as it is in an old deed. And they still continue this trade wheresoever they become, whereby they grow rich even to envy every where, yet (as one saith <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sandys</HI> Relati|on of Religi|on, &amp;c.</NOTE>) many of the Christians doe use them under hand in improving their unlawfull rents to their utmost proportion.</P>
<P>Now a word or two of the Gild-hall (or Court-hall, as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gildhall.</NOTE> we call it) and my survey of this Ward is at an end. Here then, as in the fittest, and most convenient place, being the principall street of the City, is the Court, Tribunall, or place of Judicature of the City seated and kept: where di|stributive
<PB N="126" REF="82">
Justice in both, civill and criminall causes, of se|cular nature, sorting to the cognizance of that Court, is administred. Vulgarly we call the place the <HI>Gildhall.</HI> The etymology and derivation whereof is from the Saxon (or old English) word, <HI>Gild,</HI> signifying a society or corporati|on. Here is a Court kept every Munday throughout the yeare, for Law-matters, and for the deciding of differen|ces and righting of grievances betweene party and party; and on every other Twesday a Court of Burgmote holden beside, for meeting and treaty about the affaires and good government of the City. It had not the name of the Gild|hall untill (as it were) of late yeares. That name of it oc|curres not in any record that I could yet meet with, untill the 26. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. who then in his Charter of the change of the Bailiffes into a Maior, makes mention of this Tribunall by that name, granting <HI>(inter alia)</HI> that the Maior shall hold pleas <HI>in le Guildhall Civitatis praedict.</HI> as his words are. A|foretime <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spech-house.</NOTE> it was commonly called and knowne by the name of the Spech-house; and the common goale or prison of the City, since removed to Westgate, being then kept by it, that is in that part of it which is to the street-ward, was from it adjacency to it, so called also. For proofe both of one and tother read the following notes extracted from certaine witnesses examinations, <HI>Anno</HI> 1414. taken in a cause of defamation, betweene a couple of the City (for calling one the other Thiefe, a crime and calumny where|in the defamed of those dayes did usually after purgation, right himselfe in Court Christian) and recorded in a Booke of Depositions remaining in the Office <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Regist. Consist. <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE>. Whereof one is this: <HI>Dicit</HI> (saith the witnesse) <HI>quod Iohannem Copherst semel vidit in quadam domo vocat' Spech-house scituat' juxta Hospiti|um Leonis in alto vico Cant. in parochia sanctae Mariae Bredman.</HI> Another this. <HI>Occasione hujusmodi verborum dictus Thomas fuer at arrestatus ad prisonam vocat' Spech-house in alto vico Cant. scituat' &amp; ibidem dictus T.

<P>The Towne-Court hath not alwayes beene kept at this place: but, as now it is and of long time hath beene here, so both it and the prison were formerly kept together else|where, and that (I take it) at the place of the now Corne-Market, and were then also called the Spech-house (of which before at large:) Very properly did they stand con|tiguously together, if <HI>Tholosanus</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">De Republica. lib. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE> judgement in this point be to be followed who saith. <HI>Iuxta tribunalia &amp; continentes sint carceres qui ad custodiam judicandorum aedificari debent, tuti &amp; contra vim omnem muniti ut inde facilius &amp; cum minori periculo ad judicium duci &amp; reduci possint.</HI> Thus he. But why the place of Judicature called the Spech-house? Proper|ly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence called the Spech-house.</NOTE> some thinke, from the arguing and debating of matters there, not without much vociferation. And not unlikely. With as much congruity (I dare say) as <HI>For us</HI> is of <HI>Isodore</HI> derived a <HI>fando,</HI> from speaking.

<HEAD>Northgate Ward.</HEAD>
<P>THis Ward offers and affords three remarkable places, to our Survey, and they are, 1. The place called Stable|gate.
<PB N="133" REF="85">
2. the <HI>quondam</HI> house of the Templars. 3. The late house of the black Princes chantery Priests.</P>
<P>I will begin with Stablegate. A borough or hamlet by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stablegate.</NOTE> Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. made to the City excepted from the Franchise of the same, as being a parcell of the vill of West|gate, and of the see and liberty of the Archbishop, to whom of old it hath belonged: it being taken for the very place where <HI>Augustine</HI> the first Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and his company were entertained and seated by King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> before he resigned to him his royall Palace. <HI>Concessit cis (Thornes</HI> words) <HI>locum habitationis in civitate Doroberniae sci|tuatum, viz. infra parochiam Sancti Aclphegi, ex opposito regiae stratae versus Aquilonem; per murum Palatii Archiepiscopalis in longitudine se extendit, in quo Augustinus cum suis domesticis usque ad conversionem Regis hospitatus est. Fuerat tunc temporis quasi oratorium pro familia Regis ut ibi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dorarent &amp; Diis suis li|beros immolarent. Sanctus ver&ograve; ille hospes tanta hospitium suum voluit libertate promovere, &amp; ab exactionibus quorumcunque per|petualiter acquietare, qu&ograve;d neque Civibus in tallagiis &amp; assessi|onibus quoquo modo debeant respondere, vel eis subsidium aliquod praestare: sed Archiepiscopo in omnibus subjacere, &amp; ut suum Palatium firma libertate gaudere. Ita ut si fures vel homicidae vel alii quan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is indictati situm de Stablegate valeant introire; ut in ecclesia, libertate gaudebunt.</HI> Thus he.</P>
<P>Whence it took the name of Stablegate, I am as yet igno|rant. Some surmise from the staple of wool which ancient|ly was kept in the City. <HI>Canterbury</HI> being one of the places where by the stat. 27. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. it was ordained to be kept, and the onely place that two yeares before (25. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.) the same King appointed for the keeping of it at, for the ho|nour of S^t <HI>Thomas</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Stow. <HI>Survey.</HI> pag 496. ult. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ditionis.</NOTE>. If so, then is there a mistake in the wri|ting of it Stablegate, for Staplegate.</P>
<P>There was sometime a family in our City, who from their habitation either at or neare this place, were sirnamed <HI>De Stablegate,</HI> and of <HI>Stab.</HI> whereof one <HI>Edmund Stablegate</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Edmund Stable|gate.</NOTE> (the same man I take it that <HI>Lambert</HI> speaks of. Peramb. of <HI>Kent,</HI> in <HI>Bilsington)</HI> in the 42. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. was a Bailiff of the City.

For to a deed or Charter of <HI>Nicholas</HI> at <HI>Crouch,</HI> made to the Hospitall of Eastbridge <HI>(de quieta clamatione juris sui in quodam tenemento cum gardino &amp; pertinen' scituat' in parochia sancti Petri Cant. inter curtilagium de Estbridge versus East, &amp; murum lapideum fratrum minorum Cant. versus West, conti|nen' in longitudine a regia strata versus North usque ad aquam del Stour vers.

He had also a seat or habitation in the Suburbs by <HI>Natindon,</HI> limitaneous to the Cities Fran|chise thereaway, as the perambulation thereof will show.</P>
<P>I leave Stablegate, and passe to the house of the Tem|plars. <NOTE PLACE="marg">House of Templars.</NOTE> An order of Knights that began in the yeare 1118. These Knights Templars (saith <HI>Stow</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Survey <HI>pag.</HI> 438. &amp; 439.</NOTE>, speaking out of <HI>Mat|thew Paris,</HI> of the Temple in <HI>London)</HI> took their beginning about the yeare 1118. in manner following. Certain noble Knights bound themselves by vow in the hands of the Pa|triarch of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to serve Christ after the manner of Re|gular Canons, in chastity and obedience, and to renounce their own proper wills for ever: the first of which order were <HI>Hugh Pagan</HI> and <HI>Geffrey</HI> of S. <HI>Audomar.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas at the first they had no certain habitation, <HI>Baldwin,</HI> King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> granted unto them a dwelling place in his Palace by the Temple, and the Canons of the same Temple gave them the street, thereby to build there|in their houses of Office; and the Patriarch, the King, the Nobles, and the Prelates, gave unto them certain revenues out of their Lordships.</P>
<P>Their first profession was for safegard of the Pilgrims, co|ming to visit the Sepulchre, and to keep the high-wayes a|gainst the lying in wait of theeves &amp;c. About ten yeares af|ter, they had a rule appointed unto them, and a white habit by <HI>Honorius</HI> the second; then Pope; and whereas they had but nine in number, they began to increase greatly. After|ward in Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> time, they bare crosses of red cloth, on their uppermost garments, to be known from others, and in short time because they had their first Mansion hard
<PB N="135" REF="86">
by the temple of our Lord in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> they were called Knights of the Temple.</P>
<P>Many Noblemen in all parts of Christendome, became brethren of this order, and builded for themselves Temples in every City or great Town in England, but this (saith my Author) at <HI>London</HI> was their chief house, which they build|ed after the form of the Temple neare to the Sepulchre of our Lord at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> They had also (saith he) other Temples in <HI>Cambridge, Bristow, Canterbury, Dover, War|wick &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That in <HI>Canterbury Stow</HI> speaks of, was situate in North|gate Parish, in or neare Waterlock-lane (the lane, I con|ceive, under the Town-wall, and leading by Northgate Church within, down to the river running from Abbots|mill.) For I reade <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Thorne</HI> in vi|tis Abbat. Sancti Augustini.</NOTE> of a messuage, which in the yeare 1271 was given to S^t <HI>Austines</HI> Abbey by one <HI>Edmunde de Cambio scituat' in venella de Weterloke in parochia de Northgate, prope domos Templariorum &amp;c.</HI> When this sect of the Templars was abolished, and why, as also what became of their posses|sions, you may finde elsewhere.</P>
<P>Leaving them then, I shall show you next where the black <NOTE PLACE="marg">Princes Priests.</NOTE> Princes Chantery Priests were once housed, and so I shall have done with this Ward. Their house stood, I may say it yet stands (for so I take it, in part it doth) very neare, if not in the place where some part of the Templars habitati|on was situate. But let me first show you that such a house there once was, and that I shall do from the charter or deed of this Princes Chanteries foundation, in which are these words. <HI>Promora siquidem dictorum sacerdotum assignavimus quendam habitationis locum juxta elemosinariam dicti monaste|rii</HI> (meaning Christ-Church) <HI>in quo construetur &amp;c.</HI> where|with concurreth the relation of the Priests themselves (one of them at least) to <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. Commissioners, which hath these words ofit. Also the said Prince <HI>Edward</HI> gave to the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">id. Chaplains and to their Successours for ever a house in S. <HI>Alphies</HI> Parish, the yearely value of it is XX^s^. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next let me observe unto you that over an ancient
<PB N="136" REF="87">
stone-porch opening to the lane leading you from Stable|gate, Westward, towards the lane turning to Abbats-mill, there are yet undefaced the Black-Princes armes obvious to the eye of any observing passenger. And so by this time (I hope) the place is sufficiently discovered, and my task for this Ward absolved.</P>

<HEAD>Worthgate Ward.</HEAD>
<P>COming now to Worthgate ward. The first thing I shall survey there is the <HI>quondam</HI> Hospitall of poore Priests. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hospitall of Poore Priests.</NOTE> A Spittle first built and founded by <HI>Simon Langton</HI> Arch|deacon (and brother of <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> Archbishop) of <HI>Canterbury</HI> about the yeare 1240. Not (it seems) altoge|ther of his own purse, but chiefly by and with the alms and charitie of pious and devout benefactors. <HI>Quod Hospitale idem Archidiaconus diversorum elemosinis dicitur fundasse,</HI> saith <HI>Thorne</HI> relating the foundation of this Spittle. It was (I conceive) intended for a place of succour and relief to poore Priests. i. Chaplaines, Curates, and other like unbe|neficed Clerks, chiefly those (I suppose) that either by age or other infirmity, were disabled for the performance any longer of their holy function abroad in the world, and there|fore were here accommodated with a Chapell (wherein to pray, sing and celebrate for their benefactors, and to per|forme <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chapell.</NOTE> other divine duties) contiguous to this their habita|tion, dedicate, as their Hospitall, to the blessed Virgin; whose first fabrick was not, as now, of stone. One <HI>Thomas Wyke</HI> (Master, I take it of the Hospitall) <HI>anno</HI> 1373. new built it of stone, but it is now made and parcelled out into dwellings and work-houses.</P>
<P>Shortly after the Hospitalls foundation perfected, at <HI>Langton</HI> the founder his instance, the then Abbat and Co|vent of S. <HI>Augustines</HI> granted to it the Parsonage of <HI>Stod|mersh,</HI> of their Patronage. Of which grant my Author <HI>(Thorne)</HI> gives this Copy.</P>

<P>I shall not further insist on the particulars of this Hospi|tals demaines and revenewes, saving the Iland behinde it, and a forgotten milne sometime both neighbouring and belonging to it, called <HI>Medmilne,</HI> either I take it, because <NOTE PLACE="marg">Medmilne.</NOTE> situate by the Meadowes, <HI>quasi Meadmilne,</HI> or else because standing about mid-way betweene Saint <HI>Mildreds</HI> Mill on the one, and <HI>Eastbridge</HI> on the other side, <HI>quasi Middle|milne.</HI> Before the Hospitals erection it was the proper Mill of one <HI>Lambinus</HI> or <HI>Lambin,</HI> from either his birth-place or parentage, sirnamed <HI>Flandrensis</HI> or <HI>Fleming,</HI> who dwelt where since and now the Hospitall is seated; and living there, gave to <HI>Eastbridge</HI> Hospitall, beside 14. perches of his land lying in <HI>With,</HI> an annuity of one quarter of wheate out of the said Mill, of which gift I once tooke this note from <HI>Eastbridge</HI> Booke. <HI>Carta Lambini Flandrensis filii Adae de Berghes, Hospitali de una summa frumenti de molendino meo quod vocatur Medmilne, &amp; 14. perticatis terrae meae quae jacet Binnewytt inter ter.

<P>The Poore Priests afterwards succeeding <HI>Lambine</HI> in his seate, succeeded him (it seemes) in this Mill also. For in the yeare 1325. a controversie arising betweene the two Hospitals about this Mill <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Liber sancti <HI>Lawrentii.</HI></NOTE>, and that brought before <HI>Robert de Malling</HI> then Commissary of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> He, <HI>caus&acirc; prius cognit&acirc;,</HI> adjudged the Mill to the Hospitall, of Poore Priests. It stood charged neverthelesse with a Resolute of certaine bushels of wheat to <HI>Eastbridge</HI> Hospitall which it seemes by my Inventory of the present Hospitall taken in <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. time was foure bushels. For in the recitall there of the rents Resolute yearely going out of the same Hospitall, this is one. <HI>Item,</HI> to the Hospitall of <HI>Eastbridge</HI> in <HI>Canter|bury</HI> in wheate foure bushels.</P>

of all right and title to which house (or challenge thereof) the poore Priests <HI>Anno</HI> 1242. coming to be neigh|bours to it (and their neighbour-hood, it seemes, of the jealous Monkes suspected) make a Charter <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Liber eccles. <HI>Cant.</HI></NOTE> of release to them, namely (as the words of it are) <HI>de Iure suo in quadam terra &amp; domo apud Hottewell</HI> (for so it seemes, the place was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hottewell.</NOTE> called) <HI>quae est juxta pontem ex parte aquilonari;</HI> to which they put <HI>Simon Langton</HI> the Archdeacons Seale, because they had then (as they say in their Charter, by reason, I take it, their Hospitall was but newly founded) no seale as yet of their owne.</P>

<P>Next I am perswaded (and so may easily, I thinke, any one be that well observes the place) that the workes both within and without the present Wall of the City, were not counter-workes one against the other, as the vulgar opini|on goes; but were sometimes all one entire plot containing about three Acres of ground; of a triangular forme (the out-worke) with a mount or hill intrenched round within it. And that, when first made and cast up, it lay wholly without the City-wall: and hath been (the hill or mount, and most part also of the out-worke) for the Cities more security, taken and walled in since: that side of the trench encompassing the mount now lying without, and under the wall, fitly meeting with the rest of the City-ditch, after either side of the out-worke was cut thorough to make way for it, at the time of the Cities inditching, as I suppose it cannot seeme unlikely to have beene, to any that shall con|siderately marke and examine the place.</P>

<P>Upwards, a little without Newingate, at Oaten-hill, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oaten-hill.</NOTE> now the Cities place of execution, was that commodity of oats, sometime vented; as at the same place before, salt <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rentale vet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cles.

<P>Not farre hence, to wit, by the Nunnery, at the meet|ing of the foure weuts or wayes there, another market was kept, or the former continued thither, whence the field over against the Nunnery, Southward, now almost all over digged for chalk, is anciently called Market-field <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Lib.

To live chastly, to possesse nothing, and to obey their Superiours commands. Again <HI>Benet</HI> gave un|to his Monks a new kinde of habit, he appointed them also a certain form of praying, and intending to allow them but mean commons, prescribed them a new rule of abstinence. You have the story.</P>
<P>By the way, this congregation of S^t <HI>Benet</HI> grew by little and little to be so great, that it is almost incredible. There were no Monasteries (saith <HI>Reyner</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Apostolat.

<P>Thus I am told; how truely, I make some doubt, both because, though conversant in the Church Records, I never as yet met with any such seale, and for that the seale which was in use not long after the Conquest, namely both in the time of <HI>Anselme</HI> the Archbishop <HI>(Lanfrancs</HI> immedi|ate successor) and <HI>Arnulfe</HI> the Prior. 1. about the beginning of the eleventh century, which I have often seene, hath no other inscription at all on it, but this (nor would the proportion of the seale admit of a larger) <HI>Sigillum ecclesiae Christi.</HI> But to goe on.</P>
<P>Next after <HI>Lanfranc</HI> succeeded <HI>Anselme,</HI> as in his See, so in his piety. For in his time, and chiefely by his care, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cathedrall in|larged.</NOTE> cost and providence, that fabricke begun and perfected by his predecessor, became much enlarged; whereof <HI>Edmerus</HI> makes a double mention, to wit first, <HI>pag.</HI> 35. and againe <HI>pag.</HI> 108. <HI>Super hoc</HI> (saith he) <HI>ipsum Oratorium, quantum a majore turri in orientem porrectum est, ipso patre Anselmo pro|vidente, disponente auctum est.</HI> The Monkes (it seemes by <HI>Edmerus)</HI> magnificently finished this worke which <HI>Anselme</HI> piously began, the King <HI>(Hen.</HI> 1.) affoording it and them his countenance and encouragement.

<P>The Monkes now at length more neerely affected with the woefull havocke which these frequent fires had made of their Church-fabricke, either occasioned or furthered by some neighbouring edifices, carefully provide to re|move that cause, and for that end, divers houses belong|ing to S^t <HI>Austins,</HI> being built and situate neere unto their <HI>Campanile</HI> or Steeple standing on the Southside of their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Campanile</HI> of Christ-Church</NOTE> Church-yard; after much suite, they prevailed at length with those their neighbours the Monkes of Saint <HI>Aust.</HI> to exchange the houses with their ground about them for the like elsewhere.

Archbishop <HI>Arundell</HI> may not be forgotten, who questionlesse was not onely an encourager, but a bene|factor also in his owne particular to the workes I treate of, though I doubt of his building that Steeple, which Arch|bishop <HI>Parker</HI> followed by Bishop <HI>Godwin</HI> and some others, ascribe unto him, for some reasons which when I come to survey it, I shall propound.</P>
<P>Hitherto of parts new built. Now shortly of parts re|paired and beautified. I read <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Liber eccles.</HI> Cant.

And now have I done with the Story of the Fabricke. Onely I may not omit what had almost slipt my memory, that Archbishop <HI>Chicheley, Arun|dell,</HI> immediate Successor built the Steeple called of Bi|shop <HI>Godwin</HI> Oxford-tower, but vulgarly Dunstan-steeple, or the most part of it, and also the Library <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Author Antiq.

They are (saith he) set out to sight for premonition, that no Courtier afterward should lay violent hands either upon the persons of Bishops, or their possessions.</P>
<P>Now enter we the body of the Church, a right noble <NOTE PLACE="marg">Body.</NOTE> structure. <HI>Ingressis aperit sese spatiosa quaedam aedificii maje|stas,</HI> saith the same <HI>Erasmus</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Vbi supra.</NOTE>. This questionlesse is the identicall nave or body, of whose age and authors you so

lately heard. <HI>Turres sunt ingentes duae procul veluti salutantes advenas, miroque nolarum aenearum boatu long&egrave; lat&eacute;que regionem vicinam personantes,</HI> saith <HI>Erasmus</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Vbi supra.</NOTE>. Now that Steeple which you see at the West-end and South-side of the Church, is the Oxford-tower, or Dunstan-steeple I so late|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunstan-steeple.</NOTE> spake of, and one of them. And the opposite one with the lofty spire or shaft covered with lead is the other, and the same that is said to be of Archbishop <HI>Arundells</HI> building, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arundell-steeple.</NOTE> and at this day called by his name. But under correction, without warrant of truth, as I conceive, induced thereunto partly from the work of the Steeple which I hold elder then <HI>Arundells</HI> time, by comparing it with other pieces of that age, and partly by this note in the records of the Church, seeming to me by the Character almost as ancient as the time of <HI>Arundell.</HI>

<P>This note you see calls it Angel, not Arundel-steeple, as I suppose it would have done; or at the lest have mentioned him the founder, had he indeed erected it. Besides I meet with the Angel-steeple in the Church-records long before <HI>Arundells</HI> time, .i. in the dayes of <HI>Henry</HI> of Eastry the Prior, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1317.</NOTE> and by the same name this very Steeple I finde to be called in divers dead mens wills <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">In Registris Consistorii &amp; Offi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Cant.</NOTE> since <HI>Arundells</HI> time.

<P>This nave or body of the Church <HI>omnes recepit</HI> (saith <HI>E|rasmus)</HI> admits of all comers, but at the upper end for the better security of the upper part of the Church, where the shrine was and other treasure, was of old parted off from the Quire by certain iron grates or barres; the doores whereof for the same reason doubtlesse, Archbishop <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> by his Statutes <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Liber ms. Ec|cles. Christi Cant.</NOTE>, commanded to be kept alwayes close shut, unlesse in time of Divine Service, or at other times of ne|cessary ingresse and egresse. Without offence to which in|junction
<PB N="166" REF="103">
let us enter. At or neare which place of entrance sometime stood a great crosse, in the head whereof was kept and inclosed that golden crown which (as is shewed be|fore) King <HI>Knute</HI> gave to the Church, and under it an altar: which was known by the name of <HI>Altare sanctae crucis inter chorum &amp; navem,</HI> and <HI>Altare sub magnacruce ecclesiae</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> archivis Ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es. praed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next observe we the first crosse-iles (wings some call them) of the Church, those (I mean) between the nave and the quire, which by the work, seem of like age with the body, saving that the North-Ile (the goodly and glorious window at the head whereof, a piece in it kinde beyond compare, was the gift of <HI>Ed.</HI> 4. as may be seen upon it) with the lofty Tower or Steeple in the middest or meeting of the Crosier by these capitall letters <HI>T. G. P.</HI> with the three gold stones; the mitre also and pastorall staffe in them both and Archbishop <HI>Warham's</HI> coat of armes beside in the roof of the latter (the Steeple;) I conceive of some|what a later building, and perfected, as in the time, so chiefly at the cost of Prior <HI>Goldstone</HI> in <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. dayes.</P>
<P>In this North-Ile, between the cloyster-doore and the Lady-chapell is a place inclosed and set apart, called to this day the Martyrdome. Archbishop <HI>Becket</HI> (as tradition hath <NOTE PLACE="marg">Martyrdome.</NOTE> it) being here or hard by (at or upon the third or fourth griece or step of the <HI>Pulpitum</HI> or ascent to the Presbytery or quire, as some will) murdered, martyred they call it, whence these verses, on each leafe of the doore one, yet legible in part.

<P>Here sometime stood an Altar, by the wall, where now D^r <HI>Chapman's</HI> monument is set up, commonly called <HI>Altare Martyrii Sancti Thomae.</HI> Which together with the place <HI>E|rasmus</HI> saw, and hath left it thus described <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Peregrinatio religionis ergo.</NOTE>. <HI>Illis</HI> (saith he) <HI>ostenditur altare ligneum Divae Virgini sacrum, pusillum, nec ulla re visendum, nisi monumento vetustatis luxum hisce tempo|ribus exprobrante.

A thing which they of Christ-Church could not of a long time digest, nor would they suffer the other in quiet with the purloyned reliques untill at length some amends was made them by that composition made between the two houses, passing over unto Christ-Church (in exchange for other elsewhere) those houses and ground beside their <HI>Campanile,</HI> whereof you may reade before: as <HI>Thorne</HI> comments on it, <HI>nobis</HI> (that is to S^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Austins) multum inutilis &amp; incommoda.</HI> But <HI>in callem regredior.</HI> This place (no doubt) was of high esteem with our Ancestors, the walls whereof seem to have been hangd, and was a place pickt out for the solemnity of <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. espousalls with his Queen <HI>Marga|ret,</HI> whereof I reade thus in the records of the Church <HI>Anno Dom. 1299. Quinto idus Septembris, Dominus Robertus Cant. Archiepiscopus celebravit sponsalia inter Dom. Edwardum Re|gem Angliae &amp; Margaretam sororem Regis Franciae in ostio ec|clesiae versus claustrum juxta hostium Martyrii Sancti Thomae.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady-chapell.</NOTE></P>
<P>I passe hence to the Chapell contiguous, commonly cal|led the Lady-Chapell, a piece not old; by the work, it should be much what about the age of Dunstan-steeple. <HI>In Anno Dom.</HI> 1452. I finde <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Antiq. Brit. in vita <HI>Stafford.</HI> pag. 289.</NOTE> it called <HI>Nova Capella beatae Mariae.</HI></P>
<P>I confesse I reade of the Lady-chapell long before. Archbishop <HI>Richard, Beckets</HI> immediate Successor, was bu|ried in it. But that Chapell stood within the old body of the Church, and was parcell of it. I have it from the Church records verified by the leaden Inscription and Pontificall reliques, to wit, his Cope, Crosier and Chalice lately found
<PB N="168" REF="104">
in digging D^r <HI>Anian's</HI> grave by S^t <HI>Iohn Boys</HI> his monument on the North side of the body, toward the upper end. That old Chappell was not heard of since the present body of the Church was built.</P>
<P>By the entry or <HI>testudo,</HI> under the greeces or steps (the <HI>pulpitum</HI> as wont to be called) leading up to the Quire, from the body, I proceed and come to S. <HI>Michaels</HI> Chapell, <NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Michaels</HI> Chapell.</NOTE> standing on the other (the South) side of the Quire. A Chapell indeed in name old. For Archbishop <HI>Langton</HI> in <HI>Hen.</HI> 3 dayes is storied <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Antiq. Prit. in ejus vita pag. 149.</NOTE> to have been there intombed. But the work of the building of the modern Chapell will not bear that age. I am therefore perswaded that the old one was fain to be taken down, whilest the body and crosse Iles of the Church were in building, to give better way to that work, and that that being finished, this was new built as now it is.</P>
<P>Ascend we now by the steps or <HI>Pulpitum</HI> to the Quire <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quire.</NOTE> (Chancell or Presbytery.) <HI>Ad hunc conscenditur multis gra|dibus,</HI> saith <HI>Erasmus:</HI> which whole work of the Quire, from end to end, I mean, from the Westerne doore thereof un|to the Archiepiscopall throne or marble Chair behinde the high Altar, with the side-iles, crosse-iles and other build|ings on both sides the Quire (the Quires curious Westerne doore-case onely excepted, built, I take it, about the time that the body was) together with the under-croft (or vaults) to them (except the Princes Chapell there) are much of an age; there is that harmonious symmetry and agreement betweene the parts. But certainly of what age I cannot define; onely confessing it farre elder then the Nave; I dare constantly and confidently deny it to be elder then the Norman conquest: because of the building of it upon Arches, a forme of Architecture though in use with and among the Romanes long before, yet after their departure not used here in England till the Normans brought it over with them (as I told you) from France. So that (I say) elder then the conquest this piece <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Vide pag. 113.</NOTE> cannot be, and I dare not pronounce it, the roof of it at lest|wise
<PB N="169" REF="104">
to be so old, because of the many combustions, beti|ding the fabrick since the Conquest. But by many induce|ments I am throughly perswaded that it is (for the main) the upper part of that new Church which <HI>Lanfranc</HI> first built, whereof I have treated sufficiently before. And so I have shortly done with the antiquity of this fabrick, the Quire.</P>
<P>Now a word or two of the Ornaments, and what else in it may worthily call for our speculation. To begin with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hangings.</NOTE> Hangings setting forth the whole story both of our Savi|ours life and death. They were given, one part of them by Prior <HI>Goldstone,</HI> and the other by <HI>Richard Dering</HI> the Church-Cellerar, in <HI>H.</HI> 8. dayes.

<DIV3 TYPE="sub-subsection">
<P>In the Church records I meet with Inferior and Superior <HI>chorus;</HI> and one <HI>Thomas Ingram</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by his will <NOTE PLACE="marg">1486.</NOTE> in the office gives <HI>cuilibet Monacho de Superiori choro ecclesiae Christi Cant.</HI> xij^d. <HI>&amp; cuilibet Monacho de inferiori choro ejusdem ecclesiae</HI> viij^d. Now as we see there are two rowes of stalls (an upper and a lower) on either side the Quire: so I conceive the seniors and superiors of the Monks used to sit in the up|per, as the juniors or inferiors in the lower row; and that thence sprang the name of the superior and inferior chorus.</P>
<P>Above these stalls on the South side of the Quire stands the Archbishops wooden seat or chaire, sometime richly guilt and otherwise well set forth, but now nothing speci|ous through age and late neglect. It is a close seat made after the old fashion of such stalls, called thence Faldisto|ria <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Glossar. <HI>D. H. Spelman.</HI> in hac voce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A little higher up, on the other side of the Quire, be|tween
<PB N="170" REF="105">
<HI>Chichlies,</HI> and <HI>Bourgchiers</HI> tombs was provision made heretofore for the storing and treasuring up of Saints re|liques. This Repository was shewed to <HI>Erasmus,</HI> who spends these words upon it. <HI>Ad latus Septentrionale</HI> (saith he) <HI>refe|runtur arcana, dictu mirum, quantum ossium illine prolatum est, calvaria, menta, dentes, manus, digiti, integra brachia, quibus omnibus adoratis fiximus oscula: nec erat futurus finis, nisi qui mihi tum comes erat ejus peregrinationis par&ugrave;m commodus, in|ter pellasset ostentandi sludium &amp;c</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Peregrin.

Hence <HI>Erasmus</HI> then be|held, as we may now, the Altars table and ornaments; in|deed (thanks to the piety of the times) very rich and beco|ming such dayes of blessed peace as our Church (by Gods mercy) now enjoyes, but not comparable surely to those that <HI>Erasmus</HI> saw, or else he much hyperboliseth, where he saith: <HI>Diceres Midam &amp; Croesum fuisse mendicos, si spectares vim auri atque argenti</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Erasm.</HI> ubi supra.</NOTE>. This Altar was and still is called the high Altar, more properly so, heretofore, then now, be|cause it was the chief one in the whole Church, Christs Al|tar, and to distinguish it from the Saints Altars, whereof the Church had many, 25. in number, one in the middest of the crosier between the nave and the Quire, a second in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Altars.</NOTE> Martyrdome, a third in the Lady-chapell, a fourth in S^t <HI>Michaels</HI> chapell, two in either wing of the Quire <HI>viz.</HI> in each semicircle there one, one in the Vestry, one in S^t <HI>An|selmes</HI> Chapell on the other side of the Quire, three neare unto the high Altar it self, whereof one was S^t <HI>Dunstans,</HI> a second S^t <HI>Elpheges,</HI> a third (and that standing behinde the high Altar) S^t <HI>Blases,</HI> two at least in <HI>Beckets</HI> Chapell, where|of one in the little side Chapell against <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. monument, and the other beyond the shrine, in the place called <HI>Beckets-</HI>crown, besides seven other in the undercroft, and two in the body of the Church which I had almost forgotten, whereof one was belonging to <HI>Arundels,</HI> and the other to <HI>Brenchlyes</HI> chantery there. One more there was, and that in the now Deanes-chapell.</P>
<P>But leaving these things and the Quire too, let us now <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beckets-</HI>chapell</NOTE> ascend. <HI>Post Altare summum rursus velut in novum templum
<PB N="171" REF="105">
ascenditur,</HI> saith <HI>Erasmus.</HI> To this I proceed, the upper part of the Church (I mean) from the grate between the Ar|chiepiscopall throne or marble chaire, by the Mosaick or Musaick-work <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Vide sit dict. vide <HI>Pancirol.</HI> par. prior tit. 23. &amp; <HI>Martin.</HI> Lexic. Philolo|gic. verb. Musi|vus.</NOTE>, upwards, called (from the standing of his Shrine there) <HI>Beckets</HI> Chapell: which, with the <HI>vertex</HI> of the work, called <HI>Beckets</HI> crown (intended by <HI>Erasmus,</HI> where he saith <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Peregrin. Relig. erg&ocirc;.</NOTE>, <HI>Illic in sacello quodam ostenditur tota facies op|timi viri inaurata multisque gemmis insignita &amp;c.)</HI> the either side-Iles, (except the Chapell on the North-side, and the undercroft of it) I hold to be somewhat lesse ancient then the Quire and it undercroft: The ocular and peeked or pointed form of the arch, the round marble pillars or co|lumnes both above and below (to passe by other disagree|ments easily observable) showing a manifest discrepancy and difference of one from the other. For truth is, about the place where the Quire ends and that Chapell begins (observe but the works above and underneath, and you will easily perceive it) the Church once ended, and ex|tended no further, the pillars and work coming on and clo|sing there.</P>
<P>The certain age of this part neither can I finde, but from great probability do conceive it to be that new work (whereof <HI>Edmerus</HI> speaks) begun and furthered by this Pa|tron) Archbishop <HI>Anselme,</HI> but continued and consumma|ted by <HI>Enulph</HI> the Prior with the help of his Monks in <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. time. A work that (as I told you erewhile) was so envi|ed of some about the King, and on the other side so much applauded and extolled by <HI>William</HI> the Monk of <HI>Malmes|bury,</HI> who for the windowes, pavement, and other orna|ments of it preferres it to any other in the whole kingdome. <HI>Nihil tale</HI> (saith he) <HI>possit in Anglia videri &amp;c.</HI> as before. Properties wherein it yet justly deserves the comparison.</P>
<P>Some haply may here ask me why <HI>Beckets</HI> crown, if it be <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beckets-</HI>crown.</NOTE> a piece so ancient, is so imperfect on the top? For answer unto them, I say, that time was when that piece was to the minde of the first founders complete, being built not alto|gether so high at first as now it is. The Monks (saith tra|dition)
<PB N="172" REF="106">
at the the time of the Dissolution were in hand (in honour of <HI>Becket)</HI> to have advanc'd the building to a high|er pitch, but their fall prevented that's rise. So that where|as before it had a handsome complete battlement, it is now a great blemish to the Church, and an eye-sore to specta|tors, by the ragged and imperfect ruines of it. This is that <HI>Corona Sancti Thomae,</HI> in beautifying whereof the Church Records tell me and I have before told you 115 <HI>lib.</HI> 12^s. was expended in <HI>Hen.</HI> the Priors time.</P>
<P>Now retreating let us take a view of the Vestry.

Consi|dering lastly, that the Priors ancient Gate, or the Gate of the Priory was and is, neare this Chapell, being the same which leadeth from the Green-Court into that which we now call the darke Entry, and so to the doore there now stopped up, the Timber-frame whereof is yet hanging on the things, and anciently lead into the Priors Cellar, as that other hard by it into his Chamber. All these things (I say) observed and considered, I am assured that this was S^t <HI>Thomas</HI> Chapell, otherwise <HI>Anno 16.

<P>Over this Chapell is the Church-library, not the same to the repaire whereof Archbishop <HI>Hubert</HI> gave the Church of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Library.</NOTE> <HI>Halstow,</HI> this being built (as erewhile I told you) by Arch|bishop <HI>Chichley,</HI> and borrowed from the Chapell, or super|added to it; the juniority of the worke, and the passage to it plainely intimate so much. It was by the founder and others once well stored with Bookes, but in mans memory shamefully robbed and spoiled of them all, an act much pre|judiciall and very injurious both to posterity, and the Com|mon-wealth of letters. The piety of the present Church|men hath begun to replenish it, and may it have (what it well deserves) many benefactors, to the perfecting of the faire beginning; with which wish I leave both it and the Chapell.</P>
<P>And now I shall desire you would take notice of the Windowes, especially in the Churches upper part, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Windowes.</NOTE> both for the glasse and Iron-worke thereof are well worthy

Besides, these Windowes affoord and offer to our view certaine verses containing a paralell of the old and new Testament.

<P>But enough of this. Returne wee to our Undercroft. Where, under the South-crosse Ile or wing of the Quire, was and still is (though not so used now) Prince <HI>Edw.</HI> Cha|pell. The story whereof take here from the relation of its <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blacke Prin|ces Chapell.</NOTE> estate given up to the Commissioners; these Emissaries
<PB N="177" REF="108">
sent to inquire and examine the state of all Chanteries, &amp;c. upon and according to the Stat. 37. <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 4. which tels that the said Chantery was founded in Christ-Church, in a place called the Undercroft in the yeare of our Lord God 1363. by the aforenamed Prince <HI>Edw.</HI> who with li|cence of his Father, King <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. purchased lands <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Fawkshall Mannor by</HI> London. Lib. eccles. Cane.</NOTE>, and made agreement with the Prior and Convent of Christ-Church for the contentation and stipend of two Chaplains: Ordeining S^r <HI>Iohn Steward,</HI> and S^r <HI>Nicholas de Lodington</HI> and their Successors for ever to receive yearely of the said Prior and Convent, forty markes above all charges of reparati|ons or otherwise. Also the said Prince <HI>Ed.</HI> gave to the said Chaplaines and to their Successors for ever, a house being in Saint <HI>Alphage</HI> Parish of the yearely value of xx^s. whereof 4^d. is yearely resolute to S^t <HI>Austins:</HI> the reparation whereof to be kept alwayes at the proper cost of the said P. and Co. of Christ-Church. Hence you may perceive the Founder and time of foundation of this Chapell. At or shortly after this relation given up, the Chap. formerly with grates and barres parted off from the rest of the Un|dercroft growing out of use and deserted, was laid open to it, and sithence (I take it) the double way beaten and made through the wall, for a passage, by that Chapell, to the French-Church there. I may not leave this Chapell before I have observed the roofe of it, a piece of newer and more curious worke then the rest of the Vaults about it, and yet the over built Structure as old as any that stands within the neighbour Vaults of elder-fashioned-worke. How this might be thus made, haply some will wonder. But their satisfaction is easie. For the elder Roofe of the Chapell (as it might well bee without indangering the Church) was undoubtedly taken downe, and that the Chapell might in all parts the better correspond and suite with the dignity and degree of the Founder, was rebuilt in that neate quaint manner that now it is.</P>
<P>Leaving now this Chapell, come we to the next, com|monly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady-Chapell.</NOTE> called the Lady <HI>Vndercroft,</HI> an edifice, since the

Dissolution and Reformation quite deserted also and de|spicable, but formerly so much celebrated, of such high esteeme, and so very rich, that the sight of it debarred to the vulgar, was reserved for persons onely of great qua|lity. <HI>Erasmus,</HI> who by especiall favour (Archbishop <HI>Warham</HI> recommending him) was brought to the sight of it, de|scribes it thus <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Pereg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n.

For indeed I never saw a thing more laden with riches. Lights being brought, we saw a more then Royall spectacle. In beauty it farre surpasseth that of <HI>Walsingham.</HI> This Cha|pell (as he addes) is not shewed but to Noble men, and especiall friends, &amp;c. The Chapell doubtlesse is ancient.</Q> For in the Church-Records I read of <HI>Altare beatae Mariae in Cryptis</HI> almost 400 yeares agoe, to wit in the yeare 1242, and againe in the yeare 1322. At what time the Altars in the Undercroft are recorded to be these: S^t <HI>Iohn</HI> the Bap|tist, S^t <HI>Thomas</HI> the Apostle, S^t <HI>Clement</HI> the Pope, S^t <HI>Kathe|rine</HI> the Virgin, S^t <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Bishop, S^t <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and S^t <HI>Mary</HI> the Virgin. If this word Altar amount not to prove it a Chapell: <HI>Capella</HI> (I am sure) it is called in the foundation of the Lady <HI>Mohunes</HI> Chantery, in the yeare 1397. long before Archbishop <HI>Mortons</HI> dayes, who some say was the founder of it.

This parcell of the Undercroft (a most godly Vault and rarely paraleld, and a place, heretofore untill <HI>Beckets</HI> shrine and Saint-ships ut|ter downefall and casheering, no doubt much set by, and celebrated) fell to the share of D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Bray</HI> his predecessors up|on the division of houses and places of accommodation for the Deane and Prebendaries, whereof I have often told you. Which is all I have to say of it (unlesse I should re|member the Altar once standing there, called <HI>Altare Tum|bae beati Thomae martyris:)</HI> and periods my Survey of the Churches Fabricke, both Crypticall and other, saving that in a word or two I must remember the Cloister and Chap|ter-house.</P>
<P>For the latter of which, questionlesse it is the same, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chapter-house</NOTE> which in Prior <HI>Chillendens</HI> time (as whilome was said) was new-builded; you may finde his name (as a benefactor) over the entrance, in the foote of the West-Window.

Hence the discipline here said to be inflicted on <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. for Archbishop <HI>Beckets</HI> mur|der, whereof our Stories tell <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Antiq. Brit. in ejus vita. pag. 138. <HI>Cloister.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As for the former (the Cloister, the keeping whereof, and so of the Refectory, the Dormitory and the Infirmary, very private, was cautiously provided for of Archbishop <HI>Winchelsey</HI> by his Statutes <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Liber <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ecee.

The South-pane or Quarter whereof, some|what more beautified then the other three, I take to be that which Archbishop <HI>Courtney</HI> (as was shewed before) tooke order by his Will to be made, and hath his Armes set up about the entrance to it at the West-end. As for the many other Armes thicke set about the Cloister, by the way, I suppose them to be theirs that were benefactors in their

time, either to the Church or Monastery, or both: where|of I perswade my selfe the number was not small, as may probably be argued from that one instance which Master <HI>Cambden</HI> gives of the new building of <HI>Crowland</HI> Abbey in <HI>Lincolnshire;</HI> whither I referre such as desire to know and learne, by what meanes such mighty huge and faire Reli|gious houses and buildings as these were raised in former times. And this shall suffice to have spoken of the Church.</P>
<P>Now to make my Survey compleate, I must another while play the <HI>Mystagogus,</HI> and shew you the Monuments, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monuments.</NOTE> purposely reserving them till now, because being many, and some of them yeelding length of discourse, they would have too much interrupted my Survey of the Fabricke, if I should have intermixt them with it. Here I intend not a recitall of every Monument I meet with, but chiefely of the more ancient ones; those of latter times, being either fresh in memory, or more easily knowne by the Inscripti|ons and Epitaphs cut in the grave-stones, then those of el|der times, either wanting Inscriptions <HI>ab initio,</HI> or else done in Brasse, which for the most part is either with age defaced, or the Brasse it selfe by wicked hands purloined. And not all of them neither will I set downe in this place, purposing to mention the Archbishops and Priors Monu|ments in their severall Catalogues.</P>
<P>And so I begin with the first (I meane, the lowermost) Monument in the body of the Church. Where is a very <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop <HI>Bokin|ghams</HI> Monu|ment.</NOTE> faire grave-stone with much of the Brasse yet remaining, and having almost all the Inscription or Epitaph still intire, saving (the principall) the interred parties name upon it. It begins thus. <HI>Hic jacet in requie&mdash;</HI>and there (the brasse being worne or rather torne away) breakes off. My dili|gence to inquire of the ancient retainers of the Church, whose Monument it was, could have no satisfaction. Yet at length one of them told me that the name was extant since his memory, which he said (as his memory served him) was either <HI>Bobingham</HI> or <HI>Robingham,</HI> or the like.

<P>The Church it self, with her appendent, annexed and connexed buildings thus throughly surveyed, my proposed method sends me to survey next the other ancient build|ings within the precinct of it and the Palace &amp;c. I begin with the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk, and the first Archbishop of this See <NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbishops Palace.</NOTE> and his associats, being kindely received of King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> and admitted into the City; for their present accommoda|tion were seated (as whilome was told you) first at Stable|gate, neare unto this Palace, where presently they beganne (saith venerable <HI>Bede</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Hist. eccles. lib. 1. c. 26.</NOTE>) <HI>vitam imitari Apostolicam.</HI> By which and other meanes at length converting the King to Chri|stianitie, and daily winning upon his favour; the King short|ly after removing and withdrawing himself and his Court
<PB N="187" REF="117">
to Reculver, and there setling, as his Successors in the Kentish Kingdome whilest it lasted ever after did, (as some report <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Antiq. Brit. in vita <HI>Augustini.</HI></NOTE>) bestowes upon his beloved <HI>Augustine</HI> (for a perpe|tuall seate for him and his Successors) his owne Roy|all Palace in the City, conceived to have stood much here|about. This Palace with the neighbouring Church, <HI>Augu|stine</HI> afterward converted both into a Cathedrall and a Mo|nastery, yet (as I take it) not dividing his dwelling or set|ting out his habitation apart from the Monkes; but, as he was to them considered as Cathedrall Canons, Bishop, and considered as Claustrall Monkes, Abbat, or in place of Ab|bat; and <HI>&egrave; converso,</HI> they to him considered as Bishop, Ca|thedrall Canons and Chapter, and considered as Abbat, a Convent of Claustrall Monkes: So he and they and both their Successors intercommuning, as in goods and posses|sions, so in one and the same habitation, of one intire pre|cinct ever after untill (I take it) <HI>Lanfrancs</HI> dayes. Who innovating and altering the most of our fashions, and for|mer usages in Church-affaires, and haply not digesting this amongst the rest, thought good (its like) to change it. For no mention of any such Palace or like severall habitati|on for the Archbishop, is to be found before his time. He indeed, amongst his other structures built him a Court or Palace distinct from the Monkes. <HI>Edificavit &amp; curiam sibi, &amp;c.</HI> saith <HI>Edmerus,</HI> speaking of the same Archbishop <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Hist. Novor. lib. 1. pag. 8.</NOTE>. He it was that first shifted and setled (in that manner that <HI>Doomsdayes</HI> Survey found them) the Mannors and Possessi|ons betweene himselfe and the Monkes; setting out to each of them and the Successors of them both their distinct and proper parts <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Lib. ecclesie Cant.</NOTE>: and so no marvell if he discommoned himselfe and his Successors by a Palace, <HI>per se,</HI> from the Monkes ever after. <HI>Lanfranc</HI> then (I am perswaded) first furnished the See with a Palace here. Whereof I thinke little or no part is left to be now surveyed: Neither Hall, Chapell, or other whole piece about it (I exclude the Hall where the Archbishops civill-Court is holden, which I shall shew was but of late laid to the Palace) being to my seeming of that Antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="118">
And no marvell: for this house (saith <HI>Lambert')</HI> by that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peramb. <HI>of Kent</HI> in Cant.</NOTE> time <HI>Hubert</HI> the Archbishop had aspired to the See, was decayed, either with age, or flame, or both. Who there|fore (saith he) pulled downe the most part of it, and in place thereof laid the foundation of that great Hall and other the Offices that are now to be seene. But by reason that himselfe wanted time (prevented by death) and some of his followers lacked money to performe the worke, it rested unperfect till the dayes of <HI>Boniface,</HI> who both sub|stantially and beautifully finished the whole; and yet (as some thinke) <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> had accomplished the great Hall thereof before him. Thus <HI>Lambert. Harpesfield</HI> is ex|presse for <HI>Langions</HI> building of the Hall. <HI>Egregiam illam</HI> (saith he <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastic. Hist. Saecul 13. Cap. 5 pag. 434.</NOTE>) <HI>Palatii Cantuariensis ille aulam aedificavit.</HI> For the rest, all or most of it is certainly much newer, as the work plainely discovers: whereof the present Gate-house (Iam told) was sometime used for the <HI>Lollards-</HI>Tower or Prison, and so called.</P>
<P>Thus my Survey of the Palace would shortly end, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great-Hall.</NOTE> that I may not let the Great Hall (a piece of goodly stru|ture) passe without some little digression and enlargement of my discourse touching the same, it being famous for ma|ny solemnities and celebrious assemblies there. Amongst the rest, for that of King <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. his Wedding feast kept there <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Stow.</HI> Annals in <HI>Ed.</HI> 1.</NOTE>. As also for that great state and solemnity of Arch|bishop <HI>Warhams</HI> intertainment both of the Emperour with his Mother, and the King and Queene of <HI>England,</HI> at a supper in the same Hall, and also of his owne entertain|ment there at his first coming and inthronization into the See; whereof his Successor (Archbishop <HI>Parker)</HI> and others make mention. And lastly for the intertainment there which the same Archbishop <HI>Parker</HI> gave the late Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the French Monsieur, the Duke of <HI>Rhetz,</HI> and many of the English Nobility. So much for the Pa|lace.</P>
<P>I come now to the Church-precinct: which how it lyes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Church-pre|cinct.</NOTE> and where it goes at this day, is a thing easily traced and
<PB N="189" REF="118">
found out, as thus. From the partition Wall betweene the Palace and it, neare the Rush-market to the Church-gate, and so directly upwards almost to Burgate, from thence by the Towne-Wall included to the Chancell-head of North|gate-Church, and from thence by the Almnary (or Mint-yard) Wall (crossing and taking in the way betweene the South-West corner of that Wall, and the opposite Palace Wall) to the Court-Gate, commonly called the Porters-Gate. Thus lyes the moderne precinct of the Church.</P>
<P>But time was when it lay otherwise, <HI>Lanfranc</HI> coming to the See; <HI>Omnes Officinas quae infra murum Curiae sunt, cum ipso muro aedificavit</HI> (saith <HI>Edmerus</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Hist. Novor. lib. 1. pag. 7.</NOTE>.) <HI>Si quis in praedicta eccle|sia</HI> (saith <HI>Theobald</HI> the Archbishop in a Charter of his) <HI>vel infra ambitum murorum ecclesiam &amp; curiam nostram &amp; mona|chorum cingentium, &amp;c</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Liber ecclesiae. Cant.</NOTE>. The Court and Church you see was sometimes walled in; the Church-yard was the like. For by a Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. the Monkes of the place had a way granted them, or rather restored, <HI>circa murum Cimi|terii sui tempore guerrae nuper sublat.</HI> (meaning, I take it, that which happened at the end of King <HI>Stephens</HI> reigne:) which the King chargeth <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Hamon</HI> the then <HI>Praepositi</HI> of the City to deliver them <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Liber ecclesie praedict.</NOTE>. Some remaines of this old Wall yet appeare, as at D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Causaubons</HI> a little remanent of it, and a larger parcell and of good height by the Covent or Com|mon-garden: whereby it appeares that this Wall stood some pretty distance from the Wall of the City. The in|terposed ground betweene which double Wall, not being then any parcell either of the Church demesnesse or liber|ty, lay partly in Northgate, partly in Burgate-Ward. That (I am sure) betweene Queningate and Burgate, called Queningate Lane, being in the Church-Records, before it came to the Monkes said to lye in <HI>Berthade Burgate,</HI> as I conceive it thence probable, the rest to have lyen in North|gate-Ward. Besides, within the moderne precinct, and that about the now Co. Garden, lay the best part of Saint <HI>Michaels</HI> Parish, and Queningate Parish betweene that and Queningate, within which Saint <HI>Austins</HI> Abbey, and di|vers
<PB N="190" REF="119">
private men beside sometimes had houses, land and other interest, as they had also lower downe on the South-side of the now Church-yard. I will therefore (as pertinent) shew how in time the Church became possessed of the whole precinct as now it is.</P>
<P>And first for the South-side of the Church-yard, I read thus <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Liber ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> memoratae.</NOTE>. <HI>Anno Domini</HI> Miij^o. <HI>Ethelredus Dux dedit ecclesia Christi particulam terrae in Dorobernia quam sibi rex Ethelredus dedit</HI> XV <HI>virgarum in longitudine, &amp;</HI> viij <HI>virgarum in lati|tudine. Termini terrae sunt hii. In orientali parte terra Regis. In parte australi placea civitatis. In occidente terra ecclesiae Christi. In Aquilone cimiterium Christi.</HI> This parcell of land must needs lye on the South-side of the Church-yard, the North and South bounds argue it so plainely. <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. by his Charter confirmes to <HI>Hugh,</HI> Abbat of Saint <HI>Austins,</HI> and to the Monkes there, <HI>Omnes illas terras quas Monachi S. Tri|nitatis eis dederunt pro excambio terrae quam ab eis receperunt ad amplificandum cimiterium suum, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> Abbey (as you may remember I told you) had sometimes also divers tenents, tenements and ground on the same quarter of the Church-yard, neare and behinde the <HI>Campanile</HI> or <HI>Clocarium</HI> of the Church, the ruined foundation whereof appearing now in the forme of a little Mount lyes inclosed in M^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Archdeacons Garden. These houses and lands in <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. time, and by his helpe, were obtained (upon exchange) of that neighbour Mona|stery, by the Monkes of this Church, as by what I have said hereof before, and by the composition made touch|ing the same, copied in my Appendix, may further ap|peare.</P>
<P>One <HI>Gervasius de Cornhill,</HI> whom that Composition (as you shall see) makes mention of, had divers tenements of his owne neere this <HI>Campanile,</HI> which the Church also a|bout the same time, and for the same reasons purchased of him, his sonne <HI>Reignald</HI> and <HI>Maud</HI> his Wife, exchanging for them certaine ground in Friday-street <HI>London,</HI> which together with the former exchange were confirmed by se|verall
<PB N="191" REF="119">
Charters of <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. to be seene in the Liegers of the Church. It seemes by the premisses that this <HI>Campanile</HI> did terminate both the Church-ground and liberty at this time. But after this double exchange I suppose those houses taken downe, and the ground there laid open unto the back|side of the row of shops along Burgate-street (Shops I call them, for such they were built for, and not for dwelling|houses, because, I take it, of fires, which the neighbour|hood of dwelling-houses might occasion to the Church; witnesse those by the Steeple, which we see were there|fore purposely gotten in and had away:) And the same ground being so dishoused and laid open, was made cimi|tery ground, and became part and parcell of the Church|yard, and so accounted. For the reason which the Prior and Covent render and show to Archbishop <HI>Winchelsey</HI> in <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. time, why they ought not to contribute to the repa|ration of Saint <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> Church in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in respect of their rents of those shops, was, that the same were <HI>infra limites Cimiterii ecclesiae Christi Cant. &amp; de manso Ecclesiae</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Liber ecclesiae memoratae.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hitherto of the Church-ground there.</P>
<P>Now for the ground betweene Northgate and Quenin|gate. This parcell came first to the Church in <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. time, and of his gift. For by his Charter extant in the Leigers of the Church, he gives to the Church, <HI>in augmentum elemo|sinariae suae</HI> (as the words of it are) <HI>placeam illam inter murum Civitatis &amp; murum qui claudit curiam Prioris &amp; monachorum, quae jacet inter Norgate &amp; Queningate. Quae quidem placea continet in fiue suo versus Or.</HI> xlj <HI>pedes in latitudine, &amp; versus Occiden.</HI> xxiiij <HI>pedes similiter in latitud. In medio sui</HI> xvij <HI>pedes, &amp; in longitudine</HI> lxxj <HI>perticas.</HI> In the yeare 1305. the Monkes are presented and charged by the Citizens to have stopped or made up the way betweene Queningate and Norgate: a thing confessed on the Monkes part, but de|fending themselves by this Charter, they are acquited <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Liber ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cant.</NOTE>. However for more surety (as I guesse) <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. afterwards by his Charter, grants them <HI>viam infra murum Civitatis Cantuar. quae ducere solebat de Northgate usque Queningate:</HI> as
<PB N="192" REF="120">
the Church-Records informe me. And so much also for that parcell of the now precinct.</P>
<P>For the rest of it thereabout, namely at and neere Que|ningate, and betweene it and Burgate, that is the ground knowne of late dayes by the name of the Co. Garden. I have seene <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">In Archivis ejusd. eccles.</NOTE> severall deeds, that shew how, by parcells, it became added to and inclosed within the Church-precinct. As first, the Church hath a Composition made by the Monkes of the place with their neighbours of Saint <HI>Austins,</HI> and dated in the yeare 1287. wherein many houses &amp;c. with|in Queningate, are (in exchange for other) passed over to the Church. <HI>De terris &amp; tenementis</HI> (so runnes the Deed) <HI>quae dicti Abbas &amp; Conventus habuerunt infra Queningate, viz.</HI> iij^s. viij^d. <HI>de duabus domibus Sacristiae suae, &amp;</HI> viij^d. <HI>de una vacua placeajacente &agrave; vico ibidem usque ad murum ecclesiae Chri|sti praed'. Item</HI> iiij^s. viij^d. <HI>redditus de quadam domo elemosinariae suae quam ibidem Aldhelmus tenuit simul cum una pecia terrae quam similiter ille Aldhelmus tenuit ibidem. Item</HI> xj^s. <HI>de tribus domibus Thesaurariae suae ibidem. Quae tenementa</HI> (marke this) <HI>&amp; redditus cum pertinentiis remaneant dictis Priori &amp; Capitulo &amp; eorum successor. libera &amp; quieta ab omni redditu &amp; servitio in feodum &amp; dominium &amp; tus ecclesiae suae in perpetuum.</HI> After|terwards. i. in the 41. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. I finde the two Monasteries come to Composition about certaine other houses and land situate and lying about this place. The preamble of the Indenture thus states the matter. <HI>Quod cum iidem Prior &amp; Conventus certa messuagia &amp; tofta de quibus iidem Abbas &amp; Conventus redditum</HI> xv^s. <HI>particulariter percipere consueverunt continentia in longitudine &amp; latitudine dimidiam acram, di|mid. rod. &amp; quartam partem unius rod. terrae, &amp; quae de Nico|lao Horne, Iohanne Calward, Henrico ate Forstall &amp; aliis in Queningate-lane separatim acquisiverunt, &amp; partem inde ca|lumpniarunt, &amp; residuum eorund. Messuag. &amp; Toftor. in aug|mentationem gardini ipsorum Prio. &amp; Conv. ibidem includere praetendunt, &amp;c.</HI> Thus you may perceive the Church-pre|cinct extending and spreading further and further. And this composition gave scope for it. For after that preamble
<PB N="193" REF="120">
it is yeelded by the Abbat and Covent of Saint <HI>Austins,</HI> what lay in them, that the Prior and Covent of Christ-Church, might at their pleasure inclose those messuages and ground.</P>
<P>After this came yet another parcell of the ground there|abouts to the Church. For I meete with a Deed or Char|ter of <HI>Ralph Broughton</HI> and <HI>Iohn Tent</HI> Chaplaines, made to the Church 16. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. (amongst other things) of one Messuage in the Parish of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> neare Quenegate, and of one Acre of Land in the same Parish neare Quenegate-lane: The house holding of the King. in Burgage, and the Land of Saint <HI>Austins</HI> for x^s. rent <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>By this time (I take it) the Church had gotten in all the ground hereabouts, saving what lay betweene Queningate and Burgate, a slip called Queningate-lane. Now for that, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Queningate-lane.</NOTE> I finde that by an Act of Parliament. 1. <HI>Rich.</HI> 3. (by which the Aldermanry of Westgate was granted to the City) the same parcell of ground, together with the Posterne and Bridge, was granted to the Church. But in case of eviction of the Aldermanry from the City, the slip of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aldermanry of Westgate.</NOTE> ground and premisses was to returne to the City, a part of whose demesnesse it was in Fee-ferme. And surely so it did; for in the 1. <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. the same Aldermanry, by a like Act of Parliament was restored to S^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>George Brownes</HI> heires, who by the former Act were made incapable of it, for their Father taking part with <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. against <HI>Rich.</HI> 3. But yet at length, after all this, by a composition betweene the Church and the City, made <HI>Anno 7. Hen.</HI> 7. the Church be|comes ever after quietly seized both of the same ground and Wall, with the Towers, Posterne, and Bridge.</P>
<P>Thus have I shewed you (as neere as I thinke it may be found) the extent of the ancient precinct, and how and when it became enlarged to that bignesse that now it beares. And so much of the precinct in generall.</P>
<P>I come now to the survey of the particular ancient buil|dings <NOTE PLACE="marg">Church-Gate.</NOTE> in and about the same, beginning with the Church-gate.
<PB N="194" REF="121">
A very goodly, strong and beautifull structure, and of excellent artifice, built in the yeare 1507. as appeares by this now scarcely legible inscription on the Gates-Front. <HI>Hoc opus constructum est Anno Domini Millesimo, Quingentesi|mo septimo. Thomas Goldstone</HI> the Junior, as I may call him, there being two (and he the latter) of that name, being then Prior, and (as he was famous for his piety that way) this workes great benefactor. A new Gate it is, and not the first (I take it) was builded there, but succeeding a former standing where this doth. For that which is now Alderman <HI>Nicholsons</HI> dwelling house, is anciently. i. 41. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. descri|bed <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Charta in lib. Hosp de <HI>Est|bridge.</HI></NOTE> to stand <HI>ante portam ecclesiae sanctae Trinitatis:</HI> the most ancient Gate standing higher up, somewhat neerer Burgate, a good part whereof is yet remaining, but built up, and converted to private use. This (I suppose) is that <HI>vetus portacimiterii</HI> the old Records of Christ-Church so often mention, the opposition of it to that which is now Master <HI>Fidges,</HI> and the other contiguous houses to his being Church-houses, serving to bound out and describe their situation in the ancient Rentalls, calling them <HI>Magna do|mus contra veterem portaem cimiterii.</HI> I have done with this Gate.</P>
<P>By which entring the Church-yard, and walking up to|wards <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimitery-Gate.</NOTE> the Covent Garden, on the right hand, within the Cimitery-Gate there (so called, I take it, because it had Cimitery ground lying on either side of it, that within it be|ing called <HI>Interius cimiterium)</HI> I finde yet standing the old Schoole-house, now put to other use, but (I am assu|red) that which was the Schoole-house, before the present <NOTE PLACE="marg">Schoole-house.</NOTE> Shoole-house in the Mint-yard.

<P>Of this Schoole the Archbishop <HI>sede plena;</HI> and the Church, <HI>sede vacante,</HI> were patrons. The Archbishops right will appeare unto you from those Records.

<P>The next thing falling under my Survey are certaine old <NOTE PLACE="marg">Honors.</NOTE> buildings called Honors or the Honors; in the apportion|ment of dwellings amongst the first Deane and Preb. by that name divided and shared betweene the predecessors of Doctor <HI>Ieffery,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Vossius</HI> now Prebends. With Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Cowells</HI> helpe, I understand the terme; but how to apply it, or how it may suite with the present buildings I know not: Unlesse in that the late Pri|ory of Christ-church being a Barony, and the Prior there, in right of his dignity, one of the spirituall Barons of the Parli|ament, those buildings (sometime the prime part of his seat) might specially appertain unto him in right of the Ba|rony, or be annexed to the Honor of the Barony, and thence take the name of Honors. Their name occurres not to me in any Record of the Church before this Division, else haply I could have said more of it, and with more certainty.</P>
<P>A step or two further brings me to the ruines of that building which in the Division is called the Fermary-Chapell. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fermary-Cha|pell.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Capgrave</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Quem refert Author Antiq. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> vita <HI>Cut|berti.</HI></NOTE> tells of a Chapell which he calls S^t <HI>Iohns</HI> stand|ing almost contiguous to Christ-Church, built by <HI>Cuthbert</HI> the Archbishop, amongst other intents, for a place of buri|all for him and his Successors, and that he was therein inter|red.
<PB N="197" REF="122">
Hence, and because of the Statue or effigies of S^t <HI>Iohn</HI> (as they suppose it to be; though S^t <HI>Iohn,</HI> I take it, is no where pictured with a long beard and like an old man, but there) with S^t <HI>Iohns, Ecce major me &amp;c.</HI> in part yet legible up|on an open scrowl in his hand (though in a charactter I dare say lesse ancient then the Conquest:) and from the neare site of it to the great Church, some are of opinion that this was that S^t <HI>Iohns</HI> Chapell <HI>Capgrave</HI> speaks of. By their fa|vour I think not. For first, granting for truth, that there sometimes was such a Chapell, and we have barely <HI>Cap|graves</HI> testimony for it (somewhat a weak ground to build upon;) yet I cannot imagine that so much as is yet standing of this Chapell could survive and stand out so many Da|nish inrodes, devastations and other combustions as have betided this place since <HI>Cuthberts</HI> dayes. Besides, <HI>Capgrave</HI> that tells of the beginning and foundation, withall straight|way shows the end and overthrow of that Chapell where he sayes. <Q>But this Church of S^t <HI>Iohn</HI> many ages since, to|gether with Christ-Church, and the offices thereof exchanged her substance with fire. Of the repaire or reedifying whereof I never read.</Q> Some supposing this and that other part of ancient building that is below it West-ward, to have been one intire structure, and to have had dependance one upon the other, do conceive it to have been the Church of S. <HI>Trinitie</HI> which Archbishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI> built. Indeed the arched or embowed work of it inclines my belief that it was a building erected since the Conquest. But others will have it to be the remaines of the old Church of S^t Saviour, that was built and standing before the Con|quest, that haply which <HI>Agelnoth</HI> the Archbishop in King <HI>Knutes</HI> time, after the former was destroyed and burnt by the Danes, reedified. But by their favour, it was neither this, that, nor tother. Truth is, as there is an upper and a lower part of this building, so was each part a distinct stru|cture by it self, and not one intire piece, the lower<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> West|ern part whereof was sometime a Hall, for the pulling down whereof there passed a decree in Chapter <HI>anno</HI> 1545. whence
<PB N="198" REF="123">
in the Division the very next yeare following it is called the late long Hall. And the upper or Eastern part of the building was this very Fermary or Infirmary-Chapell. The same Division calls it so, and that in regard-it did sometime appertain and was appropriate to those of the Infirmary or Infirmitory (the <HI>Nosocomium</HI> I may call it) of the Min|ster situate by it, consisting chiefly of an Hall or Refecto|ry, for their common board or table (if able and fit to come to it, otherwise feeding in their chambers) a kitchin to dresse their necessary provision in, a Dormitory or Dortor for their place of sleep and repose, distributed into certain distinct and severall chambers; of which, that one might not disturb another, every of the infirme folk had one proper to himself. And a private Chapell for their devoti|ons, who either were sick and could not, or diseased and might not accompany their brethren in their more pub|lick and common devotions in the Temple. D^r <HI>Langworth</HI> a late Predecessor of D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Blechynden</HI> (as it is noted down in a Chapter book) <HI>anno</HI> 1579. took down a crosse wall between his house and D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Lawses</HI> (a Predecessor of D^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Brayes)</HI> at the Churches charge, and paved the way between them with the stone. In all likelihood it was the Western wall of this Chapell, or the wall which terminated the Chapell West|ward, a cleare argument of the disjunction and separation thereof from that other lower part of building.

This Infirmary or <HI>domus Infirmorum</HI> I reade of in our Chronicles in King <HI>Iohns</HI> time. For the Monks of this Church quitting the Monastery by command of the King sorely offended at them, for their choice of <HI>Stephen Lang|ton</HI> for their Archbishop; 13 sick Monks which could not remove, were left behinde (saith my Author <NOTE N="v" PLACE="marg">Matt. Paris. pag. 299.</NOTE>) <HI>in domo In|firmorum.</HI> The same had a bath at or neare the entrance of it, haply the leaden cistern yet remaining, of what use you may gather from the Decrees of <HI>Lanfranc</HI> in <HI>Reyners</HI> book. Archbishops <HI>Winchelsey's</HI> Statutes <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Liber ms. Ec|cles. Cant.</NOTE> also mention it, which have provided many things touching the place. Amongst the rest, that as a place of great secrecy, no secu|lar should be admitted into it to view or see it. And that the Prior of the Church should, if not twice, yet at least once a week personally visit and view the place, to see that there be nothing wanting to the sick there, nor ought else amisse, or if so, to see it reformed. It had a speciall Cura|tor beside, who was called <HI>Infirmarius.</HI> But let us hence.</P>
<P>Of ancient buildings the next unto this is the Dortor, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dortor.</NOTE> the common Dormitory for the Monks, a very old piece, as any now stands (I beleeve) within the precinct. Here the Monks (according to S. <HI>Benets</HI> rule) slept <HI>vestiti.</HI> i. in their clothes, their regular habit, lying in the woollen, and without either sheet or shirt. Would you know why? Part|ly (I take it) to further them in the way of Mortification of their bodies, and partly for their more readinesse to attend their Nocturnes, that is, their night Devotions, which in imitation of the Primitives, they observed at certain of their Canonicall houres. To prevent disturbance this place <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ms. memorat.</NOTE> had two Vigils or Watchmen that guarded it every night; the one till midnight, the other till break of day. By Arch-Bishop <HI>Winchelsey's</HI> Statutes, no woman or stranger might by any meanes have accesse thither.</P>
<P>Neare unto this Dortor, are the ruines of the Kitchen, Pantry, Larder, and other like rooms or offices built for the common use and service of the Covent in point of food and repast, which was served in to them in their Common
<PB N="200" REF="124">
Hall or Refectory built contiguous to the Kitchen (the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Refectory.</NOTE> Remaines whereof show it to have been a very goodly, large and curious piece of structure) opening on the South|side with a faire doore into the Cloister, before which doore sometimes stood a double cistern, partly (I take it) for the service of the Hall, and partly as a layer used at that Ceremony of washing the hands and feet of the Monks by the chief Prelate or Superintendent by our Saviours ex|ample towards his Disciples, commanded by S^t <HI>Benets</HI> rule at certain times, especially at their Mandy, to be observed <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><HI>Decreta</HI> Lan|franci <HI>&amp; caeri|moniale</HI> Bene|dictin.</NOTE> This Hall they called the <HI>Fratria,</HI> in old English the <HI>Frater</HI> (so the Division calls it) because it was the common place of resort and meeting for the Fraternitie to their repast served into them from the contiguous Kitchen. Their or|dinary fare and food here was fish and fruits, where they were not more commonly and constantly served in, then flesh was rarely or never. Abstinence from which being, as to all sorts of Monks in generall, so to these in particular expressely enjoyned, and strictly imposed, the common Refectory might upon no terms admit of or affoord any. But were any of the family sick, it was to be had for him in the Infirmary. The guests likewise in the <HI>Cella Hospitum</HI> (the guessing chamber I may call it) were not denied it: and besides, the Prior (to whose conscience and discretion in this behalf much was left) if he saw cause to refresh any one or more with the flesh at his own table in his private chamber, he might call unto him thither now and then such as he thought fit. Thus and in these cases and places flesh might be at any time, and was many times eaten. But within the publick Refectory never, and that (as I con|ceive) because of the rules violation in that behalf, which these specialties were so farre from infringing, that like as exceptions do a generall rule, they rather con|firmed the same in the generality of it. For as in point ei|ther of the office or other like agends in the Church, or of rest and repose in the Dortor, by observing the rules (that is, the rites and customes) of the Monasterie in those cases
<PB N="201" REF="124">
in the places proper thereunto, the Church and Dortor; by the generality of the Monks, the rule in those cases was conceived and construed to be kept and fulfilled: So like|wise by observing the Monastick rules and customes for food and repast (and particularly this of abstinence from flesh) in the Refectory, the proper place of common refe|ction to the whole Convent in generall, the rule in that case was by common intendment kept unviolated. And that it might be so, it was (no doubt) one main end of de|vising and erecting these common Refectories. For might the Monks have been allowed their particular Cells, and a <HI>Praebenda,</HI> or portion set them out wherewith to finde themselves, and provide them of their own commons, as our Prebendaries now have, it might justly be feared that the rule in this point of abstinence from flesh, would be ei|ther not at all, or nothing so well observed, as in the com|mon and publick Refectory, where each one saw what his fellow ate. The consideration whereof probably moved <HI>Wlfred</HI> the Archbishop of this Church 800 yeers ago and up|wards (when by his Codicill he allowed the then Monks of this place their proper Cells, or houses) to provide that the having of them should not excuse nor hinder their re|sort to the Church, for prayers and other like agends there, at their canonicall houres, from the common Refectory for their boord, nor from the common Dormitory for their bed. As you shall finde by the Charter it self (if you peruse it) in my Appendix <HI>Scriptura</HI> 36. The Latine is much to blame, and the sense somewhat imperfect and incoherent, but I thought it not fit, nor my part to vary from it in the least syllable.</P>
<P>Of this Hall and the provision for the same and the or|dering thereof, the chief care and oversight was intrusted to the Cellerar one of the foure great <HI>Obedientiarii</HI> (or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cellerar.

consisted in the care of <HI>vestitus</HI> or clothing for the Monks, and therefore he had the charge of the <HI>Sartrinum</HI> and <HI>Su|trinum,</HI> the store-houses of that sort of provision, as I guesse by officers and retainers to them, such as these <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Lib.

Accord|ingly, at the setling of the Churches Mannors by Arch|bishop <HI>Lanfranc</HI> some were assigned and allotted to the feeding, other to the clothing of the Monks: as you shall finde by the distinction which is observed in the recitall of those Mannors in Doomsday book, where some are said and set down to appertain to the Monks <HI>ad cibum,</HI> other <HI>ad ve|stitum.</HI></P>
<P>By the way will you heare a learned mans opinion of this distinction of Monastick Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and assigning out unto them their peculiar ferms and revenues? <HI>Non est dubium</HI> (saith <HI>Roverius</HI> in his Illustrations of the History of <HI>S.

<P>First it stood and stands most conveniently for the pur|pose, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> being by the Court-Gate, remote from the Mona|stery which strangers were not to pry into. And Archbishop <HI>Winchelsey</HI> his Statutes <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lib. Ms. eccles. Cant.</NOTE> making mention of the place, seeme to intimate the standing of it within the Court. <HI>Item aula Hospitum &amp; paralitorium &amp; quaecunque officia ac domus ex|terioris curiae, &amp;c.</HI> Say the same Stat.</P>
<P>Secondly the Cellerar had charge of it. Now the Pen|tice or Entry betweene the Court-Gate and his Hall did (as <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> it were) make them meete.</P>
<P>Thirdly the present building was not onely a Hall, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> divided (as appeares by it) into an Hall and a Chamber (or Parlor) so to accommodate the intertained guest with both Bed and Boord, and what doe the same <HI>Winch.</HI> Statutes call it but <HI>Aula Hospitum &amp; Paralitorium?</HI> as you see be|fore.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge to have received some light also in this matter from the following story. A Keeper of Prince <HI>Edwards</HI> Ward-Robe (say the Records of the Church) in the great North-Hall of the Court, in the yeare 1304. kills another man within the precinct, and flyes streight way to the Chamber of the Hall, and though he were re|quired by the Steward of the Church, refuseth to come forth, or to suffer any to enter. Whereupon the Prince being consulted, another Keeper is sent downe, and order given to have the malefactor brought to his triall by a pre|fixed time. In the interim the Justices in a Sessions holden <HI>ante portam castri Cant.</HI> inquire of the murder and finde it.
<PB N="207" REF="127">
Shortly after the malefactor is brought before some Judges <HI>regia placita tenentibus</HI> in the Archbishops Palace, where it being demanded of him how he would or could acquit himself, he answers that being a Clerk, he cannot <HI>sine Or|dinario suorespondere:</HI> whereupon, being first found guilty of the fact by the Jury, he is, as convicted, delivered over to the Ordinary, and sent to the Archbishops Gaole at Maidstone. Thus goes the Story. Now I collect from hence that the Prince himself had been received here, and intertainment affoorded to his wardrobe after his de|parture; a use sutable to the condition of the place in hand. By this time (I trow) you see enough to perswade your beleef of this building to have been the <HI>Aula</HI> and <HI>Camera Hospitum.</HI> And now knowing what it was I shall next ac|quaint you with what I further reade concerning it in the Church-records.</P>
<P>The Hall had her p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oper and peculiar Steward; who, under the Cellerar, was to see to the accommodation of the guests with all necessaries according to the Statutes and Customes of the Monastery. He was called <HI>Senescallus au|lae Hospitum.</HI> Here was intertainment to be had of charity, for religious and secular guests, and that (by the Statutes of Archbishop <HI>Winchelsey)</HI> for the space of at least a day and a night: horse and man. On the top or by the foot of the Staire-case of stone vaulted underneath, anciently hung a gate, whereof (it seems) there was a constant keeper, who had his chamber hard at hand. For in the yeare 1382. I finde the Prior and Covent make a donation <HI>Custodiae portae interioris juxta aulam Hospitii servienti &amp; armigero suo, cum camera dicti Custodis &amp;c.</HI> So mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h of this pile.</P>

</LIST>
<P>FOr the first (the Antiquity of Archbishops, &amp;c.) I shall not need take much paines to search it out. For truth is, the Antiquity both of the name and office of an Archbi|shop is already so fully laid downe and proved to my hand by the worthily admired Author of the Defence of the answer to the Admonition, and so vindicated and cleered from the aspersion of Antichristianisme (wherewith some late turbulent Innovators have beene pleased falsly to stig|matize
<PB N="224" REF="136">
them) and by his learned pen, who fetcheth and deriveth them (so venerable is their Antiquity) from before the time of the Gospell publike embracing by any Prince, or in any Kingdome, and (if I mistake him not) the Office, though not the Name, from the Apostolike times; and Bishop <HI>Bilson</HI> also, Bishop <HI>Downham,</HI> and many others, as the learned well know, have so laboured in this argu|ment, that if I shall further proceed in the observing of the Antiquity of Archbishops, I shall but, as it were, <HI>actum agere.</HI> And therefore will it suffice that <HI>remissiv&egrave;,</HI> I referre the reader to these mens Learned Labours, whom I have chosen to cite, because the vulgar, whose onely informati|on I here intend, can more easily both purchase and peruse them, their workes like themselves speaking English. The learned, I know, can further satisfie themselves in the point from <HI>Bertherius</HI> in his <HI>Pithano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Morinus</HI> of late, in <HI>Ecclesiasticae Exercitationes,</HI> not to mention divers others. Of the former also, he may see those men answered, who (relishing nothing but a <HI>Presbyterian-Vtopian parity</HI> in the Ministery) under the pretence of zeale for the Reformati|on (as they terme it) of disorders in the Church-govern|ment by Archbishops &amp;c. kick and carpe at the same, and upon occasion which un-offered they take of the report of those, who to shew the originall of Archbishops in the Church, say that they succeeded in the places of the <HI>Archi-flamines</HI> (certaine heathen High-Priests, or Arch-Priests, which had the oversight of the manners of the <HI>Flamins,</HI> heathen Priests likewise, as Judges over them: of whom <HI>Duarenus</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Tract. de Bene|ficiis.</NOTE> , <HI>Alexander ab Alexandro</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Genial.

Monum.</NOTE> <HI>Fox</HI> with others make mention) collect and conclude thus. <Q>That the ministery of the Gospell was framed by example of idolatrous and heathenish functions. Of my</Q> fore-cited Authors the Defender of the Answer to the Admonition chiefely takes these men to taske. After what manner he encountreth their arguments would be too pro|lix here to relate, and because his larger discourse is, in my opinion well abridged and epitonized by M^r <HI>Mason:</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="136">
I have chosen rather to present you with these words of his. <HI>Sed id demum</HI> (saith he <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">De Ministerio Anglican. lib. 2. cap. 3. pag. 79.</NOTE>) <HI>illos pessim&egrave; habet qu&ograve;d Epi|scopi nostri atque Archiepiscopi sedes suas ad Flaminum atque Archiflaminum Ethnicorum numerum aptatas habuisse dicuntur. verum quid obsecro inde nascetur incommodi, si pulsis Idolorum cultoribus, veri Dei adoratores succedunt? Neque enim ulli loci Episcopatibus erigendis aptiores quam maxima &amp; frequen|tissimae Givitates. Ipsi Apostoli in nobilissimis urbibus in quibus fuerant, aliquando Flamines &amp; Archiflamines aut sacrorum Praesides corum non dissimiles Episcopos constituerunt, &amp;c.</HI> Thus farre M^r <HI>Mason.</HI></P>
<P>Some learned men (I am not ignorant) there have beene and are, which will by no meanes yeeld, that the Sees of our Bishops and Archbishops were adapted to the number and places of the Flamins and Arch-flamins, arguing very stifly against it, by name Bishop <HI>Godwin</HI> in his Treatise <HI>of the Conversion of Britannie,</HI> preceding his Catalogue of Bishops, <HI>Fol.</HI> 26. and some others. But put case it be gran|ted that they were so, and let these Cavillers (which dista|sting our <HI>Aristrocracy</HI> (for such is our Church governe|ment <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Downings</HI> Dis|course Con|clus. 1. &sect;. 6.</NOTE>) and desirous, as it seemeth, of an <HI>Anarchy,</HI> a Church like to <HI>Plinies Acephali,</HI> all body and no head) be allowed their so much desired premisses; yet still a <HI>non sequitur</HI> will attend on their conclusion. For were it (think they) a good collection to say that because there is now a Minister of the Gospell placed, where in the Popes time there was a massing Priest: <HI>Ergo</HI> the Ministery of the Gospell is fra|med by the example of massing Priests? If they cannot justly say so of Ministers, neither can they of Bishops and Archbishops. For the reason is the same in both. As much to this purpose the said Author of the Defence &amp;c. hath it <HI>Fol.</HI> 321. Agreeable whereunto is that of Bishop <HI>Hall</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Apology a|gainst Brow|nists. Sect. 46.</NOTE>. <HI>Christianity</HI> (saith he) <HI>came in the roome of Iudaisme, was it therefore derived from it?</HI> I leave the judicious reader to give the answer.</P>
<P>And so enough of this, onely pray we that <HI>Anarchy</HI> ne|ver get possession of our Stage, lest Confusion shut up the

The cause of their first Institution followes. And it was briefely this. As the whole <HI>Hierarchie</HI> was first invented and instituted, <HI>ut Augustae illius ac divinae Civitatis, quam ecclesiam vocamus, unitas ac tranquillitas melius conservetur. So Duarenus</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Desacr. eccles.

This the often alleaged Author of the Defence, &amp;c. well knowing, saith, that it is the chiefe and principall office of an Archbishop, <HI>To keepe Vnity in the Church, to compound contentions, to redresse heresies, schismes, factions, &amp;c.</HI> as he gathereth out of Saint <HI>Cyprian,</HI> as you may read <HI>Fol.</HI> 355.

three principall Cities of the Realme (as <HI>Fox</HI> and <HI>Lambert</HI> affirme) were before <HI>Lucius</HI> time, and in his reigne also untill his conversion, three Arch-flamins, who were by <HI>Fugatius</HI> or <HI>Faganus,</HI> and <HI>Damianus</HI> or <HI>Dimianus</HI> (teachers or Preachers sent by <HI>Eleutherius</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> into this Iland for the conversion of the King and people there|of) turned into Archbishops, about the yeare of our re|demption 180.

I reade, that <HI>Euaristus</HI> the first Bishop of Rome, who suffered martyrdome under <HI>Trajan</HI> the Em|perour, about the yeare 110. did the like in Rome. And <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pet. Greg.

His arguments you may finde examined and answered by his Animadversioner, to whom for brevity-sake I referre you, and come to the History of the Councell of Trent, the Author whereof delivers his opinion in the generalitie of the point in hand thus. <Q>The division of Parishes (saith he <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lib. 6. pag. 498.</NOTE>) was first made by the people, when a certain number of inhabitants, having received the true faith, built a tem|ple for exercise of their Religion, hired a Priest and did constitute a Church, which by the neighbours was called a Parish; and when the number was encreased, if one Church &amp; Priest were not sufficient, those who were most remote did build another. In progresse of time, for good order and concord a custome began to have the Bishops consent also. Thus he.

<HEAD>Cuthbert. 11.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Cuthbert</HI> was his Successor. This man was the first that obtained Church-yards for this Kingdome. For you must <NOTE PLACE="marg">742.

<PB N="232" REF="140">
passengers in minde of their mortality) upon the top or at the feet of mountains. And this kinde of interrement by generall custome was used both of Jewes and Gentiles, as you may finde at large illustrated by <HI>Wever</HI> in his Monu|ments. Hence was it that <HI>Augustine</HI> the first of our Archbi|shops procured the ground, on part whereof he afterward erected his Abbey, lying without the City, for a place of sepulture for the Kings of Kent, himself and all succeed|ing Archbishops of that See.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> making mention of this law, gives this reason for it. <HI>Credo</HI> (saith he) <HI>vel propter ignem, vel periculum.</HI> But <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Wever.</HI> Of ancient funer-Monuments <HI>pag.</HI> 7.</NOTE> <HI>Hospinian</HI> out of <HI>Durand, Vlpian</HI> and others, shewes the rea|son of it more at large. It was a custome (saith he) in times of old that men and women were buried in their own pri|vate houses or gardens; but afterwards for the noisome savour and contagious stink of the dead carcasses so inter|red, it was inacted that all burialls should be without Towns and Cities, in some convenient place appointed for that purpose. And however that this order was observed by the Gentiles upon this reason onely, <HI>scilicet ut in urbibus mundi|cies servaretur, et aer minus inficeretur, ex cadaverum putre|scentium foetore;</HI> yet the true Christians, and such as by their lively faith were adopted the children of God, had a fur|ther mystery in this their manner of interrments: for by the carriage and buriall of the dead corps without their City-walls, they did publikely confirme and witnesse, that the parties deceased were gone out of this world to be made free denizens of another City, namely Heaven, there to remain with the blessed Saints in eternall happi|nesse.</P>
<P>This order or custome of buriall without cities continu|ed amongst the Christians untill the time of <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great, for as then the Monks, Friers and Priests (saith my foresaid Author) began to offer sacrifice for the souls de|parted. So that for their more ease and greater profit, they procured first that the places of sepulture should be adjoyn|ing unto their Churches. Upon this reason out of the said

<HI>Gregory</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">13. quaest. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> c. xvij.</NOTE>. <HI>Cum gravia peccata non deprimunt</HI> (saith he) <HI>tunc prodest mortuis si in ecclesiis sepeliantur: quia eorum proximi quoties ad cadem sacra loca veniunt suorumque sepulturam aspi|ciunt, recordantur &amp; pro eis Domino pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ces fundunt.</HI> Ancient|ly (saith <HI>Onuphrius Panvinius</HI>) the bodies of the dead <NOTE PLACE="marg">In lib. de Rit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> sepeliendi mor|tuos.</NOTE> were buried onely without Cities in coemiteries or sleeping places (as the word signifies) untill the resurrection. But persecution being ended, and peace given to the Christian Church, the manner grew in use to bury within Cities, at the entrance into their sacred Temples, yea and afterwards in the very Churches themselves. Now our Archbishop <HI>Cuthbert</HI> happening to be at Rome, and seeing of these bu|rialls, obtained from the Pope a dispensation for the ma|king of Coemiteries or Churchyards within Townes or Cities throughout England.</P>
<P>By this time you may see when the old custome of bury|ing without City-walls ceased, and buryingin Churches and Church-yards both here and elsewhere began, and may guesse at the cause of the frequency of burialls in Churches in former times.

This our Arch|bishop perceiving his end to approach made his Will, and gave all his goods unto the poore: and dying was buried in his own Church, in the South-part of S. <HI>Thomas</HI> Cha|pell, in a marble Tomb joyning to the wall (saith Bishop <HI>Godwyn)</HI> and accordingly there hangs a table lately made, of him and his acts.

<HEAD>Thomas Becket. 38. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno Dom. 1161.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>Whose whole story our Chronicles and tradition withall have made so trite and vulgar, that lest I be checked with a <HI>Nil dictum quod &amp;c.</HI> I forbear to relate it, onely I shall desire to say somewhat of his buriall, translation and shrine, and to shew what the quarrell was he so stoutly (stub|bornly I should say) defended.</P>
<P>Being most barbarously murthered, upon Tuesday the 28 of <HI>December</HI> 1170. his body was buried first in the Un|dercroft. But the revolution of 50 yeares, having brought about his Jubilee (to wit in the yeare 1220:) and being first matriculated by the Pope a glorious Saint and Martyr; his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beckets</HI> Tran|slation.</NOTE> body with great solemnity, was taken up and laid in a most sumptuous shrine at the East end of the Church, at the
<PB N="246" REF="147">
charge of <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> his Successor, whereof I reade as followeth. <HI>Adveniente igitur translationis die, praesente maxi|m&acirc; multitudine tam divitum quam pauperum; Pandulphus Apo|stolicae sedis Legatus, Cantuariensis &amp; Remensis Archiepiscopi, Episcopique atque Abbates quamplurimi, cum Comitibus &amp; Ba|ronibus praedictam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">apsam, praesente Rege Henrico tertio, super humeros suos susceperunt, &amp; in loco quo nunc honoratur cum omni gaudio collocaverunt.</HI></P>
<P>The solemnity of this Translation happened upon or about the 7^t^h of <HI>Iuly.</HI> Hence (I take it) the occasion and originall of our (as we call it) <HI>Beckets</HI> Fair at <HI>Cant.</HI> begin|ning to be holden annually on the 7^t^h of that moneth. <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Faire.</NOTE></P>
<P>For, as S^r <HI>Hen. Spelman</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Glossar.</HI> in verb. Feri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> is of opinion, that Fairs began and came up by the flocking of Christians to the place for the solemnizing of some festivall, such either as the feast of the Churches dedication or other the like; and saith it is easie to conjecture to what Saint the place hath been com|mended, by the Fair-day: So I am perswaded that this Fair which we hold at <HI>Canterb.</HI> annually on the 7^t^h of <HI>Iuly</HI> (as that other on the 29^t^h of <HI>December)</HI> first came up as a means to gather the greater multitude thither for the celebration of the Anniversary solemnities of <HI>Beckets</HI> translation, on the one, and his passion (as they used to terme it) on the other of those dayes. And (for so my author addes) as Fairs were greater, as the Church and town were of more estima|tion: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Faires.</NOTE> So however these our Fairs at <HI>Canterb.</HI> are now so small as not at all considerable, yet assuredly time was when they were of greater request, and might justly boast of great resort as any elsewhere: the decay of them and of the trading of our city participating of both one cause, namely the defacing of the shrine we now treat of, and the demoli|shing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the decay of <HI>Can|terbury.</HI></NOTE> of such religious houses as were sometime standing in and about the City, the magazins of reputed holy reliques, the incentives unto all sorts of people in those times for their frequent visitation of them. Whence that of M^r <HI>Lam|bert</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Perambula|tion of Kent in <HI>Caterburie.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>To tell the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ruth</HI> (saith he) <HI>little had all these casualties of fire and flame been to the decay of this Town</HI> (speaking be|fore
<PB N="247" REF="147">
of the often firing of <HI>Canterb.) had not the dissolution and finall overthrow of the religious houses also come upon it. For where wealth is at command, how easily are buildings repair|ed? and where opinion of great holinesse is, how soon are cities and towns advanced to great estimation and riches? And there|fore no marvell if after wealth withdrawn, and opinion of holi|nesse removed, the places tumbled headlong to ruine and decay.</HI> Thus he.</P>
<P>The so seasonable application of these observations will <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> shrine.</NOTE> beplea good enough (I trust) for this digression.

in regard both of the treasure that was about it and also of the continuall offerings thereunto by such as either of visi|tation or in pilgrimage made their approaches to it: Which offerings amounted to a great value by the yeer, as I guesse by the accompts thereof for certain yeares which I have seen, shewing that from about 200 <HI>lib. per annu~m</HI> which they arose unto about 300 yeares since; within a six or eight yeares following they were grown to be more then trebled. But (by the way) when the Accomptant comes to Christs altar (the high altar) that's dispatched with a blank or a <HI>Nil: summo altari Nil.</HI> So much had that Shrine obscured this altar. The lesse marvell that the Church dedicated to Christ, gave place (as it did) to the name of S^t <HI>Thomas,</HI> and that the prints of their devotion in the marble stones who crept and kneeled to his Shrine remain to this day; there|in but royallists (as I may call them) or imitators of sove|reigne example, if we but consider with what reverence some of our Kings mention both him and his shrine. <HI>Cujus pretiosum corpus (Hen.</HI> 6. words of him to the Monks of the place) <HI>in ecclesia vestra praedicta glorios&egrave; tumulatum extitit.

<P>To conclude, the Monks (it seems) glorying and pri|ding themselves in nothing more then this of <HI>Beckets</HI> Mar|tyrdome (for so they calld'd his murther) or at leastwise conceiving their Church in no one respect so famous and renowned as in that, and not satisfied with the resemblance or representation of it in that their forenamed common seale; nor knowing better how, either to perpetuate the memory of it, or to make it more generally known abroad then thus: at or about what time that their common seal was renewed, contriving another speciall seal, <HI>ad causas,</HI> (that is, as I conceive, chiefly for matters concerning Ju|risdiction, which, <HI>sede vacante,</HI> devolved into their hands) <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Seale <HI>ad causas.</HI></NOTE> did insculp it also in the same. And now to distinguish this from that their more usuall and common seale, they vary the inscription on both sides of it; that on the forepart, about the ring (containing within it the figure of the Church and <HI>Beckets</HI> Martyrdome) being this ^&dagger;<HI>Sigillum ec|clesiae Christi Cantuarie ad causas:</HI> whilest that on the reverse, about the ring (within which are three smaller rings or cir|cles having in each of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n head or face like to the pi|cture of our Saviours) was this. <HI>Deus pater.

A fair time, in which I finde Record of ma|ny worthy acts done both in and about the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Mo|nastery,</HI> and also in their Demesnes abroad, which therefore I may justly intitle to this Prior: whereof I may not forget the repair of the Quire and Chapter-house which cost 839 <HI>lib.</HI> 7^s8^d. and the <HI>Novum clocarium longum versus North</HI> in the yeare 1317. a Steeple sometime standing on the <HI>North|side</HI> of the Church sithence either with age decayed, or by some alterations or new buildings defaced.

<P>To return to our <HI>Prior.</HI> I finde <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">b. eccles. <HI>Cantuar.</HI></NOTE> that in his time the Church was plentifully furnished with Vines, as at <HI>Colton, Berton, S.

<P>Whereof <HI>William</HI> was the first.

<PB N="303" REF="177">
the Archdeacon of <HI>Sar.</HI> was sent by Archbishop <HI>An|selme</HI> to <HI>Wilton</HI> to inquire out the truth of the matter there, it being the place of her education. He is again afterward, to wit <HI>anno</HI> 1108. mentioned by the same Author <HI>pag.</HI> 96. as used and sent by <HI>Anselme,</HI> on his behalfe, to invest and put into possession of the Bishoprick of <HI>Rochester, Ralfe Gun|dulph's</HI> next successour upon whom <HI>Anselme</HI> had bestowed the same. And that is all I reade of him, saving a letter of the same <HI>Anselme</HI> directed to him and others about <HI>Priests</HI> marriages, mentioned in the Acts and Monuments.</P>
<P>His next Successor (and he with whom <HI>Harpsfield</HI> begins his Catalogue) was one <HI>Iohn</HI> nephew unto <HI>Ralfe</HI> the Arch|bishop, who gave him this Archdeaconry with great and un|wonted solemnity, as <HI>Edmerus</HI> relates it <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Hist. memorat. li. 5. pag. 114.</NOTE>, who saith that <HI>Radulphus Archiepisc. consilio &amp; petitione Episcoporum, proxi|m&egrave; supra nominatorum</HI> (to wit <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>London, Roger</HI> of <HI>Salisbury, Herbert</HI> of <HI>Norwich, Ralph</HI> of <HI>Chichester, Iohn</HI> of <HI>Bath,</HI> and <HI>Hervey</HI> of <HI>Ely) dedit (concedentibus &amp; approbantibus Monachis Cantuariensibus) Archidiaconatum ipsius ecclesiae Iohanni nepoti suo. Quae donatio facta est in Capitulo, praesente fratrum conventu, copiosa Clericorum ac Laicorum multitudine, pro hoc ipso in medium adducta, facta prius, coram omnibus, ab eodem Iohanne, tactis Evangeliis, sacramento, quo se fidelita|tem ecclesiae ipsi, per omnia &amp; in omnibus exhibiturum, dum vi|veret, repromisit.</HI> In the yeare 1119. this man was sent by the Archbishop to the Councell then holden at <HI>Remes,</HI> there to withstand the consecration of <HI>Thurstan</HI> the elect of <HI>Yorke</HI> at the hands of the <HI>Pope,</HI> who had beene rejected of <HI>Ralph</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Cant.</HI> for refusing to make profession of sub|jection to his See.

<P><HI>Ascelinus</HI> or <HI>Asketinus</HI> succeeded <HI>Iohn,</HI> both first in the Archdeaconry of <HI>Canterb:</HI> and afterward (as I take it) in
<PB N="304" REF="178">
the Bishoprick of <HI>Rochester.</HI> For upon the death of <HI>Iohn, Asce|linus</HI> (saith the Catal. of B B.) succeeded, and died <HI>anno</HI> 1147. Likely to be this Archdeacon.</P>
<P><HI>Helewisus</HI> or <HI>Helvinus</HI> succeeded. He was sent by Arch|bishop <HI>Corboyl</HI> together with the B B. of S^t. <HI>Davids</HI> and <HI>Ro|chester,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line">.</NOTE> to put the Monks of <HI>Dover</HI> in possession of their new Monastery built for them by that Archbishop, in the yeare 1134. which is all I reade of him.</P>
<P><HI>Walter</HI> succeeded him. He was afterward, to wit in the yeare 1147. elected Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and was the first that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> ever was made Bishop there by the <HI>Monks</HI> election. The Archbishop of <HI>Cant.</HI> was wont aforetime to nominate to this Bishoprick whom pleased him. <HI>Theobald</HI> the Archbishop bestowed this priviledge upon them, by whose command they chose this <HI>Walter,</HI> who was the Archbishops brother for their Bishop. Which Bishoprick he held 35. years, and dyed in the yeare 1182.</P>
<P>He was succeeded in the Archdeaconry by <HI>Roger,</HI> pre|ferred thereunto by <HI>Theobald</HI> the Archbishop (as were his immediate Predecessor and Successors:) By whose means he became afterwards Archbishop of <HI>York.</HI> Reade more of him (if you please) in the <HI>Catal.</HI> of BB. in <HI>York:</HI> where one thing is chiefly remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> that whereas in his life <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> time he had procured of Pope <HI>Alex.</HI> this priviledge, that if any Clergy man died in his Province, and delivered not his goods away by hand before his death, the Archbish. should have the disposition of them; it pleased God that the same measure he met unto other, he should be served withall himself. He left behinde him (or had at least wise what time he sickned) 11000 <HI>lib.</HI> in silver, and 300 <HI>lib.</HI> of gold, beside an infinite deale of plate, and sumptuous houshold|stuffe. All this (though he had bestowed it to the use of the poore and other good purposes) the King notwithstanding seized upon, and converted it to his own use, saying it was no reason that his Will should stand for good, that had dis|annulled the testaments of so many other.</P>
<P>Being Archdeacon (as he was one that savoured not the
<PB N="305" REF="178">
Monks of his time <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Godwin.</NOTE>) he proved very troublesome and offen|sive to them of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> by intruding himself amongst them, and into their Chapters and assemblies, as one of the society. Being no Monk, but a secular, the Monks could not brook his doings: but addressing themselves to the Archbishop for remedy, they procured of him the follow|ing letters.

<P>Of this Archdeacon you may see more in <HI>Richard</HI> Arch|bishop of <HI>Canterb.</HI> in the <HI>Catalogue</HI> afore cited.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Becket</HI> succeeded <HI>Roger.</HI> But he that so favoured him as to bring him to this dignity, Archbishop <HI>Theobald,</HI> prevailed so farre with the King for his further advance|ment, as that, after the accession of other preferments, at length <HI>Theobald</HI> dying, this man was selected by the King for his Successor. His story is obvious, wherefore I will not repeat it, and the rather because I have my self delivered many things of him before in proper place.</P>
<P><HI>Geffrey Ridell</HI> succeeded <HI>Becket:</HI> and was as the 3 former, of <HI>Theobalds</HI> preferring and putting in. He continued Archdeacon untill Archbishop <HI>Beckets</HI> time, whose story
<PB N="306" REF="179">
mentions him as an enemy to him and his proceedings, as taking part with the King in his quarell with <HI>Becket,</HI> who therefore excommunicated him as you may reade in <HI>Rog.

<P>For the first, <HI>Robert:</HI> I reade that of Archdeacon of <HI>Can|terb.</HI> he was made Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> succeeding <HI>Hubert</HI> that was translated thence to <HI>Canterb:</HI> in the yeare 1193.</P>
<P>The second <HI>Hen. de Castilion</HI> succeeded <HI>Robert,</HI> and was Archdeacon in <HI>Hubert</HI> the Archbishops time: as I finde by divers of his subscriptions to charters and other evidences
<PB N="308" REF="180">
of S^t. <HI>Radigund's</HI> Abbey by <HI>Dover,</HI> made by <HI>Hubert</HI> and o|thers. In the yeare of our Lord 1202. this man being Arch|deacon, there happened a great controversie between King <HI>Iohn</HI> and the Monks of S^t. <HI>Augustines</HI> touching the right of the patronage of the Church of <HI>Feversham.</HI> They were so <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feversham.</NOTE> stiffe and stout on both sides in the carriage of the businesse, that through the violence that was used by the one to out the other of possession, the Churches prophanation ensued, whereupon this our Archdeacon challenging right to the custodie of the Church during the vacancy thereof, inter|poseth himselfe, excommunicates the <HI>Monks</HI> for holding the Church by force, overthrows the altars as thereby pro|faned, and then interdicts the Church. The <HI>Monks</HI> streight|way appeale to the <HI>Pope.</HI> He sends out his commission for the full understanding of the matter: But (saith <HI>Lambert</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Perambul. of <HI>Kent,</HI> in <HI>Fever|sham.</HI></NOTE>) the Monks (being now better advised) took a shorter way, and sending presents to the King, they both obtained at his hands restitution of their right, and also wan him to become their good Lord and Patron. Notwithstanding, the Arch|deacon and they proceeded on in suite at <HI>Rome,</HI> about the custodie and fruitss of their vacant Churches: this and <HI>Mil|ton</HI> especially. In which suite issued out that <HI>Decretal</HI> Epistle of <HI>Innocent 3. Bonae memoriae. de Appellatio.</HI> directed to the B B. of <HI>Rochester</HI> and <HI>London.</HI> I finde also amongst the re|cords of Christ-church a long scrowle of witnesses depositi|ons taken as well on the one part as the other, but what was the issue or finall end of the controversie I know not, but do guesse (by a like course afterward taken with a succeeding Archdeacon upon this quarell renewed) he had compositi|on given him by the <HI>Monks,</HI> and thereby some share and part with them of the profits of their vacant Churches yeelded to him for a peace. The matter which they strove for, was in those dayes of moment and very considerable, but the case is now altered by Stat. which gives the Suc|cessour <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">8. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. 8. 11.</NOTE> the fruits in the vacancie, and so hath cut off such brabbles.

Charter made to the <HI>Monks</HI> of Christ-Church, acquitting them of the Cities walling and inditching in <HI>Ric.</HI> 1. time.</P>
<P>I come now to the third Archdeacon of this Century, which was <HI>Hen. de Stanford</HI> or <HI>Sandford</HI> (for I finde him writ|ten either way, and <HI>Harpsfield</HI> writes him <HI>Stafford)</HI> elected afterwards to the Bishoprick of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and consecrate <HI>anno</HI> 1227. Being Archdeacon, he tooke a resignation of <HI>Blean</HI> Church, by the title of <HI>vices gerens Domini Stephani Cantuariensis,</HI> which was Archbishop <HI>Langton.</HI> He was co|executor with the Prior of <HI>Christ-</HI>Church, of the Lady <HI>Ag|nes</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"> Lib.

<P>This Archdeacon being so preferred: <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> who was then Archbishop, having to his brother one <HI>Simon Langton</HI> (one that was not onely out of meanes, but also out of favour both with the King and Pope, the latter, by means of the former giving him the repulse for the Archbishoprick <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt.

In favour of whom <HI>(carne &amp; sanguine revelante,</HI> saith a Record in Christ-Church) he much amended the Arch|deaconry. For with the consent and confirmation of the Chapter, he annexed and united to it, not only the Churches (or Personages) of <HI>Tenham</HI> and <HI>Hackington,</HI> but also the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenham. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> whole Jurisdiction over the Diocesse, with an exception onely and reservation of some causes and Churches. <HI>Et quia</HI> (saith the Record in Christ-Church) <HI>dictus Archidiaconatus exilis erat in possess, concessit eidem Simoni totam Iurisdictio|nem Diocesanam in Decanatibus ruralibus, exceptis causis ma|trimonialibus &amp; ecclesiis quae sunt in maneriis Archiepiscopatus &amp; Monachorum, de quibus se nihil intromittebat.</HI> But you may see (if you please) in my <HI>Appendix,</HI> the double Instrument of the conveyance of both one and the other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide pro Scri|ptur. 20. &amp; 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. in Appendice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To compleate and make this grant absolute: whereas <HI>Baldwyn</HI> and <HI>Hubert</HI> his predecessors, upon the controversie between them and the Monkes about the Chapels of <HI>Ha|kington</HI> and <HI>Lambhith,</HI> upon displeasure taken against the
<PB N="310" REF="181">
Archdeacon (it is like) for opposing them and their project in behalfe of the Monks, had exempted certaine Churches: this <HI>Stephen,</HI> with the Monkes consent, by a speciall Char|ter, reverseth and revokes that exemption, and subjects againe the Churches to the Archdeacons Jurisdiction in such manner as by the tenor of the Charter copied in my <HI>Appendix Scriptura</HI> 22. may and will appeare. And then be|gan <NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">chidiaconal Iurisdiction <HI>enlarged.</HI></NOTE> the Archdeaconry to be enlarged, this Archdeacon being the first that ever had a reall or perpetuall grant made to him and his Successors of the <HI>Archidiaconal Iurisdiction,</HI> whose predecessors never had other then a personall, such as was that (before set forth) made to <HI>Herbert,</HI> or the like.</P>
<P>These things happening in <HI>December Anno Domini</HI> 1227. In the moneth of <HI>February</HI> next following, the same Arch|deacon makes a double Charter to the Monkes, whether in consideration of their passing their consent to the uniting the two foresaid Churches of <HI>Hakynton</HI> and <HI>Tenham</HI> to the Archdeaconry, or wherefore else to me appeares not; by the one, conveying to them, with consent of his brother the Archbishop, <HI>omnes decimas de Eylwarton majores &amp; mi|nores</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ery <HI>of</HI> Yel|verton.</NOTE> <HI>sitas infra limites parochiae de stanes Capella de Tenham:</HI> which at this day passe by and under the name of dominicall or demeasne-tithes. i.

<PB N="311" REF="181">
kept it, as to the propriety of it at least wise, untill the 25. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. and was the same (I take it) which they then exchan|ged with the Canons of the place for other the like of theirs: in the deed whereof I finde it thus described, <HI>viz. Placiam suam cum pertinen. jacen. inter Curiam. S. Gregorii versus South, venellam de Baggeb' vers. North, ortum de Forgehagh vers. East, &amp; ortum quondam Iohannis le Gerdeler versus West.</HI> The Archdeacon then removing thence, he setled and seated himselfe (as I said) at <HI>Hakynton,</HI> where his usuall residence continued untill that of late dayes the man|sion house was alienated. Of late dayes, I say, for I reade that not onely Archbishop <HI>Arundell</HI> in <HI>Hen.</HI> 5. time dyed at the Archdeacon of <HI>Canterbury</HI> his mansion house at <HI>Hakyn|ton,</HI> but that of late in <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. dayes Archbishop <HI>Warham</HI> did likewise. But now it is gone, and the Archdeacon, <HI>quatenus Archdeacon,</HI> left houselesse.</P>
<P>I returne to our present Archdeacon <HI>Simon,</HI> who in the vacancy of the See by Archbishop <HI>Edmunds</HI> death which stood <HI>Peter Lambard</HI> the Monkes Officiall, for that time of the vacancy, challenging to himselfe in right of his Arch|deaconry all the Iurisdiction both <HI>Provinciall</HI> and <HI>Diocesan.</HI> But at length after some alterations <HI>hinc inde,</HI> all conten|tions betweene the Chapter and him in that behalfe were friendly ended by a personall composition, a Copy whereof (that you may see the then state of this Archdeaconry) I suppose in my <HI>Appendix</HI> to set forth. This man, before he was Archdeacon tooke part (against King <HI>Iohn)</HI> with <HI>Lewis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vale pro Scrip|tura 23. in Ap|pend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ce.

<P><HI>Stephanus de Vicenna</HI> succeeded <HI>Simon Langton.</HI> So the processe of the suit between his Successor <HI>Richard de Fer|rings</HI> and the <HI>Chapter</HI> about title of Jurisdiction in the va|cancy of the See informs me, which gives a Catalogue of the Archdeacons, and the order of their succession from <HI>Simon Langton</HI> down to that <HI>Richard.</HI> He held the place till his death, which by the computation of that processe was about x. yeares.</P>
<P>But I am perswaded that one <HI>Stephanus de monte Luelli</HI> ought to have a share with him of that time allotted to him for his incumbency in that dignity, which that process omit|ting this <HI>Stephen</HI> reckons between the former <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Hugh Mortimer.</HI> For in the yeer 1257. in the time of Archbi|shop <HI>Boniface,</HI> I finde in a Lieger of S. <HI>Radigund's</HI> Abbey by Dover the subscription of this <HI>Stephanus de monte Luelli,</HI> by the expresse title of Archdeacon of <HI>Canterb.</HI> as (with others) a witnesse to some Instruments or Charters made to that Abbey by the Archbishop.

He was with|all a Prebendary of <HI>Canterbury</HI> whom Doctor <HI>Moulin,</HI> after many other, doth succeed.

<P><HI>Harpsfield</HI> in the beginning of Queene <HI>Elizabeths</HI> reigne, being deprived, <HI>Edmund Guest</HI> succeeded in the Archdea|conry, and shortly after, to wit <HI>Anno</HI> 1559. was consecrate Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and translated thence to <HI>Salisbury Anno</HI> 1571. Where you may see more of him in the Catalogue of B B.</P>
<P>His next Successor was <HI>Edmund Freake,</HI> both in the Arch|deaconry, and also in the Bishopricke of <HI>Rochester,</HI> with which latter he held the Archdeaconry in <HI>Commendam,</HI> un|till he was afterward removed to <HI>Norwich,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Worceter.</HI> The fore-cited Catalogue will tell you more of him.</P>

<HEAD>Parochial Churches.</HEAD>
<P>I Come in the next place, according to my method, to speake of the <HI>parochiall</HI> Churches in and about the City. Give me leave, before I treate of them in severall (as I mean to doe) to premise a few things touching them in generall. It is but of a very few of them, that I know or have found the certaine either time or Author of their foundation. But as I shall shew you that some of them have beene erected since the <HI>Conquest:</HI> so I conceive (and am verily perswaded) none of them (except Saint <HI>Martins)</HI> doe much, if at all, exceed the same in age, and that for many inducements. One that before it our Churches were generally built and made of Wood, and it is a thing noted of the <HI>Normans,</HI> that upon their <HI>Income</HI> they builded their Churches of stone <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Stow. Daniell.</NOTE>. Another is that the Saints whose names some of our Churches doe carry will not beare any much greater age, as Saint <HI>Alphege,</HI> S^t <HI>Dunstan,</HI> S^t <HI>Edmund</HI> the King and Martyr. A third reason I have, and I take it from a Deed or Char|ter of <HI>Coenulf</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and <HI>Cuthred</HI> his brother, King of <HI>Kent,</HI> made to the Abbesse and her Nonnes of <HI>Li|minge,</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"> In Archivis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. Cant.</NOTE> and dated <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 804. granting them a cer|taine parcell of Land in our City, appertaining (saith the Charter or <HI>Land-boc)</HI> to a Church situate in the West part of the same, built in honour of Saint <HI>Mary.</HI> Now no such Church is, or since the Conquest (that I ever found) was standing in that part of our City. Whence I inferre, that the face and condition of our City hath suffered an utter change since those dayes; and because we read that the <HI>Danes</HI> made havocke both of people and place in King <HI>Etheldreds</HI> dayes, slaying the most part of the one, and burning and spoiling all the other (not sparing the <HI>Cathedrall</HI> it selfe) I thinke we may justly charge upon that all-wasting deluge the utter subversion of such Churches as then were in our City, and consequently may not imagin any of our modern Churches (except as is before excepted) so ancient as to preced, but
<PB N="325" REF="188">
contrariwise to succeed and follow the same. The Deed or Charter, because it may give content to some sort of Rea|ders, and indeed historically glanceth at the misery that our Countrey suffered by the frequent invasion of the <HI>Danes,</HI> as I conceive of it from the end for which this land was given by it to the <HI>Nonnes,</HI> being <HI>(Ad necessitatis refu|gium)</HI> I here subjoyne.

Time was it was as absolute a Parish Church as any about the City, and in time of Popery, no doubt for it Tutelar Saints sake fared well and flourished, the change of the times in that point being very probably a maine cause of the Churches decay and desolation.

<P>Now onely a word or two to shew how it came to passe that the Records of the <HI>Consistory</HI> fall so much short of the originall of the Court, as indeed they do, beginning not untill about the yeare 1396. above 100 yeares after the ere|ction of the <HI>Commissariship,</HI> and then leaving the <HI>Commissa|ry,</HI> I shall proceed to speak somewhat of the <HI>Deane.</HI></P>
<P>The cause I cannot impute to the injurie of time consu|ming the Records, because Records of greater antiquity are daily seen, and frequently and generally extant. As I cannot impute it to that, so neither will I ascribe it to the sloth or negligence of the Registers in times past, which I cannot, in charitie, presume upon no better warrant then conjecture; although the meannesse of their places and the moveablenesse of the Court in those and latter times would readily help to support that surmise. To these causes (I say) I will not attribute the cause of our Courts disabili|tie to produce the Records of those elder times. Because (after a hint received from some well versed in <HI>Antiquity)</HI> spending some time about perusing our Chronicles which make mention of the rebellious insurrection made by <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> and <HI>Iack Straw,</HI> happening in the reigne of <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. and in the yeare of our Lord 1381. by and upon this perusall of the story, I found that they and their complices bare an especiall hatred and spite to Lawyers, insomuch that not onely they wasted and consumed with fire the Lawyers houses then situate neare <HI>Temple-</HI>barre <HI>London;</HI> but also being at, <HI>Canterb.</HI> and having received kinde welcome and intertainment of the Townsmen there (all the people be|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> of their assent) upon their departure, taking their way to <HI>Rochester,</HI> they sent their people to the villages about, and in their going they beat down and robbed the houses of <HI>Advocates</HI> and <HI>Procurers</HI> of the Kings Court and of the Archbishop, bearing him much malice for imprisoning their Priest, <HI>Iohn Ball,</HI> a seditious malecontent and hypocri|ticall
<PB N="356" REF="204">
Preacher. What should kindle in them this fire of en|vy to Lawyers, is easily apprehended if the drift of this their seditious rising be but considered. For like the <HI>Stoicks</HI> of old, whose hearts were set upon a <HI>communitie;</HI> whence that of <HI>Seneca. Homines quietissim&egrave; viverent si haec duo Pronomina de medio tollerentur, meum &amp; tuum)</HI> a <HI>parity</HI> and <HI>communitie</HI> was the thing projected, and the effecting of a <HI>plebetan li|bertie</HI> their aime, whereunto they well knew (as who knows it not) that laws and Lawyers were notorious enemies and obstacles: in as much as <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> cannot stand with <HI>community,</HI> for
<Q><L>Si teneant omnes omnia, nemo suum.</L></Q></P>
<P>Therefore saith one, speaking of this <HI>Ball,</HI> he perswaded or counselled them to kill and murder (amongst others) all <HI>Lawyers, Iusticers,</HI> and all manner <HI>Iudges, Magistrates</HI> and men in <HI>authoritie &amp;c.</HI> Herewithall, what writings or Re|cords soever they could fasten on where they came (as an|other obstacle to their projects thriving, which they were to remove) they concluded to set on fire. Hence was it that at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the rabble of them there, breaking up the chests and forcing the places where the Records of the Vni|versitie were kept, without regard had, or difference made of any writings, whether <HI>Charters, Bulls, Letters patents, Statutes</HI> or other monuments whatsoever, in the Market place, some, other elsewhere they committed to the flame. Now to bring this home to my present purpose, which is to shew what is become of our Records of the <HI>Consistory</HI> of <HI>Canterb.</HI> before those now extant. Having by this Story found how Lawyers and law-records were maliced by these all-wasting rebells, and considering (by comparing of the times) that our <HI>Registry</HI> takes its beginning not till awhile some few yeares after this rebellion, (it not being able pre|sently to gather breath again) and that it was and is the Archbishops Registry whom they maliced even to the death: I cannot but perswade my self, and in mine opinion more then conjecturall it is, that those elder Records and their <HI>Registry</HI> bare a share with the rest of the Records and
<PB N="357" REF="204">
Lawyers houses w^c^h suffered the violence of those Rebells.</P>
<P>I passe now from our <HI>Co~missary</HI> w^t^h an hearty wish that the following Distichon (w^c^h <HI>George Sandys</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Relation. lib. 1. pag. 6.</NOTE> tells me is set over the court of Justice at <HI>Zant</HI> may be ever verifi'd of his <HI>Consi|story.</HI>

<P>Having done with the <HI>Commissary,</HI> it remains that I speak <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deane of <HI>Can|ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ury.</HI></NOTE> somewhat of the <HI>Dean,</HI> an ecclesiasticall officer set to over|see a certain number of Parishes, amongst w^c^h are those of our City, &amp; a necessary member in the ecclesiasticall or spi|rituall government of the same. We call him a <HI>Rurall Deane.</HI></P>
<P>Now rurall Deanes (to speak of them first in the gene|rall) are the same with <HI>Archipresbyteri vicani</HI> or <HI>rurales,</HI> and their names are often confounded, but more frequently occurreth the name of <HI>Archipresbyter,</HI> and is more used amongst the <HI>Canonists,</HI> then that of <HI>Decanus.</HI> Wherefore I am minded to expound this of <HI>Deane</HI> by that of <HI>Arch-priest</HI> (an Ecclesiasticall degree, by the order of the <HI>Decretalls</HI> following next unto an Archdeacon, and following rather then preceding, because that albeit the <HI>Arch-priest</HI> be, then the <HI>Arch-deacon</HI> (if he be but a <HI>Deacon</HI> and not a <HI>Priest) ma|jor ordine,</HI> yet is the <HI>Arch-deacon</HI> then the <HI>Arch-priest major dignitate</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Gl. in c. 1. de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ic.

<P>By this intended <HI>Constitution</HI> you see much of the pristine authority of <HI>Rurall Deanes,</HI> was meant to be annexed to them and their office.

So that of the quality, use and office of our <HI>Rurall Deanes,</HI> all the face that surviveth, or can be ga|thered from any expresse law or Constitution made touch|ing them since the reformation, is represented and exhibi|ted unto us by part of an English <HI>Canon</HI> made and published <HI>in Anno Dom.</HI> 1571. runneth thus. <HI>When the visitation is fini|shed, the Archdeacon shall signifie unto the Bishop, whom he hath found in every Deanry so furnished with learning and judgement,
<PB N="362" REF="207">
that they may be thought worthy to instruct the people in Sermons, and to rule and govern others. Of these the Bishop may choose some, whom he will have rurall Deanes</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">This under the title of Archdeacons.</NOTE>. Hitherto and enough of <HI>Rurall Deanes</HI> in generall: onely let me tell you, that I suppose they were more in request when Ecclesiasticall Courts were moveable, and kept from <HI>Deanry</HI> to <HI>Deanry</HI> (for which see the Constitution <HI>Excussis.

<P>Now a word or two of our particular <HI>Deane,</HI> to whom I finde that former times have had recourse for his assistance in many things.

<P>How our City was governed <HI>in temporalibus,</HI> before the time of the <HI>Bailiffes</HI> is somewhat obscure.

<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Rather then my Reader should swallow an error in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbal|downe.</NOTE> <HI>Etymologie</HI> of this name (of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Looke for a discourse of the originall of this name at the end of this Instrument. The names o|riginall exa|mined.</NOTE> <HI>Herbaldowne)</HI> I have thought fit here (though out of proper place) to recommend unto him some notions concerning the same (which very lately came into my thoughts) to supply their omission in my dis|course of the place. So it is then, that M^r <HI>Lambard</HI> in his <HI>Perambulation</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> writing of this place, intitles his discourse thereof thus. <HI>Herbaldowne by Canterbury, in Saxon</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>that is, the Hill where the Army was betrayed.</HI> Hence a man would thinke, (as no question but the infe|rence is made by some) that M^r <HI>Lambard</HI> met with that <HI>Saxon</HI> name of the place in some ancient Record or Monu|ment of the <HI>Saxons</HI> times. And indeed if he did not, he was to blame thus in a manner, to affirme as much. Per|emptorily to deny that he did, I will not presume; but shall here propose to the consideration of my Reader such probable presumptions to the contrary; and that the place tooke and gain'd the present name of <HI>Herbaldowne,</HI> from other grounds long since the <HI>Saxons</HI> times, as, I thinke, may give just cause of suspition that M^r <HI>Lambard</HI> never had war|rant for that name from any kinde of <HI>Saxon</HI> antiquity what|soever. I have collected them chiefly from the ancient <HI>Re|cords</HI> and <HI>Evidences</HI> of the <HI>Hospitall</HI> there, whereof Arch|bishop <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> in the <HI>Conquerors</HI> time, was the undoubted Founder, which I thinke the best and fittest Judges to try and determine this matter.</P>
<P>But for entry into this discourse, let me intreate you in the first place, to observe with me, that as this name of <GAP DESC="foreign"> hath no ground in Story (no Chronicle of ours that ever I saw recording any such occurrence as the betraying of an Army, either there, or any where else thereabouts:) so M^r <HI>Lambard</HI> is silent in the instancing or specifying of any such matter for the illustration of the
<PB N="382" REF="217">
name. Next if we consult <HI>Edmerus,</HI> who lived a Monk of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. time, and Records the erection of the <HI>Hospitall</HI> there by <HI>Lanfranc,</HI> and the situation of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vide pag. 82.</NOTE>, we shall find him make no mention of the name of <HI>Herbaldowne,</HI> or of any other proper name it then had; not likely to have escap'd his pen, but that also it escap'd his knowledge. Now examine we the <HI>Hospitall Records.</HI> The eldest whereof that I have seene (and I thinke I have not left any unsearched) have no mention at all neither, of that name, untill <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. time. A Charter there of <HI>H.</HI> 1. concerning <HI>Assarts</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For <HI>Assarts,</HI> what they sig|nifie, see S^r <HI>Hen. Spelmans</HI> Glossary in <HI>Verb. Assa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tum.</HI></NOTE> (grub|bing up of wood, I take it) which you shall have anone, calls it <HI>Hospitale de bosco de Blen.</HI> Another Charter there of a sixe penny quit-rent out of a house in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> seeming, both by the style and Charter to be made not long after the former, gives it no other denomination then of, <HI>Hospitale de Sancto Nicolao</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A name which neither <HI>Edmerus</HI> nor the former Charter men|tions: and therefore I question whe|ther the Church so cal|led were then in being or not.</NOTE>. True it is that a following Charterthere, <HI>viz.</HI> of xx markes <HI>per annum,</HI> given to the <HI>Hospitall</HI> (not by <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. as before it is mistaken <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pag. 84.</NOTE>, but) by <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. payable out of the Fee-ferme of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and continued to this day, makes expresse mention of the name of <HI>Herbaldowne,</HI> in these words: <HI>Leprosis de Herbaldona</HI> xx <HI>marcatas redditus singulis annis habendas de redditu meo Cantuaria, donec eas assignem alibi suscipiendas vel in ecclesiis vel in aliis redditibus &amp;c.</HI> And another Charter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>In lib. Hosp. de</HI> Esthridge, Cantuar.</NOTE> much of that age, made by Archbishop <HI>Theobald,</HI> granting to the Church of S^t <HI>Nicho|las</HI> there, and to the Priest officiating in the same, the Tithes of <HI>Westgate-Court</HI> (or <HI>Manor)</HI> makes like mention of the name. Cleerely then so old it is: and that it should be much elder, I would be glad that any could shew me as sa|tisfactory reasons, as, I thinke I can them, that it is not. Not to repeate these already premised; I must acquaint you that the <HI>quondam</HI> extent and continent of <HI>Blen-</HI>wood (or of the <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Blen,</HI> as I have seene it called in some old Deeds) <HI>cujus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> pars ben&egrave; magna in agros ac pascua compla|natur,</HI> as <HI>Twine</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Derebus Al|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">onic. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. pag. 101.</NOTE> hath it: was much larger then of late and at this day. By that Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. concerning <HI>Assarts,</HI> it may plainely, and without any straining or inferrement,
<PB N="383" REF="217">
be inferred that it then extended to the place of the <HI>Hospi|talls</HI> situation: and therefore doth the Deed call it (as the best description, and most intelligible and proper for it at that time) <HI>Hospitale de bosco de Blen,</HI> (that is, the <HI>Hospitall of</HI> (or <HI>within) Blen-wood)</HI> without any other proper name. But (to come now to the originall and ground of the name of <HI>Harbaldowne)</HI> not long afterwards, to wit, in the interim of time betweene this Charter, and those afore-mentioned of <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. time, I conceive the place, by grubbing or roo|ting up the wood there, was disforested, manured; and from Wood-land converted to herbage, or tillage. Aswell the <HI>Hospitals</HI> denomination in that Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. calling it (as I said) <HI>Hospitale de bosco de Blen;</HI> as the <HI>Grant</HI> it selfe, being to give the <HI>Hospitallers</HI> liberty to ridd away 8. perches of wood, on all sides (or round about) the <HI>Hospitall,</HI> plainly inferres that the place was woody then.

But specially you are to have care of Archers; and that they, who remaine at home, and have vacation from warre, hold Bowes and Arrowes in their houses. For care|lesnesse herein hath brought great damage to the Romane State. <HI>So</HI> Leo. <HI>This of old time was the opinion of the Romanes concerning Archers. How we are falne out with them in our dayes (the skill of the Bow, being a quality so commendable, and so proper to our Nation) I know not, unlesse fire-weapons perhaps have put them out of countenance. And surely it may not be de|nyed, that the force of fire-weapons of our time doth farre exceed the height of all old inventions for annoying the enemy. And, when I have given them the first place, I will not doubt to give the second to Bowes and Arrowes: being so farre from casting them of, that I would rather follow the wisdome of the Grecians; who albeit they esteemed Arrowes the best flying weapons, yet thought it not amisse to hold in use slinges, and darts. Every weapon hath it property; and that which is fit for one service, is not so fit for another. The fire-weapons have their advantages; They have also their disadvantages. Their advantage is, they pierce all defence of armour, and lighting upon a place of the body, the wound whereof endangereth life, they bring with
<PB N="482" REF="267">
them certaine death. Their disadvantages are, they are not al|wayes certaine, sometimes for want of charging, sometimes through overcharging, sometimes the Bullet rowling out, some|times for want of good powder, or of dryed powder, sometimes because of an ill dryed match, not fit to coale, or not well cocked. Besides they are somewhat long in charging, while the</HI> Muske|tier <HI>takes downe his Musket,</HI> uncockes <HI>the match,</HI> blowes, proynes, shuts, casts <HI>of the pan,</HI> castes about <HI>the musket,</HI> o|pens <HI>his charges,</HI> chargeth, drawes out <HI>his skouring sticke,</HI> rammes in <HI>the powder,</HI> drawes out <HI>againe, and</HI> puts up <HI>his skouring sticke,</HI> layes <HI>the musket on the rest,</HI> blowes <HI>of the match,</HI> cockes, <HI>and</HI> tryes <HI>it,</HI> gardes <HI>the pan, and so</HI> makes ready. <HI>All which actions must necessarily be observed, if you will not faile of the true use of a Musket. In raine, snow, fogs, or when the enemy hath gained the winde, they have small use. Adde that but one ranke (that is the first) can give fire upon the enemy at once. For the rest behinde, discharging, shall either wound their owne Companions before, or else shoote at randon, and so nothing endanger the enemy, the force of a musket being onely availeable at point blancke. Contrariwise the disadvantage of Arrowes is in the weaknesse of the stroke, which is not able to enter a Curace, that the foote or horse now use. Yet can no wea|ther be found, wherein you may not have good use of Bowes: raine, snow, winde, haile, fogs, hinder little (especially the string of the Bow being not to wet) nay rather profit. Because in them you can hardly discerne, muchlesse avoyde, the fall of the Arrow. As for quicknesse in delivery, the Bow farre excelleth the Musket. A good single Archer is able to give five shot in ex|change for one of the Musketier; and that with such certainty, that you shall not heare of an Archer that misseth the delivery of his Arrow, where the Musketier, often faileth by reason of the accidents and impediments before by me rehearsed. Ioyne that a whole squadron of Archers, being embattailed, may shoote at once together: which onely the first ranke of Musketiers may doe. And make the case there were a hundred Musketiers, and a hundred Bow-men each digested into ten files, each file contai|ning ten men, the Bow-men shall be able to shoote at once a hun|dred
<PB N="483" REF="267">
Arrowes (all their Arrowes) for ten Bullets given by the Musketiers, namely those ten of the first ranke discharging alone. It must not be pretermitted, that the Bow and Quiver both for marching, and all service, are lighter and of lesse labour to use, then a Musket, which is no small advantage in armes and fight. To conclude, the Bow-men may be placed behinde the armed foote, and yet in shooting over the Phalange annoy the ene|my before joyning, and</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Plut. <HI>in</HI> Sylla.</NOTE> <HI>all the time of fight, even whilst they are at pushe of Pike; where the Musketier, there placed, must either idlely looke on, or else playing with his Musket, most of all endanger his owne friends. Neither is the force of Arrowes so weake, as is imagined, no not in the arming of our dayes. For the Pike albeit he have his head and body covered, yet are his legs, and feete, his armes, and hands open to wounds: any of which parts being wounded brings a disability of service. To say nothing of his face, and eyes, before which the showers of Ar|rowes falling like a tempest without intermission, must needs breed a remedilesse terror, and make him thinke rather of saving himselfe, then offending his enemy. The Musketier being also unarmed is as subject to the shot of Arrowes, as the Archer is to the shot of the Musket; and the Arrow touching any vitall part, as much taketh away life, as doth the Musket. Lastly a horse-man for his owne person (I must confesse) is safe enough from the danger of Arrowes by reason of his armour; but his horse, being a faire and large marke, and having neither barbe, nor pectorall, nor ought else to hide his head or breast, how can hee escape wounds? Witnesse our fields in</HI> France, <HI>where our Ar|chers alwayes beate the French horse, being barbed, and better armed, then our horse are, at this day. And for the bloudy effect of Bowes the story of</HI> Plutarch <HI>is worth the rehearsing. He, in the life of</HI> Crassus <HI>hath thus:</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Plutarch <HI>in</HI> Crasso.</NOTE> The Parthians opposing the Cataphracts against the Romane horse, the other Persians galloping here and there dispersedly, and troubling the face of the field, broke up from the bottome, Hils of Sand, that raised infinite dust, whereby the Romanes lost their sight and voyce: and thronging together, and thrusting one another were wounded, and dyed not a simple, of
<PB N="484" REF="268">
quicke death, but tormented with convulsions and pangs of griefe, wallowing up, and downe, in the sand to breake the Arrowes in their wounds, or else endevouring to pluck out the hooked heads, which had pierced veines and si|newes, renting a fresh themselves, and adding torment to torment: so that many dyed in this manner, and the rest became unprofitable. And when <HI>Publius Crassus</HI> desired them once more to charge the Cataphracts, they shewed their hands nailed to their Targets, and their feete faste|ned to the ground, whereby they were unable either to flye, or fight. <HI>These wonders did the Parthian Bowes, which notwithstanding were not to be compared to our ancient English Bowes, either for strength, or farre shooting. And that we may not seeme to rely upon antiquity alone.</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Patric.</HI> paral. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">il. pa l. 2. 39.</NOTE> <HI>The battaile of</HI> Curzo|lare <HI>(commonly called the battaile of</HI> Lepanto) <HI>fought in our dayes betwixt the Turkes, and Christians by Sea may serve for an experience of the service of Bowes and Arrowes. In which there dyed of the Christians by the Arrowes of the Turkes above five thousand, albeit they were in Galleyes and Ships, and had their blinds pretended to save from sight, and marke of the Turkes, where as the Artillery of all sorts of the Christians consumed not so many Turkes: notwithstanding the Christians had the victo|ry. Now then for us to leave the Bow, being a weapon of so great efficacy, so ready, so familiar, and as it were so domesticall to our Nation, to which we were wont to be accustomed from our Cradle, because other Nations take themselves to the Musket, hath not so much as any shew of reason. Other Nations may well forbeare that, they never had. Neither Italian, nor Spaniard, nor French, nor Dutch, have these five hundred yeares, beene accounted Ar|chers. It was a skill almost appropriated to our Nation. By it, we gained the battailes of</HI> Cressy, <HI>of</HI> Poitiers, <HI>of</HI> Agincourt, <HI>in</HI> France: <HI>of</HI> Navarre, <HI>in</HI> Spaine: <HI>By it, we made our selves famous over Christendome. And to give it over upon a conceit onely (for no experience can say that our Bow was ever beaten out of the field by the Musket) will prove an imitation of</HI> Aesops <HI>dog, who carrying a piece of flesh in his mouth over a River, and se|ing the shaddow in the water, snatched at the shaddow, and left
<PB N="485" REF="268">
the flesh. I speake not this to abase the service of Muskets, which all men must acknowledge to be great; I onely shew, there may be good use of Bowes, if our Archers were such, as they were wont: which is not to be despaired, and will easily come with exercise.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Discourse of the Priviledge commonly called <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide pro <HI>Becket</HI> in Catalogo Archiep.</NOTE> Clergy, branched into the five following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>

<ITEM>4. The extent of it to lay men, and the cause thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The declining of it by degrees, and restrained condition thereof with us at this day.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>TO begin with the first. The better to know the nature and quality of this priviledge, liberty, immunity, ex|emption <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Particu|lar.</NOTE> (callit which you please) I must let you know, that by the Canon-law (for I will looke no higher) every Cler|gie man hath a certaine Franchese granted him, knowne by the terme of <HI>Privilegium Clericale,</HI> the which as a chaine, consisteth and is made of many links. One, and that the chiefe, whereof is this. <HI>That he may not be called to secular judgement</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">c. Si diligenti. De foro comp. &amp; Lindw. in Pro|vinciali. de off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. Ord c. 2. verb. ecclesiasticali pri|vilegio.</NOTE>. That is, that he may not be convented nor brought into question for any matter by or before a tempo|rall Judge. Within the compasse and extent of the which priviledge, the Canons and Canonists bring as well civill as criminall causes, so exempting Clerkes from the secular power in the one as well as the other. And by the way, if D^r <HI>Ridley,</HI> from whom I have it, be not deceived, this I may safely say, that many titles of the Canon-law, such as those <HI>of buying and selling, of leasing, letting and taking to ferme, of morgaging and pledging, of giving by Deed of gift, of detecting of collusion, and cousenage, of murder, of theft, and
<PB N="486" REF="269">
receiving of theeves, and such like,</HI> although they are known notoriously to belong to the conusance of the Common|law at this day, yet with the matters whereof they treate, were anciently in practice and allowed in Bishops Courts, in this land, amongst Clerks. My Author, in my judge|ment, speakes probably, but his reasons are many and large his discourse, and therefore (for brevity sake) I referre you over to his Booke <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">View of the Civill and Ec|clesiasticall Law. <HI>pag.</HI> 103.</NOTE>. In case this once were so, yet time hath worne it quite out of use, a thing both at home and abroad notorious; for <HI>Conarruvias</HI> a late <HI>Civilian</HI> of <HI>Spaine</HI> can say, that, as in <HI>France,</HI> in reall actions, so also in <HI>England,</HI> in reall, mixt and personall actions, by custome here used, Clerks are convented and compelled to answer before the secular Judge <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Conarr. Pract. quaest. c. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">. Tom. 2. pag. 497. num. 5.</NOTE>. A course (as he noteth) that much with|drawes them from their calling, and such an one as is not knowne to take place in <HI>Spaine. Ad rem redeo.</HI> The Clergy of this Kingdome bearing themselves too much upon this priviledge, heretofore dared, and in other parts to this day are not afraid, to act and commit many foule and hai|nous crimes: the truth of which assertion will easily ap|peare by the Story both of the <HI>Venetian Controversie,</HI> and of Archbishop <HI>Becket,</HI> who may be rightly said, like a stout Champion, to have stood in defence and maintenance of this ecclesiasticall liberty (amongst the rest) <HI>usque ad aras:</HI> This being one of the articles, (as himselfe in his Epistle to Pope <HI>Alex.</HI> 3. reports) for which he and the King were at mutuall defiance <HI>viz.

So as it may be said to have prevai|led at that time, as it were, <HI>in contradictorio judicio.</HI> And not onely so but afterward, by degrees, through the meanes of succeeding Archbishops <HI>(Stephen Langton</HI> especially, and <HI>Boniface,</HI> stout Prelates both) backed by the <HI>Pope</HI> and his <HI>Canons,</HI> it did take place so farre, as that, not onely after the publication of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> it was ever construed and conceived to be a Church-liberty<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Vide Stat. 4. <HI>H.</HI> 4. c. 3.</NOTE>, but also sithence, beside the participation that it had with the rest of the Church liberties in generall in their allowance by the often iterated confirmation of that <HI>Grand-Charter,</HI> it became at length established by many particular Acts of Parliament, as first of all by that of the 3. <HI>Ed. 1. c.</HI> 2. following within little more then twenty yeares after the making of the great Charter. The next whereunto (from which we may argue the allowance of it) is that of the 4. <HI>Ed. 1. c.</HI> 5. Thirdly it obtained expresse confirmation by the Stat. of <HI>Articuli Cleri. 9. Ed. 2. c. 15. &amp;</HI> 16. But my purpose being onely in this place to shew the <HI>Antiquitie</HI> of this priviledge, and not to make any larger Catalogue of the Acts of Parliament that have <HI>de tempore in tempus</HI> confirmed it to the Church, then may serve to prove the same to have once, and that how long since, beene in it numbers absolute here in this land, therefore enough of this.</P>
<P>Come we now to the extent of this Priviledge. Touch|ing which I must needs say that the Canon-law (as all know) <NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular 4.</NOTE> affords it onely to Clerkes in orders. Secondly, that, for ought that I can finde, there is not any Statute of this land that <HI>ex professo</HI> hath granted or extended it to laymen, one|ly the Stat. 4. <HI>Hen. 7. c.</HI> 13. and some other since imply it. How is it then that heretofore and at this day laymen lay hold of, and have the benefit of this priviledge? Surely,
<PB N="491" REF="271">
by Custome, which as <HI>Harpsfield</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Hist. eccles. Angl.</NOTE> writing of <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. wit|nesses, first set footing here in those dayes. <HI>Quin &amp; hoc</HI> (saith he) <HI>his temporibus in Anglia obtinuit, ut si quis legere potuisset, &amp; si nullo sacro ordini foret initiatus, pari potiretur privilegio.</HI> Now how this Custome come up I freely confesse I am to learne, and one would wonder how lay-men should come to share with Clerkes in their so peculiar priviledge. <HI>Polydor Virgil</HI> making mention of it, saith because <HI>Clericis affines</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Histor. Angl. lib. 26.</NOTE>. But in my poore opinion haply thus. Because an evident great favour and benefit redounded to Clergy-men in the enjoying of this priviledge, in that notwithstanding their conviction before the secular Magistrate, they might escape without punishment (at least of death, and losse of member) in case they were able canonically to purge them|selves before their Ordinary. And because also by the Canon-law, it belonged to the Church and ecclesiasticall Judge to handle the plea of Clergie, namely whether the offender be indeed (as in word he affirmes himselfe to be) a Clerke<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">C. Si Iudex. de senten. excem. lib. 6.</NOTE>. Therefore, in favour of lay-men, who could not but take it much to heart to see Clerkes by this their immunity to escape, they themselves the whilest for want of it, suffering; and no lesse in favour of life; the secular Magistrates admitting and conniving at their plea, or their Ordinaries plea for them, of Clergy, permitted them as Clerkes to have the benefit of Clergy, in case (to colour over the matter) they could but read like a Clerke (the Booke being made as it were <HI>Vmpire</HI> betweene the two Judges:) the Ordinaries in the interim, for the inlargement of their Jurisdiction readily condiscending, and after com|mon practice had in processe of time given it the force of a Custome and so of a law, being constrained to make no difference in this point of Clerks and Laics that would pray their Clergy, but to challenge, claime and require them all alike; so farre forth (namely in such cases) as the Statutes of the land have not disallowed nor restrained the same. <HI>Ita mihi videtur, correctione alterius melius me sentien|tis semper salva.</HI> And so inclining towards an end of this
<PB N="492" REF="272">
discourse, I desire you to hearken to the last of my five <HI>Par|ticulars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The declining and waning of this Priviledge by degrees, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Particu|lar.</NOTE> <HI>restrained condition thereof with us at this day.</HI> To demon|strate which I will tye my selfe to speake even wholly out of the Statutes and Canons of this our Realme: ordering them so, as that out of them you may see this point histori|cally lead along from beginning to end. Turning then with me the old saying <HI>Religio peperit divitias, &amp; filia devo|ravit matrem,</HI> into <HI>Immunitas peperit impunitatem, &amp; filia &amp;c</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Vt partus ille viperinus, de quo Plinius. lib. 10. c. 62.</NOTE>. you shall see this plainly verified in the subsequent story. If you have beene versed in <HI>Beckets</HI> story, you can|not but know that this immunity stood then generally ac|cused of begetting impunity, and instances of it are there given in some Clerkes that escaped punishment altogether, or, if any, suffered but slight paines nothing answerable to the quality of their faults by vertue of this exemption, which thing caused the Kings so eager oppugning thereof. Now no course or provision (that I can finde) was taken for remedying this abuse either by the Church or State after|wards, untill that <HI>Boniface</HI> aforesaid in the yeare 1261. made and set out a <HI>provincial Constitution</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Cap. Item Sta|tuimus de poenis. in Provincial.</NOTE> commanding and in|joyning Bishops in their Diocesses to erect and have one or more Prison or Prisous for the safe keeping of Clergy-ma|lefactors. Providing withall that if any Clerke be so incor|rigible, and accustomed to commit wickednesse, such as for which, if he were a lay-man, he should by the lawes of the land suffer death, that he shall be adjudged to perpe|tuall imprisonment, &amp;c. This <HI>Constitution,</HI> whether for want of execution, or because it was not penall enough, did not afterwards generally serve turne to keepe Clerkes within compasse, as may be gathered out of the very se|cond Statute <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">3. Ed. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE> that makes mention of this priviledge. For there, to the end the King should not need to provide any other remedy therein, he admonisheth and enjoyneth the Prelates, upon the faith which they owe to him, and
<PB N="493" REF="272">
for the common profit and peace of the Realme, that Clerkes convict of fellony delivered over to the Ordinary shall not be delivered without due purgation: which argu|eth a remissnesse this way in Ordinaries in former time. This Stat. being made in the yeare 1275. within three yeares after, namely <HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1278. the Prelates assem|bled in Convocation, consult, conclude upon and make a <HI>Constitution</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Cap. Clerici de Purgatio. Canon. in Provincial.</NOTE> providing against the too-easie enlargement of criminous Clerkes, and the admission of slight and slen|der purgations for them, and injoyning a solemnity and wary exactnesse to be used therein, so that no occasion of offence be offered to the King or his Ministers through the non observance of this <HI>Constitution.</HI> Had not both these last mentioned Stat. and Constit. laine neglected without execution, as it should seeme (by the preamble of the Stat. 23. <HI>H. 8. c.</HI> 1.) they did, they might haply have beene the last that needed to have beene made of this nature. But because they wrought not that good effect which was ho|ped and expected, therefore in the 25. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. ano|ther Stat. <HI>(viz. c.</HI> 4.) is inacted, and (as I gather by it) up|on this occasion, <HI>viz.</HI> Because that Clerkes were suffered, by Ordinaries, upon slight purgations, to be inlarged and dismissed to their incouragement to offend againe, there|fore the secular Magistrats debarred them their Clergy, and <HI>sine delectu personarum,</HI> punished them and lay men all alike. Now complaint being made here of in Parliament by the Prelates, this Stat. was agreed upon and made, whereby for redresse of the injury offered to the Church and Church-men, provision is first made for the priviledge of it and them, and then insueth a promise made in their be|halfe by the then Archbishop of <HI>Cant. (Simon Islep)</HI> to the King, that he will make a convenient Ordinance, where|by Clericall offenders delivered to the Ordinaries shall be safely kept and duely punished, so that no Clerke shall take courage to offend for default of correction. The perfor|mance of which his promise you shall finde recorded and testified by a Successor of his the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Antiquitates
<PB N="494" REF="273">
Britannicae,</HI> in the life of the same <HI>Simon pag.</HI> 244. under the yeare of Grace 1351. As also by <HI>Harpsfield</HI> in his <HI>Eccles. Hist. p.</HI> 532. whose severe Constitution made in that behalfe; if you desire to see, although you will not finde it (I know not why) incorporated into <HI>Lindwoods Provincial,</HI> yet is it extant amongst the Provinciall Constitutions placed and annexed at the latter end of the Legatine Constitutions, in some Bookes (in mine <HI>Fol.</HI> 150.) I must therefore why the Stat. 4. <HI>H. 4. c.</HI> 3. should about 50. yeares after the date of it, call for such a Constitution, as if it had beene yet un|made, and the old promise of the Archbishop not hitherto performed. For so the Stat. intimates, in so much as the then Archbishop <HI>Thomas Arundell</HI> was faine to renew the promise in Parliament, which notwithstanding was neither by himselfe nor by any other succeeding Archbishop per|formed, as is testified and avouched by the forecited Stat. 23. <HI>H. 8. c.</HI> 1. And thus much of the first part of the <HI>Apo|phthegme. Immunitas peperit impunitatem.</HI></P>
<P>Great now had the patience of the King and State beene in expecting the reformation of such abuses as grew by reason of this ecclesiasticall priviledge, and a long time had the secular arme forborne to apply a temporall, but more terrible remedie and animadversion. So that now, sith neither the former Constitutions of the Church could keepe the Clergie in awe (as indeed how is it likely they should, the Authors of them not having <HI>gladii potestatem</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Duaren. De sacr. eccles. mi|nister. &amp; benef. lib. 1. c. 4.</NOTE>?) neither the ingeminated threats of applying a temporall remedy to curbe their extravagancies, would make them and others, partakers with them in their priviledge, to be|ware, it was now high time to clip the wings of this master|lesse liberty by restraint. For untill the fourth yeare of <HI>H.</HI> 7. we shall finde no Act of Parliament that hath any whit dero|gated or taken away from this priviledge. But then (which brings on the latter part of the Apophthegme. <HI>Filia devora|vit matrem)</HI> because that in confidence and trust of the priviledge of the Church, divers persons had beene the more bold to commit murder, rape, robbery, theft and all
<PB N="495" REF="273">
other mischeivous deeds, because they have beene con|tinually admitted to the benefit of the Clergie, as often as they did offend in any of the premisses (as the preamble of the Stat. 4. <HI>H. 7, c.</HI> 13. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">unneth) therefore, for avoiding of such boldnesse, it is enacted that the benefit of Clergie shall be but once allowed to any person not being within orders, and that convicted persons (to the end, as I sup|pose, it may be knowne whether they have had their Cler|gie once before, or not) shall be marked with the letter <HI>M.</HI> for murder, or <HI>F.</HI> for any other fellony, and that to be done openly in the Court, before he be delivered to the Ordinary. Thus for Lay-clerkes. Now for Clerkes in or|ders, it also provides, that if upon their second asking of their Clergie, they have not their letters of orders, or a certificate from their Ordinary witnessing the same, ready to show, or doe produce the one or the other by a day given them by the Justices to bring them in, then to loose the benefit of their Clergie as he shall doe that is without or|ders.</P>
<P>This Act (it should appeare) was not strict enough to bridle the insolencies of some Clergie-men and others that bare themselves upon the priviledge of Clergie. In the 23^t^h yeare therefore of the next King <HI>(H.</HI> 8.) his reigne, the Parliament having in the preamble of the Stat. 23. <HI>ejusd. H. cap.</HI> 1. enumerated many severall promises iterated and made by the prelates to take course within themselves, and by their owne power and authority without any need of the States, helpe to suppresse the insolencies of such male|factors, as upon confidence of Clergy dared the commit|ting of almost whatsoever foule enormities and outrages, and declared how these promises were frustrate and came to none effect, and withall complained of the many abuses of Ordinaries in and about purgations. For remedy, they inact that Clergy shall be taken quite away from all persons that are not within holy orders, which shall commit petit treason, Wilfull murder, and many the like fellonies. And as for persons in orders, none (saith the Statute) that shall
<PB N="496" REF="274">
be convict of any the fellonies therein mentioned shall be suffered to make purgation before his Ordinary, but shal re|maine and abide in perpetuall prison under the keeping of the Ordinarie, unlesse he become bound with sureties (such as the Stat. there alloweth and accepteth of) for his good abearing, with certaine other clauses and provisoes. A|mongst which one is for the degrading of Clerkes convict, and sending them to the Kings bench, there to suffer judge|ment to dye, as lay-men. You see this priviledge now brought pretty low, yet it stoopes lower, and now comes to be almost quite eclipsed. For besides many severall Acts of Parliament <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">23. H. 8. c. 11. &amp; 25. H. 8. c. 3. &amp; 5.</NOTE> betweene the last spoken of, and the 28. <HI>H. 8. c.</HI> 1. taking it away from divers sorts of fellonies. By this Act of 28. <HI>H.</HI> 8. 1. Clerkes in orders are brought un|der the same paines and penalties that others be, which be|ing but temporall, and made to endure onely unto the last day of the next Parliament, when that time came about, was by the Stat. 32. <HI>H. 8. cap.</HI> 3. as good and beneficiall for the common wealth made perpetuall. By which lact Act, over and above, in expresse words, it is decreed that Clerkes in orders, in such manner as lay-clerkes are wont to be, shall be burnt in the hand for such fellonies as they may or ought to have their Clergie for.</P>
<P>This priviledge being brought thus low rose up no more. For after the last mentioned Stat. came that of 1. <HI>Ed. 6. c.</HI> 12. whereas large an enumeration is made what offences shall exclude their Authors of their Clergie, as in the for|mer. It suffered yet daily further restraint. For afterwards Statutes upon Statutes, one at the heele, and in the necke of another take it from this and tother offender, as <HI>Rastals Kalender,</HI> in <HI>verbo Clergy</HI> will fully direct, as also will <HI>Lam|bards Eirenarcha. pag.</HI> 540. and so forward, to which I referre you. For
<Q><L>Conveniunt cymba vela minoramea.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, to set before you that which principally hath devested and outed the Church of her Jurisdiction over such as were and are to reape benefit by this priviledge, and
<PB N="497" REF="274">
to shew unto you how the ancient course of the law in the point of delivering Clerkes to their Ordinaries to be pur|ged, came to be altered. I have to acquaint you that the Stat. of 18. <HI>Eliz. c.</HI> 6. (the causes and motives for making whereof are in the preamble expressed, amongst the rest, to be these, <HI>viz.</HI> the avoyding of sundry perjuries and other abuses in and about the purgation of Clerkes convict deli|vered to the Ordinaries) hath quite taken away purgation, untill that time ever accustomed, ordaining withall that no man, that shall be allowed his Clergie, shall be commit|ted to the Ordinary, but presently enlarged (after allow|ance of Clergy and burning in the hand:) Providing never|thelesse that the Justices, for the Offenders further cor|rection, may retaine him in prison for a time. Thus have you seene how this priviledge hath declined and beene brought downe to the present despicable condition where|in it is with us at this day. Remaines so meane, as by them the once flourishing estate of it will hardly gaine beleefe. Truely then
