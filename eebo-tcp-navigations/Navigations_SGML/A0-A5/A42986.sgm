<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Love is to thee, and thy Wife, de&s;iring your wellfare, both inward and outward; and that we may be found &s;teadfa&s;t in that truth which is &s;aving, for the wellfare of our immor|tall Souls; And dear Friend, the de&s;ire of my Soul is, that we may know true Love; and I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee thee and thy Wife; I have partly a rememberance of thy Wife; And I have thought on thee many times with tears in my eyes, and the Lord hath done wonderous works for me; unto him I return thanks &amp; prai&s;es, who is God over all Ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</P>
<P>Now Friend, I &s;hall give thee &s;omthing of an infor|mation concerning <HI>New Jer&s;ie,</HI> but time will not permit me to write at length. Thou de&s;ire&s;t to know how I live, through the goodne&s;s of the Lord I live very well, keeping between 30 and 40 head of Cows, and 7 or 8 Hor&s;es or Mares to Ride upon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are 7 Towns &s;ettled in this Province, <HI>(viz.) Shrew&s;bury</HI> and <HI>Midletown,</HI> upon the Sea &s;ide, and along the River &s;ide and up the Creeks there is <HI>Pi&s;cattaway,</HI> &amp; <HI>Woodbridge, Elizobetown, New wake, and Bergane;</HI> mo&s;t of the&s;e Towns having about 100 Famileis; and the lea&s;t 40. The Country is very healthful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In <HI>Middletown,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">where I live, in 6 years and upwards there have dyed but one Woman about 80 years old, one Man about 60, a Boy about five years old, and one little Infant or 2: there are in this Town, in twenty five Families a|bout 95 children mo&s;t of them under 12 years of age, and all lu&s;ty children. The produce of this Province, is chiefly Wheat, Barly, Oates, Beans, Beef, Pork, Pea&s;e, To|bacco, <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, Butter, Chee&s;e, Hemp, &amp; flax, French-beans, Strawberries, Carrots, Par&s;nips, Cabbidge, Turnips Radi&s;hes, Onions, Cucumbers, Water-mellons, Musk|mellons, Squa&s;hes; al&s;o our &s;oil is very fertile for Apples, Pears, Plums, Quinces, Currans red and white, Goo&s;eberries, Cherries, and Peaches in abundance, having all &s;orts of green tra&s;h in the Summer time, &amp; the Country is greatly &s;upplied with Creeks &amp; Rivers which afford &s;tore of Fi&s;h, Pearch, Roach, Ba&s;te, Sheeps-head, Oy&s;ters, Clams, Crabs, Sturgeon, Eels, and many other &s;orts of Fi&s;h that I do not name;. you may Buy as much Fi&s;h of an <HI>Indian</HI> for half a pound of Powder, as will &s;erve 6 or 8 men; Deer are al&s;o very plenty in this Province; we can buy a fat Buck of the <HI>Indians</HI> much bigger than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Deer for a pound and half of Powder, or Lead, or any other trade equivalent, and a peck of Strawberries, the <HI>Indians</HI> will gather, and bring Home to us for the value of 6 <HI>d.</HI> and our Beef and Pork is very fat and good; the natural Gra&s;s of the Country is much like that which grows in the Woods in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which is food enough for our Cattle; but by the water &s;ide we have fre&s;h meadows &amp; &s;alt Mar&s;hes; we make good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bread and Beer; be&s;ides we have &s;everall other &s;orts of Drink; and travelling in the Country, and coming to any Hou&s;e, they generally ask
<PB N="3" REF="3">you to eat &amp; drink, and take Tobacco, and their &s;everal &s;orts of drink they will offer you as confidently as if it were Sack. Here are abundance of Che&s;nuts, Walnuts, Mulberries, and Grapes, red and white, our Hor&s;es and Mares run in the Woods, and we give them no meat Winter nor Summer, unle&s;s we work them; but our Cows mu&s;t be looked after; our Timber &s;tands for fences about the Land we manure; we plough our Land with Oxen for the mo&s;t part; a Husband-man here and in old <HI>England</HI> is all one, making mo&s;t of our utencils for Husbandry our &s;elves, and a man that has 3 or 4 Sons or Servants that can work along with him, will down with Timber amain, and get Corn quickly. The be&s;t coming to this Country, is at the Spring or Fall, we make our Soap &amp; Candles, &amp; all &s;uch things our &s;elves; in the Winter we make good fires, and eat good meat; and our Women &amp; Children are healthy; Sugar is cheap; Veni&s;on, Gee&s;e, Turkies, Pidgeons, Fowle, &amp; Fi&s;h plenty; and one great happine&s;s we enjoy, which is, we are very quiet. I could give thee more information concerning this Country, but time will not give leave, In &s;hort, this is a rare place for any poor man, or others; and I am &s;atisfied people may live better here then they do in Old <HI>England,</HI> and eat more good meat <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Ve&s;&s;el is going away, I have not time to coppy this over; therefore take the &s;en&s;e of it, my Love &s;alutes thee, farewel,</P>
