<HEAD>THE FRENCH and SPANISH FLEET Arrived at Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>THe French-men having great and plenary intelligence of the Papi&s;ts proceedings in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after long debate and private confe+deracy concerning the &s;ame effect, they &s;ent with|out any intermi&s;&s;ion of longer time a Herauld of Armes to <HI>Tyrone</HI> (that Arch-rebell in <HI>Ireland</HI> cer|tifying him, that if they were defective, or had any need of auxiliary a&s;si&s;tance, they would in&s;tantly conjoyne with unanimity, and defend their party with con&s;tant pui&s;&s;ance, Whereupon <HI>Tyrone</HI> grati|ou&s;ly returned an An&s;wer, that he was much re&s;pe|ctive towards them, and promi&s;ed the uttermo&s;t of their intents, and indeavours to performe the be&s;t courte&s;ie for their &s;o gratious a Me&s;&s;age con|cerning the demolition of prote&s;tant Religion, and withall be&s;eeched, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ted them to rai&s;e &s;ome &s;udden force, and to &s;end a Navie with great expedition unto them, that they might fully &s;ubdue the whole kingdome of <HI>Ireland.</HI> This Em|ba&s;&s;age being re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">urned, they (after mature, and &s;eri|ous
<PB REF="3"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">long and conected with a re|gular aggregation the number of &s;ixe thou&s;and men of Arms to goe &s;peedily into <HI>Ireland,</HI> with 9 &s;hips fully loaden with Armes, Ammunition, and &s;trong fortification for the &s;ame purpo&s;e and intent. And being thus provided for <HI>Ireland,</HI> they &s;eemed to go on with great alacrity, untill they came to the full ohject of their unanimous expectation: where they were very nobly entertained, and with great favour and affectionate re&s;pection. Wherefore they being landed at the Port of <HI>Cavarre</HI> marched on &s;till, un|till they came beyond the <HI>Territories</HI> of that king|dome to <HI>Armagh,</HI> where they began a promi&s;cuous rnd tumultuous clamar among the people, &s;laying, and de&s;troying whom&s;oever they could meet with, of what &s;ect, degree, or Age &s;oever.</P>
<P>When as they met with the Rebels, they had great and &s;ingular congratulation, who immediatly conducted them with great expedition to that fa|mous, renowned, and honourable City of Dublin, who incontinently be&s;ieged the &s;ame, and mo&s;t ty|rannically a&s;&s;aulted, when&s;oever they met.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Ca&s;tle of Dublin they intended to take the eighteenth day of December, and without any humane partiality they did put the poore prote|&s;tants to the intolerable mi&s;erie, and deplorable ca|lamitie.</P>
<P>There was great and unexpected &s;olemnity, tri|umph, and celebration at the French fleet arrived in

<HEAD>The Spani&s;h Fleet arrived in Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Patricke Devons</HI> collected a numerous mul|titude out of <HI>Spaine</HI> to goe into <HI>Ireland,</HI> for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;aid Papi&s;ts there congregated, and plotting the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of true Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>He had under his command five thou&s;and men in Armes, who came in a Navie into <HI>Ireland</HI> to the auxiliation of the rebels.</P>
<P>Where at their arrivall, Tyrone and his confede|rats joyfully entertained him. The cau&s;e of their fir&s;t commotion, and furious in&s;urrection was this.</P>
<P>The Popes <HI>Nuntio</HI> tran&s;ported &s;uch Newes into <HI>Spaine,</HI> that his &s;upremacie was plea&s;ed to &s;upplant the Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> and all their Adherents: and becau&s;e they were Hereticks.
<PB REF="4">Therefore his Primacie wold vouch&s;afe to depo&s;e them all. After this Nuncio's me&s;&s;age reported to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> he impo&s;ed, and committed all the &s;ub&s;equent to Sir <HI>Patrick Devons</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who immediately by the command of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> went under the conduct of 5000. &s;ouldiers, who ar|riving at the Iri&s;h Coa&s;t were royally entertained by &s;ome of the chiefe of the Rebels.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed to be very inhumane, and withall they tooke a private Oath among them&s;elves, that what&s;oever Prote&s;tant they &s;hould meer, or any inclining to the Prote&s;tant Religion, hee or they &s;hould be incontinently &s;laine without any partia|lity at all, and he or they, or any of them that &s;hould deny the &s;ame &s;huld be expel'd as a traytor to their party. Thus they proceeded in their vnchri&s;tian and tyrannicall &s;laughter, putting all to the &s;word, that they could meet obviou&s;ly of the Prote&s;tant religi|on and profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;ee therefore, and may apparently perceive how bloudily the&s;e rebels proceed in their cruelty and therefore we ought not to &s;leepe in the chaires of &s;ecurity, and &s;uffer our poore Brethren to &s;uffer there in great violation, and mi&s;erable calamity,</P>
<P>For &s;ecuritie is the very doore that opens the ve|ry plaine way to de&s;truction. And I pray God whil&s;t many of us doe thinke our &s;elves &s;afe on the &s;leeping beds of &s;ecurity, that the enemy doth not cut our throats.</P>
<P>While E&s;au prolonged the time, Jacob &s;tole away his birth-right: And I pray God, while were
<PB REF="4">procraitinate and deferre the time in helping out <HI>Brethren</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that a forreine enemy doe not &s;teale away the renowned Prerogative of this Kingdome, and &s;o con&s;equently it become a con|quered Nation.</P>
<P>While the men in the holy Go&s;pell &s;lept, the Enemy &s;owed tares among&s;t the wheat, and I am &s;ure while we neglect the proper time, many teares of Di&s;cord, and &s;chi&s;maticall di&s;&s;ention are &s;owne among&s;t us. But I hope that God, who heretofore have alwayes defended, and pre&s;erved this King|dome of his &s;ingular mercy, and favourable omni|potencie, will &s;till defend the &s;ame for ever, to the propagation of his Truth and Go&s;pell.</P>
