<P>THE News of General <HI>Schomberg</HI>'s &s;afe Arrival in <HI>Ireland,</HI> being a thing of &s;uch Publick Concern and Joy, it is thought a piece of Service to the Publick, to give a faithful Narrative of his Happy Voyage from <HI>Highlake</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Circum&s;tances that attended the &s;ame; which are as followeth:</P>
<P>His Excellency having here prepar'd all things for this Expedition, and Shipped his Men on Board, &s;ent away the Artillery-Ships, with &s;ome Draught-Hor&s;es before, to the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> intending to Rendevouz there. He him&s;elf Embarqued on the 11th In&s;tant, and as &s;oon as he came on Board, he called all the chief Officers together, and held a Coun|cil about the fitte&s;t place of his Landing; which being re&s;olved on, and on <HI>Munday</HI> Morning, the 12th in&s;tant, the Wind blowing fair, at <HI>N. E.</HI> by Twelve a Clock they weighed Anchor, and &s;tood out to Sea: The Weather was very fair; &s;o that towards Night it was concerted, whether they &s;hould go to their Rendevouz at the <HI>I&s;le of Man;</HI> but con|&s;idering afterwards the uncertainty of meeting with &s;o fair an opportu|nity; and being al&s;o loath to delay any longer the Succouring that di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Country, it was re&s;olved to continue their Cour&s;e directly, and afterwards to &s;end for their Artillery-Ships. The Wind continued &s;till &s;o fair, as that on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning they &s;pied the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and about Ten they came up to the I&s;lands of <HI>Laune</HI> and <HI>Copland,</HI> two little I&s;lands at the Mouth of <HI>Carrick-Fergus</HI> Bay.</P>
<P>Here they lay by for two Hours, till their Spy Boats brought them word, That they &s;aw Three French Men of War in the Bay: Upon which Intelligence our Men of War immediately prepar'd to attack them, and leaving their Convoy, went up to meet them; which they did, near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Carrick-Fergus,</HI> and there engaged them &s;o warmly, as that in Four Hours time they overcame them, taking Two, and &s;inking the Third; as al&s;o &s;ome little Boats which tended on them. The&s;e were tho&s;e Ships which took the Two Scotch Frigats, who defended them|&s;elves &s;o bravely. While this Action la&s;ted, the Iri&s;h were &s;o allarum'd
<PB N="2" REF="2">at the &s;ight of &s;uch a Fleet, as that they immediately &s;et Fire to the Town, and blow'd up part of the Ca&s;tle: But the General &s;o timely prevented the fury of the Flames, by &s;ome Boats full of Men which he landed, as that part of the Town was pre&s;erved: Al&s;o, at the &s;ame time he &s;ent up &s;everal Boats arm'd to <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> (which lies at the bottom of the Bay) and thereby &s;ecured that place from their Fury: For at their approach the Iri&s;h quitted the place, and fled in great confu&s;ion and di&s;|order into the Country. However at Night they perceived &s;everal Fires in all parts of the Country, which whether they were Beacons to give Notice of the Landing, or Hou&s;es and Towns on Fire, was not then known.</P>
<P>The General him&s;elf landed at <HI>Carrick Fergus,</HI> which is a large Town, Seven Miles from <HI>Belfa&s;t;</HI> they are both in the County of <HI>Antrim:</HI> The latter is Sixty Miles from <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and the like di&s;tance from <HI>Enniskilling,</HI> lying in a Triangular Figure, which does take in all the North, and &s;ecure that Province from the Iri&s;h. So that when the Forces are joined, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed they will march directly to <HI>Dublin,</HI> which is about Seventy Miles from the place of Landing. We &s;hall now every day expect to here of Action; unle&s;s the natural Ba&s;hfulne&s;s of the Iri&s;h before the Face of an Enemy, prevent us, longer than we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> there Sailed out of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> an Hundred Sail of Ships, laded with Men, and Ammunition, who intend to joyn the General.</P>
<P>I have here enclo&s;ed a Li&s;t of tho&s;e Regiments that went with him; and al&s;o of tho&s;e which were to follow him; the re&s;t will Sail this Week.</P>
