<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>GOD by his wi&s;e, mighty, and wonderfull provi|dence, in &s;uch fa&s;hion governeth the world, that hee doth furni&s;h every nation, with what hee knows to bee mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and convenient for them. This our nation of North Britaine, in all former ages, was e&s;teemed and known to be as wi&s;e and valiant in minde, &s;o health full in body; while now that by intemperan|cie, the gut, gravell, the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;plene, the hypo|chondriak melancholy, with many other terrible uncouth, cruel and mon&s;truous maladies are come in ready to under|mine and de&s;troy us, if God of his great mercy, had not re|vealed to this nation that excellent &s;pring, and water of health, which I thus di&s;covered, being at London, with that hopefull gentleman <HI>Iames Scot,</HI> &s;on to my <HI>L.</HI> of
<HI>Scots-tar|vet,</HI> who was he avily troubled with a di&s;ea&s;e, which the chief|e&s;t and greate&s;t Phy&s;icians in that place, called a
<HI>Carno&s;itie in the urinall pa&s;&s;age,</HI> (though it proved in end to be a very hard one, and turned in a &s;tone) the which to cure, they applyed many good and laudable medicaments, without prevailing any thing again&s;t his di&s;ea&s;e. At length de&s;pairing of health: he is &s;ent to the waters of Tunbridge, as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">s la&s;t refuge. With whom among&s;t others I went: where, by the u&s;e of the&s;e waters, his paine was mitigate and aboundance of &s;limy hu|mors voyded: from thence he went to Paris, where he was cu|red, and ordained to go to the Well of Spaw in Germany, and from thence to Knesbrough in England: by the u&s;e of all which waters, he is come to be expert, and to have full know|ledge, of the nature and vertues of &s;uch minerall waters.</P>
<P>In the mean time of the&s;e voyages, my &s;tudy was of that
<PB REF="3">kinde of fountains: remembring from my childhood, in &s;ome kinde, the affinity of the ta&s;te of the Well of Peter-head, with that which I did finde in thole Wells, whereof now I have &s;poken, I re&s;olved to come and try the vertues and ope|ration, of that Well. Which fir&s;t the inhabitants of that town of Peter-head manife&s;ted to me, by their relation of its curing of &s;ore eyes, loo&s;ing of the belly, if bound, &amp; &s;top|ping the immoderate cour&s;e thereof, &s;erving to them for a cup of preparation before dinner, with many other &s;uch like experiences: as one, which I think not ami&s;&s;e to in&s;ert in this place of an old, ancient, grave man of 76. years experience, yet living, who diver&s;e and often times hath told me, that he him&s;elf being u&s;ually troubled with &s;and and &s;tones in the kidneys, u&s;ed many kindes of drogues, to free him from this fearfull and con&s;uming de&s;ea&s;e: at la&s;t being vehemently vexed with paine, took &s;ome 5. or 6. draughts of this water, after which, there bur&s;t out with his urine, great quantitie of &s;and and &s;tones. Which water thus he did drink 8 dayes altogether, every morning, with the like effects, and hath never been troubled hithertils, with &s;o vehement paine.</P>
<P>Another in that &s;ame town, who voyded his &s;tomach of a &s;tone, bigger then a tennis ball <HI>per anum,</HI> and I think it was, the great antipathie which this water hath again&s;t &s;tones or &s;and, in all places of the body, that made him &s;o evacuate &s;uch a mon&s;trous thing as this.</P>
<P>Yet not content to know the truth hereof, and that the vertues of this water were great by &s;ome experiences: I in|tended to dive in the deepe&s;t of this fountaine, by the ordi|nary tryals of &s;uch waters: as the drawing of the tincture of a nutgall, which it will do in the twinckling of an eye, with many other pretty little tryals of that &s;ort: as in all of them it proved excellent.</P>
<P>Neither yet confident of my own tryals, I carryed the wa|ter of this &s;ource, to the &s;ource and fountain, from whence my fir&s;t knowledge in medicine did &s;low: and from whom, many in this nation have received the mo&s;t part of their <PB REF="4">knowledge, both divine and Philo&s;ophicall, which water was keept half year, then tried and found neither changed in ta&s;te nor &s;mell, as yet it remaineth in that &s;ame &s;tate after two years: and by his advi&s;e, information, and ordinance I cau&s;ed pur this clear, pure whole&s;ome water in a ve&s;&s;ell, which after a little boyling, was coagulate in a red or brow|ni&s;h tincture. (like that of Plin. chap. 2. lib. 3, <HI>Tungria, ci|vitas Galliae, fontem habet in&s;ignem, plurimis bullis stillantem, ferruginei &s;aporis, quod ip&s;um non ni&s;i in fine potus intelligitur. Purgat hic corpora, tertianas febres di&s;cutit, calculorumque vitia. Eadem aqua igni admota, turbida fit, ac po&s;tremo ru|be&s;cit.</HI>) In the bottome of which ve&s;&s;el, after evaporation remained a red kinde of matter, like unto <HI>colcothar,</HI> which was calcined, pulveri&s;ed, and di&s;&s;olved with common water: the water being &s;eparate from the &s;ediment by inclination, and evaporate there remained in the bottome a perfect vi|triol, of a greeni&s;h colour, and of ta&s;te &s;harp and &s;weet: the vitriol by concoction within the earth, having turned its cor|ro&s;ive acrimonie, in a good &s;weet aciditie, <HI>ideo aquae therma|les omnes, qua &s;olutam vitrioli materiam fixam, eamque cocta~ &amp; &s;ubdulcem, &s;ine &s;uo humido complectuntur, caeteris omnibus prae&s;tant: quod materia illa fixa vitrioli, humido radicali fixo auri &amp; argenti respondeat, cui infinitas occultas virtutes in|e&s;&s;e tota credidit antiquitas. inquit Fabet. Cap.</HI> 17.
<HI>Pallad. &s;pag.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ediment which remained after &s;eparation of the wa|ter by inclination, being again tried in the fire, proved to be a confu&s;ed ma&s;&s;e of not perfectly cancocted mettals.</P>
<P>But none can &s;peak more by experience, of the goodne&s;&s;e and vertue of this fountaine, then the gentleman, I have named, and another gentleman of good worth, <HI>M. Thomas Aikinhead,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ar of Edinburgh, who in Augu&s;t la&s;t, <HI>An.</HI> 1635. did find in this Well, as much worth, as they found in any of the forementioned exotick Wells, having tryed both. And not only tho&s;e, but many other gentlemen of good re&s;pect can te&s;tifie the&s;e things to be true, which in this booke, I have written, concerning the medicinall vertues of this <PB REF="4">fountaine: which, good reader, I hope you may patiently read, and thank God; if, di&s;ea&s;ed, you reap any benefit from hence.</P>
<P>Neither had I intention to have publi&s;hed this treati&s;e be|ing con&s;cious of my own weakne&s;&s;e, if I had not been ani|mated and encouraged thereto by a letter, which I receaved from my learned Ma&s;ter, whom I &s;hall reverence, with a filial re&s;pect &s;o long as breath &s;hall delay to expire.</P>

<HEAD>S. PETERS WELL, <HI>OR</HI> THE WELL OF Peter-head.</HEAD>
<P>MEdicinall waters differ much in &s;a|vour and ta&s;te: &s;ome of them being &s;ulfureous, &s;ome vitriolate, &s;ome &s;alti&s;h: yet all of them
<HI>communi nomine</HI> are called <HI>acidi,</HI> from the ta&s;te: which acidity or &s;harpne&s;&s;e comes partly from vitrioll and partly from the &s;alt of minerals: or they are called mine|rall waters becau&s;e pa&s;&s;ing through the con|cavities of the earth, they carry with the~ the tinctures of what they renconter, and are im|pregnate with the quinte&s;&s;ence of tho&s;e mi|nerals by which they pa&s;&s;e whether it bee <HI>terra lemnia, bol. armen. chalk:</HI> or congeled liquors an juyces, as <HI>allome, &s;uccin, &s;ulphur, nitre, vitriol &amp;c.</HI> or mettals, as gold, &s;ilver, yron, &amp;c. or &s;tones as chri&s;tall, marble, load-&s;tone &amp;c: they are al&s;o called medici|nall waters for their rare and admirable ver|tues in curing di&s;ea&s;es and pre&s;erving of <PB REF="6">health. Many of the&s;e waters are found out by the diligent &s;earching and indu&s;trious la|bour of the learned, endevouring to find out the &s;ecrets of nature mo&s;t ea&s;ie for the help of mankind; as the wel of Spaw in Germany, the wells of Burbon, of Pouges, of For|ges in France, of Porrecta in Italy, of Tun|bridge, and Knesbrough, in England with many others of infinite vertues, as Plinius recordeth in many pa&s;&s;ages of his books, e|&s;pecially in the 2. chap. of his 31. book. And I would that any reader who doubts of the excellent vertues of infinite diver&s;ity of waters &s;hould read that chapter: And now our waters of Peter-head called be our fore|fathers Saint Peters wel thinking that it was S. Peter that &s;ent from Rome a facultie of curing di&s;ea&s;es to the&s;e waters, becau&s;e hee him&s;elf could not come, being imployed a|bout more nece&s;&s;ary affaires at Rome, for the time Pope. Wherefore to gratify this holy Apo&s;tle they have built a temple, which to this day is called S. Peters church. They u&s;ed to come to the well on S. Peters day, a&s;&s;emb|ling them&s;elves in great mulitudes; on which <PB REF="6">day as yet we have a great faire at this place. But this is meer &s;uper&s;tition, like that of the heathen, who as Plinius te&s;tifieth lib. 31. chap. 2. denominate their rare and medici|nall waters from diver&s;e of there gods.</P>
<P>S. Peters well may be compared with Spaw waters, being nothing inferiour to them in medicinal vertues, and far excells any other as yet found out, in Europe.</P>
<P>It is certain that this Petrean water (for &s;o hereafter &s;hal it be called) pa&s;&s;es through minerals: but with what proportion they are mixed in the&s;e &s;ubterranean cells, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to know, or whether it be hote or cold, moi&s;t or dry, &s;ome thinges from whence it flows being hote, &s;ome cold, &s;ome temperate, &s;eeming rather that it is tempe|rate, well mixed, as its effects &s;hows: yet al|wayes this water while it is drunken hume|ctates and refrigerates, incontinent, being daunted through the heat of the &s;tomach, heats and dryes.</P>
<P>For the vertues of our water: it clean&s;eth and wa&s;teth vi&s;cide &amp; Tartareous humors, extenuats pituite, it voyds the liver, melt,
<PB REF="7">me&s;araicks, and other our entrails, of what|&s;oever ob&s;tructions is trouble&s;ome to them: it &s;trengthens the &s;tomach &s;o, be its a&s;tricti|on, that none can complain of harme by its actuall coldne&s;&s;e: It gives &s;trength to the nerves, tempers the heat of the kidneys, clean&s;ing and expelling their gravell, &s;and and &s;tones more forceably then any other medicament, becau&s;e it is diuretick, &s;imple, naturall, voyd of all arte, made by the hand of God alone, and mo&s;t gracious to the ta&s;te it hinders the concretion or coagulation of &s;and, re&s;i&s;ting the generation of confirmed &s;tones; and if confirmed, dimini&s;hes them: it purgeth the bladder and mundifies the &s;tone of vi&s;cide pituit and muco&s;itie wherewith it is environed, prepairing it to be ea&s;ily ta|ken out by cutting, it is mo&s;t profitable for the ulcer of the reins and carno&s;ities in the urinal pa&s;&s;age, ca&s;t in be injection: it certain|ly helps the venerean &amp; Virulent Gonorhea and all other di&s;ea&s;es of that &s;ort, applyed with out for their ulcers, chancres, poula|nes, pu&s;tules, within by injection, and po|tion, it helps the concoction of the &s;tomach, <PB REF="7">quenches thir&s;t, appea&s;es dolours, throwing of the belly, with Colick and Iliack pa&s;&s;ions: it purifies the bloud, kills and expells all kynd of wormes, cha&s;es away all fevers, clean&s;es the skin of pu&s;tles and skabs, be lo|tion &amp; bathing, it lou&s;es the belly, if bound, taking away the ob&s;tructions from the gal, which &s;ends forth its choler or <HI>bilis</HI> the on|ly <HI>&s;timulus foecum in jejunum inte&s;tinum,</HI> wherewith being &s;harpned, ca&s;ts out the foe|ces therein contained, it re&s;traines the fluxes of the belly, by corroborating the retentive facultie, drying the inte&s;tins, and makes them &s;low to expell the humors being drawn by the force of the water to the reins and bladder, and &s;o it works proportiona|bly according to the nece&s;&s;ity of nature, as an excellent in&s;trument appointed by Gods providence for the health of mankinde.</P>
<P>They al&s;o carry with them out of the body diver&s;e wayes, the cold and watry bloud with other excrementitious humors of choler, pituite, melancholy. Our <HI>Hydropo|tae</HI> pi&s;&s;e much their expul&s;ive facultie being helped through the diuretick quality of our <PB REF="8">water, their gro&s;&s;e excrements are black or greeni&s;h: becau&s;e the &s;alt of minerals be its precipitating vertue <HI>facit de&s;eendere terre|&s;treitatem ad fundum:</HI> &s;ome vomites, voyding their &s;tomach of &s;uperfluous humors, &s;ome &s;weats &s;ending forth their ob&s;tructions by the pores: for all diuretick things are al&s;o diaphoretick, the urine and &s;weat being of natures little different.</P>
<P>The&s;e clear pure waters gratious both to palate and eyes provoke &s;o many and divers evacuations, which &s;carce any medicament, grievous to the &s;mell, horrible to the &s;ight, and loath&s;ome to the ta&s;te, could effectuate: they agree with both &s;exes, all ages: re&s;tor|ing health lo&s;t: pre&s;erving in integritie the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Wee have u&s;ed all kynd of tryalls for ex|amination of the Petrean water; and have found (as we are able to demon&s;trate) that the&s;e waters carry with them the tincture of vitriol and of mettals not perfect nor al|together &s;olide; but crude begun, growing to a &s;olide mettall if every day a part were not carryed away with the waters.</P>
<PB REF="8">
<P>As for the vertues and qualities of vitriol, they are &s;o renowned by many of the ancients and all our moderne writers, that purpo&s;ely I omit them to a more fit occa&s;ion then the brevity of this peece can permit. And if I &s;hal but point at the generation of vitriol, within the earth the under&s;tanding reader &s;hall quickly perceave its nature and operation, which is thus.</P>
<P>There ari&s;eth a &s;ulfureous exhalation be the action of the &s;ubterranean heat: which mixed with water makes a &s;harp corro&s;ive juyce, proper to corrode and drink up a part of copper and yron, and to collect and coa|gulate it &s;elf in one; which we cal Vitriol. So that the principles and elements of vitriol are &s;ulfur, water, the two mettals of yron and copper, and &s;ome little portion of the minerall clay adhering either to the mettals, as &s;eldome they remain in the bowels of the earth without &s;ome &s;limy matter: or el&s;e in the water with which was mixed the &s;ulfu|reous &s;al&s;uginous exhalation, which things we &s;ee in the anatomy of vitriol be de&s;tillatio~ Fir&s;t the watry part being volatile, ari&s;eth in <PB REF="9">making of Colcothar, then that &s;ulfureous &s;al&s;uginous exhalation, which being by cold conden&s;ed in the recipient, turns in oyl: the
<HI>hypo&s;ta&s;is</HI> or &s;ediment being pulueri&s;ed, wa&s;hed dryed and liquified with <HI>borax, &s;e|cundum artem,</HI> &s;hall produce a metallick &s;ub|&s;tance. Out of which con&s;iderations <HI>A. Gun|therus</HI> hath defined it to be <HI>&s;ulfureae &s;al&s;uginis aeratae ferratae&abque; coagulum.</HI></P>
<P>And albeit evidently <HI>ad &s;en&s;um</HI> we can &s;ee no more mettals but copper and yron, yet certainly it is <HI>coagulum omnium metallorum autcorum &s;al.</HI> Whence &s;ome have taken occa|&s;ion to make an allu&s;ion to the letters of <HI>Vitriolum, Vi&s;itando interiora terrae rectifi|cando invenies occultum lapidem veram me|dicinam.</HI></P>
<P>As for the mettals, the Chimique Philo&s;o|phers &s;ay that their
<HI>proxima materia</HI> Mer|curie engendred of the fir&s;t matter of mine|rals well mixed: to wit, that vi&s;cous humi|ditie &s;ubtilly incorporate to incombu&s;tible earth equally mixed with the lea&s;t parts in the minerall concavities of the earth. And &s;eeing that kinde of matter can not produce
<PB REF="9">&s;elf, nature hath given it a proper agent <HI>&s;ul|phur,</HI> a certain fatne&s;&s;e of the earth, engend|red in its own bowels by temperate coction, for concocting, dige&s;ting and converting the for&s;aid Mercurie in forme of mettall, the &s;ulphur having relation to the mercurie, as the male to the female, and as the proper agent to its proper matter: this is <HI>proximae materia metallorum.</HI> As in the generation of man, the aliment is a nearer mater then the elements, the bloud then the food, the &s;eed then the bloud, and in end after a long and continuall dige&s;tion the matter receaves hu|mane forme: &s;o in the generation of mettals there ari&s;eth vapors of the elements, the&s;e vapors being conden&s;ed turn in a vi&s;cous and ponderous liquor mixed with &s;ubtile and &s;ulfureous earth, which is called mercu|rie, whereof as of its <HI>proxima materia,</HI> bee the mixtion and action of &s;ulphur, is made gold, &s;ilver, yron, or any other mettall according as nature hath dige&s;ted it le&s;&s;e or more: for there is no difference betwixt gold and yron, but that gold hath happened to bee better and longer concocted then the other.</P>

<P>Some &s;triving to imitate nature in perfect|ing of mettals, meaning to bring them to their perfection, Gold, have u&s;ed many arti|ficiall operations in making their Philo&s;o|phers &s;tone &s;o much &s;earched.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they calcine the matter without di|mini&s;hing the body, they attenuate the gro&s;|ne&s;&s;e and &s;olidity of the calcined matter by &s;olution, and reduce it to its <HI>prima materia,</HI> which they call minerall water, whereof gold is the father, &s;ilver the mother, and quick&s;ilver the <HI>proxeneta,</HI> that makes the ma|riage and union: this done they &s;eparate the foure elements in two parts, one &s;uperior and cele&s;tiall, which is the &s;pirit that quick|ens, another inferior and terre&s;triall which mu&s;t bee enlived by the &s;pirit making the combination with the &s;oule and body, for that fir&s;t part is a &s;oul in&s;pired: they conjoyn the water and aire with the earth, and fire, they putrifie the matter bee a moi&s;t heat, after putrefaction comes coagulation, ciba|tion, &s;ublimation, fermentation, exaltation, augmentation, and la&s;tly projection upon imperfect mettals, changing them into per|fect gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<PB REF="10">
<P>It is certain that the chief end of the an|cient Philo&s;ophers, who traveiled and la|boured about this &s;tone, was to compo&s;e an univer&s;all bal&s;amick medicine to roborate and con&s;erve the radicall bal&s;ame and nectar of our life, in a good and laudable tempera|ment: which great and incomparable medi|cine they &s;earched in minerals: and knowing that gold, the perfection of minerals, could not have action in our bodys: be rea&s;on of its compact and firme compo&s;ition: they have endevoured to break its harde&s;t bonds, and to reduce it to its fir&s;t matter, that it may be di&s;&s;olved in all liquors, and communicate to them that excellent and bal&s;amick perfecti|on of our life and nature.</P>
<P>The tran&s;mutation of mettals in the con|cavities of the earth appears evidently; but be artificiall projection many imaginations are not &s;trong enough to conceave, though &s;ome too &s;trongly conceave them, &amp; by thus conceaving have deceaved many of the world and them&s;elves: and it is thought be many that gold is not &s;o di&s;&s;olved bee any preparation as yet found out, that it renders <PB REF="11">any tincture worthy of the lea&s;t and &s;male&s;t part of the prai&s;es it receives. For <HI>in auro pota|bili, e&s;&s;entia auri, &s;ale auri,</HI> there are other ex|cellent things of more worth nor the gold, lurking in another forme reducible to the metallick &s;ub&s;tance, neither perchance is it to bee denyed, but there is in gold excellent vertues and &s;pecifick remedies for all kinde of di&s;ea&s;es: yea, more then in any other thing el&s;e, if the right and true preparation thereof were known, as it may bee future ages, more happy then wee &s;hall finde, and I pray GOD they that &s;pend their &s;pirit and expence herein, may better them&s;elves, and the world.</P>
<P>And it may be thought, if the ancients, or moderns had known that the tinctures of minerals were carryed from the concavities of the earth, with water, as in our Petrean fountain, they had never &s;o perplexed them|&s;elves to have tryed &s;o many &s;olutions, cal|cinations, coagulations, fixations, &s;ublima|tions, &amp;c. As they have done, evaporating their &s;pirits, and exhau&s;ting the <HI>humi&agrave;um radicale</HI> of their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<PB REF="11">
<P>Within the earth from whence our Pe|trean water flows, is a concavitie, a great ve&s;|&s;el, <HI>ampullare matratium capaci&s;simum,</HI> where|in is contained <HI>materia proxima metallorum:</HI> which &s;ends forth its tincture with our wa|ter. In this natural operation there is no need of calcination, &s;olution, reduction to its <HI>pri|ma materia:</HI> and &s;eparation of the foure ele|ments, which are the mo&s;t difficile operations in the compo&s;ition of the &s;tone. And where many may erre, for here as yet the matter is not coagulate, neither is mercurie vnited to its &s;alt and &s;ulfur: but nature finding the &s;alt, &s;ulphur, and mercurie of minerals, as yet not vnited, conjoyns them by dige&s;tion and cohobation, &s;ublimating and &s;ubtilizing the earthly part, re~dring the mercurial fixed, go|ing on naturally with all the operations re|qui&s;ite to the perfection of the work, as co|agulation, cibation, &s;ublimation, fermenta|tion, exaltation, augmentation, as certain|ly it would increa&s;e, grow, and fill up, the whole concavities where our water is con|tained, if there were not a continuall proje|ction of this naturall elixir, this <HI>magi&s;terium</HI> <PB REF="12">this quinte&s;&s;ence of all mettals, in our water di&s;&s;olving it &s;elf therein, the water being im|pregnate with this admirable yet naturall medicine, bur&s;ts out dauncing, bringing with it the cure of all di&s;ea&s;es, crying and calling all tho&s;e who are troubled and load|ned with infirmities, to come and buy with|out money what may re&s;tore them to their health. And truely I may &s;peak of this &s;ource what &s;weetly the prince of French Poets did &s;ing of the tree of life: neither let divins take exception that we &s;ymbolize from one earthly thing to another, from the tree of life to the water of life, for what is called the tree of life in the old te&s;tament is called the water of life in the new: both pointing out the lively vertue of our life which is hid in Chri&s;t: yet from the tree of life to the water of life let mee <HI>&s;ub&s;ultim</HI> pa&s;&s;e, as birds doe from &s;prayes to brayes and from mountains to fountaines, &s;aying of this water what hee &s;poke of that tree, <HI>Du Bartas.</HI> pag. 174.</P>

<HEAD>When the Petrean waters are to be taken.</HEAD>
<P>GEnerally all &s;ea&s;ons, when the weather is good, and the aire dry, and clear, are convenient to drink of this water, ab&s;taining when the air is ful of hanging clouds, threat+ning us with rain, or foggy mi&s;ts. In win|ter there is more &s;trength in our water then any other time, becau&s;e then the &s;ubterrane|an heat is greater, <HI>per antiperi&s;ta&s;in,</HI> &s;ending forth in greater abundance, the tinctures of what is there included.

Yet Hippo|crates doth not altogether forbid the u&s;e of medicine, about that time, but tells us only that it is difficult. The medicaments u&s;ed in his time, were Hellebore, without any good preparation, or &s;ome &s;uch other violent me|dicament, which we in this our age will u&s;e in no time of the year, without great and ex|qui&s;ite preparation. For if he had known the u&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia, manna, Rubarbe, &s;yrup ro|&s;at, &amp;c.</HI> he had never mentioned any danger in the canicular dayes. You mu&s;t al&s;o di&s;tin|gu&s;h the place, he lived in a hote countrey, we in a cold. The mo&s;t part of phy&s;icians affirme, that the &s;pring and automne are the mo&s;t proper times for medicine, becau&s;e then the aire is mo&s;t temperate, without pearcing cold, or &s;corching heat: we in Scot|land are troubled at no time with heat, the &s;ummer di&s;tingui&s;hed chiefly from the win|ter, by the longer &s;ojourning of the &s;un in <PB REF="18">our horizon, wherefore it is mo&s;t agreable with rea&s;on to take medicine in Scotland in our hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on.

<P>Live temperatly a long time after the drinking of the water in a clear, pure, whole&s;ome aire to breath on: eating meats of good dige&s;tion to &s;uffice nature, not gree|die appetit: &s;leeping to refre&s;h, not to dull your &s;pirits: waking to drive away &s;tupidi|tie, dulne&s;&s;e, and drow&s;inee&s;&s;e from your braines, not to wa&s;t, con&s;ume, and dry your bodies: u&s;ing exerci&s;e for recreation, not to weary: taking re&s;t for a remeed to your wea|rine&s;&s;e, re&s;toring &s;trength, that your bodies may be made more fit, to indure new travels and labours: avoyde repletion of the belly, inte&s;tins and veins, by moderate evacuation of nature, and if &s;low, make help by art: nei|ther <PB REF="20">violent, to re&s;olve your &s;pirits, or to evacuate with excrements your &s;ouls.

To which I pray GOD happily to bring us all, throgh IESUS CHRIST, Amen.</P>
