<P>_WHat I have certified you, is not onely confirmed, but we have likewi&s;e received here further intelligence, that the Swedes are already in the mid&s;t of our King|dom, and have anew totally routed and defeated the re&s;t of Gen: <HI>Marazini's</HI> forces, and about 1000 of them &s;lain, obtained 28 Standards, and taken pri&s;oner Gen: <HI>Marazini</HI> him&s;elf, together with his wife and children, the yong Count of Shlick, and other Officers, which cau&s;eth great fear, not onely in this City, but even at Vienna: Gen: <HI>Hatzfeld</HI> is comming with his troops, to &s;uccour Gen: <HI>Gallas,</HI> but the Swedi&s;h Gen: Major <HI>King</HI> followeth him upon the foot; if this conjunction be hindred, our Kingdom will be in the highe&s;t danger; and it is to be feared, that we &s;hall not be rid again &s;o &s;oon of the&s;e gue&s;ts: Gen: <HI>Gallas,</HI> Fieldmar&s;hall Baron of Hoffkirck, the old Count of Shlick, Count of Fur&s;tenburg, and Count of Colleredo, are here in this City very much perplex'd, and their forces intrench them&s;elves upon the White-Hill:</P>

<P>The Hatzfeldi&s;h troops, which are arrived hereabouts, and lye at Furt, are to break up again to morrow, or next day after, with whom certain Bavarian troops are to joyn, and go together into Bohemia, they have very bad weather to march, and are likely to come too late: At this in|&s;tant we receive the Letters from Prague, it &s;eemeth the poor people dare not write what they know, yet this they certifie, that the Swedes at their own plea&s;ure &s;traggle all the Country over, and play the ma&s;ter in the field; the Imperiali&s;ts, except the Hatzfeldi&s;h &s;uccour, which con|&s;i&s;ts of brave hor&s;men, but the foot are not 1500 &s;trong, and in all, both hor&s;e and foot, not above 5000; the Imperiali&s;ts them&s;elves begin al|ready to pillage in the Cities of Prague; the pa&s;&s;age towards Dre&s;den and Sile&s;ia is &s;topp'd, and it &s;eemeth that the War will be very hot this yeer in Bohemia and Sile&s;ia; if &s;o be that Gen: <HI>Bannier</HI> gives one blow more to the Imperiali&s;ts, he will go a great way: the Swedes go about to &s;alute the Hatzfeldi&s;h troops, afore they come into Bohemia; many
<PB REF="2" MS="y">of the &s;aid Hatzfeldi&s;h troops run away, in&s;omuch that not above 4000 men will come into Bohemia.</P>
