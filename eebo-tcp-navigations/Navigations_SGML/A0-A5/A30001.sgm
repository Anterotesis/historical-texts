<ITEM>Added TEMPHEAD, checked ID, and added TYPEs to DIVs in order to validate. Restructured as TEXT containing FRONT (title page, etc. of whole book) and GROUP (which contains all the individual items, most with their own title pages). First TEXT restructured so that parallel texts (English poetic treatise and a Latin translation thereof, unrecognized by vendor) occupy separate DIV1s which run continuously from beginning to end of the work. LGs removed from this first TEXT (only minimally indicated in book in any case) in order to avoid validation problems resulting from breaking apart supposed LGs tagged by vendor that ran across division between English and parallel Latin texts. Odd lists of books at end of each text tagged as back-matter DIV1s of TYPE="advertisement", and this seems to be their character and some of them are actually headed with this label. Licenses and following imprints on title pages tagged as DIV2s of TYPE license and imprint respectively (licenses had been tagged as line-groups!). Some epigraphs and quotations identified and tagged. Several HI and non-HI passages reversed, and several missing HI tags added, especially in heads. All title pages cursorily proofed. [JUDITH: Proofed title page(s). Checked for TYPE="book". Checked ^s. Reviewed structure. Checked division-marking material at heads and feet of divisions (HEADS, etc.). Checked for signatures. Checked placement and completeness of PBs. Checked for damage GAPs, #s, @s, --s, and UNCLEARs. Corrected 2 $s of 147. Converted 145 $s to GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc".  Checked for EPIGRAPHs and ARGUMENTs. Checked for startqs, endqs, oes, q;s, and Qs. Checked proofsheets and made corrections found there. Checked for CLOSERs, TRAILERs, and BYLINEs. DONE.]</ITEM>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Collecting into One Volume Several Choice Poems that were first Printed <HI>singly,</HI> met with so kind Reception as encourag'd the Publishing of the following Pieces <HI>together.</HI> Amongst the Former your celebrated <HI>Duel of the Stags</HI> made a Princi|pal Figure; as indeed it will always shine a fixed Star in the highest Orb of English Poetry. Great and Eminent as you are in other Stations, yet I hope, Sir, you will not disdain to be Register'd amongst the Sons of <HI>Apollo.</HI> The Off-springs of your Muse are so Beautiful, that <HI>Great Britain</HI> is proud of 'em; and if you are not equally pleas'd with 'em, 'tis the first Instance of your Indifference towards any thing that does Honour to your <HI>Country.</HI> She glories that your Genius has not been confin'd to any single Walk of Poetry, but travers'd all its Provinces, and (like <HI>Hercules</HI>) every where erected Pillars and Trophies, to be gaz'd upon with wonder by Posterity. Nature and Art are equal sharers in all you Write; and whatever the Subject has been, Invention, Spirit, Manly Sense and Iudgment are never wanting to adorn it. You are, Sir, deservedly Admir'd for the Ingenuity of your <HI>Own</HI> Works, and no less for your generous Candour to the Performances of <HI>Other</HI> Men. You are no rigid Censurer of
<PB REF="3"> their <HI>Faults,</HI> but their <HI>Excellencies</HI> never escape your Obser|vation. This is the Noblest Part of <HI>Criticism,</HI> as requiring not only a discerning Apprehension, but a Goodness of Temper which is not always found in Persons of Wit.</P>
<P>But, Sir, besides the Honour you have done the Muses in theiroown Faculty, you have further advanc'd their Reputation, by shewing the World, that a Poet can likewise be a States|man and <HI>Patriot</HI> of his Country. To your Knowledge in all the <HI>Liberal Sciences,</HI> you have acquir'd that Nobler Skill in the <HI>Constitution</HI> of our Government, and exerted it upon all Occasions in behalf of English <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property.</HI> You have not contented your self with the private Exer|cise of Iustice and Generosity, but have shewn a Publick Spirit, employing your great Sense and Sagacity in mat|ters of <HI>National</HI> Importance. What you have written with relation thereunto, and what has been spoken by you in Debates of Vastest Consequence, had no small Influence on the Sefflement of our State. These are inviting oc|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sions for P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egyrick, but above my small Capacity: Where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e I return to my first Design of presenting to you the following <HI>Collection</HI> of Poems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> amongst which I know but One that needs any Apology.

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO MY Lord Chamberlain.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHat? Shall the KING the Nations Genius raise,</L>
<L>And make us Rival our great <HI>Edward's</HI> Days;</L>
<L>Yet not one Muse, worthy a Conq'ror's Name,</L>
<L>Attend his Triumphs, and Record his Fame!</L>
<L>Oh, <HI>Dorset!</HI> You alone this Fault can mend,</L>
<L>The Muses Darling, Confident, and Friend?</L>
<L>The Poets are your Charge, and, if unfit,</L>
<L>You should be fin'd to furnish abler Wit;</L>
<L>Oblig'd to quit your Ease, and draw agen,</L>
<L>To paint the Greatest Heroe, the Best Pen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Heroe, who thus early does out-shine</L>
<L>The Ancient Honours of his Glorious Line;</L>
<L>And, soaring more sublimely to Renown,</L>
<L>The Mem'ry of their pious Triumphs drown:</L>
<L>Whose Actions are deliver'd o'er to Fame,</L>
<L>As Types, and Figures of His greater Name.</L>

<PB N="2" REF="23">
<L>When Fate some mighty Genius has design'd,</L>
<L>For the Relief, and Wonder of Mankind,</L>
<L>Nature takes Time to answer the Intent,</L>
<L>And climbs, by slow Degrees, the steep Ascent:</L>
<L>She toils, and labours with the growing Weight,</L>
<L>And watches carefully the Steps of Fate;</L>
<L>Till all the Seeds of Providence unite,</L>
<L>To set the Heroe in a happy Light;</L>
<L>Then, in a lucky and propitious Hour,</L>
<L>Exerts her Force, and calls forth all her Pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In <HI>Nassam's</HI> Race she made this long Essay;</L>
<L>Heroes and Patriots prepar'd the Way,</L>
<L>And promis'd, in their Dawn, this brighter Day:</L>
<L>A Publick Sp'rit distinguish'd all the Line;</L>
<L>Successive Vertues in each Branch did shine,</L>
<L>Till this last Glory rose, and Crown'd the Great Design.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest be his Name! and peaceful lie his Grave,</L>
<L>Who durst his Native Soil, lost <HI>Holland,</HI> save!</L>
<L>But <HI>William's</HI> Genius takes a wider Scope,</L>
<L>And gives the injur'd, in all Kingdoms, Hope:</L>
<L>Born to subdue insulting Tyrants Rage,</L>
<L>The Ornament, and Terrour, of the Age;</L>
<PB N="3" REF="23">
<L>The Refuge, where afflicted Nations find,</L>
<L>Relief from those, Oppressors of Mankind,</L>
<L>Whom Laws restrain not, and no Oaths can bind.</L>
<L>Him, their Deliv'rer <HI>Europe</HI> does confess,</L>
<L>All Tongues extol, and all Religions bless;</L>
<L>The <HI>Po,</HI> the <HI>Danube, Boetis,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI></L>
<L>United in his Praise, their Wonder join:</L>
<L>While, in the Publick Cause, he takes the Field,</L>
<L>And shelter'd Nations fight behind his Shield.</L>
<L>His Foes themselves dare not Applause refuse:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And shall such Actions want a faithful Muse?</L>
<L>Poets have this to boast; Without their Aid,</L>
<L>The freshest Lawrels, nipp'd by Malice, fade,</L>
<L>And Vertue to Oblivion is betray'd:</L>
<L>The proudest Honours have a narrow Date,</L>
<L>Unless they vindicate their Names from Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who is equal to sustain the Part!</L>
<L><HI>D&mdash;n</HI> has Numbers: But he wants a Heart;</L>
<L>Enjoyn'd a Penance (which is too severe</L>
<L>For playing once the Fool) to Persevere.</L>
<L>Others, who knew the Trade, have laid it down;</L>
<L>And, looking round, I find you stand alone.</L>
<PB N="4" REF="24">
<L>How, Sir! can you, or any <HI>English</HI> Muse,</L>
<L>Our Countrey's Fame, our Monarch's Arms, refuse?</L>

<LG>
<L>'Tis not my Want of Gratitude, but Skill,</L>
<L>Makes me decline what I can ne'er fulfill:</L>
<L>I cannot sing of Conquests, as I ought,</L>
<L>And my Breath fails to swell a lofty Note.</L>
<L>I know my Compass, and my Muse's Size,</L>
<L>She loves to Sport and Play, but dares not Rise;</L>
<L>Idly affects, in this Familiar Way,</L>
<L>In easie Numbers loosely to convey,</L>
<L>What Mutual Friendship wou'd at Distance say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poets assume another Tone and Voice,</L>
<L>When Victory's their Theam, and Arms their Choice.</L>
<L>To follow Heroes, in the Chace of Fame,</L>
<L>Asks Force, and Heat, and Fancy wing'd with Flame.</L>
<L>What VVords can paint the Royal VVarrior's Face?</L>
<L>What Colours can the Figure boldly raise?</L>
<L>When cover'd o'er with comely Dust and Smoke,</L>
<L>He pierc'd the Foe, and thickest Squadrons broke?</L>
<L>His bleeding Arm, still painful with the Sore,</L>
<L>Which, in his Peoples Cause, the Pious Father bore:</L>
<L>VVhom, cleaving through the Troops a Glorious VVay,</L>
<L>Not the united Force of <HI>France,</HI> and Hell, cou'd stay.</L>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO Monsieur Boileau.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TOO long, Great Man, thy Muse has try'd in vain,</L>
<L>Thy Monarch's sinking Credit to sustain;</L>
<L>And thou too long hast mis-employ'd thy Pen,</L>
<L>To make the <HI>worst</HI> appear the <HI>best</HI> of Men;</L>
<L>A sullied Fame to brighten and refine,</L>
<L>That never did with real Lustre shine.</L>
<L>While, as one, flatter'd by too fair a Glass,</L>
<L>Views but the wanted Beauties of his Face;</L>
<L>So <HI>Lewis,</HI> in thy lofty Praise does see</L>
<L>Not what he is, but what he wants to be.</L>
<L>And he must all his boasted Glories own,</L>
<L>Not from himself deriv'd, but thee alone;</L>
<L>Whose Muse so well does his mean Deeds reherse,</L>
<L>That he becomes Immortal in thy Verse;</L>
<L>But to thy Verse no lasting Fame can give,</L>
<L>In recompence for what he does receive.</L>
<L>Leave, leave him then to raise his own Renown,</L>
<L>And win the Laurels that his Temples crown:</L>
<L>A better Cause, and nobler Subject chuse,</L>
<L>That may inspire, as it employs, thy Muse;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="38">
<L>May with thy elevated Sense agree,</L>
<L>And copious as thy boundless Fancy be;</L>
<L>A Hero, whose bright Fame may gild thy Bays,</L>
<L>And more thy Name, than thou his Glory raise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See, see, his Conq'ring Sword great <HI>Nassaw</HI> draws;</L>
<L>Not poorly bribes, but merits thy Applause:</L>
<L>His brave Exploits afford thy Muse a Theme</L>
<L>Equal to that, as that is worthy them.</L>
<L>The Titles he, in Fame's Records does hold,</L>
<L>Are purchas'd by his Valour, not his Gold.</L>
<L>He owes his Glory to himself alone,</L>
<L>And Acquisition makes it all his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst <HI>Lewis</HI> rarely does in Arms appear,</L>
<L>Nor then to fight, but follow in the Rear:</L>
<L>Our <HI>Monarch</HI> charging in the Front we see;</L>
<L>None more expos'd, none less concern'd than he.</L>
<L>Who lets his Soldiers on no Dangers go,</L>
<L>But what, as he commands, he leads them to:</L>
<L>Thus, taught by his Example to obey,</L>
<L>They bravely follow, as he shews the Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so your King; he still declines the Fight,</L>
<L>Nor shuns the Danger only, but its Sight;</L>
<L>Yet with unmerited Success grown vain,</L>
<L>He boasts of Conquests he did never gain.</L>
<L>His Breaches were from Golden Batt'ries made,</L>
<L>And our lost Towns not taken, but betray'd.</L>
<L>Thus when some Place by Purchace is made sure,</L>
<L>His Person, and his Honour too, secure,</L>
<L>Then the triumphant Monarch takes the Field,</L>
<L>And gains the Town that waited so to yield.</L>
<PB N="5" REF="38">
<L>This makes him with affected Greatness swell,</L>
<L>And boast his Arms as irresistible;</L>
<L>His Arches are by such Atchievements rear'd:</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Lewis</HI> fights, and thus is to be fear'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But since he finds the Scene is alter'd now,</L>
<L>And that his Treasure, as his Courage, low,</L>
<L>Will not the old prevailing Means afford,</L>
<L>That more enlarg'd his Conquests, than his Sword,</L>
<L>He forms no hopeless Siege, makes no Campaigne,</L>
<L>From which he knows he shall no Honour gain:</L>
<L>But to the Field has wisely sent his Son,</L>
<L>To bear the blame of losing what he won;</L>
<L>For all the Conquest he this Year can boast,</L>
<L>Is that in Running his Success was most<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>While <HI>Huy's</HI> reduc'd to serve its Native Lord;</L>
<L>Not as 'twas lost, but storm'd with Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Sword;</L>
<L>Which proves as irresistible a Pow'r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></L>

<LG>
<L>Now the <HI>French</HI> Army, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vn we knew</L>

<L>So by Great <HI>William's</HI> conqu'ring Arms dismay'd,</L>
<L>The Gen'rals durst not venture to its Aid:</L>
<L>Happy they could their own Intrenchments keep,</L>
<L>Though dug, to suit their low-sunk Spirits, deep.</L>
<L>Yet scarce they lost their Appehension there,</L>
<L>Nor as from Danger, were secur'd from Fear.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="39">
<L>Till they, for greater Safety, left the Place</L>
<L>Not loaden now with Trophies, but Disgrace;</L>
<L>Such Conquests <HI>Lewis</HI> this Campaigne has won,</L>
<L>Such Triumphs Fate decreed his glorious Son.</L>
<L>But since no Honours from the barren Field</L>
<L>He reaps, what Laurels did the Ocean yield?</L>
<L>That sure his ruin'd Credit will repair,</L>
<L>And own his long-pretended Power there.</L>
<L>But as if both the Elements agreed</L>
<L>From his usurp'd Dominion to be freed,</L>
<L>The Sea no longer Tribute does afford,</L>
<L>But justly pays it to the ancient Lord.</L>
<L>Whose conqu'ring Fleets assert their native Right,</L>
<L>While the <HI>French</HI> Navy shuns the dreaded Sight.</L>
<L>And sees it self in its own Ports confin'd,</L>
<L>By Fear more pow'rful than an adverse Wind.</L>
<L>So when the scaly Sov'reign of the Seas,</L>
<L>Himself within his liquid Realm does please,</L>
<L>And with swift Finns ranges the briny Flood:</L>
<L>To take his Pastime there; or seek his Food.</L>
<L>His frightned Vassals hide their shining Heads,</L>
<L>In the kind Covert of concealing Weeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our floating Squadrons now their Right regain,</L>
<L>And unobstructed wanton through the Main,</L>
<L>Insult the <HI>Gallick</HI> Coasts, and their just Rage</L>
<L>With Sacrifice of flaming Towns asswage:</L>
<L>Whose sable Smoak ascending to the Sky,</L>
<L>Mourns for the Structures that in Ashes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly.</L>
<L>While strange Confusion spread along the Shore,</L>
<L>Makes <HI>England's</HI> Pow'r rever'd as heretofore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="39">
<L>Nor does one Fleet alone her Fame advance,</L>
<L>The Joys in <HI>Spain</HI> equal the Fears in <HI>France.</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Barcellona</HI> all Attempts defies,</L>
<L>While on our <HI>Monarch's</HI> Succour she relies,</L>

<L>She triumphs in the sure Defence it brings.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Spain</HI> by our <HI>Elisa</HI> shook before,</L>

<L>Then in his Praises let fam'd <HI>Boileau</HI> join,</L>
<L>And to his Side, like Victory, incline:</L>

<L>But if thou wilt a servile Labour chuse,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Arbitrary Pow'r</HI> enslaves thy Muse;</L>
<L>And does thy Thoughts to narrow Bounds confine,</L>
<L>Which Heav'n for boundless Subjects did design:</L>
<L>Know, our fam'd Prince can his own Trophies raise,</L>
<L>And courts as little as he wants thy Praise.</L>
<L>Nor, if such Means his Glory could advance,</L>
<L>Wou'd he have need to be oblig'd to <HI>France:</HI></L>
<L>Since his own Realms abound with Men of Sence,</L>
<L>And famous for Poetick Excellence.</L>
<L>Whose lofty Verse your humble Strain exceeds,</L>
<L>As much as his your meaner Patron's Deeds.</L>
<L>Witness the Muse that first in Songs Divine,</L>
<L>Describ'd his Fight and Conquest at the <HI>Boyne.</HI></L>
<L>That which most pleas'd, was difficult to tell,</L>
<L>The Field so bravely won, or sung so well.</L>
<L>Witness that happy Pen that did relate</L>
<L>His glorious Voyage to the <HI>Belgick</HI> State;</L>
<PB N="8" REF="40">
<L>And gave the World a Proof with how much Fire</L>
<L>Our Poets write when them our Kings inspire.</L>
<L>But our Great Monarch's Praises shou'd no more,</L>
<L>Than his large Soul be bounded by our Shore;</L>
<L>Far as his Victories, his spreading Fame shou'd sound,</L>
<L>And be in every Tongue, as every Land renown'd;</L>
<L>Then, <HI>Boileau,</HI> let thy Muse begin her lofty Flight,</L>
