<HEAD><HI>The Preface.</HI> Heere beginneth a little treati&s;e or booke named <HI>Iohn Maundeuile</HI> Knight, borne in England in the Towne of S. <HI>Albone,</HI> and &s;peaketh of the wayes to Hieru&s;alem, to Inde, and to the great Caane, and al&s;o to <HI>Pre&s;tor Iohns</HI> land, and to many other countries, and al&s;o of many meruailes that are in the holy land.</HEAD>
<P>_FOra&s;much as the land ouer the Sea, that is to &s;ay, the holie land, that &s;ome call the land of Bihe&s;t, among all other lands is mo&s;t worthie and &s;oueraigne, for it is ble&s;&s;ed, hallowed and &s;acred of the precious bloud of our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, in the which land it liked him to take fle&s;h and bloud of the Virgin Marie, and to enuiron that land with his owne feete, and there he would do many mira|cles, preach and teach the faith and the law of chri|&s;tian men, as vnto his children, and there he would &s;uffer manie reproues and &s;cornes for vs, and hee that was king of heauen and hell, of earth, of aire, of &s;ea, and land, and of all things that are contained in them, would alonely be called king of that land, when hee &s;aid, <HI>Rex &s;um Iudaeorum,</HI> I am King of the Iewes: For at that time it was the land of Iewes, and that land he cho&s;e before all other lands, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t worthie of vertues of all the world. And as the Philo&s;opher &s;aith: <HI>Virtus rerum in medio con&s;i&s;tit,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the vertue of things is in the mid&s;t: and in that land hee would lead his life, and
<PB REF="3"> &s;uffer pa&s;&s;ion and death of the Iewes for vs, to &s;aue and deliuer vs from the paines of hell, and from death without end, the which was ordained to vs for the &s;inne of our father <HI>Adam,</HI> and our owne &s;ins al&s;o: for as for him&s;elfe he had none euill done nor de&s;erued, for he neuer thought ne did any euill, for he that was king of glory and of ioy might be&s;t in that place &s;uffer death. For hee that will doe any thing that he will haue knowne openly, he will pro|claime it openly, in the middle place of a towne or of a Citie, &s;o that it may be knowne to all par|ties of the citie. So he that was king of glorie and of all the world would &s;uffer death for vs at Hieru|&s;alem, which is the mid&s;t of the world, &s;o that it might be knowne to all nations of the world, how deare he bought man, that hee made him with his hands to his owne likene&s;&s;e, for the great loue that he had to vs: Ah deare God, what loue hee had to his &s;ubiects, when hee that had done no tre&s;pa&s;&s;e would for his tre&s;pa&s;&s;ours &s;uffer death: for a more worthie cattel he might not haue &s;et for vs, then his owne ble&s;&s;ed body, and his owne precious bloud the which he &s;uffered for vs, right well ought men to loue, wor&s;hip, dread and &s;erue &s;uch a Lord, &amp; prai&s;e &s;uch an holy land that brought forth a Lord of &s;uch fruite, through the which each man is &s;aued, but if it be his owne default. This is that land prepared for an heritage to vs, and in that land would he die as &s;ea&s;ed, to leaue it to his children. For the which each good chri&s;tian man that may and hath where|with, &s;hould &s;trength him for to conquere our right heritage &amp; purcha&s;e, out of the euill peoples hands,
<PB REF="3"> for we are cleped chri&s;tian men of Chri&s;t our father, and if we be the right children of Chri&s;t we ought to challenge the heritage that our father left vs, &amp; take it out of &s;trange mens hands. But now Pride, Coueti&s;e, and Enuie, hath &s;o inflamed the hearts of the Lords of the world, that they are more bu&s;ie to di&s;herite their neighbours, then to challenge or con|quere their right heritage afore&s;aid. And the com|mon people that would put their bodies and their cattell for to conquere our heritage, they may not do it without lords: for a&s;&s;embling of the people with|out a chiefe Lord, is as a flock of &s;heepe without a &s;hepheard, the which depart a&s;under, and wot not whither they &s;hall go. But would God the worldly Lords were at a good accord, &amp; with other of their common people, would take this holy voyage ouer the &s;ea, I tru&s;t well that within a little time our right heritage before &s;aid, &s;hould be reconciled and put into the hands of the right heirs of Ie&s;u Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as it is long time that there was any generall pa&s;&s;age ouer the &s;ea, &amp; that many men de&s;ire to heare &s;peaking of the holy land, and haue thereof great &s;olace and comfort.</P>
<P>Wherefore yee &s;hall heare by me <HI>Iohn Maunde|uile</HI> Knight, which was borne in England, in the towne of Saint Albones, and pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in the yeare of our Lord Ie&s;u Chri&s;t, a thou&s;and iii. C. on the day of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> and there remained long time, and went through many lands, &amp; many pro|uinces, kingdomes &amp; Iles, and haue pa&s;&s;ed through Turky, and through Armony, the little &amp; the great, through Tartary, Per&s;ia, Surry, Araby, Egypt
<PB REF="4"> the high and the low, through Libia, Chalde, and a great part of Ethiope, through Amazony, through Inde the le&s;&s;e &amp; the more, a great part, and through many other Iles which are about Inde, where ma|ny people dwelleth of diuers lawes and &s;hapes. Of the men of which lands &amp; Iles I &s;hall &s;peake more plainly: and I &s;hall declare part of the things what they are when time &s;hall be, after it may be&s;t come to my minde, and &s;pecially for them that will and are in purpo&s;e for to vi&s;ite the holy citie of Hieru&s;a|lem, and the holy places that are thereabout, and I &s;hall tell the way that they &s;hall hold thether; for I haue many times pa&s;&s;ed and ridden it with good company, and with many Lords.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, if a man come from the We&s;t &s;ide of the world, as England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and Norway, he may if h&eacute;e will goe through Almaine and throughout the kingdome of Hungary, which King is a great lord and a mightie, and hold|eth many lands and great, for he holdeth the land of Hungary, Sauoy, Camony, a great part of Bulgary, that men call the land of Bugres, and a great part of the kingdome of Ru&s;&s;ie, and that la&s;teth to the land of Milland, and marcheth on Ci|prus, and men pa&s;&s;e thus through the land of Hungary, and through the Citie that men call Cipanum, and through the ca|&s;tle of Nurburgh, &amp; by the Ile Torne, toward the end of Hun|gary, and &s;o by the riuer of Danubie, that is a full great riuer and goeth into Almaine, vnder the hils of Lumbardy, &amp; it ta|keth into it fortie other riuers, and it runneth throughout Hungary, and through Cre&s;&s;es and Crochie, and goeth into the &s;ea, &s;o &s;trongly and with &s;o great might that the water is fre&s;h thirty miles within the &s;ea, &amp; afterward men goe to Belgraue and entreth into the land of Bugres, and there men pa&s;&s;e a bridge of &s;tone that is ouer the riuer of Morack, &amp; &s;o men pa&s;&s;e through the land of Pin&s;eras and come to Gr&eacute;ece to the citie of Stermi&s;&s;e, and to the citie of Affinpane, that was &s;ometime called Bradre the noble, and &s;o the citie of Con&s;tantinople that was &s;ometime called Be&s;&s;alneron, and there dwelled common|ly the Emperour of Gr&eacute;ece.</P>

<P>At Con&s;tantinople is the be&s;t and the fayre&s;t Church of the world, and it is of Saint <HI>Steuen.</HI> And before this Church is a guilt Image of <HI>Iu&s;tinian</HI> the Emperour and it is &s;itting vpon a hor&s;e and crowned, and it was wont to holde a round apple in his hand, and men &s;ay there, that it is a token that the Em|perour hath lo&s;t a part of his lands, for the apple is fallen out of the Images hand: and al&s;o h&eacute;e hath lo&s;t a great part of his Lord&s;hip For h&eacute;e was wont to b&eacute;e Emperour of Roome, of Gr&eacute;ece, and of all A&s;ia the le&s;&s;e, of Surry, and of the land of Iudea, in the which is Hieru&s;alem, and of the land of Aegipt, of Percia and Arabia, but he hath lo&s;t all but Gr&eacute;ece, and that land he holdeth onely, men would put the apple in the Images hand, but it will not hold it. This apple betokeneth the Lord|&s;hip that he had ouer all the world, and the other hand he lift|eth vp again&s;t the Ea&s;t, in token to mena&s;&s;e mi&s;doers.

<P>For the p&eacute;ece that went right vp from the earth vnto the head was of Cipres, and the p&eacute;ece that went ouerthwart to the which his hands were nailed, was of Palme, &amp; the &s;tock that &s;tood within the earth in the which they had made a morteys, was of Ceder, and the table aboue his head was a foote and a halfe long, on which the title was written, that was of Oliue, the Iewes made this cro&s;&s;e of the&s;e foure manner of tr&eacute;es, for they thought that our Lord &s;hould haue hanged as long as the cro&s;&s;e might la&s;t, therfore made they the foot of Ceder, for Ceder may not in the earth ne in water rot, they thought that the bo|dy of Chri&s;t &s;hold haue &s;toncken, they made the p&eacute;ece that went from the earth vpward of Cipres, &s;o that the &s;mell of his body &s;hould grieue no man that came by, and that ouerthwart was made of Palme, in &s;ignification of victorie. And the table of the title was made of Oliue, for it betokeneth peace, as the &s;tory of <HI>Noe</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, when the Doue brought the branch of Oliue, that betokened peace made betw&eacute;ene God and man.</P>
<P>And al&s;o you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that the Chri&s;tian men that dwell ouer the Sea, &s;ay that the p&eacute;ece of the cro&s;&s;e that we call Cipres, was of the tr&eacute;e that <HI>Adam</HI> eate the apple off, and &s;o they finde written, and they &s;ay al&s;o that their Scripture &s;aith, that when <HI>Adam</HI> was &s;ick he &s;aid to his &s;on <HI>Seth,</HI> that h&eacute;e &s;hould go to Paradi&s;e, and pray the Angel that k&eacute;epeth Paradi&s;e that he would &s;end him oyle of the tr&eacute;e of mercy, for to annoynt him that h&eacute;e might haue health, &amp; <HI>Seth</HI> went, but the Angell would not let him come in at the gate, but &s;aid vnto him, that he might not haue of the oyle of mercy, but he tooke him thr&eacute;e carnels of the &s;ame tr&eacute;e that his father eate the apple off, and bad him as &s;oone as his father was dead, that h&eacute;e &s;hould put the&s;e carnels vnder his tongue &amp; burie him, and he did &s;o, and of the&s;e thr&eacute;e carnels &s;prang a tr&eacute;e as the Angel &s;aid, and when the tr&eacute;e bare fruit, then &s;hould <HI>Adam</HI> be made whole. And when <HI>Seth</HI> came againe and found his father dead, h&eacute;e did with the carnels as the Angell commaunded him, of the which came thr&eacute;e tr&eacute;es, whereof a Cro&s;&s;e was made that bare good fruit, that is to &s;ay, our Sauiour Ie&s;u Chri&s;t, through whom <HI>Adam</HI> and all that came of him &s;hould be &s;aued &amp; deliuered from euerla&s;ting death,

<P>A part of the crowne of our Lord Ie&s;u Chri&s;t wherwith he was crowned &amp; one of the nailes, &amp; the &s;peare head, and many other reliques are in Fraunce at Paris in the chappell of the kings, and the crowne lyeth in a ve&s;&s;el of cri&s;tall wel dight and richly, for the French king bought the&s;e reliques &s;ometime of the Iewes, to whom the Emperor had laid them to pledge for a great &s;um of gold. And although men &s;ay that this Crowne was of thornes, ye &s;hall vnder&s;tand that it was of Ioukes of the &s;ea, which be white and pricketh as &s;harp as thornes, for
<PB REF="7"> I haue &s;&eacute;ene and beheld many times that at Paris, and that at Con&s;tantinople, for they were both of one, &amp; made of Ioukes of the Sea. But men haue departed it in two parts, of the which one part is at Paris, and the other part at Con&s;tanti|nople, and I haue a point thereof that &s;&eacute;emeth a white thorne, and that was giuen me for a great friend&s;hip: For there are many of them broken &amp; fallen into the ve&s;&s;ell, when they &s;hew the crowne to great men or Lords that come thether. And y&eacute;e &s;hall vnder&s;tand that our Lord in that night that h&eacute;e was ta|ken, h&eacute;e was lead into a Garden, and there h&eacute;e was examined &s;harply, and there the Iewes crowned him with a Crowne of Abbe&s;pine branches that grew in the &s;ame Garden, and &s;et it on his head &s;o fa&s;t, that the bloud ranne downe by many pla|ces of his vi&s;age, necke and &s;houlders, and therefore hath the Abbe&s;pine many vertues, for h&eacute;e that beareth a braunch of it a|bout him, no thunder, nor no manner of tempe&s;t may hurt him, nor the hou&s;e that it is in may no euill gho&s;t come, nor in no place where it is. And in that &s;ame garden &s;aint <HI>Peter</HI> denyed our Lord thrice, and afterward was our Lord lead before the Bi&s;hop &amp; Mini&s;ters of the Law into another garden of <HI>Anne,</HI> and there h&eacute;e was examined, &s;courged, and crowned oft with a &s;w&eacute;e Thorne, that men call Harbareus that grew in the &s;ame Garden, and that hath many vertues. And afterward he was lead to a garden of <HI>Caiaphas</HI> and there he was crowned againe with Eglentine, &amp; after that h&eacute;e was lead to a chamber of <HI>Pi|late</HI> and there h&eacute;e was crowned, and the Iewes &s;et him in a chayre, and clad him in a mantell of purple. And then made they a crowne of Ioukes of the &s;ea, and there they kn&eacute;eled to him &amp; &s;corned him &s;aying. <HI>Aue rex Iudeorum.</HI> That is to &s;ay, haile king of Iewes. And of this crowne, halfe is at Paris, and the other halfe at Con&s;tantinople, the which our &s;auiour Ie&s;us Chri&s;t had on his head, when h&eacute;e was nailed on the cro&s;&s;e. And the &s;peares &s;haft hath the Emperour of Almaine, but the head which was put in his &s;ide is at Paris, they &s;ay, in the holy chap|pell: and oft times &s;aith the Emperour of Con&s;tantinople, that he hath the &s;peares head, &amp; I haue &s;&eacute;ene it, but it is greater then that at Paris. Al&s;o at Con&s;tantinople lyeth &s;aint <HI>Anne</HI> our la|dies
<PB REF="7"> mother, whom &s;aint <HI>Elene</HI> cau&s;ed to b&eacute;e brought from Ie|ru&s;alem, and ther lieth al&s;o the body of &s;aint <HI>Iohn Chri&s;o&s;tome</HI> that was Bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople. There lyeth al&s;o Saint <HI>Luke</HI> the Euangeli&s;t, for his bones were brought from Betha|ny where he was buryed: and many other reliquies are there, and ther is of the ve&s;&s;el of &s;tone, as it were marble, which men call Hidrius, that euermore droppeth water, &amp; filleth him&s;elfe euery yeare once. And y&eacute;e &s;hall wit that Con&s;tantinople is a fayre citty and well walled, and it is thr&eacute;e cornered, and there is an arme of the &s;ea that men call Helle&s;pon, &amp; &s;ome men call it the bunch of Con&s;tantinople, and &s;ome men call it the brach of &s;aint <HI>George:</HI> and this water enclo&s;eth two parts of the ci|tie, &amp; vpward to the &s;ea vpon that water, was wont to b&eacute;e the great citie of Troy in a faire plaine, but that citie was de&s;troi|ed by the Gr&eacute;ekes.</P>

<P>_ABout Gr&eacute;ece be many Iles that men cal Cala&s;tre, Calcas, Settico, Thoy&s;oria, Minona, Faxton, Mo|lo, Carpate, and Lempne. And in this Ile is mount Athoes that pa&s;&s;eth the clouds, and there are di|uers &s;peaches &amp; many countries that are obedient to the Em|perour of Con&s;tantinople, that is to &s;ay, Turcoply, Pincy,
<PB REF="8"> Narde, Comage, and many other, Thracy and Macedonie, of which <HI>Alexander</HI> was King. In this countrie was <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> borne, in a Citty that men cal Strageris, a little from the citty of Tragie, and at Strageris is <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> buried, and there is an Alter on his tombe, and there make they a great fea&s;t euery yeare as he were a Saint, and vpon his alter the Lords hold their great coun&s;ailes &amp; a&s;&s;embles, &amp; they thinck that through the in&s;piration of God and him, they &s;hould haue the better coun&s;ell. In this Countrie are right high hils, there is an hill that men call Olimphus, that parteth Macedonie and Thra|cia, and is as high as the cloudes, and the other hill that men call Athoes is &s;o high, that the &s;hadow of him &s;tretcheth vnto Olimphus, and it is n&eacute;ere lxxvij. mile betw&eacute;ene, and aboue that hill is the ayre &s;o cl&eacute;ere that men may f&eacute;ele no winde there, and therefore may no bea&s;t liue there the ayre is &s;o dry, and men &s;ay in the country that Philo&s;ophers &s;omtime went vp to the&s;e &s;ame hils and held to their no&s;es a &s;pounge wet with water for to haue ayre, for the ayre was &s;o dry there, and aboue in the pouder of the hill they wrote letters with their fingers, and at the yeares end they came againe and found tho&s;e letters which they had written the y&eacute;ere before without any default, &amp; there|fore it &s;&eacute;emeth well that the&s;e hils pa&s;&s;e the cloudes to the pure ayre. At Con&s;tantinople is the Emperours Pallaice which is faire and well dight, and therein is a place for iu&s;ting, and it is made about with &s;tages that each man may well &s;&eacute;e &amp; none grieue other, and vnder the&s;e &s;tages are &s;tables vauted for the Emperours hor&s;es, &amp; all the pillers of the&s;e &s;tables are of mar|ble. And within the Church of &s;aint <HI>Sophie,</HI> an Emperor would haue laid the body of his Father when h&eacute;e was dead, and as they made the graue they found a body in the earth, and vpon the body lay a great plate of fine gold, and thervpon was writ|ten in Ebrew, Gr&eacute;eke and Latin letters, that &s;aid thus. <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;tus na&s;cetur de virgine Maria, &amp; ego credo in eum:</HI> That is to &s;ay, Ie&s;u Chri&s;t &s;hall be borne of the virgin <HI>Marie</HI> and I bel&eacute;eue in him. And the date was that it lay in the earth two hundreth y&eacute;ere b&eacute;efore our Lord Ie&s;u Chri&s;t was borne, and yet is that plate in the trea&s;urie of the Church, &amp; men &s;ay that
<PB REF="8"> it was <HI>Hermogenes</HI> the wi&s;e man And neuerthele&s;&s;e, if it be &s;o men of that Gr&eacute;ece b&eacute;e Chri&s;tians, yet they vary from our faith, for they &s;ay that the holy Gho&s;t commeth not out of the &s;on, but all onelie of the father, and they are not obedient to the Church of Roome, nor to the Pope, &amp; they &s;ay, that their Pa|triarks haue as much power ouer the &s;ea, as the Pope hath on this &s;ide the &s;ea. And therefore Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> the xxij. &s;ent letters to them, how Chri&s;tian men &s;hould b&eacute;e all one, and that they &s;hould be obedient to a Pope that is Chri&s;ts Vicar on earth, to whom God gaue plaine power to binde and to a&s;&s;oyle, and therefore they &s;hould be obedient to him.

In the Church of the Sepulcher was wont to b&eacute;e Cannons of &s;aint <HI>Benet,</HI> and they had a Priourie, and the Patriarke was their Soueraigne: and without the doores of the Church on the right &s;ide as men goe vp xviii. &s;teps, our Lord &s;aid to his mother, <HI>Mulier, Ecce filius tuus.</HI> That is to &s;ay: Woman behold thy Sonne. <HI>Deinde dixit di&s;|cipulo.

And the&s;e words h&eacute;e &s;aid when h&eacute;e hanged vpon the Cro&s;&s;e, and vpon the &s;teps went our Lord when h&eacute;e bare the Cro&s;&s;e vpon his &s;houlder, and vnder the&s;e &s;taires is a Chappell where the Prie&s;ts &s;ing.

<P>In this vale of <HI>Io&s;ophat</HI> without the Cittie is the Church of Saint <HI>Stephen</HI> where he was &s;toned to death, and thereby is the gate builded that may not b&eacute;e opened.

<P>_AND y&eacute;e &s;hall vnder&s;tand that this is not the tem|ple that <HI>Salomon</HI> made, for that temple la&s;ted but a thou&s;and an hundred and two y&eacute;ere. For <HI>Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ianus</HI> &s;onne, that was Emperour of Rome that layd &s;iege about Hieru&s;alem, for to di&s;comfite the Iewes, for that they had put Chri&s;t to death without leaue of the Em|perour, when h&eacute;e had taken the Cittie, h&eacute;e did burne the Tem|ple, and ca&s;t it downe, and tooke all the Iewes, and put to death eleuen hundred thou&s;and and the other h&eacute;e put in pri&s;on, &amp; &s;old xxx. for a pennie, for h&eacute;e &s;aid that they bought Ie&s;us Chri&s;t for xxx. pence. And &s;ince gaue <HI>Iulian Apo&s;tatate</HI> leaue to the Iewes to make the Temple of Hieru&s;alem againe, for h&eacute;e hated Chri|&s;tians, &amp; yet h&eacute;e was a Chri&s;tian, but h&eacute;e for&s;ooke his law. And when the Iewes had builded againe the Temple then came
<PB REF="22"> an earthquake (as God would) &amp; ca&s;t downe all that they had made. Since that <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperour who was of them of Troy made Hieru&s;alem againe, and the Temple in that &s;ame manner that <HI>Salomon</HI> made it, and commanded that no Iewe &s;hould dwell there but Chri&s;tians, and although h&eacute;e him&s;elfe was not a Chri&s;tian, yet h&eacute;e loued the Chri&s;tians more then other men, &s;aue men of his owne faith. And this Emperour did inclo&s;e and wall the Church of the holy Sepulcher within the cittie, that before was far without the cittie, and h&eacute;e would haue changed the name of Hieru&s;alem and called it Heliam, but that name la&s;ted not long. And y&eacute;e &s;hall vnder&s;tand that the Sara&s;ins doe great wor&s;hip in that Temple, and they &s;ay that place is right holy, and when they goe therein they goe bare foote and kn&eacute;ele many times downe. And when I and my fellowes came therein, w&eacute;e put off our harnei&s;e, and came bare foote into the Temple, and thought that w&eacute;e ought to do as much or more then they that were Infidels. And this Tem|ple is thr&eacute;e&s;core and thr&eacute;e cubites in widene&s;&s;e, and as much in length, and thirtie two cubites in height, and couered with lead, and it is within full of pillers of marble. And in the mid&s;t of the Temple is an alter of twentie and foure &s;teps of height, and good pillers all about. This place the Iewes called <HI>San|cta &s;anctorum.</HI> That is to &s;ay, holy of holie&s;t, and in that place commeth none but their prelate that maketh their &s;acrifice, and the people &s;tand all about in diuers Seates, as they are of dignitie and wor&s;hip: and there b&eacute;e foure enterings into the Temple, and the doores are of Cipres well dight, and within the Ea&s;t doore our Lord &s;aid, here is Hieru&s;alem. And on the North &s;ide within the doore is a fountaine but it runneth not: of the which holy writ &s;peaketh and &s;aith, <HI>Vidi aquam egredi|entem de templo.</HI> That is to &s;ay, I &s;aw water comming out of the Temple. And vpon the other &s;ide is a rock that men cal|led &s;ome time Moryach (but after it was called Belet) and the arke of God, with the reliques of the Iewes. This arke did <HI>Titus</HI> carry with him to Roome, when h&eacute;e had di&s;comfited all the Iewes. In that &s;ame arke were the ten commandements, and <HI>Aarons</HI> rod, and <HI>Moy&s;es</HI> rod, with which h&eacute;e parted the
<PB REF="23"> red &s;ea, when the people of I&s;raell pa&s;&s;ed through on dry foote, and with that rod h&eacute;e did many wonders, and there was the ve&s;&s;ell of gold full of manna, and clothing and ornaments, and the tabernacle of <HI>Aaron,</HI> &amp; a table &s;quare of Gold with twelue precious &s;tones, and a boxe of Ia&s;pes grauen with foure fin|gers, and eight names of our Lord within, and &s;euen candle|&s;tickes of Gold, and foure cen&s;ers of Gold, and an aulter al&s;o of fine gold, and foure Lyons of gold, vpon the which they had a Cherubin of Gold twelue &s;pans long, and a Tabernacle of Gold, and al&s;o xij. trumpets of &s;iluer, and a table of &s;iluer, and &s;eauen Barly loaues, and all other reliques that were before the natiuitie of Ie&s;u.

<P>And in that &s;ame place <HI>Dauid</HI> &s;aw the Angell that &s;lew the people with a &s;word, and put it all bloody in the &s;heth. And in this rock was Saint <HI>Simeon</HI> when h&eacute;e receiued our Lord into the Temple, and on this rock he &s;et him when the Iewes would haue &s;toned him, and the rock rent in two, and in that re&s;te h&eacute;e hid him, and after came downe and gaue him light.</P>
<P>And on this rock &s;ate our Lady and learned her P&s;alter. And there forgaue our Lord the &s;innes to the woman that was taken and found in Adultery, and there was our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t circumci&s;ed, and there the Angell denounced to <HI>Zachary</HI> the Natiuitie of Saint <HI>Iohn Bapti&s;t,</HI> and there offe|red fir&s;t <HI>Melchi&s;edech</HI> bread and wine &amp; water to our Lord, in token of the Sacrament that was to come, and there fell <HI>Dauid</HI> praying to our Lord for mercy, for him and for his peo|ple, when h&eacute;e &s;aw the Angell &s;lay his people, and our Lord a|none heard his prayer, and therefore would h&eacute;e make the tem|ple in that place, but our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t forbad him by an Angel, for he had committed murther in con&s;enting to the &s;lay|ing of the good knight <HI>Vrias,</HI> for to haue his wife. And therfore all that he had ordained for to make the Temple, h&eacute;e betooke it to <HI>Salomon</HI> his &s;onne, and he made it, and he prayed our Lord
<PB REF="23"> that all tho&s;e that prayed in that place deuoutly and with good heart, that he would heare their prayer, and graunt that they a&s;ked right wi&s;ely, and our Lord graunted it, and therfore <HI>Salomons</HI> &s;onne called it the Temple of coun&s;ell and help of God.</P>
<P>Without the doores of that Temple is an aulter where Iewes were wont to offer Doues and Turtilles, and in that Temple was <HI>Zachery</HI> &s;laine, and on the pinacle the Iewes &s;et Saint <HI>Iames</HI> that was the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of Hieru&s;alem. And a little from this Temple on the right &s;ide is a church couered with Lead, that is called the &s;choole of <HI>Salomon.</HI> And toward the South is the Temple of <HI>Salon</HI> that is a full fayre and a great place, and in this place dwell Knights, who are called Templers, and they were the founders thereof and of their or|der, and in that <HI>Templum Domini</HI> dwelled Chanons.</P>
<P>From this Temple toward the Ea&s;t xxvi. paces in a corner of the Cittie, is the Bathe of our Lord, and this Bathe was wont to goe to Paradi&s;e, and be&s;ide is our Ladyes bed, and n&eacute;ere there by is the Tombe of &s;aint <HI>Simeon.</HI> And without the Cloy&s;ter of the Temple toward the North is a right fayre Church of Saint <HI>Anne</HI> our Ladies mother, and there was our Lady conceiued, and before that Church is a great tr&eacute;e, which began to grow that &s;ame night. And as men go downe from the Church xxij. &s;teps, lyeth <HI>Ioachim</HI> our Ladyes Fa|ther in a Tombe of &s;tone, and there n&eacute;ere was layd &s;ometime Saint <HI>Anne,</HI> but Saint <HI>Eline</HI> did tran&s;late her to Con&s;tanti|nople. In this Church is a well in manner of a ce&s;terne, that is called <HI>(Probatica pi&s;cina)</HI> that hath fiue entrings, and in that ce&s;terne was wont an Angell to de&s;cend and &s;tir the wa|ter, and what man that bathed him fir&s;t therein after the &s;tir|ring, was made whole that was &s;icke, what &s;ickne&s;&s;e &s;o euer h&eacute;e had: and there was the man of the Pal&s;ie made whole, that was &s;icke xxxviii. y&eacute;ere, and our Lord &s;ayd to him in this manner of wi&s;e <HI>(Tolle grabatum tuum et ambula)</HI> That is to &s;ay, take vp thy bed and walke.

Tartary is a full euill land, &s;andy and a little fruit bearing, for there groweth but little corne or fruite, but Bea&s;tes are there great plentie, and therefore eate they fle&s;h without bread, and they &s;up the broth, and they drinck milcke of all manner of Bea&s;ts, they eate cats and all manner of wild bea&s;ts, as rats &amp; mice, and they haue little wood, and therefore they dre&s;&s;e their meat with hor&s;e doung, and other bea&s;t doung when it is dry. Princes and other Lords eate but once in the day, and that is very little, and they b&eacute;e foule folke, and of euill liking, and in Summer there is many tempe&s;ts and thunders that &s;layeth many men and bea&s;ts, &s;odainly it is right cold, and againe on the &s;odaine it is right hot. The Prince that gouer|neth that land they call <HI>Roco,</HI> and h&eacute;e dwelleth at a cittie that men call Orda, but very few men doe de&s;ire to dwell in that Land, for it is good to &s;ow thornes and w&eacute;edes in, but other good there is none, as I heard &s;ay, for I was not that way, but I haue b&eacute;ene in other Countries marching thereon as in the land of Ro&s;&s;ie and Ni&s;land, and the kingdome of Grecon, and Lectow, and the kingdome of Gra&s;ten, and in many other places, but I went neuer that way to Hieru&s;alem, and there|fore I cannot well tell it, for I haue vnder&s;tood that men may

<P>And if by chance any Chri&s;tians pa&s;&s;e that way as once a y&eacute;ere they doe, they carry their vittaile with them, for they &s;hould finde nothing there but a manner of thing that they call Syles, and they carry their vittailes vpon the I&s;e on &s;leds, and chariots without wh&eacute;eles, and as long as their vittailes la&s;t they may dwell there but no longer. And when the &s;pies of the countries &s;&eacute;e Chri&s;tians come, they runne to the townes and ca&s;tles, and cry aloud, kara, kara, kara, and as &s;oone as they haue cryed, then doth the people arme them.

In the land of Iude are more then fiue thou|&s;and Iles that are inhabited (be&s;ide diuers that are vninhabi|ted) and in each one of tho&s;e is great plentie of Citties, and much people: for men of Inde are of that condition that com|monly they pa&s;&s;e not out of their land, for they dwell vnder the Planet <HI>Saturne,</HI> and that Planet maketh his cour&s;e by the xij.

Signes in a Moneth, and for that <HI>Saturne</HI> is of &s;o little &s;tirring, therefore men that dwell vnder it, and in that Climate haue no good will to &s;tir much abroad. But in our countrie it is con|trary, for w&eacute;e are in a Climate that is of the Moone, and of light &s;tirring, and that is the Planets of way, and therefore it giueth vs will to much moouing and &s;tirring, and to goe into diuers Countries of the world, for it goeth about the world more lightly then any other Planet doth. Al&s;o men pa&s;&s;e through Inde to many countries by &s;ea. And then they come to the Ile of Hermes, where Marchaunts of Venice and of Gene and of other diuers parts of Chri&s;tendome come to buy their marchandi&s;e, but it is &s;o warme there in that Ile that mens members hang downe to their &s;hanks for the great di&s;|&s;oluing of the body.

Now &s;hall I tell of &s;ome lands, countries and Iles that are beyond the land of Cathay. Who &s;o goeth from Cathay to Inde the high and the low, h&eacute;e &s;hall goe through a kingdome that men call Cadi&s;&s;en, and it is a great land, there groweth a manner of fruit as it were gourdes, and when it is ripe, men cut it a &s;under, and they finde therein a bea&s;t as it were of fle&s;h, and bone, &amp; blood, as it were a little lambe without wooll, and men eate the bea&s;t and fruit al&s;o, and &s;ure it &s;&eacute;emeth very &s;trange. Neuerthele&s;&s;e I &s;ayd to them that I held that for no meruaile, for I &s;aid that in my country are tr&eacute;es that beare fruit that become birds fly|ing &amp; they are good to eat, and that that falleth on the water li|ueth, and that that falleth on the earth dyeth, and they meruai|led much thereat.

Here &s;ome men might a&s;ke, if there be a &s;ea on one &s;ide, why goe they not out there, for thereto aun|&s;were I that although it be called a &s;ea, it is not a &s;ea, but a poole &s;tanding among hils, and it is the greate&s;t Poole of all the world, and though they go ouer that poole, yet they wot not where to ariue, for they can no &s;peach but their owne.

This Emperour <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn</HI> holdeth a great land, and many good cities and good townes. In his kingdome are many great Iles and large, for this land of Inde is parted into Iles becau&s;e of great flouds that come out of Paradi&s;e: and al&s;o in the &s;ea are many great Iles. The be&s;t cittie that is in the Ile of Pantrore is called Nile that is a noble cittie and a rich. <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn</HI> hath vnder him many kings and diuers people, and his land is good and rich, but not &s;o rich as the land of the great Caane, for merchants come not &s;o much thether as they doe into the land of the great Caane, for it is too long a iourney. And al&s;o they finde in the Ile of Cathay all things that they haue n&eacute;ede of, as &s;picery, clothes of gold and other riches, and although they might haue better cheape in the land of <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn,</HI> then in the land of Cathay, and more fine, ne|uerthele&s;&s;e they wil not go thether by rea&s;on of the length of the iourney, and great perils on the &s;ea, for there are many places in the &s;ea where are many rocks of a &s;tone that is called Ada|mand, the which of his owne kinde draweth to him all man|ner of iron, and therefore there may no &s;hips that haue iron nayles pa&s;&s;e, but it draweth them to it, and therefore they dare not go into that country with &s;hips for dread of the Adamand, I went once into that &s;ea &amp; &s;aw as it had b&eacute;ene a great Ile of tr&eacute;es, &s;tocks &amp; branches growing, and the &s;hipmen told me that tho&s;e were great &s;hips that abode there through the vertue of the Adamands, and of things that were in the &s;hips, whereof tho&s;e tr&eacute;es &s;prong and waxed, and &s;uch rocks are there ma|ny in diuers places of that &s;ea, and therefore dare there no

The land of <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn</HI> is long, and Merchants pa&s;&s;e thether through the land of Per&s;ia, and come vnto a Cit|tie that men call Hermes, for a Philo&s;opher that was called <HI>Hermes</HI> founded it, and then pa&s;&s;e an arme of the Sea, &amp; come to another Cittie that men call Saboth, and there finde they all marchandi&s;es, and popiniayes as great plenty as larks in our country.

There is a valley betw&eacute;ene two hils and that is foure myle long, and &s;ome men call it the valley enchaunted, &s;ome the valley of Diuels, &s;ome the valley perillous, and in that valley are many tempe&s;ts, and a great noy&s;e very hyde|ous both day and night, and &s;ound as it were a noyce of Ta|bers and Trumpets as it were at a great fea&s;t. This valley is full of Diuels and hath b&eacute;ene alway, and men &s;ay there is an entrie to hell. In this valley is much gold and &s;iluer, wher|fore many chri&s;tian men and other goe thether for coueti&s;e of that gold and &s;iluer, but few of them come out againe, for they are anone &s;trangled with Diuels, and in the midde&s;t of that Valley on a Rocke is a Vi&s;age, and the head of a flend bodely, right hidious and dreadfull to &s;&eacute;e, and there is nothing &s;&eacute;ene but the head to the &s;houlders, but there is no Chri&s;tian men nor other in the world &s;o hardy, but that h&eacute;e would b&eacute;e greatly afraid to b&eacute;ehold it, for h&eacute;e beholdeth each man &s;o &s;harp|ly and felly, and his eyes are &s;o &s;taring, and &s;parkling as fire, and h&eacute;e chaungeth &s;o oft his countenance that no man dare come n&eacute;ere for all the world, and out of his no&s;e commeth great plentie of fire of diuers colours, and &s;ometime is the fire &s;o &s;tinking, that no man may &s;uffer it, but alway a good Chri&s;ti|an man, and one that is &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith may goe therein without harme if they call to God onely for forgiuene&s;&s;e of their &s;innes, then &s;hall the Diuels haue no power ouer them. And y&eacute;e &s;hall vnder&s;tand that when my fellowes and I were in that valley we had full great doubt if w&eacute;e &s;hould put our bo|dies in a venture to goe through it, and &s;ome of my fellowes agr&eacute;ed thereto and &s;ome would not, and there were in our company two Fryers minours of Lombardie who &s;aid if any of vs would goe in they would al&s;o, as they had &s;ayd &s;o vpon tru&s;t of them w&eacute;e &s;ayd that w&eacute;e would goe, and w&eacute;e dyd

The fir&s;t floud is called Pi&s;on or Ganges, and that runneth through Inde: in that Riuer are many precious &s;tones and much Lig|num Aloes, and grauell of gold. An other is called Nilus or Giron, and that runneth through Ethiope and Aegypt. The third is called Tigr&eacute;e, and that runneth through A&s;iria and Armony the great. And the fourth is called Euphrates that runneth through Armony the le&s;&s;e, and Per&s;ia, and men &s;ay that the &s;w&eacute;et and fre&s;h waters of the world take their &s;pring|ing of them. The fir&s;t Riuer is called Pi&s;on, that is to &s;ay, ga|thering of many Riuers together and falling into one, and &s;ome call it Ganges, of a king that was in Inde that men call <HI>Gangeras,</HI> for it runneth through his land, and this riuer is in &s;ome places cleane, in &s;ome places troubled, in &s;ome place hot, in &s;ome place cold. The &s;econd riuer is called Nilus or Giron, for it is euer troubled, for Giron is to &s;ay, trouble. The third riuer is called Tigr&eacute;e, that is to &s;ay fa&s;t running, for it run|neth fa&s;ter then any of the other, named &s;o of a bea&s;t that men call Tigris, for h&eacute;e runneth fa&s;t.
