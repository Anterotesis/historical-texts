<P>IN my la&s;t I had not time to give you a &s;hort Narration of our Voyage and Misfor|tune &s;ince we departed <HI>India,</HI> which is as followeth:</P>
<P>We departed <HI>Surrat</HI> the 19th of <HI>January,</HI> 1694/5. and &s;aw the <HI>Cape of Good&punc; Hope</HI> about the 7th of <HI>April;</HI> the 8th, <HI>ditto,</HI> our Gunner by accident blew up, as we did &s;uppo&s;e, in &s;mall Ca&s;es, Powder-Horns and Granado-&s;hells, above 30 <HI>l.</HI> of Powder in the Gun-room, which fired our Ship. It plea&s;ed God, by cutting up our Decks, and throwing Water, we quencht it in about two hours. The Gunner died next day by the Wounds he received; his Mate is &s;till living, but has lo&s;t as yet the U&s;e of both his Hands. There were &s;everal others that had &s;mall hurts. About the 3d or 4th of <HI>May</HI> we &s;aw the I&s;land <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion;</HI> and the 10th of this in&s;tant we made the Land of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Latitude of 54. Degr. or thereabouts, it being very thick hazy Weather, and &s;o much Wind and Rain, that we could not deal with it. On <HI>Friday</HI> the 12th In&s;tant, about 7 in the morning, we made the <HI>Skellicks,</HI> &s;teering directly in with them, &s;till the Wind fre&s;h, thick Weather, and a great Sea. About 10 in the morning we &s;aw a Sail without us bearing down; we prepared our Ship for a Fight, and &s;till kept on our Cour&s;e towards the <HI>Skellicks.</HI> Ju&s;t as we got into the Sound, which was about 3 of the Clock, the Ship came up with us under En|gli&s;h Colours within a Ships length, and bid us &s;trike for King <HI>James.</HI> We told him, We would not. In An&s;wer he &s;aid, He would make us pre&s;ently, and in a very &s;hort time fired his Broad-&s;ide and Small Shot. We an&s;wered him with the like Salute. Then he laid us on Board athwart the Har&s;e, and entred about 100 Men on our Foreca&s;tle. The Broad-&s;ide he gave us by Misfortune carried away the Bulk-head of our Cuddy, and laid tho&s;e Clo&s;e Quarters quite open, and at the &s;ame time killed Mr. <HI>John Pluncknett</HI> a Gentleman on Board us; which forc'd the Men that were quartered there to retire into the Steeridge and great Cabbin. At the fir&s;t of the entring, by what Accident I know not, they took our Foreca&s;tle, where we had 15 Men quartered, of which they carried away 13, and left one dead, and another &s;adly mangled, his Right Hand being off, and his Mouth and Jaw &s;hot to pieces. All this time from the Steeridge Quarters we gauld them on our Foreca&s;tle, and on their Quarter and Poop, they &s;till halling away their Dead Men, and re-entring fre&s;h. We forc'd them to for&s;ake the top of our Foreca&s;tle; then they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Quarter-deck and Round-hou&s;e, and down our Stair-ca&s;e, which was open, they ca&s;t down G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">anada-&s;hells and Stink-pots, and fired Pi&s;tols, with which they wounded 2 Men; one of them died afterwards: We had nothing to return that could offend them but Huzzaes, that they might know we were in being; and &s;o guarded the Pa&s;&s;age, that they could not de&s;cend. In the Interim, after the Ships &s;taying 2 hours or more thwart our Har&s;e, they ca&s;t round our Starboard Bow along our &s;ide at about a Ships Breadth di&s;tance: We gave him a Broad-&s;ide, at the receiving of which he &s;tood off, and brought on the Careen, leaving about 40 or 50 Men on Board us. We forc'd them out of the Round-hou&s;e, and they lodg'd mo&s;t on the Poop (except &s;uch as were in our Tops cutting our Rigging, and in our Foreca&s;tle.) We de&s;ign'd to Sally, but our Small-Arms were all di&s;abled, having flown out of the Stocks, and cloyed with often firing; and &s;ome of the Locks broke, which we fired with Matches, one taking Aim, and the other giving Fire. Then we re&s;olved to convey half a Barrel of Powder into the Round-hou&s;e, to blow up the Poop, which accordingly we conveyed there, and fired, but did not the expected Ex|ecution. Finding no other means, but to venture at all, re&s;olving they &s;hould not have the Ship, we carried a whole Barrel of Powder into the former place, and &s;et Fire thereto, but it did not the expected Execution in blowing up the Deck; the rea&s;on we &s;uppo&s;e to be, was by the Bulk head being down, and the Powder decayed. Then we re&s;olved to Sally with our Swords, half Pikes, and Javelings, which accordingly we did; they having Fire-Arms were too hard for
<PB N="2" REF="2"> us; we had one Man killed, but took two of theirs Pri&s;oners: We Sallied again, and mounted the Quarter Deck; they being on the Poop, in the Mizen Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">rds and Tops, and &s;ome over the Ships Quarter: We bid them ca&s;t over-board their Arms, and they &s;hould have good Quarter, and they &s;aid if we did not lay down our Arms and Sur|render, we &s;hould have no Quarter: They fired &s;everal &s;mall Arms, which fired one of our Mens Eyes almo&s;t out, either they had no &s;hot in them, or were bad Marks-men, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t needs have killed many of us. After a long Parley, they begun to Surrender. The Ship was on fire on the Larboard Quarter, which I judge was cau&s;ed by the la&s;t Barrel of Powder we blew up. We &s;ecured their Offi|cers, and &s;et their Men and &s;ome of ours to the Pump, and putting the Fire out, o|thers to Trimming the Sails; the Rigging was &s;o much cut and &s;hot, that we could not brace the Yards, and &s;he was a &s;hoar immediately, and the Fire as high as the Mizen Top: In the interim we were doing this, the Ship &s;truck again&s;t the Rocks, about a Mile from a place called <HI>Vintrey,</HI> and three Miles from hence. The Man of War lay all this while hovering about a Mile from us: In the time of our Fight, we gave him our Larboard Guns, which was the la&s;t &s;alute he received from us: 'tis &s;up|pos'd he receiv'd more dammage than we can imagine; otherwi&s;e his Men &s;ay he would have boarded us again, for they call'd to him on our Poop to come, &s;ignifying if they did, the Ship would be theirs. After we had Conquered them that were on Board; we found they were 35, or 40 &s;ound men, far exceeding our Number; but the Ship running a &s;hoar, we all were left to the mercy of the Fire and Water, the fir&s;t was &s;oon got to our Main Ma&s;t. We had 3 Men killed, and about 7 wound|ed in the Action, 1 Dyed on the Rocks of his Wounds, and about 4 Drown'd and Starv'd with Cold: It was about 7 at Night when we ran a &s;hore, and nigh 12 be|fore all were got off, there going a great Sea. Here is con&s;tantly, as People tell us, Men of War and Privateers of the Enemies Cruizing off of this Port: I have &s;een 2 (three or four times) and now they lay nigh the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">asketts;</HI> tho' it plea&s;ed God four Days &s;ince, a &s;mall Ship called the <HI>Su&s;anna,</HI> belonging to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> about 100 T&uuml;nns, <HI>John Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">are</HI> Ma&s;ter, from <HI>Mevis,</HI> got &s;afe in. The Man of War that we fought, was of 36 Guns and 280 Men, called the <HI>Marine</HI> of <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> Commanded by Captain <HI>Neagle.</HI> They had a great many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> men on Board: Some of our Pri|&s;oners are <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men. The Country hath &s;ecured 27, the mo&s;t of note are E&s;caped. One <HI>Fitz Gerrard</HI> who was the Commi&s;&s;ary, had a Letter found in his Pocket, of &s;ome Importance.</P>

<P>What I have here Writ, is a True Account of the Action, and more we could not do to &s;ave the Ship. I thank God I e&s;caped with Life, and received no other Da|mage than a &s;mall Bla&s;t, which took the left &s;ide of my Face, and &s;corched me a little; my Eye was hurt, but now I thank God I am well of it. There is not a pro&s;pect of much to be &s;aved, for there is a Storm now which hath &s;hatter'd her bottom all to pieces, and the Canes are floating about the Sea.</P>
