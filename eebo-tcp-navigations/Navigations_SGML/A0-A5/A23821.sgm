<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOr your greater &s;atisfaction I am inclined, not only to vouch for the Author, and obviate what objections I imagin may be made again&s;t this brief account; but al&s;o to give my Opinion frankly, of Writings of this nature, and Voyages in general.</P>
<P>The Captain I know per&s;onally to be a man of Ingenuity and Skill in his Profe&s;&s;ion, and one of great Ve|racity: that he has been nicely care|ful not to mention the lea&s;t matter po&s;itively, but what he knows
<PB REF="5"> to be truth. The greate&s;t part of this account, he delivers from his own knowledge; and for what he &s;ays he was told, he was fully convinced of its reality, before he would make Report of it. 'Tis a mo&s;t abomina|ble thing for any one to go abroad, and return with a pretended Journal, of &s;urprizing Di&s;coveries and &s;trange Occurrences; and make a Lin&s;ey-Wool&s;ey &s;tory, part Matter of Fact, and part devi&s;ed: or perhaps the whole meer Romance or Fable. Mankind can reap no Improvement from &s;uch Relations; and Voyagers are but poor|ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted from &s;uch uncertain Dire|ctions, and &s;orry Informations. But &s;ome, perceiving how fond people are of tales, have put forth Travels patch'd together, and pick'd out of other Books; giving a new date to the Work and a new name to the Compiler; to gull the ignorant, and
<PB REF="5"> make a wi&s;e man mad. Whereas here can be no admittance of fallacy; for we tell you of what was done ye&s;ter|day, the per&s;on and place, and cir|cum&s;tances, if uncertain and fal&s;e, ea&s;y to be detected.</P>
<P>And if every one that goes into a Foreign Land, would be punctual to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">et down what he meets with there; be careful in ob&s;erving what is rare or u&s;eful; curious in Draughts of Coa&s;ts or Harbours, and bring home with him &s;pecimens or particulars of Plants or Animals, or ought el&s;e, as the Production or Commodity of the place; our Ob&s;ervations, as well Topographical as Natural, might become more full and perfect, and true Learning upon a bet|ter foundation. The mind of man is plea&s;ed and enlarged, when inform|ed of the diver&s;ity of Countries and differences of Climes; and without
<PB REF="6"> expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the hard&s;hip o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Travel, he may be qualify'd to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> due compari&s;on between the Earth under the Line, and nearer the Pole Our bodily wants more readily &s;up+ply'd by the Goods of one Country exchanged for tho&s;e of another which is as much as to &s;ay, Com|merce encrea&s;ed and enlivened, and Navigation rendred more ea&s;y and cheap and le&s;s dangerous. As to our <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Trade in particular, con&s;idera|ble as it is, and &s;o adjudged by the la&s;t Parliament, and the nece&s;&s;ity of doubling the North Cape, in going and returning, and often at un&s;ea|&s;onable times; what directions are here laid down? and what an u&s;e|ful di&s;covery, for any that &s;hall meet with the &s;ame di&s;a&s;ter in time to come? I have heard the Captain him&s;elf &s;ay, that had he known how the Lands lay; what anchoring places
<PB REF="6"> were in the <HI>Fuel,</HI> as well when he got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, as when he was forced in, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have made &s;hift to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the way out, dark as the &s;ea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">on was, in a few days after. And he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ad rea&s;on to think as well of his own under&s;tanding in this part of the world, as any one living, having made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> great many Voyages thither, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">arly and late in the year. 'Tis true, all Maps lately have made the Cape an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;land, but very imperfectly delinea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the Inlets or Streights; and who knows not, but in time they may be found &s;afe to be pa&s;&s;ed, when cro&s;s Winds forbid them going about.</P>
<P>But in looking further into this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ournal, I gue&s;s &s;ome one may not &s;o well like, to read &s;o often of Winds; &s;o much of Fro&s;t and Snow; the di&s;mal attendants of Winter. He thinks, that to &s;ay nothing in Com|pany, but 'tis a foul day, or very un|&s;ea&s;onable
<PB REF="7"> weather, is a &s;ign of grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> want of matter of di&s;cour&s;e. All thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> is granted to be a fault in time an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> place, when Invention is at liberty and where we have plenty of Subject to talk upon. 'Tis one thing to kee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trict to a Diary, for the natural Hi+&s;tory of a Country, and anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> thing with the liberty of a Poet to write a Shepherds Calendar. Ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> is no other way of giving any one the Idea of the Temperature of a Climate, than by remarking the weather daily, and the hourly changes of it.</P>
<P>Others may be mightily chagreen'd at the tedious entertainment of every days letting fall the Anchor, and heaving it up again; of hoi&s;ting and lowering their Yards and Top-Ma&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It might be no great diver|&s;ion to tho&s;e that did it, but it may be &s;ome to the Reader, if it does but
<PB REF="7"> rai&s;e his pity and compa&s;&s;ion for 'em, under &s;o much labour, and &s;uch &s;len|der refre&s;hment; &s;uch uncomforta|ble dark work, with &s;uch muzzel'd hands almo&s;t without Fingers, and Limbs &s;o benumm'd and feeble to perform it. Neither was it altogether nece&s;&s;ary, or meerly impos'd by their Captain as exerci&s;e; but in order to their &s;afety, and to keep them&s;elves in a po&s;ture, &s;uitable to their reviving hopes of getting away It cannot be omitted in relating their &s;ufferings, and how they &s;pent their time, as being part of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>Others again are &s;trangely offend|ed at the perpetual mentioning of Dills. Periwinkles, Scallops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet if the&s;e minute matters had not been &s;et down, they would be ready to &s;ay, how did they go to work to live all the while? they ought to an|&s;wer them&s;elves, and to be &s;atisfy'd;
<PB REF="8"> commend the vigilant Ma&s;ter, for providing &s;o well for his Hou&s;e, in ordering to each his proportion, and &s;o equally directing their &s;ervices, for the pre&s;ervation of the whole Family.</P>
<P>The &s;ame an&s;wer will &s;erve for Wooding and Watering; their man|ner of doing and repeating it with &s;uch toil and hazard.</P>
<P>Perhaps a refin'd Lingui&s;t may be di&s;|gu&s;ted at &s;o much Tarpawling expre&s;|&s;ion, and &s;o many words not allow'd to be <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t tell him, that this Watry Language, is brought upon Land to be &s;hipt off again &s;peedily; for the &s;ake of &s;uch, who under&s;tand it readily, and have heard it in its proper place. And then I appeal to Gentlemen and Scho|lars: for per&s;ons of Candour and Learning will con&s;ider, that to go about to expre&s;s this in other terms would make it all Paraphra&s;e, and
<PB REF="8"> that wretched &s;tiff and formal. Be|&s;ides, the words them&s;elves are ex|pre&s;&s;ive enough and di&s;tingui&s;hing, and what a Language need not be a&s;ham'd of They are what are found in other Books of the &s;ame &s;ubjects; and if they are not, 'tis pity they &s;hould not be received, or made a part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, by joyning them with others of com|mon u&s;e, and more known. For &s;ome ea&s;e to &s;uch, an explanation in the Margin has been added to a few, and if they will plea&s;e to make en|quiry into the others, they will have the plea&s;ure of becoming more knowing than before.</P>
<P>In a word, our Author has ex|actly ob&s;erved the order of time, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively mentioned the days, without &s;o doing a Journal would be lame and defective. His abound|ing in minute Pa&s;&s;ages, and light

<P>Accordingly I hauled up my Fore-Sail, that I might &s;ee before me while the Squauls of Snow fell; which after they were pa&s;t, I &s;et again: U&s;ing all Diligence that could be, in &s;earch of &s;ome &s;helter from Land, or place of Anchorage.</P>
<P>At one in the Afternoon I di&s;covered an I&s;land which had a &s;mall Breach off it; but the men in the Tops, and on the Yards, &s;aid the opening next the Main was &s;o large, that no &s;ecurity could be under it. Then I &s;teered my cour&s;e to the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Fuel,</HI> (for the I&s;land afore&s;aid lay on the We&s;t) and running up S. E. I &s;aw &s;ome|thing like a Bay; but the Hills &s;eemed &s;o &s;teep, that I was loath to &s;hoot my &s;elf into it, for fear of having no Anchor Ground. For 'tis generally ob&s;erved by us in &s;uch Countries, if the Hills be very high near the Water, there are commonly great depths at little di&s;tance. So that looking further a|head I e&s;pyed a &s;hore, as I thought, with a hand&s;ome de&s;cent: and concluding &s;uch places more likely for my purpo&s;e, I &s;et my Fore-top-&s;ail and Main-&s;ail. Then came a &s;ore Squaul, which forced me to hand my Fore-top-&s;ail, and haul up my Main-&s;ail; but before the Squaul was over, I was got
<PB N="9" REF="15"> pa&s;t that Bay: Yet then I &s;aw another point, and our Water &s;moothed much. For that I made way, and ran clo&s;e to it, &s;till find|ing no ground with our Lead; but on the other &s;ide of the point went in a great Bay. With keeping the Lead, I came about the point, and found 25 fathom Water, &s;oft Ground: then I let go my Anchor, and got my Skiff out, to carry a Haulfer a&s;hore; which was no &s;ooner done, but the Eddy Winds came off the Hills upon the point, and &s;wung the Ships Stern &s;omewhat too near the &s;hore.</P>
<P>But the Squaul being over, the wind ea&s;ed, and blowing more into the Bay, (which by it its looks promi&s;ed well) I hove up my anchor, and drove further, into the depth of 40 fathom; letting it then drop again. By this time it grew dark; &s;o we gave her a whole Cable, and rode in 16 fathom. Then after all things were &s;towed, and we thought our &s;elves very well, and went to &s;upper, I felt the Ship to rub on the ground. I im|mediately commanded the Lead to be heaved over the Poop, and found there was not a|bove two fathom Water. Then I cau&s;ed two Fakes of the Cable to be taken in, and we rode with our Stern in 7 fathom
<PB N="10" REF="16"> Whereupon I got a &s;mall Anchor and Haul&s;er into my Boat, and rowed into the flat Bay, in 16 fathom; by which means I heaved the Ship further into the depth afore|&s;aid, with very good ground. At the &s;ame time I ordered the Boat to &s;ound round the Ship, and found the place where I rubb'd on the ground, to be a point of Rocks lying from the Main on the South &s;ide, but all o|ver the Bay el&s;e to be good Ground. So we lay all night.</P>
<P>26th, <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> by day light I &s;ent a Boat with a Mate, to &s;ee how things were about us; who reported that in the bottom of the Bay run in a good Harbour, and likewi&s;e that &s;ome Hou&s;es were in &s;ight: but upon my re-&s;ending the Boat, they were found without Inhabitants.</P>
<P>By that time the&s;e &s;earches had been made, night came on. (Note that we ac|counted &s;o much light to make day, as was &s;ufficient to read by, or wherewith we were able to di&s;cern a Boat at half a miles di|&s;tance.

<P>27th, <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> at break of day, I got my be&s;t Bow-anchor aboard, and warped further into the Bay, where I Rid, having withal two Haul&s;ers fa&s;tned to a Rock on &s;hore. We continued to fit the Ship for the Sea, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to give us opportunity. The wind was yet Northerly, clear weather, &s;o that we &s;aw Land on the We&s;t &s;ide over again&s;t us, which we &s;aw not the day of our fir&s;t coming in, and I judged it might be eight miles off.</P>
<P>28th, <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> This day proved very bad weather, with much Snow, and the Wind &s;hifting &s;ometime at N. E. at N. and N. W. &s;o that we could not but acknow|ledge the Providence of God, in directing us to move where we were: for had it not been done, we mu&s;t have been blown from
<PB N="12" REF="17"> our former place. Then I went my &s;elf to &s;earch, and &s;ounded the Bay and Harbour all over, and made what di&s;covery I cou'd of things about us; finding a good watering place, and plenty of Wood near at hand, At my return, upon complaint of &s;ome of our mens embezeling and &s;tealing our Bread, I ordered it to be locked up. For it began to look with little Hopes of getting out till the light Moon came. We got a Boats load of Wood, and one of Water, that night on Board; and began to con&s;ider further, as to our &s;afety in that place, &s;hould the Wind We&s;ter, and break our Haul&s;er a&s;hore.</P>
<P N="29">29, <HI>Friday,</HI> at break of day, I went and &s;ounded from my Bow-Anchor to the Ea&s;t|ern &s;hore, and found 40 Fathom a little from it, &s;till depthning towards the &s;aid &s;hore. Whereupon arguing with my &s;elf, that after removal of the Ship further in, I might &s;et &s;ail, and come out out as ea&s;ily, and yet in the mean time be &s;ecure in the wor&s;t weather; I removed farther into the Harbour, even to the place where we lay all Winter. This we had &s;carce done, and made our Ship fa&s;t, but it began to blow right in, and &s;oon after it proved &s;uch a

<P N="30">30th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> I moored the Ship with two Bowers to the Offen, along the Bank; that is to &s;ay, one to the South Ea&s;t, and the other to the North We&s;t, and carried both the Kedge Anchor and Warp Anchor a&s;hore, and placed them together, each with one Flook in the dry &s;hore, burying them with Stones, for the better holding.

<PB N="24" REF="24"> when I found po&s;&s;ible, I ordered the Car|penter to cut a new Mizen-Ma&s;t I had on Board, not yet u&s;ed. Of the bigge&s;t end I took twelve foot, and (after a hole of 7 foot deep had been digged, with no &s;mall Labour) I placed it, filling the hole with Earth, Stones, and Water, which being frozen, might the better fix it, as a po&s;t for a Cable to be fa&s;tned to. But that night I forbore u&s;ing it; being not willing to &s;hake it, before it was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. The little Light we had was not above 5 hours continuance.</P>
<P>The 19th, <HI>Friday.</HI> It blew &s;trongly from the S. S. Ea&s;t, and held very clear. As &s;oon as it was light I got my be&s;t Bow|er-Cable hauled up; I took al&s;o a peice of a Junck Cable about twenty Fathom long, and made it fa&s;t to the Stake above menti|oned (which &s;tood off to the S. and by W.) and &s;ea&s;ed an Eye at the other end. Then I took one end of my be&s;t Bower Ca|ble, (the other being fa&s;t to the Anchor) and after I had made an Eye on that al&s;o, with two Louff-Tackles, I brought both as near as I could together, which was within 3 fathom, and &s;ea&s;ed them.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="24">
<P>This I had &s;carce done, but there came down &s;o much Wind at S. S.

<P N="20">20th <HI>Saturday.</HI> By the fir&s;t light of our &s;lender day, we perceived our Skiffe full of water at our Stern, which we hoi&s;ted on Board to mend again. You mu&s;t note we could keep no Night Watch; our men not being able to walk the Deck half an hour for Cold.</P>
<P>I now made &s;trict Enquiry into the quan|tity we had of Pea&s;e left, getting a Barrel out, and mea&s;uring them. Of the&s;e after|ward I delivered out 4 Quarts a day for all our Ships Company, being 24 men and Boys, and this I did four days in a week. I like|wi&s;e made &s;earch into our other pro|vi&s;ions, and found we had 530 pieces of Beef, of four pound each.

<PB N="26" REF="25"> a day, for four men, with a Kettle of Ha&s;ty Pudding, for the whole Ships com|pany; that being the be&s;t way of u&s;ing my Flower.

<P N="21">21&s;t <HI>Sunday.</HI> One of our Boys com|plained of his Feet being &s;ore, our Chirur|geon immediately viewing them, found the effect of the Fro&s;t there up to his Ankles; e&s;pecially one very dangerou&s;ly: but by his Skill and Diligence, he recovered them in Ten Days.</P>
<P N="22">22d <HI>Monday.</HI> It proving fair, we fetch|ed a Boat of Wood; great quantities of which we burnt every day. And here it will not be ami&s;s to mention our manner of keeping Fire. I cau&s;ed the Iron Hearth in the Fore-Ca&s;tle to be brought into the Steerage, and ordered the Carpenter to make a Hearth as big as conveniently could &s;tand in the Fore Ca&s;tle; which was five foot nine inches &s;quare every way. Then I &s;ent a&s;hore for as much Clay, and as many
<PB N="27" REF="25"> Stones as filled it up: this was &s;ufficient to accommodate &s;ixteen men &s;itting clo&s;e about it at once. Moreover, I directed the Cooper for making a Chimney to the Steerage, in the manner following, <HI>viz.</HI> by &s;taving an empty Butt or Pipe, and reducing the &s;taves at one end, to the breadth of two inches each, &s;o that being Hoopt again, it exceed|ed not the widene&s;s of a Firkin at the Top, keeping the former breadth or capa|city in the middle, &s;till enlarging or &s;tand|ing more open at the bottom. The di|&s;tances or inter&s;tices there between the Staves, we filled with pieces of Wood, and made all tight with Clay and Stones; which when we had &s;o fini&s;hed, we placed upon the Grating. This made the Steerage very warm; but in all the time we kept Fire there, we were obliged to keep the door open for admittance of Wind, to give the Smoak vent.</P>
<P>About eight this night the Wind came to the S. S. E. with Snow and hard Fro&s;t; but at two in the Morning, there was clear good weather.</P>

<P N="24">24th <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> It proved fair and clear, the Wind Southerly. We cleared the Deck of Snow and Ice, which was grown a foot thick near the Scuppers. 'Twas &s;ometimes &s;quauly, but at eventide I &s;aw the Northern Glance: That is, a &s;tream of light enlightening all the He|mi&s;phere, &s;o as one may read very well with it. 'Tis of a Pale-Yellow or Buff-Colour, like the Inmo&s;t Circle of the Rain-bow, appearing for a Quarter of an hour, then vani&s;hing and renewing it &s;elf again, by intervals during the &s;pace of five or &s;ix hours. Sometimes this Meteor &s;eems a bright nim|ble moving Cloud; at another time two of them, ru&s;hing and encountring one another, like Armies engaged: and now and then I have thought with a grumbling noi&s;e akin to Thunder. We reckon the Fro&s;t to occa|&s;ion them, and whatever Reflects or E|mitts the light in that manner, can|not

<P N="25">25th <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> It being fair, I endea|voured to clear the Haw&s;e, but there was &s;o much Ice upon the Cables, I could not do it. This day two of my men went up the Hills, but wanted Light to make a di&s;|covery.</P>
<P N="26">26th <HI>Friday.</HI> Still fair and clear, and by the Light we had, I brought my be&s;t Bower Cable, to the Stake on &s;hore, and &s;erved it well with old Ropes, to prevent its cha|&s;ing: the Wind at E. N. E. and freezing hard.</P>
<P>The 27th <HI>Saturday.</HI> It proved fair and Calm, with &s;ome little Snow. I got a boat|load of Water; and &s;erved all our Cables to prevent Chafing, both a&s;hore and at the Haw&s;e.</P>
<P>I had complaint made me, that &s;ome had &s;toln Fi&s;h and broiled it; but upon &s;trict enquiry, I found &s;uch a thing could not be done privately: by rea&s;on our men &s;at con|&s;tantly round the Hearth in the Fore-Ca&s;tle, from 6 or 7 in the Morning till 8 at night;
<PB N="30" REF="27"> at which hour, or &s;oon after, I ever cau&s;ed the Fire to be put out, fearing the conti|nual keeping it might endanger the Ship, or occa&s;ion other Di&s;orders. Neverthele&s;s I cau&s;ed the Fi&s;h that hung overboard for watering, to be hauled in, and viewing it well, by the manner of it, I judged that the pieces dimini&s;hed, were not cut off with a Knife, bur rather &s;eemed bitten by &s;ome living Creature; which I &s;uppo&s;ed might be a Seal, that I had &s;een &s;ometimes about the Ship. So I put the Salt-fi&s;h into a Bag, and by a Line hung it over the Ship for fre&s;hning: And in the mean time I got a great Shark-hook, and baited it with a piece of the &s;ame; hanging it a foot under water, in a place where the Seal u&s;ed to &s;how him&s;elf. I &s;tood upon the Watch; and ju&s;t as it was dark, the Seal came and took it, making a bu&s;tling at the &s;ide of the Ship. I pre&s;ently took hold of the Rope, to which it was fa&s;tned, and found it too heavy for me, which made me call for help; but before it came he got loo&s;e, and I &s;aw him &s;et his Feet to the Ships &s;ide, and fling him&s;elf off: After this we &s;aw him no more in the Bay.</P>

I carried things with me, for clearing the way to the Doors from Snow; and approaching them, I found the dwelling Hou&s;es were built above 5 foot from the Ground, and 12 foot broad, in form round. The Walls were made of Stones, and Mo&s;s between them, in&s;tead of Morter, and Roofed with the &s;ame, by the help of Rafters or Split Trees, their lower ends re&s;ting upon the wall, and their upper joining at the top again&s;t a hollow Stone, which &s;erved both for Chimney and Win|dow.

Likewi&s;e upon the Hills that were bare by the Thaw, they found plenty of Green Juniper, of which they gathered, and brought on board a great many Branches. Withal they peeled off the Ten|der Bark of the Willow-like Tree, and bound it up in &s;everal Bundles, to hang near the Fire and dry, for an intended u&s;e.

Afterward &s;ome went a&s;hore with the Pole and Net afore&s;aid, and got &s;tore of Eggs: while others went a Gun|ning, who &s;hot only a &s;mall Fowl calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Greenland</HI> Pidgeon.

The&s;e flew often near the Ship, and at length were &s;o tame, as to light upon our Deck: one of which our men &s;hot, poor and lean as he was, and nothing but Skin, Bone and Fea|thers. But before I came away I &s;aw &s;eve|ral of the <HI>Greenland</HI> Doves afore&s;aid, and Fowls like what we call Kitties, pick up things at low water, which I gue&s;&s;ed might be Periwinkles, and Sea Eggs e&s;pecially&punc; For one day, (though I have not &s;et it down punctually, I bear it well in mind,) I went my &s;elf a&s;hore, and a furlong up the Hills, I found the Shells of Sea Eggs, which

<P>The 23d, <HI>Sunday.</HI> We had it fair and clear all day, the Wind Southerly, and the Fro&s;t very moderate.</P>
<P>The 24th, <HI>Monday.</HI> Still fair and clear, the Wind Southerly. We got our Kedge Anchor on Board, but much trouble had we to come at it. We were forced to dig through a great deal of Ice, and the ground it &s;elf frozen deep, under which one flook had been long buryed. We &s;hifted one of our &s;mall Haul&s;ers too, at the &s;take where the Cable was fa&s;t: got both our Top-ma&s;ts up, hoi&s;ted our Mizen-yard, and got our Fore-yards up, with an intent to be jog|ging; but before night, it began to blow at S. S. W.</P>
<PB N="56" REF="40">
<P>The 25th, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> It blew very hard, in|&s;omuch that I was forced to &s;trike both Top|ma&s;ts, and lower all down again. Be&s;ides, it froze extreamly hard all this 24 hours. Thus were we fatally baulked, and our de|&s;ign of &s;tirring put a &s;top to, when we had Provi&s;ion enough left, to go to Sea with; I can't &s;ay without great hazard of want, and danger of weather, could we have held on our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The 26th, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> It continued &s;till blowing, and the Wind all Southerly, &s;o that at certain times, when the bla&s;ts came violently off the Hills, notwith&s;tanding the Haw&s;e was very foul and thick frozen, yet the Cable would be pulled &s;tark out of the Water. The Haul&s;er too at the &s;take on &s;hore, having a great weight of Ice upon it, would neverthele&s;s be &s;tiff-&s;trained above the Water, as level as that of a Rope-dan|cer, when it is made fit to walk upon. It being to admiration, that the Stake, Cable and Haul&s;ers &s;hould hold.</P>
<P>The 27th, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> The Wind and weather &s;till the &s;ame as the day before; blowing fiercely, but clear over head, and freezing at a great rate.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="40">
<P>The 28th, <HI>Friday.</HI> The Wind kept its place, but grew more moderate; the Fro&s;t &s;till exce&s;&s;ive: However I got a boat load of water, and another of wood.</P>
<P>The 29th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> It blew &s;martly out of the South, and froze &s;o extraordinary hard, that the water we brought on board the day before, was a &s;olid Body of Ice. For having occa&s;ion to Brew that morning, (it being late before the water came on board over night) I cau&s;ed one of the Hog|&s;heads to be digged into, to &s;ee if any wa|ter could be found in the Cask; and in the mid&s;t there might be the quantity of about two Gallons lying in a hole of the depth of 14 inches, and 3 inches width: of that I made Mead, which proved excellent good, and &s;ome of the very &s;ame, I brought with me to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The 30th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> It blew a hard Gale at S. by E. freezing withal; but not &s;o hard as two days before.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t, <HI>Monday.</HI> We had as much Wind as the day before, and from the &s;ame point; but dry overhead, and freezing to
<PB N="58" REF="41"> extremity. There was a Hog&s;head that &s;tood an end upon the Deck, full of Water with its head open, which froze gradually downward, &s;o as to force the bottom out, and rai&s;e the Cask three inches from the place it &s;tood on: and became a whole Co|lumn or Solid Body of Ice. Another at the &s;ame time that laid along with its Bung open, froze in the like manner, bur&s;ting open the undermo&s;t &s;taff upon which it re&s;ted. I leave to the Reader to a&s;&s;ign the natural rea&s;on of this, only taking along with him this remark; that it lay upon a pretty thick Ice that covered the Deck. How long they had been both filled I can|not &s;ay punctually: the fir&s;t might be one of them brought on Board the <HI>Friday</HI> be|fore; the other po&s;&s;ibly have lain longer, as de&s;igned for a Sea &s;tore. This brings into con&s;ideration the daily toil our Cook had, with an Iron Crow to break a&s;under Lumps of Ice to put into the Pot. In doing which he was obliged to arm his Hands with Furr Gloves and Mittens; otherwi&s;e the Iron would have cleaved to his Fingers and carryed the Skin along with it. The &s;ame Cloathing or defence our men con&s;tantly u&s;ed, not only abroad in Wooding and Watering, but al&s;o in their work aboard,
<PB N="59" REF="41"> as handling the Ropes, or whatever el&s;e they touched or moved. Over and above, when they went in the Boat upon frequent expeditions, whether for carrying out, or weighing of Anchors, or going a&s;hore for the many purpo&s;es before-cited, they put on their <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>-Boots, which were wide like tho&s;e worn by Fi&s;hermen, and lined with Bears-skin. The&s;e they were all fur|ni&s;hed with, but two or three, who were glad to &s;upply the want of them, by tying old pieces of Canvas about their Legs, and over their Feet.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> It continued &s;till blowing hard at S. by E. clear withal; and about noon we &s;aw the Sun &s;hine into the mouth of the Harbour. He might &s;hew the whole of his face, but little of his power; for it froze &s;o exce&s;&s;ively this day, that the Ice hung upon the Ship in &s;ome places full two foot thick, and at the edge of the Water it was of a great breadth. So that the Ship having a &s;mall motion, made &s;uch a noi&s;e, that the night before we could not &s;leep for it. To prevent which, we hauled the Long-boat about the &s;ides, and with two great Beetles or Mauls broke it off: and &s;ometimes a piece
<PB N="60" REF="42"> of half a Tun weight would drop at once.</P>
<P>The 2d, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> It blew hard at South, with clear weather, but froze &s;o very hard, that now all the Cables were pa&s;t handling; which mightily di&s;couraged us, and almo&s;t &s;tifled all thoughts of go|ing. To mention all the Di&s;cour&s;es our people had at times, and upon &s;everal oc|currences, would fill a bigger Volume; and a great many more I had &s;et down, had it not been &s;o great a trouble to write. 'Twas vexatious enough to get my Ink ready for u&s;e, and no le&s;s to keep it &s;o; a Boy being forced to thaw it, as oft as I had occa&s;ion to dip my Pen.</P>
<P>The 3d, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> All the night pa&s;t &s;tormy, and the Wind Southerly, but it froze not &s;o hard as the day before; we got a Boat load of Wood, and another of Water. As moderate as the weather was for cold, po&s;&s;ibly on &s;uch a day, we might get the Water on board in the Hog&s;heads, with little or no Ice on the &s;ur|face of it; but after &s;tanding half an hour upon Deck, we &s;hould have it thick enough to bear an empty Pipe. This was a warm day
<PB N="61" REF="42"> comparatively, I &s;ay, and cheri&s;hed our dying hopes of getting from this place; and towards night we got up our Fore Top-Ma&s;ts, Fore Yard and Mizen Yard, to be in a readine&s;s for the Sea.</P>
<P>The 4th, <HI>Friday.</HI> In the morning it blew a hard &s;torm at South, &s;o that I was compelled once more to &s;trike our Yards and Top-ma&s;ts: But towards night the Wind ea&s;ed, and we got our Stream Cable on board; leaving a piece of twenty fa|thom behind us, &s;o deep buried under the Ice on &s;hore, as not to be got out.</P>
<P>The 5th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> The day began with fine weather, the Wind at S. S. W. Our men di&s;covered Scallop-&s;hells near the Ship, but they lay in deep water. I cau&s;ed a broad flat piece of Iron to be bent like a Dredge to fi&s;h for Oy&s;ters with, and ordered a Bag to be made to it of Rope Yarn: and that night we went a dragging, and got &s;ixteen Scallops, which were very good Victu|als. I brought home with me &s;ome of the&s;e, and &s;everal other Shells, of which I carele&s;sly di&s;po&s;ed of, or lo&s;t the mo&s;t part: But when I waited upon that ingeni|ous and worthy per&s;on Mr <HI>James Petiver,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="43"> Apothecary in <HI>Alder&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> and Fellow of the Royal Society, to pre&s;ent him with tho&s;e few I had remaining; from them and others he &s;hewed me, I remembred they were almo&s;t all of &s;uch kinds as are found about <HI>England.</HI> And by him I was further informed, that the general <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> names I had given to them were not impro|per: More di&s;tinctly he told me they were Periwinkles, Wilks, <HI>Scarborough</HI> Couvins, Limpets, Mu&s;cles, Cockles, Sea Eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Oy&s;ter-&s;hells too I &s;aw here and there, but not one whole, with the Inwards or Meat in it. I left with him likewi&s;e a piece or two of Coral, got when we dragged for the&s;e Shell Animals; having &s;aved greater variety of the &s;ame, which an unlucky Boy threw over-board. Moreover, &s;ome Slate|like Stones; and the&s;e I ob&s;erved there of various colours, which when we held a|gain&s;t the Grind&s;tone, tinged the water (it turned in) &s;trongly of the &s;ame colour. And in &s;ome Colour-&s;hops where I expo&s;ed them here in <HI>London,</HI> they concluded them fit for Painters u&s;e, and of good value. So that this wretched Country was not de&s;ti|tute of all Humane Food or Commodity: and had I been there in a &s;ea&s;on when the Snow was gone, much more might have
<PB N="63" REF="43"> been ob&s;erved; or even then, had I made it more my bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cover what was odd or rare. Towards night the Wind came to the N. N. W. blowing hard and &s;nowing.</P>
<P>The 6th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> It proved fair and clear, till three in the afternoon; then the Wind &s;hifted from the N. W. to South, and began to blow and overca&s;t.</P>
<P>The 7th, <HI>Monday.</HI> It blew hard in the morning at N. N. We&s;t, and from thence the Wind &s;hifted to W. S. W. I took now into further con&s;ideration the quantity of provi&s;ion I had left, and finding not above 203 pieces of Beef, and Pea&s;e proportiona|ble; and &s;eeing no likelihood of getting any other relief while we &s;tay'd here, than what we had met with, I put my men to &s;treighter allowance, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ix men to a piece of Beef a day, and a pint of Pea&s;e for four men. And to prevent all di&s;content and murmuring, I kept my &s;elf, as I had done all along, upon the level with them; giving them leave to take the fir&s;t piece in choice, and I the &s;econd for my own Me&s;s. Withal, I encouraged them daily to get what provi&s;ion of &s;u&s;tenance they could
<PB N="64" REF="44"> from &s;hore: having fini&s;hed our Dragg, and fixed two Nets for catching Sea Eggs, of which we got this day three Bu&s;hels. The&s;e were the means of tempering, as well as &s;paring our Salt-fle&s;h, which we &s;hould have more need of at Sea, where we &s;hould be bereaved of the helps this Harbour af|forded us. Alas! Had we had but &s;tore of proper and cheri&s;hing food, our &s;ufferings from the cold would have been ea&s;ily born, by &s;o many hardy and lu&s;ty men as I had then on board, with the plenty of firing we met with. Nay, had I been &s;o lucky as to have brought, what I u&s;ually did in former Voyages, quantities of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Hams and Neats-Tongues, they would have af|forded great &s;upport under &s;uch woful di|&s;tre&s;&s;es. But to heighten the misfortune, I was ba&s;ely di&s;appointed at my coming a|way, of a thou&s;and weight of Stock-fi&s;h, which I had agreed for, to take with me as Ship-provi&s;ion. Strong <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>-Beer too, (not to mention High Wines and Brandy) had been comfortable drinks in cold days; as I found by that little I had in Bottles, which I kept buried up in Straw, and pre&s;erved mo&s;tly from the fro&s;t there|by; howbeit now and then the Boy fetch|ing a Bottle, would bring the neck in one

You mu&s;t know that for the&s;e four Months pa&s;t, &s;ince we came in here, we &s;uffered our Beards to grow at length for warmne&s;s; which would be often full of Icycles, from our Breath congealed, after the expo&s;ing our &s;elves for a little while upon Deck: but approaching the fire they came off ea&s;ily, whereas to have pulled them before, had been to bring hair and all.</P>
<P>The 19th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> We had little Wind this day, and that at N. W. but much Snow,
<PB N="70" REF="47"> and Fro&s;t &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for a man to look to Windward. In the mornings, after &s;uch bitter nights as we had at this time, the Gla&s;s Windows of my Round-hou&s;e where I lay, would have Ice upon them, of the thickne&s;s of a Crown piece; &s;o that we were forced to &s;crape it off with a Knife to let in the Light. The great Cabbin Windows we kept &s;hut up, with boards nailed without; as well for the pre|&s;ervation of them again&s;t weather, as warmth, for the ten men I lodged there con|&s;tantly. The Round-hou&s;e I re&s;erved to my &s;elf, though much colder; but I kept that in regard to the Provi&s;ion I had &s;towed therein. And to make known to them, that I had &s;hared the &s;ufferings with 'em, I &s;hew'd them my Bed, which was frozem to the Boards on each &s;ide, that I dur&s;t not allow the Boy to &s;tir it, for fear of Tearing, thus for 5 months I left it, and went to it morning and night, not pulling off my Cloaths, &s;ave for &s;hift|ing; only putting on my Furr-Gown at my ari&s;ing, and plucking it off when I laid down, to throw over me, together with the Rugs and Blankets. And long &s;ince, find|ing the Inconveniency of going from the Fire in the Steerage, where I re&s;ided by day, to my Lodging at Night, by rea&s;on of the
<PB N="71" REF="47"> Snow, that laid upon the Quarter Deck, I ordered the Carpenter to Caulk up the Round-hou&s;e door; &s;o I made my pa&s;&s;age by a Scuttle or Sally Port down into the great Cabbin, and by that means ob&s;erved the order they kept below me. As I lay in my Bed, I could di&s;tingui&s;h and tell every Nail in the Ceiling or el&s;ewhere, either head or point, having a piece of Ice like E|namel upon it. I &s;uppo&s;e from my moi&s;t breath conden&s;ed and froze. My Books too that &s;tood upon a &s;helf over my Head, had upon their edges and corners the &s;ame orna|ment; a &s;ight I cannot &s;ay, whether more plea&s;ant or di&s;mal.</P>
<P>The 20th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> 'Twas Calm, with much Snow falling, and continued Fro&s;t; notwith&s;tanding I got up our Fore-yard and Mizen-yard in the Evening, in hopes of an Ea&s;t Wind: but by night, it came to We&s;t, continuing fair.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, <HI>Monday.</HI> This morning was calm and fair, after a &s;erene and &s;harp freez|ing night; &s;o that we could not but ob&s;erve the &s;urface of the water in the Bay about us, to be covered with a hard Scum or thin Ice; which made us fear being lockt up: But
<PB N="72" REF="48"> immediately the Wind ari&s;ing at We&s;t broke it all away. We got a Hog&s;head of Water, and knockt off the Ice round the Ship, at the edge of the Water; and in the Evening our men went a&s;hore, for recruiting their fre&s;h Provi&s;ion: and towards night it blew &s;o hard, that I was forced to lower our yards down again.</P>
<P>The 22d, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> The day began with good weather enough as to Wind, only we had &s;ome Squauls of Snow; it froze too, but very moderately. We got a Boat of Wood; and our men going up the Hill a great height a Wooding, &s;aw the Body of the Sun; reporting it when they came aboard with great Joy. And indeed it was a &s;ight for them to rejoyce at, having never &s;een it &s;ince they came into this Har|bour. For it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, we lay low in the Water, that we had le&s;s Light for that rea&s;on; yet was the want of that compen&s;ated, by a more benign Tem|perature of the Air as to cold, than we &s;hould have found upon any part of the &s;hore. For I am per&s;waded, that no Hou&s;e we might have made there, could with the &s;ame manner of warming it, that we made u&s;e of in the Ship, have pre&s;erved us &s;o well. Be&s;ides a coldne&s;s perhaps from the
<PB N="73" REF="48"> Earth it &s;elf; I am &s;ure a &s;mall height in the Atmo&s;phere, makes a &s;en&s;ible Variation as to heat and cold in the &s;ame place: Not to offer at any Rea&s;on, but our men found it &s;o by daily experience, when they made but &s;mall a&s;cents in Wooding and Watering. And the Mountains, or greater Hills which lay about us, being, as near as I could gue&s;s, above three hundred Fathom higher than the &s;urface of the water in the Bay, &s;eemed to have endured the utmo&s;t force of the Fro&s;t; having Crowns or Caps of Ice; three or four Fathom thick in &s;ome places, and over-hanging like a Pent-hou&s;e or Precipice, with a horrid pro&s;pect at di&s;tance.</P>
<P>We took 2 turns off the Haw&s;e, cleaned the Ships Deck of Snow and Ice, and clear|ed the Scuppers. At midnight it began to blow a &s;torm at S. W. but towards morn|ing the Wind came to the N. W. by W. the Storm continuing: &s;o that I was forced to let fall my Sheat-Anchor.</P>
<P>The 23d, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> The Wind held hard at W. N. W. with much Snow; about 10 in the Forenoon, the Wind came to N. E. by N. continuing to Snow. At noon we heaved up our Sheat-Anchor, the Wind
<PB N="74" REF="49"> ea&s;ing; but the evening it came more out of the Bay. This day, as I was walking upon the Deck, came a Fox upon a &s;mall Hill over again&s;t the Ship, and &s;tood a while looking upon us; but &s;oon ran away, at a little noi&s;e we made.</P>
<P>The 24th, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> We had the Wind at S. E. in the morning, with a gentle Gale, but freezing extraordinary hard: Howbeit we got a Boat of Water, and cleared our Decks from Snow and Ice. At noon the Sun &s;hew'd it&s;elf upon our Ma&s;ts: I got my Fore-Top-Ma&s;t up, with my Mizen-Yard and Fore-Yard; and towards night the Wind South|erd. I then made a &s;trict Survey of all our Provi&s;ion, &s;hifting it out of one Cask into another, that I might be certain how much there was; and found but 154 pieces of Beef on board. I gave to each of our men a pound and a quarter of Honey, for the u&s;e &s;o often mentioned before. Some of them had been a&s;hore this afternoon, to get Dills and Periwinkles; but the weather was too cold to be endured, and they were forced to return aboard pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The 25th, <HI>Friday.</HI> By break of Day, the Wind being Ea&s;terly, I got all my Yards
<PB N="75" REF="49"> and Top-Ma&s;ts up, and the men went a&s;hore to ca&s;t off the Cable; with a full Re&s;olu|tion for Sea: But before they could clear the Ice, and come to ca&s;t it off, the Wind came to S. W. and W. S. W. beginning to blow and Snow. Before night I was forced to &s;trike both my Top-Ma&s;ts, and lower all down again &s;nug: and at 10 the Storm was &s;o furious, that our Men were contented to to abide here, notwith&s;tanding their late earne&s;tne&s;s to be going, acknowledging it a mercy from heaven to be detained.</P>
<P>The 26th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> The Wind was grown moderate by the Morning, and at noon 'twas quite Calm; we took two turns off our Haw&s;e: and in the afternoon got a Boat load of Wood: the Skiff too went a dragging, geting but 15 Scallops. This mild Day gave us opportunity to ob&s;erve, that the Sluces or Drains of Water, that fell into the Bay, were &s;o con&s;iderable, as to make a &s;mall motion toward the Sea at low Water.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, we had no River run|ning into this Harbour, or any which we call back-waters, but the fore-mentioned drains; all of them not being &s;ufficient to

<P>The 27th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> We had a &s;mall Snow falling all day, but &s;o very mild withal, that it melted as it fell, and that likewi&s;e that which laid before upon the Ship; and toward night it turned to rain wrth the Wind at S. W.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="50">
<P>The 28th, <HI>Monday.</HI> The morning was Stormy, the Wind at We&s;t, &s;o that I was nece&s;&s;itated to let go my Sheat-Anchor; but toward noon the Wind ea&s;ed, and I heaved it up again. I called all my Com|pany together, and told them, that the time had &s;pent &s;o much of our Provi&s;ion, that we could not venture to Sea, with what we had remaining, where we &s;hould be be|reaved of all the little comforts and helps we had from the Shore. And therefore while we had any thing left, we mu&s;t go and make &s;earch for people, whereby to get Provi&s;ion, to carry us out of this place, and to our much de&s;ired homes.</P>
<P>That &s;ince Almighty God had wonder|fully pre&s;erved us till this time, when the weather was grown more moderate, and the days of a brave length; we ought not only to expre&s;s our Thanks in words, to that Being of all Goodne&s;s, for our pre&s;ervation pa&s;t, but to be active and indu&s;trious for the future, &s;hewing our &s;elves thereby more rea|&s;onable Creatures.</P>
<P>And finding &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e to have &s;ome effect upon them, I ordered the Long-Boat to be immediately hoi&s;ed in and Cawked,
<PB N="78" REF="51"> and other things done, that might be for the &s;afety and conveniency of the men in her. It proved a fair day and thawed, whereby we got one &s;ide Graved in a few hours, fitted her Sails, and put many things in readine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 1&s;t, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> The month and day began with fair weather; and after we had made an end of trimming the Long-Boat and got her out, we went all hands a&s;hore, to get what we could for the Belly: and towards night got our Yards and Top-Ma&s;ts up, re&s;olving to keep in a moving po|&s;ture.</P>
<P>The 2d, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> It began to blow hard at W. S. W. and &s;o came to S. a violent Storm; in&s;omuch, that we were forced to &s;trike both Yards and Top-Ma&s;t down again: but towards night the Wind ea&s;ed, and it froze at an exce&s;&s;ive rate. This day the Sun &s;hined on board the Ship over the Hills; it being the fir&s;t time of my &s;eeing the &s;ame &s;ince I came in here, being 17 weeks. Note, that though the Sun at this time did not remain above the Horizon, quite &s;o long as it does in <HI>England,</HI> and its <HI>Meridian</HI> Altitude but little, yet their day was even as long, con&s;idering the more
<PB N="79" REF="51"> early day-break, and the more la&s;ting twilight in the evening. And who knows not, that upon the 10th of this Month, the days and nights are equal all the World over?</P>
<P>The 3d, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> It proved a very fair day, with much Sun-&s;hine and little Wind; we had not &s;een the like before in this place. This put &s;uch Life in our Men, that they got up our Top-Ma&s;ts at once, and loo&s;ed the Sails for drying them; they having con|tinued &s;till folded up now for &s;ome time; and according to our expectation they were found well: here being no fear of their get|ting heat to rot them. In the afternoon our Men went a&s;hore to get Dills and Periwin|kles, &s;ome dragged in the Long-Boat and got Scallops, and others in the Skiff with their Nets, made good purcha&s;e of Sea Eggs. When night came on, I could not but ob&s;erve our people as bu&s;y, as they are u&s;ually in a Cooks Shop about the <HI>Exchange</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> between the Hours of Twelve and Two: only with this difference, that every man was there both Gue&s;t and Ser|vant.

<PB N="86" REF="55"> thought I &s;aw &s;everal I&s;lands, but could not di&s;cern the bottom of the <HI>Fuel,</HI> which ran in very far and wide.</P>
<P>The 17th, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> It continued fair, and our Men went a&s;hore a Wooding, but had not been gone above two hours before they di&s;covered a Yaul coming towards the Ship; and according to the order given be|fore, we let 'em come aboard us very &s;ilently, expecting it was one of the Boats we &s;aw two days before. But it proved to be a Yaul that came from the North Cape, with four of our own men in her, and one <HI>Finlander;</HI> &s;ent by my Mate to &s;atisfie me, how things &s;tood there with the Long-Boat. And indeed it was high time to relea&s;e me from the fears I was in about them. He &s;ent in her a Barrel of Beef, a Barrel of Rye-Meal, 40 pound of Oatmeal, 80 pound of Stock-fi&s;h, with other Provi&s;ions of Fle&s;h, <HI>viz.</HI> Mutton, Pork, and Veni&s;on, all dryed; and a &s;mall Cask of Beer. They likewi&s;e brought us the news of a Peace concluded between <HI>England,</HI> the re&s;t of the Confede|rates, and <HI>France:</HI> and gave me the fol|lowing account of what hapened to them, from the time of their departure. <Q REND="margQuotes">After we had &s;ailed to the other &s;ide of the <HI>Fuel,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="55"> we got &s;ight of a little Yaul, and gave her chace, having the Wind of her, and it blowing fre&s;h. They made for the &s;hore, and ju&s;t as they landed we fell in with them. There were but three men in the Boat, who got out and run for it upon the Snow, two of which our men could in no wi&s;e overtake, but the other they caught: He was an old man, and they were his Sons. Our Crew treated him civilly, and having two <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> men born, in the Company, they fell to di&s;|cour&s;e him, and &s;oon &s;ettled a right under|&s;tanding between one another; that he im|mediately called the young men, that &s;tood a loof off to &s;ee what would become of their Father. They readily obeyed, and parlying with them altogether, our men offered them two Dollars, if they would conduct us to a Prie&s;ts Hou&s;e, or &s;ome Town, where we might get Provi&s;ion for Money or Goods. So they came to an agreement; the old man and one of his Sons forthwith &s;tepping into our Boat. But we having a brisk Gale, in towing the Yaul after us, pulled her Stem in pieces, and &s;o were forced to ca&s;t her off; the old man bidding his Son that was in her, to go a&s;hore, and directed us to keep on our
<PB N="88" REF="56"> way. This we did till we came to the outermo&s;t point, where we went a&s;hore, finding there &s;ome Hou&s;es, and about four Families; the Hamlet or Village being called by name of <HI>Swetwel.</HI> In this place we took up our Lodging all night, and the day following being &s;tormy, we dur&s;t not put to Sea. All this time we received kind entertainment from the In|habitants, and our Company likewi&s;e were as free of what they had to them. The day after being <HI>Sunday</HI> we parted from thence, and with all &s;peed made for the Town of <HI>Colwitch</HI> upon the Cape, where we arrived by two in the After|noon, the people being at Church. Af|ter Sermon they came all and made much of us, hearing our &s;tory, and admired that we were able to live on Board, in &s;o extraordinary hard Winter: for &s;o it was accounted with them. They &s;eemed very kind to us, till the Mini&s;ter and the Mer|chant fell out, about &s;elling our Pro|vi&s;ion. For one &s;aid it belonged to him, and the other as much; but between them both, we were furni&s;hed at their own rates, being glad to get it any way. It hap|pened at this time, there was one from the Governor of <HI>Ward-hou&s;e,</HI> who came to
<PB N="89" REF="56"> look after the Salvage of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Fly-boat, that was lo&s;t in the &s;ame Storm, that drove us in, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from him they had the good news of the Peace.</Q></P>
<P>That night I di&s;patched away the &s;ame Boat again (which was a Yaul belonging to &s;ome of the Town, of whom our peo|ple had hired it for four Dollars) and &s;ent her to the &s;ame place upon the Cape, with more Goods and Money for purcha&s;ing more Provi&s;ion; with order for my own Long-Boat to return on Board, with all con|venient &s;peed. Yet as I under&s;tood after|ward, they were in great danger of being lo&s;t; had not one of the Inhabitants coming along with them, and knowing the Coa&s;ts well, happily directed them to a place of &s;afety, during the Storm they met with.</P>
<P>The 18th, <HI>Friday.</HI> In the morning it blew a Storm at S. S. E. but towards noon it abated, yet Snowing much till 5 in the Af|ternon; becoming then fair and clear, with little Wind, and that &s;hifting to W. S. W.</P>
<P>The 19th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> We got a Boats loading of Wood, it continuing Calm, and
<PB N="90" REF="57"> fair till 5 in the Afternoon; from which time it Snowed till 8 at night: But all the while moderate as to Wind.</P>
<P>The 20th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> In the morning came a Yaul from the Mini&s;ters Hou&s;e, that lived fifteen miles from us, towards the North Kyne; and in her a Clerk or Secre|tary of the Governors, that re&s;ides at <HI>Ward|hou&s;e.</HI> This per&s;on was the &s;ame that our Men before had told me of, who came now on purpo&s;e to &s;ee me, after he had cro&s;&s;ed over the <HI>Fuel,</HI> to make his return; his way being then all over Land, and that upon the Snow. He told me, that he boggled nei|ther at Mountain or Valley, but could go in 14 hours time 16 <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Miles, which make 64 of ours. And accordingly &s;hewed me how he was fitted for &s;uch a Journey, having with him a Leathern Canoa, in the fa&s;hion of a Weavers Shuttle, only turned up more at the ends. This was carried in his Boat, when he went by Water, but at Land it &s;erved as a Sledge does in <HI>Holland</HI> when the Rivers are frozen; having 3 Iron Keels at the bottom, and being drawn by a Rain Deer. It had a co|vering like a Deck, with a hole in the mid|dle, coming clo&s;e about his wa&s;te: So that
<PB N="91" REF="57"> with a Furr Coat over the upper part of his Body, and other Cloathing beneath, he was well provided again&s;t the wor&s;t of wea|ther. In his hand he carried a Paddle, or &s;mall Oar to keep him from overturning. In the way are no Inns, but he makes his nights Lodging at &s;ome Mini&s;ters Hou&s;e, where he &s;till finds free quarter.</P>
<P>He informed me of two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that were forced into the Harbour of <HI>Ward-hou&s;e,</HI> by the &s;ame Storm that forced me in, where I then lay: that he &s;uppo&s;ed they were now going to Sea; their men having laid on board in order thereto 3 days before he came from thence. I thought that might very well be, con&s;idering the great advantage they had of me, being at the principal Town of the whole Country, even where the Governor him&s;elf lived; where they could want for little, but had good <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Hou&s;es, with Stoves in them, to keep them warm. And one thing this Gentle|man told me, too con&s;iderable to omit; namely, That from <HI>Ward-hou&s;e</HI> afore&s;aid, there went a Po&s;t to <HI>Copenhagen</HI> every fort|night. So that if any Ship be forc't in there or thereabouts by &s;tre&s;s of weather, find|ing a Mini&s;ters Hou&s;e, they may &s;end to
<PB N="92" REF="58"> the Town, and from thence to any part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In this Boat came the Mini&s;ters Son, who brought both dry and new Fi&s;h, and pretty &s;tore; with &s;everal pre&s;ents from his Fa|ther, as a Calf new killed, with Chee&s;e and Milk for my Men: al&s;o dryed Mutton, and Hams of Bacon, Veni&s;on and Par|tridge.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, <HI>Monday.</HI> It blew fre&s;h at S all day; notwith&s;tanding there came a <HI>Finni&s;h</HI> Boat on board me, and brought me &s;tore of Fi&s;h and dryed Mutton, with a &s;mall parcel of fre&s;h Butter and Chee&s;e. I bought all they had but &s;ome Veni&s;on and Partridge, which at their going away they pre&s;ented me with; I giving them in gra|tuity &s;uch as I had; <HI>viz.</HI> a few Rai&s;ins, (a great rarity with them,) and &s;ome Mead. Their Veni&s;on was lean and horridly black, but the Partridges were dainty, being fre&s;h killed and fat.</P>
<P>The 22d, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> It proved a Storm; the Wind all Southerly, withal freezing ex|ceeding hard; but dry over head.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="58">
<P>The 23d, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> It was &s;o fair and calm, that we cleared our Haw&s;e. This day came another Boat on board, and brought us Fi&s;h of &s;everal kinds, both dry and wet, <HI>viz.</HI> Cod, Ling, and Turbut; &s;ome Butter and Chee&s;e, with dry'd Fle&s;h of the &s;orts afore&s;aid. <HI>Note,</HI> that this Meat was not &s;alted, but prepared thus for keeping, by being hung up in their Chimneys. It had little of goodne&s;s or nouri&s;hment, and &s;carce appeared to &s;well by boyling. But I took all they had, in truck for Cloath, and Cloaths made up; and &s;ome I bought with Money. The Boat they came in, was of the fa&s;hion of a <HI>Norway</HI>-Yaul, big enough for &s;ix Rowers, and &s;o many they had: but &s;ome others had but four, being le&s;s; and like|wi&s;e there were for two only. The people are low of &s;tature, of Limbs well &s;et, fre&s;h colour'd in the Face, though of a dirty hue, and an ill &s;mell attending them. But whether it is from their lying in their Cloaths, or their natural &s;avour, perhaps derived from their con&s;tant Diet upon Fi&s;h, I could not determine with my &s;elf. Their hair is generally light coloured and lank, cut like the <HI>Danes:</HI> They wear their Beards of a full growth, young and old: Their Ha|bit
<PB N="94" REF="59"> too is like the <HI>Norwegians, viz.</HI> Clo&s;e Breeches, &s;hort Coats, both made of cour&s;e Cloath, with Caps of the &s;ame furred. Their Shoes are pulled up half way on their Legs like Boots, with Toes turning up like the tip of a Half Moon painted, and furred within. One thing peculiar in this peoples Garb I ob&s;erved, and that was, they every one carried a &s;mall Powder-Horn, hanging under their Chins, by a &s;tring about their Necks. For what u&s;e or purpo&s;e I could not learn, tho I asked them as well as I could, but could not explain their An&s;wers; for my <HI>Dane</HI> that remained on board, was then as I thought, almo&s;t at the point of death; that is, &s;o weak, as not to do the work of an Interpreter. The Governour's man too, could not &s;peak <HI>Dutch</HI> enough to be intelligible to me, when I enquired into the &s;ame thing three days before, though I under&s;tood he was a <HI>German</HI> born.</P>
<P>The 24th, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> It proved fair, the Wind at South We&s;t; we got a Boat of Wood. Toward night it we&s;ter'd, and a|bout 8 our Long-Boat returned on board, and brought with them a Barrel of Beef, a Barrel of Rye-Meal, and 3 hundred weight
<PB N="95" REF="59"> of Stock-fi&s;h, with other Provi&s;ions which we wanted; namely, &s;ome dry'd Mutton and Pork, and &s;ome Bread al&s;o, with But|ter and Chee&s;e, to our great comfort; we being therewith &s;ufficiently &s;tored for the Sea. And from them I took this following re|lation; That the Town of <HI>Colwitch</HI> and the Cape con&s;i&s;ted of about 14 Hou&s;es, with as many Families, and one Church. The Hou&s;es are built after the <HI>Norway</HI> fa&s;hion, of Wood, with Stoves placed in the mid|dle, or &s;o as to warm the Rooms, without the &s;ight of Fire; they being a kind of Ovens, and are heated after the &s;ame man|ner. Their Hou&s;es have Windows of Gla&s;s, but with Wooden Shutters, both in|ward and outward, which they make clo&s;e in the Winter, by &s;topping or caulking them with Mo&s;s. So they keep up &s;everal weeks, in the dark and cold &s;ea&s;on, burning great Tallow Candles continually; &s;ome of which our men &s;aw. The Church was of the &s;ame materials with their Hou&s;es, being one Room, able to contain about thirty per&s;ons. Four or five of the&s;e Churches or Chappels are &s;erved by one Teacher about three times in the year; (for it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed they only Congregate in the Summer.) They are u&s;ually placed
<PB N="96" REF="60"> about five or &s;ix miles off each other, or nearer, according as the Country is more or le&s;s populous. But one Pa&s;tor lives ge|nerally fifteen miles from another, who is maintained by every tenth Fi&s;h; and where he re&s;ides not, he empowers one to gather the Tithe as they take them. By this means they are furni&s;hed with Merchandize, which they &s;ell, or exchange for other things they want, with Ships that come yearly to their Port Town to fetch them, and bring goods accordingly. Hence they come to be the mo&s;t wealthy and con&s;iderable of the peo|ple. They are Lawyers, Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and cu&s;tomarily &s;ole in Authori|ty. For their Education is the mo&s;t liberal, being, as I was informed, in a School, or petty Univer&s;ity in <HI>Norway,</HI> near <HI>Dronthem.</HI> They too ob&s;erve the greate&s;t Ho&s;pitality; all Travellers being entertained by them, and furni&s;hed with Sleds or Rain-Deer, from one to another: the like al&s;o was I told by the Governour's Man before, when he informed me, of their way of Travelling. They breed Cattle of a &s;mall kind, with Goats and Sheep; and Swine al&s;o. The former are fed in the Summer with Gra&s;s, of which they have plenty at that time; but in the Winter they gather Rock-weeds

All this time the Wind continued &s;hifting between S. W. by S. and We&s;t. I made my way N. W. 3d. We&s;t: di&s;tance 47 miles</P>
<P>The 29th, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> We had moderate weather as to Wind, and that &s;hifting be|tween South, and S. W. by We&s;t. I made my way this 24 hours N. N. W. di&s;tance 47 miles. It being almo&s;t &s;tark Calm between times.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="63">
<P>The 30th, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> It blew a Stou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Wind till 5 in the morning, when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> began to abate, and fell a Snowing, and freezing very hard withal: I tacked to the Southward. By twelve at noon it grew Calm. I made my way this 24 hours W. by N. half Northerly: di&s;tance 68 Miles This day I got an ob&s;ervation, and foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> my &s;elf to be in the latitude of 73 degrees, and 25 minutes.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> It proved very fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> weather, but very cold, the Wind holding between the S. by We&s;t and S. E. with a moderate Gale; and towards Noon we had it mighty Calm, with a &s;mooth Sea. I made my way S. W. half We&s;t: di&s;tance 67 Miles.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> the 1&s;t, <HI>Friday.</HI> It blew hard, the Wind &s;hifting between the S. S. E. and We&s;t; the Sea going very high. I made my way W. S. W. 3 d. We&s;t: di&s;tance 57 Miles.</P>
<P>The 2d, <HI>Saturday.</HI> It continued to blow as the day before, Snowing at an ex|ce&s;&s;ive rate, and froze &s;o exceeding hard,
<PB N="103" REF="63"> that all the water that flew into the Ship, became Ice in a &s;mall time. In&s;omuch, that the Ship it &s;elf, both within and without, was compleatly lined and covered with Ice: and nothing about us was fit to be handled. The Wind came to the North; &s;o we made &s;hift to get our Main-Sail hauled up, and bound together, as well as we could, and &s;tood away with our Fore-Sail; it look|ing dreadfully a-&s;tern of us. But toward noon the face of things was altered, and I got another Ob&s;ervation, finding my &s;elf thereby in the Latitude of 71 degrees and 46 minutes.</P>
<P>Then we &s;et our Main-Sail again, but there was no &s;preading it, it was &s;o hard frozen; and to pull it down we were forced to bring the Tackle to our Tacks and Sheats, &s;training them as hard as we dur&s;t, for fear of pulling the Sail in pieces: after all, we could not get it above half &s;pread. We &s;et our Sprit-Sail too, but all the Watch, which were ten Men, were two hours in getting it loo&s;e. In the afternoon I went a|bout &s;etting my Fore-Top-Sail; but could not get it out of the Top, by all the ways we could devi&s;e. I made my way S. W. 3 d. We&s;t: di&s;tances 35 Miles.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="64">
<P>The 3d, <HI>Sunday.</HI> It was moderate e|nough as to Wind, and that between the N. and Ea&s;t; but it froze exce&s;&s;ively. This day with great toil and labour, I got both my Top-Sails &s;et; loo&s;ing the Sails by degrees, and letting them dry; and bringing the Sheats to the Windles, with Looff-Tackles, I got them &s;pread. I made my way S. W. by S. di&s;tance 73 miles.</P>
<P>The 4th, <HI>Monday.</HI> We had mild wea|ther this day, the Wind &s;hifting round; and now and then it Snowed. I made my way W. S. W. 1 d. We&s;t: di&s;tance 54 Miles.</P>
<P>The 5th, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> The Wind came to to South, and &s;o to We&s;t, blowing hard, that we were forced to take in our Top-Sails, and at la&s;t our Fore-Sail. At ten in the forenoon we Reefed our Fore-Sail and Mizen, and tacked to the Southward, &s;o that I made my way W. by N. di&s;tance but 34 Miles.</P>
<P>The 6th, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> Little Wind had we all this day, and that running round the Compa&s;s; but the Fro&s;t fixt and &s;e|vere.
<PB N="105" REF="64"> The way I made was S. S. E. 1 d. Ea&s;t; di&s;tance but 19 miles.</P>
<P>The 7th, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> Not much Wind to day, but &s;hifting between the South and W. S. W. with clo&s;e weather. Notwith|&s;tanding I made my way S. by Ea&s;t: di&s;tance 22 Miles.</P>
<P>The 8th, <HI>Friday.</HI> The former part of the day it blew very hard, obliging us to hand both our Top-Sails; but in the after-part proved &s;o moderate, that we &s;et them again: the Wind &s;hifting from S. to S. W. by S. we made our way We&s;t, half Southerly: di&s;tance 63 Miles.</P>
<P>The 9th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> It proved Squauly, but indifferent as to Wind. We handed our Fore-Top-Sail twice, and &s;et him again as otf. The Wind &s;hifting between S. and S. W. I held my cour&s;e for 51 Miles We&s;t, half Southerly.</P>
<P>The 10th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> We met with hard Gales, fir&s;t at South, and then coming to We&s;t: which put us under a Main cour&s;e. I held on my way S. W. 5 d. Southerly: di|&s;tance 65 Miles.</P>
<PB N="106" REF="65">
<P>The 11th, <HI>Monday.</HI> It remained &s;tormy weather, attended with abundance of Snow falling, and exceeding hard Fro&s;t. I was forced to Reef my Main-Sail as well as we could, but in a &s;orry manner, &s;tub|born as it was, and &s;o much Snow lodged in it. The Wind was at S. E; &s;o I made my way We&s;t 42 Miles.</P>
<P>The 12th, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> The Wind came to E. S. E. and &s;o about to N. by W. with a great deal of Snow, and freezing extraordi|nary hard. I made my way good to the South 92 miles.</P>
<P>The 13th, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> Good weather enough as to Wind, but the Snow fell very thick. At Midnight it blew from the N. W. towards day from the E. and by S. little Wind. At break of day it fell quite Calm, freezing very hard. I made my way South; di&s;tance 94 miles.</P>
<P>The 14th, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> The Wind came to N. E. and then to North W. blowing &s;o very hard, that I could carry nothing, but a Fore-Cour&s;e: we had a great Sea out of the South; but in the morning I &s;et my Main-Sail again, after the be&s;t manner I
<PB N="107" REF="65"> could: &s;o hard frozen was it, that I could not get it above half &s;pread, though I lower'd my Main-Yard above 3 foot down. I made my way South: di&s;tance 117 Miles.</P>
<P>The 15th, <HI>Friday.</HI> We had a Brave Wind from the W. and by N. which made us &s;trive hard to bring our Fore-Top-Sail to be &s;erviceable, getting it off the top, and by meer &s;trength forced open &s;ome part of it; and &s;o &s;tood away with it for four hours: after which time it relented, enlarged and became more u&s;eful. By which means I made my way S. di&s;tance 123 Miles.</P>
<P>The 16th, <HI>Saturday.</HI> It blew a &s;tout of Wind at N. N. W. &s;o that I had made my way S. by W; di&s;tance 142 Miles. By twelve at noon we &s;aw <HI>Fowley I&s;land,</HI> to the E. S. E. of us, di&s;tant eighteen Miles. We had brave moderate weather at this Time; and now we heard Rats about the Ship, who began to be Infen&s;e and Vexatious to us, in &s;eizing upon our new Stock-fi&s;h. It is manife&s;t they kept clo&s;e all the cold &s;ea|&s;on, but our &s;ick Men who lay below with my Surgeon and Carpenter, (who was an old Man and kept con&s;tantly a Lamp burning
<PB N="108" REF="66"> by him,) never &s;aw any of them, or per|ceived them in the lea&s;t to &s;tir. How they lived &s;o long on Board we gue&s;&s;ed afterward, when we found they had eaten holes in our Ma&s;ts, and made them&s;elves places to lye in. And for drink they could get none, but by licking the Ice Casks; though no body &s;aw &s;uch a thing done by them.</P>
<P>The 17th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> It continued fair the Wind at We&s;t. At Sun Ri&s;ing I &s;aw <HI>Shet|land,</HI> and the I&s;les of <HI>Fair</HI> and <HI>Fowley</HI> alto|gether; it being very clear &s;o early. At ten I di&s;cerned <HI>Orkney;</HI> and at twelve at noon I took my departure from <HI>Fair I&s;le,</HI> which then bore North from us, di|&s;tant thirty Miles; being very fair wea|ther.</P>
<P>The 18th, <HI>Monday,</HI> The weather held as before, but the Wind was &s;hifting be|tween the W. and S. W. I made my way S. S. E. di&s;tance 82 Miles.</P>
<P>The 19th, <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> The day began with a fre&s;h of Wind at W. N. W. and a little before noon we &s;aw 3 Ships &s;teering towards us. Whereupon, as not depending upon what the Governor of <HI>Wardhou&s;e</HI> his
<PB N="109" REF="66"> Secretary had told us, or giving entire cre|dit of his news of a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> I cau&s;ed a clear Ship to be made, and put our &s;elves in as good a po&s;ture of defence as we were able.</P>
<P>I furled my &s;mall Sails and Main-Sail, and by that time one of them came within &s;hot of my weather Bow, I fired a &s;hot for him to come Leeward of me; which he very hone&s;tly did, and confirmed the news of a Peace, to the great joy of our Hearts: for God knows we were but in a bad condition for managing our Guns in a way of fighting. This Ship was a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Fly-boat bound to <HI>Greenland,</HI> for Whale-fi&s;hing. We pre&s;ent|ly after &s;aw more Ships bound to the &s;ame place, and two Fi&s;her-boats al&s;o: But be|ing now out of fear for Ships, we took no notice of the re&s;t. I made my way this 24 hours S. half We&s;t di&s;tance 113 Miles.</P>
<P>The 20th, <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> The Wind turned to the S. W. by W. &s;o that I could not Seas in with our North Cour&s;e, but was forced to &s;tretch it away to the South|ward.</P>
<PB N="110" REF="67">
<P>The 21&s;t, <HI>Thur&s;day.</HI> The Wind re|turned to the N. N. E. and to the N. E. At 4 in the afternoon we had the &s;ight of <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> to the S. and by E. off us. And no &s;mall &s;urprize was it to us, to &s;ee all the Land covered with Snow at this time of the year. A pro&s;pect of ones own Country had been agreeable no doubt to any of us after &s;o long an ab&s;ence by con&s;traint and misfortune; but much more, had &s;he had the u&s;ual garb of the &s;ea&s;on. Soon after the wind came to the Ea&s;t, and obliged me to tack to the Norward in the night; we had much Snow and a fre&s;h Gale, &s;hifting N. E. and by N. and Ea&s;t North Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The 22d, <HI>Friday.</HI> In the Morning with a North N. E. wind, I came into <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, and thanks be to God, gave my Owners a &s;ight of their Ship: one of them, as I was told, but 3 hours before, having proffer'd his part for 3 Guineas, which was now worth 150 pounds.</P>
<P>The Wind holding in the &s;ame point, and a fair Tide with me, I made no &s;top, but put through the Road, and ran
<PB N="111" REF="67"> that night into <HI>Alborough</HI> Bay; where the Wind coming We&s;terly, brought me to an Anchor, &s;o I Rid all night.</P>
<P>The 23d, <HI>Saturday.</HI> By day-light per|ceiving &s;ome Colliers coming out of the <HI>Ne&s;&s;e,</HI> I hoi&s;ted out my Long-Boat, and got &s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ion among them; to our great Comfort. That afternoon I got out of <HI>Sled</HI> way; the Wind &s;till at We&s;t.</P>
<P>The 24th, <HI>Sunday.</HI> The Wind coming to the N. W. I got up to the Buoy off the Middle of <HI>Lee.</HI> It was calm and very warm, which brought our men into many Com|plaints, as pain in their Limbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the next day I thought fit to &s;end two of them up the River. I took notice of one of our Company, that went well to his Cabbin, but when we called him out to heave up the Anchor, he was &s;o &s;woln, that we feared he would bur&s;t. But then being got above <HI>Grave&s;|end,</HI> I hired a Wherry, and &s;ent him up with three more; &s;upplying their places with &s;ome fre&s;h and able men to bring up the Ship.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="68">
<P>I and all the re&s;t, perceived our &s;elves manife&s;tly the wor&s;e for the warm weather, as we called it; but 'tis well enough known almo&s;t to every one living, that &s;uch a Temper of Air in <HI>England,</HI> both then, and for &s;ome time after, was &s;carce ever ob|&s;erved, when the year was &s;o far advanced.</P>
