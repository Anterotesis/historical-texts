<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAving already endeavoured to Inform my Countrey|men of the Grandeur of the <HI>English</HI> Monarchy, by giving them an Account of the Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and likewise of his Majestys Dominions in <HI>America;</HI> the acceptance they met with, hath incouraged me to discover to them what many have only heard of by discourse, namely the <HI>English</HI> Acquisi|tions in the 2 other Quarters of the <HI>VVorld, Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> In the first, the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company being by their Charter from King <HI>Charles 2d.</HI> dated <HI>January, 2. 1662.</HI> Incorporated, the Limits of their Trade were from <HI>Sally</HI> in South <HI>Barbary,</HI> to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> In which large Tract of Land, they have Erected several Forts, Factories and Settlements for securing their Commerce, which is very considera|ble in those Parts. In <HI>Asia</HI> the <HI>English</HI> began their Discoveries just an hundred years since, in 1600. under Sr. <HI>James Lancaster</HI> with 4 Ships only. And soon after, the Industry of others had such success, that the Merchants Trading thither were likewise Incorporated by Charter. This Honourable <HI>East-India</HI> Company, by the prudent management of their affairs, setled Forts and Factorys in Twenty four several noted Places, Of which our unkind Neighbours deprived us of some, and others were Deserted for Conveniency; the names of those abandoned are as follows. <HI>Ormus</HI> and <HI>Jasques</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf. <HI>Cambaja</HI> and <HI>Agra</HI> in the Great <HI>Mogols Countrey. Armagon, Pattana,</HI> and <HI>Siatu</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Coromandell,</HI> and Continent of <HI>Asia, Ticko, Jambo, Prianan</HI> on the Isle of <HI>Sumatra. Ban|tam,</HI>

So that now the <HI>English</HI> possess only those mentioned in the Title Page, the Ac|count of all those Places with the Religion, Government and Manners of the Inhabitants, and the Strange Crea|tures therein cannot but be diverting, I have also given a brief Description of the Isle of <HI>St. Helena,</HI> and the wonderful Voyage from thence, of <HI>Don Domingo Gon|sales</HI> the Little <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which ingenious and well con|trived Fancy would have been lost if not here retreived. These with many other pleasant Relations therein, will I hope procure as fair Quarter for this as those for|merly published have met with, from the Friends of</P>

<HEAD>The Acquisitions of the Royal <HI>African</HI> Com|pany in <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the several Forts and Castles belonging to them, from <HI>Sally</HI> in South <HI>Barbary</HI> to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> in <HI>Africa.</HI> With an account of the Natives of those Countrys; their Religion, Government, Trade, Wars, Marriages, Funerals, and Strange Customs. Also the Birds, Beasts, Monsters, Serpents <HI>&amp;c.</HI> found there. Intermixt with divers Acci|dents, and Notable Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>THat Tract of Land called <HI>Guinea,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> comprehends 700 Leagues from <HI>Cape Verd</HI> in 14 Degrees N. La|titude, to Cape <HI>Consalvo</HI> in the first Degree of South. Latitude, The <HI>Por|tugals</HI> were the first that ranged this Shore, and having Intelligence of the Commodities, and manner of Trading, the Natives by fair means and force got footing on the Sea-coasts, building Forts and placing Garrisons and Factories in seve|ral places, and found such a Golden Trade, that they called some Coasts thereof by that name. This was an inducement (as what will not Gold attract) to their further search all along to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and thereby consequently to the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> The fair quarter, and usage, the Inhabitants received from the <HI>Portugals</HI> already setled there, incouraged them to exchange their Commodities, which Trade according to the Custom of that Kingdom was maintained by
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Factors, upon the King of <HI>Portugals</HI> particular ac|count in every Port and Town, as if he intended the profits of Merchandizing should defray the charges of his Conquests and Garrisons; furnishing the Natives with Salt, Iron, Tin, Copper, Basons, Knives, Cloth, Linnen, and other <HI>European</HI> Goods, and receiving in exchange, Cattle, Corn, Rice, and the like, but chiefly Gold in great abundance, both in Sand and melted Ingots, which gave Life and Briskness to the further Discovery of those Countreys, and continuance of that Trade to this day, though not so considerable as formerly.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> and other Nations, desirous to share in this Rich Trade, in short time Sailed thither, and because they had no Forts to Protect their Persons and Goods from the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and treache|ry of the Inhabitants, they were compelled to Anchor along the Coasts near the greatest Towns, and signifying to the <HI>Negroes</HI> what Wares they had brought, by their plausible demeanor, they at length imboldened them to come aboard their Ships, and bring their Gold; the manner of which Trade was very different from that of any other Countrey; For betimes in the Morning, the wind being then generally off the Shore, and the wea|ther calm, the Natives came aboard in their Canoes and Scu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">es to Traffique some for themselves, and some as Factors for others, carrying at their Girdles a Purse, wherein were several small Clouts or Papers, containing the Gold belonging sometimes to ten several Men, which though all of the same weight and goodness, yet they readily distinguisht, and having made their bargains for Cloth, Linnen, or the like, at Noon they return'd with the Seabrize again to the Shore; and beside the agreement, these Factors had some small thing for themselves, in reward for their Brokage, but in process of time, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> frequenting these Coasts, and being well acquainted with the manner of the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Traffique, and coming into the same places where the <HI>English</HI> Traded and were known, they soon spoiled this Golden Trade, by their sinister and indirect dealing; for Anchoring with the <HI>English,</HI> whom they found to have a better Trade than themselves, they secretly bribed those Factors to carry their Passengers and Merchants aboard their own Ships, and not the <HI>English;</HI> obliging them to Trade only with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> Which Craft the <HI>En|glish</HI> perceiving, used the same Arts to ingage the Factors to themselves, so that out-vying each other, these Brokers commonly gained to themselves six or seven <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the vast prejudice of all Trade upon these Coasts, since this ill Custom must be kept up by all Succeeding <HI>European</HI> Merchants;</P>
<P>It was observed that many <HI>Negro</HI> Merchants who dwelt up in the Countrey coming to buy Wares of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with great quantities of Gold, and divers Slaves, thirty or more according to their Quality, to carry back the Goods they should pur|chase, and taking their Lodgings in the Houses of these Brokers, whom they acquainted with their full Commissions and Intentions, and to whom they delivered their Gold; these Factors would go aboard the <HI>Flemish</HI> Ships with them to Trade and Barter, and if the <HI>Negro</HI> Merchants were not skilled in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Tongue, these Brokers would bid the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not to speak the <HI>Morisco</HI> Language to them, because they Inhabited far within the Land, thereby giving the <HI>Dutch</HI> the watch-word, that they meant to deceive their Countreymen, and after|ward divide the Spoil, so that the knavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h Factor connived at the extravagant prizes of the <HI>Holland|ers,</HI> to draw the more Gold from the Merchant, whom he likewise cheated, sometimes by putting some of his Gold into his Mouth, Ears or other|wise, which the Merchant <HI>Negro</HI> finding wanting in the Scale, adds to the Cheat himself by blowing into the Christians Ballance to make it weight;
<PB N="4" REF="5">
The bargain being finished, and the <HI>Negro</HI> again landed, the Factor returns back to the Ship, to share his ill got gains with the <HI>Flemings;</HI> This way of proceeding was very detrimental to the <HI>English,</HI> and other Christians Trading on these Coasts, so that unless they connive with these Factors, their Voyage will be lost, and their Goods unsold.</P>
<P>In 1553. <HI>Thomas Windam,</HI> and <HI>Anthony Pintado</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> in two <HI>English</HI> Ships Traded along these Coasts as far as <HI>Benin,</HI> where they presented them|selves to the King who sate in a great Hall, the Walls whereof were made of Earth without Win|dows, the Roof of thin Boards, open in divers places; his Nobles never look him in the Face, but sit with their Buttocks on the ground, and their hands before their Faces, not looking up till the King commands them; when they depart they go backward, turning their Faces still toward him. The next year Captain <HI>Iohn Lock</HI> Sailed into these Parts to Trade for Gold and Elephants Teeth; And after him Captain <HI>Towerson</HI> made several Voy|ages thither, who at the River of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> obser|ved a kind of Pease growing on the Shore like Trees, with stalks twenty seven paces long; At Cape <HI>Tres Puntas,</HI> they made him Swear by the Water of the Sea, that he would not hurt them, before they would Trade with him; <HI>Aban</HI> a <HI>Negro</HI> King treated them kindly with a Pot of Palm or Coco-Wine, which they draw out of Trees.</P>
<P>The People are handsom and well proportioned, having nothing disagreeable in their Countenances, but the blackness of their Complexion, some of them have flattish Noses, all little Ears, the Peo|ple go all Naked till they are married, and then are clothed from the middle to the knees; At the Marriage of their Daughters, they give half an Ounce of Gold to buy Wine for the Wedding; the Bride in the presence of her Friends swears to be true to her Husband, which the man doth not; who
<PB N="5" REF="5">
have as many Wives as they can maintain, yet the first has this preheminence, so that he can never take another but by her permission, but because the multitude of Wives and Children are counted the greatest honour and riches in that Countrey, they often perswade their Husbands to take more, and glory therein; the first Wife likewise has the privi|ledge to lye with her Husband three Nights suc|cessively, whilst the rest must be content only with one, so that they live very quietly together. A Merchant or Captain will have thirty or forty; the King of <HI>Benin</HI> had six hundred, wherewith he went in Solemn Procession every year; The King of <HI>Fetu</HI>'s Son had fourteen Sons and twelve Daughters, and kept an hundred Slaves to wait upon them; At <HI>Cape Gonsalvo</HI> they pink and colour their bodies, and offer their Wives to Strangers; The King uses his own Daughters when grown up as Wives, and the Queens with the like incestuous abomination make use of their own Sons.</P>
<P>Their Women are unfaithful Discoverers of Na|tures hidden secrets, not being ashamed to be de|livered publickly in the sight of Men, Boys and Girls. They circumcise both Sexes; after Travel they accompany not their Husbands in three months; As soon as she is delivered they give her a drink made of Rice, Mays, Water, Wine, and <HI>Mallaguett</HI> like our Pepper, after which she lyes warm three or four hours, and then rises, washes her self and Child, and so falls to her work as be|fore; Next they give it a name, usually of some Christian they are obliged to, then wrapping it in a kind of Blanket or Skin, they lay it upon Rush|es where it continues above five weeks, then the Mother tyes it to a board and carries it on her back with the Legs under her arm-pits, and the hands tyed about her neck, where it hangs all day, and never comes off till it goes to bed, and yet few or none prove lame or deformed, notwithstanding
<PB N="6" REF="6">
the shaking of their bodies; they give them the breast over their shoulders, and this may be the reason of the flatness of their Noses by their knock|ing them continually against the Back and Shoul|ders of the Mother while she is walking or at work; for it is observed that the Children of their Gentry whose Mothers do not labour, nor carry their In|fants about them, have very comely Noses; they wash and rub their Children every Morning with Oil of Palms.</P>
<P>When they are seven or eight years old, they hang a Net about their Necks, made of the Bark of a Tree, full of <HI>Fetiches</HI> or little Gods to secure them from the Devil, who they believe would else carry them away; They hang their Hair full of Shells, and Coral about the Arms and Legs, with several <HI>Feticho's</HI> of different qualities; one being an Antidote against Vomiting, a second against dangerous Falls, a third prevents Bleeding, a fourth causes Sleep, a fifth secures them against Wild Beasts, and the like, giving to each <HI>Fetisso</HI> a different name: They soon learn to speak, go, and swim: When they are born, they are not black, but red: About seven year old they learn to spin Thred, make Nets, and go a Fishing with their Fathers, and feed as they do, picking up any nasty thing in the Streets, which they eat with good Appetites: The Boys and Girls are all naked, which makes them have no sense of shame or mo|desty, they being neither reproved nor corrected by their Parents: They are excellent at Swimming, even at this Age, so that if their Canoe overset at Sea, ther are very little concerned, all of them swimming back again to the place from whence they came, and consequently they can Dive with great dexterity and fetch up any thing from the bottom: About twelve their Fathers instruct them how to make a Canoe, and catch Fish; The Mer|chants bring their Sons acquainted with <HI>Europeans,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
and with the Mystery of Trade: At eighteen they begin to set up for themselves, two or three toge|ther hiring a House and purchasing a Canoe; they then cover their Nudities, grow amorous, and their Fathers look out Wives for them: The Girls clean the Houses, pick the Rice, beat the Mays, make the Bread, clean the Kitchen, buy and sell at Mar|ket, make Baskets of Rushes and Matts which they weave extream curiously, but their chief care is to provide Meat and Drink for their Parents, secure their Goods, and all other kinds of good Huswifry; when grown up, they are very lascivious, and boast of their Gallantries, especially with Strangers, whom they seem to affect above their own Men: They are very careful to keep their Teeth white, have Wit enough, but are very wanton with the Young Fellows stark naked, to please whom they wash, comb, and plait their hair with great curi|osity; some paint their Foreheads and Eyebrows red and white, and hang Pendants in their Ears; all love Ribbons especially red, they have Neckla|ces of Coral, and Bracelets upon their Wrists, Arms and Legs, when they go abroad they weare a piece of Silk, Taffaty or other Stuff wrapt about from the breast to the midleg, and have always a great bunch of Keys, though never a Coffer nor Trunk to open; the Virgins make it their whole business to appear acceptable especially to white men, and are seldom barren before, though not very fruitful after Marriage.</P>
<P>For many years the <HI>English</HI> frequenting these Coasts, made little benefit thereby; for the Inhabi|tants, perceiving their Gold so earnestly desired by all Nations, set such a rate thereon, and having been often beguiled, they grew more wary in their bargaining, and to the measure and goodness of their Commodities, and though at first they knew no distinction of Christians, but thought the <HI>Por|tugals,</HI> and all other white men to be of the same
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Nation, yet they have since learned the particular manners and dealing of each Countrey, and have found the fairest Trade from the <HI>English,</HI> who are therefore most welcome to them, and speed best of any other Nation; Especially since the Traders into these parts were Incorporated, by their Char|ter dated <HI>Ian.</HI> 20. 1662. and intituled. <HI>The Com|pany of Royal Adventurers</HI> of <HI>England</HI> Trading into <HI>Africa,</HI> or the <HI>Guinea Company;</HI> The Limits of their Trade, being from <HI>Sally</HI> in South <HI>Barbary,</HI> to <HI>Cape de bona Esperanza,</HI> or the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> within which Limits all <HI>English</HI> Ships are prohibited to Trade unless Authorized by them.

<HEAD>I. <HI>Iames</HI> Fort.</HEAD>
<P>THis Fort was formerly secured with eight Pei|ces of Cannon, but was demolished by the <HI>French</HI> in the late War. It is now rebuilding much stronger, and designed to have ninety Guns, and a Garrison of Two Hundred and Fifty <HI>Europeans</HI> besides Negro's and Mulatto's. The Government of this Place is reckoned worth about Two Thousand pound a year. It is Scituate near <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> so called from its continual greenness, which makes it a delectable place, being a Promontory, which throws it self into the Sea, covered with green Trees, and causing a beautiful Prospect by reason of their evenness, seeming as if planted by a line; the Natives, have generally small Bellies, long Legs, broad Feet, long Toes, sharp Sight, quick Wits, are Envious, curiously Neat, Thieves, Letcherous, subject to the Pox, of which as well as their <HI>Puden|da</HI> they are not the least ashamed, yet hold break|ing wind backward a great incivility, and wondred at the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for offering them such contempt. They have Stomachs like Estridges, as appears by their strange and usual repasts; when they go to Market, they wash from Head to Foot, and put on other Cloths; They buy only for one day; Their Bread is made by stamping their Millet as we do Spice in a woodden dish, steeping it over night with a little Maiz, and in the morning laying it on a stone, they grind it with another stone, as Painters do their Colours, till it be dough, which they then temper with fresh Water and Salt, and
<PB N="10" REF="8">
make Rolls thereof twice so big as a mans Fist baking them a little on the Hearth, and then eat, them. Their Viands are raw flesh, handfuls of Corn, large draughts of <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> Dogs, Catts, Buffles, Elephants, though stinking like Carrion, and a thousand Magots crawling on them; They have little Birds like Bullfinches which hang their Nests on the small ends of branches of Trees for fear of Snakes, these they eat alive Feathers and all; The <HI>Negro's</HI> say that up in the Countrey, they eat dried Snakes, and the guts of Dogs raw, which our Author hath seen, and a Boy who was left on Ship|board in pawn for Money, would privately kill the Hens, that he might eat the raw Guts; They likewise eat raw stinking Fish dried in the Sun, yet can dispence with dainties when they have them; They make a kind of Ale of Mays and Water boyl'd together, and putting it into a Ves|sel as large as a Kilderkin, four or five place them|selves round, and drink it off, each sending a lit|tle Pot full to his best beloved Wife; They lay their hands upon the Head of him that drinks, and cry aloud thrice <HI>Tautosi,</HI> He must not drink off all, but leave a little to throw on the ground to his <HI>Fetisso,</HI> saying <HI>I, ou,</HI> spouting out some on the Arms and Legs of their <HI>Fetisso's,</HI> supposing that otherwise they should not drink in quiet; They are great drinkers, and feed as unmannerly as Swine, sitting on the ground, not swallowing one Morsel after another, but tear their meat to pieces, and throw it into their Mouths, which stand gaping to receive it, they are always hungry, and would eat all day long; Yea the <HI>Europeans</HI> have great Appe|tites while they are there; He that gets most, drinks most of their strong Liquors, for they lay up but little.</P>

<P>THis Fort is in <HI>Bence</HI> Island, and was likewise demolished by the <HI>French</HI> in the late War. It is also rebuilding, and will be secured by Sixteen Guns, and Thirty <HI>Europeans,</HI> besides Mulatto's and Blacks. An <HI>Englishman</HI> dwelt a long time in one of the Isles, having a fine House, and was well be|loved and protected by the Kings of that Coun|trey. In the first War with <HI>Holland</HI> 1666. our Author being aboard a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War, this <HI>English</HI> Factor writ to them divers times to come and Trade with them, and told him he might do it with safety, and upon Parole the <HI>Englishman</HI> cal|led <HI>Abraham</HI> came aboard them in his Shallop, rowed by three Slaves, accompanied by a <HI>Hollander</HI> and two others which belonged to him, and was kindly treated; but afterward the Captain contra|ry to the advice of the rest, treacherously made him a Prisoner, and the three <HI>Moores</HI> with him, to their great surprizal; And <HI>Ian.</HI> 1. 1667. their great Shallop was manned out with thirty Men, and one Cannonto Besiege his House, which was built of Brick and Freestone, defended with four great Guns, incompassed with a fine Wood of Palmtrees, which supplied him with Wine; On one side were about twenty Cabines for the Natives, and on the other a Spring of good Water, it being the most beautiful Island upon the River.</P>
<P>Being about to land, they discovered 200 <HI>Moores</HI> got together about the House with Firelocks, and a greater number farther up in the Woods, which obliged the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to make a show of going up higher, as being weaker, and so had more occasion for the wind, but the <HI>Negroes</HI> thought they had been gone to <HI>Bowre,</HI> and dispatch'd a Canoe to give the King of <HI>Boulom</HI> the Alarum, which was persued by the Enemy, who fired into their Boat, and at length took them; they were two young Slaves belonging

<P>THis Fort is Scituate in <HI>York</HI> River, fortified with Twenty Guns, and a Garrison of an Hundred and Fifty white men, besides Mulatto's and Negro's. The Fort consts of two Palankeys, exceeding strongly built of Stone, and of a great height, in forme of an half Moon.</P>
<P>The Religion of the Natives (if we may so call it) is generally Paganism, they salute the New
<PB N="13" REF="9">
Moon with horrible roarings, and strange gestures of Adoration; they offer their Sacrifices in the Woods before great hollow Trees wherein their Idols are placed; yet this they do rather out of Custom than Zeal, using neither Form nor Method in their Devotions, every one making a God after his own fancy; some seeming to incline to <HI>Mahu|matism,</HI> others to <HI>Iudaism,</HI> and many of them are <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> yet divers affirm, that God who giveth all things, and can do what he pleaseth, and causes Thanders, Lightning, Rain and Wind, is Omnipotent, and needs neither praying to, nor to be set forth in so mysterious a way as that of the Trinity. They believe that when People die they go into another World, and will have occa|sion for many of the same things they use here, and therefore put part of their Housholdstuff into the Grave with the dead Corps; and if they lose any thing, imagine their Friends in the other World had need of it, and have taken it away.</P>
<P>They have no Letters nor Books, yet keep <HI>Tues|day</HI> for a Sabbath, forbearing then their Fishing and Husbandry, and the Palm Wine which is got|ten that day must not be sold, but is offered to the King, who bestows it on his Courtiers to drink at night. On this Day in the midst of the Market|place they place a Table on four Pillars about three yards high, whose flat cover is made of Straw and Reeds woven together, upon which they place many Straw Rings called <HI>Fetisso's</HI> or Gods, and within them set Wheat, Water and Oil for their God whom they imagine devours it; Their Priest they call <HI>Fetissero,</HI> who every Festival day placeth a Seat upon that Table, and sitting thereon, prea|cheth to the People, but what his Doctrine is, the <HI>Europeans</HI> cannot understand: After this the Women offer him their Infants, whom he sprin|kles with Water, wherein a live Snake swims, where|with he likewise besprinkles the Table, and then
<PB N="14" REF="10">
uttering certain words very loud, and stroking the Children with some kind of Colours, as if giving them his Blessing, he himself drinks of that Wa|ter, the People clapping their hands and crying, <HI>I ou, I ou,</HI> and so he dismisseth this devout As|sembly.</P>
<P>Many wear such Rings next their Bodies, to pre|serve them from the mischiefs their angry God might inflict upon them, in honour of whom they daub themselves with a kind of Chalky Earth, which is their Morning Mattens; At their eat|ing, the first bit, and the first draught is conse|crated to their <HI>Fetisso,</HI> wherewith they besprinkle it: If Fishermen have not a good Draught, they present a piece of Gold to the Priest to reconcile them to their frowning Saint, who with his Wives makes a kind of Procession through the Streets, smiting his Breast, and clapping his Hands with a mighty noise, till he comes to the Shore, where they cut down boughs from certain Trees, and hang them on their Necks, playing on a Timbrel; Then the Priest turns to his Wives, and expostu|lates with them, and throws Wheat and other things into the Sea as an Offering to appease the <HI>Fetisso</HI>'s displeasure against the Fishermen; When the King Sacrifices to his <HI>Fetisso,</HI> he commands the Priest or <HI>Fitessero</HI> to inquire of a Tree, whereunto he ascribeth Divinity, what he will demand; The Priest comes to the Tree, and in a heap of Ashes there provided, sticks the Branch of a Tree, and drinking water out of a Bason, spouts it upon the Branch, and then daubeth his Face with the Ashes, after which the Devil out of the Tree gives answer to the Kings questions; The Nobility likewise adore certain Trees, esteeming them Oracles, and they report the Devil sometimes appears to them like a black Dog, and otherwhile answers them without any visible apparition. Some worship a Bird called <HI>Pittoie,</HI> spotted and painted as it were with Stars,
<PB N="15" REF="10">
and resembleth the voice of a Bull; To hear this Bird low in their Journey, is reckoned a good Omen, they saying, their <HI>Fetisso</HI> promises them good Fortune, and so they set a Vessel of Water and Wheat in the place where they hear it; And as the Earth and Air yield them Deities, so the Sea yields certain Fishes whom they Canonize; upon this account, they never take the <HI>Tunny</HI> Fish, the <HI>Swordfish</HI> they eat, but dry the Sword on his back, which is held in great Veneration: Yea the Moun|tains are not without honour, and if they did not pacifie their Anger by setting daily Presents of Meat and Drink thereon, they believe they would bend their sullen Brows, and as their High Tops threaten to scale Heaven, would overwhelm the Earth, and destroy them all.</P>
<P>Neither has Nature alone this priviledge, but Art likewise is concerned in making Gods, com|posed sometimes of filthy things, as of a piece of putrified Earth anointed with Suet, Grease and Oil of Palms, with five or six Parrot Feathers up|right in the middle, to which morning and night they pay their Devotions; when it Thunders, Rains hard, or the wind blows strong, there is not one to be seen in the Streets, all hide themselves in their Houses, and cry, <HI>The Gods of the Whites are angry.</HI> The Devil is so dreadful to them, they tremble at naming him, and say he beats them, and makes them do evil things for their <HI>Fetisso,</HI> which every one carries about him, some are only the ends of Horns filled with Dung, others as the heads of some Creature and the like; which their Priests sell them at their own price, and pretend they found them under the Fetiche Tree. When any one Dies they make a new <HI>Fetisso</HI> or Ring of Straw, and conjure it to keep company and protect the dead in their Journey to the other World; They lay the Corps on a Matt upon the ground, wrapt in Woollen, with a Stool covered with a
<PB N="16" REF="11">
Goat-skin under the head, the body is then strow|ed with Ashes, the Arms laid by its side, and the Eyes open'd; this continues half a day, the best beloved Wife sitting by the Husband (as the Hus|band doth by his first Wife) crying <HI>Aury,</HI> and wiping her Face with a wisp of Straw; Other Women go round the House and Corps, singing and beating on Basons; The Eldest <HI>Morini</HI> or Gen|tleman goes from House to House with a Bason, into which every one puts the value of Twelve Pence in Gold; with this they buy a Cow, with whole Blood the <HI>Fittessero</HI> or Priest appeaseth the <HI>Fetisso,</HI> The Friends and Kindred assembling, pre|pare a Hen, and then seating themselves in a cor|ner of the dead mans House, they place all his <HI>Fe|tisso</HI>'s or Gods on a row, the greatest in the midst, adorning them with Garlands of Pease and Beans, and then sprinkle them with the Blood of the Hen, and hang a Chain or Garland of Herbs about their Necks; after this the Hen being boyl'd, the VVomen set it in the midst of his <HI>Fetisso</HI>'s, and the Priest taking water into his Mouth, amidst his Charms, spits it out on the <HI>Fetisso</HI>'s, and plucking the Herbs from his Neck, he makes a Ball of them, where|with he besmears his Face; which Ball hereby is made a <HI>Fetisso,</HI> and the Party deceased is now at rest.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the dearest of his VVives fills all the House with Mourning, the Neighbours and Friends assisting with Songs and Dances; At length they take up the Corps and carry it to the Grave, which is about four foot deep, and covered with Stakes that nothing may fall therein; The VVomen come about the Sepulchre, and expostulate thus with him in a pitiful and lamenting voice, <Q>Alas, why didst thou dye? Thou hadst so much VVheat, so much Maiz, thou wast beloved of thy Family, and they had great care of thy Person, why wouldst thou dye? what have we deserved,
<PB N="17" REF="11">
wherein have we offended thee, what discontent have we ever given thee, to oblige thee to leave us? <HI>If he be a man, they add;</HI> Thou wert so vali|ant, so generous, thou hast overthrown so many Enemies, thou hast behaved thy self gallently in so many Fights, who shall now defend us from our Adversaries? Wherefore then wouldst thou dye? <HI>Others cry,</HI> He is dead, that brave Huntsman, that excellent Fisherman, that vali|ant Warriour, that great destroyer of <HI>Portugals,</HI> that generous Defender of our Countrey, he is departed this VVorld.</Q> Then they throw on a lit|tle Earth, but none can get into the Corps, for he hath with him his Houshold Stuff, Armour, and whatsoever he used in his life time, and VVine too, if he loved it, to drink in the other VVorld. Lastly, they cover the Sepulchre with a Roof to defend all from Rain; If the King dyes, greater Solemnity is used, yea his Nobles thinking so great a Personage ought to have Attendants, one offers to him a Servant, another a VVife, a third his Son or Daughter, even many of both Sexes to wait upon him, all whom are suddenly slain, and their Bloody Carcasses buried with him; yea the Kings VVives who loved him best, refuse not this last and everlasting Service, but are willing to dye, that they may again live with him. The Heads of the Slain are set upon Poles round about the Se|pulchre; Meat, Drink, Cloths, Arms, and other Utensils are buried with them; After the Funeral, they go to the Sea, and there use other Ceremo|nies, some washing, while others play on Basons and Instruments, where the VViddow or VVid|dower is laid backward on the water with divers words of complaint, at last they return back to the dead Mans House, where they drink them|selves drunk, and wash away all further sorrow.</P>

<P>Those that Address to the King for any favour, make their way with Presents of Ribbons, Elephants Teeth, or such things, which he must deliver at the House of the Kings chiefest Wife, who carries it to the King, requesting that the Person may be admitted into his presence; If the King accept it, the Person hath leave to enter, otherwise if any complaints be brought against him, he sends it back, yet so as the Presenter dares not receive and carry it away, but continues his Suit by Friends without intermission; by whose frequent and re|newed Mediations, the King at last seeming a lit|tle pacified, remits his severity, takes the Present, and calls for the Suppliant, who entring the Royal Presence, goes bowing all along toward the King, who sits on the ground upon a Mat, leaning on a Stool, when he approaches within two steps, he bows himself to the Earth, kneeling upon one Knee with his right Elbow on the ground, and names the Kings Title, <HI>Dondagh,</HI> whereupon the King if pleased Answers, <HI>Namady, I thank you,</HI> if not he sits silent. If it be a Person of Quality and his Sub|ject, the King perhaps causes a Mat to be spread on the ground, upon which sitting at some distance, he moves his request; But if a Forreigner, who comes only to salute the King, he is conducted to him without any further Ceremony, and receives an immediate dispatch; If the Person have any Proposition, Petition, or Complaint to make, an Interpreter is called, who coming with his Bow in his hand, opens the whole matter to the King, sentence by sentence, whereto according to the quality of the Affair he receives Answer, with pro|mise, if upon complaint, that when he hath heard

<P>This <HI>Falma</HI> had been formerly in great favour with the King of <HI>Dogo,</HI> or <HI>Hondo,</HI> but having de|bauched one of his Wives, the King was so offend|ed, that not content it should, as usual, be bought off with Gifts or Slaves, he caused his Ears to be out off, and banished him his presence, but length of time so wore out the Kings Fury, that <HI>Falma</HI>

<P>These Countries produce variety of Creatures, and among others, Tygers and Leopards, who bear great enmity to each other, though generally the Tyger is the Conquerour, therefore when the Leopard is pursued by the Tyger, he with his Tail wipes out his footsteps that so he may not be tra|ced. Some of the Ancients knowing the fierceness of the Tyger, attributed to him the command of the Woods, but in these Parts, because he hurts no man but only Beasts, they make the Leopard King of the Forrest, for which ravening temper they are hunted and killed by all Men, even for their own safety. When a Leopard is killed they bring him dead to the Kings Town, there to be cut up and eaten, being flea'd they present his Skin and Teeth to the King, and the People assembled, eat the Flesh boil'd as a dainty, spending the remainder of the day in Revelling and Dancing, as at their most Solemn Festivals.

There is another strange Beast, like a Crocodile six or seven Foot long, very slender, and the Tongue of an extraordinary length. It is a Beast of Prey, and very strong, close set with gaudy Quills over the whole body, wherewith it offends Men, and defends it self against other Crea|tures, for when the Leopard attempts to seize it, it converts into a round Ball, setting up the points of its Quills that no hold can be fixed, their Food is generally Pismires, which with their Tongues they lick up at a great distance.</P>

<P>HAving met with the following Relation I shall conclude the Account of <HI>Guinea</HI> there|with. In 1668 An <HI>English</HI> Ship bound for <HI>Guinea,</HI> Sailing to <HI>Old Calabar,</HI> they entred a River called the <HI>Cross-River</HI> into <HI>Pirats-Island;</HI> after they had taken in their <HI>Negro</HI>'s, and were ready to Sail, the Master called up the Boatswain and three Men more to look out the Copper Bars that were left, and carry them on Shore to sell; The Boatswain with his small Company desired they might have Arms, not believing they were so harmless a People as
<PB N="52" REF="30">
reported; they took with them three Musquets and a Pistol; and so rowed toward the Shore, but their Match unhappily fell into the Water, and the Ship being fallen down lower toward the Sea quite out of sight, and they ashamed to go back without dispatching their business, <HI>Iohn Watt's</HI> went ashore to the first House to light the match; but before he was twenty Rods from the Water side, he was seized on by two <HI>Blacks</HI> or rather <HI>Tawny-Moores,</HI> and by them haled half a Mile up into the Coun|trey, and thrown with great violence upon his Belly, and so compelled to lye till they stript him; and more Company coming, they were so eager for his poor Canvas Apparel, that some they tore off, others they cut off, and with that several pieces of his flesh to his intolerable pain; With these Rags they made little Aprons to cover their Privities, clothing being very scarce there; The Boatswain seeing <HI>Watts</HI> carried away, resolved with his two Companions to venture their Lives to have him again, and arming themselves they were sud|denly beset with a dosen men in several <HI>Canoes,</HI> but they valiantly maintained their Boat three hours; for after two or three Musquets were dis|charged, they defended themselves with their Oars and Boat hooks; The Boatswain received a mortal wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat, the other two adventured into the River, endeavouring by swimming to escape the Hands of these cruel Infidels; but the <HI>Negro</HI>'s with their swift <HI>Canoes</HI> soon overtook them, and brought them on Shore to the other; They took the Boatswain out of the Boat, and instead of endeavouring to pre|serve what Life remained in him, one of them with a keen Weapon instantly cut off his Head; And while he was yet reeking in his Blood, they in a barbarous manner cut off pieces of Flesh from his Buttocks, Thighs, Arms, and Shoulders, and broil d them on the Coals, and with much impatience eat

it before his Companions Faces to their great astonishment.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight after one of the Company fell sick; And instead of being his Physicians to cure him, they were his Butchers to Murther him, cut|ting off his Head, and broiling and eating his Flesh, rejoicing exceedingly at this rich Banquet. Ten days after the other fell sick, whom they used in the very same manner. <HI>Watts</HI> continued still in Health though the Natives daily expected such another Banquet, because it seems it is not their Custom to kill those that are well, and so resolved to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll him; his Master was free to discourse, especially since he had before learned the <HI>Tata</HI> Language in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> which is easily attained, being comprehen|ded in few words, and all the <HI>Negro</HI>'s speak it. He began to discourse his Master of the reason of their cruelty, who told him, he should be content, for if he were not sick, he should not have his Head cut off; In the Boat which they took there was one Musket saved that was not discharged, which his Master some time after brought to him to know the use of; <HI>Watts</HI> endeavoured to keep him in igno|rance, but being threatned, at length was forced to shoot it off; but the <HI>Negro</HI>'s who expected some delightful thing were frustrated, and at the sudden noise and flash of Fire, which they much dread, ran from him affrighted, but hearing no more noise came up again, and commanded him to do the like, he told them he had no Powder which caused the noise; but this would not satisfie these Barbarians, who were about to murder him for refusal, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ot his Master prevented it; After in discourse his Master told him, that the People were naturally civil, and simply honest, but it provoked full of Revenge, and that this cruelty toward him and his Friends was occasioned by the unhandsome car|rying away some Native, without their leave about a year before, they resolving if any came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">

they should never go off alive; He had not been above seven Weeks in the Countrey but his Master presented him to the King, whose name was <HI>Efme</HI> King of the <HI>Buckamores,</HI> who immediately gave him to his Daughter <HI>Onijah;</HI> When the King went abroad, he at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ended him as his Page throughout the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above twelve miles, yet boasting exceedingly of his Power and Strength, and glorying extreamly that he had a <HI>White</HI> to attend him, whom he im|ployed to carry his Bow and Arrows. At several places remote from the Seaside, some of the Peo|ple would run away from him for fear, others fell down and seem'd to worship him, using those Acti|ons they do to their Gods. Their Progress was never so long, but they could return home at Night, yet never without a full Dose of the Creature.</P>
<P>During all the time <HI>Watts</HI> was a Slave he never knew him go abroad and come home sober.

<PB N="55" REF="31">
greatness of one of his Kingdoms, the several Shires, and Counties it contained, with the number of its Cities, Towns and Castles, and the strength of each, the infinite Inhabitants and valour of his Subjects; One of these sufficiently amazed this petty Governour, that he need mention no more of His Majesties Glory and Dignity; It put him into such a profound Consternation, that he resolved to find out some way to tender his respects to this Mighty Prince, and could study none more convenient, than that if he could find a passage he would let him go to <HI>England,</HI> to inform King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. of the great favour and respect he had for him; This did not a little rejoice our <HI>Englishman;</HI> He also told him that he would send him a Present, which should be two Cabareets or Goats, which they there value at a high rate, this King having himself not above seventeen or eighteen.

<P>Though our Captive lived happily with this King, yet his desires and hopes were still to return to his Native Countrey, at length he promised him, that the first <HI>English</HI> Ship which came into the Road, should have liberty to release or purchase him; This much rejoiced his Heart now he thought every day a year, till he could hear of, or see some <HI>English</HI> Ship arrived. Oft did he walk down to the Sea-side, earnestly expecting the winds of Provi|dence would blow some in thither; which being observed by one <HI>Iaga</HI> the chiefest Wizard in those parts, and much admired by the People (though they have a multitude of others) this man came to him one day, and inquired why he went so often to the Sea shore, he told him, to see if he could discover any <HI>English</HI> Vessel come in there and knowing he was a Wizard, though not acquainted

with his great Fame, nor willing to credit his Di|vinations, yet to please him, askt when he did believe there would one come in; <HI>Iaga</HI> instantly told him; <HI>That the fifteenth day after, an</HI> English <HI>Ship would c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">me into the Road.</HI> He then demanded whether that Ship should carry him away, he answered doubtfully, but said, he should be offe|red to the Master of the Ship, and if they did not agree, but he should come ashore again, and not be sold, he would soon dye of grief. These fifteen days seemed very long, many a look did he cast on the Sea with an aking Heart, the fourteenth day he went to an high hill, but he could discover nothing; next Morning he went again two or three times but saw none; about two or three hours after, some of the <HI>Moors</HI> came running to the King, telling him there was a Canoe coming, so they call our Ships, at which our <HI>Englishman</HI> rejoiced, hoping to be re|least, yet durst not shew it for fear of punishment or death; for though he lived better now than with his first Master, yet his Service was far worse than the Slaves in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and their Diet worse than Dogs meat, The Ship came in, and he runs to <HI>Iaga</HI> to know if it were an <HI>English</HI> Ship, who assured him it was, and so it happened; one Captain <HI>Roy|den</HI> being Commander, who hastned to dispatch his business, took in his <HI>Negro</HI>'s, and was ready to Sail, our Captive not hearing a word what should become of him, the King never offering to sell him; This made him resolve to endeavour an escape; he had prepared a piece of Timber, and drawn it to|ward the water-side, on which he intended to pad|dle to the Ship, which lay about a League off.</P>
<P>Just by the Sea-side as he was about to lanch his floating stick, he espied a great <HI>Alligator,</HI> which will devour a man at a mouthful, this altered his mind, resolving rather to live with Infidels, than be accessary to his own death; But next day it pleased God to move the Kings Heart to let him go,

<P>BEfore I come to relate the Acquisitions of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> &amp;c.

It is called the Sea Inn, because the <HI>English</HI> and other Nations stop there as a place for watering and refreshment in their Long Voyages to <HI>India.</HI> It was formerly sei|zed by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but retaken <HI>May</HI> 6th, 1673 by Captain <HI>Munday,</HI> with a Squadron of <HI>English</HI> Ships, and 3 Rich <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Ships made Prizes in the Harbor; since which the Company have forti|fied and secured it, against any future invasion of <HI>Dutch, Portuguese,</HI> or <HI>Spaniards.</HI> It was called <HI>Santa Helena</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who discovered it on St. <HI>Hellens</HI> Day, being <HI>April</HI> 2. There is no Island in the World so far distant from the Conti|nent or main Land as this. It is about Sixteen Leagues in Compass, in the <HI>Ethiopick-</HI>Sea; in 16 Degrees of South Latitude; about 1500 Miles from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> 360 from <HI>Angola</HI> in <HI>Africa;</HI>

and 510 from <HI>Brasile</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> It lyes high out of the Water, and surrounded on the Sea-coasts with steep Rocks, having within many Cliffs&punc; Moun|tains and Valleys, of which one is named <HI>Church-Valley,</HI> where behind a small Church they climb up to the Mountains. To the South is <HI>Apple-Dale,</HI> so called from the abundance of Oranges, Lemons and Pomegranats enough to furnish five or six Ships. On the West side of the Church, Ships have good Anchorage close under the Shore, to prevent the Winds which blow fiercely from the adjacent high Mountains.</P>
<P>The Air seems temperate and healthful, so that sick men brought ashore there, in a short time re|cover; Yet the heat in the Valleys is as intollera|ble as the cold upon the Mountains; It commonly rains there five or six times a day, so that the baren|ness of the Hills is not occasioned for want of Wa|ter, of which it hath two or three good Springs for furnishing Ships with fresh Water; The ground of its own accord brings forth wild Pease and Beans, also whole Woods of Orange, Lemon, and Pomegranat Trees, all the year long laden both with Blossoms and Fruit, good Figs; abundance of Ebo|ny and Rose-trees, Parsly, Mustard-seed, Purslain, Sorrel, and the like; The Woods and Mountains are full of Goats, large Rams, and wild Swine, but difficult to be taken. When the <HI>Portuguese</HI> disco|vered it, they found neither four-footed Beasts nor Fruit-trees, but only fresh Water; They afterward planted Fruit-trees, which so increased since, that all the Valleys stand full of them; Partridges, Pigeons, Moor-hens, and Peacocks breed here nu|merously, whereof a good Marksman may soon pro|vide a Dinner for his Friends. On the Cliff-Islands, on the South are thousands of grey and black Mews, or Sea-Pies, and white and coloured Birds, some with long, others with short Necks, who lay their Eggs on the Rocks, and suffer themselves to be taken

But this and much more must be left to the Criticks, as well as the following Relation of our little Eye-witness and great Discoverer, which you shall have in his own <HI>Spanish</HI> Style, and delive|red with that Grandeur and thirst of Glory, which is generally imputed to that Nation.</P>
<P>It is known to all the Countries of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> that I <HI>Domingo Gonsales</HI> was born of a Noble Family in the renowned City of <HI>Sevil</HI> My Fathers name being <HI>Therando Gonsales</HI> near kinsman on the Mo|thers side to <HI>Don Pedro Sanches</HI> the worthy Count of <HI>Almanera,</HI> My Mother was the Daughter of the famous Lawyer <HI>Otho Perez de Sallaveda</HI> Governour of <HI>Barcellona,</HI> and <HI>Corrigidor</HI> of <HI>Biscay;</HI> I being the youngest of seventeen Children, was put to School, and designed to the Church; But Heaven purpo|sing to use my Service in matters of far another Nature, inspired me with spending some time in the Wars; It was at the time that <HI>Don Ferando,</HI> the renowned Duke D' <HI>Alva</HI> was sent into the Low Countreys in 1568. I then following the current of my desire leaving the University of <HI>Salamanea,</HI> whither my Parents had sent me, without giving notice to any of my Friends, got through <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where I arrived in a mean condition. For
<PB N="62" REF="35">
having sold my Books, Bedding and other things which yielded me about 30 Duckets, and borrow|ed twenty more of my Fathers Friends, I bought a little Nag, wherewith I travelled more thriftily than usually young Gentlemen do, till arriving with|in a League of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> some of the cursed <HI>Gueses</HI> set upon me, and bereaved me of my Horse, Money, and all; so I was forc'd through necessity to enter into the Service of Marshal <HI>Cossey</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Noble|man, whom I served in an honourable imploy, though mine Enemies to my disgrace, affirm I was his Horse-keepers Boy; But for that matter, I re|fer my self to Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and other Persons of condition, who have often testified to many worthy men, the very truth of the business, which indeed was this, Monsieur <HI>Cossey</HI> being about this time sent to the Duke <HI>D' Alva</HI> Governour of the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> he understanding the Nobility of my Birth, and my late misfortune, judging it would be no small honour to him to have a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of that Quality about him, furnished me with a Horse, Arms and whatever I wanted, using my Service, after I had learned <HI>French,</HI> in writing his Letters, because my Hand was very fair. In time of War if upon necessity, I sometime dressed my own Horse, I ought not to be reproacht therewith, since I count it the part of a Gentleman to submit to the vilest Office for the Service of his Prince.</P>
<P>The first expedition I was in, was when the Marshal my Friend met the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> making a Road into <HI>France,</HI> and forced him to fly even to the Walls of <HI>Cambray;</HI> It was my good Fortune to defeat a Trooper by killing his Horse with my Pistol, who falling upon his Leg could not stir, but yielded to my mercy; I knowing my own weakness of Body, and seeing him a lusty tall Fel|low, thought it the surest way to dispatch him, which having done, I plundered him of a Chain, Money, and other things to the value of 200 Du|cats;
<PB N="63" REF="35">
This Money was no sooner in my Pockets, but I resumed the remembrance of my Nobility, and taking my audience of leave from Monsieur <HI>Gossey,</HI> I instantly repaired to the Duke <HI>D' Alva</HI>'s Court, where divers of my Kindred seeing my Pocket full of good Crowns, were ready enough to acknowledge me; By their means I was received into pay, and in time obtained favour with the Duke, who would sometimes jest a little more severely at my Perso|nage than I could well bare, for though I must ac|knowledge my Stature is so little, as I think no man living is less, yet since it is the work of Heaven, and not my own, he ought not to have upbraided a Gentleman therewith; And those glorious things that have happened to me may evince, that won|derful matters may be performed by very unlikely Bodies, if the mind be good, and Fortune second our endeavours;</P>
<P>Though the Dukes joques a little disgusted me, yet I endeavoured to conceal my re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">entment, and accommodating my self to some other of his hu|mors, I was so far interested in his favour, that at his going into <HI>Spain.</HI> whither I attended him, by his kindness, and other accidents, wherein by my Industry I was seldom wanting to my self, I was able to carry home 3000 Crowns in my Pocket.</P>
<P>At my return, my Parents, who were extreamly disturbed at my departure, received me with joy, which was increased because they found I had brought wherewith to maintain my self without being chargeable to them, or lessening the Portions of my Brothers and Sisters. But doubting I would spend it as lightly as I got it, they sollicited me to marry the Daughter of <HI>Iohn Figueres</HI> a considera|ble Merchant of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to which I complied, and putting my Marriage Money, and good part of my own into the hands of my Father, I lived like a Gentleman many years very happily; At length a quarrel-arising between me and <HI>Pedro Delgades</HI> a
<PB N="64" REF="36">
Gentleman and Kinsman of mine, it grew so high, that when no mediation of Friends could prevail, we two went alone with our Swords into the Field, where it was my chance to kill him, though a stout proper man; but what I wanted in strength I sup|plied in courage, and my agility countervailed for his Stature. This being acted in <HI>Carmona,</HI> I fled to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> thinking to conceal my self with some Friends of my Father in Law&punc; till the business might be accommodated, At which time, a famous <HI>Spanish</HI> Count coming from the <HI>West Indies,</HI> published Tri|umphant Declarations, of a great Victory he had obtained against the <HI>English</HI> near the <HI>Isle of Pines,</HI> whereas in reality he got nothing at all in that Voy|age but blows, and a considerable loss. It had been well if vanity and lying had been his only crimes; His covetousness had like to have been my utter ruin, though since it hath proved the occasion of Eternizing my name I verily believe to all Posteri|ty, and to the unspeakable benefit of all Mortals for ever hereafter, at least if it please Heaven that I return home safe to my Countrey, and give per|fect Instructions how those almost incredible and impossible Acquirements may be imparted to the World. You shall then see men flying in the Air from one place to another, you shall then be able to send Messages many hundred miles in an instant, and receive answers immediately, without the help of any Creature upon Earth; You shall then pre|sently impart your mind to your Friend though in the most remote and obscure place of a populous City, and a multitude of other notable Experi|ments; But what exceeds all, you shall then have the discovery of a <HI>New World,</HI> and abundance of rare and incredible secrets of Nature, which the Philosophers of former Ages never so much as dreamt of; But I must be cautious in publishing these wonderful mysteries, till our Statesmen have considered how they may consist with the Policy

and good Government of our Countrey, and whe|ther the Fathers of the Church may not judge the divulging them prejudicial to the Catholick Faith, which (by those wonders I have seen above any mortal man before me) I am instructed to advance without respect to any temporal advantage whatso|ever.</P>
<P>But to proceed; This huffing Captain, preten|ded much discontent for the Death of <HI>Delgades,</HI> who was indeed some Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to him; however he was willing to be quiet if I would give him a thousand Duckets; I had now, besides a Wife, two Sons, whom I was not willing to begger, only to satisfie the avaritious humour of this Boaster, and so was necessitated to take some other course; I imbarkt in a stout Carrick bound for the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> carrying the value of two thousand Duckets to Trade with, leaving as much more for the support of my Wife and Children behind, whatever misfortune might happen to me; In the <HI>Indies</HI> I thrived exceeding|ly, laying out my Stock in Diamonds, Emeralds and Pearls, which I bought at such easy rates, that my Stock safely arriving in <HI>Spain</HI> (as I under|stood it did) must needs yield ten for one. But having doubled <HI>Cape Buona Esperanza</HI> in my way home, I fell dangerously sick, expecting nothing but death, which had undoubtedly happened, but that we just then recovered the Blessed Isle of St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> the only Paradice I believe on Earth, for healthfulness of Air, and fruitfulness of Soil, produ|cing all necessaries for the Life of man; It is about 16 Leagues in compass, and has no firm Land or Continent within 300 Leagues, nay not so much as an Island within an hundred Leagues of it; so that it may seem a Miracle of Nature, that out of so vast and tempestuous an Ocean, such a small Rock or piece of ground should arise and discover it self. On the South is a good Harbour, and near it divers small Houses built by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to accomodate
<PB N="66" REF="37">
Strangers, with a pretty Chappel handsomely beau|tified with a Tower, and Bell therein. Near it is a Stream of excellent fresh water, divers handsome walks planted on both sides with Orange, Lemmon, Pomegranate, Almond-trees and the like, which bare Fruit all the year, as do also divers others; There are store of Garden Herbs, with Wheat, Pease, Barley, and most kinds of Pulse; but it chiefly aboundeth with Cattel and Fowl, as Goats, Swine, Sheep, Partridges, wild Hens, Pheasants, Pigeons, and wild Fowl beyond credit; But especially about <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> are to be seen huge Flocks of a kind of <HI>wild Swans,</HI> (whereof I shall have occa|sion to speak more hereafter) who like our Cuckoes and Nightingales, go away at a certain Season, and are no more seen that year.</P>
<P>On this happy Island did they set me ashore with a <HI>Negro</HI> to attend me, where I recovered my health, and continued a whole year, solacing my self for want of Humane Society with birds and brute Beasts; <HI>Diego</HI> my Black-moor was forced to live in a Cave at the West-end of the Isle, for had we dwelt together, Victuals would not have been so plenty with us; but now if one succeeded well in Hunting or Fowling, the other would find means to treat him, and if both mist, we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ain to look out sharply; but this seldom happened, since no Creature there fears a man more than a Goat or Cow, whereby I easily tamed divers kinds of birds and beasts by only muzling them, so that till they came either to me or <HI>Diego</HI> they could not feed; at first I much delighted in a kind of Par|tridges, and a tame Fox, whereof I made good use; For if I had occasion to confer with <HI>Diego,</HI> I would take one of them muzled and hungry, and tying a note about his neck, beat him from me, whereupon he would streight away to <HI>Diego</HI>'s Cave, and if he were not there, would beat about till he found him; yet this conveyance being not
<PB N="67" REF="37">
without some inconvenience, I perswaded <HI>Dieg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> (who though a fellow of good Parts, was content to be ruled by me) to remove to a Cape on the north-west part of the Island, being though a League off, yet within sight of my house and Chap|pel, and so when the weather was fair, we could by signals declare our minds each to other in an instant either by night or day, wherein we took much pleasure. If in the night I would signifie any thing to him, I set up a light in the bell Tower, which was a pretty large Room with a fair Window well glazed, and the walls within plaistered white, so that though the light were but small, it made a great show; after this light had stood half an hour I covered it, and then if I saw any signal of light again from my Companion I knew he waited for my notice, and so by hiding and shewing my light according to the agreement betwixt us I certified him of what I pleased. In the day I advertised him by Smoke, Dust, and other refined ways.</P>
<P>After a while I grew weary of it as too painful, and again used my Winged Messengers; Upon the shoar, about the Mouth of our River, I found store of a kind of <HI>Wild Swans</HI> feeding upon prey, both of fish and birds, and which is more strange having one Claw like an Eagle, and the other like a Swan. These birds breeding here in infinite numbers, I took thirty or forty of them young, and bred them up by hand for recreation; yet not without some thoughts of that experiment which I after put in practice. These being strong and able to continue a great flight, I taught them first to come at call afar off, not using any noise, but only shewing them a White Cloth; and here I found it true what <HI>Plutarch</HI> affirms, <HI>That Creatures which eat Flesh are more docible than others.</HI> 'Tis wonderful to think what Tricks I taught them ere they were a quarter old, amongst others I used them by degrees to fly with Burdens, wherein I found them able beyond
<PB N="68" REF="38">
belief, and a white sheet being displayed to them by <HI>Diego</HI> upon the side of a hill, they would carry from me to him bread, flesh, or whatever I pleased, and upon the like call come to me again. Having proceeded thus far, I consulted how to join a num|ber of them together, so as to carry a heavier weight, which if I could compass, I might enable a man to be carried safely in the Air from one place to another. I puzled my Wits extreamly with this thought, and upon Trial found that if many were put to the bearing of one great Burthen, by reason it was impossible all of them should rise together just at one instant, the first that rise finding him|self stayed by a weight heavier than he could stir, would soon give over, and so the second, third, and all the rest. I contrived at last a way whereby each might rise with only his own proportion of weight, I fastned about each <HI>Gansa</HI> a little Pulley of <HI>Cork,</HI> and putting a string of a just length through it, I fastned one end to a block of almost eight pound weight, and tyed a two pound weight to the other end of the string, and then causing the signal to be Erected, they all rose together, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g four in number, and carried away my block to the place appointed. This hitting so luckily, I added two or three birds more, and made Tryal of their carrying a Lamb, whose happiness I much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">vied, that he should be the first living creature to partake of such an excellent device.</P>
<P>At length after divers Tryals, I was surprized with a great longing to cause my self to be carried in the same manner, <HI>Diego</HI> my Moor was likewise possest with the same desire, and had I not loved him well, and wanted his Service, I should have resented his ambitious thought; For I count it greater honour to have been the first <HI>Flying Man,</HI> than to be another <HI>Neptune</HI> who first adventured to Sail on the Sea. Yet seeming not to understand his intention, I only told him that all my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s
<PB N="69" REF="38">
were not strong enough to carry him, being a man though of no great Bulk, yet twice heavier than my self; Having prepared all necessaries, I one time placed my self and all my Utensils on the top of a Rock at the Rivers Mouth, and putting my self upon my Engine at full Sea, I caused <HI>Diego</HI> to ad|vance the signal, whereupon my Birds, 25 in number rose all at once, and carried me over lusti|ly to the Rock on the other side, being about a quarter of a League; I chose this time and place, because if any thing had fallen out contrary to ex|pectation, the worst that could happen was only falling into the Water, and being able to swim well, I hoped to receive little hurt in my fall; When I was once safe over, O how did my heart even swell with Joy and admiration at my own In|vention; How oft did I wish my self in the midst of <HI>Spain,</HI> that I might fill the World with the fame of my Glory and Renown? Every hour I had a longing desire for the coming of the <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet to take me home with them, which then stay'd, three Months beyond their usual time; At length they arrived being three Carricks much weather-beaten, the men Sick and Weak, and so were constrain'd to refresh themselves in our Island a whole Month; The Admiral was called <HI>Alphonso de Xima,</HI> a Valliant Wise Man, desirous of Glory, and worthy better Fortune than afterward befell him; To him I discovered my device of the <HI>Gansa's</HI> being satisfied, that it was impossible otherwise to perswade him to take so many Birds into his Ship, who for the niceness of their provision, would be more trouble|som than so many men; Yet I adjured him by Oaths and Perswasions to be secret in the business, though I did not much doubt it assuring my self he durst not impart the Experiment to any before our King were acquainted therewith. I had more apprehension, lest Ambition and the desire of gaining to himself the honour of so admirable an
<PB N="70" REF="39">
Invention should tempt him to dispatch me. How|ever I was forc't to run the Risque unless I would adventure the loss of my Birds, the like whereof for my purpose were not to be had in Christendom, nor was I sure ever to bring up others to serve my turn.</P>

The Bark escaped unpursued and another of our Carricks after some chase was given over by the Enemy, who expecting a sufficient Booty of us, and getting us between them, fell upon us with much fury; our Captain hereupon gave direction to run ashoar upon <HI>Teneriff,</HI> the Port whereof we could not recover, saying, <HI>That he hoped to save part of the Goods, and some of our Lives, and he had ra|ther the rest should be lost, than all fall into the mer|cy of our foes.</HI></P>
<P>When I heard this Resolution, observing the Sea to work high, and knowing all the Coast to be so full of Rocks and Shoals, that it was impossible our Ship should come near the Land unless broken into a thousand pieces, I represented to the Cap|tain the desperateness of the attempt, wishing him rather to try the kindness of the Enemy, than throw away himself and so many brave men; But he would by no Remonstrances be removed from his Resolution, therefore finding it high time to shift for my self, I lockt up my little Casket of Jewels, which putting into my sleeve, I then be|took me to my <HI>Gansa's,</HI> and having harnassed them to my Engine, and put my self thereon, supposing, as indeed it happened, that when the Ship should split, my Birds though they wanted their signal, yet for saving their own lives, which nature hath taught all Creatures to preserve, would make to|ward Land, which fell out, according to my ex|pectation; The People in the Ship wondred what I was doing, none being acquainted with the use of my Birds but the Captain, <HI>Diego</HI> being in the other Ship which fled away unpursued; We were about half a League from Land, when our Carrick struck upon a Rock, and split to pieces, upon which I let

loose the reins to my Birds, having first placed my self upon the top of the Deck, and with the Shock they all arose carrying me fortunately to the Land, of which you need not doubt but I was very joy|ful, though it was a miserable fight to behold my Friends and acquaintance in that wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ul distress, of whom yet many escaped better than they ex|pected, for the <HI>English</HI> lanching out their Cock-boats, discovered more generous tempers than we are pleased to allow them, taking compassion of their calamity, and endeavouring with all diligence to save them from the fury of the Waves though with much danger to themselves; among others they took up our Captain, who, as Father <HI>Pacio</HI> since told me, having put himself with twelve others into the Cock-boat, was forced to yield to one Captain <HI>Raymundo,</HI> who carried him and our Pilot along with them in their Voyage to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> whither they were bound, but it was their hard fate by a breach of the Sea neer Cape <HI>Buona Esperanca</HI> to be swallowed of the Merci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ess Waves, whose Rage they a while before had so hardly esca|ped; The rest as I likewise heard, who were about twenty six Persons they took into their Ship, and set them a land at <HI>Cape Verde.</HI></P>
<P>As for my self being now ashoar in an Island inhabited by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I reckoned I was safe, but found my self mistaken, for it was my hap to pitch upon that part of the Isle where the <HI>Pike</HI> begins to rise, which is inhabited by a Savage People who live upon the sides of that Hill, the top whereof is for the most part covered with Snow, and former|ly accounted, for its Steepness inaccessible either for man or Beast, yet these Salvages fearing the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> keep as neer the top as they can, never coming down into the fruitful valleys but to seek for Booty, a crew of these Out-Laws happened to spy me soon after I landed, and thinking they had got a prize, approacht me with all speed; I guest

their design before they came within half a Mile, when perceiving them come down the Hill directly toward me, with long slaves and other Weapons, I thought it necessary to secure my self from these Villains, who out of hatred to us <HI>Spaniards,</HI> would have cut me to peices; The Countrey was Sandy, but the <HI>Pike</HI> beginning to lift up it self, I espled in the side a white Cliff, which I hoped my <HI>Gan|za's</HI> would take for a Mark, and being put up, would make all that way, whereby I might be carried so far that those Barbarous Raskals should not over|take me, before I got to some <HI>Spaniards</HI> House, or hid my self, till by the covert of the night I might travel to <HI>Laguna</HI> the chief City of the Island, three Miles off. So I setled my self upon my Engine, and let loose the Reins to my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s who by good for|tune took all one course, though not just the way I aimed at. But what of that! O Reader prick up thy Ears and prepare thy self to hear the strangest chance that ever happened to any Mortal, and which I know thou wilt not have the grace to be|lieve till thou seest the like Experiment, which I doubt not in a short time may be performed. My <HI>Gansa's</HI> like so many Horses that had gotten the bit between their Teeth, made not their flight, toward the Cliff I intended, though I used my wonted means to direct the Leader of the Flock that way, but with might and main took up toward the top of the <HI>Pike,</HI> and never stopt till they came there, a place in vulgar estimation <HI>(though since experimen|tally contradicted)</HI> fifteen Miles in height. What kind of place this was I would gladly relate, but that I hasten to matters of greater Importance; When I was set down there my poor <HI>Gansa's</HI> fell to panting, blowing, and gaping for breath as if they would all have died, so I did not trouble them a while, forbearing to draw them in, which they never use to indure without strugling, but little did I expect what followed.</P>

It was now the season that these Birds take their flight away, as our Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ko's and Swallows do in <HI>Spain</HI> toward <HI>Autumn,</HI> and as I afterward found, being mindful of their usual Voyage, just when I began to settle my self to take them in, they with one con|sent rose up, and having no other higher place to make toward, to my unspeakable fear and amaze|ment, struck bolt upright, and never left towring upward, still higher and higher, for the space as I guest, of an Hour, after which I thought they la|boured less than before, till at length; Ah wonder|ful! they remained immoveable as steadily as if they had sate upon so many perches; the lines slacked, neither I, nor the Engine moved at all&punc; but continued still, as having no manner of weight&punc; I found then by Experience what no Philosopher ever dream't of, namely, that those things we call heavy do not fall toward the center of the Earth as their natural place, but are drawn by a secret pro|perty of the Globe of the Earth, or rather something within it, as the Load-stone draweth Iron which is within the Compass of its attractive Beams. For though my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s could continue unmoved with|out being sustained by any thing but the Air as easi|ly and quietly as a Fish in the Water, yet if they forced themselves never so little it is impossible to imagine with what swiftness they were carried, either upward, downward or side ways; I must in|genuously confess my horrour and amazement in this place was such, that had I not been arm'd with a true <HI>Spanish</HI> Resolution I should certainly have died for fear.</P>
<P>The next thing that disturb'd me was the swift|ness of the motion, which was so extraordinary that it almost stopt my breath, if I should liken it to an Arrow out of a Bow, or a Stone thrown down from the top of an high Tower, it would come vastly short of it; Another thing was exceeding troublesom to me, that is the Illusions of Devi's
<PB N="76" REF="42">
and Wicked Spirits, who the first day of my arri|val came about me in great numbers in the likeness of Men and Women, wondring at me like so many Birds about an Owl, and speaking several Langua|ges which I understood not, till at last I met with some that spoke good <HI>Spanish,</HI> some <HI>Dutch,</HI> and others <HI>Italian,</HI> all which I understood; And here I had on|ly a touch of the Suns absence once for a short time, having him ever after in my sight. Now though my <HI>Gansa's</HI> were entangled in my lines, yet they easily seized upon divers kinds of Flies and Birds, especially Swallows and Cuckoes whereof there were multitudes even like Motes in the Sun, though I never saw them eat any thing at all. I was much obliged to those, whether Men or Devils I know not, who among divers discourses told me, <Q>If I would follow their Directions, I should not only be carried safe home, but be assured to com|mand at all times all the pleasures of that place.</Q> To which motion not daring to give a flat denial, I desired time to consider, and withal intreated them, (though I felt no hunger at all, which may seem strange) to help me to some Victuals least I should starve in my Journey; So they readily brought me very good Flesh and Fish of several sorts and well drest, but that it was extream fresh without any relish of Salt. Wine likewise I tasted of divers kinds as good as any in <HI>Spain,</HI> and Beer no better in all <HI>Antwerp.</HI> They advised me that while I had opportunity I should make my Provi|sions; telling me that till the next <HI>Thursday</HI> they could help me to no more; at which time they would find means to carry me back, and set me safe in <HI>Spain</HI> in any place I would desire, provided I would become one of their Fraternity, and enter into such Covenants as they had made to their Cap|tain and Master whom they would not name, I ans|wered civilly,<Q> I saw little reason to rejoice in such an offer, desiring them to be mindful of me
<PB N="77" REF="42">
as occasion served;</Q>So for that time I was rid of them; having first furnished my Pockets with as much Victuals as I could thrust in, among which I would be sure to find a place for a small Bottle of good Canary.</P>
<P>I shall now declare the quality of the place wherein I was; The Clouds I perceived to be all under between me and the Earth. The Stars, be|cause it was always day, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> saw at all times alike, not shining bright as we see in the night upon Earth, but of a whitish colour like the Moon with us in the day time, those that were seen, which were not many, shewed far greater than with us, yea as I guest no less than ten times bigger; As for the Moon, being then within 2 days of the change, she appeared of an huge and dreadful greatness. It is not to be forgot that no Stars appeared but o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> that part of the Hemisphere next the Moon, and the nearer to her, the larger they appear'd Again, whether I lay quiet and rested, or were carried in the Air, I perceived my self to be always directly between the Moon and the Earth, whereby 'tis plain that my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s took their way directly toward the Moon, and that when we rested, as we did at first for many hours, either we were insensibly car|ried round about the Globe of the Earth, though I perceived no such motion, or else that according to the opinion of <HI>Copernicus,</HI> the Earth is carried about, and turneth round perpetually from West to East, leaving to the Planets only that motion which the Astronomers call natural, and is not upon the Poles of the Equinoctial, commonly cal|led the Poles of the World, but upon those of the Zodiack; The Air in that place I found without any wind, and exceeding temperate, neither hot nor cold, where neither the Sun beams had any Subject to reflect upon, nor the Earth and Water so near to affect the Air with their natural Quali|ty of coldness; As for the Philosophers attribu|ting
<PB N="78" REF="43">
heat and moisture to the Air, I alwaies esteem'd it a fancy; Lastly, I remember that after my departure from the Earth, I never felt either hunger or thirst, whether the purity of the Air, freed from the Vapors of the Earth and Water, might yield nature sufficient nourishment, or what else might be the cause I cannot determine, but so I found it, though I was perfectly in health both of body and mind, even above my usual Vigor.</P>
<P>Some hours after the departure of that Devilish Company my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s began to bestir themselves, still directing their course toward the Globe or body of the Moon, making their way with such incredible swiftness, that I conceive they advan|ced little less than fifty Leagues in an hour, in which passage I observed three things very Remar|kable, one that the farther we went the less the Globe of the Earth appear'd to us, and that of the Moon still larger; Again the Earth, which I had ever in mine eye, seemed to mask it self with a kind of brightness like another Moon, and as we discern certain Spots or Clouds as it were in the Moon, so did I then see the like in the Earth; but whereas the form of those Spots in the Moon are always the same, these on the Earth seemed by degrees to change every hour; the reason whereof seems to be, that whereas the Earth according to his natural motion (for such a motion I am now satisfied she hath according to the opinion of <HI>Coper|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">cus)</HI> turns round upon her own Axis every four and twenty hours from West to East) I should at first see in the middle of the Body of this New Star the Earth, a Spot like a Pear with a Morsel bit out on one side, in some hours I should observe this Spot move away toward the East; This no doubt was the main Land of <HI>Africa;</HI> Then might I per|ceive a great shining brightness in that place which continued about the same time, and was question|less the vast <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; After this succeeded
<PB N="79" REF="43">
a Spot almost Oval, just as we see <HI>America</HI> described in our Maps, then another immense cleerness re|presenting <HI>Mare del Zur</HI> or the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and lastly a number of Spots like the Countreys and Islands in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> so that it seemed to me no other than an huge Mathematical Globe turned round leisurely be ore me, wherein successively all the Countreys of our earthly World were within twen|ty four hours represented to my view, and this was all the means I now had to number the days, and reckon the time.</P>
<P>I could now wish that Philosophers and Mathe|maticians would confess their own blindness, who have hitherto made the World believe that the Earth hath no motion, and to confirm it are forc't to attribute to every one of the celestial Bodies two Motions directly contrary to each other, one from the East to the West to be perform'd in twenty four hours with an impetuous rapid motion; the other from West to East in several proportions; O incredible supposition! That those huge Bodies of the fixed Stars in the highest Orb, whereof they confess divers are above an hundred times bigger than the whole Earth, should like so many Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s in a Cart wheel be whirled about in so short a time; whereas it is many thousand years, no less (say they) than thirty thousand, before that Orb finishes his course from West to East, which they call his na|tural motion; Now whereas they allow their na|tural course from West to East to every one of them, therein they do well; The Moon performs it in seven and twenty days, the <HI>Sun, Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> in a year or thereabout, <HI>Mars</HI> in three year, <HI>Iupiter</HI> in twelve, and <HI>Saturn</HI> in thirty. But to attribute to these celestial Bodies contrary motions at once, is an absurd conceit, and much more to ima|gine that the same Orb wherein the fixed Stars are, whose natural course takes up so many thousands of years, should be turned about every twenty four
<PB N="80" REF="44">
hours. I will not go so far as <HI>Copernicus</HI> who makes the Sun the center of the Earth and immoveable, neither will I be positive in any thing, only this I say&punc; allow the Earth its motion, which these eyes of mine can testify to be true, and all those absur|dities are removed, every one having only his own single and proper motion.</P>
<P>But where am I? I promised an history, and am unawares turn'd disputer. One Accident more befell me worth mention, that during my stay I saw a kind of a reddish Cloud coming toward me, and con|tinually approaching nearer, which at last I per|ceived was nothing but a huge swarm of Locusts. He that reads the discourses of learned men con|cerning them, as <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> and others who relate that they are seen in the Air several days before they fall on the Earth, and adds thereto this experience of mine, will easily conclude that they can come from no other place than the Globe of the Moon. But now give me leave to go on quiet|ly in my Journey for eleven or twelve days, during all which time I was carried directly toward the Globe or Body of the Moon, with such a violent Whirling as is inexpressible, for I cannot imagine a Bullet out of a Cannon could make&punc; way through the vaporous and muddy Air neer the Earth with half that celerity; which is the more strange since my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s moved their Wings but now and then, and sometimes for a quarter of an hour not at all, only holding them stretcht out, as we see Kites, and Eagles sometimes do for a short space; during which pauses I suppose they took their Naps, and times of Sleeping, for other times I could perceive they never had any; For my self I was so fastened to mine Engine that I durst slumber enough to serve my turn, which I took with as great ease, as if I had lain on the best Down-Bed in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>After eleven days passage in this violent flight, I perceived we began to approach to another Earth
<PB N="81" REF="44">
(if I may so call it) being the Globe or very Body of that Star which we call the Moon. The first dif|ference I found between this and our Earth was, that it appeared in its natural colours, as soon as ever I was free from the attraction of the Earth; Whereas with us, a thing a League or two from us puts on that deadly colour of Blew. I then percei|ved also that this World was the greatest part covered with a huge mighty Sea, those parts only being dry Land which are to us somewhat darker than the rest of her Body, I mean, what the Coun|trey people call, <HI>The Man in the Moon,</HI> and that part which shines so bright is another Ocean besprinkled with Islands, which for their smalness we cannot discern so far off; So that the Splendor which ap|pears to us in the Night, is nothing but the re|flection of the Sun beams returned to us out of the Water as from a Lookinglass. How much this dis|agrees with what our Philosophers teach in the Schools is evident; But alas how many of their Errors hath time and experience refuted in this our Age, and among other vain conjectures, who hath not hitherto believed the upper Region of the Air to be very hot; as being next, forsooth, to the natural place of the Element of Fire; Meer Vanities, Fancies and Dreams; For after I was once free from the attractive Beams of that Tyra|nous Load stone the Earth, I found the Air alto|gether serene, without Winds, Rain, Mists or Clouds, neither hot nor cold, but constantly plea|sant, calm and comfortable till my arrival in that <HI>New World of the Moon;</HI> As for that Region of fire our Philosophers talk of, I heard no news of it, mine eyes have sufficiently inform'd me there is no such thing.</P>
<P>The Earth had now by turning about shewed me all her parts twelve times when I finished my course; For when by my reckoning it seem'd to be (as in|deed it was) <HI>Tuesday September</HI> 11. at which time
<PB N="82" REF="45">
the Moon being two days old was in the twentieth degree of <HI>Libra)</HI> my <HI>Gansa's</HI> seem'd by one consent to stay their course, and rested for certain hours, after which they took their flight, and in less than an hour set me on the top of an high Hill in that <HI>Other World,</HI> where many wonderful things were presented to my sight. For I observed first, that though the Globe of the Earth appear'd much greater there than the Moon doth to us, even three times bigger, yet all things there were ten, twenty, yea thirty times larger than ours; Their Trees were thrice as high, and above five times broader and thicker; So were their Herbs, Birds, and Beasts, though I cannot well compare them to ours, be|cause I found not any kind of Beast or Bird there which any way resembled ours, except Swallows, Nightingals, Cuckoes, Woodcocks, Batts, and some kiad of Wild Fowl; And likewise such Birds as my <HI>Gansa's,</HI> all which as I now perceived, spend their time in their absence from us, in that World, neither do they differ in any thing from ours, but are the very same kind.</P>
<P>No sooner was I upon the ground, but I found my self extream hungry; stepping then to the next Tree I fastned my Engine and <HI>Gansa</HI>'s thereto, and in great hast fell to examining my Pockets for the Victuals I had reserved there; but to my great sur|prize and vexation, instead of Partridges and Ca|pons, which I thought I had hoarded there, I found nothing but a medley of dry leaves, Goats Hair, Sheep or Goats Dung, Moss, and the like; my Canary-wine was turned, and stunk like Hors-piss; Oh the villany and cheats of these cursed Spirits, whose assistance if I had depended on, in what a condition had I been! while I stood musing at this strange Metamorphosis, on a sudden I heard my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s fluttering behind me, and looking back, I spied them falling greedily upon a Shrub within the reach of their lines, whose leaves they fed ear|nestly
<PB N="83" REF="45">
upon, whereas before I had never seen them eat any green thing whatever; so stepping to the Shrub, I put a leaf to my Mouth; the tast was so excellent, that I cannot express it, and if I had not with discretion moderated my Appetite, I should have surfeited thereon, yet it happened to be a good bait both for me and my Birds, when we had most need of refreshment.</P>
<P>Scarce had we ended our Banquet, when I saw my self surrounded with a strange kind of People both in feature, manners, and apparel; their Sta|ture was very different, but they were generally twice as high as ours; their shape and countenance pleasant, and their habit hardly to be describ'd; for I never saw either Cloth, Silk, nor other Stuff, like that whereof their Cloths were made; neither can I possibly relate their colour, they being in a manner all clothed alike; it was neither Black, White, Yellow, Red nor Blue, nor any colour composed of these; If you ask what was it then, I must tell you, it was a colour never seen in our Earthly World, and so neither to be described nor conceived by us; for as it is hard to make a man born b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ind understand the difference between Green and Blue, so neither can I decipher this Moon colour, as having no affinity with any I ever beheld; I can only say it was the most glorious and delightful that can be imagined, neither was any thing more pleasant to me during my stay there.</P>
<P>Being surprized at the appearance of these Peo|ple so suddenly and in such accoutrements, I cros|sed my self and cry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d out, <HI>Iesu Maria;</HI> No sooner was the word <HI>Iesu</HI> pronounced, but young and old fell all on their knees (whereat I not a little re|joiced) holding up their hands on high, and re|peating certain words which I understood not; And presently rising again, one much taller than the rest came and kindly imbraced me, and orde|ring as I perceived, some of the rest to attend my
<PB N="84" REF="46">
Birds, he took me by the hand, and led me to his dwelling down toward the foot of the Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, which was a building so great and beautiful, as nothing in our World is comparable thereto; Yet afterward I saw such as this seem'd but a Cottage in respect of them; There was no Door about the House less than thirty Foot high, and twelve broad, the Rooms were forty or fifty Foot in height, and ans|werable in proportion; neither could they be much less, the Master thereof being full twenty eight high, and I suppose his Body would weigh twenty five or thirty of ours; After I had rested with him about one of our days&punc; he led me five Leagues off to the Palace of the Prince of the Coun|trey&punc; the stateliness whereof I have not now leis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">re to describe; This Prince was much taller than the former, and called (as neer as I can by letters de|clare it, for their sounds are not perfectly to be ex|prest by our Characters,) <HI>Pyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> which in their Language is <HI>First</HI> or <HI>Chief,</HI> if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t doth not rather de|note his Authority and Dignity, as being the prin|cipal man in all those parts; Though yet there is one Supream Monarch amongst them, much grea|ter of stature than he, comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g over all that whole World, having under him twenty nine other Princes of great Power; and every one of these has twenty four Inferior Governours, whereof this <HI>Pylonas</HI> was one. The first Ancestor of this great Monarch came out of the Earth, as they relate, and by marrying the Heiress of that vast Monarchy obtaining the government, left it to his Posterity, who have enjoyed it ever since, even forty thou|sand Moons, which is 3077 years; His name was <HI>Irdonozur</HI> whose Heirs to this day assume the same name; he, they say, having continued there about four hundred Moons, and begot divers Children, return'd (though by what means they know not) to the Earth again. I doubt they have their Fa|bles as well as we, since our Historians never men|tion
<PB REF="46">
any Earthly Man to have been in that World before my self, and much less to have return'd again. I cannot therefore but condemn this tradition as false and Romantick, though I found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">earning was in great esteem among them, and they seem to detest Lying and Falshood which is there severely punished, and which may yield some credit to their Historical Narrations. Many of them live wonder|ful long, even beyond belief, affirming to me that some survived thirty thousand Moons, which is above a thousand years, so that the Ages of three or four men might easily reach to the time of the first <HI>Irdonozur,</HI> and this is generally noted that the taller people are of Stature, the more excellent are their endowments of mind, and the longer time they live; for their stature is very different, great numbers not much exceeding ours, who seldom live above a thousand Moons, which is fourscore of our years; these they account base, unworthy crea|tures, but one degree above brute Beasts, and im|ploy in mean and Servile Offices, calling them Bastards, Counterfeits or Changlings; Those whom they account true <HI>Natural Lunars</HI> or <HI>Moon Men,</HI> ex|ceed ours generally thirty times, both in quantity of Body, and length of life, proportionable to the quality of the day in both Worlds, theirs contai|ning almost thirty of our days</P>
<P>The manner of our travel to the Palace of <HI>Pylonas</HI> was more strange and incredible than any thing we have related, for at our first setting forth there were delivered to each of us two Feather Fans like those our Ladies in <HI>Spain</HI> cool themselves with in Sum|mer; You must understand that the Globe of the Moon has likewise an attractive power, yet so much weaker than the Earth, that if a man do but spring upward with all his strength, as Dancers do in shew|ing their Tricks, he will be able to mount fifty or sixty foot high; and being then above all attracti|on from the Moons Earth, he falls down no more,
<PB REF="47">
but by the help of these Fans as with Wings, they convey themselves in the Air in a short space, (though not quite so swift as Birds) whither they please. In two hours time (as I could guess) by the help of these Fans we were carried through the Air those five Leagues, in all about sixty Persons. Being arrived at the Palace of <HI>Pylonas,</HI> after our Conductor had declared what manner of Present he had brought, I was called in to him by his At|tendants; By the Stateliness of his Palace and the reverence done him, I soon perceived his great|ness, and managed my affairs in order to procure his favour accordingly, and having, as you may remember, a certain little Box or Casket of Jewels, the remainder of those I brought from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> before I was introduced I secretly took them out of my pocket, and chusing some of each sort.

<P>I found him sitting in a magnificent Chair of State with his Wife or Queen on one hand, and his Eldest Son on the other, one attended by a Troop of Ladies, and the other of young men, and all along the side of the Room stood a great number of handsom Personages, whereof scarce one was lower of Stature than <HI>Pylonas,</HI> whose Age they re|port is now one and twenty thousand Moons. At my entrance I fell on my knees, and taking out my Jewels, I presented to the King seven Stones of se|veral sorts, a Diamond, a Ruby, an Emerald, a Saphire, a Topaz and an Opal, which he accept|ed with Joy and admiration. Then I offered the Queen and Prince some others, and design'd to have bestow'd divers more upon his Attendants, but <HI>Pylonas</HI> forbid them to accept any, supposing, as I heard, they were all I had, which he would have me reserve for <HI>Irdonozur</HI> his Soveraign; He then imbraced me with much indearedness, and inqui|red divers things by signs, which I answered in the

<P>Being dismist I was provided with all necessaries as my heart could wish, so that I seem'd to be in a Paradise, the pleasures whereof did not yet so trans|port me, but I was much concerned with the thoughts of my Wife and Children, and still retaining some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to them I tended my <HI>Gansa</HI>'s daily with much care; which yet had signified little if other men had not done more than I could; For now the time came when of necessity all people of our Stature, and my self likewise, must needs sleep thirteen or fourteen whole days together; for by a secret and irresistible decree of nature when the day begins to appear, and the Moon to be enlightned by the Sun Beams which is in the first Quarter of the Moon, all people of our Stature inhabiting these parts fall into a dead sleep, and are not possibly to be wakened till the Sun set; and is withdrawn; for as Owls and Bats with us cannot indure the light, so at the first approach of day we begin to be amazed therewith, and fall into a slumber, which grows by degrees into a dead sleep till the light be gone, which is in fourteen or fifteen days, that is till the last Quarter. During the Suns absence, there is a twofold light, one of
<PB N="88" REF="48">
the Sun which I could not endure to behold, and another of the Earth; Now that of the Earth was at the height, for when the Moon is at the change, then is the Earth a full Moon to them, and as the Moon increaseth with us, so the light of the Earth decreaseth with them. I found the light, though the Sun was absent, equal to that with us in the day when the Sun is clouded; but toward the quarter it dayly diminisheth, yet leaving still a competent light, which seems very strange; though not so re|markable as what they there report, that in the other Hemisphere of the Moon, contrary to that I fell upon, where during half the Moon they see not the Sun, and the Earth never appears to them, they have yet a kind of light not unlike our Moon light, which it seems the neerness of the Stars and other Planets that are at a far less distance than from us, affords them.</P>
<P>You must understand that of the <HI>true Lunars</HI> or <HI>Moon men</HI> there are three kinds, some a little taller than we, as perhaps ten or twelve Foot high, these can indure the day of the Moon, when the Earth shines but little, but not the Beams of both, and so must then be laid asleep; Others are twenty Foot high or above, who can suffer all the light both of the Earth and Sun. There are in a certain Island (the mysteries whereof are carefully concealed) men whose Stature is at least twenty seven Foot high; If any other come a land there in the Moons day time, they instantly fall asleep; This is called <HI>In|sula Martini,</HI> and hath a particular Governour, who as they report is sixty five thousand Moons old, which makes five thousand of our years, his name is said to be <HI>Hirach,</HI> and be in a manner commands <HI>Irdonozur</HI> himself, especially in that Island out of which he never removes; There is another comes often thither, who they say is not above half his Age, that is about thirty three thousand Moons, or two thousand six hundred of our years, and he

<P>Now let me settle my self to a long nights sleep, to which end my Attendants take charge of my Birds, prepare my lodging, and signifie to me by signs how I must order my self. It was then about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> when I perceived the Air more clear than ordinary, and with the increase of the light I began to feel my self first dull and then heavy to sleep, though I had not been lately disturb'd of my rest; At length I delivered my self into the custody of this Sister of Death, whose Prisoner I was for almost a Fortnight after, and then awaking, it is not to be believed how brisk and vigorous I found the faculties both of my Body and Mind; I then applyed my self to learning the Language,, which is the same throughout all the Regions of the Moon, yet not so wonderful, since I believe all the Earth of Moon does not amount to the fortieth part of our inhabited Earth, partly because the Globe of the Moon is far less, and be|sides the Sea or Ocean covers very nigh three parts of four, whereas the Land and Sea in our World may be judged of an equal measure. Their Language is very difficult, since it hath no Affinity with any other I ever heard, and consists not so much of Words and Letters as Tunes and strange sounds which no Letters can express, for there are few words but signifie several things, and are distingui|shed only by their Sounds, which are sung as it were in uttering; yea many words consist of tunes only without words; By occasion whereof I find a Language may be framed, and easily learned, as copious as any other in the World only of Tunes which is an Experiment worth searching after; Notwithstanding these difficulties within two

months I attained to such knowledge therein that I understood most Questions demanded of me, and with signs and words made reasonable shift to ut|ter my mind; which <HI>Pylonas</HI> having notice of, he oftimes sent for me, and was pleased to inform me of many things my Guardians durst not disclose, though I must needs say I never found they abused me with an untruth, but if I asked a question they were unwilling to resolve, they would shake their heads, and with a <HI>Spanish</HI> shrug divert to some other discourse.</P>
<P>After seven Months time the great <HI>Irdonozur</HI> ma|king his Progress to a place about two hundred Leagues from the Palace of <HI>Pylonas,</HI> sent for me, yet would not-admit me into his presence but dis|courst me through a Window where I might hear him, and he hear and see me at pleasure. I pre|sented him the remainder of my Jewels which he thankfully accepted, saying he would requite them with gifts of a far more considerable value. I stay'd there above a quarter of a Moon when I was again sent back to <HI>Pylonas,</HI> for if we had stay'd a day or two longer the Sun would have overtaken us before we could have recovered our home. The gifts he bestowed on me were such that a man would part with Mountains of Gold to purchase; they were all Stones, nine only in number, of three sorts, one called <HI>Poleastis,</HI> another <HI>Machrus,</HI> and the third <HI>Ebelus,</HI> of each sort 3. the first are about the big|ness of an Hazel-nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> very like Jet, which among many other incredible Virtues hath this property, that being once put in the Fire they ever after re|tain their heat, though without any outward ap|pearance, till quenched with some kind of liquor which no way endamages them though heated and cooled therein a thousand times; Their heat is so vehement that it will make any Metal within a foot of it red hot, and being in a Chimney warms the Room as if a great fire were kindled therein. The
<PB N="91" REF="49">
<HI>Machrus</HI> is yet more precious, in colour like a <HI>To|paz,</HI> so clear and resplendent as though not above the bigness of a Bean, yet being placed in the night in the midst of a large Church it makes all as light as if an hundred Lamps were hanged round; can any man wish for more useful properties in a Stone than these? Yet my <HI>Ebelus</HI> is so excellent that it may be much prefer'd before them, yea prized above all the Diamonds, Saphires, Rubies, and Eme|ralds that our World can afford. The <HI>Lunar</HI> co|lour is so exceeding beautiful that a man would travel a thousand Leagues to behold it, the Shape is somewhat flat, of the breadth of a peice of Eight, and twice the thickness, one side is of a more Ori|ent colour than the other, which being clapt to a mans bare Skin, takes away all the weight and pon|derousness of his Body, but turning the other side, it adds force to the attractive beams of the Earth either in this World or that, and makes the body half as heavy again; Do you wonder now why I should so overprize this stone? before you see me on Earth again, you will find I have reason to va|lue this invaluable Jewel. I inquired whether they had not any kind of Jem, or other means to make a man invisible, which I judged a thing of admira|ble use, and could mention divers of our learned men who had written to this purpose; They ans|wered, that if it were possible, yet they were sure Heaven would not suffer it to be revealed to us crea|tures subject to so many imperfections, and which might be easily abused to ill purposes, and this was all I could get of them.</P>
<P>Now after it was known that <HI>Irdonozur</HI> the great Monarch had done me this honour, it is strange how much all respected me more than before; my Guardians who had been hitherto cautious in re|lating any thing of the Government of that World, grew now more open, so that from them and <HI>Pylo|nas</HI> together I understood many notable particu|lars;

As that in a thousand years there is found neither Thief nor Whore-Monger, for first there is no want of any thing necessary for the use of man, food growing every where without labour, of all sorts that can be desired. As for Cloths, Houses, or whatever else a man may be suppos'd to want, it is provided by their Superiors, though not with|out some labour, but yet so easy as if they did it for pleasure; Again their Females are all absolute Beauties, and by a secret disposition of nature, a man there having once known a Woman never de|sires any other; Murther was never heard of amongst them, neither is it hardly po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">le to be committed, for there can be no wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> made but what is cureable; yea they assured me, and for my part I believe it, that though a mans head be out off, yet if within three Moons it be joined to the Carcass again, and the Juice of a certain Herb there growing applyed, it will be so consolidated as the wounded party shall be perfectly cured. But the chief cause of their good government is an excel|lent disposition in the nature of the People, so that all both Old and Young hate all manner of vice and live in such love, peace, and amity as it seems to be another Paradise; Though it is true likewise that some are of a better disposition than others, which they discern immediately at their Birth; And because it is an inviolable Law amongst them that none shall be put to death, therefore perceiving by their Stature or some other signs who are like to be of a wicked and deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ched humor, they send them, I know not by what means, into the Earth, and change them for other Children, before they have either opportunity or ability to do amiss among them; but first, they say, they are fain to keep them there for some time till the Air of the Earth alters their colour like ours.

<P>In this time by my own Industry, and the assistance of those who accompanied me, I learnt to speak indifferently the Language of that Province, (for almost every Province in <HI>China</HI> hath its pro|per Tongue) whereat I perceived they were much pleased; At length I was permitted to take the Air, and brought into the spacious Garden of that Pallace, a place of extraordinary pleasure and de|light, adorned with Herbs and Flowers of admira|ble sweetness and beauty, with almost infinite va|riety of Fruits, <HI>European</HI> and others, all composed with that rare curiosity as even ravished my senses in the contemplation of such delightful objects; I had not long recreated my self here, when the <HI>Man|darin</HI> entred the Garden on that side I was walking, of which having notice by his Servants, and that I ought to kneel to him (a usual reverence I found toward great Officers) I did so, and humbly intrea|ted his favour toward a poor stranger who arrived in these parts not designedly but by the secret dis|posal of the Heavens; He answered in a different Language which I hear all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> use, and like that of the <HI>Lunars</HI> consisting chiefly of tunes, which was interpreted by one of his Attendants, wishing me to be of good comfort since he inten|ded no harm to me.

<P>The strangeness of my story did much amaze him, and finding in all my discourse nothing ten|ding to Magick, wherein he hoped by my means to be instructed, he began to admire the excellency of my Wit, applauding me for the happiest man that this World ever saw, and wishing me to re|pose my self after my long Narration, he for that time dismissed me.

These Salvages had the Cattel we bought of them at very great Command, for with a call they would presently run to them, and when they had sold a Bullock to us for a little piece of Brass, if we did not presently knock him down, they would by the same call make the poor creature break from us, and run to them again, and then there was no getting them, but by giving more Brass; thus they sell the same beast two or three times, by the covetousness and deceit of this brutish People.

<P>For generally all People as well Heathen as Christian acknowledge the great God of Heaven and Earth, but they, as <HI>Cooree</HI> told us, own no God at all; Their speech seems rather an inarticu|late noise than a Language, like the clucking of Hens, or Gabling of Turkies, sounding like the word Hott-en-tot, from whence they are so called. As they walk about, they make a strange confused noise; if there be two, three, ten, twenty or more in company, they walk in rank one after another in small paths they have made by going thus, as Cows do when they come home to the pail; or as Wild Geese flying in Ranks, make a noise, so these walking together gabble from the first to the last as if all spake and none answered; Their Habits are Sheep Skins undrest thonged together, which cover their bodies to the middle, with a little flap tyed before them, being naked downward; when it is cold they put the Woolley, and when hot the Fleshy side next their Body. Their Ornaments are Bullocks or Sheeps guts full of Excrements about their Necks; and when we bought their Cattel they would take, their Skins, Guts, and Garbage, which plentifully furnish't them with that stinking attire; When they are hungry they sit down and shaking some of that filthy pudding out of the Guts bow down their Mouths to their hands almost as low as their knees, and like hungry Dogs gnaw and eat the Raw Guts.</P>

A couple of them, had found on the Shoar a large peice of a dead Fish the Sea had cast up, which stunk intolerably; they made a little fire with dry Cow-dung warmd and then eat it, with as much appetite as an hungry man would feed upon a Savoury Dish; which makes one believe they have but three senses, wanting both smelling and tasting.

<P>Though the <HI>English East-India</HI> Company declined raising a Fort, or settling a Colony at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> have Built a Strong Fort there by the Sea side, against the Harbour, where the Governour lives. And about 300 pa~ces distant on the West of the Fort is a small <HI>Dutch</HI> Town of about 60 Houses low, but well Built with Stone Walls, from a Quarry close by. The Countrey, for near an 100 Mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> up, is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">etty well setled with Farms, and yeilds good Crops of Wheat.

There are great quantities of Grapes, of which the <HI>French</HI> make excellent white wine, of a pale yellow colour but sweet, pleasant and strong. There are also Cows, Goats, Hogs, Horses, and Sheep very large and fat. Ducks, Geese, Hens and Turkeys are very numerous; So are Ostriches, who lay their Eggs in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd, one of which will very well suffice 2 men.

On the backside of the Town towards the moun|tains the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Company have a large House, and a Garden, 3 mile long incompassed with a high Stone Wall; full of divers sorts of Herbs, Flowers, Roots, and Fruits; with spacious Gravel Walks and Arbours; watered with a Brook which descends from the Mountains and being cut into many Channells is conveyed into all parts of the Garden. This water is afterward in Pipes carried into the Sea so far, that a Longboat may come un|der the Pipe, which is raised to some height, and by turning a Cock will fill all the Casks with fresh water&punc; with the greatest conveniency; and is the best Watering Place in the World. The Hedges that make the Walks of this Garden are very thick, and 9 or 10 foot high; They are kept heat and even by continual pruning; They keep each sort of Fruit by themselves, as Apples, Pears, Pomogranats, and abundance of Quinces, all which thrive well. The Roots and Garden Herbs have also their dis|tinct places, hedged in apart, which makes the whole extream pleasant and beautiful. Great num|bers of <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves are continually weeding and working therein. All Strangers are allowed liber|ty to walk there, but not to tast of the fruit with|out leave.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> that live in the Town get well by the Ships that touch there. When the Men come ashoar to refresh themselves they must give <HI>3s</HI> or a Dollar a day for their entertainment, tho' Bread and Flesh is as cheap here as in <HI>England.</HI> Besides, they buy good penniworths of several Commodities from Seamen, which they sell again to the Countrey Farmers at a dear rate; none of which live within 20 Miles of the Harbour. The high Tax that the Company lays upon drink makes it very dear. There are but 3 Houses in the Town that sell strong liquor; One, where they sell only Wine, and you must buy no where else but by stealth, the Vintner pay|ing

<P><HI>Gambroon,</HI> or <HI>Gomrow,</HI> is a City of great Com|merce, guarded with 2 Castles, wherein are plant|ed 80 Brass Cannon.

<HEAD>The Religion of the <HI>Persians.</HI> With the Life and Doctrines of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Grand Im|postor.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Persians</HI> are generally <HI>Mahometans</HI> of the <HI>Sophian</HI> Sect, and the difference and ha|tred is so great between them and the <HI>Turks,</HI> though both own <HI>Mahomet</HI> for their Law-giver, that they are absolutely irreconcileable. Now because this horrible Impostor has infatuated so great a part of the World with his blasphemous Dotages, I will here give a breif Account of his Life, and also of his Doctrine, as it is comprehended in his <HI>Holy Book&punc;</HI> as they call it, or the <HI>Alcoran</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mahomet,</HI> the Son of <HI>Abdalla,</HI> an Idolatrous <HI>Pa|gan,</HI> was born after his Fathers death, at <HI>Ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hrip,</HI> an obscure Village of <HI>Arabia Foelix;</HI> but now be|come a City called <HI>Medina Talnahi,</HI> or the Town of the Prophet, to which a multitude of <HI>Mahome|tans</HI> go in Pilgrimage every Year. His Mother, named <HI>Hemina,</HI> was a perverse Jewess both by Birth and Religion, who dying when he was but 2 Years old, left him to the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e of his Uncle <HI>Abdal Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">alib.</HI> He, unable to give him any other Edu|cation than the Irreligion and Ignorance of his Countrey afforded him, sold him at 10 Years of Age to the <HI>Ishmaelites,</HI> after the barbarous Cu|stoms of the <HI>Arabians;</HI> who exposing him to Sale in the open Market, he was bought by one <HI>Abdal</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> wealthy Merchant; By him he was imployed as a Slave in all Servile Offices, till observing his great Wit, and fitness for better Services, he at last used him as his Factor, sending him with his Camels and Loads of Merchandize into <HI>Syria, Persia, Egypt,</HI> and
<PB N="122" REF="65">
other places, wherein he behaved himself with such dexterity that he much increased his Masters Wealth, and his own Estimation; Of Person he is said to be low, and withal Scald-headed, but other|wise comely, and of good aspect; Much troubled with the Falling sickness, which Infirmity he made good use of afterward, affirming those Fits were no|thing but heavenly Raptures in which he conversed with the Angel <HI>Gabriel;</HI> He is likewise said to have been well Skill'd in Magick, by which he taught a white Pigeon to feed at his Ear, which he declared was the Holy Ghost, by whom he was instructed in the Law he was to publish; but this not till after|wards; By Sorcerie, comeliness of Person, and the great knowledge he had in his Masters business, he gained so far on the Affections of his Mistriss, that upon the death of <HI>Abdal</HI> she made him her Hus|band.</P>
<P>Possessed of all his Masters Wealth, he affected Ease, and being till then of no Religion, or at least a Pagan, he began to hearken to <HI>Sergius</HI> a <HI>Nesto|rian</HI> Monk, who flying out of <HI>Syria</HI> for fear of pu|nishment (the Heresies of <HI>Nestorius</HI> being new|ly both revived and censured) came into <HI>Arabia,</HI> where he found Entertainment in the House of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> By his perswasions, who found him a fit Instrument for the Devil to work on, he began to entertain thoughts of hammering out a new Re|ligion which might unite all Parties in some com|mon Principles, and bring the <HI>Christians, Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> into which the World was then divided, under one Profession; Resolv'd on this, he retir'd to a Cave not far from <HI>Mecca,</HI> as if he there at|tended only Contemplation; <HI>Sergius</HI> in the mean time Trumpeting in the Ears of the People both his Parts and Piety; who being thus prepared to behold the Pageant, out comes the principal Actor, with some parts of his <HI>Alcoron,</HI> pleasing enough to sensual Minds, which he professed to have received
<PB N="123" REF="65">
from the Angel <HI>Gabriel;</HI> And finding that this edi|fied to his Expectation, he next proclaimed Liber|ty&punc; to all Slaves and Servants, as a thing command|ed him by God, by whom the natural Liberty of Mankind was most dearly tendred; which drew to him such a Rabble of unruly People, that without Fear or Opposition he dispersed his Doctrines, re|ducing them at last to a Book, or Method. The Book of this Religion he calleth the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> or <HI>Col|lestion of Precepts,</HI> the Original whereof they feign is written on a Table kept in Heaven, and the Co|py brought to <HI>Mahomet</HI> by the Angel <HI>Gabriel.</HI> A Book so highly reverenced by the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> that they write upon the Cover of it, <HI>Let none touch this but he that is clean.</HI> The Body of it, as it now standeth, was Composed by <HI>Osman,</HI> the fourth <HI>Ca|liph</HI> or Governour; who seeing the <HI>Saracens</HI> daily inclining to divers Heresies by reason of some false Copies of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Law, and that the Empire, by the same means, was likely to fall into civil dis|sention, by the help of his Wife, who was <HI>Maho|met</HI>'s Daughter, he got a sight of all <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Pa|pers, which he reduced into four Volumes, and divided it into 124 Chapters; commanding expresly, upon pain of death, that that Book, and that on|ly should be received as Canonical through his Do|minions; The whole body of it being only a Gloss and Exposition on Eight of the Commandments.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Every one ought to believe, that God is a great God, and one only God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet.</HI> They hold <HI>Abraham</HI> to be the Friend of God, <HI>Moses</HI> the Messenger of God, and Christ the Breath of God, whom they deny to be conceived of the Holy Ghost, affirming, that the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> grew with Child of him by smelling to a Rose, and was delivered of him at her Breasts; They deny the Mistery of the Trinity, but punish such as speak against Christ, whose Religion was not, say they, taken away, but amended by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and

whoever in his Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca</HI> doth not visit the Sepulchre of Christ either going or coming is reputed not to have merited or bettered himself by his Journey.</P>

Four Wives he allows to every Man, and as many Concubines as he will, between whom the Husband makes no difference either in Affecti|on or Apparel, but that the first Wife only enjoys his Sabbath days Benevolence; The Women are not admitted while alive into their Churches, nor after death into Paradise; And whereas in most o|ther Countries Fathers give some Portions with their Daughters, the <HI>Mahometans</HI> give Money for their Wives, which being once paid, the Contract is Registred in the <HI>Cadies</HI> Book, and this is all their formality of Marriage.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Every one must give of his Wealth to the Poor.</HI> Hence some buy Slaves and set them free, others buy Birds and let them fly; They use commonly to release Prisoners and Bond-slaves; To build Caves or Lodgings in the ways for relief of Passengers; Repair Bridges and mend High-ways; But their most ordinary Alms consists in Sacrifices of Sheep and Oxen, which, when the Solemnity is per|form'd, they distribute amongst the Poor, to whom also on the first Day of every Year, they are bound to give the Tyth or Tenth part of their Profits the Year past, so that there are scarce any Beggars a|mong them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Every one must make his Prayers five times a Day.</HI> When they pray they turn their Bodies to|wards <HI>Mecca,</HI> but their Faces sometimes one way, and sometimes another, believing that <HI>Mahomet</HI> shall come behind them while at their Devotions. The first time is an hour before Sun rising, the se|cond at Noon-day, the third at three a Clock Af|ternoon&punc; the fourth at Sun-setting, the fifth and last before they go to sleep; At all these times the
<PB N="125" REF="66">
Cryers bawl in the Steeples (for the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Sa|racens</HI> have no Bells) for the People to come to Church, and such as cannot, must, when they hear the Voice of the Cryers, fall down in the place where they are, do their Devotions, and kiss the Ground thrice.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Every one must keep a Lent one month in a Year.</HI> This Lent is called <HI>Ramazan,</HI> in which they suppose the <HI>Alcoran</HI> was given to <HI>Mahomet</HI> by the Angel <HI>Gabriel.</HI> This Fast is only in the day time, their Law allowing them to be as Frolick in the Night as they please; so they abstain from Wine and Swines Flesh, which is prohibited in their Law at all times, but never so strictly abstained from as in Lent.</P>

Secondly, They sometimes hoise up their Heels, and with a great Cudgel give them three or four hundred blows on the soles of their Feet. Thirdly, It is ordinary to draw them na|ked up to the top of a Gibbet or Tower full of Hooks, and cutting the Ropes to let them fall down again, and by the way they are caught by some of the Hooks, where they commonly hang till they die for Hunger.</P>

The Men shall never exceed the Age of Thirty, nor the Wo|men of Fifteen, and those to have their Virgini|ties renew'd as oft as lost. <HI>Friday</HI> he ordained to be their Sabbath, partly to distinguish his Follow|ers from the <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> who solemnize the 2 days ensuing; but principally because he was on that day proclaimed King, or Emperor, and so accordingly created; Wine and Swines Flesh are the principal things forbidden by the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> from the last whereof they all unanimously refrain, but on the first they are so besotted, that when they come at it they seldom go home again un|led; insomuch that all the Wines in <HI>Constantinople</HI> have been thrown about the Streets, and death made the Penalty for any who shall presume to bring any more into the City; <HI>Mahomet</HI> taught them, that every one should be saved by his own Religion, except those who revolt from the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to another Law; But so that under the Notion of Religion h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> means only such as worship the One and only God, excluding thereby the Old Gentile Idolaters from the hope of Salvation.

He was, as himself confessed, altogether Unlearned, and tho&punc; naturally Subtile and Witty, yet often puzzled to invent Miracles to confirm the deluded <HI>Arabians</HI> in their vain Belief. For he contidually Preaching to them, that God sent him to confirm his Law by force of Arms, the People earnestly demanded some Sign of his Mission; so he was constrained to amuse them with the story of a Voyage which he made to Heaven, to this effect.</P>
<P>That the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> with 70 pair of Wings came to him by Night, as he was in Bed with his Wife, saying, <HI>That God had sent for him.</HI> He going down with this Angel, found at his Door an Hete|rogeneous Beast, called <HI>Elborach,</HI> half Ass, half Mule, but much swifter than either; for it would go as far at one step as the most quick-sighted Man could see. This Beast (or <HI>Mahumetan)</HI> would not let <HI>Mahomet</HI> mount him, unless he would first pro|mise to pray for him, which the charitable Prophet did; and was then, in the twinkling of an Eye, brought by him to <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> where the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> tyed the Beast with his Girdle to a Rock; and taking <HI>Mahomet</HI> on his shoulders, carried him to Heaven Gate&punc; They knockt, and the Porter understanding <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be there, instantly open|ed, and bid him welcome. In the first Heavens he saw Angels of divers and monstrous shapes; some composed of Fire and Snow; others of Fire alone, every one of a different Form. Among the rest, one with the Head of a Cock, whose Feet trod upon one Heaven, and his Head toucht ano|ther; each Heaven being so far distant, that it was a Journey of 500 Years to pass from one to the o|ther; and when this Cock Crows, which it seems
<PB N="131" REF="69">
is his language, all the Cocks upon the Earth Crow likewise. This Angel conveyed him to another, he to a third, and so from one to another, till at length he came to the Heaven where God himself was; who courteously received him, asking how his people did and whether they received his Law. God then familiarly lay'd his hand upon his Shoul|der, which was so cold that it peirced the marrow of his back bone. He was soon dismist, God tel|ling him only how often in a day his Disciples should make their Prayers; which were so many that in his return to the fourth Heaven, <HI>Moses</HI> met him, advising him to go back, and intreat God that fewer prayers might serve his turn, since his Followers were not able to say so many; so at length the number was reduced to five. He then went back to his <HI>Elborach,</HI> which in a moment brought him home to his house in <HI>Mecca,</HI> where he went to bed again to his wife; she not once dreaming her husband would leave Heaven for her company, or imagining he had been there; all this he perfor|med in the tenth part of a night.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> do still believe this Romantick story for truth, but the <HI>Arabians</HI> at that time, requiring him to ascend again to Heaven in their view, he unwilling to take so long a Journey only replyed, Praised be God that I am a Man, and an Apostle. On the Seal which he used was ingraven, <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Messenger of God. He had several slights to deceive his Followers, performed either by Art or Witchcraft. Once an Ox brought him a Chap|ter of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> upon his Horns in a full Assembly. Another time being at dinner with one that was his pretended freind, who yet designed to poyson him, and a Shoulder of Mutton being brought to Table, he pretended the meat spoke, and forbid him to eat of it, tho' none but himself heard it among a great Company; however he permitted one of his dearest freinds to eat, and dye, poysoned
<PB N="132" REF="70">
therewith. Other vain Miracles he published, as that the Trees bowed to him, (tho' only shaken by a sudden gust of wind) the Wolves howled, and the Asses brayed to him, all in their several Langua|ges desiring his Prayers, which he being a Prophet understanding, as religiously performed. He often declared that God gave him Commission to fulfil his own desires in all things, and in his <HI>Alcoran</HI> writes, that he thus spake to him, O Prophet! it is permitted thee to lye with all Women that are given thee, or which thou dost purchase; thy Aunts, or kindred, and all other good Women that freely desire thy Company, and this is lawful for thee alone. Thus he pretended Religion for fulfilling his inordinate Lusts, in which it is say'd he equalled his strength to that of 40 men.</P>
<P>The day of his Death was no less prodigious then the course of his life, a Comet resembling a Sword, appearing at high noon, pointing from South to North, and continued in the sight of all for thirty days together, which the Wise men of that Age concluded to be a Presage of the fatal riseing and grandeur of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Empire. <HI>Haly</HI> was astonisht at his distemper, and the high frenzy wherein he dyed, esteeming it no divine quality in a Prophet and a Redeemer (as he called himself) of so many People. He derided his presumption, yet carefully concealed the manner of his death, being willing to promote his Law, that so he might inherite his power and Empire.</P>
<P>For near 800 Years after his decease the <HI>Arabi|ans, Saracens, Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> continued in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith without any divisions. But in 1482. there happened this memorable alteration of Religion and State in <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> the Lawgiver of the <HI>Saracens</HI> by his last Will bequeathed to his Cosen <HI>Hali</HI> (who was also the Husband of his Daughter <HI>Fatime)</HI> all his Estate with the Title of <HI>Caliph;</HI> but <HI>Abubezar, Haumar</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="70">
and <HI>Osman,</HI> 3 powerful men of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and great Assistants to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> succeeded one another in that dignity. After their Death <HI>Hali</HI> hoped to obtain the Government which had so long been de|tained from him. But <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">avias,</HI> a valiant Souldier advanced himself, and to remove all future preten|sions, he slew <HI>Hali,</HI> with his Son <HI>Ossan,</HI> and eleven of <HI>Ossans</HI> Sons; but <HI>Musa Ceresin</HI> the twelsth Son made his escape; From this <HI>Musa</HI> one <HI>Guine Sophie</HI> derived his Pedigree in 1360. And considering that there had been no Caliphs for many Years past, he began to contrive the reviving and estab|lishing that Honourable Dignity in his own Fami|ly. He dying in the midst of his Projects, left the prosecution of them to his Son <HI>Aider Sophie,</HI> who being a man of great industry, sanctity, and power; and strenghtned with the love, and real affection of his people, <HI>Ussan Cassanes</HI> Prince of the <HI>Armeni|ans</HI> gave him his Daughter to Wife. But <HI>Iacup</HI> the Son and successor of <HI>Ussan</HI> after his fathers Death, envying the glory of <HI>Aider Sophie,</HI> and fea|ring his power, caused him to be slain, and deli|vered his 2 Sons which he had by <HI>Iacups</HI> Sister, named <HI>Ishmael</HI> and <HI>Solyman,</HI> to <HI>Amazor</HI> one of his Captains to secure them in prison. <HI>Amazor</HI> being of a generous temper, afforded them not only li|berty, but gave them ingenuous education.</P>
<P>Afterward <HI>Ismael</HI> the eldest, a Gentleman of pro|mising hopes, undertook to revenge the Death of his Father, which he likewise performed&punc; staying <HI>Iacup</HI> and his Son <HI>Elvan.</HI> After this Victory <HI>Ismael</HI> being crowned King, or <HI>Sophie,</HI> or <HI>Shaa</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> he altered the form of Religion there, declaring <HI>Hali</HI> and himself to be the only true Successors of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Prophet, and condemning <HI>Abubezer, Haumar</HI> and <HI>Osman,</HI> with the <HI>Turks</HI> their Abettors and Followers, as Usurpers, Rebels and Schisma|ticks; and ordered all Books to be Burnt, and all Monuments to be defaced that mentioned any

thing in honour of those 3 Caliphs. This difference in Religion hath created so mortal an aversion in them to each other, that the <HI>Turks</HI> hold it more meritorious to kill one <HI>Persian</HI> than 70 Christians.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Medina</HI> where <HI>Mahomet</HI> lyes buried is in <HI>Arabia,</HI> 3 days Journey from the Red Sea. His Tomb is inclosed within an Iron Grate, and covered with green Velvet, which is every year made New and sent by the Grand Seignior; the old one being by the Preists cut into small peices and sold at great Rates, as Reliques to the Pilgrims. In the Temple where this Tomb is placed, there are say'd to be 3000 Lamps of Gold and Silver, wherein is Balsome, and other rich odours, ointments and oils, continually kept burning. They would im|pose it for a Miracle that this Tomb should hang in the Air by means of Loadstones, but besides that there is no such thing, for it stands on the Floor, were it true, there were no such wonder in it. For <HI>Democrates</HI> the <HI>Atheniah</HI> by order of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> K. of <HI>Egypt,</HI> undertook to make the Statue of <HI>Arsinoe</HI> all of Iron, and to hang in the Air. And in the Temple of <HI>Serapis</HI> in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> there was an Iron Sun that hung in the Air by the force of a Load|stone, being a rare peice of Workmanship.</P>
<P>The Turks make a Pilgrimage to this Tomb, and all true Musselmen are obliged once in their Lives, at least, to go thither. To this purpose I will relate the following Story, from a late Travel|ler into <HI>Turkey.</HI> A <HI>Mahumitan</HI> having, in obedi|ence to a Religious Vow, undertaken this Journey, and being of the Opinion of the rest of his fellow Travellers (or the Caravan, as it is called) that they should meet with Water at a certain Well or Cistern upon the Road, had made use of the best part of their Provision, as the rest had done, upon the Ceremony of the Abdest or Ablution, which is their washing themseives before their Devotious, for they wash the best part of the Head and Neck;
<PB N="135" REF="71">
their Arms up to the Elbows, their Feet, the end of the Priapus, and the Posterior Orifice. And for this Reason they never erect any Mosquee, or Church, without planting Fountains round about it, for they firmly believe, that their Prayers put up without these Washings, and in a state of Im|purity, would rather draw down the Wrath of Heaven upon them than procure the blessings of God. And indeed these severe Commands of wash|ing so often, are very troublesome, as well to those that live in dry places far from Water, as others in the Northern cold Climates; so that several <HI>Turks</HI> could wish heartily&punc; that they might be permitted to change their Religion, which ties them to so many inconvenient slabberings.</P>
<P>When these Pilgrims came to the Cistern where they hoped to be supplyed, they found the Water dryed up by the heat of the Sun. They were ex|treamly concerned thereat, finding themselves in the midst of the Sands, Deserts, and heats of <HI>Ara|bia.</HI> They knew not what course to take in that extremity of drowth which tormented them with Impatience; nor had many of them Money to buy Water of those who had been more provident, and indeed had not much to spare. Our poor <HI>Mahu|metan</HI> found himself reduced to endure a scorching drouth, and ready to be buried alive in the stifling Clouds of Sand which the Wind raises in that mise|rable Road. inspired him with more Execrations against <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his accursed Errors, tren the most zealous of the Eastern Christians could have invented for him. He said, <Q>He did not wish the Devil had taken <HI>Mahomet,</HI> for he did not believe him so unjust as to let that Impostor escape his Claws, who being the only cause of the death of so many Millions of people as perished in going to his Tomb, justly deserved as many deaths in Hell as he had caused poor Creatures to suffer tor|ments in this infamous cruel Pilgrimage; But he
<PB N="136" REF="72">
wisht with all his heart, That Heaven had Thun|derstruck from above, and that Hell had then swallowed in Flames the first contrive s of that accursed <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and the unfortunate Propogators of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or that he himself had been born a Christian.</Q></P>
<P>Some Christians in the Company were much sur|prized to hear a <HI>Mahometan</HI> thus blaspheme his own Religion, but they were told, That this Person was of a Sect who were neither <HI>Turks</HI> nor <HI>Christians,</HI> but a sort of <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Heretics.</P>
<P>When a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> has purified himself, he goes into the Church with his Eyes fixt upon the Ground, and barefoot. To which end the Eastern People have Shoes, or Slippers, of Goats Skins dyed Yel|low, Red, Violet, or Black, but none of them may wear them Green in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, this being the sacred colour which <HI>Mahomet</HI> so much af|fected; only their Emirs wear a Green Bonnet, which they put on with great reverence on their Heads; and is a mark of their being allied to their Great Prophet and Legislator.</P>
<P>But this is not regarded in <HI>Persia.</HI> as we may find by the following Story. <HI>Sha Abbas,</HI> the renowned K. of <HI>Persia,</HI> was the most accomplished Prince in all the East. It happened that a <HI>Turkish</HI> Ambassa|dor one time at his Court, being much concerned to see <HI>Christians</HI> as well as <HI>Mahometans</HI> wearing green Shoes and Trowses over all <HI>Persia,</HI> He&punc; in the name of his Master&punc; required the King to for|bid his Subjects any longer to prophane a Colour which all true <HI>Mahometans</HI> ought to have a greater Veneration for. That the King knew very well, that it being the Prophets peculiar Colour, it did not become the happy observers of his Law, to cover any part of the Body therewith, but only the Head; or at least the more decent part of the Body above the Wast; it being an insupportable Comtempt to trample under Foot a Colour so sacred, as his Sub|jects
<PB N="137" REF="72">
not only did, but also the <HI>Giaurs,</HI> or <HI>Christians,</HI> the <HI>Iews,</HI> and all other Infidels, and impure Na|tions in his Dominions. <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> perceived the folly of this Discourse, and so resolved to make a Jest of it. He made shew of consenting to the Grand Seigniors desire, and promised the Ambassa|dor that he would take Order his Subjects should no longer prophane the Prophets Colour, hoping the Grand Seignior would issue out the same Orders o|ver his Dominions. <Q>For, said the King, your Master beholds every day a greater prophanation of that Colour, and yet lets it go unpunished. My Subjects only wear the Colour dead upon their Shoes and Trowses, but all the Beasts in <HI>Turkey</HI> dung without any Penalty upon the Grass, which is the living Colour that <HI>Mahomet</HI> lov d. Therefore if he will prohibit all the Beasts in his Empire from defiling the green Grass with their Excrements, which they do continually, then will I take care that my Subjects shall wear green no longer.</Q>The Ambassador finding the Empe|ror did but deride his Folly, withdrew silently from the Presence, and left the <HI>Persians</HI> to their own liberty.</P>
<P>This washing and cleanliness of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> has occasion'd the building of several necessary Houses (which they call <HI>The Houses of Shame)</HI> for publick conveniency, which are kept very sweet, having a Cock to turn and take away all ill smells; so that you shall never see in all the East, the Walls of their Churches stain'd with Urine or Excrements, as in our parts of the World; Nor is any one prejudiced in his Health by retaining his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rtural Evacuations for want of convemency.</P>
<P>I never heard so many I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">vectives (saith a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman) as were uttered upon this account by a <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who had travelled to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and thence to <HI>Paris.</HI> He be|ing in <HI>France,</HI> used, according to the custom of his
<PB N="138" REF="73">
Countrey, to eat great plenty of Fruits, Salads, and, among the rest, Cucumbers half ripe, Stalks and all; a Diet enough to break a <HI>French</HI> Horses Belly, yet much admired by the Eastern People, whose D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">gestion tames it&punc; well enough. This <HI>Mahometan</HI> said, He found it hotter in <HI>Paris,</HI> during the heat of Summer, than at <HI>Damasco</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> tho' it lye 15 Degrees more to the South; so, to cool himself, he resolv'd to eat a great Dish of Milk and Cucumbers, and so to walk about half a Mile off where he had business. Returning back, the motion of his Body. the coldness of the Cu|cumbers, and the heat of the season, caused great commotion in the Bowels of the Musselman, and would by no means be appeased. He searched about for an House of Easement, yet could discover no|thing but open shops and throngs of people; He grew disconsolate, not knowing what course to take. He cursed all the streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> and wisht himself at <HI>Damascus,</HI> where is a great place walled in, containing 40 of these Necessary Houses. At last, in the height of his trouble, he thus lamented his Misfortunes, <Q>Were I now at <HI>Grand Cario,</HI> my pains would find redress by only bowing the head, and crying according to custom to Passengers, Pray Sir look another way; but here in <HI>Paris,</HI> where there are more people than stones in the street, what shall a Man do in my forlorn conditi|on? </Q> But these sad Complaints little availed, for before he could get to his Lodgings, the Cucum|bers forc'd their way open at his Back-door, and made the disconsolate <HI>Syrian</HI> know that Milk and Cucumbers was not so sweet as Milk and Honey, yet he must endure the smell as well as he made se|veral others, as he passed in that stinking pickle to his Lodgings to cleanse himself. This cleanliness of the <HI>Mahometans</HI> makes them call <HI>Christians</HI> Fil|thy, Unclean, and Nasty Infidels, or Unbelievers.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="73">
And thus much for this Grand Impastor <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whom Heaven permitted to be a scourge for pu|nishing the Christians; who, at that time, had forsaken the Doctrines of the Gospel, and had im|braced damnable Herisies. Let this excite us to bless the goodness of God, who enjoy the glorious Light of his Truth; and to admire Gods Judg|ments, who suffers so many large Kingdoms and Countries to be infatuated, deluded, and inslaved; and so many Millions of people to be abused by that false Prophet, and to believe his Lyes, Non|sense and Blasphemy. He belies God in making him the Author of his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> boasting that his Name is written upon the Throne of God, and that he is the greatest of the Prophets, having more knowledge than all the Men and Angels in the World. He belies Jesus Christ, in saying he could not be Gods Son, because God was never Married, as if there were no other way of Generation but what is Carnal. He saith the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> conceiv|ed Christ by the smell of a Rose, and that she was the sister of <HI>Moses,</HI> confounding her with <HI>Miriam,</HI> though there were so many hundred Years between. He belieth the Holy Ghost in affirming, that he in|spired <HI>Mahomet</HI> to write his <HI>Alcoran.</HI> He belieth the Scriptures, in saying they are corrupted by <HI>Christians;</HI> and that they Worship many Gods, and give God a Companion, by affirming the Divi|nity of Christ Jesus. He belieth the <HI>Iews,</HI> in say|ing they make <HI>Eleazer</HI> a God. He belieth the Pa|triarchs, in saying that <HI>Noah, Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> believed his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> tho' they lived so many thousand Years before he or his <HI>Alcoran</HI> had a be|ing. He belies the Apostles, in making them his Scholars, tho' they lived near 600 Years before he saw the Light. By all which it appears, that the Compiler of this <HI>Alcoran,</HI> was not the God of Truth but the Father of Lies. Especially if we consider the ridiculous stories found therein. He tells us,

That he once divided the Noon, one half whereof fell into his Lap, the other half on the Ground, which he after joined again together; and, per|haps, in memory of this lying Miracle the <HI>Turks</HI> use yet the Half Moon for their Arms, and on their Churches and Steeples. He tells of a great Army of Men and Angels raised by <HI>Solomon,</HI> which being much disturbed in their March by an Army of Flies, <HI>Solnmon</HI> reb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ked and routed them.

To conclude, in the Paradise which he pro|mises his Followers, he allows Appartments there|in to several Beasts, such as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Ram; <HI>Mo|ses</HI>'s Heifer&punc; <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Ant; the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI>'s Parrot; <HI>Esdras</HI> his Ass; <HI>Ionas</HI> his Whale; the 7 Sleepers Dog; and <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Camel.

The King deceasing and leaving Male Issu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> behind him, the Eldest ascends the Throne, while his Brothers are kept in the <HI>Haram</HI> or Castle, and their Eyes put out, and if the King have the least jealously, they are instantly put to death, yea the Children of the Kings Brothers and Sisters like|wise; Formerly they were not so rigorous, but only mov'd a red hot Iron to and fro before their Eyes; But <HI>Sha Sefi</HI> perceiving that the poor unhappy Princes had some sight left, ordered their Eyes to be digged out of their Heads; <HI>Sha Sefi</HI>'s cruelty spared not his Eldest Son <HI>Sha Abhas</HI> the Heir of his Throne, ordering one of the Eunuchs to move an Iron before his Eyes, no man knowing a reason; but the Eunuch compassionating the young Prince, moved an Iron yet not red hot before his Eyes, and teaching him to counterfeit blindness preserv'd his sight till his Father lay upon his Death-bed, when being very Penitent for having put out the Eyes of his Eldest Son to whom the Crown did of right belong, the Eunuch seeing the King so sadly afflict|ed, and ready to give up the Ghost, assured him that he would restore the Prince to his sight, and brought him with perfect Eyes to his Bed-side, the sight of whom prolonged the Kings life till next

day, and gave him time to command all the Gaan|dees of the Court to obey <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> his Eldest Son, as his lawful Successor.</P>
<P>There are several of these blind Princes at <HI>Ispa|han,</HI> and I knew one particularly, saith my Author, a person of excellent natural parts; As blind as he is, he is a great lover of Curiosities, and has built him a House at <HI>Ispahan</HI> worth seeing. He is over|joyed when he meets with any Rarities out of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> feeling them in his hands, and causing his Eunuchs to tell him the meaning of every thing: He is a great admirer of Clock-work and Watches, and to know what a Clock it is, has little points set up in the Dial-plate, and a half hand which points to the hour; with certain Figures which he makes of soft Wax, and sets in order upon a Ta|ble, he will cast up an Account exactly. Several other good quilities are eminent in him, and it is a miserable spectacle that a Man should be redu|ced to that deplorable condition only because he is of the Blood-Royal of <HI>Persia,</HI> This State is distin|guished like most of those in <HI>Europe</HI> into three bo|dies, First that of the Sword, which answers to the Nobility, and consists of the Kings houshold, the <HI>Kans</HI> or Governors, and all the Souldiery. The second that of the Gown, comprehending all those that belong to the Law and Courts of Justice. The third is composed of Merchants, Handicrafts men, and Labourers.</P>
<P>Among other cunning Contrivances of <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> to know the true state of his Affairs without trust|ing too much to his Ministers, he oft went disgui|sed into the City like an ordinary man under pre|tence of buying and selling, to discover whether false Weights and Measures were used; so going one Evening, in the habit of a Countrey-man, to a Ba|kers to buy a Man of Bread, and thence to a Cooks to buy a Man of Roast-meat, (a Man is six pound sixteen ounces to the pound) having bought his
<PB N="143" REF="75">
bargains he return'd to the Court, where causing them to be weighed exactly, he found the Bread to want 57 Drams, and the Meat 43. Upon which he fell into a rage against the Officers and the Go|vernor of the City (whose Belly he had caused to have been ript up but for the intercession of his Lords) reproaching them for their negligence of the publick good, and of the injustice of false Weights, how sadly the cheat fell upon poor Men, who having great Families, and thinking to give them 800 Drams of Bread, by that fraud deprived them of 143, then turning to the Lords, he de|manded what Justice ought to be done to those people; none daring to open their Mouths while he was in that passion; he commanded a great O|ven to be made in the Market-place; and a Spit big and long enough to roast a Man, and the Oven to be heated all Night, and a Fire to be kindled near the Oven. Next Morning the King caused the Cook and Baker to be apprehended, and led quite though the City, with two Men going before proclaiming to the people; <Q>We are going to put the Baker into a red hot Oven in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> to be baked alive for selling bread by false Weights; and the Cook is to be roasted alive for having sold Meat by false Weights.</Q>Thus these two Men ser|ved for an Example not only to <HI>Ispahan</HI> but to all the Kingdom, every one dreading the severe Ju|stice of <HI>Sha Abbas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sha Abbas</HI> his successor acted almost such another piece of severity, for having made one <HI>Iafer Kan,</HI> a great Lord, who kept a magnificent Train, Go|vernouor of <HI>Asterabat;</HI> At first he was very mild, but at last began to exact such sums from the peo|ple, that his violences reached the Kings Ear; who being one day drinking with his Lords, and seeing the Master of his Musick in the Room, who was a merry Droll, and had always some pleasant news to tell the King, he was pleased to ask him what the
<PB N="144" REF="76">
people said of <HI>Iafer-Kan,</HI> adding that he had made him Governour of divers Provinces, and had ne|ver heard any complaint of him, but now he was accused of Tyranizing over the people. The Mu|sick Master being a meer Flatterer, and knowing that <HI>Iafer-Kan</HI> was extreamly beloved of the King, confidently averd'd, that the Governor was falsly accused, and that he had always known him apter to give than receive. There was present an <HI>Agis</HI> lately returned from a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca;</HI> him the King also asked what was his opinion of <HI>Ia|fer-Kan</HI> and his Government, being a person long acquainted with him; The <HI>Agis</HI> thinking to please the King, returned the same answer. The King who was well informed of the <HI>Kans</HI> behaviour, turning to the Lords present, <Q>What think you, said he, of these two Flatterers, that absolutely know the contrary to what they speak.</Q>And commanded two of the Musick Masters Teeth to be pluckt out and driven into the head of the <HI>Agis,</HI> which had like to have cost him his life, being a very old Man; As for <HI>Iafer-Kan</HI> he was disgraced for a time, but his excellent Accomplishments soon restored him again to favour.</P>
<P>Murther is severely punished, nor will Money save the Criminal; The Murtherer is carried be|fore the Magistrate; he delivers him to the Parents or Kindred of the person slain, who carry him to Execution, and without compassion torture him to death. The Governor of <HI>Shiras</HI> had a Favou|rite, who falling in love with a young <HI>Persian</HI> Gentleman endeavoured to abuse his Body; One day meeting upon the Road, and lying under the same Tent, the Favourite about Mid-night came to his Bed-side, and after many sollicitations would have forced him; But being violently resisted, for madness to find himself disappointed, and liable to be discovered, he stab'd the young Gentleman to the heart, and fled to the Mountains. The Mur|ther

being divulged, the Mother, Widdow, and Sister of the young Man repaired to the Governor for Justice, who willing to save his Favourite, of|fered them Money, which they with scorn refusing, and threatning to complain to the King; he was constrained to pursue hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Favourite; at length he took and sent him to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> saying, he would not judge of the Affair, but refer it to the King.

Immediately he was carried to execution, where the Widdow first stab'd him to the heart with a Dagger, then the Mother took he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> turn, and after that the Sister, and then holding a Cup to receive his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ood, drank every one a Cup full to quench the thirst of their Revenge.</P>
<P>Extraordinary care is taken for securing the High-ways, and Guards set at convenient distances; As the Caravan was one day setting out from <HI>Tau|ris</HI> to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> a poor Fellow took an occasion to rob a Cloak-bag, and fled cross the Fields not knowing the way, the Merchant missing his Goods complain'd to the Governor, who sent order to the Guards to search strictly for him. The Thief be|ing constrained to forsake his Cloak-bag, and cross the Fields for Water, was seized and carried to the Governor, and soon convicted, for Thieves find no mercy in <HI>Persia;</HI> Only they are variously put to death, being sometimes tyed to a Camels Tayl by the Feet, and their Bellies ript open. Sometimes buried alive all but their Heads, and starved to death, in which torment they will oft desire Pas|sengers to cut off their Heads, though it be a kind|ness forbidden by the Law.

<P>THis Fort is on the Coast of <HI>Coromandell</HI> where the Honourable <HI>East-India</HI> Company have a Factory. On <HI>November</HI> 3. 1684. About 9 at night there happened a violent Storm in this Place, which continued till 2 next morning. It untiled all the Houses in the Town, with such a ratling noise, as if some thousands of Granadoes had been thrown on them, and lay'd all their Gardens (of which they have many pleasant ones) as level as the Smoothest Bowling Green. Trees of an ancient and prodigious Growth, some perhaps as ancient as <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood, were violently torn up by the Roots, and their Aged Trunks riven in peices, the noise of the crashing and fall of their Boughs and Branches seeming almost to equal that of a Tempest. But what was most surprizing was, that a strong Iron Bar which belonged to a Window, was with the extream force of the Wind, snapped into 3 peices. Had this Hurricane continued two or 3 hours longer, it would certainly have level'd both the Fort and Town; tho' strongly built, and well fortified.

<HEAD>The History of <HI>Savagi</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Rebel.</HEAD>
<P>THe Plundeiing of <HI>Surat</HI> by the famous Rebel <HI>Savagi,</HI> and other his Actions deserve here to be inserted. This <HI>Raja,</HI> or Lord <HI>Savagi</HI> was Born at <HI>Bashaim,</HI> the Son of a <HI>Captain</HI> of the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> and being of a turbulent Spirit, rebelled in his Fathers lite time; and putting him|self in the head of several Banditti, and other de|bauched young men, he retired into the mountains of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> and defended himself against all those that came to attack him. The King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> thinking that his Father kept Intelligence with him, caused him to be seized and imprisoned where he dyed. <HI>Savagi</HI> was hereat so incensed against the King that he breathed nothing but revenge. And in a short time plundered <HI>Visiapour</HI> his principal City, and with the booty he took there, made himself so powerful, as to be able to seize several Towns, as <HI>Rajapour, Sasigar, Crapaten, Daboul,</HI> and to form a little State thereabout. The King dying about that time, and the Queens endeavours to re|duce him being unsuccessful, she accepted the Peace he proposed to her, That he should enjoy the Territories which he had subdued, and be tributa|ry to the Young King, and pay him half his Re|venue.</P>
<P>However <HI>Savagi</HI> could not rest, but being a stout man, vigilant, bold, and undertaking in the highest degree, he resolved to seize upon <HI>Cha-best|kan</HI> Governour of <HI>Decan,</HI> and Uncle to the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> with all his Treasures even in the midst of his Armys, in the Town of <HI>Aurenge Abad.</HI> And had effected his design if he had not been discove|red
<PB N="151" REF="79">
too soon. For one night being accompanied with a crew of resolute Fellows he got into the very Apartment of <HI>Cha-hest kan;</HI> where the Go|vernours Son, forward in his Fathers defence was killed, and he himself grieivously wounded; <HI>Sava|gi</HI> in the mean time getting away without damage. Yet this disappointment did not daunt him in the least, insomuch that he undertook another bold and dangerous enterprize in the Year 1664. which succeded better. He drew about 3000 chosen men out of his Army, with whom he took the Feild without noise; spreading a Report by the way, that it was a Nobleman going to Court.</P>
<P>When he was neer <HI>Surat</HI> that Famous and Rich Port of the <HI>Indies,</HI> instead of Marching farther&punc; as he made the Grand Provost of that Countrey whom he met, believe, he fell into that Town, cutting off the Arms and Legs of the Inhabitants to make them discover their Treasures, searching, digging, and loading away, or burning what he could not carry away with him. He continued plundring 40 days; So that none but the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> saved themselves, because they were in a good posture of defence; especially the <HI>English,</HI> who having time to send for assistance from some of their Ships which lay near the Town, behaved themselves gal|lantly and saved besides their own, several other Houses near them.</P>
<P>A certain Jew of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who had brought Rubies of a great value, to sell them to the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> was thrice brought upon his knees, and had the knife held up to cut his Throat, yet still persisted in his denial that he had any, and so sa|ed his Life and Jewels.</P>
<P>At that time the K. of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> had sent an Am|bassador to the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> with several Presents, and among others, Twelve curious Horses, and a little Mule, the Skin of which was speckled like that of a Tyger; So finely, so variously, and so
<PB N="152" REF="80">
orderly streaked that no Silkin Stuff of <HI>India</HI> was more beautiful. There were also 2 Elephants Teeth, so prodigiously large that a very strong man could scarce lift one of them from the ground. Lastly, the Horn of an Oxe full of Civet, half a foot broad on the top. They were no sooner arri|ved at <HI>Surat,</HI> but <HI>Savagi</HI> came and ransackt and burnt the Town, and there House among the rest, So that they could save nothing but their Letters. He emptied the Oxes horn, and carried away the Horses and the Elephants Teeth. <HI>He</HI> durst not at|tack the Castle; but Marcht off without oppositi|on, loaden with Gold, Silver, Jewels, Silk Stuffs, fine Linnen and other Rich Merchandize, to the Value of Three hundred thousand pound <HI>English</HI> money.</P>
<P>The Great <HI>Mogol</HI> sent an Army under <HI>Iesseingue</HI> to besiege the principal Fortress of <HI>Savagi,</HI> who be|ing expert in matters of treaty, he so ordered the business, that <HI>Savagi</HI> surrendred before it came to extremity; and afterward joined with the <HI>Mogol</HI> against <HI>Visapour;</HI> The <HI>Mogol</HI> declaring him a <HI>Raja,</HI> taking him under his protection, and making his Son a considerable Commander. Some time after the <HI>Mogol</HI> intending War against <HI>Persia,</HI> writ such obliging Letters to <HI>Savagi,</HI> extolling his Genero|sity, Ability and Conduct, that he at length resol|ved, upon the Faith of <HI>Iesseingue</HI> to come to the <HI>Mogol</HI> at <HI>Dehli.</HI> A Kinswoman to the <HI>Mogol</HI> being then at Court, having a great influence upon him, perswaded him to secure <HI>Savagi,</HI> who had murde|red her Son, wounded her husband, and destroyed <HI>Surat.</HI> So that one evening <HI>Savagi</HI> saw his Pavil|lions beset with 3 or 4 Begments of Souldiers. But he made shift to get away in the night; the eldest Son of <HI>Iesseingue</HI> was suspected to have furthered his escape; but many say'd, that it was by the con|sent of the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> since he could no longer retain him at Court, because of the great spleen of
<PB N="153" REF="80">
the Women against him, for having dipt his hands in the Blood of their kinsmen. After this <HI>Savagi</HI> seized on many strong Holds, mostly seated upon steep mountains, the <HI>Mogol</HI> not being able to reduce him, and he often ravages the Countrey from <HI>Goa</HI> to the very Gates of <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>He has likewise Ships at Sea, and in the Year 1683 Fifteen hundred of his men in 3 Ships and four Grabbs, attackt an <HI>English East-India</HI> Ship Capt. <HI>Iohn Hide</HI> Commander, but were bravely repulsed with a great slaughter, though those brave <HI>Englishmen</HI> had not the happiness long to enjoy the honour of that Noble Action, their Ship being un|fortunately cast&punc; away coming into the Channell, and all the Men but Two, lost. <HI>Savagi</HI> now Acts as King, and secures himself in the mountains where the <HI>Mogol</HI> is not able to attack him.</P>

After this, <HI>India</HI> was invaded by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great; He vanquishing first <HI>Clophae</HI> Queen of <HI>Magaza,</HI> and then King <HI>Porus,</HI> both whom he took Prisoners; But restoring them again their Liberty and Kingdom returned back to <HI>Baby|lon,</HI> where he dyed of poyson. After this they lived in peace under several Kings. In 1587. their Countrey being discovered by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and
<PB N="157" REF="82">
after by the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> they have had much Traffick with them.</P>
<P>This vast Empire comprehends the greatest part of the Continent of <HI>Asia,</HI> wherein are contained 37 Kingdoms. As for Remains of Antiquity, there are few or none, the <HI>Mogols</HI> having ruined all the Ancient Buildings, which according to the Ancients were 30 large Citys, and 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">00 Walled Towns and Castles, so strong as to be thought impregnable; which may not be improbable, if <HI>Noah</HI> first planted there, after his descent from Mount <HI>Ararat,</HI> not far distant from hence. Since such mighty Ar|mys were raised in those Countreys not many Years after, and the Land so well Built and planted; so that when <HI>Alexander</HI> had overthrown King <HI>Porus</HI> near the River <HI>Hydaspis,</HI> he say'd, He found greater Citys and more sumptuous Buildings in <HI>India</HI> then in all the World besides. Some of the Citys that end in Pore, as <HI>Meliapore, Visiapore,</HI> and others, seem to retain the Memory of K. <HI>Porus,</HI> as others in <HI>Scander,</HI> the Name of <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P>The Dominions of the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> are larger then the <HI>Persians,</HI> and equal to the Grand Seigniors. His strength lyes in the Number of his Subjects, the Vastnes of his wealth, and the extent of his Empire; his Revenue exceeding the <HI>Persian</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> both put together. But the K. of <HI>Persia</HI> exceeds him in Horse, Arms, and warlike People. His Revenue is reckoned to be about Seaven Milli|ons and an half, <HI>English</HI> money. The Throne alone wherein he gives Audience, is valued at near Four Millions, being almost covered with Jewels, Pearls, and all kind of precious stones of a vast Value. The present <HI>Mogol</HI> derives his Original from <HI>Tamberlan</HI> the <HI>Scythian,</HI> who overcame all <HI>Asia,</HI> and took <HI>Ba|jazet</HI> the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperor Prisoner, putting him into an Iron Cage, against the Bars of which he beat out his brains. When <HI>Tamberlain</HI> had taken him Prisoner, he was brought before him, who fix|ing

his Eyes upon him fell a laughing, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">jazet</HI> be|ing highly offended feircely say'd to him, Laugh not at my Fortune Sir, but know it is God that disposes of Kingdoms and Empires, and the same may happen to you to morrow that has befaln me to day. To which <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">amerlain</HI> replyed, I know this as well as you, nor do I laugh at your misfortunes but am thinking that certainly these Kingdoms and Empires are very contemptible things in the eyes of God, since he gives them to such inconside|rable Persons as we are, you a deformed one eyed man, and I pitiful lame Creature.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is the General Heir to all those to whom he gives Pensions; and his will is a Law in the decision of his subjects affairs, and therefore they carry the Names of their Imployments, and not of the Lands which they enjoy. Now because of this Barbarous tho' Ancient Custom, in the late <HI>Mogols</HI> Reign one of the Ancient Governours being very Rich, and finding himself near Death, think|ing upon this unreasonable Law, which oft renders the Wife of a Nobleman and her Children poor and miserable in an Instant; He secretly distributed all his great Estate to indigent Gentlemen, and poor Widdows; filling his Trunks, with Old Iron, old Shoes, Rags and bones, Locking and Sealing them close, saying, they were Goods belonging to the <HI>Mogol;</HI> before whom they were brought after his death, and opened in his presence before his Lords that all saw this fine stuff; which so discomposed the <HI>Mogol,</HI> that he rose and went away in a great fury. He is able to bring 100000 Horse into the Field, but the Foot are inconsiderable. <HI>Chah, Iehan</HI> the Father of the present Emperor left behind him about 500000 Livers, besides the Rich Throne aforementioned. The present Emperor or <HI>Mogol</HI> is called <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> having usurpt the kingdom from his Father upon this occasion. This great King having reigned 40 Years with much clemency
<PB N="159" REF="83">
and Justice; in his declining Age fancied a Young Lady of extraordinary beauty not above 13 Years Old. And because the strength of nature would not permit him to satisfy his Passion, he took cer|tain Provocatives, which were so hot that he fell into a distemper which had almost killed him. This obliged him to shut himself up in a strong Fortress, together with his Women, for 2 or 3 Months; During this time he seldom appeared to his People, and then at a great distance, which made them be|lieve he was dead. He had 4 Sons and 2 Daugh|ters, whom he loved all alike, making his Sons Governours or Vice Roys of four of the principal Provinces in his Kingdom. During this false re|port of his Death, <HI>Dara</HI> his eldest Son continued with him; But soon after they raised Armys, and fought against one another; And after many Bat|tels and much Bloodshed <HI>Aurengzeb</HI> the Third Son having destroyed his Three Brethren, mounted the Throne, keeping his Father Prisoner. Some time after, he sent to his Father for some of his Jewels, that he might appear before his People with the same magnificence his Predecessors had done. <HI>Chah-Iehan</HI> taking his request for an Affront, fell into such a rage that he continued mad for some days, and had like to have died upon it; he cal|led several times for a Mortar and Pestle, to beat all his Jewels to Powder rather than his Son should have them, but <HI>Begum Saheb</HI> his Eldest Daughter throwing her self at his feet, by virtue of that Cri|minal power she had over him as being both his Daughter and his Wife, kept him from it, more out of design to preserve the Jewels for her self than her Brother, to whom she was a Mortal Enemy; For this reason when <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> ascended the Throne he had only one Jewel on his Bonnet, and as a Penance, for so many Crimes he would not eat wheaten Bread, Flesh nor Fish, but fed upon Bar|ley Bread, Herbs and Sweat Meats; But <HI>Chajehan</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="84">
his Father dying in 1666. finding himself rid of an object that reproached his Tyranny, he began to enjoy himself with more delight, receiving his Sister <HI>Begum</HI> into favour, and calling her <HI>Cha Be|gum</HI> or <HI>Princess Queen;</HI> a Woman of excellent ac|complishments, and able to govern an Empire; and had her Father and Brothers taken her Counsel <HI>Auren-zeb</HI> had never been King; He had another Sister called <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">uchenara Begum,</HI> who always took his part and sent him all the Gold and Silver she could procure when she heard he had taken Arms; in recompence whereof he promised when he came to be King to give her the Title of <HI>Cha Begum,</HI> and that she should fit upon a Throne; all which he performed; and they lived lovingly together. This Princess having secretly conveyed a handsom young man into her Apartment could not let him out so privately, after she had quite tired him, but the King had notice thereof; The Princess to prevent the shame ran to the King, and in a pretended fright told him, there was a man got into the Ha|ram even to her very Chamber who designed either to have kill or Rob her; That such an accident was never before known, and that it concerned the safety of his Royal Person, and he would do well to punish the Eunuchs who kept the Guard that night. The King ran instantly with a great num|ber of Eunuchs, so that the poor Young Man had no way to escape but by leaping out at a Window into the River that runs by the Pallace Walls; a multitude of people ran out to seize him, the King commanding they should do him no harm, but carry him to the Officer of Justice; yet he hap|pily escaped and has not been since heard of.</P>
<P>It is an Ancient custom among the Heathen <HI>In|dians</HI> that the Husband happening to dye the Wife can never marry again; so when he is dead, she retires to bewail him, shaves her hair, and lays aside all her ornaments, taking off her Arms and
<PB N="161" REF="84">
Legs, the Braccelets her Husband put on when he espoused her, in token of her submission, and being chained to him; and all her life after she lives des|pised, yea worse than a Slave in the House where she was formerly Mistress. This causes them ra|ther to dye with their Husbands than live in such Contempt, the <HI>Bramins</HI> or Priests perswading them, that after Death they shall meet him again in the other World with greater advantage; Yet can no Woman burn her self without leave from the Gover|nour of the Place, who being a <HI>Mehometan,</HI> and ab|horring this execrable custom of self Murther does often deny it. Some women, are so offended thereat that they spend the rest of their lives, in works of Charity. Some sit on the Road Boyling Pulse in Water and giving the Liquor to Travel|lers to drink; others hold Fire ready in their hands to light their Tobacco; others make vows to eat nothing but the undigested grains which they find in Cow-dung. But when the Governor finds no perswasions will alter the Womans resolution, and perceives by a sign from his Secretary that she has given him Money to that purpose, he in a surly man|ner bids the Devil take her, and all her kindred; Immediately the Musick strikes up, and away they go to the House of the deceased, with Drums beat|ing and Flutes playing, in which manner they ac|company the Person to the place appointed; All her kindred and Friends come and congratulate her for the happiness she is to enjoy in the other World, and the honour their Family receives by this her generous resolution. She then dresses her self as if going to be Married and is conducted in Triumph to the place of Execution, with a loud noise of Musical Instruments and Womens voices, singing Songs in honour of the miserable creature that is going to dye. The <HI>Bramins,</HI> exhort her to courage and constancy, and many <HI>European</HI> Specta|tors think that these Preists give her some stupify|ing
<PB N="162" REF="85">
Liquor to take away the fear of Death; for it is their interest that these miserable Wretches should destroy themselves: Their Bracelets about their Legs and Arms, Pendants, Rings, and Jewels all belonging to them, who rake them from among the ashes when she is burnt; sometimes a little Hut of Reeds is erected on the bank of a River, bes|meared with Oyl and other Drugs. The Woman is placed in the middle in a leaning posture with her head on a kind of Wooden Bolster, and rest|sting her back against a Pillar, to which the <HI>Bramin</HI> tyes her about the middle, lest she should run away upon feeling the Fire. In this posture she holds the Body of her deceased Husband upon her knees, chewing Betele about half an hour. The Woman bids them fire the Hut, which is quickly done, her kindred and Friends throwing Pots of Oyl into it, to dispatch her. In some places they only build a Pile of Wood upon which the Woman is placed as on a Bed, with her Husbands Body layed cross her, then some bring her a Letter, others peices of Cali|coe, Silver or Copper, desiring her to deliver them to their Mother, Brother, Kinsman, or Friend in the other World; when she has received all, she puts them between her Husbands Body and her own, tyed up in a peice of Taffety, and then calls to kindle the Pile, wherewith she is soon stifled; but there being scarcity of Wood in <HI>Bengale,</HI> the bodies of these poor Wretches arem any times only grilliaded and then cast into the River <HI>Ganges</HI> to be devoured by Crocodiles.</P>
<P>The magnanimity of many of these Women is admirable; The <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Velou</HI> having lost his City and life in a Battle against the King of <HI>Visiapours</HI> General, he was extreamly lamented, and eleven of his Wives resolved to be burnt at his Funeral. The General endeavoured to divert them by kind usage, but finding perswasions in vain he or|dered them to be shut up in a Room; the Women
<PB N="163" REF="85">
in a rage told him, <Q>That 'twas to no purpose to keep them Prisoners, for if they might not have leave to do what they had resolved, in three hours there would not one of them be alive. </Q>He laughed at this Menace, but the Keeper of those Women opening the Doors 3 hours after, found them all stretched out dead upon the place, without the lest Mark of any outward violence offered to them.</P>
<P>Two of the greatest Lords of <HI>India</HI> came in 1642. to do Homage to <HI>Cha-jehan;</HI> they having offended the Grand Master of the Household, he told one of them one day in the Kings presence,<Q> that they had not behaved themselves as became them toward so great a Monarch. </Q>The <HI>Raja,</HI> or Lord looking on himself as a great Prince, he and his Brother having brought with them a Train of sixteen thousand Horse, being netled at this bold reproof of the Grand Master, drew out his dag|ger and slew him on the place before the King; The Grand Master falling at the feet of his own Brother who stood just by him, he was going to revenge his Death, but was prevented by the <HI>Ra|ja's</HI> Brother who stab'd him likewise, and lay'd him athwart his Brothers Body; The King seeing these 2 Murthers retired into his Apartment for fear; but the Nobles and people presently fell upon the <HI>Raja's</HI> and cut them to peices; The King incen|sed at such an attempt committed in his House and presence, commanded the bodies of the <HI>Raja's</HI> to be thrown into the River, which their Troops that they had left about <HI>Agra</HI> understanding threat|ned to enter the City and Pillage it; so the King was advised to deliver them the Bodies of their Princes. When they were to be burned, thirteen Women belonging to the two <HI>Raja's</HI> came dancing and got upon the Funeral Pile, holding one another by the hands, and being stifled by the Smoak, fell all together into the Fire; presently the <HI>Bramins</HI>

<PB N="165" REF="86">
threw in great heaps of Wood, Pots of Oil, and other combustible matter to dispatch them. When I was at <HI>Patna,</HI> saith my Author, a handsom young Woman of about two and twenty, came to desire leave of the Governour to be burnt with the Body of her dead Husband; The Governour compassio|nating her Youth and Beauty, strove to disswade her, but finding her resolute, askt her, whether she understood what the Torment of Fire was, or had ever burnt her Fingers?<Q> No, no, answered she, I do not fear fire, and to let you know as much send for a lighted Torch hither. </Q>The Go|vernour abominating her answer, in passion bid her go to the Devil. Some young Lords present desi|red the Governour to call for a Torch and try her; the Woman ran to meet it, and held her hand in the Flame without altering her countenance, fea|ring her Arm up to the very Elbow, that her Flesh looked as if broil d, whereupon the Governour commanded her out of his sight.</P>
<P>The Government of the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> is (as we have say'd) arbitrary and Tyranical, measuring his power by his Sword and Lance, and making his will his Law, there being no Laws to regulate Governours in the administration of Justice but what are written in the Breasts of the King and his Substitutes; and so they often take the Liberty to punish the offender rather than the offence; mens persons more than their Crimes; though they still pretend to proceed by proofs and not pre|sumptions. In matters of consequence the <HI>Mogol</HI> himself will sit as Judge, and no Malefactors lye above one night in Prison, and many times not at all, for if the Offender be apprehended early in the morning, he is instantly brought before the Judge, by whom he is either acquitted or condemned; if it be Whipping, that is executed usually with much severity in the place of Justice; If condem|ned to dye he is presently carried from Sentence
<PB N="166" REF="87">
to Execution, commonly in the Market-place; which quick Judgment keeps the People in such awe, that there are not many Executions. Murder and Theft they punish with death of what kind the Judge please to impose, some Malefactors being hang'd, others beheaded, some imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">led upon sharp Stakes a death of extream cruelty and torture; some are torn to pieces by wild Beasts, some killed by Elephants, and others Stung to death by Ser|pents. Those that suffer by Elephants, who are trained up for Executions, are thus dealt withal; If the Beast be commanded by his Rider to dispatch the poor trembling Offender presently, who lies prostrate before him, he with his broad round Foot at one stamp kills him, but if he be condemned so to die as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> himself dye, the Elephant will break his Bones by degrees with his hard trunk, as first his Legs, then his Thighs, after that the Bones in both his Arms, this done his wretched Spirit is left to breath its last out of the midst of those bro|ken Bones.

<P>When I was in <HI>India,</HI> saith my Author. One was sentenced by the <HI>Mogol</HI> for killing his own Father to dye thus; a small Iron Chain was fastned to his Heel, and tyed to the hind Leg of a great Elephant, who drag'd him one whole remove of that King being about ten Miles, so that all his Flesh was torn off his Bones when we met him, and appea|red rather a Skeleton than a Body. Another ha|ving killed his Mother, the Emperour was at a stand to think of a punishment adequate to so hor|rible a crime, but after a little pause, he adjudged him to be stung to Death by Serpents; so one of those Mountebanks who keep them to shew tricks to the People, brought two Serpents to do Execu|tion upon this wretched man; whom he found na|ked (only a little covering before) and trembling. Then having angred these venemous Creatures, he put one to his Thigh, which presently twined it self about that part till it came near his Groin, and there bit him till Blood followed; The other was fastned to the outside of the other Thigh twisting it round, and there bit him likewise; the Wretch kept upon his Feet a quarter of an hour, before which the Serpents were taken from him, but com|plained extreamly of a Fire that tormented all his Limbs, and his whole Body began to swell exceed|ingly, like <HI>Nafidius</HI> bit by a <HI>Libyan</HI> Serpent called a <HI>Prester;</HI> and about half an hour after, the Soul of that unnatural Monster left his groaning Carcase.</P>
<P>It happened a few years before Sir <HI>Thomas Row</HI> was Ambassador in this Court in 1618. that a Jugler of <HI>Bengal,</HI> a place famous for Witches, brought an Ape before the <HI>Mogol,</HI> who loved No|velties, that did many strange feats; the King to try his sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l pluckt a Ring off his Finger, and gave
<PB N="168" REF="88">
it one of his Boys to hide, whom the Ape presently discovered; several other tryals he made, wherein the Ape did his part to admiration; At length this strange and unexpected fancy came into the Kings Head; <Q>There are many disputes, <HI>said he,</HI> about that true Prophet which should come into the World, we are for <HI>Mahomet;</HI> The <HI>Persians</HI> mag|nifie <HI>Mortis Ally,</HI> the <HI>Hindoos</HI> or Heathens extol <HI>Bramon, Ram.</HI> and others, the <HI>Iews</HI> are for <HI>Mo|ses.</HI> and the Christians for Christ,</Q> adding several others to the number of twelve, who have all their several Followers in that part of the World; He then caused them twelve names to be written on twelve several Scrolls, and put together to try if the Ape could draw out the name of the true Pro|phet; this done the Ape put his paw amongst them and pull'd out the name of Christ; The <HI>Mogol</HI> a second time caused these twelve names to be writ again in twelve other Scrolls and Characters, and put together, when the Ape again pluckt forth the name of Christ as before; <HI>Mahomet Chan</HI> a great Favourite present, said it was an Imposture of the Christians, though none were then there; and desired to make a third trial, which granted, he put but eleven of those names together, reserving the name of Christ in his hand; the Ape searching as before, pluckt forth his empty paw, and so twice or thrice together the King demanding the reason, was answered, that happily the thing he looked for was not there; the Ape was bid search for it, who putting out those eleven names one after the other in a seeming indignation rent them, then running to <HI>Mahomet Chan</HI> caught him by the hand where the name of Christ was concealed, which he opened, and held up to the King, but did not tear it as the former. Upon which the <HI>Mogol</HI> took the Ape, and gave his Keeper a good Pension to keep him near about him, calling him <HI>the Divining Ape.</HI> And this was all which followed
<PB N="169" REF="88">
upon this admrable event, except the great won|der and amazement of the people, the truth where|of saith my Author, was confirmed to me by seve|ral Persons of different Religions, who all agreed in the story and the several circumstances thereof.</P>
<P>I cannot but relate a remarkable example of a gross Flatterer, but a great Favourite of this King, noted to be a great neglecter of God, believing it Religion enough to please the <HI>Mogol</HI> his Master, though a Souldier of approved valour. This man on a time sitting in dalliance with one of his Wo|men, she pluckt an hair from his breast about his Nipple in wantonness, without designing any hurt. This little inconsiderable wound by an unparallel'd fare became the occasion of his death, beginning presently to fester, and in a short time turned to an incurable Canker; When he found he must needs dye, he spake these notable words worthy to be recorded. <Q>Who would not have thought but that I who have been so long a Souldier should have died in the face of an Enemy, either by a Sword, Lance, Arrow, Bullet, or some such Instrument of death? But now, though too late, I am forced to confess that there is a great God above, whose Majesty I have ever despised, who needs no big|ger Lance than an hair to kill an Atheist or a des|piser of his Divinity; </Q>and so desiring these his last words might be told the King his Master, he died.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> is a Prince of much Wealth and Power having multitudes of Souldiers in con|stant pay, and in his ordinary removes which are not usually above ten mile at once, hath such an infinite number of men and other Creatures atten|ding him whose drink is water, that in a little time, as it was said of the mighty Host of <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> they are able to drink up Rivers.</P>
