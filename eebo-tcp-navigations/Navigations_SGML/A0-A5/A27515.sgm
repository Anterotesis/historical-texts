<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF The Late Revolution OF THE DOMINIONS OF THE <HI>GREAT MOGOL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ire of &s;eeing the World having made me Travel into <HI>Pale&s;tina</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> would not let me &s;top there; it put me upon a re&s;olution to &s;ee the <HI>Red Sea</HI> from one end to the
<PB N="2" REF="10">
other. I went from <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> after I had &s;taid there above a year; and in two and thirty hours, going the <HI>Cara|van</HI> pace, I arrived at <HI>Suez,</HI> where I embarked in a Galley, which in &s;eventeen days carry'd me, always in &s;ight of land, to the Port of <HI>Gidda,</HI> which is half a days journey from <HI>Mecca.</HI> There I was con&s;trained (con|trary to my hopes, and the promi&s;e which the <HI>Beig</HI> of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> had made me) to go a &s;hore on that pre|tended Holy Land of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> where a Chri&s;tian, that is not a Slave, dares not &s;et his foot. I &s;taid there four and thirty days; and then I embarked in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, which in fifteen days carried me along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia the Happy</HI> to <HI>Moka,</HI> near the Streight of <HI>Babel-mandel.</HI> I re&s;olved to pa&s;s thence to the I&s;le of <HI>Ma&s;owa</HI> and <HI>Arkiko,</HI> to get as far as <HI>Gouder,</HI> the Capital Town of the Country of <HI>Alebech,</HI> or the Kingdom of <HI>Aethiopia;</HI> but I received certain information, that, &s;ince the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> had been killed there by the intrigue of the Queen Mother, or ex|pelled,
<PB N="3" REF="10">
together with the Je&s;uit Pa|triarch, whom they had brought thi|ther from <HI>Goa,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks were not &s;afe there; a poor Capuchin having lo&s;t his head at <HI>Suaken,</HI> for having attempted to enter into that Kingdom: That indeed, by going under the name of a <HI>Greek</HI> or an <HI>Ar|menian</HI> I did not run &s;o great hazard, and that even the King him&s;elf, when he &s;hould know, that I could do him &s;ervice, would give me Land to Till by Slaves, which I might buy if I had money; but that undoubtedly they would forthwith oblige me to Marry, as they had lately done a certain Frier, who had pa&s;&s;ed there under the name of a <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;itian; and that they would never &s;uffer me to come away again.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, among others, induced me to change my re&s;olution. I went aboard of an <HI>Indian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Streights, and in two and twenty days I arrived at <HI>Surratte</HI> in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> the Empire of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> in the Year 1655. There I found,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
that he who then Reigned there, was call'd <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, King of the World; who, according to the Hi&s;tory of that Countrey, was Son of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> which &s;ignifieth Conque|rour of the World, Grandchild of <HI>Ekbar,</HI> which is Great, and that thus a&s;cending by <HI>Hohmayons,</HI> or the Fortunate, Father of <HI>Ekbar,</HI> and his other Predece&s;&s;ors, he was the <HI>Tenth</HI> of tho&s;e that were de|&s;cended from that <HI>Timur-Lengue,</HI> which &s;ignifieth the <HI>Lame Prince,</HI> commonly and corruptly call'd <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> &s;o renow|ned for his Conque&s;ts; who Married his near Kin&s;woman, the only Daugh|ter of the Prince of the Nations of <HI>Great Tartary,</HI> call'd <HI>Mogols,</HI> who have left and communicated their Name to the &s;trangers, that now Govern <HI>In|do&s;tan,</HI> the Countrey of the <HI>Indians;</HI> though tho&s;e that are employ'd in publick Charges and Offices, and even tho&s;e that are li&s;ted in the <HI>Militia,</HI> be not all of the Race of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> but &s;trangers, and Nations gather'd out of all Countries, mo&s;t of them <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Arabians,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Turks.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11" MS="y">
For, to be e&s;teem'd a <HI>Mogol,</HI> 'tis enough to be a &s;tranger white of Face, and a <HI>Mahumetan;</HI> in di&s;tinction as well to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are brown, and <HI>Pagans,</HI> as to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> who are call'd <HI>Franguis.</HI></P>
<P>I found al&s;o at my arrival, <HI>that</HI> this King of the World, <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> of above &s;eventy years of Age, had four Sons and two Daughters; <HI>that,</HI> &s;ome years &s;ince, he had made the&s;e four Sons Vice-Kings or Governours of four of his mo&s;t con&s;iderable Provinces or Kingdoms; <HI>that</HI> it was almo&s;t a year that he was fallen into a great &s;ick|ne&s;s, whence it was believed he would never recover: Which had occa&s;ioned a great divi&s;ion among the&s;e four Bro|thers (all laying claim to the Empire) and had kindled among them a War which la&s;ted about five years, and which I de&s;ign here to de&s;cribe, ha|ving been pre&s;ent at &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Actions, and entertained for the &s;pace of eight years at that Court, where Fortune and the &s;mall &s;tock of Money (left me after divers

encounters with Robbers, and the expences of a Voyage of &s;ix and forty days from <HI>Suratte</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> the Capital Towns of that Empire) obliged me to take a Salary from the <HI>Grand Mogol</HI> in the quality of a Phy&s;i|tian, and a little while after from <HI>Danech-mend-Kan,</HI> the mo&s;t knowing Man of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who had been <HI>Bakchis</HI> or Great Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and was one of the mo&s;t powerful and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords of that Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elde&s;t</HI> of the&s;e four Sons of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was call'd <HI>Dara,</HI> that is <HI>Darius.</HI> The <HI>Second</HI> was call'd <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> that is the Valiant Prince. The Name of the <HI>Third</HI> was <HI>Aurenge-Zebe,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Ornament of the Throne. That of the <HI>Fourth</HI> was <HI>Mo|rad-Bakche,</HI> as if you &s;hould &s;ay, De|&s;ire accompli&s;hed. Of the two Daugh|ters, the elde&s;t was call'd <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> that is the Mi&s;tre&s;s Prince&s;s; and the younge&s;t <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> which is as much as Bright Prince&s;s, or the Splendour of Prince&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">
'Tis the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey, to give &s;uch Names to their Princes and Prince&s;&s;es. Thus the Wife of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;o renown'd for her Beau|ty, and for having a Tomb, which much more de&s;erved to be reckon'd among the Wonders of the World, than tho&s;e un&s;hapen Ma&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e heaps of &s;tones in <HI>Egypt,</HI> was called <HI>Tage-Mehalle,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Crown of the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and the Wife of <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> who hath &s;o long Govern'd the State, whil&s;t her Hu&s;|band minded nothing but Drinking and Diverti&s;ements, was fir&s;t called <HI>Nour-Mehalle,</HI> and afterwards, <HI>Nour-Jehan-Begum,</HI> the Light of the <HI>Sera|glio,</HI> the Light of the <HI>World.</HI> The rea&s;on, why they give &s;uch kind of Names to the Great Ones, and not Names from their Land or Dominion (as is u&s;ual in <HI>Europe)</HI> is, becau&s;e all the Land being the Kings, there are no Marqui&s;ates, Earldoms and Dut|chies, of which the Grandees might bear their Names; all con&s;i&s;ts in Pen|&s;ions either of Land or ready Money,

Though he was a Mahumetan, and publickly expre&s;&s;ed in the ordinary Exerci&s;es of Religion to be &s;o, yet, in private, he was Heathen with the Heathen, and Chri|&s;tian with the Chri&s;tians.

He was re&s;erved, crafty, and exceedingly ver&s;ed in di&s;&s;embling, in&s;omuch that for a long while he made profe&s;&s;ion to be <HI>Fakire,</HI> that is, Poor, <HI>Dervich,</HI> or Devout, renoun|cing the World, and faining not to pretend at all to the Crown, but to de&s;ire to pa&s;s his Life in Prayer and other Devotions. In the mean time he failed not to make a party at Court, e&s;pecially when he was made Vice-King of <HI>Decan;</HI> but he did it with &s;o much dexterity, art, and &s;ecrecy, that it could hardly be perceived. He al&s;o had the skill to maintain him&s;elf in the Affection of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Father, who although he much loved <HI>Dara,</HI> could yet not forbear to &s;hew that he e&s;teemed <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and judged him capable to Reign; which cau&s;ed jea|lou&s;ie enough in <HI>Dara,</HI> who began to find it, in&s;omuch that he could not

<P><HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> the Younge&s;t of all, was the lea&s;t dextrous, and the lea&s;t judicious. He cared for nothing but mirth and pa&s;time, to drink, hunt, and &s;hoot.

<P>Concerning the two Daughters, the Elde&s;t, <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> was very Beautiful, and a great Wit, pa&s;&s;io|nately beloved of her Father. It was even rumoured, that he loved her to that degree as is hardly to be imagined, and that he alledged for his excu&s;e,

She was exceedingly enriched by great pen&s;ions, and by co&s;tly pre&s;ents, which &s;he received from all parts, for &s;uch Negotiations as &s;he employed her &s;elf in about her Father: And &s;he made al&s;o great expences, being of a very liberal and generous di&s;po&s;ition.

<P>Now 'tis reported, that this Prince&s;s found means to let a young Gallant enter the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> who was of no great Quality, but proper, and of a good Meen.

her, under the pretence of giving her a Vi&s;it, as he u&s;ed to do. The Prince&s;s &s;eeing him come unexpected, had no more time than to hide this unfortunate Lover in one of the great Chaudrons made to Bath in; which yet could not be &s;o done, but that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> &s;u&s;pected it. Mean time he quarrelled not with his Daughter, but entertained her a pretty while, as he was wont to do; and at length told her, that he found her in a care|le&s;s and le&s;s neat po&s;ture; that it was convenient &s;he &s;hould wa&s;h her &s;elf, and bath oftner; commanding pre|&s;ently, with &s;omewhat a &s;tern coun|tenance, that forthwith a Fire &s;hould be made under that Chaudron, and he would not part thence, before the Eunuchs had brought him word, that that unhappy Man was di&s;patched.

Man of Courage and Ambition, the Darling of all, in&s;omuch that <HI>Chah-He&s;tkan,</HI> Uncle of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> pro|po&s;ed to Marry him to the Prince&s;s: But <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> received that propo|&s;ition very ill, and be&s;ides, when he was informed of &s;ome of the &s;ecret Intrigues that had been formed, he re&s;olved quickly to rid him&s;elf of <HI>Na|zerkan.</HI> He therefore pre&s;ented to him, as 'twere to do him honour, a <HI>Betele,</HI> which he could not refu&s;e to chew pre&s;ently, after the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey. <HI>Betele</HI> is a little knot made up of very delicate leaves, and &s;ome other things, with a little Chalk of Sea-Cockles; which maketh the Mouth and Lips of a Vermilion co|lour, and the Breath &s;weet and plea|&s;ing.

<P><HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;ome years before the Troubles, finding him&s;elf charged with the&s;e four Princes, all come to Age, all Married, all pretending to the Crown, Enemies to one another, and each of them making &s;ecretly a Party, was perplexed enough, as to what was fitte&s;t for him to do, fearing dan|ger to his own Per&s;on, and fore&s;eeing what afterwards befell him: For, to &s;hut them up in <HI>Goualeor,</HI> which is a Fortre&s;s where the Princes are ordi|narily

They were too potent already, each of them having a Princely Train. And again, he could not hand&s;omely remove them far off, without giving them &s;ome Government fit for their Birth; wherein he apprehended they would Cantonize them&s;elves, and become little independent Kings; as actually they afterwards did. Neverthele&s;s, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould cut one ano|thers Throat before his Eyes, if he kept them &s;till at Court, he at la&s;t con|cluded to &s;end them away.

<P>Upon this Enterview, and confir|mation of Friend&s;hip, both Armies Marched together, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> con|tinuing always, during the March, in the prote&s;tations of Friend&s;hip, and in his Court&s;hip to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> treating him never otherwi&s;e, whether in publick or private, but with the Title of <HI>Hazaret,</HI> that is, King and Ma|je&s;ty: So that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was fully per&s;waded, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> meant &s;incerely, from an exce&s;s of affection towards him; whence he even wil|lingly, and without ceremony, &s;uf|fer'd the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and re&s;pects he &s;hew'd him; in&s;tead of remembring what had lately pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> and of con&s;idering, that he, who had thus hazarded him&s;elf with &s;o much boldne&s;s to u&s;urp a Kingdon, was

not of a temper to live and dye a <HI>Fakire</HI>-</P>
<P>The&s;e two Armies thus joyned made a Body con&s;iderable enough; which begot a great noi&s;e at Court, and gave cau&s;e of thoughtfulne&s;s, not only to <HI>Dara,</HI> but to <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> him&s;elf, who knew the great parts and &s;ubtle Con|duct of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and the Courage of <HI>Morad-Bakche;</HI> and who fore&s;aw very well, that a Fire was a kindling, which would be very hard to quench. It was to no purpo&s;e to write Letters upon Letters, &s;ignifying that he was well, and giving Order that they &s;hould turn back to their re&s;pective Governments, and expre&s;&s;ing al&s;o, that he would forget all that had pa&s;&s;ed hitherto. All his <HI>Letters</HI> were not able to hinder their advance; and as the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> did &s;till pa&s;s for mortal, there being no per|&s;ons wanting to bring and &s;pread &s;uch News, they &s;till continued to di&s;&s;em|ble, giving out, that they were <HI>Let|ters</HI> counterfeited by <HI>Dara;</HI> that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was dead indeed; but that, in
<PB N="50" REF="37">
ca&s;e he were alive, they would go to ki&s;s his Feet, and deliver him from the hands of <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>What then &s;hould <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> this unfortunate King, do, who &s;eeth, that his Sons have no regard to his Orders; who is informed at all hours, that they march apace towards <HI>Agra</HI> in the head of their Armies, and who in this conjuncture finds him&s;elf &s;ick to boot in the hands of <HI>Dara,</HI> that is, of a man who breatheth nothing but War; who prepareth for it with all imaginable earne&s;tne&s;s, and with all the marks of an enraged re&s;entment again&s;t his Brothers? But what could he do in this extremity? He is con|&s;trained to abandon to them his Trea|&s;ures, and to leave them to their di&s;po|&s;al. He is forced to &s;end for his old and mo&s;t tru&s;ty Captains, whom he knows for the mo&s;t part to be not very affectionate to <HI>Dara;</HI> he mu&s;t command them to fight for <HI>Dara,</HI> a|gain&s;t his own Blood, his own Chil|dren, and tho&s;e, for whom he hath more e&s;teem than for <HI>Dara;</HI> he is ob|liged

<P><HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Dara,</HI> a young Prince of about Five and twenty years of Age, very proper of Body, and of good Parts and Con|duct, generous, liberal, and univer|&s;ally beloved, e&s;pecially of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who had already enriched him, and who con&s;idered <HI>him</HI> rather for his Suc|ce&s;&s;our than <HI>Dara,</HI> was he, that was made General of this Army again&s;t <HI>Sujah.</HI> Neverthele&s;s <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who wi&s;hed much rather, that <HI>Sujah</HI> were return'd to <HI>Bengale,</HI> than that the mat|ter &s;hould be tryed by a bloody Com|bat, which could not be but very Tragical, and wherein he run the hazard of lo&s;ing one or other of his Sons, gave him for Companion an Ancient <HI>Raja,</HI> called <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> who is at pre&s;ent one of the powerfulle&s;t and riche&s;t <HI>Rajas</HI> of all <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and one

the able&s;t in the whole Kingdom, with a &s;ecret Order not to fight, ex|cept it were altogether unavoidable; as al&s;o to endeavour by all means to induce <HI>Sujah</HI> to retire, and to re&s;erve his Forces for a better occa&s;ion; that is to &s;ay, after they &s;hould have &s;een the event of the &s;ickne&s;s of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> and the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and of <HI>Morad-Bache.</HI> But this young Prince, <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> full of heat and cou|rage, breathing after nothing but to &s;ignalize him&s;elf by &s;ome great action, and <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> fearing le&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> gaining a Battel &s;hould fir&s;t make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Capital Towns of the Empire, <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehly;</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> to keep them from a Combat. The two Armies are no &s;ooner in &s;ight of one another, but they prepare to fall on, and they were not long from giving &s;ome Vollies of Cannon. I &s;hall not relate the particulars of this Fight, for, be&s;ides that the narration of it would be too long and tedious, in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory we &s;hall be ob|liged
<PB N="53" REF="38">
to de&s;cribe more con&s;iderable ones, by which the Reader will be able to judge of this. 'Tis &s;ufficient to know in general, that the fir&s;t on|&s;et was very &s;harp and ob&s;tinate on both &s;ides, but that at length <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> did urge <HI>Sujah</HI> with that force and vigour, that he di&s;order'd him, and made him fly: So that if <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> and the <HI>Patan Delil-kan,</HI> who was one of the fir&s;t Captains and a valiant Man, but an intimate Friend of the <HI>Raja,</HI> and did not act but being moved by him, had &s;econded him in good ear|ne&s;t, 'tis thought that the whole Army of <HI>Sujah</HI> would have been de|feated, and him&s;elf in danger of being taken: But that was not the De&s;ign of the <HI>Raja</HI> to de&s;troy him, no more than it was that of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who had given him order to the contrary. Thus then had <HI>Sujah</HI> time to retreat, and that without lo&s;ing any con&s;ide|rable number of his Men; yet becau&s;e <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> kept the field, and brought away &s;ome pieces of Artil|lery, it was pre&s;ently bruited at Court,
<PB N="54" REF="39">
<HI>Sujah</HI> had been totally over|thrown. This Defeat purcha&s;ed great reputation to <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> le&s;&s;en'd much the e&s;teem of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and cooled exceedingly all the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> that had an inclination for him.</P>
<P>After that &s;ome days were &s;pent in the pur&s;uit of <HI>Sujah,</HI> the Prince <HI>Soli|man Chekouh,</HI> who every day received News from the Court, and who lear|ned, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> did approach with great re&s;o|lution, well knowing, that his Fa|ther <HI>Dara</HI> had no great &s;tock of pru|dence, but good &s;tore of &s;ecret Ene|mies, re&s;olved to quit the pur&s;uit of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and with all &s;peed to return to <HI>Agra,</HI> where in all appearance <HI>Dara</HI> was to give Battel again&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI> This was the be&s;t coun&s;el he could take, for no man doubts, that if he could have been there in good time, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would not have had the advantage; and 'tis even believed, he would never have hazarded the Combat, the party being too unequal; but the bad fortune of <HI>Dara</HI> did not permit it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="39">
Whil&s;t all that was thus tran&s;acted toward <HI>Elabas,</HI> which is the place where the <HI>Gemna</HI> is joyned to <HI>Ganges;</HI> the Scene was very different on the &s;ide of <HI>Agra.</HI> At the Court they were much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed the River of <HI>Brampour,</HI> and all the other pa&s;&s;ages that were mo&s;t difficult between the Mountains; &s;o that with all ha&s;te they &s;ent away &s;ome Troops to di&s;pute with him the pa&s;&s;age of the River <HI>Eugenes,</HI> whil&s;t the whole Army was making ready. For which purpo&s;e, there were cho&s;en two of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and the mo&s;t powerful of the Kingdom to command it; the one was <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan,</HI> a renowned Captain and very affectionate to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> but one that had no great in|clination to <HI>Dara,</HI> and who went not but to oblige <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> whom he &s;aw in the hands of <HI>Dara:</HI> The other was <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> a potent <HI>Raja,</HI> not inferiour to <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> and Son-in-law to that <HI>Raja Rana,</HI> who was at the time of <HI>Ekbar</HI> &s;o pui&s;&s;ant, as if he had been the Emperour of the <HI>Raja's. Dara</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="40">
at their farewel expre&s;&s;ed to them great kindne&s;s, and pre&s;ented them nobly; but <HI>Chah Jehan</HI> took his time, before their departure, to charge them in &s;ecret, as he had done the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> when he went away in the Expedition again&s;t <HI>Sultan Suiah</HI> with <HI>Soliman Chekouh.</HI> Neither were they wanting, in their March, to &s;end &s;everal times to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Mo|rad-Bakche,</HI> to per&s;wade them to turn back: But this was in vain; their Envoys came not again, and the Ar|my advanced with that diligence, that they &s;aw it much &s;ooner than they thought upon a ri&s;ing ground, not far remote from the River.</P>
<P>It being then Summer, and the &s;ea&s;on of the greate&s;t heats, the River was fordable; which was the cau&s;e, that at the &s;ame time <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan</HI> and the <HI>Raja</HI> prepared them&s;elves to give Battel; be&s;ides that, they &s;oon knew the re&s;olution of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that he would force them, &s;ince that, al|though his Army was not all come up, he gave them &s;ome Vollies of Can|non;
<PB N="57" REF="40">
his de&s;ign being to amu&s;e them, fearing le&s;t they them&s;elves &s;hould pa&s;s the River, not only to prevent his pa&s;&s;age, but al&s;o to hinder his Army from repo&s;ing, and from taking an advantageous po&s;t; which was indeed in great di&s;order, and &s;o tired by their March, and &s;o faint by the heat, that if at the very fir&s;t it had been a&s;&s;aulted, and kept from pa&s;&s;ing the Water, it would doubtle&s;s have been routed without much re&s;i&s;tance. [I was not by in this fir&s;t Encounter, but thus it was generally di&s;cour&s;ed of, and it agreeth with the after-relation of many of our <HI>French-men,</HI> who &s;erved <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the Artillery.] But they were content to &s;tay at the River-&s;ide, to keep <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> from pa&s;&s;ing it, according to the Order they had re|ceived.</P>
<P>After that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had let his Army re&s;t two or three days, and by amu&s;ing the Enemy, had fitted it to pa&s;s the River, he made his whole Artillery play, which was very well placed; and he commanded, that under
<PB N="58" REF="41">
the favour of the Cannon they &s;hould pa&s;s the River. <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan</HI> and the <HI>Raja,</HI> on their part, di&s;charged theirs al&s;o, and did what they could to re|pul&s;e the Enemy, and to keep him from pa&s;&s;ing. The Combat was &s;harp enough at fir&s;t, and very ob&s;tinately maintained by the extraordinary Va|lour of <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne.</HI> For as to <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan,</HI> although a great Captain, and a &s;tout Man, he gave no great proof of his Valour in this occa&s;ion; yea, &s;ome accu&s;e him of Treachery, char|ging him that he had in the night cau&s;ed the Bullets and Powder to be hid under the Sand, there being no more of them to be found after two or three di&s;charges. However it be, the Combat for all that was, as I &s;aid, very re&s;olutely carried on, and the pa&s;&s;age long di&s;puted. There were Rocks in the Bed of the River, which did much embara&s;s, and the Banks in many places were very high and diffi|cult to climb up. But at la&s;t, <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf into the water with &s;o much re&s;olution and force, and
<PB N="59" REF="41">
&s;hew'd &s;o much valour and boldne&s;s, that there was no re&s;i&s;ting of him. He pa&s;&s;ed over, and with him a good part of the Army, which made <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan</HI> to give back, and ca&s;t <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> into great danger of his per&s;on. For by and by he found the whole Body of the Enemy upon him, and without the extraordinary re&s;olution of his <HI>Ra|gipous,</HI> who almo&s;t all were killed about him, he had been a dead man. One may judge of the great danger he was in upon this occa&s;ion, by this, that after he had di&s;engaged him&s;elf as well as he could, and was come back to his own, not daring to return to <HI>Agra,</HI> becau&s;e of the great lo&s;s he had &s;uffered, of &s;even or eight thou&s;and <HI>Ragipous</HI> he had but five or &s;ix hundred of them re|maining.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Ragipous,</HI> who take their name from the <HI>Rajas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Children of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> are from Father to Son &s;uch Men as make the Sword their Profe&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Rajas,</HI> who&s;e Subjects they are, do a&s;&s;ign them Lands for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, on condition to
<PB N="60" REF="42">
be always ready to go to War when &s;ummoned. So that one might &s;ay, that they were a &s;ort of Pagan Nobles, if the <HI>Rajas</HI> gave them their Lands in pro|priety for them and their Children. They are great takers of <HI>Opium;</HI> and I have &s;ometimes wondred at the quantity I have &s;een them take: They accu&s;tom them&s;elves to it from their youth. On the day of Battel they double the Do&s;e, this Drug animating, or rather inebriating them, and ma|king them in&s;en&s;ible of danger; in&s;o|much that they ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Combat like &s;o many furious Bea&s;ts, not knowing what it is to run away, but dying at the feet of their <HI>Raja,</HI> when he &s;tands to it. They want nothing but Order, Re&s;olution they have enough. 'Tis a plea&s;ure thus to &s;ee them, with the fume of <HI>Opium</HI> in their head, to embrace one another, when the Battel is to begin, and to give their mutual Farewels, as Men re&s;olved to dye. And that they do for this rea&s;on; that the <HI>Great Mo|gol,</HI> though a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and by con|&s;equence
<PB N="61" REF="42">
an Enemy of the Heathen, yet for all that entertains always a good number of <HI>Rajas</HI> in his &s;ervice, whom he con&s;iders as his other <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and imploys in his Armies as if they were <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot forbear to relate here the fierce reception, which the Daughter of the <HI>Rana</HI> gave to her Husband <HI>Je&s;|&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> after his defeat and flight. When &s;he heard that he was nigh, and had under&s;tood what had pa&s;&s;ed in the Battel; that he had fought with all po&s;&s;ible courage, that he had but four or five hundred Men left; and that at la&s;t, not being able to re&s;i&s;t any longer the Enemy, he had been obliged to retreat: She, in &s;tead of &s;ending one to receive him, and to con&s;ole him in his misfortunes, com|manded in a dry mood to &s;hut the Gates of the Ca&s;tle, and not to let this infamous Man enter; that he was not her Husband; that &s;he would never &s;ee him; that the Son-in-law of the Great <HI>Rana,</HI> could not have &s;o low a Soul; that he was to remember,
<PB N="62" REF="43">
that being grafted into &s;o Illu&s;trious an Hou&s;e, he was to imitate the Vir|tue of it; and, in a word, that he was either to vanqui&s;h or to dye. A moment after &s;he was of another humour; &s;he commands a Pile of Wood to be laid, that &s;he might burn her &s;elf, that they abus'd her; that her Husband mu&s;t needs be dead; that it could not be otherwi&s;e. And a little while after this, &s;he was &s;een to change her countenance, to fall into pa&s;&s;ion, and to break out into a thou|&s;and reproaches again&s;t him. In &s;hort, &s;he remained thus tran&s;ported eight or nine days, without being able to re&s;olve to &s;ee her Husband, 'till at la&s;t her Mo|ther coming in, brought her in &s;ome degree to her &s;elf, and comforted her, a&s;&s;uring her, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Raja</HI> had but a little refre&s;h'd him&s;elf, he would rai&s;e another Army, to fight <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and repair his Honour at any rate.</P>
<P>By which &s;tory one may &s;ee a pat|tern of the Courage of the Women in that Countrey: To which I could
<PB N="63" REF="43">
add &s;omething I have &s;een &s;ome of them do, who burned them&s;elves a|live after the death of their Husbands; but we mu&s;t re&s;erve this Di&s;cour&s;e for another place, where I &s;hall al&s;o &s;hew, that there is nothing which opinion, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, cu&s;tom, hope, and the point of honour, &amp;c. may not make Men do or &s;uffer.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> having under&s;tood what had pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Eugenes,</HI> fell into that choler again&s;t <HI>Ka&s;em-Kan,</HI> that it was thought he would have cut off his Head, if he had been upon the place. He was al&s;o tran&s;ported again&s;t <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> as the Per&s;on that was the fir&s;t and principal Cau&s;e of the Misfortune, and who had furni&s;h'd <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> with Men, Money, and Cannon. He is ready to kill his Son <HI>Mahmet Emir-Kan,</HI> and will &s;end his Wife and Daughter to <HI>Ba&s;ar,</HI> or the Market|place of pro&s;tituted Women; and 'tis pa&s;t doubt, that he would have done &s;ome &s;uch thing, if <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> with much art and prudence, had not mo|derated the exce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion, in
<PB N="64" REF="44">
remon&s;trating to him, that <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> had not &s;o little conduct, nor &s;o great a Friend&s;hip for <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as to hazard, and in a manner to &s;a|crifice his Family, for the advancing of his Intere&s;t; that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> mu&s;t needs have gulled and en&s;nared him, by his u&s;ual artifice and cunning.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bak|che,</HI> the happy &s;ucce&s;s of this fir&s;t En|counter did &s;o &s;well their hearts, and gave &s;uch Courage to their whole Army, that henceforth they believed them&s;elves invincible, and capable to compa&s;s any thing. Be&s;ides, <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the more to animate his Soul|diers, bragged openly, that he had Thirty thou&s;and <HI>Mogols</HI> at his devotion in the Army of <HI>Dara;</HI> and there was &s;omething in it, as appeared by the &s;equel. <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was for nothing but fighting, and would march with all diligence. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> repre|&s;ented to him, that it was nece&s;&s;ary the Army &s;hould refre&s;h them&s;elves for &s;ome time upon the Banks of this &s;weet River; that in the mean time
<PB N="65" REF="44">
he would write to all his Friends, and get a full and certain information of the &s;tate of the Court, and of the condition of all Affairs. So that he marched not towards <HI>Agra,</HI> 'till he had re&s;ted &s;ome days, and after that he marched but &s;lowly, to inform him&s;elf of all, and to take his time and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> when he plainly &s;aw the re&s;olution of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> and that there was no hope left to make them turn back, he was in &s;uch a perplexity, that he knew not what to re&s;olve, and fore&s;eeing &s;ome great calamity, he would fain have hindred the la&s;t deci&s;ive Battel, for which he &s;aw <HI>Dara</HI> preparing him&s;elf with great eagerne&s;s. But what could he do to oppo&s;e it? He was yet too weak of his &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;aw him&s;elf &s;till in the hands of <HI>Dara,</HI> whom, as I have &s;aid, he tru&s;ted not much: So that he found him&s;elf obliged to acquie&s;ce in his Will, and to commit to him all the Forces of the Empire, and to
<PB N="66" REF="45">
command all Captains to obey him. Immediately all was in Arms: I know not, whether there was ever a more gallant Army &s;een in <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, that there were little le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and twenty thou&s;and Foot, with four thou&s;and peeces of Cannon, without reckoning the incredible number of Servants, Followers, Victuallers, whom Hi&s;tori|ans me thinks do often put into the number of the Combatants, when they &s;peak of tho&s;e formidable Armies of three or four hundred thou&s;and Men, of which their Books are full. Though this Army was very brave, and &s;trong enough to cut in pieces two or three of &s;uch as <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had, in which there were no more than thirty five or forty thou&s;and Men in all, and the&s;e tired and hara&s;&s;ed by a very long and irk&s;om March, during the height of the Heats; and but a &s;mall number of Cannon, in re&s;pect of that of <HI>Dara.</HI> Mean time (which &s;eems hard to be|lieve) there was &s;carce any Body that pre&s;aged well for <HI>Dara,</HI> all knowing,

I &s;ay, the Captains them&s;elves of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> bore great affection and re&s;pect to this Prince, who&s;e Creatures they mo&s;t were; and the whole Army, in a manner, was his.

<P>Then they advi&s;ed <HI>Dara,</HI> that if he would not hearken to this Expe|dient, he &s;hould at lea&s;t not precipi|tate the bu&s;ine&s;s, but delay, 'till <HI>Soli|man Chekouh,</HI> who made all ha&s;te to joyn, were come in.

<P>He looked upon him&s;elf as Ma&s;ter of the Per&s;on of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> that he could di&s;po&s;e of him as he plea&s;ed; that he was al&s;o Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all the Trea&s;ures and Forces of the Empire; that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was half ruined; that his two other Brothers, with a weak and tired Army, were come to ca&s;t them&s;elves into his hands; that, if he gained the Battel, they could not e&s;cape him; that he &s;hould all at once be ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, and at the end of all his troubles, and at the height of his wi&s;hes, &s;o as no body could con|tradict him in any thing, or di&s;pute the Crown with him. Whereas if <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> &s;hould take the Field, all Affairs would be accommodated, his Brothers would return to their Go|vernments, <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who began to recover his health, would re&s;ume

the Government as before, and all things would return into their fir&s;t channel: That, if he &s;hould &s;tay for <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> his Son, <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> might take &s;ome De&s;ign to his di&s;ad|vantage, or contrive &s;omething with <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> that whatever he could do for gaining the Victory, the Repu|tation, which <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> had pur|cha&s;ed, would &s;till give him all the honour of it. And after that, what would not he be capable to undertake, &s;welled with &s;o much glory and &s;uc|ce&s;s, and e&s;pecially being &s;upported, as he was, by the favour and affection of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and of the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Omrahs?</HI> What did he know, whether he would keep any mode&s;ty, or any re&s;pect for him, and whether his Ambition might not carry him?</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations made <HI>Dara</HI> re&s;olve to &s;tand out again&s;t the coun&s;el of all, and to pur&s;ue his point. And for that purpo&s;e, he commanded im|mediately the whole Army to take the Field, and thereupon came to take

leave of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> who was in the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra.</HI> This good old Man was ready to melt in tears, when he embraced him; but withall failed not to repre&s;ent to him, with a very grave countenance: Well, <HI>Dara,</HI> &s;ince thou art re&s;olved to follow thine own will, go, God ble&s;s thee, but remember well the&s;e few words; <HI>If thou lo&s;e&s;t the Battel, take heed of ever coming into my Pre&s;ence.</HI> But this made no great im|pre&s;&s;ion upon him; he goeth forth briskly, taketh hor&s;e, and &s;eizeth on the Pa&s;&s;age of the River <HI>Tchembel,</HI> which is about Twenty Miles from <HI>Agra;</HI> where he fortified him&s;elf, ex|pecting his Enemy. But the &s;ubtile and crafty <HI>Fakire,</HI> who wanted no good Spies, and people that gave him in|telligence of all, and who knew that the Pa&s;&s;age was there very difficult, took good heed to attempt the forcing it.

where he encamped is but five leagues from <HI>Agra,</HI> it was formerly called <HI>Sa|monguer,</HI> and now <HI>Fateabad,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Place of Victory.</HI> A little while after, <HI>Dara</HI> al&s;o came to encamp there, nigh the Bank of the &s;ame River, between <HI>Agra</HI> and the Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI></P>
<P>The two Armies were there be|tween three and four days in &s;ight of one another, without fighting. Mean time <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> wrote &s;everal Letters to <HI>Dara,</HI> that <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> was not far off; that he &s;hould not precipitate; that he &s;hould come near <HI>Agra,</HI> and chu&s;e an advantageous place to fortifie him&s;elf 'till he came. But <HI>Dara</HI> an|&s;wer'd, that before three days were pa&s;&s;ed, he would bring to him <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> tyed hand and foot, to do with them what he &s;hould think fit. And without expecting any longer, he began at that very hour to put his Army in Battel array.</P>
<P>He placed in the Front all his Can|non, cau&s;ing them to be tyed the one to the other with Chains, to &s;hut
<PB N="74" REF="50">
the pa&s;&s;age to the Cavalry. Behind the&s;e Peeces of Cannon, he placed al&s;o front-wi&s;e a great number of light Ca|mels, on the forepart of the Bodies whereof they fa&s;ten a &s;mall Peece, of the bigne&s;s of a double Mu&s;quet; a Man &s;itting on the hind-part of the Camel, being able to charge and di&s;|charge without lighting. Behind the&s;e Camels &s;tood the greate&s;t part of the Mu&s;queteers. Of the re&s;t of the Army, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in Cavalry, furni&s;h'd with Bows and Arrows, (as ordinarily are the <HI>Mogols,</HI> that is, at pre&s;ent, white Men, Ma|humetans, &s;trangers, as <HI>Per&s;ians, Turks, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Usbecks;)</HI> or with a Sword, and a kind of Half-pike, as commonly are the <HI>Ragipous:</HI> Of all the&s;e, I &s;ay, there were made three different Bodies. The right Wing was committed to <HI>Calil-ullah-Kan,</HI> with Thirty Thou&s;and <HI>Mogols</HI> under his Command; for he was made Great <HI>Bakchis,</HI> that is, Great Ma&s;ter of the Cavalry, in the place of <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> that was afterwards my <HI>Agah,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="50">
who voluntarily re&s;igned this Office, &s;eeing that he was not well beloved of <HI>Dara,</HI> for having always highly maintained again&s;t him the Intere&s;t and Authority of <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> The left Wing was given to <HI>Ru&s;tam-Kan Dakny,</HI> a very renowned and very va|liant Captain, together with the <HI>Raja Chatre&s;ale,</HI> and the <HI>Raja Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> put al&s;o their Army almo&s;t into the &s;ame Order; except that in the mid&s;t of the Troops of &s;ome <HI>Omrahs,</HI> they had hid &s;ome &s;mall Field-Peeces, which was, as was &s;aid, after the way and Art of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> and with no ill effect.</P>
<P>They hardly made u&s;e of any more Art, than what hath been now re|lated; only they placed here and there &s;ome Men ca&s;ting <HI>Bannes,</HI> which is a kind of Granado fa&s;tened to a &s;tick, that may be ca&s;t very far through the Cavalry, and which extremely terrifieth Hor&s;es, and even hurts and kills &s;ometimes.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="51">
All this Cavalry turns about very ea&s;ily, and they draw their Arrows with marvellous &s;wiftne&s;s; one Man being able to draw &s;ix of them, before a Mu&s;queteer can twice di&s;charge his Mu&s;quet. The &s;ame Cavalry keeps al&s;o very clo&s;e in &s;everal Troops under their re&s;pective Officers, e&s;pecially when they are going to fight hand to hand. But after all, I &s;ee not, that this way of putting an Army in array, is any great matter, in compari&s;on of our Armies, when in good order.</P>
<P>All things being thus di&s;po&s;ed, the Artillery began to play on both &s;ides; for 'tis always the Cannon that makes the prelude among&s;t <HI>them;</HI> and the Arrows were now &s;een to fly through the Air, when unexpectedly there hap|pen'd to fall a Storm of Rain, &s;o vio|lent, that it interrupted the Combat. The Rain cea&s;ing, the Cannon began afre&s;h to roar; and then it was that <HI>Dara</HI> appeared, who being mounted upon a proud Elephant of <HI>Ceilau,</HI> com|manded that an On&s;et &s;hould be made on all &s;ides; and him&s;elf advanced
<PB N="77" REF="51">
into the mid&s;t of the Body of the Ca|valry, directly towards the Enemies Artillery, who received him warm|ly, kill'd &s;tore of Men about him, and put into di&s;order, not only the Main Body which he commanded, but al&s;o the other Bodies of the Ca|valry that followed him. Yet not|with&s;tanding, becau&s;e he was &s;een to keep firm upon his Elephant, with|out any appearance of giving back, and was ob&s;erved to look every where about him with an undaunted look, and to make &s;igns with his hands to advance and to follow him, this di&s;|order &s;oon cea&s;ed, every one re&s;uming his Rank, and advancing in the &s;ame pace with <HI>Dara.</HI> But he could not reach the Enemy, without receiving another Volley of Cannon-&s;hot, which cau&s;ed a &s;econd and great di&s;order in his Men, and made a good part of them recoyl; yet he, without any change in his countenance, &s;tood to it, encouraging his Troops, and gave &s;till &s;igns, that they &s;hould follow him, and advance with &s;peed without any

lo&s;s of time. Thus pre&s;&s;ing vigorou&s;ly forward, he forced the Enemies Ar|tillery, broke the Chains, entred in|to their Camp, and made a Rout in their Camels and Infantry, and in every thing he met with on that &s;ide; open|ing al&s;o a good pa&s;&s;age to the Ca|valry that followed him. Then it was, that the Enemies Cavalry facing him, a &s;ore Combat began. A &s;howre of Arrows fill'd the Air from both &s;ides, <HI>Dara</HI> him&s;elf putting his hand to that work: But, to &s;ay truth, the&s;e Arrows do but little execution; more of them are lo&s;t in the Air, or broken on the ground, than hit. The fir&s;t Di&s;charges of Arrows being made, they fought hand to hand with their Sables, <HI>pe&s;le me&s;le,</HI> and the Combat was &s;toutly maintain'd on both &s;ides. <HI>Dara</HI> is &s;till &s;een to continue firm on his Elephant, encouraging, making a noi&s;e, and giving &s;igns on all &s;ides; and at la&s;t advancing with &s;o much re|&s;olution and force, again&s;t all that oppo&s;ed him in his March, that he overthrew the Cavalry, and made them to retire and run away.</P>

<HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who was not far from thence, and mounted al&s;o on an Elephant, &s;eeing this great di&s;order, was in great trouble, and laboured with all his might to remedy it; but to no purpo&s;e. He made the Main Body of his be&s;t Cavalry advance, to try whether he could make head again&s;t <HI>Dara;</HI> but it was not long be|fore this Body al&s;o was forced to give back, and to retreat in great di&s;order, whatever <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> could &s;ay or do to hinder it. Mean time let us take notice of his courage and re&s;olution: He &s;aw that almo&s;t the whole Body of his Army was di&s;ordered, and in a flying po&s;ture, in &s;o much that he had not a thou&s;and Men about him that kept their &s;tanding; (&s;ome told me, that there were &s;carce five hundred:) He &s;aw, that <HI>Dara,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the difficulty of the way, which was uneven, and full of holes in divers places, made as if he would ru&s;h in upon him: Yet, for all this, he lo&s;t no courage, and was &s;o far from being &s;truck with fear, or from retreating,
<PB N="80" REF="53">
that he &s;tood firmly to it, and called by name mo&s;t of his Captains that were about him, crying out to them, <HI>Delirane Kodah&eacute;,</HI> (the&s;e are his own words,) that is, <HI>Courage my old Friends, God is:</HI> What hope is there in flying? Know you not, where is our <HI>Decan? Kodah&eacute;, Kodah&eacute;, God is, God is.</HI> And that none might doubt of his being undaunted, and that he thought on nothing le&s;s than running away, he commanded before them all (oh &s;trange extremity!) that forthwith Chains &s;hould be fa&s;tened to the feet of his Elephant; and was going to fa&s;ten them in good earne&s;t, but that they all declared their courage and re&s;olu|tion, to live and dye with him.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> in the interim endeavoured to advance upon <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> though he was yet at a good di&s;tance from him, and though the difficulty of the way embara&s;&s;ed and retarded him much; he meeting al&s;o with &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, even from tho&s;e di&s;ordered Hor&s;e of the Enemy, that cover'd all high and low places where he was to March.

And this Encounter with <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was looked upon as <HI>the</HI> thing, that was to a&s;&s;ure <HI>Dara</HI> of the Victory, and to decide the Battel. And doubtle&s;s, he would have overcome all the&s;e dif|ficulties, and <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> with the &s;mall number left him, would not have been able to bid head to this victorious Army, if <HI>Dara</HI> had known how to profit of the pri&s;e he had in his hands. But here he failed; of which I &s;hall now &s;hew the occa&s;ion, and how thereby the Scale was turned to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Dara</HI> perceived that his left Wing was in great di&s;order, and he was in|formed, that <HI>Ru&s;tam-Kan</HI> and <HI>Chatre|&s;ale</HI> were killed; that <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;</HI> had too far advanced, that he had indeed forced the Enemy, and made way through the mid&s;t of them; but that now he was &s;urrounded every way, and in very great danger. This it was, which made <HI>Dara</HI> de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign of making directly towards <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that he might go to &s;uccour his left Wing. There at fir&s;t

the Battel was al&s;o very &s;harp, but <HI>Dara</HI> at la&s;t carried it, forcing and routing all, yet &s;o, as that there &s;till remained &s;omething that re&s;i&s;ted and &s;topped him. Mean time, <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;</HI> fought with &s;o much courage and vigour as was po&s;&s;ible. He woun|ded <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> and came &s;o near him, that he began to cut the Girdles of his Elephant, to make him fall down; but the valour and good for|tune of <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> gave not time enough for it. In &s;hort, never any Man fought and defended him&s;elf more bravely, than <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> did on this occa&s;ion: All wounded as he was, and pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Ragipous</HI> of <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;,</HI> who were round about him&punc; he was not daunted, nor gave way in the lea&s;t, but knew &s;o well to take his time, that, although he was, be|&s;ides defending him&s;elf, to cover with his Shield a Son of his, but of &s;even or eight years of Age, who was &s;it+ting on his &s;ide, he made an Arrow &s;hot &s;o luckily at <HI>Ram&s;eigne Routl&eacute;,</HI> that it made him fall dead to the ground.</P>

<HI>Dara</HI> &s;oon heard the &s;ad News of this Accident; but at the &s;ame time he under&s;tood al&s;o, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was in very great danger; the <HI>Ragi|pous</HI> fighting furiou&s;ly, and like Lions, to revenge the death of their Ma&s;ter. And though he &s;aw, on that &s;ide the way was very difficult, and that he &s;till found &s;ome &s;mall Body oppo&s;ing and retarding him; yet he was de|termined to ru&s;h through to <HI>Morad-Bakche:</HI> And doubtle&s;s this was the be&s;t he could do, and that, which was capable to repair the fault he had committed in not doing his bu&s;ine&s;s thoroughly with <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> But his bad fortune kept him from it, or rather, one of the blacke&s;t Treache|ries that ever was imagined, and the greate&s;t over&s;ight that was ever com|mitted, did cau&s;e the entire lo&s;s and ruin of <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Calil-ullah-Kan</HI> (he that commanded the Thirty Thou&s;and <HI>Mogols,</HI> which made the right Wing, and were alone able to defeat the whole Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe)</HI> did, whil&s;t <HI>Dara</HI> and

But after all, this Treachery would have done no great mi&s;chief, if this infa|mous Man had contented him&s;elf with this fir&s;t Effect of his Re&s;entment: Behold, how far he carried his rage, and revengefulne&s;s!

<P>Three or four days after the Battel of <HI>Samonguer,</HI> the Victorious <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> together with <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> came directly to the Gate of the Town into a Garden, which may be a little League di&s;tant from the Fortre&s;s, and &s;ent from thence an able Eunuch, and one of tho&s;e whom he mo&s;t confided in, to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> to &s;alute him with a thou&s;and fair prote&s;tations of his affection and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; that he was exceedingly &s;orry for what had pa&s;&s;ed, and for having been obliged, by rea|&s;on of the ambition and evil de&s;igns of <HI>Dara,</HI> to proceed to all tho&s;e extremi|ties; that, for the re&s;t, he rejoyced extremely to hear, that he began to

find him&s;elf better, and that he was come thither for no other end than to receive his Commands. <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was not wanting to expre&s;s to the Eunuch much &s;atisfaction, as to the procee|dings of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of this Son with all po&s;&s;ible appearances of joy; though he &s;aw very well, that matters had been carried too far, and &s;ufficiently knew the re&s;erved and crafty humour of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and his &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion for Reigning; and that therefore he was not much to be tru&s;ted, for all his fair words. And yet notwith&s;tanding he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be circumvented, and in &s;tead of playing the &s;ure&s;t Chart, <HI>by</HI> u&s;ing his utmo&s;t power, <HI>by</HI> &s;tirring, <HI>by</HI> appearing, <HI>by</HI> cau&s;ing him&s;elf to be carried through the Town, and <HI>by</HI> a&s;&s;embling all his <HI>Om|rahs,</HI> (for it was yet time to do all this) he goes about to out-wit <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> him that was his Crafts-Ma&s;ter, and attempts to draw him into a &s;nare, wherein he will be found taken him|&s;elf. He then &s;ends al&s;o an Eunuch

to this Son, to let him know, that he well under&s;tood the ill conduct, and even the incapacity of <HI>Dara;</HI> that he could not but call to mind the par|ticular inclination he always had and expre&s;&s;ed towards him, that he could not doubt of his affection; and la&s;tly, that he &s;hould come to &s;ee him, and to advi&s;e with him what was fit to be done in the&s;e di&s;orders; and that he pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;hed to embrace him.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> on his &s;ide, &s;aw al&s;o well enough, that he was not to tru&s;t too much to the words of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> knowing e&s;pecially, that <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> his Enemy as well as Si&s;ter, was night and day about him, and that 'twas very probable, he acted nothing but by her motion. And he apprehended, that if he &s;hould come into the For|tre&s;s, he might be &s;eized on, and ill treated; as it was &s;aid, that the re&s;o|lution was indeed taken to do &s;o, and &s;everal of tho&s;e lu&s;ty <HI>Tartarian</HI> Wo|men, which &s;erve in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> were armed to &s;et upon him as &s;oon as he &s;hould enter.

would never hazard him&s;elf, and yet &s;pread a rumour abroad, that the next day he would go to &s;ee his Father <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI> But when the day was come, he put it off 'till another, and &s;o he delayed it from day to day, with|out ever making the Vi&s;it. In the mean time he continued his &s;ecret Ne|gotiations and Cabals, and &s;ounded the mind of all the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;o far, that at la&s;t, after he had well and clo&s;ely laid his De&s;ign, and poli|tickly di&s;po&s;ed all things for the &s;ucce&s;s thereof, all were amazed to &s;ee, that one day, when he had &s;ent <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> his elde&s;t Son, to the For|tre&s;s, under a pretence of &s;eeing <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> in his name; this young Prince, bold and undertaking, falls pre&s;ently upon the Guards that were at the Gate, and vigorou&s;ly driveth all before him, whil&s;t a great number of Men appointed, who were there all ready, did enter with fury, and made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Walls.</P>
<P>If ever a Man was a&s;toni&s;h'd, <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was, &s;eeing that he was fallen

the &s;nare which he had prepared for others, that him&s;elf was impri|&s;on'd and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Fortre&s;s. 'Tis &s;aid, that he pre&s;ently &s;ent to &s;ound the mind of <HI>Sultan Mah|moud,</HI> promi&s;ing him upon his Crown and upon the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that if he would be faithful to him, and &s;erve him in this conjuncture, he would make him King; that he &s;hould come pre&s;ently to &s;ee him within, and not lo&s;e this occa&s;ion: Be&s;ides, that it would be an action that would accumulate on him the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, and an immortal Glory; in regard it would be &s;aid forever, that <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had deliver'd <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Grand|father out of Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>And certainly, if <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had been re&s;olute enough to give this &s;troke, and <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> could have come abroad to &s;hew him&s;elf to the Town, and to take the Field, no man doubts, but all his great <HI>Omrahs</HI> would have followed him; nor would <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf have had the boldne&s;s nor the &s;avagene&s;s to &s;ight again&s;t his

own Father in per&s;on, e&s;pecially &s;ince he mu&s;t have apprehended, that all the world would have abandon'd him, and po&s;&s;ibly <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> him&s;elf. And 'tis indeed the great fault which <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> is ob&s;erved to have com|mitted after the Battel, and the flight of <HI>Dara,</HI> not to have come out of the Fortre&s;s. But yet I have conver&s;ed with many, who maintained, that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> did prudently in it. For this hath been a que&s;tion much agi|tated among the Politicians, and there are no Rea&s;ons wanting to counte|nance the Sentiment of the latter &s;ort; who al&s;o add, that Men almo&s;t always judge of things by the Event; that often very fooli&s;h Enterpri&s;es have been ob&s;erved to &s;ucceed, and which therefore are approv'd by all; that if <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had pro&s;per'd in his De|&s;ign, he would have been e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t prudent and the mo&s;t able Man in the World; but now being taken, he was nothing but a good old Man, that &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be led by a Woman, his Daughter <HI>Begum,</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="64">
which was blinded by her pa&s;&s;ion, and had the vanity to believe, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would come to &s;ee her that the Bird of it &s;elf would fly into the Cage, or at lea&s;t, that he would never be &s;o bold as to attempt the &s;eizure of the Fortre&s;s, nor have the power to do &s;o. The&s;e &s;ame Rea&s;o|ners maintaining al&s;o ftifly, that the greate&s;t fault that <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly commit, was, that he knew not how to take the occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the Crown, by the rare&s;t and the mo&s;t generous Action that ever was, to put his Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do him&s;elf Right and Ju&s;tice, as the Soveraign Umpire of Affairs; whereas, as things now &s;tand, he mu&s;t one day go and dye in <HI>Goualeor.</HI> But <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> (whe|ther it was that he fear'd his Grand|father would not keep his word with him, or that he &s;hould be him&s;elf de|tain'd within, or that he dur&s;t not play tricks with his Father <HI>Aureng-Zebe)</HI> would never hearken to any thing, nor enter into the Apartment
<PB N="103" REF="64">
of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> an&s;wering very clo&s;ely, that he had no order from his Father to go and &s;ee him, but that he was by him commanded not to return, without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortre&s;s, that &s;o he might come with all &s;afety to ki&s;s the Feet of his Maje&s;ty. There pa&s;&s;ed al|mo&s;t two whole days before he could re&s;olve to &s;urrender the Keys; during which time, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> &s;taid there, unalterable in his re&s;olutions, keeping him&s;elf upon his Guard night and day, with all his Troops about him; 'till at length <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> &s;eeing that all his People that were upon the Guard at the little Gate, little by little disbanded, and that there was no more &s;afety on his &s;ide, gave him the Keys, with an order to tell <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> that he &s;hould come pre&s;ently if he were wi&s;e, and that he had mo&s;t im|portant things to di&s;cour&s;e with him about. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was too cun|ning to commit &s;o gro&s;s a fault: On the contrary, he made his Eunuch <HI>Etbarkan</HI> Governour of the Fortre&s;s,
<PB N="104" REF="65">
who pre&s;ently &s;hut up <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> together with <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> and all his Women; cau&s;ing divers Gates to be walled up, that &s;o he might not be able to write or &s;peak to any body, nor go forth out of his Apartment without permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the mean time writ to him a little Note, which he &s;hew'd to every body before he &s;ealed it; in which, among other things, he told him with dry expre&s;&s;ions, that he knew from good hands, that notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e great prote&s;tations of e&s;teem and affection he made to him, and of contempt he made of <HI>Dara,</HI> he had, for all that, &s;ent to <HI>Dara</HI> two Elephants charged with Rupies of Gold, to rai&s;e him again, and to re|commence the War; and that there|fore, in truth, it was not he that im|pri&s;oned him, but <HI>Dara,</HI> and that he might thank him for it, as the cau&s;e of all the&s;e misfortunes; and if it had not been for him, he would have come the very fir&s;t day to him, and paid him all the mo&s;t dutiful re&s;pects he
<PB N="105" REF="65">
could have looked for from a good Son: That, for the re&s;t, he begged his pardon, and a little patience; as &s;oon as he &s;hould have di&s;enabled <HI>Dara</HI> from executing his evil De&s;igns, he would come him&s;elf and open the Gates to him.</P>
<P>I have heard it &s;aid concerning this Note, that <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> in very deed, the &s;ame night that <HI>Dara</HI> departed, had &s;ent to him the&s;e Elephants laden with Rupies of Gold, and that it was <HI>Rauchenara-Begum</HI> that found a way to di&s;cover it to <HI>Aureng-Zebe;</HI> as &s;he al&s;o had detected to him that Plot which was laid again&s;t him with tho&s;e <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> Women; and that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf had intercepted &s;ome Letters of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> to <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>I have conver&s;ed with others, that maintain there is no &s;uch thing, and that this Writing, which <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hew'd to all, was only to ca&s;t Sand into the Eyes of the People, and to labour, in &s;ome degree, to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf in &s;o &s;trange an action, and to devolve the Cau&s;e of it upon <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="66">
and <HI>Dara,</HI> as if he had been for|ced to &s;uch proceedings. They are things, which are difficult enough well to di&s;cover. However it be, as &s;oon as <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was &s;hut up, almo&s;t all the <HI>Omrahs</HI> were in a manner nece&s;&s;i|tated to go and make their Court to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Morad-Bakche;</HI> and (which is almo&s;t incredible) there was not one that had the courage to &s;tir, or to attempt the lea&s;t in the behalf of his King, and for him that had made them what they were, and rai&s;ed them from the du&s;t, and perhaps from &s;lavery it &s;elf (which is ordinary e|nough in that Court) to advance them to Riches and Honour. Yet &s;ome few there are, as <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> and &s;ome others, that took no &s;ide; but all the re&s;t declared for <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis notwith&s;tanding to be noted what I &s;aid, that they were nece&s;&s;i|tated to do what they did. For 'tis not in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as in <HI>France,</HI> or other States of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> where the Gran|dees and Nobles have large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions

<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> therefore having thus a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> took what Sums of Money he thought fit out of the Trea|&s;ury; and then having left <HI>Chah-he&s;t-Kan,</HI> his Uncle, Governour of the Town, he went away with <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> to pur&s;ue <HI>Dara.</HI></P>

better to prevent the &s;troke the &s;oone&s;t it might be; that he was only to for|bear going to vi&s;it him that day, ex|cu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition. But what&s;oever could be &s;aid to him, he believed nothing of it, his Ears were &s;topp'd to all the good advice that was given him, and as if he had been enchanted by the Friend&s;hip of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> he could not hold to go to him that very night, and to &s;tay at Supper with him. As &s;oon as he was come, <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who expected him, and had already prepared all things with <HI>Mirkan,</HI> and three or four of his mo&s;t intimate Captains, was not wan|ting in embracements, and in redou|bling his Court&s;hip, civilities and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions, in &s;o much as gently to pa&s;s his handkerchief over his face, and to wipe off his &s;weat and du&s;t, treating him &s;till with the Title of King and Maje&s;ty.

Bottle of excellent <HI>Chiras</HI> Wine, and &s;ome other Bottles of <HI>Caboul</HI> Wine, for a Debauch. Then <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as a grave &s;erious Man, and one that would appear a great Mahumetan, and very regular, nimbly ri&s;eth from Table, and having with much kind|ne&s;s invited <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> who loved a Gla&s;s of Wine very well, and who reli&s;h'd the Wine that was &s;erved, &s;crupled not to drink of it to exce&s;s. In a word, he made him&s;elf drunk, and fell a&s;leep. This was the thing that was wi&s;hed; for pre&s;ently &s;ome Servants of his that were there, were commanded away, under a pretence, to let him &s;leep without making any noi&s;e; and then his Zable and Ponyard were taken from about him: But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not long, but came him&s;elf and waken'd him. He entred into the Chamber, and roughly hit him with his foot, and when he be|gan to open a little his Eyes, he made to him this &s;hort and &s;urpri&s;ing Repri|mand: What means this, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> What &s;hame and what ignominy is

this, that &s;uch a King as you are, &s;hould have &s;o little temper, as thus to make him&s;elf drunk? What will be &s;aid both of you and me? Take this infamous Man, this Drunkard, tye him hand and foot, and throw him into that room to &s;leep out his Wine. No &s;ooner &s;aid, but it was executed; notwith&s;tanding all his appeal and out-cry, five or &s;ix per&s;ons fall upon him, and fetter his hands and feet. The things could not be done, but &s;ome of his Men that were thereabout had news of it. They made &s;ome noi&s;e, and would enter forcibly; but <HI>Allah-Couly,</HI> one of his chief Officers, and the Ma&s;ter of his Artillery, that had been gained long before, threa|tened them, and made them draw back. Without any delay, Men were &s;ent through the whole Army to calm this fir&s;t Commotion, which al&s;o might have proved dangerous; they made them believe it was nothing, they having been pre&s;ent, that <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> was only drunk, that in that condition he had railed at every body,
<PB N="112" REF="69">
and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf, in &s;o much that there had been a nece&s;&s;ity, &s;eeing him drunk and furious, to keep him apart; that the next day they would &s;ee him abroad, after he had dige&s;ted his Wine. In the mean time, the Pre&s;ents walked about all night a|mong&s;t the chief Officers of the Army, their Pay was forthwith increa&s;ed, they had great Promi&s;es made them; and as there was none, that had not long &s;ince apprehended &s;ome &s;uch thing, there was no great wonder to &s;ee almo&s;t all things quieted the next morning; &s;o that the very next night this poor Prince was &s;hut up in a little clo&s;e hou&s;e, &s;uch an one as is wont to be placed on Elephants to carry Wo|men, and he was carried directly to <HI>Dehli</HI> into <HI>Slimager,</HI> which is a little old Fortre&s;s in the mid&s;t of the River.</P>
<P>After that all was thus appea&s;ed, except the Eunuch <HI>Chah-Abas,</HI> who cau&s;ed difficulty enough, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> received the whole Army of <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> into his Service, and went after <HI>Dara,</HI> who marched apace towards

<HI>Lahor,</HI> with an intention well to for|tifie him&s;elf in that place, and thither to draw his Friends. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> followed him with &s;o much &s;peed, that he had not time to do any great matter, finding him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to retreat, and to take the way of <HI>Multan,</HI> where al&s;o he could do no|thing con&s;iderable, becau&s;e that <HI>Au|reng-Zebe,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the great heat, marched night and day; in &s;o much, that to encourage all to make ha&s;te, he &s;ometimes advanced almo&s;t all alone two or three leagues before the whole Army, finding him&s;elf of|ten obliged to drink ill water like others, to be content with a cru&s;t of dry bread, and to &s;leep under a Tree, &s;taying for his Army in the mid&s;t of the high-way, laying his Head on his Shield like a common Souldier. So that <HI>Dara</HI> found him&s;elf con&s;trained to abandon <HI>Multan</HI> al&s;o, that he might avoid being near <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> whom he was not able to encounter.

<P>This <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was come to en|camp in a little Village called <HI>Kadjoue,</HI> and had conveniently &s;eized him&s;elf of a great <HI>Talab,</HI> or Re&s;ervatory of Water, which is there in the way;

Between both was a very fair Campagne, very pro|per for a Battel. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was no &s;ooner arrived, but being impatient to end this War, at break of day he went to face <HI>Sujah,</HI> leaving his Bag|gage on the other &s;ide of the Torrent.

For he fore&s;aw, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> could not &s;tay there long, and that in that hot &s;ea&s;on he would be ab&s;olutely obliged to turn back towards the Torrent for the Water; and that, when he &s;hould do &s;o, he would fall upon his Rear. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> al&s;o fore&s;aw well enough the &s;ame thing, and that was the rea&s;on why he was &s;o forward and pre&s;&s;ing; but behold another more trouble&s;ome accident.</P>
<P>In this very time he receiveth intel|ligence, that the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> who in <HI>appearance</HI> had accommodated him&s;elf with him, was fallen upon his Rear, and plunder'd his Baggage and Trea&s;ure.

fallen into di&s;order. Yet he lo&s;es not his judgment for all this; and being well aware, that to turn back was to hazard all, he re&s;olved, as in the Bat|tel of <HI>Dara,</HI> to bear up the be&s;t he could, and to expect with a &s;teady foot all Events. In the mean time, the di&s;order grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e in his Army: <HI>Sujah,</HI> who was re&s;olved to profit of the occa&s;ion, taketh his time, and pre&s;&s;eth him vigorou&s;ly. He that led <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Elephant is killed with the &s;hot of an Arrow; he leads the Bea&s;t as well as he can him|&s;elf, 'till another could be had in that Leaders place. Arrows rain upon him; he returns many him&s;elf, his Elephant begins to be frighted, and to go back. Behold him now in great extremity, and brought to that point, that one foot of his was out of the &s;eat, as if he meant to ca&s;t him&s;elf to the ground; and no Man knows what in that trouble he had not done, if <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> being nigh, and perfor|ming, like a Great Man as he was, beyond imagination, called to him,

Mean time he received intelligence, that <HI>Sultan Su|jah</HI> had not lo&s;t many Men in his being routed, for want of farther pur&s;uit; that al&s;o from the Lands of the <HI>Raja's,</HI> which are in tho&s;e quarters, on the right and left of <HI>Ganges,</HI> he rai&s;ed great Forces, upon the &s;core of the repu|tation he had of being very rich, and very liberal, and that he fortified him|&s;elf
<PB N="128" REF="77">
in <HI>Elabas,</HI> that important and fa|mous Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Ganges,</HI> which with its Fortre&s;s is the fir&s;t In-let into <HI>Ben|gale.</HI> And then he con&s;idered al&s;o, that he had about him two Per&s;ons, which indeed were very capable to &s;erve him, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, and <HI>Emir-Jemla;</HI> but he well knew, that tho&s;e who have done good &s;ervice to their Prince, grow often in&s;olent, in the belief, that all is due to them, and that they cannot be re|compenced enough. He perceived al|ready, that the former of them began very much to emancipate him&s;elf, and that every day he became more arro|gant, for having &s;eized on the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Agra,</HI> and by that means had bro|ken all the De&s;igns which <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> could have formed. And as to the <HI>Latter,</HI> he knew indeed the force of his Under&s;tanding, his Conduct, and Valour; but that was the very thing which made him apprehend him the more: For knowing that he was very rich, that his reputation was great, that he pa&s;&s;ed for the <HI>Fir&s;t Mover</HI> in
<PB N="129" REF="77">
Affairs, and for the able&s;t Man in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> he doubted not, but that after the Example of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> he entertain'd him&s;elf with big hopes. All this certainly would have been able to perplex an ordinary Spirit, but <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> found a Remedy to all. He knew to remove them both with &s;o much prudence, and even with &s;o much hand&s;omne&s;s, that neither of them found any cau&s;e to complain of it. He &s;ent them both again&s;t <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> with a pui&s;&s;ant Army, letting <HI>Emir</HI> &s;ecretly know, that the Govern|ment of <HI>Bengale,</HI> which is the be&s;t quarter of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> was de&s;ign'd for him, to hold it during his life, and for his Son after his decea&s;e; and that thereby he would begin to expre&s;s to him his acknowledgments for the great Services he had done him; and that therefore it belonged only to him to defeat <HI>Sujah,</HI> and that as &s;oon as he &s;hould have compa&s;&s;ed it, he would make him <HI>Mir-ul Omrahs,</HI> which is the fir&s;t and the mo&s;t honourable place of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and no le&s;s than the Prince of the <HI>Omrahs.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="78">
To <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> his Son, he &s;aid only the&s;e few words: Remember that thou art the Elde&s;t of my Chil|dren, that 'tis for thy &s;elf thou goe&s;t forth to fight; that thou ha&s;t done much, but yet nothing, if thou over|come&s;t not <HI>Sujah,</HI> who is our greate&s;t and powerfulle&s;t Enemy; I hope, God a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, to be &s;oon Ma&s;ter of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them both, with ordinary honours, that is, with rich Ve&s;ts, &s;ome Hor&s;es and Ele|phants gallantly harne&s;&s;ed; making in the mean time <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> to con&s;ent, that his only Son, <HI>Mahmet-Emir-Kan,</HI> &s;hould &s;tay with him for a good Edu|cation, or rather for a Pledge of his Fidelity; and <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> that his Wife &s;hould remain in <HI>Agra</HI> (which was the Daughter of the above-men|tion'd King of <HI>Golkonda)</HI> as too trou|ble&s;ome a thing in an Army, and in &s;uch an Expedition.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who was always in the apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t the <HI>Raja's</HI> of the lower <HI>Bengale,</HI> which he had ill treated,

&s;hould be rai&s;ed again&s;t him, and who feared nothing more than to have to do with <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> had no &s;ooner received this News, but apprehen|ding that the pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Bengale</HI> would be ob&s;tructed, and that <HI>Emir</HI> would pa&s;s in &s;ome other place the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> either lower or higher than <HI>Elabas,</HI> rai&s;ed his Camp, and went down to <HI>Benares</HI> and <HI>Patna,</HI> whence he betook him&s;elf to <HI>Mogiere,</HI> a &s;mall Town &s;eated upon the <HI>Ganges,</HI> a place commonly call'd the <HI>Key</HI> of the King|dom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> being a kind of Streight between the Mountains and the Woods, which are not far from thence. He thought fit to &s;tay in that place, and there to fortifie him&s;elf; and for greater &s;afety, he cau&s;ed a great Trench to be made, which I have &s;een, pa&s;&s;ing that way &s;ome years after, from the Town and River unto the Mountain, being well re&s;olved there to attend <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> and to di&s;pute that pa&s;&s;age with him. But he was &s;ufficiently a&s;toni&s;h'd, when he was told, that the Troops of <HI>Emir,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="79">
which &s;lowly de&s;cended along the Ri|ver <HI>Ganges,</HI> were certainly for nothing but to amu&s;e him; that him&s;elf was not there; that he had gained the <HI>Raja's</HI> of tho&s;e Mountains, which are on the right hand of the River; and that he and <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> marched apace over their Lands with all the Flower of the Army, drawing &s;traight to <HI>Rage-Mehalle,</HI> to intercept him: So that he was con&s;trained to quit, as &s;oon as he could, his Fortifications; yet notwith&s;tanding he made &s;o much ha&s;te, that though he was obliged to follow tho&s;e windings, which the River <HI>Ganges</HI> on that &s;ide maketh to|ward the left hand, he prevented <HI>Emir</HI> by &s;ome days, and arrived fir&s;t at <HI>Rage-Mehalle,</HI> where he had time to fortifie him&s;elf; becau&s;e <HI>Emir</HI> having heard this News, took his March to the left hand towards <HI>Ganges,</HI> through very ill ways, there to expect his Troops, which came down with the Body of the Artillery and the Baggage along the River. As &s;oon as all was come, he went to attaque <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who
<PB N="133" REF="79">
defended him&s;elf very well for five or &s;ix days; but &s;eeing that the Artillery of <HI>Emir,</HI> which played ince&s;&s;antly, ruined all his Fortifications, which were made but of &s;andy Earth and Faggots, and that he could not but with much difficulty make re&s;i&s;tance in that place, be&s;ides that the Sea&s;on of the Rain began, he retired him&s;elf, at the favour of the night, leaving behind two great Peeces of Cannon. <HI>Emir</HI> dur&s;t not follow him in the night, for fear of &s;ome Ambu&s;h, putting off the pur&s;uit 'till the next morning: But <HI>Sujah</HI> had the good luck, that at the break of day there began to fall a Rain, which la&s;ted above three days; &s;o that <HI>Emir</HI> could not only not &s;tir out of <HI>Rage-Mehalle,</HI> but &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to pa&s;s the Winter there, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Rains in that Country, which render the ways &s;o trouble&s;ome for more than four months, <HI>viz. July, Augu&s;t, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> that the Armies cannot po&s;&s;ibly march. And hereby <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> had the means to retire him&s;elf, and to chu&s;e what
<PB N="134" REF="80">
place he would, having time enough to fortifie his Army, and to &s;end out of the inferiour <HI>Bengale</HI> for many Pee|ces of Cannon, and a good number of <HI>Portugals,</HI> that were retired thither, becau&s;e of the great fertility of the Countrey: For he much courted all tho&s;e <HI>Portugal</HI> Fathers, Mi&s;&s;ionaries, that are in that Province, promi&s;ing them no le&s;s than that he would make them all rich, and build Churches for them where&s;oever they would. And they were indeed capable to &s;erve him, it being certain, that in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale</HI> there are to be found no le&s;s than eight or nine thou&s;and Families of <HI>Franguis, Portugals,</HI> and the&s;e either Natives or Me&s;ticks.</P>
<P>But <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> who for the rea&s;on above-mentioned was grown fierce, and a&s;pired perhaps to greater things than at that time he ought, did pretend to command the Army ab&s;o|lutely, and that <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> &s;hould follow his Orders, letting al&s;o from time to time fall in&s;olent words in re|ference to his Father <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as
<PB N="135" REF="80">
if he were obliged to him for the Crown, and uttering Expre&s;&s;ions of contempt and threat again&s;t <HI>Emir-Jemla;</HI> which cau&s;ed great coldne&s;s betwixt them two, which la&s;ted a pretty while, until <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> under&s;tood, that his Father was very much di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct: And apprehending, le&s;t <HI>Emir</HI> had order to &s;eize on his per&s;on, he went away to <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> accompanied with a very &s;mall number, and to him he made great promi&s;es, and &s;wore fi|delity. But <HI>Sujah,</HI> who feared <HI>Au|reng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI>'s &s;nares, could not tru&s;t him, having always an Eye upon his Actions, without giving him any con&s;iderable Com|mand; which he &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted, that &s;ome months after, not knowing what would become of him, he left <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and returned to <HI>Emir,</HI> who re|ceived him well enough, a&s;&s;uring him, that he would write in his behalf to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and do his utmo&s;t to make him forget that fault.</P>
<P>I think fit here to take notice, on
<PB N="136" REF="81">
the by, of what many have told me, <HI>viz.</HI> That this E&s;cape of <HI>Sultan Mah|moud</HI> was altogether made by the Ar|tifices of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who cared not much to hazard this Son of his to try to de&s;troy <HI>Sujah,</HI> and who was glad enough, that whatever the Event were, he might have a &s;pecious pre|tence to put him in a place of &s;urety. However it be, he afterwards &s;hew'd him&s;elf much di&s;&s;atisfied with him, and wrote to him a &s;evere Letter, in which he enjoyn'd him to return to <HI>Dehli,</HI> but giving order in the mean time, that he &s;hould not come &s;o far: For he no &s;ooner had pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> but he met with Troops that &s;topp'd him, and put him up in a &s;mall Chair, (as was done to <HI>Morad-Bakche)</HI> and carried him to <HI>Goualeor,</HI> whence 'tis thought he will never be &s;et at liberty: <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> by this means freeing him&s;elf from great perplexity; who then al&s;o let his &s;econd Son, <HI>Sultan Mazum,</HI> know, that the point of Reigning is &s;o delicate a thing, that Kings mu&s;t be jealous even of their
<PB N="137" REF="81">
own &s;hadow; adding, that if he be not di&s;creet, the like may befall him what had befallen his Brother, and that he ought to think <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not a Man, that would &s;uffer that to be done to him&s;elf, what <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> did to his Father <HI>Jehan-Guyre,</HI> and what he had al&s;o lately &s;een done to <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed we may on this occa&s;ion &s;ay, that if this Son continue to be|have him&s;elf as he hath done hitherto, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> will have no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect him, and to be di&s;&s;atisfied with him: For no Slave can be more tra|ctable, and <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf never appear'd more carele&s;s of Greatne&s;s, nor more given to Devotion than he: Yet I have known Men of Parts, who believed, that he is not &s;o in good earne&s;t, but by &s;uperlative policy and craft, like that of his Father, which we may have the proof of in time.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t all the&s;e things were thus tran&s;acted in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> re&s;i&s;ted the be&s;t he could the Forces of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing now

on one &s;ide of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> of a Channel, or &s;ome other River, (for that Countrey is full of them) then on the other; <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> kept him|&s;elf about <HI>Agra,</HI> going to and fro; and at length, after he had al&s;o &s;ent <HI>Morad-Bakche</HI> to <HI>Goualeor,</HI> he came to <HI>Dehli,</HI> where in good earne&s;t he took upon him publickly to act the King, giving order for all Affairs of the Kingdom, and e&s;pecially thinking on means to catch <HI>Dara,</HI> and to get him out of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> which was a very hard thing, for the Rea&s;ons already mentioned. But the great good For|tune, and the &s;ingular dexterity of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;oon drew him thence; which now follows next to be re|lated.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> who had retired him|&s;elf to his Countrey, and made the be&s;t of what he had taken in the Battel of <HI>Kadjoue,</HI> rai&s;ed a &s;trong Army, and wrote to <HI>Dara,</HI> that he &s;hould come to <HI>Agra</HI> as &s;oon as he could, and that he would joyn with his Forces. <HI>Dara,</HI> who had by this time &s;et on foot a
<PB N="139" REF="82">
pretty numerous Army (though it con|&s;i&s;ted, for the mo&s;t part, but of ga|thered people) and who hoped, that approaching to <HI>Agra,</HI> many of his old Friends, &s;eeing him with <HI>Je&s;&s;om|&s;eigne,</HI> would not fail to joyn with him al&s;o, immediately leaveth <HI>Ama|devad,</HI> and marcheth with great &s;peed to <HI>A&s;mire,</HI> &s;even or eight days journey from <HI>Agra.</HI> But <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> kept not his word with him: The <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> interpo&s;ed to make his peace with <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to fa&s;ten him to his Party; or, at lea&s;t, to hinder his De&s;ign, which was capable to ruin him&s;elf, and to make all the <HI>Raja's</HI> ri&s;e; and wrote to him &s;everal Letters, gi|ving him to under&s;tand the great dan|ger he went to expo&s;e him&s;elf to, by e&s;pou&s;ing a Party in that extremity, as that of <HI>Dara</HI>'s was; that he &s;hould well con&s;ider what he was going to do; that he went about wholly to de|&s;troy him&s;elf, and all his whole Fa|mily; that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would never forgive him; that he was a <HI>Raja</HI> as him&s;elf; that he &s;hould think on &s;pa|ring
<PB N="140" REF="83">
the blood of the <HI>Ragipous;</HI> that if he thought to draw the <HI>Raja's</HI> to his Party, he would find tho&s;e that would hinder him from it. In a word, that it was a bu&s;ine&s;s which concern'd all the Gentry of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and expo&s;ed them to danger, if way were given to kindle a Fire, which would not be extingui&s;h'd at plea&s;ure. And la&s;tly, if he would leave <HI>Dara</HI> to him&s;elf, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> would forget all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and pre&s;ent him with all he had taken, and give him that very in&s;tant the Government of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> which would be very convenient for him, that Countrey being near his Lands; that he could be there in full liberty and &s;afety, and as long as he plea&s;ed, and that him&s;elf would be Caution for all. In a word, this <HI>Raja</HI> acted his part &s;o well, that he made <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne</HI> return to his Land, whil&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> approached with his whole Army to <HI>A&s;mire,</HI> and encamped in the &s;ight of that of <HI>Dara.</HI></P>
<P>And now what could this poor Prince <HI>Dara</HI> do? He &s;eeth him&s;elf
<PB N="141" REF="83">
abandoned, and fru&s;trated of his hopes. He con&s;iders, that to turn back &s;afe to <HI>Amadevad</HI> was impo&s;&s;ible, in regard that it was a March of thirty and five days; that it was in the heart of Summer; that water would fail him; that they were all the Lands of <HI>Raja's,</HI> Friends or Allies of <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> or <HI>Je&s;&s;om|&s;eigne;</HI> that the Army of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> which was not hara&s;&s;ed like his, would not fail to follow him. 'Tis as good, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> to peri&s;h here; and al|though the Match be altogether un|equal, let us venture all, and give Battel once more. But alas! what does he mean to do? He is not only abandoned by all, but he hath yet with him <HI>Chab-Navaze-Kan,</HI> whom he tru&s;ts, and who betrays him, and di&s;covers all his De&s;igns to <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> 'Tis true, that <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan</HI> was puni&s;h'd for his perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and killed in the Battel, whether it was by the hands of <HI>Dara</HI> him&s;elf, as many told me, or (which is more pro|bable) by &s;ome of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Army, who being &s;ecret Parti&s;ans of <HI>Dara,</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="84">
found means to get to him, and to di&s;patch him, fearing le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;cover them, and have &s;ome know|ledge of the Letters they had written to <HI>Dara.</HI> But what did it benefit him at that time, that <HI>Chah-Navaze-Kan</HI> was dead? <HI>Dara</HI> &s;hould have &s;ooner follow'd the advice of his Friends, and never have confided in him.</P>
<P>The Fight began between Nine and Ten of the Clock in the morning&punc; <HI>Dara</HI>'s Artillery, which was very well placed on a little eminency, was loud enough; but, as was &s;aid, mo&s;t of the Peeces without Bullets; &s;o was he be|tray'd by all! 'Tis needle&s;s to relate the other particulars of this Battel; it was properly not a Battel, but a Rout. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that hardly the On|&s;et was begun, but <HI>Je&s;&s;eigna</HI> was near and in &s;ight of <HI>Dara,</HI> to whom he &s;ent word, that he &s;hould fly pre&s;ently, unle&s;s he would be taken. So that this poor Prince, being altogether &s;urpri|&s;ed, was con&s;trained to run away in|&s;tantly, and with &s;o much di&s;order and precipitation, that he had not
<PB N="143" REF="84">
lei&s;ure to put up his Baggage. It was no &s;mall matter, that he was able to get away with his Wife, and the re&s;t of his Family. And 'tis eertain, that if the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne</HI> would have done what he could, he could never have e&s;caped; but he always had a re&s;pect to the Royal Family; or rather, he was too crafty and politick, and had too great foreca&s;t, to venture to lay hands on a Prince of the Blood.</P>
<P>This unfortunate Prince, de&s;erted by almo&s;t all, and finding him&s;elf ac|companied but of two thou&s;and Men at mo&s;t, was forced in the hotte&s;t of Summer to cro&s;s, without Tents or Baggage, all tho&s;e Countries of the <HI>Raja's,</HI> that are almo&s;t from <HI>A&s;mire</HI> to <HI>Amadevad.</HI> Mean time the <HI>Koullis,</HI> which are the Countrey People, and the wor&s;t of all the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the greate&s;t Robbers, follow him night and day, rifle and kill his Souldiers, with &s;o much cruelty, that no Man could &s;tay two hundred paces behind the Body, but he was pre&s;ently &s;tripp'd naked, or butcher'd upon the lea&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="85">
re&s;i&s;tance. Yet notwith&s;tanding, <HI>Dara</HI> made &s;hift to get near <HI>Amadevad,</HI> when he hoped, that the next day, or &s;oon after, he &s;hould enter into the Town to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and to try once more to gather again &s;ome Forces: But all things fall out contrary to vanqui&s;hed and unfortunate Men.</P>
<P>The Governour, whom he had left in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amadevad,</HI> had al|ready received both menacing and promi&s;ing Letters from <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> which made him lo&s;e courage, and incline to that &s;ide; in &s;o much that he wrote to <HI>Dara,</HI> forbidding him to come nearer, if he did, he would find the Gates &s;hut, and all in Arms.</P>
<P>Three days before I met this un|happy Prince, by a &s;trange accident, when he obliged me to follow him; having no Phy&s;itian about him; and the night before that he received this News from the Governour of <HI>Amade|vad,</HI> he did me the favour to make me come into the <HI>Karavan-Serrak</HI> where he was, fearing le&s;t the <HI>Koullis</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me; And (what is hard
<PB N="145" REF="85">
enough to believe in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> where the Crandees e&s;pecially are &s;o jealous of their Wives) I was &s;o near to the Wife of this Prince, that the Cords of the <HI>Kanates,</HI> or Wind-&s;creen, which enclo&s;ed them (for they had not &s;o much as a poor Tent) were fa&s;tened to the Wheels of my Chariot. I relate this circum&s;tance by the by only, to &s;hew the extremity <HI>Dara</HI> was redu|ced to.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Women heard this &s;ad news (which was at the break of day, as I well remember) they broke out upon a &s;udden into &s;uch &s;trange cryes and la|mentations, that they forced tears from ones Eyes. And now behold all was in an unexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion: Every one looks upon his neighbour, and no body knows what to do, or what will be|come of him. Soon after we &s;aw <HI>Dara</HI> come forth, half dead, now &s;peaking to one, then another, even to the meane&s;t Souldiers. He &s;eeth all a&s;toni&s;h'd, and ready to abandon him. What coun&s;el? whither can be go? he mu&s;t be gone in&s;tantly. You
<PB N="146" REF="86">
may judge of the extremity he mu&s;t needs be in, by this &s;mall accident I am going to mention. Of three great Oxen of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> which I had for my Chariot, one died the night be|fore, another was dying, and the third was tyred out (for we had been forced to march for three days toge|ther, almo&s;t night and day, in an in|tolerable heat and du&s;t:) Whatever <HI>Dara</HI> could &s;ay or command, whether he alledged it was for him&s;elf, or for one of his Women that was hurt in her Leg, or for me; he could not po&s;|&s;ibly procure for me, whether Oxe, or Camel, or Hor&s;e: So that he was obliged, to my good fortune, to leave me there. I &s;aw him march away, and that with tears in his Eyes, ac|companied with four or five hundred Cavaliers at mo&s;t, and with two Ele|phants, that were &s;aid to be laden with Gold and Silver; and I heard them &s;ay, that they were to take their march towards <HI>Tatabakar;</HI> for he had no other Game to play, though even that &s;eem'd in a manner impo&s;&s;ible,

con&s;idering the &s;mall number of people left him, and the great &s;andy De&s;arts to be waded through in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on, mo&s;t of them without water fit to drink.

<P><HI>Dara</HI> in the mean time approacheth to the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Tatabakar,</HI> and when he was but two or three days journey off, he received News, that <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> who had long held it be&s;ieged, had at length reduced it to extremity: As I afterwards learned of our <HI>French,</HI> and other <HI>Franguis</HI> that were there, a pound of Rice and Meat having co&s;t
<PB N="151" REF="88">
there above a Crown, and &s;o of other Victuals in proportion: Yet the Go|vernour held out; made Sallies, which extremely incommoded the Enemy; and &s;hew'd all po&s;&s;ible prudence, cou|rage, and fidelity; deriding the en|deavours of the General, <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> and all the menaces and promi&s;es of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI></P>
<P>And this al&s;o I learned afterwards of my Countrey-men, the <HI>French,</HI> and of all tho&s;e other <HI>Franguis</HI> that were with him; who added, that when he heard that <HI>Dara</HI> was not far off, he redoubled his liberalities, and knew &s;o well to gain the hearts of all his Souldiers, and to encourage them to do bravely, that there was not one of them, that was not re&s;olved to &s;ally out upon the Enemy, and to hazard all to rai&s;e the Siege, and to make <HI>Dara</HI> enter; and that he al&s;o knew &s;o well to ca&s;t fear and terrour into the Camp of <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> by &s;ending Spies about very cunningly to a&s;&s;ure, that they had &s;een <HI>Dara</HI> approach with great re&s;olution, and very good Forces;

that if he had come, as was believed he would do every moment, the Army of the Enemy was for disbanding upon his appearance, and even in part to go over to him. But he is &s;till too unfortunate, to undertake any thing pro&s;perou&s;ly. Believing therefore, that to rai&s;e the Siege with &s;uch an hand|ful of Men as he had was impo&s;&s;ible, he did deliberate to pa&s;s the River <HI>In|dus,</HI> and to endeavour to get into <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> although that al&s;o would have had mighty difficulties and inconve|niencies, by rea&s;on of the De&s;arts, and the &s;mall quantity of good waters in tho&s;e parts; be&s;ides, that upon tho&s;e Frontiers there are but mean <HI>Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> who acknowledge neither the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> nor the <HI>Mogol.</HI> But his Wife did very much di&s;wade him from it, for this weak rea&s;on, that he mu&s;t, if he did &s;o, expect to &s;ee his Wife and Daughter Slaves of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> that that was a thing al|together unworthy of the Grandeur of his Family, and 'twas better to dye, than to undergo this infamy.</P>

<HI>Dara,</HI> being in great perplexity, re|membred, that there was thereabout a certain <HI>Patan,</HI> powerful enough, called <HI>Gion-Kan,</HI> who&s;e Life he had formerly &s;aved twice, when <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> had commanded he &s;hould be ca&s;t under the feet of an Elephant, for having rebelled divers times: He re&s;olved to go to him, hoping that he could give him &s;ufficient Succours to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Tatabakar;</HI> ma|king account, that thence he would take his Trea&s;ure, and that going from thence, and gaining <HI>Kandahar,</HI> he could ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Kingdom of <HI>Caboul,</HI> having great hopes of <HI>Mo|habet-Kan,</HI> who was Governour of it, becau&s;e he was both potent and va|liant, well beloved of his Countrey, and had obtained this Government by his <HI>(Dara</HI>'s) favour. But his Grand|child, <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> yet but very young, &s;eeing his de&s;ign, ca&s;t him&s;elf at his Feet, intreating him for God's &s;ake, not to enter into the Countrey of that <HI>Patan.</HI> His Wife and Daugh|ter did the &s;ame, remon&s;trating to
<PB N="154" REF="90">
him, that he was a Robber, a revolted Governour, that he would infallibly betray him; that he ought not to &s;tand upon the rai&s;ing of the Siege, but rather endeavour to gain <HI>Caboul,</HI> that the thing was not impo&s;&s;ible, fora&s;much as <HI>Mir-baba</HI> was not like to quit the Siege to follow him, and to hinder him from getting thither.</P>
<P><HI>Dara,</HI> being carried head-long by the force of his unhappy De&s;tiny, re|jected this coun&s;el, and would hearken to nothing of what was propo&s;ed to him, &s;aying, as was true, that the March would be very difficult, and very dangerous; and maintaining al|ways, that <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> would not be &s;o mean, as to betray him, after all the good he had done him. He departed, notwith&s;tanding all that could be &s;aid to him, and went to prove, at the price of his Life, That no tru&s;t is to be given to a wicked Man.</P>
<P>This Robber, who at fir&s;t believed that he had numerous Troops follow|ing him, gave him the faire&s;t rece|ption that could be, and entertained
<PB N="155" REF="90">
him with very great kindne&s;s and civi|lity in appearance, placing his Soul|diers here and there among his Sub|jects, with a &s;trict order to treat them well, and to give them what refre&s;h|ments the Countrey afforded: But when he found that he had not above two or three hundred Men in all, he quickly &s;how'd what he was. It is not known, whether he had not re|ceived &s;ome Letters from <HI>Aureng Zebe,</HI> or whether his avarice had not been tempted by &s;ome Mules &s;aid to be laden with Gold; which was all that could be &s;aved hitherto, as well from the hands of Robbers, as of tho&s;e that conveyed it. Whatever it be, on a certain morning, when no body looked for any &s;uch thing, all being taken up with the care of refre&s;hing them|&s;elves, and believing all to be &s;afe; behold this Traitor, who had be&s;tirr'd him&s;elf all night to get armed Men from all parts, fell upon <HI>Dara</HI> and <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> killed &s;ome of their Men that &s;tood up to defend them&s;elves; forgot not to &s;eize on the loads of the

Mules, and of all the Jewels of the Women; made <HI>Dara</HI> to be tyed fa&s;t upon an Elephant, commanding the Executioner to &s;it behind, and to cut off his head upon the lea&s;t &s;ign given, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be &s;een to re&s;i&s;t, or that any one &s;hould attempt to deliver him. And in this &s;trange po&s;ture he was carried to the Army before <HI>Tata|bakar,</HI> where he put him into the hands of <HI>Mir-baba,</HI> the General, who cau&s;ed him to be conducted in the com|pany of this &s;ame Traitor to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and thence to <HI>Dehli.</HI></P>
<P>When he was at the Gates of <HI>Dehli,</HI> it was deliberated by <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> whether he &s;hould be made to pa&s;s through the mid&s;t of the City, or no, to carry him thence to <HI>Goualeor.</HI> Many did advi&s;e, that that was by no means to be done; that &s;ome di&s;order might ari&s;e; that &s;ome might come to &s;ave him; and be&s;ides, that it would be a great di&s;honour to the Family Royal. Others maintained the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould pa&s;s through the Town, to

a&s;toni&s;h the World, and to &s;hew the ab&s;olute Power of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to di&s;abu&s;e the People, that might &s;till doubt, whether it were him&s;elf, as in|deed many <HI>Omrahs</HI> did doubt; and to take away all hopes from tho&s;e, who &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome affection for him. The Opinion of the&s;e la&s;t was fol|lowed; he was put on an Elephant, his Grand-child, <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> at his &s;ide; and behind them was placed <HI>Bhadur-Kan,</HI> as an Executioner. This was none of tho&s;e brave Elephants of <HI>Ceilan</HI> or <HI>Pegu,</HI> which he was wont to ride on, with gilt Harne&s;s and em|broidered Covers, and Seats with Ca|nopies very hand&s;omely painted and gilt, to defend them&s;elves from the Sun: It was an old Caitiff Animal, very dirty and na&s;ty, with an old torn Cover, and a pitiful Seat, all open. There was no more &s;een about him, that Necklace of big Pearls, which tho&s;e Princes are wont to wear, nor tho&s;e rich Turbants and Ve&s;ts em|broider'd. All his Dre&s;s was a Ve&s;t of cour&s;e Linnen, all dirty, and a Tur|bant
<PB N="158" REF="92">
of the &s;ame, with a wretched Scarf of <HI>Kachimere</HI> over his head, like a Varlet; his Grand-&s;on, <HI>Sepe-Che|kouh,</HI> being in the &s;ame equipage. In this mi&s;erable po&s;ture he was made to enter into the Town, and to pa&s;s through the greate&s;t Merchant-&s;treets, to the end that all the People might &s;ee him, and entertain no doubt any more whether it was he.</P>
<P>As for me, I fancied we went to &s;ee &s;ome &s;trange Ma&s;&s;acre, and was a&s;toni&s;h'd at the boldne&s;s of making him thus pa&s;s through the Town; and that the more, becau&s;e I knew that he was very ill guarded, neither was I ignorant, that he was very much beloved by the lower &s;ort of people, who at that time exclaimed highly again&s;t the cruelty and tyranny of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> as one that kept his Father in pri&s;on, as al&s;o his own Son <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI> I was well prepar'd for it, and with a good Hor&s;e and two good Men I went, together with two others of my Friends, to place
<PB N="159" REF="92">
my &s;elf in the greate&s;t &s;treet, where he was to pa&s;s. But not one Man had the boldne&s;s to draw his Sword, only there were &s;ome of the <HI>Fakires,</HI> and with them &s;ome poor people, who &s;eeing that infamous <HI>Gion-Kan</HI> ride by his &s;ide, began to rail and throw &s;tones at him, and to call him Traitor. All the &s;hops were ready to break for the crowd of Spectators, that wept bitterly; and there was heard nothing but loud Out|cryes and Lamentations, Invectives, and Cur&s;es, heaped on <HI>Gion-Kan.</HI> In a word, Men and Women, great and &s;mall (&s;uch is the tenderne&s;s of the hearts of the <HI>Indians)</HI> were ready to melt into tears for compa&s;&s;ion; but not one there was that dur&s;t &s;tir to re&s;cue him.

<P>There were not wanting to tell <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> how the People at this &s;ight had lamented <HI>Dara,</HI> and cur&s;ed the <HI>Patan,</HI> that had deliver'd him&punc; and how the &s;ame was in danger to have been &s;toned to death, as al&s;o that
<PB N="160" REF="93">
there had been a great apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome &s;edition and mi&s;chief. Here|upon another Council was held, whe|ther he &s;hould indeed be carried to <HI>Goualeor,</HI> as had been concluded before; or whether it were not more expedient to put him to death, without more ado? Some were of opinion, that he &s;hould go to <HI>Goualeor</HI> with a &s;trong Guard, that that would be enough; <HI>Danechmend-Kan,</HI> though <HI>Dara</HI>'s old Enemy, in&s;i&s;ting much upon that. But <HI>Rauchenara-Begum,</HI> in pur&s;uance of her hatred again&s;t this Brother of hers, pu&s;hed <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> to make him a|way, without running the danger there was in &s;ending him to <HI>Goualeor;</HI> as al&s;o did all his old Enemies, <HI>Calil|ullah-Kan,</HI> and <HI>Chah-he&s;t-Kan,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially a certain Flatterer, a Phy&s;itian, who was fled out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> fir&s;t called <HI>Hakim-Daoud,</HI> and afterwards being be|come a great <HI>Omrah</HI> named <HI>Takarrub-Kan:</HI> This Villain boldly ro&s;e up in a full A&s;&s;embly, and cryed out, that it was expedient for the &s;afety of the State to put him to death immediately,
<PB N="161" REF="93">
and that the rather, becau&s;e he was no <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulman;</HI> that long &s;ince he was turn'd <HI>Kafire,</HI> Idolater, without Re|ligion, and that he would charge the Sin of it upon his own head: Of which imprecation he &s;oon after felt the &s;mart; for within a &s;hort time he fell into di&s;grace, and was treated like an infamous Fellow, and dyed mi&s;e|rably. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> carried a|way by the&s;e in&s;tances and motives, commanded that he &s;hould be put to death, and that <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> his Grand|child, &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>Goualeor.</HI></P>
<P>The Charge of this Tragical Exe|cution was given to a certain Slave, call'd <HI>Nazer,</HI> that had been bred by <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and was known to have been formerly ill treated by <HI>Dara.</HI> This Executioner, accompanied with three or four Parricides more, went to <HI>Dara,</HI> who was then him&s;elf dre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Lentils with <HI>Sepe-Chekouh</HI> his Grand|child. He no &s;ooner &s;aw <HI>Nazer,</HI> but cryed out to <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> My dear Son, behold tho&s;e that come to kill us! laying hold at the &s;ame time of
<PB N="162" REF="94">
a &s;mall Knife, which was all the Arms that were left him. One of the&s;e Butchers immediately fell upon <HI>Sepe-Chekouh;</HI> the others, upon the arms and legs of <HI>Dara,</HI> throwing him to the ground, and holding him under, 'till <HI>Nazer</HI> cut his throat. His Head was forthwith carried to the Fortre&s;s to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who pre&s;ently com|manded it to be put in a di&s;h, and that water &s;hould be fetch'd; which when brought, he wiped it off with an Handkerchief, and after he had cau&s;ed the Face to be wa&s;hed clean, and the blood done away, and was fully &s;atisfied that it was the very head of <HI>Dara,</HI> he fell a weeping, and &s;aid the&s;e words; Ah <HI>Bed-bakt!</HI> Ah unfor|tunate Man! Take it away, and bury it in the Sepulchre of <HI>Houmayon.</HI></P>
<P>At night, the Daughter of <HI>Dara</HI> was brought into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> but afterwards &s;ent to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> who asked her of <HI>Au|reng-Zebe.</HI> Concerning <HI>Dara</HI>'s Wife, &s;he had ended her days before at <HI>Lahor:</HI> She had poy&s;on'd her &s;elf, fore&s;eeing

the extremities &s;he was falling into, together with her Husband. <HI>Sepe-Chekouh</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Goualeor.</HI> And after a few days, <HI>Gion-kan</HI> was &s;ent for, to come before <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the A&s;&s;em|bly: To him were given &s;ome Pre|&s;ents, and &s;o he was &s;ent away; but being near his Lands, he was rewar|ded according to his de&s;ert, being killed in a Wood. This barbarous Man not knowing, or not con&s;idering, that if Kings do &s;ometimes permit &s;uch Actions for their Intere&s;t, yet they abhor them, and &s;ooner or later revenge them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Governour of <HI>Tatabakar,</HI> by the &s;ame Orders that had been required of <HI>Dara,</HI> was obli|ged to &s;urrender the Fortre&s;s. It was indeed upon &s;uch a compo&s;ition as he would have, but it was al&s;o with an intention not to keep word with him. For the poor Eunuch, arriving at <HI>Lahor,</HI> was cut in pieces, together with tho&s;e few Men he had then with him, by <HI>Kalil-ullah-kan,</HI> who was Go|vernour thereof. But the rea&s;on of
<PB N="164" REF="95">
the non-ob&s;ervance of the Capitula|tion was, that there was come intel|ligence, that he &s;ecretly prepar'd him|&s;elf to go directly to <HI>Soliman-Chekouh,</HI> &s;paring no Gold, which under-hand he conveyed into the hands of our <HI>Franguis,</HI> and to all tho&s;e that were come with him out of the Fortre&s;s to follow him, under pretext of accom|panying him as far as <HI>Dehli</HI> to <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who had often &s;aid, that he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee &s;o gallant a Man, and who had &s;o valiantly de|fended him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There remained therefore none of the Family of <HI>Dara,</HI> but <HI>Soliman-Che|kouh,</HI> who could not ea&s;ily be drawn away from <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> if the <HI>Raja</HI> had been &s;teady to his fir&s;t Declarations. But the &s;ecret practi&s;es of the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> the promi&s;es and threats of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> the death of <HI>Dara,</HI> and the other <HI>Rajas</HI> his Neighbours that had been gain'd, and were prepared by the Orders, and at the co&s;t of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to make War again&s;t him, did at la&s;t &s;hake the Faith of this perfidious
<PB N="165" REF="95">
Protector, and made him con&s;ent to their demands. <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> who was adverti&s;ed of it, fled through the mid&s;t of tho&s;e horrid Countries and fearful De&s;arts, towards the great <HI>Ti|bet.</HI> But the Son of the <HI>Raja,</HI> &s;oon pur&s;uing and overtaking him, cau&s;ed him to be a&s;&s;aulted with &s;tones. The poor Prince was hurt, &s;eized, and carried to <HI>Dehli,</HI> where he was im|pri&s;on'd in <HI>Serenguer,</HI> that little For|tre&s;s, where at fir&s;t they had put <HI>Morad-Bakche.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> to ob&s;erve what he had practi&s;ed towards <HI>Dara,</HI> and that no body might doubt it was <HI>Soliman-Chekouh</HI> him&s;elf, commanded him to be brought before him in the pre&s;ence of all the Grandees of the Court. At the entry of the Gate, the Chains were taken from his feet, leaving tho&s;e he had about his hands, which &s;eemed gilt. When this proper young Man, &s;o hand&s;ome and gallant, was &s;een to enter, there was a good num|ber of <HI>Omrahs</HI> that could not hold their tears; and, as I was informed, all
<PB N="166" REF="96">
the great Ladies of the Court, that had leave to &s;ee him come in, fell a weeping. <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who appear'd him&s;elf to be touched at his misfor|tunes, began to &s;peak very kindly to him, and to comfort him; telling him among&s;t other things, that he &s;hould fear nothing, that no hurt &s;hould be done to him; on the contrary, that he &s;hould be well treated, and there|fore be of good courage; that he had cau&s;ed his Father to be put to death for no other rea&s;on, than that he was turn'd <HI>Kafer,</HI> and a Man without Re|ligion. Whereupon this young Prince return'd him the <HI>Salem,</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed him, aba&s;ing his hands to the earth, and lifting them, as well as he could, up to his head, after the cu&s;tom of the Countrey; and told him with re&s;olution enough, That if he were to drink the <HI>Pou&s;t,</HI> he intreated him that he might dye pre&s;ently, being very willing to &s;ubmit to his Fate. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> promi&s;ed him publickly, that he &s;hould drink none of it; that he &s;hould re&s;t &s;atisfied as to that, and
<PB N="167" REF="96">
not entertain any &s;ad thoughts about it. This being &s;aid, he once more re|peated the <HI>Salem:</HI> And after they had asked him &s;everal Que&s;tions, in the Name of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> touching that Elephant which was charged with Roupies of Gold, taken from him when he went to <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> he was &s;ent to <HI>Goualeor</HI> to the re&s;t.

And 'tis that potion, which tho&s;e that are kept at <HI>Goualeor,</HI> are commonly made to drink; I mean tho&s;e Princes, who&s;e heads they think not fit to cut off: This is the fir&s;t thing that is brought them in the morning, and they have nothing given them to eat 'till they have drunk a great cup full of it; they would rather let them &s;tarve. This emaciates them exceedingly, and maketh them dye in&s;en&s;ibly, they lo|&s;ing little by little their &s;trength and under&s;tanding, and growing torpid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. And by this very means 'tis &s;aid, that <HI>Sepe-Chekouh,</HI> and the Grand|child of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> and <HI>Soliman-Chekouh,</HI> were di&s;pach'd.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="97">
As to <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> he was made away by a more violent death. For <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;eeing, that though he was in pri&s;on, yet the generality had an inclination to him, and that many Ver&s;es were &s;pread in the prai&s;e of his Valour and Courage, thought him|&s;elf not &s;afe enough by putting him to death in private, by giving him <HI>Pou&s;t</HI> like others; apprehending, that his Death would be &s;till doubted of, and that that might one time or other occa&s;ion &s;ome commotion, and there|fore devi&s;ed the following Charge a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Children of a certain <HI>Sayed,</HI> very rich, whom he had cau&s;ed to be put to death in <HI>Amadevad,</HI> to get his E&s;tate, when he there made his pre|parations for War, and borrowed or took by force great Sums of Money from all the rich Merchants, appeared in full A&s;&s;embly, making their com|plaints, and demanding Ju&s;tice, and the Head of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> for the Blood of their Father. Not one of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> dur&s;t contradict it, both be|cau&s;e

he was a <HI>Sayed,</HI> that is, one of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Kindred, to whom great Veneration was paid; and that every body &s;ufficiently under&s;tood the de|&s;ign of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> taking this for a pretence to rid him&s;elf openly of <HI>Morad-Bakche,</HI> under a &s;hew of Ju|&s;tice. So that the Head of him, that had killed the Father of the Plain|tiffs, was granted them without any other form of Proce&s;s. Whereupon they went, with nece&s;&s;ary Orders i&s;&s;ued out for that purpo&s;e, to cut it off in <HI>Goualeor.</HI></P>
<P>There remained no other Thorn in the Foot of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> but <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> who kept him&s;elf &s;till in <HI>Ben|gale;</HI> but he al&s;o was forced to yield at la&s;t to the power and fortune of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> There were &s;ent &s;o many Troops of all &s;orts to <HI>Emir-Femla,</HI> that at la&s;t he was encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, both on this and that &s;ide of the Ri|ver <HI>Ganges;</HI> &s;o that he was nece&s;&s;itated to flye to <HI>Dake,</HI> which is the la&s;t Town of <HI>Bengale</HI> on the Sea &s;ide; and here comes the conclu&s;ion of this whole Tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="98">
This Prince being de&s;titute of Ships to put to Sea, and not knowing whither to flye, &s;ent his elde&s;t Son, <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> to the King of <HI>Racan</HI> or <HI>Moy,</HI> a Heathen or Idolatrous King, to know whether he would give him leave to make his Countrey his place of refuge only for &s;ome time, and do him the favour, when the <HI>Mou&s;ons</HI> or the Sea&s;on-winds &s;hould come, to furni&s;h him with a Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Mecha,</HI> from thence to pa&s;s into &s;ome part of <HI>Turky</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> That King &s;ent an|&s;wer, that he &s;hould be very wel|come, and have all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance. So <HI>Sultan Banque</HI> returned to <HI>Dake</HI> with &s;ome Galea&s;&s;es, manned with <HI>Fran|guis</HI> (I mean, with tho&s;e fugitive <HI>Por|tugals,</HI> and other &s;traggling Chri&s;tians, that had put them&s;elves in &s;ervice to that King, driving no other Trade than to ravage all this lower <HI>Ben|gale;)</HI> upon which <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> em|barked, with his whole Family, <HI>viz.</HI> his Wife, his three Sons, and Daugh|ters. They were well enough recei|ved; whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for their
<PB N="171" REF="98">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;uch as that Countrey would afford, was provided for them, in the name of that King. Some months pa&s;s, the Sea&s;on of the fa|vourable Winds come in, but not a word of the Ve&s;&s;el, though he de|manded it no otherwi&s;e than for his Money; for as yet he wanted not Ru|pies of Gold, nor Silver, nor Gems: He had too great a plenty of them; his Riches were, in all appearance, the cau&s;e of his ruin, or at lea&s;t con|tributed much to it. Tho&s;e barbarous Kings have no true genero&s;ity, and are not much refrained by the Faith they have given, regarding nothing but their pre&s;ent Intere&s;ts, without &s;o much as con&s;idering the mi&s;chiefs that may befall them for their perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and brutality. To get out of their hands, one mu&s;t either be the &s;tronger, or have nothing that may tempt their avarice. <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> may long e|nough &s;ollicit for a Ve&s;&s;el; all is in vain, he effects nothing: On the con|trary, the King begins to &s;hew much coldne&s;s, and to complain of his not
<PB N="172" REF="99">
coming to &s;ee him. I know not, whether <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> thought it un|worthy of him&s;elf, and too mean a thing to give him a Vi&s;it; or rather, whether he fear'd, that being in the Kings Hou&s;e he might not there be &s;eized on, to take away all his Trea|&s;ure, and then be deliver'd into the hands of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> who for that purpo&s;e promi&s;ed, in the name of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> great Sums of Money, and many other con&s;iderable advan|tages. Whatever the matter was, he would not go thither him&s;elf, but &s;ent his Son <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> who being near the Kings Hou&s;e, began to &s;hew liberality to the people, throwing out to them a good quantity of half Ru|pies, and whole Rupies, of Gold and Silver. And being come before the King, he pre&s;ented him with &s;tore of Embroideries, and of rare pieces of Gold&s;miths-work, &s;et with precious Stones of great value, excu&s;ing his Father, <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> as being indi&s;|po&s;ed, and be&s;eeching him in his name, that he would remember the
<PB N="173" REF="99">
Ve&s;&s;el, and the promi&s;e made to him thereof. But all that did not advance his bu&s;ine&s;s; on the contrary, five or &s;ix days after, this King &s;ent to <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> to ask of him one of his Daugh|ters in Marriage; which he could never re&s;olve to grant him, whereat this barbarous Prince was highly of|fended. What then could he do in this ca&s;e? The Sea&s;on pa&s;&s;eth away. What &s;hall become of him? What other re&s;olution can he take, but to do a de&s;perate Action? Behold a &s;trange undertaking, which may give a great Example of what De&s;pair can do!</P>
<P>Although this King of <HI>Racan</HI> be an Heathen, yet there is in his Domi|nions &s;tore of <HI>Mahumetans</HI> mingled with the people, that are retired thi|ther, or have been, for the mo&s;t part, taken Slaves, here and there, by tho&s;e <HI>Franguis</HI> above-mention'd. <HI>Sultan Su|jah</HI> did under-hand gain the&s;e <HI>Mahu|metans;</HI> and with two or three hun|dred Men, whom he yet had remain|ing of tho&s;e that had follow'd him
<PB N="174" REF="100">
from <HI>Bengale,</HI> he re&s;olved, one day to fall unexpectedly upon the Hou&s;e of this Barbarian, to kill all, and to make him&s;elf proclaim'd King of <HI>Ra|can.</HI> This was a very bold Enterpri&s;e, and &s;uch a one, as had more of a <HI>De|&s;perado</HI> in it, than of a prudent Man. Yet notwith&s;tanding, as I was in|form'd, and by what I could learn from many <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that then were there pre&s;ent, the thing was fea&s;ible enough. But the day before the &s;troke was to be given, the De&s;ign was di&s;cover'd; which did altogether overthrow the Affairs of <HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> and was &s;oon after the cau&s;e of his ruin. For not finding hereafter any way more to re|cover him&s;elf, he attempted to flye towards <HI>Pegu;</HI> which was a thing in a manner impo&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t Mountains and Forre&s;ts to be pa&s;|&s;ed. Be&s;ides, he was immediately pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;e, that he was over|taken the &s;ame day he fled. It may well be thought, that he defended him&s;elf with as much courage as was
<PB N="175" REF="100">
po&s;&s;ible. He killed &s;o many of tho&s;e Barbarians, that it will &s;carce be be|lieved, but he was &s;o overpow'red by the multitude of pur&s;uers, that he was obliged to quit the Combat. <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> who was not &s;o far ad|vanced as his Father, defended him|&s;elf al&s;o like a Lion; but at length, being all bloody of the wounds, by &s;tones poured upon him from all &s;ides, he was &s;eized on, and carried away, with his two little Brothers, his Si|&s;ters, and Mother.</P>
<P>As to the Per&s;on of <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> him&s;elf, all what could be learnt of it, is this: That he, with one Woman, one Eunuch, and two other per&s;ons, got up to the Top of the Mountain; that he received a wound in his Head by a &s;tone, which &s;truck him down, but yet he ro&s;e again, the Eunuch having wound his Head about with his Turbant, and that they e&s;caped through the mid&s;t of the Woods.</P>
<P>I have heard the Relation three or four other manner of ways, even by tho&s;e per&s;ons that were upon the
<PB N="176" REF="101">
place. Some did a&s;&s;ure, that he had been found among the dead, but was not well known: And I have &s;een a Letter of the Chief of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fa|ctory, confirming this. So that 'tis difficult enough to know aright what is become of him. And this it is, which hath admini&s;tred ground to tho&s;e &s;o frequent Allarms, given us afterwards at <HI>Dehli:</HI> For at one time it was rumored, that he was arrived at <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> to joyn with the Kings of <HI>Golkonda</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;apour;</HI> another time it was related for certain, that he had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of <HI>Suratte</HI> with two Ships, bearing the Red Colours, which the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> or the King of <HI>Siam</HI> had given him; by and by, that he was in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and had been &s;een in <HI>Chiras,</HI> and &s;oon after in <HI>Kan|dahar,</HI> ready to enter into the King|dom of <HI>Caboul</HI> it &s;elf. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> one day &s;aid &s;miling, that <HI>Sultan Sujah</HI> was at la&s;t become an <HI>Agy</HI> or Pilgrim. And at this very day there are abun|dance of pet&s;ons who maintain, that he is in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> returned from <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="101">
whence he is &s;aid to have brought with him much Money. But that which confirms more than e|nough, that there is no ground for any of the&s;e reports, is that Letter of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> and that an Eunuch of his, with whom I travelled from <HI>Ben|gale</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> as al&s;o the Great Ma&s;ter of his Artillery, whom I &s;aw in the Service of the King of <HI>Gol|konda,</HI> have a&s;&s;ured me, that he is no more in being, though they made diffi|culty to &s;ay any more concerning him; as al&s;o, that our <HI>French</HI> Merchants, that lately came out of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and from <HI>Hi&s;pahan,</HI> when I was yet at <HI>Dehli,</HI> had in tho&s;e parts heard no news at all of him; be&s;ides that, I have heard that a while after his Defeat, his Sword and Poynard had been found: So that 'tis credible, that if he was not killed upon the place, he &s;oon dyed afterwards, and was the prey of &s;ome Robbers, or Tygers, or Ele|phants, of which the Forre&s;ts of that Countrey are full. However it be, after this la&s;t Action his whole Family
<PB N="178" REF="102">
was put in Pri&s;on, Wives and Chil|dren, where they were treated rudely enough; yet &s;ome time after they were &s;et at more liberty, and they received a milder entertainment: And then the King called for the elde&s;t Daughter, whom he married.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was doing, &s;ome Ser|vants of <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> joyned with divers of tho&s;e Mahumetans which I have mentioned, went to plot ano|ther Con&s;piracy like the fir&s;t. But the day appointed for it being come, one of the Con&s;pirators, being half drunk, began too &s;oon to break out. Con|cerning this al&s;o I have heard forty different relations, &s;o that 'tis very hard to know the truth of it. That which is undoubted is this, that the King was at length &s;o exa&s;perated a|gain&s;t this unfortunate Family of <HI>Sujah,</HI> that he commanded it &s;hould be quite rooted out. Neither did there remain any one of it, that was not put to death, &s;ave that Daughter which the King had made his Wife. <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> and his Brothers, had
<PB N="179" REF="102">
their Heads cut off with blunt Axes; and the Women were mured up, where they dyed of hunger and mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>And thus endeth this War, which the lu&s;t of Reigning had kindled a|mong tho&s;e four Brothers, after it had la&s;ted five or &s;ix years, from 1655, or thereabout, to 1660 or 1661; which left <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> in the peaceable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this pui&s;&s;ant Empire.</P>

<P>THe War being ended, the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Usbec</HI> entertained thoughts of &s;ending Am|ba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> They had &s;een him fight in their Countrey, when he was yet a young Prince; <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> having &s;ent him to command the Succours, which the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Samarkand</HI> had de&s;ired of him again&s;t the <HI>Kan</HI> of <HI>Balk.</HI> They had experienced his Conduct and Valour
<PB N="2" REF="106">
on many occa&s;ions, and they con&s;i|der'd with them&s;elves, that he could not but remember the Affront they did him, when he was ju&s;t taking <HI>Balk,</HI> the Capital Town of the Enemy: For the two <HI>Kans</HI> agreed together, and obliged him to retreat, alledging, that they apprehended he might render him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of their whole State, ju&s;t as <HI>Ekbar</HI> had formerly done of the Kingdom of <HI>Kachimere.</HI> Be&s;ides, they had certain intelligence of all he had done in <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> of his Battels, For|tune, and Advantages; whence they might &s;ufficiently e&s;timate, that though <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was yet living, yet <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was Ma&s;ter, and the only Per&s;on that was to be owned King of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Whether then they feared his ju&s;t re&s;entments, or whether it was, that their inbred avarice and &s;ordid|ne&s;s made them hope for &s;ome con&s;ide|rable Pre&s;ent, the two <HI>Kans</HI> &s;ent to him their Amba&s;&s;adors to offer him their Service, and to congratulate him upon the happy beginning of his Reign. <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;aw very well,
<PB N="3" REF="106">
that the War being at an end, this offer was out of &s;ea&s;on, and that it was nothing but fear or hope, as we &s;aid, that had brought them. Yet for all this, he received them honourably; and, &s;ince I was pre&s;ent at their Au|dience, I can relate the particulars of it with certainty.</P>
<P>They made their reverence at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from him, after the <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tom, putting thrice their hands upon their heads, and as often let|ting them down to the ground. Then they approached &s;o near, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> him&s;elf might very well have taken their Letters immediately from their hands; but yet it was an <HI>Omrah</HI> that took and open'd them, and gave them to him. He forthwith read them with a very grave countenance; and afterwards commanded, there &s;hould be given to each of them an em|broider'd Ve&s;t, a Turbant, and a Girdle of Silk in Embroidery, which is that which they call <HI>Ser-apah,</HI> that is, an Habit from head to foot. After this, their Pre&s;ents were call'd for, which
<PB N="4" REF="107">
con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome Boxes of choice <HI>Lapis Lazulus,</HI> divers Camels with long hair, &s;everal gallant Hor&s;es, &s;ome Camel|loads of fre&s;h Fruit, as Apples, Pears, Rai&s;ins and Melons; (for 'tis chiefly <HI>Usbec</HI> that furni&s;hes the&s;e &s;orts of Fruit, eaten at <HI>Dehli</HI> all the Winter long;) and in many loads of dry Fruit, as Prunes of <HI>Bokara,</HI> Aprecocks, Rai&s;ins without any &s;tones that appeared, and two other &s;orts of Rai&s;ins, black and white, very large and very good.</P>
<P><HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was not wanting to declare, how much he was &s;atisfied with the Genero&s;ity of the <HI>Kans,</HI> and much commended the beauty and ra|rity of the Fruit, Hor&s;es, and Ca|mels; and after he had a little enter|tain'd them of the &s;tate of the Aca|demy of <HI>Samarkand,</HI> and of the Fer|tility of their Countrey, abounding in &s;o many rare and excellent things, he de&s;ired them to go and repo&s;e them|&s;elves, intimating withall, that he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee them often.</P>
<P>They came away from their Au|dience full of contentment and joy,
<PB N="5" REF="107">
not being much troubled, that they had been obliged to make their reve|rence after the <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tome, though it have &s;omething of &s;lavi&s;h in it; nor much re&s;enting it, that the King had not taken their Letters from their own hands. I believe if they had been re|quired to ki&s;s the ground, and even to do &s;omething of a lower nature, they would have complied with it. 'Tis true, it would have been in vain, if they had de&s;ired to make no other &s;alute, but that of their own Coun|trey, and to deliver to the King their Letters with their own hands; for that belongs only to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> nor have the&s;e this favour granted them, but with much diffi|culty.</P>
<P>They &s;tay'd above four months at <HI>Dehli,</HI> what diligence &s;oever they could u&s;e to be di&s;patch'd, which did incommode them very much; for they fell almo&s;t all &s;ick, and even &s;ome of them dyed, becau&s;e they were not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch heats as are in <HI>In|do&s;tan,</HI> or rather becau&s;e they were
<PB N="6" REF="108">
&s;ordid, and kept a very ill Diet. I know not whether there be a more avaricious and uncleanly Nation than they are. They laid up the Money, which the King had appointed them for their maintenance, and lived a very mi&s;erable life, altogether unwor|thy of Amba&s;&s;adors: Yet they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with great honour: The King, in the pre&s;ence of all the <HI>Om|rahs,</HI> pre&s;ented each of them with two rich <HI>Ser-apahs,</HI> and gave order, that eight thou&s;and Rupies &s;hould be carried to their Lodgings, which amounted to near two thou&s;and Crowns each. He al&s;o gave them, for Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Kans</HI> their Ma&s;ters, very hand&s;om <HI>Ser|apahs,</HI> &s;tore of the riche&s;t and be&s;t wrought Embroideries, a good quan|tity of fine Cloth, and &s;ilk Stuffs, wrought with Gold and Silver, and &s;ome Tape&s;tries, and two Poynards &s;et about with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>During their &s;tay, I went thrice to &s;ee them, being pre&s;ented to them as a Phy&s;itian by one of my Friends, that was Son of an <HI>Usbec,</HI> that had
<PB N="7" REF="108">
made his Fortune in that Court. I had a de&s;ign to have learned &s;omething in particular of their Countrey, but I found them &s;o ignorant, that they knew not &s;o much as the Confines of their State, much le&s;s could they in|form me of any thing concerning the <HI>Tartars</HI> that have conquer'd <HI>China</HI> of late years: In &s;hort, they told me no|thing that I knew not before. I had once the curio&s;ity to Dine with them, which liberty I obtained ea&s;ily enough. They are not Men of much ceremony; it was a very extraordinary Meal for &s;uch a one as I, it being meer Hor&s;e|fle&s;h; yet for all this I got my Dinner with them; there was a certain Ra|gou, which I thought pa&s;&s;able: And I was obliged to expre&s;s a liking of &s;o exqui&s;it a di&s;h, which they &s;o much lu&s;t after. During Dinner there was a &s;trange &s;ilence; they were very bu&s;ie in carrying in with their whole hands, for they know not what a Spoon is; but after that this Hor&s;e|fle&s;h had wrought in their &s;tomachs, they began to talk, and then they
<PB N="8" REF="109">
would per&s;wade me, they were the mo&s;t dextrous at Bows and Arrows, and the &s;tronge&s;t Men in the World. They call'd for Bows, which are much bigger than tho&s;e of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> and would lay a wager, to pierce an Oxe or my Hor&s;e through and through. Then they proceeded to commend the &s;trength and valour of their Women, which they de&s;cribed to me quite otherwi&s;e than the <HI>Amazons;</HI> telling me very wonderful &s;tories of them, e&s;pecially one, which would be ad|mirable indeed, if I could relate it with a <HI>Tartarian</HI> Eloquence, as they did: They told me, that at the time when <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made War in their Countrey, a Party of Twenty five or Thirty <HI>Indian</HI> Hor&s;emen came to fall upon a &s;mall Village; whil&s;t they plundred, and tyed all tho&s;e whom they met with to make them Slaves, an old Woman &s;aid to them: Chil|dren, be not &s;o mi&s;chievous, my Daughter is not far off, &s;he will be here very &s;hortly, retreat if you be wi&s;e, you are undone if &s;he light upon
<PB N="9" REF="109">
you. They laughed at the old Wo|man, and her advice, and continued to load, to tye, and to carry away her &s;elf; but they were not gone half a Mile, but this old Woman, looking often backward, made a great out-cry of joy, perceiving her Daughter coming after her on Hor&s;e-back; and pre&s;ently this generous She-<HI>Tartar,</HI> mounted on a furious Hor&s;e, her Bow and Arrows hanging at her &s;ide, called to them at a di&s;tance, that &s;he was yet willing to give them their Lives, if they would carry back to the Village all they had taken, and then with|draw without any noi&s;e. The ad|vice of this young Woman affected them as little as that of her old Mo|ther; but they were &s;oon a&s;toni&s;h'd, when they found her let fly at them in a moment three or four great Ar|rows, which &s;truck as many of their Men to the ground, which forced them to fall to their Quivers al&s;o.

<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Tartary</HI> were not yet gone away from <HI>Dehli,</HI> when <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> fell exceeding &s;ick; a vio|lent and continued Fever made him &s;ometimes lo&s;e his under&s;tanding: His tongue was &s;eized with &s;uch a Pal&s;ie, that he lo&s;t almo&s;t his &s;peech, and the Phy&s;itians de&s;paired of his recovery; nothing was heard for the time, than that he was gone, and that his Si&s;ter <HI>Rauchenara-Begum</HI> concealed his death out of de&s;ign. It was already bruited, that the <HI>Raja Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne,</HI> Governour of <HI>Guzaratte,</HI> was on the way to de|liver <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> that <HI>Mohabet-Kan</HI> (who had at length obeyed the Orders of <HI>Aureng-Zebe)</HI> quitting the Govern|ment

On one &s;ide we &s;ee <HI>Sultan Mazum</HI> be&s;tir him&s;elf exceedingly with bribes, en|deavouring by promi&s;es to a&s;&s;ure him|&s;elf of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;o far as that one night he went di&s;guized to the Raja <HI>Je&s;&s;eigne,</HI> entreating him with expre&s;|&s;ions of deep re&s;pect, that he would engage him&s;elf for his intere&s;t.</P>

Grandees had any &s;uch thing in their thoughts, &s;preading this rumour only to gain credit and concour&s;e, and be|cau&s;e they feared, lea&s;t by the means of <HI>Etbar-kan,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;ecret in|trigue, he &s;hould one day appear in the Field. And indeed of all the par|ties, there was not one that had rea&s;on to wi&s;h for his liberty and re&s;toration to the Throne, except <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eigne, Mohabet-kan,</HI> and &s;ome others, that as yet had done no great matter to his di&s;advantage. The re&s;t had been all again&s;t him, at lea&s;t they had vilely abandon'd him. They knew very well he would be like an unchain'd Lyon, if he came abroad: Who then could tru&s;t him? And what could <HI>Etbar-kan</HI> hope for, who had kept him up &s;o clo&s;e? I know not, if by &s;ome adven|ture or other, he &s;hould have come out of pri&s;on, whether he would not have &s;tood &s;ingle, and been alone of his party.</P>
<P>But though <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> was very &s;ick, yet for all this he gave order for all things, and particularly for the

&s;ure cu&s;tody of <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> his Father; and though he had advi&s;ed <HI>Sultan Ma|zum</HI> to go and open the Gates to <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould die, yet he omitted not to have <HI>Etbar-kan</HI> ince&s;|&s;antly writ to.

The &s;eventh, ninth, and tenth day, he made him&s;elf to be car|ried again into the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and, what is almo&s;t incredible, the thirteenth, after he had recollected him&s;elf from a fit of &s;wounding, which acca&s;ioned a rumor through the whole Town of his being dead, he called for two or three of the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and the Raja <HI>Je&s;|&s;eigne,</HI> to let them &s;ee that he was alive; made him&s;elf to be rai&s;ed in his bed, called for Ink and Paper to write to <HI>Etbar-kan,</HI> and &s;ent for the Great Seal;

<P>He had no &s;ooner recover'd his health, but he &s;ought to get out of the hands of <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> and <HI>Begum-Saheb,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Dara,</HI> to &s;ecure the marriage of <HI>Sultan-Ekbar,</HI> his third Son, with this Prince&s;s; on purpo&s;e thereby to gain him Authority, and to give him the greater right to the Em|pire; For he it is, who is thought to be by him de&s;igned for it.

The&s;e Kings, though Mahumetans, do, for all that, marry of the Daughters of the Heathen, either for State-inte|re&s;t, or for extraordinary Beauty. But <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> was di&s;appointed in this de&s;ign; It will hardly be believed, with what height and fiercene&s;s of &s;pirit <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> and <HI>Begum</HI> rejected the Pro|po&s;ition, and the Young Prince&s;s her &s;elf, who in the fear of being carried away, was for &s;ome days de&s;perate, and prote&s;ted &s;he would rather kill her &s;elf an hundred times over, if it were po&s;&s;ible, than to marry the Son of him that had murthered her Father.</P>
<P>He had no better &s;atisfaction from <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> about certain Jewels which he asked of him, in order to fini&s;h a piece of work which he cau&s;ed to be added to a famous Throne, which is &s;o highly e&s;teemed. For he fiercely an&s;wer'd, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hould take

no other care but to rule better then he did; that he &s;hould let his Throne a|lone; that he was weary to hear of the&s;e Jewels, and that the Hammers were ready to beat them to du&s;t the fir&s;t time he &s;hould be importun'd again about them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not be the la&s;t in doing reverence to <HI>Aureng-Zebe&punc;</HI> they had thoughts of &s;ending an Am|ba&s;&s;ador to him. They pitched upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>Adrican,</HI> the Commander of their Factory at <HI>Suratte;</HI> and being a right hone&s;t man, and of good &s;en&s;e and judgment, not neglecting to take the coun&s;el of his friends, he well ac|quitted him&s;elf of this employment. <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> though he carries it very high, and affects to appear a zealous Mahumetan, and con&s;equently to di&s;|pi&s;e the <HI>Franguis</HI> or Chri&s;tians, yet thought fit to receive them with much re&s;pect and civility. He even was de|&s;irous, that this Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould complement him in the mode of the <HI>Franguis,</HI> after he had been made to do it the <HI>Indian</HI> way. 'Tis true, he recei|ved

his Letters by the hand of an <HI>Omrah;</HI> but <HI>that</HI> was not to be taken for any contempt, he having &s;hew'd no more honour to the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Usbec.</HI> After this, he intimated to him, that he might produce his Pre&s;ent; and at the &s;ame time he cau&s;ed him, and &s;ome of his Train, to be dre&s;&s;ed with a <HI>Ser-Apah</HI> embroider'd. The Pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;i&s;ted of &s;tore of very fine Scarlet, &s;ome large Looking-gla&s;&s;es, and divers excellent pieces of Chine&s;e and Japone&s;e work, among which there was a <HI>Paleky,</HI> and a <HI>Tackravan,</HI> or a Field-Throne of admirable work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P>This Amba&s;&s;adour was not &s;o &s;oon di&s;patch't as he wi&s;h'd, it being the cu&s;tom of the Kings of <HI>Mogol</HI> to detain Amba&s;&s;odours as long as they well can, from a belief they have, that 'tis the intere&s;t of their Greatne&s;s, to oblige Strangers to give long attendance at their Court; yet he was not kept &s;o long as the Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Usbec.</HI> Mean time he had the misfortune, that his Secretary died there, and the re&s;t

of his Retinue began to grow &s;ick. When the King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, he gave him &s;uch another <HI>Ser-Apah</HI> embroi|der'd, as the fir&s;t was for him&s;elf; and another, a very rich one, for the General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> together with a Poynard, &s;et about with Jewels, all accompanied with a very obliging Letter.</P>
<P>The chief aim of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in this Emba&s;&s;y was, to make them&s;elves immediately known to the King, there|by to gain credit, and to intimidate the Governours of the Sea-ports, and o|ther places, where they have their Factories; that &s;o they may not at|tempt, when they plea&s;e, to in&s;ult over them, or to trouble them in their Trade; thereby letting them know, that they had to do with a potent Na|tion, and that hath a door open to ad|dre&s;s them&s;elves, and to complain immediately to the King. Their end al&s;o was, to make it appear, what intere&s;t the King had in their Com|merce; and therefore they &s;hew'd long Rolls of Commodities, bought up by them through the whole Kingdom,

and Li&s;ts of con&s;iderable &s;ums of Gold and Silver, every year brought thither by them; but &s;aying not a word of tho&s;e which they draw thence, from the Copper, Lead, Cinamon, Cloves, Mu&s;cadin, Pepper, Wood of Aloes, Elephants, and other Commodities which they vend there.</P>
<P>About this time, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Omrah</HI>'s of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to him, and repre|&s;ented, that this multitude and variety of perplexing affairs, and this perpe|tual attention of mind in him, might &s;oon cau&s;e a great alteration in his temper, and a dangerous inconveni|ence in his health.

<P>At the &s;ame time there happen'd an accident, that made a great noi&s;e at <HI>Dehli,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Seraglio, and di&s;abu&s;ed a great many, that could as hardly believe as my &s;elf, that Eunuchs, though they had their Genitals quite cut away, could become amorous as other men. <HI>Didar-kan,</HI> one of the chief Eunuchs of the Seraglio, who had built an hou&s;e, where he came often to divert him&s;elf, fell in love with a very beautiful Woman, the Si&s;ter of a Neighbour of his, that was an Hea|then Scrivener.</P>
<P>The&s;e Amours la&s;ted a good while before any body blamed them, &s;ince it was but an Eunuch that made them, which &s;ort of men have the priviledge to go where they plea&s;e; but the

familiarity grew &s;o great, and &s;o extra|ordinary betwixt the two Lovers, that the Neighbours began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome|thing, and to rally the Scrivener, which did &s;o touch him, that he threatned both his Si&s;ters and the Eunuch to kill them if they &s;hould continue their commerce. And &s;oon after, finding them in the night lying together, he &s;tabbed the Eunuch out-right, and left his Si&s;ter for dead. The whole Seraglio, Women and Eunuchs, made a league together again&s;t him to make him away; but <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> di&s;&s;ipated all the&s;e machinations, and was con|tent to have him turn Mahumetan. Mean time 'tis thought, he cannot long avoid the malice and power of the Eunuchs; for 'tis not, as is the com|mon &s;aying, with Men as with Bruits; the&s;e latter become gentler and more tractable when they are ca&s;trated; but men more vicious, and commonly very in&s;olent, though &s;ometimes it turneth to an admirable fidelity and gallantry.</P>

The matter was related to me by an old Portugue&s;e Woman (that had a long while been &s;lave to the Sera|glio, and went out and in at plea&s;ure) as followeth: She told me that <HI>Rauche|nara-Begum,</HI> after &s;he had drawn from a young man, hidden by her, all his abillty, deliver'd him to &s;ome Women to convey him away in the night tho|rough &s;ome Gardens, and &s;o to &s;ave him: But whether they were di&s;co|ver'd, or whether they feared they &s;hould be &s;o, or what el&s;e might be the cau&s;e, they fled, and left him there wandring in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Gar|dens, not knowing which way to get

out: And being at la&s;t met with, and brought before <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> who ex|amined him &s;trictly, but could draw nothing el&s;e from him, than that he was come in over the walls, he was commanded to get out the &s;ame way by which he entred: But it &s;eems, the Eunuchs did more than <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had given order for, for they ca&s;t him down from the top of the walls to the bottom. As for the other Young Gal|lant, this &s;ame Woman a&s;&s;ured me, that he was found wandring in the Garden like the fir&s;t, and having con|fe&s;&s;ed that he was come in by the Gate, <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> commanded likewi&s;e, that he al&s;o &s;hould pa&s;s away again by the &s;ame Gate; yet re&s;erving to him&s;elf a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement for the Eunuchs, &s;ince not only the honour of the Royal Hou&s;e, but al&s;o the &s;afety of the Kings per&s;on is herein concerned.</P>

The two remaining Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent from the King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> To the three fir&s;t no great regard was given; they appear'd in &s;o mi&s;erable and con|fu&s;ed an Equipage, that it was percei|ved they came only to get &s;ome money by the means of their Pre&s;ent, and of the many Hor&s;es and other Merchan|di&s;e, which under the pretence of Amba&s;&s;adors, entred without paying any duty into the Kingdom, there to be &s;old, and to buy for the money a quantity of Indian Stuffs, and &s;o to return without paying likewi&s;e any Impo&s;t at all.</P>
<P>But as to the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Emba&s;&s;y, that de&s;erves to be otherwi&s;e taken notice of; the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> having recei|ved the news of the Revolution of the <HI>Indies,</HI> had a de&s;ign to &s;pread his Name in tho&s;e parts, and there to make known his Grandeur and Magnificence by a &s;plendid Emba&s;&s;y; or, as malice will

have it, or rather as the very truth is, to reap &s;ome advantage by a pre&s;ent as well as the re&s;t. Behold therefore this great Emba&s;&s;y! He cho&s;e for his Am|ba&s;&s;adors two per&s;ons, that one would think were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in his Court, and the mo&s;t capable to make &s;uch a de&s;ign pro&s;per. And who were they? the <HI>one</HI> was a Mahumetan Mer|chant, whom I had &s;een &s;ome years ago at <HI>Moka,</HI> when I pa&s;&s;ed there coming out of <HI>Egypt</HI> over the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> where he was to &s;ell &s;ome Slaves for that Prince, and to buy of the money, rai&s;ed thence, &s;ome Indian Commodities. And this is the fine Trade of that Great <HI>Christian</HI> King of <HI>Africa.</HI> The <HI>other</HI> was a Chri&s;tian Merchant of <HI>Armenia,</HI> born and married in <HI>Aleppo,</HI> known in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> by the name of <HI>Murat.</HI> I had &s;een him al&s;o at <HI>Moka,</HI> where he had accomodated me with the half of his Chamber, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with very good advice, whereof I have &s;poken in the beginning of this Hi&s;tory, as a thing taking me off from pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> according to my fir&s;t de&s;ign.

He al&s;o came every year to that place, in that Kings Name, for the &s;ame end that the Mahumetan did, and brought the Pre&s;ent which the King made eve|ry year, to the Gentlemen of the Engli&s;h and Dutch Company of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and carried away theirs. Now the King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;utably to his de&s;ign, and the de&s;ire he had of making his Amba&s;&s;adors appear with great &s;plendour, put him&s;elf to great expences for this Emba&s;&s;ie: He gave them thirty two young Slaves, of both Sexes, to &s;ell them at <HI>Moka,</HI> and thence to make a &s;um of Money to bear their Charges. A wonderful large&s;s! Slaves are commonly &s;old there for twenty five or thirty Crowns a piece, one with another. A con&s;iderable &s;um. Be|&s;ides, he gave them for a Pre&s;ent to the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> five and twenty choice Slaves, among which there were nine or ten very young, proper to make Eu|nuchs of. A very worthy Pre&s;ent for a King, and he a Chri&s;tian, to a Ma|humetan Prince! It &s;eems the Chri|&s;tianity of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> is very diffe|rent
<PB N="28" REF="119" MS="y">
from ours. He added to that Pre&s;ent, twelve Hor&s;es, e&s;teem'd as much as tho&s;e of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and a kind of little Mule, of which I &s;aw the Skin, which was a very great Rarity, there being no Tyger &s;o hand&s;omely &s;peck|led, nor Silken Stuff of <HI>India</HI> &s;o finely, &s;o variou&s;ly, and &s;o orderly &s;treaked, as that was. Moreover, there were for a part of the Pre&s;ent, two Ele|phants Teeth, &s;o prodigious, that they a&s;&s;ured it was all that a very able-bo|died man could do to lift up one of them from the ground. La&s;tly, an Horn of an Oxe full of Civett, and &s;o big, that the aperture of it being mea&s;ur'd by me, when it came to <HI>Deh|li,</HI> it had a Diameter of half a Foot, and &s;omewhat better. All things be|ing thus prepared, the Amba&s;&s;adors depart from <HI>Gondez,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;ituated in the Province of <HI>Dambea,</HI> and came through a very trouble&s;ome Countrey to <HI>Beiloul,</HI> which is a di&s;peopled Sea-Port over again&s;t <HI>Moka,</HI> nigh to <HI>Babel-mandel,</HI> not da|ring to come (for rea&s;ons el&s;where to

know not how long, with your fine Philo&s;ophy, all I retained of it, was a multitude of barbarous and dark words, proper to bewilder, perplex, and tire out the be&s;t wits, and only invented, the better to cover the va|nity and ignorance of men like your &s;elf, that would make us believe, that they know all and that under tho&s;e ob&s;cure and ambiguous words, are hid great my&s;teries, which they alone are capable to under&s;tand: If you had &s;ea&s;on'd me with that Philo|&s;ophy, which formeth the mind to ratiocination, and in&s;en&s;ibly accu|&s;toms it to be &s;atisfied with nothing but &s;olid rea&s;ons; if you had given me tho&s;e excellent precepts and do|ctrines, which rai&s;e the Soul above the a&s;&s;aults of Fortune, and reduce her to an un&s;hakeable and always e|qual temper, and permit her not to be lifted up by pro&s;perity, nor deba|&s;ed by adver&s;ity; if you had taken care to give me the knowledge of what we are, and what are the fir&s;t principles of things; and had a&s;&s;i&s;ted

me in forming in my mind a fit Idea of the greatne&s;s of the Univer&s;e, and of the admirable order and motion of the parts thereof; if, I &s;ay, you had in&s;tilled into me this kind of Philo&s;ophy, I &s;hould think my &s;elf incomparably more obliged to you than <HI>Alexander</HI> was to his <HI>Aristotle;</HI> and believe it my duty to recompence you otherwi&s;e, than he did him. Should not you, in&s;tead of your flattery, have taught me &s;omewhat of that point &s;o important to a King, which is, what the reciprocal duties are of a Soveraign to his Subjects, and tho&s;e of Subjects, to their Sove|raign?

<P>At that time there aro&s;e a kind of Tempe&s;t again&s;t <HI>A&s;trologers,</HI> which did not di&s;pleaie me. Mo&s;t people of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are &s;o infatuated by <HI>Judiciary A&s;tro|logy,</HI> that they believe there is nothing done here below, but 'tis written above (for &s;o they &s;peak.) In all their under|takings therefore they con&s;ult A&s;tro|logers. When two Armies are ready to give Battel, they beware of falling on, till the A&s;trologer hath taken and determined the moment he fancies pro|pitious for the beginning of the Com|bat. And &s;o, when the matter is about electing a Captain-General of an Army, of di&s;patching an Amba&s;|&s;ador, of concluding a Marriage, of beginning a Voyage, and of doing any other thing, as buying a Slave, putting on new Apparel, &amp;c. nothing of all that is done without the &s;entence of Mr. Star-Gazer; which is an in|credible vexation, and a cu&s;tom draw|ing after it &s;uch important con&s;equen|ces,

that I know not how it can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t &s;o long. For the A&s;trologer mu&s;t needs have knowledge of all that pa&s;&s;eth, and of all that is under|taken from the greate&s;t Affairs to the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>But behold, it happen'd, that the Prime A&s;trologer of the King was drown'd, which occa&s;ioned a great noi&s;e at Court, and was a great di&s;|credit to A&s;trology: For he being the per&s;on that determined the moments of all enterprizes and actions for the King, and the Omrahs, every one wondred, how a man &s;o experienced, and that for &s;o long time had di&s;pen&s;ed good adventures to others, could not fore&s;ee his own misfortune. There were not wanting tho&s;e, who pre|tended to be wi&s;er than others, and &s;aid, that in <HI>Frangi&s;tan,</HI> where Sci|ences did flouri&s;h, the Grandees do &s;u&s;pect all &s;uch kind of people, and that &s;ome hold them even no better than Mountebanks, that 'tis much doubted, whether this Knowledge is grounded upon good and &s;olid

rea&s;ons, and that it may very well be &s;ome fancy of A&s;trologers, or rather an artifice to make them&s;elves nece&s;&s;a|ry to the Great ones, and to make them in &s;ome mea&s;ure to depend on them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es very much di&s;|plea&s;ed the A&s;trologers; but nothing angred them &s;o much as this Story, be|come very famous, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Great <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> commanded to be digged and prepared a little place in his Seraglio to make a Garden; that the young Trees were all ready, and that the Gardner made account to plant them the next day. Mean time the A&s;trologer taking upon him, &s;aid, that a good nick of time was to be ob|&s;erved for planting them, to make them pro&s;per. <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> being con|tent it &s;hould be &s;o, the Star-gazer took his In&s;truments, turned over his Books, made his Calculation, and concluded, that by rea&s;on of &s;uch and &s;uch a Con|junction and A&s;pect of the Planets, it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be &s;et pre|&s;ently. The Ma&s;ter-Gardner, who
<PB N="64" REF="138">
minded nothing le&s;s than this A&s;trolo|ger, was not then at hand; yet for all that, they fell to work immediately, making holes, and planting the Trees, <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> him&s;elf &s;etting them, that it might be &s;aid, that they were Trees &s;et with <HI>Chah-Abas</HI>'s own hands. The Gardner returning at night, was &s;uffi|ciently amazed when he &s;aw the work done; and finding that the right place and order de&s;igned by him, was not taken; that, for example, an Apri|cock-tree &s;tood where an Apple-tree &s;hould &s;tand, and a Pear-tree where all Almond-tree; being heartily angry with the A&s;trologer, cau&s;ed all the Trees to be plucked up again&punc; and laid them down, with &s;ome Earth about them, for next morning, the time cho&s;en by him&s;elf. The news hereof came &s;oon to the Ears of the A&s;trolo|ger, who pre&s;ently told <HI>Chah-Abas</HI> of it: He forthwith &s;ent for the Gard|ner, and with &s;ome indignation asked him; What had made him &s;o bold as to pull up tho&s;e Young Trees he had planted with his own hand; that the

time had been &s;o exactly taken for them, that &s;o good an one would ne|ver be had again&punc; and that &s;o he had marred all. The rude Gardner, who had a Cup of <HI>Chiras</HI>-wine in his head, look'd a&s;ide upon the A&s;trologer, and grumbling and &s;wearing, &s;aid to him the&s;e words, <HI>Billah, Billah,</HI> that mu&s;t needs be an admirable point of time which thou ha&s;t taken for the&s;e Trees; unhappy A&s;trologer!

The&s;e Trunks, after his Death, were brought before <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> when he was in the A&s;&s;embly, and by his command in&s;tantly opened in the pre&s;ence of all the Omrahs, that &s;aw all this fine Stuff, which &s;o provo|and di&s;compo&s;ed <HI>Chah-Jehan,</HI> that

There were al&s;o certain <HI>Mul|lahs,</HI> that were permitted to come and to read the <HI>Alceran</HI> to him (for he was become very devout.)

And this was the effect of the obliging Let|ters, full of re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which he often wrote to his Father, con&s;ulting him often as his Oracle, and expre&s;&s;ing a thou&s;and cares for him; &s;ending him al&s;o unce&s;&s;antly &s;ome pretty Pre&s;ent or other; where|by <HI>Chah-Jehan</HI> was &s;o much gained, that he al&s;o wrote very often to <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> touching the Government and State-affairs, and of his own accord &s;ent him &s;ome of tho&s;e Jewels, which before he had told him of, that Hum|mers were ready to beat them to pow|der the fir&s;t time he &s;hould again ask for them. Be&s;ides, he con&s;ented that the Daughter of <HI>Dara,</HI> which he had &s;o peremptorily denied, &s;hould be de|liver'd to him; and granted him at length that pardon and paternal ble&s;|&s;ing which he had &s;o often de&s;ired

<P>Sir, You would have me indi&s;pen&s;ably follow tho&s;e ancient Cu&s;toms, and make my &s;elf Heir to all tho&s;e that are in my pay with the wonted rigour: An Omrah, and even a Merchant can no &s;ooner die, and &s;ometimes even before his death, but we &s;eal up his Trunks, and &s;eize on his goods, and make a &s;trict enquiry into his E&s;tate, impri&s;oning and ill-treating the Officers of the Hou&s;e to di&s;cover to us all he hath, even to the lea&s;t Jewels.

<P>But <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is too &s;harp-&s;ighted, not to pierce into the de&s;igns of <HI>Emir.</HI> He &s;eeth him triumphing over <HI>Sujah;</HI> he knows his great credit and reputa|tion, and that he hath the e&s;teem of a very wi&s;e, undertaking, valiant and rich man; and that the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale</HI> is not only the be&s;t of all <HI>Indo|&s;tan,</HI> but &s;trong of it &s;elf, and fur|ther, that this <HI>Emir</HI> is in the head of a well di&s;ciplin'd Army, which both ho|nours and fears him. Be&s;ides, he is not ignorant of his ambition, and fore|&s;eeth well enough, that if he &s;hould have with him his Son <HI>Mahmet-Emir|kan,</HI> he would a&s;pire to the Crown, and at lea&s;t take full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ben|gale,</HI> if he &s;hould not be able to ad|vance

vance things further.

He &s;ends to him his Wife and Daugh|ter, and all the Children of his Son: He maketh the <HI>Emir</HI> a <HI>Mir-Ul Omrah,</HI> which is in that Empire the greate&s;t degree of honour that a Favourite can be rai&s;ed to: And as to <HI>Mahmet-Emir-kan,</HI> he maketh him the <HI>Great Bakchis,</HI> which is a dignity and charge like that of our Great Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, the &s;econd or third Office in the State, but &s;uch an one as ab&s;olutely obligeth the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it to be alwayes at the Court, not &s;uffering him, but very difficultly, to be ab&s;ent from the per&s;on of the King.</P>
<P>The <HI>Emir</HI> &s;oon perceived, that <HI>Au|reng-Zebe</HI> had skilfully put by the &s;troke, that it would be in vain the &s;e|cond time to ask of him his Son; that
<PB N="77" REF="145">
he could not do it without offending him; and that therefore the &s;afe&s;t way would be to re&s;t contented with all the te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip, and with all the Honours, together with the Go|vernment of <HI>Bengale;</HI> being in the mean time alwayes upon his guard, and in &s;uch a po&s;ture, that &s;ince he could attempt nothing again&s;t <HI>Aureng-Zebe, Aureng-Zebe</HI> &s;hould not be able to attempt any thing again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thus have we &s;een the&s;e two Great Men carry them&s;elves to one another: And in this condition did affairs re|main for almo&s;t a year; till <HI>Aureng-Ze|be,</HI> too well knowing that a great Cap|tain cannot be long at re&s;t, and that, if he be not employed in a Forreign War, he will at length rai&s;e a Dome|&s;tick one; propo&s;ed to him to make War upon that rich and potent Raja of <HI>Acham,</HI> who&s;e Territories are on the North of <HI>Dake,</HI> upon the Gulf of <HI>Bengale.</HI> The <HI>Emir,</HI> who in all ap|pearance had already de&s;igned this &s;ame thing of him&s;elf, and who believed, that the Conque&s;t of this Countrey,
<PB N="78" REF="146">
would make way for his Immortal Ho|nour, and be an occa&s;ion of carrying his Arms as far as <HI>China,</HI> declared him|&s;elf ready for this Enterprize. He em|barked at <HI>Dake</HI> with a pui&s;&s;ant Army, upon a River which comes from tho&s;e parts; upon which having gone about an hundred Leagues North-Ea&s;tward, he arrived at a Ca&s;tle called <HI>Azo,</HI> which the Raja of <HI>Acham</HI> had u&s;urped from the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed for many years. He attacked this place, and took it by force in le&s;s than fifteen dayes; thence marching over Land towards <HI>Chamdara,</HI> which is the Inlet into the Countrey of that Raja; he entred into it after 26 dayes journey, &s;till Northward: There a Battel was fought, in which the Raja of <HI>Acham</HI> was wor&s;ted, and obliged to retreat to <HI>Guerguon,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of his King|dom, four miles di&s;tant from <HI>Chamda|ra.</HI> The <HI>Emir</HI> pur&s;ued him &s;o clo&s;e, that he gave him no time to fortifie him&s;elf in <HI>Guerguon:</HI> For he arrived in &s;ight of that Town in five dayes, which con|&s;trained the <HI>Raja,</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Emir</HI>'s

Army, to fly towards the Mountains of the Kingdom of <HI>La&s;&s;a,</HI> and to aban|don <HI>Guerguon,</HI> which was pillaged, as had been <HI>Chamdara.</HI> They found there va&s;t riches, it being a great, very fair and Merchant-like Town, and where the Women are extraordinarily beauti|ful. Mean time, the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains came in &s;ooner than u&s;ually; and they being exce&s;&s;ive in tho&s;e parts, and o|verflowing all the Countrey, except &s;uch Villages as &s;tand on rai&s;ed ground, the <HI>Emir</HI> was much embara&s;&s;ed. For the <HI>Raja</HI> made his people of the Moun|tains come down from all parts there|about, and to carry away all the provi|&s;ions of the Field; whereby the <HI>Emir</HI>'s Army (as rich as 'twas) before the end of the rains fell into great &s;treights, without being able to go forward or backward. It could not advance, by rea&s;on of the Mountains very difficult to pa&s;s, and continually pe&s;ter'd with great Rains; nor retreat, becau&s;e of the like Rains and deep wayes; the <HI>Raja</HI> al&s;o having cau&s;ed the way to be digged up as far as to <HI>Chamdara:</HI> So
<PB N="80" REF="147">
that the <HI>Emir</HI> was forced to remain in that wretched condition during the whole time of the Rain; after which, when he found his Army di&s;ta&s;ted, ti|red out, and half &s;tarved, he was ne|ce&s;&s;itated to give over the De&s;ign he had of advancing, and to return the &s;ame way he was come. But this Re|treat was made with &s;o much pains, and &s;o great inconveniencies, by rea|&s;on of the dirt, the want of victuals, and the pur&s;uit of the <HI>Raja</HI> falling on the Rear, that every body (but he) that had not known how to remedy the di&s;order of &s;uch a March, nor had the patience to be &s;ometimes five or &s;ix hours at one pa&s;&s;age to make the Soul|diery get over it withont confu&s;ion, would have utterly peri&s;h'd, him&s;elf, Army, and all; yet he, notwith&s;tand|ing all the&s;e difficulties and ob&s;tacles, made a &s;hift to come back with great honour and va&s;t riches.

Garri&s;on, would be able to hold out the re&s;t of the year again&s;t the <HI>Raja.</HI> But he was no &s;ooner arrived there, but Fluxes began to rage in his Army: Neither had him&s;elf a body of Steel more than the re&s;t; he fell &s;ick and died, whereby Fortune ended the ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> I &s;ay, the <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> apprehen&s;ions; for there was none of tho&s;e that knew this great man, and the &s;tate of the affairs of <HI>Indostan,</HI> who did not &s;ay, 'Tis this day that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> is King of <HI>Benga|le.</HI> And him&s;elf could not forbear to expre&s;s &s;ome &s;uch thing; for he pub|lickly &s;aid to <HI>Mahmet-Emir-kan;</HI> You have lo&s;t your Father, and I the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t dangerous Friend I had; yet notwith&s;tanding he comforted this Son, and withal a&s;&s;ured him, that he would ever be a Father to him. And whereas 'twas thought, that he would at lea&s;t cut off his Salary, and make Inqui&s;ition into his Trea|&s;ury, he confirmed him in his Of|fice of <HI>Bakehis,</HI> augmented his Pen&s;i|on to a thou&s;and Rupies a moneth,

and left him Heir of all the E&s;tate of his Father, although the Cu&s;tom of the Country empowred him to &s;eize on all.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> is concerning <HI>Chah-he&s;t-kan,</HI> whom <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> made fir&s;t Governour of <HI>Agra,</HI> when he went out to the Battel of <HI>Kadjoue</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sultan Sujah;</HI> and afterward, Gover|nour and General of the Army in <HI>De|can;</HI> and at la&s;t, after the death of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> Governour and General of the Army in <HI>Bengale&punc;</HI> together with the charge of <HI>Mirul&punc;Omrah</HI> which <HI>Emir-jemla</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

&s;uch as had de&s;erved the Rope, were mo&s;t welcome and mo&s;t e&s;teem'd there, leading in that Country a life that was very dete&s;table, and altoge|ther unworthy of Chri&s;tians, in&s;o|much that they impunely butchered and poy&s;oned one another, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated their own Prie&s;ts, who &s;ome|times were not better than them&s;elves. The King of <HI>Rakan</HI> in the apprehen&s;i|on he hath ever had of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> kept them for a guard of his Frontiers, in a Port-Town called <HI>Chategon,</HI> giving them Land, and liberty to live as they plea&s;ed.

It was the good fortune of <HI>Sultan Mazum,</HI> that he pro&s;per'd in this attempt, not lo&s;ing any more than two or three men, and &s;ome hor&s;es that were woun|ded, although, on the other hand, the matter went not off &s;o plea&s;antly, the wounded <HI>Lyon</HI> having leapt up to the head of the Sultan's Elephant.

<P>All this great Penin&s;ule of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> cutting it from the Bay of <HI>Cambaja</HI> un|to that of <HI>Bengale,</HI> near <HI>Jaganrate,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing thence to Cape <HI>Comori,</HI> was &s;earce two hundred years &s;ince entirely (&s;ome mountanous parts excepted) un|der the Dominion of one only Prince, who con&s;equently was a very great and very potent Monarch: But now it is divided among many different Sove|raigns, that are al&s;o of different Reli|gions.

The I&s;&s;ue of <HI>Ramras,</HI> not finding them&s;elves &s;trong enough for them, were content to keep them|&s;elves in a Corner, <HI>viz.</HI> in that Coun|trey which is commonly called <HI>Karna|tek,</HI> in our Maps, <HI>Bi&s;naguer,</HI> where they are &s;till <HI>Raja's</HI> to this very day.

The&s;e three Slaves and their po&s;terity have alwayes defended them&s;elves very well in their Kingdoms, whil&s;t they kept a good mutual corre&s;pondence, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted one another in their grie|vous wars again&s;t the <HI>Mogols.</HI> But when they once came to think every one to defend their Lands apart, they &s;oon found the effects of their divi&s;ion. For the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;o well knew to take his time upon that occa&s;ion (which is now a|bout thirty five or forty years &s;ince) that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf within a little time of all the Countrey of <HI>Nejam-Chah,</HI> or King <HI>Nejam,</HI> the fifth or &s;ixth of the family of the fir&s;t Slave, and at la&s;t took him pri&s;oner in <HI>Daulet-Abud,</HI> the Capital, where he died.</P>
<P>After that time, the Kings of <HI>Gol|konda</HI> have maintained them&s;elves well enough; not as if they could compare with the power of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> but be|cau&s;e the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath alwayes been em|ployed again&s;t the two others; from whom he was to take <HI>Amber, Paranda, Bider,</HI> and &s;ome other places, before he could conveniently march towards

<HI>Golkonda.</HI> And becau&s;e they have always been &s;o politick, being very opulent, as to furni&s;h under hand the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> with Money, and thereby to help him to maintain a War again&s;t the <HI>Mogol:</HI> Be&s;ides that, they ever have a con&s;iderable Army on foot, which is alwayes ready, and never fails to take the Field, and to ap|proach to the Frontiers, at the time when there is news that that of the <HI>Mogol</HI> marches again&s;t <HI>Vi&s;apour;</HI> to let the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;ee, not only that they are alwayes ready to defend them&s;elves, but al&s;o that they could ea&s;ily a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> in ca&s;e he &s;hould be reduced to any extremity. Next, which is very con&s;iderable, they know al&s;o how to convey Money un|der hand to the Chieftains of the <HI>Mo|golian</HI> Army; who thereupon advi&s;e the Court, that it is more to purpo&s;e to attack <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> as being nearer to <HI>Daulet-Abad.</HI> Further, they &s;end eve|ry year very con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents to the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> by way of Tribute; which con&s;i&s;t partly in &s;ome rare ma|nufactures

La&s;tly, the <HI>Mogol</HI> con|&s;iders that Kingdom as his own, not only becau&s;e he looks upon the King thereof as his Tributary, but chiefly &s;ince that agrement heretofore &s;poken of, which the pre&s;ent King made with <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> when he be&s;ieged <HI>Golkon|da;</HI> and there being al&s;o no place able to re&s;i&s;t, even from <HI>Daulet-Abad</HI> unto <HI>Golkonda,</HI> he judgeth, that when he &s;hall think fit to pu&s;h for it, he may take in the whole Kingdom in one Campagne; which in my opinion, he would certainly have done, if he did not apprehend, le&s;t &s;ending his Forces towards <HI>Golkonda,</HI> the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> &s;hould enter into <HI>Decan;</HI> as, no doubt, he would do, knowing it to be very important to his con&s;ervation, that that Kingdom may alwayes &s;ub&s;i&s;t as now it is.</P>

with the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and what way he taketh to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t him. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, I find this &s;tate much &s;haken, in regard that the King that now is, &s;ince that unhap|py affair of <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> and <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> &s;eems to have lo&s;t heart, and as 'twere abandoned the reins of the Kingdom, not daring any more to go forth of this Fortre&s;s of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> nor &s;o much as appear in publick to give Audience to his People, and to ren|der Ju&s;tice according to the cu&s;tom of the Country: Which di&s;compo&s;eth things very much, and occa&s;ions the Grandees to tyrannize over the mea|ner &s;ort of People, and to lo&s;e even their re&s;pect to the King, often &s;lighting his Commands, and con&s;idering him no more than a Woman; and the People, weary of the inju&s;tice and ill treatment, breathing after nothing but <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> 'Tis ea&s;ie to judge of the &s;treights this poor King is in, by four or five particulars I am about to relate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, that <HI>An.</HI> 1667. when I was
<PB N="116" REF="166">
at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> King <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> ha|ving &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordi|nary to declare War to that King, un|le&s;s he would furni&s;h him with 10000 Hor&s;e again&s;t <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> he did extra|ordinary honour, and give exce&s;&s;ive pre&s;ents to that Amba&s;&s;ador, as well for him in particular, as for <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and made an agreement with him, to &s;end him, not 10000 Hor&s;e, but as much Money as is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain &s;o many; which was all that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> looked for.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is, that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador in Ordinary, that is con|&s;tantly at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> commands, threa|tens, &s;triketh, gives Pa&s;s-ports, and &s;aith and doth what&s;oever he will, no man daring with the lea&s;t word to cro&s;s him.</P>
<P>The third is, that <HI>Mahmet-Emir-kan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Emir-Jemla,</HI> though he be no more than a &s;imple Omrah of <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> is yet &s;o much re&s;pected through that whole Kingdom, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Ma&s;lipa|tan,</HI> that the <HI>Taptata,</HI> his Commi&s;&s;i|oner,
<PB N="117" REF="166">
is as 'twere Ma&s;ter thereof, buying and &s;elling, bringing in and &s;ending abroad his Merchants Ships, no body daring to contradict him in any thing, not to demand any Cu|&s;toms. So great was once the power of <HI>Emir-Jemla</HI> his Father in this King|dom, which time hath not yet been able to root out.</P>
<P>The fourth is, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;cruple not to threaten him &s;ometimes, to lay an Embargo upon all the Mer|chants Ships of the Country that are in that Port, and not to let them go out, untill their demands be granted; as al&s;o to put in prote&s;tations again&s;t him: which I have &s;een actually done, upon the account of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which they had a mind to take by force in the Port of <HI>Ma&s;lipatan</HI> it &s;elf, the Governour having hindred it, by ar|ming the whole Town again&s;t them, and threatning to put fire to their Factory, and to put them all to death.</P>
<P>A fifth is, that the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> as poor, and mi&s;erable, and decayed as
<PB N="118" REF="167">
they are in the <HI>Indies,</HI> yet &s;tick not to threaten that King al&s;o with War; and that they will come and &s;ack <HI>Ma&s;lipatan,</HI> and all that Coa&s;t, if he will not render them that place of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which &s;ome years ago they cho&s;e to put into his hands, rather than to be con&s;trained to yield it up to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Yet for all this, I have been inform|ed in <HI>Golkonda,</HI> by very intelligent per|&s;ons, that this King is a Prince of very great judgment, and that whatever he &s;o does and &s;uffers, is only in policy, to the end to provoke no body, and principally to remove all &s;u&s;pition from <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> and to give him to under&s;tand, that he hath in a manner no &s;hare any more in the Kingdom: But that in the mean time a Son of his, that is kept hid, grows up, the Father watching for a fit time to declare him King, and &s;o to laugh at the agreement made with <HI>Aureng-Zebe.</HI> Of this, time will &s;hew us more; in the mean time, let us con&s;ider &s;omewhat of the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Vi&s;apour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="167">
The Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> hath al&s;o not been wanting to &s;upport it &s;elf, though the <HI>Mogol</HI> do almo&s;t continual|ly make war again&s;t it; not &s;o much as if he of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> were able to bid head to the <HI>Mogolian</HI> Forces, but be|cau&s;e there is never any great effort u|&s;ed again&s;t him. For it is not very frequent there, no more than 'tis el&s;e|where, for Generals of Armies to de|&s;ire the end of a War; there being no|thing &s;o charming, as to be in the head of an Army, commanding like little Kings, remote from the Court. It is al&s;o grown to a Proverb, that <HI>De|can</HI> is the Bread and Life of the Souldi|ers of <HI>Indo&s;tan.</HI> Be&s;ides, the Coun|trey of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> is on the &s;ide of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Dominions of a very difficult acce&s;s, upon the account of the &s;earci|ty of good Waters, Forrage, and Vi|ctuals; and becau&s;e <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> the Ca|pital City, is very &s;trong, and &s;ituate in a dry and &s;teril Countrey, there be|ing almo&s;t no good Water but in the Town.

<PB N="120" REF="168">
&s;eated on Hills hard to climb.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, that State is much &s;haken, if con&s;idering that the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath taken <HI>Paranda,</HI> the Key, as 'twere, of that Kingdom; as al&s;o that fair and &s;trong Town <HI>Bider,</HI> and &s;ome other very important places: But principally becau&s;e the la&s;t King of <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> died without Heirs Males, and he that now calls him&s;elf King, is a Youth, whom the Queen, Si&s;ter of the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> hath rai&s;ed, and taken for her Son (a favour for which he hath made an ill return, having &s;hew'd no e&s;teem for this Queen after her return from <HI>Mecca,</HI> under the pre|text of &s;ome ill demeanour in her on a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that carried her to <HI>Mo|ka:)</HI> La&s;tly, becau&s;e that in the di&s;or|ders of that Kingdom, the Heathen Rebel, <HI>Seva-Gi,</HI> above di&s;cour&s;ed of, found means to &s;eize on many &s;trong Holds, mo&s;tly &s;eated on &s;teep Moun|tains, where he now acteth the King, laughing at the <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> and the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and ravaging the Countrey every where, from <HI>Suratte</HI> even to the gates
<PB N="121" REF="168">
of <HI>Goa.</HI> This notwith&s;tanding, if he wrongs <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> one way, he helps to &s;upport it another, fora&s;much as he is re&s;olutely bent again&s;t the <HI>Mogol,</HI> pre|paring alwayes &s;ome Ambu&s;h, and cut|ting &s;o much work for his Army, that there is no di&s;cour&s;e, no apprehen&s;ion but of <HI>Seva-Gi;</HI> in&s;omuch that he hath come and &s;acked <HI>Suratte,</HI> and pillaged the I&s;le of <HI>Burdes,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and is near the Gates of <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;eventh</HI> particular, which I learn'd at <HI>Golkonda,</HI> when I was come away from <HI>Dehli,</HI> is the death of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> and that <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> had been exceedingly affected therewith, having di&s;cover'd all the marks of grief, that a Son can expre&s;s for the lo&s;s of his Fa|ther: That at the very hour of recei|ving that news, he went towards <HI>A|gra;</HI> that <HI>Begum-Saheb</HI> cau&s;ed the Mo&s;|quee, and a certain place, where he was at fir&s;t to &s;top, before he entred the Fortre&s;s, to be hung with richly embroider'd Tapi&s;&s;eries: That at his entring into the Seraglio, &s;he pre&s;ented
<PB N="122" REF="169">
him with a great Golden Ba&s;on, where|in were all her Jewels, and all tho&s;e of <HI>Chah-Jehan;</HI> and in &s;hort, that &s;he knew to receive him with &s;o much Magnificence, and to entertain him with that dexterity and craft, that &s;he obtained his pardon, gain'd his favour, and grew very confident with him.</P>
<P>To conclude, I doubt not, but mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who &s;hall have read my Hi|&s;tory, will judge the wayes taken by <HI>Aureng-Zebe,</HI> for getting the Empire, very violent and horrid. I pretend not at all to plead for him, but de&s;ire only, that before he be altogether condemn|ed, reflexion be made on that unhap|py cu&s;tom of this State, which lea|ving the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown un|decided, for want of good Laws, &s;et|ling it, as among&s;t us, upon the elde&s;t Son, expo&s;eth it to the Con que&s;t of the &s;tronge&s;t, and the mo&s;t fortunate, &s;ub|jecting at the &s;ame time all the Princes born in the Royal Family, by the con|dition of their Birth, to the cruel ne|ce&s;&s;ity either to overcome, or to reign, by de&s;troying all the re&s;t, for the a&s;&s;u|rance
<PB N="123" REF="169">
of their power and life, or to pe|ri&s;h them&s;elves, for the &s;ecurity of that of others: For I am apt to believe, that upon this con&s;ideration the Rea|der wil not find <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI>'s conduct &s;o &s;trange as at fir&s;t it appear'd. Howe|ver I am per&s;waded, that tho&s;e who &s;hall a little weigh this whole Hi&s;tory, will not take <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> for a Barba|rian, but for a great and rare Genius, a Great States-man, and a Great King.</P>

<P>In a word, you may take notice, that this <HI>Great Mogol</HI> makes him&s;elf heir of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords, and of

the <HI>Man&s;eb-dars,</HI> or petty Lords, that are in his Pay; and (which is of very great con&s;equence) that all the Lands of that Expire are his propriety, excepting &s;ome Hou&s;es and Gardens, which he giveth leave to his Subjects to &s;ell, divide, or buy among&s;t them, as they &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the things, which &s;uf|ficiently &s;how, <HI>both</HI> that there mu&s;t needs be a very great &s;tore of Gold and Silver in <HI>Indostan,</HI> though there be no Mines; <HI>and</HI> al&s;o that the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> the Soveraign of the &s;ame, at lea&s;t, of the be&s;t part of it, hath immen&s;e Revenues and Riches.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, there are al&s;o many things to be ob&s;erved, which are a poi&s;e to the&s;e Riches. The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that among tho&s;e va&s;t tracts of Land there is much, which is nothing but &s;and and &s;terill Mountains, little Til|led or Peopled: That even of tho&s;e that would be fertile, there is much, that is not u&s;ed for want of Workmen, &s;ome of which have peri&s;h'd by the too evil treatment of the Governours,

<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is, That in this &s;ame extent of Country there are &s;undry Nations, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> is not full Ma&s;ter of, mo&s;t of them retaining yet their particular Sovereigns and Lords, that obey him not, nor pay him tribute but from con&s;traint; ma|ny, that do little; &s;ome that do no|thing at all; and &s;ome al&s;o, that re|ceive tribute from him, as we &s;hall &s;ee anon.

Such are al&s;o the <HI>Patans,</HI> a <HI>Mahumetan</HI> People, i&s;&s;ued from the &s;ide of the River <HI>Ganges</HI> towards <HI>Ben|gale;</HI> who before the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Mogols</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> had taken their time to make them&s;elves potent in many places, and chiefly at <HI>Dehli,</HI> and to render many <HI>Rajas</HI> thereabout their Tributaries.

high &s;pirit, being often heard to &s;ay by way of &s;wearing; <HI>Let me never be King of</HI> Dehli, <HI>if it be not &s;o:</HI> A Peo|ple that de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>Indians, Heathen,</HI> and <HI>Mogols,</HI> and mortally hate the la&s;t, &s;till remembring what they were for|merly, before they were by them dri|ven away from their large Principa|lities, and con&s;trained to retire hither and thither, far from <HI>Dehli,</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> into the Mountains, where now they are &s;etled, and where &s;ome of them have made them&s;elves petty Sove|reigns, like <HI>Rajas,</HI> but of &s;mall &s;trength.</P>
<P>Such an one al&s;o is the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> who pays to the <HI>Magol</HI> no|thing, and is always in War with him; maintaining him&s;elf in his Country, partly by his own forces, partly becau&s;e he is very remote from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli,</HI> the ordinary places of Re&s;idence of the Great <HI>Mogol;</HI> partly al&s;o becau&s;e his Capital City <HI>Vi&s;apour</HI> is &s;trong and of difficult acce&s;s to an Army, by rea&s;on of the ill Waters and the want of Forrage on the way;
<PB N="137" REF="176">
and partly becau&s;e many <HI>Rajas</HI> joyn with him for their common defence, as did the famous <HI>Seva-gi,</HI> who not long &s;ince came pillaging and burning that rich Sea-port, <HI>Suratte,</HI> and who &s;ometimes will pay little or no Tri|bute.</P>
<P>Such is likwi&s;e that potent and rich King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> who under-hand gives Money to the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and hath always an Army ready on the Frontiers for his own defence, and for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> in ca&s;e he find him too much pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Of the like &s;ort are more than an hundred <HI>Rajas,</HI> or con&s;iderable <HI>Hea|then</HI> Sovereigns, di&s;per&s;ed through the whole Empire, &s;ome near to, o|thers remote from <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dehli:</HI> among&s;t whom there are about fifteen or &s;ixteen that are very rich and pui&s;|&s;ant; &s;uch as is <HI>Rana</HI> (who formerly was, as 'twere, Emperour of the <HI>Ra|jas;</HI> and who is &s;aid to be of the Pro|geny of King <HI>Porus;) Je&s;&s;eignae</HI> and <HI>Je&s;&s;om &s;eignae,</HI> which are &s;o great and powerful, that if they three alone
<PB N="136" REF="177">
&s;hould combine, they would hold him tack; each of them being able, in a very &s;hort time to rai&s;e and bring into the Field Twenty five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, better Troops than the <HI>Mogols.</HI> The&s;e Caveliers are called <HI>Ragipouts,</HI> or the Children of <HI>Rajas.</HI> They are men, who, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;aid, carry Swords from Father to Son, and to whom the <HI>Rajas</HI> allot Land, on condi|tion to be always ready to appear on Hor&s;eback, when the <HI>Raja</HI> commands. They can endure much hard&s;hip, and they want nothing to make them good Souldiers, but good Order and Di&s;|cipline.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> thing to be noted is, that the <HI>Mogol</HI> is a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> not of the Sect called <HI>Chias,</HI> who follow <HI>Aly</HI> and his off-&s;pring, (&s;uch as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t part of his Court;) but of that, which follows <HI>O&s;man,</HI> and thence are called <HI>O&s;manlys,</HI> &s;uch as the <HI>Turks</HI> are. Be&s;ides, that he is a &s;tran|ger, being of the Race of <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> who was the head of tho&s;e <HI>Mogols,</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="177">
that about the year 1401, over-ran <HI>India;</HI> where they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters: &s;o that he is in a Country, almo&s;t all ho&s;tile; and that the more, becau&s;e not only for one <HI>Mogol,</HI> but in general, for one <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> there are hundreds of <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Heathen;</HI> which obligeth him, con&s;tantly to entertain (for his defence among &s;o many Dome&s;tick and Potent Enemies, and again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Usbecks,</HI> his Neighbours) very great Armies, whether in time of Peace or War, as well about his Per&s;on as in the Field; as well of the People of the Countrey, <HI>(Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,)</HI> as chiefly <HI>Mogoli|ans,</HI> or at lea&s;t e&s;teemed &s;uch becau&s;e they are White, and <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> which &s;ufficeth at pre&s;ent; his Court being no more now as 'twas at fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting altogether of true <HI>Mogols;</HI> but a mixture of all &s;orts of &s;trangers, <HI>Usbecks, Per&s;ians, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> or their Children; but with this di&s;tinction, that the Children of the third or fourth generation, and that have taken the Brown colour,
<PB N="140" REF="178">
and the &s;oft humour of the Countrey, are not &s;o much e&s;teem'd as the new comers; being al&s;o &s;eldom rai&s;ed to publick Offices; but counting them|&s;elves happy, if they may &s;erve as &s;imple Hor&s;emen or Foot.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Armies I am now going to give you &s;ome de&s;cription, that thereby knowing the great expences, which the Grand <HI>Mogol</HI> is obliged to be at, you may the better judge of his true Riches; let us fir&s;t take a view of the Field Militia, he is nece&s;&s;ita|ted to maintain.</P>
<P>The chief thereof are the <HI>Rajas,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Je&s;&s;eignae, Je&s;&s;om&s;eignae,</HI> and many others, to whom he allows very great pen&s;ions to have them al|ways ready with a certain number of <HI>Ragipouts,</HI> e&s;teeming them like <HI>Om|rahs,</HI> that is, like other Strangers, and <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Lords; both in the Army, that is always about his per&s;on, and in tho&s;e al&s;o, that are in the Field. The&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> are generally obliged to the &s;ame things, that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are, even to the point of keeping guard;
<PB N="141" REF="178">
yet with this di&s;tinction, that they keep not the guard within the Fortre&s;s, as tho&s;e, but without, under their Tents; they not liking to be &s;hut up twenty four hours in a Fortre&s;s, nor &s;o much as ever to go thither but well attended with Men re&s;olute to be cut in pieces for their &s;ervice; as hath appeared, when they have been ill dealt withal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is obliged to keep the&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> in his &s;ervice for &s;undry rea&s;ons. The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e the Militia of the <HI>Rajas</HI> is very good (as was &s;aid above,) and becau&s;e there are <HI>Rajas,</HI> (as was intimated al&s;o) one of whom can bring into the Field above 25000 men. The <HI>Second,</HI> the better to bridle the other <HI>Rajas,</HI> and to reduce them to rea|&s;on, when they cantonize, or when they refu&s;e to pay tribute, or when out of fear or other cau&s;e they will not go out of their Country to the Army, when the <HI>Mogol</HI> requireth it. The <HI>third,</HI> the better to nouri&s;h jealou|&s;ies and keenne&s;s among&s;t them, by Favouring and Care&s;&s;ing the one
<PB N="142" REF="179">
more than the other, which is done to that degree, that they proceed to fight with one another very frequently.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth,</HI> to employ them again&s;t the <HI>Patans,</HI> or again&s;t his own <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Governours, in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth,</HI> to employ them again&s;t the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> when he refu|&s;eth to pay his tribute, or when he will defend the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> or &s;ome <HI>Rajas</HI> his neighbours, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath a mind of rifle, or to make his tributaries; the <HI>Mogol</HI> in the tho&s;e ca&s;es not daring to tru&s;t his <HI>Omrahs</HI> overmuch, who mo&s;t are <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and not of the &s;ame Religion with him, but <HI>Chias,</HI> like the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Golkonda.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ixth,</HI> and the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble of all, is, to employ them again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> upon occa&s;ion; not daring then al&s;o to confide in his <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who for the greate&s;t part, as was ju&s;t now &s;aid, are <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and con&s;equent|ly have no &s;tomach to Fight again&s;t their natural King; and the le&s;s, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="179">
they believe him to be their <HI>Imam,</HI> their <HI>Caliph</HI> or high Prie&s;t, de&s;cended from <HI>Aly,</HI> and again&s;t whom therefore they believe they cannot make War without a crime or a great &s;in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is farther obliged to en|tertain &s;ome <HI>Patans</HI> for the &s;ame, or &s;omewhat like rea&s;ons, that he doth the <HI>Rajas.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t he mu&s;t entertain that &s;tran|ger Militia of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> that we have taken notice of: And as this is the main &s;trength of his State, and which obliges him to incredible char|ges, me thinks it will not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe to you, of what nature it is, though I &s;hould be &s;omewhat long in doing it.</P>
<P>Let us therefore con&s;ider, if you plea&s;e, this &s;tranger Militia, both Cavalry and Infantry, as divided into two; the <HI>one</HI> being always near the <HI>Mo|gol</HI>'s Per&s;on; the <HI>other,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed up and down in the &s;everal Provinces. And in the Cavalry that is about his Per&s;on, let us fir&s;t take notice of the <HI>Omrahs;</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="180">
then, of the <HI>Man&s;ebdars;</HI> next, of the <HI>Rou&s;indars;</HI> la&s;t of all, of the &s;imple Hor&s;emen.

<P>It is not to be thought, that the <HI>Om|rahs</HI> or Lords of the <HI>Mogol's</HI> Court are Sons of great Families, as in <HI>France;</HI> All the Lands of that Empire being the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s propriety, it follows, that there are neither Dutchies, nor Marqui&s;ats, nor any Family Rich in Land, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting of its own income and patri|mony. And often enough they are not &s;o much as <HI>Omrahs</HI> Sons, becau&s;e the King being Heir of all their E&s;tates, it is con&s;equent that the Hou|&s;es cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in their great|ne&s;s; on the contrary, they often fall and that on a &s;udden, in&s;omuch that the Sons, or at lea&s;t the Grand&s;ons of a Potent <HI>Omrah</HI> are frequently, af|ter the death of their Father, redu|ced in a manner to Beggery, and
<PB N="145" REF="180">
obliged to li&s;t them&s;elves under &s;ome <HI>Omrah</HI> for &s;imple Hor&s;emen. 'Tis true, that ordinarily the <HI>Mogol</HI> leaves &s;ome &s;mall pen&s;ion to the Widow, and often al&s;o to the Children; or, if the Father liveth too long, he may by particular favour advance them &s;ooner, e&s;pecially if they be proper men, white of Face, having as yet not too much of the <HI>Indian</HI> Complexion and temper, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing yet for true <HI>Mogols:</HI> Though this advancement by favour do always proceed in a &s;low pace; it being almo&s;t a general cu&s;tom, that a man mu&s;t pa&s;s from &s;mall Pays and &s;mall Places to great ones. The&s;e <HI>Om|rahs</HI> then are commonly but Adven|turers and Strangers of all &s;orts of Na|tions, &s;uch as I have &s;aid; which draw one another to this Court; men of a mean de&s;cent, &s;ome of them &s;laves; mo&s;t of them without in&s;truction, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> thus rai&s;eth to dig|nities as he thinks good, and degrades them again, as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;ome are <HI>Hazary,</HI> others <HI>Dou Hazary,</HI> others
<PB N="146" REF="181">
<HI>Penge, Hecht,</HI> and <HI>Deh Hazary,</HI> and even (&s;uch as was the the Kings elde&s;t Son) <HI>Dovazdeh Hazary,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Lord of a thou&s;and Hor&s;e, of two thou&s;and, five thou&s;and, &s;even, ten, and tweive thou&s;and; their pay being le&s;s or more in proportion to the number of Hor&s;es; I &s;ay, of Hor&s;es, becau&s;e they are not paid in re&s;pect of the Hor&s;emen, but of the Hor&s;e; the <HI>Om|rahs</HI> having power to entertain Hor&s;e|men of two Hor&s;es a man, to be the better able to &s;erve in the hot Coun|trys, where 'tis a common &s;aying, that the Hor&s;eman that hath but one Hor&s;e, is more than half a Footman. Yet we mu&s;t not think, that they are obliged to entertain, or that the King effective|ly pays &s;o many Hor&s;e, as the&s;e great names of <HI>Dovazdeh</HI> or <HI>Hecht Ha|zary</HI> do impart, that is, 12000 or 8000 Hor&s;e. The&s;e are &s;pecious Names, to amu&s;e and attract Strangers; the King determines the number of Hor|&s;es in actual &s;ervice, which they are bound to entertain, pays them ac|cording to this number; and be&s;ides
<PB N="147" REF="181">
that, he payes them a certain number which they are not bound to entertain; and this is that which ordinarily makes the principal part of their pen&s;ions; not to &s;peak of what they finger out of the pay of every Hor&s;eman, and of the number of the Hor&s;es; which cer|tainly amounts to very con&s;iderable Pen&s;ions; e&s;pecially if they can ob|tain good <HI>Jah-ghirs,</HI> that is, good Lands for their Pen&s;ion. For I &s;aw, that the Lord, under whom I was, that was a <HI>Penge-hazary,</HI> or one of five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and who was only obliged to entertain five hundred in ef|fect, had, after all his Cavalry was paid, remaining for his Pen&s;ion near five thou&s;and Crowns a Month; though he was <HI>Nagdy,</HI> that is, paid in Money drawn out of the Trea&s;ury, as all tho&s;e are, that have not Lands. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e great Pen&s;ions, I &s;ee none but very few that are rich, but many that are unea&s;ie and indebted: Not that they are ruined by keeping too plentiful Tables, as el&s;ewhere great Lords frequently are;

<P>The number of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> as well of tho&s;e, that are in the Field in the Provinces and Armies, as of tho&s;e that are at the Court, is very great.

The&s;e are the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that arrive to the Go|vernments and principal Offices of the Court and Armies; that are, as they &s;peak, the Pillars of the Empire, and that keep up the &s;plendor of the Court; never going abroad, but richly deck'd,

<P>The&s;e acknowledge al&s;o none for their Head but the King, and they are generally obliged to whatever we have &s;aid the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are. In a word, they would be true <HI>Omrahs,</HI> if they had, as divers heretofore have had, &s;ome Hor&s;emen under them; whereas they have ordinarily but two, four, or &s;ix Hor&s;es having the Kings mark, and their pay goes no higher than from 200, to 600 or 700 <HI>Roupies</HI> a Month. Their number al&s;o is not fixed, but much exceeds that of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> there being of them at the Court al|ways two or three hundred, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are in the Provinces and Armies.</P>

which yet &s;ometimes is greater than that of many <HI>Man&s;ebdars,</HI> but not &s;o ho|nourable; but then they are not bound, as the <HI>Man&s;ebdars,</HI> to take at a &s;et price (which &s;ometies is not too rea&s;onable) of tho&s;e Tapi&s;&s;eries and other Hou&s;e|hold-&s;tuff, that hath &s;erved for the Kings Pallace. Their number is very great; they enter into the meaner Offices, many of them being Clerks, under-Clerks, Signet-men, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Simple Cavaliers,</HI> are tho&s;e, that are under the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> among&s;t whom the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and having mo&s;t Pay are tho&s;e, that have two Hor&s;es marked on the Leg with the mark of their <HI>Omrah.</HI> Their Pay is not ab&s;o|lutely fixed, but depends chiefly from the genero&s;ity of the <HI>Omrah,</HI> who may favour whom he plea&s;eth. Yet the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s intention is, that the Pay of a &s;imple Cavalier or Hor&s;eman be no le&s;s than twenty five <HI>Roupies</HI> or thereabout a Month, &s;tating his ac|cound with the <HI>Omrahs</HI> upon that Foot.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="184">
The pay of the Foot is the lea&s;t; and their Mu&s;quetiers are pitiful men, unle&s;s they di&s;charge when their Mus|ket leans on that &s;mall woodden fork hanging to it; yet even then they are afraid of &s;ingeing their great Beards, and of burning their Eyes, but mo&s;t of all, lea&s;t &s;ome <HI>Dgen</HI> or evil &s;pirit bur&s;t their Musket. Some of the&s;e have 20 <HI>Roupies</HI> a Month, &s;ome 15, &s;ome 10. But yet there are &s;ome Gunners, that have great Pay, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the <HI>Franguis</HI> or <HI>Christi|ans,</HI> as <HI>Portugue&s;es, Engli&s;h, Dutch, Germans, French,</HI> that retire thither from <HI>Goa,</HI> flying from <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Companies. Heretofore when the <HI>Mogols</HI> did not yet know how to ma|nage Artillery, their Pay was very great. And there are yet &s;ome of that time, who have 200 <HI>Roupies</HI> a Month; but now they will recieve none for more than thirty two.</P>
<P>Their Artillery is of two &s;orts; the one is the great and heavy Artillery; the other the light. As for the for|mer,
<PB N="154" REF="185">
I remember, that when the King after his Sickne&s;s went with his whole Army abroad into the Country, diverting him&s;elf every day in Hun|ting, &s;ometimes of Cranes, &s;ome|times of the gray Oxen (a kind of Elks) &s;ometimes of Gazels, Leo|pards and Lions, and making his pro|gre&s;s towards <HI>Lahor</HI> and <HI>Kachemire</HI> (that little paradi&s;e of <HI>India)</HI> there to pa&s;s the Summer, the Army had &s;eventy pieces of Cannon, mo&s;t of them ca&s;t, not counting the two&punc; or three hundred Camels, carrying each a &s;mall Field-piece of the bigne&s;s of a good double Musket, fa&s;tned to tho&s;e Animals. The other light Artillery is very brave and well order'd, con&s;i|&s;ting of fifty or &s;ixty &s;mall Field-pieces all of Bra&s;s, each mounted on a little Chariot, very fine and well painted, with a &s;mall Coffer before and behind for the Powder, drawn by two very fair Hor&s;es, driven by a Coachman like a <HI>Caleche,</HI> adorned with a number of &s;mall red Streamers, each having a third Hor&s;e, led by the Chariot for relief.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="185">
The great Artillery could not al|wayes follow the King, who often left the High-way, and turn'd &s;ometimes to the right, &s;ometimes to the left hand, cro&s;&s;ing the fields, to find the true pla|ces for Game, and to follow the cour&s;e of the Rivers. <HI>That</HI> therefore was to keep the High way to go the more ea|&s;ily, and to avoid the embara&s;ments, which it would have met with in the ill pa&s;&s;ages, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Boat-Bridges made to pa&s;s Rivers. The light Artillery is in&s;eparable from the per&s;on of the King, it marcheth away in the morning, when the King comes out of his Tent, and whereas he common|ly goes a little a&s;ide into the places for game, this Artillery pa&s;&s;eth on &s;traight with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, to be in time at the Rendez-vous, and there to ap|pear before the Kings Tent, which is there made ready the day before; as are al&s;o the Tents of the great <HI>Omrahs:</HI> And this whole Artillery giveth a vol|ley ju&s;t when the Kihg enters into his Tent, thereby to give notice to the Army of his arrival.</P>

The Militia of the Field is not dif|ferent from that which is about the King: There are every where <HI>Omrahs, Man&s;ebdars, Rou&s;indars,</HI> &s;imple Hor&s;e|men, and Foot and Artillery where|ever any War is made. The difference is only in the number, which is much greater in the Field-Army, than in the other. For that Army alone, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> is con&s;trained perpetually to maintain in <HI>Decan,</HI> to bridle the potent King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> and to make War upon the King of <HI>Vi&s;apour,</HI> and upon all the <HI>Raja's</HI> that joyn with him, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t at lea&s;t of twenty or twenty five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, &s;ometimes of thirty.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Kaboul,</HI> for its or|dinary Guard again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians, Au|gans, Balouches,</HI> and I know not how many Mounteniers, requireth at lea&s;t fifteen thou&s;and. The Kingdom of <HI>Kachmire,</HI> more than four thou&s;and; and the Kingdom of <HI>Bengale,</HI> much more; not counting tho&s;e that are em|ployed in the War, which mu&s;t al|mo&s;t alwayes be maintained on that

&s;ide; nor tho&s;e which the Governors of the &s;everal Provinces do need for their defence, according to the parti|cular extent and &s;ituation of their Go|vernments; which maketh an incre|dible number.</P>
<P>Not to mention the Infantry (which is incon&s;iderable) I am apt to believe with many others, well informed of the&s;e matters, that the number of the Hor&s;e in actual &s;ervice about the Kings per&s;on, comprehending the Cavalry of the <HI>Raja's</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> mounteth to thir|ty five or forty thou&s;and; and that this number, joyned to tho&s;e that is abroad in the Field, may make two hundred thou&s;and, and better.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, that the Infantry is incon&s;ide|rable; for I can hardly believe, that in the Army which is about the King, compri&s;ing the Mu&s;quetiers, and all the Gunners and their Mates, and whatever &s;erves in this Artillery, can amount to much more than fifteen thou&s;and; whence you may make a near gue&s;s, what the number of the Foot mu&s;t be in the Field. So
<PB N="158" REF="187">
that I know not whence to take that prodigious number of Foot, which &s;ome do reckon in the Armies of the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> unle&s;s it be, that with this true Souldiery they confound all the Serving-men and Vi|ctualers, that follow the Army; for in that &s;ence I &s;hould ea&s;ily believe, that they had rea&s;on to reckon two or three hundred thou&s;and men in that Army alone which is with the King, and &s;ometimes more; e&s;pecially when 'tis certain, that he is to be long ab|&s;ent from the Capital City: which will not &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to him, that con&s;iders the multitude and confu&s;ion of Tents, Kitchens, Baggage, Wo|men, Elephants, Camels, Oxen, Hor&s;es, Waiting-men, Porters, Forra|gers, Victualers, Merchants of all &s;orts, that mu&s;t follow the Army; nor to him, that knows the State and parti|cular Government of that Countrey, wherein the King is the &s;ole proprietor of all the Lands of the Kingdom; whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that a whole Metropolitan City, &s;uch as <HI>Deh|ly</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="187">
and <HI>Agra,</HI> liveth of almo&s;t nothing but of the Souldiery, and is con&s;equent|ly obliged to follow the King when he taketh the Field; tho&s;e Towns being nothing le&s;s than <HI>Paris,</HI> but indeed no otherwi&s;e governed than a Camp of Armies a little better and more conve|niently lodged than in the open Field.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e things, you may al&s;o con&s;ider, if you plea&s;e, that gene|rally all this Militia, which I have been repre&s;enting to you, from the greate&s;t <HI>Omrah,</HI> to the meane&s;t Souldi|er, is indi&s;pen&s;ably paid every two months; the Kings pay being its &s;ole refuge and relief; nor can its pay be de|ferred there, as 'tis &s;ometimes with us&punc; where, when there are pre&s;&s;ing occa|&s;ions of the State, a Gentleman, an Officer, and even a &s;imple Cavalier, can &s;tay a while, and maintain him&s;elf of his own Stock, Rents and the In|comes of his Land. But in the <HI>Mo|gol</HI>'s Countrey, all mu&s;t be paid at the time prefix'd, or all disbands and &s;tarves, after they have &s;old that little they have; as I &s;aw in this la&s;t War,
<PB N="160" REF="188">
that many were going to do, if it had not &s;oon cea&s;ed. And this the more, becau&s;e that in all this Militia there is almo&s;t no Souldier that hath not wife and children, &s;ervants and &s;laves, that look for this pay, and have no other hope of relief. And hence it is, that many wonder, con&s;idering the huge number of per&s;ons living of pay (which amounts to millions) whence &s;uch va&s;t Revenues can be had for &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Charges: Although this need not to be &s;o much wondred at, con&s;idering the Riches of the Empire, the peculiar Government of the State, and the &s;aid univer&s;al propriety of the Sove|reign.</P>
<P>You may add to all this, that the Grand <HI>Mogol</HI> keeps nigh him at <HI>Dehly</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and thereabout, two or three thou&s;and brave Hor&s;es, to be always ready upon occa&s;ion; as al&s;o eight or nine hundred Elephants, and a va&s;t number of Mules, Hor&s;es, and Por|ters, to carry all the great Tents and their Cabinets, to carry his Wives, Kitchens, Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff,
<PB N="161" REF="188">
<HI>Ganges</HI>-Water, and all the other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Field, which he hath always about him as if he were at home; things not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary in our Kingdoms.</P>
<P>To this may be added tho&s;e incredi|ble Expences upon the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> more indi&s;pen&s;able than will be ea&s;i|ly believed; that va&s;t &s;tore of fine Linnen, Cloth of Gold, Embroide|ries, Silks, Musk, Amber, Pearls, &s;weet E&s;&s;ences, &amp;c. con&s;umed there.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Charges being put to|gether, and compared with the Re|venues the <HI>Mogol</HI> may be thought to have, it will be ea&s;ie to judge, whether he be indeed &s;o very rich, as he is made to be. As for me, I ve|ry well know, that it cannot be de|nied, that he hath very great Reve|nues; I believe, he hath more alone than the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> and the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> both together: But then, to believe all tho&s;e extravagant Sto|ries made of the va&s;tne&s;s of his Re|venues, is a thing I could never do: And if I &s;hould believe the be&s;t part
<PB N="162" REF="189">
of them, yet &s;hould I not believe him in effect and truly &s;o rich, as the World rings of him; unle&s;s a man would &s;ay, that a Trea&s;urer, who re|ceiveth great &s;ums of Money from one hand at the &s;ame time when he is ob|liged to disbur&s;e them to another, were therefore truly rich. For my part, I &s;hould count that King rich indeed, who, without oppre&s;&s;ing and impoveri&s;hing his People too much, &s;hould have a Revenue &s;ufficient to keep a Great and Gallant Court (af|ter the manner of that of ours, or otherwi&s;e) and a Militia &s;ufficient both to guard his Kingdom, and to make an important War for divers years again&s;t his Neighbours; as al|&s;o to &s;hew liberality, to build &s;ome Royal Edifices, and to make tho&s;e other Expences which Kings are wont to make according to their particu|lar Inclinations; and who, be&s;ides all this, &s;hould be able to put up in his Trea&s;ury, for a Re&s;erve, Sums big enough to undertake and maintain a good War for &s;ome years. Now I
<PB N="163" REF="189">
am apt enough to believe, that the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> enjoyeth very near the&s;e Advantages, but I cannot per&s;wade my &s;elf, that he hath them in that ex|ce&s;s, as is thought and pretended. Tho&s;e va&s;t and unevitable Expences, that I have taken notice of, will cer|tainly incline you to my opinion with|out any other con&s;ideration; but you will doubtle&s;s be altogether of my mind, when I &s;hall have repre&s;ented to you the&s;e two things, which I am very well informed of.</P>
<P>The <HI>one</HI> is, that the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> now reigning, about the end of this la&s;t Revolution, though the King|dom was every where in peace (ex|cept in <HI>Bengale,</HI> where <HI>Sultan-Sujah</HI> yet held out) was much perplexed where to find means for the &s;ub&s;i|&s;tence of his Armies, though they were not &s;o well paid as at other times, and the War la&s;ted no lon|ger than five years or thereabout, and though al&s;o he had laid hold of a good part of the Trea&s;ury of his Fa|ther <HI>Chah-Jehan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="190">
The <HI>other</HI> is, That all this Trea&s;ure of <HI>Chah-jehan,</HI> who was very frugal, and had Reigned above forty Years without con&s;iderable Wars, never mounted to &s;ix <HI>Kourours</HI> of <HI>Roupies.</HI> A <HI>Roupy</HI> is about twenty nine pence. An hundred thou&s;and of them make a <HI>Lecque,</HI> and an hundred <HI>Lecques</HI> make one <HI>Kourour.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">So that the &s;ix <HI>Kourours</HI> would make about &s;even Millions and an half <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mo|ney.</NOTE> 'Tis true, I do not compre|hend in this great Trea|&s;ure that great abun|dance of Gold-&s;miths work, &s;o variou&s;ly wrought in Gold and Silver; nor that va&s;t &s;tore of precious Stones and Pearls of a very high value. I doubt, whether there be any King in the World that hath more. The Throne alone, cover'd with them, is valued at lea&s;t three <HI>Kourours,</HI> if I remember aright; But then, it is to be con&s;ider'd al&s;o, that they are the &s;poils of tho&s;e ancient Princes, the <HI>Patans</HI> and <HI>Rajas,</HI> ga|thered and piled up from Immemorial times, and &s;till increa&s;ing from one King to another, by the Pre&s;ents which

the <HI>Omrahs</HI> are obliged yearly at cer|tain Fe&s;tival-days to make him; and which are e&s;teemed to be the Jewels of the Crown, which it would be criminal to touch, and upon which a King of <HI>Mogol</HI> in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity would find it very hard to procure the lea&s;t Sum.</P>
<P>But before I conclude, I &s;hall take notice, whence it may proceed, that though this Empire of <HI>Mogol</HI> be thus an Aby&s;s of Gold and Silver, (as hath been &s;aid,) yet notwith&s;tanding there appears no more of it among the Peo|ple, than el&s;ewhere; yea, rather that the People is there le&s;s Monied than in other places.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> rea&s;on is, that much of it is con&s;umed in melting over and over all tho&s;e No&s;e and Ear-rings, Chains, Finger-rings, Bracelets of Hands and Feet, which the Women wear, but chiefly in that incredible quantity of Manufactures, wherein &s;o much is &s;pent, which is lo&s;t, as in all tho&s;e Embroideries, Silk-&s;tuffs, enter|woven with Gold and Silver, Cloath,

Scarf, Turbants, &amp;c. of the &s;ame: For generally all that Militia loveth to be guided from the <HI>Omrahs</HI> to the meane&s;t Souldiers with their Wives and Children, though they &s;hould &s;tarve at home.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> That all the Lands of the Kingdom being the Kings proprie|ty, they are given either as Benefices, which they call <HI>Jah-ghirs,</HI> or, as in <HI>Turky, Timars,</HI> to men of the Militia for their Pay or Pen&s;ion (as the word <HI>Jah-ghir</HI> imports:) Or el&s;e they are given to the Governours for their Pen|&s;ion, and the entertainment of their Troops, on condition that of the &s;urplus of tho&s;e Land-revenues they give yearly a certain &s;um to the King, as Farmers; Or, la&s;tly, the King re&s;erveth them for him&s;elf as a parti|cular Domaine of his Hou&s;e, which never or very &s;eldom are given as <HI>Jah-ghirs,</HI> and upon which he keeps Far|mers, who al&s;o mu&s;t give him a year|ly &s;um; which is to &s;ay, that the <HI>Ti|mariots, Governours</HI> and <HI>Farmers</HI> have an ab&s;olute Authority over the Coun|try-men,
<PB N="167" REF="191">
and even a very great one over the Trade&s;-men and Merchants of the Towns, Boroughs, and Vil|lages, depending from them: &s;o that in tho&s;e parts there are neither great Lords nor Parliaments, nor Pre&s;idial Courts, as among&s;t us, to keep the&s;e People in awe; nor <HI>Kadis</HI> or Judges powerful enough to hinder and repre&s;s their violence; Nor, in a word, any per&s;on; to whom a Country-man, Trade&s;-man, or Merchant, can make his complaints to, in ca&s;es of extor|tion and tyranny, often practi&s;ed up|on them, by the Souldiery and Go|vernours, who every where do im|punely abu&s;e the Authority Royal, which they have in hand, unle&s;s it be perhaps a little in tho&s;e places that are near to Capital Cities, as <HI>Dehly</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and in great Towns, and con|&s;iderable Sea-ports of the Provinces, whence they know that the com|plaints can be more ea&s;ily conveyed to the Court.

<PB N="168" REF="192">
Governours more than any Slave doth of his Ma&s;ter: that ordinarily they affect to appear poor and Money-le&s;s, very mean in their Apparel, Lodging, Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, and yet more in Meat and Drink; that often they appre|hend even to meddle with Trade, le&s;t they &s;hould be thought Rich, and &s;o fall into the danger of being ruined: So that at la&s;t they find no other reme|dy to &s;ecure their Wealth, than to hide and dig their Money deep under Ground, thus getting out of the or|dinary commerce of Men, and &s;o Dying, neither the King nor the State having any benefit by it.

tho&s;e Timariots, Governours, and Farmers: The Kings, how well &s;oe|ver they be di&s;po&s;ed toward their peo|ple, are never almo&s;t in a condition (as I lately noted) to get Ju&s;tice admini|&s;tred to them, and to hinder tyran|nies; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e great Domi|nions, and in the Provinces remote from the Capital Towns; Which yet ought to be, as doubtle&s;s it is, one of the chief employments and con&s;idera|rations of a King. Be&s;ides, this tyran|ny often grows to that exce&s;s, that it takes away what is nece&s;&s;ary to the life of a Pea&s;ant or Trade&s;-man, who is &s;tarved for hunger and mi&s;ery, who gets no Children, or if he does, &s;ees them die young for want of food; or that abandons his Land, and turns &s;ome Cavalier's man, or flies whither he may to his neighbours, in hopes of fin|ding a better condition. In a word, the Land is not tilled but almo&s;t by force, and con&s;equently very ill, and much of it is quite &s;poiled and ruined, there be|ing none to be found, that can or will be at the charge of entertaining the

ditches and channels for the cour&s;e of waters to be conveyed to nece&s;&s;ary places; nor any body that care to build Hou&s;es, or to repair tho&s;e that are rui|nous; the Pea&s;ant rea&s;oning thus with him&s;elf: Why &s;hould I toil &s;o much for a Tyrant that may come to morrow to take all away from me, or at lea&s;t all the be&s;t of what I have, and not leave, if the fancy taketh him, &s;o much as to &s;u&s;tain my life even very poorly? And the Timariot, the Governour and the Farmer, will rea&s;on thus with him&s;elf; Why &s;hould I be&s;tow Mo|ney and take pains of bettering or maintaining this Land, &s;ince I mu&s;t every hour expect to have it taken from me, or exchanged for another? I labour neither for my &s;elf nor for my Children; and that place which I have this year, I may perhaps have no more the next. Let us draw from it what we can, whil&s;t we po&s;|&s;e&s;s it, though the Pea&s;ant &s;hould break or &s;tarve, though the Land &s;hould be|come a de&s;ert, when I am gone!</P>

the beauty and exactne&s;s of Arts had been quite lo&s;t in tho&s;e parts long ago, if it were not that the Kings and Gran|dees there did give wages to certain Workmen, that work in their Hou&s;es, and there teach their Children, and en|deavour to make them&s;elves able in or|der to be a little more con&s;idered, and to e&s;cape the <HI>Korrah;</HI> and if al&s;o it were not, that tho&s;e great and rich Mer|chants of Towns, who are protected by good and powerful Patrons, pay'd tho&s;e workmen a little better: I &s;ay, <HI>a little Better;</HI> for, what fine &s;tuffs &s;o|ever we &s;ee come from tho&s;e Coun|treys, we mu&s;t not imagine, that the workman is there in any honour, or comes to any thing; 'tis nothing but meer nece&s;&s;ity or the cudgel, that makes him work, he never grows rich; it is no &s;mall matter, when he hath where|with to live and to cloath him&s;elf nar|rowly.

For, where would be tho&s;e Princes, tho&s;e Prelates, tho&s;e Nobles, tho&s;e rich Ci|tizens and great Merchants, and tho&s;e famous Artizans, tho&s;e Towns of <HI>Pa|ris, Lyons, Thoulou&s;e, Rou&euml;n, London,</HI> and &s;o many others?

<P>A word to our dear and experienc'd Travellers: They would not find tho&s;e fair conveniencies of travelling; they would be obliged to carry all things with them, like the <HI>Bohemians;</HI> and all tho&s;e good Inns, for example, that are found between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Lyons,</HI> would be like ten or twelve wretched <HI>Caravans-&s;errahs,</HI> that is, great Barns, rai&s;ed and paved, &s;uch as our <HI>Pont-neuf</HI> is, where hundreds of men are found pel-mel together with their Hor&s;es, Mules and Camels, where one is &s;ti|fled with heat in Summer, and &s;tar|ved of cold in Winter, if it were not for the breathing of tho&s;e Animals, that warm the place a little.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, we &s;ee &s;ome States, where the <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> is
<PB N="185" REF="199">
not (as for example, that of the Grand <HI>Seignor,</HI> which we know better than any, without going &s;o far as the <HI>Indies)</HI> that do not only &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but are al&s;o ve|ry powerful, and encrea&s;e daily.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that that State of the Grand <HI>Seignor,</HI> of &s;uch a prodigious extent as it is, having &s;o va&s;t a quanti|ty of Lands, the Soil of which is &s;o excellent, that it cannot be de&s;troyed but very difficultly, and in a long time, is yet rich and populous; but it is certain al&s;o, that if it were cultiva|ted and peopled proportionably to ours (which it would be, if there were pro|priety among the Subjects throughout) it would be a quite different thing; it would have people enough to rai&s;e &s;uch prodigious Armies as in old times, and rich enough to maintain them. We have travelled through almo&s;t all the parts of it; we have &s;een how &s;trangely it is ruin'd and unpeopled; and how in the Capital City there now need three whole Months to rai&s;e five or &s;ix thou&s;and men. We know al&s;o, what it would have come to ere this,
<PB N="154" REF="200">
if it had not been for the great num|ber of Chri&s;tian Slaves, that are brought into it from all parts. And no doubt but that, if the &s;ame Govern|ment were continued there for a num|ber of years, that State would de&s;troy it &s;elf, and at la&s;t, fall by its own weakne&s;s, as it &s;eems that already it is hardly maintained but only by that means, I mean, by the frequent change of Governors; there being not one Governor, nor any one man in the whole Empire, that hath a penny to enable him to maintain the lea&s;t thing, or that can almo&s;t find any men, if he had Money. A &s;trange manner to make States to &s;ub&s;i&s;t! There would need no more for making an end of the Se|ditions, than a <HI>Brama</HI> of <HI>Pegu,</HI> who killed the half of the Kingdom with hunger, and turned it into Fore&s;ts, hindring for &s;ome years the Lands from being tilled, though yet he hath not &s;ucceeded in his De&s;ign, and the State have afterwards been divided, and that even lately <HI>Ava,</HI> the Capi|tal Town, was upon the point of be|ing
<PB N="155" REF="200">
taken by an handful of <HI>China</HI>-fugi|tives. Mean time we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that we are not like to &s;ee in our dayes that total ruine and de&s;truction of this Empire we are &s;peaking of (if &s;o be we &s;ee not &s;omething wor&s;e) becau&s;e it hath Neighbors, that are &s;o far from being able to undertake any thing a|gain&s;t him, that they are not &s;o much as in a condition to re&s;i&s;t him, unle&s;s it be by tho&s;e &s;uccours of &s;trangers, which the remotene&s;s and jealou&s;ie would make &s;low, &s;mall, and &s;u|&s;pect.</P>
<P>But it might be yet further objected, that it appears not, why &s;uch States as the&s;e might not have good Laws, and why the people in the Provinces might not be enabled to come and make their complaints to a Grand <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> or to the King him&s;elf. 'Tis true, that they are not altogether de&s;titute of good Laws, and that, if tho&s;e which are among&s;t them were ob&s;erved, there would be as good living there, as in any part of the world. But what are tho&s;e Laws good for, if they be not ob&s;er|ved,
<PB N="158" REF="201">
and if there be no means to make them to be executed? Is it not the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ir,</HI> or the King that appoints for the people &s;uch beggarly Tyrants, and that hath no others to &s;et over them? Is it not He that &s;ells tho&s;e go|vernments? Hath a poor Pea&s;ant or Trade&s;man means to make great jour|neys, and to come and &s;eek for Ju&s;tice in the Capital City, remote perhaps 150 or 200 Leagues from the place of his abode? Will not the Governour cau&s;e him to be made away in his jour|ney (as it hath often hapned) or catch him &s;ooner or later? And will he not provide his Friends at Court, to &s;upport him there, and to repre&s;ent things quite otherwi&s;e than they are? In a word, this Governour, hungry as well as the Timariots and Farmers (that are all men for drawing Oyl out of Sand, as the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;peaks, and for ruining a world, with their heap of Women-harpies, Children and Slaves) this Governor, I &s;ay, is he not the ab|&s;olute Ma&s;ter, the Super-intendant of Ju&s;tice, the Parliament, the Receiver, and all?</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="201">
It may perhaps be added, that the Lands, which our Kings hold in <HI>Do|maine,</HI> are no le&s;s well tilled and peo|pled, than other Land. But there is a great difference between the having in propriety &s;ome Lands here and there in a great Kingdom (which changes not the Con&s;titution of the State and Government) and the having them all in propriety, which would alter it altogether. And then we in the&s;e parts have Laws &s;o rational, which our Kings are willing to be the fir&s;t to ob|&s;erve, and according to which they will that their particular Lands &s;hall be governed as tho&s;e of their Subjects are, &s;o as to give way, that Actions of Law may be laid again&s;t their own Far|mers and Officers, &s;o that a Pea&s;ant or Trade&s;man may have means to obtain Ju&s;tice, and to find remedy again&s;t the unju&s;t violence of tho&s;e that would oppre&s;s him: Whereas in tho&s;e parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> I &s;ee almo&s;t not any refuge for tho&s;e poor people; the Cudgel and the Hammer of the Governour being in a manner the only Law that rules,
<PB N="188" REF="202">
and decides all Controver&s;ies there.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, It may be &s;aid, that 'tis at lea&s;t certain, that in &s;uch States there is not &s;uch a multitude of long-la&s;ting &s;utes of Law, as in the&s;e parts, nor &s;o many Lawyers of all &s;orts, as among&s;t us. It is in my opinion, very true, that one cannot too much applaud that old <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Saing, <HI>Na-hac Kouta Beter-Ez hac Deraz,</HI> that is, <HI>Short Injustice is better than long Ju&s;tice;</HI> and that the length of Law-Sutes is un&s;ufferable in a State, and that it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of the Sovereign, by all good means to endeavour a remedy again&s;t them. And 'tis certain, that by ta|king away this <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> the root would be cut of an infinite num|ber of Law-proce&s;&s;es, and e&s;pecially of almo&s;t all tho&s;e, that are of impor|tance, and long and perplexed; and con&s;equently there would not need &s;o great a number of Magi&s;trates, which our Sovereigns do employ to ad|mini&s;ter Ju&s;tice to their Subjects, nor that &s;warm of men, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t only by that way. But 'tis al&s;o manife&s;t,
<PB N="189" REF="202">
that the remedy would be an hundred times wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;ide|ring tho&s;e great inconveniences that would follow thereupon, and that in all probability the Magi&s;trates would become &s;uch as tho&s;e of the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> States, who de&s;erve not that Name; for in a word, our Kings have yet cau&s;e to glory upon the account of good Magi&s;tracy under them. In tho&s;e parts, &s;ome Merchants excepted, Ju|&s;tice is only among the meane&s;t &s;ort of people, that are poor and of an une|qual condition, who have not the means of corrupting the Judges, and to buy fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, that are there in great numbers, and very cheap, and never puni&s;hed. And this I have learn'd every where by the experience of many years, and by my &s;olicitous enquiries made among the people of the Country, and our old Merchants that are in tho&s;e parts, as al&s;o of Am|ba&s;&s;adors, Con&s;uls and Interpreters; whatever our common Travellers may &s;ay, who, upon their having &s;een by chance, when they pa&s;&s;ed by, two or
