<P>_WHereas the Merchants of this Our Kingdom trading to the Seven I&s;lands formerly called the <HI>Fortunate I&s;lands,</HI> and now known by the name of the <HI>Canary-I&s;lands,</HI> and more particularly by the names of <HI>Grand Canaria, Theneriffe, Palma, Lean&s;erot, Fuerte Ventura, Gomera, &amp; Hierro,</HI> did heretofore carry on that Trade, to the great benefit and advantage of Our good Subjects, by Exporting great quantities of the Native Commodities, and other the Manufactures of this Our Kingdom, and in Exchange thereof Importing the Wines and other Goods there, received at &s;uch Rates that the &s;ame were u&s;ually Retailed at very ea&s;ie and moderate Prices; But of late years it hath &s;o fallen out, by rea&s;on of the irregular &amp; di&s;orderly Trading of Retailers and other per&s;ons no ways experi|enced in that Trade and of their extraordinary and un&s;ea&s;onable re&s;ort unto the &s;aid I&s;lands with an unu&s;ual number of Ships, That the Prices of tho&s;e Wines have been exceedingly enhanced, and the Commodities and Manufactures of Our Kingdoms deba&s;ed in their value, by the Inhabitants of the &s;aid I&s;lands; and Our Subjects enforced to pay for a great part of tho&s;e Wines with Pieces of Eight, to the decay of the Trade, and decrea&s;e of the Trea&s;ure of Our King|doms. For prevention of which mi&s;chief, We were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed by Our Letters Patents, bearing date the Seven|teenth day of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, to erect a Corporation, by the name of <HI>The Governour and Company of Merchants Trading to the Canary-I&s;lands,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Merchants therein particularly named, and all other Our Engli&s;h Subjects who have lived in the &s;aid I&s;lands as Merchants or Factours, and were in Trade thither at the time of the Grant of Our &s;aid Letters Patents; or have for Seven years la&s;t pa&s;t traded thither, to the value of One thou&s;and pounds a year,
<PB REF="2"> or upwards, being meer Merchants, and no Retailers, nor of any other Profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch as at any time hereafter &s;hould be admitted as Members of the &s;aid Company, according to the tenour of Our &s;aid Letters Patents: which &s;aid Corporation We were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed likewi&s;e to endow with &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary Priviledges and Immunities for the better enabling of them to carry on the Regulation of the &s;aid Trade, granting unto the &s;aid Company the whole, entire, and &s;ole Trade to, at, and from the &s;aid I&s;lands; and with general Prohibitions and Re&s;traints of all others, not being Members of the &s;aid Corporation, to Trade or Traffick to, at, or from the &s;aid I&s;lands for Canary Wines, or any other Goods what&s;oever, or to Import from any other Port or place into any of Our Dominions any Wines, Goods, or Merchandi&s;es of the Growth, Production, or Manufacture of the &s;aid I&s;lands, or any of them, contrary to the tenour of Our &s;aid Letters Patents. We therefore re&s;olving to encourage and &s;upport the &s;aid Corporation, and not to &s;uffer any violation or diminution of tho&s;e Priviledges which We have granted unto them for the ends afore&s;aid, Do hereby publi&s;h Our Royal Will and Plea&s;ure unto all per&s;ons, as well Subjects as Strangers, &s;traitly charging and commanding them and every of them, That they pre&s;ume not at any time hereafter to do, or attempt any thing again&s;t the Rights and Priviledges of the &s;aid Company, or in derogation of Our Charter and Letters Patents to them granted, as they will an&s;wer the contrary at their perils. And to the end that the Charter and Government of the &s;aid Fellow&s;hip may be the better put in execution, And to the intent that all Offenders again&s;t the &s;ame may be di&s;covered and brought to Iu&s;tice, and &s;uch puni&s;hment inflicted upon them for &s;uch their offences, as by the &s;aid Char|ter, and other the Orders and Con&s;titutions of the &s;aid Company ought to be inflicted on &s;uch as wilfully and contemp|tuou&s;ly tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t Our Charter and this Our Proclamation; In pur&s;uance of the &s;ame, We do further by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council hereby Will and Command, as well the Iudges of Our High Courts of Admiralty, as the Mar&s;hal and under-Officers of the &s;ame, as al&s;o all and every Our Farmers or Commi&s;&s;ioners of Our Cu&s;toms for the time being, and the Searchers of Our Cu&s;toms in all Ports of Our Dominions, and the &s;everal Officers of what kind &s;oever belonging to, and attending the &s;ervice of Our Cu&s;toms; as al&s;o all Our Admirals, Vice-Admirals, Commanders, Captains, and Officers what&s;oever of any of Our Royal Ships, or any of Our Ca&s;tles, Blockhou&s;es, and Forts re&s;pectively, and all other Our Officers and Mini&s;ters in their &s;everal places, to be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting unto the &s;aid Governour and Company of Merchants trading into the Canary I&s;lands, and all &s;uch as they &s;hall employ, in all matters and things tending to the Supportation of the Government of the &s;aid Company, and Re|gulation of their Trade, and for pre&s;ervation of their Priviledges, Iuri&s;dictions and Immunities by Our Royal Charter to them granted as afore&s;aid.</P>
