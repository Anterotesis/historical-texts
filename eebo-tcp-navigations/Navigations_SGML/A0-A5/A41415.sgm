<HEAD TYPE="sub">With a Particular Relation of the Blowing-up of Six of the Bigge&s;t of the <HI>FRENCH</HI> Men of War; The Breaking the Lines of the <HI>FRENCH;</HI> And &s;everal other Occurrences.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday the 23th. in|&s;tant, the Earl of <HI>Tor|rington</HI> Sailed with their Maje&s;ties Fleet from St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> and the <HI>Spithead;</HI> the Wind being at North-Ea&s;t, and &s;tood to|ward the <HI>French</HI> Fleet (which, as the Advice Boats brought an Ac|count, lay at Anchor about two Leagues from Shore, off of <HI>Fre&s;h|water-gate</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le of Wight</HI>) with a Re&s;olution to Fight the <HI>French;</HI> but the Witd coming about, and taking them &s;hort, he came to an Anchor, off of a place called <HI>Dun|no&s;e,</HI> which is within Five Leagues, or Fifteen Engli&s;h Miles, of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, who were removed, and were at Auchor in <HI>Compton-Bay.</HI> The next day, being Tue&s;|day, about Three in the Morning, there came up with us, and joyned our Fleet, &s;everal Men of War, <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and in the E|vening, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral <HI>Evertz|zen,</HI> in a Ship of Ninety delicate Bra&s;s Guns, with Two <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War more, one of which was a Rear Admiral. Al&s;o their Ma|je&s;ties Ships, the <HI>Lyon</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;tant Warwick,</HI> all joyned our Fleet.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, about Five in the Morning, our Admiral, the Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> &s;tood to the We&s;tward, the Wind at South and by Ea&s;t, with a Windward Tide; and about Noon they were with|in fight of <HI>Dunno&s;e Point,</HI> about Four Leagues from the Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet &s;tood at the &s;ame time to the Ea&s;t-ward, being
<PB N="2" REF="2">at the like di&s;tance from the Shore; and about Three of the Clock in the Afternoon, the two Fleets were within a little above a League of each other; &s;o that it was verily expected an Engagement would immediately en&s;ue, by the Di&s;po|&s;ition of the <HI>French</HI> in their &s;eem|ing to meet us; but on a &s;udden, the Admiral of the <HI>French</HI> Ordered a Gun to be Fired, and Tacqued about, and the re&s;t of the Fleet &s;tood after and followed him; who &s;teered directly We&s;t-ward, and from us. Our Fleet follow'd them till Night, but we could not reach them near enough to Engage.</P>
<P>The next day being Thur&s;day the 26th. the <HI>French</HI> Fleet came to an Anchor, on the South &s;ide of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday there aro&s;e &s;o great a Mi&s;t and Fog, that both the Fleets continued at Anchor.</P>
<P>Nothing of moment happened on Saturday.</P>
<P>On Sunday, being the 29th. in the Morning, there joyn'd our Ad|miral, Their Maje&s;ties Ships the <HI>Mil|ford</HI> and <HI>Garland,</HI> and a Dutch Man of War of 72 Guns. And in the Afternoon, our Advice-Boats brought Word, That the <HI>French</HI> Fleet had weighed Anchor, and were put to Sea; upon which, our Fleet weighed likewi&s;e, and made towards the <HI>French,</HI> who &s;teered their Cour&s;e as if they had endea|voured to get the Wind of us, or rather to avoid Fighting, and make for their own Coa&s;t, would the Wind have permitted them.</P>
<P>And Ye&s;terday, being Monday, (the 30th. In&s;tant) about Eight in the Morning, our Fleet came up with the <HI>French</HI> (who &s;teered Ea&s;t|ward) early in the Morning, near the. <HI>Beechy,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> about Three Leagues off of the Shoar: And the two Fleets being drawn up into Lines, in order of Battel, ours in the Form of a Half-Moon, immediately the two Ad|mirals advanced at the Head of their Squadrons; and &s;everal S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ots be|exchanged by each Fleet's Defiance-Frigats and Advice-Boats, about Ten a Clock a mo&s;t furious and bloody Fight en&s;ued between both Fleets, engaging Board and Board; which though it continued, till Night put an end, yet 'tis ob&s;er|vable, That after a few Hours, we took the Lines of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and put them into great Confu&s;i|on. They Fought retreating for &s;everal Hours before Night, and tis thought this Morning our Fleet has engaged them again, the Wind 'being &s;till at Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t; &s;o that they cannot well e&s;cape us, by making to any of their own Ports that can harbour them, the neare&s;t <HI>French</HI> Ports being <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Calice,</HI> neither of which can har|bour their great Men of War, by rea&s;on of the &s;hallowne&s;s of the waters, that they cannot get over the Bars: So that we Doubt not, but our Fleet (by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD) will de&s;troy mo&s;t of the <HI>French,</HI> before we let them go off from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The particulars of this Engage|ment, al&s;o what Ships we have Taken, Sunk, and Men Killed, is expected with grert impatience: But &s;everal Gentlemen from the Hills of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> with their Tele|&s;copes, affirm, that they &s;aw Six large Ships of the <HI>French</HI> on Fire, one of which being the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> a Ship of 110 Bra&s;s Guns; on Board of which was their Grand Admiral M. <HI>Turville.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we &s;ee how the great Monarch of the Univer&s;e, and So|veraign Di&s;po&s;er of all Sublunary things, is graciou&s;ly pleas'd to ble&s;s their Maje&s;ties Armes, as well by Sea as Land; to be, in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, in&s;trumental in pulling down the <HI>French</HI> Tyrant, who has arrived to that pitch of Pride and Vain glory (like the great Tyrant in the Go&s;pel) that neither fear'd G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">d, nor regarded Man.</P>
