<P>The 3. day of Februarie about 10. of the clocke afore noone, wee had &s;ight of the <HI>Cape Bona e&s;per|an&s;e</HI> a Frenchman which we left in the roade of <HI>A|chin</HI> being in our company, which came out a day after vs, who together had determined to goe for <HI>Saldauia</HI> if two Flemmings who came then into our company had not altered our determination, for af|ter wee had hailed them, wee vnder&s;tood they were vnwilling to put in for that place, but to goe for <HI>Saint Hellena,</HI> &s;o we &s;toode along with them, and altogether ariued at <HI>Saint Hellena.</HI></P>

<P>The generall of the Flemmings who&s;e name is <HI>Iacob Cornelius Van Neskes</HI> toulde vs that there is Pepper enough to lade foure or fiue Ships, &s;o that if the <HI>Dragon</HI> came there in any time con|uenient it is not to bee doubted but they are vppon the waye homewardes full laden with Pepper, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Frenchmen haue determined &s;uddaine|ly to leaue our companye to depart homewardes, which hath made mee to trouble you with this di&s;cour&s;e, although not &s;o large as willingly I would it were, for that time will not per|mitte mee to doe otherwi&s;e, hoping that it will not bee any thing di&s;plea&s;ing vnto you, hauing as I thinke not before this heard any cer|tainety
