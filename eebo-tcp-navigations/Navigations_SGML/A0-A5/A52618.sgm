INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Advantages of taking judicious and
accurate Journals in Voyages and Itineraries,
are &s;o great and many, as the Improvements
of</HI> Geography, Hydrography, A&s;tronomy, Na|tural
<HI>and</HI> Moral Hi&s;tory, Antiquity, Merchan|di&s;e,
Trade, Empire, <HI>&amp;c. that few Books can com|pare
with them either for Profit or Plea&s;ure. There|fore</HI>
Ramu&s;io, <HI>the</HI> De Brys, Hackluit, Purchas,
John de Laet, Thevenot, <HI>&amp;c. have begun a very
commendable De&s;ign, and their Works are like to be
always u&s;eful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Collection now publi&s;hed, containing &s;ome curi|ous
Voyages, and accurate Journals, never before
printed, both towards the</HI> South <HI>and</HI> North, <HI>beyond
and through the</HI> Magellan Streights; <HI>as al&s;o to</HI>
Greenland <HI>or</HI> Spitsberg, Nova Zembla, <HI>and</HI>
Groneland <HI>or</HI> Groyneland. <HI>'Twill be nece&s;&s;ary to

premi&s;e in general, what other</HI> Navigators <HI>have gone
before to tho&s;e parts, and what additional Knowledge
may be reap'd from the</HI> en&s;uing Work; <HI>in doing of
which, we &s;hall ob&s;erve Order of</HI> Place <HI>and</HI> Time.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t of &s;ome Di&s;coveries and Navigations towards
the Southern Parts of the Globe,</HI> South-We&s;t <HI>and</HI>
South-Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>A. D. 1519. Ferdinand Magalianes, <HI>a</HI> Portu|gue&s;e
<HI>Gentleman, upon &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t taken at his Ma&s;ter
King</HI> Emanuel, <HI>applied him&s;elf to the Court of</HI> Ca|&s;tile,
<HI>offering to make great Di&s;coveries of the rich</HI>
Spice-I&s;lands <HI>by the We&s;t, and to &s;ail round the Globe.
He was furni&s;h'd with five Ships and 250 Men, by
the Command of</HI> Charles V. <HI>They departed from</HI>
Sevil <HI>Augu&s;t 10. 1519. and after having in vain
attempted to pa&s;s through by the great River</HI> La Plate,
<HI>and having winter'd in</HI> Port S. Julian, <HI>they found out
a great</HI> Streight <HI>leading into the South Sea, called af|terwards,
by the Inventor's Name, the</HI> Magellan
Streight; <HI>through which he was the fir&s;t that pa&s;&s;ed
from the</HI> Atlantick <HI>into the</HI> Pacifick Ocean, <HI>and &s;o
round the Globe home again by the</HI> Molucco'<HI>s and</HI>
Cape of Good Hope, <HI>having &s;pent above three
years in this Circumnavigation. Entring the Streight
of his own Name, he found on the Shoar many Sepul|chres
or Graves, whither the Inhabitants re&s;ort in
the Summer time to bury their Dead; he al&s;o ob&s;erv'd
a great Whale thrown up, and many Bones.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1525. Garcias de Loya&s;a <HI>a</HI> Spani|ard,
<HI>entred into</HI> Magellan's Streight, <HI>and gave
Names to &s;everal Places; as did al&s;o</HI> Simon de Alca|zova
<HI>in the year</HI> 1534. <HI>Afterwards the Bi&s;hop of</HI>
Placentia <HI>fitted out three Ships, in the Year 1539,
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
one of which got through the Streights of</HI> Magellan
<HI>to</HI> Arica <HI>in</HI> Peru.</P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1577. <HI>Sir</HI> Francis Drake, <HI>with
five Ships and Barks, and I64 Men, began his Fa|mous
Voyage round the Globe; &s;ailing through the a|forementioned
Streight of</HI> Magellan <HI>to the Coa&s;ts of</HI>
Peru, New Spain, Mexico, <HI>and</HI> California; <HI>re|turning
to</HI> England, <HI>by the</HI> Ea&s;t Indies, <HI>and</HI> Cape
of Good Hope. <HI>Captain</HI> John Winter <HI>was &s;epara|ted
from Sir</HI> Francis <HI>upon their Entrance into the</HI>
South Sea, <HI>and by Storms was forced back again into
the Streights of</HI> Magellan, <HI>through which he repa&s;|&s;ed
home, being the fir&s;t that &s;ailed from the</HI> Paci|fick
<HI>into the</HI> Atlantick Ocean, <HI>through the&s;e
Streights.</HI> Ladriller, <HI>a</HI> Spaniard, <HI>being &s;ent from</HI>
Chili, <HI>to attempt this pa&s;&s;age, was driven back by
Storms and the approach of Winter.</HI> Anno 1579.
<HI>the Viceroy of</HI> Peru, <HI>thinking that Sir</HI> Francis
Drake <HI>was &s;ailed to the</HI> Magellan Streights, <HI>equipt</HI>
Don Sarmiento <HI>in the Port of</HI> Lima <HI>with two
Ships to pur&s;ue him. This</HI> Spaniard <HI>coa&s;ted</HI> Chili
<HI>and</HI> Patagonia, <HI>entring the</HI> Streights, <HI>and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed
to</HI> Bra&s;il. Sarmiento <HI>upon his return to</HI> Spain, <HI>per|&s;waded&punc;</HI>
Philip II, <HI>to &s;end two Colonies to plant and
fortifie in the</HI> Streights <HI>of</HI> Magellan, <HI>in order to
prevent and ob&s;truct the Navigations, Depredations,
or Settlements of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and</HI> Dutch <HI>in tho&s;e
parts; but they all mi&s;carried partly by Shipwrack,
partly by Famine, and the Barbarities of the</HI> Pata|gons.
<HI>This happened in the years</HI> 1584, 1585,
1586. <HI>The Project was contrary to the Advice of
the</HI> Duke <HI>of</HI> Alva.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5">
<HI>Sir</HI> Francis, <HI>in the</HI> Magellan Streight, <HI>&s;aw &s;eve|ral
of the</HI> Patagons, <HI>or Inhabitants, in their Canoes
and Huts; their Boats were made of the Barks of
Trees and Seal Skins very artificially interwoven, the
Head whereof was &s;emilunar. They painted their Fa|ces
either with an Earth or a Vegetable. In their
Huts, made of Boughs and Skins of Fi&s;hes, he found</HI>
Sea-Wolves <HI>and huge Mu&s;cles, who&s;e Shells they &s;har|pen
&s;o with rubbing of Stones, that they cut every
thing with them. Their Fre&s;h Water was kept in Ve&s;|&s;els
made of the Barks of Trees, and their Ve&s;tments
were chiefly made up of the Skins of</HI> Penguins, Seals,
<HI>and other Animals peculiar to the Climate.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1586. <HI>The third Circumnavigation
of the Globe was undertaken and performed by</HI> Tho|mas
Candi&s;h <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who very pro&s;perou&s;ly fini&s;h'd
that in two Years and two Months, which took both</HI>
Magellanus <HI>and Sir</HI> Francis Drake <HI>three years in
compa&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1593. <HI>Sir</HI> Richard Hawkins <HI>made his
Voyage into the</HI> South Sea <HI>by the &s;ame Sreight that
the aforementioned Navigators did before him. He
gives the mo&s;t accurate De&s;cription of the Tree that
bears the famous</HI> Winter-bark, <HI>&s;ee his</HI> Ob&s;ervations
in fol. Printed 1622. pag. 88. This Spicy Aro|matick
Tree <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> bears Leaves of a whiti&s;h
Green, not unlike the <HI>A&s;pen;</HI> and bears its Fruit
in Clu&s;ters like the <HI>Hawthorn,</HI> but that it is
green; each Berry of the bigne&s;s of a Pepper|corn,
and every one of them containing within
four or five Grains or Seeds, twice as big as Mu|&s;tard
Seed, which broken are white within and
bite like the good Pepper; the Bark hath the
<PB N="ix" REF="5">
Ta&s;te of all Sorts of Spices, very Stomachick
and Medicinal. We found it in all places of the
Streights where any Trees grew. Here are a|bundance
of <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> very refre&s;hing Diet and
full of <HI>Pearl;</HI> al&s;o <HI>Limpets,</HI> and incredible Num|bers
of <HI>Penguins</HI> and <HI>Seals.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1598. <HI>The Fourth Circumnaviga|tion
of the Globe was performed by</HI> Oliver Noort <HI>a</HI>
Dutchman, <HI>his chief Pilot being Captain</HI> Melis <HI>an</HI>
Engli&s;hman, <HI>who had accompanied Mr.</HI> Candi&s;h <HI>in
his Voyage. This</HI> Noort <HI>&s;teer'd much the &s;ame Cour&s;e
with</HI> Magalianes, Drake, <HI>and</HI> Candi&s;h, <HI>having
&s;pent near three years in encompa&s;&s;ing the Earth.
He &s;aw, upon the Land of</HI> Patagonia, <HI>&s;ome Deer,
a &s;ort of</HI> Bufalo, <HI>and</HI> O&s;triches.</P>
<P><HI>We may note here, that in the Year</HI> 1589, <HI>the</HI>
Delight <HI>of</HI> Bri&s;tol, <HI>one of the Con&s;orts of</HI> John
Chidley <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr.</HI> Paul Wheel, <HI>got into the
Streights</HI> of Magellan; <HI>but meeting with Misfor|tunes,
was forced back, having reach'd only</HI> Cape
Froward. <HI>Al&s;o in the year 1598.</HI> Verhagen'<HI>s
Fleet, under Sir</HI> James Mahu, Simon de Cordes,
Sebald de Wert, <HI>&amp;c. wherein</HI> William Adams,
<HI>was chief Pilot, &s;uffered great Mi&s;eries in the&s;e
Streights. This</HI> Sebald de Wert <HI>gave</HI> Clu&s;ius <HI>a
de&s;cription of the Winter-bark-Tree growing up and
down</HI> Patagonia. <HI>They pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves mith</HI>
Gee&s;e, Ducks, <HI>va&s;t large</HI> Mu&s;cles, Penguins,
Seals, <HI>&amp;c. Returning out of the Streight, and
&s;ailing Southwards they di&s;covered</HI> Sebald's I&s;les.</P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1614. George Spilbergen <HI>General
of a</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet of &s;ix Ships, pa&s;&s;ed through the
Streights of</HI> Magellan <HI>and the</HI> South Sea <HI>to the</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="6">
Ea&s;t Indies, <HI>from</HI> whence he returned by the <HI>Cape
of Good Hope</HI> to the <HI>Texel,</HI> having been out
about three years. This was the Fifth Circumnavi|gation
of the Globe.</P>
<P><HI>Ann. Don. 1609, 1610. Pedro Fernandez Gi|ros</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and Captain <HI>Ferdinand de Quir</HI>
a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> do both affirm, That they &s;ailed at &s;eve|ral
times above 800 Leagues together on the Coa&s;t
of a <HI>Southern Continent,</HI> until they came to the
height of 15 degrees of <HI>South Latitude,</HI> where they
found a very fruitful, plea&s;ant, and populous Coun|try.
<HI>Giros</HI> began to take his Cour&s;e in the height
of the Streights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> This va&s;t Tract of
Land perhaps may be one &s;ide of, or may belong to,
<HI>Jan&s;en Ta&s;men's Land, Van Diemen's Land,
Zelandia Nova, Hollandia Nova, Carpentaria,</HI>
and <HI>New Guiney;</HI> which the <HI>Dutch</HI> afterwards
coa&s;ted, detected, and gave Names to many Bays,
Rivers and Capes, in the Years 1619, 1622,1627,
1628, 1642, <HI>and</HI> 1644. from the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> to
44 deg. <HI>South Lat.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have indeed made the greate&s;t
Di&s;coveries towards the South <HI>Terra Incognita,</HI>
which they have not yet divulg'd. <HI>Dirk Rem|brant&s;e</HI>
about 15 or 16 years ago publi&s;hed, in <HI>Low
Dutch,</HI> a &s;hort Relation out of the Journal of Cap|tain
<HI>Abel Jen&s;en Ta&s;men</HI> upon his Di&s;coveries of
the South <HI>Terra Incognita</HI> in the year 1642, to the
Southward of <HI>Nova Hollandia, Vandemen's Land,</HI>
&amp;c. 'Tis remarkable that all the Circumnavigators
of the Globe enter'd into the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> either by the
<HI>Philippines</HI> or the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> being peradventure
hindred from pa&s;&s;ing round more Southwards by that
<PB N="xi" REF="6">
va&s;t long Chain of Land, which &s;eems to &s;tretch
almo&s;t from the <HI>Equinosctial</HI> to the 50 degree of
<HI>South Lat.</HI> Therefore they generally &s;teer'd upon
the <HI>South Sea,</HI> either for the <HI>I&s;les of Salomon,</HI> or
tho&s;e called the <HI>Ladrones.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno Dom. 1615. Will. Cornelius Schouten</HI> of
<HI>Horn,</HI> and <HI>Jacob le Maire</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> under|took
the Sixth Circumnavigation of the Globe, by a
new Pa&s;&s;age Southwards from the Streights of <HI>Ma|gellan</HI>
in <HI>Terra del Fuogo,</HI> which they happily di&s;|covered
and pa&s;&s;ed, finding out <HI>Sebald's-I&s;les, Sta|ten-Land,
Maurice-Land, Barnevelt-I&s;les,</HI> and &s;o
by <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> in the 57deg. of <HI>S. Lat.</HI> they found
out a new way into the <HI>South Sea;</HI> called ever &s;ince
<HI>Le Maire's Streight,</HI> in this Voyage they gave Names
to &s;everal I&s;lands and Countries, returning to <HI>Hol|land</HI>
by the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> having been out two years
and Eighteen days. Aftewards a <HI>Spni&s;h Fleet,</HI> under <HI>Bartolemeo Garcias de Nodal, Anno</HI> 1618.
&s;ailed through <HI>Le Maire's Pa&s;&s;age:</HI> and in the year
1623. part of <HI>Prince Maurice</HI> his Fleet &s;teered the
&s;ame Cour&s;e, di&s;covering &s;ome &s;mall I&s;les. <HI>Nodal</HI>
&s;aw People near <HI>Le Maire's Streight,</HI> all painted and
clad with Birds Skins; they fed upon yellow Flowers
like <HI>Marigolds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno 1643. Brewer,</HI> or <HI>Brower,</HI> went another
way into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> by a Pa&s;&s;age called after his
own Name, which is ea&s;t of <HI>Le Maire's Streight;</HI>
but whether <HI>Brewer</HI> went through a New Streight
with Land on each &s;ide, or had a wide Sea on the Ea&s;t
we cannot inform you, having never &s;een the <HI>Diary</HI>
of his Voyage: but mo&s;t Maps make it a new
Streight, the perhaps he might &s;ail near the &s;ame
<PB N="xii" REF="7">
Cour&s;e which Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> afterwards did; they
who have his Voyage may &s;oon determine this Doubt.</P>
<P>The Southern part of <HI>Terra Magellanica,</HI> com|monly
called <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> from the great Fires
&s;een upon it by the Sailors; &s;eems, by the Ob&s;erva|tions
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to be divided into many <HI>I&s;les</HI>
and <HI>Streights</HI> leading into both Seas. The Country
appears mountainous, with fair and green Vallies,
Springs, Rivulets, and much Herbage. The Creeks
are fit for Shipping, Water and Wood being plenti|ful.
The Air is tempe&s;tuous from the va&s;t quantity of
Vapours from both Oceans. The Natives paint their
Bodies, and deck them&s;elves with Shells and Skins.
They make their Baskets and Nets of Ru&s;hes, out of
which they twi&s;t Lines, and hanging Hooks made of
Stone, and baited with Mu&s;cles, they take abundance
of Fi&s;h. Their Knives are made of &s;harpened Bones,
and all their Arrows are armed with them. Their Ca|noes
are like the <HI>Venetian Gondola's.</HI> For the De&s;cri|ption
of the Northern part of <HI>Terra Magellanica,</HI>
commonly called <HI>Patagonia,</HI> we refer the Reader to
Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI>'s Journal, printed at the be|ginning
of this <HI>Collection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno 1669. His Maje&s;ty</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,
His Royal Highne&s;s</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> and &s;eve|others
of the <HI>Nobility,</HI> de&s;ign'd a better Di&s;covery
of <HI>Chili;</HI> in order whereunto two Ships were &s;ent
out under the Conduct of that great Navigator and
worthy Commander Sir <HI>John Narbrough,</HI> who re|turned
<HI>June 1671,</HI> having been out above two years,
pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and
coa&s;ting <HI>Patagonia</HI> and <HI>Chili.</HI> His Ob&s;ervations
and Draughts are the mo&s;t judicious and exact of
of any that went before him.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="7">
<HI>Anno</HI> 1680. and 1681. Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> made ma|ny
bold Adventures on &s;everal I&s;lands and Coa&s;ts in
the <HI>South Sea.</HI> In his return, he being quite out of
all hopes of recovering the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> or

He built a Pinnace in River <HI>Nel&s;on,</HI> where he found

other &s;orts of Trees, but &s;mall; the Valleys had good
gra&s;s, Black-Berries, Strawberries, Vetches, Veni&s;on,

<P><HI>Anno 1631.</HI> The mo&s;t ingenious Captain <HI>Tho|mas

difficult a work by <HI>King Charles the Fir&s;t;</HI> who was
plea&s;ed to command him to publi&s;h his Voyage in the

<P><HI>Anno 1671. Frederick Martens,</HI> an <HI>Hambur|ger,</HI>
undertook the <HI>Greenland Voyage,</HI> upon a de|&s;ire,
as may be &s;uppos'd, in great part to &s;atisfie the
Curio&s;ity and Enquiries of the <HI>Royal Society;</HI> which
be performed in his admirable <HI>Diary</HI> printed in <HI>High
Dutch</HI> in <HI>Quarto,</HI> being a&s;&s;isted therein by the fa|mous
<HI>Fogelius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno 1676.</HI> The industrious and mo&s;t ingenious
Captain <HI>Wood,</HI> was again &s;ent out by his <HI>Maje&s;ty
King Charles the Second,</HI> to make a more perfect
Di&s;covery of the <HI>North-Ea&s;t Parts</HI> for a pa&s;&s;age to
the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> He went no further than the 76
<HI>Degree</HI> of <HI>North Lat.</HI> where he lo&s;t his Ship on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> His opinion is, there is
no &s;ailing this <HI>North-Ea&s;t Way</HI> to <HI>China, Japan,</HI>
&amp;c. The like opinion Captain <HI>James</HI> hath given of
<PB N="xxvii" REF="14">
the <HI>North-We&s;t Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> being both per&s;waded there|unto
by the <HI>&s;tretching of the Land,</HI> by the <HI>di&s;tra|ction
and rever&s;ion of half Tides,</HI> by the <HI>motion
of the Ice,</HI> &amp;c. be&s;ides the Fogs, Snow, Fro&s;ts, va&s;t
I&s;lands of Ice, and the Weather, are in&s;uperable.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wit&s;en</HI> in his Letter to the <HI>Royal Society
Anno 1691.</HI> writes again&s;t the <HI>North-Ea&s;t Pa&s;&s;age</HI>
to <HI>Japan:</HI> he retracts his former Opinion of making
<HI>Nova Zembla</HI> join upon the <HI>Continent</HI> with <HI>Tar|tary,</HI>
having &s;ince been better inform'd. He thinks
the <HI>Tartarian Points</HI> may run very far North, and
perhaps reach to <HI>America.</HI> Captain <HI>Wood</HI> fancies,
that <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> and <HI>Greenland</HI> are the &s;ame <HI>Con|tinent,</HI>
If the&s;e Conjectures of Captain <HI>James,</HI> Cap|tain
<HI>Wood,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wit&s;en,</HI> concerning the <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI>
and <HI>North-We&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI>
&s;hould not be true, yet the difficulties of &s;ailing tho&s;e
ways would be invincible.</P>
<P>But now it &s;eems convenient to come to the <HI>pre&s;ent
Work,</HI> and to give an account what is contained
therein. The <HI>Authors</HI> are Four, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>John Nar|borough,</HI>
Captain <HI>Jan&s;en Ta&s;man,</HI> Captain <HI>Wood,</HI>
and <HI>Frederick Marten.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> is &s;o well known in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and &s;o famous beyond the Seas, that I need &s;ay
nothing of his great Abilties. His <HI>Voyage</HI> into
the <HI>South-Sea</HI> is mentioned before, but this is the
fir&s;t time of Publi&s;hing it.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Captain <HI>Abel Jan&s;en Ta&s;man's Voyage</HI> from
<HI>Batavia</HI> in the <HI>I&s;land of Java,</HI> to the <HI>South Terra
Incognita</HI> is the more con&s;iderable, in that 'tis the
<HI>Di&s;covery</HI> of a <HI>New World,</HI> not yet known to the
<HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="15">
'Tis probable by <HI>Abel Jan&s;en Ta&s;man's</HI> Navigati|on,
that <HI>New Guinea, New Carpentaria,</HI> and
<HI>New Holland,</HI> are a va&s;t prodigious I&s;land, which

<P><HI>IV. Frederick Marten</HI> of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> Publi&s;hed
his Ob&s;ervations made in <HI>Greenland</HI> in the <HI>High
Dutch,</HI> a Language little under&s;tood in <HI>England.</HI>
His Voyage being the la&s;t and be&s;t was much de&s;ired
here, it being full of <HI>Draughts</HI> and curious <HI>Remarks;</HI>
the Copying and Tran&s;lating of which, are perform'd

<P>The&s;e four make up the <HI>Volume,</HI> together with

as al&s;o upon &s;ome Northern <HI>I&s;lands, North-Ea&s;t,</HI>

Part of him, <HI>viz. The Encouraging and Reward|ing

which &s;ome <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> think not fit to practi&s;e, or per|haps
may be in&s;en&s;ible of, for want of penetration.
This makes a great Figure in the pre&s;ent and future
Ages, covers many Spots and Deformities, and &s;e|cures
the be&s;t <HI>Heads,</HI> and <HI>Hands</HI> to carry on, and

this day in the forenoon I cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tropick</HI> of

God for it: many of my men that had
been with me in the <HI>Indies</HI> formerly, were let
blood; for I take bleeding in the&s;e hot Climates
to be a great pre&s;erver of health, diverting Ca|lentures;
I experienc'd it in two Voyages before
to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and in one to the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> where &s;everal of my men under
that di&s;temper, were pre&s;erved by bleeding; in all
the&s;e Voyages I was never &s;ick one day, nor in
two years time in the Mediterranean Sea, nor at

a bow's &s;hot from the Sea in the low flat
Land; fre&s;h water is very &s;carce here: I went a|&s;hore
pre&s;ently after I had anchored, and found a
heap of Salt of about 20 Tuns; I got aboard a|gain
immediately, and &s;ent the Long-boat a&s;hore,
which brought off 2 Tuns and &frac12;, the Suff came in
&s;o much that no more could be got off; we halled
the Seyne here, and caught abundance of good
Mullets, with &s;ome <HI>Cavalle</HI> and &s;ilver Fi&s;h; one of
the I&s;landers a <HI>Negro</HI> came aboard, whom I &s;ent

good meat at 6 pieces of Eight a Cow, giving the

in pickle four Hours, then dried them to keep,

rough Ground, the Ea&s;t Point bore Ea&s;t of me,
and the We&s;t Point about We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, about
half a mile off; I could not go into the be&s;t of the
Road, the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Fleet of about thirty &s;ix Sail
riding in it; the Great <HI>Padre Eternel</HI> Admiral,
bound for <HI>Brazil,</HI> is a very great Ship and well
built, they &s;ay &s;he is in Burthen 1700 Tuns, &s;he

&s;he had but eighty, and poorly mann'd with Sea|men,
and &s;o were all the re&s;t, &s;ix Frigats might
have taken mo&s;t of the Fleet. At my coming in
to Anchor, the Admiral &s;aluted me with &s;even
Guns, I thanked him with as many; Captain <HI>Fran|cis
Wilk&s;heir</HI> in the <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> fired five, I returned
<PB N="7" REF="25">
him three; &s;o did the Reer-Admiral, and I re|turn'd
the Complement in the like number, &s;everal
of the Fleet fired three, whom I an&s;wer'd in con|clu&s;ion
with three for all. I rode on the broad
&s;ide of the Admiral, and &s;aluted the Fort with five
Guns, which return'd three, then I &s;ent my Lieu|tenant
a&s;hore to ask leave of the Governour to wa|ter,
which he granted forthwith; my Coopers, got
the Cask ready, and this Evening put one boat's

<P>Sunday <HI>Octobor</HI> 31. fair Weather, the wind at
North-ea&s;t a fine gale. This Morning <HI>Don Carolus</HI>
went a&s;hore to <HI>Pryam;</HI> with much ado I got off a
boats lading of Water, for the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> boats
were filling too, and a great many Soldiers at the
watering place &s;natch'd &s;ome of our mens Hats
off, and run away, wherefore I would not let my
men go any more this day for fear of quarreling.
This Bay of <HI>Port Praya,</HI> as they call it, is no Port,
but a fine round Bay, having high &s;teep Cliffs on
the Ea&s;t &s;ide, and in the bottom a &s;teep Hill, where
the Ca&s;tle is, that hath but four Guns, and is of
no force; there is a &s;mall Fort on the top of a Hill
on the Ea&s;t side, which hath three Guns. On the
North-we&s;t part of the Bay the &s;hore is gravelly
and &s;andy, and there's a Grove of Coco-nut trees:
A fre&s;h water Rivulet runs down into the Valley,
and thence through the Sand &s;oaks into the Sea:
this Water is in great quantity, very good, and
keeps well at Sea: to the we&s;t part of this Bay lies
a &s;mall I&s;land clo&s;e on the &s;hore, which has Gra&s;s
on it that may be cut off for Cattle, which I did;
this Road is no &s;afeguard for Shipping, for a Man
<PB N="8" REF="26">
of War may take any Ship out of the Bay, without
receiving any damage from the Forts a&s;hore, and
with Fire-Ships a whole Fleet may be &s;poiled at
plea&s;ure; for it's a fre&s;h gale every day, and there's
but two points of Land by which a man may fetch
into any part of the Bay; al&s;o the Bay lies
open to the Sea from the Ea&s;t, Southerly to the
<HI>W. S. W.</HI> I called for my Lieutenants and Ma&s;ter,
and acquainted them, that I had Orders to &s;ail
from thence to the Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> to the South|ward
of the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> to the &s;treights of
<HI>Magellan,</HI> through which we were to pa&s;s into the
South Seas, and that we mu&s;t &s;hape our Cour&s;e to
make the &s;horte&s;t way of it, and be careful to keep
Ea&s;terly enough of it, to weather the &s;hoals of
<HI>Brazil,</HI> called the <HI>Abroholls,</HI> lying in and about
eighteen degrees of Southerly Latitude, for the
Wind blows for the mo&s;t part thereabouts between
the Latitude of ten South, and the Latitude of
twenty South, at Ea&s;t by South, and Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t
fre&s;h gales; whil&s;t this pa&s;s'd, in came the Ma|&s;ter,
and told me all things were &s;towed, and the
Wind at <HI>E.</HI> b. <HI>N.</HI> fre&s;h; I concluded with him that
our be&s;t Cour&s;e at pre&s;ent would be South and by
Ea&s;t, and as we got Southerly and the Wind grew
large, we might alter our Cour&s;e when we would:
we &s;teered a Point or two from the Wind, that
the Ship might have fre&s;h way through the Sea. I
ordered my Ma&s;ter to &s;teer South and by Ea&s;t
by the Compa&s;s, and my Lieutenant to call all
hands to Prayer, read Service, and beg'd of God
Almighty a pro&s;perous Voyage, continuance in

In&s;tructions, before the Coa&s;t to be di&s;cover'd,

told me I might do what I would, for he did not
under&s;tand the Coa&s;t, nor where 'twas inhabited;
'twas his whole Di&s;cour&s;e in the Voyage, that
he had been here in a Galley, and knew all the

all I can fancy of him is, that he may
have liv'd with a We&s;t-<HI>Indian</HI> Governour, whom
he has heard talk of the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 8. at 7 a Clock this Afternoon the
Wind came to the We&s;t South-we&s;t, a &s;tiff gale. I
&s;tood to the Southward; much Rock-weed pa&s;s'd
by the Ship to day, and &s;everal Sea-Fowls &s;een;
very cold for the Sea&s;on, being Summer, which
<HI>Don Carolus</HI> began to complain of, and told me,
he did not think we &s;hould have come &s;o far
Southerly; I &s;hew'd him by my Plates how
far we were to go through the <HI>Streights,</HI> and a|long
the We&s;t Coa&s;t; he &s;aid, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went

could not do.</P>
<P>My Company are all in good health, but &s;ome
of a puny Race grow weak in being &s;o long on

which is very good to prevent the Scurvy in their
Mouths; al&s;o I order'd every Man to wa&s;h his
Mouth, Face and Hands before the receive his
daily Allowance of Bread, and appointed one
Man to &s;ee it performed; if any neglected it, the
Steward kept their Allowance for one day; like|wise
every Man is commanded to keep him&s;elf
clean, and free from Lice, upon forfeiture of his dai|ly
Allowance to the Party accu&s;ing him; by the&s;e

We&s;t-north-we&s;t, a fre&s;h gale. I &s;ent Men up to
the Top-ma&s;t-head to look abroad; this Morn|ing
no &s;ight of the Pink; I judge &s;he mu&s;t be in
<HI>Port De&s;ier:</HI> I weighed about 8 a Clock this
Morning, and &s;tood to the Northward with my
Ship; I went in my Pinnace along the &s;hore to the
Northward, whil&s;t the Ship &s;ail'd in the Offing,
about two Leagues from the &s;hore: the Shore|&s;ide
is in Beaches and &s;catter'd Rocks; in many
places the Tide of Flood was with us: at the
North-end of <HI>Seals Bay,</HI> lies a &s;mall rocky I&s;land
copling up like a Haycock. It is cover'd with
grey-colour'd Fowls Dung; a very &s;trong Tide
runs here, between the I&s;land and the Main, 'tis
a little more than a Cables length from the Point
of the Main; there's a great many broken Rocks
about it by the Sea-&s;ide; here the main Land is
low and &s;andy, up the Country in large Downs
and Hills; without Wood or fre&s;h Water any
where: On this I&s;land are abundance of Seals, and
Sea Fowls; we gave it the name of <HI>Tomahauke</HI> I|&s;land,
from an <HI>Indian</HI> Club lo&s;t here, called by the
<HI>Caribbe-Indians</HI> at <HI>Surinam</HI> a <HI>Temahauke,</HI> 'tis all a
craggy Rock, a little bigger than <HI>Seal-I&s;land,</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="34">
is eight Leagues to the North-north-ea&s;t: di&s;tant
from it to the Northwe&s;t of this I&s;land, is a deep
rounding Bay, called in the Charts <HI>Spiring's Bay,</HI>
wherein lie three &s;mall I&s;lands of an indifferent
height: the Land, in the Country over this Bay
is large high Hills, Rocks lie in the North part
of the Bay; I cro&s;s'd it in the Pinnace, amd &s;ound|ed
as I went over, and had 21 Fathom, rough
ground in the mid-way: 'tis &s;even Miles broad,
and near 3 Leagues deep; it rounds with a turning
up to the North-northwe&s;t ward, behind a Point
farther than I &s;aw; upon which rounding Point
&s;tand black Rocks, which make like a ragged
Building, and a Tower in it: at my coming in
with the Land, I &s;ail'd clo&s;e under this &s;hoar with
my Boat; the &s;hore is &s;teep, black Rocks, and
low Bays, with Pebble-&s;tones and &s;andy Beaches;
green Gra&s;s on the Hills, no Wood nor fre&s;h Wa|ter
to be &s;een; at the North-ea&s;t Point of this
<HI>Spiring's-Bay,</HI> the Land makes out full like a fore|land;
a fair high Land in large plain Hills, with
&s;andy &s;mall Bays; at the face of this Foreland
lie &s;ix rocky I&s;lands; one is a Musket-&s;hot off the
Main, the re&s;t farther off; the outwardmo&s;t is the
bigge&s;t, a Mile from the Point of the Main, and
is called <HI>Penguin-I&s;land;</HI> it is indifferent high at
the ends and low in the middle; 'tis near three
quarters of a Mile long, North-north-ea&s;t and
South-&s;outh-we&s;t, and near half a Mile broad Ea&s;t
and We&s;t; it is all craggy Rocks, except in the
lowe&s;t part of the middle, which is gravelly, and in
the Summer time had a little green Gra&s;s; the great
black Gannets lay their Eggs here, and the Pen|guins,
<PB N="25" REF="34">
all over the I&s;land upon and under the
Rocks in Holes; Seals lie all about the &s;ides, on
the tops of the highe&s;t Rocks and in the middle
of it; the number of Seals, Penguins, and Sea-Fowl
upon the&s;e I&s;lands, is al&s;most incredible to
them that never &s;aw them; for the multitude of
each Creature that's there daily, is numberle&s;s
the Six I&s;lands are full of Seals, but the Penguins
frequent the bigge&s;t mo&s;t; I put a-&s;hore at one of
them, and took into my Boat three hundred Pen|guins,
in le&s;s than half an hour, and could have
taken three thou&s;and in the time, if my Boat
would have carried 'em, for 'tis but driving 'em
in flocks to the &s;hore, by the Boats &s;ide, where
two or three Men knock them on the head with
&s;hort Truncheons, and the re&s;t heave them into
the Boat; the Seals will run over a Man, if he does
not avoid 'em; mean time the Ship was &s;tanding
to the Northward; about 2 Leagues off many
broken Rocks and foul ground lie among the&s;e
I&s;lands, and without the Point of the outermo&s;t it
makes a great ripling, which is the &s;trength of
the Tide, rever&s;ed from the I&s;lands agin&s;t the o|ther
Tide; to the Northward of the&s;e I&s;lands is
a Bay, four Leagues long, and a League and half
deep; in the Northwe&s;t thereof lies the Harbour of
<HI>Port De&s;ier,</HI> which we could &s;ee from <HI>Penguin I&s;land's</HI>
bearing North-north-we&s;t from <HI>Penguin I&s;land,</HI> di|&s;tant
about 3 Leagues: about the middle of this
Bay are &s;teep white Cliffs, near two miles long;
the upper part of the Cliff has black &s;treaks
down a fourth part, cau&s;ed by the Water drain|ing
down on it; the Land is plain on the top of
<PB N="26" REF="35">
the&s;e Cliffs but further into the Country high
rounding Hills and Downs, and toward the Wa|ter-&s;ide
low; on the South part of the Bay are
craggy Rocks on the Main like great Walls; near
the Sea there's a &s;andy Cove, to hale a Boat
up in foul Weather; the Cove is ju&s;t under the&s;e
wall-like Rocks.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>Feb.</HI> 26. Fair Weather, the Wind at
We&s;t, a &s;tiff gale. I kept a Light out all Night,
that the Pink might &s;ee if &s;he came along; the
fir&s;t part of the Night a great Fire was made on
the &s;hore for the &s;ame purpo&s;e: Cold weather:
this Morning at 7 a Clock I manned both my
Boats, and into the Herbour; the Ship rode
moored at the Harbour-mouth, within the Mu&s;cle-bank,
in &s;ix Fathom at low Water; I &s;ent my Men
upon the Hills on the North &s;hore to look a|broad
for the Pink, and make a Fire in the dry
Gra&s;s, that &s;he might &s;ee the &s;moak if &s;he were
thereabouts, but they could not &s;ee her; I &s;ound|ed
the Harbour in many places to day at low Wa|ter,
and found it a very good one for great Ships
to ride in, provided they have good Cables and
Anchros; I &s;earched the &s;hore, but found no
Wood, and very little fre&s;h Water; on the hilly
and large Downs, very few Bu&s;hes, but dry; long
Gra&s;s growing in tufts and knots; the Soil is
gravelly and dry, in &s;ome Valleys well mixt with
black mould; no People, fire or &s;moak but our
own to be &s;een; I &s;aw &s;everal places where they
had lain, behind Bu&s;hes upon Gra&s;s, which they
had plucked up, and that they had made &s;mall
&s;ires, and roa&s;ted Lumpets and Mu&s;cles; there
<PB N="27" REF="35">
lay Wooll, Feathers, bones of Bea&s;ts, and &s;hivers
of Flints; I went to a Flag which I left on a Hill
ye&s;terday with Beads at it, but finding no body
had been at it, let it &s;tand; no Bea&s;ts &s;een any
where, except two Hares running over the Hills:
this day we were taken up with viewing the Har|bour,
&s;o that we did not advance above a mile and a
half into the Land: in the Valleys between the
Rocks grows abundance of wild Pea&s;e, which had
green leaves and blewi&s;h blo&s;&s;oms, both ta&s;ting like
green Pea&s;e-leaves in <HI>England,</HI> growing on vines and
tangled together; al&s;o very &s;weet &s;melling Herbs
much like Tares, very green, and white and yel|low
Flowers, likewi&s;e green Herbs much like Sage,
but grow in knots near the ground like Lettice;
the&s;e Herbs with the Pea&s;e-leaves, made a good
Sallad to refre&s;h &s;uch as were inclining to the
Scurvy; for want of which fre&s;h Trade &s;everal of
my Men were falling into it. Here are abundance
of very good Mu&s;cles, and Limpets on theRocks,
and an I&s;land frequented by many Seals, and
Fowls; in the River were pied Divers as big as
Ducks, &s;ome of them grey and black &s;hags; Ducks
and other Sea-Fowls breed on them among&s;t the
Rocks and Bu&s;hes: to day I went upon one of
the&s;e I&s;lands, and caught as many young black
Shags in their Ne&s;ts as loaded the Pinnace: when
I have di&s;covered better the particulars of the
Fowls and other things &s;een here, I will mention
them hereafter: Night coming on, and it begin|ning
to blow hard, I went aboard with Herbs,
Fowls, and what el&s;e I had got to day; and di|vided
all things equally among the Company, the
<PB N="28" REF="36">
Boys Dividend being as large as my own, or any
Man's; it blew very hard this Evening, and look|ed
very black in the South-we&s;t, an ordinary gale;
I kept a Light out all Night in the Poop for the
Pink: this day all the Company eat of young
Seals, and Penguins, and commended them for
good Food; I judged this a very fit Harbour to
fit the Ship in, for the main Ma&s;t mu&s;t be un|rig'd,
and a new gang of &s;hrouds fitted, and Bal|la&s;t
be had; and it might be a means to fall in
with the Pink, for from the tops of the Hills
we could &s;ee a great way into the Sea, &s;o that if
&s;he &s;hould come near the Coa&s;t, we could not
mi&s;s her.</P>
<P>We found 2 Springs of fre&s;h Water, one in a
Valley clo&s;e by the Water-&s;ide, in a gully above
the Ship, half a mile up the River; the other up
a Valley between the Rocks, ju&s;t a-bre&s;t where
the Ship rode, about half a mile from the River's
&s;ide, right from <HI>Coopers-Bay</HI> in the &s;ame Valley;
the&s;e Springs are but &s;mall, and the Water's a little
bracki&s;h or &s;alti&s;h, for in the dry Valleys the
Earth is naturally &s;alti&s;h; the Ground and Rocks
have a white Rhime of Salt-petre hanging on them;
I went into the Land 2 miles North-we&s;t, and
&s;aw the Country hilly, and dry Land without
Wood or Water; &s;ome craggy Rocks and Valleys
low, but dry and of a Salt-petre nature; here and
there &s;ome Bu&s;hes with prickly Branches, and

velly and &s;andy generally, with tufts of dry fear|ed
Gra&s;s growing on it; I digged in &s;everal places
but &s;aw nothing but gravelly Sand and Rocks;
no &s;ort of Metals or Minerals; I looked al&s;o among
the broken Rocks for Metals, but &s;aw no
&s;ign of any; from the tops of the Hills I could
&s;ee a great way into the Land, which is all
Hills and Downs like <HI>Cornwall:</HI> toil&s;om travelling
to tho&s;e that were not u&s;ed to it; I could travel
as far in an hour as many of my Men could in
two; to day we &s;aw nine Bea&s;ts feeding on the
Gra&s;s, very like Deer, but larger, and had longer
Necks, but no Horns; reddi&s;h coloured on the
Back and aloft, whiti&s;h under their Bellies and up
their Flanks; when we had got within a Fur|long
of them they fell a neighing like Hor&s;es, one
an&s;wered another, and then all run away.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day <HI>March 1.</HI> Fair Weather this Morning,
Wind at North, a fine gale and a cold Air. This
Forenoon I filled the Casks out of the Spring, and
dug them deeper; I &s;et up a long Pole with a
white Cloath upon it, on a Hill near a mile into
the Land, where 'twas mo&s;t likely to be &s;een by
the Inhabitants; with it I left Beads, a Looking-gla&s;s,
a Knife, a Hook and an Hatchet, to invite
the People of the Country to &s;hew them&s;elves, for
I was willing to &s;ee 'em, that I might di&s;cover
what they had; but through I went about the
Hills this Afternoon, I could &s;ee neither People,
Fire, nor Smoak. I &s;aw three O&s;triches, but could
not get near enough to make a &s;hot at them; they
were feeding on Gra&s;s, and at fir&s;t &s;ight of me ran
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">way; I had a Greyhound with me, which I turn'd
<PB N="30" REF="37">
loo&s;e upon 'em, who gave Cha&s;e to one of them,
and at la&s;t gave her a turn, which &s;he recovered,
took to the Hills, and &s;o e&s;caped; they are grey
coloured, and larger than a great Turky-cock in
<HI>England;</HI> they can't fly, but have long Legs, and
tru&s;t to their running: I &s;aw two handfuls of
Wooll among the Gra&s;s, where the Natives had
made a Fire; it was the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> red Wooll, which
they bring out of <HI>India,</HI> and very fine; I brought
it away with me, and &s;et the Greyhound at 3 of
the large Bea&s;ts like Deer, but they were too &s;wift
for him: Night coming on I returned on Board; at
7 a Clock this Night the Wind came to the North,
a fre&s;h gale, and ha&s;ey Weather; no &s;ight of

to the South-Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>March 4.</HI> Fair Weather this Morning,
the Wind at Ea&s;t, a fine gale, I went a&s;hore and
filled fre&s;h Water, the re&s;t of the Seamen fitted rig|ging;
this day at 12 a Clock I went with both the
Boats, and forty Men to <HI>Seal-I&s;land,</HI> into the Har|bour,
every Man with his Staff and Club; we
landed, drove the Seals up together, be&s;et them
round, and in half an hours time killed four hun|dred
young and old; &s;triking them on the head
kills them pre&s;ently; as &s;oon as they were knock|ed
down we cut their throats, that they might
bleed well whil&s;t they were hot; then loading both
the Boats with them, I carried them to the Bay
where the Tent was, landed, and laid them upon
the Rocks; to Night the Boat fetch'd them all off:

a Lion in their &s;haggy Necks, Heads, and
Faces, as well as in their Roar; the Females are
like Lione&s;&s;es before, only they are hairy all over
like a Hor&s;e, and &s;mooth, and the Male is &s;mooth
all over his hind-parts; their &s;hape is very deform|ed,
for their hind-part tapers till it come to a
point, where grow two Fins or Feet, two more
grow out of their Brea&s;t, &s;o that they can go on
Land a great pace, and climb Rocks, and Hills of
a good height; they delight much to lie and &s;leep
a&s;hore; &s;ome are very large, upwards of eigh|teen
Foot in length, and thicker about than a But
in the Bilge, and exce&s;&s;ive fat; there are thou&s;ands
fourteen foot long, the common &s;ort are about
five foot and all very fat; they'l gape at you when
you come to them, as if they would devour you,
and 'tis labour enough for two Men to kill one
of the great ones with a Hand-&s;pike, which is the
be&s;t Weapon for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>March</HI> 5. Fair Weather, Wind at
South-we&s;t, a fine gale. This Morning we went a|&s;hore
to flay &s;ome Seals, and cut the Bodies in good
hand&s;om pieces, and &s;alted it up well in Bulk on
Deal-boards, a&s;hore, that the blood might drain
from it; the Meat looks as well and as white as
Lamb, and is very good Victuals now, but when
'tis a little &s;alt it will eat much better; tho&s;e we
dre&s;s'd were all young Seals, for they &s;ucked their
Dams, who as &s;oon as they come a&s;hore bleat, im|mediatly
come her young ones, and bleat about
her like Lambs, and &s;uck her; one old Female
&s;uckles four or five, and beats away other young
ones that come near, whence I believe they have
<PB N="32" REF="38">
four or five at a time; the young ones which we
killed and eat were as big as a midling Dog; we
cut the fat off of the Great ones, and made Oil of
it for the Lamps, and other u&s;es in the Ship; the
Oil of the young ones we fried, and eat with our
Provi&s;ions; it is very &s;weet and good to fry any
Food with; our Men will have it to be as good as
Olive Oil; mo&s;t of my Men to day gathered of
tho&s;e green Pea&s;e-leaves and other Herbs for Sal|lads,
which &s;ome eat raw, &s;ome boiled; it is re|fre&s;hing
to their Bodies.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>March</HI> 6. Blowing Weather, Wind at
We&s;t: This day, after Prayers, I went a&s;hore on
the South-&s;ide of the River, and travelled eight
miles into the Land, South-we&s;t and by We&s;t, ha|ving
twelve armed Men with me; my Lieute|nant
went up the River in the Boat nine or ten
miles, to &s;ee for People that way; my other Lieu|tenant
went on the North-&s;ide with ten armed
Men to &s;ee for People, and view the Land; I
found in my Travels one of tho&s;e great Bea&s;ts like
a Deer, dead and whole, the Vermin had not
touched him; all his Back had pretty long Wooll
of the colour of dried Ro&s;e-leaves, and down his
&s;ides, his Belly white Wooll; he was as big as a
&s;mall Colt, he had a long Neck, a Head like a
Sheep, &s;o was his Mouth and Ears; his Legs very
long, and Cloven-footed like a Deer, a &s;hort
bu&s;hy Tail of a reddi&s;h colour; no Horns nor e|ver
had any, it was a Male: I believe the&s;e Bea&s;ts
are <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep; (<HI>Guianacoes</HI>) I had his Paunch
opened, and &s;earched for the Bezoar-&s;tone in it&punc;
and in the Pipe to the Stomach, I turned them in|&s;ide
<PB N="33" REF="38">
outward, but found none; I had heard <HI>We&s;t-Indian
Spaniards</HI> &s;ay, that they have taken the
Bezoar-&s;tone of Guianacoes, and therefore opened
this, which I take to be the &s;ame Bea&s;t: In tra|velling
to day I &s;aw &s;everal herds of them, &s;ome|times
ten, thirty, or forty together; I could not
get near enough to &s;hoot at them; they neigh
like young Hor&s;es, and &s;o wander away: I &s;aw
nine O&s;triches, but they would not &s;uffer me to
come within &s;hot of them; I let the Greyhound
at them, but they out-run him up the Hills: we
&s;aw a Fox, a wild Dog, and five or &s;ix Hares, of
which the Greyhound killed one; they are &s;haped
like <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hares, and much larger, and in&s;tead
of a Tail have a little &s;tub about an inch long,
without Hair on it; they have holes in the ground
like Coneys: no Woods to be &s;een, only a few
Bu&s;hes like White-Thorns. The Land is dry, of a
&s;andy gravelly Soil, in large rounding Hills, not
very high, but in Downs and Valleys, bearing
nothing but Gra&s;s; here and there are gullies of
fre&s;h Water in the Valleys, which is made in the
Winter-time when the Snow di&s;&s;olves: I &s;aw &s;e|veral
places of &s;alt Water in the Land, which is
occa&s;ioned by the natural &s;altne&s;s of the Earth;
here are no Fruits nor Herbs: When I was at the
farthe&s;t, and on a Hill, I could not &s;ee any &s;ign
of People, or Woods, but &s;till Hills and Valleys
as far as we could de&s;cry; no Birds to be &s;een but
Kites, which are like tho&s;e in <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;mall
Birds like Sparrows, and Linnets; &s;ome Flies and
Humble-bees here: we &s;aw &s;ome &s;mall four-foot|ed
Animals running in the Gra&s;s; &s;peckled-Grey,
<PB N="34" REF="39">
&s;haped like a &s;mall Creature in <HI>England</HI> called an
Eft, Newt or Lizard; no Adder nor Snake, nor any
venomous Creature; Cattle would live here very
well, &s;uch as Hor&s;es, Cows, Sheep, Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Evening growing upon us, I returned to the Ship,
and 'twas within Night when we got aboard our
Boat, and ten a Clock when we entered the Ship;
I found on Board my Lieutenant that went up the
River, but they which went on the North-&s;ide
were not come back; up the River they &s;aw five
&s;mall I&s;lands, which had Sea-fowls on them and
Bu&s;hes for fewel; the River grows broader up|wards
and has &s;everal Rocks in it; on the &s;hoar
they &s;aw Guianacoes, O&s;triches, and Hares; no
People, Fire or Smoak; they &s;aw where People
had been, and Fires made, and Mu&s;cles and Lum|pets
roa&s;ted; no fre&s;h Water nor Wood, nor any
Metal or Mineral; the Land hilly with Gra&s;s on
it: At twelve a Clock to Night tho&s;e that went
on the North-&s;ide came aboard; they had been
about eight miles into the Land North-we&s;t, and
&s;aw no People, but found where People had been,
and made Fires in the Gra&s;s, and Gra&s;s laid to
fire the Bu&s;hes; al&s;o where &s;ome had lain on open
places, and &s;et little Bu&s;hes in Half-moons, to &s;hel|ter
them from the Weather; on the top of a Hill
they made a fire with Gra&s;s to &s;ee if any would
an&s;wer them; they &s;at down by it all day, but
could &s;ee none made any where el&s;e: the Land
is in rounding large Hills, not very high, but like
Downs, as the Coa&s;t of <HI>York&s;hire</HI> about <HI>Burling|ton;</HI>
no Woods nor Trees &s;een, nor fre&s;h Water;
here and there a Bu&s;h growing in a Valley; indif|ferent
<PB N="35" REF="39">
good Gra&s;s; the Soil gravelly and &s;andy,
and &s;ome ridges of Rocks; they &s;aw Guianacoes,
O&s;triches, Hares, and Kites; &s;everal little Crea|tures
like Efts; no kind of Fruit or Berry, Mi|neral
or Metal: I charged them as they travelled
in any Gullies where Water had run to &s;earch for
grains of Gold, or other Metal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Gold is
found in grains in &s;uch Gullies, and much Gold
is found in the Land on the other &s;ide, not two
hundred Leagues di&s;tant from us; much Salt-pe|ter
hangs on the Earth where Water has been, in
a kind of Flower; the pla&s;hes of Water they met
with were as &s;alt as Brine, which the Earth made.
I &s;aw Smelts here eighteen Inches long lying dead
on the Shore, but hitherto have not &s;een one
Oy&s;ter, or other &s;hell-Fi&s;h, Crawfi&s;h, Lob&s;ter, or
Crab, though 'tis po&s;&s;ible the place may have 'em
all. Whil&s;t we were &s;tanding by the Water-&s;ide,
a Seal cha&s;ed on &s;hore a Fi&s;h as large as a Mackrel
and like a Mullet; one of the Men took it up, and
dre&s;&s;ed it, when he came on Board, 'twas excel|lent
good; here mu&s;t be a great quantity of Fi&s;h to
maintain all the Seals, Penguins, and other Fowls
that live upon nothing el&s;e, and yet are all ex|tream
fat, and innumerable in multitude; be&s;ides
what Creatures we have not &s;een yet; I have
&s;een Seals in this Harbour &s;wimming with their
heads above Water, with large Fi&s;h in their
Mouths.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>March</HI> 13. Indifferent Weather, Wind
at We&s;t, a fre&s;h gale; The Air cold this Morning.
I went up the River in my Boat with fourteen
Men armed; I pa&s;t the I&s;land, where the bru&s;hy
<PB N="36" REF="40">
Bu&s;hes are, and where we took the young Shags;
there the River grows broader, near a mile from
the North &s;hore over to the South, and conti|nues
that breadth four miles, then it be|comes
narrower, and turns away to the South-we&s;t;
at this turning is an I&s;land of a mean height
and Rocky, bearing &s;ome &s;mall Bu&s;hes and Gra&s;s;
I went upon it, and &s;aw a Po&s;t of five foot long
&s;et up (it had been the timber of a Ship) with a
piece of Board about a foot &s;quare nailed to it,
at the foot of it one of my Men took up a piece
of Sheet-Lead, and gave it to me, it had this In|&s;cription
engraven on it,

In a hole of the Po&s;t lay a latten or tin Box,

the hole) with a &s;heet of written Paper enclo&s;ed
in it, but &s;o eaten by the ru&s;t of the Box, that
'twas not to be read; I cut out with my Knife up|on
a Board the Ship's Name, and the date of the
Year and Month, which I nailed to the Po&s;t; and
brought away the Lead with me, aud named the
place <HI>Le Mair's I&s;land:</HI> we found on it &s;everal pie|ces
of Boards, of the Wreck of &s;ome Ship, that
had been burned; they were drove up here by
the Tide; the People of the Country can't get
upon this I&s;land: From hence I went on the North
&s;ide of the River two miles into the Land; no
Trees to be &s;een, but many O&s;triches and Guiana|coes
in many places; the Soil is marly and good,
the Hills not very high, but plain large Downs,
with Gra&s;s on them all over; digging in two or
three places I found &s;andy dry ground near a foot
deep, then Marle: In my opinion it might be
made excellent Corn-ground, being ready to Till;
'tis very like the Land on <HI>New-market</HI> Heath; no
People to be &s;een; I &s;earched the Gullies and bro|ken
Rocks, for grains of Gold or Minerals, but
found neither: I returned to the Boat again, row|ed
farther under the &s;hore, landed, and mounted
a&s;teep high Hill to view the Country; on the top
of this rocky Hill grow &s;mall Bu&s;hes: I could &s;ee
the cour&s;e of the River a long way further, and the
Land all Gra&s;s; here and there a white &s;pot of
Marle on the &s;ide of a Hill; no People to be &s;een
nor Boats on the River; I came down to the Boat:
&s;everal Creeks run from hence a mile or two into
<PB N="38" REF="41">
the Land: I cro&s;s'd the River to the South-ea&s;t
&s;hore; we made the Boar fa&s;t in a Creek in a Val|ley,
and went all hands up the Land three miles;
we &s;aw many Guianacoes, and O&s;triches, but could
not come within &s;hot of them; I &s;aw the Foot|&s;teps
of five Men that had been upon the Oar;
I mea&s;ured my Foot with them, which was larger
and longer by half an Inch than any of them; we
could not &s;ee any People: it being near Night we
plucked up Gra&s;s, and laid it to the be&s;t advan|tage
for &s;helter; here we lay all Night, keeping
watch two by two; cold Air to Night, wind at
We&s;t.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>March</HI> 14. Fair Weather but cold. This
Morning by day-light we turn'd out, and marcht
into the Land four miles South-we&s;t and by South;
we could not find any fre&s;h Water; we made a
Fire on the Gra&s;s, but &s;aw no &s;ign of any People;
we &s;aw <HI>Guianacoes,</HI> Hares, Foxes, wild Dogs, pretty
large, and a grey Cat like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one, running
up the Hills: to day we caught an <HI>Armadillo;</HI> the
Dogs put her to ground; they have holes like Co|neys;
we &s;oon dug her out, 'twas as big as a great
Hedg-hog, and not much unlike one; the <HI>Arma|dillo</HI>
is ca&s;ed over the Body with a &s;hell,&s;hutting
one under another like &s;hells of Armour; the
Dogs couls not hurt her: we &s;aw Rats in many
places, and a kind of Polecat, with two white
&s;treaks on the Back, all the re&s;t black; our Dogs
killed two of them; they &s;tink much, &s;everal O|&s;triches,
&s;ome Partridges and many Kites: the
Land in fair Hills without Wood or fre&s;h Water;
the Soil a &s;andy Gravel with Gra&s;s all over it; no

Mineral or Metal &s;een. This afternoon we return|ed
to our Boat, and went through a Creek two
miles long, which is dry at low Water, and
not more than thirty foot broad; it makes a fair
I&s;land of a mean heighth, plain on the top, and
Gra&s;s growing all over it, but no Wood nor Wa|ter
upon it; the greate&s;t part of it is a &s;andy marly
Soil; 'tis two miles long, and half a mile broad;
the Greyhound killed two Hares on it pre&s;ently,
and we &s;aw above twenty; I called it <HI>Hare-I&s;land;</HI>
it is adjacent to the South-&s;hore; eight miles up
the River from the narrow, I went down the River

Canoas or other Boats here.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 24. Blowing Weather, Wind at We&s;t.
We fetch'd all our things off the &s;hore, and got the
Ship ready to Sail; I went a-&s;hore on the South-&s;ide
to the peeked Rock, and found it a natural
Rock, &s;tanding on a &s;mall round Hill, as if it had
been built there by Man; it hath a Cleft on the
top it as big in circumference as a But: 'tis near
forty foot high above the Hill it &s;tands on; about
it lie little lumps of Rocks; I &s;aw nothing el&s;e
worth notice, &s;o I return'd to the Ship; the big|ge&s;t
&s;tick growing in or near this Harbour, or in
the Countries as far as we went, which was twenty
Miles, would not make a Helve for a Hatchet, but
there are Bu&s;hes which will &s;erve for firing at Sea:

thought 'twould be dangerous being a lone Ship,
a &s;tormy Sea to &s;ail in, and unknown Coa&s;ts to
&s;earch out, and if we &s;hould happen to run a|ground
any where, could expect no relief; the&s;e
&s;u&s;picions I &s;oon put out of their Heads, by telling
them of the great Riches of the Land, and that
<HI>Captain Drake</HI> went round the World in one Ship,
when in tho&s;e days there were but ordinary Na|vigators;
and was it for us to que&s;tion our good
fortune, who beyond Compari&s;on are better Sea|men,
if we would put our &s;elves in Action; and
for me, I would expo&s;e no Man to more danger
than my &s;elf in the Attempt. Calm to Night; I
rode fa&s;t, a &s;mall Tide running where I rode; the
Water ebb'd near three fathom perpendicular: it
is near nine Leagues from the <HI>Flat I&s;land</HI> to <HI>Saint
Julian,</HI> South-&s;outh-we&s;t and North-north-ea&s;t as

<P>Wedne&s;day
, <HI>April</HI> 13. Fair Weather, Wind at
We&s;t, a &s;mall gale. Fro&s;ty and cold Air, no &s;ign
of the Pink: I went a&s;hore and haled the Seyne
on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide; at the fir&s;t of the Flood we
caught five hundred Fi&s;hes, as big as large Mul|lets,
and much like them, grey, and full of Scales:
&s;ome as big as a Man's Leg; we caught them all
in four hours time, returned aboard, and divided
them among the whole Ship's Company; they eat
admirably well; many good Mu&s;cles lie on the
Rocks, and Oy&s;ter-&s;hells on the Shore-&s;ide, and
growing in Veins on the Rocks, but no Meat in
them: Wind at We&s;t to Night, a fre&s;h gale.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>April</HI> 18. Wind at South-we&s;t, a &s;tiff
gale. Cold Air and &s;ome Snow this Morning; the
Winter is come &s;trong and &s;tormy, &s;o that 'twill
be impo&s;&s;ible to hold the Coa&s;t into the Streights;
for the Wind blows altogether from the We&s;t or
We&s;t-&s;outherly, and in &s;uch Gu&s;ts as will force a
Ship off the Coa&s;t. This day I ordered my Pur&s;er
to &s;erve the Company Brandy-wine for their Al|lowance,
at a Quart <HI>per</HI> Week a Man: I got a
Boats lading of the Wood of the Country aboard
for firing; to Night it blew hard at South-we&s;t;
all the Company eat &s;alt Seal, and Penguins for
their Allowance: &s;weet and very good Meat, and
keeps well and long in Salt.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44">
Friday <HI>April</HI> 22. Wind at South-we&s;t, a &s;tiff
gale, and cold Air. This Morning I went a&s;hore on
the North-we&s;t &s;ide with twenty Men to the Salt-pond,
which is ru&s;ted all over like a Pavement,
with very white and good Salt, two Inches thick,
for two miles long: in <HI>February</HI> here's Salt e|nough
to fill a thou&s;and Ships; we filled two Bags
and laid up near two Tuns out of the Water, for
there was Water over the Salt, which began to
decay with the Rain and Weather beating on it:
at Night I returned aboard, we brought as much
Salt with us as filled a Punchion, very good white
Stone-&s;alt, whiter than <HI>French</HI>-Salt, and of a very
plea&s;ant &s;mell; I &s;aw &s;ome Guianacoes, and O&s;tri|ches:
the Hills and Valleys dry Earth, and Gra&s;s
on them: on the higher Hills lies Snow, no Peo|ple,
but many places where they had made fires,
and lain under a Bu&s;h for &s;helter; no Mineral or
Metal, Tree, or Fruit.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 27. Clo&s;e Weather, and little
Wind; a cold Air, it freezes hard, the Ice bears a
Man.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day <HI>April</HI> 28. Wind at We&s;t and by
South, a fine gale, cold fro&s;ty Weather. We un|rig'd
the Ship, and made all &s;nug, intending to
Winter in this Harbour; the Ice will not &s;uffer us
to pa&s;s the Streights; the Winds are &s;o &s;tormy, and
generally out of the We&s;tern quarter; the Nights
&s;o long and cold, that the pa&s;&s;age is impossible
this Winter. The Port I found &s;afe to ride in, and
good refre&s;hment to be had of Fowls: as Ducks,
Peekes, and Divers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Spring I may be
ready to &s;ail to the Southward, when we &s;hall
<PB N="46" REF="45">
have the year before us, and the Sun in the Sou|thern
Signs, which will give long Days and &s;hort
Nights, and temperate Weather; Wind at North-north-ea&s;t
this Evening, and Rain: it blew a great
&s;torm to Night, the Boat &s;unk at the Ship's &s;tern,
and lo&s;t the Oars: le&s;s Wind towards Night, and
veared to the We&s;t.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>May</HI> 6. Wind at We&s;t-north-we&s;t, a fine
gale. I went a-&s;hore on the North-we&s;t &s;ide with
thirty Men, and travelled &s;even or eight miles up
the Hill, &s;aw no People: the Land is great Gra&s;s-Downs
in mo&s;t places; and on the tops of the
Hills, and in the Ground are very large Oy&s;ter-&s;hells
they lie in Veins in the Earth, and in the firm
Rocks: and on the &s;ides of Hills in the Country;
they are the bigge&s;t Oy&s;ter-&s;hells that ever I &s;aw;
&s;ome &s;ix, &s;ome &s;even Inches broad, yet not one
Oy&s;ter to be found in the Harbour; whence I con|clude,
they were here when the Earth was form|ed;
no &s;ign of Mine or Metal, no Woods or Tree;
We found a good Spring of fre&s;h Water up in the
Hills, it drains into &s;alt Water-&s;wa&s;hes: We &s;aw
&s;everal Salt-water Ponds &s;ix miles in the Land,
made by the &s;altne&s;s of the Earth; we &s;aw O&s;tri|ches,
Guianacoes, and a Fox. I made a Fire on the
top of the highe&s;t Hill, but could &s;ee no an&s;wer;
I returned aboard with my Company very weary;
&s;ome of my Men fetched Salt to day: fair Wea|ther
to Night.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>May</HI> 13. Indifferent Weather, Wind at
We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, a fine gale. This day we fetch|ed
Salt: a Gentleman of my Company, Mr. <HI>John
Wood,</HI> walking on the <HI>I&s;land of Ju&s;ice,</HI> found three
<PB N="47" REF="45">
&s;mall pieces of Gold Wire in two Mu&s;cle-&s;hells:
which Shells were made together by a green Gut|&s;tring:
the Gold was to the value of two &s;hillings
Engli&s;h, and had been hammered, the wire as big
as a great Pin.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>June</HI> 6. Cloudy cold Weather, Wind at
South-we&s;t, a fre&s;h gale. This day I went a-&s;hore
with &s;ixteen Men, and travelled ten miles We&s;t
into the Land; the Hills there are covered with
Snow: 'tis very cold, we could not go any fur|ther
for Snow; and the Air is &s;o cold that we
could not endure to lie on the ground; on the
Hill that I was on, we could &s;ee nothing but Hill
beyond Hill; no Woods, nor Trees, nor Bu&s;hes,
all gra&s;s Downs: the Land is flat on the tops of
the Hills; fre&s;h Water runs down in &s;everal places,
which is melted Snow, and when the Water leaves
running, there's no Snow. I &s;aw many Guiana|coes,
and O&s;triches; no People or &s;ign of any:
clo&s;e by the Water-&s;ide we &s;aw many places, where
they had lain on open Hills in the Snow, and &s;ome
places where they had killed and eat Guianacoes
and O&s;triches; they make but &s;mall Fires with
little &s;ticks; I do not find they roa&s;t their fle&s;h at
them, for we &s;aw &s;ome raw Fle&s;h hanging to the
Bones, which they had gnawed with their Teeth:
their Fires are only to warm their Children's Fin|gers,
as we imagine: I gathered &s;ome handfuls of
Guianacoes Wool that lay here; I am per&s;uaded
the&s;e People mu&s;t needs &s;ee us travelling to and
fro every day, but won't come near or be &s;een by
us: they live like wild Bea&s;ts, or rather wor&s;e, for
&s;ometimes they mu&s;t be in great want of Food;
<PB N="48" REF="46">
here's neither Fruit, Root, or Herb for it: The
Land is a dry gravelly Soil, with Sand, and in
many places a Marle two foot below the Surface;
the Gra&s;s, which is dry, grows in knots, not very
long but thick; in the Valleys the Earth is of a
Petery or nitrous Nature; O&s;triches &s;een; no &s;ign
of Metal or Mineral; I and my Company have
looked in mo&s;t places where we travelled for it:
to Night we got down but very weary.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day <HI>June</HI> 7. cl&s;e dark Weather, Wind
at North-ea&s;t and by Ea&s;t, a fair gale: a new
Moon to day, fine Weather to Night, but
cold; the Stars near the <HI>Pole Antartick</HI> are
very vi&s;ible; &s;ome of the &s;mall Stars in the Con|&s;tellation
of little <HI>Hydra</HI> are near the <HI>Pole;</HI> Here
are many good Stars near the Pole, good for Ob|&s;ervation,

Stars in <HI>Tucan's bill,</HI> and the Stars in <HI>Tucan's thigh
and back;</HI> the stars in <HI>Grus's head and wing and
body;</HI> but the brighte&s;t Stars are the Stars in the
former foot of <HI>Centaurus</HI> and the <HI>Cro&s;iers;</HI> the o|ther
Stars are of the third, fourth and fifth Mag|nitude:
The two Clouds are &s;een very plainly,
and a &s;mall black Cloud, which the foot of the
<HI>Cro&s;s</HI> is in, is always very vi&s;ible when the Cro&s;iers
are above the Horizon, as they are alway here
in the&s;e Latitudes. The Heavens in this South
Hemi&s;phere are as the Heavens in the North He|mi&s;phere;
but no Stars within eighteen degrees
of the Pole fit for Ob&s;ervation; no Pole-&s;tar, as
the Star in the Tail of the little <HI>Bear</HI> is in the
<PB N="49" REF="46">
North: the Air cold to Night, but very healthy
for &s;tirring Men; I have not had my Finger ached
as yet; a Man hath an excellent &s;tomach here; I
can eat Foxes and Kites as &s;avourily as if it were
Mutton; every Fox and Kite as we kill, we eat,
which is ever now and then one killed. Nothing
comes ami&s;s to our &s;tomachs, not one Man com|plains
of cold in his Head or of Coughs. Young
Men well grown and of good &s;hape are mo&s;t fit
for this Country, it being a dry and an hungry
Air, and Provi&s;ions to be got with pains. The
O&s;triches are nothing &s;o big as the O&s;triches in
<HI>Barbary,</HI> nor of the Colour nor Feather; the&s;e are
grey on the Back, and &s;haggy Feathers of no u&s;e,
and the Feathers on their Bellies are whire; they
have long Legs and &s;mall Wings; they cannot
fly; they have a long Neck, and a &s;mall Head,
and beaked near like a Goo&s;e; they are much like
a great Turky-cock, and good lean dry Meat and
&s;weet: to Night I came aboard; it blew fre&s;h at
we&s;t.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day <HI>June</HI> 22. Wind at We&s;t-north-we&s;t,
a &s;tout gale. This day I went a&s;hore on
the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, &s;aw no People; this day Mr. <HI>John
Wood</HI> went a&s;hore on the We&s;t &s;ide, and three Men
with him; they were armed; they travelled into
the Land We&s;t and by North about four miles;
where they &s;aw &s;even People of the Country on
a Hill, making a noi&s;e and wafting them to the
Ship: Our Men went up the ri&s;e of the Hill to
them; three of the <HI>Indian</HI> Men came to Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>
with their Bows and Arrows in their Hands, and
a loo&s;e skin about their Bodies, and a Furr-skin
<PB N="50" REF="47">
about their Heads, and pieces of skins about their
Feet, and all the other parts of their bodies na|ked;
they were painted red and white on their
Faces; they would not come &s;o near as to let our
Men touch them, but &s;lepped back as you mo|ved
forward; they continuing their noi&s;e, and
wafting with their Hands towards the Ship, and
and kept talking, but no Man could under&s;tand
them: they repeated <HI>Oz&s;e, Oz&s;e,</HI> very often; they
have an har&s;h Speech and &s;peak in the Throat;
they received any thing that you ca&s;t to them on
the ground. Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> gave them a Knife, and a
Sha&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">, and a Neckcloath, and a bottle of Brandy:
they would not drink; Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> could not per|ceive
any Bracelets they had, or any thing about
them &s;ave their Skin: they are people of a middle
&s;tature, and well-&s;haped; tawny Olive-colour'd,
black Hair, not very long: they &s;eem to be of a
rude behaviour, for they returned nothing for
what they received, nor took no notice of any
thing; the re&s;t of their Company &s;tayed at the
Hill: they can endure much cold, for their Legs,
Buttocks, and lower parts are naked. Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>
was taller than any of them, and he judged the eld|e&s;t
of the three to be upwards of forty years old,
the other thirty. They &s;eemed to be very fearful;
they took their own time, and went away into the
Land. Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> returned aboard and acquaint|ed
me with what he had &s;een. This Night we
&s;aw a Fire in the Hills. It blew hard to Night at
We&s;t. They have &s;mall Dogs with them; they
would not have come near our People, if they had
not fallen accidentally in the Hills and Valleys
<PB N="51" REF="47">
with them. I have thought that they have heard
of the cruel dealings of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and dare not
tru&s;t us.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>July</HI> 2. Wind at We&s;t, a fine gale. I
went a-&s;hore on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide; we killed a great
Guianacoe with the Greyhound. I looked in his
Paunch for the Bezoar-&s;tone, but found nothing.
I travelled to and fro but &s;aw no people: I &s;aw
where People had made earthen Pots, and had
gla&s;ed them, for there lay &s;ome of their &s;tuff run
together: at Night I went aboard.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>July</HI> 3. Wind at South, clo&s;e Weather.
The Guianacoe weighed, cleaved in his Quar|ters,
two hundred and fifty pounds neat. He
&s;erved all the Company for a days Fle&s;h, and is
good Meat.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day <HI>July</HI> 12. Clo&s;e Weather, and little
Wind at North and by We&s;t. I went up to the
head of the Harbour, but &s;aw no People: There
is in the Fullers-Earth Cliffs at the head of the
Harbour, a Vein made like rotten I&s;ing-gla&s;s; I
took &s;ome out, but cannot find it good for any
thing: I digged in the Cliff, but &s;aw nothing to
be taken notice of. I &s;aw in two places pieces of
floor Timbers of a Ship; they have laid a long
time rotting. We &s;aw that the bigge&s;t of the&s;e
Bu&s;hes here, have been cut down by &s;ome Chri|&s;tian
People. I &s;aw wooden Plates, and a piece of
Cork, and a piece of an old Oar: &s;ome Chri&s;tian
Ship had been here formerly. I lay a&s;hore to
Night.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>July</HI> 31. Fair Weather, Wind at South-west,
a &s;tiff gale. The Weather as cold as it is
<PB N="52" REF="48">
in <HI>England</HI> in the height of Winter, and the Air
rather &s;harper and dryer; I have now twelve Men
lame with the cold, and their Legs and Thighs
are turned as black as a black Hat, in &s;pots, the
cold having chilled the Blood; yet they u&s;e ba|thing
and &s;tuping tho&s;e places, and all that they
can to prevent it, but it rather encrea&s;eth on them
than otherwi&s;e: The&s;e are &s;uch people as I could
not make &s;tir by an meyans; they that &s;tir are as
well as any Men in the World can be.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day <HI>Augu&s;t 2.</HI> Clo&s;e Weather, Wind at
South-we&s;t, a gale and cold Air. We fall on fit|ting
of our Rigging and getting the Ship fit: Here
are hundreds of Guianacoes in companies near the
Water-&s;ide: my Greyhound is lame, &s;o that I
cannot make her run; al&s;o here are many O&s;tri|ches,
together with many green plovers at the
Watercr-&s;ide, and &s;ome Swans, but not full &s;o large
as ours: They are white, &s;ave a black Head, and
half the Neck and Legs black: Here are &s;ome
white Gee&s;e, as <HI>European</HI> gee&s;e; the brant-Gee&s;e

<P>Tue&s;day <HI>Augu&s;t 16.</HI> Clo&s;e Weather, Wind at
We&s;t and at North-we&s;t, a fine gale. I &s;ent the
Boat for Water to a Swa&s;h on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide; two
of my Men &s;aw two of the People of the Coun|try
on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide behind a Bu&s;h; my Men went
toward them; they went away and left a bundle
of Skins under the Bu&s;h; my Men made &s;igns to

<PB N="53" REF="48">
my Men brought the Bundle aboard to &s;hew
it to me, and two mungrel Dogs, which were cou|pled
together. I opened the Bundle and it was
&s;everal bags of Skins, with red Earth and white
Earth, and Soot or paint in a Bag: this is the
Trade they paint them&s;elves with; they had
Flint-&s;tones and Arrow-heads in the Bundle; I
&s;earched the Bundle all over to &s;ee grains of
Gold, but could not find any: There were Brace|lets
of Shells, and bits of Sticks, and braided
Thongs, and Arrows, and Mu&s;cle-&s;hells, and Ar|madillo-&s;hells,
and a &s;mall point of a Nail in a
&s;tick for a Bodkin: Their Skins were pieces of
Seal-skins, and pieces of Guianaco-skins, &s;ewed
together with &s;mall Guts; all very old and full
of holes, and &s;melt of grea&s;e; There were pieces
of Flints made fa&s;t with a green Gut, in the &s;plit
of a Stick, which they hold fa&s;t to knock their Ar|row-heads
into &s;hape: There were al&s;o pieces of
Sticks to get Fire with. This was all that was in
the Bundle; it was made fa&s;t with Leather-thongs,
braided round like Whip-cord, and the Dogs
were coupled with &s;uch &s;trings: The Mu&s;cle-&s;hells
are their Knives. I put all things up in the
Bag, and made it fa&s;t. Their Dogs are much of
the Race of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dogs; a good large mungrel
Cur, but very tame; any Man might handle them;
they were grey in colour, and painted red in &s;pots:
they were very lean; there were two grcat Staves
of four foot long, which was tough Cane in &s;hort
joints: I carried them a-&s;hore next day.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30. Foggy clo&s;e Weather this
morning, Wind at North. We travelled away
<PB N="54" REF="49">
We&s;t into the Land ten or twenty miles farther:
The Land all dry, with Gra&s;s, and Bu&s;hes in &s;ome
places like Thorns; the Hills high, and many,
and Snow on the tops; no Woods, nor Trees to
be &s;een; Fre&s;h-water comes running out of the
Hills in fine Rivulet; no Fruit; many &s;edgy
Bu&s;hes grow on the Brink, and brave green Gra&s;s,
and a green Herb of a pretty &s;trong hot ta&s;te;
&s;ome Teal in the Water, and Water-birds; this is
all I &s;aw about the Rivulet. Many large Ponds
in the Country, but &s;alt Water in tho&s;e Ponds;
we &s;aw Fowls like Herons, but all red; in the Val|leys
we &s;aw hundreds of Guianacoes in a compa|ny,
and twenty O&s;triches: &s;ome Heres and &s;ome
Partridges, greyer and bigger than ours; &s;ome
Snipes and &s;mall Birds; &s;everal Penne-wrens: we
&s;aw &s;everal Kites, and &s;mall Hawks, and Owls;
we caught two Armadilloes; I &s;aw two Foxes and
a wild Dog, and many brant-Gee&s;e: the Land is
in Hills and Valleys as far as we could &s;ee, and
bad travelling on foot; the Soil is gravelly and
dry sand, of a Salt-petre nature; the Gra&s;s in
&s;ome places long and dry, and in &s;ome places &s;hort
and dry; the Hills are rounding aloft like large
Downs: We red Earth in &s;ome places, &s;uch
as the <HI>Indians</HI> u&s;e; we &s;aw the Foot&s;teps of peo|ple
in many places in the Clay, and places where
they had been, and had killed Guianacoes, and
made a fire there; I gathered Guianacoes-Wooll,
and O&s;triches Feathers were &s;cattered about the
place, and Bones: there lay the Skulls of three
People, no fle&s;h on them; they were very clean,
and no larger than the Skulls of <HI>European</HI> Men;
<PB N="55" REF="49">
&s;mooth and even Teeth, clo&s;e &s;et; one of tho&s;e
Skulls was broken. Whether the&s;e people be
<HI>Man-eaters</HI> or not I cannot tell; I judge they have
Wars one with another, by rea&s;on here are &s;o
few People in this great Land, and food enough
to live on, and the Land all clear and good Pa|&s;turage
for Cattle, and no Mountains; in all the
Land there are Plains and gra&s;&s;y Meadows: here
wants only Wood to build with; it that were
here, it would be as good a Land as any part of
<HI>America,</HI> for the Counrry is very healthy. This
Afternoon it rained, and was very thick and fog|gy,
&s;o as we could not tell which way to go, al|though
we had a Compa&s;s with us; for there is
no going into the Land without one, becau&s;e a
Man will mi&s;take his way, the Country is &s;o open
in great Plains and Downs: We were very much
wet and cold; We got to Bu&s;hes, and there made
a Fire and dried our &s;elves: we &s;tayed here all
Night; we neither heard nor &s;aw any thing to
Night.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day <HI>September</HI> 1. 1670. Clo&s;e ha&s;ey Wea|ther,
the Wind at North, a &s;mall gale, &s;o as I could
not Sail this day; we tried for Fi&s;h, but caught
none, the Water is &s;o cold, I was on the Land,
when I was at the farthe&s;t, twenty five miles

all things as I &s;aw I have mentioned, excepting
&s;ome &s;mall Creatures like Efts, which run in the

have I &s;een in this Country; here are &s;ome
Earth-worms, and Caterpillers, and other Buggs,
but few in number: no wild Bea&s;t of prey, or

any other thing to annoy the Inhabitants, but
Cold and Hunger: Here lies a large Country,
open to receive any Inhabitants from forein Parts,

<P><HI>September</HI> 16. I con&s;idering my Men, being
very weak, thought it mo&s;t fit to go for <HI>Port De|&s;ier,</HI>
and there to refre&s;h the Men, for I knowing
there I could have what Penguins and Seals I
would have, which are good Provi&s;ions; al&s;o I do
intend to &s;alt up a quantity of each, to carry to
Sea with me, to lengthen out my Provi&s;ions. This
Forenoon I &s;teered from St. <HI>Julian</HI> North-north-ea&s;t,
and made what Sail I could to get to <HI>Pert
De&s;ier:</HI> This Night it was a &s;mall gale, and
veered to the We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t; I judge it be&s;t to
make my ea&s;ie Sail in the Night, for fear of run|ning
up with the Eady Stone-Rocks before day|light.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day <HI>September</HI> 21. Fair Weather to day,
the Wind veerable round the Compa&s;s. This
Morning I had both the Boats leden with Seals,
and Penguins and Penguin-eggs; ten Men may
kill ten thou&s;and Penguins in le&s;s than an hours
time; the Seals and Penguins are numberle&s;s:
a Man cannot pa&s;s on the I&s;land for them. This
Evening I got on board and landed our lading a|&s;hore;
fair Weather to Night. The Eggs are
very good Nouri&s;hment, and the Fat &s;erves for Oil
to the Lamps.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day <HI>September</HI> 22. Fair Weather, Wind
at We&s;t. This day I divided the Eggs among&s;t

the Men: we skinned the Seals and the Penguins,
and &s;alted the Fle&s;h in bulk on the Rock, and co|vered
it to keep the Wind from it: good Wea|ther
and little Wind to Night.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>September</HI> 30. The Wind at North this
Morning; this forenoon it came to the South-ea&s;t,
and blew hard, and rained. This day I went
up the River about ten miles, and <HI>Don Carolus</HI> with
me, and ten Men to &s;ee for People: we lay out all
Night on the South-&s;ide, but &s;aw no People; this
Night the people of the Country came to our little
Well, which is up in the Valley, and &s;tole an Iron
Pot, and three &s;uits of Cloaths of the Mens, that
were laid there a drying, with &s;ome other Lin|nen;
but did not meddle with the Beads, which
are hung up on a Pole on the Hills, and they will
not come near it nor meddle with it: The Peo|ple
of the Country have made in a Valley, the
form of the Ship in Earth and Bu&s;hes, and &s;tuck
up pieces of &s;ticks for Ma&s;ts, and redded the
Bu&s;hes all over with red Earth; the Model I ima|gine
is to record our Ship, for they cannot
have any Records but by imitation: This Fancy
we let alone untouched, only I laid a &s;tring or two
of Beads on it and came away: clo&s;e Weather to
Night. The&s;e People mu&s;t certainly have recei|ved
&s;ome injury in former times, from &s;ome Peo|ple

<P>Here is Anchoring all about this Part of the
<HI>Streights,</HI> in the fair way from <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI>
till you come into the Narrow. I did not find much
Tide any where hereabout, but in the Narrow,
and there the Tide runs &s;tronger than it does in
the <HI>Hope</HI> a good matter; the floud Tide &s;ets into
the <HI>Streights,</HI> and the Ebb &s;ets out; it keepeth
its cour&s;e, as on other Coa&s;ts: it is &s;ix hours
Floud and two hours Ebb; it ri&s;eth and falls near
four Fathom perpendicular; it is an high Water
here, on the change day of the Moon at eleven of
the Clock, as far as I could perceive. Many beds
of Rock-weed are driving to and fro here. This
day at two of the Clock I was a-brea&s;t of Point
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I &s;teered from thence We&s;t-north-we&s;t
about two Leagues, and then We&s;t and We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t:
and South-we&s;t and by South, round|ing
by the North-&s;hore: As I &s;hoaled my &s;ound|ings
I had 22, and 18, and 16, and 12, and 9
Fathoms, &s;andy, and &s;ometimes gravelly Ground
and pebble Stones; I &s;ailed, rounding the &s;hore
being unacquainted, and could not tell certainly
where the Narrow lay, for it was &s;hut in one Land
with the other, &s;o as I could not &s;ee the opening:
I was open of the Narrow at five a Clock, having
a fine gale at North-north-ea&s;t. I &s;teered in South-we&s;t
and by South into the chops of it, but could
not get pa&s;t a League into it; the Tide being
bent out and run &s;o &s;trong as I could not &s;tem it&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="52">
I was in danger of running the Ship again&s;t &s;teep
Rocks, which lie in the North-&s;ide, the taking a
&s;hear with the Tide, and the Wind was a fre&s;h
gale at North-north-ea&s;t. There grew long Rock|weed
on the Rocks; I went and &s;ounded over
them, and had five foot Water on them, and four|teen
Fathom by the &s;ide of them, next the Chan|nel:
they come trenting from the point of the Nar|row
of the North-&s;ide, a mile off. At &s;ix of the
Clock the Wind came to the North; at eight of
the Clock it came to the North-we&s;t; it fell very
dark and rained much; I was forced to fall
back again out of the Narrow as well as I could;
the &s;hore I could not &s;ee, it was &s;o dark; it fell,
a flat Calm, I finding twenty five Fathom Water,
pebble Stones and oary; I anchored and rode all
Night; little Wind at South-we&s;t, and dark.</P>
<P>It is eight Leagues from the fir&s;t Narrow to the
&s;econd, and &s;omething better; the Cour&s;e from
one to the other is We&s;t and by South, and Ea&s;t
and by North. This Reach from the fir&s;t Narrow
to the &s;econd is &s;even Leagues broad, from the
North-&s;hore to the South-&s;hore; it &s;hews like a
little Sea when one comes into it, for we could
not &s;ee to the &s;econd Narrow, till I had &s;ailed
therein three Leagues or more. At the point
of the &s;econd Narrow, on the North-&s;hore;
up to the North-ea&s;t-ward a mile or two, there is
a Bay on the North-&s;hore, and a white Cliff of
an ordinary height, which is called <HI>Cape St. Gre|gory:</HI>
In this Bay you may ride in eight Fathom
Water, fine clean &s;andy Ground, and a good half
mile off the &s;hore; This is a good Road, if the
<PB N="62" REF="53">
Wind be between the North-ea&s;t and the South-we&s;t
to the We&s;tward; the Winds are given mo&s;t
to blow on the We&s;tern-quarter. As I &s;ailed tho|row
the &s;econd Narrow, I &s;ounded in the fair
way, and had twenty eight, and thirty Fathom
&s;mall &s;tones; The North-&s;hore on this Narrow
makes in a Bay at the Ea&s;t-point, and is white Cliffs
all the way through: This Narrow lies throughout
We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, and Ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, and at the
We&s;t-end of the Narrow the Land is &s;teep up, in
white Cliffs, and the South part rounds away in a
rore-land: The South-&s;hore rounds away South-ea&s;t
from this Fore-land, and then it trents away
to the Southward in low Land: The North-&s;hore
of this Narrow or Streight, rounds up to the
Northward in white Cliffs, and falls into &s;hores;
there goes in a Harbour which hath four Fathom
in the Channel, at High-water; it is a flat round
Harbour within, and oary; I called this <HI>Oaz-har|bour:</HI>
When you are at the We&s;t-part of this Nar|row,
you will &s;ee three I&s;lands come open, which
&s;hew to be &s;teep up Cliffs: they lie Triangle-wi&s;e

<HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s, and anchored in eight Fathoms and
an half sine black Sand, two miles off the I&s;land.

This Morning I went a&s;hore on <HI>Elizabeth-I&s;land,</HI>

with them, and exchanged Knives and Beads for
&s;uch things as they had: which were Bows and
Arrows, and their Skin-Coats, which are made of
young <HI>Guianacoes</HI> skins; I gave them a Hatchet and
Knives, and Beads and Toys, Trumps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they
&s;eem'd to be very well-plea&s;ed; I &s;hewed them
Gold, which they would have had; I made them
&s;igns, that if they had any, I would give them
Knives and Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for it, or If any where in
the Land: I laid Gold and bright Copper into
the Ground, and made as if I found it there, and
looked to and fro on the Earth as if I looked for
&s;uch things; they looked one on another and
&s;pake to each other &s;ome words, but I could not
perceive that they under&s;tood me, or what I meant;
nor that they knew Gold, or any other Metal:
they would gladly have had every thing they &s;aw;
they tried to break the Boats Iron-grapenel with
&s;tones, and would have carried it away; I let
them alone, and ob&s;erved their actions and be|haviour,
which was very bruti&s;h: they catched
at every thing they could reach, although I cau&s;ed
them to &s;it down, and I put &s;trings of Beads about
their Necks; &s;till they de&s;ired more: My Lieu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">enant

the courteous re&s;pect I could: After two hours
Conference with them, I made &s;igns I would go
and get more things and come again to them;
They went, and would have us to Land again un|der
a Cliff, which I judge was their De&s;ign, to
heave &s;tones into the Boat to &s;ink her, for the
place was very convenient for &s;uch a purpo&s;e:
They &s;et them&s;elves down on the Gra&s;s, and im|mediately
&s;et fire on the Gra&s;s on the &s;ide of the
Bank: by what means they got Fire &s;o &s;uddenly
I could not under&s;tand. I went and &s;ounded the
Channel between <HI>Elizabeth-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>St. Bartho|lomew's-I&s;land,</HI>
and found it a fair Channel to Sail
through, of a mile broad neare&s;t and deep Wa|ter:
in the middle thirty eight Fathom, and
nine and ten Fathom near the Shore-&s;ide, gravel|ly
Sand.</P>

I did not &s;ee any other dome&s;tick Creature they

<P><HI>October</HI> 30. To Night I anchored in a &s;mall

Beech-timber in <HI>England;</HI> the Leaves of the Trees
are like green Birch-tree leaves, curiou&s;ly &s;weet;

<P>I travelled in many places, but could not &s;ee
any Fruit-trees, or Oak, or A&s;h, or Ha&s;el, or
<PB N="69" REF="56">
any Timber like ours in <HI>England:</HI> Here are but
two &s;orts or Timber in all the&s;e Woods, and one
is the Pepper-rind Tree, which is indifferent
Wood, and the other is the Timber much like
Beech: Here are the be&s;t and bigge&s;t Trees in all
the <HI>Streights;</HI> here are Trees of two foot and an

long; there may be great Planks cut out of them.
I could not &s;ee any grains of Metal of Mineral
in any place, and I looked very carefully in Gul|lies,
and places where Water had guttered. Here
are &s;ome Herbs to be plucked up, as we boiled
for Salleting, and green Gra&s;s with it, which reli&s;h|ed
pretty well. The Land in the Woods is dry,
and of a gravelly and &s;andy Soil, and &s;ome places
good brown Earth; it is bad travelling in the
Woods for old Trees and Under-woods: the
Woods trent all up on the &s;ides of the Hills; the
Land all about on the North-we&s;t and We&s;t of
<HI>Port Famen,</HI> trents up to very high Hills, and
the In-land is very high Hills; for we can &s;ee the
tops of them all barren and ragged, peeping over
tho&s;e Mountains next to the Shore-&s;ide; much
Snow lies continually on them: the Land on the

with &s;ome Whales &s;pouting in the main Channel.</P>
<P>I do verily believe that in the&s;e Mountains,
there is &s;ome Metal either Gold or Copper, for
the Man that went aboard pointed up to the

my Ring. The&s;e People eat up the Provi&s;ion
<PB N="70" REF="57">
which was carried to them, and grea&s;ed them|&s;elves
all over with the Oil, and grea&s;ed their Skin-Coats
with it: I made &s;igns to them to go
and get &s;ome Gold and bring it to me: &s;ome of
them went away to their Boats, the re&s;t &s;at &s;till
on the Gra&s;s, talking one to another, and point|ing
to the Ship. Their Language is much in the
Throat, and not very fluent, but uttered with
good deliberation: I could not perceive but only
the younger were obedient to the elder, and the
Women were in obedience to the Men; for I
took the Mens Coats and put about the Women,
but the Men would not &s;uffer them to keep the
Coats long, and them&s;elves to be naked, but
took the Coats from the Women, and put them
about them&s;elves: I proffer'd them to exchange
one of my Lads for one of theirs, and they laugh|ed;
but the <HI>Indian</HI> Lad would not go with me,
but hung back: I gave to the Men Knives and
Fi&s;h-hooks, and to the Lads Jews-trumps and
Pipes, and to the Women Looking-gla&s;&s;es and
Beads. I did this to gain their loves, and in
hopes to have Trading with them for the future;
they refus'd Brandy.</P>

<P>Monday <HI>Noveomber</HI> 7. Cloudy gu&s;ts, foggy
Weather, the Wind at We&s;t, and &s;ometimes at
North-we&s;t: I rode fa&s;t all day clo&s;e aboard the

to the South-&s;ide, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Elizabeth's-Bay,</HI> at
the Point called <HI>Whale-point,</HI> for the many Whales
&s;pouting thereby. I travelled up the Hills two
miles, but could not &s;ee any Gold or Metal; the
Land very irregular and Rocky, with mo&s;sy kind
of Gra&s;s growing on it, and very boggy and rot|ten;
for I thru&s;t down a Lance of &s;ixteen feet
long, into the Ground with one hand very ea&s;ily:
Here grow many Juniper Trees, &s;ome of a foot
throughout, the Wood not very &s;weet: Here I &s;aw
many brant-Gee&s;e and Ducks, much Snow on the
inland Mountains, &s;o as I could not travel any
farther: I returned down to the Boat again; I
&s;aw where the Natives had been by the evening
of the Gra&s;s, but I could not have a &s;ight of any.
Here are many good Mu&s;cles on the Rocks of
five Inches long, and good Fi&s;h in them, and many
&s;eed Pearls in every Mu&s;cle: Here are al&s;o large
Limpets and Sea-eggs among the Rocks.</P>
<P>All the Ripling is not worth the taking notice
of, for it is but an hours time on both Tides Ebb
and Floud, when the Tide runs &s;trong; neither
are the Tides any thing prejudicial to the Navi|gation
of the Streight, but rather advantagious to
help to turn from Road to Road either way: For
I have had a benefit of them in plying from place
to place. The Weather indifferent this After|noon;
<PB N="74" REF="59">
I went a-&s;hore after I had done Sounding
but &s;aw no People nor any Metal; the Woods
very thick, and &s;everal Trees of the hot Bark, the
other Trees much like Beech-timber: &s;ome Ducks
and brant-Gee&s;e &s;een on the Shore-&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Streight in this Reach between <HI>Elizabeth's
Bay</HI> and St. <HI>Jerom's River</HI> is about two Leagues,
broad and high Land on the South-&s;ide; which
hath &s;everal brave Coves on it like the Wet-dock at
<HI>Deptford,</HI> and &s;afe to lay Ships in them from either
much Wind or any Sea. This Bay I called <HI>Mu|&s;cle-Bay,</HI>
for in it there are many and great plen|ty
of good Mu&s;cles. The Shore-&s;ides are rocky,
&s;teep too in mo&s;t places; no Ground in the main
Channel; at an hundred Fathom; al&s;o in the Bays
on the South-&s;ide it is deep Water, and &s;mall
I&s;lands lie in the Bays, and clo&s;e along the South|&s;hore
lie &s;mall I&s;lands. Here are many Whales,
and I &s;aw many Penguins, and &s;ome Seals: The
Shores are woody on both &s;ides, but ragged Tim|ber
and boggy Ground; the tops of the Hills
bare Rocks and irregular: &s;everal &s;treams of
Snow-water run down in the Cliffs of the Hills,
two Leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Elizabeth's-Bay.</HI>
On the North-&s;hore the Land is low and woody
near the Water-&s;ide, and up of a Valley in this
Low-land: In this Valley there runs a fre&s;h Wa|ter-River;
I went it with my Boat: It is
but &s;hallow at low Water, hardly Water enough
for my Boat: Here I &s;aw &s;everal Arbors of the
<HI>Indians</HI> making, but no People. This River is
a very convenient place to lay Shallops, or
&s;uch like &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els in it; they may go into
<PB N="75" REF="59">
it at high Water, for the Tide ri&s;eth here eight
or nine feet: this River I called by the name of
<HI>Batchelor's River.</HI> Before the mouth of this River,
in the <HI>Streights,</HI> there is good anchoring, in nine,
or ten, or twelve Fathom Water, &s;andy Ground;
a fair birth off the Shore: the Tide runs but or|dinary,
and the Floud-tide comes from the We&s;t|ward,
and the Tide that comes out of St. <HI>Je|rom</HI>'s
Channel, makes a ripling with the Tide that
comes along the &s;tream of the <HI>Streight:</HI> I called
this Road that is before <HI>Batchelor's-River, York-Road:</HI>
This is a good place to ride in with We|&s;terly
Winds, for here cannot go any great Sea;
neither &s;hall a Man be embayed; that if a Cable
give way, he may have the Streight open to carry
it away; for the We&s;terly Winds are the greate&s;t
Winds that blow here by the Trees, for they all
&s;toop to the&s;e Winds, and lean to the Ea&s;terward,
and the We&s;t-&s;ide of all the Trees that &s;tand o|pen,
are made flat with the Winds: the tops of
the Mountains look to the Ea&s;tward; the Ea&s;ter|ly
Winds &s;eldom blow &s;trong here as to what I
have ob&s;erved. By the Shore-&s;ide which lies open
to the Ea&s;t, the Gra&s;s grows down to the Water|&s;ide,
and they are the greener Shores, and the
Trees are &s;treight and tall on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the
Hills, but on the We&s;t-&s;hores, the Gra&s;s and
Trees are much weather-beaten, worn away, and
crippled, and the Shore-&s;ides much tewed with the
&s;urge of the Waters.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cape Quad,</HI> the Lands &s;hut one with the o|ther,
as if there were no farther pa&s;&s;age: but as
you make nearer to it, you will &s;ee the opening
<PB N="76" REF="60">
more and more, as the Streight rounds there more
to the Northward again. <HI>Cape Quad</HI> is on the
North-&s;hore; and it is a &s;teep up Cape, of a rocky
greyi&s;h Face, of a good height before one comes
at it: it &s;hews like a great building of a Ca&s;tle;
for it points off with a Race from the other
Mountains, &s;o much into the Channel of the
Streight, that it makes &s;hutting in again&s;t the
South-land, and maketh an Elbow in the Streight:
the Streight is not pa&s;t four miles broad here,
from &s;hore to &s;hore; and the Land is &s;teep too
on both &s;ides, and rocky; the Mountains high
on both Shores, and craggy barren Rocks: &s;ome
Trees and Bu&s;hes growing here, and much Snow
on the Mountains on both &s;ides. Oppo&s;ite to <HI>Cape
Quad</HI> on the South-&s;ide, there is a fine large Bay,
which is called <HI>Rider's Bay:</HI> I did not go into it;
if there be Anchoring in it, it is a fair Road for
any Winds: the Water is very deep here in the
Channel, no Ground at one hundred Fathom:
this part of the Streights, from <HI>Point Pa&s;&s;age</HI> to
<HI>Cape Quad,</HI> is the mo&s;t crooked part of all the
Streight; therefore I called this <HI>Crooked-Reach.</HI>
Here are two &s;mall I&s;lands in the North-&s;hore, to
the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Cape Quad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 14. This Morning I was a-bre&s;t of
<HI>Cape-Munday,</HI> &s;o I called it, it being a Cape on
the South-&s;ide, and is di&s;tant from <HI>Cape de Quad</HI>
about thirteen Leagues: the Streight here is a|bout
four miles broad, and the North-&s;hore makes
into the Land with great &s;ounds and broken I&s;lands;
the Land on both Shores is high rocky Hills, and
barren, very little Wood or Gra&s;s growing on
<PB N="77" REF="60">
them: Here at <HI>Cape Munday,</HI> the Streight grows
broader and broader to the We&s;tward, but keeps
all one Cour&s;e, North-we&s;t and by We&s;t to <HI>Cape
Upright;</HI> which is a &s;teep upright Cliff on the
South-&s;ide, and it is di&s;tant from <HI>Cape Munday</HI>
four Leagues. Here the Streight inclines to the
We&s;tward near half-a Point: the Streight lies
from <HI>Cape Munday</HI> We&s;t-north-we&s;t, half a Point
Northerly right out into the South-Sea, if you
be in the middle of the Channel, or nigh the
North-&s;hore; I find little or no Tide to run here,
or Current: no Ground in the Channel at two
hundred Fathom, a Musket &s;hot off the Shore
on either &s;ide. Here run into the South-&s;hore
many Sounds and Coves; I have &s;ailed fair along
by the South-&s;hore all this day; for the North-&s;hore
makes in broken I&s;lands and Sounds: Here
lie all along the South-&s;hore &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands,
but no danger, for they are all &s;teep too: the
Streight is a very fair Channel to &s;ail throughout.
This day at Noon, I was a-brea&s;t of an I&s;land,
which lies on the North-&s;ide of the Streight, I cal|led

<P>I went a-&s;hore with my Boats for fre&s;h Water,
which I had them laden with pre&s;ently; for here is
fre&s;h Water enough, and very good; I &s;earched
the Shore what I could, I &s;aw on old Hutt or

Arbour of the <HI>Indians</HI> making, and &s;everal &s;ticks
that were cut, but all old done. I could not &s;ee
any &s;ign of People on the I&s;land now; I believe
the People come rambling to this I&s;land from the
Main in the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the Year to get young
Fowls: for I do not &s;ee any thing el&s;e in the I&s;land
for the &s;u&s;tenance of Mans Life; I could not &s;ee
any kind of Mineral or Metal: the Soil is a &s;andy
black Earth, and &s;ome Banks of Rocks: the I&s;land
is irregular, and grown all over with impene|trable
thick Woods, &s;o as I could not &s;ee the in|ward
part of it: the Woods are ordinary Tim|ber,
none that I &s;aw was fit to make Planks of;
the nature of the Wood is much like Beech and
Birch, and a &s;ort of heavy Wood good for little but
the fire, it is white: no Fruit or Herbs; very little
Gra&s;s, the Woods are &s;o thick; much kind of long
&s;edgy Gra&s;s; no wild Bea&s;t to be &s;een; &s;everal
&s;mall Birds in the Woods like Sparrows: there
are &s;everal Fowls like Kites in the Woods, &s;everal
black and white brant-Gee&s;e and pied Shags, and
other &s;uch Sea-Fowls, as Pinks and Sea-mews:
what el&s;e the I&s;land affords I cannot tell. I made
a Fire on the Shore, in hopes to have &s;ome an|&s;wer
of it on the Main, but had not. At Noon
I went aboard, and &s;ent my Boats a-&s;hore again
for more Wood and Water, whil&s;t the Weather
permitted landing.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 30. This Forenoon I was over on
the main &s;ide, the Ship lay off, and in. I went a|&s;hore
with my Boat on an I&s;land which lieth ad|jacent
to the Main:
There runs a Channel be|tween
that and the Main, and many Rocks lie
<PB N="82" REF="63">
in it, and foul Ground, &s;o as I dur&s;t not venture
the Ship in it. This I&s;land &s;hewed as if it had
been the Main, till I went to it with the Boat;
being about four Leagues long from the North-point
to the South-point, and in &s;ome places a
League broad. The I&s;land is of a mean height,
and in &s;ome places two Leagues broad, and grown
all over with Woods very thick: the Timber is
&s;uch like as is on the I&s;le of <HI>Socoro:</HI> I could
not &s;ee any kind of Mineral or Metal in it; the
Shore-&s;ide &s;andy in many places, and rocky in o|thers;
the Earth on this I&s;land is of a &s;andy black
&s;oil, but very wet with the continual Rains that
are here. Not finding this noted in my Draughts,
I called it after my own Name <HI>Narbrough's-I&s;land;</HI>
I took po&s;&s;e&s;ion of it for his Maje&s;ty and his
Heirs: I could not &s;ee any People, or any &s;ign of
them here.</P>
<P>South-ea&s;t from <HI>Narbrough's-I&s;land</HI> on the Main
di&s;tant about three Leagues, there runs into the
Land a River or Sound, and &s;ome broken ground
lies before it. The Shore-&s;ide is rocky, and the
Hills are high in the Land on both &s;ides of it;
this opening lies in Ea&s;t and We&s;t, I take it for
that place which in the Draughts is called <HI>Saint

<P>At eight of the Clock in the Forenoon my

in point <HI>Gallery,</HI> to the place where <HI>Don Carlos</HI> was

the Port; the Boat rowed all along the Shore by
the place where <HI>Don Carlos</HI> was landed, and along
the Shore into the Harbour; at the Points on the
South-&s;ide of the Harbour &s;tands a &s;mall Fort of
&s;even Guns called S. <HI>James's Fort:</HI> My Boat came
&s;uddenly on it, and before they perceived it to
be a Fort, they were within &s;hot of it. The <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
&s;tood on the Shore; and wa&s;ted with a
white Flag, and called to them; My Lieutenant
rowed to them, and asked of them what Coun|try
they were? they an&s;wered, of <HI>Spain:</HI> They
asked my Lieutenant of what Country he was?
He an&s;wered, of <HI>England;</HI> they asked him to
come a-&s;hore, whch he did, in hopes to have &s;een
<HI>Don Carlos</HI> there, for that path that <HI>Don Carlos</HI>
went in when he was landed, led directly to this
Fort by the Sea-&s;ide, and it was not a Mile from
the Fort to the place where he was landed, &s;o as
he mu&s;t go to this Fort, and be upon it before he
was aware of it, unle&s;s he knew it before. The
<PB N="87" REF="65">
path went all along between the Woods and the
Sea: In the Woods there is no travelling, they
are &s;o thick, and grow on the &s;ide of an Hill;
the Fort &s;tands ju&s;t by the Wood-&s;ide on a race of
the Bank, of five yards a&s;cent from the Sea,
with a bank of Earth ca&s;t up before the Ord|nance,
and flight Palli&s;adoes plac'd in an Half-moon,
four yards di&s;tant from the Guns to the
Southward, which Palli&s;adoes are to keep the
Natives from running violently on the Ord|nance:
&s;o the&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> guard them&s;elves with
long Lances again&s;t the Natives in the Fort. The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have Match-lock Mu&s;quetoons, but
they are very ordinary ones, and they are as &s;illy
in u&s;ing them.</P>
<P>At my Lieutenants landing, about twenty <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
and <HI>Indians</HI> came to the Water-&s;ide in Arms,
and received him and his Company a-&s;hore, and
carried him &s;ome twenty yards from the Water|&s;ide
up the race of the Bank, under a great Tree,
where the Captain of the Fort, and two other <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Gentlemen, received him under the &s;hade with
great Courte&s;ie, after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Ceremony;
they &s;at them on Chairs and Benches placed about
a Table, under the &s;hade; for the Sun &s;hone
very warm, it being a very fair Day. The <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Captain called for Wine, which was brought
to him in a great Silver Bowl; He drank to my
Lieutenant, and bid him welcome a-&s;hore, and
cau&s;ed five of his Ordnance to be fired, being
glad to &s;ee <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men in this place, and told
him that this was <HI>Baldavia,</HI> &s;peaking very kindly,
and how welcome they were to him: After every
<PB N="88" REF="66">
one had drank, and my Lieutenant had thanked
him for his Entertainment, he de&s;ired my Gentle|men
to &s;it down, and he di&s;cour&s;ed with them,
and asked from whence they came, and what way
they came into this Sea, and what their Captains
Name was, and if there were Wars in <HI>England?</HI>
My Lieutenant an&s;wered him to his demands:
My Lieutenant asked him, if they were in peace
with the <HI>Indians?</HI> He an&s;wered, that they were
at Wars with them round about, wafting his Hand
round the Harbour, and that they were valiant
People and very barbarous, and fought on Hor&s;e|back,
and did them much spoil; and that two days
before, the <HI>Indians</HI> came out of the Woods and
killed a Captain, as he &s;tood at his Duty by the
&s;ide of the Fort, and cut off his Head and carried
it away, &s;ticking on their Lance. He &s;hewed my
Lieutenant the place where the <HI>Indians</HI> came out
of the Woods, and the place where the Man was
killed. They &s;eem to be very fearful of the <HI>In|dians,</HI>
for they will not &s;tir any way, but they
will have their Piece or their Lance with them.
It is a manife&s;t &s;ign they are much affraid of the
<HI>Indians:</HI> al&s;o they have no more ground than the
Fort; neither do they clear any of the Woods on
this &s;ide of the Harbour, nor walk at a Mu&s;quet|&s;hot
di&s;tance from the Palli&s;adoes, along the
Woods-&s;ide. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ay that the <HI>Indians</HI>
have much Gold, and that their Armour for their
Bre&s;t is fine beaten Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon a Dinner was brought out of
the Fort to the Tent, where they were, and placed
on the Table: The fir&s;t Cour&s;e was Soppas, then
<PB N="89" REF="66">
Olleos, then Pullets, then fre&s;h Fi&s;h, all dre&s;&s;ed
with hot Sawce, and very good Diet it was; the
la&s;t Cour&s;e was Sweet-meats: every Cour&s;e was
&s;erved in Silver Di&s;hes, and all the Plates were
Silver, and the Pots and Stew-pots, and all the
Uten&s;ils belonging to the dre&s;&s;ing of the Provi|&s;ions
were Silver; the Ba&s;on wherein they brought
Water to wa&s;h their Hands was in like manner
made of Silver, very large, and the Hilts of the
Soldiers Swords were Silver, but the Hilts of the
Officers Swords were Gold of good value: More|over,
the Plate at the But-end of the Stock of
their Mu&s;quetoons was of the &s;ame Metal, and
the Pipe that the Rod runs in was Silver; as al&s;o
the tip of the Gun-&s;tick, and their Tobacco-Boxes,
and Snuff-Boxes, and the Staves which
they walk with were headed and ferrelled with
Silver, and ferrelled on the joints with Silver. In|deed
they are Ma&s;ters of much Silver and Gold,
and it is but little e&s;teemed among them.
Their boa&s;ting was <HI>Plata no vallanada muchoro in

<P>Four <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentlemen de&s;ired to go aboard
with my Lieutenant, and &s;ee the Ship, and Pilot
her into the Harbour, if I would come in, which
they did not que&s;tion but I would, as I under|&s;tood
afterward by a <HI>Spaniard</HI> that came aboard
to me, who revealed to me their whole De&s;ign,
how they intended to &s;urpri&s;e the Ship, which I
ever took care to prevent, giving them no oppor|tunity:
For it hath been a general practice with
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to betray all forein In|tere&s;t
in the&s;e parts; as I had read of their trea|cherous
<PB N="90" REF="67">
dealings with Captain <HI>Hawkins</HI> at Saint
<HI>Juan de Vlloa.</HI></P>
<P>I had much Di&s;cour&s;e with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentle|men
this day concerning <HI>Baldavia,</HI> and the Coun|try
of <HI>Chile:</HI> They tell me they have much Gold
here at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> and that the Natives do much
hinder their getting of it; for they are at cruel
Wars with them, and will not permit them to plant
anything near here about, nor at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> but they
come and de&s;troy it with Fire. And that the Na|tives
are very cruel and barbarous; if they take
any <HI>Spaniard</HI> they cut off his Head, and carry it
away on their Lances end. The&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> tell
me that they live here, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do at <HI>Ma|mora</HI>
in <HI>Barbary,</HI> having their Enemies round a|bout
them. The&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ay, that the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
are tall Men, and of a Gigantick &s;tature and
extreamly Valiant, and that they fight on Hor&s;e|back,
eight and ten thou&s;and Men in Arms, and
well di&s;ciplin'd. The <HI>Indians</HI> have much Gold;
and their Weapons are long Lances, and Bows,
and Arrows, and Swords and &s;ome Mu&s;quets,
which they have taken from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
know how to u&s;e them in Service; taking al&s;o
Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> are very popu|lous
in the Land about <HI>Baldavia,</HI> and at <HI>Or&s;ono,</HI>
and on the I&s;land of <HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> and at <HI>Chile,</HI> and
that they have much Gold on the&s;e parts about <HI>Or|&s;ono,</HI>
and <HI>Chilue,</HI> and that they trade with the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
and give them Gold.</P>
<P>This Captain &s;aid, that they have &s;ix great
Ships going yearly from <HI>Lima</HI> to the <HI>Philippine</HI>
I&s;lands, to the Port of <HI>Mannelos,</HI> and that they
<PB N="91" REF="67">
have a great Trade with the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> and that
the&s;e Ships &s;ail from the <HI>Calleo,</HI> that is the Port of
<HI>Lima</HI> in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> and their pa&s;&s;age
is but little more than two Months, from <HI>Lima</HI>
to the Port of <HI>Mannelos,</HI> and they &s;ail it within
the Tropicks, and have much Ea&s;terly Winds;
and they return back by the Northwards, to gain
the We&s;terly Winds, which brings them to <HI>Cali|fornia,</HI>
and to the Port of <HI>Aquapulco,</HI> which lieth
on the We&s;t-Coa&s;t of <HI>Nova E&s;pana,</HI> and from thence
they come to <HI>Panama,</HI> and then to the Port of
<HI>Lima.</HI> They bring rich Lading, much Silks and
other rich Commodities, and Spices and Callicoes.
The <HI>Mannellos</HI> have a great Trade with the <HI>Japone|&s;es</HI>
and <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> which is very beneficial to them.
The Captain demanded of me whither I was
bound? I an&s;wered him, I was bound for <HI>China,</HI>
and that I had rich Lading for that Country; and
that I only touched in at this place, knowing here
were Settlements of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Subjects,
hoping here to have Wood and fre&s;h Water, and
refre&s;hing for my Men, whereby I might the bet|ter
proceed on my Voyage. He &s;aid, I &s;hould
have what the Country would afford, and that
the Captain of the Fort had &s;ent for Provi&s;ions
for me, and that I might have Water on the
Shore-&s;ides pointing his Hand to the place which
was near by; the Captain &s;aid, it was <HI>Aqua del
oro</HI> (which is <HI>Water of Gold</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>) This
&s;aying cau&s;ed me to laugh; then he &s;aid, it came
running from the Hills where they find Gold, and
that there was Gold in that Rivulet. I asked
him how they get the Gold? He &s;aid, they wa&s;h
<PB N="92" REF="68">
the Earth which is in the Mountains, and find
the Gold in the Bowl or Tray when the Earth is
wa&s;hed out. And they buy much Gold of the
<HI>Indians,</HI> which they gather in the Gullies of the
Hills, which is wa&s;hed in there by the Rains, and
&s;now di&s;&s;olv'd, which de&s;cend from the high Moun|tains,
which they &s;ay are very high and barren
Rocks, thirty Leagues In-land from the Sea-&s;hore.
The Land between tho&s;e barren Hills and the
Sea-&s;hore, is mighty good Land, and the Country
very fruitful, abounding in many Plains, and
much Cattle that the <HI>Indians</HI> have, as Hor&s;es and
Cows, and Goats and Sheep, which they have taken
from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ince they came into this
Country. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call the high rocky
Mountains the <HI>Andes,</HI> and &s;ay that tho&s;e <HI>Andes</HI>
run all along the Land from <HI>Magellan</HI> Streights in
a row to S. <HI>Martha,</HI> which is in <HI>Terra firma,</HI> not far
from <HI>Cartagean.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t Gold in all the Land of <HI>America</HI> is
in <HI>Chile,</HI> as what is known at this time. But I
find the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have but little knowledge of
the Land all along to the Southward, from <HI>Balda|via</HI>
to the Streights Mouth, as far as I can under|&s;tand
by them, excepting at the I&s;land of <HI>Ca&s;tro:</HI>
There they have a Settlement, and on the Main
against <HI>Ca&s;tro</HI> at a place called <HI>Or&s;ono:</HI> At the&s;e
two places they have good &s;tore of Gold, and
there are many <HI>Indians:</HI> but farther Southerly
than <HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> they know nothing of the Country,
or of the Sea-Coa&s;t. <HI>Ca&s;tro</HI> lieth in the Latitude
of 43 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> the South end of the I&s;land,
and the North end lies in the Latitude of 41<HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="68">
40<HI>m.</HI> It is a fine I&s;land, and near the Main, there
grows good Wheat on it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are but
few in number there, but there are many <HI>Indians,</HI>
and tho&s;e too valiant and of a large &s;tature;
but not Giants as I under&s;tand: The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI>
have Wars with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and will not &s;uf|fer
them to &s;earch the Country for Wealth.</P>
<P>A Ship brought from <HI>Lima</HI> Provi&s;ions for the
City of <HI>Baldavia</HI> and the Forts, and Cloaths, and
Ammunition, and Wines, and Tobacco, and Su|gar;
and &s;he lades away from <HI>Baldavia</HI> Gold and
Bezoar Stone, and red Wool, &amp;c. and <HI>Indian</HI>
Slaves that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take here in the&s;e parts;
they carry them to <HI>Peru,</HI> and make perpetual Slaves
of them there; and the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> they bring
hither, and make Soldiers of them again&s;t the
<HI>Chile-Indians,</HI> of which Soldiers there are many
hereabout, whom my Men &s;aw when they were
at the Fort. There were about thirty <HI>Indians</HI>
and <HI>Mu&s;te&s;es</HI> Soldiers there, and &s;ome &s;ixteen
white Men who were Officers. Moreover, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> make u&s;e of the <HI>Peru-Indians</HI> to Trade
with the <HI>Chile-Indians</HI> for Gold, although they are
at Wars. For they of <HI>Chile</HI> without doubt are de|&s;irous
of Trade, whereby they may furni&s;h them|&s;elves
with Knives, and Sci&s;&s;ers, and Combs, &amp;c.
which are wanting among them; as al&s;o with
Arms that many times by &s;tealth are &s;old to them,
although they be prohibited; Traders will be
dealing; &s;o as they can get benefit, they do not
con&s;ider the future danger by its means, provided
it mi&s;s them at the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="69">
I asked them how far it was to <HI>Baldavia?</HI> they
an&s;wered me, three Leagues, and that the Boats
could go up to it, and that it was &s;ituated by the
&s;ide of the River and the Plains, and that there
were five great Ordnances in a Fort to command
the City, and that there were one thou&s;and In|habitants
in the City of all &s;orts of Men, Women
and Children. I asked him, if there were any
pa&s;&s;age by Land from <HI>Baldavia</HI> to the other parts
of <HI>Chile?</HI> they &s;aid there was, and they &s;ent eve|ry
Week, but they went with good Guards to go
&s;ecure from the <HI>Indians.</HI> Then I asked them if
they built Shipping here? they &s;aid no, but at
<HI>Velperrazeo</HI> they did build great Ships. I asked
them who lived in the I&s;land of <HI>Mocha?</HI> they &s;aid
<HI>Indians,</HI> many Men and Women, and that they
were <HI>Poco amigo'</HI> s to them; in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they were
but &s;mall Friends to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> There are
many Sheep, Goats, Hogs and Hens, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> will &s;ell for Hatchets, Knives and Beads.
As to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Ma|&s;ters
of it, and have a Fort on it with five Guns,
but few <HI>Spaniards</HI> live there: it is plentiful of
Provi&s;ions, as Hogs, and Sheep, and Corn, and
Potatoes: and they &s;aid there is &s;ome Gold, that
the <HI>Indians</HI> have on the I&s;land of <HI>Mocha,</HI> but they
will not part from it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not care for
an&s;wering me to &s;uch things as I would gladly
have heard of the&s;e parts; for I laid the Draught
of all that Coa&s;t on the Table before them, and
asked them who lived at this Port, and who lived
at that: at &s;ome places they would &s;ay, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
lived there, and at &s;ome the <HI>Indians.</HI> but
<PB N="95" REF="69">
they did not care to an&s;wer my de&s;ires, but frame
other Di&s;cour&s;es to wave mine. I find that they
are but little acquainted on the Coa&s;ts to the
Southward of <HI>Baldavia;</HI> they &s;ay they have <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
living on the I&s;land of <HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> and that much
Corn grows there, more e&s;pecially <HI>European</HI>
Wheat; and that on the Main there are <HI>Spaniards</HI>
living at a place called <HI>Or&s;ono,</HI> which is again&s;t
<HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> and that there they have Gold, and there
are many <HI>Indians</HI> I asked him if Shipping could
go in between <HI>Ca&s;tro</HI> and the Main? they could
not tell me, or would not; but they &s;aid &s;ome
Ships went thither, which come from <HI>Lima</HI> with
Furniture for the People.</P>
<P>The Anchoring at the I&s;land of <HI>Mocha</HI> is on the

<P><HI>December</HI> 17. 1670. There went a-&s;hore in
the Boat eighteen of my be&s;t Men I had in the
Ship, and Men of good Ob&s;ervation to in&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
into matters of this Concern, which I had ac|quainted
them with; as touching the manner of
the Harbour, and the Fortifications the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the People; and
that it was my whole de&s;ire to have Confer|ence
with the Natives of the Country that are
at Wars with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if by any mens po&s;|&s;ible
it may be obtained; for it is my whole de|&s;ire</P>

to lay the Foundation of a Trade there for the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation for the future; for I &s;ee plainly this
Country is lo&s;t for want of the true knowledg of it</P>
<P>My Men in the Boat ob&s;erved the Harbour
and the Fortifications, and took good notice of
the people. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> bought &s;everal things
of my Boats Crew: and paid for what things they
bought in good Pillar pieces of Eight; they would
not part from any Gold, although my Men were
de&s;irous to have &s;ome rather than Silver for their
Goods: neither would they part from any Bread in
payment, pretending that they &s;hould have Bread
to morrow from <HI>Baldavia.</HI> The things which
they bought of my Men at this time, were two
Fowling-pieces, which co&s;t in <HI>England</HI> about twen|ty
&s;hillings a piece, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave &s;ix|teen
pieces of Eight apiece for them; and Ca&s;es
of Knives of three &s;hillings the piece in <HI>England,</HI> the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> gave five pieces of Eight for them: and
for &s;ingle ten-penny Wires, they gave a piece
of Eight a piece for them; and for ordina|ry
Leather-gloves, of ten pence the pair, they
gave a piece of Eight a pair; for Broad-Cloath-Coats
of the Seamens, which co&s;t &s;ixteen &s;hil|lings
in <HI>England,</HI> they gave nine pieces of
Eight for a Coat: They were very de&s;irous
to buy Cloaks, and pieces of Bays-cloath. The
Men were very gallant in Apparel in their Plu&s;h-coats,
and under-Garments of Silk and Silver
wrought together, and good Linnen, and good
<HI>Flanders</HI> Laces, and broad about the Crown of
of their Hats, in fa&s;hion of an Hat-band, and a
great Silk-&s;carf with Gold Lace on the ends of

it, that was cro&s;s over their Shoulders: a &s;hort
Cravat of Linnen about their Necks, and a Cane
in their Hand headed with Silver; their Choes,
and Stockings, and Breeches after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa|&s;hion.
They were very kind to my Lieutenant
and Men, and treated them very courteou&s;ly.
They were not permitted to go into the Fort,
but were entertained in a Tent by the Fort.
Four of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Wives would needs go into
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Boat, and &s;it down on the Benches, to
&s;ay that they had been in a Boat which came from

<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, and about their Necks great Gold
Chains, and Pendants at their Ears of Saphir
Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain of St. <HI>Jago's Fort</HI> pre&s;ented my
Lieutenant with a Silver Tobacco-box, and a Sil|ver-headed
Cane, and a Plume of O&s;triches Fea|thers,
which he wore on his Hat at the &s;ame time:
the Feather of the Plume is but &s;mall, nothing &s;o
good as the <HI>Barbary</HI>-Feather: this Plume was of
red, and white, and blew Feathers died in the
Country. I &s;aw another Plume which a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Gentleman gave to Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> which was black
and large, and a very fair one, made of the O&s;tri|ches
Feather of the Country. There are many
O&s;triches in the plain Lands, and <HI>Guianacots,</HI>
which are the Bea&s;ts that bear the red woou
whereof Hats are made in <HI>England.</HI> There is much
<PB N="99" REF="71">
of this Wooll in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chile.</HI></P>
<P>My People could not by any means come to
Conver&s;e with the Natives who are at Wars with
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and have the Gold, without viola|ting
the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Power: for on the Shore with|in
the Harbour, the <HI>Indians</HI> made a Fire by the
Woods &s;ide, and hung out a white Flag on a long
Pole, and kept wafting of it a long time. My
Lieutenant would have gone in his Boat to them,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not permit him, and &s;aid
that they were their own People who lived there.</P>
<P>My Seamen which came aboard in my Boat,
came to me, and told me, that the Lieutenant had
been at Fort St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and had deliver'd my Me&s;|&s;age
there to the Captain, but he had no Order
for my fetching of Water, and that he wi&s;hed my
Lieutenant to go to Fort St. <HI>Peter;</HI> which he did,
and a Frier and two <HI>Spaniards</HI> went over with him
in the Boat, the Flag of Truce flying in the Boat,
and the Trumpeter &s;ounding, according to my
Order, all the time till they landed at the Fort.
At their Landing, the Lieutenant was received
very courteou&s;ly by &s;everal <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentlemen,
and de&s;ired to walk up to the Governour; which
my Lieeutenant did to a Tent where the Go|vernour
was; the Governour received the
Lieutenant very kindly, and de&s;ired him to &s;it
down. My Lieutenant pre&s;ented my re&s;pects to
the Governour, and delivered to him the Chee&s;e
and Butter, togerher with the Spice, Gla&s;&s;es and
Tobacco-pipes, which I &s;ent to him, and acquaint|ed
him, that I &s;ent him to de&s;ire to know if he
would be plea&s;ed to permit my Boat to Water
<PB N="100" REF="72">
to day, for my Boats lay ready, and had the Cask
in them, and I waited his An&s;wer. The Gover|nour
cau&s;ed my Lieutenant and Mr. <HI>Forte&s;cue</HI> to
&s;it down, and drank to them in a Silver Bowl
with <HI>Chile</HI> Wine? He gave no An&s;wer to the

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was taken of the Boat? The Gover|nour
an&s;wered, he had Order from <HI>Don Pedro

them till the Ship was brought into the Har|bour
under the command of the Ca&s;tle, and he
was &s;orry he had no more Officers of the Ships

<P>I examined my Seamen which came in my
Boat from the Lieutenant, and they related to me
the whole matter, and they believed that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
had a de&s;ign to betray the Ship, but they
could not agree among them&s;elves: I talked with
the two <HI>Indians</HI> that came aboard, they could
&s;peak the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue indifferently well; they
told me that I was a Friend to the <HI>Indians</HI> of the
Mountains, and that I was not a <HI>Spaniard:</HI> they
<PB N="102" REF="73">
would needs know of me where my Country is,
and if I would come again; I made them an|&s;wer,
that my Country is a little way off, on the
other &s;ide of the Sea, and that I would come again,
and bring Knives, Hatchets, Beads, Gla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and live in the Country with them, and that they
&s;hould &s;ee my Country; and that my King would
give them many things, and they &s;hould live with
us; and that my King is the greate&s;t King in the
World, and Commands all other Kings, and that
our Names are <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> laughed and
&s;eemed to be very glad: I bad them acquaint the
<HI>Indians</HI> of the Mountains, or In-lands, that I came
to &s;peak with them, and that I was their Friend,
and would give them many Hatchets, and Knives,
and Swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if they would come to me, and
that I came purpo&s;ely to &s;peak with them; and
that my <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> the <HI>Great King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> hath
&s;ent them many things, and would willingly
&s;ee them.</P>
<P>After the&s;e People had heard all that I &s;aid to
them, they &s;at for a time mute, and con&s;idering
of the Kindne&s;&s;es they received from me and my
Company, and that they mu&s;t go a-&s;hore again
under the Command of the cruel <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they
weeped extreamly, and uttered the&s;e words,
<HI>Numbra Spanalos muccho Deablo,</HI> &amp;c. In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> it
is, <HI>The</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>men are much Devils,</HI> &amp;c. I verily
believe that the&s;e poor innocent Creatures &s;peak
truth, for they are great Devils in abu&s;ing the&s;e
poor Souls &s;o unmercifully as they do. In &s;ight
of my Men the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with a great Staff would
&s;trike an <HI>Indian</HI> on the Head as he talked with
<PB N="103" REF="73">
him, and beat him all along, for no cau&s;e at all;
but this they do to &s;hew their Greatne&s;s and Im|periou&s;ne&s;s.
The be&s;t Name the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can
afford to call an <HI>Indian</HI> by, is Dog, and Devil, and
&s;uch like Names.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ay, that there is much Gold in
the Land, and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have much <HI>Oro;</HI>
I gave to each of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> a Knife, and a &s;mall
Looking-gla&s;s, and &s;ome Beads: they were very
thankful, and I put them in mind again to &s;peak
to the <HI>Indians</HI> of the In-land, that I would give
them Knives and Gla&s;&s;es if they would come to
me. I was in great hopes all this time, that I
&s;hould have the opportunity to &s;peak with my
Golden Friends, by the means of the&s;e People;
for they &s;eemed to be glad of the Me&s;&s;age, or of
the things which I gave them to do it.</P>
<P>The&s;e People are of a middle &s;tature, &s;trongly

Cloth like a Carpet, of their own weaving
of the Wool of Guianacoes: they cut an hole
in the middle of this Carpet through which they
put their Head, and it hangs upon their Shoul|ders,

<HI>December</HI> 18. 1670. This Evening I took the
Suns Amplitude with my Compa&s;s, and I had a
good Ob&s;ervation. I find the variation of the
Compa&s;s to be eight Degrees ten Minutes Ea|&s;terly.</P>
<P>I do much rea&s;on with my &s;elf as to the Va|riation,
that it differs &s;o much in the &s;ame Lati|tude,
between the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-&s;ide of the Land
of <HI>America;</HI> for on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide as I &s;ailed in the
Latitude of forty Degrees, I found the Compa&s;s
to have twenty Degrees variation Ea&s;terly, by
&s;everal good Ob&s;ervations, which I took with the
&s;ame In&s;trument as I now do u&s;e, which is a large
<HI>Azimuth</HI> Compa&s;s; and here I find but eight De|grees
and ten Minutes variation; and it is but
eight Degrees of Longitude more We&s;terly in the
&s;ame Parallel, differing between the&s;e Ob&s;erva|tions,
and the difference of Variation.</P>
<P>I find the Land to be but one hundred and
twenty five Leagues broad, from the Ea&s;t-&s;ide to
the We&s;t-&s;ide, in the Latitude of forty Degrees
South of the Equinoctial; certainly the attractive
quality of the Magnet, mu&s;t be very powerful in
the Ea&s;tern part of the Land, more than in the
We&s;tern, which cau&s;eth the difference: yet I ad|mire,
being on both &s;ides of the Land, the Com|pa&s;s
&s;hould always have the &s;ame variation
Ea&s;terly. I was of the Opinion that the va|riation
would have been We&s;terly on the We&s;t-&s;ide,
it being Ea&s;terly on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide: but I
find the contrary by experience; therefore I
believe that the attractive quality is not much in
this part of <HI>America,</HI> but in &s;ome other part more
<PB N="106" REF="75">
to the Ea&s;tward than I was; for if the attractive
quality had been in this Land, and I &s;ailing on both
&s;ides of it, the variation mu&s;t have been Ea&s;terly
on the one &s;ide, and We&s;terly on the other.
This Di&s;cour&s;e I leave to a better Under&s;tanding;
for I am not as yet &s;atisfied what occa&s;ioneth the
variation and the great difference of it, although I
have been on &s;everal Voyages, and have made
great benefit of the Under&s;tanding of the va|riation
of the Compa&s;s, in directing of the true
Cour&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Port of <HI>Baldavia</HI> there are three fair
Rivers, which come out of the Country, and
empty them&s;elves into the Port with a brisk &s;tream
of fre&s;h Water, which cau&s;eth the &s;tream always
to &s;et out of the Harbour, and the Waters to be
fre&s;h ju&s;t within the Harbours-mouth: one Ri|ver
runs up into the South-ea&s;t part of the Har|bour
into the Country; another River runs into
the Country to the Ea&s;tward, on the back-&s;ide of
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort: the third River runs into the
Country, about the North-point of the Harbours-mouth,
between the point and the North-end of
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s I&s;land: it runs up in the North-Ea&s;t|ward,
and nine or ten Mills &s;tand upon the River
from the Harbours-mouth. The City of <HI>Balda|via</HI>
is &s;ituated on the Bank of the River, as the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
tell me.</P>
<P>I judge this City of <HI>Baldavia</HI> is but a &s;mall
place, and kept only as a Garri&s;on, and a place
for Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> for Gold, Bezoar|&s;tones,
Guianacoes-Wooll, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
that were aboard, and the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aid, that there
<PB N="107" REF="75">
were but five great Guns in it, and three hundred
Men. I know that they &s;peak of the mo&s;t of
every thing in the matters as concerning their
&s;trength and number of Men.</P>
<P>I believe that the&s;e Rivers may run into the
Country a long way, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to have
but little knowledge in the inward parts of this
Country: for the <HI>Indians</HI> will not &s;uffer the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;earch into the In-lands. I believe
al&s;o that the&s;e Rivers are not Navigable for Ship|ping;
for the Bark which was there would cer|tainly
have gone up the River to the city of <HI>Bal|davia,</HI>
and delivered her Goods there, and not
troubled them&s;elves to carry the goods up in Boats,
and &s;mall flat-bottomed Barges, which they have
there for the purpo&s;e: The Barges are built much
like our We&s;t-Country Barges, and &s;maller by
much. The&s;e Boats or Barges will carry about
ten or twelve Tuns: they &s;teer with a Rudder,
and have one Ma&s;t and Sail, as our Barges have;
the Sail is made of Cotton-cloth, and the Ropes
are made of the rind of <HI>Mangrove Trees;</HI> and in|&s;tead
of Anchors, they have wooden Crab-claws
or Kellocks. Anchors of Iron and Grapnels are
&s;carce in the&s;e Countries: Ropes and Cables of
Hemp are al&s;o &s;carce there, and good Fir-ma&s;ts
much wanted in all the&s;e Countries for their
Ships. The Ma&s;ts for their Ships are made of
white Cedar, and &s;uch like Wood; they are very
heavy and &s;hort-grained, and will break &s;hort. There
are not any Fir-trees growing in all the Land:
Good Workmen for the building of Ships are al|&s;o
much wanted here, and Seamen.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="76">
The &s;maller Boats which they have here are
Canoas, being cut out of the Body of a large
Tree, and &s;haped &s;omewhat like a Shallop at the
ends: &s;ome are thirty feet long, and built one
&s;trake of Board upon them, to rai&s;e them higher
on their &s;ides; they will carry near twenty Men
a piece: &s;ome are rowed with Oars, and &s;ome
are le&s;s, and rowed with Paddles: tho&s;e which
are walt, have a great Beam la&s;hed fa&s;t along each
&s;ide without Board, which keeps them from over-&s;etting.
The&s;e Boats are very ill built, for I &s;aw
not any one of them fit to row in any Sea-gate,
or for any Service, or to carry any Per&s;on of Qua|lity
in. The <HI>Indians</HI> are the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Slaves to
row them to and fro, and to do all manner of
labour; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not lay their Hands
to any thing in that nature, accounting it beneath
them to foul their Fingers with Work; for they
&s;corn to be Servants one to another, let the one be
never &s;o Potent, and the other not worth the Rags
which he weareth: yet he &s;corns to be a Servant
to him, and live in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The Land about the Harbour of <HI>Baldavia</HI> is of
a good height, and in Land it ri&s;eth in large
Hills: it is low by the Water-&s;ide, and the Shore
is &s;andy in &s;ome Bays, and broken &s;hatty bits of
glittering Rocks lilke Gold, lie &s;hatter'd along by
the Shore-&s;ide. All the whole Country is over|grown
with green Woods, as what I could &s;ee of it,
and by the Rivers &s;ides: there is no travelling in
the Woods, they are &s;o thick with Under-bru&s;h,
old rotten Trees, and Leaves, and &s;uch Tra&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="76">
The Harbour is near a Mile and an half broad,
and the Guns cannot command from one &s;ide to
the other: St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort is near two Miles from
the Harbours mouth; any Ship may come in and
beat them from their Guns, in St. <HI>Jago</HI> Fort, and
in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Sconce, which are on the South|we&s;t
&s;ide of the Harbour. After you are in, Saint
<HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort can do very little or no hurt at all to
your Ship, excepting it be accidental dropping
&s;hot. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no Plantation on this
South-we&s;t &s;ide, they only keep the Forts for
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that no forein Ship may come and
have the Port free to ride in, and Trade with
the Natives. The Harbour is like a Sound,
after one is within the Mouth of it toward the
South part.</P>
<P>Here grow many good Canes on the Shore-&s;ide,
&s;uch as are brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
which are called <HI>Bamboas;</HI> the&s;e are very &s;tiff
Sticks, firm and heavy; they grow among the
Trees on the &s;ides of the Woods like Vines, and
wind about the Trees: &s;ome are above twenty
feet long, and taper from the root to the top, like
an Angling-Rod.</P>
<P>All Commodities which come from <HI>Europe</HI> are
very dear here, and &s;carce, for they have none
brought to them, but by the way of <HI>Panama,</HI> and
by the River of <HI>Plata,</HI> which pa&s;s through &s;everal
Merchants hands before they come into the&s;e
parts, and the tran&s;porting of them from place to
place, is very chargeable. Many al&s;o are but of
little e&s;teem, here being &s;uch plenty of them:
<HI>French</HI> Hollands, Silks, <HI>Flanders-</HI> Laces, Silk-&s;tockings,
<PB N="110" REF="77">
Ribbaning, <HI>French</HI> Linnen, Looking-gla&s;&s;es,
and &s;uch like Commodities were much
enquired for here, and would have &s;old at great
Rates.</P>
<P>Gun-powder for Fowling-pieces, is worth a
piece of Eight <HI>per</HI> pound: and Bird-&s;hot is worth
two Ryals of Plate a pound, and a Ryal and an
half a pound. All Commodities of <HI>European</HI>
Workman&s;hip are of great worth here, as I under|&s;tand;
and believe that more Northerly on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Chile</HI> about <HI>Vale Parazo,</HI> and <HI>Coquinto,</HI>
and <HI>Areca,</HI> where there are more Inhabitants,
Commodities would bear a much greater price
than what I mention, and there would vent grea|ter
quantities: for Silver is more plentiful by
much in the&s;e parts than at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> they be|ing
nearer the Mines of the <HI>Poto&s;ea;</HI> for the
Silver of <HI>Poto&s;ea</HI> comes down to the Port of
<HI>Areca,</HI> and from thence it is carried to <HI>Lima</HI> by
Sea.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion that the mo&s;t advantageous
Trade in the World, might be made in the&s;e parts,
if it were but follow'd, and that leave were grant|ed
by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to Trade
freely in all their Ports and Coa&s;ts: for the Peo|ple
which inhabit there are very de&s;irous of a
Trade: but the Governours dur&s;t not permit it
without Orders, unle&s;s &s;uch Ships of force were
to go thither and Trade <HI>per</HI> force, and not take
notice of the Governours; which might be ea&s;ily
performed by four Ships of twenty and thirty
pieces of Ordnance a Ship; and I believe that
the Natives in the Southern parts of <HI>Chile,</HI> about
<PB N="111" REF="77">
<HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ono,</HI> and at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> would be
brought to a rich Trade of Gold, when once they
grew to be acquainted with tho&s;e that &s;hould be
employed on the de&s;ign, and they did but u&s;e
them civilly at the fir&s;t, and gain their loves;
which may be ea&s;ily done by giving them Knives,
Sci&s;&s;ars, Gla&s;&s;es, Beads, Combs, Hatchets, and
the like Commodities, and treat them kindly.
For what I under&s;tand by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were
aboard of me, they are Ma&s;ters of the Golden
part of the Country.</P>
<P>My intent being, if Weather permit me, to
&s;ail all along the Coa&s;t from <HI>Baldavia</HI> to the
Southward, till I come to the Streights-Mouth at
<HI>Cape De&s;iade.</HI> I came in great hopes to meet with
the <HI>Indians</HI> in &s;ome part of the Coa&s;ts, and to
Trade with them for Gold, and to find good Har|bours.
I re&s;olve al&s;o to &s;ee in at the I&s;lands of
<HI>Ca&s;tro</HI> and <HI>Or&s;ono,</HI> and try what I can find among
tho&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> who are &s;ettled there, and whe|ther
they live accordingly as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in|formed
me here.</P>

&s;aw the four I&s;les, called <HI>The Directions,</HI> which lie

in the Latitude of 52<HI>d.</HI> 42<HI>m.</HI> and at five of the

Leagues off; I &s;ounded, but could not get ground
at 70 Fathoms; I &s;aw <HI>Cape De&s;iade;</HI> it cleared up,
for the Fog was much on the Hills; the <HI>Cape</HI> was
<HI>E. S. E.</HI> of me, di&s;tant near eight Leagues: the
tops of the ragged Hills, or rocky Spires were
clouded with the flying Fog, &s;o as I could not &s;ee

ragged.</P>
<P>I &s;teered by <HI>Cape-pillar</HI> Ea&s;t and by South, the
Wind at We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, a fre&s;h gale; a great
humming Sea ran here, which came out of the

ground, which lieth at lea&s;t four Leagues from the

<P>As I came nearer the Streights-mouth, I rai&s;ed

<P>At any time if you have a de&s;ire to enter the

Rocks, and they be near together: the

<PB N="117" REF="80">
three, and it is peeked up like a Sugar-loaf:
the Sea breaks much on the&s;e I&s;les with We&s;terly
Winds, <HI>&amp;c. Cape-pillar</HI> is the &s;teep Point of Rocks
on the South-&s;ide of the Streights-mouth, at the
entring into the Streights: <HI>Cape De&s;iade</HI> is the
We&s;terly Point, for it falleth off from <HI>Cape-pillar</HI>
near South-we&s;t, and they are di&s;tant about two
Leagues one from another, which is the Face of
the Lands between the&s;e two Capes: for at the
Point of <HI>Cape De&s;iade,</HI> the Land on the South-&s;ide
of the Cape trents off to the South-&s;outh-ea&s;t|ward,
all high ragged rocky Mountains: what
I &s;aw of it, at the pitch of <HI>Cape De&s;iade,</HI> there lie
many &s;hatter'd Rocks which are above Water, and
&s;hew like the Ruins of old Hou&s;es: and there are
ledges of Rocks that are &s;unk, which lie near four
Leagues off of the Cape, We&s;t; the Sea breaks
much on them, and they are dangerous: they lie
in the Latitude of 53<HI>d.</HI> 10<HI>m.</HI> South, by my rec|koning;
I called the&s;e Rocks <HI>The Judges;</HI> they
are near ten Leagues di&s;tant South and by We&s;t
from the <HI>I&s;les of Direction,</HI> &s;o broad is the fir&s;t
opening of the Streights; for when you can but
once &s;ee the Land, to make it, there is no dan|ger;
but a Stranger that &s;hould pa&s;s out of the
South-&s;ea, and had not pa&s;&s;ed the Streights be|fore,
will find it very difficult to pa&s;s the Streights
from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t; for at the fir&s;t entring
into it out of the South-&s;ea, as we call it, there
are many Openings and Sounds on the North-&s;ide,
which &s;eem fairer for a pa&s;&s;age than the

the South-&s;ide, far aboard all along from <HI>Cape-pil|lar,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="81">

<P>The North-&s;ide of the Streights from <HI>Cape Vi|ctory,</HI>
all along to the Ea&s;tward to <HI>Cape Froward,</HI>
is all a ragged, rocky, mountainous, de&s;olate
Country; many high rocky I&s;lands, and &s;mall
Rocks, and &s;ucking Rocks lie on the North-&s;ide
of the Streights, at coming out of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI>
fifteen Leagues in di&s;tance into the Streights to
the Ea&s;tward. There al&s;o run great Sounds and
Waters into the North-Land, which &s;hew like a
pa&s;&s;age more than the Streights doth. There is
no &s;afety for a Ship to keep the North-&s;hore a|board
in this part; for here lie &s;o many I&s;lands
and Rocks, &s;o that if the Weather prove foggy
and thick, a Man may mi&s;take the right Chan|nel,
and &s;teer in among the broken I&s;lands and
Rocks, &s;o far as to endanger his Ship, if the
Wind be We&s;terly, and it is for the mo&s;t part of
the Winter there, very thick and foggy.</P>
<P>Here are many Sounds and Coves on the
North-&s;ide, between <HI>Cape-Victory</HI> and <HI>Cape Quad:</HI>
but how far they run into the Land, I know not.
I wanted a Sloop, or &s;ome other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, to
di&s;cover tho&s;e Sounds: and many other places in
the Streights, which I would gladly have &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 6. In <HI>Tue&s;day-bay</HI> and <HI>I&s;land-bay,</HI> there
grow thick &s;hrubby Bu&s;hes on the lower Land,
which have many Berries like Hurts growing on
them: the&s;e Bu&s;hes grow in a mo&s;&s;y loo&s;e Earth,
which lieth four or five Feet thick on the Rock;
<PB N="119" REF="81">
the&s;e Bu&s;hes will &s;erve for Fuel: there grows al&s;o
long &s;edgy Gra&s;s very thick; many Gee&s;e and
Ducks do make their Ne&s;ts and breed in it, and
other Sea-Fowl: here are Ducks, white and pied
brant-Gee&s;e, grey Gulls, Sea-Mews, Sea-Divers
and Penguins on the Water; I could not &s;ee any
People now, but &s;ome have been there; for I &s;aw
where they had made Fires, and an Arbour.
Here are Mu&s;cles and Limpets on the Rocks, but
as for other Fi&s;hes I &s;aw none. I rowed two Miles
up the Sound, and could have gone farther, but
it rained &s;o much, and blew &s;o hard, as I dur&s;t
not be ab&s;ent from the Ship; the Water is mighty
deep in the Sound. At night I got aboard, my
Seamen were joyful to &s;ee me, for they were a|fraid
that the Ship would have broke loo&s;e in the
time of my ab&s;ence. Much Rain to Night, and
Fogs, the Wind at We&s;t-&s;outh-we&s;t, a &s;hort gale
at Night; I rode fa&s;t on the &s;mooth Water, ha|ving
the Point on the North-we&s;t of me: Here is
a great deal of fre&s;h Water comes running in
&s;treams down the &s;ides of the bare rocky Moun|tains
into the &s;alt Water; many Whales &s;pouting
to and fro in the&s;e Bays and Sounds, and &s;ome Seals
on the Rocks: this part is very de&s;olate, and a
mere Chaos, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>At eight of the Clock this Evening, I anchored
before the place called <HI>Batchelors River,</HI> in nine
Fathom Water, clear &s;andy Ground, two Cables
length from the &s;hore. Here is very good clear
&s;andy-ground before the River, and good Ancho|ring
in &s;ix, or &s;even, or eight, or nine, or ten, or
eleven Fathom: a fine barth of &s;hore, and good Ri|ding
<PB N="120" REF="82">
with We&s;terly Winds, and Northerly: the
wor&s;t Wind is a South-Wind, for it blows right
on in this Reach; but there cannot go much Sea
here; for the Streight in this Reach is but two
Leagues broad. This <HI>Batchelors</HI> River is near five
Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Cape Quade,</HI> and two
Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of St. <HI>Jerom's</HI> Channel:
on the North-&s;ide of it, the Tide runs of an in|different
&s;trength in this place, both Ebb and
Flood; it &s;ets in and out of St. <HI>Jerom's</HI> Channel,
ri&s;ing and falling about eight or nine Feet per|pendicular:
here is not above ten Foot Water at
a High-water, at the going in of <HI>Batchelor</HI>'s River.
This River is a good Harbour for Barks and
Sloops, or the like. This River lieth in a Valley,
and a fine Grove of green Trees grows on the We&s;t
Point: At the entrance here is very good fre&s;h
Water, and a good place to Wood at. The <HI>In|dian</HI>
People or Natives frequent this place often;
for here are many Arbours, which are their Hou&s;es:
Calm Weather to Night, and Foggy; I rode fa&s;t,
the Ship being moored.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>January</HI> 8. Calm Weather, and a fine
warm Sun-&s;hine; This Morning at Day-light, I
went in my Boat with twenty Men into <HI>Batchelor</HI>'s
River, and rowed four Miles up the Creek, or
River, which was as far as the Boat could go; the
Water being high: the River ends in a &s;mall
Creek, coming out of a Lake of fre&s;h Water, in a
Valley among&s;t the Hills: we made the Boat
fa&s;t, and marched all into the Land five or &s;ix
Miles, being &s;top'd from going further, by Hills
ri&s;ing very &s;teep, and Mountains, and impenetrable
<PB N="121" REF="82">
Woods: we made &s;everal Fires, but could not &s;ee
any &s;ign of them &s;o far in the Land. No Bea&s;t
or other Creature to be &s;een; many &s;mall &s;treams
of fre&s;h Water come running from the &s;nowy
Mountains, with great Falls from the &s;teep Rocks:
we looked in many places of the Earth, and in
the &s;treams of Water for Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but found
none, nor any other Metal of Mineral: Here
grow on the Bu&s;hes many &s;mall red Berries, much
like Hurts, very good to eat; the Gra&s;s-Land is
very loo&s;e and Boggy: the Rocks are a kind of
white Marble; the Trees like tho&s;e at <HI>Port Fa|men;</HI>
here are &s;mall Pepper-trees. To Night I got
on Board; Calm Weather: I rode fa&s;t with the
Ship.</P>

we made the be&s;t of our way to get into <HI>Port
Famen</HI> Here we had Fi&s;hes from the Shore to Fi&s;h
our Main-ma&s;t: At twelve a Clock we Anchored
in nine Fathom Waaer. This place afforded what
we wanted, as very good large Trees for Fi&s;hes:
good Water, good wild Fowl, good fi&s;h, like
Mullets, and large Smelts. here we fitted our
Ships Ma&s;ts, and Rigging as well as we could;
Careen'd her, and filled our Casks with good
fre&s;h Water, and took as much Wood aboard, as
we thought fit.</P>

<HI>January</HI> 16. Fair Weather, and little Wind,
We&s;terly. This Morning the Lieutenant was or|dered
to go up with the Boat in <HI>Segars</HI> River, as
high as he could with convenience, and to &s;ee for
<HI>Indians:</HI> He went up about nine Miles, but could
nor get higher with the Boat, by rea&s;on of the
Trunk-timber, and &s;hoaline&s;s in the Water. So I
landed, and went up two Miles by Land to &s;ee for

him come a-board with me, but he would not; as

he had been a slave to &s;ome other <HI>Indians,</HI> and
had run away from them, and was travelling

Smelts; Smelts of twenty Inches long, and eight
Inches about.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day <HI>February</HI> 8. Fair Weather, Wind

From <HI>Cape De&s;iade</HI> to <HI>Elizabeths</HI> I&s;land, there is
Wood and fre&s;h Water plenty; but from <HI>Eliza|beths</HI>
I&s;land, to <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI> Wood and fre&s;h

Harbour for &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, on the North-&s;ide, and
at the South-end of a great deep Bay, thwart of
<HI>Elizabeths</HI> I&s;land; the entrance of this Harbour
is not a Bow-&s;hot from &s;ide to &s;ide: I &s;ounded
it, and there was twelve foot Water at a low
Water; but within there was three Fathom Wa|ter,
at low Water: from the entrance of this
Harbour to the upper end of it. is about &s;even

good and well-ta&s;ted; but I &s;aw no <HI>Indians,</HI>

went into another Harbour, a Mile to the South|ward
of the &s;econd Narrow on the North|&s;hore,

it is very broad within, and there is great &s;tore of
Sea-Crabs.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>February</HI> 11. Fair Weather, Wind va|riable.
This day the Captain ordered me to go
with the Pinnace, and di&s;cover the North-&s;hore,

part of the South; and to go to the fir&s;t Narrow,
<PB N="125" REF="84">

again to the Boat, and there we pitched a
Tent to lie in, and lay all Night; and at High|water
we &s;et the &s;ame thwart a Pond of Water,
and there it &s;tood until Low-water; then we hal|led
the Pond all over, and haled a-&s;hore about
700 good and large Fi&s;h like Mullets. This
Land is very dry, barren Land, and nothing to
be &s;een in it worth the Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12. Fair Weather, Wind Northerly.
This Morning I went over to the North-&s;hore,
and there I fell with a fine &s;andy Bay; I &s;ounded
it, and had 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Fathom Water a|bove
half a Mile from the Shore. This Bay is be|tween
the &s;econd Narrow, and <HI>Cape Gregory;</HI> clo&s;e
under <HI>Cape Gregory;</HI> this Cape is about five or

we pitched our Tent, and lay all Night.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 13. Fair Weather, and a fre&s;h gale of

<PB N="126" REF="85">
there I landed, and haled up the Boat; and &s;earch|ed
about to &s;ee if we could fall with any Guns,
or other Trade. One of the Men found an Iron
Commander for &s;ome Ships Poop: one of tho&s;e
Anchors were twelve Foot long in the Shank,
and the other two were eleven Foot a piece, and
they were all <HI>spani&s;h</HI> Anchors. The Land here is
barren, dry Land, and affords neither Wood, nor
fre&s;h Water; and for the &s;pace of five, or &s;ix Miles
about, the land is full of Rats; they have Holes
in the Ground like Coney-burroughs: their Food

Night coming on, we here pitched our
Tent, and lay all Night; here are very good
&s;andy Bays on the North-&s;ide, all the way betwixt

<P><PB N="145" REF="99">
The fourth that Attemped it was <HI>William Bar|rans,</HI>
a well Experienced Navigator and Arti&s;t,
&s;ent out of <HI>Holland</HI> by Prince <HI>Morrice</HI> in the
Year 1606. He &s;ailed into the Waygates, but
being entred, he found the &s;ame Incumbrance
with Ice that <HI>Pett</HI> and <HI>Jackman</HI> had done before;
&s;o ta&s;ting of the Water, and finding of it fre&s;h,
which neither <HI>Burrough, Pett,</HI> nor <HI>Jackman</HI> had
ob&s;erved; he returned without any hope or pro|bability
of a Pa&s;&s;age that way: but this not di&s;|couraging
him, he re&s;olved a &s;econd Adventure
to the Northward of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> to &s;ee what
might be Performed that way.</P>
<P>So in the Year 1607. he &s;et forward, and
arrived on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> in the Lat.
of 73. where he met with Ice; and &s;o coa&s;ted
the Shore till he came to the Lat. of 76. where he
could get no farther, and by the Ice was there
driven on Shore, and his Ship broke in peices by
it, and he confined to Winter there, where they
all indured the greate&s;t extremity of Cold that
ever Mortals did: the Winter being pa&s;t they
with difficulty, in two Boats, got to <HI>Cola</HI> in <HI>Lap|land,</HI>
but before their arrival there <HI>William Bar|rans</HI>
dyed, to the great grief of all his Com|pany.</P>
<P>The next that Attempted it, was that famous
Di&s;coverer of our own Nation Mr. <HI>Henry Hud&s;on,</HI>
in the Year 1610. but he being di&s;heartned by
the Voyage of <HI>Barrans,</HI> attempted but little.</P>
<P>So the thought of a Pa&s;&s;age by the North-Ea&s;t
was wholly laid a&s;ide, till of late within this
Year or two &s;ome Novile Accidents happening;
<PB N="146" REF="100">
the Opinion of the North-Ea&s;t was received in
&s;ome, and &s;omething relating thereunto was
printed in the <HI>Tran&s;actions</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></P>
<P>Now will I come to the Rea&s;ons of that in|duced
me to believe there was a probability of a
Pa&s;&s;age, and then the cau&s;e of my undertaking
of the &s;aid Voyage.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t Rea&s;on was grounded on the Opinion
of <HI>William Barrans</HI> before &s;poke of; which was,
that <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> and <HI>Greenland</HI> being 200
Leagues di&s;tance between one and the other,
that if he had Steered away North-Ea&s;t from the
North Cape, which would have brought him in
the mid-way betwixt the two Lands, that then
he might have probably found an open Sea, free
from Ice, and &s;o Con&s;equently a Pa&s;&s;age; and in
that Opinion he remained to his dying day; for
he did verily believe that the Ice was not to be
met off of either Shore more than 20 Leagues,
and the re&s;t to be free and open, and that his
being too near the Shore of <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> was
the cau&s;e of his meeting &s;o much Ice, which was
the overthrow of his Voyage, and if he had
lived, he had purpo&s;ely intended another Voyage,
and to have &s;ailed the mid-way.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on that made me believe a
Pa&s;&s;age, was a Letter &s;ent out of <HI>Holland;</HI> which
is Publi&s;hed in the <HI>Tran&s;actions</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI>
which affirmeth, the Grand <HI>Zar</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covia</HI> had
cau&s;ed a particular Survey of the Land of <HI>Nova
Z<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">mbla&punc;</HI> and that they had found it to be no
I&s;land, but to joyn to the main Land of <HI>Tarta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ia&punc;</HI>
and that to the Northward of it was a free
and open Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="100">
The third was a Journal, Printed in <HI>Holland,</HI>
of a Voyage from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> wherein
the Ship was ca&s;t away upon <HI>Corea,</HI> a Penin&s;ula
of <HI>China,</HI> where by the Natives they were made
Slaves, The Relator having been there 16
years, at la&s;t e&s;caped to <HI>Japan,</HI> and writ this
Journal, wherein among&s;t other Ob&s;ervations
he Relates this; that in a Bay on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Corea,</HI> there doth at &s;everal times drive in dead
Whales with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Harping Irons in
them, which if true had been a great Argument
of a Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The fourth was a Relation of Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph
Moxons,</HI> who being in <HI>Holland</HI> above 20 years
&s;ince, heard a <HI>Dutchman</HI> relate (as he did believe
the real Matter of Fact) that he had been un|der
the Pole it &s;elf; and that it was as warm there
as it was at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in Summer time.</P>
<P>The fifth was a Relation of one Captain
<HI>Goulden,</HI> who had made above thirty Voyages to
<HI>Greenland,</HI> and this he did relate to his Maje&s;ty;
that being at <HI>Greenland</HI> &s;ome twenty Years ago,
he was in Company with two <HI>Hollanders</HI> to the
Ea&s;tward of Edges I&s;land, and that the Whales
not appearing on the Shore, the two <HI>Hollanders</HI>
were re&s;olved to go farther Northerly, and to
Fi&s;h among&s;t the Ice; &s;o they departed from him
and went to the Northward, and in a Fortnights
time returned to him again, and gave it out,
that they had &s;ailed unto the Lat. of 89. that
was within one Degree of the Pole, and that
they did meet with no Ice, but a free and open
Sea, and that there run a very hollow grown Sea

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">

<PB N="148" REF="102">
like that of the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;ca.</HI> Mr. <HI>Goulden</HI> be|ing
not &s;atisfied with the bare Relation, they
produced him four Journals out of the two
Ships, which te&s;tified the &s;ame, and that they
all agreed within four minutes one of the other.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth Inducement that made me believe
there was a Pa&s;&s;age, was a Relation from the
&s;ame Captain <HI>Goulden,</HI> which was, that all the
drift Wood that they found at <HI>Greenland,</HI> was
eaten with a Sea-Worm to the very Heart, which
if &s;o, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity come out of a Hot
Climate; for Experience &s;heweth, that the Worm
biteth in no Cold Country, therefore it could
not be &s;uppo&s;ed that it came from any other
Country than <HI>Jedzo, Japan,</HI> or &s;ome Land there|about.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh Argument was another Narration
Printed in the <HI>Tran&s;actions,</HI> of two Ships of late
that had attempted the Pa&s;&s;age, &s;ailed 300
Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and
had after pro&s;ecuted the Voyage, had there not
a difference aro&s;e betwixt the Undertakers and the
<HI>Ea&s;t-India-Company,</HI> again&s;t who&s;e Intere&s;t it was
to &s;uffer it to be found out; &s;o they being a Body,
and more powerful than the other, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;even were the main Arguments, though
I had many more, that Converted me into the
Opinion of there being a po&s;&s;ibility of a Pa&s;&s;age
to the Northward of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> to <HI>China</HI>
and <HI>Japan;</HI> the&s;e being as I &s;uppo&s;ed, or as any
Man would have done, if he had well con&s;ider|ed
them, to be Matter of Fact, and no Fables.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="102">
Be&s;ides the&s;e Arguments, I had &s;ome grounded
upon Rea&s;on and Nature, which &s;eemed to be
a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the De&s;ign of the Attempt, &s;uppo&s;ing
the afore&s;aid Arguments to be true, and there
being no Land nor Ice in the way as and Ob&s;tacle
to hinder it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, That being near the North-Pole
in the Summer time, it might be as warm as un|der
the <HI>Artick</HI> or <HI>Antartick</HI> Circle, or warmer
than with us in the Winter time; for under the
Pole it &s;elf, in <HI>June</HI> the Sun being 23 degrees
high, and having no Depre&s;&s;ion towards the Ho|rizon,
but always &s;wimming about at the &s;ame
hight, might illuminate that part of the Hemi&s;|phere
with more heat than it doth ours in Win|ter,
when he is no more then 15 degrees high,
when he is at the highe&s;t, that is on the Meri|dian,
and not more than eight Hours above the
Horizon; or that it might be as hot as any place
near either Polar Circle, becau&s;e there the Sun
hath a Declination toward the Horizon, and &s;o
the Atmo&s;phere hath almo&s;t as much time to cool,
as it hath to heat, which under the Pole &s;hould
have no intermi&s;&s;ion. And one Argument to fa|vour
this Opinion, was the Relation of mo&s;t
<HI>Greenland</HI> Traders, who affirm, that the farther
North they go on the Coa&s;t of that Land, that
they meet with more green Herbs and Gra&s;s,
than they do to the Southward, and con&s;equent|ly
more Deer.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was (that which I mo&s;t feared)
which was foggy Weather, which I did imagin,
if it &s;hould happen, it could not at the &s;ame
<PB N="150" REF="103">
time blow hard; becau&s;e it is u&s;ual in all other
Climates, when Wind happeneth, to di&s;per&s;e the
Fog; &s;o that if it &s;hould &s;o happen, one might lie
by, or make little way till Wind came that one
might &s;ee before them.</P>
<P>The third was the Solution of a Doubt that
mo&s;t men had fancied, which was, that if one
came near the Pole, the Septenteral Declination
of the Needle of the Compa&s;s &s;hould be quite
taken away, which would of nece&s;&s;ity follow if
the Pole of the World, and the Pole of the
Magnet were all one; which I am certain is not,
but is placed &s;o far off, that one might go under
the Pole of the World, if Land or Ice did not
hinder, with this &s;uppo&s;ition, that one mu&s;t know
where the Pole Magnetical is, to allow the Va|riation
that will there happen.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered all the&s;e Arguments and
Rea&s;ons, with many more I met with, which
will be too tedious to Relate; and the po&s;&s;ibility
of a Pa&s;&s;age being now imprinted in my Mind
and Inclination, I do intend to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons
in &s;hort, that induced me to undertake the &s;aid
Voyage.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, That the King, whom God Pre|&s;erve,
&s;hould Rcap the Honour and Glory there|of,
and his Subjects the Profit.</P>
<P>Secondly, There being no Actions within the
Hemi&s;phere of His Maje&s;ties Dominions wherein
any vacancy was, but all being &s;upplyed, I cho&s;e,
rather than to be Idle, to apply my &s;elf to His
Maje&s;ty for the Pro&s;ecution of the De&s;ign; and
being advi&s;ed to it by a great many of the be&s;t
<PB N="151" REF="103">
Merchants of the City of <HI>London;</HI> where, after
divers con&s;ultations with them, and the Rea&s;ons
and Arguments before-mentioned being debated,
it was by many thought Practicable, and by
more thought Profitable to the Nation: the par|ticulars
to relate would &s;well into a con&s;iderable
Volume.</P>
<P>The third Rea&s;on was peculiar to my &s;elf,
though when known, to the U&s;e and Benefit of all
Mankind; which was, that having for &s;ome years
pa&s;t framed an Hypothe&s;is of the motion of the
two Magnetical Poles, for two &s;uch there be;
and by the Ob&s;ervations of all, or mo&s;t that
writ of that Subject, with my own Ob&s;ervation,
and co&s;tly Experiment upon a great many Places
of the Superficies of the Terre&s;trial Globe; I
having found out their Motion very near, and
thereby the Inclination of the Magnetical Needle
under the Horizon, in all Latitudes, and all
Longitudes; and Variation of the Compa&s;s may
be found in any place in this World, without
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other Luminary. But not being
&s;o fully &s;atisfied as I might be, if I could come
&s;o near the Pole as was &s;uppo&s;ed, it prompted
my Inclination, as far as any other Argument
whatever, to Attempt this Voyage.</P>
<P>So having all the&s;e Rea&s;ons that there was a
Pa&s;&s;age, and Rea&s;ons for me to unertake it; I
advanced. The fir&s;t &s;tep to it was, I drew a Polar
Draught, whereing I traced all tho&s;e Navigators
that had Attempted the North-Ea&s;t, which I
pre&s;ented to His Maje&s;ty, and Royal Highne&s;s,
and applyed my &s;elf to them with the Rea&s;ons
<PB N="152" REF="104">
afore&s;aid: which after their Royal Con&s;ideration,
and Con&s;ult with many Merchants, and Seamen,
that had u&s;ed to Sail Northward; and if thought
by all fea&s;able, His Maje&s;ty was Graciou&s;ly
plea&s;ed to grant me the <HI>Speedwell</HI> Frigot, to be
Manned and Victualled at his Royal Charge,
with all other Appurtenances thereunto belong|ing.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e in all Attempts of this Nature it
was not Convenient to venture one Ship alone,
for the many Accidents that are incident to a
&s;ingle Ship in an Enterprize of this Nature;</P>

<P>The&s;e Eight Honourable Per&s;ons, at their own
proper Charge, bought a Pink, called the <HI>Pro|&s;perous,</HI>
of the Burthen of a Hundred and twenty
Tuns, fitted her to Sea, Men, Amunition, Pro|vi&s;ion,
and Merchandize, which was &s;uch as
was Rea&s;onably purpo&s;ed to Vend on the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> or at <HI>Japan,</HI> if a Pa&s;&s;age had been
found.</P>
<P>Now the Ships being fitting out, the <HI>Speedwell</HI>
at <HI>Deptford</HI> in the King's Yard, where the Builder,
<PB N="153" REF="104">
Mr. <HI>John Si&s;h,</HI> took no ordinary Care in Strength|ning
her, and in her Shething, which was as
well performed as in any Ship that ever &s;ailed on
the Sea. Thus being fitted, I was to &s;atisfie mo&s;t
People the Advantage to our Nation that would
accrue, if there was a Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Advantage that I purpo&s;ed, was, that
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> it being a cold Cli|mate,
we might Vend our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, which
now is grown a Drug; and certain it is that they
wear Cloth which is &s;ent them from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and
<HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> which before it arrive at their Hands
mu&s;t needs be very Dear in the Price; &s;o if one
could come on their Coa&s;t, one might Vend a
great deal more, and abundance Cheaper.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Advantage, as would have been,
that in &s;ix Weeks one might have &s;ailed to <HI>Japan,</HI>
which in the other Way is nine Months; and
the Pa&s;&s;age that way being as hazardous and
perillous as this would have been, if there had
been any Pa&s;&s;age by the North-Ea&s;t; for by the
South way, all the way betwixt <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Ja|pan</HI>
are an innumerable Company of Sands, Sholes,
and I&s;lands, where many Ships are yearly lo&s;t, and
all that way one mu&s;t turn up to Windward, and
be in perpetual fear of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whom if
we meet, they do their utmo&s;t indeavours to De|&s;troy

bore up round to bring to upon the other Tack,
but our Ship not wearing round, run on a ledge
of Rocks, there &s;tuck fa&s;t, but Captain <HI>Flawes</HI>
Ship got clear, wearing more rounder: we fired
&s;everal Guns to give Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> notice of our
di&s;tre&s;s, we u&s;ed all means po&s;&s;ible to get her off,
by carrying out a Ha&s;&s;er and Anchor, and &s;taving
of Water and Beer, and throwing Provi&s;ion over
Board, but could not get the Ship off, for the
Water did Ebb, and the Ship Sued above 3 Foot;
but when the Flood came it brought a great Sea
with it, and the Ship beat very hard: we u&s;ed
all means to heave her off, but could not, and
the Ship making Water more than we could
Pump; with that we cut our Ma&s;ts by the Board,
and &s;ent our Yaul unto the Shore to di&s;cover
&s;ome place to Land, at who&s;e return aboard
brought word that there was landing, with that
we got up Bread out of the Bread Room, and
brought it up into the great Cabbin: and the
Carpenter made ready to &s;ave &s;ome Tools, and
nece&s;&s;aries to Rebuild our Long-Boat to &s;ave our
lives, if &s;o nece&s;&s;itated, that Captain <HI>Flawes</HI>
&s;hould not return to us. So about 12 at Noon
we got all our Men a&s;hore, except two which
were drowned in the Pinnace, by a Sea which
broke into her, ju&s;t as &s;he put off from the Ship
&s;ide: having Bread, Powder, and Provi&s;ions in
her, and all lo&s;t with the Pinnace. Al&s;o, to
our great grief, having nothing but the Long-Boat,
<PB N="167" REF="111">
to tru&s;t in, to &s;ave our lives, which could
not carry above 30 Men of 70. We u&s;ed all
means to &s;ave Bread, but the Ship filling up to the
upper Deck, we were forced to leave her, having
&s;aved but two Bags of Bread, with &s;ome pieces
of Pork, and a little Chee&s;e: this being all on
Shore, we carried our Provi&s;ions, and other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
upon a Hill, where came to vi&s;it us one
of the Natives, which was a Prodigious great white
Bear, which one of our Men &s;hot at, and as we
&s;uppo&s;ed hit her, which made her run away:
with that we made all ha&s;t to build us a Tent to
keep us from the cold, and to keep our Provi|&s;ions
dry, having &s;aved Canvas for the purpo&s;e,
which we laid over Oars and Spars, and threw
up a Trench of Earth round us, to pre&s;erve us
from Wild Bea&s;ts; but all this time indured much
cold, mo&s;t of our Men being wet, and having
no firing; therefore all our Hopes and Prayers
were that God would &s;end us the Ship a&s;hore.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 30. A fre&s;h Gale, and very foggy,
with a great Sea; our Ship began to &s;plit, and
much Wreck came a&s;hore; &s;o that we got Oars,
Spars and Deals, to build us Tents, and firing,
of which we &s;aved as much as we could; but the
Weather proved very foggy to our great grief,
being we could not expect Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> as
long as the Fog continued. The Wind at We&s;t-north-we&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 1. The Wind at North-we&s;t a
fre&s;h Gale, the Ship brake in pieces, &s;o that we
had much Wreck came a&s;hore, and Provi&s;ions,
which we indeavoured to &s;ave with much pains
<PB N="168" REF="112">
and trouble, the Sea breaking much on the Shore,
and the Weather very cold and foggy. We &s;aved
two Casks of Flower, &s;ome Brandy, and a Butt
of Beer, and a Cask of Oil: the Flower did us
great kindne&s;s to &s;ave our Bread, for we made of
the Flower Pan-Cakes, and Pudding, and baked
Cakes on Stones, to our great refre&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 2. The Wind at We&s;t, and very
foggy; we &s;aved more Flower, Butter, and a
few pieces of Beef and Pork, the Cask being
Staved. The Gunneras he was &s;aving of Provi|&s;ion,
there came a great White Bear to him,
which he &s;hot at, and fell'd her down, but &s;he
ro&s;e again and at him; with that there came
more Men and fired at her: &s;he was a very great
one, and very Fat, and the Fle&s;h very good, and
look'd delicate, and Eat well.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 8. The Wind at We&s;t-north-we&s;t;
a very great Fog, and all our Men in
great de&s;pair of our &s;eeing Captain <HI>Flawes:</HI> we
beginning to con&s;ider our mo&s;t mi&s;erable Condi|tion,
and contriving how to &s;ave our Lives; the
Long-boat not being able to carry above 30 Men,
and a Deck built on her, and her Wa&s;t rai&s;ed;
with that we concluded to lengthen her 12 Foot,
and to carry all our Men; but upon con&s;iderati|on
of wanting Materials, and the Carpenters bad
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Men would not agree to have her
cut a &s;under, for fear &s;he could not be lengthened;
but were willing to Travel by Land towards the
Waygates, in hopes to find &s;ome <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Lodges.
With that we began to rai&s;e her Wa&s;t, and build
a Deck, the Weather continuing very foggy till
<PB N="169" REF="112">
<HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, at which time we e&s;pyed
Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> to our great joy; with that we
made pre&s;ently a great Fire, and &s;ent our Yaul
to meet him, who immediately &s;aw our Fire and
&s;teered into us, and &s;ent his Boat to help to bring
off our Men; with that we broke up our new

<PB N="185" REF="120">
<HEAD>Now, after the JOURNAL, I do
intend to &s;hew my Conceptions of
the &s;aid Voyage, and a true Re|lation
of our Mi&s;carriage; with
&s;ome Ob&s;ervations made in the &s;aid
Voyage.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t was the following the Opini|on
of <HI>William Barrans,</HI> that was to
&s;teer directly North-ea&s;t from the
North Cape, and to fall in the mid|way
betwixt <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Nova Zembla:</HI> &s;o
having made the Land to the We&s;tward of the
North Cape, the 19. Day of <HI>June,</HI> I &s;teered a|way
North-ea&s;t by Compa&s;s, which was not &s;o
much by the true Cour&s;e, becau&s;e of the variati|on
that is there We&s;terly; and the 22. Day at
Noon we &s;aw the main Body of Ice, being in
the Lat. of 76 <HI>d.</HI> and about 60 Leagues to the
Ea&s;tward of <HI>Greenland.</HI> At the fir&s;t &s;eeing of
Ice, I did imagin it had been the Ice that joyned
to <HI>Greenland;</HI> and that if I went more Ea&s;terly
there might be a free Sea; &s;o I ran clo&s;e by the
Ice, it lying away. Ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t; and We&s;t-north-we&s;t,
and every League, or le&s;s, that we
<PB N="186" REF="121">
ran, we met with a Cape of Ice; &s;o when we
were about that, we could &s;ee no Ice to the
Northward; &s;o &s;tanding in North-ea&s;t, &s;ometimes
two Gla&s;&s;es, that is one hour, we could &s;ee more
Ice a Head, and then we were forced to go out
the &s;ame way we came in, and thus I continued
Coa&s;ting the Ice, &s;ometimes with great hopes of
a clear Sea, and then again di&s;heartened by &s;ee|ing
more Ice; till at la&s;t I had no hopes at all,
which was when I &s;aw the Land of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI>
and the Ice joyn to it. So here the Opinion of
<HI>William Barrans</HI> was Confuted, and all the
re&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Relations, which certainly are
all forged abu&s;ive Pamphlets; as al&s;o the Relati|ons
of our own Countrymen. But certainly, if
Men did really con&s;ider the many individual
dangers and mi&s;chiefs that comes upon the
broaching of &s;uch untruths, they would never do
it; for I do now verily believe that if there be no
Land to the Northward of the Lat. of 80 <HI>d.</HI> that
the Sea that is there is all frozen, and always
continueth &s;o; for I that could get no farther
than 76 <HI>d.</HI> found it &s;o frozen without intermi&s;&s;i|on;
and &s;ome of the Ice that we &s;aw, that was
on the main Body of it, had been conveyed 10
Degrees more Southward, would have taken
&s;ome Centuries of Years to Thaw it: for the
loo&s;e Ice that lay about the Edges of the main
Body, was not more than a Foot thick in &s;ome
pieces above the Superficies of the Water, and
the re&s;t of the Cake that was &s;unk, was more
than 18 Foot below. So I conclude that tho&s;e
va&s;t Mountains that were on the main Body were
<PB N="187" REF="121">
all on Shore, as of nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t, if they
hold the &s;ame proportion; and con&s;idering the
&s;hallowne&s;s of the Water, which I found all along
the Ice, which in the mid-way between the two
Lands, I found to be no more than 70 Fathom,
was doubtle&s;s a &s;ign that to the Northward is
Land, and that the main Body of Ice that lyeth
cru&s;ted about the Shore, may be 20 Leagues or
more, and that <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> and <HI>Greenland</HI> are
the &s;ame Continent; for if there had been any
Pa&s;&s;age, there would have been &s;ome Current,
which I could never, or very hardly find to be
any, and the little that was run Ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t
along the Ice, which is nothing el&s;e but a &s;mall
Tide which ri&s;eth &s;ome 8 Foot. Thus the Ice
having been an ob&s;tacle in our way, as al&s;o the
cau&s;e of my coming &s;o far to the Ea&s;tward,
which before I never intended.</P>
<P>I will come to the misfortune that happened
to us in the lo&s;s of our Ship: which was thus,
being among&s;t the Ice the 29. Day of <HI>June</HI> in the
Morning, we had like to have been inclo&s;ed in
it: it proving likewi&s;e foggy Weather, I &s;tood
out to the Southward, thinking to lye there till
fairer Weather, or to &s;pend &s;ome time to the
Southward, and then come up to the Ice again,
to &s;ee if there might be any alteration in it as to
its removal either Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, or south;
but all this Day it proved foggy dirty Weahter,
the Wind being at We&s;t: &s;o we lay South-&s;outh-we&s;t
with the Stem, and by our Judgment and
Reckoning, the We&s;termo&s;t Land of <HI>Nova Zem|bla</HI>
bore from us Ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, that was 4 Points
<PB N="188" REF="122">
under our Lee Bow. But &s;uch was our misfor|tune
that it proved not &s;o, for about 10 of the
Clock Captain <HI>Flawes,</HI> being upon our Weather
Quarter, fired a Gun and bore to me, and called
out that there was Ice a Head; then I looking
out a Head, &s;aw &s;omething white ju&s;t under the
Bow, which pre&s;ently I perceived to be a breath,
and no Ice; now if I had &s;taied with the Ship,
Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> being to Windward, I &s;hould
have been on Board of him, and then certainly
we had been both lo&s;t, &s;o I was forced to bear
up with hope that I might get clear of it; but
the Ship being a great while wearing &s;truck on
the Rock, her Head lying to Seaward, which if
it had not, but that the Broad&s;ide had been to
the Sea we had all peri&s;hed without Gods great
mercy: Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> in the mean time (being
a &s;horter Ship) wore round, and came clo&s;e un|der
our Stern, and with great Providence e&s;caped,
and stood off to Sea: here we lay beating on the
Rock in mo&s;t cruel manner for the &s;pace of 3 or 4
hours, u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible means to &s;ave her, but all in
vain, for it blew &s;o hard that it was impo&s;&s;ible to
carry out an Anchor capable to do us any &s;ervice,
though we had an opportunity to carry a &s;mall
Anchor, and warp to hall&punc; another out by, which
&s;ignified but little: the Ship all this while lay, and
at the end of 4 or 5 hours we &s;aw Land clo&s;e un|der
our Stern, to the great amazement of us all,
which before we could not &s;ee for the foggy
Weather; &s;o I commanded the Men to get out
our Boats before our Ma&s;t came by the Board,
which was done. I &s;ent the Boat&s;wain toward
<PB N="189" REF="122">
the Shore in the Pinnace, to &s;ee if there was any
po&s;&s;ibility of landing, which I much feared, be|cau&s;e
the Sea ran &s;o high. In half an hour he
returned with this an&s;wer, that it was impo&s;&s;ible
to &s;ave a Man, the Sea ran &s;o high, and the Snow
being in high Clifts on Shore was unacce&s;&s;ible,
which was but bad tidings: &s;o then it was high
time to think on the &s;afety of our Souls, and we
went all together to Prayers, to be&s;eech God to
have Mercy on us, for now nothing but indi|vidual
ruin appeared before our Eyes: after
Prayers being done it proved a little clearer
Weather; and I looking over the Stern &s;aw a
&s;mall Beach directly with the Stern of the Ship,
where I thought might be &s;ome po&s;&s;ibility of
landing; &s;o I &s;ent the Pinnace again with &s;ome
Men to be landed, but they dur&s;t not venture on
Shore; &s;o I &s;ent the Long-Boat with &s;ome 20
Men to Land, who attempted it, and got &s;afe on
Shore; &s;o they in the Pinnace &s;eeing that, fol|lowed
them and their Men likewi&s;e, and both
returned on Board again: now the Men on the
Shore &s;ent to me de&s;ire &s;ome Fire-Arms and Am|munition,
for there was many Bears on Shore; &s;o
I cau&s;ed to be put into the Pinnace two Barrels
of Powder that we had &s;aved dry, before the
Ship was belged, and &s;ome &s;mall Arms, and &s;ome
Provi&s;ion, with my own Papers, and Mony;
but as &s;he put off from the Ship &s;ide, a Sea over|&s;et
her, &s;o that all was lo&s;t with the life of one
Man, by name <HI>John Bo&s;man,</HI> being Coopers
Mate, and &s;everal others taken up for dead; the
Long-Boat being then on Shore to Land more
<PB N="190" REF="123">
Men, and they hearing us call from aboard,
(when as then we could not &s;ee the Shore) they
came on Board and &s;aved the Men, but the Pin|nace
was all broke to pieces, which was no &s;mall
grief to us; &s;o the Long-Boat being on Board,
and the Sea running prodigious high, the Boat|&s;wain
and &s;ome others would compel me and
the Lieutenant to leave the Ship, &s;aying that it
was impo&s;&s;ible for the Boat to live any longer in
that Sea, and that they had rather be drowned
than I; but de&s;iring me when I came on Shore
(if it were po&s;&s;ible) to &s;end the Boat again for
them: &s;o I being half way on Shore the Ship
over-&s;et; &s;o I made all the ha&s;t po&s;&s;ible to Land
them Men I had in the Boat, and having landed
them I went off to the Ship again to &s;ave tho&s;e
poor Men that had been &s;o kind to me before:
&s;o with great hazard I got with the Boat to the
Quarter of the Ship, and they came down the
Ladder into the Boat, only one Man who was
left for dead, which was one that had been ca&s;t
away in the Pinnace, who&s;e name was <HI>Alexander
Frazor,</HI> a very pretty Saylor. So I returned to
the Shore and got &s;afe to Land, though very wet
and cold; &s;o we hauled up the Boat on Shore,
and went up the Land about a flight&s;hoot, where
our Men were making a Fire, and a Tent with
Canvas and Oars, which we had &s;aved for that
Purpo&s;e; &s;o we lay all that Night very cold, wet,
and weary. The next Morning the Man that
we left on Board recovered, and got unto the
Mizen-Top; for that Ma&s;t we left &s;tanding when
we came away, the other we had cut all down.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="123">
The Ship laboured and beat violently, but it
blew &s;o hard, and the Sea ran &s;o high that it
was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave him; &s;o the Weather con|tinuing
blowing, with extreme Fogs, and with
Fro&s;t and Snow, and all the ill compacted Wea|ther
that could be imagined together. We built
more Tents to pre&s;erve our &s;elves, and the Ship
breaking in pieces came all a&s;hore to the &s;ame
place where we landed, which &s;erved for &s;helter
and Firing; be&s;ides there came to us &s;ome
Hog&s;heads of Flower, and Brandy good &s;tore,
which was no little Comfort in our great Extre|mity.
Here we lay betwixt hope and de&s;pair,
hoping for fair Weather that Captian <HI>Flawes</HI>
might find us, which was impo&s;&s;ible that ever he
&s;hould do if it continued foggy; and &s;ome de|&s;pairing
of his being &s;afe, but that he might be
Lost as well as we. But &s;uppo&s;ing we never was
to &s;ee him again, I was re&s;olved to try the utmo&s;t
to &s;ave as many as I could in the Long-Boat; in
order thereunto we rai&s;ed her two Foot, and
laid a Deck upon her to keep the Sea out as much
as was po&s;&s;ible and with this Boat and 30 Men.
(for &s;he could carry no more) I intended to Row
and Sail to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> but the Men not being &s;atisfied
who &s;hould be the Men, began to be very un|ruly
in their mind and behaviour; every one
having as much rea&s;on to &s;ave him&s;elf as ano|ther,
&s;ome holding Con&s;ultation to &s;tave the
Boat, and all to run the like Fortune. But here
Brandy was our be&s;t Friend, for it kept them al|waies
Fox'd, &s;o that in all their De&s;igns I could
prevent them; &s;ome were of the mind to go by
<PB N="192" REF="124">
Land, but that I knew was impo&s;&s;ible to any
Man; neither had we Provi&s;ions, nor Ammuni|tion
to defend us from the Wild Bea&s;ts; and if it
had been pa&s;&s;able, that is any going on the ground
for Bogs, that they would have met with Rivers
that they knew not whether to go: &s;o there be|ing
no probability of going by Land, nor for
any to attempt going in the Boat, without forty
Men having been fir&s;t de&s;troyed. I will leave it
to the con&s;ideratiion of any, whither we were
not in a very mi&s;erable condition without Divine
Providence: to Write my thought I had at that
time, to &s;ave as many Men as I could, it is not
pertinent at all to the Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ince it cannot
but be imagined to be Tragical. The Weather
continued &s;till very bad with Fogs, Snow, Rain,
and Fro&s;t, till the 9. Day of our being on Shore,
which was the 8. Day of <HI>July,</HI> when in the Morn|ing
it cleared up, and to our great joy, one of
the Sailors cried out a Sail, which proved Cap|tain
<HI>Flawes,</HI> as rea&s;onable may be imagined; &s;o
we &s;et fire to our Town that he might &s;ee where
we was, which he pre&s;ently &s;aw, &s;o come to us,
and &s;ent his Boat to us (but before I went off) I
Writ a brief Relation of the intention of the
Voyage, with the Accidents that had befallen us,
and put it in a Gla&s;s-Bottle, and left it in the
Fortification I had there built. So by twelve a
Clock we all got &s;afe on Board, but left all on
Shore that we had &s;aved from the Ship; for we
much feared it &s;hould prove foggy again.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="geographical description">
<PB N="193" REF="124">
<HEAD>Now I intend to give a brief de&s;cri|ption
of the Land, and the Ob&s;er|vations
I made there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NOva Zembla,</HI> is &s;o called by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI>
which &s;ignifieth <HI>New Land</HI> in their
Language; to prove it is either an
I&s;land, or whither it joyneth to the
Continent of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> would be a very hard
Task, nor is it certainly known to any; for by
Circum&s;tances I think it impo&s;&s;ible to prove, and
by Experience the &s;earch thereof is &s;o impo&s;&s;ible
that it will hardly be tryed.</P>
<P>But let it be either, I think the matter is not
much, &s;ince it is the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Country that
lyeth on the Foundation of the Earth; a Coun|try
mo&s;t part of it covered perpetually with Snow,
and that that is bare is not to be walked on, be|ing
like Bogs, upon who&s;e Superficies grows a
kind of Mo&s;s; which beareth a &s;mall blue and
yellow Flower, and this is all the Product of the
Earth of this Country. Under the &s;uperficies of
this Earth, about two Foot deep, after we had dug
&s;o low, we came to a firm Body of Ice; which, as
I think, was never heard of before: &s;o the&s;e Men
that did imagin, if they were forced to Winter
to the Northward, would dig Caves in the Earth
to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from cold, would find
<PB N="194" REF="125">
here but very bad Lodging. The Snow lieth
here contrary to what it doth in any other Coun|try;
for in all other Climates the Snow melteth
&s;oone&s;t away near the Sea &s;ide, but here the Sea
beateth again&s;t the &s;nowy Clifts, which in &s;ome
places are as high as either of the Forelands in
<HI>Kent:</HI> the Sea has wa&s;hed underneath the Snow
a prodigious way, and the Snow over hanging,
mo&s;t fearful to behold, and up from the Water
&s;ide, upon the fir&s;t Ridge of Hills, the Snow
was melted till you come to the next Ridge,
which are Mountains, and they all the way up
are covered with Snow, which I believe hath
lain there evere &s;ince the Creation; but after we
had a&s;cended this, which in &s;ome places was al|mo&s;t
Perpendicular, we came to the top of all
the Mountains, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, for we could
not &s;ee far; for we could hardly &s;ee one the other
the Fog was &s;o thick, and remained &s;o all the
time we were in the Country; but on the top of
the&s;e Hills we found it bare from Snow, and in|different
good walking. The be&s;t that I found
in the Country were only Bears: I continued on
the top of tho&s;e Hills fome two hours, and went
as far as was convenient, that we might find the
way back again. Here I found the Track of
many large Deer, al&s;o we found an Horn of
Beam of Deer; be&s;ides Deer, there be abundance
of large White Bears, and &s;ome Foxes, and a
little Creature much like a Coney, but not &s;o
big as a Rat; and &s;ome few little Birds like
Larks, and the&s;e be all the Bea&s;ts or Fowls
we found in the Country. Every quarter of a
<PB N="195" REF="125">
Mile there runneth down from the Hills into the
Sea a &s;mall Rivulet of very good Water, which
is melted from Snow. Upon the Hills we found
abundance of Slate-&s;tone, which made it good
walking; but at the Sea &s;ide, where the Rivu|let
came down, we found very good Black
Marble, with White Veins in it.</P>
<P>The Point where we lo&s;t our Ship I called
Point <HI>Speedill:</HI> the high Hills I called King
<HI>Charles</HI>'s Snow Hills; and the next Point to the
Southward, which is the We&s;termo&s;t Point of
<HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> I named <HI>James</HI> Foreland, and the
Point to the Northward, <HI>York</HI> Point. Point <HI>Speedill</HI>
lieth in the Lat. of 74 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> North, and in
the Longitude Ea&s;t from the City of <HI>London</HI> 63 <HI>d.</HI>
00 <HI>m.</HI> The variation of the Compa&s;s is 13 <HI>d.</HI>
We&s;t, and it is full Sea at South-we&s;t Moon.
The Tide ri&s;eth 8 Foot, and &s;etteth directly
upon the Shore, which is a certain &s;ign that there
is no Pa&s;&s;age to the Northward. The Sea Wa|ter,
about the Ice and Land, is very &s;alt, and
much &s;alter than any I ever ta&s;ted, and a great
deal heavier, and I may certainly &s;ay the cleare&s;t
in the World, for I could &s;ee the ground very
plain in 80 Fathom Water, which is 480 Foot,
there being few Steeples &s;o high as that was
deep, and I could &s;ee the Shells at the bottom
very plain.</P>
<P>If the Voyage had &s;ucceeded, I &s;hould, God
willing, have given a more full and nice account
of all the Experiments I had, and &s;hould have
made, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Magnet, which I

<P>WE &s;et Sail the 15th of <HI>April,</HI> 1671.
about noon from the <HI>Elbe.</HI> The Wind
was North-ea&s;t. At night, when
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e came by the <HI>Hilge-land,</HI> it bore to North-we&s;t.
The name of the Ship was <HI>Jones in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hale, Peter Peter&s;on</HI> of <HI>Fri&s;eland</HI> Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="131">
The 27th we had &s;torms, hail and &s;now,
with very cold weather, the wind North-ea&s;t
and by ea&s;t, we were in 71 degrees, and came
to the Ice, and turned back again. The <HI>I&s;land</HI>
of<HI>John Maien</HI> bore from us South-we&s;t and
by we&s;t, as near as we could gue&s;s within ten
Miles. We might have &s;een the I&s;land plain
enough, but the Air was haizy and full of
fogs and &s;now, &s;o that we could not &s;ee far.
About noon it blew a &s;torm, whereupon we
took down our Top-&s;ails, and furling our Main|&s;ail,
drove with the Mi&s;&s;en-&s;ail towards South-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The 29th it was foggy all day, the wind
North ea&s;t and by north, we came to the Ice,
and &s;ailed from it again, as you may &s;ee in the
Plate<HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>The 3cth, the fir&s;t Sunday after <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> was
foggy, with rain and &s;now, the wind at North,
at night we came to the Ice, but &s;ailed from it
again; the Sea was tempe&s;tuous, and to&s;&s;ed
our Ship very much.</P>
<P>The 3d of <HI>May</HI> was cold, &s;nowy, with hail,
and mi&s;ty Sun-&s;hine, the wind North-we&s;t and
by we&s;t, the Sun &s;et no more, we &s;aw it as
well by night as by day.</P>
<P>The fourth we had &s;now, hail, and gloomy
Sun-&s;hine, with cold weather, but not exce&s;|&s;ive,
the wind at North-we&s;t, the weather e|very
day uncon&s;tant. Here we &s;aw abundance
of <HI>Seales,</HI> they jump'd out of the water before
the Ship, and which was &s;trange, they would
&s;tand half out of the water, and as it were
dance together.</P>
<P>The 5th-in the forenoon it was moderately
cold, and Sun-&s;hine, but toward noon darki&s;h
and cloudy, with &s;now and great fro&s;t, the
<PB N="3" REF="131">
wind North-we&s;t and by North. We &s;aw dai|ly
many Ships, failing about the Ice, I ob&s;er|ved
that as they pa&s;&s;ed by one another, they
haled one another, crying <HI>Holla,</HI> and asked
each other how many fi&s;h they had caught,
but they would not &s;tick &s;ometimes to tell more
then they had. When it was windy, that they
could not hear one another, they waved their
Hats, to &s;ignifie the number caught. But when
they have their full Fraight of <HI>Whales,</HI> they put
up their great Flag as a &s;ign thereof; then if
any hath a Me&s;&s;age to be &s;ent, he delivers it to
them, as you may &s;ee in the Plate <HI>A</HI> by <HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>The 7th we had moderate fro&s;t, clouds and
&s;now with rain. In the evening we &s;ailed to
the Ice, the wind was quite contrary to us, and
the Ice too &s;mall, wherefore we &s;ailed from it.
In the afternoon we &s;aw <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> the South
point of the North-foreland, we &s;uppo&s;ed it
the true Harbour. The Land appeared like a
dark Cloud, full of white &s;treeks, we turned
to the We&s;t again, that is, according to the
Compa&s;s, which is al&s; to be under&s;tood of the
Ice and Harbour.</P>
<P>The 9th was the &s;ame weather, and cold as
before, the Wind South-we&s;t and by we&s;t.
In the afternoon a <HI>Fin-fi&s;h</HI> &s;wam by our Ship,
which we took at fir&s;t to be a <HI>Whale,</HI> before we
&s;aw the high fins of his tail, and came near to
it. We had let down our Sloop from the Ship,
but that labour was lo&s;t, for he was not worth
taking.</P>
<P>From the 25th of <HI>April</HI> to this day, we had
not taken the Sun's altitude, we were then in
70 degrees and 3 minutes, and &s;ailed towards
the North and the Ice. It may &s;eem &s;trange,
that we &s;o often &s;ailed to the Ice and from it
<PB N="4" REF="132">
again, but I &s;hall give you a rea&s;on for that
hereafter.</P>
<P>The12th it was &s;tormy and exce&s;&s;ive cold,
the wind North&punc; and we had the greate&s;t fro&s;ts
in this Month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>On the 14th the wind was North-we&s;t, fine
weather, with Sun-&s;hine, we were within 75
degrees and 22 minutes. We told twenty Ships
about us, the Sea was very even, and we hard|ly
felt any wind, yet it was very cold.</P>
<P>In this place the Sea becomes &s;mooth pre|&s;ently
again after a &s;torm, chiefly when the
wind blows from the Ice; but when it blows
off the Sea, it always makes a great Sea.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day we &s;aw a <HI>Whale</HI> not far off from
our Ship, we put out four Boats from on board
after him, but this labour was al&s;o in vain, for
he run under water, and &s;aw him no more.</P>
<P>On the 19th we had a dull Sun-&s;hine, the
wind was North, and it was &s;o calm that we
could hardly feel it; we rowed in the Ship|boat
to the Ice, and killed two <HI>Sea-hounds</HI> or
<HI>Seales;</HI> there were &s;o many of them on the Ice
that they could not be numbred.</P>
<P>On the 20th it was exceeding cold, &s;o that
the very Sea was all frozen over; yet it was
&s;o calm and &s;till, that we could hardly perceive
the wind, which was North; there were nine
Ships in our Company which &s;ailed about the
Ice; we found &s;till the longer we &s;ailed the
bigger the Ice.</P>
<P>On the 21th (which was the fourth Sunday
after <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>) we &s;ailed into the Ice in the fore|noon,
with another <HI>Hamburger</HI>-&s;hip, called the
<HI>Le peler,</HI> with 8 <HI>Hollanders.</HI> We fixed our Ship
with Ice-hooks to a large Ice-field, when the
Sun was South-we&s;t and by &s;outh; we num-bred
<PB REF="132">

30 Ships in the Sea; they lay as it
were in an Harbour or Haven (as you may &s;ee
Plate <HI>A</HI> at <HI>B.</HI>) Thus they venture their Ships in
the Ice with great hazzard.</P>
<P>On the 30th it was fair weather in the morn|ing,
&s;nowy about noon, the wind was South|we&s;t
and very calm. We rowed in the great
Sloop, before the Ship, farther into the Ice. In
the morning we heard a <HI>Whale</HI> blow, when the
Sun was in the Ea&s;t, and brought the <HI>Whale</HI> to
the Ship, when the Sun was at South-we&s;t and
by ea&s;t; the &s;ame day we cut the Fat from it,
and filled with it 70 Barrels (which they call
Kardels.) By this fi&s;h we found abundance of
Birds, mo&s;t of them were <HI>Mallemucks,</HI> (that is
to &s;ay fooli&s;h Gnats) which were &s;o greedy of
their food, that we kill'd them with &s;ticks.
This fi&s;h was found out by the Birds, for we
&s;aw every where by them in the Sea where the
Whale had been, for he was wounded by an
Harping Iron that &s;tuck &s;till in his fle&s;h, and he
had al&s;o &s;pent him&s;elf with hard &s;wimming;
he blowed al&s;o very hollow, he &s;tank alive, and
the birds fed upon him. This <HI>Whale</HI> fermented
when it was dead, and the &s;team that came
from it inflamed our eyes, and made them sore.
See Tab. <HI>A</HI> at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ame night <HI>Cornelius Seaman</HI> lo&s;t his Ship
by the &s;queezing and cru&s;hing together of the
Ice, for in this place are very great Sheets or
I&s;lands of Ice, and the Seamen call it <HI>We&s;t-Ice,</HI> be|cau&s;e
it lieth towards the We&s;t, as you may &s;ee
in the Plate <HI>B</HI> marked with <HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>On the 2d of <HI>June</HI> we had a &s;evere fro&s;t in
the forenoon, and in the night we &s;aw the
Moon very pale, as it u&s;ed to look in the day
time in our Country, with clear Sun-&s;hine,
<PB N="6" REF="135">
whereupon followed mi&s;t and &s;now, the wind
North-ea&s;t and by north.</P>
<P>In the morning, <HI>June</HI> the 4th, we were a
hunting again after a <HI>Whale,</HI> and we came &s;o
near unto one, that the Harponier was ju&s;t a
going to fling his Harpoon into her, but &s;he
&s;unk down behind, and held her head out of
the water, and &s;o &s;unk down like a &s;tone (as
is to be &s;een by <HI>d</HI> on the cut <HI>A</HI>) and we &s;aw
her no more; it was very like that the great
Ice-field was full of holes in the middle, &s;o
that the <HI>Whale</HI> could fetch breath underneath
the Ice. A great many more Ships lay about
this &s;heet of Ice, one hunted the <HI>Whales</HI> to the
other, and &s;o they were frighted, and became
very &s;hy. So one gets as many fi&s;hes as the o|ther,
and &s;ometimes they all get one. We were
there &s;everal times a hunting that very day, and
yet we got never a one.</P>
<P>On the 8th it was foggy, and &s;nowed all day;
we &s;aw that day very many (<HI>Sea-dogs</HI> or) <HI>Seales</HI>
on the Ice about the Sea-&s;ide, &s;o we &s;et out a
Boat and killed 15 of them.</P>
<P>On the 12th it was cold and &s;tormy all day,
at night Sun-&s;hine; he that takes not exact no|tice,
knows no difference whether it by day or
night.</P>
<P>On the 13th in the afternoon it was windy
and foggy, we were in 77 degrees; we &s;ailed
along by the Ice &s;omewhat ea&s;terly towards
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> as is to be &s;een in the Cut <HI>A</HI> at <HI>e.</HI>
That night we &s;aw more then 20 <HI>Whales</HI> that
run one after another towards the Ice; out of
them we got our &s;econd fi&s;h, which was a
male one; and this fi&s;h, when they wounded
him with Lances, bled very much, &s;o that the
Sea was tinged by it where he &s;wam: we brought
<PB N="7" REF="135">
him to the Ship when the Sun was in
the North: for the Sun is the Clock to the
Seamen in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for el&s;e they would live
without order, and mi&s;take in the u&s;ual &s;even
weekly days.</P>
<P>On the 14th it was cold and windy, the night
foggy, the wind blew We&s;t, that day we came
to <HI>Hans Lichtenberg.</HI></P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen, June</HI> the 14th.
Fir&s;t we came to the <HI>Foreland</HI> thereof, then to
the &s;even <HI>Ice-hills</HI> or Mountains, then we pa&s;&s;ed
the Harbour or Bay of the <HI>Hamburgers, Mag|dalens,
Engli&s;h</HI> men and <HI>Danes,</HI> and &s;ailed into
the South-bay: we were followed by 7 Ships,
3 <HI>Hamburgers</HI> and 4 <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as is to be &s;een
by <HI>a</HI> in the Plate <HI>C.</HI> For here it is ju&s;t the
&s;ame, as when they will &s;ail into the Ice, if
more then one is there, for no body cares to
be the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they do not know in what
condition the Harbour or the Ice is within.
In our Voyage thither we &s;aw no Ice at all, un|til
we came to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for the wind had
blown it all away; in the night we did cut off
the fat of the fi&s;h, and filled with it 65 Kardels
or Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>That night we &s;ailed with three Boats into
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Harbour or Bay, and &s;aw a <HI>Whale,</HI>
and flung into him three Harpoons, and threw
our Lances into him; the <HI>Whale</HI> run under|neath
the &s;mall Ice, and remained a great while
under water before he came up again, and then
ran but a very little way before he came up a|gain;
and this he repeated very often, &s;o that
we were forced to wait on him above half an
hour, before he came from underneath the Ice.
The Harpoons broke out at length, and we lo&s;t
him. On the Ice we &s;aw two great <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="136">
or <HI>Mor&s;es,</HI> that were got upon the &s;heet of Ice,
through a hole that was in it, and were a&s;leep;
we cut off their return by covering the hole
with a piece of Ice; then we awaken'd them
with our Lances, and they began to defend
them&s;elves for a while before they were killed.
We &s;aw al&s;o many White-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 22th we had very fair weather, and
pretty warm; we were by <HI>Rehenfelt (Deersfeild)</HI>
where the Ice &s;tood firm: we &s;aw &s;ix <HI>Whales,</HI>
and got one of them that was a male, and our
third fi&s;h; he was kill'd at night when the Sun
&s;tood we&s;tward: this fi&s;h was kill'd by one
man, who flung the Harpoon into him; and
kill'd him al&s;o, while the other Boats were bu|&s;ie
in pur&s;uing or hunting after another <HI>Whale.</HI>
This fi&s;h run to the Ice, and before he died,
beat about him with his tail; the Ice &s;etled a|bout
him &s;o that the other Boats could not
come to this Boat to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, till the Ice &s;e|parated
again, that they might row, when they
tied one Boat behind the other, and &s;o towed
the <HI>Whale</HI> to the great Ship, where they cut him
up into the Ve&s;&s;els, and filled with him 45 Bar|rels.
This night the Sun &s;hined very bright|ly.</P>
<P>On the 29th we had fair weather, Sun-&s;hine
and calm. On the &s;ame day we &s;ailed before
the wide Harbour or Bay; where we found a
great quantity of the fat of a <HI>Whale,</HI> three Ve&s;|&s;els
full, together with the Image of St. <HI>Nicho|las,</HI>
which &s;tood behind a Ship that was lo&s;t,
driving in the Sea. There was al&s;o here and
there &s;till much Ice.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of <HI>July</HI> about noon, two <HI>Whale</HI>
came near to our Ship; we &s;aw that they had
a mind to couple together; we &s;et our Boat
<PB N="9" REF="136">
for them, and the Harpoonier hit the female,
which when the other found, he did not &s;tay
at all, but made away. The female run all
along above the water &s;traight forward, beating
about with her tail and fins, &s;o that we dur&s;t
not come near to lance her; yet one of our
Harpooniers was &s;o fool hardy to venture too
near to the fi&s;h, which &s;aluted him with a &s;troak
of her tail over his back &s;o vehemently, that
he had much ado to recover his breath again.
Tho&s;e in the other Boat, to &s;hew their valour
al&s;o, ha&s;ten'd to the fi&s;h, which overturned their
Boat, &s;o that the Harpoonier was forced to
dive for it, and hide his head underneath the
water; the re&s;t did the &s;ame; they thought it
very long before they came out, for it was cold,
&s;o that they came quaking to the Ship again.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame morning a <HI>Whale</HI> appear'd near
our Ship before the wide Harbour, we put out
four Boats from our Ship after him, but two
<HI>Holland</HI> Ships were about half a League from
us, one of them &s;ent out a Boat towards us;
we u&s;ed great diligence and care to take him,
but the fi&s;h came up ju&s;t before the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s
Boat, and was &s;truck by him with a Harpoon.
Thus he took the bread out of our mouths.</P>
<P>On the 2d of <HI>July</HI> we had Sun-&s;hine all day
and night long, and it was pretty warm with|al;
about midnight we went a hunting, and
caught the fifth fi&s;h, who was a male; we cut
the fat off, and flung it into the Foreca&s;tle.
This is done when they are very bu&s;ie in <HI>Whale</HI>
catching, that they may not lo&s;e time, then
they cut great pieces off of the <HI>Whale,</HI> that
they may have done the &s;ooner, for it doth
not harm the fat if it &s;hould lie &s;o for &s;everal
days; nay, &s;ome reckon it to be the better
<PB N="10" REF="137">
for it, but that cannot be, for the fat runs away
from it.</P>
<P>On the 4th we had Sun-&s;hine all day and
night. We &s;till were <HI>Whale-</HI> hunting, and that
night we got the &s;ixth fi&s;h, a male al&s;o, he held
49 <HI>Kardels</HI> of fat.</P>
<P>On the 3d and 4th day of <HI>July</HI> we &s;aw more
<HI>Whales</HI> than we did in all our Voyage.</P>
<P>On the 5th of <HI>July</HI> in the forenoon it was
bright Sun-&s;hine, and pretty warm, in the af|ternoon
it was foggy, at night Sun-&s;hine again,
which la&s;ted all the night. We hunted all that
day long, and in the morning we &s;truck a
<HI>Whale</HI> before the <HI>Weigatt;</HI> this fi&s;h run round
about under the water, and &s;o fa&s;tned the Line
whereon our Harpoon was about a Rock, &s;o
that the Harpoon lo&s;t its hold, and that fi&s;h got
away. This <HI>Whale</HI> did blow the water &s;o fierce|ly,
that one might hear it at a Leagues di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day about noon, the wind &s;outh,
and Sun-&s;hine, we got the &s;eventh fi&s;h, which
was a female, and had 45 <HI>Kardels</HI> of fat; this
we cut al&s;o into the Hold, and &s;o we &s;ailed
from <HI>Weigatt,</HI> a little toward the we&s;t before
the <HI>Mu&s;cle-Harbour,</HI> where we dropped our An|chor;
we were employed with cutting the
great pieces of fat into le&s;&s;er pieces, to fill our
<HI>Kardels</HI> with them: in the mean while the
wind turned to North-we&s;t and we&s;t, and the
&s;ingle Anchor was dragg'd by the Ship, &s;o we
dropped another, and would have weigh'd up
the former, but our Cable broke, the Anchor
being fa&s;tned to a Rock.</P>
<P>On the 6th we had the &s;ame weather, and
warm Sun-&s;hine all night. Hard by us rode a
<HI>Hollander,</HI> and the Ships crew bu&s;ie in cutting
<PB N="11" REF="137">
the fat of a <HI>Whale,</HI> when the fi&s;h bur&s;t with &s;o
great a bounce, as if a Canon had been di&s;|charged,
and be&s;pattered the Workmen all o|ver.</P>
<P>On the 8th the wind turned North-we&s;t,
with &s;now and rain. We were forced to leave
one of our Anchors, and thank'd God for get|ting
off from Land, for the Ice came on fierce|ly
upon us; at night the wind was laid, and it
was colder, although the Sun &s;hined.</P>
<P>On the 9th we got another male <HI>Whale,</HI> be|ing
the eighth, which was yellow underneath
the head; we filled with him 54 <HI>Kardels</HI> with
fat; the Sun &s;hined all night.</P>
<P>On the 12th we had gloomy Sun-&s;hine all
day. At night we &s;ailed with three Boats into
the Ice before the <HI>Weigatt,</HI> and got three white
Bears, an old one with two young ones, they
&s;wam in the water like fi&s;h. On the Ice lay
abundance of <HI>Sea-hor&s;es,</HI> and the further we
came into the Ice there were the more of them,
we rowed up to them, and when we came
near to them we killed ten of them, the re&s;t
came all about our Boat, and beat holes through
the &s;ides of the Boat, &s;o that we took in a|bundance
of water, we were forced at length
to row away from them becau&s;e of their great
number, for they gathered them&s;elves more
and more together; they pur&s;ued us as long as
we could &s;ee them, very furiou&s;ly. Afterwards
we met with another very great one who lay
in the water fa&s;t a&s;leep, but when he felt our
Harpoon within him he was very much fright|ned,
and ran away before the Boat again, where
he was &s;oon ea&s;ed of his fright by our Lances.
We &s;aw but very few <HI>Whales</HI> more, and tho&s;e
we did &s;ee were quite wild, that we could not
<PB N="12" REF="138">
come near them. That night it was &s;o dark
and foggy, that we could hardly &s;ee the Ships
length; we might have got <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI> enough,
but we were afraid of loo&s;ing our Ships, for
we had examples enough of them that had lo&s;t
their Ships, and could not come to them a|gain,
but have been forced to return home
in other Ships. When after this manner any
have lo&s;t their Ships, and cannot be &s;een&punc; they
di&s;charge a Cannon from the Ship, or &s;ound
the Trumpets, or Haut-boys, according as they
are provided in their Ships, that the men that
are lo&s;t may find their Ship again.</P>
<P>On the 13th we had cloudy Sun-&s;hine, the
wind towards night turned to North-ea&s;t and
by ea&s;t. The Ice came a floating down apace,
we &s;ailed from the South-ea&s;t Land to the we&s;t,
and we could but ju&s;t get through by the North
&s;ide from the <HI>Bear-Harbour</HI> or Bay. We &s;ailed
on to the <HI>Rehenfelt</HI> (or <HI>Deer-field)</HI> where the Ice
was already fixed to the Land, &s;o that we
could but ju&s;t get through; we &s;ailed further
to the <HI>Vogel&s;anck (Birds-&s;ong)</HI> as you may &s;ee by
<HI>b</HI> in the Plate <HI>D.</HI> Then we turned toward
the Ea&s;t with a North-ea&s;t wind, in company
with twelve Ships more, to &s;ee whether there
were any more <HI>Whales</HI> left, with <HI>George</HI> and
<HI>Cornelius Mangel&s;en,</HI> and <HI>Michael Appel,</HI> who &s;ail|ed
in four fathoms water, and touched upon
the wreck of a Ship that was lo&s;t there.</P>
<P>On the 14th in the morning we &s;ailed &s;till
among&s;t the Ice, the wind being North-ea&s;t
and by ea&s;t; we had a fogg all that day, with
Sun-&s;hine, with a Rainbow of two colours,
white and pale yellow, and it was very cold,
and we &s;aw the Sun a great deal lower.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="138">
On the 15th it was windy, cold, and foggy
the whole day; the wind turned North-we&s;t,
and the Ice came on in abundance, &s;o that
we could hardly &s;ail, for it was every where
full of &s;mall &s;heets of Ice. At this time there
were many &s;hips be&s;et with Ice, in the <HI>Deer</HI> or
<HI>Mu&s;cle-Bay.</HI> We &s;ailed all along near the &s;hoar,

(marked with <HI>c</HI> in the Cut <HI>D</HI>) where 28 Ships
lay at Anchor, 8 whereof were <HI>Hamburgers,</HI>
the re&s;t <HI>Dutchmen.</HI> From that time, when we
&s;ailed out of the <HI>South-haven,</HI> we kept always
within &s;ight of the Land, and &s;aw it always,
except it was foggy; and &s;o long the Skippers
&s;tay by the Ice, to &s;ee whether there is any
more <HI>Whales</HI> to be had. That night we fetched
water from the Land, near the <HI>Cookery</HI> of <HI>Har|lingen,</HI>
out of a hole, marked by <HI>b</HI> in the

<P>On the 16th in the morning we &s;aw the

<P>On the 18th we had fair weather, with Sun|&s;hine,
and we were al&s;o becalmed that we could
not &s;ail, wherefore we towed with a Boat into
the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Harbour, to gather &s;ome Herbs from
the Rocks. In the <HI>South-Haven</HI> rode 30 Ships
at Anchor.</P>
<P>On the 19th we had warm Sun-&s;hine and fair
weather, but in the night &s;tormy and rain.</P>

(for <HI>Spitz</HI> is pointed) are &s;ituated under

<FIGURE>

<PB REF="143">
<PB N="17" REF="143">
year; but how far this Country is extended to
the North, is &s;till unknown.</P>
<P>It &s;eemeth, becau&s;e the Ice &s;tands firm, and
floats not, as that in the Sea doth, that there
&s;hould be land not far behind it.</P>
<P>As the highe&s;t Countries are &s;urrounded with
Mountains, as a Fortification is with Walls and
Works, &s;o are the&s;e Countries naturally &s;ur|rounded
with high Hills.</P>
<P>The inward Condition of this Country
we do not know, but it &s;eemeth, &s;ince we &s;ee
one Hill behind another, that it is &s;o throughout
the whole Country.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Mu&s;cle-Haven,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;cle-Bay,</HI> we find
plainer and leveller Ground; and the farther
we &s;ail toward the Ea&s;t, the Ground groweth
the lower, yet it is all &s;tony, and with pro|&s;pects
of &s;maller Hills; it doth not look at all
as if it could be inhabited by Men.</P>
<P>I believe al&s;o that the Land there mu&s;t of
nece&s;&s;ity be lower and lower; for el&s;e we &s;hould
&s;ee it higher above the other, as we do the other
Mountains.</P>
<P>Concerning the Bea&s;ts that live on this Land,
I believe they come over the Ice in the Spring,
when the Ice &s;tands firm, into the&s;e Countries,
and that the &s;ame way they go away from
thence again, when the long nights begin.</P>
<P>Concerning the Birds, we have partly a
good account of them, their places and food
is known, as I &s;hall mention when I come to
write of them.</P>
<P>When on the 18th of <HI>June,</HI> on a <HI>Sunday</HI> in
the forenoon, we fir&s;t came to the Foreland of
<HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> the foot of the&s;e Mountains look|ed
like fire, and the tops of them were cover|with
foggs; the &s;now was marbel'd, and look'd
<PB N="18" REF="144">
as if it were boughs of branches of Trees, and
gave as bright and glorious a &s;hining of glo&s;s to
the Air or Skies, as if the Sun had &s;hin'd.</P>
<P>When the Mountains look thus fiery, a hard
&s;torm generally en&s;ues.</P>
<P>The&s;e Countries are in the Winter encom|pa&s;&s;ed
with Ice from divers places, according
as the winds blow; as if it be Ea&s;t from <HI>Nova
Zembla,</HI> if North-we&s;t form <HI>Greenland,</HI> and the
I&s;land of <HI>John Mayen:</HI> it al&s;o happeneth &s;ome|times
that the Land is begirt with Ice in the
Summer, as they have often &s;een, that go thither
every year.</P>
<P>But when the Ice comes floating on too
hard, or in too great a quantity, then the Ships
make to the Harbours, Havens, Bays or Ri|vers,
as they call them, that run up into the
Country; the wind u&s;eth to receive us &s;ome|thing
unkindly, when we &s;ail into them, roar|ing
over the dry Hills with &s;mall Whirl-winds.
The water in the&s;e Rivers is &s;alt.</P>
<P>We meet here with no fre&s;h Streams or Ri|volets;
nor did I ever &s;ee a Spring there.</P>
<P>Of &s;ome Rivers we know their beginning,
of others it cannot found out, becau&s;e of
the danger of the Ice, which they are never
free from; &s;ome becau&s;e of the hidden Rocks
underneath the water, which are di&s;covered
by the vehement breaking of the Sea, or by
great quantity of white foam.</P>
<P>The Names of the Havens you find all in
order one after another in the Map of <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
as far as we have been.</P>
<P>The&s;e Havens they reckon to be the &s;afe&s;t,
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Safe-Harbour,</HI> and the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North-Bay,</HI>
which are the mo&s;t known of any in
<HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="144">
The other Havens, of what names &s;oever,
we commonly &s;ail by, becau&s;e they lye open
to the Sea.</P>
<P>Others we pa&s;s by becau&s;e of the con&s;tant
Ice that is in them, and the hidden Rocks.</P>
<P>In the <HI>South</HI> or <HI>North-Haven</HI> or <HI>Bay,</HI> ride com|monly
the mo&s;t Ships; I told &s;everal times ten,
twenty, nay thirty Ships, that lay at Anchor,
as your may &s;ee in the Plates <HI>C</HI> and <HI>D,</HI> marked
with <HI>c</HI> and <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Birds, we &s;ee abundance
more of them by and on the Land, then a|mong
the Ice, chiefly when they hatch their
Eggs; we do not find they make their Ne&s;t up
with far-fetcht things, neither do they gather
any thing for them from <HI>Norway, Schetland,</HI> or
the like.</P>
<P>The Seeds of &s;everal Herbs might grow in
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but the Herbs nature hath be&s;tow|ed
on tho&s;e Countries are &s;uch as are fit for
the Di&s;ea&s;es and Di&s;tempers that are common
there.</P>
<P>We &s;aw abundance of <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI> by <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
on the low Land, and upon the Ice;
but we &s;aw but very few <HI>Seales</HI> on the Ice there|about.</P>
<P>The Country (as is afore&s;aid) is &s;tony, and
quite throughout it are high Mountains and
Rocks.</P>
<P>Below, at the feet of the Mountains, &s;tand
the Hills of Ice very high, and reach to the
tops of the Mountains; the Cliffs are filled up
with Snow; wherefore the&s;e Snow-Mountains
&s;how very &s;trange to tho&s;e that never &s;aw them
before, they appear like dry Trees with Bran|ches
and Twigs, and when the Snow falleth
upon them they get Leaves as it were, which
<PB N="20" REF="145">
&s;oon after melt, and others come in the room
of them.</P>
<P>There are &s;even large Ice-Mountains in a
Line in the&s;e Countries, that lye between the
high Rocks, which look of a glorious blew co|lour,
as al&s;o is the Ice, with a great many
cracks and Holes in them; they are hollowed
out, melted away, and cut in Groves by the
rain and &s;now-water that runs down; they are
increa&s;ed greatly by the Snow, as the other Ice
that &s;wimmeth in the Sea is al&s;o: they are aug|mented
likewi&s;e by the melted Snow from the
Rocks, and from the Rain that falls on them.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;even Mountains of Ice are e&s;teemed
to be the highe&s;t in the Country; indeed they
&s;hewed very high as we &s;ailed by them, under|neath:
the Snow look'd dark from the &s;hades
of the Skies, which &s;hewed very neat and cu|rious,
with the blew cracks where the Ice was
broken off.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Mountains &s;ome
foggy Clouds hovered over; above the&s;e the
Snow was very bright.</P>
<P>The true Rocks look't fiery, and the Sun
&s;hin'd pale upon them, the Snow giving the
Air a bright reflection. They were covered
with Clouds, &s;o that you could &s;carce &s;ee the
tops of them.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Rocks are but one &s;tone from
the bottom to the top, appearing like an old
decayed Wall; they &s;mell very &s;weet, as the
green Fields do in our Country in the Spring
when it rains. See <HI>c c</HI> in the Plate <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tones for the mo&s;t part are vein'd dif|ferently,
like Marble, with red, white, and
yellow: at the alteration of the weather the
&s;tones &s;weat, and by that means the Snow is
<PB N="21" REF="145">
&s;tained or coloured; and al&s;o if it raineth much,
the water runs down by the Rocks, and from
thence the Snow is tinged red.</P>
<P>On the foot of the Mountains, where no
mounts of Ice &s;tand, lye great loo&s;e Rocks, as
they chance to be fall'n one upon the other,
with Caves and Holes, &s;o that it is very tickli&s;h
walking upon them; both great and &s;mall
Stones or Rocks are mixt together: the&s;e &s;tones
are of a grey colour, or grey with black veins,
they gli&s;ter like Silver-oar. Most of the Rocks
that are at the bottom of the Mounts are like
the Pebles we pave our Streets withal. On the&s;e
Rocks grow all &s;orts of Herbs, Graves, and
Mo&s;s very plentifully; they grow up in the
two Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> from the &s;eed to
bear &s;eed again. Look <HI>f</HI> in the Plate <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>The Herbs grow thicke&s;t where that water
runs of falls down from the Hills, (and al&s;o
where they are defended from the North and
Ea&s;t winds) from whence always &s;ome Du&s;t
or Mo&s;s is carried down with it, which after
a long time becomes Earth (yet it is rather
dung than a true earth) and the Birds do con|tribute
by their dung towards it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mountains &s;eem as if they were Earth
at top by rea&s;on of the height, but when you
are at the top of them, they are Rock as well
at the top as the bottom, which we al&s;o &s;ee,
when great pieces of them fall down. If &s;tones
are flung down from the&s;e Mountains, it &s;ounds
as if it thundred with an Echo and Rattling
in the Valleys, as if very great pieces were
thrown off from the top of them.</P>
<P>The Mountains al&s;o are full of cracks wherein
the Birds make their Ne&s;ts; they all fly down
from the Mountains to &s;eek their food in the
<PB N="22" REF="146">
water; &s;ome eat the Carrion of Fi&s;hes, others
eat &s;mall Fi&s;hes and Shrimps, as I &s;hall &s;ay, when
I treat of the Birds.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o White-Bears, Deer and Foxes
in the&s;e Countries. The Bear liveth upon dead
Whales or dead Men; the Fox feeds upon Birds
and their Eggs; and the Deer eat the Herbs.</P>
<P>One may conjecture at the height of the&s;e
Mountains by this, when ths Skies are not very
clear, the Mountains &s;tand, to about the middle,
in the Clouds; &s;ome of them look as if they
were a coming down every moment, as in the
Plate <HI>D</HI> at <HI>f.</HI></P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the lowermo&s;t Hills do not
&s;eem &s;o high, is becau&s;e &s;o very great ones &s;tand
near them. A Ship with its Ma&s;ts and Rig|ging,
in no more to be compared with the&s;e
Mountains, than a &s;mall Hou&s;e with a high
Steeple. The Miles &s;eem al&s;o to be very &s;hort,
but when you go to walk them upon the Land,
you find it quite another thing, and you will
&s;oon be tired; and al&s;o because of the rough|ne&s;s
and &s;harpne&s;s of the Rocks, and for want
of a path, you will &s;oon get warm be it ne|ver
&s;o cold: a new pair of Shoes will not la&s;t
one long here.</P>
<P>We went in the night, when it was a very
clear Sun-&s;hine, upon one of the Rocks near
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Haven, about a Mile long, to look
after a <HI>Whale</HI> that had got away from us; in
the middle of this Harbour others were a row|ing
in their Long-Boats, which we could hard|ly
di&s;cern: a great part fell down from one of
the&s;e Mountains, which &s;ounded very loud.
The Mountains look'd black, &s;trip'd with veins
of Snow. I was &s;o calm that we could hardly
perceive any breeze of wind, and not very
<PB REF="146">

cold. The &s;hoar was very full of <HI>Sea-hor&s;es,</HI> which
roared &s;o that we could hear them a great way
off, as if &s;ome Bulls had bellowed.</P>
<P>In the Country we travel thus; We take
along with us two or more Guns and Lances,
to re&s;i&s;t the Highway-men the Bears, but one
is &s;oon tired, as I &s;aid before, becau&s;e of the
&s;tones and the loo&s;e Ice, whereon it is very
trouble&s;ome to walk.</P>
<P>As many as I have &s;een of the&s;e Mountains
are &s;ituated thus; The highe&s;t are from the
<HI>Foreland</HI> to the <HI>Mu&s;cle-Haven</HI> (or <HI>Mu&s;cle Bay:</HI>)
after the <HI>Foreland</HI> follow the &s;even Ice Mounts,
which are very high Mountains; and they are
called &s;o from the Ice-Hills that fill up the Val|leys,
of lye between the Rocks. The&s;e moun|tainous
Rocks are not &s;o &s;harp or pointed at the
top as the two foremo&s;t Rocks at the <HI>Haven</HI> of
<HI>Magdalen</HI> are. Then cometh the <HI>Haven</HI> of
the <HI>Hamburgers, Magdalen,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Harbour, and at la&s;t the <HI>South-Haven.</HI>
At the <HI>Magdalen-Haven</HI> the Rocks lye in a
round of &s;emi-circle, at each &s;ide by one ano|ther,
&s;tand two high Mountains that are hol|low
within, as if they were dug out: after the
fa&s;hion of a Brea&s;t-work, with points and
cracks at the top, like Battlements; at the bot|tom
within the Hill, &s;tands a Snow-hill that

It is ob&s;ervable that a dead Carka&s;e doth not

four Hou&s;es remained, whereof two were
Ware-hou&s;es, in the others they dwelt. They
are built after this fa&s;hion, not very large; there
is a Stove before with a Ceiling at top, and
behind a Chamber taking in the whole breadth
of the Hou&s;e: the Ware-hou&s;es are &s;omething
larger; therein were &s;till &s;everal Barrels or
Kardels that were quite decayed, the Ice &s;tand|ing
in the &s;ame &s;hape the Ve&s;&s;els had been of.
An Anvile, Smith's Tongs, and other Tools
belonging to the <HI>Cookery,</HI> were frozen up in the

&s;et, and the wooden Troughs &s;tood by it.
From thence you may go to the <HI>Engli&s;h Haven;</HI>
on the other &s;ide is the place where the dead

but it is levelled on purpo&s;e. Behind the&s;e
Hou&s;es are high Mountains; if one climbeth
upon the&s;e, as we do on others, and doth not
mark every &s;tep with Chalk, one doth not
know how to get down again. When you go
up, you think it to be very ea&s;ie to be done;
but when you are to de&s;cend, it is very difficult

lo&s;t their lives.</P>
<P>The River there is called the <HI>South Harbour,</HI>

<P>At the entry into the <HI>South Harbour,</HI> in the
Valley between the Mountains, is collected
great quantities of fre&s;h Water from the Snow

Springs out of the Ground I never &s;aw in <HI>Spitz|bergen.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hoar there is not very high, but the
water is deep, there was no Ice at all to be &s;een
in it, from whence I conclude that it had not
been a &s;evere Winter; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that
the Ice could have been melted in &s;o &s;hort a

<P>The Ice doth melt much &s;ooner in Salt-water
than in fre&s;h River-water, but yet it is
impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o thick Ice could have melted
in &s;o &s;hort a time. We &s;aw al&s;o that the Snow
melted on the tops of the high Rocks, and the
water ran down, although it was there much
colder then below; yet above and below it
melted alike: differently from what I ob&s;erved
&s;ince in <HI>Spain</HI> in the Month of <HI>December</HI> 1672.
the wind being North-we&s;t, when the Rain
fell below about a quarter of a League, yet

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the SEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Waves begin to rai&s;e them&s;elves at
fir&s;t from a &s;mall breeze of wind, and by
the increa&s;e and continuance of the breeze they
grow longer, higher and bigger.</P>
<P>The Sea is not immediately made rough in
the beginning of high winds, but the Waves
&s;well by degrees and &s;lowly, until they come
to be as bigg as Mountains; then they expand
and break them&s;elves, and fall over with da&s;h|ing
and foaming, as you may &s;ee by <HI>k</HI> in the
Cut <HI>D</HI></P>
<P>Then the following Wave from behind rai&s;|ith
it again, with much curled and foaming
Scum, neatly &s;potted with the white Foam,
looking like Marble. This breaking and foam|ing
of the Waves is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively repeated.</P>
<P>So the &s;welling Waves continually follow one
another, moving before the wind with a quick
motion, but when the&s;e Waves are &s;hort, they
da&s;h over the Ship, and break much, &s;o that the
Ship is hardly able to live.</P>
<P>In &s;tormy weather little Waves curle on the
top of the great ones, and le&s;&s;er again upon
them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="152">
The Ships do not feel the&s;e &s;maller Waves but
only the great ones, that are called Sea-Moun|tains,
which heave and mount the Ship with
them, but neverthele&s;s &s;he always keeps her
&s;trait way through the&s;e unpathed Waves, which
is wonderful to behold.</P>
<P>In a hard &s;torm the froth of the Sea drives
like du&s;t, and looketh as when the wind driveth
the Snow along upon the Ice, or as the Du&s;t of
the Earth does in dry weather, and you &s;ee the
Sea every where to look like curled Ice, that
when it is a freezing is hindred from it by the
wind, all covered with a white foam, and one
Wave blows over the precedent, with a great
roaring and noi&s;e, as if a Water-mill were a
going; and this &s;ame noi&s;e the Ships make
likewi&s;e when they cut through the Sea.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the Waves da&s;h
again&s;t one another when the wind changeth,
and cro&s;s over through one another, with
great da&s;hing over the Ships, before they move
all one and the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>I did not ob&s;erve here the Seawater &s;o clear,
nor found it &s;o &s;alt as near the Ice; it may be
by rea&s;on of the &s;hallow ground or bottom,
and the many fre&s;h Rivers that run into it; or
becau&s;e the Fro&s;t cleareth the water more.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner of their Sailing; they
&s;ail and change their Ways and Sails according
as they think fit. If there be a fre&s;h Gale, they
make u&s;e of all their Sails; if a &s;torm, with the
two lowermo&s;t Sails, whereof they call the fir&s;t
the <HI>Fock</HI> or <HI>Fore-&s;ail,</HI> the middlemo&s;t <HI>Schumfer</HI> or
<HI>Main-&s;ail,</HI> and the third the <HI>Ba&s;an</HI> or <HI>Mizen-&s;ail.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="152">
In hard &s;torms they furl the fore Sail, and
&s;ail only with the Main-Sail and the <HI>Mizen-&s;ail.</HI></P>
<P>In the greate&s;t &s;torm of all, with the&s;e Sails
reefed or half tied in, as they call it, or with
the Mizen-&s;ail half furled up; this they do
becau&s;e the Ship goeth the &s;tedier by rea&s;on
of the wind, for el&s;e it would rowle too much
up and down in the Sea, and the water would
da&s;h in too much on the &s;ides thereof.</P>
<P>One man &s;tands always at the Helm to &s;teer
the Ship, but in hard weather ten men can
hardly hold the Helm, wherefore they fa&s;ten
it with a Tackle, and &s;o let it go too and fro,
as the Compa&s;s directs them.</P>
<P>In and after a &s;torm we have oftentimes
&s;trangers come to vi&s;it us in our Ships, <HI>viz.
Blackbirds, Starlings,</HI> and all &s;orts of &s;mall Birds,
that have lo&s;t their way in a &s;torm from the and,
and fly to the Ships to &s;ave them&s;elves, and
prolong their lives, when others fly about till
they are &s;pent, and then fall into the Sea, and
are drowned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lumbs,</HI> and other Water-fowl, come not
near us; which I mention on purpo&s;e to con|fute
the erroneons Opinion of &s;ome, that be|lieve
that the before-mentioned Birds come to
the Ships as Me&s;&s;engers, to bring the ill news
of bad weather.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding, the&s;e following &s;igns or
marks commonly fore-tell a &s;torm or hard
weather, when great fi&s;h come near to the
Ships in great numbers, when they play, dance,
rowl about, and leap out of the water, which
is not always playing in them, but rather their
Bodies are afflicted with &s;ome pain or other.
We &s;aw &s;everal <HI>Whales</HI> in the Sea, that threw
<PB N="32" REF="153">
them&s;elves about as if they were &s;ick, or a
dying.</P>
<P>When the Sea is tempe&s;tuous, it is not to
be thought that it doth proceed from the Sea
only, but a hard and tempe&s;tuous &s;torm and
wind followeth upon it, that &s;endeth the Waves
like Me&s;&s;engers before it, until it arriveth it
&s;elf with a tempe&s;t; but this is not to be un|der&s;tood
of the North-&s;ea, but only of the
Sea betwixt <HI>Hitland</HI> and <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>When the Air is &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as the Stars do
not only look bigger, but as if they were more
in number al&s;o, it is a great Progno&s;tication,
and often proveth true al&s;o; It is a &s;ign that
the Air is full of Mi&s;t, which cau&s;eth upon
changing of the Fro&s;t, great foggs, and a high
wind follows &s;oon after.</P>
<P>At night, when the Sea da&s;heth very much,
it &s;hines like fire, the Sea-men call it burning:
This &s;hining is a very bright glance, like unto
the lu&s;tre of a Diamond.</P>
<P>But when the Sea &s;hines vehemently in a
dark night, and burns; a South or We&s;t-wind
followeth after it.</P>
<P>At the &s;tern of the Ship, where the water is
cut through, you &s;ee at night deep under
water, bubbles ri&s;e and break, then this &s;hining
or lu&s;tre is not there.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have di&s;cour&s;ed of the North-&s;ea,
but next of the Waves between <HI>Hitland</HI> and
<HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> near <HI>Hitland</HI> the &s;tream runneth
very &s;wift toward the North, and it grows daily
colder.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that here the Waves of
the Sea run longer, almo&s;t as they do before
the narrow Channel between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h Sea,</HI> (and what hath been
<PB N="33" REF="153">
ob&s;erved heretofore of the rowling and to&s;|&s;ing
of the Sea belongeth properly to this)
with a continual to&s;&s;ing of the Ships, which
maketh the men Sea-&s;ick.</P>
<P>The vomiting and &s;ickne&s;s is attributed to
the Sea-water; but it really proceedeth from
the great and continual motion of the Body,
when oftentimes we are forced to creep on all
four.</P>
<P>Neither Meat nor Drink ta&s;ts well, the head
akes and is giddy, and they are always reach|ing
to vomit. Co&s;tivene&s;s of the Body doth
generally accompany this Di&s;temper, and the
Urine is highly tinged. I reckon it no more
then if one is not u&s;ed to ride in Coaches or
Waggons; only that it is always accompanied
with a bad &s;tomach and re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Remedies for this Di&s;temper, I
believe, are Aromaticks chewed in ones mouth,
as Cinamon, Cloves, Galengal, Ginger, Nut|megs,
and the like. Many think to drive this
Di&s;temper away with fa&s;ting, but they will
find them&s;elves mi&s;taken. Some drink Sea-water,
and believe that will make them vo|mit,
which notwith&s;tanding is not occa&s;ioned
by the Sea-water, but by the loath&s;omne&s;s there|of.</P>
<P>To take away the ill ta&s;te out of ones
mouth, in my opinion, the be&s;t means is to
eat and drink plentifully, it ea&s;eth quickly;
neither ought one to &s;leep too much, but keep
in the Air, and look into the Wind, and to
walk up and down in the Ship, is al&s;o very
proper.</P>
<P>But now let us return to the Waves again,
they ri&s;e, although it be not windy, as high
as Mountains, very &s;mooth, and run away as
<PB N="34" REF="154">
far as one can di&s;cern them, which is to be
under&s;tood when the Sea is turbulent, where|upon
quickly a hard Gale of wind followeth.
In a &s;torm the Waves run after the &s;ame man|ner,
as is ju&s;t now &s;aid, but with many curl|ing
and foaming whirls, as is de&s;cribed in the
&s;torm of the North-&s;ea. The&s;e Waves run a
great way, &s;o that you may &s;ee between them
at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>If any Ships be in your Company, often|times
you cannot &s;ee them.</P>
<P>There Waves are a great deal larger then in
the North-&s;ea, and have al&s;o greater power
when they fall over, but do not da&s;h &s;o ea&s;ily
over the Ships as they do in the North-&s;ea.
The Waves in the North-&s;ea are pre&s;ently lay'd
after a &s;torm, but the commotion of the&s;e la&s;t|eth
often to the third day; if it be never &s;o
calm, the Ships are moved very violently,
that you cannot walk, &s;it, or lie; it is be&s;t
to keep in the middle of the Ship, for before
and behind the Sea beats hard again&s;t them.
The Sails are driven again&s;t the Ma&s;ts, and
have no &s;teadine&s;s from the wind. If in a brisk
Gale of a full wind the Sails are all full and
round, the Ship &s;ails be&s;t upon the Sea.</P>
<P>There is as great difference in Ships, as to
&s;ailing, as there is in Hor&s;es, concerning
ea&s;ine&s;s and &s;wiftne&s;s; the motion of the
Ships is therefore different; the &s;tilne&s;s
and quietne&s;s, when nothing is tumbled up
and down in the Ship, furthereth al&s;o &s;ailing
very much.</P>
<P>The Ships &s;wim &s;omething higher in the
Sea then they do in Fre&s;h-water; for there is
almo&s;t a foot difference in a ship with the &s;ame
loading. 'Tis generally agreed upon, that one
<PB N="35" REF="154">
may &s;ee a Ship in a calm Sea three, or three
and a half <HI>German</HI> Miles off, and beyond that
di&s;tance the Sea lo&s;eth it &s;elf in the Air, and
the Air in the Sea. If a Ship &s;aileth on the
main Sea at one and half <HI>German</HI> Miles di|&s;tance,
you have lo&s;t the &s;ight of half the
Ship; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t two Miles you &s;ee only the upper|mo&s;t
Ma&s;t, at three Miles di&s;tance you &s;ee
only the Flagg, and when it goeth farther, you
have quite lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>Land and Mountains may be &s;een at a great
di&s;tance at Sea; we &s;aw <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> at twelve
Miles di&s;tance off at Sea; the Country looked
like a black Cloud full of white &s;troaks, as is in

the Ice of this Sea it is colde&s;t where the Waves
are quiet; and the Sea-water is &s;o clear, that
at twelve and more Fathoms deep you may
&s;ee the bottom. There is no ground to be
found near the Ice to drop an Anchor.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that according
to the colour of the Skies, the colour of
the Sea is changed. If the Skies be clear,
the sea looks as blew as a Saphir; if it
is covered &s;omewhat with Clouds, the Sea
is as green as an Emerald; if there be a fog|gy
Sun-&s;hine, it looketh yellow; if it be
quite dark, like unto the colour of <HI>Indico;</HI> in
&s;tormy and cloudy weather, like black Sope,
or exactly like unto the colour of black Lead.</P>
<P>If the wind be quite calm, one may hear
beating or knocking at a great di&s;tance on the
the Sea, by which we al&s;o ob&s;erve the <HI>Whale</HI>
hears, as &s;hall be mentioned in its proper
place.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="155">
Among the Ice the &s;tream runs South|wards,
which we ob&s;erved by our driving
back a great way. At the <HI>Mu&s;cle-Haven</HI> the
&s;tream ran Northwards. Tho&s;e that &s;ail year|ly
to tho&s;e places, cannot give any certain in|formation
concerning ebbing and flowing;
only they have ob&s;erved the water to be high|er
about the Land, when the winds have
been higher then at other times. And this I

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ICE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May</HI> the we&s;t
Ice breaks, becau&s;e it lyeth We&s;tward,
which drives di&s;per&s;ed in the Sea, by the
I&s;land of <HI>John Mayen,</HI> and reacheth to <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
where at that time it was firm &s;till, as
you may &s;ee in the Plate <HI>A</HI> marked with <HI>e.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between the Ice of <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
and that of our Country, is, that it is
not &s;mooth there, &s;o as to &s;lide upon it.</P>
<P>Neither is it &s;o clear nor tran&s;parent, nor
&s;o &s;harp and cutting, but a great deal harder,
and is not ea&s;ily broke or &s;plit; but it looketh
like&s;t unto the Ground-Ice of the Rivers in our
Country, or like unto Loaf-&s;ugar.</P>
<P>Where the Ice is fixed upon the Sea, you
&s;ee a &s;now-white brighte&s;s in the Skies, as if
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he Sun &s;hined, for the Snow is reflected by

<P>The Sea da&s;heth again&s;t the&s;e Ice-fields,

<PB N="38" REF="156">
Tables, Chappels, and all &s;ort of Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>These Ice-fields are a great deal deeper un|der
water, then they are high above it, and
are of a paler colour under water then above;
the top of them might be called the Kernel
and Marrow of the Ice, becau&s;e the colour is
much deeper then that of the other.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t colour is delicate blew, of the
&s;ame colour with the blewe&s;t Vitriol, &s;omewhat
more tran&s;parent, yet not &s;o clear as that in
our Country, which you may &s;ee through, let
it be never &s;o thick; it is as hard as a &s;tone, and
it is not ea&s;ily &s;plit or cleav'd, becau&s;e it is
&s;pumgy, like unto a Punice &s;tone. Among
this Ice the Ships &s;ail up and down, until they
come to bigger Ice fields, for the &s;mall ones
incumber the Sea, that the Ships &s;ail often a|gain&s;t
them and peri&s;h; for when the winds
ari&s;e the Waves drive again&s;t the Ice-fields, as
if it was again&s;t Rocks, and beat the Ships to
pieces.</P>
<P>When we are pa&s;&s;ed by the&s;e &s;mall Ice-fields
that &s;wim at a great di&s;tance from one
another, then we &s;ail in between them, and
draw a &s;mall Ice-field behind the &s;tern of our
Ship, that it may be the &s;ooner &s;topt, and
kept from &s;wift &s;ailing, without letting the
Sails &s;trike, for el&s;e it might ea&s;ily run again&s;t
an Ice-field. Every Ships Ma&s;ter is left to his
free-will, whether he will &s;ail into the Ice, be|cau&s;e
in the Spring the <HI>Whales</HI> are in great
numbers &s;een there in the <HI>We&s;t-Ice,</HI> as they call
it.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ters do not willingly &s;ail in a|mong&s;t
the Ice, when it is dark, or foggy, or
&s;tormy, which mu&s;t be expected in the Spring,
and the &s;mall &s;heets of Ice &s;wim up and down
<PB N="39" REF="156">
in the Sea, which the Skippers mu&s;t avoid,
le&s;t they lo&s;e their Ships.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;omething &s;trange, that they
&s;ail &s;o often to the Ice and back again but there
is the &s;ame rea&s;on for it as is in hunting after
Deer, if we do not find Whales in one place,
we mu&s;t &s;eek them in others; for the fortune
in ketching of <HI>Whales</HI> is like the Chances of
Gaming, and there is no great under&s;tanding
required to find them: &s;ome &s;ee and catch
more then they de&s;ire, and others but at half
a mile di&s;tant from them, &s;ee not one, which is
very common.</P>
<P>When they go in among&s;t the Ice, the
men &s;tand ready with great Ice-hooks to keep
them off, that the Ship may not run again&s;t
them.</P>
<P>The farther you &s;ail into, and among&s;t the
Ice, the greater Ice-fields you &s;hall foe, &s;o that
you cannot look over them; for about the
We&s;t, as they call it, are larger Ice-fields to be
&s;een then about <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> quite white at the
top, covered with Snow, &s;o that there is but
ill walking upon them, becau&s;e you fall deep
into the Snow. (See <HI>A</HI> marked with <HI>l,</HI> and
<HI>B</HI> marked <HI>c.</HI>)</P>
<P>The prints of the <HI>Bears</HI> footing we &s;aw on
the &s;hoar of the Ice-fields, for they &s;eek their
Prey in the water, which is the dead Carka&s;es
of the <HI>Whales,</HI> the <HI>Foxes</HI> generally accompany
them, for their choicer food of Birds is here
&s;carcer then at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for they flock not
together, but fly &s;ingly.</P>
<P>When they &s;ail &s;ome Miles into the Ice,
where there is pretty large Ice-fields, they joyn
their Ships to them with great Ice-hooks, fa&s;t|ned
to &s;trong Cables, where they lie at An|chor,
<PB N="40" REF="157">
&s;everal Ships about the &s;ame Ice-field,
but they rather cho&s;e to be alone, becau&s;e they
are an hindrance to one another in <HI>Whale</HI>-catching,
and the hunting of them from one
to another maketh them &s;hie.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Ice we find no great Waves,
but it is pretty &s;mooth, even when it is &s;ome|what
&s;tormy. All the danger is from one Ice-field
being bigger then the other, and the
little ones &s;wiming fa&s;ter then the great ones,
which often cau&s;eth a &s;toppage, &s;o that they
crowd upon one another, not without great
danger of the Ships, which are often catcht
between, and broken by them. See the Plate <HI>B</HI>
at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>The Seamen hinder the pre&s;&s;ing on of the
Ice as much as in them lieth, with great Ice-hooks;
but what &s;mall help this affordeth them
daily experience te&s;tifies &s;ufficienty. In fair
weather the mi&s;chief is as &s;oon done as in
tempe&s;tuous, becau&s;e the Ice drives in the Sea
either with the &s;tream or wind, as either of
them is the more prevalent, cra&s;hing and grind|ing
again&s;t each other whence the danger ari&s;es
to the Ships, for after &s;uch a manner many
Ships peri&s;h. See Plate <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ay that a dead <HI>Whale</HI> tied to the Ship,
is the be&s;t defence again&s;t the Ice. Others
hang the Tails and Fins about their Ship, which
way is not to be rejected, for it is of great u&s;e
to them to prevent the danger of the &s;queez|ing
of the Ice; they have examples, that in
&s;uch &s;queezing of the Ice a dead <HI>Whale</HI> hath
pre&s;erved them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="157">
The Ice ri&s;es out of the Sea as high as a
Mountain; the &s;triking of them together
makes &s;o great a noi&s;e, that one can hardly
hear his own words; and from this joyning
together of the Ice, the great Ice-hills are
made, that drive up and down in the Sea.</P>
<P>Other great Ice fields are not &s;o high as the
Ice hills, yet notwith&s;tanding they are hard|ly
ever quite plain, and without a Hill; you
&s;ee the Ice under water as deep as you can &s;ee.
It is all of a blew colour, but the deeper you
look the purer blew you &s;ee; which beautiful
colour changes with the Air, for if it be rainy
weather, this colour groweth paler. I al&s;o
have often &s;een the Ice underneath the water
very green, the occa&s;ion whereof was the
troubled Air, whence the Sea a&s;&s;umeth this
colour.</P>
<P>I wonder that upon the large&s;t Ice-fields
no high Mountains are &s;een, as are &s;een where
the Ice grinds and da&s;hes one again&s;t the o|ther.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that the Ice melts to|wards
the bottoms, for one may &s;ee it &s;pungy;
for el&s;e, if one would compute from the be|ginning,
it mu&s;t have reached the very
ground, even in the middle of the depth of
the sea.</P>
<P>I have &s;een in <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> white Ice that
was frozen quite curled, it look'd ju&s;t like Su|gar-candy,
was very hard and thick, and
&s;wam even with the Seas &s;urface. The Ships
are not always in this danger of &s;qeezing,
for often times there is little or no Ice to be
&s;een there, although you are a great way in
the place where it u&s;ually is; but as &s;oon as a
wind ari&s;es, you would admire from whence
<PB N="42" REF="158">
&s;o great a quantity of Ice &s;hould come in le&s;s
then an hours time.</P>
<P>At the greate&s;t Ice-fields of all, Ships do not
always ride the &s;afe&s;t; &s;ince by rea&s;on of the
bigne&s;s, and the motion of the Sea, the&s;e Ice-fields
break, not without danger.</P>
<P>When &s;uch Ice-fields break they part a|&s;under,
which cau&s;eth a Whirl-pool in the
Sea, where all the out-parts pre&s;s to the Cen|tre,
and by that means the pieces of the Ice-fields
rai&s;e them&s;elves up, and da&s;h and grind
again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>When we came to 71 degrees in the
Month of <HI>April</HI> we &s;aw the fir&s;t Ice, and &s;o
we failed up and down by the Ice, until that
Month was &s;pent, for &s;o early in the year no
body dares venture him&s;elf into or among&s;t
the Ice, by rea&s;on of the &s;tormy winds&punc; and
&s;ome times the Ice is &s;till fixed, and &s;tands
firm, and therefore there is but a few <HI>Whales</HI>
&s;een, for underneath the Ice they cannot
breathe.</P>
<P>Into the Ice we &s;ailed at 77 degrees and
24 minutes, and drove with that &s;heet of Ice
towards the South. In this Month, and al&s;o
in the following Month of <HI>May,</HI> are the mo&s;t
<HI>Whales</HI> &s;een here, which run towards the Ea&s;t,
and we follow them all along by the Ice to
<HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>Near to the Land &s;maller Ice-fields are &s;een,
becau&s;e the Ice cannot give way by rea&s;on
of the Land, which cau&s;eth greater grinding
and breaking, and upon that account &s;maller
Ice than is in the open Sea. Yet for all this,
&s;ome greater Ice-Mountains are &s;een there,
that &s;tand firm on the &s;hoar, and never melt
at bottom, but increa&s;e every year higher and
<PB N="43" REF="158">
higher, by rea&s;on of the Snow that falls on
them, and then Rains that freezes, and then
Snow again alternately; and after this manner
the Icy-hills increa&s;e yearly, and are never
melted by the heat of the Sun at the top.
The&s;e Ice-Mounts change their fir&s;t colour in
time by the Air, by Rain and by the Clouds;
and the faire&s;t blew that can be, is &s;een in
the cracks of the&s;e Ice-hills. From the&s;e &s;ame
Ice-hills, oftentimes break off great pieces,
that &s;win in the Sea, and is more compact
than the other Ice by far. I once &s;aw one of
the&s;e pieces that was curiou&s;ly workt and car|ved,
as it were, by the Sea, like a Church with
arched Windows and Pillars, the Doors and
Windows hung full of Icikles, on the in&s;ide
thereof I &s;aw the delicate&s;t blew that can be
imagined; it was bigger than our Ship, and
&s;omewhat higher than our &s;tern, but how deep
it was under water, I cannot exactly tell.
Near unto the <HI>Mu&s;cle-Haven,</HI> a great Ice-hill
came driving towards our Ship, that was as
high as our Poop, and went &s;o deep under
water, that it took up our Anchor, which lay
fifteen Fathoms deep. I have al&s;o &s;een &s;everal
others, and of other figures, <HI>viz.</HI> round and
four&s;quare Tables, with round and blew Pil|lars
underneath, as in Plate <HI>B</HI> marked with <HI>f:</HI>
the Table was very &s;mooth and plain at the
top, and white with the Snow; at the &s;ides
hung down a great many Icikles clo&s;e to one
another, like a fringed Table-cloth; I believe
that near forty men might have &s;at about it.
I have &s;een of the&s;e Tables with one foot, and
with two or three Pillars, and abundance of
<HI>Seales</HI> &s;wam about it. The Di&s;hes that furni&s;ht
this Table, were a piece of Ice like an Hor&s;es
<PB N="44" REF="159">
head, and a Swan, I doubt they were but &s;alt.
You mu&s;t ob&s;erve that this Ice becometh very
&s;pungy by the da&s;hing of the Sea, and from
thence grows &s;alt, like Sea-water, and thence
al&s;o changeth its colour, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Sea
and Rain-water mixt with it; for you &s;hall
commonly &s;ee the Water look blew or yellow,
if you walk under water, with your eyes open,
and look upwards.</P>
<P>The other Ice, as far as it is above water, is
of a ta&s;te like other Ice, but that below the
Sea &s;alt like the Sea-water.</P>
<P>When we arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> the Ice at
<HI>Rehenfelt</HI> was as yet fixed, but a few days after|wards
it was driven away by the winds.</P>
<P>The Ice begirts the&s;e Countries on all &s;ides:
as the Wind &s;ets either from the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>John
Mayen, Old Greenland,</HI> and <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> We
found at this time, that the Ice reached from
the other &s;ide of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and the Ships
&s;ailed between the Ice and the Land, as if it
were in a River.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this Ice is drove thither by the
winds, the Ships mu&s;t give way, or go into
the Harbour, until the Winds have blown
or driven the Ice away, or el&s;e they are lo&s;t;
but if there be other Ships that e&s;cape, the men
are &s;aved.</P>
<P>On this Ice I did not &s;ee many <HI>Sea-hounds,</HI>
but a great many <HI>Sea-hor&s;es,</HI> and many Birds
and Fowl.</P>
<P>We failed &s;till on till we &s;aw the <HI>Seven I&s;lands,</HI>
but could go no farther.</P>

<P>THE Fro&s;t is uncon&s;tant in our Coun|try
but it is not &s;o in <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> In
the Month of <HI>April,</HI> at 71 degrees, it was &s;o
cold that we could hardly keep warmth with|in
us. They &s;ay that in this Month, as al&s;o in
<HI>May,</HI> the harde&s;t Fro&s;ts happen every year.</P>
<P>All the Rigging, by rea&s;on of its being wet,
is covered over with Ice, and &s;tiff.</P>
<P>They do not &s;end their Ships &s;o &s;oon as
they did a few years ago, and yet they come
time enough there, for if they arrive too
early, there is nothing for them to do, becau&s;e
the Ice is not yet di&s;&s;ipated, and therefore
but few <HI>Whales</HI> to be &s;een.</P>
<P>In the two fir&s;t Summer Months of <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
their Teeth chatter in their Heads com|monly,
and the Appetite is greater than in any
other Countreys.</P>
<P>The Sun &s;ets no more after the third day
of <HI>May,</HI> and we were about 71 degrees,
when we could &s;ee as well by night as by day.
I cannot &s;ay much of con&s;tancy of the wea|ther
in the&s;e two fir&s;t Months, for it chang|ed
daily. They &s;ay al&s;o, if the Moon appears
cloudy and mi&s;ty, with a &s;treaky Sky, that
then there commonly follows a &s;torm. Whe|ther
the Moon doth progno&s;ticate &s;uch &s;torms,
I cannot tell, becau&s;e we have ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="46" REF="160">
after we have seen the Moon, in a clear Sky, the
Air has grown foggy, which happeneth of|ten,
chiefly if the wind changes. When the
Hills &s;how fiery, it is from Foggs, which af|ter
&s;pread them&s;elves every where, and the
Cold encrea&s;eth: The&s;e Foggs look blew, like
<HI>Indico,</HI> and black afar off, which upon chang|ing
of the Weather are driven along by the
wind, &s;o that in le&s;s than half an hour the Sea
is &s;o covered with a thick Fogg, that you
can hardly &s;ee from one end of the Ship to the
other.</P>
<P>On the 14th of <HI>May</HI> the Air was bright
and clear, and yet very cold; we could &s;ee
the <HI>Whales</HI> farther off in the Sea, then u&s;ually
at this time: We could not di&s;tinguish the
Air from the Sea, for it &s;hewed as if the
Ships danced in the Air like naked Trees or
P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">es.</P>
<P>After the &s;ame manner <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> looks at
a di&s;tance like a Cloud; the Mountains are &s;o
reflected by the Sea, that he that knows not
the Country very well, cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cern
if from the Air; and &s;o other Countries very
often appear. The other three Months, <HI>June,
July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> were very calm.</P>
<P>Concerning the Cold, it is much according
to the quality of the Winds; &s;o North and Ea&s;t
winds cau&s;e very inten&s;e Fro&s;ts; &s;o that one
can hardly keep alive, e&s;pecially if the wind
blows hard.</P>
<P>We&s;t and South winds, when &s;omewhat
con&s;tant, cau&s;e much Snow, and &s;ometimes
Rain al&s;o, and moderate cold.</P>
<P>The other winds of the 32 according
to the Compa&s;s, whatever names they have,
are changed by the Clouds, &s;o that &s;ometimes
<PB N="47" REF="160">
when the wind was Southwe&s;t and by South
in one place, at a few Miles di&s;tance, there
blows quite another wind.</P>
<P>What heat the Sun oftentimes affords we
&s;aw by our Eyes watering, and the tears that
ran continually down our Cheeks. Yet this
&s;evere Cold is not always, as is already men|tioned,
for if it were, how could any Herbs
grow there.</P>
<P>Neither is there every year a con&s;tancy of
winds or weather ruled by the Moon, but an
alteration, as is in other places, &s;ometimes a
milder, and &s;ometimes a &s;everer Winter.</P>
<P>Skilful Ship ma&s;ters and Harpooners, com|mend
tho&s;e years for <HI>Whale</HI> catching, that have
not many foggy and cloudy days.</P>
<P>Whether, according to the New and Full
Moons, the Spring-tydes happen, cannot be
known.</P>
<P>Such clear Skies as we have &s;ometimes in a
Summers day, with plea&s;ant curled Clouds, I
have not &s;een at <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> but on the con|trary,
&s;everal dark and foggy ones. Ri&s;ing
Thunder-clouds I have not &s;een, nor ever
heard of any body that had &s;een them.</P>
<P>Above the Ice the Air appears white, from
whence we know where the firm or fixed Ice
lies, as I have before ob&s;erved in the Chapter
of the Ice.</P>
<P>In the two la&s;t Summer Months, chiefly in
<HI>July,</HI> before the <HI>Weigatt,</HI> the Sun &s;hin'd &s;o
warm, that the Tarr of the Ship between the
Seames, where the wind could not come at it,
melted.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="161">
There is hardly any difference of Cold be|tween
Night and day, yet at Night when the
Sun &s;hineth, it &s;eemeth to one that rightly
con&s;idereth it, as if it was only clear Moon|light,
&s;o that you may look upon the Sun, as
well as you can upon the Moon; &s;o that
thereby one may di&s;tingui&s;h Night and Day

as far as we went.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the Fro&s;t doth
not let a dead Body be con&s;umed ea&s;ily in
the Ground, as is already ob&s;erved, in the
Chapter of the De&s;cription of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in our Voyage
homeward, we ob&s;erved the Sun fir&s;t to
&s;et.</P>
<P>Concerning the Meteors generated in the
Air, I ob&s;erved that the <HI>Rime</HI> fell down in the
&s;hape of &s;mall Needles of Snow into the Sea,
and covered it as if it was &s;prinkled all over
with Du&s;t: the&s;e &s;mall Needles increa&s;ed more
and more, and lay as they fell cro&s;s one over
the other, and looked very like a Cobweb;
they are formed by the cold of the Air, and
increa&s;ed to that degree, that the Sea &s;eemed
covered by them, as with a Skin, or a tender
Ice, which had the ta&s;te of Fre&s;h-water; as
al&s;o the Sea-water that is taken up into the
high Air is changed, and falleth down again
in &s;weet or fre&s;h Rain.</P>
<P>This hapneth in clear Sun-&s;hine and inten&s;e
cold weather, and it falleth down as the Dew
doth with us at Night invi&s;ibly, in dull wea|ther;
when the Sun doth not &s;hine, you can|not
&s;ee this; but you &s;ee it plainly, if you look
when the Sun &s;hines towards a &s;hady place;
<PB N="49" REF="161">
for then it &s;parkles as bright as Diamonds;
&s;hews like the Atoms in Sun-&s;hine, all day
long it falleth in &s;o &s;mall Particles, that no|thing

make them wet.</P>
<P>At Noon when the Sun &s;hines very warm,
the&s;e &s;mall Needles melt in the Air, and fall

<P>Sometimes we &s;ee in our Country, &s;ome|thing
a little like the&s;e &s;mall Needles, which

Trees in Atoms like Du&s;t. This is &s;mall Snow,
and may be &s;een as well in the Shade as in the
Sun. The&s;e Needles ar not the Exhalation
or Vapour that u&s;es in cold Weather, to &s;tick
to the Hair of Men and Bea&s;ts. I mu&s;t not
forget, that we &s;ee in the&s;e falling Needles a
Bow like a Rain-bow of two colours, white
and a pale yellow, like the Sun, reflected by
the dark Shadows of the Clouds.</P>
<P>After this I proceed to the De&s;cription of
an other Bow, which I call a Sea-bow. This
is &s;een when the Sun &s;hines clear and bright,
not in the great Waves, but in the Atmo&s;phere
of the Sea-water, which the Wind blows up,
and which looks like a Fog Commonly we &s;ee
this before the Ship, and &s;ometimes al&s;o be|hind
to the Lee-ward (&s;o they call that &s;ide of
the Ship towards the Sea) over-against the Sun,
where the Shadow of the Sail falleth. It is not
the Shadow of the Sail, but a Bow &s;heweth it
&s;elf in the Shadow of the Sail. We &s;ee this
plea&s;ant reflexion, in the &s;mall drops of the
Salt-water of &s;everal colours, like the Rain-bows
in the Skies, that are &s;een over-again&s;t the
dark Clouds.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="162">
This brings to my Mind another Phanome|non,
<HI>viz.</HI> that in the Clouds near the Sum, a
very bright Light is &s;een, like a Parelion or
Mock-&s;un. The&s;e Lights are called Weather-galls
by the Sea-men.</P>
<P>This bright Light we find in the lower-mo&s;t
Air, in the dark &s;hady Clouds, that are not
unlike to a Cloud of Rain, becau&s;e it is full of
drops, wherein the Sun is represented, as
things are in a Looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>This clearne&s;s of the Sun cau&s;eth a Heat,
which drives from it a Rain-bow, figured by
the Sun, which Bow are the Drops that by the
Heat of the Sun are changed into a Vapour
or Fog, and this Vapour &s;hews like &s;moak in
the Air, when the Cold remits, wherein the&s;e
Colours are no more &s;een.</P>
<P>But in the&s;e rai&s;ed Drops as afore&s;aid, the
Sun repre&s;ents it &s;elf, and cau&s;eth the&s;e Co|lours,
which are truly di&s;tinct, and repre&s;ent
Blew, Yellow and Red; which are the three
primary Colours of the Bow.</P>
<P>Concerning the bigne&s;s thereof, I did con&s;i|dered
and minded the Bow that I &s;aw in <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
and found that it moved about with the
Sun by Day and by Night, and that it appear|ed
much bigger in the Morning, Evening, and
at Night, than in the Day-time.</P>
<P>I will not mention the Whirlwinds which
are unknown in the&s;e cold Countries; that
u&s;ed to take up the Water into the Air: But
yet I will not omit the &s;mall Whirlwinds,
that proceed from the high Mountains, from
whence the Wind recoils, and &s;o turneth
round about.</P>

We &s;ee farther in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> that the Sea
as well as the other Waters, &s;ends forth a Va|pour,
when the Clold encrea&s;es, which Vapour
is turned into Rain in the Air, or into Snow,
and it &s;melleth like a Fog or &s;teaming Wa|ter.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e an Ob&s;ervation there, that
when we &s;ee great Vapours or Fogs in the Air,
and that &s;uch a Vapour ri&s;eth almo&s;t every
moment in a clear Sun-&s;hiny Day, without
Wind or other Cau&s;es, the cold Weather is a|bout
to remit: But when the Air is overbur|dened
by the&s;e Vapours, the Couds are di&s;&s;i|pated,
and they la&s;t a great while with con|&s;tant
Wind. Such Vapours as we &s;ee in

<P>Out of the&s;e &s;mall vaporous Drops the Snow

the&s;e following Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;tinctions,
Number 1. in the Plate of <HI>E.</HI> &s;heweth the
Snow that falleth, when it is tolerable cold
and rainy withal, then it falls like unto &s;mall
Ro&s;es, Needles and &s;mall Corns. When the
cold Weather doth remit the Snow falleth like
Stars, with many points like the Leaves of
Ferne. Plate <HI>E.</HI> Numb. 2. If it be only a
Fog at la&s;t, and it &s;noweth much, it looketh as you
&s;ee Numb. 3. If it is very cold and windy like
Numb. 4. When it is very cold and not windy
withal, the Snow falleth like unto Stars in a
clu&s;ter, becau&s;e the Wind cannot blow them
a&s;under, like Numb. 5. When the Wind was
<HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> or the Skies were thick of Clouds,
and it was &s;tormy withal, there fell Hail that
was round and oblong all over full of Prickles,
and of the &s;ame bigne&s;s as you &s;ee it as Num|ber
6.</P>
<P>There is many more &s;orts of &s;tarry Snow to
be &s;een, with more Points, and &s;ome like unto
a Heart, but they are all generated after the
&s;ame manner, by the Ea&s;tern and Northern
Winds. The needly Snow is generated by
We&s;terly and Southerly Winds: If the Snow
is not di&s;per&s;ed by the Wind, it falleth down
in cl;u&s;ters</P>
<P>But when the Wind driveth it, Stars, or
Needles only fall, every piece by it &s;elf, like
the Atoms in the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="164">
Thus much have I ob&s;erved hitherto of the
Snow, and find that al&s;o when it is cold and

The Root hath a great many Branches that

Plant groweth under Water &s;everal Fathoms:
When we wayed our Anchor, we pulled it
up in great quantity from the Ground.</P>
<P>Together with this Herbs we pulled up the
hairy Plant that &s;tands by it, about &s;ix Foot
long, and it is very like an Hor&s;es Tail, only
that here and there it hath &s;ome &s;mall knobs

<P>This Bird hath a &s;harp, narrow and thin
Bill, and hath only three Claws or Toes, that
are joined together by a black Skin, but he hath
no Claw behind. His Legs are not very long,
and black, as the Eyes are al&s;o.</P>
<P>This Bird is whiter than the Snow, for when
you &s;ee him upon the Ice, you may di&s;tingui&s;h
him from the Snow; he &s;hews very beautiful,
with his white Body, his black Bill and Eyes,
black Legs and Feet, and be&s;ides he is very

<P>His Tail is pretty long and broad, like a

<P>His Cry is &s;omewhat lower than the little

<HI>Kir,</HI> he &s;preads his Wings and Tail out when
he flies, as the <HI>Strundjager</HI> or Crow doth. He
doth not willingly &s;wim in the Water as the
other Birds do, nor doth he much care for
wetting his Feet, but he &s;tays rather where it
is dry, yet he loves Fi&s;h mightily; and &s;o the
Proverb that we commonly &s;ay of the Cats is
true of him; <HI>The Cat loves to eat Fi&s;h, but does
not love to wet her Feet.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een him upon the Ice feed on the
Dung of a Sea-hor&s;e, upon who&s;e Body he
will re&s;t while he is alive, as Crows will do
in our Countries. He flieth commonly alone
by him&s;elf, but where there is a Prey they
flock in great numbers.</P>
<P>I did delineate them in the &s;hallow Corner

<P>Some of the thick billed one have them di|vided

&s;ticks to their Feathers no more than on the
Swans and other Water Fowl, for it runs off
from them, as if they were oiled all over.</P>
<P>Some are Birds of Prey, others not. There
is al&s;o a difference in their flying.</P>
<P>Some flie like unto a Partridge, as that called
the Pigeon, others like Swallows, as the
<HI>Lumbs</HI> and <HI>Red Gee&s;e,</HI> others like the Mews, as

like the <HI>Stork,</HI> as the <HI>Burgermei&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Birds of Prey are, the <HI>Burgermei&s;ter,
Rath&s;her, Strundjager, Kutyegehf</HI> and <HI>Mallemucke.</HI>
There is al&s;o a great difference in their Fle&s;h;
the Birds of Prey are not &s;o good to eat as the
others, except you hang them up by their Legs
for &s;ome days, that the Train Oil may run
out of them, and the Air blow through them,
<PB N="76" REF="180">
and then you do not ta&s;te the Train Oil &s;o
&s;trong, for el&s;e it would make you vomit.</P>
<P>The Pigeons, Parrets, Red Gee&s;e and Ducks,
are the mo&s;t fle&s;hy, the old Lumbs have a very
tough and dry Fle&s;h, not to di&s;parage the Rotges,
Kirmews and young Lumbs when boiled, and
the Fat taken away from them, and afterwards
fryed in Butter; for then one may make a &s;hift
to eat them;but if you &s;hould eat their Fat, it
would vomit and di&s;order the Stomach very
much. Th&s;e Birds except the <HI>Strundjager,
Kirmew</HI> and <HI>Mountain-duck,</HI> all make their Ne&s;ts
upon the high Rocks, where they are &s;ecured
from the Foxes and Bears;but &s;ome of them
make their Ne&s;ts higher than others.</P>
<P>They fit in &s;o great-numbers or flocks upon
the Rocks, chiefly at the time when they hatch
their Young ones, which is about the latter end
of <HI>June,</HI> and beginning of <HI>July,</HI> that if they
flie up when the Sun &s;hineth, they &s;hade the
Ground like a Cloud, and make &s;o great a noi&s;e,
that one Man can hardly hear the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kirmews</HI> and <HI>Mountain-ducks,</HI> and al&s;o
the <HI>Strundjagers.</HI> make their Ne&s;ts on low
Grouands, (that one would think that the high
Water mu&s;t needs run over them) on the &s;mall
I&s;lnds, where they are &s;ecure from the Foxes,
but not from the white Bears, for they &s;wim in
the Water from one I&s;lands to the other. We
took up great &s;tore of their Eggs.</P>
<P>The Ne&s;ts of the&s;e Birds are not all made
after the &s;ame manner. For the <HI>Mountains-duck</HI>
makes its Ne&s;t of the Feathers of its own Belly,
mixing them with Mo&s;s.</P>
<P>The Feathers of the&s;e Ne&s;ts are not the
Edder Down, brought us from I&s;land, for
that cometh from great Birds (that the Inhabi|tants)</P>

<HEAD>II. Of the Snow-bird.</HEAD>

<P>The Bill is &s;hort and pointed, its Head of
the &s;ame thickne&s;s with its Neck. The Legs

into three fore Claws, with longi&s;h crooked

Legs are grayi&s;h, and not very long.</P>
<P>From their Head over all their Belly to the

<P>I can tell nothing of its &s;inging, only that
it whi&s;&s;eleth a little, as Birds u&s;e to do when

<P>When we &s;ailed near the Ice, they came in
great flocks to us in our Ship, near the I&s;land
of <HI>John Mayen,</HI> and were &s;o tame, that you

<HEAD>II. Of the Pigeon.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Pigeon,</HI> or rather the <HI>Pigeon-diver,</HI> is al|&s;o
one of the beautifulle&s;t Birds of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI>
It is of the bigne&s;s of a Duck, the Bill is &s;ome|what
long, thin and &s;harp pointed, at the
point the upper Bill is &s;omewhat crooked, a|bout
two Inches long and hollow within. It
hath but three red Toes on its Feet, with
crooked Claws; it hath &s;hort redi&s;h Legs, and
a &s;hort Tail.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Birds are black all their body
over; but others. and &s;o was that which I de|lineated;
about their Wings, and in the middle
they are white pyed with black, but under|neath
the Wings they are quite white; others
are in the middle of their Wings quite white;
their Bill is red within; the Tongue is al&s;o
red and hollow; they cry like young Pigeons,
whence they have their Name, for they are in
nothing el&s;e like them. In their Crops I found
Shrimps, or Prawns, and &s;mall Sand-&s;tones.</P>
<P>They do not flie high over the Sea, and
their flight is very like the Partridges: They
do not flie many together as the Lumbs, but
u&s;ually by pares, and &s;ometimes one alone by
its &s;elf.</P>
<P>They can keep a great while under Water;
wherefore they may be called Diving Pigeons.</P>
<P>But chiefly when they are pur&s;ed by Men, or
if their Wings be hurt by a Shot, they will dive
and keep a great while under Water; and &s;ome|times
they get underneath the Ice, and there
they are &s;uffocated, they were as nimble and quick
under Water (if their Wings or Feet are not quite
&s;hot off) as we could row with our Boat. Their
<PB N="80" REF="183">
Fle&s;h is good to eat when the Fat is taken a|way
from it, if afterwards it be fryed in But|ter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Diving Pigeon I got the 23<HI>th.</HI> of
<HI>May</HI> on the Ice, and afterward at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI>

<HEAD>III. Of the Lumb.</HEAD>
<P>This Bird is the like&s;t in his Bill unto the
Diving Pigeon, only it is &s;omewhat &s;tronger
and crookeder.</P>
<P>He hath black Feet, with three black Toes,
and as many black Nails; his Legs are black
al&s;o and &s;hort.</P>
<P>He is quite black at the top, but underneath
his Belly even to the Neck he is &s;now white;
his Tail is &s;hort.</P>
<P>His Cry is very unplea&s;ant, mo&s;t like that of
a Raven, and they cry more than all the o|ther
Birds, except the <HI>Rotger-divers,</HI> he is big|ger
than the Diving Pigeon, as big as a mid|ling
Duck. In their Crops I find &s;mall Fi&s;h
and Prawns, and al&s;o &s;ome Sand-&s;tones; and
one of them flying over our Ship dropp'd a
large red Prawn into the Ship. I al&s;o delinea|ted
it in the mentioned place. They &s;ay
likewi&s;e, that &s;mall fre&s;h River Fish are their
Prey; but this I cannot relate for certain.</P>
<P>When they have young ones, they common|ly
&s;it by the old ones one or two on the Water,
who teach them to dive and &s;wim. After the
old ones have brought their young in their
Bill, from the Rocks to the Water, the Prey|ing
Bird called <HI>Burgermei&s;ter</HI> &s;ometimes catches
the young ones, when the old ones are not
<PB N="81" REF="183">
pre&s;ent, and &s;ometimes when they are al&s;o, for
they are not able to re&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>They love their young ones &s;o well, that
they will be killed before they will leave them,
(and will defend them as a Hen doth her
Chickens, &s;wimming about them) at other
times they are very hard to be &s;hot; for as
&s;oon as they &s;ee the Fire, they are immediately
under Water, or fly away. They fly in great
flocks, with pointed Wings like Swallows, and
move their Wings much in their flight. One
can hardly know the young <HI>Lumbs</HI> from the
old ones, at the first &s;ight, if you do not take
exact notice of their Bills; for the upper part
turns be&s;ide the under part, at the point, and
the undermo&s;t be&s;ide the uppermo&s;t, as you &s;ee
in the Cro&s;s Bill, yet not so much in these;
and it is commonly done in the 15th, 16th, to
the 20th year of their Age. The old ones are
full of Fle&s;h, but it is very dry and tough, and
therefore unplea&s;ant to eat.</P>
<P>They boil them like the Pigeons, and &s;cum
off the Fat when they boil, then they fry them
in Batter. I did not &s;ee them upon the Ice,
but abundance of them upon the Mountains:
They go waddling from one &s;ide to the other,
like the diving Pigeons. I have &s;een many
Thou&s;ands of them together in the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Har|bour,
on the Mountains, on that &s;ide where the
Ea&s;t and Northern Winds could not blow hard
or not fully upon them, (and &s;o do all other
Birds chu&s;e &s;uch places on the Mountains for
their Habitations) where the Herbs do grow.</P>

a Bill &s;omewhat bent, as the <HI>Burgermei&s;ter;</HI> on

<P>All the Belly is as white as Snow; the

Wings black. He is almo&s;t as big as an ordi|nary
<HI>Mew,</HI> but &s;omething le&s;s than the <HI>Strunt-jager.</HI>
When we cut the fat off from the
Whales, we &s;aw abundance of them fly by the

<P>When the Seamen have a mind to catch
&s;ome of them, they bait their Hooks with a
piece of Whales Fat, and &s;o tye the Hooks to
a Line, and fling it into the Sea, and &s;o they
catch not only the&s;e, but all the other Birds of

(in Engli&s;h <HI>Dung-hunter</HI>) who leave him
not till he dungs, which the <HI>Strunt-jager</HI>

the Wind, if it was never &s;o great a Storm;

upon the Water together.</P>
<P>This is not only to be under&s;tood of this
Bird, but al&s;o of all the re&s;t, for they look
again&s;t the Wind, that their Feathers may not
be blown a&s;under and opened; for if they
&s;hould &s;it or &s;wim with the Wind, their Fea|thers
would be blown a&s;under by the cold
Wind, and &s;o the Cold would get in between
them to their Skin, which perhaps might pre|judice
their Health, for Birds are covered with
their Feathers as Men are with their Clothes.</P>
<P>And &s;o, when they fly up, they pre&s;s again&s;t
the Wind with their Bodies, and expand their
Wings, and &s;o fly away very &s;wiftly; al&s;o their
Feathers would be entangled, &s;o that they
could not have a &s;ure and &s;teddy flight, but
faulter in their flying, like Birds that learn to
fly. There is but little Meat upon them; we
eat but the Legs and the Brea&s;t, for the Wings
are nothing but Skin and Bone. We have a
Proverb, and &s;ay, <HI>Thou art as light as a Mew:</HI>

The Drake hath black and white &s;potted Fea|thers,
<PB N="91" REF="190">
and the Duck hath Feathers of the co|lour
of a Partridge. The hindmo&s;t Claw is
broad and &s;hort, with a &s;hort Nail; the Tail
is bobb'd, like that of other Ducks. I could
find nothing in their Mews or Gizzards that
could make me certain of thier Food, but only
Sand-&s;tones. They fly a great many of them
in flocks like other wild Ducks; when they
do &s;ee any Men, they hold up their Heads and
make a very long Neck. They make their
Ne&s;ts upon the low I&s;lands; they make them
of the Feathers of their Bellies, which they mix
with Mo&s;s; but the&s;e are not the &s;ame Feathers
which are called the Edder-down.</P>
<P>We found their Ne&s;ts with two, three, or
four Eggs in them, the mo&s;t whereof were rot|ten
when we came to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but &s;ome of
them were good to eat; they are of a pale
green, &s;omewhat bigger than our Duck-eggs;
the Seamen made an hole at each end, and &s;o
blew the White and the Yolk out, and &s;trung
the Shells upon a Packthread. I would have
brought &s;ome of them to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but they
began to &s;tink, &s;o that I was forced to fling
them away, although the Shells were entire.
The&s;e Ducks have a very good Fle&s;h, we boyl'd
and ro&s;ted them as we did the other Birds,
but the fat of them we flung away, for it ta&s;ted
of Train-oyl, and made us vomit.</P>
<P>The Ships that arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> before
us got a great many of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Mountain-Ducks</HI> are not at all &s;hy, or
afraid of Men, when we fir&s;t arrive there, but
afterwards they grow quite wild, &s;o that you
can hardly come near enough to &s;hoot them.

<HEAD>X. Of the Kirmew.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Kirmew</HI> hath a thin &s;harp-pointed Bill,
as red as Blood; the &s;hews very large, e&s;peci|ally
when &s;he &s;tands upright, becau&s;e of her
long Wings, and Feathers of her Tail, but
when the Feathers are off, there is no more
Meat than upon a Sparrow. It is peculiar to
this Bird to have very &s;harp pointed Wings,
and its Tail is longer than that of a Swallow,
and as long as the longe&s;t Feather of the Wings.
Becau&s;e of the&s;e long and &s;harp-pointed Fea|thers
in her Wing and Tail, &s;he might very
properly be called the <HI>Swallow-mew,</HI> but it is
commonly called <HI>Kirmew</HI> from its Cry. The
Claws, as well as the Skin between them, are as
red as Blood; the Nails are black on all the
four Claws; the hindmo&s;t Claw is very little:
The Legs are &s;hort and red: it &s;hews very
brisk and pert when it &s;tands upright on its
Legs. The Head at the top is black, like a
black Cap; the &s;ides of the Head are Snow
white, and the whole Body is of a Silver co|lour,
or white enclining to grey; the Wings
and Tail are white underneath; one &s;ide of the
Feathers of the Wings are black. All the&s;e
differing colours, together with the Blood-red
Bill, red Legs and Feet, make her very beauti|ful
her Feathers are thready or hairy; &s;he
flies &s;ingly, for &s;o I &s;aw her always in the <HI>South
Haven,</HI> and in other places where we were.
Where their Ne&s;ts are they fly in great num|bers;
The&s;e they make of Mo&s;s. One can hard|ly
<PB N="93" REF="191">
di&s;cern their Eggs from their Ne&s;ts, for both
of them are of a dirty white, but the Eggs have
black &s;pecks; they are of the bigne&s;t of a Pi|geon's
Egg; I eat of them at <HI>Spttzbergen,</HI> and
found them very good, they ta&s;ted like the
Lapwings Eggs; the Yolk was red, and the
White blewi&s;h; they are very &s;harp-pointed at
one end. She defends her Ne&s;t and Eggs, and
flies directly at a Man, biting and crying. It is
the &s;ame with her as what we &s;ay of the Lap|wing;
&s;he endeavours to defend all the Mea|dow,
and yet cannot defend her own Ne&s;t.</P>
<P>I brought about thirty of their Eggs with me
to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but they were rotten and &s;tunk. It
is a kind of a Hawk, and throws her&s;elf into the
Water, as othe Mews do.</P>
<P>I am of an opinion, that &s;he feeds on thee &s;mall
grey Worms, and perhaps on Shrimps and
Prawns, for I found no other Food they could
get.</P>
<P>I &s;hot but one &s;ingle Bird of them flying,
whitch I did not eat of, becau&s;e the large &s;hot
had torn it very much.</P>
<P>This Bird is quite grey in our Countries,
which differs much from that of <HI>Spizbergen,</HI>
who&s;e Feathers are much finer. That here deli|neated,
was &s;hot, by the <HI>Birds Song</HI> in <HI>Spitzber|gen,</HI>

<HEAD>XI. Of the Mallemucke.</HEAD>
<P>This Bird hath a remarkable Bill, which is
&s;everally divided: The uppermo&s;t Bill hath
next to the Head oblong and &s;mall No&s;trils;
underneath them groweth out as it was a new
Bill, that ri&s;es up, is crooked and very &s;harp|pointed.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="192">
The under part of the Bill con&s;i&s;ts partly of
four pieces, two whereof meet in a point to|gether
downwars, the other two gape upwards;
the two undermo&s;t that meet in a point, meet
exactly with the point of the upper Bill. The
hinder Claw of the Feet of this Bird is very
&s;mall, of a grey colour, and &s;o are the other
Claws and the Skin between them. The Tail
is &s;omewaht broad, the Wings are longi&s;h after
the manner of the <HI>Kirmew.</HI> They are not al|ways
of the &s;ame colour; &s;ome are quite grey,
which we take to be the olde&s;t, others are grey,
on their Back and Wings, but their Head and
Belly are white, which are the young ones:
This is generally thought, but I am of opinion,
that this difference of colour proceeds rather
form a difference in kind than from a difference
in age; for the grey ones I only &s;aw about
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but they grey and white ones, al|though
I have &s;een &s;ome few of them at <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
yet we &s;aw abundance more about the
<HI>North Cape,</HI> and Al&s;o about <HI>Hitland</HI> and <HI>England.</HI>
He flies like a great Mew, hovers near the
Water with a very &s;mall motion of his Wings.</P>
<P>They do not avoid a Strorm as our Mews do,
but they take good and bad together, as it hap|pens;
ours bend them&s;elves like an Ear of
Corn with the Wind, which the Mallemucks
do not: They do not much care for diving,
but when they wa&s;h them&s;elves they &s;it upon
the Water, and put their Wings a-cro&s;s one over
the other: They fly &s;ingly; when they go to
fly up thye wabble a great way before they can
rai&s;e them&s;elves upon the Wind, but the Lumbs
and Parrets that have but &s;mall Wings do it
more. When they ran upon the Deck of the
Ship, They could not fly up before they came
<PB N="95" REF="192">
to a place where a &s;tep went down, or from
&s;ome advantageous ri&s;e. They flock in great
numbers when we catch Whales, and light
down upon the live Whales, bite them in their
Backs, and pick out great pieces of his fat, even
when he is yet alive, and when we cut up the
dead Whales, there came &s;o many of them
about us, that we could not imagine from
whence they could all come, &s;o that we were
forced to kill them with Sticks and with broad
Nets in Frames, &s;uch as they u&s;e in the Tenis-Court,
to be rid of them: They are &s;o bold,
that they would not fly away, although they
&s;aw us caome upon them, but &s;uffered them|&s;elves
to be killed in great numbers, which we
hung upon the Tackle of our Ship.</P>
<P>But after they began to be more &s;hy of us,
and would not &s;tay &s;o long. They flock in &s;o
great numbers after the Whales, that many of
them are di&s;covered by them; wherefore I fan|cy,
that he flings up &s;ome fat when he blows
the Water out, which the Mallemucks eat. But
a great many more, when the Whale is woun|ded,
follow the bloody track left in ther Water,
for then they are numberle&s;s. They al&s;o often
di&s;cover a dead Whale, and &s;o we get them
&s;ometimes without any great trouble.</P>
<P>His Name is given him, becau&s;e he is &s;o &s;illy
or mad (which the Dutch call <HI>Mall</HI>) to &s;uffer
him&s;elf to be &s;o ea&s;ily killed, whereunto is put
the word <HI>Mucke,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Gnatt, be|cau&s;e
they are as numerous as Gantts; &s;o that
the Name <HI>Mallemucke</HI> &s;ignifieth as much as &s;illy
Gnatts, or mad Gantts.</P>
<P>They eat &s;o much of the fat of the Whales,
till they &s;pew it up again, and tumble them
&s;elves over and over in the water until they vo|mit
<PB N="90" REF="193">
up the Train-oyl, and then they begin to
eat afre&s;h, until they grow weary of eating:
They bite one another, and fight together,
which is very good &s;port, about a piece of Fat,
fiercely, although there is enough for them all,
and to &s;pare.</P>
<P>When they are full they re&s;t upon the Ice or
Water. I really believe it is the mo&s;t devou|ring
Bird of all, for he eats till he can &s;tand no
longer, but falls down. He bites very hard,
but the Burgermei&s;ter bites yet harder, to
whom he &s;ubmits him&s;elf, and lies down before
him to be bit by the Burgermei&s;ter, which he
does very &s;everely, yet the Mallemucke feels
little or nothing of it, his Feathers are &s;o thick;
which I conclude, becau&s;e he is not ea&s;ily &s;hot,
but will endure a great blow; nor is it ea&s;ie
to kill him with a Stick at one blow. When
they &s;teer them&s;elves in the Water with their
Legs, they have countinually an eye upon their
Prey, yet they mind both the Man and their
Prey; but if you have a long Stick, they can|not
get up &s;o &s;oon or &s;wift but you may have
a blow at them. He is the fir&s;t and commone&s;t
Bird of all you &s;ee in <HI>Greenland;</HI> they cry all
togehter, and it &s;ounds afar off as if they were
Frogs. He walks but ill upon the Land and
Ice, like a Child that ju&s;t learns to go, but
he under&s;tands better to fly; you &s;ee him
always near unto the &s;urface of the Water, for
he is very light. Of all the Birds of Prey, I
believe, he hath the lea&s;t Meat on him. He
builds his Ne&s;t high on the Mountains, yet not
&s;o very high as the Bungermei&s;ter, yet it was
too high for me, I could not come at them.
His Brea&s;t and Legs only are to be eaten, they
are tough, and ta&s;te &s;trong of Train oyl; when
<PB N="97" REF="193">
you will eat them you mu&s;t hang them up by
the Legs, that the Fat of the Whales, or the
Train-oyl, may run out of them, for two or
three day, and that the Wind may blow thro'
them and the Fro&s;t pierce then al&s;o; them
you lay them into fre&s;h Water, that the rank|ne&s;s
may be drawn out, afterwards boil and
fry them in Butter. They are every where
&s;een in the North Sea, as I have &s;aid before,

&s;ame &s;hape with white and black Feathers; he
hovers in the Air, and moveth his Wings but
very little; when he cometh to the Ice he
turns back again. It is a kind of a Hawk, and
I have rea&s;on to believe that he hath a very
&s;harp &s;ight, for he &s;hoots down from a great
height into the Water. They &s;ay, that the
Brains of this Bird are in great e&s;teem, but for
what I could never learn.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="194">
He is al&s;o &s;een in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sea, and every

times, and abide at this place as long as the
Sun &s;hines; afterwards, when the Cold begins
to encrea&s;e, and the Nights lengthen, every
one of them returns to its own place again.
When they are going from thence they gather
all together, and when they are all met they
<HI>fly away,</HI> every kind by them&s;elves, which
hath been very often ob&s;erved: Whence I con|clude
they cannot live in this intolerable cold

<P>I have &s;till two more Bea&s;ts to de&s;cribe, that
live as well in the Water as on the Land and
Ice, and they have al&s;o on their Feet five Claws
like Fingers, that are joyned together with a
thick Skin, like unto the Feet of a Goo&s;e: The

Dog's Head, with cropt Ears: Their Heads
are not all alike, &s;or &s;ome are rounder, and
others longer or leaner: he hath a Beard about
his Mouth, and Hair on the No&s;e and the Eye|lids,
yet &s;eldom above four: the Eyes are very
large, hollow, and very clear: their Skin is
grown over with &s;hort Hair: they are of &s;eve|ral
colours, &s;potted like Tygers, &s;ome are black
with white &s;pots, &s;ome yellow, &s;ome grey, and
others red: their Teeth are &s;harp like a Dogs,
wherewith he can bite off a Stick as thick as
ones Arm: On their Toes they have black,
<PB N="104" REF="197">
long, and &s;harp Nails or Claws; their Tail is
&s;hort; they bark like hoar&s;e Dogs; their little
or young ones mew like Cats; they go lame
behind; they can climb upon the high Ice,
whereon I &s;aw them &s;leep, chiefly when the
Sun &s;hined, wherein they take great plea&s;ure,
but when it is &s;tormy weather they mu&s;t march
off and leave it, for the Waves of the Sea beat
with great violence again&s;t it, as if it were
again&s;t Rocks, as I have mentioned already in
the Chapter of Ice.</P>
<P>We &s;aw mo&s;t of them upon the Ice about
the We&s;t &s;ide near to the &s;hoar, where there
was an incredible number of them, that if the
Ma&s;ter of a Ship &s;hould not catch Whales
enough, they might lade their Ship with <HI>Seales</HI>
only; and we have Examples that little Ships
have taken their Lading only of them, but it is
very trouble&s;ome to flea them: Nor are they
all alike fat at the time when we arrive
there.</P>
<P>By <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> we &s;ee but a few of them, but
in&s;tead of them there is plenty of Sea-hor&s;es.
Where many <HI>Seales</HI> are &s;een, that is not a good
place to catch Whales in. It &s;eemeth as if they
leave but very little for the Whale to live up|on,
becau&s;e there is &s;o great a number of them.
They feed upon &s;mall Fi&s;hes, as far as I could
under&s;tand; we cut open &s;everal of them, and
found nothing in their Stomachs but great and
long whiti&s;h Worms of the thickne&s;s of ones

<HI>Spitzbergen</HI> after this manner: They heat Saw|du&s;t,
and tread the&s;e Skins in it, which &s;ucks
up the Fat, and the Skins become to be dry,
after the &s;ame manner as we u&s;e to take out
&s;pots of Fat out of &s;ine Linnen or other Clothes,
when we hold it again&s;t the Sun: They are of
the &s;ame bigne&s;s as ours, great and &s;mall:
Their Hair is long, and as &s;oft as Wool: their
No&s;e and Mouth are black before, and their
Talons al&s;o black: The fat of their Feet mel|ted
out, is u&s;ed for pain of the Limbs; it is al|&s;o
given to Women in travail, to bring away
the Child; it cau&s;es al&s;o a plentiful Sweat.
The &s;aid Fat is very &s;pongy, and feels very
&s;oft; it is be&s;t to try it up there pre&s;ently: I
&s;trove to keep it until I &s;hould come home, but
it grew foul, rancid, and &s;tinking. I believe
it would be very good to try it up with Orris|root,
for then it would remain the longer good
and &s;mell well.</P>
<P>The other is like Suet when it is tryed up, it
becometh thin like Train-oyl, or the fat
of Whales: But this is not to be compared to
the other for Vertue and Goodne&s;s, it is only
u&s;ed in Lamps, where it does not &s;tink &s;o
much as the Train-oyl: The Skippers met it
out there, and bring it home with them to &s;ell
it for Train-oyl. Their Fle&s;h is whiti&s;h and
fat, like that of a Sheep, but I did not care to
try how it ta&s;ted, for I was afraid that my
Hair would turn grey before its time, for the
Seamen are of opinion, that if they eat of it,
it makes their Hair grey. They &s;uckle their.
Young with their Milk, which is very white
and fat, as I ob&s;erved, when we cut up an old
&s;uckling She one. They &s;ay our Bears have a
very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ft Head, but I round the contary in

the&s;e at <HI>Spitzbergen&punc;</HI> for we &s;truck them with
large and thick Cudgels, upon their Heads,
with &s;uch blows that would have knock'd down
a Bullock, and yet they did not matter it at all.
When we had a mind to kill them, we were
forced to run them through with our Laun|ces.</P>
<P>They &s;wim from one &s;heet of Ice to the
other, they al&s;o dive under Water, when they
were at one &s;ide of our Long-boat, they did
dive, and came up again on the other. They
al&s;o run upon the Land. I did not hear them
roar &s;o as ours do, but they only bark.</P>
<P>We could not di&s;cern the young ones from
the old ones, but only by the two furthermo&s;t
long Teeth, which in the young were hollow
within, but tho&s;e of the old ones were clo&s;e and
&s;olid. If you burn their Teeth, and powder
them, and give them inwardly, it di&s;per&s;eth
coagulated Blood. The young ones keep con|&s;tantly
clo&s;e to the old ones; we ob&s;erved that
two young ones and an old one would not
leave one another, for if one ran away, it turn'd
back again immediately as &s;oon as it did hear
the others, as if it would come to help
them. The old one run to the young one, and
the young one to the old one, and rather than
they would leave one another, they would &s;uffer
them&s;elves to be all killed.</P>
<P>They feed upon the Carca&s;&s;es of Whales, and
near them we killed the mo&s;t: They al&s;o eat
Men alive when they have an opportunity to
ma&s;ter them: They remove or roll away the
Stones of the burying places, open the Coffins,
and eat the dead Men, which many have &s;een,
and we can al&s;o conclude it from hence, be|cau&s;e
we find the dead Mens Bones lye by the
<PB N="107" REF="198">
re&s;t are the &s;ame, for when we thought that
they lay dead in our Long-boats, they &s;napt
about them, &s;o that we were forced to kill
them.</P>
<P>For Sports &s;ake I went once along with
them upon the Ice, and run one through the
Body with my Sword &s;everal times, which he
did not matter at all; I fell into the Snow up
to my Knees, and he barked at me, and offe|red
to bite me, which I avoided, and when I
got up again I ran after him, and gave him &s;e|veral
wounds more, which he was not concer|ned
at, but ran &s;wifter than I could, and flung
him&s;elf off from the Ice into the Sea, and went
down to the bottom. Tab. <HI>P,</HI> &s;ee <HI>a.</HI></P>

<HEAD>V. Of the Sea-hor&s;e, called by &s;ome the Mor&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Sea-hor&s;e</HI> is not unlike unto the <HI>Seale</HI> in
the &s;hape of the Body, only is much bigger
than the other: He is as big as an Ox: Their
Legs are al&s;o like tho&s;e of the <HI>Seale,</HI> for they
have five Claws as well on the fore as the hin|der
Feet, but they have only &s;hort Nails: Their
Head is thicker, and rounder, and al&s;o much
&s;tronger: Their Skin is an inch thick, chiefly
about the Neck, covered with &s;hort Mou&s;e-coloured
Hair, &s;ome reddi&s;h, &s;ome grey, &s;ome
have but little Hair, and are mangy, and full
of Scarrs that are bitten, and look as if they
were flea'd; every where about their Joints
their Skin is full of Lines, as the in&s;ide of a
Man's Hand: They have two great and long
Teeth in their upper Jaw-bone, that hang
down below their under Lips, that are about
a foot and two foot long, &s;ometimes they are
longer: The young ones have no great Teeth
<PB N="108" REF="199">
at all, but they grow in time as they grow ol|der.
All the Sea-hor&s;es have two firm long
Teeth; yet I have &s;een old ones that had but
one; it may be that &s;ometimes they loo&s;e them
when they fight, or otherwi&s;e they may fall
out of them&s;elves, for I ob&s;erved that &s;ome of
them had foul, hollow, rotten Teeth. The&s;e
two long Teeth are e&s;teemed beyond Ivory,
becau&s;e they are &s;o very white, and are dearer;
they are clo&s;e and firm within, and heavy, but
the Root thereof is hollow. Of their Teeth
are made Knife-hafts, Boxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Jut|landers</HI>
make Buttons for their Clothes of the
other Teeth. Their Mouth is very broad be|fore,
like a Bullocks, whereon grow above and
underneath &s;everal Bri&s;tles that are hollow
within, and of the bigne&s;s of a Straw: Of
the&s;e Bri&s;tles the Seamen make Rings, which
they wear on their Fingers for the Cramp.
Above the uppermo&s;t Beard they have two
&s;emicircular No&s;trils, whereout he blows the
Water, like the Whale, yet with a le&s;s noi&s;e.
Their Eyes are at a good di&s;tance from the
No&s;e; they have Eyelids as other fourfooted
Bea&s;ts have; his Eyes are naturally as red as
Blood when he doth not turn them, and I
could &s;ee no difference when they were mo|ved,
for they always turn'd their Eyes when
they did look upon me, and then they look
much uglier, though they are never hand&s;om.
Their Ears are &s;omewhat higher than the Eyes,
but very near to them, which are like tho&s;e of
the <HI>Seales.</HI> Their Tongue is at lea&s;t as big as a
Neat's, when it is but newly boiled it may be
eaten, but if it is laid by for two or three days,
it becomes rank, like Train-oyl. Their Neck
is very thick, wherefore he does not readily
<PB N="105" REF="199">
this fright of theirs we &s;trike them with Half-pikes,
or long Poles upon their No&s;es, and
knock them down half dead, but for all that,
they recover them&s;elves, and ri&s;e again: Some
of them &s;tand upon their defence, bite at, and
run after the Men, and they run as fa&s;t as a
Man, and their lame way of going doth not
hinder them at all, for they &s;hove them&s;elves
along ju&s;t like an Eel: Some run from the Ice
to the Water, and leave a yellow Dung behind
them, which they &s;quirt out at their Hunters,
as the Hern does: They &s;tink naturally abomi|nably.
Others &s;tand in the Water with half
their Belly, and look about them to &s;ee what
is done upon the Ice: When they are going to
dive under the Water, they hold up their No|&s;es,
and make a long Neck: When they jump
from the Ice under Water, and al&s;o when they
make a dance of <HI>Seales,</HI> as they call it, about
the Ships, they con&s;tantly dive with their
Heads under water. They have their young
ones by them, one whereof we took away with
us to the Ship alive, but it would not eat any
thing, but did mew ju&s;t like a Cat, and if we
touch'd him he would &s;nap at us, &s;o we killed
him. The bigge&s;t of them that I have &s;een
were from five to eight foot long, out of which
we cut &s;o much fat, that we filled half a Bar|rel
with it. He that I have drawn here was
eight foot long. Their Fat is about three or
four Fingers thick, it covers the Fle&s;h ju&s;t under
the Skin, and we do flea it off as a Skin: This
Fat yields the be&s;t Train-oyl; the Fle&s;h is quite
black. They have abundance of Blood, as if
they were only filled up with it. They have
great Livers, Lungs, and Hearts, which we eat
after we have drawn out the rankne&s;s with
<PB N="106" REF="200">
Water, we boil them, but this Di&s;n is very
loath&s;om, &s;o that I could not eat it, it ta&s;ted &s;o
of Train-oyl. He hath abundance of Guts,
which are very &s;mall: I found no Fat within
them; their parts of generation is a hard Bone,
like unto that of a Dog, about a &s;pan long, co|vered
with Sinews; &s;ome were hardly &s;o long
as your little finger, and yet they were not
young ones neither. The Cry&s;tal of their Eye
is not of the &s;ame colour always, for &s;ome were
like a Cry&s;tal, others white, others yellowi&s;h,
others reddi&s;h; they are bigger than a Pea; if
one will keep them he mu&s;t let them dry gent|ly,
or one may wrap them in Linnen Rags,
and &s;o lay them in a moi&s;t place, for el&s;e they
fly or crack to pieces. I am informed, that
when they couple they are very fierce, &s;o that
a Man dares not come near them upon the Ice,
then they bring their Long boats near the Ice,
and &s;o kill them out of the Boats. They do
not quickly dye when the Blood is almo&s;t all
run out, after they have been mortally woun|ded
and flea'd, they &s;till live, and it looks ill to
&s;ee them tumble them&s;elves about in their own
Blood. We had an Example of that in him
that was eight foot long, for when he was flea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d,
and mo&s;t of the Fat cut off, notwith&s;tanding
all the blows he had had upon his Head and
No&s;e, he would &s;till &s;nap at us, and bite about
him, and took hold of a &s;hort Pike with his
Teeth after &s;uch a rate, as if nothing ailed him.
Then we run a &s;hort Pike through his very
Heart and Liver, and there ran out as much
Blood as if it had been a Bullock. The
Ma&s;ters of the Ships will not &s;uffer the&s;e na&s;ty
doings in their Ships, for it fouls them mighti|ly.
Not only this was &s;o vivacious, but all the
<PB N="109" REF="200">
turn his Head about, and this is the rea&s;on why
he turneth his Eyes generally. Their Tails are
&s;hort, like tho&s;e of the <HI>Seale.</HI></P>
<P>From their Fle&s;h we cut no Fat, it is all
mixed together like unto Hogs-fle&s;h, to which
it is the like&s;t: Their Heart and Liver we did
eat; they ta&s;te well enough, chiefly where we
have no great variety of Di&s;hes. Their Yards
are of a hard Bone, about two foot long, thick
at the bottom, and le&s;s before, &s;omewhat bent
in the middle, at the &s;ide towards their Belly it
is flat, but it is round without, and it is every
where covered over with Sinews. They
turn also <HI>Knife hafts</HI> and other things out of this
Bone. What their Food is I cannot certainly
tell, they may perhaps eat both <HI>Herbs</HI> and
<HI>Fish;</HI> that they eat <HI>Herbs,</HI> I conclude from
hence, that their Dung looks like Hor&s;e-dung:
That they eat <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> I judge, becau&s;e when we
cut the Fat off a Whale one of them did often
take the Skin with him under Water, he did al|&s;o
fling it up, and catch it again. The <HI>Burger|mei&s;ter</HI>
doth eat his Dung, as is &s;aid before when
I writ of the Birds. The <HI>Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hor&s;es</HI> keep gene|rally
about <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for among&s;t the Ice-hills
I &s;aw none. They lay upon the Ice, as I
have already mentioned in the Fir&s;t Part, by
the 12th of <HI>July</HI> very na&s;tily, as the <HI>Seales</HI> in
great numbers, and roar mo&s;t terribly. They
dive with their Head under the Water before,
like the <HI>Seales.</HI> They &s;leep and &s;nore, not on|ly
upon the Ice, but al&s;o in the Water, &s;o that
we take them &s;everal times for dead ones.</P>
<P>They are very &s;tout and unda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nted Crea|tures,
they &s;tand by one another as long as
they have Life, and if any of them be wounded
they make to the Long-boat, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="110" REF="201">
that the Men &s;trike, and cut, and pu&s;h at them&punc;
&s;ome will dive under the Water near unto the
Long-boats, and cut holes in them with their
great Teeth under Water; and others without
any fear at all make to the Boat, and &s;tand up
with half their Body out of the Water, and
endeavour to get into the Boat.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a Battel a Sea-hor&s;e did once &s;trike
with his <HI>Teeth</HI> or <HI>Tu&s;hes</HI> into the Boat, and took
hold of our Harponier with his long Tooth,
between his Shirt and the Wa&s;tband of his
Breeches, &s;o that the Wa&s;tband broke, other|wi&s;e
he had pulled him under Water.</P>
<P>When they roar, if they are imitated, they
&s;trive which &s;hall get underneath the Water,
and fall a fighting and biting one another till
they fetch Blood: Others &s;trive to &s;et at liberty
the Sea-hor&s;es taken by the Men, &s;triving before
each other to get to the Boat, biting and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h|ing
with their Teeth, and roaring terribly:
They never give over &s;o long as one of them
is alive, and if you are forced to fly, becau&s;e
of their un&s;peakable number, they will follow
the Boat till you lo&s;e them out of &s;ight, for
they cannot follow far, their great number hin|dring
one another. This we found by <HI>Weiheg at</HI>
by <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> where they got together in
great numbers, and made our Boat take in
Water, &s;o that we were forced to flee, yet they
followed us as long as we could &s;ee them, on
the 12th day of <HI>July.</HI> We take them only for
their Teeth: You &s;hall &s;ee almo&s;t a hundred
of them before you find one that hath good
Teeth, for &s;ome of them are but &s;mall, others
have but one, and others none at all.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="201">
I &s;aw one in the <HI>English Haven</HI> lying on a
&s;heet of Ice, at fir&s;t we took him to be a <HI>Seale,</HI>
but we found it was an old, bald, and mangy
<HI>Sea-hor&s;e.</HI> We gave him &s;ome blows, which
he took, and dived under Water. When they
&s;ee them lye upon the Ice, or hear them roar,
they row with their Boats to them, where they
lye in great numbers, but I believe one of them
keeps watch, for I have &s;everal times ob&s;erved
that one of them did &s;trike him that was next
to him with his Tooth, and &s;o it went on:
When they awake they ri&s;e up and &s;tand upon
their fore-foot, look terribly, and roar, and
&s;trike with their long Teeth into the Ice for
madne&s;s, and &s;o draw them&s;elves along by the
help thereof, when they run apace, or climb
upon the Ice, as the <HI>Seales</HI> do. Their greate&s;t
&s;trength lyeth in their Head, and their Skin is
thicke&s;t about the Neck, it is thicker than that
of an Elk, and it is also a great deal firmer;
wherefore if they were dre&s;&s;ed like an Elk's
Skin, they would &s;erve in&s;tead of the be&s;t Buff|coat.
When great multitudes of them lye up|on
a &s;heet of Ice, and they do awake and fling
them&s;elves into the Sea, you mu&s;t keep off your
Boat at a di&s;tance from the Ice, until the grea|ter
part of them are got off, for el&s;e they would
jump into the Boat to you, and over&s;et it,
whereof many In&s;tances have been; then the
Harponier runs after them on the Ice, or he
darts his Harpon out of the Boat at the <HI>Sea|hor&s;e,</HI>
who runs on a little until he is tired, then
the Men draw on the Rope or Line again, and
fetch him to the Boat, where he begins to re&s;i&s;t
to his utmo&s;t, biting and jumping out of the
Water, and the Harponier runs his Launce in|to
him till he is killed. When they dart the
<PB N="112" REF="202">
Harpoon at them, they always take the oppor|tunity
to do it when he is precipitating him&s;elf
from the Ice, or when he diveth with his Head
under Water, for then his Skin is &s;mooth and
extended, and therefore the Harpoon &s;triketh
through the Skin on his Back the better; but
when he lyeth and &s;leepeth his Skin is loo&s;e and
wrinkled, &s;o that the Harpoon does not pierce
the Skin, but falls off. The Harpoon for a
<HI>Sea-hor&s;e</HI> and the Launce al&s;o are &s;hort, of the
length of one &s;pan, or one and a half, and an
inch thick, and the wooden Staff thereof is
about &s;ix foot long; the Harpoon for a Whale
is much took weak to pierce his thick Skin
withal, yet both of them are very well tem|per'd,
and of good tough Iron, and not much
hardened. When the <HI>Sea-hor&s;e</HI> is killed, they
take his Head only and leave the re&s;t, this they
carry on board, where they cut out the Teeth;
the two great ones belong to the Owners or
Merchants of the Ship, but the &s;mall Teeth are
not e&s;teem'd. I cannot but mention that we
went by a Field of Ice, where &s;o many <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI>
lay that the weight of them made the
Ice even with the Water, but when they were
jumped off into the Sea, we could hardly &s;tep
out of our Boat upon it, &s;o high was it ri&s;en
out of the Water. It was related to me, by
them that u&s;ed this <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade every Year,
as a certain Truth, that once when they had
no good fortune to catch Whales, they rowed
with their Boats to the <HI>Mufs I&s;land,</HI> which was
full of <HI>Sea-hor&s;es,</HI> they ventur'd upon them
couragiou&s;ly with cutting, &s;triking, pu&s;hing,

<HEAD>IV. Of the Lou&s;e of the Whale.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Whale's Lou&s;e</HI> hath no re&s;emblance at all
to our Lice, except in the Head, and therefore
it belongs rather to the Cru&s;taceous Animals.
Their Scales are as hard as tho&s;e of the Prawns.
They have a Head like a Lou&s;e, with 4 Horns;
the two &s;hort Horns that &s;tand out before have
two knobs, like Kettledrum-&s;ticks; the two other
bended Horns are &s;harp before. Its Head hath
almo&s;t th &s;hape of an Acorn, is cut very deep
behind. It hath two Eyes, and but one No|&s;tril.
The Neck is not made of &s;tiff Scales, but
its Skin is like that between two Scales or
Plates of a Lob&s;ter. It hath &s;ix Plates on the
Back; the foremo&s;t of them is &s;haped like a
Weaver's Shutle. The Tail might be compa|red
unto a Shield, but it is very &s;hort. On the
foremo&s;t Plate it hath Feet shaped like a Sythe;
they are round before, and bent, like the fir&s;t
Quarter of the Moon; but on the in&s;ide they
are toothed like a Saw, and at the end thereof
there is a &s;harp point: On each &s;ide of the &s;e|cond
and third Plait grow out four <HI>Legs</HI> that
are his Oars; they have a &s;hort Joint below,
wherein the&s;e Oars are moved; the&s;e they lay
in a cro&s;s one over the other, upon their Back,
when they feed upon the Whale; or they put
them upwards together, as the Vaulters do when
they jump over Swords: The &s;ix hindmo&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="206">
Legs are like tho&s;e of a <HI>Crawfi&s;h;</HI> they have
three Joints on each Leg, the foremo&s;t where|of

or on their ends they are very &s;harp pointed,
&s;o that they can take firm hold as well of the
Skin of Men as of that of the Whale, &s;o that
you mu&s;t cut them in pieces before you can
pull them from the Skin. He that will have
them alive, mu&s;t cut the Skin of the Whale out
with them. They &s;it on certain places of the
Whale's Body (as between his Finns, on his <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|denda,</HI>

<P>I have &s;een but two &s;orts of the&s;e in my

Above, upon the plain of its Body it
hath five double rows of &s;harp knobs or grains;
between each of the&s;e double rows is a Tingle
row of the &s;ome knobs, &s;o that in all there is
15 rows of knobs on the whole plain. The&s;e
15 rows together make a Star of five outward
bended points.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="207">
As for the re&s;t, this Plain looketh like the
Back of a Spider, but if he is turned he looketh
neatly, and in this po&s;ture is &s;een in the middle
a five-corner'd plain Star, which I take to be
its Mouth, which he can open and draw toge|ther
like a Pur&s;e. Round about this Star are
&s;mall black Spots, in rows, of the &s;hape of a Star.
Further forwards, about the middle Star or his
Mouth a broader one is, like unto the Flower
of the Crowsfoot. From the middle Star pro|ceed
five Legs or Arms, which have no knobs
where they begin, but begin fir&s;t to have &s;ome
behind the Flower like &s;haped Star, on both
&s;ides to the end. The knobs between the Legs
are &s;oft to the touch, like the Skin of an Egg.
Their Legs are &s;caley, about three fingers
breadth long, broader at their beginning, where
they have knobs, and afterwards by degrees
they grow narrower. Between the Scales on
both &s;ides the Knobs come out commonly
three or four together, and look like Warts.
When he &s;wims in the Water he &s;preads out
the&s;e Knobs on each &s;ide, ju&s;t as a Bird doth his
Feathers when it is going to fly. See Tab. <HI>P&punc;</HI>

where they meet together; that is to &s;ay, of the
&s;hape of a Dove-tail: It feeleth rough: The
lower part of the Body is very neat; in the
middle thereof is a Star with &s;ix points, which
I take to be his Mouth: About the Mouth he
is &s;oft, to the place where his Legs begin: Be|tween
the beginning of his Legs he had &s;oft
Cavities. His Legs are where they begin thick,
and have in the middle a longi&s;h hollow or
gutter, which feeleth &s;oft; on the Brim they
are adorned with Scales that lye one over the
other, no otherwi&s;e than if they were a row of
Coral, but underneath the Scales are twi&s;ted,
and have in the middle forwards &s;mall black
Strokes, but the Scales lye over one another
like unto the Plaits of the <HI>Crawfi&s;h:</HI> Be&s;ides,
where the Legs come out of the Body, they
&s;pread them&s;elves double into Twigs, and are,
as is &s;aid before, hollow in the middle, until
the place where they divide them&s;elves into &s;e|veral
Branches, and &s;o grow &s;lenderer by de|grees.
The undermo&s;t &s;mall Branches are &s;ca|ley
all round, but not twi&s;ted like Ropes;
they are &s;harp pointed on their ends like unto
the Feet of a Spider, wherefore the Seamen call
them Sea-&s;piders. When they &s;wim in the
Water they hold their Legs together, and &s;o
they row along. I had one of this &s;ort that
was a &s;pan long, from the extremity of one
Foot to the other; but this I have delineated
is le&s;s. The bigge&s;t are the hand&s;omo&s;t for

the Water, and when they are a dying they
bend their Legs towards the Mouth. The

<P>BEfore I come to treat of the Whale, I think

<HI>Macarel.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of the Macarel.</HEAD>
<P>This Fi&s;h is like unto a <HI>Herring</HI> in his &s;hape,
but hath on his Back a large Finn, and &s;ome|what
below it a very &s;mall one. Then lower
there is another greater and broader one, but
<PB N="121" REF="208">
not &s;o high as the uppermo&s;t: Underneath this
are five &s;mall ones, that are all of the &s;ame big|ne&s;s,
and at an equal di&s;tance one from ano|ther.
Very near to the Tail there is another
le&s;s one; &s;o that on the whole Back there is
two great ones, and &s;even little ones. Near
unto the Gills is a Finn on each &s;ide: under|neath
the Belly there are again on each &s;ide
one almo&s;t of the &s;ame bigne&s;s of that that is
near to the Gills. Underneath towards the
Tail is one of the &s;ame bigne&s;s of the third on
the Back. Behind this there are again five of
an equal bigne&s;s; and below that &s;till a le&s;s one;
&s;o that tho&s;e of the lower part of the Back are
equal to tho&s;e of the lower part of the Belly.
Their Head is like unto that of a <HI>Herring.</HI> He hath
a great many &s;mall holes on the Cover of his
Gills, and al&s;o underneath the Eyes. They
have a great variety of colours, that look more
glorious when they are alive than when they
are dead, for when they are a dying the colours
fade and grow pale. From his Back towards
the Side he hath black Stroaks. The upper|mo&s;t
part of his Back is blew till to the mid|le,
and the other half underneath it is green,
and as if &s;ome blew did &s;hine through it. Un|derneath
his Belly he is as white as Silver, and
his Finns are white every where. All the co|lours
of this Fi&s;h &s;hine like to a Silver or Gol|den
Ground, done over with thin, tran&s;parent
or illuminating colours. Their Eyes are black.
It is the beautifule&s;t Fi&s;h of all that ever I &s;aw.
This that I de&s;cribe here was catched in the
North Sea; afterwards, on the 27th day of
<HI>June,</HI> in the Year 1673. we did catch &s;ome
Macarels behind <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the I&s;land of
<HI>St. Kilda,</HI> which were half blind; it is occa&s;io|ned
<PB N="122" REF="209">
by a black Skin that groweth over their
Eyes in the Winter, and cometh off again in
the beginning of the Summer. We do not &s;ee
them in the Winter, for they run towards the
North: In the Summer we &s;ee them in the
North Sea, and I have &s;een them al&s;o in <HI>Spain.</HI>
We caught them after the following manner;
we fa&s;tened a Bullet that weighed about two
or three pounds to a Line, about a Fathom di|&s;tance
from the end, whereon we had fa&s;tened
a Hook; this Hook we baited with a piece of
a red Cloth, and &s;o we flung it into the Sea,
and towed it behind our Ship, then when the
<HI>Macarel</HI> doth <HI>&s;wiftly &s;hoot</HI> at it, he bites
upon the Hook, and &s;o is hung, which you
pre&s;ently, perceive by its pulling, as you do
when you catch any other Fi&s;h, notwith&s;tand|ing
that the Rope of its own accord doth pull
or draw very hard, by rea&s;on of the Sea, &s;o
that if you &s;hould rowl it about your Hand, it
would benumb your Hand in a little time to
that degree, that you would not be &s;en&s;ible, if
one &s;hould cut it; wherefore they tye their
Ropes to the carved Work on the Stern of the
Ship, &s;o that &s;ometimes many of them are tyed
to the Ship by one another, when the Ship
&s;ails apace, but this doth hinder the Ship very
much in its &s;ailing, and I dare &s;ay two &s;uch
Ropes draw as much as a Man's Strength.
They catch them al&s;o with <HI>Herring,</HI> with a piece
whereof they bait the Hook, at which they
bite &s;ooner than at a red piece of Rag of Cloth.
They eat be&s;t if you boil, or broil, or roa&s;t
them fre&s;h as they are caught, or dry them:
They are hard to be dige&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. Of the Hay.</HEAD>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of them; they have
two Finns on their Backs, the highe&s;t whereof
is like to the uppermo&s;t of the <HI>Butskopf,</HI> but the
lowermo&s;t is of an equal breadth at the top and
bottom, but it is hollowed out like a Sickle:
He hath &s;ix Finns underneath his Belly, where|of
the foremo&s;t two are the longe&s;t, and &s;haped
like a Tongue, but the two middlemo&s;t are
&s;omewhat broader than tho&s;e towards the Tail,
and of the &s;ame &s;hape; the two la&s;t underneath
by the Tail are of an equal breadth from top to
bottom, &s;omething &s;horter than the middle
ones. The Tail is of a peculiar &s;hape, like un|to
one half part of that of the <HI>Sword-fi&s;h,</HI> but it
is &s;plit below; and the other part is like a Leaf
of a Lilly. He hath a long No&s;e. The whole
Fi&s;h is long, round, and thin, and he is thicke&s;t
towards the Head: his Mouth is &s;hap'd as that
of the <HI>Sword-fi&s;h;</HI> it is full of &s;harp Teeth, three
upper and three under rows, one by the other:
his Eyes &s;tand &s;omething more out before than
behind, after the &s;ame fa&s;hion as tho&s;e of the
<HI>Sword-fi&s;h,</HI> they are oblong, and very clear: he
hath five Gills on each &s;ide, as the <HI>Sword-fi&s;h:</HI>
his Skin is hard and thick, and rough if you
touch it or &s;trike it upwards; it is of a greyi&s;h
<PB N="129" REF="212">
colour; they are from one fathom long to
three: It is a very devouring Fi&s;h, and bites
great pieces form the <HI>Whale,</HI> as if they had been
dug out with Shovels. They devour of many
<HI>Whales,</HI> all the Fat underneath the Water, and
this is the rea&s;on that the Seamen &s;ay, <HI>They
have caught half a Whale that was dead.</HI> And
the Birds do help them al&s;o, and what is not ta|ken
away underneath, ferments out at the top.
They have a large Liver, whereof they make
Oyl. Out of their Backs we cut the Fle&s;h, which
we hang up for &s;ome days in the open Air,
then we boil and roa&s;t it, and this ta&s;ts very
well, when we have nothing that is better.
They do not fling away the <HI>Hays</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> but
&s;ell them: The little ones are the be&s;t. They
are very eager after Man's Fle&s;h, and eat many
a Man that goeth to &s;wim or wa&s;h in the Sea,
whereof we have many In&s;tances. They are
ea&s;ily caught after the following manner; we
take a great Hook fa&s;tned to a &s;trong Iron
Chain, baited with a piece of Fle&s;h, and let it
hang down into the Sea; the <HI>Hay</HI> as &s;oon as he
doth perceive it, &s;naps at it, and is catch'd;
but when the <HI>Hay,</HI> perceives that he is fa&s;t, he
doth u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavour to bite off the
Hook, which he cannot for the Iron.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Whale.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fi&s;h properly called the <HI>Whale,</HI> for
who&s;e &s;ake our Ships chiefly undertake
the Voyage to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> is differing from
other <HI>Whales</HI> in his Finns and Mouth, which is
without Teeth, but in&s;tead thereof long, black,
&s;omewhat broad, and horny Flakes, all jagged
like Hairs: he differs from the Finn-fi&s;h in his
Finns, for the Finn-fi&s;h hath a great Finn on
his Back, but the Whale, properly &s;o called,
hath none on his Back; and there is two Finns
behind his Eyes of a bigne&s;s proportionable to
the Whale, covered with a thick black Skin,
delicately marbled with white Strokes, or as
you &s;ee in Marble, Trees, Hou&s;es, or the like
things repre&s;ented. In the Tail of one of the
Fi&s;hes was marbled very delicately this number
1222 very even and exact, as if they had been
painted upon it on purpo&s;e. This marbling
on the Whale is like Veins in a piece of Wood,
that run &s;treight through, or el&s;e round about
the center or pith of a Tree; and &s;o go both
white and yellow &s;trokes through the thick and
the thin &s;trokes, that is like Parchment or
Vellam, and give to the Whale an incompara|ble
Beauty and Ornament. When the&s;e Finns
are cut up, you find underneath the thick Skin
Bones that look like unto a Man's Hand;
when it is opened, and the Fingers are expan|ded
or &s;pread, between the&s;e Joynts there are
&s;tiff Sinews, which flye up and rebound again
<PB REF="214">
<PB N="131" REF="214">
if you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them hard again&s;t the Ground, as
the Sinews of great Fi&s;h, as of a Sturgeon, or
of &s;ome four footed Bea&s;ts generally do. You
may cut pieces of the&s;e Sinews of the bigne&s;s
of your Head, they &s;queeze together when
thrown on the Ground, and &s;o rebound very
high, and as &s;wift as an Arrow from the String
of a long Bow. The Whale hath no other
Finns but the&s;e two wherewith he &s;teers him|&s;elf,
as a Boat is rowed with two Oars.</P>
<P>Their Tail doth not &s;tand up as the Tails of
almo&s;t any other Fi&s;h, but it doth lye horizon|tal,
as that of the <HI>Finn-fi&s;h, Butskopf, Dolphin,</HI>
and the like, and it is three, three and an half,
and four fathoms broad. The Head is the
third part of the Fi&s;h, and &s;ome have bigger
Heads; on the upper and under Lip are &s;hort
Hairs before. Their Lips are quite plain,
&s;omewhat bended like an S, and they end un|derneath
the Eyes before the two Finns:
Above the uppermo&s;t bended Lip he hath
black Streaks, &s;ome are darki&s;h brown, and they
are crooked as the Lips are. Their Lips are
&s;mooth, and quite black, round like the quarter
of a Circle; when they draw them together they
lock into one another: Within, on the upper|mo&s;t
Lip is the Whale-bone, of a brown, black,
and yellow colour, with &s;treaks of &s;everal co|lours,
as the Bones of a <HI>Finn-fi&s;h.</HI> The Whale|bones
of &s;ome Whales are blew, and light blew,
which two are reckoned to come from young
Whales. In one of my Cutts here you may &s;ee
the Whale-bone in the Tab. <HI>Q</HI> marked with <HI>a.</HI>
In the other Cutt, where his Mouth is &s;hut up,
you do not &s;ee the Whale bone. Ju&s;t before,
on the under Lip, is a cavity or hole which the
upper Lip fits exactly into, as a Knife into a
<PB N="132" REF="215">
Sheath. I do really believe, that he draws the
Water that he bloweth out through this hole,
and &s;o I have been informed al&s;o by Sea|men.</P>
<P>Within his Mouth is the Whale-bone, all
hairy as a Hor&s;e's Hair, as it is al&s;o in the <HI>Finn-fi&s;h,</HI>
and it hangs down from both &s;ides all about
his Tongue. The Whale-bone of &s;ome Whales
is &s;omewhat bended like unto a Cimeter, and
others like unto a half-Moon.</P>
<P>The &s;malle&s;t Whale-bone is before, in his
Mouth, and behind towards his Throat; and
the middlemo&s;t is the greate&s;t and longe&s;t, it
is &s;ometimes about two or three Men's length,
from whence you may ea&s;ily conjecture how
large this Fi&s;h mu&s;t be. On one &s;ide, all in a
row, there is two hundred and fifty pieces of
Whale bone, and as many al&s;o on the other
&s;ide, which maketh five hundred in all, and
there is more over and above this number, for
they let the lea&s;t Whale-bone of all remain, be|cau&s;e
they cannot well come at it to cut it out,
becau&s;e it is very narrow where the two Lips
meet together. The Whale-bone is in a flat
row one piece by the other, &s;omewhat bended
within, and towards the Lips every where like
a half-Moon.</P>
<P>The Whale-bone is broad at the top, where
it &s;ticketh fa&s;t to the upper Lip, every where
overgrown with hard and white Sinews towards
the Root, &s;o that between two pieces of Whale-bone
you may put in your hand. The&s;e white
Sinews look like boiled <HI>Sea-catts</HI> or <HI>Black-fi&s;h</HI> (in
Spani&s;h called <HI>Cattula la Mar</HI>) they are of a
plea&s;ant Smell, &s;o that we might eat of them;
they are not tough at all, but break as ea&s;ily as
Chee&s;e, but they did not ta&s;te &s;o well; when
<PB N="133" REF="215">
they putrifie or rot they &s;mell horribly, ju&s;t like
unto a foul or rotten Tooth. Where the
Whale-bone is broade&s;t, as underneath by the
Root, there groweth &s;mall Whale-bone, the
other greater, as you &s;ee &s;mall and large Trees
one among&s;t the other in a Wood. I believe
the &s;mall Whale-bone doth not grow bigger,
as one might think that &s;ome of the great pie|ces
thereof might come out, and that &s;o this
&s;mall Whale-bone might grow up again in the
room thereof, or as in Children the Hair grows
again when cut off; but it is not &s;o, for this
Whale-bone is quite another &s;ort, for it is from
one end to t'other of an equal thickne&s;s and full
of long Jacks like Hor&s;es Hair. The Whale-bone
is underneath narrow and pointed, and all
overgrown with Hair, that it may not hurt
that that is young: But without the Whale|bone
hath a Cavity, for it is turned ju&s;t like
unto a Gutter wherein the Water runs, where
it lyeth one over the other, as the Shields or
Plaits of <HI>Craw-fi&s;h,</HI> or the Pan-tiles of an Hou&s;e,
that lye one over the other, for el&s;e it might
ea&s;ily wound or hurt the under Lips. I am of
opinion that one might u&s;e Whale-bone in any
thing that we u&s;e Boards for, for they make of
Whale-bone, Boxes, Knife-hafts, Walking-&s;ticks,
and the like. I &s;hould think that out of the
Hair of the Fi&s;h might be made &s;omething, as
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do out of the wild <HI>Sempervive
Aloes,</HI> (by them called <HI>Savila</HI>) they prepare it
like Flax or Hemp, and &s;o make Packthreads
Clothes and the like Manufactures of it.</P>
<P>To cut the Whale-bones out is al&s;o a peculiar
Trade, and abundance of Iron Tools belong
thereunto. The lower part of the Whale's
Mouth is commonly white. The Tongue ly|eth
<PB N="134" REF="216">
among&s;t the Whale-bones; it is very clo&s;e
tyed to the undermo&s;t Chap or Lip; it is very
large and white, with black &s;pots at the edges:
It is a &s;oft &s;pongy Fat, which cannot ea&s;ily be
cut; it makes a great deal of work to the Cutter
(for &s;o they call the Man that doth cut the Fat
into &s;mall pieces with a large Knife, which
cannot well be done with other Knifes, be|cau&s;e
it is tough and &s;oft) wherefore they fling
the Tongue away, el&s;e they might get five, &s;ix
or &s;even Barrels of Train-oyl out of it; but, as
I &s;aid before, they fling it away, becau&s;e of its
&s;oftne&s;s; and this is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Food for
the <HI>Sword-fi&s;h.</HI> Upon his Head is the Hovel or
Bump before the Eyes and Finns: At the top
of this Bump, on each &s;ide, is a Spout-hole,
two over-again&s;t one another, which are ben|ded
on each &s;ide like an S, or as the hole that
is cut on a Violin, whereout he doth blow the
Water very fiercely, that it roars like a hollow
Wind which we hear when the Wind blow|eth
into a Cave, or again&s;t the corner of a
Board, or like an Organ-pipe. This may be
heard at a leagues di&s;tance, although you do
not &s;ee him by rea&s;on of the thick and foggy
Air. The <HI>Whale</HI> bloweth or &s;pouts the Water
fierce&s;t of all when he is wounded, then it
&s;ounds as the roaring of the Sea in a great
Storm, and as we hear the Wind in a very hard
Storm. Behind this Bump the <HI>Whale</HI> is &s;ome|what
more bended in than the <HI>Finn-fi&s;h,</HI> yet
when they &s;wim you cannot well di&s;cern one
from the other, except you ob&s;erve it very
exactly, for it is only the Finn on the <HI>Finn-fi&s;h</HI>'s
Back that di&s;tingui&s;hes him from the <HI>Whale.</HI>
The Head of the <HI>Whale</HI> is not round at the top,
but &s;omewhat flat, and goeth down &s;loaping,
<PB N="135" REF="216">
like unto the tyling of an Hou&s;e, to the under
Lip. The under Lip is broader than the <HI>Whale</HI>
is in any part of the Body, and broade&s;t in the
middle; before and behind it is &s;omething
narrower, according to the &s;hape of the Head.
In one word, all the whole Fi&s;h is &s;haped like un|to
a Shoomaker's La&s;t, if you look upon it from
beneath. Behind the Knob or Bump where
the Finns are, between that and the Finns, are
his Eyes, which are not much bigger than tho&s;e
of a Bullock, with Eye-lids and Hair, like
Mens Eyes. The Cry&s;tal of the Eye is not
much bigger than a Pea, clear, white, and tran|&s;parent
as Cry&s;tal; the colour of &s;ome is yel|lowi&s;h,
of others quite white: The <HI>Seale</HI>'s are
three times as big as tho&s;e of the <HI>Whale.</HI> The
Eyes of the <HI>Whale</HI> are placed very low, almo&s;t
at the end of the upper Lip. Some bring along
with them from <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> &s;ome Bones, which
they pretend to be the Ears of the <HI>Whale;</HI> but I
can &s;ay nothing to this, becau&s;e I never &s;aw
any; but thus much I do remember, that I
have heard them &s;ay that they lye very deep.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whale</HI> doth not hear when he &s;pouts the
Water, wherefore he is ea&s;ie&s;t to be &s;truck at
that time. His Belly and Back are quite red,
and underneath the Belly they are commonly
white, yet &s;ome of them are Coal black; mo&s;t
of them that I &s;aw were white. They look
very beautiful when the Sun &s;hines upon them,
the &s;mall clear Waves of the Sea that are over
him gli&s;ten like Silver. Some of them are
marbled on their Back and Tail. Where he
hath been wounded there remaineth always a
white Scar. I under&s;tood of one of our Har|pooniers
that he once caught a <HI>Whale</HI> at <HI>Spitz|bergen</HI>
that was white all over. Half white I
<PB N="136" REF="217">
have &s;een &s;ome, but one above the re&s;t, which
was a Female, was a beautiful one; &s;he was all
over marbled black and yellow: Tho&s;e that are
black are not all of the &s;ame colour, for &s;ome
of them are as black as Velvet, others of a Coal
black, others of the colour of a <HI>Tench.</HI> When
they are well they are as &s;lippery as an Eel,
but one may &s;tand upon them, becau&s;e they are
&s;o &s;oft, that the Fle&s;h thereof giveth way to our
weight: And the outward Skin is thin, like
Parchment, and is ea&s;ily pulled off with ones
Hands when the Fi&s;h grows hot. I know not
whether the Skin is thus burnt by the inward
heat of the Fi&s;h when he lies dry a floating
upon the Water. The Sun beams &s;eem not to
have &s;o great power as to dry the Skin &s;o.
We found our fir&s;t <HI>Whale</HI> was &s;o much heated
by his hard &s;wimming that he &s;tunk alive; we
could pull off great pieces of the Skin, of the
length of a Man, which we could not do to
other Fi&s;hes that were not &s;o much heated:
But from <HI>Whales</HI> that have been dead &s;ome
days, and are dry, where al&s;o the Sun &s;hines
upon them, or when it doth not rain, one may
pull off a great deal of the Skin, but it &s;tinks
ba&s;ely of Train-oyl, or Fat, that ferments thro'
the Pores of the Skin. I know not what u&s;e to
make of this Skin, but I have &s;een Women tye
their Flax with it about the Di&s;taff.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whale</HI> lo&s;eth this beautiful white colour
when it groweth dry, for before there is more
black among&s;t it, which maketh the white &s;hew
the better, neither doth the black look &s;o well
after it is dry, for it groweth then browni&s;h.
When you hold the Skin again&s;t the light, you
&s;ee many &s;mall Pores in it, where the Sweat co|meth
through.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="217">
The Yard of the <HI>Whale</HI> is a &s;trong Sinew,
and according as they are in bigne&s;s, &s;ix, &s;even
or eight foot long, as I have &s;een my &s;elf.
Where this Yard is fixed the Skin is doubled,
&s;o that it lies ju&s;t like a Knife in a Sheath,
where you can &s;ee nothing of the Knife but
only a little of the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t. The part of Genera|tion
in the Female is ju&s;t &s;haped like as that of
four-legged Bea&s;ts. At the &s;ides of <HI>Pudendum</HI>
&s;tand out the two Brea&s;ts, with Nipples on
them, like unto tho&s;e of Cows: Some of the&s;e
Brea&s;ts are quite white, &s;ome are &s;peckled with
black and blew &s;pots, like a <HI>Lapwing</HI>'s Egg.
When they have no young ones they have but
&s;mall Brea&s;ts. I am informed, that when they
couple together they &s;tand upright, clo&s;e to one
another, with their Heads out of the Water;
which &s;eemeth very probable, becau&s;e they
cannot keep long under Water, and chefily in
&s;uch a heat. They &s;ay that they have but two
young ones at a time, for they have never
found more than two young ones within them.
How long they carry their young is not ea&s;ily
determined; &s;ome &s;ay they go as long as a Cow,
but it is very uncertain, he that will believe it
may. The Sperm of a <HI>Whale,</HI> when it is fre&s;h,
&s;mells like Wheaten-flower that is boiled in
Water, when it is &s;till hot it is very white;
one may draw it out in Threads like hot Seal|ing-wax,
Glew, or the like; when it groweth
cold it turns to a Musk-colour, and &s;mells &s;trong,
and little red Worms grow in it, like unto the
grey ones, that you may &s;ee in the Tab. <HI>P.</HI> mar|ked
with <HI>C.</HI> I have tryed &s;everal ways to keep
this Sperm &s;weet and fre&s;h, but I could never
make it like unto that <HI>Sperma-caeti</HI> which the
<HI>Apothecaries</HI> &s;ell in their Shops. One may dip
<PB N="138" REF="218">
of this Sperm whole Pails-full out of the Water,
for as well this as that of the <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI> and <HI>Seals</HI>
&s;wims upon the Sea like Fat, and we &s;ee abun|dance
of it in calm weather, &s;o that it doth
make the Sea all foul and &s;limy. I tryed to
dry this Sperm of a <HI>Whale</HI> in the Sun, and it
lookt like Snot, and when the thin Slime was dry|ed
away from it, looked like unto <HI>Fila meteorica,</HI>
&s;ave only that they are thicker and more heavy.
Another parcel I boiled in Sea-water, ju&s;t as I
took it out of the Water, until the Water was
evaporated from it, then I had &s;ome Sea-&s;alt,
and a na&s;ty brown Slime. The third parcel I
boiled in fre&s;h Water, and afterwards again in
Sea-water, and the longer I kept it afterwards
the more it &s;tunk, and the harder it grew. The
fourth parcel I intended to keep in the Salt
Water, with an intention to carry it along with
me to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but it di&s;&s;olved in the Water,
like Glew, and the Water became foul and
&s;tinking, &s;o that I could no ways make it like
the <HI>Sperma-ceti</HI> of the <HI>Apothecaries.</HI> Where the
Yard doth begin it is four-&s;quare, con&s;isting of
many &s;trong Sinews; if you dry them they are
as tran&s;parent as Fi&s;h-glew; out of the&s;e Sinews
the Seamen make twi&s;ted Whips. Their Bones
are hard, like unto them of great four-footed
Bea&s;ts, but porous, like unto a Spunge, and fil|led
with Marrow, when that is con&s;umed out
they will hold a great deal of Water, for the
holes are big, like unto the Wax of a Honey|comb.
Two great and &s;trong Bones hold up
the under Lip, they lye one again&s;t the other,
and both of them make a Figure like unto an
Half-moon, but one alone by it&s;elf makes a Fi|gure
like to a quarter of the Moon. Some of
the&s;e Bones I &s;aw at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> lying on the
<PB N="139" REF="218">
<HI>Strand,</HI> about 20 foot long, of a very white
colour, as if they had been calcined. Our Sea|men
bring &s;ome of the&s;e along with them home,
to &s;hew us how big &s;ome <HI>Whales</HI> are, which are
already whitened to their Hands, for tho&s;e that
come fre&s;h from a Whale &s;tink abominably, be|cau&s;e
of the Marrow that is in them. Their
Fle&s;h is cour&s;e and hard, m and it doth look like
unto that of a Bull; it is intermixd with many
Sinews; it is very dry and lean when it is boi|led,
becau&s;e their Fat is only between their Fle&s;h
and Skin: Some looks green and blew as our
Pouder'd Beef, chiefly where the Mu&s;cles meet
together; if one lets it lye a little, it grows
black and &s;tinking. The Fle&s;h of the Tail
boils tendere&s;t, and is not quite &s;o dry as that
of the Body. When we have a mind to eat of a
<HI>Whale,</HI> we cut great pieces off before the Tail,
where it is four-&s;quare, and boil it like other
Meat; good Beef I prefer far before it, yet
rather than be &s;tarved, I advi&s;e to eat <HI>Whale's
Fle&s;h,</HI> for none of our Men dyed of it, and the
French-men did eat almo&s;t daily of it, they
fling it &s;ometimes on the tops of their Tubs,
and let it lye until it is black, and yet they eat
it for all that. The Fle&s;h of a <HI>Whale,</HI> as well as
that of the <HI>Seale&s;,</HI> is alone by it&s;elf, and the Fat
at the top thereof, between the Fle&s;h and Skin.
It is about &s;ix inches thick on the Back and Bel|ly,
but I have al&s;o &s;een it a foot thick, upon a
Finn, according as they are great or little
Fi&s;h. The Fat of their under Lip is thicker
than two foot, and is the thicke&s;t of all the
<HI>Whale.</HI> The Tongue, as I have &s;aid before, is
fa&s;ten'd to it, but very &s;oft, but it co&s;ts too much
labour to cut it. The Fat of &s;ome Whales is
much thicker than than that of others, as it is
<PB N="140" REF="219">
with other Animals or Men, where one is much
leaner that another. In the Fat are little Si|news,
inter&s;per&s;ed which hold the Oyl, as a
Sponge does Water, which one may &s;queeze
out. The other &s;trong Sinews are chiefly about
the Tail, where it is thinne&s;t, for with it he
turns and winds him&s;elf, as a Ship is turned by
the Rudder, but his Finns are his Oars, and ac|cording
to his bigne&s;s he rows him&s;elf along
with them as &s;wiftly as a Bird flies, and doth
make a long track in the Sea, as a great Ship
doth when under Sail, &s;o that it remains divi|did
for a while.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whales of the North Cape</HI> (they are &s;o cal|led,
becau&s;e they are caught between <HI>Spitzber|gen</HI>
and <HI>Norway</HI>) being not &s;o big, therefore do
not yield &s;o much Fat as tho&s;e of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI>
for of tho&s;e of the <HI>North Cape</HI> you &s;hall not fill
above ten, twenty, or thirty Cardels of Fat;
the middling &s;ort of tho&s;e of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> yield
commonly &s;eventy, eighty, or ninety, and they
are about fifty or &s;ixty foot long. Our bigge&s;t
<HI>Whale</HI> was fifty three foot long, and we cut off
him as much Fat as filled &s;eventy Cardels; his
Tail was about three fathom and an half broad.
The Skipper <HI>Peter Peter&s;on</HI> of <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> informed
me, that they found a dead Whale, whereof
they did cut as much fat as filled One hundred
and thirty Cardels, his Tail was three fathom
and an half broad, but he was not much longer
than our bigge&s;t, as one may gue&s;s by the Tail
al&s;o, yet much thicker and fatter; from whence
one may in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er, that they do not grow much
longer, but only in thickne&s;s or fatne&s;s, as we
daily &s;ee: Nor did I ever hear that a bigger or
fatter <HI>Whale</HI> was ever caught, and even tho&s;e
but &s;eldom, for if there were many &s;uch, our
<PB N="141" REF="219">
Ships could not hold &s;o much Fat as is cut from
ten, fifteen, or twenty <HI>Whales,</HI> as &s;ome of them
have &s;ometimes taken in.</P>
<P>Over the Fat is, be&s;ides the uppermo&s;t thin
Skin already de&s;cribed, another Skin of about
an inch thick, proportionable to the bigne&s;s
of the <HI>Whale;</HI> it is coloured according to the
colour of the Fi&s;h; if the Fi&s;h be black, this
undermo&s;t thick Skin is &s;o; if the outmo&s;t Skin
that is like Parchment is white or yellow, the
thick one underneath it is of the &s;ame colour.
This thick Skin is not &s;tiff nor tough at all, &s;o
that one might dre&s;s it like Leather, but it
dries ju&s;t like unto the Fungus that grows on
Elder, which we call <HI>Jews-ears,</HI> which are
thick and turgid when they are green and
fre&s;h, but brittle when they are dried; where|fore
this Skin is not e&s;teemed at all. This and
the uppermo&s;t thin Skin that covers this, are
the occa&s;ion that the <HI>Whale,</HI> which I take to
be the &s;tronge&s;t and bigge&s;t of all Creatures in
the Water, cannot make u&s;e of his Strength,
becau&s;e they are too &s;oft to do much.</P>
<P>I have nothing to relate of the inward parts
of the <HI>Whale,</HI> but only that his Guts &s;eem to
be of a Fle&s;h colour; they were full of Wind,
and the Dung that was within them was yel|low.</P>
<P>The Food of the <HI>Whale,</HI> as it is believed, are
the &s;mall Sea-Snails, the Draught whereof you
may &s;ee at <HI>c,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q,</HI> whereof I have
made mention in another place, which &s;ome
take for Spiders; whether the&s;e afford &s;uch
great nouri&s;hment, I cannot exactly tell. Some
&s;ay, that they live only by the Wind, but then
methinks they mu&s;t have nothing in them but
Wind, which I found otherwi&s;e. I was infor|med
<PB N="142" REF="220">
by others, that about <HI>Hitland</HI> a &s;mall <HI>Whale</HI>
was caught, had about a Barrel of <HI>Herrings</HI> in
his Belly. They are &s;maller <HI>Whales</HI> than tho&s;e
we catch at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but there is more dan|ger
in catching of them, they being le&s;s and
nimbler than the great ones, to whom the
Water doth not &s;o ea&s;ily give way as to the&s;e,
for they jump and play in the Water, and keep
their Tail commonly above Water, &s;o that one
dare not come near to them to launce them.
Concerning the <HI>Whale</HI>'s Valour, we do find
that he is not very couragious, according to
his &s;trength and bigne&s;s, for if he &s;ees a Man
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Long-boat, he goeth under Water, and
runs away. I did never &s;ee nor hear, that out
of his own Malice he endeavour'd to hurt any
Man, but when he is in danger; what then he
doth is of nece&s;&s;ity, and then he doth not va|lue
a man no more than a Sand, nor a Long|boat,
for he doth beat them all into Splinters.
His Strength may be gue&s;s'd by the Fi&s;hermen
that catch with great Nets other Fi&s;hes, when
they are going to draw their Nets towards the
Land, what a great Strength they mu&s;t u&s;e,
which is nothing at all to be compared to his
Strength. The <HI>Whale</HI> doth &s;wim &s;ometimes
away with &s;ome thou&s;and fathoms of Rope-line,
&s;wifter a great deal than a Ship can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, or a
Bird can fly, &s;o that it makes their Heads gid|dy;
yet a great Ship is too many for him, for
although he &s;hould &s;trike again&s;t it with his
Tail, yet it doth him more hurt than he does
the Ship.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whales</HI> keep, in the Spring, We&s;tward
from <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> near old <HI>Greenland</HI> and the
I&s;land of <HI>John Majen;</HI> then they run Ea&s;twards
to <HI>Spitzbergen:</HI> After them come the <HI>Finn-fi&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="220">
and then there is no more <HI>Whales</HI> &s;een. It is
probable they go after a tolerable cold place;
for after that, I have &s;een <HI>Finn-fi&s;h</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Sea in the year 1671. in the Month of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI>
and in the Year 1672. in <HI>January,</HI> and al&s;o
afterwards in the year 1673. in the <HI>Straights</HI> of
<HI>Gibralter</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> and al&s;o in the <HI>Mediterra|nean.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;wims again&s;t the Wind, as all other
<HI>Whales</HI> or great Fi&s;h do. The <HI>Sword-fi&s;h</HI> is his
mortal Enemy, he might rather be called <HI>Comb-fi&s;h,</HI>
becau&s;e his long Tooth is on each &s;ide full
of Teeth or Prickles, mo&s;t like a Comb. In
our Home-Voyage to <HI>Hamburg</HI> I &s;aw an Exam|ple
of this Enmity of a <HI>Northcaper-Whale</HI> and a
<HI>Sword-fi&s;h,</HI> near to <HI>Hitland,</HI> they fought and
&s;truck at one another &s;o vehemently, that the
Water flew about like Du&s;t, &s;ometimes one and
&s;ometimes the other was uppermo&s;t; the wea|ther
was a little &s;tormy, or el&s;e we had &s;tayed
to have &s;een the end of the Battel, &s;o we were
forced to leave them.</P>
<P>The dead <HI>Whale</HI> killed by the <HI>Sword-fi&s;h</HI> &s;tinks
at a great di&s;tance, but not pre&s;ently, and tho&s;e
that have been wounded &s;ome days before they
are caught &s;mell the wor&s;t, and drive high
above the Sea-water, when others drive even
with the Water; and &s;ome &s;ink.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whales</HI> have, as well as other Bea&s;ts,
their peculiar Di&s;tempers and Aliments, but
I can only write of what I know by Hear-&s;ay.
An ancient and experienc'd Harpoonier infor|med
me, that he did once catch a <HI>Whale</HI> that
was very feeble, and that all his Skin, but
chiefly near unto the Tail and Finns, hung like
Films, as if they were old Rags dragg'd along
<PB N="144" REF="221">
behind him, and that he was quite fean, &s;o
they made but very little Train oyl of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">at,
for the fat was quite white, and light withal as
an empty Honey-comb. Before a Tempe&s;t
they beat the Water, that it doth fly about like
upon Du&s;t, with their Tail; but they have
the greate&s;t &s;trength when they &s;trike &s;ide|wards
as if they did mow, &s;o that one might
think that they were in a great agony, and
a dying. They are mightily tormented by the
Lice, whereof I have treated more at large
above: The Draught of this Lou&s;e you may
&s;ee at <HI>d,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q.</HI></P>
<P>The Wounds that are given unto the <HI>Whale</HI>
by the Harpoons, into the fat, heal up again
of their own accord, for the Salt-water cannot
&s;tick on it. Many <HI>&s;uch Fi&s;hes</HI> are caught, that
have been &s;truck by others with a Harpoon,
and are healed up again, and &s;o have white
Scarrs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How they Catch the Whale.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t, it is to be ob&s;erved, that when it is like
to be a good Year to catch <HI>Whales</HI> in, there
is many <HI>White-fi&s;h</HI> to be &s;een before: But where
we &s;ee many <HI>Seales,</HI> there we do not expect to
meet with many <HI>Whales;</HI> for they &s;ay, that
they eat up the Food of the <HI>Whale,</HI> wherefore
the <HI>Whales</HI> will not &s;tay in &s;uch empty places,
but go to find out better, and &s;o come to <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
for there, at the Shoar, we &s;ee great
plenty of the &s;mall Sea-&s;nails, (you may &s;ee
them marked with <HI>e</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q</HI>) and per|haps
&s;ome other &s;mall Fi&s;h. They are caught
after the following manner: When they &s;ee
<HI>Whales,</HI> or when they hear them blow or &s;pout,
they call in to the Ship, <HI>Fall, fall;</HI> then every
Body mu&s;t be ready to get into the Long-boat
that he doth belong to, commonly &s;ix Men go
into every Long-boat, and &s;ometimes &s;even,
according as the Long-boats are in bigne&s;s, they
all of them row until they come very near un|to
the <HI>whale,</HI> then doth the Harpoonier ari&s;e,
who &s;its always before in the Boat, where the
Harpoon or the &s;harp Iron made like unto an
Arrow fixed to a Stick, doth al&s;o lye on the
foremo&s;t Board of the Long-boat, which the
Seamen call the <HI>Staffen,</HI> that is, the broad piece
of Wood that cometh up before the Boat from
<PB N="146" REF="222">
the bottom, and &s;tands up higher than all the
re&s;t. But when the <HI>Whale</HI> runs &s;treight down
towards the bottom underneath the Wa|ter,
then he doth draw the Rope very hard, &s;o
that the upper part of the Long-boat is even
with the &s;urface of the Water; nay, he would
certainly pull it down to the bottom, if they
&s;hould not give him Rope enough: This he
doth commonly where the Sea is deepe&s;t; and
this doth require an incredible force to draw &s;o
many hundred fathoms of Rope under Water.
This giveth me occa&s;ion to remember, that
when we on the 27th of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year
1672. did fling out our Lead, near St. <HI>Kilda,</HI>
behind <HI>Scotland,</HI> into the Sea, where it was 120
fathom deep when the Weather was calm, and
when we would pull it up again, it was &s;o heavy
that 20 Men had much to do to heave it.
The Harpoonier taketh his Harpoon, and holds
the Point or the Iron thereof, together with the
Fore-runner, towards his Left hand: this is a
Rope or Line of five or &s;even fathom long,
about an inch thick, and is laid up round like
a Ring, that it may not hinder the Harpoon
when it is flung, for as &s;oon as he doth fling or
dart the Harpoon this Line follows, for it is
more plyable than the re&s;t that are fa&s;tened to
it, wherewith they pur&s;ue the <HI>Whale.</HI> It is made
of the fine&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t Hemp, and not daubed
with Tarr, but it doth &s;well in the Water, and
&s;o it grows hard. The Harpoonier darts his
Harpoon with the Right hand at the Fi&s;h; as
you may &s;ee by <HI>m</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI> When the
<HI>Whale</HI> is hit with the Harpoon, all the Men
that are in the Long-boat turn them&s;elves about
and look before them, and they lay their Oars
nimbly upon the &s;ides of the Long-boat. There
<PB N="147" REF="222">
is a Man in the Long-boat, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is
to look after the Rope; as you may &s;ee at <HI>N,</HI>
in the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> for in each of the&s;e Long-boats
there is a whole heap of Lines, between the
two Seats or Benches; this Heap is divided in|to
three, four, or five parts, and each of them
is of eighty, ninety, to one hundred fathoms
long. The fir&s;t of them is tyed to the Fore|runner,
or &s;mall Line; as the <HI>Whale</HI> runs under
the Water, they tye more and more Line to it,
and if in one Boat there &s;hould not be enough,
they make u&s;e of tho&s;e that are in the other
Long boats. The&s;e Ropes or Lines are thicker
and &s;tronger than the Fore-runner, and are
made of &s;trong and tough Hemp, and Tarred
over. The Line-furni&s;her, or the man that
doth look after the Ropes, and al&s;o the other
Men that are in the Long-boat, mu&s;t have great
care that the Ropes or Lines may not be en|tangled
when they run out &s;o &s;wift, or that
they may not run towards the &s;ide of the Long-boat,
for then the Long-boat would be over|&s;et,
and many Men lo&s;e their Lives, if other
Long-boats were not near to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
The Line mu&s;t run ju&s;t before, in the middle
of the Long-boat, that is called the <HI>Stave</HI> by
the Seamen, and by rea&s;on of this &s;trong and
violent motion the Wood and Rope, would be
&s;et on fire. But to prevent this, the Harpoonier
hath a wet Rag tied to a Stick (like unto a
Mop) ready at hand, wherewith he wets the
Wood without cea&s;ing. The other three Men
that are in the Long-boats take al&s;o care of the
Lines, as well when they are let out, as when
they are taken in again, and when they cannot
hold it with their Hands, they wind it about
the Staves of the Boat, and &s;o they do &s;top it
<PB N="146" REF="223">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="147" REF="223">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="148" REF="224">
from going any further. Another that is cal|led
the Steerman, &s;tands behind in the Long|boat,
as you may &s;ee by <HI>o</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> and
&s;teers the Boat with an Oar, and he takes great
care, and minds the Rope, to &s;ee which way
it runs out, for if it doth go towards either &s;ide,
and doth not run ju&s;t before over the Stave, he
&s;o guides the Boat, that it may run exactly out
before. The Whale runs away with the Long-boat
as &s;wift as the Wind. If the Harpoonier
can, he doth dart the Harpoon ju&s;t behind the
Spout-hole of the <HI>Whale</HI> or in the thick Fat of his
Back, where they al&s;o do launce him, for that
maketh him &s;pout Blood &s;ooner than if woun|ded
in any other place, and dye &s;ooner than if
you &s;hould launce them into their Belly, or
through the Guts. The fir&s;t <HI>Whale,</HI> we caught
&s;pouted Blood, in &s;uch a quantity, that the Sea
was tinged by it where-ever he &s;wam, where|unto
the <HI>Mallemucks</HI> flock'd in great numbers,
as I have mentioned before. They al&s;o launce
the <HI>Whales</HI> near their privy parts, if they can
come at it, for if they are run in there it doth
pain them very much; nay, even when they
are almo&s;t dead, if you run in your Launce
thereabout, it cau&s;es the whole Body to trem|ble.
For the mo&s;t part they do not much
mind where they launce or pu&s;h them, for
there is no time to take great deliberation, but
they &s;trike at him as well as they can. But
about the Head the Harpoon can do him no
hurt, becau&s;e the Fat is but very <HI>thin</HI> there upon
the Bones, which the <HI>Whales</HI> know as well as we;
for when they find them&s;elves in danger, &s;o
that they cannot e&s;cape the Harpoon, they
rather leave their Head than their Back unde|fended,
for there the Harpoon breaks out ea&s;ier,
<PB N="149" REF="224">
and &s;o the <HI>Whale</HI> gets away, like one that hath
no mind to fight any longer. The U&s;e of the
Harpoon is, to tye, as it were, the <HI>Whales</HI> with
them, that they may not run away: It is &s;ha|ped
like an Arrow before, as you may &s;ee at <HI>f,</HI>
in the Tab. <HI>&abque;</HI> it hath two &s;harp Beards, they
are &s;harp at the edge, and have a broad Back,
like unto a Hatchet that is &s;harp before and
blunt behind, or on the Back, &s;o that it may
not cut with its Back, for el&s;e it would tear out
and all your Labour would be lo&s;t. The Iron
Handle is thicker behind than before, and it is
hollow, whereinto they put the Stick, as you
may &s;ee in the Tab. <HI>Q,</HI> marked with <HI>h.</HI> Be|fore
this hollow part, the Fore-goer is fa|&s;ten'd
or tyed, that is to &s;ay the foremo&s;t Rope,
as you may &s;ee in the Tab. <HI>Q,</HI> marked with <HI>i.</HI>
Tho&s;e are the be&s;t Harpoons that are made of
clean and fine Steel, and are not hardened too
much, &s;o that you may bend it without &s;nap|ping,
for oftentimes Two hundred Pounds are
lo&s;t (for a midling <HI>Whale</HI> is e&s;teem'd at &s;o much)
in a minutes time for want of a good and well-temper'd
Harpoon. The Wooden Stick is fa|&s;tened
within the Iron Collet or Funnel of the
Harpoon, with Packthread wound all about
the Iron; &s;omewhat higher up, about two &s;pans
off, there is a hole made through the Stick, as
you may &s;ee marked with <HI>k,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q.</HI>
The Harpoon is light behind, and heavy to|wards
the point, or before, like an Arrow, that
is made heavy before with Iron, and light be|hind
with Feathers, &s;o that fling it which way
you will, it doth fall always upon the point.
Through this hole cometh a piece of Pack-thread,
wherewith the end of the Fore-runner
is fa&s;tened to the Handle or Stick of the Har|poon,
<PB N="150" REF="225">
but this is &s;oon torn off, and it &s;erveth
for nothing more after the Harpoon &s;ticks in
the Body of the <HI>Whale;</HI> neither is the Wooden
Handle of any further u&s;e, and &s;o it doth &s;oon
come out from the Iron. When the <HI>Whale</HI> is
&s;truck with the Harpoon, all the other Long-boats
row out before, and take notice which
way the Line doth &s;tand, and &s;ometimes they
pull at the Rope or Line (as you may &s;ee in
the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> marked with <HI>p.</HI>) If it is &s;tiff and
heavy, the <HI>Whale</HI> doth draw it &s;till with his
might; but if it doth hang loo&s;e, &s;o that the
Long-boat is before and behind equally high
out of the Water, then the Men pull in the
Rope again, (as you may &s;ee in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI>
marked with <HI>q</HI>) and the Rope-giver layeth it
down in very good order (as you may &s;ee at
<HI>n,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A</HI>) round, and one row above
the other, that if the <HI>Whale</HI> &s;hould draw on
again, he may have it ready to give him with|out
being entangled. Here is al&s;o this to be
ob&s;erved, that if the <HI>Whale</HI> runs upon the level
they mu&s;t not give him too much Rope, for if
he &s;hould turn and wind him&s;elf much and of|ten
about, he might ea&s;ily wind the Rope about
a Rock or heavy Stone, and &s;o fa&s;ten it to it,
and &s;o the Harpoon would come out, and all
the Labour would be lo&s;t; which hath often
hapned, and we our&s;elves lo&s;t one that way.
The other Long-boats that are towed behind,
wherein the Men look all before them, and &s;it
&s;till, and let the <HI>Whale</HI> draw them along: If
the <HI>Whale</HI> doth rowl upon the Ground, &s;o that
the Long-boats or Sloops lye &s;till, they draw
their Lines in again by degrees, and the Rope-ma&s;ter
doth lay them down again in their pro|per
places, as they had been laid before. When
<PB N="151" REF="225">
they kill the <HI>Whale</HI> with Launces, they al&s;o pull
their Lines in again, until they come near to the
<HI>Whale,</HI> yet at &s;ome di&s;tance, that the others may
have room to launce: But they mu&s;t have great
care, that all the Lines of every Sloop may not
be cut off together, becau&s;e &s;ome <HI>Whales</HI> &s;ink,
and others do &s;wim even with the Water when
they are dead, which no body can tell before|hand,
whether they will do one or the other.
The fat ones do not &s;ink pre&s;ently after they are
fre&s;h killed, but the lean ones &s;ink immediately
after they are dead, but after &s;ome few days
they come up again, and &s;wim on the Water:
But it would be too long a while for a Man to
&s;tay until he cometh up again, and the Sea is
never &s;o quiet that one can &s;tay long in the
&s;ame place, and where the Sea is quiet, and
without Waves, there the Stream doth carry
the Ships and the Ice along together, &s;o that
we &s;hould be forced to leave the <HI>Whale</HI> unto
others, that would find him dead &s;ome days af|ter.
'T'is true, this is the ea&s;ie&s;t way to catch
<HI>Whales,</HI> but it is very na&s;ty and &s;tinking work;
for long and white Maggots grow in their Fle&s;h,
they are flat like unto Worms that breed in
Mens Bellies, and they &s;mell wor&s;e than ever I
&s;melt any thing in my Life. The longer the
<HI>Whale</HI> lies dead in the Water, the higher he doth
&s;wim above it; &s;ome &s;wim a foot high above
the Water, others to their middle, and then
they do bur&s;t ea&s;ily, and give a very great re|port.
They begin immediately to &s;tink, and
this encrea&s;es hourly, and their Fle&s;h boils and
ferments like unto Beer or Ale, and holes break
in their Bellies, that their Guts come out. If
any Man is enclined to &s;ore Eyes, this Vapour
enflames them immediately, as if Quicklime
<PB N="152" REF="226">
was flung into them. But when the live <HI>Whales</HI>
ri&s;e and &s;wim again, &s;ome of them are a&s;toni&s;h'd,
others wild or &s;tark mad: To tho&s;e that are
wild we come &s;oftly or gently from behind,

<PB N="153" REF="226">
very dangerous to kill a Female, chiefly when
&s;he is big with young, for they defend them|&s;elves
very long, and are harder to be killed
than a Male one. Oftentimes the Long-boats
wait &s;ix or &s;even hours, nay, a whole day, for
a <HI>Whale;</HI> before they &s;ee one.</P>
<P>Where great quantity of &s;mall Ice is crowded
together, there it is al&s;o very dangerous, and
hard to come to the <HI>Whale,</HI> for he is &s;o cun|ning,
that when he perceives where the Ice is
he retires thither immediately. The Harpoo|nier
&s;tands at the Head of the Long-boat, and
doth draw on the Rope, as you may &s;ee at <HI>p,</HI>
in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> to try whether it is heavy or
light; if it feels heavy, &s;o that we are afraid
that it will pull the Boat under Water, then
we give him more Rope, if he runs &s;treight
out before, he draweth the Sloops after him.
If he doth run underneath a great Ice-field,
the Harpoonier taketh a Knife into his Hand,
as you may &s;ee at <HI>R,</HI> in the Tab <HI>A,</HI> which
they call the Chopping-Knife, and if the Ice-field
be hollow, or &s;pungy, or full of holes in
the middle, &s;o that the <HI>Whale</HI> can fetch breath
underneath it, and the Rope is not long enough
to follow him, and if the Ice be &s;everal miles
long, they draw the Rope in as much as
po&s;&s;ibly they can, until it be &s;treight, and
then he chops it off, loo&s;ing the piece of the
Rope whereon the Harpoon is fa&s;tened, that
&s;ticketh in the Body of the <HI>Whale,</HI> yet not with|out
great lo&s;s, for oftentimes they run away
with the Lines that belong to five and more
Sloops. It happens very often, that they run
to the Ice with the Long-boats, &s;o that they
da&s;h again&s;t it, as if they would break it into
pieces, which al&s;o very often happens. But
<PB N="154" REF="227">
when the <HI>Whale</HI> ri&s;es again, they oftentimes
fling one or two more Harpoons into him,
according as they find he is tired more or le&s;s,
then he dives under Water again. Some &s;wim
or run even all along on the Water, and they
play with their Tail and Finns, &s;o that we
mu&s;t have great care that we may not come
too near them. When the <HI>Whales</HI> fling their
Tails about after this manner, they wind the
Line about their Tail, &s;o that we need not to
fear the Harpoon tearing out, for then they
are ty'd &s;trong and firm enough with the Rope.
After they are wounded, they &s;pout with all
their might and main, &s;o that you may hear
them as far off as you may a Cannon;
but when they are quite tired, it cometh out
only by drops, for he hath not &s;trength enough
to force the Water up, and therefore it &s;ounds
as if you held an empty Mug or Bottle under
Water, and the Water runs into it. And this
&s;ound is a certain &s;ign of his feeblene&s;s, and
that he is going to expire. Some <HI>Whales</HI> blow
Blood to the very la&s;t, after they have been
wounded, and the&s;e da&s;h the Men in the Long-boats
mo&s;t filthily, and dye the Sloops as red
as if they were painted with a red colour;
nay, the very Sea is tinged red all along where
they &s;wim. Tho&s;e <HI>Whales</HI> that are mortally
wounded heat them&s;elves, that they reek while
they are alive, and the Birds &s;it on them, and
eat on them while they are &s;till alive. When
the <HI>Whales</HI> blow up the Water, they fling out
with it &s;ome fatti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance that floats upon
the Sea, like Sperm, and this Fat the <HI>Mallemucks</HI>
devour greedily, of which &s;everal thou&s;ands at|tend

Sometimes at the &s;ame time two Har|poons,
belonging to two &s;everal Ships are &s;truck
into the <HI>Whale,</HI> &s;uch ones are divided equally,
and each one hath half; as you may &s;ee at
<HI>MM,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> the other two, or three,
or more Sloops, as many as there is of them,
wait for the <HI>Whale</HI>'s coming up again, and when
they &s;ee that he is tired, they kill him outright
with Launces. In doing this is the greate&s;t
danger, for the fir&s;t that do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ing the Harpoon
into him are drawn along by the <HI>Whale,</HI> and
are at a good di&s;tance from him, but tho&s;e that
kill him with Launces are as well upon his Body
as at his Sides, according as the <HI>Whale</HI> turns
and winds him&s;elf, and they receive many se|vere
Blows. Here the Steer&s;man mu&s;t take
care to ob&s;erve how the <HI>Whale</HI> runs and turns
him&s;elf about, that the Harpoonier may reach
him with his Launces; all the other Men in the
Sloops row diligently, &s;ometimes forwards, and
&s;ometimes backwards, which they call <HI>rowing
on</HI> and <HI>&s;triking,</HI> and when the <HI>Whale</HI> lifts up
him&s;elf out of the Water, he commonly doth
&s;trike about with his Tail and Finns, that the
Water da&s;heth up like Du&s;t. A Long-boat he
values no more than Du&s;t, for he can beat it
all into &s;hatters at a blow: but a great Ship is
too hard for him, and if he &s;trikes again&s;t it
with his Tail, he feels it more that the Ship,
<PB N="156" REF="228">
for he doth &s;o paint the Ship with his own
Blood, that it maketh him very feeble. A
good Steerman is next unto the Harpoonier
mo&s;t u&s;eful in the Sloop; he &s;teers with one
Oar, and doth look out before: the other four
Men turn their Back to the Head, and look to|wards
the Stern, therefore doth the Steerman
and Harpoonier always cry, <HI>Row on,</HI> or <HI>&s;trike,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, row near to the <HI>Whale,</HI> or el&s;e
keep farther off. The Launces have a Wooden
Stick or Handle above two fathoms long, or
&s;omewhat &s;horter than a Pike&s;taff; as in the
Tab. <HI>Q.</HI> you may &s;ee at <HI>g;</HI> the Iron thereof is
commonly a fathom long, and pointed before
like unto a Pike; it is made of Steel or tough
Iron, that it may bend without breaking: for
after you have made a deep hole in his Body
with your Launces, you poke into it with them
one way and the other way, as they do when
they poke for Eels, as you may &s;ee at <HI>Z,</HI> in
the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> but if he doth get one or more
out of your Hands, you take another, for every

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What they do with the dead Whale.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the <HI>Whale</HI> is killed they cut off his
Tail; &s;ome keep the Tail and Finns, and
hang them up at the out&s;ide of their Ship, for
that defends them from the Ice when it pre&s;|&s;eth
upon the Ship: The Tail hinders the Boat
in its cour&s;e, becau&s;e it doth lye cro&s;s, and that
is the rea&s;on why they cut it off. Before the
Tail they fa&s;ten to a piece of a Rope, and at the
other end at the Stern of the la&s;t Sloop, as you
may &s;ee in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> marked with <HI>W.</HI> There
is in all four or five Sloops fa&s;tened to one ano|ther
behind, and &s;o they row one behind the
other to the great Ship. When they have
brought the <HI>Whale</HI> to the Ship, they tye it with
Ropes fa&s;t to the Ship; that part where the
Tail is cut off they fa&s;ten the fore-part of
the Ship, and the Head towards the Stern,
about the middle, near the great Shrowds of
the Mainma&s;t on the Larboard of the Ship; it
is &s;eldom that a <HI>Whale</HI> doth reach farther than
from the Poop to the middle of the Ship, ex|cept
the Ve&s;&s;els are very &s;mall; as you may
&s;ee at <HI>X,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>By the Larboard is to be under&s;tood that &s;ide
of the Ship that is at your Right Hand as you
go from before towards the Stern; but that &s;ide
of the Ship that is on your Right Hand as you
<PB N="158" REF="229">
go from the Stern towards the Fore-part is cal|led
Star-board, becau&s;e you go from the Steer
forward.</P>
<P>Whoever of the Ships Crew &s;ees a dead
<HI>Whale,</HI> cries out <HI>Fi&s;h mine,</HI> and therefore the
Merchants mu&s;t pay him a Ducat, for his Care
and Vigilance. Many of them climb often
up into the Ma&s;t in hopes to have a Ducat,
but in vain.</P>
<P>When the dead <HI>Whale</HI> is thus fa&s;tened to the
Ship, two Sloops hold on the other &s;ide of the
Fi&s;h or Whale, and in each of them doth &s;tand
a Man or Boy, that has a long Hook in his
Hands, wherewith he doth hold the Boat to
the Ship, and the Harpoonier &s;tands before in
the Sloop, or upon the Whale, with a Leathern
Suit on, and &s;ometimes they have boots on.
Underneath the Hook are &s;ome &s;harp Nails
fixed, that they may be able to &s;tand firm, for
the Whale is very &s;lippery, &s;o that one may ea|&s;ily
fall, as upon &s;lippery Ice. The&s;e two Men
that cut the Fat off have their peculiar Wages
for it, <HI>viz.</HI> about four or five Rix Dollars.
Fir&s;t, they cut a large piece from behind the
Head, by the Eyes, which they call the <HI>Ken|ter
piece,</HI> that is as much as to &s;ay the Wnding-piece;
for, as they cut all the other Fat all in
rows, from the Whale towards the end, &s;o they
cut this great <HI>Kenter-piece</HI> larger and wider than
all the re&s;t. This piece, when it is cut round
about from the Whale, reaches from the
Water to the Cradle, (that is the round Circle
that goeth round about the middle of the Ma&s;t,
and is made in the &s;hape of a Basket) from
whence you may gue&s;s at the bigne&s;s of a
Whale. A &s;trong and thick Rope is fixed to
this <HI>Kenter-piece,</HI> and the other end is fixed un|derneath
<PB N="159" REF="229">
the Cradle, whereby the Whale is as
it was born up out of the Water, that they may
come at it, and by rea&s;on of the great weight
of the Whale, the Ship leans towards that &s;ide.
One may judge how tough the Fat is, for in
this piece an hole is made, through which the
Rope is fa&s;tened, yet not deep into the Fat,
wherewith they turn the Fi&s;h at plea&s;ure; as
you may &s;ee at <HI>K,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI> Then, as is
before &s;aid, they cut another piece down hard
by this, that is al&s;o halled up to the Ship; as
you may &s;ee at <HI>L,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> and then in
the Ship they cut it into le&s;s pieces about a
foot &s;quare. The&s;e two Men have in their
Hands, as well as tho&s;e that &s;tand on the Whale,
long Knives, wherewith they cut the&s;e &s;quare
pieces. The&s;e Knives are, with their Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ts,
about the length of a Man; and the more the
Fat of the Whale is loo&s;ened, ju&s;t as the Hide
is flea'd from an Ox, the higher mu&s;t they pull
up the Fat with their Pulleys, that they may
cut it the ea&s;ier. And when they have drawn
up this Fat, the Men take it in to them into
the Ship, and loo&s;en the Rope that is was fa&s;te|ned
unto. The Rope is fa&s;tened with a Ring,
whereinto they put a great Iron Hook, which
is fa&s;tened to a &s;trong Tackle, and al&s;o &s;ome|times,
before in the Ship, are fixed two other
Tackle, wherewith all the Fat is drawn up into
the Ship. In the Ship &s;tand two Men, with
Hooks as long as a Man, wherewith they hold
the great piece of Fat, which the two Men cut
into &s;quare pieces with their long Knives. By
them &s;tands another, that hath a &s;hort Hook
with a Ring in his Hands, which he thru&s;ts in|to
the pieces of Fat that are cut &s;quare, and
puts it upon the Bench or Dre&s;&s;ing-board, where
<PB N="160" REF="230">
it is cut by others into le&s;s pieces. The two
fir&s;t Men with their long Knives, that cut the
large pieces of Fat, &s;tand near the Larboard of
the Ship, at that &s;ide where the Whale is fixed,
and the other Men that afterwards cut it into
le&s;s pieces, &s;tand on the other &s;ide called Star-board,
as you may &s;ee at <HI>I,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI>
when it is a good time to catch Whales, and
they will not lo&s;e it, they tow &s;ometimes &s;e|veral
Fi&s;h behind their Ship, and catch more;
and they cut only the great pieces of Fat of
them, and fling them underneath into the Ship-But
when they have no more Ve&s;&s;els to put
their Fat into, they &s;ail into an Harbour; or if
it be calm weather, and not windy, they &s;tay
in the Sea, and fa&s;ten them&s;elves to a &s;heet of
Ice, and &s;o they drive along with the Stream.
The other Men cut the Fat into &s;mall pieces,
on a Table; on the further &s;ide of the Table is
a Nail fa&s;tened, whereunto they fa&s;ten a Hook,
which they put into the Fat, that it may lye
&s;teddy when they cut it into &s;mall pieces, the
Fat is tough to cut, wherefore it mu&s;t lye firm.
That &s;ide whereon the Skin is they lay under|mo&s;t,
and &s;o cut the Fat from it by pieces. The
Knives wherewith they cut the Fat into &s;mall
pieces are le&s;s than the other, about three foot
long with their Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ts. They all cut from them
that they may not be bedaubed with the Fat,
which might occa&s;ion a &s;hrinking up and lame|ne&s;s
of the Sinews of their Hands and Arms.
One of them cuts the &s;oft and tough Fat into
&s;mall pieces with a long Knife; this Man they
call the <HI>Chopper,</HI> and he is mightily daubed,
wherefore he doth hang about him all &s;orts of
Rags and Clouts he can get. The Fat of &s;ome
Whales is white, of others yellow, and of &s;ome
<PB N="161" REF="230">
red. The white Fat is full of &s;mall Sinews,
and it does not yield &s;o much Oyl as the yellow.
The yellow Fat that looks like Butter is the
be&s;t. The red and watery Fat cometh from
dead <HI>Whales,</HI> for in the place where the Fat
runs out the Blood &s;ettles in its room, and yields
the wor&s;t and lea&s;t Oyl. Before the Table is a
Gutter made of two Boards nailed together,
whereinto the &s;mall or minced Fat is flung;
by it &s;tands a Boy that &s;huffles the Fat by de|grees
into a Bag that is fixed to the end of the
Gutter, and is like unto a Pudding-bag, &s;o long
that it reaches down into the Ship; out of this
Bag the Fat runs down into a Tub or Wooden
Funnel, which they put upon empty Ve&s;&s;els
or Cardels, as they call them, and the Men that
are below in the Ship fill them with it, and &s;o
it is kept until they try it up into Train-oyl.
When the Fat is cut off from one &s;ide of the
<HI>Whale,</HI> before they turn him, they cut out the
Whale-bone in one entire piece, and this is &s;o
heavy, that all the Ship's Crew hath enough to
do to pull it up. They make u&s;e, for that pur|po&s;e,
of a peculiar &s;ort of Hooks, two whereof
they fix on the &s;ides, and one on the middle of
it, very well provided with &s;trong Tackle, as
you may &s;ee in the Tab. <HI>R,</HI> and afterwards
they cut out the Whale-bone of the other &s;ide
of the Fi&s;h, and draw it up al&s;o with Pulleys
into the Ship, where it is cut into &s;uch pieces
as they bring it hither in. The Whale-bone
doth only belong to the owners of the Ship,
and the others that run their hazard, whether
they catch few or many <HI>Whales.</HI> The re&s;t,
which take their Pay by the Month, receive
their Money when they come home, whether
they have caught many or none, and the Lo&s;s
<PB N="162" REF="231">
or Gain falls upon the Merchants. The Hooks
that they crane up the Whale-bone withal are
made on purpo&s;e for it, like a Beam of a pair of
Scales; on each end are two &s;harp points,
which they knock in between the Whale-bone;
in the middle of the Beam is fa&s;tened a long
Handle with a Ring, whereon the Ropes are
fa&s;tened; on this Handle there are fixed two
other crooked Hooks like Birds Claws; in the
Ring where the Ropes are fa&s;tened is another
crooked Hook, at the top fa&s;tened by a Ring,
&s;uch a one as we make u&s;e of here when we
wind any thing up by a Crane; but in the mid|dle
between the&s;e two Hooks is fa&s;tened ano|ther
Rope, which keeps the lowermo&s;t Hook
&s;teddy; the two hindmo&s;t points are knocked
into the Whale-bone behind, and the two fore|mo&s;t
&s;hort ones before, which hold the Whale-bone
fa&s;t between them when it is wound or
pulled up.</P>
<P>The dead <HI>Whales,</HI> when the Fat is cut off of
them, they let float, and are the Food of the
Birds of Prey, when they are hungry, but
but they had rather have dead <HI>Whales</HI> that have
&s;till their Fat left on them. The white Bear
is generally not far off, whether there be any
Fat left on them or no, and look like Dogs that
only feed upon Carrion, and at that time their
white Furr is turned into a yellow colour, and
at the &s;ame time they &s;hed their Hair, and
their Skins are worth very little. Where a dead
<HI>Whale</HI> is near we &s;ee it by the Birds, whereof are
many, and al&s;o the white Bears di&s;cover it, as
you may &s;ee at <HI>g</HI> in the Tab. <HI>B,</HI> chiefly in the
Spring, when but a few <HI>Whales</HI> are caught, for
then they are greedy of their Prey; afterwards
when many <HI>Whales</HI> float on the Sea, they have
<PB N="163" REF="231">
their Bellies full, and we do not find &s;o many
by a <HI>Whale,</HI> becau&s;e they are di&s;per&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trying out of the Train-oyl from&punc;
the Fat.</HEAD>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Dutch</HI> did try out their Train-oyl
in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> at <HI>Smerenberg,</HI> and about
the Cookery of <HI>Harlingen,</HI> where &s;till, for a re|membrance,
all &s;orts of Tools belonging there|unto
are to be &s;een, whereof I have make men|tion
before. The <HI>French-men</HI> try up their Train-oyl
in their Ships, and by that means many
Ships are burnt at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and this was the
occa&s;ion of the burning of two Ships in my
time. They try out their Train-oyl at <HI>Spitz|bergen,</HI>
that they may load the more Fat in
their Ships; and they believe it to be very pro|fitable,
for they go their Voyage upon part,
that is to &s;ay, they receive more or le&s;s, accor|ding
to what they catch; But I do not ac|count
it Wi&s;dom to fill up the room of the Ship
with Wood, where they might &s;tow Ve&s;&s;els.
But our Country-men, as I told you before, put
the Fat into the Ve&s;&s;els, wherein it doth fer|ment
ju&s;t like Beer, and I know no in&s;tance
that ever any Ve&s;&s;el did fly in pieces, although
they are &s;topt up very clo&s;e, and &s;o it becometh
for the greate&s;t part Train-oyl in them. Of
the fre&s;h Fat of <HI>Whales,</HI> when it is burnt out you
lo&s;e Twenty in the Hundred, more or le&s;s, ac|cording
<PB N="164" REF="232">
as it is in goodne&s;s. At the place
where they try up the Fat into Train-oyl, near
<HI>Hamburgh,</HI> they put the Fat out of the Ve&s;&s;els
into a great wooden Trough or Tub, and out
of this two Men empty it into a great Kettle
that &s;tands near it, that doth hold two Cardels
of Fat, that makes 120, 130, and &s;ometimes
140 Gallons: Underneath this Copper that is
made-up with Bricks they put the Fire, and &s;o
they boil it, and try it up into Train-oyl, as
you try up other Fat. This Copper is very well
&s;ecured, as the Dyers Coppers u&s;e to be: it is
very broad and flat, ju&s;t like a Frying-pan,
made of Copper. When the Fat is well tryed
or fryed out, they take it out of the Pan with
&s;mall Kettles, into a great Sieve, that the liquid
only may run through, the re&s;t is thrown away.
This Sieve &s;tands over a great Tub, which is
above half filled with cold Water, that the hot
Train-oyl may be cooled, and that what is
unclean and dirty of the Blood and other Soil
may fall to the bottom, and only the clear
Train-oyl &s;wim at the top of the Water, like
other Oyl. In this great Tub or Trough is a

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Finn-fi&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Finn-fi&s;h</HI> is of the length of a <HI>Whale,</HI>
but in bulk the <HI>Whale</HI> is three times as big.
They know the <HI>Finn-fi&s;h</HI> by the Finns that are
upon his Back, near unto his Tail, and al&s;o by
his vehement blowing and &s;pouting up of the
Water, which the <HI>Whale</HI> doth not do. His
Knob on the Head is &s;plit in length, that is at
his blowing hole, through which he forces up
the Water higher than the <HI>Whale,</HI> and with
more fiercene&s;s, which is not &s;o high as that of
the <HI>Whale,</HI> neither is the Back bended or den|ted
in &s;o much. His Lips are of a browni&s;h
colour, and like a twi&s;ted Rope. On his upper
Lip the Whale-bone hangs, as it doth on the
<HI>Whale;</HI> but whether he doth open and &s;hut his
Mouth there are different Opinions: Some be|lieve
that he cannot open his Mouth, yet this
is not true; but he doth not always run open
Mouth'd, that the Whale-bone may not hang
out of his Mouth at the &s;ides, as it doth in
Whales, for el&s;e he can open his Mouth if he
plea&s;es. Within his Mouth, between the
Whale-bone, he is all over hairy, like unto
Hor&s;es Hairs, which grows within to the
Whale-bone that is but new growing, and it is
<PB N="166" REF="233">
of a blew colour. The other Whale-bone is of
a brown colour, and dark browni&s;h with yellow
&s;troaks, which are e&s;teemed to be the olde&s;t:
The blew Whale-bone cometh from young
Whales and Finn fi&s;hes. He is not as black as
Velvet, as the Whale is, but like a Tench.
The &s;hape of his Body is long and &s;mall, nei|ther
is he &s;o fat as a Whale, wherefore we do
not much care to catch him for he doth not
pay us for our Labour. It is much more dan|gerous
to kill him than to kill a Whale, be|cau&s;e
he moves quicker, and beats about him
with his Tail, and from him with his Finns, &s;o
that we dare not come near unto him with our
Sloops or Long-boats, for the Launces kill him
&s;oone&s;t. I was informed, that once &s;ome, be|fore
they were aware of it, did fling, by a mi|&s;take,
their Harpoon into a Finn-fi&s;h, where|upon
he drew both Boat and Men, all on a &s;udden,
underneath a large Ice-&s;heet before they
were aware of it, and not one of them e&s;cap'd.
His Tail lies flat, like unto that of the Whale.
When the&s;e Finn-fi&s;hes appear we &s;ee no more
Whales.</P>
<P>The Train-oyl of the Whale is u&s;ed by &s;eve|ral,
<HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Frize-makers, Curriers, Cloath|workers,</HI>
and <HI>Soap-boilers;</HI> but the greate&s;t u&s;e
that is made of it, is to burn it in Lamps in&s;tead
of other Oyl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greenland</HI> Ships carry 30 or 40 Men, and
&s;ometimes more, chiefly the great Ships, that
have &s;ix Sloops belonging to them, &s;uch Ships
hold from 800 to 1000 Cardels of Fat; the
le&s;s. Ships have commonly fewer Cardels or
Ve&s;&s;els, from 400 to 700, and have commonly
<HI>five</HI> Sloops or Boats belonging to them. There
al&s;o go Galliots to <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> to catch Whales;
<PB N="167" REF="233">
they have three or four Sloops belonging to
them: Some put the Sloops upon the Deck of
the Ships, others hang them overboard, as they
do at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> when they are among&s;t the
Ice, that as &s;oon as they call <HI>Fall, fall,</HI> they
may immediately let down their Sloops into
the Water.</P>
<P>Then there remains onboard in the Ships the
Steer&s;man, the Barber, the Chyrurgion, the
Cooper, and a Boy, to look after the Ship;
the Skipper or Commander him&s;elf goeth out
with the re&s;t of the Men, for they are all obli|ged
to go a Whale catching.</P>
<P>In each Ship there are &s;ixty Launces, &s;ix
Sea-hor&s;e Launces, forty Harpoons, ten long
Harpoons wherewith they &s;trike the <HI>Whales</HI>
under Water, &s;ix &s;mall Sea-hor&s;e Harpoons,
thirty Lines or Ropes, and each of them is
about eighty or ninety fathoms long. When
they go a hunting they take along with them
into each Sloop two, and &s;ometimes three Har|poons,
&s;ix Launces, two or three Sea-hor&s;e
Launces, three Lines, and five or &s;ix Men, ac|cording
to the bigne&s;s of the Sloops, therein is
the Harpoonier, Line-keeper or Giver, and the
Steer&s;man: They all row equally, until they
come near to the <HI>Whale,</HI> except the Steer&s;man,
for he guides the Boat with his Rudder. They
al&s;o have in each Sloop a Chopping-knife, to
cut off the Rope when they cannot follow the
<HI>Whale,</HI> and a Hammer, and other In&s;truments,
as Hatchets, Drags, and &s;everal &s;orts of Knives,
wherewithal they cut the <HI>Whales.</HI> Meat and
Drink is al&s;o given them according to the u&s;ual
Cu&s;tom, he that will have better mu&s;t take it
along with him. Lazy Fellows are in this
Voyage troubled with the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> but tho&s;e
<PB N="168" REF="234">
that fear neither Air nor Wind, and be&s;tir
them&s;elves, e&s;cape pretty well; el&s;e the <HI>Scurvy</HI>
is the common Di&s;temper in this Voyage, be|&s;ides
Feavers, Impo&s;thumes, and other acciden|tal

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of ROtz-fi&s;hes and Sea-qualms.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rotz-fi&s;h</HI> (or <HI>Slime-fi&s;hes)</HI> I call the&s;e, that
in them&s;elves are nothing el&s;e but Slime,
and they are tran&s;parent. I have ob&s;erved &s;e|veral

like Finns, as that &s;ame which I call the <HI>Sea
May-flye.</HI> Others are like unto the flat Snails,
only in&s;tead of Finns they have Stalks like un|to

other &s;orts, that are quite differing in &s;hape
from the others, and are called <HI>Sea-qualms</HI> by
the Seamen, as if they were a thick Scum of the
Sea coagulated together. They are al&s;o called
after the Latin Name <HI>Sea-nettles,</HI> becau&s;e they
cau&s;e a burning Pain like unto Nettles. I have
formerly had &s;ome Thoughts, that the <HI>Rotz</HI> or
<HI>Slime fi&s;hes</HI> might be a Seed flung out and &s;o pu|trefied,
and that they did cau&s;e this burning
Pain by rea&s;on of their putrefaction; and &s;o I did
think that they received their &s;hape or form

<PB N="169" REF="234">
<HI>Thornbacks,</HI> others after <HI>Whales,</HI> and the like;
but this doth not &s;eem to be agreeable to Rea|&s;on,
for I have con&s;idered it better &s;ince, and
find Life to be a far more boble thing, than that
it &s;hould proceed from putrefied Seed ca&s;t away.
They clean&s;e the Sea mightily, for all the filth
and uncleanne&s;e &s;ticks to them, ju&s;t as a Burr

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of the Sea-May-flye.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e &s;mall Fi&s;h are very like unto the <HI>Sea-nettles,</HI>
becau&s;e of their tran&s;parent Body, and
they al&s;o di&s;&s;olve like the &s;ame, if you hold them
in your hand. They have two Finns under|neath,
about the Neck, which are like&s;t unto
tho&s;e of the <HI>Whale.</HI> They are in their &s;hape
like unto our white Rowls, broad and thick in
the middle, and thin and pointed at each end.
As for the re&s;t of the Body, it is very like unto
our <HI>May-flye,</HI> &s;ave only that the Tail or Body is
all along thicker, and only begins to be pointed
towards the end. The Head is broad and
round, &s;plit in the middle; it hath &s;mall horns
about the breadth of a Straw; on his Head be|fore
it hath two rows of &s;ix red little Knobs,
three of them in each row; whether they be
Eyes or no I cannot exactly tell. Its Mouth is
divided or &s;plit. From his Mouth down into
his Belly are its Guts, which one may ea&s;ily &s;ee
becau&s;e of its tran&s;parency. It is of yellow
and black colour; but the colour of the whole
Fi&s;h is like unto the White of an Egg. He
moves in the Water ju&s;t like a <HI>Sea-nettle.</HI> I have
drawn him here in his proper bigne&s;s. I am of
opinion, that the Birds feed upon them, be|cau&s;e
the <HI>Lumbs, Pigeon-divers,</HI> and <HI>Parret-divers,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="235">
are plentifully &s;een in tho&s;e places where

that out of the utmo&s;t part of him come two
Stalks, like unto the Beam of a pair of Scales,
hairy or rough on each &s;ide, like unto a Feather.
With the&s;e Stalks he moves him&s;elf up and
down like the <HI>Sea-nettle.</HI> They are of a brown
colour: They &s;wim in great numbers in the
Sea, as numerous as the Du&s;t in the Sun. It is

Food for the <HI>Whales,</HI> as to make them &s;o fat; I
rather believe that the <HI>Lumbs, Pigeon-divers,</HI> and

this Plate is another &s;mall Circle, and from the

begin. It is hollow within, which Cavity
may perhaps be his Belly, wherein I found
two or three of the &s;mall Shrimps. Round
about did hang down &s;even brown &s;mall

Nails, with which they climb the Ice; and as
large as a great Ox, having a great &s;emicircular
Tusk growing on each &s;ide of their upper Jaw,
which are very much valued, e&s;pecially by the
Northern People, partly for their u&s;es in Medi|cines,
as to make Cramp-rings, (which they
make al&s;o of the Bri&s;tles upon his Cheeks) to
re&s;i&s;t Poi&s;on, and other malignant Di&s;ea&s;es,
wherein they are at lea&s;t equal to that called
the Unicorn's Horn; but more for their Beau|try,
which is equal to, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Ivory.
The heavine&s;s of it makes it much &s;ought after
for Handles of Swords. Their Skins, being
dre&s;&s;ed, are thicker than two Ox-hides, yet
light, and excellent to make Targets again&s;t
Darts and Arrows of the Savages. They feed
upon Fi&s;h and Herbs, and &s;leep, if there be Ice,
upon that; where if &s;urprized, the female ca&s;ts
her young ones (of which &s;he hath commonly
two at a time) into the Sea, and her &s;elf after
them, &s;wimming away with them in her Arms;

returning many times to &s;et upon the Boat, in|to

Water, they all ari&s;e up together, and with their
weight and force falling upon the Ice, endea|vour
to break it; as they did when &s;urprized
by <HI>Jonas Pool</HI> 1610, where him&s;elf and divers
of his Men e&s;caped drowning very narrowly;
one of them being in the Sea, the Mor&s;&s;es &s;et
upon him with their Teeth, but with very great
labour and hazard of his company he e&s;caped
Death, though &s;ore wounded. Frequently al&s;o
they &s;leep on the &s;hore, and if they have con|venience,
upon an high and &s;teep place. They
always go in great companies, and &s;et one to
<PB N="184" REF="242">
keep watch; which if &s;urprized a&s;leep, 'tis an
ea&s;ie matter to kill all the re&s;t; but if he give
warning by grunting, they clap their hinder
Feet under their two Tusks, and &s;o roll into
the Sea. But if they be caught on plain ground,
yet are they hardly &s;lain, being both &s;trong and
fierce, and all ha&s;ting one way to the Water.
The <HI>Dutch</HI> at fir&s;t were very much troubled to
kill them, their Shot the Bea&s;t valued not much,
their Hatchets and Half-pikes would not pierce
them; nor did they think they could be killed,
except &s;truck with great force in the mid&s;t of
the Forehead. The fir&s;t time they &s;et upon
them, of 200 they could not kill one, but went
for their Ordnance to &s;hoot them. Our Men,
after a little experience, found the way to di|&s;patch
them with Javelins, as is before rehear&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some imagine this to be <HI>John Mayen's I&s;land,</HI>

<HEAD>JOHN MAYEN's I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JObn Mayen's I&s;land,</HI> &s;o called from the name of
the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer, (as the <HI>Dutch</HI> pretend)
&s;eems by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to be called <HI>Hope-I&s;land,</HI> or
if not, I know not whether the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have
been upon it. It &s;eems not to be of any great
con&s;equence, all that is &s;poken of it being that
it extends in length from South-we&s;t to North-ea&s;t
The farther it &s;hoots out in length, the
more contracted and narrower it grows in
breadth; &s;o that in the middle the di&s;tance is
very &s;mall between both Shores. Before the
Whale-fi&s;hing was removed to <HI>Greenland,</HI> in the
Summer-time this I&s;land was much frequented
by the Seamen whom Trade invited thither;
and the I&s;land was well known to mo&s;t of the
Northern Adventurers of <HI>Europe;</HI> but &s;ince the
Whales have de&s;erted tho&s;e Shores, and have
removed their Sea-quarters farther to the North,
the Seamen and Fi&s;hermen have been forced to
follow their Prey to <HI>Greenland.</HI> For it &s;eems the
Whales, either weary of the place, or &s;en&s;ible
of their own danger, do often change their Har|bours.
In the Spring time the we&s;tern &s;ide of
the I&s;land is not &s;o much enclo&s;ed with Ice, as
that which lies in the North, where it runs out
into the Sea, with a &s;harp point behind the <HI>Moun|tain
of Bears;</HI> for on this &s;ide, all the year long,
the Ice never removes from the Shore, above
ten miles; and in the Spring time &s;o be&s;ieges it,
that there is no pa&s;&s;age through it. For which
rea&s;on the Mariners, who are bound for this
I&s;land, u&s;e all the care they can to avoid the
<PB N="186" REF="243">
Ea&s;tern, and to make directly to the We&s;tern
Shore, there to lye while the Fi&s;hing-&s;ea&s;on con|tinues;
if by mi&s;carriage they come upon the
Ea&s;t-&s;ide, they are then forced to fetch a com|pa&s;s
about the North part of the I&s;land, where|by
they are not only expo&s;ed to the terrible winds
that blow off from <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI> but al&s;o to
the dangers of the floating Ice: for here the Sea
flows from South to North, and ebbs from North
to South. At the Northern end of the I&s;land
appears the <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI> of a prodigious
height, and &s;o perpendicularly &s;teep, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to climb to the top of it. This
Mountain, from the Bears there frequently &s;een,
called <HI>Beerenberg</HI> or the <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI> at the
bottom takes up the whole &s;pace beween the
Ea&s;tern and the We&s;tern Shore; on the North
&s;ide it leaves a little room for leveller ground
to the Ocean; and being of prodigious height,
may be de&s;cryed 30 miles off at Sea.</P>
<P>The Sea-coa&s;t lies thus: 1. <HI>Noords-hoeck,</HI> or
the <HI>Northern Angle,</HI> is the extream point &s;hooting
out to the North. 2. <HI>Oo&s;thoeck</HI> is the mo&s;t
Ea&s;tern point. <HI>Ysbergh,</HI> mark'd 1, 2, 3, are three
Mountains of Ice, or rather va&s;t heaps of con|gealed
Snow, which di&s;&s;olved by the heat of
the Sun, falls from the top of <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI>
but upon the Sun's retiring freezes again.
3. <HI>Zuydoo&s;t-hoeck</HI> is the South-ea&s;t Angle. From
this point the Shore extends it&s;elf from Ea&s;t to
We&s;t to a little I&s;land, and then winds again to
the We&s;t and South; in &s;ome places not pa&s;&s;a|ble

enough. 4. <HI>Cleyn Sand-bay</HI> or <HI>Little Sand-bay,

give them liberty enough, &s;o as they prevented
their e&s;cape. No Nece&s;&s;ary or Convenience
was wanting; their Food &s;uch as they could eat,
Milk, Butter, Chee&s;e, Fle&s;h, and Fi&s;h, but raw.
They could eat no Bread, nor boil'd Meat, but
nothing &s;o much abhorr'd by them as Wine, or
Brandy. Their plea&s;ante&s;t Beuvrage was Train-Oyl.
But whatever was done to, or for them,

Chagrin which they continually lived in for
the want of their beloved Country. They

from <HI>Spain,</HI> the King was plea&s;ed to &s;hew him
tho&s;e Savages, and their dexterity in rowing,
which was by all the Spectators admired. The

<PB N="197" REF="249">
al&s;o to the King, and de&s;ired to &s;erve him; but
this fervor was quickly decay'd, and the poor
man returned to his &s;adne&s;s and complaints.
Some of them endeavoured to get to Sea in their
little Boats, but being retrieved, dyed of Me|lancholy.
Two lived divers years at <HI>Koldingen</HI>
in <HI>Jutland,</HI> where they were employ'd in diving
for Pearl-Mu&s;cles; in which their skill and
dexterity was &s;uch, that every one that &s;aw them
believed they had practi&s;ed the &s;ame employ|ment

had, that the Governour promi&s;ed him&s;elf great
Profit thereby; and that in a &s;hort time he
&s;hould &s;ell Pearls by the quart, if they continued.
But his Covetou&s;ne&s;s de&s;troyed his Gain; for
not content with what they fi&s;hed in Summer,
he al&s;o compelled them under the Ice in Win|ter
time; where one of them fell into &s;uch a
Di&s;ea&s;e, from the cold &s;o contracted, that he
dyed. After who&s;e death the other never en|joyed
him&s;elf; but finding an opportunity, he
got his little Boat, and before he was overtaken
got to the main Sea. But being brought back,
they repre&s;ented to him the impo&s;&s;ibility of his

any opportunity of fulfilling their De&s;ires;
they would &s;teal when they &s;aw the Mariners

if they could. Yet are they apprehen&s;ive
enough, and quickly conceive yours, and ex|pre&s;s
their own meaning. If they had not seen
what was asked them, they winked, or cover'd
their Eyes; if they under&s;tood not, &s;topt their
Ears, and the like. They delight exceedingly
in Mu&s;ick, to which they would keep time both
with their voice, hands, and feet: wonderful
al&s;o affectionate one to another, and to their
Country. In one Voyage there went a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI>

as &s;oon as they &s;aw him, they came
about him, ki&s;&s;ed him, hung upon him, and
&s;hewed to him all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;trations of
Kindne&s;s and Affection. And tho&s;e who were
in <HI>Denmark</HI> never enjoy'd them&s;elves, nor had
any content, but continually pined away, and
langui&s;h'd with Di&s;content for their condition,
and love of their country. Their Religion,
&s;uch as it is, &s;eems to be unto the Sun; for
when our People invited them to conver&s;ation,
bartering, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they held up their hands towards
the Sun, and cried <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">otan;</HI> nor would they

cloven feet, <HI>&amp;c</HI> very ill made; Altars al&s;o and
quantities of Bones of Bea&s;ts, as of Deer, Foxes,
Dogs, and the like, near unto them. They
&s;eem al&s;o, as all Idolaters, given to Enchant|ments
and Sorceries. Our men have &s;een them
lying flat upon the Earth, and muttering their
Prayers or Charms into the Ground, wor&s;hip|ing
the Devil, who&s;e proper habitation they
<PB N="203" REF="252">
conceive to be under them. In &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es
they tye a &s;tick to a great &s;tone, to which they
pay their Devotions; and if they can lift it up
ea&s;ily and lightly, they think their Prayers are
heard, and Recovery granted. In Winter they
retire from the Sea &s;ide, unto the warmer Val|leys,
where they have their Hou&s;es and Towns,
which are commonly Caves at the foot of an
hill, round like an Oven, clo&s;e to one another,
and pa&s;&s;age in the inner parts from one to ano|ther;
their Doors, which are low and round,
open to the &s;outh; and they dig trenches al&s;o
to draw away the water that falls or drains from
the hill. The entrance, and &s;ome part of their
hou&s;e, &s;tands without the cave, which they
frame very hand&s;omly and commodiou&s;ly of
the ribs of Whales join'd artificially at the top,
and cover'd with Seals skins. They rai&s;e al&s;o
one part of their floor higher than another,
which they &s;trow with mo&s;s to &s;leep upon. But
in their fi&s;hing-time they have Tents, which
they remove from place to place in their larger
Boats. They &s;et up four Poles, and cover them
with Skins, which &s;erves very well in &s;ummer:
when fi&s;hing is done, they return with them to
their Hou&s;es. Their manner of bartering, is
to make two heaps, one of &s;uch things as they
de&s;ire, the other of what they would part with;
and they cea&s;e not to take away from the one
or other, till the Trade is ballanced. The
chiefe&s;t things of our which they valued&punc; were
Knives, Needles, little pieces of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oon, Looking
gla&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the&s;e they would &s;ell their; B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wg
and Arrows; their Boaid, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rip bhem?&s;ewes of
their Clothes, but never, like &s;ome other Barba|rians,
&s;ell their Wives and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="253">
Their clothing is either of Birds-skins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cloa|thing.</NOTE> with
the Feathers and Down upon them, or Seals,
Dogfi&s;h, or the like. Seals they u&s;e mo&s;t in their
fi&s;hing, becau&s;e that fi&s;h there abounds, and are
ea&s;ily deceived, by &s;eeing one clad&punc; in their own
Livery: be&s;ides, that the&s;e kind of Furs are
not &s;o apt to be wet, though dip'd in Water.
They wear the hair &s;ides outward in &s;ummer,
inward in winter, and in great colds carry two
or more &s;uits one upon another. They dre&s;s
their Skins very well, making them dry, &s;oft,
and durable, and &s;ow them al&s;o very &s;trong with
Sinews of Bea&s;ts, and Needles made of Fi&s;h|bones.</P>
<P>But in nothing do they &s;hew &s;o much Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Boats</NOTE>
as in their Boats or Canoes. They are made
of that we call Whalebone, about in inch thick
and broad, and the&s;e not &s;et like ribs, but all
along from prow to poop, fa&s;t &s;owed to one
another with &s;trong Sinews, and covered over
with Seals-skin. They are from ten to twenty
foot long, and about two foot broad, made like
a Weaver's Shutle, &s;harp at both ends, &s;o that
he can row either way; and in making this
pointedne&s;s they are of all things mo&s;t curious,
for therein con&s;i&s;ts the &s;trength of their Ve&s;&s;el.
In the middle of it are the ribs, both to keep
the &s;ides a&s;under, and to make the hole in the
covering, wherein the Rower &s;its. They have
a deck made of the &s;ame materials, which is
clo&s;ely fa&s;ten'd to the &s;ides, in the mid&s;t where|of
is a round hole, as big as the middle of a
Man; &s;o that when he goes to Sea, he &s;ets
himself in that hole, &s;tretching out his feet for+ward
<PB N="205" REF="253">
into the hollow of the Boat; he &s;tops up
the hole &s;o clo&s;e with his frock, or loo&s;e upper
garment, that no water can enter, tho' it were
in the bottom of the Sea. His frock is &s;trait
tyed at the hand-wri&s;ts, and to his neck, and
his capouch &s;owed al&s;o clo&s;e to it; &s;o that if
the Boat be overturned or overwhelmed in the
Sea, he ri&s;es up again, without any wet either
upon his Skin or in his Boat. They have but
one Oar, which is about &s;ix foot long, with a
paddle &s;ix inches broad at either end; this
&s;erves him both to ballance his Boat and move
it; which he doth with that incredible &s;celeri|ty,
that one of our Boats with ten Oars is not
able to keep company with them: The <HI>Dani&s;h</HI>
relation &s;aith, that they rowed &s;o &s;wift, that
they even dazled the Eyes of the Spectators;
and tho' they cro&s;&s;ed frequently, yet never in|terfered
or hit one another.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;hing ordinarily is darting;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fi&s;h|ing.</NOTE> their darts
are long, &s;trongly barbed, and at the other end
have Bladders fa&s;tened to them, that when they
have &s;truck the Fi&s;h, he may &s;pend him&s;elf with
&s;trugling to get under water, which yet he can|not
do, and &s;o is ea&s;ily taken.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, they have greater Boats for the
removing their Tents and other Utensils, as al&s;o
to carry their Fi&s;h they have caught to their
Hou&s;es; the&s;e are thirty and forty foot long,
and have &s;ometimes ten, and &s;ometimes more
&s;eats for Rowers. Cardinal <HI>Bembus</HI> (in his <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
Hi&s;tory) &s;aith, that in his time one of
the&s;e, with &s;even Per&s;ons in it, was by &s;torm ca&s;t
upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Britany.</HI> I know not whether
<PB N="206" REF="254">
it be worth mentioning, that they have Kettles
and Pans made of Stone (&s;ome &s;ay of Load|&s;tone)
that endures the fire wonderfully, but
not having tools fit to hollow them &s;ufficiently,
they make up the edges of Whalebone.</P>

FRISELAND,</HEAD>
<P>LIeth in 60 deg. more we&s;terly than any part
of <HI>Europe:</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>I&s;eland</HI> leagues.
It is reported in bigne&s;s not to be much le&s;&s;er
than <HI>England;</HI> a ragged and high land, the
mountains cover'd with &s;now, and the coa&s;t &s;o
full of drift Ice, that it is almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It was fir&s;t di&s;covered to us by <HI>Nicolao</HI> and
<HI>Antonio Zani,</HI> two <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Di&s;co|veries.</NOTE> that were
here &s;hipwrack'd. They de&s;cribe the Inhabi|tants
to be good Chri&s;tians, very civil, and to
be governed by a great Lord who&s;e Name was
<HI>Zichmay,</HI> who&s;e mighty conque&s;ts, and &s;trange
accidents may be read in <HI>Hackluit.</HI> It is not
our bu&s;ine&s;s to write or repeat Romances.
Tho&s;e men whom our Seamen (touching there
accidently) &s;aw, were like in all things to the
<HI>Gronelanders,</HI> both in features of body, and man|ner
of living, as much as they could judge; &s;o
like, that many of them thought it continued to
<HI>Groneland;</HI> in which opinion al&s;o they were
confirm'd by the multitudes of the I&s;lands of ice,
<PB N="207" REF="254">
which coming from the north, argued land to
be that way: for many of our Mariners hold,
that &s;alt water doth not freeze, but that all the
Ice they find in the Sea comes from the Bays,
and mouths of fre&s;h-water Rivers; for the ice
it &s;elf is &s;weet and fre&s;h, being di&s;&s;olved, and
&s;erves to all purpo&s;es, as well as Spring or River
water. Be&s;ides, the &s;alt Sea (they &s;ay) is always
in motion, and &s;o cannot freeze. But the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who winter'd in <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> took notice, that
the &s;alt water freez'd, and that two inches thick
in one night.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be good fi&s;hing every
where upon the coa&s;t. In their &s;oundings they
brought up a &s;ort of pale Coral, and little Stones
clear as Cry&s;tal. They call'd it <HI>We&s;t England,</HI>
and one of the highe&s;t mountains they called
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s.</HI></P>
