WITH ALL WELL-WILLERS,

Grace and Peace, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_NEW ENGLAND,
&s;o call'd, not onely (to
auoyd nouelties) becau&s;e
Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> hath &s;o
entituled it in his De&s;crip|tion,
but becau&s;e of the re|&s;emblance
that is in it, of
England the natiue &s;oile of
Engli&s;h-men; It being
much what the &s;ame for
heate and colde in Summer and Winter, it being
Champion ground, but not high mountaines, &s;omwhat
like the &s;oile in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> full of Dales, and med|dow
ground, full of ryuers and &s;weete &s;prings, as Eng|land
is. But principally, &s;o farre as we can yet find, it is
an Iland, and neere about the quantitie of England, be|ing
cut off from the maine land of <HI>America,</HI> as England
is from the maine of <HI>Europe,</HI> by a great arme of the Sea,
which entreth in fortie degrees, and runneth vp North
we&s;t and by We&s;t, and goeth out either into the South
<PB REF="3">
Sea, or el&s;e into the Bay of <HI>Canado.</HI> The certaintie
whereof, and &s;ecrets of which, we haue not yet &s;o found
as that as eye-witne&s;&s;es we can make narration thereof,
but if God giue time and meanes, we &s;hall ere long, di&s;|couer
both the extent of that Riuer, together with the
&s;ecrets thereof; and al&s;o try what territories, habitations,
or commodities, may be found, either in it, or about
it.</P>
<P>It pertaineth not to my purpo&s;e to &s;peake any thing,
either in pray&s;e, or di&s;pray&s;e of the country, &s;o it is by
Gods prouidence, that a few of vs are there planted to
our content, and haue with great charge and difficultie
attained quiet and competent dwellings there. And
thus much I will &s;ay for the &s;atisfaction of &s;uch as haue
any thought of going thither to inhabit; That for men
which haue a large heart, &amp; looke after great riches, ea&s;e,
plea&s;ure, dainties, and iollitie in this world (except they
will liue by other mens &s;weat, or haue great riches) I
would not adui&s;e them to come there, for as yet the
country will afford no &s;uch matters: But if there be any,
who are content to lay out their e&s;tates, &s;pend their time,
labours, and endeuours, for the benefit of them that
&s;hall come after, and in de&s;ire to further the Go&s;pell a|mong
tho&s;e poore Heathens, quietly contenting them|&s;elues
with &s;uch hard&s;hip and difficulties, as by Gods
prouidence &s;hall fall vpon them, being yet yong, and in
their &s;trength, &s;uch men I would adui&s;e and encourage
to goe, for their ends cannot faile them.</P>
<P>And if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to puni&s;h his people in
the Chri&s;tian countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> (for their coldne&s;&s;e,
carnality, wanton abu&s;e of the Go&s;pel, contention, &amp;c.)
either by Turki&s;h &s;lauery, or by Popi&s;h tyrannie, which
God forbid, yet if the time be come, or &s;hall come (as
who knoweth) when Sathan &s;hall be let loo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 12. 14. 15</NOTE> to ca&s;t
out his flouds again&s;t them, here is a way opened for
&s;uch as haue wings to flie into this Wilderne&s;&s;e; and as
<PB REF="3">
by the di&s;per&s;ion of the Iewi&s;h Church thorow per|&s;ecution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 11. 20. 21.</NOTE>
the Lord brought in the fulne&s;&s;e of the Gen|tiles,
&s;o who knoweth, whether now by tyrannie, and
affliction, which he &s;uffereth to come vpon them, he
will not by little and little cha&s;e them, even among&s;t
the Heathens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 2. 32.</NOTE> that &s;o a light may ri&s;e vp in the darke,
and the kingdome of heauen be taken from them which
now haue it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 21. 43.</NOTE> and giuen to a people that &s;hall bring forth
the fruit of it. This I leaue to the iudgement of the god|ly
wi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 7. 14.</NOTE> being neither Prophet nor &s;onne of a Prophet,
but con&s;idering Gods dealing of olde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 23.</NOTE> and &s;eeing the
name of Chri&s;tian to be very great, but the true nature
thereof almo&s;t quite lo&s;t in all degrees &amp; &s;ects, I cannot
thinke but that there is &s;ome iudgement not farre off,
and that God will &s;hortly, euen of &s;tones, ray&s;e vp chil|dren
vnto <HI>Abraham.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 3. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>And who &s;o rightly con&s;idereth, what manner of
entrance, abiding, and proceedings, we haue had a|mong&s;t
the&s;e poore Heathens &s;ince we came hither, will
ea&s;ily thinke, that God hath &s;ome great worke to doe
towards them.</P>
<P>They were wont to be the mo&s;t cruelle&s;t and treche|rou&s;e&s;t
people in all the&s;e parts, euen like Lyons, but to
vs they haue beene like Lambes, &s;o kinde, &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;iue,
and tru&s;tie, as a man may truely &s;ay many Chri&s;tians are
not &s;o kinde, nor &s;incere.</P>
<P>They are very much wa&s;ted of late, by rea&s;on of a
great mortalitie that fell among&s;t them three yeares
&s;ince, which together with their owne ciuill di&s;&s;en&s;ions
and blouddie warres, hath &s;o wa&s;ted them, as I thinke
the twentith per&s;on is &s;carce left aliue, and tho&s;e that are
left, haue their courage much abated, and their counte|nance
is deiected, and they &s;eeme as a people affrighted.
And though when we came fir&s;t into the countrie, we
were few, and many of vs were &s;icke, and many dyed
by rea&s;on of the colde and wet, it being the depth of
<PB REF="4">
winter, and we hauing no hou&s;es, nor &s;helter, yet when
there was not &s;ixe able per&s;ons among&s;t vs, and that
they came daily to vs by hundreths, with their <HI>Sachems,</HI>
or <HI>Kings,</HI> and might in one houre haue made a di&s;patch
of vs yet &s;uch a feare was vpon them, as that they ne|uer
offred vs the lea&s;t iniury in word or deede. And by
rea&s;on of one <HI>Ti&s;quanto,</HI> that liues among&s;t vs, that can
&s;peake Engli&s;h, we haue daily commerce with their
<HI>Kings,</HI> &amp; can know what is done or intended towards
vs among&s;t the Savages; Al&s;o we can acquaint them
with our cour&s;es and purpo&s;es, both humane and reli|gious.
And the greate&s;t Commander of the countrie
call'd <HI>Ma&s;&s;a&s;oit,</HI> commeth often to vi&s;ite vs, though hee
liue fiftie myles from vs, and often &s;ends vs pre&s;ents,
he hauing with many other of their gouernours promi|&s;ed,
yea, &s;ub&s;cribed obedience to our Soueraigne Lord
King IAMES, and for his cau&s;e to &s;pend both &s;trength
and life. And we for our parts, thorow Gods grace,
haue with that equitie, ju&s;tice, and compa&s;&s;ion, carried
our &s;elues towards them, as that they haue receiued
much fauour, helpe, and ayde from vs, but neuer the
lea&s;t iniury, or wrong by vs. Wee found the place
where we liue emptie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They offer vs to dwell where we will.</NOTE> the people being all dead &amp; gone
away, and none liuing neere by 8. or 10. myles; and
and though in the time of &s;ome hard&s;hip wee found
(trauelling abroad) &s;ome 8. Bu&s;hels of Corne hid vp
in a Caue, and knew no owners of it, yet afterward
hearing of the owners of it, we gaue them (in their e|&s;timation)
double the value of it. Our care al&s;o hath
beene to maintaine peace among&s;t them, and haue al|wayes
&s;et our &s;elues again&s;t &s;uch of them as v&s;ed any re|bellion,
or trecherie again&s;t their gouernours, and not
onely threatned &s;uch, but in &s;ome &s;ort payd them their
due de&s;erts; and when any of them are in want, as often
they are in the Winter, when their corne is done, wee
&s;upply them to our power, and haue them in our hou&s;es
<PB REF="4">
eating and drinking, and warming them&s;elues, which
thing (though it be &s;omething a trouble to vs) ye be|cau&s;e
they &s;hould &s;ee and take knowledge of our la|bours,
orders, and diligence, both for this life and a
better, we are content to beare it, and we find in many
of them, e&s;pecially, of the younger &s;ort, &s;uch a tracta|ble
di&s;po&s;ition, both to Religion and humanitie, as that
if we had meanes to apparell them, &amp; wholly to retaine
them with vs (as their de&s;ire is) they would doubtle&s;&s;e
in time proue &s;eruiceable to God and man, and if euer
God &s;end vs meanes we will bring vp hundreths of their
children, both to labour and learning.</P>
<P>But leauing to &s;peake of them till a further occa&s;ion
be offered; If any &s;hall maruell at the publi&s;hing of this
Treati&s;e in England, &s;eeing there is no want of good
bookes, but rather want of men to v&s;e good bookes,
let them know, that the e&s;peciall end is, that wee may <MILESTONE N="1">
keepe tho&s;e motiues in memory for our &s;elues, &amp; tho&s;e
that &s;hall come after, to be a remedie again&s;t &s;elfe-loue
the bane of all &s;ocieties. And that al&s;o we might te&s;ti|fie <MILESTONE N="2">
to our Chri&s;tian Country-men, who iudge diuer&s;ly
of vs, that though we be in a Heathen Country, yet the
grace of Chri&s;t is not quenched in vs, but we &s;till hold,
and teach the &s;ame points of faith, mortification, and
&s;anctification, which we haue heard and learned in a
mo&s;t ample and large maner in our owne country. If
any &s;hall thinke it too rude and vnlearned for this curi|ous
age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 2. 4.</NOTE> let them know, that to paint out the Go&s;pell in
plaine and flat Engli&s;h, among&s;t a company of plaine
Engli&s;h-men (as we are) is the be&s;t and mo&s;t profita|ble&s;t
teaching; and we will &s;tudy plainne&s;&s;e, not curio|&s;itie,
neither in things humaine, nor heauenly. If any
error, or vn&s;oundne&s;&s;e be in it, (as who knoweth) im|pute
it to that frayle man which endited it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 8. 2.</NOTE> which profe&s;|&s;eth
to know nothing as he ought to know it. I haue
not &s;et downe my name, partly becau&s;e I &s;eeke no
<PB REF="5">
name, and principally, becau&s;e I would haue nothing
e&s;teemed by names, for I &s;ee a number of euils to ari&s;e
thorow names, when the per&s;ons are either famous, or
infamous, and God and man is often iniured; if any
good or profit ari&s;e to thee in the receiuing of it, giue
God the pray&s;e, and e&s;teeme me as a &s;onne of <HI>Adam,</HI>
&s;ubiect to all &s;uch frailties as other men are.</P>
<P>And you my louing Friends the Aduenturers to this
plantation; as your care hath beene, fir&s;t to &s;ettle reli|gion
here, before either profit or popularitie, &s;o I pray
you, goe on, to doe it much more, and be carefull to
&s;end godly men, though they want &s;ome of that world|ly
policie which this world hath in her owne generati|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 16. 8.</NOTE>
and &s;o though you loo&s;e, the Lord &s;hall gayne. I
reioyce greatly in your free and readie mindes to your
powers, yea, and beyond your powers to further this
worke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 3. 9.</NOTE> that you thus honour God with your riches,
and I tru&s;t you &s;hall be repayed againe double &amp; treble
in this world, yea, and the memory of this action &s;hall
neuer die, but aboue all adding vnto this (as I tru&s;t you
doe) like freene&s;&s;e in all other Gods &s;eruices, both at
home and abroad, you &s;hall finde a reward with GOD,
ten thou&s;and fold &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all that you can doe or
thinke, be not therefore di&s;couraged, for no labour is
lo&s;t, nor money &s;pent, which is be&s;towed for God,
your ends were good, your &s;ucce&s;&s;e is good, and your
profit is comming, euen in this life, and in the life to
come much more; And what &s;hall I &s;ay now, a word
to men of vnder&s;tanding &s;ufficeth, pardon I pray you
my boldne&s;&s;e, reade ouer the en&s;uing Treati&s;e, and
judge wi&s;ely of the poore weakling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 42. 1.</NOTE> and the Lord, the
God of Sea and Land, &s;tretch out his arme of protecti|on
ouer you and vs, and ouer all our lawfull and good
enterpri&s;es, either this, or any other way.</P>

<BIBL>1. Cor. 10. 24.</BIBL>
<Q>Let no man &s;eeke his owne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Text.</NOTE> But euery man ano|thers

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE occa&s;ion of the&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle
<HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The connexi|on.</NOTE> was becau&s;e of the abu&s;es which were in
the Church of <HI>Corinth.</HI> Which abu&s;es aro&s;e
cheifly thorow &s;welling pride, &s;elfe-loue and
conceitednes, for although this Church were
planted by <HI>Paul,</HI> and watred by <HI>Apollo,</HI> and
much increa&s;ed by the Lord; yet the &s;ower of
tares was not wanting to &s;tirre vp euill
workers and fle&s;hly minded hypocrites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 13. 25.</NOTE> vnder a &s;hew of godlines,
and with Angellike holine&s;&s;e in appearance to creepe in among&s;t
them to di&s;turbe their peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 4.</NOTE> trie their &s;oundne&s;&s;e, and proue their
con&s;tancie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 13.</NOTE> And this the Apo&s;tle complaines of very often: as
fir&s;t, in their carnall deui&s;ions, Chap. 1. then in their extolling
their eloquent teachers, and de&s;pi&s;ing <HI>Paul, Chap.</HI> 4. Then in
their offen&s;iue going to Law, before the heathen Iudges Chap. 6.
Then in eating things offered to Idols, to the de&s;troying of the
tender con&s;ciences of their Brethren, Chap. 8. Then in their in|&s;atiable
loue-fea&s;tes, in the time and place of their Church mee|tings,
the rich which could together feede to fulnes, de&s;pi&s;ing and
contemning the poore, that had not to lay it on as they had, Chap
11.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 13.</NOTE> Finally in both the Epi&s;tles, hee very often nippeth them
for their pride, and &s;elfe-loue, &s;traitne&s;&s;e and cen&s;oriou&s;hes, &s;o
that in the la&s;t Chapter hee willeth them againe and againe to
proue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE> trie and examine them&s;elues, to &s;ee whether Chri&s;t were

are many which &s;et &s;uch a face vppon Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 16.</NOTE> and haue their
mouthes full of great &s;welling words: as if they would euen blow

&s;ound remedie be thought of, which remedie is euen that which
our Sauiour teacheth the rich young gallant, and which <HI>Paul</HI>
heere pre&s;cribeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 19. 21.</NOTE> in willing them not to &s;eeke their owne, but e|uerie
man anothers wealth, which Phy&s;icke is as terrible to car|nall
profe&s;&s;ors, as ab&s;tinence from drinke is to a man that hath
the drop&s;ie: and it is a &s;ure note, that a man is &s;icke of this di&s;ea&s;e
of &s;elfe-loue, if this be grieuous to him, as appeareth in the man
whom Chri&s;t bid &s;ell that hee had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 22.</NOTE> and hee went away very &s;or|rowfull,
yet &s;urely this veine mu&s;t bee pricked, and this humor
let out, els it will &s;poyle all, it will infect both &s;oule and body, yea
and the contagion of it is &s;uch (as wee &s;hall &s;ee anone) as will euen
hazard the welfare of that &s;ocietie, where &s;elfe &s;eekers and &s;elfe
louers are.</P>
<P>As God then did direct this Apo&s;tle to lay downe this briefe
direction as a remedy for that euill in <HI>Corinth,</HI> &s;o you may thinke
it is by Gods &s;peciall providence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 10. 33.</NOTE> that I am now to &s;peake vnto
you from this text: and &s;ay in your hearts &s;urely &s;ome thing is
ami&s;&s;e this way: let vs know it and amend it.</P>
<P>The parts of this text are two.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diui&s;ion.</NOTE> 1. a <HI>Dehortation,</HI> 2. an <HI>Exhortati|on.</HI>
The Dehortation. <HI>Let no man &s;eeke his owne.</HI> The Exhortation
<HI>But euery man anothers wealth.</HI></P>
<P>In handling of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of hand|ling.</NOTE> I will fir&s;t, open the wordes. Secondly,
gather the Doctrine. Thirdly, illu&s;trate the Doctrine by Scrip|tures,
experience and Rea&s;ons. Fourthly, apply the &s;ame, to euery
one his portion.</P>
<P>The proper drift of the Apo&s;tle heere is not to taxe the <HI>Corinthi|ans,</HI>
for &s;eeking their owne euill endes in euill actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apo&s;tles drift.</NOTE> but for
aiming at them&s;elues, and their owne benefits in actions lawfull,
and that appeareth in the former ver&s;e, where he &s;ayth. <HI>All things
are lawfull &amp;c.</HI> viz. all &s;uch thinges as now wee &s;peake of, to eate
any of Gods creatures, offered to Idols or not, to fea&s;t and bee
<PB N="3" REF="6">
merrie together, to &s;hew loue and kindne&s;&s;e to this or that per|&s;on,
&amp;c. but when by &s;uch meanes wee &s;eeke our &s;elues, and haue
not a charitable louing and reuerent regard of others, then they
are vnexpedient, vnprofitable, yea vnlawfull, and mu&s;t bee for|borne,
and hee that hath not learned to denie him&s;elfe euen the
very v&s;e of lawfull things, when it tendeth to the contempt, re|proch,
greife offence, and &s;hame of his other Brethren and A&s;&s;o|ciats,
hath learned nothing aright, but is apparantly a man that
&s;eekes him&s;elfe, and again&s;t whom the Apo&s;tle heere dealeth mo&s;t
properly.</P>
<P>The maner of the &s;peech may &s;eeme as coun&s;ell left at libertie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expo&s;ition.</NOTE>
as Mat. 27. 49. and in our ordinary &s;peech, wee thinke they be
but weake charges, which are thus deliuered, let a man doe this,
or let him doe that. But wee mu&s;t learne the Apo&s;tles mode&s;tie, and
know that what&s;oeuer the termes &s;eeme to imply, yet euen this
and other the like in this Epi&s;tle, are mo&s;t ab&s;olute charges: as
<HI>Let a man e&s;teeme of vs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 4. 1.</NOTE> <HI>as the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t,</HI> that is, a man ought
&s;o to e&s;teeme of vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Let a man examine him&s;elfe,</HI> that is, as if he &s;ayd
a man mu&s;t examine him&s;elfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Let your women keepe &s;ilence in the

<P>And indeede heere is the difference betweene a couetous world|ling,
and an hone&s;t thriftie Chri&s;tian, it is lawfull &s;ometimes for
men to gather wealth, and grow rich, euen as there was a time for
<HI>Io&s;eph</HI> to &s;tore vp corne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 41. 49.</NOTE> but a godly and &s;incere Chri&s;tian will &s;ee

field &s;et to &s;ale, gather as much as he can, but its death to dimini&s;h
the lea&s;t part of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> The &s;econd way by which men &s;eeke their owne, is when they
&s;eeke ea&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 11. 46.</NOTE> or plea&s;ure, as the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ies,</HI> who would not
touch the burthen with one of their fingers; so, there is a generati|on,
which thinke to haue more in this world then <HI>Adams</HI> felicitie
in Innocencie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 15.</NOTE> being borne (as they thinke) to take their plea&s;ures,
and their ea&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 10. 18.</NOTE> let the roofe of the hou&s;e drop thorow, they &s;tirre
not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 24. 30. 31.</NOTE> let the field be ouer-growne with weeds, they care not, they
mu&s;t not &s;oile their hand, nor wet their foote, its enough for them
to &s;ay, Goe you, not let vs goe, though neuer &s;o much need; &s;uch
idle Droanes are intollerable in a &s;etled Common-wealth, much
more in a Common-wealth which is but as it were in the bud; of
what earth I pray thee art thou made, of any better then other of
the &s;onnes of <HI>Adam?</HI> And can&s;t thou &s;ee other of thy brethren toile
their hearts out, and thou &s;it idle at home, or take&s;t thy plea&s;ure a|broad?
Remember the example of <HI>Vriah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 11. 11.</NOTE> who would not take his
ea&s;e, nor his plea&s;ure, though the King required him, and why?
Becau&s;e his brethren, his a&s;&s;ociates, better men then him&s;elfe (as he
e&s;teemed them) were vnder hard labours and conditions, lay in
the fields in tents, caues, &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> The third way is when men &s;eeke their owne bellies, as &s;ome did
in the Apo&s;tles times, which went about with new doctrines and
deuices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 26.</NOTE> knowing that the people had itching eares, and would ea|&s;ily
entertaine, and willingly feede &s;uch noueli&s;ts, which brought in
di&s;&s;en&s;ions, &s;chi&s;mes, and contentions, and &s;uch were rocks, or pil|lars
in their loue-fea&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 12.</NOTE> as <HI>Iude</HI> &s;peaketh, they were &s;haddowes in
Gods &s;eruice, but when fea&s;ting came, then they were &s;ub&s;tances,
then they were in their element. And certainely there are &s;ome men
which &s;hape euen their Religion, humaine &s;tate, and all, euen as the
belly cheare is be&s;t, and that they mu&s;t haue, els all heart and life is
gone, let all con&s;cience, care of others goe, let <HI>Lazarus</HI> &s;tarue at the
gate, let <HI>Io&s;ephs</HI> affliction be increa&s;ed, they mu&s;t haue their di&s;hes,
their dainties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 5. 14.</NOTE> or no content. The contrary was &s;eene in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI>
who would not take his large portion alotted to the gouernour,
becau&s;e he knew it went &s;hort with others of his brethren; and <HI>Vriah</HI>
would not receiue the Kings pre&s;ent and goe banquet with his wife,
becau&s;e he knew the whole Hoa&s;t his brethren were faine to &s;nap
&s;hort in the fields.</P>
<P>And the difference betweene a temperate good man, and a belly-God
is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 31. 17.</NOTE> A good man will not eate his mor&s;els alone, e&s;peci|ally
if he haue better then other, but if by Gods prouidence, he haue
<PB N="7" REF="8">
gotten &s;ome meate which is better then ordinary, and better then
his other brethrens, he can haue no re&s;t in him&s;elfe, except he make
other partaker with him. But a belly-God will &s;lop all in his owne
throat, yea, though his neighbour come in and behold him eate,
yet his griple gut &s;hameth not to &s;wallow all. And this may be done
&s;ometimes, as well in meane fare as in greater dainties, for all coun|tries
afford not alike.</P>
<P>The fourth way by which men &s;eeke their owne, is by &s;eeking <MILESTONE N="4">
outward honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 15. 30.</NOTE> fame, and re&s;pect with men, as King <HI>Saul</HI> when he
had lo&s;t all re&s;pect and fauour with God, then thought to giue con|tent
to his heart by being honoured before the Elders of the peo|ple;
and it is wonderfull to &s;ee how &s;ome men are <HI>de&s;irous of vaine
glory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 26.</NOTE> and how earne&s;tly they &s;eeke pray&s;e, fauour, and re&s;pect with
men, and can haue no quiet longer then their worldly fauour la|&s;teth,
and that they will haue what di&s;honour &s;oeuer come to God,
or di&s;grace vnto men, yea, they will di&s;grace, reproch, and di&s;daine
others, to gaine honour and aduancement to them&s;elues, yea, they
will make bold with the Scriptures and word of God, to wre&s;t and
wring, and &s;light it ouer for their credits &s;ake. And let a man marke
&s;ome mens talke, &s;tories, di&s;cour&s;es, &amp;c. and he &s;hall &s;ee their whole
drift is to extoll and &s;et out them&s;elues, and get prai&s;e and commen|dations
of men.</P>
<P>Now the contrary was &s;eene in <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 2.</NOTE> he &s;ayth, <HI>He needed no letters
of commendations.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 10. 12.</NOTE> And againe, <HI>He is not affected with mens pray&s;e;</HI>
and here is indeed the difference betweene an humble minded
Chri&s;tian, and a proud &s;elfe-louer; an humble man often hath
pray&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> as <HI>Dauid, Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Io&s;iah,</HI> but he &s;eekes it not, he de&s;ires
it not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 18. 3.</NOTE> he is content to goe without it, he loues not the pray&s;e of
men, for he knowes it is but froth and vanitie: But a proud &s;elfe-lo|uer,
he &s;eekes it &s;till, get it or not get it, and if he get it he is fully
&s;atisfied, if he get it not he hangs the head like a Bull-ru&s;h, and hath
no comfort.</P>
<P>The fift way by which men &s;eeke their owne, is by &s;eeking to haue <MILESTONE N="5">
their wils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6. 8.</NOTE> as the wrong doers in <HI>Corinth,</HI> who thought it not enough
to doe wrong and harme to their brethren, but to haue their wills
enough of them, drew them before the Heathen Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>And truely, &s;ome men are &s;o Prince-like, or rather Papall, that
their very will and word is become a law, and if they haue &s;aid it,
it mu&s;t be &s;o, els there is no re&s;t nor quietne&s;&s;e to be had, let neuer
&s;o many rea&s;ons be brought to the contrary, its but fighting with
the winde. They are like the ob&s;tinate <HI>Iewes,</HI> who, when again&s;t
Gods law &amp; rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 19.</NOTE> they had asked a King, though <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;hewed
them that it would turne in the end to their owne &s;mart, yet &s;till
held the conclu&s;ion, and &s;ayd, nay, <HI>But we will haue a King.</HI>
Thus men are caught by their owne words, and in&s;nared by the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;traitnes of their owne hearts, and it is death to them not to haue
their wils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 19. 2.</NOTE> and how&s;oeuer &s;ometimes (like <HI>Iezabell)</HI> they are cut
&s;hort of their purpo&s;es, yet &s;elfe-willed men will &s;trout and &s;well

though a Prince, a Captaine, a Warriour, who hauing &s;ayd, yea,

changed his minde, altered his purpo&s;e, and returned, without

when men are &s;icke of will, let them thinke of <HI>Dauid,</HI> it was his

rea&s;on came;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 14. 8. 9.</NOTE> So was it <HI>Herods</HI> di&s;grace and &s;hame to hold his word
