in poor, de&s;picable, and contemptible things. For an Arti&s;t is more to be e&s;teemed, that can perfectly make the Image of a Flie, then be that carveth out an Elephant; gro&s;s work re|quiring le&s;s skill then &s;ub|tile. So the Creator hath &s;hewed more wi&s;dome in the production of a Flie, then of an Elephant. Whence fol|loweth, That if one would undertake to con&s;ider the Makers Art in the forming of a Flie, and write a Trea|ti&s;e thereof; one might, per|haps, make, as the Pro|verb
<PB REF="11">
&s;aith, of a Flie an E|lephant; for Nature is mo&s;t Artificious and admirable in her least productions, &s;hewing mo&s;t my&s;tery there|in, Wherefore the wi&s;e&s;t of men, King <HI>Solomon,</HI> that di&s;|cour&s;ed of Trees from the Ce|dar of <HI>Libanon</HI> to the I&s;op growing by the way &s;ide; that &s;poke of Bea&s;ts and Birds, Reptils and Fi&s;hes; hath of none almo&s;t left us any do|ctrine, but of the little con|temptible Gnats; the exam|ple of good hou&s;e keeping con|&s;i&s;ting in the diligence and foreca&s;t, that is to be &s;een in

the&s;e poor little creatures; for having neither Prince Leader, nor Lord, they pro|vide their Bread in Summer, and gather their food in bar|ve&s;t. If any could intrude into their habitation, be would be astoni&s;hed to &s;ee how orderly their domicill is di|vided and fortified. Who can &s;ufficiently dive into the nature of the Bee? which hath given many matter e|nough to write of. The an|cient could not too much ad|mire the pro&s;it thereof, which they expre&s;&s;ed by this que&s;tion and Enigme: what is le&s;&s;er
<PB REF="12">
then a Mou&s;e, bigher then a Hou&s;e, and more profitable than a Country mans Ox? a Bee. Who can &s;ufficiently ad|mire that Master piece of Nature, the Spider? that not only can &s;o well according to the rules of Geometry, &s;pin and tye its Web to a Po&s;t, or the branch of a Tree; but al|&s;o can fa&s;ten it in the air, where there is no Ba&s;is. Thus it hath plea&s;ed God to &s;hew his power in infirmity, and depo&s;e the Trea&s;ure of his wi&s;|dome and omnipotence in the lea&s;t and meanesi beings.</P>
<P>Having undertaken to
<PB REF="12">
write of <HI>Ultima Thule,</HI> which is a poor little Land, in com|pari&s;on of other Countrys and Provinces: I found God had not omitted to di&s;tribute there &s;ome &s;igns of his Almighty power, in &s;everal things that all may wonder at, which hath cau&s;ed me to communi|cate them to others in this Treati&s;e, and thereby grati|fie the curious Reader. Ma|ny &s;eek far abroad the won|derful works of God, either by reading or travelling in forreign and remote parts; whereas we have them as ad|mirable among&s;t us, if they
<PB REF="13">
were right con&s;idered; but as we care not for what we dayly &s;ee, we think it therefore not worthy to be Communicated to others, who would neverthele&s;s e|&s;teem it rare and wonder|ful. Whence it is come, that none of tho&s;e that have been before me in <HI>Feroe,</HI> hath taken the pains&punc; to leave a|ny thing in writing of the Quality and Constitution of that Country. But being come thither a Stranger, and remarking many effects of nature not u&s;ual in my own Coun|try,
<PB REF="13">
I would not live I|dle, without the examinati|on; and con&s;idering thereof, endeavouring to doe my Countrymen, that are not informed of this Lands Na|ture, &s;ome &s;mall &s;ervice, by the Notification of what I have di&s;covered&punc; I pray therefore, and de&s;ire the <HI>Courteous Reader</HI> to take in good part this my La|bour, which I have de&s;ti|ned to the Common good; and if he find any thing imperfect, expound it in the be&s;t meaning, every one ha|ving his faults.

<P>THe I&s;lands of <HI>Feroe</HI> in them|&s;elves, are only &s;ome high rocks, ari&s;ing out of the wild Sea, and covered with a portion of thin Earth. For <HI>Feroe</HI> doth con&s;i&s;t of many I&s;lands that are high Hills, of hard &s;tone, &s;trangely divided from each other, by deep and rapid &s;treams of water. And that the &s;aid Hills or Mountains might be u&s;eful to mankind, and the Lords ho|ly Name, in this latter age of the world, be prais'd by true Chri&s;tians, in the mid&s;t of the &s;torming Sea; it hath plea|&s;ed the Divine Providence to cover the valley between the Mountains, and the
<PB N="2" REF="17">
&s;ides of the Hills, almo&s;t every where, with two foot thick of Earth; &s;ome|where thicker or thinner, according to the nature of the place; whence doth grow, not only abundance of Gra&s;s for Cattel, but al&s;o Corn for the mainte|nance of man. Wherefore if the land, as other even Countreys, could be cul|tivated and inhabited; many thou&s;ands of men, proportionably to the great|ne&s;s and number of the I&s;lands, might there live and &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But the people dwell only by the Sea-&s;ide; where it is lowe&s;t and mo&s;t convenient for them to get to Sea with their Boats, and ply their Fi&s;hing; there being almo&s;t every where high promontories, whence no body can come down, nor get up; though there be &s;ome dangerous and terrible places, whence they al&s;o launch out their Boats to Sea, to go a Fi&s;hing; where they mu&s;t have &s;trong Ropes in the Boat, that tho&s;e on Land may &s;ome|times help the people out, if they are in any danger; &s;ome al&s;o, who are the mo&s;t, live in creeks, inletts, and havens, that are many, convenient, and good for Seamen to lay in their Ships in time

of danger. And where they live they have inclo&s;ed a &s;mall piece of ground, which they Till to get Gra&s;s and Corn; calling &s;uch Clo&s;es, <HI>Boe;</HI> The other part without the inclo&s;ure, con&s;i&s;ting in Valleys and Hills, and &s;ometimes in hills only, is a thou&s;and times larger, and is called <HI>Hawe,</HI> where their Sheep feed both Winter and Summer, and their Kine only in Summer; This part is ne|ver Tilled, neither can it be &s;o, becau&s;e the Inhabitants live along the Sea &s;ide for their Fi&s;hing &s;ake, and other conve|niency, having neverthele&s;s the full pro|fit thereof, for they keep there as ma|ny Sheep as ever the place can feed.</P>
<P>A part of the i&s;lands of <HI>Feroe</HI> is In|habited, and a part furni&s;hed with Cat|tel; they are in their greatne&s;s Havens, Creeks, Inletts, and other circum&s;tan|ces as followeth. <HI>Fugloe</HI> or Fowle-I&s;land, which is the mo&s;t North Ea&s;t, is pretty high and &s;omething flat on the top, with high Clifts almo&s;t round a|bout, three Engli&s;h miles long, and two broad, where it is broade&s;t; having a little Creek on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, called <HI>Hatterviig;</HI> though it be unfit for Ships

The &s;aid valley is about a mile long from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and therefore the Inhabitants have Boats lying on the Ea&s;t and on the We&s;t &s;ides, that they, according to the Wind, may ply their Fi&s;hing on either &s;ide &s;uch Valleys (as al&s;o other places, where the pa&s;&s;age o|ver land from one water to another is but &s;hort) are called in the Language of <HI>Feroe, Eide,</HI> whereof there are many, to the great benefit of the Country.</P>

If it falleth on the Sea it takes up an incredible quan|tity of water, &s;o that one may &s;ee deep Cavities in the Sea till the water runs together again, and what Fi&s;hes are then in that water are drawn up by &s;uch a whirlewind.

<P>It is very ob&s;ervable, that when the &s;aid <HI>Boffve</HI> breaketh in bad weather, it doth &s;o three or &s;even times together, without cea&s;ing, and then re&s;teth &s;ome time, therefore when the Inhabitants come to &s;uch a <HI>Boffve,</HI> and mu&s;t needs over it, they lye &s;till untill the <HI>Boffve</HI> hath broken, and then get over it &s;pee|dily with their Boat.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the <HI>Boffve</HI> breaks al&s;o in &s;till weather, when it is very warm, and when there will be Fro&s;t or Snow. Thirdly, when &s;ome Boat goeth &s;ome|thing near the land over the <HI>Boffve</HI> that breaks not then, but lyeth &s;till, it break|eth up unawares of it &s;elf, and often bringeth people in danger.

<P>The Inhabitants are in this &s;imple o|pinion, that the Sea is &s;en&s;ible, and that the <HI>Boffves</HI> cannot endure the Iron of the Boat.

On the other&s;ide the Fire D. adhears to the Earth A. as to a fit matter, from which it receiveth force, and can exer|ci&s;e its Functions; and Earth again receiveth Fire lovingly, that it may be warmed by it, and produce its fruits.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding that the Elements are in their nature &s;o contrary to one another, neverthele&s;e the one will not, nor can be without the other, &s;uffer|ing each other by a temperature, but when that is wanting, &s;o that there be either exce&s;s or defect, nature then &s;uf|fereth, and is moved by Antipathy, by which rea&s;on, this unexpected mo|tion doth happen in the water o|ver tho&s;e grounds that are called <HI>Boff|ves.</HI></P>
<P>For it is &s;een in <HI>Feroe,</HI> when the Air is very warm, &s;o that there ari&s;eth a Fog from the Sea, rendring the Air

dusky, that not only the Currents run a great deal &s;wifter and &s;tronger then at other times, but the Sea al&s;o grow|eth &s;tormy, beating again&s;t the Land, and the <HI>Boffves</HI> break out though it be &s;till weather; which happeneth becau&s;e of the Antipathy that is be|tween Water and warmth in its ex|ce&s;s, whereby Water &s;uffereth in its nature.</P>
<P>Quite contrary, this happeneth al&s;o when there will come a &s;trong Fro&s;t and Snow in Winter: the Currents grow then &s;tronger, The Sea beats, the <HI>Boffves</HI> ari&s;e, though it be very &s;till weather, becau&s;e there happeneth a deficiency in the temperature of warmth, water being forced to lo&s;e a part of its natural heat, and there|fore cannot keep its innate fluiddity, but mu&s;t, by &s;uffering in its nature, let it &s;elf be chang'd to a &s;tanding ri|gid matter, namely Ice, which affect the Elements, do perceive afore hand, and by the vertue of their Magnettical Antipathy, move them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Motion is al&s;o perceived in hou|&s;es, for it happeneth in <HI>Feroe,</HI> that when

there is a great &s;torm, and the wind cannot have its pa&s;&s;age between tho&s;e many hills, as in plain ground, that it is &s;ometimes quite &s;till in the Valleys; &s;o that one may go with a light between the hou&s;es; and on the contrary the gathered wind comes afterwards a great deal &s;tronger and more terrible, but before &s;uch weather cometh, or that one can perceive any thing of it, as the water ari&s;eth before the coming of a hard Fro&s;t, &s;o are the hou&s;es moved before this &s;tormy weather cometh, &s;o that every nail of the hou&s;e cracks, though the hou&s;es be &s;carce moved af|terwards, when the &s;torm beats upon them, they being low and Fortified a|bout with thick walls of Turffs and Stones, which motion mu&s;t therefore nece&s;&s;arily happen in the manner afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>But that the <HI>Boffves</HI> break when there comes a Boat over them, hath a far more hidden cau&s;e, though it may hap|pen by the afore&s;aid Magnettical Sym|pathy. We have declared above how it is with the Load&s;tone in that Coun|trey, on the Rocks near <HI>Sumboe Munk</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="34">
and I doubt not but there being &s;o &s;trong a Magnet in tho&s;e Rocks that are &s;o little above the water, there may al&s;o be a Magnet in &s;uch grounds, whence it comes, that when a Boat pa&s;&s;eth o|ver them, the Load&s;tone by its Sympa|thy, attracts the Iron of the Boat, which that &s;hallow water not being a|ble to endure, ri&s;eth it &s;elf, though I leave herein every one to his own judg|ment.</P>
<P>Concerning the Current of the &s;tream it runneth very &s;wi&s;tly about the points of Land, e&s;pecially in the new and full Moon, eight men in a Boat not being able to overcome it, but mu&s;t &s;tay till it hath run out, and turneth it &s;elf by rea&s;on of which it happeneth often, that when the poor Inhabitants are at Sea about their Fi|&s;hing, and there cometh an unexpected &s;torm, the &s;tream being again&s;t them, they mu&s;t &s;tay on the &s;ame place, at all adventure, untill the turning of the &s;tream, and till they get the Cur|rent with them towards the Land; but if the &s;torm groweth too &s;trong, tho&s;e poor people often come to misfortunes.
<PB N="37" REF="34">
It cannot be well expre&s;t with a pen, how fierce the Sea is, nor to what height it rai&s;eth it &s;elf, when the wind and the &s;tream are again&s;t one another. And it is ob&s;ervable as is &s;aid above, that when the Current runneth again&s;t the wind, the wind bloweth with great|er force then it doth el&s;e, and when the &s;tream runneth before the wind, it &s;tilleth it &s;elf, &s;o that they &s;eem at fir&s;t to &s;trive again&s;t each other, as two enemies, and afterwards to grow mild|er when one of them doth fly. I mu&s;t here relate an Example of the Sea's ter|riblene&s;s by the rea&s;on afore&s;aid. The little I&s;land <HI>Kolter,</HI> which is de&s;cribed above, is expo&s;ed to the open Sea on the we&s;t &s;ide, and there is towards the Main a Promontory thirty Fathoms high, where the Sea almo&s;t every win|ter breaks over with a We&s;tern wind, and that in &s;uch quantity, that the In|habitants are &s;ometimes in danger, though the Sea has yet 50 Fathoms to run without the Clifts, before it reacheth the Land.</P>
<P>It happened for &s;ome years ago, that there lay a large &s;tone &s;ix foot long and
<PB N="38" REF="35">
four foot thick and broad, on a cor|ner of the &s;aid Promontory, which &s;tone the proud Sea tumbled about and threw &s;ome paces from the place where it lay before; that &s;eems incredible, if one con&s;iders the bigne&s;s of the &s;tone, and the height of the Mountain, and one might well &s;ay how is it po&s;&s;ible that the Sea can ri&s;e fifty Ells up in the Air, but it is neverthele&s;s a perfect truth, for it hath not only been rela|ted to me by the Countrymen of the I&s;land, but it lying in my Pari&s;h, I have my &s;elf been there, and exactly con&s;i|dered the place; and he that takes good notice of it, may rather won|der, then conceive how it can be &s;o.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hers &s;ay al&s;o that when there hath been &s;ome days &s;uch a &s;trange &s;torm of water and wind, and the wind afterwards &s;tilleth it &s;elf; &s;o that the Inhabitants dare row out on Fi&s;hing. There is neverthele&s;s an extraordinary great motion every where at Sea; &s;o that &s;ometimes they are as it were, lifted up to the Heaven, and pre&s;ently come down as it were, to the Aby&s;&s;m

<P>As for the motion of Tides them&s;elves they perfect their cour&s;e according to the Moon here as well as in other pla|ces, where there are ordinary tides, by an ebb of &s;ix hours, and a Flood of the like &s;pace of time</P>
<P>Yet their cour&s;e is different according as they beat again&s;t the Rocks and points of Land, and as the ground is under them; whence it comes that the particular &s;treams alter their cour&s;e, and run directly again&s;t the general Tides, &s;uch &s;treams being called here <HI>Ider.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the general Currents here, the Seaman that is not much acquainted with the Land may have this for information.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, where the &s;treams run even between the land, there is a principal Current; as between <HI>Sude|roefiord, Staapenfiord, Kal&s;oefierd, Skuo|fiord</HI> and <HI>Fugloefiord.</HI> When the Cur|rent
<PB N="40" REF="36">
runneth here to the We&s;t&punc; it is called We&s;t-fall, and when it runneth to the Ea&s;t, Ea&s;t-fall; but in <HI>Kal&s;oefiord</HI> the Ea&s;t-fall runneth Northward, and the We&s;t-fall Southward, becau&s;e of the points of Land.</P>
<P>Secondly it doth not run with equall rapidity during the &s;ix hours, but its cour&s;e can be divided into three parts; In the fir&s;t third part it runneth prerty fa&s;t, changing and augmenting its force more and more. In the &s;econd, third part, it is very rapid, and is here called <HI>Braaddew;</HI> In the la&s;t third part it lo|&s;eth its force by little and little, till it comes to turn, and then the &s;tream is as it were half dead. In the third place, the Tide is not allways equally &s;trong, but it is &s;tronge&s;t in the new and full Moon, three days before and three days after, lo&s;ing after of its force till the fir&s;t and la&s;t quarter, and it renews its &s;trength again from the fir&s;t and la&s;t quarter, till the new and full Moon, though according to the Moons ver|tue it be neither always equally &s;trong, but in the Spring and Summer when the Sun acteth mo&s;t on the earth, &s;o that
<PB N="41" REF="36">
the warmth reflecteth thence, and in the Dog days, when the air is hotte&s;t, by rea&s;on of the heat of the Canicule, it is &s;tronger in every change of the Moon, then it u&s;eth to be in Autum or Winter; from which effect may doubt|le&s;s be concluded, that the Sun, toge|ther with the Moon, and the inward warmth of the Earth doth produce the motion of the Tides.</P>
<P>For the 4<HI>th.</HI> when the &s;tream runneth in the Inlets at E. or when it is Ea&s;t-fall, it is then We&s;t-fall by the land, and in the Iders, and &s;o quite contrary, &s;o that when the Ma&s;ter of a Ship cannot ad|vance his voyage in the middle of the Inlets, he mu&s;t &s;eek his advantage by the Iders, for they &s;tretch them&s;elves in &s;ome places a mile from the Land.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the Tide beginneth, that is, the water ri&s;eth at We&s;t fall, and when that is out, and it is <HI>Braaddew,</HI> it is Floud or highe&s;t water, that is We&s;t-fall in all the principal &s;treams of every Inlet, but afterwards cometh the Ea&s;t-fall from the Land, beginning thereby by little and little to grow low water, but how high or low the water ri&s;eth

or falleth in <HI>Feroe,</HI> cannot be exactly de&s;cribed, there being a great ine|quallity in it, both by rea&s;on of the changes of the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and of the Moon, wherein the &s;treams are &s;tronge&s;t; Notwith&s;tanding the &s;tream ari&s;eth much higher at we&s;t of the Land then at Ea&s;t, u&s;ually &s;even Fathoms at We&s;t, and but three at Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth place it is very needful for a Pilot to know when it is high wa|ter or We&s;t-fall in <HI>Feroe,</HI> not that he might thereby run &s;ecurely over Rocks and grounds; for he hath no great need of that in <HI>Feroe,</HI> but that he may know how the &s;tream runneth, and advance his voyage accordingly; all Marriners having erred therein till this day, even the Sea expert Hollanders, who in their Sea Mirrour, write that a South and North Moon maketh highe&s;t water in <HI>Feroe.</HI> Tho&s;e that have traded in this Country and in their Voyage have ta|ken notice of the Tides, have found it otherwi&s;e, and believe quite contrary, that an Ea&s;t and We&s;t Moon giveth highe&s;t water; wherein they doe not much erre, but I have enquired about
<PB N="43" REF="37">
this bu&s;ine&s;s of old under&s;tanding men, who neverthele&s;s take little notice of highe&s;t water, nor know wherefore it is &s;o ob&s;ervable; but only note their We&s;t and Ea&s;t fall, which they never|thele&s;s only mark by Flood and low water, not under&s;tanding what an Ea&s;t or We&s;t Moon &s;ignifieth, and they &s;ay altogether, that the &s;econd day after New or Full Moon, it is perfect We&s;t-fall, that is highe&s;t water at &s;ix of the Clock in the morning, and Ea&s;t-fall or Low-water at twelve of the Clock at Noon; whence an expert man can con|clude that a North Ea&s;t Moon, and a South We&s;t, make highe&s;t water, the fir&s;t day the Moon beginneth to fill, that is at five a Clock and fifteen mi|nutes in the morning, and then they have highe&s;t water, or We&s;t fall, in new or full Moon&punc; in <HI>Feroe,</HI> a North Ea&s;t and a South We&s;t Moon making high|e&s;t water in all the principal Streams above mentioned. In the other parti|cular Streams, it is high water at dif|ferent hours, in &s;ome before, and in &s;ome after the ordinary time; for in <HI>Leerviigs-fiord,</HI> an Ea&s;t North Ea&s;t, and

<P>I dare not undertake to explicate the &s;everal Streams, with their Iders, there being often in one Inlet five different Currents that run again&s;t one another; &s;o that I verily believe if the Learned Philo&s;opher <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> were here him|&s;elf to undertake that work, he would find no le&s;s difficulty therein, then in his Euripe. Neverthele&s;s I cannot forbear writing &s;omething of the little &s;tream, between <HI>Stromoe</HI> and <HI>O&s;teroe,</HI> which &s;eemeth very &s;trange. Though that &s;tream on both &s;ides of the water be wholly &s;till and dead, and there be a very &s;hort way over the grounds be|tween both Lands, it runneth neverthe|le&s;s

forward and backward, according to the ordinary Changes of the Moon, &s;o &s;wiftly, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to row again&s;t it; but one mu&s;t expect till it returneth. Whereof the cau&s;e is this; There goeth neither Ebb nor Tide at South of the &s;tream, but at North the water ri&s;eth and falleth, though there be no &s;tream; therefore when the Tide comes, the water runneth over to the South Sinus, and when it falleth again, it runneth over the grounds from the South into the North, yet no &s;tream can be perceived, becau&s;e the Inlet groweth wider on both &s;ides, and is deep in it &s;elf, even as in the Main Sea. Before <HI>Feroe</HI> no &s;tream is di&s;cerned, though there be &s;ome, as every where in the world, but when it comes to the I&s;lands, the free &s;low cour&s;e of it is hindered; and therefore it is forced by the narrow Streights between the I|&s;lands, to thru&s;t it &s;elf between the Lands, as a River would do through a Sluce.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, this Stream is very terrible and dangerous of it &s;elf, e&s;pecially when there is a Storm and a &s;trong Current, it draweth to it &s;elf all that comes too near it, and as it were &s;wallows it up, &s;o that a Ship cannot &s;ave her &s;elf nor avoid it, if &s;he approacheth it too near. For a few years ago, the &s;aid <HI>John Jona|&s;on</HI> &s;aw about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Tide in Stormy weather, a great Ship come into that Stream, whereof he &s;aw &s;ometimes the Fore-ma&s;t, &s;ometimes the Mizen-ma&s;t, and the Sea &s;trike above the Maine Quarter, a while after which, he could &s;ee nothing more of the Ship. The Sea

expert <HI>Baggowandel,</HI> in his book cal|led the VVatching Eye, makes men|tion of this VVhirle pool, and &s;aith, that Skipper <HI>Peter Odevald</HI> gave him knowledge of it, I remember the time that the &s;aid <HI>Odevald</HI> got to know this Stream, for he and his Folks told me that his Ship was drawn into it before he was aware, and that he could not then Steer her, the water beating in on all &s;ides, to a great height of the Ma&s;t, and he could not &s;ave him&s;elf with his Sailes, becau&s;e it was quite &s;till weather, the Ma&s;ter affirming that he was never before in &s;uch peril and danger, though at la&s;t it plea&s;ed God to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, &s;o that he came off again by the reflux of the Stream, and arrived &s;afe to <HI>Thors-haven,</HI> whither he was bound.</P>
<P>Secondly according to the &s;aid <HI>John Jona&s;ons</HI> Relation, the ground round a|bout this VVhirle-pool is eighty or ninety Fathom deep, over which ground the Stream goeth &s;till and quiet, with|out any boi&s;tering, afterwards round about the VVhirle-pool, the ground lyeth 25, 30, to 35 Fathoms deep, over
<PB N="49" REF="40">
which ground the Sea with its waves begins to lift it &s;elf, to work hard, to draw, and to whirle about: afterwards there ri&s;eth a third ground, which ly|eth eight, ten, to twelve Fathom deep, which formeth it &s;elf Snaile wi&s;e in a Circle four times double. Nature hath made this high ground with points, as the tops of &s;ome Cliffts; whence it comes that upon the points there is only eight Fathoms deep of water, and between them ten or twelve Fathoms: wherefore when a Fi&s;her Boat comes upon that uneven round Bank, it is whirled about by the &s;tream that turns round about the&s;e high Cliffts, and that with &s;uch a &s;wiftne&s;s, that young people unu&s;ed to &s;uch a whirle, mu&s;t lay them&s;elves down in the Boat to avoid giddine&s;s of the head, and it is to be noted, that, be&s;ides this &s;wift and ha&s;ty Gyration, the Boat is turned about in another Circle, according to the Snail-wi&s;e fi|gure of the ground.</P>
<P>In the third place, between the&s;e four round grounds, there are three
<PB N="50" REF="41">
Channels or Conduits, wherein the Sea worketh &s;till and runs about in the &s;aid &s;mall turnings; and before, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, where the ground be|gins, there is a Gulf where the &s;tream runs in, as through a Sluce; though within it worketh but &s;oftly; The&s;e Channels are 25, 30, to 35 Fathoms deep; now the&s;e Channels having un|even bottoms, and the water flowing about in &s;low whirles, it &s;eems, that the form of the bottom mu&s;t be like that of the Superficie, that is to &s;ay, with &s;mall bowings and Cavities in it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, in the mid'&s;t of this VVhirle-pool, there is a deep hole, that is 50 or 55 Fathoms deep, neer the very bottome; in the middle thereof it is generally 61 Fathoms deep; the inward water is even and &s;till above, only it runs &s;lowly in a Circle, which may ea&s;ily be &s;een by the Seas Scum, falling out of the Whirle pool, that floweth round; on the South &s;ide of that hole ari&s;eth out of the water a Rock ten Fathoms high,
<PB N="51" REF="41">
called <HI>Sumboe Munk</HI> about which there is but fifteen fathoms deepth. At North of <HI>Sumboe Munk,</HI> there are &s;ix le&s;&s;er Rocks, between which and the <HI>Munk</HI> there is the depth of three or four Fa|thoms. And it is to be noted, as is &s;aid above, that on the&s;e Rocks the Compa&s;s runneth round about, even as the Whirle-pool it &s;elf; whereby it is &s;poiled. So it is worth ob&s;erva|tion, that on <HI>Sumboe Munk</HI> there is an extraordinary great cold, even in the hotte&s;t Sun&s;hine and be&s;t weather of Summer, &s;o that the people that get up the <HI>Munk</HI> to take Fowle, can hard|ly endure the cold, be&s;ides the Fowles that are hatcht and keep them&s;elves there, are very lean, &s;o that there is nothing on them but the bare Fea|thers. I am in great doubt whence &s;uch an extraordinary cold &s;hould come; the water about <HI>Feroe,</HI> though it be cold in it &s;elf, yet by rea&s;on of its faltne&s;s and perpetual motion&punc; cau&s;ing u&s;ually there a temperate Winter; I cannot therefore conje|cture that this Streams continual mo|tion
<PB N="52" REF="42">
&s;hould contrarywi&s;e cau&s;e &s;uch an extraordinary cold on the <HI>Munk.</HI> One may conclude, that &s;ince there is &s;o &s;trong a Magnete in the Center of the afore&s;aid le&s;&s;er Rocks, there may be al&s;o a &s;trong Magnete in the other round grounds, by rea&s;on of who&s;e vertue, be&s;ides the Streams, Ships can &s;o ea&s;ily be brought into that danger. And if there be a Magneti|cal vertue therein, whereof I doubt not, I leave to others Judgment, whe|ther it can be the cau&s;e of that extra|ordinary cold.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;ert here the &s;econd Figure.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, at North of the Whirle-pool over again&s;t <HI>Suderoe,</HI> &s;ome other grounds do advance equally forward, wherefore the &s;treams altogether e|qually, and cau&s;e there al&s;o a terrible motion of the Sea.

<P>The Whirle&punc;pool under <HI>Sandoe</HI> tur|neth about to its very middle point, and hath no depth in the mid'&s;t, I have my &s;elf been twice on the third Whirle-pool between the North I|&s;lands, and when one comes near it, it droweth the Boat to it &s;elf, as if it would &s;wallow it; &s;o that the people have enough to doe to keep the &s;tream from getting the upper hand, all tho&s;e of one &s;ide rowing &s;trongly again&s;t the Gulf with their Oares, while&s;t all tho&s;e of the other &s;ide, with their Oares, row quite contrary.

<P>Among&s;t others <HI>Athan.

in deep cavities, even as is found in all the Whirle pools of <HI>Feroe,</HI> and in that of <HI>Botthen.</HI> In the like manner, the &s;aid <HI>Kircherus</HI> in his <HI>Ta|bula Geographica Hydrographica,</HI> de|&s;cribes many Sea Gulfs through the whole world, but they are all found near the Continent, or between &s;mall I&s;lands; <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI> are &s;o in the <HI>Scicillian</HI> Sea, the one under <HI>Sci|cilly,</HI> the other near the point of <HI>Ca|labria,</HI> and to confirm the thing the more, <HI>Kircherus</HI> &s;aith, that there &s;tands a high Rock in the mid&s;t of the &s;tream which mu&s;t be as the <HI>Munk</HI> in the mid'&s;t of <HI>Sumboes</HI> Whirle pool de|&s;cribed above.

<P>Secondly, Mr. <HI>Peter Clau&s;on</HI> in his De&s;cription of <HI>Norway</HI> writes, that the water runs about in &s;uch turbu|lent and boi&s;terous manner, that one can hear it &s;ome Leagues off at Sea, which would not be if there were any

deep ground to make a &s;wallowing Gulf, &s;ince the &s;tille&s;t water hath the deepe&s;t bottom; but that great noi&s;e is made, fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is a narrow and &s;mall pa&s;&s;age, between two I&s;lands for the large Ocean to run through with the Tide to the Continent, and as narrow to fall back again into the Maine Sea; and be&s;ides that over|come tho&s;e high grounds, which be|ing winding in the manner of a Snail, rea&s;on doth per&s;wade that huge beat|ing and running about mu&s;t make a terrible noi&s;e.</P>
<P>In the third place, Mr. <HI>Peter Clau|&s;on</HI> afore&s;aid, writes, that what whole Trees that &s;tream draweth in, come out again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ugged with torn Roots and Branches, which happeneth by rea&s;on that the&s;e high round, and &s;harp grounds, between which the Trees are whirled about by the &s;trong &s;tream, doth beat and wear off the Roots, Branches, Bark, and the up|permo&s;t of the Trunk thereof. Of which &s;ort of Trees there comes ma|ny a&s;hoar to <HI>Feroe,</HI> which would not

happen if there were any pervious Gulf, for then the hole would be large; and the water run &s;till round about, and when any thing came to the Gulf, it would ha&s;tily run through it without any damage, as one may plainly &s;ee, putting a piece of Wood in a Funnel, and fill the Funnel full of water, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Kircherus,</HI> to &s;trengthen his opini|on, writes, that near that high Rock in the mid&s;t of the &s;tream, there is an Aby&s;me, through which the Water is &s;wallowed; in that manner there &s;hould fir&s;t be a <HI>Vortex</HI> or Whirle pool, and within it a <HI>Vor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">go</HI> or Sea-gulf, that &s;hould have its way under <HI>Nor|way,</HI> and its out let within <HI>Botthen.</HI> If it were &s;o, there would not then come out again the tenth part of what it &s;walloweth, whereas the Whirle|pool rendreth as much as comes into it, and the matter that is come out of it never returns into it again, the &s;tream that hath driven it out, tran&s;|porting it into the Main, whence it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">omes driving to <HI>Feroe,</HI> I&s;land, and
<PB N="58" REF="48">
<HI>Greenland;</HI> as is more then &s;ufficiently known. In the like manner what comes up again in <HI>Botthen,</HI> is driven by the &s;tream to one of tho&s;e Sea Coa&s;ts, or el&s;e out into the Ea&s;t Sea, and one &s;hould then &s;ee many of tho&s;e Sea Wrecks in the Ea&s;t Sea, whereof nothing hath been yet perceived. Fi|nally, it is openly known to all tho&s;e that have any ways frequented the Northern Countreys, that the Inha|bitants that dwell on the I&s;lands and the Continent about <HI>Moskoe-Strome,</HI> row out upon the Whirle pool, when the weather is good, and the &s;tream &s;low in its reflux, and fi&s;h there abun|dance of fi&s;h called <HI>Sey,</HI> as I have been newly told by a Reverend man worthy of belief, very well known in that place.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s neverthele&s;s, that there may be a deep hole near that high Rock, which if there be, as I do not at all doubt, then <HI>Moskoe Strom</HI> doth agree in the ground perfectly with <HI>Sumboes</HI> Whirle-pool. And it is in truth an admirable work of Nature,
<PB N="59" REF="48">
that as &s;he hath wonderfully formed the Shell of a Snaile, &s;o &s;he forms the like figures in the air, for Whirl-winds, and in the ground for Whirl-pools, &s;etting in the midde&s;t of &s;uch whirle|pools, a token to be aware of danger, and that nature might not be a hin|derance to it &s;elf, it hath made therein a receptacle or deep hole to receive and keep what the &s;tream draweth in from time to time, and afterwards re|&s;tored it when it runs out again.</P>
<P>Neither will the Gulf within <HI>Bot|then</HI> be found to be otherwi&s;e then a round ground, &s;ince there is al&s;o per|ceived &s;uch a terrible noi&s;e and boi|&s;tering as <HI>Olaus Magnus</HI> makes men|tion of, which comes from the rapid ebb and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">loud through the long <HI>Both|micus</HI> of the Ea&s;t-Sea, who&s;e great force yet is not much perceived, be|cau&s;e of the deep ground every where, and therefore beats the harder upon &s;uch ground as ari&s;eth within <HI>Botthen,</HI> which is perceived likewi&s;e in the &s;treight near the I&s;le of <HI>Alland,</HI> where becau&s;e the grounds lye &s;hallow, here

<P>As Whirle pools have hitherto gi|ven much to think to many, &s;o &s;treight Currents have not bu&s;ied the thoughts of a le&s;&s;er number, to explicate fun|damentally their true cau&s;e, ground, and manner: and though they did invent &s;ome cau&s;es, they have not yet found the true Form and Mo|dell.</P>
<P>My intention is not to &s;et up my &s;elf again&s;t &s;uch eminent Philo&s;ophers, but only to write down what I have experimented and di&s;cerned in nature; if I can thereby bring any light to na|tural Hi&s;tory, I hope it will not di&s;|plea&s;e the Ingenious Reader.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, here is &s;et down the inward cau&s;e, namely, the &s;ecret Magnetick Sympathetical and Antipathetical ver|tue, proved and explicated above, by which Nature worketh between the Elements, and bringeth them into mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="49">
Secondly, there are found two o|ther active external cau&s;es, the one is the inward warmth of the Earth; the other the heat of the Sun and Stars.</P>
<P>The warmth of the Earth is not as &s;ome wrongfully think, a &s;ubterra|nean fire; for then the Sea &s;hould be mo&s;t moved near <HI>I&s;land, Italy,</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i|cily,</HI> &s;ince there are &s;een vi&s;ible &s;igns of it near them, namely, burning fires in the Mountains of <HI>Hecla, Ve&s;uvio,</HI> and <HI>Aetna.</HI> But there is a natural warmth in the Earth by vertue where|of, Gra&s;s, Herbs, and Trees have their growing motion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s proved by this, that the Sea hath principally in the Spring, in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April;</HI> its chiefe&s;t motion and greate&s;t Ebb and Floud in <HI>Feroe;</HI> when warmth gets the upper hand, and the Earth open|eth it &s;elf for Plants to break out of it, which motion with its Ebb and Floud doth not come, as <HI>Carte&s;ius</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth, from the the Earths Conjunction with the Moon in the Collure of the Sol|&s;tice.

the Eqnator or the Line, and the Moon under the Ecliptick, meeting together in <HI>Aries</HI> and in <HI>Libra,</HI> where the Aequator divideth the Zodiack, and therefore the Sea and Stream are &s;tronge&s;t in the Spring and in Autumn. We will not enter here into the di&s;|pute about the motion of the Earth, but only &s;ay again&s;t it, that if it were &s;o, the Flouds &s;hould be greate&s;t, and the Streams mo&s;t rapid both in the Spring and Autumn, as <HI>Corte&s;ius</HI> him|&s;elf affirmeth, though notwith&s;tanding Ebb and Floud is greate&s;t in the Spring and almo&s;t lea&s;t of all in Autumn, as is known to all the Inhabitants of <HI>Fe|roe,</HI> be&s;ides which, it would al&s;o fol|low that in Summer, when the Moon and the Sun are in <HI>Cancer,</HI> or in Win|ter, when they are in <HI>Capricorn,</HI> or in the Collure of the Sol&s;ticies, the floods &s;hould be lea&s;t, and the &s;treams weak|e&s;t, whereas in the midde&s;t of Summer the Floud is found to be greate&s;t, and the &s;tream almo&s;t &s;tronge&s;t, one may therefore rea&s;onably attribute it to the cau&s;e, which hath then mo&s;t force,
<PB N="63" REF="50">
namely, the warmth of Earth, which then a&s;cends, and produceth its ver|tue.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on might well per&s;wade it to be impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a great and deep water &s;hould be altered thereby; &s;uch a warmth being very moderate, my rea&s;on would al&s;o dictate to me the &s;ame, if the Magnetical Sympa|thy whereby this warmth is &s;o qua|lified in the Water, were not in nature. There is neither but a mean warmth in a mans &s;tomach, which when it is hotte&s;t of all, cannot be compared with the heat of fire, yet in a &s;hort time, it Cooks and Dige&s;ts Meat to &s;uch an alteration, by its natural ver|tue, that the greate&s;t fire could not do the like with any meat in a Kettle or boyling Pot.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o proved that the heat of the Sun and Stars moveth the Water, by this, that when the warmth of the Earth is a&s;cended in Plants, and there is Rain and Cold Weather, the Stream is then moderate, but when the Sun &s;hineth hot, and it is Calm weather,
<PB N="64" REF="51">
not only the Water is moved, and the Boffves break out, as is &s;aid before, but the &s;treams al&s;o are then very ra|pid, and the Ebb and Floud higher then ordinary; &s;pecially during the Dogdays, when the <HI>Canicule,</HI> together with the Sun are hotte&s;t, but when the Dogdays are pa&s;t, and the Sun advanceth to the South, the force of the Streams is weakned more and more untill Winter, during which &s;ea&s;on it is but half as &s;trong as in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, there is an other ex|traordinary cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of the waters motion in Winter, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hardne&s;s of the fro&s;t, and having &s;poken of it above, the Reader is re|ferr'd thereunto.</P>
<P>God having thus created nature, the Sea in the beginning was brought into a motion, which will la&s;t as long as the world doth exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The form or manner of this Ebb and Floud hath mo&s;t of all perplexed Philo&s;ophers, every one having inven|ted an Hypothe&s;is to Explicate it.

God is wonderful in all his works, and what &s;eems harde&s;t and difficulte&s;t of all to our under&s;tanding is often mo&s;t plain and ea&s;ie; &s;o this wonderful augmentation and diminution of the water doth con&s;i&s;t in a meer motion to and fro between the Continents, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and from We&s;t to Ea&s;t: and that in great waves, as will be proved by the following argu|ments.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the whole may be known by its parts, &s;eeing that the drops of wa|ter are of a round figure, one may conclude that water is round. Like|wi&s;e, as one &s;eeth the Superficies of the water to be moved by the wind into waves, one may al&s;o a&s;&s;uredly conclude, that the motion of the great Ocean is made in Wayes; &s;o the <HI>Boffves,</HI> whether it be by heat or cold, forming them&s;elves into waves, the larger Sea doth the like al|&s;o.</P>
<P>Secondly, this is proved by experi|ence in Nature; Tho&s;e of <HI>Feroe,</HI> by this experience call this manner of

Ebb and Floud Ea&s;t and We&s;t-fall; Ea&s;t-fall is that which with its waves falleth on the Ea&s;t of <HI>Norway;</HI> We&s;t-fall is, when the Sea is moved and fal|leth back with its waves to the VVe&s;t part of <HI>Greenland.</HI> The Ea&s;t-fall gi|veth in <HI>Feroe</HI> Ebb or lowe&s;t water, falling to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Norway;</HI> and making there highe&s;t water: We&s;t-fall maketh highe&s;t water or Floud in <HI>Feroe,</HI> becau&s;e when the Floud falleth back from the We&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> the Waves ri&s;e and form them&s;elves higher and higher again&s;t <HI>Feroe,</HI> ac|cording to the nature of Waves, which is plainly proved by this, that at Ea&s;t of <HI>Feroe</HI> the Water ri&s;eth but three Fathoms, and at We&s;t &s;even Fathoms; the di&s;tance whereof is but forty miles in Longitude: Yea, one may ea&s;ily perceive the Sea to ari&s;e higher at We&s;t of <HI>Suderoe,</HI> then at Ea&s;t; though the Land where it is broade&s;t, be not above eight miles broad.</P>
<P>On the contrary, <HI>Galilaeus Galilaei</HI> teacheth, that it is the nature of water

to lift up it &s;elf towards its extremi|ties, and run Horizontally between the Latitude, whereunto it is an&s;wer|ed, that when the water hath its own motion without re&s;i&s;tance, it floweth Horizontally, without waves, as through Conduits, but when there is a re&s;i&s;tance on both &s;ides, the bottom is uneven, and there is no outlet, the one part by its perpetual motion dri|ving the other, it mu&s;t needs, accor|ding to the &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>Kircherus,</HI> ari&s;e and fall in waves, wherefore if it were as <HI>Galilaeo</HI> believeth, either there would never be Ebb or Floud in <HI>Feroe,</HI> in the Flemi&s;h I&s;lands, or the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> which both lye in the mid'&s;t of large Seas, where the Ocean &s;hould flow Horizontally, or el&s;e both We&s;t-fall and Ea&s;t-fall &s;hould make there Ebb and Floud, which never happeneth in Nature.</P>

<P>It is certainly true, that as God hath created all things according to weight, mea&s;ure, and number; a cer|tain wave falling at the we&s;t of <HI>Feroe</HI> in its retiring, Nature hath equalized the&s;e waves in certain number, thick|ne&s;s and length (never to be altered) according to the di&s;tance that is be|tween the Continents; and they are moved in &s;uch an unalterable perfe|ction, that neither the &s;tronge&s;t con|trary wind can hinder their cour&s;e or fall, nor a fore wind procure that they &s;hould come &s;ooner or later; the rea|&s;on is, that the wind moveth but the uppermo&s;t &s;uperficie, but cannot move the deep Aby&s;s thereof: VVhence it cometh, that when the great waves

<P>For a further proof of this former explication, it were to be wi&s;hed that one had or could get an exact de&s;crip|tion of the We&s;t Coa&s;t along <HI>Europe,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and on the other &s;ide the whole Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> and afterwards in the &s;till Sea, all the we&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> and Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as far as it lyeth open to the Sea, when it is highe&s;t water at the points, and in the Bayes, how high the water ri&s;eth and falleth in every

<P>None ought to doubt of it, becau&s;e &s;uch waves are not perceived by Mar|riners, for as little as they can di&s;|cern the motion of the water in the Main Sea, as little can they perceive the waves ri&s;ing or fall, For the dif|ference in forty miles in <HI>Feroe</HI> being but four Fathoms of the waves ri&s;ing, how could it be ob&s;erved by Sailers, Neither can it be di&s;cern'd any where, but about &s;uch I&s;lands at Sea: and having been undi&s;covered and un|try'd hitherto, the wit of many hath invented &s;everal Hypothe&s;is, which are not in nature.</P>
<P>Much le&s;s ought any one to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be &s;educed by particulars,
<PB N="73" REF="55">
which are all irregular, and much of what is written thereof, upon the re|lation of others, erronious. Thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have err'd in de&s;cribing the Currents of <HI>Feroe</HI> after the decla|ration of Marriners: in the &s;ame man|ner <HI>Kircherus,</HI> after the De&s;cription of <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> and the relation of Seamen: al&s;o the &s;tream of <HI>Moskoe,</HI> whereupon he hath grounded a great ab&s;urdity to explicate the nature of Ebb and Floud; which hath made Mr. <HI>Herbinius</HI> in his publick di&s;puta|tion to err &s;o much that all his &s;uppo|&s;itions fall of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But all particulars are explain'd when univer&s;als in their true grounds are right under&s;tood, and the Inlets and Points diligently ob&s;erved. For an example we will take the &s;tream under the the Low Countries in the North Sea, Catigate and the Ea&s;t Sea; according to our general demon|&s;tration we find the Ocean to fall and run into the Channel with the great waves of its motion by an Ea&s;t-fall, as al&s;o to both &s;ides thereof of
<PB N="74" REF="56">
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> afterwards it fills all the Inlets and Harbours of the Coa&s;t of all <HI>Netherland,</HI> thence the &s;tream is divided into two parts or branches, whereof the one runneth Northward, between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> and on both &s;ides fills up all their Havens; The other runneth towards the Ea&s;t, between <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Jutland,</HI> towards <HI>Sweden,</HI> and endeth there its working; running back again &s;ix hours after from thence to the Channel, joyning it &s;elf to the general motion of the Ocean at the We&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> where then it ma|keth highe&s;t water, about this parti|cular Stream, and its Ebb and Floud are the&s;e following points to be con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that it is cau&s;ed by the gene|ral motion of the Ocean, and there+fore the noting of the time thereof cannot contribute to the explanatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this <HI>Phaenomenon;</HI> but the time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the floud without the Channel ought only to be con&s;idered, and from thence learn the motion of the Ocean; all

what is within turning it &s;elf, ac|cording to the ends and points of Land, by a meer Flux and re-flux, as the Ocean falleth &s;ometimes on the Ea&s;t, and &s;ometimes on the we&s;t part thereof.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is ob&s;erved that on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> as al&s;o over again&s;t it, under <HI>Norway,</HI> there cannot be a &s;trong Current, nor great Ebb and Flood, by rea&s;on that the wave which the Ocean drives in|to the Channel, is dimini&s;hed by the many Inlets and Havens that are at the &s;outh end of <HI>England,</HI> and in the reach of Land between high Sand to the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and the &s;tream running af|terwards partly Northward; and the North Sea between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Nor|way,</HI> not being perfectly moved, be|cau&s;e of its narrowne&s;s here and there at Ea&s;t and We&s;t, that little &s;tream, according to its proportion, filleth both &s;ides; whence it comes that one perceiveth no great &s;tream in <HI>Norway,</HI> till one cometh pretty well North, where the Ocean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">loweth without hin|derance,
<PB N="76" REF="57">
and it is even &s;o under the remote part of <HI>Norway,</HI> and other neighbouring places.</P>
<P>In the third place, it is to be doub|ted, whether this Flood and Stream (which comes in through the Chan|nel, and runneth again&s;t <HI>Gottenborough,</HI> runneth not through the <HI>Catigate</HI> into the Ea&s;t Sea, and maketh there an or|dinary &s;tream of Ebb and Floud in &s;ix hours, as in the Ocean. Our <HI>Herbi|nius</HI> denyeth the Ea&s;t Sea all this, and for ought I could learn of our Seamen, they are almo&s;t all in the &s;ame opini|on, not knowing any other thing of a Stream there, then what a con&s;tant Wind can cau&s;e, either out or in through the Sound. Neverthele&s;s, the Stream which comes from the Chan|nel runneth into the Ea&s;t Sea, and out again, though inperceptibly, and all the Ea&s;t Sea (though it cannot ea&s;ily be ob&s;erv'd) hath its ordinary ebb and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oud, which is not only proved by the &s;tream of <HI>Botthen</HI> above mention|ed, but can al&s;o be ea&s;ily perceived by the little Current running between
<PB N="77" REF="57">
<HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> which orderly runneth Ea&s;t and We&s;t, ab&s;olving its Ebb and Floud in &s;ix hours, as I have newly been informed, and have expe|rimented; we have al&s;o the like ex|amples in <HI>Feroe:</HI> at North of <HI>Nol&s;oe</HI> Stream, between <HI>Stromoe</HI> and <HI>O&s;teroe</HI> there is no &s;tream perceived, neither ebb nor floud that can be di&s;cerned, becau&s;e of the depth of the ground; though it be there neverthele&s;s, as is proved by the &s;trong &s;tream at North of <HI>Stromoe,</HI> in the &s;treight between the I&s;lands over the high grounds, de|&s;cribed and explained above, which hath its cour&s;e with the Stream of <HI>Nol|&s;oes</HI> Inlet.</P>
<P>The third proof of the manner in which ebb and floud is effected, de|pends of the Moon, which God hath created as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the motion of the Sea, in exerci&s;ing two offices, by helping the motion thereof, and by directing it.</P>
<P>That the Moon contributeth to its motion, is plainly &s;een, becau&s;e the &s;tream is in general, during the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e
<PB N="78" REF="58">
year, according to the propriety of every &s;ea&s;on, &s;tronge&s;t and ebb and floud greate&s;t, in New and Full Moon, increa&s;ing and dimini&s;hing according as the Moon increa&s;eth or dimini&s;heth its light: wherefore &s;uch a thing hap|peneth, I humbly conceive to be this, warmth being a principal cau&s;e to the motion of water in general, and the Moon being of a cold and moi&s;t na|ture, when the &s;ame receiveth its light from the Sun, it groweth warm thereby, and by this warmth moveth the water. Now &s;ince it is mo&s;t warm when it is in Conjunction or Oppo&s;i|tion with the Sun, becau&s;e then it darts its beams directly upon the Moon. The Moon is then therefore mo&s;t able to move the water, when it is New or at Full. Now the Moon gene|rally retiring every day from the be|ginning of the New Moon, twelve de|grees from the Sun, or coming every day after full Moon twelve degrees nearer it, &s;o as it retireth or cometh nearer the Sun, it &s;hooteth its beams awry on the Moon, and the more by|a&s;&s;ing
<PB N="79" REF="58">
the Suns light is di&s;tributed, the le&s;s warmth doth the Moon receive, and therefore moveth the Sea as its warmth dimini&s;heth, or is increa&s;ed; and therefore the motion of the Sea with its floud and ebb is greate&s;t, not only when it is new, or full Moon, but al&s;o three days before and after, and is lea&s;t when the Moon is in the Quadrate, or fir&s;t and la&s;t quarter, but becau&s;e the Moon being in the Perigeum, or in Conjunction with the Sun, is then nearer both Sun and Earth, it &s;eemeth then to have the greate&s;t warmth of the Sun, and to be able to exerci&s;e its overture on the Sea better, then when it is in the Apo|geum, furthe&s;t from the Sun and Earth, in its oppo&s;ition or filling. The operation of the Moon is never|thele&s;s equal both when it beginneth to be new, and when it is filled; for the Moon having greater warmth and force at new Moon, it is thought to act by reflecting its light towards the Sun; the dark and cola part being tur|ned to the Earth; yet having le&s;s
<PB N="80" REF="59">
warmth and force when it is full, it can neverthele&s;s more conveniently and better pour down what it hath on the Sea, by turning its &s;plendid a&s;pect directly upon it.</P>
<P>But it is very remarkable that two or three days after the beginning of the new or full Moon, the Stream in|crea&s;eth at Floud, and doth not dimi|ni&s;h; which &s;eems to contradict and de&s;troy our demon&s;tration, whereun|to we mu&s;t &s;eek another cau&s;e then the Moon; which in my opinion is this, what&s;oever is heavy and is brought into motion by &s;ome violent force, doth not &s;traight ways dimi|ni&s;h its &s;aid motion, when the cau&s;e hath lo&s;t its force; but rather augments it: it is even &s;o in this ca&s;e; The Moon hath &s;ome difficulty to augment the cour&s;e of the &s;tream when it is weake&s;t, in its fir&s;t and la&s;t quarter, but when it is grown rapid in new and full Moon, it cannot &s;o &s;till it &s;elf a+gain, but increa&s;eth naturally; &s;peci|ally the Mover having lo&s;t in two days time &s;omething of its force.
<PB N="81" REF="59">
This is plainly &s;een in the Sea, for when it hath been moved by a great Storm, it is more unquiet the next day, when the &s;torm is appea&s;ed, then it was while&s;t it la&s;ted; for then cometh that terrible Alde which we have de&s;cribed before, and at the &s;ame time that huge floud which &s;triketh up high in the Air again&s;t the Land. We might al&s;o di&s;cern, that by the Suns effect on the Earth, for it &s;hi|neth hotter in the afternoon then be|fore Mid-day; not that its heat is then in it &s;elf greater then before; but becau&s;e the Sun mu&s;t in the fore|noon drive away the cold from the Ho|rizon, but in the afternoon produceth its heat without any hinderance. This explication doth very well agree with the name, which Seamen give to that time of the Tide, calling it Spring, as if it &s;prung by its own force, and would not be directed by the Moon.</P>
<P>Secondly it is plainly proved that the Moon governeth the Sea, by the Quadruple motion of it, twice to the
<PB N="82" REF="60">
We&s;t, and twice to the Ea&s;t, in 24 hours and 48. min. according to the cour&s;e of the Moon, though our Ma|&s;ter <HI>Herbinius</HI> will not grant that; not thinking there is &s;uch a thing in nature as that the Moon by Antipathy could now in 6 hours and 12 min. drive the Sea from it &s;elf, and afterwards by a Sympathy, in &s;ix other hours attract that again; while&s;t nothing of all this happeneth by Antipathy, in the opini|on of <HI>Herbinius.</HI></P>
<P>For, according to the&s;e principles, the Sea is in a perpetual motion to and fro, as water in a Ve&s;&s;el between its limits, again&s;t which if it beats, it cannot get over; but mu&s;t appea&s;e its proud waves and fall back again; which will la&s;t as long as the world continues. But the God of order that has created and ordained all things according to weight, mea&s;ure, and number, hath made the Moon to govern thereover, not only as a mo|ving cau&s;e with the re&s;t, in the manner afore&s;aid; but al&s;o regulateth its mo|tion according to its own &s;ea&s;ons, and
<PB N="83" REF="60">
the Moon having two Motions, the one from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, together with the Sun, and other Planets and Stars; the other from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, by which it moveth every day u&s;ual|ly 12 degrees, from and to the Sun, which maketh 48 min. of time: &s;o there can be no Antipathy between the Moon and the Motion of the Sea, to what &s;ide &s;oever it turneth it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And God having made the di&s;tance &s;o broad between the Continents, that it can be &s;ix hours falling back from one Land to another, which it would perhaps perform a great deal &s;ooner if it might follow its own pro|pen&s;ion; nay it might well in its fury and rapidity, overwhelm the whole Globe of the Earth, by rea&s;on of the afore&s;aid cau&s;es; therefore the Moon is made to hold back by its cour&s;e that of the Sea, that it may not perfect its motion from one Coa&s;t to another in &s;ix hours or le&s;s, but in &s;ix hours 12 m. which maketh in the four Tides of a day 48. m. &s;o that the Moon gover|neth
<PB N="84" REF="61">
the Sea, as a man doth a running Hor&s;e; &s;ometimes putting him for|wards, &s;ometimes making him go &s;lowly, at other times giving him the Bitt, and &s;ometimes keeping him back; and notwith&s;tanding maketh him &s;o run, that it cometh to his Stage at the appointed time.</P>
<P>This is my poor opinion concern|ing Ebb and Floud, grounded upon my own experience and dilligent en|quiry, whereby, having written it in our <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Tongue, I would &s;pecial|ly give Seamen occa&s;ion to enquire into nature where&s;oever they come, after this manuduction; which if they do, I doubt not, but they &s;hall make &s;uch ob&s;ervations, that this explica|tion will thereby be &s;o confirmed, that it will not be ea&s;ily refuted. We will here tran&s;port us from the &s;alt Sea to the fre&s;h Water on Land, God can never be &s;ufficiently prai&s;|ed, that hath &s;o wonderfully and a|bundantly ble&s;&s;ed that Country with well ta&s;ting and whole&s;ome Fountain Water, Springing &s;ome Fathoms high

what &s;eemeth &s;trange in the beings that God hath created, when rea&s;on cannot comprehend it, is pre&s;ently taken for a miracle, though it be an effect of nature; one may al&s;o ju&s;tly hold this for admirable, that God by his wonderful wi&s;dome and power, hath &s;o ordained it, that the mortal body aggravates the &s;oul, and the earthly Tabernacle oppre&s;&s;eth the wandering &s;en&s;es, &s;o that they &s;carce reach the things which are on earth, and hardly perceive what it hath un|der hand, as the wi&s;e man &s;peaketh, in the ninth Chapter of his Book of <HI>Wi&s;dome;</HI> whence cometh, that ma|ny of the Sons of Men, that will not trouble their Brains with &s;uch deep thoughts, do meerly con&s;ider &s;uch ef|fects of nature as wonders, others give them&s;elves no thoughts at all about them, making u&s;e of them as unrea|&s;onable creatures; others, to whom God and nature hath given more light of under&s;tanding, do not per|&s;i&s;t in &s;earching the &s;ecrets of nature, &s;o as to tire them&s;elves therewith.

from this Fowle is gotten Eider down which the Eider plucks off from its Brea&s;t, and layeth in its ne&s;t about the Eggs, when it hatcheth them, and when they are come out, and are fled away with their dame, this Downe is taken up from the Ne&s;t, being then full of Mo&s;s and Straw; wherefore it is dryed and clean&s;ed over a Basket; the Down which is pluckt off at other times from the Eider is good for no|thing, for it is fat and rotteth. Here is be&s;ides &s;een a &s;trange water Fowl called Imbrim, that is never found on the Land; the Inhabitants take it to be the Halcyon or the Kings Fi&s;her, but it doth not agree with the de&s;cription, which <HI>Francius</HI> hath in his <HI>Hi&s;toria Animalium &s;acra, Chap&punc;</HI> 17. for he writeth, that the Kings Fi&s;her is no bigger then a Spar|row, and is blew, with other of its qualities, that do not at all agree with the properties of this Fowl; for this is bigger then a Goo&s;e, having a long Neck and a pretty long Beak it is grey on the back, checquer'd with white &s;pots, its neck is al&s;o
<PB N="139" REF="90">
grey, &s;omething whiti&s;h down to|wards the brea&s;t, having a white ring about the middle of the neck. The cau&s;e wherefore it is thought to be the Kings Fi&s;her is, they have heard and read, that the Kings Fi&s;her hatcheth its young ones on the Sea, which they believe the Imbrim doth al&s;o, &s;ince it is never found on Land, and can neither come upon it, for its feet &s;tand too much back, and are &s;o weak, that it cannot go with them; be&s;ides, its wings are &s;o little that it cannot fly therewith. In the third place, there are two holes, one under each of its wings, capable to hold an Egg, wherein they &s;uppo&s;e it hatch|eth its eggs, till the young ones come out, neither is it ever &s;een with more or le&s;s then two young ones; which conceit &s;eems not unrea&s;onable, it be|ing po&s;&s;ible that it might be of a lar|ger proportion in cold Countreys then in hot; it is often &s;een near the Land in Harbours, when it is either bad weather or like to be &s;o: and then it cryes out &s;o that one pre&s;ently per|ceiveth
<PB N="146" REF="91">
its arrival; if a man waveth a white linnen to them, the young ones will ea&s;ily be allured to Land that one may &s;hoot them, but the old ones are more wary.</P>
<P>Here cometh al&s;o a water Fowle in Summer, called Liomen, not un|like the Imbrim in bigne&s;s and voice; its legs hang al&s;o back, &s;o that it can|not go, and its wings are &s;o little that it can hardly fly; wherefore when it is on the Land, and men run after it, lit tumbleth over and over, being hardly able to e&s;cape, though it flyeth pretty well when it taketh its flight from the water, &s;pecially when there blow|eth any wind. It maketh its ne&s;t on banks near fre&s;h waters, &s;o clo&s;e to the water that it can drink thereof &s;itting in the Ne&s;t; and if the water encrea&s;eth by rea&s;on of rain, &s;o that it floweth over the eggs it &s;itteth on them, neverthele&s;s, and hatcheth out the young ones. Be&s;ides the&s;e, here cometh al&s;o a rare water Fowle, cal|led Garfugel, but it is &s;eldom found on Clifts under the promontories, it
<PB N="141" REF="91">
hath little wings and cannot fly; it &s;tands upright and goeth like a man, being all over of a &s;hining black co|lour, except under the belly where it is white; it hath a pretty long rai&s;ed Beak though thin toward the &s;ides, having on both &s;ides of its head over the eyes a white round &s;pot as big as a half Crown, &s;howing like a pair of Spectacles: it is not unlike the Bird Pinquin, that is found in <HI>Terra del Fugo,</HI> painted and de&s;cribed in <HI>Atlas minor mercatoris.</HI> I have had that Bird &s;everal times, it is ea&s;ie to be made tame, but cannot live long on Land.</P>
<P>Here cometh al&s;o &s;ome damageable Fowl in the Summer, namely, the Swarth bag, the True, and the Skue. The Swarth bag is a great Bird like a Kite, it is white all over, but the back, where it is black, and therefore is called a Black back, it is of the fi|gure of a Mew, and is al&s;o reckoned among&s;t that &s;ort of Fowl, it hunteth after le&s;&s;er Birds to eat them, and hath nothing ol&s;e worthy of writing&punc;
<PB N="142" REF="92">
The True or Thief is called &s;o, be|cau&s;e it threatneth and &s;tealeth the meat from other Birds; for it hunteth after and&punc; &s;trikes at them till they let the meat fall from their Beaks, and then he catcheth the meat in falling through the air very dexterou&s;ly, and liveth thereby, not being able to plunge in the Water after Fi&s;h; and when it hath gotten &s;omething from the one, he &s;eeketh pre&s;ently ano|ther, continuing &s;o the whole day over.</P>
<P>The Skue is of the &s;ame Species with the True, but &s;omething larger as big as a Raven, being very fierce in the defence of its Eggs and young ones, &s;o that if a man comes by its ne&s;t, he mu&s;t take a care of him&s;elf, for it flyeth &s;treight ways at his head, and &s;trikes him cruelly with his wings; wherefore the Inhabitants that know the temerity of it; fa&s;ten a knife up|right on their head again&s;t it, and it happeneth often that in falling with vehemence on the man, it is run through with the knife, and falleth

<P>The profitable Water Fowls, that come hither in Summer, are Wild-Gee&s;e, which are of three &s;orts; or|dinary grey Gee&s;e, reddi&s;h Gee&s;e, and Hel&s;in Gee&s;e, that are le&s;s then ordinary Grey Gee&s;e, coming hither in great numbers, and keeping them|&s;elves in great Lakes of fre&s;h Water. When they Mew, the Inhabitants go &s;ometimes on Goo&s;e Hunting with little Boats on the &s;aid Lakes, taking &s;ometimes a great &s;tore of them. Swans come al&s;o hither in the Spring, but they only re&s;t them&s;elves and pro|ceed &s;treight on their way to other Countreys. But &s;pecially there co|meth hither in the Spring in great numbers, to the Inhabitants great pro|fit and advantage, &s;ome other &s;orts of Birds good to be eaten; among&s;t which the fir&s;t is principally worth taking notice of; it is called Sule, and is found no where in <HI>Feroe,</HI> but on the I&s;let or <HI>Myggone&s;s,</HI> whereof the Inha|bitants

have yearly a great help to their hou&s;e keeping, they rehear&s;e a &s;trange Fable of the rea&s;on, where|fore that Fowl is only found there, and no where el&s;e, whereof we will &s;peak in another place. The Sule is a pretty great Fowl being of a blew|i&s;h gray, it is al&s;o found in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and is called by Seamen, a Gentle|man.</P>
<P>The other eatable Sea Fowls are found in great quantities every where in the Land, namely, the Skrabe, Lunde, Lomvifve, and the Sea-Daw. The Skrabe cometh in <HI>February,</HI> a|bout St. <HI>Matthews</HI> day, and fareth a|way about St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Tide. The Lomvifve and Sea-daw come about St. <HI>Gregories</HI> Tide, and fly away at <HI>Mary Magdelens;</HI> The&s;e Daws are none of tho&s;e that are &s;o frequent in <HI>Denmark,</HI> tho&s;e being Land Birds, that are &s;een here al&s;o, though very &s;eldome. The afore&s;aid &s;orts of Birds lay every one but&punc; one Egg, and get but one young every year, and though they be tho&s;e that chiefly are &s;ought

for, and there be well taken of them a hundred thou&s;and every year, there is neverthele&s;s more of them then of any other &s;ort; yea, by the admirable providence of God, they are &s;o plen|tiful, that they in clear weather can darken the &s;hining of the Sun. as it were with a thick Cloud, making &s;uch a terrible noi&s;e and &s;ound with their wings in flying, that they, who hear it, and do not know the cau&s;e thereof, would not think otherwi&s;e, but that it were thunder. Every one of the&s;e Birds builds its ne&s;t, and brings forth its young ones in a particular man|ner.</P>
<P>The Skrabe builds on the Land un|der the Earth, &s;craping with its Beak and Claws, lying on the back, whence it is called Skrabe, it diggeth under ground in &s;ome places a foot deep, in &s;ome other eight or ten foot in &s;everal turnings, &s;eeking &s;pecially to dig it &s;elf behind a &s;tone, where it thinketh to lye &s;ure&s;t. It breedeth as afore|&s;aid, but one young: it being remark|able, that this Bird is the whole day

away from its young, and never comes to it, but in the night to feed it, and if it flies not from its young at the dawning of the day, it &s;tayeth with it the whole day over, till the night comes, and then flyeth out to Sea, till the other night cometh; and though the young is fed but once a day, yet it is &s;o fat, that no Goo&s;e, though it have been three weeks fat|ned, can be fatter: and they call tho&s;e young ones lyers, they do not by rea|&s;on of their fatne&s;s, make pre&s;ent u&s;e of the&s;e young ones, but &s;alt them to eat them in Winter; melting their fat, which they burn in Lamps. They have to take them out &s;everal hooks half an Ell or an Ell long, where|with they pierce them through, and draw them out. They do not u&s;ually take the Dame her &s;elf, except &s;he be &s;ometimes hurt with the hook, &s;o that &s;he cannot live; but if they cannot get the young one with their hook, or by thru&s;ting their arm into the Birds Ne&s;t, by rea&s;on of the many turnings, they dig a hole down unto

it, as near as they can gue&s;s, and then thru&s;t about with their hooks till they can get it; which hole they mu&s;t again &s;top &s;o clo&s;e that not one drop of wa|ter can come into it, for el&s;e &s;he will for&s;ake her hole, and never come thi|ther more; which otherwi&s;e &s;he doth every year in the wonted place; &s;o that the Inhabitants know in what place under the Earth they can every year find that Bird.</P>
<P>The Lunde is a little Bird, &s;ome|thing bigger then a Pidgeon, whereof there is a va&s;t multitue; It hath a &s;trong crooked Beak, &s;o that if it bi|teth a man in the hand, it teareth off the Fle&s;h; having al&s;o &s;harp Claws. It wageth War with the Raven, that cometh and will take it away, and its young ones; It being a wonderful &s;pectacle to &s;ee their fight, for as &s;oon as the Raven cometh near, the Lunde catcheth it under the throat with its Beak, and gra&s;peth it about the Brea&s;t with its Claws, &s;o that the Raven cannot hurt it, but mu&s;t fly a|way with a great crying; the Lunde

holds it fa&s;t in the mean time without letting it go, till they come into the Sea, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lipping it, it is drowned. Yet the Raven doth often take the Lunde at unawares, ru&s;heth into its hole, takes it and eats it up. The &s;aid Bird, the Lunde, buildeth its Ne&s;t &s;ometimes on the Continent, far from hou&s;es, digging it &s;elf two or three yards, according to the nature of the place, under ground, lying on its back as the Scrape, &s;ometimes in Ures (that are places under high Clifts, full of great and &s;mall &s;tones, that fall from the Clifts, and by length of time, are filled between with Earth, and covered with Gra&s;s) in which places they dig them&s;elves in|to the Earth, or build where there is no earth, their ne&s;t under and between Stones, where they can come to breed their young with mo&s;t &s;ecu|rity.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part being taken in &s;uch places, &s;o that man can often take above an hundred Lundes in one Ure; &s;ome of them build on the &s;ide

The Lundes that make their Ne&s;ts in the Fields, are taken as is &s;aid, above of the <HI>Skrabe;</HI> but for &s;uch as are under tho&s;e many &s;tones, they let run unto them &s;ome little Dogs, that are &s;o taught, which bring out both Bird and Egg to their Ma&s;ters; but when the Birds are fled, the men take them flying, which is done in this manner: they have a long Pole at the end of which there is a hoop drawn over with a net, whereof the ma&s;hes are almo&s;t as big as the quarrels of a Gla&s;s Window, being like the Net, wherewith they take Shrimps in &s;ome places; and this they call a Stang of Staffe; with this Staffe the Fowler &s;it|teth on the Clift, or in the Ures be|tween the the great Stones, where he knoweth mo&s;t Fowl to come, which they call flight places; and when the

Lunde cometh flying either from or to the Land, he lifts up the Staff and the Net again&s;t the Fowle, and when he hath got it into the Net, he turn|eth the Staffe about, that it may in|tangle it &s;elf the better therein; a man being &s;ometimes able in that manner to take 200 Lundes in very &s;hort time, be&s;ides tho&s;e that are ta|ken in their Ne&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Lumwifve is a pretty great Bird, wherefore they are generally called great Fowls; it is black on the back and white under the belly. The Daw is &s;omething bigger then the Jack-dawes they have in <HI>Denmark,</HI> being al&s;o black on the back and white under the brea&s;t, having white &s;troaks about the Jaws, and a &s;harp pointed Beak. It hatcheth its young ones in holes and &s;hinks of high Promontories, but the Lumwifve layeth her eggs on the bare points and Clifts, that are many in the &s;aid Promontories, there lying &s;ometimes on the&s;e Clifts &s;ome hundred Eggs ac|cording as the place is large, but three

&s;he &s;eeks the &s;ame place where &s;he fate before, and clacketh &s;o long till her young one cometh to her, be|ing very well able to di&s;cern its own Dame, though they be all &s;hap'd a|like; and when &s;he giveth her young to eat, &s;he putteth her head back un|der her wing, giving it &s;o to eat back|wards.</P>
<P>It cannot be expre&s;t with what pain and danger they take the&s;e Birds, in tho&s;e high and &s;teep clifts, whereof many are above 200 Fathom high; there being men apt by nature and fit for that work, called Fowlers, who take them u&s;ually in two manners; for either they climb from below up into the&s;e high Promontories, that are as &s;teep as a wall, or they let them&s;elves down into them from a|bove, with a thick, &s;trong, hemp-rope, when they climb from below, they have then a pole five or &s;ix ells long, with an iron hook at the end, which they tha are below in the Boat, or on the Clift, fa&s;ten unto the mans Gir|dle, or another Rope that the Fow|ler

hath about him, helping him thus up to the highe&s;t place, where he can get footing: afterwards they al|&s;o help up another man, and when there are &s;o, &s;everal come up, every one with his Fowling Staffe in his hand, and the long Rope between them tyed to each others wa&s;t, they climb &s;o as high as po&s;&s;ible they can; and where they find difficulty they help each other up by thru&s;ting one another under the breech with their Poles: and when the fir&s;t hath taken footing, he draweth the other up to him by the Rope fa&s;tned to his wa&s;t, and &s;o they proceed on till they come to the place where the Birds build; going then after them about the hill as they plea&s;e, and there being many dangerous glaces to climb about, ha|ving hound them&s;elves at the Ropes end, the one &s;eeketh a convenient place where he can &s;tand &s;ure and hold him&s;elf fa&s;t, while&s;t the other goeth about the&s;e dangerous places; if it then happen, that he chanceth to fall, the other that &s;tands firm keeps

<P>Mr. <HI>Peter Clau&s;on</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Norway</HI> writeth, that there was anciently a Law in the Countrey that who&s;oever climbed &s;o on the Clifts, that he fell down and dyed, if the body was found to be buried, his next Kin&s;man &s;hould go the &s;ame way; but if he dur&s;t or could not do it, the dead was not then to be buried in Sanctified earth, as one that had been too full of temerity, and was his own bane. But there is found nothing of that Law now adays.</P>
<P>When they then are come, in the manner afore&s;aid, to the birds, within
<PB N="155" REF="98">
the Clifts where they &s;eldome come, the Birds are &s;o tame that they can take them with their hands, for they will hardly leave their young ones; but where they are Wild, they either ca&s;t the net over them on the Clift; and again&s;t tho&s;e that either fly from thence or thereunto, they oppo&s;e the Fowling Staffe with its net, and in|tangle them therein. In which man|ner they take a great multitude of <HI>Lumwifves,</HI> Daws and Lunds. In the mean time there lyeth a Boat beneath on the Sea, wherein they ca&s;t their birds kill'd; and in this manner they can in a &s;hort time fill a Boat with Fowl. When it is pretty fair wea|ther and there is good Fowling, the Fowlers &s;tay in the Clifts &s;even or eight days together, for there are here and there holes in the Rocks, where they can &s;afely re&s;t, and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top of the Mountain.

Some Rocks are &s;o difficult, that they can in no manner get unto them from below, wherefore they &s;eek to come down thereunto from above, which they call to Sie, and is the &s;e|cond manner to pur&s;ue birds, being performed in this manner: They have a Rope 80 or 100 Fathoms long, and three Fingers thick, the fowler ma|keth the end thereof fa&s;t about his wa&s;te, and between his legs, &s;o that he can &s;it thereon, and thus is let down, with the Fowling Staffe in his hand; &s;ix men hold by the Rope and let him ea&s;ily down, laying a piece of wood on the brink of the Rock, upon which the Rope glideth, that it may not be worn to pieces by the hard and rough edge of the &s;tone: They have be&s;ides another &s;maller line that is fa&s;tened to the Fowlers body, on which he pulleth, to give them notice how they &s;hould let down the great Rope, either low|er or higher, or to hold &s;till, that he may &s;tay in the place whereunto he is come; here the man is in great

<P>AS the Ju&s;tice of God for the Sins of men hath deprived ma|ny places of his ble&s;&s;ings in their wa|ters, he hath done the like for the &s;ins of the people of <HI>Feroe;</HI> for in former times Fi&s;hing hath been &s;o abundant, that the Inhabitants could maintain them&s;elves with it alone; but it is now &s;o dimini&s;hed, that &s;ome years they cannot fi&s;h for their own cor|poral nece&s;&s;ities; &s;o that the poor|e&s;t &s;ort that have no Lands to Till, &s;uffer &s;ometimes great indigency.

and knowing that the nature of this people is not to deal with too much riches and opulency, without abu|&s;ing thereof, he taketh care they &s;hould not have &s;atiety of all things at one time, for it is plainly percei|ved, that when he crowneth the land with abundancy, the Fi&s;hes are dri|ven from their Seas, and contrary|wi&s;e, when he taketh away the bea&s;ts of the Fields, he giveth them very a|bundant fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hes wherewith this people maintain them&s;elves are of three &s;orts; fir&s;t, &s;mall Fi&s;hes, &s;econdly Seals, and in the third place Whales.</P>

<P>Cods are u&s;ually found in certain places of the Sea called Meads, ha|ving a certain time when they come and when they go away. The&s;e pla|ces are well known to the Inhabitants by the Points of Land, whence they take their di&s;tance to come to the right place, wherefore they call it Meade or Mea&s;ure; The&s;e places be|ing u&s;ually grounds, where it is thought there are Springs of fre&s;h water, by rea&s;on whereof tho&s;e fi|&s;hes like to be in &s;uch places.

<P>The third manner is very remarka|ble, and is called to go on Later, this word Later is not a Latine Word, but an old word of the Language of <HI>Feroe,</HI> &s;ignifying as much as coupling, for when the Kobs are coupled toge|ther, they call it then properly at La|teris. For here are many hollow places, from the Sea into the rocks, being large and wide cavities, as great Vaulted Cellars, before which there is a little hole, as a door, &s;o that a &s;mall Boat can go into them; within the hole the water is deep, &s;o that one can yet go farther in with the boat, but it becometh &s;hallower and &s;hallower; and at la&s;t is dry ground, with a &s;pacious Vault, &s;o that there is a great Eccho within when any body &s;peaketh, being &s;o dark there, that one cannot di&s;cern whether it be day or night.</P>
<P>The Kobs have their habitation in
<PB N="168" REF="105">
the&s;e Vaults or Caves, &s;ometimes a|bove 100 together; and becau&s;e the Inhabitants are of opinion that they couple therein, they do therefore call them Later, and to &s;eek tho&s;e holes to kill the Kobs, is called by them, to go on Later, The&s;e Caves are of two &s;orts, whereof the ones entrance is under water, where no man can come in, and is called Kaufve-Later becau&s;e the Seals dive under water when they goe into them&punc; the other who&s;e Orifice is above water. The Pea&s;ants have particular &s;mall boats to go into the&s;e Caves with, where|fore when they know that the young Seales are great and fat, they go with their Boats into the Cave, ha|ving u&s;ually two Boats, with the one of which they get in, the other &s;taying without at the entrance, ha|ving between the Boats a Tow of 80 Fathoms length or larger, that if the Boat which goeth farthe&s;t in, be fill'd with water, as it often happeneth, the other, that is at the entrance, may pull it out with the people in it; and
<PB N="169" REF="105">
the Cave being narrow, they have a pointed &s;take on each &s;ide, wherewith they thru&s;t them&s;elves in: They have al&s;o two Candles in the Boat, that they may the better &s;ee to kill the Kobs, it being &s;o dark within; The &s;aid Candles are as thick as a mans arm, and they hide them in the Boat, lea&s;t the Seales &s;hould &s;ee the men be|fore they come on dry ground. When they are come &s;o far in the Cave that they can feel ground, which they try with their pointed Staves, fir&s;t one Man leapeth out from the Boat in|to the water, as deep as he can wade, having a club in his hand to fell the Kob with, which they call Kob gra&s;s then leaps the &s;econd man after him, having a Candle in each hand, which he mu&s;t hold over his head that they be not put out with the water, after them cometh the third man, that hath al&s;o a felling Club to &s;trike with, when the Seals lying on dry ground, begin to &s;ee the Light and men, they will flee to Sea, wherefore the
<PB N="170" REF="106">
old ones ri&s;e them&s;elves on their paws with their Jaws open directly again&s;t the man, &s;pecially if it be a He, for then he will not flee from the man, but the man mu&s;t avoid him, and when he &s;trikes at him he meeteth the blow with his jaws, &s;natching the Club from the mans hands, and ca|&s;ting it on that &s;ide, where there is no body. Then comes the other man with his Club, and &s;trikes him over the neck, but if it be a Shee, &s;he is not &s;o fierce, and fleeth from the man if &s;he can. When they hit them right o|ver the head, they fall down in a &s;ound and then the men are pre&s;ently ready &s;o cut their throats. When they have done &s;o with all the old, they come to the young ones that lye all &s;till, far from the water, and never take notice of men nor light, till they come and kill them; when the &s;laughter is fini&s;h'd, they hale the dead Kobs to the Water &s;ide, and tye them fa&s;t to the Rope, wherewith tho&s;e in the Boat without pull them to them. La&s;t of all the men get out with the Boat that

In this manner they get &s;ome|times many Seals, often half a hun|dred in one Cave, the old Kobs are as big as an Ox or Cow, and &s;o fat, that one can get three Loads of Fat from them; they u&s;e their skins for Shooes, and eat the fle&s;h of them: they melt the Fat into Train Oyle, and &s;alt a part thereof to eat.</P>
<P>There are found &s;everal &s;orts of Whales under this Land, among&s;t which there cometh one &s;ort, cal|led Grind-Whale; Grind according to the explication of Mr. <HI>Peter Clau|&s;on</HI> &s;ignifieth all &s;ort of grates or Trel|lices, either of Iron or Wood, and be|cau&s;e this &s;ort of Whale &s;wimmeth &s;ide to &s;ide by one another, when they go on coupling, &s;uch a Flock of Whales is called a Whales Grind. The&s;e Grind-Whales are not great, the bigge&s;t being but five ells long, and the young ones an ell and a half, they come in great Flocks under the
<PB N="172" REF="107">
Land, when it is dark or foggy wea|ther, &s;o that they cannot &s;ee it; which is therefore called Grind-weather. When the Inhabitants are out about their Fi&s;hing, and &s;ee a Flock of Whales, tho&s;e that &s;ee them fir&s;t call and make &s;igns to the other Boats that are about them, who leaving their fi&s;hing, come pre&s;ently together, and go to the Whales, to drive them in towards the Land; but when the Whales will turn back towards the Sea, they cry out and make the mo&s;t noi&s;e they can in the Boat, throwing &s;tones and what el&s;e they can find at them, till the Whales turn again, and then when God giveth his ble&s;&s;ing, they can drive them where they plea&s;e as if it were a Flock of Sheep or Cat|tle. When they come to Land they &s;end a man or two to give notice e|very where, and this me&s;&s;enger mu&s;t go &s;peedily day and night, and is cal|led Grind-me&s;&s;age. Tho&s;e then that get notice of it pre&s;ently, kindle a brand on a certain place, that they on the next I&s;land where the me&s;&s;age
<PB N="173" REF="107">
is not come, may get timely notice of it, who can know by the place whence the Fire or Smoak ari&s;eth, what it &s;ignifieth: whereupon there cometh &s;peedily a great number of Folks together, &s;ome by Land and &s;ome by Water, having their Whale Spears with them. When they have then brought as many Boats together as they think needful, they drive the Whales into an Inlet, or Creek, where they know there are good Whale-banks, and flat &s;andy grounds, whereon they drive the Whales, with great crying, noi&s;e, and ca&s;ting of Stones, driving them as fa&s;t as they can upon the Sands; then if it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, the Boats divide them&s;elves into two companies, the one lying below in the form of a half Moon, to meet the Whale if it wou d flee away during the &s;laughter, the other ad|vancing into the mid&s;t of the Whale Flock, thru&s;ting their Whale Spears into their bodies; in the mean time &s;ome of the people lye in an ambu&s;h on the Land, till the Whales are come
<PB N="174" REF="108">
on ground, and wade to them as deep as they can, and then kill them chief|ly with their Weapons, with &s;uch fu|ry on both &s;ides, that the water be|cometh as red as blood; whereby the Whale is al&s;o blinded, &s;o that it can|not &s;ee to run away; it is a &s;trange thing, to &s;ee that the&s;e &s;trong creatures make no re&s;i&s;tance, but only plunge as well as they can before the boats, and people, till death cometh upon them, and then they &s;trike terribly about with their Tayles, &s;o that they beat &s;ometimes the boats to pieces, and the men come in danger, if they do not know how to have a care of them. Some of them get again loo&s;e from the Sands, and carry &s;ometimes the boats a great way with them on their backs, over-turn|ing them here and there and &s;triking them full of water, yet tho&s;e that are below drive them in again, but if they are not able to force them thereunto, the re&s;t come to their help, &amp; &s;o make them return, though it happeneth al|&s;o &s;ometimes, that they will at la&s;t

<P>When they have killed as many as they can get, which la&s;teth well a whole day or longer, they hale them on Land, and tho&s;e that are killed at Sea float up the next day, and are al|&s;o driven thither. When all the Whales are thus brought on dry ground, and are toll'd, fir&s;t the Tithes are taken of them, then the Finding-Whale for him that &s;aw them fir&s;t; the re&s;t being divided into two parts, the one whereof belongs to the people that took them, and the other part to the owner of the Land under which they are taken, whether it be the Kings, &s;ome Noblemans, or be|longs

<P>As we have &s;aid before, the&s;e Whales have &s;hort heads, and little eyes, they have a black skin with a white &s;troke under the belly, and are pretty fat; they have a palm thick of fat, the head is almo&s;t no|thing but fat, they partly melt the

They dry and eat the fle&s;h when it is fre&s;h, the &s;ame looking and &s;melling as Beef; and what they cannot &s;traight con&s;ume they cut into long &s;egments and hang it up to dry in the wind, con&s;uming it afterwards in time, as other &s;moak|ed fle&s;h. Forreigners &s;ometimes pickle &s;omething of the tayl, which ta&s;teth very like neats feet, wherefore the Inhabitants take the&s;e Whales to be, and call them Sea kine.</P>

Mr. <HI>Peter Clau&s;on</HI> writeth in his De&s;cription of <HI>Norway,</HI> that the&s;e Whales are driven in by a Whale-Dog, whereof I have often enquired, but could never get any certain know|ledge of it; yet I cannot ab&s;tain from informing the curious Reader, of what is at la&s;t come to my knowledge. It happened in the year 1664, when there came many Whales in <HI>Skaale|&s;ord,</HI> about Harve&s;t, as afore&s;aid, that when the greate&s;t part of the Whales were killed, there appeared a Sea Mon&s;ter &s;wimming about the Whales, between them and the Land, that was in every manner like a Dog, as for tho&s;e parts that were above water, it was of a grey colour, hairy, with long ears like an Engli&s;h rough Spaniel, this hath been told me by men worthy of credit, and the fame of it grew common over the whole Country, <HI>John Theodore de Bry</HI> in his de&s;cription of the We&s;t India Voya|ges, writeth that there is a &s;ort of Sea Dogs found in the <HI>Magellanick</HI> Streights, that are hairy on their fore|parts

to the midde&s;t of their body, with &s;hort ears, as one u&s;es to cut tho&s;e of rough Dogs, or like Lyons, their fore feet being like the hands of men, and their hinder parts like a Fi&s;h: They are great and terrible to look on, whence one may finally conclude that there are &s;uch Whale Dogs, though I cannot decide whe|ther they be of the &s;ame &s;ort with tho&s;e that are in the We&s;t Indies; There are doubtle&s;s more Sea Mon|&s;ters yet, then have been known hi|therto.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o taken another &s;ort of Whales, which they call Doglings, and are u&s;ually found in one Haven of this Country, namely, that of <HI>Qualboe</HI> in <HI>Suderoe,</HI> and &s;eldome in <HI>Vaage</HI> in the &s;ame I&s;land, and that u|&s;ually in Autumn, three, or four, or &s;ix almo&s;t every year, and if they fail one year there comes the next year twice as many; they are 7 or 8 els long, and very thick, being about 2 ells broad, where they are thicke&s;t. They are taken in a very &s;trange man|ner;
<PB N="180" REF="111">
for when the people perceive them without the Inlet, they row out to them with &s;ome Roaps in their Boats. If it be bad weather, &s;o that they cannot come near them, they drive them into the Inlet, as they u&s;e to do with tho&s;e called Grinds. But if it be calm weather, they row clo&s;e to the Whale, that lyeth there &s;till by the Boat, thinking it perhaps to be its Mate: In the mean time they pierce a hole in the fat of its eye lid, wherein they fa&s;ten the Rope; the piercing whereof hurteth it not, but only tickleth it, wherefore it &s;uffereth the &s;ame willingly; when they have thus fa&s;tened the Rope, they row to a Sandy Bank, whither it &s;uffereth it &s;elf ea&s;ily to be drawn, and the re&s;t follow after, till they are all gotten on the &s;and, and then in like manner they make the Rope fa&s;t to the other Whales, tying the other end fa&s;t to &s;ome &s;tones on Land, and la&s;tly row out to them with their Boats, piercing them with their Whale-Spears, till they lo&s;e their blood and dye; but
<PB N="181" REF="111">
then the men mu&s;t retire and have a care of them&s;elves, for they beat then terribly about them.</P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>John Theodore de Bry</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of the We&s;t Indies relateth, that the Indians on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Flo|rida</HI> take Whales in this manner; when any one &s;ees the Whale on ground, they row to it with a Boat, having a &s;trong Rope with them with two &s;takes on both ends; when the American cometh to the Whale, he climbs upon it, and &s;trikes fir&s;t the one &s;take into the Pipe through which it draweth breath and blow|eth up water, driving al&s;o the other &s;take through the other hole; where|by the Whale is choaked at la&s;t, and when it is dead, there comes more people to help him to draw it on land. This manner &s;eemeth &s;trange, but ours in <HI>Feroe</HI> is no le&s;s wonderful. The fle&s;h and the fat of the&s;e Dog|lings are not good to eat, for if one eateth thereof, it pierceth through the pores, &s;o that ones clothes look yellow and &s;mell of it, the Oyl thereof

<P>Here is related a &s;trange &s;tory about it, which can be accounted but for a Fable; They &s;ay, it happened once during the darkne&s;s of Pagani&s;m, when <HI>Feroe</HI> was fir&s;t inhabited by men, that a Gyant under took to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the I&s;land of <HI>Myg|gene&s;s,</HI> a Sorcerer dwelling on the land would hinder him, wherefore the man did often fight with the Sorcerer, and at la&s;t vanqui&s;hed him; wherefore the Sorcerer made an agreement with him, that if he would not de&s;troy him, but let him have his habitation in the I&s;land, he would yearly pro|cure him a &s;ort of Whales and Fowl in the Land, which were not gotten in other places of <HI>Feroe;</HI> and that for him and his Succe&s;&s;ors as long as the world &s;hould la&s;t; though with this
<PB N="183" REF="112">
condition, that if any one mocked or derided his Whale, it &s;hould ne|ver come any more: which conditi|on the man accepted, and &s;ince that time there came yearly a particular &s;ort of Whale under the Land; as the Inhabitants relate and have by relati|on of their Predece&s;&s;ours, the &s;aid Whale had but one eye; finally it happened that an indi&s;creet man, be|ing weary of the labour he had every year by rea&s;on of that Whale, did contemn it, for having but one eye, wherefore it never came there &s;ince; the Inhabitants believing it removed thence to <HI>Qualboe</HI> in <HI>Suderoe,</HI> they alone, and almo&s;t every year having them, though they have two eyes as other great Fi&s;hes. The Fowl where|with the Sorcerer did pre&s;ent <HI>Myggy|ne&s;s,</HI> is the &s;ule de&s;cribed above: which is neither found any where in this Country except there; this is &s;old for the price it co&s;t.

<P>The Inhabitants receive al&s;o &s;ome|times a con&s;iderable profit from the Whales that are pierced at Sea, which come &s;ometimes floating hither to the Land.</P>
<P>Here are be&s;ides &s;een under the Land great living Whales, as the Roar and Witch-Whale, on which the Inhabitants dare not venture. The Roar is very great and long, and the Witch-Whale very dangerous; for it will play with Boats: &s;ometimes it ri&s;eth from under the water under the Boat, &s;o that it &s;tandeth fa&s;t on its back as upon a Rock, which often bringeth the people in great danger. But God and Nature have revealed them a &s;trange &s;ecret means to drive away &s;uch dangerous Mon&s;ters, name|ly, <HI>Ca&s;toreum,</HI> which u&s;ually they carry in the head of their Boat, boar|ing
<PB N="185" REF="113">
a hole in the Wood, and putting <HI>Ca&s;toreum</HI> in it, which they &s;top af|terwards with a peg; others have it inclo&s;ed in a piece of wood, where|unto they link their Fi&s;h lines, and carry it always with them in the Boat; and when the Witch-Whale comes under &s;uch a Boat, or that they ca&s;t that piece of wood upon it, it &s;inketh to the bottome as a Stone. This Whale mu&s;t have a very good &s;cent, and cannot &s;uffer the &s;mell of <HI>Ca&s;toreum,</HI> wherefore it retireth pre|&s;ently to the deep.

The cau&s;e of its inhabitation being this; It hap|pened that <HI>Harold Haldan&s;on Pulchri|comus,</HI> principal Ne&s;s or Promontory, King in <HI>Norway,</HI> beginning to reduce the Kingdom under him, made War upon the Inhabitants upward of 10 years, from the year of Chri&s;t 858 to 868, and having during that time put to death a part of tho&s;e little Kings and Princes, reduced a part of them under him&s;elf, driven another part out of the Land, and the la&s;t year, &s;ome Kings and principal men having made alli|ance to re&s;i&s;t him, and rai&s;ed a great Army, King <HI>Harold</HI> de&s;troyed their Forces; after which time he found no more re&s;i&s;tance in <HI>Norway,</HI> and then &s;aiih the Hi&s;tory, namely, the Chronicles of <HI>Norway page.</HI> 49, ma|ny de&s;ert Lands were inhabited, which the men of <HI>Norway</HI> had begun to frequent before, <HI>Jempteland, I&s;land, Grkeney, Hotland,</HI> and <HI>Feroe</HI> were in|habited; for many rich and oppulent

<P>I mu&s;t add my opinion concerning the Etymology of that name, and me|thinks the land may have taken its name from the Word to <HI>Fare,</HI> which is the &s;ame in the ancient Language of <HI>Feroe,</HI> as <HI>Ferrie</HI> in Engli&s;h, the &s;ame being al&s;o us'd in our old Dani&s;h; for places in <HI>Denmark,</HI> where one cro&s;&s;eth from one &s;hoar to the other in Boats or Ferries, are called Fer|ry places, from ancient time to this pre&s;ent: and <HI>Feroe</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of many I&s;lands, where one not only mu&s;t

cro&s;s with Boats and Ferries, called in that Tongue <HI>Faevinger,</HI> from one Land to another, but one can al&s;o with &s;uch Boats go along between the I&s;lands; it &s;eems probable that this qualificati|on of the land may have given <HI>Gri|mar Camban</HI> occa&s;ion at his arrival to call the&s;e I&s;lands <HI>Feroier,</HI> as they are called to this day in the language of <HI>Feroe,</HI> I leave herein neverthele&s;s e|very one to his own opinion; but the I&s;lands being many, they ought to be called the <HI>Feroes,</HI> as they are <HI>Feroier</HI> by the Inhabitants, and in Latine <HI>Fe|roae,</HI> as the <HI>Oreades, Canaries,</HI> and o|ther Provinces that con&s;i&s;t of many I&s;lands.</P>

For as this Bi&s;hop <HI>Roar</HI> is not found in the de|&s;cription of <HI>Norway</HI> among&s;t the Bi|&s;hops of <HI>Feroe,</HI> in the Catalogue, and the Hi&s;torian hath neither mentioned that this Bi&s;hop was the fir&s;t, nor when or by whom he was e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o the Author hath neither cared for, when <HI>Feroe</HI> was laid under the Crown of <HI>Norway,</HI> as a thing which did not properly belong to the &s;cope of his Treati&s;e. <HI>Feroe</HI> having ever &s;ince the time mentioned been a Province &s;ub|ject to the Kingdom of <HI>Norway,</HI> it hath not only happened, that the principal men thereof, as Members of that Kingdom, have been made u&s;e of in bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of great impor|tance, as we read in the Chronicle of <HI>Norway, pag</HI> 635. that in King <HI>Ha|gen Hagen&s;ens</HI> time, who was King <HI>Suerres</HI> Grandchild, <HI>Swerke</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Feroe</HI> was with others in the A&s;&s;em|bly of the States in the year of Chri&s;t 1223. when King <HI>Hagen Hagen&s;on</HI> was by all the States &s;worn and jud|ged

to be the true Heir of the King|dom of <HI>Norway;</HI> but they have al&s;o as faithful &s;ubjects received Ju&s;tice from the Kings of <HI>Norway</HI> in doubt|ful cau&s;es, as appeareth by a parti|cular Law, called <HI>Soide-Breffvet,</HI> or an ordinance about Sheep, declaring how one mu&s;t deal therewith, that the one may not wrong the other.</P>
<P>There is a great errour in the date thereof, mentioning it to be given at <HI>Op&s;lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> in the year of Chri&s;t 1040. which time is but a &s;hort while after <HI>Charles the Tender</HI> was kill'd in <HI>Feroe,</HI> whereas it hath been proved that <HI>Fe|roe</HI> was not then under the Kings of <HI>Norway.</HI> And this error is not only proved hereby, but al&s;o by the&s;e ar|guments. Fir&s;t, it is mentioned in the Sheep Ordinance, that it was <HI>Hagen</HI> Duke of <HI>Norway,</HI> King <HI>Magnus</HI> the Crowned Son that gave it out; and there is found no King <HI>Magnas</HI> before then, till the time of King <HI>Magnus Oluff&s;on.</HI> The fir&s;t King <HI>Magnus</HI> that was Crowned, was King <HI>Magnus Erling&s;on,</HI> who reigned in the year
<PB N="216" REF="130">
of Chri&s;t 1164. and had one Son cal|led <HI>Hagen,</HI> neither did any of his Children rule in <HI>Norway,</HI> being him|&s;elf kill'd by <HI>Suerre,</HI> and all his Pro|geny driven out and de&s;troyed. Se|condly, there is named in the Sheep-Ordinance, Bi&s;hop <HI>Erlander,</HI> who in the Catalogue of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Feroe,</HI> is the third after <HI>Suerquire,</HI> of whom is &s;aid above, that he was in the year 1223. in the general A&s;&s;embly of the States, whence it plainly appeareth, that there is a great errour in the time it was given out.</P>
<P>But that we may come to &s;ome cer|tainty about the date of this Sheep-Ordinance, we find in Hi&s;tory that King <HI>Magnus Hagen&s;on Lagebetter,</HI> who Reigned over <HI>Norway</HI> in the year 1263. had two Sons, <HI>Erick</HI> and <HI>Ha|gen; Erick</HI> became King after his Father, and was called <HI>Erick</HI> Prie&s;t|hater, who reigned 19 years, and died in the year 1299. In this King <HI>Ericks</HI> 19 years reign, his Brother <HI>Hagen</HI> was as a Duke in <HI>Norway,</HI> though Hi|&s;tory doth not &s;peak plainly of it;
<PB N="217" REF="130">
yet it can be ea&s;ily concluded by the circum&s;tances; for antiently, &s;ince the time of <HI>Harolds Pulchricomus,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Norway</HI>'s Sons were called Graves or Earls; but <HI>Hagen Hagen|&s;on,</HI> the Father of King <HI>Magnus</HI> the Crowned, brought fir&s;t the Title of Duke over into <HI>Norway;</HI> making his Queen's Father, who was before an Earl or Count, to be a Duke. Af|ter which the Title of Duke was e|ver given to the Kings Sons; whence it appeareth that this Sheep Ordinance was given out in the 19 year of that Duke, when his Brother <HI>Erick</HI> dyed, and he became King; that is in the year 1299.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of Hi&s;tory does much confirm this opinion in other manner, for as Duke <HI>Hagen</HI> calls him|&s;elf, for Honors &s;ake, the &s;on of King <HI>Magnus</HI> the Crowned, &s;o there are none of the former Kings &s;o remarka|ble by their Coronation as this King <HI>Magnus,</HI> who was Crowned during his Fathers Life, without any contra|diction, but rather with the de&s;ire of
<PB N="218" REF="131">
all; which never happened before: for which rea&s;on it may be, he was called King <HI>Magnus</HI> the Crowned. This King <HI>Magnus</HI> bettered the Law, wherefore he was called Law-better|er. He writ al&s;o a particular law for tho&s;e of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> as al&s;o the Ordinance of Chri&s;tianity, which was &s;ent over to tho&s;e of <HI>Feroe;</HI> whereupon it &s;eems they found &s;omething to complain of, as appeareth by the Proeme to the Sheep-Ordinance, of which it &s;eems tho&s;e of <HI>Feroe</HI> took then occa&s;ion to de&s;ire of his Son that particular ordi|nance concerning Sheep; much mi&s;|demeanour being u&s;ed therein, which had in that long &s;pace crept among&s;t the commonalty; of which law we will further &s;peak in the &s;ixth Chap|ter, when we treat of their Policy.</P>
<P>This ordinance concerning Sheep was confirmed by <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the IV. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> of happy Memory, and Printed upon the humble de&s;ires of the Inhabitants of <HI>Feroe,</HI> though this fault was left uncorrected; but this mu&s;t be imputed to the &s;imple

hath the Turk forgotten it; for in the year 1629. there came two Turki&s;h Ships into <HI>Suderoe,</HI> that dealt very cruelly in the Countrey, taking away without exception, who&s;oever came before them. It happened the &s;ame time, that the Prie&s;t of that place, called Mr. <HI>Paul Era&s;mu&s;on,</HI> fled upon a Rock with a little child; the Turks pur&s;ued him, and took fir&s;t the Child, which he had laid down, and after|wards pur&s;ued the Prie&s;t, wherefore he leaped down from a very high pro|montory, under which many people had hidden them&s;elves from the ene|my, and God made it come to pa&s;s &s;o wonderfully that he &s;topped upon a Turffe of Earth that was &s;oft and well overgrown with Gra&s;s, there be|ing round about nothing but Clifts and Stones; yet, though his body was not endamaged, his mind was never|thele&s;s very much di&s;tracted by that high fall.

<P>A part of the Pyrates crew run pre|&s;ently over the Land, and took one of the Inhabitants Boats, wherewith they fled from <HI>Feroe</HI> to <HI>Hetland;</HI> tho&s;e that were left&punc;behind were taken and han|ged.

<P>It is not heard or read, of any civil war, or inward tumult in <HI>Feroe,</HI> as in <HI>I&s;land,</HI> though there be an old tale of &s;ome troubles in the Country, and there hath been &s;hewed me a valley in <HI>Cal&s;oe,</HI> above the village of <HI>Migle|dal,</HI> where two armies of the Inhabi|tants have fought together, and two hills under which they &s;ay, the dead are buried; though they know not the true ground thereof.

It may be, that he, as an heir to the Crown of <HI>Nor|way,</HI> would reduce <HI>Feroe</HI> to obedience, but that he was di&s;com&s;ited and forc'd to go out of the Country to &s;eek the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Si&s;ter <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> and that his de&s;ign vani&s;hed by his death.

from civil, as from foreign wars, ex|cept what oppre&s;&s;ion the Sea-robbers and tho&s;e of their party did them; they have during their long tranquili|ty taken great care to cultivate the ground, having not only till'd, Plan|ted, aud built the places that are now inhabited, but other places be&s;ides, that are now left untill'd, and are &s;el|dome renewed.</P>
<P>They devide the ground which they till, into acres; the acre being &s;ubdivided into ells, &s;o that by an a|cre of ground is under&s;tood 320 <HI>Ham|borough</HI> Ells four &s;quare; whereunto belongeth al&s;o a part of the ground that is without the Inclo&s;ure; yet there is a great difference in the great|ne&s;s of the divi&s;ions, though every a|cre of Land be reckoned for 320 ells. And the Acres con&s;i&s;ting in that &s;ort of mea&s;ure, the poor free-holders know to divide it after their decea&s;|ed Parents in many &s;mall parts, name|ly, in 80, 60, 40, 20, and 10 ells, and an acre of ground co&s;ting, according to the ancient price of Land, &s;ixteen

This divi&s;ion being very da|mageable to the Country, for it ma|keth many poor people; they do not plow their ground, but dig it, ma|king deep furrows laing the earth, which they dig out of them, on the ground clo&s;e together, the dung be|ing laid under it before. Neither is each Field above 3 ells broad, u&s;ual|ly with a ridge on the one &s;ide, that water may always have its fall into the furrow, and continually flow a|way, there falling here very much rain; afterwards they break the Earth that was laid over, with a &s;pade in&s;tead of harrowing it; and when they have &s;owed their Seed, they clap the earth over with flat pieces of Wood; in&s;tead of rowling it over. So that they have a great deal of la|bour
<PB N="256" REF="152">
and pain in the Tillage of their ground, which cannot otherwi&s;e be, becau&s;e of the Lands propriety. The ground which they thus Till, they let re&s;t 8 or 10 years, for it will not bear fruit every year; but in the mean time it yields excellent Gra&s;s for Hay, which they only mow, and not that which groweth in Moori&s;h grounds, as they do in other Coun|treys.</P>
<P>As they have a great deal of la|bour in the Tillage of their ground, &s;o they have no le&s;s about their Corn; for they cut it off with an ordinary Knife, and puck every Ear from the Straw, drying them afterwards in a Kilne; the Corn not coming here to perfect Matu|rity. Afterwards, in&s;tead of Thra|&s;hing, Women tread the Ears of Corn with their bare feet; all this labour about their Corn ta|king up a great deal of time al|mo&s;t unprofitably; which might well be remedied, but they are &s;o

<P>The third &s;ort is called <HI>Elephantia|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> from the Elephant, to whom they become like on their skin, the body and face of him that is infected with this Di&s;ea&s;e is full of knobs.

I find the cau&s;e of this Lepro&s;ie to be the air and dyet; for as we &s;aid above, here
<PB N="312" REF="181">
is u&s;ually a pretty cold and moi&s;t air, which u&s;ually cau&s;eth the Scurvy to tho&s;e that lead a &s;olitary life, and this hath a great affinity with Lepro|fy. Be&s;ides the meat of all, &s;peci|ally of the poorer &s;ort, is half rotten fle&s;h or fi&s;h all their nouri&s;hment in Summer being likewi&s;e fre&s;h fi&s;h and &s;weet Milk, without any Salt; wher|fore he that is not of a &s;trong and good complexion, may ea&s;ily have his blood corrupted, the &s;ickne&s;s gnawing then it &s;elf throught he body, before it breaketh out, and when a|ny one is &s;o infected he may ea&s;ily give it to another, that is of the &s;ame complexion with the &s;ick. Now that Di&s;ea&s;e acting a great while in a man, before it breaketh out, it hap+peneth that many that think they be clean on both &s;ides, do marry toge|ther; and yet afterwards the one is found to be infected. God and na|ture deals wonderfully with &s;uch people in their marriage, for among&s;t the children they beget, &s;ome clean and &s;ome unclean. I have 3 exam|ples
<PB N="313" REF="181">
in my Pari&s;h of Women that have been unclean, and have brought forth many Children, whereof mo&s;t are married, none of them being yet found to be unclean; wherefore the Inhabitants take but little care in their woing, whether their Parents have been clean or no. I have al&s;o an ex|ample, that the Father hath been un|clean, and yet the Children health|ful. It has al&s;o been taken notice of, that two living together in Marriage, though the one be found infected, they live together as before, as long as one doth but murmur of it, till the Magi&s;trate doth &s;eparate them, and yet the &s;ound remaineth uninfected, whereas another is often taken with the Di&s;ea&s;e by a very little conver|&s;ation. Here are examples yet be|fore our eyes, that poor Cripples, clean but helple&s;s, have been put a|mong the &s;ick in the Ho&s;pital, eat with them, conver&s;e dayly with them, and are not infected in the whole time of their lives; what is this? but that God confirms the truth of his word,

taking plea&s;ure in them that live in a ju&s;t Wedlock, and wander in Law|ful ways, putting their hopes in him, that neither fire nor Water, contagi|ous di&s;ea&s;e, nor dangerous Pe&s;tilence &s;hall hurt them.</P>

<P>Though the Inhabitants of <HI>Feroe</HI> did not, after the Death of <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> break the contract of their Bapti&s;me with Chri&s;t, as is perceived and con|cluded by the Hi&s;tory of King <HI>Olaus</HI> the Holy, who not only acquired friends in <HI>Feroe,</HI> but al&s;o called them to him, and made them take their oath which he had not done, if they had not confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, having continual work with tho&s;e of <HI>I&s;land</HI> that came to him to be converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, as the Chronicle of <HI>Norway</HI> plainly teacheth. Neverthele&s;s one may well perceive that the beginnings of Reli|gion were very mean, the Inhabitants in a long time refu&s;ing to acknowledge the Kings of <HI>Norway</HI> for their Sove|raigns. Whence we find al&s;o, that it was long before they got any Bi&s;hops

in the Country: for Bi&s;hop <HI>Sarquir,</HI> that is the fifth in the Catalogue of Bi&s;hops, which Mr. <HI>Peter Clau&s;on</HI> reckoneth, lived 200 years after <HI>Si|gi&s;mund Bre&s;te&s;on;</HI> for he was Bi&s;hop in the time of King <HI>Hagen Hagen&s;on,</HI> in the year 1223. as is &s;aid before in the 4th. chapter. Wherefore, if the Preaching of the Go&s;pel had conti|nued without interruption, there would needs have been more then four Bi&s;hops in two ages, though there may be an errour in the Cata|logue, &s;ince we find that there has been a Bi&s;hop in <HI>Feroe,</HI> in the time of King <HI>Magnus Erling&s;on,</HI> in the year 1277. who&s;e name was <HI>Roar,</HI> by whom King <HI>Suere</HI> was brought up, who&s;e name, though the mo&s;t re|nowned among&s;t them is left out of the Bi&s;hops Catalogue; it might therefore more probably be, that &s;ome of their names are left out, of whom we find nothing in Hi&s;tory; yet how&s;oever it be, all beginnings being difficult, &s;pecially the light of the word being ob&s;tructed by the

Prince of darkne&s;s, it may very well have been &s;o in matters of Religion, here in <HI>Feroe,</HI> till at la&s;t there came Bi&s;hops into the Country, but we cannot find when that was; po&s;&s;ible in King <HI>Sigurd</HI> the <HI>Hiero&s;olumites</HI> time, in the age 1100. when the Kings of <HI>Norway</HI> were well &s;etled, wherewith the Catalogue of Bi&s;hops doth be&s;t agree.</P>
<P>When the &s;aid Bi&s;hops came fir&s;t higher, they had their re&s;idence at <HI>Kircke boe</HI> in <HI>Stremoe,</HI> where there hath been formerly many &s;tone build|ings that are now ruin'd, there only remaining a &s;tone hou&s;e with a great Parlour of Timber, built after the an|tient fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The Church which they had then in that place, is yet &s;tanding, and is made u&s;e of: it is built of free-&s;tone, but of a very poor and low &s;tructure. There &s;tands be&s;ides, another new Church-wall, which one of the la&s;t Bi&s;hops called <HI>Hillarius</HI> did build, it is a curious Edifice of even &s;tone, and the frames of the Windows are

of Stone, purpo&s;ely cut for that u&s;e. The Wall is yet in &s;ome manner unhurt, and one might yet build a Church of it, if the hearers would not &s;pare their pains.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops in tho&s;e days here as in other places, have had great reve|nues of the Country, but the Prie&s;ts have fared very meanly; It is not cer|tainly known how many Bi&s;hops have been in <HI>Feroe:</HI> Mr. <HI>Peter Clau&s;on</HI> in his De&s;cription of <HI>Norway,</HI> reckoneth up the following, <HI>Sudmunds, Mathias, Kroll, Suein</HI> or <HI>Swerke, Peter, Gauti, Serquir, Erland</HI> or <HI>Ellendar, Loden, Sigvar, Giaffvard, Hanard;</HI> be&s;ides the&s;e, there is found Bi&s;hop <HI>Roar</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of King <HI>Suerre,</HI> who it &s;eems &s;hould be the third in order, and be&s;ides the &s;aid Bi&s;hop <HI>Hillarius,</HI> that built the new Church wall. <HI>Arrild Huitfield</HI> in the Chronicle of King <HI>Frederick</HI> the I. in the year 1532. writes, that <HI>Amund Oluff&s;on</HI> was cho|&s;en Bi&s;hop of <HI>Feroe,</HI> being a Canon of <HI>Bergen,</HI> and gave the King 1000 Gilders of <HI>Feroe,</HI> for his confirmation;

<P>Thus there is in <HI>Feroe</HI> 39 Pari&s;h-Churches; the &s;aid Churches are but little according to the meanne&s;s of the Congregations; they are built with deals, and without covered with &s;tones: except the Church of <HI>Thors haven,</HI> which is pretty great, being built of whole beams, with a &s;teeple thereby, whereunto King <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the Fourth of happy Memory, gave Timber, and cau&s;ed it to be built in the year 1609. And the Congregati|ons lying &s;o wide &s;cattered from each other, the Prie&s;ts have a great deal of pains, and undergo great dangers in Winter in vi&s;iting them often; be|&s;ides, &s;ome lie a great way from their hou&s;es, and the Churches that are far remote on the little I&s;lands cannot al|ways be attended, becau&s;e of &s;torm and bad weather. And when one comes there, the Service of God mu&s;t be regulated according to the Tides;
<PB N="327" REF="188">
which if neglected one mu&s;t tarry there &s;ix hours longer, and in the mean time the wind may change; &s;o that &s;torm and bad weather keepeth one there a whole fortnight. When the Prie&s;t will vi&s;it great <HI>Dimen,</HI> they mu&s;t draw him up, and let him down with a rope: neither can he come to them but in the Summer. They do not vi&s;it their Congregations every Sunday, but every 5th, 6th, or 7th week, as the &s;ea&s;on of the year will permit.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts Revenue is this, They have of every one of their hearers, that receiveth the Sacrament, one skin, that is four <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> &s;hillings, in|&s;tead for their offering, the three great Fea&s;ts of the year; which may a|meunt to the &s;um of thirty Gilders; in &s;ome placestwenty Gilders, or le&s;s. 2ly they have for Tythes, the 4th part of Corn, wool, butter and fi&s;h. In the Southern Inlets where the Land is mo&s;t fruitful, their Tythes may amount in Corn to eight or ten tuns. In the North Inlets to four or &s;ix Tuns. In the Northern Inlets, they have in
<PB N="328" REF="189">
the greate&s;t Corporations 10 or fif|teen Loads of wa&s;hed wool, in the le&s;&s;er Corporations, 4, 6, or 8 Loads, according as God maketh &s;heep pro&s;|per; and thus &s;ome years more, and &s;ome years le&s;s. In the Northern In|lets, namely in <HI>Sandoe</HI> and <HI>Suderoe,</HI> where &s;heeps wool is &s;hort, and of &s;e|veral colours, they get little or no Tythes thereof. They have a Tun, or &s;omething more of butter, in the be&s;t Pari&s;hes, and 10 or 30 Loads of fi&s;h; &s;ome years very little, according as God ble&s;&s;eth their fi&s;hing, though it be there now very little e&s;teemed. The Prie&s;ts have ever from the beginning had a hou&s;e, which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to givet hem; whereof if the rent were to be paid, it would amount according to the Book of Rents, to a matter of 20 Gilders.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hing having now failed this ma|ny years, &s;o that the Prie&s;ts could hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and there being no means to a&s;&s;i&s;t Prie&s;ts Widows, that did not marry the Succe&s;&s;our; his Maje&s;ty King <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the Fourth

(wherefore the Lord reward him c|ternally) upon their humble Petiti|on, gratiou&s;ly granted every Prie&s;t of this Country yet another free hou&s;e, namely in the year 1632, the 23<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April;</HI> the Revenue whereof may amount to 20 Gilders: by which Grant the condition of Prie&s;ts is pret|ty well bettered. According to the premi&s;&s;es the Revenue of a Prie&s;t put together, in the be&s;t Corporation may amount to a great 100 of Gilders; where with noue can maintain him&s;elf and his wife and Children; but, as in <HI>Denmark</HI> the Prie&s;ts have pretty good Revenue of their own tillage, in their free hou&s;es; likewi&s;e here home bred &s;heep and kine do conti|nually feed the Family, but wool mu&s;t contribute mo&s;t to houskeep|ing, the be&s;t and cleare&s;t money pro|ceeding from thence. Wherefore a Prie&s;t in <HI>Feroe,</HI> when his duty doth not take him up, mu&s;t not only be a good Husbandman, but al&s;o a good Tradesman, that is, a Ho&s;e-knitter; for he, and his wife, mu&s;t diligently
<PB N="330" REF="190">
look to it that his people do &s;pin and knit &s;tockings, that may be merchants ware; which if they do not, they fall to ruine.

That if an Angel of Heaven would preach another Go&s;pel, than Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles have prea|ched, let him be an Anathem. Upon the Premi&s;es I cannot judge, but that this apparition hath been a Phanta&s;m, or illu&s;ion, and all the admonition, that &s;imple young man had had a Phanta&s;ie. There is enough written of Phanta&s;ms in &s;everal Treati&s;es, and they are of many &s;orts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Phanta&s;ms or Illu&s;ions, that hap|pen in the Air, and are called by Natu|rali&s;ts

<P N="2">2. Phanta&s;ms, that &s;eems to be, and are not; as when the Apo&s;tles believed Chri&s;t to be an apparition or &s;pirit, when he, in a &s;trange manner, did walk upon the Sea, and after his Re&s;urrection came in to them, the doors being &s;hut.</P>
<P N="3">3. Phanta&s;ms, that by natural cau&s;es, namely the temperature and &s;ickne&s;s of a man, or what they think much upon, do appear in dreams. In this manner the Emperor <HI>Nero</HI> did no &s;ooner fall a|&s;leep, but he had &s;trange dreams, ha|ving killed his own Mother; his Tutor, and many other Citizens innocently. Thus cholerick and melancholy folks are troubled with Vi&s;ions, according to the predominant humour; whereof Phy&s;i|tians and Naturali&s;ts write at large. St. <HI>Au&s;tin de Civit Dei, l.</HI> 18. writes, that one had related him, that before he went to bed, in his hou&s;e, he &s;aw a certain Phi|lo&s;opher come to him, expounding him the Books of <HI>Plato,</HI> which he had de&s;i|red

In this Example the one &s;aw in a dream, what the other &s;aw waking.</P>
<P N="4">4. Phanta&s;ms in them&s;elves, as they are and appear to men, when they are awake, that have properly no bodies, but a&s;&s;ume one for a time, to delude man|kind, &s;uch commonly announce men pu|ni&s;hment and univer&s;al calamities, or bring them a de&s;pairing horror for their &s;ins. It was &s;uch a one that appeared to <HI>Saul</HI> in the likene&s;s of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and an|nounced him his death. <HI>Plutarch</HI> re|lates, that there appeared a &s;pirit to <HI>Marcus Brutus,</HI> as he was awake; and <HI>Brutus</HI> asking him who he was? he told him he was an evil &s;pirit, and that he &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee him in the <HI>Philippian</HI> Fields.

and yet having lo&s;t his &s;ight won a great Battle upon the Enemy; &s;uch &s;pirits do vex men, and either hereby &s;trengthen them in their old errors, or will bring them into new ones, as the adoration of &s;trange gods, and &s;uper&s;titious works, which happened but too much in the times&punc; of Popery. All Learned Divines tell us, what we mu&s;t believe of &s;uch apparitions, namely, that they are evil &s;pirits.</P>
<P>In the relation of this &s;imple man, there is made mention of two &s;orts of apparitions; the one &s;een in the air, namely an u u&s;ual Sun, that was nothing but an illu&s;ion of Satan, whereby he en|deavoured to introduce a &s;trange adora|t on of God, and &s;uper&s;titious acts, which God does not require from us, that &s;o he might by the&s;e Vi&s;ions, &s;e|duce them from the true word of God, to believe deceitful errors. Satan that brought down fire from Heaven upon the Cattle of <HI>Job, Job</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 16. could ea&s;ily cau&s;e to &s;hine a bright fire in the sky, evil &s;pirits, reigning in the air, <HI>E|phe&s;.</HI> 6. <HI>ver.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>The other was properly a Phanta&s;m,
<PB N="400" REF="225">
or &s;pirit: I am in doubt whether one may refer apparitions in dreams to Spe|cters, it being fir&s;t come to him in his &s;leep, when he was &s;ick, which might indeed cau&s;e &s;uch a fancie; but &s;ince it hath oftner appeared to him afterwards, when he was in perfect health and a|wake, and I often diligently asked the party, whether this was really &s;een by him; which he ever con&s;tantly affirm'd&punc; we mu&s;t conclude, that it was a &s;pirit and apparition; and though it had not &s;uch terrible a&s;pect as the former Exam|ples, yet we know that Satan can trans|form him&s;elf into an Angel of light, that evil &s;pirit knowing very well that he could have promoted his Kingdom but little if he had appeared in his terrible figure, and put the black-&s;ide outward; wherefore he cloathed him&s;elf in a white &s;hining Garment, and a Prie&s;ts Habit, which is not his fir&s;t Ma&s;ter&punc;piece; for <HI>Sulpitius Severus</HI> in the life of <HI>Martin</HI> the Bi&s;hop writeth, that Satan appeared once unto him when he was in bed and prayed, having a golden Crown on his head, and a white &s;hining Garment on, with gilt &s;hooes,
<PB N="401" REF="225">
who &s;poke to him, &s;aying, I am Je&s;us, who being come down on the earth, would fir&s;t appear unto thee. <HI>Martin</HI> having look'd upon him, and bethought him&s;elf, &s;aid, Je&s;us did not go in this manner on earth, depart from me Sa|tan. Whereupon he pre&s;ently vani&s;h|ed, with a great &s;tink. <HI>Plinius Secundus Novocamen&s;is, Hi&s;t.</HI> 7. <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> relates, that there lay a Boy and &s;lept among&s;t other Children in the Chamber, when two &s;pirits in white Clothes were &s;een to come therein, that cut the Boys hair as he lay a&s;leep, going &s;o away; and in the morning the Boy was found with his hair cut, and &s;pread about in the bed. There are Examples enough of Gho&s;ts that have appeared in Prie&s;ts clothes, du|ring the time of Popery, which we will omit, becau&s;e of their prolixity. Thus the white cloathes and holy Garments of this evil &s;pirit cannot avail him, for he di&s;covers him&s;elf, not only by his erro+neous Service of God, but al&s;o by pre|tending to be the Per&s;on of St. <HI>John</HI> that lay in Chri&s;ts bo&s;ome at the Lords Sup|per. For having not been con&s;tant in truth, neither can he always &s;peak
<PB N="402" REF="226">
truth. And we know that God &s;ends his Angels, for their &s;ake that are to in|herit Salvation, and not the Souls of the dead; for they are in the hand of God, where they re&s;t from all their labours. And if any of them appeared unto us, they &s;hould either do it of their own Authority, which they cannot in the condition they are now, or by the com|mand of God, which happeneth not; for men have <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets, unto whom they &s;hould hearken during this life, <HI>Luke</HI> 16. <HI>ver.</HI> 26. and it were in vain for them to appear, &s;ince none mu&s;t believe them, under great puni&s;hment of God, <HI>Deut.</HI> 18&punc; <HI>ver.</HI> 11. yea, the Soul of dead Saints have left all thoughts and care of earthly things; for <HI>Abraham</HI> knoweth nothing of us, and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> remembreth us not, <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 64. <HI>v.</HI> 16. Finally, we read no where, either in the Old or New Te&s;tament, that God hath any time conver&s;t with the living by means of the dead; God &s;poke indeed many times, and in &s;everal manners, to the antient by his Prophets, but now he hath &s;poken to us by his Son, and his Son withdrawing from us his

We may per|ceive by the premi&s;es, that the &s;pirit of lies was not the per&s;on whom he preten|ded to be, being much le&s;s &s;ent of God, as he gave out, but was the unclean &s;pi|rit him&s;elf. This &s;alutation al&s;o gives no little &s;u&s;pition of him, when he u&s;ed an earne&s;t &s;alutation and wor&s;hip! which agreeth little with that of holy Angels, but is rather like that of <HI>Apollo,</HI> the Idol of <HI>Delphos,</HI> which always contained &s;ome hidden My&s;tery. Neither ought it to be an occa&s;ion of error to any, that he healed him: It may be the young man was cured of him&s;elf on the four|teenth day, but if it be &s;o, as the par|ty &s;olemly prote&s;teth; it is ea&s;ie for the Divel to heal and do good for a bad end, that he might thereby confirm men in their errors.

The Apo&s;tles &s;hewing great &s;ignes and miracles, by healing the &s;ick, and making the blind to &s;ee, that they might bring blind Heathens from darkne&s;s to light, and from Belial to Chri&s;t; <HI>Simon</HI> the Magician is pre&s;ently ready to doe the &s;ame by the help of Satan, as powerfully and ma|&s;terly to the eyes of all <HI>Samaria,</HI> &s;o that many &s;tuck to him and &s;aid, this is the great power and vertue of God, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 9, 10.
