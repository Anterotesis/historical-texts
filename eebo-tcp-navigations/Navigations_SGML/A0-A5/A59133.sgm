<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the Town of BOSTON.</HEAD>
<P>IN the bottom of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Bay, is <HI>Boston,</HI> and is the Metropolis of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> Colony, or rather of the whole Country, &s;ituated upon a Penin&s;ula, about four miles in Compa&s;s; almo&s;t &s;quare, and invironed with the Sea, &s;aving one &s;mall I&s;thmus, which gives ac|ce&s;s by Land to other Towns: On the South-&s;ide, the Town hath two Hills of equal height, on the Frontier part thereof next the Sea; the one well Fortified on the Superficies with &s;ome Artilery mounted commanding any Ship as &s;he Sails into the Harbour, within the &s;till Bay: The other Hill hath a &s;trong Battery built with whole Tim|ber, and fill'd with Earth. At the de&s;cent of the Hill, in the extream|e&s;t part thereof, betweeen the&s;e two &s;trong Arms, lies a large Cove or Bay, on which the chiefe&s;t part of the Town is built; to the North|we&s;t is a high Mountain, that out-tops all with its three ri&s;ing Hills on the Summit, called <HI>Tramount;</HI> this is furni&s;hed with a Beacon, and great Guns, (as may be &s;een in the Pro&s;pect of the Town, hereunto Annexed:) from hence you may over-look all the I&s;lands in the Bay, and de&s;cry &s;uch Ships as are upon the Coa&s;t. The Hou&s;es are, for the mo&s;t part, rai&s;ed upon the Sea-Banks, and are Wharfed out with great Indu&s;try and Co&s;t, many of them &s;tanding upon Piles, clo&s;e together on each &s;ide, as in <HI>London,</HI> and furni&s;hed with many fair Shops; their Materials are Brick, Stone, Lime, hand&s;omly con|trived, with three Meeting-Hou&s;es, and a Town-Hou&s;e built upon Pillars, where the Merchants may Confer; in the Chambers above, they keep their Monthly Courts.

The Town is Rich and very Populous, much fre|quented by Strangers; here is the Dwelling-Hou&s;e of their Governour.</P>
<P>On the Northwe&s;t and Northea&s;t, two con&s;tant Fairs are kept for daily Traffique thereunto: On the South there is a &s;mall but plea&s;ant Common, where the Gallants a little before Sun-&s;et walk with their
<PB REF="4">Marmalet Madams, (as they do here in <HI>Moor-fields</HI>) till the Nine-a-Clock Bell rings them Home to their re&s;pective Habitations; when pre&s;ently the Con&s;tables walk their Rounds to &s;ee good Orders kept, and to take up loo&s;e People.</P>
<P>Two miles from the Town, at a place called <HI>Muddy</HI> River, the Inhabitants have Farms, to which belongs rich Arrable Grounds and Meadows, where they keep their Cattle in the Summer, and bring them to <HI>Boston</HI> in the VVinter. The Harbour before the Town is filled with Ships and other Ve&s;&s;els, for mo&s;t part of the Year.</P>

<P>On the North-&s;ide of <HI>Boston,</HI> flows <HI>Charles</HI>-River, which is about &s;ix fathom deep; many &s;mall I&s;lands lie to the Bay-ward, and Hills on either &s;ide of the River, a very good Harbour; here may forty Sail of Ships ride. The Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Boston</HI> to <HI>Charles</HI>-town, is by a Ferry, worth forty or fifty Pound a year, and is a quarter of a mile over: the River <HI>Mistick</HI> runs through the North-&s;ide of the town, and by its near approach to <HI>Charles</HI> River, in one place makes a very narrow Neck, where &s;tands mo&s;t part of the town. The Market|place not far from the Water-&s;ide, is &s;urrounded with Hou&s;es, forth of which i&s;&s;ue two Streets, orderly built and beautified with Orchards and Gardens; their Meeting-Hou&s;e &s;tands on the North-&s;ide of the Market, having a little hill behind it; there belongs to this town 1200 Acres of good Arrable Land, 400 Head of Cattel, and as many Sheep: the&s;e al&s;o provide them&s;elves Farms in the Country.</P>
<P>Higher up in <HI>Charles</HI> River We&s;tward, is a broad Bay, two miles over, into which runs <HI>Stony</HI> River, and <HI>Muddy</HI> River.</P>

They have &s;tore of Cattel and Sheep, and near upon 2000 Acres of Arrable Land. Ships of &s;mall burden may come up to the&s;e Towns.</P>
<P>We will now return to <HI>Charles</HI> Town again, where the River <HI>Mi|stick</HI> runs on the North-&s;ide of the Town, where on the N. We&s;t-&s;ide of the River is the Town of <HI>Mistick,</HI> three miles from <HI>Charles</HI> Town by Land, a League and a half by Water, a &s;cattered Village.

At the end of a &s;andy Beach, is a Neck of Land called <HI>Nahant,</HI> it is &s;ix miles in Circumference. <HI>Black William,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> Duke, out of his Genero&s;ity, gave this to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> At the Mouth of the River runs a great Creek into a great Mar&s;h, called <HI>Rumney Mar&s;h,</HI> which is four miles long, and a mile broad: This Town hath the benefit of Minerals of divers kinds, Iron, Lead, one Iron-Mill, &s;tore of Cattel, Arrable Land and Meadow.</P>
