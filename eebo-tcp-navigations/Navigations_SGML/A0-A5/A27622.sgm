<P>I have taken Notice by General Di&s;cour&s;e; Your Lord|&s;hip in your Publick Attendance on the Wor&s;hip of God, appears to De&s;ire the Reconciliation of <HI>Protestants,</HI> whe|ther under tho&s;e unde&s;irable, and, as too much mannaged, unkind di&s;tinctions of <HI>Epi&s;copacy, Presbytery,</HI> or <HI>Congregati|onal</HI> Union.</P>

<P>There is one thing more, I Congratulate to your Lord|&s;hip this Year of your &s;o eminent <HI>Magi&s;tracy</HI> in; And that is, An appearance of Zeal for the Retrenchment and Ex|tirpation of open Prophane&s;s, Irreligion, and Lewdne&s;s of Manners: I cannot but have an Honour for any &s;uch un|dertaking, and be&s;eech of God his pre&s;ence with it, and Ble&s;&s;ing upon it; So far as it bears, but a de&s;ire to prepare for, (if I may &s;o allude) a <HI>Temple</HI> for God in the <HI>Nation;</HI> and I doubt not.

<P>SEeing this Review re&s;ts upon the very Eminent Appearances of God in this pre&s;ent Year 1697, I think it no way Improper to prefix a &s;erious per|&s;wa&s;ive, deeply to con&s;ider the <HI>Operations</HI> of the <HI>Divine Hand,</HI> and to <HI>&s;earch them out, as Hidden Trea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> and Irreverence of the Divine Being, and his Government of the World, that we Lavi&s;h out his Great Providences into no other Di&s;|cour&s;es, but as of News; This is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;erious Chri&s;tian, and of tho&s;e who have the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Sacred Hi&s;tory,</HI> directing us what ob&s;ervations to make upon tho&s;e works; and the <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy</HI> Guiding us, what we are to expect, by due Reflexion, on what God hath done according to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> to what he will do to the End of the World: It is not enough for us with a &s;hew of Great Wi&s;dom and Fore&s;ight, to Dilate upon the Political Tendencies of Great Events, lea&s;t we Fall into the <HI>Hipocri&s;y</HI> of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who were able to make Natural ob&s;ervations on the Face of the Heavens, but could not <HI>Di&s;cern the &s;igns of the Times:</HI> We ought as to make Improvement of Mercies, and Judg|ments, <HI>to &s;earch and try our ways, and to turn unto the Lord; to Prai&s;e Him for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men; So to &V;nder&s;tand as the Sons of I&s;&s;achar</HI> the <HI>Times,</HI> that we may know what <HI>I&s;rael ought to do;</HI> how to order our Supplicati|ons, and Declarations of the Hand of God; For all his Servants are yet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">itne&s;&s;es in Sackcloth, who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ower to &s;mite the Antichri&s;tian Earth with Plagues, as often, as they will;</HI> And it is their Duty at all Times to will <HI>to do it;</HI> to <HI>Prophecy</HI> to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> as God Commanded <HI>Ezekiel;</HI> That is, with Re&s;olution, and Con&s;tancy to declare the Judgments of God on the <HI>Antichri&s;tian Papacy;</HI> and to <HI>&s;hoot with the Arrow of the Lords Deliverance,</HI> not Twice or Thrice, but Seven Times to its utter Ruine; and to <HI>Give no Re&s;t to our God,</HI> Till He make <HI>Jeru&s;alem a Prai&s;e in the Earth.</HI> It is the Great Sin of Prote&s;tants, they do neither at this Time, with Becoming Zeal.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>I will therefore pre&s;ent, as under one view, the Great Works of God this Year, that are more Largely Di&s;cour&s;ed in the following Treati&s;e, and with &s;ome Remarks, that have not been made therein.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n the&s;e <HI>European Nations</HI> Signed the very Day of the Ancient <HI>Attonement,</HI> and <HI>Jubilee,</HI> and the <HI>Emperors</HI> Entry into it on the Day of <HI>Luthers</HI> Publication of his Go&s;pel&punc; Po&s;itions in the Fir&s;t opening of the <HI>Reformation</HI> 1517; Oh!

<HEAD><HI>A Review</HI> Of what God hath been plea&s;ed to do this Year accord|ing to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> and particulorly near the 23d of the Month we &s;tile, <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> with a mo&s;t humble <HI>A|pology</HI> and <HI>Defence</HI> concerning the falling &s;hort of Events, of what was expected according to the <HI>In|terpretation of that &s;ure Word of Prophecy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving made &s;o Long, and Large Declarations of what I have drawn from the <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy,</HI> concerning this <HI>Pre&s;ent Year</HI> 1697. And particularly near the 23d of the Month we Call, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ugu&s;t;</HI> And that nothing of &s;o Great an Appearance hath yet been vouch&s;afed by our Good and Gracious God; It may be looked upon as my Duty, to make either an Humble Acknowledgment of my mi&s;take, and the Deception, that the Ju&s;t and Holy Lord hath left me to therein, or to offer &s;ome <HI>Apology</HI> and <HI>Defence</HI> for my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Now in the fir&s;t Place, I would make the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ing Ac|knowledgment; That I am mo&s;t unworthy of any &s;uch Gracious Communica|tion, or Manife&s;tation from God in his Word; And mo&s;t worthy, whom He &s;hould give up to Error and Mi&s;take: And that therefore, It would be no won|der, nor any thing &s;trange, If. He in ju&s;t Wrath and Di&s;plea&s;ure have &s;o left me; All I have to &s;ay, or plead again&s;t its being &s;o, is Infinite Riches of Grace, Mercy and Compa&s;&s;ion in Chri&s;t to the <HI>Cheif of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>But this being fir&s;t Acknowledged, there is yet the Great Honour I owe to the Word of Truth, and to the weighty Rea&s;ons and Arguments I have de|rived from it; and the obligations that Lye upon me, to make the mo&s;t Low|ly and Thankful Declarations for any Communications of Light to me, and of what God hath been plea&s;ed to begin to do this Year, and &s;o hath not left wholly expo&s;ed, what I have &s;poken with Relation to 97. I would render there|fore the be&s;t Accounts I could, in Points of &s;o Great weight and concernment to the Churches of Chri&s;t, and even to the World in General, and to my &s;elf in Particular.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<P>The General Propo&s;al being then, to make a Review of this Year accordng to <HI>Prophecy;</HI> I would reduce the Di&s;cour&s;e upon it to the&s;e four Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. To ob&s;erve in a General way, and to Acknowledge Freely, what is mo&s;t undeniably wanting in any thing, that hath yet come to pa&s;s, of the Great Ex|pectations according to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> as yet in this 97.</P>
<P N="2">2. To pre&s;s notwith&s;tanding; That due Confe&s;&s;ion and Adoration be made of, and to Divine Providence in what hath Eminently been done this Year, and upon the very Time according to <HI>Prophecy;</HI> And to enquire diligently into its agreement with <HI>Prophecy.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To con&s;ider what is to be expected, as Imported to us in that of our Lords Oath; That the <HI>my&s;tery</HI> of God &s;hall be <HI>fini&s;hed</HI> in the Days of the <HI>Seventh An|gel, when</HI> Rev. 10. 7. <HI>He &s;hall Begin to &s;ound,</HI> by ob&s;erving the &s;everal Appli|cations of the Word <HI>My&s;tery</HI> to Things in the New Te&s;tament; And &s;hew|ing, that every one of tho&s;e things &s;hall have their Complement, and Fini&s;hing from the <HI>Seventh Angel Beginning to &s;ound,</HI> Till the very <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> and In it.</P>
<P N="4">4. To offer the be&s;t Conciliating Apprehen&s;ions, and Hopes with Relation to Time, according to Scripture, and <HI>Prophecy,</HI> between the Failure of Expe|ctation in 97; With what is to be Expected in 97 Ending, and 98 Beginning.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the fir&s;t Head, I mu&s;t Humbly and Freely Acknowledge, we do not yet behold the mighty effects of the <HI>Spirit of Life</HI> from God, upon the <HI>Witne&s;|&s;es</HI> in their &s;ufferings under <HI>Anti-chri&s;tian</HI> Powers; or the Univer&s;ality of the Witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t out of their <HI>Sackcloth-&s;tate,</HI> and <HI>Mournful Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t</HI> in delay, and not yet being in its Illu&s;trious Appearance: They have yet the <HI>Seale</HI> of Concealment on their <HI>Foreheads,</HI> and do not yet &s;tand on <HI>Mount Zion</HI> with the <HI>Lamb, having his Fathers Name</HI> Con&s;picuou&s;ly written on tho&s;e very <HI>Foreheads,</HI> where the <HI>Seal</HI> was before. That is, there is not yet that <HI>Pouring out of the Spirit;</HI> They are not yet publickly ju&s;tified, as the <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of Chri&s;t along the 1260 Years.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Stone cut out of the Mountains, that is not in Humane Hands;</HI> That is; That doth his Great Works immediately by him&s;elf, in breaking the <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Four Monarchyes</HI> in the la&s;t of them, and him&s;elf <HI>becoming a Great Mountain filling the whole Earth,</HI> hath not yet thus appear'd; mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. That therefore the <HI>Antichri&s;tian,</HI> and the <HI>Mahometan</HI> State joyn'd with it, tho as a woe upon it, are not &s;o broken yet, as that the <HI>Kingdoms of this World</HI> &s;hould by the <HI>Ten Kings</HI> being <HI>overcome</HI> by the <HI>Lamb,</HI> be Proclaimed to be <HI>become</HI> the <HI>Kingdoms of the Lord,</HI> and of his <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and He him&s;elf Univer&s;ally Ac|knowledged <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and his witne&s;&s;es with Him, Called, Cho&s;en, Faithful,</HI> and known to be &s;o. All which I had Hoped and Expected, &s;hould have come to pa&s;s in this Year 97: and in the <HI>Prophetical Hour, Viz.</HI> In the latter part of the Month <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> Herein therefore and thus far, I mo&s;t willingly and humbly Acknowledge my <HI>Fault</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;take:</HI> I come therefore to the Second Head, and that is to ob&s;erve, how far God hath been plea&s;ed to own his unworthye&s;t Servant this Year, and in the very time of the Year, in the Interpretation of <HI>Prophecy.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>And there are two Things, which I would Remark upon, as very Eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;po&s;es of Providence, wherein by <HI>Regarding the Operations of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>Searching</HI> out the more hidden Things in the Works of his Hand, as tho&s;e who <HI>Take Plea&s;ure therein;</HI> We may find a very wonderful agreement of Providence, with <HI>Prophecy</HI> in this very Year, and at that Noted time of the Year.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fir&s;t is, That &s;o Illu&s;trious Providential Revolution, of &s;etting Peace in &s;o many of the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> (into which the <HI>We&s;tern Roman Empire</HI> hath &s;tood &s;o long divided) after &s;o long a War.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;trokes by the &s;upreme ordination of Divine Government in the World, by the Hand of the <HI>Prince of Ma&s;covy,</HI> as a Prince of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Pro|fe&s;&s;ion</HI> (according to tho&s;e we Call) <HI>the Grecian Churches;</HI> and by the Hand of the <HI>Imperial Power,</HI> that &s;ubmits its &s;elf to the <HI>Roman Church</HI> (as it is al&s;o cal|led) and its <HI>Papacy</HI> upon the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>And on each of the&s;e I would make their Particular, and Peculiar Remarks, and Fir&s;t on the Fir&s;t.</P>

<P>Now thus far I have Remrak'd upon the Fir&s;t of the Providential Events of this Year, as it is preparatory to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, according to the <HI>Interpretation of Prophecy,</HI> That <HI>Prophecyings may not be de&s;pi&s;ed,</HI> but All awak|en'd Earne&s;tly to Pray, and wait for that <HI>Kingdom;</HI> &s;eeing there is &s;o much to be ob&s;erv'd in this Providential Revolution of the <HI>Peace,</HI> as to be a <HI>Door of hope,</HI> and a <HI>Day of &s;mall Things;</HI> and that in this very Year of 1697. And I dare not A&s;&s;ume it to be more, I humbly confe&s;s, as yet; As in the Following Ob&s;ervations upon the Great Strokes on the <HI>Turki&s;h Potentacy,</HI> I &s;hall further Acknowledge.</P>
<P>I come now to the Second Grand Providential Event of this Year 1697. The &s;evere Strokes, The Great Governour of the World, and <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> hath cau&s;ed by the Arms of the <HI>Czar of Mu&s;covy,</HI> and of the <HI>Emperor of Ger|many,</HI> to fall upon the <HI>Mahometan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ttoman Signiory;</HI> and to adju&s;t them by <HI>Pro|phecy</HI> to the near Approach of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>That I may pre&s;ent this in the Cleare&s;t and mo&s;t Compendious Table, I &s;hall Fir&s;t con&s;ider <HI>Mahometani&s;m in the General,</HI> as <HI>common</HI> to the <HI>Saracens and Turks;</HI> and then peculiarly, as it is now &s;eated in the <HI>Ottoman Turki&s;h Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> and each in &s;everal &s;hort Notes of Ob&s;ervation; and Argue from them the Great Hopes, that the&s;e Strokes upon that <HI>Mahometan Impo&s;ture and Tyranny,</HI> are Fore-Runners of the Final Di&s;&s;olution of it, and of the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P N="1">1. The very E&s;&s;ential State of this <HI>Impo&s;ture</HI> and <HI>Tyranny,</HI> is de&s;ign'd by God, as a <HI>Mock-Antichri&s;t</HI> to the Grand <HI>Roman Papal Antichri&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Para&s;elene,</HI> or Counterfeit <HI>Moon</HI> to his <HI>Moon,</HI> even as <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> is a <HI>mock-Chri&s;t,</HI> or in De&s;pite to our True <HI>Lord Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mahomet</HI> acknowledges Chri&s;t a Great <HI>Prophet,</HI> even as <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> does; but robs Him of the Glory of his Divinity, and of being the onely Su|preme, True <HI>Prophet,</HI> wherein He is an <HI>Antichri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He Abhors Idols; Herein He mocks <HI>Antichri&s;tian Idolatry,</HI> but &s;ets up the <HI>Idol-Prophet, Mahomet;</HI> Therein He is an <HI>Antichri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He pretends to an <HI>&V;niver&s;al Kingdom;</HI> Herein He mocks the <HI>Papal An|tichri&s;t;</HI> One by the Spiritual, the other by the Temporal Sword, pretends to an <HI>&V;niver&s;al Kingdom,</HI> but both undermine <HI>Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s Kingdom,</HI> and Both are <HI>Anti|chri&s;ts</HI> therein.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<P N="4">4. He offers a Fools <HI>Paradice,</HI> and Deliverance from Future Mi&s;ery, but as Counterfeit as the <HI>Popes</HI> Deliverance from Purgatory, by his <HI>Key of the Bottom|le&s;s Pit;</HI> Herein are they both <HI>Antichri&s;ts,</HI> but <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as coming la&s;t, and upon the <HI>Papacy,</HI> is a <HI>Mock-Antichri&s;t,</HI> an <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> in de&s;pite.</P>
<P N="5">5. He pretends &s;ome Reverence to &s;ome of the Sacred Writings, but hath brought in a Non&s;en&s;ic <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as vain as <HI>Papal Traditions,</HI> and <HI>Oral Laws.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Time therefore of the Beginning of this <HI>Impo&s;ture</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> was &s;oon after the <HI>Papal Supremacy,</HI> the one at 606. the other at 622. The one the <HI>Antichri&s;tian,</HI> the other the <HI>Mahometan Hegire,</HI> when its <HI>Tyranny</HI> came forth; while the one la&s;ts, the other la&s;ts al&s;o; when the one ends, the other &s;hall end al&s;o: If therefore <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI> Times determine in 97. <HI>Mahometan</HI> Times &s;hall determine with them; why them may we not hope, this Blow on <HI>Mahometani&s;m</HI> is an Alarm-Blow upon Both <HI>Antichri&s;ts</HI> now ready to Expire?</P>
<P>I come now more particularly to con&s;ider the <HI>Ottoman Turki&s;h Power,</HI> and to Remark on that, as more preci&s;ely before us in the Events of this Year; and &s;o make the&s;e Remarks upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power Appear'd in the Greate&s;t Extremity, and lowe&s;t Condition of the <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> after the Great Per&s;ecution upon Tho&s;e we call the <HI>Vaudois;</HI> and the mo&s;t cruel Slaughter of &s;o many of Them: In Re|venge of which, God &s;ent the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power, to Remon&s;trate again&s;t the <HI>An|tichri&s;tian Salvagene&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. The <HI>Ottoman Emperor, Selymus,</HI> in, or upon the Fir&s;t Year of the Refor|mation, 1517. &s;eized upon <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;tyled by <HI>Daniel,</HI> Ch. 11. 41. the <HI>Glorious Land.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 There is an Ab&s;olute Determination of God; This <HI>Mahometan Otto|man Prince &s;hall come to his End,</HI> C. 11. 45.</P>
<P>Seeing this is &s;o determined, we have Rea&s;on to look upon this very Year as the Year of his Approaching end, on the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Mahometan Ottoman Emperor,</HI> Coming in as a Judgment upon <HI>Papal, Antichri&s;tian Cruelty,</HI> and Advanced to the Throne of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Roman Em|pire,</HI> That he might be a <HI>Mock Antichri&s;t</HI> to the Grand <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t;</HI> He mu&s;t in all the Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> be Limited to the Times of the Fir&s;t <HI>Antichri&s;t;</HI> Becau&s;e, when the Sin is Removed, The Judgment &s;hall be Re|moved al&s;o; And when the True <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall <HI>Con&s;ume</HI> the Great <HI>Anti|chri&s;t</HI> by the <HI>Breath of his Mouth,</HI> He will Con&s;ume All other <HI>Antichri&s;ts</HI> with Him: If then the Times of the <HI>Papal Antichri&s;t,</HI> &s;hall End in this 1697. The <HI>Mahometan</HI> &s;hall End in it al&s;o.</P>
<PB REF="10">
<P N="2">2. Accordingly we find; The Time A&s;&s;igned to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power &s;tanding prepared to obtain, and to hold in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that <HI>Roman Ea&s;tern Empire,</HI> will exactly agree from the Time of His Ri&s;ing with the End of <HI>Antichri&s;tian Times;</HI> For let us with the be&s;t and mo&s;t of <HI>Chronologers,</HI> Date his Ri&s;ing to the Year 1300. And <HI>Prophecy</HI> A&s;&s;igns to him for the obtaining, and holding the <HI>Grecian Empire</HI> under his Power, an Hour, a Day, a Month, a Year; Which by Fair <HI>Prophetical</HI> Computation make up 397 Years, and &s;o mu&s;t end 1697.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;eizing on <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> ju&s;t at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> when the la&s;t 180 Years, or <HI>Half Time of Antichri&s;tiani&s;m</HI> entered, is a very Hopeful Argument to me, That this <HI>Ottoman</HI> Term of Power is this Year to End; For there is a Con|currence of Three Great Periods, according to that very &s;eizure of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power in the Year 1517. Which Fall on this very Year 1697.</P>
<P>The Period of the <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI> Times, in the la&s;t <HI>Half Time</HI> being Remar|ked as by the <HI>Reformation,</HI> &s;o by the Particular &s;troke of God on the <HI>Papal An|tichri&s;t,</HI> in the &s;eizure of &s;uch a Place, to which &s;o High a Devotion is preten|ded by the Grand <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> into the Hand of the <HI>Mock Antichri&s;t,</HI> and who Him&s;elf, to &s;hew Him&s;elf a <HI>Mock-Antichri&s;t,</HI> made the &s;ame pretence of Devo|tion to, and at it; As Hi&s;tory Reports of <HI>Selymus,</HI> that <HI>Turki&s;h Saltan&punc;</HI> who &s;eized it: And it is worthy ob&s;ervation, That the Enlargement of the <HI>Ottoman Empire</HI> at that Time, and in tho&s;e Parts, and Particularly on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">oly City</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> Gave the Fair and Plau&s;ible preten&s;ion to the <HI>Papal</HI> Rai&s;ing Money by <HI>Indulgences</HI> to with&s;tand and re&s;i&s;t it; Which odious Cheat of <HI>Indulgences</HI> gave the Great Advantage to the <HI>Reformation,</HI> as is well known; And it gives much Encouragement to Hope; So Eminent a Con&s;iguration again&s;t <HI>Antichri&s;tiani&s;m,</HI> as of the taking <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and the latter &s;o Derived from the <HI>Former,</HI> upon the Year 1517. Gives it an undoubted Title to be the Begin|ning of <HI>Half Time,</HI> or the La&s;t 180 Years of <HI>Antichri&s;tiani&s;m,</HI> and &s;o to be at an End this 1697.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Period of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Captivity,</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alems</HI> being <HI>Trodden under Foot of All Nations;</HI> For &s;eeing tho&s;e Times upon <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> are Bounded by the <HI>Gentiles Times Fulfilled,</HI> and that the Time of the <HI>Antichri&s;tian Apo&s;tacy,</HI> are peculiarly by <HI>Prophecy</HI> Branded, as <HI>Gentiles Times of Treading un|der Foot the Holy City:</HI> If the <HI>Antichri&s;tian Half Time</HI> (which is its la&s;t) Began 1517, and Ends 1697.

<P N="3">3. The Period of <HI>Mahometan</HI> Times Them&s;elves, mu&s;t be found in this very 1697.

<PB REF="11">
<P N="4">4. That Complication of Power, that &s;eems at this Time to be Gathering a|gain&s;t the <HI>Ottoman Empire,</HI> looks like a Hopeful Symptom, Their End is now Approaching: For &s;o <HI>Daniel</HI> de&s;cribing his End, &s;ays, <HI>Tydings out of the</HI> Ea&s;t <HI>and</HI> North <HI>&s;hall Trouble Him,</HI> and then the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 11. ult.</NOTE> Conclu&s;ion of All is, <HI>He &s;hall come to his End, and none &s;hall help Him.</HI> Now, how very exactly does this agree with the pre&s;ent Juncture, <HI>Viz.</HI> The Combination of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Forces on one &s;ide with the <HI>Imperial</HI> on the other &s;ide, in the &s;ame De&s;ign of bringing Him down: And what may come upon Him from <HI>Poland,</HI> He is not In&s;en&s;ible of; Now All the&s;e <HI>Trouble</HI> Him; And that unnatural Aid He had from <HI>France</HI> is de&s;erting Him; So that Things make up the very A&s;pect of that <HI>Prophetic Vi&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI> upon Him.</P>

<P N="6">6.

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1.

And in this Regard more Firm, that hereby the Computation of Years from the <HI>Re&s;urrection of our Lord,</HI> whith is the <HI>Apocalyptick Epoch</HI> is more A&s;|certained; It is more certainly known where to Begin and where to End: Hereby it is known, the 2300 <HI>Eves, Morns</HI> of Years, <HI>Dan.</HI> 8. Begin in the <HI>Vernal</HI> Beginning of each Year, and &s;o End, where the following Year Begins. That the 1260 Years of the <HI>Witne&s;&s;es Sackcloth-Prophecy,</HI> and of the <HI>Churches Wilder|ne&s;s</HI>-State mu&s;t Begin, and End &s;o; And that the <HI>Fourty two Moons</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> and of the <HI>Bea&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be Corre&s;pondently Governed; and &s;o the mi|&s;take of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 23 was only in a Circum&s;tance; as if the <HI>Lunar</HI> Years of the <HI>Bea&s;t,</HI> might have begun there and &s;o end there. But if the Beginning of all Account of <HI>Apolyptical Time,</HI> and &s;o of the End, be the Beginning of each Year in the Spring; Then mu&s;t the Event An&s;wering the 23d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the <HI>Roman We&s;tern</HI> Empire cea&s;ed, Fall into the Year, not of the la&s;t of the 1260, Becau&s;e the Time of the <HI>Months</HI> will not be run out, while the La&s;t is Current; but The fir&s;t Year of the New <HI>Era</HI> of Time, for <HI>Fini&s;hing the My|&s;tery,</HI> and when the Seventh <HI>Angel</HI> &s;hall begin to <HI>Sound,</HI> mu&s;t produce that Great Event in that Month, we Call <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and follow the <HI>Ri&s;ing of the Wit|ne&s;&s;es</HI> in the Beginning of that Year, An&s;werable to our Lords <HI>Re&s;urrection;</HI> and the <HI>Powring out of the Spirit,</HI> An&s;werable to the <HI>Apo&s;tolic Penteco&s;t;</HI> and &s;o the Fall of the <HI>Bea&s;tian-Power,</HI> and his Months quite darkened, An&s;werable to that 23d of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> when they began.</P>
<P>But if there had been the Change of the very Year it &s;elf, and &s;o the Lo&s;s of it.
