<P>Wee, being informed that the&s;e abu&s;es are &s;till continued to the indangering of that Plan|tation, and that the like abu&s;es are al&s;o practi&s;ed in other Forreigne Plantations: Out of Our Princely care for the pro&s;perity of the&s;e Colonies, which being well gouerned may be of great v&s;e to this Nation, for the reformation and preuention of the&s;e and the like enor|mities for the future.</P>
