<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT prompted me, after &s;o many Years Silence,
to expo&s;e this Piece to the World, was not &s;o
much the Old Topick, Importunity of &s;ome, as
the Impertinencies of others; there being more than Four hun|dred
Queries now by me, to which I was pre&s;&s;ed for An&s;wers, and
wherein I found a nece&s;&s;ity, if I declined this Work, to appear
from other Hands in Print. This then was the fir&s;t and chief
Cau&s;e; re&s;ting all that while content, that many Foreigners had
their Memoirs tran&s;lated, whereby I thought my &s;elf excu&s;ed
this Task; mo&s;t of whom, I had either &s;een or heard of be|yond
Sea, but never had read any of their Works, nor knew of
their Intentions to declare them&s;elves to the World: Finding
therefore on my Return, that they had been before-hand with
me, I did believe it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o many writing on the
&s;ame Subject, &s;hould not in many, and the mo&s;t material Points
e&s;pecially, if they followed Truth, relate the &s;ame things; which
made me &s;till de&s;i&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing it a lo&s;t Labour.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, con&s;idering tho&s;e Travellers before me had few
of them been in tho&s;e Parts where I had been, or at lea&s;t not
dwelt &s;o long there, I venture to offer &s;ome Novelties, either pa&s;|&s;ed
over by them, or el&s;e not &s;o thoroughly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>And indeed, this being the fir&s;t of this kind I know of, wrote by
our own Countrymen, &s;ince the Ingenious Sir <HI>Thomas Herbert,</HI>
I hope it may find the more favourable Acceptance; &s;ince it bears
no other De&s;ign than the Good of my Country, &s;etting before
them the True State of their Trade in <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The reclaiming of Athei&s;ts, by leading them fir&s;t to behold
the Beauty, Order, and admirable Di&s;po&s;ition of the Univer&s;e,
and then to &s;ee if they can &s;o far abu&s;e their Rea&s;on, to deny
the Author; which if they &s;hould, the <HI>Indians,</HI> how barbarous
&s;oever e&s;teemed by them, are to be preferred before them for
Men of Sen&s;e; who out of the very Principles of Nature,
keep to that Law written on their Minds, <HI>That there is a God
to be ador'd;</HI> and rather than be without, will frame to them|&s;elves
one of their own creating; which Depravity of theirs
while Athei&s;ts deride, they admoni&s;h them of as great an Error
in owning none.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, To inform tho&s;e bu&s;y Tran&s;lators, That the In|du&s;try
of our own Nation is not fallen beneath that of <HI>France,</HI>
who&s;e Language and Manners we &s;o &s;ervilely affect, as to think
nothing Excellent or <HI>Alamode,</HI> which has not a <HI>French</HI> Dre&s;s;
but that it &s;till is in the Power of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to retrieve their
former Renown both by Pen and Sword: <HI>Tam Marti quam
Mercurio.</HI> Nor will any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> accu&s;e me of Self-Confidence
or Arrogance, when it is a Ju&s;tice only intended my
Country again&s;t its Decriers; nor in the lea&s;t to undervalue the
Authors or the Books tran&s;lated, but to whet our Endeavours to
equalize, if not outdo them.</P>
<P>As to the Method I have taken, it is unconfin'd (it being
the Privilege of a Traveller) not bounded with the narrow
Terms of an Hi&s;torian, nor loo&s;ely extravagant, like Poetical
Fictions, but &s;uited both to Time and Place, and agreeable to
the Nature of the Relation: And herein I have followed <HI>Bu&s;|bequius;</HI>
which though it may make &s;ome Unevenne&s;s in the
Stile, as where the Ruggedne&s;s of the Ways interpo&s;e, or the
Subject-matter is varied, it mu&s;t happen, yet the Warp quite
through is mo&s;t of the &s;ame Thread; which being the Clue to &s;o
many and intricate Meanders, trodden by a few, I am the more
pardonable when I &s;lip: Though I do declare my de&s;ire is, To
&s;hew my Diligence in collecting, and Sincerity in compiling what
may make the Road more ea&s;y to the next Adventurers, and &s;a|tisfy
the pre&s;ent Enquirers.</P>

<P>IN the Afternoon I went a&s;hore, which was near two Miles from

<P>Before us in a Valley was a mo&s;t &s;tately Grove of Cocoes and<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;tately Grove.</NOTE>
Oranges (through which ran the Stream our Men filled their Casks
with Water) &s;urrounded with a Wall.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of which Trees, &s;o much celebrated for its u&s;efulne&s;s,
de&s;erves as much for the plea&s;ure it affords the Sight. It grows with
an upright, tall, and &s;lender Body, the Bark of an A&s;h colour, lori|cated;
not &s;ending any Branches forth till it come to its chiefe&s;t

to our <HI>O&s;mond</HI> Royal Fern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Cocoe Tree, its beauty and u&s;efulne&s;s.</NOTE> but more like the Palm; and under the&s;e
protects its weighty Fruit; which hang very thick round about the
Tree, to which it yields but one Stalk, but that fit to &s;upport its ponde|rou&s;ne&s;s;
every Moon produces a fre&s;h Harve&s;t both of Fruit and
Boughs; the fir&s;t being gathered, the others being thru&s;t off when
&s;aple&s;s by the young ones: If the Juicy ones be wounded, there di&s;tills
an heady Liquor, which they pre&s;erve in Earthen Pots fitted to re|ceive
it, but that &s;poils their bearing Nuts. Next to the Stalk it be|&s;tows
a Calix, not differing (only in bigne&s;s, and that it is &s;moother)
from that of our Acorn; from which proceeds the Rind of a lighter
Green, under which a fibrous &s;ub&s;tance pre&s;ents its &s;elf, which might
&s;upply them with Uten&s;ils, for Roaps and Sails; beneath which ap|pears
a &s;pacious brown Shell, proper for many Nece&s;&s;aries, big
enough for a Drinking Cup, a Ladle, and many more; &s;erving them
for the chief part of their Hou&s;hold&s;tuff: Enclo&s;ed in this is a deli|cious
Meat, white in Colour, cloathed with a pithy matter, as our
Ha&s;le-nuts, and not inferiour to them in Ta&s;te; this they chu&s;e for
their ordinary Nouri&s;hment. Nor does it afford them a le&s;s grateful
emul&s;ion, contained in the Nut to the quantity of a Pint, or Pint

<P>When the Meat of the Nut grows rancid, they expre&s;s an Oyl

<P>The Dolphin is extolled beyond the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dolphin.</NOTE> which they &s;trike with a

the Current of the Waters.</P>
<P>Gaining upon the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> with a &s;low pace, we met with tho&s;e fea|thered

<P>Three Months being near con&s;umed, we were at la&s;t accompa|nied
with long lookt for <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Bla&s;ts, and now we fly afore the
Wind: But by the way take notice a <HI>South-We&s;t</HI> Wind becomes as

<P>But bidding Adieu to the&s;e Fancies, the Wind that till now &s;eemed
to dally, proves in good earne&s;t, and begins a frowning <HI>April,</HI>
driving the trembling Sea on heaps, and on them piling more, till
the &s;welling Surges menace the lowering Skies, leaving a Hollow
where they borrowed their Gigantine va&s;tne&s;s, as if they were

de&s;cending down beneath no le&s;s uncomfortable, when the Vans of
the next Ships (though groveling with a neighbouring Wave)
could not be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>This to&s;&s;ing Condition la&s;ted long, and was taken kindly too,
as long as we &s;pooned before the Sea, and kept from running foul
of one the other; but when a Fret of Wind rowled the Waves
athwart our Quarters, it made our Ship &s;hake, proving the &s;ound|ne&s;s

have &s;unk without Bail or Mainprize. Still the Tempe&s;t encrea&s;es,

whereby we were &s;eparated from the re&s;t of our Fleet: For all, we
put our Lights abroad as did they, yet in the badne&s;s of the

<P>In this Encounter we &s;hipped many a perilous Sea, (not with|out

without difficulty re&s;trained from being carried over-board. In
this pickle we reeled out this Day, and out-&s;tretching the <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI>
we made what Sail we dur&s;t, and by the next Light had &s;ight of

were in &s;oundings eighty Fathom depth, which the Pilots note to
be in that di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Here we made two Sail to Leeward, and one to Windward,

pulling up into his Cott or Couch, would &s;milingly cro&s;s them, and
with his Nails claw off the Dirt. By him lay a Purple Silk Robe,

<P>The while we were there, they had a great Ve&s;&s;el on the Stocks;

<P>IT is a City that formerly for Riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></NOTE> Pride, and Luxury, was &s;e|cond

it has abated much of its adored Excellencies.</P>
<P>The Sea on one &s;ide greets its Marble Walls, on the other a Chain

which, called St. <HI>Thomas</HI> his Mount, is famous for his Sepulture, (in
Honour of whom a Chappel is dedicated, the Head Prie&s;t of which
was once the Metropolitan Bi&s;hop of <HI>India</HI>), and for a Tree called
<HI>Arbor Tri&s;tis,</HI> which withers in the Day, and blo&s;&s;oms in the Night.</P>
<P>About this Mount live a Ca&s;t of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Thomas</HI> Chri&s;tians.</NOTE> one of who&s;e Legs are as

<P>Within the Walls &s;even Churches an&s;wer to as many Gates; the
Rubbi&s;h of who&s;e &s;tupendious Heaps do ju&s;tify the truth of what is
predicated in relation to its pri&s;tine State.</P>
<P>The Builders of it were the <HI>Portugals.</HI></P>
<P>The Confounders the <HI>Moors,</HI> who &s;urprized them wallowing in
their Wealth and Wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Competitors are the <HI>French,</HI> who are very unlikely to
keep it (not for want of Valour, but for that few and unprovided,
are not able long to re&s;i&s;t multitudes) the <HI>Moors,</HI> and thirdly, the

the <HI>French</HI> fore&s;eeing, had wi&s;ely &s;olicited a Truce with <HI>Gulconda,</HI>
and had hopes of that King's complying, till the Arrival of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> when they could not be heard. For con&s;idering a Kindne&s;s

<P>Before which be accompli&s;hed, he may chance to find it an hard

they have War with <HI>France,</HI> would find them to be an Annoyance to
their Trade: So that were the City again in the hands of the <HI>Moors,</HI>

<P>Here it may be queried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King of <HI>Gul|conda</HI> weak at Sea.</NOTE> Why <HI>Gulconda</HI> being a Potent Prince,

<P>Where at fir&s;t landing they found a pretty well Seated, but ill For|tified

unle&s;s a few Chambers hou&s;ed in &s;mall Towers in convenient

depopulate whole Villages by their Outrages; either de&s;troying

than to make re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an invading Foe: For the <HI>Por|tugals</HI>
generally forgetting their pri&s;tine Vertue, Lu&s;t, Riot and Ra|pine,
the en&s;uing Con&s;equences of a long undi&s;turbed Peace where
Wealth abounds, are the only Remarkable Reliques of their Ancient
worth; their Courages being &s;o much effeminated, that it is a won|der
to mo&s;t how they keep any thing; if it were not that they have
lived among mean &s;pirited Neighbours. But to return to this Gar|den
of <HI>Eden,</HI> or Place of Terre&s;trial Happine&s;s, it would put the
Searchers upon as hard an Inque&s;t, as the other has done its Po&s;te|rity:
The Walks which before were covered with Nature's verdent
awning, and lightly pre&s;&s;ed by &s;oft Delights, are now open to the
Sun, and loaded with the hardy Cannon: The Bowers dedicated to
Re&s;t and Ea&s;e, are turned into bold Rampires for the watchful Cen|tinel
to look out on; every Tree that the Airy Chori&s;ters made their
Charming Choir, trembles, and is extirpated at the rebounding Ec|cho
of the alarming Drum; and tho&s;e &s;lender Fences only de&s;igned
to oppo&s;e the <HI>Sylvian</HI> Herd, are thrown down to erect others of a
more War-like Force. But all this not in one day.</P>
<P>It was &s;ufficient at fir&s;t for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to make preparations for a
growing Strength, though at pre&s;ent &s;uch as might offend as well

<P>Upon his decea&s;e Captain <HI>Gary</HI> was impowered by the King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern|ment tran&s;|ferred to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company.</NOTE> who
began to act as Vice-Roy, carrying his Chair of State about with

Pride, and in the ca&s;ting up Accounts, not available to him, only to
the Commanders of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, who by their own Adven|tures
made good Improvements; and the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company there|by
began to be &s;en&s;ible that their Trade would be impaired in the
vending their Commodities at home, and their Ships in <HI>India</HI> little
bettered by the King's Port in <HI>India;</HI> and above all, they being lia|ble
to be Sufferers for the Ho&s;tilities committed by his Maje|&s;ty's
Officers on the <HI>Indians</HI> (who under&s;tand no di&s;tinction between
King and Company) they as freely &s;upplicated for, what his Maje&s;ty
was as willing to grant, the I&s;land: They holding it, from that time,
of his Maje&s;ty about four years after the King had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, they

makes them &s;tomach a hard Service under harder Ma&s;ters: For be|&s;ides
that natural Antipathy betwixt the Subtilty of the one, and Ge|nero&s;ity

on this new acquired Power thrown into their hands, Men, mo&s;t

<PB N="65" REF="50">
conceive, as well from the incoherence of Di&s;po&s;itions, as the Lordly
Government of a Servant, what Grudges or Mi&s;carriages may be
produced? For where the Soldiers and Generals have different Inte|re&s;ts,
and mutual Obligation is interrupted, the cour&s;e of things
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily run-counter: Moreover, where they &s;hould be mo&s;t
eminent in Dangers and A&s;&s;aults, and lead them on to bold Enter|prizes;
yet if a tenderne&s;s to Self-pre&s;ervation &s;tep in between the
Publick Honour and Safety, (as it always does, where that bane to
Noble Actions, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, is concomitant) and which is almo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential to a Merchant, a fear of being laught at for venturing too
far; the Ca&s;e is de&s;perate. For In&s;tance, Our Ten Ships, mo&s;t of
them hired by Merchants, and the Commanders &s;ome of them (not
to &s;ay all, for there were of them as worthy Men as any in the World)
Principal Owners, were more willing to &s;hift for them&s;elves, than
to hazard a &s;tout and unanimous Re&s;i&s;tance: Which had they main|tained
boldly, as they imprudently gave the fir&s;t On&s;et (by the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
own confe&s;&s;ion) they had gained a Victory never to be &s;u|&s;tained
by them, nor for our Fleet &s;ufficiently to have been recom|pen&s;ed;
whereas for want of wi&s;e Conduct, and a joint Defence, they
impre&s;&s;ed on them&s;elves and Nation a Blur never to be wiped off.
Yet &s;uch, by the Con&s;titution of the Company it &s;elf, is the pre&s;ent
Misfortune, that in&s;tant Gain is preferred before Glory or a future emo|lument;
which is the rea&s;on, why they are le&s;s &s;olicitous for &s;etling
by Power, what they mu&s;t ever be forced to beg, a Trade; and com|ply
with Injuries, than command a Submi&s;&s;ion, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do: But
here al&s;o being left Tenants at will, they think it enough to leave Bu|&s;ine&s;s
in no wor&s;e plight than they found it.</P>
<P>And here might be con&s;idered, Whether it were not more for the
Publick Welfare, &s;hould His Maje&s;ty be plea&s;ed to make it a Royal
Company, or a National Concern, as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> is; than to
let it be at the will of the Company under the forementioned Cir|cum&s;tances

<P>At the end of the Town looking into the Field, where Cows and

<P>The People that live here are a Mixture of mo&s;t of the Neigh|bouring

being here taken of them: Others perhaps invited hither
(and of them a great number) by the Liberty granted them in

Popperies (a Toleration con&s;i&s;tent enough with the Rules of Gain),
though both <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> de&s;pi&s;e us for it; here licen&s;ed out

the World. Of the&s;e, one among another, may be reckoned 60000
Souls; more by 50000 than the <HI>Portugals</HI> ever could. For which
Number this I&s;land is not able to find Provi&s;ions, it being mo&s;t of it
a Rock above Water, and of that which is overflowed, little hopes to
recover it. However, it is well &s;upplied from abroad both with
Corn and Meat at rea&s;onable Rates; and there is more Fle&s;h killed
for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> alone here in one Month, than in <HI>Surat</HI> for a Year

the Climate being extremely Unhealthy; at fir&s;t thought
to be cau&s;ed by <HI>Bub&s;ho,</HI> rotten Fi&s;h; but though that be prohibited,
yet it continues as Mortal: I rather impute it to the Situation,
which cau&s;es an Infecundity in the Earth, and a Putridne&s;s in the
Air, what being produced &s;eldom coming to Maturity, whereby
what is eaten is undige&s;ted; whence follows Fluxes, Drop&s;y, Scur|vy,
Barbiers (which is an enervating the whole Body, being nei|ther

living at large, not debarring them&s;elves Wine and Strong Drink,
which immoderately u&s;ed, inflames the Blood, and &s;poils the Milk
in the&s;e Hot Countries, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> long ago declared. The Natives
abhor all heady Liquors, for which rea&s;on they prove better Nur&s;es.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Mortality to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air a|greeable to the Country Peo|ple.</NOTE> the Country Peo|ple

we are here, as Exotick Plants brought home to us, not agreeable to
the Soil: For to the Lu&s;tier and Fre&s;her, and oftentimes the Tem|perate&s;t,

their former Condition: When it is expo&s;tulated, Is this the Reward

el&s;e if he mu&s;t be full grown for Mi&s;ery, how much more compa&s;&s;io|nate
were it to expo&s;e him to an open Combat with the fierce&s;t Duel|li&s;ts
in Nature, to &s;pend at once his Spirits, than to wait a piece|meal'd
Con&s;umption? Yet this abroad and unknown, is the ready
Choice of tho&s;e to whom Poverty threatens Contempt at home:
What el&s;e could urge this wretched Remedy? For the&s;e are untrodden
Paths for Knowledge, little Improvement being to be expected from
Barbarity. Cu&s;tom and Tradition are only Venerable here; and it
is Here&s;y to be wi&s;er than their Forefathers; which Opinion is both
bred and hatch'd by an innate Sloth; &s;o that though we &s;eem near|er
the Heavens, yet Bodies here are more Earthy, and the Mind
wants that active Fire that always mounts, as if it were extingui&s;h'd
by its <HI>Antipari&s;ta&s;is:</HI> Whereby Society and Communication, the

an Ingenuous Man's, who &s;hould not defile his purer Thoughts, to
<PB N="70" REF="53">
be wholly taken up with &s;uch mean (not to &s;ay indirect) Contem|plations;
however, a nece&s;&s;ary Adjunct, <HI>Wealth,</HI> may prove to buoy
him up on the Surface of Repute, le&s;t the Vulgar &s;erve him as <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s
Frogs did their fir&s;t rever'd Deity.</P>
<P>Thus much being premi&s;ed for what concerns the I&s;land its &s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Credit it bears with its Neigh|bours.</NOTE> it
remains to &s;peak of it with relation to the Credit it bears among its
Neighbours: The <HI>Dutch</HI> ca&s;t an envious Eye on it, and were it in
their hands, would doubtle&s;s make it render all it is capable; and in
re&s;pect of Commerce it &s;eems to offer many Conveniences; the <HI>Ba|nyans</HI>
liking it better than <HI>Surat,</HI> living freer, and under milder Taxa|tions,
which they put the pre&s;ent Pre&s;ident in &s;ome hopes of com|plying
with, could he open the way from hence up the Country:
but that depending on &s;o many Intricacies, mu&s;t be not only a work
of Time, but Power to bring to pa&s;s; as afterwards may fall more
properly in our way to make appear.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent Concern then is with the <HI>Portugal, Seva Gi,</HI> and the <HI>Mo|gul:</HI>
From the fir&s;t is de&s;ired no more than a mutual Friend&s;hip; from
the &s;econd, an Appearance only; from the la&s;t, a nearer Commerce:
The fir&s;t and &s;econd become nece&s;&s;ary for Provi&s;ions for the Belly,

Offices of Civility mu&s;t be performed to each of the&s;e; but they
&s;ometimes interfering, are the occa&s;ion of Jealou&s;ies; the&s;e three
being &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite one to another: For while the <HI>Mogul</HI>

Offence; on the other hand, the <HI>Mogul</HI> would &s;oon put a &s;top to all

upon Chri&s;tians, which they wi&s;ely make an Inqui&s;ition Crime.</P>

to their Procurator <HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> (who&s;e reception was very kind)
and delivered him his Honour's Letters; &s;hewing him the &s;everal
Pre&s;ents they brought for the <HI>Rajah,</HI> and Mini&s;ters of State; of which
he highly approved, and promi&s;ed them to help them to the <HI>Rajah</HI>'s
pre&s;ence, as &s;oon as conveniently he could after his return from Pil|grimage
to <HI>Purtaabgur:</HI> And bad them re&s;t content, that his Endea|vours
&s;hould be totally employed in the Honourable Company's In|tere&s;t,

brought for the <HI>Rajah</HI> to &s;ign, tran&s;lated into <HI>Moratty</HI> Language;
which he &s;aid he would peru&s;e, and then give his judgment of them.

of a Peace betwixt the <HI>Rajah</HI> and the <HI>Syddy</HI> of <HI>Banda Rajapore;</HI>
urging many Arguments to create in him a belief it would be for the
<HI>Rajah</HI>'s advantage, but he would not be per&s;uaded it was for his Ma|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er's

<P>Our Amba&s;&s;ador replied, The Pre&s;ident had no other De&s;ign in
making this motion, than that of a good Neighbour; having ob|&s;erved
the Mi&s;eries each Party endured, and the general ob&s;truction
of Trade, occa&s;ioned by the War; but &s;ince he de&s;ired him to de&s;i&s;t
mentioning it to the <HI>Rajah,</HI> he &s;hould not trouble him therewith; but
what was more con&s;i&s;tent with our own and his Intere&s;t; which was
the encouraging Trade and Merchandi&s;e in his Country, and opening

<P>To which he an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Offici|ou&s;n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a Chief Mini|&s;ter of State to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></NOTE> That he doubted not but it would be ef|fected

The next day they receiv'd order to a&s;cend the Hill into the Ca&s;tle,
the <HI>Rajah</HI> having appointed an Hou&s;e for them; which they did;
leaving <HI>Puncharra</HI> about Three in the Afternoon, they arrived at the

<P>It is fortified by Nature more than Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rairce</HI> a &s;trong Hill.</NOTE> being of very difficult

Ba&s;tions thereto: All the other part of the Mountain is a direct Pre|cipice;
&s;o that it's impregnable, except the Treachery of &s;ome in it
betray it. On the Mountain are many &s;trong Buildings, as the <HI>Ra|jah</HI>'s
Court, and Hou&s;es of other Mini&s;ters, to the number of about

the Peace was concluded. Our Amba&s;&s;adour replied, that was our

to procure the &s;ame Articles and Privileges we enjoyed in <HI>Indo&s;tan</HI>
and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where we traded. He an&s;wered, it is well, and referred
our Bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Moro Pundit</HI> his <HI>Pe&s;hua,</HI> or Chancellour, to examine
our Articles, and give an account what they were. He and his Son
withdrew into their private Apartments, to con&s;ult with the <HI>Brach|mines</HI>

that if he &s;hould be forced to &s;tay the whole Rains out at <HI>Rairee,</HI> the

&s;hall be Lo&s;ers; but if our Coin be as fine an Allay, and as weighty

he could not grant without breaking a Cu&s;tom has la&s;ted many Ages:
The re&s;t of our De&s;ires he willingly conceded, embracing with

<HI>Narun Gi Pundit</HI> did not altogether de&s;pair of obtaining our Wrecks,

nearer, even to the Foot of the Throne, where being Ve&s;ted, they were
de&s;ired to retire; which they did not &s;o &s;oon, but they took notice
on each &s;ide of the Throne there hung (according to the <HI>Moors</HI>

an Emblem of Ju&s;tice; and as they returned, at the Palace Gate
&s;tood two &s;mall Elephants on each &s;ide, and two fair Hor&s;es with

&s;upply them with what Goat they &s;hould expend (nothing el&s;e here
being to be gotten for them), which he did accordingly, to the con|&s;umption
of half a Goat a Day, which he found very profitable for
him, and thereupon was taken with a Curio&s;ity to vi&s;it his new
Cu&s;tomers; to whom, when he came, it was told them, The ho|ne&s;t
Butcher had made an Adventure up the Hill, though very old,

<HI>Carracks,</HI> &s;eldom u&s;ed to part without the lo&s;s of one or both. Nay,
the long-liv'd People yet at <HI>Swalley,</HI> remember a notable Skirmi&s;h
betwixt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> there, wherein they were neatly
intrapp'd; an Ambu&s;cado of ours falling upon them behind in &s;uch
&s;ort, that they were compelled between them and the Ships in the
Road, to re&s;ign mo&s;t of their Lives; and gave by their Falla me|morable
Name to a Point they yet call <HI>Bloody Point,</HI> for this very
rea&s;on. But &s;ince the&s;e Sores are fortunately bound up in that Con|jugal

all foul Words and Blows a&s;ide, let us &s;ee how the Affairs &s;tand be|twixt
them and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who followed our Steps, and got in at
the Breach we made. They made them more Work, not only beat|ing
them out of their <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of all
their Trea&s;ures of Spice, and have ever &s;ince kept them, with all
their Strong-holds, as far as <HI>Goa;</HI> they only enjoying the Gold Trade
of <HI>Mo&s;ambique</HI> undi&s;turbed; the <HI>Japanners</HI> having bani&s;hed both
their Commerce and Religion.</P>
<P>Wherefore our Ships almo&s;t alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compa|ny enrich this Port.</NOTE> were it not for a little the
<HI>French</HI> of late, lade Calicuts for <HI>Europe:</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Factory
here, that vend the Spices they bring from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and inve&s;t part
of the Money in cour&s;e Cloath, to be di&s;po&s;ed among their Planters,
or &s;old to the <HI>Malayans,</HI> and &s;end the re&s;t back in <HI>Rupees:</HI> So that we
&s;ingly have the Credit of the Port, and are of mo&s;t advantage to the
Inhabitants, and fill the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e with the &s;ub&s;tantiale&s;t In|comes.
But not to defraud the <HI>French</HI> of their ju&s;t Commendations,
who&s;e Factory is better &s;tor'd with <HI>Mon&s;ieurs</HI> than with Ca&s;h, they
live well, borrow Money, and make a Shew: Here are <HI>French
Capuchins,</HI> who have a Convent, and live in E&s;teem.</P>
<P>And here I might conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diamond Trade better in the hands of the Com|pany's Ser|vants than in theirs.</NOTE> did not the Diamond Trade and other
Jewels interpo&s;e; which I could wi&s;h for the Company's &s;ake might
never be &s;truck out of their Indulgence allowed to their Servants:
For it will never amount to Advantage in their hands, becau&s;e the

&s;natching at a Prize, which none is &s;en&s;ible of, but the private Buyer;
but when they are publickly Invoiced, it will be at their own Wills to
make their Bargains. Withal, in the Company's Servants hands, it

the Company: Whereas &s;hould they retract this, not only the <HI>Jews</HI>
would find others to furni&s;h them, as the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> with
their Encomiendums; but other Monied Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI>

good Gainers too; and all this while no Prejudice done either to
Freight or the Company's Trade; which if they will not believe, let
them experiment to their own Co&s;t. Nor can I &s;ay more on this Sub|ject,
than both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Jewellers coming over Land do un|der&s;tand,

its Pu&s;ilanimity: The Veins and Arteries were filled with Currents

<P>What has been Experienced in the particular Accounts, I mu&s;t

the middle of <HI>June,</HI> in which times, Empyemas, Fluxes, Fevers of
all &s;orts (except Pe&s;tilential) Haemorrhages, rage; after the Rains
are fully &s;ettled, it grows Healthy. From the &s;etling in of the
Rains till the Full Moon in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> it Rains without intermi&s;&s;ion, after
which it clears up for a Fortnight, and with little variation (bating
the accidental Cau&s;es of its beginning earlier or later) it Rains all
<HI>September</HI> till the <HI>Elephant</HI> breaks up, the la&s;t Rainy Star: After
which is the Harve&s;t for Rice, when it is gathered; and then ju&s;t af|ter
the Rains they are mo&s;t Sickly, the Sun exhaling Vapours, the
Earth grows Muddy and Stinking, though abundantly Productive:
From thence to the latter end of <HI>January</HI> commences the Cold Sea|&s;on,
when their Bodies are Healthier, and a lovely Verdure Cloaths
the Earth; at the latter end of this they reap another Harve&s;t with|out
extraordinary pains; all this time the Evenings are very &s;harp,
and at <HI>Surat</HI> I have &s;een an hoar Fro&s;t in the Morning. From <HI>Fe|bruary</HI>
the fir&s;t, till the Rains &s;et in, are the Heats, and in <HI>March</HI> the
Leafs fall off the Trees, yet always &s;upplied with fre&s;h, &s;o that the
Trees are always Green, though the Gra&s;s and Fodder are quite
burnt up; and with difficulty, by the advantage of Aquiducts, a
lean Harve&s;t is brought forth: The Pea&s;ants Morning and Evening
draw Water out of Wells by <HI>Buffola</HI>'s, or Oxen; or el&s;e by a
thwart Po&s;t poi&s;ed with a &s;ufficient weight at the extremity, laid
over one fixed in the Earth; the Water is drawn by a Bucket of Goats
Skins; others have Pans or Buckets of Leather hanging round about
a Wheel, &s;ome always in the Water, others ri&s;ing up, and at the
&s;ame time others pouring out as the Wheel turns round: And thus
are their be&s;t Gardens kept alive.</P>

out by the &s;tiff Tendons of the <HI>Linea Alba,</HI> as by the mo&s;t accurate

Columns by turns. The Aetiology whereof I think to be this; that
while all the Contents of the Belly are moved upwards, all Re&s;piration
is expelled, only the voluntary Motion of the Animal Spirits acts
upon the Nerves (the Mind or Soul commanding them) while the
Vital or Natural are compelled to the contrary.</P>

<P>Care is to be taken likewi&s;e in Choice of Rough Diamonds, to avoid

were filed with a rough File.</P>
<P>For vending, Stones of &s;ix Grains and under, to one and a half,

<P>For Trial of a Diamond, take a Pointed Diamond, &s;uch as Glaziers

<P>The Diamond that is Sandy, or hath any Foulne&s;s in it, or is of a Blue,

<P>Take the Mould of the Stone you would buy, which having moulded,
ca&s;t it off in perfect Lead, then make a Patern of it; but before you go
about to make a Patern (of the Stone you would cut) weigh the Lead,

and &s;et down the Weight in a Piece of Paper; then form the Piece of
Lead to what fa&s;hion you think be&s;t and mo&s;t advantagious to the Stone;

may find what the Stone will lo&s;e in cutting. The Lead will weigh three

<HEAD>Valuation of Diamonds.</HEAD>
<P>There is a Rule acurately to be ob&s;erved, which is this; A Stone of
one <HI>Carrack</HI> is worth 10 <HI>l.;</HI> to value 2 <HI>Carr.</HI> multiply <HI>per</HI> 2, which makes
4, and that 4, <HI>per</HI> 10, the Price of 1 <HI>Carr.</HI> which makes 40 <HI>l.:</HI> So for
3 <HI>Carr.</HI> 3 times 3 is 9 <HI>Carr.</HI> and 9 times 10 <HI>l.</HI> is 90 <HI>l.</HI> This for even <HI>Car|racks</HI>
comes neare&s;t the true Value; but for &frac12; or &frac14; of a <HI>Carr.</HI> although a
Stone of 2 <HI>Carr.</HI> be worth 40 <HI>l.</HI> yet in this Rule and way of reckoning
(meaning &frac12; a <HI>Carr.</HI> &s;o valued) it is valued at but &frac14; of a <HI>Carr.</HI> which is
50 <HI>s.</HI> and &frac14; of a <HI>Carr.</HI> but at &frac14; of 50 <HI>s.</HI> although a &s;ingle Stone, containing
a Crain, or &frac14; <HI>Carr.</HI> is worth 30 <HI>s.</HI> As for Example: You would know
what a Stone of 6 Grains is worth; 6 Grains is 3 &frac12; <HI>Carr.</HI> 3 times 3 is 9,
and 9 times 50 <HI>s.</HI> is 22 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> which is the Value of the Stone of 6 Grains.

<P>Beginning to &s;et forward, neither Tract nor Road was followed,
all being covered with Sand; but our Guides &s;teered by their own
Experience; this was not &s;o comfortable, to behold nothing but a

&s;teer a more <HI>Northern</HI> Cour&s;e, from whence to reflect what Su&s;tenance

of their full Maturity; at which time they look for the &s;ame
Unhealthine&s;s we do in our Autumn; though I find them not &s;o &s;u|per&s;titiou&s;ly
addicted to Symbols, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> to their Hiero|glyphicks,
yet they expre&s;s the Year by this Tree; becau&s;e this
Tree, &s;ay they, of all others alone (which I before noted of the
Coco-Nut Tree, and therefore I think it a kind of Palm) at every
appearance of the New Moon procreates a fre&s;h Branch, by which
Twelve Productions the whole Year is re&s;embled and compleated;
the Trees are Tall and Slender, bearing their Boughs all a top, like a
&s;hady Tuft, &s;ome &s;tanding bolt upright, and others &s;pread abroad,
with others flagging and ready to give way to the Birth of more;
when they are Young and in their Infancy, they no &s;ooner &s;prout
up but the prickly Leafs guard its tender Head, which is of a pithy
&s;ub&s;tance, and when Wounded &s;poils the Trees Growth, &s;o that it
Dies; but while it e&s;capes that danger, it ri&s;es by degrees after the

Boughs, whil&s;t a more lively Product makes them glad by a new

the Year.</P>

from the main Head is beheld a flouri&s;hing Peruke of Palms, fit
to be worn by the greate&s;t Heroes; from whence downwards without
any Sprouts, it appears all in Coat of Mail Cap-a-pee, or like a Pine-Ap|ple

Branches, by which compactne&s;s it emulates its Conelike Figure.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Trees there are Male and Female, and which is worthy our

before they are Impregnated at the Roots with the Seed of the Male,

to Drink out of their Tanks, newly filled, which was Thick,
Troubled, and Slimy; for which rea&s;on the Vapours, or rather
Fumes from the Sun's violence, were very Offen&s;ive, and the more
irk&s;ome, becau&s;e we were con&s;trained to tarry here another Night,
for that the River <HI>Rute Conna Shure,</HI> or Salt-Water, was now over|flown
by the Waters falling from the Mountains beyond the Barks
to that exce&s;s, that it could not be Forded by Travellers, and the
Stream ran with that Rapidne&s;s, that it was un&s;afe to venture over
till the de&s;cending Cataracts had left off pouring on the over&s;well'd
Brinks, and emptied them&s;elves into the wider Gulf, not many
Leagues di&s;tant hence.</P>
<P>The Day after, as &s;oon as we heard the Waters were abated, we
&s;et forward, and found it true what had been reported (Three <HI>Ca|phala</HI>'s

whether it would hold up &s;hould we tarry, which made us confide
on our Guides, who gave us a&s;&s;urance, that the Mar&s;hes were pa&s;&s;a|ble;
we were more troubled with Waves of Sand than Water, both
which, by Rain, or Wind, keep on their Cour&s;e with &s;ome noi&s;e till

an <HI>Aba&s;&s;in,</HI> had built an old Caravan, Twenty Miles from <HI>Cormoot;</HI>
where we met a <HI>Caphala</HI> of light A&s;&s;es going for the Port; and here
we were obliged to change more of our Camels, they being quite
tired.</P>
<P>In this Plain the Heats increa&s;ed upon us &s;o, that we could not

Long-Bridge over the Lake leading to the Gulph, who rai&s;ed him|&s;elf

gained for any of the&s;e, &s;eeing them halt and complain as much as

as the affirms, neither go they in Flocks or Herbs together;

much of the Nature of Veni&s;on both in their Ta&s;te and A&s;pect.

<P>To the Directions already given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Trial.</NOTE> I &s;hall add, That the true <HI>Bezoar</HI>

never fails but in the Adulterate; and if the upper Coat being &s;ha|ved
ff, there &s;ucceed not another Round, as is vi&s;ible in Onions,

<P>But the following Method will better betray the Cheat, becau&s;e
they leave nothing unattempted to impo&s;e upon the Buyers: If you
<PB N="239" REF="139">
rub the Stone with a little Lime, and if in the chafed Part there ap|pears
a Purple Colour, it declares it true and genuine, without &s;ophi|&s;tication.
Or if you ca&s;t them into a Ba&s;on of Water, after an ex|act
Account is taken of their Weight, and they be taken out Three
Hours after, and weighed again, and it an&s;wer the fir&s;t Account, nei|ther
lo&s;ing nor gaining by their &s;tay in the Water, then pronounce
them right: But if being rubbed with Lime they chance to crack, or
a Flaw be made in the Trial, or that they alter upon their Im|mer&s;ion
in the Water, you &s;lander them not, if you &s;ay they are

<P>The Occa&s;ion whereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cau&s;e of their Blind|ne&s;s.</NOTE> as they report, is, becau&s;e little pretty

<P>And now it was plea&s;ant to behold the Harve&s;t-men labouring
with their Sythes, the Wheat blading low; the Ruther Bea&s;ts with
di&s;tended Bags grazing in the Meadows, the Sheep with their broad
Tails gathered into Folds, and the wary Shepherd on his Guard to
defend them, as well as to dre&s;s them when infected with any Ma|ladies;
the Groves look'd Green, as in the mid&s;t of Summer's Pride,
who&s;e Bowers the Winged Chori&s;ters made chearful with their un|confined

placed a <HI>Caravan Ser Raw;</HI> but here we were forced to gather tho&s;e

<P><PB N="245" REF="142">

intending to have been quiet, we were interrupted more than ever
by impertinent Gnats and Flies, by rea&s;on of the Concour&s;e of Wa|ters

of a Miracle performed by <HI>Band Haimero,</HI> the Prophet who
gave Name and Credit to this Plain, and con&s;equently to the Bridge
athwart this River, which is a thing beyond Human reach to effect,

<P>This Prophet was one of the Twelve Apo&s;tles, or Succe&s;|&s;ors

he leading an Ho&s;t this way, after a notable de&s;cent of Rain, which

that there be &s;ure Footing for my Ho&s;t;</HI> to whom it readily obey|ing,
became an high Road for his Soldiers to pa&s;s over dry &s;hod:
But when after this device he had Ferried over his Multitude, it was
told him an huge Ca&s;m, or Hell-Kettle was left where the Mountain
had emptied its &s;elf; not being much concerned at the Accident, and
meeting a Country Fellow who by chance had a Chee&s;e, he ca&s;t it
into the Well; which was not filled &s;o, but that it gave occa&s;ion to

wheeled off in the Dusk, but with an intention to take us napping
when we were in our Lodgings at <HI>Meergo&s;coon,</HI> Twelve Mile off the

which Plain dealing &s;eems mo&s;t an end to be their only Guard; for
they being alarmed by the Rogues that dogged us, ro&s;e immediately
in our defence, and gave us notice of our Danger, after one of the
Villains, on pretence to light his Pipe, had rudely broke in upon us,
to di&s;cover in what Po&s;ture we were, who perceiving their Pains
would be only Blows, gave us no farther di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>However we were the more willing on this account to get up by
the crowing of the Cock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;epolis <HI>now</HI> Chulminor.</NOTE> to pur&s;ue our Journy to <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> who&s;e
Ruins we had reached by Break of Day; when having compa&s;&s;ed
its Marble Foundations (being above, an Area of a large Extent, on
the Plain an high Wall, giving &s;ome Pains to the attollent Mu&s;cles of
the Neck, to give the Eyes leave to reach its Height), we clambred
a &s;pacious Stairca&s;e united &s;ome part of the Way up, when on each
hand it led to the &s;everal Apartments two different Ways; at top
were the Portals, and the Heads of the Columns worn with Age
(<HI>damno&s;a enim quid non imminuit dies</HI>) which con&s;umes every thing;
who&s;e Bodies were <HI>Corinthian,</HI> but the Pede&s;tals and Capitals of <HI>Do|rick</HI>
Order, as might be gained from what had re&s;i&s;ted the corroding
Jaws of Time, hardly lifting up their Reverend Crowns, though
of mo&s;t durable Stone.</P>
<P>Being entred the <HI>Pomaerium</HI> of <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> Hall (if Faith be to be
given to the mo&s;t Learned of the&s;e Relators), at the Hall Gates we
encountred two horrid Shapes both for Grandeur and Unwontedne&s;s,
being all in Armour, or Coat of Mail, &s;triking a Terror on tho&s;e

and might pa&s;s for &s;uch, had not huge Wings made them flying Gryf|fons,
and their Bulk and Hinder-Parts exceeded the large&s;t Ele|phants.</P>
<P>In this Augu&s;t Place only Eighteen Pillars of Forty remain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stocks build on the Pillars.</NOTE> about
Fifty Foot high, and half an Ell Diameter, of the di&s;tance of eight
Paces one from another, though we could count the Twenty two
Ba&s;es; which agree with the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Memoirs, who therefore &s;till
call it <HI>Chulminor, The Palace of Forty Pillars:</HI> The&s;e may be &s;een on
the Plain a great way, and at pre&s;ent are the Re&s;idence only of the

<P>Beyond the&s;e, many Pieces and Scraps of Antiquity offer us a

which was Eighty Foot Square, where on the Fragments of
Walls &s;tanding, and over the Porticoes e&s;pecially, were mo&s;t curi|ou&s;ly
cut out of delicate White Shining Marble, Men in Military
Habit, like the Old <HI>Grecian Phalanx</HI> (if there be leave for Con|jecture)
encompa&s;&s;ing a Monarch repre&s;ented &s;itting on his Throne,

Becau&s;e neither <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> nor after him <HI>Plutarch,</HI> mention
the reedifying this Palace either by <HI>Alexander</HI> or any of his Cap|tains,
yet I cannot let it pa&s;s without this Remark, That they are
habited more like the Ancient <HI>Grecians,</HI> than <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> now are; be|&s;ides,
the Hair of their Heads is hanging down, and not tied up,
which is different from the Modern Fa&s;hion of this Country.</P>
<P>In this Apartment Eight Doors &s;eem to an&s;wer each other, Two
on each &s;ide of every Square; which Conformity is attended with
extraordinary Elegance and Workman&s;hip; the Roof &s;eems never to
have had any intervening Pillars, and whether the Beams were of
Cedar, it is not &s;o fortunate as to have a Voucher of its own Nation.
Many other Parts declared Co&s;t and Pains enough, but nothing
more worthy Study than the Characters fairly impre&s;&s;ed and engra|ven,
which would unfold the Truth of the Founders of this Build|ing,
were they as Intelligible as Legible; for they remain like the
Hand-writing on the Wall (<HI>Mene Tekel</HI>), till &s;ome Divine Expo|&s;itor
interpret them; yet I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, many of the Characters
may be found in the <HI>Greek</HI> Alphabet.</P>
<P>This va&s;t Fabrick is made bigger, by being joined to a great
Mountain, out of who&s;e Entrails were worn, rather than digged,
Noble Caverns with Stately Sculptures, and wide Ponds of living
Water con&s;tantly di&s;tilling from the Marble Rocks, either for bath|ing
or nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es: It is an admirable Piece, overlooking all the
Plain, where we took this day's Repa&s;t, and over Head &s;aw the
Corni&s;h of the Fronti&s;piece embelli&s;hed with the Royal Arms of the
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Emperor, immediately on the Union of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI>
into one Empire, which was a Ram's Head delineated as far as
the Che&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon we &s;aw another of the &s;ame Make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ram's-head the Arms of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE> an&s;wering
the other part of the Palace, and underneath on the Plain took no|tice
of Two Pillars at a fit di&s;tance, the one for the Goal, and the
other for the Starting-place of their Cour&s;ers when they run Races.
Having thus fini&s;hed our Perambulation, we de&s;cended on the con|trary

their Shoulders.</P>
<P>From whence ob&s;erving frequent Numbers of the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain whether it be <HI>Per&s;epolis.</HI></NOTE> I was apt to

we Travellers often do in this Journey out of choi&s;e, yet we found
it di&s;agreeable, becau&s;e the Nights now were as inten&s;ely Cold, as

&s;oiled by no Lake, River, or Standing Pools, nor near any Sea or
Gulph for &s;ome Hundreds of Miles; and to this Thinne&s;s of the

all the Year long are capped with Snow; from who&s;e Ribs the Sun
di&s;&s;olving them, is the only occa&s;ion of watering this Valley, where
no other Supply can be had, or not &s;o frequent as this; and his
hotte&s;t Rays are not powerful enough (as 'tis credibly reported by

which mu&s;t be acknowledged to be &s;et on Fire by Hell, whatever the
Extract that they Wor&s;hip as a Spark of the Sun, may be defended
to be. When they take away, they &s;trew the foul Cloth with Meal-Flower,
and the better to perpetrate their Ince&s;tuous Lu&s;ts, they
put out the Lights, and &s;hifting them&s;elves &s;tark naked, both Men

to catch as catch can; and whatever Lot they light on, the Lamps
being again lighted, they firmly embrace for their Lover, if it be
Father or Brother, or any other Relation: And which is &s;till wor&s;e,
the Night being &s;pent in Be&s;tiality, the na&s;ty Flower (which by
their Filthine&s;s either of Vomit or Excrement in which they wallow|ed
like Brutes) is kneaded into a Pa&s;t, and eaten as a Sacrament to re|peat
the &s;ame ungodly Fe&s;tival Annually, as if it were a Sacrifice
well-plea&s;ing to their Deities. But Propagation after this kind is as odi|ous

through the Fire is execrable and abhorrent to Nature: Which made
an Ancient Heathen, in dete&s;tation of &s;uch horrid Crimes offered as

<P>The Series after this Succe&s;&s;ion of Patriarchs, as it was immediate|ly
puddled with the Mud of Here&s;y, &s;o it often was di&s;turbed by
the Impo&s;ition of the Secular Power, forcing not only Ignorant but
Ungodly Men upon them; who now at this Time have their <HI>Conge
d' E&s;lire</HI> from a Prince of another Religion, and many times purcha&s;e
it by Simoniacal Contracts: So that the Purity of Chri&s;tianity can|not
be expected, where Gain is made of Godline&s;s, and the&s;e high
Cures of Souls are bought and &s;old; entring upon them with the
Emperor's Licen&s;e, not the Approbation of their own Clergy; not
by De&s;ert and Merit, but by Fraud and Circumvention: And where|as
Humility and Godline&s;s, Learning and Ingenuity, &s;hould be the
Qualifications, now Pride and Envy, great Gifts with Stupidity are
exalted: And which is mo&s;t deplorable, generally &s;uch Men are put
into the Patriarchates as are mo&s;t odious to them; whence it comes
to pa&s;s, that the&s;e Prelates have as little Integrity as Orthodoxy,
they favouring the <HI>Jacobites</HI> even to this day.</P>
<P>They are confident in the Super&s;titious Omens of the Heathens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Te|nents.</NOTE></P>

<P>And therefore Pray for the Dead.</P>
<P>Dete&s;t the Council of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI></P>
<P>They have Five Sacraments, leaving out Confirmation and Ex|treme

<P>They deny the Superiority or Primacy to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, and
they u&s;e this Interrogation for an Argument, <Q>Why rather That than
the Church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> in which City we were fir&s;t called Chri&s;tians,
by the Preaching of St. <HI>Peter?</HI></Q></P>
<P>They are again&s;t Purgatory. For which rea&s;on the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> affix
the Error of the <HI>Aba&s;&s;ins</HI> upon them, Of Cauterizing when they
Baptize Infants, or initiate any into the Church; according to the
Words of St. <HI>John, He &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with
Fire;</HI> taking the Words literally: Wherefore the <HI>Aba&s;&s;ins,</HI> not the
<HI>Armenians,</HI> are called St. <HI>John</HI>'s Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>They di&s;tribute the Euchari&s;t in both kinds to the People, in Com|memoration
of the Body of Chri&s;t, dipping the Wafer into the
Wine and Water mixed together, and then give it to the Commu|nicants.</P>
<P>They wrap the Word of God in a clean Piece of Silk, which
when the Prie&s;t unfolds, he ki&s;&s;es the Bible, and bows: The like
Ceremony is u&s;ed at the Elevation of the Ho&s;t, which he gives to all
alike to &s;alute, as al&s;o both the Te&s;taments.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Cu&s;toms and Opinions divulged and maintained by
their Patriarchs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Patri|archs in&s;tall'd with Pomp.</NOTE> to whom great Honour is paid; being introduced
into their &s;everal Sees as well by the Pomp of the <HI>Moors</HI> as the Solem|nity
of the Chri&s;tians: The <HI>Cauns</HI> of the Provinces conducting them
with all their Train, and Forces of Hor&s;e and Foot, with Banners
flying, and loud Mu&s;ick re&s;ounding, great Guns di&s;charging, and
all the Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy congratulating their In&s;talment, and the
King's Favour towards them.</P>
<P>The Clergy meet them in their &s;everal Habits; the Laity al&s;o &s;hew
their Gallantry, and the Patriarchs them&s;elves are in their Holy Ve&s;t|ments,
Rich Copes, Mitres, and Cro&s;iers, be&s;et with ine&s;timable
Jewels. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Bi&s;hops by wearing Rings
on their Fingers, embelli&s;hed with Diamonds, whereas the Bi&s;hops
wear only plain Gold Rings. Their Pontificals being put off, they
walk in a Black Gown with a Mitred Hood and Pa&s;toral Staff, as do
the <HI>Vortobeeds,</HI> who are the learned'&s;t and be&s;t e&s;teem'd of all their
<PB N="275" REF="157">
Orders, and in ab&s;ence of the Patriarch and Bi&s;hops exerci&s;e all the
Pontifical Functions: The&s;e are Eloquent Preachers in their Pulpits;
the&s;e only vow Cha&s;tity, and what is more &s;trict, endure not the
&s;ight of a Woman; and if in the Street by chance they meet one,
they pre&s;ently turn their Backs; and if they have any Bu&s;ine&s;s in
that part of the Church allotted them by Cu&s;tom, they commit not
them&s;elves to them, but cau&s;e them to be drove away, before they
will read the Service.</P>
<P>At <HI>Jelfa</HI> &s;ome Forty of the&s;e live a Celibate Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vortobeeds</HI> or Mona&s;ticks.</NOTE> at the Mona&s;try

<P>The other Orders of the Clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Clergy marry.</NOTE> whether Prie&s;ts, Deacons, Ca|nons,
or Chori&s;ters, u&s;e Chri&s;tian Liberty in re&s;pect of Matrimony,

no other ways from the Ru&s;ticks, than their wearing Blue Ve&s;ts,
Turbats, and Tunicks, as they do, unle&s;s a long Cloak, or Gown of
Black over all, points them out to be an <HI>Armenian</HI> Father, or an Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tick
in Orders: They are &s;haved as the <HI>Romans</HI> are, and unco|ver
their Heads in Salutation; they are con&s;tant Frequenters of their
Churches, and have Lamps always burning in them; and every one
takes his turn in the Order of the Prie&s;thood, to wait Day and Night
in the Temples, according to the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> In&s;titution, to whom are
appointed Lodgings adjoining to their Churches; at other Times
they live with their Families in the City: Every one approaching
them pays them a Reverence, and begs their Ble&s;&s;ing, ki&s;&s;ing the
Hem of their Garments, which the Prie&s;ts return to the <HI>Vortobeeds,</HI>
the <HI>Vortobeeds</HI> to the Bi&s;hops, and the Bi&s;hops to the Patriarchs.</P>
<P>Having been pre&s;ent at their Ma&s;&s;es for the Dead, for Infants in
Bapti&s;m, and for the Husband and Wife new-married; I &s;hall thence
take occa&s;ion to relate in &s;hort their Banquets, Fa&s;ts, and Ceremo|nies
u&s;ed on their Celebrating the&s;e Rites.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with their fir&s;t Admi&s;&s;ion into the Pale of the
Church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bapti&s;m.</NOTE> While they are at Divine Service a proper Ma&s;s is &s;aid,
when the Midwife or Nur&s;e brings the Child to Church, with a Tribe
of Women, where &s;he delivers it to the Godfather, who carries it to
the Mini&s;ter waiting at the Font on the Right Side beneath the Altar,
who unwinding the Swathes, receives the Infant naked, and his
Thumb being anointed with con&s;ecrated Oyl or Bal&s;om, &s;igns it
with the Sign of the Cro&s;s, not only on the Forhead, but on the
Brea&s;t and Back, Feet and Arms, and all the other Parts of the Bo|dy:
After this, pouring of the &s;ame Chry&s;m into the warm Water
in the Font, reciting &s;ome &s;pecial Prayers, and dipping the Crucifix
into it, it becomes an Hallowed Bath, in which the Babe is wa&s;hed
all over by the Prie&s;t: When it is taken out, it is cro&s;&s;ed from Head
to Foot, and &s;pitting into the Ears and Eyes it is di&s;mi&s;s'd with an
Amulet hung at its Brea&s;t for Eight Days, as a Charm again&s;t Witch|craft,
<PB N="276" REF="158">
and re&s;tored to the Women to be cloathed. The Ma&s;s being
done, the Gue&s;ts return to the Hou&s;e of the Parents, with a Noi&s;e
of Mu&s;ick before them, and the Choir in Proce&s;&s;ion &s;inging Anthems,
where they all make merry before they depart. If it be a Girl it is
E&s;pou&s;ed immediately after Bapti&s;m, to prevent its being &s;ent for into
the <HI>Haram</HI> by the Emperor, who pretends a Power over them to
chu&s;e for his own u&s;e out of tho&s;e not betrothed.</P>
<P>The great Fe&s;tivity of the Birth and Bapti&s;m of our Saviour, ob|&s;erved
on the 6^t^h of <HI>January,</HI> is celebrated with Rites of the like na|ture,
for they con&s;ecrate the Tank or Ci&s;tern, filled with Water and
Odoriferous Oyls, which, after the Sacrament received, is given out
among the People with great Clamour and Striving.</P>
<P>This Solemnity has been &s;o Splendid, that the Emperors and the
Court were wont to honour it with their Pre&s;ence, when they were
entertained with Interludes, and Repre&s;entations of the Birth, the
Morning being u&s;hered in with Vocal and In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick,
with Millions of Flambeaus, and &s;hewing the Angels and Shepherds,
with the Heavenly Ho&s;t, <HI>Singing prai&s;es to God on high, and good will
towards Men.</HI></P>
<P>When this was performed, the Rich Merchants &s;trove to expre&s;s
their Sen&s;e of the&s;e Favours, by inviting them to extraordinary Ban|queting
and Fea&s;ting; and after Expen&s;ive Repa&s;ts, the River being
con&s;ecrated for the purpo&s;e, the Ceremonies of Bapti&s;m were per|formed,
when notwith&s;tanding it is extreamly cold, tho&s;e of Riper
Years were baptized, and &s;wam about for the Diver&s;ion of the Court;
concluding all with a Night of Jollity.</P>
<P>The mode&s;te&s;t account of which Pranks mu&s;t be, The Hopes of
gaining Pro&s;elytes by &s;uch Shews, rather than to expo&s;e their mo&s;t
Holy Religion to the Contempt of Infidels, out of any De&s;ign or In|tere&s;t;
otherwi&s;e this Practice admits of a &s;candalous Interpretation:
But alas! it is too true in the affirmative, That in <HI>India</HI> among the
Idolatrous it might take, but among tho&s;e that abhor all manner of
Forms and Shapes in their Wor&s;hip, it turns to the Reproach, and not
Advancement of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The next thing after being Baptized,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matrimony.</NOTE> is to commit Matrimony,
the only way they have of propagating their Faith; it being a Pu|ni&s;hment
no le&s;s than Capital, to attempt by any means to per&s;uade a
<HI>Mu&s;&s;leman</HI> to abjure his be&s;otted Fancy concerning their Fal&s;e Pro|phet;
but that is not &s;o much the Rea&s;on, as prevailing Cu&s;tom,
which has from Age to Age led them to marry their Children very
young; chiefly becau&s;e the Advantage made by their Bargain is not
of &s;uch Concern as in <HI>Europe,</HI> where Portion, more than Hone&s;ty of
the Family, is con&s;idered; but here the greate&s;t Dowry is the Credit
of the Relations, and the Women not the Men make the Price, they
being Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of nothing more than their Beauty and Virtue; &s;o
that they never are &s;natch'd up for their Great Fortunes, however
Wealthy their Parents are, they being wholly at their Di&s;po&s;als who
make the Matches, without the Court&s;hip or Knowledge of the Cou|ple
to be married; wherefore they are entred into that &s;ort of Life
before they know how to get out of it; for they rarely pa&s;s their
<PB N="277" REF="158">
Childhood before they are tied in that indi&s;&s;oluble Band; whence
&s;ome Excu&s;e may be made, for the Prie&s;ts &s;o frequently taking Mo|ney
to Unmarry them; a thing I have heard more than once wi&s;h'd
for in other Countries, but in vain; though they promi&s;e to be as
liberal to the Par&s;on who had that Knack, as any one grieved with
the Gout, would be to the Phy&s;ician who had an infallible way to
Cure that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies enjoined by the Church are agreeable enough to
the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> In&s;titution: Returning home, the Wedded Pair are kept
clo&s;e up together for Forty Days, loaded with Ro&s;aries and Images,
and none &s;uffered to come at them, that are Strangers, nor the
Womankind to &s;peak to any but their Husband; le&s;t an evil Tongue
&s;hould have a Sorcerous effect, or a bad Eye &s;hould Inchant their fu|ture
Bli&s;s.</P>
<P>This <HI>Quadrage&s;&s;imal</HI> Re&s;traint being over (if no Fa&s;t intervene,
of which their Church is full) they prepare them&s;elves to Cele|brate
the Nuptials with their Kindred, which is on this manner:
The Elde&s;t of the Family on the Husband's &s;ide, opens the Fe&s;tival
by fir&s;t Inviting the Gue&s;ts to the Marriage Fea&s;t, where the Bride|groom
appears in a mean Dre&s;s and poorly Habited, till the Prie&s;ts
have received Richer Habiliments of the Grandfathers, or Elde&s;t
Uncles Gift, and brought them covered into the middle of the
Gue&s;t Chamber, where they Sanctify them and Ble&s;s them for his
u&s;e, the Youth &s;tanding by; to verify what <HI>Paladius</HI> u&s;ed for a Pro|verb,
<HI>Inve&s;tem Puerum qua&s;i imberbem,</HI> when he called a Beardle&s;s
Boy by the Epithet of an Undre&s;&s;ed Lad; and every one taking their
Places, the Servants lay them down on the Carpets, and unwinding
the Silk Embroidered for to wrap them in, di&s;cover only the Bride|groom's
Suit, with an old ru&s;ty Sword of the Family's, not worn
&s;ince <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> reduced them; for in the&s;e Countries it is not the
Cu&s;tom that Women of good Fame, or Repute, &s;hould meet in
Publick Conventions with the Men, but they Tran&s;act their own
Affairs in their own Hou&s;e of Parliament among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the Heels of the Servants come the Clerks with their Choir,
and taking the Cloaths, only one (which is all Cloth of Gold) being
the uppermo&s;t Garment, is a loo&s;e Coat of <HI>London</HI> Cloth, without
Sleeves, Lined with Sables to keep off the Winters Cold; when the
Reverend Sages call forth the new Married Stripling, whom they place
between Two Bridemen about his own Age, they all Three Kneel|ing,
while they Sing the <HI>Epithalamium,</HI> not &s;o much as lifting up
their Heads till all the Rites are fini&s;hed; then they wait on the Bride|groom
into another Room, whither his Robes are carried, and when
he is &s;hifted, he returns attended by his Bridemen; when every one
of them Salute the Hands of all that are called to this Solemnity,
and, after an Ancient Cu&s;tom, Invite them to take a Cold Ban|quet
among the Tombs, to put them in mind of Mortality at the
&s;ame time they are contriving to continue the World.</P>
<P>The Young Spark being lift up on Hor&s;eback, and &s;ome time
carefully held on each &s;ide on Foot, leads the way to the Cavalcade,
Riding in State, after a Noi&s;e of Fidlers, Drummers, Pipers, and
other Lacquies, Pages, and Footmen; after whom an innumerable
<PB N="278" REF="159">
Concour&s;e of Hor&s;emen follow to the Graves, near a Mile out of
the City (among whom are &s;ome very noble Sepulchres fit to re|ceive
&s;o great a Company) but in fair Weather they &s;pread their
Carpets, and &s;et up their Tents near the &s;ide of a Brook, almo&s;t
wa&s;hing their Burial place.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> having &s;hewn their good will to <HI>Venus,</HI>
(for it is known without them no hearty Sacrifice is paid her) <HI>Hymen</HI>
delivers out his Torches, the Sun having withdrawn his; and every
one there takes a Wax Light in his Hand, and Mounting, direct
them&s;elves towards the City, in the &s;ame manner they came out,
only Bonfires, Flambeaus, and Fireworks Illuminate the Road all
along: Entring <HI>Jelfa,</HI> the &s;tately Gates of their Friends and Rela|tions,
e&s;pecially &s;uch as are pre&s;ent at the Collation, are be&s;tuck with
Tapers in divers Coloured Paper Lanthorns; which look gracefully
and divert the Company with variety of Artful Fires, each &s;triving
to outvie others; and are Entertained at the &s;ame time with Wine
and Sweetmeats, Drinking of Healths, and at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;s'd with
fre&s;h Tapers given to all the Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>This continues in the Way to the Cathedral, where about Mid|night
the Bridegroom arriving, begs the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Archbi&s;hop,
and they hardly return to the Hou&s;e from whence they &s;et out, till
almo&s;t Break of Day.</P>
<P>Where they are &s;carcely compo&s;ed to Sleep, before the Father of
the Bride knocks on the &s;ame Errand, calling the Gue&s;ts to accept of
a Treat at his Hou&s;e; where tho&s;e Invited are carried into a noble
open Banquetting-Hou&s;e in a Garden, with Tanks and Adornments
very Magnificent, after their Fa&s;hion; the Room is Per&s;umed with
co&s;tly Odours, Smoaking out of Antick, Weighty, Silver Perfu|ming
Pots, or Pans; and being Seated, Voiders of Sweatmeats
(with a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Coat, as they call it) a Dram of Brandy is &s;et be|fore
every one; and then the Servants bring the be&s;t Raiments yet
pre&s;ented the Bridegroom, being the Father-in-laws, or his Repre|&s;entatives;
the Ceremonies are the &s;ame of the Clergy, only with
this addition, the Bridemen which Kneeled ye&s;terday, to day &s;tand
upright with flaming Flambeaus in their Hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ceremonies ended, and the Sweatmeats taken off, a Table
is &s;pread, and more than twice Seven Plates are differently Modified
to invite the Palate to Luxury; to which that of <HI>Muturantius,</HI> for
which <HI>Juvenal</HI> Lampoons him, is a mode&s;t piece of Temperance:
<Q><L>&mdash;Quis fercula &s;eptem</L>
<L>Secreto cenavit Avus&mdash;</L></Q>
But here are &s;uch loads of Provi&s;ions, that none need fear a quicker
Eye than Appetite, at lei&s;ure to take notice what each Eats; for
&s;hould they do nothing but devour, their Stomachs mu&s;t be cloied
before their Portions &s;ink.</P>
<P>Yet all the&s;e Preparations, with the enticing Poinant Sawces,
and provoking Pickles, prevail not on the Bridegroom to fall to,
till the Father-in-Law lays to his new Son's double Me&s;s, a Pur&s;e of
Gold; and this is the only thing they bear away by way of Dowry:
<PB N="279" REF="159">
After this Debt is cancelled, no Cloud appears to di&s;turb the Mirth,
Eating, Drinking, and facetious Di&s;cour&s;e is all the Bu&s;ine&s;s; and in
earne&s;t it is one, and a tedious one where it lavi&s;hes into &s;uch
Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>For what was reported of Old, &s;till holds good, The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>
Drink Wine in Bowls; and they ob&s;erve <HI>Gellius</HI> his Rule, <HI>de Lege
Caenarum,</HI> as a Law to their Fea&s;ts, <HI>Dum libenti&s;&s;ime edas, tunc aufer|tur,
&amp; alia e&s;ca melior atque amplior &s;uccenturiatur, i&s;que flos coenae ha|betur;</HI>
as if they never thought you Welcome before you had Eat
like a Glutton, and Drank like a Swine: After &s;hifting of Plates
unaccountably, and every one's Health has rea&s;on done it, they take
off the Table-Cloth, but not remove their Seats; Fruit, Wine, To|bacco,
and Salt Bits for a Whet, being placed before them, they
continue Drinking till Midnight, being diverted by Stage-Players,
Dancers, and Mountebanks all Day; nor will they them&s;elves di&s;|dain
to take up a Tabor and Roar out a Song behind that, and a
Flute Playing to them.</P>
<P>At Night Fireworks begin again, having had the con&s;tant ones of
the Water all the time, ari&s;ing in Crowns and Garlands, with other
Figures; at la&s;t they bring the News that the Matrons had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
the Bride Adorned with all her Wealth and Gallantry; when they
ri&s;e, but proceed not till &s;he is delivered to her Groom, who waits on
her to her Hor&s;e; when they are both Mounted, the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks
mar&s;hal the Proce&s;&s;ion; all the Streets are Illuminated, the loud
Drums and Trumpets proclaim their approach; in the Front is car|ried
a Tree full of Fruit; after it follows the <HI>Europeans,</HI> then the <HI>Ar|menians</HI>
in order; in the mid&s;t of them the Canonical Gentlemen
and Boys, &s;inging and Playing on Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, all in their
peculiar Habits, which were Rich, and the Choiri&s;ters Surplices full
of Red Cro&s;&s;es; after the&s;e the Bride and Bridegroom, He nobly
Mounted and &s;plendidly Accoutred with Magnificent Trappings;
his Hor&s;e led, and the Bride held on by Matrons, Cro&s;s-legg'd, after
the Country Fa&s;hion for Women to Ride, but Vailed all over with
a Saffron-coloured Vail;
<Q>Lutea demi&s;&s;os vel&acirc;runt flammea vultus.</Q>
Le&s;t if the Blu&s;hes of the Virgin Bride &s;hould be di&s;covered, or if too
high a Colour &s;hould be di&s;cerned in the Maiden Face, it may be im|puted
to the Vail, not the Floridne&s;s of the Cheeks; after all, in
the clo&s;e of the Proce&s;&s;ion, come the Matrons Attired in White
Sheets.</P>
<P>Nor do they go far before they repeat their Banquets, with Pre&s;ents

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Gives us a Sight of the Palace, and Rarities there; our Enter|tainment
by the French Arti&s;ans in the Emperor's Service;
the Diver&s;ions of the Place, and its Product; and the Clo&s;e

<P>HAving been taken up thus long among the <HI>Armenians,</HI> we in
our Return cannot but take notice of the famous Walk be|tween
the two Cities of <HI>Jelfa</HI> and <HI>I&s;pahaun:</HI> It is planted with two
Rows of Sycamores (which is the tall Maple, not the Sycamore of
<HI>Alkair</HI>) upwards of two Miles: It is called the <HI>Chaurbaug,</HI> from
Four Gardens belonging to the Palace, oppo&s;ite one to another;
the&s;e take up all the Ground on the &s;ide of the Bridge towards <HI>Spa|haun;</HI>
on the other &s;ide, Seats of Noblemen and Great Mini&s;ters of
State grace the Way up to the bigge&s;t of all, the Emperor's, which
is at the End of this Stately Place, over-looking with a plea&s;ant Pro|&s;pect
all the re&s;t up to the Palace-Gates, which are directly an&s;wer|ing
the Maje&s;tick ones of this Garden, they fronting one the
other.</P>
<P>Over the Portal are curiou&s;ly painted Men and Women in <HI>European</HI>
Dre&s;&s;es:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Garden at the end of the <HI>Chaurbaug.</HI></NOTE> From the Entrance up to the Mountains, Marble Steps make
the A&s;cent ea&s;y, which Nature had framed difficult enough other|wi&s;e;
up which the Limpid Streams are forced to &s;end their Currents
through Five &s;everal Channels laid with Marble, two at the feet of
the Sycamores, which railed in two Foot pads, and ran immediately
to the River; the other three emptied them&s;elves into the Tanks,
to which two Stone Cau&s;eways gave an Even Walk to Foot-men,
by the middle Channel parting them, and at every Tank a&s;cended
or de&s;cended by Marble Grades, while the Hor&s;e-way was &s;loped
for their Pa&s;&s;age, entring on one &s;ide, and coming back the other;
and every Two hundred Paces, Bathing-places of a large Circumfe|rence
receive great plenty of Water from the three Channels in the
middle, into which the Marble Steps go down to the Bottom, which
is paved with a cleanly Floor of the &s;ame Poli&s;hed Stones; and this
is begun from the beginning of the <HI>Chaurbaug,</HI> whence it de&s;cends
to the River, and thence ri&s;es the &s;ame height to the End of the Gar|den:
In the Garden its &s;elf, variety of Green Trees flouri&s;hing,
&s;weet Odors &s;melling, clear Fountains and Rivers flowing, charm
all the Sen&s;es; nor is there le&s;s &s;urprizal at the ravi&s;hing Sight of
the delicate Summer-hou&s;es by each Pond's &s;ide, built with all the
Advantages for Recreation and Delight.</P>

In a Wilderne&s;s beneath this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. VII.</NOTE> are kept the Bears, Leopards, and
Lions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Bea&s;ts for the Empe|ror's Diver&s;i|on.</NOTE> belonging to the Emperor: And from this place up to the
Palace Gate, are &s;een every Evening all the Gentry of the City
Riding to and fro with Hawks on their Fi&s;ts; managing their Steeds,
making of Matches for Shooting, Hunting, Cour&s;ing, or Hawk|ing;
&s;hewing their Gallantry in Apparel and Retinue, as well as
di&s;po&s;ition to Sport; being as much frequented as our <HI>Hide Park,</HI>
and for as little purpo&s;e, only to fee and be &s;een, though the whole
pretence be to take the Air.</P>
<P>Near the&s;e Ponds, or <HI>Tanks,</HI> are Coffee-Hou&s;es, which furni&s;h
them when they di&s;mount, with Coho, Tea, or Sherbets; while they
&s;it in State, and &s;moak Tobacco with their Attendance about them.</P>
<P>The adjacent Hou&s;es, Orchards, and Gardens, may be truly &s;aid
to be in the Virge of the Court, many of them &s;erving only for the
Emperor to &s;hift with his Seraglio, while the other Apartments are
Aired; though the great <HI>Divan,</HI> or Council be always held in that

Court: Wherefore reckoning all the&s;e Dwellings as Appendices
(which indeed they are) few Monarchs will appear to have a larger
extent to hold their Court in, it being above a Third part of the
whole City; which being granted, it will not be hard to imagine &s;o
Great and Ab&s;olute a Potentate &s;hould be Courted by all the World,
and from all the parts of the Earth the wonderful Works of the
Creation &s;hould be brought as Honorary Pre&s;ents; nor can it be &s;up|po&s;ed
that &s;o wide and &s;pacious a Palace &s;hould not afford room for
more than the ancient Ark, though not freight with Pairs of all the
Species, yet more of &s;everal.</P>
<P>Whence it is, that here is to be &s;een more readily, and with le&s;s
hazard, the Off&s;pring of mo&s;t Soils, except Human, and the Creatures
of every Nation, rather than the Women of this Court, which are
at le&s;s liberty than the Bea&s;ts, being Cooped up in their Sties, more
&s;trictly than the&s;e are kept in their Dens; many of the fierce&s;t and
untamed&s;t of the&s;e being allowed only to breath in the open Air as
Nature Ordained them: But not to tire my &s;elf, nor you with Parti|culars,
I &s;hall only mention what were &s;trange to me.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t whereof was the Rhinoceros,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rhinoce|ros, not the <HI>Indian Ouager.</HI></NOTE> who is a Cruel Bea&s;t,
of a large Size, there coming from his No&s;e an Horn a Cubit
long, (Brown towards the Bottom, Whiter near the Point)
and Six Inches Diameter, whence the derivation of his Name from
<HI>P&igrave;v, Na&s;us,</HI> a No&s;e, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Cornu,</HI> an Horn; between this Ani|mal
and the Elephant, is a mortal &s;trife, for which Nature &s;eems to
have armed it on purpo&s;e; it being a Four-footed Bea&s;t, with Three
Partings of the Hoof, built on thick &s;trong Thighs, but &s;hort, con|&s;idering
the great bulk of its Body which pre&s;&s;es them; it is Tall
enough to reach the Bowels of its Antagoni&s;t with its Horn, with
which it Gores him to Death; nor has &s;he given him le&s;s firm Bones
to the Trunk, if by chance it &s;hould be cru&s;hed by the Elephant, de|fending
its very Hide with a Coat of Mail; wherefore before on the
Neck and Shoulders, and behind in the Quarters, the Skin lies in
Folds, like Fi&s;h Scales, over one another; the Face bears much of
<PB N="288" REF="164">
an Hogs Countenance, unle&s;s the upper Lip, which re&s;emble a
Cows, and the lower, the form of a Whales; the Mouth di&s;covers a
mi&s;haped Tongue, &s;et about with Two rowes of Teeth; it is of the
&s;ame Mou&s;e Colour, and Tailed as an Elephant is, and Feeds of the
&s;ame Fodder, and is kept facing Two mighty, but lean Elephants.</P>
<P>Whether the Rhinoceros be the Unicorn, I &s;u&s;pend my belief,
&s;ince I have &s;een an Horn turned with Furrows and Ridges from the
Ba&s;is to the Point, and Tapering like that of our King's Arms: But
what <HI>Petrus Angelius</HI> relates concerning the <HI>Onager,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> A&s;s,
can have no congruity with this, unle&s;s in re&s;pect of the Virtues;
for though his Ver&s;es are mo&s;t Elegant in his 5. <HI>lib. Cyneget,</HI> yet the
de&s;cription is very wide:
<Q><L>&mdash;Quos India pa&s;cit Onagros,</L>
<L>Jam primum niveo corpus candore teguntur,</L>
<L>Infecti A&s;&s;yrio circum caput omne colore</L>
<L>Caeruleis oculis, unoque in fronte &s;uperbi</L>
<L>Cornu, &amp;c.</L></Q>
His words in Pro&s;e are the&s;e; <Q>The Wild A&s;&s;es of <HI>India</HI> are as big,
or bigger than Hor&s;es, who&s;e Heads are of a Purple die, their
Eyes Blew, the re&s;t of their Body White; on their Foreheads they
have an Horn a Cubit in length, who&s;e lower part for Two Hands
breadth is White, and the Top, which is &s;harp, inclining to a
bright Red, but the Middle part is blood Red; of the&s;e they make
Cups, out of which who&s;oever Drinks, neither Cramp nor Falling
Sickne&s;s &s;eizes them; nor has any manner of Poi&s;on any force, if
that immediately before or after taking of the &s;ame, either Water,
Wine,</Q> or other Liquid thing be taken out of the&s;e Cups.</P>
<P>That this Opinion is taken up upon the account of the Rhino|ceros
his Horn, I can certainly verify, and that great Prices are of|fered
for tho&s;e that are inadulterate; which they in <HI>India</HI> pretend to
try by the Liquors pre&s;ently fermenting in them; but notwith&s;tand|ing
that Experiment they are often deceived by fal&s;e Horns made
into drinking Cups; thus much is true of the Rhinoceros, but the
other part of it holds not Water; they come from <HI>Bengala,</HI> and are
e&s;teemed terrible and indomitable Creatures: And the&s;e mu&s;t be
(or none) what this Author calls A&s;&s;es, there being no other
Bea&s;ts in the&s;e Parts with but one Horn; and I am afraid he is mi&s;ta|ken
as to the <HI>African</HI> A&s;s al&s;o, &s;ome Writers having called <HI>Africa
India,</HI> which might have been urged in his excu&s;e, who&s;e Skin I
having formerly admired when in <HI>India,</HI> you will ea&s;ily be convinced
it is no &s;uch Creature, it having never an Horn; Two Live ones
were &s;ent hither from the <HI>Aba&s;&s;in</HI> Emperor, as an Expre&s;&s;ion of Re|&s;pect
to this Court; which, with other valuable Rarities brought by
his Amba&s;&s;adors, were lately graciou&s;ly received.</P>
<P>They are as large as a Mule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Aba&s;&s;in</HI> A&s;s mi&s;taken for the <HI>Sabean</HI> Wild A&s;s.</NOTE> but for the exact Symetry of the
Lineaments, <HI>Zeuxis</HI> his Pencil would but faintly &s;hadow over the
lively Portraicture of their Skins, the ground whereof was of a light
A&s;h Colour, over which along the Back &s;trait black Streaks in Rows
at length reached to the Tail; the Shoulders, Flanks, and Haunches
<PB N="289" REF="164">
had the &s;ame waving towards the extremity of their &s;everal Mem|bers;
but that which was the odde&s;t was on the Forehead, they had
&s;o many Geometrial Figures, like the <HI>Trapezium,</HI> or Square, in which
the oppo&s;ite &s;ides are parallel one with another, &s;o di&s;tinctly painted,
as at la&s;t to fill up a black &s;pot of a Diamond cut in the very Centre
of the Face.</P>
<P>What Family to mix this Kind with, I am at a lo&s;s, unle&s;s they
be a-kin to the <HI>Onager,</HI> or Wild A&s;s, mentioned by <HI>Xenophon</HI> in the
Expedition of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Cyrus;</HI> the &s;ame we read in <HI>Pliny</HI> in his
8. <HI>Lib.</HI> and 4^t^h <HI>Chap.</HI> where he a&s;cribes them to <HI>Phrygia</HI> and <HI>Lycao|nia;</HI>
but the Words of the before-recited Author have it thus; <Q>The
<HI>Onager</HI> is a Wild A&s;s, excelling at plea&s;ure the &s;wifte&s;t Cour&s;er;
who&s;e Fle&s;h differs not much from Stags Fle&s;h, were it not &s;ome|thing
tenderer;</Q> <HI>Arabia,</HI> &s;ays he, abounds with Flocks of them.
Now nothing can be Tamer than the&s;e before us, and therefore un|likely
to be the Wild ones of <HI>Xenophon</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> but are mo&s;t a&s;&s;u|redly
the Breed of <HI>Africa;</HI> however <HI>Petrus Angelius Bargaeus</HI> comes
pretty near the Mark in this, though not the other; however he is
mi&s;taken in the Place, as well as the Race of both:

<P>On the 19^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> an Eclyp&s;e of the Sun made us take notice
of the Alteration of the Weather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Eclyp&s;e of the Sun.</NOTE> which was &s;tormy and tempe&s;tu|ous;
as well as the lamentable plight all the <HI>Mahometans</HI> were in,
they &s;uppo&s;ing that Orb to be in Labour, and therefore by Pray|ers
and Incantations concerned at its Delivery, all the time beating
Pots of Bra&s;s, making a Noi&s;e as dreadful as the Day of Doom:
The Eclyp&s;e being over, the Weather cleared up again, as al&s;o the
Madne&s;s of the People was allay'd.</P>
<P>All <HI>September</HI> the Mornings and Evenings were &s;harp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Suburbs.</NOTE> and the
<HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Winds began to bring the Winter's Cold, though the Day-time
was Hot and Serene; wherein we made another Excur&s;ion
through the Suburbs on the farther &s;ide of the Court, to <HI>Jelfa,</HI>
through new <HI>Buzzars,</HI> finer and better Arch'd than tho&s;e in the City,
terminating in the Squares of divers Noblemen, who had reared
<PB N="293" REF="166">
them at their own Charge and Advantage; whereby they were
more Co&s;tly and Neat, broad enough for two Coaches to pa&s;s
abrea&s;t, though this City is unacquainted with tho&s;e Carriages; nor
indeed would they be convenient, by rea&s;on of the Narrow Streets
within, and Mountains without.</P>
<P>The&s;e brought us a long way to the River-&s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Third Bridge.</NOTE> adorned with
Dwellings of their Great Men, over which, to the Chri&s;tian Town,
lay another Bridge, inferior neither for Length, or Elegancy of
Structure, to either of the former two, but much later built. At
the Foot of it is a large Coppice of Willows, reaching a great way
by the Water-&s;ide; here the <HI>Jelfalines</HI> met us with their u&s;ual Noi&s;e
of loud Mu&s;ick, and led us directly up to a Mountain, where the
Emperors have digged a Grotto overlooking all the City, at their
Retirements hither &s;hading them from the Sun's Violence: This is
fabled to be al&s;o <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Throne, as we remarked before in <HI>Duccan;</HI>
others pretend it was projected by <HI>Darius,</HI> but for what end, unle&s;s
for a Pro&s;pect of this large place hid in a Wood, I cannot gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence in two days we compa&s;&s;ed the two Cities of <HI>I&s;pahaun</HI> and
<HI>Jelfa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">We were two days encom|pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Spa|haun.</HI></NOTE> taking more Ground by far than <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> with

Mules Loads of them expended every day: For though they have

if &s;uch va&s;t Quantities be brought out of the Country daily, be&s;ides
what may be planted within their own Walls, it may be concluded
&s;ome Thou&s;ands of Inhabitants contribute to the devouring of them;
though it mu&s;t not be credited what is &s;poken hyperbolically by the&s;e

<P>To &s;hut up therefore this Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall borrow an Indication
from the Tall Trees growing in a free Air; for from their bending
towards any Point of the Compa&s;s, thence is collected from what
Quarter of the Heavens the mo&s;t forcible and frequent Winds do
come, in what Region &s;oever they blow; &s;o Trees growing near the
Sea-&s;hore, incline towards the Land, but up-land in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> they
grow upright, which &s;hews no con&s;tant Winds to have any &s;uch In|fluence;
though from the <HI>Autumnal Equinox,</HI> the <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> u&s;hers
in the Wet Weather, to make way for the Fro&s;t and Snow till <HI>Decem|ber,</HI>
yet it is often variable, and veres to the <HI>East,</HI> when it is pinch|ing
Cold, from <HI>January</HI> to the middle of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t New Moon in <HI>October</HI> brings the <HI>Mu&s;&s;lemens</HI> Lent of <HI>Ra|mazan,</HI>
which hapned on the 10^t^h this Year, and was the &s;ame day
our Agent &s;et forth for <HI>Bunder,</HI> leaving me &s;ick behind. The 16^t^h
of <HI>November</HI> put an end to their Fa&s;t, and began a Day of Jubilee;
when the Leafs were all dropped off, and the Earth and Trees were
naked; after which, Bodies indi&s;po&s;ed &s;ue for a Writ of Ea&s;e, and
as the Winter is more piercing, they recover Health.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> locks up all in Ice and Snow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sharp Winter here.</NOTE> and con&s;tipates the Pores
of the Earth that it cannot be tilled; the Tops of Mountains are
all capped, and the Sharp Winds and Serene Air make it le&s;s tolera|ble
than in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it being ready to cut you through; though
then in the Sun it is &s;o warm, that the Poor are beholden to it for
their Stores: It &s;eldom &s;nows above three or four days together, but
that is &s;ufficient to load the Mountains, and to fill the Valleys for
many days, before it be di&s;&s;olved. And then it proves fatal to the
Hou&s;es built only of Mud; for whil&s;t they &s;eek to &s;ecure the Roof,
many times by &s;weeping it thence, the Snow melts at the bottom,
and undermines their Foundations, that oftentimes they become
mixt with the Dirt in the Streets.</P>

an Hearth Four&s;quare (not rai&s;ed, as in our College-halls), over
which is &s;et a Square, Low, but Large Table, whereon is thrown
a Quilt, and upon the Hearth is only &s;et an Earthen Pot of Char|coal;
<PB N="296" REF="168">
all the re&s;t of the Room is &s;pread with Beds and Quilts, into
which, whoever comes (after his Slippers are put off) he thru&s;ts
his Feet under the Quilt covering the Table; which way, though
it keep them warm, is prejudicial to the Nerves and Brain, by rea|&s;on
of the Mercurial Fumes ari&s;ing from the Charcoal; being obli|ged
to u&s;e that for want of plenty of Wood to Burn in Chimnies;
the Conveniency whereof they are unacquainted with, having ne|ver
&s;een any Chimney but what is in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory.</P>
<P>Their Kitchins are all over of a Smoak like our Malt Kills,
with &s;uch ventilating Tiles as they have, they rounding their Cook
Rooms with &s;mall Furnaces, &s;uch as our Chymi&s;ts make in their
Laboratories, &s;etting their Earthen, or Copper Pots thereon, not

dry barren Mountains, whence come fine, rare, and thin Bla&s;ts;

di&s;&s;olving the Snow as fa&s;t as it fell.</P>

our Interpreter, a <HI>Georgian</HI> Soldier, and a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Friar, joined us;

the Oranges, which are as good as grow, with our new <HI>Siras</HI> Wine,
exhilarating our &s;elves with the true Reli&s;h, and Natural Sweets of

<P>But the Checquer-work of this World prepared other Bu&s;ine&s;s for

Co&s;t and Pains: Here on the Tops of Mountains we only &s;aw the

the Sun by its powerful Heat another Quarter to &s;corch our Skin,

<P>After we had run this Gantlope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We begin to lo&s;e the Win|ter.</NOTE> the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Winds &s;etting in, the

rare, Gra&s;s, or rather a kind of Gra&s;s like our Mo&s;s, or &s;uch as we
&s;ee grow among Pavements after a Shower of Rain with us: This

commonly known among us, &s;uppo&s;ing at the &s;ame time the

<P>Sower Waters have for their Progenitors Vitriol and Alum, (not
the Smoke of Sulphur) either of which are imbued with Acidity or
Acerbity, whereas Sulphur enjoys neither; which is found true,
however the Chymical Spirit of Sulphur drawn off, as al&s;o of Salt,
become &s;o &s;harp. But to obviate that, If Sowerne&s;s mu&s;t be beholden

<P>But the&s;e Waters of <HI>Genoe,</HI> as far as I could gather by Spagyrical

of Air or of Diet, &s;ince we are nouri&s;hed by both, and can
no longer live than while we breathe and &s;uck in Air, than we can

<P>By Repletion therefore of the Brain, the Optick Nerves are debi|litated

Air: The beginning of the Nerves being filled with Humidity, not
only the forementioned Sickne&s;&s;es, but Ulcerous and Foul Sores, by
the aptne&s;s of the Air at this Juncture combining with other con|curring

them an Ear of Grain &s;piked, in that time Sown before their

<P>Here are many Tombs of their Religious Men, who are wholly

Head; a Lamp being lighted, they lay Bread and a Jarr of Water by
him, and give him a Staff in his Hand with &s;ome <HI>Deneiros</HI> for his
Journy; then they cover the Hole with Molds, and build a Turbi|nated
Tomb, without any Hollow more than for a burning Lamp.</P>

<P>From all which therefore to come home to what concerns us,

that Phlegm; by which means we are followed by pertinacious
and continued Fevers, as well as tho&s;e that accompany Catarrhs,
from the Intemperament of the Spirable Parts, whereby the Hu|mour
expre&s;&s;ed from the Brain, di&s;tills upon the Lungs, by tran&s;lati|on
of Evacuation from the Habit of the Body, where it was wont

relates only to us; for the Natives make light of &s;uch things as we
call Colds, though they are affected with them this Sea&s;on, but not
to &s;o high a degree as we; for they eat and drink rather the more for
them, and &s;light them at this time of the Year, but towards the
Winter Quarter they are more cautious. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was al|ways
my Opinion, Colds were not hurtful, &s;o long as they keep
within the Bounds of a &s;imple Cold, but rather a means to rack off
the Impurities from the Blood, as the Fermentation of Wines is of
the like Advantage to them; but when in&s;tead of clarifying it con|founds

<P>TWO days after our Arrival at <HI>Gombroon,</HI> I went to <HI>Congo,</HI> lea|ving

<P>The Pearl is a Jewel &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Geniture of a Shell-fi&s;h cal|led
<HI>Margaritifer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pearl.</NOTE> congealed into a very fair, tran&s;parent, Diaphanous,

among Authors, as betwixt <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>An&s;elmus Boetius,</HI> and between
them and <HI>Cardanus: Pliny</HI> &s;aith that they are conceived in Oy&s;ters,
by a certain Maritime Dew, which the&s;e Fi&s;h (and &s;o likewi&s;e Scol|lops)
do at a Set Time of the Year mo&s;t thir&s;t after; and according
as the Heavens are more Cloudy or Clear in the time of the taking
<PB N="321" REF="180">
in of this Dew, &s;o they are generated more Fair, or Ob&s;cure; as may
be &s;een in his Book, where he &s;peaks of tho&s;e Pearls called <HI>&V;nions,</HI>
and of the Shell-fi&s;h in which they are found, <HI>lib. 9. c.</HI> 28. But this
Opinion of <HI>Pliny</HI> concerning their Conception, is not, by <HI>An&s;elmus
Boetius,</HI> thought con&s;entaneous to Truth: For, &s;aith he, I have ta|ken
out of the&s;e Shell-fi&s;h many <HI>Margarites,</HI> and they are generated
in the Body of the Creature, of the &s;ame Humour of which the
Shell is formed; which Vi&s;cous Humour is expelled &s;ometimes (not
always) for the Fabrick of another Shell; for whenever this little
Creature is ill, and hath not &s;trength enough to belch up or expel
this Humour which &s;ticketh in the Body, it becometh the Rudi|ments
or beginning of the Pearls; to which, new Humour being ad|ded
and a&s;&s;imulated into the &s;ame Nature, by concreting and con|gealing
begets a new Skin or Film for the former Rudiments; the
continual Addition of which Humour generates an <HI>&V;nion,</HI> or Pearl;
even as Stones are generated in the Gall or Bladder of a Man; and
after the &s;ame manner the <HI>Bezoar</HI> is generated in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Goat.
<HI>Cardanus, lib. 7. de Lapidibus,</HI> &s;aith, It is a Fabulous thing that the
Pearl &s;hould be generated by the Dew of Heaven, &s;eeing the Shell|fi&s;hes
in which they are conceived have their Re&s;idence in the very
bottom of the Deep. That which is reported of them, That they
are &s;oft in the Water, and grow hard, like Coral, as &s;oon as they are
taken out, is not true, &s;aith <HI>Boetius, p.</HI> 84. For the fir&s;t, not only
common Fame, but common Experience avouches; for the latter, I
know not why it may not be as probable, as for an Egg newly laid, to
have the Shell harden'd as &s;oon as dropped into the Air, when before
in the <HI>Ovarium</HI> it participated of a Slippery, Tough, Glewy Sub|&s;tance;
not otherwi&s;e to be &s;uppo&s;ed to come forth, than by endan|gering

<P><HI>&V;nions</HI> are &s;o much the more e&s;teemed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Adultera|tion.</NOTE> becau&s;e they cannot ea&s;ily
be adulterated. There are fictitious Jewels made of double Gla&s;s,
which being &s;et in Gold, Jewellers cannot di&s;cern from Pearl, except
they take them out: Some will adulterate them with the Powder of
the Shell of the <HI>Margarite,</HI> and others with Chalk covered with
Leafs of Silver, and then anointed with the White of an Egg. Some
adulterate them with the Powder of Pearl mix'd with the White of

diver&s;ified in re&s;pect of the Place, Time, and Per&s;ons; for the Forms
of tho&s;e of the Citizens, Nobles, and Pea&s;ants, are not all alike: As
tho&s;e in Sandy and Hot Places are of one Shape, and tho&s;e in Rocky,
Stony, and Cold Parts of another: So likewi&s;e the Anniver&s;ary Mu|tations
in any of the&s;e, make them fit their Habitations for tho&s;e
Quarters.</P>
<P>The Palaces of the Potentates are built mo&s;tly after this manner:
Towards the Street appears little or no Fronti&s;piece, more than the
Porch, which makes a &s;quare &s;tately Building, arched at top, under
which is a &s;tately Balcony, open on every &s;ide, over the Ha&s;tle,
which compa&s;&s;es neat Apartments, and are defended from the Sun's
Heat by large Umbrelloes or Penthou&s;es, &s;tretching them&s;elves wide
to draw in the cool Air, the embowed parts whereof are fretted, and
the out-parts &s;hine with Blue inlaid with Gold: The Ca&s;ements, or
Folding-doors rather, &s;parkle with Glorious Panes of Gla&s;s of &s;everal
Colours, and declare the Workman&s;hip of the Carvers; as does the
out&s;ide Slates the Skill of the Tilers in Glazing and Painting, as
well as the Marble Facing the Ingenious De&s;ign of the Surveyor.</P>
<P>From the Portal runs on each hand round the Garden a Mud-Wall
very high, though not very thick, which another Wall thwarts ju&s;t
in the middle, from the Porch to the main Building, thereby to part
the Mens Quarters from the Womens; the latter whereof enclo&s;es
the Kitchen-Garden; the other is de&s;tined for Fragrant Plants, Aro|matick
Flowers, and out&s;tretching Trees for Plea&s;ure, as well as
bearing Fruit for U&s;e. The Hou&s;es are &s;o contrived, that in the
Summer they are open Banqueting-Hou&s;es, refre&s;hed with Fountains
as they &s;it in <HI>Fri&s;co,</HI> which de&s;cend thence to all the Quadrangles
by Water-Cour&s;es. Since the greate&s;t part of this Empire is not far
off the <HI>Northern</HI> Tropick, it is therefore no wonder it &s;hould com|plain
of Heat, e&s;pecially in the Summer, at which Sea&s;on the Sun
&s;trikes the Earth more directly with its Rays; for which cau&s;e,
among&s;t all of them, Aquaducts and Fountains in the very Rooms
below Stairs, are mightily prized, with Water-works playing to cool
the burning Particles of the incen&s;ed Air; and the whole Structure
is con&s;tituted &s;o, that it may receive the&s;e Refre&s;hments every way it
is capable: Wherefore they defend their Dwellings from the Sun,
and are con&s;tantly &s;prinkling Water around their Seats from the&s;e
Currents; and from their Tops have many Breathing-places to re|ceive
the Wind, which are &s;o fixed, that whatever Breezes &s;tir, they
&s;hall &s;uck them in, and tran&s;mit them to all the Rooms of the
Hou&s;e, as they li&s;t.</P>
<P>In Winter, if they be remote from the Sea, they &s;hut up their
open Halls and Parlours, and make them clo&s;e Apartments, by let|ting-down
tho&s;e Umbrelloes that &s;haded them in Summer, to keep
them warm in the cold Winter, till its Severity be pa&s;t, &s;preading all
the Floor with Quilts thick and warm, and kindling Stoves in all
their Bedchambers: The&s;e al&s;o are of a different Model from tho&s;e
nearer the Sea, They being mo&s;tly flat, The&s;e arched: Their Roofs
<PB N="336" REF="188">
are made of Wood fetch'd from <HI>India,</HI> with tran&s;ver&s;e Beams upon
Clay walls, or Stone with untempered Mortar, till they come to
the ju&s;t Altitude of their Hou&s;es, when the <HI>Inter&s;titia</HI> or Spaces be|tween
Beam and Beam are filled with Palm-Leafs neatly laid and
painted, which &s;erve for Cieling.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally common to Spherical, Arched, or Plain Buildings, to
lay va&s;t Loads of Mud at top; and what is more wonderful, only with
Mud and Clay, they will rear mo&s;t &s;pacious Arches, without other
matter of A&s;&s;i&s;tance; whereupon either again&s;t Snows or Rains,
&s;hould they continue (which they never do long) they would make
but faint Re&s;i&s;tance; for being &s;oaked thoroughly, they would re|&s;olve
into their fir&s;t Entity: Whence in great Snows, to defend and
keep their Dwellings &s;tanding, they &s;hovel it all from the Tops of
their Hou&s;es into the Lanes, and thereby ob&s;truct the Pa&s;&s;ages of
their mo&s;t Publick Streets, when the Snow has not fallen above
two days, and al&s;o endanger the Foundations; which the Rich bet|ter
&s;ecure by Brick Bottoms, than the Poor, who&s;e Fabricks often

in either Extreme, where in Summer they mu&s;t u&s;e Caves, Vaults,

<P>The Air is very rare at <HI>Spahaun,</HI> and the Wind drying: The City has
no need of Walls, where &s;o many Marble Mountains &s;tand as a
<PB N="337" REF="188">
Guard, or Bulwark of Defence; it has indeed a Tower, but it is a

the <HI>Hecatompylos</HI> of <HI>Ortellius,</HI> as is related by more than one. The
Circumference of the Body of the City I gue&s;s may mea&s;ure Seven
Miles; but if the di&s;per&s;ed Gardens and Seats of the Great Men,
with the Palace Royal be brought into that Computation, we mu&s;t
allow it as many <HI>Phar&s;angs.</HI></P>
<P>The Journy to it is difficult in Bands, Troops, or Companies,
by rea&s;on of the uneven Way encompa&s;&s;ing every &s;ide for many
Miles together; therefore to attempt coming to it with an Army
or Warlike Force, mu&s;t not be a&s;cribed to Prudence of Conduct or
Valour, unle&s;s there &s;hould ari&s;e another <HI>Alexander</HI> (which mu&s;t
be imputed to his good Fortune, rather than Prowe&s;s or Virtue)
hairbrain'dly re&s;olute to undergo no Repul&s;e, tho the Exterprize &s;ur|pa&s;s
all human Probability: For it mu&s;t unavoidably fare with him
literally, as it did hyperbolically only with <HI>Xerxes</HI> his Ho&s;t, who
are reported to have been &s;o numerous as to drink whole Rivers dry
as they pa&s;&s;ed; what then would Ci&s;terns of Rain-water do, or now
and then a &s;mall Brook, to quench the Thir&s;t even of an ordinary
Detachment, not likely to put &s;o Populous a City in the lea&s;t Con|&s;ternation?
But to find Food in &s;uch Bye and De&s;olate Paths for any
con&s;iderable Force, would be pa&s;t po&s;&s;ibility, unle&s;s at the Expence
of a Miracle. By the&s;e Bars, whereby the Pa&s;&s;es are ea&s;ily &s;ecured
(an Handful of Men being able to with&s;tand an Ho&s;t) and the

could they have conquered the&s;e Ob&s;tacles, whereby they would at
the &s;ame time have carried the Empire too.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Attendance we carried up to <HI>Spahaun,</HI> was demon&s;tra|tion
enough of this Truth; for though we fared well, yet it was
tire&s;ome, and few el&s;e meet with the like Conveniences, they being
a&s;&s;ured that we would more than reward their readine&s;s to provide
for us, whereby we the better overcame tho&s;e Straits, which prepa|red
an Entrance into the large Field where this invincible City lay
open to us; deriving its Annual Nutriment from a clear River, which
it be&s;tows plentifully from its hollow Womb: But that which it
bears the Bays away for, is its being &s;eated in the very Heart of the
Empire.</P>

that while the utmo&s;t of his Dominions are &s;ea&s;onably &s;upplied with
the comfortable Warmth of his Protection, he &s;afely re&s;ides within,
invulnerable from Foreign Strokes, and reigns in this his Capital

he both makes the whole <HI>Olympus</HI> &s;hake, and pre&s;erves the Laws of
every private City as well as Country to which they belong. As all
things by a Natural Tendency move from the Circumference to the
Centre, &s;o from the Confluence of all Nations of the World hither,
it becomes the Chief Empory, as well as an Exemplar of their Go|vernment;
although it hath declined much &s;ince the <HI>Europeans</HI> have
di&s;covered the way by Sea to <HI>India:</HI> For long before that it was the
Storehou&s;e and general Market for <HI>Indian</HI> Wares as well as its own;

with that Force they did before.</P>
<P>However, as long as the bu&s;y Merchant from the uttermo&s;t Coa&s;ts,
gapes after its Commodities to advance his Pelf, and for his &s;ake the
Publick Buzzars are kept in better Repair than le&s;s-frequented Buil|dings,
it mu&s;t be allowed it is &s;o far from a Total Decay of Trade,
that few Cities in the World &s;urpa&s;s it for Wealth, and none come

<P>For the Citizens rather chu&s;e to dwell in a tottering Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citizens humbled.</NOTE> than

&s;hould &s;u&s;pect they have too much Riches, when they are &s;ure ne|ver

which Extortion is returned by the King upon their Rulers,
whereby the Emperor's Trea&s;ure grows exuberantly great: Which
is the cau&s;e the Citizens &s;o often lay up their Talents in Napkins,
&s;ince it is a Crime to expo&s;e their Wealth by &s;pecious or luxurious
Shews, according to the accu&s;tomed Pride of Wealthie&s;t Corpora|tions

<P>Whence it proceeds that only Courtiers and Soldiers in this Coun|try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courtiers and Soldiers live great.</NOTE>
who are maintained by Annual Pen&s;ions, are permitted to live
gallantly; who&s;e regard of the Publick Utility is rarely &s;o much

them&s;elves, either to adorn or benefit the Cities in which they re&s;ide:

of this Figure; they are reared of unpoli&s;hed Stones, on an
Area Three Foot high, to keep out the Hor&s;es, and leave an out|ward

which &s;upport Four bowed Roofs, &s;urrounding an Hemi&s;pherical

clo&s;e, for tho&s;e that connot endure the Air, or for their Women;
every Quarter has a wide Entrance or open Gate to add to its Airy|ne&s;s;
to which Inns are no Stables or &s;hady Places for the Bea&s;ts of
Burthen, unle&s;s there happen to be Trees, which is a great chance in

on the <HI>South</HI>-&s;ide they have appropriated a Pulpit rai&s;ed on Steps, if it
may be &s;aid to be one without any Desk or Rails, on which he &s;its,
not &s;tands, it being placed in an Oratory apart.</P>
<P>Sometimes they pa&s;s about by little Portals to the Door of the
Temple, &s;uch an O&s;tle being left open, as we &s;ee in great Gates of
Noblemens Hou&s;es, that he who is about to go in, mu&s;t fir&s;t take
heed le&s;t he break his Shins, before he &s;toop to make his Entrance:
This Place carries &s;omething &s;olemn about it; when it is &s;hut up,
the Pulpit receives a &s;mall Light through Grates in&s;tead of Windows.</P>
<P>The Colleges in <HI>Spahaun</HI> are mo&s;tly founded and endowed by
Royal Donation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colleges.</NOTE> partly by others.</P>
<P>There are Twenty or Thirty Fair Ones that have Incomes, and
many more who&s;e Mannors are devolved by a tacit Pre&s;cript into
Secular Hands. To every College there is a Pre&s;ident over the Stu|dents,
and another over the Fabrick, who lets out the Chambers,
and receives the Rents, di&s;po&s;ing them as he plea&s;es, and di&s;placing
at plea&s;ure: Every Chamber has One, Two, Three, or more Stu|dents,
where they &s;it and lye; to this the ordinary Door &s;tands for
a Window; there are no Forms or Benches, more than an old
Moth-eaten Carpet, not fit for a Gyp&s;y's Mantle, for to u&s;e, either
for Repo&s;e or other purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Number of Scholars in each depends upon the Number of
Chambers, and the Con&s;tancy of the Revenues, there being in
&s;ome not above Forty, in others from an Hundred to an Hundred
and fifty: He who is elected into the&s;e, lives &s;paringly and &s;epa|rately,
not eating in common Halls, having no more allowed than
two or three <HI>Gosbeeks</HI> a Day, which is about &s;o many <HI>Stivers</HI> or Far|things,
from the Pre&s;ident; if the&s;e are not enough, then he a&s;&s;igns
the Tran&s;cription of &s;uch and &s;uch Books to his Aid, for which
they are paid. There are al&s;o three, four, or more Servants in con|&s;tant
Salary from the College, which any Student may of Right
command to buy Fruit for their Food, and fetch them other Nece&s;|&s;aries;
who &s;ometimes, Illiterate as they are, go away with &s;ome
of the College Revenues, and are reckoned among the Students;
being fitter to &s;hooe Hor&s;es, or drive a Wain with <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s Cha|rioteer,
than to &s;hare in that Character.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Balneos</HI> or Hummums are the mo&s;t &s;umptuous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hummums, or <HI>Balneos.</HI></NOTE> which are
in all their Cities, always hot; and it is lawful for every one of both
Sexes, on &s;tated times of the Day to bath for a &s;mall Price: The
Prepo&s;itor of each Hou&s;e gives Notice to all Comers by blowing
an Horn, when the Hou&s;es are ready to attend them; of which
there are innumerable de&s;tined to the&s;e u&s;es, each &s;triving to out&s;hine
the other; in&s;omuch that no time either of Day or Night pa&s;&s;es, but
you &s;hall hear perpetual Noi&s;es of Horns to invite you to them; for
no &s;ooner is the Fire kindled under them, but they let every one
know by tho&s;e loud In&s;truments.</P>
<P>In which Places the Treatment is alike to all; for as before was
&s;aid in the Church and Inns, &s;o in the Hot-Hou&s;es all things are com|mon
to all: Wherefore if any one de&s;ire to be freed from the Vul|gar
<PB N="344" REF="192">
Rout, he mu&s;t hire an Hou&s;e for a whole Day; which may be
done, if he pay the u&s;ual Expence and Income of that Day, which
Chri&s;tians are always obliged to, where they have not <HI>Balneos</HI> of
their own to re&s;ort to; for the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> pre&s;ume too Phari&s;aically on
the&s;e Baths, judging thereby all their Offences to be wa&s;hed away;
according to that of <HI>Lactantius, Flagitiis omnibus inquinati veniunt,
&amp; &s;emet &s;acrifica&s;&s;e opinantur, &s;i cutem laverint; tanquam libidines in|tra
pectus inclu&s;as, ulla amnis abluat aut maria ulla purificent:</HI> They
come polluted with the heinou&s;e&s;t Sins, and think when they have
wa&s;hed they have attoned by a &s;ufficient Sacrifice; as if any River or
Sea could purify their Lu&s;ts included in their Hearts.</P>
<P>The&s;e Hou&s;es are beneath the Earth, only &s;ome little round Globes
embelli&s;h'd with Painted Gla&s;s peep out above the Ground to give
Light, and are well clos'd, le&s;t the ambient Air &s;hould offend by too
forcible a Ventilation through any neglected Crevi&s;e: They are built
with divers di&s;tinct Cells one from another, in which Men &s;it, are
rubbed, and clean&s;ed: Immediately within the Porch is the greate&s;t
Cell, or rather a large Room, where they d'off their Cloaths, and
being undre&s;&s;ed leave their Garments; in the middle of this Place
is a Cy&s;tern of cold Water coming into it by &s;everal Pipes: All the
other Cells are &s;o conveniently framed, that every one may breathe
a different Air as to the degrees of Heat, &s;uch as may &s;uit with the
divers Temperaments of &s;everal Bodies, &s;ince every Con&s;titution re|quires
not the &s;ame Bath: For as <HI>Galen</HI> has left it written <HI>in lib.</HI> 7.
<HI>Morb. Med.</HI> Some want an Hot, others a Tepid, and others a Cold
Bath, as Hectical Habits declare.</P>
<P>The Pavements are all Marble, on which, the more Hot Water is
thrown, the more it increa&s;es the Heat, although at the &s;ame time
the Subterranean Fire be as Hot as it can be: On the&s;e Marble Floors
they at la&s;t extend them&s;elves, when they think they have tarried in
long enough, that the Barbers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, &s;hould wind
and turn every Limb and Joint of the Body, before, behind, and on
every &s;ide, with that Dexterity and Slight, that it is admirable to
behold them perform it; whereby they leave no Mu&s;cle, Nerve, or
&s;uperficial Joint, either unmov'd, or not rubb'd: Then with a cour&s;e
Hair-cloth and Hot Water they &s;crape off all the Filth and Sweat;
and la&s;t of all by a Depilatory they take clean away all manner of
Hairs growing either in Secret Parts, or any Emunctuary to cau&s;e
either na&s;ty Smells, or trouble&s;ome cha&s;ing.</P>
<P>When they retire to put on their Cloaths, (this is to be only un|der&s;tood
of Great Men) there waits them a Collation of Fruit,
Sweetmeats, and variety of Perfumes, as Ro&s;ewater, Rackbeet, and
the like, with all befitting Attendants, be&s;ides the u&s;ual Servitors, to
admini&s;ter either Coho, Tea, Tobacco, or Brandy, if faint. When
they are dre&s;s'd, they emplai&s;ter their Feet and Hands with a Red
Pa&s;te, which wonderfully helps &s;weaty and moi&s;t Palms, as al&s;o
&s;tinking Feet.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, the Benefits coming from the u&s;e of
the&s;e are, when the Body is inflamed and dried by immoderate Heat,
it is finely refre&s;hed by &s;weet Water, and the Pores become moi&s;ten'd;

<PB N="345" REF="192">

<P>Their Coffee-hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Coffee-hou&s;es.</NOTE> where they &s;ell <HI>Coho,</HI> better than any among

tho&s;e that are covetous of News, as well as Barterers of Goods;
where not only Fame and common Rumour is promulged, but Poe|try
too, for &s;ome of that Tribe are always pre&s;ent to reher&s;e their

<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Ex Otio Negotium,</HI> That their Bu&s;ine&s;s pro|ceeds

<P>They are modell'd after the Nature of our Theatres, that every

Canes, fa&s;ten'd to Chry&s;tal Bottles, like the Recipients or Bolt-heads
of the Chymi&s;ts, with a narrow Neck, where the Bole or Head of the
Pipe is in&s;erted, a &s;horter Cane reaching to the bottom, where the
long Pipe meets it, the Ve&s;&s;el being filled with Water: After this
&s;ort they are mightily plea&s;ed; for putting fragrant and delightful
Flowers into the Water, upon every attempt to draw Tobacco, the
Water bubbles, and makes them dance in various Figures, which
both qualifies the Heat of the Smoke, and creates together a pretty
Sight.</P>
<P>At Night here are abundance of Lamps lighted, and let down
in Gla&s;&s;es from the Concave Part of the Roof, by Wires or Ropes,
hanging in a Circle.</P>
<P>The Buzzars having been mentioned before, I &s;hall only add,
That however Great all their other Buildings are, yet the&s;e carry
away the Glory from them all; as much as the Halls of the Ci|tizens
of <HI>London</HI> exceed Noblemens Hou&s;es about the City, being the
Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Joint-Stocks; and their Shews and Entertain|ments
are as Pompous as Princes, however &s;paringly they live at
their own Homes: For the&s;e being the joint Advantage both of the
Emperor and his Subjects, he encourages their forwardne&s;s in adorn|ing
the&s;e, though he &s;uppre&s;&s;es all their Extravagancy of Garb, or
Exorbitancy in Building, if it bears not with it the becoming De&s;ign
of giving him the greate&s;t Share of Honour in the Foundation.</P>
<P>Their Bridges are made either of Brick or Stone, and want neither
for Skill or Ornament in their Contrivance; and are chiefly built for
O&s;tentation, or to pre&s;erve their Memories, as their other great
Buildings are: They are of more U&s;e to join divided Rocks for Pa&s;|&s;engers,
than to lay over Rivers; the former of which are more
frequent in the Road to the Port than the other.</P>

Such is the fatal nece&s;&s;ity of Tyrants, that lea&s;t can credit tho&s;e that
are mo&s;t allied to them; which addition to their Crimes they think
is &s;omewhat extenuated by exoculating them only at this Court;
whereby they are render'd uncapable of the Throne, (being to be

Innocents, hurrying them to Execution as &s;oon as they have e&s;caped
Impri&s;onment from their Mothers Womb: On this Ba&s;is the Old
Monarchy of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> was founded, as if no other Cement could
&s;o firmly knit, as Blood.</P>
<P>And at this In&s;tant their Jealou&s;y is &s;o fervent, that they keep

an overforward Strain of Loyalty, whereby they might &s;eem obliged

however meritorious their Deeds have been; whereby they
teach their Children perfect Obedience, before they permit them to
think of Command.</P>
<P>But whether by this way it is be&s;t; to be conver&s;ant with Toothle&s;s
Old Women, Ignorant and Effeminate Eunuchs, a Tutor more ver|&s;ed

in a common Tye of Con&s;anguinity to pre&s;erve a firm Faith for the
Head of their Tribe, as well as the Common Father of the Coun|trey:
And &s;ince their Pretence reaches no higher than a Super&s;titious
Affinity, or Adoption rather, the Throne is &s;o far out of danger by
them, that they are the Chief Pillars that &s;upport it; they being
allowed to brag both of their being of the Blood of their Emperor
and their Prophet, which obliges them to a double Obedience both
of Children and Subjects.</P>
<P>The countenancing of this Sect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erected to check the <HI>Siads.</HI></NOTE> is not to be a&s;cribed to this plau|&s;ible
Argument, more than to put a Check to the growing Perver&s;e|ne&s;s
of the <HI>Siads,</HI> boa&s;ting their Original from <HI>Mahomet</HI> him&s;elf, and
to be more immediately &s;prung from his Hou&s;e and Lineage: The&s;e
are &s;o bold as to infringe the Royal Prerogatives, and to let the Em|peror
know, That whenever he girts his Sword about him, he ought
to draw it only in their Defence, and at their Commands; not de|&s;potically
to rule according to his own Dictates, but patiently &s;ub|mit
to their In&s;tructions: This Order is unea&s;y under Monarchy,
nor are they for any Government where they are not uppermo&s;t. A
Doctrine unplea&s;ant to the Ab&s;olutene&s;s of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Emperors;
and had not the Sword of the one the prevalency of the others Preach|ing,
it were no ways to be redre&s;&s;ed; for as the one keeps them in
Awe, &s;o the Reverence paid the other on account of their Religion,
makes them pre&s;ume to inveigh, and often rai&s;e Factions again&s;t their
Princes.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Fore&s;ight of their Augu&s;t Ance&s;try is commenda|ble,
in providing another Church-Militant Tribe to &s;uppre&s;s and re|claim
the In&s;olencies of the <HI>Siads;</HI> for out of re&s;pect to their own
Laws, which are &s;till unalterable, as well as to withhold their Hands
from violating what the People repute as Sacred, they rather &s;ought by
one Nail to drive out another, than openly to denounce War again&s;t
them: Wherefore when they find them&s;elves perplexed with the
&s;ame Dilemma, they &s;eek not to abrogate any former Decree of their
Emperors by a direct Contradiction, but &s;tudy to impugn it &s;ome
other ways: As for Example; In <HI>Shaw Abas</HI> the Great's time, on
the days of their Fea&s;ts and Jubilees, Gladiators were approved and
licen&s;ed; but feeling afterwards the Evils that attended that Liberty,
which was chiefly u&s;ed in their <HI>Ho&s;&s;y Go&s;&s;y,</HI> any private Grudge being
then openly revenged; it never was forbid, but it pa&s;&s;ed into an
Edict by the following King, That it &s;hould be lawful to kill any
found with Naked Swords in that Solemnity. And on the&s;e &s;ub&s;tan|tial
<PB N="358" REF="199">
grounds this new Order enjoys not only the Name of <HI>Suffees,</HI>
but the Emperor him&s;elf will be their Captain, and &s;uffers none el&s;e
to head them, and thence takes on him the &s;pecious Name and Title
of <HI>Grand Suffee;</HI> and to perpetuate their Memory, has given it in|delibly
to <HI>Spahaun,</HI> for this rea&s;on joined with the former, to be cal|led
<HI>Suffahaun.</HI></P>

Green Attire, and forbid it to any el&s;e, they wear an high Red Vel|vet
Cap, plaited at top like a Cap of Maintenance; whence on a
Wooden Cre&s;t they fix a little Bra&s;s Ball, tied on with three wreathen

who&s;e lower Brim is bound about with a White Sa&s;h, and &s;ome|times

that in <HI>Turky,</HI> if any other wear it, he pays dearly for his Folly:

<HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Banner: In oppo&s;ition to whom, the <HI>Grand Suffee</HI> erects a
double-pointed Bloody Sword in a White Field, and brings it out in
honour of <HI>Mortis Ally.</HI></P>
<P>To his adopted Kindred (now Regulars under him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Privi|leges.</NOTE> their Chief)
are many Privileges granted, and by them to be held inviolable.</P>
<P>They are allowed a peculiar <HI>Mi&s;&s;a,</HI> or Service, in a Chappel apart

of <HI>Holway,</HI> (or Wafer made up in Sweetmeats,) in Imita|tion
of the Shew-bread.</P>
<P>When any one has run into Debt, or committed any Capital Crime,
as Murther, Adultery, Theft, or the like; if the one to defraud
his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">editor, and the other to avoid the hands of Ju&s;tice, make their
E&s;cape to the <HI>Alacoppe,</HI> the fir&s;t Gate of the Palace-Royal, or to the
King's Stables, and implore their Protection, and they engage for
their Refuge, it is a Piacular Offence to force them thence; nor will
they re&s;ign them to the Emperor, though he command them to be
taken from their Sanctuary.</P>
<P>Nor are they &s;o wholly devoted to compa&s;&s;ionate others Afflicti|ons,
as to defend their own Rights; for who&s;oever's Face the Em|peror
commands them to cover, they are dead in Law; nor will
they &s;cruple being Executioners, no more than the <HI>Roman</HI> Lictors,
who bore the Rods and Axes; the latter of which are their proper
Weapons of War, as well as a fit Badge of their Office.</P>
<P>Their pre&s;cribed Number cannot enlarge its &s;elf to all of their
Sect; wherefore they are inter&s;per&s;ed among the common People,
&s;ome following Trades and Husbandry, and others other Employ|ments;
retaining always their Habit, which none of the Vulgar
dare affront or &s;trike, however provoked; but taking off their <HI>Suf|fean</HI>
Cap fir&s;t, and ki&s;&s;ing it, laying it down reverently, they will not
then be afraid to cuff them, or drub them to purpo&s;e; being careful
in the mean while to offer no Indignity to the Order, while they
revenge them&s;elves on the Per&s;ons.</P>

<P>Their Thick-&s;cull'd Prophet has &s;et another Angel at work for

Doctor to apprehend; wherein are couched Words of &s;uch efficacy,
which if they were pronounced by Unpolluted Lips, and whoever
&s;hould under&s;tand them and Pray, might both Rai&s;e the Dead and
work Miracles; and that of an unque&s;tioned truth this Book came
from God, as both the Foecundity of Stile, and admirable Eloquence
doth te&s;tify. For they are not afraid prophanely to &s;ay, That God
accommodated his Mi&s;&s;ions to Place, Age, and the exigency of
Times; in the Days of Chri&s;t there were excellent Phy&s;icians,

this Prophet exceeded the degree of meer Man.</P>
<P>When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> lived, many Magicians and Cunning Men were

A&s;trologers: The <HI>Co&s;&s;aks</HI> on the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> came thence over the
<HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and made a De&s;cent into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and carried off a great
Booty, loading their &s;mall Ships without any oppo&s;ition: The

being without doubt carefully &s;tudied, &s;hould as infallibly come to
pa&s;s to that upon their invading them, not one of them &s;hould e&s;cape:
And for the better obtaining their end, advi&s;ed'em to fa&s;ten their Ships

get out of their hands: But the cunning <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> being u&s;ed to Stra|tagems,
fore&s;eeing their De&s;ign, fell upon the fir&s;t Ship with their
Guns, which &s;o bored her Sides, that &s;he &s;unk, and by her weight
occa&s;ioned the re&s;t to &s;ink one after another, &s;o that 500 Men, and
Twelve Ships were &s;ent to the bottom in a well-cho&s;en hour, and
the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> by this Exploit left Ma&s;ters of the Sea, and the Borders
thereon liable to their continual Incur&s;ions.</P>
<P>Three Years after, one of the &s;ame Tribe contriving how to aug|ment

her Native; a pretty Wheedle to in&s;inuate into the <HI>Suffee</HI>'s favour)
<Q>if therefore any thing be asked beyond my reach, that needs an

<P>This being a new Doctrine to the <HI>Suffee,</HI> he commanded her to
give him &s;ome Demon&s;tration of the truth of what &s;he had told;
and therefore put her upon di&s;covering how he might believe the
airy Region to be peopled after this rate; &s;he con&s;ented to convince
him, and ordered all the Nobles attending the Emperor, to retire
with him into one part of the Room, and leave her to work their
Conviction, which &s;he did after this manner:</P>
<P>Falling into her u&s;ual Trance, &s;he at that in&s;tant wrought their

<P>Father <HI>Raphiel</HI> the <HI>Capuchin,</HI> who gave me this account, was &s;et

&s;paringly do they feed on Fle&s;h alone, ordered after this manner; and
if at any time they intend a Meal thereon, they have it well Boiled,
Baked, Fried, or Stewed, or made into <HI>Pullow;</HI> which is a general
Me&s;s, as frequent with them as a good &s;ub&s;tantial piece of Beef is

<P>To make <HI>Pullow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pullow.</NOTE> the Meat is fir&s;t Boiled to Rags, and the Broth or
Liquor being &s;trained, it is left to drain, while they Boil the Rice in the
&s;ame; which being tender, and the aqueous parts evaporating, the
Juice and Gravy incorporates with the Rice, which is Boiled almo&s;t
dry; then they put in the Meat again with Spice, and at la&s;t as
much Butter as is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o that it becomes not too Gree&s;y or Of|fen&s;ive,
either to the Sight or Ta&s;te; and it is then Boiled enough
when it is fit to be made into Gobbets, not &s;labby, but each Corn of
Rice is &s;welled and filled, not bur&s;t into Pulp; and then with <HI>Mango</HI>
or other <HI>Achar,</HI> they will devour whole Handfuls (for Spoons are
not in u&s;e, unle&s;s to drink <HI>Sherbet</HI> with, they mixing their Pottage

<P>Sherbets are made of almo&s;t all Tart plea&s;ing Fruits as the Juice

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t I had thought to have pre&s;ented you with my own

<P>Forty Cour&s;e <HI>Northward</HI> of <HI>Surat</HI> lies <HI>Broach;</HI> it therefore being

&s;end a Me&s;&s;enger for A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which gave me opportunity of &s;ee|ing
that City, &s;oon after I had returned with the Pre&s;ident to <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>The Way thither is twofold, either by Sea or Land; the fir&s;t,
from <HI>Swally-hole,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author &s;ent for to <HI>Broach.</HI></NOTE> makes an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age up that Creek, or rather
Arm of the Sea, to <HI>Broach</HI> River's Mouth, into which the River
empties its &s;elf: The latter is mea&s;ured over a &s;pacious Plain, and is
travelled either by Coach or on Hor&s;eback, both which I had for my
Conveyance, together with the Attendance of a good Guard of the
Company's <HI>Peons,</HI> becau&s;e of frequent Robberies hereabouts. Going
out by <HI>Broach</HI>-Gate, we fell into a notable beaten Way;
<Q>Hoc iter manife&s;ta rotae ve&s;tigia cernes.</Q>
Contrary to whatever we found in any Place of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Different Modes of tra|velling in <HI>In|dia,</HI> from that of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></NOTE>
where are neither Carts, Coaches, or Wains: There we &s;el|dom

are pe&s;ter'd with Caphalaes of Oxen, Camels, and Bufolaes, with
heavy Waggons drawn by Teams of Oxen, yok'd Eight, &s;ome|times
a Dozen or Sixteen times double, bringing and carrying Goods

or A&s;&s;aults; here they mu&s;t ob&s;erve the &s;et times, and move with a
good Force, both to defend them from their own Armies, and the
In&s;ults of Outlaws: Here are no Caravans or Inns to &s;hut them
in a-nights, for then is their time of travelling; and when they
re&s;t, if they have no Tents, they mu&s;t &s;helter them&s;elves under
&s;hady Trees, or &s;ometimes great Tombs in the Highways, unle&s;s
they happen on a <HI>Chowkre, i. e.</HI> a Shed, where the Cu&s;tomer keeps a
Watch to take Cu&s;tom: Yet good Rivers are more often found here
than there; and where they are deficient, they want not great Tanks
or Ponds of Rain-Water mo&s;tly uncover'd and open to the Heavens,
or el&s;e deep Wells many Fathom under Ground, with &s;tately Stone
Stairs, Cool Apartments, and Grottoes, whence Oxen (as has been
&s;aid) draw Water, with huge Leathern Buckets or Pots around a
Wheel, to water their Gardens: But one thing you are more &s;ure of
here than there, and that is, Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, in almo&s;t every
Village, which &s;tand thick hereabouts.</P>
<P>The Coaches (unle&s;s tho&s;e called the Pre&s;ident's) and Carts are
much alike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Chariots for travelling.</NOTE> the la&s;t being only &s;tronger built with main Timber for
&s;trength. But it being no unplea&s;ant &s;pectacle to &s;ee one of the&s;e
Chariots equipped, I cannot forbear giving it you; though I am
&s;en&s;ible it cannot be &s;o well expre&s;s'd in writing, as the Sight is now
comically repre&s;ented unto me: Two large Milk-white Oxen are
putting in to draw it, with circling Horns as black as a Coal, each
Point tipped with Bra&s;s, from whence come Bra&s;s Chains acro&s;s to
the Head&s;tall, which is all of Scarlet, and a Scarlet Collar to each,
of Bra&s;s Bells, about their Necks, their flapping Ears &s;nipped with
Art, and from their No&s;trils Bridles covered with Scarlet: The Cha|riot
it &s;elf is not &s;winging like ours, but fa&s;ten'd to the main Axle
by neat Arches, which &s;upport a Four&s;quare Seat, which is inlaid
with Ivory, or enriched as they plea&s;e; at every Corner are turn'd
Pillars, which make (by twi&s;ted Silk or Cotton Cords) the Sides,
and &s;upport the Roof, covered with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Scarlet Cloth, and lin'd
with Silk, with Party-colour'd Borders; in the&s;e they &s;pread Car|pets,
and lay Bol&s;ters to ride cro&s;s-legg'd, &s;ometimes three or four
in one: It is born on two Wheels only, &s;uch little ones as our Fore|wheels
are, and pinn'd on with a Wooden Arch, which &s;erves to
mount them: The Charioteer rides afore, a-&s;traddle on the Beam
that makes the Yoke for the Oxen, which is covered with Scarlet,
and finely carved underneath; he carries a Goad in&s;tead of a Whip:
In Winter (when they rarely &s;tir) they have a <HI>Mumjuma,</HI> or Wax-Cloth
to throw over it. Tho&s;e for Journeying are &s;omething &s;trong|er
than tho&s;e for the Merchants to ride about the City, or to take
the Air on; which with their nimble Oxen they will, when they
meet in the Fields, run Races on, and contend for the Garland as
much as for an Olympick Prize; which is a Diver&s;ion, <HI>To &s;ee a Cow
gallop,</HI> as we &s;ay in &s;corn; but the&s;e not only pluck up their Heels
apace, but are taught to amble, they often riding on them.</P>
<P>Four-wheel'd Coaches, and to &s;it with the Legs hanging down,
here are none, unle&s;s &s;ome few the <HI>Europe</HI> Merchants have, covered
with Scarlet, and ill hung, being much like tho&s;e &s;old at <HI>London</HI> to

having no Hor&s;es managed for the Coach, or any skill'd to drive
them, &s;o that the&s;e al&s;o are drawn by Oxen.</P>
<P>Setting out about Sun ri&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bereaw.</NOTE> we pa&s;&s;ed by plea&s;ant Inclo&s;ures &s;pread
far from the City, and flouri&s;hing Fields of Corn, and Plantations of

<HI>Bereaw,</HI> a Village on the Bank of the other &s;ide; and at <HI>Per&s;aw,</HI> two
Cour&s;e more, we broke our Fa&s;t; when it growing hot, we went
but a Cour&s;e and a half over another &s;mall River, before we baited
under a Grove of Palms, or Toddy-Trees.</P>

where Cu&s;tom is exacted, a Bar of Thorns being &s;tuck into an

Here we &s;lept at our Broker's Hou&s;e, and at Sun-ri&s;e proceeded over

<Q><HI>Sahab, (i. e.</HI>) Sir, why will you do more than the Creator ever
meant? You &s;ee hardly two Faces bear exactly the &s;ame Features:
Look farther into the World, and behold the variety of Creatures!
God has made Elephants, Tygres, Hor&s;es, Camels, Sheep, and Oxen,
of different Figures, and Man of a more exalted Compo&s;ure than
the re&s;t; whereas had the All-wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of Things thought it
convenient, he might have re&s;ted contented in one only Form;
but every one of the&s;e in their &s;everal Species glorifies their Maker:
And &s;o it has plea&s;ed God to permit Variety of Religions, by which
Men wor&s;hip and call upon him; nor can they go on in any one
again&s;t his Will, to which whatever is contrary cannot continue;
and till he make Men to be of one mind, in vain does any go about
to compel what he has ingrafted in their hearts.</Q> This rational
Di&s;cour&s;e kept the <HI>Brachmin</HI> in his Office, but could not quite extin|gui&s;h
his conceived Prejudice again&s;t their Super&s;titions.</P>
<P>Which he made appear, by giving Order to demoli&s;h all the Tem|ples,

by Site invincible, had not the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Commanders Treachery
gained on the Faith of an ea&s;y Woman; who relying on their Me|diation,
neglected the Means of her own Security, there being nei|ther
Men nor Ammunition to oppo&s;e his Entry; whereupon they
left all open, and retreated in di&s;order from the approaching Foe, to
Places better provided, and inacce&s;&s;ible to any but tho&s;e who are
acquainted with the Rece&s;&s;es: Sullying hereby the brave Provoca|tion
that drew on her the Emperor's Arms; which &s;he might have
prevented at fir&s;t by a mean Compliance, or more nobly now by a
&s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance; rather than by a ba&s;e Flight yield to the Will of a

Shore at <HI>Folk&s;tone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Five Miles South of <HI>Dover,</HI> on the
Twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1682.</P>
<P>From whence &s;ending you this, give me leave to come lei&s;urely
to <HI>London,</HI> that in that time I may feel my Legs, and try how
agreeable the natural Sweets of <HI>England</HI> by degrees may be to one
who in this long Ab&s;ence has &s;o little felt the Hard&s;hips of Travel,
e&s;pecially coming home; which though a tedious Voyage of Seven
Months, we pa&s;&s;ed away merrily with good Wine, and no bad
Mu&s;ick; but the Life of all, good Company and an hone&s;t Com|mander;
who fed us with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions of Turkies, Gee&s;e,
Ducks, Hens, &s;ucking Pigs, Sheep, Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to Crown all,
the Day we made <HI>England,</HI> kill'd us a fatted Calf; &s;o that you
may &s;pare that Welcome when you receive,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours,
J. F.</SIGNED>
Soli DEO Gloria. Amen.</CLOSER>
