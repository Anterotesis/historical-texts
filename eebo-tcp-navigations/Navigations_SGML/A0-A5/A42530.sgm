<HEAD><HI>Strange News from</HI> Plymouth: <HI>Or, a Wonderful and Tragical Relation of a Voyage from the</HI> Indies, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to promi&s;e in my la&s;t, I have inquired into the particulars of that &s;o Tragical Relation therein mentioned, the which (without any Prologue) I &s;hall lay down in its Naked Truth, as I had the &s;ame from the mouth of the Survivours who are now at my Hou&s;e, which if you plea&s;e take as follows&mdash; A Gentleman called the <HI>Heer van E&s;&s;ell</HI> Native of the Low-Countries, having had the Edu|cation of a Merchant at home, was re&s;olved to improve his Pacri|mony in &s;ome Forreign Parts: To which end, being thereunto the more Encouraged by the promi&s;e of a &s;trict Corre&s;pondence with &s;everal of his Countrymen, he undertook a Voyage to the <HI>Indies,</HI> whither he Arrived about the year 1670. And by the Indu&s;trious Management of his Affairs, increa&s;ed his E&s;tate &s;o con|&s;iderably, that few Men in tho&s;e parts Lived in greater &s;plendor, being thus &s;etled about 7 years, afterwards he came acquain|ted with the Daughter of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of great Fortune, a Gentlewoman of many worthy Accompli&s;hments, and exceed|ing Beautiful, our Merchant being much taken with her Port and Beauty, made his Addre&s;&s;es to her, and re&s;olving to change his Condition, found her not altogether aver&s;e to his Happine&s;s, which by degrees he rai&s;ed to Con&s;ent, and obtain'd Her for his Wife, with whom he lived very happily for &s;everal years, till he had increa&s;ed his E&s;tate to &s;uch a Portion as made him think to return to his own Country where he fir&s;t drew Breath, and had left his Relations, Communicating which De&s;ign to his Lady, &s;he readily a&s;&s;ented to the Voyage, and accordingly he made preparation to gather his E&s;tate into a Bottom, and take leave of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which in a &s;hort time he Effected, and being &s;upplied
<PB N="4" REF="3">with a Ve&s;&s;el that had di&s;charged her &s;elf at the &s;aid Port; he hired the &s;ame for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and therein Imbarked him&s;elfe, his Wife, two Children, and one Servant, with all his E&s;tate, which amounted to a very con&s;iderable Catgoe, and in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t took Shipping. The flattering Sea which too often beguiles us to our undoing, promi&s;ed him for the two fir&s;t months a very hap|py Voyage, and fill'd his Heart with hopes of touching the Shore, the long ab&s;ence of his Friends rendred very de&s;irable to him, and Boy'd up with the exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ctation of a happine&s;s cruel Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> had de&s;ign'd to deprive him off, was on a &s;udden becalm'd, in&s;omuch that for &s;everal weeks they could &s;car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e tell whether they were forwarded a Leagues &s;pace, in which time the &s;ixteen Seamen and Ma&s;ter that was one Board, by a Di&s;ea&s;e that increa&s;ed among&s;t them, &s;everal Dyed, and by Degrees their Provi&s;ion growing &s;hort, they were forced to deal the &s;ame more &s;paringly about, hoping by their care they might have enough to &s;erve then thro their Voyage, and made the be&s;t way they could to their de&s;ired Port; yet &s;uch was their misfortune, that they were failed of their expectation, and came to &s;ee the la&s;t of what they had &s;pent, and for four days lived without any &s;u&s;tenance, and the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d be|ing Cro&s;s they could not make Land, where they might re|victual, but were forced to keep on their Voyage.
