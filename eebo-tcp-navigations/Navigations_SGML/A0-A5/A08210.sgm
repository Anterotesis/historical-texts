<P>_AS there is a generall vengeance, which &s;ecretly pur&s;ueth the doers of wrong, and &s;uffereth them not to pro&s;per, albeit no man of purpo&s;e empeach them: &s;o is there a particular indigna|tion, engraffed in the bo&s;ome of all that are wronged, which cea&s;eth not &s;eeking by all meanes po&s;&s;ible to redre&s;&s;e or remedy the wrong receiued.

times finde meanes whereby though the Eagle lay her egges in Iupiters lappe, yet by one way or other, &s;hee e&s;capeth not requitall of her wrong done the Emmet.</P>
<P>Among the manifold examples hereof, which for|mer ages haue committed to memory, or our time yeelded to &s;ight: I &s;uppo&s;e, there hath not beene any, more notable then this in hand: either in re&s;pect of the greatne&s;&s;e of the per&s;on, by whom the fir&s;t injury was offered; or the meanne&s;&s;e of him, who righteth him&s;elf: the one being (in his owne conceit) the mightie&s;t Mo|narch of all the world: the other an Engli&s;h Captaine, a meane &s;ubiect of her Maie&s;ties.

<P>The winde continued pro&s;perous and fauorable at Northea&s;t, and gaue as a very good pa&s;&s;age, without any alteration or change:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune 3.</NOTE> &s;o that albeit we had &s;ight of <HI>Porto Sa to,</HI> one of the <HI>Maderas,</HI> and of the <HI>Canaries</HI> al&s;o within twelue dayes of our &s;etting forth: yet we neuer &s;trooke &s;ayle, nor came to anchor, nor made any &s;tay for any cau&s;e, neither there nor el&s;ewhere, vntill 25.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune 28.</NOTE> dayes after; when we had &s;ight of the Iland of <HI>Guada|lupe,</HI> one of the Ilands of the We&s;t Indies, goodly high land.</P>
<P>The next morning we entred between <HI>Dominica</HI> &amp; <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> where we de&s;cryed two Canoas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune 29,</NOTE> comming from a rocky Iland, three leagues off <HI>Dominica,</HI> which
<PB N="4" REF="7">
v&s;ually repayre thither to fi&s;h, by rea&s;on of the great plenry thereof, which is there continually to be found. Wee landed on the South &s;ide of it, remaining there three dayes to refre&s;h our men, and water our &s;hips, out of one of tho&s;e goodly riuers, which fall downe off the mountaine. There we &s;awe certaine poore cot|tages, built with Palmito boughs and branches, but no inhabitants at that time ciuill nor &s;auage; the cot|tages it may be, (for we could know no certaine cau&s;e of the &s;olitarine&s;&s;e we found there) &s;eruing, not for con|tinuall inhabitation, but only for their v&s;es that came to that place at certaine &s;ea&s;ons to fi&s;h.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuly 1.</NOTE>The third day after about, three in the after-noone, wee &s;et &s;ayle from thence, towards the continent of <HI>Terra firma.</HI> And the fift day after, wee had &s;ight of the high land of <HI>Santa Martha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuly 6.</NOTE> but came not neere the &s;hoare by ten leagues. But thence directed our cour&s;e, for a place called by vs <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> for that our Cap|taine had &s;o named it in his former voyage, by rea&s;on of the great &s;tore of tho&s;e goodly Fowles, which he and his Company did then daily kill, and feed on, in that place. In this cour&s;e, notwith&s;tanding wee had two dayes calme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuly. 12.</NOTE> yet within &s;ix dayes after we arriued at our <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> which is a fine round Bay, of very &s;afe harbor for all winds, lying betweene two high points, not pa&s;t halfe a cables length ouer at the mouth, but within, eight or tenne cables length euery way, hauing ten or twelue faddome water more or le&s;&s;e, full of good fi&s;h, the &s;oyle al&s;o very fruitfull; which may appeare by this, that our Captaine hauing beene in this place, within a yeare and fewe dayes before, and hauing ridde the place with many alleys and paths made, yet now all was &s;o ouer-grown againe, as that we
<PB N="5" REF="7">
doubted at fir&s;t, whither this were the &s;ame place or no.</P>
<P>At our entrance into this Bay, our Captaine ha|uing giuen order to his brother what to doe, if any occa&s;ion &s;hould happen in his ab&s;ence, was on his way, with intent to haue gone aland, with &s;ome fewe only in his company, becau&s;e he knew, there dwelt no Spa|niards within thirty fiue leagues of that place. <HI>Tolou</HI> be|ing the neere&s;t to the Ea&s;twards, and <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to the we&s;twards, where any of that Nation dwelt. But as we were rowing a &s;hoare, we &s;aw a &s;moake in the woods, euen neere the place, which our Captaine had afore|time frequented: therefore thinking it fit to take more &s;trength with vs, he cau&s;ed his other boat al&s;o to be mand, with certaine muskets, and other weapons, &s;u&s;|pecting &s;ome enemy had beene a &s;hoare.</P>
<P>When we landed, we found by euident markes, that there had beene lately there, a certaine Engli&s;h man of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> called <HI>Iohn Garret,</HI> who had beene condu|cted thither by certaine Engli&s;h Mariners, which had beene there with our Captaine in &s;ome of his former voyages. He had now left a plate of Lead, nailed fa&s;t to a mighty great tree (greater then any foure men, joy|ning hands, could fathome about; on which were en|grauen the&s;e words, directed to our Captaine.</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="8">The &s;moake which wee &s;awe, was occationed by a fire, which the &s;aid <HI>Garret</HI> and his Company, had made before their departure, in a very great tree (not farre from this which had the lead nayled on it) which had continued burning at lea&s;t fiue dayes before our arriuall.</P>
<P>This aduerti&s;ement notwith&s;tanding, our Captaine meant not to depart, before he had built his Pinna&s;es, which were yet aboard in peices, for which purpo&s;e hee knew this Port, a mo&s;t conuenient place. And therfore a&s;&s;oone as we had moared our Ships, our Cap|taine commanded his Pinna&s;es to be brought a&s;hore, for the Carpenters to &s;et vp, him&s;elfe employing all his other company in fortifying a place, which he had cho&s;en out, as a mo&s;t fit plot, of three quarters of an acre of ground, to make &s;ome &s;trength or &s;afety for the pre&s;ent, as &s;ufficiently as the meanes he had would afford, which was performed, by felling of great trees, and bow&s;ing and haling them together with great Pulleis and hal&s;ers, vntill they were inclo&s;ed to the water, and then letting others fall vpon them, vntill they had rai&s;ed with trees and boughes thirty foot in height round about, leauing onely one gate to i&s;&s;ue at, neere the waters &s;ide, which euery night (that wee might &s;leepe in more &s;afety and &s;ecurity) was &s;hut vp, with a great tree drawne athwart it. The whole plott was built in a Pentagonall forme, to wit, of fiue equall &s;ides and angles, of which angles two were toward the &s;ea, and that &s;ide between them was left open, for the ea&s;ie launching of our Pinna|&s;es: the other foure equall &s;ides were wholely (ex|cepting the gate before mentioned) firmely clo&s;ed vp.

One of them &s;pe|cially was marked to haue had &s;eauen of tho&s;e &s;taies or buttre&s;&s;es, for the &s;upporting of his greatnes and height, which being mea&s;ured with a line clo&s;e by the barke and neere to the ground, as it was indented or extant, was found to be aboue thirty nine yards about.

<P>To this end, di&s;po&s;ing of all his companies, accor|ding as they inclined mo&s;t, hee left the three Ships and the Caruell with Captaine <HI>Rau&s;e,</HI> and cho&s;e into his foure Pinnaces (Captaine <HI>Rau&s;es</HI> Shallop made the fourth) be&s;ides fifty three of our men, twenty more of Captaine <HI>Rau&s;es</HI> company, with which hee &s;eemed competently furni&s;hed, to atcheiue what hee intended: e&s;pecially hauing proportioned, according to his owne purpo&s;e, and our mens di&s;po&s;ition, their &s;eue|rall armes&punc; <HI>viz</HI> &s;ix Targets, &s;ix Firepikes, twelue Pikes, twenty foure Muskets and Calliuers, &s;ixteene Bowes, and &s;ix Partizans, two Drums, and two Trompets.</P>
<P>Thus hauing parted from our company:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuly 28.</NOTE> wee arri|ued at the Iland of <HI>Catinaas,</HI> being twenty fiue leagues di&s;tant; about fiue dayes after, there wee landed all in the morning betimes: and our Captaine trained his men, deliuering them their &s;euerall weapons and armes, which hitherto hee had kept very faire and &s;afe in good caske: and exhorting them after his man|ner, hee declared the greatnes of the hope of good things that was there: the weaknes of the towne be|ing vnwalled, and the hope hee had of preuailing to recompence his wrongs, e&s;pecially now that hee &s;hould come with &s;uch a crew, who were like minded with him&s;elfe; and at &s;uch a time, as hee &s;hould bee vtterly vndi&s;couered.</P>

wee were as farre as <HI>Rio Franci&s;co</HI>: thence hee led vs hard aboard the &s;hore (that wee might not bee de&s;cried of the watch hou&s;e) vntill that being come within two leagues of the point of the Bay, hee cau&s;ed vs to &s;trike a hull, and ca&s;t our grappers, riding &s;o vntill it was darke night.</P>
<P>Then wee waighed againe and &s;et &s;ayle, rowing hard aboard the &s;hore, with a&s;much &s;ilence as wee could, till wee recouered the point of the harbor vn|der the high land: there wee &s;tayed all &s;ilent, purpo|&s;ing to attempt the towne in the dawning of the day, after that wee had repo&s;ed our &s;elues for a while.</P>
<P>But our Captaine with &s;ome others of his be&s;t men, finding that our people were talking of the greatnes of the towne, and what their &s;trength might bee, e&s;|pecially by the report of the Negroes that wee tooke at the Ile of <HI>Pinos</HI>: thought it be&s;t to put the&s;e con|ceits out of their heads, and therefore to take the op|portunity of the ri&s;ing of the moone that night, per|&s;uading them that it was the day dawning. By this oc|ca&s;ion we were at the towne, a large hower &s;ooner then fir&s;t was purpo&s;ed. For wee arriued there by three of the clock after midnight: at what time it fortuned that a Ship of <HI>Spaine,</HI> of &s;ixtie Tunnes, laden with Ca|nary wines and other commodities, which had but lately come into the Bay, and had not yet furld her &s;prit-&s;aile, e&s;pying our foure Pinnaces, being an extraordinary number, and tho&s;e rowing with ma|ny Oares, &s;ent away her Gundeloe towards the towne, to giue warning: but our Captaine percei|uing it, cut betwixt her and the towne, forcing her to goe to th'other &s;ide of the Bay: whereby wee landed without impeachment, although wee found

one gunner vpon the platforme, in the very place where wee landed, being a &s;andy pray and no key at all, not pa&s;t twenty yards from the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>There wee found &s;ix great Peeces of bra&s;&s;e Ordi|nance, mounted vpon their cariages, &s;ome Demy, &s;ome whole Culuering: wee pre&s;ently di&s;mounted them, the gunner fled, the towne tooke alarme (being ve|ry ready thereto, by rea&s;on of their often di&s;quieting, by their neere neighbours the <HI>Symerons</HI>) as wee per|ceiued, not onely by the noy&s;e and cries of the peo|ple, but by the bell ringing out, and drums running vp and downe the towne.</P>
<P>Our Captaine according to the directions which hee had giuen ouer night, to &s;uch as hee had made choice of for the purpo&s;e, left twelue to keepe the Pinna&s;es, that wee might be &s;ure of a &s;afe retreat, if the wor&s;t befell. And hauing made &s;ure worke of the platforme before hee would enter the towne, hee thought be&s;t, fir&s;t to view the mount, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the towne, where hee was informed, by &s;un|dry intelligences the yeare before, they had an intent to plant Ordinance, which might &s;coure round about the towne. Therefore leauing one halfe of his com|pany, to make a &s;tand at the foote of the mount, hee marched vp pre&s;ently vnto the top of it, with all &s;peed to try the truth of the report for the more &s;afety. There wee found no peice of Ordinance, but onely a very fit place prepared for &s;uch v&s;e, and therefore wee left it without any of our men, and with all celerity re|turned downe the mount, Then our Captaine appoin|ted his brother, with <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> and &s;ixteene other of his men, to goe about, behinde the Kings trea&s;ure-hou&s;e, and enter neere the Ea&s;ter end of the market-place:

<P>The Firepikes diuided halfe to the one, and halfe to th'other company, &s;erued no le&s;&s;e for fright to the enemy, then light of our men, who by this meanes might di&s;cerne euery place very well, as if it were neere day, whereas the inhabitants &s;tood amazed at &s;o &s;trange a fight, maruelling what the matter might bee, and imagining, by rea&s;on of our drums and trompets &s;ounding in &s;o &s;undry places, that wee had beene a farre greater number then wee were.</P>
<P>Yet by meanes of the &s;oldiers, which were in the towne, and by rea&s;on of the time which wee &s;pent in marching vp and downe the mount, the &s;oldiers and the inhabitants had put them&s;elues in armes, and brought their companies in &s;ome order, at the &s;outh ea&s;t end of the market place, neere the gouernors hou&s;e, and not farre from the gate of the towne, which is only one, leading towards <HI>Panama,</HI> hauing (as it &s;eemes) gathered them&s;elues thither, either that in the gouernors &s;ight they might &s;hew their valor, if it might preuaile, or el&s;e that by the gate, they might be&s;t take their <HI>vale,</HI> and e&s;cape redie&s;t.</P>
<P>And to make a &s;hew of farre greater numbers of &s;hot, or el&s;e of a cu&s;tome they had, by the like de|vice to terrify the <HI>Symerons,</HI> they had hung lines with matches lighted, ouerthwart the we&s;ter-end of the mar|ket-place, betwene the church and the cro&s;&s;e, as though there had beene in a readines &s;ome company of &s;hott, whereas indeed there was not pa&s;t two or three that taught the&s;e lines to dance, till they them|&s;elues ranne away, a&s;&s;oone as they perceiued they

<P>But the Souldiers and &s;uch as were joyned with them, pre&s;ented vs with a jolly hotte volue of &s;hot, beating full vpon the egre&s;&s;e of that &s;treete, in which we marched, and leuelling very lowe, &s;o as their bullers oft times grazed on the &s;and. We &s;tood not to an&s;wer them in like tearmes; but hauing di&s;charged our fir&s;t volly of &s;hot, and feathered them with our arrowes (which our Captaine had cau&s;ed to be made of pur|po&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> not great &s;heafe arrowes, but fine ro|uing &s;hafts; very carefully re&s;erued for the &s;eruice) wee came to the pu&s;h of pike, &s;o that our fire-pikes be|ing well armed and made of purpo&s;e, did vs very great &s;eruice. For our men with their pikes and &s;hort weapons, in &s;hort time tooke &s;uch order among the&s;e gallants, &s;ome v&s;ing the but-end of their peeces in &s;tead of other weapons, that partly by rea&s;on of our arrowes, which did vs there notable &s;eruice, partly by occa&s;ion of this &s;trange and &s;uddaine clo&s;ing with them, in this manner vnlooked for, and the rather for that at the very in&s;tant, our Captaines brother, with the other Company, with their fire-pikes, entred the market place by th'ea&s;ter &s;treet: they ca&s;ting downe their weapons, fled all out of the Towne by the gate afore&s;aid, which had beene built for a barre to keepe out of the Towne the <HI>Symerons,</HI> who had often a&s;&s;ai|led it, but now &s;erued for a gap for the Spaniards to fly at.</P>
<P>In following and returning, diuers of our men were hurt, with the weapons which the enemy had let fall as he fled: &s;omewhat, for that wee marched with &s;uch &s;peed, but more for that they lay &s;o thicke and cro&s;&s;e on the other.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12">Being returned, we made our &s;tand neere the mid&s;t of the market place, where a tree groweth hard by the Cro&s;&s;e; whence our Captaine &s;ent of our men to &s;tay the ringing of the alarme Bell, which had continued all this while: but the Church being very &s;trongly built and fa&s;t &s;hut, they could not without firing (which our Captaine forbad) get into the &s;teeple where the Bell hung.</P>
<P>In the meane time, our Captaine hauing taken two or three Spaniards in their flight, commanded them to &s;hew him the Gouernours hou&s;e, where hee vnder|&s;tood was the ordinary place of vnlading the Moyles, of all the trea&s;ure which came from <HI>Panamah</HI> by the Kings appointment: Although the &s;iluer only was kept there: the gold, pearle and jewels (being there once entred by the Kings Officer) was caried from thence to the Kings trea&s;ure-hou&s;e not farre off, being a hou&s;e very &s;trongly built of lime and &s;tone, for the &s;afe kee|ping thereof.</P>
<P>At our comming to the Gouernours hou&s;e, wee found the great dore (where the Moyles doe v&s;ually vnlade) euen then opened a Candle, lighted vpon the top of the &s;taires; and a faire Gennet ready &s;adled, ei|ther for the Gouernour him&s;elfe, or &s;ome other of his hou&s;ehold to carry it after him. By meanes of this light, we &s;aw a huge heape of &s;iluer, in that nether roome: being a pile of barres of &s;iluer, of (as neareas we could gue&s;&s;e) &s;eauenty foote in length, of ten foot in breadth, &amp; twelue foote in height, piled vp again&s;t the wall, each barre was betweene thirty fiue and forty pound in weight. At &s;ight hereof our Captaine commanded &s;traightly that none of vs &s;hould touch a barre of &s;iluer, but &s;tand vpon our weapons, becau&s;e the Towne was
<PB N="15" REF="12">
full of people, and there was in the Kings trea&s;ure-hou&s;e neere the waters &s;ide, more gold and jewels then all our foure Pinna&s;es could carry, which wee would pre|&s;ently &s;et &s;ome in hand to breake open, notwith&s;tan|ding the Spaniards reports of the &s;trength of it.</P>
<P>Wee were no &s;ooner returned to our &s;trength, but there was a report brought by &s;ome of our men, that our Pinna&s;es were in danger to be taken, and that if we our &s;elues got not aboard before day, we &s;hould be op|pre&s;t with multitude both of Souldiers and townes-people. This report had his ground from one <HI>Diego</HI> a <HI>Ne|gro,</HI> who in the time of the fir&s;t conflict, came and called to our Pinnaces, to knowe whether they were Captaine <HI>Drakes?</HI> &amp; vpon an&s;wer receiued, continued intreating to be taken aboard (though he had fir&s;t three or foure &s;hot made at him) vntill at length they fetcht him, and lear|ned by him, that not pa&s;t eight dayes before our arri|uall the King had &s;ent thether &s;ome hundred and fifty Souldiers to guard the Towne again&s;t the <HI>Symerons,</HI> and the Towne at this time was full of people be&s;ides: which, all the rather beleeued, becau&s;e it agreed with the report of the Negroes, which wee tooke before at the Ile of <HI>Pinos:</HI> and therefore our Captaine &s;ent his brother and <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> to vnder&s;tand the truth thereof. They found our men, which we left in our Pinnaces, much frighted, by rea&s;on that they &s;awe great Troops and Companies running vp and downe, with matches light, &s;ome with other weapons; crying <HI>Que gente? que gente?</HI> which hauing not beene at the fir&s;t conflict, but comming from the vtter ends of the Towne (being at lea&s;t as bigge as <HI>Plimouth</HI>) came many times neere vs, and vnder&s;tanding that we were Engli&s;h, di&s;charged their peeces and ran away.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="13">Pre&s;ently after this, a mighty &s;hower of raine, with a terrible &s;torme of thunder and lightning, fell, which powred downe &s;o vehemently (as it v&s;ually doth in tho&s;e Countries) that before we could recouer the &s;hel|ter of a certaine &s;hade or pent-hou&s;e, at the We&s;ter end of the Kings trea&s;ure-hou&s;e (which &s;eemeth to haue beene built there of purpo&s;e to auoid Sunne and raine) &s;ome of our bow-&s;trings were wet, and &s;ome of our match and powder hurt: which while we were carefull of, to refurni&s;h and &s;upply; diuers of our men, har|ping on the reports lately brought vs, were muttering of the Forces of the Towne, which our Captaine per|ceiuing, told them, that he had brought them to the mouth of the trea&s;ure of the world, if they would want it, they might henceforth blame no body but them|&s;elues. And therefore as &s;oone as the &s;torme beganne to a&s;wage of his furye (which was a long halfe houre) willing to giue his men no longer lea&s;ure to demurre of tho&s;e doubts, nor yet allow the Enemy farther re&s;|pit to gather them&s;elues together: he &s;tept foreward, commanding his brother, with <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> and the Company appointed them, to breake the Kings Trea|&s;ure-hou&s;e; the re&s;t to follow him, to keepe the &s;trength of the market place, till they had di&s;patched the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e for which they came.</P>
<P>But as he &s;tept forward, his &s;trength and &s;ight and &s;peech failed him, and he began to faint for want of blood, which as then wee perceiued, had, in great quantity, i&s;&s;ued vpon the &s;and, out of a wound recei|ued in his legge in the fir&s;t encounter, whereby though he felt &s;ome paine, yet (for that hee perceiued diuers of the Company, hauing already gotten many good things, to be very ready to take all occa&s;ions, of win|ding
<PB N="17" REF="13">
them&s;elues, out of that conceited danger) would he not haue it knowne to any, till this his fainting, again&s;t his will, bewrayed it; the blood hauing fir&s;t filled the very prints which our foote-&s;teps made, to the great di&s;may of all our Company, who thought it not credible, that one man &s;hould be able to &s;pare &s;o much blood and liue.</P>
<P>And therefore euen they, which were willinge&s;t to haue aduentured mo&s;t, for &s;o faire a booty, would in no ca&s;e hazard their Captaines life; but (hauing gi|uen him &s;omewhat to drinke wherewith he recouered him&s;elfe, and hauing bound his Scarfe about his legge, for the &s;topping of the blood) entreated him to bee content to goe with them aboord, there to haue his wound &s;earched and dre&s;t, and then to returne a &s;hoare againe if he thought good.</P>
<P>This when they could not per&s;wade him vnto (as who knew it vtterly time) impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t very vn|likely, that euer they &s;hould (for that) returne againe, to recouer the &s;tate in which they now were: and was of opinion, that it were more honorable for him&s;elfe, to jeopard his life for &s;o great a benefit, then to leaue off &s;o high an enterpri&s;e vnperformed:) they joyned altogether, and with force mingled with faire intreaty, they bare him aboard his Pinnace, and &s;o abandoned a mo&s;t rich &s;poile for the pre&s;ent, only to pre&s;erue their Captaines life, as being re&s;olued of him, that while they enjoyed his pre&s;ence, and had him to com|mand them, they might recouer wealth &s;ufficient; but if once they lo&s;t him, they &s;hould hardly bee able to recouer home, no not with that which they had got|ten already.</P>
<P>Thus wee embarqued by breake of the day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuly. 29.</NOTE> hauing

be&s;ides our Captaine, many of our men wounded, though none &s;laine but one Trumpetter: whereupon though our Chyrurgeons were bu&s;ily employed, in pro|uiding remedies and &s;alues for their wounds: yet the maine care was re&s;pected by all the re&s;t; &s;o that before we departed out of the Harbour for the more com|fort of our Company, wee tooke the afore&s;aid Ship of Wines without great re&s;i&s;tance. But before we had her free off the Hauen, they of the Towne had made meanes to bring one of their Culuerins, which we had di&s;mounted, &s;o as they made a &s;hot at vs, but hin|dred vs not from carrying forth the prize to the Ile <HI>Ba|&s;timientos,</HI> or <HI>The Ile of victualles</HI>; which is an Iland that lyeth without the Bay to the We&s;twards, about a league off the Towne, where we &s;tayed the two next dayes, to cure our wounded men, and refre&s;h our &s;elues, in the goodly Gardens which we there found, abounding with great &s;tore of all dainty rootes and fruites, be&s;ides great plenty of Poultry and other Fowles, no le&s;&s;e &s;trange then delicate.</P>
<P>Shortly, vpon our fir&s;t arriuall in this Iland, the Gouernour and the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the Towne (as wee afterwards vnder&s;tood) &s;ent vnto our Cap|taine a proper Gentleman of meane &s;tature, good complexion, and faire &s;poken, a principall Soul|dier of the late &s;ent Garri&s;on, to view in what &s;tate wee were. At his comming hee prote&s;ted he came to vs of meere good will, for that wee had attempted, &s;o great and incredible a matter with &s;o few men: and that at the fir&s;t they feared that wee had beene French, at who&s;e hands they knew they &s;hould finde no mercy: but after they perceiued by our Arrowes, that we were Engli&s;hmen, their feare were the le&s;&s;e, for that they
<PB N="19" REF="14">
knew, that though we tooke the Trea&s;ure of the place, yet we would not v&s;e cruelty towards their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But albeit this his affection gaue him cau&s;e enough, to come aboard &s;uch, who&s;e vertues &s;o he honoured, yet the Gouernour al&s;o had not only con&s;ented to his comming, but directly &s;ent him, vpon occa&s;ion that diuers of the Towne affirmed (&s;aid hee) that they knew our Captaine, who the la&s;t two yeares had beene often on their coa&s;t, and had alwayes v&s;ed their per|&s;ons very well. And therefore de&s;ired to knowe, fir&s;t, whether our Captaine were the &s;ame Captaine <HI>Drake</HI> or no? and next, becau&s;e many of their men were wounded with our Arrowes, whether they were poy|&s;oned or no? and how their wounds might be&s;t be cured? la&s;tly what victualles wee wanted, or other nece&s;&s;aries? of which the Gouereour promi&s;ed by him to &s;upply and furni&s;h vs, as largely as hee dur&s;t. Our Captaine although he thought this Souldier but a Spye: yet v&s;ed him very curteou&s;ly, and an&s;wered him to his Gouernours demands. That he was the &s;ame <HI>Drake</HI> whome they meant: it was neuer his manner to poy&s;on his Arrowes: they might cure their wounded by ordinary Chirurgery: as for wants hee knewe the Iland of <HI>Ba&s;timientos</HI> had &s;ufficient, and could furni&s;h him if hee li&s;ted: but hee wanted nothing but &s;ome of that &s;peciall commodity, which that Countrey yeel|ded, to content him&s;elfe and his Company. And therefore hee adui&s;ed the Gouernour to hold open his eyes, for before he departed, if God lent him life and leaue, he meant to reape &s;ome of their Harue&s;t, which they get out of the Earth, and &s;end into <HI>Spaine</HI> to trou|ble all the Earth.</P>
<P>To this an&s;were vnlooked for, this Gentleman

replyed: If he might without offence moue &s;uch a que|&s;tion, what &s;hould then be the cau&s;e, of our departing from that Towne at this time, where was aboue three hundred and &s;ixty Tunne of &s;iluer ready for the Fleete, &amp; much more Golde in value, re&s;ting in yron che&s;ts in the Kings Trea&s;ure-hou&s;e? But when our Captaine had &s;hewed him the true cau&s;e of his vnwilling retreat aboord; he acknowledged, that we had no le&s;&s;e rea&s;on in departing, then courage in attempting: and no doubt did ea&s;ily &s;ee, that it was not for the Towne to &s;eeke reuenge of vs, by manning forth &s;uch Fregates or other ve&s;&s;els, as they had: but better to content them&s;elues and prouide for their owne defence. Thus with great fauour and courteous entertainement, be|&s;ides &s;uch gifts from our Captaine as mo&s;t conten|ted him: after dinner hee was in &s;uch &s;ort di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to make report of that he had &s;eene, that he prote&s;ted, he was neuer &s;o much honored of any in his life.</P>
<P>After his departure, the Negroe forementioned, being examined more fully, confirmed this report of the gold and &s;iluer, with many other intelligences of importance, e&s;pecially how wee might haue gold and &s;iluer enough if we would, by meanes of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> whome though hee had betrayed diuers times (being v&s;ed thereto by his Ma&s;ters) &s;o that he knew they would kill him, if they gat him: yet if our Captaine would vndertake his protection, hee dur&s;t aduenture his life, becau&s;e hee knewe our Captaines name was mo&s;t pre|tious and highly honored of them.</P>
<P>This report mini&s;tred occa&s;ion to further con&s;ul|tation: for which, becau&s;e this place &s;eemed not the &s;afe&s;t; as being neither the healthie&s;t nor quiete&s;t. The next day in the morning wee all &s;et our cour&s;e

<P>This report our Captaine credited, the rather, for that him&s;elfe had heard the report of the Ordinance, at &s;ea, and perceiued &s;ufficiently, that hee was now de&s;cried: notwith&s;tanding, in farther examination, of this old mariner, hauing vnder&s;tood, that there was, within the next point, a great &s;hip of Siuell, which had here di&s;charged her loading, and rid now with her yards a cro&s;&s;e, being bound the next mor|ning for Saint <HI>Domingo:</HI> our Captaine tooke this old man into his Pinnace to verifie that which hee had

informed, and rowed towards this Ship, which as wee came neere it, hayled vs, asking whence our Shallops were? wee an&s;wered, from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI>: &s;traight way they raild and reuiled: wee gaue no heed to their words, but euery Pinnace, according to our Captaines order: one on the &s;tarboord bough, the other on the &s;tarboord quarter, and the Captaine in the mid&s;hip on the larboord &s;ide, forthwith boarded her, though wee had &s;ome difficulty to enter, by rea|&s;on of her height, being of two hundred forty Tunne. But a&s;&s;oone as wee entred vpon the decks, we threwe downe the grates and &s;pardecks, to preuent the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from annoying vs with their clo&s;e fights: who then perceiuing that wee were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Ship, &s;towed them&s;elues all in hold with their wea|pons, except two or three yonkers, which were found afore the beetes: when hauing light out of our Pinna|ces, wee found no danger of the enemy remaining, wee cut their Cables at halfe, and with our three Pinnaces, towed her without the Iland, into the &s;ound right afore the Towne, without danger of their great &s;hott.</P>
<P>Meane while, the Towne hauing intelligence here|of, by their watch, tooke th'alarme, rong out their Bells, &s;hott off about thirty Peeces of great Ordi|nance, put all their men in a readines hor&s;e and foote, came downe to the very point of the wood, and di&s;|charged their Caliuers, to impeach vs if they might, in going forth.</P>
<P>The next morning our Ships tooke two Fregats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 14.</NOTE> in which were two, who called them&s;elues the Kings <HI>Scriuanos,</HI> the one of <HI>Carthagene,</HI> th'other of <HI>Veragua,</HI> with &s;eauen Mariners and two Negroes: who had
<PB N="24" REF="17">
beene at <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and were now bound for <HI>Ca+thagene,</HI> with double letters of adui&s;e, to certifie them that Captaine <HI>Drake had beene at Nombre de Dios, had taken it, and had it not beene that hee was hurt with &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed &s;hott, by all likelihood hee had &s;ackt it: hee was yet &s;till vpon the Coa&s;t: they &s;hould therefore carefully prepare for him.</HI></P>
<P>After that our Captaine had brought all his fleet together: at the <HI>Scriuanos</HI> entreaties, hee was content to doe them all fauor, in &s;etting them and all their companies a &s;hore; and &s;o bare thence with the Ilands of Saint <HI>Barnards,</HI> about three leagues off the Towne: where wee found great &s;tore of fi&s;h for our refre&s;hing.</P>
<P>Here our Captaine con&s;idering that hee was now di&s;couered, vpon 2. of the cheefe&s;t places of all the Coa&s;t, and yet not meaning to leaue it, till hee had found the <HI>Simerons,</HI> and made his voiage, as hee had con|ceiued, which would require &s;ome length of time &amp; &s;ure manning of his Pinnaces, hee determined with him|&s;elfe, to burne one of his Ships, and make of the o|ther a &s;torehou&s;e, that his Pinnaces (which could not o|therwi&s;e) might be throughly mand, and &s;o he might be able to abide any time. But knowing the affection of his company, how loath they were to leaue either of their Ships, being both &s;o good Saylers and &s;o well furni&s;hed, hee purpo&s;ed in him&s;elfe by &s;ome pollicy, to make them mo&s;t willing to effect that hee intended. And therefore &s;ent for one <HI>Thomas Moone</HI> (who was Carpenter in the Swanne) and taking him into his Cabbin, chargeth him to conceale for a time, a peice of &s;eruice, which hee mu&s;t in any ca&s;e con&s;ent to doe aboord his owne Ship: that was, in the middle of the &s;econd watch, to goe downe &s;ecretly into the well of

the Ship, and with a great &s;pike-gimlet, to boare three hoales, as neere the keele as hee could, and lay &s;omething again&s;t it, that the force of the water en|tring, might make no great noi&s;e, nor be di&s;couered by boyling vp: <HI>Thomas Moone</HI> at the hearing hereof being vtterly di&s;maied, de&s;ired to knowe what cau&s;e there might bee, to moue him to &s;incke &s;o good a Bark, of his owne, new, and &s;trong, and that by his meanes, who had beene in two &s;o rich and gainefull voyages in her with him&s;elfe heretofore: If his bro|ther, the Ma&s;ter, and the re&s;t of the company &s;hould knowe of &s;uch his fact, hee thought verily they would kill him. But when our Captaine had imparted to him his cau&s;es, and had per&s;waded him with promi&s;e that it &s;hould not bee knowne, till all of them &s;hould bee glad of it: hee vndertooke it, and did it accor|dingly.</P>
<P>The next morning our Captaine tooke his Pinnace very early,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 15.</NOTE> purpo&s;ing to goe a fi&s;hing (for that there is very great &s;tore on all the Coa&s;t) and falling aboord the Swanne, calleth for his brother to goe with him, who ri&s;ing &s;uddenly, an&s;wereth that hee would follow pre&s;ently, or if it would plea&s;e him to &s;tay a very little, hee would attend him. Our Captaine perceiuing the feate wrought, would not ha&s;ten him, but in rowing away, demanded of them, why their Bark was &s;o deepe? as making no great account of it: but by occa|&s;ion of this demand, his brother &s;ent one downe to the Steward, to know whether there were any water in the Ship? or what other cau&s;e might bee? The Stew|ard ha&s;tily &s;tepping downe at his v&s;uall skuttle, was wett vp to the wa&s;te, and &s;hifting with more ha&s;t to come vp againe as if the water had followed him, cryed
<PB N="26" REF="18">
out that the Ship was full of water. There was no need to ha&s;ten the company, &s;ome to the pumpe, others to &s;earch for the leake, which the Captaine of the Bark &s;eeing they did on all hands very willingly, hee fol|lowed his brother, and certified him of the &s;trange chance befalne them that night; that whereas they had not pumpt twi&s;e in &s;ix weekes before, now they had &s;ix foote water in hold: therefore hee de&s;ireth leaue from attending him in fi&s;hing, to intend the &s;earch and remedy of the leake: and when our Captaine with his company profered to goe to helpe them, hee an&s;wered, they had men enough aboord, and prayed him to continue his fi&s;hing, that they might haue &s;ome part of it for their dinner. Thus returning, hee found his company had taken great paine, but had freeed the water very little: yet &s;uch was their loue to the Barke (as our Captaine well knew) that they cea&s;ed not, but to the vtmo&s;t of their &s;trength, laboured all that they might till three in the afternoone: by which time, the company per|ceiuing, that though they had beene relieued by our Captaine him&s;elfe and many of his company, yet they were not able to free aboue a foote and a halfe of wa|ter, and could haue no likelihood of finding the leake, had now a le&s;&s;e liking of her then before, and greater content to hear of &s;ome means fot remedy: wherevpon our Captaine con&s;ulting with them what they thought be&s;t to bee done: found that they had more de&s;ire to haue all as he thought fitt, then iudgement to con|ceiue any meanes of remedy. And therefore hee pro|pounded, that him&s;elfe would goe in the Pinnace, till hee could prouide him &s;ome han&s;ome Fregate, and that his brother &s;hould bee Captaine in the ad|mirall,
<PB N="27" REF="18">
and the Ma&s;ter &s;hould al&s;o bee there placed with him, in&s;teed of this: which &s;eeing they could not &s;aue, hee would haue fired, that th'enemy might neuer recouer her: but fir&s;t all the Pinnaces &s;hould bee brought aboord her, that euery one might take out of her what&s;oeuer they lackt or liked. This, though the company at the fir&s;t marueiled at, yet pre&s;ently it was put in execution and performed that night: our Captaine had his de&s;ire, and men enough for his Pin|naces.</P>
<P>The next morning, wee re&s;olued to &s;eeke out &s;ome fitt place, in the &s;ound of <HI>Darienne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 16.</NOTE> where wee might &s;afely leaue our Shipp at Anchor, not di&s;coue|rable by the enemy, who thereby might imagine vs quite departed from the Coa&s;t, and wee the meane time better follow our purpo&s;es with our Pinnaces; of which our Captaine would him&s;elfe take two to <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> and the third leaue with his brother to &s;eeke the <HI>Symerons.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon this re&s;olution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 21.</NOTE> wee &s;et &s;aile pre&s;ently for the &s;aid &s;ound: which within fiue dayes wee recoue|red, ab&s;teining of purpo&s;e, from all &s;uch occa&s;ion, as might hinder our determination, or bewray our being vpon the Coa&s;t. A&s;&s;oone as we arriued, where our Captaine intended, and had cho&s;en a fit and conuenient road (out of all trade) for our pur|po&s;e; wee repo&s;ed our &s;elues there, for &s;ome fifteene dayes, keeping our &s;elues clo&s;e, that the brute of our being vpon the Coa&s;t might cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the meane time wee were not idle: for be|&s;ides &s;uch ordinary workes, as our Captaine euery month did v&s;ually enure vs to, about the trimming and fitting of his Pinnaces, for their better &s;ayling

Our Archers made them&s;elues Butts to &s;hoot at, becau&s;e wee had many that delighted in that exerci&s;e, and wanted not a Fletcher to keepe our Bowes and Arrowes in order. The re&s;t of the com|pany, euery one as hee liked be&s;t, made his di&s;port at Boules, Quoits, Keiles, &amp;c. For our Captaine al|lowed one halfe of their company to pa&s;&s;e their time thus, euery other day interchangeably, the other halfe being enioyned to the nece&s;&s;ary workes, about our Ship and Pinnaces, and the prouiding of fre&s;h victuall, Fi&s;h, Foule, Hogs, Deere, Conies, &amp;c. whereof there is great plenty.

<P>The &s;ame day wee departed thence to <HI>Rio grand,</HI> where wee entred about three of the clocke in the af|ter-noone. There are two entrings into this Riuer, of which we entred the We&s;termo&s;t called <HI>Boca chica.</HI> The fre&s;het of this Riuer is &s;o great, that we being halfe a league from the mouth of it, filled fre&s;h water for our beuerage.</P>
<P>From three a clocke till darke night wee rowed vp the &s;treame, but the current was &s;o &s;trong downewards, that we got but two leagues all that time. We moared our Pinnaces to a tree that night: for that pre&s;ently with the clo&s;ing of the euening, there fell a mon&s;trous &s;hower of raine, with &s;uch &s;trange and terrible claps of thunder, and fla&s;hes of lightning, as made vs, not a little to meruell at, although our Captaine had beene acquainted with &s;uch like in that Countrey, and told vs that they continue, &s;eldome longer then three quar|ters of an houre. This &s;torme was no &s;ooner cea&s;t, but it became very calme, and therewith there came &s;uch an innumerable multitude, of a kind of Flies of that Coun|trey called <HI>Muskitos</HI> (like our Gnats) which bite &s;o &s;pitefully, that we could not re&s;t all that night, nor find meanes to defend our &s;elues from them, by rea&s;on of the heate of the Countrey: the be&s;t remedy wee then found again&s;t them, was the juyce of Lemmons.</P>

Then we e&s;pied a Canow with two Indians fi&s;hing in the Riuer: but we &s;pake not to them, lea&s;t &s;o wee might be de&s;cried: nor they to vs, as taking vs to be Spaniards. But with|in an houre after wee e&s;pyed certaine hou&s;es, on the other &s;ide of the Riuer, who&s;e channell is twenty fiue fathome deepe, and his bredth &s;o great, that a man can &s;cantly be di&s;cerned from &s;ide to &s;ide. Yet a Spaniard which kept tho&s;e hou&s;es, had e&s;pied our Pinnaces, and thinking wee had beene his Countrey-men, made a &s;moake, for a &s;ignall to turne that way, as being de&s;i|rous to &s;peake with vs. After that, we e&s;pying this &s;moak, had made with it, and were halfe the Riuer ouer, he wheaued vs with his hat, and his long hanging &s;leeues to come a&s;hoare: But as we drew neerer vnto him, and he di&s;cerned that we were not tho&s;e he looked for, he tooke his heeles, and fled from his hou&s;es, which we found to be, fiue in number, all full of white Ruske, dryed Bacon, that Country Chee&s;e (like Holland Chee&s;e in fa&s;hion, but farre more delicate in ta&s;te, of which they &s;end into <HI>Spayne</HI> as &s;peciall Pre&s;ents) many &s;ortes of &s;weet Meats, and Con&s;erues; with great &s;tore of Sugar: being pro|uided to &s;erue the Fleet returning to <HI>Spayne.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo. 17.</NOTE>This euening wee departed to Sea: and the day following, being &s;ome two leagues off the Harbor, wee tooke a Bark, and found that the Captaine and his wife with the better &s;ort of the Pa&s;&s;engers, had for|&s;aken her, and were gone a &s;hore in their Gundeloe: by occa&s;ion whereof wee boorded without re&s;i&s;tance, though they were very well prouided, with Swords and Targets and &s;ome &s;mall Shott, be&s;ides foure iron Ba&s;es.

<P>The next day in the afternoone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo. 20.</NOTE> there came out of <HI>Carthagene,</HI> two Fregats bound for Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> the one of fifty, th'other of twelue Tonne, hauing nothing in them but balla&s;t: wee tooke them, within a league of the Towne, and came to Anchor with them, with|in Saker &s;hort of the Ea&s;t Bulwark: there were in tho&s;e Fregats &s;ome twelue or thirteene common Mariners, which intreated to bee &s;et a &s;hoare: to them our Cap|taine gaue the great Fregates Gundelow, and di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The next morning when they came downe to the We&s;ter point with a flagge of Truce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo. 21.</NOTE> our Captaine mand one of his Pinnaces and rowed a &s;hoare: when wee were within a Cables length of the &s;hoare, the Spaniards fled, hiding them&s;elues in the Woods, as being afraid of our Ordinance; but indeed to drawe
<PB N="40" REF="25">
vs on to land confidently, and to pre&s;ume of our &s;trength. Our Captaine commanding the Grapnell to bee ca&s;t out of the &s;terne, veered the Pinnace a &s;hore, and a&s;&s;oone as &s;hee touched the &s;and, hee a|lone leapt a&s;hore in their &s;ight, to declare that hee dur&s;t &s;et his foote a land, but &s;tayed not among them: to let them knowe, that though hee had not &s;ufficient forces to conquere them, yet hee had &s;ufficent iudge|ment to take heed of them. And therefore perceiuing their intent, a&s;&s;oone as our Captaine was aboord, we haled off vppon our Grapner and rid a while. They pre&s;ently came forth vpon the &s;and, and &s;ent a youth, as with a me&s;&s;age from the Gouernor, to know what our intent was, to &s;tay thus vpon the Coa&s;t? our Cap|taine an&s;wered hee ment to traffique with them: for hee had Tinne, Pewter, Cloth and other Marchan|dize that they needed. The youth &s;wam back againe with this an&s;were; and was pre&s;ently returned, with another me&s;&s;age: that, The King had forbidden to traffique with any forraine Nation for any commodities, ex|cept Powder and Shotte, of which if hee had any &s;tore, they would bee his Marchants; hee an&s;wered, that he was come from his Country, to exchange his commo|dities for Gold and Siluer, and is not purpo&s;ed to re|turne without his errand. They are like (in his opini|on) to haue little re&s;t, if that by faire meanes they would not traffique with him. He gaue this Me&s;&s;enger a faire Shirt for a reward, and &s;o returned him: who rolled his Shirt about his head and &s;wamme very &s;pe|dily.</P>
<P>We heard no an&s;were all that day, and therefore toward night wee went aboord our Fregats and repo|&s;ed our &s;elues, &s;etting and keeping very orderly all
<PB N="41" REF="25">
that night our watch, with great and &s;mall &s;hott.</P>
<P>The next morning the winde which had beene we&s;t|erly in the euening, altered to the ea&s;tward. About the dawning of the day, wee e&s;pied two Sayles tur|ning towards vs, where vpon our Captaine waighed with his Pinnaces, leauing the two Fregats vnmand. But when wee were come &s;omewhat nigh them, the winde calmed, and wee were faine to rowe towards them, till that approaching very nigh wee &s;awe many heads peering ouer boord. For, as wee perceiued, the&s;e two Fregates were mand and &s;et forth out of <HI>Car|thagene,</HI> to fight with vs, and at lea&s;t to empeach or bu&s;y vs, whil&s;t by &s;ome meanes or other they might recouer the Fregates from vs: but our Captaine pre|uented both their drifts. For commanding <HI>Iohn Ox|nam</HI> to &s;tay with the one Pinnace, to entertaine the&s;e two men of warre, him&s;elfe in the other made &s;uch &s;peed, that hee gate to his Fregates which hee had left at Anchor, and cau&s;ed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (who in the meane time had gotten aboord in a &s;mall Canow thinking to haue towed them within the danger of their &s;hott) to make greater ha&s;t thence, then they did thither. For hee found that in &s;hifting thence, &s;ome of them were faine to &s;wim a land (the Canow not being able to receiue them) and had left their ap|parell, &s;ome their Rapiers and Targets, &s;ome their Flaskes and Calliuers behinde them, although they were towing away of one of them: therefore con&s;ide|ring that wee could not man them, wee &s;unck the one, and burnt the other, giuing them to vnder&s;tand by this, that wee perceiued their &s;ecret practi&s;es.</P>
<P>This being done, he returned to <HI>Iohn Oxnam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo. 22.</NOTE> who all this while lay by the men of warre without proffe|ring
<PB N="42" REF="26">
of fight. And a&s;&s;oone as our Captaine was come vp to the&s;e Fregates, the wind blew much from the Sea, &s;o that, wee being betwixt the &s;hoare and them, were in a manner forced to beare roome into the Harbor before them, to the great ioy of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> who beheld it, in &s;uppo&s;ing, that wee would &s;till haue fled before them. But a&s;&s;oone as wee were in the Harbor, and felt &s;mooth water, our Pinnaces (as we were a&s;&s;ured of) getting the winde, wee fought with them vpon th'aduantage, &s;o that after a fewe &s;hott exchanged, and a &s;torme ri&s;ing, they were con|tented to pre&s;&s;e no neerer. Therefore as they lett fall their Anchors, wee pre&s;ently let drop our Grapners in the wind of them, which the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers &s;ee|ing, con&s;idering the di&s;aduantage of the winde, the likelihood of the &s;torme to continue, and &s;mall hope of doing any good, they were glad to retire them|&s;elues to the Towne. But by rea&s;on of the foule and tempe&s;tuous weather, wee rode there foure dayes, feeling great cold, by rea&s;on wee had &s;uch &s;ore raines with we&s;terly winde, and &s;o little &s;uccor in our Pinna|ces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Octo. 27.</NOTE>The fift day after, there came in a Fregate from the Sea, which &s;eeing vs make towards her, ranne her&s;elfe a &s;hore, vnhanging her Rudder and taking away her Sayles, that &s;hee might not ea&s;ily bee car|ried avvay. But when we were come vp to her, we per|ceiued about a hundred hor&s;e and foote, with their furniture, came downe to the point of the maine, where wee interchanged &s;ome &s;hott with them. One of our great &s;hort pa&s;t &s;o neere a braue Caualiere of theirs, that thereby they were occa&s;ioned to adui&s;e them&s;elues, and retreat into the woods, where they
<PB N="43" REF="26">
might &s;ufficiently defend and re&s;cue the Fregate from vs, and annoy vs al&s;o, if wee &s;tayed long about her. Therefore we concluded to goe to Sea againe, putting forth through <HI>Boca chica,</HI> with intent to take downe our Ma&s;ts, vpon hope of faire wether, and to ride vnder the Rocks called <HI>Las Serenas,</HI> which are two leagues off at Sea, as wee had v&s;ually done aforetime, &s;o that they could not de&s;erne vs from the Rocks. But there the Sea was &s;o mightily growne, that wee were for|ced to take the Harbor againe: where wee remained &s;ixe dayes, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> greeued greatly at our aboade there &s;o long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nouem. 2.</NOTE> put an other de|uice in practi&s;e to indanger vs.</P>
<P>For they &s;ent forth a great Shallop, a fine Gunde|loe, and a great Canow, with certaine <HI>Spanyards</HI> with Shott, and many <HI>Indians</HI> with poi&s;oned Ar|rowes, as it &s;eemed, with intent to begin &s;ome fight, and then to fly. For a&s;&s;oone as wee rowed towards them and enterchanged &s;hotte, they pre&s;ently reti|red and went a &s;hoare into the woods, where an Am|bu&s;h of &s;ome &s;ixty &s;hott were layde for vs: be&s;ides two Pinnaces and a Fregate warping towards vs, which were mand as the re&s;t. They atttemed vs very boldly, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e others, which from out of the wood, had gotten aboord the Gundelo and Canow, and &s;eeing vs bearing from them (which wee did in re&s;pect of the Ambu&s;cado) they incouraged them&s;elues and a&s;&s;ured their fellowes of the day. But our Captaine weighing this their attempt, and being out of danger of their &s;hott from the land, comman|ding his other Pinnace to be brought a head of him, and to let fall their Grapners each a head the other, enuironed both the Pinnaces with Bonnets, as for a
<PB N="44" REF="27">
clo&s;e fight, and then wheaued them aboord him.</P>
<P>They kept them&s;elues vpon their Oares at Calli|uer &s;hott di&s;tance, &s;pending powder apace, as wee did &s;ome two or three houres; we had one of our men onely, wounded in that fight: what they had is vn|knowe to vs, but wee &s;awe their Pinnaces &s;hotte through in diuers places, and the powder of one of them tooke on fire: vvhereupon vvee vvaighed, inten|ding to beare roome, to ouer-run them: vvhich they perceiuing and thinking that vvee vvould haue boor|ded them, rovved avvay amaine to the defence vvhich they had in the vvood, the rather becau&s;e they vvere di&s;appointed of their helpe, that they expected from the Fregate vvhich vvas vvarping tovvards vs, but by rea&s;on of the much vvinde that blevv, could not come to offend vs, or &s;uccour them.</P>
<P>Thus &s;eeing that wee were &s;till mole&s;ted, and no hope remained of any purcha&s;e to bee had, in this place any longer, becau&s;e vve vvere novv &s;o notably made knovvne in tho&s;e parts, and becau&s;e our victuals grevvv &s;cant, as &s;oone as the vveather vvexed &s;ome|vvhat better (the Wind continuing alvvayes We&s;ter|ly, &s;o that vve could not returne to our Shippes) our Captaine thought be&s;t to goe to the Ea&s;tvvard, to|vvards <HI>Rio grand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nou. 3.</NOTE> along&s;t the Coa&s;t, vvhere vvee had beene before, and found great &s;tore of victuals.</P>

not be releeued by them. Herewith being very &s;or|ry becau&s;e much of our victuall in our Pinnaces was &s;poild, by the foule weather at Sea, and raines in Har|bour: a Fregate being de&s;cryed at Sea reuiued vs, and put vs in &s;ome hope for the time, that in her we &s;hould finde &s;ufficient; and thereupon it may ea&s;ily be gue&s;|&s;ed, how much wee laboured to recouer her: but when we had boarded her, and vnder&s;tood, that &s;hee had neither meate nor money, but that &s;he was bound for <HI>Rio grand,</HI> to take in proui&s;ion vpon bils, our great hope conuerted into greefe.</P>
<P>Wee endured with our allowance &s;eauen or eight dayes more, proceeding to the Ea&s;twards, and bea|ring roome for <HI>Santa Martha,</HI> vpon hope to finde &s;ome &s;hipping in the Roade, or Limpets on the Rockes, or &s;uccour again&s;t the &s;torme in that good Harbor. Being arriued, and &s;eeing no &s;hipping, we anchored vnder the We&s;ter point, where is high land, and, as we thought, free &s;afety from the Towne, which is in the bottome of the Bay, not intending to land there, becau&s;e wee knew that it was fortified, and that they had intelligence of vs. But the Spaniards knowing vs to be Men of warre, and mi&s;liking that wee &s;hould &s;hroud vnder their Rockes, without their leaue, had conueyed &s;ome thirty or forty &s;hot among the cliffes, which annoyed vs &s;o &s;pitefully and &s;o vnreuengedly (for that they lay hidden behind the Rockes, but wee lay open to them) that wee were &s;oone weary of our Harbour, and enforced, for all the &s;torme without, and want within, to put to Sea, which though the&s;e Ene|mies of ours were well contented withall, yet for a farewell, as wee came open of the Towne, they &s;ent vs a Culuerine &s;hot, which made a neere e&s;cape, for

it fell betweene our Pinnaces, as wee were vpon con|ference of what was be&s;t to be done.

But towards night our Captaine called all of vs aboard, (onely leauing the Spaniards lately taken in the Prize a&s;hoare, according to our promi&s;e made them, to their great content, who acknowledged that our Captaine did them a farre greater fauour, in &s;etting them freely at liberty, then hee had done them di&s;|plea&s;ure in taking their Ship) and &s;o &s;et &s;ayle.</P>
<P>The &s;ickene&s;&s;e which had begunne to kindle among&s;t two or three dayes before, did this day &s;hewe it &s;elfe, in <HI>Charles Glub,</HI> one of our Quarter-Ma&s;ters, a very tall man, and a right good Mariner, taken away to the great greefe both of Captaine and Company. What the cau&s;e of this malady was, we knewe nor of certainety, we imputed it to the colde, which our men had taken, lying without &s;uccour in the Pinnaces. But how&s;oeuer it was, thus it plea|&s;ed God to vi&s;it vs, and yet in fauour to re&s;tore vnto health, all the re&s;t of our Company, that were tou|ched with this di&s;ea&s;e, which were not a few.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nouem. 15.</NOTE>The next morning being faire weather, though the Winde continued contrary, our Captaine com|manded the <HI>Minion</HI> his le&s;&s;er Pinnace, to ha&s;ten away before him towards his Shippes at <HI>Fort Diego</HI> within the <HI>Cabe&ccedil;as</HI> to cary newes of his comming, and to put all things in a readine&s;&s;e for our Land journey, if they heare any thing of the Fleets arriuall by the <HI>Simerons,</HI> giuing the <HI>Minion</HI> charge if they wanted Wine, to take <HI>Saint Bernards</HI> in their way, and there take in &s;ome &s;uch portion as they thought good, of the Wines which we had there hidden in the &s;and.</P>

<P>The manner of it (as wee learned by examination of the Company) was this: when they &s;aw this Fre|gate at Sea, (as they were going towards their Fort with planckes to make the Platformes) the Com|pany were very importunate on him, to giue cha&s;e and &s;et vpon this Fregate, which they deemed had beene a fit booty for them.

But when this would not &s;atisfie them, but that &s;till they vrged him with words and &s;uppo&s;als: If you will needs &s;aid he aduenture, it &s;hall neuer be &s;aid that I will be hindmo&s;t, neither &s;hall you report to my Bro|ther, that you lo&s;t your voyage by any covvardi&s;e you found in me.</P>

For when he had prepared to take his journey for <HI>Panama</HI> by land, he gaue <HI>Edward Hixom</HI> charge of his owne Ship and Company, &amp; e&s;pe|cially of tho&s;e Spaniards whome hee had put into the great Prize, which was haled a &s;hoare to the Iland (which we termed &s;laughter Iland, becau&s;e &s;o many of our men dyed there) and v&s;ed as a &s;tore-hou&s;e for our &s;elues, and a pri&s;on for our Enemies.</P>

<P>We were in all forty eight, of which eighteene onely were Engli&s;h, the re&s;t were <HI>Symerons,</HI> which be&s;ides their Armes, bare euery one of them, a great quantity of victuall and proui&s;ion, &s;upplying our want of cariages in &s;o long a march, &s;o that wee were not troubled with any thing but our furniture.

<P>They haue euery one of them two &s;ortes of Ar|rowes, the one to defend him&s;elfe and offend the ene|my, the other to kill his victualls.

And the&s;e heads though they bee of iron onely, yet are they &s;o cunning|ly tempered, that they will continue a very good edge a long time: and though they bee turned &s;ometimes yet they will neuer or &s;eldome breake.

<P>Euery day wee were marching by Sun-ri&s;ing: wee continued till ten in the forenoone: then re&s;ting (euer neere &s;ome Riuer) till pa&s;t twelue, wee marched till foure, and then by &s;ome Riuers &s;ide, wee repo&s;ed our &s;elues in &s;uch hou&s;es, as either wee found prepa|red heretofore by them, when they trauelled through the&s;e woods, or they daily built very readily for vs, in this manner.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oone as wee came to the place, where wee in|tended to lodge, the <HI>Symerons,</HI> pre&s;ently laying downe their burthens, fell to cutting of Forkes or Po&s;ts, and Poles or Rafters, and Palmito boughes, or Plantaine leaues: and with great &s;peed &s;et vp, to the number of &s;ixe hou&s;es. For euery of which, they fir&s;t fa&s;tned deepe into the ground, three or foure great Po&s;tes with Forkes: vpon them, they layde one Tran&s;ome, which was commonly about twentie foote, and made the &s;ides, in the manner of the roofes of our Country hou&s;es, thatching it clo&s;e with tho&s;e afore&s;aid leaues, which keepe out water long time: ob&s;eruing alwayes

that in the lower ground, where greater heate was, they left &s;ome three or foure foote open vnthatcht be|lowe, &amp; made the hou&s;es, or rather roofes, &s;o many foote the higher. But in the Hils, where the ayre was more peircing &amp; the nights colder, they made our roomes al|waies lower, &amp; Thatched them clo&s;e to the ground, lea|uing onely one dore to enter at, and a Louer hole for a vent, in the mid&s;t of the roofe In euery of the&s;e, they made foure &s;euerall lodgings, and three fires, one in the mid&s;t, and one at each end of euery hou&s;e: &s;o that the roome was mo&s;t temperately warme, and nothing annoyed with &s;moake, partly by rea&s;on of the nature of the wood, which they v&s;e to burne, yeelding very litle &s;moake, partly by rea&s;on of their artificiall making of it: as firing the wood cutt in length like our billets, at the ends, and ioyning them together &s;o clo&s;e, that though no flame or fire did appeare, yet the heate con|tinued without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Neere many of the Riuers where wee &s;tayd or lodgd, wee found &s;undry &s;orts of Fruits, which wee might v&s;e with great plea&s;ure and &s;afety temperately, <HI>Mammeas, Guayuas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Limes</HI> and diuers o|ther; from eating of which they di&s;&s;waded vs in any ca&s;e, vnle&s;&s;e wee eate very few of them, and tho&s;e fir&s;t dry roa&s;ted, as <HI>Plantans, Potatos</HI> and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>In iournying, as oft as by chance they found any wilde Swine, of which tho&s;e Hills and Valleys haue &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ore, they would ordinarily, &s;ixe at a time, deliuer their burthens to the re&s;t of their fellowes, and pur|&s;ue, kill and bring away after vs, as much as they could carry, and time permitted. One day as wee trauelled, the <HI>Symerons</HI> found an Otter, and prepared it to bee dre&s;t: our Captaine maruelling at it, <HI>Pedro</HI> (our cheefe

<P>The third day of our iourney, they brought vs to a Towne of their owne, &s;eated neere a faire Riuer, on the &s;ide of a Hill, enuironed with a Dike of eight foote broad, and a thicke mud wall of ten foote high, &s;ufficient to &s;top a &s;udden &s;urpri&s;er. It had one long and broad &s;treet, lying Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and two o|ther cro&s;&s;e &s;treets of le&s;&s;e bredth and length: there were in it &s;ome fiue or &s;ixe and fifty hou&s;eholds, which were kept &s;o cleane and &s;weet, that not onely the hou|&s;es, but the very &s;treets were very plea&s;ant to behold. In this Towne wee &s;awe they liued very ciuilly and cleanely: for a&s;&s;oone as they came thither, they wa&s;hed them&s;elues in the Riuer, and changed their apparell which was very fine and fitly made (as al&s;o their we|men doe weare) &s;omewhat after the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion, though nothing &s;o co&s;tly.

<P>Touching their affection in religion, they haue no kinde of Prei&s;ts, onely they held the Cro&s;&s;e in great reputation: but at our Captaines per&s;wation, they were contented to leaue their Cro&s;&s;es, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> to learne the Lords prayer, and to bee in&s;tructed in &s;ome mea&s;ure concerning Gods true wor&s;hip.

<P>Wee &s;tayed with them that night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 7.</NOTE> and the next day till noone: during which time they related vnto vs diuers very &s;trange accidents, that had fallen out betweene them and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> namely one: A gal|lant Gentleman entertained by the Gouernors of the Country, vndertooke the yeare la&s;t pa&s;t, with a hundred and fiftie Souldiers, to put this Towne to the &s;word, Men, Women, and Children. Being conducted to it by one of them, that had beene taken pri&s;oner, and wonne by great gifts: hee &s;urpri&s;ed it halfe an houre before day, by which occa&s;ion mo&s;t of the men e&s;ca|ped, but many of their women and children were &s;laughtered, or taken: but the &s;ame morning by Sun ri&s;ing, after that their guide was &s;laine, in following another mans wife: and that the <HI>Symerons</HI> had a&s;&s;em|bled them&s;elues in their &s;trength: they behaued them|&s;elues in &s;uch &s;ort, and draue the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;uch ex|tremity, that what with the di&s;aduantage of the woods, hauing lo&s;t their guide and thereby their way, what with famine &amp; want, there e&s;caped not pa&s;t thirty of them, to returne an&s;were to tho&s;e which &s;ent them.</P>
<P>Their King dwelt in a City within &s;ixteene leagues Southea&s;t of <HI>Panama,</HI> which is able to make one thou|&s;and &s;eauen hundred fighting men.</P>

promi&s;ing that by that time, they would double his &s;trength if hee thought good. But hee thanking them for their offer, told them, that hee could &s;tay no lon|ger, it was more then time to pro&s;ecute his purpo&s;ed voiage: as for &s;trength, hee would wi&s;h no more then hee had, although hee might haue pre&s;ently twenty times a&s;much: which they tooke as proceeding not onely from kindnes, but al&s;o from magnanimity, and therefore, they marched forth that afternoone with great good will.</P>
<P>This was the order of our march: Foure of tho&s;e <HI>Symerons</HI> that be&s;t knew the wayes, went about a mile di&s;tance before vs, breaking boughes as they went, to be a direction to tho&s;e that followed: but with great &s;ilence, which they required vs al&s;o to keepe. Then twelue of them were as it were our Vantgard, and o|ther twelue our Reereward: wee with their two Cap|taines in the mid&s;t.</P>
<P>All the way was through woods very coole and plea&s;ant, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e goodly and high Trees, that growe there &s;o thick, that it is cooler trauelling there vnder them in that hot region, then it is in the mo&s;t parts of <HI>England</HI> in the Sommer time. This gaue a &s;peciall encouragement vnto vs all, that wee vnder|&s;tood there was a great Tree about the midway, from which, wee might at once di&s;cerne the North Sea from whence wee came, and the South Sea whether we were going.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 11.</NOTE>The fourth day following wee came to the height of the de&s;ired Hill, (a very high Hill, lying Ea&s;t and We&s;t, like ridge a betweene the two Seas) about ten of the clock: where the chiefe&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Symerons</HI> tooke our Captaine by the hand, and prayed him to

follow him, if hee was de&s;irous to &s;ee at once the two Seas: which hee had &s;o long longed for.</P>
<P>Here was that goodly and great high Tree, in which they had cutt and made diuers &s;teps, to a&s;cend vp neere vnto the top, where they had al&s;o made a conuenient Bower, wherein ten or twelue men might ea&s;ily &s;itt: and from thence wee might without any difficulty plainely &s;ee, <HI>th'Atlantick</HI> Ocean whence now wee came, and the South <HI>Atlantick</HI> &s;o much de&s;ired: South and North of this Tree, they had felld cer|taine Trees, that the pro&s;pect might be the cleerer: and neere about the Tree there were diuers &s;trong hou&s;es, that had beene built long before, a&s;well by other <HI>Sy|merons</HI> as by the&s;e: which v&s;ually pa&s;&s;e that way, as be|ing, inhabited in diuers places in tho&s;e wa&s;te Coun|tries.</P>
<P>After our Captaine had a&s;cended to this Bower, with the cheefe <HI>Symeron,</HI> and hauing as it plea&s;ed God, at that time, by rea&s;on of the brize, a very faire day, had &s;eene that Sea, of which hee had heard &s;uch gol|den reports: hee be&s;ought Almighty God of his goodnes, to giue him life and leaue to &s;ayle once in an Engli&s;h Ship in that Sea: and then calling vp all the re&s;t of our men, acquainted <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> e&s;pecial|ly with this his peticion and purpo&s;e, if it would plea&s;e God to grant him that happines: who vnder|&s;tanding it, pre&s;ently prote&s;ted, that vnle&s;&s;e our Cap|taine did beate him from his company, hee would follow him by Gods grace.</P>

came to march in a Champion Country, where the gra&s;&s;e groweth, not onely in great length as the knot|gra&s;&s;e groweth in many places, but to &s;uch height, that th'inhabitants are faine to burne it thri&s;e in the yeare, that it may bee able to feed their Cattle, of which they haue thou&s;ands. For it is a kinde of gra&s;&s;e with a &s;talke, as big as a great wheaten reed, which hath a blade i&s;&s;uing from the top of it, on which, though the Cattle feed, yet it groweth euery day higher, vntill the top be too high for an Oxe to reach. Then th'inhabitants are wont put fire to it, for the &s;pace of fiue or &s;ixe miles together, which notwith|&s;tanding after it is thus burnt, within three dayes &s;pringeth vp fre&s;h like greene Corne.

<P>But after that we were come within a dayes journey of <HI>Panama,</HI> our Captaine vnder&s;tanding by the <HI>Syme|rons</HI> that the Dames of <HI>Panama</HI> are wont to &s;end forth Hunters, and Fowlers, for taking of &s;undry dainty Foule, which the Land yeeldeth, by whom if wee marched not very heedfully, wee might be de&s;cried; cau&s;ed all his company to march out of all ordinary way, and that with as great heed, &s;ilence and &s;ecrecy, as po&s;&s;ibly they might, to the Groue, which was a|greed on foure daies before, lying within a league of <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> where we might lye &s;afely vndi&s;couered nere the high way, that leadeth from thence to <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI></P>

<P>For they are wont to take their journey from <HI>Pana|ma</HI> to <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> which is &s;ixe leagues, euer by night, becau&s;e the Countrey is all champion, and con&s;e|quently by day very hot: but from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> to <HI>Nom|bre de Dios,</HI> as oft as they trauell by land with their Trea|&s;ure, they trauell alwayes by day and not by night, becau&s;e all that way is full of Woods, and there|fore very fre&s;h and coole: vnle&s;&s;e the <HI>Symerons</HI> happily encounter them, and make them &s;weate with feare, as &s;ometimes they haue done: whereupon they are glad to guard their <HI>Recoes</HI> with Souldiers as they pa&s;&s;e that way.</P>
<P>This la&s;t day our Captaine did behold and view, the mo&s;t of all that faire City, di&s;cerning the large &s;treete which lyeth directly from the Sea into the Land, South and North. By three of the clocke we came to this Groue, pa&s;&s;ing (for the more &s;ecrecy) along&s;t a certaine Riuer, which at that time was al|mo&s;t dryed vp.</P>
<P>Hauing di&s;po&s;ed of our &s;elues in the Groue, wee di&s;patched our Spye an houre before night, &s;o that by the clo&s;ing in of the euening, he might be in the City, as he was: whence pre&s;ently he returned vnto vs, that which very happily hee vnder&s;tood by companions of his: That the Trea&s;urer of <HI>Lima,</HI> in|tending to pa&s;&s;e into <HI>Spaine</HI> in the fir&s;t <HI>adui&s;o,</HI> (which
<PB N="62" REF="36">
was a Shippe of three hundred and fifty Tunne, a ve|ry good &s;ayler) was ready that night, to take his jour|ney towards <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> with his Daughter &amp; Fami|ly: hauing foureteene Moyles in company, of which, eight were loden with gold, and one with jewels And farther, that there were two other <HI>Recos,</HI> of fifty Moyles in each, loaden with victualles for the mo&s;t part, with &s;ome little quantity of &s;iluer, to come forth that night after the other. There are twenty eight of the&s;e <HI>Recas,</HI> the greate&s;t of them is of &s;eauenty Moyles, the le&s;&s;e of fifty, vnle&s;&s;e &s;ome particular man hire for him&s;elfe, tenne, twenty or thirty, as hee hath need.</P>
<P>Vpon this notice, wee forthwith marcht foure leagues; till we came within two leagues of <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> in which march two of our <HI>Symerons</HI> which were &s;ent before, by &s;cent of his match, found and brought a Spaniard, whome they had found a &s;leepe by the way, by &s;cent of the &s;aid match, and drawing neere thereby, heard him taking his breath as hee &s;lept; and being but one, they fell vpon him, &s;topt his mouth from crying, put out his match, and bound him &s;o, that they well neare &s;trangled him by that time hee was brought vnto vs. By examining him, we found all that to be true, which our Spye had reported to vs, and that he was a Souldier entertained with others by the Trea&s;urer, for the guard and conduct of this Trea&s;ure, from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI></P>
<P>This Souldier hauing learned who our Captaine was, tooke courage, and was bold to make two re|que&s;ts vnto him: the one, that hee would command his <HI>Symerons</HI> which hated the Spaniards (e&s;pecially the Souldiers) extreamely, to &s;pare his life, which hee
<PB N="63" REF="36">
doubted not but they would doe at his charge: the other was, that &s;eeing he was a Souldier, and a&s;&s;ured him, that they &s;hould haue that night, more gold, be&s;ides jewels, and Pearles of great price, then all they could cary (if not, then he was to be delt with hovv they vvould) but if they all found it &s;o, then it might plea&s;e our Captaine to giue vnto him, as much as might &s;uffice for him and his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e to liue vpon, as hee had heard our Captaine had done to diuers others: for which hee would make his name as famous, as any of them, which had receiued like fauour.</P>
<P>Being at the place appointed, our Captaine with halfe of his men, lay on one &s;ide of the way, about fifty paces off in the long gra&s;&s;e: <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> with the Captaine of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> and the other halfe, lay on the other &s;ide of the way, at the like di&s;tance: but &s;o farre behinde, that as occa&s;ion &s;erued, the former Company might take the formo&s;t Moyles by the heads, and the other the hindmo&s;t, becau&s;e the Moyles tyed together, are alwaies driuen one after another; and e&s;pecially that if wee &s;hould haue need to v&s;e our Weapons that night, we might be &s;ure not to enda|mage our fellowes. Wee had not laine thus in ambu&s;h much aboue an houre, but wee heard the <HI>Recos</HI> com|ming both from the City to <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> and from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> to the City, which hath a very common and great trade, when the Fleetes are there: wee heard them, by rea&s;on they delight much to haue deepe &s;oun|ding Belles, which in a &s;till night are heard very farre off.</P>
<P>Now though there vvere as great charge giuen as might be, that none of our men &s;hould &s;how or &s;tirre them&s;elues: but let all that came from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> to
<PB N="64" REF="37">
pa&s;&s;e quietly: yea their <HI>Recos</HI> al&s;o, becau&s;e wee knewe that they brought nothing but Marchandi&s;e from thence: yet one of our men called <HI>Robert Pike,</HI> hauing drunken too much <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> without water, forgat him&s;elfe, and enti&s;ing a <HI>Symeron</HI> forth with him, was gone hard to the way, with intent to haue &s;hewne his forwardne&s;&s;e on the foremo&s;t Moyles. And when a Caualier from <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> well mounted, with his Page running at his &s;tirrop, pa&s;t by, vnadui&s;edly he ro&s;e vp to &s;ee what he was: but the <HI>Symeron</HI> of bet|ter di&s;cretion puld him downe, and lay vpon him, that he might not di&s;couer them any more. Yet by this the Gentleman had taken notice by &s;eeing one all in white: for that wee had all put our &s;hirts ouer our other apparell, that wee might be &s;ure to knowe our owne men in the pell mell in the night. By meanes of this &s;ight, the Caualier putting &s;purs to his Hor&s;e, rode a fal&s;e gallop, as de&s;irous not onely him&s;elfe to be free of this doubt; which he imagined, but al&s;o to giue aduerti&s;ement to others that they might auoid it.</P>
<P>Our Captaine who had heard and ob&s;erued (by rea&s;on of the hardne&s;&s;e of the ground and &s;tilne&s;&s;e of the night) the change of this Gentlemans trot to a gallop, &s;u&s;pected, that he was di&s;couered, but could not imagine by who&s;e fault, neither did the time giue him lea&s;ure to &s;earch. And therefore con&s;idering that it might be, by rea&s;on of the danger of the place, well knowne to ordinary trauellers: wee lay &s;till in expecta|tion of the Trea&s;urers comming, who was by this time within halfe a league, and had come forwardes to vs, but that this Hor&s;eman meeting him, and (as we afterwards learned by the other <HI>Recoes</HI>) making re|port to him, what hee had &s;eene pre&s;ently that night,
<PB N="65" REF="37">
what hee heard of Captaine <HI>Drake</HI> this long time, and what hee conjectured to be mo&s;t likely: <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;aid Captaine <HI>Drake,</HI> or &s;ome for him, di&s;apointed of his expectation, of getting any great Trea&s;ure, both at <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and other places, was by &s;ome meanes or other come by land, in couert through the woods vnto this place to &s;peed of his purpo&s;e: and thereupon per&s;waded him to turne his <HI>Reco</HI> out of the way, &amp; let the other <HI>Recoes,</HI> which were comming after to pa&s;&s;e on. They were whole <HI>Recoes,</HI> and loaden but with victuals for the mo&s;t part, &s;o that the lo&s;&s;e of them were farre le&s;&s;e if the wor&s;t befell, and yet they &s;hould &s;erue to di&s;couer them as well as the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus by the rechle&s;ne&s;&s;e of one of our Company, and by the carefulne&s;&s;e of this Traueller, we were di&s;|appointed of a mo&s;t rich booty, which is to be thought God would not &s;hould be taken, for that by all like|lihood it was well gotten by that Trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>The other two <HI>Recoes</HI> were no &s;ooner come vp to vs, but being &s;tayed and &s;ea&s;ed on, one of the cheefe Carriers a very &s;en&s;ible fellow, told our Captaine by what meanes wee were di&s;couered, and coun&s;elled vs to &s;hift for our &s;elues betimes, vnle&s;&s;e vvee were able to encounter the whole force of the City and Coun|trey which before day would be about vs.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed vs but little, that vvee were defeated of our golden <HI>Recoe,</HI> and that in the&s;e we could finde not pa&s;t &s;ome two Hor&s;e-loade of &s;iluer: but it greeued our Captaine much more, that hee vvas di&s;couered, and that by one of his owne men. But knowing it bootle&s;&s;e to greeue at things pa&s;t, and hauing learned by experience, that all &s;afety in extremities con&s;i&s;teth in taking of time: after no long con&s;ultation with <HI>Pedro,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="38">
the cheefe of our <HI>Symerons,</HI> vvho declared that there vvere but two vvayes for him: the one to trauell backe againe the &s;ame &s;ecret way they came, for foure leagues &s;pace into the Woods: or el&s;e to march for|ward, by the high way to <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> being two lea|gues, and make a way vvith his Sword through the Enemies. Hee re&s;olued, con&s;idering the long and weary marches that vvee had taken, and cheefely that la&s;t euening and day before: to take now the &s;horte&s;t and readie&s;t vvay; as choo&s;ing rather to en|counter his Enemies vvhile hee had &s;trength remai|ning, then to bee encountred or cha&s;ed vvhen vvee &s;hould be worne out vvith vvearine&s;&s;e: principally novv hauing the Moyles, to ea&s;e them that vvould, &s;ome part of the vvay.</P>
<P>Therefore commanding all to refre&s;h them&s;elues moderatly vvith &s;uch &s;tore of victuall, as vve had there in aboundance: hee &s;ignified his re&s;olution and rea&s;on to them all: asking <HI>Pedro</HI> by name, vvhether hee vvould giue his hand not to for&s;ake him (becau&s;e hee knew that the re&s;t of the <HI>Symerons</HI> would al&s;o then &s;tand fa&s;t and firme, &s;o faithfull are they to their Captaine.) Hee being very glad of his re&s;olution, gaue our Cap|taine his hand, and vowed that hee vvould rather dye at his foote, then leaue him to the Enemies, if hee held this cour&s;e.</P>
<P>So hauing &s;trengthned our &s;elues for the time, vve tooke our journey towards <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> vvith helpe of the Moyles, till vvee came vvithin a mile of the Towne, vvhere vvee turned away the <HI>Recoes,</HI> charging the Conducters of them, not to follow vs, vpon paine of their liues.</P>
<P>There the vvay is cut through the Woods, about
<PB N="67" REF="38">
tenne or twelue foote broade, &s;o as two <HI>Recoes</HI> may pa&s;&s;e one by another. The fruitfulne&s;&s;e of the &s;oyle, cau&s;eth that vvith often &s;hredding &amp; ridding the vvay tho&s;e Woods grow as thicke as our hicke&s;t hedges in <HI>England</HI> that are oftne&s;t cut.</P>
<P>To the mid&s;t of this Wood, a Company of Soul|diers, vvhich continually lay in that Towne, to defend it again&s;t the <HI>Symerons</HI> vvere come forth, to &s;toppe vs if they might on the vvay, if not, to retrait to their &s;trength, and there to expect vs. A Conuent of Fryers of vvhome one vvas become a Leader, joyned vvith the&s;e Souldiers, to take &s;uch paete as they did.</P>
<P>Our Captaine vnder&s;tanding by our two <HI>Symerons,</HI> vvhich vvith great heedfulne&s;&s;e and &s;ilence, marched novv, but about halfe a flight-&s;hot before vs, that it was time for vs to arme &amp; take vs to our weapons, for they knew the Enemy vvas at hand, by &s;melling of their match and hearing of a noy&s;e: had giuen vs charge, that no one of vs &s;hould make any &s;hot, vntill the Spaniards had fir&s;t &s;pent their volly vvhich he thought they vvould not doe before they had &s;poken, as indeed fell out: For as &s;oone as vve vvere vvithin hearing, a Spani&s;h Captaine cryed aloud, H&oacute;&oacute;, our Captaine an&s;wered him likevvi&s;e, &amp; being aemanded, <HI>Que gente?</HI> replyed <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> But vvhen the &s;aid Commander charged him in the name of the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> his Ma|&s;ter, that wee &s;hould yeeld our &s;elues, promi&s;ing in the word and faith of a Gentleman Souldier, that if we would &s;o doe, he would v&s;e vs with all curte&s;ie; our Captaine drawing &s;omwhat neere him &s;aid: That for the honour of the Queene of <HI>England</HI> his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, hee mu&s;t haue pa&s;&s;age that way: and therewithall di&s;char|ged his Pi&s;toll towards him.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="39">Vpon this, they pre&s;ently &s;hot off their whole vol|ly, which, though it lightly wounded our Captaine and diuers of our men, yet it cau&s;ed death to one onely of our Company called <HI>Iohn Harris,</HI> who was &s;o poudered with haile-&s;hot (which they all v&s;ed for the mo&s;t part as it &s;eemed, or el&s;e quartered, for that our men were hurt with that kinde) that we could not recouer his life, though he continued all that day afterwards with vs. Pre&s;ently as our Captaine percei|ued their &s;hott to come &s;lacking, as the latter drops of a great &s;hewre of raine, with his Whi&s;tle he gaue vs his v&s;uall &s;ignall, to an&s;were them with our &s;hot and Arrowes, and &s;o march onwards vpon the Enemy, with intent to come to handi-&s;trokes, and to haue joy|ned with them: whom when hee found retired as to a place of &s;ome better &s;trength, hee encrea&s;ed his pace to preuent them if he might. Which the <HI>Symerons</HI> perceiuing, although by terror of the &s;hot continuing, they were for the time &s;tept a &s;ide: yet as &s;oone as they di&s;cerned by hearing that we marched onward, they all ru&s;ht forwards one after another, trauer&s;ing the way, vvith their Arrowes ready in their Bowes, and their manner of Countrey dance or leape, very lu&s;ti|ly, &s;inging <HI>Y&oacute; peh&oacute;, y&oacute; peh&oacute;,</HI> and &s;o got before vs, where they continued their leape and &s;ong, after the manner of their owne Countrey warres, till they and wee ouer-tooke &s;ome of the Enemy, who neere the Townes end, had conueyed them&s;elues within the Woods, to haue taken their &s;tand at vs, as be|fore.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Symerons</HI> now throughly encouraged, when they &s;awe our re&s;olution, brake in through the thic|kets, on both &s;ides of them, forcing them to flye,
<PB N="69" REF="39">
Fryers and all, although diuers of our men were woun|ded, and one <HI>Symeron</HI> e&s;pecially was runne through with one of their Pikes, who&s;e courage and minde &s;erued him &s;o well notwith&s;tanding, that hee reuen|ged his owne death ere hee dyed, by killing him that had giuen him that deadly wound.</P>
<P>Wee, with all &s;peed, following this cha&s;e, en|tred the Towne of <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> being of about forty or fifty hou&s;es, which had both a Gouernour and other Officers and &s;ome faire hou&s;es, with many Store-hou&s;es large and &s;trong for the Wares, which were brought thither from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> by the Riuer of <HI>Chagro,</HI> &s;o to be tran&s;ported by Moyles to <HI>Panama:</HI> be&s;ides the Mona&s;terie where wee found aboue a thou&s;and Bulles and Pardons newly &s;ent thither from Rome.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e hou&s;es wee found three Gentlewomen, which had lately beene deliuered of Children there, though their dwelling were in <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> becau&s;e it hath beene ob&s;erued of long time, as they reported to vs, that no <HI>Spaniard</HI> or White woman could euer bee deliuered in <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> with &s;afety of their Children, but that within two or three dayes they di|ed; notwith&s;tanding that being borne and brought vp in this <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> or <HI>Panama</HI> fiue or &s;ixe yeares, and then brought to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> if they e&s;caped &s;icknes the fir&s;t or &s;econd month, they commonly liued in it as healthily as in any other place: although no &s;tranger (as they &s;ay) can endure there any long time, without great danger of death or extreame &s;icknes.</P>
<P>Though at our fir&s;t comming into the Towne with Armes &s;o &s;uddenly, the&s;e Gentlewomen were in great feare: yet becau&s;e our Captaine had giuen &s;trait charge
<PB N="70" REF="40">
to all the <HI>Symerons</HI> (that while they were in his com|pany, they &s;hould neuer hurt any woman, nor man that had not weapon in his hand to doe them hurt, which they erne&s;tly promi&s;ed, and no le&s;&s;e faith|fully performed) they had no wrong offered them, nor any thing taken from them, to the worth of a gar|ter: wherein, albeit they had indeed &s;ufficient &s;afety and &s;ecurity, by tho&s;e of his company, which our Captaine &s;ent vnto them, of purpo&s;e to comfort them: yet they neuer cea&s;ed mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreating, that our Captaine would vouch&s;afe to come to them him&s;elfe for their more &s;afety: which when hee did, in their pre&s;ence reporting the charge hee had fir&s;t giuen, &amp; th'a&s;&s;urance of his men, they were comforted.</P>
<P>While the Guards which wee had (not without great need) &s;ett, a&s;well on the bridge which wee were to pa&s;&s;e ouer, as at the Townes end where wee entred (they haue no other entrance into the Towne by Land: but from the waters &s;ide there is one other, to carry vp and downe their Marchandi&s;e from their Fregates) gained vs liberty and quiet to &s;tay in this Towne &s;ome houre and halfe: wee had not onely re|fre&s;hed our &s;elues, but our company and <HI>Symerons</HI> had gotten &s;ome good pillage, which our Captaine allowed and gaue them (being not the thing he looked for) &s;o that it were not too comber&s;ome or heauy in re&s;pect of our trauell, or defence of our &s;elues. A little before wee departed, &s;ome ten or tvvelue hor&s;emen came from <HI>Panama</HI> by all likelihood, &s;uppo&s;inge that wee were gone out of this Towne, for that all was &s;o &s;till and quiet, came to enter the Towne confidently: but finding their entertainement &s;uch as it was, they that could, rode fa&s;ter backe againe for
<PB N="71" REF="40">
feare, then they had ridden forwards for hope.</P>
<P>Thus wee hauing ended our bu&s;ines in this Towne, and the day beginning to &s;pring, wee marched ouer the Bridge, ob&s;eruing the &s;ame order that wee did be|fore. There wee were all &s;afe in our opinion, as if wee had beene enuironed with Wall and Trench: for that no <HI>Spaniard</HI> without his extreame danger could follow vs. The rather now, for that our <HI>Symerons</HI> were growne very valiant. But our Captaine con&s;i|dering that hee had a long way to pa&s;&s;e, and that hee had beene now well neere fortnight from his Ship, where hee had left his Company but weake by rea|&s;on of their &s;icknes, ha&s;tned his jorneys a&s;much as he might, refu&s;ing to vi&s;it the other <HI>Symeron</HI> Townes (which they earne&s;tly de&s;ired him) and encouraging his owne Company with &s;uch example and &s;peech that the way &s;eemed much &s;horter. For hee marched mo&s;t cheerefully and a&s;&s;ured vs, that hee doubted not but ere hee left that Coa&s;t, wee &s;hould all bee bountifully payd and recompen&s;ed for all tho&s;e paines taken: but by rea&s;on of this our Captaines ha&s;te, and leauing of their Townes, wee marched many dayes with hungry &s;tomackes, much again&s;t the will of our <HI>Symerons</HI>: who if wee would haue &s;tayed any day from this continuall journeying, would haue killed for vs victuall &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In our ab&s;ence, the re&s;t of the <HI>Symerons</HI> had built a little Towne within three leagues off the port where our Ship lay. There our Captaine was contented, vppon their great and earne&s;t intreaties to make &s;ome &s;tay, for that they alleaged, it was onely built for his &s;ake. And indeed hee con&s;ented the rather, that the want of &s;hooes might bee &s;upplyed by meanes of the

<HI>Symerons,</HI> who were a great helpe vnto vs: all our men complayning of the tendernes of their feete, whom our Captaine would him&s;elfe in their complaint ac|company &s;omtimes without cau&s;e, but &s;ometimes with cau&s;e indeed, which made the re&s;t to beare the burthen the more ea&s;ily.</P>

A&s;&s;oone as this me&s;&s;enger was come to the &s;hoare, calling to our Ship, as bringing &s;ome newes, hee was quickly &s;ett aboord, by tho&s;e which longed to heare of our Captaines &s;peeding: but when hee &s;hewed the tooth-pike of gold, which hee &s;aid our Captaine had &s;ent for a token to <HI>Edward Hixom,</HI> with charge to meete him at &s;uch a Riuer: though the Ma&s;ter knew well the Captaines Tooth-pike: yet by rea&s;on of his ad|monition

and caueat giuen him at parting, hee (though he bewrayed no &s;igne of di&s;tru&s;ting the <HI>Sy|meron</HI>) yet &s;tood as amazed, lea&s;t &s;omething had befallen our Captaine otherwi&s;e then well. The <HI>Symeron</HI> perceiuing this, tolde him, that it was night when hee was &s;ent away, &s;o that our Captaine could not &s;end any letter, but yet with the point of his knife, hee wrote &s;omething vpon the Tooth-pike, which (hee &s;aid) &s;hould be &s;ufficient to gaine cre|dit to the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Ma&s;ter lookt vpon it, and &s;awe written <HI>By me Francis Drake,</HI> wherefore hee beleiued, and according to the me&s;&s;age, prepared what pro|ui&s;ion hee could, and repaired to the mouth of the Riuer of <HI>Tortugos,</HI> as the <HI>Symerons</HI> that went with him then named it.</P>
<P>That after noone towards three a clocke, we were come downe to that Riuer, not pa&s;t halfe an houre, be|fore wee &s;awe our Pinnace ready come to receiue vs: which was vnto vs all a double reioycing: fir&s;t that wee &s;awe them, and next &s;o &s;oone: our Captaine with all our Company prai&s;ed God mo&s;t hartily, for that wee &s;awe our Pinnace and fellowes againe.</P>
<P>We all &s;eemed to the&s;e who had liued at re&s;t and plenty all this while aboard, as men &s;trangely chang|ed (our Captaine yet not much changed) in counte|nance and plight: and indeed our long fa&s;ting and &s;ore trauell might &s;omewhat fore-pine and wa&s;te vs: but the greefe wee drew inwardly, for that wee re|turned without that Gold and Trea&s;ure wee hoped for, did no doubt &s;hewe her print and foote&s;teps in our faces.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of our men which were then mi&s;&s;ed, could

<P>Thus being returned from <HI>Panama,</HI> to the great reioycing of our Company, who were throughly re|uiued with the report wee brought from thence: e&s;|pecially vnder&s;tanding our Captaines purpo&s;e, that he meant not to leaue off thus, but would once a|gaine attempt the &s;ame journey, whereof they al&s;o might bee partakers: our Captaine would not in the meane time &s;uffer this edge and forwardnes of his men to bee dulled or rebated, by lying &s;till idly vnim|ployed, as knowing right well by continuall experi|ences, that no &s;icknes was more noy&s;ome to impeach any enterpri&s;e then delay and idlenes.</P>
<P>Therefore con&s;idering deepely the intelligences of other places of importance thereabouts, which hee had gotten the former yeares: and particularly of <HI>Veragua,</HI> a rich Tovvne lying to the We&s;tvard, be|tvveene <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> vvhere is the riche&s;t Mine of fine Gold, that is on this North &s;ide: hee con&s;ulted with his company touching their opinions, what was to bee done in this meane time, and how they &s;tood affected? Some thought, that it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eeke &s;upply of victuals, that wee might the better bee able to keepe our men clo&s;e and in health till our time came: and this was ea&s;y to bee compa&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e the Fregates with victuall went without great defence, whereas the Fregates and Barkes with Trea&s;ure, for the mo&s;t part were vvaft|ed vvith great Ships and &s;tore of Souldiers. Others yet iudged, vvee might better be&s;towe our time in

intercepting the Fregates of Trea&s;ure: fir&s;t for that our Maga&s;ines and Storehou&s;es of victuall were rea|&s;onably furni&s;hed, and the Country it &s;elfe was &s;o plentifull, that euery man might prouide for him&s;elfe if the wor&s;t befell: and victuall might hereafter bee prouided abundantly a&s;well as now: whereas the Trea&s;ure neuer floateth vpon the Sea, &s;o ordinarily as at this time, of the Fleets being there, which time in no wi&s;e may bee neglected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Symerons</HI> being demanded al&s;o their opinion, for that they were experienced in the particularities of all the Townes thereabouts, as in which, &s;ome or other of them had &s;erued: declared that by <HI>Veragua Sinnior Pezoro</HI> &s;ometime their Ma&s;ter from whome they fled, dwelt not in the Towne for feare of &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, but yet not farre off from the Towne, for his better releefe: in a very &s;trong hou&s;e of &s;tone, where hee had dwelt ninteene yeares at lea&s;t, neuer trauelling from home, vnle&s;&s;e happily once a yeare to <HI>Carthagene</HI> or <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> when the Fleets were there: hee keepeth a hundred &s;laues at lea&s;t in the Mines, each &s;laue being bound to bring in dayly cleere gaine (all charges deductted) three Pezos of Gold for him&s;elfe and two for his women (eight &s;hillings three pence the Pezo) amounting in the whole, to about two hundred pound &s;terling each day: &s;o that hee hath heaped a mighty Ma&s;&s;e of Trea&s;ure together, which hee keepeth in certaine great Che&s;ts of two foote deepe three broad, and foure long: being, notwith&s;tanding all his wealth, hard and cruell, not onely to his &s;laues, but vnto all men, and therefore neuer going abroad, but with a Guard of fiue or &s;ixe men to defend his per&s;on from danger,
<PB N="76" REF="43">
which hee feareth extraordinarily from all creatures. And as touching meanes of compa&s;&s;ing this purpo&s;e, they woulde conduct him &s;afely through the woods, by the &s;ame wayes by which they fled, that hee &s;hould not need to enter their Hauens with danger, but might come vpon their backes altogether vnlooked for. And though his hou&s;e were of &s;tone &s;o that it could not bee burnt, yet if our Captaine would vn|dertake th'attempt, they would vndermine and ouer|throwe, or otherwi&s;e breake it open, in &s;uch &s;ort, as wee might haue ea&s;y acce&s;&s;e to his greate&s;t Trea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our Captaine hauing heard all their opinions, concluded &s;o; that by deuiding his Company the two fir&s;t different &s;entences, were both reconciled, both to bee practi&s;ed and put in vre. <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> appointed in the <HI>Beare,</HI> to bee &s;ent E&s;twards towards <HI>Tolow,</HI> to &s;ee what &s;tore of victuals would come a|thwart his halfe, &amp; him&s;elfe would to the We&s;tward in the <HI>Minian,</HI> lye off and on the <HI>Cabezas,</HI> where was the greate&s;t trade and mo&s;t ordinary pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e which tran&s;ported Trea&s;ure from <HI>Veragua</HI> and <HI>Nicara|gua</HI> to the Fleet: &s;o that no time might bee lo&s;t, nor opportunity let &s;lip either for victuall or Trea&s;ure. As for th'attempt of <HI>Veragua</HI> or <HI>Sinior Peroros</HI> hou&s;e by land, by marching through the woods, hee li|ked not off, lea&s;t it might ouer weary his men by con|tinuall labor, whom he &s;tudied to refre&s;h and &s;trength|en, for his next &s;reuice forenamed.</P>
<P>Therefore v&s;ing our <HI>Symerons</HI> mo&s;t curteou&s;ly, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing tho&s;e that were de&s;irous to their wiues, with &s;uch gifts and fauors as were mo&s;t plea&s;ing, and entertaining tho&s;e &s;till aboord his Ships, which

were contented to abide with the Company remai|ning, the Pinnaces departed as was determined, the <HI>Minion</HI> to the We&s;t, the <HI>Beare</HI> to the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minion</HI> about the <HI>Cabe&ccedil;as</HI> met with a Fregate of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> in which was &s;ome gold, and a <HI>Geno|way</HI> Pilot, of which Nation there are many in tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, which had beene at <HI>Veragua</HI> not pa&s;t eight dayes before, he being very well entreated, certi|fied our Captaine of the State of the Towne, and of the Harbor, and of a Fregate that was there ready to come forth within fewe dayes, aboard which there was aboue a million of Gold, offering to conduct him to it, if wee would doe him his right, for that he knew the channell very perfectly, &s;o that hee could enter by night &s;afely without danger of the &s;ands and &s;hallowes, (though there be but little water) and vtterly vnde&s;cryed, for that the Towne is fiue leagues within the Harbor, and the way by land is &s;o farre about and difficult through the Woods, that though wee &s;hould by any ca&s;ualty be di&s;coue|red, about the point of the Harbor, yet wee might di&s;patch our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e and depart, before the Towne could haue notice of our comming. At his being there hee perceiued they had heard of <HI>Drakes</HI> being on the Coa&s;t, which had put them in great feare, as in all other places (<HI>Pezoro</HI> purpo&s;ing to remoue him|&s;elfe to the South Sea) but there was nothing done to preuent him, their feare being &s;o great, that, as it is accu&s;tomed in &s;uch ca&s;es, it excluded Coun&s;ell and bred di&s;paire.</P>
<P>Our Captaine conferring with his owne know|ledge and former intelligences, was purpo&s;ed to haue returned to his Shippe, to haue taken &s;ome
<PB N="78" REF="44">
of tho&s;e <HI>Symero~s</HI> which had dwelt with <HI>Sinior Pezoro,</HI> to be the more confirmed in this point. But when the <HI>Ge|noway</HI> Pilot was very earne&s;t, to haue the time gai|ned, and warranted our Captaine of good &s;peed, if wee delayd not, he dimi&s;&s;ed the Fregate &s;omewhat lighter to, ha&s;ten her journey, and with this Pilots ad|ui&s;e, laboured with &s;ayle and oares to get this Harbor and to enter it by night accorcordingly, con&s;idering that this Fregate might now bee gained, and <HI>Pezoros</HI> hou&s;e attempted hereafter notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But when wee were come to the mouth of the Har|bor, we heard the report of two Chambers, and far|ther off about a league within the Bay, two other as it were an&s;wering them: whereby our <HI>Geno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ai&s;e</HI> Pilot coniectured that we were di&s;couered: for hee a&s;&s;ured vs, that this order had beene taken, &s;ince his la&s;t be|ing there; by rea&s;on of the aduerti&s;ement and charge, which the Gouernour of <HI>Panama</HI> had &s;ent vnto all the Coa&s;t, which euen in their beds lay in great and con|tinuall feare of our Captaine, and therefore by all likely-hood, maintained this kinde of watch, at the charge of the rich Gnuffe <HI>Pezoro,</HI> for their &s;ecu|rity.</P>
<P>Thus being defeated of this expectation, wee found that it was not Gods will that wee &s;hould en|ter at that time: the rather for that the winde, which had all this time beene Ea&s;terly, came vp to the We&s;tward, and inuited vs to returne againe to our Shippe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 19.</NOTE> where on Sheere Thur&s;day wee met accor|ding to appointment with our <HI>Beare,</HI> and found that &s;hee had be&s;towed her time to more profit then wee had done.</P>
<P>For &s;hee had taken a Fregate in which there

were tenne men, whome they &s;et a&s;hoare; great &s;tore of <HI>Maiz,</HI> twenty eight fat Hogs, and two hundred Hens. Our Captaine di&s;charged this Fregate of her lading, and becau&s;e &s;he was new,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 20.</NOTE> &s;trong and of a good mould, the next day hee tallowed her to make her a Man of warre: di&s;po&s;ing all our Ordinance and proui&s;ions that were fit for &s;uch v&s;e in her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 21.</NOTE> For we had heard by the Spaniards la&s;t taken, that there were two little Gallies built in <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> to waft the <HI>Chagro</HI> Fleete to and froe, but were not yet both lanched: wherefore hee purpo&s;ed now to aduenture for that Fleete.

<P>The next day with the new tallowed Fregate of <HI>Tolow</HI> and his <HI>Beare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">March 23.</NOTE> wee &s;et &s;ayle towards the <HI>Cati|ua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> where about two dayes after wee landed, and &s;tayed till noone: at what time &s;eeing a &s;ayle to the We&s;twards, as wee deemed making to the Iland: wee &s;et &s;ayle and plyed towards him, who de&s;cry|ing vs, bare vvith vs, till hee perceiued by our con|fidence, that wee were no Spaniards, and conje|ctured that wee were tho&s;e Engli&s;hmen, of whome hee had heard long before.

<P>Wee vnder&s;tood that hee was <HI>Tet&uacute;</HI> a French Captaine of <HI>New-hauen,</HI> a Man of warre as wee were: de&s;irous to be releeued by vs. For at our fir&s;t mee|ting the French Captaine ca&s;t abroad his hands, and prayed our Captaine to helpe him to &s;ome wa|ter,

for that hee had nothing but Wine, and Cider aboard him, which had brought his men into great &s;ickene&s;&s;e.

Indeed hee had &s;eauenty men, and wee now but thirty one: his Ship was aboue eighty Tunne, and our Fregate not pa&s;t twenty, our Pinnace nothing neere tenne Tunne: yet our Captaine thought this proportionable, in con&s;i|deration that not number of men, but quality of their judgements and knowledge, were to bee the princi|pall actors herein: and the French Shippe could doe no &s;eruice, nor &s;tand in any &s;teed to this enterpri&s;e which we intended, and had agreed vpon long before, both touching the time when it &s;hould take begin|ning, and the place where wee &s;hould meet, namely at <HI>Rio Franci&s;co.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e three Recoes were guarded with forty fiue Souldiers or their abouts, fifteene to each Reco, which cau&s;ed &s;ome exchange of Ballets and Arrowes for a time, in which conflict the French Captaine was &s;ore wounded with hayle-&s;hot in the belly, and one <HI>Symeron</HI> &s;laine: but in the end the&s;e Souldiers thought it the be&s;t way to leaue their Moyles with vs, and to &s;eeke for more helpe abroad: in which meane time wee tooke &s;ome paine to ea&s;e &s;ome of the Moyles, which were heauie&s;t loaden of their cariages. And be|cau&s;e wee our &s;elues were &s;omewhat weary, wee were contented with a few barres and quoits of gold, as wee could well cary: burying about fifteene Tunne of &s;iluer, partly in the boroughs which the great Land|crabs had made in the earth, and partly vnder old Trees which were fallen thereabout, and partly in the &s;and and grauell of a Riuer, not very deepe of water.</P>

<P>Our Captaine &s;eeing the Shallops, feared lea&s;t hauing taken our Pinnaces, they had compelled our men by torture, to confe&s;&s;e where his Fregate and Ships were.

Let vs therefore make a Raft with the Trees that are here in readines, as offe|ring them&s;elues being brought downe the Riuer, hap|pily this la&s;t &s;torme, and put our &s;elues to Sea. I

<P>At his departure hee comforted the Company, by promi&s;ing, that if it plea&s;ed God, hee &s;hould put his foote in &s;afety aboard his Fregate, hee would, God willing, by one means or other get them all aboard, in de&s;pite of all the <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">iards</HI> in the Indies</P>

But hee willing to ridd all doubts, and fill them with ioy, tooke out of his bo&s;ome a Quoit of Gold, thanking God that our voyage was made. And to the Frenchmen hee declared, how their Captaine in|deed was left behinde, &s;ore wounded and two of his Company with him: but it &s;hould bee no hin|drance to them.</P>
<P>That night our Captaine with great paine of his Company, rowed to <HI>Roo Faanci&s;co:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 4.</NOTE> where hee tooke the re&s;t in, and the Trea&s;ure which wee had brought with vs: making &s;uch expedition, that by dawning of the day, we &s;et &s;ayle backe againe, to our Fre|gate, and from thence directly to our Ships: where a&s;&s;oone as wee arriued, our Captaine deuided by weight, the Gold and Siluer into two euen por|tions, betwene the French, and the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>In the meane time our Captaine made a &s;ecret com|po&s;ition with the <HI>Symerons,</HI> that twelue of our men and &s;ixteene of theirs, &s;hould make another voyage, to get intelligence in what ca&s;e the Country &s;tood, and if it might be, recouer Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tort&uacute;</HI> the French Captaine, at lea&s;t-wi&s;e to bring away that which was hidden in our former &s;urprize and could not then bee conueniently caried.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> and <HI>Thomas Sherwell</HI> were put in tru&s;t for this &s;eruice, to the great content of the whole Company, who conceiued greate&s;t hope of them next our Captaine, whome by no meanes they would condi&s;cend to &s;uffer to aduenture againe this time: yet hee him&s;elfe rowed to &s;et them a&s;hore at <HI>Rio Franci&s;co:</HI> finding his labor well imployed both other|wi&s;e, and al&s;o in &s;auing one of tho&s;e two French|men that had remained willingly to accompany their wounded Captaine.</P>

<P>This report notwith&s;tanding, our purpo&s;e held, and our men were &s;ent to the &s;aid place, where they found that the earth, euery way a mile di&s;tant had beene digged and turned vp in euery place of any like|lihood, to haue any thing hidden in it. And yet ne|uerthele&s;&s;e, for all that narrow &s;earch, all our mens labour was not quite lo&s;t: but &s;o con&s;idered, that the third day after their departure, they all returned &s;afe and cheerefull, with as much &s;iluer as they and all the <HI>Symerons</HI> could finde, (<HI>viz:</HI> thirteene barres of &s;iluer, and &s;ome fewe quoits of gold) with which they were pre&s;ently embarqued without empeachment, repai|ring with no le&s;&s;e &s;peed then joy to our Fregate.</P>
<P>Now was it high time to thinke of homewards, hauing &s;ped our &s;elues as wee de&s;ired: and therefore our Captaine concluded to vi&s;it <HI>Rio grand,</HI> once againe, to &s;ee if he could meet with any &s;ufficient Ship or Bark, to cary victuall enough to &s;erue our turne home|wards, in which wee might in &s;afety and &s;ecurity em|barque our &s;elues.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="50">The French-men hauing formerly gone from vs as &s;oone as they had their &s;hares at our fir&s;t returne with the Trea&s;ure, as being very de&s;irous to returne home into their Countrey, and our Captaine as de|&s;irous to di&s;mi&s;&s;e them, as they were to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; for that hee fore&s;awe they could not in their Shippe auoid the danger of being taken by the Spaniards, if they &s;hould make out any Men of warre for them, while they lingred on the Coa&s;t, and hauing al&s;o beene then againe releeued with victuals by vs: Now at our meeting of them againe, were very loath to leaue vs, and therefore accompanied vs very kinde|ly as farre vp as Saint <HI>Barnards,</HI> and farther would, but that they dur&s;t not aduenture &s;o great danger, for that wee had intelligence, that the Fleete was ready to &s;et &s;ayle for <HI>Spaine,</HI> riding at the entry of <HI>Carthagena.</HI></P>
<P>Thus wee departed from them, pa&s;&s;ing hard by <HI>Carthagena,</HI> in the &s;ight of all the Fleete, with a Flagge of Saint <HI>George</HI> in the maine top of our Fregate, with &s;ilke &s;treamers and ancients downe to the water, &s;ayling forward with a large winde, till wee came within two leagues of the Riuer, being all lowe land, and darke night: where to preuent the ouer-&s;hooting of the Riuer in the night, we lay off &amp; on bearing &s;mall &s;ayle, till that about mid-night the winde vee|ring to the Ea&s;tward, by two of the clocke in the morning, a Fregate from <HI>Rio grand</HI> pa&s;&s;ed hard by vs, bearing al&s;o but &s;mall &s;ayle.

And being at anchor, pre&s;ently wee houe out all the Maizaland, &s;auing three Buts which we kept for our &s;tore: and carying all our proui&s;ions a &s;hoare, wee brought both our Fregates on the <HI>Ca|rine,</HI> and new tallowed them.</P>
<P>Here wee &s;tayed about &s;eauenight, trimming and rigging our Fregates, boarding and &s;towing our pro|ui&s;ions, tearing abroad and burning our Pinnaces, that the <HI>Symerons</HI> might haue the yron-worke.</P>
<P>About a day or two before our departure, our Captaine willed <HI>Pedro</HI> and three of the cheefe&s;t of the <HI>Symerons</HI> to goe through both his Fregates, to &s;ee what they liked, promi&s;ing to giue it them what&s;oeuer it were, &s;o it were not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as that hee could not returne into <HI>England</HI> without it. And for their wifes hee would him&s;elfe &s;eeke out &s;ome &s;ilkes or lin|nen that might gratifie them: which while hee was choo&s;ing out of his Trunckes, the Cymeter which Captaine <HI>Tet&uacute;</HI> had giuen to our Captaine, chanced to be taken forth in <HI>Pedros</HI> &s;ight, which hee &s;eeing grew &s;o much in liking thereof, that hee accounted of no|thing el&s;e in re&s;pect of it, and preferred it before all that could be giuen him: yet imagining, that it was no le&s;&s;e e&s;teemed of our Captaine, dur&s;t not him&s;elfe open his mouth to craue or commend it: but made one <HI>Francis Tucker</HI> to be his meane to breake his minde, pro|mi&s;ing to giue him a fine quoit of gold, which yet hee

had in &s;tore, if he would but moue our Captaine for it; and to our Captaine him&s;elfe, hee would giue foure other great quoits, which hee had hidden, intending to haue re&s;erued them till another voyage.</P>
<P>Our Captaine being accordingly moued by <HI>Francis Tucker,</HI> could haue beene content to haue made no &s;uch exchange, but yet de&s;irous to content him, that had de&s;erued &s;o well, hee gaue it him with many good words, who receiued it with no little joy, affirming that if hee &s;hould giue his wife and children (which hee loued dearely) in liew of it, hee could not &s;uffi|ciently recompence it, (for hee would pre&s;ent his King with it, who hee knew would make him a great man, euen for this very guifts &s;ake) yet in gratuity and &s;teed of other requitall of this jewell, hee de|&s;ired our Captaine to accept the&s;e foure peeces of gold, as a token of his thankefulne&s;&s;e to him, and a pawne of his faithfulne&s;&s;e during life.</P>
<P>Our Captaine receiued it in mo&s;t kinde &s;ort, but tooke it not to his own benefit, but cau&s;ed it to be ca&s;t into the whole aduenture, &s;aying, if hee had not beene &s;et forth to that place, he had not attained &s;uch a commoditie, and therefore it was ju&s;t that they which bare part with him of his burthen in &s;etting him to Sea, &s;hould enjoy the proportion of his benefit what&s;oeuer at his returne.</P>
