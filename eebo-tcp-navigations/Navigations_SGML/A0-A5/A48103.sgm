<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COnform to your De&s;ire, and mine own Promi&s;e: I have &s;ent You the following De&s;cription of <HI>Darian;</HI> I was up the Country when the two Gentlemen went for <HI>Scotland</HI> who brought the News of our arrival: but having now an Occa&s;ion I have &s;ent you the following Account.</P>
<P>You de&s;ired a particular Account of the &s;aid <HI>Darian,</HI> long &s;ince, And according to your De&s;ire, I have &s;ent a particular Account of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Ground, Animals, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Trees;</HI> and what <HI>Minerals</HI> they have, with a Draught of the Place, The <HI>Habits</HI> of their <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Queens,</HI> The <HI>Form</HI> of their <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> The <HI>Way</HI> of their <HI>Fighting</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other Enemies.</P>
<P>Since our &s;afe Arrival We have vieued, tran&s;ver&s;'d, and gone about near an hundered Miles in the Country formerly called <HI>Darian:</HI> but We have named it <HI>CALEDONIA,</HI> and there is a Fort very conveniently built, which We call <HI>New-EDINB&V;RGH.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darian</HI> is &s;ituated in the <HI>Main-Land</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>America,</HI> on the North of the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> 8 <HI>degr.</HI> 11 <HI>min. Latitude;</HI> The Land is narrower from the <HI>North</HI> to
<PB N="4" REF="3">the <HI>South</HI> Sea, which you will &s;ee by the <HI>Mapp:</HI> As for the great <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Darian,</HI> it is &s;ituated &s;omething to the <HI>Ea&s;t|ward</HI> ot the <HI>Golden I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>The golden I&s;land is but a &s;mall place, not much bigger than <HI>Inch-Keith</HI> in the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great many I&s;lands we&s;tward from the golden I&s;land 14. <HI>Leagues</HI> called <HI>Zanblas</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Situation of our <HI>Fort</HI> does ly very conveniently, ha|ving a <HI>Bay</HI> upon the <HI>West,</HI> with many &s;mall <HI>Rocks,</HI> which make it inacce&s;&s;able; On the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> the great River of <HI>Darian.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is as good here, as in any other place in <HI>America;</HI> up the Country there are long Ranges of <HI>Mountains,</HI> well cloathed with <HI>Trees,</HI> which for the mo&s;t part are <HI>Palm,</HI> and <HI>Yellow-Sanders;</HI> The Inhabitants call it <HI>Bois de Chandle,</HI> or in Engli&s;h <HI>Candle-Wood;</HI> It burns like a Candle, and &s;erves them with Light while they fi&s;h in the Night time. Here grows al&s;o <HI>Lignum &s;anctum,</HI> or <HI>Guiacum,</HI> its Virtues are very well known, more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who ob&s;erve not well the VII. Commandment, and are giv'n to impure Copula|tions; Phy&s;icians drawing hence in &s;everall Compo&s;itions the greate&s;t Antidote again&s;t all venerall De&s;ea&s;es, as al&s;o for cold and vitious Humors.</P>
<P>The Tree likewi&s;e that affords <HI>Gummi Elemi</HI> grows here in great Aboundance; As doth <HI>Radix Chinae,</HI> or <HI>China-Root;</HI></P>
<P>There is a <HI>Prickle Palm,</HI> &s;o call'd becau&s;e it is infinitly full of <HI>Prickles</HI> from the <HI>Root</HI> to the <HI>Leaves;</HI> with the&s;e Prickles the <HI>Indians</HI> u&s;e to torment the Pri&s;oners they take in Battle, they tye them to a Tree, then takeing the&s;e Thorns they put them into little Pellets of Cotton dipt in Oil, and &s;tick them
<PB N="5" REF="3">in the Sides of the mi&s;erable pri&s;oners, as thick as the Bri|&s;tles of an <HI>Hedg-Hogg:</HI> which cau&s;e an incredible Torment to the Patient; Then they &s;et them a Fire, and if the tor|mented Pri&s;oner &s;ing in the Mid&s;t of his Torments: He is e|&s;teem'd a couragious Soldier, who neither fears his Enemies nor the Torture; But if on the contrary, He cry out, they e|&s;teem him a Coward, and unworthy of any Memory. This Cu&s;tom was told me by an <HI>Indian,</HI> who &s;aid He had u&s;ed his Enemy thus, oftentimes. But to return to the <HI>Prickle-Palm,</HI> I &s;hall only tell you that the&s;e Palm Trees in this only differ from the ordinary <HI>Palms,</HI> The <HI>Leaves</HI> are like the&s;e of other <HI>Palm</HI> Trees, only a little bigger, and rounder, and full of little <HI>Kernels,</HI> as plea&s;eing to the Ta&s;te as the <HI>Walnuts</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Wine-Palm</HI> is &s;o call'd from the Aboundance of Wine gathered from it, of an extraordinary Shape or Form for from the <HI>Root</HI> up half Way, it is only three or four In|ches thick; but upward, &s;omething above two thirds of its Height; It is as big, and as thick, as an ordinary Bucket, &amp; within it is full of a certain Matter very like a &s;lender Stock of white <HI>Cabbage,</HI> which is a very juicy of a Liquor much plea&s;ing to the Palate; This Liquor after Fermentation and Settling of the Grounds, becomes very good and clear Wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fruit</HI> is much like to that of other <HI>Palms,</HI> but &s;maller, like <HI>Cherries;</HI> To write farther of the Trees, it would fill a great many Sheets; But I will only name them: <HI>Palm a Chapelet,</HI> or <HI>Ro&s;ary-Palm,</HI> &s;o called by the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Spa|niards; Caremit-Tree,</HI> very like our <HI>Pear-Tree,</HI> very plea&s;ing to the Ta&s;te; <HI>Genpa-Trees,</HI> like to our <HI>Cherry Trees;</HI> be&s;ides the&s;e, there are diver&s;e other Sorts of Trees, as <HI>Cedars</HI> in great Aboundance, which this Part of the World produces; They are very u&s;efull for building Ships and Canoa's, The&s;e <HI>Ca|noa's</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4">are like little Ferry-Boats, being made only of one Tree hollowed, and fitted, for the Sea: They are &s;o &s;wift, that they may be called <HI>Neptun</HI>'s <HI>POST-HORSES.</HI> The <HI>In|dians</HI> make the&s;e <HI>Canoa's</HI> without any Iron In&s;truments, by only burning the Trees nigh the Root, and then &s;o govern|ing the fire, as nothing is burnt more than what they would have; Some have <HI>Hatches</HI> of <HI>Flint</HI> wherewith they &s;crape or pare off what&s;oever are burnt too far, and the&s;e by fire only they give that &s;hape which renders them capable of naviga|ting 60. or 80. <HI>Leagues</HI> with ordinary Security. Here is <HI>Ba|&s;ile-Wood, Yaco</HI> is another Sort of Tree; Here are a great ma|ny <HI>Cabbage-Trees,</HI> the <HI>Cabbage</HI> growing on the Top of it. Here grows the <HI>Coco-Nut,</HI> of which the <HI>Chacolat</HI> is made. Here grows the <HI>Pinn-Apple,</HI> and a great dale of <HI>Plantine,</HI> or <HI>Sugar-Canes,</HI> of which they make <HI>Sugar;</HI> And a great dale of other Trees, which being too tedious to give you an Account of, I forbear; You may have any <HI>Trees, Roots,</HI> or <HI>Herbs,</HI> that grow in <HI>Europe</HI> as well as others that will not grow there, as <HI>Mammi; &amp;c.</HI> You may have a great dale of <HI>Tobacco</HI> if you plant, much better than in any Place to the Northward.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you an Account of the makeing <HI>Sugar</HI> &amp; <HI>Indigo</HI> in another place.</P>
<P><HI>Flies</HI> as In&s;ects &s;everall Sorts of them, the&s;e are as big as Hor&s;e-Flies in <HI>Enrepe,</HI> and denting them&s;elves upon Mens Bo|dys, &s;tick and &s;uck the Blood till they can no longer fly, which obliges the Inhabitants to wear continually Branches of Trees to Fan them away; There are a great dale of other Sorts, as <HI>Cochinilla</HI>'s; There are mon&s;truous <HI>Adders</HI> which are very frequent in the&s;e Places, upon which Account I dur&s;t neverly on the Gra&s;s; Here are very good Land <HI>Tortoi&s;es,</HI> which are very good meat; There are al&s;o <HI>Crocodiles,</HI> I could tell you, a good true &s;tory about One of them, but being too tedious I forbear.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<P>There is a great dale of <HI>Doggs, Deer, Rabbets,</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> and many other Sorts of Quadrupeds, which Ye have not the like of in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>You have a great dale of all Sorts of Fowls many wherof do not breed in <HI>Europe,</HI> as <HI>Parrots;</HI> They make their Ne&s;ts in Holes of <HI>Palmito</HI> Trees, which Holes are before made by other Birds, for they are not capable of excavating any wood tho' never &s;o &s;oft, having their own Bills too crooked and blunt; Hence provident Nature hath &s;upplyed them with the Labour of other Birds called <HI>Carpenteros,</HI> or <HI>Carpinters;</HI> The&s;e are no bigger than <HI>Sparrows:</HI> Yet having &s;uch hard and pierce|ing Bills, that no Iron In&s;trument can be made fitter to ex|cavate any Tree, though never &s;o &s;olid, and hard; And the&s;e Holes the Parrots getting Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of build their Ne&s;ts.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Pigeons</HI> of all Sorts we are aboundantly provided; There is another &s;mall Bird here called <HI>Cabreros,</HI> or <HI>Goat-Keepers,</HI> and chiefly feed upon <HI>Crabs</HI> of the <HI>Sea;</HI> In the&s;e Birds are &s;eaven di&s;tinct <HI>Bladders</HI> of <HI>Gall,</HI> and their Fle&s;h is as bitter as <HI>Aloes:</HI> Of the&s;e We have aboundance.</P>
<P>There are very many <HI>Crows,</HI> or <HI>Ravens,</HI> more trouble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ome, than u&s;efull, who make a mo&s;t hideous Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>We have &s;everal fruits &amp; roots very u&s;efull, as <HI>Potat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> they dres them only by well boiling them in a Kettle, with fair clean water; Then we cover them with a Cloath for half an Hour where they become as &s;oft as boiled <HI>Che&s;nuts;</HI> Of the &s;aid <HI>Pa|tates</HI> we make a Drink called <HI>Maiz:</HI> They cut them into &s;mall &s;lices, and cover them with hot water; when they are well imbibed they pre&s;s them through a cour&s;e Cloath, and the <HI>Liquor</HI> that comes throgh tho &s;omething thick they keep in Ve&s;&s;els made for that Purpo&s;e; Hereafter &s;ettling two or three Days, it works: And having thrown off its <HI>Lees,</HI> is
<PB N="8" REF="5">fit for Drink They u&s;e with great Delight, and tho' it be &s;omewhat four: Yet it is very plea&s;ant, &s;ub&s;tantial, and ex|traordinary whol&s;ome; The Invention of this is wholly owing to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as many other things found out for the Pre&s;ervation of Mans Life.</P>
<P>There is a Root called by the Indians <HI>Cazave</HI> of which they make a Liquor called <HI>Vey-Con</HI> much like unto <HI>Beer.</HI></P>
<P>Another Fruit called <HI>Bananas,</HI> is an excellent Liquor, which in Strength, and Plea&s;antne&s;s of Ta&s;t, may be compa|red to the be&s;t Wines of <HI>Spain:</HI> But this Liquor ea&s;ily cau|&s;es Drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>VVe begin now to plant <HI>Tobacco</HI> for Trade; The Manner whereof is this: VVe make Bedds of Earth 12. Foot &s;quare, the&s;e thay cover with <HI>Palmito</HI> Leaves, that the Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI> may not reach the Earth; Then we water them when it doth not rain, as we do our Gardens in <HI>Europe;</HI> Being grown about the Bigne&s;s of young <HI>Lettuce:</HI> we tran&s;plant it into &s;treight Lines in &s;pacious Fields, &s;etting every Plant 3. Foot di&s;tant from each other; The <HI>Tobacco</HI> mu&s;t be weeded very carefully: &s;eing the lea&s;t Root of any other Herb comeing near it hinders its Grouth.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of Fi&s;h which the <HI>Indians</HI> many times eat of it is much like unto a <HI>Cow,</HI> becau&s;e its Head, No&s;e, and Teeth, are very like to them; They are found commonly where under the Depth of the waters its full of Gra&s;s, in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ich its thought they feed; They have no Ears, but in place of them two little Holes, as wide as ones little finger; Near the Neck thy have two Finns, under which are two Uders like the Brea&s;t of a VVoman; The Skin is very clo&s;s, this Skin on the Back is two finger thick which being dryed is as hard as whalebone, and may &s;erve to make walking &s;taffs
<PB N="9" REF="5">the Belly is in all things like that of a <HI>Cow,</HI> as far as the <HI>Reins;</HI> their manner of engendring is the &s;ame with that of a land Cow, the Male being every way like that of a <HI>Bull;</HI> they conceave and breed but once, but what Time they go with <HI>Calf,</HI> I could learn; The&s;e Fi&s;hes have a very acute Sen&s;e of <HI>Hearing,</HI> &s;o as in takeing them the fi&s;her-men make|ing not the lea&s;t Noi&s;e do not row unle&s;s very &s;lightly, for this rea&s;on they u&s;e certain In&s;truments for Rowing, by the <HI>Indians</HI> called <HI>Pagayos</HI> with which they row without any Noi&s;e to fright the fi&s;h while they are a fi&s;hing they &s;peak not one to another only make &s;igns, they dart them with Javelins having two Hooks at the End; The&s;e fi&s;h are ordinarly from 20 to 24 Foot long; Their Fle&s;h is good to eat, being in like in colour to that of a land Cow, but in ta&s;te to Pork It hath much <HI>Fat,</HI> or <HI>Grea&s;e,</HI> which We make Oil of.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o another fi&s;h called <HI>Tortoi&s;e,</HI> of an indiffe|rent Bigne&s;s, and of a green Colour, their Scales are &s;ome|what hard, and of a very plea&s;ant Ta&s;te; There is another Sort &s;omewhat &s;maller; this Sort commonly keep them&s;elves among the Rocks, whence they crawl out for Food, which is generally <HI>Sea-Apples;</HI> The&s;e other above mentioned, feed on <HI>Gra&s;s,</HI> which grows in the Water on the &s;andy Banks; Their Eggs are almo&s;t like the&s;e of a <HI>Crocodile,</HI> but without any <HI>&s;hell,</HI> being only covered with a thin <HI>film;</HI> They are found in &s;uch prodigious Quantitys along the &s;hore, that were they not frequently de&s;troy'd by Birds, the Seas would abound with <HI>Tortoi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The Way and Manner of fi&s;hing them is as follows; <HI>viz.</HI> by makeing a great Nail, or Kind of Dart; this they fix at the End of a long Pole, with which they kill the <HI>Tortoi|&s;es</HI> whenever they appear above Water.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> for the mo&s;t part are very dextrous in takeing the&s;e <HI>Tortoi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>I will give you an Account of our &s;hooting of &s;ome <HI>Mon|keys,</HI> and <HI>Birds</HI> called <HI>Phea&s;ants;</HI> The Toil of &s;hooting did &s;eem, at lea&s;t to me, to be &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated with the Plea&s;ure of killing the <HI>Monkeys,</HI> for at the&s;e We made ordi|narly 15 or 16 &s;hot before We could kill three or four, &s;o nimbly would they e&s;cape our Hands, and aim even after be|ing much wounded; On the other &s;ide it was a Diver&s;ion to &s;ee the femal Monkeys carry their little Ones on their backs when any Per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed under the Trees-where the&s;e Monkeys are &s;itting; They will commonly &s;quirt their Excrements u|pon our Heads and Cloaths; likewi&s;e if &s;hooting at any, one happen to be wounded, the re&s;t flock about him, and do lay their Paws upon the Wound to hinder the blood from i&s;&s;uing forth, others gather <HI>Mo&s;s</HI> from the Trees and thru&s;t into the Wound, and hereby &s;top the Blood; At other times they gather &s;uch or &s;uch <HI>Herbs,</HI> and cheuing them in their Mouth apply as Poultties, all which cau&s;ed in Me great Admiration, &s;eing &s;uch &s;trange Actions in the&s;e irrational Creatures, which te&s;tified the fidelity and love they had for one another.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give you an Account, by the way, of the <HI>People;</HI> I have learned to &s;peak &s;omewhat of the <HI>Language</HI> by One of them them who can &s;peak tolerable good <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I enquir'd into their <HI>Customs, Lives,</HI> and <HI>Policy:</HI> whereof I give you this Account; They are governed by a King, and &s;everall Princes: they have generally a great Hatred a|gain&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> There are a great many per&s;ons of them; they are very courtious to any that give them any thing. Here are two Sorts of People of them: The one Sort cultivates the Ground, and make Plantations; the&s;e are mo&s;t numerous,
<PB N="11" REF="6">the other is a lazy &s;ort, never &s;een but at Night: They have <HI>Hutts</HI> that they live in all Day, till Night; they not care|ing for any other Habitation</P>
<P>They u&s;e no other Cloaths than an <HI>Apron</HI> ty'd to their Middle, comeing down &s;o as to hide their <HI>Privitys;</HI> &s;uch Aprons are made of the <HI>Rinds</HI> of <HI>Trees,</HI> which they &s;trongly beat upon <HI>Stones</HI> till they are &s;ofned; The &s;ame they u&s;e for <HI>Bed-Cloaths,</HI> except a few who make them of <HI>Cotton,</HI> they are whiter than the white&s;t in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The other is of a <HI>Browni&s;h</HI> Colour, but very hand&s;ome Bodys of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> tightly limb'd, the Men of them are verie dextruous at <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Arrow,</HI> and very good <HI>&s;pears</HI> the common Sort u&s;e &s;pears of <HI>Timber,</HI> the points are &s;hod with <HI>Iron,</HI> or <HI>teeth</HI> of <HI>Crocodiles.</HI> They are mo&s;t dextruous in <HI>Swimming,</HI> I did never &s;ee the like of them in <HI>Doucking</HI> for they will continue near half an Hour below the <HI>Wa|ter.</HI></P>
<P>I could never learn what <HI>Religion</HI> they have, all I could learn was they neither believe in, nor &s;erve the <HI>Devil:</HI> as many other Nations in <HI>America,</HI> do; Hereby they are not &s;o much tormented by him as other Nations are. They are ve|ry attentive at our Form of <HI>Wor&s;hip;</HI> they did tell me they did not like <HI>Spaniards</HI> Religion, for they are as ill as tho&s;e that wor&s;hip the <HI>Devil,</HI> for that Religion can not be good which is &s;o cruel.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Food con&s;i&s;ts in &s;everall <HI>Fruits,</HI> a little in|dian <HI>Corn;</HI> Fruits, &s;uch as <HI>Bananas, Racoves, Ananas, Pota|tos, Cazave;</HI> As al&s;o <HI>Crabs,</HI> and &s;everall <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> which they kill in the fea with <HI>Darts,</HI> which they are wonderfully dex|truous at.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="7"><HI>Liquors;</HI> The commone&s;t among them is called <HI>Achioc,</HI> this is made of a certain <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> brui&s;ed and &s;teept in hot water, till it be &s;ettled at the Bottom.

This Liquor they drink for Plea&s;ure, and as a great Regale, &s;o that when they invite any of their Friends, or Relations, they cannot treat them better than with this plea&s;ant Drink.</P>
<P>They are very unskilful in dre&s;&s;ing Victuals; &s;o that they very &s;eldom treat one another with Banquets. But when they invite others they de&s;ire them to come and drink of their Liquors. Before the invited Per&s;ons come to their Hou&s;e, tho&s;e that expect them, comb their Hair verie well, and anoint their Faces with the Oil of <HI>Palm,</HI> mixt with a black Tincture which renders them very hideous, The women, al&s;o dawb their Faces with another Sort of Stuff, which makes them look is red as <HI>Crim&s;on.</HI> And &s;uch are their greate&s;t Orna|ment, and Attire, Then He that invites, takes his Arms, which are three or four <HI>Azagayas,</HI> and goes out his <HI>Cottage</HI> 3 or 400 Steps, to wait for, and receive the invited per&s;ons. As &s;oon as they draw nigh, he falls down on the Ground, lying flat on his Face, without any Motion, as if he were dead; being thus pro&s;trat, the invited Friends take him up, and &s;et him on his Feet, and go altogether to the <HI>Hutt.</HI> Here the Per&s;ons invited, u&s;e the &s;ame Ceremony falling down to the Ground, as the Inviter did before.

<PB N="13" REF="7">Cottage, where he cau&s;es them to &s;it. The VVomen on the&s;e Occa&s;ions u&s;e few, or no Ceremonys.</P>
<P>Being thus brought into the Hou&s;e, they are pre&s;ented every one with a <HI>Calaba&s;h,</HI> of about two <HI>Pynts</HI> of <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure, full of <HI>Achioc</HI> almo&s;t as thick as Water-Gruel, or Children-Pap. The&s;e they are to drink off, and get down at any Rate.</P>
<P>The&s;e Calaba&s;hes being emptied, the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, with many Ceremonys, goes about the Room, and gathereth his Calaba&s;hes. And this Drinking hitherto is reckon'd but one Wellcome. Afterwards, they drink of the <HI>Achioch</HI> above mention'd, to which they were invited.</P>
<P>Then follow many Songs and Dances, and 1000 Care&s;&s;es, to the Women; So that oftentemes, for a Te&s;timony of their great Love, they take their Darts, and with the points, they pierce and wound their genital parts. This I could believe, though often affirmed to me, till my own Eyes were Witt|ne&s;&s;es of the&s;e and the like actions. Neither only on this Oc|ca&s;ion do they u&s;e this Ceremony of pierceing their Genitals, but al&s;o when they make love to any Woman, thereby to let them under&s;tand the Greatne&s;s of their Affection, and Con|&s;tancy.</P>
<P>They marry not any young Maid without the Con&s;ent of her Paients. If any de&s;ires to take a Wife; he is fir&s;t exa|mined by the Dam&s;els Father concerning feverall Sorts of good Husbandry. The&s;e are commonly, whether He can make <HI>Azagayas,</HI> Darts for fi&s;hing; or &s;pin a certain <HI>Thread,</HI> which they u&s;e about their Arrows. Having an&s;wered to Satisfa|ction, the Examiner cals to his Daughter, for a little <HI>Caba|la&s;h</HI> full of <HI>Achioc.</HI> Of this he drinks fir&s;t; then gives the <HI>Cup</HI> to the young Man; and He to the Bride, who drinks it out and with this only Ceremony the <HI>Marriage</HI> is made. When
<PB N="14" REF="8">any one drinks to the Health of another, the &s;econd Per&s;on is to drink out the Liquor, le&s;t in the <HI>Calaba&s;h,</HI> but in Ca&s;e of Marriage, as was &s;aid, it is con&s;um'd only among them three: And the Bride allways obtaining, by far, the greater &s;hare.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Woman</HI> lys in, neither She nor her Husband ob|&s;erve the Time, co&s;tomarie among the <HI>Carribes;</HI> But as &s;oon as the VVoman is delevered, &s;he goes to the next <HI>River, Brook</HI> or <HI>Fountain,</HI> and wa&s;hes the new-born Creature, &s;wathing it up in certain <HI>Rowlers,</HI> or <HI>Swath-Bands,</HI> there call'd <HI>Cabalas.</HI> This done &s;he goes about Her ordinarie Labour.

<P>I &s;hall further give You an Account of our going up the country to their <HI>King</HI> or chief <HI>Captain;</HI> we marching from our <HI>Fort</HI> with Captain <HI>Andraeas,</HI> and other of their <HI>Princes:</HI> We began our March towards their head Place, where their <HI>King</HI> re&s;ided, fir&s;t through a &s;mall Skirt of a <HI>Wood,</HI> and then over a <HI>Bay</HI> almo&s;t three <HI>Miles,</HI> or a <HI>League</HI> in Length. After that We went about &s;ix or &s;eaven <HI>Miles</HI> up a woody <HI>Valley,</HI> and We &s;aw here and there &s;ome old <HI>Plantation,</HI> and had a very good Path to march in. There we came to the &s;ide of a <HI>Ri|ver,</HI> which in mo&s;t places was dry, and built Us <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> or rather <HI>Hutts,</HI> to lodge in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> forbad us to ly upon the <HI>Gra&s;s,</HI> for Fear of
<PB N="16" REF="9">mon&s;truous <HI>Adders,</HI> which are very fiequent in tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>Breakeing &s;ome of the <HI>Stones</HI> that lay in the <HI>River,</HI> We found them &s;hine with <HI>Sparks</HI> of <HI>Gold;</HI> The&s;e Stones were driven down from the neighbouring <HI>Mountains</HI> in Time of <HI>Floods.</HI></P>
<P>The next day of our March We mounted a very &s;teep <HI>Hill,</HI> and on the other &s;ide, at the <HI>Foot</HI> thereof, We re&s;ted on the <HI>Bank</HI> of a <HI>River,</HI> which Captain <HI>Andraeas</HI> told us, ran into South <HI>Sea,</HI> being the &s;ame River on which the Town of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> was &s;ituated. Hence We continued our March till a|bout <HI>Noon,</HI> and then a&s;cended another Mountain, far high|er than the former; Here We were often, and in many pla|ces in great Danger, the Mountain being &s;o nigh to a <HI>Per|pendicular,</HI> and the <HI>Path</HI> &s;o narrow, that but one Man at a Time could pa&s;s, We arrived in the <HI>Evening</HI> on the other Side of ihe Mountain, and lodg'd again by the Side of the &s;ame River.</P>
<P>Next <HI>Morning,</HI> We march'd all along the River aforemen|tion'd, cro&s;&s;ing it often, almo&s;t at ev'ry half Mile, &s;ometimes up to the <HI>Knees,</HI> and at other times up to the Middle, in a very rapid current. About Noon we came to a place, where we found &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Hou&s;es. The&s;e were very large, and neat: The &s;ides were built of <HI>Cabbage</HI>-Trees, and the Roofs of wild: <HI>Canes,</HI> thatch'd with <HI>Palmito-Royal;</HI> They had ma|ny Partitions, or di&s;tinct Ground-Roomes, but no A&s;cent by <HI>Stairs.</HI> At this place were four of the&s;e Hou&s;es together, all within a Stone's throw of one another, each of them have|ing a large <HI>Plantan</HI> Walk before it. Half a Mile from this place, liv'd the <HI>King,</HI> or chief <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Da|rian</HI> whe came to vi&s;it Us in Royal <HI>Robes,</HI> with his <HI>Queen.</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI> His <HI>Crown</HI> was made of &s;mall white <HI>Reeds</HI> cu|riou&s;ly
<PB N="17" REF="9">woven, having no other <HI>Top</HI> than its lineing, which was red <HI>Silk.</HI> Round about the middle of it was a thin plate of <HI>Gold,</HI> about two Inches broad, lac'd behind, in which &s;tuck two or three <HI>O&s;trich</HI> Feathers. About this Plate went al&s;o a Row of golden Beads, which were bigger than ordinar <HI>Pea&s;e;</HI> underneath which was &s;een the red lining of the <HI>Crown.</HI> In his No&s;e he wore a large Plate of Gold, in Form of an half-<HI>Moon;</HI> and in each Ear a great gold Ring, nigh four Inches diameter with a round thin plate of Gold of the &s;ame Breadth, having an &s;mall Hole in the Center, by which it hung to the Ring. He was covered with a thin white <HI>Col|ton</HI> Robe, reaching to the &s;mall of his <HI>Leggs,</HI> and round its Bottom a Frienge of the &s;ame, three Inches deep; &s;o that by rea&s;on of the length of this Robe, We could &s;ee no farther than his naked <HI>Anckles.</HI> In his Hand He had a long bright <HI>Lance</HI> as &s;harp as any Knife. With Him He had three Sons each of them having a white Robe, and their Lances in their Hands, but &s;tanding bare-headed before Him; as al&s;o did eight or nine Per ons more of his Retinue, or Guard.</P>
<P>His <HI>Queen</HI> wore a red <HI>Blanket,</HI> which was clo&s;ly girt a|bout her <HI>wa&s;t,</HI> and another that came lo&s;ely over her head and &s;houlders. She had a young child in her Arms, &amp; two Daugh|ters walked by her, with their Faces almo&s;t covered with &s;tripps, or &s;treaks of red, and about their Necks, and Armes almo&s;t loaden with &s;mall Beads of &s;everall Colours. The&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Women of <HI>Darian,</HI> are generally very free, airy, &amp; brisk; yet withall very mode&s;t, and cautious in their Hu&s;|bands Pre&s;ence, of who&s;e Jealou&s;ie they &s;tand in Fear. With the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> We made an Exchainge, or had a Truck, as it is called, for <HI>Knives, Pins, Needles,</HI> or any &s;uch-like Tri|fles; but in our Dealing with them we found them to be very cunning.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="10">

<P>I &s;hall now give You an Account of the re&s;t of their <HI>Cap|tains.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Ambro&s;io</HI> commands from the River <HI>Pinas, Bono|nos, Mango,</HI> and <HI>Cocos,</HI> to the <HI>Samblas,</HI> He is a Man above &s;ixty, but &s;trong and vigorous, a mortall Enemy to the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> with whom He has had long <HI>War;</HI> He is e&s;teem'd the brave&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;uccesfull of all their Commanders on every Occa&s;ion; He's of a middle Size, well made, &s;trongly limb'd, and of a grave, and &s;omewhat &s;tern Countenance.</P>
<P>He has a Son in law, one <HI>Pedro,</HI> a brisk little Fellow who &s;peaks good <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> haveing been a Slave to them at <HI>Panama</HI> for &s;everall Years, and who can never forget, nor forgive, their U&s;age of him there.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Diego</HI> commands from the Bottom of the Gulph of <HI>&V;raba</HI> on this &s;ide to <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, and has about 3000. Men under his Command; He is e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t powerfull a|mong&s;t them, and has been at War with the <HI>Spaniard</HI> about
<PB N="19" REF="10">a twelve Month. The Occa&s;ion was this: The <HI>Indians</HI> ha|veing found three Gold Mines within his Juri&s;diction, being two &s;mall ones, and a very great Vein, con&s;ulted with them|&s;elves what to do; And being &s;en&s;ible that they did not under&s;tand how to work them, concluded to di&s;cover them to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> provided they'd allow them &s;uch a &s;hare of the Profit. This was agreed to, and faithfully promi&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but no &s;ooner had the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hew'd the <HI>Mines</HI> but they &s;hut up two of them, and put &s;trong guards upon them, and fell to work upon the third, of which the <HI>Indians</HI> demanding their &s;hare, they beat and abu&s;ed them, calling them their Slaves, and threatned to exterminat them, which provock'd them &s;o, that a little time after, they &s;iez'd upon 20. <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and 3. <HI>Priests,</HI> and cut them all to pieces.</P>
<P>The next to <HI>Diego,</HI> is one Captain <HI>Pow&s;igo</HI> of <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, He is one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Clergy-Men, and commands that Part of the Coa&s;t which lyes between <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, and golden I&s;land; He is but a &s;mall Captain; and Brother in Law to <HI>Andraeas.</HI></P>

<P>Captain <HI>Andraeas</HI> has often been at <HI>Panama,</HI> the <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Sauta Maria,</HI> and the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> believeing he might be u&s;efull to them, made Him a Captain, by giveing Him a &s;tick tip't with Silver, upon which He values him&s;elf above others, and that has (we are apt to believe) endeared Him to their Intere&s;ts; yet the Love of ones Country, and Liberty is &s;o naturall, that we have good Rea&s;on to believe that as &s;oon (being a &s;en&s;ible cunning Fellow) as He finds we are able to protect Him, he will heartily join to our In|tere&s;t.</P>
