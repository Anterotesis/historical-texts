<P><HI>_I</HI> Being in &s;hip called the &s;ea|venture, with <HI>Sir THOMAS Gates,</HI> our Go|uernour, <HI>Sir GEORGE Som|mers,</HI> and Ca|ptaine <HI>New|port,</HI> three mo&s;t worthy honoured Gentlemen, (who&s;e valour and forti|tude the world mu&s;t needes take no|tice off, and that in mo&s;t Honourable
<PB N="4" REF="4">de&s;ignes) bound for Virginia, in the height of thirty degrees of northerly latitude, or thereabouts: we were taken with a mo&s;t &s;harpe and cruell &s;torme vpon the fiue and twentieth day of Iuly, <HI>Anno 1609.</HI> which did not only &s;eparate vs from the re&s;idue of our fleete, (which were eight in number) but with the violent wor|king of the Seas, our &s;hip became &s;o &s;haken, torne, and leaked, that &s;hee receiued &s;o much water, as couered two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ire of hog&s;heads aboue the bal|la&s;t; that our men &s;toode vp to the middles, with buckets, baricos, and kettles, to baile out the water, and continually pumped for three dayes and three nights together, without any intermi&s;&s;ion; and yet the water &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e, then to di|mini&s;h: in &s;o much that all our men, being vtterly &s;pent, tyred, and di&s;a|bled for longer labour, were euen re|&s;olued, without any hope of their
<PB N="5" REF="4">liues, to &s;hut vp the hatches, and to haue committed them&s;elues to the mercy of the &s;ea, (which is &s;aid to be mercile&s;&s;e) or rather to the mercy of their mighty God and redeemer, (who&s;e mercies exceed all his works) &s;eeing no helpe, nor hope, in the ap|prehen&s;ion of mans rea&s;on, that any mothers child could e&s;cape that ine|uitable danger, which euery man had propo&s;ed and dige&s;ted to him&s;elfe, of pre&s;ent &s;inking. So that &s;ome of them hauing &s;ome good and comfortable waters in the &s;hip, fetcht them, and drunke one to the other, taking their la&s;t leaue one of the other, vntill their more ioyfull and happy meeting, in a more ble&s;&s;ed world; when it plea&s;ed God out of his mo&s;t gracious and mercifull prouidence, &s;o to direct and guide our &s;hip, (being left to the mer|cy of the &s;ea) for her mo&s;t aduantage; that <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> (&s;itting vpon the poope of the &s;hip, (where he &s;ate
<PB N="6" REF="5">three dayes and three nights toge|ther, without meales meate, and lit|tle or no &s;leepe) couning the &s;hippe to keepe her as vpright as he could, (for otherwi&s;e &s;hee mu&s;t needes in&s;tantly haue foundred) mo&s;t wi&s;hedly happi|ly di&s;cryed land; whereupon he mo&s;t comfortably encouraged the compa|ny to follow their pumping, and by no meanes to cea&s;e bayling out of the water, with their buckets, baricos, and kettles; whereby they were &s;o o|uer wearied, and their &s;pirits &s;o &s;pent with long fa&s;ting, and continuance of their labour, that for the mo&s;t part they were fallen a&s;leepe in corners, and where&s;oeuer they chanced fir&s;t to &s;it or lie: but hearing news of land, wherewith they grew to bee &s;ome|what reuiued, being carried with wil and de&s;ire beyond their &s;trength, eue|ry man bu&s;led vp, and gathered his &s;trength and feeble &s;pirits together, to performe as much as their weake
<PB N="7" REF="5">force would permit him: through which weake meanes, it plea&s;ed God to worke &s;o &s;trongly as the water was &s;taide for that little time, (which as we all much feared, was the la&s;t period of our breathing) and the &s;hip kept from pre&s;ent &s;inking, when it plea&s;ed God to &s;end her within halfe an Engli&s;h mile, of that land that <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> had not long before di&s;cryed: Which were the Ilandes of the Barmudas. And there neither did our &s;hip &s;incke, but more fortu|nately in &s;o great a misfortune, fell in betweene two rockes, where &s;hee was fa&s;t lodged and locked, for fur|ther budging: whereby we gayned, not only &s;ufficient time, with the pre|&s;ent helpe of our boate, and skiffe, &s;afely to &s;et, and conuey our men a|&s;hore (which were one hundred and fifty in number) but afterwards had time and lea&s;ure to &s;aue &s;ome good part of our goodes and proui&s;ion,
<PB N="8" REF="6">which the water had not &s;poyled, with all the tackling of the &s;hip, and much of the yron about her, which were nece&s;&s;aries not a litle auaileable, for the building and furni&s;hing of a new &s;hip and pinnis, which we made there, for the tran&s;porting and carry|ing of vs to Virginia. But our deli|uery was not more &s;trange in falling &s;o opportunely, and happily vpon the land, as our feeding and pre&s;erua|tion, was beyond our hopes, and all mens expectations mo&s;t admirable. For the Ilands of the Barmudas, as euery man knoweth that hath heard or read of them, were neuer in|habited by any Chri&s;tian or Heathen people, but euer e&s;teemed, and repu|ted, a mo&s;t prodigious and inchanted place, affoording nothing but gu&s;ts, &s;tormes, and foule weather; which made euery Nauigator and Mariner to auoide the~, as Scylla and Charib|dis; or as they would &s;hunne the De|uill
<PB N="9" REF="6">him&s;elfe; and no man was euer heard, to make for the place, but as again&s;t their wils, they haue by &s;tormes and dangerou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the rocks, lying &s;eauen leagues into the Sea, &s;uffered &s;hipwracke; yet did we finde there the ayre &s;o temperate and the Country &s;o aboundantly fruitful of all fit nece&s;&s;aries, for the &s;u&s;tenta|tion and pre&s;eruation of mans life, that mo&s;t in a manner of all our pro|ui&s;ions of bread, beare, and victuall, being quite &s;poyled, in lying long drowned in &s;alt water, notwith&s;tan|ding we were there for the &s;pace of nine moneths (few dayes ouer or vn|der) not only well refre&s;hed, comfor|ted, and with good &s;atiety contented, but out of the aboundance thereof, prouided vs &s;ome rea&s;onable quanti|ty and proportion of proui&s;ion, to car|ry vs for Virginia, and to maintaine our &s;elues, and that company wee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ound there, to the great releefe of
<PB N="10" REF="7">them, as it fell out in their &s;o great ex|tremities, and in re&s;pect of the &s;hort|ne&s;&s;e of time, vntill it plea&s;ed God, that by my Lords comming thither, their &s;tore was better &s;upplyed. And greater, and better proui&s;ions wee might haue made, if we had had bet|ter meanes for the &s;toring and tran&s;|portation thereof. Wherefore my o|pinion &s;incerely of this Iland is, that whereas it hath beene, and is &s;till accounted, the mo&s;t dangerous infortunate, and mo&s;t forlorne place of the world, it is in truth the riche&s;t, healthfulle&s;t, and plea&s;ing land, (the quantity and bigne&s;&s;e thereof con&s;i|dered) and meerely naturall, as euer man &s;et foote vpon: the particular profits and benefits whereof, &s;hal be more e&s;pecially in&s;erted, and hereun|to annexed, which euery man to his owne priuate knowledge, that was there, can auouch and iu&s;tifie for a truth. Vpon the eight and twentieth
<PB N="11" REF="7">day of Iuly <HI>1609.</HI> (after the extre|mity of the &s;torme, was &s;omething qualified) we fell vpon the &s;hore at the Barmudas; where after our ge|nerall <HI>Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Newport,</HI> had by their prouident carefulne&s;&s;e lan|ded all their men, and &s;o much of the goods and proui&s;ions out of the &s;hip, as was not vtterly &s;poyled, euerie man di&s;po&s;ed and applyed him&s;elfe, to &s;earch for, and to &s;eeke out &s;uch re|leefe and &s;u&s;tentation, as the Coun|try afforded: and <HI>Sir George Sommers,</HI> a man inured to extremities, (and knowing what thereunto belonged) was in this &s;eruice, neither idle nor backward, but pre&s;ently by his care|full indu&s;try, went and found out &s;uf|ficient, of many kind of fi&s;hes, and &s;o plentifull thereof, that in halfe an houre, he tooke &s;o many great fi&s;hes with hookes, as did &s;uffice the whole company one day. And fi&s;h is there
<PB N="12" REF="8">&s;o aboundant, that if a man &s;teppe in|to the water, they will come round about him; &s;o that men were faine to get out for feare of byting. The&s;e fi|&s;hes are very fat and &s;weete, and of that proportion and bigne&s;&s;e, that three of them will conueniently lade two men: tho&s;e we called rock fi&s;h. Be&s;ides there are &s;uch aboundance of mullets, that with a &s;eane might be taken at one draught one thou&s;and at the lea&s;t, and infinite &s;tore of pil|chards, with diuers kindes of great fi&s;hes, the names of them vnknowne to me: of crayfi&s;hes very great ones, and &s;o great &s;tore as that there hath beene taken in one night with ma|king lights, euen &s;ufficient to feede the whole co~pany a day. The Coun|try affordeth great aboundance of Hogs, as that there hath beene taken by <HI>Sir George Sommers,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that hunted for them, to the number of two and thirty at one
<PB N="13" REF="8">time, which he brought to the com|pany in a boate, built by his owne hads. There is Fowle in great num|vpon the Ilands, where they breed, that there hath beene taken in two or three houres, a thou&s;and at the lea&s;t; the bird being of the bigne&s;&s;e of a good Pidgeon, and layeth egges as bigge as Hen egges vpon the &s;and, where they come and lay them day|ly, although men &s;it downe among&s;t them; that there hath beene taken vp in one morning, by <HI>Sir Thomas Gates</HI> men, one thou&s;and of egges: and <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> men, comming a lit|tle di&s;tance of time after them, haue &s;tayed there whil&s;t they came and layed their eggs among&s;t them, that they brought away as many more with them; with many young birds very fat and &s;weet. Another Sea fowle there is that lyeth in litle holes in the ground, like vnto a cony-hole, and are in great numbers, exceeding
<PB N="14" REF="9">good meate, very fat and &s;weet (tho&s;e we had in the winter) and their eggs are white, and of that bigne&s;&s;e, that they are not to be knowne from Hen egges. The other birds egges are &s;peckled, and of a different colour: there are al&s;o great &s;core and plenty of Herons, and tho&s;e &s;o familiar and tame, that wee beate them downe from the trees with &s;tones and &s;taues; but &s;uch were young Herons: be&s;ides many white Herons, with|out &s;o much as a blacke or gray fea|ther on them; with other &s;mall birds &s;o tame and gentle, that a man wal|king in the woods with a &s;licke, and whi&s;tling to them, they wil come and gaze on you, &s;o neare that you may &s;trike and kill many of them with your &s;ticke; and with &s;inging and hollowing you may doe the like. There are al&s;o great &s;tore of Torto|&s;es, (which &s;ome call Turtles) and tho&s;e &s;o great, that I haue &s;eene a
<PB N="15" REF="9">bu&s;hel of egges in one of their bellies, which are &s;weeter then any Henne egge: and the Torto&s;e it &s;elfe, is all very good meate, and yeeldeth great &s;tore of oyle, which is as &s;weete as a|ny butter; and one of them will &s;uffice fifty men a meale, at the lea&s;t: and of the&s;e hath beene taken great &s;tore, with two boates, at the lea&s;t forty in one day. The Country yeeldeth di|uers fruits, as prickled peares, great aboundance, which continue greene vpon the trees all the yeare; al&s;o great plenty of Mulberries, white and red: and on the &s;ame are great &s;tore of Silke-wormes, which yeeld cods of &s;ilke, both white and yellow, being &s;ome cour&s;e, and &s;ome fine. And there is a tree called a Palmito tree, which hath a very &s;weet berry, vp|on which the hogs doe mo&s;t feede; but our men finding the &s;weetne&s;&s;e of them, did willingly &s;hare with the hogs for them, they being very plea|&s;ant
<PB N="16" REF="10">and whol&s;ome, which made them carele&s;&s;e almo&s;t of any bread with their meate; which occa&s;ioned vs to carry in a manner all that &s;tore of flower and meale, we did or could &s;aue for Virginia. The head of the Palmito tree is very good meate, ei|ther raw or &s;odden, it yeeldeth a head which waigheth about twenty pound, and is farre better meate, then any cabbidge. There are an infi|nite number of Cedar trees, (the fai|re&s;t I thinke in the world) and tho&s;e bring forth a very &s;weet berry, and whol&s;ome to eate. The Country (for as much as I could find my &s;elf, or heare by others) affords no veni|mous creature, or &s;o much as a Rat or Mou&s;e, or any other thing vn|whol&s;ome. There is great &s;tore of Pearle, and &s;ome of them very faire, round, and Orientall; and you &s;hall finde at lea&s;t one hundred &s;eede of Pearle in one Oy&s;ter; there hath
<PB N="17" REF="10">beene likewi&s;e found, &s;ome good quantity of Amber Greece, and that of the be&s;t &s;ort. There are al&s;o great plenty of Whales, which I conceaue are very ea&s;ie to be killed, for they come &s;o v&s;ually, and ordi|narily to the &s;hore, that we heard them oftentimes in the night a bed; and haue &s;eene many of them neare the &s;hore, in the day time. There was borne vpon the Barmudas, at the time of our being there two chil|dren, the one a man child, there bap|ti&s;ed, by the name of Barmudas: and a woman child, bapti&s;ed by the name of Barmuda: as al&s;o there was a marriage betweene two En|gli&s;h people vpon that Iland. This Iland, I meane the mayne Iland, with all the broken Ilandes adia|cent, are made in the forme of a half Moone, but a little more rounder, and diuided into many broken I|lands,
<PB N="18" REF="11">and there are many good harbours in it, but wee could finde one e&s;peciall place to goe in, or ra|ther to goe out from it, which was not altogether free from &s;ome dan|ger, and that lyeth on the South|ea&s;t-&s;ide, where there is three fa|thoms water, at the entrance ther|of, but within &s;ixe, &s;eauen, or eight fathoms at the lea&s;t, where you may &s;afely lie land-locked, from the danger of all winds and weathers, and more to the trees. The co~ming into it, is &s;o narrow and &s;traight be|tweene the rocks, as that it will with &s;mall &s;tore of munition be for|tified, and ea&s;ily defended, with all aduantage the place affords, again&s;t the forces of the Potente&s;t King of Europe. There are al&s;o plenty of Haukes, and very good Tobacco, as I thinke, which through forget|fulne&s;&s;e, I had almo&s;t omitted:
<PB N="19" REF="11">now hauing fini&s;hed and rigged our &s;hip, and pinnis, the one called the Deliuerance, the pinnis the Pati|ence, wee prepared and made our &s;elues ready, to &s;hip for Virginia, hauing powdred &s;ome &s;tore of hogs fle&s;h, for proui&s;ion thither, and the company thereof, for &s;ome rea&s;ona|ble time: but were compelled to make &s;alt there for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, for all our &s;alt was &s;pent and &s;poyled, before wee recouered the &s;hore. Wee carryed with vs al&s;o a good portion of Torto&s;e oyle, which either for frying or baking did vs very great plea&s;ure, it being very &s;weete, nouri&s;hing, and whol&s;ome: the greate&s;t defects we found there, was tarre and pitch for our &s;hip and pinnis, in &s;teede whereof wee were forced to make lime there of a hard kinde of &s;tone, and v&s;e it: which for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion and nece&s;&s;ity,
<PB N="20" REF="12">with &s;ome wax we found ca&s;t vp by the Sea, from &s;ome &s;hip wracke, &s;er|ued the turne to pay the &s;eames of the pinnis <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> built, for which hee had neither pitch nor tarre: &s;o that God in the &s;upplying of all our wants, beyond all mea|&s;ure, &s;hewed him&s;elfe &s;till mercifull vnto vs, that we might accompli&s;h our intended voyage to Virginia, for which I confidently hope, hee doth yet re&s;erue a ble&s;&s;ing in &s;tore, and to the which I pre&s;ume, euery hone&s;t and religious heart will rea|dily giue their Amen. When all thinges were made ready, and commodiou&s;ly fitted, the winde comming faire, wee &s;et &s;aile and put off from the Barmudas, the tenth day of May, in the yeare <HI>1610.</HI> and arriued at Iames towne in Virginia, the foure and twentieth day of the &s;ame Moneth: where
<PB N="21" REF="12">wee found &s;ome three&s;core per&s;ons liuing. And being then &s;ome three weeks or thereabouts pa&s;&s;ed, &amp; not hearing of anye &s;upply, it was thought fitting by a generall con|&s;ent, to v&s;e the be&s;t meanes for the pre&s;eruation of all tho&s;e people that were liuing, being all in number two hundred per&s;ons. And &s;o vp|on the eight of Iune one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ten, wee imbarked at Iames Towne: not hauing a|boue fourteene dayes victaile, and &s;o were determined to direct our cour&s;e for new-found-land, there to refre&s;h vs, and &s;upply our &s;elues with victaile, to bring vs home; but it plea&s;ed God to di&s;po&s;e other|wi&s;e of vs, and to giue vs better meanes. For being all of vs &s;hip|ped in foure pinnices, and departed from the towne, almo&s;t downe half the Riuer, wee met my Lord de la
<PB N="22" REF="13">Warre comming vp with three &s;hips, well furni&s;hed with victaile, which reuiued all the company, and gaue them great content. And after &s;ome few dayes, my Lord vn|der&s;tanding of the great plenty of Hogges and Fi&s;h, was at the Bar|mudas, and the nece&s;&s;ity of them in Virginia, was de&s;irous to &s;end thither, to &s;upply him&s;elfe with tho&s;e things, for the better com|forting of his men, and the planta|tion of the Country. Whereupon <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> being a man be&s;t acquainted with the place, and be|ing willing to doe &s;eruice vnto his Prince and Country: without any re&s;pect of his owne priuate gaine: and being of three&s;core yeares of age at the lea&s;t, out of his worthy and valiant minde, offered him&s;elfe to vndertake to performe with Gods help that dangerous voyage
<PB N="23" REF="13">for the Barmudas, for the better releefe and comfort of the people in Virginia, and for the better planta|tion of it, which offer my Lord de la warre, very willingly and thank|fully accepted: and &s;o vpon the nine|teenth of Iune, <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> imbarked him&s;elf at Iames towne in a &s;mall barge of thirty tonne, or therabout, that he built at the Bar|mudas: wherein he laboured from morning vntill night, as duelie as any workeman doth labour for wa|ges, and built her all with Cedar, with little or no yron worke at all: hauing in her but one boult, which was in the k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on: notwith&s;tanding thanks be to God, &s;hee brought vs in &s;afety to Virginia, and &s;o I tru&s;t he will protect him, and &s;end him well backe againe, to his hearts de|&s;ire, and the great comfort of all the company there.</P>
