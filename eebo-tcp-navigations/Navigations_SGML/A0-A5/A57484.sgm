<P>YOu have &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied the World of the Curio&s;ity you have for whatever, in any mea&s;ure, de|&s;erves it: You were pleas'd to give me a hint of the Piece I here pre&s;ent you withal; and your recommendation of the Original might well rai&s;e in me a hope of your readier accep|tance of the Tran&s;lation. It is the noble&s;t of humane Actions to vouch&s;afe a kind Enter|tainment to the Di&s;tre&s;s'd, whether Nature or Fortune hath made them Calamitous. The equality of Mi&s;ery makes the Endurers of it mo&s;t commonly the more compa&s;sionate; &s;o far as that tho&s;e who have been fir&s;t reliev'd charitably direct others to the &s;ame Almoners.</P>
<P>Thus do I bring to your doors a company of poor <HI>Caribbians,</HI> to offer you their Re&s;pects and Submi&s;sions, in the name of all tho&s;e I&s;lands, whereof their Ance&s;tors have been heretofore po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the Ocean of <HI>America:</HI> They are in hopes, that neither the ob&s;curity of their Origine, nor the har&s;hne&s;s of their Lan|guage, nor the barbari&s;me of their Manners, nor their &s;trange cour&s;e of Life, nor the cruelty of their Wars, nor their ancient Poverty, nor
<PB REF="3">
la&s;tly the uncon&s;tancy of their Fortune, will hinder your favourable Reception of them. And what heightens this hope of theirs, is, an imagination, that you, who find lei&s;ure to be|&s;tow your Eye and Thoughts on &s;o infinite a Multitude of Volumes as pre&s;s from all parts of the World into your Library, may be pleas'd with &s;omething that is done among them; and that the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> may entertain you, not only with a delightful Variety, as to the diverti&s;ement of the Sight, but al&s;o with many occurrences capable of exciting your Admiration.</P>
<P>What may be further &s;aid on their behalf, I leave to be expre&s;s'd in their own natural Rhetorick, and bethink me of making &s;ome Apology for my &s;elf; which is only this, That the pre&s;umption of the pre&s;ent Addre&s;s is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the effect of your Goodne&s;s and Candor, and that it had been but a nece&s;&s;ary expre&s;sion of my Gratitude, had I many years &s;ince profe&s;s'd how much I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE, Giving an account of both the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Edition of this Work.</HEAD>
<P>THE Relations we have from remote Coun|tries, for the mo&s;t part, come attended with this misfortune; that many times they are written by Per&s;ons, who, being concerned therein, for &s;ome Rea&s;ons and Con&s;iderations only known to them&s;elves, make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;gui&s;e the Truth, and repre&s;ent things otherwi&s;e than they are. Sometimes al&s;o we have to do with certain Writers, who, in cold blood, and to gratifie their own humour, would impo&s;e upon our credulity, as it were out of a defiance of being di&s;proved. And la&s;tly, it is our fate to receive Pieces of this nature from men little vers'd in &s;tudy, and &s;o &s;uch as are not able to lay down things with the requi&s;ite exactne&s;s, in|a&s;much as, upon many occa&s;ions, they take one thing for another, and relate not things truly and naturally, though they have not any intention to deceive us. On the con|trary, it is a great advantage, when &s;uch Works are com|po&s;ed by Authors, in whom the&s;e three conditions are found combining together; to wit, That they are uncon|cerned; That they dally not with Truth; and, That they have all the Requi&s;ites for the right framing of their Re|lations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;hall ca&s;t their Eyes on the pre&s;ent Hi&s;tory, are to expect therein the&s;e advantages: For as to the two fir&s;t of the forementioned Conditions, that is, to compre|hend them under one word, Sincerity, the Authors of this Work pre&s;ume to attribute it to them&s;elves, &s;ince it is an Elogy any one may innocently a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf, if his own Con&s;cience give him not a check for &s;o doing: But for the third, which relates to the ability of the mind, though
<PB REF="4">
an over-earne&s;t pretention thereto may &s;eem to proceed from a certain vanity and &s;elf-confidence; yet when all cir|cum&s;tances &s;hall be con&s;idered, the ingenuous will ea&s;ily be induced to allow them even that al&s;o.</P>
<P>For 1. The Relations they had to work upon came from Per&s;ons who had been Eye-witne&s;&s;es of what they delive|red, di&s;-intere&s;&s;ed, and of known integrity, and endued with the abilities requi&s;ite to manage &s;uch a Work. 2. There was a de&s;ign of this Hi&s;tory drawn at Paris, &s;ome years before it came abroad, and then thought worthy pub|li&s;hing, by divers intelligent men, to whom it was commu|nicated, who carefully read it over, and honoured it with their Remarks. Yet that it might come forth with greater exactne&s;s, it was laid a&s;ide, till the ob&s;ervations of after|Voyages had added much to its perfection. So that if the Publick receive any &s;atisfaction from this Hi&s;tory, it will have rea&s;on rather to congratulate, than quarrel at its de|lay; &s;ince it comes out now more enriched and exact, than it would have been, at the fir&s;t proffer of it to the Pre&s;s. For be&s;ides that many Ob&s;ervations and Relations came &s;ince to hand, the Authors made al&s;o great advantages of the private Di&s;cour&s;es they had with one Father <HI>Ray|mond,</HI> e&s;pecially as to the <HI>Moral</HI> part of the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Hi&s;tory. For this man having lived many years in tho&s;e I&s;lands, and had much conver&s;ation with the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of <HI>Dominico,</HI> came by that means to be acquainted with their Language, their Manners, and the most particular Cu&s;toms of that Nation. From the &s;ame F. <HI>Raymond</HI> they had al&s;o the <HI>Caribbian Vocabulary,</HI> which may be &s;een at the end of the Book.</P>
<P>They thought fit to divide the Hi&s;tory into two Parts, the <HI>Natural</HI> and the <HI>Moral,</HI> in imitation of that of the ex|cellent <HI>Jo&s;ephus Aco&s;ta,</HI> and they hope the Piece will be found &s;uch as to an&s;wer the Title; comprehending in the former whatever is of the natural growth of the Country, as <HI>Plants, Fruits, Flowers, Birds, Bea&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. and under the latter, what&s;oever relates to their <HI>Manners, Cu&s;toms, Religion, Vertues, Vices,</HI> &amp;c. Not that they would have it inferr'd thence, that this Treati&s;e &s;hould contain what|over might be written on the &s;ubject of the <HI>Caribbies;</HI>
<PB REF="4">
nay they acknowledge, that both the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> part of this Hi&s;tory might be much enlarged; but with this adverti&s;ement, that if every part of the <HI>New-world</HI> were &s;o diligently examined by Hi&s;torians as this hath been, the <HI>Old-world</HI> would have a much more particular account thereof, than it hath at the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o thought it not be&s;ide their purpo&s;e, e&s;pe|cially in the <HI>Moral</HI> part of the Hi&s;tory, to cite the Writings of divers other well-known Authours, not out of any de&s;ign to enlarge the Volume, as &s;ome might haply imagine; but to make a certain parallel between the Morality of our <HI>Carib|bians,</HI> and that of divers other yet Barbarous Nations; which they conceiv'd would not be undelightful to &s;ome, even though they looked on them as &s;o many digre&s;&s;ions from, or interruptions of the <HI>Carribbian</HI> Hi&s;tory. But what cen&s;ure &s;oever may be pa&s;&s;ed on them, they hope that if any &s;hall think them not nece&s;&s;arily relating to the main de&s;ign of the Draught, they may neverthele&s;s view them with a certain plea&s;ure, as the Drapery, con&s;i&s;ting of Flowers and Fruits, &amp;c. for the greater ornament of the Piece.</P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;e is the image of the thought; but the Draught of a thing by way of Painting or Graving repre&s;ents the thing it &s;elf. From this con&s;ideration it came, that this Piece is further adorn'd with &s;everal pieces of Sculpture, to the end that the Idaeas of the things particularly treated of might be the more throughly imprinted in the Readers mind, by a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration thereof.</P>
<P>Thus much as to the Authours and Directors of the <HI>Ori|ginal</HI> Edition. The Publi&s;her of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hath only the&s;e few Remarks to trouble the Reader withal.</P>
<P N="1">1. That po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, who are in|habitants in the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> may have peculiar names for divers of the Plants, Bea&s;ts, Birds, Fi&s;hes, &amp;c. mentioned in this Treati&s;e, much different from tho&s;e which the Pub|li&s;her hath u&s;ed. Some of them, upon con&s;ulation with &s;uch as had lived in tho&s;e parts he made a &s;hift to get, and in all likelihood might have gotten mo&s;t of the rest, had not the breaking forth of the l&acirc;&s;t years Contagion caus'd mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of <HI>London,</HI> to retire to their Country Habitations and Friends.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="5">2. The Reader is to note, that where &s;ome accident is &s;aid to have happened four or five, or &s;ome other number of years &s;ince (as for in&s;tance, <HI>pag.</HI> 14. where it is &s;aid in the&s;e words, that, <HI>two years &s;ince they were forced to quit their Villages, &amp;c.</HI>) it is to be referred to the coming forth of the Original Edition, which was in the year M. DC. LVIII.</P>
<P N="3">3. That whereas there might well be expected before this Work a Map of the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands in general, as al&s;o particular ones of the mo&s;t eminent I&s;lands, the Rea|der is to content him&s;elf with this &s;atisfaction from the Stationers, that if an accurate one of the whole, that is &s;uch a one as might have been &s;uitable to the other Embe|li&s;hments of the pre&s;ent Work, could have been procu|red, it &s;hould not have been wanting: With this further a&s;|&s;urance, that if what is done at the pre&s;ent meet with the reception expected, the next Impre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be furni&s;hed not only with the forementioned Map, but al&s;o &s;ome other Pieces of Ornament, whereof the la&s;t years di&s;traction, and want of time now have ob&s;tructed the in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, whereas many per&s;ons of worth (though more in the Original then in the Tran&s;lation) are mentioned in &s;e|veral places as Inhabitants of the fore&s;aid Colonies, there is only this to be &s;aid; that as the in&s;tancing of them adds &s;omewhat to the certainty of the Relations; &s;o it may like|wi&s;e &s;erve to undeceive many <HI>Europaeans,</HI> who are either &s;o ill-informed of tho&s;e I&s;lands, or &s;o prejudic'd again&s;t them, as to be per&s;waded, that, for the mo&s;t part, they are only the refuges and receptacles of Bankrupts and de|bauched per&s;ons; the contrary being mo&s;t certain; <HI>to wit,</HI> that they are inhabited by an infinite number of Families of good repute, which live civilly and in the fear of God.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Of the Scituation of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> in general; the Tem|perature of the Air, the Nature of the Country, and its Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>_BEtween the Continent of that part of <HI>Ameri|ca</HI> which lies Southward, and the Ea&s;tern Quarter of the I&s;land of S^t <HI>John Porto-Rico,</HI> there are certain I&s;lands making up together the Figure of a Bow, and &s;o di&s;pos'd that they cro&s;s the Ocean, as it were by an ob|lique line.</P>
<P>They are by &s;ome called the <HI>Antilles</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> probably upon this account, that they make a kind of bar before the greater I&s;lands, which are called the I&s;lands of <HI>America:</HI> If &s;o,
<PB N="3" REF="6" MS="y">
the word &s;hould be <HI>Ant-I&s;les,</HI> as being compos'd of the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which &s;ignifies <HI>oppo&s;ite,</HI> and <HI>I&s;les</HI> or <HI>Iles:</HI> But the Engli&s;h commonly call them the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands, and the <HI>Carib|bies.</HI> There are al&s;o who call them the <HI>Cannibal</HI>-I&s;lands, from the names of the ancient Inhabitants; and they are read in &s;ome under the name of the <HI>Camer&ccedil;ane</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands were fir&s;t di&s;covered by <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> King and Queen of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Leon,</HI> in the year of our Lord, One thou&s;and four hun|dred ninety and two.</P>
<P>There are numbred of them in all twenty eight, lying under the Torrid Zone, acounting from the eleventh degree of the Aequator, to the nineteenth Northward. Some Authors, as <HI>Lin&s;cot</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>America,</HI> taking the name of the <HI>Antilles</HI> in a more general &s;ignification, attribute it to the four greater I&s;lands, to wit, <HI>Hi&s;paniola, Cuba, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Porto-Rico,</HI> as well as to the&s;e twenty eight.</P>
<P>The Air of all the&s;e I&s;lands is temperate, and healthy enough, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as have lived any time in them. The Plague heretofore was not known in the&s;e Parts, no more than it was in <HI>China,</HI> and &s;ome other places of the Ea&s;t: But &s;ome years &s;ince mo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands were much troubled with malignant Fevers, which the Phy&s;itians held to be contagious. That cor|ruption of the Air was occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome Ships which came from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk;</HI> but now there is no talk of any &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The heats are not greater in the&s;e parts than they are in <HI>France</HI> during the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and through a particular care of Divine Providence, between eight and nine in the morning there ri&s;es a gentle Ea&s;t-wind, which many times continues till four in the afternoon, refre&s;hing the Air, and al|laying the &s;oultrine&s;s of the heat. <HI>Jo&s;ephus Aco&s;ta</HI> affirms, That in the greater I&s;lands of <HI>America</HI> this cooling wind blows about Noon. Thus through all the compa&s;s of the Torrid Zone, the wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of humane concernments hath ordered cool and regular Winds, to alleviate the &s;corching heats of the Sun.</P>
<P>It is never cold in the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> and Ice is a thing was never &s;een in tho&s;e parts; nay, it would be accounted a kind of pro|digy to find that where,</P>
<LG>
<L>All things are clad in a perpetual green,</L>
<L>And Winter only in the Snow of Lillies &s;een.</L>
</LG>
<P>But the Nights there are extreamly cool; and if a Man be un|covered during that time, he is apt to catch Colds, and great and dangerous pains in the Che&s;t and Stomach: Nay, it hath been ob&s;erv'd, That tho&s;e who have expos'd them&s;elves unco|ver'd to that plea&s;ing coolne&s;s, if they have e&s;caped pains and
<PB N="3" REF="6" MS="y">
gripings in the Stomack, have turn'd pale, yellowi&s;h, and &s;well'd up, and in a &s;hort time lo&s;t the lively vermilion Com|plexions they had before. There are indeed others attribute the&s;e effects to their feeding on <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> which is commonly eaten in the&s;e I&s;lands in&s;tead of bread, and may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome quality not con&s;i&s;tent with the natural con&s;titution of the Inhabitants of our Climates. There is the &s;ame temperature in the night time at <HI>Peru,</HI> and in the <HI>Maldivas.</HI> And tho&s;e who have travell'd to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and through all the hot Countries, do affirm, That the greater the heats are in the day time, &s;o much the colder are the nights; the rea&s;on whereof is, that the great Vapours rais'd by the Sun in the day time, being condens'd at night, and falling down in Dew, do extreamly cool and refre&s;h the Air.</P>
<P>The Aequinox la&s;ts in the&s;e I&s;lands neer one half of the year, and all the re&s;t of it the longe&s;t days are fourteen hours, and the &s;horte&s;t nights ten. And thus hath the Divine Wi&s;dom be&s;tow'd on tho&s;e Parts of the World which lye mo&s;t expos'd to the &s;corching beams of the Sun, long and cool nights, to reco|ver and re&s;tore to vigour what the too neer approaches of that Planet had dry'd up and almo&s;t bla&s;ted in the day.</P>
<P>Nor can the Year be here divided into four equal and di&s;tinct parts, as we do in <HI>Europe:</HI> But the Rains, which are very fre|quent there from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>November,</HI> and the great Droughts which reign all the re&s;t of the Year, make the only difference which may be ob&s;erv'd between the Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Now how the&s;e different Con&s;titutions and Temperatures of the Air &s;hould be called, there is a great diver&s;ity of Opinions. Some con&s;idering, that as in the&s;e Parts there is in a manner no <HI>Crepu&s;culum</HI> or Twilight (which is a certain competion of, or &s;omthing between night and day) &s;o neither is there any Spring or Autumn to make a certain connexion between Summer and a kind of Winter, which they admit there. Others maintain on the contrary, That there is no ju&s;t rea&s;on that that part of the Year which goes under the name of Winter, &s;hould be &s;o called, in regard the Earth there is never cover'd with Fro&s;t or Snow, which are the unwelcom attendants of Winter, but at all times cloath'd with a delightful Verdure, and almo&s;t in all &s;ea&s;ons crown'd with Flowers and Fruits, though in a different mea&s;ure; whence they conclude, That the Year may be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd into three different and equal parts, and tho&s;e be called Spring, Summer, Autumn; though not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable as haply they may be in &s;everal parts of the World.</P>
<P>But the common expre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e people, who make up the Colonies now planted in the&s;e I&s;lands, is not con&s;i&s;tent with this di&s;tinction; for they take the &s;ea&s;on of the rains to be Winter, and that of the droughts, which is fair, clear, and plea&s;ant, to be Summer. 'Tis true, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lib. 2. c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> quarrels at the
<PB N="4" REF="7" MS="y">
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> for expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in that manner, and ta|king tho&s;e rainy moneths for Winter. He affirms, that the time of the drought and fair weather is the true Winter in all the Torrid Zone, becau&s;e then the Sun is at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from that Region; and on the contrary, that the &s;ea&s;on of Rains and Mi&s;ts ought there to be called Summer, by rea|&s;on of the nearne&s;s of that Planet. To &s;peak properly and ri|gorou&s;ly, there is &s;ome rea&s;on we &s;hould comply with the &s;en|timent of <HI>Aco&s;ta;</HI> yet ina&s;much as not only the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but al&s;o many other Nations, expre&s;s them&s;elves otherwi&s;e, we &s;hall keep to their terms rather, e&s;pecially in a thing of &s;o little con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But how rainy &s;oever this Sea&s;on may be in the <HI>Carribies,</HI> tho&s;e who have liv'd there &s;everal years affirm, that there hard|ly pa&s;&s;es a day, but the Sun is &s;een. The &s;ame thing is &s;aid of the I&s;land of <HI>Rhodes;</HI> whence Antiquity dedicated it to the Sun, out of an imagination, that that Star had a particular care of it.</P>
<P>The Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea is regulated in the&s;e Countries, as in our parts; but it ri&s;es not above three or four foot at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the&s;e I&s;lands are cover'd with &s;everal &s;orts of excellent Woods, which being green at all times, afford a very delightful pro&s;pect, and repre&s;ent a perpetual Summer.</P>
<P>The Soil, in mo&s;t places, is as rich and as pregnant as in any part of <HI>France;</HI> In&s;omuch that all tho&s;e I&s;lands that are inhabited give not the Inhabitants any occa&s;ion to repent them of the pains they take. In which particular, they differ much from tho&s;e Countries of <HI>New-France,</HI> where the poor Sa|vages are &s;o put to it to get their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, that their Chil|dren, going out of their Hutts in the morning, and finding their Parents a hunting, are wont to cry out as loud as they can, <HI>Come Tatous; come Ca&s;tors; come Orignacs;</HI> calling thus to the relief of their nece&s;&s;ities tho&s;e creatures, which yet come not in their &s;ight as often as they &s;tand in need thereof.</P>
<P>The &s;ame inhabited I&s;lands are al&s;o furni&s;hed with good &s;ources of fre&s;h Water, Springs, Lakes, Brooks, Wells and Ci&s;terns, and &s;ome of them have fair Rivers. There are fur|ther in &s;everal places Mineral-waters, which are &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed, in order to the curing of divers Di&s;ea&s;es. Brim&s;tone is got out of the bowels of the Mountains in divers places; and the bright &s;ilver &s;pangles which the Torrents and Rivers bring down along with them, and are found in the &s;and, and the froth of their waters, after they have been over-flown, are certain <HI>indicia</HI> and di&s;coveries, that there is Cry&s;tal to be had in them, and that there are al&s;o Mines of tho&s;e precious Metals, which are &s;o much &s;ought after by mo&s;t men.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7" MS="y">Tho&s;e running waters, which de&s;erve the name of Rivers, are never dry'd up, even in the greate&s;t droughts, and ex|treamly well &s;tor'd with Fi&s;h, for the mo&s;t part different from tho&s;e &s;een in <HI>Europe.</HI> But there is &s;uch abundance on the Sea|coa&s;ts, that the Inhabitants will hardly take the pains to fi&s;h in the Rivers.</P>
<P>The Vine thrives very well in the&s;e I&s;lands, and, be&s;ides a wild kind of Vine they have, which grows naturally in the Woods, and bears a very fair and large Grape, there are in all the Inhabited ones great Gardens, with the Walks &s;et about with Vines; nay in &s;ome places perfect Vine-yards, as tho&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> which bear twice a year, and &s;ometimes oftener, ac|cording to the cultivation be&s;tow'd on them, with re&s;pect had to the Moon and conveniency of the Sea&s;ons. The Grape is excellent good, but the Wine made of it will not keep many days; and therefore there is but little of it made.</P>
<P>As for Wheat, which grows in <HI>New-Spain</HI> as well as in any place of the World, it grows no further then the blade in the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> and is only for the making of Green-&s;auce, in re|gard that Grain requires winter, and the &s;oil there being too rank, it &s;hoots forth too much at fir&s;t, and there is not &s;trength enough left in the root to force it to &s;taulk and knit in the ear. But if tryal were made of the &s;owing of Barley and Rye, and other Grains which require heat, its probable they would thrive well. And yet, &s;hould they come to maturity, and with great increa&s;e, the Inhabitants, being at little trouble to get <HI>Manyoc, Potatoes, Turkey-wheat,</HI> and &s;everal kinds of Pul&s;e, would not take the pains to put them into the ground.</P>
<P>All the natural Provi&s;ions of the&s;e I&s;lands are light, and of ea&s;ie dige&s;tion; in regard the Country being hot, the &s;tomack ought not to be burthened, as may be pre&s;umed in colder Cli|mates. Upon this account it is, that &s;uch as are newly come into the&s;e parts are advis'd to eat little, and often. Nor doth what is eaten breed much blood, and therefore Phlebotomy is not much u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands are inhabited by four different Nations; where|of the fir&s;t are the <HI>Indigenae,</HI> or <HI>Originary Inhabitants,</HI> who have lived there time out of mind; and the&s;e are the <HI>Caribbians</HI> or <HI>Cannibals,</HI> of whom we &s;hall give a perfect accompt in the Second Book of this Hi&s;tory. The other three are the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e fo|reign Nations in tho&s;e parts happen'd about the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred twenty five, &s;ince which time they have &s;o encreas'd, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> are now be|come a very numerous people; as will be &s;een more at large in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>THat we may ob&s;erve &s;ome order in the De&s;cription we intend of each of the&s;e I&s;lands in particular, we &s;hall divide them into three Cla&s;&s;es; whereof the fir&s;t &s;hall comprehend tho&s;e which lye towards the South, and are neere&s;t the Line; the &s;econd tho&s;e which lye Northward; and the la&s;t, tho&s;e which are commonly called the Lee-ward I&s;lands, which reach We&s;tward from St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> the be&s;t known of them all.</P>

<HEAD>TABAGO.</HEAD>
<P>THe fir&s;t, and mo&s;t Southerly of all the <HI>Caribbies</HI> is <HI>Tabago,</HI> or <HI>Tabac,</HI> di&s;tant from the Equinoctial Northward eleven degrees and &s;ixteen minutes. It is about eight leagues in length, and four in breadth. There are in it &s;everal plea&s;ant Mountains, out of which ari&s;e eighteen Springs or &s;mall Rivers, which, having drench'd the Plains, fall into the Sea. It is con|ceiv'd the air of it would be healthy enough, if the Trees were cut down, and the ground opened.</P>
<P>The extraordinary height of the Trees growing in this I&s;land argue the fruitfulne&s;s of its &s;oil. There are in this the five kinds of four footed creatures, whereof there are but one or two in any of the other I&s;lands. As 1. a kind of <HI>Swine,</HI> not much furni&s;h'd with bri&s;tles, which have a certain hole on their backs. 2. <HI>Tatous. 3. Agoutis. 4. Opa&s;&s;ums,</HI> and 5. <HI>Musk-Rats,</HI> all which we &s;hall de&s;cribe in their proper place. Not to mention the Wood-Qui&s;ts, Turtles, Partridges, and Parrats, which are commonly &s;een there, it affords abundance of other Birds, not known in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea which encompa&s;&s;es this I&s;land is abundantly fur|ni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of excellent Fi&s;h. Sea-Tortoi&s;es come in multitudes to hide their Egges in the &s;and, which lyes on the &s;hoars. On the We&s;t and North &s;ide of it there are Bayes, where Ships may &s;afely Anchor.</P>
<P>About &s;ixteen years &s;ince, a Company of Burghers of <HI>Walcre</HI> in <HI>Zealand</HI> &s;ent thither 200 men, to plant a Colony there, under the States-General of the United Provinces, and call'd the I&s;land, the <HI>New-Walcre.</HI> But the natural Inhabitants of the Country, fearing the Neighbourhood of tho&s;e Foreigners, ma&s;&s;acred &s;ome of them, which forc'd the re&s;t, who were troubled with &s;ickne&s;s and feared the treatment their compani|ons had receiv'd, to retire el&s;ewhere. Whereupon the I&s;land

<P>This I&s;land lying next to the Continent of that part of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> which lyes Southward, lyes very convenient for a Com|merce with the <HI>Arovagues,</HI> the <HI>Calibis,</HI> the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and &s;e|veral other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations; and the keeping together of a con&s;iderable force of men, which might be ea&s;ily &s;ent over in|to the Continent, and lay the foundations of a powerful Colony.</P>

The French became ma&s;ters of it about &s;ix years &s;ince. They had at the beginning great con|te&s;tations with the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who, for &s;ome moneths, di&s;put|ed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it with them by force of arms. But at la&s;t Mon&s;ieue <HI>Parquet,</HI> Governour of <HI>Martinico,</HI> who had re&s;olv'd, at his own charge, to make an e&s;tabli&s;hment there, oblig'd them, out of a con&s;ideration of their own concernments, grounded principally on the great advantages they received from the Neighbourhood of the French, to leave him quietly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it.</P>
<P>The ground produces all manner of the Country provi&s;ions, as Sugar-Canes, Ginger, and excellent Tobacco. The air is very healthy.

It hath al&s;o abun|dance of fair Trees, &s;ome excellent for their fruit, others for their fitne&s;s for building. There is good Fi&s;hing all about it, and the Inhabitants have al&s;o good Fi&s;hing and Hunting in and about three little I&s;lands, called the <HI>Granadines,</HI> lying North-Ea&s;t from it.

It is about &s;ixteen leagues in length, of an unequal breadth, and about forty five in compa&s;s. The Soil of it is plea&s;ant, which makes it at this day one of the mo&s;t populous of all the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> are joyntly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it, and have
<PB N="10" REF="10" MS="y">
liv'd a long time in very good corre&s;pondence. Mon&s;. <HI>Parquet</HI> is the pre&s;ent French Governour of it.</P>
<P>Of all the <HI>Caribbies</HI> this is the mo&s;t uneven I&s;land, that is, the mo&s;t full of Mountains, which are very high, and intermixt with inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks. The fruitful parts of it con&s;i&s;t in certain round Hills or eminences; as al&s;o in very delightful &s;kirts of Mountains, and &s;ome Plains or Valleys, which are ex|treamly plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The Mountains of it are not to be inhabited, and &s;erve for the feeding and retreat of wild Bea&s;ts, Serpents and Snakes, whereof there is great abundance. Yet are the&s;e Mountains well furni&s;h'd with wood, which, in bigne&s;s and length, ex|ceed any in <HI>Europe,</HI> and bears fruit and food for the wild Boars and Birds.</P>
<P>As for the Hills and &s;kirts of Mountains, they are for the mo&s;t part, inhabitable; and of a good &s;oil, but very trouble|&s;ome to manure. For &s;ome of them are &s;o high and &s;teepy, that people can hardly work on them without danger, or at lea&s;t without holding by a Tobacco-&s;talk, or &s;ome Tree with one hand, that they may work with the other.</P>
<P>The Tobacco which grows on the&s;e eminent places is ever the be&s;t, and e&s;teem'd above that which grows in the Valleys, and bottoms, which have not &s;o much pre&s;ence of the Sun. For the Tobacco, which grows in bottoms, and places encom|pa&s;s'd with Woods, is ever full of yellow-&s;pots, as if it were burnt, and neither takes well, nor keeps well. The&s;e enclo&s;ed places are al&s;o unhealthy, and tho&s;e who work in them con|tract an ill colour, and the new-comers, who are not accu|&s;tomed to that air, do &s;ooner, in the&s;e, then in any other places, catch that griping of the Belly, which is &s;o common in the&s;e I&s;lands.</P>
<P>There being two different Nations in this I&s;land, it is accord|ingly divided between them, to wit, the <HI>Indians,</HI> the natural Inhabitants of the Country; and the <HI>French,</HI> who laid the foundations of this Colony in <HI>July,</HI> in the year 1635. under the Conduct of Mon&s;. <HI>De&s;nambuc,</HI> who brought them from St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> and left them in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place.</P>
<P>That part of the I&s;land which is inhabited by the Indians is comprehended in one quarter, which is called the <HI>Cabes-terre,</HI> without any other di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The part occupied by the <HI>French,</HI> and called <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre,</HI> is divided into five quarters, which are by them called, <HI>La Ca&s;e du Pilote, La Ca&s;e Capot, Le Carbet, Le Fort St. Pierre,</HI> and <HI>Le Pre&s;cheur.</HI> In each of the&s;e Quarters there is a Church, or at lea&s;t a Chappel, a Court of Guard, and a Magazine for Arms, about which are built &s;everal large and fair Store-hou&s;es, both for the Commodities that are imported, and tho&s;e of the growth of the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">The Quarter of the <HI>Ca&s;e du Pilote</HI> is &s;o called from a Savage Captain, who had &s;ometimes lived there, and glory'd much in the name <HI>Pilot,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had given him. He di&s;co|ver'd to Mon&s;. <HI>Parquet,</HI> the engagements which tho&s;e of his Nation entred into again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In the Quarter of <HI>Ca&s;e Capot,</HI> there is a very noble <HI>Savanna,</HI> (thus they call in the I&s;lands plea&s;ant Meadows and Pa&s;tures) which hath, on the one &s;ide the River called <HI>Capot,</HI> and on the other, many fair Edifices.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carbet</HI> Quarter hath its name from the ancient Inhabi|tants, who &s;ometime had there one of their greate&s;t Villages, and a publick Hou&s;e which they called <HI>Carbet,</HI> a name yet common to tho&s;e places, where they have their meetings. The French Governour liv'd in this Quarter a long time, ha|ving built a noble Brick-hou&s;e, neer the Haven, in a plea&s;ant bottom, refre&s;h'd by a con&s;iderable River, which falls down out of the Mountains. The Indians, who never had &s;een Stru|cture of any &s;uch material, look'd on it at fir&s;t with a great a&s;toni&s;hment, and having attempted to &s;hake it, by the &s;trength of their &s;houlders, but not &s;tirring it, they were forc'd acknowledg, that if all Hou&s;es were &s;o built, the Tempe&s;t which they call the <HI>Hurricane</HI> would not prejudice them. But &s;ince, the Governour not having his health perfectly there, he made a pre&s;ent of it to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> together with the Gardens about it, as al&s;o the rarities and curio&s;ities of the Country, and &s;everal other habitations dependent on it, and a great number of Negro-&s;laves, who cultivate them.</P>
<P><HI>Fort St. Pierre,</HI> or St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort, is the place where the Governour now lives. There are in it &s;everal great pieces of Cannon, &s;ome of Bra&s;s, &s;ome of Iron. This Fort commands all the Haven. About a &s;tones ca&s;t from the Governours, &s;tands the fair Colledge of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> &s;ituate on a plea&s;ant River, which is thence called, <HI>The Jesuits River.</HI> This Structure is of Free-&s;tone and Brick, very delightful to the eye. The Ave|nues al&s;o want not their temptation, and, all about it, are Gardens and Orchards, producing whatever is mo&s;t delicious of the growth of the I&s;lands; as al&s;o &s;everal Plants, Herbs, Flowers and Fruits brought thither from <HI>France.</HI> There is al|&s;o a Vine-yard, which yields yearly good &s;tore of Wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Le Pre&s;cheur,</HI> or the Preachers Quarter, contains an even low part of the Country, very con&s;iderable for its extent, and &s;everal high Mountains, upon the &s;kirts whereof, there are a good number of fair Habitations.</P>
<P>Between the <HI>Cabes-terre,</HI> and the <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre,</HI> there is a kind of bottom, where is abundance of that Wood by which the Tobacco climes up. There they have al&s;o the Reeds, where|with the Hutts are Pali&s;ado'd; as al&s;o the wild <HI>Mahot,</HI> the bark whereof &s;erves for &s;everal things about the hou&s;e.</P>

That advantageous &s;ituation con|tributes much to their health who live in them, for the air is clearer then that of the Valleys. It al&s;o adds much to the beauty of tho&s;e plea&s;ant Structures; and cau&s;es a very diver|tive pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Haven of this I&s;land lyes between <HI>Carbet</HI> and St. <HI>Peters</HI> Fort. It is more &s;afe then any of the neighbouring I&s;lands, as being encompa&s;s'd with high Mountains, which &s;e|cure the Ships lying in it from the violence of all winds.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Ca&s;e du Pilote,</HI> and a bottom called <HI>Culde Sac des Salines,</HI> there is a Rock, running about half a league into the Sea, which is called the <HI>Diamond,</HI> from its figure, and is a retreat for an infinite number of Birds, and among others Wood-qui&s;ts, which breed in it. It is hard getting up to it, yet &s;ome vi&s;it it, as they pa&s;s by, when the young ones are fit to eat.</P>
<P>There is another place on the &s;ame &s;ide as the <HI>Diamond,</HI> into which Ships are brought, to be refre&s;h'd, and mended. The Sea there is always calm, but the air not healthy, in regard the Sea-men commonly catch Fevers, which yet are not very dangerous, ina&s;much as they &s;hake them off, as &s;oon as they depart thence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Torrents, which in times of rains fall down with great violence, and the inundations of this I&s;land, there are nine or ten con&s;iderable Rivers which are never dry. Their &s;ources are at the a&s;cent or foot of the highe&s;t Mountains, and having watered the Valleys they fall into the Sea. They are prejudicial to the places neer them, in regard that when they overflow, they root up Trees, undermine rocks, and make a de&s;olation over the Fields and Gardens, carrying along with them, the hou&s;es which lye in the plain Country, and what|ever oppo&s;es the impetuo&s;ity of their cour&s;e. This inconve|nience hath oblig'd the Inhabitants of this Colony to take up their habitations on the tops of tho&s;e little Mountains, where|with their I&s;land is richly furni&s;h'd; for they &s;ecure them from the&s;e inundations.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t con&s;iderable in this I&s;land, is the multitude of the Inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, who are thought to amount to nine or ten thou&s;and per&s;ons, not comprehending in that num|ber the Indians and Negroes, who are neer as many.

<P>Among the great multitude of people which make up this Colony, there are many per&s;ons of worth and quality, who after their honorable imployments in other parts of the world, have at la&s;t made choice of this place, for their repo&s;e and re|tirement. Among the&s;e are particularly to be mentioned Mon&s;. <HI>Courcelas,</HI> Lieutenant-General under the Governor, a per&s;on who by his excellent conduct hath gain'd the affections of both Inhabitants and Strangers; Mon&s;. <HI>Le Comte,</HI> and Mon&s;. <HI>de L' Oubiere,</HI> as being the principal Officers.</P>
<P>At the beginning of our De&s;cription of this I&s;land, we &s;aid, that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> lived there a long time toge|ther in good corre&s;pondence. But the Letters that came thence lately, giving an account of the &s;tate of it, affirm, that about four years &s;ince, the <HI>Caribbians</HI> made an in&s;urrection, and have continued a War with the French ever &s;ince; that &s;ince that time, tho&s;e Barbarians had done great mi&s;chiefs in the French Quarters; and that neither the height of the Moun|tains, nor depth of the precipices, nor yet the horror of va&s;t and dreadful &s;olitudes, which till then had been accounted an impenetrable wall, lying between the &s;everal divi&s;ions of both the Nations, hindred not their falling upon them, and filling their habitations with fire, ma&s;&s;acres, de&s;olation, and what|ever the implacable &s;pirit of revenge could &s;ugge&s;t to them of greate&s;t cruelty, to feed their rage, and &s;atisfie their bru|tality.</P>
<P>Of the occa&s;ions of this Rupture there are &s;everal accounts given. Some attribute it to Mon&s;. <HI>Parquet</HI>'s e&s;tabli&s;hing of <HI>French</HI> Colonies in the I&s;lands of <HI>Granada</HI> and St. <HI>Lucy,</HI> with|out the con&s;ent of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who thereupon took occa|&s;ion of di&s;content. Others affirm that they took up Arms, to revenge the deaths of &s;ome of their Nation, Inhabitants of the I&s;land of S. <HI>Vincent,</HI> whom they believe to have come to their end by drinking &s;ome poi&s;on'd Strong-water which had been brought them from <HI>Martinico.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately upon the breaking forth of this War, and the fir&s;t deva&s;tations made by the <HI>Caribbians</HI> in one of the <HI>French</HI> Quarters (which, according to their cu&s;tom, was by a ba&s;e &s;ur|pri&s;e) tho&s;e who envy'd the glory of tho&s;e Colonies, and their progre&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;hment in tho&s;e I&s;lands, &s;cattered their ma|licious reports, That the <HI>French</HI> would never be able to keep

<P>It is not certainly known whether there were really any &s;uch A&s;&s;ociation again&s;t them or not; but certain it is, that the ef|fects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">of it appear'd not; and that after the fir&s;t Irruptions of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of <HI>Martinico</HI> into the <HI>French</HI> Quarters, which were indeed with &s;ome advantage of the Barbarians, they have been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in their Enterpri&s;es &s;ince, and wor&s;ted &s;o with the lo&s;s of the chief among&s;t them, that about two years &s;ince they were forc'd to quit their Villages, and leave their Gardens to the di&s;po&s;al of the Victorious, and retire for &s;afety into Woods, and inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks and Mountains.

He was engag'd to give it this name from a con|&s;ideration of the figure of its Mountains, the I&s;land having on its upper part, as it were upon one of its &s;houlders, another le&s;|&s;er Mountain, as S^t <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> is painted like a Gyant, carry|ing our Saviour upon his, as it were a little Child. Its altitude is at 17 degrees, 25 minutes.</P>
<P>It is about 25 leagues in compa&s;s. The Soil being light and &s;andy, is apt to produce all &s;orts of the Country Fruits, as al|&s;o many of the choice&s;t growing in <HI>Europe.</HI> It lyes high in the mid&s;t, by rea&s;on of &s;ome very high Mountains, out of which ari&s;e &s;everal Rivers, which &s;ometimes are &s;o &s;uddenly over|flown through the rains falling on the Mountains, &s;o as that there is none &s;een at the extremities of them, or in the Plains, that the Inhabitants are many times &s;urpriz'd by tho&s;e Torrents.</P>
<P>The whole I&s;land is divided into four Cantons, or Quar|ters, two whereof are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the other two by the <HI>French;</HI> but in &s;uch &s;ort, as that people cannot cro&s;s from one quarter to the other, without pa&s;&s;ing over Lands of one of the two Nations. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have in their part a great|er number of little Rivers then the <HI>French;</HI> but in requital, the latter have more of the plain Country, and Lands fitter for cultivation. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> al&s;o exceed the <HI>French</HI> in num|ber; but the latter have more fortified places, and are better armed. The <HI>French</HI> have four Forts, well furni&s;h'd with great Pieces, which carry a great way into the Sea; and one of them hath regular works, like a Citadel. The mo&s;t con&s;i|derable next that lyes at the Haven, or Anchoring-place, cal|led <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre.</HI> There is in both a con&s;tant Guard kept: And to prevent the differences which might happen between two different Nations, each of them upon the Avenues of their Quarters hath a Guard which is, renew'd every day. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have two fortifi'd places, whereof one commands the great Haven, and the other a De&s;cent, not far from <HI>Pointe de Sable.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land is furni&s;h'd with a fair Salt-pit, lying on the Sea|&s;ide, which the Inhabitants commonly call <HI>Cul-de-Sac.</HI> Not
<PB N="22" REF="16">
far thence, there is a &s;mall Point of Land, which reaches out &s;o far towards the I&s;land of <HI>Nieves,</HI> that it is not above half a league of Sea between the two, in&s;omuch that there have been tho&s;e who have &s;wam from one to the other.</P>
<P>It is conceiv'd there is a Silver-mine in St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers;</HI> but in regard the Salt-pits, Woods, Havens, and Mines are com|mon to both Nations, no body looks after it: Be&s;ides, &s;uch an enterpri&s;e would require a great &s;tock, and an infinite num|ber of Slaves. The true Silver-mine of this I&s;land is Sugar.</P>
<P>A man may ea&s;ily compa&s;s the whole I&s;land by Land, but cannot pa&s;s through the mid&s;t of it, by rea&s;on of &s;everal great and &s;teepy Mountains, between which there are dread|ful precipices, and &s;prings of hot water: Nay there are &s;ome &s;prings of Sulphur, which hath occa&s;ion'd one of them to be called, the <HI>Sulphur-Mountain.</HI> Taking the Circumference from without, the body of the I&s;land &s;eems to extend it &s;elf, by a gentle de&s;cent, down to the Sea-&s;ide, and is of an une|qual breadth, according as the Mountains dilate their &s;kirts more or le&s;s towards the Sea, or the more the Sea advances, and forces the land again&s;t the Mountains. The Soil, as far as it is cultivated, that is, to the &s;teepy a&s;cent of the Mountains, is divided in a manner about into &s;everal &s;tages or &s;tories, through which there are drawn fair and &s;pacious ways, in a &s;trait-line, as much as the places would permit. The fir&s;t of the&s;e lines of communication begins at about a hundred paces from the Sea-&s;ide; another three or four hundred paces high|er, and &s;o a&s;cending to the third or fourth, whence a man may take a very plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of all the Plantations from thence downwards.</P>
<P>Every Stage, which makes a kind of girdle, or enclo&s;ure, great|er or le&s;&s;er about the Mountains, according to the greater or le&s;|&s;er di&s;tance of it from the Mountains, hath al&s;o its ways, which like &s;o many cro&s;&s;ing &s;treets afford an ea&s;ie acce&s;s to tho&s;e who live higher or lower; and this with &s;uch a noble &s;ymme|try, that when a man compa&s;&s;es the I&s;land by Sea, he cannot imagine any thing more delightful, then to &s;ee that plea&s;ing verdure of &s;o many Trees, which are planted along the high|ways, and are the divi&s;ions between the &s;everal Plantations. The pro&s;pect is &s;uch, that the eye can hardly be wearied with it: If it be directed upwards, it is terminated by tho&s;e high Mountains, which are crown'd with a perpetual verdure, and cloath'd with precious Woods: If downwards, it is enter|tain'd by the delightful pro&s;pect of Gardens, which taken in from tho&s;e places where the Mountains are inacce&s;&s;ible, are thence by a gentle and ea&s;ie de&s;cent continu'd to the Sea|&s;ide. The delightful bright-green of the Tobacco, planted exactly by the line, the pale-yellow of the Sugar-Canes, when come to maturity, and the dark-green of Ginger and
<PB N="23" REF="16">
Potatoes, make &s;o delightful a Land&s;kip, as mu&s;t cau&s;e an ex|traordinary recreation to the unwearied eye. What very much adds to this delight, is, that in the mid&s;t of every Plan|tation, or Garden, there may be &s;een &s;everal fair hou&s;es of dif|ferent &s;tructures, particularly tho&s;e which are cover'd with red or glaz'd &s;late, contribute a greater lu&s;tre to that plea&s;ant per|&s;pective. And in regard there is a perpetual a&s;cent in the I&s;land, the lower &s;tage or &s;tory deprives not the &s;ight of the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the pro&s;pect of that which lyes at a greater di|&s;tance; but a man may at one gra&s;p of the eye, as it were in an in&s;tant, behold all tho&s;e delightful divi&s;ions, all tho&s;e ways which look like &s;o many walks of an Orchard, planted with &s;everal &s;orts of Trees; all tho&s;e Gardens regularly be&s;et with divers Fruits; and all tho&s;e Edifices, which for the mo&s;t part are not di&s;tant one from another above a hundred paces. In a word, &s;o many agreeable objects offer them&s;elves to the eye, at the &s;ame intuition, that it is at a kind of lo&s;s on which mo&s;t to fa&s;ten it &s;elf.</P>
<P>There is indeed a certain nece&s;&s;ity, for the greater conveni|ence of the Inhabitants, and ea&s;ier managing of their employ|ments, that their hou&s;es &s;hould be di&s;tinct one from another, and plac'd in the mid&s;t of that piece of ground which they have to manure. The French, be&s;ides the hou&s;es they have thus di&s;pos'd at certain di&s;tances, have, in their Quarter of <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre,</HI> a Town which grows bigger daily, and whereof the Hou&s;es are of Brick and Timber. It lyes neer the Haven, where commonly Ships lye at Anchor. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Inhabitants, and Foreign-Merchants have Store-hou&s;es there.</P>
<P>The French and Dutch Merchants, who re&s;ide there con|&s;tantly, are well furni&s;h'd with excellent Wines, <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> and Beer, all &s;orts of Stuffes, of Silk, or Wooll, fit for the Country, and generally all the refre&s;hments, which being not of the growth of the I&s;land, are yet nece&s;&s;ary for the better accommodation of the Inhabitants. All is &s;old at a rea&s;onable rate, and in exchange for the Commodities growing in the Country. In the &s;ame place live &s;everal &s;orts of Trades-men, who&s;e employments are nece&s;&s;ary to Commerce and civil So|ciety. There is al&s;o a Hall for the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and a fair Church able to contain a very great Congregation: The Structure is of wood, rais'd on a foundation of Free-&s;tone: In&s;tead of Gla&s;s-windows there are only turned Pillars, after the fa&s;hion of a Balcony. It is cover'd with red Slate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capuchins</HI> for &s;ome years had the over&s;ight of the &s;aid Church, and the charge of the Souls, as to the French, over the whole I&s;land: but in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred forty and &s;ix, they were di&s;engag'd from that employment by the unanimous con&s;ent of the Inhabitants, who civilly di&s;mi&s;s'd
<PB N="24" REF="17">
them, and receiv'd in their &s;tead <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>Carmelites,</HI> who have very fair Hou&s;es and Plantations, which are manured by a great number of Slaves belonging to them, through who&s;e means they are very hand&s;omly maintained. The R. F. <HI>Henry du Vivier</HI> was the fir&s;t Superior of the Je&s;uitical Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His Excellency the General hath al&s;o built a very fair Ho|&s;pital, in a very healthy place, where &s;uch &s;ick per&s;ons as are unable to effect their recovery at their own hou&s;es, are at|tended, and maintained, and vi&s;ited by Phy&s;itians and Surge|ons, till they are re&s;tored to their former health. Strangers al|&s;o who fall &s;ick in the I&s;land are receiv'd in there. Order is al|&s;o taken that Orphans be di&s;pos'd into convenient hou&s;es, where they are brought up and in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>There are many noble Structures built both by the the Eng|li&s;h and French; but the mo&s;t magnificent of any is the Ca&s;tle of the French General, the particular De&s;cription whereof we &s;hall neverthele&s;s forbear, in regard it makes not much to the Natural Hi&s;tory oft he <HI>Caribbies.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Engli&s;h building the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are tho&s;e of the late Mr. <HI>Warner,</HI> fir&s;t Governour General of this Nation; Mr. <HI>Rich's,</HI> his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; Mr. <HI>Everard's,</HI> and Col. <HI>Geffrey&s;on's,</HI> which may well be ranked among the mo&s;t noble, and be&s;t ac|compli&s;h'd of any in the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></P>
<P>The Engli&s;h have al&s;o built in this I&s;land five very fair Churches, well furni&s;h'd within with Pulpits, and Seats, of ex|cellent Joyners work, of precious wood. Till the late Times, the Mini&s;ters were &s;ent thither by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbu|ry,</HI> to who&s;e Dioce&s;s it belongs.</P>

<P>ALL the I&s;lands lying We&s;t from St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> are com|monly called the Lee-ward I&s;lands, ina&s;much as the con&s;tant wind of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> is an Ea&s;t-wind, with &s;ome point of the North, and that there is &s;eldom any We&s;t or South-wind.

<P>THe I&s;land of St. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> lyes North-We&s;t from St. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers,</HI> at the altitude of &s;eventeen degrees, and forty minutes. It is about five leagues in compa&s;s. To &s;peak pro|perly,
<PB N="25" REF="17">
it is but a Mountain ri&s;ing up in the mid&s;t of the Ocean, much like a Sugar-loaf, which is thought to be the figure of Mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> and the <HI>Pic</HI> of <HI>Teneriffe,</HI> &s;ave that the la&s;t named is incomparably higher. The Colony inhabiting it, con&s;i&s;t|ing of about &s;ixteen hundred men, acknowledg the Sovereign|ty of the States-General, who have granted the Government of it to Mon&s;. <HI>Van Ree,</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, Merchants of <HI>Flu&s;h|ing</HI> in <HI>Zealand.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land is the &s;tronge&s;t, as to &s;ituation, of all the <HI>Carib|bies,</HI> for there is but one good de&s;cent, which may be ea&s;ily de|fended; &s;o that a few men might keep off a great Army: But be&s;ides this natural Fortification, there is in it a &s;trong Fort which commands the be&s;t Haven, the Guns of it carrying a good di&s;tance into the Sea.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants have neat hou&s;es, and tho&s;e well furni&s;h'd, as their Country-men have in <HI>Holland.</HI> Only the very top of the Mountain is cover'd with Wood; all the compa&s;s is manur'd. It can hardly be credited what quantities of Tobacco it hath heretofore and &s;till doth yield.</P>
<P>Though the top of this Mountain &s;eems to be very picked, yet is there a kind of bottom of a large extent, affording a re|treat to a great number of wild Bea&s;ts. The Inhabitants are very indu&s;trious in keeping on their Lands all &s;orts of Poultry, as al&s;o Swine and Conies, which breed exereamly.</P>
<P>There are no Springs in this I&s;land; but there are now few Hou&s;es but have a good Ci&s;tern to &s;upply that defect: There are al&s;o Store-hou&s;es &s;o well furni&s;h'd with all things requi&s;ite to life, and the accommodation of the Inhabitants, that many times they have wherewith to plea&s;ure their Neighbours. The Inhabitants live decently and Chri&s;tianly, and cannot ju&s;tly be reproach'd with tho&s;e crimes which &s;ome have impos'd upon them. There is in the I&s;land one Church, which hath from time to time been &s;upply'd with very able Pa&s;tors; of whom one was M^r <HI>May,</HI> who, among other Writings, put out a Learned Commentary on the mo&s;t difficult places of the five Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> wherein there are many curious Ob&s;ervations of Na|ture.</P>

<P>THe I&s;land of S. <HI>Martin</HI> lies at the Altitude of 18. degrees and 16 minutes: It is about &s;even Leagues in length, and four in bredth: There are in it excellent Salt-ponds, which had oblig'd the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to build a Fort in it, the better to &s;e|cure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but about nine years &s;ince he demo|li&s;h'd the Fort and quitted the I&s;land: Which being ob&s;erv'd by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Ruyter,</HI> who commanded one of the Ships which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lamp&s;en</HI> commonly &s;ends into <HI>America,</HI> and who then &s;ailed by this I&s;land, he went to S.<HI>Eu&s;tace's</HI> to rai&s;e men, whom he brought thither, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of the States-General.</P>
<P>The news of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> departure thence coming at the &s;ame time to the <HI>French</HI> General, he pre&s;ently di&s;patch'd thither a Ship very well mann'd, to recover the right and preten&s;ions of the <HI>French,</HI> who had been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the &s;aid I&s;land before the u&s;urpation of the <HI>Spaniard:</HI> Since the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have divided it, and live very friendly together. The <HI>French</HI> have there about 300 men. The Salt-ponds are in the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Quarter. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are more in number than the <HI>French: Lamp&s;en</HI> and <HI>Van Ree</HI> are the Directors of the Colony. They have very fair Hou&s;es, large Store-hou&s;es, and a con&s;iderable number of Negroes, who are their perpetual Slaves.</P>
<P>There is no fre&s;h water in this I&s;land, but what when it rains is receiv'd into Ci&s;terns, which are common enough. There are &s;everal little I&s;lands about this, very convenient for the di|verti&s;ements of the Inhabitants. There are al&s;o Ponds of &s;alt water, which run up far into the Land, in which are taken abundance of good Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Sea-Tortoi&s;es. There are in the Woods Wild-Swine, Qui&s;ts, Turtles, and an infinite number of Parrots. There are al&s;o &s;everal Trees, out of which

<HEAD>CITRONS.</HEAD>
<P>OF <HI>Citrons</HI> there are three kinds, different as to bigne&s;s, and which con&s;equently are not all called <HI>Citrons.</HI> The fir&s;t kind, which is the faire&s;t and large&s;t, is called <HI>Lime:</HI> it is on|ly good to be pre&s;erv'd, having very little juyce; but pre&s;erv'd, it is excellent. The &s;econd kind is the <HI>Lemon,</HI> about the big|ne&s;s of the <HI>Citron</HI> brought from <HI>Spain:</HI> but its juyce is little, in compari&s;on of its bulk. The little <HI>Citron,</HI> which makes the third kind, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;teem'd: it hath a very thin &s;kin or pellicle, and is full of a very &s;harp juyce, which gives an excellent ta&s;te to Meats, and a picquancy to &s;everal Sawces: it is a particular Fruit of <HI>America.</HI> Some curious per&s;ons have in their Gardens a kind of very &s;weet <HI>Citrons,</HI> both as to their peel and juyce, which as to bigne&s;s and ta&s;te come not behind tho&s;e which grow in <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>

The Bark of this Tree is very thin and &s;mooth: It &s;hoots forth at the roots &s;everal &s;uckers, which if not taken away, will in time make a thick wood about it, as far as there is any good ground. Its branches, which are thick and well furni&s;h'd with leaves, are loaden twice a year with little white Flowers, which are follow'd by &s;everal green Apples, which become yellow, and of a good &s;mell when they are ripe. This Fruit hath on the top a little po&s;ie like a Crown, and the meat within is either white or red, full of little kernels, like tho&s;e of a <HI>Pomegranate;</HI> whence the Dutch call it the &s;weet <HI>Pomegranate:</HI> It is about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Pearmain,</HI> and ripens in one night.</P>

<HEAD>PAPAYER.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Papayer</HI> is a Tree which grows without boughs, about 15 or 20 foot high, big proportionably to its height, hollow and &s;pongious within, whence it is u&s;ed to convey Springs and Rivulets to diver&s;e places. There are two kinds of it; one commonly found in all the I&s;lands. The leaves of it are divided into three points, much like the leaf of the <HI>Fig-tree:</HI> They are fa&s;tened to long tails, as big as a mans thumbs, and hollow within. They &s;hoot out of the top of the Tree, and bending downwards, they cover &s;everal round fruits, about the bigne&s;s of the great <HI>Quince-pear,</HI> which grow round the boal to which they are fa&s;tened.</P>
<P>The other kind is particular to the I&s;land of <HI>Sante Croix.</HI> It is fairer, and hath more leaves then the former: but what cau&s;es it to be more e&s;teem'd is its Fruit, which is about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Melon,</HI> and of the figure of a womans brea&s;t, whence the <HI>Portughe&s;e</HI> call it <HI>Mamao.</HI></P>
<P>There is this particularly remarkable in the&s;e Trees, that they bring forth new fruits every moneth in the year.

The juice of it dyes a very dark Violet, though it &s;elf be as clear as rock-water: nay when it is applied twice to the &s;ame part of the body which a man would dye, it makes the place appear black.

The tincture this Fruit gives cannot be taken away with Soap; but after nine or ten days it di&s;appears of it &s;elf. The Swine which eat of this fruit when it falls off the Tree, have the fle&s;h and fat of a violet colour, as hath been found by experience. The &s;ame thing hath been ob&s;erv'd in the fle&s;h of Parrots, and other Birds, when they have eaten of it.

<HEAD>ACAJOV.</HEAD>
<P>THere are three kinds of Trees known by the name of <HI>Acajou;</HI> but of tho&s;e, only that we &s;hall here de&s;cribe bears any fruit: 'Tis a Tree of no great height, &s;preading its branches down towards the ground: The leaves of it are fair and large, clo&s;ing to a roundne&s;s before, and divided by certain veins. The flowers of it at the fir&s;t &s;hooting forth are white, but afterwards they become incarnate, and of a purple colour: They grow in tuffes and bu&s;hes, and they &s;end forth &s;o &s;weet a &s;cent, that it is ea&s;ie to di&s;tingui&s;h the Tree which bears them: The&s;e flowers fall not till they are thru&s;t off by a kind of <HI>Che&s;t|nut,</HI> much after the form of an Ear, or a Hares kidney. When this <HI>Che&s;tnut</HI> is come to its growth, there is fram'd under it a very fair Apple, &s;omewhat long, which is crown'd with that as a cre&s;t, which as it ripens becomes of an Olive-colour, while
<PB N="33" REF="21" MS="y">
the Apple puts on a thin delicate skin of a lively Vermilion. Within it is full of certain &s;pungious filaments, which yield a kind of &s;weet and &s;harp juice extreamly good to quench thir&s;t, and accounted very good for the &s;tomach, as al&s;o in &s;woonings and fainting, being qualifi'd with a little Sugar: But if it chance to fall on any Linen, it makes a red &s;tain therein, which continues till &s;uch time as the Tree brings forth new flowers.</P>
<P>The Indians make an excellent drink of this fruit, which being kept &s;ome days inebriates as &s;oon as the be&s;t French|wine would. The Nut which is above, burnt, yields a cau|&s;tick oyl, which is &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed to mollifie, nay to take away Corns, and the callou&s;ne&s;s of the feet. If it be crack'd there is within a kernel, cover'd with a thin pellicle, which being taken away it is of an excellent ta&s;te, and its vertue is to warm and extreamly to fortifie the Stomach.</P>
<P>This Tree bears but once a year; whence the Bra&s;ilians number their age by the Nuts growing on this Apple, laying up one for every year, which they keep very carefully in a little basket for that purpo&s;e. If an inci&s;ion be made at the foot of this Tree there will come forth a clear and tran&s;parent Gum, which many have taken for that which is brought out of <HI>Ara|bia.</HI> The &s;eed of the Tree is in the Nut, which put into the ground grows without any trouble.</P>

The top of it is adorned with &s;everal fair branches chanell'd, and &s;mooth, which have on each &s;ide an in|finite number of leaves, green, long, narrow and very thin, which add much to its beauty.

For if the <HI>Prickly-Palm</HI> before de&s;cribed, afford Wine, this bears on the top of its trunk, and as it were in its heart, a whiti&s;h mar|row or pith, very tender and &s;avory, ta&s;ting like a &s;mall Nut, if eaten raw, and being boiled, and &s;ea&s;oned with the thin and white leaves which encompa&s;s it, and are as it were &s;o much linen about it, it may be numbred among the mo&s;t delicious di&s;hes of the <HI>Caribbies.</HI> The French call that marrowy &s;ub|&s;tance, and the leaves enclo&s;ing it, <HI>Chou de Palmi&s;te,</HI> Palm-Cab|bage, for they put it into the Pot in&s;tead of Cabbage, and other Herbs.</P>
<P>Cleave the trunk of this Tree in two, and take away, as may ea&s;ily be done, a certain filiamental and &s;oft matter, which lyes within, the remaining wood, which is by that means made hollow, and a good inch thick, makes excellent long gutters, which will la&s;t a great while.

It is better furni&s;h'd with branches and leaves then the <HI>Franc-Palm.</HI> The I&s;lands of <HI>Monaca</HI> and <HI>Routam,</HI> at the Gulf of <HI>Hondures,</HI> are famous for their abounding with the&s;e Trees. The I&s;land of S. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> have al&s;o of them, and thence they were brought to S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers.</HI></P>
<P>The fruit grows upon the very trunk, at the &s;hooting forth of the branches. It hath the form of a Nut, but is without compari&s;on much bigger; for one of them &s;ometimes weighs
<PB N="38" REF="24" MS="y">
about ten pound. From the fir&s;t bearing the Tree is never found without fruit, for it bears new every moneth. The &s;hell is &s;o hard and thick that it may be poli&s;h'd, and figures en|grav'd upon it, and made into Cups, Bottles, and other Ve&s;|&s;els. It is encompa&s;s'd with a thick covering which is all of filaments.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Coco-nut</HI> is opened, there is fir&s;t met with a meat, white as &s;now, which is extreamly nouri&s;hing, and ta&s;tes like an <HI>Almond:</HI> There is &s;o much of this marrowy &s;ub&s;tance in every fruit as may well fill an ordinary di&s;h. It is very firm|ly fa&s;tened within the &s;hell, and in the mid&s;t of it there is a large gla&s;s full of liquor, clear and plea&s;ant as perfum'd Wine: &s;o that a man may be well &s;atisfi'd with one of the&s;e fruits at a meal. It is only this water which is turned into &s;eed, and among other vertues hath that of clearing the face of all wrinkles, and giving it a bright and Vermilion colour, &s;o it be wa&s;hed therewith as &s;oon as the fruit is fallen from the Tree.</P>
<P>Who de&s;ires a particular account of the <HI>Cocos</HI> and its u&s;es, as well in Phy&s;ick as Hou&s;e-keeping, may read the large de&s;crip|tion of it made by <HI>Francis Pyrard,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of the Ani|mals, Trees, and Fruits of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Some from the neerne&s;s of the names do &s;ometimes confound the <HI>Cocos</HI> with the <HI>Cacao,</HI> which grows in the Province of <HI>Gua|timala,</HI> neer <HI>New-Spain,</HI> which is al&s;o a famous fruit all over <HI>America,</HI> for its being the principal ingredient in the compo&s;i|tion called <HI>Chocolate.</HI> This drink taken moderately cau&s;eth Venery, Procreation and Conception, and facilitates Delive|ry, pre&s;erves Health, and impinguates: It helpeth Dige&s;tion, Con&s;umption and Cough of the Lungs, Plague of the Guts, and other Fluxes, the Green-Sickne&s;s, Jaundi&s;e, and all man|ner of Imflammations and Oppilations: It clean&s;eth the Teeth, and &s;weetneth Breath, provokes Urine, cures Stone and Stran|gury, expells Poy&s;on, and pre&s;erves from all infectious Di&s;|ea&s;es; all which vertues are attributed to it by &s;everal credita|ble Authors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cacao</HI> which was to be &s;een in the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred forty nine, in a Garden of an Inhabi|tant of the I&s;land of <HI>Sante Croix,</HI> which was then in the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> is a Tree much like an <HI>Orange-tree,</HI> &s;ave that it grows not up &s;o high, and that it hath larger leaves. It is com|monly planted in &s;hady places, even under other Trees, that they may keep off the heat of the Sun from it, which might otherwi&s;e occa&s;ion the withering of its leaves. Its fruit is about the bigne&s;s and neer the figure of an <HI>Acorn,</HI> or a middle &s;iz'd <HI>Olive,</HI> and grows in great long cods, or hu&s;ks, which are &s;treaked in &s;everal places with little partitions along the &s;ides.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Trees fit for Building, Joyners-Work, and Dying.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto given an account of tho&s;e Trees, who&s;e Fruits contribute to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and re|fre&s;hment of the Inhabitants: we &s;hall now treat of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in order to the Building of Hou&s;es, and Furni&s;hing of them by the help of the Joyner. Which done, we &s;hall &s;peak of all tho&s;e other Trees of &s;everal co|lours, whereof the Dyer may make u&s;e in his Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ACAJOU.</HEAD>
<P>THere are few of the I&s;lands but afford good Trees for the Carpenters and Joyners-Work. Of the&s;e one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the <HI>Acajou,</HI> which grows to that exce&s;&s;ive height, that the <HI>Caribbians</HI> will of one trunk make tho&s;e long Shallops called <HI>Pyrages,</HI> which are able to carry fifty men. It &s;hoots forth many branches which grow very clo&s;e together, by rea&s;on of the abundance of leaves they are loaden with. The &s;hade of this Tree is very delightful; nay &s;ome affirm that it contributes to their Health who repo&s;e them&s;elves under it.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Acajou,</HI> which differ only in the height of the trunk, and colour of the wood. The wood of the mo&s;t e&s;teem'd is red, light, of a good &s;cent, and ea&s;ily wrought. It hath been found by experience that it receives no prejudice from the Worm; that it rots not in the water when it hath been cut in &s;ea&s;on; and that the Che&s;ts and Cabinets made of it communicate a good &s;cent too, and &s;ecure the Cloaths kept in them from Vermine, which either breed in, or get into tho&s;e made of other wood. Hence &s;ome have ima|gin'd it to be a kind of <HI>Cedar:</HI> There are al&s;o made of it Shin|gles for the covering of Hou&s;es. Some Ma&s;ters of Ships who Trade to the <HI>Caribbies</HI> many times bring thence Planks of this wood, which are of &s;uch length and breadth that there needs but one to make a fair and large Table.</P>
<P>The other kind of <HI>Acajou</HI> is of the &s;ame figure, as to the out|&s;ide, as that before de&s;cribed; but it grows not up &s;o high, and the bark and pith taken away, the wood is white: Newly fell'd it is very ea&s;ily wrought; but left abroad in the air, it grows &s;o hard that there can hardly be any u&s;e made of it. The Inhabitants u&s;e it only for want of other, becau&s;e it is &s;ub|ject to worms, and putrifies in a &s;hort time. If an inci&s;ion be
<PB N="40" REF="25">
made in the trunks of the&s;e Trees, they will yield abundance of Gum, whereof there might be a good u&s;e made, if any tryal had been made of it.</P>

<HEAD>ACOMAS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Acomas</HI> is a Tree grows up to the height and bulk of the <HI>Acajou,</HI> and is no le&s;s e&s;teem'd by Carpenters and Joyners. Its leaves are &s;mooth and long enough: It bears a fruit of the bigne&s;s of a Plumb, which come to maturity, is of a yellow colour, plea&s;ant to the eye, but too bitter to be mans|meat. The Wood-Qui&s;ts grow fat on it at a certain time of the year, and during that time, their fle&s;h is of the &s;ame ta&s;te as the fruit they have eaten. The bark is of an A&s;h-colour, and very rough, the wood heavy and ea&s;ily poli&s;h'd, and ac|cording to the places where it grows, the heart of it is red, or yellowi&s;h, or inclining to violet. If the bark be opened, there will come forth a milky liquor, which grows hard like Gum.</P>

<P>THe wood called <HI>Ro&s;e-wood</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">it not only for the Car|penter, but al&s;o for the Joyner; and therefore is num|bred among the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. And here we cannot but acknowledg, that if the ancient Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> had any de&s;ign to make a firm &s;etlement of them&s;elves there, they might find not only things requi&s;ite for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, but al&s;o delicacies and curio&s;ities, as well in order to their nouri&s;hment and cloathing, as to the building of their Hou&s;es, and the furni&s;hing of them when they are built. But the flat|tering imaginations of a return into the place of their birth, whereof mo&s;t have their hearts full, induce them to a neglect of all tho&s;e con&s;iderable advantages which the&s;e I&s;lands pre|&s;ent them withall, and an indifferency, if not a contempt, for that abundance of precious things which they &s;o liberally pro|duce. For not to &s;ay any thing at pre&s;ent how ea&s;ily they might makes Stuffes of the Cotton growing here; how they might keep all &s;orts of Fowl, and tame Cattel, which breed there as abundantly as in any place in the World, they might, no doubt, enrich them&s;elves very much by &s;everal &s;orts of precious wood, through the Trade they might drive into &s;e|veral parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ince they think not fit to make u&s;e of them in order to the better accommodation of their habitati|ons. The de&s;cription we &s;hall make of &s;ome of the&s;e rare Trees in this and the next Chapter will make good this Pro|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, as we &s;aid before, the <HI>Ro&s;e-wood</HI> is to be ranked among the chiefe&s;t. This Tree grows to a height proporti|onable
<PB N="41" REF="25">
to its bigne&s;s. The trunk of it is commonly &s;o &s;trait, that it is one of the greate&s;t ornaments of the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Fore&s;ts. It is cover'd with many fair boughs, and tho&s;e loaden with &s;oft leaves, downy on one &s;ide, and neer as long as tho&s;e of a Wall|nut-tree. During the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains it bears white flow|ers, of a good &s;cent, which growing in bu&s;hes, or as it were Po&s;ies, add very much to the natural beauty of the Tree. The&s;e flowers are follow'd by a &s;mall blacki&s;h and &s;mooth &s;eed. The bark of the boal is of a whiti&s;h-grey: The wood within is of the colour of a dead leaf, and when the Smoothing-plane and Poli&s;her hath pa&s;s'd upon it, there may be &s;een &s;everal veins of different colours, waving up and down, which gives it a lu&s;tre, as if it were marbled: But the &s;weet &s;cent it ca&s;ts forth while it is handled and wrought cau&s;es it to be the more e&s;teem'd, and procur'd it the name it is now known by. Some have imagin'd, that that &s;weet &s;cent, which indeed is more plea|&s;ant then that of a Ro&s;e, &s;hould have given it the name of <HI>Cy|prian-wood,</HI> and indeed in &s;ome parts of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> it pa&s;&s;es under that denomination. This Tree grows in all the I&s;lands after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, as to the external figure; but the wood of it is marbled with divers colours, according to the difference of the &s;oil where it had its production and growth.</P>

<HEAD>INDIAN-WOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Indian-wood</HI> is al&s;o a precious Tree, and of good &s;cent: Of this there is &s;uch abundance in the I&s;land of <HI>S. Croix,</HI> and &s;everal others, that there are in them whole Fo|re&s;ts of it. It is not inferior to the <HI>Ro&s;e-wood,</HI> but grows big|ger and higher when it meets with good ground. The roots of it &s;pread them&s;elves very deep into the ground, and the trunk is very &s;trait: The bark is &s;mooth, thin, and even all over, of a bright &s;ilver-grey colour, and in &s;ome places inclining to yel|low, which is a di&s;tinction between this Tree and all others: It flouri&s;hes once a year, in the &s;ea&s;on of the Rains, and then it renews &s;ome part of its leaves. The wood of it is very &s;olid and weighty, whence it comes that it may be poli&s;h'd, and &s;ome Savages make their Clubs of it. Having taken off a Ver|milion-pith which is under the bark, there appears the heart of the tree, which is extream hard, and of a Violet colour, for which it is much e&s;teemed by the curious.</P>
<P>The good &s;cent of this tree con&s;i&s;ts particularly in its leaves: they are of the &s;ame figure with tho&s;e of the <HI>Guava-tree,</HI> and when they are handled, they perfume the hands with a &s;weeter &s;cent then that of the <HI>Laurel:</HI> they derive to Meat and Sauces &s;o de|licate a <HI>gu&s;to,</HI> as might be attributed rather to a compo&s;ition of &s;everal Spices, then to a &s;imple leaf: It is u&s;ed al&s;o in the Baths pre&s;crib'd by Phy&s;icians to fortifie brui&s;ed Nerves, and dry up

<HEAD>IRON-WOOD.</HEAD>
<P>BUt above all there is a particular account made of the <HI>Iron|wood,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e in &s;olidity, weight, and hard|ne&s;s, it exceeds all tho&s;e we have yet de&s;cribed. This tree, which may be ranked among the highe&s;t and be&s;t proportioned of any in the&s;e&punc; I&s;lands, is well furni&s;h'd with branches, and tho&s;e with little leaves with &s;harp points, and divided neer the &s;talk. It flouri&s;hes twice a year, to wit, in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Septem|ber.</HI> The flowers of it, which are of a Violet colour, are &s;uc|ceeded by a &s;mall fruit about the bigne&s;s of a Cherry, which as it ripens grows black, and is much &s;ought after by the Birds. The bark of the trunk is of a browni&s;h colour: The wood is of a very bright red being newly fell'd, but lying abroad in the air it lo&s;es much of its liveline&s;s and lu&s;tre. The heart of the Tree is of a very dark red, like that of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and of &s;uch hard|ne&s;s that the wedges mu&s;t be very &s;harp and well try'd before, to bring it to the ground. But the wood of it being fair to the eye, &s;olid, ea&s;ie to be poli&s;h'd, and more incorruptible then ei|ther <HI>Cedar</HI> or <HI>Cypre&s;s,</HI> it abundantly requites by all the&s;e excel|lent qualities the pains is taken about it before there can be any u&s;e made thereof.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Tree known by the &s;ame name, but it is not comparable to the former: It bears only &s;mall leaves, and when it flouri&s;heth, it is loaden with abundance of Po&s;ies, as it were, ri&s;ing up above the branches like &s;o many Plumes of Feathers, which give it an extraordinary ornament. It is of a great height, and the inner-bark is yellowi&s;h or white, accord|ing to the places where it grows. All the wood of this Tree, the heart only excepted, which is very &s;mall, very hard, and inclining to black, is &s;ubject to worms; whence it comes that it is not commonly u&s;ed, but for want of other.</P>
<P>There are in the <HI>Caribbies</HI> many Trees fit for Dying: The mo&s;t e&s;teemed and be&s;t known are the <HI>Bra&s;il-wood,</HI> the <HI>Yellow|wood,</HI> the <HI>Green-Ebony,</HI> and the <HI>Roucou.</HI></P>

The trunk of it is not &s;trait as that of other Trees, but crooked, uneven, and full of knots like the <HI>White-Thorn.</HI> When it is loaden with flowers there comes from it a &s;weet &s;cent, which fortifies the Brain.

<P>THe I&s;land of <HI>S. Croix</HI> is the mo&s;t famous of all the I&s;lands for its abundance in rare and precious Trees.

When the Engli&s;h had the I&s;land they &s;ent much of it to their own Country. It is called the <HI>Yellow-wood,</HI> from its colour.</P>

The Tree is very bu&s;hy by rea&s;on its root &s;hoots forth a great number of Suckers, which hinder it from growing &s;o high and big as it might, if the &s;ap were directed only to the trunk. The leaves are &s;mooth, and of a bright-green colour. Within the outer-bark there is about two inches of white inner-bark, and the re&s;t of the wood to the heart is of &s;o dark a green that it inclines to black: but when it is poli&s;h'd, there appear certain yellow veins which make it look as if it were marbled.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Roucou</HI> is the &s;ame Tree which the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> call <HI>Uru|cu.</HI> It grows no higher then a &s;mall <HI>Orange-tree:</HI> Its leaves, which are pointed at one end, have the figure of a heart: It bears flowers in colour white, mixt with Carnation; they con&s;i&s;t of five leaves, in form like a Star, and about the big|ne&s;s of a Ro&s;e: They grow in little bu&s;hes at the extremities of the branches. The&s;e flowers are &s;ucceeded by little huskes, in which are enclo&s;ed &s;everal &s;eeds about the bigne&s;s of a &s;mall Pea, which being come to ripene&s;s are of the mo&s;t bright and lively Vermilion colour that can be imagined. This rich Dy|ing-Commodity which is enclos'd in the &s;aid husk is &s;o &s;oft and vi&s;cous that it &s;ticks to ones fingers as &s;oon as it is touch'd.</P>
<P>To get this precious liquor they &s;hake in an earthen ve&s;&s;el

the &s;eeds unto which it is fa&s;tened; then there is poured there|to warm water, in which they are wa&s;h'd till &s;uch time as they have lo&s;t their Vermilion colour; and then when this water hath re&s;ted a while, they dry in the &s;hade the dregs or thick Lye which is at the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, and then it is made up into Lozenges or little Balls, which are very much e&s;teem'd by Painters and Dyers when they are pure and without mix|ture, as tho&s;e are whereof we have now given the de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>The wood of this Tree is ea&s;ily broken: It is very good for firing, and if the fire &s;hould be quite out, it is only rubbing for a certain time two pieces one again&s;t another, and they will ea&s;t forth &s;parks like a Fire-lock, which will &s;et fire on the Cotton, or any other matter &s;u&s;ceptible thereof, that is laid neer to receive it. Of the Bark of it are made Lines which la&s;t a long time. The Root of it gives a delicate <HI>gu&s;to</HI> to Meats, and when there is any of it put into Sauces, it commu|nicates to them the colour and &s;cent of <HI>Saffron.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> have of the&s;e Trees in all their Gardens, are very careful in the ordering and keeping of them, and e&s;teem them very highly, becau&s;e from them they have the bright Vermilion with which they make their Bodies red: they u&s;e it al&s;o in Painting, and to give a lu&s;tre and hand&s;omne&s;s to tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els which they make u&s;e of in their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>There might well be numbred among the Trees fit for Dy|ing mo&s;t of tho&s;e which yield any Gums: For tho&s;e who have had the curio&s;ity to make a tryal thereof, have found by ex|perience, that being mixt in Dying they heighten the darke&s;t and dulle&s;t colours, by a certain liveline&s;s and lu&s;tre which they communicate thereto.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia-tree</HI> grows up to the bigne&s;s, and comes neer the figure of a <HI>Peach-tree,</HI> the leaves of it being &s;omewhat long and narrow: They fall off once a year, in the time of the great Droughts, and when the &s;ea&s;on of the Rain comes in, it puts forth new ones: They are preceded by &s;everal Po&s;ies of of yellow flowers, which are &s;ucceeded by long Pipes or Cods about the bigne&s;s of a mans thumb, and &s;ometimes a foot and a half, or two foot in length: They contain within them, as in &s;o many little Cells, that Medicinal Drug &s;o well known to the Apothecaries, called <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia,</HI> which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> call <HI>Mali Ma|li.</HI> Before the fruit is grown to its full bigne&s;s and length it is always green; but as it advances to perfection and ripene&s;s it becomes of a browni&s;h or Violet colour, and &s;o continues, hang|ing at the branches.</P>

<HEAD>MEDICINAL NUTS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Medicinal Nuts,</HI> which are &s;o common in all the I&s;lands, grow on a &s;mall Tree, which is for the mo&s;t part u&s;ed to partitions between the Gardens and Plantations. If it were not hindred from growing, it would come up to the height of an ordinary Fig-tree, which it &s;omwhat re&s;embles in figure. The wood of it is very tender and pithy, and it &s;hoots forth &s;everal bracnhes which &s;camble confu&s;edly about the trunk: They are loaden with pretty long leaves, green and &s;oft, round below, and ending in three points.</P>
<P>Out of the wood and leaves of this Tree there comes a mil|ky juice, which &s;tains Linen: nay there is no plea&s;ure in being neer it when it rains, for the drops which fall from the leaves have the &s;ame effect as the juice: It bears &s;everal yellow flowers con&s;i&s;ting of five leaves, which when they are fully blown look like &s;o many &s;tars. The flowers falling, there come in the places of &s;ome of them little Nuts, which at fir&s;t are green, then turn yellow, and at la&s;t black, and a little open, when they are ripe. Within every Nut there are three or four &s;tones, in &s;o many little cells, the rind whereof is blacki&s;h, in bigne&s;s and figure &s;omwhat like a bean. The rind being taken away, there is in every one of them a white kernel of an oily &s;ub&s;tance, which is inclo&s;ed and divided in the mid&s;t by a thin film or pel|licle: The&s;e kernels are of a ta&s;te plea&s;ant enough, not much different from that of Small-Nuts: but if they be not mode|rately eaten they will violently purge both upwards and down|wards, e&s;pecially if the &s;kin which enclo&s;es them, and the pel|licle dividing them in the mid&s;t be &s;wallow'd: To moderate their quality, and that they may be taken with le&s;s danger, the way is to clean&s;e them of tho&s;e &s;kins and pellicles, and put them for a little while upon the coals; then being beaten, or bruis'd, four or five of them may be taken in a little Wine, as a vehicle or corrective.</P>
<P>The boughs of this Tree being cut off and thru&s;t into the ground do ea&s;ily take root. The <HI>Portuguez</HI> extract an oyl out of the kernels, which is good enough for the u&s;es of the Kitchin, and may al&s;o be u&s;eful in Medicine.</P>

But it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that in the di&s;tributi|on which the Divine Wi&s;edome hath made of its bounties, the <HI>Caribby-I&s;lands</HI> have had a very large portion: For, to con|fine our &s;elves to the de&s;ign we intend to pro&s;ecute, not only the greater &s;orts of Trees, which we have de&s;cribed in the for|mer Chapters, contribute to the Shelter, Nouri&s;hment, Cloath|ing, Health, and &s;everal other accommodations of the Inha|bitants; but there are al&s;o divers &s;hrubs, or le&s;&s;er Trees, which either &s;hoot forth Roots, or bear Fruits conducing to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as &s;hall be &s;een in the peru&s;al of this Chapter.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MANYOC.</HEAD>
<P>IN&s;tead of Wheat the Inhabitants make u&s;e of the root of a &s;mall Tree called <HI>Manyoc,</HI> by &s;ome <HI>Manyot,</HI> and by others <HI>Mandioque,</HI> of which is made a kinde of Bread delicate enough, called <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava:</HI> whence it is al&s;o &s;ometimes called the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava-tree.</HI> This root is &s;o fruitful, that a &s;mall parcel of ground planted therewith will feed more per&s;ons then &s;ix times as much &s;own with the be&s;t Wheat could do: It &s;hoots forth crooked branches about the height of five or &s;ix foot, ea&s;ie to be broken, and full of &s;mall knots: the leaf is narrow and &s;omewhat long: at nine moneths end the root comes to its maturity: Nay it is reported, that in <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> it grows to the bigne&s;s of a mans thigh in three or four moneths. If the ground be not too moi&s;t the root may continue in it three years with|out corrupting, &s;o that there needs no Store-hou&s;e, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Garret to put it up in; for it is taken out of the ground as it is &s;pent.</P>
<P>To propagate this Root, you mu&s;t take of the branches, and cut them in pieces about a foot in length: then make trenches in your Garden with a Hoe, and thru&s;t in three of tho&s;e &s;ticks triangle-wi&s;e into the earth which had been taken out of the

trenches, and wherewith a little hill or tump had been rais'd: this is called Planting by the trench. But there is another way of planting <HI>Manyoc,</HI> much more expeditious and more ea&s;ie, but the <HI>Manyoc</HI> is neither &s;o fair, nor &s;o much e&s;teemed as the other. The way is only thus, to make a hole in the ground with a &s;tick, and to thru&s;t the <HI>Manyoc</HI> &s;trait into it: care mu&s;t be had in the planting of it, that the knots be not &s;et down|wards, for if they &s;hould the <HI>Manyoc</HI> &s;ticks would not grow. The Indians never plant it otherwi&s;e; but that it may ripen in its &s;ea&s;on, they ob&s;erve a certain time of the Moon, and &s;ee that the ground be not too moi&s;t.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal kinds of the&s;e &s;hrubs differing one from the other only in the colour of the bark of their wood and of their root: Tho&s;e which have the bark greyi&s;h, or white, or green, make a very good ta&s;ted bread, and grow up in a &s;hort time; but the roots they produce do not keep &s;o well, nor thrive comparably to tho&s;e of the red or violet <HI>Manyoc,</HI> which is the mo&s;t common, the mo&s;t e&s;teem'd, and the mo&s;t advan|tageous in hou&s;e-keeping.</P>
<P>The juice of this root is as cold as Hemlock, and &s;o effectual a poy&s;on, that the poor Indians of the greater I&s;lands being per|&s;ecuted with fire and &s;word by the Spaniards, to avoid a more cruel death, made u&s;e of this poy&s;on to de&s;troy them&s;elves.

<P>THe Plant called by the French and others <HI>Pyman,</HI> or <HI>Ame|rican Pepper,</HI> is the &s;ame which the natural Inhabitants of the Country call <HI>Axi,</HI> or <HI>Carive;</HI> it grows clo&s;e like a little Briar without any prickles: the &s;tem of it is covered with an A&s;h-colour'd rind, and bears &s;everal little boughs loaden with an infinite multitude of leaves, which are pretty long, full of jags, and of a gra&s;s-green colour: Of the&s;e there are three kinds&punc; differing only in the figure of the hu&s;k or cod, or the fruit they bear. One bears only a little red button, &s;omewhat long like a Clove, within which there are very &s;mall &s;eeds, much hotter then the Spices brought from the <HI>Levant,</HI> and in a manner cau&s;tick, which ea&s;ily communicates that picquant qua|lity to all things wherein it is us'd.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind hath a much larger and longer Cod, which when ripe is of a perfect Vermilion colour, and being us'd in Sauces, it makes them yellow, as Saffron would do.</P>
<P>The third hath yet a larger Cod then the precedent, which is thick enough, red as any Coral, and not &s;mooth in all parts:
<PB N="55" REF="32" MS="y">
The &s;eed, which is not &s;o biting, nor &s;o &s;picy as tho&s;e of the other two kinds, lies in the mid&s;t of it: Being ripe it is one of the mo&s;t delightful fruits that may be. The &s;eed hath been brought over into <HI>France</HI> and other parts, and hath come to perfection; but the fruit is not &s;o big as that of <HI>America.</HI> This cod and the &s;eed within it is us'd in&s;tead of pepper, becau&s;e it communicates a certain picquancy to things, like that &s;pice: But the operations of them differ much; for after it hath bit|ten the tongue, and by its acrimony inflam'd the palat, in&s;tead of fortifying and warming the &s;tomach, it weakens it, and cau|&s;es coldne&s;s in it; or rather, according to the opinions of &s;ome Phy&s;icians, it over-heats it, and by its cau&s;tick vertue weak|ens it, cau&s;ing coldne&s;s in it only by accident, ina&s;much as it di&s;per&s;es the radical moi&s;ture, which is the &s;eat of heat. Whence it is ob&s;erv'd in the I&s;lands, that tho&s;e who ordinarily u&s;e it in their meat are &s;ubject to pains in the che&s;t, and apt to contract a yellow colour.</P>

<HEAD>TOBACCO.</HEAD>
<P>THe Plant called <HI>Tobacco,</HI> from the I&s;land <HI>Tabago,</HI> where, as &s;ome affirm, it was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by the Spaniards, had al&s;o the name <HI>Nicotianum</HI> from one <HI>Nicot</HI> a Phy&s;ician, who fir&s;t us'd it in <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;ent it from <HI>Portugal</HI> into <HI>France:</HI> It was al&s;o called <HI>Queen-herb,</HI> hence, that being brought from <HI>America,</HI> it was pre&s;ented to the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> as a rare Plant, and of extraordinary vertues.

La&s;tly, the French call it <HI>Petun,</HI> though <HI>de Lery</HI> is much di&s;pleas'd at the name, affirm|ing, that the Plant he &s;aw in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and which the <HI>Topinam|bous</HI> call <HI>Petun,</HI> differs very much from our <HI>Tobacco.</HI> The <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> in their natural Language call it <HI>Youly.</HI> Heretofore there were known in the I&s;lands but two kinds of <HI>Tobacco</HI>-Plants, commonly called by the Inhabitants <HI>Green-Tobacco,</HI> and <HI>Tongu'd-Tobacco,</HI> from the figure of its leaf; but &s;ince there have been brought from the Continent the &s;eeds of <HI>Viri|nus,</HI> and the Tobacco of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> they are divided into four kinds: The two former are of a great produce, but the two others are more e&s;teem'd by rea&s;on of their &s;weet &s;cent.</P>
<P>All the&s;e kinds of Tobacco-Plants grow in the I&s;lands to the height of a man and higher, if their growth be not check'd by cutting off the tops of their &s;tems: They bear good &s;tore of leaves, which are green, long, downy on the lower &s;ide, and &s;eem in the handling as if they were oiled: Tho&s;e which grow towards the &s;tock of the Plant are larger and longer, as deri|ving more nouri&s;hment from the moi&s;ture of the root.

<P>THe <HI>Potatoe</HI> is a root much like the <HI>Saligots</HI> growing in Gardens, which are called <HI>Topinambous,</HI> or <HI>Jeru&s;alem Artichokes,</HI> but of a much more excellent ta&s;te, and more whol&s;ome.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Topinambous</HI> or Artichokes, which are now not only very common in mo&s;t parts, but cheap, and &s;lighted, as being a tteatment for the poorer &s;ort, were heretofore accounted de|licacies: For in &s;ome extraordinary Entertainments made at

<HI>Paris</HI> by the Princes to certain Emba&s;&s;adours, in the Year M. DC. XVI. they were &s;erv'd up among the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite di&s;hes.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Potatoe</HI> is infinitely beyond it: It thrives be&s;t in a light ground, &s;omewhat moi&s;t, and well ordered: It &s;hoots forth abundance of &s;oft leaves, of a very dark green, in fi|gure like tho&s;e of <HI>Spinage:</HI> They &s;pring from certain fibres which creep along the ground, and in a &s;hort time over-run the place where it is &s;own. And if the ground be well or|der'd, the&s;e fibres within a certain time frame divers roots by the means of certain whiti&s;h filaments which &s;hoot forth below the knots, and ea&s;ily fa&s;ten into the earth. It bears a flower near the &s;ame colour with the root, and like a bell, within which lies the &s;eed: But commonly to propagate this fruit they take only of the&s;e &s;trings or fibres, which lye &s;cattered all over the ground, as we &s;aid, and thru&s;t them into ground pre|par'd for them, and at the end of two or three months they will have produc'd their root, which hath this further ver|tue, that being cut into &s;mall pieces, and thru&s;t into the ground, it produceth its root and leaf as effectually as if the &s;eed lay in each of its lea&s;t parts.</P>
<P>The&s;e roots are of &s;everal colours, and in the &s;ame piece of ground there will be &s;ome white ones, which are the mo&s;t ordinary, &s;ome of a violet colour, &s;ome red as beet|roots, &s;ome yellow, and &s;ome marbled: They are all of an excellent ta&s;te: For, provided they be not full of water, and grew in a ground moderately moi&s;t and dry, that is, par|ticipating of both, they ta&s;te like Che&s;t-nuts, and are a bet|ter nouri&s;hment then the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> which dries up the body; for they are not &s;o dry. Some, as particularly the Engli&s;h, u&s;e the&s;e roots in&s;tead of bread and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> and to that purpo&s;e bake them under the Embers, or upon the coals: For being &s;o prepar'd they are of a better ta&s;te, and are clear'd of that windy quality which is commonly ob&s;erv'd to be in mo&s;t roots. But for the mo&s;t part they are boyl'd, or &s;tew'd in a great iron pot, into which there is a little water put to keep the bottom from burning; then the pot-lid is &s;et on as clo&s;e as may be, that they may &s;tew by that &s;mother'd heat. This is the ordinary treatment of the Servants and Slaves of the Country, who eat them out of the pot with a &s;auce made of <HI>Pyman</HI> and juice of Oranges.</P>
<P>If this root were not &s;o common it would be more e&s;teem'd.

<HEAD>ANANAS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Ananas</HI> or <HI>Pine-Apple</HI> is accounted the mo&s;t delicious fruit, not only of the&s;e I&s;lands, but of all <HI>America.</HI> It is &s;o delightful to the eye, and of &s;o &s;weet a &s;cent, that Na|ture may be &s;aid to have been extreamly prodigal of what was mo&s;t rare and precious in her Trea&s;ury to this Plant.</P>
<P>It grows on a &s;talk about a foot high, encompa&s;&s;ed by about 15 or 16 leaves, as long as tho&s;e of &s;ome kinds of Thi&s;tles, broad as the Palm of a mans hand, and in figure like tho&s;e of <HI>Aloes:</HI> they are pointed at the extremity, as tho&s;e of <HI>Corn-Gla|den,</HI> &s;omewhat hollow in the mid&s;t, and having on both &s;ides little prickles, which are very &s;harp.</P>
<P>The fruit which grows between the&s;e leaves, &s;trait up from the &s;talk, is &s;ometimes about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Melon:</HI> its figure is much like that of a <HI>Pine-Apple:</HI> its rind, which is full of lit|tle compartiments like the &s;cales of fi&s;h, of a pale-green co|lour, border'd with Carnation upon a yellow ground, hath on the out-&s;ide &s;everal &s;mall flowers, which, according to the diffe|rent A&s;pects of the Sun, &s;eem to be of &s;o many different colours as may be &s;een in the Rain-bow; as the fruit ripens mo&s;t of the&s;e flowers fall. But that which gives it a far greater lu&s;tre, and acquir'd it the &s;upremacy among Fruit is, that it is crown'd with a great Po&s;ie, con&s;i&s;ting of flowers and &s;everal leaves, &s;o|lid and jagged about, which are of a bright red colour, and extreamly add to the delightfulne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The Meat or Pulp which is contained within the rind, is a little fibrous, but put into the mouth is turn'd all to juice: it hath &s;o tran&s;cendent a ta&s;te, and &s;o particular to it &s;elf, that tho&s;e who have endeavour'd to make a full de&s;cription of it, not able to confine them&s;elves to one compari&s;on; have bor|row'd what they thought mo&s;t delicate in the <HI>Peach,</HI> the <HI>Straw|berry,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;cadine-grape,</HI> and the <HI>Pippin,</HI> and having &s;aid all they could, been forc'd to acknowledg that it hath a certain particular ta&s;te which cannot ea&s;ily be expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The vertue, or &s;hoot by which this fruit may be perpetu|ated lyes not in its root, nor yet in a &s;mall red &s;eed, which is many times found in its Pulp, but in that Garland wherewith it is cover'd; for as &s;oon as it is put into the ground it takes root, &s;hoots forth leaves, and at the years end produces new fruit. It happens &s;ometimes that the&s;e fruits are charg'd with three po&s;ies or crowns, all which have the vertue of propagating their &s;pecies: but every &s;talk bears fruit but once a year.</P>
<P>There are three or four kinds of them, which the Inhabi|tants di&s;tingui&s;h by the colour, figure, or &s;cent, to wit, the
<PB N="59" REF="34">
<HI>White-Ananas,</HI> the <HI>Pointed,</HI> and that called the <HI>Pippin,</HI> or <HI>Re|nette:</HI> This la&s;t is more e&s;teem'd then the other two, ina&s;much as being ripe it hath as to the ta&s;te all the rare qualities be|fore de&s;cribed; it hath al&s;o a &s;weeter &s;cent then the others, and does not &s;et the teeth &s;o much on edge.</P>
<P>The natural Indians of the Country, and the French who live in the I&s;lands make of this fruit an excellent drink, not much unlike <HI>Malm&s;ey,</HI> when it hath been kept a certain time: there is al&s;o made of it a liquid Con&s;erve, which is one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t delicate of any brought out of the <HI>Indies:</HI> they al&s;o cut the rind into two pieces, and it is pre&s;erv'd dry with &s;ome of the thinne&s;t leaves, and then the pieces are neatly joyn'd together again, and they ice it over with Sugar, by which means the figure of the fruit and leaves is perfectly pre&s;erv'd; and there may be &s;een in tho&s;e happy Countries, not|with&s;tanding the heats of the Torrid Zone, a plea&s;ant repre&s;en|tation of the &s;ad productions of Winter.</P>
<P>In Phy&s;ick the Vertues of it are the&s;e: The juice does ad|mirably recreate and exhilarate the Spirits, and comfort the Heart; it al&s;o fortifies the Stomack, cureth Quea&s;ine&s;s, and cau&s;eth Appetite: it gives pre&s;ent ea&s;e to &s;uch as are troubled with the Stone, or &s;toppage of Urine; nay it de&s;troys the force of Poy&s;on. If the fruit be not procurable, the root will do the &s;ame effects. The water extracted from it by di&s;tilling hath a quicker and more effectual operation; but in regard it is too corro&s;ive, and offends the mouth, palat, and uretory ve&s;&s;els, it mu&s;t be very moderately u&s;ed, and with the advice of an able Phy&s;ician, who knows how to correct that Acrimony.</P>

<P>THe Reed which by its delicious juice &s;upplies that &s;ub|&s;tance whereof Sugar is made, hath leaves like tho&s;e of other Reeds which grow in Mar&s;hes and neer Ponds, but only they are a little longer and &s;harper; for if they be not ta|ken with a certain care and &s;leight, they will cut a mans hands like a Ra&s;our. It is call'd the <HI>Sugar-Cane,</HI> and grows up in height between five and &s;ix foot, and two inches about: it is divided by &s;everal knots, which are commonly four or five inches di&s;tant one from another; and the greater the di&s;tance is between the knots, the more Sugar are the Canes apt to yield.</P>
<P>The leaves of it are long, green, and grow very thick, in the mid&s;t whereof ri&s;es the Cane, which al&s;o at the top is loa|den with &s;everal pointed leaves, and one kind of knot of them which contains the &s;eed: it is as full as it can be of a white and juicy pith, out of which is drawn that liquor that makes the Sugar.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="35">It thrives extreamly in a fat &s;oil, &s;o it be light and &s;omewhat moi&s;t: it is planted in trenches made at equal di&s;tances one from another, either with a Hoe, or a Plow, about half a foot deep: Having there laid the Canes, being ripe they cover them with earth, and a little while after out of every knot &s;hoots forth a root, and out of that a &s;tem which produces a new Cane. As &s;oon as it appears above ground, it mu&s;t be carefully weeded all about, that the weeds choak it not: but as &s;oon as it hath cover'd the ground it &s;ecures it &s;elf, and keeps its footing as well as any Cop&s;e-wood might do, and it may la&s;t fifty years without being renew'd, &s;o the main root be &s;ound and not injured by the worm; for if there be any jealou&s;ie of that, the remedy is to take up the whole Plant as &s;oon as may be, and to order it all anew.</P>
<P>Though the Canes be ripe at the end of nine or ten moneths, yet will they not be any way prejudic'd if continu'd in the ground two years, nay &s;ometimes three, after which they de|cay: But the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way is to cut them every year as neer the ground as may be, and below the la&s;t knot or joynt.</P>

<P>THere is in the I&s;land <HI>Tabago</HI> a kind of Herb, which be&s;ides its <HI>perpetual growing</HI> is al&s;o <HI>&s;en&s;ible,</HI> whence it is called the <HI>Sen&s;itive Plant:</HI> it grows up about a foot and a half in height, encompa&s;s'd with a many leaves, in length a foot or better, in bredth three fingers, jagg'd almo&s;t like tho&s;e of Fern, being at the extremities of a green colour checquer'd with little browni&s;h or red &s;pots. In the &s;ea&s;on of fruits there grows out of the mid&s;t of this Plant a round flower, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal leaves &s;tanding much after the &s;ame order as tho&s;e of the Marigold; but they are of a bright violet colour, and being handled have a good scent; the nature of this Plant is &s;uch, that if one pluck off the leaves of it, or &s;o much as touch them, the whole Plant withers, and all the other leaves fall to the ground, as if it had been trod under feet; and ac|cording to the number of the leaves that had been pluck'd off it will be a longer or &s;horter time ere it recover that lo&s;s.</P>
<P>There grows &s;uch another at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which the Inha|bitants call <HI>Hae&s;t-vel,</HI> that is, the <HI>Living-herb:</HI> but it is not the &s;ame kind as that which may be &s;een in the Kings Garden at <HI>Paris;</HI> for that hath a much le&s;&s;er leaf, and it is neither &s;potted nor jagg'd and which is more, it bears no flowers: be&s;ides, its leaves being touch'd, clo&s;e together by a certain kind of con|traction; whereas that we de&s;cribe &s;heds its leaves on the ground.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another kind of living or &s;en&s;itive Plant in &s;ome of the other I&s;lands: it grows &s;ometimes to the height of a &s;hrub: it hath many little branches, which are at all times loaden with an infinite number of long and narrow leaves, which during the rains are enamell'd with &s;mall golden flowers, like &s;o many &s;tars. But what makes this Plant e&s;teem'd one of the rare&s;t and mo&s;t admirable of any in the world&punc; is, that as &s;oon as one would fa&s;ten on it with his hand, it draws back its leaves, and wriggles them under its little branches, as if they were wither'd; and when the hand is remov'd, and the party gone away &s;ome di&s;tance from it, it &s;preads them abroad again.</P>
<P>Some call this Plant the <HI>Cha&s;te Herb,</HI> becau&s;e it cannot en|dure to be touch'd without expre&s;&s;ing its re&s;entment of the injury. Tho&s;e who have pa&s;s'd by the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to <HI>Panama</HI> relate, that there are whole Woods of a Tree called the <HI>Sen&s;itive-tree,</HI> which being touch'd the branches and
<PB N="64" REF="37">
leaves &s;tart up, making a great noi&s;e, and clo&s;e together into the figure of a Globe.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince there was to be &s;een in the Kings Garden at <HI>Paris</HI> a <HI>Sen&s;itive-&s;hrub,</HI> valued at a very great rate: But &s;ome body having advis'd the putting of it in the bottom of a Well to keep it from the cold, and the &s;harpne&s;s of Winter, it there mi&s;erably peri&s;h'd, to the great regret of the Curious.</P>

<HEAD>PASSION-FLOWER.</HEAD>
<P>THere is another Plant in the&s;e I&s;lands famous for the beauty of its leaves, the &s;weet &s;cent of its flowers, and the excellency of its fruit: The Spaniards call it <HI>Grenadile;</HI> the Dutch, <HI>Rhang-Appel,</HI> and the French, <HI>La Fleur de la Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> that is, <HI>The Pa&s;&s;ion-Flower,</HI> becau&s;e it bears that rare flower wherein may be &s;een, not without admiration, &s;ome of the In&s;tru|ments of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviours Pa&s;&s;ion plainly repre&s;ented. 'Tis true, &s;ome curious Per&s;ons, who have attentively con&s;idered it do affirm, that they have ob&s;erv'd therein a certain re&s;em|blance of the Crown of Thornes, the Scourges, the Nails, the Hammer, and the Pillar: but they add withall, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e things are therein repre&s;ented or figured much after the &s;ame manner as Virgins, Lyons, and Bears are &s;een among the Ce|le&s;tial Bodies; &s;o that to find all the&s;e repre&s;entations of the Pa&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e flowers, they &s;ay with <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> in his Hi&s;tory, <HI>Lib. 4.

<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of them, all which have this common, that if they meet not with &s;ome Tree to fa&s;ten them&s;elves too, they creep along the ground as Ivy doth; that their flowers are di&s;play'd after Sun-ri&s;ing, and clo&s;e again before it &s;ets; and that they bear a delicate and very refre&s;hing fruit: but the leaves, flowers, and fruits of &s;ome are &s;o different, as to their outward figure, that it is not to be wondred if the Authors who treat of this Plant, imagining there had been but one kind, agree not in their de&s;criptions thereof. The Inhabitants of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> number &s;even kinds thereof; but in the <HI>Caribbies</HI> there are but tho&s;e two known, which are repre&s;ented among the Sculps of this Chapter.</P>
<P>One hath very large leaves, which are divided into five le&s;|&s;er leaves, whereof that in the mid&s;t is round at the top, and the four others pointed: its flower being fully blown is big|ger then a Ro&s;e; it is enclos'd neer the &s;tem in three little green leaves, the body con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal other beautiful leaves, whereof &s;ome are of a Sky-colour, chequer'd with little red pricks, which have the figure of a Crown, and others are of a purple colour: All this fair flower is encompa&s;s'd with an in|finite
<PB N="68" REF="39">
number of &s;mall waving filaments, which are as it were the beams of this little Sun among the flowers; they are en|amell'd with White, Red, Blew, Carnation, and &s;everal other lively colours, which contribute an admirable grace thereto.</P>
<P>The other kind hath al&s;o its leaves divided into five parts as the former; but its flower, which is like a little bowl, border|ed above with little white and red &s;trings, is not &s;o large: with|in it is adorned with white pointed leaves: there &s;hoots as it were out of the heart of both the&s;e kinds of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion-Flowers</HI> a &s;mall round Pillar, which hath on its chapter a button be|&s;et with three grains, &s;omewhat like Cloves.

<P>The&s;e flowers, which are of a &s;weet &s;cent, falling off, the button that is on the pillar grows &s;o big, that it comes to be a fair yellow fruit, &s;mooth, and about the bigne&s;s of an ordi|nary Apple. The rind of it is as thick as that of a Pomegra|nate, and it is full of a certain juice, very delicious to the ta&s;te, among which there is a great number of kernels, which are black, and extreamly hard. This fruit is pre&s;crib'd as a &s;ove|reign refre&s;hment to &s;uch as are in Fevers, and it hath been found by experience, that it hath a &s;ingular vertue to retrive lo&s;t Appetite, to comfort the vital Spirits, and to abate the heat of the Stomack. The Inhabitants of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> are very care|ful in the cultivation of this Plant, u&s;ing it as a &s;ingular orna|ment for the covering of their Arbours, and other places in their Gardens; for its leaves and flowers make a very delightful &s;hade, and they make of the fruit a cordial &s;yrrup, which is highly e&s;teem'd among them upon this account, that be&s;ides the properties a&s;&s;igned it in our de&s;cription, it hath al&s;o this remarkable quality, that tho&s;e who are once accu&s;tomed to u&s;e it &s;hall never have an aver&s;ion again&s;t it.

<P>THe <HI>Agouty</HI> is of a dark colour inclining to black, having a rough, light hair, and a little tail without any hair: it hath two teeth in the upper jaw, and as many in the neather: It holds its meat in the two fore-pawes, like a Squirrel: the cry of it is, as if it di&s;tinctly pronounc'd the word <HI>Co&uuml;ye.</HI> 'Tis hunted with Dogs, and its fle&s;h, though ta&s;ting &s;omewhat rank, is by many preferr'd before that of Conies: When it is hunted it gets into hollow Trees, out of which it is forc'd by &s;moak made, after it hath cry'd &s;trangely: if it be taken young, it is ea&s;ily tamed, and when he is angred the hair on his back &s;tands up, and he &s;trikes the ground with his hind-feet, as Co|nies do: He is much about the &s;ame bigne&s;s, but his ears are &s;hort and round, and his teeth as &s;harp as a Ra&s;our.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Reptiles found in the&s;e I&s;lands.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to treat of the <HI>Reptiles,</HI> which, being naturally enemies to cold, mu&s;t needs exceedingly multiply in the&s;e hot Countries: Be&s;ides, the va&s;t Woods and the Rocks of the&s;e I&s;lands very much advance their production, in regard they afford them &s;ecure retreats.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Several kinds of Serpents and Snakes.</HEAD>
<P>THere are indeed very few venemous Bea&s;ts in the <HI>Carib|bies,</HI> though there be many Serpents and Snakes of &s;e|veral colours and figures: There are &s;ome nine or ten foot long, and as big as a mans arm or thigh: Nay there hath been heretofore kill'd one of the&s;e Snakes, which had in her belly a whole Hen, feathers and all, and above a dozen egges, the Hen having been &s;urpriz'd as &s;he was &s;itting: Another was found that had devour'd a Cat; whence a gue&s;s may be made at their bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>But how prodigious &s;oever they are, as to their bulk, yet are they not venemous in mo&s;t of the&s;e Countries: Nay &s;ome Inhabitants having of them on the thatch of their hou&s;es, which is commonly of Palm-leaves, or Sugar-Canes, drive them not thence, becau&s;e they force away and devour the rats. But we mu&s;t acknowledge withal, that there is an ho&s;tility be|tween them and the Poultry. It hath been ob&s;erv'd, that &s;ome of them have been &s;o &s;ubtle, as, having &s;urpriz'd a Hen &s;itting, not to meddle with her during that time; but a&s;&s;oon as the chickens are hatch'd, they devour them, and kill the Hen, if they be not able to &s;wallow her down whole.</P>
<P>There are others very fair and delightful to the eye; for they are green all over, &s;ave that under the belly they are of a very light grey: They are about an ell and a half in length, and &s;ometimes two; but, proportionably to that length, they are very &s;mall, as being at mo&s;t not above an inch about: They feed either on Frogs, which they find near &s;ome brooks, or on Birds, which they &s;urprize on the Trees, or in their ne&s;ts, when they meet with them. Accordingly, this kind of Snake is accounted noble in compari&s;on of the others; for it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by its fi&s;hing and hunting. Some of the Inha|bitants, who have been us'd to &s;ee all the&s;e kinds of Snakes, handle them without any fear, and carry them in their bo|&s;oms. Tho&s;e who have travell'd into <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affrick</HI> affirm, that they have there met with &s;omewhat of the like nature:
<PB N="73" REF="42" MS="y">
For they relate, that in <HI>Great Tartary</HI> there are mountains where may be &s;een Serpents of a prodigious bulk, but not ve|nemous at all, nay they are good meat: And that in the Kingdom of <HI>Syr</HI> &s;ome of the&s;e Creatures have been &s;een playing with children, who fed them with bread. It is &s;aid al&s;o, that in the Provinces of the <HI>Antes,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> there are dreadful Snakes between 25 and 30 foot in length, which never hurt any body.</P>
<P>As to the I&s;lands of <HI>Martinico</HI> and S. <HI>Alousia</HI> it is other|wi&s;e; for there &s;ome are not dangerous at all, others are very much &s;o: Tho&s;e which are not, are bigger and longer then the others; whence it comes, that tho&s;e who know them not are more afraid of them, then of &s;uch as &s;hould really be feared: Yet do they not any harm; nay a&s;&s;oon as they perceive any body, they make all the ha&s;te they can away; which hath occa&s;ion'd their being call'd the <HI>fugitive Snakes.</HI> They are al&s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the others by the black and white &s;pots on their backs.</P>
<P>Of the dangerous Snakes there are two kinds: Some are grey on the back, and to the feeling like velvet; others are all yellow or red, and dreadful to look upon by rea&s;on of that colour, though they be not more dangerous, nay haply le&s;s then the former. Both kinds are great lovers of rats, as well as tho&s;e without venome; and when a Cott is much pe|&s;ter'd with rats, 'tis &s;trange if there be not al&s;o Snakes a|bout it. They are of different bigne&s;s and length, and it is conceiv'd the &s;horte&s;t are mo&s;t to be feared: Their heads are flat and broad, their jaws extreamly wide, and arm'd with eight teeth, and &s;ometimes ten, whereof &s;ome are forked like a Cre&s;cent, and &s;o &s;harp, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine any thing more: And the&s;e being all hollow, it is by that &s;mall channel that they di&s;per&s;e their poy&s;on, which lies in little pur&s;es on both &s;ides of their throat, ju&s;t at the very roots of their teeth: They never chew any thing they eat, but &s;wallow it down whole after they have cru&s;h'd and made it flat. Some affirm, that if they did chew their food they would poy&s;on them&s;elves, and that to prevent that they cover their teeth with their gums when they take their nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The&s;e creatures are &s;o venemous in tho&s;e two I&s;lands, that when they have &s;tung any one, if there be not a pre&s;ent re|medy immediately apply'd, the wound within two hours will be incurable. All the commendation can be given them is this, that they never &s;ting any one if he do not touch either them, or &s;omething on which they repo&s;e them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>LIZZARDS.</HEAD>
<P>THere are al&s;o in the&s;e I&s;lands &s;everal kinds of <HI>Lizzards:</HI> The greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable are tho&s;e which &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> call <HI>Iguanas,</HI> the <HI>Bra&s;ilians, Senembi,</HI> and our <HI>Caribbi|ans, Onayamaca:</HI> Being come to their full growth they are about five foot in length, mea&s;uring from the head to the ex|tremity of the tail, which is as long as all the re&s;t of the body; and for their bigne&s;s they may be a foot about: their &s;kins are of &s;everal colours according to the different &s;oils they are bred in. Hence it is probably that the <HI>Portuguez</HI> have call'd them <HI>Came|leons,</HI> out of an imagination that they were a &s;pecies of that creature. In &s;ome I&s;lands the Females are of a light green, chequer'd with black and white &s;pots, and the Males are grey: In others the&s;e la&s;t are black, and the Females of a light grey, intermixt with black and green: Nay in &s;ome places both Males and Females have all the little &s;cales of their &s;kin &s;o glit|tering, and as it were &s;tudded, that &s;een at a di&s;tance one would think them cloth'd in rich cloth of gold or &s;ilver: They have on their backs prickles like combs, which they force up, and let down as they plea&s;e, and appear le&s;s and le&s;s from the head to the end of the tail: They go on four feet, each where|of hath five claws which have very &s;harp nails: They run very fa&s;t, and are excellent at the climbing of Trees: But, whe|ther it be that they love to look on men, or are of a &s;tupid un|apprehen&s;ive nature, when they are perceiv'd by the Hunts|men they patiently expect without &s;tirring till they are &s;hot: Nay they &s;uffer to be put about their necks that gin with a run|ning knot, which is fa&s;ten'd to the end of a pole that is often us'd to get them off the Trees where they re&s;t them&s;elves: when they are angry, a certain craw they have under their throat &s;wells, and makes them &s;eem the more formidable: Their jaws are very wide, their tongues thick, and they have &s;ome very &s;harp teeth: they will hardly let go what they have once fa&s;ten'd on with their teeth, but they are not venemous at all.</P>
<P>The Females lay egges about the bigne&s;s of tho&s;e of Wood|qui&s;ts, but the &s;hell is &s;oft: they lay them deep enough under the &s;and on the Sea-&s;ide, and leave them to be hatch'd by the Sun, whence &s;ome Authors have rank'd them among the Am|phibious creatures. The Savages taught the Europaeans the way to take the&s;e Lizzards, and by their own examples en|courag'd them to eat thereof: They are very hard to kill, in|&s;omuch that &s;ome having receiv'd three &s;hots of a Gun, and thereby lo&s;t &s;ome part of their entrails, would not fall: And yet if a &s;mall &s;tick be thru&s;t into their no&s;es, or a pin between their eyes, where there is a little hole into which the pin ea&s;ily
<PB N="75" REF="43" MS="y">
enters, they pre&s;ently dye: The <HI>Caribbians</HI> are very dextrous in the taking of them by a Gin with a running knot, which they cunningly get about their necks: or having overtaken them by running, they lay hold on them with one hand by the tail, which being very long gives them a good hold, and be|fore they can turn back to bite them, they take them by the chine-piece of the neck, and then having turn'd their paws on their backs, they bind them, and &s;o keep them alive above fif|teen days without giving them any &s;u&s;tenance: Their fle&s;h is white, and in &s;ome places over-laid with fat: Tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to it think it very delicate, e&s;pecially the lu&s;hious ta&s;te it naturally is of being taken away by good Spices, and &s;ome picquant &s;auce; yet is it not &s;afe to eat often thereof, becau&s;e it over-dries the body, and abates &s;omewhat of the good con&s;titution thereof: the egges have no white, but are all yolk, which makes the Pottage they are u&s;ed in as excellent as our Hens-egges might do.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e greater forts of Lizzards, there are in the&s;e I&s;lands four others, which are much le&s;s; and the&s;e are called, <HI>Anolis, Roquets, Maboujats,</HI> and <HI>Gobe-monches,</HI> or <HI>Fly|catchers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ANOLIS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Anolis</HI> are very common in all the Plantations: they are about the bigne&s;s and length of the Lizzards &s;een in <HI>France;</HI> but they have a longer head, the &s;kin yellowi&s;h, and on their backs they have certain blew, green and grey &s;treaks drawn from the top of the head to the end of the tail: their abode is in holes under ground, whence in the night time they make a very loud and importunate noi&s;e: In the day time they are in perpetual exerci&s;e, and they only wander about Cottages to get &s;omewhat to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on.</P>

This employment they perform with &s;uch dexterity and nimblene&s;s, that the &s;leights and de&s;igns of Hunts-men are nothing com|par'd to tho&s;e of this little Bea&s;t; for he &s;culks down, and &s;tand as it were Sentinel on a plank, or &s;ome other thing that is higher then the floor, where he hopes the Fly will light; and perceiving his prey, he keeps his eye always fixt upon it, putting his head into as many different po&s;tures as the Fly &s;hifts places; and &s;tanding up on his fore-feet, and gaping after it, he half opens his little wide mouth, as if he already devour'd and &s;wallow'd it by hope: Nay though there be a noi&s;e made in the room, and &s;ome body come neer him, he is &s;o attentive on his game that he quits not his po&s;t; and having at la&s;t found his ad|vantage, he &s;tarts &s;o directly on his prey, that he very &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es it.

or &s;lime, as the ordinary Snail does, but as &s;oon as they are produc'd out of &s;ome corrupted matter, or otherwi&s;e, they have this in&s;tinct (to &s;ecure the weakne&s;s of their little bodies again&s;t the injuries of the air, and the attempts of other Bea&s;ts) to &s;eek out &s;ome empty habitation, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;hell as they find mo&s;t convenient for them, within which they fit and accommodate them&s;elves, as Souldiers, who having no &s;etled habitation take up their quarters in other mens hou&s;es, according to their nece&s;&s;ities, and the then pre|&s;ent po&s;ture of their affairs.</P>
<P>They are commonly &s;een in the &s;hells of Periwincles, or great Sea-Snails, which they find on the &s;hore, whither they are ca&s;t by the waves upon the death of the fi&s;h which had been the fir&s;t inhabitant thereof: but indeed the&s;e little Souldiers are found in all &s;orts of other &s;hells ca&s;t up by the Sea, nay even the &s;hells of the <HI>Liene-nuts,</HI> and &s;ome have took up their quarters in the clawes of great dead Crabs.

<P>THere are in the&s;e I&s;lands &s;everal kinds of great Flies of divers figures and colours: but we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign the fir&s;t place to tho&s;e which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Mouches Lumincu&s;es,</HI> and we may Engli&s;h <HI>Glo-wormes:</HI> Some Savages call them <HI>Cucuyos,</HI> and the <HI>Caribbians</HI> by a name not much differing from it, <HI>Coyou|you.</HI> This Fly is not recommendable for its beauty, or figure, as having nothing extraordinary as to either, but only for its <HI>luminous</HI> quality: they are of a dark colour, and about the bigne&s;s of a Locu&s;t: it hath two hard and &s;trong wings, under which are two le&s;&s;er wings very thin, which appear not but when it flies; and it is then al&s;o it may be ob&s;erv'd that un|der tho&s;e le&s;&s;er wings there is a brightne&s;s, like that of a Can|dle, which enlightens all about it: be&s;ides, the eyes of this In|&s;ect are &s;o luminous, that be it ever &s;o dark, it flies any where in the night, which is the time that this glittering light may be &s;een.</P>
<P>It makes no noi&s;e flying, and lives only on flowers which it gathers off the Trees. Being taken between ones fingers, it is &s;o &s;mooth and &s;lippery, that by the little endeavours it makes to recover its liberty, it in&s;en&s;ibly gets away: Being kept in captivity it conceals all the light it hath under the wings, and communicates only that of its eyes, but even that very weak|ly in compari&s;on of the brightne&s;s it &s;heds being at liberty: it hath no &s;ting, nor any claw for its defence: The <HI>Indians</HI> are glad to have of them in their hou&s;es, for they &s;erve them in|&s;tead of Lamps: but indeed of their own accord, in the night time, they come into tho&s;e rooms which are not kept too clo&s;e.</P>

write, and read the &s;malle&s;t Print that may be. A <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hi|&s;torian relates, that the Indians of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> having the&s;e Flies fa&s;ten'd to their hands and feet, they &s;erv'd them in&s;tead of Torches to go a hunting in the night time: it is affirmed al|&s;o by others, that &s;ome other Indians extract that luminous liquor which the&s;e Flies have in their eyes and under their wings, and that they rub their faces and brea&s;ts therewith in their nocturnal meetings, which makes them appear in the dark to the beholders, as if they were covered with flames, and like dreadful apparitions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Flies are ea&s;ily taken in the night time; and that is done by turning a lighted &s;tick in the air: For as &s;oon as tho&s;e which at the clo&s;e of the evening are ready to come out of the woods perceive that fire, imagining it to be one of their companions, they immediately flye to the place where that light appears to them, and &s;o they may be either &s;truok down with a Hat, or flying of them&s;elves again&s;t the lighted &s;tick, they fall to the ground, not knowing where they are.</P>
<P>Nor will it be ami&s;s to in&s;ert in this place what a learned and curious French Gentleman, one Mon&s;. <HI>du Montel,</HI> from who&s;e generous liberality came &s;everal other remarks which enrich this Hi&s;tory, lately writ to a friend of his concerning the&s;e Flies.</P>
<Q><P>Being in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> (&s;aith he) I have often at the beginning of the night walk'd about the little Huts we had &s;et up for our abode there while our Ship was repairing, to con&s;ider how that the Air was in &s;ome places enlightned by tho&s;e little wandring Stars: But the mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;ight of all was, when they came neer tho&s;e great Trees which bear a kind of Figs, and were not far from our Huts; for &s;ometimes they flew about them, &s;ometimes they would be within the thick boughs, which for a time ob&s;cur'd and eclips'd tho&s;e lit|tle Luminaries; yet &s;o as that their beams might ever and anon be &s;een to break through, though weakly, the inter|po&s;ed leaves: tho&s;e pretty interruptions of light came to us &s;ometimes obliquely, &s;ometimes in a &s;traight line, and per|pendicularly: Afterwards tho&s;e glittering Flies extricating them&s;elves out of the ob&s;curity of tho&s;e Trees, and coming neerer us, we had our plea&s;ure heightned by &s;eeing them on the adjacent Orange-trees, which they &s;eem'd to &s;et a fire, gilding tho&s;e beautiful fruits, enamelling their flowers, and giving &s;uch a lu&s;tre to their leaves, that their naturally de|lightful verdure was extreamly encreas'd by the plea&s;ant combination of &s;o many little lights.

<P>AS &s;oon as any Ships come neer the&s;e I&s;lands, &s;everal Birds which frequent the Sea come to them, as if they had been &s;ent to enquire whence they came: When the Sea-men perceive the&s;e Vi&s;itants they are &s;atisfi'd that it will not be long

<P>The <HI>French</HI> have be&s;tow'd on them the name of <HI>Fregates, Frigots,</HI> becau&s;e of the continuance and lightne&s;s of their flight. Their body is about the bigne&s;s of a wild Drake's; but their wings are very much larger, and they make their way through the air with &s;uch &s;wiftne&s;s, that in a very &s;hort time they will be out of &s;ight: There are &s;everal kinds as to their feathers; for &s;ome are all black, others all grey, &s;ave only the belly and wings, in which there are &s;ome white feathers: They are ex|cellent good at fi&s;hing; and when they perceive a fi&s;h lying even with the water, they fail not, yet as it were only &s;porting them&s;elves, to &s;ei&s;e it, and immediately devour it: They have a &s;trange dexterity in taking the <HI>flying Fi&s;hes;</HI> for as &s;oon as they perceive that that delicate prey makes the water to ri&s;e and bubble a little, and is ju&s;t upon the taking of its flight, to avoid the cruel pur&s;uits of its Sea-enemies, they place them|&s;elves &s;o directly on that &s;ide on which they &s;hould make their &s;ally, that as &s;oon as they are out of the water they receive them into their Beaks, or Claws: So the&s;e innocent and unfor|tunate fi&s;hes, to avoid the teeth of one enemy, many times fall into the claws of another who gives them no better quarter.</P>
<P>The Rocks which are in the Sea, and the little un-inhabited I&s;lands are the places where the&s;e Birds make their abode and their ne&s;ts: The meat of them is not much e&s;teem'd; but their fat is carefully kept, it having been found by experience that it helpeth the Pal&s;ey, and all &s;orts of cold Gouts.</P>

<P>THe Ponds and fenny places which are not much frequen|ted are the retreats of &s;everal great and beautiful Birds about the bigne&s;s of wild Gee&s;e, and of the &s;ame figure with tho&s;e which the Dutch call <HI>Lepelaer,</HI> from the form of their beak, which hath the re&s;emblance of a <HI>&s;poon:</HI> They have long necks, and their legs are of &s;uch length, that their bodies are about three foot from the ground: But they differ as to co|lour, ina&s;much as when they are young their feathers are white, as they grow it becomes of a murrey colour, and when they are old of a bright carnation; from which colour the French took occa&s;ion to call them <HI>Flammans:</HI> There are of the&s;e Birds &s;een neer <HI>Montpelier</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which have the low|er part of their body and under their wings of a carnation co|lour, the upper part black: there are in like manner in the&s;e I&s;lands &s;ome that have a mixture of black and white feathers in their wings.</P>
<P>They are &s;eldom &s;een but in great companies, and their hearing and &s;melling is &s;o perfect, that they &s;mell the Hunts|men and Fire-arms at a great di&s;tance: To avoid all &s;urpri&s;es they pitch in open places, and in the mid&s;t of Fens, whence they may at a great di&s;tance perceive their enemies; and there is always one of the party upon the guard while the re&s;t are &s;earching in the waters for their livelihood; and as &s;oon as he hears the lea&s;t noi&s;e, or perceives a man, he takes his flight, and gives a cry for a &s;ignal to the re&s;t to follow him: when the Hunts-men who frequent <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> would kill &s;ome of the&s;e Birds, which are there very common, they take the wind of

By this &s;leight the&s;e Birds, who are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the wild Oxen that come out of the Mountains to the watering-places below, become the prey of the Hunt&s;-men.

I took &s;o particular notice of it, having had of them in my hands many times, that I have the Idaeas of it &s;till fre&s;h in my memory. Under the belly, wings, and neck, it was of a waving Aurora-colour, the back and one half of the wings of a very bright &s;ky-colour, the tail and greater feathers of the wings were mixt with a &s;parkling carnation, diver&s;ify'd with a &s;ky-colour, as upon the back a gra&s;s-green and a &s;hining black, which very much added to the gold and azure of the other plumage: But the mo&s;t beautiful part was the head, cover'd with a murrey down, checquer'd with green, yellow, and a pale blew, which reach'd down wavingly to the back: The eye-lids were
<PB N="91" REF="53" MS="y">
white, and the apple of the eye yellow and red as a Ruby &s;et in Gold: it had upon the head a certain tuft or cap of fea|thers of a Vermilion red, &s;parking like a lighted coal, which was encompa&s;s'd by &s;everal other le&s;&s;er feathers of a pearl colour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it were recommendable for all the&s;e extraordinary or|naments, it was much more for its familiarity and innocency; for though it had a crooked beak, and that the claws with which he held his meat and brought it to his beak were &s;o &s;harp as to take away whatever it fa&s;tened on, yet was it &s;o tame as to play with little Children and never hurt them; and when one took him into his hand, he &s;o contracted his claws, that the &s;harpne&s;s of them could not be felt. He had this quality of a dog, that he would lick with his &s;hort and thick tongue tho&s;e who made much of him and gave him &s;omething he liked, put his head to their cheeks to ki&s;s and care&s;s them, and expre&s;&s;ing his acknowledgments by a thou|&s;and pretty in&s;iouations, he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be put into what po&s;ture one would, and took a certain plea&s;ure in diverting tho&s;e he thought his friends: But as he was mild and tractable to tho&s;e who were kind to him, &s;o was he as mi&s;|chievous and irreconcileable to &s;uch as had injur'd him, and he could di&s;tingui&s;h them from others, and make them feel the &s;harpne&s;s of his beak and claws.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He &s;poke the <HI>Dutch, Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and in the la&s;t he &s;ung Airs as a natural <HI>Indian:</HI> He al&s;o imitated the cries of all &s;orts of Poultry and other creatures about the hou&s;e: he call'd all his friends by their names and &s;irnames, flew to them as &s;oon as he &s;aw them, e&s;pecially when he was hungry: If they had been ab&s;ent, and that he had not &s;een them a long time, he expre&s;s'd his joy at their return by cer|tain merry notes: when he had &s;ported him&s;elf till they were weary of him, he went away, and perch'd him&s;elf on the top of the hou&s;e, and there he talk'd, &s;ung, and play'd a thou&s;and tricks, laying his feathers in order, and dre&s;&s;ing and cleaning him&s;elf with his beak: He was ea&s;ily kept; for not only the bread commonly u&s;ed in that I&s;land, but all the fruits and roots growing there, were his ordinary food; and when he had more given him then he needed, he carefully laid up the remainder under the leaves wherewith the hou&s;e was covered, and took it when he had need. In a word, I never &s;aw a more loving or more amiable Bird: 'Twas a Pre|&s;ent for any Prince if he could have been brought over the Sea.

called by Engli&s;h Writers the <HI>Humming-Bird,</HI> a Bird ad|mirable for its beauty, bulk, &s;weet &s;cent, and manner of life; for being the lea&s;t of all Birds, he gloriou&s;ly confirmes the &s;aying of <HI>Pliny,</HI> that, <HI>Natura nu&s;quam magis qu&agrave;m in minimis tota e&s;t:</HI> Nature is ever greate&s;t in its lea&s;t productions. Some of the&s;e Birds are no bigger bodied then &s;ome of the greater &s;orts of Flies: Some are of &s;o beautiful a plumage, the neck, wings and back repre&s;ent the Rain-bow, which the Ancients call'd <HI>Iris,</HI> the Daughter of Admiration: There are others have &s;uch a bright red under their neck, that at a di&s;tance one would think it were a Carbuncle: The belly and under the wings are of a gilt-yellow, the thighs as green as an Emerald, the feet and beak as black as poli&s;h'd Ebony, and the two little eyes are two Diamonds &s;et in an oval of the colour of bur|ni&s;h'd &s;teel: The head is of a gra&s;s-green, which gives it &s;uch a lu&s;tre, that it looks as if it were gilt: The Male hath a little tuft, in which may be &s;een all the colours which enamel that little body, the miracle of the feather'd Commonwealth, and one of the rare&s;t productions of Nature: He lets fall and rai&s;es up when he plea&s;es that little cre&s;t of feathers wherewith the Author of Nature hath &s;o richly crowned him, nay all his plumage is more beautiful and &s;hining then that of the Female.</P>
<P>If this Bird be miraculous as to his bulk and plumage, he is no le&s;s as to the activity of his flight, which is &s;uch, that pro|portionably the greate&s;t Birds make not their way through the air with &s;o much force, and make not &s;o loud a noi&s;e as this lit|tle <HI>Colibry</HI> does by the agitation of wings; for a man would think it a little whirle-wind rais'd of a &s;udden in the air, and blowing in his ears: And in regard he takes a plea&s;ure to flye neer tho&s;e who pa&s;s by, he &s;ometimes by his &s;udden &s;urpri&s;al frightens tho&s;e who hear him before they &s;ee him.</P>
<P>He lives only on the Dew which he &s;ucks from the Flowers of Trees with his tongue, which is much longer then his beak, and hollow as a &s;mall reed, and about the bigne&s;s of a &s;mall needle: He is very &s;eldom &s;een on the ground, nor yet &s;tand|ing on the Trees, but &s;u&s;pended in the air, neer the Tree whence he hath his nouri&s;hment: He is born up by a gentle agitation of his wings, and in the mean time he draws to him the dew which &s;tays longe&s;t at the bottom of the flowers half|blown: 'Tis plea&s;ant to look on him in that po&s;ture: For &s;preading abroad his little cre&s;t, a man would think he had on his head a crown of Rubies, and all &s;orts of precious &s;tones; and the Sun adding &s;omewhat to the natural lu&s;tre of his plu|mage makes him look as if he were a compo&s;ition of precious &s;tones animated, and flying in the air: In tho&s;e places where there are mo&s;t Cotton-trees is commonly the greate&s;t &s;tore of <HI>Colibris.</HI></P>

<P>He commonly makes his ne&s;t under a &s;mall branch of &s;ome Orange-tree, or Cotton-tree, and as it mu&s;t be proportiona|ble to the &s;mallne&s;s of his bulk, he &s;o covers it among the leaves, and &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ecures it again&s;t the injuries of the wea|ther, that it is in a manner imperceptible: he is &s;uch an excel|lent Architect, that to prevent his being expos'd to the Ea&s;terly and Northerly Winds, which are the ordinary winds in tho&s;e parts, he places his ne&s;t towards the South: It con&s;i&s;ts on the out-&s;ide of little &s;trings taken from a Plant called <HI>Pite,</HI> and wherewith the Indians make their cordage: The&s;e little &s;trings or filaments are as &s;mall as a mans hair, but much &s;tronger: He ties them and weaves them one into another &s;o clo&s;ely about the little forked branch which he hath cho&s;en for the perpetuation of his &s;pecies, that the ne&s;t being thus among the leaves, and hanging under the branch, is, as we &s;aid before, both out of &s;ight and out of danger: Having made it &s;trong and fortifi'd it on the out-&s;ide with the&s;e filaments, and by &s;ome lit|tle bits of bark and &s;mall herbs interlaced one within another by a miraculous artifice, he furni&s;hes it within with the fine&s;t Cotton, and the Down of certain little feathers &s;ofter then any &s;ilk: The Female commonly lays but two egges which are oval, about the bigne&s;s of a Pea or &s;mall Pearl.</P>

<HEAD>SEA-DEVILS.</HEAD>
<P>ON the Coa&s;ts of the&s;e I&s;lands there is &s;ometimes taken by the Fi&s;hers a Mon&s;ter which is ranked among the kinds of <HI>Sea-Devils,</HI> by rea&s;on of its hideous figure: It is about four foot long, and proportionably big: it hath on the back a great bunch full of prickles like tho&s;e of a Hedg-Hog: The &s;kin of it is hard, uneven and rugged, like that of the Sea-dog, and of a black colour: The head of it is flat, and on the upper part hath many little ri&s;ings, among which may be &s;een two little ve|ry black eyes: The mouth which is extreamly wide, is arm'd with &s;everal very &s;harp teeth, two whereof are crooked and bent in like tho&s;e of a wild Boar: it hath four fins, and a tail broad enough, which is forked at the extremity: But what got it the name of <HI>Sea-Devil,</HI> is, that above the eyes there are two little black horns, &s;harp enough, which turn towards his back like tho&s;e of a Ram: Be&s;ides that this Mon&s;ter is as ugly as any thing can be imagin'd, the meat of it, which is &s;oft and full of &s;trings, is ab&s;olute poy&s;on; for it cau&s;es &s;trange vomiting, and &s;uch &s;woonings as would be follow'd by death if they be not &s;oon prevented by the taking of a do&s;e of good <HI>Mithridate,</HI> or &s;ome other Antidote. This dangerous creature is &s;ought af|ter only by the curious, who are glad to have any thing that comes from it to adorn their Clo&s;ets: And &s;o it comes to pa&s;s that this Devil, who never brought men any profit while it lived, gives a little &s;atisfaction to their eyes after his death.</P>
<P>There is another kind of <HI>Sea-Devil,</HI> no le&s;s hideous then the precedent, though of another figure: The large&s;t of this kind are not much above a foot in length from the head to the tail: They are almo&s;t as much in bredth; but when they plea&s;e they &s;well them&s;elves up, &s;o as that they &s;eem to be round as a bowl: Their wide mouths are arm'd with many little but ve|ry &s;harp teeth, and in&s;tead of a tongue they have only a little bone which is extreamly hard: Their eyes are very &s;parkling, and &s;o &s;mall, and deep &s;et in the head, that the ball thereof can hardly be di&s;cerned: They have between the eyes a little horn which turns up, and before it a pretty big &s;tring that hath at the end of it a little button: Be&s;ides their tail, which is like the broad end of an Oar, they have two plumes, one on the back which &s;tands as it were upright, and the other under the belly: They have al&s;o two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ins, one of each &s;ide over again&s;t the mid&s;t of the belly, having at the extremities &s;ome|what like little paws, each whereof is divided into eight claws, which are armed with &s;harp nails: their &s;kin is rough, and prick|ly all over, like that of the <HI>Requiem,</HI> &s;ave only under the belly: It is of a dark red colour and marked with black &s;pots: the meat of them is not to be eaten: They may be ea&s;ily flayed, and the

<P>WE cannot better conclude the Account we had to give of the Sea-mon&s;ters, then with a de&s;cription of &s;o remarkable and miraculous a Fi&s;h, as may ju&s;tly de&s;erve a particular Chapter to treat of it: It is the <HI>Sea-Uni|corn,</HI> which is &s;ometimes &s;een in tho&s;e parts. There was ca&s;t a&s;hore, in the year 1644. a prodigious one, on the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Tortoi&s;e-I&s;land,</HI> neer <HI>Hi&s;paniola:</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Montel,</HI> having been an eye-witne&s;s thereof, gives us this curious de&s;cripti|on of it.</P>
<Q><P>This <HI>Unicorn,</HI> &s;aith he, was pur&s;uing a <HI>Carangue,</HI> or &s;ome other le&s;&s;er fi&s;h, with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity, that not con&s;idering that it needed a greater depth of water then the other, it &s;tuck with half the body dry on a &s;and-bank, whence it could not recover the deeper waters ere it was de|&s;troy'd by the Inhabitants: It was about eighteen foot in length, being at the large&s;t part of its body about the big|ne&s;s of a great Barrel: It had &s;ix great fins like the ends of Galley-oars, whereof two were placed neer the gills, and the other four on the &s;ides of the belly at equal di&s;tances; they were of a Vermilion red colour: all the upper part of the body was cover'd with great &s;cales about the bigne&s;s of a Crown-piece, which were of a blew colour intermixt with certain &s;pangles of &s;ilver: neer the neck the &s;cales were clo|&s;er, and of a dark colour, &s;eeming as it were a collar: The &s;cales under the belly were yellow; the tail forked, the head &s;omewhat bigger then that of a hor&s;e, and neer the &s;ame figure: It was cover'd with a hard and dark colour'd &s;kin; and as the Land-Unicorn hath one horn in his forehead, &s;o this Sea-Unicorn had a very fair one i&s;&s;uing out of the fore|part of his head, about nine foot and a half in length: it was as &s;trait as could be, and from the place whence it came out it grew &s;maller and &s;maller to the very point, which was &s;o &s;harp, that being thru&s;t hard it would enter into wood or &s;tone, or &s;ome more &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance: It was at the place where it came out of the head about &s;ixteen inches about, and from thence to two thirds of the length it was like a &s;crew,
<PB N="108" REF="65">
or to &s;ay better, made waving like a wreath'd pillar, &s;ave that the channels grew &s;maller and &s;maller till they gently ended in a point, which was two inches beyond the fourth foot. All that lower part had over it an a&s;h-colour'd &s;kin, which was all over cover'd with a &s;mall &s;oft hair, &s;hort as plu&s;h, and of the colour of a wither'd leaf, but under that it was as white as Ivory. As to the other part, which &s;eemed naked, it was naturally poli&s;h'd, of a &s;hining black, marked with certain &s;mall white and yellow &s;troaks, and of &s;uch &s;o|lidity, that a &s;harp file could hardly get a little &s;mall powder from it. It had no ears &s;tanding up, but two &s;pacious gills, as the other fi&s;hes: The eyes were about the bigne&s;s of a Hens egge; the Ball, which was of a &s;ky-colour enamell'd with yellow, was encompa&s;s'd with a certain vermilion, which had beyond it another as clear as Chry&s;tal: The mouth was wide enough, and furni&s;hed with &s;everal teeth, whereof tho&s;e before were extremely &s;harp, and tho&s;e towards the throat in both jaws were broad, and a little knobbed: The tongue was of a length and thickne&s;s proportionable, and covered with a rough &s;kin of a vermilion colour. What was further remarkable, is, that this fi&s;h had upon the head a kind of crown, ri&s;ing above the &s;kin about two inches, and made oval-wi&s;e, the extremities whereof ended in a point. Above three hundred per&s;ons of that I&s;land did eat of the meat of it, and that plentifully, and thought it extremely delicate: It was interlarded with a white fat, and being boiled it came up in fleaks like fre&s;h Cod, but it had a much more excellent ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had &s;een this rare fi&s;h alive, and had with great Levers broken the back of it, affirmed, that he had made prodigious attempts to thru&s;t them with his horn, which he turned with an inexpre&s;&s;ible dexterity and nimblene&s;s, and that if he had had as much water under him as would have born him up, he would have been too hard for them all. When the entrails were taken out, it was found that he liv'd by prey; for there were within him the &s;cales of &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>What could be pre&s;erv'd of this miraculous Animal, e&s;pe|cially the head, and the precious horn fa&s;ten'd in it, hung up neer two years at the Guard-hou&s;e of the I&s;land, till Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Le Va&s;seur,</HI> the Governour of it, pre&s;ented one Mon&s;ieur <HI>des Trancarts</HI> (a Gentleman of <HI>Xaintonge</HI> who had given him a vi&s;it) with the Horn. Not long after, coming over in the &s;ame Ship with the Gentleman who had that precious rarity put up in a long Che&s;t, our Ship was ca&s;t away neer the I&s;land of <HI>Fayala,</HI> one of the <HI>A&s;&s;ores,</HI> and all the Goods were lo&s;t, but nothing &s;o much regretted as the lo&s;s of that Che&s;t.</P></Q>
<P>There is in the Northern Seas another kind of Unicorns,
<PB N="109" REF="65">
which are many times by the Ice carried to the Coa&s;t of <HI>I&s;e|land:</HI> They are of &s;o prodigious a length and bulk, that mo&s;t Authors who have written of them rank them among Whales: They are not cover'd with &s;cales as the formentioned de&s;crib'd by us was, but with a hard black &s;kin like the <HI>Lamantin:</HI> They have but two fins on both &s;ides, and a large plume upon the back, which being narrower in the mid&s;t then at either end, makes as it were a double cre&s;t ri&s;ing up for the more conveni|ent dividing of the waters: they have three vent-holes a little below their necks, at which they ca&s;t up the &s;uperfluous water they had &s;wallow'd, as the Whales do: their heads are &s;harp, and on the left &s;ide of the upper jaw there comes out a horn white all over as the tooth of a young Elephant, which horn is &s;ometimes fifteen or &s;ixteen foot in length: It is wreath'd in &s;ome places, and &s;treaked all over with &s;mall lines of a pearl|colour, which are not only on the &s;uperficies of it, but run through the &s;ub&s;tance: The horn is hollow to the third part, and all over as &s;olid as the harde&s;t bone.</P>
<P>Some will have this prominency to be rather a tooth then a horn, becau&s;e it ri&s;es not out of the forehead, as that we have &s;poken of, nor yet from the upper part of the head, as tho&s;e of Bulls and Rams, but out of the upper jaw, in which it is &s;et, as the teeth are in their proper places: Tho&s;e who are of this opinion &s;ay further, that it is not to be wondred the&s;e fi&s;hes &s;hould have but one &s;uch tooth, when the &s;ub&s;tance out of which others &s;hould be produced is quite exhau&s;ted in the making of that one, which is of &s;uch a prodigious length and bigne&s;s as might &s;uffice to make a hundred.</P>
<P>But whether this &s;trange defen&s;ive wherewith the&s;e mon|&s;trous fi&s;h are armed be called Tooth or Horn, certain it is that they u&s;e it in their engagements with the Whales, and to break the Ice of the Northern Seas, wherewith they are often|times encompa&s;&s;ed: Whence it came, that &s;ome times there have been &s;een of them &s;uch as by rea&s;on of the violent &s;er|vice they have been in, in di&s;ingaging them&s;elves out of tho&s;e icy mountains, have not only had their horns blunted at the point, but al&s;o &s;hattered and broken off: The figures of both this kind and that ca&s;t a&s;hore in the <HI>Tortoi&s;e</HI> I&s;land may be &s;een among the Sculps.</P>
<P>While we were ordering the foregoing &s;tory for the &s;atisfa|ction of the Publick, a Ship of <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> commanded by <HI>Ni|cholas Tunes,</HI> wherein M. <HI>Lamp&s;en,</HI> one of the Deputies of that Province, in the A&s;&s;embly of the States-General, and other con&s;iderable Merchants of the &s;ame Town were concern'd, co|ming in from <HI>Davis-&s;treight,</HI> brought thence among other rari|ties &s;everal excellent pieces of the Unicorns of the Northern Seas, of that kind we &s;poke of before; and in regard the Re|lation &s;ent us of that Voyage may very much clear up the mat|ter
<PB N="110" REF="66">
we treat of, we conceive the Reader will take it kindly to be entertain'd with it, a&s;&s;uring him&s;elf he hath it with the &s;ame &s;incerity as it was communicated to us.</P>
<P>The Captain of whom we have this Relation, leaving <HI>Zea|land</HI> at the end of the Spring, 1656. with a de&s;ign to di&s;cover &s;ome new Commerce in the Northern parts, arrived at the end of <HI>June</HI> following in <HI>Davis-&s;treight,</HI> whence having entred in|to a River which begins at the &s;ixty fourth degree, and ten minutes of the Line Northward, he &s;ailed to the &s;eventy &s;e|cond, under which the Country we intend to de&s;cribe lyes.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Inhabitants of the Country, who were then a fi&s;hing, perceived the Ship, they came towards it with their little Boats, which are &s;o made as that they carry but one per&s;on: The fir&s;t who attempted it occa&s;ion'd the joyning of &s;o many others to them, that in a &s;hort time there was a &s;quadron of &s;e|venty of tho&s;e little ve&s;&s;els, which parted not from the foreign Ship till it had ca&s;t Anchor in the be&s;t Haven, where by their acclamations and all the &s;igns of friend&s;hip and good will that could be expected from a Nation &s;o far unacquainted with ci|vility, they expre&s;s'd the extraordinary joy they conceived at its happy arrival: The&s;e little ve&s;&s;els are &s;o admirable, whe|ther we con&s;ider their materials, or the &s;trange indu&s;try in the making of them, or the incomparable dexterity whereby they are conducted, that they may well be allow'd a place among the de&s;criptions which this delightful digre&s;&s;ion &s;hall furni&s;h us with.</P>
<P>They con&s;i&s;t of little thin pieces of wood, whereof mo&s;t are cleft like Hoops: The&s;e pieces of wood are fa&s;ten'd one to another with &s;trong cords made of the guts of fi&s;hes, which keep them together in a figure fit for the u&s;es to which they are de&s;ign'd: They are cover'd on the out-&s;ide with the &s;kins of Sea-Dogs, which are &s;o neatly &s;ewn together, and &s;o artifi|cially done over with Rozin about the &s;eams, that the water cannot make the lea&s;t entrance into them.</P>
<P>The&s;e little Boats are commonly about fifteen or &s;ixteen foot in length, and they may be in the mid&s;t where they are bigge&s;t about five foot circumference; from that place they grow &s;maller and &s;maller, &s;o that the ends or extremities of them are very &s;harp and plated as it were with a white bone, or a piece of the Unicorns horn before de&s;cribed: The upper|part is flat and even, and cover'd with leather as the re&s;t, and the lower part is fa&s;hion'd like the belly of a great fi&s;h; &s;o that they are very &s;wift upon the water: they have but one overture, or open place, which is ju&s;t in the mid&s;t of the whole &s;tructure: It is rais'd a little about with a &s;mall ledge of Whale-bone, and it is made fit for the reception of one man, &s;o as that being in it, his wa&s;te fills the hole. When the Savages who invented the&s;e kinds of Boats would make u&s;e of them,
<PB N="111" REF="66" MS="y">
either to go a fi&s;hing or to divert them&s;elves on the water, they thru&s;t down their feet and thighs in at the hole, and then &s;itting down they &s;o fa&s;ten the &s;hort Coat they have about them to the ledge which is about the hole, that they &s;eem to be graf|fed into the little ve&s;&s;el, and to be part of it.</P>
<P>Thus much of the figure and materials of the&s;e little ve&s;&s;els; let us now con&s;ider the accoutrement of the men who have the conduct of them: When they intend to go to Sea, they put over their other cloths a certain &s;hort coat, which is kept only for that purpo&s;e: This Sea-coat con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal &s;kins having the hair taken off, which are well dre&s;s'd and &s;et together, that a man would think it to be all of a piece: It reaches from the crown of the head to the Navel: it is rubb'd over with a blacki&s;h gum, which is not di&s;&s;olved in the water, and keeps it from pa&s;&s;ing through; That <HI>Capuchon</HI> or part of it which comes over the head, comes &s;o clo&s;e under the neck and upon the forehead, that it leaves nothing but the face open: The &s;leeves are ty'd at the wri&s;t, and the lower part of the coat is fa&s;ten'd to the ledge, about the hole of the ve&s;&s;el, with &s;o much care and indu&s;try, that the body thus covered is always dry in the mid&s;t of the waves, which with all their to&s;&s;ing can wet only the face and the hands.</P>
<P>Though they have neither Sail, nor Ma&s;t, nor Rudder, nor Compa&s;s, nor Anchor, nor any thing of all tho&s;e conveniences which are requi&s;ite to make our Ships fit for the Sea; yet will they undertake long voyages with the&s;e &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, upon which they &s;eem to be &s;ewn: they have an experienc'd know|ledg of the Stars, and need no other guide in the night time: The Oars they u&s;e are broad at both ends like a Chirurgeons palet, and that they may the more ea&s;ily make their way through the waves, and la&s;t the longer, they tip them with a white bone which covers the edges of the wood; which or|nament they fa&s;ten with pins of horn, which they u&s;e in&s;tead of nails: The middle of the&s;e Oars is beautifi'd with a bone or precious horn, as well the ends, and by that place they hold them that they may not &s;lip out of their hands: They handle the&s;e double Oars with &s;uch dexterity and nimblene&s;s, that the&s;e &s;mall ve&s;&s;els will out-run Ships that have all the advan|tages of &s;ails, wind, and tide: They are &s;o confident in them, and &s;o vers'd in the guiding of them, that they &s;hew a thou&s;and tricks in them, for the diverti&s;ement of the beholders: Nay &s;ometimes they will rai&s;e &s;uch waves, that the water will be all foamy, as if there had been a great tempe&s;t; and then they &s;eem rather like Sea-mon&s;ters cour&s;ing one another then men: And to make it appear they fear not dangers, and that they hold a good corre&s;pondence with that Element which feeds them, they &s;hew &s;everall tricks, diving and rouling them&s;elves in the Sea three or four times together; &s;o that they may be taken for perfect <HI>Amphibia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="67" MS="y">When they intend to take voyages longer then ordinary, or are afraid to be driven far into the Sea by &s;ome Tempe&s;t, they take with them in the hollow place of their ve&s;&s;el a bladder full of fair water to quench their thir&s;t, and fi&s;h dry'd in the Sun or Fro&s;t to eat in&s;tead of fre&s;h meat: But they are &s;eldom re|duc'd to the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing tho&s;e provi&s;ions; For they have certain Darts like little Lances, which are fa&s;ten'd to their Boats; the&s;e they &s;o dextrou&s;ly ca&s;t at the fi&s;h they meet with, that they are very &s;eldom de&s;titute of the&s;e refre&s;hments: They need no fire to dre&s;s their meat, for on the Land, as well as at Sea, they are wont to eat it raw: They al&s;o carry along with them the teeth of certain great fi&s;hes, or pieces of &s;harp bones, which &s;erve them for knives to dre&s;s and cut the fi&s;h they take: Be&s;ides, another advantage of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els is, that there can happen no mutiny in them, &s;ince one and the &s;ame per&s;on is Ma&s;ter, Mariner, Pur&s;er and Pilot of it, who may &s;top it when he plea&s;es, or let go with the wind &amp; water, when he would take the re&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to retrive his &s;pent forces: In this ca&s;e he fa&s;tens his Oar to certain &s;traps of Hart-&s;kin de&s;ign'd for that purpo&s;e, which are fa&s;tened to the Boat, or el&s;e he ties it to a buckle which hangs before on his coat.</P>
<P>The Women have not the u&s;e of the&s;e little Boats; but that they may al&s;o &s;ometimes divert them&s;elves on the water, their hu&s;bands, who are very fond of them, bring them abroad in other ve&s;&s;els which are about the bigne&s;s of our Shallops or Long-boats, and &s;uch as may carry fifty per&s;ons: They are made of Poles ty'd together, and cover'd with Sea-Dogs &s;kins, as the former: When it is calm they go with Oars, when there is any wind they fa&s;ten the Ma&s;t to certain Sails of Leather.</P>
<P>The Reader may &s;ee among the Sculps of this Chapter a Cut of one of the&s;e Boats, with the per&s;on that conducts it &s;it|ting therein, which may render the de&s;cription we have given of it more intelligible and compleat.</P>
<P>As to the Country where the&s;e excellent Navigators are bred, the degrees under which we have placed it &s;hew it to be of a very cold con&s;titution: Tis true, in the moneths of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> which make the Summer of tho&s;e parts, and are but one continu'd day, (as <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> make but one night) the air is warm, plea&s;ant, and clear, but between tho&s;e two &s;ea&s;ons, the days growing alternately longer and &s;hor|ter, are attended with thick Mi&s;ts, Snow, or Icy-rains, which are extream cold and tedious.</P>
<P>That part of the Country which lyes neer the Sea, is dry, and full of rough and dreadful rocks; and when the Snow melts it is overflown in many places by certain impetuous tor|rents lying between them: But when a man hath travell'd one league of very bad way, he comes into plea&s;ant fields, e&s;peci|ally in the Summer time: There are al&s;o mountains cover'd
<PB N="113" REF="67" MS="y">
with little Trees, which extreamly recreate the eye, and feed abundance of Fowl and Wild-bea&s;ts; and there are Valleys through which there run many clear and plea&s;ant Rivers of fre&s;h water, which have &s;trength enough to make their way into the Sea.</P>
<P>The Captain who commanded the <HI>Flu&s;hinger,</HI> from who&s;e late Voyage we have this Relation, being landed with &s;ome part of his men, and having made a diligent ob&s;ervation there|of, he found there, among other things worth his notice, a vein of a certain browni&s;h earth full of &s;hining &s;pangles, as it were of &s;ilver, wherewith he cau&s;ed a barrel to be filled, that trial might be made thereof: But having been in the crucible, it was found fit only to be put on the covers of Boxes, and &s;uch pieces of Joynery, to which it adds much beauty and lu&s;tre: Yet is there &s;ome hope derived from this di&s;covery, that upon further trial there may be Silver-Mines found in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Though this Country be very cold, yet are there in it many beautiful and large Birds of a black and white plumage, and &s;ome of divers other colours, which the Inhabitants flay that they may have their fle&s;h to eat, and their &s;kins to cloath them|&s;elves withall: There are al&s;o Harts, Elks, Bears, Foxes, Hares, Conies, and abundance of other four-footed bea&s;ts, who&s;e Furs are either black or of a dark grey, very thick, long, &s;oft, and be&s;ides the u&s;es may be made thereof as Furs, excellent for Hats.</P>
<P>Our Relation tells us that the Country is inhabited by two &s;orts of Inhabitants, who live together in perfect friend&s;hip and good corre&s;pondence: Some are of a very high &s;tature, well-&s;hap'd in their bodies, of a pretty clear complexion, and very &s;wift in running: The others are much lower, of a dark Olive-colour'd complexion, and well proportioned as to their members, &s;ave that they have &s;hort and big legs. The former &s;pend their time in Hunting, whereto their activity naturally inclines them, while the latter employ them&s;elves in Fi&s;hing: Both kinds have their teeth very white and clo&s;e, black hair, lively eyes, and their faces &s;uch as that there can no remarka|ble deformity be ob&s;erv'd in them: They are all of them &s;o vi|gorous, and of &s;o healthy a con&s;titution, that many of them being above a hundred years of age are very active and la|borious.</P>
<P>In their ordinary conver&s;ation they &s;eem to be of a cheerful humor, courageous and confident: They love tho&s;e &s;trangers who vi&s;it them, becau&s;e they bring them Needles, Fi&s;hing|hooks, Knives, Hedge-bills, Wedges, and all the other Imple|ments of Iron they have need of, which they &s;o highly e&s;teem that they will give their cloths, and what they account mo&s;t precious for them: but they have &s;uch an aver&s;ion from all no|velty, as to feeding and clothing, that it were hard to induce
<PB N="114" REF="68" MS="y">
them to admit of any change in either: nay though they are one of the poore&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous Nations under the Sun, yet do they think them&s;elves the mo&s;t happy, and be&s;t provi|ded for of any; and they are &s;o well conceited of their manner of life, that the civilities of all other people are accounted by them unbe&s;eeming, &s;avage, and extreamly ridiculous actions.</P>
<P>This high e&s;teem they have conceiv'd of their condition contributes not a little to that &s;atisfaction and tranquility of mind which is legible even in their countenances: be&s;ides that they are not di&s;turb'd by any vain de&s;igns which might inter|rupt their quiet: They know nothing of tho&s;e gnawing cares and pinching di&s;tractions wherewith the inordinate de&s;ire of wealth torments the greate&s;t part of mankind. The conveni|ences of fair and &s;umptuous buildings, the fame attending gal|lant actions, the delights of great entertainments, the know|ledg of excellent things, and what we think mo&s;t advances the plea&s;ure and enjoyments of life, having not yet found the way into the&s;e Countries, their thoughts accordingly are not trou|bled about the acqui&s;ition thereof: but to get tho&s;e things which are preci&s;ely nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and clothing, with as little trouble as may be, is the end of all their con&s;ulta|tations and de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Exerci&s;es, nay indeed Employments, are Fi&s;hing and Hunting; and though they have no Fire-arms nor Nets, yet ingenious and inventive Nece&s;&s;ity hath in&s;pir'd them with other ways whereby they effect their de&s;ires. They eat what&s;oever they feed on without any dre&s;&s;ing, or any other &s;auce then hunger: nay they laugh at tho&s;e who boil fi&s;h or fle&s;h, affirming that the fire takes away the natural ta&s;te there|of, and what makes them acceptable to them.</P>
<P>Though they need no fire to dre&s;s their meat, yet they very much commend the u&s;e of it, and their Caves are not de&s;titute of it in the winter time; both by its light to abate &s;omwhat of the tediou&s;ne&s;s of that long night which reigns in their Coun|try, and by its heat the cold whereby they are be&s;ieged of all &s;ides: But when they take their re&s;t, or are forc'd to go out of their Caves, they put on a certain Fur, which by the excellent di&s;po&s;al of Divine Providence &s;ecures them again&s;t the inju|ries of the cold, though they lay in the mid&s;t of the &s;now.</P>
<P>The mens cloths, are a Shirt, a pair of Breeches, a &s;hort Coat, and a kind of Bu&s;kins: The Shirt comes but a little be|low the Wa&s;te: It hath a Capuchon, or Cap annexed to it, to come over the head and neck: It is made of the bladders of great fi&s;hes cut into long pieces of equal bredth, and very neatly &s;ewn together: It hath no opening at the brea&s;t as ours have; but that it may not rent when it is put on, the ends of the &s;leeves, the head-piece, and the bottom of it are hemm'd</P>

in with a very thin black &s;kin; as it is repre&s;ented among the Bra&s;s-cuts.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of their cloths, even their Bu&s;kins, are of &s;everal pieces cut proportionably one to another, as their Shirts are; but they are of a &s;tronger &s;tuff, to wit, Harts-&s;kins, or Sea-dogs|&s;kins very well dre&s;s'd with the hair on: The cloaths of the Sa|vage who&s;e pourtrait is to be &s;een among the Sculps, taken by the Original, were of Leather of two &s;everal colours, the pieces were cut of the &s;ame bredth, and put together &s;o hand&s;omly, that a white piece was &s;ewn between two dark colour'd pieces, which &s;hew'd very prettily: The hair which was on the out|&s;ide was as &s;mooth and as &s;oft as Velvet, and the &s;everal pieces were &s;o neatly joyn'd together, that a man would think by the out-&s;ide that the Garment was all made of the &s;ame &s;kin. As to the fa&s;hion of the Coat, and the external ornaments of the Savage, the Graver hath &s;o naturally repre&s;ented them in the Sculp, that we need not trouble the Reader with any further de&s;cription thereof.</P>
<P>The Savages inhabiting about the fore&s;aid Streight never go abroad into the Country but they have at their back a Quiver full of Arrows, and a Bow or a Lance in their hands: Their Arrows are of &s;everal kinds, &s;ome are for the killing of Hares, Foxes, great Birds, and all &s;orts of &s;mall Game; others for Harts, Elks, Bears, and other greater Bea&s;ts: The former are not above two or three foot in length, and in&s;tead of iron at the top they put a &s;mall &s;harp bone, which on one of the &s;ides hath three or four little hooks, &s;o that it cannot be taken out of the place wounded without widening the wound: The lat|ter, which are at lea&s;t four or five foot long, have al&s;o at the end a &s;harp bone jagged like the teeth of a Saw: They ca&s;t the&s;e latter with the hand; but to give them the greater force, and make them do execution at a greater di&s;tance, they fa&s;ten to their right arm a piece of wood a foot and a half long, which on one &s;ide hath a deep channel into which they put the butt|end of the Javelin, which being ca&s;t thence goes off with a greater violence.</P>
<P>They &s;ometimes al&s;o carry in their hands a kind of Lance, of a tough and heavy wood, which is tipp'd at the &s;maller end with a round bone, the point whereof had been &s;harpened on a &s;tone, or they &s;trengthen it with the horns or teeth of the fi&s;h before de&s;cribed: The&s;e Lances are &s;even or eight foot in length, and beautifi&punc;d at the butt-end with two little wings of wood, or Whale-bone, which make them a little more &s;ight|ly then they would be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;everal &s;orts of hooks wherewith they take the &s;maller fi&s;hes frequenting their Coa&s;ts, they have divers kinds of Javelins, which with a wonderful dexterity they dart at the great and mon&s;trous fi&s;hes they take in the Sea: And that
<PB N="116" REF="70" MS="y">
tho&s;e they have hurt with the&s;e Darts may not &s;ink to the bot|tom, and elude their expectation, there is fa&s;ten'd to the butt|end of them a thong of Harts-leather 25 or 30 fathom in length, and at the end of that thong or line of leather there is a bladder, which keeping above water &s;hews where the fi&s;h is, and &s;o they draw it to them, or gently drag it to land after it hath &s;pent it &s;elf in &s;trugling.</P>
<P>The young women differ not much in their cloaths from the men; but the more ancient are commonly clad with the &s;kins of certain great Birds, who&s;e feathers are white and black, and very ordinary in tho&s;e parts. The&s;e women have the art to flay them &s;o neatly, that the feathers &s;tay in the &s;kin: The&s;e cloaths reach but to half the leg: They are girt with a thong of leather, at which in&s;tead of keys there hang a great many little bones as &s;harp as any bodkins, and about that length: They wear neither Bracelets, nor Neck-laces, nor Pendants; nor mind any ornament, &s;ave that they make a ga&s;h in each cheek, and fill it with a certain black colour, which as they think adds very much to their beauty.</P>
<P>While the men are a hunting or fi&s;hing they &s;tay at home, and employ them&s;elves in making of Cloths, Tents, Ba&s;kets, and &s;uch things as are nece&s;&s;ary about the hou&s;e: They are extreamly fond of their little ones, and if they be forc'd to change their habitations, or to accompany their hu&s;bands in &s;ome jour|ney, they either carry or lead them where-ever they go, and to recreate them by the way, and quiet them when they cry, they have little drums cover'd with fi&s;hes bladders, on which they can make as good Mu&s;ick as any on the Taber: They al&s;o beat them to frighten away the Bears, and other wild Bea&s;ts which wander up and down neer the Caves where the&s;e Sa|vages pa&s;s over the Winter with their families, and about the Tents where they are lodg'd in the Summer. Among the Sculps of this Chapter there is the pourtraiture of one of the&s;e women, to which we refer the Reader for further &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e poor Barbarians cannot be imagin'd to &s;tudy much Policy, yet have they among them petty Kings and Cap|tains, who pre&s;ide in all their A&s;&s;emblies: They advance to the&s;e dignities tho&s;e who have the hand&s;ome&s;t bodies, are the be&s;t Hunts-men, and the mo&s;t valiant: The&s;e wear the riche&s;t Skins and more precious Furs then their Subjects; and as a badge of their Supremacy they have a certain badge which is &s;own before on their Coats, and when they go abroad they are always attended by certain young men arm'd with Bows and Arrows, who punctually execute their commands.</P>
<P>They have not the invention of building hou&s;es; but in the Summer they live in the fields under Tents of Leather, which they carry along with them to be pitch'd where they think it
<PB N="117" REF="70" MS="y">
mo&s;t convenient; and in Winter their abode is in Caves, which are naturally made in the Mountains, or they have taken the pains to make &s;uch.</P>
<P>They neither Sow nor Reap any kind of Grain in order to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: Nor have they any Trees or Plants bear|ing fruits fit to eat, unle&s;s it be &s;ome Straw-berries, and a kind of Ra&s;pices; but indeed their livelihood depends wholly on their Fi&s;hing and Hunting: Fair water is their ordinary drink, and their mo&s;t delicate entertainment, as to drink, is the blood of Sea-dogs, and that of Deer, and other Land-crea|tures, which they either kill or take in Traps, at the &s;etting of which they have an admirable indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The Winter being &s;o long and hard in this Country, the In|habitants mu&s;t needs &s;uffer great inconveniences during that &s;ea&s;on, e&s;pecially that tedious night which keeps them in two whole moneths: But be&s;ides that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they en|dure hunger a long time, they have this fore&s;ight that in the Summer they dry &s;ome part of their fi&s;hing and hunting, and lay it up with as much Fat and Suet as they can get together, in order to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during that comfortle&s;s time: Nay &s;ome affirm they are &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in their hunting by Moon|light, that they are &s;eldom de&s;titute of fre&s;h meat, even during this long Eclip&s;e.</P>
<P>They de&s;ire not to &s;ee any other Country be&s;ides that they were born in, and if a tempe&s;t or other accident chance to ca&s;t them upon &s;ome other, they perpetually &s;igh after their own, and are never quiet in their minds till they have recover'd it: If they are deny'd or too long delay'd that favour, they will attempt it with the hazard of their lives, expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the Sea in their little Ve&s;&s;els without any other guide then the Stars, by which they regulate their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Language hath nothing common with any other in the World; there is a Vocabulary of it, but not to be publi&s;h'd till there be a further di&s;covery made of the&s;e parts; what is &s;aid here thereof being only by way of digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor hath it been yet ob&s;erved what Religion they have among them; but from their, looking towards the Sun, and their pointing at him with a certain admiration, lifting up their hands on high, it is inferr'd that they account him a God.</P>
<P>The Ship from which we have this Relation, brought from <HI>Davis-&s;treight</HI> &s;everal con&s;iderable Commodities, whereof we &s;hall here give a Li&s;t, to &s;hew that the cold which reigns in that Country is not &s;o in&s;upportable as to freeze up all manner of Commerce in tho&s;e parts.</P>

<ITEM>4. Several Packs of Whale-bone of extraordinary length.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Some compleat &s;uits of Cloths of the Inhabitants of the Country, whereof &s;ome were of the &s;kins of Bea&s;ts, others of tho&s;e of Birds, of the fa&s;hion before repre&s;ented.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Many of their Shirts made of Fi&s;hes Bladders very neatly &s;ew'd; as al&s;o Caps, Gloves, and Bu&s;kins, Quivers, Arrows, Bows, and other Arms u&s;ed by them; as al&s;o &s;ome of their Tents, Bags, Ba&s;kets, and other little pieces of Hou&s;|hold-&s;tuff.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. A great number of tho&s;e &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els made to carry only one man: A great Boat or Shallop forty five foot in length, which might conveniently carry fifty per&s;ons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. But the mo&s;t rare and precious Commodity was a very con&s;iderable quantity of the Teeth or Horns of the fi&s;hes called Sea-Unicorns, which are thought to be the large&s;t, the faire&s;t and the mo&s;t exactly proportion'd of any that have yet been &s;een.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Some of them were &s;ent to <HI>Paris,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where they were well receiv'd: Nor is it unlikely but that they will be much more highly e&s;teemed, when the admirable ver|tues they have in Phy&s;ick are known: For though their beau|ty and rarity may procure them the be&s;t places in the Clo&s;ets of the Curious; yet will they be more kindly received there, when &s;ome others have found true what many famous Phy&s;i|cians and Apothecaries of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> who have made trial thereof upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, unanimou&s;ly affirm of them, to wit, that they expell poy&s;on, and have all the properties commonly attributed to the Land-Unicorn's Horn.</P>

<P>TO dive into the deep Secrets of the Waters to take a view of all the excellent Creatures &s;porting them&s;elves therein, and ob&s;erve the vertues and occult qualities wherewith they are endow'd, is a work might be expected from that Wi&s;dom which was communicated to <HI>Solomon,</HI> who treat|ed of Trees, from the Cedar in <HI>Libanon</HI> to the Hy&s;&s;op growing on the Wall: For the watery Element is furni&s;hed with &s;uch a miraculous plenty, that it abundantly produces not only Fi&s;hes of &s;everal kinds fit for the &s;u&s;tenance of man, and tho&s;e of ex|traordinary bulk and mon&s;trous figures, as hath been &s;hewn in the precedent Chapters, but al&s;o &s;uch a multitude of precious Shells, and other Rarities, that we may well acknowledg that the Divine Wi&s;dom hath di&s;play'd all the&s;e rich beauties of its inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ures, to &s;hew its Omnipotency in the mid&s;t of the Waves, and gently to win us into an admiration of his Goodne&s;s and adorable Providence, which humbles it &s;elf to de&s;cend into the Aby&s;&s;es of the Sea to people them with &s;ome excellent Creatures not to be &s;een el&s;ewhere, and an infinite number of others bearing the Characters and Idaeas of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Bodies that either adorn the Heavens, flye in the Air, or embelli&s;h the Earth. Hence it comes, that there are found in the Waters, Stars, Cornets, Trumpets, Purcelains, Trees, Apples, Che&s;t-nuts, and all the delightful curio&s;ities which are &s;o highly e&s;teemed among men. But to begin with the Shell-fi&s;h, there are in the Seas about, and in the Rivers of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> &s;everal kinds of them: The more particularly e&s;teemed are the <HI>Homars,</HI> the <HI>Sea-Spiders,</HI> and the <HI>Crabs.</HI></P>

Their jagged edges are turned inwards, and though all are not equally beautiful, yet are they all of the &s;ame oval figure, gaping in the mid&s;t, and turning in a little: But they are very different as to bigne&s;s and colour.</P>
<P>The ordinary ones are of a gilt-yellow, checquer'd with lit|tle white or red &s;pots, &s;o as that at a di&s;tance a man would think them little Pearls, or grains of Coral: Of the re&s;t, &s;ome are blewi&s;h, &s;ome as it were be&s;et with &s;tars, &s;ome greyi&s;h, &s;ome like Chry&s;tal, and &s;ome colour'd like Agats, which are all delightful to the eye.</P>

<P>It is not ea&s;ie to determine whether the dew which falls in the <HI>Caribbies</HI> be not fruitful enough to make the <HI>Mother-Pearl</HI> produce its fruit in perfection; or whether after it hath re|ceiv'd that &s;eed from the Heavens they mi&s;carry, and have not natural force enough to retain it: But not to enquire whence the defect proceeds, it is mo&s;t certain they have as &s;trong an in|clination to avoid the reproach of &s;terility, as tho&s;e fi&s;h'd for on the Coa&s;ts of S. <HI>Margarets:</HI> For he who will be at the curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve their &s;ecret Loves from the rocks, at the foot where|of they mo&s;t delight to be, &s;hall find, that at the break of day they &s;tart up &s;everal times to the &s;urface of the water, as it were to do homage to the Ri&s;ing-Sun; then of a &s;udden they open them&s;elves upon that &s;oft bed, expecting the fir&s;t beams of that all-enlivening Star: If they be &s;o happy as to receive &s;ome drops of the dew he cau&s;es to di&s;till from the Heavens at his ri&s;ing, they immediately clo&s;e their &s;hells, le&s;t any touch of &s;alt-water come in, and corrupt that cele&s;tial &s;perm: And then they cheerfully return to their deep cells.</P>

<P>But not to enter into any conte&s;tation with the&s;e Gentle|men, nor yet ab&s;olutely to reject their opinion which hath its grounds, we may affirm, that the true account given by <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> of the fi&s;hing for Pearls makes nothing again&s;t the opinion commonly receiv'd of their generation; for it is not impo&s;&s;ible but that the Mother-Pearls which have conceived of the Dew, feeling them&s;elves burthened with that precious fruit, have no great inclination to appear ever afterwards on the &s;urface of the waters; and being &s;atisfi'd with the trea&s;ure they are po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of, they from thenceforth fa&s;ten them&s;elves to the rocks, whence they cannot be gotten off without violence.</P>

There are al&s;o tho&s;e who conceive it to be a kind of Sea-foam, which gathers toge|ther and grows thick after a certain time by the agitation of the Sea-water, and is hardned by the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t probable conjecture is, that it is a kind of <HI>Bitumen</HI> engendred at the bottom of the Sea; and when it comes to be extremely agitated by &s;ome extraordinary tem|pe&s;t, it lets go this Bitumen, and forces it towards the &s;hores: for indeed it is commonly found only after &s;ome great tempe&s;t. <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> in the life of <HI>Apollonius</HI> affirms, that the Panthers which are neer the Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> are very much delighted with the &s;weet &s;cent of that place: But certain it is, that of all creatures the Birds are very great lovers of this Amber|greece, and that they will &s;cent it at a great di&s;tance: Where|fore as &s;oon as the tempe&s;t is laid it mu&s;t be &s;ought after and taken away, otherwi&s;e it will be devoured. Nor is it the &s;weet &s;cent of it, but the ill, which cau&s;es the Birds to flock to it; for this precious and admirable perfume, when it is fre&s;h and &s;oft, and newly come out of the Sea, &s;mells very &s;trong, and tho&s;e creatures which run to it do but as they would do to &s;ome carrion; for the &s;cent of it is like that of ru&s;ty bacon,
<PB N="129" REF="77">
and 'tis likely for that rea&s;on that it was &s;o long ere 'twas known and u&s;ed: The Ancients judg'd of its vertue by its ill &s;cent, fit rather to injure the heart then refre&s;h it, and &s;o they rejected it as unprofitable, nay hurtful. Be&s;ides it is not &s;o commonly, nor in &s;o great quantities found towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Greece,</HI> nor yet in <HI>Europe;</HI> and there were but very few Voy|ages heretofore made into the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Foxes do al&s;o think it a good di&s;h, and eat much of it: In tho&s;e Countries where much of it is gather'd, the&s;e creatures wait at the Sea-&s;ide, and having di&s;cover'd any, they immedi|ately devour it: But having kept it a while in their bellies, they ca&s;t it up again before it be any way dige&s;ted; yet does it lo&s;e &s;ome of its vertue and &s;weet &s;cent: Whence it comes, that this kind of Amber-greece is le&s;s e&s;teem'd then the other, and us'd only in perfumes.</P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s hereto give the marks whereby the true Amber-greece is to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the adulterate, &s;ince tho&s;e who have written of it, as <HI>Garcias, Monard, Scaliger, Ferdinand Lopez, Clu&s;ius,</HI> and others, &s;peak very little thereof, and a&s;&s;ign not the e&s;&s;ential marks of it.</P>
<P>It is in the fir&s;t place to be ob&s;erv'd, that Amber-greece is generally di&s;tingui&s;h'd into that which comes from the <HI>Levant</HI> Seas, and that which comes from the We&s;tern Sea: That which is taken up on the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Levant,</HI> e&s;pecially on tho&s;e of <HI>Barbary,</HI> where there is much, and in great pieces had, is for the mo&s;t part black, and cannot be dried &s;o well as to be reduc'd to powder, as that of the We&s;t, let what will be ad|ded to promote the pulverization of it: It is al&s;o more ea&s;ily melted by the fire, hath not &s;o &s;weet a &s;cent, and is of a lower value: There is little of the Amber brought into the&s;e parts, in regard it is not much e&s;teem'd, and not very u&s;eful either as to Phy&s;ick, or Perfumes.</P>
<P>The Amber-greece of the We&s;t, whereof the be&s;t is that found on our Coa&s;ts, is commonly of an a&s;h-colour'd grey, looking as if a&s;hes were mixt with wax, yet &s;o as that the a&s;hes appear di&s;tinctly, and are not perfectly mixt with the wax: The upper part of it having raked along the &s;hore, and lain more open to the air, is commonly of a tawny colour, or at lea&s;t not &s;o white as it is within, hard and &s;olid like a cru&s;t, and &s;ometimes full of &s;and and little &s;hells: which happens hence, that being &s;oft as Bitumen or Pitch, &s;uch filth ea&s;ily &s;ticks to it; and that abates &s;omwhat of its price, but not of its goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>To know whether this Amber, which is of the be&s;t kind, be good, in the fir&s;t place con&s;ider the figure of it, which for the mo&s;t part &s;hould incline to roundne&s;s, ina&s;much as all things that are any way &s;oft being to&s;s'd to and fro by the Sea are reduc'd to a certain roundne&s;s: It &s;hould be al&s;o &s;omewhat
<PB N="130" REF="78">
&s;mooth, and of a dark colour between a dark-grey and tawny: If it be very dry it &s;hould be the lighter, proportionably to the bigne&s;s of the piece: Hereby it may be judg'd whether there be any mixture of Scamony, Bitumen, Wax, Pitch, or Ro|zin, all the&s;e adding much to its weight: By the &s;ame tryal it may be known whether there be any mixture of &s;and; as al&s;o whether it be not the black Amber-greece of the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>If the Owners of it are unwilling to have the piece broken, take a needle heated, and thru&s;t it into the piece, and if it enter ea&s;ily, conclude there are no &s;tones within it; and if you &s;mell at the liquor which will come forth by the heat of the needle whereby the Amber is melted, you will find it of a &s;cent not unlike that of gumm'd wax, but at la&s;t will end in an odour &s;weet enough.</P>
<P>But the &s;ure&s;t way is, having agreed about the price of the piece of Amber conditionally it be good, to break it; &s;o you will find whether there be any &s;mall pebbles in it. The Amber, as we &s;aid before, mu&s;t be of an a&s;h-colour, having &s;mall &s;pecks, as our Water-nuts: When it is fre&s;h it is of a darker colour then when it is very dry: but if it differ not much from that colour, and be not too black nor too white, it matters not; above all it &s;hould appear of a mixt colour: Take al&s;o a little out of the middle of the piece, or from that part which you think wor&s;t, and put it on a knife heated in the fire, and it will pre&s;ently melt like wax, and if the knife be very hot what was put upon it will be quite con&s;um'd.</P>
<P>When you have thus melted it, ob&s;erve whether it hath the &s;cent we mentioned, which cannot be well known but only to &s;uch as have made tryal thereof, becau&s;e it is particular there|to; and by that means you will al&s;o di&s;cover whether there be any mixture in the Amber: You may al&s;o while it is melting put a little upon your hand, and &s;preading it you may &s;ee whe|ther there be any mixture: It &s;hould &s;tick &s;o fa&s;t to your hand that it can hardly be got off: When it melts it becomes all of one colour, though before it &s;eemed to be mixt, and inclines to that of &s;ome kind of Rozin: It &s;hould not di&s;&s;olve in either water or oyl; not but that there is a way to di&s;&s;olve it in either of them, by the addition of a certain ingredient, which tho&s;e who know it would not have di&s;cover'd: Nor &s;hould it be re|duc'd to powder, unle&s;s being very dry it may be &s;craped or grated, and be mixt with &s;ome fine powder: It al&s;o &s;ticks much to the Mortar, which therefore mu&s;t be often made clean: The black will never be reduc'd to powder, neither this, nor any other way.</P>
<P>The difference between the black and the grey con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the colour, which inclines to that of black pitch, and not mixt with whiti&s;h-grey &s;eeds, but all over alike: The black is al&s;o &s;ofter and more weighty, and &s;mells more like <HI>Bitumen.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="131" REF="79" MS="y">There is a third kind of Amber-greece, which is white, the rare&s;t, as <HI>Ferdinand Lopez</HI> affirms, but not the be&s;t as he ac|counts it. On the contrary, it is the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable of any, and there being no account made of it, there is very lit|tle tran&s;ported: But this is indeed &s;ome of the other kinds of Amber-greece, which having been devoured and dige&s;ted by Birds that have very hot &s;tomacks, turns white, as mo&s;t of the excrements of Birds are: That which hath been devour'd by Fi&s;hes, as it happens many times, is not much alter'd either as to colour or &s;ub&s;tance: which proceeds hence, that their &s;to|macks are not &s;o hot as tho&s;e of the Birds, and perhaps finding the Amber-greece hotter then their ordinary &s;u&s;tenance, and burthen'd therewith, they &s;oon ca&s;t it up again: But what had been eaten by the Fox is in a manner corrupted, and of little value, by rea&s;on of the heat of his &s;tomack.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> Of certain Creatures living partly on Land, partly in the Waters, commonly called <HI>Amphibia,</HI> which may be found in the <HI>Caribby-I&s;lands.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall begin with the <HI>Crocodile,</HI> by the I&s;landers cal|led <HI>Cayeman:</HI> It is a very dangerous Mon&s;ter, which &s;ometimes grows to an extraordinary bulk and length: The Skeletons of &s;everal of them being frequently brought into the&s;e parts, we &s;hall not be &s;o large in our de&s;crip|tion thereof, as otherwi&s;e we might.</P>
<P>This Creature keeps in or neer the Sea, and in the Rivers of the I&s;lands that are not inhabited, and &s;ometimes on the Land among the Reeds, very hideous to look on: It is conceiv'd to live a long time, and that its body encrea&s;eth in all its dimen&s;i|ons to the very la&s;t day: Whence it is not to be wondred, if there have been &s;een of them &s;ome which were eighteen foot in length, and as big about as a Hog&s;head: It hath four feet
<PB N="132" REF="80" MS="y">
well arm'd with crooked claws: The &s;kin, which is cover'd all over with &s;cales, is &s;o hard on the back, that a bullet from a Mu&s;ket &s;hot at him &s;hall hardly make any impre&s;&s;ion on it: but if he be hurt under the belly, or in the eyes, he is &s;oon gone: His lower jaw is immoveable, but hath &s;o wide a mouth, and &s;o well &s;et with &s;harp teeth, that he makes nothing to divide a man in two.</P>
<P>He runs fa&s;t enough on land; but the weight of his body cau&s;es him to make &s;o deep a track in the &s;and, as a Coach-hor&s;e might do; and having no <HI>vertebrae</HI> in the back-bone, no more then the <HI>Hyaena</HI>'s, he goes &s;treight forwards, not being able to turn his va&s;t body, but with much difficulty; &s;o that the better to avoid his pur&s;uit, a man need only turn &s;everal times a &s;ide.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which are bred in fre&s;h water do &s;o &s;mell of Mu&s;k while they are alive, that the air is perfum'd a hundred paces about the place where they are: nay the water retains &s;omwhat of the &s;ame &s;mell. This ob&s;ervation of the &s;weet &s;cent of the Crocodile may, by the way, di&s;cover the error of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who imagin'd that of all living creatures only the <HI>Panther</HI> had a &s;weet &s;cent with it, as he &s;omewhere affirms, though in ano|ther place he writes, that the entrails of the Crocodile &s;mell ve|ry &s;weet, and that proceeds from the odoriferous flowers on which he feeds: Now this mu&s;ky &s;cent of the Crocodile of <HI>America</HI> is enclos'd in certain glandules in the Emunctories, which he hath under the thighs, and which being taken thence keep the &s;aid &s;mell a long time: It may be imagin'd that God hath be&s;tow'd this &s;cent on them, that men and other creatures, which many times become the prey of the&s;e cruel Mon&s;ters, might by the &s;cent di&s;cover the place where they lurk, and avoid them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which have their abode in the Sea have no &s;mell of mu&s;k, but both kinds are very dangerous, and to be dreaded by &s;uch as either go to wa&s;h them&s;elves, or are forc'd to cro&s;s &s;ome river by &s;wimming: This dreadful Mon&s;ter hath a &s;trange &s;leight to make his prey of Oxen and Cows: One of them will lye lurking at tho&s;e places of the Ponds and Rivers where tho&s;e creatures are wont to water, and finding one at his advantage, he half-&s;huts his eyes, and floats on the face of the water, as if it were a piece of rotten wood; by which means getting neerer and neerer to the poor bea&s;t which is a drinking, and is not aware of him, he immediately fa&s;tens on him, ta|king him by the lips, and forcing him under water, he drowns him, and then feeds on him: He taketh men al&s;o by the &s;ame &s;leight, as is affirmed by <HI>Vincent le Blanc,</HI> who hath a Relation of the &s;ervant of a Con&s;ul of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> who going to take one of the&s;e cruel bea&s;ts, thinking it had been a piece of wood, was drawn by it to the bottom, and never &s;een afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="80">There are abundance of the&s;e mon&s;trous Crocodiles in tho&s;e I&s;lands, which from them are called the I&s;lands of <HI>Cayeman,</HI> and not frequented but only in the time of Tortoi&s;e-fi&s;hing: For having pick'd out the be&s;t meat out of the Tortoi&s;e, and a great deal ca&s;t away, the Crocodiles come in great numbers in the night time to feed on the entrails and carca&s;es left on the &s;and: So that tho&s;e who are watching for the Tortoi&s;es are oblig'd to carry about them great wooden Leavers to keep off tho&s;e <HI>Cayemans,</HI> which they many times kill, having fir&s;t broken their backs with tho&s;e Leavers.</P>
<P>The&s;e creatures have a whiti&s;h fat, which was heretofore u&s;ed by Phy&s;icians in fluxions proceeding from a cold cau&s;e; it being hot, and con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ubtile parts: Upon the &s;ame account were &s;uch as had Fevers rubb'd therewith upon the approach of their fits, to cau&s;e &s;weating: Many other properties are attri|buted to the Crocodile by <HI>Pliny,</HI> in order to the curing of di&s;|ea&s;es: Some are very de&s;irous to get certain little &s;tones, like little bones, which are in his head, and having reduced them to powder, they u&s;e them to clear the Reins of Gravel: Some al&s;o affirm, that the &s;harpe&s;t teeth of this Animal, which are on the &s;ide of each jaw, cure the Tooth-ach, and pre|&s;erve the teeth from corruption, being only rubbed every day therewith: There are in like manner in the heads of Dragons, and Toads, &s;tones good again&s;t &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es: So the cruel <HI>Requiems,</HI> by us before de&s;cribed, afford a remedy again&s;t the Stone and Gravel. Thus hath it pleas'd the wi&s;e Author of Nature, that we &s;hould have &s;ome advantages from tho&s;e creatures which are otherwi&s;e mo&s;t pernicious.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have a way to take and tame the&s;e Crocodiles, as &s;ome Hi&s;torians affirm: And when they have bred them a cer|tain time, and made them fat enough, they kill them, and feed on them: But the <HI>Europeans</HI> who have ta&s;ted thereof, affirm, their fle&s;h, though white and delicate, is not plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te, as being too lu&s;hious, &s;weeti&s;h, and retaining much of the mu&s;k.</P>

<HEAD>TORTOISES.</HEAD>
<P>THere are taken in the&s;e I&s;lands &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Tortoi&s;es,</HI> for there are <HI>Land-Tortoi&s;es, Sea-Tortoi&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Fre&s;h|water-Tortoi&s;es,</HI> which are of different figures: The <HI>Caribbians</HI> call them all by the name of <HI>Catallou;</HI> but when they &s;peak of the Land-Tortoi&s;es, they adde the word <HI>Nonum,</HI> which in their Language &s;ignifies the Earth, or that of <HI>Tona,</HI> that is to &s;ay, of the River or Water.</P>
<P>The Sea-Tortoi&s;es are commonly divided by the I&s;landers into three kinds, that which the French call <HI>Tortue Franche,</HI> that called <HI>Caouanne,</HI> and the <HI>Carets:</HI> They are all of them al|mo&s;t
<PB N="134" REF="81" MS="y">
of the &s;ame figure; but the meat only of the fir&s;t kind is good to be eaten, unle&s;s it be in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and for want of other provi&s;ion; &s;o that of the two la&s;t, only the &s;hell is of value.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tortue-Franche,</HI> and the <HI>Caouannes</HI> are commonly of &s;o va&s;t a bulk, that the upper &s;hell is about four foot and a half in length, and four in bredth: Which is not to be much ad|mired, &s;ince that in <HI>Maurice-I&s;land</HI> there are &s;ome which having four men on their backs, are neverthele&s;s able to go. <HI>Aelian</HI> relates, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Taprobana</HI> cover their hou&s;es therewith: And if we may credit <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> certain Nations of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> convert them into Boats, in which they will cro&s;s a great arm of the Sea that lies between them and the Continent.</P>
<P>The&s;e Amphibious creatures &s;eldom come to Land, but on|ly to di&s;po&s;e of their Egges, in order to propagation: To that end they make choice of a very light &s;and which they find on the Sea-&s;ide, in &s;ome place not much frequented, and to which they may have ea&s;ie acce&s;s.</P>
<P>The I&s;landers, who at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year go to the <HI>Cayeman-I&s;lands,</HI> to make provi&s;ion of the meat of Tor|toi&s;es which come to land there in infinite numbers, affirm, that they make their recour&s;e thither from all parts within a hun|dred leagues and more to lay their egges, by rea&s;on of the ea&s;ine&s;s of the acce&s;s, the &s;hore being flat, and cover'd with a &s;oft &s;and: The Tortoi&s;es come to land about the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> and their landing continues till <HI>September,</HI> and then may they be taken in abundance; which is thus performed.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the evening &s;ome men are &s;et a&s;hore, who lying on the &s;ands without making any noi&s;e, watch the Tor|toi&s;es when they come out of the Sea to lay their egges in the &s;and; and when they perceive that they are got a good way from the Sea-&s;ide, and hear them making a deep hole in the &s;and with their claws, into which being a foot and a half deep, and &s;ometimes more, they lay the egges, they come and &s;ur|prize them at that employment, and turn them up&s;ide-down; and being in that po&s;ture they are not able to recover them|&s;elves, but continue &s;o till the next day that they are brought thence in Shallops to the Ships: When they are thus turned up&s;ide-down, they are ob&s;erv'd to &s;hed tears, and are heard to &s;igh. 'Tis generally known that the Stag weeps when he is put to his extremities: And it is almo&s;t incredible what cries and groans proceed from the Crocodiles about the <HI>Nile,</HI> and what tears they &s;hed when they find them&s;elves taken.</P>
<P>The Sea-men of tho&s;e Ships which go to the <HI>Cayeman-I&s;lands</HI> to take in their loading of Tortoi&s;es, may every night in le&s;s then three hours turn forty or fifty of them, the lea&s;t whereof weighs a hundred and fifty pound, and the ordinary ones two
<PB N="135" REF="81" MS="y">
hundred pound; nay &s;ome of them will have two great pails full of egges in their bellies: The&s;e egges are round, and about the bigne&s;s of a Tennis-ball; they have white and yolk like Hens-egges, but the &s;hell is not &s;o hard, but &s;oft, feeling as if it were wet parchment. The <HI>Frica&s;&s;eys</HI> and <HI>Omeletts</HI> made of them are good enough, but a little drier then tho&s;e made with Hens-egges. There is &s;o much meat about one Tortoi&s;e as may well maintain &s;ixty per&s;ons a whole day: When they are de&s;irous to eat of them, they cut off the &s;hell which is under the belly from that on the back, unto which it is joyn'd by certain gri&s;tles which are ea&s;ily cut: What Tor|toi&s;es are taken by the Sea-men in the night, finds them work all day to cut into pieces and &s;alt them. Mo&s;t of the Ships which come to the&s;e <HI>Cayeman-I&s;lands,</HI> after they have taken in their loading, that is, after &s;ix weeks or two moneths continu|ance there, return to the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> where they &s;ell that &s;alted Tortoi&s;e; and it becomes the &s;u&s;tenance of the ordinary &s;ort of people, and the &s;laves.</P>
<P>But the Tortoi&s;es that have e&s;caped, having laid their egges at two or three &s;everal times, return to the place whence they came, the egges which they have cover'd with &s;and on the Sea-&s;ide being about &s;ix weeks after hatch'd by the heat of the Sun, and not by their looking on them, as <HI>Pliny,</HI> and &s;ome of the Ancients imagined: as &s;oon as the young Tortoi&s;es have broken the &s;hells wherein they were inclos'd, they make their way through the &s;and, and get out of the grave which gave them birth, and by an in&s;tinct of nature go &s;treight to the Sea to the old ones.</P>
<P>The meat of this kind of Tortoi&s;e is as dainty as any Veal, &s;o it be fre&s;h, and kept but one day: It is intermixt with fat, which when it is dre&s;s'd is of a greeni&s;h yellow: It is of ea&s;ie dige&s;tion, and very whol&s;om, whence it comes, that tho&s;e &s;ick per&s;ons who cannot recover in the other I&s;lands are carried to that purpo&s;e to the <HI>Cayemans</HI> in the Ships that go for Tor|toi&s;es; and commonly having refre&s;h'd, and purg'd them&s;elves with that diet, they return thence perfectly recover'd. The fat of this kind of Tortoi&s;e yields an oyl, which while it is fre&s;h is good enough to fry withall, being &s;tale it is employ'd in Lamps.</P>

<P>THe third kind of Sea-Tortoi&s;e, called by the French <HI>Ca|ret,</HI> differs from the two others in bigne&s;s, as being much le&s;s, and that it lays not its egges in the &s;and, but in a kind of gravel which is mixt with &s;mall pebbles: The meat of this Tortoi&s;e is not plea&s;ant, but the egges more delicate then tho&s;e of the other two kinds: It would be as little regarded as the <HI>Caouanne,</HI> were it not &s;ought after for its precious &s;hell: It con&s;i&s;ts of fifteen greater and le&s;&s;er leaves or pieces, ten where|of are flat and even, four a little bending, and that which co|vers the neck, made triangle-wi&s;e, hollow like a little buckler: All the &s;hells of an ordinary <HI>Caret</HI> may weigh three or four pound; but there have been &s;ome taken who&s;e &s;hells have been &s;o large and &s;o thick, that all together have weigh'd about &s;ix or &s;even pounds.</P>
<P>Of the &s;hell of this kind of Tortoi&s;e are made Combs, Cups, Boxes, Ca&s;es, Cabinets, and &s;o many excellent things of great price: It al&s;o enriches Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, the borders of Looking|gla&s;&s;es and Pictures, and is u&s;ed now in the covering of Pocket|books of Devotion. To get this precious &s;hell, they put a lit|tle fire under the upper &s;hell which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;o many pieces; and as &s;oon as they feel the heat they are ea&s;ily taken off with the point of a knife.</P>
<P>Some affirm, that this kind of Tortoi&s;e is &s;o vigorous, that its &s;hell being taken away it will get another if it be immediate|ly ca&s;t into the Sea. The mo&s;t plentiful fi&s;hing for the&s;e Tor|toi&s;es is at the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and &s;everal little I&s;lands within the Gulf of <HI>Hondures:</HI> So that hone&s;t <HI>Pirard</HI> was ill-inform'd, who in his Treati&s;e of the Animals and Fruits of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> Chap. 2. affirmes, that this kinde of Tor|toi&s;e is to be found only in the <HI>Maldivos</HI> and the <HI>Philippine-I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>It is affirmed by &s;ome, that the oyl of this kind of Tortoi&s;e helpeth all kinds of Gouts proceeding from cold cau&s;es: It is al&s;o very &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed to &s;trengthen the Sinews, to take away the pain of the Reins, and cure all cold Fluxions and Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Having given &s;o particular an account of the Tortoi&s;es, it will not be ami&s;s to adde thereto the manner how they are fi&s;h'd for, and how all the great fi&s;hes of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> are taken.</P>

<HEAD>How the <HI>Tortoi&s;es</HI> and other great Fi&s;hes are taken in the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Sea-Tortoi&s;es are not only taken upon the &s;and, as we &s;hew'd before, but al&s;o by means of an In&s;trument, which is a pole about the length of a half-pike, at the end whereof there is fa&s;ten'd a nail pointed at both ends, which is &s;quare in the mid&s;t, and about the bigne&s;s of a mans little fin|ger: Some make notches on that &s;ide of it which &s;tands out of the wood, that it may take fa&s;ter hold when it is entred into the &s;hell of the Tortoi&s;e.</P>
<P>In the night time, the Moon &s;hining and the Sea calm, the Ma&s;ter-fi&s;her being in a little boat with two others, one at the oar to turn it of any &s;ide as fa&s;t as ever he can, that the boat may go much fa&s;ter and with le&s;s noi&s;e then if it were row'd; the other is in the mid&s;t of the Canow or Boat, holding the line which is fa&s;ten'd to the nail, and in a readine&s;s to draw it it as &s;oon as the in&s;trument hath done execution on the Tortoi&s;e.</P>
<P>Being thus provided, they go where they think to find of them; and when the Ma&s;ter-fi&s;her, who &s;tands up on the fore|part of the Canow, perceives one of them by the glittering of the Sea, which by getting up ever and anon to the face of the water it cau&s;eth to foam, he directs him who guides the little ve&s;&s;el to make to the place where he would have him, and be|ing gently got neer the Tortoi&s;e, he violently darts the in&s;tru|ment into its back: The nail piercing the &s;hell, gets al&s;o a good way into the fle&s;h, and the wood keeps up above the wa|ter: As &s;oon as the fi&s;h finds it &s;elf hurt, it &s;inks down to the bot|tom with the nail &s;ticking fa&s;t in the &s;hell: And the more it &s;trives and &s;truggles, the more it is entangled. At la&s;t having wearied it &s;elf, and &s;pent its forces in &s;triving by rea&s;on of its lo&s;s of blood, it &s;uffers it &s;elf to be ea&s;ily taken, and is either taken into the Canow, or drawn to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>After the &s;ame manner they al&s;o take <HI>Lamantins,</HI> and &s;everal other great fi&s;hes; but in&s;tead of the nail there is put into the wooden in&s;trument a great hook, or a &s;mall dart of iron made like that of a &s;harp lance: On one &s;ide of that piece of iron there is a hole, through which there pa&s;&s;eth a line, which is al|&s;o woond about the dart, &s;o that when it is darted into the fi&s;h, the line ea&s;ily is let loo&s;e, that it may have the liberty to tum|ble up and down in the water, and when it hath &s;pent its forces, and reduc'd to extremity, if it cannot be gotten into the Ca|now, it is ea&s;ily drawn to the &s;hore, where they divide it into quarters.</P>

But what is yet more &s;trange, is, that the creature never finds this moving lodging too narrow for him; for it grows larger proportionably as the body of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or grows bigger: The upper covering is in &s;ome of them about a foot and a half in length: it is of an oval figure, &s;omewhat hol|low like a Buckler, and on the out&s;ide hath &s;everal &s;treaks, which as it were divide it into &s;o many compartiments, with a certain ob&s;ervance of Symmetry: All the&s;e intermixtures are laid on a black ground, which in &s;everal places is enamell'd with white and yellow.</P>
<P>This kind of Tortoi&s;e hath a very ugly head, like that of a Serpent: It hath no teeth, but only jaws, which are &s;trong enough to break what it would &s;wallow down: It is &s;upported by four feet, &s;omewhat weak to &s;u&s;tain the weight of its body; nor does it upon pur&s;uit tru&s;t much to them: For if he be not neer &s;ome river or pond into which he may ca&s;t him&s;elf, he places all refuge and &s;afety in the covering of his man&s;ion, un|der which like a Hedg-hog he immediately draws in his head, feet and tail, upon the fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion of any danger.</P>
<P>The Female lays egges about the bigne&s;s of tho&s;e of Pige|ons, but a little longer: Having cover'd them with &s;and, &s;he leaves them to be hatch'd by the Sun.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXII.</HI> Containing the particular De&s;criptions of &s;everal &s;orts of Crabs or Crab-fi&s;h, commonly found in the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are found in all the <HI>Caribby-I&s;lands</HI> certain Crabs or Crab-fi&s;h, which are a kind of amphibious <HI>Crevices,</HI> and very good meat, whereas tho&s;e of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> are unplea|&s;ant, in a&s;much as they &s;mell of the Juniper-root. According|ly the Indian Inhabitants very highly e&s;teem theirs, and make them their ordinary entertainment: They are all of an oval figure, having the tail turning in under the belly: Their bo|dies, which are cover'd all over with a &s;hell hard enough, is &s;up|ported by &s;everal feet which are all full of little prickles, which facilitate their climbing up to tho&s;e places whither they would get up: The two fore-feet are very big, and of tho&s;e one is &s;omewhat bigger then the other: The French call the&s;e two fore feet or claws, <HI>Mordants,</HI> &s;ignificantly enough, fora&s;much as with the&s;e they twitch and &s;ecure what&s;oever they have fa&s;tened on: The fore-part which is &s;omewhat broader, and &s;tands up higher then the other, hath &s;tanding a little out two eyes, which are &s;olid, tran&s;parent, and of &s;everal colours: Their mouths are armed with two little white teeth di&s;pos'd on each &s;ide like a pair of &s;harp pincers, wherewith they cut the leaves of Fruits, and the roots of Trees on which they feed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TOURLOUROU.</HEAD>
<P>THere are three kinds of them, differing in bigne&s;s and co|lour, of which the lea&s;t are tho&s;e commonly called <HI>Tourlourous:</HI> They have a red &s;hell marked with black-&s;pots; they are plea&s;ant enough to the ta&s;te, but in regard there is much picking work about them, and but little to be gotten from them, and that it is conceived they incline people to the bloody flux, they are u&s;ed only in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>WHITE-CRABS.</HEAD>
<P>THere are others all white, and have their abodes at the foot of Trees on the Sea-&s;ide, in certain holes which they make in the ground, into which they retreat, as the Co|nies do into their Clappers or Hutches: The&s;e are the bigge&s;t of all the kinds, nay there have been tho&s;e taken which have had in one of their claws as much meat as an egge might con|tain,
<PB N="140" REF="84">
and as delicate as that of the River-Crevices: They are &s;eldom &s;een in the day time; but in the night they come in multitudes out of their holes to feed under the Trees; and it is then that they are taken with the help of a Lanthorn or Torches: They delight very much to be under the Arched-Indian-Fig-tree, and other Trees which are on the Sea-&s;ide, and in the mo&s;t fenny places: If a man &s;hall &s;earch into the ground, or in the &s;and to get them out of their lurking places, he &s;hall always find half their bodies in water, as mo&s;t of the other amphibious creatures are.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PAINTED-CRABS.</HEAD>
<P>BUt tho&s;e of the third kind, which as to bulk is between the two others before mentioned, are the mo&s;t beautiful, the mo&s;t to be admired, and the mo&s;t e&s;teem'd of all: They are indeed much of the &s;ame figure with the precedent; but according to the &s;everal I&s;lands, and different &s;oils wherein they are bred, they are painted with &s;o many colours, and tho&s;e &s;o beautiful and lively, that there cannot be a greater di|verti&s;ement then to &s;ee the&s;e creatures at mid-day creeping un|der the Trees where they &s;eek for their &s;u&s;tenance: Of &s;ome of them the bodies are of a violet colour intermixt with white: others are of a bright yellow interlaced with &s;everal &s;mall greyi&s;h and purple lines, which begin at the mouth and are drawn down over the back: Nay there are &s;ome which upon a dark-colour'd ground are &s;treaked with red, yellow and green, which makes the riche&s;t mixture of colours that can be imagin'd; looking on them at a little di&s;tance a man would think, that all tho&s;e delightful colours wherewith they are na|turally enamell'd, were not yet fully dry, &s;uch is their bright|ne&s;s, or that they were newly varni&s;h'd over to give them the greater lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Painted Crabs</HI> are not like the white ones, which dare not appear in the day time; for the&s;e are to be &s;een morning and evening, and after the rains under the Trees, where they recreate them&s;elves in great companies together: They will al&s;o &s;uffer a man to come neer enough to them; but as &s;oon as they perceive him make any attempt to take them (which is be&s;t done with a little wand, it being too dangerous to employ the hands) they make their retreat without turning their backs on tho&s;e that pur&s;ue them, and as they go back they &s;hew their teeth, and opening their defen&s;ives, which are tho&s;e two Claws or Mordants they have in their feet, they therewith de|fend their whole body, and they ever and anon &s;trike them one again&s;t another to frighten their enemies: And in that po&s;ture they get into their forts, which are commonly under the root, or in the cleft of &s;ome rotten Tree, or that of &s;ome rock.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="84">The&s;e Crabs have this natural in&s;tinct, to go every year about <HI>May,</HI> in the &s;ea&s;on of the rains, to the Sea-&s;ide to wa&s;h them&s;elves, and di&s;burthen them&s;elves of their egges, in order to the perpetuation of their &s;pecies: They come down from the Mountains in &s;uch multitudes, that the high-ways and woods are covered with them; and they have this &s;trange direction given them, that they take their way towards that part of the I&s;land where there are Creeks and de&s;cents, whereby they may the more ea&s;ily come to the Sea.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are at that time very much annoy'd by them, in regard they fill their Gardens, and with their little Mordants they cut the Pea&s;e and young Plants of Tobacco: They ob&s;erve &s;uch an order in this de&s;cent, that they look like an Army marching in rank and file: they never break their ranks, and whatever they meet with by the way, Hou&s;es, Mountains, Rocks, or other ob&s;tacles, they attempt to get over them, that they may go on &s;till in a &s;trait line: Twice a day they make a halt, during the greate&s;t heat, both to feed and re&s;t them&s;leves a while: But they make greater journies in the night then in the day, till at la&s;t they get to the Sea-&s;ide.</P>
<P>When they are upon this expedition they are fat, and good to eat; the Males being full of meat, and the Females of egges: And indeed during that time, a man may have of them at his door: Nay &s;ometimes they come into the hou&s;es if the palizadoes be not clo&s;e enough, and that they meet with a place to get in at: The noi&s;e they make in the night time is greater then that of the Mice, and keeps people from &s;leeping: When they are come to the Sea-&s;ide, having re&s;ted them&s;elves a little, and con&s;ider'd the Sea as the nur&s;e of their young ones, they approach &s;o neer it, that they wa&s;h them&s;elves three or four times in the little waves which gently ri&s;e and fall on the &s;and: then having retired into the Woods or neighbouring Plains to recover their wearine&s;s, the Females return a &s;econd time to the Sea, and having wa&s;h'd them&s;elves a little, they open their tails, which are commonly thru&s;t up under the belly, and &s;hake out the egges fa&s;ten'd thereto into the water: After which having once more wa&s;h'd them&s;elves, they return in the &s;ame order in which they came thither.</P>
<P>The &s;tronge&s;t of them &s;oon recover the Mountains, every one making to the quarter from whence he came, and by the &s;ame way through which he had pa&s;s'd before: But then, that is, in their return, they are for the mo&s;t part &s;o weak and lean, that they are forc'd to make &s;ome &s;tay in the next fields they come at to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and retrive their former vigour before they can get up to the tops of Mountains.</P>
<P>As to the Egges thus committed to the Sea, having been ca&s;t up by it on the &s;ofter kind of &s;and, and warm'd &s;ome time by the beams of the Sun, they are at la&s;t hatch'd, and become lit|tle

Crabs, whereof there may be &s;een millions about the bigne&s;s of a large farthing, getting into the neighbouring bu&s;hes till &s;uch time as they are &s;trong enough to get to the old ones in the Mountains.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable thing in the&s;e Crabs, is, that once a year, to wit, after their return from the Sea, they are under ground for the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, &s;o that there is not one of them to be &s;een: During this time they change their &s;kin or &s;hell, and become wholly new: They work out the earth &s;o neatly at the entrance of their retreats, that there is no hole to be &s;een; which they do to prevent their taking of any air; for when they put off their old coat, their whole body is as it were naked, being only cover'd with a very thin pellicle, which grows thicker and harder by degrees, till it come to the &s;olidity of the &s;hell they had put off.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Montel</HI> relates, that he purpo&s;ely cau&s;ed &s;ome places to be digg'd where it was likely there were of them hid|den: Having met with them, he found them wrapp'd in leaves of Trees, which no doubt was their &s;u&s;tenance, and &s;erv'd them for a ne&s;t during that retirement; but they were &s;o weak and unable to endure the air, that they &s;eemed as it were half dead, though fat enough, and excellent meat, and as &s;uch high|ly e&s;teemed by the Inhabitants: Clo&s;e by them he found the &s;hell they had put off, which &s;eem'd to be as entire as if the animal had been &s;till within it: And what was &s;trange, though he look'd very narrowly, yet hardly could he find any hole, or cleft at which the body of it might get out of that pri&s;on: But having view'd it very exactly, he found a little disjunction neer the tail, at which the Crab had &s;lipped out.</P>
<P>They are commonly dre&s;s'd as the Crevices in the&s;e parts are; but the more delicate will take the time and pains, after they are boiled, to pick out all that is good in the claws, and to extract a certain oily &s;ub&s;tance which is in the body, and by &s;ome called <HI>Taumaly,</HI> and to fry all together with the egges of the female, putting thereto a little of the Country Pepper, and &s;ome juice of Oranges; and this makes it one of the mo&s;t dainty di&s;hes in the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e grounds where there are many of the Trees called <HI>Manchenillos,</HI> the Crabs which feed under them, or eat of the fruit, have a venemous quality, in&s;omuch that tho&s;e who eat thereof fall dangerou&s;ly &s;ick: But in other parts they are whol|&s;om enough, and as the Crevices in <HI>Europe</HI> are numbred among the delicacies: Such as are careful of their health open them them before they eat thereof, and if they be black within they think them dangerous, and u&s;e them not.</P>

<HEAD>HURRICANE.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is mo&s;t to be feared is a general con&s;piracy of all the Winds, which goes about the Compa&s;s in the &s;pace of 24 hours, and &s;ometimes in le&s;s. This is that which is called a <HI>Hurricane,</HI> and happens commonly in the moneths of <HI>July, Augu&s;t,</HI> or <HI>September:</HI> at other times there is no fear of it. Heretofore it happened but once in &s;even years, and &s;ometimes &s;eldomer; but within the&s;e few years it hath happened once every two years, nay in one year there happened two of them: Nay not long after Mon&s;ieur <HI>Auber</HI> was &s;ent to command in chief at <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> there were three Hurricanes in one year.</P>
<P>This kind of Tempe&s;t is &s;o violent, that it breaks and unroots Trees, deprives tho&s;e it takes not away of all verdure, makes de&s;olate whole Fore&s;ts, removes Rooks from the tops of Moun|tains,

and ca&s;ts them into the Valleys, overthrows Hou&s;es, carries away the Plants it hath forc'd out of the Earth into the Sea, makes a general wa&s;te of all it meets with in the Fields; and in a word, leaves famine all over the Country, which groans a long time after that di&s;a&s;ter, and will be a long time ere it recovers the ruines occa&s;ion'd thereby.</P>
<P>Nor does the Hurricane all this mi&s;chief only by Land, but it rai&s;es withall &s;uch a tempe&s;t on the Sea, that it &s;eems to be mixt and confounded with the Air and the Sky: It breaks to pieces the Ships that happen to be on the Coa&s;ts at that time, ca&s;ting &s;ome upon the &s;hores, and &s;wallowing others into the Aby&s;&s;es of the Deep: So that tho&s;e which e&s;cape &s;hipwrack at &s;uch a time, are extreamly oblig'd to acknowledg the great mercy of God towards them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who ob&s;erve the &s;igns preceding this Tempe&s;t, have particularly noted the&s;e; That a little before it happens the Sea becomes of a &s;udden &s;o calm and even, that there appears not the lea&s;t wrinkle on her face; That the Birds by a natural in&s;tinct come down in multitudes from the Mountains, where they make their ordinary abode, to retire into the Plains and Valleys, where they keep on the ground to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the injuries of the cruel weather which they fore&s;ee coming; And that the Rain which falls a little before is bitter and &s;alt, as the Sea-water.</P>
<P>It is not many years &s;ince that there happen'd a memorable example of this Tempe&s;t upon &s;everal Ships lying in the Road of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> loaden with Tobacco, and ready to &s;et &s;ail; For they were all broken to pieces and ca&s;t away, and the Commodities wholly lo&s;t: Whereof there follow'd another &s;trange and unexpected accident, which was, that mo&s;t of the fi&s;h upon the Coa&s;t was poy&s;oned by the Tobacco: The Sea &s;eem'd in a manner cover'd with tho&s;e poor creatures, which turn'd up&s;ide-down and langui&s;hing floated on the face of the water, and came to dye on the &s;hore.</P>

<P><Q>We have been in a very &s;ad condition the&s;e two days, by rea&s;on of the extraordinary Tempe&s;t which began Saturday night la&s;t, the 28th of this month, and continues yet: We &s;ee from our Walls between thirty and forty Ships ca&s;t a way, and forc'd to the &s;hore, mo&s;t Engli&s;h bottoms, and abundance of Merchandize lo&s;t: One of the&s;e Ships of 200 Tun burthen was ca&s;t neer a Wind-mill, which is twelve foot higher then any tide was ever &s;een; for the Tempe&s;t was not only in the Air, but it al&s;o forc'd the Sea much beyond its ordinary li|mits, in&s;omuch that the &s;poil it hath done by Land very much exceeds the lo&s;s of the Ships. All the Salt on the low Mar&s;hes was carried away; all the Wheat on the lower grounds and reduced marches overflown: And in the I&s;le of <HI>Ree</HI> the Sea cro&s;s'd it from one &s;ide to the other, &s;poil'd abundance of Vineyards, and drown'd much Cattel. In the memory of man the Sea never came up &s;o high; nay it came to &s;ome places almo&s;t a league within the Land: So that tho&s;e who have been at S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> affirm, that the Hur|ricanes happening there are not more dreadful then this Tempe&s;t was here: The wind was North-we&s;t: The lo&s;s both on Sea and Land is valued at five hundred thou&s;and Crowns: 'Tis conceiv'd there is as much Salt lo&s;t as would have freighted two hundred Ships of three hundred Tun a piece.

<HEAD>MOUSTICOES, and MARINGOINS.</HEAD>
<P>THere is then, in the fir&s;t place, a &s;ort of very &s;mall Flies, by &s;ome called <HI>Mou&s;ticoes,</HI> which are felt commonly be|fore they are &s;een: But in that little weak body there is &s;o &s;harp and venemous a &s;ting, as cau&s;ing an importunate itch that will not be &s;atisfi'd till the &s;kin be &s;cratch'd off, the wound degenerates into a dangerous Ulcer if &s;ome remedy be not apply'd.</P>
<P>There is another kind &s;omwhat bigger, and making a noi&s;e like that of the Flies, &s;een in the&s;e parts neer ponds and fenny places, by &s;ome of the Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> called <HI>Ma|ringoins:</HI> They do the &s;ame effect with the former, being arm'd with a little &s;ting which pierces through cloaths, nay through the Hammocks, or hanging-beds on which people re&s;t them&s;elves: But both kinds have this particular to them, that they never do any mi&s;chief, but they before-hand proclaim a war, and &s;ound a charge with their little Trumpet, which ma|ny times does more frighten then their &s;tinging hurts.</P>
<P>To avoid the annoyance of the&s;e two little In&s;ects, the In|habitants place their hou&s;es on a little eminency, give them air on all &s;ides, and cut down all the Trees which may hinder the Ea&s;t-wind, which is the ordinary wind blowing in tho&s;e I&s;lands, and which drives away the&s;e wicked and importunate enemies:

<HEAD>MANCHENILLO.</HEAD>
<P>IN mo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands there grow certain Trees called by &s;ome <HI>Manchenillo-trees,</HI> beautiful to the eye, bearing leaves like tho&s;e of Crab-trees, and a fruit called <HI>Manchenillo,</HI> like an <HI>Appius-apple;</HI> for it is &s;treaked with red, extreamly fair, and of a plea&s;ant &s;cent, in&s;omuch that one can hardly forbear ta&s;ting it if he be not before-hand acquainted with its dangerous quali|ty; for though it be &s;weet in the mouth, yet is it &s;o fatal that being eaten it &s;ends a man to &s;leep, not for 24 hours, (as a cer|tain &s;eed of <HI>Peru,</HI> and an herb in the Ea&s;t, whereof <HI>Lin&s;cot</HI> &s;peaks at large) but &s;o as never to awake again; &s;o that it is much wor&s;e then tho&s;e Almonds of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which &s;mell like mu&s;k, but being eaten leave a ta&s;te of rottenne&s;s behind them; as al&s;o then the fair Apples of <HI>Sodom,</HI> which being opened yield only &s;oot and a&s;hes; for if a man have the mi&s;chance to be de|ceiv'd in them, it is without any hazard of his life: But the&s;e venemous Apples may be compared to the <HI>Indian-nut</HI> which grows in <HI>Java:</HI> It is &s;omwhat like a Gall, and at the fir&s;t eating thereof it ta&s;tes like a &s;mall Nut; but afterwards it cau&s;eth mortal gripings, and is a mo&s;t dangerous poy&s;on: There is al&s;o in <HI>Africk</HI> a Tree called <HI>Co&s;coma,</HI> which bears deadly Apples: The Tree of the <HI>Maldivas,</HI> named <HI>Ambou,</HI> bears a fruit no le&s;s deceitful and pernicious: And neer <HI>Tripoly</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> there are
<PB N="148" REF="88">
certain large Apricocks, which are fair to the eye, and very &s;avoury to the palat; but the &s;ub&s;equent qualities of them are many times mortal, or at be&s;t, cau&s;e long and painful di&s;ea&s;es to &s;uch as have eaten of them.</P>
<P>There grow <HI>Manchenillo</HI>-Trees on the Sea-&s;ide and the banks of Rivers, and if the fruit fall into the water, the fi&s;h eating thereof will certainly dye; nay though it conti|nue long in the water, yet will it not rot, but is cover'd with &s;alt-peter, which gives it a &s;olid cru&s;tine&s;s, as if it were petrify'd. In tho&s;e I&s;lands where this Tree grows in abun|dance the Snakes are venemous, it being &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that they &s;ometimes &s;uck the fruit of it: Nay the Crabs which feed under the&s;e Trees contract a dangerous quality from them, as we &s;aid el&s;ewhere; and many have been &s;ick after the eating thereof: Whence it comes, that when the&s;e fruits fall to the ground, &s;uch as are careful of their health will for|bear the eating of Crabs.</P>
<P>Yet do not the Snakes or Crabs wholly live on this fruit, but feeding under the Tree they draw the infection thereof to them&s;elves, e&s;pecially if they &s;uck the venome of its fruit. It may well be, that what is mortal to &s;ome creatures is not &s;o to all; and that the&s;e In&s;ects often feeding on this poy&s;on, do by cu&s;tom and continuance turn it into their &s;u&s;tenance, as is re|ported of <HI>Mithridates:</HI> And &s;o they may infect &s;uch as eat thereof, receiving them&s;elves no hurt thereby.</P>
<P>Under the bark of the trunk and boughs of the&s;e Trees there is contained a certain glutinous water, which is white as milk, extremely malignant and dangerous: There being ma|ny of them along the high-ways, if one &s;hould carele&s;ly break one of their branches, that milk or rather poy&s;on comes forth, and falls upon him: If it light on his &s;hirt, it makes an ugly &s;tain as if it were burnt; if on the &s;kin, and the place be not immediately wa&s;h'd, it will be all bli&s;tered: but if it &s;hould chance that a drop of this cau&s;tick and venemous water &s;hould fall into the eye, it will cau&s;e an in&s;upportable inflammation, and the party &s;hall lo&s;e his &s;ight for nine days, after which he will have &s;ome ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The dew, or rain-water, having continu'd a while on the leaves of the&s;e Trees, produces the &s;ame effect, and if it &s;hould light on the &s;kin, it would &s;corch it like Aqua-fortis: So that it is almo&s;t as bad as the drops of rain falling under the Line, which are &s;o contagious, as tho&s;e who have felt them affirm, that if they fall on the hands, face, or any uncover'd part of the body, there immediately ri&s;e up bladders and bli&s;ters with much pain; and if the party do not pre&s;ently &s;hift his cloths, his body will be full of wheals all over; not to mention the worms which are bred in the cloths.</P>
<P>Nay the very &s;hade of the&s;e Trees is prejudicial to men,
<PB N="149" REF="88" MS="y">
and if a man re&s;t him&s;elf under them, the whole body &s;wells after a &s;trange manner. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> mention a Tree of <HI>Arcadia</HI> no le&s;s dangerous; and tho&s;e who have travell'd into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> affirm, that there is an herb named <HI>Sapony,</HI> which cau&s;es their death who lye upon it. But what heightens the ill quality of the <HI>Manchenillo</HI>-Tree, is, that the meat dre&s;s'd with a fire made of its wood derives a certain malignity from it, which burns the mouth and throat.</P>
<P>Nor are the Savages of the&s;e I&s;lands ignorant of the nature of the <HI>Manchenillo;</HI> for the compo&s;ition wherewith they are wont to poy&s;on their arrows hath in it, among other ingredi|ents, the milk of this Tree, and the dew falling from it, and the juice of the fruit.</P>
<P>To cure, in a &s;hort time, the &s;welling and bli&s;ters ri&s;ing on the body after &s;leeping under the &s;hade of the&s;e Trees, or receiving the rain or dew falling from their branches, as al|&s;o tho&s;e occa&s;ion'd by the milk within the bark, recour&s;e mu&s;t be immediately made to a kind of Snails, whereof we have &s;poken before, under the name of <HI>Souldiers,</HI> and let the party take a certain cleer water which is contain'd with|in their &s;hell, and apply it to the place affected: this remedy immediately allays the venome of that &s;corching liquour, and puts the party out of all danger: The oyl extracted without fire from the &s;ame Snail operates the &s;ame effect. But if any &s;hall happen to eat of the fruit of the&s;e venemous Trees, he mu&s;t u&s;e the remedies pre&s;cribed hereafter, to ex|pell the venome of Serpents, and all other poy&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>WOOD-LICE.</HEAD>
<P>THere is al&s;o a kind of Ant, or worm, which hath a lit|tle black &s;pot on the head, all the re&s;t of the body being white: They are bred of rotten wood, and thence &s;ome call them <HI>Wood-lice:</HI> Their bodies are &s;ofter then tho&s;e of our ordinary Ants, and yet their tooth is &s;o &s;harp, that they gnaw wood, and get into &s;uch coffers as lye neer the ground: And in le&s;s then two days, if they be not de&s;troy'd, there will get in &s;uch abundance, that linen, cloaths, paper, and what|ever is within them will be eaten and devoured; nay they gnaw and eat the po&s;ts which &s;u&s;tain the ordinary hutts, in&s;o|much that if &s;ome cour&s;e be not taken they will at la&s;t fall down.</P>
<P>To prevent the breeding of the&s;e In&s;ects, and the mi&s;chief done by them, there are the&s;e cautions: At the building of hou&s;es not to leave any wood on the ground to rot, out of which they may breed: To burn the ends of tho&s;e pieces of wood that are planted in the ground: As &s;oon as any of them are perceiv'd, to ca&s;t &s;calding water into the holes which they
<PB N="150" REF="89">
have made: To hang up Che&s;ts and Coffers in the air with cords, as they are forc'd to do in &s;everal parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies,</HI> that they may not touch the ground: And la&s;tly, to keep the rooms very clean, and leave nothing on the ground. It hath al&s;o been ob&s;erv'd, that the rubbing of their haunts with the oyl of that kind of <HI>Palma-Chri&s;ti</HI> wherewith the Negroes rub their heads to avoid vermine, hath prevented their com|ing any more that way. The oyl of <HI>Lamantin</HI> hath the &s;ame effect, and if it be poured on their rendezvouz, which is a kind of Ant-hill made up of their own ordure, and fa&s;ten'd a|bout the forks which &s;u&s;tain the hutts, they immediately for|&s;ake it.</P>

<HEAD>RAVETS.</HEAD>
<P>ANother dangerous vermine are the <HI>Ravets,</HI> of which there are two kinds: The bigger are almo&s;t like Locu&s;ts, and of the &s;ame colour; the others are not half as big: Both kinds have their walks in the night-time, get into Che&s;ts if they be not very clo&s;e, foul all things wherever they come, and do mi&s;chief enough, yet not &s;o much, nor in &s;o &s;hort a time, as the Wood-lice. They are called <HI>Ravets,</HI> becau&s;e like Rats they gnaw whatever they come at: They are no doubt the &s;ame which <HI>de Lery</HI> calls <HI>Aravers,</HI> according to the Language of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians.</HI> This vermine hath a particular malice to Books, and their covers. The Wood-lice are as good, if they can get at them; but they are to be commend|ed in this particular, that they have a re&s;pect for the letters, and only nibble about the margents; for whether they can|not away with the ink, or for &s;ome other rea&s;on, it mu&s;t be an extraordinary famine that &s;hall force them to feed on the impre&s;&s;ion, or writing&punc; But they are very great lovers of linen above any thing, and if they can get into a Che&s;t, they will de&s;ire but one night to make work enough for many Semp&s;tre&s;&s;es for a month.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ravets,</HI> though they be not &s;o quick at their work, yet they &s;pare nothing but &s;ilk and cotton-&s;tuffs; nay they have no &s;tomach to &s;ilk or cotton even while it is raw; in&s;omuch that if the Che&s;ts be hung up in the air, and the cords be done about with cotton, as &s;oon as they find their little feet fa&s;ten'd in it, they immediately endeavour to get away, and turn &s;omewhere el&s;e. Such as dwell in hou&s;es of brick or &s;tone are not troubled with the Wood-lice, but with all their care they have much ado to avoid the mi&s;chief done by the <HI>Ravets:</HI> Yet hath it been found by experience, that they cannot endure &s;weet &s;cents, and that they would not willingly get into Che&s;ts made of Cedar, and tho&s;e excellent &s;weet woods which are common in all the&s;e I&s;lands. At <HI>Cairo</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="89" MS="y">

<HEAD>CHEGOES.</HEAD>
<P>BUt what is mo&s;t to be feared in all the&s;e I&s;lands is a certain kind of little worm, no bigger then a hand-worm, which breeds in the du&s;t, in the &s;weepings ca&s;t out into the dung|hill, and &s;uch unclean places: The&s;e are commonly called <HI>Chegoes.</HI> They get into peoples feet, and under the nails of their toes; but if they get any further, and are not taken a|way in time, they will get into all the other parts of the bo|dy. At fir&s;t they only cau&s;e a little itching, but having once got through the &s;kin, they cau&s;e an inflammation in the place affected, and though very little when they entred it, come in time to be as big as a pea, and produce abundance of nits, which may breed others; and &s;o many times ulcers are bred in the places whence they are taken.</P>
<P>The Savages, as they relate who have liv'd among them, have a certain gum, wherewith having rubb'd their feet, e&s;pe|cially under the nails, they are not annoy'd with this vermine: But &s;uch as know not that &s;ecret are advis'd to have their feet &s;earch'd by tho&s;e who have the &s;kill to di&s;cover and take out tho&s;e dangerous In&s;ects, as &s;oon as they feel the lea&s;t itch|ing; at which work the Indians are very expert and fortu|nate. Tho&s;e who take out the&s;e <HI>Chegoes</HI> mu&s;t have a care that they break not the bag wherein they are enclo&s;ed; which if they do, &s;ome of their little egges will remain be|hind, which will infallibly breed others. It is conceived al|&s;o, that the <HI>Roucou,</HI> which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> u&s;e to make them|&s;elves more beautiful, more nimble, and more active to run, hath a &s;ecret vertue to keep off all the&s;e vermine.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a good remedy often to &s;prinkle &s;alt-water a|bout the room; not to go bare-foot; to wear &s;tockings of Goats-leather; and to keep ones &s;elf very clean: For com|monly only &s;uch as are carele&s;s of them&s;elves, and &s;lovenly, are much troubled with them. The&s;e little worms are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> call <HI>Tons,</HI> and &s;ome other Indians <HI>Nigas.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have Ulcers cau&s;ed by the&s;e little worms, either for want of taking them out &s;kilfully or in time, are among the French called <HI>Malingres.</HI> The&s;e Ulcers come al&s;o many times after &s;ome little &s;cratching, which at fir&s;t &s;eems to be little or nothing: But afterwards, the party may well wonder to &s;ee it as big as the palm of a mans hand; for the Ulcer mu&s;t
<PB N="152" REF="90">
have its cour&s;e: Nay &s;ome of them, though little, yet are ve|ry hard to be cured. Of the&s;e Ulcers there are two kinds; one round, the other uneven: The round Ulcer is harder to cure then the other, for it is encompa&s;s'd with dead fle&s;h, which makes it the wor&s;e; for till that dead and loo&s;e fle&s;h be remo|ved, the Ulcer cannot be cured: Therefore as often as the wound is dre&s;s'd, that dead fle&s;h mu&s;t be quite cut away, which cau&s;es extraordinary pains.</P>
<P>Among the remedies for the healing of the&s;e Ulcers, there are u&s;ed Verdi-greece, Aqua-fortis, the &s;pirit of Vitriol, and burnt Allom, which eat away the dead fle&s;h: They u&s;e to the &s;ame end the juice of the le&s;&s;er Citron, which is extreamly &s;harp; and when the wound is foul, it makes it clean, and look well: True it is, the pain which the party feels when the wound is rubbed therewith is &s;o great, that he would rather pitch on any of the other remedies; but they do not heal &s;o &s;oon: There is al&s;o an Unguent made of common honey, a little &s;harp Vinegar, and the powder of Verdi-greece, which cures Ulcers in a &s;hort time: And to prevent them, let not any one make &s;light of the lea&s;t hurt or &s;cratch that happens in any part of the body what&s;oever, e&s;pecially the feet or legs, but to apply a plai&s;ter thereto, to take away the heat which may be in the wound; and in ca&s;e there be no other remedy procurable, to put &s;ome Tobacco-leaves to it, and to u&s;e the juice of Citron and Vinegar, to take away the itch which remains after the &s;tinging of the <HI>Mou&s;ticoes</HI> and the <HI>Maringoins,</HI> rather then to make u&s;e of the nails.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth Chapter of this Hi&s;tory, we &s;aid there were Ser|pents and Snakes in the I&s;lands of <HI>Martinico</HI> and St. <HI>Alou&s;ia,</HI> which have a dangerous venom: We &s;hall here a&s;&s;ign the Re|medies which may be &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed in order to the taking away thereof.

<HEAD>RATS.</HEAD>
<P>MIce and Rats were creatures heretofore unknown to the <HI>Caribbians;</HI> but now &s;ince the coming in of &s;o many Ships to tho&s;e I&s;lands, and the ca&s;ting away of divers of them in the very Roads, where they afterwards rot, they have got to land, and are &s;o multiply'd, that in &s;ome places they do abun|dance of mi&s;chief among the Potatoes, Pea&s;e, Beans, and par|ticularly that kind of Wheat which is called Turkey-wheat: Nay did not the Snakes de&s;troy them, and &s;earch for them in their holes under ground, in the clefts of rocks, nay even in the coverings of hou&s;es, which con&s;i&s;t of Palm-leaves, or Su|gar-canes, it would no doubt be a very hard matter to &s;ecure Provi&s;ions from them. Now indeed there are Cats in the&s;e I&s;lands, which give them no quarter; nay, Dogs are taught to hunt them, and it is no &s;mall diver&s;ion to &s;ee how &s;ubtle they are to find them out, and expert in the hunting and killing of them.</P>
<P>Nor is this inconvenience particular to the <HI>Caribbies;</HI> nay it is much wor&s;e in <HI>Peru;</HI> for <HI>Garcila&s;&s;o,</HI> in his <HI>Royal Commen|tary,</HI>

<P>The Inhabitants of the I&s;lands have an invention which they call <HI>Balan,</HI> to keep the Rats from eating their <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> and other Provi&s;ions. This <HI>Balan</HI> is a kind of round hurdle, or haply &s;quare, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;takes, on which they place the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> after it hath been dried in the Sun: It is fa&s;ten'd at the top of the Hut, hanging down by a Witth or Cord; and that the Rats may not come down along the Cord, and &s;o get to the <HI>Balan,</HI> they put the Cord through a &s;mooth gourd which hangs loo&s;e in the mid&s;t of it, &s;o that the Rats being come to that place, being not able to fa&s;ten their feet in it, and fearing the motion of the Gourd, are afraid to venture any further: Were it not for this &s;ecret, the Inhabitants would find it a hard ta&s;k to keep their provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus hath the wi&s;e Author of Nature been pleas'd, by an admirable equipollence of perfections and imperfections, that tho&s;e Countries which have &s;ome advantages above others &s;hould al&s;o be &s;ubject to tho&s;e inconveniences that are not to be found el&s;ewhere.

<P>_IN the precedent Di&s;cour&s;e we have given a full account of whatever might relate to the Natural Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands; our de&s;ign leads us now to that part of the Hi&s;tory which we call the MORAL, wherein we are to treat of the Inhabitants of the &s;aid I&s;lands, of whom we have oc|ca&s;ionally made mention in the De&s;cription we have given of tho&s;e places in the precedent Book. In the fir&s;t place we &s;hall &s;peak of tho&s;e Inhabitants thereof who are Strangers, or <HI>Euro|peans,</HI>

yet only &s;o far as the pro&s;ecution of our De&s;ign requires; which having di&s;patch'd, we &s;hall de&s;cend to a more large and particular con&s;ideration of the <HI>Indians,</HI> the natural and origi|nary Inhabitants of the Country; a ta&s;k which requires a more ample deduction, and a more exact and curious di&s;qui&s;ition, upon this pre&s;umption, that there hath yet been very little publi&s;h'd upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> grounding their Title upon the Donation of Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the &s;ixth, and &s;ome other apparent Rea|&s;ons and Pretences, pre&s;ume that the right of Navigation into the late di&s;cover'd part of the World, which is call'd <HI>America,</HI> and of e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;etling Colonies there, whether it be in the Continent, or in any of the I&s;lands, properly belongs to them, exclu&s;ively to all others. But not to urge that the vani|ty of that arrogant pre&s;umption is &s;ufficiently di&s;cover'd of it &s;elf, and that it would prove a great digre&s;&s;ion from the de&s;ign of our Hi&s;tory to engage our &s;elves in a particular di&s;qui&s;ition of that Controver&s;ie, we need only &s;ay, that <HI>Bergeron,</HI> a learn|ed and curious Authour, hath &s;o exactly handled this Que&s;tion, and &s;o cleerly &s;hewn the ab&s;urdity of that chimerical pretence, in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Navigations,</HI> that it would be lo&s;t labour for us to in&s;i&s;t upon it, or to think of any thing new that can be produc'd upon that account. Accordingly all Chri&s;tian Kings and Princes have always di&s;puted thar pretended Right with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as unanimou&s;ly concluding that he had un|ju&s;tly attributed the &s;ame to him&s;elf: Nor have they engag'd again&s;t him only by words and writings, but have effectually pro&s;ecuted their own preten&s;ions, and from time to time &s;ent Fleets into <HI>America</HI> to &s;etle Plantations there, and to take into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal parts of that new World; wherein the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful have been the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>But it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that of all the Colonies which the&s;e three European Nations have planted in <HI>America,</HI> tho&s;e that &s;etled them&s;elves in the <HI>Caribby-I&s;lands</HI> are of greate&s;t account, and the mo&s;t frequented by Merchants, as being the mo&s;t ad|vantageous upon the &s;core of Trade. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> as may have been noted in the fir&s;t Book of this Hi&s;tory, are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in tho&s;e parts, and have divided between them the greate&s;t, the riche&s;t, and the mo&s;t populous of all tho&s;e I&s;lands.</P>
<P>We may further affirm it as a thing generally known, that the&s;e Nations have not in their &s;everal e&s;tabli&s;hments follow'd the inhumane and barbarous maximes of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor after their example unmercifully exterminated the originary Inhabitants of the Country; for if they found any of them in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands where they liv'd, they have for the mo&s;t part pre&s;erv'd them therein, and contracted alliances
<PB N="159" REF="93">
with them. Yet mu&s;t it be acknowledg'd that the the <HI>Carib|bians</HI> have had very great differences with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that the &s;aid differences have continu'd a long time; but the ground of their quarrels proceeded from &s;ome occa&s;ions of di&s;content which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> receiv'd from &s;ome particular per&s;ons of that Nation, which repre&s;ented in a Body hath di&s;|approv'd their procedure, and upon all emergencies hath ex|pre&s;s'd it &s;elf &s;o far di&s;&s;atisfi'd therewith, as to de&s;ire that they &s;hould be treated with the &s;ame humanity, moderation, and Chri&s;tian mildne&s;s, as tho&s;e greater and flouri&s;hing Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> that are under the juri&s;diction of the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> have hitherto us'd towards the natural Inhabi|tants of that part of <HI>America</HI> which lies more Northerly, where they have e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves; for it is known that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> hold &s;o &s;acred and perfect a corre&s;pondence with them, as hath opened a way for their in&s;truction in the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tian Religion, and the planting of a great number of fair Churches among&s;t tho&s;e poor Barbarians.</P>
<P>But above all, this is mo&s;t certain, that when the <HI>French</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves in the I&s;lands&punc; of <HI>Martinico, Gardeloupe,</HI> and <HI>Granada,</HI> it was done with the consent of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable per&s;ons among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who thereupon di&s;|own'd tho&s;e of their Country-men who would have ob&s;tructed the &s;aid e&s;tabli&s;hment: Nay &s;uch was their earne&s;tne&s;s therein, that they employ'd all their Forces and Councils to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of the others, and to &s;ecure the <HI>French</HI> in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they had before granted them. This pro|ceeding ab&s;olutely clears the <HI>French</HI> of being guilty of the &s;ame violences which are charg'd upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and makes it appear, that the &s;etlement of the former in tho&s;e I&s;lands was not like that of the latter in tho&s;e places where they have the opportunities to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves. And if it be objected to the <HI>French,</HI> that they have forc'd the natural In|habitants out of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> and <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> and that even at this pre&s;ent there is a War between the &s;aid Nation and tho&s;e of <HI>Martinico;</HI> it may be an&s;wer'd, that when the <HI>French</HI> peo|pled the&s;e I&s;lands, they propos'd to them&s;elves no other de&s;ign then the edification and in&s;truction of tho&s;e poor Barbarians, and that if contrary to their fir&s;t intention they had been forc'd to u&s;e a &s;evere hand towards &s;ome particular per&s;ons, and to treat them as enemies, they were them&s;elves the occa&s;ion of their own misfortune, by being the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ors, and guil|ty of previous violations of the &s;acred Laws of Alliance, which they had contracted with them, and engaging them&s;elves in &s;anguinary coun&s;els, &s;uch as would have &s;mother'd their Colo|nies ere they were fully &s;etled, had there not been a timely di&s;|covery made thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Colonies had their beginning at the
<PB N="160" REF="94">
&s;ame time, which was in the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred twenty and five: Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;nambuc,</HI> a French Gentleman, of the ancient Hou&s;e of <HI>Vauderop,</HI> and a Captain under the King of <HI>France</HI> in the We&s;tern Seas, and Sir <HI>Thomas Warner,</HI> an Engli&s;h Gentleman, joyntly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> on the &s;ame day, in the names of the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and Great <HI>Britain,</HI> their Ma&s;ters, that they might have a place of &s;afe retreat, and a good Haven for the recepti|on of &s;uch Ships of both Nations as &s;hould be bound for <HI>Ame|rica;</HI> that I&s;land being furni&s;h'd with all the advantages whereof we have given a full account in the Chapter particu|larly de&s;ign'd by us for the de&s;cription of it; upon which &s;core it was visited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who often put in there for re|fre&s;hments, both as they were inward and outward bound in their long Voyages: Nay &s;ometimes they left their &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k there to be look'd to by the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> with whom they had made a peace upon tho&s;e terms.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Gentlemen therefore con&s;idering with them|&s;elves, that if they were po&s;&s;e&s;'d of that Country they might the better incommodate their common enemy in <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and have withall a convenient and &s;ecure habitation, in order to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Colonies they intended for tho&s;e I&s;lands, became Ma&s;ters of it, and left men therein to keep it: But before they parted thence, having &s;ome grounds to fear that there might be &s;ome &s;ecret intelligence between the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or that in their ab&s;ence they might execute the re&s;olution, which by the per&s;wa&s;ion of certain Sor|cerers (a &s;ort of people in great e&s;teem among the <HI>Indians</HI>) they had undertaken, which was to put to death all the Strang|ers who were come into their Country, they in one night rid their hands of all the mo&s;t factious of that Nation, and not long after forc'd all the re&s;t, who had got together into &s;eve|ral Bodies, and intended to &s;tand upon their guard, to retire to &s;ome other places, and to leave that to their di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>Things being thus order'd, <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> returns into <HI>France,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Warner</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> where their conque&s;t and all their proceedings thereupon were approved by the Kings their Ma&s;ters; and having obtained a permi&s;&s;ion to carry over &s;ome recruits of men, they came back to the I&s;land in the qua|lity of Governours and Lieutenants, under the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and Great <HI>Britany.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> before he went over to cultivate and pro&s;e|cute his conque&s;t imagin'd to him&s;elf, that the mo&s;t likely way to have a powerful &s;upport in <HI>France,</HI> &s;uch as &s;hould con|cern it &s;elf in the pre&s;ervation of that I&s;land, and &s;o to &s;ecure and promote his de&s;igns, would be to get together a Company of per&s;ons of Authority, which &s;hould have the direction and &s;igniory of the &s;aid I&s;land, and what others might afterwards

be conquer'd and reduc'd under the juri&s;diction of the King of <HI>France;</HI> upon this provi&s;ion, that the &s;aid Company &s;hould have a care, and make it their earne&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;upply the Co|lony with men for the keeping and cultivation of it; as al&s;o with Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks to be maintain'd by allowances from the &s;aid Company; and la&s;tly to build certain Forts there for the &s;ecurity of the Inhabitants, and to furni&s;h them with Canon, Powder, and all &s;orts of Ammunition; in a word, to main|tain a &s;ufficient Ar&s;enal, wherein &s;hould be all things in readi|ne&s;s to oppo&s;e the Enemy.</P>
<P>This Company, or Society, was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the moneth of <HI>October,</HI> in the year of our Lord, one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred twenty and &s;ix, as well for the Government of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> as tho&s;e other I&s;lands which are adjacent thereto, and was ap|prov'd by the King of <HI>France.</HI> Since that time it hath been further confirm'd, and favour'd with &s;ome new Conce&s;&s;ions, and very advantageous priviledges obtain'd from his mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty the eighth of <HI>March,</HI> one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred forty and two, for all the I&s;lands of <HI>America</HI> lying between the tenth and thirtieth degree on this &s;ide the Equator.</P>
<P><HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> having thus order'd his affairs in <HI>France,</HI> returns to S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> with a recruit of three hundred men, which the Gentlemen of the Company newly erected had rai&s;ed, in order to the advancement of that Colony: He brought over a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">o along with him a con&s;iderable number of gallant Volun|teers, who look'd on it as no &s;mall honour to run fortunes with &s;o famous an Adventurer, and to participate of his honourable hazards, out of a confidence in proce&s;s of time of reaping the fruit of his Conque&s;ts. They got all &s;afely to S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> about the beginning of the year, M. DC. XXVII. and though they had &s;uffered much during their Voyage, and were mo&s;t of them either sick or much weakned, yet were they not di&s;cou|rag'd by tho&s;e difficulties, but reflecting that the noble&s;t enter|pri&s;es are many times attended by great inconveniences, and that Ro&s;es cannot be gather'd without thorns, they immedi|ately fell to work, and having in a &s;hort time learn'd of tho&s;e whom they found in the I&s;le what they were to do in order to their further e&s;tabli&s;hment, they behav'd them&s;elves an&s;wera|bly to the generous de&s;igns of their Captain, who on his part more and more encourag'd them by words and example.</P>
<P>How the I&s;land was to be divided between the two Nations had been de&s;ign'd before that Voyage; but the particular Ar|ticles of the Divi&s;ion were &s;olemnly agreed to and concluded on the 13th of <HI>May,</HI> in the &s;aid year, M.

<P>Nay it was further agreed upon by certain Articles con|cluded on both &s;ides, that a good corre&s;pondence &s;hould be maintain'd between them, as al&s;o for the preventing of all jea|lou&s;ies, and avoiding the occa&s;ions of di&s;putes and conte&s;tati|ons, which might ea&s;ily ari&s;e between people of different hu|mours: They further made a Defen&s;ive League for the mu|tual relief of each other, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require, again&s;t the attempts of the common Enemy, or any other who &s;hould en|deavour to di&s;turb the peace and quiet which they hoped to en|joy together in tho&s;e parts of the Country where they had planted them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e things thus &s;etled, the two Governours betray'd a certain emulation in carrying on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their Co|lonies; in the pro&s;ecution whereof it is mo&s;t certain the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had very con&s;iderable advantages above the <HI>French</HI> to compa&s;s their de&s;igns: For be&s;ides that that Nation, which is as it were nurs'd up in the bo&s;om of the Sea, can better endure the hard|&s;hip and inconveniences of long Voyages, and is better vers'd in the making of new Plantations; the Company which was e&s;tabli&s;h'd at <HI>London</HI> for the management of that of S. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers,</HI> made &s;uch generous provi&s;ions, that at its fir&s;t &s;etlement it might be &s;upply'd with Men and Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and took &s;o particular a care of all things, that it was from time to time refre&s;h'd with new re|cruits, and whatever it might &s;tand in need of at the begin|ning, that it vi&s;ibly pro&s;per'd and advanc'd while the <HI>French,</HI> which was unfurni&s;h'd with all tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, &s;eem'd to pine and langui&s;h, nay indeed would have quite fallen away if the affection which it had for its chief Director, and the high e&s;teem it had conceiv'd of his valour had not kept it up.</P>
<P>While therefore the <HI>French</HI> Colony was reduc'd to the&s;e ex|tremities, and in a manner &s;ub&s;i&s;ted only by its courage, that of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being in a good plight and condition, &s;pred it &s;elf into a new one, which planted it &s;elf in the I&s;land of <HI>Me|vis,</HI> which is divided from S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> only by a &s;mall arm of the Sea, as we have &s;aid el&s;ewhere: But if the &s;mall number whereto the <HI>French</HI> were reduc'd permitted them not to make the like progre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es, their Governour <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> had in the mean time the opportunity to make &s;everal u&s;eful regulations
<PB N="163" REF="95">
for the better &s;etlement of it: Of the&s;e we &s;hall not think it be&s;ides our de&s;ign to in&s;ert here &s;ome few of the principal Arti|cles, to the end the memory of them may be preciou&s;ly pre|&s;erv'd for the in&s;truction of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, taking it into his con&s;ideration, that by peace and concord &s;mall things come to be great, and that di|vi&s;ion di&s;tracts and di&s;per&s;es the greate&s;t, he ordered that all the Inhabitants of the I&s;land who were &s;ubject to his juri&s;dicti|on &s;hould maintain a perfect union among them&s;elves, and that he pre&s;s'd and recommended to them upon all occa&s;ions as the Pillar of their little State, and the &s;acred Channel through which they were to expect the ble&s;&s;ings both of Heaven and Earth abundantly to flow upon them: And whereas it is impo&s;|&s;ible that in mutual conver&s;ation there &s;hould not happen many things which might oftentimes offer &s;ome violence to that ami|cable corre&s;pondence, if &s;ome pre&s;ent provi&s;ion be not made to the contrary, he de&s;ired that &s;uch differences might be with the &s;oone&s;t either decided or &s;mother'd, and all be recon|cil'd with meekne&s;s, and that if po&s;&s;ible before the &s;etting of the Sun.</P>
<P>Another command of his was, that his people &s;hould be faith|ful to their tru&s;t, and free, and &s;incere in all their affairs; ob|liging and charitable towards their Neighbours, and as religi|ous and punctual in the ob&s;ervance of the promi&s;es they had made, as if they had been put into writing, and &s;eal'd and de|liver'd before witne&s;&s;es, or Publick Notaries.</P>
<P>And that their being continually employ'd about their Plan|tations might not cau&s;e them to forget the bu&s;ine&s;s of War, and out of a di&s;tru&s;t they would degenerate in point of cou|rage, through a long and undi&s;turbed quiet; and that if occa|&s;ion &s;hould require they might be able to handle their Arms, and make u&s;e of them with dexterity, he appointed certain days for the exerci&s;ing of them, that they might thereby be minded of the Rules of Military Di&s;cipline, and order'd, that though all profe&s;s'd the cultivation of the earth, yet that they &s;hould have the generous looks and demeanors of Souldiers, and that they &s;hould at all times have about them the Badges and Liveries of that kind of Life, and &s;o never be &s;een out of their Quarters without Fire-arms, or at lea&s;t a Sword.</P>
<P>But if he requir'd them to be thus qualifi'd, to the end that when occa&s;ion &s;erv'd they might make their enemies &s;en&s;ible of their valour and courage; he on the other &s;ide oblig'd them to be mild and courteous one towards another, and that the &s;tronger &s;hould not take their advantages of the weaker. Thence it came that he made this commendable order, which is &s;till in force in all tho&s;e I&s;lands; to wit, that Ma&s;ters &s;hould not take Servants for any longer term then three years, during which time they &s;hould be oblig'd to treat them with all gentle|ne&s;s
<PB N="164" REF="96">
and moderation, and exact of them only &s;uch &s;ervices as were rational and an&s;werable to their &s;trength.</P>
<P>Nay his care and tenderne&s;s was very remarkable towards &s;uch as were newly brought into the Country: To the end therefore that at their arrival they might be &s;upply'd with all things requi&s;ite to &s;ecure them again&s;t the injuries of the air, and that their labour might not be hindred through want of convenient lodging, he de&s;ir'd, that as &s;oon as the place which they had de&s;ign'd for their building was uncover'd, all the Neighbourhood &s;hould help them in the rai&s;ing of it up: This commendable In&s;titution was &s;o well receiv'd, and &s;o carefully practi&s;ed, that all the Inhabitants generally acknowledg'd the equity of it, and took a certain plea&s;ure in making a volunta|ry contribution of their pains and cares upon that occa&s;ion: Some went to cut down &s;uch Timber as might be nece&s;&s;ary; others were to find Reeds and Palm-leaves for palizadoes and covering; the able&s;t Architects planted the forkes, rais'd the couples, and fa&s;ten'd the covering, and all &s;eem'd to be kindly concern'd in the work, &s;o as that the narrow &s;tructure was in a few days become tenantable, yet without any charge to the owner, &s;ave only to &s;ee tho&s;e charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;upply'd with the ordinary drink of the Country, as long as they were at work upon his account.</P>
<P>In fine, he had a particular aver&s;ion again&s;t tho&s;e idle per|&s;ons who are ba&s;ely content to live by the &s;weat and labour of others, as the Drones do on the Hony which the laborious Bee had brought into the common Trea&s;ury. But to retrive in our days a little glimp&s;e of the Golden Age, &s;o much celebrated by the Ancients, he incited all the Inhabitants to be liberal, and apt to communicate to one another the goods which God had plentifully be&s;tow'd on them, and to expre&s;s their charity and ho&s;pitality towards all tho&s;e who came to vi&s;it them, that &s;o there might afterwards be no occa&s;ion to &s;etle Inns and Vi|ctualling-hou&s;es among them, as being places which for the mo&s;t part &s;erv'd only for retreats to &s;lothful, debauch'd, and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">lute per&s;ons; and the di&s;orders and exce&s;&s;es committed therein were &s;o great, as in time might ha&s;ten the de&s;olation and ruine of the whole Colony.</P>
<P>But while the <HI>French</HI> Governor was thus taken up with the ordering of his little Republick, and kept up the &s;pirits of his people with the expectation of &s;udden recruits, the Gentlemen of the Company not much differing in con&s;titution from many of that Nation who think of reaping as &s;oon as they have di&s;|pos'd the &s;eed into the ground, were for their parts in a conti|nual expectation of &s;ome Ships loaden with the riche&s;t and mo&s;t precious Commodities of <HI>America,</HI> that &s;o they might be re|imburs'd with intere&s;t what they had laid out upon the fir&s;t embarquing, and till that return were come, they thought of
<PB N="165" REF="96" MS="y">
nothing le&s;s then running them&s;elves into new charges. The Governor having &s;eriou&s;ly taken it into con&s;ideration, that all the Letters he had &s;ent to tho&s;e Gentlemen upon that occa&s;ion had not obtain'd any favourable an&s;wers from them, thought it would be his be&s;t cour&s;e, ere the Colony were reduc'd to greater extremities, to come over to them in per&s;on, and by a &s;econd Voyage undertake the &s;ollicitation of that relief, upon which the &s;afety of their fir&s;t advancements, and the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the <HI>French</HI> in that I&s;land wholly depended. This good de&s;ign, which the zeal he had for the glory of his Nation had in&s;pir'd him withall, prov'd as fortunate as he could have wi&s;h'd it: For being come to <HI>Paris,</HI> he was &s;o prevalent in repre&s;enting the importance and nece&s;&s;ity of that Recruit to the Gentlemen of the Company, that they granted him three hundred men, and Ships furni&s;h'd with all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions for their tran&s;|portation to S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers.</HI></P>
<P>This Recruit &s;o impatiently expected by the Colony, happi|ly arriv'd about the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> M. DC. XXIX. and it was receiv'd with &s;o great joy by them who had &s;o long &s;tood in need of it, that now they thought nothing &s;hould ob&s;truct the execution of their de&s;igns. But it &s;eems the pro&s;perities of this life are of a &s;hort continuance; they had hardly &s;olac'd them&s;elves two months in the enjoyments of that happine&s;s, ere there comes upon them a powerful Fleet from <HI>Spain; Dom Frederick de Toledo,</HI> who had the command of it, had receiv'd expre&s;s order from his Catholick Maje&s;ty, that before he fell down to the <HI>Havanna, Carthagena,</HI> and the other more emi|nent Ports of <HI>America,</HI> he &s;hould touch at S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> and force thence all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> who had planted them|&s;elves there &s;ome years before.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of ho&s;tility committed by this Naval force, which con&s;i&s;ted of four and twenty great Ships of burthen, and fifteen Frigots, was the &s;ei&s;ure of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships then lying at Anchor neer the I&s;land of <HI>Mevis;</HI> which done, it came and ca&s;t Anchor in the Road of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> within Cannon|&s;hot of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre,</HI> where Mon&s;. <HI>de Ro&s;&s;ey</HI> had the command in chief. The Forts of both the Colonies were not yet in &s;uch a condition as to &s;tand out a &s;iege, they were unfurni&s;h'd with Provi&s;ions, and all the Ammunition, as to Powder and Shot, in the whole I&s;land could not amount to much; nay though both the Nations &s;hould have joyn'd all their forces together, yet could they not have oppos'd &s;o great an Army: But their cou|rage in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upply'd all tho&s;e defects; for that the Enemy &s;hould not brag of his having compa&s;s'd his de&s;igns without &s;ome oppo&s;ition, <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> di&s;patch'd out of the <HI>Cabes-terre,</HI> where he began to fortifie him&s;elf, all his mo&s;t ex|perienc'd Souldiers, in order to the relief of the place which was threatned by the Enemy, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ent thither four of their be&s;t Companies.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="97">The&s;e Forces being come to the appointed Rendezvouz, were joyntly employ'd with the Inhabitants of that Quarter to intrench them&s;elves along the Sea-coa&s;t, to make a more vi|gorous re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Enemy, and oppo&s;e his landing; and no doubt they would have put him to &s;ome trouble, had they been well commanded, and that fir&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s had not receiv'd &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion by the fright which &s;o &s;eiz'd the heart of <HI>de Ro&s;&s;ey</HI> that he would have &s;uffer'd them to land, and make their approaches without any re&s;i&s;tance, if a young Gentleman, Nephew to Mon&s;. <HI>De&s;nambuc,</HI> and elder Brother to Mon&s;. <HI>Par|quet</HI> the pre&s;ent Governour of <HI>Martinico,</HI> had not get leave to pa&s;s over the Works, and to engage the fir&s;t Company of the Enemy that appear'd upon the &s;ands: He was &s;econded by &s;ome Volunteers, who would needs participate of the glory of that action; but he went before them all, both as to courage and re&s;olution; for he &s;o gallantly engag'd him who had the com|mand of the party, that he kill'd him, and &s;everal others of the mo&s;t valiant about him, who had the confidence to make tryal of his valour: But being afterwards for&s;aken by tho&s;e who had follow'd him in that encounter, he was over-power'd by number, knock'd down, and carry'd into one of the enemies Ships, where after all remedies apply'd in order to his recove|ry he dy'd, to the great regret of both &s;ides, as bemoaning the misfortune of &s;uch a miracle of genero&s;ity and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>During this encounter, which &s;hould have been maintain'd with more gallantry by tho&s;e who were in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land, the General of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet immediately gave order, that all the Ships &s;hould at the &s;ame time &s;end out their Shallops full of Souldiers well arm'd, which got a &s;hore in very good order: This added not a little to the fright <HI>de Ro&s;&s;ey</HI> was in before, ina&s;much as being far from entertaining any thoughts of oppo&s;ition, out of a fear of being oppre&s;s'd by that multi|tude, he thought it his only way to make an honourable re|treat before his people were encompa&s;s'd of all &s;ides. This re|&s;olution tumultuou&s;ly taken was grumbled at by tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd the Enemy had more dearly bought the de&s;olation of their Colony; but &s;uch a general con&s;ternation was there in that fatal conjuncture, that it was carried, they &s;hould take their way towards the <HI>Cabes-terre,</HI> and that there it &s;hould be taken into futher con&s;ideration what were be&s;t to be done in order to the common &s;afety.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> perceiving that the <HI>French</HI> had quitted their Fort and their Works without making any great re&s;i&s;tance, imagin'd there might be &s;ome de&s;ign in that retreat, and that it had been made purpo&s;ely to draw him into &s;ome Ambu&s;cado laid for him in the Woods. This &s;u&s;picion kept him from pro|&s;ecuting his victory, and &s;o occa&s;ion'd his &s;tay in the Quarter of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre</HI> till he had a better account brought him of
<PB N="167" REF="97">
the &s;tate of the whole I&s;land, and him&s;elf had con&s;ider'd what was mo&s;t expedient for him to do, in order to a more &s;udden and punctual execution of his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While the Enemy continu'd in this &s;u&s;pence, and con&s;ider'd with him&s;elf how to compa&s;s his de&s;igns with lea&s;t danger, <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> extreamly &s;urpriz'd at &s;o &s;udden a change, and &s;o unexpected &s;ucce&s;s, endeavour'd to comfort his own people, and to encourage them to expre&s;s their con&s;tancy in the &s;up|porting of that mi&s;carriage. He thereupon took occa&s;ion to remon&s;trate to them, That the di&s;grace was not pa&s;t remedy; That it was not to be imagin'd the enemy would &s;tay in the I&s;land &s;o long as to force all the Inhabitants out of it; That he had affairs of greater weight, which call'd him el&s;ewhere; That he would not ea&s;ily be drawn into the Fore&s;ts, which it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould pa&s;s through ere he could come in|to his Quarter; That they might put them&s;elves into &s;uch a po|&s;ture of defence as &s;hould not only give a check to his progre&s;s, but al&s;o force him to &s;ignalize his inva&s;ion with his own blood; And la&s;tly, that there were in his way &s;ome places &s;o fortifi'd by Nature, that a few men might force him to find his way back again.</P>
<P>This advice was very &s;olid, and might have prevail'd &s;ome|what with tho&s;e to whom it was given, but the terror where|with their &s;pirits were prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and the con&s;ternation was &s;o general, that it was not weigh'd as it de&s;erv'd. The bu&s;i|ne&s;s therefore being taken into deliberation, it was concluded, that the I&s;land &s;hould be de&s;erted, and that the Colony &s;hould tran&s;port it &s;elf to &s;ome other place which might give le&s;s occa|&s;ion of jealou&s;ie to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and lye more out of the or|dinary cour&s;e of his Fleets. <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> fore&s;eeing that what pretence&s;oever might be made for the taking of that re&s;oluti|on, it would &s;till be chargeable with &s;omewhat of cowardice and ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;uch as &s;hould bla&s;t the opinion conceiv'd of the gallantry of the <HI>French,</HI> and of a &s;udden &s;mother the great hopes which &s;ome had of the advancement of their Colony, could not be per&s;waded to give his approbation thereto. How|ever, though he were of a contrary &s;entiment, that it might not be &s;aid he for&s;ook in &s;o &s;ad a conjuncture tho&s;e whom he had brought thither through &s;o many Seas and dangers, he comply'd with their humor, and embarqu'd him&s;elf with them in certain Ships which chanc'd to be in the Haven; and &s;o to avoid a greater di&s;order, doing his own inclinations a violence, he only a&s;&s;ur'd them that he &s;hould one day reproach them with the little e&s;teem they made of his remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>The Quarters where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had them&s;elves were al&s;o in a great di&s;order; they had intelligence brought them, that the enemy was become ma&s;ter of all the <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-terre;</HI> That he had demoli&s;h'd the Fortre&s;s of the <HI>French,</HI> after he had re|mov'd
<PB N="168" REF="98">
the pieces that were in it; That he had already burnt all their Huts, and made havock of all the Plantations of the Quar|ter. They were in perpetual expectation when he &s;hould come, and fall on them with all his forces, and in that appre|hen&s;ion &s;ome endeavour'd to make their e&s;cape by Sea, or &s;hel|ter them&s;elves in the Mountains, while others &s;omewhat more courageous were con&s;ulting how to &s;end Deputies to <HI>Dom Fre|deric,</HI> to entreat him to admit of &s;ome accommodation: But all the An&s;wer they receiv'd, was an expre&s;s command imme|diately to depart the I&s;land, which if they did not, they &s;hould be treated with all the rigour which the Law of Arms permits to be u&s;ed towards tho&s;e who again&s;t all right po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of what belongs not to them.</P>
<P>To facilitate the departure which <HI>Dom Frederic</HI> had &s;o impe|riou&s;ly commanded, he gave order that tho&s;e Ships which his Fleet had taken away from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> neer the I&s;land of <HI>Mevis</HI> &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to them, and that they &s;hould embarque without any delay, and immediately &s;et &s;ail for <HI>England.</HI> But whereas it was impo&s;&s;ible tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els &s;hould contain &s;o great a number of people, he permitted the &s;upernumerary to conti|nue in the I&s;land till they had a favourable opportunity for their tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>The&s;e things di&s;patch'd, <HI>Dom Frederic</HI> weigh'd Anchor, in order to the continuation of his Voyage, but as &s;oon as the Fleet was out of &s;ight, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who had been left behind in the I&s;land began to rally, and took a re&s;olution courageou&s;ly to carry on the &s;etlement of their Colony.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were in agitation at S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> who had left it at the beginning of the di&s;traction had &s;uffer'd &s;o many inconveniences at Sea, partly through want of Provi&s;ions, and partly by rea&s;on of contrary Winds, that they were forc'd to put in at the I&s;lands of S. <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Mont&s;errat,</HI> after they had by the way touch'd at that of <HI>Antego.</HI> They wi&s;h'd them&s;elves &s;o happy, as that they might have &s;etled in any of tho&s;e places; but they look'd on them as dreadful De|&s;arts in compari&s;on of that out of which they had been &s;o un|happily forc'd: The plea&s;ant Idea of that was &s;till before their eyes, it was the continual &s;ubject of their regret; and the de|lightful remembrance of that plea&s;ant abode, to the recovery whereof they were by Divine Providence re-invited by ways unknown to them, rais'd in them a de&s;ire to be inform'd what condition the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had left it in, &s;ince they were then &s;o neer it: To &s;atisfie that commendable curio&s;ity, they &s;ent one of their Ships to S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> which returning gave them an account, that the Enemies Fleet was gone; and that the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> who were left behind were courageou&s;ly employ'd in re|building their Hutts, planting Provi&s;ions, and repairing their de&s;olations.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="98">This unexpected good News reviv'd their decay'd hopes, and heightned the courage of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t ca&s;t down, &s;o that there needed not many arguments ro per&s;wade them to a return into that delightful Country which was already po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of their hearts and tendere&s;t affections.</P>

<P><HI>Du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> reflecting on the misfortunes and inconveniences which daily fell one in the neck of another upon that un&s;etled Colony, and having ju&s;t grounds to fear that other yet great|er might happen to it, took it &s;o much to heart, that he dyed out of pure grief, in the &s;eventh month after his arrival.

&s;everal incur&s;ions into <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> and became &s;uch goads and thorns in the &s;ides of the <HI>French,</HI> that they were forc'd to give over the culture of Tobacco, nay indeed the planting of tho&s;e provi&s;ions which were nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to the end they might always be in Arms, to prevent the attempts and de&s;igns of tho&s;e &s;ubtle enemies, whom they had by their own imprudence &s;o much exa&s;perated again&s;t them.</P>
<P>This cruel War, which la&s;ted neer four years, reduc'd the Colony to great extremities, and brought it to &s;o deplora|ble a condition, that it was out of repute in all places; and upon its being continually pe&s;ter'd by the incur&s;ions and de|predations of the irreconcileable <HI>Caribbians,</HI> it was conclu|ded to be at no great di&s;tance from its utter de&s;truction.

<P>This Gentleman was a per&s;on of much gallantry, of ea&s;ie acce&s;s, familiar with all, and ma&s;ter of a happy kind of in|&s;inuation, &s;uch as gently forc'd the love and obedience of tho&s;e who were under him. It is related of him, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having gone a little beyond the boundaries which by the mutual agreement concluded between both Nations had been &s;et for the di&s;tinction of their &s;everal Quarters, he went to tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> attended by a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, and &s;poke with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governour, who expected him with a con&s;iderable number of Souldiers: But he behav'd him&s;elf with &s;o much courage and re&s;olution, and gave &s;uch good rea&s;ons, intermixt with menaces, for what he did, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governour granted him what he de&s;ir'd.

<P>AFter the death of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;nambuc,</HI> one Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Halde,</HI> who was his Lieutenant in that Government, was nominated to be Governour in Chief by the Gentlemen of the Company: But not long after, the &s;aid <HI>du Halde</HI> coming over into <HI>France,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> who&s;e care extended to the mo&s;t remote places where the <HI>French</HI> had any thing to do, un|dertook the con&s;ervation and advancement of that Colony in <HI>America,</HI> out of an endeavour to render the name of <HI>France</HI> as glorious in that part of the new World, as it was here. To carry on that de&s;ign he thought it requi&s;ite that the I&s;lands &s;hould be &s;upply'd with a Governour accordingly: Having therefore &s;ome while &s;ought for a per&s;on fit for that Employ|ment, one eminent for his conduct, prudence, genero&s;ity, and the experience requi&s;ite for &s;o great a charge, he at la&s;t pitch'd upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lonvilliers Poincy</HI> Knight, a Gentleman of a very ancient Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Cardinal pre&s;ented this excellent Per&s;on to King <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. who approving the choice, inve&s;ted him with the Charge of Governour, and Lieutenant-General under his Ma|je&s;ty in the I&s;lands of <HI>America:</HI> Whereupon Letters Patents were granted him in <HI>September</HI> M. DC. XXXVIII. That qua|lity had not been given to any of tho&s;e who had preceded him in the Government of tho&s;e I&s;lands.</P>
<P>In the Year M. DC.

<P>Immediately upon his reception the I&s;land began to put on a new face, and within a &s;hort time after things were vi&s;ibly chang'd from better to better; in&s;omuch that he not only an|&s;wer'd
<PB N="174" REF="101">
but exceeded the expectations of his Maje&s;ty and the Cardinal. One of the fir&s;t things he did, was to give order for the building of Churches in &s;everal Quarters of the I&s;land: He took care that the Prie&s;ts &s;hould be well lodg'd and main|tain'd, that they might not be diverted from the employments of their Function: He made &s;uch provi&s;ions in the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, as rendred it expeditious, and without Fees, by means of a Council con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t prudent and experi|enc'd among the Officers of the I&s;land: His vigilance reform'd and prevented the di&s;orders which ea&s;ily creep in among per|&s;ons &s;huffled together from divers places, and of different hu|mours: His prudence in compo&s;ing and &s;etling matters of greate&s;t difficulty was equally admir'd by tho&s;e who were un|der his Government, and his Neighbours of other Nations. That greatne&s;s of mind, which &s;ucce&s;sfully guided him to the accompli&s;hment of all his de&s;igns, made him dreadful to all re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;-&s;atisfy'd &s;pirits: His affability, ea&s;ine&s;s of ac|ce&s;s, and his kind entertainment towards Strangers, brought Trading and plenty into the I&s;land; and his goodne&s;s and libe|rality ju&s;tly gain'd the hearts and affections of the <HI>French:</HI> In a word, his Genero&s;ity &s;ignaliz'd in many occurrences as well in <HI>France,</HI> during the noble Employments he had in his Maje&s;ties Armies, as in <HI>America</HI> &s;ince his Government there, in the pre|&s;ervation, dilatation, and reduction of &s;o many con&s;iderable places, wrought &s;uch a terrour in the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that he never &s;ince proffer'd to oppo&s;e his glorious Enterprizes.</P>
<P>Having &s;etled S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> in good order as to Trading, and all other Concerns, and made it the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing I|&s;land of all the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> as we have repre&s;ented it in the fourth Chapter of the precedent Book, he afterwards ex|tended the <HI>French</HI> Colony into tho&s;e of S. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> S. <HI>Martins,</HI> and <HI>Santa Cruce,</HI> whereof we have given an account in their proper places, yet &s;o as we &s;till have many con&s;ide|rable circum&s;tances to deliver concerning the Conque&s;t of the I&s;land of <HI>Santa Cruce,</HI> which we &s;hall here take occa&s;ion to in&s;ert.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Santa Cruce</HI> hath been &s;ubject to many Ma|&s;ters in a &s;hort time, and for many years together the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;ome conte&s;tations about the propriety of it: At la&s;t they made a divi&s;ion of it between them; but in the Year M.

But they al&s;o continu'd not long Ma&s;ters of it; for &s;oon after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who were Inhabitants of the I&s;land of <HI>Porto-Rico</HI> made an incur&s;ion into it, burnt their hou&s;es, put to the &s;word all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> they found in Arms, and or|der'd the re&s;t with their baggage and wives to be tran&s;port|ed to the <HI>Barbouthos.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="101">Having thus laid the I&s;land de&s;olate, as they were &s;etting things in order for their returning aboard their Ve&s;&s;els, and to take their cour&s;e back to <HI>Porto-Rico,</HI> there arrives thither a Ship from the I&s;lands of S. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> and S. <HI>Martins,</HI> wherein there were a con&s;iderable number of men, who having re|ceiv'd intelligence of the defeat of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and imagining that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were gone, would have reviv'd the preten|&s;ions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to that I&s;land: but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having the advantage, as being ten to one, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were forc'd to ac|cept of &s;uch terms of accommodation as the others were pleas'd to give them. The crafty <HI>Spaniards</HI> had indeed pro|mis'd them good quarter, but their de&s;ign was to tran&s;port them to <HI>Porto-Rico</HI> to their Governour, who, according to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> humour, would not have treated them over-chri&s;tianly.</P>
<P>But as good fortune would have it, ju&s;t as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were preparing for their return with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pri&s;oners, who had &s;o unfortunately fallen into their hands, two <HI>French</HI> Ships well mann'd, and furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, arriv'd in the I&s;land, &s;ent thither by the <HI>French</HI> General <HI>de Poincy,</HI> to &s;end the <HI>Spaniard</HI> packing thence, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the King of <HI>France.</HI> This relief came in very &s;ea&s;onably for the deliverance of the &s;urpriz'd <HI>Dutch;</HI> for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> perceiving the <HI>French</HI> landing cheerfully and in good order, and making a con&s;iderable Body of gallant men, and ready to fight, immediately let go their Pri&s;oners; and after a &s;hort capitulation, the <HI>French</HI> &s;ent them an expre&s;s order to be gone aboard their Ships, with a menace that if they did not, they would fall upon them as Enemies, and that they were not to expect any Quarter. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> thought it their be&s;t cour&s;e rather to comply then &s;tand to the hazard of an engagement, though they much exceeded the <HI>French</HI> in number.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> General taking it into his con&s;ideration, of what importance the I&s;land in time might be, e&s;pecially in order to the facilitation of other acque&s;ts of greater concernment, thought it worthy his endeavours to &s;ecure what he had &s;o for|tunately po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of, and thereupon &s;ent a prudent and experienc'd Governour to command there under him: The per&s;on he pitch'd on for that Employment was Mon&s;ieur <HI>Auber,</HI> Major of the I&s;land of S. <HI>Christophers,</HI> who had exercis'd that Charge with great approbation for many years together; but now he was advanc'd to the quality of Governour of that I&s;land: He died in the exerci&s;e of that Charge, to the great regret of all the Inhabitants, after he had &s;etled the I&s;land in good order, recover'd its ruines, and laid the foundations of a Fort which he had de&s;ign'd him&s;elf for the &s;ecurity of &s;uch Ships as &s;hould afterwards come into the Haven, and to defeat the hopes of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to make any more incur&s;ions there,

<P>At the fir&s;t coming of the forreign Nations into the I&s;lands, they were lodg'd much after the &s;ame manner as the natural Inhabitants of the Country, in little cotts and hutts made of the wood they had fell'd upon the place as they clear'd the ground. There are &s;till to be &s;een, in &s;everal of the newly|planted Colonies, many of tho&s;e weak &s;tructures, which are &s;u&s;tain'd only by four or &s;ix forks planted in the ground, and in&s;tead of walls are encompa&s;s'd and palizado'd only with reeds, and cover'd with Palm or Plantane&punc; leaves, Sugar-canes, or &s;ome &s;uch material: But in all the other I&s;lands, where the&s;e Nations are better &s;etled and accommodated, there&punc; are many very fair hou&s;es of Timber, Stone, and Brick, built af|ter the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e in their own Countries, &s;ave that for the mo&s;t part they are but one or two Stories high at the mo&s;t, that they may the more ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;t the winds, which &s;ometimes blow in tho&s;e parts with extraordinary violence.

<P>THe fir&s;t among the <HI>French</HI> who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land of <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> landed there in the Year 1635. by order from a Company of Merchants of the City of <HI>Deep,</HI> which, under the Authority of the General Company of the I&s;lands of <HI>America</HI> con&s;tituted at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;ent thither two Gen|tlemen, <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> and <HI>de l' Olive,</HI> to command there upon their account: But the former dying &s;ome few months after his e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the other becoming unfit for the govern|ment of a new-planted Colony, through the lo&s;s of his &s;ight, and his continual indi&s;po&s;itions, as we have mentioned in the precedent Chapters, the <HI>French</HI> Governour-General took or|der that the Inhabitants of that I&s;land &s;hould be &s;upply'd with all things nece&s;&s;ary: For it is probable they would have ab&s;o|lutely for&s;aken it, had not the &s;aid Governour &s;ent over re|cruits of Auxiliaries to them, under the conduct of <HI>Vernade</HI> and <HI>Sabouilly,</HI> to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who with much animo&s;ity di&s;puted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it with them: So that if that Colony is not oblig'd for its e&s;tabli&s;hment to the General <HI>de Poincy,</HI> this at lea&s;t mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that its pre&s;ervation and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was the effect of his care.

down to S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> the Ship which had brought him out of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>America</HI> ca&s;ting Anchor neer <HI>Dominico,</HI> many of the Savages, who had ob&s;erv'd the Ship at a di&s;tance, and concluded from the expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip which had been made to them, that they had no enemies in that Ve&s;&s;el, grew &s;o confident as to come into it. It fortunately happen'd, that tho&s;e who had come out upon the di&s;covery were &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t Captains of the I&s;land: M. <HI>Auber</HI> re&s;olv'd to make all the advantage he could of that opportunity, imagining it might conduce very much to the making of an alliance with that people, which had been exa&s;perated and incens'd again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> by the violences and cruel u&s;age of <HI>de l' Olive,</HI> one of his Predece&s;&s;ors in that Charge, as al&s;o by the ill conduct of tho&s;e who commanded the Recruits which the General had &s;ent over for the &s;ecurity of the I&s;land: And having withal an inkling that tho&s;e of that Nation are ea&s;ily drawn in by kind|ne&s;&s;es and little Pre&s;ents, he omitted nothing which he con|ceiv'd might promote his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>He thereupon acquainted them, that he was newly come from <HI>France,</HI> and that he was &s;ent over to be Governour of <HI>Gardeloupe;</HI> that he had been&punc; much troubled to hear of the, differences which for &s;ome years had continued between them and the <HI>French;</HI> that he was come with an intention to make a friendly compo&s;ure thereof; and that he would be their Companion and good Neighbour, and live with them, as their late old friend M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> had done. The&s;e proffers were interrupted now and then with gla&s;&s;es of <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> which he order'd ever and anon to be pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Savages finding &s;o free and cordial a reception, after they had di&s;cours'd a while among them&s;elves, in the Language they &s;peak, concerning their military affairs, which is under|&s;tood only by the mo&s;t ancient Conductors of their Enterpri|zes, re&s;olv'd to accept of the proffer which had been made them, and to renew the ancient amity, by renouncing what|ever might tend to the pro&s;ecution of that bloody War which had &s;o much incommodated both parties. But before they would promi&s;e any thing, they ask'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>Auber,</HI> whether <HI>l' Olive, Sabouilly,</HI> and all tho&s;e who had follow'd their violent cour&s;es, &s;hould be forc'd to depart the I&s;land? Whereto it be|ing an&s;wer'd that they &s;hould, they reply'd, that it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be &s;o, and that otherwi&s;e they &s;hould &s;till have an animo&s;ity again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>l' Olive and Sabouilly are not good for the Caribbians:</HI> Tho&s;e were their words. Where|upon M. <HI>Auber</HI> having a&s;&s;ur'd them that their de&s;ires &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd, and that for his part he would be good to them, if they on their parts would be good; which they promis'd to be. The&s;e things concluded, he gave them a very noble treatment, be&s;tow'd &s;ome Pre&s;ents among them, and di&s;mi&s;s'd
<PB N="180" REF="104">
them the mo&s;t &s;atisfy'd people in the world.</P>
<P>From the road of <HI>Dominico</HI> M. <HI>Auber</HI> went to <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> where having di&s;pos'd his equipage he return'd to S. <HI>Christo|phers,</HI> to give the General an account of what had pa&s;t, who was well &s;atisfy'd with the choice which the Company had made of him for that Employment.</P>
<P>Being return'd to his Government, he was gallantly receiv'd by all the Inhabitants, who e&s;teem'd him for his experience in whatever might contribute to the advancement of newly|planted Colonies, as al&s;o out of a per&s;wa&s;ion, that his prudence would remedy the di&s;orders pa&s;t, and his genero&s;ity oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent difficulties, and undertake all things requi&s;ite for the quiet and welfare of the I&s;land; and his mildne&s;s and af|fability would gain him the affections of all there, as they had done at S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> where he had been accounted one of their be&s;t Captains. His Commi&s;&s;ion was read and publi&s;h'd two Sundays together, at the head of all the Companies of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The War which had been fomented between the Savages and the <HI>French</HI> by the ill coun&s;el of &s;ome re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits, and the credulity of the precedent Governour who had harkned thereto, together with the differences, jealou&s;ies and animo&s;i|ties which tho&s;e boutefeus had rais'd among the principal In|habitants of the I&s;land, had rendred it the mo&s;t de&s;olate of all the Colonies of <HI>America:</HI> Want of provi&s;ions had reduc'd many to &s;o great extremities, that life grew weari&s;om to them, and death was the object of their wi&s;hes: The continual fear they were in of being &s;urpriz'd by the Savages, oblig'd them to be always in Arms, and to leave their Gardens and Plantations uncultivated; and the in&s;upportable treatment they receiv'd from &s;ome Officers who abus'd their Authority, had brought them to the thre&s;hold of inevitable de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But a&s;&s;oon as M. <HI>Auber</HI> had a&s;&s;um'd the Government, by the unanimous acclamations of all the Inhabitants, and brought them the news of an a&s;&s;ured peace, which he had concluded with the Savages their neighbours, and hop'd very &s;uddenly to &s;ee confirm'd by all the a&s;&s;urances could be expected from a Nation &s;o unciviliz'd as that of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> the di&s;turbers of the publick tranquillity were di&s;pers'd, and the well-affe|cted found them&s;elves in &s;afety under the prudent conduct of &s;o worthy a Governour, who us'd all po&s;&s;ible endeavours to bring the I&s;land to a perfect &s;etlement: In&s;omuch that the Co|lony &s;eem'd to have put on a new face; Ju&s;tice began to flou|ri&s;h; the unity and labours of the Inhabitants retriv'd the plenty, trading, and peace, which had been forc'd thence be|fore; and the pious example of the Commander in chief had the expected influence over all the members of that Colony.</P>
<P>Though he had motion'd a Treaty of peace with the Sava|ges,
<PB N="181" REF="104">
yet did he conceive it expedient, for fear of a &s;urprize, that the Inhabitants &s;hould &s;till keep their Guards: Accord|ingly he planted Sentinels in all tho&s;e places where the <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> might mo&s;t ea&s;ily land without being di&s;cover'd: He chang'd the Guards, and plac'd them in other more ad|vantagious places; and he thought it prudence to keep under tho&s;e who would have ruin'd the fir&s;t foundations he had laid of the firm peace and alliance with tho&s;e reconciled enemies, charging the former by expre&s;s prohibitions to forbear all acts of ho&s;tility, that they might not by their particular animo&s;i|ties ob&s;truct the general agreement wherein all the Inhabitants were &s;o much concern'd.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Governour taking further into his con&s;ideration, that the I&s;lands were to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by Trading; that nothing puts a greater &s;lurre upon them then the bad Commodities vented therein; and that Tobacco was the only Commodity at that time of any e&s;teem at <HI>Gardeloupe;</HI> and that &s;everal per&s;ons put off what was not merchantable, which procedure had caus'd the I&s;land to be &s;lighted by Forreigners, who upon that account had forborn &s;ending any Ships thither; he ap|pointed certain per&s;ons who well under&s;tood the management of Tobacco, and the&s;e carefully examin'd the making up of it, and had order to ca&s;t into the Sea what was decay'd, or wanted tho&s;e qualities it ought to have to be allowable.</P>
<P>This good order taken, as well in order to military affairs as policy, brought the I&s;land in a &s;hort time into a flouri&s;hing condition; and the report of its amendment occa&s;ion'd the coming thither of many Merchants, and invited a great num|ber of con&s;iderable families to &s;etle them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>But to return to the Savages who had vi&s;ited M. <HI>Auber</HI> in his Ship at his fir&s;t arrival, and had treated with him about a peace, upon the conditions before-mentioned; they were no &s;ooner got home into their Country, where they were expect|ed with much impatience, upon this &s;core, that they had con|tinu'd a great while in the Ship, but they celebrated all over the I&s;land the noble entertainment they had receiv'd from the Governour newly come from <HI>France.</HI> The con&s;iderable Pre|&s;ents he had be&s;tow'd on them was an authentick a&s;&s;urance of his goodne&s;s and liberality. To this they added, that their enemies, <HI>l' Olive</HI> and <HI>Sabouilly,</HI> being ordered to depart <HI>Garde|loupe,</HI> they had made a peace with that brave Companion, who had treated them &s;o kindly, that he was worthy of their alli|ance. That he might take no further occa&s;ion of di&s;tru&s;t, they urg'd the nece&s;&s;ity there was that they &s;hould forbear making tho&s;e incur&s;ions into <HI>Gardeloupe</HI> which they had been wont to make in the time of War: And that when certain news came that the new Governour was fully e&s;tabli&s;h'd in his Government, they would give him a vi&s;it, carry him Pre&s;ents,
<PB N="182" REF="105">
and &s;olemnly confirm that peace which was likely to prove &s;o advantagious for the future. The <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who had lo&s;t many of their men in the former engagements again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and grew weary of dealing with &s;uch expert enemies, were glad to hear what was propos'd to them by the principal Captains in their Country: So that they approv'd all that had pa&s;s'd between them and the <HI>French</HI> Governour, and behav'd them&s;elves as they &s;hould do in order to the confirmation of the peace.</P>
<P>About the &s;pace of five months the Savages punctually ob&s;erv'd the promi&s;e they had made to M. <HI>Auber,</HI> of not giving any further di&s;turbance to the <HI>French:</HI> Imagining that time &s;ufficient to let all the Inhabitants of <HI>Gardeloupe</HI> know what alliance had been contracted at the road of <HI>Dominico,</HI> they re&s;olv'd to &s;end thither a &s;olemn Deputation, to con|firm the peace, and wi&s;h the Governour all pro&s;perity. There was a great competition among the Savages who &s;hould be ho|nour'd with a Commi&s;&s;ion of &s;o great importance: They re|&s;olv'd then, to &s;atisfie the mo&s;t eminent among them who were competitors for that Emba&s;&s;ie, to pitch upon two of their mo&s;t ancient and mo&s;t renowned Captains, and to give each of them a con&s;iderable Convoy, con&s;i&s;ting of the choice of their brave&s;t Officers and Souldiers: And that there might be no jealou&s;ie among the Captains, they thought it fit they &s;hould depart in two &s;everal <HI>Piragas,</HI> each of them with his retinue, and in &s;uch order as that one &s;hould precede the other by one day.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t of the&s;e Emba&s;&s;adours was call'd Captain <HI>Ami|chon,</HI> a per&s;on very con&s;iderable among them, and he was ac|company'd by thirty of the mo&s;t active and mo&s;t expert of <HI>Do|minico.</HI> M. <HI>Auber</HI> was wont to &s;ay, that he had never &s;een any Savages &s;o well &s;hap'd and active as they were. The&s;e Savages therefore, relying on the promi&s;e he had made them in the Road, landed at <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> where hearing by the Guards that M. <HI>Auber</HI> was in the I&s;land, and in good health, they confidently landed, and de&s;ired to &s;ee him, having in the mean time left &s;ome of the le&s;s con&s;iderable of their party to look to the <HI>Piraga.</HI> While &s;ome went to acquaint the Governour with the arrival of the&s;e Deputies of <HI>Dominico,</HI> Captain <HI>Amichon,</HI> who was to be the Speaker, di&s;patch'd a|way two of his retinue loaden with the be&s;t fruits of their Country, which they had brought along with them for a Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Governour was extremely glad to hear of their arrival, and having immediately commanded all tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold and the whole Quarter not to give them the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to fear any ill treatment, he would needs go him&s;elf to meet them, with a countenance which &s;uffici|ently
<PB N="183" REF="105" MS="y">
expre&s;s'd how welcome they were. We &s;hall not trou|ble our &s;elves to in&s;ert here the Speech and Complements made by Captain <HI>Amichon</HI> at this fir&s;t interview: He was one of tho&s;e who had vi&s;ited M. <HI>Auber</HI> in his Ship, &s;o that he ea&s;i|ly knew him again. He immediately gave him to under&s;tand, that he was come to confirm what they had re&s;olv'd together at the Road of <HI>Dominico</HI> concerning the peace; and that all the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of his Country were de&s;irous of it. The <HI>French</HI> Governour in an&s;wer thereto, made them &s;en&s;ible as well by his Interpreter as his countenance, that for his part he would inviolably ob&s;erve that union, provided they were not the fir&s;t breakers of it. Having afterwards brought them to his hou&s;e, and knowing that good cheer was the be&s;t &s;eal could be put to that Treaty of peace, he call'd for &s;ome Aqua-vitae, and order'd to be brought what was mo&s;t delicious in the I&s;land: At la&s;t he crown'd the Entertainment with Pre&s;ents of all the curio&s;ities mo&s;t in e&s;teem among the Savages. And that all the Deputies might participate of the good cheer and liberality of the Governour, tho&s;e who had been treated went to relieve tho&s;e who were left behind to look to the <HI>Piraga,</HI> who al&s;o in their turn receiv'd the &s;ame treatment and Pre|&s;ents which the others had had. Captain <HI>Amichon</HI> forgot not, according to the cu&s;tom they ob&s;erve towards their friends, to take M. <HI>Auber</HI>'s name, and to give him his own.</P>
<P>Having been thus civilly receiv'd and treated, they return'd very joyfully to their <HI>Piraga,</HI> and &s;et &s;ail towards their own I&s;land: They met at a certain rendezvouz, which they had agreed upon before they had left <HI>Dominico,</HI> with the other <HI>Piraga,</HI> which brought over the other Emba&s;&s;adour, who&s;e name was Captain <HI>Baron,</HI> with his retinue. This &s;econd Captain under&s;tanding from the former what reception he and his retinue had at <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> got thither the next day. This <HI>Baron</HI> had been a great friend of M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> who dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d Governour of <HI>Gardeloupe,</HI> but having equal authority with M. <HI>de l' Olive,</HI> his Collegue, who after <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> death impru|dently engag'd the <HI>French</HI> into a War with the Savages.</P>
<P>This Captain then, who had often vi&s;ited M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and remembred the friend&s;hip he had born him, being &s;atisfy'd of the genero&s;ity of the <HI>French,</HI> went a&s;hore with his Company, and was conducted to the Governour's, who treated him with the &s;ame ceremonies as he had done the former: But when he came to hear that the Captain had been intimately acquainted with M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and that there had been a familiar corre|&s;pondence between them, he treated him with greater te&s;ti|monies of affection then he had done the others, and en|ter'd into a particular friend&s;hip with him, receiving his name, and giving him his own. Thus was the latter Depu|tation di&s;mi&s;s'd with greater &s;atisfaction then the former,

and promis'd to continue their vi&s;its for the future: But both of them gave a large account at their <HI>Carbetts,</HI> of the civilities and good entertainment of the new Governour.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Baron,</HI> who had been &s;o kindly receiv'd at his fir&s;t vi&s;it, &s;taid not long ere he made a &s;econd: At the latter the Governour &s;hew'd him one of M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> Sons, to whom the Captain made a thou&s;and care&s;&s;es, in remembrance of his Fa|ther, whom he call'd his Companion, and the Friend of his Nation. True it is, that Gentleman had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the affection of tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians;</HI> who had a re&s;pect for his merits and excellent endowments.</P>
<P>After this vi&s;it, and &s;everal others which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> dai|ly made, M. <HI>Auber</HI> would be a&s;&s;ur'd of them by Ho&s;tages, that they would ob&s;erve the alliance: To that purpo&s;e he apply'd him&s;elf to Captain <HI>Baron,</HI> with whom he had contracted a greater friend&s;hip then with the others, and whom he call'd his Companion, as &s;ucceeding to the alliance there had &s;ometime been between him and M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is.</HI> M. <HI>Auber</HI> a&s;k'd him one day, whether he thought it not rational, that, to be a&s;&s;ur'd of tho&s;e of his Nation, he &s;hould require &s;ome of their children to be deliver'd up to him as Ho&s;tages? The Captain, who was of a judgment and under&s;tanding much beyond the ordinary rate of Savages, immediately reply'd, that the mutual &s;afety was to be procur'd upon equal conditions; and that if they deliver'd up &s;ome of their children to the <HI>French,</HI> it was but ju&s;t the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould do the like with them. He thereupon pre&s;ented to M. <HI>Auber</HI> &s;ome of his own children who had ac|company'd him; and the other accepting of the proffer, made choice of one of them, a young lad, who&s;e countenance and demeanour was &s;omewhat more plea&s;ing and attractive, in a word, one who was in &s;everal re&s;pects more amiable then any of his brethren: The Father was content to part with his Son, and the Son was content to &s;tay with M. <HI>Auber;</HI> an accident that &s;eldom happens among the Savages. His name was <HI>Ima|labouy.</HI> From that day M. <HI>Auber</HI> treated him as his Son, and always call'd him &s;o; and the young Fellow call'd him Fa|ther. When he was put into cloaths, he made a &s;hift to be|have him&s;elf well enough; nor did he find it any hard mat|ter to enure him&s;elf to the <HI>European</HI> cour&s;e of life. Captain <HI>Baron</HI> de&s;ir'd to have as a counter-ho&s;tage one of Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Au|ber</HI>'s Sons, who had been fir&s;t wife to M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> and was then married to M. <HI>Auber:</HI> But M. <HI>Auber</HI> having repre&s;ented to the Captain, that young <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is</HI> was of too &s;oft a na|ture to endure the hard&s;hip of a <HI>Caribbian</HI> life, prevail'd with him to accept by way of Ho&s;tage, in&s;tead of him, one of his Servants, who willingly proffer'd to follow him. That young man being of a &s;trong con&s;titution, continu'd &s;ome moneths among the Savages, who treated him with much

kindne&s;s; but whether the change of air, or nouri&s;hment caus'd &s;ome alteration in him, he fell &s;ick &s;ome time after: Which Captain <HI>Baron</HI> hearing of, and fearing he might dye among them, he brought him back to M. <HI>Auber,</HI> and requir'd not any other per&s;on in his &s;tead, &s;aying that he would have no other Ho&s;tage then the word of his Companion. True it is, he would have per&s;waded his own Son to return along with him, but he could not prevail with him, the Youth tell|ing him, that he thought him&s;elf in a better condition with M. <HI>Auber</HI> then with his Father.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Baron</HI> having left at <HI>Gardeloupe</HI> &s;o precious an en|gagement, took occa&s;ion to make frequent vi&s;its to M. <HI>Auber,</HI> and by that means to &s;ee his Son: And finding him&s;elf ex|tremely oblig'd to M. <HI>Auber</HI> for the many favours he receiv'd from him, e&s;pecially for the tender affection he bore his Son, he bethought him&s;elf to find out &s;ome occa&s;ions whereby he might expre&s;s his acknowledgments thereof: He re&s;olv'd therefore to make a di&s;covery to him, that during the Wars between tho&s;e of his Nation and the <HI>French,</HI> who were com|manded by <HI>l' Olive,</HI> he had taken a young <HI>French</HI>-man Pri&s;o|ner, and had given him his life only upon this &s;core, that he had &s;ometime been a Servant to M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> his old Compa|nion: And that it was neer three years that he had him, and gave him more then ordinary liberty, though it had been in his power to put him to death, becau&s;e he was taken in Arms, and in the heat of the Engagement: But that he had not us'd extremity, remembring the ancient friend&s;hip between him and M. <HI>du Ple&s;&s;is,</HI> in who&s;e attendance he had &s;een that <HI>French</HI>|man. M. <HI>Auber</HI> compa&s;&s;ionating the young mans condition, entreated the Captain to deliver him up; which he promis'd, and not many days after was as good as his word; and he who&s;e good fortune it was to be thus retriv'd, &s;taid a long time after at <HI>Gardeloupe.</HI></P>
<P>The generous Captain, not thinking it enough to have thus oblig'd M. <HI>Auber,</HI> and parted with his Pri&s;oner, told him of another Captain of <HI>Dominico</HI> who al&s;o had a <HI>French</HI>-man in his hou&s;e, a Pri&s;oner at War, and proffer'd to &s;ollicite that Cap|tain to &s;et him at liberty. He prevail'd, and &s;ome days after brought over that other Pri&s;oner, who&s;e name was <HI>Jean Jardin.</HI> This being a &s;ubtle young fellow had gain'd the affe|ctions not only of the Captain, who&s;e Pri&s;oner he was, but al&s;o of all the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who had as much kindne&s;s for him as if he had been of their own Nation: And he had &s;uch an excellent memory, that he had got their Language in per|fection.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Auber</HI> de&s;irous to make &s;ome return of the&s;e good offices and expre&s;&s;ions of affection, be&s;ides the Pre&s;ents he daily made the Captain, would needs oblige his whole Nation&punc;

It was when the Captain was engag'd for the War again&s;t the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> who inhabit <HI>Trinity</HI>-I&s;land, and to that pur|po&s;e had made extraordinary preparations. For this nobly|minded Savage coming to take leave of M. <HI>Auber</HI> before he went upon that expedition, he be&s;tow'd on him, to be put in|to his party, one of his menial Servants, who was his Fowler, named <HI>Des Seri&s;&s;iers,</HI> who had a long time wi&s;h'd him&s;elf pre|&s;ent at the Engagements of tho&s;e Savages; and he furni&s;h'd him with good fire-arms, and all things requi&s;ite to make u&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Baron</HI> was much a&s;toni&s;h'd at that favour, and having joyfully accepted of it, made extraordinary declarati|ons thereof among tho&s;e of his own Nation. This Volunteer very cheerfully follow'd the Captain, and was at the Engage|ment with the <HI>Arouagues</HI> of <HI>Trinity</HI>-I&s;land, to which there came a powerful Army of Savages from all the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands. The <HI>French</HI>-man did as much upon that occa&s;ion as could be expected from a gallant Souldier; and being a good marks|man, he hurt and wounded &s;o many of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> who were not accu&s;tomed to feel the effect of fire-arms, that at la&s;t they took the rout, and retreated into the mountains, leaving the &s;poil to the victorious <HI>Caribbians.</HI> From that time <HI>Se|ri&s;&s;iers</HI> was ever look'd upon by tho&s;e of that Nation as a great Captain; and they could not &s;ufficiently admire the kindne&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Governour, who voluntarily depriv'd him&s;elf of that young mans &s;ervice, and lent him to them. All the particulars of this relation we have from very good hands, e&s;pecially M. <HI>Auber</HI>'s.</P>
<P>During all the time of M. <HI>Auber</HI>'s government of <HI>Garde|loupe,</HI> the peace made with the <HI>Caribbians</HI> was inviolably ob|&s;erv'd on both &s;ides, to the great advantage of both Nati|ons: For the Savages by that agreement had the opportunity to treat with the <HI>French</HI> for wedges, hooks, knives, and &s;everal other in&s;truments and commodities which they look upon as the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary: And the <HI>French</HI> receiv'd from them in ex|change, Swine, Lizards, Sea-Turtles or Tortoi&s;es, and an infi|nite number of other fi&s;hes, and other refre&s;hments, whereof they made a good advantage.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Trading and Employments of the Forreign Inha|bitants of the Country; and fir&s;t, of the culture and ordering of Tobacco.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Caribbies</HI> Money is not us'd in order to the carrying on of ordinary Traffick, but this is perform'd by the ex|changing of tho&s;e Commodities which are of the growth of the Country for &s;uch as are brought out of <HI>Europe,</HI> whether they con&s;i&s;t in Cloaths, Linnen, Ammunition, or Provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries requi&s;ite for the better conveniences and enjoyments of life. And this was the common cour&s;e of all Nations before the u&s;e of Money, and is to this day practis'd in divers &s;avage Countries, and particularly in <HI>Colchida,</HI> where every one brings to the Market what he hath &s;uperfluous, to &s;upply him&s;elf with what he wants.</P>
<P>The Store-hou&s;es and Magazines of the&s;e I&s;lands are com|monly well furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Commodities which are brought out of <HI>England, France, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> nay as plentifully as in any place in the world. The price of eve|ry Commodity is not left to the choice of the Merchants who keep the Store-hou&s;es, but &s;et upon it by the Gover|nours, with the advice of their Council. The Commodities which the Inhabitants bring in exchange for tho&s;e before|mentioned, are reducible to five &s;pecies; to wit, Tobacco, Sugar, Ginger, Indico, and Cotton.</P>
<P>At the beginning all the forreign Inhabitants of the <HI>Ca|ribbies</HI> apply'd them&s;elves wholly to the culture of Tobac|co, whereby they made a &s;hift to get a competent livelihood; but afterwards the abundance that was made bringing down the price of it, they have in &s;everal places employ'd them|&s;elves in the planting of Sugar-canes, Ginger, and Indico: And it hath pleas'd God &s;o to pro&s;per their de&s;igns, that it is almo&s;t a miracle to &s;ee with what improvement all the&s;e Commodities grow in mo&s;t of the I&s;lands. And fora&s;much as many who &s;ee them in <HI>Europe</HI> know not how they are or|der'd, it will be a great &s;atisfaction to their curio&s;ity, to give a &s;hort account of each of them; whereto we &s;hall adde &s;omewhat concerning Cotton.</P>
<P>True it is, that divers Authors have already treated of them; but in regard our Hi&s;tory would be defective, if no|thing &s;hould be &s;aid concerning them, we are in the fir&s;t place to a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that the whole di&s;cour&s;e we in|tend to make thereof is not a Copy or Extract out of any other, but a true Original naturally taken with much care
<PB N="188" REF="108" MS="y">
and fidelity: So that if we &s;ay the &s;ame things as others have done before us, tho&s;e who &s;hall peru&s;e our work will not be much troubled to find here the confirmation of a truth which comes from &s;o remote a part of the world, and whereof they cannot have too great an a&s;&s;urance: And if they find any thing that &s;eems to cla&s;h with &s;ome precedent relations, they are to look on it as a di&s;covery of the fal&s;hood of tho&s;e which are contrary thereto: Or at lea&s;t ours will make it apparent, that in all places the Planters do not &s;o exactly follow the &s;ame method in the ordering of the&s;e Commodities, but that &s;ometimes &s;ome alteration may be ob&s;erv'd therein. Be&s;ides, we have this further hope, that &s;ome will find in the following de&s;criptions a certain exactne&s;s and cleerne&s;s which they will think not unacceptable to them; nay they may haply meet with &s;omething therein that is new, and &s;uch as hath not been ob&s;erv'd by any other Authors: But if there be any who &s;hall think there is not any thing in this and the next Chapter which they know not already, that is, nothing which may either in&s;truct or divert them, they are de&s;ir'd not to blame our diligence, and imagine them written for others who may receive &s;ome in&s;truction or diverti&s;ement thereby, and acknowledge them&s;elves oblig'd to us for our care.</P>
<P>For the getting of good and merchantable Tobacco, the fir&s;t thing to be done, is, in the proper &s;ea&s;on to prepare the beds in &s;everal places of the Gardens, &s;uch as have good &s;hel|ter from the winds; then they &s;ow in them the &s;eed which had been gather'd from the &s;talks of the precedent year, which they &s;uffer to grow and ripen for that purpo&s;e: They mix a&s;hes with the &s;eed when it is &s;own, that it may not fall too thick in &s;ome places: When it begins to appear above ground, it is carefully cover'd with the leaves of the prickly Palms, or with branches of Orange, or Citron-trees, to &s;ecure it from the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the Sun, the coolne&s;s of the night, and the &s;poil which tame Fowl and Birds might make in it.</P>
<P>While the Plant is growing up to a condition that it may be tran&s;planted, the place into which it is to be remov'd is pre|pared. If the Plantation be but newly e&s;tabli&s;h'd, it is requi|&s;ite that it &s;hould have been cleer'd of wood &s;ome con&s;iderable time before, and that the branches &s;hould be burnt upon the ground, and over the beds: And if after all that there be any thing remaining, whatever is not burnt mu&s;t be convey'd quite away, that the place may be free. True it is, there's no need of digging the earth of turning it up, nor yet of delv|ing, hut only of cleering it of all weeds, &s;o as that there re|main not any wood, nor bark, nor leaf, nor &s;o much as the lea&s;t gra&s;s. To do that, they make u&s;e of a kind of broad and &s;harp Hoes, which pare and take off the &s;urface of the ground,
<PB N="189" REF="108">
and if need be, carry along with them the roots of the weeds, who&s;e after-growth they would prevent.</P>
<P>The ground being thus prepar'd, it is divided into &s;everal ridges or beds di&s;tant one from the other two or three foot. To do this, they make u&s;e of long cords, which at the di&s;tance of every two foot, or thereabouts, are marked with a little piece of cloth, which is &s;ew'd thereto; and then they place little &s;ticks at all the places an&s;werable to tho&s;e marks; to the end, that when the time of tran&s;planting the young Tobacco is come, which is immediately after it hath pleas'd God to &s;end a good &s;hower of rain, they &s;hould have nothing el&s;e to do but to plant, and not lo&s;e time in making tho&s;e divi&s;ions of the Garden or Plantation.</P>
<P>The Tobacco-plant is ready for its removal out of the bed where it had been fir&s;t &s;own, when it hath four or five leaves &s;trong and thick enough, and about the bredth of a mans hand; for then, if it happen that the ground is &s;oftned by a plea&s;ant &s;hower of rain, all tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of having good Tobacco with the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on matter not much the incon|venience of being wet, &s;o they can but &s;et a good quantity of it in the ground. At that time there is an emulation among the good hu&s;bands, every one endeavouring to outvye the other in working: Some are employ'd in chu&s;ing and taking off the Plants from the beds, and di&s;po&s;ing them into ba&s;kets; others carry them to tho&s;e who&s;e work it is to plant them ex|actly at the places which had been before marked by the cord, as we &s;aid el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are employ'd about the planting of them make a hole in the ground with a &s;harp &s;tick, into which they &s;et the root of the Tobacco; then they thru&s;t the earth pretty hard about, yet &s;o as that the upper part of the Plant be not co|ver'd: And thus they do all along every rank, and a&s;&s;oon as they have fini&s;h'd one they begin another. Having performed that exerci&s;e, at the next meeting of the Neighbours together their common di&s;cour&s;e is, to enquire one of another how ma|ny thou&s;ands of Plants they have &s;et in the ground, and thence calculate the hopes of the future harve&s;t.</P>
<P>The Plant being thus &s;et in the ground, which is commonly done in &s;everal intervalls, in regard it &s;eldom happens that there is &s;o plentiful a fall of rain as that it might be done at once, or haply becau&s;e the ground is not all prepar'd at the &s;ame time, or that there are not Plants enough, is not there|upon neglected; on the contrary, this is but the beginning of the pains and care which the ordering of it requires; for the Planters mu&s;t be very careful to vi&s;it it often, and a&s;&s;oon as they have perceiv'd that it hath taken root, there mu&s;t be a &s;pecial care taken that the Caterpillars and other mi&s;chie|vous In&s;ects, whereof there are abundance in tho&s;e Countries, do not gnaw it, and hinder its growth.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="109">The next work is, at lea&s;t once every month, to weed away whatever might endanger the &s;mothering of it, diligently to grub up and rake the earth all about it, and to carry away the weeds to the extremities of the Plantation; for if they be left in the place where they are laid upon their being taken out of the ground, the lea&s;t rain would make them take root afre&s;h, and they would require a &s;econd weeding. The mo&s;t trouble&s;om herb of any, and that which cau&s;es mo&s;t trouble to get out of the Plantations, is Pur&s;lane, which in the&s;e parts of the world grows not without the pains and indu&s;try of Gardeners. This exerci&s;e is continu'd till &s;uch time as the Tobacco-plant hath cover'd all the adjacent ground, and that the &s;hade of it keeps down all other weeds.</P>
<P>But though all this be done, yet are not the Planters at re&s;t, ina&s;much as an&s;werably to the growth of the Plant in height and bredth, &s;ome mu&s;t be continually employ'd in cutting off the &s;uperfluous leaves, taking away tho&s;e that are dry'd up, rotten or decay'd, cleering it of all tho&s;e &s;hoots and &s;uckers which might hinder its coming to perfection, by diverting the &s;ap from the larger leaves: In fine, when the &s;talk is grown to a convenient height, it mu&s;t be check'd, by cutting off the top of every Plant, tho&s;e only excepted which are re&s;erv'd for &s;eed. After all this ordering, the Plant is to continue &s;ome weeks in the ground ere it comes to maturity, during which there is a little ce&s;&s;ation of labour and attendance about it.</P>
<P>But if the laborious Planter be exempted from the great pains he had be&s;tow'd about it, he &s;hall not want work; for there mu&s;t be a place prepar'd, where it is to be di&s;pos'd as &s;oon as it is ripe. Care mu&s;t be taken, that the Grange or Store-hou&s;e, where it ought to be dry'd to a certain medio|crity, be well cover'd and clo&s;e of all &s;ides; that it be furni&s;h'd with good &s;tore of poles fit for it to be laid upon; that provi|&s;ion be made of a certain thin bark taken from a tree called <HI>Mahot,</HI> to fa&s;ten every Plant to the poles; and that the place de&s;ign'd for the making of it up into rolls or pricks &s;hould have all things requi&s;ite for that work.</P>
<P>While all the&s;e preparations are made, if the Tobacco|leaves lo&s;e ever &s;o little of their fir&s;t verdure, and withal begin to bow down more then ordinary towards the ground, and if the &s;cent of them grows &s;tronger, it is a &s;ign that the Plant is come to maturity: And then, taking a very fair day, after the dew is fallen off, it is to be cut about an inch a|bove ground, and left upon the place till the evening, turning it once or twice, that the Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> may take away &s;omewhat of its moi&s;ture: In the evening it is carry'd by armfuls into the hou&s;e. It is fa&s;ten'd by the lower end of the &s;talk to the poles, &s;o that the leaves hang downwards: It is al&s;o requi&s;ite that they &s;hould not be laid too clo&s;e one to the other, le&s;t they
<PB N="191" REF="109" MS="y">
be corrupted, or be not dry enough, for want of air.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t cutting down of the Tobacco being over, they often vi&s;it the Plants which are hung up a drying, while the re&s;t which had been left growing comes to ripene&s;s; and when they find the leaves fit to be made up into rolls, that is, when they are neither too dry (for in that ca&s;e they would not be able to endure the wheel), nor yet too moi&s;t (for then they would corrupt in a &s;hort time), they are taken off the poles, they are laid in heaps at the end of the Grange, and every &s;talk is &s;tript of its leaves, after this manner.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, they lay a&s;ide all the longe&s;t and all the broade&s;t leaves, and they take away the great &s;talk which runs through the mid&s;t of them; the le&s;&s;er leaves are al&s;o laid by them&s;elves, to be di&s;pos'd within the roll, and the greater &s;erve for coverings and &s;hrowds for them. The&s;e leaves thus di&s;pos'd are ranked on planks or tables, clo&s;e by him who is to make them up into rolls, which he makes big|ger or &s;maller, as may be &s;een by tho&s;e brought over into the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>There is a certain art in making up the rolls, and tho&s;e who can do it with expedition and dexterity are highly e&s;teem'd, and get much more then tho&s;e who are employ'd about order|ing the ground: They mu&s;t have their hands and arms ex|tremely &s;upple and nimble, to make the wheel turn with &s;uch &s;peed, and &s;till to ob&s;erve the &s;ame proportion, that &s;o the roll may be equally big in all parts.</P>
<P>There is a particular artifice, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Tobacco, to di&s;po&s;e and lay it after the winding &s;o as that it may be the more ea&s;ily put up on the &s;ticks, which are all to be of a cer|tain bigne&s;s and length, to avoid deceit.</P>
<P>When the Tobacco is thus made up, it is convey'd to the Store-hou&s;e, and cover'd with <HI>Bananas</HI> or &s;ome other leaves, that it may not be prejudic'd by taking wind, and be of a good fair colour. That which cuts &s;omewhat unctuou&s;ly, is black|i&s;h and &s;hining, and hath a plea&s;ant and &s;trong &s;cent, and burns ea&s;ily in the Pipe, is accounted the be&s;t.</P>
<P>We told you, that the Tobacco-plant was cut almo&s;t even with the ground, and not pluck'd up by the roots; and it is purpo&s;ely &s;o cut, that it may &s;hoot forth new &s;talks: And in|deed it produces a &s;econd Plant, but &s;uch as is neither &s;o &s;trong nor &s;o fair as the former; nor is the Tobacco made thereof &s;o much e&s;teem'd, nor will keep &s;o well: It is call'd by &s;ome Shoot-Tobacco, or Sucker-Tobacco, or Tobacco of the &s;econd cutting or growth: Nay &s;ome will have three &s;hoots from the &s;ame &s;talk; and that humour hath brought the Tobacco which comes from &s;ome I&s;lands into di&s;-e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince we have expre&s;s'd our &s;elves &s;o much at large concerning the manufacture of Tobacco, we &s;hall not think

it improper to in&s;ert in this place what is practis'd by &s;ome cu|rious per&s;ons, whereby it is made more excellent then that which commonly goes under the name of <HI>Virinus-Tobacco,</HI> keeps well, and hath a &s;cent which fortifies the brain. After they have &s;et a&s;ide the Plants of the fir&s;t cutting, and while they are drying on the poles, they gather together all the ca&s;t leaves, the &s;mall &s;hoots, as al&s;o the filaments which are taken out of the mid&s;t of the leaves which have been already cleer'd; and after they have pounded them in a mortar, all is put into a bag, which is put into a pre&s;s to force out the juice, which is afterwards boil'd over a &s;oft fire till it be reduc'd to the con|&s;i&s;tency of a Syrup: That done, there is put into that decocti|on a little <HI>Copal,</HI> which is an aromatick gum, the virtue where|of is to fortifie the brain. This gum di&s;tills from a tree of the &s;ame name, which is common in the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and in the I&s;lands about the gulf of <HI>Hondures.</HI></P>
<P>After this drug is put into the compo&s;ition afore&s;aid, it mu&s;t be well &s;tirr'd, that its &s;weet &s;cent and other qualities may be communicated and diffus'd through the whole decoction: Then it mu&s;t be taken off the fire, and when it is cold it is &s;et in a ve&s;&s;el neer the per&s;on who makes up the roll of To|bacco, and as often as he takes a handful of the leaves to feed the roll, he mu&s;t wet his hand in that liquor, and wipe it with the leaves. This &s;ecret hath an admirable effect to make the Tobacco keep well, and derives to it a virtue which extremely heightens its price.</P>
<P>The Tobacco thus order'd is to be made up into a roll, at lea&s;t as big as a mans thumb, and be afterwards divided into little rolls not weighing above ten pound at the mo&s;t, and then &s;ent in little ve&s;&s;els or clo&s;e ba&s;kets made for that purpo&s;e, to keep it the better.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the manner how Sugar is made; and of the prepara|tion of Ginger, Indico, and Cotton.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the great plenty of Tobacco made at S. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers</HI> and the other I&s;lands had brought down the price of it &s;o low, that it did not turn to accompt, it pleas'd God to put it into the heart of the <HI>French</HI> General <HI>de Poincy,</HI> to find out &s;ome other ways to facilitate the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Inhabitants, and carry on &s;ome Trade: He thereupon em|ploy'd his Servants and Slaves about the culture of Sugar-Canes, Ginger, and Indico; and the de&s;ign met with a &s;ucce&s;s beyond what was expected.</P>
<P>Though it may be granted, that the Plant of the Sugar-Cane was known to the Ancients, yet is the invention of ma|king the Sugar but of late years: The Ancients knew no more of it then they did of <HI>Sena, Ca&s;&s;ia, Ambergreece, Musk, Civet,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin:</HI> They made no other u&s;e of this precious Reed, then in order to drink and Phy&s;ick. And therefore we may well oppo&s;e all the&s;e things, with much advantage, as al&s;o our Clocks, the Sea-Compa&s;s, the Art of Navigation, Pro&s;pective-gla&s;&s;es, Printing. Artillery, and &s;everal other ex|cellent Inventions of the la&s;t Ages, again&s;t their right way of dying Purple, their malleable Gla&s;s, the &s;ubtle Machines of their <HI>Archimedes,</HI> and &s;ome &s;uch like.</P>
<P>Having in the precedent Book given a de&s;cription of the Sugar-Cane, our bu&s;ine&s;s here will only be to repre&s;ent the manner how Sugar is gotten out of it.</P>
<P>That work is performed by a Machine or Mill, which &s;ome call an <HI>Ingenio,</HI> whereby the juice within the Canes is &s;queez'd out. The&s;e Mills are built of very &s;olid and la&s;ting wood, and are more convenient in the&s;e I&s;lands then tho&s;e u&s;ed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e at <HI>Madera</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il:</HI> Nor is it to be fear'd in the former, as many times in the latter, that the fire &s;hould get to the boiling Coppers, and &s;et all into a flame, to the de|&s;truction of tho&s;e who are employ'd about the work; for the Coppers in the&s;e I&s;lands are &s;een to boil, yet the fire that cau&s;es it is made and kept in on the out&s;ide by furnaces, which are &s;o well cemented, that neither the flame nor the &s;moak does any way hinder tho&s;e who are at work, which they may follow without any fear of danger or inconvenience.</P>
<P>The ordinary way of turning the Mills is by Hor&s;es or Oxen; but the <HI>French</HI> Governour hath one which is turn'd by water, which falling on a wheel &s;ets the whole Machine going.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="111" MS="y">When the Sugar-Canes are ripe, they are cut &s;omewhat neer the ground, above the fir&s;t knot which is without any juice; and having cut off the tops, and taken away certain little, long, and very thin leaves, which encompa&s;s them; they are made up into bundles, and carry'd to the Mills to be there pre&s;s'd and &s;queez'd between two rollers, turning one upon the other.</P>
<P>The juice which is &s;queez'd out of them falls into a great Ci&s;tern, whence it is convey'd through long pipes or channels into the ve&s;&s;els appointed for the boiling of it. In great Su|gar-works there are at lea&s;t &s;ix Coppers, whereof three very large ones are of copper, about the bredth and depth of tho&s;e us'd by Dyers, and are to clarifie the juice, which is to be boil'd with a gentle fire, putting in ever and anon a &s;mall quantity of a certain very &s;trong Lye, made of water and a&s;h|es, commonly call'd <HI>Temper,</HI> which makes all the filth to boil up, which as it appears is taken off with a great bra&s;s &s;kim|mer. When the juice is well purify'd in the&s;e three Coppers, into which it had been convey'd alternately one after another, it is &s;train'd through a cloth, and afterwards pour'd into three other Coppers of &s;ome other mettal, which are very thick, broad enough, and about a foot and a half deep. In the&s;e Coppers the Sugar receives its la&s;t boiling; for then there is a more violent fire made, and it is continually &s;tirr'd, and when it bubbles up &s;o as that it may be fear'd it &s;hould boil over the Coppers, it is allay'd by the ca&s;ting in of a little &s;allet-oil; and as it begins to grow thick, it is pour'd into the la&s;t of tho&s;e Coppers, from whence, as it inclines to a con&s;i&s;tency, it is di&s;|pos'd into ve&s;&s;els of wood or earth, and &s;o carry'd into the Curing-hou&s;e, where it is whiten'd with a kind of fat earth mixt with water, which is &s;pred upon it; then they open the little hole in the bottom of every ve&s;&s;el or pot, that all the filth or dregs that is about the Sugar may fall into ano|ther channel, which conveys it into a ve&s;&s;el prepar'd for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;kimmings which had been taken off the great Coppers is laid a&s;ide only for Cattle, but the other &s;erves well enough to make a certain drink for the Servants and Slaves. The juice which is drawn from the Cane will conti|nue good but one day, in&s;omuch that if within that time it be not boil'd, it grows &s;harp and turns to vinegar. There mu&s;t al&s;o be a very great care taken, that the Re&s;ervatory into which the &s;queezed juice falls, and the pipes or channels whereby it is thence convey'd into other places, be often wa&s;h'd; for if they contract ever &s;o little &s;harpne&s;s, the juice cannot be reduc'd to Sugar: The whole work would al&s;o mi&s;carry, if any butter or oil chance to be ca&s;t into any of the three greater Coppers, which are to be wa&s;h'd with Lye; or
<PB N="196" REF="112" MS="y">
in like manner, if ever &s;o little Lye fall into the three le&s;&s;er ones, where the juice is form'd into a Syrup, and curdles by the violence of the fire, and the continual agitation and &s;tir|ring of it with a &s;kimmer. But above all things there mu&s;t be a great care taken, that there fall not any juice of Citron in|to the Coppers; for that would ab&s;olutely hinder the coagula|tion of the Sugar.</P>
<P>Many of the Inhabitants who are not able to get &s;o many Coppers, nor furni&s;h them&s;elves with tho&s;e great Engines whereby the Canes are &s;queez'd, have little Mills made like Pre&s;&s;es, which are wrought by two or three men, or driven about by one hor&s;e; and with one or two Coppers they purifie the juice gotten out of them, reduce it to the con&s;i|&s;tence of Syrup, and make good Sugar without any further trouble.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t &s;ecret in the bu&s;ine&s;s of making good Sugar con&s;i&s;ts in the whitening of it: Tho&s;e who have it are very loth to communicate it. From what hath been &s;aid, it may be ea&s;ily inferr'd what extraordinary advantages accrue to the Inhabitants of that I&s;land by means of this &s;weet and precious Commodity, and what &s;atisfaction it brings to their Corre|&s;pondents in other parts of the world, who have it at &s;o ea&s;ie rates.</P>
<P>This plenty of Sugar hath put the Inhabitants upon the pre|&s;erving of abundance of excellent fruits of the growth of the I&s;land, as Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and others, e&s;pecially Ginger, whereof we &s;hall give an account anon, and the fruit call'd <HI>Ananas,</HI> and the flowers of Oranges and Citrons.</P>
<P>As concerning the preparation of Ginger, when the root is come to maturity it is taken out of the ground; then it is dry'd in places well air'd, and it is often &s;tirr'd to prevent corruption. Some make no more ado then to expo&s;e it to the Sun in order to the drying of it; but others think it re|qui&s;ite to ca&s;t lime on it, the more to facilitate the drawing a|way of the moi&s;ture. This root, which is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among Spices, is tran&s;ported all over the world; but it is mo&s;t &s;ought after in cold Countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> do &s;ometimes take it out of the ground be|fore it is fully ripe, and pre&s;erve it whole with &s;uch arti|fice, that it becomes red, and tran&s;parent as gla&s;s. The pre|&s;erv'd Ginger which is brought over from <HI>Brazil</HI> and the <HI>Le|vant</HI> is commonly dry, full of filaments or little &s;trings, and too biting to be eaten with any delight; but that which is prepar'd at S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> hath no fibres or &s;trings at all, and it is &s;o well order'd, that there remains nothing that is unplea|&s;ant to the tooth when it is eaten.</P>
<P>It hath a &s;ingular property to fortifie the brea&s;t, when it is weakned by a confluence of cold humours; as al&s;o to
<PB N="197" REF="112" MS="y">
clear the voice, to &s;weeten the breath, to cau&s;e a good co|lour in the face, to take away the crudities of the &s;tomach, to promote dige&s;tion, to &s;harpen the appetite, and to con|&s;ume that wateri&s;hne&s;s and phlegm which puts the body in|to a langui&s;hing condition; nay it is affirm'd by &s;ome, that it pre&s;erves and wonderfully fortifies the memory, by di&s;|per&s;ing the cold humours, or the phlegm of the Brain. This root may al&s;o be reduc'd into a pa&s;te, of which there may be made a Con&s;erve, or cordial Electuary that hath the &s;ame ef|fects.</P>
<P>We come now to give a &s;hort account of Indico. The Plant being cut is bound up into little bundles or fagots, and left to rot in ci&s;terns of &s;tone or wood full of fair water, on which there is ca&s;t a certain quantity of oil, which according to its nature covers all the &s;urface of it: They lay &s;tones upon the fagots, that they may the better keep under the water; and after three or four days that the water hath been boiling, which it does by the meer virtue of the Plant, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fire, the leaf being rotted and di&s;&s;olv'd by that natural heat which is in the &s;talk, they take great &s;takes and &s;tir the whole ma&s;s that is within the ci&s;terns, &s;o to get out all the &s;ub&s;tance of it; and after it is &s;etled again, they take out of the ci&s;tern that part of the &s;talk which is not rotted: that done, they &s;everal times &s;tir what is left in the ci&s;tern, and af|ter they have left it to &s;etle, they let out the water at a cock; and the lees or dregs which remains at the bottom of the ci&s;tern, is put into molds, or left to dry in the Sun. The&s;e dregs is that which is &s;o much e&s;teem'd by Dyers, and commonly known by the name of Indico.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome make u&s;e of Pre&s;&s;es, whereinto having put little bundles of the rotted Plant, they by that means get out all the juice of it: But in regard they are the leaves of the Plant that the fore&s;aid Commodity is made of, tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to have it of the highe&s;t price, think it enough to have the dregs which remains after the corruption of tho&s;e leaves, and is found, after &s;o many &s;tirrings, at the bottom of the ci|&s;tern.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> were there a long time ere they drove any trade in that Commodity, by rea&s;on that the Plant whereof it is made, being of it &s;elf of a very &s;trong &s;cent, exhales an in&s;upportable &s;tink when it is rot|ted: But &s;ince Tobacco came to &s;o low a rate, and that in &s;ome places the ground would not bring forth that which was good, as it had done &s;ome time before, they apply'd them&s;elves to the culture of Indico, whereof they now make a con&s;iderable advantage.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, as concerning Cotton, the <HI>French</HI> make it not much their bu&s;ine&s;s to gather it, though they have many of the trees
<PB N="198" REF="113">
that bear it in the hedges of their Plantations: But all put to|gether amounts but to little in compari&s;on of what is &s;aid of a certain Quarter of the Province of <HI>China;</HI> for a certain Au|thour named <HI>Trigaut,</HI> in the xvii. chap. of the fifth Book of his Hi&s;tory, affirms, that there grows &s;o much Cotton there as finds work enough for two hundred thou&s;and Weavers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who are the Inhabitants of the <HI>Barbouthos</HI> drive a great trade in this Commodity, as al&s;o tho&s;e who liv'd formerly in the I&s;land of <HI>Santa-cruce.</HI> There is no great trou|ble in the making of Cotton fit for the market; for all to be done, is to get out of the half-open'd button that matter which in a manner forces its way out it &s;elf: And whereas it is full of the &s;eed of the tree that bears it, which are like little beans intangled within the Cotton, in the mid&s;t where|of they had their production, there are a &s;ort of little En|gines made with &s;uch artifice, that by the turning of a wheel, whereby they are put into motion, the Cotton falls on the one &s;ide, and the &s;eed on the other: That done, the Cotton is thru&s;t up as clo&s;e as may be into bags, that &s;o it may take up the le&s;s room.</P>
<P>Thus have we given a brief account of the principal Em|ployments which keep up the Commerce of the I&s;lands, and the Commodities wherein the Inhabitants do ordinarily trade.</P>

<P>As concerning the Slaves, and &s;uch as are to be perpetual Servants, who are commonly employ'd in the&s;e I&s;lands, they are originally <HI>Africans,</HI> and they are brought over thither from the Country about <HI>Cap-vert,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Angolae,</HI> and other Sea-ports which are on the Coa&s;ts of that part of the world; where they are bought and &s;old after the &s;ame manner as Cattle in other places.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, &s;ome are reduc'd to a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling them|&s;elves, and entring into a perpetual &s;lavery, they and their children, to avoid &s;tarving; for in the years of &s;terility, which happen very frequently, e&s;pecially when the Gra&s;s|hoppers, which like clouds &s;pread them&s;elves over the whole Country, have con&s;um'd all the fruits of the earth, they are brought to &s;uch a remedile&s;s extremity, that they will &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t rigorous conditions in the world, provided they may be kept from &s;tarving. When they are reduc'd to tho&s;e exigencies, the Father makes no difficulty to &s;ell his children for bread; and the children for&s;ake Father and Mother with|out any regret.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="114" MS="y">Another &s;ort of them are &s;old after they have been taken Pri&s;oners in War by &s;ome petty neighbouring Prince; for it is the cu&s;tom of the Princes of tho&s;e Parts to make frequent in|cur&s;ions into the Territories of their Neighbours, purpo&s;ely for the taking of Pri&s;oners, whom they afterwards &s;ell to the <HI>Portuguez,</HI> and other Nations with whom they drive that bar|barous Trade: They receive in exchange for them Iron (which is as precious with them as Gold), Wine, <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> Brandy, or &s;ome poor Clothing: They make Slaves of the women as well as the men, and they are &s;old one with another, at a higher or lower rate, according to their youth, age, &s;trength, or weakne&s;s, hand&s;omne&s;s, or deformity of body. They who bring them over to the I&s;lands make a &s;econd &s;ale of them, at fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred weight of Tobacco every head, more or le&s;s, as the parties concern'd can agree.</P>
<P>If the&s;e poor Slaves chance to fall into the hands of a good Ma&s;ter, one who will not treat them with too much &s;everity, they prefer their pre&s;ent &s;lavery before their former liberty, the lo&s;s whereof they never afterwards regret: And if they are permitted to marry, they multiply extremely in tho&s;e hot Countries.</P>
<P>They are all Negroes, and tho&s;e who are of the brighte&s;t black are accounted the faire&s;t: Mo&s;t of them are flat-nos'd, and have thick lips, which goes among them for beauty; nay there are &s;ome affirm, that in their Country the Midwives do purpo&s;ely cru&s;h down their no&s;es, that they may be flat, a&s;&s;oon as they come into the world: The hair of their heads is all frizl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, &s;o that they can hardly make u&s;e of Combs; but to prevent the breeding of vermine, they rub their heads with the oil of that &s;hrub which is called <HI>Palma-Christi:</HI> They are very &s;trong and hardy, but withal &s;o fearful and unwieldy in the handling of Arms, that they are ea&s;ily reduc'd under &s;ub|jection.</P>
<P>They are naturally &s;u&s;ceptible of all impre&s;&s;ions, and the fir&s;t that are deriv'd into them among the Chri&s;tians, after they have renounc'd their Super&s;titions and Idolatry, they pertina|ciou&s;ly adhere unto; wherein they differ much from the <HI>In|dians</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> who are as uncon&s;tant as Cameleons. Among the <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> there are &s;ome Negroes who punctually ob&s;erve ab&s;tinence all the time of Lent, and all the other Fa&s;ting-days appointed by the Church, without any remi&s;&s;ion of their ordinary and continual labour.</P>
<P>They are commonly proud and in&s;olent; and whereas the <HI>Indians</HI> are de&s;irous to be gently treated, and are apt to dye out of pure grief, if they be put to more then ordinary hard|&s;hip, the&s;e on the contrary are to be kept in awe by threats and blows; for if a man grow too familiar with them, they are pre&s;ently apt to make their advantages of it, and to abu&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="115">
that familiarity; but if they be cha&s;tiz'd with moderation when they have done ami&s;s, they become better, more &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive, and more compliant, nay will commend and think the bet|ter of their Ma&s;ters: But on the other &s;ide, if they be treated with exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity, they will run away, and get into the Mountains and Fore&s;ts, where they live like &s;o many Bea&s;ts; then they are call'd <HI>Marons,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Savages: or haply they will grow &s;o de&s;perate as to be their own Executioners. It is therefore requi&s;ite, that in the conduct of them there &s;hould be a mean ob&s;erv'd between extream &s;everity and too much indulgence, by tho&s;e who would keep them in awe, and make the be&s;t advantage of them.</P>
<P>They are pa&s;&s;ionate Lovers one of another; and though they are born in different Countries, and &s;ometimes, when at home, Enemies one to another, yet when occa&s;ion requires they mutually &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, as if they were all Brethren: And when their Ma&s;ters give them the liberty to recreate them&s;elves, they reciprocally vi&s;it one the other, and pa&s;s away whole nights in playing, dancing, and other pa&s;times and diverti&s;ments; nay, &s;ometimes they have &s;ome little Enter|tainments, every one &s;paring what he can to contribute to the common repa&s;t.</P>
<P>They are great Lovers of Mu&s;ick, and much pleas'd with &s;uch In&s;truments as make a certain delightful noi&s;e, and a kind of harmony, which they accompany with their voices. They had heretofore in the I&s;land of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> a certain Ren|dezvouz in the mid&s;t of the Woods, where they met on Sun|days and Holidays after Divine Service, to give &s;ome relaxati|on to their wearied bodies: There they &s;ometimes &s;pent the remainder of that day, and the night following, in dancing and plea&s;ant di&s;cour&s;es, without any prejudice to the ordinary la|bours impos'd upon them by their Ma&s;ters: nay, it was com|monly ob&s;erv'd, that after they had &s;o diverted them&s;elves, they went through their work with greater courage and chearful|ne&s;s, without expre&s;&s;ing any wearine&s;s, and did all things bet|ter than if they had re&s;ted all night long in their huts. But it being found, that the better to enjoy them&s;elves in the&s;e pub|lick Meetings, they many times &s;tole the Poultry and Fruits of their Neighbours, and &s;ometimes tho&s;e of their Ma&s;ters, the <HI>French</HI> General thought fit to forbid the&s;e nocturnal a&s;&s;em|blies: So that now if they are de&s;irous to divert them&s;elves, they are enjoyn'd to do it within their own Neighbourhoods, with the permi&s;&s;ion of their Ma&s;ters, who are willing enough to allow them convenient liberty.</P>
<P>As to the Advantages accrewing from the labours of the&s;e Slaves, he who is Ma&s;ter of a dozen of them may be account|ed a rich man: For be&s;ides that the&s;e are the People who cul|tivate the ground in order to its production of all nece&s;&s;ary

Add to this, that their &s;ervice being perpetual, their number in|crea&s;es from time to time by the Children that are born of them, which have no other Inheritance than that of the &s;la|very and &s;ubjection of their Parents.</P>
<P>All the Forreign Inhabitants who have planted them&s;elves in tho&s;e I&s;lands are govern'd according to the Laws and Cu&s;toms of their own Countries.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants of S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> Ju&s;tice is ad|mini&s;tred by a Council con&s;i&s;ting of the principal Officers who have the over&s;ight of the Militia of the I&s;land, of which Coun|cil the General is Pre&s;ident: And though there are certain places appointed for that Admini&s;tration, yet is the Council many times a&s;&s;embled as the General thinks fit, and occa&s;ion requires, under a kind of great Fig-tree, which is about the bigne&s;s of a large Elm, neer the Court of Guard of the <HI>Ba&s;se|terre,</HI> not far from the Haven.</P>
<P>In this Council, abating all the Formalities which have been invented to make Suits immortal, all differences that happen between the Inhabitants are amicably compos'd, and decided mo&s;t commonly at the fir&s;t &s;itting, without any charge to the Parties, &s;ave only that he which is found guilty of the wrong is to make &s;atisfaction according to the Cu&s;tom, whereof part goes to the relief of the Poor, and maintenance of the Church, and the re&s;t for the &s;atisfaction of the party concern'd. This Council doth al&s;o pa&s;s &s;entence of death, without appeal to any other Power.</P>
<P>The Governours of the other I&s;lands do al&s;o admini&s;ter Ju|&s;tice every one in his Government: So that no man &s;hould be guilty of &s;o great a weakne&s;s as to imagine that people live in tho&s;e Countries without any order or rule, as many do: Nay, it is rather to be look'd on as a kind of Miracle, that (the Inha|bitants of tho&s;e Countries being a confluence of people from &s;o many &s;everal Countries, and con&s;equently of different hu|mors and con&s;titutions) di&s;orders &s;hould not creep in, and that all are kept in awe and &s;ubjection to the Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<PB N="204" REF="116">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Origine of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> the natural Inhabitants of the Country.</HEAD>
<P>THe Method we had propos'd to our &s;elves for the profe|cution of this Hi&s;tory requires that henceforth we treat of the <HI>Indians,</HI> the natural Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies.</HI> And here we conceive it not to be our bu&s;ine&s;s to bring upon the Stage that great and difficult Que&s;tion, to wit, How the race of Men came to &s;pread it &s;elf into <HI>America,</HI> and whence they came into that new World? There are &s;ome eminent Per&s;ons have treated of this matter with &s;o much &s;ufficiency, exactne&s;s, and &s;olidity, that it were a tedious and &s;uperfluous Work at the pre&s;ent to trouble the Reader with any thing concerning it. Be&s;ides, the Hi&s;tory of the Originals of our Savage Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> requires not that we &s;hould de&s;cend &s;o low to find them.</P>
<P>The ancient and natural Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> are tho&s;e who have been called by &s;ome Authors <HI>Cannibals, Anthro|pophagi,</HI> or <HI>Eaters of Men;</HI> but mo&s;t others who have written of them, commonly call them <HI>Caribbians</HI> or <HI>Caribes:</HI> But their primitive and originary Name, and that which is pronounc'd with mo&s;t gravity is, as the <HI>French</HI> Writers would have it, that of <HI>Cara&iuml;bes:</HI> Nay, if we may credit the&s;e la&s;t mentioned Au|thors, not only the <HI>Caribbians</HI> them&s;elves of the I&s;lands do &s;o pronounce their name, but al&s;o tho&s;e of their Nation who live in the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> both the Septentrional and Meri|dional: So that that being the mo&s;t common appellation of them among the <HI>French</HI> Inhabitants of the I&s;lands, we &s;hall al|&s;o have occa&s;ion to u&s;e it &s;ometimes in the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory, in regard the pre&s;ent Work is render'd out of that Language.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that this word <HI>Caraibes</HI> (or <HI>Caribbians</HI>) is not natural to the &s;avage Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> but that it was impos'd upon them by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as they had given the &s;ame denomination to many Savages of the Meridi|onal Continent, who are known thereby; as al&s;o that of <HI>Calibis,</HI> or <HI>Calibites,</HI> to their allies the Inhabitants of the &s;ame Continent.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who maintain this opinion affirm, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might well give to tho&s;e People that name of <HI>Caraibes,</HI> in regard they over-ran all the Quarters of the Southerly part of <HI>Ameri|ca;</HI> and that having made the fir&s;t Maps thereof, they &s;et down tho&s;e Nations under that Name, which hath &s;tuck to them ever &s;ince. To prove this they alledge, that they are never call'd <HI>Caraibes</HI> or <HI>Caribbians</HI> among them&s;elves, but only when they are drunk, and that having their heads full of Wine they
<PB N="205" REF="116">
leap up and down and rejoyce, &s;aying in their corrupt Lan|guage, <HI>Moy bonne Caraibe, I am an hone&s;t Caribbian:</HI> That otherwi&s;e they only make u&s;e of that word when they are among&s;t Strangers, and that in their trading and their commu|nication with them, to make a certain di&s;covery of them&s;elves, as being &s;en&s;ible that the &s;aid name is known to them: But that when they are among them&s;elves, not only they, but al&s;o tho&s;e of their Nation Inhabiting the Continent, and the <HI>Calibites,</HI> call them&s;elves by the name of <HI>Calinago,</HI> which is the name of the Men, and <HI>Calliponan,</HI> which is that of the Women. And they further affirm, that they are called <HI>Oubao-bonon,</HI> that is, <HI>In|habitants of the I&s;lands,</HI> or <HI>I&s;landers;</HI> as the call tho&s;e of the Continent <HI>Bato&uuml;e-bonon,</HI> that is, <HI>Inhabitants of the Firm Land.</HI></P>
<P>But all this pre&s;uppos'd as probable, there is but little likeli|hood that the word <HI>Caribbians</HI> &s;hould have been impos'd upon them by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that our I&s;lands &s;hould not have had it before they were known by them. The fir&s;t rea&s;on we give of this a&s;&s;ertion is, that before either the <HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Portu|guez</HI> had found a pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Brazil,</HI> there were in tho&s;e Parts certain men more &s;ubtle and ingenious then the re&s;t, whom the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> call'd <HI>Caraibes,</HI> or <HI>Caribbians,</HI> as <HI>Johannes de Lery</HI> hath ob&s;erv'd in his Hi&s;tory. Secondly, it is a thing out of all con|trover&s;ie that there are certain Savages who bear the name of <HI>Caribbians</HI> in &s;ome Quarters of the Southerly part of <HI>America,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> never had any Commerce: For not only tho&s;e of the &s;ame Nation with our I&s;landers, who inhabit along tho&s;e Coa&s;ts of the Meridional <HI>America,</HI> and are neer Neigh|bours to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Colonies of <HI>Cayenna</HI> and <HI>Berbica,</HI> but tho&s;e al&s;o who live far within that Meridional Continent, beyond the &s;ources of the mo&s;t remarkable Rivers, call them&s;elves <HI>Caribbi|ans.</HI> Moreover, we &s;hall find in the &s;equel of this Chapter, that there is in the Septentrional Continent a powerful Nation con&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t part of certain Families, who at this pre&s;ent take a great pride in being called <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and &s;tand upon it, that they had receiv'd that name long before <HI>America</HI> was di&s;cover'd. Add to this, that though it were granted that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have impos'd that name on all tho&s;e Nati|ons, how can it be prov'd that they were as willing to accept of it from People unknown and Enemies to them? Now it is cer|tain, that not only all tho&s;e people do call them&s;elves <HI>Caribbi|ans,</HI> but al&s;o that they withal think it a glory, and derive an advantage from that name, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Montel</HI> hath heard it from their own mouths: How then is it to be imagin'd that they &s;hould triumph in a name which they had receiv'd from their Enemies? Nay if it be urg'd further, as we &s;hall &s;ee anon, that the Ance&s;tors of our Savage Inhabitants of the I&s;lands receiv'd from the <HI>Apalachites</HI> the name of <HI>Caribbians,</HI> in&s;tead of that of <HI>Cofachites,</HI> under which they went before; it may be replyed,
<PB N="206" REF="117">
That they took it from &s;uch as were their friends and confede|rates, and that as an Elogy of honour. In fine, we al&s;o af|firm, that it is not only in their drunkenne&s;s and debauches, that our <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants of the I&s;lands call them&s;elves <HI>Carib|bians,</HI> but they do it al&s;o when they are &s;ober and in cold blood; And as to their calling them&s;elves <HI>Calinago,</HI> it is po&s;|&s;ible they may have many different names, whence it does not ever the more follow, that they had received any of them from the <HI>Europaeans.</HI> For the denomination of <HI>Oubao-bonon;</HI> the &s;ignification of the word &s;ufficiently &s;hews, that it is not particular to them, and that it may be generally applyed to any Inhabitants of I&s;lands. And whereas they make u&s;e of the name of <HI>Caribbians</HI> rather than of any other, when they &s;peak to &s;trangers, it is becau&s;e they are apprehen&s;ive enough that that name is be&s;t known to them: but it is not to be conclu|ded thence, that they received it from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nay it might be more probably affirmed that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves having learnt it of them, &s;hould afterwards have communica|ted it to other <HI>Europaeans.</HI> But as to our de&s;ign, it matters not much whether opinion be embrac'd, and every one may fol|low which &s;entiment liketh him be&s;t; only we have taken the liberty to propo&s;e what we conceived mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>As to the originals of the in&s;ulary <HI>Caribbians,</HI> tho&s;e who have hitherto given any account of them, have had &s;o little light to guide them&s;elves by in that ob&s;cure piece of Antiqui|ty, that they may be &s;aid to have grop'd all their way: &s;ome imagine that they are de&s;cended from the <HI>Jews,</HI> grounding their conjecture, among other things, on this, that the <HI>Carib|bians</HI> are obliged to marry tho&s;e Kin&s;women of theirs that are next of kin to them, and that &s;ome among them eat no &s;wines fle&s;h nor Tortoi&s;es: But this is to fetch a thing too far off, and to ground an imagination on too weak conjectures. There are others who would have them to come over from the Haven of <HI>Caribana,</HI> and pretend that they were tran&s;ported thence: But this opinion is grounded only on the clinching of the words <HI>Caribana</HI> and <HI>Caribbians,</HI> without any other con|firmation.</P>
<P>There are yet others who affirm, and that upon a &s;imple conjecture, that the&s;e Savages are the originary Inhabitants of the greater I&s;lands, and that it is not long &s;ince they came into tho&s;e now called the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> where they took refuge as the remainders of the horrid Ma&s;&s;acres committed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of St. <HI>Domingo, Cu|ba, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Porto-Rico:</HI> But this is confuted by the cer|tainty of Hi&s;tory, which a&s;&s;ures us, that at the fir&s;t beginning of the di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Caribbies</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and inhabited by the <HI>Caribbians;</HI> that at fir&s;t they were &s;urprized and ill-entreated by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but that afterwards the&s;e
<PB N="207" REF="117">
la&s;t being beaten off with di&s;advantage, and meeting with ma|ny inconveniences in the pro&s;ecution of that war, made a kind of agreement with &s;ome among them, as we &s;hall &s;ee more particularly hereafter in the Chapter of their Wars. Add to this, that the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Cora&s;&s;ao,</HI> who, without all di&s;pute, are &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons who e&s;caped the Ma&s;&s;acres, and who have among them &s;ome yet living, who lived in the Port called at the pre&s;ent, the Port of the <HI>Kow-I&s;land,</HI> or as the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Le port de l' I&s;le &agrave; vache,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> when the fir&s;t <HI>Spaniards</HI> landed there, have not a word of the <HI>Ca|ribbian</HI> Language in theirs, nor any thing of Carriage; whence it may be deduc'd, that there never was any communication or corre&s;pondence between them and the <HI>Caribbians.</HI> Be&s;ides, tho&s;e of the greater I&s;lands who might have fled to avoid the tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> would have had greater encourage|ment to retreat into the Territories which were below them, and whereto the regular winds lay more fit to carry them, than to direct their cour&s;e again&s;t the wind, and &s;o retarding their flight, expo&s;e them&s;elves to a thou&s;and hazards by Sea, and engage them&s;elves in a voyage twenty times as long: For it is almo&s;t a miracle, that &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els as theirs are can advance a league in a day again&s;t the wind; nay it many times hap|pens that very great ve&s;&s;els are in their a&s;cent forc'd back more in three hours than they had advanc'd in &s;ix daies: For we have it from very skilful Pilots, that they have been three months getting up from the <HI>Cul-de-Sac</HI> of St. <HI>Domingo</HI> to St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers;</HI> whereas to fall down from St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> to St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> there needs commonly not above four or five days at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>As concerning the opinion the <HI>Caribbians</HI> them&s;elves have of their origine, we find, that, being as ignorant of all Monu|ments of Antiquity, as free from all curio&s;ity of enquiring af|ter things to come, they believe for the mo&s;t part, that they are de&s;cended from the <HI>Calibites</HI> or <HI>Calibis,</HI> their Allyes and great friends, the Inhabitants of the Meridional part of <HI>America,</HI> &amp; the neighbouring people of the <HI>Arouagues</HI> or <HI>Alouagues,</HI> in that Country or Province which is commonly called <HI>Guyana,</HI> or the <HI>Savage-Coa&s;t.</HI> And tho&s;e who adhere to this opinion, ground their per&s;wa&s;ion on the conformity of Language, Religion and Manners, ob&s;ervable between the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Inhabitants of the I&s;lands, and the <HI>Calibites;</HI> though it may as well be pre&s;um'd that the &s;aid re&s;emblance might partly proceed from the allyance and particular friend&s;hip there was between them; partly from the Neighbourhood of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Meridional Continent and tho&s;e <HI>Calibites;</HI> and partly from &s;ome other cau&s;es, whereof we &s;hall give an account here|after.</P>
<P>But the&s;e poor Savages of the I&s;lands agree not among
<PB N="208" REF="118">
them&s;elves in the particular relation they make of their Extra|ction, and the occa&s;ion that brought them into tho&s;e I&s;lands; nor can they give any account of the time of their coming thi|ther. We &s;hall here &s;et down what tho&s;e of S. <HI>Vincent</HI> and &s;ome others have related to Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Montel</HI> concerning them&s;elves, which we have taken out of his curious Collections.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Caribbians</HI> were heretofore &s;ubject to the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> and obey'd their Prince; but &s;ome among them not able to en|dure that yoke, broke out into a Rebellion: And that they might the better live undi&s;turb'd, and at a di&s;tance from their Enemies, they retreated to the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands, which were not at that time inhabited; and their fir&s;t landing was in the I&s;land of <HI>Tabago,</HI> which is one of the neere&s;t to the Continent: Afterwards the other <HI>Calibites</HI> &s;hook of the Domination of the <HI>Arouagues;</HI> but finding them&s;elves &s;trong enough, or not ha|ving the &s;ame inclination with the former, they continu'd in their Country; and what they had at the time of their revolt they have kept ever &s;ince, and live free in the Country, but Enemies to the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> having a Captain-General of their own Nation, by whom they are commanded. They have al&s;o continu'd to this pre&s;ent Friends and Confederates to the <HI>Ca|ribbians.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Relation it is that &s;ome ground the explication they make of the word <HI>Caribbians,</HI> as if it &s;ignified <HI>Rebells;</HI> whether it was impos'd upon them by the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> or that tho&s;e people a&s;&s;um'd it of them&s;elves by way of triumph, as deriving a certain glory from their noble In&s;urrection, and the generous Rebellion which e&s;tabli&s;h'd them in peace and liber|ty: But there needs no more to &s;hew that the word <HI>Caribbian</HI> does not &s;ignifie <HI>Rebel,</HI> as among others a certain Journal of a Dutch-man, than that there are many Colonies in &s;everal parts of the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> both the Septentrional and Me|ridional, which no body pretends or can pretend were ever un|der the power of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> which yet are known by the name of <HI>Caribbians.</HI> And as to the being among them any that have rebell'd again&s;t other Sovereigns, only this may be inferr'd thence, That being &s;ince reconcil'd to them, and living to this day in the mid&s;t of them, under the &s;aid name of <HI>Carib|bians,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;ee more particularly anon, there is no like|lihood that it &s;hould &s;ignifie <HI>Rebels,</HI> &s;ince it were a bla&s;ting of their Reputation, and a mark of Infamy to them.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who have convers'd a long time together among the Savages of <HI>Dominico</HI> relate, that the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Inhabitants of that I&s;land are of opinion, that their Ance&s;tors came out of the Continent, from among the <HI>Calibites,</HI> to make a War again&s;t a Nation of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> which inhabited the I&s;lands, which Nation they utterly de&s;troy'd, excepting only the Wo|men, whom they took to them&s;elves, and by that means re|peopled

<P><PB N="210" REF="119">The <HI>Caribbians</HI> were originary Inhabitants of the Septentri|onal part of <HI>America,</HI> of that Country which is now called <HI>Flo|rida:</HI> They came to Inhabit the I&s;lands after they had departed from amid&s;t the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> among whom they lived a long time; and they left there &s;ome of their people, who to this day go under the name of <HI>Caribbians:</HI> But their fir&s;t origine is from the <HI>Cofachites,</HI> who only chang'd their denomination, and were called <HI>Caribbians</HI> in the Country of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;ee anon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apalachites</HI> are a powerful and generous Nation, which continues to this pre&s;ent planted in the &s;ame Country of <HI>Flo|rida:</HI> They are the Inhabitants of a gallant and &s;pacious Country called <HI>Apalacha,</HI> from which they have received their name, and which begins at the altitude of thirty three de|grees and twenty five minutes, North of the Equinoctial Line, and reaches to the thirty &s;eventh degree. This people have a communication with the Sea of the great Gulf of <HI>Mexico</HI> or <HI>New Spain,</HI> by the means of a River, which taking its &s;ource out of the <HI>Apalachaean</HI> Mountains, at the foot whereof they inhabit, after it hath wandred through many rich Campagnes, di&s;embogues it &s;elf at la&s;t into the Sea neer the I&s;lands of <HI>Ta|cobago:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have called this River <HI>Riu del Spirito Santo;</HI> but the <HI>Apalachites</HI> call it &s;till by its ancient name of <HI>Hitanachi,</HI> which in their Language &s;ignifies fair and plea&s;ant. On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide they are divided from all other Nations by high and far-&s;preading Mountains, who&s;e tops are cover'd with &s;now mo&s;t part of the year, and which &s;eparate them from <HI>Vir|ginia:</HI> on the other &s;ides they abjoin to &s;everal incon&s;iderable Nations, which are all their friends and confederates.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Apalachites</HI> make it their boa&s;t, that they had propa|gated certain Colonies a great way into <HI>Mexico:</HI> And they &s;how to this day a great Road by land, by which they affirm that their Forces march'd into tho&s;e parts. The Inhabitants of the Country, upon their arrival gave them the name of <HI>Tlatuici,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Mountaineers</HI> or <HI>High-Landers,</HI> for they were more hardy and more generous than they. They planted them&s;elves in a quarter like that from which they came, &s;cituate at the foot of the Mountains, in a fertile &s;oil, where they built a City, as neer as they could like that which they had left behind them, whereof they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd to this day. They are &s;o united there by inter-marriages and other bonds of peace, that they make up but one people with them; nor indeed could they well be di&s;cern'd one from the other, if they had not retain'd &s;everal words of their originary language, which is the only ob&s;ervable difference between them.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Apalachites</HI> had planted this Colony, the <HI>Cofachites,</HI> who liv'd more towards the north of <HI>America,</HI> in a fenny and

&s;omewhat barren Country, and who had continu'd till then in good corre&s;pondence with them, knowing that they were then far from their be&s;t and mo&s;t valiant men, took an advan|tageous opportunity to fall upon their Neighbours the <HI>Apala|chites,</HI> and to force them out of their habitations, or at lea&s;t to participate with them of the land where they had &s;etled them&s;elves, after they &s;hould become Ma&s;ters thereof. This de&s;ign having been carried on very cunningly among the chief|e&s;t of the <HI>Cofachites,</HI> they afterwards publi&s;h'd it in all their Villages, and got it approv'd by all the heads of Families, who in&s;tead of minding the bu&s;ine&s;s of Husbandry and &s;etting things in order for the &s;owing of Corn at the beginning of the Spring, as they were wont to do other years, prepar'd their Bows, Ar|rows, and Clubs; and having &s;et their habitations on fire, and furni&s;h'd them&s;elves with &s;ome little provi&s;ions out of what was left of the precedent Winter, they took the field, with their wives and children, and all the little baggage they had, with a re&s;olution either to conquer or dye, &s;ince they had cut off all hopes of returning to a place which they had de&s;troy'd and de&s;poil'd of all manner of conveniences.</P>
<P>In this equipage they in a &s;hort time got to the frontiers of their Neighbours: The <HI>Apalachites</HI> who thought of nothing le&s;s than having an enemy &s;o neer them, were then very bu&s;ie about the planting of their <HI>Mais,</HI> and the roots from which they derive their ordinary &s;u&s;tenance: Tho&s;e who liv'd about the great Lake at the foot of the Mountains, which they call in their Language <HI>Theomi,</HI> having perceiv'd this powerful Army ready to fall on them, immediately made their retreat into the neigh|bouring Mountains, and left their villages and cattel to the di|&s;po&s;al of the enemy; thence they took their march through the woods; to carry intelligence of this erruption to the Cities which are in the vallies among the fir&s;t mountains, where re|&s;ided the <HI>Paracou&s;&s;is,</HI> who is the King of the Country, with all the con&s;iderable forces thereof. Upon this &s;o unexpected news, the &s;aid Prince, while he was making his preparations to go again&s;t the Enemy, po&s;ted tho&s;e who were mo&s;t in a rea|dine&s;s for the expedition in the Avenues of the mountains, and placed Ambu&s;cadoes in &s;everal parts of the great Fore&s;ts, which lye between the great Lake and the Mountains, and through which there was a nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing to get into that plea&s;ant and &s;pacious valley, which is above &s;ixty leagues in length, and about ten in bredth; where are the habitations of the chiefe&s;t Inhabitants of the Country, and the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Cities in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>While the <HI>Cofachites</HI> were bu&s;ie about the plundering and pillaging the hou&s;es they had found neer the great Lake, the <HI>Apalachites</HI> had the opportunity to prepare them&s;elves for the reception of them: But the former, in&s;tead of taking the or|dinary

Roads and ways which led to the flat Country, which, as we &s;aid, lie between the Mountains, having left their Wives and Children neer the great Lake, under the guard of &s;ome Forces they had drawn off from the main Body, and being guided by &s;ome of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> whom they had &s;urprized fi&s;hing in the great Lake, cro&s;s'd through the woods, and made their way over mountains and precipices, over and through which the Camels could hardly have pa&s;s'd, and by that means got into the heart and centre of the Country, and found them&s;elves of a &s;udden in a Province, called that of the <HI>Amanites:</HI> They without any re&s;i&s;tance &s;urpriz'd the chiefe&s;t places of it, wherein they found to guard them only Women, Children, and &s;ome old men, &s;uch as were not able to follow their King, who with his people lay expecting the Enemy at the ordinary de&s;cents which led into the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cofachites</HI> perceiving that their de&s;ign had prov'd &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and that there was a great likelihood that in a &s;hort time they &s;hould become Ma&s;ters of the whole Country, &s;ince they had met with &s;o good fortune immediately upon their fir&s;t appearance, pro&s;ecuted their conque&s;ts further, and having Cities for their retreat, where they had left good &s;trong Gar|ri&s;ons, they marched towards the King of <HI>Apalacha,</HI> with a re&s;olution either to fight him, or at lea&s;t oblige him to allow them the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome part of the Country. The <HI>Apalachite</HI> was extreamly &s;urpriz'd, when he under&s;tood that the Enemy, whom he had all this while expected on the Fron|tiers, and at the known avenues of the Country, had already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of a Province that lay in the centre of his Dominions, and that he had left Garri&s;ons in the Cities and mo&s;t con&s;iderable places thereof: However, being a magnani|mous and gallant Prince, he would try whether the chance of Arms would prove as favourable to him, as he thought his cau&s;e good and ju&s;t; he thereupon came down with his people out of the Mountains, where he had encamped him&s;elf; and having encourag'd tho&s;e that were about him to do their ut|mo&s;t, he confidently &s;et upon the van-guard of the <HI>Cofachites,</HI> which was come out to ob&s;erve his motion: having on both &s;ides &s;pent all their arrows, they came to a clo&s;e fight, and ha|ving taken their Clubs, there was a great &s;laughter in both Ar|mies, till that night having &s;eparated them, the <HI>Cofachites</HI> ob|&s;erv'd that they had lo&s;t a great number of theirs in the en|gagement, and found that they had to do with a people that behav'd them&s;elves more valiantly than they had imagined to them&s;elves they would have done; and con&s;equently that their be&s;t cour&s;e would be to enter into a friendly treaty with them, rather than venture another hazard of their Forces in a &s;trange Country.</P>
<P>Upon this they re&s;olv'd, that the next morning they would

<P>The <HI>Paracou&s;&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> having given audience to the&s;e Emba&s;&s;adours, de&s;ir'd that days time to con&s;ider of the Propo&s;itions which had been made to him; and thereupon having requir'd of them the Articles and Conditions under which they would Treat with him, in ca&s;e he might be inclin'd to Peace, they told him, That they had left their own Country with a re&s;olution to plant them&s;elves either by friend&s;hip or by force in that good and fat Country whereof he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; and that if he would conde&s;cend to the former of tho&s;e means, they de&s;ired to become one People with the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> to dwell in their Country, and to cultivate it, and &s;o to &s;upply the empty places of tho&s;e who not long before had gone from among them to plant a new Colony in &s;ome remote parts of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apalachite</HI> a&s;&s;embled his Council upon the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, and having acquainted them therewith, he repre&s;ented, That the Army of the <HI>Cofachites</HI> hindred the coming in of the A&s;&s;i&s;tances which they might receive from the other Provinces that had not been ready to come in to them at the beginning of the War; That by the &s;ame means the pa&s;&s;age of Provi&s;ions was ab&s;olutely ob&s;tructed; That the Enemy was Ma&s;ter of the Field, and that without any re&s;i&s;tance he had got into one of the be&s;t Provinces of the whole Country, where he had al|&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of places of Importance; and, That though in the precedent Engagement he had taken particular notice of the incomparable fidelity and gallantry of his People, in &s;etting upon and fighting again&s;t the Enemies, over whom they had very con&s;iderable Advantages, yet had that good Succe&s;s been bought with the lo&s;s of his mo&s;t valiant Captains, and the be&s;t of his Souldiers; and con&s;equently it concern'd them to bethink them&s;elves of &s;ome means to pre&s;erve the re&s;t of the Kingdom, by &s;paring what was then left of the choice&s;t Men: And &s;ince the Enemies were the fir&s;t Propo&s;ers of the Conditions of Peace, it would be the &s;afe&s;t way to hearken thereto, if it might be done without any derogation from their Glory, and the great Reputation they had acquir'd before; ina&s;much as there was wa&s;te grounds enough in &s;everal places, and that the Country, by rea&s;on of the tran&s;plantation of &s;ome part of their Inhabitants, was &s;pacious and fertile enough to &s;u&s;tain them all.</P>

<P>This news being carried over to the Camp of the <HI>Cofachites,</HI> was receiv'd with great joy, as being con&s;onant to the end they had propos'd to them&s;elves when they fir&s;t undertook the War and left their Country: They thereupon immediately deputed &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t among them to agree with the <HI>Apalachites</HI> about the ab&s;olute conclu&s;ion of that Peace, and to &s;ign the Ar|ticles of the Treaty.

<P>All things being thus &s;etled, both parties laid down their arms, and the <HI>Cofachites</HI> went to fetch their Wives, Children, Cattel, Baggage, and the Souldiers they had left neer the great Lake of <HI>Theomi;</HI> and being &s;afely return'd, they di&s;pos'd them&s;elves into the Cities appointed them, congratulating their good fortune in the conque&s;t of &s;o noble a Country, an|&s;werably to their expectation at the fir&s;t undertaking of the War.</P>
<P>From that time the <HI>Apalachites</HI> gave the name of <HI>Caribbians,</HI> or as the <HI>French</HI> would have it, <HI>Caraibes,</HI> to tho&s;e new comers, who of a &s;udden, and contrary to their expectation, forc'd them|&s;elves upon them, to repair the breach which had been made by the tran&s;plantation of &s;ome of their people into another Country of <HI>America:</HI> &s;o that this word <HI>Caraibes</HI> &s;ignifies, in their language, a &s;ort of <HI>people added,</HI> or <HI>&s;uddenly and unexpe|ctedly coming in, &s;trangers,</HI> or <HI>&s;tout and valiant men;</HI> as if they would expre&s;s, that a generous people, whom they expected not, were come upon them, and had been added to them: and this denomination continu'd to the&s;e new comers in&s;tead of that of <HI>Cofachites,</HI> which hath been kept up only in &s;ome weak and wretched Families which liv'd more towards the north of <HI>Florida,</HI> and after the departure of the true <HI>Cofachites,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of their habitations, and would al&s;o have pa&s;s'd under the name of tho&s;e who had preceded them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Country: Whereas on the other &s;ide, the&s;e true <HI>Cofachites</HI> were known by the name of <HI>Caribbians</HI> in the Province of <HI>Amana;</HI> and therefore henceforward we &s;hall &s;peak of them, and the Colonies which they have &s;ince &s;ent abroad, only under that name.</P>

<P>This breach of promi&s;e on the part of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and that unju&s;tiafiable act, prov'd the occa&s;ion of many bloudy Wars which happen'd afterwards between the two Nations: the <HI>Caribbians</HI> were &s;urrounded of all &s;ides by their adver&s;aries, who kept them in &s;o, that they could not any way enlarge their quarters; and on the other &s;ide the <HI>Apalachites</HI> had in the bow|els of their Country a cruel and irreconcileable enemy, who kept them perpetually in alarms, and oblig'd them to be al|ways in arms; during which, both the one and the other, &s;ometimes victorious, &s;ometimes beaten, as the uncertain chance of war was pleas'd to carry it, liv'd a very &s;ad life; in|&s;omuch that, many times, either for want of cultivating the ground, or by rea&s;on of the wa&s;te committed in the fields of one another, a little before the Harve&s;t, they were reduc'd to &s;uch an extreme Famine, as de&s;troy'd more people than the Sword.</P>
<P>Above an age was &s;pent in the&s;e conte&s;ts, during which the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who had for their Commander in chief and King of their Nation, one of their mo&s;t valiant Captains, whom they called <HI>Ragazim,</HI> added to their former acque&s;ts another Province, which lay next to them on the South &s;ide, and is called <HI>Matica,</HI> which reaching through the Mountains by an interval that receives a torrent de&s;cending from the &s;ame Mountains, afterwards extends towards the We&s;t, as far as the River, which taking its &s;ource at the great Lake, after it hath made &s;everal I&s;lands, and flown through divers Provinces, falls at la&s;st into the Ocean: This is the famous River which the <HI>French</HI> have called the River of <HI>May;</HI> but the <HI>Apalachites</HI> name it <HI>Ba&s;ainim,</HI> which &s;ignifies in their language, <HI>the delici|ous River,</HI> or <HI>abounding</HI> in fi&s;h.

This advice being receiv'd and generally approv'd of all their Prie&s;ts, who are in very great e&s;teem among them, and have Voices in their mo&s;t important A&s;&s;emblies, immediately fur|ni&s;h'd them with expedients, and &s;ugge&s;ted to them the means, which were to this effect.</P>
<P>They had ob&s;erv'd that tho&s;e people who came in &s;o &s;lily and &s;urpriz'd them in their own Country, were without Religion, and made no acknowledgment of any Divinity, whereto they conceiv'd them&s;elves oblig'd to render any publick Service, and that they &s;tood in fear only of a certain evil Spirit which they called <HI>Mabouya,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;ometimes tormented them; yet &s;o as that in the mean time they did not do him any homage: Thence it came that for &s;ome years after their arrival, during which they had liv'd in good corre&s;pondence with them, they endeavour'd to induce them by their example to acknow|ledge the Sun to be the &s;overeign Governour of the World, and to adore him as God. The&s;e Exhortations and In&s;tructions had a great influence over the Spirits of the chiefe&s;t among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and had made &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions in them; &s;o that having receiv'd the fir&s;t Principles of that Religion while the time of their mutual corre&s;pondence continu'd, many left the Province of <HI>Amana</HI> wherein they had their habitations, and went into that of <HI>Bemarin,</HI> the principal Province of the <HI>Apa|lachites,</HI> whence they a&s;cended into the Mountain of <HI>Olaimi,</HI> upon which the <HI>Apalachites</HI> made their &s;olemn Offerings; and upon their invitation the <HI>Caribbians</HI> had participated of tho&s;e Cermonies and that Service: The&s;e Prie&s;ts, whom the <HI>Apala|chites</HI> call <HI>Jaouas,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Men of God,</HI> knew that the &s;eeds of Religion are not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;mother'd in the hearts of men; and that, though the long Wars they had had with the <HI>Caribbians</HI> had hinder'd the exerci&s;e thereof, yet would it be no hard matter for them to blow up, as we may &s;ay, tho&s;e &s;parks in them which lay hid under the a&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Truce and Ce&s;&s;ation of all acts of Ho&s;tility, which had been concluded between the two Nations, pre&s;ented the <HI>Apa|lachites</HI> with a favourable opportunity to pro&s;ecute their de|&s;ign; whereupon the Prie&s;ts of the Sun advis'd, with the Kings Con&s;ent, that there &s;hould be a publication made among the

<HI>Caribbians,</HI> that at the beginning of the Month of <HI>March,</HI> which they call <HI>Naarim</HI> in their language, they would render a &s;olemn Service in honour of the Sun, on the high Mountain; and that the &s;aid Service &s;hould be attended with Diverti&s;ements, Fea&s;t|ing, and Pre&s;ents, which they &s;hould liberally give to &s;uch as were pre&s;ent thereat. This Ceremony was no new thing among the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Caribbians</HI> could not &s;u&s;pect any circumvention, nor fear any &s;urpri&s;e; for it was a very ancient cu&s;tom among them to make extraordinary Prayers to the Sun at the beginning of the Month of <HI>Naarim,</HI> which is preci&s;ely the time that they have done &s;owing their <HI>Mais.</HI> That which they de&s;ire in this Service is, That the Sun would be pleas'd to cau&s;e that which they had recommended to his care, to &s;pring, grow, and come to maturity. They have al&s;o the &s;ame &s;olemnity in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> at which time they have got in their fir&s;t Harve&s;t, to render him thanks for the fruits they conceive that they have receiv'd from his hands. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Caribbians</HI> knew well enough, that during the&s;e Fe&s;tivals the <HI>Apalachites</HI> hung up their Bows and Arrows; that it was accounted a hainous crime among them to go arm'd into their Temple, and to rai&s;e the lea&s;t di&s;pute there; and that during tho&s;e days of Selemni|ty, the greate&s;t Enemies were commonly reconcil'd, and laid a&s;ide all enmity. In fine, they made not the lea&s;t doubt but that the Publick Faith, and the promi&s;e &s;olemnly made, would be inviolably ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Upon this a&s;&s;urance they di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to pa&s;s over into the Province of <HI>Bemarin</HI> at the time appointed; and that they might be thought to contribute &s;omwhat on their part to the publick Solemnity, they dre&s;s them&s;elves with all the brave|ry and magnificence they could; and though that even then they were wont to go very lightly clad, and expo&s;e their bo|dies almo&s;t naked, yet the more to accommodate them&s;elves to the humours of their Neighbours, whom they were going to vi|&s;it, they cau&s;ed&punc; all the Furs, &s;potted Skins, and Stuffs that they had, to be made into Cloaths: They forgot not al&s;o to cau&s;e their faces, their hands, and all tho&s;e places of their bodies which lay expos'd to be &s;een, to be painted with a bright red; and they crown them&s;elves with their riche&s;t Garland, interwo|ven with the different plumage of &s;everal rare Birds of the Country. The Women for their parts, de&s;irous to participate of this Solemnity, leave nothing undone that might contribute any thing to the adorning of them&s;elves; the Chains of Shells of &s;everal colours, the Pendants, and the high Coifs enrich'd with the precious and glittering Stones which the Torrents bring down along with them out of the high Mountains, made them appear with extraordinary lu&s;tre. In this equipage the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> partly out of curio&s;ity, partly out of the vanity to &s;hew them&s;elves, and &s;ome out of certain motives of Religon,

<P>On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Apalachites</HI> expected them with great devotion, and an&s;werably to the Orders they had to that pur|po&s;e receiv'd from their King, who&s;e name was <HI>Teltlabin,</HI> and who&s;e race commands at pre&s;ent among that people; they kindly entertain'd all tho&s;e who came to the Sacrifice; nay, from the fir&s;t entrance of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> into their Province, they treated them at all places as cordially as if they had been their Brethren, and that there had never been any difference between them: They fea&s;ted them all along the way, and conducted them up to the Royal City, which to this day they call <HI>Melilot,</HI> that is, the <HI>City of Councel,</HI> ina&s;much as it is the habi|tation of the King and his Court: The chiefe&s;t of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> were magnificently entertain'd at the Palace-Royal, and tho&s;e of the common &s;ort were receiv'd and treated by the Inhabi|tants of the City, who &s;par'd no co&s;t to heighten the &s;atisfaction of their Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>The day dedicated to the &s;acrifice of the Sun being come, the King of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> with his Court, which was very much encrea&s;ed by the arrival of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and a great number of the Inhabitants of the other Provinces, who were come up to the Fea&s;t, went up very betimes in the morning to the top of the Mountain of <HI>Olaimi,</HI> which is not a full league di&s;tant from the City: This Prince, according to the cu&s;tome of the Country, was carried in a chair, on the &s;houlders of four tall men, attended by four others of the &s;ame height, who were to relieve the former when they were weary: There marched before him &s;everal per&s;ons playing on Flutes and o|ther mu&s;ical In&s;truments; with this pomp he came to the place appointed for the A&s;&s;embly; and when the Ceremony was over, he made a great di&s;tribution of Cloaths and Furs, more than he had been accu&s;tomed to do upon &s;uch occa&s;ions be|fore: But above all, his liberality was remarkable towards the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons among the <HI>Caribbians;</HI> and in imi|tation of the Prince, the wealthie&s;t of his people made pre|&s;ents in like manner to tho&s;e of that Nation who had vouch&s;afed their &s;olemn Sacrifice with their pre&s;ence; &s;o that mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> return'd home well &s;atisfy'd, and in better Liveries than they had brought thence with them: After they were come down from the Mountain, they were again treated and entertain'd with the greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of good will, in all the hou&s;es of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> through who&s;e habitations they were to return into their quarters: In fine, to encourage them

<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> being return'd into their Province could not make &s;ufficient acknowledgments of the kind entertainment they had receiv'd: Tho&s;e who had &s;tay'd at home being ra|vi&s;h'd to &s;ee the rich pre&s;ents which their Country-men had brought home, immediately re&s;olv'd to undertake the &s;ame pilgrimage at the next en&s;uing Fea&s;t: And the day on which it was to be drawing neer, there was &s;o great a conte&s;tation a|mong them who &s;hould go, that if their <HI>Cacick,</HI> or chief Cap|tain, had not taken &s;ome cour&s;e therein, the Province would have been de&s;titute of Inhabitants: The <HI>Apalachites</HI> on the o|ther &s;ide continu'd their entertainments and liberalities; and there was a certain emulation among them who &s;hould be mo&s;t kind to the <HI>Caribbians:</HI> Their Prie&s;ts, who knew what would be the i&s;&s;ue of all this impo&s;ture, recommended nothing &s;o much to them, as the continuation of tho&s;e good Offices, which they &s;aid were very acceptable to the Sun.</P>
<P>Three years &s;lipp'd away in the&s;e vi&s;its; at the end whereof the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> who had exhau&s;ted them&s;elves in liberalities towards their Neighbours, perceiving they had gain'd extream|ly upon their affections, and that the greate&s;t part of them were grown &s;o zealous for the &s;ervice of the Sun, that nothing would be able to force out of their apprehen&s;ions the deep &s;en|timents they had conceiv'd of his Divinity; re&s;olv'd, upon the in&s;tigation of their Prie&s;ts, for who&s;e advice the King and all the people had great re&s;pects and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, to take oc|ca&s;ion from the expiration of the Truce to renew the war again&s;t the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and to forbid them acce&s;s to their Ce|remonies, if they would not, as they did, make a publick pro|fe&s;&s;ion of believing the Sun to be God, and perform the pro|mi&s;e they had &s;ometime made of acknowledging the King of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> for their Sovereign, and do homage to him for the Province of <HI>Amana,</HI> upon which account they had been admitted to be the Inhabitants thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> were divided about the&s;e propo&s;als: For all tho&s;e who were inclin'd to the adoration of the Sun, were of opinion, that &s;atisfaction &s;hould be given to the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> affirming, that, though they were not oblig'd thereto by their promi&s;e, yet would there be an engagement to do it, though it were only to prevent their being depriv'd of the free exer|ci&s;e of their Religion, and debar'd their pre&s;ence at the &s;acri|fices made to the Sun, which they could not abandon without much regret: The <HI>Cacick</HI> or chief Commander, and a great number of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> alledged

on the contrary, that they would not bla&s;t their reputation, and the glory of all their precedent Victories, by &s;o &s;hameful a peace, which, under pretence of Religion, would make them &s;ubject to the <HI>Apalachites;</HI> That they were free-born, and that, as &s;uch, they had left the place of their birth, and tran&s;planted them&s;elves into a better Country than their own, by force of Arms; That their greate&s;t concernment was to endeavour the continuance of that precious liberty, and to cement it with their own blood, if occa&s;ion requir'd; That they were the &s;ame men who had &s;ometime forc'd the <HI>Apalachites</HI> to re&s;ign upto them the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of their Provinces, &s;uch a one as was the centre, and as it were the eye of their Country; That they had not remitted any thing of that genero&s;ity, and that that valour was &s;o far from being extingui&s;h'd, that on the contrary they had enlarg'd their juri&s;diction by the acque&s;t of a noble and &s;pacious Country, which gave them pa&s;&s;age beyond the Mountains, whereby they were &s;urrounded before; That having thus remov'd out of the way whatever might ob&s;truct their de&s;igns, it would be thought an in&s;upportable cowardice in them, only under pretence of Religion, and out of pure curio&s;ity of being pre&s;ent at Sacrifices, to quit the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they had reduc'd under their power with &s;o much trouble and blood&s;hed: In fine, that if any were de&s;irous to adore the Sun, they needed not to go out of their own Terri|tories to do it, &s;ince he &s;hined as favourably in their Provinces as tho&s;e of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> and look'd on them every day as gra|ciou&s;ly as on any other part of the world; and if there were any nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ecrating a Mountain to him, or a Grot, they might find among tho&s;e which &s;eparated their Country from the great Lake, &s;ome that were as high and as fit for tho&s;e my&s;teries as that of <HI>Olaimi.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who maintained the &s;ervice of the Sun, and were again&s;t engaging in a new war, which mu&s;t be the &s;equel of refu&s;ing conditions which were as advantageous to them as to the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> made an&s;wer; that &s;ince they had for &s;ome years enjoy'd the &s;weetne&s;s of peace, and experienc'd upon &s;o many occa&s;ions the kind entertainments and genero&s;ity of their Neighbours, it would be the greate&s;t imprudence in the world to run them&s;elves into new troubles, which they might avoid upon &s;uch ea&s;ie terms, and that without any lo&s;s of the reputation they had acquir'd; That the acknowledgments which the <HI>Apalachites</HI> requir'd for the Province they were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, might be &s;uch, and of &s;o little importance, that it would not be any diminution of their Honour, or prejudice to their Authority; That as to what concern'd the Service and Sacrifices of the Sun, they were not furni&s;h'd with &s;uch Prie&s;ts as were in&s;tructed in that Science, and acquainted with the Ceremonies thereof; That it was much to be fear'd that if they

From all which con&s;idera|tions the Religious party concluded, that their be&s;t cour&s;e was to make a firm peace, that &s;o they might have the conve|nience of participating of the &s;ame Ceremonies for the fu|ture, which they had frequented during the Truce.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who were re&s;olv'd on the contrary &s;ide were &s;o ob&s;tinate, that all tho&s;e remon&s;trances prevail'd nothing upon them, nor could in the lea&s;t divert them from the re&s;olution they had taken never to acknowledge the <HI>Apalachites</HI> for their Sovereigns, nor lo&s;e their liberty under pretence of Re|ligion and way of Wor&s;hip, which their fore-fathers had been ignorant of: So that, in fine, this contrariety of &s;entiments made an ab&s;olute rupture among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> &s;o as to di|vide them into two factions, as the Prie&s;ts of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> had fore&s;een; whereupon being divided al&s;o in their Coun|cels, they could not return an unanimous an&s;wer to the pro|po&s;itions of peace or war which had been made to them by the <HI>Apalachites:</HI> But either party growing &s;tronger and &s;tronger daily, that which voted for an allyance with the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> and &s;tood for the adoration of the Sun, became &s;o powerful as to be in a condition to oblige the other either to embrace their opinion, or quit the Province.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious a Relation to &s;et down here all the mi&s;chiefs and mi&s;eries which that Civil War brought among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who mutually de&s;troy'd one the other, till at la&s;t, after many fights, the <HI>Apalachites</HI> joyning with that party

<HI>Canows</HI> or <HI>Piragos,</HI> about thirteen or fourteen per&s;ons, Inhabi|tants of <HI>Cigateo,</HI> one of the <HI>Lucayan</HI> I&s;lands, who being got a&s;hore, related to the natural Inhabitants of the Country how they had been forc'd thither by a Tempe&s;t; and among other things, they told wonders of the I&s;lands where they liv'd, ad|ding, that there were yet divers others beyond them, towards the Aequator, which lay de&s;art, and were not inhabited, and tho&s;e &s;uch as were accounted better then the others whereof they had given them an account: That for their parts, all they de&s;ired of the Inhabitants of the Country was only &s;ome Pro|vi&s;ions, and a little fre&s;h Water, to enable them to get home to their own Country, from which they conceiv'd them&s;elves to be di&s;tant not above four or five days Sailing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who were &s;tudying where to find out &s;ome new habitation, and extreamly troubled that they had no &s;etled place, where they might no longer be expos'd to the in|conveniences of a wandring kind of life, having heard &s;o much of the&s;e I&s;lands, and that they were not far from the <HI>Lucayas,</HI> re&s;olv'd to make their advantage of the opportunity of tho&s;e Guides, whom they had met with by &s;o extraordinary a good fortune, to follow them, when they &s;hould depart thence, and after their arrival at home, to plant them&s;elves in &s;ome of tho&s;e de&s;art I&s;lands whereof they had given &s;o advantagious an ac|count.</P>
<P>They doubted not but that the execution of this enterprize would put a period to all their mi&s;eries: But there was yet a great ob&s;tacle lay in their way, which at fir&s;st they knew not how to overcome, to wit, the want of Ve&s;&s;els to cro&s;s the Sea, and bring them to the places whereof they de&s;ir'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves: The fir&s;t Propo&s;als were to fell down Trees, and to make them hollow with fire, as other Nations did, nay that among whom they then were: But that expedient requir'd a long time to compa&s;s it, while in the interim, tho&s;e whom they hoped to have for their Conductors would be gone: Where|upon they thought it the &s;ure&s;t way to find out Ve&s;&s;els ready made: To that end they re&s;olv'd in the night time to &s;eize on all tho&s;e which the Nations of the neighbouring Creeks, and and &s;uch as liv'd neer the Rivers which fall thereabouts into the Sea, had ready in their Ports, and in condition fit for the Sea. The day being come for the departure of the <HI>Lucayans,</HI> who were to be their Guides, our <HI>Caribbians</HI> who had furni&s;h'd them&s;elves before-hand with all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions, met toge|ther the mo&s;t &s;ecretly they could, along the River-&s;ides and neer the Ports, and having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of all the <HI>Ca|nows</HI> or Ve&s;&s;els they met with, joyn'd with the <HI>Lucayans,</HI> with whom, without taking any leave of their Ho&s;ts, they &s;et Sail for the <HI>Lucayas.</HI></P>
<P>The Wind having prov'd favourable to the&s;e Fugitives, they
<PB N="225" REF="126">
got in a few days to <HI>Cigateo,</HI> where they were very civilly en|tertain'd by the Inhabitants, who, having &s;upply'd them with all nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments, conducted them to the mo&s;t remote of their I&s;lands, and thence gave them a Convoy to bring them to the next of the de&s;art I&s;lands whereof they had given them a relation, which they call'd <HI>Ayay,</HI> but it is now call'd <HI>Santa Cruz:</HI> In their pa&s;&s;age they &s;ail'd by the I&s;land of <HI>Boriquen,</HI> now call'd <HI>Porto-Rico,</HI> which was inhabited by a very powerful Nation.</P>
<P>It was then in the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Ayay</HI> that our <HI>Caribbians</HI> laid the fir&s;t foundations of their Colony, and where enjoying an undi&s;turbed Peace, which made them forget all precedent mi&s;|fortunes, they multipli'd &s;o, that within a few years they were forc'd to &s;pread them&s;elves into all the other I&s;lands now known by the name of the <HI>Caribbbies:</HI> And &s;ome Ages after, having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of all the inhabitable I&s;lands, they tran&s;ported them&s;elves into the Continent of the Meridional part of <HI>America,</HI> where they have at this day many great and nu|merous Colonies, wherein they are &s;o well &s;etled, that though the <HI>Yaos,</HI> the <HI>Sappayos,</HI> the <HI>Paragotis,</HI> the <HI>Arouacas</HI> or <HI>Arouagues,</HI> who are their Neighbours in the I&s;land of <HI>Trinity,</HI> and the Pro|vinces of <HI>Orinoca,</HI> have often attempted to force them out of their habitations, and engag'd again&s;t them with all their For|ces, yet do they &s;till continue in them in a flouri&s;hing conditi|on, and entertain &s;o good a corre&s;pondence and &s;o perfect a friend&s;hip with our <HI>Caribbians,</HI> the Inhabitants of the I&s;lands, that the&s;e latter march out once or twice a year to their relief, joyning all together with the <HI>Calibites,</HI> their Friends and Con|federates, again&s;t the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> and other Nations, their com|mon Enemies.</P>
<P>There is yet another Story concerning the origine of the In|&s;ulary <HI>Caribbians,</HI> which is, That they are de&s;cended from their Confederates the <HI>Calibites;</HI> and we are apt to believe &s;omwhat of it may be true, as being the only account which mo&s;t of them can give of them&s;elves: For the&s;e <HI>Caribbians</HI> being le&s;s pow|erful then the <HI>Calibites,</HI> when they fir&s;t came among them into the Continent, and having afterwards enter'd into Alliance with them by Marriages and common concernments, they made up together but one people, and &s;o there en&s;u'd a mutual com|munication of Language and particular Cu&s;toms: And thence it comes that a great part of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> having forgot their fir&s;t origine, would have it believ'd that they are de&s;cended from the <HI>Calibites:</HI> And it is to be pre&s;um'd, that it being out of all memory of man, when their Predece&s;&s;ors came from the Northern parts into the&s;e I&s;lands, they have not any knowledg of their Native Country, which having ca&s;t them out of her bo&s;om, and treated them as Rebels, was not &s;o far regretted by tho&s;e poor Fugitives, as that they &s;hould be over-careful
<PB N="226" REF="127" MS="y">
to pre&s;erve the memory of it. On the contrary, it is credible, that the &s;ooner to forget the mi&s;eries they had &s;uffer'd, they ef|fac'd the &s;ad ideas therof as much as they could, and were glad of any other Origine: It may be al&s;o, that when the <HI>Caribbians</HI> fir&s;t enter'd the I&s;lands, upon their coming from the North, they were not &s;o de&s;titute of Inhabitants, but that there were here and there &s;ome Families which might have pa&s;s'd over thither from the I&s;lands of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> or <HI>Porto-Rico,</HI> which they de|&s;troy'd, re&s;erving only the Women, whom they might make u&s;e of for the propagation of their Colony: And of this there is yet a greater probability, in that the&s;e <HI>Caribbians</HI> being bani&s;h'd from among the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> and by War forc'd to leave the Country to the victorious Party, many of their Wives &s;taid behind among the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> and the re&s;t of their own Nati|on who had joyn'd with them: And thence po&s;&s;ibly may pro|ceed the difference there is between the Language of the Men and that of the Women among&s;t the <HI>Caribbians.</HI></P>
<P>But to give a more particular account of tho&s;e Colonies of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> which are in the Meridional Continent of <HI>America,</HI> in the fir&s;t place, the Relations of tho&s;e who have entred into the famous River of <HI>Orenoca,</HI> di&s;tant from the Line, Northward, eight degrees and fifty minutes, affirm, that at a great di&s;tance within the Country, there live certain <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> who might ea&s;ily have pa&s;s'd over thither from the I&s;land of <HI>Tabago,</HI> which, of all the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> is the neere&s;t to that Continent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Relations acquaint us, that, advancing yet fur|ther towards the Aequator, there lies, at &s;even degrees from that Line, the great and famous River of <HI>E&s;&s;equeba,</HI> neer which are planted fir&s;t the <HI>Aro&uuml;agues,</HI> and next to them the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who are continually in war with them, and have their habita|tions above the falls of that River, which de&s;cend with great violence from the Mountains; and thence the&s;e <HI>Caribbians</HI> reach to the &s;ource of the &s;ame River, and are very numerous, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a va&s;t territory.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Travellers relate, that within &s;ix degrees of the Line lies the River <HI>Sarname,</HI> or <HI>Suriname,</HI> into which falls ano|ther River named <HI>Ikouteca,</HI> all along which there are many Villages inhabited by <HI>Caribbians.</HI></P>
<P>There is be&s;ides a numerous people of the &s;ame Nation, Inhabitants of a Country which reaches a great way into the Continent, the coa&s;ts whereof extend to the fifth and &s;ixth degree North of the Aequator, &s;cituate along a fair and great River named <HI>Marouyne,</HI> about eighteen Leagues di&s;tant from that of <HI>Sarname,</HI> which from its &s;ource cro&s;&s;es up and down above two hundred leagues of Country, in which there are ma|ny Villages inhabited by <HI>Caribbians;</HI> who, ob&s;erving the &s;ame cu&s;tome with the I&s;landers, make choice of the mo&s;t valiant
<PB N="227" REF="127">
among them for their <HI>Cacicks,</HI> or Commanders in chief, and are &s;omewhat of a higher &s;tature than tho&s;e Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> yet not differing much from them, &s;ave only that &s;ome of them cover their privy parts with a piece of cloth, but ra|ther for ornament, than out of any con&s;ideration of &s;hame or mode&s;ty: Tho&s;e therefore who have travell'd into tho&s;e Countries affirm, that, from the mouth of the River <HI>Marouyne,</HI> which lies at five degrees and forty five minutes of the Line to the North, to the &s;ource of it, there are twenty days &s;ail, and that all along it the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have their Villages like tho&s;e of our I&s;landers.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve further out of the Voyages of &s;ome <HI>Dutch,</HI> that the Inhabitants of that Continent, through which the River of <HI>Cayenna</HI> makes its pa&s;&s;age into the Ocean, are naturally <HI>Caribbians.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but that the&s;e <HI>Caribbians</HI> might cro&s;s tho&s;e Countries as far as <HI>Bra&s;il;</HI> for tho&s;e who have made voyages thither, affirm, that among the Provinces, which lie along the coa&s;ts of the South-Sea, there are &s;ome people, com|monly known by the name of <HI>Caribbians;</HI> and that being of a more hardy and daring con&s;titution, as al&s;o more apprehen&s;ive and &s;ubtle than the other <HI>Indians,</HI> Inhabitants of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> they are &s;o highly e&s;teemed among them, that they conceive them to be endu'd with a more excellent kind of knowledge than the others; whence it comes that they have a great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion for their Coun&s;els, and de&s;ire them to pre&s;ide at all their Fe&s;ti|vals and rejoicings, which they &s;eldom celebrate without the pre&s;ence of &s;ome one of the&s;e <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who upon that ac|count take their progre&s;s up and down the Villages, where they are receiv'd with acclamations, entertainments and great kindne&s;s, as <HI>John de Lery</HI> hath ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Were it nece&s;&s;ary to produce any further confirmation to prove that the&s;e <HI>Caribbians,</HI> &s;cattered into &s;o many places of the Continent of the Meridional part of <HI>America,</HI> are of the &s;ame Nation with the <HI>I&s;landers,</HI> we might alledge what is una|nimou&s;ly affirm'd by the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Colonies planted in tho&s;e coa&s;ts, to wit, tho&s;e of <HI>Cayenna</HI> and <HI>Berbica,</HI> both neighbours to the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Continent, to &s;hew the conformity and re&s;emblance there is in many things, as con&s;titution, man|ners, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. between them and the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> of whom we &s;hall give an account hereafter: But it is time we conclude this chapter, which is already grown to a great length; yet could it not be divided, by rea&s;on of the uniformity and connexion of the matter.</P>
<P>Yet have we a word further to add, in an&s;wer to a que&s;tion, which the curio&s;ity of &s;ome per&s;on might haply take occa&s;ion to &s;tart, which is, How long it may be &s;ince the <HI>Caribbians</HI> came out of <HI>Florida</HI> into the&s;e I&s;lands? We mu&s;t acknowledge
<PB N="228" REF="128" MS="y">
there can no certain account be given of it, ina&s;much as the&s;e Nations have commonly no other Annals than their own me|mories: But in regard tho&s;e people ordinarily live two hun|dred years, it is not to be thought &s;trange that the occurrences happening among them, &s;hould be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity to three or four Generations. And to confirm this, we may aver that there are many men and women among them who can give an exact account of the fir&s;t arrival of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as if it had happened but ye&s;terday: So that the re|membrance of the departure of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> out of <HI>Florida,</HI> and the wars they have had there, being yet fre&s;h among the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> tho&s;e who have heard them di&s;cour&s;e, conjecture that it may be about five hundred years &s;ince tho&s;e things came to pa&s;s. But if it be further que&s;tion'd, why they did not en|deavour to make their way back again into <HI>Florida,</HI> to be re|veng'd of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> and tho&s;e of their own Nation, who had forc'd them thence, e&s;pecially after they had multiply'd and recruited them&s;elves &s;o powerfully in the I&s;lands? it may be an&s;wered, That the difficulty of Navigation, which is very ea&s;ie from the <HI>Caribbies</HI> to <HI>Florida,</HI> but very dangerous from <HI>Florida</HI> to the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> the winds being commonly contrary, chill'd the earne&s;tne&s;s they might have to make any &s;uch at|tempt. In the next place it is to be noted, that the air of the I&s;lands being warmer, and the &s;oil as good, and in all appea|rance more &s;uitable to their con&s;titution than that of <HI>Florida,</HI> they apprehended, that tho&s;e who had forc'd them thence, had, contrary to their intentions, procur'd them a greater hap|pine&s;s than they could have de&s;ir'd, and, thinking to make them mi&s;erable, had made them fortunate in their exile.</P>

<P>SInce we have had occa&s;ion to &s;peak &s;o much concerning the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> and that above one half of the ancient <HI>Caribbi|ans,</HI> after the expul&s;ion of tho&s;e among them who would not adore the Sun, have to this pre&s;ent made up one people and one Common-wealth with tho&s;e <HI>Apalachites,</HI> it will be con&s;o|nant to our de&s;ign, e&s;pecially &s;ince the &s;ubject thereof is rare and little known, if we give &s;ome account of the nature of their Country, and the mo&s;t remarkable things that are in it; as al&s;o of the manners of the Inhabitants, the Religion they

have had heretofore, and that which they profe&s;s at this day, as we have the particulars thereof from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who have traded among them, and have not long &s;ince laid the founda|tions of a Colony in the mid&s;t of the noble&s;t, and be&s;t known of their Provinces.</P>
<P>The Territories of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix Provinces, whereof three are comprehended within that noble and &s;paci|ous Vale which is encompa&s;s'd by the Mountains of the <HI>Apa|lates,</HI> at the foot whereof the&s;e people inhabit: The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of tho&s;e Provinces, and which lies towards the Ea&s;t, wherein the King keeps his Court; is called <HI>Bemarin:</HI> That which is in the mid&s;t, and as it were in the centre of the three, is called <HI>Amani</HI> or <HI>Amana:</HI> And the third of tho&s;e which are within that Vale, is known by the name of <HI>Matica.</HI> True it is, that this la&s;t, which begins in the Vale, reaches a great way into the Mountains, nay goes yet much beyond, even to the South-&s;ide of the great Lake, which they call <HI>Theomi:</HI> The other Provinces are <HI>Schama</HI> and <HI>Meraco,</HI> which are in the <HI>Apalatean</HI> Mountains; and <HI>Achalaques,</HI> which is partly in the Mountains, and partly in the Plain, and com|prehends all the Mar&s;hes and Fenny places, confining on the great Lake <HI>Theomi,</HI> on the North-&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Country under the King of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> being thus divided into &s;ix Provinces, there are in it &s;ome Mountains of a va&s;t extent and prodigious height, which are for the mo&s;t part inhabited by a people living only upon what they get by hunting, there being great &s;tore of wild bea&s;ts in tho&s;e Wil|derne&s;&s;es: Be&s;ides which, there are al&s;o certain Vales, which are peopled by a Nation that is le&s;s barbarous, &s;uch as addicts it &s;elf to the cultivation of the earth, and is &s;u&s;tain'd by the fruits it produces: And la&s;tly, there are abundance of Mar&s;hes and Fenny places, and a great Lake, whereof the Inhabitants are very numerous, maintaining them&s;elves by fi&s;hing, and what the little good ground they have furni&s;hes them with|all.</P>
<P>The three Provinces which are within the Vale, which, as we &s;aid in the precedent Chapter, is &s;ixty leagues in length, and about ten more in bredth, lie as it were in a Champion Country, &s;ave only, that in &s;ome places there are certain ri|&s;ings and eminences, on which the Towns and Villages are commonly built; many little Rivers, which de&s;cend from the Mountains, and abound in Fi&s;h, cro&s;s it up and down in &s;eve|ral places: That part of it which is not reduc'd to culture is well furni&s;h'd with fair trees of an exce&s;&s;ive height: For in|&s;tance, there are <HI>Cedars, Cypre&s;s, Pines, Oaks, Panamas,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>Saxafras,</HI> and an infinite variety of others which have no proper names among us.</P>
<P>As concerning the Fruit-trees of this Country, be&s;ides Che&s;t|nut
<PB N="230" REF="129">
and Walnut-Trees, which grow naturally there, the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> who have planted them&s;elves in tho&s;e parts, as we &s;hall relate more at large towards the end of this Chapter, have planted Orange-trees, &s;weet and &s;harp Citrons, Lemons, &s;e|veral &s;orts of Apples and Pears, and divers Stones, as of Plumbs, Cherries, and Apricocks, which have thriv'd and multi|plied &s;o, that in &s;ome places of this Country there are more <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> fruits then in any other part of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o good &s;tore of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er &s;ort of Trees which bear leaves or flowers of &s;weet &s;cent, &s;uch as Laurel, Je&s;&s;emine, Ro&s;es, Ro&s;emary, and all tho&s;e others that are &s;o ornamental in the Garden: Nor is there any want of Pinks, Carnations, Tu|lips, Violets, Lillies, and all the other Flowers which adorn Knots and Borders.</P>
<P>Pot-herbs al&s;o, and all &s;orts of Pul&s;e and Roots, thrive very well there: Citruls, Cucumbers, and Melons are common all Summer long, and as well ta&s;ted as tho&s;e which grow in any part of the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></P>
<P>Strawberries and Ra&s;pberries grow in the Woods without any culture: They have al&s;o Small-nuts, Goo&s;eberries, and an infinite variety of other &s;mall Fruits, which in their degree contribute to the delight and refre&s;hment of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Wheat, Barly, Rie, and Oats which &s;ome &s;ow'd there at &s;everal Sea&s;ons, and in different Soils, hath grown only to the blade; but in requital, there grows every where &s;uch abun|dance of &s;mall Millet, Lentils, Chick-pea&s;e, Fetches, and Mais, or Turki&s;h Wheat, which are &s;own and harve&s;ted twice a year, that the Inhabitants of the Plain Country have enough to &s;upply tho&s;e who live towards the Mountains, who bring them in exchange &s;everal &s;orts of Furs. The Lands that are &s;own with Turki&s;h Wheat are enclos'd with Quick-&s;et Hedges, planted on both &s;ides with Fruit-trees, mo&s;t whereof are co|ver'd with wild Vines, which grow at the foot of the Trees.</P>
<P>As to the Volatiles of this Country, there are Turkeys, Pintadoes, Parrots, Woodqui&s;ts, Turtles, Birds of prey, Eagles, Gee&s;e, Ducks, Herons, white Sparrows, <HI>Tonatzuli,</HI> a kind of bird that &s;ings as &s;weetly as the Nightingal, and is of an excellent plumage; and abundance of other Birds commonly &s;een neer Rivers and in the Fore&s;ts, quite different from tho&s;e that are &s;een in other parts of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apalachites</HI> have no knowledge at all of Sea-fi&s;h, as be|ing at too great a di&s;tance from the Coa&s;ts; but they take abun|dance in the Rivers and Lakes, which are extreamly nouri&s;h|ing, of an excellent ta&s;te, and much about the bigne&s;s and in figure &s;omwhat like our Pikes, Carps, Perches, and Barbels: They al&s;o take Ca&s;tors and Bevers neer the great Rivers, Lakes, and Pools; they eat the fle&s;h of them, and make Furs of the Skins, for Winter-caps and other u&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="129" MS="y">There is no venemous creature nor any wild bea&s;t in the lower part of the Country; for the Inhabitants of the Moun|tains, who are expert Hunt&s;men, drive them into the Fore&s;ts, where they find them continual work and &s;port: So that the flocks of &s;heep, and herds of cattel and &s;wine graze up and down the skirts of the Mountains without any body to look after them.

<P>The Inhabitants of the other Provinces which are &s;eated in the Vales and Plains, went heretofore naked from the Na|vel upwards, in the Summer-time, and in Winter, they wore garments of Furrs; but now both men and women are clad all the year long: In the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, they have light cloaths, made of cotton, wooll, or a certain herb, of which they make a thred as &s;trong as that of Flax: The women have the art of &s;pinning all the&s;e materials; and weaving them into &s;everal kinds of &s;tuffs, which are la&s;ting; and delightful to the eie. But in the winter, which many times is hard enough, they are all clad in &s;everal kinds of skins, which they have the skill to dre&s;s well enough: They leave the hair on &s;ome, and &s;o make u&s;e of them as Furs: They have al&s;o the art of tanning Ox-hides, and other skins, and making Shoes and Boots of them.</P>
<P>The men wear Caps made of Otter-skins, which are perfectly black and glittering, pointed before, and &s;et out behind with &s;ome rich feathers, which hanging down over their &s;houlders make them look very gracefully: but the women have no
<PB N="232" REF="130">
other ornament about the head, but what is deriv'd from the &s;everal dre&s;&s;es of their hair: They make holes in their ears, and wear pendants of Chry&s;tal, or made of a certain &s;mooth &s;tone they have, which is of as bright a green as that of an Emrald: Of the &s;ame materials they al&s;o make great Neck|laces, which they wear when they would appear in &s;tate: They make great account of Corral, Chry&s;tal, and yellow Am|ber, which are brought to them by Strangers; and they are only the Wives of the principal Officers that have Bracelets and Necklaces made of them: Though there be &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families among them, yet have they not alter'd any thing either as to their Cloaths or cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>The ordinary &s;ort of people wear only a clo&s;e coat without &s;leeves, over a thin garment of Goat-skins, which &s;erves them for &s;hirts: The Coat which comes down to the calf of the leg, is ty'd about the wa&s;t with a leathern girdle, which is &s;et out with &s;ome little embroidery: But the Officers and Heads of Families wear over that a kind of &s;hort Cloak, which co|vers only the back and the arms, though behind it falls down to the ground: This Cloak is fa&s;ten'd with &s;trong leathern points, which make it fa&s;t under the neck, and lye clo&s;e to the &s;houlders: The womens garments are of the &s;ame fa&s;hion with tho&s;e of the men, &s;ave that tho&s;e of the former come down to the ankles, and the Cloak hath two open places on the &s;ides, through which they put forth their arms.</P>
<P>To keep them&s;elves clear of Vermine, they often wa&s;h their bodies with the juice of a certain root, which is of as &s;weet a &s;cent as the <HI>Flower-de-luce</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> and hath this further vertue, that it makes the nerves more &s;upple, and fortifies and cau&s;es a &s;moothne&s;s all over the body, and communicates an extraordinary delightful &s;cent thereto.</P>
<P>The Cities of the three Provinces that are in the &s;pacious Plain, which is at the foot of the Mountains, are encompa&s;&s;ed on the out&s;ide by a large and deep Moat, which on the in&s;ide, in&s;tead of wals, is all planted with great po&s;ts pointed at the top, thru&s;t a good depth into the ground; or &s;ometimes with quick-&s;et hedges intermixt with very &s;harp thorns; they are commonly about five or &s;ix foot in bredth: The Gates are &s;mall and narrow, and are made fa&s;t with little pieces of wood, which lie cro&s;s between &s;mall ramperts of earth that are on both &s;ides, and which command the avenues: There are commonly but two Gates to every City; to enter in at them, a man mu&s;t pa&s;s over a bridge &s;o narrow, that two men cannot well march on a front upon it: The Bridge is built upon piles, which &s;u&s;tain certain planks, which they draw up in the night when they fear the lea&s;t trouble.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom &s;een that there is above one City in every Pro|vince; nay there are &s;ome that have not above eight hundred
<PB N="233" REF="130">
hou&s;es in them: The Metropolis of the Country, which is cal|led <HI>Melilot,</HI> hath above two thou&s;and; they are all built of pieces of wood planted into the ground and joined one to ano|ther: The covering is for the mo&s;t part of the leaves of reeds, gra&s;s, or ru&s;hes: Tho&s;e of the Captains are done over with a certain Ma&s;tick, which keeps off the rain, and pre&s;erves the thatch from decaying in many years: The floors of all the hou&s;es is of the &s;ame material, whereto they add a certain gol|den &s;and which they get out of the neighbouring Mountains, and which gives &s;uch a lu&s;tre as if they were &s;own with little &s;pangles of Gold.</P>
<P>The Rooms of the ordinary &s;ort of people are hung only with a kind of Mat, made of Plantane-leaves and ru&s;hes, which they have the art of dying into &s;everal colours; tho&s;e of per&s;ons con&s;iderable among them, are hung with pre|cious Furs, or Deer-skins painted with divers figures, or with a kind of Tapi&s;try made of Birds-feathers, which they &s;o in|du&s;triou&s;ly intermingle, that it &s;eems to be embroidered: Their Beds are about a foot and a half from the ground, and are co|ver'd with skins that are dre&s;s'd, and as &s;oft as can be wi&s;h'd: The&s;e skins are commonly painted with Flowers, Fruits, and a hundred &s;uch inventions, and their colours are &s;o well &s;et on and &s;o lively, that at a di&s;tance one would take them for rich Tapi&s;try: The wealtheir &s;ort in the winter time have their beds covered with the skins of Martins, Beavers, or white Foxes, which are &s;o well dre&s;s'd, and perfum'd with &s;uch artifice, that they never admit any thing of ordure: The Officers and all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Inhabitants lie on Mattre&s;&s;es fill'd with a certain down that grows on a little plant, and is as &s;oft as &s;ilk; but the common people take their re&s;t on dry'd &s;ern, which hath the property of taking away the wearine&s;s of the body, and retriving the forces exhau&s;ted by hunting, gardening, and all the other painful exerci&s;es con&s;equent to their cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;els they u&s;e in their hou&s;es are either of wood or earth, enamel'd with divers colours, and very delightfully painted: They &s;harpen upon &s;tones the teeth of &s;everal wild bea&s;ts, and therewith arm their Arrows and Lances: Before &s;trangers came among them and traded in their Country, they knew not there was &s;uch a thing as Iron; but they made u&s;e of extraordinary hard and &s;harp &s;tones in&s;tead of wedges, and certain &s;mooth and cutting bones, in&s;tead of knives.</P>
<P>They all live very amicably together under the conduct of a King, who keeps his Court at <HI>Melilot,</HI> the Metropolis of the Kingdome: In every City there is a Governour, and other &s;ubordinate Officers, who are appointed by him, and chang'd at his plea&s;ure, as he thinks mo&s;t convenient: The Villages al&s;o have Captains and heads of Families, by whom they are
<PB N="234" REF="131" MS="y">
governed. All immoveable goods are common among the&s;e people, and excepting only their hou&s;es, and the little gardens belonging to them, they have no propriety in any thing: they carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of Agriculture in common, and they &s;hare the fruits of the earth among them&s;elves: At &s;owing-time the Governors and their Officers over&s;ee the work; and at that time all tho&s;e who are of age to do any thing abroad, go out be|times in the morning to their work, and continue there till the evening, at which time they return to their Towns and Villages to take their re&s;t: While they are at work, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of their Chiefs to provide them &s;omewhat extraordi|nary in meat and drink: They di&s;po&s;e their Harve&s;t into the publick Granaries, which are in the mid&s;t of their Towns and Villages; and at every full Moon, and at every new Moon, tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the di&s;tribution thereof, &s;upply every Family, according to the number of per&s;ons whereof it con&s;i&s;ts, with as much as will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>They are a temperate people, and hate all kind of voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;s, and whatever tends to effeminacy: And though Vines grow naturally in their Country, yet do they not make any wine but what is requi&s;ite for the divine &s;ervice: Fair water is their ordinary drink, but at great entertainments, they make u&s;e of a plea&s;ant kind of Beer, which is made of <HI>Turkey</HI> wheat: They al&s;o have the art of making an excellent kind of Hydro|mel, or Mead, which they keep in great earthen ve&s;&s;els: The great abundance of honey which they find among the Rocks, and in the clefts of hollow trees, &s;upplies them with that whereof they make that delicious drink, which is &s;uch as may well pa&s;s for Sack, e&s;pecially after it hath been kept a long time.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the &s;ame Family live &s;o lovingly together, that there are among them &s;ome hou&s;es where an old man hath his children, and his children's children, to the third, nay &s;ome|times to the fourth generation, all living under the &s;ame roof, to the number of a hundred per&s;ons, and &s;ometimes more. Mo&s;t of the other Nations of the Septentrional part of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> who inhabit along the Sea-coa&s;t, are &s;o &s;lothful, that in the winter time they are in great want, becau&s;e they had not &s;own any thing when the time &s;erved, or had con&s;umed the fruits of the precedent harve&s;t in extraordinary entertain|ments and debauches: But the <HI>Apalachites</HI> hate nothing &s;o much as idlene&s;s, and they are &s;o addicted to pains-taking, that the fruits of the earth, being an&s;werable to their labour, and be|ing di&s;tributed with prudence and moderation, maintain them plentifully, nay &s;o that they can, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, a&s;&s;i&s;t their Neighbours the Inhabitants of the Mountains: Both men and women are perpetually employ'd, after &s;eed-time and harve&s;t, in &s;pinning of Cotton, Wooll, and a certain Herb, which is &s;oft
<PB N="235" REF="131" MS="y">
and &s;trong, for the making of cloth, and &s;everal ordinary &s;orts of &s;tuffs, wherewith they cover them&s;elves: Some among them employ them&s;elves in making of earthen ware; others in ma|king Tapi&s;try of the plumage of Birds; others, in making of Baskets, Panniers, and other little pieces of hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, which they do with a &s;trange indu&s;try.</P>
<P>They are of a very loving and obliging di&s;po&s;ition: And whereas their di&s;tance from the Sea exempts them from being &s;ubject to receive any di&s;plea&s;ure from Strangers, they are in like manner ignorant what entertainments to make them, when they chance to vi&s;it them, and are never weary of expre&s;&s;ing all manner of friend&s;hip towards them: They are docible and &s;u&s;ceptible of all &s;orts of good di&s;ciplines; but they have this di&s;commendable in them, that they are very ob&s;tinate in their opinions, ea&s;ily angred, and much addicted to revenge, when they are convinc'd that they have been injur'd: They are ex|treamly apt to give credit to their dreams, and they have &s;ome old dotards among them, who openly make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to interpret them, and foretell what things &s;hall happen after them.</P>
<P>They have had a long continuance of peace; however they think it prudence to &s;tand always upon their guard, and they have always Sentinels at the avenues of their Cities, to prevent the incur&s;ions of a certain &s;avage and extreamly cruel people, which hath no &s;etled habitation, but wander up and down the Provinces with an incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, making havock where-ever they come, e&s;pecially where they find no re&s;i|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Arms of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> are, the Bow, the Club, the Sling, and a kind of great Javelin, which they dart out of their hands, when they have &s;pent all their Arrows: And whereas tho&s;e that inhabit towards the woods and in the Mountains, live only by hunting, continual exerci&s;e makes them &s;o expert in &s;hooting with the Bow, that the King, who alwaies hath a Company of them about his per&s;on, hath no greater diver&s;ion than to &s;ee them &s;hoot at a mark for &s;ome prize, which he gives him who in fewe&s;t &s;hots came to the place a&s;&s;ign'd, or hath &s;hot down a Crown &s;et up upon the top of a Tree.</P>
<P>They are pa&s;&s;ionate lovers of Mu&s;ick, and all in&s;truments that make any kind of harmony, in&s;omuch that there's very few among them but can play on the Flute, and a kind of Hawboy, which being of &s;everal bigne&s;s, make a pa&s;&s;ably good harmo|ny, and render a &s;ound that is very melodious: They are migh|tily given to dancing, capering, and making a thou&s;and po&s;tures, whereby they are of opinion they disburthen them&s;elves of all their bad humours, and that they acquire a great activity and &s;upplene&s;s of body, and a wonderful &s;wiftne&s;s in running. They heretofore celebrated &s;olemn dances at the end of every
<PB N="236" REF="132" MS="y">
harve&s;t, and after they had made their Offerings to the Sun upon the Mountain of <HI>Olaimi;</HI> but now they have no &s;et and appointed time for the&s;e diverti&s;ements.</P>
<P>Their voice is naturally good, mild, flexible, and plea&s;ant; whence it comes that many among them make it their endea|vour to imitate the &s;inging and chirping of Birds; wherein they are for the mo&s;t part &s;o fortunate, that like &s;o many <HI>Or|pheus</HI>'s they entice out of the woods to follow them, tho&s;e Birds which think they hear only tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies: They do al&s;o by &s;inging alleviate the hard labour they are ad|dicted unto, and yet what they do, &s;eems to be done rather out of diverti&s;ement, and to avoid idlene&s;s, than out of any con&s;ideration of advantage that they make thereof.</P>
<P>Their Language is very &s;mooth, and very plentiful in com|pari&s;ons: That &s;poken by the Captains and all per&s;ons of quality, is more elegant and fuller of flouri&s;hes than that of the common &s;ort of people: Their expre&s;&s;ions are very preci&s;e, and their periods &s;hort enough: While they are yet children, they learn &s;everal &s;ongs, made by the <HI>Jaouas</HI> in honour and commendation of the Sun; they are al&s;o acquainted with &s;e|veral other little pieces of Poetry, wherein they have com|prehended the mo&s;t memorable exploits of their Kings, out of a de&s;ign to perpetuate the memory thereof among them, and the more ea&s;ily tran&s;mit it to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>All the Provinces which acknowledge the King of <HI>Apala|cha</HI> for their Sovereign, under&s;tand the language commonly &s;poken in his Court; yet does not this hinder but that each of them hath a particular dialect of its own, whence it comes that the language of &s;ome, is in &s;ome things different from that of others of the Inhabitants: The Provinces of <HI>Amana</HI> and <HI>Matica,</HI> in which there are to this day many <HI>Caribbian</HI> Fami|lies, have retained to this pre&s;ent many words of the ancient idiome of the&s;e people, which confirms what we have laid down for a certain a&s;&s;ertion, to wit, that being known by the &s;ame name, and having many expre&s;&s;ions common to them with the Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands, tho&s;e Families have al&s;o the &s;ame origine with them, as we have repre&s;ented in the pre|cedent chapter.</P>
<P>They heretofore adored the Sun, and had their Prie&s;ts, whom they called <HI>Jaouas,</HI> who were very &s;uper&s;titious in ren|dring to him the &s;ervice which they had invented in honour of him: their per&s;wa&s;ion was, that the raies of the Sun gave life to all things; that they dried up the earth; and that once the Sun having continued four and twenty hours under an eclip&s;e, the earth had been overflown; and that the great Lake which they call <HI>Theomi,</HI> was rais'd as high as the tops of the highe&s;t Mountains that encompa&s;s it; but that the Sun having reco|vered the eclip&s;e, had, by his pre&s;ence, forc'd the waters to
<PB N="237" REF="132">
return into their aby&s;&s;es; that only the Mountain dedicated to his honour, and wherein his Temple was, was pre&s;erv'd from that deluge; and that their Predece&s;&s;ors, and all the bea&s;ts which are at pre&s;ent in the woods and upon the earth, having retir'd to the &s;aid Mountain, were pre&s;erv'd for the repopulation and recruit of the whole earth: So that they conceive them&s;elves to be the mo&s;t ancient people of the world; And they affirm, that from that time they have ac|knowledg'd the Sun for their God.</P>
<P>They were of opinion, that th&eacute; Sun had built him&s;elf the Temple which is in the Mountain of <HI>Olaimi,</HI> the a&s;cent where|of is di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Melilot</HI> &s;omewhat le&s;s than a league; and that the <HI>Tonatzuli</HI> (which are certain little birds about the bigne&s;s of a Quail, and who&s;e bellies and wings are of a bright yellow, the back of a sky-colour, and the head of a plumage, partly red, and partly white) are the me&s;&s;en|gers and children of the Sun, which alwaies celebrate his prai&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ervice they rendred the Sun con&s;i&s;ted in &s;aluting him at his ri&s;ing, and &s;inging hymns in honour of him: They ob|&s;erved the &s;ame Ceremonies al&s;o in the evening, entreating him to return, and to bring the day along with him: And be|&s;ides this daily &s;ervice which every one performed at the door of his hou&s;e, they had al&s;o another publick and &s;olemn &s;ervice, which con&s;i&s;ted in &s;acrifices and offerings, and was perform'd by the <HI>Jaouas,</HI> four times in the year, to wit, at the two &s;eed-times, and after the two harve&s;ts, upon the Mountain of <HI>Olaimi,</HI> with great pomp, and a general concour&s;e of all the Inhabitants of the &s;ix Provinces.</P>
<P>This Mountain of <HI>Olaimi</HI> is &s;eated, as we &s;aid before, in the Province of <HI>Bemarin,</HI> about a league di&s;tant from the Royal City of <HI>Melilot;</HI> but there is about another league of a&s;cent and winding from the foot of it, ere a man can get to the top of it: It is certainly one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and mo&s;t mira|culous Mountains in the world: Its figure is perfectly round, and the natural de&s;cent extream &s;teepy; but to facilitate the acce&s;s thereof to &s;uch as are to go up, they have cut a good broad way all about it, and there are here and there &s;everal re&s;ting places gain'd out of the Rock, like &s;o many neeches: All the circumference of it, from the foot to within two hundred paces of the top, is naturally planted with goodly trees of <HI>Saxafras, Cedar,</HI> and <HI>Cypre&s;s,</HI> and &s;everal others from which there i&s;&s;ue <HI>Ro&s;ins,</HI> and <HI>Aromatick gums,</HI> of a very delightful &s;cent: On the top of it there is a &s;pacious plain, &s;mooth and eaven all over, and &s;omewhat better than a league in compa&s;s; it is covered with a delightful green livery of a &s;hort and &s;mall gra&s;s, which is intermixt with Thyme, Marjoram, and other &s;weet &s;melling herbs: And it was upon the top of this Moun|tain,
<PB N="238" REF="133" MS="y">
and upon this plea&s;ant verdure that the people &s;tood, while the Prie&s;ts of the Sun performed the divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The place which &s;erv'd them for a Temple, is a large and &s;pacious Grott, or Cave, which is naturally cut in the Rock, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Mountain: It hath a va&s;t and large mouth, as the entrance of a magnificent Temple: As &s;oon as the Sun is ri&s;en, he darts his rays on that entrance, which hath before it a fair and &s;pacious &s;quare place, which a man would &s;ay were made by art in the Rock: And there it is that the <HI>Jaouas,</HI> the Prie&s;ts of the Sun, &s;tay expecting his ri&s;ing to begin their or|dinary Ceremonies on Fe&s;tival days. This Cave within is oval, two hundred foot in length, and proportionably broad: The Vault, which is naturally cut in the Rock, ri&s;es up circu|larly from the ground to about a hundred foot high: There is ju&s;t in the mid&s;t of it a great hole, or Lanthorn, which en|lightens it from the top of the Mountain: This Lanthorn is encompa&s;s'd with great &s;tones, laid clo&s;e together to prevent peoples falling in: The Vault on the in&s;ide is perfectly white, and the &s;urface cover'd with a certain <HI>Salt-peter,</HI> which a man might take for white Coral diverfy'd into &s;everal different figures; the whole compa&s;s of it is of the &s;ame lu&s;tre: The floor of it is al&s;o extreamly eaven and &s;mooth, as if it were all of one piece of marble. In fine, the greate&s;t ornament of this Temple con&s;i&s;ts in its perfect whitene&s;s: At the bottom of it there is a great Ba&s;in or Ci&s;tern, ju&s;t over again&s;t the entrance, which is full of a very clear water, which perpetually di&s;tilling out of the Rock, is receiv'd into that place. Ju&s;t in the mid|dle of this Temple, directly under the Lanthorn which en|lightens it, there is a great Altar all of one &s;tone, of a round figure, three foot in height from the floor, and &s;u&s;tain'd by a &s;hort pillar, which Altar and the Pede&s;tal &s;eem to have been cut out of the place where it &s;tands, that being in all probabi|lity a piece of a Rock which jutted out upon the floor of that miraculous Cave.</P>
<P>The Sacrifices which the <HI>Jaouas</HI> offered to the Sun, con&s;i&s;ted not in the effu&s;ion of mans blood, or that of &s;ome certain bea&s;ts; for they were of a per&s;wa&s;ion, that the Sun, giving life to all things, would not be pleas'd with a &s;ervice that &s;hould deprive tho&s;e creatures of the life which he had be&s;tow'd on them; but the Sacrifice con&s;i&s;ted only in Songs, which they had com|pos'd in honour of him, as al&s;o in the perfumes of certain aro|matical drugs, which they appointed to be burnt on his Altar, and in the offerings of garments, which the rich pre&s;ented by the hands of the Prie&s;ts, to be afterwards di&s;tributed among the poorer &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>All this Ceremony, which was performed four times a year, la&s;ted from Sun-ri&s;ing till noon, at which time the A&s;&s;embly was di&s;mi&s;s'd: The Prie&s;ts went up to the Mountain on the
<PB N="239" REF="133">
Eve of every Fe&s;tival, to prepare them&s;elves for that &s;olemn Action; and the people, which came thither from all the Pro|vinces, were there pre&s;ent &s;ome time before Sun-ri&s;ing. The way which led up to the Mountain was enlightned by great Fires, which were kept in all that Night, for the convenience of tho&s;e who went thither to adore. All the people remain'd without upon the Mountain, and none but the Prie&s;ts dur&s;t come neer the Grot, which &s;erv'd them for a Temple. Tho&s;e who brought any Garments to be di&s;tributed to the poor, pre&s;ented them to the Prie&s;ts who &s;tood at the entrance, and they hung them on the Poles which were on both &s;ides of the Portal, where they remained till after the Service, and then they were di&s;tributed among the poor, as were al&s;o the other pre&s;ents which the rich offered, and which were in like manner kept till the &s;ame time: Tho&s;e al&s;o who brought Perfumes to burn on the Altar, deliver'd their pre&s;ents to the Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Sun began to appear, the Prie&s;ts who &s;tood be|fore the Temple began their Songs and Hymns, adoring him &s;everal times on their knees; then they went one after another to ca&s;t the Incen&s;e and Perfume which they had in their hands upon the Fire, which they had before kindled on the Altar, as al&s;o upon a great Stone which &s;tood before the entrance of the Grot: This Ceremony being ended, the chiefe&s;t of the Prie&s;ts powr'd &s;ome Honey into a hollow Stone, made &s;omwhat like tho&s;e Stones wherein the Holy-water &s;tands in &s;ome places, which Stone &s;tood al&s;o before this Temple; and into another, which was of the &s;ame figure and the &s;ame matter, he put &s;ome corns of <HI>Turkey</HI>-wheat a little bruis'd, and de&s;titute of their outward Shell, as al&s;o &s;ome other &s;mall grains, which the Birds con&s;ecrated to the Sun, called the <HI>Tonatzuli,</HI> do greedily feed upon: The&s;e Birds, whereof there are great numbers in the Woods which lie round about this Mountain, were &s;o ac|cu&s;tomed to find the&s;e. Treatments which were prepar'd for them in that place, that they fail'd not to come there in great companies as &s;oon as the A&s;&s;embly was retir'd.</P>
<P>While the Prie&s;ts continu'd burning the perfume, and cele|brating the prai&s;es of the Sun, the People who were upon the Mountain having made &s;everal bowings at the ri&s;ing of the Sun, entertain'd them&s;elves afterwards in &s;ome kinds of recreation, dances, and &s;ongs, which they &s;ung in honour of him; and af|terwards &s;itting down on the gra&s;s, every one fell to what he had brought along with him for his <HI>Viaticum.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they continu'd there till noon; but when it came neer that time, the Prie&s;ts, quitting the gate of the Temple, went into the body of it, and di&s;po&s;ing them&s;elves about the Altar, which &s;tood in the mid&s;t, they began to &s;ing afre&s;h: Then as &s;oon as the Sun began to ca&s;t his golden beams on the border of the opening or Lanthorn, under which the Altar was ere|cted,
<PB N="240" REF="134" MS="y">
they put Incen&s;e and other perfumes upon the fire which they had kindled the night before, and very carefully kept in upon that Altar: Having ended their Songs, and con&s;um'd all their Perfumes, they all retir'd to the entrance of the Temple, before the Gate, excepting only &s;ix, who remain'd neer the Al|tar; and while tho&s;e who &s;tood at the entrance lift up their Voices more then ordinary, the others who remain'd at the Al|tar let go out of their hands, at the &s;ame time, every one &s;ix of the <HI>Tonatzuli,</HI> which they had brought thither, and kept in Cages for that purpo&s;e: The&s;e Birds having flown about the Temple, and finding the entrance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Prie&s;ts, who were at the Gate with Boughs in their hands, and frighted them with their Voices, took their flight out at the open place in the mid&s;t of the Temple; and after they had flown about a while, the A&s;&s;embly which was upon the Mountain entertain'd them with loud cries of rejoycing, as accounting them to have put a period to the Ceremony, and looking on them as the Children and Me&s;&s;engers of the Sun, they immediately got into the Woods.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e Birds were gone the people march'd down in order from the Mountain, and pa&s;&s;ing neer the Temple, the Prie&s;ts, who were &s;till in their Office, caus'd them to enter into it; and after they had wa&s;hed their hands and their faces in the Fountain, they order'd them to go out at the &s;ame en|trance, which was divided by a &s;mall partition, purpo&s;ely made there to prevent confu&s;ion and di&s;order: Then at their coming out they took another way, which led them into the Road that conducted to the Mountain, and was the &s;ame by which they had a&s;cended; and &s;o every one made towards his own home.</P>
<P>The poor, whereof the Prie&s;ts had a Catalogue, &s;taid till all the re&s;t were gone, and receiv'd from their hands the Gar|ments, and all the other Pre&s;ents which the rich had made to the Sun, to be di&s;tributed among them; which done, all left the Mountain, and there was an end of the Ceremony.</P>
<P>But now, &s;ince the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the people who are Inhabitants of the Provinces of <HI>Bemarin</HI> and <HI>Matica,</HI> and particularly the King and City of <HI>Melilot,</HI> have embraced the Chri&s;tian Religion, this Mountain and its Temple are not much frequented, unle&s;s it be out of curio&s;ity: Nor does the King permit his Subjects of the other Provinces, who have not receiv'd Bapti&s;m, to go up thither to perform their Sacrifices and all their ancient Super&s;titions.</P>
<P>They believ'd the immortality of the Soul; but they had &s;o di&s;guis'd this Truth with Fables, that it was in a manner &s;mother'd thereby. They embalm'd the bodies of their de|cea&s;ed Relations with &s;everal &s;orts of Gums and Aromatical Drugs, which had the virtue of pre&s;erving them from corrup|tion;
<PB N="241" REF="134" MS="y">
and after they had kept them &s;ometimes above a year in their hou&s;es, they buried them in their Gardens, or in the neighbouring Fore&s;ts, with great lamentations and ceremo|nies. They &s;hew to this day at the foot of the plea&s;ant Moun|tain of <HI>Olaimi,</HI> the Sepulchres of &s;everal of their Kings, which are cut in the Rock; there is planted before every one of them a fair Cedar, for the better ob&s;ervation of the place, and more exact continuance of their memories.</P>
<P>To make a greater expre&s;&s;ion of their mourning, and to &s;hew how much they bewail'd the death of their Friends and Kinred, they cut off &s;ome part of their hair; But when any King died they &s;hav'd the whole head, and &s;uffer'd not their hair to grow again, till they had bewail'd him for the &s;pace of fifteen months.</P>
<P>The Knowledge which the <HI>Apalachites</HI> have of God, they have attain'd to by &s;everal degrees: For, to go to the bottom of the bu&s;ine&s;s, it is about an Age &s;ince that the fir&s;t Seeds of Chri&s;tian Religion were &s;own in that part of <HI>Florida,</HI> by a <HI>French</HI> Colony con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality, which was brought thither and e&s;tabli&s;h'd there by one Captain <HI>Ri|bauld</HI> in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth King of <HI>France:</HI> The fir&s;t thing he did was to build a Fort, which he named <HI>Carolina,</HI> in honour of His Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty: He impos'd al&s;o on the Capes, Ports, and Rivers of that Country, the names they are at the pre&s;ent known by; &s;o that along the Coa&s;t a man finds a place called the <HI>Port Royal,</HI> the <HI>French Cape,</HI> the Rivers of <HI>Seine, Loyre, Charante, Garonne, Daufins, May, Somme,</HI> and &s;everal other pla|ces, which have ab&s;olute <HI>French</HI> names, and con&s;equently are a manife&s;t argument that the &s;aid Nation have heretofore had &s;ome command there.</P>
<P>But what is more worthy ob&s;ervation, and conduces more to our purpo&s;e, is, that at this fir&s;t Expedition for <HI>Florida,</HI> there went along with the Adventurers two Learned and Religious Per&s;ons, who immediately upon their arrival in the Country made it their bu&s;ine&s;s, by all &s;orts of good offices, to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the affections of the Inhabitants, and to learn their Language, that &s;o they might give them &s;ome knowledge of God, and the &s;acred my&s;teries of his Go&s;pel. The Memo|rials which Captain <HI>Ribauld</HI> left behind him as to that particu|lar, &s;hew how that the King <HI>Saturiova,</HI> who govern'd the Quarter where the <HI>French</HI> had e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves, and who had for Va&s;&s;als to him &s;everal little Kings and Princes who were his Neighbours, receiv'd tho&s;e Preachers very kindly, and recommended it to all his Subjects, that they &s;hould have a &s;ingular e&s;teem for them; &s;o that the affection tho&s;e poor peo|ple bore them, and the fidelity and zeal the others expre&s;s'd for the advancement of their Conver&s;ion, rais'd even then very great hopes that the work of the Lord would pro&s;per in their

hands, and that that little portion of his Vineyard being care|fully dre&s;s'd, would in time bring forth many good and preci|ous fruits, to the prai&s;e of his grace.</P>
<P>The&s;e happy beginnings and fir&s;t-fruits of the Go&s;pel of our Saviour <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> were afterwards augmented and advanc'd by the cares of Mon&s;ieur the Admiral <HI>de Coligny,</HI> who gave a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to one <HI>de Laudoniere,</HI> to carry over thither a con&s;ide|rable &s;upply of Soldiers and all &s;orts of Trade&s;men, which ar|riv'd in the year One thou&s;and five hundred &s;ixty and four: But the&s;e la&s;t Adventurers had hardly taken the air in the Country after their arrival thither, ere the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who ima|gines that all <HI>America</HI> belongs to him, and who hath ever been jealous of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, made his advantage of the di&s;|orders which were then in that Country, to traver&s;e the gene|rous de&s;igns of the Directors of that hopeful Colony, and &s;mother it as 'twere in the Cradle: To that purpo&s;e he &s;ent thither <HI>Peter Melandez</HI> with &s;ix great &s;hips full of men and am|munition, who fell upon it on the nineteenth of <HI>September,</HI> M D LXV.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Laudoniere</HI> and Captain <HI>Ribauld,</HI> who had not long before brought the Colony a &s;mall recruit of men, con|&s;idering that it would be madne&s;s to think to oppo&s;e &s;uch a powerful force, re&s;olv'd, with the advice of mo&s;t of the Offi|cers, to capitulate and deliver up the place to the &s;tronger party, upon &s;uch honourable conditions as people be&s;ieg'd are wont to demand. <HI>Peter Melandez</HI> granted them mo&s;t of the Articles they had propos'd; but a&s;&s;oon as he was got into the Fort, and had &s;ecur'd the Guards, he broke the promi&s;e he had made them, and violating the Law of Nations, he cru|elly ma&s;&s;acred not only the Soldiery, but al&s;o all the women and children, whom he found within the place, and who could not make their e&s;cape by flight.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Ribauld</HI> fell in the Ma&s;&s;acre; but <HI>de Laudoniere</HI> made a &s;hift to e&s;cape, through the Fenns, to the &s;hips newly come from <HI>France,</HI> which by good fortune were &s;till in the Road: Some others of the Inhabitants, who, upon the fir&s;t arrival of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had fore&s;een the danger likely to fall upon them, got in time into the woods, and in the night time came to the Village of their good friend <HI>Saturiova,</HI> who, hating the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> gave them protection, and &s;upply'd them with provi&s;ions for a competent &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, till the year M D LXVII. when Captain <HI>de Gorgues,</HI> coming to <HI>Florida</HI> with three &s;tout &s;hips full of re&s;olute men and all &s;orts of Ammu|nition, &s;everely puni&s;hed the cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Saturiova,</HI> and all his Neighbours and Allies, he reveng'd the publick injuries of the <HI>French,</HI> putting to the &s;word all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> he met with, not only in the Fort of <HI>Carolina,</HI> which they had repair'd and fortified after their u&s;ur|pation

of it, but al&s;o tho&s;e he found in two other Forts which they had built along the Coa&s;t, which he burnt and demoli&s;h'd, as may be &s;een in the xii. Chapter of the fourth Book of the De&s;cription of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> writ by <HI>John de Laet.</HI></P>
<P>The Memorials which Captain <HI>de Gorgues</HI> cau&s;ed to be printed, giving an account of his Expedition into <HI>Florida,</HI> tell us of a certain <HI>French-man</HI> named <HI>Peter du Bre,</HI> who having made his e&s;cape to King <HI>Saturiova,</HI> to avoid the cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> related to him, that there e&s;caped of that Ma&s;&s;a|cre but ten men, of which number he was one; that they all met with a &s;afe retreat in the territories of the &s;aid Prince, who liv'd not far from their de&s;olated Colony; that three of the e&s;caped per&s;ons dy'd there &s;ome months after that defeat; that of the &s;even remaining, there were &s;ix were &s;o charm'd with the advantageous relation which the &s;ubjects of <HI>Saturiova</HI> made to them daily of the Trea&s;ures of King <HI>Mayra,</HI> of the powerfulne&s;s of another who&s;e name was <HI>Ollaca,</HI> who com|manded forty Princes, and of the genero&s;ity and prudent conduct of the King of <HI>Apalacha,</HI> who govern'd many fair and large Provinces &s;eated at the foot of the Mountains, and reaching into &s;everal delightful Vales which they encom|pa&s;s'd; that they importun'd <HI>Saturiova,</HI> who had entertain'd them &s;o kindly, that he would be pleas'd to allow them guides, to conduct them to the Frontiers of the Kingdom of the la&s;t named, of whom they had heard &s;o many miracles, and had particularly this recommendation, that he was a lover of Strangers, and that his Subjects were the mo&s;t civilly govern'd of all the Septentrional part of <HI>America;</HI> that <HI>Saturiova,</HI> wil|ling to add that favour to all tho&s;e they had receiv'd from him before, gave them a good convoy, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t vali|ant of his &s;ubjects, to conduct them with all &s;afety to all his Allies, and to the Dominions of the King of <HI>Apalacha,</HI> if they were de&s;irous to vi&s;it him.</P>
<P>The relation of the &s;ucce&s;s of this Progre&s;s, which the&s;e few <HI>French-men</HI> undertook to &s;atisfie their curio&s;ity, and to make the be&s;t u&s;e they could of this interval of their misfortune, a&s;|&s;ures us, that after they had vi&s;ited <HI>Athorus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Satu|riova,</HI> and mo&s;t of his Allies, who had their Villages all along a delightful River which in their Language they call <HI>Seloy,</HI> to avoid meeting any of the &s;ubjects of <HI>Timagoa,</HI> who was then engag'd in a War again&s;t <HI>Saturiova,</HI> there was a nece&s;&s;ity they &s;hould cro&s;s Rivers upon boughs of trees fa&s;ten'd together, climb up Mountains, and make their way through Fens and thick Fore&s;ts, where they met with &s;everal cruel bea&s;ts; that before they came within the Dominions of the King of <HI>Apala|cha,</HI> they were many times &s;et upon by Troops of Savages, who &s;cout up and down among tho&s;e va&s;t de&s;arts; that two of their Guides were kill'd in tho&s;e encounters, and mo&s;t of the re&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="136">
dangerou&s;ly wounded; that the &s;ubjects of King <HI>Timagoa,</HI> ha|ving ob&s;erv'd their march, had follow'd them for &s;everal days, and not being able to overtake them, they laid ambu&s;hes for them, thinking to have met with them in their return; that after they had run through abundance of dangers, and many times endur'd much hunger and thir&s;t, they got at la&s;t to the Province of <HI>Matica,</HI> which is under the juri&s;diction of the King of <HI>Apalacha;</HI> that the Governor of the City of <HI>Akoveka,</HI> which is the Metroprolis of that Country, caus'd them to be brought to the King, who was then gone to vi&s;it the Province of <HI>Amana;</HI> that that Prince entertain'd them with &s;o much kindne&s;s, and expre&s;s'd &s;o much friend&s;hip towards them, that they re&s;olv'd to &s;end back their Guides into their Country, and to &s;etle them&s;elves among&s;t the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> &s;ince they found them an&s;werable to the account they had received of them.</P>
<P>The remembrance of the dangers they had run through ere they could get into the Province of <HI>Matica;</HI> the lively appre|hen&s;ion they had of the difficulties which were unavoidable in their return; the little hope there was that the <HI>French</HI> would ever undertake the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their Colony; the plea&s;antne&s;s and fertility of the Country into which divine Providence had brought them; and the good natures of the Inhabitants, be&s;ides &s;everal other con&s;iderations, prevail'd with them to re&s;olve on that &s;etlement. But the Guides whom <HI>Saturiova</HI> had given them, ob&s;tructed their re&s;olution &s;o much, and &s;o earne&s;tly remon&s;trated to them, that they dur&s;t not pre|&s;ent them&s;elves before their Lord without them, that to com|po&s;e the difference, and prevent the reproach they were afraid of at their return into their own Country, they prevail'd &s;o far, that two of tho&s;e Travellers &s;hould come back along with them to <HI>Saturiova,</HI> to te&s;tifie their care and fidelity in the exe|cution of the Commi&s;&s;ion he had given them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Relation adds further, that tho&s;e four <HI>French-men</HI> who voluntarily &s;tay'd among the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> being well in|&s;tructed in the ways of God, left them &s;ome knowledge of his Sovereign Maje&s;ty: And the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who have &s;ome years &s;ince found the way into tho&s;e Provinces, write, that the Inhabi|tants of the Province of <HI>Bemarin</HI> do &s;till talk of tho&s;e &s;tran|gers, and it is from them that they have learnt &s;everal words of the <HI>French</HI> Language, &s;uch as are among others tho&s;e that &s;ignifie God, Heaven, Earth, Friend, the Sun, the Moon, Para|di&s;e, Hell, Yea, No. Be&s;ides which there are many other words common among tho&s;e people, and are us'd by them to expre&s;s the &s;ame thing which they &s;ignifie in <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>After the death of all the&s;e <HI>French-men,</HI> who were very much lamented by all the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> excepting only the Prie&s;ts of the Sun, who bore them an irreconcileable hatred, becau&s;e they turned the People from Idolatry, and inclined

them to the knowledge of the true God who created the Sun, whom they adored as God, the Provinces which are &s;eated in the Vales of the <HI>Apalachaean</HI> Mountains, and had been en|lightned but by a very weak ray of coele&s;tial light, would ea|&s;ily have returned to the darkne&s;s of their ancient &s;uper&s;tition, if God, by a remarkable di&s;po&s;al of his Providence, had not &s;ent to them &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, which at their arrival thither blew up that little &s;park, which lay hid under the embers, into a weak flame.</P>
<P>The&s;e Families came out of <HI>Virginia</HI> in the year M DC XXI. with an intention to go to <HI>New-England,</HI> to avoid the frequent incur&s;ions and ma&s;&s;acres committed there by the Savages; but the wind proving contrary to their de&s;ign, they were ca&s;t on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Florida,</HI> whence they pa&s;s'd into the Province of <HI>Matica,</HI> and thence into tho&s;e of <HI>Amana</HI> and <HI>Bemarin,</HI> and in the la&s;t they &s;etled them&s;elves, and have drawn thither a con&s;iderable number of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and per&s;ons of quality, who have there laid the foundations of a &s;mall Colony. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are retir'd into tho&s;e places &s;o remote from all commerce in the world, undertook that generous de&s;ign, in the mid&s;t of the great revolutions which happen'd in <HI>England</HI> during the late troubles, and the main bu&s;ine&s;s they propos'd to them&s;elves at that time, was only to make their advantage of &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a retreat, that they might the more &s;eriou&s;ly, and with le&s;s di&s;traction, mind the attainment of their own &s;al|vation, and dilate the limits of Chri&s;tianity among tho&s;e poor people, if God gave them the means.</P>
<P>We under&s;tand al&s;o by the la&s;t papers that have been &s;ent us from <HI>America,</HI> that, God ble&s;&s;ing the endeavours of the fir&s;t In|habitants of this &s;mall Colony, they have within the&s;e twelve or thirteen years baptiz'd mo&s;t of the Officers and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Heads of Families in the Provinces of <HI>Bemarin</HI> and <HI>Amana;</HI> That at the pre&s;ent, they have a Bi&s;hop and many learned and zealous Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks among them, who carry on the work of the Lord; and the more to advance it, they have built Colledges in all tho&s;e places where there are Churches, that the Children of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> may be in&s;tructed in the my&s;teries of Chri&s;tian Religion and true piety.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Papers add further, that though the King of <HI>Apa|lacha</HI> hath received Bapti&s;m, and &s;eems to have much affection for the&s;e Strangers, who have procur'd him that happine&s;s; yet hath he of late entertain'd &s;ome jealou&s;ie of them, out of an apprehen&s;ion, as it was repre&s;ented to him by &s;ome of his Councel, that if he &s;uffer'd them to grow more numerous, they might in time become Ma&s;ters of the Country: He thereupon in the fir&s;t place di&s;pers'd them into &s;everal Cities, that they might not be able to make any con&s;iderable body, or foment any factions; and afterwards, there was an order pa&s;s'd, that
<PB N="246" REF="137">
all tho&s;e who have at the pre&s;ent any &s;etlement in the bo&s;om of his Country, might peaceably continue in their habitati|ons, and participate of the &s;ame priviledges with the Natives, provided they held no corre&s;pondence with any abroad, to the prejudice of the publick tranquillity; but that hencefor|ward no other &s;trangers &s;hall be permitted to make any fur|ther e&s;tabli&s;hments there.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the Nature of the Country, affirm, that the King of the <HI>Apalachites</HI> hath no ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear that either the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or any other &s;trangers &s;hould be guilty of any de&s;ign again&s;t him, as to the ma&s;tering of his Country: For, be&s;ides the nece&s;&s;ity there is of having a very powerful Army, ere any &s;uch enterpri&s;e can be undertaken, and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who are e&s;tabli&s;h'd there, are no more among&s;t that great Nation, than a handful of &s;and on the Sea|&s;ide; this Country being &s;o remote from all the re&s;t of the world, and de&s;titute of Gold, Silver, precious Stones, and in a manner all rich Commodities, whereby Commerce is kept up and continu'd; it is mo&s;t certain, that it will never be much &s;ought after or envy'd by any <HI>Europaean</HI> Nations, which &s;end out Colonies only to tho&s;e places, where there is hope of ma|king &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage by way of Trade. Where|to may be added this further con&s;ideration, that, though the&s;e Provinces were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of as great Trea&s;ures and Rarities, as they are de&s;titute thereof; yet lying at a great di&s;tance from Sea-Ports, and having no navigable Rivers falling into it, by means whereof there might in time be &s;ome corre&s;pondence between them and other parts, there is no likelihood that there &s;hould be many per&s;ons either in <HI>England</HI> or any where el&s;e, who would be per&s;waded to cro&s;s over &s;o many Seas, to go and end their days in a Country which is de&s;titute of all tho&s;e conveniences, and cannot receive tho&s;e refre&s;hments which are brought out of <HI>Europe,</HI> and contribute much to the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of all the other Colonies of <HI>America;</HI> and in a word, a Country, which can give its Inhabitants no|thing but clothing and nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Some time after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves in this Country, as we have repre&s;ented before, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (who as it were keep the keys of one part of <HI>Florida,</HI> by means of the Forts they have built near the mo&s;t eminent Havens, and along the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Rivers) brought in there a com|pany of religious men of the Order of the <HI>Minimes,</HI> whom Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the eighth had &s;ent into the Septentrional <HI>America,</HI> in the quality of <HI>Apo&s;tolical Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> and endow'd with mo&s;t ample priviledges, for their better encouragement in the carrying on of that work: They arriv'd in tho&s;e Provinces in the year, One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred forty and three; and &s;ince that time they have taken their progre&s;s through mo&s;t of

<P>When the&s;e religious men return from their Mi&s;&s;ions, they live in a &s;olitary, yet delightful place, which lies upon the de&s;cent of a high Mountain, not above a quarter of a league di&s;tant from the great Lake, and about as much from the greate&s;t Village of the Province of <HI>Achalaca.</HI> Before a man comes to their habitation, he mu&s;t cro&s;s through &s;everal fair Gardens, in the mid&s;t whereof there is a plea&s;ant walk, plant|ed with trees on both &s;ides, which reaches to the skirt of the Mountain: And though they have &s;eated them&s;elves on an eminent place, yet they have many &s;prings, which, falling down from the upper part of the Mountains, are receiv'd into great Ci&s;terns and great Ponds, where they have abundance of good Fi&s;h: The Lord of the Country vi&s;its them often, and hath a great re&s;pect for them; for the mo&s;t part, he hath &s;ome one of them about his per&s;on, who &s;erves him as a Chap|lain.</P>
<P>In the year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty and three, in which Mr. <HI>Brigstock,</HI> that mo&s;t inqui&s;itive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, from whom we have receiv'd all the account we have given of the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> arriv'd in that Province of <HI>Achalaca,</HI> the fore|mention'd Religious men entertain'd him very kindly, and did him all the good offices lay in their power: From them it was, that, during his aboad in the Country, he learnt all the particulars we are now going to de&s;cribe, and which he hath liberally communicated to us.</P>
<P>They &s;how'd him an admirable Flower, which grows abun|dantly in the Mountains of tho&s;e parts: The figure of this Flower is much like that of a Bell, and there are as many co|lours ob&s;ervable in it as in the Rain-bow; the under leaves, which being fully blown, are much larger than tho&s;e of our greate&s;t Ro&s;es, are charged with a great many other leaves, which appear &s;till le&s;s and le&s;s to the lower part or bottom of the Bell: Out of the mid&s;t of them there ri&s;es a little button, like a heart, which is of a very delicious ta&s;te: The Plant hath a little bu&s;hine&s;s at the top, much like Sage: The leaves and the flower &s;mell like a Violet: It is al&s;o a kind of &s;en&s;itive Plant, for it cannot be touch'd, either in its leaves or flower, but it immediately withers.</P>
<P>The&s;e Religious men carryed the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman to a Village of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who inhabit in the Mountains, where there is a miraculous Grott or Cave, wherein the waters have fa&s;hion'd all the mo&s;t delightful rarities, that a man can de&s;ire from a diverti&s;ment of that kind: They &s;hew'd him particu|larly

<P>There is found in the Mountains, on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Pro|vince of <HI>Achalaca,</HI> &s;ome Rock-Chri&s;tal, and certain red and bright &s;tones, which have &s;uch a lu&s;tre as that they might pa&s;s for right Rubies: 'Tis po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;ome Copper|mines in tho&s;e parts; but they are not yet di&s;covered, only what confirms this opinion is, that they find a kind of golden &s;and there, which is wa&s;h'd down by the torrents, and hath a wonderful lu&s;tre: Mr. <HI>Brig&s;tock</HI> having given of it to &s;ome Gold&s;miths to make a te&s;t thereof, it was in a manner quite con|&s;um'd by the fire, and the little that remained in the Crucible might well pa&s;s for very fine Copper.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ame Religious men &s;hew'd the &s;aid Gentleman, as they pa&s;s'd through the woods, &s;everal &s;orts of trees which yielded Gums of excellent &s;cent, as al&s;o many other Rarities, a particular account whereof would require a con&s;iderable Vo|lume: But above all, they &s;how'd him the tree, whereof the <HI>Floridians</HI> make that excellent drink which they call <HI>Ca&s;ina,</HI> the de&s;cription whereof may be &s;een in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>de Laet.</HI> It is ab&s;olutely conformable to the Relation of Mr. <HI>Brig&s;tock.</HI></P>
<P>Before the Inhabitants of <HI>Achalacha</HI> were converted to Chri|&s;tianity, they took &s;everal Wives; but now their Marriages are regulated, and they content them&s;elves only with one: They interr'd their Lords as the <HI>Apalachites</HI> do, in the Caves that are at the foot of the Mountains: then they made up the entrance thereof with a &s;tone-wall: they hung before the Cave the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ve&s;&s;els which tho&s;e Princes had made u&s;e of at their Tables: And all the Captains fa&s;ten'd all about the place, their Bows, Arrows, and Clubs, and mourn|ed for &s;everal days at the Sepulchre: They wor&s;hipped the Sun, and held the immortality of the Soul as well as their Neighbours: They believ'd al&s;o that &s;uch as had liv'd well, and &s;erv'd the Sun as they ought, and made many pre&s;ents to the poor, in honour of him, were hapyy, and that after death they were chang'd into Stars: But on the contrary, that tho&s;e who had led a wicked life, were carried into the precipices of the high Mountains, whereby they were &s;urrounded, and there endur'd extream want and mi&s;ery, among&s;t the Lions, Tygers, and other bea&s;ts of prey, which hunt after their &s;u&s;tenance therein.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Country are all long-liv'd, in&s;omuch that there are many among them, both men and women, who are neer two hundred years of age.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Bodies of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and their Ornaments.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now to re-a&s;&s;ume our former di&s;cour&s;e, and re|turn from <HI>Florida</HI> to the <HI>Caribby-I&s;lands,</HI> to con&s;ider there, with all the exactne&s;s imaginable, what concerns tho&s;e Inhabitants thereof on whom we intend to be&s;tow the remain|ing part of this Hi&s;tory, and particularly what relates to their Bodies, Minds, Di&s;po&s;itions, Manners, Religion, Cu&s;toms, and other remarkable occurrences concerning the &s;avage <HI>Caribbi|ans</HI> or <HI>Cannibals,</HI> of who&s;e origine we have already given &s;o large an account.</P>
<P>And whereas &s;ome of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> who inhabit in the &s;ame I&s;lands wherein the <HI>French</HI> and other <HI>Europaean</HI> Nations have planted <HI>Colonies,</HI> or at lea&s;t come often among them, accom|modate them&s;elves in many things to their manner of life, and that they may be the more kindly received by them, they quit many of their old Cu&s;toms; tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to be ac|quainted with the ancient manners of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> are not to learn them of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> who live in <HI>Martinico,</HI> or tho&s;e who conver&s;e mo&s;t with the <HI>Europaeans;</HI> but from tho&s;e of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> who of all others have held lea&s;t corre&s;pondence with any Forreigners: It is accordingly from them that we have re|ceiv'd what we &s;hall hereafter relate concerning the <HI>Caribbi|ans:</HI> But before we enter into the relation, we &s;hall make &s;ome general ob&s;ervations, to prevent the a&s;toni&s;hment which the Reader might conceive at the difference there is between the account we give of them, and what he may receive from others, either by word of mouth or writing.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is to be acknowledged a thing almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible, that the Relations of Countries and Cu&s;toms at &s;o great a di&s;tance from us, &s;hould agree in all things, e&s;pecially &s;ince we find that tho&s;e of neighbouring Countries are for the mo&s;t part differing among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ince the <HI>Caribbians</HI> be|came familiar, and have conver&s;ed with forreign Nations, they have remitted much of their ancient Cu&s;toms, and quited many
<PB N="250" REF="139">
things which they practis'd before with an inviolable &s;trictne&s;s: So that there may be &s;een in them now a remarkable change from what they were heretofore: That the ca&s;e &s;tands thus with them now, is to be attributed partly to the conver&s;ation of the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> who in &s;ome things have oblig'd them to abate &s;omewhat of their originary &s;implicity, and in others have made them wor&s;e than they were, as to our own &s;hame we cannot but acknowledge: Hence it comes that Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Montel</HI> tells us in his Relations, that two ancient <HI>Caribbians,</HI> con&s;idering that degeneration of their Country-men, took oc|ca&s;ion to entertain him with a di&s;cour&s;e to this purpo&s;e: <Q>Our people are become in a manner like yours, &s;ince they came to be acquainted with you; and we find it &s;ome difficulty to know our &s;elves, &s;o different are we grown from what we have been heretofore: It is to this alteration that our peo|ple attribute the more frequent happening of <HI>Hurricanes</HI> than they were ob&s;erv'd to be in the days of old; and conclude thence, that <HI>Maboya</HI> (that is to &s;ay, the evil &s;pirit) hath reduc'd us under the power of the <HI>French, Engli&s;h, Spaniards</HI> and others, who have driven us out of the be&s;t part of our Country.</Q></P>
<P>Thirdly, it is po&s;&s;ible they may have different Cu&s;toms, according to the diver&s;ity of the I&s;lands, though they all make up but one people; as may be ob&s;erved in the diver&s;ity of the Cu&s;toms of one and the &s;ame Kingdom, according to the &s;e|veral Quarters and Provinces of it: Whence it may have pro|ceeded, for example, that tho&s;e that have conver&s;ed mo&s;t at <HI>Dominico</HI> will give an account of the Opinions, Cu&s;toms, and Ceremonies of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> much different from what &s;hall be related thereof by tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;hall have frequented other places; and yet the Relations of either &s;ide &s;hall be true.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as in the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who inhabit a good way within the Country, and con&s;equent|ly &s;eldom &s;ee any forreigners, retain much more of their anci|ent Cu&s;toms, and their old cour&s;e of life, than tho&s;e who living neer the <HI>Dutch</HI> Colonies of <HI>Cayenna</HI> and <HI>Berbica,</HI> drive on an ordinary trade with the Chri&s;tians; &s;o among our <HI>Caribbians,</HI> the Inhabitants of the I&s;lands, tho&s;e who conver&s;e lea&s;t with the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> &s;uch as are tho&s;e of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s, are more &s;trict ob&s;ervers of their ancient cour&s;e of life, than are, for exam|ple, tho&s;e of <HI>Martinico</HI> or <HI>Dominico,</HI> who are oftner &s;een among them.</P>
<P>Fifthly, thence it proceeds that tho&s;e per&s;ons who have &s;een them only in the&s;e la&s;t mentioned places, or have heard of them only from &s;uch as have been acquainted with them only in tho&s;e places, will haply find many things in the pro&s;ecution of our Hi&s;tory, which may cla&s;h with the Relations they had recei|ved of them from others; which if they do, they are not to won|der
<PB N="251" REF="139" MS="y">
thereat, &s;ince mo&s;t of our Ob&s;ervations relate to the <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> of St. <HI>Vincents.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, we de&s;ire our Readers to take this further adver|ti&s;ement, that it is our de&s;ign to give a de&s;cription of the anci|ent Manners and Cu&s;toms of the&s;e <HI>Caribbians,</HI> to the end that no body may think it &s;trange, if their pre&s;ent demeanour be not in all things an&s;werable thereto: The&s;e adverti&s;ements be|ing thus premis'd, we proceed to give the Reader &s;atisfaction con&s;equently to the title of this Chapter.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e people whom we call <HI>Barbarians</HI> and <HI>Savages,</HI> have &s;ome thing hideous and deformed or defective, either in their Countenances or &s;ome other part of the body, as Hi|&s;torians affirm of the <HI>Maldive&s;es,</HI> the Inhabitants about the <HI>Magellane &s;treights,</HI> and &s;everal others which we need not name here.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> are a hand&s;ome well-&s;hap'd people, well proportion'd in all parts of their bodies, gracefull enough, of a &s;miling countenance, middle &s;tature, having broad &s;houlders, and large buttocks, and they are mo&s;t of them in good plight, and &s;tronger than the <HI>French:</HI> Their mouths are not over large, and their teeth are perfectly white and clo&s;e: True it is their complexion is naturally of an Olive-colour, and that colour &s;preads even into the whites of their Eyes, which are black, &s;omewhat little like tho&s;e of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> but very piercing: Their foreheads and no&s;es are flat, not naturally, but by artifice: For their mothers cru&s;h them down at their birth, as al&s;o continually during the time they &s;uckle them, imagining it a kind of beauty and perfection; for were it not for that, their no&s;es would be well &s;hap'd, and they would have high foreheads as well as we: They have large and thick feet, becau&s;e they go barefoot, but they are withall &s;o hard, that they defie Woods and Rocks.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e of the Country a man cannot meet with any wanting either one or both eyes, lame, crook-back'd, or bald, or having any other deformity naturally; as is in like manner affirmed of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> the <HI>Floridians,</HI> and mo&s;t Nations of<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery c. 8.</NOTE> <HI>America;</HI> whereas tho&s;e who have walked through <HI>Grand</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyage de Breves.</NOTE> <HI>Cairo</HI> relate, That in the Streets they have met with many one|eyed, and many &s;tark blind people; tho&s;e infirmities being &s;o frequent and &s;o popular in that Country, that of ten per&s;ons five or &s;ix are &s;ubject thereto: But if any among the <HI>Caribbi|ans</HI> are thus deformed, or have lo&s;t, or are maimed in any limb, it hapned in &s;ome Engagement again&s;t their Enemies; and &s;o tho&s;e &s;cars or deformities being &s;o many demon&s;trations of their Valour, they glory in them; &s;o far are they from being in any danger of mi&s;chief, or being ca&s;t into a furnace by their Coun|try-men, as tho&s;e poor Children were among the people of <HI>Guyana,</HI> and among the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> in the time of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="140" MS="y">
who came out of their Mothers wombs imperfect and deformed. Nay, there are &s;ome hand&s;om Maids and Women among&s;t the Savage <HI>Caribbians,</HI> witne&s;s <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Ro&s;selan,</HI> wife to the Governour of <HI>Saintalou&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Caribbians</HI> are black-hair'd, as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut. Hi&s;t. Chin. l. 1. c. 8.</NOTE> for that rea&s;on are &s;ometimes call'd the <HI>Black-hair'd</HI> People: The hair of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> is not curl'd or frizzled, as that of the <HI>Moors,</HI> but &s;treight and long, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Maldive&s;es:</HI> And the Women attribute the highe&s;t perfection of Beauty to this black colour, as to what concerns the hair. It is reported<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garcila&s;&s;o, l. 8. c. 13.</NOTE> al&s;o, That the <HI>Indian</HI> Women of <HI>Peru</HI> are &s;o enamour'd of black hair, that to make their own of that colour by artifice, when Nature does it not, they are willing to endure incredible pains and torments: On the contrary, in <HI>Spain</HI> many Ladies, to make their hair &s;eem to be of a golden yellow colour, per|fume it with <HI>Sulphur,</HI> &s;teep it in <HI>Aqua-fortis,</HI> and expo&s;e it to the Sun in the heat of the day, nay in the very Dog-days: And in <HI>Italy</HI> the &s;ame colour is much affected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> are very careful in combing them&s;elves, and they think it commendable &s;o to do: They anoint their hair with Oil, and have certain Receipts to advance the growth thereof: The Women commonly comb their Husbands and their Children: Both Men and Women tie up their hair to|wards the hinder part of the head, winding it about &s;o as that it &s;tands up like a horn on the Crown; on both &s;ides they leave locks hanging down like &s;o many Mu&s;tachioes, according to natural liberty. The Women part their hair &s;o as that it falls down on both &s;ides of their heads; but the men part theirs the quite contrary way, &s;o as that one half falls down behind, the other before, which obliges them to cut off the fore-part of it, otherwi&s;e it would fall down over their eyes: This they did heretofore with certain &s;harp Herbs, before they had the u&s;e of Sci&s;&s;ers; not to mention, that they were al&s;o accu&s;tomed to cut off their hair when they were in mourning; whereas on the contrary, in <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> the Men never cut off their hair, but the Women &s;have it clear off; a cu&s;tom contrary to that of tho&s;e people among whom S. <HI>Paul</HI> liv'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> &s;eem not to have any Beards at all, but as &s;oon as they grow they pluck them off by the roots, as the <HI>Bra|&s;ilians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carpin in Bergeron.</NOTE> the <HI>Cumane&s;es,</HI> and certain Nations &s;ubject to the Em|pire of the <HI>Tartars</HI> do, who have always an iron in&s;trument in their hands, wherewith they pluck out the hair of their Beards as &s;oon as they come out: But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> are &s;eldom &s;een to put them&s;elves to that trouble, in&s;omuch that it is conceiv'd they have a &s;ecret to prevent the growth of hair when it is once gotten off; an invention which would have been of great con|venience to the ancient <HI>Romans:</HI> For it is affirm'd, that they would not &s;uffer their Beards to grow till after the time of the
<PB N="253" REF="140" MS="y">
Emperour <HI>Adrian,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;uffer'd his to grow; before that time it was thought among them &s;o honourable a thing to wear no beard, that there was a prohibition made that Slaves &s;hould not &s;have theirs: The &s;ame prohibition extended al&s;o to all per&s;ons charg'd with any Crime, as it were to &s;et a mark of infamy on them, till &s;uch time as they were clear'd, as <HI>Aul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">L. 3. c. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Gellius</HI> affirms; which proceeding was contrary to what is pra|ctis'd in the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Territories, who cau&s;es the Beard to be &s;haven, as a mark of ignominy: In the year One thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred fifty two, that hapned to the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> being charg'd with having done &s;ome unhand&s;om things in his Employment; his Beard had &s;uch a natural graceful curl, and was of &s;o fair a flaxen colour, that &s;ome Turks would have given him a con&s;iderable &s;um of money for it, and kept it for a Rarity; but he cho&s;e rather to bring it along with him into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> wonder very much to &s;ee our <HI>Europeans</HI> &s;uf|fer their Beards to grow &s;o long, and think it a great defor|mity to wear any, as they account it a perfection in them&s;elves to have none; but they are not the only Savages who are fan|ta&s;tick in matter of gracefulne&s;s and beauty: All barbarous Nations, nay &s;ome that are civiliz'd, are wedded to their par|ticular &s;entiments, as to that point: For in&s;tance, among the<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is af|firmed by di|vers Hi&s;tori|ans, too ma|ny to be cited&punc;</NOTE> <HI>Maldive&s;es</HI> it is accounted an accompli&s;hment of Beauty to have the body all over hairy, which among us would be thought more becoming a Bear then a Man: Among the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> to have a little narrow forehead, and that full of hair: Among the <HI>Japone&s;es,</HI> not to have any hair at all; whence it comes, that they are ever employ'd in the plucking of it off, leaving only a little tuft on the crown of the head: Among the <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> Women it is thought a piece of Beauty to be flat-nos'd, but to heighten the attractions of their no&s;es, they rub them with a very black unguent: Among the Inhabitants of <HI>Guinny</HI> they make the &s;ame account of great nails and flat no&s;es; and thence it comes that a&s;&s;oon as the children are come into the world, they cru&s;h down their no&s;es with their thumbs, as do al&s;o the <HI>Bra&s;ilians:</HI> Among tho&s;e of the Province of <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> and &s;ome oriental Inhabitants of the <HI>Indies,</HI> as al&s;o among the <HI>Calecutians,</HI> and the <HI>Malabars,</HI> it is thought very graceful to have extraordinary large ears, hanging down over their &s;houlders; in&s;omuch that &s;ome among them u&s;e divers artifi|ces to make them &s;uch: Among the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> great lips and a skin black as Jet, are thought beautiful: The Negroes of <HI>Mosambico</HI> are extreamly pleas'd to have their teeth very &s;harp, &s;o that &s;ome u&s;e Files to make them &s;uch: Among the <HI>Maldive&s;es</HI> they are no le&s;s de&s;irous to have them red, and to that end, they are continually chewing of <HI>Petel:</HI> Among the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Cumane&s;es,</HI> they are indu&s;trious to have
<PB N="254" REF="141" MS="y">
them black, and they purpo&s;ely make them &s;uch: And among the latter, it is accounted beauty to have a long face, lean cheeks, and exce&s;&s;ively big legs: And hence it is that they &s;queeze the heads of their children between two cu&s;hions as &s;oon as they are born, and that after the example of the Inha|bitants about the River of <HI>E&s;&s;equebe,</HI> they bind the legs very hard a little below the knee, and a little above the ankle, that &s;o the calf may &s;well: Among &s;ome <HI>Peruvians,</HI> to have the face cut and chequer'd, as it were with Lancets, and to have flat and broad heads, huge foreheads, and the head very narrow from the forehead to the nape of the neck, is accounted beau|tiful: And to reduce it to this comely &s;hape, they kept their childrens heads pre&s;s'd between two thin boards, from the time of their birth till they were four or five year old. To be &s;hort, among &s;ome oriental Nations, and &s;ome <HI>Africans,</HI> it is account|ed a great perfection in the Women, to have their brea&s;ts hanging down over their &s;houlders; and among the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> it is the principal part of beauty to have the foot extreamly little and thin; and the better to have it &s;o, while they are yet children they bind their feet &s;o hard, that they are in a manner lam'd, and it is with much ado that they are able to &s;tand: It were a hard matter to make a de&s;cription of beauty, according to the different opinions of all the&s;e nations: But to return to the <HI>Caribbians.</HI></P>
<P>They go &s;tark-naked, both men and women, as many other Nations do: And if any one among them &s;hould endeavour to hide the privy parts, all the re&s;t would laugh at it: Though the Chri&s;tians have conver&s;ed very much among them, yet have all the per&s;wa&s;ions that have hitherto been u&s;ed to induce them to cover them&s;elves been to no purpo&s;e: And whereas &s;ometimes, when they come to vi&s;it the Chri&s;tians, or to treat with them, they have comply'd &s;o far with them, as to cover them&s;elves, by putting on a &s;hirt, drawers, a hat, and &s;uch cloaths as had been given them, yet a&s;&s;oon as they were re|turn'd to their own habitations, they &s;trip them&s;elves, and put up all in their Clo&s;ets, till &s;ome &s;uch other occa&s;ion &s;hould ob|lige them to put them on again: To requite this compliance of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> &s;ome among the <HI>French,</HI> having occa&s;ion to go among them, made no difficulty to &s;trip them&s;elves after their example: This defiance of cloaths reigns in all places under the Torrid Zone, as every one knows.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are reproach'd with their nakedne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vin. Le Blanc. par. 3. c. 16.</NOTE> they reply, that we came naked into the world, and that it were a mad thing for us to hide the bodies be&s;towed on us by na|ture.

<PB N="255" REF="141" MS="y">
participate of that commendation, for they were wont to co|ver them&s;elves when they came to be marriageable, and &s;o|lemnized that action with great rejoicing: But now that cu|&s;tome is abrogated, for that poor Nation hath been utterly de|&s;troy'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or carryed away and made &s;laves to work in the Mines, and there are not in any of the I&s;lands known under that name, any of the natural Inhabitants, but only &s;ome few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who were tran&s;ported thither out of the I&s;land of <HI>Bermudez.</HI> But come we to the Ornaments of our Savages.</P>
<P>They change their natural colour by dying their bodies with &s;ome compo&s;ition which makes them red all over: For living neer Rivers and Springs, the fir&s;t thing they do every morn|ing is to go and wa&s;h them&s;elves all over: And this was the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de mor. German.</NOTE> practice of the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> affirms. A&s;&s;oon as the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have wa&s;h'd them&s;elves, they return to their hou&s;es, and drie them&s;elves by a little fire; being dry'd, the Wife, or &s;ome one of the hou&s;hold takes a gourd full of a cer|tain red compo&s;ition which they call <HI>Roucou,</HI> from the name of the tree which produces it, and whereof we have given an ac|count in its proper place in the precedent Book: With this colour mixt with oil, they rub the whole body and the face; the better to apply this paint, they make u&s;e of a &s;punge in|&s;tead of a Pencil; and to appear more gallant, they many times make black circles about the eyes, with the juice of <HI>Ju|nipa</HI> Apples.</P>
<P>This red painting &s;erves them both for Ornament and for a Covering; for be&s;ides the Beauty they imagine to them&s;elves therein, they affirm that it makes them more &s;upple and active; which may be the more likely to be true, for that the ancient Wre&s;tlers were wont to rub them&s;elves with oil for the &s;ame end: They affirm further, That by rubbing them&s;elves thus with <HI>Roucou,</HI> they &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the coldne&s;s of the night and rains, the &s;tinging of the <HI>Me&s;quitos</HI> and the <HI>Marin|goins,</HI> and the heat of the Sun, which otherwi&s;e would cau&s;e ri&s;ings and ulcers in the skin. This Unction hardens their skins, and withal gives it an extraordinary lu&s;tre and &s;moothne&s;s, as all know who have &s;een and felt them.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Savages do thus paint and trick up them&s;elves after a &s;trange manner; but they do not all u&s;e the &s;ame colours, nor ob&s;erve the &s;ame fa&s;hion: For there are &s;ome who paint their Bodies all red, as our Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> do; as for<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is af|firmed by di|vers Hi&s;tori|ans.</NOTE> in&s;tance, tho&s;e of the <HI>Cape de Lopes Gon&s;alvez;</HI> but others make u&s;e of other colours, as Black, White, Che&s;tnut, Gingioline, Blew; Yellow, and the like. Some u&s;e only one particular co|lour; others paint them&s;elves with &s;everal colours, and repre|&s;ent divers figures on their bodies: Some others, without apply|ing any colour, rub them&s;elves all over with the oil of Palm|trees:
<PB N="256" REF="142" MS="y">
Some anoint them&s;elves with the oil of Balm, and then ca&s;t on it a &s;mall powder, which &s;eems as if it were the filings of Gold. In fine, there are &s;ome who anoint their bodies with a glewy oil, and blow on that the downe or &s;malle&s;t Feathers of divers Birds; or haply they cover them&s;elves with a kind of gummy pa&s;te, which is of a very &s;weet &s;cent, and fa&s;ten there|on the mo&s;t delightful Flowers growing in their Country. There is &s;ufficient choice of all the&s;e modes; and it were a plea&s;ant &s;ight to &s;ee a company of the&s;e Morris-dancers dancing together. We might add thereto, to make the diverti&s;ement the more compleat, tho&s;e <HI>Turki&s;h Pilgrims</HI> who commonly go in long Garments made of thou&s;ands of pieces of all &s;orts of co|lours.</P>
<P>But this is to be noted, That the painting of the body is a very ancient kind of Ornament; and among other Monuments of this piece of Antiquity, <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Herodian</HI> affirm, that cer|tain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 22. c. 1. In the life of Severus.</NOTE> people of <HI>Great Brittany,</HI> not u&s;ing any kind of cloathing, painted their bodies with divers colours, and repre&s;ented there|on the figures of certain living Creatures, whence they were called <HI>Picti,</HI> that is, Painted people. But among all the Sava|ges who at this day paint them&s;elves, the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have this advantage, that they adorn them&s;elves with a colour which the Ancients honour'd mo&s;t of any; for it is reported, that the <HI>Goths</HI> made u&s;e of Vermilion to make their faces red; and the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> affirms, painted their bodies with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib 33. c. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Minium</HI> upon the day of their Triumph; and he particularly tells us that <HI>Camillus</HI> did &s;o: and he further adds, that upon Fe&s;tival days they &s;o painted the face of the Statue of their <HI>Jupiter;</HI> and that heretofore the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> made &s;o great ac|count of this Vermilion colour, that their principal Lords ap|ply'd it all over their bodies, and that their Gods wore it in their Images.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Caribbians</HI> do for the mo&s;t part content them&s;elves with this ordinary dre&s;s of red painting, which &s;erves them in&s;tead of Shirts, Cloths, Cloaks and Coats: But on &s;olemn days and times of publick rejoicing, they add to the red divers other colours, &s;preading them fanta&s;ticallly over the face and the whole body.</P>
<P>But this kind of painting is not the only ornament in u&s;e among them; they adorn the crown of the head with a little Hat made of birds feathers, of different colours, or with a Plume of <HI>Herons</HI> feathers, or tho&s;e of &s;ome other Bird: They al&s;o &s;ometimes wear a crown of feathers, which covers their heads, &s;o that there may be &s;een among them a great many crowned heads, though there be no Kings: And yet they may be better look'd upon as Kings with their feather Crowns, than the Lord of the Gulf of <HI>Antongil</HI> be taken for a Sovereign Prince, when he hath for his Scepter and the badge of his
<PB N="257" REF="142" MS="y">
Royal dignity, but a great Gardiner's Pruning-hook, which he always carries about him.</P>
<P>The women among the <HI>Maldeve&s;es,</HI> make about a dozen holes in each ear, at which they fa&s;ten little gilt nails, and &s;ometimes Pearls and Precious Stones: The Ladies of <HI>Mada|ga&s;car</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> make a hole as big as that a man may thru&s;t his thumb through it in the lower part of the ear, at which they hang pendants of wood and bone: And the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> under the reign of their Kings the <HI>Yncas,</HI> were accu&s;tomed to make in their ears a hole of an incredible bigne&s;s, at which they fa&s;tened chains of a quarter of an Ell in length, with Pendants of Gold at the bottom, of an extraordinary big|ne&s;s: But our <HI>Caribbians&punc;</HI> are content with a &s;mall hole, accor|ding to the <HI>European</HI> mode, in the &s;ofte&s;t part of the ear, through which they put the bones of certain Fi&s;hes very &s;mooth, pie|ces of that kind of <HI>Tortoi&s;e</HI> &s;hells which they call <HI>Carets;</HI> and &s;ince the Chri&s;tians came among them, Buckles of Gold, Sil|ver, Latten, at which they hang very fair Pendants: They know how to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e that are right and the counterfeit, but they are mo&s;t taken with &s;uch as are made of Chry&s;tal, Amber, Coral, or &s;ome other rich material, provi|ded the buckle, and all the other workman&s;hip be of Gold: Some have endeavoured to put upon them &s;uch as were only Copper gilt, and would have per&s;waded them they were Gold; but they refu&s;ed them, &s;aying that they intended to de|ceive them, and that it was but <HI>Kettle-gold:</HI> and to make a tryal thereof, they were wont to put them into their mouths: So great is their experience in the&s;e things beyond tho&s;e of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> who when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming thither in the year MDC XLV. offered them a Silver-&s;poon, put it between their teeth, and finding it was hard refus'd it, de&s;iring one of Tin: Whence it may ea&s;ily be imagined what account they made of Tin, &s;ince they gave a young maid in exchange for a Spoon of that mettal. <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirms that heretofore among the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> Copper was in better e&s;teem than Gold, the u&s;e whereof was &s;o vile, that they bound Malefactors with chains of Gold.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> do &s;ometimes al&s;o make holes through their lips, and put through them a kind of little Bodkin, which is made of the bone of &s;ome bea&s;t or fi&s;h: Nay they bore through the &s;pace between the No&s;trils, that they may hang there &s;ome Ring, a grain of Chry&s;tal, or &s;ome &s;uch toy: The necks and arms of our <HI>Caribbians</HI> have al&s;o their re&s;pective ornaments; for they have their Neck-laces and Bracelets of Amber, Coral, or &s;ome other glittering material: The men wear Bracelets on the brawny part of the arm, neer the &s;houlder; but the wo|men wear theirs about the wri&s;ts: They adorn al&s;o their legs with Chains of <HI>Ra&s;&s;ada,</HI> in&s;tead of Garters: Tho&s;e among
<PB N="258" REF="143">
them who have no acquaintance with the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> commonly wear about their necks Whi&s;tles made of the bones of their enemies, and great chains made of the teeth of <HI>Agoutys,</HI> Ty|gers, wild Cats, or little &s;hells bor'd through and fa&s;ten'd toge|ther with a thread of fine Cotton of a red or violet colour. And when they would make the greate&s;t &s;how they can, they add to all this a kind of Caps, certain Bracelets, which they fa&s;ten under their armpits, Scarfs, and Girdles of Feathers ve|ry indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;pos'd together by a delightful intermixture, which they &s;uffer to hang down over their &s;houlders, or from the navel to the middle of the thigh.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all their Ornaments, are cer|tain large Medals of fine Copper extreamly well poli&s;hed, with|out any graving on them, which are made after the figure of a cre&s;cent, and enchac'd in &s;ome kind of &s;olid and precious wood&punc; the&s;e in their own language they call <HI>Caracolis:</HI> They are of different largene&s;s, for there are &s;ome &s;o &s;mall that they hang them at their ears like Pendants, and others about the bigne&s;s of the palm of a mans hand, which they have hanging about their necks, beating on their brea&s;ts: They have a great e&s;teem for the&s;e <HI>Caracolis,</HI> a&s;well by rea&s;on the material whereof they are made, which never contracts any ru&s;t, gli&s;ters like Gold, as that it is the rare&s;t and mo&s;t precious booty they get in the incur&s;ions they make every year into the Country of the <HI>Arou|agues</HI> their Enemies; and that it is the livery or badge, where|by the Captains and their Children are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the ordinary &s;ort of people: Accordingly tho&s;e who have any of the&s;e jewels make &s;o great account of them, that when they die, they have no other inheritance to leave their Children and intimate Friends: Nay there are &s;ome among them who have of the&s;e <HI>Caracolis</HI> which had been their Grandfathers, wherewith they do not adorn them&s;elves but on extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The women paint the whole body, and adorn them&s;elves much after the &s;ame manner as the men do, excepting only tho&s;e differences we have mentioned before, and that they wear no Crowns on their heads: There is this al&s;o particular|ly ob&s;ervable in them, that they wear a kind of buskins, which fall no lower than the ankle: This kind of ornament is very neatly wrought, and edg'd above and below with a certain intertexture of ru&s;hes and cotton, which lying &s;treight on the calf of the leg makes it &s;eem more full.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Certain Remarks upon the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Language.</HEAD>
<P>IT is our intention at the end of this Hi&s;tory, for the &s;atisfaction of the more curious Reader, to add a large Vo|cabulary of the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Language; and therefore, in this Chapter, we &s;hall only make &s;ome principal remarks upon it, &s;uch as may in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;cover the grace, the &s;mooth|ne&s;s, and the proprieties thereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Caribbians</HI> have an ancient and natural Language, &s;uch as is wholly peculiar to them, as every Nation hath that which is proper to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. But be&s;ides that ancient Language, they have fram'd ano|ther ba&s;tard-&s;peech, which is intermixt with &s;everal words taken out of forreign Languages, by the commerce they have had with the <HI>Europaeans:</HI> But above all they have borrowed many words of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for they were the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians that came among them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Among them&s;elves, they alwaies make u&s;e of their anci|ent and natural Language.</P>
<P N="4">4. But when they have occa&s;ion to conver&s;e or negotiate with the Chri&s;tians, they always make u&s;e of their corrupt Language.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ides that, they have al&s;o a very plea&s;ant intermixture of words and expre&s;&s;ions when they would undertake to &s;peak in &s;ome forreign Language: As for example, when they u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion to the <HI>French,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Compere Governeur,</HI> that is, Go&s;&s;ip Governour, u&s;ing the word <HI>Compere</HI> generally to|wards all tho&s;e who are their Friends or Allies: In like manner they would &s;ay, without any more ceremony, <HI>Compere Roy,</HI> that is, Go&s;&s;ip, or Friend King, if there were any occa&s;ion to do it: It is al&s;o one of their ordinary complements to the <HI>French,</HI> when they &s;ay with &s;miling countenance, <HI>Ah &s;i toy bon pour Caraibe, moy bon pour France, If thou art good for the</HI> Caribbian, <HI>I am good for</HI> France: And when they would com|mend, and expre&s;s how much they are &s;atisfy'd with tho&s;e of the &s;ame Nation, they &s;ay, <HI>Mouche bon France pour Caraibe,</HI> France <HI>is very good for the</HI> Caribbian; they &s;ay al&s;o, <HI>Maboya mouche fache contre Caraibe,</HI> Maboya <HI>doth much again&s;t the</HI> Ca|ribbian, when it thunders, or in a Hurricane; and, <HI>Moy mouche Lunes, I have lived many Moons,</HI> to &s;ignifie that they are very ancient: They have al&s;o the&s;e words often in their mouths, when they find that the <HI>French</HI> would abu&s;e their &s;implicity, <HI>Compere, toy trompe Caraibe, Friend thou deceive&s;t the</HI> Caribbian:
<PB N="260" REF="144" MS="y">
And they are often heard to &s;ay when they are in a good hu|mour, <HI>Moy bonne Caraibe, I am an hone&s;t</HI> Caribbian.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet is it to be ob&s;erv'd, that though the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of all the I&s;lands do generally nnder&s;tand one another, yet is there in &s;everal of them &s;ome dialect different from that of the others.</P>
<P N="7">7. There is no great u&s;e made of the letter <HI>P.</HI> in their Lan|guage; but that only excepted, there is no want of letters, as there is in the Language of <HI>Japan, Bra&s;eel</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> which want the letters <HI>F. L. R.</HI> Or in that of <HI>Peru,</HI> wherein <HI>B. D. F. G. J.</HI> con&s;onant and <HI>X</HI> are wanting, as Hi&s;torians affirm.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Language of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> is extreamly &s;mooth, and for the mo&s;t part pronounced with the lips, &s;ome few words with the teeth, and in a manner nothing at all from the throat. For though the words we &s;hall &s;et down hereafter, &s;eem to be rough, as they are written, yet when they pronounce them, they make eli&s;ions of certain letters, and give &s;uch an air thereto as renders their di&s;cour&s;e very delightful to the ear: Whence it came, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur du Montel</HI> hath given this te&s;ti|mony of them: <Q>I took great plea&s;ure, &s;aid he, in hearkning unto them when I was among them, and I could not &s;uffici|ently admire the grace, the fluency, and the &s;weetne&s;s of their pronunciation, which they commonly accompany with a lit|tle &s;miling, &s;uch as takes very much with tho&s;e who conver&s;e with them.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Caribbians</HI> who are Inhabitants of the I&s;lands have a &s;weeter pronunciation than tho&s;e of the Continent: but otherwi&s;e they differ only in a dialect.</P>
<P N="10">10. By the &s;ame word, according as it is diver&s;ly pronounced they &s;ignifie &s;everal things: For example, the word <HI>Anhan</HI> &s;ig|nifies, 1. <HI>Yes,</HI> 2. <HI>I know not,</HI> 3. <HI>Thine,</HI> or <HI>take it,</HI> according to the pronunciation that is given it.</P>
<P N="11">11. The <HI>Europaeans</HI> cannot pronounce the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Lan|guage with the grace and fluency natural thereto, unle&s;s they have learnt it very young.</P>
<P N="12">12. They hear one another very patiently, and never in|terrupt one the other in their di&s;cour&s;e: But they are wont to give a little hem at the end of every three or four periods, to expre&s;s the &s;atisfaction they have to hear what is &s;poken.</P>
<P N="13">13. What advantage &s;oever the <HI>Europaeans</HI> may imagine they have over the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> either as to the natural faculties of the mind, or the ea&s;ine&s;s of pronunciation of their own Lan|guages, in order to the more ea&s;ie attainment of theirs, yet hath it been found by experience, that the <HI>Caribbians</HI> do &s;ooner learn ours than we do theirs.</P>
<P N="14">14. Some among the <HI>French</HI> have ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Carib|bians</HI> have a kind of aver&s;ion for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue, nay &s;o far, that &s;ome affirm they cannot endure to hear it &s;poken
<PB N="261" REF="144">
where they are, becau&s;e they look on them as their Enemies. And whereas there are in their corrupt Language many words taken out of the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> a people whom they al&s;o account their Enemies, it proceeds hence, that they learn'd them during the time they held a fair corre&s;pondence with that Nation, and be|fore they began to treat them as they afterwards did.</P>
<P N="15">15. They are very &s;hie in communicating their Language, out of a fear the &s;ecrets of their Wars might be di&s;covered; nay, tho&s;e among them who have embrac'd the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, would not be per&s;waded to reveal the grounds of their Language, out of a belief it might prejudice their Nation.</P>
<P N="16">16. We &s;hall here &s;et down &s;ome of the mo&s;t particular proprieties of their Language: In the fir&s;t place, the men have many expre&s;&s;ions proper only to them&s;elves, which the wo|men under&s;tand well enough, but never pronounce: And the women have al&s;o their words and phra&s;es, which if the men &s;hould u&s;e they would be laugh'd at; whence it comes, that in this Di&s;cour&s;e one would think the women &s;poke a Language dif|ferent from that of the men, as will be &s;een in our Vocabulary, by the difference of expre&s;&s;ions which the men and women make u&s;e of to &s;ignifie the &s;ame thing: The Savages of <HI>Domi|nico</HI> affirm, that it proceeds hence, that when the <HI>Caribbians</HI> came to inhabit the&s;e I&s;lands, they were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a Nation of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> whom they ab&s;olutely de&s;troy'd, &s;ave only the Women, whom they married for the re-peopling of the Country; &s;o that tho&s;e Women having retain'd their own Lan|guage, taught it their Daughters, and brought them to &s;peak as they did; which being practis'd to the pre&s;ent by the Mo|thers towards their Daughters, their Language came to be different from that of the Men in many things: But the male Children, though they under&s;tand the &s;peech of their Mothers and Si&s;ters, do neverthele&s;s imitate their Fathers and Brethren, and accu&s;tom them&s;elves to their Language when they are five or &s;ix years old. To confirm what we have &s;aid concerning the cau&s;e of this difference of Language, it is alledg'd, That there is &s;ome conformity between the Language of the <HI>Aroua|gues</HI> who live in the Continent, and that of the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Wo|men: But it is to be ob&s;erv'd, That the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Con|tinent, as well Men as Women, &s;peak the &s;ame Language, as having not corrupted it by inter-marriages with &s;trange Wo|men.</P>
<P N="17">17. The old men have al&s;o &s;ome terms particular to them|&s;elves, and certain affected expre&s;&s;ions, not at all us'd by the younger &s;ort of people.</P>
<P N="18">18. The <HI>Caribbians</HI> have al&s;o a certain Language which they make u&s;e of only among them&s;elves, when they entertain any warlike Re&s;olutions; it is a very hard kind of fu&s;tian-language: The Women and Maids know nothing of that my&s;terious Lan|guage,
<PB N="262" REF="145" MS="y">
nor yet the young Men, till they have given &s;ome a&s;&s;u|rances of their genero&s;ity, and the zeal they have for the com|mon Quarrel of their Nation again&s;t their Enemies: This is to prevent the di&s;covery of their de&s;igns before the appointed time.</P>
<P N="19">19. For the variation of their Ca&s;es, Per&s;ons, Moods, and Genders, they have no di&s;tinct particles as we have, but they lengthen their words by certain &s;yllables or letters at the begin|ning or end of the word, and &s;ometimes by the change of the letters: Thus they &s;ay in the Imperative, <HI>Bayoubaka, Go;</HI> but in the Indicative, <HI>Nayoubakayem,</HI> I go: In like manner, <HI>Babinaka,</HI> dance; <HI>Nabinakayem,</HI> I dance; much like the formation of the Hebrew Verbs.</P>
<P N="20">20. Indefinite and ab&s;olute Nouns are not much in u&s;e among them, e&s;pecially the names of the parts of the body; but they are always in a manner re&s;train'd to a fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third per&s;on.</P>
<P N="21">21. The fir&s;t per&s;on is commonly expre&s;s'd by the Letter N; at the beginning of a word, as <HI>Nichic, my Head;</HI> the &s;econd by a B, as <HI>Bichic, thy Head;</HI> and the third by an L, as <HI>Lichic, his Head.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. The neuter and ab&s;olute Gender is expre&s;s'd by a T, as <HI>Tichic, the Head;</HI> but this is not much in u&s;e.</P>
<P N="23">23. They have different names in &s;peaking to per&s;ons when they are pre&s;ent, and others when they &s;peak of them; thus they &s;ay <HI>Baba,</HI> Father, &s;peaking to him, and <HI>Youmaan,</HI> &s;peaking of him; <HI>Bibi,</HI> Mother, &s;peaking to her, and <HI>Ichanum,</HI> &s;peaking of her; which, with the difference there is between the Language of the Men and the Women, the young and the old, their or|dinary Di&s;cour&s;e, and that us'd by them when they are engag'd in Military Deliberations, mu&s;t needs cau&s;e a great multiplica|tion of words in their Language.</P>
<P N="24">24. Their proper Names are many times deriv'd from certain Accidents, as we &s;hall &s;ee more particularly in the Chapter of the Birth and Education of their Children.</P>
<P N="25">25. They never name any one when the party is pre&s;ent; or at lea&s;t, out of re&s;pect, they do but half name him.</P>
<P N="26">26. They never pronounce the whole Name of either Man or Woman; but they do tho&s;e of Children; &s;o that they will &s;ay, the Father or Mother of &s;uch a one; or el&s;e they &s;ay half the Name; as for in&s;tance, <HI>Mala,</HI> in&s;teed of &s;aying <HI>Mala|kaali,</HI> and <HI>Hiba</HI> for <HI>Hibalomon.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Di&s;po&s;itions of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and their Manners.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Caribbians</HI> are naturally of a pen&s;ive and melancho|ly temperament, fi&s;hing, &s;loth, and the temperature of the air contributing much to the continuance of that humour: but having found by experience, that that uncomfortable con|&s;titution was prejudicial to their health, and that the mind ore-pre&s;s'd dries up the bones, they for the mo&s;t part do &s;o great violence to their natural inclination, that they appear chearful, plea&s;ant, and divertive in their conver&s;ation, e&s;peci|ally when they have got a little wine in their heads: Nay they have brought them&s;elves to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that, as the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery c. 12</NOTE> they can hardly endure the company of &s;uch as are melancho|ly: and tho&s;e who have conver&s;ed much with them have al|waies found them very facetious, and loth to let &s;lip any occa|&s;ion of laughing, without making their advantage of it: nay &s;ometimes they have bur&s;t out into laughter, at what the mo&s;t inclin'd thereto among us would hardly have &s;mil'd.</P>
<P>Their di&s;cour&s;es among them&s;elves are commonly concern|ing their hunting, their fi&s;hing, their gardening, or &s;ome other innocent &s;ubjects; and when they are in &s;trange company, they are never troubled if any body laugh in their pre&s;ence, &s;o far are they from thinking it done as any affront to them: And yet, they are &s;o far from the &s;implicity of a certain Nation of <HI>New-France,</HI> who acknowledge them&s;elves to be <HI>Savages,</HI> not knowing what that denomination &s;ignifies, that they think them&s;elves highly injur'd when any one gives them that name:
<PB N="266" REF="147" MS="y">
for they under&s;tand what the word means, and &s;ay that term belongs only to the wild bea&s;ts, the Inhabitants of the woods: Nor do they take it well to be called <HI>Cannibals,</HI> though they eat the fle&s;h of their Enemies, which they &s;ay they do to &s;a|tisfie their indignation and revenge, and not out of any deli|cacy they find in it more than in any thing el&s;e whereby they are &s;u&s;tain'd: But they are extreamly pleas'd when any one calls them <HI>Caribbians,</HI> becau&s;e it is a name they pride them|&s;elves much in, as being a certain acknowledgment of their ge|nero&s;ity and courage: For they are not only the <HI>Apalachites,</HI> from among&s;t whom they came, who by that word &s;ignifie a <HI>Warlike and valiant man,</HI> endu'd with force and a particular dexterity in military affairs; but even the <HI>Aronagnes</HI> them&s;elves their irreconcileable Enemies, having often experienc'd their valour, under&s;tand thereby the &s;ame thing, though by the &s;ame word they would al&s;o denote a <HI>Cruel per&s;on,</HI> by rea&s;on of the mi&s;eries the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have occa&s;ioned them. But howere it be, this is certain, that our Savages of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> are &s;o much plea&s;ed with that name, that &s;peaking to the <HI>French</HI> they have this perpetually in their mouths, <HI>Toy Francois, moy Caraibe, Thou art a</HI> French-man, <HI>I am a</HI> Caribbian.</P>
<P>In all other things they are of a good and tractable di&s;po&s;i|tion; and they are &s;o great Enemies to &s;everity, that if the <HI>Europaean</HI> or other Nations who have any of them &s;laves (as among others the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have &s;ome, cunningly trapan'd and carryed away by them from the places of their birth) treat them with any rigour, they many times die out of pure grief: But by fair means they will do any thing, contrary to the <HI>Ne|groes,</HI> who mu&s;t be roughly dealt with, otherwi&s;e they grow in&s;olent, &s;lothful, and perfidious.</P>
<P>They commonly reproach the <HI>Europaeans</HI> with their avarice, and their immoderate indu&s;try in getting of wealth together for them&s;elves and their Children, &s;ince the earth is able to find &s;ufficient &s;u&s;tenance for all men, if &s;o be they wil take ever &s;o little pains to cultivate it: as for them&s;elves, they &s;ay they are not perplex'd with caring for tho&s;e things whereby their lives are pre&s;erv'd; and indeed it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that they are incomparably fatter, and have their health better than tho&s;e that fare deliciou&s;ly: Mo&s;t certain it is, that they live without ambition, without vexation, without di&s;quiet, having no de|&s;ire of acquiring honours or wealth, &s;lighting Gold and Silver, as the ancient <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> and the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> and content|ing them&s;elves with what Nature had made them, and what the earth &s;upplies them withall for their &s;u&s;tenance: And when they go a hunting, or a fi&s;hing, or root up trees for ground to make a little Garden, or to build hou&s;es, which are innocent employments, and &s;uitable to the nature of man, they do all without eagerne&s;s, and as it were by way of diverti&s;ement and recreation.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="147" MS="y">But it rai&s;es a particular a&s;toni&s;hment in them when they &s;ee how much we e&s;teem Gold, con&s;idering we are &s;o well furni&s;h'd with Gla&s;s and Chry&s;tal, which in their judg|ment are more beautiful, and con&s;equently ought to be more highly prized: To this purpo&s;e, <HI>Benzoni</HI> a <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> Hi&s;torian, relates a &s;trange &s;tory of the New-world, how that the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> dete&s;ting the in&s;atiable avarice of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who &s;ub|du'd them, took a piece of Gold in their hands, and &s;aid, <Q>Be|hold the God of the Chri&s;tians; for this they come from <HI>Ca|&s;teel</HI> into our Country; for this they have made us &s;laves, ba|ni&s;h'd us out of our habitations, and committed horrid things again&s;t us; for this they are engag'd in wars among&s;t them|&s;elves; for this they kill one the other; for this they are alwaies in di&s;quiet, they quarrel, rob, cur&s;e and bla&s;pheme: In fine, there is no villany, no mi&s;chief but they will commit for this.</Q></P>
<P>In like manner, our <HI>Caribbians,</HI> when they &s;ee the Chri&s;tians &s;ad and perplext at any thing, are wont to give them this gen|tle reprehen&s;ion: ``<HI>Compere</HI> (a word they have learnt of the <HI>French,</HI> and commonly u&s;e to expre&s;s their affection, as the wo|men do al&s;o call our <HI>Europaeans Commeres,</HI> as a mark of their friend&s;hip; both words &s;ignifying in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Go&s;&s;ip, or familiar friend) <Q>how mi&s;erable art thou, thus to expo&s;e thy per&s;on to &s;uch tedious and dangerous Voyages, and to &s;uffer thy &s;elf to be orepre&s;s'd with cares and fears! The inordinate de&s;ire of acquiring wealth puts thee to all this trouble, and all the&s;e inconveniences; and yet thou art in no le&s;s di&s;quiet for the Goods thou ha&s;t already gotten, than for tho&s;e thou art de&s;i|rous to get: Thou art in continual fear le&s;t &s;ome body &s;hould rob thee either in thy own Country or upon the Seas, or that thy Commodities &s;hould be lo&s;t by &s;hipwrack, and devour'd by the waters: Thus thou growe&s;t old in a &s;hort time, thy hair turns gray, thy forehead is wrinkled, a thou&s;and incon|veniences attend thy body, a thou&s;and afflictions &s;urround thy heart, and thou make&s;t all the ha&s;te thou can&s;t to the grave: Why art thou not content with what thy own Coun|try produces?</Q> Why do&s;t not thou contemn riches as we do?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part. 3. c. 16.</NOTE> And to this purpo&s;e, the great Traveller <HI>Vincent le Blanc</HI> hath a remarkable di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Bra&s;ilians:</HI> <Q>That wealth which you Chri&s;tians pur&s;ue with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, do they any way promote your advancement in the grace of God?

<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> have this further reproach to make to the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> to wit, that of their u&s;urpation of their Country, and they &s;tick not to do it as a manife&s;t inju&s;tice: <Q>Thou ha&s;t driven me, <HI>&s;ays this poor people,</HI> out of St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers, Mevis, Mont&s;errat, St. Martins, Antego, Gardeloupe, Barbou|thos,</HI>

<HI>St. Eu&s;tace's, &amp;c.</HI> neither of which places belonged to thee, and whereto thou coulde&s;t not make any lawful pre|tence: And thou threatne&s;t me every day to take away that little which is left me: What &s;hall become of the poor mi&s;e|rable <HI>Caribbian?</HI> Mu&s;t he go and live in the Sea with the fi&s;hes? Thy Country mu&s;t needs be a wretched one, &s;ince thou leave&s;t it to come and take away mine: Or thou mu&s;t needs be full of malice, thus to per&s;ecute me out of a frolick.</Q> This complaint may well exempt them from the opprobrious denomination of Savages.</P>
<P><HI>Lycurgus</HI> would not permit his Citizens to travel, out of a fear they might learn the manners of forreign Countries: But our Savages &s;tand in need of much travel to unbarbarize them|&s;elves, if we may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion: And yet they are not only free from that in&s;atiable covetou&s;ne&s;s, which makes the Chri&s;tians undertake &s;o great and &s;o dangerous voyages, but al&s;o from the curio&s;ity of &s;eeing any other Country in the world, as being enamoured of their own more than any other. And thence it comes, that, imagining we &s;hould not be more curious than they are, nor le&s;s lovers of our Countries, they are a&s;toni&s;h'd at our Voyages; wherein they have the honour to be like <HI>Socrates,</HI> of whom <HI>Plato</HI> gives this te&s;timony, that he had no more de&s;ign to leave <HI>Athens,</HI> with any intention to travel, than the lame and the blind; and that he de&s;ired not to &s;ee other Cities, nor to live under other Laws; being, as to this particular, as far as our <HI>Caribbians,</HI> from the opinion of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> among whom it is come into a Proverb, that he who hath not travell'd the world may be compared to a Bear.</P>
<P>But we are to note further, that our <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the I&s;lands have not only an aver&s;ion from travelling into any other parts of the world, but they would not al&s;o willingly &s;uffer any of theirs to be carried away into a &s;trange Country, without an ab&s;olute promi&s;e within a &s;hort time to bring them back again: But if it happens through &s;ome misfortune that any one of them dies by the way, there is no thinking of any return among them, for there is no hope of reconciliation.</P>
<P>But if they have no curio&s;ity for things at a great di&s;tance from them, they have much for tho&s;e that are neerer hand, in|&s;omuch that if a man open a che&s;t in their pre&s;ence, he mu&s;t &s;hew them all that is in it, otherwi&s;e they will think them&s;elves di&s;-obliged: And if they like any thing of what they &s;ee therein, though it be of ever &s;o little value, they will give the mo&s;t precious thing they have for it, that &s;o they may &s;atisfie their inclination.</P>
<P>As concerning Traffick, true it is, that having treated about &s;omething, they will fall off from what they have promi&s;ed: But the &s;ecret to make them &s;tand to their bargain, is to tell
<PB N="269" REF="148" MS="y">
them, that a Merchant ought to be as good as his word: For when they are pre&s;s'd upon in point of honour, and reproached with incon&s;tancy as if they were children, they are a&s;hamed of their lightne&s;s.</P>
<P>Theft is accounted a great crime among&s;t them; wherein it mu&s;t be acknowledged they &s;hew them&s;elves more rational<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pluta. in his Life.</NOTE> than <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who allowed that vice in the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> children, as a very commendable employment, provided they did their bu&s;ine&s;s cleaverly, and Hocus-pocus-like: But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have &s;o natural and &s;o great an aver&s;ion for that &s;in, that there is no &s;uch thing found among them, which is very rare among <HI>Savages:</HI> For mo&s;t of them are Theeves; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;lands of Robbers.</NOTE> thence it is that &s;ome of their I&s;lands have their name thence.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> as they are are not of their own na|ture any way inclined to thieving, &s;o they live without any di|&s;tru&s;t one of another: So that their Hou&s;es and Plantations are left without any body to look to them, though they have neither doors nor inclo&s;ures, after the &s;ame manner as &s;ome Hi|&s;torians relate of the <HI>Tartars:</HI> But if the lea&s;t thing in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carpins Travels into Tartary.</NOTE> world be taken from them, &s;uch as may be a little knife, where|with they do &s;trange things in Joyner's work, they &s;o highly prize what is u&s;eful to them, that &s;uch a lo&s;s is enough to &s;et them a weeping, and grieving for the &s;pace of eight days after it, nay will engage them in combinations with their friends to get reparations, and to be reveng'd on the per&s;on whom they &s;u&s;pect guilty of the theft: Accordingly in tho&s;e I&s;lands where they have their habitations neer tho&s;e of the Chri&s;ti|ans, they have often revenged them&s;elves of tho&s;e who had, as they &s;aid, taken away any of their little hou&s;hould-&s;tuff: And in tho&s;e places when they find &s;omething wanting in their hou|&s;es, they pre&s;ently &s;ay, <HI>Some Chri&s;tian hath been here:</HI> And among the grievances and complaints which they make to the Governours of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, this comes alwaies in the front, <HI>Compere Governour, thy Mariners</HI> (&s;o they call all the forreign Inhabitants) <HI>have taken away a knife out of my Cot,</HI> or &s;ome other piece of hou&s;hold-&s;tuff of that kind. The Inha|bitants of <HI>Guinny</HI> would not make any &s;uch complaints: For if they chance to lo&s;e &s;omething, they are of a per&s;wa&s;ion that &s;ome of their decea&s;ed Relations, having occa&s;ion for it in the other world, came and took it away.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> are a people as it were a&s;&s;ociated in one com|mon intere&s;t, and they are of all people the mo&s;t loving one to another; being in that particular far from the humour of tho&s;e <HI>A&s;taticks</HI> of <HI>Java,</HI> who &s;peak not to their own Brothers without a dagger in their hands, &s;o di&s;tru&s;tful are they one of another: From this affection which our Savages mutually bear one another, does it proceed that there are few quarrels and animo&s;ities among them.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="149">But if they are once injur'd, either by a Stranger or one of their own Countrymen, they never forgive, but contrive all the waies they can to be revenged: Thus when any of tho&s;e Impo&s;ters, whom they call <HI>Bogez,</HI> makes them believe that one of tho&s;e whom they account Sorcerers is author of the mi&s;chief that hath happened to them, they endeavour all they can to kill him, &s;aying, <HI>Yaraliatana, he hath bewitched me; Ne|banebouibatina, I will be revenged of him:</HI> And this furious pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;ire to be revenged, is that which makes them &s;o bruti&s;h, as we &s;aid before, as to eat the very fle&s;h of their Enemies, whereof we &s;hall give the particulars in their pro|per place: This implacable animo&s;ity is the vice generally reigning among them; and it exerci&s;es the &s;ame Tyranny, without any exception, over all the Savages of <HI>America:</HI> The revenge of the Inhabitants of <HI>Canada</HI> is &s;ometimes very plea|&s;ant; for they eat their own lice, becau&s;e they have bitten them: If the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> hurt them&s;elves again&s;t a &s;tone, to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery c. 11. &amp; 14.</NOTE> revenged they bite it as hard as they can; It is ob&s;erved al&s;o that they bite the Arrows which light upon them in fight|ing.</P>

the Savage women of the &s;ame I&s;land: And though &s;he liv'd there a good while after among them, neither Captain <HI>Baron</HI> nor any other ever touched her; a great example of re&s;erved|ne&s;s in &s;uch people.</P>
<P>Yet mu&s;t it be acknowledged, that &s;ome of them have &s;ince degenerated from that cha&s;tity, and many other vertues of their Ance&s;tors: But we mu&s;t withall make this acknowledg|ment, that the <HI>Europaeans</HI> by their pernicious examples, and the unchri&s;tian-like treatment they have us'd towards them, ba&s;e|ly deceiving them, perfidiou&s;ly upon all occa&s;ions breaking their promi&s;es with them, unmercifully rifling and burning their hou&s;es and villages, and ravi&s;hing and debauching their Wives and Daughters, have taught them (to the perpetual in|famy of the Chri&s;tian name) di&s;&s;imulation, lying, treachery, perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, luxury, and &s;everal other vices, which were un|known in tho&s;e parts, before they had any Commerce with them.</P>
<P>But as to other concerns, the&s;e Savages are remarkable for their civility and courte&s;ie, beyond what can be imagined in Savages: Not but that there are &s;ome <HI>Caribbians</HI> very bruti&s;h and unrea&s;onable; but for the greater part of them their judgment and docility is ob&s;ervable upon many occa&s;ions, and tho&s;e who have conver&s;ed long with them, have found &s;everal experiences of their fair dealing, gratitude, friend&s;hip and ge|nero&s;ity: But of this we &s;hall &s;peak more particularly in the Chapter where we &s;hall treat of their <HI>Reception of &s;uch Stran|gers as come to vi&s;it them.</HI></P>
<P>They are al&s;o great lovers of cleanline&s;s (a thing extraordi|nary among Savages) and have &s;uch an aver&s;ion for all na&s;ti|ne&s;s, that if one &s;hould ea&s;e him&s;elf in their Gardens where their <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> and <HI>Potatoes</HI> are planted, they will pre|&s;ently for&s;ake them, and not make u&s;e of any thing growing therein: Of this their neatne&s;s in this and other things, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay more in the Chapter <HI>Of their Habitations, and their Repa&s;ts.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the natural &s;implicity of the <HI>Caribbians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ADmiration being the Daughter of Ignorance, we are not to think it &s;trange that the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who have &s;o little knowledge of tho&s;e excellent things which &s;tudy and experi|ence have made familiar among&s;t civiliz'd Nations, &s;hould be
<PB N="272" REF="150" MS="y">
&s;o much a&s;toni&s;h'd when they meet with any thing whereof the cau&s;e is unknown to them, and that they &s;hould be brought up in &s;o great &s;implicity, that it might be taken in mo&s;t of the&s;e poor people for a bruti&s;h &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>This &s;implicity is remarkable, among other things, in the extraordinary fear they conceive at the &s;ight of Firearms, which they look on with a &s;trange admiration; but their a&s;toni&s;h|ment is greate&s;t at Fire-locks, much beyond what they have for great Guns and Muskets, becau&s;e they &s;ee Fire put to them; but for Fire-locks, they are not able to conceive how it is po&s;|&s;ible they &s;hould take Fire; and &s;o they believe it is the evil Spirit <HI>Maboya</HI> who does that Office: But this fear and a&s;toni&s;h|ment is common to them with divers other Savages, who have not found any thing &s;o &s;trange in their encounters with the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> as tho&s;e Arms which &s;pit Fire, and at &s;o great a di|&s;tance wound and kill tho&s;e whom they meet with: This was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garcila&s;&s;o's Commentary Royal, l. 3. c. 8 Des Hayes Travels into the Levant.</NOTE> it, together with the Prodigy of &s;eeing Men fighting on Hor&s;e|back, which principally made the <HI>Peruvians</HI> think the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be Gods, and occa&s;ioned their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them with le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance. It is reported al&s;o that the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who make Incur&s;ions along the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> and &s;hould be more accu|&s;tomed to War, are not free from this fear and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Among the &s;everal di&s;coveries of the &s;implicity of our <HI>Ca|ribbians,</HI> we &s;hall here &s;et down two very con&s;iderable ones. When there happens an Eclip&s;e of the Moon, they believe that <HI>Maboya</HI> eats her, and they dance all night, making a noi&s;e with Gourds, wherein there are many &s;mall Pebbles: And when they &s;mell any thing of ill &s;cent, they are wont to &s;ay, <HI>Maboya cayeu eu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Devil is here; Caima Loary, Let us be gone becau&s;e of him,</HI> or <HI>for fear of him:</HI> Nay they attribute the name of <HI>Maboya,</HI> or Devil, to certain Plants of ill &s;cent, &s;uch as may be Mu&s;hrooms, and to whatever is apt to put them into any fright.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> were per&s;waded that Gun-powder was the Seed of &s;ome Herb; nay, there were tho&s;e who de&s;ir'd &s;ome of it to &s;ow in their Gar|dens; nay, &s;ome were &s;o ob&s;tinate, that, though di&s;&s;waded from it, they put it into the ground, out of a per&s;wa&s;ion that it would bring forth &s;omwhat, as well as other Seeds: Yet was not this Imagination &s;o gro&s;s as tho&s;e of certain Brutes of <HI>Guinny,</HI> who, the fir&s;t time they &s;aw <HI>Europaeans,</HI> thought the Commodities they brought them, &s;uch as Linnen, Cloathes, Knives, and Fire-arms, grew on the Earth &s;o prepar'd, as the Fruits did on Trees, and that there was no more to be done than to gather them: That certainly is not &s;o pardonable a piece of &s;implicity as that of the <HI>Caribbians:</HI> And we may fur|ther alledg, to excu&s;e that &s;implicity, or at lea&s;t to render it the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garcila&s;&s;o, l. 9. c. 16.</NOTE> more &s;upportable, the &s;tupidity of tho&s;e Inhabitants of <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="150" MS="y">
who, upon the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the <HI>New-World,</HI> imagin'd that the Hor&s;e and the Rider made up one Creature, like the imaginary Centaurs of the Poets: And that of tho&s;e others, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montagne's E&s;&s;ays, l. 1. c. 8.</NOTE> after they were &s;ubdu'd, coming to de&s;ire peace and pardon of the Men, and to bring them Gold and Provi&s;ions, went and made the &s;ame Pre&s;ents to the Hor&s;es, with a Speech much like that which they had made to the Men, interpreting the neighing of tho&s;e Creatures for a Language of compo&s;ition and truce: And to conclude the&s;e in&s;tances, we &s;hall add only the childi&s;h &s;ot|ti&s;hne&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Lery, c.</HI> 16 <HI>Garcila&s;&s;o, l.</HI> 9. <HI>c.</HI> 29.</NOTE> of tho&s;e &s;ame <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> who roundly be|liev'd, that the Letters which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent one to another were certain Me&s;&s;engers and Spies, &s;peaking, and &s;eeing, and di&s;covering the mo&s;t &s;ecret actions; and upon this per&s;wa&s;ion, fearing one day the eye and tongue of one of the&s;e Letters, they hid it under a &s;tone, that they might freely eat &s;ome Me|lons of their Ma&s;ters. In fine, there will be no cau&s;e to think it &s;o &s;trange that the <HI>Caribbians</HI> &s;hould take Gun-powder, a thing ab&s;olutely unknown to them, for &s;ome &s;eed that might be &s;own, when there were &s;ome people living in <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e habitations being at a great di&s;tance from the places where Salt was made, thought out of a like imagination that it was ga|ther'd in Gardens. It hapned al&s;o, not many years &s;ince, that a Woman, an Inhabitant of <HI>Martinico,</HI> having &s;ent &s;everal pounds of <HI>Caret</HI>-&s;hells and Tobacco to a She-Merchant of S. <HI>Ma|lo's,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caret is a kind of Tor|toi&s;e-&s;hell.</NOTE> when this latter had put off the Commodity, &s;he gave an account thereof to her Corre&s;pondent at <HI>Martinico,</HI> and ad|vis'd to plant <HI>Carets</HI> in her Garden rather then Tobacco, for that the former was much dearer in <HI>France,</HI> and that there was no danger of its rotting in the Ship, as there was of Tobacco. But let us con&s;ider what there is yet to be &s;aid concerning the natural &s;implicity of our Savages of the <HI>Caribbies.</HI></P>
<P>It is a plea&s;ant thing to con&s;ider that the&s;e poor people &s;hould be &s;o &s;imple, as that though they have many places fit for the making of Salt, yet dare they not make u&s;e of it, as accounting Salt extreamly prejudicial to health, and the pre&s;ervation of life; thence it proceeds that they never either eat of it, or &s;ea|&s;on their meat therewith; and when at any time they &s;ee our people make u&s;e of it, they &s;ay to them, out of a compa&s;&s;ion worthy compa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Compere, thou ha&s;tene&s;t thy own death:</HI> But in&s;tead of Salt, they &s;ea&s;on all their me&s;&s;es with <HI>Pyman,</HI> or Ame|rican Pepper.</P>
<P>Nor is there any Swines-fle&s;h eaten among them, which they call <HI>Coincoin,</HI> and <HI>Bou&iuml;rokou;</HI> nor yet Tortoi&s;e, (or as &s;ome call them Turtles) which they call <HI>Catallou,</HI> though there be abun|dance of tho&s;e Creatures in their Country: Of this their ab&s;ti|nence they give the &s;imple&s;t rea&s;ons imaginable: For as to the Swine, they are afraid to ta&s;te of it, le&s;t they &s;hould have &s;mall eyes like tho&s;e of that Bea&s;t; now in their judgment it is the
<PB N="274" REF="151" MS="y">
greate&s;t of all deformities to have &s;mall eyes, and yet there are few among them but have them &s;uch. As for the Tortoi&s;e, the rea&s;on of their ab&s;tinence from that is no le&s;s ridiculous; they will not feed on that, &s;ay they, out of a fear le&s;t if they did, they &s;hould participate of the lazine&s;s and &s;tupidity of that Creature.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e people who are known by the name of Savages are al&s;o full of &s;trange and fanta&s;tical imaginations concerning the matter and manner of eating: For example, the <HI>Canadi|ans</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. Junius in his Relations of New-Fra.</NOTE> ab&s;tain from Mu&s;cles, only out of a pure fancy; but they are &s;uch Bea&s;ts that they cannot give any rea&s;on for that ab&s;tinence: They will not ca&s;t the Beavers bones to the Dogs, le&s;t the &s;oul of that Bea&s;t &s;hould go and tell the other Beavers, and &s;o oblige them to leave the Country: It is reported al&s;o, That they do not eat the marrow of the back-bone of any Creature, for fear of having any pain in the back. The <HI>Bra&s;i|lians</HI> eat no hens egges, out of an opinion they are poi&s;on: They<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, c. 11</NOTE> ab&s;tain al&s;o from the fle&s;h of Ducks, and that of every Crea|ture that goes &s;lowly, as al&s;o from Fi&s;hes that do not &s;wim &s;wiftly, for fear of participating of the &s;lowne&s;s of tho&s;e Crea|tures. The <HI>Maldive&s;es</HI> forbear the meat of Tortoi&s;es, as the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pirard of the Animals of the Ea&s;t-In|dies, c.</HI> 2. <HI>Vin. le Blanc. Garcila&s;&s;o, l.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 7.</NOTE> <HI>Caribbians</HI> do; but it is becau&s;e of the conformity there is, in their judgment, between them and Man. The <HI>Calecutians,</HI> and &s;ome others who live more towards the Ea&s;t, never ta&s;te of the fle&s;h of wild Oxen, Cows, and Bulls, out of a per&s;wa|&s;ion that mens Souls, when they depart out of their Bodies, go and animate tho&s;e of the &s;aid Bea&s;ts. In fine, certain <HI>Pe|ruvians</HI> of the Province of <HI>Pastu</HI> ab&s;tain from all kinds of fle&s;h what&s;oever; and if they are intreated to ta&s;te thereof, their an&s;wer is, <HI>That they are not Dogs.</HI> All the&s;e In&s;tances are brought upon the Stage, to &s;hew that the aver&s;ion of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> to eat Salt, Swines-fle&s;h, and Tortoi&s;es, &s;hould not cau&s;e them to be accounted the mo&s;t &s;elf-will'd and mo&s;t extravagant of all the Savages.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the di&s;coveries we have already made of their &s;ot|ti&s;hne&s;s and &s;implicity, there is this yet to be added, That they are &s;o &s;tupid, that they cannot count a number exceeding that of the Fingers of their Hands and the Toes of their Feet, which they &s;hew to expre&s;s the &s;aid number, what exceeds it &s;urpa&s;|&s;ing with them all Arithmetick; &s;o that they would be very unfit for Bankiers; an humour contrary to that of the <HI>Chine|&s;es,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyage to the Ea&s;t Indies, 1630.</NOTE> who are &s;uch excellent Accomptants, that in a moment they ca&s;t up &s;uch Sums as it would trouble us much to do, and that with greater certainty.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have the priviledge not to be the only Nation in the World which may be reproach'd with this igno|rance; for it is as great among the people of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> and <HI>Guinny,</HI> to cite no more; nay, &s;ome ancient Hi&s;torians affirm,
<PB N="275" REF="151" MS="y">
That there were &s;ome people who could not count above five, and others who could not exceed four.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Guinny</HI> having counted to Ten, were wont to &s;et a mark, and then begin again. Certain Savages of the Septentrional part of <HI>America,</HI> to expre&s;s a great number, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to name, make u&s;e of an ea&s;ie kind of demon&s;tration, taking their hair or &s;ome &s;and in their hands; a &s;ort of compari&s;ons which are frequent in holy Scri|pture. The Inhabitants of the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands have al&s;o their invention to &s;upply the defect of Arithmetick; for when they are to go to the Wars, and are to be ready at their general Rendezvouz on a certain day, they take each of them one af|ter another an equal number of Pea&s;e, in their &s;olemn A&s;&s;em|bly; as for in&s;tance, thrice or four times Ten, and &s;ome certain number under Ten, if need be, according as they are re&s;olv'd to advance their Enterpri&s;e; they put up the&s;e Pea&s;e in a little Gourd, and every morning they take out one, and ca&s;t it away, till there are none left, and then the appointed time for their departure is come, and the next day they are to be upon their march: Another way they have is this, every one of them makes &s;o many knots on a little Cord, and every day they unty one, and when they are come to the la&s;t they make ready for the Rendezvouz: Somtimes al&s;o they take little pieces of Wood, upon which they make &s;o many notches as they intend to &s;pend days in their preparation; every day they cut off one of the notches, and when they come to the la&s;t, they take their march towards the place appointed.</P>
<P>The Captains, the <HI>Boyez,</HI> and the mo&s;t ancient among them, have more under&s;tanding than the common &s;ort, and by long experience, join'd to what they had receiv'd by tradition from their Ance&s;tors, they have acquir'd a gro&s;s knowledge of divers Stars; whence it comes that they count the Months by Moons, and the Years by the Seven Stars, taking particular notice of that Con&s;tellation: Thus &s;ome <HI>Peruvians</HI> regulated their Years by their Harve&s;ts: Tho&s;e Inhabitants of <HI>Canada</HI> who live in the Mountains ob&s;erve the number of the Nights and Winters; and the <HI>Sorique&s;es</HI> count by Suns. But though the more judicions among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> di&s;cern the Months, and the Years, and ob&s;erve the different Sea&s;ons, yet have they not any Monu|ments of Antiquity, and cannot tell how long it is &s;ince the fir&s;t of their Nation left the Continent, and &s;etled them&s;elves in the I&s;lands; but all the account they are able to give of it is, That neither them&s;elves, nor their Fathers, nor their Grandfa|thers could remember any thing of it; nor can they tell what age they are of, nor give any preci&s;e account of the time when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came into their Country, nor of &s;everal other things of that nature; for they take no notice of ought of this kind, and make no account of knowing what is done in the World.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e al&s;o who have convers'd among the Originary Inha|bitants of the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands, are forc'd to acknowledge, That they have, by the violence of their bruti&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, &s;mother'd all the apprehen&s;ions Nature had be&s;tow'd on them of a Divi|nity; that they have rejected all the Directions and In&s;tructi|ons which might guide them to the knowledge thereof; and con&s;equently, that by the ju&s;t judgment of God they are &s;ur|rounded by &s;o dreadful a night, that there is not to be &s;een among them either Invocation, or Ceremonies, or Sacrifices, or, in fine, any Exerci&s;e or A&s;&s;embly what&s;oever in order to Devotion: nay, they are &s;o far from having any of the&s;e things, that they have not &s;o much as a name to expre&s;s the Divinity, &s;o far are they from &s;erving it; &s;o that when any one would &s;peak to them concerning God, he mu&s;t u&s;e the&s;e circumlocutions; <HI>He who hath created the World, who hath made all things, who gives life and &s;u&s;tenance to all living Creatures,</HI> or &s;omthing of that kind: They are accordingly &s;o blinded and bruti&s;h, that they do not make any acknowledgment of the Lord of Nature, in that admirable work of the Univer&s;e; wherein he hath been pleas'd to repre&s;ent him&s;elf in a thou&s;and immortal colours, and make his adorable Omnipotency as it were vi&s;ible to the

<P>A certain <HI>Caribbian</HI> being at work on a Sunday, Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Montel</HI> relates how that he &s;aid to him, <Q>Friend, he who hath made Heaven and Earth will be angry with thee for working on this day; for he hath appointed this day for his &s;ervice: And I, <HI>reply'd very bluntly the Savage,</HI> am already very angry with him; for thou &s;aye&s;t he is the Ma&s;ter of the world and of the &s;ea&s;ons: He it is therefore who hath forborn to &s;end rain in due time, and by rea&s;on of the great drought hath cau&s;ed my <HI>Manioc</HI> and my <HI>Potatoes</HI> to rot in the ground: &s;ince he hath treated me &s;o ill, I will work on every Sunday, though 'twere purpo&s;ely to vex him.</Q> See here a pregnant example of the brutality of this wretched people.

<P>It is al&s;o conceiv'd, That it is out of the &s;ame de&s;ign of in&s;i|nuating them&s;elves into the favour of tho&s;e Mon&s;ters, that many times they macerate their Bodies by many bloody inci&s;ions and &s;uper&s;titious ab&s;tinences, and that they have &s;o great a venera|tion for the Magicians, who are the infamous Mini&s;ters of the&s;e infernal Furies, and the Executioners of their enraged Pa&s;&s;i|ons: Yet have not the&s;e abus'd wretches any Laws determining the preci&s;e time of all the&s;e damnable Ceremonies; but the &s;ame wicked Spirit which inclines them thereto, finds them occa&s;ions enough to exerci&s;e them, either by the ill treatment they re|ceive from him, or their own curio&s;ity to know the event of &s;ome military Enterpri&s;e, or the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e, or la&s;tly to find out the means of revenging them&s;elves of their Enemies.</P>
<P>But &s;ince tho&s;e who have liv'd many years in the mid&s;t of that Nation unanimou&s;ly affirm, That in their greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;|&s;es they never &s;aw them invocate any of tho&s;e Spirits, we are per&s;waded, that all tho&s;e little Services, which fear forces from them rather then reverence or love, ought not to be account|ed a true Wor&s;hip, or acts of Religion; and that we &s;hall give tho&s;e fooleries their right denomination, if we call them Super|&s;titions, Enchantments, Sorceries, and &s;hameful productions of that Art which is as black as are tho&s;e Spirits of darkne&s;s whom their <HI>Boyez</HI> con&s;ult: And we may conclude al&s;o, that the meat and drink which they pre&s;ent to tho&s;e counterfeit Di|vinities, cannot be properly called Sacrifices, but expre&s;s Com|pacts between the Divels and the Magicians, obliging them to appear when they call for them.</P>
<P>So that it is not to be thought &s;trange, that in all the&s;e weak &s;entiments which mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have of whatever hath any appearance of Religion, they &s;hould among them&s;elves laugh at the Ceremonies of the Chri&s;tians, and think the wor&s;e of tho&s;e of their Nation who expre&s;s any inclination to be Ba|pti&s;ed: The &s;ure&s;t way therefore for tho&s;e who&s;e hearts God &s;hould open to believe the holy Go&s;pel, would be to leave their Country and Friends, and to go into &s;ome of tho&s;e I&s;lands which are inhabited only by Chri&s;tians: For though they are not &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as the people of the Kingdom of <HI>Calecut,</HI> who think it a horror only to touch a per&s;on of a contrary per&s;wa&s;ion to theirs, as if they were thereby defil'd; nor yet &s;o rigorous as they are in the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu,</HI> where when a man embra|ces the Chri&s;tian Religion, the wife celebrates his Funeral as if he were dead, and erects a Tomb, at which having made her Lamentations, &s;he is at liberty to marry again, as if &s;he were effectually a Widow; yet he among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> who &s;hould
<PB N="286" REF="157" MS="y">
embrace Chri&s;tianity, would expo&s;e him&s;elf to thou&s;ands of reproaches and affronts, if he continu'd his aboad among them.</P>
<P>When they &s;ee the A&s;&s;emblies and Service of the Chri&s;tians, they are wont to &s;ay, is is pretty and divertive, but it is not the fa&s;hion of their Country; not expre&s;&s;ing in their pre&s;ence either hatred or aver&s;ion to the Ceremonies, as did the poor Savages who liv'd in the I&s;land of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and the neighbouring I&s;lands, who would not be pre&s;ent at the Service of the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> much le&s;s embrace their Religion, becau&s;e, as they &s;aid, they could not be per&s;waded that per&s;ons &s;o wicked and &s;o cru|el, who&s;e unmerciful barbari&s;m they had &s;o much experienc'd, could have any good belief.</P>
<P>Some Prie&s;ts and Religious men, who had been heretofore in that Country, having been over-forward in the baptizing of &s;ome before they had in&s;tructed them in that My&s;tery, have been the cau&s;e that that Sacrament is not in &s;uch reputation among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> as otherwi&s;e it might have been: And whereas their Godfathers and Godmothers gave them new Cloathes, and made them &s;ome other little Pre&s;ents on the day of their Bapti&s;m, and treated them very &s;umptuou&s;ly, within eight days after they had received that Sacrament they de&s;ired to receive it again, that they might have other Pre&s;ents and good cheer.</P>
<P>Not many years &s;ince, &s;ome of tho&s;e Gentlemen took into their charge a young <HI>Caribbian,</HI> their <HI>Catechumen,</HI> born in <HI>Dominico,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Ya Marabouy,</HI> a Son of that Cap|tain whom the <HI>French</HI> call the <HI>Baron,</HI> and the Indians <HI>Orachora Caramiana,</HI> out of a de&s;ign to &s;hew him one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent Cities in the World, which was <HI>Paris;</HI> they brought him over-Sea, and after they had &s;hewn him all the Ra|rities of that great City, he was baptiz'd there with great &s;o|lemnity, in the pre&s;ence of many Per&s;ons of Honour, and na|med <HI>Lewis:</HI> Having &s;ojourn'd a while in tho&s;e Parts, he was &s;ent back into his own Country, loaden indeed with Pre&s;ents, but as much a Chri&s;tian as when he came out of it, becau&s;e he had not been fully in&s;tructed in the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tian Re|ligion: As &s;oon as he had &s;et foot in his own I&s;land he laugh'd at all he had &s;een, as if it had been but a May-game, and &s;aying the Chri&s;tians were an extravagant &s;ort of people, he return'd into the Company of the other Savages, put off his Cloathes, and painted his Body over with <HI>Roucou,</HI> as he had done before.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the incon&s;tancy and lightne&s;s of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> in the Chri&s;tian Religion, when they have once embrac'd it, there is a Story, how that while M. <HI>Auber</HI> was Governour of <HI>Garde|loupe</HI> he was often vi&s;ited by a Savage of <HI>Dominico,</HI> who had liv'd a long time at <HI>Sevil</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> where he had been baptiz'd; but being return'd into his I&s;land, though he made as many Signs of the Cro&s;s as one would de&s;ire, and wore a great pair
<PB N="287" REF="157">
of Beads about his Neck, yet he liv'd like a Savage, went na|ked among his own people, and retain'd nothing of what he had &s;een and been taught at <HI>Sevil,</HI> &s;ave that he put on an old <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Habit, the more to ingratiate him&s;elf when he came to vi&s;it the Governour.</P>
<P>They have a very ancient Tradition among them, which &s;hews that their Ance&s;tors had &s;ome knowledg of a Superior Power which took a care of their Per&s;ons, and who&s;e favou|rable a&s;&s;i&s;tance they were &s;en&s;ible of; but this Light their bru|ti&s;h Children have &s;uffer'd to be extingui&s;h'd, and through their ignorance never reflected on it: They &s;ay then, That their Ance&s;tors were poor Savages, living like Bea&s;ts in the mid&s;t of the Woods, without Hou&s;es or places where they might re|treat, living on the Herbs and Fruits which the Earth produc'd of it &s;elf without manuring; whil&s;t they were in this mi&s;era|ble condition, an old man among them, extreamly weary of that bruti&s;h kind of life, wept mo&s;t bitterly, and, orewhelm'd with de&s;pair, deplor'd his wretched condition; whereupon a Man all in white appear'd to him de&s;cending from Heaven, and coming neer, he comforted the di&s;con&s;olate old man, telling him, That he was come to a&s;&s;i&s;t him and his Countrymen, and to &s;hew them the way to lead a more plea&s;ant life for the fu|ture; That if any one of them had &s;ooner made his complaints to Heaven, they had been &s;ooner relieved; That on the Sea|&s;hore there was abundance of &s;harp Stones, wherewith they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ll down Trees to make Hou&s;es for them&s;elves; And, That the Palm and Plantine Trees bore Leaves fit to cover the Roofs of them, and to &s;ecure them again&s;t the injuries of the Weather; That to a&s;&s;ure them of the particular care he had of them, and the great affection he bore their <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> beyond tho&s;e of other Creatures, he had brought them an excellent Root, wherewith they might make Bread, and that no Bea&s;t &s;hould dare to touch it when it was once planted; and that he would have them thence-forward make that their ordinary &s;u|&s;tenance: The <HI>Caribbians</HI> add further, That thereupon the charitable unknown per&s;on broke a &s;tick he had in his hand in|to three or four pieces, and that giving to the old man, he com|manded him to put them into the ground, a&s;&s;uring him that when he &s;hould come a while after to dig there, he &s;hould find a great Root; and that any part of what grew above-ground, &s;hould have the virtue of producing the &s;ame Plant: he after|wards taught him how it was to be u&s;ed, telling him the Root was to be &s;craped with a rough and &s;potted Stone, which was to be had at the Sea-&s;ide; that the juice i&s;&s;uing by means of that &s;craping, was to be laid a&s;ide as a mo&s;t dangerous poi&s;on; and then with the help of fire a kind of &s;avory Bread might be made of it, on which they might live plea&s;antly enough. The old man did what had been enjoin'd him, and at the end of nine
<PB N="288" REF="158" MS="y">
Moons (as they &s;ay) being extreamly de&s;irous to know the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the Revelation, he went to &s;ee the pieces he had plant|ed in the ground, and he found that each of them had produ|ced many fair and great roots, which he di&s;po&s;ed of as he had been commanded: Tho&s;e of <HI>Dominico</HI> who tell this &s;tory, &s;ay further, that if the old man had vi&s;ited the pieces at the end of three days, in&s;tead of nine months, he would have found the roots grown to the &s;ame bigne&s;s, and that they had been pro|duc'd in that time: But in regard he went not to look what became of them, till after the expiration of &s;o long a time, the <HI>Manioc</HI> continues to this pre&s;ent all that time in the ground, before it be fit to make <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> of.</P>
<P>This is all we could get from the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Tradition, and we conceiv'd it might well be &s;et here at length, &s;ince it is the only one that is related among this ignorant people, who trou|ble them&s;elves not to know the Name and Quality of that kind and heavenly Benefactor who hath obliged them &s;o much, nor to render him any acknowledgment or honour: The Pagans were much more grateful in honouring <HI>Ceres,</HI> from whom they &s;aid they received Corn, and the invention of making bread: And the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> though they knew not the great <HI>Pachaca|mac,</HI> that is, him whom they held to be the &s;oul of the Univer&s;e, and the Sovereign Author of their lives and all they had, yet did they adore him in their hearts with much re&s;pect and vene|ration, and rendring him externally by their ge&s;tures and words great expre&s;&s;ions of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and humility, as to the unknown God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> believe they have every one of them &s;o ma|ny &s;ouls as they feel beatings of Arteries in their bodies, be|&s;ides that of the heart: Now of all the&s;e &s;ouls the principal, as they &s;ay, is in the heart, and after death it goes to Heaven with its <HI>Icheiri,</HI> or its <HI>Chemiin,</HI> that is, with its God, who carries it thither to live there in the company of the other Gods: And they imagine that it lives the &s;ame kind of life as man lives here below: Thence it comes that to this day they kill &s;laves on the Tomb of the dead, if they can meet with any that had been in the &s;ervice of the decea&s;ed, to go and wait upon him in the other world: For it is to be ob&s;erved, that they do not think the Soul to be &s;o far immaterial as to be invi&s;ible; but they affirm it to be &s;ubtile, and of thin &s;ub&s;tance as a purified body; and they have but the &s;ame word to &s;ignifie heart and &s;oul.</P>
<P>As for the other &s;ouls, which are not in the heart, they believe &s;ome go after death and live on the Sea-&s;ide, and that they cau&s;e Ve&s;&s;els to turn: They call them <HI>Oumekou;</HI> the others, as they conceive, go and live in the Woods and Fore&s;ts, and they call them <HI>Maboyas.</HI></P>
<P>Though mo&s;t of this poor people believe the immortality

of the &s;oul, as we have repre&s;ented it, yet they &s;peak &s;o con|fu&s;edly, and with &s;o much uncertainty of the &s;tate of the &s;oul &s;eparated from the body, that we &s;hould &s;ooner have done to &s;ay they were ab&s;olutely ignorant thereof, than &s;et down their extravagant Relations. Some affirm, that the mo&s;t valiant of their Nation are carried after their death into certain <HI>Fortu|nate I&s;lands,</HI> where they have all things at their wi&s;h, and that the <HI>Arouagues</HI> are there their &s;laves; that they &s;wim unwearied in great Rivers; that they live deliciou&s;ly, and &s;pend the time in dancing, playing, and fea&s;ting, in a land which produces in abundance all &s;orts of excellent fruits without any cultiva|tion: On the contrary they hold, that tho&s;e who were cowardly &amp; afraid to go to the wars again&s;t their&punc; Enemies, do after death &s;erve the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> who inhabite barren and de&s;art Countries beyond the Mountains: But others who are more bruti&s;h ne|ver trouble them&s;elves about their condition after death, nor ever think or &s;peak of it: And if any que&s;tion be put to them concerning it, they know not what an&s;wer to make.</P>
<P>Yet they have all had heretofore a certain belief of the im|mortality of the Soul, but after a very gro&s;s manner, as may be deduc'd from the Ceremonies of their Interrments, and the prayers they make to the dead, that they would return to life, as we &s;hall repre&s;ent more at large in the la&s;t Chapter of this Hi&s;tory; as al&s;o from this, that the mo&s;t polite among them are at pre&s;ent of that per&s;wa&s;ion, that after death they &s;hall go to Heaven, to which place they &s;ay their Ance&s;tors are gone before them; but they never enquire after the way they are to take to attain that happy abode. Accordingly, when their <HI>Boyez,</HI> who al&s;o act the part of Phy&s;itians, de&s;pair of curing their di&s;ea&s;es, and that the Devils have foretold by their mouths that there is no further hopes of life, they give them this com|fort, that their Gods will conduct them to Heaven, where they &s;hall live at ea&s;e without any fear of &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>The belief of the <HI>Calecutians</HI> as to this Article is wor&s;e than<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirard'<HI>s Travels part</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 27.</NOTE> that of our <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and their tran&s;migration is an extrava|gant kind of immortality: For they believe that their &s;ouls at the departure out of their bodies are lodg'd in tho&s;e of wild Oxen, or &s;ome other bea&s;t. The <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are in this point more rational; for they conceive that the &s;ouls of the wicked go after death to the Devil, who beats and torments them, but that the &s;ouls of the ju&s;t are entertain'd with dancing and good cheer in delightful plains beyond the Mountains: And it is<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, c. 16</NOTE> plea&s;ant to think that mo&s;t of the Savages of <HI>America</HI> place the &s;overeign felicity of the other life in dancing.</P>
<P>The Re&s;urrection of the body is by the <HI>Caribbians</HI> account|ed a pure foolery; their Theology is too ob&s;cure to receive &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garcila&s;&s;o, <HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 7. De Laet, <HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 7.</NOTE> great an illumination: We may therefore well wonder at a &s;mall glimp&s;e of this &s;acred truth in the poor <HI>Virginians,</HI> &s;ince it is
<PB N="290" REF="159">
a point wherein the ancient Pagans &s;aw as little as our <HI>Caribbi|ans:</HI> There is al&s;o a &s;mall &s;park of it among the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Pe|ru,</HI> as mo&s;t Authors affirm.</P>
<P>But though the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have &s;o little knowledge and fear of God, as we have repre&s;ented, yet are they extreamly afraid of his voice, that is Thunder; that dreadful voice which makes &s;uch a &s;tir in the clouds, which is attended by &s;uch flames of fire, which &s;hakes the foundations of the Mountains, and makes the <HI>Neroes</HI> and <HI>Caligulaes</HI> of this world to tremble: Our Sava|ges therefore a&s;&s;oon as they perceive the approaches of the Tempe&s;t, which commonly comes along with that voice, make all the ha&s;te they can to their little hou&s;es, and &s;it down on low &s;tools about the fire, covering their faces and re&s;ting their heads on their hands and knees; and in that po&s;ture they fall a weeping, and &s;ay in their Gibberi&s;h, <HI>Maboya mouche fache contre Caraibe,</HI> that is, <HI>Maboya is very angry with them:</HI> and they &s;ay the &s;ame when there happens a Hurricane: They give not over that la|menting exerci&s;e, till the Hurricane is quite over; and they are extreamly a&s;toni&s;h'd, that the Chri&s;tians &s;hould expre&s;s &s;o &s;o little affliction and fear upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions. Thus the Grand <HI>Tartars</HI> are mightily afraid of Thunder, and when they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rubriques <HI>in his Tra|vels into</HI> Tartary.</NOTE> hear it, they drive all &s;trangers out of their hou&s;es, and wrap them&s;elves up in Garments of coar&s;e cloth, which they put not off till the noi&s;e be over: And divers other barbarous Na|tions are no le&s;s frighted than the <HI>Caribbians</HI> upon the like occa|&s;ions: Nay it is reported that the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> the <HI>Cumane&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Molucke&s;es</HI> imitate them in lamentations and frights, when there happens an Eclip&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet is it true, that &s;ince the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have conver&s;ed fami|liarly with the Chri&s;tians, &s;ome of them are grown &s;o re&s;olute as not to be afraid of the Thunder: for &s;ome have been &s;een to laugh when it thundred mo&s;t, and others counterfeited the noi&s;e, pronouncing a word which is not ea&s;ily written, and whereof the &s;ound comes &s;omewhat neer the&s;e letters, <HI>Trtrque|tenni:</HI> But it is very certain withall, that they do their natu|ral inclination a great violence when they pretend that they are not afraid of the Thunder, and it is pure vanity which eggs them on to per&s;onate that confidence, to per&s;wade tho&s;e who &s;ee them, that upon tho&s;e emergencies their genero&s;ity is as great as that of the Chri&s;tians: For &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> In|habitants of <HI>Martinico</HI> who have &s;urpriz'd them in their Quar|ters when it thundred and lightned, affirm that they found the mo&s;t re&s;olute among them &s;hivering with fear in their poor Huts.</P>
<P>Now this trouble and the&s;e di&s;turbances which they di&s;cover at the hearing of that coele&s;tial voice, are they not a vi&s;ible effect of the &s;entiment they have of an infinite and &s;overeign Power, imprinted by Nature on the minds of all men, and a pregnant

proof, that though the&s;e wretches endeavour all they can to &s;mother the &s;tings of their Con&s;ciences, yet can they not do it &s;o fully but that they prick and torment them, though again&s;t their wills? And is not this enough to make good the &s;aying of <HI>Cicero,</HI> at the begining of the precedent Chapter? For though all men do not in words acknowledge that Divinity, yet are they convinc'd in them&s;elves, by a &s;ecret but irre&s;i&s;ta|ble hand, which writes this fir&s;t of all Truths in their hearts with the point of a Diamond: So that to conclude, we &s;hall &s;ay with that great man, who&s;e words will put an excellent pe|riod to this di&s;cour&s;e, as they have begun it, That it is innate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Nat.

<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> have al&s;o, at a pretty di&s;tance from their hou&s;es, a place for the ea&s;ing of their natural nece&s;&s;ities, to which when they have need they re&s;ort, carrying along with them a &s;harp &s;tiok, wherewith they make a hole in the ground, into which having put their Ordure, they afterwards cover it with earth; &s;o that there is never any thing of that kind &s;een among them: We take the more particular notice of this Cu|&s;tom of theirs, becau&s;e it is con&s;onant to what was done by the Army of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> as long as they were in the Field: To the &s;ame<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut. c.</HI> 13.

<P><PB N="294" REF="161">But to return to our Savages: There are to be &s;een within the inclo&s;ures of their hou&s;es a great number of Poultry and Turkeys, which they breed not &s;o much for their own Tables, as to make Pre&s;ents to their Friends the Chri&s;tians who come to vi&s;it them, or to be exchang'd for Hedg-bills, Wedges, Hoes, and other In&s;truments of Iron which they &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o about their habitations good &s;tore of Orange-Trees, Citron-Trees, Guavas, Fig-Trees, Bananas, and other Fruit-Trees; many of tho&s;e little Trees which bear the <HI>Pyman,</HI> and the Shrubs and Simples whereof they have any acquain|tance, to be us'd when they have any need of them; and with the&s;e their little Gardens are bordered; but within they are full of Manioc, Potatoes, and &s;everal &s;orts of Pul&s;e, as Pea&s;e of di|vers kinds, Beans, Mais, &s;mall Millet, and &s;ome others: They have al&s;o Melons of all &s;orts, excellent Citruls, and a kind of Cabbage called the <HI>Caribbian</HI>-Cabbage, which are of a very delicious ta&s;te: But they be&s;tow their greate&s;t pains about the culture of the <HI>Ananas,</HI> which they prefer before all other Fruits.</P>
<P>But though they have no Villages, nor movable Hou&s;es, &s;uch as may be remov'd from one place to another, as is reported of the <HI>Bedovins</HI> a poor people of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> certain Moors inhabitants on the South-&s;ide of <HI>Tunis</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and certain Nations of Great-<HI>Tartary;</HI> yet do they often change their Habitations, as the humour takes them; for as &s;oon as they take the lea&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t to their Habitations, they immediately tran&s;plant them|&s;elves to &s;ome other place; and this is done of a &s;udden, and without de&s;iring any permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Cacick,</HI> as the ancient <HI>Peruvians</HI> were oblig'd to do of their King upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Among the occa&s;ions of this change of habitation among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the I&s;lands, one is a per&s;wa&s;ion that they &s;hall have their health better in &s;ome other place; the &s;ame cau&s;e occa&s;ions many times a removal of hou&s;e-keeping among the <HI>Bra&s;ilians:</HI> Sometimes it is caus'd by &s;ome na&s;tine&s;s done in their Habitations, for which they conceive a certain horrour; and &s;omtimes the death of one of the hou&s;e, which cau&s;ing in them an apprehen&s;ion of going the &s;ame way, obliges them to take up their Quarters in &s;ome other place, as if death could not as ea&s;ily meet with them there; but this fooli&s;h apprehen&s;ion is much more prevalent with the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Continent, who upon &s;uch occa&s;ions will be &s;ure to burn their habitations, and march to &s;ome other place: This plea&s;ant Super&s;tition is ob&s;ervable al&s;o among the <HI>Indians</HI> of the I&s;land of <HI>Cora&s;&s;ao,</HI> though tho&s;e poor people have receiv'd Bapti&s;m; for Mon&s;. <HI>du Montel</HI> relates, That being in the great Village of tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> named the <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> and having ob&s;erved in two or three pla|ces &s;ome hou&s;es without any Inhabitants, though they were not

The ancient <HI>Peruvians</HI> put them&s;elves to the trouble of &s;uch a removal, if their habitations receiv'd any prejudice by Thunder; for then they conceiv'd &s;uch an abomination there|at, that they made up the doors thereof with &s;tones and dirt, that no body might ever enter there any more.</P>
<P>It is reported, That heretofore the men of the Province of <HI>Quito</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI> thought it no &s;hame to employ them&s;elves in all things relating to hou&s;e-keeping, while their Wives went abroad walking at their plea&s;ures: And the ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> did the like, if we may credit <HI>Herodotus:</HI> And we are to acknowledg,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 2.</NOTE> that the employment of dre&s;&s;ing Meat in the Kitchen was ac|counted honourable in ancient <HI>Greece;</HI> for hone&s;t <HI>Homer</HI> in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 9.</NOTE> his Iliad repre&s;ents <HI>Achilles</HI> making a <HI>Ha&s;h,</HI> and &s;pitting the Meat, and all his Courtiers bu&s;ie in the Kitchen for the enter|tainment of the Emba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Agamemnon:</HI> And as to Fi&s;h, it hath always had this priviledge, that Per&s;ons of Quality have thought it no di&s;paragement to have a finger in the ordering of it.</P>
<P>But among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> the men think all the&s;e employ|ments below and unbefitting them; they for the mo&s;t part &s;pend the time abroad, but their Wives keep at home, and do all that is requi&s;ite about the hou&s;e: True it is, the men fell down Timber for the building of their Hou&s;es, and when they are built it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to keep them in repair; but the women take care for all things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Fami|ly: The men go a hunting and a fi&s;hing, as we &s;hall declare more at large el&s;where; but the women fetch home the Veni|&s;on from the place where it was kill'd, and the Fi&s;h from the Water-&s;ide: It is the womens work, in fine, to get in <HI>Manioc,</HI> to prepare the <HI>Ca&s;sava,</HI> and the <HI>Ou&iuml;cou,</HI> which is their ordinary Drink, to dre&s;s all the Meat, to &s;et the Gardens, and to keep the hou&s;e clean, and all the hou&s;hold-&s;tuff in good order; not not to mention the pains they take in painting their Husbands with <HI>Roucou,</HI> and &s;pinning Cotton for the u&s;e of the Family: &s;o that they are continually employ'd, and their work is never at an end, while their Husbands divert them&s;elves abroad; and &s;o they are rather to be accounted Slaves then Companions.</P>
<P>In the I&s;lands of S. <HI>Vincent</HI> and <HI>Dominico</HI> there are &s;ome <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> who have many <HI>Negroes</HI> to their Slaves, as the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> and &s;ome other Nations have; &s;ome of them they got from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, and &s;ome from <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships here|tofore ca&s;t away on their Coa&s;ts; and they call them <HI>Tamons,</HI> that is, <HI>Slaves:</HI> They are &s;o well ordered, that they &s;erve them in all things about which they are employ'd with as much obe|dience, readine&s;s, and re&s;pect, as if they were the mo&s;t civiliz'd people in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="162" MS="y">Now that we are treating of the Hou&s;es and Hou&s;ekeeping of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> &s;ome might take occa&s;ion to ask, Whether, as we have the u&s;e of Lamps, Candles, and Torches, they do not al&s;o make u&s;e of &s;ome light, and &s;ome artifice in the night-time, to &s;upply the want of the days light? True it is, they have learnt of the Chri&s;tians to make u&s;e of the Oil of Fi&s;hes, and to put Cotton into Lamps, to light them in the night-time; but mo&s;t of them have no other light in the night than a kind of wood very apt to take fire, which they have ready in the hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e, whence we call it <HI>Candle-wood;</HI> it is full of an unctuous Gum, which makes it burn like a Candle, and being once lighted, it gives a &s;weet &s;cent: In like manner the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> in&s;tead of Candles and Torches, in the night time make u&s;e of certain Gums which ea&s;ily take fire, and they put them into earthen Creu&s;ets, where they make a delightful and &s;weet &s;melling Fire: And if the Fire chance to go out among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> they have the &s;ecret of &s;upplying that want by rubbing two pieces of <HI>Mahot</HI> one again&s;t the other, and by that colli&s;ion they take fire, and in a &s;hort time burn into a clear flame: Thus the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> in&s;teed of a Steel and<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, <HI>c.</HI> 19.</NOTE> Stone, the u&s;e whereof they have not, make u&s;e of two &s;everal kinds of Wood, whereof one is almo&s;t as tender as if it were half rotten, and the other, on the contrary, very hard; and by that friction and agitation the fire takes in the former: The &s;ame thing is affirm'd of &s;ome &s;orts of Canes, which may be &s;een in the Cabinets of the Curious.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have &s;ail'd to the mouth of the River of the <HI>Amazones</HI> relate, that they there &s;aw &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> &s;trike fire with two &s;ticks, but after a manner different from that of our <HI>Caribbians;</HI> for in that part of the World they have al&s;o two pieces of Wood, one &s;oft, which they make flat and even like a Bu&s;k, and the other very hard, like a &s;tick &s;harpened at the end, which they thru&s;t into the &s;oft, which they keep clo&s;e to the ground under their feet; and they turn the other with both hands &s;o &s;wiftly, that at la&s;t the fire takes in that below, and &s;ets it of a flame: And whereas it many times happens one per&s;on may be weary of that exerci&s;e, another immediately takes the &s;tick in hand, and turns it with the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s, till they have got fire.

Gridiron, about two foot high, under which they kindle &s;o &s;mall a fire, that &s;ometimes it requires a whole day to make ready their fi&s;h as they would have it: Some of the <HI>French</HI> affirm, that have eaten &s;ome of their dre&s;&s;ing, they have lik'd it very well: It is ob&s;ervable generally in all their meat, that they dre&s;s all with a very gentle fire.</P>
<P>They commonly eat &s;itting on low &s;tools, and every one hath his little table by him&s;elf, which they call <HI>Matoutou,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> affirms, that it was practi&s;ed among the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> and as it is reported at this day to be done in <HI>Japan:</HI> Sometimes al&s;o they eat their meat on the ground, kneeling round one by another: For Table-cloths, they have no linnen, as we have, nor skins, as the <HI>Canadians;</HI> nor Mats as the <HI>Maldive&s;es,</HI> nor Carpets as the <HI>Turks</HI> and &s;ome other Nations, but fair and large <HI>Banana</HI>-leaves newly gathered, which are very fit for Table|cloths, being &s;o large as we have repre&s;ented el&s;ewhere: the &s;ame &s;erve al&s;o for Napkins, and they wipe their hands there with: They are alwaies very careful to wa&s;h their hands before meals: And when they are about the dre&s;&s;ing of any meat, they never touch any thing that is to be eaten, ere they make their hands clean: In fine, in all their ordinary Repa&s;ts, their &s;obriety and cleanline&s;s is &s;o ob&s;ervable as can hardly be imagined among Savages.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid el&s;ewhere that their ordinary bread is a thin Cake which they call <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> made of the <HI>Manioc</HI>-root: Other Writers have &s;et down the manner how it is made; yet that our Hi&s;tory may not be thought imperfect, we &s;hall here give a de|&s;cription of the compo&s;ition thereof: The root, though it be &s;ometimes about the bigne&s;s of a mans thigh, is ea&s;ily got out of the ground: A&s;&s;oon as it is taken out it is &s;craped with a knife to take off a little hard skin which covers it, and then it is &s;craped or filed with with a Ra&s;p or flat File of Iron or Cop|per, of a good bigne&s;s; and they pre&s;s the meal which comes from it in a linnen bag, or in a long kind of pokes, which they call in the I&s;lands, <HI>Snakes,</HI> neatly woven of Ru&s;hes or <HI>Latanier</HI> leaves by the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> that the juice may be &s;queezed out of it: The Savages before they knew the u&s;e of tho&s;e Ra&s;ps, made u&s;e in&s;tead thereof, of certain hard and &s;harp &s;tones which are to be found on the &s;ea-&s;hore: They are &s;omewhat like our Pumice-&s;tones: When the moi&s;ture of the <HI>Manioc</HI> is got out, the meal is &s;ifted through a coar&s;e cloth, and without mixing it with any liquor, it is put upon an Iron Plate, or Plank, and &s;ometimes on a broad &s;tone, under which there is fire; when it is baked on one &s;ide, they turn it on the other; and when it is fully baked, it is expo&s;ed to the Sun to make it har|der, that it may keep the better: It is commonly made no thicker than a mans little finger, and &s;ometimes thinner, ac|cording to the fancy of the Inhabitants: It will keep many
<PB N="299" REF="163">
months; but it eats be&s;t after a day or two making; there are &s;ome who would rather eat of it than of our ordinary bread: And the greate&s;t miracle is, that of a root &s;o dange|rous of it &s;elf people &s;hould by artifice get &s;o excellent nou|ri&s;hment: Thus the <HI>Moors</HI> drying a kind of poi&s;onous Apri|cocks which grow in their Country, in the Sun, and after|wards boiling them over a fire, make a certain drink thereof, which is plea&s;ant and may be drunk without any danger.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> make is very delicate; for they have &s;o much patience to go through with any thing they undertake, that they do better than the <HI>French,</HI> who are &s;o ha&s;ty, that they would make an end of any thing a&s;&s;oon as they have begun it: But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> go lea&s;urely to work, and never con&s;ider the time &s;pent, &s;o the bu&s;ine&s;s be done to their minds.</P>
<P>And whereas &s;ome <HI>Europaeans</HI> who have u&s;ed <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> com|plain that it is no good nouri&s;hment, that it injures the &s;to|mack, corrupts the blood, changes the colour, weakens the nerves, and dries the body; it is to be con&s;idered, that as cu|&s;tom is a &s;econd nature, &s;o that many things, though bad in them&s;elves, do not prejudice health when one is accu&s;tomed thereto; &s;o on the contrary, tho&s;e which are good and inno|cent, nay the be&s;t of their own nature, if a man be not accu|&s;tomed thereto, are many times prejudicial and hurtful: To confirm this truth, it is to be attributed to want of cu&s;tom, what is related by &s;ome Hi&s;torians of certain <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> who being &s;hut up with the <HI>Dutch</HI> in St. <HI>Margarets</HI> Fort, could not brook the bread and other provi&s;ions di&s;tributed to them as Soldiers, and on which it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and complained that they made them &s;ick, and were the occa&s;ions of their death: To this purpo&s;e there is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age in the Travels of Mon&s;ieur <HI>des Hayes</HI> into the <HI>Levant;</HI> to wit that the &s;aid per&s;on entertaining &s;ome <HI>Tartars</HI> at his Table, who knew not what bread was, cau&s;ed them to eat &s;ome; for within two hours after, they thought they &s;hould have dyed when the bread they had eaten began to &s;well, and to cau&s;e them great pains.</P>
<P>There is another kind of bread among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> made of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> wheat which they call <HI>Mais:</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inha|bitants of the <HI>Barmouthos</HI> u&s;e no other: There are &s;ome al&s;o who in&s;tead of bread eat the root called Potatoe, whereof we have given a de&s;cription el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>As concerning the other provi&s;ions u&s;ed by the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> their mo&s;t ordinary di&s;hes, and which are u&s;ed al&s;o by the <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> of the Continent, are Lizards, Fi&s;h of all &s;orts, Tortoi|&s;es only excepted; and Pul&s;e, as Pea&s;e, Beans, &amp;c. but their ordinary food (contrary to the Inhabitants of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> who have a horrour for that kind of &s;u&s;tenance) is Crabs, got very
<PB N="300" REF="164" MS="y">
clean out of their &s;hells, and fryed with their own fat, juice of Citron, and Pyman, which they are great lovers of, and which they put abundantly into all their &s;awces: And yet when they entertain the <HI>French,</HI> or other <HI>Europaeans,</HI> they are not &s;o pro|digal thereof, and then they accomodate them&s;elves to their palates, out of a compliance and di&s;cretion, which argues them to be &s;omewhat better than Savages. They call the in|ner part of the Crab <HI>Taumaly;</HI> and of that it is they make their ordinary Ragou&s;t with water, the fine flower of <HI>Manioc,</HI> and good &s;tore of <HI>Pyman.</HI> In the la&s;t cour&s;e they bring in fruits as we do; and ordinarily they content them&s;elves with Figs, Bananas, or Ananas: If they eat fle&s;h or any thing that is &s;alt|ed, it is only out of compliance with &s;trangers, to avoid being trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e who entertain them, and &s;o they accom|modate them&s;elves to their humours who come to vi&s;it them; for then they order mo&s;t of their meat to plea&s;e them: And to this mu&s;t be referred what we have &s;aid concerning their not eating of &s;alt, Swines-fle&s;h, Tortoi&s;es, and <HI>Lamantin.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, there are among this people certain men extreamly &s;lothful and melancholy, who lead a wretched kind of life: For they live only upon <HI>Burgaus, Shell-fi&s;h, Crabbes, Soldier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and &s;uch like In&s;ects: They never eat any Pottage, nor Fle&s;h, un|le&s;s it be that of certain birds which they broil on the coals with their Feathers about them, and their Guts within them; and all the Sawce they u&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of the water of <HI>Manioc</HI> (which be|ing boiled lo&s;es its venemous quality) fine flower of the &s;ame <HI>Manioc,</HI> and good &s;tore of <HI>Pyman.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes they have a dete&s;table kind of &s;ea&s;oning for their meats, and that is the fat of the <HI>Arouagues</HI> their irreconcileable Enemies: But this hath no place in their ordinary Repa&s;ts, as be|ing u&s;ed only on &s;olemn days of debauches and rejoicing.</P>
<P>As to their drink, as they do in &s;everal parts of <HI>America,</HI> the &s;ame grains of <HI>Mais</HI> which &s;erve to make bread, are u&s;ed for the compo&s;ition of a Drink which is accounted as good as Wine; and as among us the Wheat which makes Bread will al&s;o make Beer; &s;o in the&s;e I&s;lands, of the Roots of <HI>Potatoes</HI> and <HI>Manioc,</HI> which &s;erve to make Bread, there are made two &s;eve|ral &s;orts of Drinks, which are ordinary in the Country: The former and mo&s;t common, which is made of <HI>Potatoes</HI> boiled with water, is called <HI>Maby:</HI> It is excellent good to refre&s;h and quench thir&s;t, and it hath al&s;o an appetitive vertue, which cau|&s;es an evacuation of the &s;andine&s;s, and all the vi&s;co&s;ities of the lower parts: Whence it comes, that tho&s;e who make u&s;e of that Drink, never complain of the Stone or Gravel: The other Drink is called <HI>Ou&iuml;con</HI> (from a name coming neer the <HI>Caouin</HI> of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI>) and is made of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> it &s;elf, boiled in like manner with water: It is &s;trained through a coar&s;e cloth, which the Savages call <HI>Hibichet:</HI> This Drink is more ex|cellent

<P>The <HI>Ouicou</HI> is al&s;o made after another manner, without the Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Potatoes&punc; which is this; after the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> is taken off the Plank, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> laid &s;omewhere about the hou&s;e and cover|ed with the leaves of <HI>Manioc,</HI> and &s;ome heavy &s;tones laid thereon to &s;et it into a heat; and this is done for the &s;pace of three or four days: That done, it is broken into &s;everal pieces which are &s;pread on <HI>Banana</HI>-leaves, and then they are lightly &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inkled with water, and &s;o left: When the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> hath re|mained &s;o for the &s;pace of one night, it becomes all red: and then it is good to make <HI>Ouicou,</HI> and will make its water boil with out the Roots of <HI>Potatoes.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two &s;orts of Drinks which are the mo&s;t ordina|ry in the <HI>Caribbies,</HI> there are al&s;o made in divers places &s;eve|ral &s;orts of delicious&punc; Wines: The <HI>Negroes,</HI> who are &s;laves in the&s;e I&s;lands, make inci&s;ions in the prickly Palms, out of which there di&s;tils a certain liquor like White-wine, which they ga|ther in &s;everal little Gourds fa&s;ten'd to the overtures of tho&s;e trees, whereof each will yield two pints every day, and &s;ome|times more: The mo&s;t ancient Authors a&s;&s;ure us, that among the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indians,</HI> the Wine of Palms was very much in u&s;e, as indeed it is at this day: It is al&s;o u&s;ed in &s;ome parts of <HI>Africk,</HI> as at <HI>Mo|nomotapa.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover there is in the <HI>Caribbies</HI> another kind of Drink made of <HI>Bananas,</HI> which is al&s;o in other parts, and by &s;ome cal|led <HI>Cou&s;cou:</HI> But in regard this &s;ort of Wine, though very plea&s;ant and &s;trong, cau&s;es great vento&s;ities, it is not much u&s;ed.</P>
<P>To conclude, there is made in the&s;e I&s;lands an excellent kind of Wine of tho&s;e precious Reeds out of which the Sugar is gotten: And this is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed Drink of any made in the <HI>Caribbies:</HI> It is called by &s;ome <HI>Cane-wine,</HI> and there is a

particular &s;ecret in the making of it: There is more made at S. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> then any where el&s;e, by rea&s;on of the abundance of Canes planted there: The juice of the&s;e Canes is got out by a Mill made purpo&s;ely for that u&s;e; afterwards it is purified by fire in great Caldrons: It may be kept a long time in its perfe|ction, and it hath a &s;weetne&s;s, and withal a certain picquancy, which might make it pa&s;s for Sack. Of the &s;ame Canes there is al&s;o made a certain <HI>Aquavitae</HI> called <HI>Cane-Aquavitae,</HI> which keeps better then the Wine of tho&s;e &s;ame Reeds.</P>
<P>There is not any thing in the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e ordinary Re|pa&s;ts of our <HI>Caribbians,</HI> which &s;eem to &s;avour of the Savage, unle&s;s it be haply the Lizards; But why may not they be as good Meat as the Frogs and Snails eaten in &s;ome parts of <HI>France?</HI> And who knows not that in <HI>Spain</HI> they eat abundance of young A&s;&s;es? Nay, compare the &s;u&s;tenance of our <HI>Caribbi|ans</HI> with that of the <HI>Canadians,</HI> who, be&s;ides the skimmings of the Pot, which we &s;aid they eat, do commonly drink filthy and na&s;ty grea&s;e, and prefer the fle&s;h of Bears before any other; with that of the Inhabitants of the I&s;land of <HI>Good-fortune,</HI> one of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> who eat abundance of Suet; with that of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Huancas,</HI> a Nation of <HI>Peru,</HI> of the Negroes of <HI>Angola,</HI> who commonly live on the fle&s;h of Hor&s;es, Cammels, Mules, Wolves, Foxes, A&s;&s;es, Dogs, and drink the Blood of tho&s;e Creatures; with that of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indians,</HI> who think the Fle&s;h of Bats and Mice as de|licious as that of Partridges; with that of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> who feed on Toads, Rats, and Worms; or, la&s;tly, with that of the <HI>Tapuyes,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who eat hair minc'd very &s;mall, and mix'd with wild honey, and &s;ea&s;on all their Meat with the a&s;hes of the burnt Bodies of their deceas'd Relations, and mix them with the meal they bake, which cau&s;es horrour only to repre&s;ent, much more to do: Let there be, I &s;ay, a compari&s;on made between all the&s;e infamous Ragouts, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Nation, and it will be found, that in their or|dinary Commons there is nothing barbarous: Yet are we not to di&s;&s;emble what &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> relate, to wit, That they have &s;een the <HI>Caribbians</HI> eating the Lice and <HI>Chegoes</HI> they had taken; as it is reported of the <HI>Mexicans</HI> and <HI>Cumane&s;es:</HI> but they do not make their Ordinary out of them, and it is parti|cular only to &s;ome among them; be&s;ides that they do it not out of any delicacy they find in tho&s;e Vermine, but only to be revenged of them.</P>
<P>Moreover, the horrour which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> conceiv'd here|tofore at the eating of Swines-fle&s;h, Tortoi&s;es, and Lamantin, for the plea&s;ant rea&s;ons before alledged, was &s;o great, that if any of the <HI>Europaeans</HI> had got them to eat any of them by &s;ur|prize, and they came afterwards to know it, they would be reveng'd of them one time or other; witne&s;s what happened to

a per&s;on of &s;ome note among the <HI>French:</HI> This per&s;on receiving a Vi&s;it from the <HI>Cacick</HI> or Captain of the Savages of the I&s;land where he liv'd, entertain'd him in je&s;t with <HI>Lamantin,</HI> di&s;guis'd in the fa&s;hion of a Ha&s;h; the <HI>Cacick</HI> mi&s;tru&s;ting what indeed afterwards happened to him, intreated the Gentleman not to deceive him; and upon the a&s;&s;urance given him thereof, he made no difficulty to eat: after Dinner the Gentleman di&s;co|ver'd the abu&s;e to the <HI>Cacick</HI> and his Company, that he might have the plea&s;ure of their Di&s;cour&s;es thereupon, and &s;ee what faces they would make after &s;uch a Treatment; but they had at that time &s;o much power over them&s;elves as to &s;mother their indignation, and the <HI>Cacick</HI> only &s;aid to him &s;miling, <HI>Well Friend we &s;hall not dye of it:</HI> Some time after the Gentleman went to return him his Vi&s;it; he receiv'd him with great civility, and made him extraordinary cheer; but he had given his people order to put into all the Sauces &s;ome fat of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> whereof the principal <HI>Indians</HI> are always well provided: After this infamous Repa&s;te was ended, the <HI>Cacick,</HI> glad in his heart, ask'd the Gentleman and his Company how they lik'd his Treatment; whereupon they commending it very much, and giving him thanks for it, he acquainted them with the trick he had put upon them; mo&s;t of them were &s;o troubled at the thought of it, and had &s;uch an inclination to ca&s;t up all they had eaten, that they grew very &s;ick; but the <HI>Indian</HI> laughing at the &s;pectacle, told them that he was then reveng'd.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have lately been among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of <HI>Domi|nico</HI> and <HI>Martinico</HI> affirm, That now mo&s;t of them make no difficulty to eat <HI>Lamantin,</HI> Tortoi&s;es, and Swines-fle&s;h, nay, all other Meats in u&s;e among the <HI>Europaeans;</HI> and that they laugh at the &s;implicity which oblig'd them to ab&s;tain from them, for fear of participating of the nature and qualities of tho&s;e Ani|mals.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o remitted much of that &s;everity which they u&s;ed towards their Wives; for now they are &s;eldom &s;een to fetch home the Fi&s;h their Husbands had taken: And when they have been a fi&s;hing, the Husband and Wife eat together: The Women go al&s;o oftener to the <HI>Carbet,</HI> to participate of the Fea&s;t and the publick rejoycing there made, then they did be|fore their Husbands became &s;o familiarly acquainted with Strangers.</P>

<P>But our <HI>Caribbians</HI> are not like the&s;e la&s;t; for they are found taking pains and their plea&s;ure in &s;everal &s;orts of exerci&s;es: The chiefe&s;t, and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t ordinary among them are Hunting and Fi&s;hing, wherein they be&s;tow the greate&s;t part of their time, but e&s;pecially in Fi&s;hing: They are &s;eldom &s;een to go out of their Hou&s;es without their Bows and Arrows; and they are wonderfully expert in the u&s;e of them, being accu&s;to|med to that exerci&s;e from their Infancy, as the <HI>Turks</HI> al&s;o are; whence it comes, that in time they come to be &s;o excellent at the Bow, that within a hundred paces they will hardly ever fail &s;triking a half-Crown piece; nay, as they are making their Re|treat they can do execution on their Enemies, as the <HI>Parthians</HI> were &s;omtimes wont to do: How much therefore are we the more to wonder at tho&s;e <HI>left-handed</HI> Benjamites, <HI>who could</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 20. 16.</NOTE> <HI>&s;ling &s;tones at an hairs-breadth, and not mi&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Caribbians</HI> go abroad a hunting or a fi&s;hing, they do not take their Wives along with them, as &s;ome <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> do, who cau&s;e theirs to walk before them, &s;o great is their jealou&s;ie; but when they have taken any thing, they leave it upon the place, and the Women were heretofore oblig'd to go and bring it home, as we have already hinted: It is reported that the <HI>Ca|nadians</HI> do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the I&s;lands there is no di&s;tinction of
<PB N="305" REF="166" MS="y">
quality as to Hunting; but the exerci&s;e of it is as free to the meane&s;t as to the greate&s;t among them: The ca&s;e is the &s;ame among all the other <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>As in their private Repa&s;ts they never u&s;e no kind of Fle&s;h, if they have not Strangers to entertain, &s;o ordinarily their hunt|ing is only for Lizards; and if they engage them&s;elves in any other kind of hunting, it is upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions, when they would treat &s;ome of their Friends among the <HI>Euro|paeans,</HI> or when they intend to vi&s;it them, and would get &s;om|thing of them in exchange for what they had taken.</P>
<P>They are extreamly expert in fi&s;hing with the Hook, and in taking of Fi&s;h with the Dart; and a man cannot &s;ufficiently admire their patience in that Exerci&s;e; for they would be con|tent to continue half a day in the &s;ame place, without betray|ing any wearine&s;s: And when, after they have waited a long time for the Fi&s;h, they come at length to perceive &s;ome great one to their mind, and within their reach, they ca&s;t the Dart at it, as the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> do; which having fa&s;tned, they imme|diately leap into the water after the Dart, to &s;eize their prey: But be&s;ides the Hook and Dart wherewith they take Fi&s;h, they are al&s;o very excellent in diving neer the Rocks, and forcing them out of the holes where they &s;helter them&s;elves; as being in that particular equally expert with the <HI>Floridians,</HI> who, not<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, <HI>c.</HI> 12.

'Tis a common thing among the Savages to be excellent Swimmers and Divers; and it is particularly affirm'd of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> the <HI>Maldive&s;es,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Peruvians,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the I&s;lands of <HI>Robbers,</HI> that they may pa&s;s for a kind of amphibious Crea|tures.</P>
<P>But if the other inventions for fi&s;hing &s;hould fail our <HI>Carib|bians,</HI> they have their recour&s;e to a certain wood, which they brui&s;e after they have cut it into little pieces; which done, they ca&s;t it into Ponds, or tho&s;e places where the Sea is quiet and calm; and this is as it were a Sovereign Mummy, wherewith they take as much Fi&s;h as they plea&s;e; but they are &s;o prudent as not to make u&s;e of this la&s;t expedient but only in ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, for fear of making too great a wa&s;te among the Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>After Hunting and Fi&s;hing, they apply them&s;elves to &s;everal kinds of Works, as to make Beds of Cotton, very neatly wo|ven, which they call <HI>Amaes:</HI> The Women &s;pin the Cotton on the knee, and commonly they make u&s;e of neither Di&s;taff nor Spindle; but &s;ome of them in the I&s;land of <HI>Martinico</HI> have learn'd the u&s;e thereof of the <HI>French:</HI> They have al&s;o the per|fect Art of twi&s;ting it; but in &s;ome I&s;lands the Men weave the Beds: Be&s;ides this, they make Baskets of Bull-ru&s;hes, and Gra&s;s,

of divers colours; wooden chairs all of one piece; little Ta|bles, which they call <HI>Matoutou,</HI> weav'd of the leaves of the <HI>Latanier</HI>-tree; the &s;training-cloths called <HI>Hibichets;</HI> the <HI>Cato|lis,</HI> which are a kind of great ba&s;kets to carry things on the back; &s;everal &s;orts of Ve&s;&s;els fit for eating and drinking, which are poli&s;h'd, painted, and adorn'd with abundance of pretty figures delightful to the eye: They make al&s;o &s;ome other little ornaments, as Girdles, Hats, and Crowns of fea|thers, wherewith they &s;et out them&s;elves on &s;olemn days: And the women make for them&s;elves a kind of Bu&s;kins, or half-&s;tockings of Cotton. But above all they take abundance of pains in ordering and poli&s;hing their Arms, that is, their Bows, their Arrows, and their <HI>Boutous</HI> or Clubs, which are of a hard and &s;mooth wood, and neatly wrought about the han|dles with wood and bones of divers colours.</P>
<P>They take no le&s;s pains about their <HI>Piragas,</HI> or Ve&s;&s;els wherein they go to Sea, and whatever belongs to Peace or War. The&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are made of one great Tree, which they make hollow, &s;mooth, and poli&s;h with an unimaginable dexte|rity: The greater &s;ort of <HI>Piragas</HI> are many times rais'd higher all about, e&s;pecially towards the poop, with &s;ome planks: Sometimes they paint in them their <HI>Maboya;</HI> &s;ometimes they repre&s;ent Savages, or &s;ome other fanta&s;tick figures. The&s;e Shallops are &s;o large as many times to carry fifty men with all their Arms. Before they had any acquaintance with the <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> who furni&s;h'd them with all &s;orts of Wedges, and other Carpenters and Joyners tools, they were put to a great deal of trouble to make their Ve&s;&s;els; for they were oblig'd, as the <HI>Virginians,</HI> and &s;ome other Savages were, to &s;et fire at the foot<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, <HI>c.</HI> 13.</NOTE> of the Trees, and to compa&s;s them about a little above the foot with wet mo&s;s, to keep the fire from a&s;cending; and &s;o they undermin'd the Tree by little and little: Afterwards to pierce the wood they us'd certain hard &s;tones &s;harpened at one end, wherewith they cut and made their <HI>Piragas</HI> hollow, but with &s;o great trouble and expence of time, that they acknow|ledge how much they are oblig'd to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who have taught them ea&s;ier ways to do it, by the iron-in&s;truments wherewith they have &s;upply'd them. Thence it came that the <HI>Peruvians</HI> thought it &s;o great a happine&s;s to have the tools<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comment. Royal,</HI> l. 1. c. 11.</NOTE> which were brought them by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> that the u&s;e of Sci&s;&s;ers being introduc'd into <HI>Peru</HI> by the means of the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> of Quality admiring the invention, &s;aid to one of them, That though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not furni&s;h them with any thing but Ra&s;ors, Sci&s;&s;ers, Combs and Looking-gla&s;|&s;es, it &s;ufficiently oblig'd them liberally to be&s;tow on them all the gold and &s;ilver they had.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> employ them&s;elves al&s;o in making earthen Pots of all &s;orts, which they bake in furnaces, as our Potters
<PB N="307" REF="167">
do: And of the &s;ame material they al&s;o make tho&s;e Plates or Planks on which they bake the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava.</HI></P>
<P>The dexterity they expre&s;s in the&s;e little Exerci&s;es, is a &s;uf|ficient di&s;covery that they would ea&s;ily learn other Trades, if they were taught them. They delight very much in handling the tools of Carpenters and Joyners; and though they have not been taught how they are to be us'd, yet are they able to do many things &s;ince the <HI>Europeans</HI> have &s;upply'd them there|with: So that it is to be pre&s;um'd, that if they had good Ma|&s;ters, they would do well at tho&s;e Trades.</P>
<P>They are great Lovers of diverti&s;ements and recreation; and thence it comes they &s;eek after whatever may keep them in a good humour, and divert melancholy: To that purpo&s;e they take a plea&s;ure in keeping and teaching a great number of Parrots and Paraquitos.</P>
<P>To divert them&s;elves they al&s;o make &s;everal Mu&s;ical In&s;tru|ments, if they may be &s;o called, on which they make a kind of harmony: Among others they have certain Tabours or Drums made of hollow Trees, over which they put a &s;kin on|ly at one end: To this may be added a kind of Organ which they make of Gourds, upon which they place a cord made of the &s;tring of a reed which they call <HI>Pite;</HI> and this cord being touch'd makes a &s;ound which they think delightful. The con|certs of divers other Savages are no better then theirs, and no le&s;s immu&s;ical to their ears who under&s;tand Mu&s;ick. In the morning, as &s;oon as they are up, they commonly play on the Flute or Pipe; of which In&s;trument they have &s;everal &s;orts, as well poli&s;h'd and as hand&s;om as ours, and &s;ome of tho&s;e made of the bones of their Enemies: And many among them can play with as much grace as can well be imagin'd for Savages. While they are playing on the Flute, the Wives are bu&s;ie in making ready their breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o they pa&s;s away the time in &s;inging certain Airs, the burthens whereof are plea&s;ant enough; and in that Exerci&s;e they &s;ometimes &s;pend half a day together, &s;itting on their low &s;tools, and looking on their fi&s;h while it is broiling. They al&s;o put pea&s;e or &s;mall pebble-&s;tones, as the <HI>Virginians</HI> do, into gourds, through the mid&s;t whereof they put a &s;tick which &s;erves for a handle, and then &s;haking them they make a noi&s;e: This is the invention the women have to quiet their children. Mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribbian</HI> Songs con&s;i&s;t of bitter raille|ries again&s;t their Enemies; &s;ome they have al&s;o on Birds, and Fi&s;hes, and Women, commonly intermixt with &s;ome bawdery; and many of them have neither rhime nor rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Many times al&s;o the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the I&s;lands joyn Dancing to their Mu&s;ick, but that Dancing is regulated according to their Mu&s;ick. There are &s;ome Barbarians exce&s;&s;ively addicted to that Exerci&s;e, as for in&s;tance the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> who, as <HI>de Lery</HI>
<PB N="308" REF="168">
affirms, &s;pend day and night in dancing: And we have &s;aid el&s;e|where, that there are many Savages who make their imagina|ry felicity of the other life to con&s;i&s;t in dancing.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> u&s;e Dancing particularly at their &s;olemn Entertainments in their <HI>Carbet,</HI> or publick hou&s;e. The&s;e En|tertainments are ordered after this manner: Some days before the meeting the Captain gives notice to every hou&s;e, that all may appear at the <HI>Carbet</HI> at the day appointed: In the mean time the Women make a kind of &s;trong drink of bak'd <HI>Ca&s;&s;a|va,</HI> and better prepar'd then that which they ordinarily drink; and as they adde to the do&s;e of the Ingredients, &s;o is the drink the &s;tronger, and more apt to intoxicate: The men go a fi&s;hing, or catching of Lizards; for as to other meat they &s;eldom prepare any for their own Tables, unle&s;s they have Strangers to entertain: On the day appointed both men and women paint their bodies with divers colours and figures, and adorn them&s;elves with their Crowns of Feathers, their riche&s;t Chains, Pendants, Bracelets, and other Ornaments: Tho&s;e among them who would appear mo&s;t gallant rub their bodies with a certain Gum, and blow the Down of diver&s;e Birds upon it. In fine, they all put on their be&s;t faces, and endeavour to make the greate&s;t &s;hew they can at this &s;olemnity, priding it in their Plumes, and all their other gallantry: The women bring thither the Drink and Me&s;&s;es they have prepared, and are ex|treamly careful that nothing be wanting, which may contri|bute to the &s;olemn entertainment: Our <HI>Caribbians</HI> &s;pend all that day and the be&s;t part of the night in eating and drinking, dancing, di&s;cour&s;ing and laughing: And in this Debauch they drink much more than ordinary, that is, they make a &s;hift to get drunk; and the women will not be much behind them, e&s;pecially when they can get any Wine, or <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> to pro|mote the work: So that what we have &s;aid of their ordinary &s;obriety holds not at the&s;e Meetings; no more than it does at their going to their Wars, and at their return thence: and yet take them at the wor&s;t, their exce&s;&s;es come much &s;hort of tho&s;e of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> who in their Debauches drink three or four days without cea&s;ing, and in their drunkenne&s;s engage them|&s;elves in all kind of Vices.</P>
<P>Their drunkennne&s;s and their debauches are frequent, as hapning upon the&s;e &s;everal occa&s;ions: 1. When there is any Coun|cel held concerning their Wars: 2. When they return from their Expeditions, whether they have prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful or not: 3. Upon the birth of their fir&s;t Male Children: 4. When they cut their Childrens hair: 5. When they are at age to go to the Wars: 6. When they cut down trees, in order to the making of a Garden and building of a Hou&s;e: 7. When they launch a new Ve&s;&s;el: And la&s;tly when they are recovered of &s;ome di&s;|ea&s;e: They call the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies <HI>Ou&iuml;cou,</HI> and &s;ince they have conver&s;ed with the <HI>French, Vin,</HI> that is, <HI>Wine.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of the Entertainment which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> make tho&s;e who come to vi&s;it them.</HEAD>
<P>HEre it is that our <HI>Caribbians</HI> triumph over all other Sava|ges in point of civility: For they receive &s;trangers, who come to their I&s;lands to vi&s;it them, with all manner of kindne&s;s and te&s;timonies of affection.</P>
<P>They have &s;entinels all along the Sea-&s;ide in mo&s;t of tho&s;e I&s;lands whereof they are &s;olely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: The&s;e &s;entinels are placed on the Mountains, or &s;uch eminent places whence they may &s;ee a good way into the Sea; and they are &s;o di&s;pos'd, that they overlook tho&s;e places where there is good anchorage for Ships, and an ea&s;ie de&s;cent for men to land: A&s;&s;oon as ever the&s;e perceive a Ship or Shallop coming towards them, they give notice thereof to &s;uch of their people as are next to them: Whereupon of a &s;udden there come out together &s;everal Ca|nows or Ve&s;&s;els, in each whereof there are not above three men at mo&s;t, who are &s;ent out to di&s;cover what they are, and call to them at a di&s;tance to declare them&s;elves; for they tru&s;t not the Flagg, as having been often deceived thereby: and they know by their voices whether they be <HI>French, Spaniards, Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch.</HI> Some affirm, that the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> and the <HI>Pe|ruvians</HI> are &s;o exact in their &s;melling, that they will di&s;cern a <HI>French-man</HI> from a <HI>Spaniard</HI> by the &s;cent.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Caribbians</HI> are not well-a&s;&s;ured who they are who come towards them, and perceive that they intend them &s;ome mi&s;chief, they put them&s;elves into a po&s;ture of defence, po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the narrowe&s;t avenues of their Country, place ambu&s;hes in the Woods, and without being perceiv'd keep an eye on their Enemies, retreating through ob&s;cure waies till they have found their advantage, and joined all their For|ces together; and then they let flie a &s;hower of Arrows on their Enemies: That done, they &s;urround them, clo&s;e with them, and cut them all off with their Clubs: In &s;ome I&s;lands they make
<PB N="310" REF="169">
up a body of fifteen hundred men and more, as may be gue&s;s'd by their appearance; for their number cannot be certainly known, ina&s;much as they them&s;elves not knowing how to reck|on, cannot tell what numbers they are: But if they are pre&s;|&s;ed by their Enemies, they get into the Woods, or climb up Rocks that are inacce&s;&s;ible to all others; or if they are neer the Sea, they leap in and dive, and ri&s;e up again at a hundred, nay &s;ometimes two hundred paces from the place where they had been &s;een: And afterwards they rally together, at certain Rendezvou&s;es known to them&s;elves, and charge afre&s;h when it is lea&s;t expected, and when they were thought to be ab&s;olute|ly routed.</P>
<P>But when they find tho&s;e coming to them to be friends who come only to vi&s;it them, after they have cry'd to them that they are welcome, &s;ome ca&s;t them&s;elves into the water and &s;wim to them, enter into their Ve&s;&s;el, and when they come neer land proffer to carry them a&s;hore on their backs, as an a&s;&s;urance of their affection: In the mean time the Captain him&s;elf, or his Lieutenant, expects them on the &s;hore, and receives them in the name of the whole I&s;land: Thence they are conducted by a con&s;iderable number of them to the <HI>Carbet,</HI> which is as it were the Town-Hou&s;e, where the Inhabitants of the I&s;land, every one according to the age and &s;ex of the New-comers, bid them welcome: The old Man complements and makes much of the old Man; the young Man and Maid do the like towards tho&s;e of their age; and a man may read in their countenances how much they are &s;atisfied with the vi&s;it.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e they make to the Stranger is to ask him his name, and then to tell him theirs: And for an expre&s;|&s;ion of great affection and inviolable friendship, they call them|&s;elves by the names of tho&s;e whom they entertain: But to crown the Ceremony, they will have the per&s;on whom they re|ceive in like manner to a&s;&s;ume their name: Thus they make an exchange of names; and they have &s;uch excellent memo|ries, that ten years after &s;uch a meeting they will remember the names of their friends, and relate &s;ome circum&s;tance of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the former interview: And if they were pre&s;ented with any thing, they will be &s;ure to call it to mind; and if the thing be &s;till in being, they will &s;hew it to him who had be&s;towed it on them.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e complements which are pa&s;&s;ed at the fir&s;t meeting, the next is to pre&s;ent their Gue&s;ts with tho&s;e pen&s;ile Beds which they call <HI>Amais,</HI> very clean and white, whereof they have &s;tore again&s;t &s;uch occa&s;ions: They de&s;ire them to re&s;t them&s;elves thereon, and then they bring in Fruits; and while &s;ome are bu&s;ie preparing &s;ome treatment, others entertain them with di&s;cour&s;e, ob&s;erving &s;till the conformity of age and &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="169">This kind of entertainment may well be accounted more rational than that of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Southerly part of Continent, who receive their Gue&s;ts after a very odd fa&s;hion, not much unlike what is practi&s;ed by the <HI>Canadians:</HI> For the <HI>Ca|cick</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Caribbians</HI> conducts him who comes to &s;ee them to the Publick-hou&s;e, without &s;peaking at all to him: then he is pre&s;ented with a &s;tool and &s;ome Tobacco, and &s;o they leave him for a time, without &s;peaking a word to him, till he hath re&s;ted him&s;elf and taken his Tobacco: Then the <HI>Cacick</HI> comes and asks him, whether he be come? The other an&s;wering yes, he &s;its down by him and falls into di&s;cour&s;e: Afterwards tho&s;e of the common &s;ort come asking him after the &s;ame manner, whe|ther he be come? And having thereupon brought him &s;ome|thing to eat, they al&s;o fall into di&s;cour&s;e with him: True it is indeed, that our In&s;ulary <HI>Caribbians,</HI> in the reception of their Gue&s;ts, towards tho&s;e of their own Nation, who are &s;trangers in their I&s;lands, practi&s;e the &s;ame thing as the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Continent: But when they entertain <HI>French</HI> and other <HI>Europ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ans</HI> who would be loth to keep &s;ilence &s;o long, they &s;peak to them, and fall immediately into di&s;cour&s;e, as we &s;aid before, ac|commodating them&s;elves to their humour, and, to comply with them, cro&s;&s;ing the rules of their own Ceremonies.</P>
<P>But the Banquet they intend them was prepared before hand, let us now &s;ee how it is ordered, and how they demean them|&s;elves therein: They give every one his little Table, and his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut, <HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 7.</NOTE> Me&s;&s;es apart, as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do: Somebring in broil'd Lizards; others, fry'd Crabs; &s;ome, Pul&s;e; and others, Fruits, and &s;o of the re&s;t: During the Repa&s;t, they di&s;cour&s;e with them, and wait on them with the greate&s;t care imaginable: They think it the greate&s;t kindne&s;s can be done them to eat and drink hearti|ly; and all their bu&s;ine&s;s is to fill the Cups, and &s;ee that every Table be furni&s;hed: When a man drinks he mu&s;t take all off, otherwi&s;e they are di&s;obliged; and if one cannot eat all the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> that is given him, he mu&s;t put up the re&s;t and carry it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rusbequius, <HI>lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> along with him, otherwi&s;e they will take it unkindly: Thus the <HI>Turks</HI> when they are at a friends Table, are wont to fill their Handkerchers, and &s;ometimes the &s;leeves of their Garments with fragments of meat and bread, which they carry away with them. And among the <HI>Grand-Tartars,</HI> when a Gue&s;t cannot eat all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rubriques <HI>in his Tra|vels into</HI> Tartary.</NOTE> that is pre&s;ented to him, he mu&s;t give the remainders to his Servant to lay up for him, or carry it away him&s;elf in his bag or pouch, wherein he puts up al&s;o the bones, if he hath not pick|ed them clean enough, that he may afterwards do it at his lea|&s;ure: But among the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> when the Gue&s;t goes home, the Servants of the per&s;on who invited him, carries along with him the di&s;hes that were left.</P>
<P>After the Repa&s;t, the <HI>Caribbians</HI> conduct you to their pri|vate Hou&s;es, and into their Gardens, &s;hew you their Arms,
<PB N="312" REF="170">
their curio&s;ities and their trinkets, and pre&s;ent you with Fruits, or &s;ome little pieces of their own workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>If any one be de&s;irous to continue a while among them, they take it for a great favour, and are extreamly glad of it, and find the &s;ame treatment as at fir&s;t: But if they are willing to be gone from them, they are troubled, and ask whether you di&s;like your entertainment, that you &s;hould be gone &s;o &s;oon. With that &s;ad countenance they all re-conduct you to the Sea|&s;ide, nay will carry you into your Shallops, if you will &s;uffer it: And at that final parting they again pre&s;ent you with fruits, which they force you to accept, &s;aying to tho&s;e who would re|fu&s;e them, <HI>Friend, if thou hast no need of it thy &s;elf, thou may&s;t give it to thy Marriners;</HI> &s;o they call all the Servants and Dome|&s;ticks of tho&s;e to whom they &s;peak. The <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> and the <HI>Cana|dians,</HI> as &s;ome affirm, do al&s;o make pre&s;ents upon the like occa|&s;ions: And <HI>Tacitus</HI> relates, that the ancient <HI>Germans</HI> made pre|&s;ents to the Strangers who came to vi&s;it them; but they reci|procally demanded &s;omething of them: In this point the <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> &s;hew them&s;elves more generous, for they give, and re|quire nothing back in lieu of it.</P>
<P>But it would be an incivility to go and vi&s;it the&s;e good peo|ple and to receive their kindne&s;&s;es, and not to pre&s;ent them with &s;omething: Whence it comes that the Strangers, who go to &s;ee them, never go without &s;ome grains of Chry&s;tal, Fi&s;hing-hooks, Needles, Pins, or little Knives, or &s;ome &s;uch toies: And a&s;|&s;oon as they have done eating, they &s;et on the little Table, on which they have eaten, &s;ome of tho&s;e things: Tho&s;e who have prepared the Banquet think them&s;elves requited a hundred-fold, and make extraordinary acknowledgments thereof.</P>
<P>We have hitherto repre&s;ented what treatment the <HI>Caribbi|ans</HI> have heretofore made to &s;ome of their friends, <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who took occa&s;ion to vi&s;it them: But they u&s;e other Ceremonies at the reception of Strangers of their own Nation, or their Confederates, who chance to come into their I&s;lands: There is in every <HI>Carbet</HI> a Savage, who hath a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to receive Pa&s;&s;engers, and is called <HI>Niouakaiti:</HI> If they are of the common &s;ort, he pre&s;ents them with Seats, and what is fit for them to eat, e&s;pecially a <HI>Ca&s;sava</HI>-cake folded double, which &s;ignifies that they may eat as much as they can, and leave the re&s;t behind them.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who come to &s;ee them, or pa&s;s by occa&s;ionally are con&s;iderable to them upon any other account, as being &s;ome way related to them, or Captains, they comb their hair both at their coming and their going away, they hang up Beds, and invite them to re&s;t them&s;elves, &s;aying, <HI>En Bouekra,</HI> behold thy Bed: They al&s;o pre&s;ent them with <HI>Matoutous,</HI> which are little Tables made of Ru&s;hes, or the leaves of Palms or <HI>Lataniers,</HI>

as we &s;aid el&s;ewhere, on which they &s;et the meat and the <HI>Ca&s;sa|va</HI> not folded, but as they come off the Plank: The women &s;et them at their feet, and the men &s;tanding about, &s;hew that which was brought, &s;aying, <HI>En Yerebaili, behold thy meat:</HI> Af|terwards the women bring in Gourds full of <HI>Ou&iuml;cou,</HI> and make them drink: Then having &s;et them on the ground before them, the Husband who &s;tands behind the women, &s;ays, <HI>En batoni, behold thy drink:</HI> And the other makes an&s;wer to the&s;e two complements, <HI>Yao,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>very well,</HI> or <HI>I thank you.</HI> The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> unfolded &s;ignifies, eat thy fill and carry away the re&s;t; which they fail not to do: When they have dined well without being interrupted by any one, they all come to &s;alute them one after another, &s;aying to him, <HI>Halea-tibou,</HI> that is, <HI>be welcome:</HI> But the women are not much concerned in this Ce|remony.

their Armies, and he is always highly re&s;pected among them: He appoints the meetings of the <HI>Carbet,</HI> either for merry-making or deliberations in order to a War: And he alwaies goes abroad attended by all of his own hou&s;e, and &s;ome others who do him the honour to wait on him: Tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t retinue are the mo&s;t highly honoured: If any one gives him not the re&s;pect due to him upon the account of his charge, it is in his power to &s;trike him: Of the&s;e there are but two at the mo&s;t in an I&s;land, as at <HI>Dominico:</HI> They are al&s;o commonly the Admirals when a Fleet goes out: Or haply that charge is be|&s;towed on &s;ome young man, who is de&s;irous to &s;ignalize him|&s;elf upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This charge is obtain'd by election: and commonly he who is advanced thereto mu&s;t have killed divers of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> or at lea&s;t one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons among them. The Sons do not &s;ucceed their Fathers in that charge, if they be not worthy thereof. When the chief Captain &s;peaks all others are &s;ilent: and when he enters into the <HI>Carbet,</HI> every one makes him way; he hath al&s;o the fir&s;t and be&s;t part of the entertain|ment: The Lieutenant to this Captain is called in their Lan|guage <HI>Ouboutou maliarici,</HI> that is to &s;ay properly, the <HI>Track of the Captain,</HI> or <HI>that which appears after him.</HI></P>
<P>None of the&s;e Chiefs hath any command over the whole Na|tion nor any &s;uperiority over the other Captains: But when the <HI>Caribbians</HI> go to the Wars, among all the Captains they make choice of one to be General of the Army, who makes the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault: and when the expedition is over, he hath no autho|rity but only in his own I&s;land: True it is, that if he hath behav'd him&s;elf gallantly in his enterpri&s;es, he is ever after highly re|&s;pected in all the I&s;lands: But heretofore, before the commerce between the <HI>Caribbians</HI> and forreign Nations had alter'd the greate&s;t part of their ancient Politie, there were many condi|tions requi&s;ite to obtain that degree of honour.</P>
<P>It was in the fir&s;t place requi&s;ite that he whom they advanc'd to that dignity, had been &s;everal times in the Wars, and that to the knowledge of the whole I&s;land whereof he was to be cho&s;en Captain, he had behaved him&s;elf couragiou&s;ly and gal|lantly: Next to this it was nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould be &s;o active and &s;wift in running, as to &s;urpa&s;s all competitors in that exerci&s;e: Thirdly, he who &s;tood for the General&s;hip of an I&s;land, &s;hould excell all others in &s;wimming and diving: A fourth condition was, that he &s;hould carry a burthen of &s;uch weight as his fellow-pretenders &s;hould not be able to &s;tand un|der: La&s;tly, he was obliged to give great demon&s;trations of his con&s;tancy: for they cruelly cut and mangled his &s;houlders and brea&s;ts with the tooth of an <HI>Agouty;</HI> nay his be&s;t friends made deep inci&s;ions in divers parts of his body: And the wretched per&s;on who expected that charge was to endure all this, with|out
<PB N="315" REF="171" MS="y">
betraying the lea&s;t &s;ign of re&s;entment and pain; nay, on the contrary, it was requi&s;ite that he receiv'd all with a &s;miling countenance, as if he were the mo&s;t &s;atisfied man in the World: We &s;hall not wonder &s;o much that the&s;e Barbarians &s;hould en|dure &s;uch Torments, in order to the acqui&s;ition of &s;ome Dig|nity, when it &s;hall be con&s;idered, that the <HI>Turks</HI> do not &s;hew them&s;elves &s;omtimes le&s;s cruel towards them&s;elves, upon the account of pure gallantry, and as it were by way of diverti&s;e|ments witne&s;s what is related by <HI>Busbequius</HI> in the fourth Book of his <HI>Emba&s;&s;ies,</HI> which were too tedious to &s;et down in this place.</P>
<P>To return to the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the I&s;lands: This ancient ce|remony, which they ob&s;erved in the election of their chief Go|vernours, will no doubt be thought &s;trange and &s;avage; but there is &s;omthing of the &s;ame kind ob&s;ervable in other Nations: For in the Kingdom of <HI>Chili</HI> they chu&s;e for the Sovereign Captain him who is able longe&s;t to bear a great Tree upon his &s;houlders: In the Country of <HI>Wiapoco,</HI> towards the great River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> to be advanc'd to the dignity of Captain, he mu&s;t endure, without the lea&s;t &s;tirring of the Body, nine extra|ordinary &s;trokes with a Holly-wand from every Captain, and that three &s;everal times; but that is not all; he mu&s;t al&s;o be put into a Bed of Cotton, over a Fire of green Leaves, the thick Smoke whereof a&s;cending upwards, mu&s;t needs be very trou|ble&s;om to the wretch who is &s;o mad as to expo&s;e him&s;elf there|to; and he is oblig'd to continue there till he be in a manner half dead; this &s;peaks a &s;trange de&s;ire to be Captain: Nay, heretofore among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> tho&s;e who were de&s;irous to be admitted into the Fraternity of the Sun, were requir'd to give proofs of their Con&s;tancy in four&s;core &s;everal &s;orts of Tor|ments: The <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> without any other ceremony, make choice of him for their General who hath taken and kill'd mo&s;t Enemies: And now al&s;o in &s;ome of the <HI>Caribbies</HI> the <HI>Caribbians</HI> them&s;elves laugh at their ancient Ceremonies at the election of their Captain; for having ob&s;erv'd that their Neighbours think that kind of proceeding ridiculous, they now make choice of him for their Chief, who having behav'd him&s;elf valiantly in the Wars again&s;t their Enemies, hath acquir'd the reputation of a brave and gallant per&s;on.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Cacick</HI> is receiv'd into his Charge, he is highly re&s;pected by all, in&s;omuch that no man &s;peaks if he do not ask or command him to do it; and if any one cannot forbear &s;peak|ing as he ought, all the re&s;t immediately cry out, <HI>Cala la bocca,</HI> which they have learn'd from the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> But it &s;uffices not to be &s;ilent in the pre&s;ence of their Chief, but they are al|&s;o very attentive to his Di&s;cour&s;e, look upon him when he &s;peaks; and to &s;hew that they approve of what he &s;ays, they are wont to &s;mile, and that &s;mile is accompanied by a certain <HI>Hun-Hun.</HI></P>

<P>From what hath been &s;aid it may be deduc'd, That this Worlds Honour, whatever it may be, Virtue excepted, con|&s;i&s;ts only in Opinion and Cu&s;tom, which differ, and &s;omtimes cla&s;h, according to the diver&s;ity of Mens humours.</P>

<P>The admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> is not exercis'd by the Captain, nor by any Magi&s;trate; but, as it is among the <HI>Tapinambous,</HI> he who thinks him&s;elf injur'd gets

&s;uch &s;atisfaction of his adver&s;ary as he thinks fit, according as his pa&s;&s;ion dictates to him, or his &s;trength permits him: The Publick does not concern it &s;elf at all in the puni&s;hment of Cri|minals; and if any one among them &s;uffers an injury or affront, without endeavouring to revenge him&s;elf, he is &s;lighted by all the re&s;t, and accounted a Coward, and a Per&s;on of no e&s;teem; But, as we &s;aid before, there happen few quarrels or fallings out among them.</P>
<P>A Brother revenges his Brother and Si&s;ter, a Husband his Wife, a Father his Children; &s;o that when any one is kill'd, they think it ju&s;tly done, becau&s;e it is done upon the account of revenge and retaliation: To prevent that, if a Savage of one I&s;land hath kill'd another Savage, out of a fear of being kill'd by way of revenge by the Relations of the decea&s;ed, he gets into another I&s;land and &s;etles him&s;elf there.

<P>But to return to the Councels of War of our <HI>Caribbians:</HI> When they begin to have their brains warm'd with their drink, an old Woman comes into the A&s;&s;embly with a &s;ad countenance and deportment, and with tears in her eyes de|mands audience; which being ea&s;ily granted her, by rea&s;on of the re&s;pect and reverence they bear to her age, with a doleful voice, interrupted by &s;ighs, &s;he repre&s;ents the injuries which the whole Nation hath receiv'd from the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> their an|cient and inveterate Enemies: And having reckon'd up the greate&s;t cruelties which they have heretofore exercis'd again&s;t the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> and the gallant men they have kill'd or taken in the Battels that were fought between them, &s;he comes to particularize in tho&s;e who were lately made Pri&s;oners, ma&s;&s;a|cred, and eaten, in &s;ome later Engagements: And at la&s;t &s;he concludes, that it were a &s;hameful and an in&s;upportable di&s;|paragement to their Nation, if they &s;hould not revenge them|&s;elves, and generou&s;ly imitate their Predece&s;&s;ors, tho&s;e brave <HI>Caribbians,</HI> who minded nothing &s;o much as to gain &s;atisfacti|on for the injuries they had receiv'd; and who after they had &s;haken off the yoke, which the Tyrants would have impos'd on them for the taking away of their ancient Liberty, have carried their victorious Arms into the Territories of their Enemies, whom they have pur&s;u'd with darts and fire, and forc'd to make their retreats into their highe&s;t Mountains, the clefts of Rocks, and the dreadful rece&s;&s;es of their thicke&s;t Fore&s;ts; and this with &s;o great &s;ucce&s;s, that at pre&s;ent they dare not appear at their own Sea-coa&s;ts, and can find no habi|tation &s;o remote where they think them&s;elves &s;ecure from the a&s;&s;aults of the <HI>Caribbians;</HI> fear and a&s;toni&s;hment having been their con&s;tant attendants after &s;uch &s;ignal Victories: That they are therefore couragiou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute their advantages, and not to re&s;t till that pe&s;tilent Enemy be utterly de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the old Woman hath made an end of her di&s;|cour&s;e, the Captain makes a Speech to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to make a greater impre&s;&s;ion in the minds of the Audience; which ended, the whole A&s;&s;embly unanimou&s;ly applauds the Propo&s;ition, and make all demon&s;trations imaginable of the ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e. From that time, being encourag'd by the words they had heard, they breathe nothing but blood and wounds. The Captain, concluding by the applau&s;e of the whole A&s;&s;embly, and by their ge&s;tures and countenances, that
<PB N="319" REF="173">
they are re&s;olv'd for the War, though they do not &s;ay &s;o much, immediately orders it, and appoints the time for the Enter|prize by &s;ome of their ways of numbring, as we have hinted in the Chapter of their <HI>Natural Simplicity.</HI> In this place we are to make this particular Remark, That they take the&s;e bloody re&s;olutions when they are well loaden with drink, and after the Divel hath tormented them to egge them on thereto, as we have &s;aid el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The next day after the A&s;&s;embly, nothing is &s;een or heard in all parts of the I&s;land but preparations for the War: Some poli&s;h their Bows; others order their Clubs; others prepare, &s;harpen, and poi&s;on their Arrows; and others are employ'd to make ready the <HI>Piragas:</HI> The Women, for their parts, are bu&s;ie about di&s;po&s;ing and getting together the nece&s;&s;ary provi|&s;ions for the Army: So that on the day appointed they all meet at the Sea-&s;ide with all things in a readine&s;s to embarque.</P>
<P>They all furni&s;h them&s;elves with good Bows, and every one with a good &s;heaf of Arrows, which are made of a &s;mall &s;mooth Reed, with a little piece of iron or &s;ome &s;harp bone at the point: The Arrows us'd by the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are made after the &s;ame manner; but the <HI>Caribbians</HI> adde to theirs, to make them more dreadful, a mortal poi&s;on made of the juice of the <HI>Manchenillo</HI>-trees, and other poi&s;ons; &s;o that the lea&s;t &s;cratch made by them becomes a mortal wound. It hath hitherto been a thing impo&s;&s;ible to get out of them the Receipt of that compo&s;ition. They have al&s;o every one of them that wooden &s;word which they call <HI>Boutous,</HI> or to &s;ay better, that ma&s;&s;y Club which they u&s;e in&s;tead of a &s;word, and wherewith they do miracles in point of fencing. The&s;e are all their Arms; for they have no Targets or Bucklers, as the <HI>Tapinambous,</HI> but<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, <HI>c.</HI> 14.</NOTE> their bodies are naked.</P>
<P>Next the care they take about their Arms, they al&s;o pro|vide them&s;elves &s;ufficiently with belly-timber, and take along with them in their little ve&s;&s;els good quantities of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava,</HI> broil'd Fi&s;h, Fruits, and particularly <HI>Bananas,</HI> which keep a long time, and the meal of <HI>Manioc.</HI> The <HI>Icaque&s;es</HI> in their Wars never trouble them&s;elves about any &s;uch thing; and what they do in this particular is &s;o peculiar to them, that it de&s;erves to be mentioned: for they are content with &s;o little &s;ontheir &s;u&s;tenance, and delight &s;o much in living upon certain Plumbs which grow abundantly in their Parts, and from which they have their name, that when they go to the Wars they are never &s;een to carry any provi&s;ions for the belly along with them.</P>

<P>Their cu&s;tom is to go from I&s;land to I&s;land to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and to that end they have Gardens even in tho&s;e which are de&s;ert, and not inhabited: They al&s;o touch at the I&s;lands of their own Nation, to joyn their Forces, and take in as they go along all tho&s;e that are in a condition to ac|company them; and &s;o their Army increa&s;es, and with that equipage they get with little noi&s;e to the Frontiers.</P>
<P>When they &s;ail along the Coa&s;ts, and night comes upon them, they bring their Ve&s;&s;els a&s;hore, and in half an hours time they make up their lodging-place under &s;ome Tree with <HI>Bali&s;ier</HI> and <HI>Latanier</HI>-leaves, which they fa&s;ten together on poles or reeds, &s;u&s;tain'd by forks planted in the ground, which &s;erve for a foundation to this little &s;tructure, and to hang their beds on: The&s;e lodgings thus made in ha&s;te they call <HI>Aioupa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Law-giver had forbidden, among other<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plut. <HI>in the Life of</HI> Ly|curgus.</NOTE> things, that War &s;hould be always wag'd again&s;t the &s;ame Enemies, for fear they might thereby grow more experienc'd in Military Affairs: But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> follow not tho&s;e Ma|ximes, nor fear any &s;uch inconvenience; for they always make War again&s;t the &s;ame Nation: Their ancient and irreconcile|able Enemies are the <HI>Arouacas, Arouaques</HI> or <HI>Arouagues,</HI> which is the name commonly given them in the I&s;lands, though the <HI>Caribbians</HI> call them <HI>Alouagues,</HI> who live in that part of the Meridional <HI>America</HI> which is known in the Maps under the name of the Province of <HI>Guyana</HI> or <HI>Guayana,</HI> not far from the Rivers which fall down out of that Province into the Sea. The cau&s;e of this immortal enmity between our In&s;ulary <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> and tho&s;e people hath been already hinted in the Chapter of the Origine of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> to wit, that tho&s;e <HI>Arouagues</HI> have cruelly per&s;ecuted the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of the Conti|nent, their Neighbours, the Relations of our I&s;landers, and of the &s;ame Nation with them; and that they have continually warr'd again&s;t them to exterminate them, or at lea&s;t, to drive them out of their habitations.

commonly once or twice a year, to be reveng'd of them as much as they can: And it is to be ob&s;erv'd on the other &s;ide, that the <HI>Arouagues</HI> never make any attempts on the <HI>Ca|ribbians</HI> of the I&s;lands, in the I&s;lands where they live, but on|ly &s;tand on the defen&s;ive; whereas they are &s;ure to have our Savages among them oftner then they wi&s;h, coa&s;ting along, as they are wont to do, all the other I&s;lands wherein they have Gardens or Colonies, though the furthermo&s;t of the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands, which is <HI>Santa-Cruce,</HI> is di&s;tant from the Country of the <HI>Arouagues</HI> about three hundred Leagues.</P>

The <HI>Arraucanes,</HI> next neighbour to the <HI>Chili,</HI> a warlike people, and whom the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath not been yet able to overcome, nay was &s;ometimes wor&s;ted by them, do much more: For when they are to engage again&s;t an Enemy, they have the War proclaim'd by Heraulds, and &s;end this me&s;|&s;age to them; <HI>We &s;hall meet thee within &s;o many Moons, be rea|dy.</HI> And &s;o the <HI>Yncas,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Peru,</HI> never undertook any<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garcila&s;. <HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 12.</NOTE> war, till they had fir&s;t advertis'd their Enemies thereof, and declar'd it two or three times: Whence it may be inferred by the way, that <HI>L' E&s;carbot</HI> is mi&s;taken in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>New-France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 3. c. 25.</NOTE> where he affirms, that all the <HI>We&s;t-Indians</HI> generally wage their wars by &s;urprize.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> have this imagination, that the War they &s;hould begin openly would not pro&s;per: So that having landed in the Country of the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> if they are di&s;covered before they give the fir&s;t &s;hock, or that a dog, as one would &s;ay, did bark at them, thinking it ominous, they immediately return to their Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o to their I&s;lands, leaving the de&s;ign to be pro&s;ecuted &s;ome other time.</P>
<P>But if they are not di&s;covered, they fall upon their Ene|mies even in their Hou&s;es: If they cannot ea&s;ily come at them, or find them well fortified in &s;ome Hou&s;es that have good Pali|&s;adoes, whence they play upon them with their Arrows with &s;ome advantage, they are wont to force them out by &s;hooting fire to the Hou&s;es with their Arrows, at the points whereof they fa&s;ten lighted Cotton: And the&s;e arrows being &s;hot on the roofs, which con&s;i&s;t of Gra&s;s or Palm-leaves, they pre&s;ently &s;et them on fire: Thus the <HI>Arouagues</HI> are forced out of their

holes, and to fight in the open field, or run away: When our Savages have thus gotten them into the field, they pre&s;ently &s;hoot away all their arrows, which being &s;pent they take their <HI>Boutous,</HI> and do &s;trange things therewith; they are in perpetual motion all the time they are fighting, that the Enemy may have the le&s;s time to ob&s;erve them: Fire-arms, e&s;pecially great Guns, which make &s;o great noi&s;e, and do &s;uch execution, e&s;pe|cially when they are loaden with Nails, Chains, and other pie|ces of old Iron, have abated much of their courage when they have had to do with <HI>Europaeans,</HI> and makes them afraid to come neer their Ships and Forts: But though they do not take <HI>Opi|um,</HI> to make them le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of danger, before they go to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Travels of</HI> Villamont <HI>lib.</HI> 2.

Thus did the warlike Savages of the Country of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> when they were a&s;&s;aulted by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lin&s;cot <HI>&amp;</HI> de Laet.</NOTE> they fell in among them with &s;uch fury, both men and women, that a young maid laid &s;everal <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon the place ere &s;he was killed her &s;elf. They &s;ay al&s;o that the <HI>Mexicans</HI> and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acco&s;ta <HI>&amp;</HI> le Jeune</NOTE> <HI>Canadians</HI> will rather be cut to pieces than taken in fight.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Caribbians</HI> can take any one of their Enemies alive, they bind him and bring him away captive into their I&s;lands; but if any one of theirs fall dead or wounded in the field, it would be an eternal and in&s;upportable reproach to them to leave him in the power of the Enemy: That con&s;ideration makes them break furiou&s;ly into the mid&s;t of the greate&s;t dan|gers, and re&s;olutely make their way through whatever op|po&s;es them, to retrive the bodies of their Comrades; and ha|ving gotten them by force from among&s;t the Enemies, they carry them to their Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>When the fight is over, our Savages make their retreat to the Sea-&s;ide, or into &s;ome neighbouring I&s;land; and if they have received &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;s by the death of &s;ome of their Chief Commanders, or their mo&s;t valiant Soldiers, they fill the air with dreadful howling and crying before they get into their Ve&s;&s;els; and intermixing their tears with the blood of the decea&s;ed, they mournfully di&s;po&s;e them into their <HI>Piragas,</HI> and accompany them with their regrets and &s;ighs to &s;ome of their own Territories.</P>
<P>But when they have had the Victory, they &s;pend not the time in cutting off the heads of their &s;lain Enemies, in carrying them in triumph, and in taking the skins of tho&s;e poor bodies, to make Standards in their Triumphs, as the <HI>Canadians</HI> do, and as heretofore was the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Scythians,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> af|firms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4.</NOTE>

<P>The end they propo&s;e to them&s;elves in the&s;e Expeditions, is not to become Ma&s;ters of a new Country, or to load them|&s;elves with the &s;poils of their Enemies; but only the glory of &s;ubduing and triumphing over them, and the plea&s;ure of &s;a|tiating their Revenge for the injuries they have received from them.</P>
<P>Next the <HI>Arouagues,</HI> the greate&s;t Enemies the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have are the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> this enmity took its ri&s;e hence, that the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> having under the Flags of other Nations got divers of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> aboard their Ships, where they had at fir&s;t charmed them with kindne&s;s, and little pre&s;ents, e&s;pecially <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> which they extreamly love; when they &s;aw their Ve&s;&s;el full of the&s;e poor people, who never dreamed of any &s;uch treachery, weighed anchor, and carried the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> men, women, and children into their Plantations, where they are &s;till kept as &s;laves: It is reported that they did the like in &s;everal of the I&s;lands, wherein they followed the example of the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> Whence it comes that they &s;till bear a grudge to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and can hardly endure to hear their Language &s;poken: Nay, their di&s;&s;atisfaction is &s;o great, that if a <HI>French</HI>|man, as &s;ome of that Nation affirm, chance to make u&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> expre&s;&s;ions in his di&s;cour&s;e, he runs the hazard of their enmity: Accordingly, in their turns, by the law of retaliation, they have often made incur&s;ions into the I&s;lands of <HI>Mont&s;errat, Antego,</HI> and others which are in the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and after they had &s;et &s;ome hou&s;es on fire, and taken &s;ome Goods, they carried away men, women, and children, whom they brought to <HI>Dominico</HI> and St. <HI>Vincents;</HI> but it was never heard that they did eat any of them, it &s;eems they re&s;erve that cruel|ty for the <HI>Arouagues:</HI> Nay before the <HI>Caribbians</HI> had any war with the Inhabitants or <HI>Martinico,</HI> when the Parents or Friends of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who had been carried away Pri&s;oners of War by tho&s;e <HI>Caribbians,</HI> employed the mediation of the <HI>French,</HI> they were ea&s;ily enlarged and put into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> who gave the <HI>Caribbians</HI> in exchange for them, &s;ome of tho&s;e trifles which they highly value, or haply an Iron wedge, or &s;ome &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary tool: Nay, upon the pre&s;enting them with &s;ome of tho&s;e things they have delivered up &s;ome of the <HI>Arou|agues</HI>

<P>As for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at the fir&s;t di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Caribbians</HI> who were then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the <HI>Caribby</HI>-I&s;lands, were cruelly treated by them; they per&s;ecuted them with fire and &s;word, and pur&s;u'd them even into the woods, as wild bea&s;ts, that they might carry them away Captives to work in the Mines: Which kind of procedure forc'd this people, which is valiant and generous, to oppo&s;e the violence, and to lay am|bu&s;hes for their Enemies, nay to a&s;&s;ault them in their Ships which lay in their Roads, which they borded without any fear of fire-Arms, making their way through Swords and Pikes: In which attempts they were many times &s;o fortunate, that they became Ma&s;ters of divers Ships richly loaden, di&s;patching all that oppos'd them, carrying away all the booty, and then &s;et|ing the Ships on fire: True it is, they pardoned the <HI>Negro-&s;laves</HI> they met with, and having brought them a&s;hore put them to work in their Habitations; thence came the <HI>Negroes</HI> which which they have at pre&s;ent in St. <HI>Vincents</HI> and &s;ome other I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, and perceiving they had a &s;tubborn Enemy to deal with, and that when they had ruin'd that Nation, they &s;hould not advantage them&s;elves; and con&s;idering further, that the I&s;lands they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lay convenient for their Ships in their long Voyages, to take in refre&s;hments of water, wood, and provi&s;ions if need were, and to leave &s;uch as were &s;ick in their Fleet, they re&s;olved to treat the <HI>Caribbians</HI> more kindly; and thereupon having &s;et &s;ome of them at liberty whom they had Captives, and &s;ent them back into their Country with pre&s;ents, they made u&s;e of them to treat concerning a peace with that People, the conditions whereof being accepted by &s;ome of the I&s;lands, they &s;et a&s;hore therein &s;ome &s;wine which they had brought out of <HI>Europe;</HI> and afterwards they left there behind them the &s;ick they had in their Ships, and took them in again recovered at their return. But the <HI>Caribbians</HI> of St. <HI>Vincents,</HI> and tho&s;e who lived at <HI>Do|minico</HI> would not con&s;ent to that agreement, but &s;till per&s;i&s;t in the aver&s;ion they had for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the de&s;ire they have to be revenged of them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> Of the Treatment which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> make their Pri&s;oners of War.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now going to dip our Pen in Blood, and to draw a Picture which mu&s;t rai&s;e horrour in the beholder; in this there mu&s;t appear nothing but Inhumanity, Barbari&s;m, and Rage; We &s;hall find rational Creatures cruelly devouring tho&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>&s;pecies</HI> with them, and filling them&s;elves with their Fle&s;h and Blood, after they had ca&s;t off Humane Nature, and put on that of the mo&s;t bloody and furious Bea&s;ts: A thing which the Pagans them&s;elves, in the mid&s;t of their darkne&s;s, heretofore thought &s;o full of execration, that they imagin'd the Sun withdrew him&s;elf, becau&s;e he would not &s;hew his light at &s;uch Repa&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Cannibals,</HI> or <HI>Anthropophagi,</HI> that is, <HI>Eaters of Men</HI> (for here it is that we are properly to call them by that Name, which is common to them with that of the <HI>Caribbians</HI>); when I &s;ay they bring home Pri&s;oner of War from among the <HI>Arou|agues,</HI> he belongs of right to him who either &s;eiz'd on him in the Fight, or took him running away; &s;o that being come in|to his I&s;land, he keeps him in his hou&s;e; and that he may not get away in the night, he ties him in an <HI>Amac,</HI> which he hangs up almo&s;t at the roof of his dwelling; and after he has kept him fa&s;ting four or five days, he produces him upon &s;ome day of &s;olemn debauch, to &s;erve for a publick Victim to the immor|tal hatred of his Country-men towards that Nation.</P>
<P>If there be any of their Enemies dead upon the place, they there eat them ere they leave it: They de&s;ign for &s;lavery only the young Maids and Women taken in the War: They do not eat the Children of their She-pri&s;oners, much le&s;s the Children they have by them them&s;elves: They have heretofore ta&s;ted of all the Nations that frequented them, and affirm, That the <HI>French</HI> are the mo&s;t delicate, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of harde&s;t di|ge&s;tion; but now they do not feed on any Chri&s;tians at all.</P>
<P>They ab&s;tain al&s;o from &s;everal cruelties which they were wont to u&s;e before they kill'd their Enemies; for whereas at pre&s;ent they think it enough to di&s;patch them at a blow or two with the Club, and afterwards cut them into pieces, and having broyl'd them, to devour them; they heretofore put them to &s;everal torments, before they gave them the mortal blow: We &s;hall not think it be&s;ides our purpo&s;e to &s;et down in this place &s;ome of the inhumanities which they exercis'd upon the&s;e &s;ad occa&s;ions, as they them&s;elves have given an account thereof to
<PB N="327" REF="177">
tho&s;e have had the curio&s;ity to inform them&s;elves from their own mouths.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner of War who had been &s;o unfortunate as to fall into their hands, and was not ignorant that he was de&s;ign'd to receive the mo&s;t cruel treatment which rage could &s;ugge&s;t, arm'd him&s;elf with con&s;tancy, and, to expre&s;s how generous a people the <HI>Arouagues</HI> were, march'd very chearfully to the place of execution, not being either bound or drag'd thereto, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf with a &s;miling and &s;teady countenance in the mid&s;t of the A&s;&s;embly, which he knew de&s;ir'd nothing &s;o much as his death.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he perceiv'd tho&s;e people who expre&s;s'd &s;o great joy at the approach of him, who was to be the me&s;s of their abominable Entertainment, not expecting their di&s;cour&s;es and their bitter abu&s;es, he prevented them in the&s;e termes; <Q>I know well enough upon what account you have brought me to this place; I doubt not but you are de&s;irous to fill your &s;elves with my blood, and that you are impatient to exerci&s;e your teeth upon my body; but you have not &s;o much rea&s;on to triumph to &s;ee me in this condition, nor I much to be troubled there|at: My Country-men have put your Predece&s;&s;ors to greater mi&s;eries than you are now able to invent again&s;t me; and I have done my part with them in mangling, ma&s;&s;acring, and devouring your people, your friends, and your fathers; be|&s;ides that I have Relations who will not fail to revenge my quarrel with advantage upon you and upon your Children, for the mo&s;t inhumane treatment you intend again&s;t me: What torments &s;oever the mo&s;t ingenious cruelty can dictate to you for the taking away of my life, is nothing in compa|ri&s;on of tho&s;e which my generous Nation prepares for you in exchange: therefore delay not the utmo&s;t of your cruelty any longer, and a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves I both &s;light and laugh at it.</Q> Somwhat of this nature is that brave and bloody Bra|vado which may be read of a <HI>Bra&s;ilian</HI> Pri&s;oner, ready to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montagn'<HI>s E&s;&s;ays,</HI> l. 1. c. 30.</NOTE> devour'd by his Enemies; <Q>Come on boldly, <HI>&s;aid be to them,</HI> and fea&s;t your &s;elves upon me; for at the &s;ame time you will feed on your Fathers and Grandfathers, who &s;erv'd for nouri&s;hment to my Body: The&s;e Mu&s;cles, this Fle&s;h, and the&s;e Veins are yours, blind Fools as you are; you do not ob&s;erve, that the &s;ub&s;tance of the Members of your Ance|&s;tors are yet to be &s;een in them; ta&s;te them well, and you will find the ta&s;te of your own Fle&s;h.</Q> But let us return to our <HI>Arouagues.</HI></P>
<P>His &s;oul was not only in his lips, but &s;hew'd it &s;elf al&s;o in the effects which follow'd that Bravado; for after the Company had a while endur'd his menaces and arrogant defiances with|out touching him, one among them came and burnt his &s;ides with a flaming brand; another cut good deep pieces out of him,
<PB N="328" REF="178">
and would have made them bigger, had it not been for the bones, in &s;everal parts of the body: Then they ca&s;t into his &s;marting wounds that &s;harp kind of Spice which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> call <HI>Pyman:</HI> Others diverted them&s;elves in &s;hooting Arrows at the poor Patient; and every one took a plea&s;ure in tormenting him; but he &s;uffer'd with the &s;ame countenance, and expre&s;|&s;ed not the lea&s;t &s;entiment of pain: After they had made &s;port thus a long time with the poor wretch, at la&s;t growing weary of in&s;ulting, and out-brav'd by his con&s;tancy, which &s;eem'd &s;till the &s;ame, one of them came and at one blow di&s;patch'd him with his Club. This is the Treatment which the <HI>Caribbi|ans</HI> made heretofore to their Pri&s;oners of War; but now they think it enough to put them to a &s;peedy death, as we have al|ready repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this unfortunate per&s;on is thus laid dead upon the place, the young men take the body, and having wa&s;h'd it cut it in pieces, and then boyl &s;ome part, and broil &s;ome upon wooden Frames, made for that purpo&s;e, like Gridirons: When this dete&s;table Di&s;h is ready, and &s;ea&s;on'd according to their palates, they divide it into &s;o many parts as there are per&s;ons pre&s;ent, and joyfully devour it, thinking that the World can|not afford any other repa&s;t equally delicious: The Women lick the very &s;ticks on which the fat of the <HI>Arouague</HI> dropp'd; which proceeds not &s;o much from the deliciou&s;ne&s;s they find in that kind of &s;u&s;tenance, and that fat, as from the exce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ure they conceive in being reveng'd in that manner of their chiefe&s;t Enemies.</P>
<P>But as they would be extreamly troubled that the enraged hatred they bear the <HI>Arouagues</HI> &s;hould ever end, &s;o do they make it their main endeavour to foment and heighten it: thence it comes, that while this poor Carca&s;s is a dre&s;&s;ing, they care|fully gather and &s;ave all the fat that comes from it; not to put into Medicines, as Chirurgeons &s;ometimes do; or to make wild|fire of it, to &s;et their Enemies hou&s;es on fire, as the <HI>Tartars</HI> do; but they gather together that fat to be afterwards di&s;tributed among the chiefe&s;t of them, who carefully keep it in little Gourds, to pour &s;ome few drops thereof into their Sauces at their &s;olemn Entertainments, &s;o to perpetuate, as much as lies in their power, the motive of their Revenge.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXII.</HI> Of the Marriages of the <HI>Caribbians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are in <HI>America</HI> &s;ome Savages &s;o &s;avage and &s;o bru|ti&s;h, that they know not what Marriage is, but go in|differently together like bea&s;ts. This, among others, is af|firm'd of the ancient <HI>Peruvians,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garcil. <HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 14. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15. <HI>&amp; l.</HI> 7. <HI>c.</HI> 17.</NOTE> I&s;lands of <HI>Robbers:</HI> But the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> with all their barba|ri&s;m, &s;ubject them&s;elves to the Laws of this &s;trict Alliance.</P>
<P>They have no &s;et time of the Year appointed for their Mar|riages, as the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who ordinarily marry in the Spring;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strab. <HI>l.</HI> 11.</NOTE> nor yet are they oblig'd to do it at any certain age, as &s;everal other Savages, whereof &s;ome marry commonly at <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>In the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies.</NOTE> nine years; others at <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>At</HI> Mada|ga&s;car.</NOTE> twelve; &s;ome at <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Peru|vians.</NOTE> four and twenty; and others on|ly at <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Flori|dians.</NOTE> forty: Nor is it the cu&s;tom among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> as in a manner among all other Nations, that the young Men &s;hould ordinarily make choice of the Maids according to their own minds and inclinations; nor on the other &s;ide, do the young Maids make choice of their Hu&s;bands, as tho&s;e of the Pro|vince of <HI>Nicaragua</HI> do, at their publick Fea&s;ts and A&s;&s;emblies; and as it was done heretofore in <HI>Candia,</HI> as Hi&s;torians affirm.</P>
<P>But when our Savages are de&s;irous to marry, they have a priviledge to take all their Cou&s;in-germans, and have no more to &s;ay, then that they take them to their Wives; for they are naturally re&s;erv'd for them, and they may carry them to their hou&s;es without any other ceremony, and then they are ac|counted their lawful Wives. They may all take as many Wives as they plea&s;e; e&s;pecially, the Captains pride it much in having a great number of them: They build a particular Hut for every Wife: They continue what time they plea&s;e with her whom they fancy mo&s;t, yet &s;o as that the others con|ceive no jealou&s;ie thereat. She whom they mo&s;t honour with their company, waits on them with the greate&s;t care and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion imaginable; &s;he prepares <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> for them, paints them; and goes along with them in all their Expeditions.</P>
<P>Their Hu&s;bands love them all very well; but this love is like a fire of &s;traw, &s;ince that many times they for&s;ake them with as much ea&s;e as they take them; yet are they &s;eldom &s;een to leave their fir&s;t Wives, e&s;pecially if they have had children by them.</P>
<P>If there chance to be among the She-pri&s;oners of War any that they like, they make them their Wives; but though the children born of them are free, yet are the Mothers, for their parts, &s;till accounted Slaves. All the Wives &s;peak with whom they plea&s;e; but the Hu&s;band dares not di&s;cour&s;e with the Re|lations
<PB N="333" REF="180">
of his Wife, but upon extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>When it happens that any one among them hath no Cou&s;in|germans, or that having &s;taid too long ere they took them to Wives, their friends have di&s;pos'd of them to others, they may now marry &s;uch as are not of any kin to them: but it is requi|&s;ite that they demand them of their Fathers and Mothers, and as &s;oon as the Father or Mother hath granted their reque&s;t, they are their Wives, and they carry them to their own habi|tations.</P>
<P>Before they had alter'd &s;ome part of their ancient Cu&s;toms, by rea&s;on of the conver&s;e they have had with the Chri&s;tians, they took none for their lawful Wives but their Cou&s;ins, who were theirs by natural right, as we &s;aid before, or &s;uch young Maids as their Fathers and Mothers willingly proffer'd them at their return from the Wars. This ancient Cu&s;tom of theirs hath many particular circum&s;tances worthy our remark; and therefore we &s;hall give an account of it at large, as we have it from the mo&s;t ancient of that Nation who have related it, to &s;hew the great changes which have crept into their Manners and Cu&s;toms, &s;ince they became acquainted with forreign Na|tions.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Caribbians</HI> return'd with &s;ucce&s;s from their Wars, and that there was a &s;olemn reception made for them in their I&s;lands, and a great entertainment at their <HI>Carbet,</HI> after that Solemnity, which is &s;till in u&s;e among them, the Captain gave an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of their Expedition, and commended the genero&s;ity and gallantry of tho&s;e who had behav'd them|&s;elves valiantly: But his main de&s;ign was to recommend the valour of the young men, the better to animate them to make future expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame courage upon the like occa&s;ions. It was ordinarily at the end of that di&s;cour&s;e that Fathers of families, who had Daughters marriageable, took occa&s;ion to pre&s;ent them for Wives to tho&s;e among the young men who&s;e performances they had heard &s;o much celebrated, and who&s;e courage and undauntedne&s;s in fighting had been &s;o highly com|mended: There was an emulation among them who &s;hould get &s;uch for their Sons-in-law: And he who had kill'd mo&s;t Ene|mies, had much ado that day to &s;cape with one Wife, &s;o many would there be proffer'd to him: But Cowards and per&s;ons of no worth met with no court&s;hip to that purpo&s;e; &s;o that, to be married among them, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of being cou|ragious; for a Wife in that Nation then was the reward of ge|nero&s;ity. Thus among the <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> the young men were not admitted to marry till they had kill'd &s;ome Enemy: And in a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vin. le Blan. <HI>p.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 30.</NOTE> City of <HI>Grand-Tartary,</HI> called <HI>Palimbrota,</HI> tho&s;e of highe&s;t qua|lity could have no Wives till they had brought proof that they had kill'd three Enemies of their Prince. It is reported al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alex. ab A|lexandro, <HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 24.</NOTE> that heretofore in <HI>Carmania,</HI> if any one were de&s;irous to marry,
<PB N="334" REF="181">
it was requi&s;ite that he brought the King the head of an Ene|my. The &s;ame Cu&s;tom in a manner was ob&s;erv'd among a certain people neer the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea. And who knows not that King <HI>Saul</HI> demanded of <HI>David</HI> the lives of an hundred <HI>Phili|&s;tines,</HI> for the dower of his Daughter, before he gave her him in Marriage?</P>
<P>But happy did that Father think him&s;elf among our <HI>Carib|bians,</HI> who could fir&s;t approach and &s;eize about the body of &s;ome one of tho&s;e valorous Sons-in-Law whom the Captain had commended; for there was nothing to be expected for that time by him that came next; and the marriage was con|cluded as &s;oon as the other had &s;aid to the Young-man, <HI>I be|&s;tow my Daughter on thee for thy Wife;</HI> the like expre&s;&s;ion from a Mother was as effectual: And the Young-man dur&s;t not re|fu&s;e the Daughter when &s;he was thus pre&s;ented to him; but it was requi&s;ite, that whether &s;he were hand&s;ome or unhand&s;ome, he took her to Wife. Thus the <HI>Caribbians</HI> married not after previous court&s;hips and Love-&s;uits.</P>
<P>And if the young <HI>Caribbians,</HI> after they were married, con|tinued the &s;ame gallantry in en&s;uing Wars, they had according|ly other Wives be&s;towed on them at their return: this Poli|gamy is &s;till in u&s;e among them, and it is indeed common among other Barbarians. The <HI>Chile&s;es,</HI> Inhabitants of the I&s;land<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Laets <HI>Hi&s;tory.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Mocha,</HI> make no more ado, but as often as they are de&s;irous to have a new Wife, they buy one for an Ox, a Sheep, or &s;ome other Commodity: And there are &s;ome places where the num|ber of Wives belonging to the &s;ame Husband is prodigious, as in the Kingdom of <HI>Bennin,</HI> the King whereof hath &s;ometimes<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch Relations.</NOTE> &s;even hundred Wives and Concubines; and where the ordina|ry &s;ubjects, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Mexico,</HI> have each of them about a hundred, or a hundred and fifty Wives. On the other &s;ide there are &s;ome places where every Wife in like manner is per|mitted to have many husbands, as among the <HI>Pelhuares,</HI> a Na|tion of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Calecut;</HI> and heretofore in &s;ome of the <HI>Canaries.</HI></P>
<P>The Young-men among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> do not to this day conver&s;e with either Maids or Women till they are married; wherein certainly they are at a great di&s;tance from the humour<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Laet, <HI>Pi|rard, p.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 27. <HI>Conque&s;t of the</HI> Canarys <HI>by</HI> Beren|court.

<PB N="335" REF="181" MS="y">
they give them&s;elves &s;everal cuts and great wounds with their knives, in divers parts of their bodies.</P>
<P>The number of Wives among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> is not limited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirard. <HI>p.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 12.</NOTE> as it is among the <HI>Maldive&s;es,</HI> where a man may have but three at the &s;ame time: But as that number was heretofore propor|tioned to their courage and valour, (for as often as they return|ed from the wars with the commendation of gallant men, they might pretend to &amp; hope for a new Wife) &s;o at the pre&s;ent, they have as many as they de&s;ire and can obtain; &s;o that among them, as well as among the <HI>Topinambous,</HI> he who hath mo&s;t Wives<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Lery, <HI>c.</HI> 17.</NOTE> is accounted mo&s;t valiant, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;on in the whole I&s;land.

Our Savages of the I&s;lands, if they have no more wives than one, are very careful not to be far from them; and if they have many, they vi&s;it them by turns one after another: But in this they ob&s;erve the &s;ame Cu&s;tom with the <HI>Floridians,</HI> that they meddle not with tho&s;e who are with child.</P>

<P>But behold the brutality of our Savages in their enjoyments, for the augmentation of their Family!

<P>Something of this kind is al&s;o ob&s;erv'd among other Nati|ons: For in&s;tance, the <HI>Canadians</HI> borrow Names from Fi&s;hes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;carbot.</NOTE> and Rivers: The <HI>Virginians</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> take theirs from the fir&s;t thing they think of, as from Bows, Arrows, living Crea|tures, Trees, Plants: The Grand Seignors of <HI>Turkey</HI> are wont to give to the Eunuchs who keep their Wives, the Names of the faire&s;t Flowers; to the end that tho&s;e Women calling them by the &s;ame Names, there &s;hould proceed nothing out of their mouths but what were decent and delightful: The <HI>Romans,</HI> as may be &s;een in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> &s;ometimes took their Names from Fi&s;hes, &s;ometimes from their Country-diverti&s;e|ments, &s;ometimes from the marks and imperfections of their bodies, and &s;ometimes from their mo&s;t Heroick Actions, in imitation of the <HI>Greeks:</HI> Nay the Holy Scriptures furni&s;h us with abundance of examples of Names taken from divers ac|cidents, as among others tho&s;e of <HI>Benoni, Pharez, Icabod,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>The Names which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> impo&s;e on their male chil|dren &s;ome time after their birth, are not to be continu'd while they live; for they change their Names when they come to the age requi&s;ite to be receiv'd into the number of Souldiers: and when they have behav'd them&s;elves valiantly in the Wars, and have kill'd one of the chief Commanders of the <HI>Arou|agues,</HI> they a&s;&s;ume his Name, as a mark of Honour: Which Cu&s;tom relates &s;omewhat to what was practis'd among the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> after their Victories, when they a&s;&s;um'd to them&s;elves the Names of the Nations whom they had &s;ubdu'd; as may be in&s;tanc'd in <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> and divers others whom we need not cite.

<P>At two years of age their hair is cut, and then there is a Fea&s;t made for the whole Family; &s;ome Parents defer till that time the piercing or boring of their ears, lips, and the &s;pace be|tween the no&s;trils; yet is not this much in u&s;e, but only when the weakne&s;s of the child will not permit it to be done &s;ooner. When they are a little more advanc'd in years, the Boys eat with their Fathers, and the Girls with their Mothers: Fathers|in-Law, and all Relations which are in the collateral line with their true Fathers, they call by the general name of Fa|thers.</P>
<P>Though the Children of the <HI>Caribbians</HI> are not in&s;tructed to do any reverence to their Parents, nor to expre&s;s the re&s;pect and honour they owe them, by any ge&s;tures of the body; yet have they a natural affection for them, and if any injury be done them, they immediately e&s;pou&s;e their quarrel, and en|deavour all the ways they can to be revenged: For in&s;tance, a <HI>French-man</HI> of <HI>Gardeloupe</HI> having cut the cords of the <HI>Amac</HI> wherein an old <HI>Caribbian</HI> lay, by which means falling down he brui&s;ed him&s;elf and put his &s;houlder out of joint, the old man's Son-in-Law immedately got together &s;ome young men, who making an incur&s;ion into the I&s;land of <HI>Marigalanta,</HI> ma&s;lacred the <HI>French</HI> who were then beginning to plant them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>But the main bu&s;ine&s;s which the <HI>Caribbians</HI> mind in the edu|cation of their Children, is to teach them the u&s;e of the Bow: And to bring them the better on, a&s;&s;oon as they are able to go the Parents put their Breakfa&s;t on the branch of a tree, whence they mu&s;t &s;trike it down with their Arrows before they eat; if they cannot there is no compa&s;&s;ion: As the Children grow up, their portion of meat is hung up higher: Sometimes al&s;o they cut off a <HI>Banana</HI>-tree, and plant it in the ground as a But, to teach their Children to &s;hoot at the Fruit: by this means
<PB N="341" REF="184">
in proce&s;s of time they come to be expert in that exerci&s;e. An|cient Hi&s;tories tell us of other people, who not differing much from this Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> obliged their Children to &s;ling down their meat from the place where they &s;et it.</P>
<P>They commonly de&s;ign all their Sons to bear Arms, and to revenge them of their Enemies, in imitation of their Prede|ce&s;&s;ors: But before they are ranked among tho&s;e who may go to the wars, they are to be declared Souldiers in the pre|&s;ence of all their kindred and friends, who are invited to be pre&s;ent at &s;o &s;olemn a Ceremony: The manner of it is thus; The Father, who had before got all his Friends together, cau&s;es his Son to &s;it on a low &s;tool, which is placed in the mid&s;t of the Hut, or in the <HI>Carbet;</HI> and after he hath repre&s;ented to him the whole duty of a generous <HI>Caribbian</HI> Soldier, and made him promi&s;e that he will never do any thing which may derogate from the glory of his Predece&s;&s;ors, and that he will to the utmo&s;t of his power revenge the ancient quarrel of his Nation, he takes by the feet a certain Bird of prey, which they call <HI>Mansfennis</HI> in their language, and which had been prepared long before for that purpo&s;e, and with that he di&s;|charges &s;everal blows on his Son, till &s;uch time as the bird is killed, and the head of it cru&s;hed to pieces: After this rough treatment, which puts the young man as it were into a maze, he &s;carifies his whole body with the tooth of an <HI>Agouty,</HI> and to cure the wounds he hath made, he puts the dead bird into an infu&s;ion of <HI>Pyman-&s;eeds,</HI> and he rubs all the wounded parts therewith, which cau&s;es an extraordinary pain to the poor Pa|tient; but it is requi&s;ite he &s;hould &s;uffer all this with a cheer|ful countenance, without the lea&s;t di&s;covery of pain: Then they make him eat the heart of the bird; and to clo&s;e the Ce|remony, he is laid into a kind of <HI>Amac,</HI> where he is to conti|nue &s;tretched out to his full length, till his &s;trength be in a man|ner &s;pent, by rea&s;on of much fa&s;ting: That done, he is acknow|ledged by all to be a Souldier; he is admitted into the A&s;&s;em|blies of the <HI>Carbet,</HI> and may go along with the re&s;t in all their military Expeditions which they undertake again&s;t their Enemies.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the exerci&s;es of war, which are common to all the young <HI>Caribbians</HI> who would live in any e&s;teem among the Bravos of their Nation, their Fathers do many times de&s;ign them to be <HI>Boyez,</HI> that is Magicians, and Physitians: To that end they &s;end them to &s;ome one of the be&s;t skill'd in that dam|nable profe&s;&s;ion, that is, one who hath the reputation of in|vocating the evil Spirits, in&s;tructing people how to be re|venged of their enemies by &s;orceries, and in curing divers di&s;|ea&s;es whereto tho&s;e of that Nation are &s;ubject: But it is re|qui&s;ite that the young man who is pre&s;ented to the <HI>Boyez</HI> to be in&s;tructed in his Art, &s;hould be con&s;ecrated thereto from his

<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> do al&s;o teach their Children to fi&s;h, &s;wim, make Ba&s;kets, Clubs, Bows, Arrows, Girdles, Beds of Cotton and <HI>Pyragas:</HI> But to have any care of cultivating their minds, and in&s;tructing them in any thing of civility, or vertue, is more than could be expected from tho&s;e poor Savages, who have no other light than their own blinded under&s;tanding, nor follow any other rule in all the actions of their lives, than the &s;ad di&s;|order of vicious and corrupt nature.</P>

<P>As concerning the Ceremonies ob&s;erved by them upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, we have already given &s;ome account thereof in the Chapter of their <HI>Religion:</HI> It is requi&s;ite above all things, that the Hou&s;e or Hut into which the <HI>Boy&eacute;</HI> is to enter, &s;hould be very neatly prepared for his reception; that the little Table, which they call <HI>Matoutou,</HI> &s;hould be furni&s;hed with <HI>Anakri</HI> for <HI>Maboya,</HI> that is, an offering of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ava</HI> and <HI>Ouicou,</HI> for the evil Spirit, as al&s;o with the fir&s;t-fruits of their Gardens, if it be the &s;ea&s;on of fruits: It is further requi&s;ite, that at one end of the Hut, there &s;hould be as many low &s;tools or &s;eats as there are to be per&s;ons pre&s;ent at that dete&s;table action.</P>

<P>Certain people of old finding them&s;elves unable to endure<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelian, <HI>l. 3. c.</HI> 38</NOTE> the trouble and inconveniences of decrepit age, were wont to di&s;patch their wearied &s;ouls out of their infirm bodies with a gla&s;s of Hemlock: And &s;ome others, as <HI>Pliny</HI> affirms, being<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. c. 12.</NOTE> weary of their lives, ca&s;t them&s;elves into the Sea: But in other<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ael. <HI>l. 4. c.</HI> 1.</NOTE> Countries the Children thought it too long to &s;tay till their Parents were come to &s;o great age, and &s;o became their Exe|cutioners, and this they were authorized to do by a publick Law.

<P>But how old &s;oever they may be among the <HI>Caribbians,</HI> the Children are never troubled to &s;ee their Fathers and Mothers in that condition: True it is, that &s;ome <HI>Caribbians</HI> heretofore have ha&s;tened the death of their Parents, and have killed their Fathers and Mothers out of a per&s;wa&s;ion that they did a good work, and rendred them a charitable office, by delivering them out of many inconveniences and troubles which attend old age. An old Captain among them, whom the <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Le Pilote,</HI> made it his boa&s;t that he had done that dete&s;table &s;ervice to many of his Ance&s;tors: But it is to be ob&s;erved that the <HI>Carib|bians</HI> did not practi&s;e that inhumanity, but only towards tho&s;e who de&s;ired to be delivered in that manner out of the mi&s;eries of this life; and &s;o it was a certain compliance with their ear|ne&s;t entreaties who were weary of their lives: Moreover that piece of barbari&s;m was never univer&s;ally received among them, and the more prudent &s;ort do at the pre&s;ent dete&s;t it, and main|tain their Fathers and Mothers to the la&s;t ga&s;p, with all the care, and all the expre&s;&s;ions of love, honour, and re&s;pect that can be expected from a Nation which hath no other light for

its direction, than that of a corrupt Nature: They patiently bear with their imperfections, and the frowardne&s;s of their old age, are never weary of mini&s;tring unto them, and as much as they can, keep neer them, to divert them, as the <HI>French</HI> have ob&s;erv'd in &s;ome of their I&s;lands; which demeanour of theirs is the more commendable, in that it is done among&s;t Barbari|ans: So that if any among them do not honour their Fathers and Mothers, they have degenerated from the vertue of their An|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>But when after all their care and pains they chance to lo&s;e any one of their Friends or Relations, they make great cries and lamentations upon his death: Wherein they differ much from the ancient <HI>Thracians,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the <HI>Fortu|nate</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herod. <HI>l. 5. &amp;</HI> Philo&s;t <HI>in the Life of</HI> Apollonius, <HI>l. 5. c.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>I&s;lands,</HI> who buried their dead with rejoicing, dancing, and &s;inging, as per&s;ons delivered out of the mi&s;eries of humane life. After the <HI>Caribbians</HI> have wept over their dead, they wa&s;h them, paint the bodies with a red colour, rub their heads with Oil, comb their hair, thru&s;t up the legs to the thighs, and the elbows between the legs, and bend down the face upon the hands, &s;o that the whole body &s;omewhat re&s;em|bles the po&s;ture of the child in the mothers womb; and then they wrap it up in a new bed, till all things be ready to di&s;po&s;e it into the ground.</P>

<P>They commonly make the grave within the hou&s;e of the

decea&s;ed; or if they bury him el&s;ewhere, they always make a covering over the place where the body is to be laid, and after they have let it down into the grave, and wrap'd it in an <HI>Amac,</HI> they make a great fire about it, and all the more ancient both men and women kneel down: The men place them&s;elves be|hind the women, and ever and anon they &s;troke them with their hands over their arms, to incite them to lament and weep: Then &s;inging and weeping they all &s;ay with a pitiful and la|menting voice: <Q>Alas, why did&s;t thou dye?

Nicholas in Bergeron, Carpin, &amp; Trigaut.</NOTE> of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> the <HI>Canarians,</HI> the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> do al|&s;o bring certain di&s;hes of meat to the graves of their neere&s;t Relations. And not to go to Countries at &s;o great a di&s;tance, is there not &s;omething of this kind done among us? for during certain dayes they &s;erve the Effigies of our Kings and Princes newly dead, and they are pre&s;ented with meat and drink, as if they were living, nay &s;o far as to ta&s;te the meats and drinks before them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribbians</HI> of &s;ome I&s;lands do &s;till &s;et meat at the graves of the decea&s;ed, but they leave them not &s;o long as they did heretofore, ere they covered them with earth: For after the Funeral lamentation is ended, and that the women have wept as much as they can, &s;ome friend of the decea&s;ed laies a plank over his head, and the re&s;t put the earth together with their hands till they have filled the grave; that done, they burn all that belonged to the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>They al&s;o &s;ometimes kill Slaves to attend the Gho&s;ts of the decea&s;ed, and to wait on them in the other world: But the&s;e poor wretches get out of the way when their Ma&s;ters dye, in|to &s;ome other I&s;land. We may ju&s;tly conceive a horrour at the relation of the&s;e inhumane and barbarous Funerals, which are<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aco&s;ta'<HI>s Hi&s;t. of</HI> China, De Laet, Garcil. Pirard, Lin|&s;cot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> drench'd with the blood of Slaves, and divers other per&s;ons, and among others women, who have their throats cut, are burnt and buried alive, to go and accompany their Husbands into the other world, whereof frequent examples may be found in divers Nations: But our <HI>Caribbians</HI> think it enough upon the&s;e occa&s;ions to put to death only the Slaves of the decea&s;ed, if they can catch them.</P>
<P>It was forbidden the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> to bury any thing with the decea&s;ed per&s;on; but the contrary hath been and is &s;till practi&s;ed in divers Nations: For not to mention the many pre|cious<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virgil, Ari|an, Tacitus.</NOTE> things which were con&s;umed with the Bodies that were burnt among the ancient <HI>Romans, Macedonians, Germans</HI> and other people, we read in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that King<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib. 7. c.</HI> 12. Carpin. De Lery, Dutch <HI>Rela|tions,</HI> De La|ct, &amp; Junius.</NOTE> <HI>Solomon</HI> put up great wealth with the body of <HI>David</HI> his Fa|ther: Thus the <HI>Tartars</HI> put into the grave with the dead per|&s;on all his Gold and Silver: And the <HI>Bra&s;ilians, Virginians, Ca|nadians</HI> and &s;everal other Savages inter with the bodies, the cloths and whatever el&s;e belonged to the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="189">The &s;ame thing was al&s;o practi&s;ed among the <HI>Caribbians</HI> in their Funerals, before they conver&s;ed with the <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> For at the la&s;t vi&s;it they made to the decea&s;ed, they brought along with them all the things he had u&s;ed or worn about him in his life time, to wit, his Bow and arrows, the <HI>Boutou,</HI> or Club, the Crowns of Feathers, Pendants, Chains, Rings, Bracelets, Ba&s;|kets, Ve&s;&s;els, and other things, and buried all with him, or burnt them over the grave: But now they are grown better Husbands; for the Relations of the decea&s;ed re&s;erve all tho&s;e things for their own u&s;e, or el&s;e they be&s;tow them as pre&s;ents on tho&s;e who come to the Interment, who keep them in re|membrance of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>After the body is covered with earth, the neare&s;t Relations cut off their hair, and fa&s;t very rigorou&s;ly, out of a per&s;wa&s;ion that by that means they &s;hall live longer and more happily: Others for&s;ake the hou&s;es and the place where they have bu|ried any of their kinred, and go and live el&s;ewhere: When the body is neer rotted, they make another a&s;&s;embly, and after they have vi&s;ited, and &s;ighing trampled on the Sepulchre, they have a merry meeting, at which they drown all their grief in <HI>Ouicou.</HI> Thus the Ceremony is concluded, and the poor Car|ca&s;s is no further tormented.</P>
