<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. 1.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Birth, Parentage and Education of the Knight of Fond Love.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Reign of <HI>Oliver,</HI> Protector of <HI>England,</HI> there dwelt in the famous City of <HI>London,</HI> the chief Me|tropolis thereof, a Gentleman, who being well skilled in the Art of Phy&s;ick, fir&s;t got Practice, then a Wife, and then Children.</P>
<P>His name was <HI>Cri&s;pe:</HI> &s;ome &s;ay, Of the ancient Family of <HI>Cri&s;pus Salu&s;tius;</HI> though Antiquity hath quite worn away <HI>Salu&s;t,</HI> and left one <HI>Cri&s;pe</HI> behinde.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of his I&s;&s;ue, he had thr&eacute;e &s;ons; the elder chri&s;tened <HI>Toby,</HI> the younger ycleped <HI>Samuel,</HI> and the young|e&s;t &s;irnamed <HI>Rowland.</HI></P>
<P>It is reported, that the Mother, while &s;he was with child of the&s;e two &s;triplings, dreamt that &s;he brought forth two lumps of Chalk, and a pound of Pomecitron: upon which &s;he went to an A&s;trologer, who did thereupon portend the &s;w&eacute;etne&s;s of the young mens di&s;po&s;itions, and that they &s;hould be long'd after, by young Virgins.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, as they grew up, grew &s;traight and proper; and for their Faces, they &s;&eacute;em'd, if they pleas'd, made to &s;ave charges; for they were &s;o good, they n&eacute;eded no Bands. Their
<PB REF="4"> Father was not forgetful in their younger years to in&s;til in|to them &s;he whole&s;ome Precepts contained in the P&s;alter, Primer and Hornbook, as well for in&s;truction, as to make them capable of reading their Mother Language. But as they grew in years, higher De&s;ignes crept into their pates; and they re&s;olved to enrich them&s;elves with &s;uch accompli&s;h|ments as &s;hould make them eminent. Prudently therefore con&s;idering at what mark to aim, in the fir&s;t place, they re|ject Natural Philo&s;ophy, as too &s;erious; they &s;purn away the Mathematicks, as too hard a Science for their tender capa|cities; they kick away Law, calling the Terme thereof, Conjuring. Being thus in a d&eacute;ep Debate, quoth <HI>Toby</HI> to <HI>Samuel:</HI></P>
<P>As I am elder then you, &s;o I may perhaps &s;peak as wi&s;ely as you: 'Tis true, I am a Merchant, yet I have idle time e|nough to &s;pare, and can follow any other hand&s;ome imploy|ment, to wa&s;te lei&s;ure-hours: Some men follow drinking; but I cannot maintain quarrels, and therefore I like it not. Some follow gaming; but there's mi&s;chief and danger in that, too, e&s;pecially if a man que&s;tion the Dice; &s;o that I abjure it. Therefore I am of opinion, that there is no Art &s;o &s;uitable to our Di&s;po&s;itions, as the Art of Love; 'Tis a fine Calling, and a civil: for, Ladies, Brothers, will not only not fight, but love; and doubtle&s;s love us, being proper and hand&s;ome: Be&s;ides, Brother, as I take it, there is a Duty lying upon young men, to &s;erve and wait upon young Ladies and Gentlewomen.</P>
<P><HI>Toby</HI> having ended this Sp&eacute;ech, <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;houted for joy, &s;aying to his Brother, that he was wi&s;er then <HI>Solomon,</HI> and had more di&s;cretion then his <HI>Name&s;ake,</HI> who was Iudge of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> But Brother, two heads are better then one; and therefore, as you have begun the invention, you &s;hall &s;&eacute;e how bravely I will contride the re&s;t: For you mu&s;t know, Bro|ther, that before we can practi&s;e this Art, to wait upon La|dies, as we &s;hould do, we mu&s;t be knighted, and a&s;&s;ume unto our &s;elves certain Titles, after we have &s;tudied tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t requi&s;ite to accompli&s;h us. Thus was St. <HI>George</HI> knighted before he could conquer the Dragon, for the
<PB REF="4"> Kings Daughters &s;ake, and was called, <HI>The Knight of the Red Cro&s;s.</HI> So likewi&s;e, the Grocers Apprentice, before he could be fit to wait on his Mi&s;tru&s;&s;es daughter, was knigh|ted, and called, <HI>The Knight of the Burning Pe&s;tle.</HI> Fir&s;t, therefore, let us learn to dance, then let us read the &s;everal Books and Treati&s;es that may better our complemental Language, and then I &s;hall not que&s;tion but to find out &s;ome per&s;on or other, who may give us our Order.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the&s;e two young men proceeded in their Studies, and how they were dubb'd by Sir <HI>Pemmel,</HI> Knight of the <HI>Eleemo&s;ynary Ale.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WIth this intention they went to Sir <HI>Channel,</HI> Knight of the <HI>Kitt and Fiddle,</HI> who being a man of great expe|rience, and more knowing in his Art, then the &s;even wi&s;e Men of Greece, and withal, m&eacute;eting with prompt wits and nimble h&eacute;els, obtained great Renown, and cau&s;ed their Re|putation to dilate it &s;elf, both far and near. Onely one thing griev'd him, that whereas he thought to have made them Ma&s;ters of the Harmonious Ca&s;tanets, their capaci|ties could never reach to do any thing worth hearing, upon tho&s;e In&s;truments. However, they were not unmindeful to buy up the choice&s;t Books of Complements, yet not with &s;uch a prodigality, as to give the <HI>Book&s;eller</HI> what ever he ask'd, but warily beating him down to the lowe&s;t price well knowing, that tho&s;e who were too lavi&s;h in their youth, might come to want in their old age, according to the Doctrine of <HI>John De Moon.</HI> The next men con&s;ulted withel, were Millen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, touching the variety and priority of colours; and the in&s;tructions which they received from them, were wrote down in Table-Books, and con'd every morning before they &s;aid their Prayers: becau&s;e their choice&s;t <HI>Memorandums</HI> were alwayes laid up next their hearts. The next thing
<PB REF="5"> they did, was the choice of an able and knowing Taylors a man of good intelligence, as to the Fa&s;hion, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they could never be truly accompli&s;h'd; one good &s;uit of Cloaths doing a man more credit, then all the Gr&eacute;ek and Latine that ever was &s;poke &s;ince the de&s;truction of <HI>Troy.</HI> But Lord, to &s;&eacute;e how coy Fortune is to &s;ome, how fr&eacute;e to others! The&s;e Per&s;ons could no &s;ooner wi&s;h but have: For going to <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> one of the&s;e young per&s;ons happened to be adry; and &s;eeking for an Ale-hou&s;e, they lighted in at the &s;ign of the <HI>Buff-coat:</HI> they called for Ale; 'twas asked whether <HI>Eleemo&s;ynary,</HI> or other Ale? they replyed, What Ale's that? quoth the Squire, This is the Ca&s;tle of Sir <HI>Pemmel,</HI> Knight of the <HI>Eleemo&s;ynary</HI> Ale, as being that Liquor with which mo&s;t commonly, he relieves di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Knights: where|upon they &s;ent for the Knight, who coming courteou&s;ly unto them, they demanded &s;everal Que&s;tions; and among the re&s;t, whether he had power to make Knights. Sir <HI>Pemmel</HI> re|plyed, That he had; and that, if they pleas'd, he could erect new Orders: at which they received great &s;atisfaction, de|&s;tring to be made Knights al&s;o: and having heard a Cata|logue of Orders read to them, they at length pitched upon the <HI>Order of Fond Love:</HI> which being determined, the Laws were produced and read.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That they &s;hould never &s;peak &s;ence to any Lady they went to vi&s;it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they &s;hould give their Ladies often Treatments, and not minde what they &s;pend upon them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they go every day to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> to &s;ee the ex|act Modes of Whisks, and Trimmings of Gloves, and give their Ladies information accordingly.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That their Handkerchiefs be alwayes perfum'd with Orange flower-water.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That they love every Lady they &s;ee; and that they have not &s;o bad an opinion of the &s;aid Ladies, as to believe they do not love them again.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Tho&s;e Laws being read, their Cars were &s;top'd with
<PB REF="5"> black Wool, le&s;t any thing contrary to the&s;e Orders &s;hould enter into them; which being done, they were bid to kn&eacute;el, when lo, in came Sir <HI>Pemmel,</HI> and laying the Fire-Fork on their &s;houlders, bid them, <HI>Ri&s;e up Sir Toby, and Sir Samuel Crip&s;e, Knights of the Order of Fond Love.</HI> After this, they thank'd Sir <HI>Pemmel</HI> for his civility, and gave the Squire the odde peny which was over and above the reckon|ing, and &s;o departed. Then re&s;olving to have but one Squire betw&eacute;en them, to &s;ave charges, they went and hired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, who readily agr&eacute;e'd to &s;erve them for five &s;hillings a quarter, and their old &s;ilk Stockings.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIr <HI>Samuel</HI> being got home, his heart fell a throbbing and beating; as if the <HI>Cyclops</HI> had b&eacute;en making Thunder|bolts there. He fetch'd &s;ighs from the bottom of his Bre&s;t, and farts from the bottom of his Belly: If he eat, it was becau&s;e he was an hungry; and if he drank, it was to drown &s;orrow. At length, impatient of delay, he uttered his woes in this &s;ort: Oh mo&s;t unfortunate of men, and mo&s;t wretch|ed of young men! unhappy eyes! why were ye not a&s;l&eacute;ep, asl&eacute;ep to &s;l&eacute;ep, your De&s;truction? To what purpo&s;e am I black and comely, &s;traight and proper, but that women &s;hould be in love with me? and mu&s;t I be now in love with woman? but I am in love, &amp; cannot help it for my heart and guts. O <HI>Elizabetha, Elizabetha Tottel,</HI> thou ha&s;t undone <HI>Sa|muel Cri&s;pe.</HI> By this time his good Squire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> came in, and told him where his <HI>Elizabetha</HI> lay: whereupon, calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, he thus wrote unto her.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THus re&s;olved, Sir <HI>Samuel,</HI> powder'd by his Barber, trim'd by his Taylor, and Ribanded with &s;uch Empha|tical Colours, that had he &s;aid nothing, his Mi&s;tre&s;s might have gather'd his meaning from his Codpiece, he &s;ets on his journey. But Oh the fate of mortal wights! what a &s;ad di&s;a&s;ter befel him! For as he was going in the &s;tr&eacute;et, one of the <HI>Knights of the Cole-wharf</HI> m&eacute;ets him, with his Chariot laden: and as he came to the hor&s;e-head, the hor&s;e &s;tumbling, all be&s;patter'd his Boot-ho&s;e.

<P>He would have demanded &s;atisfaction of the <HI>Knight of the Cole-wharf;</HI> but the Knight lifting up his Whip, he thought it better, &s;ince his Mi&s;tre&s;s was not by to take no|tice of the affront, nor there to in&s;pire him with Valour, to go and &s;hift him&s;elf, then to anger that man of choler, who went about to puni&s;h Knights, as other men puni&s;h dogs.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI>Samuel</HI> courted <HI>Elizabetha,</HI> and how the Chamber-maid affronted him; and what happened thereupon.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIr <HI>Samuel</HI> being now in the pre&s;ence of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, though at fir&s;t he were a little daunted at the Maje&s;tie of her per&s;on, yet finding that he mu&s;t either &s;peak, or be counted a Puppy, for coming to vi&s;it a Lady, and &s;aying no|thing; he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, after a leg or two made in mood and figure, in the&s;e following words.</P>
<P><HI>Madam, &s;eeing the painted cloth of your vertues hang out at the window, and Fame &s;tanding at the door with a Trumpet in her hand, I could not chu&s;e, out of a natural inclination which I have to &s;ights and Puppet-plays, but &s;tep in and behold the mon&s;trou&s;ne&s;s of your beauties: and now Madam I have &s;een you, I admire you more then the hairy Gentlewoman.</HI> Donna <HI>Elizabetha</HI> reply'd, That truly his per&s;on was very proper, and his language was ve|ry eloquent: but withal &s;he told him, that &s;he was very &s;or|ry that he had put him&s;elf to &s;o great a trouble, &s;ince &s;he found by him (for &s;he could &s;&eacute;e as far into a Mil&s;tone as an|other) that he was not for her turn. But he confidently, as being now over &s;hooes over boots, returns her an&s;wer, That &s;he had created love within him, and that he hoped &s;he would not cau&s;e it to be born and die at the &s;ame in&s;tant: and therefore he petitions her again, in the&s;e words: <HI>Mo&s;t cele&s;tial beam of beauty, I have received you into my heart, which like a Burning-gla&s;s contracting the heat of your rays, is now all on fire, not to be quenched but by the moi&s;tning Julep of your affection; and therefore do not deny me life, &s;ince it is altogether in your power to give it.</HI> To which &s;he fe&s;tingly replies, that &s;he was &s;orry &s;he could not
<PB REF="7"> &s;ub&s;cribe his petition: yet &s;he was glad to &s;&eacute;e him, for that &s;he never &s;aw a Phenix before; which &s;he conjectured him to be, becau&s;e he went about to die in his flames. However, if that were not his intention, rather then he &s;hould be &s;corched to death for love of her, that could not requite him, &s;he would cau&s;e her Maid to make water in a ba&s;on, that he might bathe and quench his burning bre&s;t therein. Sir <HI>Samuel</HI> thanked her, telling her withal, that any &s;tream of her kindne&s;s would be acceptably received into his bo&s;ome. <HI>But wo is me,</HI> (&s;aid he, proc&eacute;eding) <HI>for I finde my words have made no more impre&s;&s;ion in your heart, then an ar|row on a rock of Adamant: &s;o that I may &s;ay of you, that as in the greene&s;t gra&s;s is the greate&s;t &s;erpent, in the cleare&s;t water the uglie&s;t toad; &s;o is your fair body lin'd with a cruel &s;oul. Alas, you have no mercy on my Captivity; &s;o that I am like the &s;paniel, that gnaws his chain, but &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ver &s;poils his teeth then procures liberty. But as a bladder is to a learning &s;wimmer, &s;o is Hope to me; which makes me apt to believe, that as there is no iron but will be &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ned with the fire; &s;o there is no heart, how hard &s;oever, that will not be &s;oftned by continual prayers. Con&s;ider, that the &s;un di&s;dains not to &s;hine upon the &s;malle&s;t worm.

<P>Being thus yen&s;ively left alone, the Chamber-maid comes down, and &s;eeing Sir <HI>Samuel</HI> in &s;uch a &s;ad condition, &s;he ac|co&s;ts him, telling him, that though he had not the way, yet &s;he knew how well enough to prevail with her Mi&s;tri&s;s; a&s;&s;uring him withal, that for five pieces &s;he would make him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;our of the happine&s;s he &s;ought to enjoy. Sir <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;hak'd his head at this, telling her, That it was for ought he knew, more then he &s;hould receive for her portion; but it five &s;hillings would content her, it was at her &s;ervice. At which words, the Maid di&s;covering the pitiful humour of Sir
<PB REF="8"> <HI>Samuel,</HI> di&s;daining his profer, called him Sad Fellow, and Mole-catcher, telling him he did not de&s;erve a Kitchin|wench: and as he went out of doors, &s;he pinned a &s;heet of brown Paper to the Cape of his Cloak; which though it were not written, yet gave many people as he went in the &s;treets, an opportunity &s;ufficient to read the Character of the man.</P>

<P>How <HI>Sir Samuel</HI> fell in love with another Lady, and how he &s;ought to win her affections.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Samuel</HI> now finding <HI>Elizabetha</HI> &s;o &s;tubborn and re|fractory to his de&s;tres, he was re&s;olved to have two &s;trings to his bow. Now &s;o it &s;ell out, that walking one day to|ward the clo&s;e of the evening, he e&s;pyed &s;tanding at her door, a Lady pa&s;&s;ing fair and beautiful. He had already ex|perience that the Ladies were not taken with the propor|ne&s;s of his per&s;on, or the comline&s;s of his face. Pondering therefore upon many ways and means to attain his ends, he began to think of the great power of money. It may be, quoth he to him&s;elf, this Lady may want &s;ome Geugaws, as Gloves, Pins and Ribans; now if I &s;hould furni&s;h her han&s;omely with a &s;mall &s;um, certainly I &s;hall eternally o|blige her heart and affections to me. In this Contempla|tion, he walks to and fro three or four times by her: at
<PB REF="9"> length, thinking it not convenient to profer money to a Lady whom he never &s;aw before in his life, he re&s;olved to put his coyn into a bag, and drop it as it were by accident before her. This he did in imitation of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> thinking to have enjoyed this Lady in a &s;howre of Silver, as <HI>Jove</HI> enjoyed <HI>Diana</HI> in a &s;howre of Gold. But &s;uch was the mi&s;|fortune of this infortunate Knight, that the Lady frighted at the fall of the bag, fearing &s;ome Trapan, ran in adoors; leaving it to be taken up by the next Pa&s;&s;enger, who &s;cru|pled not to pocket up the price of Sir <HI>Samuels</HI> Love; with a re&s;olution doubtle&s;s not to put it to any &s;uch frivolens u&s;e again. All this while Sir <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;tood hugging his in|vention not far off; and at length &s;eeing the Cat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;trophe, with a patience like that of <HI>Job,</HI> beheld the lo&s;s voth of his Mi&s;tri&s;s and his money, without taking any further notice thereof.</P>

<P>'TWas now the time of the year when there is a great re|&s;ort of people of both &s;exes at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> a &s;mall village in <HI>Kent,</HI> famous for the purging Springs that are there found.

He is one of a &s;ingle humility, and that to a Mi&s;trifs, for whom he had rather be metamorpho&s;ed to a Puppy-Dog, then di&s;plea&s;e her. He wears goods Cloathes, and tho&s;e various and fa&s;hionable: yet he holds it great Prudence &s;ometimes to borrow a Country Clowns leather Breeches to court his Mop&s;a in. His greate&s;t mi&s;ery is, that only Cavalier Ladies affect him, and that his Cockney humour bears as much malice to people of &s;o good a quality, as the Devil does Ami|ty to Roundheads, and the Good Old Cau&s;e. He is never valorous but in womans Company; and if confidently a&s;&s;aulted by them (as in <HI>Tunbridge</HI> wood) yeilds immediately the trea&s;ure of his Pockets to them, for to buy Candles to &s;it by and laugh at him for a Coward. He is very unfortunate in his elder Brother being held hand&s;omer then him&s;elf; often|times having fallen mo&s;t de&s;perately in love with tho&s;e Mop&s;a's and Mi&s;oes that were ready to &s;tran|gle them&s;elves for &s;weet <HI>Toby.</HI> In fine, he is his own and ridiculous <HI>Don Quixots</HI> Heir, the Ladies Whelp, every Mans Fool, the Book&s;ellers Outlary, and the Earths Burden.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI>Samuel</HI> may go hang him&s;elf, if he plea&s;es.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THus, gentle Reader, do I put period to the Misfortunes of our unfortunate Knight: I have given thee a large accompt of his Life; it is truly &s;ummed up unto th&eacute;e. Now being thus abu&s;ed in the Country, laughed at in the City, de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;corned both in City and Country; unpitied by Ladies, uncompa&s;sionated by Men; what remains for him to do? Nothing that I know of, but onely to take a Rope, yea, a new Rope, even a new two-peny Rope, and hang him|&s;elf; &s;o &s;hall he die revenging him&s;elf upon his Enemies, by depriding them of the Subject of their mirth and laughter.</P>
