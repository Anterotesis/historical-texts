<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI></P>
<P>I Have now neither time to write the particulars of the Hi&s;tory of that Flou|ri&s;hing I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> nor conveniency to in&s;ert it into this Book of the Laws of that Country, becau&s;e I &s;hould thereby make it to &s;well be|yond the intended convenien|cy of a Pocket-Book. But for the better &s;atisfaction of any that may be inclin'd to remove them&s;elves to that I&s;land, I have been de&s;ired to write
<PB REF="3">this &s;hort (but true) account of that Country; which plea&s;e to take as followeth.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> fell fir&s;t into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the 10th. day of <HI>May,</HI> in the year 1655. The Middle of it is &s;ituated neare&s;t in 17 degrees 40 minutes of North Latitude, &s;o that their longe&s;t day from Sun Ri&s;ing to Sun Setting is 13 hours 4 minutes, and their &s;horte&s;t 10 hours 56 minutes, The difference of Longitude, from the Meridian of <HI>London,</HI> to the Meridian which pa&s;&s;es over <HI>Port-Royal</HI> (the chiefe&s;t Town there,) is 78 degrees 45 minutes We&s;t|ward, which cau&s;es 5 hours 15 minutes difference in time, &s;o that when it is Noon-day
<PB REF="3">there, it is a quarter of an hour pa&s;t 5 in the Afternoon in <HI>Lon|don.</HI> The length of the I&s;land lies neare&s;t Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and is accounted to be 180 Miles, and the bredth in the broade&s;t part of it 45 Miles, &s;o that its Figure is neare&s;t an Oval. It lies under that which is called the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> ne|verthele&s;s the Air is moderate|ly temperate, occa&s;ion'd by the long ab&s;ence of the Sun every night, by the &s;trong Ea&s;terly <HI>Breezes</HI> which generally blow from 8 or 9 in the Morning to 4 or 5 in the Afternoon, and by the Land Wind, which is a &s;mall cool <HI>Breeze</HI> that comes off the Shoar from all parts of the I&s;land in the Evening, and blows gently all
<PB REF="4">Night. The Nights are for the mo&s;t part fair, and not a Cloud to be &s;een in the Sky, &s;o that by their clearne&s;s and coolne&s;s they are exceedingly plea&s;ant; The Day time is much more hot and trouble|&s;ome, by rea&s;on of the Sun, and the Sea Wind, which mo&s;t days blows very hard; If the weather be &s;uch as is ac|counted &s;ea&s;onable, it com|monly rains a &s;hower in the inland parts under the Moun|tains more or le&s;s every Day, about 1 or 2 a Clock, from the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> with Thunder and Lightning, and this makes the I&s;land fertile, e&s;pecially if accompanied with tho&s;e they call the general &s;ea|&s;ons,
<PB REF="4">which are commonly great rains in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> that continue Night and day with &s;mall intermi&s;&s;ion for 8 or 10 Days together, but the&s;e failing (as &s;ometimes they do) is prejudicial to all things in the Country; the re&s;t of the Year is for the mo&s;t part very fair and delicate weather, with|out much rain. Thunder, or Lightning, and not at all too hot. There are Earthquakes &s;ometimes, two or three per|haps in a Year, but &s;o moderate that they are over before one can well be &s;en&s;ible what they are, and never have yet been &s;o violent to do any harm, The Middle parts of the I&s;land are very full of Mountains, which towards the Ea&s;tward
<PB REF="5">end of it, are &s;o high that they are not habitable, &s;carce acce&s;&s;ible, The&s;e Mountains for the mo&s;t part are covered with large Timber-trees of di|vers &s;orts of Wood fitting for building and &s;everal u&s;es, as well as for bearing many &s;orts of Fruits, which maintain great plenty of Pigeons, Doves, Parots, and other &s;orts of Birds, and al&s;o of wild Hoggs, all very good for food, betwixt the&s;e Mountains there run many Rivers, &s;everal whereof by the acqui&s;ition of divers of the &s;maller Rivulets become large, but few Navigable, by rea&s;on they are for the mo&s;t part barr'd at their falling into the Sea, and many of them &s;inking into the ground (when
<PB REF="5">they come into the Low|lands) before they can reach thither; the&s;e Rivers are well &s;tored with good Fi&s;h, Mul|lets, Creafi&s;h, and Eeles, &s;uch as are in <HI>England,</HI> the re&s;t &s;trangers to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cli|mate, though all very &s;itting to be eaten. The Sea about this I&s;land is al&s;o plentifully &s;tored with many &s;orts of ve|ry good Fi&s;h, and likewi&s;e with Tortoi&s;e, and Manates, both plea&s;ant and delicious Food. The Low-lands and Plain grounds, are where the People generally Inhabit, and in the&s;e are Level tracts of &s;everal Miles in length and bredth, like our Meadows, (full of Gra&s;s) called <HI>Savan|nas</HI> (which Name they retain
<PB REF="6">from the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) in the&s;e are bred great plenty of Cattle, Sheep, Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es and Mules, &s;ufficient both for food and &s;ervice, there is al&s;o in the Country great &s;tocks of Hogs, Hens, Ducks, Pigeons, Rab|bets, Turkeys, and divers kinds of wild Fowl, and al&s;o &s;uffi|cient &s;tores of all &s;orts of Gar|den Herbs and Roots, Pul&s;e and Sallads, and with excel|lent Fruits, &s;ome known here, as Grapes of divers &s;orts, and from &s;everal Countries, Le|mons, Oranges, Citrons, Pom|granats, and Musk Mellons, be&s;ides other very good Fruits, proper to that Country, as the Celebrated Pine, &amp; many more not much inferiour to that incomparable Fruit, and that
<PB REF="6">which makes the&s;e Fruits of the more u&s;e and beauty, and the Country thereby the more plea&s;ant, is, that they (as well as the leaves on all the Trees) continue all the Year, there being no Winter, or decay, but a continual Spring, on every &s;ea&s;onable &s;hower of rain, &s;o that there is nothing wanting, for a nece&s;&s;ary, plen|tiful, or delicate living; In this I&s;land are many conveni|ent Harbours for Shipping, be&s;ides &s;everal Bays and Roads fitting for the landing or take|ing off of Goods: The chief|e&s;t of the&s;e is <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> which in its &s;afety for Ship|ping, depth of Water clean|ne&s;s of Ground, and conve|niency of the Shore and
<PB REF="7">Wharfs, for lading and un|lading of Shipping, may compare with any in the known World, and to add the more to the &s;ecurity of this, and the other Harbours of this I&s;land, tho&s;e dreadful Hur|ricans, which often afflict the I&s;lands of <HI>Barbados, Nevis,</HI> &amp;c. never yet came near this Country. Adjoyning to this Harbour, on an <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of Land, is a hand&s;ome Town of the &s;ame Name, built from the Foundation by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> the ground it &s;tands on is but 53 Acres, and cannot be inlarged in its buildings o|therwi&s;e then what the Inha|bitants gain by the height of their Hou&s;es, for it's incom|pa&s;&s;ed all round with the Har|bour
<PB REF="7">and Sea, unle&s;s on the Ea&s;t part, and there the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> being narrow, is cut off from the Sea to the Harbour, with a &s;trong and well fortified Wall, built with Brick and Stone, and &s;ufficiently Gunn'd, to &s;ecure the Town from any attempt from the Land part, without which Wall none are &s;uffered to build, that &s;o there may be no &s;helter for an Ene|my; This Town for its bigne&s;s is very Populous, and contains about a 1000 Hou&s;es, many of which are built with Bricks, and beautified with Balconies, after the modern way of build|ing in <HI>London;</HI> the Streets are al&s;o regular, and kept very clean; there is al&s;o in it a fair Church built with Brick
<PB REF="8">and Stone, and hand&s;omely fini&s;hed within, and for the defence of the Town and Har|bour, there are 5 Forts &s;trong|ly built with Stone, on which are mounted about 110 large Guns, all kept in good order; hither re&s;ort mo&s;t of the Ships, here is the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, here live the Merchants, and here is mannaged the chiefe&s;t part of the Trade of the I&s;land; To this Harbour belongs a|bout 100 fine &s;ailing Sloops, from about 12 Tuns to 40 Tuns in bigne&s;s, mo&s;t of them built in the Country, which find very good imployment in trading and carrying goods about the I&s;land, and to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> catching of Tor|toi&s;e, and other ways, by which
<PB REF="8">their owners live very well. About 7 Leagues to the We&s;t|ward of this is an old Harbour, a very large, good and &s;afe Harbour for Shipping, and here al&s;o is a &s;mall Town built, which daily encrea&s;es, as the inland parts of the Country a|bout it, are more and more &s;etled and planted; More We&s;terly is <HI>Carli&s;le Bay,</HI> a &s;afe Road for Shipping, and there is likewi&s;e built a pretty Town of that name, of about 100 Hou&s;es, which has a fine Trade, that al&s;o increa&s;es, as the Coun|try does in Plantations; farther We&s;t is <HI>Bluefields Bay,</HI> and o|ther good Roads, and the like there is al&s;o in St. <HI>James</HI>'s, St. <HI>Anns,</HI> and St. <HI>Maries,</HI> on the North &s;ide of the I&s;land, and
<PB REF="9">in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Georges</HI> in the North-Ea&s;t parts, is <HI>Port Antonio,</HI> a &s;afe and good Harbour, and &s;uch ano|ther in the South-Ea&s;t part, called <HI>Port Morant,</HI> be&s;ides divers good Bays more on the South &s;ide, as <HI>Morant Yallahs,</HI> &amp;c. So that there want not conveniencies for the Import|ing or Exporting of their Com|modities, in any part of the Country. There are no Poy|&s;onous or hurtful Creatures known to be in this I&s;land, nor any voracious but the <HI>Cro|codil,</HI> of which though there are many in the Sea, and the Rivers, yet it is rare to hear of any injury done by them. There is but one Town in the inland parts of the Country,
<PB REF="9">and that is called St. <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> it is &s;eated near the banks of a fine River on the one &s;ide, and on the other is A large Plain, or <HI>Savanna</HI> of &s;everal Miles extent, it is a|bout 6 Miles from the Sea of <HI>Port Royal</HI> Harbour, and was built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> many years &s;ince, and in their time was a large Town, and well built after their manner, but on the fir&s;t Peopling of the I&s;land by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> (when they were only an Army) ma|ny of the Hou&s;es were de|&s;troy'd by the Souldiers, and have not &s;ince been rebuilt, becau&s;e the trade of the Coun|try con&s;i&s;ting wholly of Plan|ters and Merchandizing, the one &s;ort whereof living &s;catte|red
<PB REF="10">about the Country as Farmers do in <HI>England,</HI> and the other dwelling in the Sea|port Towns, there is no occa&s;i|on in the Inland parts for &s;uch a Community of Men to dwell together, as that Town would have receiv'd had it continued in its former greatne&s;s, yet here are &s;till many Streets, and fair Hou&s;es, here is al&s;o the &s;eat of the Government; The Go|vernours Hou&s;e and Chief Courts of Ju&s;tice, here the A&s;|&s;embly met, and here are kept all the Records of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t Commodity that this I&s;land makes, is a &s;ort of Mu&s;covadoe Sugar, that ex|cells any that is made in any other of his Maje&s;ties Plantati|ons, the quantity of which
<PB REF="10">increa&s;es &s;o much every Year, that it gives Addition to the number of Ships Trading thither; be&s;ides this Sugar, there are great quantities of In|dico, Cotton, Ginger, Tobac|co, Piemento, Cacaes, Hydes, Achiots, Tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, and divers &s;ort of dying, and o|ther woods, for fine Joyners work, and Cabinets growing there, all which Commodities are as good in their kinds, as are in any Country, and ex|cepting the Sugar, Indico, Cotten, Ginger and Tobacco, are peculiar to this, and are in no other of His Maje&s;ties Plantations; there are al&s;o many other accidental Com|modities brought in from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as Log-wood, Plate,
<PB REF="11">Pieces of Eight, Gold, Pearl, E|meraulds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by means of which Manufactory and Trade, there is not le&s;s then 20 Sail of Ships of 300 Tuns a piece Bur|then, and upwards, be&s;ides o|thers, which only u&s;e that Voy|age, and of all &s;orts above 100 &s;ail of Ships now laden every Year, and as the I&s;land fills with <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and is &s;upplyed with <HI>Negroes,</HI> the Trade and Shipping will both encrea&s;e; This I&s;land depends wholly on His Maje&s;ty, without any other Proprietors or Compa|nies, and ever &s;ince His Ma|je&s;ties happy Re&s;toration, he has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed it &s;hould be Govern'd by a Go|vernour fully Impowered by His Maje&s;ties Commi&s;&s;ion,
<PB REF="11">who has a Council con&s;i&s;ting of 13 of the grave&s;t and chief|e&s;t Gentlemen of the I&s;land, to advi&s;e with on all occa&s;ions, and to them, when it is re|qui&s;ite, there is called an A&s;&s;em|bly of Two and thirty of the Gentlemen of the Country, cho&s;en by the Free-holders from among them&s;elves, by vertue of His Maje&s;ties writ, which to that end is I&s;&s;u'd out by the Governour, into the &s;e|veral Precincts of the Country; The&s;e together with the Go|vernor, and Council make &s;uch Laws as are nece&s;&s;ary for the well Governing of the I|&s;land, and to the making of any Law, there mu&s;t be the con&s;ent of the Governour, Council, and A&s;&s;embly, as
<PB REF="12">three di&s;tinct States, of which if any one di&s;&s;ent, no Bill can pa&s;s into an Act, &s;o that the making of Laws there, is A&s;|&s;imilated as near as may be, to that of our Native Coun|try of <HI>England,</HI> and the&s;e Laws &s;o made, are of Force at all times, until His Maje&s;ty be plea&s;ed to declare his plea&s;ure to the contrary, And for the Incouragement of any of His Maje&s;ties Subjects to go thi|ther, with intent to &s;ettle and Plant, His Maje&s;ty is graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed, to give every Man for him&s;elf, Wife, Chil|dren, and Servants, and all he brings with him (or &s;hall at any time after import) 30 Acres of Land for every head, in any part of the I&s;land, that

<PB REF="13">nece&s;&s;ary Officers, which are appointed in the &s;everal parts of the Country, as there is occa&s;ion, that Ju&s;tice may be equally di&s;tributed; And for the Military Government, and defence of the I&s;land, every Man from 16 years old to 60, is obliged (in 6 weeks after arrival with intent to &s;ettle there) to li&s;t him&s;elf in what Company of Foot, or Troop of Hor&s;e, he plea&s;es, but ha|ing li&s;ted him&s;elf, he is not to remove at his plea&s;ure, except he goes to dwell in &s;ome other part of the Country, and then he mu&s;t li&s;t him&s;elf in that Regiment, where he goes to re&s;ide; Of this Militia (it be|ing no otherwi&s;e) the Gover|nour is Captain General, who
<PB REF="13">is impower'd by his Commi&s;|&s;ion, to make under him Co|lonels, Captains, and all other Officers, which Train and Di&s;|cipline their re&s;pective Soul|diers, and take care that they keep good Arms, well fixt, and &s;ufficient &s;tores of Ammu|nition always by them, that &s;o they may be ready on any oc|ca&s;ion. The Town of <HI>Port Royal</HI> has in it one intire Regiment of this Militia, con&s;i&s;ting of 10 Companies, one of which Companies mounts the Guard &s;ucce&s;&s;ively every night, and keeps Watch in the &s;everal Forts, in as good order as is u&s;ed in any regular Garri&s;on, that is in pay. For the tryal of Titles of Land, deci&s;ion of controver&s;ies, and recovery
<PB REF="14">of debts, there are &s;everal Courts e&s;tabli&s;hed, the me|thods whereof will here fol|low, written by an ingenious Gentleman, who has been a long Practitioner in the Courts and Laws of that Country, as well as in the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty having been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed (with the advice of the Lords of the Privy Council appointed a Committee for Trade and Plan|tations) to give His Royal A&s;|&s;ent to &s;everal Acts made by the Governour, Council and A&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> it was thought fit to Publi&s;h the &s;ame, as well for the benefit of its Inhabitants, as all others His Maje&s;ties Sub|jects who may Trade or be any ways concern'd there; but for prevention of Mi&s;takes (le&s;t
<PB REF="15">&s;trangers to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> might think the&s;e few Acts were all the Laws and Privileges of that I&s;land, which might le&s;&s;en it in their e&s;teem, and di&s;courage &s;ome from adventuring them|&s;elves or their fortunes thither) I was de&s;ired by &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality, to give a more particu|lar account thereof, in ob&s;ervance of who&s;e commands, and re&s;pect I bear the place, I promi&s;ed my endeavours, but mu&s;t be very brief, for that the Book is in the Pre&s;s ready to come forth; wherein I may be the more ex|cu&s;able &s;ince a Gentleman who has lived long in, and very well knows that flouri&s;hing Country, hath here already given &s;o good a de&s;cription of the I&s;land which (as he &s;aith) was taken from the
<PB REF="15"><HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Year 1655, and I may add in the <HI>7th.</HI> year of his now Maje&s;ties Reign, who when he came to exerci&s;e His Royal Authority was plea&s;ed to own what his Subjects had done (which was the &s;ame as if he had Commi&s;&s;ionated them) and among other his glorious Ti|tles de&s;cended to &s;tile him&s;elf Lord of <HI>Jamaica</HI> by who&s;e &s;pe|cial grace and favour we have hitherto all the Laws and Pri|viledges of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men exer|ci&s;ed and continued among&s;t us there. The&s;e Acts now Printed being only By-Laws for better Government of the Plantation (which in &s;ome ca&s;e requires diffe|rent Regulations from the King|dom of <HI>England,</HI> as &s;ome Coun|ties for Stanneries, Fens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB REF="16">do here) and for rai&s;ing &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary cu&s;toms as may defray the Publick charge of that Coun|try, for all Judges and Ju&s;tices in <HI>Jamaica</HI> determine all Pleas there according to the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> pur&s;uant whereunto that I&s;land hath been Govern'd, except &s;ome little Variations for ea&s;e and benefit of a new &s;ettle|ment, as our proceedings being all in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> our pleading ge|neral I&s;&s;ues and giving &s;pecial matters in evidence, our &s;uits being more conci&s;e and far le&s;s chargeable than in <HI>England,</HI> the Practice of our Courts there much more plain and intelligible. To begin with his Maje&s;ties Su|pream Court of <HI>Judicature</HI> (&s;o called) which hath the &s;ame Ju|ri&s;diction with the <HI>Kings-Bench,
<PB REF="16">Common-Pleas, and Exche|quer</HI> at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and is held <HI>4</HI> times in the year as the Terms in <HI>England, viz.</HI> every la&s;t Tue&s;day in <HI>February, May, Au|gu&s;t</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> which con|tinue each time about a Week, and therein are fir&s;t determin'd all Pleas of the Crown, then follow <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> &amp;c. The Judges of that Court being Commi&s;&s;ion'd by his Maje&s;ty or his Gover|nours are always <HI>5</HI> or <HI>7</HI> whereof not le&s;s than <HI>3</HI> can try any cau&s;e and they con&s;i&s;t of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Gentlemen of the I&s;land both for Parts and E&s;tates, and u&s;ually the Chief Ju&s;tice is one of the be&s;t Quality, who hath practi&s;ed and is well read in the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> tho few of them are &s;o learned as the Judges
<PB REF="17">here, yet they are Men of the greate&s;t &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on (whereon all Law is or &s;hould be grounded) This Court is not Burthen'd with many Officers, for one called the Clerk of the Grand Court is <HI>Prothonotary Cu&s;tos brevium,</HI> &amp;c. Nor do we trouble our &s;elves with many &s;orts of Writs, as <HI>Ori|ginals, Capias, Alias</HI> or <HI>Pluries,</HI> very rarely or never, arre&s;ting any Per&s;on of known re&s;idence, on|ly &s;end him a Summons to appear next Court, and that he may come provided, a Copy of the De|claration is always left with the Summons, which being &s;erved <HI>8</HI> days at lea&s;t before the Court, the Defendant is bound to appear, plead, joyn i&s;&s;ue, and come to Tryal the very next Court, or Judgment will pa&s;s by default,
<PB REF="17">no Imparlance being allowed with|out &s;pecial cau&s;e, as on oath that he hath material Witne&s;&s;es, and hath endeavoured, but cannot <HI>Subpoena</HI> them. In Tryals we have not &s;everal <HI>Venire's</HI> nor a particular Jury for every cau&s;e, unle&s;s in &s;ome &s;pecial matter of great import, but by a gene|ral <HI>Venire,</HI> the Mar&s;hal pre|pares enough for four or five &s;etts of Jurors, not knowing what i&s;&s;ues they are to Try (which prevents packing or par|tial returns) who are impannel'd in Court, and put upon the Crown &s;ide, or Common Pleas, in &s;uch cau&s;es as the Judges extempore direct.

<PB REF="18">bear, for help whereof &s;ome of them take Notes; al&s;o they are permitted to take with them the Record it &s;elf with all Papers or Deeds proved in Court, mo&s;t of our actions there being plain matters of Debt or Accompt and &s;ome few Ejectments, Writs of Dower, Partition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Ju|rors indor&s;e their Verdict on each Record which is deliver'd in Court to the Clark, who of cour&s;e enters Judgment unle&s;s it be arre&s;ted, which every one may move the la&s;t day of the Court, but is rarely granted without very &s;pecial cau&s;e pre|&s;ently made appear; but if &s;uch motions are ever favoured it is in exce&s;&s;ive damages on action of Slander or frivolous Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es which are u&s;ually di&s;coun|tenanced;
<PB REF="18">we are not intreagu'd with dilatory Writs of Inquiry, but when any judgment is con|fe&s;s'd or pa&s;&s;eth by <HI>nil dicit</HI> in ca&s;e, &amp;c. the next Jury happen|ing to be trying i&s;&s;ues in Court take the Record and A&s;&s;e&s;s Da|mages pre&s;ently. And for ea&s;e of tho&s;e who live by their labour to prevent unnece&s;&s;ary atten|dance and expences, all Actions depending that Court or Term, are called and tryed alphabeti|cally beginning with the Plain|tiffs names; &s;o all parties witne&s;|&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may gue&s;s on what day &s;uch a letter may come on, and accordingly give their atten|dance. Fourteen days after the beginning of the Court Execu|tion i&s;&s;ues, for which we have but one Writ comprehending both
<PB REF="19">a <HI>Fieri fac</HI> and <HI>Capias ad &s;at. (viz.)</HI> to levy the Debt and Co&s;ts of the Defendants Goods, or if he have none, then, to take his bo|dy, but becau&s;e no general Impar|lance is allowed before, we in a Manner give one after Judg|ment: For that no man may be ruined by ha&s;ty &s;urpri&s;e and &s;ale of his goods, the &s;ame after &s;ei|zure in Execution may be retur|ned, but mu&s;t be left in the De|fendants hands to di&s;po&s;e to mo&s;t advantage (if he end not with the Plaintiff) &s;o as to bring the money into next Court, where|in if he fails, then a <HI>Venditi|oni exponas</HI> i&s;&s;ues to the Mar|&s;hal to &s;ell them or any other goods or take his body: Before or after which the Defendant is at liberty to bring his Writ of Er|ror
<PB REF="19">returnable before the Gover|nour and Council though it is very rarely practi&s;ed, &s;uch Writs meeting with very little encou|ragement in ju&s;t Debts. His Maje&s;ty hath al&s;o con&s;tituted in this I&s;land a Court of <HI>Chan|cery</HI> wherein the Governour him|&s;elf always &s;its as Chancellour, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;everal di&s;creet Gen|tlemen of eminency as Ma&s;ters, where Cau&s;es are &s;peedily deter|mined without tho&s;e delays and expences u&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> There are al&s;o in every Pari&s;h or County monthly Courts erected for tryal of all Actions under Twenty pounds, or <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> with a <HI>Ju&s;ticies</HI> out of <HI>Chancery,</HI> which the Governour cautiou&s;ly grants on &s;pecial occa&s;ions. Of Judg|ments
<PB REF="20">in the&s;e Courts Writs of Error lie retornable at the &s;u|pream Court, but rarely brought for rea&s;on afore&s;aid. Then eve|ry Ju&s;tice of Peace (be&s;ides the authority of a Ju&s;tice in <HI>England</HI>) hath power of hol|ding a Court of Con&s;cience for all matters not exceeding Fourty &s;hillings value. The Quarter Se&s;&s;ions are al&s;o held in each Pa|ri&s;h or County after the manner of <HI>England,</HI> and there is a Court of Admiralty at the Town of <HI>Port Royal</HI> for tryal of Piracy and deciding other Maritime af|fairs, from whence we have the liberty of appealing to the Governour there, or to his Maje&s;ty in Council here for redre&s;s. The Governour al|&s;o
<PB REF="20">hath power (as Ordinary of the Dioce&s;s) for <HI>probate</HI> of Wills, granting Admini&s;trations and determining all controver&s;ies concerning the &s;ame; But Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical or Spiritual Courts are not yet known in this I|&s;land, Nor are Purcha&s;ers here incumbred with bad Titles for that Regi&s;ter (&s;o much wi&s;hed for in <HI>England</HI>) is here e&s;tabli&s;h|ed where all Conveyances being acknowledged are to be enroll'd within three months, if the Cog|ni&s;ors inhabit there; But if any per&s;ons Feme Coverts or others re&s;iding in <HI>England,</HI> and inte|re&s;ted in any Lands or Planta|tions there &s;hall de&s;ire to di&s;|po&s;e of the &s;ame here, they mu&s;t &s;eal and deliver their deeds be|fore two or more credible Per|&s;ons
<PB REF="21">going for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who at|te&s;ting the &s;ame before a Judge there, the &s;ame may be enrolled in Six months, and &s;hall be as <HI>valid</HI> in Law, as if done by Fine, Recovery or otherwi&s;e. In which ca&s;e I &s;hould advi&s;e the Purcha&s;er to take by way of Lea&s;e and Relea&s;e, and to have two parts at lea&s;t of each, with Covenants for further a&s;&s;urance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that if one part happen to mi&s;carry, he may require ano|ther, yet &s;o as always to keep one here, le&s;t any breach of Cove|nants &s;hould happen. And &s;ince this publick Regi&s;ter or Office of Enrolments is found of &s;uch ge|neral u&s;e, that no Purcha&s;er or Lender of money can be decei|ved in his Title, it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable (for advancement
<PB REF="21">of our Plantation Trade, and con&s;equently enriching our na|tive Country of <HI>England,</HI> the great Receptacle of all our wealth) to encourage monied men (who expo&s;e it here at <HI>4,</HI> and <HI>5. per cent.</HI> yet cannot get &s;atisfactory &s;ecurity) to adven|ture &s;ome of it for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they may have unque&s;tio|nable &s;ecurity, by men of vi&s;ible e&s;tates, or good Mortgages, for neither Per&s;ons nor E&s;tates can be there incumbred, but they mu&s;t be di&s;cover'd either by the afore|&s;aid Regi&s;ter or report of their Neighbours, who generally more intimately know and better ob|&s;erve each others Affairs than they can in <HI>England.</HI> Nor was it ever known that any Mortgage hath been defeated or Title pro|ved
<PB REF="22">defective where compared and agreeing with the Regi&s;ter, &s;o that any Per&s;ons having mo|nies here to put out, may remit the &s;ame to <HI>Jamaica</HI> by Bills of of Exchange at <HI>20 per cent.</HI> or in Commodities (by advice of Merchants here) at <HI>40,</HI> or <HI>50 per cent.</HI> or more advance, and lend the &s;ame at <HI>10 per cent.</HI> running only (in Commodi|ties) the ri&s;que of the Sea which al&s;o is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it may be en&s;ured for about <HI>2 per cent.</HI> But when they recal their moneys they may expect <HI>15,</HI> or <HI>20 per cent.</HI> lo&s;s on their returns though &s;ometimes they gain al&s;o back which lo&s;s when it happens may be attributed to the difference of our Coyns here and there, <HI>Jamaica</HI> money being
<PB REF="22">about &frac15; more in value there than it will yield in <HI>England.</HI> And &s;uch Adventurers have this fur|ther encouragement, that all real Securities there are <HI>meliorated</HI> (being certainly emprovable) the longer they continue planted, whereas lands here u&s;ually de|crea&s;e in value. It might al&s;o turn to much greater advantage then the be&s;t way of employing money in <HI>England</HI> To purcha&s;e Plantations there, many good penniworths frequently offering, as may be found by inquiry here of &s;uch as have e&s;tates there, though u&s;ually tho&s;e that have lea&s;t do mo&s;t undervalue the place: For if <HI>Jamaica</HI> lie under any ill character &s;he owes it to &s;ome few Prodigals who having Riotou&s;ly con&s;umed that little
<PB REF="23">they carried thither, and being through ignorance or lazine&s;s in|capable of any imploy, come home and rail again&s;t the Country, to ju&s;tifie their unprofitable voyage and return. There is al&s;o ano|ther imputation on <HI>Jamaica,</HI> viz. the difficulty of getting due returns and recovery of ju&s;t Debts. To the fir&s;t it hath u&s;u|ally more noi&s;e than &s;ub&s;tance, for many men of declining fortunes, to deceive their Creditors, or otherwi&s;e, boa&s;t of great concerns there, and di&s;appointments by their Factors and Agents, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> when really they have little or nothing in the I&s;land, for if they had, the Law is open and much more cheap and expeditious re|medies to be u&s;ed there than in <HI>England,</HI> though indeed as to
<PB REF="23">the &s;econd &s;ome have herein met with ob&s;tructions partly occa&s;io|ned by a former Law indulging all new Comers for <HI>5</HI> years a|gain&s;t pro&s;ecutions for forreign Debts: But that being now thought a di&s;paragement to &s;o po|pulous and opulent a Colony, was di&s;lik't by the Lords Committees and is not confirmed: Other inconveniencies &s;ome have met with for want of due infor|mation how to draw their proofs an procurations: I would not encourage any litigious &s;uits, but for in&s;truction of hone&s;t Cre|ditors again&s;t able Debtors, I &s;hould pre&s;cribe this method, that all Letters of Attorny be Atte&s;t|ed by Per&s;ons going thither, who may prove the &s;ame <HI>viv&acirc; voce,</HI> which being recorded there, is
<PB REF="24">good though the witne&s;&s;es die or return, whereas Per&s;ons u&s;ually &s;end procurations under Corpo|ration &s;eals which are not there admitted for that better proofs may be ea&s;ily had as afore&s;aid; But &s;uch cannot always be found for Debt: In &s;uch ca&s;e the Law there is &s;o favourable to admit depo&s;itions atte&s;ted under the &s;eal of the City of <HI>London</HI> or other Corporations, but then the Plaintiff would do well to give due credit on Oath for what he hath received, or el&s;e the De|fendant may have ju&s;t occa&s;ion (with &s;ecurity) to delay him by Injunction till he an&s;wer his Bill in <HI>Chancery:</HI> Or if the Debt accrews by <HI>Specialtie,</HI> the Ori|ginal bond it &s;elf mu&s;t go over, it being unrea&s;onable to recover
<PB REF="24">again&s;t any man on a Copy, yet the Bond it &s;elf lie out again&s;t him; nor can indor&s;ments nor truth &s;o well appear unle&s;s pro|duced in Court. If any Bill of exchange be drawn from <HI>Jamai|ca</HI> which will not be paid here, one of the original Bills mu&s;t go back doubly prote&s;ted as well for <HI>non acceptance</HI> as for <HI>non pay|ment,</HI> and in mi&s;taking the&s;e or &s;uch like mea&s;ures (grounded upon Law and Rea&s;on) many have been baffled or delayed and then cau&s;le&s;ly reflect on the Ju|&s;tice of the I&s;land. This is what occurs at pre&s;ent about our Temporal Laws. I may al&s;o add that the People are gene|rally of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and I am confident, in no part of the Kings Dominions hath his
<PB REF="25">Maje&s;ty more truly Loyal Sub|jects for the number of its Inhabi|tants, than are in <HI>Jamaica:</HI> We have very few Papi&s;ts or Secta|ries, for neither Je&s;uits or Non|conformi&s;t Par&s;ons do or can live among us; &s;ome few have at|tempted, but never could gain Pro&s;elytes enough to afford them &s;u&s;tenance (though all except Pa|pi&s;ts may freely exerci&s;e what Re|ligion they plea&s;e without di&s;tur|bance) But for able orthodox Di|vines there is &s;o great encourage|ment that it's to be admired &s;o many can content them&s;elves with &s;uch mean or no Benefices in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> when they may &s;o comfor|tably &s;ub&s;i&s;t in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for that they are certainly provided for by an Act intituled, <HI>For Mainte|nance of Mini&s;ters,</HI> which &s;ee in
<PB REF="25">this Book <HI>Folio 124.</HI> Be&s;ides which allowances, in mo&s;t Pa|ri&s;hes the Contingencies by vo|luntary pre&s;ents for Chri&s;tenings, Marriages, Buryings, and o|therwi&s;e with Hou&s;es taking Boarders, Schooling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> make con&s;iderable additions. So that they may live comfortably and lay up; Victuals being as plen|tiful and of the &s;ame &s;orts for Butchers meat, tame and wild Fowl, Fi&s;h, Bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (with more variety) as in <HI>England,</HI> with this difference that we have green Peas, Beans, Cherries, A&s;paragus, Musk and water Mel|lons, Pines, Grapes, Oranges, Pomgranats, Citrons, Lemons and hundreds of &s;everal other &s;orts of Fruits in &s;ea&s;on all the year long. But &s;ome are apt to
<PB REF="26">object the hazard of the Voyage, and unhealthine&s;s of the place; as to the fir&s;t, It's as &s;afe going to <HI>Jamaica</HI> as to go in a Wherry on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> where more Boats are ca&s;t away in proportion than Ships going for that I&s;land, for we &s;oon come into a trade Wind and pre&s;ently &s;ail be|fore it, almo&s;t con&s;tantly blow|ing from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, that is from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> It being rarely known that any Ve&s;|&s;els mi&s;carry going thither. And this is evident enough if we con|&s;ider the common rate of En&s;u|rers at two <HI>per cent.</HI> who are men of fore&s;ight and experience never propo&s;ing le&s;s then doub|ling their money which they can|not do if but one Ship in an hun|dred mi&s;carry, yet that doth not
<PB REF="26">happen in time of Peace. Then as to the unhealthine&s;s of the Climate, (there are &s;ome who never were abroad think all places beyond Sea much alike, &s;o that having heard of &s;ickne&s;s and &s;ea&s;onings for new comers in places lately &s;etled they are apt to impute it without any rea&s;on to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the Air being always &s;erene and weather con&s;tantly temperate, though u&s;ually re|puted very hot, yet it's only &s;o comparatively in re&s;pect of the&s;e Northern Climates, being with us always Summer as if every Month were <HI>June.</HI> I have ob|&s;erved and can experimentally affirm for Twelve years la&s;t pa&s;t <HI>Jamaica</HI> to be as healthful a place as any part of <HI>England,</HI> for &s;ober temperate per&s;ons, who
<PB REF="27">have command of them&s;elves, e|&s;pecially at fir&s;t arrival, and can moderately drink one third Wine with two thirds Water, but one the other &s;ide I think it as pernicious a place to debauch in, as any in the World, and this &s;o nece&s;&s;ary vertue of &s;obriety be|ing more habitual in the other Sex, makes the place far le&s;s fatal to them then men, whereof u&s;ually ten dye in proportion for one Woman, as appears by the yearly Bills of Mortality on <HI>Port Royal</HI> (which is the <HI>London</HI> of <HI>Jamaica</HI>) and it is not ex|traordinary, if we al&s;o con&s;ider the nature of the Climate (as it really is,) mo&s;t propitious to Child-bearing Women who are not &s;o &s;ubject to Mi&s;carriages, Di&s;tem|pers, Pains or Difficulties before,
<PB REF="27">at or after Delivery, as they are in <HI>England,</HI> for being always Sum|mer, there is no danger of catch|ing colds, nor need of Fires in their Chambers, no Rooms there having any Chimnies except the Kitchen which is u&s;ually apart from the dwelling hou&s;e. In <HI>Jamaica</HI> the Women after Child|bed are &s;trong and lu&s;ty at three days end, and about Hou&s;e again in a week; nay &s;ome <HI>Negro</HI> Women are at work in the Field the &s;ame or next day. I have been often que&s;tioned about the Natives of our I&s;land whether they were not a terror to us, <HI>&amp;c</HI> It may not therefore be imper|tinent to declare that <HI>Jamaica</HI> is wholly Inhabited with <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> who found none there but <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which were &s;oon
<PB REF="28">beaten off, and are long &s;ince in battel or by flight extirpated, though perhaps it was formerly very populous with <HI>Indians,</HI> but tho&s;e were de&s;troyed by the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> &s;o that we have no Na|tives at pre&s;ent but Chil|dren of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or their <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves (which are im|ported thither as Merchandize from <HI>Guiney</HI> and other parts of <HI>Africa</HI>) of whom we are in no &s;uch fear or danger as in le&s;&s;er I&s;lands. But <HI>Jamaica</HI> is of too va&s;t an extent for any &s;uch &s;urprize, being in many places divided with mountains of dif|ficult acce&s;s, and great Rivers not pa&s;&s;able but by Boats or Ferries, which dare carry no <HI>Ne|groes</HI> without a written Tick|et or Licence from their Ma&s;ter
<PB REF="28">or Over&s;eer. And if any Slave be found wandring out of his Ma&s;ters Plantation any per&s;on may &s;eize and carry him to his Owner or next Of|ficer and receive a certain reward. By which and other expedient me|thods, it's &s;afer living or travelling in <HI>Jamaica</HI> than <HI>England,</HI> we having rarely any Hou&s;e-breaking or Robbery, for want of receivers, mo&s;t per&s;ons there generally knowing each other as they do in Country Cities here, though there are few Inns for Travel|lers, yet they are better and cheaper accommodated at Planter Hou&s;es, who are generally very Ho&s;pitable and are conveniently di&s;per&s;ed over the whole I&s;land, for all <HI>Jamaica</HI> is &s;et|led by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from one end to the other, though in &s;ome places more thin than others. The Hou&s;es indeed are not &s;o clo&s;e as in &s;ome parts of <HI>England,</HI> yet u&s;ually the Planta|tions are contiguous, for a great Sugar work requires &s;ome hundreds of Acres for Canes, Wood, Provi&s;ions, Pa&s;ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet mo&s;t of the Planters, are
<PB REF="29">forward enough to &s;pare &s;ome of it to a good Neighbour on rea&s;onable terms. The Wood-lands are common|ly cleared and u&s;ed for Planting, but there are va&s;t even Meadows called <HI>Savannas,</HI> for grazing of Hor&s;es, Cattel, Sheep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we never cut nor make any Hay of, having Gra&s;s all the year long, though &s;ome|times a little too much dryed or &s;corched by the Sun, when many pur|po&s;ely &s;et it one Fire, the a&s;hes whereof mannure and emprove the Ground again&s;t another Crop, which will &s;uddenly &s;pring again with the next gentle &s;howers or without, by the great dews which there fall in the night, and in the mean time the Cattle retire to other pa&s;tures in &s;hady Woods or lower Mar&s;hes; it is al&s;o ob&s;ervable that our Hor&s;es are generally &s;wift, but few or none of them &s;hod, yet will gallop the mo&s;t &s;tony way, and climb &s;teep Rocks like Goats, nor are they troubled with near &s;o many di&s;tempers as Hor&s;es in <HI>England,</HI> it being common (though
<PB REF="29">never &s;o hot or hard ridden) to turn them pre&s;ently grazing, but the Hor&s;es are u&s;ually of &s;o &s;mall a breed that all Gentlemens Coaches (which are there very numerous) go with &s;ix Hor&s;es a piece, we have al&s;o &s;e|veral Hackney-Coaches. The man|ner of living there for gallantry, good Hou&s;ekeeping and Recreations (as Hor&s;e-Races, Bowls, Dancing, Mu&s;ick, Plays at a publick Theatre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate the flouri&s;hing condition of the I&s;land, yearly increa&s;ing as well in number of Inhabitants as in wealth and plen|ty, being mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;o that we drain the benefits of their Gold and Silver Mines without their Labour and expences. The Town of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> being as it were the Store|hou&s;e or Trea&s;ury of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> is always like a continual Mart or Fair where all &s;orts of choice Merchandizes are daily imported not only to furni&s;h the I&s;land, but va&s;t quantities are thence again Tran&s;ported to &s;upply
<PB REF="30">the <HI>Spaniards, Indians,</HI> and other Nations, who in exchange return us bars and cakes of Gold, wedges and piggs of Silver, Pi&s;tols, Pieces of Eight, and &s;everal other Coyns of both Mettles, with &s;tore of wrought Plate, Jewels, rich Pearl Necklaces, and of Pearl un&s;orted or undrill'd &s;everal Bu&s;hels; be&s;ides which, we are furni&s;hed with the pure&s;t and mo&s;t fine &s;orts of du&s;t Gold from <HI>Gui|ney,</HI> by the <HI>Negro</HI> Ships, who fir&s;t come to <HI>Jamaica</HI> to deliver their Blacks, and there u&s;ually refit and &s;tay to reload three or four Months, in which time (though the Companies Gold may be partly &s;ent home) yet the Merchants, Ma&s;ters of Ships, and almo&s;t every Mariner (having pri|vate Cargoes) take occa&s;ion to &s;ell or exchange great quantities; &s;ome of which our Gold&s;miths there work up (who being yet but few) grow very wealthy, for almo&s;t every Hou&s;e hath a rich Cupboard of Plate which they carele&s;ly expo&s;e, &s;carce &s;hutting their doors in the night, being in no
<PB REF="30">apprehen&s;ion of Thieves for want of Receivers as afore&s;aid. And where|as mo&s;t other Plantations ever did and now do keep their accounts in Sugar, or the proper Commodities of the place, for want of Money, it is otherwi&s;e in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for in <HI>Port Royal</HI> there is more plenty of run|ning Ca&s;h (Proportionally to the number of its Inhabitants than is in <HI>London,</HI> which (among other wor|thy Acts) we chiefly owe to the pro|vident care of his excellency Sir <HI>Thomas Lynch</HI> our pre&s;ent and for|mer Governour, who about Ten years ago (by advice of his Maje&s;ties Council there) rai&s;ed the value of our current Coyns about &frac15; more than they will yield in any other part of Chri&s;tendom, &s;o that none care to car|ry Money off but bring great quantities thither, which occa&s;ions the daily in|crea&s;e of our Sugar works and other profitable Plantations, and gives great incouragement to the Gentle|men Planters in other adjacent I&s;lands and Plantatione to remove
<PB REF="31">and &s;ettle among&s;t us, being there obliged to u&s;e tra&s;h, and Sea-Coals to boyl their Sugar (which renders it not &s;o good as when made with quick wood fires;) nor are they here at &s;o great charge for Hor&s;es and Cattle to do their work, nor pent up in &s;uch narrow Plantations for want of Land as in tho&s;e &s;mall I&s;lands, nor &s;ubject to many other incon|veniencies incident to little Coun|tries and &s;mall numbers of People. This I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> being very Capacious, and &s;upply'd both from abroad and in it &s;elf with great Plenty of all things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
