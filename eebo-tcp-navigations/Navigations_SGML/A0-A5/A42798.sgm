TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Good Reception the World afforded to the Fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion of the greater part of the following Sheets, has en|gaged me to &s;end 'em again abroad, ina more exact dre&s;s, and with con&s;iderable Additi|ons. You will find in the&s;e <HI>Memoires</HI> a number of things which have e&s;cap'd the vi|gilance of all former Travellers. Fir&s;t you have a De&s;cription of all the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape-Verd;</HI> From whence the Author Sayling to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> where he &s;tays long enough to know the Quality of the Country, and the Manners of the Inhabi|tants, whereof he gives &s;o exact a De&s;crip|tion, that nothing &s;eems to be omitted.</P>
<P>Then he pur&s;ues his Voyage to the I&s;le of <HI>Java Major,</HI> of which, and e&s;pecially of the Kingdom of <HI>BANTAM,</HI> he gives &s;o particular an account, that it equally &s;erves to the Readers in&s;truction and entertain|ment; is both profitable and agreeable.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
What he &s;ays afterwards of <HI>SIAM,</HI> is no le&s;s u&s;eful and plea&s;ant. He relates circum&s;tances of that Country as were not yet known; and the De&s;cription he makes of it is &s;o perfect and delightful, that it is ea&s;ie to perceive he him&s;elf took a &s;ingular plea|&s;ure therein. I &s;ay nothing of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> whereof he only &s;peaks by the by, tho what he &s;ays thereof, teaches us that all Men are not made after the &s;ame manner. He ends his Voyage with a De&s;cription of <HI>Nangue|&s;iaque,</HI> and of the Manners of the <HI>Japane|zes,</HI> whereof he gives a pretty, tho &s;hort ac|count, knowing there have been great Volumes upon that Subject. And this Edition be|ing perfect and correct, I do not que&s;tion but the Reader will give it even a more favou|rable entertainment than the former; e&s;pe|cially being all along interwoven with &s;uch &s;urprizing Cercum&s;tances and Stories, as will undoubtedly render the peru&s;al of it ve|ry delightful; particularly at this Jun|cture, when an Amba&s;&s;ador from tho&s;e Countries, does make People the more de|&s;irous of an account of this nature.</P>

<P>THO I was Born with a de&s;ire of Travelling, yet there was little probability, I could pur&s;ue my Inclinati|ons: My Father not being Rich, and al&s;o con&s;idering, I might be u&s;eful to him, and to the World, if I learnt an hone&s;t Trade, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to per&s;wade me into an Apprenti&s;hip. What repug|nance &s;oever I might have to that &s;ort of Life, I was forced to obey, at fir&s;t indeed with much difficulty&punc; imagining that
<PB N="2" REF="4">
imploy would be an invincible hinde|tance to the de&s;ign I had&punc; formed of &s;ee|ing other Countries be&s;ides my own; but afterwards with delight, when my Rea&s;on made me know, that what I did, was &s;o far from being an ob&s;tacle to my Inclination, as it opened me a way to the Travels which I meditated. A&s;&s;oon as I perceived this, I was the more fer|vent and brisk at my work; I became more tractable and more a&s;&s;iduous than before. I never heard the Compa&s;s men|tioned without feeling an extraordinary joy; and when I &s;aw Marine Cards, I could never be wear with looking on them. The pa&s;&s;ion of Voyaging did &s;o fortifie it &s;elf in me with Age, that I had hardly attain'd Seventeen Years, but I began to grow weary of the life I led. Methoughts it was time to think of de|parting, the difficulty was to find the means of doing &s;o, and procuring my Fathers con&s;ent. Seeing very little like|lihood of prevailing with him, I became extream Melancholy; the young people who&s;e Company I frequented, knowing the cau&s;e of my &s;adne&s;s, di&s;&s;ipated it by &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es, which revived my hopes that were half dead&punc; and as about that time I happened to let fly &s;ome words,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
which might be ill interpreted; My Fa|ther reprehended me with &s;o much &s;eve|rity, that I left him immediately, and went to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where by good luck having found, that two Ships were fit|ting out for <HI>Genoa,</HI> I engaged my &s;elf in one of them in quality of Boat&s;wain's Mate, being little concerned at the em|ploy I had in it, or the place whither I went, provided only that I might Tra|vel.</P>
<P>On the 26th. of <HI>December</HI> in the Year 1667, having &s;et Sail, we were hardly out of the <HI>Texel,</HI> when we perceived that our two Ships were not well balla&s;ted: thus, the &s;horte&s;t way was to return from whence we came, for the taking in as much Pewter and Che&s;ts of Quick&s;ilver, as was requi&s;ite for the giving them their ju&s;t Weight. After which, we made Sail the &s;econd time, on the fir&s;t of <HI>Jan.</HI> in the following Year, in a time, when the Ice was extreamly thick.</P>
<P>On the 10th. a quite contrary Wind con&s;train'd us to put in at <HI>Dunkirk&punc;</HI> and two days afterwards, the Wind being bet|ter, we pur&s;ued our Cour&s;e; but we went not very far without being obliged to &s;eek out a Haven to &s;helter us from the foul Weather and a very furious Tem|pe&s;t.
<PB N="4" REF="5">
The I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> being pretty near, we put in there and &s;tayed until the 25th. When we weighed Anchor again, but were not de&s;tined without impediment to continue our Cour&s;e&punc; for on the Morrow the Wind came again to be &s;o contrary, that we found it very difficult to get into a Neighbouring Ha|ven.</P>
<P>At length on the 6th. of <HI>February</HI> we ca&s;t Anchor at <HI>Portland,</HI> from whence we Sail'd three days afterwards; and on the 10. the Currents carried us into the Bay of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> becau&s;e they were much &s;tronger than the Wind; but on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> morrow the Wind made us overcom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> them, and was afterwards &s;o favourable to us, that in fifteen days after we came into &s;ight of <HI>Genoa,</HI> when we ca&s;t An|chor behind the old Mole.</P>
<P>On the 29th. of the &s;ame Month, the <HI>Cargo</HI> of the two Ships being unload<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> and di&s;charged, by rea&s;on the Repub+lick bought tho&s;e two Ve&s;&s;els which &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> furni&s;hed with all manner of Ammuni&punc;tion for three Years, and into each of which &s;he put an Hundred Men all <HI>Ger&punc;mans,</HI> except &s;ome few <HI>Bandities.</HI> By this means I became free much &s;oone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> then I expected; but as this liberty di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="5">
put a &s;top to the Pa&s;&s;ion I had of going much farther, I re&punc;ingaged my &s;elf there|in.</P>
<P>While the Ships were fitting out, I &s;a|tisfied the Curio&s;ity I had a long time of &s;eeing that famous City. The Port on the South &s;ide is open, and be&s;et in &s;e|veral places with little Rocks, that lie even with the Water, and are dangerous in Tempe&s;tuous Weather. 'Tis built like an <HI>Amphitheater</HI> round about the Port, and is a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect to the &s;ight. It is about Ten Miles in Com|pa&s;s, &s;urrounded with good Walls; which however have not the appearance of being able to hold out again&s;t a long Siege, at lea&s;t, if the Be&s;ieged do not make extraordinary Efforts to defend them. Their <HI>Militia</HI> is Compo&s;ed of &s;ome Companies of <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Cor&s;es,</HI> and others of light Hor&s;e; &s;ome maintained for the watching along the Coa&s;ts, and di&s;covering the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the others, to hinder any &s;ecret Practices and Con|&s;piraces in the City. The entrance of the Port is defended by Four Galleys, always ready upon occa&s;ion&punc; and there are a great number of them in the Ar|&s;enal, which the <HI>Genouezes</HI> often lend to the <HI>Venetians</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> On
<PB N="6" REF="6">
one &s;ide of the Port &s;tands a Tower con|&s;iderably high, where fires are kindled by night, for the regulating the Cour&s;e of the Ships. There is at the foot of that Tower, a great Piece of Cannon mounted upon its Carriage, which is ne|ver without a Sentinel. The Guard of the Princes Palace is of Five Hundred Men all <HI>Germans,</HI> under a Colonel of the &s;ame Nation, who have their Quarters there. As for the Buildings of the City, they are all far beyond the <HI>Idea</HI> we can conceive of them: all Palaces, all of Mar|ble, e&s;pecially along the Rivers &s;ide. But the Pomp of the Churches does exceed all the&s;e Beauties; there are Thirty Pa|ri&s;h-Churches, in one of which they &s;hew a Key of an exact Figure of an Emerauld perfectly good. In that of St. <HI>Bartholo|mew,</HI> they keep the St. <HI>Suaire,</HI> whither the People flock upon the rumours of the Miracles that are done there. This Ci|ty is very Populous, and the Merchants are there in great numbers and very rich; their Principal Traffick is in Velvet&punc; and we may judge how great it is&punc; by the number of the Workmen who are em|ployed about it; I having been a&s;&s;ured, that there was above Eight Thou&s;and of them at the time I was there.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
On the 12th. of <HI>April</HI> we made Sail towards <HI>Velez Malga,</HI> whither we came in Four Weeks, from whence after two days repo&s;e, we made for <HI>Malgue,</HI> where we ca&s;t Anchor on the 24th. of <HI>May.</HI> We were no &s;ooner there, but all the <HI>Bandities</HI> were &s;et on Shore, and &s;ince that time we never heard of any of them. 'Tis well known how famous that Coun|try is for its Wine; whereof we took an Hundred Pipes on board us, and af|ter having provided our &s;elves with ne|ce&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments for the Sick, on the 29th. of <HI>May</HI> the Wind &s;econding our De&s;igns, we weighed Anchor and made Sail towards <HI>Cap-Verd,</HI> where we were to &s;tay and repo&s;e our &s;elves for &s;ome time. This de&s;ign made us judge, that the Voyage mu&s;t needs be long; but none except the Officers, knew our in|tention, or whither we went.</P>
<P>The 4<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> at night we found our &s;elves near 9 Ships which we took for <HI>Cor&s;aires.</HI> We were quickly &s;atisfi|ed of the Truth; for the Men of tho&s;e Ships having asked us, who we were, and from whence we came, we found they were <HI>Algermes.</HI> This News did &s;ome|thing Alarum our Commander; but as he was brave, far from &s;hewing, that he
<PB N="8" REF="7">
was &s;tartled at this rencounter, he told the <HI>Cor&s;aires</HI> with a very good grace, that he only waited till break of day to make an Acquaintance with them, and he &s;hould take it for an Obligation, would they come on board him, where he would take care that nothing &s;hould be omitted for their being well entertained. At the &s;ame time turning towards our Officers; <HI>You &s;ee Gentlemen,</HI> &s;aid he to them, <HI>what Gue&s;ts we have to Treat, and what Di&s;hes we mu&s;t prepare for their good Reception; they are in great numbers as you &s;ee, but that &s;ignifies nothing, and I hope that our Cou|rage will make them repent of their bold|ne&s;s, if they have &s;o much as to attack us.</HI> They made no An&s;wer to the Com|manders Speech, but every one running to his Po&s;t, gave him to under&s;tand the re&s;olution they were in, of making a brave defence. And indeed, a&s;&s;oon as it was day, tho the Match was very unequal, all was di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a man|ner, that we had a kind of di&s;plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Enemies, who had the advantage of the Wind, make away from us with|out &s;aying a word more. From that time the Heavens were &s;o favourable to us, that at the three Weeks end we found our &s;elves near the I&s;land of <HI>Boa-vi&s;ta.</HI> We
<PB N="9" REF="7">
had no &s;ooner ca&s;t Anchor there, than the <HI>Bandities,</HI> who inhabit it, brought us a great Quantity of &s;alted Goats-fle&s;h and other refre&s;hments. After which we loaded about ten Chaloupes with Salt. This I&s;land does &s;o abound in all &s;orts of Fi&s;h, that provided, People fi&s;h ne're &s;o little there, they take as many as they plea&s;e: e&s;pecially the great Salmon-Trouts are there in &s;o great abundance, that we took above fifteen Hundred of them in the &s;pace of half a day.</P>
<P><HI>Boa-vi&s;ta</HI> is one of the I&s;lands of <HI>Cap|verd.</HI> Both near, and at a di&s;tance, noth|ing can be more agreeable to the &s;ight; and it is for its beauty it has received that name. 'Tis very Mountainous, and about &s;ome 7 Leagues di&s;tance from the I&s;le of <HI>Sabu.</HI> 'Tis about Twenty Leagues in Circumference, and 'tis very hot. It has towards the North a bank of Sand of about Twenty Leagues in Length, a|gain&s;t which the Sea makes a terrible Noi&s;e. There are &s;ome other Banks <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o as dangerous as that, which have occa|&s;ioned the lo&s;s of &s;everal Ships. On the South &s;ide, there's a &s;helve of the &s;ame length as the former, but it is likewi&s;e be&s;et with Rocks, who&s;e tops are &s;ome|times &s;een above Water; its extent is
<PB N="10" REF="8">
more towards the North, and the &s;u|re&s;t place of Ancorage is on the South-We&s;t, where is but fifteen, &s;ixteen, or &s;eventeen Fathom Water at the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>In advancing towards the South, we found the I&s;le of <HI>May;</HI> that I&s;land is a|bout Eight or Nine Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Boa-vi&s;ta,</HI> and is without contradiction, the &s;malle&s;t of all the I&s;lands of <HI>Cap-verd,</HI> having but Eight Leagues in Circum|ference. In the mid&s;t of it &s;tands high Mountains; and towards the North is &s;een a Plain of above a League in Breadth&punc; 'Tis likewi&s;e on that &s;ide, that there is a great extent of Sand, which reaches a great way into the Sea; there is al&s;o, One towards the We&s;t, which renders the Sea very dangerous on that part. The figure of this I&s;land is round, it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Length and Breadth being almo&s;t aqual&punc; It is bordered with &s;everal little Points&punc; which make as many Capes.

Skins are white, and not &s;o tawny as the re&s;t. The&s;e love Women to that degree, that if they meet with one, they help one another to violate her every one in his turn, after which they tear her in pieces. There are tho&s;e, who&s;e Eyes &s;parkle like burning Coales; the&s;e are look'd upon as much the &s;iner; but they are &s;o wild, that when they are taken they &s;tarve them&s;elves to Death. They have great Numbers of Martins, Wea&s;els and Squirrels, as likewi&s;e Scorpions, Spi|ders, Chee&s;elips, and other hurtful Ani|mals, who&s;e Venom is &s;o &s;ubtile, that 'tis pre&s;ent Death to them who are &s;tung. All manner of Gumm is there very plen|tiful. The I&s;land is inhabited both by Whites and Blacks; the&s;e are for the mo&s;t part of a middle Stature; and their Hair is black and Curled: The Whites are &s;omewhat bigger, their Hair is le&s;s black, le&s;s frizled, and much longer; they &s;have their Beards, and are tracta|ble and humane, becau&s;e they inhabit to|wards the Coa&s;ts. But they who dwell in the mid&s;t of the I&s;land, never &s;have their Beards, nor cut their Hair.

who are the be&s;t in&s;tructed in 'em are the mo&s;t e&s;teemed; but Charity and Com|pa&s;&s;ion are Mon&s;ters which they have a horrour for; and tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t grain of them, are reviled and con|temned. Idlene&s;s is natural to 'em, and they &s;pend mo&s;t of their time in &s;inging and dancing. Notwith&s;tanding which, they have Workmen, as Smiths, Carpen|ters, Potters, Cord-makers, and Weavers that are expert enough in their Trades; &s;ome Gold&s;miths they have, but they are none of the mo&s;t dexterous.

<P>The places, whither they retire, are very pitiful Cottages, which neverthele&s;s they are u&s;ed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of with as much joy, as if they were the mo&s;t glo|rious Palaces. When the&s;e Hutts are in a condition to be inhabited, the Proprietors fix the day of their Entrance, and make a Fea&s;t, to which they invite their Relations and Friends; every one goes thither with Pre&s;ents, for it is forbidden to come with empty hands; and tho&s;e pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;t of Gold, Silver, Iron, Corn and Uten&s;ils, that are in u&s;e with 'em.

largely re-imbur&s;ed for his Building and his Entertainment. The Fea&s;t la&s;ts for &s;ome days, during which they commit &s;everal Exce&s;&s;es. Their way of living is very plain, for they have neither Tables, Chairs, Seats, Table-Cloathes, Nap|kins, Beds or Pillows. In&s;omuch that whether it be for eating or drinking, they have only a pitiful Mat &s;pread up|on the Floor.</P>
<P>The Common People go almo&s;t all naked, and often without hiding what we dare not di&s;cover. Per&s;ons of Qua|lity have a kind of Drawers, which rea|ches down to the middle of their Legs; the re&s;t of the body is covered very negligently with a piece of Cotton. The Women are clothed with certain Robes, which reach but to their knees: &s;ome of tho&s;e Robes have Sleeves, and others none. They wear under them a kind of Drawers, which differs little from tho&s;e of the Men. They have a Handkerchief upon their Necks, much like to tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> Tho&s;e Robes are made of Cotton, rinds of Trees, and of Silk of &s;everal Co|lours, garni&s;hed with Guimps and La|ces, that differ much from the colour of the Stuffs. All the Inhabitants of

both Sexes, go bare-headed and bare-footed; except tho&s;e who are of a cer|tain Race, who&s;e Men wear a Bonnet much like a <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> Cap; and the Wo|men an Hood or Ornament in form of a Pyramid which falls down upon their Shoulders.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are Celebrated with very few Ceremonies, and upon very &s;light pretexts the Men put away their Wives. As it is neither a &s;in nor &s;can|dal to Care&s;s one another, the Men and Women make no &s;cruple of doing &s;o; and when Lovers are taken in the Fact, they are acquitted for a Pre&s;ent of lit|tle Value. For the Maids to Pro&s;titute them&s;elves is looked upon as a good hone&s;t Trade: the more they gain there|by, the more are they e&s;teemed; and the mo&s;t notorious Gallantry is the mo&s;t ready way to Marriage. It is ac|counted a kind of &s;hame for Maidens not to know what it is before they are Contracted: they mu&s;t fir&s;t of all have made &s;everal Tryals, and when they have not Wit to find Gallants, their Mothers have the goodne&s;s to furni&s;h 'em with the means of &s;o doing, and to teach 'em to keep tho&s;e who&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es they are.

<P>On the 28<HI>th.</HI> we made Sail towards <HI>Indrapoura,</HI> and in our way we took two Joncks more of <HI>Arquin,</HI> that were laded with Pepper, Sandalewood, Cam|phire and &s;uch like things.

<P>From thence we made towards the <HI>Sonda,</HI> and a little after that we were in the <HI>Streights,</HI> Fourteen <HI>Holland</HI> Ships came thundring upon us. They came from <HI>Batavia,</HI> with Orders from the Company to bring us thither either by fair means or foul; immediately they Summon'd our Commander, who ve|ry bravely made An&s;wer, <HI>That he was not a Man to yield till after having bravely defended him&s;elf, and that perhaps, how</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="27">
<HI>&s;trong &s;oever they might be, they would find it difficult to con&s;train him to it.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> not thinking to have met with &s;o re&s;olute a Man, &s;ent to <HI>Ba|tavia</HI> to know what they were to do; the An&s;wer was, that they &s;hould pre&s;s us, and if they found them&s;elves too weak to perform their Commi&s;&s;ions, they &s;hould make u&s;e of the Reinforce|ment that was coming to them, which was a great Man of War advantageou&s;ly fitted out, who&s;e help was in no wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> having re|ceived this Order, bid us with an im|perious Tone, bring to them our Flag and &s;trike Sail, or they would &s;ink us to the bottom. This daunted our Com|mander, who had had time to think of what he was to do: he became pen&s;ive unea&s;ie, and perhaps he had rea&s;on &s;o to be. His Men had &s;till in mind the Di&s;pute at <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> he knew they hated him, and they only waited for an opportunity to be revenged for the af|front he had put upon them. The&s;e Con&s;iderations made him inclinable to yield; but before he came to that Re&s;o|lution, he took Council of his Officers, who were unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, that he &s;hould follow the Law of the Strong|e&s;t,
<PB N="49" REF="27">
&s;ince their lo&s;s was infallible, if they per&s;i&s;ted to make re&s;i&s;tance; this Re&s;o|lution was applauded by all the Ships Crew, who&s;e di&s;union was &s;o vi&s;ible, that they could hardly have lived long|er together: thus the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were received with open Arms. We were o|verjoy'd at the changing of our Ma&s;ters, and never were any Men better plea&s;ed with coming out of Pri&s;on, than our Men were to go into it. If the pa&s;&s;ion of Separating had not been &s;o great among them, it would have been ea&s;ie for them to have made their E&s;cape by Night by the way of <HI>Batavia,</HI> for our Ship was a &s;wift Sailer, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;o heavy, that we were always twen|ty four Hours more advanced than they.</P>
<P>On the 15<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Comman|der of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> called <HI>Jacob vander Meule</HI> came on Board us; and in the General of <HI>Batavia</HI>'s name, took an In|ventory of all he found there. After having written our Names, and the Name of the place of our Birth, tho&s;e whom they met withal of our own Na|tion, were put apart in the <HI>Corps de garde</HI> of <HI>Java;</HI> the others remained in the Ship, who&s;e Coffers they picked,

taking out all the Money they found there, and making their e&s;cape, the <HI>Ita|lians</HI> to <HI>Goa</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> and the <HI>Ham|burghers</HI> to their own Country. Pre|&s;ently after this Plunder, our Comman|der was found dead, and we judged, by the &s;igns he &s;aw upon his Body, that he was poy&s;oned, probably by the <HI>Itali|ans,</HI> for fear he &s;hould have defeated 'em at his return. As for our parts, we were kept Pri&s;oners for fourteen or fifteen days, but having pre&s;ented our reque&s;ts to be &s;et at liberty, we were according|ly &s;et free; and by order of the Gene|ral, each Man having received the Wa|ges he pretended to from the Republick of <HI>Genoa,</HI> it was left to his choice, ei|ther to return into his own Country, or enter into the Service of the Com|pany.

<P>Shortly after my entring into the Ser|vice of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, I was &s;ent by the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> to regu|late &s;ome Affairs at <HI>Bantam,</HI> where having di&s;patched my bu&s;ine&s;s, I took occa&s;ion to make all the inquiry I could into the State of that I&s;land, which take as fol|loweth.</P>

<HI>Bantam</HI> is under the <HI>Antartic</HI> declina|tion or Latitude 6 degrees 20 minutes&punc; and of We&s;terly variation, 3 degrees.

The City Gates are &s;o wretched, that they might be beaten down with a Club; but &s;o vigilantly guarded, 'twould be hard to approach without notice; there are neither Ba&s;tions nor Towers, but in lieu thereof Scaffolds of three Stories, which yield a &s;trong defence.</P>
<P>In the whole City there are but three principal Streets, which all about upon the Ca&s;tle called <HI>Pacebam.</HI> The one from the <HI>Pacebam</HI> to the Haven; another
<PB N="53" REF="29">
where the Kings Slaves and Dome&s;ticks inhabits, leads to the Gate towards the Fields, and the third to the Gate at the foot of the Mountain. The Streets are not pav'd, but are as commodious, by means of the Sand they are covered with. The Channels which in divers places cro&s;s the City, are foul and &s;tink|ing, in regard the Stream of the River is not &s;trong enough to carry off the filth it brings, and what is thrown forth choaks the Water, and makes Puddles, that infect the whole City. No Per|&s;on of Quality, but has his private Chap|pel, or Mo&s;quite in his Hou&s;e; but one is common near the Palace on the Ma|gazin and Stable-&s;ide. The City is di|vided into &s;everal Po&s;ts, each of which is a&s;&s;igned to &s;ome Per&s;on of Quality, who commands in time of War, and gives direction in Civil Affairs. They have a Drum as big as tho&s;e <HI>German</HI> Casks called Thunderbolts, u&s;ed in&s;tead of Bells, which they beat with a wooden|bar as big as a Weavers Beam, Morning and Evening, as al&s;o upon Alarums they have bra&s;s Ba&s;ons, which they beat Mu|&s;ically and Chime upon, as we do our Bells.</P>

At every corner of the Streets there &s;tands a Guard, and at Sun&punc;&s;et they draw up to make fa&s;t all pa&s;&s;age Boats, &s;o as in the Night there is no &s;tirring in the Street. At the Pri&s;on-Gate, near the Palace, &s;tands a Guard of Fifty Men: nor is there a Per&s;on of Quality, who has not one of Ten or Twelve at his Hou&s;e. The Town is full of Coco-Trees, nor is there a Man&s;ion without divers belonging to it. The Hou&s;es are poorly built of Straw Reeds upon Piles made like tho&s;e at <HI>Ackim.</HI> They cover their Hou&s;es with Coco-Leaves, and the &s;ides of their Lodging Rooms have only Curtains for freedom of the Air, which is exceeding nece&s;&s;ary in this hot Climate. For pre&s;ervation of their Wares they have &s;tore Hou&s;es of Stone, but they are covered with &s;traw, &s;o as to &s;ecure them from fire, which is but too fre|quent among&s;t them; they lay great pieces of Timber on the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f, and co|ver it with Sand, that the Fire may not find pa&s;&s;age. The Rooms in their Hou|&s;es are only divided by partitions made of Canes called <HI>Bamboos,</HI> which they &s;lit &s;o thin, that a Hor&s;e-Load &s;erves for all the Rooms in their Hou&s;es. At the Hou&s;es of Per&s;ons of Quality upon

On the Left Hand Merchants of Linnen-Cloth, and at the lower end of this Market, Married Wo|men have Seam&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;hops; but Men are forbidden to come there under pain of a Forfeiture.

<P>Next to <HI>Bantam, Tuba,</HI> or <HI>Tuban,</HI> is the Chiefe&s;t Town in <HI>Java,</HI> and in effect is &s;tronger than all the re&s;t, and although not &s;o great as <HI>Bantam,</HI> 'tis at lea&s;t as hand&s;ome; and as well built. The Palace is exceeding &s;pacious, and hath very fair Apartments, where Ele|phants and other Bea&s;ts have their &s;eve|ral Quarters: each Elephant hath his Lodge built upon four Pillars, with a Po&s;t in the middle to tie him to. The

Rooms are filled with Che&s;ts, and Ham|pers for the Baggage, when the King goes His Progre&s;s. Near to his Lodg|ings is a place where his Game-Cocks are kept every one in his Pen apart, and every one his keeper; as likewi&s;e the Parrats, which are much before tho&s;e brought into the&s;e Parts, the greate&s;t part of a beautiful flame colour, with a great Golden &s;pot on the back: The out|&s;ide of their Wings blue and red, and the in-&s;ide a lovely Carnation. They are to endure the inconveniencies of a long Voyage: be&s;ides the <HI>Indians</HI> highly e|&s;teem them, for that they love their ow|ners, and delight to be made much of by them. The King of <HI>Tuban</HI> was much taken with all the&s;e Creatures, as al&s;o with Dogs, Hor&s;es, and white Ducks, much larger than ours. He had four legitimate Wives, Six Sons, and Two Daughters; be&s;ides Natural Children, a great number by Concubines, which he kept in &s;everal Apartments: His Bed was rai&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Ground, built like an Altar of Great Stones, whereon lay a Quilt, and certain Pillows of Satin, filled with raw Silk.</P>

They wear no other Garments than a Linnen Cloth about the Loyns; only Per&s;ons of the Fir&s;t Quality have &s;ometimes Hang&s;elines of Chamelet, which reach but to their Knees. They are by this Habit di&s;tingui&s;hed from others Per&s;ons, and by their Trains of Slaves, without whom they never come abroad. They delight much in Hor&s;es, and to have their Sad|dles exceeding Rich, which are made like our great Saddles; only their Trap|pings &s;tudded with Gold and Silver, &s;triving to appear well Mounted at A&s;&s;emblies, and to &s;hew the King their Hor&s;eman&s;hip, and the dexterity of their Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants that live in the inner part of the I&s;le of <HI>Java</HI> are <HI>Pagans,</HI> and the greate&s;t part <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> believing a Tran&s;migration of the Soul; for which rea&s;on they eat neither Fi&s;h nor Fle&s;h.

<P><HI>Lent</HI> being ended, they celebrate their <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> entertaining their Children and all their Dome&s;tics with a Dinner. There is &s;carce a Man in <HI>Bantam,</HI> who hath not three or four Wives, and &s;ome have ten or twelve, be&s;ides Concubines, who wait on their Wives, e&s;pecially when they go abroad: they make no difference between legitimate and natural Children: a Father hath not power to &s;ell his Child though he had it by a Slave. Children go &s;tark naked, only the Girls cover their Privities with a thin Plate of Gold and Silver: they marry at the AGe of Eight, Nine or Ten Years, not only to prevent the Di&s;orders, which in this hot Cli|mate

<P>The Women appear with great De|cency at the Marriage of their Relations, tho they u&s;e no great Ceremony. One may know the day by certain Poles, which are &s;tuck in the Hou&s;es of the Bride and Bridegroom, with Ta&s;&s;els of red and white Cotton.</P>
<P>Dinner ended, they bring a Hor&s;e to the Bridegroom, whereon he rides about the Town till Evening, expecting the Slaves he is to have in Marriage, who come commonly loaden with Pre&s;ents. None but the neare&s;t Kindred &s;up with them, and &s;ee the new Married Couple abed.</P>

They are &s;o much addict|ed to Cleanline&s;s, that there pa&s;&s;es not a day, but they bath them&s;elves three or four times. They never do their natural Nece&s;&s;ities, nor receive their Benevolen|ces from their Husbands, but they go up to the neck in Water to clean&s;e them|&s;elves: they do no work at all, which is no wonder; &s;ince the Husbands them|&s;elves having employed two or three Hours about their Merchandize, all the day after do nothing but chew <HI>Bettele</HI> among&s;t their Wives, who are very &s;ol|licitous,

<P>AMong the Creatures, which we &s;aid the Land of <HI>Bantam</HI> abounds withal, we mentioned Apes; and it is ob&s;ervable, that where there are a great number of the&s;e Animals, there are very few Crows; for a&s;&s;oon as they have built their Ne&s;ts, and laid their Eggs, the Apes get upon the Trees, and throw their Eggs to the ground: I do not know whether it be to &s;ee, if they can fly or no. As I was one day travelling along the Road in a Coach, attended with a

great many, we &s;aw a va&s;t number of Monkeys Males and Females, and many of the Females holding young ones in their Arms: Having a de&s;ire to &s;hoot at one, I took a Harquebu&s;s, and kill'd a Female Monkey, who lay &s;tretched out upon the Boughs, letting her little one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">all to the ground. But immediately all the Monkeys that were upon the Trees, to the number of &s;ixty, came down in a great fury to have leap'd into our Coach, where they would &s;oon have &s;trangled us, had we not prevented them by clo|&s;ing the Shutters; and had we not had a great number of Men, who with much ado kept them off; yet they pur&s;ued our Coach above a League, and were &s;tout lu&s;ty Monkeys. In &s;everal parts of this Country there are particular Ho&s;pitals for the&s;e Creatures. On the ways there are commonly Cop&s;es of <HI>Bamboos</HI> grow|ing very high; &s;ome of the&s;e are &s;o thick, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to get into 'em; but they are pe&s;tered with prodigious numbers of Apes. Tho&s;e that breed in the Cop&s;es upon one &s;ide of the way, are enemies to them that are bred on the other &s;ide; &s;o that they dare not cro&s;s from one &s;ide to the other, but they are in danger of being immediate|ly
<PB N="95" REF="51">
&s;trangled. Here the Travellers have good &s;port by &s;etting the Apes together by the ears, which is done after this man|ner; In &s;everal parts of the Road there is Rice to be &s;old, and they that would &s;ee the &s;port, cau&s;e five or &s;ix Baskets of Rice to be &s;et in the Road, &s;ome for|ty or fifty paces the one from the other, and clo&s;e by every Basket they lay five or &s;ix Botoons about two foot long, and two inches about; then they retire and hide them&s;elves: pre&s;ently they &s;hall &s;ee the Apes on both &s;ides of the way, de&s;cend from the tops of the <HI>Bamboos,</HI> and advance towards the Baskets which are full of Rice; They are about half an hour &s;hewing their Teeth at one ano|ther, before they come near the Baskets; &s;ometimes they advance, then retreat a|gain, being Ioath to encounter. At length the Female Baboons, who are more eager and couragious than the Males, e&s;pecially they that have young ones, which they carry in their Arms as Women do their Children, venture to approach the Ba&s;|kets; and as they are about to put in their hands to eat, the Males on the o|ther &s;ide advance to hinder 'em.

<PB N="96" REF="52">
on both &s;ides, they take up the Battoons, that lie by the Baskets, and thra&s;h one a|nother in good earne&s;t. The weake&s;t are con&s;trained to fly into the Woods with their Pates broken, and their Limbs maimed, while the Ma&s;ters of the Field glut them&s;elves with Rice, and the joys of Victory, tho it may be when their Bellies are full, they will &s;uffer &s;ome of the Female Party to come along with 'em.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Elephants,</HI> I happened to &s;ee two that were lately taken. Each of them was placed between two Tame ones. Round about the wild Elephants &s;tood &s;ix Men, with every one a Half Pike in their Hands, and a lighted Torch fa&s;tened at the end of a Pike; who talkt to the Bea&s;ts, giving them Meat, and crying out in their Language, <HI>Take, eat it.</HI> The food which they gave 'em was a little Bottle of Hay, &s;ome pieces of brown Sugar, and Rice boiled in Wa|ter, with &s;ome few Corns of Pepper. If the wild Elephants refu&s;ed to do as they were bidden, the Men made Signs to the Tame Elephant to beat 'em, which they did, banging the Refractory Ele|phant upon the Head and Forehead with their Trunks; and if he offered to make
<PB N="97" REF="52">
any &s;tir or re&s;i&s;tance, the other Elephant thwack'd him mo&s;t unmercifully on the other &s;ide; &s;o that the poor <HI>Elephant</HI> not knowing what to do, was con&s;trained to learn obedience.</P>
<P>Being thus fallen into the Story of <HI>Elephants,</HI> I will add &s;ome other Ob|&s;ervations, which I have made upon the nature of the&s;e Creatures. Though the <HI>Elephant</HI> never meddles with the Female after he is once taken, yet he is &s;ometimes &s;eized with a kind of lu&s;tful Rage. One day that the King was Hunting upon an <HI>Elephant,</HI> with one of his Sons that &s;ate by him to fan him, the <HI>Elephant</HI> became &s;o furious by rea&s;on of his Lu&s;t, that the <HI>Governour</HI> who was by no means able to ma&s;ter or rule him, declared to the King, that to allay the fury of the <HI>Elephant&punc;</HI> who would doubtle&s;s brui&s;e him to pie|ces among the Trees, there was no way but for one of the three to forfeit his Life, and that he would willingly &s;acri|fice his for the &s;afety of the King, and the Prince his Son; only he de&s;ir'd His Maje&s;ty to take care of the three &s;mall Children which he mu&s;t leave behind him. Having &s;o &s;aid, he threw him&s;elf under the <HI>Elephants</HI> Feet, who had no &s;ooner taken him in his Trunk, and
<PB N="98" REF="53">
&s;queez'd him to pieces with his feet, but he grew quiet and peaceable as before. The King as an acknowledgment of &s;o &s;ignal a deliverance, gave to the poor Widow 200000 <HI>Roopies,</HI> and highly advanc'd every one of his Sons, that had &s;o generou&s;ly laid down his life for the &s;afety of the Father of his Country.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved al&s;o, that tho the <HI>Elephants</HI> skin be very hard whil&s;t he is alive, yet when he is dead the skin is ju&s;t like melt|ed Glew.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Parks that are em|paled with nothing but <HI>Elephants</HI> Teeth, the lea&s;t of which Parks is above a League about.

When they intend to take their <HI>Ele|phants,</HI> they make a long Lane clos'd in on both &s;ides, &s;o as the <HI>Elephant</HI> can run neither to the right nor to the left. This Lane is broad at the fir&s;t, but grows narrower and narrower, till there is no more Room left at the further end, than for the Female <HI>Elephant</HI> to lie down, which mu&s;t be one that is de&s;irous of the Male at the &s;ame time.

Now when the <HI>Elephant</HI> comes where the Lane grows narrow, they that lie hid for that purpo&s;e, imme|diately barricado up the Lane behind; and when he comes near the Female, then is another barricado &s;et up, that &s;tops him from going any further. When he is thus between the Barricadoes, they &s;o entangle his Legs and Trunk with Ropes and Cords, that he is &s;oon taken, hav|ing no way to help him&s;elf. The &s;ame way they u&s;e for the mo&s;t part in the Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Pegu;</HI> onely that the Natives there mount the Female <HI>Elephant,</HI> and go to find out the Male in the Fore&s;ts; and when they have met with his haunt, they tie the Female to the mo&s;t convenient place they can find, and then they fix their Snares for the <HI>Ele|phant,</HI> who in a &s;hort time ha&s;tens to|wards the Female hot for generation, where her Cries call him.</P>
<P>This is ob&s;ervable of the Female, that when &s;he begins to be hot, &s;he gathers together a great heap of Herbs and Weeds, and makes her &s;elf a kind of Bed &s;ome four or five foot high from the ground, where contrary to the Cu&s;tom

<P>This is furthermore particular to the <HI>Elephant</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> that only the fir&s;t, which the Female brings forth has Tu&s;hes.

<P>When the Merchants bring <HI>Elephants</HI> to any place to &s;ell, 'tis a plea&s;ant &s;ight to &s;ee 'em go along; for in regard there are generally old and young together, when the old ones are gone by, the Chil|dren will be running after the little ones to play with 'em, and give 'em &s;ome|thing or other to eat.

<P>Very plea&s;ant and fruitful is this Country, being watered with &s;everal great Rivers, the principal of which is called <HI>Menan,</HI> which after having Bathed <HI>Prom, Travai,</HI> and <HI>Brema,</HI> Cities of <HI>Ava</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> enters into that of <HI>Siam,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thorough <HI>India</HI> the Capital thereof. This River is &s;o deep, that it can carry Ships of four Hundred Tun, and which take Twelve or Thirteen Foot Water; and it might bear tho&s;e that draw as much more, were it not that at its mouth there is a Rock, which fills the bottom near which you are to pa&s;s, and hinders great|er Ve&s;&s;els from coming in. Its breadth near the City, and for two Leagues be|yond it, is two Bow-&s;hoot, which renders the unlading of Commodities &s;o much the more ea&s;ie. Every where el&s;e its Banks are a good Mu&s;quet &s;hot di&s;tance one from another.

<P>Eight Leagues from the City &s;tands another called <HI>Bancock,</HI> where all man|ner of Ships, of what Nation &s;oever they be, are obliged to &s;top to declare from whence they come, whither they go, what is their <HI>Cargo?</HI> and how ma|ny Men they have on Board? after which they pay the Cu&s;toms, for which the Toll-man gives an Acquittance, which they are obliged to &s;hew to ano|ther little City, called <HI>Canon Bantenau,</HI> which is but a League from <HI>India;</HI> and in ca&s;e it be without deceit, they are permitted to go whither they plea&s;e, and to trade freely through all the King|doms, without being obliged to pay any other Cu&s;toms than tho&s;e of going out, which every Ship is to pay upon pain of Confi&s;cation.

<P>The Air is very temperate, con&s;idering its being &s;o near the Line, (for it is but fifteen degrees di&s;tant) perhaps by rea|&s;on of the narrowne&s;s of the Country, which is refre&s;hed by Winds.

breeds a great number of <HI>Elephants</HI> and Hor&s;es. There are great Fore&s;ts towards <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> which &s;erve for retreats to Tygers, Lions, Leopards, and other ra|venous Bea&s;ts, and for Veni&s;on; but the number of Red and Fallow Deer is in|credible, &s;ince that there is carried eve|ry Year to <HI>Japan,</HI> above Three Hundred Thou&s;and Skins of tho&s;e Creatures, wherein the Company have a good &s;hare.

There is no Court more <HI>&s;uperb</HI> than that of this Emperour.

When one of the&s;e great Men is de&s;irous to &s;peak to him, he approaches him with his Knees upon the ground, his Hands joyned, his Head bowed down, and begins and ends his Speech with the&s;e words, <HI>Javva Fiauw Perre Bonde, Tiauw Javva;</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> His Throne, which is of Ma&s;&s;ie Gold, and all be&s;t with Precious Stones, is rai&s;ed very high from the ground; he mounts it by &s;e|veral &s;teps of the &s;ame Metal, but 'tis a Crime to &s;ee him mount it, and every &s;tep at both ends &s;upports an <HI>Animal</HI> of different kind, and of fine Gold. When he goes out of His Palace, whether out of Devotion&punc; or for Plea&s;ure, which hap|pens two or three times in the Year, he is attended by the greate&s;t Princes of His

Empire, by His Wives and Concubines, who are in great numbers all very rich|ly clothed, by Land upon <HI>Elephants,</HI> and by Water in Barges all guilt without and within. From the Palace to the place where the Emperour goes, the Life-Guard &s;tands in a row on each &s;ide, all well apparelled and mounted to advantage; principally the chief Officers, who are upon <HI>Elephants,</HI> who&s;e Hou&s;es are of Gold and Silver. All along the way nothing is to be heard but Fifes, Drums, Flutes, and other In&s;truments, which make a pa&s;&s;able Harmony. And a&s;&s;oon as the Emperour appears, every one upon pain of Death is obliged to come out before him, pro&s;trate 'em&s;elves, and adore him: wherein they are &s;o rigorous, that if one waits never &s;o little to acquit him&s;elf of this <HI>Devoir,</HI> he is puni&s;hed at that in&s;tant, which I have &s;een with my own eyes. This Cu&s;tom is quite contrary to what is practi&s;ed in <HI>Peru;</HI> for in all places where the King goes with his Wives and Con|cubines, the People mu&s;t &s;hut their Doors and Windows, and remain as in Pri&s;on until all is gone by.

It was upon the account of the&s;e Ani|mals, that in the Year 1548, the Kings of <HI>Ava</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> made a League again&s;t the Emperour of <HI>Siam,</HI> in who&s;e Terri|tories they had made a great Progre&s;s, before he was in a condition to re&s;i&s;t 'em.

What at fir&s;t delayed his March, was, that he had neither Souldiers nor Ships to go to the place, where he was to joyn the Enemy; and he cau&s;ed above Twen|ty Thou&s;and Ve&s;&s;els to be built, which required &s;ome time. Be&s;ides the two

Hundred Thou&s;and Men which he brought with him, he left upon the Fron|tiers Fifty Thou&s;and Citizens, who were obliged to guard 'em at their own co&s;ts.

<P>THE great number of Strangers, who trade at <HI>Siam,</HI> help much to in|crea&s;e the Trea&s;ures of the King; there is continually a coming in and going out of His Kingdom, a prodigious quan|tity of Merchandizes, on which there are con&s;iderable Impo&s;ts.

From that &s;oft and tractable Humour, they ea|&s;ily proceed to Devotion, which is as na|tural to 'em; and whether they are little addicted to Riches, whereof they have only the u&s;e, and not the Proper|ty, or they think 'em unworthy of their Affection, they employ 'em almo&s;t all in Alms, which they be&s;tow upon the <HI>Bonzes,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re the Prie&s;ts of the Coun|try, and in building Pagods and Con|vents, to which they annex &s;o many Revenues, as no Monks live more at their ea&s;e, nor know better, how to take ad|vantage of the u&s;eful Ignorance and Su|per&s;tition of the People, than the Monks of that Country. The great e&s;teem the People have for 'em, cau&s;es 'em to mul|tiply more than can be imagined; the&s;e Prie&s;ts affect a fine out-&s;ide, and a mo|de&s;ty which &s;avours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of nothing le&s;s than of Ambition.

<P>The&s;e good People are clothed in yel|low, and every New Moon they have their Heads, Beards and Eye brows &s;ha|ved.

The great Mode&s;ty which they affect in their Pious Exerci&s;es, does in|vite to their Hou&s;es all the People, who in acknowledgment of the &s;piritual Be|nefits which the Monks communicate to 'em, be&s;tow upon 'em &s;uch as are tem|poral, and that even to profu&s;ion. A|bout four a clock in the Morning, they ri&s;e at the ringing of the Bells, and go all together to a certain place appointed for Prayer; part of the day is &s;pent in vi&s;it|ing the &s;ick; in the Evening they return to Prayers, where they remember the dead, for they believe that their Pray|ers contribute very much towards their comfort and ea&s;e, and for the freeing 'em from an imaginary Place, where (they &s;ay) they endure great Pains.</P>
<P>They have an infinite number of Idols, who repre&s;ent &s;everal po&s;tures of Men and Women, mo&s;t being of Gold or Sil|ver, &s;ome of Copper and Pewter, and very few of Stone or Wood. In the great Pagod, where the King goes once a year, there is one, who tho &s;eated with

The Works of <HI>Supererogation</HI> are in great Credit among&s;t 'em; and if we would believe 'em, there is not a dead Per&s;on, but whom their Prayers are a great help to, nor any living, but to whom they are con&s;iderably u&s;eful.

<P>NOthing is wanting in that King|dom of things nece&s;&s;ary for the Structure of all &s;orts of Buildings, e&s;pe|cially it abounds in very fine Stones, and yet the Hou&s;es there are only of Wood:
<PB N="123" REF="65">
the rea&s;on of it is, that the Stones are re&s;erved for the building both the <HI>Pagods</HI> and <HI>Pyramids,</HI> whereof there is a prodi|gious number through all the Country, Stools, Chairs and Tables are of no u&s;e there, and the <HI>Siamites</HI> as well as all the other <HI>Orientals,</HI> &s;it in all occa&s;ions, only upon Mats or Carpets. All their Move|ables, which con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome Uten&s;ils of the Kitchin, are of Bra&s;s, always very bright and very neat; their Hou&s;es are &s;o clean and neat, that they far exceed <HI>Holland</HI> in that; and as for their Per|&s;ons, they wa&s;h their Bodies three times a day from Head to Foot, in the cleare&s;t Fountain water that can be found; then they rub 'em&s;elves with a Perfume com|po&s;ed of Sandal Wood, Aloes, Amber|greece, Ro&s;e-Water, Musk, and &s;uch like things, who&s;e Odour is very agreeable; wherein they take a much better cour&s;e than the <HI>Javans,</HI> who perfume 'em&s;elves with a Drug that is in&s;upportable to tho&s;e that are nice in the lea&s;t. Com|monly it is forthwith after tho&s;e Bath|ings, that they make their Vi&s;its and their Devotions, but they fir&s;t deck 'em|&s;elves with all their fineries; tho&s;e of the Men con&s;i&s;ting in a number of Gold-Rings, and a long Ve&s;t of Cotton-&s;tuff,
<PB N="124" REF="66">
upon which they have a Sa&s;h of &s;everal colours, and under, a very loo&s;e &s;hirt of Linnen or Cotton, which is &s;ometimes red, &s;ometimes white, or of another co|lour. The Sleeves of their Ve&s;ts are very large, mo&s;t of 'em open about the Elbow, and hanging to the Knees, but they go almo&s;t bare-headed, and without &s;hooes.</P>
<P>The Women make a round of their Hair, which they fa&s;ten behind their Head with a Bodkin. Their Pendants are of blades of Gold, of a Fingers length, which are incha&s;ed with &s;ome Jewels; tho&s;e blades are &s;o ma&s;&s;ie, that the weight of them makes holes in their Ears big enough to put a Thumb through. Their Bracelets are likewi&s;e of Gold and Preci|ous Stones, and they have very fine Dia|monds upon their Fingers. As for their Habits, they are of Cotton, as well as tho&s;e of the Men, and made much after the &s;ame manner; except that they have upon their Bo&s;oms a Veil of Linnen or Silk, the colour of which is Arbitrary, and the form &s;omething re&s;embles the Scarfs Women wear in <HI>England.</HI> The Complexion of both Sexes is Tawny; they are Tall of Stature, but well &s;et, and of a Free Carriage, and general|ly

<P>Tho the young Men and Maids &s;ee one another with liberty enough, and it is no Scandal for the latter to grant &s;ometimes Favours, they live in Marriage with &s;o much re&s;ervedne&s;s, that there is no Na|tion where the Women have more: Not that they are all perhaps &s;o many <HI>Lu|cretiaes,</HI> but as Adultery is there &s;evere|ly puni&s;hed, the fear of Puni&s;hment is capable of rendring 'em di&s;creet. More|over, the Mothers forbid their Daugh|ters when they are young, too great a Commerce with Men, for fear <HI>of getting an ill Habit;</HI> or perhaps too, for fear that the Men &s;hould not be &s;o eager to court 'em by way of Marriage. This Circum|&s;tance makes the Maids, who have a de|&s;ire to be Married, of difficult acce&s;s; and the more they conceal 'em&s;elves, the more do their Lovers crowd after 'em. The means to obtain 'em is, to addre&s;s ones &s;elf to the Parents, who, without con&s;ulting their Daughters Inclinations, grant her to the Man, who plea&s;es 'em mo&s;t, provided he be of the Kindred; for it is the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Siamites,</HI> to ally 'em&s;elves only in their own Family, where all Alliance is permitted, except
<PB N="126" REF="67">
between Brother and Si&s;ter; nay, and the&s;e may Marry together, in ca&s;e they be but Half-Brothers and Half-Si&s;ters; that is to &s;ay, of the &s;ame Father, and not of the &s;ame Mother. Thus Intrigues of Gallantry are of no u&s;e in that Coun|try, and &s;uch an one Marries, who has never &s;een the Per&s;on &s;he is to wed. As Intere&s;t reigns there as well as el&s;e|where, they make Alliances commonly in con&s;ideration of E&s;tate and Fortune; and when the Match is advantageous, for fear of a di&s;appointment, the Maids are Married at Nine years, and the Young Men at Twelve; in&s;omuch as the married Couple do not both make five and twen|ty years, when they find 'em&s;elves alrea|dy Fathers and Mothers. Out of Marriage the Men are permitted to have as many Concubines as they can maintain, and in Marriage, if they have but one Wife, they are free to quit her upon &s;light pre|texts, e&s;pecially when they have no Children, and then either the one or the other may Marry again when they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho the Prie&s;ts are very much reve|renced in that Country, yet there is no re&s;pect had to 'em in Marriage, and far from calling 'em to be Witne&s;&s;es of the

He who performs the Ceremony of it, is one of the neare&s;t Relations, who in the heat of the Fea&s;t, makes an Exhortation, after his mode, to the new married Cou|ple: and whether the Bride and Bride|groom live together until death, or they part, the Clau&s;es of the Contract of Mar|riage are religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>As to the Children, they are brought up with great gentlene&s;s, and yet they are very &s;upple, and do punctually, without any need of u&s;ing rigour, all that is exacted from them. 'Tis u&s;ually the Prie&s;ts, who take care of their Education; and as this &s;ort of People live happily, their Di&s;ciples ob&s;erving it, turn Prie&s;ts as well as they, for to enjoy the &s;ame plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Their Cu&s;tom in regard of the Dead, is to burn them, and to make their Fu|nerals conformably to their Means, which is performed in the manner following; The Relations of the Defunct rai&s;e up a Tomb, which they fill with &s;weet &s;cented Wood, which &s;erves to burn the Corps, and whereto the Prie&s;ts &s;et fire, after having &s;aid Prayers.

Rich pre&s;erve the A&s;hes in Urns of Gold or Silver, or bury 'em under a Pyramid, or in a Pagod, which the Decea&s;ed has cau&s;ed to be built; for there is not a rich <HI>Siamite,</HI> but who is at that expence to eternize his Memory. The A&s;hes of the Poor are ca&s;t into the Wind.

As for Criminals and Children, who end their Lives, tho&s;e by a Criminal, the&s;e by an untimely death, their bodies are not burnt, but they inter 'em, it not being rea&s;onable, that they who have lived without honour, or died before they attained to the Knowledge of Re|ligion and the Gods, &s;hould enjoy the Honours and Priviledges of the Coun|try.</P>
<P>The Civility of the <HI>Siamites</HI> extends even to Strangers, and of what Nation &s;oever a Man be, he is favourably re|ceived there. What contributes to this good Reception is, that the more Stran|gers there be there, the more are the Na|tives

<P>Preparations were made for that Pomp in one of the Courts of that Palace, where there were rai&s;ed five Towers of Wood; whereof that in the mid&s;t was about an Hundred and twenty Foot in Height, the others dimini&s;hing by the &s;ame degrees they &s;tood at a di&s;tance from that. Tho&s;e Towers were painted and gilt, and had communication by Galleries, with Bal|li&s;ters enriched with the &s;ame Ornaments.

Stones; &s;he was &s;tanding, her Hands joyned, her Face turn'd towards Heaven, in a Coffin of Gold an inch thick. Her Robe had a long Train, and was all be&s;et with Jewels; her Crown, her Neck|lace, and her Bracelets likewi&s;e, all over covered with Diamonds, were of an in|e&s;timable price. When every one had taken places upon Scaffolds made on purpo&s;e, all the <HI>Grandees</HI> of the Kingdom went to make their Bows to her. The Ladies came thither afterwards, and both Sexes were only apparell'd with a white Cloth, without any Attire or Ornament; each one &s;cattering round the Body and the Altar Flowers and Perfumes, with a very &s;ad Countenance. After which, the Body was carried twenty paces from thence in a Chariot, the riches whereof equalled that of the Altar. The Poten|tates of the Kingdom, and the Ladies, having paid her the &s;ame Honours, they all wept bitterly, and after &s;o mournful a manner&punc; that it &s;eemed as if they had lo&s;t what they had deare&s;t in the world. The&s;e Tears and Lamentations having la&s;ted for half an hour, the Principal Officers of the Crown drew the Chari|ot very gently towards the place where the Funeral Pile was. It was attended

Round the Bed, walk|ed fourteen of the Kings Sons on foot, clothed al&s;o in white, with a branch of a Tree in their Hands, all &s;o well in|&s;tructed in weeping, that there was not one in the Company but did it with a good grace. At half way from the Fu|neral Pile, there were Stages or Scaffolds, where the Lords of le&s;&s;er Quality than the former, expected the Convoy.

<P>Whil&s;t the Ladies were weeping round the decea&s;ed Prince&s;s, the Prie&s;ts were upon Scaffolds in the Court where the fir&s;t Tears were &s;hed, praying Night and day for her Soul: And while the Body was expo&s;ed there, they interrup|ted their Prayers often, for to ca&s;t to the People Garments of all &s;orts, Uten&s;ils for Hou&s;e-keeping, In&s;truments for Artificers, Beds, Mats, and other Moveables.

When they thought the Body con&s;umed, and went to gather up the A&s;hes for the putting 'em into an Urn of Gold, there was found a piece of fle&s;h of the bigne&s;s of a little Child, &s;o fine, and &s;o Vermilion-like, that it &s;eemed at fir&s;t, as if the Fire had &s;pared it out of re&s;pect; but that thought was followed by another, which occa&s;ioned the &s;hedding of a great deal of bloud.

That Nati|on paid formerly to the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t India</HI> Company a certain Impo&s;t for the fi&s;hing of this Fi&s;h, but that Right does no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Its Soil is very fruitful, but the Inha|bitants (who are la&s;ie) do not make the be&s;t advantage on't. It produces Rice, Wheat, Barley, Millet, Ginger, Cinamon, Coco's, Lemons, Oranges, Melons, Gourds, and all &s;orts of Pul&s;e, <HI>Majavinades, Gui|gavas, Cadiany, Potates;</HI> and the <HI>Focu|focoes,</HI> which is a Fruit of the form and

bigne&s;s of a <HI>Bon Chre&s;tien</HI> Pear. This Fruit is of a Purple colour, and lies up|on the ground as Melons do, and is of a mo&s;t excellent ta&s;te. There are likewi&s;e &s;ome Sheep, but not &s;o many as Deer, Goats, Hares, Rabbets, Pidgeons, Fal|low Deer, wild Goats, wild Boars, Ty|gers, Bears and Monkeys; be&s;ides a cer|tain Animal, called by the <HI>Hollanders, the Devil of Fayovan;</HI> it is about three quarters of a yard in length, and about twenty Inches large; it has Scales like a Fi&s;h, and very &s;harp Claws. It only feeds upon Pi&s;mires, who go of them&s;elves upon its Tongue, when Hunger pre&s;&s;es it to put it out. This Creature is very timorous, and e&s;pecially of Mankind: if it can only &s;hun one by hiding it &s;elf in the Earth, it makes a hole there|in with &s;o much ardour, that in a mo|ment it retrenches it &s;elf as in a Fort; or if it be &s;urpri&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, as that it has not time to get in, it wraps its &s;elf up in its Scales, and takes the form of a Ball. Tho&s;e who have named it <HI>Devil,</HI> mu&s;t needs not have known it, or they were frighted with its Figure; for tho you hurt it never &s;o much, it will rather &s;uffer it &s;elf to be killed than make any Defence. There are no Parrots, but

many other &s;orts of Birds, and an infinity of flying Locu&s;ts that are very dangerous and trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Men are of a low &s;tature, particu|larly tho&s;e who inhabit the Mountains; neither are the Women of a larger &s;ize, mo&s;t of whom have broad Faces, great Eyes, flat No&s;es, and full bo&s;omed; and what they have mo&s;t &s;ingular is, that they have Beards grow upon their Chins as well as Men; and were they not very diligent in pulling it out, they would be much better furni&s;hed. Add to this beauty very long Ears, which they take great care to lengthen and augment by the weight of certain great Shells, which &s;erve 'em in&s;tead of Pen|dants. This Ornament &s;eems to 'em &s;o rare, that the more Solemn the Fea&s;ts are, and of the greater quality the Peo|ple they &s;ee, the more they lengthen their Ears, which reach, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, down to their very Brea&s;ts, by the coun|ter weights which they put in 'em. Their Hair is both very black and long; &s;ome wear it much after the &s;ame manner as they do in <HI>Holland;</HI> others tye it up af|ter the <HI>Chineze</HI> manner, or make it into &s;everal Tre&s;&s;es, which they fa&s;ten round behind their Heads with a Tin Bodkin.

Their Necklaces are of Gla&s;s or Stone, and of little pieces of Silver in &s;everal Figures. Their Complexion is yellow and black, and &s;ome towards <HI>Kubeland</HI> are yellow and white.

As for the Gifts of Mind, all the Inhabitants in general are pretty well furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Women are cloathed from the Neck to the Middle with a piece of Cot|ton, which flys about negligently; and from the Middle to the Knees with ano|ther piece of Cotton. Their Head-geer is of &s;ome Silk &s;tuff, or mo&s;t commonly of Velvet, whereof they make two points, which advance on either &s;ide the Fore|head: They go always bare-footed, and are almo&s;t ever followed by an Hog, who is as familiar to them as the Dog is in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>The Men paint their Brea&s;ts, Backs, and Arms, with a juyce of Herbs, which is ne|ver worn out: they have Bracelets of Gla&s;s and Necklaces of the &s;ame, and they have &s;uch &s;treight Sleeves of Iron upon their Arms, that they can hardly move 'em; as for their Legs, they deck 'em with rows of white Shells very neat|ly wrought.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Tocadeol</HI> take for a Sumptuous Ornament (for they only deck them&s;elves with it on Holy-days) a long Reed or Cane of a yard and a quarter in length, the one end of which,

is fa&s;tened upon the Reins, the other bends over the Head, to which, is tyed a floating knot of red and white &s;tuff, of almo&s;t half a yard long, and &s;even or eight Inches broad. They have more|over a Crown of Cocks Feathers, and the Tails of Bares upon their Arms and Legs. Their Beds are as extraordinary as the re&s;t, two Stags Skins &s;erving 'em for Quilts, Sheets and Blankets: the&s;e Beds &s;eem &s;o delicate to 'em, that they are loath to leave 'em; and when that hap|pens, which they do the late&s;t they can, 'tis with no de&s;ign to go to work, for they are neither Shoo-makers, Weavers nor Joyners. In a word, they make Profe&s;&s;ion of having no need of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Trades: or rather, they know 'em all, every one being capable of do|ing what he has occa&s;ion for: their par|ticular Dexterity lies in handling the Bow; and whether running, lying, &s;tand|ing, or &s;itting, they never fail of hitting the Mark they aim at, provided it be vi&s;ible. They are al&s;o excellent Swim|mers, but e&s;pecially they run with an incredible Swiftne&s;s, and when they un|dertake it, there is not a Hor&s;e that can outgo 'em; they have, while they are running, a piece of Iron of a round Fi|gure,

&s;ix Inches long, and five Inches broad; they &s;trike with tho&s;e In&s;tru|ments upon the Bracelets or Sleeves of Iron we have mentioned, to animate one another, according to the need they have thereof, making more ha&s;te, or making the le&s;s &s;peed, according to the number of the blows they give. Na|vigation is an Art which they do not under&s;tand; and all they know in point of <HI>Water</HI> is to cro&s;s a River in the hollow of a Trunk of a Tree: but tho they are ignorant of what is the delight of mo&s;t other Nations, yet they live ve|ry happily, fi&s;hing and hunting furni&s;h|ing 'em abundantly wherewith to live; and if they have an occa&s;ion or de&s;ire of &s;omething el&s;e, their Women have &s;o natural an Inclination to Agriculture, that they find means, without the help of o|ther living Creatures, to di&s;po&s;e the Earth, to produce 'em what they &s;ow there. They make War after the &s;ame manner, that Savage and Brutal Nations do, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> without Art and Or|der; and what is therein mo&s;t inhu|mane, without Quarter too: for, tho&s;e to whom Hazard gives the advantage, never give Quarter to their Enemies, for fear they &s;hould be taken with a de|&s;ire

<P>Before I had &s;een this I&s;land, I had of|ten heard &s;ay, there were Men with long Tails like Bea&s;ts, but I could never be|lieve it, and I thought the thing &s;o far from our Nature, that I could hardly give credit to my Eyes, when they took away all doubts by an Adventure &s;ome|what odd. The Inhabitants of <HI>Formo|&s;a</HI> being accu&s;tomed to &s;ee us, we &s;aw one another with &s;o much confidence, as not to be afraid of any ill accident on either &s;ide. So that tho Foreiners, we belie|ved our &s;elves in &s;afety, and went of|ten abroad without a Guard, when Ex|perience made us know that we hazard|ed our &s;elves too far. One day &s;ome of our People walking together, one of our Mini&s;ters being of the Company, went a Stones Ca&s;t from 'em upon &s;ome Natural Occa&s;ions, the others in the mean while walked &s;till on, very attentive to a &s;tory that was told 'em. When it was ended, they remembred the Mini&s;ter did not re|turn, and waited for him &s;ome time:

after which, being weary of waiting, they went towards the place where they expected he was; they found him, but without life, and the &s;ad condition he was in, gave &s;ufficiently to under&s;tand that he had not langui&s;hed long. While &s;ome kept him, others went on &s;everal &s;ides for to di&s;cover the Murderers: they went not far without finding a man&punc; who &s;eeing him&s;elf inclo&s;ed by ours, foamed, howled, and made 'em comprehend, that he would make him repent who &s;hould fir&s;t approach him. His de&s;perate Car|riage made at fir&s;t &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, but at length their fears cea&s;ed, they took that mi&s;erable Wretch, who confe&s;&s;ed, that he killed the Mini&s;ter, but they could not learn for what rea&s;on. As it was a heinous crime, and that impunity might have ill con&s;equences, they condemned him to be burnt. He was tied to a Po&s;t, where he remained for &s;ome hours before the Execution. It was then that I &s;aw what hitherto I had not been able to believe; his Tail was above a foot long, all covered with red hair, and very like to that of an Ox. When he &s;aw that the Spectators were much &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee in him what they had not them&s;elves, he told 'em&punc; that that defect,

The Magazine which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have in that City, is &s;ituated in a little I&s;le, &s;e|parated from the City by a River of a|bout forty foot broad. The Ramparts of that I&s;land are of Planks of a foot and a half thick; the Bridge of Communi|cation is an Hundred and fifty foot long, and fifty broad. At the end of the Bridge they enter into the Magazine, in the mid&s;t whereof is the Hou&s;e of the chief or principal Officer of the Company.

There is round the Ma|gazine a number of Hou&s;es, which form Streets of a good hand&s;ome largene&s;s, where there are convenient places for the Inhabitants of that little City.

There were tho&s;e of our Ships Crew, who without being much concerned for what might happen, gave their hearts up to joy, and drank &s;o largely thereof, that they &s;et up the Flag, round which they &s;ung, danced, and to which they preten|ded likewi&s;e to &s;hew a Comedy, when a Hurricane came, and broke all their Mea&s;ures; it came with &s;o much fury, that we had hardly time to get into the Hold, than the Ma&s;ts, Sail-yards, Main|yards, all were broke like Gla&s;s, and ca&s;t very far into the Sea.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of mo&s;t remark was the Fotique at <HI>Fencheday,</HI> where, if Fame &s;peak truth, the Devil oft times made an Apparition.

A|mong&s;t other Sacrifices or Forms of Wor|&s;hip, one was, that a Damo&s;el every New Moon was by the <HI>Bonzes</HI> brought into the Temple and placed right again&s;t the Idol. The Room was forthwith illu|minated by a preparation of <HI>Lignum vitae</HI> with other co&s;tly Perfumes, put into a Lamp of Gold; after a &s;mall &s;pace, the Lights (as it were by a Miracle) extin|gui&s;h, and then in gro&s;s darkne&s;s, the <HI>Pha&s;ma</HI> having a&s;&s;umed a Bodily &s;hape, or other fal&s;e repre&s;entation accompa|nies her, at lea&s;t, as &s;he imagines, and the rather, becau&s;e certain Scales like tho&s;e of Fi&s;hes are left behind as an argument to per&s;wade it was no Phanta&s;m.

One Temple is dedicated to a Lizard, which they make the Author and Patron of Learning without Altar or Image in it.

Their bui&s;y Wits appears by their que&s;tions to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> of the Nature of the Soul, of Angels and Devils, &amp;c. And &s;ome of 'em &s;eeing the ab&s;urdities of the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> wor&s;hip nothing at all. The <HI>Bonzii,</HI> as the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> report, rai&s;ed &s;landerous Rumours of 'em, to be eaters of Mans Fle&s;h, and cau&s;es of the Wars and Plagues, which their Gods, provo|ked by this new Sect, &s;ent among 'em: they &s;landered the new Converts as mi|&s;erable Apo&s;tates, which became <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> becau&s;e they would not be at the Charges of their Idolatry.
