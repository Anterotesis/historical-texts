<HEAD><HI>Sect.</HI> I. <HI>The Accidents that fell out in our Voyage,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE departed from <HI>London</HI> Thur&s;day <HI>January 16th.</HI> 1690. about Nine in the Morning, and came that Night to <HI>Cittingbourn;</HI> the next Day, about Noon, we came to <HI>Margaret,</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet;</HI> and the &s;ame Evening we went on Board the Frigat that car|ried His Maje&s;ty's Mu&s;ick, which lay then in
<PB N="6" REF="4">
the Road, with the re&s;t of the Fleet, Comman|ded by Admiral <HI>Rooke:</HI> Early the next morning, being <HI>Saturday</HI> the 17th. the King Arriv'd from <HI>Graves-end,</HI> attended by the Dukes of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Portland,</HI> and other Grandees of the Court: About Noon, the Signal being given from the Admiral, the whole Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of Twelve <HI>Men of War,</HI> Seven <HI>Yatchs,</HI> and many Tenders, &s;et Sail, with a fair Gale. On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 20th, We came in &s;ight of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> near the I&s;land of <HI>Goree,</HI> but the weather being dark|ned with Foggs, and the Shore choak'd up with heaps of Ice, pil'd up one upon another, it was not for us to come near: However the King put him&s;elf into a <HI>Shallop</HI> to get to the Land, notwith&s;tanding the danger that threatned him; and when all the re&s;t were terrified with the Perils wherein His Maje&s;ty ventur'd his Per&s;on; and the Seamen them&s;elves were not in a little Terror, it was ob&s;erv'd; that He him&s;elf, was the only Per&s;on, nothing at all di&s;may'd. In the mean time the Foggs grew thicker and thic|ker, in&s;omuch, that we who were in the Man of War, &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the <HI>Shallop,</HI> where the King was; and Night coming on, His Ma|je&s;ty was for Ten hours expos'd to all the Inju|ries of the Air, and the Waves of the Sea, which fometimes came into the <HI>Shallop;</HI> &s;o that the Lords who were with him, had their Cloaths all covered with Ice: However the next morn|ing His Maje&s;ty Landed in the I&s;land <HI>Goree,</HI> and went into a Country Man's hou&s;e, which had
<PB N="7" REF="4">
no more room to receive Him, and all the Lords of his Train, than one mi&s;erable Chamber and a Kitchin; But it was a welcome Retreat after &s;o great a Hazard. After the King had &s;hifted his Linnen and his Cloaths, and had been Com|plemented by the Magi&s;trate of the I&s;land, who offered him his Hou&s;e, which His Maje&s;ty re|fu&s;ed, He took Coach again in the &s;ame Coach that brought him to the Country Mans Hou&s;e, and went aboard the <HI>Shallop</HI> again, to Land up|on the firm Continent; But then he met with new difficulties, for the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el could not get near the Shore for the Ice; &s;o that two Seamen were forced to take the King in their Arms, and carry him to the <HI>Shallop:</HI> At la&s;t His Maje&s;ty, with our whole Fleet of Tenders, (the Men of War returning for <HI>England)</HI> Ar|riv'd at a place called <HI>Orangie Poldar;</HI> here His Maje&s;ty was Complemented by the Prince of <HI>Na&s;&s;au Sarbrach,</HI> Camp-Mar&s;hall, the Count of <HI>Berka,</HI> the Emperors extraordinary Envoy, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Catonna,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> the Deputies of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Frizeland,</HI> Count <HI>Horn;</HI> and &s;everal other Per|&s;ons of the Highe&s;t Quality, who attended him to <HI>Hou&s;laerdike,</HI> where he repo&s;ed him&s;elf for &s;ome hours. 'Twas thought His Maje&s;ty would have continu'd here for &s;ome Days, till all things were ready for the Magnificent En|try they were re&s;olv'd to make for Him. But he told them, he de&s;ired none of tho&s;e Honours, well knowing that the Glory of a Prince does not con&s;i&s;t in Appearing, but in Acting. The
<PB N="8" REF="5">
King therefore went the &s;ame day to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and Arriv'd there about Six in the Evening, Accompanied with the Lords already mention|ed, and &s;urrounded with the Guards of the Body. And in regard the Kings coming was in a manner a kind of &s;urprize, his Entrance was al&s;o without any Ceremony. So that all that could be done in Te&s;timony of the pub|lick Joy, was only by &s;ome Peals of Cannon, and Ringing the Bells.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the <HI>Burge&s;&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Hague</HI> had prepared along time before for His Maje&s;ty's Publick Entry, and had been at con&s;iderable Charges to make a Glorious Appearance; and all the Towns adjoyning, had prepared to be pre&s;ent at the Solemnity. In a Word, all the <HI>Holl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">nders</HI> were willing to &s;ee the King in Pub|lick, and to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, with their own Eye, that a Prince, whom they love &s;o infinite|ly, and of whom the common Enemy had &s;pread &s;o many fal&s;e Reports, was &s;till alive, and returned into their Provinces, which obli|ged the States to entreat his Maje&s;ty to make a Publick Entry; which he refu&s;ed a long time, that &s;uch Ceremonies were but the lo&s;s of that time which he had re&s;olved to &s;pend altogether in Action. At length all that they could obtain from the King was, that he would dine about a quarter of a League from the <HI>Hague,</HI> at a Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Portlands,</HI> and re|turn in his Coach through the mid&s;t of the <HI>Burge&s;&s;es,</HI> ranged in Files, from the Court to the end of the City, which was done on <HI>Thur&s;day,
<PB N="9" REF="5">
February</HI> 22d, about four of the Clock in the Afternoon, to the unexpre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction of the People, all the Inhabitants of the Towns round about being got together, and perhaps there never was &s;een at the <HI>Hague</HI> &s;uch a va&s;t concour&s;e of People.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend time in de&s;cribing all the particulars of this Entry, which had nothing of extraordinary Magnificence, except the three Triumphant Arches, which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in Beau|ty and Magnificence, all that was ever made in <HI>France,</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV upon the like Occa&s;ions. There you might &s;ee re|pre&s;ented the Principal Actions of the King, in Honour of whom they were Erected, Ac|companied with &s;everal In&s;criptions and Devi|ces perfectly corre&s;ponding with the Subjects to which they were applyed, and which ap|peared to be done by the hand of a Ma&s;ter. There you might particularly &s;ee <HI>Europe</HI> deli|vered from the gripes of her Ravi&s;her; the Li|berty of <HI>Holland</HI> defended and pre&s;erved; that of <HI>England</HI> re&s;tored; <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;ubdued; and the Prote&s;tant Religion maintained. The whole Ceremony ended in the Evening with Fire-Works in &s;everal places of the City, &s;everal Peals of Cannon and Vallies of &s;mall Shot di&s;|charged, as well by the <HI>Burge&s;&s;es,</HI> as by the Re|giment of <HI>Tri&s;on</HI> which was in Arms, with Bon|fires and Fire-works, before the Court: After all was over, they &s;till continued giving &s;everal Te&s;timonies of their Satisfaction to &s;ee once more a Prince &s;o highly beloved by the <HI>Hollan|ders;</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
and in regard the whole proceeded from a &s;incere Affection, there is a great Probability that the&s;e Rejoyceings will long endure.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide the King manife&s;ted an ex|traordinary Goodne&s;s and Affability to all So|cieties, and private Per&s;ons that came to ki&s;s his Hands. Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> was one of this Number, and his Maje&s;ty honoured him with the command of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet for this Sum|mers Expedition; which was no &s;ooner &s;pread about the Country, but you might &s;en&s;ibly perceive an Augmentation of Joy among the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for the Kings coming: His Coach was environed with crouds of People that fol|lowed him where e're he went; and by a Thou|&s;and Acclamations Te&s;tified their Satisfaction that <HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Conqueror would com|mand their Army by Land; and <HI>Trump,</HI> who ju&s;tly may be called a &s;econd <HI>Neptune,</HI> was to command their Fleet by Sea: and here, for the pre&s;ent, I &s;hall break off my Relations of the tran&s;|actions at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and divert the Reader with my ob&s;ervations on the Place.</P>

<P>THis curious Village and mo&s;t delightful Place, the Re&s;idence of that <HI>Augu&s;t Senate,</HI> which has been, as it were, the Arbiter of Peace,
<PB N="11" REF="6">
and War to all <HI>Europe,</HI> who&s;e charms are &s;o great, its Buildings &s;o Stately and Magnificent, and its &s;treets &s;o large, its &s;hades &s;o &s;weet, its In|habitants &s;o civil, and &s;o good Natur'd, that one may call it the Delight of the World; it hath three very pretty and delightful Meadows on the &s;ide of <HI>Delph,</HI> and Mountains of Sand on the other &s;ide, to cover it from the Rage of the O|cean, which is not above half a League di&s;tant from it; at the end of which is the &s;mall Village called <HI>Scheveling,</HI> which is Inhabited chiefly with Fi&s;hermen, where is a curious hard &s;andy &s;hoar, admirably contrived by Nature, for the Diverti&s;ement of Per&s;ons of Quality; and here in the Summer time the States, foreign Amba|&s;adors, and their Ladies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in their Coaches and &s;ix Hor&s;es, Ride on the Sands for &s;everal Leagues; the road from the <HI>Hague</HI> to this Village is a late made way, cut through va&s;t deep Moun|tains of Sand, paved through with curious &s;tone, a work fit for the Antient <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;ide which looks to <HI>Leiden,</HI> hath a very pretty and large Wood, with curious Walks and Groves, of Oak, Elm, and Lyme-Trees, where there is a Park &s;tored with variety of Deer. The Inhabitants take the Air there in the Sum|mer Sea&s;on, with a Diverti&s;ement capable to render them envy'd even among the Gods, mo|ved by this, that the pretty Ladies, take their plea&s;ure without fear of the Fabulous plunder, &s;o much celebrated by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> whereby po&s;|&s;ibly they &s;ometimes make them real and veri|table.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="7">
The Counts of <HI>Holland</HI> frequently kept their Courts in this palace, chiefly moved thereunto by the plea&s;antne&s;s of the place, and its commo|dious Situation for Hunting; Our King (when <HI>Prince of Orange,)</HI> kept his Court at this place, where he has a mo&s;t &s;tately Palace, the back part of which, with the great Hall, &s;ufficiently te&s;tify its Antiquity. There is on the &s;ide of it, a great &s;quare, in which place, on the &s;ide of the <HI>Levant</HI> are three Magnificent Lodgments, built a few years &s;ince; the <HI>Doeles</HI> make the Cor|ner, whereof His Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, they &s;ay, lay'd the fir&s;t &s;tone: Over again&s;t the other cor|ner is another Palace built by Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> in which are to be &s;een the <HI>Portraitures</HI> of all the Kings in <HI>Europe,</HI> with many curio&s;ities brought from <HI>America.</HI> The <HI>Voorhant</HI> Frontis|piece as well as the Hou&s;es that face the Court on the &s;ide of the <HI>Vivier,</HI> make by far the plea&s;ante&s;t Quarter of the <HI>Hague,</HI> by rea&s;on of the large and &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the Streets, and the number of Trees that are planted there; you may &s;ee great numbers of Per&s;ons of Qua|lity of both Sexes re&s;ort thither in the Even|ing, &s;ome in their Coaches, and &s;ome on Foot. The Cloy&s;ter of the <HI>Jacobines</HI> which was built on the &s;aid <HI>Voorhant,</HI> at this day &s;till retains the name of the Church of the <HI>Cloy&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Church, built much after the form of the <HI>Theater</HI> in <HI>Oxon,</HI> and is of &s;o Admirable a piece of Architecture without, that none within the &s;even Provinces (or &s;carce in the World) is comparable to it; there's no
<PB N="13" REF="7">
pillars within&punc; &s;o that the Mini&s;ter may be &s;een in every place of the Church, by thou&s;ands of People without any Impediment. The Counts of <HI>Holland's</HI> Chapple which is in the Court, is at this day a Church for the <HI>French Refugees;</HI> there are two pretty places like &s;quares, the one be|fore, and the other behind the Court, where all the Hou&s;es re&s;emble tho&s;e of Princes.</P>
<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> re&s;ide here, as well the Councellors of the Provincial Court, as of the Grand Council. The Cities of <HI>Holland</HI> have built here very Magnificent Hou&s;es for their Deputies, of which in my Opinion that of <HI>Ley|den,</HI> is one of the be&s;t Scituate and next the Court. The <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> of princes, the States Allies, have their Re&s;idence here. The <HI>Groote Kirck,</HI> or great Church is very fine, in the mid&s;t of which is to be &s;een the Arms of the Famous Knights, the Order of <HI>Toy&s;on D'ore,</HI> which plainly &s;hews that they there Celebrated the Fea&s;t of the &s;aid <HI>Toy&s;on:</HI> The Tower is very high, and its Form is Quadrangular, built with bricks, which may be &s;een at a va&s;t di|&s;tance: In fine, this place is, at all times, &s;o well Inhabited by Gentry, and Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality; that if we con&s;ider its Splen|dour, the Magnificence of its Buildings and Streets, the affluence of the Nobles, and the plea&s;ure of Conver&s;e; The <HI>Hague</HI> is one of the prettie&s;t Courts, and the mo&s;t agreeable in the Univer&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. III. <HI>Some further Relations on the Affairs &amp; Tran&s;actions at the</HI> HAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the King came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> few days pa&s;t without the Arrival of &s;ome Prin|ces, or other con&s;iderable Per&s;ons, as well to have the Honour to wait upon his Maje&s;ty, as to confer with him about the pre&s;ent Affairs. 'Tis true that mo&s;t of the Princes came <HI>Incogni|to,</HI> as well to avoid the di&s;putes of Precedency, as to confer more Familiarly together, and without the Pe&s;terment of Formalities. The <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who lay at <HI>Cleves</HI> for &s;ome time, in expectation of the Kings coming, no &s;ooner heard of his Arrival by the Courriers that were forthwith di&s;patched to give him no|tice thereof, but he ha&s;tened to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where he Arriv'd in <HI>Cognito,</HI> the 24th of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> The Duke of <HI>Wirtenbergh,</HI> Prince <HI>Regent,</HI> during the Minority of the Heir, and the Prince his Brother arrived the 29th, and were admit|ted to the King a little time after. The Count of <HI>Windi&s;grats,</HI> from the Emperor, Arrived <HI>February</HI> 4th, and was immediately admitted to the King. The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> Arriv'd the 6th, about ten of the Clock at Night, and went to wait upon the King the next day about four a Clock in the Afternoon, with whom he had a Conference of two hours long. The
<PB N="15" REF="8">
Marque&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;tanaga,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h Netherlands,</HI> arriv'd the next day with a jolly Train, of which however but one part appear'd, becau&s;e the Princes were <HI>Incognito.</HI> The <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el</HI> arriv'd the 11th, accompanied by the Count of <HI>Lippe,</HI> the Baron of <HI>Gars,</HI> and &s;everal other Lords. The Prince of <HI>Commerci,</HI> General of the Imperial Forces, arriv'd the 15th. The Duke, and one Prince of <HI>Courland,</HI> arrived the next day. The King regalio'd the greate&s;t part of the&s;e Princes, and was al&s;o plea&s;ed to accept of Entertainments at &s;ome of their Hou&s;es. It would be too long to make a Recital of all the&s;e Fea&s;ts. I &s;hall only therefore mention two; to &s;hew what are the principal Ceremonies ob&s;erved upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty gave an entertainment to the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> the 3d. of <HI>February,</HI> at his Hou&s;e in the Wood; the King had an hours Conference with the <HI>Elector,</HI> which be|ing ended, they entered into a &s;pacious Din|ing Room, where was a Table and Cloth lay'd, with one only &s;ingle Vermeil Furniture, (con&s;i&s;ting of the Gold Plate, fine Napkins, Knife, Fork, and Spoon,) and an Elbow Chair, where the King &s;at down; After that a Chair was brought for the Elector, with a white Sat|tin Cu&s;hion, and a Vermeil Furniture laid him, like the Kings. Then the King Commanded Seats and Furnitures to be brought for all the re&s;t of the Lords that were pre&s;ent, who were placed in this Order: The Elector on the Kings
<PB N="16" REF="9">
Right Hand; next to whom &s;at the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Scarborough, Mon&s;ieur Colbar,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Dankelman,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> &s;at at the lower end of the Table, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the King; The Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> on the Kings Left Hand; next to whom &s;at the Count of <HI>Denhoff,</HI> and then the General <HI>Spaen</HI> clo&s;ed that &s;ide of the Table, next to the Earl of <HI>Portland:</HI> The fir&s;t Health was begun by the King, who whi&s;per'd it &s;oftly to the Ele|ctor, and the Elector to the re&s;t without Na|ming it; after that the King began &s;everal other Healths, which he carried to the Elector, and the Elector to the re&s;t without Naming: The King and the Elector were &s;erved each of them by a Page, all People being put out of the Room, with Orders given to the Guards, to let no Body enter. The Drums beat and the Trumpets &s;ounded when the King and the E|lector drank; but not for any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The 5th of the &s;ame Month the King Di|ned with the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who went out into the very &s;treet to receive him, and car|ried him into a &s;pacious Dining Room, where the Table was covered with Eleven Furnitures; and in a &s;hort time after the meat was &s;erved up. The King &s;at in an Elbow Chair; on the Kings Right hand &s;at the Lord <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> and then the Earl of <HI>Portland:</HI> On the left hand of the Elector &s;ate the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and then the other Lords of the Court, without any di&s;tinc|tion of Precedence; and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Colber,</HI> per|formed the Office of <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Carver,</HI> the Kings

Butler was al&s;o pre&s;ent to pour out the Wine. The King was &s;erved by one of his Pages, and two of his Gentlemen &s;tood behind his Chair. When the King returned, the Elector accom|panied him, to the very Boot of his Coach. All the&s;e Diverti&s;ements of Entertainment, and plea&s;ure, were intermixed with &s;erious Con|ferences, his Maje&s;ty being unwilling to loo&s;e a moment of Con&s;ultation for the general good of the Confederate Affairs: But all the&s;e Conferen|ces are kept &s;o &s;ecret, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to penetrate the knowledge of them; nor &s;hall we under&s;tand the Conclu&s;ions but by the Ef|fects that will follow.

'tis a &s;ingular place to fat Monkeys in. There are Spiders almo&s;t as big as &s;mall Shrimps, their Gardens being moi&s;t, abound with them, and were they but venemous, to gather herbs, were to hazard Martyrdom.</P>
<P>You may travel among them though you have not a guide: For you cannot baulk your Road without the hazard of drowning. There is not there any u&s;e of an Harbinger. Where|&s;oever Men go, the way is made before them, where (if your Fore-man be &s;ober,) you may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ravel in &s;afety, otherwi&s;e you mu&s;t have &s;tronger Faith than <HI>Peter</HI> had, el&s;e you &s;ink im|mediately. A &s;tarting hor&s;e endangers you to two Deaths at once, breaking of your Neck, and Drowning.</P>
<P>Some things the <HI>Bores</HI> do here that &s;eem won|ders. 'Tis ordinary to &s;ee them fi&s;h for Fire in
<PB N="19" REF="10">
Water, which they catch in Nets, and tran|&s;port to Land in their Boots, where they &s;praed it more &s;moothly, than a Mercer doth his Vel|vet, when he would hook in an Heir upon his coming to Age. Thus lying in a Field, you would think you &s;aw a Cantle of green Chee&s;e &s;pread over with black butter.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Pack-hor&s;es are all of Wood, carying their Bridles in their tails, and their Bur|dens in their Bellies. When they travel they touch no ground, and when they &s;tand &s;till they ride; and are never in danger but when they drink up too much of their way.</P>
<P>The Elements are here at variance, the Sub|tile over&s;waying the Gro&s;&s;er. The Pire con|&s;umes Earth, and the Air the Water. They burn turffs, and drain their Grounds with Wind|mills, as if the Cholick were a Remedy for the Stone; and they would prove again&s;t Philo&s;o|phy the Worlds Conflagration to be Natural, even &s;hewing thereby that the very Elements of Earth is combu&s;table.</P>
<P>The Land that they have, they keep as neat|ly as a Courtier does his Beard: They have a method in Mowing. 'Tis &s;o interven'd with Water and Rivers, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to make a Common among them.</P>
<P>Though their Country be part of a main land, yet every hou&s;e almo&s;t, that's Inhabited by the <HI>Boars,</HI> &s;tands in an <HI>I&s;land.</HI> And that though the <HI>Boar</HI> dwell in it, looks as &s;mug as a Lady that hath newly lockt up her Colours, and laid by her Irons. A Gallant Ma&s;quing

<P>If it &s;tand dry 'tis embraced by <HI>Vines;</HI> But if you find it lower &s;eated, 'tis only a clo&s;e Ar|bor in a plump of Willows and Alders, plea|&s;ant enough while the Dog-days la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Bridge to this is a Fir-plank with a Box of &s;tones to poiz it withal, which with the lea&s;t help turns round like the Executioner when he whips off a Head: That when the Ma&s;ter is over, &s;tands drawn, and then he is in his Ca&s;tle: 'Tis &s;ure his fear that renders him &s;upicious; That he may therefore certainly &s;ee who enters, you &s;hall ever find his window made over his Door.</P>
<P>When you are entred the hou&s;e, the fir&s;t thing you encounter is a Looking-Gla&s;s; no que&s;tion but a true Embleme of Politick Ho&s;|pitality; for though it reflect your &s;elf in your own Figure, 'tis yet no longer than while you are there before it: When you are gone once, it Flatters the next Comer, without the lea&s;t remembrance that you e'er were there.</P>
<P>The next are the Ve&s;&s;els of the Hou&s;e Mar&s;hal'd about the Room like Watch-men; All as neat as if you were in a Citizens Wives Cabbinet; for unle&s;s it be them&s;elves, they let none of Gods Creatures lo&s;e any thing of their Native Beauty. The Linings of their Hou&s;es is more Rich than the Out-&s;ide, not in Hangings, but Pictures, which even the poore&s;t of the <HI>Boars,</HI> are there furni&s;h'd with: Not a Cobler but has his Toys for Orna|ment.

Were the Knacks of all their Hou&s;es &s;et together, there would not be &s;uch ano|ther <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Their Beds are no other than Land-Ca|bins, high enough to need a Ladder, or Stairs: Up once, you are walled in with Wain&s;cot, and that is good di&s;cretion to avoid the trou|ble of making your Will every Night; for once falling out, el&s;e would break your Neck perfectly. But if you die in it, this Comfort you &s;hall leave your Friends, that you died in clean Linnen.</P>
<P>You may &s;ooner Convert a <HI>Jew,</HI> than to make an ordinary <HI>Dutch-man</HI> yeild to Argu|ments that cro&s;s him. A Old Bawd is ea&s;iler turn'd Saint, than a Waggoner per&s;waded not to bait thrice in nine Miles. And when he doth, his Hor&s;es mu&s;t not &s;tir, but have their Manger brought them into the way, where in a top &s;weat they eat their Gra&s;s, and drink their Water, and pre&s;ently after hurry away: For they ever drive as if they were all the Sons of <HI>Nim&s;hi,</HI> and were furi|ou&s;ly either pur&s;uing an Enemy, or flying him.</P>
<P>They are &s;eldom deceiv'd, for they tru&s;t no Body; &s;o by Con&s;equence are better to hold a Fort, than win it; yet they can do both. Tru&s;t them you mu&s;t if you Travel; For to ask a Bill of Particulars, is to purr in a Wa&s;ps Ne&s;t, you mu&s;t pay what they ask, as &s;ure as if it were the A&s;&s;e&s;sment of a Sub&s;idy.</P>

Complements is an Idlene&s;s they were never train'd up in, and 'tis their happine&s;s, that Court Vanities have not &s;tole away their minds from Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sailers among them are as common as Beggars with us. They can drink, rail, &s;wear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but examining their u&s;e, a me&s;s of their Knaves are worth a Million of outs, for they, in a Boi&s;terous Rudene&s;s, can work, and live, and Toil, whereas ours will rather Laize them|&s;elves to Poverty, and like Cabbages left out in Winter, rot away in the Loath&s;omene&s;s of a Nau&s;eous Sloth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of them are Seamen born, and like Frogs can live both on Land and Water. Not a <HI>Country-Urie&s;ter</HI> but can handle an Oar, Steer a Boat, rai&s;e a Ma&s;t, and beat you out in the roughe&s;t Straits you come in. The Ship &s;he avouches much better for Sleep than a bed.</P>
<P>In their Families they all are equals, and you have no way to know the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s but by taking them in Bed together. It may be tho&s;e are they; Otherwi&s;e <HI>Malky</HI> can prate as much, laugh as loud, be as bold, and &s;it as well as her Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Their Women would have good Faces if they did not marr them with making. Their <HI>Ear-Wyers</HI> have &s;o nipt in their Cheeks, that you would think &s;ome <HI>Fairy,</HI> to do them a Mi&s;|chief, had pincht them behind with tongs. The&s;e they dre&s;s, as if they would &s;hew you all their wit lay behind, and they needs would cover it. And thus ordered, they have much more for Head than Face.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="12">
They love the <HI>Engli&s;h Gentry</HI> well; and when Soldiers come over to be billeted among them, they are emulous in chu&s;ing of their gue&s;t; who fares much the better for being liked by his Ho&s;te&s;s.</P>
<P>The habit of the Men is much after the <HI>Tar|paullian</HI> Fa&s;hion; their Breeches yawning at the Knees, as if they were about to &s;wallow his Legs unmercifully.</P>
<P>The Women are far from going naked, for of a whole Woman you can &s;ee but half a Face: As for her hand, that &s;hews her a &s;ore Labourer; which you &s;hall ever find (as it were in Recom|pence) loaden with Rings to the cracking of her Fingers.</P>
<P>Where the Woman lies in, the Ringle of the door does pennance, and is lapped about with Linnen, either to &s;hew you that loud knocking may wake the child, or el&s;e that for a month the Ring is not to be run at. But if the child be dead, there is thru&s;t out a No&s;egay tied to a &s;ticks end; perhaps for an Emblem of the Life of Man, which may wither as &s;oon as born; or el&s;e to let you know, that though the&s;e fade upon their gathering, yet from the &s;ame &s;tock the next year a new &s;hoot may &s;pring.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they are a race of People diligent ra|ther than Laborious; dull and &s;low of under|&s;tanding, and &s;o not dealt with by ha&s;ty words, but managed ea&s;ily by &s;oft and fair; and yiel|ding to plain Rea&s;on, if you give them time to under&s;tand it. They know no other good,

but the &s;upply of what Nature requires, and the common increa&s;e of Wealth. They feed mo&s;t upon Herbs, Roots, and Milks; and by that means, I &s;uppo&s;e, neither their &s;trength, nor Vigor, &s;eems an&s;werable to the &s;ize, Bulk, of their Bodies.</P>

<HEAD>Sect. V. <HI>Of the Nature of the Country in General, its Scituation,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FOur of the&s;e Provinces. <HI>Viz.</HI> that of <HI>Hol|land, Zealand, Friezeland,</HI> and <HI>Gromingven,</HI> are &s;eated upon the Sea, and make the &s;trength and greatne&s;s of this State: The other three, with the Conquered Towns in <HI>Brabant, Flan|ders,</HI> and <HI>Cleve,</HI> make only the Out-works or Frontires, &s;erving chiefly for &s;afety and Defence of the&s;e.</P>
<P>The Soil of the whole Province of <HI>Holland</HI> is generally Flat, like the Sea in a calm, and looks as if, after a long contention, between Land and Water, which it &s;hould belong to: It had at length been divided between them: For to con|&s;ider the great Rivers, and the &s;trange number of Canals that are found in this Province, and do not only lead to every great Town, but al|mo&s;t to every Village; and the infinity of Sails that are &s;een every where cour&s;ing up and down upon them; One would imagine the Water to have &s;hared with the Land; and the People that
<PB N="25" REF="13">
live in Boats, to hold &s;ome proportion with tho&s;e that live in Hou&s;es. And this is one great advantage towards Trade, which is Na|tural to the Scituation, and not to be attained in any Country, where there is not the &s;ame level and &s;oftne&s;s of Soil, which makes the cut|ting of Canals &s;o ea&s;ie work, as to be attempted almo&s;t by every private Man; and one Hor&s;e &s;hall draw in a Boat, more than Fifty can do by Cart, whereas Carriage make a great part of the price in all heavy Commodities: And by this ea&s;ie way of Travelling, an indu&s;trious Man lo&s;es no time from his Bu&s;ine&s;s, for he Writes, or Eats, or Sleeps, while he goes; whereas the time of Labouring or Indu&s;trious Men, is the greate&s;t Native Commodity of any Country.</P>
<P>There is, be&s;ides, one very great lake of Fre&s;h-Water &s;till remaining in this Province, by the Name of <HI>Harlem Maer,</HI> which might as they &s;ay, be ea&s;ily drained; but the City of <HI>Ley|den</HI> having no other way of refre&s;hing their Town, or renewing the Water of their Canals, but from this <HI>Maer,</HI> will never con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>Another Advantage of their Scituation of Trade, is made by tho&s;e two great Rivers of the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;e,</HI> reaching up, and Navigable, &s;o mighty a length, into &s;o Rich and Populus Countries of the higher and lower <HI>Germany;</HI> which as it brings down all the Commodities from tho&s;e parts to the <HI>Magazines</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> that vent them by their Shipping into all parts of the World, where the Market calls for them;
<PB N="26" REF="14">
&s;o, with &s;omething more labour and time, it returns all the Merchandi&s;e of other Parts, into tho&s;e Countries, that are &s;eated upon the&s;e Streams,</P>
<P>The Flatne&s;s of their Land expo&s;es it to the danger of the Sea, and forces them to infinite charge, in the continual Fences and Repairs of their Banks to oppo&s;e it; which employ yearly more Men, than all the Corn of the Province of <HI>Holland</HI> could maintain. They have found the common Sea-weed to be the be&s;t Material for the&s;e Digues, which fa&s;tens with a thin Mixture of Earth, yields a little to the force of the Sea, and returns when the Waves give back.</P>
<P>The extream moi&s;ture of the Air, I take to be the Occa&s;ion of the great Neatne&s;s in their Towns; for without the help of tho&s;e Cu|&s;toms, their Country would not be habitable by &s;uch Crowds of People, but the Air would corrupt upon every hot &s;ea&s;on, and expo&s;e the Inhabitants to general and infectious Di&s;ea&s;es, which they hardly e&s;cape three Summers toge|ther, e&s;pecially about <HI>Leyden,</HI> where the Wa|ters are not &s;o ea&s;ily renewed; and for this rea|&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, it is, that <HI>Leyden</HI> is found to be the neate&s;t and cleane&s;t kept of all their Towns.</P>
<P>The &s;ame moi&s;ture of Air makes all Mettals apt to ru&s;t, and Wood to mould; which forces them, by continual pains of rubbing and &s;cou|ring, to &s;eek a prevention or cure: This makes the brightne&s;s and cleane&s;s that &s;eems affected
<PB N="27" REF="14">
in their Hou&s;es, and is call'd Natural to them, by People who think no further. So the deep|ne&s;s of their Soil, and wetne&s;s of Sea&s;ons, which would render it unpa&s;&s;ible, forces them not on|ly to exactne&s;s of paving in their Streets, but to the expence of &s;o long Caw&s;ies between ma|ny of their Towns, and in their High-ways; As indeed, mo&s;t National Cu&s;toms are the Ef|fects of &s;ome un&s;een, or un-ob&s;erved, Natural Cau&s;es or Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>The lowne&s;s and flatne&s;s of their Lands, make it in a great mea&s;ure the Richne&s;s of their Soil, that is ea&s;ily over-flowed every Winter, &s;o as the whole Country, at that Sea&s;on, &s;eems to lye under Water, which in Spring, is driven out again by Mills.</P>

<P>THe People of <HI>Holland</HI> may be divided into the&s;e &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es: The <HI>Pe&s;ants</HI> or <HI>Boars,</HI> who cultivate the Land. The <HI>Marriners</HI> or <HI>Schippers,</HI> who &s;upply their Ships. The <HI>Mer|chants,</HI> or <HI>Traders,</HI> who fill their Towns. The <HI>Renteeners,</HI> or Men that live in all their chief Cities upon the Rents, or Intere&s;ts of E&s;tates for|merly acquired in their Families: And the Gen|tlemen, and Officers of their Armies.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="15">
The Fir&s;t we have already treated off in a Sect by them&s;elves, in regard of the giving a more particular Character of their Manners and Humours.</P>
<P>The Second, The <HI>Marriners,</HI> are a plain Peo|ple, but of a very rough Hew; whether from the Element they live in, or from their Food, which is generally Fi&s;h and Corn, and heartier than that of the <HI>Boars:</HI> They are Surly, and Ill-manner'd, which is mi&s;taken for Pride; but, I believe, is learnt, as all manners are, by the conver&s;ation we u&s;e. Now theirs lying only among one another, or with Winds and Waves, which are not mov'd nor wrought upon by any Language, or Ob&s;ervance; or to be dealt with, but by Pains and by Patience; the&s;e are all the Qualities, their <HI>Marriners</HI> have learnt; their Language is little more, than what is of nece&s;|&s;ary u&s;e to their Bu&s;ine&s;s; their Valour is of a &s;ize extraordinary even beyond compari&s;on, ex|cept with that of the <HI>Engli&s;h Tarpaulin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Merchants</HI> and <HI>Trades-men,</HI> both the Greater and Mechanick, living in Towns that are of great re&s;ort, both by Strangers and Pa&s;|&s;engers of their own, are more Mercurial, (VVit being &s;harpned by Commerce and Con|ver&s;ation of Cities, though they are not very inventive, which is the gift of warmer Heads; yet are they great in imitation, and &s;o far, many times, as goes beyond the Originals: Of mighty Indu&s;try, and con&s;tant Application to the ends they propo&s;e and pur&s;ue. They make u&s;e of their Skill, and their VVit, to take ad|vantage
<PB N="29" REF="15">
of other Mens Ignorance and Folly, they deal with: Are great Exacters, where the Law is in their own hands. In other points where they deal with Men that under&s;tand like them&s;elves, and are under the reach of Ju&s;tice and Laws, they are the plaine&s;t and be&s;t dea|lers in the World; which &s;eems not to grow &s;o much from a principle of Con&s;cience, or Morali|ty, as from a Cu&s;tom or Habit introduced by the nece&s;&s;ity of Trade among them, which de|pends as much upon common hone&s;ty, as War does upon Di&s;cipline; and without which, all would break; Merchants would turn Pedlars, and Soldiers Thieves.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Families which live upon their Patri|monial E&s;tates in all the great Cities, are a peo|ple differently bred and manner'd from the Tra|ders, though like them in the mode&s;ty of Garb and Habit, and the par&s;imony of living. Their Youth are generally bred up at Schools, and at the Univer&s;ities of <HI>Leyden,</HI> or <HI>Utretcht,</HI> in the common &s;tudies of Humane Learning, but chief|ly of the civil law, which is that of their Country.</P>
<P>Where the&s;e Families are Rich, their Youths, after a cour&s;e of their Studies at home, travel for &s;ome years, as the &s;ons of our Gentry u&s;e to do; but their Journeys are chiefly into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> not much into <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;eldomer into <HI>Spain,</HI> nor often into the more <HI>Northern-Countries,</HI> un|le&s;s in Company or train of their publick Mini|&s;ters. The chief end of their Breeding, is, to make them fit for the Service of their Country in the Magi&s;tracy of their Towns, their Pro|vinces
<PB N="30" REF="16">
and their State. And of the&s;e kind of Men are the civil Officers of this Government generally compo&s;ed, being de&s;cended of Fami|lies, who have many times been con&s;tantly in the Magi&s;tracy of their Native Towns for ma|ny years, and &s;ome for &s;everal Ages, and not Men of mean or Mechanick Trades, as it is commonly receiv'd among Foreigners, and makes the Subject of commical Je&s;ts upon their Government. This does not exclude many Merchants or Traders ingro&s;s from being &s;een in the Offices of their Cities, and &s;ometimes de|puted to their E&s;tates; nor &s;everal of their States from turning their Stocks in the manage|ment of &s;ome very beneficial Trade by Servants, and hou&s;es maintained to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The next Rank among them, is that of their Gentlemen or Nobles, who, in this Province of <HI>Holland</HI> are very few, mo&s;t of the Families having been extingui&s;hed in the long Wars with <HI>Spain.</HI> But tho&s;e that remain, are in a man|ner all imploy'd in the Military or Civil Char|ges of the Province or State. The&s;e are, in their Cu&s;toms and Manners, much different from the re&s;t of the people; and having been bred much abroad, rather effect the Garb of of their Neighbour Courts, than the popular Air of their own Country. They &s;trive to imi|tate the <HI>French</HI> in their Meen, their Cloaths, their way of Talk, of Eating, of Gallantry, or Debauchery. They are otherwi&s;e an Hone&s;t, Well-natur'd, Friendly, and Gentlemanly &s;ort of Men, and acquit them&s;elves generally with
<PB N="31" REF="16">
Honour and Merit, where their Country em|ploys them.</P>
<P>The Officers of their Armies live after the Cu&s;tom, and Fa&s;hions of the Gentlemen.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome Cu&s;toms, or Di&s;po&s;itions, that &s;eem to run generally through all degrees of Men among them; as great Frugality, and Order, in their Expences. Their common Ri|ches lye in every mans &s;pending le&s;s than he has coming in, be that what it will: Nor does it enter into Mens heads among them, that the common part or cour&s;e of Expence &s;hould equal the Revenue; and when this happens, they think at lea&s;t they have lived that year to no purpo&s;e; and the train of it di&s;credits a man a|mong them, as much as any Vicious or Prodi|gal Extravagance does in other Countries. This enables every man to bear their extreme Taxes, and makes them le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than they would be in other places, e&s;pecially in <HI>England:</HI> For he that lives upon two parts in five of what he has coming in; if he pays two more to the State, he does but part with what he &s;hould have laid up, and had no pre&s;ent u&s;e for; whereas, he that &s;pends yearly what he receives, if he pays but the fiftieth part to the Publick, it goes from him like that which was nece&s;&s;ary to buy bread or Clothes for him&s;elf or his Family.</P>
<P>This makes the Beauty and &s;trength of their Towns, the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of travelling in their Country by their <HI>Canals, Bridges,</HI> and <HI>Caw&s;eys;</HI> the plea&s;antne&s;s of their Walks, and their Grafts in and near all their Cities; and in
<PB N="32" REF="17">
&s;hort, the Beauty, Convenience, and &s;ome|times Magnificence of their publick Works, to which every Man pays as willingly, and takes as much plea&s;ure, and vanity in them, as tho&s;e of other Countries do in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, among the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their Families or private Inheritance.</P>
<P>To conclude this Section: <HI>Holland</HI> is a Coun|try, where the Earth is better than the Air, and profit more in Reque&s;t than Honour; where there is more &s;en&s;e than wit; more good na|ture than good humour; and more wealth than plea&s;ure; where a man would chu&s;e rather to Travel, than to live; &s;hall find more things to ob&s;erve than de&s;ire; and more Per&s;ons to e&s;teem than to love. But the &s;ame Qualities and Di&s;|po&s;itions do not Value a private Man and a State, nor make a conver&s;ation agreeable, and a Govern|ment great: Nor is it unlikely, that &s;ome very great King might make but a very ordina|ry private-Gentleman, and &s;ome very extraor|dinary Gentlemen, might be capable of making but a very mean Prince.</P>

<P>Of all other Religions, every Man enjoys the free exerci&s;e in his own Chamber, or his own Hou&s;e, unque&s;tioned, and un&s;pyed: And if the Followers of any Sect grow &s;o numerous in any place, that they affect a publick Congregation, and are content to purcha&s;e a place of A&s;&s;embly, to bear the charge of a Pa&s;tor, or Teacher, and to pay for this Liberty to the Publick; they go and propo&s;e their de&s;ire to the Magi&s;trate of the place where they re&s;ide, who inform them&s;elves of their Opinions, and Manners of Wor&s;hip; and if they find nothing in either, de&s;tructive to civil Society, or prejudicial to the Con&s;titutions of their State, and content them&s;elves with the price that is offer'd for the purcha&s;e of this Li|berty, they ea&s;ily allow it; but with the condi|tion, that one or more Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall be appointed, who &s;hall have free Admi&s;&s;ion at all their Meetings, &s;hall be both the Ob&s;ervers and Witne&s;&s;es of all that is Acted or Preached among them, and who&s;e Te&s;timony &s;hall be received concerning any thing that pa&s;&s;es there, to the prejudice of the State; in which ca&s;e, the Laws and Executions are as &s;evere as again&s;t any civil Crimes.</P>

The <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> are ju&s;t the contrary, very numerous, but in the Low|er Ranks of People, Mechanicks and Seamen, and abound chiefly in <HI>North Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> make the Body of the People, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the publick Churches in the Dominions of the State, as well as of the only Mini&s;ters or Pa&s;tors, who are maintained by the Publick.</P>
<P>It's hardly to be imagined, how all the Vio|lence and Sharpne&s;s, which Accompanies the differences of Religion in other Countries, &s;eems to be appea&s;ed or &s;oftned here, by the general freedom which all men enjoy, either by Allow|ance or Connivance. I believe the force of Commerce, Alliances, and Acquaintance, &s;pread|ing &s;o far as they do in &s;mall circuits (&s;uch as the Province of <HI>Holland)</HI> may contribute much to make conver&s;ation, and all the Offices of com|mon life, &s;o ea&s;y, among &s;o different Opinions, of which &s;o many &s;everal per&s;ons are often in every Man's eye; and no man checks or takes offence at Faces, or Cu&s;toms, or Ceremonies, he &s;ees every day, as at tho&s;e he hears of in pla|ces

<P>'TIs evident to tho&s;e, who have read the mo&s;t, and travel'd farthe&s;t, that no Country can be found either in this pre&s;ent Age, or upon Record of any Story, where &s;o va&s;t a Trade has been managed, as in the nar|row compa&s;s of the four Maritine Provinces of this Common-wealth: Nay it is generally e&s;teem'd, that they have more Shipping belongs to them, than there does to the far greater part of <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides.

Nor do I know any thing properly of their own growth, that is con&s;iderable, either for their own nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e, or for Traffick with their Neighbours, be&s;ides Butter, Chee&s;e, and Earthen Wares. For <HI>Havens,</HI> they have not any good upon their whole Coa&s;t: The be&s;t are <HI>Helver&s;luys,</HI> which has no Trade at all; and <HI>Flu&s;hingue,</HI> which has little, in compari&s;on of other Towns in <HI>Holland:</HI> But <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> that Triumphs in the &s;poils of <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> (which before Engro&s;t the greate&s;t Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> and the <HI>Indias)</HI> &s;eems to be the mo&s;t incommodious <HI>Haven</HI> they have, being &s;eated upon &s;o &s;hallow Waters, that or|dinary Ships cannot come up to it without the advantage of Tides; nor great ones without unlading.
