<P>_WHereas of late yeeres, there hath ben an intermi&s;&s;ion of the free traffike of Marchants, betwixt the kingdomes and countreys of the Queenes Maie&s;tie of England, and the king of Portugall, by rea&s;on of certaine &s;tayes and arre&s;ts made of diuers &s;ubiects on both partes, with their goods and &s;hyps, to the hynderaunce and di&s;commoditie of both the &s;ayd Realmes and kyngdomes, without any intention of either of the &s;ayd Princes to breake or violate the auncient amities and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ederati|ons continuing in force betwixt them, or to di&s;continue the &s;ayd traffike: but that, as it appeareth, the &s;ame arre&s;tes haue ben fir&s;t occa&s;ioned by per&s;ons regarding more their priuate gaine, then the continuaunce of &s;uch an auncient amitie, nouri&s;hed and maintayned by the mutual com|merce of the &s;ubiects on eyther part. So it is, that both their Maie&s;ties good meanings towardes the continuance of their mutuall amitie, and re&s;toring of the &s;ayd traffike, being made knowen from the one to the other by &s;uch their good mini&s;ters as haue beene herein v&s;ed: Therefore it is in their names accorded, that all maner &s;ubiects of both the &s;ayd Princes, of what kingdome or Countrey &s;o euer they be, from the xv. day of this pre&s;ent moneth of Nouember, &s;hall and may from the &s;ayde time v&s;e the like mutuall traffike for Marchandizes, and in the &s;ame places: that is to &s;ay, her Ma|ie&s;ties &s;ubiects, in the kingdomes of Portugall and Algarbia, and in the Iles of Medera and Azore: and likewi&s;e the &s;ubiects of the kyng of Portugal, in England and Ireland, as they were lawfully accu&s;tomed before the &s;aid arre&s;tes. And for that it is meant, that all occa&s;ions of controuer&s;ies and differences, that haue happened betwixt the &s;ubiects of either part, &s;ince the time of the &s;ayd arre&s;ts, &s;hould be heard and determined: It is ordeyned, that this re&s;titution of the traffike, &s;hall remayne from the &s;aid xv day of Nouember, during the &s;pace of three yeeres next en&s;uing, to the intent that diuers Commi&s;&s;ioners (to be appointed by the &s;aid Princes withithin three moneths after the &s;ayde xv day of this Nouember) may &s;peedily heare, order, and determine, &s;uch differences: And that at the end of the &s;ayd three yeeres, yf by the &s;ayd Princes in the meane time it be not otherwi&s;e prouided for continuaunce of the &s;ayd traffike to haue a perpetuall continuaunce, no new arre&s;tes &s;halbe made of any things brought into the kingdomes and Iles afore&s;ayd, of eyther of the &s;ayd princes, during the time of the &s;ayd three yeeres. Wherefore the Queenes Maie&s;tie hath thought it nece&s;&s;ary, like as it is agreed, that they &s;ayd king of Portugall &s;hall do the like, to notifie to all her &s;ubiects the pre|mi&s;&s;es, to thintent they may (as they &s;hall finde meet and conuenient) re&s;ort to the kingdomes and Ilandes afore&s;ayd of the &s;ayd king, and there v&s;e the lawfull and free traffike of Marchaundizes, as before the la&s;t re&s;traynt was lawfully by them v&s;ed: Charging them to geue none occa&s;ion of of|fence to the &s;aid king or his &s;ubiects, but to behaue them&s;elues in &s;uch &s;ort, as thamitie betwixt the &s;ayd Princes, and traffike betwixt their &s;ubiects may continue, to the honor and comfort of the Prin|ces and the mutuall concord and benefite of their people. The like whereof, it is accorded &s;hall bee performed on the &s;aid kings part, for him and his &s;ubiects, re&s;orting into any of her Maie&s;ties domi|nions: to whom al&s;o &s;halbe &s;hewed like fauor for maintenance of their &s;aid traffike, as in times pa&s;t before the arre&s;t hath ben. And for more full &amp; ample declaration of both their Maie&s;ties good in|tens, for the pre&s;eruation of the &s;ayd amitie and friend&s;hip betweene them, and their &s;ayd Realmes and &s;ubiects: it is ordered and agreed on both parts, that neither of their &s;aid Maie&s;ties &s;hall receiue any Pirate or Rouer, into any of the Portes or Creekes of either of their Realmes, Dominions, and Countreys, which may, and &s;hall haue committed any piracie or robberie vpon eyther of their Sub|iectes, nor &s;hall &s;hew any fauour, giue any ayde or &s;uccour, or &s;uffer any to be geuen directly or indi|rectly to the &s;ayde Rouers or Pirates. And moreouer, that neither of theyr &s;ayde Maie&s;ties &s;hall, duryng the time of the &s;ayde amitie and friend&s;hippe, in either of their kyngdomes, or any place of their Dominions, fauour, entertaine, receiue, or reteyne, nor &s;uffer to be fauoured, enterteyned, re|ceyued, or reteyned, by any of their &s;ubiects, any Rebels, Traytours, or Fugitiues, &s;ubiects to either of their &s;ayd Maie&s;ties, nor geue any ayde, fauour, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or &s;uffer to bee geuen, to any &s;uch

And for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> it may fall out, by rea&s;on of the publication of this pre&s;ent accord here within her Maie&s;ties Dominions, that &s;ome of her Maie&s;ties &s;ubiects may happen to traffike into the kyngs &s;ayd king|domes, and for want of not vnder&s;tanding this pre&s;ent conclu&s;ion and agreement, by the &s;aid kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ter, be arre&s;ted there: it is al&s;o accorded, that vpon notice geuen vnto the &s;ayd king, the &s;hippes is arre&s;ted after the &s;ayd xv. day of this Nouember, &s;halbe immediatly relea&s;ed, without any fur|ther proce&s;&s;e of lawe, vpon bare notice and intimation of the &s;ame.
