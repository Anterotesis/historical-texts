<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS Wonderful BREACH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Figure is almo&s;t circular, po&s;ited in a declining condition to the Horizon, it being the end or fragment of a hilly body, and contains about two Acres of ground. In its upper Divi&s;on, or primary Breach, the lower, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of it, lies a Yard (in &s;ome places) beneath the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">moved body: ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> three parts of this c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ar won|der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hews &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the efficient cau&s;e; and the re&s;t &s;hews little, or no defect.</P>
<P>About three paces from the upper Breach, (or prime Divi&s;on) is a &s;econd Trench all down one Curve of the Circle, (afore&s;aid) and &s;ome &s;econd Fractures on the other &s;ide the&s;e be over the prime Trench or Breach li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th a narrow path way; the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n part, who&s;e Hypo|tenu&s;al &s;hould fall upon the true Angular Point, (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it

<P>Between the Prime Breach, and &s;econd Curvery Fra|cture, the Earth &s;hews a Perpendicular Decent, or Down|right Falling, becau&s;e it doth thru&s;t it &s;elf within its for|mer bounds; on the other &s;ide of the Curve, which is higher Ground, the parts of the Earth fallen, and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al|len, &s;hews the di&s;tance of a Foot; which if it &s;hould be rai&s;ed to a Parallel with its former Bounds, would dif|fer half a Yard. The Sine for the&s;e Curves, is the Ra|dius, or total Sine.</P>
<P>The lower part of the Periphery, (or Arch oppo&s;ite to the Primary Breach) is rolled in, with an over&s;hoot|ing of his Bounds; as if it were driven, being light in &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;tones (in &s;ome places thereof) thru&s;ts forth them&s;elves. This lower Curve contains about half the Radius for its ver&s;ed Sine.</P>
<P>The unbreached part of the Periphery lies on the lower &s;ide of the Hill, in re&s;pect to the Hills ridge.</P>

<HEAD>Some Per&s;ons judge WATER to be the cau&s;e of the BREACH; others, &s;ay WIND.</HEAD>

<HEAD><HI>REASONS Negative, and Affirmative,</HI> That it was not WATER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. Water doth naturally run in a Channel, ha&s;t|ing forward, yea, and that where the Ground is level: but where the Ground de&s;cendeth through which it's to pa&s;s, there it forceth with a more direct cour&s;e, and &s;peedy &s;tream; not dilating it &s;elf, but rather drawing its Body more clo&s;e into narrow Bounds.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 2. If Water had been the cau&s;e, then it &s;hould not have run in a round Figure, where the Hill is &s;o much de&s;cending; unle&s;s &s;ome artificial Pipes had been laid, which by the attractive power of the Air &s;hould draw the Water up again; which if Fancy, or any per&s;ons Suppo&s;ition &s;hould incline to, yet neverthele&s;s it would have more powerful force in its De&s;cent, than A&s;cent.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 3. Had Water (by its violent Billows) caus'd this Accident, it would either have done it by an Erup|tion outward, or a Di&s;&s;olution of the Earth within, where|by the upper Superncies &s;hould have fallen in, or &s;unk within its counterminal Sides. Indeed, &s;ome part of the Ground we allow to be depre&s;&s;ed, but another part is not, but rather heightned, by rolling up. And how any thing &s;hould produce contrary effects to its nature, is marvellous!</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 4. Had Water been the cau&s;e by demoli&s;hing the intrels of the Earth, then (running in a Channel) the Breach &s;hould be oppo&s;ite to its Current; and &s;hould from hence the current of Water be gue&s;t to fall where the Ground is fallen in all down one Curve of the Circle, then &s;hould not other Breach con&s;iderable appear from its Production, and the Earth would have been over&s;hot or carry'd that way as the Current of Water pa&s;t; but the Earth is carried that way where no &s;uch &s;alling in appears.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 27 -->
<HEAD>That it was WIND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e it's &s;o improbable to be Water; but we judge Wind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, fora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">much as it is its property to produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 2 For Wind being gathered, and &s;treightned within the Bowels of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arth, in order to an Earth|quake, doth at la&s;t (by a vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tile motion) break or bur&s;t forth in &s;ome plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or other, with g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at violence, rending, tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing in, and burying the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> within is own b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vels: and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s motion, arc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng, flying, and &s;earching about, might (very naturally) cau&s;e this Breach.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 3. Becau&s;e the lower part of the Periphery which is over&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lies rolled in, hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, or blown&punc; dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from its &s;wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n (or enlarged) Pores, Stones o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a con&s;i|derable weight: as al&s;o the root of a Tree, which is turned up in the Primary Breach.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 4. This being at the Front of a hilly Range, the Earthquake might come running along, and there di&s;|burden it &s;elf: and that moreover that it's free from Rocks, the Ground &s;olvable; and con&s;equently the Pores more ea&s;ily extended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 27 -->
<HEAD>Arguments corre&s;ponding with the former Rea&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Arg.</HI> If Water had been the cau&s;e, then from a &s;lant De&s;cent, or A&s;cent, the Breach would have &s;hewed it &s;elf in a right lined, or &s;erpentine Figure, and more e&s;pecially in a right lined Figure, its Surface having Declination.</P>
<P>But this Breach is circular, and declining, contrary to a right lined, or &s;erpentine Figure.</P>
<P>Therefore the Cau&s;e could not be Water.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Arg</HI> Water was not the Cau&s;e, but rather Wind; for Wind is volotile, light, and forcible, and known to be of circular motion; where it's &s;treighten'd, and wants liberty to disburden, or di&s;per&s;e it &s;elf into its own Element, it &s;earches a pa&s;&s;age, and by Operation, is (by Philo&s;ophers) accounted the cau&s;e of Earthquakes, it vents, and turns up the Earth in its delivery thence.</P>
<P>But, in this Breach the Figure is circular, diver&s;ly fra|ctured, blown or hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> up, writhed, which are the Sym|ptoms of an Earthquake.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo.</HI> Wind was the proper and true Cau&s;e.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="objections">
<PB N="6" REF="5" MS="y"><!-- PDF PAGE 28 -->
<HEAD>Now it remains that we an&s;wer three Objections, and conclude.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Object.</HI> May &s;ome &s;ay, Had there been an Earth|quake, why was it not di&s;cerned, felt, or di&s;covered by one or other?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Object.</HI> Though Towns be not very nigh, yet there be &s;ome Inhabitants on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore&s;t nigh re&s;ident, and would not they have been &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome motion or noi&s;e which accompany Earthquakes?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Object.</HI> There be many Trees not far off, would not &s;ome of them have receiv'd prejudice by overturn|ing, or Rocks where you &s;uppo&s;e the windy commotion ran along.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answers">
<HEAD>An&s;wers to the Objections.</HEAD>
<P>An&s;. 1. <HI>Had there been any Inhabitants dwelling on the &s;aid Hill, they might then have felt it.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;. 2. <HI>As for them that dwell nigh, they might very well be un&s;en&s;ible of noi&s;e, or motion, which might hap|pen in the Night; and becau&s;e Earthquakes (more general ones) have been experienced to operate in one part of the Town, and not in another part of the &s;ame; or in a various manner, in little di&s;tance; no wonder then if &s;uch Inhabitants perceive it not.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;. 3. <HI>As for Trees, how &s;hould they be prejudic'd, where the Earthquake came not? but had Trees &s;tood where the Breach was made, they would probably then have been overthrown (as the roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a Tree afore&s;aid) and as for Rocks being not removed over the windy pa&s;|&s;age, they might be &s;par'd for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the ground in tho&s;e places was; and both &s;pared, becau&s;e the di&s;turbance ha&s;tens along to the Front, as a Stone to its Centre.</HI></P>
