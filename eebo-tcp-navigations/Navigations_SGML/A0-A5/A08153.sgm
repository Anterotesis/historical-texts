<HEAD>From Hungary, Octob. <HI>28. 1621.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN <HI>Hungary,</HI> affaires goe not very well for <HI>Bethelem Gabor,</HI> and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iagen|dorff,</HI> are already in <HI>Morauia,</HI> and make them&s;elues Ma|&s;ters of the field, winning one place after another with great &s;peedine&s;&s;e: yet neuer|thele&s;&s;e the treaty of <HI>Niclausburgh</HI> goeth forward.</P>
<P>The accord betweene the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is broken off, wherefore the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> followeth him foot by foot.</P>
<P>They in <HI>Franckendale</HI> behaue them&s;elues very braue and manfully, and if other places had done the like, it would not haue beene in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> as it is.</P>
<P>Euen now, I haue newes, that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is ariued at a place called <HI>Necker,</HI> within foure miles of <HI>Heydelberg:</HI> and it is thought that <HI>Franck|endale</HI> will bee aided or &s;uccoured by him, next Munday or Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>At <HI>Newenmarik,</HI> the Ie&s;uites and Capuchines preach openly in the Ca&s;tle, and Pari&s;h Chur|ches.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"><HI>From Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;taw in Sile&s;ia, the</HI> 17 <HI>of Octob.</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>Although the purpo&s;ed Diet in <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> vvas de|ferred by the Lords and States of the Countrey: yet is it appointed againe by the Emperour and Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> that it &s;hall be kept, and begin ere October be fini&s;hed, becau&s;e all manner of prepa|ration belonging thereunto is in a readine&s;&s;e, and already &s;et forward.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iagendorff</HI> was in <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> with 20000. taking one place after another, and &s;o went into <HI>Morauia</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Tra~&s;iluania,</HI> to whom came 10000. of <HI>Walachia,</HI> who &s;poile and burne all they meet withall, &s;o that it is reported, that the&s;e forces together, are very neere 50000. I meane <HI>Be|thelem Gabors,</HI> and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iagendorff.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Glaty</HI> is not as yet taken, but holds out &s;till.</P>
<P>Out of <HI>Poland,</HI> newes is come, that there were &s;laine in the la&s;t conflict betweene them and the <HI>Turkes,</HI> 20000. <HI>Polonians,</HI> and at lea&s;t 40000. <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o certaine, that the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Bran|denburg</HI> ariued in the end of September la&s;t, at <HI>War&s;chan</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> whom the King of <HI>Poland</HI> met, with 500. <HI>Heiduckens,</HI> and many hor&s;emen, and &s;o the &s;aid Marque&s;&s;e very &s;hortly after receiued the feoud of the King.</P>
<P>Out of <HI>Pru&s;sia</HI> the newes is, that the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI> hath taken in <HI>Riga,</HI> or <HI>Rigwe,</HI> and that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> is gone for certaine, as re&s;olued to meete with the <HI>Turkes</HI> armie.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> it is likely it will be very dangerous to liue and continue, and therefore many of them are
<PB N="3" REF="3">
about to buy land in the Country of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> fearing it will fall out very ill with them in their owne Countrey.</P>
<P>The Lord of <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1+ letters">n</HI> is come vnto <HI>Iagendorff,</HI> with 3. Companies of foot, and 4. peeces of Artillery, and &s;o put a Garri&s;on the rein, from whence he went vn|to <HI>Trappaw,</HI> and tooke with him the Ordnance that were in <HI>Iagendorff,</HI> getting a great bootie by the way.</P>
<P>In <HI>Morauia</HI> there is like to be an vprore, and the <HI>Wallachiens</HI> will fall directly to the Marque&s;&s;e, wherupon they &s;u&s;pect the Marque&s;&s;e in the vpper <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> who would march thorow their Countrey with 8000. <HI>Hungars</HI> and 6000. <HI>Dutch,</HI> which hath cau&s;ed a great feare among&s;t the Souldiers on all &s;ides.</P>
<P><HI>From Vienna,</HI> 25. <HI>Octob.</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>After that Captaine <HI>Reuber,</HI> contrary to his oath, had &s;urrendered vp the Towne of <HI>Scalitz, Bethelem Gabor</HI> went forward with his forces all along <HI>Mo|rauia,</HI> and as &s;oone as the Souldiers which lay in <HI>Strafnitz</HI> perceiued his comming, they made them|&s;elues ma&s;ters ouer their Captaines and Comman|ders, hurting and wounding &s;ome of them, e&s;peci|ally one of <HI>Haugenitz</HI> very &s;ore, becau&s;e he would not yeeld vnto them, and afterwards they threw him out at a window.</P>
<P>Thus when they had bound all their Captaines and Commanders, they deliuered them and the Ca&s;tle vp vnto <HI>Bethelem Gabor,</HI> who would haue put them all to the &s;word; but by the meanes of the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iagendorff</HI> they were &s;aued: yet a
<PB N="4" REF="4">
great feare was rai&s;ed in the Countrey by this meanes, that the treaty of <HI>Niclaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">urgh</HI> &s;hould haue beene deferred: but &s;ince there ariued 9000. <HI>Sile&s;ians</HI> in <HI>Morauia,</HI> it is begun.</P>
<P>In the meane time, the <HI>Hungarians</HI> did &s;et vpon <HI>Holl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;chaw,</HI> the Lord Cantilar of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Lord Generall, with their followers, and tooke a|way from them what they had: notwith&s;tanding, the Earle of <HI>Emerid, Titzio,</HI> and fiue other <HI>Hunga|rian</HI> Lords are come vnto the Treatie, and &s;hall (no que&s;tion) haue what the whole country can afford.</P>
<P>Three dayes agoe there was put in pri&s;on heere, an <HI>Italian,</HI> called <HI>Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">la,</HI> with his &s;onne and &s;eruants, for coyning certaine pieces of money, amounting to the value of a thou&s;and pound.</P>
<P><HI>Bethelem Gabor</HI> and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Iagendorff,</HI> haue taken in mo&s;t places on this &s;ide the Mar&s;h, and our forces haue likewi&s;e taken in the be&s;t quar|ters on the other &s;ide all along, till you come to <HI>Randi&s;ch,</HI> where they meane to remaine on both &s;ides, vntill a Treaty of peace is concluded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">lean</HI> forces doe daily great hurt, conti|nuing burning and &s;poiling the Countrey heerea|bout <HI>New&s;tadt:</HI> and although the chiefe places are be&s;et with Souldiers, as <HI>Hanbach, Prugg, Alten|burgh, Ei&s;en&s;tad,</HI> and <HI>New&s;tadt,</HI> yet they dare not venter vpon the enemy, either for feare of di&s;com|fiture, or leauing their Townes naked.</P>
<P>Since our forces left the <HI>Schutt</HI> and <HI>Thombia,</HI> and went into <HI>Morauia,</HI> they haue indured great &s;carci|tie, and &s;till want nece&s;&s;ary proui&s;ion: for the Soul|diers liuing by prouant, and getting none, could
<PB N="5" REF="4">
neither pa&s;&s;e thorow, nor trauell any longer, in&s;o|much that many hor&s;es died for want of prouen|der, and as many Souldiers for want of victuals, &s;o that they are not able to re&s;i&s;t the enemy: be&s;ides, the &s;ickne&s;&s;e &amp; dearth which is increa&s;ed among&s;t them, doth trouble &amp; affright them more &amp; more.</P>
<P><HI>Out of Prage,</HI> 27. <HI>of Octob.</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>They in <HI>Tabor</HI> doe hitherto hold out, and haue only 50. very expert in &s;hooting, &s;o that none dare &s;hew them&s;elues before it: all the forces which are heereabouts, were brought together, being about 4000. foot, and 600. hor&s;e, who &s;hould haue giuen an a&s;&s;ault vpon the Towne, but finding them&s;elues too weake, they de&s;i&s;ted: whereupon they determi|ned to vndermine it: wherein likewi&s;e they failed, by rea&s;on of the &s;ituation vpon a &s;tony and hard ground.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tein</HI> cannot as yet goe for|wards with his regiment of foot, and 500. hor&s;e, becau&s;e all the men which can be mu&s;tered, are brought before <HI>Tabor.</HI> Likewi&s;e the Dukes forces goe not forward, but lye heere and there on the high wayes &s;ide, robbing and &s;tealing from all they meet: and although the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> hath beene called vpon diuers times by the Emperor to march with his Army into <HI>Morauia:</HI> yet for any thing we heare, he is not &s;o much as a going.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> all this while are falne very &s;trong into <HI>Morauia,</HI> doing very much hurt, and al|though the <HI>Imperials</HI> follow them, to intercept their outrage, yet are they too weake to doe any good vpon them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">The Prince of <HI>Lichten&s;tein</HI> went ye&s;terday in the forenoone with a few toward <HI>Rundis,</HI> where the Arch-duke <HI>Charles</HI> is to meet him.</P>
<P><HI>From Neurenbergh, Octob.</HI> 26. 1621.</P>
<P>On Sunday la&s;t, there pa&s;&s;ed by vs <HI>Mon&s;ieur Tilly</HI> with 66. companies of foot, 44. troopes of hor&s;e, 9. Peeces of Ordnance, 1500. waines, and 5000. hor&s;e|men, all which went pre&s;ently to <HI>Furth,</HI> where they pitched their Campe and re&s;olued to remaine.</P>
<P>Hitherto they haue had proui&s;ion &s;ent vnto them from hence; they did much hurt by the way, and terrified all the Countrey: Whether he followed with this Army after the Count of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who then lay at <HI>Rottenbergh,</HI> is vncertaine, becau&s;e they &s;uddenly incamped, as (belike) vnder&s;tanding of a new Treaty betweene the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> and the Count <HI>Mansfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From the Palatinate, the</HI> 26. <HI>of Octob.</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ritter&s;chaft</HI> lieth as yet at <HI>Neckerhan&s;en,</HI> and thereabouts.</P>
<P>The enemy before <HI>Franckendale,</HI> hath got the halfe moone by <HI>Raldenlech</HI> already, and they haue beene vpon the wall at <HI>Franckendale,</HI> but were for|ced to a retreat by the valour of the defendants&punc; they looke daily for Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who as it is thought, will quarter him&s;elfe about <HI>Masbach,</HI> and then no doubt, as &s;oone as he comes, <HI>Franckendale</HI> will be aided and releeued.</P>
<P>La&s;t Friday there was a skirmi&s;h betwixt the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Captaine <HI>Obertrant,</HI> who carried away with him three Peeces of Ordnance, leauing the fourth in the lurch: all the&s;e he took from them very brauely.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5">At <HI>Manhaime</HI> the enemy would haue taken the Ship-bridge avvay, but they vvere beaten backe a|gaine vvith no &s;mall lo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;t Saterday the enemy made another &s;trong a&s;&s;ault vpon the Sconce before <HI>Franckendale,</HI> vvherein the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lay, but vvere beaten off a|gaine vvith the lo&s;&s;e of 700. men, vvhereof &s;ome of them &s;tucke &s;o fa&s;t in the mari&s;h, that they vvere there cut in pieces. There is a rumor that the Earle of <HI>Nedery&s;enburgh</HI> vvas &s;laine vvith a Peece of Ordnance: &s;ome &s;ay he vvas but hurt: but it is &s;ure, that certaine chiefe Captaines vvere &s;laine in that a&s;&s;ault. About midnight they made another a&s;|&s;ault vpon the halfe Moone, and tooke it vvith tvvo Peeces of Ordnance, tvvo tunne of povvder, vvith certaine clothes: but ere they could goe quite a|way, all was recouered, and they lo&s;t againe many men, be&s;ides 300. that were wounded. There were found dead of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ome 80. but it is vncer|taine how many they brought into the Towne with them.
