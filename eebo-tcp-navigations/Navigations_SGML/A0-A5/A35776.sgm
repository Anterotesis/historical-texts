<P>THis Town being now the <HI>Key,</HI> or <HI>Inlet</HI> to <HI>Dublin</HI> from the North, and as well for that rea&s;on, as for its Fortifications and natural &s;trength, the mo&s;t important Garri&s;on in the whole Kingdom; the &s;ubduing of which gains <HI>Dublin,</HI> and con&s;equently the be&s;t part of <HI>Ireland;</HI> on which account it has been the de&s;ire of the mo&s;t Curious to know the Scituation and Strength of this impor|tant Place. <HI>Tredagh</HI> (for its Antiquity) is the fir&s;t Corporation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the Metroplis <HI>Dublin</HI> it &s;elf: It being an Ancient Prerogative, when the Major of <HI>Tredagh</HI> is Cho&s;en, to di&s;patch a Hor&s;e|man with all Expedition to the Lord Mayor and Court of Alderman then A&s;|&s;embled in the <HI>Tol&s;all,</HI> to acquaint them that the Mayor of <HI>Tredagh</HI> is Cho&s;en, up|on which immediately the Lord Mayor of <HI>Dublin</HI> is Sworn the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>It &s;tands in the Province of <HI>&V;l&s;ter</HI> in the County of <HI>Louth,</HI> on the River of <HI>Boyn,</HI> on the Mouth of the &s;aid River running full on the Sea, and within twenty Miles of <HI>Dublin</HI> by Land: The River <HI>Boyn</HI> di|vides it as the <HI>Thames</HI> does <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Southwark,</HI> or as the <HI>Liffy</HI> does <HI>O&s;tman-Town</HI> and <HI>Dublin.</HI> It has over it a &s;pacious Bridge with Nine Arches and Pillars, and a very Commodious Haven, in which Ships of the greate&s;t Burthen may ly at Anchor; and Merchant-men of two or three hundred Tun &s;ail up to the Key.</P>
<P>It took the name of <HI>Droghedah</HI> from the Bridge, which (to the wonder of the Natives) was built over the River. <HI>Drohed,</HI> in the Iri&s;h Language &s;ignifying a Bridge or Pa&s;&s;age over the Water, &s;ince by the Engli&s;h, <HI>Dredagh,</HI> now generally <HI>Tredagh.</HI></P>
<P>It is a very Fair, Rich, and Popolous City, famous for all &s;orts of Commerce and Traffick, both by Sea and Land: This is evident by the richne&s;s of their Mer|chants and Trade&s;men, &s;ome of whom are valued Twenty, &s;ome Thirty, &s;ome Forty thou&s;ands pounds <HI>Sterlin.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;trongly Fortified as well by Art as Nature, having round it a &s;trong Wall of 6 Foot, in &s;ome Places 7 Foot deep, with a Ba&s;tion at every Corner, be&s;ides &s;everal Terrets, or Towers, with &s;mall Cannons mounted on the &s;aid Towers, and two Demilunes, or Half-moons, on each &s;ide of the Town, on each of which, are planted Four Demiculverins: And two Plat-forms to the Water-&s;ide, with as many great Cannons.</P>

<P>There are &s;everal other very large and &s;pacious Streets, as <HI>Dear-&s;treet,</HI> on the Left-hand at the Upper-end of the great Street, where &s;tands the <HI>Tol&s;all,</HI> which is an Ancient and Curious Structure, the Seat of Judicature, and Place of their publick A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P><HI>Bridges-&s;treet</HI> on the other-&s;ide the Bridge, upon which is built the Town-Jayl, called <HI>Guild hall,</HI> over the <HI>Boyn,</HI> be|&s;ides <HI>Alleys, Courts,</HI> and <HI>Lanes,</HI> innumer|able.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s by <HI>Shop-&s;treet,</HI> which is the mo&s;t eminent and remarkable for Mer|chants, there are two Famous <HI>Keys, Savi|ours</HI> and <HI>Merchants Key,</HI> upon which is built the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Burs,</HI> or <HI>Ex|change.</HI></P>
<P>There were once as many large Churches as Streets, mo&s;t of which were Demo|li&s;hed in the time of the War: There yet remains the Famous Church of St. <HI>Peters,</HI> well beautified and kept in its Primative &s;plendor; and St. <HI>Johns</HI> Church in St. <HI>Johns</HI> Street, which are the only two Churches endow'd, and a <HI>Chappel</HI> of Ea&s;e allowed to St. <HI>Peters,</HI> tell St. <HI>Lawrance</HI> Church be built. There is likewi&s;e a large <HI>Convention</HI> or Meeting-hou&s;e on <HI>Sa|viours Key.</HI> The <HI>Popi&s;h Chappel</HI> in <HI>We&s;t-&s;treet</HI> is pull'd down.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what has been mention'd, there is yet one thing more remarkable called the <HI>Mill Mount,</HI> which being in the Cen|tre of the Town, Commanding the Coun|trey 6. or 7. Miles round every way, &s;o that if this place were but well Built and Fortified, it would make the Town Inac|ce&s;&s;able and almo&s;t Impregniable: The Neglect of this Fortification gave <HI>O. Crom|well</HI> &s;uch &s;peedy and ea&s;y Acce&s;s into that Garri&s;on, who reduced it in a weeks time, which the Wild Iri&s;h could hardly do in 3. Years.</P>
<P>This &s;uce&s;sfull Conqueror Marched out of <HI>Dublin</HI> with a Detatchment of 10000 Cho&s;en Men the 30th. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1649 with a Train of Artillery and 4. Whole, and 5. Demy Cannnons, Sir. <HI>George A&s;|cough</HI> with his Fleet blocking them up by &s;ea, He came before <HI>Droghedah,</HI> on the 2d. of <HI>September.</HI> Where (without the Ceremonies of Drawing Lines, or Make|ing Trenches, the U&s;ual formalites of a Seige, he pre&s;ently planted a &s;trong Bat|tery, which Quickly levelled the Steeple of a Church on the &s;outh-&s;ide of the Town, and a Tower by it, which Battery con|triving (with the Fleet Blocking them up by &s;ea) the 9th. of the &s;ame Month (which was within a weeks time) he be|came ma&s;ter of the place, having taken it by &s;torm, and put all to the &s;word, to the Number of above 3000. We doubt not but the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s will attend the no le&s;s Victorious General his Grace the D, of <HI>Schomberg</HI> in this pre&s;ent undertaking and thee Speedy Reducing of this Important place, which will prove for effectual an Inlett to the Subduing the whole Na|tion.</P>
