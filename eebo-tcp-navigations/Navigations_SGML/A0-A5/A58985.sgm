<HEAD><HI>A</HI> SECOND NARRATIVE <HI>of the SIGNAL VICTORY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_HIS <HI>Royal Highne&s;s,</HI> after his Return from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> where he had lain before the <HI>Texell,</HI> taken their Merchants Ships, and u&s;ed all po&s;sible means to provoke the <HI>Dutch</HI> to a Battle, having certain Intelli|gence, not only that the <HI>Dutch Fleet</HI> had taken the Sea, but that they publiquely declared their intentions of &s;eeking out the <HI>Engli&s;h Fleet;</HI> and farther, that the <HI>Good Hope</HI> with their <HI>Convoys</HI> from <HI>Ham|burgh</HI> had unfortunately fallen into their hands, judging that all the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances might tend to the di&s;reputa|tion of His Maje&s;ties Affairs, became very impatient of all delays; and though many of the Provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>Fleet</HI> were not yet on board, His <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> re&s;olved to carry the <HI>Fleet</HI> from the <HI>Gunfleet</HI> near <HI>Harwich</HI> to <HI>Sowld Bay,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3">and there to take in the remainder of vi|ctuals and other &s;tores; that being a more open place, and therefore more proper for going out to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> in ca&s;e they &s;hould attempt to make any <HI>Bravado</HI> up|on the <HI>Engli&s;h Coa&s;t.</HI> In pro&s;ecution there|fore of that Re&s;olution, the <HI>Fleet</HI> weigh|ed anchor at high water on the 30 of <HI>May</HI> (carrying with them the <HI>victualling &s;hips</HI> and other &s;tores) the wind being at <HI>South Ea&s;t,</HI> but it did not long continue &s;o, but <HI>veered</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t, Ea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t North-ea&s;t,</HI> &s;o that we were forced to &s;top Tydes, and u&s;ing all our endevors we could not arrive at <HI>Sowld Bay</HI> til <HI>June</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> about 6 in the <HI>morning,</HI> where we anchored about 5 miles from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Twelve</HI> and <HI>One</HI> of the clock this day, his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> being at din|ner, news was brought that a great <HI>Fleet</HI> was di&s;covered to the <HI>Ea&s;t, South-ea&s;t</HI> of us, about &s;ome <HI>&s;ix leagues</HI> off, which con|cluding
<PB N="5" REF="3">to be the <HI>Dutch,</HI> his <HI>Royal High|ne&s;s</HI> ordered the <HI>Victuallers</HI> to <HI>Harwich,</HI> and the <HI>Fleet</HI> to <HI>weigh,</HI> and to get farther off the &s;hore, which was done according|ly till the Flood; when we came again to an anchor, the <HI>Dutch</HI> kept under Sail, and endevoured to keep to the <HI>South-ea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t</HI> of us. At <HI>Ten</HI> of the clock <HI>that night,</HI> we weighed anchor again, the wind being at <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> We did our be&s;t to get up to the <HI>Dutch Fleet,</HI> but they being to windward of us, it did not depend up|on our choice, &s;o that the <HI>Dutch</HI> keeping upon a wind, in the <HI>morning, June</HI> 2. we &s;aw them about 5 <HI>leagues South ea&s;t</HI> from us, the wind varying from the <HI>South ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>South South-ea&s;t, South</HI> and <HI>South South-we&s;t.</HI> At <HI>eight</HI> in the <HI>Evening Lestoff</HI> bore <HI>North-we&s;t</HI> about <HI>eight leagues</HI> off, and the <HI>Dutch Fleet</HI> was then about 3 <HI>leagues</HI> off, &s;tanding off with their <HI>Star-board</HI> Tacks on <HI>board,</HI> and we &s;tood after them, but they &s;tayed not for us.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>There was a great de&s;ire in the <HI>Fleet</HI> to have engaged the <HI>Dutch this day,</HI> which had <HI>twelve years &s;ince</HI> been &s;o fortunate to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t the <HI>&s;ame Enemy;</HI> what other rea&s;on, be&s;ides the ill fortune of that day, the <HI>Dutch</HI> could have to decline the fighting us, then when they might have had the wind of us, we can neither con|jecture, nor learn from any of the Pri&s;o|ners &s;ince taken. <HI>This Evening</HI> one of the Enemies <HI>Sternmo&s;t Ships</HI> was <HI>fired,</HI> &s;ome of our men per&s;waded them&s;elves it was one of their <HI>Admirals,</HI> but we &s;ince under|&s;tand by Pri&s;oners it was one of their <HI>Fire&s;hips,</HI> which took fire before her time by the drunkenne&s;s of her Commander: Whatever it was, our men believed the be&s;t, and as it was no &s;mall joy to &s;ee an Enemies Ship &s;o ea&s;ily de&s;troyed; &s;o they took it for a <HI>good Omen</HI> of a <HI>future Victory.</HI></P>
<P>This night we kept &s;ight of the <HI>Enemy</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="4">all night, and the wind <HI>veering</HI> to the <HI>South-we&s;t,</HI> between <HI>two</HI> and <HI>three</HI> of the clock in the <HI>morning, June</HI> 3. we lay to <HI>weather</HI> of the <HI>Dutch Fleet,</HI> which they perceiving, tacked and &s;tood with us, but could not <HI>weather us;</HI> being as we &s;uppo&s;e about <HI>fourteen leagues</HI> from <HI>Le&s;toffe, South-ea&s;t &s;outherly.</HI> At half an hour pa&s;t <HI>three</HI> in the <HI>morning</HI> the Battle began: <HI>Prince Ruperts Squadron</HI> having the <HI>Van,</HI> and of that Squadron <HI>Vice-Admiral Mings;</HI> His <HI>Royal Highne&s;&s;e's</HI> Squadron was in the <HI>Body,</HI> and that of the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the <HI>Rear:</HI> The fir&s;t &s;alutes the <HI>Dutch</HI> re|ceived from <HI>Prince Rupert</HI>'s Squadron, (animated by the example as well as or|ders of that valiant Prince) made them doubt whether the victory over the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> were either &s;o certain, or &s;o ea&s;ie, as the <HI>Heer de Wit;</HI> and their other Coun|try-men who were to &s;tay at home, had per&s;waded them, <HI>Both Fleets</HI> having pa&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="8" REF="5">thus by one the other in a Line, there was for a con&s;iderable time a perfect quiet without &s;hooting one Gun; About <HI>&s;ix</HI> of the clock, we tacked, and &s;tood to the <HI>We&s;t, North-we&s;t;</HI> and they to the <HI>South, South-east,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed by one the other, there being again an intermi&s;sion from &s;hooting; Upon this Tack, the <HI>Dutch</HI> endeavoured to get the wind of us which they hoped to have done, which his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> fore&s;eeing, they would endevour, kept &s;o clo&s;e to the wind, that when the <HI>Dutch tacked,</HI> hoping to <HI>weather Prince Rupert,</HI> they found his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> to <HI>weather</HI> them, and therefore rather then pa&s;s between <HI>two</HI> Lines of our <HI>Fleet,</HI> they cho&s;e to bear to <HI>Leeward</HI> of <HI>Prince Rupert.</HI> We &s;tood not long that way, but his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> ordered the <HI>Reer</HI> of His <HI>Maje&s;ties Fleet</HI> to <HI>tack</HI> fir&s;t, that &s;o we might the better and &s;ooner get up with the <HI>headmo&s;t</HI> of <HI>their Fleet.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>This was not done without &s;ome intermix|ture of the Ships of the &s;everal Squadrons; but yet without any con&s;iderable prejudice. This being executed, his <HI>Royall Highne&s;s</HI> making Sail with his <HI>Squadron,</HI> he came to be the <HI>Headmo&s;t Squadron</HI> of the Line, and had Sir <HI>John Law&s;on,</HI> with &s;ome other Ships of his Squadron a head of him, with which keeping up to the <HI>Headmo&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Enemies</HI> Ships, we kept them to <HI>Leeward</HI> of us, and never &s;uffered them to tack, but kept the wind of them the whole day. The Fight continued long, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> made very con|&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance: but it was ob&s;erved, That as we bore in upon them, they altered their cour&s;e, &s;o that whereas they might have layn up <HI>South South-ea&s;t,</HI> they bore off to the <HI>Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t.</HI> His <HI>Royall Highne&s;s</HI> who had ob&s;erved in the beginning of the Battle, the endeavour of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to get the wind, and by what means it was prevented, and al&s;o the g eat benefit we had by it, by &s;ecuring us again&s;t the Enemies <HI>Fire-&s;hips,</HI> (in which they had placed a great part of their hopes) had always a regard to the keeping that advantage which God had &s;o fa|vourably given us; which with the concurrence of another accident, did &s;omewhat prolong the <HI>Battel.</HI> The continual &s;moak would not give
<PB N="10" REF="6">us leave to &s;ee very far before us what the Ene|my did; and therefore the Actions of <HI>Others,</HI> were in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be the guide even of the <HI>Admiral:</HI> his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> therefore ha|ving &s;een Sir <HI>John Law&s;on</HI> with his accu&s;tomed Valour bear in towards the Enemies Line, but &s;oon after to edge off again to windward, con|cluded that Sir <HI>John Law&s;on</HI> had &s;een &s;ome of the Enemies Ships endeavouring to get the Wind of us, and therefore to prevent That, his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> kept near the Wind, which was a guide to the whole Fleet. But this mi&s;take was under&s;tood a little while after, by a Me&s;|&s;ake from Sir <HI>John Law&s;on,</HI> who privately &s;ent to give his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> an accompt <HI>that he was hurt,</HI> and for that time uncapable of &s;ervice, <HI>(though, thanks be to God, without danger of life)</HI> &s;o that we perceived the Working his Ship, which led us into that Errour, <HI>was through the want of their Commander,</HI> the Ma&s;ter being al&s;o hurt. His <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> therefore ordered Captain <HI>Jordon</HI> to go on board the <HI>Royal Oak;</HI> after which <HI>She</HI> did excellent good &s;ervice. This Error being now perceived, and about the &s;ame time <HI>Opdams</HI> Ship (which was known by a <HI>Pendant</HI> under his <HI>Flagg</HI>) coming up to lie almo&s;t oppo&s;ite <HI>in their Line</HI> to his <HI>Royal High|ne&s;s</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="6">Ship in <HI>Ours;</HI> His <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> was plea|&s;ed to give command to bear up to him, &s;ay|ing, <HI>He would him&s;elf have a Bout with</HI> Opdam, (for &s;o he termed it.) In which being obey'd, and the whole Fleet taking example by the working of his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> Ship, we began to ply our Guns at &s;o near a di&s;tance, that the Enemy began to &s;hrink apace, though not ab|&s;olutely to run. Whil&s;t things were in this condition, it plea&s;ed God (who had through the whole Conduct of this great Bu&s;ine&s;s won|derfully favoured us) by an extraordinary O|peration of his Almighty hand to facilitate our Work; and to &s;horten the danger to which his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> had re&s;olved to expo&s;e his own Per&s;on, by the <HI>blowing up of Opdams Ship;</HI> which as it was a great joy to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o it could not but infinitely di&s;courage the <HI>Enemy,</HI> who did not &s;tand long after, but (we bearing in upon them, pre&s;ently fled, we following them, and taking and burning their Ships until night; when not being able to do any more &s;ervice up|on them, we onely endeavoured to keep &s;o much &s;ight of them, as to be up with them in the morning, when we again followed the pur&s;uit (taking divers of their Ships) unto the very mouth of the <HI>Texel,</HI> where their Ships getting
<PB N="12" REF="7">into Shoal water, and being perfectly acquain|ted with the place, we dur&s;t not adventure &s;o near the &s;hore with our Ships, which were not in condition to bear much Sail, if there &s;hould have been need for bringing them off again. We &s;taid in &s;ight of the <HI>Texel</HI> till we &s;aw their Ships go in which they did not neglect to do the fir&s;t Tide.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Battle, two of our Ships, not being able to <HI>weather</HI> the <HI>Enemy,</HI> fell into their Fleet; the <HI>One</HI> (which was the <HI>Cha|rity,</HI> a Ship taken from the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the la&s;t War) tacked, hoping thereby to help her &s;elf, but was taken; the <HI>Other</HI> a <HI>Merchant Ship</HI> in the Kings Service, called the <HI>John and Abigal.</HI> Captain <HI>Jo&s;eph Saunders, Commander,</HI> finding him&s;elf a|mong&s;t them, re&s;olved to &s;tand the &s;ame way with our own Fleet, and to receive the Enemies Broad&s;ides, which he had &s;o near, as with them to receive their Threats al&s;o, and was honored with a Broad&s;ide from <HI>Opdams</HI> own Ship, and a <HI>Vice-Admiral,</HI> betwixt which he lay: but the Enemy was too much in na&s;te to attend one &s;in|gle Ship; &s;o that with a con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;e of Men, and the battering of his <HI>Ship, Ma&s;ts, Rig|ging,</HI> and <HI>Sails,</HI> he came &s;afe to his Maje&s;ties Fleet. During the Battle; there came in to us three of his <HI>Maje&s;ties Ships</HI> returned from the
<PB N="13" REF="7"><HI>Sound,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Leopard</HI> from <HI>Harwich:</HI> To the <HI>Dutch</HI> came <HI>young Evert&s;on</HI> with <HI>three Ships.</HI></P>
<P>To give an account of the particular Actions of his Maje&s;ties Commanders, would be not onely tedious, but prove injurious to many; who&s;e merits would &s;eem le&s;s, if not named; nor would it be le&s;s injurious to all tho&s;e who have done well, (if any Actions were to be particularized) not to name (with reproach) tho&s;e who have been wanting to their Duty. Let it therefore &s;uffice for an evidence of the bravery of his Maje&s;ties Commanders in general, that the <HI>Invicible Dutch Fleet</HI> is by them <HI>overcome;</HI> though I will not conceal from you, that I hear it &s;aid, his <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> doth not think it &s;ufficient that they do bet|ter then the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l expect that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">ll do as be|cometh <HI>Engli&s;h men;</HI> and therefore it is thought, this occa|&s;ion having made &s;ome di&s;covery of the tempers of &s;ome men, who could not be known b fore, &s;ome <HI>alterations</HI> will be even among&s;t the <HI>Victorious:</HI> for the generally of the <HI>Engli&s;h Seamen,</HI> it is certain, that greater of more valiant hearts are not to be found in any Race of men; nor more indefatigable: of which a greater in&s;tance could not be, then this Battle, which was of &s;uch continuance, that if &s;eparated from the <HI>labour,</HI> the <HI>danger</HI> alone would have been in&s;upportable to any other &s;ort of men; and perhaps would have been &s;o to them al&s;o, had not the danger awakened their courages, and re-doubled their &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Having told you of a Ship of his Maje&s;ties lo&s;t; if I &s;hould give over here, you might think we had lo&s;t by the Victory; and there|fore it is nece&s;&s;ary to give you &s;ome account
<PB N="14" REF="8">of the <HI>Enemies Lo&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Our Gain;</HI> which ne|verthele&s;s, in the pre&s;ent uncertainty; you mu&s;t give me leave to do as Accomptants u&s;e, with a <HI>re&s;erve</HI> of <HI>(errors excepted)</HI> endeavouring not|with&s;tanding &s;o far as maybe, to tell you nothing for certain which is not &s;o. Fir&s;t, Then you mu&s;t know, that be&s;ides <HI>Opdams</HI> Ship (which we &s;aw blown up, and be&s;ides, have since &s;poken with &s;ome of the Men which were &s;aved) There was taken, and afterwards fired (that &s;o &s;he might not clog us in the pur&s;uit) the <HI>Orange Tree,</HI> a Ship of 76. <HI>Guns.</HI> There were after|wards four of their Ships, in the pur&s;uit, fell foul the one of the other, and were by one of his Maje&s;ties <HI>Fire Ships</HI> &s;et on fire, one of them was the Ship <HI>Couverden,</HI> in which was <HI>Tromps Vice Admiral, Gillis Ty&s;&s;e Campen,</HI> carrying 60. <HI>Guns, The Prince Maurice, Cap. de Clerk,</HI> car|rying 50. <HI>Guns; The Stodt &V;trecht, Cap. Ou|dart,</HI> 44 <HI>Guns;</HI> And a fourth, which was, I think, called the <HI>Stedan,</HI> carrying about 40. <HI>Guns:</HI> After the&s;e were all on fire, and our Ships pa&s;&s;ed by, one of them burning to her Powder, blew up, and with the bla&s;t, blew a|way all the <HI>Rigging, Ma&s;ts, &amp;c.</HI> of one of them of about 40. <HI>Guns,</HI> which was on fire, and &s;o enabled &s;ome of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who remained there
<PB N="15" REF="8">to quench the fire, and fave the Ship, at lea&s;t to pre&s;erve their own lives till &s;ome of their Ships pa&s;&s;ed that way; but whether they towed Her into Harbour; or not, we know not: An acci|dent very extraordinary, and which it was not rea&s;onable to expect or provide again&s;t. This was obterved by &s;ome of the Boats and Ketches which were &s;ent to &s;ave the lives of the poor men, who were left to the two unmerciful Ele|ments. A little after this, were likewi&s;e burned by another Fire-&s;hip, three Ships which were faln foul one of another, the one called <HI>Ma&s;&s;ee|ven, Jacob Row&s;e Commander,</HI> of 78 <HI>Guns,</HI> the <HI>Ter|goes,</HI> of 34 <HI>Guns,</HI> and <HI>Cap. Cuypers</HI> Ship of 30 <HI>Guns.</HI></P>
<P>Of Ships taken, am not able to give you a perfect account, in regard &s;ome are (as we hear) gone directly for <HI>England,</HI> and others not yet come to the Fleet: Some of the Ships taken, are,

<P>We hear of others taken by other Ships, of which we have not the Names, but do conclude, we have de&s;troyed them 23, or 24 Men of <HI>War,</HI> at the lea&s;t; by the next you &s;hall have a more perfect account.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="9">
<P>According to what we learn from the Pri&s;oners, there were &s;lain of the <HI>Dutch Commanders</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ote (be&s;ides <HI>Opdam</HI>) <HI>Cortenaer, Stelling werf, Schram;</HI> and (mo&s;t &s;ay) <HI>Tromp:</HI> but for the certainty of this, the Curious mu&s;t expect Letters from <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On Our Part,</HI> were &s;lath the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Marlebrough, Rear Admiral San&s;um, Captain Able&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Captain Kirbye, Commanders;</HI> Of <HI>Voluntiers</HI> of Note, fell the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Portland, Earl</HI> of <HI>Falmouth, Lord Mu&s;|kery,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> &s;econd Son to the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Burlington.</HI> (The <HI>Three la&s;t</HI> by one fatal &s;hot) I cannot find that the <HI>Dutch Commanders</HI> taken, can give any exact account of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">he number of Ships in their Fleet, that which they &s;eem mo&s;t per&s;wa|ded of, is, That they had about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">0 <HI>Sail</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Fire-&s;hips.</HI> I believe the Kings Fleet was &s;tithin very few of 100 <HI>Sail;</HI> a force worthy on either &s;ide to contend for &s;o great a Stake.</P>
<P>The number of Men <HI>killed</HI> and <HI>taken</HI> from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> I conjecture may be about 8000.
