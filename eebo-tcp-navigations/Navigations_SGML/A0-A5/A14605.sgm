<HEAD>&para; Certaine whole&s;ome Ob&s;eruations and Rules fo Jnne-keepers, and al&s;o for their Gue&s;ts, meet to be fixed vpon the wall of euery Chamber in the hou&s;e; but meant more &s;pecially for the good of M^r. <HI>Henry Hunter</HI> and his wife, of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> his louing brother and &s;i&s;ter, and of the Gue&s;ts which v&s;e their hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. _WE Reade of Inkeepers that they were of ancient time, as in <HI>Io&s;.</HI> 2. <HI>Iudg.</HI> 19. ver&s;e. 21. 22.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Sauiour in the Go&s;pel commends the v&s;e of Innes. <HI>Luke</HI> 10. ver. 34. and brought to an Inne.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yea Chri&s;t him&s;elfe by his owne pre&s;ence did &s;anctifie the v&s;e of Innes by eating his pa&s;&s;eouer there. <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. In <HI>Acts</HI> 28. there is expre&s;&s;e mention of an Inne with approbation and liking. They came to meet vs at the market of <HI>Appius,</HI> and at the three Tauerns.</P>
<P N="5">5 Common experience &s;heweth all men what v&s;e there is of Innes for ca&s;e of Trauailers, that their bodies which are the members of Chri&s;t, and Temples of the holy gho&s;t appointed to a glorious re&s;urrection, may be refre&s;hed after weari&s;ome labour.</P>
<P N="6">6 It mu&s;t not be accounted a &s;mall matter to affoord hou&s;e roome, lodging, re&s;t and food to the comforts of Gods children.</P>

<HEAD>Rules for Innekeepers.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THough your hou&s;e (as an Inne) bee open for all men to come vnto, yet account hone&s;t men your be&s;t gue&s;ts: euer hold their company better then their roomes.</P>
<P N="2">2 Among&s;t hone&s;t men, let &s;uch as be religious withal, be mo&s;t welcome. The feet of the Saints are ble&s;&s;ed, and often leaue ble&s;sings behind them, as we read of <HI>Io&s;eph. Gen.</HI> 39. 4. 5.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of religious and godly men let faithfull Mini&s;ters haue heartie&s;t intertainement. The feet of &s;uch as bring glad tidings of peace and good things, oh how beautiful are they. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. Such as receiue a Prophet in the name of a Prophet &s;hal haue a Prophets reward. <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. Be not &s;o glad of your gain&punc; as that you may plea&s;ure &s;uch.</P>
<P N="4">4 Becau&s;e your gue&s;ts be Gods children, and their bodies the members of Chri&s;t, let their v&s;age for meat, lodg|ing, diet, and &s;leepe bee &s;uch as becomes &s;uch; worthy per&s;onages, as bee heires with God, euen fellow heires&punc; with Chri&s;t. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. In &s;eruing and louing your gue&s;ts, remember you do &s;erue and loue God, who takes all as done to him&s;elfe, which for his &s;ake is done to his. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 34. 33. 36.</P>
<P N="6">6. Content your &s;elues with an hone&s;t gaine, &s;o v&s;ing your gue&s;ts as they may haue an appetite to returne to you when they are gone from you.</P>
<P N="7">7 Make choice of good &s;eruants, &s;uch as know God and make con&s;cience of their waies: for the&s;e are likelie&s;t to be true, faithfull, diligent, and cheerefull in their &s;eruice; al&s;o &s;uch will be&s;t plea&s;e your be&s;t gue&s;ts, and will not iu&s;tly offend your wor&s;t. Moreouer, God will cau&s;e your bu&s;ines to pro&s;per be&s;t in the hands of &s;uch.</P>
<P N="8">8. Giue your &s;eruants no euill example in word or deed, beare not with their lying, deceit, &s;wearing, propha|ning of the Sabbath, or wantonnes. Cau&s;e them to keepe the Lords day holy, going to the Church by turnes: ex|amine them how they profit by Sermons; loue &s;uch &s;eruants be&s;t, as mo&s;t loue Gods word.</P>

<HEAD>Rules for Gue&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. VSe an Inne not as your owne hou&s;e, but as an Inne; not to dwell in but to re&s;t for &s;uch time as ye haue iu&s;t and needfull occa&s;ion and then to returne to your owne families.</P>
<P N="2">2. Remember ye are in the world as in an Inne to tarry for a &s;hort &s;pace; and then to be gone hence.</P>
<P N="3">3. At night when ye come to your Inne thanke God for your Pre&s;eruation: next morning pray for a good Iourney.</P>
<P N="4">4. Eat and drinke for nece&s;sity and &s;trength, and not for lu&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. At table let your talke be powdred with the &s;alt of heauenly wi&s;edome, as your meat is &s;ea&s;oned with mate|rial and earthly &s;alt.</P>
<P N="6">6. Aboue all abhorre all oathes, cur&s;ing and bla&s;phemy, for God will not hold him guiltle&s;&s;e which taketh his name in vaine.</P>
