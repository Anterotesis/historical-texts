<P>Fir&s;t, that whereas they expected the comming downe of <HI>Moun&s;eur Tilley</HI> out of the Palatinate, the Letters came to Bru&s;&s;els to the contrary, that con&s;ide|ring they intended the &s;iege of Manheim, and that many towns in the Bi&s;hoprick of Spiers and Worms, would not yeeld to <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> he could not be &s;pared; be&s;ides; the Germans were loath (winter coming on) to take &s;o long a iourney, after their great toyle, but cried out already for re&s;t, and a Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the towne of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> from whence they had their greate&s;t &s;uppliment, was al|mo&s;t weary of the warre, and beganne to finde fault with the enterprize, either that <HI>Spinola</HI> had ouerpri|zed him&s;elfe in a pre&s;umptuous re&s;olution to get the towne, or vnderualued the States, as weake and vn|able to re&s;i&s;t the forces; or was not well informed of the &s;trength and &s;ituation of the place.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that the &s;laughters were &s;o great of his armies, and decay of his &s;ouldiers, that although it might be pa&s;&s;ed ouer with the chance of warre, and malignity of circum&s;tances, yet time would con&s;ume them more and more; and which way could the wit of man inuent how other Souldiers &s;hould come for|ward, as their enemies lay to affront them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that the wants of the Campe were in|tolerable, as enduring famine, and cold, euen to the
<PB N="29" REF="16">
eating of hor&s;es, yea many other inconueniences which mu&s;t needs be aggrauated and increa&s;ed both with the time, and diuers other circum&s;tances, where|in they &s;aw no preven&s;ion, as the ca&s;e now &s;tood.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, that if the States armies were ray&s;ed, then would the Prince of <HI>Orenge</HI> lye on one &s;ide, and <HI>Count Mansfield</HI> on the other, who meant not to fight with them but when they li&s;t, and then vpon great ad|uantage, but were &s;ure to con&s;ume them, and weary them out, or torment them with daily eruptions and encombrances, and that without any manner of pre|uention.</P>
<P>All which con&s;idered, the Councell thought it meet by one meanes or other to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and ra|ther &s;aue the liues of &s;o many braue men, who might in &s;ome other proiect, and at &s;ome other time reco|uer this lo&s;&s;e, and reintegrate their fortunes; then to endure a certaine de&s;truction, and irrecouerable wret|chedne&s;&s;e; and although the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Spinola</HI> obie|cted, that his honour was &s;o farre ingaged, that he had rather peri&s;h in the misfortune, then endure the indi|gnity of being thus di&s;appointed; yet they an&s;wered, nece&s;&s;ity was a commanding mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, and there was no with&s;tanding of Fate and De&s;tiny, yea there was iudgement and rea&s;on in enduring &s;ome inconuenien|ces, rather then a mi&s;chiefe or a&s;&s;ured de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As for the honour hee enterpo&s;ed, what was it more to him, then to the former Duke of Par|ma, who had rai&s;ed his &s;iege in the &s;ame place, after hee had layen there with 32000. men almo&s;t halfe a yeare: yea the great Turke went from Vienna and Malta, di&s;appointed; and diuers other Princes haue

<HEAD>THE MANNER OF The rai&s;ing of the Siege of <HI>BERGEN</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHereas a little before, the Letters make mention, that his Excellency the <HI>Prince of Orenge,</HI> with <HI>Count Mansfield,</HI> the <HI>Duke of Brun&s;wick,</HI> and their Forces had a purpo&s;e to diuide them&s;elues and blocke vp <HI>Spinola</HI> in his Trenches, and as it were &s;et downe the manner of their marches, if they &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e indeed, and how they would quarter them&s;elues: the truth is, they did onely capitulate the matter, but not put it in execution, as eyther pre|uented by <HI>Spinola's</HI> couert e&s;cape, or the adui&s;e of the States, who they &s;ay came to Dort for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, and to whom his Excellencie with &s;ome &s;peciall Commanders re&s;orted</P>
<P>But this was not &s;o effectually done, but that Her Highne&s;&s;e at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> had notice of the &s;ame iu&s;t in a manner at the &s;ame time as Letters came from <HI>Baua|ria,</HI> that <HI>Moun&s;eur Tilly</HI> could not be &s;pared out of the Palatinate: Whereupon, when &s;he con&s;idered the

danger eminent and imminent, and in what perill her whole Army &s;tood, (be&s;ides the infinite inconueni|ences it was &s;ubiect vnto, as you haue heard) if the Prince of Orenge &s;hould come one way with his Forces, and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;|wicke</HI> another way with their Armies, &s;he very con&s;i|derately adui&s;ed the Marqui&s;&s;e <HI>Spinola,</HI> by &s;peedy me&s;&s;engers and &s;euerall Letters to rai&s;e his &s;iege, and follow the Law of Nature, which teacheth all her Creatures the meanes of pre&s;eruation.</P>
<P>Whereupon, both this Impo&s;ition and the nece&s;|&s;ity of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, with other malignant circum&s;tan|ces, led him out of the wilde fields of peremptori|ne&s;&s;e and pre&s;umption, into the orderly bounds of &s;afety and &s;ecuritie; &s;o that hee lay in waite for an opportunitie to pa&s;&s;e quietly without interception; which (as it &s;hould &s;eeme) he effected in this man|ner: When he perceiued that his Excellency did not ri&s;e, or was not ready, on Sunday our 22 of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> he made a fayre &s;hew of his Army before the out-workes of the Towne, both Hor&s;e and Foot, yet &s;omewhat more remote then hee was accu&s;tomed when hee determined any On-&s;et: whereby, as it ap|peared afterward, his whole campe was blinded from the di&s;couery of the Courts of Guard, and the Town, who prepared to defend them&s;elues, and thought vp|on nothing le&s;&s;e then an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>This done, by twy-light his Cariages were ready, which &s;till kept the left hand of the march; within them went the Ordnance which hee meant to conuey with the Army, and here attended the Pioners, the Camp-followers, and all &s;uch vnnece&s;&s;ary people, as
<PB N="33" REF="18">
belongs to &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. When they were ready, and the &s;coutes brought word the coa&s;t was cleere; for all it &s;eemed a windy and duski&s;h night, he &s;eemed to welcome the opportunity, and &s;et forward the munition with great &s;ilence, and taciturnity, allowing them a &s;ufficient conuoy of hor&s;e, and the pioners conuenient armes for their purpo&s;e: they marched very neere &s;ix houres be|fore hee &s;tird, comming clo&s;e by the wet ground, and drownd land, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Bergen,</HI> where as they &s;ay they met with <HI>Gonzales de Cordua,</HI> and that other part of his Armie, which lay betweene <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Bergen:</HI> Thus they goe on, and before noone the next day came within &s;ixe Engli&s;h mile of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> having &s;pent aboue eighteene houres in the trauell.</P>
<P>By that time the Armie was thus rid of her en|cumbrances, and all this while heard not of an ene|mie, and that the great Generall conceiued they had overgone their affrightings betweene midnight and one a clocke in the morning, the hor&s;eboies and cer|taine men appointed of purpo&s;e, &s;et fire on all their quarters, and burned tho&s;e things which were left, which made &s;o great a &s;moake and &s;mother for the time, that nothing was perceiued till the Army was very forward, and then the fire had ouergone the moi&s;ture, making all things combu&s;tible, &s;o that the flame &s;hewed the glory of her brightne&s;&s;e, and the neighbour places &s;aid apparantly, he was departed: this was the light that ap|peared in <HI>Zealand,</HI> &s;o that the pinckes and pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;ea, without &s;earching further after particulars, only coniectured the &s;iege was rai&s;ed, and &s;o gaue it forth ac|cordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="19">To this, may be added, that of a hundred peeces of ordnance, he caried away but 30, and what is be|come of the re&s;t, time will di&s;couer, tho&s;e which he &s;a|ued, are now brought to <HI>Antwerp</HI>: be&s;ides they &s;ay, that having many wounded and di&s;ea&s;ed people, he proui|ded for all manner of nations, but Scots and Engli&s;h, whom he left to the furie of the fire, and terror of ex|tremitie, but that &s;ome recouered and creeped as it were to the towne, where they found a &s;anctuary contrary to expectation, and the towne heard &s;trange things of them, not to be beleeued in the report. La&s;t of all they relate, he was not fully 18000 hor&s;e and foote: for hauing lo&s;t very neere 10000 by one meanes or other, it was a good account to bring his <HI>Items</HI> to &s;uch a reckoning; and thus much for the ri&s;ing of the Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Spinola</HI> before <HI>Ber|gen.</HI> The next thing (as I &s;uppo&s;e) will be the &s;earches of his Campe place, the demoli&s;hing of his mounts, and fortifications, the refre&s;hing of the towne, the repairing of the decaied places, the watching of the Enemies acti|ons, the mu&s;tering of new forces, the prouiding of muni|tion, and if the winter make much ha&s;te, the Gari&s;oning of &s;ouldiers on all &s;ides; but as yet the eies of iealou&s;ie are in euery corner, and therefore I beleeue they will bee &s;ure of <HI>Spinolaes</HI> &s;etling his Army, before the <HI>States</HI> re|moue theirs.</P>
