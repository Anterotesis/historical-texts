<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_M&V;ch cannot be ex|pected (upon a Subject of this Nature) from a private Per&s;on, and one who was &s;econded with few other helps to accompli&s;h his de&s;ires herein, than to con&s;ult his own thoughts, and a mall number of Books that lay by him. However, the Reader may be well a&s;&s;ured, there is no|thing offered here to his con&s;ide|ration in relation to the Pre&s;ent, or Antient State of <HI>Ireland</HI> (as
<PB REF="3"> far as the Subject would po&s;&s;ibly admit of the &s;ame) but what is back'd with good Authority, and faithfully related by the Author, according to the be&s;t information he could obtain. As for other mat|ters here E&s;&s;ayed by way of con|jecture, the Author well hopes this mean attempt will &s;hortly admini&s;ter a fit occa&s;ion for a more knowing Per&s;on, and abler Pen, to render the World more ample &s;atisfction touching the Publick Affairs, and State of that King|dome; wherein it may &s;eem &s;trange, how that this our Age affords ma|ny Treati&s;es entituled <HI>The pre|&s;ent State of</HI> Enngland, France, Italy, Holland, Venice, Mu&s;covy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet not any thing of that Na|ture (&s;ince his Maje&s;ties happy Restauration) hath been hitherto pre&s;ented to publick view in rela|tion to the State of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though it be one of the chiefe&s;t Members
<PB REF="3"> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire; as if either there were no &s;uch thing in Na|ture; Or at lea&s;t, that the Affairs thereof afforded not any thing wor|thy of Note: whereas indeed the continued infelicity of that un|happy Kingdome (till of late) might alone (be&s;ides many other remarkes made mention of in this en&s;uing Treati&s;e) ju&s;tly breed &s;ome curio&s;ity in any knowing per|&s;on to take into his con&s;ideration, what were the true cau&s;es why that Realm, whereof our Kings of <HI>Eng|land</HI> have born the Title of Sove|reign Lords for the &s;pace of four hundred and odd years (a period of time wherein divers great Monar|chies have ri&s;en from Barbari&s;m to Civility, and fallen again to Ruine) was not in all that &s;pace of time throughly &s;ubdued, &amp; reduced to the obedience of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> although there hath been almo&s;t a continual War between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB REF="4"> and the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> and why the man|ners of the meer <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> were &s;o little altered (till King <HI>James</HI> his Reign) &s;ince the days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second (as appeareth by the de&s;crip|tion made by <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is</HI> who lived and wrote in that time) although there hath been &s;ince that time &s;o many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies plan|ted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as that if the peo|ple had been numbred by the Poll, &s;uch as were de&s;cended of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> race, would have been found more in number, than the antient Na|tives. To give therefore a brief ac|count of the true cau&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;|orders, as al&s;o of the exqui&s;ite re|medies applyed (by the late Settle|ment of <HI>Ireland</HI>) in order to a per|fect Reformation of the &s;ame, is one of the chief ends and de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e, wherein if it gives the Reader any competent &s;atisfaction, the Author will deem him&s;elf there|by well rewarded for his pains.</P>

<P>Many rea&s;ons there are to induce one to be of this opinion; fir&s;t of all according to the fir&s;t command, the <HI>Celtick</HI> Tongue was of force in all the&s;e Northern parts. <HI>Bodinus</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Celtick</HI> Language was all one. <HI>Pau&s;anius</HI> the <HI>Greecian</HI> maketh mention how the <HI>Celts</HI> in their Language called a Hor&s;e <HI>Marc,</HI> and three Hor&s;es, <HI>Trimarc;</HI> the which, the <HI>Welchman</HI> u&s;eth to this day with a guttural alteration, <HI>Margh,</HI> and <HI>Treemargh.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>Cam|den,</HI> the learned Antiquary of this

<P>The City of <HI>Dublin</HI> in times pa&s;t, for the due Admini&s;tration of Civil Government, had a Pro|vo&s;t for the Chief Magi&s;trate: But in the year of Mans Redemption, 1409. King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth granted them liberty to Elect eve|ry year a Mayor and two Bay|liffs, and that the Mayor &s;hould have a guilt Sword carried before him for ever. And <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth (to heap more honour up|on
<PB N="280" REF="158"> this place) changed the two Bayliffs afterwards into Sheriffs: And of late, our Gracious Sove|reign King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, ho|nored this City with a Lord Mayor; So that there is nothing wanting here that may &s;erve to make the State of a City mo&s;t magnificent and flouri&s;hing.</P>
