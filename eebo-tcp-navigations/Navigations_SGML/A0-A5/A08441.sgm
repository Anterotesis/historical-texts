<P>_INflamed as yet with the extreame iniu|ry offered vnto his fo&s;ter-mother, the gratious Queene of <HI>Carthage,</HI> the noble knight of the Sea could not chu&s;e, but continually be deui&s;ing and contriuing for the newe complots, to wreake more &s;ufficient reuengement on the knight of the <HI>Round orbs</HI> (for &s;uch was the deui&s;e in the &s;hielde of the tyrant.) wherefore, &s;o &s;oone as the daies guidre&s;&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oceanders preparation aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;t Mar|cimodes.</NOTE> <HI>Au|rora,</HI> had the next morning appeared, hee armed him&s;elfe in his inchaunted armour; &amp; with the re&s;idue of the <HI>Carthagi|nian</HI> Champions, which bare true loyalty towardes their Soueraigne, hee prepared him&s;elfe to depart towardes the pauilions of <HI>Marcimodes.</HI> But as hee was in egre&s;&s;e from the Ca&s;tle, hee was giuen to vnder&s;tand (by the watchmen from the battlements) of the a&s;&s;ured and pre&s;ent approach of the tyrant to the a&s;&s;aulting of the Ca&s;tle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marcimode<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> marcheth to a&s;&s;ault the Ca&s;tle.</NOTE> with &s;uch a mighty troupe of &s;ouldiers, as they &s;eemed in multitude to pa&s;&s;e the &s;tarres, and in number almo&s;t equall to the &s;andes of the Sea. Wherefore the ba&s;er &s;ort of &s;ouldi|ers, at &s;o vnexpected an infinitie of enemies, &s;toode amazed; and their courage failing them, they wauered betwixt hope and feare, to whether &s;ide they &s;hould betake them&s;elues. Which the valorous knight of the Sea perceiuing; like a good Captaine, in this &s;ort hee cheared vp the hearts of his drouping &s;ouldiers.</P>
