But thence directed our cour&s;e, for a place called by us <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> for that our Captain had &s;o named it in his former voyage, by rea&s;on of the great &s;tore of tho&s;e good|ly Fowls, which he and his Company did then dayly kill, and feed on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iuly</HI> 12.</NOTE> in that place. In this cour&s;e, notwith&s;tanding we had two dayes calme, yet within &s;ix dayes we arived at our <HI>Port Phe&s;ant,</HI> which is a fine round Bay, of very &s;afe harbour for all winds, lying betweene two high points, not pa&s;t halfe a cables length over at the mouth, but within eight or ten cables length every way, having ten or twelve fadome water, more or le&s;&s;e, full of good fi&s;h, the &s;oile al&s;o very fruitfull; which may appear by this, that our Captain having been in this place, within a year and few dayes before, and having rid the place with many alleyes and paths made, yet now all was &s;o overgrowne a|gaine, as that we doubted at fir&s;t, whether this were the &s;ame place or no.</P>
<P>At our entrance into this Bay, our Captaine having gi|ven order to his brother what to do, if any occa&s;ion &s;houd happen in his ab&s;ence, was on his way, with intent to have gone a land, with &s;ome few only in his company, becau&s;e he knew there dwelt no <HI>Spaniards</HI> within thirty five leagues of that place. <HI>Tolou</HI> being the neere&s;t to the Ea&s;t|wards, and <HI>Nomb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e de dios</HI> to the we&s;twards, where any of that Nation dwelt.

<P>When we landed, we found by evident markes, that there had been lately there, a certaine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man of <HI>Plimouth</HI> called <HI>Iohn Garret,</HI> who been conducted thither by certain Engli&s;h Mariners, which had been there with our Captain in &s;ome of his former voyages.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very loving friend IOHN GARRET.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The &s;moake which we &s;aw, was occa&s;ioned by a fire, which the &s;aid <HI>Garret</HI> and his Company had made before their departure, in a very great tree (not farre from this which had the Lead nayled on it) which had continued burning at lea&s;t five dayes before our arrivall.</P>
<P>This adverti&s;ement notwith&s;tanding, our Captain ment not to depart, before he had built his Pinnaces, which were yet aboard in pieces, for which purpo&s;e he knew this Port a mo&s;t convenient place. And therefore &s;o &s;oon as we had mored our &s;hips, our Captain commanded his Pinnaces to be brought a&s;hore, for the Carpenters to &s;et up, him|&s;elf employing al his other company in fortifying a place which he had cho&s;en out as a mo&s;t fit plot of three quar|ters
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of an acre of ground, to make &s;ome &s;trength or &s;afety for the pre&s;ent, as &s;ufficiently as the meanes he had would affoord, which was performed, by felling of great trees &amp; bow&s;ing and haling them together with great Pulleis and halfers, untill they were inclo&s;ed to the waters, and then letting others fall upon them, untill they had rai&s;ed with trees and boughs thirty foot in height round about, lea|ving only one gate to i&s;&s;ue at neet the waters &s;ide, which every night (that we might &s;leepe in more &s;afety and &s;e|curity) was &s;hut up, with a great tree drawn a'rthwart it. The whole plot was built in a Pentagonall form, <HI>to wit,</HI> of five equall &s;ides and angles, of which angles two were to|wards the &s;ea, and that &s;ide between them was left open, for the ea&s;ie launcing of our Pinna&s;es: the other four e|qual &s;ides were cholely (excepting the gate before men|tioned) firmly clo&s;ed up. Without, in&s;tead of a trench, the ground was rid for fifty foot &s;pace, round about. The re&s;t was very thick with trees, of which many were of tho&s;e kindes, which are never without green leaves, till they are dead at the root (exeepting onely one kind of tree among&s;t them, much like to our A&s;h, which when the Sun commeth right over them, cau&s;ing great raines, &s;uddenly ca&s;teth all their leaves, <HI>viz.</HI> within three dayes, and yet within &s;ix dayes after becomes all green againe; the leaves of the other trees do al&s;o in part fal away, but &s;o as the trees continue &s;till green notwith&s;tanding) being of a marvelous height, and &s;upported as it were with five or &s;ix naturall buttre&s;&s;es growing out of their bodies, &s;o far, that three men may &s;o be hidden in each of them that they which &s;hall &s;tand in the very next buttre&s;&s;e &s;hall not be able to &s;ee them. One of them &s;pecially was marked to have had &s;even of tho&s;e &s;tayes or buttre&s;&s;es for the &s;up|porting of his greatnes &amp; height, which being mea&s;ured with a line clo&s;e by the barke and neer to the ground, as it

<P>The <HI>Negroes</HI> which were in tho&s;e Fregates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iuly</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</NOTE> gave us &s;om particular under&s;tanding of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Town: and be&s;ides, told us that they had heard a report, that cer|tain Souldiers &s;hould come thither &s;hortly, &amp; were daily looked for from the Governor of <HI>Panama</HI> and the Coun|trey thereabout, to defend the Town again&s;t the <HI>Symerons</HI> (a black People, which about eighty years pa&s;t, fled from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> their Ma&s;ters, by rea&s;on of their cruelty, and are &s;ince growne to an Nation under two Kings of their own; the one inhabiteth to the We&s;t, th' other to the Ea&s;t of the way from <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to <HI>Panama</HI>) who had neer &s;urpri&s;ed it about &s;ix weeks before.</P>

<P>Then we weighed againe and &s;et &s;ayle, rowing hard a|board the &s;hoare, with as much &s;ilence as we could, till we recovered the point of the harbour under the high land: there we &s;tayed all &s;ilent, purpo&s;ing to attempt the towne in the dawning of the day, after that we had repo&s;ed our &s;elves for a while.</P>
<P>But our Captain with &s;ome others of his be&s;t men, fin|ding that our people were talking of the greatne&s;&s;e of the towne and what their &s;trength might be, e&s;pecially by the report of the Negroes that we tooke in the I&s;le of <HI>Pi|nos</HI>: thought it be&s;t to put the&s;e conceits out of their heads, and therefore to take the opportunity of the ri&s;ing of the Moone that night, per&s;wading them that it was the day dawning. By this occa&s;ion we were at the Towne a large hour &s;ooner then fir&s;t was purpo&s;ed.

<P>There we found &s;ix great Pieces of bra&s;&s;e Ordnance, mounted upon their Carriages, &s;ome Demy, &s;ome whole Culvering: we pre&s;ently di&s;mounted them, the Gunner fled, the Towne tooke alarme (being very ready thereto, by rea&s;on of their often di&s;quieting, by their neer neigh|bours the <HI>Symerons</HI>) as we perceived, not only by the noy&s;e and cryes of the people, but by the Bell ringing out, and Drums running up and down the Towne.</P>
<P>Our Captaine, according to the directions which he had given over night, to &s;uch as he had made choyce of for the purpo&s;e, left twelve to keep the Pinnaces, that we might be &s;ure of a &s;afe retreit, if the wor&s;t befell. And having made &s;ure worke of the Platforme before he would enter the Town, he thought be&s;t, fir&s;t to view the Mount, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Towne, where he was in|formed, by &s;undry intelligences the yeare before, they had an intent to plant Ordnance, which might &s;cower round about the Towne. Therefore leaving one halfe of his company, to make a &s;tand at the foot of the mount, he marched up pre&s;ently unto the top of it, with all &s;peed, to try the truth of the report for the more &s;afety. There we found no peece of Ordnance, but onely a very fit place prepared for &s;uch u&s;e, and therefore we left it with|out any of our men, and with all celerity returned downe the Mount. Then our Captaine appointed his Brother, with <HI>John Oxnam</HI> and &s;ixteene other of his men to goe about behind the Kings trea&s;ure-hou&s;e, and enter neere the Ea&s;ter end of the market-place: him&s;elfe with the re&s;t, would pa&s;&s;e up the broad &s;treet, into the market-place, with &s;ound of Drum and Trumpet.</P>

<P>Yet by meanes of the Souldiers which were in the Towne, and by rea&s;on of the time which we &s;pent in marching up and downe the Mount, the Souldiers and the Inhabitants had put them&s;elves in Armes, and brought their Companies in &s;ome order, at the South-ea&s;t end of the Market-place, neere the Governours Hou&s;e, and not farre from the Gate of the Towne, which is onely one, lea|ding towards <HI>Panama,</HI> having (as it &s;eemes) gathered them|&s;elves thither, either that in the Governours &s;ight they might &s;hew their Valour, if it might prevaile, or el&s;e that by the Gate they might be&s;t take their <HI>Vale,</HI> and e&s;cape readie&s;t.</P>
<P>And to make a &s;hew of farre greater numbers of &s;hot, or el&s;e of a cu&s;tome they had, by the like device to terri|fie the <HI>Symerons,</HI> they had hung Lines with Matches light|ed, overthwart the We&s;ter-end of the Market-place, be|tweene the Church and the Cro&s;&s;e, as though there had beene in a readine&s;&s;e &s;ome company of &s;hot, whereas in|deed there was not pa&s;t two or three that taught the&s;e Lines to dance, till they them&s;elves ran away, as &s;oone as they perceived they were di&s;covered.</P>
<P>But the Souldiers, and &s;uch as were joyned with them, pre&s;ented us with a jolly hot volley of &s;hot, beating full upon the egre&s;&s;e of that Street in which we marched, and levelling very low, &s;o as their Bullets oft-times grazed on the Sand.

<P>In following and returning, diver&s;e of our men were hurt, with the weapons which the Enemy had let fall as he fled: &s;omewhat, for that we marched with &s;uch &s;peed, but more for that they lay &s;o thicke and cro&s;&s;e one on the other.</P>
<P>Being returned, we made our &s;tand neer the mid&s;t of the market place, where a tree groweth hard by the cro&s;&s;e; whence our Captaine &s;ent &s;ome of our men to &s;tay the ringing of the alarme Bell, which had continued all this while: but the Church being very &s;trongly built and fa&s;t &s;hut, they could not without firing (which our Captaine forbad) get into the &s;teeple where the Bell hung.</P>

<P>At our comming to the Governours hou&s;e, we found the great doore (where the Moyles do u&s;ually unlade) even then opened; a Candle lighted upon the top of the &s;tayers; and a faire Gennet ready &s;adled, either for the Governour him&s;elfe or &s;ome other of his hou&s;e-hold to carry it after him. By meanes of this light, we &s;aw a huge heape of Silver, in that nether roome: being a pile of bars of &s;ilver, of as (neere as we could gue&s;&s;e) &s;eventy foot in length, of ten foot in breadth, and twelve foot in height, piled up again&s;t the wall, each barre was between thirty five and forty pound in weight. At &s;ight hereof our Cap|taine commanded &s;traightly that none of us &s;hould touch a barre of &s;ilver, but &s;tand upon our weapons, becau&s;e the Towne was full of people, and there was in the Kings trea&s;ure hou&s;e neere the waters &s;ide, more gold and jewels then all our four Pinnaces would carry, which we would pre&s;ently &s;et &s;ome in hand to break open, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> reports of the &s;trength of it.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner returned to our &s;trength, but there was a report brought by &s;ome of our men, that our Pin|naces were in danger to be taken, and that if we our &s;elves got not aboard before day, we &s;hould be oppre&s;t with multitudes both of Souldiers and townes people. This re|port had his ground from one <HI>Diego</HI> a <HI>Negro,</HI> who in the time of the fir&s;t conflict, came and called to our Pinnaces, to know whether they were Captaine <HI>Drakes</HI>? and upon an&s;wer received, continued intreating to be taken aboard

(though he had fir&s;t three or foure &s;hot made at him) un|till at length they fetch him, and learned by him, that not pa&s;t eight dayes before our arrivall the King had &s;ent thither &s;ome hundred and fifty Souldiers to guard the Towne again&s;t the <HI>Symerons,</HI> and the Towne at this time was full of people be&s;ides: which, all the rather beleeved, becau&s;e it agreed with the report of the Negroes, which we tooke before at the I&s;le of <HI>Pinos</HI>: and therefore our Captaine &s;ent his brother and <HI>John Oxnam</HI> to under&s;tand the truth thereof. They found our men, which we left in our Pinnaces, much frighted, by rea&s;on that they &s;aw great Troopes and Companies running up and downe, with matches light, &s;ome with other weapons; crying <HI>Que gente? que gente?</HI> which having not been at the fir&s;t conflict but comming from the utter ends of the Towne (being at lea&s;t as bigge as <HI>Plimouth</HI>) came many times neere us, and under&s;tanding that we were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> di&s;|charged their Peeces and ran away.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after this, a mighty &s;hower of raine, with a terrible &s;torme of thunder and lightning, fell, which pow|red downe &s;o vehemently (as it u&s;ually doth in tho&s;e Countries) that before we could recover the &s;helter of a certaine &s;hade or pent-hou&s;e, at the We&s;ter end of the Kings trea&s;ure-hou&s;e (which &s;eemeth to have been built there of purpo&s;e to avoid Sunne and Raine) &s;ome of our bow-&s;trings were wet, and &s;ome of our match and pow|der hurt: which while we were carefull of to refurni&s;h and &s;upply; diver&s;e of our men, harping on the reports lately brought us, were muttering of the Forces of the Towne, which our Captaine perceiving, told them, that he had brought them to the mouth of the trea&s;ure of the World, if they would want it, they might henceforth blame no body but them&s;elves. And therefore as &s;oone as the &s;torme began to a&s;&s;wage of his fury (which was
<PB N="15" REF="11">
a long halfe houre) willing to give his Men no longer lea&s;ure to demurre of tho&s;e doubts, nor yet allow the E|nemy farther re&s;pite to gather them&s;elves together; he &s;tept forward, commanding his Brother, with <HI>John Ox|nam</HI> and the Company appointed them, to breake the Kings Trea&s;ure-hou&s;e; the re&s;t to follow him, to keep the &s;trength of the market place, till they had di&s;patched the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e for which they came.</P>
<P>But as he &s;tept forward, his &s;trength and &s;ight and &s;peech failed him, and he began to faint for want of blood, which as then we perceived, had, in great quan|tity, i&s;&s;ued upon the Sand, out of a wound received in his legge in the fir&s;t incounter, whereby though he felt &s;ome paine, yet (for that he perceived diver&s;e of the Com|pany, having already gotten many good things, to be very ready to take all occa&s;ions, of winding them&s;elves, out of that conceited danger) would he not have it knowne to any, till this his fainting, again&s;t his will, bewrayed it, the blood having fir&s;t filled the very prints which our foot-&s;teps made, to the great di&s;may of all our Com|pany, who thought it not credible, that one man &s;hould be able to &s;pare &s;o much blood and live.</P>
<P>And therefore even they, which were willinge&s;t to have adventured mo&s;t, for &s;o faire a booty, would in no ca&s;e hazzard their Captaines life; but (having given him &s;omewhat to drinke wherewith he recovered him&s;elfe, and having bound his Scarfe about his legge, for the &s;topping of the blood) entreated him to be content to goe with them aboard, there to have his wound &s;earched and dre&s;t, and then to returne a &s;hoare againe if he thought good.</P>

&s;tate in which they now were; and was of opinion, that it were more honourable for him&s;elfe, to jeopard his life for &s;o great a benefit, then to leave off &s;o high an enter|prize unperformed:) they joyned altogether, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce mingled with faire intreaty, they bare him aboard his Pinnace, and &s;o abandoned a mo&s;t rich &s;poyle for the pre&s;ent, onely to pre&s;erve their Captaines life, as being re&s;olved of him, that while they enjoyed his pre&s;ence, and had him to command them, they might recover wealth &s;ufficient; but if once they lo&s;t him, they &s;hould hardly be able to recover home, no not with that which they had gotten already.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 29</NOTE>Thus we embarqued by breake of the day, having be|&s;ides our Captaine, many of our Men wounded, though none &s;laine but one Trumpeter: whereupon though our Chyrurgeons were bu&s;ily employed, in providing reme|dies and Salves for their wounds; yet the maine care of our Captaine was re&s;pected by all the re&s;t: &s;o that before we departed out of the Harbour for the more comfort of our Company, we tooke the afore&s;aid Ship of Wines without great re&s;i&s;tance. But before we had her free off the Haven, they of the Towne had made meanes to bring one of their Culverins, which we had di&s;mounted, &s;o as they made a &s;hot at us, but hindered not us from carrying forth the Prize to the I&s;le <HI>Bastimientes,</HI> or <HI>The I&s;le of Vi|ctuales</HI>; which is an Iland that lyeth without the Bay to the We&s;twards, about a league off the Towne, where we &s;tayed the two next dayes, to cure our wounded Men, and to refre&s;h our &s;elves in the goodly Gardens which we there found, abounding with great &s;tore of all dainty Roots and Fruits, be&s;ides great plenty of Poultery and other Fowles, no le&s;&s;e &s;trange then delicate.</P>
<P>Shortly upon our fir&s;t arrivall in this Iland, the Gover|nour and the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the Towne (as we

afterwards under&s;tood) &s;ent unto our Captaine a pro|per Gentleman of meane &s;tature, good complexion, and faire &s;poken, a principall Souldier of the late &s;ent Garri&s;on, to view in what &s;tate we were. At his com|ming he prote&s;ted he came to us of meere good will, for that we had attempted, &s;o great and incredible a matter with &s;o few men: and that at the fir&s;t they feared that we had beene <HI>French,</HI> at who&s;e hands they knew they &s;hould finde no mercy: but after they perceived by our Arrowes, that we were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, their feares were the le&s;&s;e, for that they knew, that though we tooke the Trea&s;ure of the place, yet we would not u&s;e cruelty to|wards their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But albeit this his affection gave him cau&s;e enough, to come aboard &s;uch who&s;e vertues he &s;o honoured, yet the Governour al&s;o had not only con&s;ented to his comming, but directly &s;ent him, upon occa&s;ion that diver&s;e of the Towne affirmed (&s;aid he) that they knew our Captaine, who the la&s;t two yeares had beene often on their Coa&s;t, and had alwayes u&s;ed their per&s;ons very well. And there|fore de&s;ired to know, fir&s;t, whether our Captaine were the &s;ame Captaine <HI>Drake</HI> or no? and next, becau&s;e ma|ny of their men were wounded with our Arrowes, whe|ther they were poy&s;oned or no? And how their wounds might be&s;t be cured? La&s;tly, what victuals we wanted or other nece&s;&s;aries? Of which the Governour promi&s;ed by him to &s;upply and furni&s;h us, as largely as he dur&s;t. Our Captaine although he thought this Souldier but a Spy: yet u&s;ed him very courteou&s;ly, and an&s;wered him to his Governours demands. That he was the &s;ame <HI>Drake</HI> whom they meant: it was never his manner to poy&s;on his Arrowes: they might cure their wounded by ordinary Chyrurgery: as for wants he knew the Iland of <HI>Ba&s;timi|entos</HI> had &s;ufficient, and could furni&s;h him if he li&s;ted: but
<PB N="18" REF="13">
he wanted nothing but &s;ome of that &s;peciall commodity, which that Countrey yeelded, to content him&s;elfe and his Company. And therefore he advi&s;ed the Governour to hold open his eyes, for before he departed, if God lent him life and leave, he meant to reape &s;ome of their Harve&s;t, which they get out of the Earth, and &s;end into <HI>Spaine</HI> to trouble all the Earth.</P>
<P>To this an&s;wer unlooked for, this Gentleman replyed: If he might without offence move &s;uch a que&s;tion, what &s;hould then be the cau&s;e of our departing from that Towne at this time, where was above three hundred and &s;ixty Tun of &s;ilver ready for the Fleet, and much more Gold in value, re&s;ting in Iron Che&s;ts in the Kings Trea|&s;ure-hou&s;e? But when our Captaine had &s;hewed him the true cau&s;e of his unwilling retreat aboard; he acknow|ledged, that we had no le&s;&s;e rea&s;on in departing, then courage in attempting: and no doubt did ea&s;ily &s;ee, that it was not for the Towne to &s;eeke revenge of us, by man|ning forth &s;uch Frigates or other ve&s;&s;els, as they had: but better to content them&s;elves and provide for their owne defence.</P>
<P>Thus with great favour and courteous entertainment, be&s;ides &s;uch gifts from our Captaine as mo&s;t contented him: after dinner he was in &s;uch &s;ort di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to make report of that he had &s;een, that he prote&s;ted, he was ne|ver &s;o much honoured of any in his life.</P>
<P>After his departure, the Negroe fore-mentioned, be|ing examined more fully, confirmed this report of the Gold and Silver, with many other intelligences of im|portance, e&s;pecially how we might have Gold and Silver enough if we would, by meanes of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> whom though he had betrayed diver&s;e times (being u&s;ed thereto by his Ma&s;ters) &s;o that he knew they would kill him, if they gat him: yet if our Captaine would undertake his

<P>After that our Captaine had brought all his Fleet to|gether: at the <HI>Scrivanos</HI> entreaties, he vvas content to doe them all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in &s;etting them and all their Companies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thence vvith the Ilands of Saint <HI>Ber|nards,</HI> about three leagues off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own; vvhere vve found great &s;tore of Fi&s;h for our refre&s;hing.</P>
<P>Here our Captaine con&s;idering that he vvas now di&s;co|vered, upon two of the chiefe&s;t places of all the Coa&s;t, and yet not meaning to leave it, till he had found the <HI>Simerons,</HI> and made his Voyage, as he had conceived, which would require &s;ome length of time, and &s;ure man|ning of his Pinnaces, he determined with him&s;elfe, to bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne one of his Ships, and make of the other a Store-hou&s;e, that his Pinnaces (which could not otherwi&s;e) might be throughly Manned, and &s;o he might be able to abide any time.

But when our Captaine had imparted to him his cau&s;es, and had per|&s;waded him with promi&s;e that it &s;hould not be knowne, till all of them &s;hould be glad of it: he undertooke it, and did it accordingly.</P>
<P>The next morning our Captaine tooke his Pinnace very early,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 15.</NOTE> purpo&s;ing to goe a fi&s;hing (for that there is very great &s;tore in all the Coa&s;t) and falling a board the <HI>Swanne,</HI> calleth for his Brother to goe with him, who ri|&s;ing &s;uddenly, an&s;wereth that he would follow pre&s;ently, or if it would plea&s;e him to &s;tay a very little, he would at|tend him. Our Captaine perceiving the feat wrought, would not ha&s;ten him, but in rowing away, demanded of them, why their Barke was &s;o deepe? as making no ac|count of it: but by occa&s;ion of this demand, his Brother &s;ent one downe to the Steward to know whether there were any water in the &s;hip? or what other cau&s;e might be? The Steward ha&s;tily &s;tepping downe at his u&s;uall skuttle, was wet up to the wa&s;te, and &s;hifting with more ha&s;te to come up againe as if the water had followed him, cryed out that the Ship was full of wa|ter. There was no need to ha&s;ten the Company, &s;ome to Pumpe, others to &s;earch for the Leake, which the Captaine of the Barke &s;eeing they did on all hands very willingly, he followed his Brother, and certified him of the &s;trange chance befaln them that night; that where|as they had not Pumpt twice in &s;ix weekes before, now they had &s;ix foote water in hold&punc; therefore he de&s;i|reth leave from attending him in fi&s;hing, to intend

the &s;earch and remedy of the leake: and when our Cap|taine with his Company profered to go to helpe them, he an&s;wered, they had men enough aboard, and prayed him to continue his fi&s;hing, that they might have &s;ome part of it for their dinner. Thus returning, he found his Com|pany had taken great paines, but had freed the water ve|ry little: yet &s;uch was their love to the Barke (as our Captaine well knew) that they cea&s;ed not, but to the ut|mo&s;t of their &s;trength, laboured all that they might till three in the afternoone, by which time, the Company perceiving, that though they had beene relieved by our Captaine him&s;elfe and many of his Company, yet they were not able to free above a foot and a halfe of water, and could have no likelihood of finding the Leake, had now a le&s;&s;e liking of her then before, and greater content to hear of &s;ome means for remedy: whereupon our Cap|tain con&s;ulting with them what they thought be&s;t to be done: found that they had more de&s;ire to have all as he thought fit, then judgement to conceive any meanes of remedy. And therefore he propounded, that him&s;elfe would goe into the Pinnace, till he could provide &s;ome hand&s;ome Frigate, and that his Brother &s;hould be Captaine in the Admirall, and the Ma&s;ter &s;hould al&s;o be there placed with him, in&s;tead of this: which &s;eeing they could not &s;ave, he would have fired, that the Enemy might never recover her: but fir&s;t all the Pinnaces &s;hould be brought aboard her, that every one might take out of her what&s;oever they lackt or liked. This, though the company at the fir&s;t marveiled at, yet pre&s;ently it was put in execution and performed that night: our Captaine had his de&s;ire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 16.</NOTE> and men enough for his Pinnaces.</P>
<P>The next morning, we re&s;olved to &s;eek out &s;ome fit place, in the &s;ound of <HI>Dorrienne,</HI> where we might &s;afely leave our &s;hip at Anchor, not di&s;coverable by the Enemy,

who thereby might imagine us quite departed from the Coa&s;t, and we the meane time better follow our purpo&s;es with our Pinnaces; of which our Captaine would him|&s;elfe take two to <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> and the third leave with his Brother to &s;eeke the <HI>Symerons.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this re&s;olution,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 21.</NOTE> we &s;et &s;aile pre&s;ently for the &s;aid Sound, which within five dayes we recovered, ab&s;teining of purpo&s;e, from all &s;uch occa&s;ion as might hinder our determination, or bewray our being upon the Coa&s;t. As &s;oone as we arrived, where our Captaine intended, and had cho&s;en a fit and convenient road (out of all trade) for our purpo&s;e; we repo&s;ed our &s;elves there for &s;ome fif|teene dayes, keeping our &s;elves clo&s;e, that the bruit of our being upon the Coa&s;t might cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the meane time we were not idle: for be&s;ides &s;uch ordinary workes, as our Captaine every Moneth did u&s;ually inure us to, about the trimming and fitting of his Pinnaces, for their better &s;ailing and rowing: he cau&s;ed us to rid a large plot of ground, both of Trees and Brakes, and to build us Hou&s;es, &s;ufficient for all our lodging, and one e&s;pecially for all our publique mee|tings, wherein the <HI>Negro</HI> which fled to us before did us great &s;ervice, as being well acquainted with the Coun|trey, and their meanes of Building. Our Archers made them&s;elves Butts to &s;hoot at, becau&s;e we had many that delighted in that Exerci&s;e, and wanted not a Fletcher to keepe our Bowes and Arrowes in order. The re&s;t of the Company, every one as he liked be&s;t, made his di&s;|port at Bowles, Quoits, Keiles, &amp;c. For our Captaine allowed one halfe of their Company to pa&s;&s;e their time thus, every other day interchangeably, the other halfe being enjoyned to the nece&s;&s;ary workes, about our Ship and Pinnaces, and the providing of fre&s;h Victuals, Fi&s;h, Fowle, Hogs, Deere, Conies, &amp;c. whereof there is great

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 22.</NOTE>We were forced to &s;pend the be&s;t part of three dayes, after our departure from our <HI>Port Plentie,</HI> before we were quiet in the new-found Road, which we had but newly entred, when our two Men and the former Troope of <HI>Simerons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 23.</NOTE> with twelve other whom they had met in the Mountaines, came in &s;ight over again&s;t our Ship, on the Maine: whence we fet them all aboard, to their great comfort and our content: they rejoycing that they &s;hould have &s;ome fit opportunity, to wreake their wrongs on the <HI>Spaniards</HI>: we hoping that now our Voyage &s;hould be bettered.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t meeting, when our Captaine had moved them, to &s;hew him the meanes which they had to furni&s;h him with Gold and Silver; they an&s;wered plainly, that had they knowne Gold had been his de&s;ire, they could have &s;atisfied him with &s;tore, which for the pre&s;ent they could not doe, becau&s;e the Rivers, in which they had &s;uncke great &s;tore, which they had taken from the

<P>This an&s;wer, although it were &s;omewhat unlooked for, yet nothing di&s;contented us, but rather per&s;waded us far|ther of their hone&s;t and faithfull meaning towards us. Therefore our Captaine to entertaine the&s;e five Moneths, commanded all our Ordnance and Artillery a &s;hoare, with all our other Provi&s;ions; &s;ending his Pinnaces to the Maine, to bring over great Trees, to make a Fort upon the &s;ame Iland, for the planting of all our Ordnance therein, and for our &s;afeguard, if the Enemy in all this time &s;hould chance to come.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Symerons</HI> cut downe <HI>Palmito</HI> boughes and bran|ches,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 24.</NOTE> and with wonderfull &s;peed rai&s;ed up two large Hou|&s;es for all our Company.

and was pre&s;ently returned, with another me&s;&s;age: that, the King had forbidden to traffique with any forraigne Nation for any Commodities, except Powder and Shot, of which if we had any &s;tore, they would be his Mer|chants; he an&s;wered, that he was come from his Country, to exchange his Commodities for Gold and Silver, and is not purpo&s;ed to returne without his errand. They are like (in his opinion) to have little re&s;t, if that by faire meanes they would not traffique with him. He gave this Me&s;&s;enger a faire Shirt for a reward, and &s;o returned him: who rowled his Shirt about his head and &s;wamme very &s;peedily.</P>
<P>We heard no an&s;wer all that day, and therefore to|ward night we went aboord our Frigates and repo&s;ed our &s;elves, &s;etting and keeping very orderly all that night our watch, with great and &s;mall &s;hot.</P>
<P>The next morning the winde which had beene We&s;t|erly in the evening, altered to the Ea&s;tward. About the dawning of the day, wee e&s;pied two Sayles turning to|wards us; whereupon our Captaine weighed with his Pinnaces, leaving the two Frigates unmand. But when we were come &s;ome what nigh them, the winde calmed, and we were faine to row towards them, till that approch|ing very nigh we &s;aw many heads peering over boord.

For he found that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hifting thence, &s;ome of them were faine to &s;wim a land (the Canow not being able to receive them) and had left their apparrell, &s;ome their Rapiers and Targets, &s;ome their Flaskes and Callivers behind them, although they were towing away of one of them: therefore con|&s;idering that we could not man them, we &s;uncke the one, burnt the other, giving them to under&s;tand by this, that we perceived their &s;ecret practi&s;es.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Octo.</HI> 22.</NOTE>This being done, he returned to <HI>John Oxnam,</HI> who all this while lay by the men of warre without proffering of fight. And as &s;oone as our Captaine was come up to the&s;e Frigates, the wind blew much from the Sea, &s;o that we being betwixt the &s;hoare and them, were in a manner forced to beare roome into the Harbour before them, to the great joy of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who beheld it, in &s;uppo|&s;ing, that we would &s;till have fled before them. But a&s;|&s;oone as we were in the Harbour, and felt &s;mooth water, our Pinnaces (as we were a&s;&s;ured of) getting the winde, we fought with them upon the advantage, &s;o that after a few &s;hot exchanged, and a &s;torme ri&s;ing, they were con|tented to pre&s;&s;e no neerer. Therefore as they let fall their Anchors, we pre&s;ently let drop our Grapners in the winde of them, which the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Souldiers &s;eeing, con|&s;idering the di&s;advantage of the winde, the likelyhood of the &s;torme to continue, and &s;mall hope of doing any good, they were glad to retire them&s;elves to the Towne. But by rea&s;on of the foule and tempe&s;tuous weather, we rode there foure dayes, feeling great cold, by rea&s;on we had &s;uch &s;ore raines with We&s;terly winde, and &s;o little &s;uccour in our Pinnaces.</P>

Therefore we concluded to goe to Sea a|gaine, putting forth through <HI>Boca chica,</HI> with intent to take downe our Ma&s;ts, upon hope of faire weather, and to ride under the Rockes called <HI>Las Serenas,</HI> which are two leagves off at Sea, as we had u&s;ually done aforetime, &s;o that they could not di&s;cerne us from the Rocks. But there the Sea was &s;o mightily growne, that we were forced to take the Harbour againe: where we remained &s;ix dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nove.</HI> 2.</NOTE> not|with&s;tanding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> grieved greatly at our aboad there &s;o long, put an other device in practi&s;e to in|danger us.</P>
<P>For they &s;ent forth a great Shallop, a fine Gundeloe, and a great Canow, with certaine <HI>Spaniards</HI> with &s;hot, and many <HI>Indians</HI> with poy&s;oned Arrowes, as it &s;ee|med, with intent to begin &s;ome fight, and then to flye.

<P>They kept them&s;elves upon their Oares at Calliver &s;hot di&s;tance, &s;pending Powder apace, as we did &s;ome two or three houres. We had one of our Men onely wounded in that Fight; what they had is unknowne to us, but we &s;aw their Pinnaces &s;hot thorow in divers places, and the Pow|der of one of them tooke on fire; whereupon we waighed, intending to beare roome, to over-runne them; which they perceiving, and thinking that we would have boor|ded them, rowed away amaine to the defence vvhich they had in the Wood; the rather, becau&s;e they vvere di&s;ap|pointed of their helpe, that they expected from the Fri|gate vvhich vvas vvarping towards us, but by rea&s;on of the much Winde that blew, could not come to offend us, or &s;uccour them.</P>

<P>We endured with our allowance &s;even or eight dayes more, proceeding to the Ea&s;twards, and bearing roome for <HI>Santa Martha,</HI> upon hope to finde &s;ome Shipping in the Read, or Limpets on the Rockes, or &s;uccour a|gain&s;t the Storme in that good Harbour.

<P>This la&s;t day our Captain did behold and view, the mo&s;t of all that faire City, di&s;cerning the large Street which lyeth directly from the Sea into the Land, South and North. By three of the clocke we came into this Grove, pa&s;&s;ing (for the more &s;ecrecy) along&s;t a certaine River, which at that time was almo&s;t dryed up.</P>
<P>Having di&s;po&s;ed of our &s;elves in the Grove, we di&s;|patched our Spye an houre before night, &s;o that by the clo&s;ing in of the evening, he might be in the City; as he was: whence pre&s;ently he returned unto us, that which very happily he under&s;tood by Companions of his; That the Tea&s;urer of <HI>Lima,</HI> intending to pa&s;&s;e into <HI>Spaine</HI> in the fir&s;t <HI>advi&s;o</HI> (which was a Ship of three hundred and fifty Tunne, a very good Sayler) was ready that night, to take his journey towards <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> with his Daughter and Family; having fourteene Moyles in company, of which, eight was laden with Gold, &amp; one with Jewels. And farther, that there were two other <HI>Recoes,</HI> of fifty Moyles in each, laden with Victuals for the mo&s;t part, with &s;ome little quantity of Silver, to come forth that night after the

<P>Upon this notice, we forthwith Marched foure leagues, till we came within two leagues of <HI>Venta Cruz</HI>; in which March, two of our <HI>Symerons</HI> which were &s;ent before, by &s;cent of his Match, found and brought a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> whom they had found a &s;leepe by the way, by &s;cent of the &s;aid Match, and drawing neere thereby, heard him taking his breath as he &s;lept; and being but one, they fell upon him, &s;topt his mouth from crying, put out his Match, and bound him &s;o, that they well neare &s;trangled him by that time he was brought unto us. By examining him, we found all that to be true, which our Spye had reported to us, and that he was a Souldier entertained with others by the Trea&s;urer, for the guard and conduct of this Trea&s;ure, from <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios.</HI></P>
<P>This Souldier having learned who our Captaine was, tooke courage, and was bold to make two reque&s;ts unto him; the one, that he would command his <HI>Symerons,</HI> which hated the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (e&s;pecially the Souldiers) extreamly, to &s;pare his life, which he doubted not but they would doe at his charge: the other was, that &s;eeing he was a Soul|dier, and a&s;&s;ured him, that they &s;hould have that night, more Gold, be&s;ides Jewels and Pearles of great price, then all they could carry (if not, then he was to be dealt with how they would) but if they all found it &s;o, then it might plea&s;e our Captaine to give unto him, as much as it might &s;uffize for him and his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e to live upon, as he had heard our Captaine had done to divers others: for which he would make his name &s;o famous, as any of them, which had received like favour.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="33">Being at the place appointed, our Captaine with halfe of his men, lay on one &s;ide of the way, about fifty paces off in the long gra&s;&s;e; <HI>Iohn Oxnam</HI> with the Captaine of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> and the other halfe, lay on the other &s;ide of the way, at the like di&s;tance: but &s;o farre behind, that as occa&s;ion &s;erved, the former Company might take the foremo&s;t Moyles by the heads, and the other the hindmo&s;t, becau&s;e the Moyles tyed together, are alwayes driven one after another; and e&s;pecially that if we &s;hould have need to u&s;e our weapons that night, we might be &s;ure not to endamage our fellows. We had not laine thus in ambu&s;h much above an houre, but we heard the <HI>Recoes</HI> comming from the City to <HI>&V;enta Cruz,</HI> and from <HI>&V;enta Cruz</HI> to the City, vvhich hath a very common and great trade, vvhen the Fleetes are there: vve heard them, by rea&s;on they delight much to have deepe &s;ounding Bels, which in a &s;till night are heard ve|ry far off.</P>
<P>Now though there vvere as great charge given as might be, that none of our men &s;hould &s;how or &s;tirre them&s;elves&punc; but let all that came from <HI>&V;enta Cruz</HI> to pa&s;&s;e quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly: yea their <HI>Recoes</HI> al&s;o, becau&s;e vve knew that they brought nothing but Merchandi&s;e from thence: yet one of our men called <HI>Robert Pike,</HI> having drunken too much <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> vvithout vvater, forgat him&s;elfe, and enti&s;ing a <HI>Symeron</HI> forth vvith him, vvas gone hard to the way, vvith intent to have &s;hewne his forwardne&s;&s;e on the foremo&s;t Moyles. And when a Cavalier from <HI>&V;enta Cruz</HI> vvell mounted, with his Page running at his &s;tir|rop, pa&s;t by unadvi&s;edly he ro&s;e up to &s;ee vvhat he vvas; but the <HI>Semeron</HI> of better di&s;cretion puld him dovvne, and lay upon him, that he might not di&s;cover them any more&punc; Yet by this the Gentleman had taken notice by
<PB N="59" REF="33">
&s;eeing one all in white: for that we had all put our &s;hirts over o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r other apparrell, that we might be &s;ure to know our owne men in the pell mell in the night. By meanes of this &s;ight, the Cavalier putting &s;purs to his hor&s;e, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de a fal&s;e Gallop, as de&s;irous not only him&s;elfe to be free of this doubt; which he imagined, but al&s;o to give ad|verti&s;ement to others that they might avoid it.</P>
<P>Our Captaine who had heard and ob&s;erved (by rea|&s;on of the hardne&s;&s;e of the ground and &s;tilne&s;&s;e of the nigh) the change of this Gentlemans trot to a gal|lop, &s;u&s;pected that he was di&s;covered, but could not imagine by who&s;e fault, neither did the time give him lea&s;ure to &s;earch. And therefore con&s;idering that it might be, by rea&s;on or the danger of the place, well knowne to ordinary Travellers: we lay &s;till in expecta|tion of the Trea&s;urers comming, who was by this time within halfe a league, and had come forwards to us, but that this Hor&s;eman meeting him, and (as we afterwards learned by the other <HI>Recoes</HI>) making report to him, what he had &s;eene pre&s;ently that night, what he heard of Captaine <HI>Drake</HI> this long time, and what he conjectured to be mo&s;t likely: <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;aid Captaine <HI>Drake,</HI> or &s;ome for him, di&s;appointed of his expectation, of getting any great Trea&s;ure, both at <HI>Nombre de dios</HI> and other places, was by &s;ome meanes or other come by land, in covert thorow the Woods un|to this place to &s;peed for his purpo&s;e: and thereupon per&s;waded him to turne his <HI>Reco</HI> out of the way, and let the other <HI>Recoes,</HI> which were comming after to pa&s;&s;e on. They vvere whole <HI>Recoes,</HI> and loaden but with Victuals for the mo&s;t part, &s;o that the lo&s;&s;e of them were farre le&s;&s;e if the wor&s;t befell, and yet they &s;hould &s;erve to di&s;|cover them as well as the be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="34">Thus by the rechle&s;ne&s;&s;e of one of our Company, and by the carefulne&s;&s;e of this Traveller, we were di&s;ap|pointed of a mo&s;t rich booty, which is to be thought God would not &s;hould be taken, for that by all likelihood it was well gotten by that Trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>The other two <HI>Recoes</HI> were no &s;ooner come up to us, but being &s;tayed and &s;ea&s;ed on, one of the chiefe Carriers, a very &s;en&s;ible fellow, told our Captaine by what meanes we were di&s;covered, and coun&s;elled us to &s;hift for our &s;elves betimes, unle&s;&s;e we were able to encounter the whole force of the City and Country which before day would be about us.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed us but little that we were defeated of our Golden <HI>Recoe,</HI> and that in the&s;e we could not find pa&s;t &s;ome two Hor&s;e-load of Silver: but it grieved our Cap|taine much more, that he was di&s;covered, and that by one of his owne men. But knowing it bootle&s;&s;e to grieve at things pa&s;t, and having learned by experience, that all &s;afety in extremeties con&s;i&s;teth in taking of time: after no long con&s;ultation with <HI>Pedro</HI> the chiefe of our <HI>Syme|rons,</HI> who declared that there were but two wayes for him: the one to travell back againe the &s;ame &s;ecret way they came, for foure leagues &s;pace into the Woods: or el&s;e to march forward by the high way to <HI>&V;enta Cruz,</HI> being two leagues, and make a way with his Sword thorow the Enemies. He re&s;olved; con&s;idering the long and weary Marches that we had taken, and chiefly that la&s;t evening and day before: to take now the &s;hor|te&s;t and readie&s;t way; as choo&s;ing rather to encounter his Enemies while he had &s;trength remaining, then to be Encountered or cha&s;ed when we &s;hould be worne out vvith vvearine&s;&s;e; principally, now having the Moyles to ea&s;e them that vvould, &s;ome part of the vvay.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="34">Therefore commanding all to refre&s;h them&s;elves moderately with &s;uch &s;tore of Victuall, as we had there in aboundance, he &s;ignified his re&s;olution and rea&s;on to them all: asking <HI>Pedro</HI> by name, whether he would give his hand not to for&s;ake him (becau&s;e he knew that the re&s;t of the <HI>Symerons</HI> would al&s;o then &s;tand fa&s;t and firme, &s;o faithfull are they to their Captaine.) He being very glad of his re&s;olution, gave our Captaine his hand, and vowed that he would rather dye at his foot, then leave him to the Enemies, if he held this cour&s;e.</P>
<P>So having &s;trengthned our &s;elves for the time, we tooke our journey towards <HI>&V;enta Cruz,</HI> with helpe of the Moyles, till we came within a mile of the Towne, where we turned away the <HI>Recoes,</HI> charging the Con|ducters of them, not to follow us upon paine of their lives.</P>
<P>There the way is cut thorow the Woods, about tenne or twelve foot broad, &s;o as two <HI>Recoes</HI> may pa&s;&s;e one by another. The fruitfulne&s;&s;e of the &s;oyle cau&s;eth that with often &s;hredding and ridding the way tho&s;e Woods grow as thicke as our thicke&s;t hedges in <HI>England</HI> that are oftne&s;t cut.</P>
<P>To the mid&s;t of this Wood, a Company of Souldiers which continually lay in that Towne, to defend it a|gain&s;t the <HI>Simerons</HI> were come forth, to &s;top us if they might on the way, if not to retrait to their &s;trength, and there to expect us. A Convent of Fryers, of whom one was become a Leader, joyned with the&s;e Souldiers, to take &s;uch part as they did.</P>
<P>Our Captaine under&s;tanding by our two <HI>Simerons,</HI> which with great hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fulne&s;&s;e and &s;ilence, marched now, but above halfe a flight-&s;hot before us, that it vvas

time for us to arme and take us to our weapons, for they knew the Enemy was at hand, by &s;melling of their match and hearing of a noi&s;e: had given us charge that no one of us &s;hould make any &s;hot, untill the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had fir&s;t &s;pent their volley, which he thought they would not doe before they had &s;poken, as indeed fell out: For as &s;oone as we were within hearing, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captaine cried a|loud, H&oacute;&oacute;, our Captaine an&s;wered him likewi&s;e, and being demanded, <HI>Que gente</HI>? replied <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> But when the &s;aid Commander charged him in the name of the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> his Ma&s;ter, that we &s;hould yeeld our &s;elves, promi&s;ing in the word and faith of a Gentleman Souldier, that if he would &s;o do, he would u&s;e us with all courte&s;ie; our Captaine drawing &s;omewhat neere him, &s;aid; That for the honour of the Queene of <HI>England</HI> his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e, he mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;age that way: and there|withall di&s;charged his Pi&s;tol towards him.</P>
<P>Upon this, they pre&s;ently &s;hot off their whole volly, which, though it lightly wounded our Captaine and diver&s;e of our men, yet it cau&s;ed death to one onely of our Company called <HI>John Harris,</HI> who was &s;o powdered with Haile-&s;hot (which they all u&s;ed for the mo&s;t part as it &s;eemed, or el&s;e quartered, for that our men were hurt with that kinde) that we could not recover his life, though he continued all that day afterwards with us. Pre&s;ently as our Captaine perceived their &s;hot to come &s;lacking, as the latter drops of a great &s;hewer of raine; with his Whi&s;tle he gave us his u&s;uall &s;ignall, to an&s;wer them with our &s;hot and arrowes, and &s;o march onwards upon the Enemy, with intent to come to handy-&s;trokes, and to have joyned with them: whom when he &s;ound retired as to a place of &s;ome better &s;trength, he encrea|&s;ed his pace to prevent them if he might. Which the

<HI>Symerons</HI> perceiving (although by terror of the &s;hot con|tinuing) they were for the time &s;tept a &s;ide, yet as &s;oone as they di&s;cerned by hearing that we marched onward, they all ru&s;ht forwards one after another, traver&s;ing the way, with their Arrowes ready in their Bowes, and their manner of Countrey Dance or Leape, very lu&s;tily, &s;ing|ing <HI>Y&oacute; peh&oacute;, Y&oacute; peh&oacute;,</HI> and &s;o got before us, where they con|tinued their Leape and Song, after the manner of their owne Countrey Warres, till they and we over-tooke &s;ome of the Enemy, who neere the Townes-end had conveyed them&s;elves within the Woods, to have taken their &s;tand at us, as before.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Symerons</HI> now throughly encouraged, when they &s;aw our re&s;olution, brake in thorow the thick&s;t, on both &s;ides of them, forcing them to flye, Fryers and all, although divers of our Men were wounded, and one <HI>Symeron</HI> e&s;pecially was runne thorow with one of their Pikes, who&s;e courage and minde &s;erved him &s;o well not|with&s;tanding, that he revenged his owne death ere he dyed, by killing him that had given him that deadly wound.</P>
<P>We with all &s;peed, following this Cha&s;e, entred the Towne of <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> being of about forty or fifty Hou|&s;es, which had both a Governour and other Officers, and &s;ome faire Hou&s;es, with many Store-hou&s;es large and &s;trong for the Wares which were brought thither from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> by the River of <HI>Chagro,</HI> &s;o to be tran&s;por|ted by Moyles to <HI>Panama,</HI> be&s;ides the Mona&s;tery, where we found above a thou&s;and Buls and Pardons newly &s;ent thither from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>In tho&s;e Hou&s;es we found three Gentlewomen, which had lately beene delivered of Children there, though their dwelling were in <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> becau&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="36">
it hath beene ob&s;erved a long time, as they reported to us, that no <HI>Spaniards</HI> or White Woman could ever be de|livered in <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> with &s;afety of their Children, but that within two or three dayes they dyed; notwith|&s;tanding that being borne and brought up in this <HI>Venta Cruz</HI> or <HI>Panama</HI> five or &s;ix yeares, and then brought to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> if they e&s;caped &s;ickne&s;&s;e the fir&s;t or &s;e|cond Moneth, they commonly lived in it as healthily as in any other place; although no Stranger (as they &s;ay) can endure there any long time, without great danger of death or extreame &s;ickne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Though at our fir&s;t comming into the Towne with Armes &s;o &s;uddenly, the&s;e Gentlewomen were in great feare; yet becau&s;e our Captaine had given &s;traight charge to all the <HI>Symerons</HI> (that while they were in his Company, they &s;hould never hurt a Woman, nor Man that had not weapon in his hand to doe them hurt, which they earne&s;t|ly promi&s;ed, and no le&s;&s;e faithfully performed) they had no wrong offered them, nor any thing taken from them, to the worth of a garter; wherein, albeit they had in|deede &s;ufficient &s;afety and &s;ecurity, by tho&s;e of his Company, which our Captaine &s;ent unto them, of purpo&s;e to comfort them; yet they never cea&s;ed mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreating, that our Captaine would vouch&s;afe to come to them him&s;elfe for their more &s;afety: which when he did, in their pre&s;ence reporting the charge he had fir&s;t given, and the a&s;&s;urance of his Men, they were comforted.</P>
<P>While the Guards which we had (not without great neede) &s;er, as well on the Bridge which we were to pa&s;&s;e over, as at the Townes end where we entred (they have no other entrance into the Towne by Land, but from the Waters &s;ide there is one other, to carry up and
<PB N="65" REF="36">
downe their Merchandi&s;e from their Frigates) gained us liberty and quiet to &s;tay in this Towne &s;ome houre and halfe; we had not onely refre&s;hed our &s;elves, but our Company and <HI>Symerons</HI> had gotten &s;ome good Pillage, which our Captaine allowed and gave them (being not the thing he looked for) &s;o that it were not too cumber|&s;ome or heavy in re&s;pect of our travell, or defence of our &s;elues. A little before we departed, &s;ome ten or twelue Hor&s;emen came from <HI>Panama,</HI> by all likelihood, &s;uppo|&s;ing that we were gone out of this Town, for that all was &s;o &s;till and quiet, came to enter the Towne confidently; but finding their entertainment &s;uch as it was, they that could, rode fa&s;ter back againe for fear, then they had rid|den forwards for hope.</P>
<P>Thus we having ended our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e in this Towne, and the day beginning to &s;pring, we Marched over the Bridge, ob&s;erving the &s;ame order that we did before. There we were all &s;afe in our opinion, as if we had been environed with Wall and Trench; for that no <HI>Spaniard</HI> without his extreame danger could follow us. The ra|ther now, for that our <HI>Symerons</HI> were growne very va|liant. But our Captaine con&s;idering that he had a long way to pa&s;&s;e, and that he had bin now well neer fortnight from his Ship, where he had left his Company but weake by rea&s;on of their &s;ickne&s;&s;e, ha&s;tned his Journies as much as he might, refu&s;ing to vi&s;it the other <HI>Symeron</HI> Townes (which they earne&s;tly de&s;ired him) and encou|raging his owne Company with &s;uch example and &s;peech, that the way &s;eemed much &s;horter. For He Marched mo&s;t cheerfully, and a&s;&s;ured us, that he doubt|ed not but ere he left that Coa&s;t, we &s;hould all be boun|tifully paid and recompen&s;ed for all tho&s;e paines taken. But by rea&s;on of this our Captaines ha&s;te, and leaving
<PB N="66" REF="37">
of their Townes, we marched many dayes with hun|gry &s;tomackes, much again&s;t the will of our <HI>Symerons</HI>; Who if we would have &s;tayed any day from this con|tinuall journeying, would have killed for us Victuall &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In our ab&s;ence, the re&s;t of the <HI>Symerons</HI> had built a little Towne within three leagues off the Port where our Ship lay. There our Captaine was contented, upon their great and earne&s;t intreaties, to make &s;ome &s;tay; for that they alleadged, it was onely built for his &s;ake. And indeed he con&s;ented the rather, that the want of Shooes might be &s;upplyed by meanes of the <HI>Sy|merons,</HI> who were a great helpe unto us: all our Men complaining of the tenderne&s;&s;e of their feet, whom our Captaine would him&s;elfe in their complaint accompany &s;ometimes without cau&s;e, but &s;ometimes with cau&s;e indeed, which made the re&s;t to beare the burthen the more ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Symerons,</HI> during all the time that we were with them, did us continually very good &s;ervice, and in parti|cular in this Journey, being unto us in&s;tead of Intelligen|cers, to adverti&s;e us; of Guides in our way, to direct us; of Purveyors, to provide Victuals for us; of Hou&s;e|wrights to build our Lodgings; and had indeed able and &s;trong Bodies, carying all our nece&s;&s;aries; yea, many times when &s;ome of our Company fainted with &s;ickne&s;&s;e or wearine&s;&s;e, two <HI>Symerons</HI> would carry him with ea&s;e be|tween them two miles together; and at other times, when need was, they would &s;hew them&s;elves no le&s;&s;e valiant then indu&s;trious, and of good judgment.</P>

<P>Thereupon the Ma&s;ter lookt upon it, and &s;avv vvritten, <HI>By me Francis Drake,</HI> vvherefore he beleeved, and according to the me&s;&s;age, prepared vvhat provi|&s;ion he could, and repaired to the mouth of the River of <HI>Tortugos,</HI> as the <HI>Symerons</HI> that vvent vvith him then named it.</P>
<P>That afternoone towards three a Clocke, vve vvere come downe to that River, not pa&s;t halfe an houre, be|fore vve &s;avv our Pinnace ready come to receive us; vvhich vvas unto us all a double rejoycing: fir&s;t, that vve &s;avv them, and next &s;o &s;oone: our Captaine vvith all our Company prai&s;ed God mo&s;t heartily, for that vve &s;aw our Pinnace and fellowes againe.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="38">We all &s;eemed to the&s;e who had lived at re&s;t and plenty all this while aboard, as men &s;trangely changed (our Captaine yet not much changed) in countenance and plight: and indeed our long fa&s;ting and &s;ore travell might &s;omewhat &s;ore pine and wa&s;te us: but the greefe we drew inwardly, for that we returned without that Gold and Trea&s;ure we hoped for, did no doubt &s;hew her print and foot&s;teps in our faces.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of our Men which were then mi&s;&s;ed, could not travell &s;o well as our Captaine, and therefore were left at the <HI>Indian</HI> new Towne:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Febr.</HI> 23.</NOTE> and the next day we tow|ed to another River in the bottome of the Bay and tooke them all aboard.</P>
<P>Thus being returned from <HI>Panama,</HI> to the great re|joycing of our Company, who were throughly revived vvith the report we brought from thence: e&s;pecially un|der&s;tanding our Captaines purpo&s;e, that he meant not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o leave off thus, but vvould once againe attempt the &s;ame journey, vvhereof they al&s;o might be partakers: our Captaine vvould not in the meane time &s;uffer this edge and forwardne&s;&s;e of his men to be dulled or reba|ted, by lying &s;till idely unimployed, as knowing right well by continuall experiences, that no &s;ickne&s;&s;e vvas more noy&s;ome to impeach any enterpri&s;e then delay and idlene&s;&s;e.</P>

affected? Some thought that it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eeke &s;upply of Victuals, that we might the better be a|ble to keepe our men clo&s;e and in health till our time came: and this was ea&s;ie to be compa&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e the Fri|gates with Victuall went without great defence, whereas the Frigates and Barkes with Trea&s;ure, for the mo&s;t part were wafted with great Ships and &s;tore of Souldiers. O|thers yet judged, we might better be&s;tow our time in intercepting the Frigates of Trea&s;ure: fir&s;t, for that our Magazines and Stor-hou&s;es of Victuall were rea&s;onably furni&s;hed, and the Countrey it &s;elfe was &s;o plentifull, that every man might provide for him&s;elfe if the wor&s;t befell: and Victuall might hereafter be pro|vided aboundantly as well as now: whereas the Trea|&s;ure never floteth upon the Sea, &s;o ordinarily as at this time of the Fleetes being there, which time in no wi&s;e may be neglected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Symerons</HI> being demanded al&s;o their opinion, for that they were experienced in the particularities of all the Townes thereabouts, as in which, &s;ome or o|ther of them had &s;erved: declared that by <HI>Veragua Sin|nior Pezoro</HI> &s;ometimes their Ma&s;ter from whom they fled, dwelt not in the Towne for feare of &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, but yet not farre off from the Towne, for his better re|leefe: in a very &s;trong Hou&s;e of &s;tone, where he had dwelt nineteene yeeres at lea&s;t, never travelling from home, unle&s;&s;e happily once a year to <HI>Carthagene</HI> or <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> when the Fleetes were there: he keepeth a hundred Slaves at lea&s;t in the Mines, each Slave being bound to bring in dayly cleare gaine (all charges deducted) three Pezoes of Gold for him&s;elfe and two for his women (eight &s;hilligs three pence the Pezo) amounting in the whole, to above two hun|dred

And as touching meanes of compa&s;&s;ing this purpo&s;e, they would conduct him &s;afely thorow the Woods, by the &s;ame wayes by which they fled, that he &s;hould not need to enter their Havens with danger, but might come upon their backs alto|gether unlooked for. And though his hou&s;e were of &s;tone, &s;o that it could not be burnt, yet if our Captaine would undertake the attempt, they would undermine and overthrow, or otherwi&s;e breake it open, in &s;uch &s;ort as we might have ea&s;ie acce&s;&s;e to his greate&s;t Trea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our Captaine having heard all their opinions, conclu|ded &s;o; that by dividing his Company, the two fir&s;t dif|ferent &s;entences, were both reconciled, both to be pra|cti&s;ed and put in ure. <HI>John Oxnam</HI> appointed in the <HI>Beare,</HI> to be &s;ent Ea&s;twards towards <HI>Tolou,</HI> to &s;ee what &s;tore of Victuals would come athwart his halfe, and him|&s;elfe would to the We&s;twards in the <HI>Minion,</HI> lye off and on the <HI>Cabezas,</HI> where was the greate&s;t trade and mo&s;t ordinary pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e which tran&s;ported Trea&s;ure from <HI>Veragua</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua</HI> to the Fleet: &s;o that no time might be lo&s;t, nor opportunity let &s;lip either for Victuall or Trea&s;ure.

<P>Therefore u&s;ing our <HI>Symerons</HI> mo&s;t courteou&s;ly, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing tho&s;e that were de&s;irous to goe to their Wives, with &s;uch Gifts and favours as were mo&s;t plea&s;ing, and entertaining tho&s;e &s;till aboord his Ships, which were con|tented to abide with the Company remaining, the Pin|naces departed, as was determined, the <HI>Minion</HI> to the We&s;t, the <HI>Beare</HI> to the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minion</HI> about the <HI>Cabezas</HI> met with a Frigate of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> in which was &s;ome Gold, and a <HI>Genoway</HI> Pi|lot, of which Nation there are many in tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, which had beene at <HI>Veragua</HI> not pa&s;t eight dayes before, he being very well entreated, certified our Captaine of the State of the Towne, and of the Harbour, and of a Frigate that was there ready to come forth within few dayes, aboard in which there was above a Million of Gold, offering to conduct him to it, if we would doe him his right, for that he knew the Channell very perfectly, &s;o that he could enter by night &s;afely without danger of the Sands and Shallowes (though there be but little Water) and utterly unde&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ryed, for that the Towne is five leagues within the Harbour, and the way by Land is &s;o farre about and difficult thorow the Woods, that though we &s;hould by any ca&s;ualty be di&s;cove|red, about the point of the Harbour, yet we might di&s;patch our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e and depart, before the Towne could have notice of our comming. At his being there, he perceived they had heard of <HI>Drakes</HI> being on the Coa&s;t, which had put them in great feare, as in all other places (<HI>Pezoro</HI> purpo&s;ing to remove him|&s;elfe to the South Sea) but there was nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one

to prevent him, their freare being &s;o great, that, as it is ac|cu&s;tomed in &s;uch ca&s;es, it excluded Coun&s;ell and bred de&s;paire.</P>
<P>Our Captaine conferring with his owne knowledge and former intelligences, was purpo&s;ed to have retur|ned to his Ship, to have taken &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Symerons</HI> which had dwelt with <HI>Sinior Pezoro,</HI> to be the more confirmed in this point. But when the <HI>Genoway</HI> Pilot was very earne&s;t to have the time gained, and warrant|ed our Captaine of good &s;peed, if we delayed not; he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Frigates &s;omewhat lighter, to ha&s;ten her journey, and with this Pilots advice, laboured with Sayle and Oares to get this Harbour, and to enter it by night accordingly; con&s;idering that this Frigate might now be gained, and <HI>Pezoros</HI> Hou&s;e attempted hereafter notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But when we were come to the mouth of the Harbour, we heard the report of two Chambers, and farther off about a league within the Bay, two other, as were an|&s;wering them. Whereby our <HI>Genowai&s;e</HI> Pilot conjectu|red that we were di&s;covered; for he a&s;&s;ured us, that this order had beene taken, &s;ince his la&s;t being there; by rea&s;on of the adverti&s;ement and charge, which the Gover|nour of <HI>Panama</HI> had &s;ent unto all the Coa&s;t, which even in their Beds lay in great and continuall fear of our Cap|taine, and therefore by all likelihood, maintained this kinde of Watch, at the charge of the rich Gnuffe <HI>Pezoro,</HI> for their &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Thus being defeated of this expectation, we found that it was not Gods will that we &s;hould enter at that time: the rather for that the Winde, which had all this time beene Ea&s;terly, came up to the We&s;tward, and in|vited us to returne againe to our Ship; where on &s;heere

Thur&s;day we met according to appointment with our <HI>Beare,</HI> and found that &s;he had be&s;towed her time to more profit then we had done. For &s;he had taken a Frigate in which there were ten men, whom they &s;et a &s;hoare; great &s;tore of <HI>Maiz,</HI> twenty eight fat Hogs, and two hundred Hennes. Our Captaine di&s;charged this Frigate of her lading, and becau&s;e &s;he was new, &s;trong, and of a good mould, the next day he tallowed her to make her a Man of Warre: di&s;po&s;ing all our Ordnance and pro|vi&s;ions that were fit for &s;uch u&s;e in her. For we had heard by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> la&s;t taken, that there were two little Gallies built in <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> to waft the <HI>Chagro</HI> Fleete to and fro, but were not yet both lanched: vvherefore he purpo&s;ed now to adventure for that Fleete. And to hearten his Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marc.</HI> 20.</NOTE> he fea&s;ted them that Ea&s;ter-day with great cheere and cheereful|ne&s;&s;e, &s;etting up his re&s;t upon that attempt.</P>
<P>The next day with the new tallowed Frigate of <HI>Tolou</HI> and his <HI>Beare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marc.</HI> 21.</NOTE> we &s;et &s;aile towards the <HI>Cativa|as,</HI> where about two dayes after we landed, and &s;tay|ed while noone: at what time &s;eeing a &s;ayle to the We&s;twards, as we deemed making to the Iland: we &s;et &s;ayle and plyed towards him, vvho de&s;crying us, bare with us, till he perceived by our confidence, that vve vvere no <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and conjectured that we were tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> of vvhom they had heard long be|fore.

Our Captaine &s;ent one aboord him vvith &s;ome releefe for the pre|&s;ent, vvilling him to follovv us to the next Port, vvhere he &s;hould have both Water and Victuals.

<P>This Captaine reported unto us the fir&s;t newes of the Ma&s;&s;acre at <HI>Paris,</HI> at the King of <HI>Navarres</HI> mar|riage on Saint <HI>Bartholomewes</HI> day la&s;t, of the Admi|rall of <HI>France</HI> &s;laine in his Chamber, and divers other Murthers; &s;o that he thought tho&s;e Frenchmen the hap|pie&s;t that were farthe&s;t from <HI>France</HI>; now no longer <HI>France</HI> but Fren&s;ie, even as if all <HI>Gaul</HI> were turned into Worme-wood and Gall. <HI>Italian</HI> practi&s;es having over-ma&s;tered the <HI>French</HI> &s;implicity.

Indeed he had &s;eventy Men, and we now but thirty one: his Ship was above eighty tun, and our Fri|gate not pa&s;t twenty, our Pinnace nothing neer ten tun; yet our Captaine thought this proportionable, in con&s;i|deration that not number of Men, but quality of their judgements and knowledge, were to be the principall actors herein; and the <HI>French</HI> Ship could doe no &s;ervice, nor &s;tand in any &s;teed to this enterpri&s;e which we inten|ded, and had agreed upon long before, both touching the time when it &s;hould take beginning, and the place where we &s;hould meet, namely at <HI>Rio Franci&s;co.</HI> Having thus agreed with Captaine <HI>Tetu,</HI> we &s;ent for the <HI>Symerians,</HI> as before was decreed; two of them were brought aboard our Ships, to give the <HI>French</HI> a&s;&s;urance of this agree|ment.</P>

<P>And thus knowing that the Cariages went now daily from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> we proceeded in covert through the Woods, towards the High-way that leadeth betweene them. It is five leagues accounted by Sea, be|tweene <HI>Rio Franci&s;co</HI> and <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI>; but that way which we marched by land, we found it above &s;eaven league. We marched, as in our former journey to <HI>Pa|nama,</HI> both for order and &s;ilence, to the great wonder of the <HI>French</HI> Captaine and Company, who prote&s;ted they knew not by any meanes how to recover the Pinnaces, if the <HI>Symerons</HI> (to whom what our Captaine commanded was a law, though they little regarded the <HI>French,</HI> as hav|ing no tru&s;t in them) &s;hould leave us: our Captain a&s;&s;u|red him, there was no cau&s;e of doubt of them, of whom he had had &s;uch former tryall. When we were come vvithin an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile of the Way, vve &s;tayed all night, refre&s;hing our &s;elves in great &s;tilne&s;&s;e in a mo&s;t con|venient place, vvhere vve heard the Carpenters, being ma|ny in number, vvorking upon their Ships, as they u&s;ually doe by rea&s;on of the great heat of the day in <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and might heare the Moyles comming from <HI>Pana|ma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 1.</NOTE> by rea&s;on of the advantage of the ground. The next morning, upon hearing of that great number of Bels, the <HI>Symerons</HI> rejoyced exceedingly, as though there could not have befallen them a more joyful accident, chiefly having been di&s;appointed before. Now they all a&s;&s;ured us, vve &s;hould have more Gold and Silver then all of us could beare away, as in truth it fell out. For there came three
<PB N="77" REF="42">
<HI>Recoes,</HI> one of fifty Moyles, the other two of &s;eventy each, every of vvhich caryed three hundred pound vvaight of Silver, vvhich in all amounted to neer thirty Tun. We putting our &s;elus in readine&s;&s;e, vvent down neer the Way to hear the Bels, vvhere vve &s;tayed not long, but vve &s;aw of vvhat Mettall they vvere made, and tooke &s;uch hold on the heads of the foremo&s;t and hindmo&s;t Moyles, that all the re&s;t &s;tayed and lay down, as their manner is.</P>
<P>The&s;e three <HI>Recoes</HI> were guarded with forty five Soul|diers, or thereabouts; fifteene to each <HI>Reco,</HI> which cau&s;ed &s;ome exchange of Bullets and Arrowes for a time; in which conflict the <HI>French</HI> Captaine was &s;ore wounded with Hayle &s;hot in the Belly, and one <HI>Symeron</HI> &s;lain. But in the end the&s;e Souldiers thought it the be&s;t way to leave their Moyles with us, and to &s;eeke for more helpe a|broad; in which meane time we tooke &s;ome paine to ea&s;e &s;ome of the Moyles, which were heavie&s;t loaden, of their carriages. And being weary, we were content with a few bars and quoits of Gold, as we could well car|ry: burying about fifteene tun of Silver, partly in the Boroughs which the great Land-crabs had made in the earth, and parrly under old trees which are fallen there|about, and partly in the Sand and Gravell of a River, not very deepe of water.</P>
<P>Thus when about this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e we had &s;pent &s;ome two houres, and had di&s;po&s;ed of all our matters, and were ready to March backe, the very &s;elfe &s;ame way that we came, we heard both Hor&s;e and Foot comming, as it &s;eemed to the Moyles, for they never followed us, after we were once entred the Woods; where the <HI>French</HI> Cap|taine, by rea&s;on of his wound, not able to travell farther, &s;tayed, in hope that &s;ome re&s;t would recover him better &s;trength. But after we had marched &s;ome two leagues,
<PB N="78" REF="43">
upon the <HI>French</HI> Souldiers complaint, that they mi&s;&s;ed one of their Men al&s;o, examination being made whether he were &s;laine or no; it was found that he had drunke much Wine, and over-lading him&s;elfe with Pillage, and ha&s;ting to goe before us, had lo&s;t him&s;elfe in the Woods. And as we afterwards knew, he was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that evening, and upon torture, di&s;covered unto them where we had hidden our Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We continued our March all that and the next day to|wards <HI>Rio Franci&s;co,</HI> in hope to meet our Pinnaces; but when we came thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apr.</HI> 2.3.</NOTE> looking out to Sea, we &s;aw &s;e|ven <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pinnaces, which had beene &s;earching all the Coa&s;ts thereabout. Whereupon we mightily &s;u&s;pected that they had taken or &s;poyled our Pinnaces, for that our Captaine had given &s;o &s;traight charge, that they &s;hould repaire to this place this after-noone from the <HI>Cabezas</HI> where they rode, whence to our &s;ight, the&s;e <HI>Spaniards</HI> Pinnaces did come.</P>
<P>But the night before, there had fallen very much raine, with much We&s;terly Winde, vvhich as it enforced the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to returne home the &s;ooner, by rea&s;on of the Storme; &s;o it kept our Pinnaces, that they could not keepe the appointment, becau&s;e the Winde was contra|ry, and blew &s;o &s;trong, that with their Oares they could all that day get but halfe the way. Notwith&s;tanding, if they had followed our Captaines direction in &s;etting forth over night, while the wind &s;erved, they had arri|ved at the place appointed with farre le&s;&s;e labour, but with farre more danger, becau&s;e that very day at noone, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Shallops mand out of purpo&s;e from <HI>Nom|bre de Dios,</HI> were come to this place to take our Pinna|ces? imagining where we were, after they had heard of our intercepting of the Trea&s;ure.

<PB N="79" REF="43">
the Shallops, feared lea&s;t having taken our Pinna|ces, they had compelled our men by torture, to confe&s;&s;e where his Frigate and Ships were. Therefore in this di&s;tre&s;&s;e and perplexity, the Company mi&s;doubting that all meanes of returne to their Country were cut off, and that their Trea&s;ure then &s;erved them to &s;mall purpo&s;e: our Captaine comforted and incouraged us all, &s;aying: We &s;hould venter no farther then he did, it was no time now to feare, but rather to ha&s;te to prevent that which was feared: if the Enemy have prevailed again&s;t our Pinnaces, which God forbid, yet they mu&s;t have time to &s;earch them, time to examine the Mariners; time to execute their re&s;olution after it is determined; before all the&s;e times be taken, we may get to our Ships if ye will, though not po&s;&s;ibly by land, becau&s;e of the Hils, Thic|kets and Rivers, yet by water. Let us therefore make a Raft with the trees that are here in readine&s;&s;e, as offring them&s;elves being brought downe the River, happily this la&s;t &s;torme, and put our &s;elves to Sea, I will be one, who will be the other? <HI>Iohn Smith</HI> offered him&s;elfe, and two <HI>Frenchmen</HI> that could &s;wim very well, de&s;ired they might accompany our Captaine, as did the <HI>Symeron</HI> likewi&s;e (who had been very earne&s;t with our Captaine to have marched by land though it were &s;ixteene dayes journey, and in ca&s;e the Ships had been &s;urprized, to have aboord alwayes with them) e&s;pecially <HI>Pedro,</HI> who yet was faine to be left behind, becau&s;e he could not row. The Raft was fitted and fa&s;t bound; a Sayle of a Bisket Sacke prepared; an Oate was &s;haped out of a young Tree to &s;erve in&s;tead of a Rudder, to direct their cour&s;e before the wind. At his departure he comforted the Company, by promi&s;ing, that if it plea&s;ed God, he &s;hould put his foot in &s;afety aboord his Frigate, he would
<PB N="80" REF="44">
God willing, by one meanes or other get them all a|board, in de&s;pite of all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Indies.</HI> In this manner putting off to the Sea, he &s;ayled &s;ome three leagues &s;itting up to the wa&s;te continually in wa|ter, and at every &s;urge of the wave to the armepits, for the &s;pace of &s;ix houres, upon this Raft, what with the parching of the Sunne, and what with the beating of the Salt water, they had all of them their skins much fret|ted away. At length God gave them the &s;ight of two Pinnaces turning towards them with much wind, but with farre greater joy to him, that could ea&s;ily conje|cture, and did cheerfully declare to tho&s;e three with him, that they were our Pinnaces, and that all was &s;afe, &s;o that there was no cau&s;e of feare. But &s;ee, the Pinnaces not &s;eeing this Raft, nor &s;u&s;pecting any &s;uch matter, by rea&s;on of the wind and night growing on, were forced to run into a cover behind the point, to take &s;uccour for that night: which our Captaine &s;eeing, and gathering, be|cau&s;e they came not forth againe, that they would An|chor there, put his Raft a &s;hoare, and ran by land a|bout the point, where he found them, who upon &s;ight of him, made as much ha&s;te as they could to take him and his Company aboord. For our Captain of purpo&s;e to try what ha&s;te they could and would make in extre|mity, him&s;elfe ran in great ha&s;te, and &s;o willed the other three with him, as if they had been cha&s;ed by the Ene|my: which they the rather &s;u&s;pected, becau&s;e they &s;avv &s;o few with him. And after his comming aboord, when, they demanding, how all his Company did? he an&s;wered coldly, well: they all doubted, that all went &s;carce well. But he willing to rid all doubts, and fill them with joy, tooke out of his bo&s;ome a Quoit of Gold, thanking God that our Voyage vvas made. And to the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> he de|clared,

<P>He being demanded vvhat vvas become of his Cap|taine and other fellow, &s;hewed that vvithin halfe an hour after our departure, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d over gotten them, and tooke his Captaine and other fellow: he onely e&s;|caped, by flight, having ca&s;t away all his Carriage, and among the re&s;t one Box of Jewels, that he might flye the &s;wifter from the Pur&s;uers: but his fellovv tooke it up and burthened him&s;elfe &s;o &s;ore, that he could make no &s;peed, as ea&s;ily he might otherwi&s;e, if he vvould have ca&s;t downe his Pillage, and laid a&s;ide his covetous mind; as for the Silver, vvhich we had hidden thereabout in the Earth and the Sands, he thought that it vvas all gone, for that he thought there had been neere two thou&s;and <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI> there, to dig and &s;earch for it. This report notwit&s;tanding, our purpo&s;e held, and our Men were &s;ent to the &s;aid place, where they found that the Earth, every way a mile di&s;tant had beene digged and turned up in every place of any likelihood, to have any thing hidden in it. And yet neverthele&s;&s;e, for all that narrow &s;earch, all our Mens labour was not quite lo&s;t: but &s;o con&s;idered, that the third day after their departure, they all returned &s;afe and cheerefull, with as much Silver as they and all the <HI>Symerons</HI> could finde, (<HI>viz.</HI> thirteene bars of Silver, and &s;ome few Quoits of Gold, vvith vvhich they were pre&s;ently embarqued vvith|out empeachment, repairing with no le&s;&s;e &s;peed then joy to our Frigate.

our Captaine concluded to vi&s;it <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> once a|gain; to &s;ee if he could meet with any &s;ufficient Ship or Barke, to carry Victual enough to &s;erve our turne home|wards, in which we might in &s;afety and &s;ecurity em|barque our &s;elves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Frenchmen</HI> having formerly gone from us as &s;oon as they had their &s;hares at our fir&s;t returne with the Trea|&s;ure, as being very de&s;irous to return home into their Country, and our Captaine as de&s;irous to di&s;mi&s;&s;e them, as they vvere to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: for that he fore&s;aw they could not in their Ship avoid the danger of being taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if they &s;hould make out any Men of Warre for them, while they lingred on the Coa&s;t, and having al&s;o been then againe releeved vvith Victuals by us: Now at our meeting of them againe, were very loath to leave us, and therefore accompanied us very kindly as far up as Saint <HI>Barnards,</HI> and farther would, but that they dur&s;t not adventure &s;o great danger, for that we had intelligence that the Fleet was ready to &s;et &s;ayle for <HI>Spaine,</HI> riding at the entry of <HI>Carthagena.</HI> Thus we departed from them, pa&s;&s;ing hard by <HI>Carthagena,</HI> in the &s;ight of all the Fleet, with a Flag of Saint <HI>George</HI> in the maine top of our Frigate, with &s;ilke Streamers and Ancients downe to the water, &s;ayling forward with a large wind, till we came within two leagues of the River, being all low land, and darke night: where to prevent the over &s;hooting of the River in the night, we lay off and on bearing &s;mall &s;ayle, till that about mid-night the wind veering to the Ea&s;tward, by two of the Clocke in the morning, a Frigate from <HI>Rio Grand</HI> pa&s;&s;ed hard by us, bearing al&s;o but &s;mall &s;ayle.

<P>Here we &s;tayed about a &s;even night, trimming and rig|ging our Frigates, boarding and &s;towing our Provi&s;ions, tearing abroad and burning our Pinnaces, that the <HI>Syme|rons</HI> might have the Iron-worke. About a day or two before our departure, our Captain willed <HI>Pedro</HI> and three of the chiefe&s;t of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> to goe through both his Frigates, to &s;ee what they liked, promi&s;ing to give it them what&s;oever it were, &s;o it were not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as that he could not returne into <HI>England</HI> without it.

of Gold, which yet he had in &s;tore, if he would but move our Captaine for it; and to our Captaine him&s;elfe, he would give foure other great quoits, which he had hid|den, intending to have re&s;erved them till another Voyage. Our Captain being accordingly moved by <HI>Francis Tuck|er,</HI> could have beene content to have made no &s;uch ex|change, but yet de&s;irous to content him, that had de&s;erv|ed &s;o well, he gave it him with many good words, who received it with no little joy, affirming that if he &s;hould give his Wife and Children (which he loved dearly) in liev of it, he could not &s;ufficiently recompence it, (for he would pre&s;ent his King with it, who he knew would make him a great Man, even for this very Gifts &s;ake) yet in gra|tuity and &s;teed of other requitall of this Jewell, he de&s;i|red our Captaine to accept the&s;e foure peeces of Gold, as a token of his thankfulne&s;&s;e to him, and a pawne of his faithfulne&s;&s;e during life. Our Captaine received it in mo&s;t kinde &s;ort, but tooke it not to his owne benefit, but cau&s;ed it to be ca&s;t into the whole Adventure, &s;aying, If he had not beene &s;et forth to that place, he had not attai|ned &s;uch a Commodity; and therefore it was ju&s;t, that they which bare part with him of his burthen in &s;et|ing him to Sea, &s;hould enjoy the proportion of his bene|fit what&s;oever, at his returne.</P>

This offer they &s;eemed mo&s;t gladly to accept, and promi&s;ed the next day to re&s;ort again, with &s;uch things as they had to exchange for ours.

be a wonderfull alteration in them, &s;ince that time, being fal|len from a &s;imple and naturall ereature, to make Gods of Di|vels; but I am of the mind, that it was with them then, as now it is, only they lacked then the like occa&s;ion, to put it in pra|cti&s;e, which now they have: for then, they lived as a free people among them&s;elves, but now, are in mo&s;t mi&s;erable bondage &amp; &s;lavery, both in body, goods, wife, and children, and life it &s;elf to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who&s;e hard and mo&s;t cruell dealings again&s;t them, forceth them to fly into the unfruitfull parts of their own land, rather there to &s;tarve, or at lea&s;t live mi&s;erably with liberty, then to abide &s;uch intollerable hondage, as they lay upon them, u&s;ing the afore&s;aid practi&s;es with Divels, both for a revenge again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, and al&s;o for a defence, that they have no further entrance into the country.

naked. Some paint one &s;houlder black, another white, and their &s;ides and legs interchangeably with the &s;ame colours, one &s;till contrary to the other. The black part hath &s;et upon it white moons, and the white part black Suns, being the marks and characters of their gods, as is before noted.</P>
<P>They have &s;ome commodity by painting of their bodies, for the which cau&s;e they u&s;e it &s;o generally: and that I gather to be the defence it yeildeth again&s;t the piercing and nipping cold. For the colours being clo&s;e laid on upon their skin, or ra|ther in the fle&s;h, as by continuall renewing of the&s;e juces which are layed on, &s;oakt into the inner part thereof, doth fill up the pores &s;o clo&s;e that no aire or cold can enter, or make them once to &s;hrink.</P>
<P>They have clean, comely, and &s;trong bodies: they are &s;wift of foot, and &s;eem very active. Neither is any thing more la|mentable (in my judgment) then that &s;o goodly a people, and &s;o lively creatures of God, &s;hould be ignorant of the true and living God. And &s;o much the more is this to be lamented, by how much they are more tractable, and ea&s;ie to be brought to the &s;heepfold of Chri&s;t: having in truth a land &s;ufficient to re|compence any chri&s;tian Prine in the world, for the whole tra|vell and labour, co&s;t and charges be&s;towed in that behalf: with a wonderfull enlarging of a kingdome, be&s;ides the glory of God by encrea&s;ing of the Church of C&s;tri&s;t.</P>
<P>Its wonderfull to hear, being never known to Chri&s;tians be|fore this time, how familiar they became in &s;hort &s;pace with us,; thinking them&s;elves to be joyned with &s;uch a people, as they ought rather to &s;erve, then offer any wrong or injury un|to: pre&s;uming that they might be bold with our generall as with a father, &amp; with us as with brethren &amp; their neer friends; neither &s;eemed their love le&s;&s;e towards us. One of the chiefe&s;t among them having on a time received a cap off our generals head, which he did daily weare, removing him&s;elf but a little from us, with an arrow pierced his legge deeply, cau&s;ing the bloud to &s;tream out upon the ground: &s;ignifying thereby, how

unfainedly he loved him, and giving therein a covenant of peace: the number of men which here did frequent our com|pany, were about fiftie per&s;ons. Within, in the Southermo&s;t part of this bay, there is a river of fre&s;h water, with a great many profitable I&s;lands; of which, &s;ome have alwaies &s;uch &s;tore of &s;eales or &s;ea-wolves as were able to maintain a huge army of men.

Of the&s;e we killed &s;ome with &s;hot, and &s;ome with &s;taves, and took &s;ome with our hands, from mens heads and &s;houlders upon which they ligh|ted. We could not perceive that the people of the country had had any &s;ort of boat or canow, to come to the&s;e I&s;lands. Their own provi&s;ion which they eat, for ought we could perceive, was commonly raw. For we &s;hould &s;ometimes find the rem|nants of Seales all bloudy which they had gnawn with their teeth like dogs: They go all of them armed with a &s;hort bow of about an ell in length in their hands, with arrows of reeds, and headed with a flint &s;tone, very cunningly cut and fa&s;tned.</P>
<P>This bay by rea&s;on of the plenty of Seals therein found (in|&s;omuch that we killed two hundred in the &s;pace of one hour) we called <HI>Seale bay.</HI> And having now made &s;ufficient provi&s;ion of victuals and other nece&s;&s;aries, as al&s;o happily fini&s;hed all our bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, <HI>June</HI> 3.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iune</HI> 3.</NOTE> we &s;et &s;aile from thence; and coa&s;ting along towards the pole Antartick <HI>June</HI> 12.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iune</HI> 12.</NOTE> we fell with a little bay, in which we anchored for the &s;pace of two dayes &s;pent in the di&s;charging of our Caunter, the <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> which we here layed up.</P>

<P>The 19. day of <HI>June</HI> toward night,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iune</HI> 19.</NOTE> having &s;ailed within a few leagues of port St. <HI>Julian,</HI> we had our &s;hip in &s;ight: for which we gave God thanks with mo&s;t joyfull minds.

Pre&s;antly upon his landing he was vi&s;ited by two of the inhabitants of the place, whom <HI>Magellane</HI> named <HI>Patagous</HI> or rather <HI>Pentagours</HI> from their huge &s;tature, and &s;trength pro|portionable: the&s;e as they &s;eemed greatly to rejoyce at his ari|vall, &s;o did they &s;hew them&s;elves very familiar, receiving at our generals hands what&s;oever he gave them, and taking great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing Ma&s;ter <HI>Oliver</HI> the ma&s;ter Gunner of the Ad|mirall, to &s;hoot an Engli&s;h arrow: trying with him to &s;hoot at at length, but came nothing neere him.</P>
<P>Not long after, came one more of the &s;ame la&s;te, but of a &s;owrer &s;ort, for he, mi&s;liking of the familiarity which his fel|lows had u&s;ed, &s;eemed very angey with them, and &s;trove earne|&s;tly to withdraw them, and turn them to become our enemies; Which our generall with his men not &s;u&s;pecting in them, u&s;ed them as before: and one Mr. <HI>Robert Winter,</HI> thinking of plea&s;ure to &s;hoot an arrow at length. as Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> had done before, that he which came la&s;t might have a &s;ight thereof, the &s;tring of his bow brake; which, as before it was a terror unto them, &s;o now broken, it gave them great incouragement, and boldne&s;s, and as they thought, great advantage in their treache|rous intent and purpo&s;e; not imagining that our callivers, &s;words, and targets, were any munition or weapon of war.</P>
<P>In which per&s;wa&s;ion (as the generall with his company were, puietly without any &s;u&s;pition of evill, going down to|wards his boat) they &s;uddainly being prepared, and gotten by &s;tealth behind him, &s;hot their arrows; and chiefly at him which had the bow, not &s;uffering him to &s;tring the &s;ame a|gain, which he was about to have done, as well as he could: but being wounded in the &s;houlder at the fir&s;t &s;hot, and turning

But the Mr. Gunner being ready to &s;hoot of his calli|ver, which took not fire in levelling thereof, was pre&s;ently &s;lain outringht. In this extremitie, if our general had not been both expert in &s;uch affaires, able to judge, and give pre&s;ent di|rection in the danger thereof, and had not valiantly thru&s;t him|&s;elf into the dance, again&s;t the&s;e mon&s;ters, there had not one of our men, that there were landed, e&s;caped with life.

For the piece being charged with a bullet, and haile &s;hot, and well aimed, tare out his belly and guts, with great torment, as it &s;eemed by his cry, which was &s;o hideous and horrible a roare, as if ten buls had joyned together in roaring, wherewith the courage of his partners was &s;o abated, and their hearts appa|led, that notwith&s;tanding, divers of their fellows and country|men appeared out of the woods, on each &s;ide yet they were glad, by flying away to &s;ave them&s;elves, quietly &s;uffering our men either to depart or &s;tay. Our generall cho&s;e rather to de|part, then to take further revenge of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich now he might, by rea&s;on of his wounded man, whom for many good parts he loved dearly; and therefore would rather have &s;aved him, then &s;lain an hundred enemies, but being pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t recovery, he dyed the 2. day after his being brought aboard again.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="63">That night our Mr. Gunners body being left a&s;hoare, for the &s;peedier bringing of the other aboard, our generall him&s;elf the next day, with his boate well appointed, returned to the &s;hore, to fetch it likewi&s;e&punc; which they found lying where it was left, but &s;tript off his uppermo&s;t garment, and having an Engli&s;h arrow &s;truck in his right eye.</P>
<P>Both of the&s;e dead bodies were laid together in one grave, with &s;uch reverence, as was fit for the earthen tabernacles of immortall &s;oules; with &s;uch commendable ceremonies, as be|long unto &s;ouldiers of worth, in time of war, which they mo&s;t truly and rightfully de&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Magellane</HI> was not altogether deceived, in naming of them Giants; for they generally differ from the common &s;ort of men, both in &s;tature, bigne&s;&s;e, and &s;trength of body, as al&s;o in the hideou&s;ne&s;&s;e of their voice: but yet they are nothing &s;o mon&s;trous, or Giantlike as they were reported; there being &s;ome Engli&s;h men, as tall as the highe&s;t of any that we could &s;ee, but peradventure, the Spaniards did not think, that ever any Engli&s;h man would come thither to repove them; and thereupon might pre&s;ume the more boldly to lie: the name <HI>Pentagones, five cubits, viz.</HI> 7. foot and half, de&s;cribing the full height (if not &s;ome what more) of the highe&s;t of them.</P>
<P>But this is certain, that the Spani&s;h cruelties there u&s;ed, have made them more mon&s;trous, in mind and manners, then they are in body; and more inho&s;pitable, to deale with any &s;trangers that &s;hal come hereafter. For the lo&s;s of their friends (the remembrance whereof is a&s;&s;igned and conveighed over from one generation to another, among their po&s;terity) breed|eth an old grudg, which will not ea&s;ily be forgotten, with &s;o quarrel&s;ome &amp; revengefull a people. Notwith&s;tanding the ter|ror which they had conceived of us, did henceforward &s;o quench their heat, &amp; take down their edge, that they both for|gat revenge, and &s;eeming by their countenance, to repent them of the wrong they had offered us, that meant them no harm, &s;uffered us to doe what we would, the whole &s;pace of
<PB N="29" REF="63">
two moneths after this, without any interruption or mole&s;ta|tion by them, and it may perhaps be a meanes to breed a peace in that people, towards all that may hereafter this, come that way.</P>
<P>To this evill, thus received at the hands of Infidels, there was adjoyned and grew another mi&s;chief, wrought and continued clo&s;ely among our &s;elves, as great, yea far greater, and of farre more grievous con&s;equence then the former: but that it was, by Gods providence, detected and prevented in time, which el&s;e had extended it &s;elf, not only to the violent &s;hedding of innocent bloud, by murthering our generall and &s;uch others as were mo&s;t firm and faithfull to him: but al&s;o to the finall over|throw of the whole action intended, and to divers other mo&s;t dangerous effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e plots have been laid before the voyage began in Eng|land: the very modell of them was &s;hewed and declared to our Generall in his garden at <HI>Plimmouth,</HI> before his &s;etting &s;aile, which yet he either would not credit, as true or likely, of a per&s;on whom he loved &s;o deerely, and was per&s;waded of to love him likewi&s;e unfainedly, or thought by love and benefits, to remove and remedy it, if there were any evill purpo&s;es con|ceived again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And therefore, he did not only continue (to this &s;u&s;pected &amp; accu&s;ed per&s;on) all countenance, credit, &amp; courte&s;ies, which he was wont to &s;hew and give him; but increa&s;ed them, u&s;ing him in a manner as another him&s;elf, and as his mo&s;t inmo&s;t friend: lodging him with him&s;elf; giving him the &s;econd place, in all companies, in his pre&s;ence; leaving in his hand, the &s;tate as it were of his own per&s;on, in his ab&s;ence; imparting unto him all his coun&s;ells; allowing him free liberty in all things that were rea&s;onable; and bearing often at his hands great infirmi|ties; yea, de&s;pi&s;ing that any private injury, &s;hould breake &s;o firm a friend&s;hip, as he meant towards him. And therefore, was he oftentimes not a little offended, even with tho&s;e, who upon con&s;cience of their duty, and knowledge that otherwi&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="64">
they &s;hould indeed offend) di&s;clo&s;ed from time to time unto him, how the fire increa&s;ed, that threatned his own, together with the de&s;truction of the whole action.</P>
<P>But at length, perceiving that his lenity and favours did little good; in that the heat of ambition was not yet allayed, nor could be quenched, as it &s;eemed, but by bloud; and that the manifold practi&s;es grew dayly more and more, even to extre|mities; he thought it high time, to call the&s;e practi&s;es into que|&s;ton, before it were too late, to call any que&s;tion of them into hearing. And therefore &s;etting good watch over him, and a&s;|&s;embling all his Captains, and gentlemen of his company to|gether; he propounded to them, the good parts which were in the gentleman, the great good will, and inward affection, more then brotherly, which he had ever, &s;ince his fir&s;t acquaintance born him, not omitting the re&s;pect which was had of him, among no mean per&s;onages in <HI>England</HI>; and afterwards de|livered the letters, which were written to him, with the parti|culars from time to time, which had been ob&s;erved, not &s;o much by him&s;elf, as by his good friends; not only at &s;ea, but e|ven at <HI>Plimmouth</HI>; not bare words but writings; not writings a|lone, but actions, tending to the overthrow of the &s;ervice in hand, and making away of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Proofs were required and alleadged, &s;o many, and &s;o evident, that the Gentleman him&s;elf, &s;tricken with remor&s;e of his in|con&s;iderate and unkind dealing, acknowledged him&s;elf to have de&s;erved death, yea many deaths; for that he con&s;pired, not only the overthrow of the action, but of the principall Actor al&s;o, who was not a &s;tranger or ill-willer, but a deare and true friend unto him: and therefore in a great a&s;&s;embly openly be&s;ought them, in who&s;e hands ju&s;tice re&s;ted, to take &s;ome or|der for him; that he might not be compelled, to enforce his own hands, again&s;t his own bowels, or otherwi&s;e to become his own executioner.</P>
<P>The admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment hereat, in all the hearers even tho&s;e which were his neere&s;t friends, and mo&s;t affected
<PB N="31" REF="64">
him was great, yea in tho&s;e, which for many benefits received from him, had good cau&s;e to love him: but yet the generall was mo&s;t of all di&s;tracted; and therefore withdrew him&s;elf, as not able to conceale his tender affection, requiring them that had heard the whole matter, to give their judgements, as they would another day an&s;wer it unto their Prince, and unto Al|mighty God, judge of all the earth. Therefore they all, above 40. in number, the chiefe&s;t in place and judgment in the whole fleet, after they had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed diver&s;ly of the ca&s;e, and alledged what&s;oever came in their mindes, or could be there produced by any of his other friends, with their own hands, under &s;eale adjuged that: <HI>He had de&s;erved death: and that it &s;tood, by no means with their &s;afety, to let him live: and therefore, they remitted the manner thereof, with the re&s;t of the circum&s;tances to the generall.</HI></P>
<P>This judgement, and as it were a&s;&s;ize, was held a land, in one of the I&s;lands of that port; which afterwards, in memory here|of was called, the I&s;land of <HI>true ju&s;tice and judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Now after this verdict was thus returned unto our generall (unto whom, for his company, her Maje&s;ty before his depar|ture, had committed her &s;word, to u&s;e for his &s;afety, with this word: <HI>We do account that he which &s;triketh at thee Drake, &s;triketh at us</HI>) he called for the guilty party, and cau&s;ed to be read unto him, the &s;everall verdicts which were written, &amp; propounded of him, which being acknowledg'd for the mo&s;t part (for none had given heavier &s;entence again&s;t him, then he had given a|gain&s;t him&s;elf, our Generall propo&s;ed unto him this choyce: <HI>Whether he would take to be executed in this I&s;land? or to be &s;et a land on the main? or return into England, there to an&s;wer his deed before the Lords of her Maje&s;ties Coun&s;ell?</HI></P>
<P>He mo&s;t humbly thanked the Generall for his clemency, ex|tended towards him in &s;uch ample &s;ort: and craving &s;ome re|&s;pit to con&s;ult thereon, and &s;o make his choyce advi&s;edly: the next day he returned this an&s;wer, that, <HI>Albeit he had yeelded in his heart, to entertain &s;o great a &s;in; as whereof now he was ju&s;tly condemned: yet he had a care, and that excelling all other cares,
<PB N="32" REF="65">
to dye a chri&s;tian man, that what&s;oever did become of his clay body, he might remain a&s;&s;ured of an eternall inheritance, in a far better life. This he feared, if he &s;hould be &s;et a land among Infidels, how he &s;hould be able to maintain this a&s;&s;urance, feeling in his own frail|tie, how mighty the contagion is of lewd cu&s;tome.</HI> And therefore he be&s;ought the Generall mo&s;t earne&s;tly, that <HI>he would yet have a care, and regard of his &s;oul; and never jeapard it among&s;t hea|then and &s;avage Infidels. If he &s;hould return into England, he mu&s;t fir&s;t have a &s;hip, and men to conduct it, with &s;ufficient victu|als: two of which though they were had, yet for the third, he thought no man would accompanie him, in &s;o &s;ad a me&s;&s;age, to &s;o vile an i&s;|&s;ue, from &s;o honourable a &s;ervice. But if that there were, which could induce their minds, to return with him; yet the very &s;hame of the return, would be as death, or grievou&s;er if it were po&s;&s;ible: becau&s;e he &s;hould be &s;o long a dying, and dye &s;o often. Therefore he profe&s;|&s;ed, that with all his heart, he did imbrace the first branch of the Generals proffer; de&s;iring only his favour, that they might receive the holy communion, once again together before his death; and that he might not dye other then a Gentlemans death.</HI></P>
<P>Though &s;undry rea&s;ons were u&s;ed by many to per&s;wade him to take either of the other wayes: yet when he remained re&s;o|lute in his former determination, both parts of his la&s;t reque&s;t were granted: and the next convenient day, a communion was celebrated, by <HI>Mr. Francis Fletcher,</HI> preacher and pa&s;tor of the fleet at that time. The Generall him&s;elf communicated in this &s;acred ordinance, with this condemned penitent Gentleman; who &s;hewed great tokens of a contrite and repentant heart, as who was more deeply di&s;plea&s;ed with his own act, then any man el&s;e. And after this holy repa&s;t, they denyed al&s;o at the &s;ame table together, as chearfully in &s;obriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime: each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if &s;ome jour|ney only had been in hand.</P>
<P>After dinner, all things being brought in readine&s;s, by him that &s;upplyed the room of the provo&s;t Mar&s;hall; without any
<PB N="33" REF="65">

<P>Not many leagues therefore to the &s;outhwards of our for|mer anchoring, we ran in again among the&s;e I&s;lands; where we had once more better likelihood to re&s;t in peace: and &s;o much the rather, for that we found the people of the country travelling for their living, from one I&s;land to another, in their canows, both men, women, and young infants wrapt in skins, and hanging at their mothers backs; with whom he had tra|fique for &s;uch things as they had, as chains of certain &s;hels and &s;uch other trifles; here the Lord gave us three days to breath our &s;elves, and to provide &s;uch things as we wanted, albeit the &s;ame was with continuall care, and troubles to avoid im|minent dangers, which the troubled &s;eas and blu&s;tering winds did every hour threaten unto us.</P>

<P>We found this part of <HI>Peru,</HI> all along&s;t to the height of <HI>Lima</HI> which is 12. deg.

<P>After we were once again thus fallen with the land, we con|tinually coa&s;ted along, til we came to the height of 37. deg. or thereabout: &amp; finding no convenient place of abode, nor like|lihood to hear any news of our &s;hips, we ran off again with an I&s;land, which lay in &s;ight, named of the <HI>Spaniards Mucho,</HI> by

<P>At this I&s;land coming to anchor, <HI>Novem.</HI> 25.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 25</NOTE> we found it to be a fruitfull place, and well &s;tored with &s;undry &s;orts of good things, as &s;heep, and other cattell, maize, which is a kinde of grain whereof they make bread, potatoes, with &s;uch other roots: be&s;ides that, it is thought to be wonderful rich in gold, and to want no good thing for the u&s;e of mans life. The inha|bitants are &s;uch <HI>Indians,</HI> as by the cruel &amp; mo&s;t extream dea|ling of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have been driven to fly from the maine, here to relieve and fortifie them&s;elves. With this people, our Generall thought it meet to have traffique, for frew victuals &amp; water: and for that cau&s;e, the very &s;ame night of our arrivall there, him&s;elf with divers of his company went a &s;hoare, to whom the people with great courte&s;ie came down, bringing with them &s;uch fruits and other victuals as they had, and two very fat &s;heep, which they gave our Generall for a pre&s;ent. In recompence whereof, we be&s;towed upon them again many good and nece&s;&s;ary things; &s;ignifying unto them, that the end of his coming was for no other cau&s;e, but by way of exchang to traffique with them for &s;uch things as we needed, and they could &s;pare: and in particular, for &s;uch as they had alreadie brought down upon us, be&s;ides fre&s;h water, which we de&s;ired of them. Herein they held them&s;elves well contented, and &s;ee|med to be not a little joyfull of our coming: appointing where we &s;hould the next morning have fre&s;h water at plea&s;ure, &amp; withall &s;ignifying that then al&s;o they would bring us down &s;uch other things as we de&s;ired to &s;erve our turns.</P>
<P>The next day therefore very early in the morning (all things being made ready for traffique, as al&s;o ve&s;&s;els prepar'd to bring the water) our generall taking great care for &s;o nece&s;&s;ary pro|vi&s;ion, repaired to the &s;hoare again; and &s;etting a land two of his men, &s;ent with them their <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icoes</HI> to the watering place a&s;&s;igned the night before.

our generall with the re&s;t of his company &s;hould not only be &s;tayed from re&s;cuing them, but al&s;o might fall (if it were po&s;|&s;ible) into their hands in like manner, they had layed clo&s;ely behind the rocks an ambu&s;hment of (as we gue&s;&s;ed) about 500 mer, armed and wel appointed for &s;uch a mi&s;chief. Who &s;ud|denly attempting their purpo&s;e (the rocks being very dange|rous for the boat, and the &s;ea-gate exceeding great) by &s;hoot|ing their arrows hurt &amp; wounded every one of our men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 30.</NOTE> before they could free them&s;elves, or come to the u&s;e of their weap|ons to do any good. The generall him&s;elf was &s;hot in the face, under his right eye, &amp; clo&s;e by his no&s;e, the arrow piercing a marvellous way in, under <HI>ba&s;is cerebri,</HI> with no &s;mall danger of his life; be&s;ides that, he was grievou&s;ly wounded in the head&punc; The re&s;t being nine per&s;ons in the boat, were deadly wounded in divers parts of their bodies, if God almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly had not given cure to the &s;ame. For our chief Surgeon being dead and the other ab&s;ent by the lo&s;s of our vice-admirall, and ha|ving none left us but a boy, who&s;e good will was more then a|ny skil he had, we were little better then altogether de&s;titute of &s;uch cunning &amp; helps as &s;o grievous a &s;tate of &s;o many woun|ded bodies did require.

<P>The cau&s;e of this force and injury by the&s;e <HI>Ilanders,</HI> was no other but the deadly hatred which they bear again&s;t their civil enemies the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for the bloudy and mo&s;t tirannous op|pre&s;&s;ion which they had u&s;ed towards them. And therefore with purpo&s;e again&s;t them (&s;u&s;pecting us to be <HI>Spaniards</HI> in|deed, and that the rather, by occa&s;ion that though command was given to the contrary, &s;ome of our men in demanding wa|ter, u&s;ed the &s;pani&s;h word <HI>aqua,</HI> &s;ought &s;ome part of revenge a|gain&s;t us.

The weapons which this people u&s;e in their wars, are arrows of Reeds, with heads of &s;tone, very brittle and indented, but darts of a great length, headed with iron or bone.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day that we receiv'd this dangerous affront, in the afternoon we &s;et &s;aile from thence; and becau&s;e we were now nigh the appointed height, wherein our &s;hips were to be look|ed for, as al&s;o the extremity and cra&s;ie &s;tate of our hurt men advi&s;ing us to u&s;e expedition, to finde &s;ome convenient place of repo&s;e, which might afford them &s;ome re&s;t, and yeild us ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upply of fre&s;h victuals for their diet; we bent our cour&s;e, as the wind would &s;uffer us, directly to run in with the main.

<P>Our boat doing her utmo&s;t endeaver in a diligent &s;earch, yet after long travel could find no appearance of hope for relief, either of fre&s;h victuals, or of fre&s;h water: huge heads of wilde buffs they might di&s;cern, but not &s;o much as any &s;ign of any inhabitant thereabout. Yet in their return to us, they de&s;cryed within the bay, an Indian with his Canow as he was a fi&s;hing: him they brought aboard our generall, canow and all as he was in it.

In the time of which prayers, &s;inging of p&s;alms, and read|ing of certain chapters in the Bible, they &s;ate very attentively; and ob&s;erving the end of every pau&s;e, with one voyce &s;till cry|ed, oh, greatly rejoycing in our exerci&s;es.

<P>Our generall having now be&s;towed upon them divers things, at their departure they re&s;tored them again, none carrying with him any thing of what&s;oever he had received, thinking them&s;elves &s;ufficiently enriched and happy, that they had found &s;o free acce&s;&s;e to &s;ee us.</P>

convenient di&s;tance round about. Among&s;t the re&s;t, the King him&s;elf, a man of a goodly &s;tature and comely per&s;onage, at|tended with his guard, of about 100. tall and warlike men, this day. <HI>viz. June</HI> 26. came down to to &s;ee us.</P>
<P>Before his coming, were &s;ent twe Amba&s;&s;adors or me&s;&s;en|gers, to our generall, to &s;ignifie that their <HI>Hioh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iune</HI> 26.</NOTE> that is their K. was coming and at hand. They in the delivery of their me&s;|&s;age, the one &s;pake with a &s;oft and low voyce, prompting his fellow: the other pronounced the &s;ame word by word after him, with a voyce more audible: continuing their proclimati|on (for &s;uch it was) about half an houre. Which being ended, they by their &s;igns made reque&s;t to our General, to &s;end &s;ome|thing by their hands to their <HI>Hioh</HI> or King, as a token that his coming might be in peace. Our generall willingly &s;atisfyed their de&s;ire; and they glad men, made &s;peedy return to their <HI>hioh.</HI> Neither was it long before their K (making as princely a &s;hew as po&s;&s;ibly he could) with all his train came forward.</P>
<P>In their coming forwards they cryed continually after a &s;inging manner, with a lu&s;ty courage. And as they drew neerer and neerer towards us, &s;o did they more &amp; more &s;trive to be|have them&s;elves with a certain comline&s;&s;e and gravity in all their actions.</P>
<P>In the forefront came a man of a large body and goodly a&s;|pect, bearing the Septer or royall mace (made of a certain kind of black wood, and in length about a yard and a halfe) before the King. Whereupon hanged two crowns, a bigger and a le&s;&s;e, with three chains of a mavellous length, and often doubled; be&s;ides a bag of the herb <HI>Tabah.</HI> The crowns were made of knitwork, wrought upon mo&s;t curiou&s;ly with Feathers of di|vers colours, very artificiall placed, and of a formal fa&s;hion, The chains &s;eemed of a bony &s;ub&s;tance; every kinde or part thereof being very little, thin, mo&s;t finely burni&s;hed, with a hole pierced through the midde&s;t. The number of links going to make one chain, is in a manner infinite: but of &s;uch e&s;tima|tion it is among&s;t them, that few be the per&s;ons that are ad|mitted
<PB N="74" REF="86">
to weare the &s;ame: and even they to whom its lawfull to u&s;e them, yet are &s;tinted what number they &s;hall u&s;e; as &s;ome ten, &s;ome twelve, &s;ome 20. and as they exceed in number of chains, &s;o are they thereby known to be the more honourable per&s;onages.</P>
<P>Next unto him that bare this Scepter, was the King him&s;elf with his guard about him: his attire upon his head was a cawl of knitwork, wrought upon &s;omewhat like the crown, but differing much both in fa&s;hion and perfectne&s;&s;e of work, upon his &s;houlders he had on a coat of the skins of conies, reaching to his wa&s;t: his guard al&s;o had each coats of the &s;ame &s;hape, but of other skins, &s;ome having cawls likewi&s;e &s;uch with fea|thers, or covered over with a certain down, which groweth up in the country upon an herb much like our lectruce; which exceeds any other down in the world for finene&s;&s;e, and being layed upon their cawls by no winds can be removed: of &s;uch e&s;timation is this herb amon&s;t them, that the down thereof is not lawfull to be worn, but of &s;uch per&s;ons as are about the king (to whom al&s;o it is permitted to weare a plume of Fea|thers on their heads in &s;ign of honour) and the &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are not u|&s;ed but only in &s;acrifice to their gods. After the&s;e in their or|der, did follow the naked &s;ort of common people; who&s;e hair being long, was gathered into a bunch behind, in which &s;tuck plumes of Feathes, but in the forepart only &s;ingle Feathers like horn, ever one plea&s;ing him&s;elf in his own device.</P>
<P>This one thing was ob&s;erved to be generall amon&s;t them all, that every one had his face painted, &s;ome with white, &s;ome with black, and &s;ome with other colors, every man al&s;o bring|ing in his hand one thing or other for a pre&s;ent: their train or la&s;t part of their company con&s;i&s;ted of women and children, each woman bearing again&s;t her bre&s;t a round basket or two, having with them divers things, as bags of <HI>Tabah,</HI> a root which they call <HI>Petah,</HI> whereof they make a kind of meale, and ei|ther beake it into bread, or eate it raw; broyled fi&s;hes like a pilchard; the &s;eeed and down afore named, with &s;uch like.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">Their baskets were made in fa&s;hion like a deep boale, and though the matter were ru&s;hes, or &s;uch other kind of &s;tuff, yet was it &s;o cunningly handled, that the mo&s;t part of them would hold water; about the brims they were hanged with pieces of the &s;hels of pearls, and in &s;ome places with two or three links at a place, of the chains forenamed: thereby &s;ignifying that they were ve&s;&s;els wholly dedicated to the ontly u&s;e of the gods they wor&s;hiped: and be&s;ides this, they were wrought up|on with the matted down of red Feathers, di&s;tingui&s;hed into divers works and forms.</P>
<P>In the mean time our Generall having a&s;&s;embled his men to|gether (as foreca&s;ting the danger, and wor&s;t that might fall out) prepared him&s;elf to &s;tand upon &s;ure ground, that we might at all times be ready in our own defence, if any thing &s;hould chance otherwi&s;e then was looked for or expected.</P>
<P>Wherefore every man being in a warlike readine&s;s, he mar|ched within his fenced place, making again&s;t their approach a mo&s;t warlike &s;hew (as he did al&s;o at all other times of their re&s;ort) whereby if they had been de&s;perat enemies, they could not have cho&s;en, but have conceived error and feare, with di&s;|couragement to attempt any thing again&s;t us, in beholding of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When they were come &s;omewhat neere unto us, trooping together, they gave us a common or a generall &s;alutation: ob|&s;erving in the mean time a generall &s;ilence. Whereupon he who bare the Scepter before the king, being prompted by a|nother whom the King a&s;&s;igned to that office, pronounced with an audible and manly voice, what the other &s;pake to him in &s;ecret: continuing, whether it were his oration or procla|mation, at the lea&s;t half an houre. At the clo&s;e whereof, there was a common <HI>Amen,</HI> in &s;ign of approbation given by every per&s;on: and the King him&s;elf with the whole number of men and women, the little children only remaining behind, came further down the hill, and as they came &s;et them&s;elves again in their former order&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="87">And being now come to the foot of the hill and neere our fort, the Scepter-bearer with a compo&s;ed countenance and &s;tately carriage, began a &s;ong, and an&s;werable thereunto, ob&s;er|ved a kind of mea&s;ures in a danc: whom the Ki. with his guard, and every &s;ort of per&s;on following, did in like manner &s;ing and daunce, &s;aving only the woman who danced but kept &s;i|lence. As they daunced they &s;till came on: and our Generall perceiving their plain and &s;imple meaning, gave order that they might freely enter without interruption within our bul|wark: where after they had entred, they yet continued their &s;ong, and daunce a rea&s;onable time: their women al&s;o follow|ing them with their wa&s;&s;aile boales in their hands, their bodies brui&s;ed, their faces torn, their dugs, brea&s;t, and other parts be|&s;potted with bloud, trickling down from the wounds, which with their nailes they had made before their coming.</P>
<P>After that they had &s;atisfyed or rather tyred them&s;elves in this manner, they made &s;igns to our generall to have him &s;it down; unto whom, both the king and divers others made &s;eve|rall orations, or rather indeed if we had under&s;tood them, &s;up|plications, that he would take the province and kingdome in|to his hand, and become their King and patron: making &s;igns that they would re&s;ign unto him their right and title in the whole land, and become his va&s;&s;als in them&s;elves and his po|&s;terities: which that they might make us indeed believe that it was their true meaning and intent; the King him&s;elf with all the re&s;t with one con&s;ent, and with a great reverence, joyfully &s;inging a &s;ong, &s;et the crown upon his head: enriched his neck with all their chains&punc; and offering unto him many other things honoured him by the name of <HI>Hyoh.</HI> Adding thereunto (as it might &s;eem) a &s;ong and a daunce of tryumph: becau&s;e they were not only vi&s;ited of gods (for &s;o they &s;till judged us to be) but the great and chief god was now become their god, their king and patron, and them&s;elves were become the only happy and ble&s;&s;ed people in all the world.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being &s;o freely offered, our Generall thought
<PB N="77" REF="87">
not meet to reject or refu&s;e the &s;ame: both for that we would not give them any cau&s;e of mi&s;tru&s;t, or di&s;liking of him (that being the only place, wherein at this pre&s;ent we were of ne|ce&s;&s;ity inforced to &s;eek relief of many things) and chiefly, for that he knew not to what good end God had brought this to pa&s;&s;e, or what honour or profit it might bring to our country in time to come.</P>
<P>Wherefore in the name and to the u&s;e of her mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, he took the Scepter, Crown and dignity of the &s;aid country into his hand: wi&s;hing nothing more then that it had layen &s;o fitly for her Maje&s;ty to enjoy, as it was now her pro|per own, and that the riches and trea&s;ure thereof (where with in the up-land countries i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> abounds) might with as great con|veniency be tran&s;ported, to the enriching of her kingdome here at home, as it is in plenty to be attained there: and e&s;peci|ally, that &s;o tractable and loving a people, as they &s;hewed them|&s;elves to be, might have meanes to have manife&s;ted their mo&s;t willing obedience the more under her, and by her meanes, as a mother and nur&s;e of the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> might by the preaching of the go&s;pel be brought to the right knowledge, and obedience of the true and ever living God.</P>
<P>The ceremonies of this re&s;igning, and receiving of the king|dome, being thus performed, and the common &s;ort but of men and women, leaving the king and his guard about him, with our generall, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves among our people, taking a diligent view or &s;urvey of every man; and finding &s;uch as plea|&s;ed their fancies (which commonly were the younge&s;t of us) they pre&s;ently enclo&s;ing them about, offered their &s;acrifices unto them, crying out with lamentable &s;hreeks and moanes, weeping and &s;cratching, and tearing their very fle&s;h off their faces with their nailes, neither were it the woman alone which did this, but even old men, roaring, and crying out, were as vi|olent as the women were.</P>
<P>We groaned in &s;pirit to &s;ee the power of Sathan &s;o far pre|vaile, in &s;educing the&s;e &s;o harmle&s;&s;e &s;oules, and laboured by all

<P>After that time had a little qualified their madnes, they then began to &s;hew &amp; make known unto us their griefs &amp; di|&s;ea&s;es which they carryed about them, &s;ome of them having old aches, &s;ome &s;hrunke &s;inews, &s;ome old &s;ores and cankred ul|cers, &s;ome wounds more lately received, and the like, in mo&s;t lamentable manner craving help and cure thereof from us: making &s;igns, that if we did but blow upon their griefs, or but touched the di&s;ea&s;ed places, they would be whole.</P>
<P>Their griefs we could not but take pitty on them, and to our own de&s;ire to help them: but that (if it plea&s;ed God to o|pen their eyes) they might under&s;tand we were but men and no gods, we u&s;ed ordinary means, as lotions, emplai&s;ters, and unguents mo&s;t fitly (as far as our skils could gue&s;&s;e) agreeing to the natures of their griefs, be&s;eeching God, if it made for his glory, to give cure to their di&s;ea&s;es by the&s;e means. The like we did from time to time as they re&s;orted to us.</P>
<P>Few were the dayes, wherein they were ab&s;ent from us, du|ring the whole time of our abode in that place: and ordinarily every third day, they brought their &s;acrifices, till &s;uch time, as they certainly under&s;tood our meaning, that we took no plea|&s;ure, but were di&s;plea&s;ed with them: whereupon their zeale a|bated, and their &s;acrificing, for a &s;ea&s;on, to our good liking cea&s;ed: notwith&s;tanding they continued &s;till to make their re|&s;ort unto us in great abundance, and in &s;uch &s;ort, that they oft|times forgat, to provide meate for their own &s;u&s;tenance; &s;o

<P>They are a people of a tractable, free, and loving nature, without guile or treachery; their bows and arrows (their on|ly weapons, and almo&s;t all their wealth) they u&s;e u&s;e very skil|fully, but yet not do any great harm with them, being by rea|&s;on of their weakene&s;s, more fit for children then for men, &s;ending the arrow far off, nor with any great force: and yet are the men commonly &s;o &s;trong of body, that which 2. or 3. of our men could hardly beare, one of them would take upon his back, and without grudging carry it ea&s;ily away, up hil and down hill an Engli&s;h mile together: they are al&s;o exceeding &s;wift in running, and of long continuance; the u&s;e whereof is &s;o familiar with them, that they &s;eldome goe, but for the mo&s;t part run.

<P>The&s;e Canowes comming neere our Ship in order, rowed round about us one after another; and the men as they pa&s;&s;e by us, did us a kind of homage with great &s;olemnity, the greate&s;t Per&s;onages beginning fir&s;t, with reverend countenance and be|haviour to bow their bodies even to the ground: which done, they put our owne me&s;&s;enger aboard us againe, and &s;ignified to us that their King (who him&s;elfe was comming) had &s;ent them before him to conduct our Ship into a better roade, de&s;iring a Halfer to be given them forth, that they might employ their &s;ervice as their King commanded, in towing our Ship therewith to the place a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The King him&s;elfe was not far behind, but he al&s;o with &s;ix grave and ancient Fathers in his Canow approching, did at once together with them, yeeld us a reverend kind of obey&s;ance in far more humble manner, then was to be expected; he was of a tall &s;tature, very corpulent and well &s;et together, of a ve|ry Princely and gratious countenance; his re&s;pect among&s;t his owne was &s;uch, that neither his Viceroy of <HI>Mutir</HI> aforenamed, nor any other of his Coun&s;ellors, dur&s;t &s;peake unto him but u|pon their knees, not ri&s;ing againe till they were licenced.</P>
<P>Who&s;e comming as it was to our Generall, no &s;mall cau&s;e of good liking, &s;o was he received in the be&s;t manner we could, an&s;werable unto his &s;tate: our Ordnance thundred, which we mixed with great &s;tore of &s;mall &s;hot, among which &s;ounding our trumpets and other in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, both of &s;till and loud noi&s;e, wherwith he was &s;o much delighted, that reque&s;ting our mu&s;ick to come into the Boat, he joyned his Canow to the &s;ame, &amp; was towed at lea&s;t a whole hour together, with the boat at the &s;terne of our Ship: Be&s;ides this our Generall &s;ent him &s;uch pre&s;ents, as he thought, might both requite his courte&s;ie already received, and worke a farther confirmation of that good liking and friend&s;hip already begun.</P>
<P>The King being thus in mu&s;icall paradi&s;e, and enjoying that

wherewith he was &s;o highly plea&s;ed; his brother named <HI>Moro</HI> with no le&s;&s;e bravery, then any of the re&s;t, accompanied al&s;o with a great number of gallant followers, made the like repair, and gave us like re&s;pect; and his homage done he fell a &s;terne of us, till we came to anchor&punc; neither did our Generall leave his courte&s;ie unrewarded, but bountifully plea&s;ed him al&s;o be|fore we parted.</P>

<P>Accordingly the &s;ame night, and the morrow following, we received what was there to be had, by way of traffique, <HI>to wit,</HI> Rice in pretty quantity, Hens, Sugar-canes, imperfect and li|quid Sugar, a fruit which they call <HI>Figo</HI> (<HI>Magellane</HI> cals it a Fig of a &s;pan long, but is no other then that which the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> have named <HI>Plantanes</HI>) <HI>Cocoes</HI> and a kind of meale&punc; which they call <HI>Sago,</HI> made of the tops of certaine trees, ta&s;ting in the mouth like &s;owre curdes, but melts away like Sugar; whereof they make a kinde of cake which will keepe good at lea&s;t ten yeers; of this la&s;t we made the greate&s;t quan|tity of our provi&s;ion: for a few Cloves we did al&s;o traffique, whereof for a &s;mall matter, we might have had grearer &s;tore, then we could well tell where to be&s;tow: but our Generals care vvas that the Ship &s;hould not be too much pe&s;tered or anoyed therewith.</P>

meanes would give con&s;ent, he &s;hould hazard him&s;elfe, e&s;peci|all, for that the Kings Brother had uttered certaine words, in &s;ecret conference with our Generall aboard his Cabbin, which bred no &s;mall &s;u&s;pition of ill intent; our General being thus re|&s;olved not to goe a &s;hoar at that time, re&s;erved the Viceroy for a pledge, and &s;o &s;ent certaine of his Gentlemen to the Court, both to accompany the Kings Brother, and al&s;o with &s;peciall me&s;&s;age to the King him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>They being come &s;omewhat neere unto the Ca&s;tle, were re|ceived by another Brother of the Kings, and certaine others of the greate&s;t States and conducted with great honour towards the Ca&s;tle, where being brought into a large and faire hou&s;e, they &s;aw gathered together a great multitude of people, by &s;uppo&s;ition at lea&s;t a thou&s;and, the chief whereof were placed round about the Hou&s;e, according as it &s;eemed to their degrees and calling, the re&s;t remained without.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was in forme four &s;quare, covered all over with cloth of divers colours, not much unlike our u&s;uall Pentadoes borne upon a frame of Reeds, the &s;ides being open from the ground&s;ell to the covering, and furni&s;hed with &s;eates round a|bout: it &s;eemes it was there Councell&punc;hou&s;e and not common|ly employed to any other u&s;e.</P>

<P>While&s;t our Gentlemen attended in this place the comming of the King, which was about the &s;pace of halfe an hour, they had the better opportunity to ob&s;erve the&s;e things; as al&s;o that before the Kings comming, there were already &s;et three&s;core noble grave and ancient per&s;onages, all of them reported to be of the Kings privy Councell; at the the nether end of the hou&s;e were placed a great company of young men, of comely per&s;o|nage and attire.

ancient comely hoare-headed men, clothed all in red downe to the ground, but attired on their heads not much unlike the <HI>Turks</HI>; the&s;e they called <HI>Romans,</HI> or Strangers, who lay as Lidgi|ers there to keepe continuall traffique with this people: there were al&s;o two <HI>Turks</HI> one <HI>Italian</HI> as Lidgiers; and la&s;t of all one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who being freed by the Kings out of the hands of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> in the recovering of the I&s;land, &s;erved him now in &s;tead of a Souldier.</P>
<P>The King at la&s;t coming from the Ca&s;tle with 8. or 10. more grave Senators following him, had a very rich Canopy (adorned in the midde&s;t with Embo&s;&s;ings of Gold) borne over him, and was guarded with 12. Lances the points turned downward: our men (accompanied with <HI>Moro</HI> the Kings brother) aro&s;e to meet him, and he very graciou&s;ly did welcome and entertain them.</P>
<P>He was for Per&s;on, &s;uch as we have before de&s;cribed him, of low voice, temperate in &s;peech, of Kingly demeanour, and a <HI>Moore</HI> by Nation. His attire was after the fa&s;hion of the re&s;t of his Country, but far more &s;umptuous, as his condition and &s;tate required: from the Wa&s;te to the ground, was all Cloth of Gold, and that very rich; his Legs bare, but on his Feet a paire of Shooes of Cordivant died Red: in the attire of his head, were finely wreathed in divers rings of plated Gold, of an inch, or an inch and halfe in bredth, which made a fair and princely &s;hew, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a crowne in forme; about his necke he had a chaine of perfect Gold, the linkes very great and one fold double; on his left hand was a Diamond, an Emerald, a Ruby; and a Turky, four very fair and perfect jewels; on his right hand in one Ring, a big and perfect Turky, and in another Ring many Diamonds of a &s;maller &s;ize, very artificiall &s;et and couched to|gether.</P>
<P>As thus he &s;ate in his Chaire of State, at his right &s;ide there &s;tood a Page with a very co&s;tly fan (richly embrodered and be|&s;et with Saphires) breating and gathering the aire to refre&s;h the King, the place being very hot, both by rea&s;on of the Sun, and the a&s;&s;embly of &s;o great a multitude.

<P>For being accu&s;ed of a capitall crime whereof (though free) yet he could not evidently make his Innocency appeare, and knowing the peremptory ju&s;tice of <HI>China,</HI> to be irrevocable, if he &s;hould expect the &s;entence of the Judges; he before hand made &s;uite to his King, that it would plea&s;e him to commit his trial to Gods providence and judgement, and to that end to per|mit him to travel, on this condition, that if he brought not home &s;ome worthy Intelligence, &s;uch as his Maje&s;tie had never had before, and were mo&s;t fit to be known, and mo&s;t honourable for <HI>China,</HI> he &s;hould for ever live an Exile, or el&s;e dye for daring to &s;et foot againe in his owne Country: for he was a&s;&s;ured that the God of Heaven had care of Innocency.</P>

<P>Our Generall gave ample &s;atisfaction to each part of his re|que&s;t; the &s;tranger harkned with great attention and delight to his di&s;cour&s;e, and as he naturally excelled i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> memory (be|&s;ides his help of Art to better the &s;ame) &s;o he firmely printed it in his mind, and with great reverence thanked God, who had &s;o unexpectedly brought him, to the notice of &s;uch admirable things.

Our Generall hav|ing &s;eene us all landed in &s;afety, returned to his Fleet, be|queathing us to God, and the good conduct of Mr. <HI>Carli|ell,</HI> our Lievtenant Generall: at which time, being about eight of the clocke, we began to March, and abovt noone|time, or towards one of the clocke we approached the Towne, where the Gentlemen and tho&s;e of the better &s;ort, being &s;ome hundred and fifty brave Hor&s;es, or rather more, began to pre&s;ent them&s;elves; but our &s;mall &s;hot played upon them, which were &s;o &s;u&s;tained with good proportion of Pikes in all parts, as they finding no part of our Troope unprepared to receive them (for you mu&s;t under&s;tand they viewed all round about) they were thus driven to give us leave to proceed towards the two Gates of the Towne, which were the next to the Sea-ward. They had manned them both, and planted their Ordnance for that pre&s;ent, and &s;udden alarum without the Gate, and al&s;o &s;ome Troops of &s;mall &s;hot in Ambu&s;cado upon the hye-way &s;ide. We divided our whole Force, being &s;ome thou&s;and or twelve hundred Men into two parts, to en|terprize both the Gates at one in&s;tant; the Lievtenant Generall having openly vowed to Captaine <HI>Powell</HI> (who led the Troope that entered the other Gate) that with Gods good favour he would not re&s;t untill our meeting in the Market-place.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="113">Their Ordnance had no &s;ooner di&s;charged upon our neere approach, and made &s;ome execution among&s;t us, though not much, but the Lievtenant Generall began forthwith to advance both his voyce of encouragement and pace of Marching; the fir&s;t Man that was &s;laine with the Ordnance, being very neer unto him&s;elfe, and there|upon ha&s;ted all that he might to keepe them from re|charging of the Ordinance. And notwith&s;tanding their Ambu&s;cadoes, we marched or rather ran &s;o roundly into them as pell mell we entered the Gates, and gave them more care every Man to &s;ave him&s;elfe by flight, then rea|&s;on to &s;tand any longer to their broken fight; we forth|with repaired to the Market-place: but to be more truly under&s;tood, a place of very faire &s;pacious &s;quare ground before the great Church; whether al&s;o came (as had been agreed) Captaine <HI>Powell</HI> with the other Troope; which place with &s;ome part next unto it, we &s;trengthened with Barricadoes, and there (as the mo&s;t convenient place) a&s;|&s;ured our &s;elves, the City being farre too &s;pacious for &s;o &s;mall and weary a Troope to undertake to guard.

<P>The next day we quartered a little more at large, but not into the halfe part of the Town, and &s;o making &s;ub|&s;tantiall trenches, and planting all the Ordnance that each part was corre&s;pondent to other: we held this Town the &s;pace of one Moneth.</P>

<P>From S. <HI>Domingo</HI> we put over to the maine or firme Land, and going all along&s;t the Coa&s;t, we came at the la&s;t in &s;ight of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> &s;tanding upon the Sea &s;ide &s;o near as &s;ome of our Barks in pa&s;&s;ing along&s;t, approched vvith the reach of their Culverin &s;hot, which they had planted upon certaine Platformes.

<P>At this in&s;tant we might hear &s;ome Peeces of Artille|ry di&s;charged, with diver&s;e &s;mall &s;hot towards the Har|bour, which gave us to under&s;tand, according to the Or|der &s;et downe in the evening before by our Generall, that the Vice-Admirall accompanied with Captaine <HI>Venner,</HI> Captaine <HI>White,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> with other Sea Captaines, and with diver&s;e Pinnaces and Boates &s;hould give &s;ome attempt unto the little Fort &s;tanding on the en|try of the inner Haven, neer adjoyning to the town, though to &s;mall purpo&s;e, for that the place was &s;trong, and the entry very narrow vvas chained over: &s;o as there could be nothing gotten by the attempt, more then the giving of them an Alarum on that other &s;ide of the Haven being a mile and a halfe from the place where we now vvere.

<P>The Troops being now in their March, halfe a mile be hither the towne or le&s;&s;e, the ground we were on grew to be &s;traight, and not above fifty paces over, having the maine Sea on the &s;ide of it, and the Harbour vvater or in|ner Sea (as you may terme it) on the other &s;ide, which in this Plot is plainly &s;hewed. This &s;traight was fortified clean over with a &s;tone Wall and a ditch without it; the &s;aid Wall being as orderly built with flancking in every part, as can be &s;et down. There was onely &s;o much of this &s;traight unwalled, as might &s;erve for the i&s;&s;uing of the Hor&s;emen, or the pa&s;&s;ing of the carriage in time of need: but this anwalled part was not without a very good <HI>Barri|cado</HI> of Wine Buts or Pipes, filled vvith earth, full and thicke as they might &s;tand on end one by another, &s;ome part of them &s;tanding even within the maine Sea.</P>
<P>This place of &s;trength was furni&s;hed of &s;ix great Pee|ces, demi-Culverins and Sakers, which &s;hot directly in front upon us as we approached. Now without this vvall upon the inner &s;ide of the &s;treight, they had brought like|vvi&s;e two great Gallies with their prowe&s;&s;e to the &s;hore, having planted in them eleven peeces of Ordnance, vvhich did beat all cro&s;&s;e the &s;traight, and flanked our comming on.

Our Lievtenant generall commanded our &s;hot to forbear &s;hooting untill we were come to the wall &s;ide; and &s;o with Pikes roundly together we approached the place, where we &s;oone found out the Barricadoes of Pipes or Buts, to be the meete&s;t place for our a&s;&s;ault; which notwith&s;tanding it was well furni&s;hed with Pikes and &s;hot, was without &s;taying attempted by us: downe went the buts of earth, and pell mell came our Swords and Pikes together, after our &s;hot had fir&s;t given their volley, even at the enemies no&s;e. Our Pikes were &s;ome|what longer then theirs, and our bodies better armed, for very few of them were armed; with which advantage our Swords and Pikes grew too hard for them, and they dri|ven to give place. In this furious entry, the Lievtenant generall &s;lue with his owne hands, the chiefe En&s;igne-bea|rer of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> vvho fought very manfully to his lives end.</P>

<P>At every Streets-end they had rai&s;ed very fine Barri|cadoes of Earth-vvorkes, vvith trenches vvithout them, as vvell made as ever vve &s;avv any vvorke done; at the en|tring whereof was &s;ome little re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;oone over|come; it was with few &s;laine or hurt.

<P>The warning which this Towne received of our com|ming towards them, from S. <HI>Domingo,</HI> by the &s;pace of twenty dayes before our arrivall hither, was cau&s;e that they had both fortified and every way prepared for their be&s;t defence. As al&s;o that they had carried and convayed away all their Trea&s;ure and principall &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Ran&s;ome of one hundred and ten thou&s;and Duck|ets thus concluded on, as is afore&s;aid, the &s;ame being writ|ten, and expre&s;&s;ing for nothing more then the Towne of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> upon the paiment of the &s;aid Ran&s;ome, we left the &s;aid Towne, and drew &s;ome part of our Souldi|ers into the Priory or Abbey, &s;tanding a quarter of one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile below the Towne upon the Harbour water
<PB N="32" REF="119">
&s;ide, the &s;ame being walled with a wall of &s;tone, which we told the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was yet ours, and not redeemed by their Compo&s;ition: whereupon they finding the defect of their Contract, were contented to enter into another Ran&s;ome for all places, but &s;pecially for the &s;aid Hou&s;e, as al&s;o the Blocke-hou&s;e or Ca&s;tle, which is upon the mouth of the inner Harbour. And when we asked as much for the one as for the other, they yeelded to give one thou|&s;and Crownes for the Abbey, leaving us to take our plea|&s;ure upon the Block-hou&s;e, which they &s;aid they were not able to ran&s;ome, having &s;tretched them&s;elves to the utter|mo&s;t of their powers; and therefore the &s;aid Block-hou&s;e was by us undermined, and &s;o wirh Gun-powder blowne up in peeces.</P>
<P>While this latter Contract was in making, our whole Fleet of Ships fell downe towards the Harbour mouth, where they Anchored the third time, and employed their Men in fetching of fre&s;h Water aboord the Ships, for our Voyage homewards, which Water was had in a great Well, that is in the I&s;land by the Harbour mouth; which I&s;land is a very plea&s;ant place as hath been &s;een, having in it many &s;orts of goodly and very plea&s;ant Fruits, as the Orange trees and others, being &s;et orderly in Walkes of great length together. In&s;omuch as the whole I&s;land be|ing &s;ome two or three miles about, is ca&s;t into grounds of Gardening and Orchards.</P>
<P>After &s;ix weekes abode in this place, we put to Sea the la&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> where after two or three dayes, a great Ship which we had taken at S: <HI>Domingo,</HI> and thereup|on was called <HI>The new years gift,</HI> fell into a great leake, being laden with Ordnance, Hides, and other Spoyles, in the night &s;he lo&s;t the company of our Fleet; which be|ing mi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the next morning by the Generall, he ca&s;t a|bout
<PB N="33" REF="119">
with the whole Fleet, fearing &s;ome great mi&s;chance to be happened unto her, as in very deed it &s;o fell out; for her leake was &s;o great, and her Men were all tyred with Pumping. But at the la&s;t having found her, and the Barke <HI>Talbot</HI> in her company, which &s;tayed by great hap with her, was ready to take their Men out of her, for the &s;aving of them. And &s;o the Generall being fully adverti|&s;ed of their great extremity, made &s;aile directly backe a|gaine to <HI>Cartagena</HI> with the whole Fleet, where having &s;tayed eight or ten dayes more, about the unlading of this Ship, and the be&s;towing thereof and her Men, into other Ships; we departed once againe to Sea, directing our cour&s;e towards the Cape S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> being the Ea&s;ter|mo&s;t part of <HI>Cuba,</HI> whether we arrived the &s;even &amp; twen|tieth of <HI>Apil.</HI> But becau&s;e fre&s;h water could not pre|&s;ently be found, we weyed ankor and departed, thinking in few dayes to recover the <HI>Mattances,</HI> a place to the Ea&s;t-ward of <HI>Havana.</HI></P>
<P>After we had &s;ailed &s;ome fourteene dayes, we were brought to Cape S. <HI>Anthony</HI> againe, thorough lacke of favourable winde: but then our &s;car&s;ity was grown &s;uch, as need made us looke a little better for water, which we found in &s;ufficient quantity, being indeede, as I judge, none other then raine water newly fallen, and gathered up by making pits in a plot of marri&s;h ground, &s;ome three hun|dred pa&s;es from the Sea &s;ide.</P>
<P>I doe wrong if I &s;hould forget the good example of the Generall at this place, who to encourage others, and to ha&s;ten the getting of fre&s;h water aboord the Ships, tooke no le&s;&s;e paine him&s;elfe then the meane&s;t, as al&s;o at S. <HI>Do|mingo, Cartagena,</HI> and all other places, having alwayes &s;o vigilant a care and fore&s;ight in the good ordering of his Fleet, accompanying them, as it is &s;aid, with &s;uch won|derfull
<PB N="34" REF="120">
travell of body, as doubtle&s;&s;e had he beene the meane&s;t per&s;on, as he was the chiefe&s;t, he had yet de&s;er|ved the fir&s;t place of honour: and no le&s;&s;e happy doe we accompt him, for being a&s;&s;ociated with Ma&s;ter <HI>Carleill</HI> his Lievtenant Generall, by who&s;e experience, prudent coun&s;ell, and gallant performance, he atchieved &s;o many and happy enterpri&s;es of the War, by whom al&s;o he was very greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in &s;etting downe the needfull Or|ders, Lawes, and cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice and for the due admi|ni&s;tration of the &s;ame upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>After three dayes &s;pent in watering our Ships, we de|parted now the &s;econd time from this Cape of S. <HI>An|thony</HI> the thirteenth of <HI>May,</HI> and proceeding about the Cape of <HI>Florida,</HI> we never touched any where, but coa&s;ting along&s;t <HI>Florida,</HI> and keeping the &s;hore &s;till in &s;ight, the eight and twentieth of <HI>May</HI> early in the morning, we de&s;cried on the &s;hore a place built like a Beacon, which was indeed a Scaffold upon foure long Ma&s;tes, rai&s;ed on end for men ro di&s;cover to the Seaward, being in the latitude of thirty degrees, or very neare thereunto. Our Pinnaces manned, and comming to the &s;hore, we marehed up along&s;t the River &s;ide, to &s;ee what place the Enemie held there: for none among&s;t us had any knowledge thereof at all.</P>
<P>Here the Generall tooke occa&s;ion to march with the companies him&s;elfe in Per&s;on, the Lieutenant Generall having the Vantguard, and going a mile up or &s;omewhat more by the River &s;ide, we might di&s;cerne on the other &s;ide of the River over again&s;t us, a fort, which newly had been built by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and &s;ome mile or three about above the fort, was a little Town or village without wals, built of woodden hou&s;es, as this Plot here doth plainly &s;hew: we forthwith prepared to have Ordnance for the
<PB N="35" REF="120">
battery, and one Peece was a little before the evening planted, and the fir&s;t &s;hot being made by the Lievtenant Generall him&s;elfe at their En&s;igne, &s;trake through the En&s;igne, as we afterwards under&s;tood by a <HI>Fenchman,</HI> which came unto us from them. One &s;hot more was then made, which &s;trake the foot of the fort Wall, which was all ma&s;&s;ive timber of great trees like Ma&s;tes. The Lievtenant Generall was determined to pa&s;&s;e the River this night with foure Companies, and there to lodge him&s;elfe intrenched as neare the Fort, as that he might play with his Muskets and &s;malle&s;t &s;hot upon any that &s;hould appeare; and &s;o afterward to bring and plant the battery with him, but the helpe of the Marriners for that &s;udden to make Trenches could not be had, which was the cau&s;e that this determination was remitted untill the next night.</P>
<P>In the night the Lievtenant General tooke a little row|ing Skiffe, and halfe a dozen well armed, as Captaine <HI>Morgan,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> with &s;ome others be|&s;ides the rowers, and went to view what gard the Enemy kept, as al&s;o to take knowledge of the ground. And albeit he went as covertly as might be, yet the Enemy taking the <HI>Alarum,</HI> grew fearfull that the whole Force was ap|proaching to the a&s;&s;ault, and therefore with all &s;peed abandoned the place after the &s;hooting of &s;ome of their Peeces. They thus gone, and he being returned unto us againe, but nothing knowing of their flight from their Fort, forthwith came a <HI>Frenchman</HI> being a Phipher (who had been pri&s;oner with them) in a little Boat, playing on his Phiph the tune of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his &s;ong, and being called unto by the Guard, he told them be|fore he put foot out of the Boat, what he was him&s;elfe, and how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were gone from the Fort,
<PB N="36" REF="121">
offering either to remaine in hands there, or el&s;e to return to the place with them that would goe.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, the Generall, the Lievtenant Generall, with &s;ome of the Captaines in one Shiffe, and the Vice-Admiral with &s;ome others in his Skiffe, and two or three Pinnaces furni&s;hed of Souldiers with them, put pre&s;ently over towards the Fort, giving order for the re&s;t of the Pinnaces to follow. And in our approach, &s;ome of the Enemy bolder then the re&s;t, having &s;tayed behinde their company, &s;hot off two peeces of Ordnance at us; but on &s;hore we went, and entred the place without finding any man there.</P>
<P>When the day appeared, we found it built all of Tim|ber, the Wals being none other but whole Ma&s;ts or bodies of Trees &s;et upright and clo&s;e together, in man|ner of a Pale, without any Ditch as yet made, but who intended with &s;ome more time, for they had not as yet fini&s;hed all their work, having begun the &s;ame &s;ome three or foure Moneths before: &s;o as to &s;ay the truth, they had no rea&s;on to keepe it, being &s;ubject both to fire and ea&s;ie a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The platforme whereon the Ordnance lay, was whole bodies of long Pine trees, whereof there is great plenty, layed a cro&s;&s;e one on another, and &s;ome little earth a|mong&s;t. There was in it thirteen or fourteen great peeces of bra&s;&s;e Ordnance, and a Che&s;t unbroken up, having in it the value of &s;ome two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, by e&s;ti|mation of the Kings trea&s;ure, to pay the Souldiers of that place, who were one hundred and fifty Men.</P>
<P>The Fort thus won, which they called S. <HI>John</HI> Fort, and the day opened, we a&s;&s;ayed to goe to the Towne, but could not by rea&s;on of &s;ome Rivers and broken ground which was betweene the two places; and therefore en|forced
<PB N="37" REF="121">
to imbarke againe into our Pinnaces, we went thi|ther upon the great maine River, which is called, as al&s;o the Towne by the name of S. <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>At our approaching to land, there was &s;ome that began to &s;hew them&s;elves, &amp; to be&s;tow &s;ome few &s;hot upon us, but pre&s;ently withdrew them&s;elves. And in their runing thus away, the Serjeant Major finding one of their Hor&s;es ready &s;adled &amp; bridled, took the &s;ame to follow the cha&s;e, and &s;o overgoing all his Company, was (by one layed be|hinde a Bu&s;h) &s;hot through the head, and falling downe therewith, was by the &s;ame and two or three more, &s;tab|bed in three or foure places of his body with Swords and Daggers, before any could come neere to his reskue. His death was much lamented, being in very deed an hone&s;t wi&s;e Gentleman, and a Souldier of good experience, and of as great courage as any man might be.</P>
<P>In this place called S. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> we under&s;tood the King did keepe, as is before &s;aid, one hundred and fifty Souldiers, and at another place &s;ome dozen leagus beyond to the Northwards, called S. <HI>Helena,</HI> he did there likewi&s;e keepe one hundred and fifty more, &s;erving there for no o|ther purpo&s;e, then to keepe all other Nations from Inha|biting any part of all that Coa&s;t, the Government wherof vvas committed to one <HI>Pedro Melendez Marque&s;&s;e,</HI> Ne|phew to that <HI>Melendez</HI> the Admitall, vvho had over|thrown Ma&s;ter <HI>John Hawkins</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Mexico</HI> &s;ome fifteen or &s;ixteen years agoe. This Governor had charge of both places, but vvas at this time in this place, and one of the fir&s;t that left the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Here it vvas re&s;olved in full a&s;&s;embly of Captaines, to undertake the enterprize of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> and from thence to &s;eek out the Inhabitation of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Country-Men
<PB N="38" REF="122">
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> di&s;tant from thence &s;ome &s;ix degrees North|ward.</P>
<P>When we came thwart of Saint <HI>Helena</HI> the &s;hols ap|pearing dangerous, and we having no Pilot to undertake the entrie, it was thought meere&s;t to goe hence along&s;t. For the Admiral had been the &s;ame night in four fadome and a halfe three leagues from the &s;hore: and yet we un|der&s;tood by the help of a known Pilot, there may and doth goe in Ships of greater burthen and draught then any we had in our Fleet.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed thus along&s;t the Coa&s;t hard aboord the &s;hore, which is &s;hallow for a league or two from the &s;hore, and the &s;ame is low and broken land for the mo&s;t part.</P>
<P>The ninth of <HI>June</HI> upon fight of one &s;peciall great fire (which are very ordinary all along&s;t this coa&s;t, even from the Cape of <HI>Florida</HI> hither) the Generall &s;ent his Skiffe to the &s;hore, where they found &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Country men (that had been &s;ent thither the year before by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>) and brought one aboord, by who&s;e direction we proceeded along to the place which they make their Port. But &s;ome of our Shipps being of great draught unable to enter, we anchored all without the Harbour in a wilde Road at Sea, about two miles from &s;hore.</P>
<P>From whence the Generall wrote Letters to Ma&s;ter <HI>Ralph Lane,</HI> being Governour of tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>&V;irgi|nia,</HI> and then at his Fort about &s;ix leagues from the Road in an I&s;land which they call <HI>Roanoac,</HI> wherein is &s;pecial|ly he &s;hewed how ready he was to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities and wants which he under&s;tood of, by tho&s;e he had fir&s;t talked withall.</P>
<P>The morrow after Ma&s;ter <HI>Lane</HI> him&s;elfe and &s;ome of
<PB N="39" REF="122">
his company comming unto him, with the con&s;ent of his Captaines he gave them the choice of two offers, that is to &s;ay: either he would leave a Ship, a Pinnace, and cer|taine Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es with &s;ufficient Ma&s;ters and Marriners, toge|ther furni&s;hed with a Moneths Victuall to &s;tay and make farther di&s;covery of the Country and coa&s;ts, and &s;o much Victual likewi&s;e that might be &s;ufficient for the bringing of them all (being an hundred and three Per&s;ons) into <HI>England</HI> if they thought good after &s;uch time, with any other thing they would de&s;ire, and that he might be able to &s;pare.</P>
<P>Or el&s;e if they thought they had made &s;ufficient di&s;co|very already, and did de&s;ire to returne into <HI>England,</HI> he would give them pa&s;&s;age. But they as it &s;eemed, being de&s;irous to &s;tay, accepted very thankfully, and with great gladne&s;&s;e that which was offred fir&s;t. Whereupon the Ship being appointed and received into charge, by &s;ome of their owne Company &s;ent into her by Ma&s;ter <HI>Lane,</HI> before they had received from the re&s;t of the Fleet, the Provi&s;ion appointed them, there aro&s;e a great &s;torme (which they &s;aid was extraordinary and very &s;trange) that la&s;ted three dayes together, and put all our Fleet in great danger to be driven from their ankoring upon the coa&s;t. For we brake many Cables, and lo&s;t many Ankors. And &s;ome of our Fleet which had lo&s;t all of which num|ber was the &s;hip appointed for Ma&s;ter <HI>Lane</HI> and his com|pany) was driven to put to Sea in great danger, in avoy|ding the Coa&s;t, and could never &s;ee us againe untill we met in <HI>England.</HI> Many al&s;o of our &s;mall Pinnaces and Boats were lo&s;t in this &s;torme.</P>
<P>Notwit&s;tanding after all this, the Generall offered them (with con&s;ent of his Captaines) another Ship with &s;ome Provi&s;ion, although not &s;uch a one for their turnes,
<PB N="40" REF="123">
as might have been &s;pared them before, this being unable to be brought into their Harbour. Or el&s;e if they would, to give them pa&s;&s;age into <HI>England,</HI> although he knew he &s;hould performe it with greater difficulty then he might have done before.</P>
<P>But Ma&s;ter <HI>Lane</HI> with tho&s;e of the chiefe&s;t of his com|pany he had then with him, con&s;idering what &s;hould be be&s;t for them to doe, made reque&s;t unto the Generall un|der their hands, that they might have pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Eng|land</HI>: the which being granted, and the re&s;t &s;ent for out of the Country and &s;hipped, we departed from that coa&s;t the eighteenth of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;o God be thanked, both they and we in good &s;af|ty arrived at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 28. 1586. to the great glory of God, and to no &s;mall honour to our Prince, our Countrey and our &s;elves.</P>
<P>The totall value of that which was gotten in this Voy|age, is e&s;timated at three&s;core thou&s;and pounds, whereof the Companies which have travelled in the Voyage were to have twenty thou&s;and pounds, the Adventurers the o|ther forthy. Of which twenty thou&s;and pounds (as I can judge) will redound &s;ome &s;ix pounds to the &s;ingle &s;hare.</P>
