<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>_FOr&s;omuch, the truth of hi&s;torie, is
the foundation of faith, and of &s;pi|rituall
vnder&s;tanding, (Chri&s;tian
Reader,) and the hi&s;tory of things
donne, blinde and imperfect, with|out
the knowledge of places, the
which knowledge giueth muche
light, both to the truth of hi&s;tory, and al&s;o to the &s;piritu|all
interpretation thereof: therefore I haue thought good
to ob&s;erue two things with great diligence in this worke.
Fir&s;t that I might portray and &s;et forth the true and liue|ly
Image of <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> of all other citties the mo&s;t glori|us
and famous throughout the whole world, whereof men|tion
is made in &s;acred and in prophane hi&s;tories, as it flori|&s;hed
in Chri&s;t his time; and al&s;o the forme of the temple,
(the fame whereof hath beene extolled aboue the heauens,
and was worthy of eternall memory) by the &s;acred Scrip|tures,
by approued writers, and by auncient tradition of
faithfull and tru&s;ty men, in a liuely plot, or map, mo&s;t e|qui&s;itly
drawn, together with the names, originalls, &s;itu|ations,
and formes of euery place, and the mo&s;t worthy hi|&s;tories
concerning the &s;ame, with all breuity. Secondly,
that I might rightly di&s;po&s;e the places of Chri&s;t his pas&s;i|on,
and repre&s;ent euery thing which he &s;uffered in euery
place, euen as if they were now donne before our eies: and
&s;o repre&s;ented that I might, explaine it with plainene&s;&s;e
and breuity. For hereby, all tho&s;e thinges which he &s;uf|fered
for our &s;akes, wilbe both more plainely vnder&s;tood,
and al&s;o more profitably remembred. But per aduenture
there wilbe &s;ome which will mi&s;like this our endeuour,
and the rather bicau&s;e we haue many thinges by tradition
of elders: to whom I an&s;were out of Saint <HI>Hierom</HI> where
<PB REF="5">
he &s;aith, <HI>That eccle&s;ia&s;ticall traditions, which are no
hinderance to faith, are &s;o to be kept, as they were de|liuered
by the auncients.</HI> In the meane time I will not
&s;ay, that they are too ra&s;h &amp; too too wicked, which wil de|ny
that thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. to. 1.</NOTE> which hath beene godly receiued at al times
and of all men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t. 28. ad Lucinium.</NOTE> So many of vs therefore as wa&s;hed with
the bloud of Chri&s;t, do beare his name and are called Chri|&s;tians,
if our faith be aun&s;wering to our name, and our life
not di&s;agreeing from the truth, hoping to be &s;aued by the
merits &amp; grace of Chri&s;t our &s;auiour, let vs beleeue that,
which incorrupt and reuerend antiquity hath left, let vs
in no wi&s;e depart from tho&s;e thinges which our aunce&s;tors
haue celebrated without &s;uper&s;tition, and which by the
con&s;ent of the whole worlde, are come euen from them to
our hands, and with thankful godlines, and godly thankful|ne&s;&s;e,
let vs call to minde tho&s;e places oftentimes, which
may put vs in rememberance of the pas&s;ion of Chri&s;te: to
which places this mappe will leade vs, as it were by the
hande: and with the eies of faith and of our minde let vs
looke vpon the &s;ame &s;onne of God, and inwardly behoulde
him, who being vrged with the great loue of our &s;aluati|on,
hauing fini&s;hed his la&s;te &s;upper in the parlour of Sion
and being come into the Garden of Oliuet, prayed and
&s;wet bloud, through the angui&s;h and greuous con&s;iderati|on
of the Imminent afflictions. Immediately hee was be|trayed
by the mo&s;t wicked Iudas; he was taken, bounde,
and thru&s;t forward by the Iewes, euen as a lambe by the
woolues, mo&s;t cruelly amid&s;t the noi&s;e of clamors and wea|pons,
and then was ledde to the hou&s;e of <HI>Anna</HI> the high
prie&s;t: There hee was &s;tricken: From thence hee was
drawne to the pallace of <HI>Caiphas:</HI> in the &s;ame, hee was
fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, condemned, &s;pyt vpon, blindfolded, buffe|ted
with fi&s;tes, and &s;undry waies all the night &s;corned and
afflicted. In the morning he was violently caried through
the mid&s;t of the cittie to the hou&s;e of <HI>Pilate.</HI> From thence
<PB REF="5">
he was led to the pallace of <HI>Herod</HI> and accufed againe, de|&s;pi&s;ed
of him, mocked, &amp; apparrelled like a foole in a white
garment, &amp; brought back again by another way of the city
to <HI>Pilate.</HI> There again he was accu&s;ed of many faultes, &s;trip+ped,
and greuou&s;ly whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned
with thornes, dyuer&s;ly derided, &s;pitted vppon, buffetted
with fi&s;tes and &s;tricken with a reede&punc; and being thus mi&s;|u&s;ed,
was made a gazeing &s;tocke to the people and adiud|ged
to death. Then he was loden with a heauie cro&s;&s;e, and
in the &s;ight of all the people, with greeuous and bloudy &s;teps
hee was drawen, punched: and vrged by the furiou&s;e vi|olence
of the &s;oldiers, through a great parte of the cittie,
and by the gate of Iudgement out of the cittie, by a harde
and &s;toany way, euen vnto mount, <HI>Caluarie.</HI> And being
come thither he was &s;tripped againe, and being both faint
and weary, was refre&s;hed with gaule in &s;tede of drink: and
about high noone he was fa&s;tened to the cro&s;se, &amp; &s;o lifted
vpon high. And hanging on the cro&s;&s;e by the &s;pace of three
howers, was derided with taunts &amp; reproachfull woordes:
being thir&s;tie, they gaue him vineger to drinke. Finally
he which could &s;aue the world with one drop of his bloude
would needes be&s;towe vppon vs by the fiue Riuers of his
woundes, his life, with all his bloude. A figure hereof
was that bra&s;en &s;erpent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 3.</NOTE> which mo&s;es cau&s;ed to be exalted
in the wildernes. To this &s;pectacle al&s;o our heauenly fa|ther
calleth euery faithfull &s;oule, <HI>Come forth</HI> (&s;aith he)
<HI>ye daughters of Sion, and &s;ee king Salomon,</HI> Naye one
farre greater then <HI>Salomon.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lament. of Ieremy 3.</NOTE> In like manner Chri&s;t han|ging
on the cro&s;se crieth out <HI>O all ye which pa&s;&s;e by the
way, behould and &s;ee, if there be any &s;orrow &amp; greefe
like myne.</HI></P>
<P>And not onely to the con&s;ideration and meditation of
the&s;e things, but al&s;o to the Imitation, God in the holy
Scripture exhorteth vs in the&s;e woordes (&s;piritually in|terpreted)
&s;aying, <HI>Looke, &amp; make all thinges according
<PB REF="6">
to the example or fa&s;hion which was &s;hewed thee in
the mount.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 25.</NOTE> For all the precepts of life, which our &s;auiour
taught all the time of his preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 8.</NOTE> as well by word as by
example, the &s;ame he expre&s;&s;ed in him&s;elfe in one day of
his pas&s;ion: Wherefore if we would follow Chri&s;t, not onely
in woorde but al&s;o in woorke, we may, by his liuely crucifi|ed
Image on mount Caluarie, as it were out of a goulden
booke intituled with the noble title of three mo&s;t principal
languages, written with the quils of the &s;peare, of the nails
of the thornes, and of the whippes, in the mo&s;t pure parch|ment
of the Immaculat lambe, and with the purple bloude
of the &s;ame, both learned and vnlearned, learne ea&s;ely &amp;
breifly, perfect theologie, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome remedies of
Phi&s;icke, the full knowledge of Lawe and of Iu&s;tice, the
&s;cience of liberall artes, of true humilitie, of obedience, of
pietie, of charitie, of patience, finally of all manner of ver|tues,
and of thinges mo&s;t perfect: and may al&s;o bee inflamed
and drawen to loue and to follow Chri&s;t. Thus the ble&s;&s;ed
virgin, &s;tanding nere to the cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t, did not onely
with bodely eies, but al&s;o in hart, through faith (which wa|uered
not in her) behould the woundes of her &s;onne and &s;e|riou&s;ly
thinking thereon, was &s;o comforted, that now, as
<HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> &s;aith &s;he was prepared al&s;o to die for the good
of mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambro&s;e in Luc. ca. 23.</NOTE> So &s;aint Ihon both &s;eing the &s;ide of Christ o|pened
with a &s;peare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 19.</NOTE> bloude with water comming foorth of
the &s;ame, and al&s;o giuing te&s;timonie thereunto, did by the
meditation thereof &s;o greatly profite, that at the la&s;t he be|came
a mo&s;t perfect diuine, and a &s;oaring Eagle to behoulde
the mo&s;t holy Trinitie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23, Hier. to. 1.</NOTE> So the Theefe, when he &s;awe and
hearde Chri&s;t Ie&s;us crucified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t. 13. ad Pauli|num.</NOTE> in continently tourned vnto
Chri&s;t, and confes&s;ing him, he made the puni&s;hment of mur+der
martiredome, and chaunged the cro&s;&s;e for Paradice.
So al&s;o the <HI>Centurion</HI> by this &s;pectacle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 15.</NOTE> receaued &s;o great
&s;trength of faith, that vnder the cro&s;se he was made a fa|mous
<PB REF="6">
confe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;t, and further (as <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI>
&s;aith) was afterwarde crowned with <HI>Martyredome.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri&s;o&s;t. in Mat. ca. 27.</NOTE>
Moreouer <HI>Thomas</HI> behoulding &amp; touching the wounds
of Chri&s;t crucified, was &s;o illumined with faith, that hee
plainly and openly profe&s;sed Chri&s;t, to be both his Lord and
his God.</P>
<P>This beeing &s;o, and loue procuring loue, euen as the
load&s;tone draweth Ironne: who is hee, I pray you, whome
&s;o vehement loue of Chri&s;t, nay rather a heate and flame
will not affecte, kindell, and &s;ette on fier? Who is he when
at the death of Chri&s;t all creatures do &s;uffer with him, the
Sunne darkened, the vaile of the Temple rent in &s;onder,
the earth quaking, Rockes breaking, graues opening, and
the deade ari&s;ing, who and what is hee (I &s;ay) that will
not woonder, and that will not be abas&s;hed? Onely Adams
children, for who&s;e cau&s;e he died are not moued with this
&s;o great a benefite.</P>
<P>The Adamente, that mo&s;t harde &s;toane, is mollified
with the bloude of a goate: Iron with the heate of fier is
made &s;ofte:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 10.</NOTE> but the hartes of Chri&s;tians more harde then
Adamant or Iron, are not mollified with the bloude and
fier of Chri&s;t&punc; but do crucifie a fre&s;h vnto them&s;elues the
&s;onne of God, and do tread vnder their feete the bloude of
the te&s;tament.</P>
<P>What I pray you can be more be&s;eeming, more meete,
more Iu&s;te, and more profitable for vs, then to loue againe
him that &s;o loueth vs, and Imitate him whome wee loue?
For if any thing herein &s;eme harde, if any thing greuous,
that thing, loue, the &s;weete yoke of the Lord, maketh light
and ea&s;ie, for all labor is light, to him that loueth, accor|ding
to that notable &s;entence of that auntiente father
&s;aint <HI>Gregory, Nihil adeo graue e&s;t quod non aequani|miter
toleretur, &s;i Chr&s;ti pas&s;io, ad memoriam reduca
tur.</HI> There is nothing &s;o heauy &amp; burthen&s;ome but the &s;ame
<PB REF="7">
is willingly borne, if &s;o be the pas&s;ion of Chri&s;t be remem|bered.</P>
<P>For we will indure all thinges with patience as light
and ea&s;ie, if we call to mynde what hard wordes, harder
&s;tripes, and mo&s;t harde paines and afflictions, he &s;uffered
for vs, who&s;e heade was crowned with thornes, his eyes
blinde foulded, his eares filled with reproaches, his mouth
with gaule and vineger, his face polluted with &s;pitting,
his cheekes bru&s;ed with buffetting, his knee&s;e &s;haking, his
&s;houlders laden with the cro&s;&s;e, his hart repleni&s;hed with
&s;orrow his bodie torne with whippes, his members racked,
his handes and feete bored,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15.</NOTE> to be breefe from the crowne of
the heade to the &s;oales of the foot, he &s;u&s;tained an Innume|rable
&s;ort of woundes and &s;orrowes. Wherefore as the wa|ters
<HI>Mara,</HI> being &s;ometimes bitter, were made &s;wete by
<HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> at what time he ca&s;t wood into them: euen &s;o all
our tribulation, if we patiently indure the cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t,
will waxe &s;weete, and the gaule thereof will: tourne into
honny. For by the meditations of the&s;e afflictions of our &s;a|uiour,
faith is illumined, hope &s;trengthened, charitie infla|med,
and all vertue increa&s;ed. Wherefore &s;aint Augu&s;tine
a light of the Church, no le&s;&s;e truly then godly, prouoking
vs by very forceable woordes therevnto: &s;aith thus, <HI>Be|hould
the woundes of him that hangeth, the bloud of
him that dieth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t. in lib de virgi nitate.</NOTE> <HI>the price of the redemer, the &s;carres of
him that ry&s;eth: His heade boweth to ki&s;&s;e thee, his
hart is opened to loue thee, his armes &s;tretched abroad
to imbrace thee, his whole bodie &s;et forth to redeeme
thee. Con&s;ider what and how greate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="broken" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e thinges be,
waigh them in the ballance of your heartes, that hee
may be wholy fa&s;tened in your hartes, who for vs was
wholy fa&s;tened on the cro&s;&s;e.</HI> Thus far <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI> So
that it is not enough to meditate of the&s;e thinges once: but
it is profitable to thinke vpon them often: yea the oftener,
the more they auaile and profite. In the whole&s;ome con|templation
<PB REF="7">
of who&s;e pas&s;ion, although we profite much, yet
we &s;hall neuer attaine to the perfite knowledge thereof,
but there will remaine &s;till &s;omewhat that we may &s;eeke
for, the full knowledge wherof is re&s;erued to our heauenly
countrey. In the meane tyme, let vs contemplate in the&s;e
thinges day and night, in the&s;e things let vs recreate and
bu&s;ie our &s;elues. In the&s;e let vs watch, in the&s;e let vs &s;leep,
yea to die in the meditation of the&s;e things, is mo&s;t Chri&s;ti|an,
