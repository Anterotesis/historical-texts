<P>_AFTER Sixteen days of fair wea|ther, and&punc; pro&s;perous windes, <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 26 in&s;tant, four of the clock in the Afternoon, God be thanked, we e&s;pied Land on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Florida,</HI> in the lat. of 32 deg. 30 min. being four Leagues or thereabouts to the Northwards of Saint <HI>Ellens,</HI> having run five hundred and fifty Leagues;
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and to the We&s;tward of the Meridian of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> three hundred thirty and one Leagues. This Evening and the Night following we lay off and on: <HI>Thur&s;|day</HI> the 27th in&s;tant, in the morning, we &s;tood in with the Land, and coa&s;ted the Shoar to the South|ward, Ankering at Nights, and &s;ending our Boat out a Mornings, till we came into the lat. of 31 deg. but found no good harbour that way. On <HI>Sun|day</HI> the 30th in&s;tant, we tacked, and &s;tood North|ward: and on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> we came to an Anchor in five fathoms at the mouth of a very large opening of three Leagues wide, or therea|bouts, in the lat. of 32 deg. 30 min. and &s;ent our Boat to &s;ound the Channel. On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the third, we entered the Harbour, and found that it was the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> and was but four Leagues or therea|bouts N. E. from <HI>Port Royal,</HI> which by the <HI>Spanyards</HI> is called St. <HI>Ellens:</HI> within Land, both Rivers meet in one. We &s;pent &s;ome time to &s;ound the Chanels both without and within, and to &s;earch the Rivers in &s;everal branches, and to view the Land. On <HI>Saturday</HI> the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> two <HI>Indians</HI> came on Board us from the N. E. &s;hoar, whom we entertain|ed courteou&s;ly, and afterwards &s;et them on &s;hoar. On <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;ixth, &s;everal <HI>Indians</HI> came on Board us, and &s;aid they were of St. <HI>Ellens;</HI> being very bold and familiar; &s;peaking many <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> words, as, <HI>Cappitan, Commarado,</HI> and <HI>Adues.</HI> They know the u&s;e of Guns, and are as little &s;tartled at the firing of a Peece of Ordnance, as he that hath been u&s;ed to them many years: they told us the neare&s;t <HI>Spanyards</HI> were at St. <HI>Augu&s;tins,</HI> and &s;everal of them had been there, which as they &s;aid was but ten days journey; and
<PB N="3" REF="3">
that the <HI>Spanyards</HI> u&s;ed to come to them at Saint <HI>Ellens,</HI> &s;ometimes in Canoa's within Land, at other times in &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els by Sea, which the <HI>Indians</HI> de&s;cribe to have but two Ma&s;ts. They invited us to come to St. <HI>Ellens</HI> with our Ship, which they told us we might do within Land. <HI>Munday</HI> the 14 <HI>September,</HI> our Long-Boat went with twelve hands within Land to St. <HI>Ellens.</HI> On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 16th, came five <HI>Indians</HI> on board us; one of them pointing to another, &s;aid, he was the Grandy Captain of <HI>Edi&s;tow:</HI> whereupon we took e&s;pecial notice of him, and entertained him accordingly, giving him &s;everal Beads, &amp; other trade that plea&s;ed him well: He invited us to bring up our Ship into a branch on the N. E. &s;ide, and told us of one Captain <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> and four more Engli&s;h that were in his cu&s;tody on &s;hoar; whereupon we &s;hew|ed him &s;tore of all Trade, as Beads, Hoes, Hatchets and Bills, &amp;c. and &s;aid, he &s;hould have all tho&s;e things if he would bring the Engli&s;h on board us; which he promi&s;ed &s;hould be done the next day. Here|upon we wrote a few lines to the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> fearing it to be a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> delu&s;ion to entrap us. In the dark of the &s;ame Evening came a Canoa with nine or ten <HI>In|dians</HI> in her with their Bowes and Arrows, and were clo&s;e on board before we did di&s;cern them: We ha|led them, but they made us no an&s;wer, which increa|&s;ed our jealou&s;ie: So we commanded them on board, and di&s;armed them, detaining two of them pri&s;oners, and &s;ending away the re&s;t to fetch the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which if they brought, they &s;hould have theirs again. At length they delivered us a Note written with a coal, which &s;eemed the more to continue our jealou&s;ie, be|cau&s;e in all this time we had no news of our long-boat
<PB N="4" REF="4">
from St. <HI>Ellens,</HI> which we feared was &s;urpri|zed by the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spanyards.</HI> But to &s;atisfie us that there were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on &s;hoar, they &s;ent us one man on board about twelve of the clock in the Night who related to us the truth of the matter, and told us they were ca&s;t away &s;ome four or five leagues to the North-ward of the place we then rode, on the 24th of <HI>July</HI> pa&s;t, being thirteen per&s;ons that came on &s;hoar, whereof three of them were kill'd by the <HI>Indians.</HI> On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 17th of <HI>September</HI> the Long-boat returned from St. <HI>Ellens,</HI> which pre&s;ently we &s;ent on &s;hoar to fetch the other <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> delivering us three more; and coming abroad them|&s;elves, we delivered them their two men. Then we demanded of the chief Commander where the re&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were: he an&s;wered, Five were carried to St. <HI>Ellens,</HI> three were killed by the <HI>Stonohs,</HI> and the other man we &s;hould have within two dayes. We replyed to him again, That we would keep him and two more of his chief men, till we had our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were yet living; and promi&s;ed them their li|berty, with &s;atisfaction for bringing us the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Now to return to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of our De&s;ign; the entertainment we had at S. <HI>Ellens</HI> put us in great fear of the <HI>Indians</HI> treachery; for we ob&s;erved their con|tinual gathering together, and at la&s;t began with &s;tern-look'd countenances to &s;peak roughly to us, and came to &s;earch our mens Bandileers and Pockets; yet inviting us to &s;tay that night with them: but we made a &s;udden retreat to our Boat, which cau&s;ed the <HI>Indian</HI> King to be in a great rage, &s;peaking loud and angry to his men; the drift of which di&s;cour&s;e we under&s;tood not. That which we noted there, was a
<PB N="5" REF="4">
fair hou&s;e builded in the &s;hape of a Dove-hou&s;e, round, two hundred foot at lea&s;t, compleatly cover|ed with <HI>Palmeta</HI>-leaves, the wal-plate being twelve foot high, or thereabouts, &amp; within lodging Rooms and Forms; two pillars at the entrance of a high Seat above all the re&s;t: Al&s;o another hou&s;e like a Sentinel-hou&s;e, floored ten foot high with planks, fa&s;tned with Spikes and Nayls, &s;tanding upon &s;ub|&s;tantial Po&s;ts, with &s;everal other &s;mall hou&s;es round about. Al&s;o we &s;aw many planks, to the quantity of three thou&s;and foot or thereabouts, with other Tim|ber &s;quared, and a Cro&s;s before the great hou&s;e. Likewi&s;e we &s;aw the Ruines of an old Fort, compa&s;|&s;ing more than half an acre of land within the Tren|ches, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Charls</HI>'s Fort, built, and &s;o called by the <HI>French</HI> in 1562, &amp;c. On <HI>Mon|day, September</HI> 21. one Engli&s;h youth was brought from St. <HI>Ellens</HI> aboard us by an <HI>Indian,</HI> who inform|ed us that there were four more of their company at St. <HI>Ellens,</HI> but he could not tell whether the <HI>Indians</HI> would let them come to us: For &s;aith he, Our Men told me, that they had lately &s;een a Frier and two <HI>Spany|ards</HI> more at St. <HI>Ellens,</HI> who told them they would &s;end Soldiers &s;uddenly to fetch them away. This day we &s;ayled up the River with our Ship to go through to St. <HI>Ellens.</HI> On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 22 in&s;tant, three <HI>Indians</HI> came on board; one of them we &s;ent with a Letter to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners there. On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 23d. we &s;ent out Boat and Men to &s;ound the Chanel, and finde out the mo&s;t likely way to St. <HI>Ellens</HI> with our Ship by <HI>Combeheh.</HI> In the mean time came many Canoa's aboard us with Corn, Pumpions, and Ve|ni&s;on, Deer-skins, and a &s;ort of &s;weet-wood. One
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of our men looking into an <HI>Indian</HI> basket, found a piece of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Rusk: it being new, we demanded of the <HI>Indian</HI> where he had it; who &s;aid, Of the <HI>Spani|ards.</HI> In the interim, while we were talking, came a Canoa with four <HI>Indians</HI> from St. <HI>Ellens,</HI> one &s;tand|ing up, and holding a paper in a cleft &s;tick; they told us they had brought it from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain at St. <HI>Ellens.</HI> We demanded how many <HI>Spaniards</HI> were come thither; who &s;aid, Seven, and one <HI>Eng|li&s;h-man:</HI> We received their Letter writ in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> but none of us could read it: We detained two of the chiefe&s;t <HI>Indians,</HI> one of them being the Kings Son of S. <HI>Ellens,</HI> and that kept one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pri&s;o|ners&punc; the other two we &s;ent away with a Letter to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> wherein we gave him to under&s;tand, that we under&s;tood not his letter; and told the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> when they brought the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they &s;hould have their men again, with &s;atisfaction for their pains. On <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> 24 in&s;tant, we &s;ayling further up the River to go through, at la&s;t came to a place of fre&s;h water, and Anchored there, &s;ending our Boat a&s;hoar with a Guard to get water. Towards night came the fir&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> that we &s;ent to St. <HI>Ellens</HI> with a letter to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who brought us another letter from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and an An&s;wer of ours from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> writ in the <HI>Spaniards</HI> letter. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;ent us a quarter of Veni&s;on, and a quarter of Pork, with a Complement, That he was &s;orry he had no more for us at that time. We returned him thanks, and &s;ent him a Jug of Brandy; and withal, that we were &s;orry we under&s;tood not his letter. This night about twelve of the Clock we had a mo&s;t violent gu&s;t of winde, but of no long

continuance. On <HI>Friday</HI> 25 <HI>September,</HI> we weighed, and returned down the River &s;ix leagues, or therea|bouts, becau&s;e we perceived the <HI>Indians</HI> had gather|ed them&s;elves in a Body from all parts thereabouts, and moved as the Ship did: and being informed by an <HI>Indian,</HI> that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would be there the next day; we took in Fire-wood, and continued there that night, at which time one of our <HI>Indian</HI> Pri&s;on|ers made his e&s;cape by leaping over-board in the dark. On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 26. we weighed, and &s;tood down to the Harbours mouth, and &s;tayed there till <HI>Monday</HI> the 28. In all which time came no one to us, though we &s;tay'd in expectation of their coming con|tinually; therefore put out to Sea, concluding their intentions not to be good. Being out of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> we directed our cour&s;e S. W. four leagues or thereabouts for <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> to &s;ound the Chanel without from the poynts of the Harbour outwards; for we had &s;ounded the Harbour within from the points inward when our Boat was at St. <HI>Ellens:</HI> And now being athwart the Harbours mouth, we &s;ent our Boat with the Mate and others, who found the N. E. and E. N. E. &s;ide of the opening of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> to be Sholes and Breakers to the middle of the open|ing; and three leagues or thereabouts into the Sea, from the &s;ide afore&s;aid, is un&s;afe to meddle with: but the S. W. and W. &s;ide we found all bold &s;teering in N. N. W. two or three miles from the S. W. &s;hoar, &s;ayling directed with the S. W. head-land of the en|trance of <HI>Port-Royal:</HI> the &s;aid head-land is bluft, and &s;eems &s;teep, as though the trees hung over the wa|ter: But you mu&s;t note, that if you keep &s;o far from the S. W. &s;ide, that you &s;tand in N. N. W. with
<PB N="8" REF="6">
the bluft head afore&s;aid, you &s;hall go over the Out|skirt of the E. N. E. &s;holing, and &s;hall have but three or four fathom for the &s;pace of one league or thereabouts, and then you &s;hall have &s;ix and &s;even fathoms all the way in: But if you borrow more on the S. W. &s;ide, till you have brought the S. W. head of the Entry to bear N. N. E. you &s;hall have a fair large Chanel of &s;ix, &s;even, and eight fathoms all the way in, and then five, &s;ix, &s;even and eight fa|thoms within the Harbour, keeping the Chanel, and &s;tanding over to the Northward: we &s;uppo&s;ed that it flows here as at the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> becau&s;e they are but four leagues a&s;under, and flows S. E. and N. W. &s;even foot and half, and &s;ometimes eight foot perpendicular: the Mouth of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> lyes in 32 deg. 20 min. lat. Now as concerning the entrance of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> lat. 32 deg. 30 min. or there|abouts, you &s;hall &s;ee a range of Breakers right a|gain&s;t the opening, two or three leagues off the S. W. Point; which you mu&s;t leave to the Northward, and &s;teer in with the &s;aid S. W. Point, giving a range of Breakers that runs from the &s;aid Point a &s;mall birth, and you &s;hall have two, three, and four fa|thoms at low water; and when you come one mile from the Point afore&s;aid, &s;teer over directly to the N. E. Point, and you &s;hall have &s;ix or &s;even fathom all the way. VVithin the <HI>N. W.</HI> Point is good An|choring: you &s;hall have five fathoms fair aboard the &s;hoar: and you &s;hall have five, &s;ix, &s;even, and eight fathoms, &s;ayling all along upon the River, ten leagues, and a large turning Chanel: It flows here <HI>S. E.</HI> and <HI>N. W.</HI> &s;even foot and a half, and eight foot at common Tydes. The River <HI>Grandy,</HI> or as the <HI>In|dians</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
call it <HI>Edi&s;tow,</HI> lyes &s;ix leagues or thereabouts from the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> and &s;eems to be a very fair o|pening: but becau&s;e the chief <HI>Indian</HI> of that Place was on board us, and the Countrey all in Arms, we not knowing how the winde might cro&s;&s;e us, it was not thought fit to &s;tay there: But &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that had lived there, being Pri&s;oners, &s;ay, that it is a very fair and goodly River, branching in|to &s;everal branches, and deep, and is fre&s;h water at low Tide within two leagues of the Mouth; it &s;eem|ing to us as we pa&s;&s;ed by, a good entrance large and wide, lat. 32 deg. 40 min. in or thereabouts. Now our under&s;tanding of the Land of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> River <HI>Jordan,</HI> River <HI>Grandie,</HI> or <HI>Edi&s;tow,</HI> is as followeth: The Lands are laden with large tall Oaks, VValnut and Bayes, except facing on the Sea, it is mo&s;t Pines tall and good: The Land generally, except where the Pines grow, is a good Soyl, covered with black Mold, in &s;ome places a foot, in &s;ome places half a foot, and in other places le&s;&s;e, with Clay under|neath mixed with Sand; and we think may produce any thing as well as mo&s;t part of the Indies that we have &s;een. The <HI>Indians</HI> plant in the wor&s;t Land, be|cau&s;e they cannot cut down the Timber in the be&s;t, and yet have plenty of Corn, Pumpions, Water-Mellons, Musk-mellons: although the Land be o|ver-grown with weeds through their lazine&s;&s;e, yet they have two or three crops of Corn a year, as the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves inform us. The Country abounds with Grapes, large Figs, and Peaches; the Woods with Deer, Conies, Turkeys, Quails, Curlues, Plovers, Teile, Herons; and as the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ay, in Winter, with Swans, Gee&s;e, Cranes, Duck

and Mallard, and innumerable of other water-Fowls, who&s;e names we know not, which lie in the Rivers, Mar&s;hes, and on the Sands: Oy&s;ters in a|bundance, with great &s;tore of Mu&s;cles; A &s;ort of fair Crabs, and a round Shel&punc;fi&s;h called <HI>Hor&s;e&punc;feet;</HI> The Rivers &s;tored plentifully with Fi&s;h that we &s;aw play and leap. There are great Mar&s;hes, but mo&s;t as far as we &s;aw little worth, except for a Root that grows in them the <HI>Indians</HI> make good Bread of. The Land we &s;uppo&s;e is healthful; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were ca&s;t away on that Coa&s;t in <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, were there mo&s;t part of that time of year that is &s;ickly in <HI>Virgi|nia;</HI> and notwith&s;tanding hard u&s;age, and lying on the ground naked, yet had their perfect healths all the time. The Natives are very healthful; we &s;aw many very Aged among&s;t them. The Ayr is clear and &s;weet, the Countrey very plea&s;ant and delight|ful: And we could wi&s;h, that all they that want a happy &s;ettlement, of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, were well tran&s;ported thither, &amp;c.</P>

On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 4th, we went five or &s;ix leagues up the River to &s;earch a branch that ran out of the main River towards the <HI>N.

Thur&s;day</HI> the fifth in|&s;tant, we &s;taid aboard; on <HI>Friday</HI> the 6th we went up <HI>Greens</HI> River, the mouth of it being again&s;t the place we rode with our Ship. On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 7th, we
<PB N="13" REF="8">
proceeded up the &s;aid River &s;ome fourteen or fifteen leagues in all, and found that it ended in &s;everal &s;mall branches; the Land for the mo&s;t part being mar&s;hy and &s;wamps, we returned towards our &s;hip, and got aboard in the night: <HI>Sunday</HI> the 8th in&s;tant we lay &s;till, and on <HI>Monday</HI> the 9th we went again up the main River, being well provided with Pro|vi&s;ions and all things nece&s;&s;ary, and proceeded up|wards till <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> noon 12th in&s;tant, at which time we came to a place where two I&s;lands were in the middle of the River, and by rea&s;on of the crooked|ne&s;&s;e of the <HI>River</HI> at that place, &s;everal Trees lay a|thwart both branches, which &s;topped up the pa&s;&s;age of each branch, that we could proceed no further with our Boat; but we went up the River &s;ide by land &s;ome three or four miles, and found the River to enlarge it &s;elf: So we returned, leaving it as far as we could &s;ee up a long reach running N. E. we judging our &s;elves from the Rivers mouth North near fifty leagues; we returned, viewing the Land on both &s;ides the River, and found as good tracts of land, dry, well wooded, plea&s;ant and delightful as we have &s;een any where in the world, with great burthen of Gra&s;&s;e on it, the land being very level, with &s;teep banks on both &s;ides the River, and in &s;ome places very high, the woods &s;tor'd with abun|dance of Deer and Turkies every where; we never going on &s;hoar, but &s;aw of each al&s;o Partridges great &s;tore, Cranes abundance, Comes, which we &s;aw in &s;everal places; we heard &s;everal Wolves howling in the woods, and &s;aw where they had torn a Deer in pieces. Al&s;o in the River we &s;aw great &s;tore of Ducks, T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ile, VVidgeon, and in the woods great flocks of

Parrakeeto's; the Timber that the woods afford for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ting of Oaks of four or five &s;orts, all differing in leaves, but all bearing Akorns very good: we mea&s;ured many of the Oaks in &s;everal pla|ces, which we found to be in bigne&s;&s;e &s;ome tvvo, &s;ome three, and others almo&s;t four fathoms; in height, before you come to boughs or limbs, forty, fifty, &s;ixty foot, and &s;ome more, and tho&s;e Oaks very common in the upper parts of both Rivers; Al&s;o a very tall large Tree of great bigne&s;&s;e, which &s;ome do call <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the right name we know not, growing in Swamps. Likewi&s;e Walnut, Birch, Beech, Ma|ple, A&s;h, Bay, Willough, Alder and Holly; and in the lowermo&s;t parts innumerable of Pines, tall and good for boards or ma&s;ts, growing for the mo&s;t part in barren &s;andy ground, but in &s;ome places up the River in good ground, being mixed among&s;t Oaks and other Timber. We &s;aw &s;everal Mulberry|trees, multitudes of Grape-Vines, and &s;ome Grapes which we did eat of. VVe found a very large and good tract of Land on the N. W. &s;ide of the River, thin of Timber, except here and there a very great Oak, and full of Gra&s;&s;e, commonly as high as a mans middle, and in many places to his &s;houlders, where we &s;aw many Deer and Turkies; al&s;o one Deer with very large horns, and great in body, therefore called it <HI>Stag-Park&punc;</HI> it being a very plea&s;ant and delightful place, we travelled in it &s;everal miles, but &s;aw no end thereof. So we returned to our Boat, and pro|ceeded down the River, and came to another place &s;ome twenty five leagues from the Rivers mouth on the &s;ame &s;ide, where we found a place no le&s;&s;e delightful than the former&punc; and as far as we
<PB N="15" REF="9">
could judge, both Tracts came into one. This low|er place we called <HI>Rocky-point,</HI> becau&s;e we found ma|ny Rocks and Stones of &s;everal bigne&s;&s;e upon the Land, which is not common. We &s;ent our Boat down the River before us; our &s;elves travelling by Land many miles, were &s;o much taken with the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of the Land, that travelling into the woods &s;o far, we could not recover our Boat and company that night. On <HI>Sunday</HI> the morrow follow|ing we got to our Boat, and on <HI>Monday</HI> the 16th of <HI>November,</HI> we proceeded down to a place on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the River &s;ome twenty three leagues from the Harbours mouth, which we call'd <HI>Turkie-Quarters,</HI> becau&s;e we killed &s;everal Turkies there|abouts. VVe viewed the Land there, and found &s;ome tracts of good Land, and high, facing upon the River about one mile inward, but backwards &s;ome two miles all Pine-land, but good pa&s;ture-ground: we returned to our Boat, and proceeded down &s;ome two or three leagues, where we had formerly view|ed, and found it a tract of as good Land as any we have &s;een, with as good Timber on it. The banks of the River being high, therefore we called it <HI>High-Land Point.</HI> Having viewed that, we proceeded down the River, going on &s;hoar in &s;everal places on both &s;ides&punc; it being generally large Mar&s;hes, and many of them dry, that they may more fitly be called Medows: the wood-land again&s;t them is for the mo&s;t part Pine, and in &s;ome places as barren as ever we &s;aw Land, but in other places good Pa&s;ture&punc;ground, And on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 17th in&s;tant, we got aboard our Ship, riding again&s;t the mouth of <HI>Green</HI>'s River, where our men are providing wood, and fitting the
<PB N="16" REF="10">
Ship for the Sea: In the interim, we took &s;ome view of the Land on both &s;ides of the River there, finding &s;ome good Land, but more bad, and the be&s;t not com|parable to that above. <HI>Friday</HI> the 20th in&s;tant was foul weather, yet in the Afternoon we weighed, and went down the River &s;ome two leagues, and came to Anchor again&s;t the mouth of <HI>Hilton</HI>'s River, and took &s;ome view of the Land there on both &s;ides, which appeared to us much like unto that at <HI>Green</HI>'s River. <HI>Monday</HI> 23. we went with our Long-boat well victualled and manned up <HI>Hilton</HI>'s River; and when we came three leagues or thereabouts up the &s;aid River, we found this and <HI>Green</HI>'s River to come into one, and &s;o continued for four or five leagues, which cau&s;eth a great I&s;land betwixt them. We proceeded &s;till up the River, till they parted a|gain, keeping up <HI>Hilton</HI>'s River on the Lar-board &s;ide, and followed the &s;aid River five or &s;ix leagues further, where we found another large branch of <HI>Green</HI>'s River to come into <HI>Hilton</HI>'s, which maketh another great I&s;land. On the Star-board &s;ide going up, we proceeded &s;til up the River &s;ome four leagues, and returned, taking a view of the Land on both &s;ides, and now judge our &s;elves to be from our &s;hip &s;ome eighteen leagues <HI>W.</HI> and by <HI>W.</HI> One league be|low this place came four <HI>Indians</HI> in a Canoa to us, and &s;old us &s;everal baskets of Akorns, which we &s;a|tisfied for, and &s;o left them; but one of them follow|ed us on the &s;hoar &s;ome two or three miles, till he came on the top of a high bank, facing on the <HI>River,</HI> we rowing underneath it, the &s;aid <HI>Indian</HI> &s;hot an Arrow at us, which mi&s;&s;ed one of our men very nar|rowly, and &s;tuck in the upper edge of the Boat, which
<PB N="17" REF="10">
broke in pieces, leaving the head behind. Hereup|on we pre&s;ently made to the &s;hoar, and went all up the bank except four to guide the Boat; we &s;earched for the <HI>Indian,</HI> but could not finde him: At la&s;t we heard &s;ome &s;ing further in the Woods, which we thought had been as a Chalenge to us to come and fight them. We went towards them with all &s;peed, but before we came in &s;ight of them, we heard two Guns go off from our Boat, whereupon we retreat|ed with all &s;peed to &s;ecure our Boat and Men: when we came to them, we found all well, &amp; demanded the rea&s;on of their firing the Guns: they told us that an <HI>Indian</HI> came creeping on the Bank as they thought to &s;hoot at them, therefore &s;hot at him a great di&s;tance with Swan-&s;hot, but thought they did him no hurt, for they &s;aw him run way. Pre&s;ently after our re|turn to the Boat, while we were thus talking, came two <HI>Indians</HI> to us with their Bows and Arrows, cry|ing <HI>Bonny, Bonny:</HI> we took their Bows and Arrows from them, and gave them Beads, to their content. Then we led them by the hand to the Boat, and &s;hew|ed them the Arrow-head &s;ticking in her &s;ide, and re|lated to them the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; which when they under|&s;tood, both of them manife&s;ted much &s;orrow, and made us under&s;tand by &s;ignes, that they knew no|thing of it: &s;o we let them go, and marked a Tree on the top of the bank, calling the place <HI>Mount-Skerry.</HI> We looked up the River as far as we could di&s;cern, and &s;aw that it widened it &s;elf, and came running directly down the Countrey: So we return|ed, and viewed the Land on both &s;ides the River, fin|ding the banks &s;teep in &s;ome places, but very high in others. The banks &s;ides are generally Clay, and
<PB N="18" REF="11">
as &s;ome of our company doth affirm, &s;ome Marle. The Land and Timber up this River is no way inferi|our to the be&s;t in the other, which we call the main River: So far as we di&s;covered, this &s;eems as fair, if not fairer than the former, and we think runs further into the Countrey, becau&s;e there is a &s;trong Current comes down, and a great deal more drift-wood. But to return to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Land and Timber: We &s;aw &s;everal plats of Ground cleared by the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> after their weak manner, compa&s;&s;ed round with great Timber-Trees; which they are no ways able to fall, and &s;o keep the Sun from their Corn-fields very much; yet neverthele&s;&s;e we &s;aw as large Corn-&s;talks or bigger, than we have &s;een any where el&s;e: So we proceeded down the River, till we found the Canoa the <HI>Indian</HI> was in who &s;hot at us. In the morn|ing we went on &s;hoar, and cut the &s;ame in pieces: the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving us coming towards them, run away. We went to his Hut, and pulled it down, brake his pots, platters, and &s;poons, tore his Deer|skins and Mats in pieces, and took away a basket of Akorns: So we proceeded down the River two leagues, or thereabouts, and came to another place of <HI>Indians,</HI> bought Akorns and &s;ome Corn of them, and went downwards two leagues more: at la&s;t we e&s;pied an <HI>Indian</HI> peeping over a high bank: we held up a Gun at him; and calling to him, &s;aid, <HI>Skerry:</HI> pre&s;ently &s;everal <HI>Indians</HI> appeared to us, making great &s;ignes of friend&s;hip, &s;aying, <HI>Bonny, Bonny,</HI> and running before us, endeavouring to per&s;wade us to come on &s;hoar; but we an&s;wered them with &s;tern countenances, and &s;aid, <HI>Skerry,</HI> taking up our guns, and threatning to &s;hoot at them; but they cryed &s;till
<PB N="19" REF="11">
<HI>Bonny, Bonny:</HI> And when they &s;aw they could not pre|vail, nor per&s;wade us to come on &s;hoar, two of them came off to us in a Canoa, one padling with a great Cane, the other with his hand; they came to us, and laid hold of our Boat, &s;weating and blowing, and told us it was <HI>Bonny</HI> on &s;hoar, and at la&s;t per&s;wa|ded us to go a&s;hoar with them. As &s;oon as we land|ed, &s;everal <HI>Indians,</HI> to the number of near forty lu&s;ty men, came to us, all in a great &s;weat, and told us <HI>Bonny:</HI> we &s;hewed&punc; them the Arrow-head in the Boats-&s;ide, and a piece of the Canoa which we had cut in pieces: the chief man of them made a large Speech, and threw Beads into our Boat, which is a &s;igne of great love and friend&s;hip; and made us to under&s;tand, when he heard of the Affront which we had received, it cau&s;ed him to cry: and now he and his men were come to make peace with us, making &s;ignes to us that they would tye his Arms, and cut off his head that had done us that abu&s;e; and for a further te&s;timony of their love and good will towards us, they pre&s;ented to us two very hand&s;om propet young <HI>Indian</HI> women, the talle&s;t that we have &s;een in this Countrey; which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Kings Daughters, or per&s;ons of &s;ome great account among&s;t them. The&s;e young women were ready to come into our Boat; one of them crouding in, was hardly per|&s;waded to go out again. We pre&s;ented to the King a Hatchet and &s;everal Beads, al&s;o Beads to the young women and to the chief men, and to the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as far as our Beads would go: they promi|&s;ed us in four days to come on board our Ship, and &s;o departed from us. When we left the place, which
<PB N="20" REF="12">
was pre&s;ently, we called it <HI>Mount-Bonny,</HI> becau&s;e we had there concluded a firm Peace. Proceeding down the River two or three leagues further, we came to a place where were nine or ten Canoa's all together; we went a&s;hoar there, and found &s;everal <HI>Indians,</HI> but mo&s;t of them were the &s;ame which had made Peace with us before: We made little &s;tay there, but went directly down the River, and came to our Ship before day. <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 26th of <HI>No|vember,</HI> the winde being at South, we could not go down to the Rivers mouth: but on <HI>Friday</HI> the 27th, we weighed at the mouth of <HI>Hilton</HI>'s River, and got down one league towards the Harbours mouth. On <HI>Sunday</HI> the 29th, we got down to <HI>Crane-I&s;land,</HI> which is four leagues or thereabouts above the Entrance of the Harbours mouth. Now on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> we made a purcha&s;e of the River and land of <HI>Cape-Fair,</HI> of <HI>Wattcoo&s;a,</HI> and &s;uch other <HI>Indians</HI> as appeared to us to be the chief of tho&s;e parts: they brought us &s;tore of Fre&s;h-fi&s;h aboard, as Mullets, Shads, and other very good Fi&s;h: this River is all Fre&s;h-water fit to drink. Some eight leagues within the mouth, the Tide runs up about thirty five leagues, but &s;tops and ri&s;eth a great deal farther up; it flowes at the Harbours mouth S. E. and N. W. &s;ix foot as Neap-Tides, and eight foot at Spring-Tides: the Chanel on the Ea&s;ter-&s;ide by the <HI>Cape-&s;hoar</HI> is the be&s;t, and lyes clo&s;e aboard the <HI>Cape-land,</HI> being three fathoms at High-water, in the &s;hallowe&s;t place in the Chanel ju&s;t at the Entrance; but as &s;oon as you are pa&s;t that place half a Cables length inward, you &s;hall have &s;ix or &s;even fathoms, a fair turning Cha|nel into the River, and &s;o continuing four or five
<PB N="21" REF="12">
leagues upwards; afterwards the Chanel is more difficult in &s;ome places &s;ix or &s;even fathoms, four or five, and in other places but nine or ten foot, e|&s;pecially where the River is broad. When the River comes to part, and grows narrow, there is all Cha|nel from &s;ide to &s;ide in mo&s;t places; in &s;ome places you &s;hall have five, &s;ix, or &s;even fathoms, but ge|nerally two or three, Sand and Oaze. We viewed the Cape-land, and judged it to be little worth, the Woods of it &s;hrubby and low, the Land &s;andy and barren; in &s;ome places Gra&s;s and Ru&s;hes, and in other places nothing but clear &s;and: a place fitter to &s;tarve Cattel in our judgement, then to keep them alive; yet the <HI>Indians,</HI> as we under&s;tand, keep the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cattle down there, and &s;uffer them not to go off the &s;aid Cape, as we &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e the Countrey-<HI>Indians</HI> &s;hall have to part with them, and as we think, are fallen out about them, who &s;hall have the greate&s;t &s;hare. They brought aboard our Ship very good and fat Beef &s;everal times, which they could afford very rea&s;onable; al&s;o fat and very large Swine, good cheap penny-worths: but they may thank their friends of <HI>New-England,</HI> who brought their Hogs to &s;o fair a Market. Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> brought very good Salt aboard us, and made &s;ignes, pointing to both &s;ides of the Rivers mouth, that there was great &s;tore thereabouts. We &s;aw up the River &s;everal good places for the &s;etting up of Corn or Saw-mills. In that time as our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e called us up and down the River and Branches, we kill'd of wild|fowl, four Swans, ten Gee&s;e, twenty nine Cranes, ten Turkies, forty Duck and Mallard, three dozen of Parrakeeto's, and &s;ix or &s;even dozen of other &s;mall Fowls, as Curlues and Plovers, &amp;c.</P>

<P>MY Governour and Capt.

This they de&s;ire, not as payment, but onely as an acknowledgment of a kindne&s;s for having &s;aved their lives; which they have always done as Naturals who have given their obedience to the King our Ma|&s;ter. And they do al&s;o de&s;ire you to let go tho&s;e four <HI>Indians</HI> which are there: You may &s;end a Boat when you di&s;cover the Points of St. <HI>Ellens;</HI> may hoi&s;t an Ancient two or three times, and I will do the &s;ame.
