<HEAD>The mi&s;erable e&s;tate of the Cittie of Paris at this pre&s;ent, with a true report of &s;undrie &s;traunge vi&s;ions, lately &s;eene in <HI>the ayre vpon the Coa&s;t of Britaine both by Sea and lande.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe pre&s;ent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed e&s;tate of the Citie of Paris, as it is vnknowen to &s;ome, &s;o it is well knowen vnto many thou&s;and per&s;ons that daily f&eacute;ele the force and bitterne&s;&s;e therof. The &s;ame being mo&s;t extreame and lamentable, I could doe no le&s;&s;e but lay it open to the view of the whole worlde that all the Cities in Chri|&s;tendome may take example by the &s;ame, and feare hereaf|ter to attempt the like inhumaine, vnnaturall and mo&s;t vn|godly actions, which aboue all other that Citie hath &s;undrie times committed, e&s;pecially in two points: fir&s;t, in &s;laugh|tering the bloud of many thou&s;ande innocents, and &s;econd|ly for re&s;i&s;ting and rebelling from time to time again&s;t the authoritie of their Soueraigne and Chri&s;tian King, where|in they haue of long time p&eacute;eui&s;hly continued. For which their &s;o in&s;olent crimes, doubtles almighty God doth iu&s;tly plague and puni&s;h them, the rather to make it knowen vn|to them and others, that he is a iu&s;t God, and will puni&s;h the bloud-thir&s;tie and wicked, as he hath promi&s;ed, euen to the third and fourth generation.</P>
<P>Such haue b&eacute;ene the crimes of tho&s;e proude and di&s;loyal Pari&s;eans, (who of late yeares liued in great pro&s;peritie, and abounded in wealth) that in the life time of that bloud|thir&s;tie Butcher, and vnnaturall Murtherer of Chri&s;tians called the Duke of Guize, with the con&s;ent of the Qu&eacute;ene mother and her a&s;&s;ociates, &s;uffered to be accompli&s;hed and performed within the &s;aide Citie, a lamentable Ma&s;&s;acre of many thou&s;and innocents in one night, and &s;uch e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="4" REF="3"> as were of the flower and chiefe of the Nobilitie of France, the fact being yet &s;o fre&s;h in memorie, that the bloud of tho&s;e then &s;laughtered a&s;keth reuenge and craueth bloud againe vpon tho&s;e hard hearted helhoundes and their po&s;teritie, now maintayners of their vnholy League, that long time haue re&s;i&s;ted the authoritie of the higher powers, and giuen their con&s;ents to &s;&eacute;eke the di&s;&s;olution and ruine of that kingdome, and the &s;ubuer&s;ion of their King, his Crowne and dignitie Royall, as they haue doone from time to time. For which their &s;o horrible actions, together with their gr&eacute;euous crimes and dete&s;table pride, whore|dome, ince&s;t, gluttony, and &s;uch like abhominable vices which they of long time v&s;ed, it hath plea&s;ed God to &s;ende among them extreame famine (a &s;harpe me&s;&s;enger of re|uenge to puni&s;h them) whereby they are at this pre&s;ent in &s;uch gr&eacute;euous di&s;tre&s;&s;e as it is lamentable to report. For the Citie is be&s;ieged round about by the kinges power which is very &s;trong, and therby hath cut them off from ha|uing any victuals or other &s;uccour what&s;oeuer, their victu|als within was &s;pent long &s;ince, whereby they are in wo|full ea&s;e for want of foode. They are enforced to eate Hor|&s;es, A&s;&s;es, Dogges, Cattes, Rattes, Mice, and other fil|thie and vnaccu&s;tomed things for their &s;u&s;tenance, yea that which is more odious in re&s;pect of their nece&s;&s;itie, it is &s;ayd that they are enforced to f&eacute;ede one vpon an other: and that through f&eacute;eblene&s;&s;e and want of victuals they fall downe dead in the &s;tr&eacute;etes and in their hou&s;es. A mo&s;t lamentable and vnaccu&s;tomed thing to be done, yet con&s;trayned &s;o to doe by meanes of their want and gr&eacute;euous famine, which is now generally among them. This their nece&s;&s;itie may be compared to the want &amp; mi&s;erable e&s;tate of the Iewes at the &s;iedge of Ieru&s;alem, where death threatned the de|&s;truction of all the inhabitants, thereby &s;hewing them that for their wickedne&s;&s;e and wilfull &s;tubbornne&s;&s;e their de&s;tru|ction is at hand.</P>
<P>The Friers and Cleargie men who are the ring lea|ders and principall gouernours there at this pre&s;ent time,
<PB N="5" REF="3"> perceiuing the great nece&s;&s;itie whereunto the Citizens would b&eacute;e driuen, by meanes of their dete&s;table per&s;wa&s;i|ons, dealt pollitickely, &s;ending for the Citizens of Paris into &s;euerall Cloi&s;ters &amp; religious Hou&s;es within the &s;ame Cittie, and commaunded them to bring in all their warlike furniture which they had in their hou&s;es, to the intent that they might &s;&eacute;e if they were &s;eruiceable or not for warre, &s;o when they had gotten al the &s;ame furniture of pikes hal|bards, mu&s;kets, gunnes, dagges, &s;wordes, and &s;uch like, they detained their weapons and &s;ent euery man home a|gain de&s;titute of any furniture, wherwith to defend them|&s;elues if occa&s;ion &s;hould &s;erue, whereby they haue weake|ned the whole multitude of Citizens, and drawen the &s;trength of the Cittie into their owne direction and go|uernment, fearing lea&s;t that famine &s;houlde compell the generall multitude to rebell again&s;t them, and &s;o con&s;trayn the fatte fed Friers to y&eacute;elde to their daily outcries, which is to y&eacute;elde vppe the Cittie into the kinges handes, and to &s;ubmitte them &s;elues to his mercy, which to doe they can not compell them for want of weapons. Some here may happely demaunde, why the Cleargie men and chiefe Ru|lers, will not y&eacute;elde it vppe as well as the re&s;t, rather then to ta&s;te of famine and &s;o to &s;uffer &s;o grieuous and cruell a torment, which is more bitter then death, but for aun&s;wer thereto let this &s;uffice. The Leagers and Cleargy men of the Cittie, &s;u&s;pecting long before that &s;uch mi&s;ery would come to pa&s;&s;e, did vitaile them&s;elues for a long time, &s;o that tho&s;e e&s;pecially that are chiefe gouernours, Officers, Watchmen, and Guard to the Cittie, haue yet &s;ome &s;uf|ficient maintenance, neuertheles the ordinary Friers are not far differing from the generall &s;tate of the lay men in that Citty, for they are almo&s;t &s;tarued by rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> their &s;mall allowance, &s;o that mo&s;t of them looke like vnto wild men, who&s;e countenance is leane and &s;tearne, as willing to &s;natch at the quarter of a good dogge, as &s;oone as any other, though it co&s;t twentie &s;hillings, as at this pre&s;ent it is worth among them. This is the true e&s;tate of the
<PB N="6" REF="4"> &s;aid Citty and inhabitants therein, who&s;e mi&s;ery is doubt|les &s;ent of God, as a &s;harpe &s;courge for their &s;o great wic|kedne&s;&s;e and di&s;obedience towards God and their Soue|raigne. Thus doth God &s;till harden the hearts of the Go|uernours, and maketh them wilfull, blinde, and fooli&s;he in their owne fancie, that their puni&s;hment for their wicked|nes might be the more &s;harpe and grieuous. The Prince of Parma for certaintie hath entered France with tenne thou&s;and men of hor&s;e and foote, but &s;oone after hee pa&s;&s;ed the borders, intending to aide tho&s;e of the Legue, the Kings power gaue him a battaile and di&s;comfited thr&eacute;e thou&s;and of his men. They of the League are very &s;or|rowfull for that the towne of Moutriall in Pickardy is yeelded vp to the King, which is of certaine troth &amp; done verie lately. A generall Battaile is daily expected forth|with, betweene the Duke de Mayne and the Chri&s;tian King of Fraunce, for whome almighty God daily doth fight, and will doubtles &s;p&eacute;edily deliuer his enemies into his handes, they are within foure leagues one of another on both &s;ides of a riuer. It is therefore very conuenient that all Chri&s;tians &s;hould pray for the good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the King, that it woulde plea&s;e God to giue him victory ouer tho&s;e rebellious and traiterous per&s;ons. At the comming of the Prince of Parma into the French countries, it is re|ported there was vi&s;ibly &s;&eacute;ene in the Aire to all his army, thr&eacute;e raine bowes, and betw&eacute;ene euery one of them the forme of a toade, and pre&s;ently the riuers ther about &s;&eacute;emed nothing but bloud, and &s;o continued for a &s;hort &s;pace, wher|by his army was in great feare, and would willingly haue returned, but they were by their generall commaunded on paine of death to goe forwards. Sundry &s;uch &s;ights haue lately b&eacute;ene &s;&eacute;ene vpon the coa&s;t of France, for one of her Maie&s;ties &s;hippes called the Vangard, being in the nar|row &s;eas, met with nine hulkes and flie boats of the lowe countries bound homeward from Spaine, where the Cap|taine examined them concerning &s;undry matters, who a|mong other things tolde him, that they being on the coa&s;te
<PB N="7" REF="4"> of France, on the one and twentith of Iune la&s;t, in a place called Bell Ile, the Sea round about them was of the cou|lour of blood, for the full &s;pace of halfe an houre, and nothing was to be &s;&eacute;ene but bloud, &s;o farre as they could di&s;cerne, &amp; taking vp the water in their buckets, they could not per|ceiue it from bloud: this the Mai&s;ter and other in the company did &s;weare to be true. Moreouer in Iuly la&s;t pa&s;t the &s;aide &s;hippe of her Maie&s;ties called the Vangard be|ing at Sea, in an euening about &s;etting time of the watch, all the men in the &s;hippe at the ri&s;ing of the Moone, did di&s;|cerne in the ayre ouer the Moone the &s;hape of a man, with a crowne on his head &amp; the king of Spaines armes plaine|ly di&s;plaide, which continued vi&s;ibly to be &s;&eacute;ene for &s;ome &s;mall &s;pace, and &s;oone after it was as a thing ouerthrowne and vani&s;hed away, and &s;&eacute;emed to them as though it were falling.</P>
<P>All which vi&s;ions generall, by the coniecture of &s;undrie of good iudgement, pre&s;ageth the ruine and confu&s;ion of tho&s;e vnwholy Leaguers, vpholden by the Pope and the king of Spaine, and contrariwi&s;e the good &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the French King, who&s;e ancient armes is the thr&eacute;e toades. God for his mercie &s;ake daily defende and protect him, that he may vanqui&s;h all his enemies, which &s;&eacute;eke and pretend his vt|ter confu&s;ion, which God grant for his mercie &s;ake. Amen.</P>
