<HEAD>A PRODIGIOVS Eruption of Fire, which exhaled in the midde&s;t of the Ocean &s;ea, over again&s;t the I&s;le of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> one of the <HI>Tercera's,</HI> and the new I&s;land which it hath made. It tooke beginning the third of Iuly of this pre|&s;ent yeare 1638.</HEAD>
<P>_BEtwixt the Tercera's I&s;lands, &s;o known to tho&s;e who &s;aile to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies and to Bra&s;ile, there is a &s;ite of water in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, di&s;tant two leagues from the I&s;land of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> which the adjoining in|habitants call Ferraria, &s;o abounding with fi&s;h, that it is doubtfull whether there bee any place more plentifull in all the &s;eas. In this place nature hath wrought the mo&s;t portentous ca&s;e that the ages have &s;een, it was thus; On the third of the la&s;t Iuly,
<PB N="6" REF="4"> within the bottome of the &s;ea, which in the &s;ayd place is one hundred and fifty fadomes deepe, like the &s;pringing of a mine, with a horrible noy&s;e and great horror, a &s;pace of earth &s;eparated it &s;elf, which would take the &s;owing of halfe a bu&s;hell of wheate, with the vehemencie and force of an impetuous fire, again&s;t which all the waters of the ocean &s;ea it &s;elfe could make no re&s;i&s;tance, ca&s;ting up to the clouds the water and earth in &s;evered parts, as it were burning torches, and very great &s;tones, &s;ome whereof a&s;cending while others de&s;cended, and &s;o encountring each other, returned by vertue of the new impul&s;e to fly up more than three pikes high: others di&s;&s;olved in pieces, did fly as if they had &s;ai|led large di&s;tances, and the broken pieces beeing handled, di&s;&s;olved into blacke a&s;hes, and all that cir|cuit of water changing its nature, like withered and dry wood, mini&s;treth matter if not aliment to the fire, which without cea&s;ing doth continue burning. A fatall wonder, which is &s;o much the more, to &s;ee that with the multitude of &s;tones which the fire hath ca&s;t up, there is compo&s;ed and formed a new I&s;land, which takes up a league and a half in length, and is three&s;core fadomes high, and it did continue its augmentation and burning until the tenth day of the &s;ayd Iuly, as appeareth by an a&s;&s;ured relation which was &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, whom God protect, and is in the regi&s;try of State belonging to Portu|gall. All the fi&s;h which were within more than eight leagues di&s;tance round about, died con&s;umed,
<PB N="7" REF="4"> and made worth nothing; and the &s;ea ca&s;t forth up|on the &s;hores of the I&s;land of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> &s;o great a quantity, that it would have filled many of tho&s;e &s;hips which &s;aile to the Ea&s;t Indies: and le&s;t the aire &s;hould bee infected, they made great pits in which they buried them. All the &s;ea boyled for many leagues, the &s;mell of the brim&s;tone was felt by the mo&s;t remote of tho&s;e I&s;lands: the &s;moake and the a&s;hes filled the aire, and hid the light of the Sunne, to the admiration of all the inhabitants of tho&s;e I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Before this fire there preceded an earthquake, which continued more than eight dayes, perceived in all tho&s;e &s;eas and I&s;lands, and with a greater noi&s;e in that of Saint <HI>Michael;</HI> &s;o that the inhabitants ter|rified, confounded and a&s;toni&s;hed, le&s;t they &s;hould peri&s;h amid&s;t the ruines of the buildings, fled into the fields, where they remained for &s;ome days, con|fe&s;&s;ing, fa&s;ting, and making proce&s;&s;ions of bloud, and other acts of penance as tho&s;e who feared to to die, either drowned with the I&s;lands them&s;elves, or con&s;umed and burned with another equall fire.</P>
<P>Our Lord God was plea&s;ed that the wind &s;hould be from the land, for had it beene from &s;ea, it had burned all the townes of the neighbouring I&s;lands, and would have occa&s;ioned another cineration like that which hapned in tho&s;e parts in the year 1630.</P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Ba&s;ill.</HI> A TRVE AND PARTICVLAR RELA|tion, of the famous and bloudy bat|taile, fought the 30 day of Iuly old &s;tile, in this pre&s;ent yeare 1638. neare the Village of <HI>Wit|ten-weyer</HI> in the County of <HI>Bri&s;gaw</HI> on the River of Rhyne, how it was fir&s;t begunne, and how it ended according to Gods good will and plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter that Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Saxo~ Weymar had kept his ge|neral Randevouze the 27 of Iu|ly, or 6 of Aug. at <HI>Langendenta|lingen</HI> not farre from <HI>Fry-burg</HI> in the Countie of Bri&s;gaw, and the next day therupo~ following directed his march towards <HI>Kentzingen,</HI> and pitched his Campe neare the &s;aid City. His Highnes recei|ved intelligence by the parties, which he had &s;ent abroad, that the Imperiall and Bavarian Armies with a great number of Wagons, laden with corne,
<PB N="12" REF="7"> meale, and other victuals, were arrived neare the Cloi&s;ter of Shutteren, his Highnes broke up again the &s;ame evening with his whole Army, &amp; marched the whole night, till unto the dawning of the day to meet them, and on Sunday morning being the 29 of Iuly or 8 of Aug: lighted upon both the Gene|rall Field-mar&s;hals, the Duke of Savelly, and <HI>Iohn</HI> Count of Goetz with all their forces not far from the afore&s;aid Cloy&s;ter of Shutteren neare the Vil|lage of Frie&s;enheim, a&s;&s;aulted immediately their Sentinels con&s;i&s;ting of commanded Hor&s;emen, tooke pri&s;oners a Lieutenant with eight hor&s;emen, &amp; &s;lew &s;ome more of the~, and the re&s;t he pur&s;ued to the maine Imperiall Army and by the helpe of cer|tain comma~ded troops of foot, co~&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t part of French, took two pa&s;&s;ages, which the Impe|rialli&s;ts had &s;trongly guarded, and &s;lew there about 60 of the Imperial &s;ouldiers; wherefore the Impe|riali&s;ts to hinder and to prevent a farther pur&s;uite, thought it convenient &amp; good to fire the afore&s;aid Village in &s;everall places; both the Field-mar&s;hals being certified of the unexpected comming of his Highne&s;&s;e, Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> of Saxon Weymar and his &s;uddaine a&s;&s;ault, did beginne to march in good order with their whole Army and Artillery, upon an high and very advantageous hill hard by it, and to play from thence with their Canons upon his Highne&s;&s;e Forces very fiercely and without cea|&s;ing, yet being their Canons plaid too high with|out any great effect and harme; And that they were
<PB N="13" REF="7"> an&s;wered by his Highne&s;&s;e Canons divers times, although not &s;o fiercely and &s;o often, yet with more effect; in the meane time the Mu&s;quetiers skirmi&s;hed one again&s;t another, in&s;omuc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the &s;ame forenoone, on the Imperiall and B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">varian &s;ide, as they them&s;elves confe&s;s'd above 120. men were &s;laine; but on his Highne&s;&s;e &s;ide not ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> 20. killed, and about 30 wounded. And although the French troopes, that were there, &s;eeing they had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;&s;e in the beginning, were very eager to climbe up the Hill, and to a&s;&s;ault the maine Imperi|all Campe, yet his Highne&s;&s;e had di&s;cry'd already, that without great danger and lo&s;&s;e, nothing could be effected: and therefore found it more conveni|ent in his judgement to betake him&s;elfe into the open field hardby, &amp; to put his men into a right Bat|taile-array, hoping that the above&s;aid Generall Field-mar&s;hals, would likewi&s;e re&s;olve to come downe upon his Highne&s;&s;e; being prompted to it by a report and generall rumour of long continu|ance that Field-mar&s;hall <HI>Goetz</HI> de&s;ired much to meet the Duke <HI>Bernhard</HI> upon &s;uch tearmes.</P>
<P>His Ex. wi&s;hed nothing el&s;e but the like occa&s;ion: But being both generalls were loth to breake forth out of their advantages in which they lay, and de&s;i|red not to medle further with his Highnes be&s;ides that which had pa&s;&s;ed with the Cannons and &s;mall skirmi&s;hes aforementioned, his Highne&s;&s;e about noone retired &s;omewhat towards Mohlburg, and thereby gave the more occa&s;ion to both generalls
<PB N="14" REF="8"> Feild Mar&s;halls to betake them&s;elves likewi&s;e downe from the advantageous hill, upon which they lay. The night following was &s;pent on both &s;ides with alarum, and the next munday following being the 30 of Iuly, the 9 of Augu&s;t: his Highne&s;&s;e cau&s;ed the &s;ervice of God and the &s;ermon of the weeping of Chri&s;t over Ieru&s;alem (which the day before by rea&s;on of tho&s;e skirmi&s;hes was neglected) orderly to be performed: and whereas in the con|clu&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;ermon &s;trong proofe was pro|duced, how that God Almighty who is a God of long &s;ufferance doth forbeare a long time the de&s;pi|&s;ers and per&s;ecutors of his holy word, and that al|though they be terrible and mighty for a time, yet cau&s;eth them at la&s;t to bee confounded and over|throwne: his Highne&s;&s;e hereupon tooke finall re|&s;olution, and immediatly thereupon &s;poke the&s;e words to all the Cavalliers that were pre&s;ent, that without further delay he was re&s;olved to fall upon the enemie, with a certaine a&s;&s;urance, that God Al|mighty would grant them this day a glorious victorie, and immediatly thereupon gave order for the whole Armie to breake up, and a&s;&s;oone as his Highne&s;&s;e had din'd, immediatly tooke hor&s;e, his Highne&s;&s;e having received certaine intelligence, that both the general Feild-mari&s;halls with all their forces, &amp; provi&s;io~ were already marching upwards towards the river of Rhine, and therefore his High|ne&s;&s;e, lea&s;t they &s;hould pa&s;&s;e by and attaine to their end (the victualling of the City and Fort of Bry&s;|&s;ack)
<PB N="15" REF="8"> made the more ha&s;te to prevent them; and thereupon pre&s;ently after 12 of the clock at noone near the Village of Wittenweyer (where his High|ne&s;&s;e the la&s;t yeare had his &s;conce and Shipbridge) lighted upon the afore&s;aid Generalls, yet the &s;aid Generalls, having intelligence before of his comm|ing, had made them&s;elves ready in all things and therefore gotten the advantage of the ground to put their Army in battaile-aray, whereas on the other &s;ide it fell heavie and troble&s;ome to his High|ne&s;&s;e to march through a great wood and over a &s;mall Iland, moates and bridges, which were over|grown with thick hedges, which by the help of cer|taine 100 men of the Imperiall forces if not totally &s;topt, yet for a certaine time might much have hin|dred him, but being his Highne&s;&s;e found there no oppo&s;ition, hee put his Artillery and the troopes, which he had got over there, at the end of the a|fore&s;aid wood into Battaglia, and kept them clo&s;e together, till he had brought over all his forces and could give in a right order a full a&s;&s;ault: whereupon the &s;hooting with the Cannons was begun on both &s;ides and continued with great eagerne&s;&s;e, in&s;o|much that his Highne&s;&s;e right wing (which was lead by Generall Major <HI>Tupadell</HI>) becau&s;e the Im|periall and Bavarian right wing was &s;elected and con&s;i&s;ted of the choice&s;t of their forces, as namely of the curra&s;&s;iers and others of the be&s;t Regiments, was beaten back a great way, and forced to retire as farre as the re&s;erve, which was commanded by

<P>Now when it was come &s;o farre, that many of the Commanders wi&s;hed much joy to his Highne&s;&s;e of that glorious victory, Generall Major <HI>Tupadell</HI> was urged by his zeale and eagerne&s;&s;e to pur&s;ue with &s;ome &s;mall troops of his men after the fugitives; and when he had &s;ent his troops up and downe, here and there, and thought to returne backe againe with &s;ome few men thinking that no more of the Imperiall and Ba|varian troops were at hand: he was met unawares by an Imperiall troop, which had drawn together a|gaine, and thus was carried away pri&s;oner: and neere the very place of fight, five Imperiall &s;quadrons of hor&s;e, and foure of foot, lay yet on a certaine hill, and a very advantagious place, which made &s;hew, as if they would defend them&s;elves further; but as &s;oone
<PB N="19" REF="10"> as the maine body of the Wey-mari&s;h Army came neere unto them, and a blinde alarum was made, they retired immediatly in a great di&s;order, and fled to|wards Offenburg, where his Excellence Field-mar|&s;hall <HI>Goetz</HI> him&s;elfe &s;tayed not above halfe an houre, but with &s;ixe wagons loaden with baggage, which of all the re&s;t he had left behinde him there, retired yet the &s;ame night, together with General Major <HI>Sknetter,</HI> Colonell <HI>Geyling, Truekmuller,</HI> and <HI>Reynach</HI> towards <HI>Overkerk,</HI> into the narrow valley, where his Excel|lency cau&s;ed divers high Officers which were carried away from the place of fight either dead, or dyed by the way, to be buried: In the meane time the wayes and pa&s;&s;ages over the high mountaines, (called the <HI>Kniebis</HI>) which were &s;topped by cutting downe of trees, he cau&s;ed by the Country people to be opened, and the re&s;t of his and the Duke of <HI>Savellies</HI> troopes, as namely 1400 hor&s;e. and 900 foot, yet all in a great confu&s;ion, to march through the &s;aid pa&s;&s;ages into the Country of Wirtenberg, and immediately thereupon cau&s;ed the &s;aid wayes and pa&s;&s;ages to be digged up a|gaine, and to be &s;topped with cutting downe of trees, more then they were afore-time.
