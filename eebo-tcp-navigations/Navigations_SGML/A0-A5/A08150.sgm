<HEAD>NEWES FROM POLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_COncerning the greatne&s;&s;e of the Empire of <HI>Turky,</HI> and the warlike concu&s;&s;ions where|with they haue affrighted both <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> you may con&s;ider it thus in the generall, that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the author of their Religion and <HI>Alcaron,</HI> enioyned the race of <HI>Othoman</HI> to two &s;peciall things. Fir&s;t, The one was the propagation of the Empire by &s;ome memorable attempt of war. Secondly, The other, the glorification of their Reli|gion, by &s;ome remarkeable action of peace, or &s;tu|pendous &s;tructure of amazement.</P>
<P>Touching the fir&s;t; It is too apparant, that their territories extend to the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Africane</HI> &s;hores, from <HI>Trebizond,</HI> in the bottome of the blacke Sea, to <HI>Argier,</HI> neighbouring the Straites of <HI>Gibralter,</HI> very neere &s;ixe thou&s;and Engli&s;h miles, be&s;ide the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Greece,</HI> and her Ilands, with his intru&s;ion into <HI>Hungarie,</HI> and dilacerating the peace of many Nations: They haue likewi&s;e as an
<PB REF="3"> auxiliary friend, the great <HI>Tartar Chrim,</HI> from whole Ance&s;tors <HI>Tamberlaine</HI> proceeded, who though him&s;elfe proued a great enemy to <HI>Turkes,</HI> yet doth <HI>Tartar Chrim</HI> boa&s;t of affinity to the fir&s;t <HI>Scythian Othoman,</HI> &s;o that if his direct line &s;hould faile, he challengeth the proximity of Succe&s;&s;ion, and inioying the pro&s;perity of the&s;e large Terri|tories of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> for which purpo&s;e hee keepeth corre&s;pondency with the <HI>Turke,</HI> and at his appoyntment &s;endeth 100000. <HI>Tartars</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his enterpri&s;es, whereby the <HI>Turkes</HI> haue many times great multitudes of men, and good &s;ucce&s;&s;e in their attempts: For they haue preuailed both again&s;t <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at this houre the Metropolitan City of <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia, Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and are indeed tran&s;ported with an in&s;ulting brauery, that they are a people de&s;igned of God, to bee the principall Nation of the earth, and a &s;courge to whip the &s;inners of the world.</P>
<P>Touching the glorification of their Religion; who knowes not, that either hath been conuer|&s;ant in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or would be conuer&s;ant with the &s;tories of former times, that the <HI>Almora|ta, Solimanna, Sophia,</HI> and diuers other <HI>Mo&s;ques,</HI> be not onely oftentous edifices and Churches of ad|miration, but workes of charity, and ob&s;eruant ho|line&s;&s;e: yea, as we call it, money laid out <HI>ad pios v|&s;us?</HI> I &s;peake not of <HI>Iobs</HI> Tombe, nor many other &s;e|que&s;tred places, wherein the&s;e Princes, to demon|&s;trate their opinion of a Deity, and care to main|taine
<PB REF="3"> <HI>Mahumetan</HI> con&s;titutions, imployed their time, and wealth, &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly conceiting &s;ome merit in their obedience; and that the ioyes of Paradi&s;e &s;hould be augmented, as they augmented their piety on earth: nay, you &s;hall reade in that wonderfull hi&s;tory of <HI>Soliman</HI> the Magnificent; and the faire, though dangerous <HI>Roxalana,</HI> that &s;he contriued her manumi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o obtained to be <HI>Empre&s;&s;e,</HI> vnder a di&s;&s;imuled &s;anctity, and holy ad|diction to the building of a Church in honour of the <HI>Prophet, and glory</HI> of Religion. In a word, you &s;hall find, that by this occa&s;ion, the principall <HI>Muf|ty,</HI> with the Doctors of the Law, haue more acce&s;&s;e to the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and open a larger heart of &s;ecrets, then either <HI>Viceer,</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;haw.</HI> Yea the <HI>Emperour,</HI> be he neuer &s;o warlike, or vicious, &s;tandeth more in awe of their prohibitions, then the reuolts or mu|tinies of the tumultuary <HI>Iani&s;aries,</HI> by whom a|lone, as you reade of <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Atlas</HI> &s;upporting the heauens, this great frame of <HI>Monarchy</HI> is vp|held, and kept &s;ecure, from any daring hands to di&s;-ioynt the &s;ame: and thus in generall.</P>
<P>But if you would more particularly be acquain|ted with the motiues, and actiue terrifying the Kingdome of <HI>Poland,</HI> and other confederate Chri|&s;tian Prouinces, wee mu&s;t needs fetch the &s;tory a little from the beginning, and &s;o draw it downe to the&s;e moderne times, wherein the braue <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> and the hopefull Prince his Sonne, haue prooued the &s;onnes of <HI>Mars,</HI> and regi&s;tred their renownes vpon the record of honour, and filled vp the tally
<PB REF="4"> of exployts with their vvorthine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Know then, that vvhile Sir <HI>Thomas Glouer</HI> was his Maie&s;ties of <HI>Englands</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI> there was re&s;ident in his hou&s;e, one <HI>Ga&s;paro Gratiano,</HI> in the nature of a <HI>Drogaman,</HI> who was of <HI>Austria,</HI> and &s;o a Subiect to <HI>Rodulphus,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> but at la&s;t a &s;eruant to the Prince of <HI>Mol|dauia:</HI> that Prince, I meane, that came into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and had gracious intertainement with the King and his Nobles: that Prince, vvho vvas di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his inheritance through the povver of Competitors: that Prince, vvho&s;e Mother I haue &s;eene poorely &s;olliciting the Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Constantinople</HI> for reliefe: that Prince, vvho vvas vvith the &s;ame <HI>Ga&s;paro</HI> impri&s;oned in the &s;euen Towers, for complayning of the Viceer, who tooke part vvith his Competitor: that Prince, vvho yet e&s;caped, and vvas faine to flee for &s;uccour to all the Princes of <HI>Europe:</HI> that Prince, vvho returned from <HI>England</HI> vvith &s;ufficient revvard, and credit for ten thou&s;and Dollers among our Marchants. In a word, that Prince, vvho couertly came from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and &s;o engaged Sir <HI>Thomas Glouer,</HI> that hee had rea&s;on to complaine of the Viceers oppo&s;ition, and the neglect of his ovvne fortune. For as it &s;hould &s;eeme, he had taken vp &s;o much money to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, that he almo&s;t lo&s;t him|&s;elfe, and made a great vertue vmbragious vvith the malignity of time.</P>
<P>Yet doth that Prince aduenture to <HI>Moldauia,</HI> determining to re-integrate his fortune, by rai&s;ing
<PB REF="4"> of factions. But it &s;hould &s;eeme &s;till <HI>Neme&s;is in Tergo.</HI> For his aduer&s;aries vvere &s;o &s;trengthened by the <HI>Viceers</HI> fauour at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that there vvent out a &s;trange Edict from the <HI>Grand &s;ignieur,</HI> both to haue a ce&s;&s;ation of the vvarre, and to e|&s;tabli&s;h the V&s;urper in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus fled the Prince once againe into <HI>Poland,</HI> and vvas pro|mi&s;ed reliefe, yea, &s;o forvvard in returning home, that &s;ome companies of foote, and troopes of Hor&s;e vvere ready to march in his behalfe.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things vvere thus acted on the &s;tage of variety in <HI>Moldauia, Signieur Ga&s;paro Gra|tiano</HI> imployed in <HI>Venice</HI> by Sir <HI>Thomas Glouer,</HI> re|turnes to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> but finding that the Em|ba&s;&s;adors fortunes vvere, as it were ob&s;cured with &s;ome cloud of di&s;turbance, he went another way to worke to winde vp the pullies of his owne ad|uancement, either by force, or policy, in which re|&s;olution all things were &s;o au&s;picious vnto him, that he was &s;uddenly &s;ent vvith letters to the Em|peror of <HI>Germany</HI> from the <HI>Grand &s;ignieur,</HI> which was &s;omewhat wondred at in re&s;pect of his mean|ne&s;&s;e and former &s;eruile imployment, till it was publikely knowne that his owne brother was a <HI>Re|negado Chaw&s;e,</HI> and in good account with the <HI>Viceer,</HI> yea, one of his &s;i&s;ters (as he told me him|&s;elfe) was taken pri&s;oner comming as a Pilgrime to <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> and &s;o brought to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> but whether re&s;erued for the <HI>Turkes</HI> v&s;e, or &s;ome <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> he could not tell.</P>
<P>In the meane while, Sir <HI>Thomas Glouer</HI> is recal|led
<PB REF="5"> into <HI>England,</HI> and Ma&s;ter <HI>Paul Pindar,</HI> who had been Con&s;ull at <HI>Petra&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Aleppo,</HI> as many yeeres commorant in tho&s;e parts, was confirmed his Maie&s;ties Emba&s;&s;adour in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in who&s;e time the former <HI>Ga&s;paro Gratiano</HI> returnes a|gaine to the great Citty, and was imployed into <HI>Moldauia</HI> by the Viceer, either as an ouer&s;eer of the actions of that Prouince, or as a new aduer&s;ary to the vnfortunate Prince his Ma&s;ter, who at la&s;t was there mi&s;chieuou&s;ly poy&s;oned among&s;t them, or as &s;ome will haue it, ab&s;olute gouernour, till the true titles might appeare, and the controuer&s;ies be determined.</P>
<P>How he behaued him&s;elfe, I will not di&s;pute, not con&s;tantly maintaine, that he dealt treacherou&s;ly with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> certifying vnder hand, that contrary to the peace contracted with the <HI>Grand &s;ignieur,</HI> he &s;upported the pirats of the black Sea, and the inhabitants of <HI>Bugdonia,</HI> the inte&s;tine broyles of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> the incur&s;ions of many <HI>Co&s;|&s;acks,</HI> whereby the <HI>Turke</HI> was then much exa&s;pera|ted again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> and a manife&s;t cloud of mi&s;|chiefe hung ouer all tho&s;e Countries apparantly. But this I am &s;ure of, that his Maie&s;ties Emba&s;&s;a|dor of <HI>Poland,</HI> Leigier at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> had neither &s;o gracious audience as he was wont, not &s;uch &s;e|curity as the priuiledges of Emba&s;&s;adors pre&s;umed on. For pre&s;ently the <HI>Grand &s;ignieur</HI> exclaymed a|gain&s;t them all in fury and di&s;plea&s;ure, and when there was forcible intimation indeed concerning the bu&s;ines of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> and the many claymes to
<PB REF="5"> the Principality by factious Lords, he not onely gaue commaundement to ouer-runne that Coun|trey, but to teach <HI>Poland</HI> it &s;elfe a new le&s;&s;on of o|bedience, y^t dur&s;t be auxiliary to a petty Prouince, again&s;t &s;o mighty a Monarke and greate&s;t Prince in the world: nor ended it thus in a kinde of &s;len|der inuectiue, but the threatnings had tearmes of o&s;tentation, be&s;ides the exprobrating their perfi|diou&s;ne&s;&s;e, yea, the letters had wonderfull titles, and far-fetcht denominations, the Emba&s;&s;ies, mix|ture of profanene&s;&s;e, and pre&s;umption of ouer-run|ning <HI>Europe;</HI> and all this was done in the life of <HI>Achmate,</HI> though for the time the whole frame of this conceiued di&s;plea&s;ure proued a Babyloni&s;h Tovver, and ended onely in confu&s;ion of Langua|ges: For as yet more then the cu&s;tomary breaking out of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> of <HI>Bogdonia,</HI> and the territories about the blacke Sea, there vvas no mayne Army on foote, but onely certaine preparatiues to a fol|lovving warre. For as if hee would leaue his rage hereditary, he commanded the principall <HI>Mufti</HI> and Doctors of the Law to remember this charge to his Sonne, and put him in minde of the pro&s;e|cution: which accordingly vvith filiall obedience he performed indeed, and brought out the furies of his vengeance to act that part, which they haue now played in tho&s;e Countries. But becau&s;e many remarkeable things happened in the death of <HI>Ach|mate,</HI> before this young <HI>Phaeton</HI> came to guide and manage the Hor&s;es of this Monarchies Chariot, giue mee leaue to in&s;i&s;t a little vpon them, and
<PB REF="6"> modell out this relation to &s;ome forme of plea&s;ure and contentment.</P>
<P><HI>Achmate</HI> comming to the Empire at 15. yeeres old, remained in the &s;ame, till he was almo&s;t thirty, in which time plea&s;ure &s;urfetted on ea&s;e, and ea&s;e had &s;uch changes of wantonne&s;&s;e, that hee &s;eemed weary with the continuance of delight: for <HI>Sarda|napalus</HI> came &s;hort of him for abunda~ce of Concu|bines, and variety of luxurie: &s;o that if it bee true, that <HI>Voluptates commendat rarior v&s;us,</HI> it mu&s;t needs follow, that to play thus continually, proued as te|dious to him as to worke; and to gurmandize thus without ce&s;&s;ation, mu&s;t needs rai&s;e rather a loth|&s;omene&s;&s;e then &s;atisfaction. In briefe, he had &s;o ma|ny wiues &amp; children, that, in a maner, he forgot the the glory of his Family, &amp; the pro&s;ecution of glori|ous enterpri&s;es, giuing him&s;elfe ouer to the <HI>Syrens</HI> incantation of <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> and la&s;ciuiou&s;ne&s;&s;e: in the heate of which outrage, he determined to kill his brother <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> a Prince of great expectation, whom, as yet, &s;ome &s;upernaturall prouidence had pre&s;erued from death: But now to colour his pretences, &s;uch was the law, &s;uch was the cu&s;tome, nay, &s;uch was the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;eruation, that as Nature teacheth all creatures the way of &s;ecurity; &s;o had Policy in|&s;tructed the&s;e Princes by this one <HI>Machiauelia~</HI> trick to preuent mi&s;chiefes, in&s;urrections, factions, com|petitions, murthers, and all &s;uch affrightings that make Princes vnhappy, if they be once put in feare indeed. This made <HI>Damocles</HI> that he could eate no meate, when hee &s;aw the &s;word ready to fall vpon
<PB REF="6"> him, that hung ouer his head by a hor&s;e haire. This made the Emperour tell his flatterer, that if he knew what cares were the Companions of his Crowne, he would not take it vp, though it lay in his way as a donation of Fortune. This made <HI>Dio|ny&s;ius</HI> tru&s;t none but his daughter, to burne off his haire with nut&s;hels: and this made <HI>Achmate</HI> to con|tinue the cu&s;tome of his <HI>Progenitors,</HI> by remouing all the cau&s;es of terrour and &s;u&s;pition, though the life of his brethren payed for it.</P>
<P>But what &s;ayes the Poet? <HI>Multa cadunt inter ca|licem &s;uprem&aacute;que labra.</HI> So as this iolly Prince was running away with the apprehen&s;ion of his happi|ne&s;&s;e, &s;etting downe a determinate houre for the &s;trangling of Prince <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> his brother, the night before the period of his <HI>Cata&s;trophe,</HI> a fearfull Vi&s;ion diuerted him from the enterpri&s;e, and a fear|full voyce ecchoed in his eares, that there could bee no Religion in murther; and tho&s;e &s;acrifices which the Tyrants made in former times, of blood and humane fle&s;h, were the cau&s;es of the ruine and de|ua&s;tation of their Monarchies; yea, vtter lo&s;&s;e of body and &s;oule to the Princes them&s;elues.</P>
<P>Little thought the great <HI>Turke</HI> to haue found a greater Greatne&s;&s;e in his &s;leepe, and le&s;&s;e did hee &s;u&s;pect that there was &s;uch a God aboue to coun|termand the gods on the earth. But &s;o predomi|nant was his ouer-ruling <HI>Genius</HI> at this time, and &s;o tractable his obedience, that the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ext day hee &s;ent for the principall <HI>Mufty,</HI> &s;ome Doctors of the Law, and <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw,</HI> who was delegated <HI>Gene|rall</HI><PB REF="7"> again&s;t the <HI>Polonians:</HI> To whom hee imparted the apparition, and of whom hee receiued &s;ome|thing &s;ortable to the flattering of Princes; but al|together vn&s;ea&s;onable, becau&s;e his &s;oule was touch|ed with &s;ome rough hands, &amp; he wi&s;ely con&s;idered there was more to bee looked after, then a pre&s;ent greatne&s;&s;e, or flouri&s;hing tyranny: whereupon e|uen in their pre&s;ence he &s;ends for his brother, di&s;|chargeth his <HI>Mutes,</HI> who were the officers of death, alloweth him a Gard of <HI>Capogies,</HI> appoynteth him a <HI>Caska,</HI> or Banqueting-hou&s;e by him&s;elfe, and at la&s;t preuaileth thus with his owne great heart, that he venteth out the&s;e &s;peeches:</P>
<P>Brother, ari&s;e, (for you mu&s;t know, that all men comming to tractate with the Emperour, v&s;e a kind of &s;laui&s;h pro&s;titution, till, out of his free Princeline&s;&s;e, he grace them with a new fauour.) You are not, I am &s;ure, ignorant of this &s;ecret of State, this law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> this policy of gouern|ment, this meanes of our &s;ecurity, that when wee haue children of our owne, no brothers mu&s;t liue to di&s;quiet them, nor any blockes bee ca&s;t in their way to the race of Soueraignty, which may either &s;tartle vs in our re&s;olutions, or bee vmbragious to their tenderne&s;&s;e by any attempt, or &s;u&s;pition of trea&s;on: therefore was I re&s;olued to wrap you vp into the Cypre&s;&s;e che&s;ts of your predece&s;&s;ors; not &s;o much in imitation of cu&s;tome, to which in a manner our fathers chained their liues and actions, as confirmation of my owne iudgement, not to commit &s;uch a <HI>&s;olleci&s;me</HI> in my Soueraignty, as to
<PB REF="7"> leaue a hand vncut off, which might, by way of audaciou&s;ne&s;&s;e, ca&s;t defiance in the face of an Em|perour, or &s;ow the &s;eeds of turbulency, to choke vp the good corne of peace and quietne&s;&s;e: but &s;ure, thou ha&s;t found &s;ome friend, whom none can finde, but by the purity of life, and deuotion of prayer: he hath told me in thy behalfe, There is no Religi|on in blood. For as that &s;tone-building cannot &s;tand, which is &s;et vp with vntempered morter: &s;o cannot their liues pro&s;per, who carow&s;e the receits that are mingled with death, or reuenge.</P>
<P>Therefore liue, nay therefore raigne, and when the thred of my life is &s;pun, which is now a win|ding on the wheele of De&s;tiny, looke you &s;tep in|to the chaire of controll. Remember the <HI>Othoman</HI> glory, and let my abhorred cour&s;e of life be a war|ning vnto thee, that &s;urquedry and effeminatene&s;&s;e be the onely clogs to a generous minde, and barre vp the gates euen in the in&s;ide, to keepe Princes out of the Palace of Honour and renowne. Re|member, that though Monarkes would liue with|out controll; yet there are no &s;uch enemies to the flouri&s;hings of Gouernment, as to &s;port before them with the tripping <HI>Faeries</HI> of flattery, and pri|uate re&s;pect, vvhereby they &s;hall either looke vvith ouer-big countenances, or &s;peake vvith ouer-big voyces to the &s;ubiect, or el&s;e giue vvay to &s;uch by-vvayes of authority, that if they may bee brought backe to looke vvheron they haue trod, they vvould &s;top their no&s;es at the filthy ordure of mud and ovv&s;e, vvhen yet they might haue gone in the
<PB REF="8"> &s;mooth and &s;weete tract of a more plea&s;ant and &s;afer walke. Remember my children, that are Prin|ces by blood, and &s;hould haue beene thy Ma&s;ters by birth-right: but they are too young to rule them&s;elues, and too great to bee ouer-ruled by o|thers: nay, the <HI>Othoman</HI> glory mu&s;t not be &s;hared among&s;t a troope of dependants, nor the Chariot wheeles of our Maie&s;ty be da&s;hed with the daring approches of &s;uch hor&s;es, as mu&s;t needs be dirty vs more then our owne flingings or wantonne&s;&s;e. Re|member thy &s;elfe, that art, as it were pulled out of the iawes of death; and if it be a benefit to liue, or a ble&s;&s;ing to liue gloriou&s;ly, let it be thy vertue to be thankfull, and my good Fortune, that I impar|ted this benefit to &s;o worthy a man. To conclude, remember our God, and let not policy, like <HI>Prome|theus</HI> his Vulture, gnaw vpon the heart of religion; but when thou &s;ee&s;t any &s;tart a&s;ide from hone&s;t o|bedience, be &s;ure he is either an hypocrite, or facti|ous. Keepe thy &s;elfe therefore as clo&s;e to purity as thou can&s;t, and neither neglect publike meetings, nor priuate &s;eque&s;tration, but take heed of &s;eruing of God for priuate re&s;pects: For that God which doth giue vs bread, will giue vs &s;tones, and turne our heauen into bra&s;&s;e, and earth into iron, if wee doe not &s;erue him for loue, and come to him with cheerfulne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>When he had made an end, hee &s;ent for the o|ther <HI>Viceers</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;hawes,</HI> and adiured them to the ratification of his will: &s;o his brother was di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed to his Palace de&s;igned, and they di&s;charged till
<PB REF="8"> they were recalled: but hee neuer troubled them more: for very &s;hortly after, he yeelded to the &s;um|mons of the great Commander of Princes, and gaue way to the alteration that followed in the State, yet for the time, with one generall con&s;ent and vnanimity they inue&s;ted the Princely <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha</HI> with the Diadem, in which he remained qui|etly a while, as if they made a con&s;cience of in|fringing the will of the dead, and were re&s;olued to admit of his vertue, that mu&s;t needs adde glory to the Empire.</P>
<P>But <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw</HI> perceiuing his owne autho|rity much dimini&s;hed by this tran&s;lation, and pro|iecting another manner of greatne&s;&s;e, if hee might be aduanced to be <HI>Viceer</HI> vnder a younger Prince, intimated again&s;t the new Emperour, that hee was too much addicted to peace and &s;obriety, and his coole &s;pirit mu&s;t needs draw on &s;trange inconue|niences vpon the Empire; but in truth, he watched all opportunity to conuer&s;e with the children of <HI>Achmate,</HI> and found the liuely <HI>O&s;man,</HI> or <HI>Othoman,</HI> being eight or nine yeeres old, &s;o forward, and &s;prightfull, that he dur&s;t aske him, to his amaze, if he were not his fathers elde&s;t &s;onne: yea, he inter|iected &s;uch &s;trange que&s;tions and demands, that the <HI>Ba&s;hawes</HI> were already afraid they had done &s;omething vniu&s;tifiable, and which mu&s;t be an&s;we|red with no le&s;&s;e then the lo&s;&s;e of their liues.</P>
<P>Whereupon he re&s;olued on an alteration, and &s;o conferred with the <HI>Viceer</HI> and principall <HI>Mufty,</HI> about the towardline&s;&s;e of the young Prince, and
<PB REF="9"> &s;aw no remedy for their &s;ecurity, but to depo&s;e <HI>Mu|&s;tapha</HI> againe, &amp; make <HI>O&s;man</HI> Emperour: to which, when none of that Councell and faction dur&s;t op|po&s;e, they pre&s;ently gaue the <HI>Iani&s;aries</HI> a donatiue in the name of young <HI>O&s;man,</HI> &s;tored the <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> with many Gallies, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed certaine <HI>Tartarians,</HI> which were to goe into <HI>Bogdonia,</HI> and were not to be tolerated till the tumult was appea&s;ed, &s;ent for diuers <HI>San&s;acks</HI> and <HI>Timatriots</HI> to attend the young Emperour, and vnder hand filled the great City with &s;ouldiers, ere <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> could coniecture that they intended &s;o waighty a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, as the depo|&s;ing of a Prince.</P>
<P>But when all things were ready, and all men pre|pared, that were acquainted with the con&s;piracy, <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw</HI> brought out the young <HI>O&s;man</HI> in publike; who&s;e manly countenance, and Princely towardline&s;&s;e amazed them more, then if they had &s;eene &s;ome Meteor or portentous Comet: What &s;hould I in&s;i&s;t on circum&s;tances? By a wonderfull applau&s;e they gaue him notice of their liking, and a quicke di&s;patch of his inue&s;ture a&s;&s;urance of their approbation: &s;o they made no more adoe, but pro|claimed him Emperour, and allowed him all his prerogatiues, as if hee had beene of mature iudge|ment to challenge their pro&s;titution indeed. The next worke was the impri&s;oning of his Vnkle, or, if you will, &s;eque&s;tring him into the former Palace where his brother appoynted him to remaine be|fore his death, with a Gard of <HI>Capogies.</HI> Here he was confined, well attended, and better ob&s;erued: For
<PB REF="9"> &s;uch was his Fortune, that then <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw</HI> ex|cu&s;ed his depo&s;ure from the nece&s;&s;ity of their owne pre&s;eruation, and feare of the tumultuary <HI>Iani&s;aries,</HI> who &s;till cryed after the &s;onne of <HI>Achmate,</HI> and euer after (as it &s;till continues) the <HI>Viceers</HI> deale in no cau&s;e without his priuity and aduice; in &s;o much, that when the ambitious <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> propo&s;ed the war again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> as a continuation of &s;ome glorious action for the honour of the <HI>Othoman</HI> Family, and renouation of <HI>Achmates</HI> charge to his &s;onne in re|uenge of their darings to defend <HI>Moldauia:</HI> hee in|terceded, vrging, The former contract was not de|termined betweene the Emperour <HI>Mathias,</HI> or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and his brother, and that the Prin|ces of <HI>Europe</HI> were more war-like, and better pro|uided then in times pa&s;t: to which againe <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw</HI> replied, as much incen&s;ed again&s;t the <HI>Polo|nians,</HI> that there were many rea&s;ons to moue the warre, and inferences of inforcement to &s;et forward the enterprize.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the fle&s;hing (as it were) of the young Em|peror with noble beginnings in a plentifull Coun|try, and delight&s;ome fields, where there would bee neither <HI>Anachims</HI> nor Giants to terrifie them, nor a&s;perity of weather or wants to exanimate the &s;oul|dier. Secondly, the Countrey con&s;orted to their military manner of fighting, as being a kinde of Champion and vberant &s;oyle, whereby their Ar|chers might haue the more roome, and their car|riages ea&s;ine&s;&s;e of trauell. Thirdly, it would keepe other Princes in awe, from a&s;&s;uming a liberty to of|fend
<PB REF="10"> their great Lord, or pre&s;uming that any po|wer on earth &s;hould be able to with&s;tand the <HI>Ma|humetane</HI> Army. Fourthly, if Princes did not re|uenge exa&s;perating wrongs, they would bee vili|pended and quickly made a &s;corne to inferiours. Fifthly, opportunity was not to be dallied withall, according to the &s;aying of <HI>Fronte capillata p&ograve;&s;t e&s;t oc|ca&s;io calua:</HI> and now the Emperours of <HI>Germany, Rodolphus</HI> and <HI>Mathias</HI> being dead, the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> would repine again&s;t the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and bandy them&s;elues to &s;et the peace of <HI>Europe</HI> in combu&s;tion. La&s;t of all, their owne Empire began to grow populous, and the Prouinces had need of exonerating their people, or el&s;e &s;ome plague and dearth would deuoure them, without further good or profit to the Common-wealth, then choking the ayre with the &s;tench of their carca&s;&s;es, or &s;poy|ling one another with thefts and robberies.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e the noble <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> punctually an|&s;wered: Fir&s;t, concerning the leading the Emperor to the martiall Theater, hee being &s;o young, and not apprehen&s;iue either of glory, or reuenge; it would be imputed to the priuate humour or coue|tou&s;ne&s;&s;e of &s;ome priuate men. As for &s;ecurity in the vvarre, opinion might bee deceiued, and pre|&s;umption abu&s;ed: for the <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Pole</HI> vvere as good hor&s;e as them&s;elues: and though they had not &s;uch numbers, yet were they better furni&s;hed &amp; ap|poynted; and though there vvere not &s;o many &s;trong Cities to batter or &s;urprize, yet had they learned the cunning of trenches, with the v&s;e of
<PB REF="10"> great Ordnance and fortification, yea, they knew the di&s;cipline of a Campe, and the effect of &s;trata|gems. Secondly, concerning the commodiou&s;|ne&s;&s;e of the Countrey, to their Military di&s;cipline, what &s;hould arrowes doe again&s;t &s;trong Cor&s;lets, and Targets of defence? Be&s;ides, they had Har|quebuze on Hor&s;ebacke, as well as them&s;elues, and what they wanted in number, was &s;upplied with di&s;cipline and armour: as for the valour of our na|tion, and their obedience to their Commanders, who peraduenture were carele&s;&s;e to lo&s;e &s;uch whom they were willing to &s;pare, the times were altered, and nature had taught all creatures the lawe of pre&s;eruation. Thirdly, concerning the terrifying of other Princes, they would be decei|ued. For <HI>Rota fortuna in gyro,</HI> and the <HI>Turkes</HI> had not &s;ucce&s;&s;e in a &s;tring; nay, what Monarchy was euer &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, but came at la&s;t to a pe|riod, &s;ubiect in the &s;ame manner to diminution, as it began with augmentation? Not that I would extenuate the glory of our <HI>Iani&s;aries,</HI> but from mode&s;t coniecture of alteration, not to bee too confident of our greatne&s;&s;e: For by experience we haue found many interceptions both at <HI>Stri|gonium, Vienna,</HI> and <HI>Malta:</HI> wee lo&s;t the battaile of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> hazarded <HI>Tauris</HI> and other Cities to the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> were turmoyled with the rebels at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and at this houre are affronted by the Pyrats and robberies of the blacke Sea. Fourthly, concerning reuenges, whereunto the Empire was engaged for feare of being &s;lighted by others, it was que&s;tion|le&s;&s;e
<PB REF="11"> in many ca&s;es a worthy worke, and a tricke to de&s;erue as much as might be at Honours hands, but in this particular it was too too true, that from the yeere 1608. to 1620. many v&s;urpers had &s;tarted vp in <HI>Moldauia</HI> from the &s;upportation, I will not &s;ay corruption of the <HI>Viceers</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and therefore hee &s;aw no rea&s;on vpon &s;o &s;lender mo|tiues, as the relieuing of one another, either for re|ligion, or neighbourhood to rai&s;e &s;o great a warre again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> or breake the peace, which had been &s;o long continued, though the vnruly <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> &s;till remayne refractary, both again&s;t vs and their owne Lords. Fifthly, concerning the di&s;&s;entions of the <HI>Europian</HI> Princes, the mayne bu&s;ine&s;&s;e lay remote from them, and if there &s;hould be &s;uch occa&s;ion as the <HI>Triumuiri</HI> of <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> &s;erued the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the neighbour Princes would quickely vnite together again&s;t a publike enemy; nay, what know we, if our forces be this way gathered again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> whe|ther tho&s;e mighty Nauies of <HI>Europe</HI> would not mu|&s;ter them&s;elues and come into the <HI>Leuant,</HI> and then what could a few Gallies doe again&s;t &s;o many goodly Ships? La&s;t of all, concerning the lo&s;&s;e of men, what Prince could an&s;were for the &s;oules of his Subiects, except the cau&s;e were warrantable, and the warre allowable? Ambition was no plea in Paradi&s;e, nor Reuenge a iu&s;tifiable excu&s;e before their God. Againe, if in the oppo&s;ition they found as many men, and as much as enraged, what would then be the i&s;&s;ue and finall effect?</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> had co~cluded, al was mi&s;|con&s;tred,
<PB REF="11"> and imputed rather to pu&s;illanimity then courage, or the re&s;olution of an Heroicke &s;pirit: wherefore they re&s;olued to da&s;h out the&s;e incom|brances, and &s;uppre&s;&s;e his allegations from the knowledge of the Army, and indeed to take a cleane contrary cour&s;e, &s;o that by the con&s;ent of the <HI>Mufty,</HI> and the principall Doctors of the Law, the war was determined, &amp; <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw</HI> pro&s;tituted him&s;elfe before the young <HI>O&s;man</HI> with humble in|terce&s;&s;ion, that he would be reuenged: who pre&s;ent|ly bade him ri&s;e, and as if he thought it a pa&s;time, cried out, To the war: and that hee would in per|&s;on, though not twelue yeeres olde, goe into the field: whereupon the <HI>Tartars</HI> were &s;ent for, the Cammels prouided, the Artillery appoynted, the bridges prepared, the pioners mu&s;tered, the muni|tion &s;et out, the <HI>Iani&s;aries</HI> rewarded, and all things ordered to the be&s;t purpo&s;e, that might &s;et forward the enterprize, and belonged to &s;o great an Army, and formidable a preparation.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e I am willing to touch the prai&s;es of the <HI>Polonians,</HI> and in no &s;ort to obumbrate their glory, that haue de&s;erued &s;o well, not only for their valiant enterprizes, and &s;ucce&s;&s;efull victories, but for their religious care to retribute thanke&s;giuing to God, that hath giuen them &s;uch wonderfull meanes of preuayling: I will now tell you how o|thers tell the &s;tory, or adde as a &s;upplyment this, which is yet vntold. About the yeere 1609. one <HI>Stephen</HI> liuing with the <HI>Viceer</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> pre|tended a right to the Principate of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> and
<PB REF="12"> either by fauour or pre&s;ents, had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of 20000. <HI>Turkes,</HI> whereby he preuayled in the proiect: yet others impute the occa&s;ion of &s;ending the&s;e men to <HI>Mehemet Ba&s;haw,</HI> who fayling in gathering vp the taxes and tallages of the Countrey, &s;o in|cen&s;ed the <HI>Viceer,</HI> that he mu&s;tered a great Army again&s;t the Sonnes of the Prince of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> whom they barbarou&s;ly defeated and &s;lew with their Vnkle <HI>Simeon:</HI> and becau&s;e the Sonnes of <HI>Ie|remy</HI> were reputed Ba&s;tards, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> by a contract from the <HI>Turkes,</HI> had the naming of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or among&s;t them, who cho&s;e <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the younger Sonne to bee <HI>Vaiuod:</HI> which &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed <HI>Mehemet Ba&s;haw,</HI> who was de&s;igned to rectifie the di&s;orders of this Countrey, that by force of Armes he &s;poyled whom he li&s;t, and as it &s;hould &s;eeme, in de&s;pite of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> killed <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and &s;et vp one of his owne faction; which indignity not to be indured among&s;t Princes, cau&s;ed the <HI>Po|lonians</HI> &s;till to helpe and a&s;&s;i&s;t the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed peo|ple; &s;o that incited by the lawes of Chri&s;tianity and neighbourhood, be&s;ides tho&s;e high motiues of princeline&s;&s;e and royalty, they thought it merito|rious and a duty of renowne, and &s;o accordingly &s;upplied their wants, and tooke vp armes in their defence.</P>
<P>The&s;e warres and contentions la&s;ted till <HI>Sigi&s;|mond</HI> King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was cho&s;en King of <HI>Poland,</HI> a warlike Prince, and one that had many contenti|ons with the <HI>Mu&s;couites,</HI> and &s;ome Competitors of his owne Nation: but taking vpon him this gouern|ment,
<PB REF="12"> hee al&s;o tooke vpon him the protection of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> &s;o that as you haue heard, about the yeere 1618. the youthfull <HI>O&s;man,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Turks,</HI> by the in&s;tigation of <HI>Siander Ba&s;haw,</HI> and the <HI>Viceers,</HI> gaue order for the mu&s;tring vp of a won|derfull Army, con&s;i&s;ting of many <HI>Tartars,</HI> the onely enemy to the <HI>Europae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ns,</HI> to whom were vnited the Countreys of <HI>Dacia, Seruia, Bulgaria, Illyria, Thracia, Epyrus,</HI> and the tributary Prouinces of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> them&s;elues, who dur&s;t not gaine&s;ay the <HI>Turks</HI> offi|cers, for feare of &s;lauery, bondage, and ouer-run|ning their Countreys, vpon the lea&s;t drawing back or murmuring, to bee made in&s;truments of their brethrens blood.</P>
<P>In this manner was a warlike body compo&s;ed of 200000. who marched into the fields of <HI>Dacia</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> where the <HI>Polacks</HI> incountred them with &s;ome auxiliaries out of <HI>Ru&s;sia,</HI> and the borders of the blacke Sea, and although they came not neere them in numbers, yet God be thanked, they &s;urpa&s;|&s;ed them in valour, and noble performances: For to &s;peake without o&s;tentation, &s;uch was the fortune of the noble <HI>Sigi&s;mond,</HI> and the brauery of the yong Prince his &s;onne, that they neuer came to any forci|ble incounter, but the <HI>Polonians</HI> went away with a pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;&s;e, and further hope of preuailing: for which, they euer added thanke&s;giuing to God, and &s;olemne Proce&s;&s;ion for their victories: Yet you mu&s;t thinke, their fortune neuer grew to that height, of &s;uch numbers as is reported to be &s;laine on the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ide, but that they receiued reciprocall
<PB REF="13"> damages, and &s;aw &s;ome of their owne men made the &s;tuffings of graues, and the furniture of a &s;laughter-hou&s;e: onely this is certaine, that in the yeere 1620. they gaue the <HI>Tartars</HI> an ouerthrow, as they were tran&s;porting their men at the nether ri|uers to pa&s;&s;e into firmer ground, that their bodies &s;topped the &s;treame, and 20000. at lea&s;t were &s;laine at three &s;euerall incounters, which &s;o inraged the yong Emperour, that he &s;ware to goe in per&s;on in|to the field with all his forces, and then it may be, there might haue beene pulled on more fearefull ruines on the heads of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and their fields mu&s;t needes haue beene heaped vp with many &s;laughtered carka&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the God of mercy and compa&s;sion, one way tooke pitty of the&s;e innocents and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Soul|diers, and another way put a hooke in the no&s;e of this <HI>Leuiathan,</HI> or if you will, abated the &s;trength of <HI>Behemoth,</HI> and that by meere accident, as by the&s;e particulars may appeare: while the youthfull <HI>O&s;|man</HI> full of heate and rage, prepared to goe in per|&s;on into <HI>Bogdonia,</HI> and &s;o re&s;olued without inter|ception to pa&s;&s;e into <HI>Poland:</HI> the fir&s;t yeere he was intercepted by a plague in the Army, and &s;o they thought it vnmeet to hazard his per&s;on to &s;uch contagion and affrighting di&s;ea&s;es. The next yeere they will haue an earth-quake to be &s;o formidable at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that be&s;ide the &s;haking of the ground, ouerthrow of hou&s;es, and deua&s;tation of Churches; certaine fearefull &s;tormes terrified them more the~ the hand-writing, that knockt <HI>Bel&s;hazzars</HI>
<PB REF="13"> knees together. At another time, the Emperour hauing diuers <HI>Ba&s;hawes</HI> &s;onnes appoynted to at|tend him, would needs, in a wanton iollity, goe &s;port him&s;elfe in the <HI>Sacra porta</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> and out of his Gally threw wild-fire and &s;quibs among&s;t the &s;hips, which &s;ure would haue done much harme, but that the &s;ailors, acquainted with the &s;ame, by wetting their &s;ailes, and other deuices, preuented the mi&s;chiefe, offering no vio|lence vnto his owne Gally; yet did they returne &s;ome &s;tones and &s;quibs into the re&s;t: but pa&s;&s;ing by a lime-boat, who&s;e &s;moke hindred them from de&s;crying, or di&s;couering the Emperor, they threw their hot &s;tones among&s;t the Gallies, whereof one hit him full on the bre&s;t to his ouer-turning, as hee was laughing at the tacklings &s;et on fire, and the poore &s;laues &s;tripping them&s;elues for feare of bur|ning. Another time as he was riding on hawking, he receiued &s;o &s;ore a fall, that the blood gu&s;hed out of his no&s;e, and the company were amazed at his carele&s;ne&s;&s;e. Another time &s;porting him&s;elfe in the pa&s;&s;age to the blacke &s;ea, where the riuer (as I call it) is a narrow &s;treame of 20. miles in length, be&s;et on each &s;ide of the banke with <HI>Ba&s;hawes</HI> hou|&s;es, like the pretty fabricks betweene <HI>Padoa</HI> and <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> he would needs attempt to throw a hand&s;ome &s;tripling ouer-boord, which he did with that vio|lence, that hee had like to haue followed him into the water, had not the Steers-man left the helme, and tooke hold of his crim&s;on &s;atten skirts, and &s;o &s;tayed him; yet his Turband fell into the water,
<PB REF="14"> and the youth &s;wamme to another Galley.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;ome other detained him a while from his fir&s;t &s;peedine&s;&s;e of going in per&s;on into the field, or augmenting his army to &s;uch a greatnes, as was euer allowed to the pre&s;ence of an Emperor. But neither the&s;e, nor any thing el&s;e could coole the heat of his fury and di&s;plea&s;ure, but that hee mu&s;t needs &s;end both defiance, and threatning into <HI>Poland,</HI> that though his reuenges were procra&s;ti|nated by diuers occa&s;ions, yet would he come vp|on them like a whirle-wind, and take a backward race, to runne the more &s;peedily forward: nor was this me&s;&s;age performed &s;portiuely, as a cu&s;tome of vnkindne&s;&s;e and ill conceiued di&s;plea&s;ure between Princes, but with prote&s;tation and vowes, inuoca|cation to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and fearefull execration and othes to doe &s;omething memorable for the glory of the <HI>Othoman</HI> Family: whereupon, as an intro|duction to a more and greater mi&s;chiefe, hee &s;ent <HI>Scander Ba&s;haw</HI> before, with a new army into <HI>Bog|donia</HI> of 200000. <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> perceiued it would be wor&s;e and wor&s;e, con&s;idering they re&s;olued to be reuen|ged for their former lo&s;&s;es, hee acquainted all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> with the perill he &s;tood in, recal|led &s;ome of his <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> out of <HI>Hungary,</HI> placed them in the borders of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> fortified the fron|tiers, and &s;topped the pa&s;&s;ages with new <HI>Ramparts</HI> and <HI>Barricados.</HI> Thus was an Emba&s;&s;adour &s;ent to <HI>Vienna</HI> to the Emperour, by way of interce&s;&s;ion of a peace, or truce betweene <HI>Bethlehem Gabor,</HI> and his
