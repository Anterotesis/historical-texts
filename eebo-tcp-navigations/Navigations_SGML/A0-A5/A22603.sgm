<HEAD TYPE="sub">&leaf; A Proclamation touching the Corporation of Bever-makers of London, and to re&s;train the Import|ing of forrain Hats, and the wearing of Demy-ca&s;ters within his Maje&s;ties Dominions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_WHereas, notwith&s;tanding the Princely care of Our late dear and</HI> Royall Father King <HI>JAMES</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed memory, for the nece&s;&s;ary maintenance and pre&s;ervation of the Manufacture of Hats and Caps within this Kingdome, in prohibiting by &s;everall Procla|mations the Importation into the &s;ame from forrain parts, of any Hats or Caps what&s;oever, either wrought or half wrought, upon pain of the forfeiture of the &s;ame; We now finde that abundance of Hats and Caps, a&s;well of Bever-&s;tuffe, or Bever-wooll, as of other Wooll and materialls made &amp; wrought in forrain parts, are frequently imported into this our Kingdome, to the great impoveri&s;hment and depriving of multitudes of Our poor &s;ubjects of their livelihood and imployment.</P>
<P>Wee tendring the common good of our &s;aid &s;ubjects, and that for the time to come they may be enabled to live, and maintain them&s;elves and families, by their hone&s;t labours in their &s;aid trades; And that the Art and My&s;terie of making or working of Hats and Caps of Bever-&s;tuffe or Bever-wooll within Our &s;aid Kingdome, may be regulated in a ju&s;t and orderly way, without the deceits and abu&s;es now practi&s;ed in the &s;ame, (the wearing of Bever-Hats being of late times become much in u&s;e, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e of &s;ort and qua|lity) Have thought fit to incorporate &s;undry per&s;ons Free-men of London, expert in the art of making or working Hats and Caps of Bever-&s;tuffe or Bever-wooll, who accord|ingly are to govern the &s;aid trade, and may be an&s;werable to Vs for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And therefore Wee do &s;traightly charge and command all per&s;on and per&s;ons what&s;oever, a&s;well Our naturall born &s;ubjects, as denizens or &s;trangers, That they or any of them directly or indirectly, do not from henceforth at any time or times hereafter, import, convey, or bring, or cau&s;e to be imported, conveyed, or brought into Our Realm of England or Domi|nion
<PB N="2" REF="2">of Wales, any Hats or Caps of Bever, or other Hats or Caps, of what condition or &s;ort &s;oever, made, wrought or half wrought, or hereafter to be made, wrought or half wrought, in any parts beyond the Seas, to be &s;old or put to &s;ale here. And that no per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;oever, after the twelfth day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> next coming, &s;hall &s;ell or put to &s;ale, or &s;hall have in their hou&s;es or &s;hops, to &s;ell or put to &s;ale, any of the &s;aid forrain Hats, or Caps, already imported into this Our Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, upon pain of the lo&s;&s;e and forfeiture of the &s;ame, and &s;uch further puni&s;hment as &s;hall be meet for &s;uch their contempt, the one half of which forfeitures to be to the u&s;e of Vs, Our Heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ours, and the other half of the &s;aid Bever-hats or Hats mixt with Bever &s;o to be imported, to be to the u&s;e of the &s;aid Bever-makers and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and the moity of all other Felts &s;o to be imported, to be to the u&s;e of the Company of Felt-makers of <HI>London,</HI> and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>And to the end that the &s;aid Corporation of Bever-makers, Our naturall born Subjects, may be con&s;tantly imployed in their &s;aid Trade, We do hereby &s;traightly charge and command, that no per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;oever within Our &s;aid Realme of <HI>England,</HI> or Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> at any time or times hereafter, do pre&s;ume to u&s;e or execi&s;e the Trade or My&s;tery of making or working of Hats or Caps of Bever-&s;tuffe or Bever-wooll, to be &s;old or put to &s;ale, unle&s;&s;e &s;uch per&s;ons have commonly u&s;ed the &s;aid Trade by the &s;pace of two yeers la&s;t pa&s;t, or have &s;erved an Apprenti&s;hip to the &s;ame by the &s;pace of &s;even yeers: And that no per&s;on or per|&s;ons what&s;oever, for the time to come, &s;hall u&s;e or practi&s;e the &s;aid Trade, unle&s;&s;e he or they have been or &s;hall be fir&s;t bound and brought up as Apprentice or Apprentices in the &s;ame Trade by the &s;pace of &s;even yeers at the lea&s;t, and are or &s;hall be members of the &s;aid Corpora|tion, upon pain of Our high di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;uch puni&s;hments as &s;hall be meet for the of|fenders herein, for &s;uch their contempts of Our Royall commands, and the lo&s;&s;e and for|feiture of all &s;uch Bever-hats and Caps as &s;hall be &s;o made, to be &s;eized to Our u&s;e, the one moitie to be to Vs, Our Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ours; and the other moitie to be to the Company of Bever-makers and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ours. And we do hereby declare, that there is no Intention by the &s;aid Charter made to the &s;aid Bever-makers, or any Grant therein concerning &s;earch to be made by them, that the power of &s;earch formerly granted to the Company of Haverda&s;hers of <HI>London,</HI> or to the Company of Felt-makers of <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould in any &s;ort be impeached.</P>
<P>And for that divers of Our Subjects have heretofore found inconvenience in the u&s;e of Bever-Hats intermixt with other hair or &s;tuffe then Bever, Wee do therefore &s;traight|ly charge and command, that no Bever-makers what&s;oever from henceforth &s;hall make any Hats or Caps but of pure Bever, and that in the making or working thereof, they or any of them &s;hall not intermix, u&s;e, or work, or cau&s;e to be intermixed, u&s;ed, or wrought, any hair, wooll, or &s;tuffe what&s;oever, other then good and perfect Bever, upon pain of the lo&s;&s;e and forfeiture of the &s;ame, the one moitie to Vs, Our Heirs, and Succe&s;&s;ors; and the other to &s;uch as &s;hall &s;eize the &s;ame. And Our Will and plea&s;ure is, that if upon any &s;earch to be made by the &s;aid Company of Haberda&s;hers of <HI>London,</HI> or by the &s;aid Company of Bever-makers, there &s;hall be found in any of the hou&s;es, &s;hops, Ware-hou&s;es or Work-hou&s;es, of any of the &s;aid Bever-makers, or in any other place for their or any of their u&s;es, any hair, wooll, or &s;tuffe what&s;oever u&s;ed in making of Hats or Caps other then Bever-&s;tuffe onely,
<PB N="3" REF="3">That then the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;eized by &s;uch of the &s;aid Companies of Haberda&s;hers and Bever-makers as &s;hall &s;o finde the &s;ame as forfeited, the one half thereof to be to Vs, Our Heirs, or Succe&s;&s;ours, and the other half thereof to &s;uch of the &s;aid Companies as &s;hall &s;o finde and &s;eize the &s;ame. And Our further Will and plea&s;ure is, That if the &s;aid Company of Haberda&s;hers, or the &s;aid Company of Bever-makers, upon any &s;earch by them, or either of them to be made, &s;hall finde any deceitfull Bever-Hats, or Caps, that then the &s;ame &s;hall by them that &s;hall &s;o finde the &s;ame, be &s;eized and carried to the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> of Our Citie of <HI>London,</HI> there to be tried by Iury, and in ca&s;e they &s;hall be there condemned for &s;uch, then the &s;ame to be con&s;umed by fire; The &s;aid Charter of Incorporation made to the &s;aid Company of Bever-makers, or any Grant, power or thing therein contained to the contrary thereof in any wi&s;e notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as a &s;ort of Hatts called Demyca&s;ters, wherein &s;ome Bever is intermixed, are now found not to be u&s;efull in Our Dominions, Our Will and plea&s;ure therefore is, and We do &s;traightly charge and command, That from henceforth no Haberda&s;hers, nor makers of De|myca&s;ters, nor other Hat-makers or per&s;ons what&s;oever, after Mid&s;omer day next, &s;hall ut|ter, or &s;ell any Hat or Hats called Demyca&s;ters, or other Hats wherein Bever &s;hall be mixed or wrought, with other materials by retayl, or have any &s;uch Hats in their hou&s;es or Shops to utter or &s;ell by retayl to any of Our Subjects, or others, to be worne within any Our Do|minions: And that none of Our Subjects after one yeer next en&s;uing, &s;hall wear any Demy|ca&s;ters, or other Hat wherein any Bever wooll, or Bever &s;tuffe is mixt, or wrought with other materials within Our &s;aid Dominions, upon pain of the lo&s;&s;e and forfeiture of the &s;ame to be &s;eized and taken to Our u&s;e, the one half thereof to be to Vs, Our Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ours, and the other half to &s;uch as &s;hall &s;eize the &s;ame, and upon &s;uch further penalties as &s;hall be meet for &s;uch their contempts.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;&s;e, being informed that the &s;aid Demyca&s;ters, wherein Bever is mixt with other materials, are u&s;efull and de&s;ired in forrain parts: We are plea&s;ed that the &s;aid Makers thereof, and other Hat-makers (other then the &s;aid Bever-makers) may &s;till make the &s;aid Demyca&s;ters; And that they, or any Haberda&s;hers may &s;ell the &s;ame to Merchants in gro&s;&s;e, and not otherwi&s;e, to be by them tran&s;ported from the Port of <HI>London</HI> onely, into parts beyond the &s;eas, &amp; to be there vented. And that Our Royall intention herein may be duely ob&s;erved, We do hereby &s;traightly charge &amp; command, That no Demyca&s;ter-makers, or other Hat-makers, that &s;hall hereafter make any Demyca&s;ters or Hats wherin any Bever-wooll or Bever-&s;tuffe is intermixed with other materials, &s;hall directly or indirectly &s;ell, or put to &s;ale any Demyca&s;ters or Hats wherein Bever-wooll is mixt with other materials to any per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;o|ever, before he or they fir&s;t bring the &s;ame to the common Hall or meeting place of the &s;aid Be|ver-makers in Our &s;aid Citie of <HI>London,</HI> there from time to time (as they &s;hall be &s;o brought) to be immediately marked (without fee or dutie) upon the banding place of the &s;ame Hats with the letter <HI>D,</HI> that &s;o they may thereby be known to be Demyca&s;ters, or Hats wherein Bever is mixt with other materials; And that no per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;oever, do hereafter buy, or cau&s;e to be bought any &s;uch Demyca&s;ters or mixt Hats before they have been &s;o marked with the &s;aid letter <HI>D,</HI> upon pain of the lo&s;&s;e and forfeiture of the &s;ame Hats, and &s;uch further penal|ties and puni&s;hments as &s;hall be meet for contempt of Our Royall commands herein. And We do hereby further charge and command, that from henceforth no Merchants or others &s;hall import or bring into this Our Realme any Bever-wooll, or Bever-&s;tuffe mixted with &s;and,
<PB REF="4">or any other &s;tuffe what&s;oever, to make it weigh heavy, or whereby the &s;aid Bever-wooll or Bever-&s;tuffe &s;hall be corrupted or impaired, under the penaltie of the lo&s;&s;e and forfeiture there|of, to be &s;eized to Our u&s;e, by &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as &s;hall di&s;cover the &s;ame, and to be further puni&s;hed as &s;hall be thought meet, the one moitie whereof to be to Vs, Our Heirs, and Suc|ce&s;&s;ours, and the other moitie to be to the &s;aid Corporation of Bever-makers, and their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ours, and al&s;o upon pain of Our high di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;uch penalties and puni&s;hments, as by the Laws and Statutes of this Realme, or otherwi&s;e may be inflicted on the offenders in the premi&s;&s;es for their contempt and neglect of Our Royall Will and Commandment here|in.
