<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT Engli&s;h Men of War Have been Taken, or otherwi&s;e Lo&s;t, during the Pre&s;ent WAR, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE having very lately crept abroad a certain printed Paper, im|po&s;ing upon the World a Li&s;t of what <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War have been taken by the Enemy, from the beginning of the pre&s;ent War, to the Fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> 1695, compared with tho&s;e they have Lo&s;t within

that Time; I think my &s;elf obliged to un|deceive &s;uch Per&s;ons, who &s;hall give them|&s;elves the Trouble to peru&s;e the &s;aid Paper, by laying open, not only the Partiality, but Ignorance of its Author, in the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s he has taken in hand: And in order thereunto, I &s;hall begin with the Li&s;t of the Ships of War he &s;ays the Enemy have Lo&s;t, the whole Number whereof he makes but Five; though 'tis notoriou&s;ly known, and allowed of, by the Enemy them&s;elves, That in the Year 1693, Four|teen of their Capital Ships were de&s;troyed by our Fleet, under the Command of Ad|miral <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell,</HI> at <HI>Cherbrook</HI> and <HI>La Hogue,</HI> Two of which were mounted each with One hundred and four Guns, and the others from Ninety to Fifty &s;ix, carrying in the whole One thou&s;and and &s;ixty, be&s;ides Two of Sixty Guns each, which were &s;aid to be &s;unk in Fight; which though, on their be|half, he indu&s;triou&s;ly avoids the mentioning, yet in the Li&s;t of our Naval Lo&s;&s;es, he not only gives an Account of tho&s;e Ships the Enemy have taken from us, but &s;queezes in all &s;uch as have been lo&s;t by bad Weather, or other Accidents; and even tho&s;e very
<PB N="5" REF="5">
Ships, and the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els al&s;o, which (in regard of their Age and Crazine&s;s) have (after being Ca&s;t) been either Sold, or Sunk for defence of our Docks or Gra|ving-Places from the Sea; and though the Guns belonging to tho&s;e Ships and Ve&s;&s;els were taken out and placed in His Maje&s;ty's Stores before they were di&s;po&s;ed of, yet he Sums them up among the Number of tho&s;e which have been really Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>But that it may the more plainly appear, how many Ships of each Rate the Enemy have both Taken from Us, and De&s;troyed, during this long War, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to put down the following Account, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P><PB N="6" REF="6">Which being compared with the Ships we have Taken and De&s;troyed of theirs, it will appear, that though an equal Number have not fallen into our Hands, yet con&s;i|dering the Magnitude of the Ships, and con&s;equently their Guns, amounting to al|mo&s;t the &s;ame Number as ours, (mo&s;t of which were very &s;mall,) neither the Ene|my, nor the Author, have any great Rea|&s;on to value them&s;elves upon the Advantage they have of Us in this Particular.</P>
<P>As to the Number of our Ships which have been Ca&s;t away, I am of Opinion, That, when the Length of the War, and the great Numbers of all &s;orts of Ships which have been con&s;tantly kept abroad, (even in the Winter Sea&s;on, when they mu&s;t unavoidably be expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t Hazards,) &s;hall be duly con&s;idered, it can|not be rea&s;onably expected, their Number will prove very &s;mall; but, as it is, I have here in&s;erted an Impartial Account.</P>

<P>In this place I think it not ami&s;s to ob|&s;erve, that as we are obliged to keep con|&s;tantly at Sea great Numbers of Ships both at home and abroad, the Enemy have, for Years pa&s;t, been &s;o far from ex|po&s;ing them&s;elves to the frequent Dangers attending that Element, as to keep almo&s;t their whole Strength within their Harbours, contenting them&s;elves only in carrying on a
<PB N="8" REF="4">
Piratical War; which is the only Rea&s;on that our accidental Lo&s;&s;es &s;urmount tho&s;e of theirs. But the Gentleman, again&s;t whom I have taken up the Cudgels, in&s;inuating in his Paper his own melancholy Thoughts up|on the &s;core of the great Decrea&s;e of our pre&s;ent Naval Strength, to what it was at at the beginning of the War, I have hereun|der made a mode&s;t Account, how that Matter &s;tands; by which it will appear, how little Trouble he has been at, to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Matter wherein he has employ'd his Pen.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the Lo&s;&s;es the Merchants have &s;u&s;tained during this War is very con&s;iderable; But in regard they do at a Time of &s;o great Action, and when the Seas are &s;o much pe&s;tered with the Enemies Privateers, Trade with almo&s;t as much Free|dom as if there was a &s;etled Peace, it is not a matter of Wonder (tho' tis much to be lamented,) that their Lo&s;&s;es have been &s;o great; e&s;pecially when 'tis con&s;ider'd, that they have not only very often ventured with|out Convoys, but de&s;erted &s;uch Convoys as have been appointed them, &s;o &s;oon as they came within the &s;mell of the Land, in hopes thereby to fore&s;tall the Markets. And as for the late Lo&s;&s;es of the <HI>E. India</HI> Com|pany,
<PB N="10" REF="7">
had they (by the be&s;t Information I can come at,) been plea&s;ed to have made tho&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;it at the Helm of our Naval-Force, more privy to their Af|fairs, I dare be bold to &s;ay, that much of their Lo&s;&s;es might very probably have been &s;aved, by the timely placing Ships in a pro|per Station, to have met with their Trade in its Return.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing that I think fit to take Notice of is, That in the lamentable Account he gives of the Decrea&s;e of our Sea-Strength, &s;ince the beginning of the War, he is alto|gether a Stranger, (or at lea&s;t &s;eems to be &s;o,) that above Twelve of the Ships and Ve&s;&s;els in his Li&s;t are &s;uch as the French had lo&s;t to us: and he takes a more than or|dinary Care to croud in &s;uch Fire&s;hips as have been burnt on Service again&s;t the Ene|my, and to draw the Curtain over the Pri|vateers we have taken from them; the latter whereof, in Reputation to our Sea-Comman|ders, (who, as well as others, are but too often expo&s;ed to the la&s;h of ignorant and malicious Tongues and Pens,) I have ju&s;tly numbred One Hundred Eighty Two, Sixty Seven whereof were from Ten Guns to

Fifty Six, and very few of them under Twenty; be&s;ides Ten which were de&s;troy'd between the 10th of <HI>May</HI> 1694, and the fir&s;t <HI>October</HI> 1695.</P>
