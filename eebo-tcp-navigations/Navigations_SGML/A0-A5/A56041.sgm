<HEAD>PROPOSALS For SETLING the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade.</HEAD>
<P>THE be&s;t Way to carry on that Trade, to the General Advantage of the Na|tion, is by an E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Regu|lated Company, whereby all the Sub|jects of <HI>England</HI> may have Liberty to concern them&s;elves therein at all times, upon an equal Foot.</P>
<P>'Twill be a great Encouragement for Adventu|rers, to make new Di&s;coveries, when every one may have the Management of his own Affairs, and reap the Benefit of his own Indu&s;ty; the Trade will be driven to its utmo&s;t Extent, more Ships employed, His Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms advan|ced, many of the Younger Sons of the Gentry provided for by beneficial Employments, greater Quantities of the Commodities of our Native Growth and Manufactures exported by many Buyers, which will con&s;equently rai&s;e their Va|lue here; and there will be larger Importations
<PB N="4" REF="4"> from <HI>India,</HI> con&s;equently lower the Price of the&s;e Goods, by the many Sellers at our Markets, give us great Advantages to &s;urmount our <HI>European</HI> Competitors in that Trade, and inable us to &s;up|ply all the&s;e parts of the World with the Com|modities of tho&s;e Countreys much cheaper than they, e&s;pecially if the whole Sub&s;idy may be re|paid upon all that &s;hall be Ship'd off for Parts be|yond the Seas.</P>
<P>And La&s;tly, By &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment, Three great Evils which have been practi&s;ed by the pre|&s;ent Joynt Stock, will be effectually remedied, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That of a Monopoly, wherein is but one Buyer and one Seller of all the Goods Imported and Exported to and from &s;o great a part of the World.</P>
<P>The taking up va&s;t Sums of Money at Intere&s;t upon a common Seal, which is a thing very un|equal and hazardous to the Subject, becau&s;e no particular Men's E&s;tates are liable for Payment of the &s;ame. And,</P>
<P>That pernicious and infamous Trick of Stock-Jobbing, whereby &s;everal Families have been al|ready ruined, and had its Original from this Company.</P>
<P>Now for the Con&s;titution of a Corporation to manage this Trade, and the Powers requi&s;ite for &s;uch a Company, we do further mo&s;t humbly propo&s;e,</P>
<P>That a convenient Number of Per&s;ons be ap|pointed and cho&s;en annually, to direct the General
<PB N="5" REF="4"> Affairs, who may be empowered to rai&s;e Money at a certain Rate <HI>per Cent.</HI> on all Merchandize, as may be agreed by a general Court of Adventu|rers, which &s;hall be the Company's Stock, for maintaining an Amba&s;&s;ador at the Court of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> Con&s;uls at the principal Ports, ma|king &s;uch Settlements as may upon due Con&s;i|deration be judged nece&s;&s;ary, and for defraying all other Publick Charges.</P>
<P>That every Per&s;on at his Admittance into the Company, &s;hall pay for his Freedom a &s;mall Sum for the U&s;es afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>That the Adventurers at a General Court may make &s;uch By-Laws, for the better regulating and carrying on the Trade, as &s;hall be approved of by the Lord Keeper, the Lords Chief Ju&s;tices, and the Lord Chief Baron for the time being, to be con&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of the Land.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SOME REASONS AND CONSIDERATIONS</HI> Why the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade &s;hould not be Setled in a Joynt Stock Exclu&s;ive.</HEAD>
<P>THough at the fir&s;t Con&s;titution of a Joynt Stock it is made as diffu&s;ive by the Sub&s;criptions of many in &s;mall Summs, as the nature of the thing is capable of, yet by Purcha&s;e, or otherwi&s;e, it &s;oon comes into few hands, and is attended with all the Evils that a de&s;tructive Monopoly brings with it,
<PB N="8" REF="6"> without having the lea&s;t of tho&s;e &s;pecious and pretended Advantages &s;o much talked of; and the A&s;&s;ertion, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> out of choice have &s;etled that Trade in a Joynt Stock, and that the <HI>Scotch</HI> have &s;o &s;etled it, becau&s;e it's the mo&s;t advanta|gious, is ill grounded, being done by them for the Rea&s;ons following.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> had the beginnings of their Trade to <HI>India</HI> in the Minority of their State, when they &s;trugled with the Mighty Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> in a long and bloody War; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugueze</HI> (who were then under the &s;ame Mo|narch) being Ma&s;ters of the whole Trade of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the States, to weaken their Enemies, wi&s;ely Encouraged their Merchants to &s;end Ships into tho&s;e Seas, by giving them Commi&s;&s;ions of War; and they effectually did it, by taking con&s;iderable Booties from them, and by aug|menting &s;till their Force, had great &s;ucce&s;s at Sea, and &s;eized on &s;ome of their Fortifications. This brought the Merchants of their &s;everal Towns to joyn: where, by pro&s;ecuting their Trade, and their Privateering &s;everal Years, they became very con&s;iderable. Then the States United them further, that they might yet be more &s;erviceable to annoy the Enemy, and brought the whole Trade and War into a Joynt Stock, and gave it mighty Priviledges; as of paying no Cu&s;toms In, or Out, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they enjoy to this day.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P>This was the Rea&s;on &s;o long &s;ince that indu|ced the States to this Settlement, by way of Ho&s;tility and depredation; and not that they thought it was be&s;t &s;o to do for the general good of the Trade, or that it could not be as well managed by a Regulation, if their Cir|cum&s;tances had been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company of <HI>Holland</HI> being thus E&s;tabli&s;hed, as it were by Conque&s;t, and there|by incumbring them&s;elves with many Fortre&s;|&s;es in the South-Seas, and <HI>Ceylon,</HI> to maintain to them&s;elves their mo&s;t advantagious Spice-I&s;lands (without which the Company mu&s;t fall) there &s;eems a nece&s;&s;ity upon them to drive that Trade in a Joynt Stock; for indeed their E&s;ta|bli&s;hment in <HI>India</HI> is another Common-Wealth, and their Charge to maintain their many Forts is &s;o extravagant, being forced to &s;end out twelve or fifteen hundred Men yearly; that though they bring home many very Rich Ships Annually, yet their Dividends are but &s;mall, and tho&s;e &s;u&s;pected by mo&s;t, to be rather out of their Quick Stock, for they owe and continually take up va&s;t Summs of Money at Intere&s;t, at home, as well as in <HI>India;</HI> wherein our Company hath imitated them, though they had no Spice-I&s;lands, or profitable Colonies to help defray tho&s;e Charges, but only a plain Trade, which might as well, nay much better, be carried on without Forts. And as we cannot in the one, &s;o we humbly conceive there is no Rea&s;on to
<PB N="10" REF="7"> imitate them in the other; becau&s;e we have bet|ter ways, even by a Regulation, to out-do them. For, <HI>Anno</HI> 1653. to 1657. while our Trade to <HI>India</HI> lay open to all, the <HI>Holland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company &s;unk greatly in their Stock and Credit: we under-&s;old them in all tho&s;e Commodities, and brought home Spice in &s;pight of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">, procured at <HI>Maco&s;&s;ar</HI> (a con&s;iderable Mart in the South-Seas, where we once had a Settlement) and el&s;ewhere; which gave them &s;uch apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing their Trade, that to prevent it, they employed &s;ome Per&s;ons to influence <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to E&s;tabli&s;h this pre|&s;ent Joynt-Stock, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1657. And they gave al&s;o Pen&s;ions in <HI>England,</HI> to forward the De|&s;ign.</P>
<P>And though they &s;o much applaud the <HI>Dutch,</HI> calling them a Wi&s;e People, Ma&s;ters of the My|&s;teries of Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they do not tell you that they have not the Act of Navigation upon them. So that the Condition of the People of <HI>England</HI> will be infinitely different from theirs: For if the <HI>Holland</HI> Company &s;et their Goods too high, and u&s;e the People ill, though they cannot &s;end Ships direct to <HI>India,</HI> they can &s;end to <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or any other Countrey, to buy all Goods except Spices. But if our Company be thus E&s;tabli&s;hed, the People of <HI>England</HI> have no way to help them&s;elves. For the Act of Navigation Prohibits the Importation of all Goods from any Port or Place, except that of their Growth, Production, or u&s;ual place of
<PB N="11" REF="7"> their fir&s;t Shipping. And then, if an Act pa&s;&s;es that none is to Trade to tho&s;e parts, but by a Joynt Stock, then can no <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities be imported but by them; and then if tho&s;e Gentle|men will demand one hundred pounds for what co&s;t them but five pounds, the People mu&s;t pay it, or be without; for we can buy none of tho&s;e goods in <HI>Holland,</HI> or any where el&s;e, becau&s;e tho&s;e two Laws have &s;taked us down, and wholly &s;ub|jected us to tho&s;e Men.</P>
<P>In all other Taxes we have this &s;atisfaction, that we know the mo&s;t can be demanded of us; but were this Company &s;etled, we are left to their boundle&s;s will, to order them from time to time as they li&s;t.</P>
<P>The Company do indeed pretend that they can|not &s;et their own Rates, and get what Prizes they plea&s;e, becau&s;e their Goods are always ex|po&s;ed to Sale by publick Candle, and put up low, where every Per&s;on is admitted to buy, and the Buyer &s;ets the price. Now that this Salvo is in|&s;ignificant, is known almo&s;t by every Trader's con&s;tant practice; for when a Ship, or any Goods are expo&s;ed to Sale by Candle, the Sellers have always Friends in the place, who bid until it comes up to the Seller's price. So this Relief by a publick Sale will not help; be&s;ides, the Com|pany can import &s;o little, that the Peoples wants of the Commodities, will force them to give what price they plea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> cho&s;e a Joynt-Stock before a Re|gulated Company, becau&s;e they never yet had any Trade to <HI>India,</HI> nor have their Merchants wherewithal to manage it, &s;o mu&s;t call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other Nations, both for Money and Experience, which, God be thanked, is not our Ca&s;e, being very well acquainted in tho&s;e parts of the World, having a large improved experi|ence in Trade, and Stock enough to carry it on to its full extent; &s;uch a Genius to Traffick and Na|vigation, that wherever we have met with Com|petitors, and not been clogged with Joynt Stocks (who&s;e Mannagers are Cho&s;e, not becau&s;e of their knowledge of tho&s;e Trades, or for their In|tegrity, or any other Endowment, but becau&s;e they will promote the particular intere&s;t, and ob&s;erve the directions of &s;ome Towring Men;) we have Out-Traded them all; witne&s;s, to <HI>Tur|key, Spain, Portugal,</HI> &amp;c. And in the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trade, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> mannage in a Joynt Stock, we have &s;o much exceeded them, as no Hi&s;tory can parallel.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the pre&s;ent <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company do &s;o much value their Forts, we &s;ay, That Fort St. <HI>George</HI> is Scituate where is neither Port nor Harbour, only an open Road, where no Ships can Ride upon breaking up of the <HI>Mon&s;oons</HI> with any tolerable &s;afety. Nor is this Road well Commanded by the Town, or Fort; nor can any Pa&s;&s;engers or Goods be Landed or Shipt off in other than the Country Boats, which are ex|po&s;ed to great hazard, and can be mannaged by none but the Natives, and carry but &s;ix or eight
<PB N="13" REF="8"> Bales at a time; nor have they Water, Fuel, or Provi&s;ions enough within them&s;elves to hold out a ten days Siege, being &s;upplied with all from the Countrey.</P>
<P>It is the wor&s;t &s;eated for Trade, or to make in|ve&s;tment of Goods, of any on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cor|mandel;</HI> and is now much oppre&s;&s;ed by a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e the <HI>Mogull</HI> hath lately &s;et up very near it, which exacts 5 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> upon all Goods going in, and coming out of the place; &s;o we believe the Company had no &s;uch Penniworth of it, when they agreed to allow the former Company &s;ix Thou&s;and Pounds for it.</P>
<P><HI>Bombay,</HI> it's true, is more defen&s;ible; there is a Port, and it may be relieved by Sea, yet it's a Place without Commerce, and the &s;afety and conveniency of Ships Harbouring there would be more, were it in the <HI>Mogull</HI>'s hands; for he will not &s;uffer any ho&s;tility in his Ports nor Roads, but protects all People that come thither to Trade, as may be in&s;tanced in the <HI>Con&s;tantinople Merchant,</HI> which was &s;ecured at <HI>Mechlapatam,</HI> an open Road, from five <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, 1665. and in the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> (a private Ship) and the <HI>Benja|min,</HI> a Company's Ship, who were &s;ecured two years &s;ince from five <HI>French</HI> Men of War in the Ri|ver of <HI>Suratt.</HI> As al&s;o two <HI>French</HI> Ships, who by the la&s;t Advices were &s;till riding in the Bay of <HI>Ben|gal</HI> under the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Protection, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;ix Men of War to take them, but dur&s;t not offer them any violence, although there are no Forts or Fortifications in any of tho&s;e pla|ces. Be&s;ides this place of <HI>Bombay</HI> is extreamly un|healthful.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9">
<P>But to inform you more truly, we here &s;et down four Paragraphs out of Sir <HI>John Child,</HI> the Compa|nies General, and two more of their Councils Letter, Dated <HI>June</HI> the 7th, 1689. to the pre|&s;ent <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>We wi&s;h this I&s;land may Pro&s;per and Flouri&s;h &s;uitable to your De&s;ires, but we truly think it will never be otherwi&s;e than a Charge to you; and if the <HI>Mogull</HI> takes the Countrey round about us, it will be next door to an impo&s;&s;ibility to maintain the Fort again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The Shopkeepers at be&s;t are but poor needy Fel|lows, and what they &s;ell is but ju&s;t enough to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities from hand to mouth; however, in compliance to your Order, &s;hall &s;ee and rai&s;e a moderate Duty on the Shops, as may be mo&s;t for your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be glad to rai&s;e your Revenues &s;uitable to your De&s;ires, and wi&s;h the I&s;land was in &s;uch a Condition as to be able to bear &s;uch a Charge as your Honours propo&s;e; We fear that will never be in our days, and find no rea&s;on to hope that ever it will be.</P>
<P>If ever there be a <HI>Dutch</HI> War, believe it from us, that at be&s;t we &s;hall be but in a bad Con|dition in the&s;e parts of the World, they being &s;o very numerous: But for your I&s;land of <HI>Bombay,</HI> we do verily believe they will ne|ver offer to meddle with it; for we cannot conceive what &s;hould induce them to &s;uch an &V;ndertaking.</P></Q>
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<P>And we pre&s;ume to add, nor no body el&s;e, except it were to make a Pre&s;ent of it to the Great <HI>Mogull;</HI> for the <HI>Dutch</HI> find Forts charge|able things, where they &s;upport the Trade, and will not be &s;o mad to load them&s;elves with them, where no Trade is to be expected. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> they have not long &s;ince abandoned <HI>Policat,</HI> a better Fort of their own in the Bay. But &s;hould they be &s;o, it's not doubted the &s;ame Fate will attend that, that did <HI>Gambo,</HI> a Fort of our Royal <HI>Affrican Companies,</HI> mounted with 74 pieces of Cannon, which Surrendred to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Genes</HI> with three <HI>French</HI> Friggots, upon his fir&s;t Summons in <HI>July</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P>All the good the&s;e two main Forts of St. <HI>George,</HI> and <HI>Bombay,</HI> have done the Company, is, they have rais'd them in Opinion and Greatne&s;s of them&s;elves; for they have, without any regard to the Honour of the Nation (which they only pretend unto) expo&s;ed it the mo&s;t ever Subjects did; for after their Factors had ran above Three Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds in Debt at <HI>Suratt,</HI> their Pre&s;ident made his e&s;cape from thence by particular Order of the Company, in the&s;e words, <HI>viz. That he &s;hould leave them, but leave them as the</HI> I&s;raelites <HI>did the</HI> Egyptians.</P>
<P>They took, and contrary to the Faith of Na|tions, plundered tho&s;e very Ships they had gi|ven their Pa&s;&s;es to, and &s;ent home &s;everal of the Goods, which they &s;old and divided. After
<PB N="16" REF="10"> they had &s;o taken the Ships, they made a for|mal Declaration of War, and proceeded therein, until by woeful experience they found the in|con&s;i&s;tency of War with Trade, and what a Condition they were in; as doth appear by the following Paragraphs of the afore&s;aid Let|ter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>We cannot &s;ee any hope of Trade, without making Peace with the <HI>Mogull;</HI> and we mu&s;t then pay our old Debts; and after that is done, we &s;hall not be over-&s;tock'd with Money.</P>
<P>Your Honours may be a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>Mogull</HI> is a Potent Prince, and he doth not at all value your Trade; his Subjects are not &s;o poor as you are plea&s;ed to think; we heartily wi&s;h the Wars with him and his Subjects were at an end.</P>
<P>Your Honours may firmly believe that we are willing enough not to part with any thing that we have taken, more than what we &s;ee of ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity for your intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Your Honours have neither <HI>Mergeen</HI> nor <HI>Chat|tegann,</HI> and we fear will not have &s;o Honour|able a Peace with the <HI>Mogull</HI> as is expected; but we &s;hall do what we can towards it, as becomes us.</P></Q>
<P>And accordingly they did, and &s;ent up Mr. <HI>George Welden</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and <HI>Abraham Na|varra,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="10"> a <HI>Jew</HI> (which latter when they kept their High Court of Admiralty in <HI>India,</HI> was &s;tyled His Maje&s;ty's Attorney General) to the Court of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI> to &s;ue for Peace, where, after they had been &s;ome time, and made their way by Pre&s;ents, they were admitted to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Pre|&s;ence, but it was in the Po&s;ture of Malefactors, obtain'd his Pardon and Allowance of Trade, in a Phirmaund granted them in the Words follow|ing:
<Q><P>All the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having made an humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Petition, That the ill Crimes they have done may be pardoned; and reque&s;ted a Noble Phir|maund, to make their being forgiven manife&s;t; and &s;ent their Vakeels to the Heavenly Palace, the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious in the World, to get the Royal Favour; and <HI>Ettimand Chawn,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Suratt</HI>'s Petition to the famous Court equal to the Skies, being arrived, That they would pre&s;ent the Great King with a Fine of <HI>150000</HI> Rupees to his Noble Trea&s;ury re&s;embling the Sun, and would re&s;tore the Mer|chants Goods they took away to the right Owners of them, and would walk by the ancient Cu&s;toms of the Port, and behave them&s;elves for the fu|ture no more in &s;uch a &s;hameful manner.</P>
<P>Wherefore His Maje&s;ty, according to his daily Fa|vour to all the People of the World, hath pardoned their Faults, mercifully forgiven them, and out of his Princely Compa&s;&s;ion agrees, That the Pre|&s;ent be put into the Trea&s;ury of the Port, the
<PB N="18" REF="11"> Merchants Goods be returned, the Town flouri&s;h, they follow their Trade as in former Times; and that Mr. <HI>Child,</HI> who did the Di&s;grace, be turned out and expelled.</P></Q></P>
<P>Having thus laid before you the Honour this Company hath done the Nation, in pro&s;ecuting the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade; and &s;hewed how u&s;eful their Forts are to pre&s;erve that Trade, e&s;pecially in time of War with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> we proceed to the Priviledges which the Company do pretend to have obtained in <HI>India</HI> with va&s;t Expence and Charge: And do aver,</P>
<P N="1">I. That they are all owing to the Emba&s;&s;ie of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, by Sir <HI>Tho. Row, Anno</HI> 1615. of which the <HI>Mogul</HI> certified the King in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<PB N="20" REF="12"> in the Bay, were accu&s;ed as Pirates by the &s;aid Company's Factors, and as &s;uch brought be|fore the Government; and his Excellency Sir <HI>John Goldsburrow,</HI> the Company's then Commi&s;&s;ary General over all <HI>India,</HI> having heard that the <HI>Hen|ry</HI> (another Private Ship, in whom was Mr. <HI>White</HI>) was gone to <HI>Suratt,</HI> did write to the Pre&s;ident there, acquainting him, <Q><HI>That an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Pirate, one Captain</HI> Pitt, <HI>was come into the Bay, on pretence of Trade, was &s;eized, and had upon Examination con|fe&s;&s;ed, that there was another gone for</HI> Suratt, viz. <HI>Mr.</HI> White, <HI>as great a Pirate as him&s;elf; requiring the Pre&s;ident to acquaint the Governour therewith, that he might be &s;eized al&s;o, to prevent all further Da|mage to the</HI> Mogul'<HI>s Subjects.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All this notwith&s;tanding, and that the&s;e People are extreamly exa&s;perated again&s;t Pirates, having &s;uffered &s;o much by Piracy, they could not by this Artifice be drawn from their accu&s;tomed Ju|&s;tice: But having entered into the matter, though the Company's Factors bribed high at <HI>Suratt</HI> to prevent it, that they might take it <HI>pro Confe&s;&s;o;</HI> they, upon the Merit of the Cau&s;e, admitted both the&s;e Ships to Trade, and to return to <HI>England</HI> with the Produce of their Cargo in the proper Commodities of tho&s;e Places, which were as good and as cheap as ever were purcha&s;ed by the Com|pany; nor did they pay any more Cu&s;toms, Du|ties or Acknowledgments, than the pre&s;ent Com|pany always did, and now do.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="12">
<P>And this pre&s;ent Company are &s;o far from ha|ving enlarged the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> that they had be|fore this late Charter, and Sub&s;criptions thereunto, reduced their Trade to &s;o low an Ebb, that the Farming it out to <HI>Jews, Armenians,</HI> and others, was the chiefe&s;t of their Bu&s;ine&s;s: For their Drift was not to enrich the Nation, but them&s;elves: And their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that without an Act of Parliament exclu&s;ive to all others (upon which not only they, but the mean|e&s;t of Men may rai&s;e Money to carry on the Trade) they cannot upon their own Bottom &s;end out the number of Ships they have declared to di&s;patch thither this Year, although above the va&s;t Sums they owe at Intere&s;t, they have advan|ced 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Stock, in taking 80 <HI>l.</HI> paid in Guineas at 30 <HI>s. per</HI> Piece for 100 <HI>l.</HI> and give Bills under their Common Seal for paying 112 <HI>l.</HI> at the end of two Years; which is 20 <HI>per Cent. per Annum</HI> for the Money received. And to avoid the Law again&s;t Extortion, the Condition is, If Twelve of the Ships named of tho&s;e they have abroad, and now going out, do mi&s;carry, then their Bond is void; but if any one of them arrives, it is in full Force and Virtue.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>England</HI> are an indu&s;trious People, and Lovers of Trade; they do not upon &s;mall, no, not upon great Di&s;couragements give it over, but do rather endeavour to recompence them&s;elves by the &s;ame Voyages: Otherwi&s;e, the <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the <HI>Malaga,</HI> the <HI>Virginia,</HI> and all
<PB N="22" REF="13"> the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Trades, with many others now clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, had been left off long &s;ince. Where there is any hope of Vending our home-Commodities, they are ready to carry them even to unknown, and but in part di&s;covered Places, far beyond a joint Stock, who cannot, being once &s;o con&s;tituted (for it would be again&s;t their Oaths &s;hould they) prefer the Publick Good in Preju|dice of their Joint Stock, which &s;uch Companies were never known guilty of, always Exporting and Importing no more of any Merchandize, than what will yield them their &s;etled Profits; and employing few others than Men of broken For|tunes, or Youths at very mean Salaries.</P>
<P>Whereas particular Merchants in a Regulated Company (who cannot make Combinations) will carry out and bring home much greater Quantities of all Commodities, imploy many of the Younger Sons of the Gentry, who may &s;ettle Hou&s;es, rai&s;e E&s;tates there, without being at the Plea&s;ure of a few Men; add greatly to our Navigation, Encrea&s;e the Cu&s;toms, and will in every Point be of Infinite Advantage to the Publick, as well as them&s;elves, who&s;e Right and Property it is, that the Commerce and Traffick by Sea be as unlimitted and free as the Inland Trade.</P>
<P>It is therefore humbly hoped, That a Regula|ted Company for <HI>India</HI> will be erected, whereby the Right of the Subject may be pre&s;erved, and the Trade carried on, to the Intere&s;t and Honour of the Nation.</P>
