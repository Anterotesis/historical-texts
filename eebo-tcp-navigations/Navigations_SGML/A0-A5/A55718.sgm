<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BUDA.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the <HI>Turks</HI> invaded <HI>Hungary,</HI> the City of <HI>Buda</HI> was the <HI>Metro|polis</HI> of the Kingdom; the Ancients called it <HI>Curta,</HI> and the <HI>Germans Offen.</HI></P>
<P>It is divided into the Upper and Lower Town, lying upon the &s;ide of a Hill, the Foot whereof is wa&s;hed by the <HI>Danube,</HI> which at that place is a|bove half a mile over: It hath a Bridge of Boats over it, that joins the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> to the little Town of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> ly|ing on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. In <HI>Buda</HI> are to be &s;een the Ruines of &s;everal &s;tately Palaces, built heretofore by <HI>Matthias Corvinus</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and his Predece&s;&s;ours; which the <HI>Turks</HI> neg|lect, and let fall into decay.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="22">
<P>This is a large, fair, and well built Town, but ill peopled, and hath hard|ly any Inhabitants, but the <HI>Spahies</HI> and <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> of the Garri&s;on, which is al|ways very numerous.</P>
<P>After the Death of <HI>John Zapol,</HI> Count of <HI>Scepus</HI> and <HI>Elba</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> his Widow <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> of <HI>Po|land</HI> and his Son <HI>Stephen,</HI> called in the <HI>Turks</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, again&s;t <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who was elected King.

<P>THE chief Dignity of this King|dom next to the King, is that of <HI>Palatin,</HI> who calls the E&s;tates during an Inter-reigne, and who hath the fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful voice in the Electi|on of the King.

He hath ab&s;o|lute Power in the Armies, &s;o that he can puni&s;h and reward all, as he thinks good, and be&s;tow a&s;much Land as Twenty or Thirty men are able to Labour. He hath great Revenues, not only from the Salt-pits, but from other things al&s;o; and heretofore he had the Rents of the two I&s;les on the Coa&s;t

<ARGUMENT>
<P> Of the Ceremonies ob&s;erved in the Coro|nations of the Kings and Queens of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter all nece&s;&s;ary Preparations have been made for the Solem|nity of the Coronation, the Ceremo|nies of it are performed in this manner: In the fir&s;t place, an Election is made of tho&s;e who are to go and fetch the Crown, Scepter, Globe, repre&s;enting the World, Sword, Coat of Arms, the Royal Habits, and Cro&s;s, in the City of <HI>Presbourg,</HI> where they are kept, with the Standards of the King|dom. They di&s;charge this Duty, and carry them to the Church. The Pa|latin takes the Crown, and places it on the right &s;ide of the Altar, where the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Strigonium</HI> &s;ays Ma&s;s; the Prelates &s;it about the Steps of the Altar, and &s;ome of them lead the King from the Throne to the Al|tar, or from the Altar to his Seat; the
<PB N="134" REF="69"> re&s;t &s;erve for &s;ome other Action of the Coronation. The Kings Throne dec|ked with Cloth of Gold, is pretty near the Altar, and oppo&s;ite to the middle of it, having over it a Cloth of State, of the &s;ame Stuff as that of the Seat. The King kneels fir&s;t upon the Steps of the Altar, and Ki&s;&s;es the Cro&s;s, which the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Stri|gonium</HI> pre&s;ents to him; then takes the Oath contained in the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontifi|cal, &s;aying the Words after the Arch-bi&s;hop, and laying his Right hand on the Go&s;pel, with Eyes lifted up to Heaven, as if he called God to wit|ne&s;s. After the Oath, he is anointed by the Arch-bi&s;hop on the right Arm near the Elbow, and betwixt the two Shoulders: Then being cloathed with the Coat of Arms of King St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> he receives from the &s;ame Arch-Bi&s;hop, the naked <HI>Cuttelas</HI> of the &s;ame Saint, then gives it back to the Arch-bi&s;hop, who returns it into the Scabbard, and then girds it to his &s;ide. That being done, the King turned towards the Altar, as Defender of the Altars, Re|ligion, and the Church, draws the Sword out of the Scabbard,
<PB N="135" REF="69"> and brandi&s;hing it three ways in the Air gives &s;o many blows; then the Arch-Bi&s;hop taking the Crown, gives it to the Palatin, who holding it up on high with both his Hands, and being upon the Steps of the Altar, asks aloud all that are pre&s;ent, if they would have him Crown'd for their King, and having three times put the &s;ame que|&s;tion unto them, upon their an&s;wer|ing in the Affirmative, he is crowned, and receives from the Arch-Bi&s;hop the Scepter in the right hand, the Globe in the left, and all the marks of Roy|al Dignity: After that he &s;its down on the Throne, as taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom. Then all the <HI>Hun|garians</HI> make loud Shouts and Accla|mations, wi&s;hing the King a long and pro&s;perous Reign, and at the &s;ame time, the Vocal and In&s;trumental Mu|&s;ick, the Trumpets, Drums, and Can|non, mingle their noi&s;e with the confu&s;ed Voices. Ma&s;s being &s;aid, and the Streets, through which the King is to go, being Boarded and co|vered with White, Green, and Red Cloth, the King walks from the Church, where he was, to another,
<PB N="136" REF="70"> wearing the Crown and Coat of Arms, &s;ome carrying before him the Royal Ornaments and Standards, and a great many others walking before and after him. At the &s;ame time pieces of Gold and Silver are &s;cattered a|mong the People, in all the Streets through which the King pa&s;&s;es, who coming to the other Church, &s;its down on the Royal Throne erected there, and makes &s;ome Knights, &s;triking them thrice on the Back with the naked Sword of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> as they are knee|ling before him. This being done, he comes out of the Church, and mount|ing on Hor&s;e back, with the Crown and Coat of Arms, having the &s;ame per|&s;ons on Hor&s;e-back, who walked be|fore or followed him on foot, as he came in the &s;ame Order he goes out of the Town, and alighting, with the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Strigonium</HI> mounts up upon a Theater, where lifting up the Right hand he takes an Oath to the <HI>Hungarians</HI> to maintain the Priviledges of the Nobility, do Ju&s;tice to all, ob|&s;erve the Laws of the Kingdom, and procure the good of the Publick.</P>
<P>In the mean time all are uncovered, and when he hath taken the Oath, all
<PB N="137" REF="70"> again &s;hout, and amid&s;t the noi&s;e of great Guns wi&s;h him all &s;ort of Pro&s;pe|rity. Afterwards he mounts a &s;tately and well-managed Hor&s;e, and &s;purs him towards an adjoyning ground, where putting him upon the Carrier, and drawing the Sword of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> he makes in form of a Cro&s;s, four &s;troaks in the Air, turning his Hor&s;e very nimbly, as threatning the four Corners of the World, and then there is nothing to be heard but Volleys of great Guns. After this the new King putting his Hor&s;e to a Walk, draws near the Lords who are Spectators, and with them goes to his Pallace, where he fea&s;ts them, &s;itting at Table with his Crown and Coat of Arms, and being &s;erved by &s;ome Ba|rons and Grandees of the Kingdom, appointed for that Office; and when Dinner is over, they who have the charge of the Crown, and Royal Orna|ments carry them back to their place.</P>

<PB N="138" REF="71"> of <HI>Newbourg</HI> was Crowned Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI> in the Town of <HI>Edimbourg</HI> in the year 1681.

<P>The Train of the Empre&s;s came after, before whom Count <HI>John Dra&s;|kowich</HI> walked with the Scepter, in place of Count <HI>Dra&s;kowich,</HI> the Ste|ward of the Kingdom went before. The Counts <HI>Stephen Zichy</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;to|pher Erdedy,</HI> both Keepers of the Crown, came next, with the Lords who carried the Royal Jewels upon Cu&s;hions of Crim&s;on Velvet. Count <HI>Illi&s;hazi</HI> carried the Silver Cro&s;s, Count <HI>Nicholas Erdedy</HI> the Scepter, the Pala|tin of <HI>Hungary</HI> the Crown, and Count <HI>Nicholas Dra&s;kowich</HI> the Globe of the Empire. The <HI>Empre&s;s</HI> came after the&s;e, led by the Duke of <HI>Diederich&s;tein</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Palace. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Rapach</HI> chief Governante carried up her Train, which was embroidered
<PB N="139" REF="71"> with Gold, Diamonds and Pearls, and after her came the Palatine&s;s and other Ladies of Court. The Empere&s;s was received at the Entry into the Church, by the Arch-Bi&s;hops of <HI>Colocza</HI> and <HI>Neutra,</HI> who led her to the Throne. In the mean time the Emperour ha|ving taken his place on the &s;ide of the Go&s;pel, went al&s;o to his Throne in the middle of the Quire over again&s;t the great Altar, behind the Throne &s;ate the Palatine&s;s with the chief Go|vernante and other Ladies of Court, in Chaires prepared for them. On the left hand of the Empre&s;&s;es Throne were the Lords of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who carri|ed the Jewels of the Kingdom, which were taken from them by the Arch-Bi&s;hop who put them upon the Altar. Before the Throne there was a Silver Stool, where the Dome&s;tick Crown, which was brought to the Church un|der a Cover, was placed. That being done the Go&s;pel was read, at the end whereof the Emperour went to the Altar with the Crown on his Head, the Scepter in his Right Hand, and the Globe in the Left, and pre&s;ented the Empre&s;s to the
<PB N="140" REF="72"> Arch-bi&s;hops to be crowned. When his Imperial Maje&s;ty had taken his place, the Empre&s;s advanced towards the Altar, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Arch-bi&s;hops, and kneeled upon the fir&s;t Step, whil&s;t the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Gran</HI> ki&s;&s;ed the end of the Cro&s;s, and pre&s;ented her the Scepter and Globe of the Empire, which &s;he took, the Scepter in her right hand, and the Globe in the left, the Prelate all the while &s;aying &s;ome Prayers. That Ceremony being over, the Empre&s;s was led back to the Throne, where the Arch-bi&s;hop hav|ing again &s;aid &s;ome Prayers, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung during a Volly of 480. Musket|&s;hot, and a di&s;charge of the Artillery upon the Rampart. Then Count <HI>John Draskowich</HI> took the Scepter and Globe of the Empire out of the hands of the Empre&s;s, in place of the Steward of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and gave them back to tho&s;e who had carried them before. That being done, the Empre&s;s was led to the Offering by the Arch-bi&s;hops, and put a rare piece of Gold of Gold-Smiths work into a Silver Ba&s;on that was up|on the Altar, and then returned to her Throne. The Dome&s;tick Crown was
<PB N="141" REF="72"> taken off of the Head of the Empre&s;s by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Neutra,</HI> during the Offering and Communion, and given to be held by the Duke of <HI>Diederick&s;teyn,</HI> who after the Communion gave it back to the &s;aid Prelate, to be put up|on the Head of the Empre&s;s again. The afore&s;aid Bi&s;hop led her to the Communion, which being given her by the hand of the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Gran,</HI> the Crown was put upon her Maje&s;ties head. The Ceremonies thus performed, they returned in the &s;ame Order as they came, with the noi&s;e of Cannon, and the Ladies were ad|mitted to ki&s;s her Hand. When they were at Table, his Imperial Maje&s;ty ordered the Artillery once more to play, which concluded the Solemnity.</P>

Be&s;ides that, the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> gave him the allarm &s;o hot, that the <HI>Viziers</HI> were re&s;olved to dethrone him, if the Peace, which he made with the&s;e People, had not al|tered their minds. <HI>Amurath</HI> concerned
<PB N="159" REF="81"> him&s;elf indirectly in the Affairs of the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Germany,</HI> at the Sollicita|tion and under the Conduct of <HI>Ragot|ski;</HI> but it happened to the Confu&s;ion of both. He had at length the Plea|&s;ure to be revenged on the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> In the year 1638. He &s;et out into the Field, as it is thought, one of the mo&s;t numerous Armies that ever the <HI>Otto|mans</HI> had on foot, and making u&s;e of the favourable juncture of the War betwixt the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Mogols,</HI> he be|&s;ieged <HI>Bagdet,</HI> and took it in fourty days time. <HI>Amurath</HI> enjoyed not that Victory long, for his Debauches brought him to his Grave the 8th of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 1640. in the Two and thirtieth year of his Age.</P>
<P>This <HI>Amurath</HI> IV. in a Letter which he wrote to the King of <HI>Hungary</HI> in the year 1640. took the following Ti|tles.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>By the Grace of the Almighty God in Heaven, we</HI> Soly-Mahomet <HI>only God upon Earth, full of invincible Graces, and Omnipotent Emperour of</HI> Babylon in Ju|dea, <HI>from the Sun-ri&s;ing to its Setting, King of all the Kings of the Earth, King of all</HI> Arabia <HI>and</HI> Media, <HI>Duke &s;prung

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Ibrahim,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> was the Son of <HI>Achmet,</HI> and &s;ucceeded to his Brother <HI>Amurath</HI> IV. in the year 1640. When this la&s;t died the Officers of the Port had a great deal ado, to make him come out of the place where he had been in a manner Pri&s;oner for three or four years, &s;u&s;pecting it to be only a pretext to render him Criminal. The <HI>Sultana</HI> his Mother per&s;uaded him of the truth, having &s;hown him the dead Body of his Brother, he came out, and having been crown'd, he gave him&s;elf wholly over to Voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;s, which was fatal unto him. The lo&s;s of one of his <HI>Sultana</HI>'s, whom the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> took in the year 1644. betwixt <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> made him undertake to be revenged on <HI>Malta.</HI> But he turned his Arms a|gain&s;t <HI>Candie,</HI> and took the <HI>Canea</HI> in 1645. In the mean time he grew cru|el, his Plea&s;ures made him abandon all care of the Affairs of the Empire, and he became in&s;upportable to all Men.
<PB N="161" REF="82"> The Militia and Officers con&s;pired a|gain&s;t him, and &s;ent for the <HI>Mufti</HI> and other con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of the Law, on de&s;ign at fir&s;t to put to Death the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier:</HI> Then they re&s;olved to depo&s;e <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> who expre&s;&s;ing a great Contempt, and much Haughtine&s;s, did &s;o incen&s;e tho&s;e mutinous Spirits, that they &s;trangled him the 18th. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1649. and placed <HI>Mahomet</HI> his Son up|on the Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> IV. was Born the &s;econd of <HI>January</HI> 1642. and was rai&s;ed to the Throne ten days after the Death of <HI>Sultan Ibrahim</HI> his Father, who was &s;trangled by the <HI>Jani&s;aries.</HI> In the years 1663. and 1664. He took in <HI>Hun|gary</HI> the Towns of <HI>Newheu&s;el, Fort-Se|rin</HI> or <HI>Serin-wart,</HI> afterwards demoli&s;h|ed, and &s;ome other places. The lo&s;s he &s;u&s;tained at the Battle of <HI>Raab</HI> or <HI>St. Godard</HI> made him re&s;olve to make Peace, which he did the 17th. of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> 1664. He hath been more un|fortunate in the pre&s;ent War, where|in he hath lo&s;t <HI>Gran, Newheu&s;el</HI> and a great many other &s;trong Places and Battles mentioned before. He took the City of <HI>Candie</HI> in the year 1669.
<PB N="162" REF="83"> after a very long and tough Siege. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have taken many impor|tant Places from him in this War, both in the <HI>Morea</HI> and el&s;ewhere. His great|e&s;t delight is in Hunting, wherein he &s;pends mo&s;t part of the year. For that rea&s;on it is that he re&s;ides commonly at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> that he may be near the places where there is mo&s;t Game. He goes often to <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> and &s;pends &s;ome|times Eight or Ten Days together un|der magnificent Tents, pitched half a League from that Town upon the Banks of the <HI>Peneus.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> in his time have made many Conque&s;ts from the <HI>Poles,</HI> from whom they have taken <HI>Caminiec,</HI> and &s;ome other places. <HI>Sobieski</HI> great Mare&s;hal of the Crown, and at pre&s;ent King of <HI>Poland,</HI> was at that time General of the <HI>Polonian</HI> Ar|my, who defeated the <HI>Turks</HI> at the Fa|mous Battle of <HI>Gotzchin</HI> in the year 1673. He eluded their Projects the two years following, and at length re|duced them to de&s;ire a Peace. Since that, the <HI>Turks</HI> undertook a War a|gain&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> and got &s;ome ad|vantages over them in the year 1678. and the <HI>Poles</HI> having confederated with
