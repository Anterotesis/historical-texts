<HEAD>&para; A true Report of three &s;trange accidents which lately happened at Pernaw, a Cittie in Liffland&eacute; &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_WE finde (gentle reader) in an|cient Hi&s;tories, and principal|ly in the workes of that famous and learned writer <HI>Flauius Io&s;e|phus lib.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. that before the lamentable and woful de|&s;truction of Hieru&s;alem, there appeared many &s;trange &s;ignes both in the aire, and among the people, namely there was &s;&eacute;ene right aboue the &s;aid Cit|tie a dreadfull Starre, in forme and fa&s;hion of a Sword: as al&s;o that in the darke night cleare day appeared and was &s;eene in the Temple: that a Cow brought forth a Lambe, and which was mo&s;t &s;trange, a certaine man went vp and downe among the people, continually for the &s;pace of &s;eauen yeares before, not cea&s;ing with wo|ful cries, to forwarne and admoni&s;h the people to for&s;ake their wickednes: fore &s;hewing the de&s;truction of the place.</P>
<P>The very like, yea and almo&s;t the verie &s;ame acci|dents &s;ignes and wonders, haue lately happened within this whilome mo&s;t plea&s;ante Countrie of <HI>Livonia,</HI> in
<PB REF="3"> the Cittie of <HI>Pernaw:</HI> for in the yeare 1599. vppon Saint Lukes day, a certaine Merchant of the &s;aid Cittie, ha|uing (according to the cu&s;tome of the Countrie) enuited many of his freinds and Neighbours to a fea&s;t at his hou&s;e, among the re&s;t al&s;o, enuited thither a certaine old man of the &s;ame Cittie who&s;e name was <HI>Stile,</HI> a man of the age of foure &s;core yeares or thereabout, knowne to all the inhabitants there to be borne deafe and dumbe, and had &s;oe continued all his life tyme to that day.</P>
<P>This olde man being placed at the table among the company, and &s;eing the great and horrible abu&s;e of the good guiftes and creatures of God which were there pro|uided, by tho&s;e abhominable vices of gluttony and drun|kennes, and not being able to endure the &s;ight therof, by the iu&s;t iudgment of God pre&s;ently leapt ouer the Table, and with a fierce and &s;terne countenance, turning his eyes toward the people, and wringing his hands as a &s;igne of the great &s;orrow which he conceiued at his hart, bur&s;t forth in the&s;e &s;peaches to the Companie which were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Alas quoth he (my deare freinds) how can you be thus merrie, when a man &s;eeing this abhominable abu&s;e, to the high di&s;plea&s;ure of almightie God, might well loathe to liue any longer in &s;o wicked a time. Therfore (deare brethren and &s;i&s;ters) repent, repent I &s;ay, for the pun|ni&s;hment of the Lord God is neare at hand: with greate &s;tormes and ouerflowing waters, wil he de&s;troy the wic|ked, and nothing but affliction and punni&s;hment &s;halbe their portion.</P>
<P>Such dearth that yeare &s;halbe that the people &s;hall not finde any foode for nouri&s;hment, nor any way to e&s;cape by rea&s;on of the trouble&s;ome warre to come: great plague pe&s;tilence and murren &s;hall de&s;troy both younge and old, therfore liue ye as if pre&s;ently ye &s;hould die, for &s;urely it is at hand: great and horrible wonders &s;hall ye heare,
<PB REF="3"> and &s;&eacute;e many &s;trange and mon&s;trous Children borne, as a looking-gla&s;&s;e both for rich and poore.</P>
<P>The people with great admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment came running together to &s;ee this miracle which had hap|penned, and the Company which were enuited being da&s;ht with this &s;uddaine accident, haueing now giuen ouer their pa&s;time and being &s;ore ama&s;ed were with one accord attentiue to the &s;peaches of the olde man, percei|uing a&s;well by his &s;trange ge&s;tures as by the &s;uddainnes of his &s;peach that this was Gods onely doings: and being moued with great feare and horror, asked him at what time all tho&s;e things &s;hould happen: wheruppon the &s;aid dumbe man thus pre&s;entlie replied.</P>
<P>Ere the yeare 99 be come and pa&s;t, the Lord God in his iu&s;t anger and wrath will draw his &s;word, therfore repent you of your &s;innes, for the day of iudgment is at hand.</P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;poken, the man was againe bereft of his &s;peach, and became dumbe as before, f&eacute;eling him &s;elfe pre&s;ently &s;icke, and the next day after he died: and was honorably buried, being accompanied to y^e Church, by an infinite number of the inhabitantes there, whoe greatly lamented for his death.</P>
<P>The next day after his buriall, there was a certaine woman brought forth a man childe, with a naturall face before, and behind like the &s;cull of a dead man, his right arme al&s;o was like a Sword, and the other like a Rodde: which child liued two dayes and no longer.</P>
<P>After this the Lord &s;hewed an other, no le&s;&s;e fearefull &s;igne of his indignation and wrath, for iu&s;t ouer the &s;aid Cittie of <HI>Pernaw,</HI> was perfectly &s;eene in the cleare Fir|mament or Skie, a Beere and Coffin, couered all with blacke: which &s;ight endured from foure of the clocke in the afternoone, till eleuen in the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P>Therefore good chri&s;tians, con&s;ider fir&s;t the &s;uddaine
<PB REF="4"> and fearefull &s;p&eacute;ech of the Dumbe, &s;econdly, looke vppon the mon&s;trous birth and &s;hape of this Childe, and la&s;tly, meditate vppon the fearfull &s;igne &s;&eacute;ene in the Ayre, and therevpon with an humble and penitent hart, imagine the Tragicall end of all, pittying the afflicted Countrye and people of <HI>Lyffeland,</HI> and let their hard fortune be a warning to thee, that thou &s;inne no more pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly.</P>
<P>And as y^e heathen <HI>Poet</HI> &s;ayeth. <HI>Foelix que~ faciunt aliena pericula cautum,</HI> that is to &s;aye, happy is he which can beware by other mens perilles: make thy &s;elfe happie with this warning, and doe not with the wicked and &s;tubborne Iewes, contemne and &s;corne, this gentle ad|monition, and fore-warning of the Dumbe, lea&s;t God in his Iu&s;tice bring a wor&s;e Plague vpon vs, then he did eyther vpon tho&s;e Iewes or vppon this Countrey of <HI>Lyffeland.</HI></P>

<HEAD>&para; A true Report, of the late victo|rie atchiued by the great Sophy: together with the king of Per&s;ia, vpon the Turkes &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_WHereas the great Turki&s;h Emperour with all his Armie, munition, and pre|paration, was come to the Ryuer of <HI>Eu|phrates,</HI> being &s;trong both of Hor&s;e &amp; foot, about three hundred Thou&s;and men, and perceauing that <HI>Morath</HI> generall of y^e <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> had cau&s;ed the Bridge to be pulled down there, y^t was made ouer the &s;aid Riuer, and that he was marched on th'other &s;ide, and hard by a mountaine did prepare and &s;trengthen him&s;elfe with y^e forces &s;ent vnto him by y^e great <HI>Sophy,</HI> with tho&s;e hee had before, &s;o that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were &s;tronge about Foure-&s;core and tenne Thou&s;and men, among&s;t the which were about twenty Thou&s;and, whereof every one of them, had two hor&s;es for a man.</P>
<P>The Turke could not haue &s;o much inteligence to vnder&s;tand if the <HI>Sophy</HI> him&s;elfe were per&s;onally pre|&s;ent in the Campe, or no: or if he yet were in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> for more forces, which he e&s;pecially did feare.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e therfore he could not pa&s;&s;e ouer the Riuer,
<PB N="11" REF="6"> he in all ha&s;t cau&s;ed the bridge to be builded againe, and &s;ent ouer the &s;aid Riuer two Genneralls called <HI>Beller|byes</HI> with their forces, to wit <HI>Bellerby</HI> of <HI>Gretia</HI> and <HI>Bel|lerby</HI> of <HI>Natolia,</HI> but he him&s;elfe tarried on this &s;ide of the water till the next morning.</P>
<P>Now about two houres before day breaking the Gen|nerall <HI>Moreth</HI> fell in the Campe of <HI>Bellerby</HI> of <HI>Grecia,</HI> who had encamped him&s;elfe &s;omwhat farre off from the <HI>Bellerby</HI> of <HI>Natolia,</HI> and mo&s;t valiently came vppon him with &s;uch a force and power, that he vppon a &s;oddaine mo&s;t &s;p&eacute;edily did ouercome all his En&s;ignes and Tents, and ouerthrew and &s;lew all his Campe.</P>
<P>The Soldiers of the Campe of the <HI>Bellerby</HI> of <HI>Natolia</HI> h&eacute;erwithall were put in &s;uch a feare, that they ranne in to the Riuer, and pa&s;&s;ed ouer to the Campe of the great Turke,</P>
<P>The <HI>Turke</HI> &s;&eacute;eing this ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e, pre&s;ently planted his Ordenaunce in good order one by an other, and pla|ced the &s;ame right again&s;t the Enemie which was on the other &s;ide of the water: and becau&s;e they &s;hould not &s;&eacute;e the Ordinaunce, he commaunded that &s;ome Companies &s;hould be placed and &s;tand before the &s;aid Ordinance, with this token, that when the peices of Ordinance &s;hould be all in readines and charged, they &s;hould &s;ound Alarme and the &s;aid Companies &s;tanding before the &s;aid Ordinance &s;hould part a&s;ide, and &s;o to di&s;charge the &s;aid peices of Ordinance vppon the Enemie.</P>
<P>This determination being agr&eacute;ed vppon, and fire be|ing put to the afore&s;aid Ordenance, many of them did bur&s;t and fly abroad, and &s;lew and hurt a notable num|ber of men, yea and many of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Armie: by the noi&s;e, cry, and tumult wherof, many Hor&s;es and Mules, with tho&s;e that were on the backs of them did leape into the Riuer and were drowned,</P>
<PB N="12" REF="6">
<P>The <HI>Sophians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> which had &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;&s;e of men by means of the Ordinance, retired on the other &s;ide of the Mountaine, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that at that time were &s;laine and &s;hot to death about Twentie thou&s;and <HI>Sophians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>They retireing &s;o backwards as is afore&s;aid, the <HI>Turke</HI> with all his whole Armie pa&s;&s;ed ouer the Riuer, and marched towards the Mountaine where the <HI>Sophi|ans</HI> were encamped, who had deuided them&s;elues into foure partes or &s;quadrons, k&eacute;eping clo&s;e together: and when they &s;awe that the <HI>Turkes</HI> came vppon them, they were glad, and mo&s;t valiently met and fought with them &s;o that on both &s;ides many men were &s;laine: but the night ouertooke them, which was to the aduantage of the <HI>Sophians</HI> for it was not po&s;&s;ible that they could re&s;i&s;t and with&s;tand longer again&s;t the great force and power of the Turkes, therefore by Night they all did flye to the Mountaine, the Turkes for darkene&s;&s;e could not follow them, as they were minded and would faine haue done and &s;o the Turke tarrying in the fieldes that Night pur|po&s;ed and concluded the next day to leaue all his footemen with the p&eacute;eces of Ordinance behind him and with hor&s;e|men onely to pur&s;ue the Enemies and by the&s;e meanes vnawares to &s;urpri&s;e and take the Towne of <HI>Tauris,</HI> be|fore tho&s;e of the Towne &s;hould heare of the ouerthrowe of the <HI>Sophy.</HI></P>
<P>But on the other &s;ide, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Sophians,</HI> which dilligently did looke to them&s;elues, and had great care to the matter, concluded with them&s;elues, that ten thou&s;and men which were the day before newly ariued, &s;hould marche again&s;t the <HI>Turkes,</HI> and when the <HI>Turkes</HI> &s;hould come vppon them, they &s;hould fl&eacute;e, as if they were ouercome, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Sophians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> which were yet about twentie thou&s;and, &s;hould come be|hinde
<PB N="13" REF="7"> the <HI>Turks,</HI> and compa&s;&s;ed them betw&eacute;en them both, and without doubte they &s;hould &s;p&eacute;ed well, and ouercome their enemies. The next morning, the <HI>Turke</HI> &s;&eacute;eing that the enimie was yet &s;o neare at hand, he thought they had not bin able to fly any further for darknes, came vpon the~ with great force: but they pre&s;ently according to their agreement did fly, and the <HI>Turkes</HI> not thinking on this martial pollicie, did pur&s;ue them till noone, and being come to a &s;mall Riuer, becau&s;e they were &s;omwhat wea|rie, and tired, encamped them&s;elues on the &s;aid Riuers &s;ide and there dined: and after dinner the fre&s;h <HI>Turkes</HI> leauing the wearied and tyred Companies with all their trea&s;ures and &s;poiles behinde them, thinking the next night vnawares to &s;urprize the Towne of <HI>Tauris,</HI> did pur&s;ue and cha&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Sophians,</HI> in their fained flight.</P>
<P>But when they came to the Towne, in all ha&s;t a po&s;t came to the great <HI>Turke</HI> about two houres in the night, who certified vnto him that the ennimie had ouerthrown and &s;laine all his footemen which he had left behinde, and that they had gotten the pieces of Ordinance, and &s;till were coming with all their forces behinde him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turke</HI> hearing &s;uche newes, and thinking on the great trea&s;ure that he had left behind him, pre&s;ently went back againe, and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Sophians</HI> which h&eacute;ertofore did flie, turned al&s;o backe againe, and &s;awe that their forces did follow and pur&s;ue the <HI>Turks</HI> behinde. The <HI>Turkes</HI> which tarried with the trea&s;ure on the &s;aid water &s;ide, perceiuing their Enemies did breake vp and runne away, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Sophians</HI> being before and behinde the <HI>Turkes,</HI> came fiercely and valiantly vppon them, and did great hurt among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Turke</HI> much di&s;contented, &s;&eacute;eing that the
<PB N="14" REF="7"> Ennemie had &s;o craftilie compa&s;&s;ed and brought him in the middle betw&eacute;ene them, begun a mo&s;t harde and hote battaile, wherin the <HI>Sophians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> got the victo|rie: which when the <HI>Turkes</HI> &s;aw, they did fly out on the one &s;ide, for otherwi&s;e it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour him&s;elfe, when he &s;awe that all his forces did fly, and that all his En&s;ignes were ta|ken, did likewi&s;e fly to &s;aue his life, and came with a mo&s;t &s;wifte hor&s;e to <HI>Ama&s;ia,</HI> and tarried in <HI>Natolia</HI> till the remnant of his Armie (which was verie little) was gathered together: for the Turkes did nothing but flie all the Night, and al tho&s;e which were &s;lack in running, were all cut downe: and tho&s;e that came ouer the Riuer pulled downe the bridge made by them before, to the end the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;hould not pur&s;ue them: but the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Sophians</HI> being glad of the victorie, as Conquerours of the fielde, went home againe: although they would faine haue pro&s;ecuted their victorie, had not the mo&s;t part of their forces been &s;laine</P>
