<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE famous and ever to be admired Art of Navigation, having been &s;o learnedly handled and written of, not only in all other Languages, but al&s;o in our Mother-Tongue, by &s;o many learned and able men, both of former and of our pre&s;ent Age, that it may &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible to write any thing more thereof that hath not already been done by others; yet in my experience which I have &s;een, being at Sea in &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, where divers young Mariners have been: I have heard this general Complaint among them, that though the things that are chiefly u&s;eful for them in their Art may be found in &s;everal Books here
<PB REF="3"> and there di&s;per&s;ed; yet they could wi&s;h that there were &s;uch a Book contrived, that might be &s;oley u&s;eful for them entire by it &s;elf, which then would be more convenient for them, and might be purcha&s;ed at a more rea&s;onable rate than otherwi&s;e they could be, by buying of &s;o many &s;orts of Books, which they mu&s;t be con&s;trained to do, if ever they intend to be able Proficients in that mo&s;t noble Profe&s;&s;ion of Navigation, at which they chiefly aimed.</P>
<P>This Complaint of theirs, was one chief Motive which induced me to collect and com|po&s;e the &s;ub&s;equent Treati&s;e, which I have en|deavoured to handle in &s;uch a methodical man|ner, as it ought to be read and practi&s;ed by the young Seaman. For</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, There is a Treati&s;e of ARITHMETICK, containing all the Rules thereof, which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Seaman to know and practi&s;e, all or mo&s;t of the Que&s;tions thereof being made applicable in one kind or other to Nautical Affairs.</P>
<P>Secondly, There is a Treati&s;e of GEOMETRY, containing the fir&s;t Grounds and Principles thereof, with the making and dividing of the
<PB REF="3"> Mariners Scale and Compa&s;s, with the pro|jecting of the Sphere in Plano, and the re&s;ol|ving of many Que&s;tions in A&s;tronomy, which are u&s;eful in Navigation thereby.</P>
<P>Thirdly, you have a Treati&s;e of the practick part of NAVIGATION, wherein is &s;hewed, after a new experienced way u&s;ed by the Author, how to keep a Reckoning at Sea: the making and u&s;e of the Plain Sea-Chart: the Doctrine of plain Triangles made applicable to &s;uch Que&s;tions in Navigation as concern Cour&s;e, Di&s;tance, Rumb, Difference of Longitude, and Departure: likewi&s;e, a Table of Meridional parts to every third Minute, and the application and u&s;e there|of exemplified in Que&s;tions of Sailing by <HI>Mer|cator</HI>'s Chart: with Tables of Longitude and Latitude of Places, of right A&s;cen&s;ion, and Sea|&s;ons of certain Fixed Stars, with Rules to keep a Reckoning, and to find the Latitude by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun or Stars.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There is a &s;hort Treati&s;e of ASTRONOMY, wherein you have the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles applied to Que&s;tions in A&s;tronomy and Navigation.</P>
<P>This is the brief Sum and Sub&s;tance of the following Treati&s;e, which I commend to the
<PB REF="4"> Practice of all young Sea-men, de&s;iring their kind acceptance of the&s;e my fir&s;t Labours, which if I &s;hall find to be kindly entertained by them, it will encourage me to lanch farther into the more nice and critical part of this mo&s;t no|ble Science. In the mean time I commend this to them, wi&s;hing good &s;ucce&s;s in all their hone&s;t and laudable undertakings, and in the interim bid them Farewel.</P>

<HEAD>The U&s;e of the Table to number.</HEAD>
<P>THis Table &s;ignifies thus much, That if there be one Figure alone, it is but &s;o many units as there is in its name, as 7 is &s;even ones or units. If there be two Figures, the fir&s;t Figure towards the left hand is as many tens as there is units in its name, and the other Figure is units: As if it were 10, that is ten units: if it were 23, the fir&s;t Figure is two tens, that is twenty units: and the next Figure is 3, that is three units. The next place is hundreds, and con|&s;i&s;ts of three Figures, as 700 is &s;even hundred: 723 is &s;even
<PB N="2" REF="7"> hundred twenty three. And thus you may count any Number by ob&s;erving the place of any Figure, and in their places gi|ving them their names as you count: As &s;uppo&s;e I have a Num|ber, namely 7864319, if you tell from 9 backwards to 7, you will find 7 in the place of millions, then begin and &s;ay &s;even millions: then if you count again, you will find 8 in the place of hundred thou&s;ands, 6 in the place of ten thou&s;ands, and 4 in the place of thou&s;ands, then to give them their proper Number, you will read thus: Seven millions for 7, eight hundred thou|&s;and for 8, &s;ixty thou&s;and for 6, four thou&s;and for 4, that is, Seven millions eight hundred &s;ixty four thou&s;and; then for 3 three hundred, for 1 ten, and for 9 nine units, that is then altogether 7 millions 8 hundred 64 thou&s;and 3 hundred and ninteen, which is the quantity of units that is in the given Number 7864319.

<P>THis Rule well under&s;tood, is the Sum of the re&s;t that fol|low it; for they are all (but as it were this Rule) it is cal|led <HI>The Golden Rule,</HI> becau&s;e it is the Foundation of the re&s;t: It is called <HI>The Rule of Three,</HI> becau&s;e three numbers are given to find a fourth.</P>
<P>Now there is the Rule of Three direct, and the Back Rule of Three: the Rule of Three direct, is for &s;uch que&s;tions as are &s;o &s;tated, that the third number and &s;econd multiplied together, and that Product divided by the fir&s;t gives the fourth.</P>
<P>The Back Rule of Three is &s;o &s;tated, that the fir&s;t number
<PB N="20" REF="16"> and the &s;econd are multiplied together, and that Product divi|ded by the third, finds the fourth.</P>
<P>And this is all the di&s;tinction that I can make between the forward and backward Rule of Three, which is all the Rule of Three: I will not make therefore two di&s;tinct Rules of them, (but one) therefore pray ob&s;erve this difference:</P>
<P>In all Que&s;tions in the Rule of Three there is three things given to find a fourth, which number will have alike proportion to the third, as the &s;econd hath to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;tating your Que&s;tion, be &s;ure let it be &s;o that you may &s;et your &s;um in order with the fir&s;t and third number, &s;peaking both of one thing: I mean if the fir&s;t be Ells let the third be Ells; if the fir&s;t be Degrees, let the third be degrees, or &s;ome|thing that Degrees can be reduced to.</P>
<P>If your Sum be &s;et with the numbers in &s;everal Denominations, before you bring your Sum in order, you mu&s;t reduce your num|bers into the lea&s;t Denomination: As &s;uppo&s;e your Sum was this, If 5 pound 10 ounces of Tobacco, co&s;t 10 &s;hillings 9 pence, what &s;hall 510 pounds co&s;t? Reduce your 5 pounds 10 ounces into ounces, and your 510 pounds into ounces: likewi&s;e your &s;hillings into pence, taking in the odd pence and odd ounces, as I have &s;hewed how to do it in page 16 and 17.</P>
<P>Your Sum being reduced (as I have &s;hewed) into the lea&s;t Denominations, &s;et it in order thus:</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> 90 <HI>Ounces co&s;t</HI> 129 <HI>pence, what co&s;ts</HI> 81600 <HI>ounces?</HI></P>
<P>Your Sum being in order, con&s;ider whether your third num|ber require more or le&s;s: if it require more, multiply the &s;econd number by the greate&s;t of the two extreams, and divide that Product by the le&s;&s;er, it produceth the fourth number in the &s;ame Denomination that the middle number was.</P>
<P>If your third number require le&s;s, multiply the middle num|ber by the lea&s;t of the two extremes, and divide that product by the greate&s;t, and it gives your fourth number in the &s;ame denomi|nation that your &s;econd number was; then if you de&s;ire to reduce it into greater Denomination, do it as I have &s;hewed already.</P>

<P>Here we have found what the Principle hath gained for a twelve-month, next con&s;ider what proportion 12 Months is to the time your money was lent, which was 24 Months: now if
<PB N="25" REF="18"> it had been three times as long a time as 12 Months, you mu&s;t have made it 3 times as much as you find it for 12 Months, but being but twice as much, you mu&s;t make the U&s;e to to be twice 28 68/100 which is 57 <HI>l.</HI> 36/100 of a pound; the &s;ame is to be under&s;tood of any number el&s;e; but in &s;tead of &s;eeing what proportion the time limited for the lent bears with 12 Months, you may work it as you do the Rule of five Numbers, by &s;aying (after you have abbreviated your Fraction.)</P>
<P>If 12 Months give 28 <HI>l.</HI> 68/100, what &s;hall 24 Months gain? But I &s;ay the other way is be&s;t, after your other manner; If it had been one fourth of the time, it would have been &frac14; of the u&s;e; if one fifth of the time, &frac15; of the u&s;e.

<P>I might &s;ay &s;omething of Intere&s;t upon Intere&s;t, but that differs but little from this: At the years end, add in your &s;imple Intere&s;t to your Principal, and make it one entire Sum till the next year, then add that Intere&s;t to the Principal the year before, and receive the Intere&s;t of it: this is all it differs from the former.</P>

<P>The &s;maller Circles of the Sphere, are all &s;uch Circles as do not divide the Sphere of Heaven into two Hemi&s;pheres, and &s;o are le&s;s than tho&s;e that do; and they be four, namely, The two Tropicks, and the two Polar Circles, which to di&s;tingui&s;h

<P>All Circles that cut through the two Poles of the World, are called Meridians; and are al&s;o Great Circles, becau&s;e they di|vide the Sphere into two Hemi&s;pheres, cutting in two oppo&s;ite points: it is certain, if a Circle goeth through two oppo&s;ite points, it is as great a Circle as that globous Body can bear, and mu&s;t divide that Body into two Hemi&s;pheres, as doth the Meridian A B C D.</P>
<P>The Poles are two oppo&s;ite places in the Heavens, and are the ends (as it where) of that Line called the Axletree, which the Heavens may be imagined to turn upon: here that Line is called the <HI>Axis of the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Aequinoctial is a Great Circle of the Sphere, which lieth between the Pole &s;o equally, that its di&s;tance from either Pole is 90 degrees (the half of the di&s;tance between the Poles) and becau&s;e it is &s;o equal between them, there begins Latitude; &s;o that what&s;oever Latitude you are in, &s;o many degrees and mi|nutes the Aequinoctial is below that part of the Heavens which is right over your head, and is called the Zenith; or from being right under you, which is called the Nadir. All Meridians cut this Aequinoctial at right Angles.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t and We&s;t Azimuth is a Great Circle of the Sphere that cuts through two oppo&s;ite points of the Heavens, namely, the Zenith and Nadir: it al&s;o cuts the Horizon at right Angles in the points of Ea&s;t and We&s;t; and therefore is called the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Azimuth: all Azimuths are great Circles and cut the Horizon at right Angles.</P>
<P>The Horizon is a Great Circle of the Sphere, and divides that part of the Heavens which we do not &s;ee, from that part which we do &s;ee: or it is the furthe&s;t part of the Heavens which we can &s;ee for the Body of the Sea; it is only to be &s;een at Sea, or upon the &s;hore where there is no land between you and it, and &s;o you have divers Horizons according to your motion, for as you rai&s;e one part of the World, you lay the other.</P>

<HEAD>How to Project a Sphere.</HEAD>
<P>THis Sphere or Scheme is projected on this wi&s;e: Fir&s;t, take an Arch of 60 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale of Chords, and de&s;cribe the Meridian M A E R. Now the rea&s;on you take ju&s;t 60 <HI>deg.</HI> is becau&s;e that number of degrees taken from the Scale is the Semidiameter of the Circle the Scale was made by: &s;o then what&s;oever you take from that Circle, and apply to the Scale, it will be the quantity of it in degrees and minutes; or from the Scale if you take any di&s;tance, and apply it to the Circle, it will be the &s;ame quantity upon the Circle, that it was upon the Scale.</P>
<P>The Meridian being thus de&s;cribed, draw the line A R through the Center, which repre&s;ents the Horizon: Cro&s;s that at right Angles, and draw the line E M, which is the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Azimuth.</P>
<P>Then becau&s;e the Sphere is made for the Latitude of 50 <HI>deg.</HI> take 50 <HI>deg.</HI> from your Scale of Chords, and fix one foot in the Horizon at A, and &s;et the other foot upwards to B, (make a prick or mark) which is to &s;ignifie that the North Pole is ele|vated or rai&s;ed above the Horizon &s;o many degrees as the La|titude is.</P>
<P>Keep the &s;ame di&s;tance in your Compa&s;&s;es, and go to E with one foot, and let fall the other upon the Meridian on the left hand, which will be at G, and will repre&s;ent that point of the Aeqinoctial that cuts the Meridian of that place which is the neare&s;t point of the Aequinoctial to that Zenith, and is as much below the Zenith, as the Pole is above the Horizon.</P>

<HEAD>The Meaning of the Terms u&s;ed in the following Work.</HEAD>
<P>THe Latitude of any place is the Di&s;tance between the Zenith of that place, and the Aequinoctial in degrees and minutes.</P>
<P>The Elevation of the Pole is always equal to it, and is the Poles height above the Horizon in degrees and minutes.</P>
<P>Altitude &s;ignifies the Height of a thing: If it be meant of a Star, or of the Sun (not being upon the Meridian) it is meant the Di&s;tance between the Sun or Star and the Ho|rizon.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="32">
<P>Meridian Altitude is the Suns height above the Horizon, when he is upon the Meridian of that place, which is at 12 of the Clock; or at any other time when a Star is upon the Meridian either North or South.</P>
<P>The Suns true Amplitude of ri&s;ing or &s;etting &s;ignifies the number of degrees and minutes that the Sun ri&s;eth from the Ea&s;t, or &s;ets from the We&s;t points of the Compa&s;s in the Horizon, as it is found in the Sphere.</P>
<P>The Suns true Azimuth of ri&s;ing or &s;etting &s;ignifies the di|&s;tance (in degrees and minutes) of the Suns ri&s;ing or &s;etting (in the Horizon) from the North or South points in the Compa&s;s, as it is found in the Sphere.</P>
<P>There is the true Amplitude of the Suns ri&s;ing and &s;et|ting, and the Magnetical Amplitude; the Magnetical Am|plitude is the degree of the Compa&s;s that he is ob&s;erved to ri&s;e or &s;et upon, and is Called Magnetical Amplitude from the Load-&s;tone: The Magnetical Azimuth is Called &s;o for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and is the Suns ri&s;ing from the South or North.</P>
<P>Longitude is the Ea&s;ting or We&s;ting between two places in degrees and minutes, if in &s;ailing.</P>
<P>Departure from the Meridian is the Ea&s;ting or We&s;ting between two places in miles or leagues.</P>
<P>Latitude, as I have &s;aid, is the Di&s;tance of the Aequi|noctial from the Zenith of that place in degrees and minutes, or the Elevation of the Pole; but Difference of Latitude is the Northing or Southing that a Ship makes in any Di|&s;tance run, or between two places, either in degrees, leagues, or miles.</P>
<P>Declination (if it be meant by the Sun, or any Star that is near the Aequinoctial) is the neare&s;t di&s;tance between the Sun or Star and the Aequinoctial.</P>
<P>Stars that are nearer the Poles, their Declination are their neare&s;t Di&s;tance to the Poles.</P>
<P>The Suns place in the Ecliptick is his neare&s;t Di&s;tance from the place where the Suns Parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to the next Aequinoctial point, which is &Aries; or &Libra;.</P>

<P>IN this or any other Sphere, M G E is that part of the Hea|vens that is vi&s;ible, the other half invi&s;ible to us; for it is parted from our &s;ight by the Earth and Sea, and the furthe&s;t part of it, which &s;eems to mix as it were with the Heavens, we call the Horizon, which is the great Circle M E (for it is a great Circle, though here we are forced to repre&s;ent it by a &s;treight Line) M is the South point of the Horizon: Now the Suns Meridian Altitude is his di&s;tance between that point and the place he cuts the Meridian that day, which is M I; fix your Compa&s;&s;es in M, and extend the other foot to I, and apply it to your Scale of Chords, and as many degrees as you find it there, &s;o many degrees is the Sun high when he is upon the Meridian that day, which is the thing required.</P>
<P>Note that at O the Sun ri&s;eth, at P it is 6 of the Clock, and P I is equal to &Aries; K (when it is extended to a great Circle) and both the Sine of 90 <HI>deg.</HI> which is extended to a Chord, mu&s;t be the Chord of as many degrees, which is 6 hours in time.

<P>THe Sun is due Ea&s;t (in this Example or any other) when he goeth by the Ea&s;t point of the Horizon; or We&s;t, when he goeth by the We&s;t point. In this Example, the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Azimuth in S, which is later in the morning than 6 of the Clock, by the di&s;tance S P: therefore &s;ee what S P is by <HI>The third way of Mea&s;uring,</HI> and convert it into time, and add it to 6 hours, it &s;hall give the hour of the Suns being due Ea&s;t.</P>

<P>VVHen the Sun is neare&s;t the Zenith (in any Latitude) that day mu&s;t be the longe&s;t: now in places near the Aequi|noctial, as between the Tropicks, there is but little difference all the year long; but in places nearer the Poles, there is more.</P>
<P>The Sun is neare&s;t the Zenith in this Latitude, when he is in the Tropick of Cancer, &s;o that then mu&s;t be the longe&s;t Day. Imagine the Tripick of Cancer to be the parallel of the Suns Declination (as indeed it is that day) take the di&s;tance between Y and R, which is between Suns Ri&s;ing and 6 of the Clock that day, and &s;et it off by the <HI>Third way of Mea&s;uring,</HI> the number of degrees and minutes convert into time, and add it to 6 hours, which makes the length of the Forenoon, and that doubled is the length of the whole day (as in <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7.) which is equal to the longe&s;t Night in that Latitude.</P>
<P>I find it here to be 16 hours 10 minutes.</P>
<P>Subtract the length of this longe&s;t day from 24 <HI>h.</HI> 00 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>And it leaves the length of the &s;horte&s;t night 7 <HI>h.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>Equal to which is the length of the &s;horte&s;t day 7 <HI>h.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI></P>
<P>But you may mea&s;ure the length of the &s;horte&s;t day, and &s;ub|tract that from 24 hours, and it will be the length of the longe&s;t night, which is equal to the longe&s;t day.</P>
<P>Now the &s;horte&s;t day is when the Sun is in the Tropick of Capricorn, for then it is late&s;t before he ri&s;eth: Now to mea|&s;ure it, take the di&s;tance from 6 of the Clock, which is T, and the Suns Ri&s;ing which is U, and &s;et it off by the <HI>Third way of Mea&s;uring,</HI> convert the degrees into time, and &s;ubtract that time from 6 hours, it leaves the length of the Forenoon, which doubled is the length of the &s;horte&s;t day; (as in <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7.) I have &s;poke to that purpo&s;e. I need &s;ay no more, that 7^t^h^. Que&s;tion is light &s;ufficient.</P>

<P>Al&s;o, if you &s;ubtract this Amplitude V &Aries; from &Aries; H 90 <HI>deg.</HI> the remainder is the Suns Azimuth from the South V H, or if you add V &Aries; to &Aries; A (90 <HI>deg.</HI>) it is V A the Suns Azimuth of ri&s;ing from the North; fora&s;much as V A is as much above 90 <HI>deg.</HI> as V H wants of it: The &s;ame is to be under&s;tood in any Sphere, that the Amplitude and Azimuth of the Sun are Complements one of an other, to 90 <HI>deg.</HI> in that Quarter.</P>

<P>But &s;uppo&s;e it were time of year that the Sun were return|ing from the Tropick towards the Aequinoctial, and were the &s;ame Declination, then would the Suns place be the &s;ame from

<P>The Suns right A&s;cen&s;ion is mea&s;ured from the place where the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to 6 of the Clock, which is I 6; &s;et it off by the third way of Mea&s;uring to extend it to a Great Circle: for the Sine of I 6 is equal to the Sine of S &Aries;; when you have mea&s;ured it, convert it into time, and &s;et it down; I find it to be 1 hour 44 <HI>min.</HI></P>

<P>Subtract this We&s;t departure 374 Leagues, from 950 the whole Departure, and I find there is &s;till wanting 576 Leagues; This 576 Leagues is the Departure that is from the Meridian that my Ship is in, and <HI>Ditiatha.</HI></P>
<P>Subtract al&s;o the Latitudes one from the other, (namely, the Latitude your Ship is in, and the Latitude of <HI>Ditiatha</HI>) and the Remainder is the Difference of Latitude in degrees and minutes between the Ship and the Place you are bound to, which in this Example I find to be 6 degrees 24 minutes. Take the Latitude out of the Column of Latitude for that day in the Reckoning, and you will find it &s;o, if you &s;ubtract 16 <HI>deg</HI> 16 <HI>min.</HI> from it.</P>
<P>Thus you have the Difference of Latitude between you, that day, and your Port, and the Departure that the Port hath from the Meridian that you are in that day, given you to find the things demanded; I will not work it, for it hath beeen &s;hewed &s;ufficiently already.</P>
<P>I have here following &s;et down a Reckoning, and afterwards how I work it, and la&s;tly the rea&s;on that makes me u&s;e this way of keeping my whole Reckoning in the la&s;t line, &s;o that I am not troubled to add it up, when I give account of it.</P>

<P>Again, the next day at noon, I work my Ships Travis, as hath been &s;hewed, and I find that &s;he hath departed from the Meri|dian &s;he was in ye&s;terday 38 Leagues We&s;t, which I add to what I had before, which was 21, and it makes 59 Leagues; and thus I go forwards, adding my la&s;t days departure in its true Column to all the re&s;t, (which is in one &s;um) and by this means the la&s;t line is the whole Reckoning.

<P>Al&s;o, I carry the We&s;t departure along in its full number of Leagues in the &s;ame line, without increa&s;e or decrea&s;e, till &s;uch time as I have more to increa&s;e it, and then I increa&s;e that, and carry the whole Ea&s;ting with it in the &s;ame line: and thus you have need to look upon nothing, but the la&s;t line, to re&s;olve you any thing that you de&s;ire, either of your cour&s;e made good &s;ince you &s;et out, your di&s;tance upon a &s;traight line that you have failed, your Ports bearing from you, what departure is yet be|tween

<P>I commonly &s;et down the Ea&s;ting or We&s;ting between the place I &s;et and the place I am bound to at the beginning of my reckoning, as al&s;o the Latitude of each place, as I have done here.

<P>It would have been nece&s;&s;ary here to have &s;et down &s;ome Ta|bles to have worked Triangles by, for (as I have &s;aid) &s;ometimes in 24 hours you have a Travis of 4 or 5 &s;everal cour&s;es, and to work them this way may &s;eem tedious.

<HEAD><HI>CONCERNING</HI> the <HI>VARIATION</HI> OF THE COMPASS.</HEAD>
<P>THere is always two things given to find the Variation of the Compa&s;s; that is, the true Amplitude of the Suns ri&s;ing, and the Magnetical Amplitude of the Suns ri&s;ing or &s;etting: the true Amplitude of the Suns ri&s;ing, is, (as I have &s;aid before in another place) the true and ab&s;olute quantity of degrees, that the Sun ri&s;eth from the Ea&s;t, (either Northwards or Southwards) or &s;ets from the We&s;t, and is found (as I have before &s;hewed) in the u&s;e of the Sphere.</P>
<P>The Magnetical Amplitude of the Sun, is what the Sun ri&s;eth from the Ea&s;t, or &s;ets from the We&s;t by the Compa&s;s: Now be|cau&s;e the fir&s;t gives the Truth how far the Sun ri&s;eth from the Ea&s;t, or &s;ets from the We&s;t; therefore what&s;oever difference there is between them, &s;o much is the variation.</P>
<P>As now, Suppo&s;e I find in a certain Latitude &s;uch a day of the Month (by the Sphere) that the Sun ri&s;eth to the Northwards of the Ea&s;t 17 degrees; that is, the true Amplitude: but I ob&s;erve the Sun at her Ri&s;ing, with an Azimuth Compa&s;s (which is made for that purpo&s;e) and find that &s;he ri&s;eth but Ea&s;t 10 degrees Northerly; then I conclude the Variation is 7 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> or the Compa&s;s is fal&s;e &s;o much; &s;o that whereas if I direct my Cour&s;e Ea&s;t 10 degrees Northerly by the Compa&s;s, I do not go on that Cour&s;e, but I go Ea&s;t and by North 5 <HI>deg.</HI> 45 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly, which is ju&s;t 7 <HI>d.</HI> from my expectation, or Ea&s;t 17 <HI>deg.</HI> Northerly,
<PB N="103" REF="57"> the true Amplitude. Now that is a gro&s;s error, and in long runs may deceive a man much, and perhaps be a means to lo&s;e a Ship, when one little thinks of it; and therefore it ought to be looked to.</P>
<P>An Azimuth Compa&s;s is no other in effect, but a Compa&s;s fitted for the exact taking of the Sun at her Ri&s;ing or Setting, or upon other certain times of the day, as you may have occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In like manner you may find the Variation of the Compa&s;s at other times, by taking the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Suppo&s;e I were in the Latitude of</HI> 33 deg. 20 min. <HI>Northerly, and upon the</HI> 8^t^h^. <HI>day of</HI> November <HI>the Suns Declination is Southerly</HI> 19 deg. 20 min. <HI>I demand the Suns Azimuth at</HI> 8 <HI>of the Clock.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The Suns Azimuth at her Ri&s;ing (as I have &s;hewed) is the Complement of the Suns Amplitude; but after the Sun is up, it may be al&s;o the Di&s;tance of the Sun from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Azimuth: Now in this Propo&s;ition, you de|&s;ire to know how many Degrees the Sun is from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Azimuth, (which is that Part of the Heavens that is di&s;tant from the Sun) parallel to the Horizon over the Ea&s;t Point of it; or if it had been at 4 of the Clock in the Afternoon, it would have been required from the We&s;t Point.</P>
<P>For the re&s;olving this Que&s;tion project a Sphere (as hath been taught) for the Latitude propo&s;ed, with the Parallel of the Suns Declination drawn as it is given: Divide this Parallel of Declination into the hours of the day from 6 to 12, or which &s;erves from 12 to 6 in the Afternoon; the way to divide it is thus; From 6 of the Clock &s;et off 15 degrees by the third way of mea&s;uring, which will be 7, then (becau&s;e 30 de|grees is two hours in time) next &s;et off 30 degrees by the third way of Mea&s;uring from 6, and it makes 8 a Clock; then take
<PB N="104" REF="58"> 45 <HI>deg.</HI> which is three hours, and it makes 9 a Clock, then 60 <HI>deg.</HI> for 10 a Clock, then 75 <HI>deg.</HI> for 11 a Clock, and then 90 <HI>deg.</HI> which will ju&s;t fall in the place where the Sun comes to the Meridian for 12 a Clock. Thus you divide the Parallel of the Suns Declination into hours, as you may &s;ee in the Sphere here following: it being thus divided, the Suns Azi|muth at 8 of the Clock is 8 &s;, taken off by the third way of Mea&s;uring, I find it to be 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> (by the Scale) &s;o it is certain that the Sun &s;hould be ju&s;t 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> to the Southwards of the Ea&s;t at 8 of the Clock, then I will &s;ee how high he &s;hould be at that time, and I find him to be 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 50 <HI>min.</HI> equal to &s; &Aries;, take off &s; &Aries; by the &s;econd way of Mea&s;uring. I will ob&s;erve the Sun till I find him at that height, and then I know it is 8 of the Clock; &s;ee by your Azimuth Compa&s;s whether he be 33 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> from the Ea&s;t or no, and if not, what it differs, &s;o much is the Variation of the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I have wrought this Example no nearer than the plain Scale works it, which po&s;&s;ibly may be 15 <HI>min.</HI> or half a de|gree of the Compa&s;s out of the way, but that is no con&s;i|derable error in a Cour&s;e, which is the thing we here u&s;e it for.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be done at any time of the day, as La|titude 32 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> North, Declination 19 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> South.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e it were cloudy, but at &s;ome time the Sun breaks out, &s;o that I have an opportunity to take his height with my Quadrant, and al&s;o his magnetical Azimuth with my Azimuth Compa&s;s: Now I find his height to be r t, equal to N P, and the Azimuth at that time is N t, it being drawn parallel to the Horizon; this N t &s;et off by the third way of Mea&s;uring, and &s;o much as it comes to, &s;o much is the true Azimuth of the Sun from the Ea&s;t towards the South: Take your magnetical Azimuth at the &s;ame time, and as much as they differ, &s;o much is the Variation: And thus much for the Variation of the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I have known &s;ome able men that have mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and I have ob&s;erved that it hath been mo&s;t commonly, when the
<PB N="105" REF="58">
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> Sun hath had North Declination, &s;o far that he hath been to the Northwards of that Latitude. Now I &s;uppo&s;e the rea&s;on of it may be this.</P>
<P>When a man ob&s;erves the Sun with a Quadrant (which is our u&s;ual In&s;trument) he takes the upper edge, which is to the Northwards in this Latitude. Suppo&s;e then I &s;et from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> and am bound to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I make ob&s;ervations of the Sun as often as I can all the way, till I bring the Sun to the Zenith: after I pa&s;s the Zenith, the edge of the Sun that was highe&s;t is lowe&s;t: Now he that doth not con&s;ider this, lo&s;eth the
<PB N="106" REF="59"> bredth or Diameter of the Sun, &s;o that your ob&s;ervations may differ from your expectation 30 miles, which is enough to mi&s;s an I&s;land; therefore I advi&s;e you always to allow the Suns Di|ameter (which &s;ome count 30 <HI>min.</HI>) to every ob&s;ervation you make in places where the Sun is to the Northwards of you; that is, make your Meridian Altitude 30 <HI>min.</HI> le&s;s than it is, which is the Altitude of the lower edge, which was your upper edge before you cro&s;&s;ed the Zenith, where the Sun was; or if you work your ob&s;ervations by the Complement of his height, make that 30 <HI>min.</HI> more.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s the be&s;t way would be at all times to &s;ubtract the Semidiameter of the Sun, which is 15 <HI>min.</HI> from your Meridian Altitude: But becau&s;e the Latitude of Places are not &s;et down with this con&s;ideration, it is more &s;afe to do as before, unle&s;s you know otherwi&s;e by your own experience. This only by the by to give notice.</P>

<P>Upon the 11th. of <HI>June,</HI> I ob&s;erve the Sun again in the &s;ame place, and I find the Meridian Altitude of the upper edge of the Sun is 80 <HI>deg.</HI> 12 <HI>min.</HI> (Note that this upper edge is oppo&s;ite to the edge before, for the Suns Declination is 23 <HI>deg.</HI> 30 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly, which makes that the Sun gives a South Horizon) I add the Suns Declination to the Meridian Altitude, and it gives 103 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 <HI>min.</HI> the Di&s;tance between the Aequinoctial and the North Horizon, from which &s;ubtract 90 <HI>deg.</HI> and the remainder is the Aequinoctial's di&s;tance from the Zenith, or the Latitude which is 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 <HI>min.</HI> Now this Latitude &s;hould agree with the other, for the place &s;tands &s;till; but for want of
<PB N="107" REF="59"> this &s;ubtracting the Semidiameter of the Sun, it differs 30 <HI>min.</HI> and when men meet with things thus at Sea, for want of minding of this they run 30 <HI>min.</HI> more Southerly than they &s;hould do, which I &s;uppo&s;e may be the greate&s;t rea&s;on of their mi&s;&s;ing this I&s;land, and others that lie near the Aequinoctial; but for tho&s;e places that lie far from the bounds of the Sun, it is not to be minded: Yet it were good (methinks) if all Places had been laid down with allowance for the Suns Semidiameter; but be|cau&s;e they are not, you ought to be careful, when at any time you cro&s;s the Zenith of the Sun: I have not been my &s;elf in a time of year to cro&s;s the Suns Zenith, and therefore I only &s;et this down by way of Caution to tho&s;e that may.</P>

<P>The rea&s;on that the proportion &s;tands thus, is becau&s;e the Angles are equal in each Triangle, and therefore the &s;ides mu&s;t be proportional.</P>
<PB N="146" REF="81" MS="y">
<P>Thus the Ea&s;termo&s;t Ship &s;ailed 10 7/10 leagues, the We&s;ter|mo&s;t 8 leagues, and the Ea&s;termo&s;t Port bears from the We&s;ter|mo&s;t Ea&s;t 4 <HI>deg.</HI> 14 <HI>min.</HI> Northerly.</P>
<P>There is no Di&s;tance that a man &s;ails, but if he returns the &s;ame way that he went out, he &s;hall find the &s;ame Di&s;tance back|wards as he did out.</P>
<P>But now, the World is round, and if a man goeth out one way, and returns another (as it is common) he will find a great deal of difference in long runs. For to demon&s;trate the rea&s;on of this I &s;hall not, becau&s;e my Father and others have done that &s;ufficiently, be&s;ides, it would take up too much room in this little Book.</P>
<P>The&s;e Que&s;tions of Sailing may be under&s;tood in &s;uch ca&s;es as this is, namely, when a man &s;ails the &s;ame way home as he doth out: But becau&s;e the Winds will not &s;uffer a man to do &s;o, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know &s;ome better way to &s;ail by. Let a man return never &s;o contrary to what he &s;ailed outwards, yet at all times to know how near or how far he may be off.</P>
<P>Now there is no way better than <HI>Mercator</HI>'s way of Sailing, it is very excellent, and hath been treated of by many, and that makes me pre&s;ume to think that I may treat of it as well as others. And fir&s;t here are the Tables of Meridional Parts, by which you are to work.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration of the Table of <HI>MERIDIONAL PARTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e Tables are in my Fathers Works to every &s;ix mi|nutes, but here to every three minutes; &s;o that if a man light not upon the very number that he de&s;ireth, he may the ea&s;ier take it, for it will be but one third or two thirds of the Difference between the two neare&s;t to be added or &s;ubtracted; I &s;uppo&s;e it will be the le&s;s trouble&s;om; I have gone no farther than &s;ixty degrees, becau&s;e I would not take up too much room, and I &s;uppo&s;e there is but little Trading to the Northwards of that Latitude, &s;o that it would have been &s;el|dom in u&s;e, The&s;e Tables were calculated by my Fathers Tables.</P>
<P>He that &s;ails according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Projection, notes the true Quantity of Longitude in degrees and minutes, namely, &s;uch degrees as in that Parallel, 360 makes the Circumference. But they which &s;ail by <HI>Plano,</HI> mea&s;ure the Sea, which is round, as though it were a flat or plain, now it &s;tands to rea&s;on that there mu&s;t be great Difference: as thus,</P>
<P>All North and South Cour&s;es (which we call Meridians) inter&s;ect in the Poles: Now &s;uppo&s;e there be two Ships under the Aequinoctial, 5 degrees or 100 leagues a&s;under, and the&s;e Ships &s;ail both North, they will meet in the North Pole of the World, but by <HI>Plane</HI> they count them as far off there, as they were at fir&s;t, for all North and South Lines are parallel one to another, as you may &s;ee in the Work all along.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Illu&s;tration.</HEAD>
<P>All Meridian Lines (as I &s;aid before) cut through the Poles of the World, and all Parallel Lines go round about the Poles, continuing the &s;ame di&s;tance from them. The Aequinoctial is one of the&s;e Parallel Lines, drawn equally di&s;tant from the Poles, and &s;o is upon the body of the Earth; and there a degree of Longitude is 60 miles, and 360 times 60 miles is the Circum|ference of the Earth, which is 360 degrees.</P>
<PB N="159" REF="87">
<P>But now if there be a drawn Parallel, 50 degrees nearer to one of the Poles, our own rea&s;on will give that that Circle will not contain &s;o many miles round as the other did, be|cau&s;e it mu&s;t be le&s;s; yet he that &s;ails by <HI>Plano</HI> counts that it doth, and though he hath Winds that carry him no better than due North from the Aequinoctial to the Parallel or La|titude of 50 degrees, he counts he hath as many Leagues from the Meridian of the Place he is bound to, as he had when he was under the Aequinoctial. Now tell me how it is po&s;&s;ible, (if Meridians inter&s;ect in the Poles, as they do) that the&s;e Meridians &s;hould be as far a&s;under upon a Parallel of 50 de|grees nearer the Poles, as they were under the Aequinoctial: I hope you under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>It is the work of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rcator</HI> to &s;hew (therefore) the Quan|tity of a degree of Longitude in every Latitude, (for in the&s;e Parallels there is 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">0 degrees in the Circumference, but the&s;e degrees cannot contain &s;o many miles as they do nearer the Aequator) It &s;heweth how you may &s;ail upon any Cour&s;e from one Latitude to another, and reckon your Longitude according to the truth of it in degrees and minutes: So that having two things given be&s;ides the right Angle, you may find your de&s;ire at Sea according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s Direction, which is the &s;ure&s;t way of Sailing that I know, except Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, and that and this will agree in degrees of Longitude, but that &s;heweth the neare&s;t way to &s;ail from place to place, which is all that it differs from this, (they being both true) this &s;heweth a general way of &s;ailing from place to place, that a particular way of &s;ailing the neare&s;t way from place to place: It is but &s;eldom u&s;ed, becau&s;e it is not very commonly known, but it is an excellent thing, I thought to have touched it, but I con&s;idered that my Father hath demon&s;trated it as evidently as can be.

<P>I had thoughts to have &s;hewed the Difference between <HI>Plano</HI> and <HI>Mercator,</HI> in an Example, but my Father hath done it in page 170 of his Book. If you are de&s;irous to know Great Circle Sailing, you may learn it from his Book, for he hath treated of it largely; and indeed it is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary way of Sailing that is, for a man cuts his way much &s;horter (in many runs) than the u&s;ual way that men go, doth: If you de&s;ire to know in any Latitude the number of miles contained in any number of degrees of Longitude, convert your degrees and minutes of Longitude into minutes, and &s;ay,</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the foregoing Tables.</HEAD>
<P>HE that is bound to any place, the fir&s;t thing that he ought to con&s;ider is the Latitude of each place, and the Diffe|rence of Longitude between them, which things may be ta|ken from &s;uch a Catalogue as this is, after the manner fol|lowing.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I were bound from the <HI>Lizard</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I look in the Column of Latitude again&s;t the <HI>Lizard,</HI> and find 50 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> for its Latitude, and 25 <HI>deg.</HI> 20 <HI>min.</HI> for its Longitude, from <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves.</HI></P>
<P>I look in the Column of Latitude again&s;t <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and find 13 <HI>deg.</HI> 12 <HI>min.</HI> for its Latitude, and 327 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 <HI>min.</HI> for its Longitude from <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves.</HI></P>
<P>Here you have the Latitude of each place; but to find the Difference of Longitude between the&s;e places, I con&s;ider that <HI>Barbadoes</HI> hath 327 <HI>deg.</HI> 42 min. of Ea&s;t Longitude from the&s;e I&s;lands; but if I &s;ubtract that from 360 <HI>deg.</HI> (the whole Circum|ference) there mu&s;t remain the We&s;t Longitude that is between them, which I find to be 32 <HI>d</HI> 18 <HI>m.</HI></P>

<P>That Sum is 57 <HI>d.</HI> 38 <HI>m.</HI></P>
<P>The Difference of Longitude between the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Barba|does</HI> (the Meridian of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> being to the We&s;twards of the <HI>Lizard</HI> &s;o many degrees.)</P>
<P>And thus any Difference of Longitude between two places is taken; provided, that one of them is nearer than 19 <HI>deg.</HI> to the We&s;twards of the place you begin your Longitude from, and the other nearer than 90 <HI>deg.</HI> to the Ea&s;twards.</P>
<P>And the rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e the Longitude of all places is &s;et down from <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves</HI> to the Ea&s;twards; &s;o that if a place were but 1 <HI>deg.</HI> to the We&s;twards of <HI>Floures</HI> and <HI>Corves,</HI> it would be &s;et down in the Catalogue to lie in the 359 <HI>deg.</HI> of Longitude.</P>
<PB N="172" REF="94">
<P>For to know the Difference of Longitude between any two places, con&s;ider which way they are neare&s;t, and that take: Suppo&s;e there were two places, one lieth in 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> of Longitude, the other lieth in 195 <HI>deg.</HI> of Longitude: I con|&s;ider that the difference between them is not 180 <HI>deg.</HI> and therefore I will &s;ubtract 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 0 <HI>min.</HI> from 195 <HI>deg.</HI> and the Remainder is the Difference of Longitude between them 175 <HI>deg.</HI> but if the Difference between two places be above 180 <HI>deg.</HI> as they are laid down in the Catalogue: Subtract that difference from 360 <HI>deg.</HI> and the Remainder is the neare&s;t Dif|ference of Longitude: Your own rea&s;on will guide you in this, and therefore I will proceed.</P>

<P>Thus I have the two Latitudes, and the Difference of Longi|tude, to find the bearing of the place I am bound to: You may find it as is &s;hewed before, <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4. by bringing your Diffe|rence of Longitude into minutes, and taking the Meridional parts contained between the Latitude you are now in, and the Lati|tude of <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> and u&s;ing them as the &s;ides to work by.</P>

<HEAD>OF ASTRONOMY.</HEAD>
<P>I Had thoughts to have handled the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles fully, but if I &s;hould, I might do that which my Father hath done before, better than I can; the thing which induced me to this thought was that I might make the Application of it to Great Circle &s;ailing; but becau&s;e that way of &s;ailing (though the be&s;t) is &s;eldom u&s;ed, I have not &s;et it in my Book; if you de&s;ire to know it, you may &s;ee the way of it in my Fathers works, as plainly as (I think) it can po&s;&s;ibly be demon&s;trated by any man.</P>
<P>I have thought good to make u&s;e of his fundamental Axiom, to &s;hew how to re&s;olve tho&s;e Que&s;tions in the Sphere, which I have wrought in this Book by the Plain Scale, though I confe&s;s (for Amplitudes of Ri&s;ing and Setting, and Azimuths at certain given hours, with divers other things that are chiefly to be minded at Sea, for the Variation of the Compa&s;s, and other nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es) I hold the Plain Scale to be true enough, but that I conceive not to be &s;o &s;atisfactory to all men, and there|fore I have done this, the Axiom is this:
<Q>The Sine of a middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine Complement of the oppo&s;ite Extremes.</Q></P>
<PB N="186" REF="101">
<P>Now for Brevities &s;ake it is common to u&s;e the&s;e Characters, for this Character &plus; &s;ignifieth with Radius or more, or one Side or Angle with an another, for equal &equals;, for le&s;s &minus;; &s;o that the general Rule or fundamental Ob&s;ervation which we purpo&s;e to u&s;e, may be expre&s;&s;ed thus:</P>
<P>The Sine of the middle part &plus; Radius is &equals; to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine complement of the op|po&s;ite Extremes.</P>
<P>This Rule being rightly under&s;tood gives &s;uch full directi|ons, that a man may re&s;olve any Que&s;tion in the Sphere by it, which makes me judge tho&s;e culpable of a fault, that accu&s;e him of Prolixity, that made it in &s;o brief a manner. I will define a &s;pherical right angled Triangle, and &s;o come to the u&s;e of this Axiom.</P>
<P>In the &s;pherical right angled Tri|angle A B C, right angled at B, there are 5 things con&s;iderable, be&s;ide the right Angle, namely, the three Sides and the two Angles; the two Sides next to the right Angle are not no|ted to be Complements, but the Side A C, the Angle A, and the Angle C, is noted by their Complements to a Quadrant (which are the three things farthe&s;t from the right An|gle B.)
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of geometrical figure</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>If you have two things given be&s;ide the right Angle, to find a third (as you always have) the fir&s;t thing that you are to con&s;ider, is, whether it be an adjacent or an oppo&s;ite Ex|treme.</P>
<P>That is an adjacent Extreme, when the given parts and the required part joyn.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P><HI>For Example in Adjacent Extremes.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the given things were A C and A C B, and the re|quired thing were C B: Here you &s;ee that A C is joyning to C,
<PB N="187" REF="101"> and &s;o is C B, therefore they all joyn, and C is the middle part, for it is between B C and C A the Extremes.</P>
<P>That is an oppo&s;ite Extreme that hath two things lying to|gether, and the third thing lieth alone, and that part which lieth alone is the middle part.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the three things (namely the two given things, and the required thing) were B C, the Angle at A, and C A; then I conclude that C B is the middle part, and that it is an oppo|&s;ite Extreme, becau&s;e it is alone, and the other thing, namely, C A and A are together: If you ask how this can be, thus:</P>
<P>A C B is between C B and C A, and A B is between C B and the Angle at A, which proves that B C is alone, and A C and the Angle at A joyns: Then is A C and the Angle at A al&s;o the two Extremes.</P>
<P>Pray ob&s;erve this for a Rule, that the right Angle never parts any thing, for if C B, the Side B A, and the Angle at A be the three things, it is neverthele&s;s an adjacent Extreme; for though the right Angle be between the Sides B A, and B C, yet do not count that it parts them, (as another Angle would) &s;o as to make it an oppo&s;ite Extreme.</P>
<P>Or if the given and required things were the three Sides, you might judge B A the middle part, becau&s;e it is alone, for the Angle at A parts it from A C, and the right Angle at B is be|tween B C and it: Now never count that the right Angle at B parts B C from B A, but that they lie together, and A C lies alone, being parted by the Angle C from C B, and by the Angle A from A B, and &s;o is the middle part: The&s;e be the fir&s;t con&s;ide|rations (after you have a Que&s;tion &s;et you) that you ought to mind, without regarding which of the three things is given or required.</P>
<P>We now come to apply this general Axiom. Suppo&s;e I have the Side B C given, the Angle at C, and that the Side C A be required.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid I know C to be the middle part and that it is an adjacent Extreme; I will apply the Rule thus, it &s;aith
<PB N="188" REF="102"> the Sine of the middle part, which intimates that the middle part mu&s;t be always &s;o called, as you may take the Sine of it; now becau&s;e its noted to be a Complement, you mu&s;t call it Sine Complement, to find the Sine of it. This done, I will go to one of the Extremes, and con&s;ider what the Axiom &s;aith for that, (admit it be the Extreme C B) It &s;aith the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Ex|tremes adjacent; from whence I conclude, that I mu&s;t call C B &s;o, as that I may have the Tangent of it; Now C B is not noted to be a Complement, and therefore I call it Tangent C B. La&s;tly, for the other Extreme C A, for the &s;ame rea&s;on I mu&s;t call it &s;o, as that I may take the Tangent of it: and becau&s;e it is noted to be a Complement, therefore I call it Tangent Com|plement, to have the Tangent of it: Now as I go along thus in my thoughts, I will &s;et it down as I con&s;ider it, and it frames this Rule:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Sine com.</HI> C &plus; <HI>Radius is &equals; to Tang.</HI> C B &plus; <HI>Tang. comp.</HI> C A.</Q></P>
<P>My Que&s;tion being brought into this order, I will con&s;ider which is given and which is required: tho&s;e which are given, I will &s;et down fir&s;t, the thing required undermo&s;t, and look for them in the Tables by the directions which I have framed from the Axiom.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>And thus this Axiom &s;ets your bu&s;ine&s;s in order; but now that you may know when to take a Complement arithmetical, or let it a lone; and al&s;o, that you may know which thing it is that you mu&s;t take the Complement arithmetical of, ob&s;erve this Rule, either in adjacent or oppo&s;ite Extremes.</P>
<P>That if the middle part and an extreme be given, take the Complement arithmetical of the given Extreme; but if the two Extremes be given, to find the middle part, take no Complement arithmetical at all: This may be &s;ufficient for all Que&s;tions in
<PB N="189" REF="102"> right angled Triangles, will fall out one of the&s;e two ways; this Complement arithmetical is what every figure in the Tables wants of 9: it was fir&s;t invented by my Father, it &s;aves a labour of Subtracting, and &s;o abbreviates the work much.</P>
<P>To many which I have taught, it hath &s;eemed &s;trange that a thing is called Sine comp. or Tan. comp. (when one is to find the Sine or Tangent of it) but the rea&s;on of it is this; if a thing be a Complement already (as three things in every right angled &s;pherical Triangle is noted to be) the comp. of that Comple|ment mu&s;t be the Sine or Tangent of that Complement.</P>
<P>But pray mind me; I have noted that there are five things in every right angled Triangle con&s;iderable, be&s;ides the right Angle.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve this for a Rule, (when you are framing your Rule from the general Axiom to work by) that if you call any of the&s;e five things by their names, you &s;hall not have the Com|plements of them, but call any of them out of their names, and you &s;hall; I mean thus. Suppo&s;e you have a mind to take the Sine of A B, it is noted not to be a Complement, therefore call it Sine A B, to have the Sine of it, or Tangent A B to have the Tangent of it, the like for C B.</P>
<P>Again, if you have a mind to take the Sine of C A, I con&s;ider that C A is noted by the name of a Complement, call it Sine comp. &s;o &s;hall you have the Sine of it, or Tangent Complement, and you &s;hall have the Tangent of it; the like for the two Angles contrariwi&s;e: If you have occa&s;ion to take the Complements of them, call them out of their names.</P>
</DIV2>

<P><HI>Example in oppo&s;ite Extremes.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e A B be given, and B C, and the Side A C be required.</P>
<P>From what hath be &s;aid, I con&s;ider this is an oppo&s;ite Ex|treme, and that A C is the middle part; (for that is alone) call A C Sine Complement to find the Sine of it: and becau&s;e the Axiom &s;aith, that the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is &equals; to the Sines Complement of the oppo&s;ite Extremes (for the former Rea&s;ons) call A B Sine comp. and B C Sine comp. which is out of their names, and you have this Rule:</P>

<P>Suppo&s;e it were A B and A C that were given, to find the Angle at C; this is oppo&s;ite Extreme, and A B is the middle part, call A B (the middle part) Sine, (which is by its name) to find the Sine of it, and A C, and the Angle at A out of their names (which is Sine A C, and Sine A) to find the Sine Com|plement of them, and thus for any el&s;e.</P>
