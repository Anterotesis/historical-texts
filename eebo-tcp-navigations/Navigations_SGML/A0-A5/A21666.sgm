<P>_WHere the auncient entercour&s;e of marchaundizes betwixt our Countries and the lowe Countries of the kyng of Spayne our good brother, hath ben of late interrupted by &s;undrye prohibitions made in the &s;ayde lowe Countries, a&s;well agayn&s;t the carying of the commodities of our Realme into tho&s;e par|ties, as for the bryngyng certeyne commodities of tho&s;e lowe Countries, and many other, through the &s;ame into this our Realme, wherby at the beginning &s;uch hyndraunce appeared lykely to en&s;ue to the &s;ubiectes on both partes, as it was motioned and thought mete by vs both that a metyng and dyet &s;hould be deui&s;ed and accorded within &s;ome conuenient tyme, for the redre&s;&s;e of &s;uche matters as were pretended to be the cau&s;es of the &s;ayd prohibitions. And nowe by proces of tyme it is become manife&s;t that although the fore&s;aid prohibitions were of theyr owne nature hurtfull to the &s;ubiectes on both parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, &s;o as therof depended an expectation of a redre&s;&s;e for both our &s;ubiectes: yet the v&s;age and maner of execution of the &s;ame prohibitions, on the other &s;yde, do nowe directly and notoriou&s;ly benefite and enriche only the &s;ubiectes and inhabitauntes of the &s;aid lowe Countries, and directly and notoriou&s;ly hurt &amp; iniurie our proper &s;ubiectes, not only by the playne &s;toppyng and re&s;traynyng of our marchauntes from theyr aun|cient trade accu&s;tomed into tho&s;e Countries: but by the continuall hauntyng into our Realme of them only of the lowe Countrie, and by &s;tuffyng and burdenyng our Realme with all &s;uperfluous and vnnedefull wares euen contrary to theyr owne prohibitions, and con&s;equently by carying away the trea&s;ure &amp; monyes out of our Realme. For although by generall wordes of their prohibitions, the wollen clothes of our Realme are vtterly forbydden to be brought thyther, vpon a pretence of infection, and lykewy&s;e other commodities wherevpon our handycraftes people &s;houlde labour, be &s;trayghtly forbydden to be brought hither by any per|&s;on out of the &s;ayde lowe Countries: Notwith&s;tanding it is well knowen, that the greater part of tho&s;e com|modities, come originally from hygh Almayne and other Remote Countries, and haue as it were but theyr pa&s;&s;age through tho&s;e lowe Countries, yet a great number of people of the &s;ame lowe Countries, eyther as contempnyng theyr owne prohibitions, or hauyng by &s;peciall labour &s;ome &s;ecrete licences, do dayly carry, as they haue all this &s;ommer al&s;o v&s;ed to do, all &s;uch clothes, without any &s;cruple of infection, as they can by any meanes with fauour, and &s;ometyme without knowledge of officers, obteyne to be tran&s;ported out of our Realme, and lykewy&s;e cea&s;&s;e not to bryng great quantities of all kynde of wares, and &s;pecially &s;uche as are mo&s;t &s;uperfluous into this our Realme, returnyng for the &s;ame, as experience doth proue, monyes and plate from hence in all the &s;ecrete&s;t maner that they can. Whervpon although we haue borne herewith very long, yet nowe we are nece&s;&s;aryly compelled to prouide &s;pedye remedye for our louyng &s;ubiectes, accordyng to the naturall care whiche we are bounde to haue of the publique e&s;tate of our &s;ayde &s;ubiectes, in matters &s;o manife&s;tly &s;ought to vndo them. For the reliefe wherof, we are al&s;o daily &s;ued vnto by the company of our marchantes aduenturers, who haue not &s;hipped any clothes out of this Realme, as they were accu&s;tomed, into tho&s;e lowe Countries, by the &s;pace of the&s;e thirtene monethes, being therby &s;ore charged with y^e com|modities remaynyng vpon their handes: That although vpon long expectation of &s;ome common order to be taken betwixt vs and the coun&s;ell of our good brother rulyng for hym in the &s;ayd lowe Countries, they haue to their great charges, remayned without trading any kinde of marchaundizes, eyther into, or out of tho&s;e Countries: yet it myght plea&s;e vs to haue compa&s;&s;ion of them, and to permit them with our fauour, and without further delay, to cary their clothes which were &s;hipped fiue monethes pa&s;&s;ed, into &s;ome other places and countries mete for them, con&s;ideryng they &s;ee nother libertie, nor &s;uertie to re&s;ort into the low Countries, as they were accu&s;tomed. And further, that this vnordinate v&s;age of the Marchauntes of the

And next, we do ordeyne and &s;trayghtly charge and co~maunde, that vntyll the&s;e late great di&s;orders and interruptions of the entercour&s;e by the&s;e prohibitions, and &s;pecially by the notable parciall mi&s;v&s;age therof &s;halbe refourmed and repayred (wherevnto for our parte we are &s;o wyllyng as we wyl refu&s;e no rea&s;onable meanes) no maner commoditie, wares, or marchaundizes, growing, wrought, or prouided in the &s;ayd lowe Countries, or co~myng through the &s;ame, &s;halbe from the publication hereof, by any maner of per&s;on, tran&s;ported from the &s;ayde lowe Countries, hyther into this our Realme, or into any Port or Creke therof, vpon payne of forfaiture of the &s;ame, the one halfe therof to vs, and the other to any per&s;on that &s;hall geue due information therof eyther to our priuie coun&s;ell, or into our Exchequer, as other informations are geuen, within two monethes after the offence committed agayn&s;te this our Procla|mation.</P>
