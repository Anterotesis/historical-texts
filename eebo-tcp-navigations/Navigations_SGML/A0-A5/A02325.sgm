PVBLICATION
OF GVIANA'S
PLANTATION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To all faithfull, and well affected Chri&s;tians.</HEAD>
<P>_FOR as much as diver&s;e of this
Nation are departed hence into
forraine Countries, as well for
the propagating of Gods truth
(mo&s;t likely) as their owne pri|vate
benefite, whereby the word
of the Lord might bee fulfilled in tho&s;e Heathen
(through Gods infinite goodnes &amp; mercy) as in us
Chri&s;tians formerly &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 25. 26.</NOTE> <HI>I will call them my people
which were not my people, and her beloved, which was
not beloved, and it &s;hall be in the place where it was &s;aid
unto them, yee are not my people, that there they &s;hall be
called the children of the living God.</HI> Neither is it to be
doubted, but that there are divers yet remaining,
which retaine the like Chri&s;tian re&s;olution, but
<PB N="2" REF="3">
want of true knowledge of a plantation (that may
proove profitable to the Church of God &amp; them|them&s;elves)
cau&s;eth &s;uch to live heere like plants,
which many times prove le&s;&s;e fruitfull in their na|turall
&s;oile, then when they are removed to places
better liking them, for which cau&s;e I have thought
good at this pre&s;ent, to di&s;cover briefly (to all &s;uch
as are wel affected) the knowledge of a mo&s;t hope|full
plantation newly undertaken by the right
honorable the Earle of <HI>Barke&s;hire</HI> (Knight of the
mo&s;t noble order of the Garter) and compa|ny,
for that famous river of the <HI>Amazones</HI> in
<HI>America,</HI> as by that which followeth may ap|peare.</P>
<P>But before I proceede further herein, I thinke it
not ami&s;&s;e to &s;peake &s;omewhat of the lawfullne&s;&s;e
of plantations in forraine countries, whereby &s;uch
as make doubt thereof, may be beetter &s;atisfied
herewith.</P>
<P>Now in plantations there are the&s;e two princi|palls
to be con&s;idered: fir&s;t, whether it be lawfull
to remove from one place or countrey to another,
&s;econdly, whether it be lawfull to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e a coun|trey
already inhabited by others: touching the for|mer
it hath the&s;e two &s;everall heads, namely, ordi|nary,
and extraordinary; extraordinary is that
when God &s;hall plea&s;e immediately to cau&s;e any
man to depart from one country to another, as hee
cau&s;ed <HI>Abraham</HI> to depart from <HI>Haran</HI> to <HI>Canaan</HI>
and <HI>Iacob</HI> to returne from <HI>Padan Aram</HI> to the land
of his fathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 12. 1, 4, 5, 31. 3. 18.</NOTE> but no man may now expect any
<PB N="3" REF="3">
&s;uch removall and calling as the&s;e formerly
had.</P>
<P>The latter of the&s;e which I call ordinary, is that
when men &s;hall be either moved them&s;elves, or by
others to leave their ancient habitation, and goe
and inhabite &s;ome other place: and this I take to be
warrantable from that place of the Kings, where the
children of the Prophets &s;aid unto <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> &rindx; <HI>Behold
now, the place where wee dwell with thee is too narrow
for us, Let us goe now to Iordan that wee may take thence
every man a beame, and make us a place to dwell in; and
hee an&s;wered goe, and one &s;aid, vouch&s;afe I pray thee to
goe with thy &s;ervants, and hee &s;aid I will, goe &s;o he went
with them, and when they came to Iordan they cut downe
wood.</HI> Which worke of theirs (without que&s;tion)
was no other to them then a new plantation, for
they &s;eing the inconvenience that was like to en&s;ue
by &s;taying longer in their ancient habitation, did
thereupon remove to a place more &s;pacious, and
commodious for them. &rindx; In which progre&s;&s;e of
theirs, wee may learne not to conceale any thing to
our &s;elves, which may as well prove profittable
to others, but di&s;cover the &s;ame for their good, as
doubtle&s;&s;e the Children of the Prophets heere
did.</P>
<P>From hence then wee may gather, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">
men may lawfully remoove with their fami|lyes
from one place to another, and that for
divers cau&s;es; as here the Children of the
Prophets did, by rea&s;on of the &s;traitne&s;&s;e of the
land wherein they dwelt: and it is to be feared that
<PB N="4" REF="4">
many al&s;o among us have as great cau&s;e to doe the
like, by rea&s;on of the daily increa&s;ing of all &s;orts of
people, whereby cittyes townes and countries, are
&s;o thronged, that men can hardly live well one by
another, appeareth by the generall complaint of
many in the&s;e times.</P>
<P>Neither hath the &s;ayd &s;traitne&s;&s;e alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 8. 1, 2.</NOTE> cau&s;ed
a removall from one place or Country to another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruth. 4. 1. 2.</NOTE>
but al&s;o <HI>famine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chro. 10. 7.</NOTE> <HI>&s;word,</HI> and <HI>other alterations,</HI> happen|ning
in the world:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 14. 18.</NOTE> And to &s;peake truely, if that &s;ome
in all ages had not departed into other countries
with their families (as God was plea&s;ed to moove
them by his divine providence) the world a&s;&s;ured|ly
had not beene &s;o much inhabited abroad as now
it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 37, 38.</NOTE> and men had beene more burthened at home,
then now they are: therefore &s;uch men de&s;erve ra|ther
to be commended, then condemned by any, &rindx;
&amp; that becau&s;e they do nothing herein, but what
God hath commanded, to be done, as appeareth
<HI>Gen.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9. 1.</NOTE> 1. 28. <HI>Bring forth fruit and multiply and fill the
earth:</HI> and this againe is ratified, to <HI>Noah</HI> and his
&s;ons, &s;aying, <HI>bring forth fruite and multiply and reple|ni&s;h
the earth,</HI> which places, being no way contradi|cted
in all the &s;criptures (as I coulde ever perceive)
are &s;ufficient to proove the Lawfulne&s;&s;e of plan|tations
in all ages. And the rather, when Kings &s;hal
bee likewi&s;e plea&s;ed to allow the &s;ame freedome
to their naturall &s;ubiects, and that not onely to the
poore, but al&s;o to the rich, who have the like privi|ledge
of removal, as appeareth by the places before
mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 13. 2, 5, 6, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and by that of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot,</HI> who
departed one from the other, becau&s;e the Land
<PB N="5" REF="4">
wherein they dwelt were &s;o &s;trait that it could not
beare them, by rea&s;on their &s;ub&s;tance was &s;o great.</P>
<P>So then wee &s;ee all men have a like liberty of
removing from one place to another, excepting
&s;uch onely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 7.</NOTE> which for the time being have any <HI>of|fice,</HI>
or &s;hall bee <HI>married,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7. 5.</NOTE> in which ca&s;e men ought
not to depart from their wives without con&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. 7.</NOTE>
nor <HI>children</HI> from their parents without their liking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colo. 5. 20. 22.</NOTE>
nor <HI>&s;ervants</HI> from their Ma&s;ters without their
leave.</P>
<P>It remayneth in the next place, that I &s;hew the
lawfulne&s;&s;e of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a countrey already inhabi|ted
by others, which is our &s;econd que&s;tion:</P>
<P>True it is, that all men through Adams fall were
deprived of the glory of God, and worlds good,
until by Chri&s;t the u&s;e of the creatures was againe
re&s;tored to all beleevers, therfore the right of that
which we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, commeth now to us by Chri&s;t,
for which cau&s;e, the heathen have no right to that
which they deeme theirs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 115. 16.</NOTE> notwith&s;tanding, the
Lord hath beene plea&s;ed to &s;uffer &s;uch to live on
earth with his,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 32.</NOTE> and not to be rooted out from the
place of their habitations untill the day of harve&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ay. 27. 13.</NOTE>
during which time the Land wherein &s;uch have li|ved
hath beene called theirs:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 32. 21</NOTE> <HI>As the land of the Phi|listims,
the land of Egipt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 37. 7.</NOTE> <HI>and of A&s;hur,</HI> of whom it is
&s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ay 13. 14.</NOTE> that he returned with &s;hame &rindx; <HI>to his owne land,</HI>
and of the Egyptians it is &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ay. 19. 17.</NOTE> <HI>they &s;hall returne

of <HI>Iudea</HI> and I&s;rael,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 44. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> being taken from the Heathen
(by Gods &s;peciall command and a&s;&s;i&s;tance) was
afterward called &rindx; <HI>their owne Land:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 36. 17.</NOTE> for as the
<PB N="6" REF="5">
I&s;raelites land was not the heathens as &s;aith the Pro|phet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;a. 14. 1.</NOTE>

land the I&s;raelites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 24. 37.</NOTE> as God telleth <HI>Abraham;</HI>
&s;aying, <HI>know for a &s;uretie that thy &s;eed &s;hall bee a &s;tran|ger
in a land &rindx; that is not theirs;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 15. 13.</NOTE> from whence we
may gather, that God permitteth not his to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e
a people or nation of their ancient habita|tion
for the enlarging of their owne borders; ne|verthele&s;&s;e,
if &s;uch &s;hall bee willing that Gods
people &s;hall inhabit with them, as <HI>Abimelech</HI> was
willing <HI>that Abraham &s;hould dwell with him in his land
where it plea&s;ed him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 20. 15. &amp; 47. 5. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>Pharaoh</HI> liked well <HI>that Ia|cob
and his &s;onnes &s;hould dwell with him in the be&s;t of
the land of Egypt.</HI> In &s;uch a ca&s;e men may doubtle&s;&s;e
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e a country already inhabited by others:</P>
<P>&rindx; But the inhabitants of <HI>Guiana</HI> are willing that
our nation &s;hould inhabit that goodly and &s;patious
country with them (as appeareth more fully in
Mr. <HI>Harcourts</HI> relation of <HI>Guiana</HI> dedicated to the
Kings mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;tie, 1626) Therefore
without all que&s;tion, the plantations there made of
late by our nation are lawfull.</P>
<P>Thus having briefly &s;hewed the lawfullne&s;&s;e of
plantations in forraine Countries, for the better
&s;ati&s;f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of &s;uch as make doubt thereof, I come in
the next place to &s;peake &s;omewhat of the nature of
the river, qualitie of the land, climate, and people
of <HI>Guiana,</HI> with the provi&s;ion for mans &s;u&s;tenance,
and commodities therein growing, whereby &s;uch
as are ignorant of the &s;ame, might bee encouraged
to adventure for the good of them&s;elves, and of
<PB N="7" REF="5">
tho&s;e poore natives, which &s;it &s;till in darkne&s;&s;e,
and in the &s;hadow of death.</P>
<P>As touching that great and famous River of the
<HI>Amazones</HI> in <HI>America,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Harcort.</NOTE> it is called for the excel|lencie
thereof, (by <HI>Io&s;epus A co&s;ta)</HI> the Empre&s;&s;e
and Queene of all Flouds, and for the large extent
of the &s;ame, it is called by others the &s;weet Sea,
&s;uppo&s;ed to bee the greate&s;t River (not onely of
all <HI>India,</HI> but al&s;o) of the whole world; it is &s;aid
to &s;low from the Mountaines of <HI>Peru,</HI> and runneth
with many windings and turnings for the &s;pace of
1500 leagues, containing at the mouth thereof
neare &s;ixtie leagues in breadth; in it are many I|lands,
divers of which are inhabited by the Indi|ans;
it doth ebbe and flow neare three hundred
leagues, and hath in it greate &s;tore of excellent fi|&s;hes
for the u&s;e of man: of which more &s;hall bee
&s;aid hereafter, when wee &s;hall come to &s;peake of
the provi&s;ions of the country for mans &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>The quality of the land is of divers kindes; as
low, middle, and mountainous, (as here with us)
it aboundeth in woods of divers &s;orts, having
plaines in &s;ome parts thereof, with plentie of gra&s;&s;e,
be&s;ides plea&s;ant &s;treames of fre&s;h waters, all which
are very needfull and fitting for a plantation.</P>
<P>The earth in tho&s;e parts is of &s;undry mixtures,
as blacke mould, clay, ro&s;&s;ey, and &s;uch like, be|&s;ides
&s;tone for building if occa&s;ion &s;erve.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;ons there differ much from ours, for the
dry weather which wee call there &s;ummer, be|ginneth
about <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the raines and windes,
which we account there winter, begin about <HI>Februa|rie;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
which latter &s;ea&s;on is termed by us their win|ter,
by rea&s;on of the raines then falling extraordi|narie,
and not by rea&s;on of the coldne&s;&s;e of the
weather; for there are no fro&s;tes or &s;nowes, as
with us here, &rindx; but a continuall &s;pring and &s;um|mer
&s;ea&s;on: for no &s;ooner doe the leaves wither
and fall away, but pre&s;ently it beginnes to &s;pring
againe, as here with us &s;ome yeares it &s;eemeth the
like; for when our autumme proves &s;omewhat
warme, then commonly appeareth a &s;econd &s;pring,
which yet never commeth to perfection, and that
by rea&s;on of the &s;uns declining from our horizon,
and the cold winters pre&s;ent approaching, which
cau&s;eth alwayes our latter &s;pring to keepe backe,
untill the time of our &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on: &rindx; which in
<HI>Guiana</HI> is not &s;o, for there is little difference of
heat and cold throughout the yeare, but a mo&s;t
plea&s;ant growing weather, which commonly cau|&s;eth
tho&s;e parts to bee much more fruitfull then
many other parts of the world.</P>
<P>&rindx; The day and night are there alwaies equall, the
Sunne ri&s;ing at &s;ix of the clocke in the morning,
and &s;etting at &s;ix in the evening or neare therea|bout
the yeare throughout.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions for diet are many, as fir&s;t, the
roote called Ca&s;&s;avie, of which the <HI>Guianians</HI>
make their bread; there is likewi&s;e a kinde of great
wheat called Maix, it yeeldeth great increa&s;e, and
maketh excellent meale, or flower for bread: of
the afore&s;aid Ca&s;&s;avie, and this wheat, is made a
&s;ort of drinke called Paranaw, much like the be&s;t
march beare here with us; other &s;orts al&s;o they
<PB N="9" REF="6">
have, which for brevity &s;ake I omit here to &s;peake
of.</P>
<P>There are Deere of divers &s;orts, wilde Swine,
Hares and Conies in great plenty, be&s;ides which
there is a great bea&s;t called Maipnry which in ta&s;te
is like beefe, and will take &s;alt; there is al&s;o ano|ther
creature which u&s;ually commeth into the fre&s;h
waters, and feedeth upon the gra&s;&s;e and weedes in
the mar&s;hes, (and is called by us the &s;ea-Cow) be+ing
in ta&s;t like beefe, and will al&s;o take &s;alt, as the
former; of the&s;e there are great &s;tore in their &s;ea|&s;ons,
they wil &s;erve wel for the victualling of &s;hips
homeward bound, as of late hath beene proved.</P>
<P>Of fowles there be divers kindes, namely, wild-duckes,
wilde-gee&s;e, hennes, herons, cranes, &s;torkes,
phea&s;ants, partridges, pigeons, &s;tockdoves, parrats
of &s;undry &s;orts, be&s;ides ravenous fowles, and
hawkes, with divers other &s;orts not knowne in
the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The variety of fi&s;h is great, as fir&s;t, mullet, &s;ea|breame,
&s;oale, &s;cate, thornebacke, &s;wordfi&s;h, &s;eale,
a fi&s;h like a &s;ammon, but differing in coulour,
&s;hrimpes, lob&s;ters, and oy&s;ters, other &s;orts there
are, be&s;ides fre&s;hwater fi&s;h of many kindes, which
in the&s;e parts of <HI>Europe</HI> are not knowne to us.</P>
<P>The fruites there growing are the Pina, Planta|na,
Medler, Plumbes and Nuts of divers kindes, be|&s;ide
&s;tore of Potatoes, as for the Pina, it exceedeth
all other fruites in tho&s;e parts, being in ta&s;te much
like ripe &s;traberries with clarret wine and &s;ugar; the
Plantana ta&s;teth like an old pippin, the medlers
exceede ours in greatne&s;&s;e, and the nuts in &s;weet|ne&s;&s;e.</P>

<P>Now &s;eeing that the hope of worldly gaine cau|&s;eth
mo&s;t men to adventure in one kinde or other,
and that the gaine conceived of this plantation may
prove very profitable both to the Church of God
and all adventurers, it may therefore the better in|courage

herein, &rindx; and chiefly &s;uch as have recei|ved
of the Lord both grace, and ability, for the fur|ther
&s;etting forth of his glory.</P>
<P>And although it cannot bee denied but that our
nation of late yeares, hath beene very forward in
&s;etling of divers plantations beyond the &s;eas,
yet have they not all thereby &s;o much glorified
God, as could be wi&s;hed, nor dealt &s;o faithfully
with &s;ome adventurers, as was expected, which
thing no doubt being con&s;idered by many, hath
beene the onely cau&s;e of keeping them backe from
being adventurers; and no marvell, if when wee
con&s;ider the per&s;ons commonly &s;ent (I &s;peake not
of all, but of &s;uch onely) who&s;e lives being ba&s;e
and idle here at home, can hardly bee expected to
be much better abroade in forraigne plantations,
which to &s;peake truely, have beene no other (for
<PB N="14" REF="9">
the mo&s;t part formerly) then common &s;inkes,
wherein too many grieved fathers have ca&s;t forth
their de&s;perate of&s;pring, and the commonwealth
her mo&s;t lawle&s;&s;e inhabitants, &s;uch as by their con|ver&s;ations
cau&s;e the good name whereby they are
called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 2. 12.</NOTE> to be rather <HI>evil &s;poken of among&s;t the Gentiles,</HI>
then otherwi&s;e: by meanes whereof it hath happe|ned
that the heathen have deemed that God as evil
as their owne, who&s;e &s;ervants were wor&s;e then
them&s;elves, doth not God and nature teach, that
<HI>what&s;oever a man &s;oweth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 7.</NOTE> <HI>that &s;hall hee al&s;o reape, not
grapes of thornes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 7. 16</NOTE> <HI>nor figgs of thi&s;tles</HI> can men expect.
And now, though plantes of grace (like fruitfull
trees) are chiefe&s;t to be wi&s;hed for in al plantations,
yet no doubt may civill men be &s;ent in ca&s;e of want,
as natures flowers for ornament: I wi&s;h therefore
that care were had, &rindx; to &s;end tho&s;e plants, and
leave the bad.</P>
<P>As for the temper of the climate it exceedeth not
&s;o in heate as &s;ome men have thought of it, for
though the &s;cituation be in part under the equino|ctial,
yet is it habitable, as appeareth by the experi|ence
of our countrimen, which have lived in tho&s;e
parts, and found it both healthfull, and plea&s;ant; for
God in wi&s;dome hath &s;o ordered the heavens in
their horizon, as that by meanes of a brieze (or
fre&s;h gale of winde) blowing in the day time, it
quallifieth the heate, &rindx; and maketh the climate
much more temperate, as with us is often felt the
like in heate of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the dewes there falling commonly in the
night, addeth much to the cooling of that climate,
<PB N="15" REF="9">
and which is to bee noted, the continuall ab&s;ence
of the Sunne from the horizon, for the &s;pace of
twelve houres every day, cannot but cau&s;e the
temper of that clymate to be moderate, there be|ing
a perfect mixture of heat and cold, each qua|lifing
the other in the &s;pace of twentie foure hours
by an equall divi&s;ion of day and night, as before
hath beene &s;hewed.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are built (mo&s;t commonly) in
length, like our barnes here with us, &s;ome of which
are &s;o large, as that they containe in them above an
hundred per&s;ons, having therein hanging beds, (in
which they lie) called hamackoes, made of cotten
woll very artificially, their ve&s;&s;els for u&s;e are
made &s;ome of clay, of which &s;ort &s;ome are &s;o great
as that they will containe more then one hog&s;head
of water.</P>
<P>They will worke a month or more for an axe of
eighteene or twentie pence price; for which they
will fell your timber, cleare your ground, plant
your &s;ugar-canes, Anotto, and Cotten trees, and
build your hou&s;e after their fa&s;hion: &rindx; which in
other plantations is not &s;o, for in all other our
plantations, the adventurers are enforced to car|ry
men over to doe their worke for them, lea&s;t o|therwi&s;e
they bee driven to worke them&s;elves, as
Virginia, St. Chri&s;tophers, and new England;
with others can witne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides which, in mo&s;t former plantations except
new England, men have adventured onely upon
hope of one commoditie (as namely Tobacco) but
here are many more commodities then one, (as
<PB N="16" REF="10">
hath beene &s;hewed) &rindx; therefore is this plantati|on
more hopefull then all others: the foundation
of which being already laid, may give men better
incouragment to become ioynt adventurers here|in,
e&s;pecially being thereupon pre&s;ently intre&s;&s;ed
in the &s;hipping &s;tocke, and profits of the &s;aid plan|tation;
for the pre&s;ervation whereof, wee have
not onely &s;ent divers hone&s;t and able men (mar|ren

with amunition, and other materials very
u&s;efull towards building of a fort, for the better
&s;ecuring of our planters per&s;ons from the danger
of an enemy; having moreover cau&s;ed a pinnace
to bee &s;ent to abide with the Colony in the river,
for their better &s;afetie and trade in the country;
&rindx; intending likewi&s;e this &s;ummer (if God &s;hall

(as artificers and others) be&s;ides women, as al&s;o
more ordnance, amunition, and other materials,
fitting for the defence of the plantation, be&s;ides
another &s;hipp, greater then the former, to &s;tay and

for their better defence and trade in the country a|fore&s;aid:
in which &s;upply I al&s;o purpo&s;e (God

and divers goodly rivers be&s;ides in the country)
wee may (if we plea&s;e) goe further out of their
reach, where no doubt (through Gods a&s;&s;i&s;ting
of our indeavours) wee may come to returne as
great profit (by meanes of &s;ugar canes and &s;uch
like commodities growing in tho&s;e partes) as in the
river afore&s;aid: for to &s;peake truly, it were great
weakne&s;&s;e in any to pre&s;ume to &s;it neare an enemy,
and have not &s;ufficient &s;trength to oppo&s;e him, or
having roome enough to go out of his reach, will
notwith&s;tanding abide neare him; yet I deny not,
but that a Colony may bee able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t neare an
enemy by meanes of fortification, and e&s;pecially
when they are &s;uch as feare God, being provided
with amunition, victuall, and all other things need|full
for the defence of the &s;ame: for to rai&s;e a fort
for the reliefe of a Colony, and not to victuall it,
(as &s;ome haue carele&s;ly neglected through indi&s;cre|tion)
were to make it (with &s;uch) our peoples
<PB N="18" REF="11">
grave, and not their pre&s;ervation: and if an hun|dred
of our nation, or thereabout (having nei|ther
fort, nor artillery for defence,) were able (not
long &s;ince) by meanes of the natives, to cau&s;e a|bout
eighteene hundred of the enemy to retrayte,
and abandon the river, with lo&s;&s;e of many of their

fitted with all things needfull for the defence of the
&s;ame, may wee bee better able, (through the helpe
of the almighty) to repell and beat backe a more
potent power.</P>
<P>Now as the rai&s;ing of forts for the defence
of Colonies, and neglect of &s;toring them with
victuall, and other things needfull for pre&s;ervati|on
of the &s;ame, &s;heweth the great indi&s;cretion of
&s;ome &s;ort of people: &rindx; So in like manner, is
their folly as great, who looking after pre&s;ent
profit, neglect planting provi&s;ions needfull for
the pre&s;ervation of their lives: which wee taking
into con&s;ideration, have given expre&s;&s;e charge,

needfull for &s;u&s;tentation, whereby they may bee
