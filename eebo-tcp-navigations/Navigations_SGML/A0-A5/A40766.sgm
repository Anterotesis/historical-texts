<P>SINCE my la&s;t, it's &s;aid, The Drum that came to the General, was an An&s;wer to a Me&s;&s;age, &s;ent by the General, about Exchange of Pri&s;o|ners on the <HI>24th.</HI> This Morning about the Hour of Six, the Drum returned from the Enemies Quarters; all our Hands (that can any ways po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from other Du|ty,) are mending the Tin Boats; and our Men are working, with all diligence, in rai&s;ing of three New Batteries, one below the Bridge, another above it; and the third without the Town-Wall, by the River-&s;ide, oppo&s;ite to a large Ba&s;tion, the Enemy have erected, on the other &s;ide the River <HI>Shannon,</HI> which is there not &s;o broad as the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> between <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hor&s;e Ferry,</HI> and <HI>Lambeth</HI> at Low-Water.</P>
<P>About Seaven of the Clock this Evening, one of the Granadeers belonging to the Lord <HI>Lisburn</HI>'s Regiment going under &s;ome Arches of the Bridge of <HI>Athlone,</HI> to look for Plunder among&s;t the Enemies Dead, found a pair of Colours, belonging to a Company of the Earl of <HI>Clanrickard</HI>'s Regiment; which were
<PB REF="2" MS="y">on the Breach when we Stormed the Town, and brought them off flying to the General; and though, I believe, 100 Shot were made at him, yet none hurt him: The Lord Ba|ron <HI>Ginkle,</HI> our General, very generou&s;ly Rewarded him with Five Guineas. The <HI>25th.</HI> ye&s;terday the Enemy were very hard at work, in rai&s;ing two new Batteries above the Ca&s;tle; the one clo&s;e by the River &s;ide, the other on a ri&s;ing ground, a di&s;tance from it; and about Eight of the Clock la&s;t Night they were fini&s;hed, one of them are of four, the other of three, &s;ix Pounders, with the latter of which, they have played briskly on the old Walls of the Town, where our Men are, (but without killing, or wound|ing any;) with the other, they &s;hot into &s;ome of our Regiments, who lay Encamp'd on the Bank of the River, which obliged our Men to Decamp, and remove farther off.</P>
<P>About this Morning, our Battery (below the Bridge) was fini&s;hed, and 26 four Pound|ers planted thereon, which has ever &s;ince Six this Morning, played ince&s;&s;antly on the Enemies Brea&s;t-work, on the other &s;ide, by which, mo&s;t of the &s;aid Brea&s;t-work is beat down and levelled with the ground; as al&s;o, mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es that &s;tood on the other &s;ide the Town; by which means, the Ene|mies Works are &s;o much expo&s;ed to our view, that they are forced to quit the Town, a great part or them retiring to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk"></HI>'s Camp, others retiring behind the Ca&s;tle, and in the Work over the Bridge, which in a few hours, from our upper Battery, will be &s;oon likewi&s;e ruined, and it's not doubt|ed, but that very &s;oon we may acquaint you, that we are Ma&s;ters of the River, and Ruined Town of <HI>Athlone:</HI> Our Guns are now firing very furiou&s;ly from all our Bat|teries, with very good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
