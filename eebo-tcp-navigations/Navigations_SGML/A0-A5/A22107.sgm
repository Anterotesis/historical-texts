</FIGURE> &leaf; By the King. &leaf; A Proclamation prohibiting the Merchant Aduenturers Charter from henceforth to be put in practi&s;e or execution, either within the Kingdome, or beyond the Seas.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_AS there is no great action, which tendeth to the aduancement of a</HI> publique good, but it requireth certaine degrees of timely proceeding, and neuerthele&s;&s;e meeteth with diuers impediments; &s;ome by accident, and &s;ome by practi&s;e: So is there nothing that doeth more adorne the true Maie&s;tie and greatne&s;&s;e of Soueraigne Princes, then to be con|&s;tant in their wel-grounded Re&s;olutions, and by their policie and law|full power, to &s;catter and beat downe all difficulties, and vndue oppo&s;i|tions, vntil they haue conducted their Actions to a good and happy end: Wee therefore, hauing propounded vnto Our &s;elues; as a principall worke of Our times, to or|deine and prouide, that the great commoditie of Broad-cloth, being one of the principall Dowries of Our Kingdome, may receiue the due Manufactures of Dying and Dre&s;&s;ing within the Realme; did to that end publi&s;h Our Royall Proclamation, dated the three and twentieth day of <HI>Iuly</HI> la&s;t, prohibiting and ordeyning, That no Broad-cloth, of what &s;ort &s;oeuer, made here within this Our Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be Exported Vndied and Vndre&s;t, after the &s;econd day of <HI>Nouember</HI> next en&s;uing the date of Our &s;aid Proclamation: Which time was giuen, a&s;well for the Merchant Aduenturers, to vent their Whites, which might be vpon their hands, as for the preparing of di|uers things, nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;etling of the new Trade of Died and dre&s;&s;ed Clothes. And We did further by Our &s;aid Proclamation promi&s;e <HI>in the Word of a King</HI> to all Our louing Subiects, that &s;hould vndertake to Export the &s;aid Broad-clothes in their true Manufactures, that neither the Charter of the Merchant Aduenturers, nor any other Licences or Di&s;pen&s;ations by <HI>Non ob&s;tantes,</HI> contrary to Our Lawes, heretofore granted by Vs, or any Our Predece&s;&s;ors, &s;hould be any maner of preiudice, impeachment, di&s;turbance, or interruption to &s;uch, as &s;hould after the time afore&s;aid vent the &s;aid Clothes Died and Dre&s;&s;ed, according to Our &s;aid Royall Ordinance and con&s;titution; but &s;hould be from the &s;aid &s;econd day of <HI>Nouember,</HI> declared to be annihilated, &amp; made void to all in|tents and purpo&s;es. At which time of the publi&s;hing of Our &s;aid Proclamation, We did expect that the &s;aid Charter of the Merchant Aduenturers &s;hould, before the &s;aid &s;econd day of <HI>Nouember,</HI> haue bene in due forme of Law &s;urrendred: But after, finding the &s;aid Company of Merchant Aduentu|rers to make difficulty concerning the Surrender of their Patent; We haue bene enforced through
<PB REF="2" MS="y"> their wilfulne&s;&s;e and inconformitie, a&s;well to order a Legall cour&s;e to be taken for the ouerthrowe of their &s;aid Patent: as al&s;o to licen&s;e diuers of Our louing Subiects, that haue very worthily, and with great alacrity, vndertaken to &s;et vp and manage the &s;aid Trade of Dyed and Dre&s;&s;ed Clothes, to export al&s;o Whites in the meane while, vntill &s;uch time as the &s;aid Patent of the Mer|chant Aduenturers &s;hall be by iudgement euicted, and &s;ome re&s;pite of time afterwards, le&s;t there might haue en&s;ued &s;ome &s;tand of the vent of Cloth before the new Trade were &s;etled: But for as much as the cour&s;e of a iudiciall proceeding, though in a Ca&s;e neuer &s;o cleare &amp; plaine, mu&s;t haue due formes &amp; times ob&s;erued according to the rules of Law, &amp; for that time in this ca&s;e is exceeding pre|cious, and that it is not po&s;&s;ible for the new intended Company, to goe on with that confidence and incouragement, that in &s;o great a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e were fit, as long as the Charter of the Merchant-Aduen|turers is put in vre, and practi&s;e:</P>
<P>Therefore to remoue and di&s;charge all di&s;couragements and impediments: Wee doe by the&s;e pre&s;ents prohibite, forbid, con&s;titute and ordeine, That from henceforth the Charter of the &s;aid Mer|chant aduenturers, and all powers, Lycences, authorities, priuiledges, formes of gouernement contained in the &s;ame, or otherwi&s;e all v&s;ages, holding of Courts, meetings, a&s;&s;emblies, and all o|ther proceedings, by colour or vertue thereof, together with all the dependances, be not from hence|foorth put in any manner of practi&s;e or execution, either in the parts beyond the Seas, or here with|in Our Kingdome. And to that end, Wee doe not onely notifie and publi&s;h this Our Royall pro|hibition and ordinance, a&s;well to all Forreiners, as to all Our louing Subiects, to whom it may ap|pertaine: But doe furthermore &s;traitly and expre&s;ly charge and commaund, a&s;wel the Gouernour, Deputie, or Deputies, and A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the &s;aid Company of the Merchant Aduentu|rers, as the whole bodie of them, and al&s;o euery of them in particuler, and all their Factors, Ser|uants and Mini&s;ters, a&s;well beyond the Seas, as on this &s;ide, within Our Kingdome and Domi|nions; That from this time forwards, they doe in no wi&s;e pre&s;ume, directly or indirectly, to doe, performe, or execute any Trade, Traffique, or Marchandizing, into, or from any the Countryes, or places where the &s;aid Merchant Aduenturers, are, or haue beene priuiledged, or any point or thing what&s;oeuer, by vertue or colour of their &s;aid Charter, or by vertue of any former treatie or treaties, betwixt any Our noble Progenitors, or Predece&s;&s;ors, and any Prince or Potentate, Citie or politique Gouernment, or former v&s;ages, vpon paine of Our High indignation, impri&s;onment, and other pu|ni&s;hment, which by Our Lawes or Prerogatiue Royall, may bee inflicted vpon them: Letting them know, that We &s;hall proceede again&s;t euery &s;uch offender, as a contemner of Our Royall Commandement, and a di&s;turber of &s;o excellent a worke, wherein We haue &s;o farre declared Our &s;elues for the Vniuer&s;all Weale, and comfort of Our people.</P>
<P>Prouided neuerthele&s;&s;e, that where Our Trea&s;urer of England hath directed his Letters to the Officers of Our Cu&s;tome-hou&s;e, and Ports, giuing libertie of importation, onely vntill the la&s;t of this pre&s;ent Moneth of <HI>December:</HI> That the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;hall not any way countermaund the &s;aid limitation of time &s;o prefixed, &amp; no longer: But that the &s;aid Merchant-Aduenturers, may during that time importe accordingly; any thing before in the&s;e pre&s;ents, to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</P>
