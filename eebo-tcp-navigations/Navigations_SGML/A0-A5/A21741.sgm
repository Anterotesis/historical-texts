<P>_FOra&s;muche as it is notorious, in what &s;ort, &s;ithence the publicke arre&s;t fir&s;t made of the Queenes Maie&s;ties &s;ubiectes, and of their &s;hippes and goodes in the lowe countreys of the kyng of Spayne, in the later ende of Decem|ber, in the yeere of our Lorde God. <HI>1568.</HI> her Maie&s;tie hath ben plea&s;ed to geue &s;undry orders for the pre&s;eruation of the goodes of the &s;ubiectes of the &s;ayde kyng, beyng afterwarde arre&s;ted in this Realme, for the indempnitie of her Maie&s;ties &s;ubiectes, without yeeldyng to make any &s;ale of them, &s;a|uyng &s;ome &s;mal portions, which otherwy&s;e would haue peri&s;hed, although &s;ale was before made generally in the lowe countreys of the goodes of her Maie&s;ties &s;ubiectes there arre&s;ted: and howe al&s;o afterwarde her Maie&s;tie was wel plea&s;ed, that certayne of her marchantes &s;hould repayre into the lowe countreys, to treate with the Duke of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">lua, Lieuetenant to the &s;ayde kyng, who had already &s;olde theyr goodes, for &s;ome treatie of a mutual re&s;titution of al manner of thynges arre&s;ted or &s;tayed in any of the kyngdomes and countreys of both the &s;ayde princes, whereby not only the &s;ubiectes of both partes, beyng owners, myght be relieued by recouerie of their owne, but thereby th occa&s;ion of vnkindne&s;&s;e, that myght for lacke of re&s;titution en&s;ue betwixt both the princes, myght al&s;o be auoyded. Whereupon dyd al&s;o folowe, that certayne per&s;ons in the name of both the princes, haue treated for the manner of re&s;titution, wherein many delayes haue ben v&s;ed by the mini&s;ters of the part of the &s;ayde kyng. And yet when by the frequent &s;oli&s;itation of her Maie&s;ties mini&s;ters v&s;ed, it was thought that al the great difficulties of the treatie had ben fully pa&s;t, and that the articles and couenantes were ordered to be faire written, or, as the common &s;peache is, put into <HI>mundum,</HI> &s;o as it was on the Queenes Maie&s;ties part dayly looked, that the &s;ame &s;houlde haue ben &s;ub&s;cribed and &s;ealed by the mini&s;ters on both &s;ides, and &s;o or|der for re&s;titution to haue folowed without delay: her Maie&s;tie notwith&s;tandyng this her preceadyng, fin|deth that contrarye to her expectation, the mini&s;ters that treated on the part of the kyng of Spayne, not only lacked &s;ufficient aucthoritie to conclude, as rea&s;on was they &s;houlde, and as they had from the begyn|nyng thereof ben oftentymes remembred, to procure &s;ufficient commi&s;&s;ion: but al&s;o they dyd, when the con|clution was looked for, newly offer before her Maie&s;ties coun&s;el, to adde &s;uch other &s;trange clau&s;es and con|ditions, as coulde not be accepted in any rea&s;on, without the manife&s;t preiudice of her Maie&s;ties honnour, and principally, without a playne and open gate or way to defeate the very certaintie of re&s;titution to her Maie&s;ties &s;ubiectes, with a &s;pecial proui&s;ion notwith&s;tandyng for a certaintie for the &s;ubiectes of the kyng of Spayne. Whereof, though the &s;ayd mini&s;ters were playnely and at good length enfourmed by her Ma|ie&s;ties coun&s;el, &amp; mo&s;t earne&s;tly required to refourme the &s;ame, and to make al the couenantes equall &amp; reci|proke for both partes: yet they woulde not be induced thereto, pretendyng that without further aucthoritie from the Duke of Alua, they coulde not alter tho&s;e theyr newe clau&s;es. Wherfore, her Maie&s;tie con&s;yderyng the long delayes herein v&s;ed, the decayes of the goodes here arre&s;ted, the lamentable complaintes of her mar|chantes for lacke of reliefe, with this al&s;o, that in the lowe countreys the goodes of her Maie&s;ties &s;ubiectes were already &s;olde, by order of the Duke of Alua long tyme &s;ythence, and that in Spayne al&s;o &s;uch as were of any value, were &s;olde by order of the kinges mini&s;ters there, and the re&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, wa&s;ted for lacke of keeping: hath by adui&s;e of her &s;ayd coun&s;el, as it were thereto vrged by very nece&s;&s;itie, determined to cau&s;e a publicke &s;ale to be made of the goodes of the &s;ayde kynges &s;ubiectes arre&s;ted in any of her Maie&s;ties domi|nions. In whiche &s;ale, her Maie&s;ties determination and plea&s;ure is, that al dexteritie and &s;inceritie &s;halbe v&s;ed: and for that purpo&s;e, her Maie&s;tie hath by adui&s;e of her coun&s;el, cau&s;ed a competent number of expert, &s;kilful, &amp; hone&s;t marchantes, a&s;wel Engli&s;he men, as &s;traungers of &s;undry nations, to be appoynted, where|of al&s;o &s;uche of the &s;ubiectes of the &s;ayde kyng of Spayne, as conueniently coulde be founde, haue ben na|med, called, and offered to be parties yf they wyl, who vpon their othes &s;hal make open &s;ale of al the &s;hippes, goodes, wares, and marchandizes arre&s;ted, to the mo&s;t aduantage and aduauncement in price they can or may, without &s;hewyng any affection therein directly or indirectly, to them &s;elues, or to any other per&s;on what&s;oeuer. And for the better execution thereof, her Maie&s;tie is plea&s;ed, and doth licence euery proprie|tarie or owner of any the &s;ayde &s;hippes or goodes &s;o arre&s;ted or deteyned here, as is afore&s;ayde, or the factour, or lawful atturney of any &s;uche owner, &s;afely and freely to come into this Realme, at any tyme within thir|tie dayes after the publication hereof, pre&s;enting them &s;elues with al conuenient &s;peede after their arriual, to &s;uche as &s;halbe appoynted to &s;ell the &s;ayde marchandizes, and not doyng or attempting any thyng to the
<PB REF="2" MS="y"> derogation or hurt of her Maie&s;tie, her &s;ubiectes, or Realme, but to depart after the &s;aid &s;ales made to them without they &s;halbe otherwy&s;e licen&s;ed: and that they may al&s;o lawfully buye al &s;uche goodes, wares, an marchandizes, as by theyr markes, or otherwy&s;e may be proued to belong to them, geuing as muche as any other rea&s;onably wyll for the &s;ame, and that all and euery per&s;on and per&s;ons buying any of the &s;ayde &s;hyppes, goodes, wares, or marchandizes, may carry and tran&s;port the &s;ame into any place or countrey beyonde the &s;eas, where it &s;hal &s;eeme good to them, yf the &s;ame can not as profitably be &s;olde here, pay|ing al dueties and cu&s;tomes due and payable for the &s;ame. And for the further declaration al&s;o of her Ma|ie&s;ties good di&s;po&s;ition and intent, her Maie&s;tie doth by the&s;e pre&s;entes notifie to al per&s;ons, that notwith|&s;tandyng the proceadyng of this &s;ale, none &s;halbe refu&s;ed that &s;hal come from the &s;ayde kyng fully auctho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ed by commi&s;&s;ion, but &s;halbe wyllyngly heard to treate further, and conclude any thyng that may tende to the benefite and good of both theyr kyngdomes and countreys, and to the weale of the marchantes and &s;ubiectes on both partes. And fora&s;muche as it is &s;u&s;pected, that diuers per&s;ons haue imbecelled and conueyed, and yet doo witholde diuers goodes, wares, and marchandizes belongyng to the &s;ubiectes of the &s;ayde kyng of Spayne: her Maie&s;tie doth &s;traightly charge and commaunde al manner of per&s;ons within her dominions, whiche haue &s;ythence the tyme of the fore&s;ayde arre&s;t had any &s;hippes, goodes, or money, belonging to the &s;ubiectes of the &s;ayd kyng of Spayne, in his or theyr cu&s;todie or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whereof there is no report yet made, accordyng to a proclamatio~ &s;et foorth the la&s;t of Iune. <HI>1570.</HI> &s;hal within fourtie dayes af|ter the publication hereof, bryng or &s;ende a tuft report thereof, to &s;uche per&s;ons as &s;halbe a&s;&s;igned or appoin|ted for the &s;ale of the wares and marchandizes, vpon payne that any makyng default of &s;uche reporte, &s;hal not only incurre her Maie&s;ties di&s;plea&s;ure, but &s;hal al&s;o after this admonition, be charged &amp; puni&s;hed as concealors and deteynors thereof with felonious mindes and intentes.</P>
