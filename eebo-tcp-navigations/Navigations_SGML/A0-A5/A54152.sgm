<HEAD>Information and Direction to &s;uch Per&s;ons as are inclined to <HI>America,</HI> &amp;c:</HEAD>
<P>THat the value and improvement of <HI>E&s;tates</HI> in our Parts of <HI>America,</HI> may yet appear with further cleane&s;s A&s;&s;urance of Enquirers, I propo&s;e to &s;peak my own Knowledg, and the ob&s;ervation of others, as particularly as I can; which I &s;hall compri&s;e under the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The advance that is upon Money and Goods.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Advance that is upon Labour, be it of Handicrafts or others.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The Advance that is upon Land.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>The Charge of Tran&s;porting a Family, and fitting a Plantation.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>The Way the Poorer &s;ort may be Tran&s;ported, and Seated, with Advantage to the Rich that help them.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>The ea&s;ier and better provi&s;ion that is to be made there for po&s;terity, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e that are not of great Sub&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>What &V;ten&s;els and Goods are fitting to carry for &V;&s;e or Profit.</HI></P>
<P>For the fir&s;t, Such <HI>Money</HI> as may be carried, as pieces of eight, advances <HI>Thirty,</HI> and <HI>Goods</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>Fifty per cent.</HI> Say I have 100 <HI>l. &s;terl.</HI> If I am but &s;ix in Family, I will pay my Pa&s;&s;age with the advance upon my money, and find my hundred pounds good in the Country at la&s;t. Upon <HI>Goods,</HI> well bought and &s;orted, there is more pro|fit: but &s;ome money is very requi&s;it for Trade &s;ake; for we find it gives Goods a better Market; &s;o that con&s;idering the great quantity of Goods already carried, it were not ami&s;s at pre&s;ent, if one half were in <HI>Money,</HI> and the other in <HI>Goods.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in General. But it particularly encourages Merchants, becau&s;e the profit by <HI>advance,</HI> is &s;eldom le&s;s then 50 <HI>l. &s;terl. per cent,</HI> which is very con&s;iderable; and we have already got &s;ome things for returns, as <HI>Skins, Furs, Whale-Oyle, Tobacco,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">II. For <HI>Labour,</HI> be it of <HI>Handicrafts,</HI> or <HI>Others,</HI> there is a con&s;iderable Encourage|ment by advance of price, to what is here, becau&s;e the Goods manufactured there ad|vance equal to tho&s;e the Merchant &s;ells, and where Provi&s;ion is at lea&s;t as cheap, and there is &s;uch additional gain, to the fir&s;t gain of Handicrafts here (of whom the Mer|chant buys) the <HI>American Handicraft mu&s;t have an extraordinary time of it.</HI> The like may be &s;aid of <HI>&V;nder Labourers</HI> for &s;ome time, untill the Country be better repleni|&s;hed with people.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Advance</HI> upon <HI>Land</HI> is Encouraging, which will be be&s;t apprehended by an Engli&s;h under&s;tanding, in a compari&s;on with the Lands of <HI>England,</HI> that he is fa|miliarly acquainted with.</P>
<P>If 500 Acres of <HI>unclear'd</HI> Land there, indifferently cho&s;en, will keep as many <HI>Milch Cowes,</HI> or <HI>fat as many Bullocks</HI> for the Market in Summer, as 50 Acres of impro|ved Land in <HI>England,</HI> as cho&s;en afore&s;aid, can do; then by computing the value of the Summers Gra&s;s of &s;uch fifty Acres of Land here, we &s;hall the better find the va|lue of 500 Acres of Land in <HI>America</HI>; for within that compa&s;s, the &s;ame quantity of Cattle may be well kept. Admit this then, that the Summers Gra&s;s of 50 Acres of middling Land in <HI>England,</HI> is worth 15 <HI>l.,</HI> I conceive that makes 20 <HI>l.,</HI> which is the price of the Inheritance of the 500 Acres, no dear Purcha&s;s. The co&s;t to go thither
<PB N="3" REF="2">
is no Objection, becau&s;e it is paid by the <HI>Advance</HI> that is upon the Money and Goods at the rate afore&s;aid. If the hazard of the Seas be objected, we &s;ee that the <HI>five hun|dreth</HI> Ship u&s;ing tho&s;e parts, does not mi&s;carry, and the Risk is run for them&s;elves on|ly. However, except in Winter, pa&s;&s;ages are plea&s;ant, as well as &s;afe.</P>
<P>But this Compari&s;on draws an Objection upon us that mu&s;t be obviated. <HI>What be|comes of your &s;tock in the Winter</HI>? I &s;ay our <HI>Woods</HI> usually keep them for the Market till <HI>December,</HI> and unle&s;s it be a more then ordinary Winter (which is ob&s;erved to hap|pen but once in four or five Years) or that they are young Stock, or Cattel big with Young, they mo&s;tly &s;hift for them&s;elves. But if Fodder be wanted, we have a &s;upply by <HI>Hay,</HI> we mow in the <HI>Mar&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Woods,</HI> or the <HI>Straw</HI> of the Engli&s;h Grain we u&s;e, or the <HI>Tops</HI> and <HI>Stalks</HI> of Indian Corn, and &s;ometimes that it &s;elf; a Thing <HI>hearty, and ea&s;ily ras'd,</HI> and is good to fat as well as keep, and an&s;wers to <HI>Oats, Pea&s;e, Beanes</HI> and and <HI>Fetches</HI> here, tho we have of them al&s;o.</P>
<P>This Scheam of <HI>Grazing</HI> and keeping of Stock, may inform Inquirers what the Woods and unbroken Lands of tho&s;e Countrys in &s;ome &s;ort will do, in proportion to Lands here, allowing equally for Care and Fodder on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, the produce of Wild Land there in this re&s;pect, is within le&s;s than ten to one, of what our cleared Land is here, and the purcha&s;e here, is an hundred to one Dearer, which mu&s;t needs make <HI>American Lands</HI> no hard <HI>Bargain</HI> to the Purcha&s;ers.</P>
<P>Now for clearing our <HI>Wood-lands</HI> in order to corn; the difficulty is not &s;o great as is imagined; our <HI>Trees,</HI> being not &s;o thick, or not &s;o burden&s;ome, but that four hands, in four months time, may ea&s;ily clear five and twenty Acres for the Plow; which, at 15 d. Engli&s;h <HI>per</HI> Day, for each hand comes to <HI>twenty five &s;hillings per Acre.</HI> The encrea&s;e of which, is with le&s;s then half the &s;eed, at lea&s;t equal to the improv'd Land of <HI>England.</HI> Add to this, the <HI>ten pence</HI> which buys the fee of an Acre unclear'd and an Acre of Land, producing the like quantity with Engli&s;h Ground, &s;hall co&s;t 1 l. 5 s. 10 d. which at eight years purcha&s;e, ought to yield three &s;hillings two pence three farthings <HI>per Annum.</HI> Now, where it brings an increa&s;e equal to Land of ten &s;hillings <HI>per Annum</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and what it produces, yields not, at pre&s;ent, a le&s;s value, the advantage is almo&s;t four to one, which I conceive is no incon&s;iderable ad|vance.</P>
<P>Having given this general <HI>account</HI> of Lands in tho&s;e parts of <HI>America,</HI> which for <HI>Variety</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> and <HI>Number</HI> of <HI>Fountains,</HI> falls not &s;hort, in my Opinion, of any Country I have &s;een in <HI>Europe</HI>; I &s;hall in the next place, for their help and Direction that intend thither.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fir&s;t, <HI>Set down the Charge of Tran&s;porting an ordinary Family.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The Method and Charge of their &s;etling a Plantation when there,</HI> vvhich vvill &s;erve for all Ranks, proportion &s;till con&s;idered. I vvill &s;uppo&s;e my &s;elf vvorth but one hundred Pounds.</P>

<P N="5">V. The way the Poorer &s;ort may be tran&s;ported, with advantage to the Rich that help them, is thus;</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, there are &s;uch as are able to tran&s;port, them&s;elves and Families, but are unable to build or &s;tock them&s;elves when they are there; others that have not enough to tran&s;port them&s;elves and Families, and &s;uch will come under a diffe|rent Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e may be entertained in this manner, Say I have 5000 Acres I will &s;ettle <HI>Ten Families</HI> upon them, in way of Village, and build each an hou&s;e, an out-hou&s;e for Cattle, furni&s;h every Family with &s;tock; as four <HI>Cows,</HI> two <HI>Sows,</HI> a couple of <HI>Mares,</HI> and a yoke of <HI>Oxen,</HI> with a Town <HI>Por&s;e, Bull and Boar</HI>; I find them with Tools, and give each their fir&s;t Ground-&s;eed. They &s;hall continue Seven Years, or more, as we agree at <HI>half encrea&s;e,</HI> being bound to leave the Hou&s;es in repair, and a <HI>Garden</HI> and <HI>Orchard,</HI> I paying for the Trees, and at lea&s;t <HI>twenty Acres</HI> of Land within <HI>Fence,</HI> and <HI>improved</HI> to Corn and Gra&s;s: The charge will come to about <HI>&s;ixty</HI> pounds Engli&s;h for each Family: At the &s;even years end, the Improvement Will be worth, as things go now, 120 <HI>l.</HI> be&s;ides the value of the <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> of the Stock, which may be near as much more, allowing for ca&s;ualities; e&s;pecially, if the People are hone&s;t and careful, or a man be upon the &s;pot him&s;elf, or have an Over&s;eer &s;ometimes to in&s;pect them. The charge in the whole is 832 <HI>l.</HI> And the value of &s;tock and improvements 24<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">0 <HI>l.</HI> I think I have been mode&s;t in my computation. The&s;e <HI>Farms</HI> are aftewards fit for <HI>Lea&s;es</HI> at full Reat, or how el&s;e the Owner &s;hall plea&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of them. Al&s;o the People will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well provided to &s;et|tle them&s;elves with &s;tock upon their own Land, which &s;hall be a thou&s;and Acres their <HI>Land-lord</HI> will give them, which is own hundred to each Family, in &s;ome part of his five thou&s;and Acres, they only paying for the &s;ame ten &s;hillings yearly, which is a &s;hilling for each Family.</P>
<P>The advantage of this way; is chiefly to tho&s;e that go, for as the benefit &s;eems greater, &s;o is the hazard, by lo&s;s or embezlement of &s;tock, unle&s;s one were pre&s;ent, or a dilligent and hone&s;t Over&s;eer there: But tho&s;e that de&s;ign going, and have money, and aim to live with mo&s;t Ea&s;e, cannot do better; for the half encrea&s;e of the &s;tock and labour of tho&s;e Families will &s;upply them with Provi&s;ions; &s;o that they need not toyl, in a way, they are perhaps unacquainted with, for their accommodations of life. And if half encrea&s;e be thought a way too uncertain, it may be brought to a certain value, by paying a yearly Rent for &s;uck &s;tock as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of <HI>poor people</HI> my be very beneficially tran&s;ported upon the&s;e terms:
<PB N="7" REF="4">
Say I have 5000 <HI>Acres</HI> I &s;hould &s;ettle as before, I will give to each Family 100 <HI>Acres,</HI> which in the whole makes 1000; and to each Family <HI>thirty pounds</HI> Engli&s;h, half in hand, and half there, which in the whole comes to 300 <HI>l.</HI> After four years are expir|ed, in which time they may be ea&s;ie, &amp; in a good condition, they &s;hall each of them pay five pounds, <HI>and &s;o yearly for ever, as a Fee-Farm rent</HI>; vvhich in the vvhole comes to 50 <HI>l.</HI> a Year. Thus a man that, buys 5000 <HI>Acres</HI> may &s;ecure and &s;ettle his 40000 by gift of one, and in a vvay, that hazard and intere&s;t allovved for, amounts to at lea&s;t ten <HI>per cent.</HI> upon Land &s;ecurity; be&s;i&s;tes the value it puts upon the re&s;t of the 5000 <HI>Acres,</HI> vvhich vvill be, for that rea&s;on, really vvorth three times as much as before. In the&s;e Families I propo&s;e that there be at lea&s;t <HI>two working hands</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>wife,</HI> vvhether &s;on or &s;ervant; and that they oblige vvhat they carry; and for further &s;ecurity bind them&s;elves as &s;ervants for &s;ome time, that they vvill &s;ettle the &s;aid Land accordingly, and vvhen they are once &s;eated, their improvements are <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> enough for the Rent.</P>
<P>There is yet another expedient, &amp; that is, give to <HI>ten Families</HI> 1000 <HI>Acres</HI> for ever, at a <HI>&s;mall acknowledgment,</HI> and &s;ettle them in vvay of Village, as before; by their &s;eat|ing thus, the Land taken up is &s;ecured from others, becau&s;e the <HI>method</HI> of the Coun|try is an&s;vvered, and the value &s;uch a &s;ettlement gives to the re&s;t re&s;erved, is not in|con&s;iderable; I mean, the 4000 <HI>Acres</HI>; e&s;pecially that vvhich is <HI>Contiguous</HI>: For their <HI>Children</HI> vvhen grovvn up, and Handicrafts vvill &s;oon covet to fix next them, and &s;uch after &s;ettlements beginning at an <HI>Improved Rent in Fee, or for long Lea&s;es, on &s;mall Acknowledgments, and good Improvements,</HI> mu&s;t advance the vvhole con&s;iderably. I conceive any of the&s;e methods to i&s;&s;ue in a &s;ufficient advantage to adventurers, and they all give good encouragement to feeble and poor Families. Novv I knovv &s;ome think this looks a little hard upon the People that are to pay the &s;aid Rent, the thing that is mo&s;t contrary to my inclinations, as vvell as de&s;ign in making this propo&s;al. But I am of another mind; for in <HI>Ireland,</HI> money bears the Intere&s;t of <HI>ten per cent</HI>: Thirty pounds then, will de&s;erve three pounds a Year, three Years Intere&s;t makes 9 <HI>l.</HI> The 100 Acres &s;urveyed ct Patented are worth 8 <HI>l.</HI> at lea&s;t, for that is one of the lowe&s;t pri&s;es Parcha&s;ers &s;ell again at. The Intere&s;t of this 8 <HI>l.</HI> for three Years at <HI>ten per cent,</HI> is <HI>Eight and forty &s;hillings</HI>; there is al&s;o three &s;hillings for three years rent. Novv put the thirty, the nine, the eight, and the tvvo pounds eight &s;hillings, and the three &s;hillings together, and there vvill be <HI>forty nine pounds eleven &s;hillings,</HI> vvhich vvants but nine &s;hillings of <HI>fifty pounds,</HI> and you advance no more then money does in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> that is neerer home, and an improv'd Country&punc; to vvhich add, the hazard that is Run, in this vvay, above a double Bond for the payment of the fifty pounds in <HI>Ire|land</HI>; for the &s;hip peri&s;h, my money is gone, if the man or vvorking hands Dye, I have a Charge in&s;tead of a Revenue that vvill follovv me; vvhich plainly evidences that the propo&s;ition is not grievous, but rea&s;onable and charitable too, and e&s;pecially vvhen vve Con&s;ider that Sixty five Days out of the Year, at eighteen pence by Day, vvill, vvithin half a Crovvn, pay the Rent, and as he has <HI>three Hundred</HI> to him&s;elf. Nor is this all, he is come to a Country vvhere Lands is cheap, and does Ri&s;e, and vvhere tho&s;e that have hands cannot but live, and in a vvay too, not &s;ubject to the Contingiences &amp; decays of Trades; for as belovv the ground none can fall, &s;o here eve|ry one falls upon his ovvn; vvhich brings me to the Sixth Particular, about the bene|fit the&s;e Countries bring to <HI>Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>There is an ea&s;ier and better provi&s;ion to be made there for po&s;terity, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are not of great &s;ub&s;tance.</HI> I never thought, but mere Trades vvould do as vvell here as there, but vvhen People have gain'd &s;omething here by their ingenuity and Toyl &s;ay
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">000 <HI>l.</HI> hovv much Land vvill that buy here, and hovv much income vvill that fetch; perhaps 50 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> on Bond, or 40 in Land, vvhich at ten &s;hillings by the <HI>Acre,</HI> comes to four&s;core <HI>Acres.</HI> This, to bring up five Children, <HI>Feed, Cloath, School,</HI> and <HI>Portion them,</HI> vvill be very &s;canty; but then, vvhat vvill this do to E&s;tate their Chil|dren, and &s;o forvvard.</P>
<P>Novv in <HI>America,</HI> a thou&s;and Pounds di&s;creetly laid out, is an Exchequer to a fami|ly. I vvill &s;uppo&s;e I have one hundred Pounds in Land, vvhich contains 3000 Acres. This I &s;tock, to half increa&s;e, for 360 <HI>l.</HI> upon this half increa&s;e I live vvell, till my Children are of age. By this time at lea&s;t, the Tennants Term is up, and I place my Children in tho&s;e Tenements, vvith a proportion of &s;tock, vvithout Portions or Rents to pay: Each has 500 Acres, be&s;ides my five hundred after my decea&s;e. If each of them have five Children, there is an hundred Acres a piece for them, be&s;ides the 500 Acres I leave them; and if any take to Trades, the re&s;t have the more Land. By this time, an hundred Acres may be rea&s;onably pre&s;um'd to be vvorth as much as a 1000 vvas in their Fathers time, and it mu&s;t advance yet: All improv'd Countries teach us this. Novv this is a vvay of putting people into the natural Channal of life to vvit, <HI>Agriculture,</HI> and of Adjourning care for po&s;terity to the Fourth Generation. Let it be remembred that there is but 360 <HI>l.</HI> expended of the 1000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;o that to carry me and my Family, and &s;ettle us in &s;ome proportion to our degree, as al&s;o to Traffick and encrea&s;e portions, there re&s;ts 640 <HI>l.</HI> Novv if a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> cannot have &s;o natural an increa&s;e, free of tho&s;e Contingences that other means of life are &s;ub|ject to, I conceive <HI>America</HI> &s;omevvhat a better place for the good of Po&s;terity, e&s;peci|ally of &s;uch as are not vvealthy, or have many Children, that they vvould nor &s;hould too unequally live and be provided for.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Novv as to vvhat Uten&s;els and Goods are fitte&s;t to carry for u&s;e and profit, I &s;ay, in general, all things relating to <HI>Apparrel, Building, Hou&s;hould&s;tuff, Hu&s;bandry, fowling</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hing:</HI> but for Particulars, <HI>Engli&s;h Woollen,</HI> and <HI>German Linnen,</HI> as ordi|nary <HI>broad-Clothes, Kere&s;eys, Searges, Norwich-Stuffs,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Duffels, Cottons</HI> &amp; <HI>Stroud-waters,</HI> for the Natives, and <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Blew</HI> Ozenburgs, <HI>Shoes,</HI> and <HI>Stockins, Buttons, Silk, Threed, Iron ware,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Felling Axes, Hows, Indian Hows, Saws, Frows, Drawing-Knives, Nailes,</HI> but of 6. <HI>d.</HI> and 8. <HI>d.</HI> a treble quantity, becau&s;e they u&s;e them for shingling, or covering of Hou&s;es. <HI>Powder</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI> are often vvanted for the <HI>Woods,</HI> in Winter, for Water Fovvl that are very numerous. There are le&s;&s;er things that vvill be convenient to carry; but being trivial in them&s;elves, and vvhat People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> hardly mi&s;s to think upon; I &s;hall clo&s;e this Information and direction vvith my u&s;ual Caution, and good Wi&s;hes. Let none be Ha&s;ty or Pre&s;umptuous. The even humble Temper vvill be&s;t endure the difference of the Change either vvay. A Wilderne&s;s mu&s;t vvant &s;ome things improv'd Countries do enjoy; but Time and La|bour vvill reprize, vvhere Indu&s;try &s;ooner makes an Inheritance. And tho vve have not the Ornaments of Life, vve vvant not the Conveniences; and if their Co&s;t vvere put in Ballance vvith their Benefit, the World vvould be greatly debtor on Account. If then vve have le&s;s of Art, vve have more of Nature; and the Works of God are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> objects for meditation and Delight; then the Inventions of men. In vain do vve admire the Fir&s;t and Simpler Ages of the World, and &s;tile them Golden, vvhile vve object again&s;t <HI>America's Ru&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Solitude.</HI></P>
<P>I vvill &s;ay no more, but if <HI>Jacob</HI> dvvelt in Tents, and Herds and Flocks vvere his Re|venue, a Life like his &s;hould be no &s;top vvith tho&s;e that love his Plainne&s;s and Inte|grity. I be&s;eech God it may be &s;o vvith them that go, and I am &s;ure they vvill not have much Rea&s;on to repent their Change.</P>
