<P>The Royall Merchant (or Merchant Royall) &s;ome foure yeares &s;ince &s;ailed out of this land as a &s;hip hired here for the King of Spains imployment in the We&s;t India, &s;he &s;ayled out in company with other &s;hips, but when come into Cales the Captain was by &s;ome oppo&s;ition like to be put by, and was a while di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;o that giving over his hopes of the We&s;t India imployment, received fraught, and from Cales &s;ayled into the Mediterranean unto the I&s;land of Majorcke, one of the King of Spaines I&s;lands: in the meane, or about the time, S.

Some dangers they pa&s;t, but &s;afely arived in Cales, where they continued afore they could prepare them&s;elves for England at lea&s;t 7. or 8. months, at end of which they di&s;imbogu'd for England in company of Captaine <HI>Legend</HI> of Dover, in the Do|ver Merchant, a lu&s;ty &s;tout &s;hip of 400. tunnes, and 28. ca&s;t peeces of Ordnance; they &s;ayled together, the Royall Merchant in &s;tre&s;&s;e of foule weather

They labour at their pumps with great &s;trength, but could not prevaile over what was got in, but did keepe her in that e|&s;tate, nor more nor le&s;&s;e dimini&s;hing.</P>
<P>They being ouerlaboured could hardly pumpe more to any purpo&s;e; &s;ome of the Sea-men to the number of 30. got into the long boat, cut her off, and called to the Captaine to &s;ave him&s;elfe, he re|fu&s;ed it, and would have a Merchant, his pa&s;&s;enger, to &s;ave him&s;elfe, he an&s;wered hee had lived long in Spaine, and with great trouble got up 10000. pound, and now would &s;tay by it, for his life hee valued not, the Captaine an&s;wered him it was all one whether he went in the boate or no, for they were in no better e&s;tate then tho&s;e left aboord, having in the boat no oares, ma&s;ts, &s;ailes, or any thing to keepe the boate afar the Sea, and mu&s;t needs peri&s;h undoubtedly: being thus in de&s;paire they e&s;pied a light at which they &s;hot off 30. piece of ordnance, it prooved to bee Captaine <HI>Legend</HI>

This &s;hip was 700. tuns, 36. ca&s;t peeces of ordnance, 80. &s;eamen, be&s;ides pa&s;&s;engers, &s;he had in her 300000. pound in ready boloigne, 100000. pound in gold, and as much value in Iewels, be&s;ides each mans adven|ture, and the whole Carga&s;on, or rich lading of the &s;hip, all which was &s;unke in the &s;ea, nothing &s;aved.
