<L>AFter one Summers being in Arms in vain,</L>

<L>When to drink <HI>U&s;quebagh,</HI> and pick his Toes,</L>
<L>Mend his pacht <HI>Brogues,</HI> and Mundifie his Cloaths,</L>
<L>Was all Teague had to do, one would have thought,</L>
<L>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> might to Di&s;cipline been brought;</L>
<L>For tho' their Wit and Sen&s;e can never Charm ye,</L>
<L>They might have learnt the Language of an Army:</L>
<L>When their great Generals, fam'd beyond the Moon,</L>
<L>Were Deputy King <HI>James,</HI> and Count <HI>Lazune.</HI></L>
<L>The fir&s;t, (for why &s;hould we great Actions bury,)</L>
<L>So famous for his Flight from <HI>Salisbury.</HI></L>
<L>The other who from's Ma&s;ter learnt the Trick</L>
<L>Of Burning Towns, becau&s;e they're Heretick:</L>
<L>But they learnt only how to fight in je&s;t,</L>
<L>Nay, when they were by greate&s;t dangers pre&s;t,</L>
<L>And minding nothing that their Generals &s;ay,</L>
<L>But how to face about and run away,</L>
<L>Not Bullies Scouring from the Mid-Night Watch,</L>
<L>Nor needy Debtor from a Serjeants Catch,</L>
<L>Could Fa&s;ter run, than did the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Hoa&s;t.</L>
<L>When Great King <HI>William</HI> o're the <HI>Boyn</HI> was cro&s;t;</L>
<L>Their Abdicated Prince fir&s;t &s;how'd the way,</L>
<L>And why &s;hould they behind their Leader &s;tay?</L>
<L>For he, 'tis &s;aid, from Hubbaboos and Hoots,</L>
<L>Rode &s;ixty Mile that day, and &s;poil'd his Boots.</L>
<L>'Twould be a Jubile at <HI>Rome that Day,</HI></L>
<L>If <HI>James</HI> could learn to fight, as well as Pray.</L>
<L>And I'le affirm't without his Royal Word,</L>
<L>'Tis a good Cau&s;e &s;ets th'edge upon a Sword.</L>
<L>But his is &s;uch a &s;neaking little Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>And much more &V;gly, then he made our Laws;</L>
<L>A Cau&s;e of &s;uch a Tottering &s;inking Fame,</L>
<L>No Prince e're thriv'd, that undertook the &s;ame;</L>
<L>And were there but a wor&s;er Place than Hell,</L>
<L>May they be all &s;ent there, that wi&s;h it Well.</L>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I had once a very great Pa&s;&s;ion for a young Gentlewoman that was Marry'd, and &s;he had as great an Affection for me; but not finding an Opportunity to couzen her Jealous Husband, I ordered her to counterfeit her &s;elf Sick, and to &s;end for me to cure her with a Relick of a Saint that I had. Ac|cordingly &s;he did &s;o, and fending for me, accordingly I went, and took one of my Brethren of the &s;ame Covent along with me, and while he was bu&s;ie with the Maid, I employ'd my time with the Sick Mi&s;tre&s;s. But the Mi&s;chief was, that being like to have been &s;urpriz'd by the Husband, for ha&s;t I left my Breeches be|hind; and had it not been for a Fetch that the Devil put into her
<PB N="30" REF="18">Head (I &s;hall love him the better for't as long as I live) we had both been di&s;cover'd.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, that was debated in Council at the be|ginning&mdash;But then it was found, that all the <HI>Butchers, Brew|ers, Bakers, Clothiers, Weavers, Taylors, Shoo-makers, Hat-makers, Smiths, Carpenters,</HI> and other <HI>Artizans</HI> were Hereticks, &s;o that had they bin remov'd, your Souldiers could have had neither Meat, Bread, nor Drink, nor Cloaths to wear, nor Carts to carry their Provi&s;ion and Ammunition into the Field; nor would your Maje&s;ty have had a Mint and Workmen to Coyn your Bra&s;s and Copper.&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Nugent.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, Sir, there is Order taken to &s;ecure the Hereticks &s;afe enough&mdash;Your own Example in <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s time, has taught us to confine 'em all with in the Churches, Ho&s;pi|tals and Jayls of the City, 'till the Bu&s;ine&s;s be well over; and then you may make Bonfires of 'em for your Victories.&mdash;</P>
