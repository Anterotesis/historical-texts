<HEAD>Pre&s;ent, The KING'S Mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty in Council.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P><HI>The Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of Trade did this Day pre&s;ent unto his Maje&s;ty in Council, a Report touching the Injuries which his Subjects did &s;u&s;tain by the</HI> French Capers, <HI>in the Words following.</HI></P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere was pre&s;ented unto your Maje&s;ty in Council, on the 31&s;t. of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, a Peti|tion in the Name of all the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> and other Places, concerned in the &s;eve|ral Ships Taken by the <HI>French Privateers,</HI> and carried into &s;everal Ports of that Kingdom; And their Complaints con&s;i&s;ted of the Points follow|ing.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Ship and Goods of your Subjects though Manned according to the Act of Navi|gation, and furni&s;hed with all nece&s;&s;ary Pa&s;&s;es,
<PB N="4" REF="6">were daily &s;eized carried into <HI>Dunkirk, Calais, Sherbrook,</HI> and other Ports, the Ma&s;ters and Mar|riners kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, to force them by hard|&s;hip to abu&s;e their Owners, or el&s;e for Reliefe of their own nece&s;&s;ityes (being commonly &s;triped and plundered) to enter into the Privateers &s;ervice, which great numbers have done, with very pernitious effects.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the delay and charg of Pro&s;ecuting the Law in <HI>France,</HI> does commonly make the Own|ers to become Loo&s;ers of halfe the Value, when ever they are mo&s;t Succe&s;sful.</P>
<P N="3">3. That there is no Reparation ever gotten from Privateers, for what they plunder and im|bezzle, which makes them freely &s;eize upon all they meet, and perpetually mole&s;t the Navigation of your Subjects.</P>
<P>Wherefore, your Petitioners humbly implor|ing your Maje&s;ties Protection and releife, Your Maje&s;ty was hereupon graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, out of a Sen&s;e of your Subjects &s;ufferings, to command that &s;ome Frigats &s;hould &s;aile forth to cleare the Coa&s;t of tho&s;e Privateers, to &s;eize them, and bring &s;uch as had offended to make Re&s;titution. And your Maje&s;ty did further Or|der, That the Committee of Trade, &s;hould as well take notice of the particular Ca&s;es and Com|plaints depending, that &s;uch of them as were of
<PB REF="6">Weight and Merit, might be fitted to receive your mo&s;t gracious Recommendation for Re|liefe, as to Survey, the whole number of Seiz|zures, which have been made on your Subjects, in Order to lay before your Maje&s;ty what hard|&s;hip have been &s;u&s;teyned at Sea, and what &s;ort of Ju&s;tice hath been admini&s;tred in <HI>France,</HI> with their opinions of what is fit to advi&s;e your Ma|je&s;ty therein.</P>
<P>In Obedience to which Command, we have hereunto annexed a Li&s;t of &s;uch Ships as have been &s;eized, to the Number of 53. And the Ca&s;es wherein the Owners have repaired unto your Ma|je&s;ty, either in your Council, or by your Secre|tary of State for Relief. Which, as in the general it &s;uppo&s;es a Ju&s;tice in &s;uch Complaints, &s;o, it leaves a &s;u&s;picion of great hard&s;hip in the Me|thods of Redre&s;s. And the number of Captures is no &s;mall proof of the facility of Condem|nation.</P>
<P>How many other helple&s;s men there have been (be&s;ides the &s;aid Ca&s;es) who have not had ability to pro&s;ecute, or how many of the&s;e Ca&s;es have been favoured with Redre&s;&s;e, we cannot cer|tainly under&s;tand, till the Information we have &s;ought for, come from <HI>Paris,</HI> which may al&s;o en|able us to compleat their circum&s;tances of every Ca&s;e.</P>
<PB REF="7">
<P>But in the mean time, &s;uch of all the In&s;tan|ces of Redre&s;&s;e, as are come to our knowledge, we have not failed, in the <HI>Margine,</HI> to make men|tion of them, being in number Seven.</P>
<P>While we were in the mid'&s;t of this Pro&s;ecu|tion, Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> does on the &s;ixth in&s;tant, pre&s;ent unto the Committee a Paper, which he received from the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Courtin,</HI> relating to the&s;e matters, and the Contents thereof were as follow.</P>

<P>An Extract of a Letter from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert</HI> to Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' Pompone,</HI> written the 28th. of <HI>June,</HI> 1676.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P><HI>FOR what concerns the Prizes it would be a difficult matter to An&s;wer to all the Ca&s;es con|tained in Mon&s;ieur</HI> Courtin's <HI>Letter; What I can &s;ay, is,</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Council for</HI> Marine Affairs, <HI>Sits every</HI> Friday <HI>at St.</HI> Germans.</P>
<P><HI>That all</HI> Privateers <HI>and</HI> Reclaimers <HI>know it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That Sir</HI> Ellis Leighton, <HI>nominated by the</HI> Eng|li&s;h <HI>Emba&s;&s;ador hath alwayes notice of it, and is all|wayes pre&s;ent at it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That not a Week pa&s;&s;es, but I give him two or three Audiences, and oftentimes I &s;end for him on purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<PB REF="7">
<P><HI>His Rea&s;ons are all Reported, Read and Exami|ned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As likewi&s;e are all Petitions of</HI> Reclaimers, <HI>and I &s;hall tell you more, I acquaint him with the Rea&s;ons upon which Judgement is given.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In giving Judgement all Ve&s;&s;ells which have any Ap|pearance of being</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>are Relea&s;t, and very often, and almo&s;t alwayes, although we are &s;ati&s;fyed that the Ships are</HI> Dutch, <HI>yet they are relea&s;ed becau&s;e there is &s;ome appearance of their being</HI> Engli&s;h; <HI>And every thing is Judged favourably for that Nation; And it is true that all Ships that are taken are of</HI> Dutch <HI>built; That they never were in</HI> England; <HI>that the Ma&s;ters and all the equipage are</HI> Dutch; <HI>That the Documents are for per&s;ons unknown, and which are not oftentimes &s;o wuch as named; That they carry with them onely &s;ome Sea briefes from</HI> Waterford <HI>or &s;ome other Towne of</HI> Ireland <HI>or</HI> Stotland; <HI>That the whole Ships Com|pany Depo&s;es, they were &s;ent to</HI> Holland; <HI>That we have found on Board three or four Ve&s;&s;ells, Bills of Accompts, by which is &s;een the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>take two three and four,</HI> Per Cent. <HI>For Owning of Ships; And although it is impo&s;sible to avoid confi&s;cateing them, yet the&s;e are the Ships which make &s;uch a noi&s;e in</HI> Eng|land.</P>
</FLOATEXT>
<P>In An&s;wer to which <HI>Remarques;</HI> though it be true that all re&s;pect imaginable ought to be given to what Mini&s;ters of that Con&s;ideration do pro|nounce,
<PB REF="8">Yet there being &s;ome difference be|tween them who feel the &s;mart, and tho&s;e who feel it not; we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome particulars, that your Maje&s;ty may di&s;cerne whether your Subjects are &s;o fortunate in their freedome of Trade at Sea, or in the helps of Ju&s;tice when they are &s;eized, as the Report and Information of the Letter would &s;eem to make out. For as it magni|fyes the favour which is exerci&s;ed in <HI>France,</HI> the facility in all Addre&s;&s;es, and the tenderne&s;&s;e to releive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men in all Complaints, &s;o we cannot on this Subject but owne to your Maje&s;ty the very different Re&s;entments we have thereof, for we under&s;tand that when <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships are brought into the <HI>Ports</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> many of the Marriners complaining of ill Treatment, and &s;ome of Torment, their Papers being &s;eized and their Per&s;ons in re&s;traint, till all Examinations are prepared, Then are all the Writings &s;ent up to the Privy Council at St. <HI>Germans,</HI> and there Judgment definitively given; Seldome are any of the rea&s;ons of Condemnation mentioned in the Decree, and never any Appeal or Revi&s;ion admitted of (So at lea&s;t it was until the 20th of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t) And whether this be the tenderne&s;&s;e or the Ju&s;tice which is mentioned we do not know; But we are well a&s;&s;ured, that the Methods of your Maje&s;ty Clemency, and Ju&s;tice on like oc|ca&s;ions,
<PB N="9" REF="8">have been far otherwi&s;e. And we ap|peal to the pre&s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cour|tin,</HI> if almo&s;t in all Ca&s;es, that he or any other of the Emba&s;&s;adors thought fit to own (when his Excellency was here before, and your Maje&s;ty in War with <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;eizing many Ships as Prize, and under great &s;u&s;picion claimed by the <HI>French</HI>) whether it were not very cu&s;tomary, to have a &s;hort Reference, and a &s;ummary Examination of all Papers by the Judge of the Admiralty in his Chamber, and that if any thing appeared fair in the Ca&s;e, whether the Ships were not immedi|ately Relea&s;ed without Law, charge or delay? And 'twil not be out of &s;ea&s;on, we hope, to annex hereunto the Copy of an Order of the 22th. of <HI>July</HI> 1665, Signed by the then Lords Commi&s;&s;i|oners of Prizes, where it will appear, That <HI>Eigh|teen French Ships</HI> (which were Laden with Wine and Brandy) being at <HI>Dover,</HI> and detained as Prize, were all <HI>Eighteen</HI> by one Order di&s;charg|ed, without any Law, or even the Ceremony of the Judges Examination, being &s;ingly on the Credit of the Emba&s;&s;adors Word, affirming that they belonged unto the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the matter of <HI>Revi&s;ions</HI> or <HI>Appeals,</HI> after Sentence in the Court of Admiralty here; We know his Excellency will al&s;o remember, that never any man was denied his liberty there|in,
<PB N="10" REF="9">but on the contrary, your Maje&s;ty gave a &s;tanding Commi&s;&s;ion for Appeals in all Ca&s;es of Prizes, and filled it with the Lords of your Council only, that every Ca&s;e might receive a candid a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> well as unque&s;tionable determina|tion.</P>
<P>We might al&s;o put your Maje&s;ty in mind that during the whole terme of your late League with <HI>France,</HI> when ever any <HI>French</HI> Ships were &s;eized by the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and afterwards retaken by his Maje&s;ties Frigats, &s;uch <HI>French</HI> Ships were allwayes re&s;tored on demand, no con&s;ideration being had of the time they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> Whether a Month, two, or three as &s;ome times they were, and when the <HI>French</HI> owner as it hath happened knew not of &s;uch re|taking, but that the Ship was according to Law, condemned to your Maje&s;ty and &s;ould with o|ther Prizes, yet the Claimer appearing, your Maje&s;ty hath ordered the Mony and product of the Ships to be re&s;tored unto him.</P>
<P>Such Various Methods of Ju&s;tice and of Clemency, might have entituled your Maje&s;ty to a different acknowledgment, and more advan|tageous effects.</P>
<P>As to the other part of the &s;aid Paper, It &s;eems to containe very har&s;h imputations on the Trade of your Maje&s;ties Subjects, and from &s;ome ill
<PB N="11" REF="9">practice perhaps found out (as every where there may be In&s;tances of the like) General Rules are made, and &s;evere Impre&s;&s;ions taken, which have|ing entred the thoughs of &s;ome eminent Mini&s;ters we mu&s;t not wonder (how frequent and how multiplyed &s;oever your Maje&s;ties Recommenda|tions for Ju&s;tice are) that the Events of Tryalls prove &s;o unfortunate, If your Muje&s;ty will but Vouch&s;afe to ca&s;t your Eye on the Ca&s;es here annext, You will &s;oon &s;ee.</P>
<P>Whether (as is imputed) all the Ships taken are <HI>Dutch</HI> built?</P>
<P>Whether they are all &s;uch as never were in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>Whether all the Ma&s;ters and all the Marriners are <HI>Dutch?</HI></P>
<P>VVhether the Documents be for per&s;ons un|known and oftentimes not named.</P>
<P>VVhether in the whole Li&s;t there be more then one Ship from <HI>Waterford</HI> and but &s;ix from the re&s;t of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> but from <HI>Scotland</HI> not &s;o much as one?</P>
<P>VVhether tis credible all the Ships Company do &s;wear they are &s;ent to <HI>Holland</HI> when &s;o many are taken even comming from <HI>Holland?</HI></P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty may &s;ee how many Ships in the Li&s;t are <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> built taken with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, <HI>Engli&s;h Marriners, Engli&s;h</HI> Owners, &s;ome of them
<PB N="12" REF="10">known to your Maje&s;ty, and to whom the be&s;t Papers your Maje&s;ty or your Mini&s;ters can &s;igne or the Treaties do require, are given, but all in vain.</P>
<P>So that if the Ca&s;e be in the General quite dif|ferent from what in the General is repre&s;ented we hope it will be no crime for your Maje&s;ties Subjects to make &s;ome Noi&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> when they are hurt and when they &s;ee their goods taken from them by Violence, and that Violence rather Ju&s;tifyed then redre&s;t by Law.</P>
<P>Tis not for the Condemnation pa&s;t on tho&s;e very ill ca&s;es ennumerated that your Subjects do complain, for it were to their Advantage if all &s;uch were Puni&s;hed and deterred from Trade, who by collu&s;ion take &s;hare in that Profit which the favour of the pre&s;ent conjuncture &s;eems wholly to appropriate to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>And &s;urely your Maje&s;ty and the whole King|dome did reckon upon this advantage, and the Extent of Trade that would naturally &s;low in as one of the greate&s;t friuts and ble&s;&s;ings of your peace, &s;o that your Maje&s;ty being &s;en&s;ible of great decay and lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> trading Ships in the late War, did think it advi&s;able to admit your Subjects to repaire them&s;elves on the &s;udden by purcha&s;ing of forraigne Ships, and your Maje&s;ty by your Authority made them free, and fit to
<PB N="13" REF="10">partake in the benefit of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, to the diminution of tho&s;e higher Cu&s;tomes, which otherwi&s;e &s;uch Ships were obliged to pay. And while your Subjects with the&s;e and with their own home built Ships are in pro&s;ecution of the &s;aid Advantages, while every man is invited by the Conjuncture to venture more and to inlarge his Trade, while by a general tru&s;t in the peace and allyance your Maje&s;ty holds with all your Neighbours round about, they are lead to go abroad unarmed and without defence, we cannot but lament it as a great misfortune and di&s;ap|pointment to ob&s;erve how the&s;e your Maje&s;ties Subjects are frequently made a Prey of and very evilly treated both at Sea and Land.</P>
<P>Wherefore con&s;idering that the Root of all this di&s;order ari&s;es from the violence and rapine of the <HI>French</HI> Capers, who ought to be looked on as di&s;turbers of the publick quiet, and Enemies to the good freind&s;hip between the two Crowns, We are humbly of opinion, That your Maje&s;ty has ju&s;t occa&s;ion from the Injuryes pa&s;t, and tho&s;e which are now depending and which do every day increa&s;e, to make a very &s;erious repre&s;enta|tion of all unto his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty; And not only pre&s;&s;e for &s;ome better method of repair|ing the grievances mentioned, But earne&s;tly to in&s;i&s;t on the calling in of all Privateers.
