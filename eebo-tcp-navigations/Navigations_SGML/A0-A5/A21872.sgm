Giuen vnder her Maiesties &s;ignet at <HI>Greenwich</HI> the xiiij. day of Aprill <HI>1591,</HI> and of her Maiesties reigne the xxxiij. yere.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Queenes Maie&s;tie con&s;idering the continuance of the vnnatural rebellion of a multitude of the French kings Subiectes in Fraunce, again&s;t their mo&s;t lawfull king, heretofore king of Nauarre, and now iu&s;tly entituled Henry the fourth king of Fraunce and Nauarre, being recommended to the realme by the la&s;t king before his death, in pre&s;ence of all the Princes of the bloud, and of the re&s;t of the Nobilitie of the Realme, to be his mo&s;t lawfull &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Crowne, and &s;o immediatly vpon the death of the &s;aide late French king, accep|ted and acknowledged by all the &s;aide Princes of the Bloud, inheritable to the crowne, without exception of any one of the &s;ame princes Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Tem|porall: And in like maner from the death of the la&s;t king, &s;erued and obeyed by all the auncient officers of the Crowne, and namely by all the Mar&s;hals of Fraunce, the principall officers of that Realme, and by the grea|te&s;t part of all the Noble men, gouernors of the Prouinces. And that it now manife&s;tly appeareth, that this vnnaturall rebellion is fauoured by none of the auncient byrth of Fraunce, but by a very fewe of a &s;trange bloud, lately brought in, and planted by marriages in Fraunce, being onely branches depending of the hou&s;e of Lorraine, which is no naturall member of the Crowne of Fraunce to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the &s;ame: Therefore her Ma|ie&s;tie hath for the&s;e and many other cau&s;es in the &s;ight of Almightie God very iu&s;t, and to the world mo&s;t hono|rable, bene moued to yeelde to the &s;aid king her good brother and confederate, her fauour, both in approbati|on of his right, and wi&s;hing to him pro&s;peritie again&s;t his rebels, as &s;he thinketh there is no Monarch, nor any Soueraigne Potentate in all Chri&s;tendome but doth the like, &s;auing onely one: who not contented with all the kingdomes and dominions which his mo&s;t noble father left him, by rea&s;on of his aboundant riches brought to him out of his Indies, attempteth to augment his e&s;tate by encroching to him&s;elfe the dominions of his neighbors. And for that purpo&s;e, her Maie&s;tie hath al&s;o according to &s;uch power as God hath giuen to her, and as &s;he may conueniently yeelde with regarde to her owne e&s;tate, giuen to the &s;aid mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king &s;ome &s;uccours, and &s;o mindeth to continue her fauours, as manife&s;tly hath, and dayly is &s;eene, both to all &s;tran|gers, and to her owne people, and by none mi&s;liked but by the rebels and the king aboue de&s;cribed, who at this day is manife&s;tly &s;eene, that if he were di&s;po&s;ed to liue in peace, and be contented with his owne dominions, and not &s;eeke the dominions of any others, Chri&s;tendome were to enioy an vniuer&s;all peace, without any noy&s;e of warre in any countrie or corner of Chri&s;tendome. And now her Maie&s;tie finding that this populer rebellion again&s;t the &s;aid king, is fedde and maintained in &s;undry Port Townes of Fraunce, and &s;pecially in Norman|die and Britaine, where the people liue by bringing to them forreine marchandize, and by vent of their owne, and by receiuing of &s;uccours of victuals &amp; munitions of warre from forraine countries, without which the re|bels in their Ports could neither continue their rebellion, nor yet relieue their fellowe rebels within the land: Hath thought it meete, that although her &s;ubiects ought in rea&s;on of them&s;elues to haue con&s;idered as much, to will and charge, and &s;o &s;he doth expre&s;&s;ely will, charge, and commaunde, all maner her owne naturall Subiects, and all other per&s;ons re&s;orting to her realme, to forbeare from repayring to any Porte or Creeke of Picardie, Normandie, or Britaine, where the Rulers of the &s;ame Portes or Creekes doe not manife&s;tly obey the French king, and that in no manner, directly or indirectly, they doe cary or &s;end any Marchandize, victual, or munition to any Port or Towne, that doeth di&s;obey the French king, or doe v&s;e any trade of buying or &s;el|ling by bartering or by exchange with any of the kings rebels, or with their adherents either in Fraunce, or fraudulently here in England or el&s;ewhere: vpon paine that who&s;oeuer &s;hall attempt the contrarie, the &s;ame &s;hall be puni&s;hed as Traitors, and relieuers and &s;uccourers of her Maie&s;ties enemies. For &s;uch her Maie&s;tie doth iudge the &s;aid kings rebels to be, in that they haue and doe to their power, declare them&s;elues to be ene|mies
<PB REF="2"> to her Maie&s;tie and her Subiectes, as by their ho&s;tile actions again&s;t her Maie&s;ties &s;ubiectes, hath in many partes manife&s;tly appeared. As in like &s;orte al&s;o the king of Scottes her good brother, and a friend and auncient Allie to the Crowne of France, hath publiquely declared him&s;elfe an enemie to the &s;aid rebels, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> prohibited his Subiects from trading in any &s;orte with the rebels of Fraunce: notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of the heads of the rebellion, to his great mi&s;liking, are by the hou&s;e of Lorraine of kinred to him.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e her Maie&s;tie is informed, that though many of her &s;ecretly euill di&s;po&s;ed &s;ubiects do outward|lie &s;hew them&s;elues not to haue a minde to repaire to the ports po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the fore&s;aid Rebels, but colourably doe in her Maie&s;ties ports lade their wares, and make their entries with the officers of the Cu&s;tomehou&s;es, and take their cockets, as thereby to carrie the &s;ame to the ports of France which are knowen to obey the French king: Or &s;ometimes lading of vitailes, make their entries to repaire only to other ports of the realme, and &s;ometimes to the i&s;les of Iern&s;ey or Garn&s;ey, and yet mo&s;t corruptly, and again&s;t their loyaltie, for gaine or other corruption, they doe craftily repaire with the &s;aid merchandi&s;e and vitailes, yea and by &s;tealth with munition, as pouder, &s;hot, copper, and other habi&s;lements of warre, to the ports manife&s;tly held by the Rebels: For repre&s;&s;ing of which abu&s;e, her Maie&s;tie chargeth and commandeth all her officers of her Cu|&s;tomehou&s;es, to haue good regard to the conditions of all that &s;hall lade any wares to be tran&s;ported out of the realme by &s;ea, or of vitaile from port to port. And if they &s;hall haue any &s;u&s;pition that the &s;aid wares or vitailes &s;o to be laden, might be carried to the Rebels townes in France, they &s;hall not &s;uffer any &s;uch to depart with their lading, except the owners and laders &s;hall both by their corporall othe, and by bond with &s;ureties to the double value of the things laden, giue a&s;&s;urance, and cleere them&s;elues of all &s;u&s;pition, that no part of their la|ding &s;hall by them, or by any for them, be carried to any towne of the Rebels in France. And if any offi|cers of the ports &s;hall hereafter know, or be informed of any being either the merchant, the owner, or the ma|&s;ter of the &s;hippe, or &s;ailer, that &s;hall offend to the contrary of this her Maie&s;ties proclamation, and &s;hall not &s;peedily giue notice thereof to the Lord Trea&s;urer of England, or to the Lords of the Priuie councell, to the in|tent the per&s;ons offending, and the &s;hips al&s;o may be apprehended: &s;uch officer for concealing thereof, &s;hall lo&s;e all offices in the port for euer, and &s;hall &s;uffer clo&s;e impri&s;onment one whole yeere without baile, and yeeld &s;uch fine to her Maie&s;tie, as his condition may endure. And if any Viceadmirall or his deputie, &s;hall know, or be informed of any per&s;on that &s;hall offend to the contrary of this proclamation, and &s;hall not &s;peedily giue notice thereof to the Lord Admirall, or in the Fiue ports to the Lord Warden, or to the Priuie councell: the &s;ame per|&s;on &s;o concealing the &s;ame, &s;hall loo&s;e his office for euer, and &s;uffer clo&s;e impri&s;onment the &s;pace of one whole yere, and likewi&s;e yeeld &s;uch fine, as his condition &s;hall endure.</P>
