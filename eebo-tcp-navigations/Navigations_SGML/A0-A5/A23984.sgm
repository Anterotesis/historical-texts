<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have given me &s;ufficient a&s;&s;u|rances of the continuance of your Friend&s;hip in the Letter I now re|ceived from you, and by the earne&s;t de&s;ire you expre&s;s of being informed by me of what our Sentiments are in <HI>Poland,</HI> concern|ing the pre&s;ent Troubles in <HI>Hungary.</HI> The common report, you &s;ay, accu&s;es the French of having rai&s;ed the War with the <HI>Turk;</HI> and making u&s;e of <HI>Poland</HI> to &s;et its Engines at Work, and put in execution its pernicious De&s;igns. If you are of the &s;ame Opinion with our <HI>Polanders,</HI> I &s;hall tell you, with my accu&s;tomed freedom, that you do not wholly wrong them; For it is true that my
<PB N="2" REF="3">Country-men, for &s;ome years pa&s;t have &s;uf|fered them&s;elves to be over-reacht by the <HI>French,</HI> and that by treating with them too ingenuou&s;ly, they have in&s;en&s;ibly been drawn in to bear a part with them in their evil Practices; and among others, in favour|ing the Malecontents in <HI>Hungary.</HI> They acknowledge at pre&s;ent, though perhaps too late, their Errour, and begin to fear le&s;t they have purcha&s;ed to them&s;elves Enemies, who after they have filled their own Country with De&s;olation, their Ambition and Bar|barity may make them turn their Arms again&s;t <HI>Poland.</HI> Sir, we love our &s;elves, and our Friend&s;hip cannot con&s;i&s;t with tho&s;e Peo|ples Maximes. Their Politiques appear to us &s;o much the more criminal, becau&s;e there is no ju&s;t revenge, but that which ob|liges us to fight our Enemies with our Arms in our Hands, and openly; nor any &s;o ba&s;e, as that which makes us u&s;e wicked Devi&s;es, and execrable Trea&s;ons as the In&s;truments of their Ruine. I have a great e&s;teem for the <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> becau&s;e they had this good Quality, that they never &s;uffered their &s;u&s;|pitions to prevail again&s;t any Mans credit, and that they cho&s;e always rather to judge of others according to their own Inclinations, than upon bare conjectures think them ca|pable
<PB N="3" REF="3">of Malice. And I beg of you, Sir, to afford me the &s;ame Ju&s;tice, at &s;uch time as at the Diet of <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> you unravel <HI>Pene|lopes</HI> weaving, and condemn my Countri|mens wicked Politicks. I grant you, that the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> that by their caballing and Seditiou&s;ne&s;s have been bani&s;hed their Coun|try, have found in <HI>Poland</HI> both refuge and Friends to protect them. I ea&s;ily al&s;o acknow|ledge, that the original of all the Evils you complain of, has its ri&s;e from an abu&s;e of the Liberty that we have in <HI>Germany.</HI> You may al&s;o reckon up &s;o many Factions and Parties, whether in Peace or War, as there are lit|tle Kings, that in the&s;e la&s;t Ages have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to the Royal Authority, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their Throne in the mid&s;t of <HI>Ger|many.</HI> Now after this, you ought not to be &s;urprized to &s;ee that our Governours have granted the Favour of Ho&s;pitality to tho&s;e that complained that their Liberty was ta|ken from them in their Country, and that all Laws were violated to oppre&s;s them in the highe&s;t degree; &s;ince humanity it &s;elf, and the right of Neighbourhood could not let them refu&s;e to admit them, till &s;uch time as they were reconciled to the Emperour the Sovereign and Ma&s;ter. It may yet be pre|&s;umed that the <HI>French</HI> protected them,
<PB N="4" REF="4">thinking there was &s;ome merit in protect|ing the Mi&s;erable oppre&s;&s;ed. I am al&s;o of Opinion, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> were per&s;uaded to &s;uffer among them&s;elves tho&s;e that came from <HI>Hungary</HI> bani&s;hed their Country, and deprived of their Goods, upon thoughts of pre&s;erving them to the Empire and Chri&s;ti|anity; and to the end that their De&s;pair might not oblige them to have recour&s;e to the <HI>Turk,</HI> to obtain his Protection. If it was the <HI>French</HI> De&s;ign in the&s;e la&s;t Wars of <HI>Germany</HI> to draw more bu&s;ine&s;s upon the Emperour, and divide his Forces; it ought to be remembred that we are not to mind in an Enemy either craft, or violence. How|ever, I condemn that way of proceeding, which occa&s;ioned them to bear an Enemies Heart in time of Peace; and have a Horrour at their fomenting the troubles of <HI>Hungary</HI> with their Forces and Coun&s;el. This Ma|nagement breaks the mo&s;t &s;acred bonds of Friend&s;hip and Peace. So have I always, and many others with me, thought it very ill that <HI>Frenchmen</HI> &s;hould go out of our Coun|try, as it were out of the <HI>Trojan Hor&s;e,</HI> to go as Spies into <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> for to rai&s;e Troubles, and encourage the di&s;|contented &s;o much the more by giving them Mony and Arms. All <HI>Europe</HI> knows how
<PB N="5" REF="4"><HI>Bohancy,</HI> the Head of the Rebels of <HI>Tran&s;ylva|nia,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>French</HI> of the &s;ame Leven, famous for their Crimes committed in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> run up and down to rai&s;e Seditions, and join them&s;elves to the Rebels. How|ever, the unviolable ob&s;ervance due to &s;o &s;olemn a Treaty of Peace, made me doubt, whether <HI>France</HI> did Authori&s;e this Conduct; and I could no longer fix my Su&s;picions up|on the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, when I reflect|ed, it has alwayes been fatal to Sovereigns, by many Examples, to reduce Subjects to Revolt, or to maintain or protect them when they have ro&s;e again&s;t their Lawful Prince. Be&s;ides, I was never &s;o bold or ra&s;h as to cry down the Glory of Kings and Sovereigns; and I can &s;ay, that if Fortune had been an|&s;werable to my Government, having never offended any Body in my life, I &s;hould be very happy. The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, by the for|tunate Succe&s;s of his Arms, the greatne&s;s of his Exploits and Victories, has rai&s;ed his Glory to &s;o high a Pitch, that he ought on|ly to u&s;e it with moderation, and it is need|le&s;s for him to u&s;e unworthy artifices for to make him&s;elf more Glorious. Souls truly Royal and Magnanimous, have always de|&s;pi&s;ed the Conque&s;ts they could more ea&s;ily obtain by Cunning than by force of Arms.
<PB N="6" REF="5">And it was through this &s;entiment, worthy a great Heart, that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great &s;harply rebuked his Favourite <HI>Parmenio,</HI> who would have put him upon a crafty De|&s;ign, &s;aying to him, That it was fit only for Robbers to have recour&s;e to Treachery, as their only means to compa&s;s their Thefts. Neverthele&s;s, becau&s;e the Mini&s;ters of Prin|ces are People more zealous in their Em|ployments than they &s;hould be, and hold that they may lawfully commit all &s;orts of Inju&s;tice for their Sovereign's intere&s;t, provi|ded at the &s;ame time they do their bu&s;ine&s;s; I thought it might po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ame in <HI>France.</HI> The better to a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf in this belief, I would be informed by tho&s;e Gen|tlemen, that keep the Bank here of the <HI>French</HI> mony (for we never want &s;ome <HI>Po|landers,</HI> who had rather live under the <HI>French</HI> Slavery, than be &s;atisfied with the liberty of <HI>Poland</HI>) what great concerns the <HI>French</HI> had with the Duke of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania, Apafi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI> &s;o much con&s;trained to the <HI>Turks</HI> Party, what were the De&s;igns and Intenti|ons, and to what end was &s;o much com|ing and going of <HI>Akakia, Du Vernay Boucauld,</HI> and all the other Expre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, I found they gave no other Rea|&s;on, but that the <HI>French</HI> were at pre&s;ent in
<PB N="7" REF="5">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and going through all Countrys, that they found every where Friends and Allies; and that they were at la&s;t arrived at the time of fulfilling the de&s;ire they had long had of &s;eeing them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all the World. This is it the&s;e <HI>French</HI> Prophets boa&s;t of, founding their hopes and preten&s;i|ons upon this ground, that there is no other way of oppo&s;ing the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which a&s;pires to the entire Monarchy of all <HI>Europe,</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> King's entring into a League with the <HI>Turk,</HI> and there making an Alli|ance, and joyning their Forces by vertue of a Treaty, confirmed with an Oath taken upon the Holy <HI>Evangeli&s;ts;</HI> but this you may learn better from the Original; as if it could ever be ju&s;tifiable to revenge one in|jury with another wrong done to all Chri|&s;tendome, and the De&s;truction of our Holy Mother the Church.</P>
<P>Having asked the&s;e French-men, what Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> it was that di&s;turbed <HI>France</HI> for this <HI>&V;niver&s;al Monarchy,</HI> they knew not which to name; this makes me believe, that tho&s;e who judge of the pre|&s;ent by what is pa&s;t, will without doubt &s;ay that the French and Turks have long ago agreed; and that the French Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> has no greater bu&s;ine&s;s with the
<PB N="8" REF="6"><HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, than to in&s;truct him about the Emperors Negotiations in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as a Famous <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;aid before me, and that the &s;ecret intention of the French, is to draw the War into tho&s;e Provinces of the King|dom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> that remain as yet undivi|ded; to extend, when they &s;hall think fit, their Dominions on the other &s;ide, through the Ruin of Nations, and De&s;truction of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>However, the French Party every where exclaim, and ask, what advantage can the lo&s;s of <HI>Hungary</HI> produce to <HI>LEWIS THE GREAT?</HI> They &s;ay on the contrary, the King endeavours to pre&s;erve it in its obedi|ence to the Emperour, and that his Maje&s;ty has given &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of it to the chiefe&s;t Princes in <HI>Europe;</HI> when <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> being attacked on all &s;ides, and ready to Sur|render, he left the Conque&s;t of that impor|tant Town, to which he has a ju&s;t Claim, as &s;oon as he knew that they were inform|ed at <HI>Vienna,</HI> by an extraordinary Courtier, that the Turk was bringing all his Forces again&s;t the Empire, and had ordered his Army to March towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> with a De&s;ign to Invade in this War all <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Neighbouring Provinces to <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> That the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King had given a
<PB N="9" REF="6">&s;ignal demon&s;tration of his Piety, in not hindring, as very advantagiou&s;ly he could, the Emperour, and the re&s;t whom the &s;ame misfortune threatned, from turn|ing all their force upon the Enemy, and in withdrawing his Troops that were in <HI>Flan|ders</HI> and upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI> We all admired, and highly extolled a Conduct &s;o Glorious, &s;o Pious, and &s;o worthy a great Monarch, that would at &s;o high a Rate purcha&s;e the peace and quiet of Chri&s;tendom; and with|out doubt the French that had come after|wards, had received &s;incere Prai&s;es, if the thing had really been, or but always appear|ed the &s;ame they repre&s;ented it to us, but, prai&s;ed be God, the Truth did not always lye hid under the &s;pecious pretences with which it was covered.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by all examples of pa&s;t ages, and only &s;ay, that after their actions in the&s;e latter times, there is no more doubt to be made of their &s;ini&s;ter dealings. And to be fully &s;atisfied in this point, it is only ne|ce&s;&s;ary to hear tho&s;e that are be&s;t in&s;truct|ed in the cau&s;es of this rumour which I &s;pread abroad. They &s;ay, that all their exactne&s;s in di&s;covering of News has not been able to inform them that any acci|dent had happened which &s;hould give occa|&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="7">to the <HI>Turk</HI> to make a War either in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Greece, The&s;&s;aly,</HI> or any of his re|mote Provinces; that neverthele&s;s at the &s;ame time they have &s;een in &s;everal Letters of the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, which were di&s;per|&s;ed in <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Tran&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Hun|gary;</HI> how that la&s;t year, on the 30th of <HI>De|cember,</HI> the War was re&s;olved upon and &s;worn to again&s;t the Emperour, in the Pa|lace of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and in the Holy Council, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Divan,</HI> in which the Muphti, High Prie&s;t of the <HI>Ma|hometan</HI> Religion pre&s;ided. Which &s;uffi|ciently lays open the Authors and Procurers of this War; and clearly &s;hews us that the <HI>French</HI> were not a&s;hamed, as if it had been a famous action in them, to take advice in the <HI>Divan,</HI> and applaud the &s;ucce&s;s of the Negotiations, as they did in their Letters writ backwards and forwards to the Rebels, in which they congratulated with them for having drawn the <HI>Turk</HI> to &s;uccour them. They promi&s;e each other in their Letters all the advantages they can expect, which aim at no le&s;s than to have the Emperour driven out of his be&s;t E&s;tates, and the <HI>Turk</HI> advance into <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> be&s;towing Crowns on the one &s;ide, and rewards on the other, ac|cording as every one &s;hall have laboured with him for the freeing of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<P>I lay not the &s;tre&s;s of this upon any fal&s;e rumour that has run among the People; I have a&s;&s;ured and convincing te&s;timonies of it; and the Per&s;ons from whom I take it, de&s;erve we &s;hould make it a point of Con|&s;cience faithfully to believe them.</P>
<P>Sir, if you &s;u&s;pended as yet your judge|ment upon the <HI>French,</HI> on account of what I have told you; and if you &s;hould as yet per&s;i&s;t in your belief, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> have had a hand in all this with the <HI>French;</HI> I would de&s;ire you to examine with that ju&s;tice, which in you is u&s;ual, whether what I have related unto you is not &s;ufficient to rai&s;e all your &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>There is no body but knows that in la&s;t years a&s;&s;embly, our illu&s;trious <HI>Hungarians</HI> loudly proclaimed, that &s;uch of their Coun|try-men, as have been forced to retire to other Places, lived only upon &s;uch &s;upplies of Mony, as they received from the <HI>French;</HI> that they would not make their Peace with the Emperor, who&s;e Clemency extended but ju&s;t &s;o far as to offer it, and that they were re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute their enterprize, upon a&s;&s;urance of the Promi&s;es that were made them. So afterwards <HI>Akakia</HI> renewed and confirmed more powerfully than ever the League and Alliance with the Malecon|tents
<PB N="12" REF="8">of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI> We al&s;o &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries without any &s;hame of violating the Law of Nations, and in Countries of the &s;olemn Treaty of Peace; though they had been manife&s;tly di&s;covered in a &s;ecret Con|&s;piracy, run on afterwards more then ever, with an unparallelled Impudence, as if all things had been lawful to them.</P>
<P>You that know me, may well imagine what a trouble it was to me, to &s;ee that <HI>Po|land,</HI> my Country, &s;hould be the Theatre where all the&s;e Villanies were acted, and not one <HI>Polander</HI> to be found who might unde|ceive the World.</P>
<P>Yet the Emperor, with his ordinary Mer|cy, &s;uffered the Malecontents of <HI>Hungary</HI> to pa&s;s the next Water with as much quiet and &s;ecurity as they would de&s;ire, to the end to draw them by this affectionate con|duct to lay down Arms, return to their Du|ty, and live peaceably in their Country un|der obedience; and I thought they would then for ever have left their Rebellion, if the Artifices of the French had permitted them to take good coun&s;el.</P>
<P>We have been inform'd, how 100000 Florins were ordered at <HI>Paris</HI> to foment the Di&s;content of the Rebels in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and quicken the <HI>Turks</HI> the more; How this Sum
<PB N="13" REF="8">was delivered at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> the Metropolis of Royal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and put into the Hands of a Banker, who&s;e Name is <HI>Fromontius,</HI> who afterwards delivered it to the French Emi&s;&s;a|ries, at &s;everal payments, the better to hide the bu&s;ine&s;s. Moreover, we knew, how the <HI>Sieur du Vernay Boucauld,</HI> Count <HI>Teckely</HI>'s real Spy, cau&s;ed to be delivered into the hands of the Sieur <HI>Valentin Neme&s;&s;an,</HI> 11300 Ducats, to oblige the Malecontents to take Arms again, and attack the Cittadel of <HI>Zat|mar,</HI> after the French fa&s;hion, with gilt Ar|rows, I mean, to endeavour to gain the Ga|ri&s;on, or Citizens, with money.</P>
<P>You knew, Sir, that in <HI>Poland,</HI> we highly di&s;approved of this Conduct, which was not totally unknown. The Principal Officers of our Court, before the whole Court, repre|&s;ented to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's Amba&s;|&s;adour, that we would no longer allow of &s;uch things. We told them, that by order of the whole Senate, we forbid the French to act, as we under&s;tood they lately had done, upon pain of our King's di&s;plea&s;ure. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Vitry</HI> endeavoured to excu&s;e him|&s;elf, he produced his Book, a&s;&s;uring us, that we &s;hould not find in all his Accounts that the Malecontents in <HI>Hungary</HI> had touched the money we &s;poke of, and which was all
<PB N="14" REF="9">delivered by his Order. Thus it is that De|ceit and Craft hide the Truth under fal&s;e pretences.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding you mu&s;t know, that the French Money went into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and men have been employed on purpo&s;e to &s;top it; and even the very Women have not been ignorant of the Wiles and Practi&s;es of the French.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s <HI>Radrivilliana,</HI> Widow to the Prince of that name, expre&s;ly forbid the &s;uf|fering any French to pa&s;s through her Coun|try of <HI>Sacolia,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> fearing le&s;t they &s;hould, as in other places, corrupt the People with mony. Neverthele&s;s the French, whether it was that they would venture all, or whether they thought they were &s;ufficiently di&s;gui&s;ed not to be known, took their Journey through this Prince&s;s's hereditary Country, and one that was taken was carried to her Ca&s;tle, whom &s;he impri|&s;oned, loaded with Irons, and afterwards cau&s;ed to be &s;everely puni&s;hed. The Mar|que&s;s <HI>De Vitri,</HI> as well as all the Court, &s;aw this man run backwards and forwards, be|ing obliged to take another way. This ge|nerous Prince&s;s's Example may convince the World that there were tho&s;e in <HI>Poland,</HI> who condemned the abominable practi&s;es of the French.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<P>All the world would have thought, that after this the <HI>Sieur du Vernay</HI> and all his un|der Spies would have grown circum&s;pect by the puni&s;hment of their Companion, or that at lea&s;t they would have learnt to conceal them&s;elves better. But on the contrary, they made it appear by their new behavi|our, that when once a man has gone be|yond the bounds of Honour he is fit for any thing. The&s;e Gentlemen, the Ma&s;ters of Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, perceived, that they had no fairer a convenience for to entertain a commerce with the French Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the Turks, and Malecontents in <HI>Hungary,</HI> than that which they found on the borders of <HI>Poland.</HI> They always had cor|re&s;pondence, and had as often as they could private enterviews with the Sieurs <HI>Valentin Neme&s;&s;an, Peter Iagel,</HI> and other particular Friends and Allies of <HI>Teckely.</HI> They more|over endeavoured to have &s;till more and more frequent Conferences in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> &s;ending fir&s;t one and then another to <HI>Paris,</HI> with the nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions of all their Proceedings.</P>
<P>So the Emperour's Amba&s;&s;adour at this Court, who had notice of all, de&s;ired our mo&s;t Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> that his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to give order, that no
<PB N="16" REF="10">French-man, not being an Amba&s;&s;adour, or bearing &s;ome other Employment, &s;hould be allowed to &s;tay in his Dominions. He added to his Entreaty the humble Remon&s;trance, that the ancient Treaties &s;o often renewed between the Empire and <HI>Poland,</HI> required it for the publick Peace, neither did he omit what he had under&s;tood concerning the Be|haviour of the French in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;tantinople.</HI> This occa&s;ioned that the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's Emba&s;&s;ador was advertized by his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland,</HI> to order <HI>Akakia</HI> and <HI>Du Vernay</HI> to withdraw. At the &s;ame time he received a &s;evere Animadver&s;ion about tho&s;e Peoples Behaviour. The Senate told him, that we were no longer upon terms of conniving, &s;ince we had been informed, that the French more and more &s;tirted up the Troubles of <HI>Hungary,</HI> to draw on a War with the <HI>Turk;</HI> that we knew from good hands what Mony they had given for it, what Ca|bals they had had, and the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> kept every day. We declared that Man was a Spy, and a turbulent Per&s;on, who had no other bu&s;ine&s;s to detain him about <HI>Leopol,</HI> but only to treat with the <HI>Turks</HI> and Male|contents, about the means and entring into a League together, for to draw the War in|to <HI>Hungary;</HI> that therefore we earne&s;tly de|&s;ired
<PB N="17" REF="10">he would cau&s;e him to retire. The Amba&s;&s;ador an&s;wered, that he would not do what we demanded; he loudly declared, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> was &s;ent with him into <HI>Poland,</HI> to manage the Affairs of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King their Ma&s;ter. He pre&s;umed very confidently to deny, that neither the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> nor he, had any commerce with the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> or <HI>Turks;</HI> on the con|trary, he &s;aid, that the French King, in lea|ving <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> had &s;ufficiently te&s;tified how earne&s;tly he de&s;ired the Peace of Chri&s;ten|dom, much le&s;s to give an occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;|pecting the French of any &s;ini&s;ter De&s;ign. He promi&s;ed however, to take away, as he &s;aid, all Su&s;pitions, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> &s;hould go to <HI>Varovia,</HI> and that there he &s;hould execute his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ties com|mands. However, the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> upon the news of all the&s;e Accu&s;ations, had re|tired to a Convent of Schi&s;matick Monks of the order of St. <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI> And this did not put an end to the&s;e Practices, &s;o unworthy the name of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Some time after, the Emperours Amba&s;&s;a|dour di&s;covered that new &s;ums of Mony were come to <HI>Dantzick</HI> for the French. This and many other things which he under&s;tood at the &s;ame time, obliged him to renew his Pray|ers
<PB N="18" REF="11">to his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland.</HI> He had Audi|ence in the Pre&s;ence of the Marque&s;s <HI>De Vi|try,</HI> the French Emba&s;&s;ador, and before the whole Senate. He &s;poke a long time, and all his Speech con&s;i&s;ted of Complaints again&s;t the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay.</HI> He &s;aid, he had only changed the Place, and not his way of Pro|ceeding, and &s;till daily continued his Crafts in <HI>Poland.</HI> He produced a Paper he had recei|ved by the la&s;t Po&s;t; by which he was given to under&s;tand, that the remainder of the Mony the French had engaged for to the Rebels, by the agreement made between them of one hundred thou&s;and Florins, was lately delivered at <HI>Dantzick.</HI> He ended, be|&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland,</HI> to be plea|&s;ed now at la&s;t to purge his Dominions of tho&s;e dangerous and &s;editious Men, who by all means fomented the Troubles of <HI>Hungary.</HI> He &s;aid, the Mi&s;eries of <HI>Hungary</HI> would reach <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;ince the Toleration they had, ten|ded to the Violation of the Treaty of Peace, till now always inviolably ob&s;erved. He pro|te&s;ted, if we gave not &s;atisfaction to his de|mands, he &s;hould be obliged to publi&s;h in all Princes Courts, and would make known to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the French, by their abo|minable Methods and Practi&s;es, are the Au|thors of the Troubles of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="11">and cau&s;e of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> War. That they have &s;acrificed to their hatred, and en|vy again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the be&s;t purcha&s;ed Provinces of the Empire, in which they have exerci&s;ed their Treacheries and Trea&s;ons. That they have done all this to make good their ground in the Provinces they have torn from the Empire, and which they cannot retain by any other lawful right. In a word, that their aim in all the&s;e Proceed|ings is only to renew the Treaty of Peace, up|on pretence that we have broke it, to the end they may the better retain their U&s;ur|pations, and have an occa&s;ion of &s;eizing what is left of the Empire.</P>
<P>This Speech was convincing, and we could do no le&s;s than to pre&s;s anew the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour to oblige the Sieur <HI>de Vernay</HI> to depart <HI>Poland:</HI> We told him from the King and Senate, that we would no longer be &s;atisfied with the vain pre|tences he alledged to detain him. Then Mon&s;ieur the Marquis <HI>de Vitry</HI> declared, (which he dur&s;t not do the la&s;t time) that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Du &V;ernay Boucauld,</HI> was joint Emba&s;&s;adour with him from the <HI>French</HI> King. He came thus far to &s;ave him by the quality of Emba&s;&s;adour, &s;heltering him under the Law of Nations.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="12">
<P>This Declaration &s;topt our <HI>Polander</HI>'s mouths; they thought no more of demand|ing the departure of him that was the real Author of the Rebellion of <HI>Hungary;</HI> and they &s;poke not the lea&s;t word to put a &s;top to his licentiou&s;ne&s;s by a ju&s;t advice: On the contrary, they promi&s;ed the Emba&s;&s;a|dour, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> his pre|tended Companion, &s;hould have all liberty to act for his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This &s;oft and complying behaviour of the <HI>Polanders</HI> cannot be better excu&s;ed, than by &s;aying, that without doubt they remembred upon this occa&s;ion, that the <HI>French</HI> of late years, make no greater com|plaint, than when their Emba&s;&s;adours or Agents, that have liberty in all Countries, are touched, though never &s;o &s;lightly.</P>
<P>(The&s;e are the words of <HI>Charles Pa&s;cal,</HI> a <HI>French-man,</HI> in his Treati&s;e he made of Emba&s;&s;ies.) "And they do like the Wolfs, who draw the Sheep far from the Shepherd, that they may afterwards devour them. In fine, it is upon the&s;e frivolous accu&s;ations, that the <HI>French,</HI> to have &s;ome pretence for making War, have at other times &s;o loud|ly complained, and not long &s;ince, again&s;t <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;aying, They ob&s;erved not the law of Nations, and broke the mo&s;t &s;acred
<PB N="21" REF="12">bonds of Humanity, and the Peace to|wards their Emba&s;&s;adors. Yet at the &s;ame time, they pa&s;&s;ed by and endured, with|out one word &s;peaking, the horrid injuries and mo&s;t barbarous u&s;age their Emba&s;&s;a|dours received at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs tell you here, Sir, that if you wonder that we &s;uffer the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;|&s;aries in <HI>Poland,</HI> under the pretended qua|lity of an Emba&s;&s;adour; we have much more rea&s;on to admire in <HI>Poland</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> are received in the principal Courts in <HI>Germany</HI> with great kindne&s;s and &s;atisfa|ction, notwith&s;tanding there is &s;o much rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t their intentions.</P>
<P>This makes me think, dear Sir, that even at this day we might &s;ee the ob&s;ervance of the Laws, the love of your Country, the love and re&s;pect due to the Emperour, in which you were &s;o exact the la&s;t age, &s;ub|&s;i&s;t among&s;t you, if the French had not been the fir&s;t in changing this good order, by conjuring with the <HI>Turks.</HI> Then, 'tis true, a Law made in a Diet was publi&s;h|ed in <HI>Germany;</HI> by which all &s;ort of com|merce with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> their Confederates, was forbidden through the whole Empire; to hinder the &s;prouting of the &s;eeds of Divi&s;ion and Rebellion,
<PB N="22" REF="13">which that perfidious Nation ca&s;&s;s where|ever it is admitted. Since no <HI>French</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adour was admitted in any one Court in <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;o little did they tru&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> and &s;carce would the Princes of the Empire receive Letters from that Coun|try. Now things are much changed, and we may well cry, when we &s;ee the pre&s;ent mi&s;eries of <HI>Germany, O tempora! O mores!</HI></P>
<P>Yet all the World has not the &s;ame opi|nion of the French. But to convince you, I will give you an example &s;o much the more to be imitated, becau&s;e it would be extremely advantagious to <HI>Germany,</HI> if the &s;ame were done there. It happened in <HI>Po|land,</HI> The Ca&s;tellan of <HI>Primi&s;lau,</HI> percei|ving that neither his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland,</HI> nor the Senate expelled the French Spies, and moreover that their de&s;igns always &s;uc|ceeded better and better, and that they were going to de&s;troy, by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> War they were drawing on, a million of innocent Chri&s;tians, refu&s;ed to permit the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> to enter his Village of <HI>Nimirovia,</HI> and a&s;&s;embled a number of men to oblige him to pa&s;s another way; &s;o much did he fear this man, of whom he had heard &s;o many things.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="13">
<P>There wanted not for great complaints. The Marquis <HI>de Vitry</HI> was highly incen&s;ed, and &s;ought all ways of revenge. And as he is the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's Emba&s;&s;a|dour, went directly to Court, to lay before his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Poland,</HI> after his own fa&s;hion, the affront and indignity offered, contrary to the Law of Nations, to his Companion, the Sieur <HI>du Vernay;</HI> and was &s;o bold as to demand that the Ca&s;tellan &s;hould be impri|&s;oned for &s;atisfaction. The King could not endure this confidence, and told him very har&s;hly, That it was to no purpo&s;e to couch the Sieur <HI>du Vernay</HI> under the quality of Amba&s;&s;adour, that the Tragedies he acted under the vain pretence of an Emba&s;&s;y were well known; that all the devices of the French, and their contracts with the Turk were di&s;covered; that the places where <HI>Akakia</HI> and <HI>du Vernay</HI> had Conferences were named; their re&s;olutions and de&s;igns known; that we could exactly tell how much Mo|ney was &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Hungary;</HI> and how they had u&s;ed violence, deceit, and wicked practices again&s;t the Emperour, to the misfortune of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adour would have cleared him&s;elf of tho&s;e things, with which, he &s;aid, we wrongfully charged his Nation. He
<PB N="24" REF="14">thought there was no body could convict the French of their actions in this Country. But the King, who grew hot, would not hear him. He only told him, he would lay 10000 Pi&s;tols with him, that we would prove un|deniably all that he had &s;aid:</P>
<P>I tell you nothing here, Sir, but what I have &s;een and heard, and if you had been pre&s;ent, you would have thought with me, you had heard <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;peak in the Roman Senate, in&s;tead of the King of <HI>Poland, How long,</HI> Catiline, <HI>will you abu&s;e our patience? How long &s;hall your fury &s;port at us? to what end will your impudence come? are you igno|rant that all your De&s;igns are known to us? don't you perceive that all my Citizens are con|vinced of the Con&s;piracy you carry on with the Malecontents of</HI> Hungary <HI>and the</HI> Turks?</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Vitry</HI> pre&s;&s;ed no farther for the liberty of the French Agents. He did not, like <HI>Catiline,</HI> pray we &s;hould not enter|tain tho&s;e thoughts of him and his, which no Body believ'd; that when <HI>Hungary</HI> were lo&s;t, we &s;hould have need of the French. He look|ed like one a&s;toni&s;hed at this blow. He &s;tood amazed, and his &s;ilence &s;ufficiently confirm|ed the thing. All the other French that were pre&s;ent, in a con&s;ternation, fixed their Eyes upon the ground, and lifted them not up but
<PB N="25" REF="14">to look upon each other, as it were accu&s;ing them&s;elves. So certain it is, that the inward &s;ting of Con&s;cience, and the &s;ecret power of Truth, da&s;hes the mo&s;t fierce and confident, and by reducing the guilty to a &s;hameful &s;i|lence, forces them to make &s;ome &s;ort of con|fe&s;&s;ion of their Crimes.</P>
<P>Sir, Here you have a very acceptable Hi|&s;tory to tell &s;uch of your Countrymen as can well prai&s;e all the French actions, whether good or bad. Next, you may ask them, whether they expect a good Peace with the French, becau&s;e they &s;o highly extoll the advantages and plea&s;ures of Peace.</P>
<P>If the Gho&s;t of the Emperour <HI>Tiberius</HI> &s;hould come from Hell, and appear in you a&s;&s;embly of the States of the Empire, how ju&s;tly would he blame you, and &s;ay, <HI>O men, born to &s;lavery! will your &s;oftne&s;s extend &s;o far as not to believe, but that we only imagine what is done openly in &s;ight of the whole world, which we &s;ee, and even feel.</HI> This I &s;ay, becau&s;e I know there are &s;ome among&s;t you, that &s;uf|ficiently mi&s;tru&s;t the French, to know what they are to think of them, whether they &s;u&s;pect them for not ob&s;erving the Peace, or for entring into a League with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>But I al&s;o believe, which is much better, that there are many <HI>Germans,</HI> who will talk
<PB N="26" REF="15">boldly of taking away the &s;nares that are laid for them, and endeavouring to defend the liberty of their Country. I &s;till remember what I &s;aw in <HI>Germany</HI> when I travelled in it. At lea&s;t I doubt not, but that if you would Unite your &s;elves to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the glory of <HI>Germany,</HI> and retain the valour of your Ance&s;tors, you might live at home like Kings, and laugh at tho&s;e who have made them&s;elves &s;laves to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But what &s;ide mu&s;t be taken in &s;o great a diver&s;ity of Opinions, and among &s;o many occa&s;ions of fear on both &s;ides. My opinion is little to the purpo&s;e, but if you will believe me, you would judge, that you have mo&s;t rea&s;on to fear what threatens you from the Ea&s;t, than from any other place. For what can you expect from a War with the <HI>Turk</HI> but the total ruin of your Goods, and utter de&s;truction of your Countrey. There is an end of your Liberty, your Religion, your Life, and all you can lo&s;e in this World.</P>
<P>So that &s;ince you have &s;till time to con|&s;ider what you are to do, imagine &s;ome|times your Churches, your Hou&s;es, your Wives, your Children and your Country, comming to you and conjuring by all they have de&s;erved from you, that you will not leave them as a prey to your common Ene|mies,
<PB N="27" REF="15">and to prevent the Mi&s;eries of a cruel &s;lavery that threatens their Liberty.</P>
<P>If you will &s;ay that <HI>Hercules</HI> him&s;elf wont encounter two; that therefore you mu&s;t treat with the French at any rate. You may &s;till think, if you plea&s;e, that the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> is of far greater value and con&s;e|quence, as being the bulwark of Chri&s;ten|dom, than the City of <HI>Strasburg.</HI> That at pre&s;ent you mu&s;t behave your &s;elf like a prudent Pilot in a Storm, who cho&s;es rather to ca&s;t his Merchandi&s;e into the Sea, than venture lo&s;ing all, by endeavouring to pre&s;erve all. But I mu&s;t al&s;o tell you, that you have rea&s;on to fear, le&s;t under tho&s;e beautiful Leaves, a Snake lyes hid. You mu&s;t believe the French have &s;tirred up the <HI>Turks.</HI> And the&s;e &s;hall no &s;ooner have entred <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> be&s;ieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> as without doubt they will be&s;iege it, de&s;troyed all the Country round it; and finally reduced <HI>Germany</HI> to the la&s;t Extremities; but the French, invited by your Prayers, will voluntarily come of|fer you their Service. But in&s;tead of Wa|ter to quench the Fire, they will bring Oyl to make it the fiercer.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall not &s;ay many other things that I think about this matter. I only add, that methinks I &s;ee a Hi&s;tory, almo&s;t the &s;ame
<PB N="28" REF="16">with that we read of a Roman Emperor, who had a Fancy to &s;et on fire the four cor|ners of <HI>Rome</HI> for the Plea&s;ure, as he &s;aid, of &s;eeing a Fire equal to that of <HI>Troy;</HI> and thereby to have an occa&s;ion of doing good to the mi&s;erable Citizens, who would come to complain of their Mi&s;eries and Misfor|tunes. Perhaps <HI>Nero,</HI> in this cruel Scene, de|&s;ired nothing but the Glory of building a new City, and calling it by his own Name.</P>
<P>If you believe me, endeavour above all things to take away the Snares that are laid for you. The French King, as all other Chri&s;tian Princes, is obliged to defend you again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> and you will have &s;o lit|tle trouble in obtaining of it, that he has al|ready agreed upon it with your Enemy. But what will be the event? You will infal|libly come to complain of one another, be|cau&s;e &s;ome will be contented, and others di&s;|&s;atisfied; Whil&s;t you are taken up in the&s;e Di&s;putes, the French will do their Work, and at la&s;t you will find your &s;elves under their Dominion, ca&s;t down, conquered and made Slaves without daring to &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>Do not then &s;tay to di&s;pute Rights and Intere&s;ts, till the time when the noi&s;e of Arms and the fury of War will hinder you from hearing the Law. Be the <HI>Horatii,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="16">and not the <HI>Curatii</HI> of your Country. In fine, remember that the members &s;eparated from the Head langui&s;h away like Carca&s;&s;es. Be faithful to your Soveraign, the Empe|rour, your lawful Prince: He has a&s;cended the Throne by a right owned by all the World; he has always upheld him&s;elf with Glory; you are u&s;ed to obey him, and he always applied him&s;elf to your pre&s;ervation. You ought to pay him all &s;orts of re&s;pect, if you expect in him a Protector and Father, and if you fear drawing the wrath of Hea|ven on your heads. What light would the Planets have if they darkned the Sun? If you prefer the Moon hid under the <HI>Flower|de-Luces</HI> before the Sun at which your <HI>Eagle</HI> looks; if you had rather be &s;laves to the <HI>French</HI> King, than obey the Emperour, all things will happen wor&s;e and wor&s;e to you; and you will draw all the Cruelty of the Barbarians on you, as a puni&s;hment of your Perjury and breach of Faith.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant of the reproach that we ca&s;t upon you, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> are the only people that de&s;ire to be &s;ubject to a Foreign Government, and have no love for their Country.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t Great King,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMong&s;t other Books, I have hit upon that of the Life and Exploits of Cardinal <HI>Commendon</HI> who was &s;ent to this Court by the <HI>Pope,</HI> with the Quality of extraordinary <HI>Legate,</HI> in the Em|pire of <HI>Sigi&s;mond,</HI> and Reign of <HI>Henry de Va|lois:</HI> I have ob&s;erved in it, that it was that Cardinal's Maxim, Never to an&s;wer but with an affected Silence and Contempt, to all that his Enemies could do or &s;ay again&s;t him. Without doubt, in his time, the &s;tate of Affairs, the Cu&s;toms and Spirits were very different from what they now are; at lea&s;t, a long experience has made me judge them very different; and I know I cannot, without great di&s;advantage, conceal or connive at a thing that very much troubles me. I have under&s;tood that the French King's Mini&s;ters, publi&s;hed &s;ome dayes ago, certain Letters, which brought, as it were, a&s;&s;ured Te&s;ti|monies, that His Imperial Maje&s;ties Envoy's only Bu&s;i|ne&s;s with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court was to endeavour, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to turn the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Armies again&s;t <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Body but &s;ees, and your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t needs perceive, how injurious this is to the Empire; and to what end it is done. They give this out to di&s;|unite Two Kingdoms; both which, at this pre&s;ent Con|juncture of Affairs, have their chief Intere&s;t in being firm|ly
<PB N="32" REF="18">united. But the Letters took not &s;o great an effect as they expected. The Spirits of this Court, were not &s;o credulous as to believe them. They are too well &s;atis|fied in <HI>Poland,</HI> of the Piety and Affection of tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> to think that the Emperor, my Ma|&s;ter, gives his Emba&s;&s;adors &s;uch ba&s;e and unworthy Com|mi&s;&s;ions. There is no Body here that can doubt that his Imperial Maje&s;ty, would be as &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s of <HI>Poland</HI> as of <HI>Hungary,</HI> &s;ince it is as much his Intere&s;t to pre&s;erve the one as the other.</P>
<P>I come not hither, great King, to tell you what through my Aver&s;ion, I could publi&s;h upon little Rumours that have been &s;pread among us; I bring your Maje&s;ty tho&s;e things, which I can beyond all di&s;pute, produce before the whole World, as the true Originals of Letters and An&s;wers, which the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's Emba&s;&s;ador, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Du Vernay Boucauld,</HI> who is here pre&s;ent, has writ to Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> the Head of the <HI>Malecontents,</HI> or received from him. The&s;e will evidently di&s;cover to your Maje&s;ty, what Affairs Moun&s;ieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> has Treated about, with &s;o much &s;ecre&s;ie and circum&s;pecti|on with Count <HI>Tekely;</HI> and the rea&s;on he had &s;o cauti|ou&s;ly to conceal from you the Commi&s;&s;ion he had in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>I humbly intreat your Maje&s;ty to remember how ear|ne&s;tly I intreated you, to remove the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> from your Court and Dominions, as a man pernicious to the Empire, and <HI>Poland.</HI> You would have, Great King, invincible Proofs and Te&s;timonies of what I rela|ted; Here they are, &s;uch as you will wi&s;h for, and I am per&s;uaded they will be &s;ufficient to make you judge the &s;peedy departure of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> out of your Kingdom, very nece&s;&s;ary. But I fear, troubling your Ma|je&s;ty with a long Di&s;cour&s;e; I pa&s;s by a thou&s;and things which I could add; this Memorial is enough, To you I pre&s;ent it with all imaginable re&s;pect.</P>

<P>SInce the la&s;t <HI>Memerial</HI> which I had the Honour to pre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty, I have endeavoured, ac|cording to the Advice of the Illu&s;trious Lords of the Senate, to furni&s;h my &s;elf with &s;ome piece that might evidently &s;hew what Corre&s;pondence the <HI>French</HI> King's Agents have in your Kingdom with Count <HI>Tekely,</HI> Head of the Malecontents in <HI>Hungary.</HI> The&s;e wanted al&s;o to inform you, what Bargains and Agreements pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them, which, as I &s;aid, tend to the breaking off the Peace and Treaties, that are between your Maje&s;ty and the Emperor, my Ma&s;ter. You could not ea&s;ily be informed of it from any but my &s;elf. I know the <HI>French</HI> King's Mini&s;ters daily a&s;&s;ur'd your Maje&s;ty, that they had a Hand in no &s;uch thing; and that we accu|&s;ed them fal&s;ely. And the French would no longer be &s;u&s;pected to have any ill De&s;ign again&s;t the Empire, after the Declaration the French King had made, at the rai|&s;ing the Bloccade of <HI>Luxemburg.</HI> His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would inform all <HI>Europe,</HI> how he behaved him|&s;elf in that occa&s;ion; and they were careful to carry his Declaration to all the Courts of the chief Chri&s;tian Princes. The French King plau&s;ibly declares, that having been informed of the De&s;igns which are carrying
<PB N="34" REF="19">on in the <HI>Fa&s;t</HI> again&s;t the Empire, he would put nothing in Execution which might hinder his Imperial Maje&s;ty, and the mo&s;t Augu&s;t Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> from oppo&s;ing the <HI>Turks</HI> with all their Forces, and providing for the com|mon good of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>This could by no means allow your Maje&s;ty to believe, that the <HI>French</HI> were in League with the Maltcontents and <HI>Turks;</HI> and that they contributed to the taking and plundering the Towns of <HI>Hungary;</HI> for that appeared to be quite contrary to &s;uch fair Declarations: But God, the Defender and Revenger of Chri&s;tians, has ordered tho&s;e things to fall into my hands, which I lay at the foot of your Maje&s;ties Throne; and which I lay before the Eyes of the whole World. The&s;e are the Sieur <HI>Da Vernay</HI>'s Letters, and Corre&s;pondence with Count <HI>Tekeley;</HI> which you will find diametrically oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e Declarations, &s;o worthy the Piety and Genero|&s;ity of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.</P>
<P>I have made u&s;e of no evil practice for the obtaining the&s;e Letters: I have not, though I could have done it, &s;o much as employed any Body to ob&s;erve the <HI>French.</HI> And to tell you all, I got the&s;e Letters by the means of the Steward of the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Lord <HI>Stadnick</HI>'s E&s;tate. The Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> after having long im|portuned the Monks of a Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> went al&s;o to importune the Steward, who is <HI>Ca&s;tellan</HI> at <HI>Pre|mi&s;law.</HI> So much he did, that he &s;tirred up the Gen|tlemans Anger again&s;t him&s;elf, and &s;o con&s;equently he became my Friend, and has ever &s;ince been very favour|able to my Intentions. This <HI>Ca&s;tellan,</HI> &s;ome dayes ago, &s;topt certain <HI>Hungarians</HI> coming back from <HI>Nimiravia,</HI> whither they went to &s;ee the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay;</HI> immedi|ately he ordered them to be brought to me, with the Letters he &s;ound about them. I pre&s;ently took care to convey them to the Emperour, my Ma&s;ter's Territories; &s;ending at the &s;ame time the Letters, to the end that all the World might judge, whether I had not ju&s;t cau&s;e to
<PB N="35" REF="19">&s;u&s;pect, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> exceeded his Ma&s;ter's orders.</P>
<P>Certainly, this Agent, this Mini&s;ter, this Spy, this Amba&s;&s;ador, I know not what to call him, but I mean Mon&s;ienr <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> has committed a great outrage again&s;t all Chri&s;tendom. Again&s;t the Emperor, in fo|menting and contriving what he has again&s;t him. Again&s;t your Maje&s;ty, in entertaining a Commerce &s;o unworthy, &s;o pernicious, and for &s;o long a time, without your know|ledge, and in your Kingdom, as if he had been at home. I mu&s;t add, for the Intere&s;t of your Kingdom, that this Conduct has given the World occa&s;ion to believe, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> were blind enough, not to &s;ee the dangers their Neighbours made them fear, and that they would them&s;elves drive the Poniard to their own Brea&s;t, in permitting the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> to live among&s;t them. His proceeding will, without doubt, appear very in|jurious to the French King; for that Po&s;terity may judge and believe, that the great King, <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV, Authorized or commanded, what the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay,</HI> his Agent did in his Name.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty will not take it ill, that we have di&s;co|vered to the A&s;&s;emblies at <HI>Francfort</HI> and <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> the Famous Exploits of the French, with the Turks and Rebels of <HI>Hungary,</HI> in your Kingdom, which for &s;o ma|ny Ages has been clo&s;ely united with the Augu&s;t-Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> and has alwayes acknowledged its own Inte|re&s;t, to pre&s;erve <HI>Hungary</HI> to the Empire, thinking it im|po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Peland</HI> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t if <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;hall &s;all.</P>
<P>It is now a year, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> travels up and down &s;everal Parts of your Maie&s;tjes Dominions, on the Borders of <HI>Hungary.</HI> He always pretends his Ma&s;ters, as if we could &s;ee that <HI>Dantzick</HI> or <HI>Rogioment,</HI> which are the Places the French come through, were not nearer and more proper to receive what Orders the French King would &s;end. But he &s;tays there to ob&s;erve the nearer the Affairs of <HI>Hungary:</HI> It may be al&s;o, to
<PB N="36" REF="20">be in a better condition to go give Count <HI>Tekeley</HI> joy, and to get the reputation with him, of the Progre&s;s the Turks, by his means, might make in that Country.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire your Maje&s;ty, that after you have &s;een the Memorial I pre&s;ent; and after you are convinced of all the Arts the French have u&s;ed in this Kingdom, you will be plea&s;ed to order the Sieur <HI>Da Vernay</HI> to depart your Dominions, &s;ince he abu&s;es his Employments to the prejudice of all Chri&s;tendom; and renders him&s;elf unworthy the Protection the Law of Nations allows.</P>
<P>You may do it &s;o much the more ju&s;tly, great King, becau&s;e the Roman Catholick Church, your Mother, e&s;teems them as Excommunicated Per&s;ons, who &s;ide with Infidels, whether it be carrying them Arms, or treating with them.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> has drawn this upon his own head, and if he is puni&s;hed according to his de&s;erts, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King will bani&s;h him his Kingdom, for ex|ceeding his Orders, and engaging his Ma&s;ter's Honour and Reputation. In fine, he has committed his Villa|nies in the French King's Name, and broke his Ma&s;ter's word; acting in all things contrary to the ob&s;ervance of it, which if it &s;hould fail in the World, could be no where found but in the Mouth of a King or Prince.</P>
<P>I doubt not, great King, but all my pre&s;&s;ing, reite|rated and ju&s;t in&s;tances, will at la&s;t take effect. The Al|liances and Treaties that are between this Kingdom and the Empire, require it from your Maje&s;ty. And I al&s;o, with a mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, beg to be admitted to the honour of &s;ome part of your Affections,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Doubt not, but you have made much of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Valentine Neme&s;&s;ani,</HI> my Envoy. He has alwayes been faithful to me, and very true to my Intere&s;t. The Recommendations you gave him touching the Affairs he
<PB N="39" REF="21">communicated with you; will, without doubt, be of great Importance to him, with the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King. I am beholding to you for all you have done for him, and &s;hall acknowledge it, as occa&s;ion &s;erves: It is time I &s;hould inform you, of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my Affairs. After I had taken <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> and entered &s;ome Forts about it, I went with the Vizier of <HI>Budas</HI> Troops, to attack the Famous Fort of <HI>Filleck:</HI> The Inhabitants re|fu&s;ed, at fir&s;t, to put them&s;elves under my Protection; but after a fortnights Siege, they came to beg I would admit them to Capitulate; I granted them what they asked; which was, that the Garri&s;on, and what other Prople there was, &s;hould go out, carrying with them as much as they could upon their Backs: Then I rai&s;ed the Fort, in &s;ight of the Imperial Army, which was hard by in the Mountains. As I am now informed, it is marched away: and having &s;acked the Town of <HI>Vieux&s;ols,</HI> and other places, retires very ha&s;tily. I de&s;ign to follow the Imperiali&s;ts, and drive them far off, to re&s;tore my Country to its former Liberty. At length the Emperor will be forced to yield by Force, what we beg as a Favour. Heaven has commi&s;erated my Fortune indeed &s;omewhat late; but I al&s;o hope, it will draw on a greater and more &s;peedy Vengeance. Sir, I will take care to inform you of all my other Affairs; however I de&s;ire you alwayes to &s;tand my Friend. I am</P>

<P>LA&s;t Wedne&s;day we took and rai&s;ed <HI>Filleck:</HI> where above a thou&s;and <HI>Janizaries</HI> were &s;lain.
