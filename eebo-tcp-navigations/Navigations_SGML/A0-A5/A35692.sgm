<P>_THat Tract of Land formerly cal|led
<HI>The New Netherlands,</HI> doth

length of which Northward in|to
the Countrey, as it hath not been fully
di&s;covered, &s;o it is not certainly known The bredth
of it is about two hundred miles: The principal
Rivers within this Tract, are <HI>Hud&s;ons</HI> River, <HI>Rari|tan</HI>-River,
and <HI>Delewerhay</HI>-River. The chief I|&s;lands
are the <HI>Manahatans</HI>-I&s;land, <HI>Long</HI>-I&s;land, and

<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
And fir&s;t to begin with the <HI>Manahatans</HI> I&s;land, &s;o
called by the <HI>Indians,</HI> it lieth within land betwixt the
degrees of 41. and 42. of North-latitude, and is a|bout
14 miles long, and two broad. It is bounded
with <HI>Long</HI>-I&s;land on the South, with <HI>Staten</HI>-I&s;land on
the We&s;t, on the North with the Main Land: And with
<HI>Conecticut</HI> Colony on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of it; only a part
of the Main Land belonging to <HI>New-York</HI> Colony,
where &s;everal Towns and Villages are &s;etled, being
about thirty miles in bredth, doth intercept the <HI>Ma|nahatans</HI>

<P><HI>New-York</HI> is &s;etled upon the We&s;t-end of the a|fore&s;aid
I&s;land, having that &s;mall arm of the Sea,
which divides it from <HI>Long</HI>-I&s;land on the South-&s;ide
of it, which runs away Ea&s;tward to <HI>New-England,</HI>
and is Navigable, though dangerous. For about ten
miles from <HI>New-York</HI> is a place called <HI>Hell-Gate,</HI>
which being a narrow pa&s;&s;age, there runneth a vio|lent

&s;upplied with Veni&s;on and Fowl in the Winter, and
Fi&s;h in the Summer by the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they
buy at an ea&s;ie rate; And having the Countrey
round about them, they are continually furni&s;hed
with all &s;uch provi&s;ions as is needful for the life of
man, not only by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> within their

Cramberries, Plums</HI> of &s;everal &s;orts, <HI>Ro&s;berries</HI> and
<HI>Strawberries,</HI> of which la&s;t is &s;uch abundance in
<HI>June,</HI> that the Fields and Woods are died red:
Which the Countrey-people perceiving, in&s;tantly
arm them&s;elves with bottles of Wine, Cream, and
Sugar, and in &s;tead of a Coat of Male, every one
takes a Female upon his Hor&s;e behind him, and &s;o
ru&s;hing violently into the fields, never leave till
they have di&s;rob'd them of their red colours, and
turned them into the old habit.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the I&s;land is very full of
Timber, as Oaks white and red, Walnut-trees, Che&s;|nut-trees,
which yield &s;tore of Ma&s;t for Swine, and
are often therewith &s;ufficiently fatted with Oat-Corn:
as al&s;o Maples, Cedars, Saxifrage, Beach,
Birch, Holly, Hazel, with many &s;orts more.</P>
<P>The Herbs which the Countrey naturally afford,
are Pur&s;lain, white Orage, Egrimony, Violets, Pen|niroyal,
Alicampane, be&s;ides Saxaparilla very com|mon,
with many more Yea, in <HI>May</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee the
Woods and Fields &s;o curiou&s;ly bedecke with Ro&s;es,
and an innumerable multitude of delightful Flow|ers,
not only plea&s;ing the eye, but &s;mell, that you
may behold Nature contending with Art, and &s;tri|ving
to equal, if not excel many Gardens in <HI>Eng|land:</HI>
nay, did we know the vertue of all tho&s;e Plants
and Herbs growing there (which time may more
di&s;cover) many are of opinion, and the Natives do
affirm, that there is no di&s;ea&s;e common to the Coun|trey,
but may be cured without Materials from o|ther
Nations.</P>
<P>There is &s;everal Navigable Rivers and Bays, which
<PB N="5" REF="5">
puts into the North-&s;ide of <HI>Long</HI>-I&s;land, but upon
the South-&s;ide which joyns to the Sea, it is &s;o forti|fied
with bars of &s;ands and &s;holes, that it is a &s;uffi|cient
defence again&s;t any enemy, yet the South-&s;ide
is not without Brooks and Riverets, which empty
them&s;elves into the Sea; yea, you &s;hall &s;carce travel
a mile, but you &s;hall meet with one of them who&s;e
Chri&s;tal &s;treams run &s;o &s;wift, that they purge them|&s;elves
of &s;uch &s;tinking mud and filth, which the &s;tand|ing
or low-paced &s;treams of mo&s;t brooks and rivers
we&s;tward of this Colony leave lying, and are by
the Suns exhalation di&s;&s;ipated, the Air corrupted,
and many Fevers and other di&s;tempers occa&s;ioned,
not incident to this Colony: Neither do the Brooks
and Riverets premi&s;ed, give way to the Fro&s;t in
Winter, or draught in Summer, but keep their
cour&s;e throughout the year.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rivers are very well furni&s;hed with Fi&s;h,
as Bo&s;&s;e, Sheep&s;heads, Place, Pearch, Trouts, Eels,
Turtles, and divers others.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is plentifully &s;tored with all &s;orts of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cattel. Hor&s;es, Hogs, Sheep, Goats, &amp;c.
no place in the North of <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rica</HI> better, which they
can both rai&s;e and m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">intain, by rea&s;on of the large
and &s;pacious Medow, or Marches wherewith it is
furni&s;hed, the I&s;land likewi&s;e producing excellent
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gra&s;s, the &s;eed of which was brought out of
<HI>England,</HI> which they &s;ometime mow twice a
year.</P>
<P>For wilde Bea&s;ts there is Deer, Bear, Wolves,
Foxes, Racoons, Otters, Mu&s;qua&s;hes and Skunks.
Wild Fowl there is great &s;tore of, as Turkies, Heath-Hens,
Quailes, Partridges, Pidgeons, Cranes, Gee&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of &s;everal &s;orts, Brants, Ducks, Widgeon, Teal, and
divers others: There is al&s;o the red Bird, with di|vers
&s;orts of &s;inging birds, who&s;e chirping notes &s;a|lute
the ears of Travellers with an harmonious di&s;|cord,
and in every pond and brook green &s;ilken
Frogs, who warbling forth their untun'd tunes
&s;trive to bear a part in this mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of <HI>Long</HI>-I&s;land lyeth a plain
&s;ixteen miles long and four broad, upon which
plain grows very fine gra&s;s, that makes exceeding
good Hay, and is very good pa&s;ture for &s;heep or o|ther
Cattel; where you &s;hall find neither &s;tick nor
&s;tone to hinder the Hor&s;e heels, or endanger them
in their Races, and once a year the be&s;t Hor&s;es in the
I&s;land are brought hither to try their &s;wiftne&s;s, and
the &s;wift<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t rewarded with a &s;ilver Cup, two being
Annually procured for that purpo&s;e. There are two
or three other &s;mall plains of about a mile &s;quare,
which are no &s;mall benefit to tho&s;e Towns which
enjoy them.</P>
<P>Upon the South-&s;ide of <HI>Long</HI>-I&s;land in the Win|ter,
lie &s;tore of Whales and Crampa&s;&s;es, which the
inhabitants begin with &s;mall boats to make a trade
Catching to their no &s;mall benefit. Al&s;o an innu|merable
multitude of Seals, which make an excel|lent
oyle; they lie all the Winter upon &s;ome broken
Mar&s;hes and Beaches, or bars of &s;and before-menti|oned,
and might be ea&s;ily got were there &s;ome skilful
men would undertake it.</P>
<P>To &s;ay &s;omething of the <HI>Indians,</HI> there is now but
few upon the I&s;land, and tho&s;e few no ways hurtful
but rather &s;erviceable to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and it is to be
admired, how &s;trangely they have deerea&s;t by the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Hand of God, &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t &s;etling of tho&s;e
parts; for &s;ince my time, where there were fix
towns, they are reduced to two &s;mall Villages, and
it hath been generally ob&s;erved, that where the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> come to &s;ettle, a Divine Hand makes way
for them, by removing or cutting off the <HI>Indians,</HI>
either by Wars one with the other, or by &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">me ra|ging
mortal Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>They live principally by Hunting, Fowling, and
Fi&s;hing: their Wives being the Husbandmen to till
the Land, and plant their corn.</P>
<P>The meat they live mo&s;t upon is Fi&s;h, Fowl, and
Veni&s;on; they eat likewi&s;e Polecats, Skunks, Racoon,
Po&s;&s;um, Turtles, and the like.</P>
<P>They build &s;mall moveable Tents, which they re|move
two or three times a year, having their prin|cipal
quarters where they plant their Corn: their
Hunting quarters, and their Fi&s;hing quarters: Their
Recreations are chiefly Foot-ball and Cards, at
which they will play away all they have, excepting a
Flap to cover their nakedne&s;s: They are great lo|vers
of &s;trong drink, yet do not care for drinking,
unle&s;s they have enough to make them&s;elves drunk;
and if there be &s;o many in their Company, that there
is not &s;ufficient to make them all drunk, they u&s;ually
&s;elect &s;o many out of their Company, proportionable
to the quantity of drink, and the re&s;t mu&s;t be Spe|ctators.
And if any one chance to be drunk be|fore
he hath fini&s;ht his proportion, (which is ordi|narily
a quart of Brandy, Rum or Strong-waters)
the re&s;t will pour the re&s;t of his part down his
throat.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
They often, kill one another at the&s;e drunken
Matches, which the friends of the murdered per&s;on,
do revenge upon the Murderer unle&s;s he purcha&s;e
his life with money, which they &s;ometimes do:
Their money is made of a Periwinkle &s;hell of which
there is black and white, made much like unto
beads, and put upon &s;trings.</P>
<P>For their wor&s;hip which is diabolical, it is per|formed
u&s;ually but once or twice a year, unle&s;s up|on
&s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ion, as upon making of
War or the lik<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">; their u&s;ual time is about <HI>Micha|elma&s;s,</HI>
when their corn is fir&s;t ripe, the day being
appointed by their chief prie&s;t or pawaw; mo&s;t of
them go a hunting for veni&s;on: When they are all
congregated, their prie&s;t tells them if he want mo|ney,
there God will accept of no other offering, which
the people beleeving, every one gives money accord|ing
to their ability. The prie&s;t takes the money,
and putting it into &s;ome di&s;hes, &s;ets them upon the
top of their low flat-roofed hou&s;es, and falls to in|vocating
their God to come and receive it, which
with a many loud hallows and outcries, knocking the
ground with &s;ticks, and beating them&s;elves, is per|formed
by the prie&s;t, and &s;econded by the people.</P>
<P>After they have thus a while wearied them&s;elves,
the prie&s;t by his Conjuration brings in a devil a|mong&s;t
them, in the &s;hape &s;ometimes of a fowl, &s;ome|times
of a bea&s;t, and &s;omtimes of a man, at which
the people being amazed, not daring to &s;tir, he im|proves
the opportunity, &s;teps out, and makes &s;ure
of the money, and then returns to lay the &s;pirit,
who in the mean time is &s;ometimes gone, and takes
&s;ome of the Company along with him: but if any
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at &s;uch times do come among&s;t them, it puts
<PB N="9" REF="7">
a period to their proceeding, and they will de&s;ire
their ab&s;ence, telling them their God will not come
whil&s;t they are there.</P>
<P>In their wars they fight no pitcht fields, but
when they have notice of an enemies approach, they
endeavor to &s;ecure their wives and children upon
&s;ome I&s;land, or in &s;ome thick &s;wamp, and then with
their guns and hatchets they way-lay their enemies,
&s;ome lying behind one, &s;ome another, and it is a
great fight where &s;even or eight is &s;lain.</P>
<P>When any <HI>Indian</HI> dies among&s;t them, they bu|ry
him upright, &s;itting upon a &s;eat, with his
Gun, money, and &s;uch goods as he hath with him,
that he may be furni&s;hed in the other world, which
they conceive is We&s;tward, where they &s;hall have
great &s;tore of Game for Hunting and live ea&s;ie
lives. At his Burial his neare&s;t Relations attend
the Hear&s;e with their faces painted black, and do
vi&s;it the grave once or twice a day, where they &s;end
forth &s;ad lamentations &s;o long, till time hath wore
the blackne&s;s off their faces, and afterwards every
year once they view the grave, make a new mourn|ing
for him, trimming up of the Grave, not &s;uf|fering
of a Gra&s;s to grow by it: they fence their
graves with a hedge, and cover the tops with Mats,
to &s;helter them from the rain.</P>
<P>Any <HI>Indian</HI> being dead, his Name dies with him,
no per&s;on daring ever afte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> to mention his Name, it
being not only a breach of their Law, but an abu&s;e
to his friends and relations pre&s;ent, as if it were
done on purpo&s;e to renew their grief: And any o|ther
per&s;on what&s;oever that is named after that
name doth incontinently change his name, and
<PB N="10" REF="8">
takes a new one, their names are not proper &s;et
names as among&s;t Chri&s;tians, but every one invents
a name to him&s;elf, which he likes be&s;t. Some calling
them&s;elves <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tle-&s;nake, Skunk, Bucks-horn,</HI> or the
like: And if a per&s;on die, that his name is &s;ome word
which is u&s;ed in &s;peech, they likewi&s;e change that
word, and invent &s;ome new one, which makes a
great change and alteration in their language.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on is &s;ick, after &s;ome means u&s;ed by
his friends, every one pretending skill in Phy&s;ick;
that proving ineffectual, they &s;end for a Pawaw or
Prie&s;t, who &s;itting down by the &s;ick per&s;on, without
the lea&s;t enquiry after the di&s;temper, waits for a
gift, which he proportions his work accordingly to:
that being received, he fir&s;t begins with a low voice
to call upon his God, calling &s;ometimes upon one,
&s;ometimes on another, rai&s;ing his voice higher and
higher, beating of his naked brea&s;ts and &s;ides, till the
&s;weat runneth down, and his breath is almo&s;t gone,
then that little which is remaining, he evaporates
upon the face of the &s;ick per&s;on three or four times
together, and &s;o takes his leave.</P>
<P>Their Marriages are performed without any Ce|remony,
the Match being fir&s;t made by money. The
&s;um being agreed upon and given to the woman, it
makes a con&s;ummation of their Marriage, if I may
&s;o call it: After that, he keeps her during his plea|&s;ure,
and upon the lea&s;t di&s;like turns her away and
takes another: It is no offence for their married
women to lie with another man, provided &s;he ac|quaint
her husband, or &s;ome of her neare&s;t Relati|ons
with it, but if not, it is accounted &s;uch a fault
that they &s;ometimes puni&s;h it with death: An <HI>In|dian</HI>
may have two wives or more if he plea&s;e; but
tis not &s;o much in u&s;e as it was &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
came among&s;t them: they being ready&punc; in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
<PB N="11" REF="8">
to imitate the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in things both good and
had: any Maid before &s;he is married doth lie with
whom &s;he plea&s;e for money, without any &s;candal, or
the lea&s;t a&s;per&s;ion to be ca&s;t upon her, it being &s;o cu|&s;tomary,
and their laws tolerating of it. They are
