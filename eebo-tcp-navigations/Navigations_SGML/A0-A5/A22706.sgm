<P>_FIRST, It is agreed, &amp; con|cluded, that the Conuentions or Articles contei|ned in this trea|tie &s;hall not be taken or repu|ted any way to derogate from the former Treaties; But that the &s;ayd Treaties &s;hall remaine, and be in their fir&s;t force and vertue, except in
<PB REF="3">tho&s;e points only in which they are by this pre&s;ent Treatie altered.</P>
<P N="2">2 And for the better encrea&s;ing, and confirming of the Amitie and good Intel|ligence betweene the &s;ayd Princes; It is further agreed, that in all the Prouinces, Cities, Ports, and Hauens within either of their Kingdomes and Dominions, com|mandement &s;hall be giuen, That the &s;ub|iects of the one and the other Princes re|&s;pectiuely be kindly and louingly entrea|ted, and be &s;uffered freely and &s;afely to ex|erci&s;e Merchandi&s;e, and to traffique the one with the other without any offence or mole&s;tation; and that they be not hereaf|ter for any cau&s;e or occa&s;ion what&s;oeuer vniu&s;tly vexed contrarie to the Lawes and Cu&s;tomes of the place vnto which they &s;hall re&s;ort, or where they &s;hall abide: and the Magi&s;trates and Officers on either part &s;hall be enioined to &s;ee that all the premi&s;|&s;es be duly ob&s;erued and executed, as eue|rie one of them (where the contrary &s;hall
<PB REF="3">be &s;uffered) will an&s;wer in his owne pro|per name, and as a priuate per&s;on, to the partie grieued, his expen&s;es, damages and intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3 It is likewi&s;e agreed and accorded, That all Cu&s;tomes, Taxes, and Impo&s;iti|ons which now in either Kingdomes are rai&s;ed, to the v&s;e of the Kings, by their Cu&s;tomers, Farmers, and Deputies (as the conditions of affaires at this time requi|reth) &s;halbe continued proui&s;ionally vntill the &s;ame may be either aboli&s;hed or mo|derated; which both the &s;aid Princes will &s;eriou&s;ly endeuour to effect, as their e&s;tates &s;hall permit. And to the end that in the meane time the &s;aid Taxes, Cu&s;tomes, and Impo&s;itions may on both parts bee better knowen, as al&s;o that it may appeare, what is to be paid of right, there &s;hall be Tables made and &s;et vp in publique places, a&s;well at ROAN, and other Cities in FRANCE, as at LONDON, and other Cities of GREAT BRITAINE where need &s;hall
<PB REF="4">be, that thereunto recour&s;e may be had, when que&s;tion or doubt &s;hall ari&s;e of any of the &s;aid Taxes, Cu&s;tomes, and Impo&s;iti|ons in either of the kingdomes.</P>
<P N="4">4 As touching Impo&s;itions &amp; Taxes, which are required in &s;ome Cities to the particular v&s;e and commodity of the &s;aid Cities, vnder pretext of Grants to them made by the Kings and Princes; It is a|greed and accorded, that diligent inquirie &s;hall be had thereof, and that the Maiors and E&s;cheuins or Sheriffes of the Cities of ROAN, CANE, and BVRDEAVX, and of others to whom it may appertaine, &s;hall forthwith deliuer vp vnto the Councell of the French King their &s;aide Letters and Grants, by pretence whereof they rai&s;e and continue &s;uch Taxes and Impo&s;itions, to the end that the &s;ame being &s;eene and viewed, may bee cancelled, and made void, if they haue not beene made orderlie and vpon iu&s;t cau&s;es; and that in the meane &s;ea&s;on the &s;aid Maiors and E&s;cheuins or
<PB REF="4">Sheriffes &s;hall be prohibited, to &s;uffer to be taken either more then is due, or any thing otherwi&s;e than it ought by the &s;aid Grants; neither that they doe any way exceed the conditions conteined and pre|&s;cribed in them, vpon paine of death, and the paiment al&s;o of foure fold for that which &s;hall be &s;o exacted. The like where|of is to be performed in the City of LON|DON, and in other the Cities of GREAT BRITAIN, if it bee found that any &s;uch thing hath beene exacted there.</P>
<P N="5">5 It is al&s;o agreed that the Merchants of FRANCE traffiquing into ENGLAND &s;hall not be con&s;trained heereafter to giue other Caution or Bond than Iuratorie Caution, or an oath for the &s;ale of their Merchandizes, or for the conuerting or employing of the moneys growing there|upon into other wares; neither &s;hall they be driuen for obtaining of further re&s;pite, or for their di&s;charges to other co&s;t or ex|pence in that behalfe.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P N="6">6 Al&s;o it is agreed that the French Shippes may haue free acce&s;&s;e to the Keies of the City of LONDON and other ports and hauens of GREAT BRITAIN, and being there, may lade &amp; vnlade their Mer|chandi&s;e, and let their &s;hips to freight with like liberty, and freedome as the Engli&s;h do in FRANCE, without con&s;traint to vnload their Ships or Ve&s;&s;els into others, or with|out other let or impediment what&s;oeuer: and al&s;o that in all other things like liberty, and equalitie of trade &s;hall be kept, and ob|&s;erued on both parts as much as may be.</P>
<P N="7">7 And becau&s;e it is impo&s;sible to &s;et downe in writing a &s;ufficient proui&s;ion and remedy to euery particular grieuance, or difficulty which may ari&s;e in commerce, and namely in re&s;pect of the qualities of Merchandize, which are to be tran&s;ported to and from the one and other kingdome, as al&s;o in re&s;pect of the abu&s;e which by the malice, negligence or want of skill of Tra|ders &s;ometimes may bee committed; It is
<PB REF="5">agreed that in the City of ROAN there &s;hall be named and appointed by the Chri|&s;tian King two Merchants of good credit and reputation, being skilfull and of good experience, which with two Engli&s;h Mer|chants of good condition and quality to be named by the Amba&s;&s;adour of the Kings Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAIN &amp;c. re&s;i|ding for the time in FRANCE, &s;hall ioint|ly receiue, and heare the complaints and controuer&s;ies of the Merchants of GREAT BRITAIN that may ari&s;e by the Com|merce, and traffique either at ROAN or other Ports and Hauens of that Prouince, and the &s;ame they &s;hall foorthwith accor|ding to equity and right (hauing a re&s;pect to this pre&s;ent Treaty) &s;peedily fini&s;h and compo&s;e: as al&s;o the Kings Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAIN is to name two Eng|li&s;h Merchants of good reputation and ex|perience, which likewi&s;e taking vnto them two French Merchants of like quality to be named by the Amba&s;&s;adour of the French King re&s;iding in ENGLAND for the time
<PB REF="6">&s;hall doe the like, and &s;hall prouide &s;peedy remedy to all the complaints which may happen by rea&s;on of the &s;aid traffique or co~merce. And if the&s;e foure cannot agree, then by mutual a&s;&s;ent between them&s;elues they are to chu&s;e and take vnto them a fift, the &s;ame being in ROAN a French man; in LONDON an Engli&s;hman; and &s;o by the con&s;ent of the greater number of them the iudgement &s;hall pa&s;&s;e. And to the end that this office may with better ef|fect be executed, there &s;hall be giuen vnto them on either part Commi&s;&s;ions with ne|ce&s;&s;arie authoritie to performe the &s;ame: And in ca&s;e any great difficultie do ari&s;e, &s;o as it &s;hall be conuenient or nece&s;&s;arie to certifie either of the Princes thereof, the &s;aid Merchants named and appointed in manner afore&s;aid &s;hall take care to aduer|ti&s;e the Councell of the Princes re&s;pectiue|ly thereof, to the end that they may giue &s;peedie remedie without lo&s;&s;e of time and great charge of expences. The like order &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed and ob&s;erued at BVR|DEAVX
<PB REF="6">and CANE and other places of Mart, and Market, &amp; Cities in FRANCE, and the &s;ame al&s;o &s;hall be ob&s;erued in the Cities of GREAT BRITAIN and IRE|LAND, that &s;o tho&s;e Per&s;ons which &s;hall be named &amp; appointed to vndergoe the&s;e Offices, in the &s;aid places may according to the afore&s;aid forme determine of the com|plaints and difficulties which may happen by rea&s;on of Commerce and traffique be|tweene them.</P>
<P N="8">8 And for the better accommodating of the &s;aid Merchants trading in the king|doms and Dominions of either of the &s;aid Princes, and for ea&s;ing the labours and charges of them which are appointed to this Office, &s;o farre foorth as may be, it is agreed that the &s;aid Merchants as well En|gli&s;h as French vnto whom this authoritie &s;hall be committed, which hereafter &s;hall be called Con&s;eruators of Commerce and traffique, &s;hall be named and appointed from yeare to yeare, and &s;hall take oathe
<PB REF="7">in FRANCE before the Prior and Con&s;uls as well in the Citie of ROAN as in the o|ther Cities in which &s;uch Con&s;eruators ought to bee appointed, and likewi&s;e in LONDON, and in other Cities of GREAT BRITAINE and IRELAND where need &s;hall be, that is to &s;ay, that they &s;hall well and faithfully performe this Office and au|thoritie committed vnto them, and that during the time afore&s;aid &s;o often as occa|&s;ion &s;hall require they &s;hall diligently in|tend this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, &amp; that they &s;hall therin affoord their labour freely, requiring no|thing of the &s;ubiects for that cau&s;e, except where the partie &s;hall de&s;ire a copie of the Acts in writing, in which ca&s;e the taxation of the &s;aid writings &s;hall bee made by the &s;aid Con&s;eruators moderately and accor|ding to rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="9">9 Moreouer it is agreed that all exce&s;|&s;iue fees, wages, charges and &s;maller du|ties and paiments, which Officers and Mi|ni&s;ters of diuers places do now exact of the
<PB REF="7">&s;aid Merchants, namely Searchers &amp; Wai|ters, Laders &amp; Vnladers, Packers, Porters, and generally all other &s;uch kind of Offi|cers, and publique Mini&s;ters &s;hall be orde|red and moderated by the &s;aid Con&s;erua|tors, and a rea&s;onable rate of their duties &s;hall be &s;et down which &s;hall be pre&s;ented to the Kings Councel in either of the king|doms, and the &s;ame by them being &s;eene and confirmed, &s;hall afterward be publi&s;h|ed and &s;et vp in writing &s;euerally in Towns and places accu&s;tomed, to the end that the Merchants on either part may be certaine and a&s;&s;ured of that which ought by them in &s;uch ca&s;e to be paied.</P>
<P N="10">10 Al&s;o the &s;aid Con&s;eruators &s;hall informe them&s;elues particularly of the li|berties, and priuiledges which are preten|ded, and challenged by &s;ome Cities to be due vnto them and their Inhabitants in the Kingdoms and Dominions of either of the Princes, and they &s;hall likewi&s;e informe them of the commoditie and incommo|ditie
<PB REF="8">thereof, which being done they are to aduerti&s;e their Princes on both parts, that by the aduice of their Councell the &s;ame may be moderated according to equitie, and reduced to the ancient v&s;es of the &s;aid places and Cities.</P>
<P N="11">11 The &s;aid Con&s;eruators &s;hall al&s;o haue charge to looke vnto the waights and mea&s;ures which are in the towns of either of the kingdoms, to the end that there be no fraud, or abu&s;e &s;uffered therein by neg|ligence or deceipt of inferiour Mini&s;ters, and as for the Merchandi&s;es brought out of either of the &s;aid Princes Kingdomes, or from other places, they &s;hall determine and order, which of them are &s;ubiect to vi|&s;itation, and are to be accounted as law|full or vnlawfull, and which not.</P>
<P N="12">12 And fora&s;much as the principall complaint made by the Amba&s;&s;ador of his Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAINE &amp;c. and by the Merchants of ENGLAND is
<PB REF="8">again&s;t an Arre&s;t or Iudgement giuen in the Councell of the French King, bearing date the one and twentieth of Aprill, in the yeare of our Lord, one thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred, containing an Order touching the Workeman&s;hip and qualitie of Woollen clothes to be brought into FRANCE by the Engli&s;h Merchants, e&s;pecially into the Prouinces of NORMANDIE, the le&s;&s;er BRITAINE, and GVVYEN; the &s;aid French King being de&s;irous to giue contentment vnto his good brother the King of GREAT BRITAINE, at the in|&s;tance and motion made for the &s;ame di|uers times by his Amba&s;&s;ador, and being willing al&s;o to further the co~merce of Dra|perie or Woollen Clothes, (&s;o as no detri|ment may thereby redound vnto the pub|like) is plea&s;ed that the &s;aid Arre&s;t and Iudgement be reuoked, and doth him&s;elfe reuoke and abrogate the &s;ame, and from hencefoorth di&s;chargeth the Merchants of ENGLAND from the confi&s;cation or for|feiture, impo&s;ed as well in the &s;ame Arre&s;t,
<PB REF="9">as in all other Arre&s;ts and Ordinances made for, and concerning the &s;aid Drape|rie or Woollen Clothes, and doth permit and grant vnto the &s;aid Merchants of ENGLAND, that if any Woollen Clo|thes heereafter being faultie, and ill made, be brought by them or any of them, to be vented in FRANCE, that they may not|with&s;tanding carrie the &s;ame backe againe out of FRANCE. And fora&s;much as the &s;ayd Engli&s;h Merchants, vpon the diffe|rence, which may grow for the qualitie and good or ill condition of their Clothes, be much troubled and hindered through lo&s;&s;e of time, and the &s;taying of their Clo|thes to their damages; It is agreed, and ac|corded, that the &s;aid Con&s;eruators of commerce deputed in maner afore&s;aid, if at any time &s;uch complaint be brought vn|to them, &s;hall vpon due con&s;ideration of the making, and of their value, and of the price of the Clothes iudge and determine which of them are to be accounted lawfull and &s;aleable, and which are to be reiected
<PB REF="9">and &s;ent backe, as faulte and ill made: in which ca&s;e, the &s;aid French King doth commit the whole con&s;ideration, and de|termination thereof, to the hone&s;tie, and con&s;cience of the Con&s;eruators, and will ratifie and allow what they &s;hall do there|in, and touching tho&s;e Clothes which &s;hall be adiudged to be &s;ent backe as faul|tie, nothing &s;hall be heereafter required by his Officers for tran&s;porting of them forth of the kingdome.</P>
<P N="13">13 It is further accorded, and conclu|ded, That the libertie and freedome of commerce in tran&s;porting of what&s;oeuer Merchandizes, whether they be Manu|factures or Wares vnwrought, &s;hall accor|ding to this Treatie and other precedent Treaties be mainteined in both the King|domes, and that no re&s;traint or prohibiti|ons &s;hal be made on either &s;ide to the con|trarie: and if any haue beene made of late, the &s;ame &s;hall be reuoked, except notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e Merchandizes which haue
<PB REF="10">beene in former times prohibited to be brought and tran&s;ported foorth by &s;peci|all Lawes and Statutes in either of the Kingdomes: All which kinde of Merchan|dizes, that they may be certainly knowne, are to be comprehended in writing, and deliuered to the &s;aid Con&s;eruators of com|merce on either &s;ide, and publiquely &s;et vp in maner afore&s;aid.</P>
<P N="14">14 Moreouer it is agreed, That if there doe happen any Ship to go from GREAT BRITAINE into FRANCE, or from FRANCE into GREAT BRITAINE, laden with greater quantitie of Merchan|dize, than for which the Cu&s;tome and o|ther duties hath beene iu&s;tly payd; in that ca&s;e the &s;aid quantitie onely &s;hall be &s;ub|iect to confi&s;cation, and the re&s;idue of the &s;aid Merchandizes &s;hall be freely di&s;char|ged: Notwith&s;tanding if among&s;t the &s;aid Merchandizes there be found any Wares which by the Statutes and Ordinances of the Kingdome from whence they are to be
<PB REF="10">tran&s;ported, may not lawfully be carried; in that ca&s;e, the Ordinances and Statutes of the &s;aid Kingdome are to be ob&s;erued.</P>
<P N="15">15 Likewi&s;e it is agreed and accorded, That the Merchants and Inhabitants of the Ilands of GERNESEY and IERSEY, may freely and &s;afely trade and traffique in the Kingdome of FRANCE, and in the parts thereof, and that they &s;hall haue and enioy the like priuiledges and liberties there, as the Subiects of the French King doe enioy in the &s;aid Ilands, paying not|with&s;tanding all duties in euery place ap|pertaining vnto the Princes.</P>
<P N="16">16 The Subiects of his Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAINE, &s;hall receiue in all their cau&s;es and &s;utes, ready and expe|dite iu&s;tice in FRANCE, and the Officers and Mini&s;ters of the Ports of NORMAN|DIE, the le&s;&s;er BRITAINE and GVY|EN, &s;hall be charged kindly and friendly to entertaine them. And if any matter of
<PB REF="11">greater moment and importance do ari&s;e, the French King inioineth his Councell to take vpon them the knowledge thereof them&s;elues, or to delegate or appoint Iudges indifferent, and not &s;u&s;pected; As al&s;o the like order &s;hall be taken by his Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAINE to|wards the Subiects of the French King, a|biding within his Kingdome, and requi|ring iu&s;tice there.</P>
<P N="17">17 The Subiects of the French King entring into the Ports of the Kingdome of GREAT BRITAINE, &s;hall not heere|eafter pay any thing more for Cockets, then the naturall Subiects of the &s;aid King|dome are accu&s;tomed to pay.</P>
<P N="18">18 And if it &s;hall happen that any of the Subiects of either of the &s;aid Kings, by &s;torme or tempe&s;t, or for feare of the ene|mie, &s;hall be compelled to ca&s;t anckor in any Port, Road or Hauen, appertaining to the &s;aid Kings re&s;pectiuely, they &s;hall not
<PB REF="11">be vrged to pay any Cu&s;tome, or other du|ties, either at their entrance or departure, for their Merchandizes, &s;o ca&s;ually brought in. Prouided alwaies, that the Ma&s;ter of the Shippes, or the Factor of the Merchants, doe the &s;ame day wherein any &s;uch Ve&s;&s;ell &s;hall &s;o arriue, or the next day after the arriuall, certifie the Officers or Cu&s;tomers of the place, to whom it appertaineth, the true occa&s;ion of the &s;aid arriuall, and al&s;o that they (being required) &s;hall exhibite their Charter parties, &amp; be enioined to put foorth, and depart from thence &s;o &s;oone as the winde may &s;erue them, or the perill be remooued: And if it happen while&s;t they &s;o remaine in the Port, that vpon ne|ce&s;sitie they bee compelled to &s;ell their Merchandizes, or any part thereof; then they &s;hall pay to the Cu&s;tomer or Farmers, &s;uch duties as are to be an&s;wered for, to the quantitie onely of that which they haue &s;olde; and it &s;hall be lawfull vnto them freely to tran&s;port the re&s;t.</P>

<P N="19">19 And the French King being de&s;i|rous to make it more appeare how greatly he e&s;teemeth of the amitie of his good Brother, the Kings Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAINE, and his willingne&s;&s;e, lo|uingly and fauourablie to entreat his &s;aid Brothers Subiects, abiding and trading in FRANCE, and how much hee fauoureth this mutuall entercour&s;e and Commerce betweene their Subiects, although the right of <HI>Aubeyne</HI> is woorthilie accoun|ted among&s;t the mo&s;t ancient priuiled|ges and prerogatiues of the Kingdome; neuerthele&s;&s;e, he is plea&s;ed to permit and grant to the Engli&s;h Merchants and their Procurators or Factors, and to all other the Subiects of the Kings Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAINE, full libertie and right to make their la&s;t Willes and Te&s;taments, accordingly; and according to their good liking, to di&s;po&s;e as well liuing as dying, of their Merchandize, Monies, Debts and of all other their mooueable goods, which either they haue or ought to haue, in any

<P N="20">20 Likewi&s;e it is agreed, and accorded, That the Subiects of the French King may in the &s;ame maner freely make their Te&s;ta|ments, and according to their plea&s;ure may either at their death, or while they liue, di&s;po&s;e of their goods in ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND, and in other the Lands and Dominions of the Kings Maie&s;tie of GREAT BRITAINE; And that after their deathes, whether they &s;hall die Te&s;tate or Inte&s;tate, their Heires either named in the Te&s;tament or other|wi&s;e &s;ucceeding by Law, &s;hall according to the Lawes of FRANCE haue and en|ioy the &s;ame goods.
