<P>THE Dedication of this following Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks,</HI> may mo&s;t ju&s;tly be Addre&s;&s;ed to the Clemency and Patronage of Your Maje&s;ty for Two Rea&s;ons. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the greate&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e was Written at <HI>Ham|burg,</HI> whil&s;t I was actually employed for the &s;pace al|mo&s;t of Eleven Years in the Service of Your Maje&s;ty, the which, I hope will not be looked upon as a Point of my Demerit, or Neglect in my Duty, to have taken out &s;o many Hours as this Work might Require from the Service of Your Maje&s;ty. For I can &s;afely &s;ay, and that Your Maje&s;ty's Secretaries al&s;o in <HI>England,</HI> and Abroad, can Atte&s;t for me, that I have been diligent in my Office, and have neglected nothing therein, which my Duty and Services to Your Maje&s;ty might require, and expect from me; for it was Written at my Vacant Hours, when nothing of my other Services could give me the lea&s;t Avocation.</P>
<P>But what may chiefly oblige me farther to this De|dication, is the Healing, Powerful, and Succe&s;sful Hand which Your Maje&s;ty hath Applied by Your Amba&s;&s;a|dors, in making that Peace at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> between the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> which will ever be remembred in Future Ages, and which (as Your former Actions &s;hewed the World You were a great Captain in the Arts of

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Would not have Thee entertain a wor&s;e Opinion of this <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> by Rea&s;on of the Place where it was Wrote and Fini&s;hed, being at a far di&s;tance both from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Vienna:</HI> Though perhaps it might have been more lively, had its Colours been laid on in the Places them&s;elves, where the Actions were performed; and at a time when the Humour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Idea</HI> I conceived of their Actings, had taken &s;o &s;trong an Impre&s;&s;ion in my Mind, that whil&s;t I was upon the Place, I could &s;uffer nothing to pa&s;s my Pen, without its due Ob&s;ervation. Being thus accu&s;tomed to &s;uch Contem|plations as the&s;e, in my more Youthful Days, I could not let pa&s;s the continual News, and the con&s;tant Intelligences I received from <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> and other Parts which were the Seats of War between the <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> without making &s;ome Reflections thereupon.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>After which, I might ju&s;tly challenge the Privilege of an Exaucto|rate, or of a Miles <HI>Emeritus:</HI> And I think I need not Blot any more Paper for the future on any Subject relating to the <HI>Turks;</HI> for having arrived, at that great Period of the la&s;t Wars, concluded between the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> and all his Allies again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> It may appear how much the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force is able to avail, when it is put into the Scale and Ballance again&s;t all <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been an ancient Cu&s;tom, and Policy among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the time of their pro&s;perous Succe&s;&s;es by which their Empire was enlarged, never to continue a War longer than for three Years, in which time they always advanced con&s;iderably, and would make no Peace with their Neighbours, until their Triumphs and Acqui&s;itions would an&s;wer the expences, and effu&s;ions of their Blood, and Trea|&s;ures: After which they commonly fixed Twenty Years for the Settle|ment, and Security of tho&s;e new Conque&s;ts and Plantations; in which time many young Soldiers being Born and Bred up in Arms, they not only took tho&s;e Habitations for their Native Soil, but e&s;teemed them al&s;o to be by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion obliged ever to defend and maintain them. But the&s;e la&s;t Wars, have quite put the <HI>Turks</HI> out of their Ancient Methods; for in&s;tead of maintaining a War no longer than Three Years, they have been forced to continue it for more than Twenty, to the great Ruin and De&s;truction of their Empire. I have always been of Opinion, That the <HI>Turks</HI> could never main|tain a VVar for longer than Three Years, I mean with benefit, and profit to the advancement of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, of which I once made very per&s;picuous Ob&s;ervations. Whil&s;t I was in the Camp with them, I found the Timariots very poor, and wanting at the end of that Term, &s;o that they &s;toal from each other their Bridles and Saddles, Lances, and all other nece&s;&s;aries of War, and would excu&s;e them&s;elves by &s;aying, that they could not do otherwi&s;e in &s;o long a War of more than their Three Years: And in like manner the <HI>Jani|&s;aries</HI> by their ancient Con&s;titution might challenge a Privilege to quit the Service at the end of the Month of <HI>October,</HI> and in ca&s;e they were not called, they might then Disband them&s;elves, on St. <HI>Demetriu's</HI> Day, which is the <HI>28th</HI> Day of <HI>October,</HI> at which time the <HI>Jani&s;ar Aga,</HI> could not without danger of his own Life in &s;ome mutiny deny them di&s;mi&s;&s;ion for that Year's Campaign: VVhich the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> e&s;teemed always a Privilege due to their Order, but the <HI>A&s;iatick Timariots</HI> called <HI>Timar Spahcelar</HI> were always &s;ooner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, in con&s;ideration of the long Journies they were to make to their VVinter-Quarters, &s;ome of them being as far di&s;tant, as <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> as <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> or <HI>Scham,</HI> as <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Iconium,</HI> and other Parts, which to Travel back|wards and forwards would take up commonly four or five Months
<PB REF="5"> time: After which to pa&s;s a Summers Campaign, was very Laborious for the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Forces to undergo, (who commonly are e&s;teemed a &s;oft People) which yet they were obliged to do on Forfeiture of all their Hereditary E&s;tates; in which the <HI>Turks</HI> by their ancient Con|&s;titutions were &s;o Rigorous, that they would admit of no excu&s;es for their ab&s;ence, even of Death it &s;elf; for in ca&s;e the Father died lea|leaving an Infant Son of a Year old, even then he was obliged to the VVar, though he was carried in the Arms of his Nur&s;e. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> con&s;equently, being always in Action, and obliged to a perpetual Duty again&s;t the Enemy, were never excu&s;ed from a &s;trict vigilance over all the Motions of their Neighbours, whom in the times of Peace we might properly call Enemies; for they Fought very often, and yet without VVar &s;o called; for in ca&s;e they met, and engaged in the Field with a le&s;s number than Five thou&s;and Men on a &s;ide, and without Cannon, it was not called VVar, but a Martial Exerci&s;e in the times of Peace; and that is the rea&s;on, why we find &s;o many Palancas rai&s;ed over all <HI>Hungary</HI> on one &s;ide, and the other, which are de&s;igned to give a &s;top to any &s;ud|dain Irruption of an Enemy, within which Palancas (&s;o called) the Poor Inhabitants on either &s;ide, Shelter their VVives and Children, their Hor&s;es and Cattle, with all their Faculties and Sub&s;tance, it being not lawful for the Enemies on either &s;ide to po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, on their High-ways and Roads to a Market, every thing was to be &s;ecured, and neither &s;ide could touch the &s;ame without Ju&s;tice performed upon due Complaints made to the Pa&s;ha, or Chri|&s;tian Governour of the Province. This was the Ancient Con&s;titu|tion whil&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> prevailed in <HI>Hungary:</HI> But &s;ince the la&s;t VVar and Peace concluded, things no doubt have been &s;et upon ano|ther Foot, and other Provi&s;ions have been made to &s;ecure the Chri|&s;tian Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t; for before this time the <HI>Turks</HI> were be|come the mo&s;t In&s;olent People in the VVorld, and would never do Ju&s;tice to a Chri&s;tian; for unle&s;s it were con&s;i&s;tent with their own Intere&s;t and De&s;ign, they would &s;hew them&s;elves Proud, Haughty and Supercilious, expecting Gifts, and returning none, expecting for a Flower a piece of Gold, or &s;ome piece of Cloth of the fine&s;t Dye and Spinning we have in <HI>England;</HI> and to this Pa&s;s were the <HI>Turks</HI> come, that they called the Pre&s;ents made to them by the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to be their Tribute, and the Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent to them, they acknowledged for no other, than for <HI>Mahapous</HI> (as they called them) which &s;ignified Ho&s;tages given for Peace, and the Security of the Good-behaviour of their Ma&s;ters towards the Port: Their Pride was al&s;o &s;o extraordinary, that they would never vouch&s;afe, to require any Counterpart from the King, or Prince with whom they Trea|ted, or Copies, unle&s;s &s;uch as were con&s;erved among&s;t their <HI>Archives,</HI> or Office of the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> or Chief Secretary; inferring that the Power of the Grand Seignior was able to make good, what&s;oever
<PB REF="6"> he &s;hould require on the Score of the Royal Signature; which no Sovereign Prince will now receive from a Proud and In&s;olent <HI>Turk:</HI> For prai&s;ed be that God of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who hath brought down that Imperious Spirit of the <HI>Turks</HI> to &s;uch a Degree, That they can now own their Weakne&s;s and be a&s;hamed of their former Follies, which render'd them in&s;upportable in their Conver&s;ation with <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE TURKS From the Year 1678, to the Year 1699.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno</HI> 1679.</NOTE>WE have in our preceding Hi&s;tory repre&s;ented the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire for &s;eve|ral years pa&s;t, under ma|ny Circum&s;tances of Hap|pine&s;s and Glory. The <HI>Turks</HI> had been &s;ucce&s;sful in their Wars abroad, having in|crea&s;ed and enlarged their Empire by ad|ding <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> thereunto, with the Countrey belonging to it. They had gained and conquered all the I&s;land of <HI>Can|dia,</HI> with that invincible Fortre&s;s, and there|upon had put an end to a War with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> which had continued for the &s;pace of Twenty &s;ix Years. After which they carried their Conquering Arms into <HI>Poland,</HI> where they took the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Caminiec,</HI> which is the Key of that King|dom; and thence marched into that Coun|trey as far as <HI>Leopolis,</HI> which they brought under the Tribute of Eighty thou&s;and Crowns a-year, and &s;o returned back again into their own Dominions without any Op|po&s;ition, or &s;o much almo&s;t as the Appear|ance of an Enemy: And to render this Action the more ob&s;ervable, it was attend|ed with the lea&s;t Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure, of any Enterprize of &s;o bold and daring a De&s;ign; and proved an Expedition &s;o profitable and beneficial, that &s;carce a <HI>Ja|nizary</HI> or Hor&s;eman returned without Spoil, or Plunder, or Slaves of both Sexes. All which Wars were acted within the &s;pace of Thirteen Years, during the Government of <HI>Achmet Kuperli,</HI> with &s;uch Intervals al|&s;o of Peace, that War &s;eemed but an En|tertainment to exerci&s;e the Soldiery, and amu&s;e their Minds, le&s;t they &s;hould fall into Mutiny and Sedition; all the Parti|culars of which we have already at large related. And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, and &s;ay, That Ju&s;tice is the proper means to render a People flouri&s;hing and happy; an In&s;tance whereof we have through all the Government of <HI>Kuperli,</HI> who being a Per&s;on educated and skilful in the Law, admini&s;tred Ju&s;tice equally to the People; his Eyes were not blinded with Avarice, which might bia&s;s or thwart him in giving Judgment; he was not cruel, or bloody, or inclined to take away Mens Lives for the &s;ake of their Riches; nor more ambitious than what &s;erved to make him jealous of his Honour, and zealous to con&s;erve and keep up his Fame and Reputation in the World; which is nece&s;&s;ary for Mini&s;ters in his &s;ublime Station. Wherefore let us look on tho&s;e Times which were as quiet, calm and peaceable as any that ever had &s;miled on the <HI>Ottoman</HI> State, and ju&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">r bute tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings to the Favour of Heaven, which was plea&s;ed in tho&s;e Days to behold &s;o much Ju&s;tice and Equity di&s;pen&s;ed to a People unaccu&s;tomed there|unto, and perhaps in Reward thereof, to make the Government more ea&s;ie and plea|&s;ant, than either before or &s;ince tho&s;e Hal|cyon Days. But now that <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha</HI> comes to &s;ucceed in the Place of &s;o ju&s;t and equal a Governour, a Per&s;on of Vio|lence, Rapine, Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Fal&s;e, Perfidious, Bloody, and without Rea&s;on or Ju&s;tice; we have nothing to repre&s;ent at the beginning of his Government, be&s;ides his Oppre&s;&s;ion, Extortion, Cruelties and Acts of Inju&s;tice beyond any thing that was ever practi&s;ed before in the Reign of the mo&s;t Tyrannical Princes: and in Pro|ce&s;s of time becoming va&s;tly Rich with the Spoils and Ruine of many thou|&s;ands of Families, he accompli&s;hes the full Mea&s;ure of his Iniquity by the per&s;idious Breach of the Truce between the Emperor and his Ma&s;ter the Sultan: For tho' it wanted only three Years of being expired, yet tru&s;ting to the Power and Force of his
<PB N="2" REF="8"> ill-gotten Wealth, he had not Patience to expect &s;o long a Term, being pu&s;hed for|ward by his own De&s;tiny, and incited thereunto by covetous and ambitious De|&s;ires, joyned to a Scorn, and a mean Opi|nion of the Chri&s;tians, to whom he would &s;carce allow either Under&s;tanding, or Cou|rage, or Conduct in War: In which vain Confidence and Pre&s;umption of his invin|cible Power, he precipitated the whole <HI>Ot|toman</HI> Empire into a di&s;mal and direful Con|dition and State, from whence proceeded nothing but Slaughter, and Tragedies, fa|tal both to his own &s;elf, and to his Ma|&s;ter, as will appear in the Progre&s;s of this Hi&s;tory. But before we enter on tho&s;e greater Matters, let us fir&s;t con&s;ider this Grand Vizier in his Behaviour towards the <HI>Turks,</HI> and others who were Subjects to the Sultan. It is certain, that he had his fir&s;t Ri&s;e from <HI>Kuperli</HI> the Father, and married his Daughter, and was after|wards on the &s;core of that Alliance, fa|voured by the Son: he was made Capitan Pa&s;ha, or Admiral of the Fleet; but being as it were out of his Element, and not plea&s;ed with the Sea, he was con&s;tituted Chimacam, and placed with the Grand Seignior, and at all times next his Per&s;on when the Vizier was ab&s;ent, and employ|ed in the Wars: In which Capacity and Condition (as we have before related) he behaved him&s;elf with that gentle and a&s;&s;a|ble Behaviour towards all Per&s;ons, as gave Hopes and Expectations of better and more temperate Government when he &s;hould come to be Vizier. But being rai&s;ed to that &s;ublime Station, he &s;oon changed his Hu|mour, and began to &s;hew the Fiercene&s;s of his Nature, which he had long &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed. In Evidence of which, we have &s;o ma|ny In&s;tances and Examples of his Cruelty and Inju&s;tice to produce, that had we no other matter than his Management of Af|fairs in the time of Peace, without Re|gard or Reference to Foreign Wars, his Proceedings were &s;o irregular and unrea|&s;onable, as might for the Extravagancy of them, de&s;erve to be kept in Memory: But they are too many to be recounted, and therefore we &s;hall content our &s;elves with &s;ome few which have relation to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation, and to the Subjects of other Princes in Peace and Alliance with the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Samuel Pentlow,</HI> who lived about Thirty Years a Merchant at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> will never be forgotten by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory of that Place: The mat|ter is &s;o extraordinary as might de&s;erve to be related at large, with all the Circum|&s;tances of it; but I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to a &s;hort and brief Narrative, which was this.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pentlow</HI> had by a long Trade, in tract of time, gained very con&s;iderable Riches, be&s;ides an E&s;tate in Land left hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> by his Father in <HI>England;</HI> to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"> which, being de&s;irous to have Heirs his own Body, he married a <HI>Greek</HI> Woman of mean Extraction. The Grand Vizier having received intimation thereof, and of the Riches of <HI>Pentlow,</HI> which were magni|fied to him, according to the Account made on Rich Men, who&s;e Fortune it is to have their E&s;tates always over-valued; he immediately &s;wallowed in his Thoughts all his Wealth and E&s;tate, as if he had been a Pa&s;ha, or &s;ome other Subject who had grown fat and wealthy to a degree worthy the Grand Seignior's Notice and Acceptance. And to bring him within the compa&s;s of &s;uch a Seizure, he declared, That who&s;oever had married a Woman, who was a Subject to the Grand Seignior, did by Virtue of &s;uch a Match become, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> a Subject, and yield him&s;elf to the &s;ame Condition with his Wife; which being a Law never before made or declared, was levelled only at <HI>Pentlow</HI> to hook in his E&s;tate; having never before been pra|cti&s;ed, and perhaps will never be again, unle&s;s the &s;ame Circum&s;tances concurr of &s;uch a Vizier, and &s;uch a Per&s;on as this our Merchant was.</P>
<P><HI>Pentlow</HI> had notice of this new Law which the Vizier had promulged, and was not un&s;en&s;ible that it was levelled at his E&s;tate: But yet I know not what Star guided him, or what Charm affixed, or wedded him to the Countrey, he provi|ded not again&s;t the Snare laid for him, which he might ea&s;ily have avoided by exporting his E&s;tate, as Merchants com|monly do, into other Countries; but in|&s;tead thereof, he keeps all about him, and finding him&s;elf &s;ickly and decaying, he made his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament in a formal manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Ga|briel Smith <HI>and Mr.</HI> John A&s;h|ley.</NOTE> and con&s;tituted two Merchants to be his Executors, without Reflection or Thoughts how the Vizier had decreed the Grand Seignior to be his Heir, which accordingly &s;ucceeded in a &s;hort time afterwards: For <HI>Pentlow</HI> being dead, the News was &s;peedily carried to the Chief Cu&s;tomer at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> who had laid the Plot to &s;eize his E&s;tate; and by him the Grand Vizier was informed of the great Wealth fallen to the Sultan by the Death of his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject. The covetous De&s;ire of &s;o va&s;t Riches, which was magnified five times beyond its real Value, cau&s;ed the Vizier with all Expedi|tion to di&s;patch a <HI>Capugi-Ba&s;ha</HI> to <HI>Smyrna</HI> to take all the E&s;tate of the Decea&s;ed into his Hands, for the U&s;e of the Grand Seig|nior; and in ca&s;e the Executors refu&s;ed to
<PB N="3" REF="8"> make a free and clear Re&s;ignation accord|ingly, then to bring them up Pri&s;oners to <HI>Adrianople.</HI> The Executors not complying as the Officers required, were carried up by him to <HI>Adrianople:</HI> Where to extort from them a confe&s;&s;ion of the whole E&s;tate, they were threatned with the Gallies, with the Rack, the Wheel and other Tortures. In fine, after an Impri&s;onment of &s;ome Days, with a Collar of Iron about their Necks, to which a Chain was fixed and rivetted to a Po&s;t with Manacles on their Hands; and after a thou&s;and menaces of farther Puni&s;h|ment, they were forced &s;o far to comply, as to Promi&s;e, and give Obligation to pay un|to the Vizier, or his Order, the Sum of Ninety thou&s;and Dollars within a certain time after their Arrival at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> To rai&s;e this Money again&s;t the Term prefixed, &s;uch ha&s;t was made, that the Goods of the Decea&s;ed were Sold at &s;uch low Rates, that they amounted not within Five or Six thou|&s;and Dollars of the Sum, for which the Executors had Engaged; which they refu|&s;ing to pay out of their own E&s;tates; were again Impri&s;oned at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where they lay for the &s;pace of five or &s;ix Months, until &s;uch time as a Compo&s;ition was made, and Expedients found for their Enlargment. Many other pa&s;&s;ages occurred of the like in|ju&s;tice, thro' the whole cour&s;e of this matter, which for brevity &s;ake we purpo&s;ely omit: In regard that what we have &s;aid already, is &s;ufficient to give the Reader an in&s;tance of this Vizier's avarice and inju&s;tice: Of which the Turks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He was af|terwards Grand Vi|zier, and cut off with the Grand Seignior.</NOTE> as well as the Chri&s;tians were &s;o &s;en&s;ible; that <HI>Solyman,</HI> the late Vizier's <HI>Kiaja,</HI> or Steward, and then <HI>Imbrahor</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the Grand Seignior, demanding one day concerning the Avania of <HI>Pentlow,</HI> could not &s;uppre&s;s his Thoughts (tho' much a Courtier) but &s;aid, <HI>In this Man's time the Mu&s;&s;elmin or Believers, can|not expect better U&s;age or Treatment than the Gaurs or Chri&s;tians.</HI> But this &s;ingle in|&s;tance is not &s;ufficient to expre&s;s the un|ju&s;t, and rapacious Humour of this Vizier; who in an unparallell'd manner of proceeding did ever incline to the Plaintiff; in who&s;e favour having given Sentence again&s;t the Defendant to the utmo&s;t A&s;per demanded, his method was to cau&s;e the Money im|mediately to be paid; and took it to him|&s;elf, giving the Plaintiff &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare thereof, not worthy the Trouble or Ex|pence of the Suit: In this manner he dealt with another Merchant of our Nation, on whom one <HI>Pizzamano</HI> an Italian made a fal&s;e pretence of Six thou&s;ands Dollars, which Cau&s;e being brought before the Vi|zier, he readily condemned our Engli&s;h Merchant; and having forced the payment by a rigorous Impri&s;onment, he appro|priated the whole Sum to his own U&s;e; giving the Plaintiff about Thirty Dollars, as a gratuitous Reward for turning Turk; he having in compliance with the Vizier, and to gain his favour, renounced his Faith, and Sold his Religion at &s;o vile a Price. In a &s;hort time after which the Vizier extorted from our Turky Company Fifty thou&s;and Dollars, and demanded an increa&s;e of the u&s;ual Pre&s;ents which at certain times were made to him, and to all the Officers of the Court: The which, and the like man|ner of Proceedings, tho' they gained him the hatred of all Men, yet the con&s;tancy of the Grand Seignior to his Mini&s;ters, and his me|thod in making his Ma&s;ter &s;harer with him in all his Rapines, &s;eemed to &s;ecure him from all apprehen&s;ion of Danger: For when the Grand Seignior upon Complaints made to him, told him of the ill Reports he had received; The Vizier an&s;wered, <HI>That his Ma|je&s;ty might be plea&s;ed to weigh the Benefits he had received by his Admini&s;tration of Affairs, which would appear by the Increa&s;e of his Trea&s;ury; and that if he de&s;ired to have his Empire well Governed, he mu&s;t &s;uffer him to u&s;e the means proper for that end; other|wi&s;e his Head was at his Command, which he might take off, and &s;upply the Office with a better Mini&s;ter.</HI></P>

It is true, their City being advan|tageou&s;ly Situated in the Gulf of <HI>Venice,</HI> did for a long time during that War reap a con&s;iderable benefit by Trade, it being made the chief Mart or Scale for all the Commo|dities which <HI>Bulgaria, Hungary, Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and the Countries thereabouts, yielded for the &s;upply of <HI>Italy:</HI> To advance which, the <HI>Ragu&s;eans</HI> had erected a Factory at <HI>Sophia,</HI> which as I remember, (for I was at that Place three times) con&s;i&s;ted of about 30 Merchants, who&s;e Employment was to buy Hides, Tallow, Wax, and the like, and &s;end them by Caravan to <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> from whence they were tran&s;ported to other parts of the World. The Vizier hereupon making up an account of the Profit which this little Republick could, or might have gain'd in &s;o many years, e&s;teem'd it rea&s;on|able, that the Grand Seignior, by who&s;e Wars they had gain'd, &s;hould partake of a &s;hare in their Profits, which by a Computation he made out of his own head, or with the help perhaps of his Jew-Broaker, or of the Cu&s;tomer of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he valued at &s;o high a Rate, that 300 Pur&s;es were e&s;teemed a moderate allowance to the Grand Seignior out of &s;uch va&s;t Riches which they had acquired. With this notion of the matter the Vizier called the two <HI>Ragu&s;ean</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors to his pre&s;ence, Commanding them immediately to write unto their Principals to provide with all &s;peed the 300 Pur&s;es which the Grand Seignior required from them in return of the favour and pro|tection he had given them, during his Wars with <HI>Venice.</HI> The Amba&s;&s;adors who were well acquainted with the Poverty of their State, which had for &s;everal years pa&s;t labour'd under great difficulties to pay the Annual Tribute which the <HI>Turks</HI> exacted from them, endeavour'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Vizier with a true &s;en&s;e of the impo&s;&s;ibility of rai|&s;ing &s;uch a Sum within the compa&s;s of their narrow Dominions; alledging that in the Year 1666. their whole City had been &s;ubverted by an Earthquake, in which all the Inhabitants peri&s;h'd, excepting 5000 Per&s;ons only, who by God's Providence being directed to the Fields, or Streets, were con&s;erv'd from this Univer&s;al Ruine: The which De&s;olation was &s;o grievous, that two Ages could not repair their Lo&s;&s;es, nor increa&s;e their People to their former numbers. But the Vizier who could endure no contradiction, nor excu&s;es in oppo&s;ition to his covetous de&s;ires, Commanded the Amba&s;&s;adors immediately to write to the Government to &s;end the Money, for pay|ment of which no more than 3 Months would be allow'd; at the expiration of which, the <HI>Ragu&s;eans</HI> being in no Capacity to comply, the Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent Pri&s;oners to the <HI>Seven Towers,</HI> and threatned with Tortures, and drubbing on the Feet, unle&s;s &s;peedy payment were made. After more than a Years Impri&s;onment, at the beginning of the Year 1680. by the Me|diation and Interpo&s;ition of Friends, the Bu&s;ine&s;s was Compounded for 120 Pur&s;es, but broke off again upon the time of pay|ment; which the Vizier required to be &s;a|tisfied, together with the Annual Tribute in one Payment in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following: But they alledg'd the impo&s;&s;ibility thereof, by rea|&s;on of the extream poverty of the Place, which had now for two years been de|prived of all Commerce, and the benefit of the <HI>Saline,</HI> from which their chief Re|venue did ari&s;e, and therefore humbly de|&s;ired to pay it at thrice; that is, 40 Pur&s;es the next <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and as much the Years following, with the u&s;ual Tributes. But the Vizier not contented with the&s;e Condi|tions, commanded them in his rage to be ca&s;t into a Dungeon of the Pri&s;on, and threatned to have the Torture given them. The <HI>Mufti</HI> interceded in their behalf, and laid before the Vizier the inju&s;tice of the Act, but in vain: The <HI>Kadile&s;cher</HI> or one of the Chief Ju&s;tices refu&s;ed to Sign a <HI>Hoget,</HI> or Sentence in the Ca&s;e, without po&s;itive command from the Grand Seignior.

<P>We &s;hall only add one in&s;tance more to demon&s;trate the manner and method of this Vizier in his Judicial Proceedings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Secre|tary of <HI>Holland</HI> drubb'd.</NOTE> which was in the Ca&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Debro&s;&s;es</HI> Se|cretary to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Holland,</HI> who having a Demand on the <HI>Metropolite,</HI> or Greek Bi&s;hop of <HI>Scio,</HI> for a Debt of one thou&s;and Dollars, upon non-payment of the Money call'd his Debtor to Ju&s;tice; the Pa|triarch appear'd at the <HI>Divan</HI> to defend the Cau&s;e, with &s;everal other <HI>Metropolites,</HI> &s;ome of which might re&s;emble the Debtor; <HI>De|bro&s;&s;es</HI> being asked whether he knew his Debtor, he not having &s;een him in &s;eve|ral years, made an&s;wer, That perhaps he
<PB N="5" REF="9"> did, or perhaps he did not, and pointed to a wrong Per&s;on; whereupon the Vizier call'd him <HI>Telbis,</HI> or Robber, to which he re|ply'd, <HI>That</HI> Franks <HI>were not Men of that Profe&s;&s;ion, or who made fal&s;e Pretences:</HI> The Vizier enrag'd with this An&s;wer, order'd him immediately in his pre&s;ence to have 300 drubs given him; of which ha|ving receiv'd 193, he lay &s;tunn'd, and for dead; and then upon the humble interce&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;hee</HI> a remi&s;&s;ion was granted of the remainder. Nor did the Patriarch and his Bi&s;hops carry off their Cau&s;e &s;o clear and ea&s;ie, but were forc'd to pay unto the Vizier a good part of that Sum which the Plaintiff demanded, in reward and acknowledgment of that ju&s;tice which was done them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha|racter of <HI>Kara Kiaja.</HI></NOTE>He that made at this time the greate&s;t Figure at Court next to the Vizier, was <HI>Kara Kiaja,</HI> of whom, to know him, we need give no other Character, than that he was the Vizier's great Confident, and intimate to all his Councels; for having all the ill qualifications, and mi&s;chievous Arts of the other, he was the mo&s;t likely Per|&s;on to &s;ucceed the Vizier, which we &s;hall find verified &s;ome years hereafter. He was <HI>Capitan-Pa&s;ha,</HI> or Admiral of the Gallies, which is e&s;teem'd one of the greate&s;t Places of Tru&s;t and Honour in the whole Empire; but he was remov'd from that Station, not in di&s;grace, but by favour of the Vizier, who knowing him to be a Per&s;on like him|&s;elf, and of his Humor and Principles, plac'd him near the Per&s;on of the Grand Seignior, with Title of <HI>Chimacam;</HI> and in recompence for the Commi&s;&s;ion which he had laid down, he was gratified with the Re|venue of three <HI>Pa&s;&s;alicks</HI> in <HI>Anatolia,</HI> which had been given to the late Vizier after his return from <HI>Candia</HI> in his Place. Capitan <HI>Pa&s;&s;a</HI> (of whom we have formerly made mention) was made Capitan <HI>Pa&s;ha,</HI> and this year di&s;patched with Sixty Gallies into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> for building the two Ca&s;tles upon the <HI>Bori&s;thenes:</HI> Other Preparations were not made this year for the War of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> for the <HI>Turks</HI> intending for this Campaign to remain on the defen&s;ive part, de&s;ign'd only to build tho&s;e Forts which were to Command the pa&s;&s;age of that River, and for the future to &s;top the Excur&s;ions and Pyracies of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> into the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> The <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> tho' de&s;irous of a Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> yet out of dulne&s;s, or ignorance, made faint applications for it, by the means of a &s;ingle Letter only, which was &s;ent from <HI>Mo&s;co</HI> by the hands of an <HI>Armenian</HI> who was turn'd <HI>Ru&s;&s;e,</HI> that is, one who had reconcil'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI> Church, and had no other bu&s;ine&s;s than only to deliver this Letter; the Contents of which was, <HI>That the</HI> Turks <HI>&s;hould quit</HI> Verania, <HI>and de&s;i&s;t from Building their Forts on the</HI> Bori&s;thenes, both which Propo&s;als were rejected, and no An&s;wer return'd unto the Letter.</P>
<P>So that now the Thoughts and Prepara|tions for War giving no di&s;turbance at the Port, the Grand Seignior apply'd him&s;elf to the mo&s;t &s;oft Plea&s;ures. He was not now &s;o eager in his Huntings as formerly, but attended to the more common Delights of the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> he had gotten together a par|cel of Dancing and Singing Girls, which had been pre&s;ented to him, for he would not be at the expence to buy them; tho' he was &s;o kind to them, as to have three of them at the &s;ame time with Child by him, and kept in the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> where hereafter they may prove a re&s;erve to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Line, when the Souldiers &s;hall become more want only profu&s;e of the Blood of their Empe|rors.

<P>And farther to increa&s;e the Plea&s;ures of the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plea&s;ures of the Court.</NOTE> the Grand Seignior for his Di|verti&s;ement caus'd a <HI>Dunalmah</HI> or Triumph to be made, which was repre&s;ented on the Water by multitudes of Boats hanging out Lights, and Fire-Works on the Walls of the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and a Float was made in the Sea, repre&s;enting the I&s;land of <HI>Malta,</HI> which was batter'd on all &s;ides by a Fleet of Gallies.</P>

After which, another Fire happening near the Old Palace of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> a Boy found in the Rubbi&s;h a Diamond that weigh'd 96 <HI>Carats,</HI> which he &s;old for 3 <HI>Paraws,</HI> or about two pence half-penny; and the Buyer re-&s;old it again for a <HI>Zelot,</HI> or about half a Crown, to one of tho&s;e Shops near Sultan <HI>Bajazet</HI>'s <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> which &s;ell Stones for Seals, and pieces of Chry&s;tal for Rings; and there it lay for &s;ome time unregarded, until at length the Owner not finding a Chapman, brought it to an <HI>Armenian</HI> to &s;et in Silver.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1680.</HI></NOTE>THis year began with the mo&s;t &s;olemn Council that was ever known to have been held at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Council called.</NOTE> within the me|mory Man.

The Council was &s;ummoned at the motion of the Grand Vizier, who having a Breach with the Chri&s;tian Emperor then in pro|&s;pect, had a de&s;ire to feel the Pul&s;e and try the Inclinations of the great Men, how they &s;tood affected to &s;uch an Enterpri&s;e. But it &s;eems the Propo&s;al did not very well relli&s;h; for that a <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador being on his Journey to the Port, the I&s;&s;ue or Event of his Negotiation was fir&s;t to be expected: And in the mean time, it was concluded mo&s;t &s;afe, and prudent not to Engage in another War. Be&s;ides, the Em|peror was then actually in Treaty to renew the Truce with the Grand Seignior, which in few Years terminated; and to that end, had &s;ent an Envoy extraordinary to the Port, but he dy'd before his Negotiation was accompli&s;hed, as did al&s;o three other Re&s;idents in le&s;s than the compa&s;s of one Year, <MILESTONE N="1680"> who were all employ'd to con&s;erve, and renew the Peace.</P>
<P>The preparations for War this year be|ing thus laid a&s;ide. The Vizier was at lei&s;ure to Marry his Daughter to the Grand Seignior's <HI>Hazna-Kaja&s;ee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier Marries his Daughter.</NOTE> or Privy-pur&s;e, who thereupon was promoted to be a <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> of the Divan, or Vizier of the Bench; he was e&s;teemed the Riche&s;t Man in the Empire; which the Grand Vizier &s;oon found to his high Advantage; for he dy|ing 40 Days after his Marriage, the Vizier in right of his Daughter entred into a va&s;t Inheritance. The Widow remained not long in her de&s;olate Condition, before &s;he was promi&s;ed to <HI>O&s;man</HI> then <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> who had formerly been <HI>Bo&s;tangi-Ba&s;hee,</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Gardiners,</HI> and <HI>Chi|macam</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e means the Vizier was grown &s;o Rich, and Great, and In&s;olent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faction a|gain&s;t the Vizier.</NOTE> that he created many Enemies; but the mo&s;t dan|gerous to him, was a Faction at Court, the Chief of which were the <HI>Kuzlir-Aga,</HI> or Prime Eunuch of the Women, and <HI>Solyman</HI> the <HI>Imbrahor,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, the which made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to cro&s;s the Vizier, in all his Proceedings; and di&s;ap|pointed him of preferring a favourite of his, to the place of &s;econd Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, which was lately become vacant by the death of that Officer; and one prefer'd thereunto at the recommendation of <HI>Soly|man Pa&s;ha,</HI> who was his Friend, and had been Trea&s;urer to the late Vizier. Upon which defeat the great Vizier fearing that he lo&s;t ground, and decay'd in his power and intere&s;t, thought fit to ha&s;ten his own Marriage with the Grand Seignior's Daugh|ter, a Child of 8 years of Age; who like other Sultanaes was Married to no other end, than that her Husband might have the Honour to maintain her a Court, and Equipage agreeable to a Lady of her De|gree and Quality.</P>
<P>This near Alliance to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Blood, and familiar Conver&s;ation with the Sultan, could not be procured and maintained with|out a va&s;t expence to the Vizier; who was commanded by the Grand Seignior to Treat him once, and &s;ometimes twice a Week, and at every Meal, it co&s;t him 25 Pur&s;es of Money, be&s;ides other pre&s;ents to the <HI>Valide,</HI> or Queen Mother, and other pow|erful Per&s;ons at Court to an incredible va|lue: To &s;upport which Charge, Rapine and Violence were nece&s;&s;ary, and nothing but a &s;hare in the Booty and Pray could &s;top and fortifie the Ears of the Sultan, and Mini&s;ters of the Court again&s;t the Cries, and Groans of oppre&s;&s;ed Wretches.</P>
<P>One of the ways to Rai&s;e Money, (and that e&s;teemed none of the meane&s;t) was by <HI>Avanias,</HI> or fal&s;e pretences to be made on the Amba&s;&s;adors, or Re&s;idents of Chri|&s;tian Princes, then actually re&s;iding at the Port; the violation of who&s;e Character and Office the Vizier e&s;teemed to be no Sin or Offence; being in his Opinion but Gaurs and Infidels, and &s;uch as were &s;ent for Pledges, and Pawns for the Fidelity of their Ma&s;ters to the Turks: Be&s;ides which, he conceived &s;o mean an e&s;teem of all Chri&s;ti|an Princes, and undervalued their power and courage in War; that he believed no Indignities or Di&s;honourable u&s;age could pro|voke them to a Re&s;entment, or a Revenge for any injuries received: And &s;o far had
<PB N="7" REF="10"> this belief generally prevailed, that the <HI>Pa|&s;haes,</HI> and Governours who lived at a di|&s;tance from the Port, would tell the Mer|chants, that in ca&s;e their E&s;tates were &s;eized, and one of their Hands cut off, and expelled the Country; yet &s;o wedded were they to their own Intere&s;t, and to the Delights of the Turki&s;h Air, that the next Year they would return again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier Treats the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters with Scorn.</NOTE> and adventure the like Treatment rather than forego the hopes, and &s;weetne&s;s of that profit, which they had tried, and expected in the Dominions of the Grand Seignior. The Vizier had cer|tainly thoughts like the&s;e, and the &s;ame poor and contemptible e&s;teem of Chri&s;tian Princes in compari&s;on with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force, which was no doubt one of his chief Motives to commence that fatal War, which in a few years afterwards he unhap|pily begun. And in the mean time acting on the&s;e Principles, he treated all the Chri|&s;tian Mini&s;ters at the Port with equal Scorn and Contempt.</P>
<P>To begin with the <HI>French,</HI> he deny'd to that Amba&s;&s;ador the Privilege of Sitting on the <HI>Soffra,</HI> when he admitted him to Audi|ence; an Honour formerly allowed to Chri&s;tian Repre&s;entatives; but now out of the height of Pride over-looking all the World, and not enduring to &s;ee a Chri&s;tian to &s;it either &s;o near or equal to him, the Vi|zier made it a &s;tanding Rule, That no Am|ba&s;&s;ador what&s;oever &s;hould have his Stool placed on the <HI>Soffra:</HI> But his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, who was always tender in Points which concern'd his Honour, gave po&s;itive Commands to his Amba&s;&s;ador: Not to ac|cept of Audience on any Terms derogatory to the ancient re&s;pect; and the Vizier as Re&s;olute on the other &s;ide, procured the Grand Seignior's command, to confirm that method of receiving Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;o that it was no longer an act of the Vizier's but of the Sultan's Determination: In which re|&s;olves on both &s;ides the Vizier went to <HI>Adri|anople,</HI> intending never to retract his Words; which afterwards proved true; for greater Thoughts, and Employments diverted him from other Treaties on that Matter. But before things proceeded thus far, the Vizier called this Amba&s;&s;ador to an Account for what the <HI>French-men</HI> of War had acted a|gain&s;t the <HI>Tripolins,</HI> by violating the Grand Seignior's Port of <HI>Scio,</HI> for that People ha|ving committed many Pyracies on the <HI>French</HI> Nation, and then actually in War with them, were Roving in the Seas of the <HI>Archepelago,</HI> and there unhappily meeting with their Enemy, the <HI>French,</HI> they took Refuge and Shelter under the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Scio:</HI> The <HI>French-men</HI> of War being animated again&s;t their Enemy, and tempted with the &s;ight of their Prey &s;o near, and within their view, entred the Port and made &s;everal Shot at the <HI>Tripolins,</HI> &s;ome of which coming a Shoar and doing &s;ome little Damage to the People; it was interpreted as a Breach of the Peace, and Violation of the Grand Seignior's Port.<NOTE PLACE="marg">the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador impri&s;oned.</NOTE> Complaints whereof being brought to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> the Vizier &s;ent for the Amba&s;&s;a|dor to his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and without &s;eeing him, committed him Pri&s;oner to the Cu&s;tody of the <HI>Chaous-Ba&s;hee;</HI> Demanding Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns for reparation of the Dama|ges which the <HI>French</HI> Ships had done at the Port of <HI>Scio,</HI> and al&s;o in &s;atisfaction for the affront which they had done to the Grand Seignior in the Violation of his Port, which amounted unto no le&s;s than an ab&s;olute Breach of the Peace. The Amba&s;&s;ador re|mained &s;ome Nights under this re&s;traint with menaces, and threats of being removed thence to the Seven Towers: During which time the Cu&s;tomer (<HI>Hu&s;aein-Aga,</HI> (who was always made the Agi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ator between the Vizier, and the Frank Nations) pre&s;&s;ed the Amba&s;|&s;ador with much earne&s;tne&s;s, to an accom|modation with the Vizier: And indeed there was Rea&s;on for it, becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t time, that ever the Vizier had right in his demands; for certainly the Actions of the <HI>French</HI> Ships at <HI>Scio</HI> were not to be ju&s;tifi|ed, nor otherwi&s;e to be judged than as Acts of Ho&s;tility. The Agreement was carried &s;o privately between the Amba&s;&s;ador and the Cu&s;tomer, that after a confinement of three Days and Nights, the Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;et at Liberty, with a Rumour over all the Town of being acquited and cleared with|out any payment, or engagement what&s;oe|ver. But time, which brings all things to light, did by the event di&s;cover about three or four Months afterwards, that the great Sum demanded was to be paid tho' in &s;uch a manner, that the Payment &s;eemed noti|onal and figurative only, by which a tenth part was taken for the whole. And not to concern the King's Honour therein, the tender of this Satisfaction was not to be made in Pre&s;ence of the Amba&s;&s;ador, but by the Secretary and &s;ome Merchants; who were to give it out to the World, as an Act of their own, and as if they had paid the price at their own expence, rather than their Trade &s;hould be ob&s;tructed by an open Rupture. But what&s;oever was ru|moured abroad, and what Tricks were jug|led under Hand, the Grand Seignior took it for granted, that the Money or the value thereof in Goods was to be laid down, and that the King by his Amba&s;&s;ador or Agents under him, was to be concerned in the Atonement which was offered in Sati&s;|faction for the late Tre&s;pa&s;s: And that he might not be deceived herein; the Grand Seignior contrary to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, which
<PB N="8" REF="11"> was to refer all &s;uch Negotiations as the&s;e to the management of the Vizier, would him&s;elf be pre&s;ent at this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; per|haps becau&s;e he would fancy that Great King actually at the foot of his Throne, offering his Pre&s;ents and Sacrifices for a Reconciliation. And indeed the Scene open'd not much unlike it, for when the Curtain was drawn up, behold the Grand Seignior &s;eated in Maje&s;ty on his Throne, and beneath him the Secretary and Agents of the <HI>French</HI> Na|tion, pro&s;trating them&s;elves with their Pre|&s;ents before him; and then the U&s;her of the R. Pre&s;ence Proclaim'd with an audible Voice, <HI>Behold the Agents &s;ent from the King of</HI> France <HI>to humble them&s;elves before our My&s;te|rious Emperor, and in the Name of that their King to offer their Pre&s;ents in &s;atisfaction for that A&s;&s;ront and In&s;ult which the</HI> French <HI>Ships offer'd at the Port of</HI> Scio. After which the Pre&s;ents were produc'd according to the Li&s;t, and an E&s;timate &s;et upon them. As namely, <HI>Here is a Piece of Sattin value &s;o much, a Piece of Cloth of Gold &s;o much, a Clock at &s;uch a Rate,</HI> all Priz'd and E&s;timated at ten times more than their worth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matters jugled be|tween the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> which the Grand Seignior did either little under&s;tand, or at lea&s;t was willing to over&s;ee; having perhaps other more &s;ecret In|trigues then in agitation between him&s;elf and the Court of <HI>France,</HI> things at that time tending to a Breach between the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Em|peror of <HI>Germany.</HI> Or perhaps the Grand Seignior was well enough &s;atisfied in gaining his Point, which was to &s;ee Agents from <HI>France</HI> humbling them&s;elves before him in that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor did the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador receive much better treatment, for be&s;ides &s;everal preceeding <HI>Avanias,</HI> one whereof was ca&s;t on the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company in general, on oc|ca&s;ion of a va&s;t Sum of <HI>Lion</HI> Dollars im|ported to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> which at that time was the mo&s;t hopeful Trade. Upon notice of the Importation of &s;o immen&s;e a Sum in ready Money, the Vizier's heart was enlarg'd, &s;o that he &s;wallow'd down a great &s;hare thereof within his imagination and de&s;ires;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Troubles on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants.</NOTE> and to bring the &s;ub&s;tance nearer to him, he pretended that they were fal&s;e Money, and brought into the Grand Seigniors Dominions to Cheat and Defraud his Subjects with Coyn of a low and ba&s;e Alloy. To prove the truth of this Allegation, Commands were &s;ent to <HI>Aleppo</HI> to try the Money, which accordingly was done, in the pre&s;ence of the Chief Officers; and tho' they receiv'd a full demon&s;tration of the true intrin&s;ick value, according to the legal Standard of that Money, yet there was need of Pre&s;ents to obtain &s;uch a favourable Report as might &s;atisfie the Vizier, and make the Money currant in the Country. But be the <HI>Hoget</HI> or Report what it would, it could never content the Vizier, who in&s;i&s;ted that the Certificates were fal&s;e, and gain'd by Bribery and Corruption; and therefore for his bet|ter a&s;&s;urance, he would &s;end for the Money to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> or at lea&s;t for a great part thereof, that an a&s;&s;ay or proof of its good|ne&s;s might be made in his pre&s;ence. In &s;hort, to avoid &s;o great a lo&s;s and mi&s;chief to the Merchants, 17000 Dollars were pre|&s;ented to the Vizier and his Officers to take off farther pretences from that Money; which, with the Pre&s;ents and Charges at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> amounted to more than 20000 Dollars.</P>
<P>Some Months after this, the Vi&s;ier want|ing a new Pretence to draw more Money from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, he &s;ignified to the Amba&s;&s;ador, Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> his de&s;ire to have the Capitulations &s;ent to him by the hand of his Interpreter, on pretence of reading &s;ome particular Articles therein for his own Information, and In&s;truction. The Vizier accordingly having them in his hand, de|tain'd them, &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Trick put on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor.</NOTE> <HI>That there were &s;e|veral Articles therein, which being contrary to the Turki&s;h Law, and prejudicial to the Grand Seignior's Power and Revenue were to be made void and null, which he would take care to expunge, and would afterwards return unto the Amba&s;&s;ador another Capitulation.</HI> This new Method of proceeding was very &s;urprizing to Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> then Lord Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; who being dive&s;ted of their defen&s;ive Arms, and of tho&s;e Articles on which all their &s;e|curity in that Country was e&s;tabli&s;h'd, look'd on them&s;elves and their E&s;tates as expos'd to the will and arbitrary plea&s;ure of the <HI>Turks.</HI> It &s;eem'd now as if our Nation remain'd in a &s;tate of War, or in a Condition of Out-lawed People, being deprived of our Law and Privileges. The Con&s;uls did u&s;ually carry the Authentick Copies of the Capitu|lations with them, when&s;oever they appear'd before the <HI>Kadies,</HI> or Ju&s;tices; but the Ori|ginal Exemplar being taken away, the force of the Copies ceas'd, and tho&s;e Articles could not be produc'd, in Plea for us, as formerly they were. This Matter relating to a &s;tate of War and Peace, was tran&s;mit|ted home to his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ideration; who was humbly intreated by the <HI>Turkey</HI> Company to take notice thereof in Letters directed to the Grand Seignior, and the Vizier. But in the mean time the inconve|niences were &s;o great, and the ob&s;tructions to Trade &s;o in&s;upportable, that it was thought fit to ran&s;om our Capitulations out of Captivity at any rate, rather than to ha|zard all our Intere&s;t by the want of them. So that a Treaty being commenc'd, it was agree'd, that upon payment of 50 Pur&s;es of Money, being 25 thou&s;and Dollars, the Ca|pitulations
<PB N="9" REF="11"> &s;hould be re&s;tor'd, which was ac|cordingly perform'd.</P>
<P>In this Condition things &s;tood, when the Lord <HI>Chandois,</HI> another Amba&s;&s;ador from his Maje&s;ty, arriv'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> bringing, be&s;ides his Credentials, Letters to the Grand Seignior and Vizier, containing no other matter than Complaints of that unworthy Seizure of the Capitulations, and of the Price and Ran&s;om paid for them; an Action &s;o &s;trange and new, that an Example of the like nature was never known, or heard of in the World. The Vizier, contrary to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, being touched with a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame for &s;o mean an Action; did de&s;ire that the Letter of this Tenure from our King to the Grand Seignior might be &s;mothered, and not delivered; promi&s;ing to make re&s;ti|tution of the Fifty pur&s;es, he had taken on that occa&s;ion. This offer from the Vizier &s;eemed a thing incredible, and as impo&s;&s;ible to redeem a Soul out of Hell, as a Pur&s;e of Money out of his Coffers: How&s;oever, &s;o touched he was with the &s;en&s;e of this Act, of which the Grand Seignior had as yet no knowledge, nor taken any &s;hare in the Booty, that he ordered Twenty nine pur&s;es of the Money to be re&s;tored; but with &s;o ill a Grace, and &s;o unplea&s;ant a Countenance, that our Merchants apprehended &s;ome other Contrivances, and Machinations to be re|paid again with a &s;evere intere&s;t; which might probably have been expected, had not the Vizier been diverted from the&s;e low acqui|&s;itions to matters of higher concernment in <HI>Hungary:</HI> How&s;oever, before his departure he left tho&s;e menacing promi&s;es behind him, which threatned no le&s;s than Ruin and De|&s;truction at his Return. We might here recount &s;everal other Acts of inju&s;tice pa&s;|&s;ed on our Nation: As the encouragement of the <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Tunis,</HI> to make demands on our Amba&s;&s;ador for what Goods the Cor|&s;aires, or Pirates had taken from him, on one of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships: And tho' out of the re&s;pect and deference which the Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> and the Great Ma&s;ter of <HI>Malta</HI> bore to the Maje&s;ty of our King, and by the indu&s;try and good management of Sir <HI>John Finch,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> the greate&s;t part of the Goods and Money taken were re&s;tored, for which the <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> declared him&s;elf &s;atisfied; yet this <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> receiving countenance and encourage|ment from this Vizier in his preten&s;ions, demanded 450 Pur&s;es to be paid him by the Amba&s;&s;ador, for the remaining Goods which were not recovered. And tho' this preten|&s;ion in the late Vizier's time, (a Man of more Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on than this pre&s;ent) was ca&s;t out, and qua&s;hed; yet the <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> looking on this conjuncture, as the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable of any, when the mo&s;t extrava|gant demands would be heard and favoured, renewed his Suit, and pleaded it before the Vizier with as many Lyes, and fal&s;e Te&s;ti|monies as were required, or could be inven|ted to give colour to an evil Ca&s;e. The Vizier hearkned mo&s;t devoutly to all the Allegations, and with a bended Brow, and a &s;tern Countenance told the Amba&s;&s;ador, <HI>That he was to an&s;wer for the Blood and E&s;tates of the</HI> Turks, <HI>which were lo&s;t Aboard our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Ships:</HI> And again turning to the <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> told him, That his Demands were too unrea&s;onable and extravagant; and &s;o me|diating, as it were, &s;ometimes on one &s;ide and &s;ometimes on the other, with de&s;ign to take on both Hands, he at length fairly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the Audience: And in the Afternoon made a propo&s;al by his <HI>Kaja</HI> or Deputy ab|&s;olutely to &s;uper&s;ede the Cau&s;e, provided that Fifteen pur&s;es, were given to him, and Seven to his <HI>Kaja,</HI> and <HI>Reis-Effendi,</HI> who is Secretary of State. In &s;hort, after divers Treaties on this Subject, an Ac|commodation was made with a great Sum, other bu&s;ine&s;&s;es being entred and pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Agreement.</P>
<P>The next which comes into play is the <HI>Venetian Bailo</HI> or Amba&s;&s;ador, who about the beginning of this Year 1680, was &s;ent by that Republick to re&s;ide at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI> his name was <HI>Ciurani,</HI> a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> and one who had formerly been General in <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> he was e&s;teemed an Avaritious and a &s;elf-intere&s;&s;ed Per&s;on, a great Merchant, and a great Politician, and one made up of Intrigues and De&s;igns. His fir&s;t Enterpri&s;e, which was to Cheat the <HI>Turks,</HI> proved un|lucky: For having brought a great quan|tity of Cloth of Gold with him, which was his own Merchandize and Adventure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vene|tians</HI> in trouble.</NOTE> he endeavoured to &s;ave the Cu&s;tom by Lan|ding it under the notion of Pre&s;ents, which were to be made to the Grand Seignior, and the Officers of his Court. The Goods were privately convey'd a Shoar in the Night by Boats belonging to the Ships of War, which had brought the Amba&s;&s;a|dor, and defended by a Guard of <HI>Albani|ans,</HI> who are a company of lu&s;ty Fellows, to the number of Thirty, maintained by the Republick only to carry Letters to <HI>Zara,</HI> or <HI>Cataro</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> from whence by a <HI>Felucca</HI> they are Tran&s;ported to <HI>Venice:</HI> A Party of the&s;e Men I &s;ay conducted the&s;e Goods, and in de&s;pight of the Cu&s;tomer's Officers carried them to the <HI>Bailaggio,</HI> or Hou&s;e belonging to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dors. The Cu&s;tomer <HI>U&s;aine Aga,</HI> who had notice of all that pa&s;&s;ed, di&s;&s;embled at fir&s;t his knowledge thereof, and contrived with the High Trea&s;urer to &s;end one of his Ser|vants to Buy a con&s;iderable parcel of the Cloth of Gold for the u&s;e of the <HI>Seraglio:</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12"> And in regard different Sortments and Co|lours were demanded, it was nece&s;&s;ary to open and unpack divers Che&s;ts; by which means they came to a full di&s;covery of all tho&s;e Goods, which had privately been convey'd away by Night. When the&s;e Chapmen had concluded their Bargains, and agreed on the Prices, which amounted unto 3500 Dollars, they gave an A&s;&s;ignment for the Money on <HI>U&s;aine Aga</HI> the Chief Cu&s;tomer; who willingly accepted the Bill, but to abate it out of the Cu&s;toms due for tho&s;e Goods, making up the Account after his own fa&s;hion: But not content herewith, he obtained a Warrant from the Vizier di|rected to the Judge of <HI>Galata,</HI> to examine the manner of carrying the&s;e Goods a-&s;hoar in the Night by Force and Violence; which being made out by &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es, a re|port thereof was &s;ent to the Vizier, who immediately thereupon gave Orders to the <HI>Vaivod,</HI> and Captain of <HI>Galata</HI> to make Search in the Hou&s;e of the Cu&s;tomer for tho&s;e Goods, which had not paid the Cu&s;tom. Seignior <HI>Ciurani</HI> Alarmed at this manner of Proceeding, and not willing to give an occa&s;ion to the Turks to violate the re|&s;pect due to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Venice,</HI> (which until that time was ever e&s;teemed a San|ctuary, and place of Refuge) &s;ea&s;onably compounded for his unju&s;tifyable mi&s;carri|age by the Payment of 30000 Dollars.</P>
<P>But this trouble was no &s;ooner ended, be|fore another of wor&s;e Con&s;equence began, ari&s;ing from certain Slaves to the number of about Fifty, which had &s;aved them&s;elves aboard the <HI>Venetian</HI> Men of War which had brought the Amba&s;&s;ador, of which Com|plaint being made by the Ma&s;ters unto the Vizier, Orders were given twice to make &s;earch aboard the Ships for them; but by help of a little Money, Inqui&s;itions were made &s;o &s;uperficially, that Returns were given of none to be found. But the Complaints daily increa&s;ing, new Orders were given to renew the Search, the execution whereof was committed to a <HI>Capugee</HI> and a <HI>Ha&s;akee,</HI> who are Officers belonging to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> together with a <HI>Naip</HI> or <HI>Kadee</HI>'s Notary, who was to write down and record the pro|ceedings. The&s;e per&s;ons being come aboard, and rudely making &s;earch after their man|ner, the Soldiers aro&s;e again&s;t them, and beat them off, wounding &s;ome and throw|ing the <HI>Naip</HI> and others into the Sea. Up|on report whereof the Vizier was &s;o enraged, that he would have had the Ships brought to the Ar&s;enal, there to be laid up and con|fi&s;cated to the Grand Seignior's Service. The two <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors fearing al&s;o &s;ome violence to their Per&s;ons from the&s;e di&s;orders, betook them&s;elves to their Ships, there to remain until Matters were a little pacified; and to make the bu&s;ine&s;s more ea&s;y, the Slaves (about whom was all the controver&s;ie) were privately convey'd a&s;hoar: And a Search of the Ships &s;ubmitted unto by con&s;ent, and Propo&s;al of the Amba&s;&s;a|dors them&s;elves. The Vizier being a little mollified with this compliance, the <HI>Chiaus-ba&s;hee</HI> (or Chief of the <HI>Pur&s;uivants</HI>) with 200 Men were &s;ent aboard the Ships to make a &s;earch, where being received with|out oppo&s;ition, they left no corner of the Ships un&s;ought and unlooked into, and none being found, the <HI>Chiaus-ba&s;hee</HI> gave them a favourable report upon payment of 300 <HI>Che|quins:</HI> After which the <HI>Bailos</HI> or Amba&s;&s;a|dors returned a&s;hoar, referring a farther Ac|commodation of their Matters to <HI>U&s;aine Aga</HI> the Cu&s;tomer, who was a mo&s;t dexterous Per&s;on, both in rai&s;ing <HI>Avanias</HI> or fal&s;e Pre|tences, and in the Ways and Arts of com|po&s;ing them. And he accordingly &s;o mana|ged the matter, that with payment of Se|venty pur&s;es to the Vizier, and Ten to the <HI>Kaja,</HI> with other petty rewards to <HI>U&s;aine Aga</HI> him&s;elf, and other inferiour Officers, which might in all amount to about 50000 Dollars, all Di&s;plea&s;ures were reconciled, the new <HI>Bailo</HI> was Friendly admitted to Audi|ence, and the old one &s;uffered fairly to de|part: The Ma&s;ters lo&s;t their Slaves, and the Vizier got the Money. But the Troubles of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Mini&s;ters did not end here: For not long afterwards, &s;ome De&s;turbances aro&s;e in <HI>Dalmatia</HI> between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the Subjects of that Republick, in which a|bove a Hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> as was reported,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Vene|tian Bailo <HI>Impri&s;oned.</HI></NOTE> being Cut off, the Vizier in a Rage &s;ent the <HI>Bailo</HI> Pri&s;oner to the &s;even Towers, Threatning to put him to Death; but with the Atone|ment of 200.000 Dollars, the Vizier's gentle Heart was melted, and all things &s;alved up and reconciled again once more. But the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> to who&s;e expences the Sum of 300.000 Dollars was charged, could not &s;o ea&s;ily dige&s;t this Extortion; and knowing that with the <HI>Turks</HI> there was no other remedy but patience until &s;uch time as opportunity happened to revenge it, did in the interim &s;how their re&s;entment, by their di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Seignior <HI>Ciurani</HI> their Amba&s;&s;ador, whom they recalled &s;peedi|ly from his Employment, and con&s;tituted the Secretary in his place; and afterwards levied a great part of the Money paid unto the <HI>Turks</HI> out of his E&s;tate, and out of the E|&s;tate of <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> the old <HI>Bailo.

<P>The next Foreign Mini&s;ter which mu&s;t ta&s;t of the Vizier's kindne&s;s, was the <HI>Geno|e&s;e</HI> Re&s;ident. And tho' neither the Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor the Actions of that Nation did Admini|&s;ter any ground of pretence to extort Money from them; yet, the Vizier made an <HI>Avania</HI> of 5000 Dollars upon them, for what cau&s;e no Man knows, nor do the <HI>Ge|noe&s;e</HI> them&s;elves declare any. It is conjectur|ed he would not &s;uffer their Re&s;ident Seig|nior <HI>Spinola</HI> to depart without payment of that Sum, upon pretence that during all the time of his Re&s;idence, he had never &s;een the Grand Seignior.</P>
<P>The new Re&s;ident who &s;ucceeded to <HI>Spi|nola,</HI> had been the <HI>Sopra-cargo</HI> of a Ship, and was rather a Factor than a Publick Mini&s;ter; for the State of <HI>Genoua</HI> had re|fu&s;ed to have any concernment in <HI>Turky:</HI> How&s;oever, they lent their name to certain Merchants for 6000 Dollars a year, who in Con&s;ideration of the Con&s;olage to be con|firmed to them, were to maintain a Re&s;i|dent at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and a Con&s;ul at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> After which the <HI>Camera</HI> was to know no|thing of any expence, but all &s;orts of Charges and <HI>Avanias</HI> were to be born by the Un|dertakers; who allowed their Re&s;ident 1500 Dollars <HI>per annum,</HI> which with the benefit of making Strong-waters, and &s;elling of Wine in his Hou&s;e, and with ways of Thrifty li|ving, was e&s;teemed a good &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for a Per&s;on of his quality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> in Troubles.</NOTE>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ter which had for a long time e&s;caped Troubles, and <HI>Avanias</HI> rather by good fortune than any good cunning, did at length, on occa&s;ion of an unavoida|ble Di&s;pute with <HI>U&s;aine Aga</HI> the Cu&s;tomer, fall within reach of the Vizier's Hand: And tho' the Re&s;ident fore&s;aw the Mi&s;chief, and would have avoided the Blow by &s;ubmit|ting every thing to the Judgment of the Cu|&s;tomer him&s;elf; yet, to gain the Merit of bring|ing &s;uch a Client before the Vizier, who could never depart from before his Tribunal with|out paying roundly for his Ju&s;tice, he im|mediately preferred his Memorial again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> Re&s;ident; &s;aying, <HI>That he would not be Judge and Party, lea&s;t he &s;hould be over|partial to him&s;elf, but would re&s;t content and &s;ubmit to any Sentence which the Vizier &s;hould pronounce in publick</HI> Divan. Accordingly a <HI>Boiardee,</HI> or Warrant was &s;ent by a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to cite the <HI>Dutch</HI> Re&s;ident's <HI>Druggerman,</HI> or Interpreter to appear in <HI>Divan</HI> with the Capitulations; which being brought thi|ther, were there detained after the manner of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on pretence that the Vizier would peru&s;e them; tho' as appears by the &s;equel his Intentions were to make them pay their Ran&s;om as our Capitulations had done before; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> objected again&s;t us, as a leading Card to them, and that our ea&s;ine&s;s in yielding to &s;uch an un|parallell'd Extortion, had given the Vizier Encouragment to enterpri&s;e the like upon them. It was in the year 1610, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> fir&s;t made their Capitulations with the <HI>Turks;</HI> &s;ince which time they were but once renewed, about Forty &s;ix years ago in the time of <HI>Sultan Morat;</HI> and then their Articles were not de&s;cribed at large in many Points, only in general it was declared, <HI>That they &s;hould extend to all the Particulars as largely, and in as ample a manner, to all Privi|leges and Immunities, as did the</HI> Engli&s;h. The Vizier upon Con&s;ideration of the mat|ter, was not willing to find particulars in generals, nor to interpret Articles with &s;uch va&s;t Comprehen&s;ions as divers <HI>&amp; caetera</HI>'s would imply; and therefore told the <HI>Dutch, That they mu&s;t either receive their Capitula|tions back, with &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions only, as were expre&s;&s;ed in open Terms; or otherwi&s;e be contented with the expence of renewing of them, in &s;uch an Explicite manner as might refer nothing to an interpretation out of Ge|nerals.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> who were contented with their old Capitulations, and affrighted with the Charge of new ones, knowing how apt the Vizier was to inflame the Reckoning, kept off at a di&s;tance for &s;ome time, Ar|guing the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a Con|&s;traint, and the validity of their pre&s;ent Articles, than which they de&s;ired no others. How&s;oever, the Vizier kept the Capitu|lations, and the Cu&s;tomer interpreted them after his own Sence, and in his own Favour. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had at that time &s;everal Ships under Convoy of their State's Men of War arrived at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> to which they gave Orders not to enter the Port, but to lie off without the Ca&s;tle, as if they intended to break off all Commerce; and in ca&s;e their Capitulations were not re&s;tored, to cau&s;e their Fleet to return back to the Ports from whence they came. But the Vizier and the Cu&s;tomer were not moved with this Bravade; for tho' they were not very well ver&s;ed in Maritine, or Mercantile affairs, yet they were not ignorant how far a Ma&s;ter of a Ship was obliged to deliver the Goods laden on his Ve&s;&s;el at the Port, to which they were de&s;igned; nor did they unrea&s;onably calculate the Charge of returning the Con|voy.
<PB N="12" REF="13"> with the lo&s;s and overthrow of their Voyage, to be far greater than the Bar|gain which was to be made for Re&s;titution, or renewal of their Capitulations. How&s;oe|ver, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were of Opinion, That this Su&s;pen&s;ion of Trade would mortifie the Cu&s;tomer, and incline the Vizier to better Terms; when after Fifty days hanging off, and that divers great Ships of their Convoy had lain almo&s;t all that time upon an ex|pen&s;ive and heavy demorage; at length the Re&s;ident being &s;ooner weary thereof, than the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;en&s;ible of the failure of Trade, became de&s;irous to Treat about an Accommodation. The per&s;on employ'd here|in was the Vizier's own <HI>Jew Broker,</HI> (for all the great Men in <HI>Turky</HI> have one of this Race depending on their Families, who &s;erve them for Setters and Pandors to their intere&s;t and plea&s;ures.) This <HI>Jew</HI> being dex|terous in his my&s;tery of making Bargains, concluded with the <HI>Dutch</HI> to have their Ca|pitulations renewed; and to have all the dubious Points explained and di&s;tended at large, in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are: And then in &s;atisfaction, and return for &s;o favourable an Indulgence, Fifty pur&s;es of Money were to be paid to the Vizier, Ten to his <HI>Kaja,</HI> Three to the <HI>Reis-Effendi,</HI> or Chief Secretary, and Eight to <HI>U&s;aine Aga</HI> the Cu&s;tomer: After which Orders were &s;ent to the Convoy to enter within the Port of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which might have been done at fir&s;t without expence or lo&s;s of time; for certainly the detention of the Convoy &s;er|ved nothing to the ea&s;ier, and more ready Accommodation of this Affair. I have known many Examples of this nature in my own time in <HI>Turky;</HI> and could never find that the &s;topping Ships from entering into Port, did ever Operate upon the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Officers, and only &s;erved to increa&s;e our Expence, and add to the Afflictions of our other Aggrievances, which we received from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did the Vizier Treat all the Mini|&s;ters of Foreign Princes with a Scorn, and Contempt as became &s;uch as were his Va&s;|&s;als, or Tributaries to his Ma&s;ter, neither &s;howing them Re&s;pect or Honour, nor af|fording them Ju&s;tice: And when at any time an injured Amba&s;&s;ador asked of him the Rea|&s;ons why he was &s;o &s;everely u&s;ed, and what Crime he had committed, he would readily an&s;wer, <HI>Do you not Breath in the Grand Seig|niors Air, and will you pay him nothing for it?</HI> Wherefore we may not wonder, that the <HI>Venetians</HI> on the Provocations be|fore-mention'd, &s;hould in &s;o few years after the Conclu&s;ion of a long War, break out again with the <HI>Turk,</HI> and joyn with the Em|peror again&s;t this Common Enemy, whom neither Articles, nor Solemn Promi&s;es could keep within the Bounds of Common Hu|manity. And when we con&s;ider, how the ju&s;t God doth humble the Proud, we may not wonder to &s;ee how manife&s;tly, the Di|vine Providence hath appeared in Defence of the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, even to a Miracle again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> who at that time had exalted them&s;elves to &s;uch a pitch of Pride, and Opinion of their own Force, as if they had been Omnipotent and Invincible, and were minded to verifie their own &s;aying, <HI>That God had made the Earth for their Domi|nion, and Enjoyment, and the Sea only for the Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>Thus had Pride, Rapine and Avarice ari|&s;en to their Zenith and highe&s;t Sphere unto which they could reach, and all tho&s;e Cor|ruptions and Irregularities in Ju&s;tice, which u&s;ually overthrow Kingdoms and Empires &s;eem'd now to be con&s;ummated, and the Governors to have fulfill'd the mea&s;ure of their Iniquity. Luxury and La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s may weaken and enervate a People, but Tyranny and Inju&s;tice mo&s;t commonly Sub|vert the whole Fabrick of Government. Avarice, which is the root of all Evils, and which provokes and incites to Tyranny and Violence, was the ruine of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em|pire; of which we &s;hall produce a mo&s;t pregnant Example in the Conduct of this Vizier, when we come to Treat of his Con|duct in the &s;ucceeding War, before he laid Siege to the City of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>

<P>WE are entred now into another year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<P>The Grand Seignior having built a Se|raglio on <HI>Galata</HI> &s;ide, near the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> many of the Workmen, and poor Labourers, both <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> not being pay'd, gave a Petition to the Grand Seignior for their Money; the Grand Seignior readily gave them an A&s;&s;ignment under his own hand for their Payment, directed to the <HI>Tefterday</HI> or Lord Trea&s;urer; but he &s;ent them to the Vizier, who clap'd twenty three of them into Pri&s;on, and next day in publick Divan, order'd them to be drubb'd;
<PB N="13" REF="13"> telling them, <HI>That if he heard more of their Complaints, he would &s;end them to the Gal|lies.</HI></P>
<P>But all the&s;e were petty Matters in Com|pari&s;on with that greater De&s;ign he had of rai&s;ing Money; which was by laying a Tax on all Lands throughout the Empire, call'd the <HI>Sor&s;at,</HI> whereby it was propos'd to levy at lea&s;t fourteen thou&s;and Pur&s;es, of which the Vizier made an account of at lea&s;t two thou&s;and for his own &s;hare; (the <HI>Sor&s;at</HI> is the greate&s;t Tax the <HI>Turks</HI> impo&s;e on their People, being laid on every Acre of Glebe Land where the Plow goes.) The pretence for which was, the Grand Seignior's Remo|val to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> for adju&s;ting the Limits of <HI>Poland.</HI> But this De&s;ign was di&s;appoint|ed by the contrary Faction of the <HI>Kuzlir Aga,</HI> and <HI>Solyman Kaja,</HI> who by the Queen Mother repre&s;ented to the Grand Seignior, that this Journey being only of Plea&s;ure, and not de&s;ign'd in order to a War, he could not without an oppre&s;&s;ion of his Peo|ple rai&s;e &s;uch a Tax, which in former times was never Levied by their Wi&s;e&s;t Emperors, but on great Emergencies, and on occa&s;ion of pre&s;&s;ing Exigencies; &s;o the Grand Seig|nior, like a good Prince, gave an&s;wer to the Vizier, <HI>That he would &s;pare his Subjects for the pre&s;ent, in regard that he, and the</HI> Valide Sultana, <HI>had &s;ufficient in the Trea&s;ury where|with to defray their own Expences.</HI></P>
<P>How&s;oever the Vizier &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on this Point, arguing that the intent of removal to <HI>Adrianople</HI> was not a Journey of Plea&s;ure; but (if the Grand Seignior &s;o pleas'd) in order to a War again&s;t the Emperor of <HI>Ger|many;</HI> for never was there a Conjuncture more favourable than at pre&s;ent, when the Rebels under the Command of Count <HI>Teckeley</HI> invited them to a Conque&s;t of all that Countrey; and particularly of <HI>Raab,</HI> which having been formerly under the Do|minion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> could not without di&s;honour to the Empire, and &s;candal to Re|ligion be relinqui&s;h'd, and &s;uffer'd to remain in the hands of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> when it might without much blood or expence be recover'd. To which the Grand Seignior made an&s;wer, <HI>That</HI> Raab <HI>had not been lo&s;t in his days, nor in the Reigns of his Father, or Uncle, and therefore that the recovery thereof did le&s;s concern him; and that for his own part, he had &s;ufficiently enlarg'd his Em|pire by the addition of</HI> Newhaw&s;el, Candia, Caminiee, Ukrania, <HI>and the appurtenances thereunto belonging; the which Conque&s;ts had &s;o hara&s;&s;ed his Souldiers, and burthen'd his People, that he was re&s;olv'd to put an end unto his Wars, and give repo&s;e and ea&s;e unto his Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there was neither Peace with the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> nor open Wars; the Trea|ties were in a manner ended, no great Pre|parations were making for the following year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Things doubtful with <HI>Mo&s;|covy.</HI></NOTE> but every thing remain'd in a kind of &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and in this Condition of Affairs the Vizier advis'd the Grand Seignior to re|move with his Court unto <HI>Adrianople</HI> in a Warlike po&s;ture, which might alarm the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> and incline them to better Terms and Articles of Peace. The Grand Seignior a&s;&s;ented thereunto, and about the beginning of <HI>November</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Adrianople.</HI></P>
<P>But before the Vizier was well &s;etled in that City, he was forc'd for his own &s;afety to cut off his belov'd <HI>Kaja,</HI> a Creature of his own, who was admirably fitted for his purpo&s;e; for he was grown &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly avaritious, and &s;o publickly rapacious, without any fear or &s;hame, that he was hated and dete&s;ted by all Mankind. And here, if ever, the Cur&s;e of <HI>David</HI> was re|ally fulfill'd of him and his Ma&s;ter; <HI>Let a Wicked Man be &s;et over them, and let Satan &s;tand at his right hand.</HI> And tho' the Vizier had no great need of a Tempter to pro|voke or incite him to catch at his Prey, yet this Devil being mo&s;t excellently Saga|cious in finding out and &s;tarting Game, and skilful in all the Arts of Intriguing, he was mo&s;t intimate and dear to his Ma&s;ter, and e&s;teem'd the more u&s;eful In&s;trument, be|cau&s;e he was &s;o bold as to be content to bear the di&s;grace, and to &s;tand between the Vizier, and the Clamours of the People; which were now become &s;o common, and general by the out-cries of the multi|tude, that the Vizier to &s;ave him&s;elf, was forc'd to offer him a Sacrifice to their tu|multuous rage. The occa&s;ion was this.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Summer the Grand Seignior at the in&s;tigation of the Mufti, and of other Zealots of the <HI>Mahometan-Law,</HI> had i&s;&s;ued out divers &s;evere Edicts again&s;t Taverns, and <HI>Boza-Shops.</HI> This <HI>Boza</HI> is a certain &s;ort of Liquor made of that Grain which by us is call'd <HI>Millet,</HI> which is fumatick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cau&s;e that mov'd the Vizier to cut off his <HI>Kaja.</HI></NOTE> and as inebriating as our &s;tronge&s;t Ale; and with which the <HI>Turks</HI> would be as drunk, and more quarrel&s;om and mutinous than if they had drank of the juice of the Grape; and therefore the <HI>Ulamah,</HI> or Expo&s;itors of their Law, gave their Opinions that it was as unlawful as Wine; for that &s;ince it was their Prophet's intention to prohibit Drun|kenne&s;s, it was an illu&s;ion of his Precept to forbid Wine, and at the &s;ame time to allow of other more intoxicating and inebriating Liquors; wherefore as often as the Grand Seignior renew'd his Decrees again&s;t Wine, he enjoyn'd the &s;ame Penalties again&s;t drink|ing <HI>Boza,</HI> which was a very heavy and grievous Le&s;&s;on to the People; for <HI>Boza-&s;hops</HI> were become almo&s;t as common in <HI>Turkey,</HI> as Ale-hou&s;es are in <HI>England,</HI> and to &s;uppre&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="14"> them, would be a like inconvenience. Wherefore upon return of the Grand Seig|nior la&s;t year unto <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the <HI>Boza</HI>-Hou&s;ekeepers made their Addre&s;&s;es to the Vizier for a Di&s;pen&s;ation with the Sultan's Decree and Licen&s;e to &s;ell <HI>Boza</HI> publickly as before; the <HI>Kaja</HI> boldly enters into a Treaty, and concludes with them for &s;ixty Pur&s;es, which &s;o &s;oon as the Grand Seignior was de|parted were paid, and the Licen&s;e given, and the <HI>Cape,</HI> or Chief of that Trade was with Ceremony ve&s;ted by the <HI>Chimacam,</HI> who came al&s;o into a &s;hare of the benefit. But this matter could not long remain a Se|cret before it was made known to the Sul|tan by the contrary Faction to the Vizier, who having the good fortune to have <HI>Kara Kaja</HI> his Friend then pre&s;ent when the Com|plaint was made; at which he ob&s;erving the Grand Seignior to grow very angry, imme|diately interpos'd in behalf of the Vizier, ex|cu&s;ing him as ignorant in the matter, and that none was guilty therein be&s;ides <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> the Vizier's <HI>Kaja,</HI> who was the &s;ole Actor and Contriver of the Offence. The Grand Seignior, who had always been con&s;tant to his prime Mini&s;ter, was willing to &s;ee him cover'd with &s;uch a &s;creen, and without far|ther delay Sign'd a Command to take off the head of the <HI>Kaja,</HI> which was di&s;patch'd away by the <HI>Salahor,</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Quer|ries</HI> belonging to the Stables. <HI>Kara Kaja</HI> a very bad Man, who was Friend to the Vi|zier, di&s;patch'd with all expedition this Ad|vice unto him; which he having receiv'd, and fearing left his <HI>Kaja</HI> &s;hould be carried away alive to the Grand Seignior, and be|tray the whole truth of their Combination, not &s;taying for the Command, immediately order'd him to be &s;trangled. It was early in the Morning when the Letter came, and at the &s;ame moment the Vizier &s;ent for <HI>Ali Aga,</HI> who had been <HI>Talki&s;hgee</HI> to the late Vizier, (that is the Officer who carries Me&s;&s;ages to the Grand Seignior) and then Agent at the Port for the <HI>Tartar Han,</HI> and bid him go to <HI>Ha&s;&s;an Kaja</HI> and take his Place. <HI>Ali Aga</HI> &s;urpriz'd and confus'd with this direction, went as he was order'd, and whil&s;t he was &s;peaking to <HI>Ha&s;&s;an,</HI> and telling him that he did not well un|der&s;tand the Vizier's Plea&s;ure, in came the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies with a Ve&s;t, with which (after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion) he Cloathed <HI>Ali Aga,</HI> bidding <HI>Ha&s;&s;an</HI> to retire into the inward Chamber; where being entred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Viziers <HI>Kaja</HI> &s;trangled.</NOTE> two lu&s;ty <HI>Arnouts,</HI> who were &s;el|ling Cimnels in the Streets, were brought up and order'd to &s;trangle him; the Cord was thrown down before him, which &s;eeming &s;tiff, and not prepar'd to &s;lip ea&s;ily, he de&s;ir'd his Executioners to make u&s;e of his own Girdle. But before he dy'd, he in&s;tantly urg'd that it might be permitted him to &s;ee the Vizier, to whom he had many things of Importance to Communi|cate. But it would not be granted; and as the Cord was putting about his neck, he Cur&s;ed the Vizier, &s;aying the&s;e la&s;t words; <HI>O Treacherous World, now I know thee!</HI> Be|ing a &s;trong Man he was long in dying; and &s;ome few hours after his Execution be|ing ob&s;erv'd to move, the Vizier order'd the Principal Gaoler to watch him until he was Enterr'd. And &s;o was the Grand Seignior's Sentence fore&s;tal'd, for he was in his Grave before that arriv'd.</P>
<P>After his death, the next thing was to ran&s;ack his Hou&s;es, where great Riches were found, both in Furniture, Clothing, Jewels, and Money; he had four hundred and twenty Hor&s;es in his Stables; to the <HI>Meri</HI> or Exchequer fifteen hundred Pur&s;es of his Money were brought, but his Hou|&s;es and Lands were a&s;&s;ign'd to pay his Debts, all which he had gain'd in the &s;pace of three years. In one of his new Hou&s;es he had enclo&s;ed forty thou&s;and <HI>Chequins</HI> within a Wall, which his Steward di&s;cover'd, and that he had murther'd the poor Ma&s;ons whom he had employ'd in the Work. When this Vizier was <HI>Chimacam,</HI> (as he was for &s;everal years) this Man was once his <HI>Kaja,</HI> but he was &s;o &s;hamele&s;s a Villain, that his Ma&s;ter drubb'd him, and turn'd him out of his Service. How&s;oever, being now Vizier, and knowing that he had need of &s;uch an In&s;trument, he took him again into the &s;ame Office; and calling to Mind that when he was <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Sili&s;tria,</HI> in the time of Old <HI>Kuperlee,</HI> he &s;av'd him&s;elf by cutting off another <HI>Kaja,</HI> he re&s;erv'd this Rogue for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The new <HI>Kaja</HI> was a much better Man, and therefore little confided in by the Vi|zier, and con&s;equently made no great Fi|gure at his Court; his Chief Confident now was the <HI>Reis-E&s;&s;endi,</HI> or Principal Secretary, by who&s;e hands all Treaties and Negotia|tions pa&s;s'd. In &s;hort, by the&s;e Arts and Means the Vizier kept up his Credit with his Ma&s;ter, and in de&s;pight of the Faction which was again&s;t him, he &s;tood firm on his Ba&s;is, &s;uch was the favour and con&s;tan|cy of the <HI>Sultan</HI> to his prime Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>On the twenty third of <HI>November, Caplan Pa&s;ha,</HI> who had for &s;ome years been <HI>Capitan Pa&s;ha,</HI> and of whom we have had occa&s;ion to make mention often in our former Hi&s;tory, died at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> being grown almo&s;t to a Dotage; he had ju&s;t &s;uch another <HI>Kaja</HI> as the Vizier had, who mi&s;erably pillag'd and oppre&s;s'd the poor I&s;landers in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> from whom he extorted two hundred Pur&s;es; &s;uch another Sum would totally have ruin'd them.</P>

<P>All this is a &s;hort Epitome of the Trou|bles and Unquietne&s;&s;es in <HI>Hungary,</HI> for the &s;pace of about Eighteen years, which having been the occa&s;ion of the great War, which hath alter'd the &s;tate of the whole World; We &s;hall not content over &s;elves with this &s;hort Relation, but &s;hall proceed to render an Account of the ri&s;e of the&s;e Troubles, the continuance of them, with the &s;everal Succe&s;&s;es, until the Entire conque&s;t of <HI>Hun|gary</HI> by the Emperor.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Hungary</HI> are naturally of a mutinous and unquit Temper, complaining of War, and not well contented with Peace. The Emperor towards the end of the Cam|paign 1664. had gain'd a Victory (as is &s;aid) over the <HI>Turks,</HI> and made the good u&s;e thereof, as with that opportunity to clap up a Peace. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> who be|fore that time, and even during the War with the <HI>Turk,</HI> bad been un&s;ea&s;onably incen|&s;ed by many In&s;ults and Outrages commit|ted on them by the <HI>German</HI> Soldiers; but more &s;en&s;ibly touched by having their Churches taken from them by the Coun&s;el, and advice of the Je&s;uits and Clergy of <HI>Rome;</HI> were not content with the Peace made by the Emperor with the Grand Seignior: Alledging that they ought to have been made Par|ties to the Treaty, it being their Country which was chiefly concern'd: That after &s;o Signal a Victory, better and more advantage|ous Articles might have been obtain'd from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Newhaw&s;el</HI> it &s;elf might have been Surrender'd and Re&s;tored, but by default hereof their Condition was render'd far wor&s;e than before, for by vertue of the new Articles lately concluded: The <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Newhaw&s;el</HI> pretended to bring all the Vil|lages on the Frontiers of <HI>Moravia</HI> under Con|tribution; and to add unto the new Con|que&s;ts all the Country and places on this &s;ide the <HI>Danube,</HI> which are nearly adjoyn|ing to <HI>Gran, Alba-Regalis</HI> and <HI>Kani&s;ia,</HI> where|in was comprehended the greate&s;t part of the lower <HI>Hungary:</HI> Which they exclaimed again&s;t as Terms &s;o di&s;agreeable unto them, that a War had been much better; and there|fore to prevent and di&s;appoint all farther pro|ceedings thereon, they &s;eized on the Secre|tary of the Imperial Re&s;ident then remaining with the Vizier, on the way as he was car|rying the Articles of Peace to be Ratify'd by the Emperor, and took from him his Hor&s;es and Money with his Di&s;patches, which they for &s;ome time detain'd, and re|&s;tored not without much difficulty.</P>
<P>The Emperor being inform'd of this Af|front, cited the Chief Lords of <HI>Hungary</HI> to appear at <HI>Vienna:</HI> Where the Prince <HI>Lukovitz</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Imperial Council told them, <HI>That the Conditions of Peace which his Ma|&s;ter the Emperor had concluded with the</HI> Turk, <HI>were not &s;o di&s;advantageous as they imagin'd; for that the fir&s;t overture of Peace came from the</HI> Turks <HI>them&s;elves, with whom it was a|greed and concluded, that</HI> Tran&s;ilvania <HI>was to continue in its ancient Liberty, and not &s;ub|jected to the Government of a</HI> Pa&s;ha <HI>in nature of a</HI> Mahometan <HI>Province. That the Counties of</HI> Zatmar <HI>and</HI> Zamboli&s;h, <HI>which were anci|ently e&s;teem'd dependencies on</HI> Tran&s;ilvania, <HI>were to be transferr'd into the power of the Emperor. That the better to &s;ecure the Fron|tiers of the upper</HI> Hungary, <HI>and to prevent the Incur&s;ions of the</HI> Turks <HI>on the other &s;ide of the</HI> Danube, <HI>It was provided in the Capi|tulations, that the Emperor might Build Forts on each &s;ide of the River</HI> Waagh; <HI>which would very much annoy and re&s;train the</HI> Turks <HI>of</HI> Waradin <HI>and</HI> Newhaw&s;el <HI>from making De|predations, or Incur&s;ions on that &s;ide of the Country. Now con&s;idering that this Peace was thus advantageous, as well to</HI> Hungary <HI>as to the Hereditary Dominions; his Imperial Maje&s;ty judged it convenient to embrace &s;o fair an opportunity; expecting that the</HI> Hun|garian <HI>Lords would likewi&s;e concur with him in Confirmation of the Treaty, and re&s;train their Soldiers from committing farther Out|rages on the Frontiers. That his Imperial Maje&s;ty as to his part, was re&s;olved to with|draw all his</HI> German <HI>Regiments out of</HI> Hun|gary; <HI>Provided, That they them&s;elves would take care to furni&s;h, and &s;upply tho&s;e Garri|&s;ons
<PB N="17" REF="15"> with Soldiers of their own, and at their own charge repair the Fortifications of</HI> Le|vents, Schentra, Neutra, Schella <HI>and</HI> Gutta, <HI>which are Neighbouring places to</HI> Newhaw&s;el, <HI>and to furni&s;h them with all &s;orts of Ammu|nition, and Provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for their Main|tenance and Defence.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarian</HI> Lords returned no pre|&s;ent an&s;wer to this Di&s;cour&s;e; having not Authority &s;o to do, until they had fir&s;t con|&s;ulted with the Nobility of the Upper <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> who had often prote&s;ted that they would never agree to any thing, which was concluded without their con&s;ent, and re|venge them&s;elves on their Palatine, in ca&s;e he &s;hould engage them in matters without their Privity or Concurrence fir&s;t ob|tain'd.</P>
<P>In fine, after Con&s;ultations had with the E&s;tates, an an&s;wer was giving in Writing to this effect. <HI>That to conclude a Peace without the Privity and Concurrence of the E&s;tates, was again&s;t the Statutes, and Privileges of the Kingdom. That in ca&s;e they could flatter them&s;elves &s;o far, as to believe that true Tranquillity and Ea&s;e would be the effect, and con&s;equence of the late Truce made with the</HI> Turk, <HI>which would be the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that could befal a Nation, (which above all the People in this World had been hara&s;&s;ed with War:) Yet it was difficult, and almo&s;t un|practicable for them to build the Fortre&s;&s;es in|tended upon the</HI> Waagh, <HI>and in the mean time re&s;train the</HI> Turks <HI>from their Incur&s;ions; and let them do what was po&s;&s;ible for them, yet &s;till</HI> Hungary <HI>would lie open, and expo&s;ed for at lea&s;t</HI> 60 <HI>Leagues &s;pace to the Incur&s;ions of the</HI> Turks, <HI>and to the extortions and in|&s;olences of the</HI> German <HI>Soldiers: In &s;hort therefore, they re&s;olved to Ratify nothing; they would neither exchange the Garri&s;ons nor Build new Forts, nor Repair old ones; but leave every thing to his Maje&s;ty to provide what was nece&s;&s;ary for the defence, and con|&s;ervation of that mi&s;erable and unfortunate Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>This memorial being given in with a kind of &s;ad and a di&s;contented behaviour, de|&s;pairing (as it were) of the welfare of their Country; the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were retiring from the Emperor and his Council, when the Prince <HI>Lubkovitz</HI> rea&s;&s;um'd in a calm and &s;ober manner his former Di&s;cour&s;e, which he pre&s;&s;ed on them with new and per&s;wa|&s;ive In&s;tances: Telling them, <HI>That he could not imagin upon what Grounds or Rea&s;ons they did de&s;ire a continuance of War, the Stage and Theater of which was to be their own Country. That out of a &s;ence of tho&s;e Mi&s;eries which were to en&s;ue, and from a pious and gracious regard he conceived for the repo&s;e of</HI> Hungary, <HI>the Emperor had concluded a Peace with the</HI> Turk, <HI>which he was contriving to &s;ecure again&s;t all violences and irruptions of the Enemy. And that entire &s;atisfaction might be given to the</HI> Hungarian <HI>Lords,</HI> his Imperial Maje&s;ty de|clar'd, <HI>That he would build tho&s;e Forts upon the</HI> Waagh, <HI>which were de&s;ign'd to re&s;train all Incur&s;ions from the Garri&s;on of</HI> Newhau&s;el,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em|peror's Grant to the <HI>Hun|garians.</HI></NOTE> <HI>at his own expence and charge: That he would withdraw the</HI> German <HI>Troops from burdening the Country, and quarter</HI> Hungarians <HI>in their places; That while&s;t the&s;e Forts were in Build|ing, the Guards thereunto belonging &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of</HI> Hu&s;&s;ars <HI>and</HI> Heydukes: <HI>That all places of Tru&s;t and Profit, both Civil and Military, &s;hould be put into the Hands of</HI> Hungarians. <HI>And that they might at their own will and plea&s;ure, put what Forces and Commanders they plea&s;ed into the Garri&s;ons of the</HI> Moun|tain Towns <HI>and other places.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions from the Emperor be|ing &s;o gracious and free, as nothing could be de&s;ir'd more ample and &s;atisfactory; the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Lords acquie&s;ced and &s;igned the Treaty with the <HI>Turks:</HI> So that all things began to put on a Face, and clear a&s;pect of Tranquillity and Repo&s;e, as well in refe|rence unto Foreign Wars, as to civil and in|te&s;tine differences: And thereupon the Crown, wherewith the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings were u&s;ually Crown'd, and which the Lords had removed from <HI>Presburg,</HI> to prevent the Emperor from taking it upon him with Right of Inheritance, was again return'd by them, and re&s;tor'd to its former place.</P>
<P>But the&s;e fair promi&s;es and a&s;&s;urances given by the Prince <HI>Lubkovitz</HI> in behalf of the Emperor, proceeded no farther than to words, for neither were their Churches re|&s;tor'd; Nor the <HI>German</HI> Forces recalled out of the Country; Nor the Towns of <HI>Ni|tria</HI> and <HI>Levents,</HI> lately taken from the <HI>Turks</HI> deliver'd into their Hands, as was promi&s;ed: But in&s;tead thereof, <HI>German</HI> Gar|ri&s;ons were put into <HI>Tokai, Zatmar, Kalo</HI> and <HI>Onod,</HI> Towns which are bordering on <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and were belonging to Prince <HI>Ragotski.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, nothing being perform'd as was promi&s;ed, the Spirits of the <HI>Hungarians</HI> were &s;o exa&s;perated, that they de&s;ponded of any good from the Imperial Court, but rather beheld it as a Cabal, contriving and medi|tating only to bring them under an Arbi|trary power, and an un&s;upportable Slavery. And this general Humour of di&s;content, &s;o &s;pread it &s;elf in the Minds of the People; that they grew Sullen, and Angry in an In&s;tant; and both the Roman Catholicks and Prote&s;tants, and all &s;orts of Religions in that Nation became &s;o concern'd for the Liberty and Privileges of their Country; that they freely and openly declar'd, <HI>That they would rather &s;ubject them&s;elves to the</HI> Turks, <HI>than become the Slaves of the</HI> Germans.</P>

The greate&s;t part of which Cen&s;ures will without doubt fall upon the Prote&s;tants, who&s;e Arms have wanted even Succe&s;s; that popular ju&s;tification, and who&s;e Cau&s;e labours under two &s;uch fearful appearances, as a defection from their Prince, and the joyning with the Common Enemy of Chri|&s;tendom, tho' perhaps a con&s;idering Man will be apt to reflect on that Cruel &s;everity, which forc'd them to take &s;helter in the Arms of an Infidel; at lea&s;t he will &s;ee a fatal in&s;tance, of the unhappy Con&s;equen|ces of driving Men to De&s;pair, by &s;ubver|ting their Laws, Liberties and Religion.

That what&s;oever <HI>Bethlem</HI> or <HI>Ragotski</HI> had done, this Liberty was not|with&s;tanding confirm'd by the Edicts and Ordinances of the Emperor: That if it had been &s;o, that Prote&s;tants, who being daily provok'd by the Papi&s;ts, had gone a little too far, yet the innocent ought not to &s;uffer.

The &s;econd Argument is, "That this liberty was not e&s;tabli&s;ht by the unanimous con&s;ent of the States of the Kingdom, to whom it belongs to make Laws with the Con&s;ent and Approba|tion of his Maje&s;ty, and con&s;equently that tho&s;e Articles ought to be aboli&s;ht.

Tho' the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Strigonium, George Lippai,</HI> and &s;ome &s;eculars oppo&s;ed it, yet Count <HI>Palfy</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Chamber, and divers Catholick Lords con&s;ented, not|with&s;tanding that oppo&s;ition; &s;o that the Affair, being extreamly hindred by that Arch-Bi&s;hop and his adherents, the Pro|te&s;tants were upon the point of complain|ing to his Maje&s;ty, had they not been &s;topt by the Declaration that was made, that they voluntarily &s;ub&s;cribed to the Articles of the Pacification of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which they called the Foundation of the Kingdom: So that this Edict of <HI>Lintz</HI> was ratify'd and in&s;erted in the Articles of the year 1647 with this Clau&s;e, Not|with&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the Clergy and other Seculars, which &s;hall have no force or vigour for the future. Be&s;ides the Sub&s;cription of the Pacification of <HI>Vienna,</HI> made by all the States both Eccle&s;ia&s;tick and Civil, runs thus: We underwritten do, with common con&s;ent, in the name of all the States and Orders of the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the places annex'd to it, promi&s;e freely and voluntarily, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> The third Argument was, <Q REND="margQuotes">That if the <HI>Luthe|rans</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> mu&s;t be tolerated, then tho&s;e only mu&s;t be tolerated, which are of the Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ausbourg,</HI> and the Confe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Swi&s;&s;es:</HI> But both one and the other had abandon'd tho&s;e Confe&s;&s;ions; and they in&s;tanced in &s;everal Articles from which they had de|viated.</Q> But this la&s;t &s;eems only a frivo|lous &s;hift, and &s;hews the Re&s;olution the Clergy had taken to oppre&s;s the Prote&s;tants; and indeed this they had always done, when they thought them&s;elves the &s;tron|ger, and notwith&s;tanding, that this Liberty was often confirm'd, as particularly in the Treaties with <HI>Botskai, Bethlem</HI> and Prince <HI>Ragotski;</HI> yet the Roman Catholick Lords and Gentlemen, and e&s;pecially the Arch-Bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, per&s;ecuted them with Fire and Sword, ma&s;&s;acr'd them in their Churches; and u&s;ed all manner of Cruel|ties towards them, as far as their Power and Authority could reach; &s;o that there remain'd &s;carce any place of Re&s;t, or Secu|rity for the Prote&s;tants, but in the free Cities, and tho&s;e too quickly after were in|volved in the &s;ame misfortune: For <HI>Nada&s;ti, Serini, Frangipani,</HI> and other Catholick Lords taking part with Prince <HI>Ragotski</HI> a|gain&s;t the Emperor, in the year 1670. the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Troops entr'd <HI>Hungary</HI> and carried all before them, and with them Troops of Bi&s;hops, Arch-Bi&s;hops and Je|&s;uits, who&s;e Actions out-did the Fury of the Soldiers; and took this opportunity of di&s;poiling the Prote&s;tants of their Goods, Churches, Mini&s;ters, and con&s;train'd a great part of the People to change their Religi|on: The Prote&s;tant Lords were tax'd at im|men&s;e Sums, Soldiers quarter'd upon them, and by the&s;e means &s;everal forc'd to turn Catholicks. In &s;hort, all Upper and Lower <HI>Hungary</HI> with all the Free Towns, fell in|to the Hands of the Catholicks, who&s;e Se|verities and Cruelties, as they found no|thing to oppo&s;e them, &s;o they &s;uffer'd no|thing to e&s;cape them: And this mi&s;erable Kingdom labour'd at once under the Li|cence and Rapine of the <HI>German</HI> Soldiers, and the Rage and Fury of the Je&s;uitical Con|verters. The Prote&s;tants were hang'd up at their Church Gates, and &s;everal of their Towns burnt. One <HI>John Backi</HI> a Mini&s;ter, was burnt a live at <HI>Comarin,</HI> and the Wi|dow of <HI>Laurent le Sur,</HI> who was of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion, had her Head cut off in the &s;ame Town: And multitudes of both Sexes, and all Ages and Conditions were bani&s;h'd.&mdash;To Authorize the&s;e Cruelties, at lea&s;t to give them a fair glo&s;s, they con|&s;tituted a Chamber of Ju&s;tices at <HI>Po&s;on,</HI> compos'd of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and Seculars, all &s;worn Enemies to the Prote&s;tants; where

<P>But the greate&s;t Storm fell upon the Mi|ni&s;ters, at whom they chiefly aim'd; and that they might get rid of them the better, they e&s;tabli&s;h'd three Courts of Judicature: One at <HI>Tirnavia</HI> for tho&s;e of <HI>Po&s;on,</HI> and two at <HI>Po&s;on</HI> for the re&s;t of <HI>Hungary:</HI> Nor were they all cited for fear of making too much noi&s;e, but a few and tho&s;e of the <HI>Ausbourg</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion, to try what &s;ucce&s;s they were like to expect from the Pro&s;ecu|tion of the re&s;t: And, becau&s;e they chiefly de&s;ign'd to ruin the Prote&s;tant Religion, under pretence of Rebellion, they pre|&s;ented tho&s;e that appear'd the&s;e following Articles to &s;ign. 1&s;t, <Q REND="margQuotes">That all the Mini|&s;ters of both Confe&s;&s;ions, School-Ma&s;ters, Readers, Students, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to e&s;cape the Pu|ni&s;hments which they had incurred for their Rebellion, &s;hould promi&s;e under their Hands to renounce all their Functions both publick and private, and pa&s;s the re&s;t of their Lives peaceably and quietly, upon pain of Death if they di&s;obey'd.</Q> Or 2ly, <Q REND="margQuotes">That they &s;hould be bani&s;h'd for ever, with promi&s;e never to return to their Country, or to any of the Heredi|tary Lands, or other dependencies on the Empire, nor yet to go over to their Enemies.

<P>The 25th of <HI>September</HI> 1673.

This lucky beginning encourag'd them to proceed, and finding fear to be the &s;tronge&s;t motive to work upon them; they cited all the Mini|&s;ters, Regents, School-Ma&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of <HI>Hun|gary</HI> to appear before them, which cau&s;ed a &s;trange con&s;ternation among&s;t them, and produced very different effects; &s;ome of them the Nobility would not &s;uffer to ap|pear, others fled, &s;ome again abandoned them&s;elves to the care of Providence, made their appearance at <HI>Po&s;on,</HI> to ju&s;tifie their Innocence from the&s;e horrible Calum|nies, with which they were blackn'd, to te&s;tifie their obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Magi&s;trate, and to &s;atisfie their Churches, who earne&s;tly begg'd of them not to for&s;ake them in that calamitous Condition. There were 250 Mini&s;ters that appear'd, and by their Tryals (two long to repeat) it appears, That their Religion was the chief Crime, and tho' other things were laid to their Charge; yet all was but pretence; they u&s;ed all means to intimidate them, and to &s;hake that great con&s;tancy which they &s;hew'd for their Religion; they &s;entenced them to death, impri&s;oned them, threatned them with the Gallies, and employ'd all the pernicious arts of torment and vexation, that a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit could contrive, to &s;hake or &s;urprize the Frailty of Man; drag|ged them into their Churches, forced them upon their Knees to adore the Ho&s;t and their Images, let loo&s;e the fury of the Sol|diery upon them, and encouraged them to torment them; in the mid&s;t of this barbar|ous u&s;age, they would &s;ometimes pretend to &s;hew a glimp&s;e of Pity, and endeavour to allure them by the promi&s;es of the Im|perial favour and protection, offering them preferments, upon Condition they would change their Religion; at length finding them proof again&s;t all their arts, they &s;tig|matiz'd &s;everal and &s;old them to the Spa|ni&s;h Gallies, from whence afterwards they were redeem'd by the famous <HI>Ruyter,</HI> Admi|ral of <HI>Holland;</HI> others were thrown into vile, loath&s;ome Pri&s;ons in which &s;ome peri&s;h'd, the re&s;t who out-lived their misfortunes, were relea&s;ed by the importunities of the States Amba&s;&s;ador at the Imperial Court. The&s;e matters of fact are too publick to be denied, and the Rea&s;ons that are given, &s;eem by no means &s;ufficient to palliate &s;uch Barbarities. Tho&s;e Letters in Cypher which were produc'd again&s;t them, to prove them Guilty of Trea&s;on are ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pe|cted; but grant them true, they were but from particulars, and one or two Mens Guilt cannot render a whole body of Men liable to puni&s;hment. As for tho&s;e Accu|&s;ations which were laid upon them of be|ing Murderers, Robbers, Ravi&s;hers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they were only alledged, not proved, and con&s;equently likely to be meer Calumnies.

<P>And from this Original began that War, which hath ever &s;ince continued with great effu&s;ion of Blood, and &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of Fortune; which not only reduced <HI>Hungary</HI> to the pit of de&s;pair, but even <HI>Germany</HI> it &s;elf to the brink of De&s;truction; until God was pleas'd to take the Cau&s;e into his own Hands, and avenge Chri&s;tendom from their Enemies, who&s;e Sins (it &s;eems) were more ripe for the Divine vengeance, than tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tian people.

Hence it was, That the Prote&s;tants cho&s;e three Leaders, or Chiefs of their Faction and Party; again&s;t which Prince <HI>Ragotski,</HI> and <HI>Apafi</HI> oppo&s;ed their Forces in favour of the Palatine <HI>We&s;&s;elini;</HI> <MILESTONE N="1666"> and Count <HI>Palaffi Imbre</HI> appear'd as one of the Chief of the <HI>Male-contents;</HI> but having not &s;ufficient Force to &s;u&s;tain his party and intere&s;t, he crav'd a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;uccour from the <HI>Turks,</HI> to whom he offer'd his Son for a Ho&s;tage, and the Town of <HI>Debin,</HI> with the dependences thereunto belonging, as a farther &s;ecurity for performance of Articles.</P>
<P>All was now divided into Sects and Par|ties: Count <HI>Peter Serini,</HI> of whom the Em|peror had not the lea&s;t jealou&s;ie, entertain|ed &s;ecret con&s;ults with the <HI>Malecontents;</HI> and with <HI>Nada&s;ti</HI> rai&s;ed Forces upon pre|tence of giving a &s;top to the <HI>Turks,</HI> in their pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> but with real de&s;ign to &s;eize the Per&s;on of the Emperor at <HI>Put|tendorf,</HI> a place appertaining to Count <HI>Na|da&s;ti;</HI> as he was Riding po&s;t with Prince <HI>Lubkovitz,</HI> Chief Steward of his Hou&s;e, and with about 12 Gentlemen of his Reti|nue to meet the Empre&s;s; but that Plot took not effect, for their Ambu&s;cade mi&s;|&s;ing the Emperor, he happily met the Em|pre&s;s on her Journey out of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Malecontents, who thought the&s;e Propo&s;als very hard, did yet endeavour to come as near an ac|cord as was po&s;&s;ible; for tho they were un|willing to &s;urrender up their own Towns and Deme&s;nes to the <HI>Turks,</HI> yet they pro|mis'd to fight for them, and deliver &s;uch Towns and Fortre&s;&s;es as they &s;hould take from the Emperor into their hands.</P>

<P>During all this time the Imperial Court had only &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies of what was Plotting, rather than any certain ad|vice
<PB N="24" REF="19"> or knowledge thereof. And the Em|perour's Re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tan&s;tinople</HI> had as yet received but &s;ome ob&s;cure Notions, of what was treating by the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanian</HI> Agents, which afterwards came to a clearer Light, by the means of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|man as we have before declar'd in our pre|ceding Hi&s;tory: And which being once made known, other things appear'd to put the matter out of all doubt or que&s;tion. And as a particular Evidence to di&s;cover this Truth; the principal Servant of Count <HI>Ta&s;&s;embach,</HI> and one in whom he had repo|&s;ed the greate&s;t confidence, having been put in Pri&s;on by him for Robbing him; this Traitor that he might be revenged on the Count and obtain his Liberty, di&s;covered much of the Plot, by producing one of the original Papers, all written with the proper Hand of <HI>Ta&s;&s;embach,</HI> which contain'd a Scheme of the whole method of their in|tended proceedings, as agreed and concer|ted between him and Count <HI>Serini,</HI> dated the 11th of <HI>September</HI> 1667. This Paper be|ing Read in the Council at <HI>Vienna,</HI> &s;erved to open the Eyes of the Emperor, and of the Government, and cau&s;ed them to watch all the motions of <HI>Ta&s;&s;embach,</HI> and of <HI>Serini</HI> and the other Accomplices.</P>
<P>To evidence and farther confirm that there was a Plot, advices came from <HI>Scha|ketorno</HI> in <HI>Croatia,</HI> that Count <HI>Serini</HI> was in Arms and had levied &s;everal Troops.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plot di&s;|covered.</NOTE> The original Letter al&s;o appeared which <HI>Serini</HI> wrote to <HI>Frangipani,</HI> giving him an account of the Re&s;olutions and Proceedings of <HI>Ta&s;|&s;embach;</HI> the which Letter (by what means is not known) was found with a Soldier belonging to <HI>Frangipani,</HI> who carele&s;ly made u&s;e of it, for a &s;topper to his Powder-horn: Another Letter was intercepted from <HI>Fran|gipani,</HI> directed to one of his Captains in whom he repo&s;ed his greate&s;t confidence: <HI>Signifying the offers which he had made to the</HI> Turks <HI>of &s;ubjection to them; that the</HI> Ger|mans <HI>intended nothing more than to ruin their Country; and therefore, that he &s;hould keep his Forces in a readine&s;s to oppo&s;e them in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;everal other Evidences were a clear conviction of a Plot de&s;ign'd; and a ground &s;ufficient for the Pre&s;ident of the Council of <HI>Grats,</HI> to &s;eize the Per&s;on of Count <HI>Ta&s;&s;embach,</HI> and commit him to &s;afe Cu&s;tody. After which his Hou&s;e was &s;earch|ed, where was found a con&s;iderable quanti|ty of Powder and Ammunition: And his Papers being al&s;o &s;eized and examined, it thereby appeared, that the Arms and Ammu|nition were de&s;igned to furni&s;h therewith 6000 Men, which he intended to rai&s;e: and upon farther enquiry into this matter, &s;everal que&s;tions being put to him; <HI>Ta&s;&s;em|bach</HI> own'd the whole De&s;ign and Con&s;pira|cy, and the Engagements which were be|tween him and the Count <HI>Serini.</HI> Whereof Copies with the Proce&s;s being &s;ent to the Emperor, the whole Plot was di&s;cover'd, and no further doubt or que&s;tion made of a Rebellion, and General revolt of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery was &s;econded by advices of the con&s;tant intercour&s;e and corre&s;pon|dences held between <HI>Serini,</HI> and the <HI>Pa&s;ha's</HI> of <HI>Buda, Bo&s;na</HI> and <HI>Kani&s;ia:</HI> And more particularly by a Letter, which Marquis <HI>Frangipani</HI> Brother-in-Law to Count <HI>Serini</HI> wrote to Captain <HI>T&s;colnits,</HI> containing the whole &s;ecret of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;erved to demon&s;trate the inveterane Malice, which the Marquis had conceived again&s;t the Em|peror, and the whole <HI>German</HI> Nation. <HI>T&s;col|nits,</HI> had at fir&s;t entertained a corre&s;pon|dence with the <HI>Malecontents,</HI> but making re|flections afterwards on the per&s;ons, with whom he was to engage; that they were ra&s;h and heady, and Men of no &s;olid Foun|dation or good Temper, he retracted from his former Engagements, and &s;how'd the Letter to the Emperor.</P>
<P>But matters were proceeded too far, to be wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or defeated: For tho&s;e in the upper <HI>Hungary</HI> appeared openly in the Field under <HI>Ragotski,</HI> who threatned to take <HI>Mongatz,</HI> where his Mother held her Court of Re&s;idence, and to &s;eize on the Trea|&s;ure, <MILESTONE N="1670"> which his Father had ama&s;&s;ed during the time, that he was Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania.</HI></P>
<P>The time being come in which the <HI>Male-contents</HI> had appointed to draw their Forces into the Field, on pretence of enterpri&s;ing &s;omething again&s;t the <HI>Turks:</HI> For we mu&s;t note, that in times of Peace, it is allow|able for both &s;ides either <HI>Turks,</HI> or Chri|&s;tians to make Incur&s;ions upon each other, to Rob and drive away Cattle, and to fight in the Field with &s;trong Parties both of Hor&s;e and Foot, provided that the numbers of them do not exceed 5000, and that no Cannon be brought into the Camp. <HI>Such is the mi&s;erable Condition of that unfortunate Kingdom:</HI> The <HI>Malecontents,</HI> I &s;ay, having with this pretence drawn their Forces into the Field; convened a Diet at <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Diet at <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia.</HI></NOTE> with|out out the knowledge or authority of the Em|peror; where the Nobility and the Deputies of the &s;everal Towns, and Cities in the lower <HI>Hungary</HI> were A&s;&s;embled; to the end, that they might have an under&s;tanding toge|ther, how to rai&s;e Money, and how to manage the War.</P>
<P>The Emperor, tho' not ignorant of all the&s;e Motions and Con&s;ults; yet wanting a &s;ufficient force to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e fir&s;t begin|nings of Rebellion, thought fit to tempo|rize and u&s;e Lenity for a while; tho' in the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Sta|remberg</HI> Impri&s;on|ed.</NOTE><HI>Ragotski,</HI> who thought it now time to ca&s;t off his Di&s;gui&s;e, invited Count <HI>Starem|berg</HI> to Dinner, and in the mean time in|ve&s;ted the City of <HI>Tokai,</HI> of which he was the Governour, with 8000 <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars;</HI> but the place was &s;o well defended by the watch|fulne&s;s and valour of the Lieutenant Govern|our, that his Men were repul&s;ed with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Nor was he more pro|&s;perous in his attempt upon <HI>Mongatz,</HI> which, at the news of his approach, was defended by his Mother, who cau&s;ed the Bridges to be drawn and the Cannon levelled again&s;t him, preferring the Loyalty towards her Prince before the natural tenderne&s;s to a Son, to whom &s;he &s;ent tho&s;e Reproaches of his Treachery, as became a Lady of that great and generous Vertue.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Malecontents</HI> in de|&s;pight of the Emperor held their Meeting, <MILESTONE N="1670"> which they called a Diet at <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Male|contents of|fer their aggrievan|ces to the Emperor.</NOTE> and having concerted all their matters, and a|greed on a Scheme of their Affairs, they drew up a Remon&s;trance of their chief Aggrievances, which they offered to his Im|perial Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring that the Churches taken from the Prote&s;tants might again be re&s;tor'd to them: That all their Towns and Fortre&s;&s;es might be freed and ea&s;ed of <HI>German</HI> Soldiers, and that in place of them, their Garri&s;ons might be &s;upplied with <HI>Hun|garians:</HI> And La&s;tly, That they might have liberty to make War on the <HI>Turks,</HI> with their own Men, and at their own expence. The&s;e Propo&s;itions were rejected by the Emperor at the in&s;tigation of his Chief Officers and Mini&s;ters of State, who &s;wallowing in their de&s;ires all the Riches and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> hoped to force them into a Rebellion, by which their Lands and E&s;tates might be forfeited to the Emperor, that they might beg them for their own benefit and enjoyment.</P>
<P>The Emperor communicated all the&s;e matters to the Diet at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> giving them to under&s;tand how nece&s;&s;ary it was to &s;up|pre&s;s the&s;e Di&s;turbances and In&s;urrections in their beginnings: And immediately before he &s;ent his Forces into the upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> he thought fit to cau&s;e Major General <HI>Span|kau</HI> to March into <HI>Croatia</HI> again&s;t <HI>Serini</HI> with 6000 Men. Upon the news of the approach of the&s;e Forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sereni <HI>un|re&s;olved.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Serini</HI> was greatly &s;urprized, and in &s;uch a con&s;ternation that he knew not what to re&s;olve.

The <HI>Valachians</HI> had likewi&s;e de&s;erted him, and adhered to Count <HI>Herber&s;tein</HI> Govern|our of <HI>Carol&s;tadt.</HI> Nor was the time as yet come, that the <HI>Malecontents</HI> had appointed to &s;tir in the upper <HI>Hungary;</HI> in the mean time his own Forces were weak and incon|&s;iderable, not exceeding 2000 <HI>Morlaques</HI> in his City of <HI>Chiacatorno,</HI> and tho&s;e ill pro|vided either with Money, Ammunition or Vi|ctuals to maintain a Seige.

And farther, this Prince, to demon&s;trate his concernment and re&s;pect to this Family (of which he was a Member) offer'd out of his own E&s;tate to pay the Debts thereof, which amounted to 400000 Florins, and for ever to e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of <HI>Serini,</HI> and of tho&s;e related to him.

But this Count not being able to obtain other than ambiguous and general An&s;wers from the Emperors Council, it was not thought &s;afe for <HI>Ragot|ski</HI> to rely on tho&s;e terms and methods which had before fail'd in the Ca&s;es of <HI>Se|rini</HI> and <HI>Frangipani.</HI> And therefore the Prince&s;s his Mother, to play a &s;urer Game, and to take off all jealou&s;ie, engaged, in the name of her Son, that he &s;hould receive into all places of his jurisdiction &s;uch Gar|ri&s;ons as the Emperor &s;hould plea&s;e to im|po&s;e upon him, and maintain them at his own Charge.</P>
<P>Thus did the Troubles of <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;eem to incline towards a Compo&s;ure, caus'd in|deed by the evil directions of the Empe|ror's Council, who to introduce an Arbi|trary Power into a Free Kingdom, and to make that Crown Hereditary which was Originally Elective, and to force a Reli|gion on them contrary to their Principles, and Con&s;ciences, had taken away their Churches and places where they a&s;&s;embled to &s;erve God, and compell'd them to re|ceive <HI>German</HI> and Foreign Garri&s;ons into all places and Fortre&s;&s;es of &s;trength within that Kingdom. <MILESTONE N="1670"> So that if any thing may be &s;aid in defence and excu&s;e for a People who rebel again&s;t their Prince, certainly the <HI>Hungarians</HI> had all tho&s;e Arguments which might be deduced from the Topicks of Law, Natural Liberty, and Self-pre&s;erva|tion to plead for them.</P>

The time appear'd favourable and advantageous to their enterpri&s;e, for the Walls of mo&s;t of the Towns were then beaten down, and the old Works &s;lighted, with de&s;ign to Rebuild, and make them &s;tronger according to the new way and manner of Fortifications.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time cho&s;en for the War.</NOTE> Provi&s;ions were al&s;o wanting in mo&s;t of the Garri&s;ons, and the <HI>German,</HI> as well as the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Troops were in Mutiny for want of pay.

<P>After this Defeat, <MILESTONE N="1673"> the Malecontents march|ed by the way of <HI>Serentz,</HI> about two Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Tokai,</HI> and inve&s;ted <HI>Zatmar;</HI> but a Sally being made out of the Town by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Staremberg,</HI> who Commanded there in Chief, they were for|ced to rai&s;e their Siege, with the lo&s;s of &s;everal Colours and many Pri&s;oners: Like|wi&s;e General <HI>Kops</HI> and <HI>Spankau</HI> pur&s;ued them &s;o clo&s;ely at the Heels, that with great lo&s;s and difficulty they were enforced to pa&s;s the <HI>They&s;s.</HI> Divers places at the &s;ame time &s;urrender'd, as the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Meges,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Nagibania,</HI> the which places were di&s;mantled, and their Walls thrown down: And as the Imperiali&s;ts were towards the end of the year, returning to their Winter quarters, they met a party of 500 Hor&s;e belonging to the Malecontented party, of which they killed 300 on the place, and took divers Pri&s;oners, one of

<P>Thus whil'&s;t it went ill in all places with the Malecontents, the Popi&s;h Clergy took courage to a&s;&s;ert their right to divers Churches and Chapels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Roman Clergy &s;eize on the Prote&s;tant Churches.</NOTE> which they pre|tended to belong unto them, and to tho&s;e of their Religion, and by force of Arms took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, which they held until &s;uch time, <MILESTONE N="1673"> as that the Prote&s;tant par|ty became &s;trong enough to eject them, and executed this de&s;ign without much oppo&s;ition in all the Counties of <HI>Nitria, Tren&s;chin, Turoz, Stranian, Lippovia,</HI> and in &s;everal Towns and Villages of the Moun|tains; where they &s;et up and exerci&s;ed the Popi&s;h Religion, with all the Rites and Ceremonies, to the great Scandal and Di&s;|plea&s;ure of the <HI>Hungarians.</HI> Particularly in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> at a Town called <HI>Senetz,</HI> the Curate of the Pari&s;h was zealous to celebrate in a publick, and &s;olemn man|ner the Fe&s;tival of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bloody Outrage committed.</NOTE> and to carry the Sacrament in Proce&s;&s;ion: Which Fea&s;t happening to be on a day, when a Fair was held at that Town, which brought a great concour&s;e of People thither, the Prie&s;t fearing &s;ome affront from the Multi|tude, de&s;ired the Governour of <HI>Branitz</HI> to afford him a Serjeant and 12 Soldiers to accompany the Sacrament, and defend it from the violence and prophanene&s;s of the Hereticks. Which being granted, as the Prie&s;t was carrying the Sacrament in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion, he was a&s;&s;aulted by the People, and killed by them, together with the 12 Soldiers which were &s;ent for his Guard. So &s;oon as Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> had news of this Sacrilegious Murder, he marched to the Town with his own Regiment, and &s;eve|ral Troops of <HI>German</HI> Hor&s;e, for puni&s;hment of the Authors of this abominable wicked|ne&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is re|venged.</NOTE> which he executed with all the Rigour and Severity imaginable; for he pillaged and burned their Hou&s;es, and put every one to the Sword, excepting tho&s;e who &s;aved their Lives by e&s;caping into the Woods.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e Defeats and many others given to the Malecontents, and this va&s;t effu&s;ion of Blood, it might well be imagin'd, that an end would have been put to this War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ob&s;ti|nacy of the Malecon|tents.</NOTE> which had neither a &s;etled Council, nor a Fund of Money, nor an Intere&s;t of great Men to &s;upport it. How&s;oever, &s;uch was the force and power, which the Preach|ers u&s;ed in their Sermons to the People, inciting them to a Defence of their Religion, the Exerci&s;e of which the Emperor (as they &s;aid) had determined to take from them, that they re&s;olved to die in the main|tenance thereof; being per&s;waded that their Friends and Companions, who had already &s;acrificed their Lives in that Cau&s;e, were real Martyrs, and had obtained the Crown which was laid up in Heaven for them. Nor were the Prote&s;tants only in the mind to Wage a War, but even the Roman Ca|tholicks al&s;o, who being moved by another Principle of defending the Privileges and Freedom of their People, thought it their Duty to ri&s;e up and a&s;&s;ert the Cau&s;e of their native Country and Nation. For tho' they owned all Duty and Obedience to the Emperor, yet being but an Elective King, and one to whom the People had &s;worn Allegiance on Condition that he &s;hould main|tain them in the ancient Rights, and Pri|leges of that Kingdom, they held them|&s;elves no longer obliged thereunto, after he had violated all their Laws, and ab&s;olutely &s;ubverted the ancient Fabrick of their Go|vernment, which he had apparently done in three in&s;tances. Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aggrie|vances of the <HI>Hunga|rians.</HI></NOTE> In quartering <HI>Ger|man</HI> Soldiers in the Country and Towns, with intent to over-awe and govern them by an ab&s;olute and an arbitrary Power.

And Thirdly, In&s;tead of &s;uch a Diet the Empe|ror was plea&s;ed to erect a Sovereign Coun|cil con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch Members, as he him|&s;elf did think fit to nominate and appoint, over which the Vice-King was as Chief Commi&s;&s;ioner to pre&s;ide. And thus the Parties of both Religions being di&s;gu&s;ted and animated to Fight <HI>pro Aris &amp; Focis,</HI> for their Laws, their Country and Religion; Fury and De&s;pair &s;erved them in the place of Coun&s;el, Money, and other Nerves and Sinews of War: So that when one party was cut off, another aro&s;e in greater num|bers, and like <HI>Hydra's</HI> increa&s;ed the more by being de&s;troyed.</P>

How&s;oever Colonel <HI>Jo|&s;ua</HI> remain'd firm and fix'd to his point; and upon a Pardon granted to him in am|ple form and manner, he took a New Oath of Fidelity to the Emperor, and engag'd his own Troops to follow him in his Du|tiful Allegiance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. <HI>Jo&s;ua</HI> gives Te&s;ti|monies of his Loyalty</NOTE> and that he might give &s;ome undoubted Te&s;timonies of his true Conver&s;ion, by &s;ome Acts of Loyalty and Bravery, he per&s;waded <HI>Semey</HI> the Gover|nour of <HI>Tourna</HI> to Surrender up the Ca&s;tle, and adhere unto the Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t of the Emperor.

<P>Nor did the Pe&s;tilence only Rage within the Emperor's Dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plague at <HI>New|haw&s;el.</HI></NOTE> but the Infection di&s;per&s;ed it &s;elf with &s;uch violence and rage within the Territories of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that five hundred Families fled out of <HI>New|haw&s;el,</HI> to breath in a more free and health|ful Air; but &s;carce were they remov'd a League from the Garri&s;on, before they were &s;urpriz'd by a party of five hundred <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Heydukes,</HI> who kill'd &s;ome of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The People for&s;ake the Town, and are cut off.</NOTE> and pillag'd and robbed the others of all the Goods and Monies which remain'd to them for a poor &s;upport, and maintenance of Life.

<P>And yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e daily pro|vocations given the <HI>Turk</HI> (I know not by what Fate) the Emperor was of Opinion, that it was &s;till po&s;&s;ible &s;o to &s;alve up Mat|ters with the Grand Seignior, that a War might be avoided.

<HEAD><HI>THE GRIEVANCES</HI> Of the two Imperial and Free Cities of &V;pper <HI>Hungary, Ca&s;|&s;ovia,</HI> and <HI>Epperies;</HI> wherein are Contain'd the Injuries done to all the Prote&s;tant Citizens and Inhabitants of the three Ranks, as well in their Civil Liberties, again&s;t the 25th, 26th, and 41&s;t Articles of the Diet of <HI>Sopron,</HI> An. <HI>1681.</HI> together with their Demands.</HEAD>
<P> <MILESTONE N="1681"> FIRST, It mu&s;t be allow'd that in the 26th Article of that Diet, by the Special Favour of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty, 'twas ex|pre&s;ly Ordain'd in the&s;e very Words: <HI>But in other parts 'tis Order'd ac|cording to His Maje&s;ty's Gracious Re&s;olution that Places be appointed for the Building of Churches and Schools, and Erecting Pa|ri&s;hes for the Conveniency of tho&s;e of the</HI> Helvetian <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion, and of that of</HI> Ausbourg.</P>
<P>That in&s;tead of the Churches, Schools, and Pari&s;hes taken from the Prote&s;tants, there &s;hould be A&s;&s;ign'd them by Commi&s;|&s;ioners appointed from His Maje&s;ty, com|modious and convenient Places, and that without any Re&s;triction, even in the Ci|ties of upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> according to the literal and genuine &s;en&s;e of the Clau&s;e of the &s;aid Article, which &s;aith, <HI>Furthermore in the Free and Mountain Cities, as al&s;o in all the Cities of upper</HI> Hungary <HI>are Places to be allow'd for the Building of Churches and Schools, and Erecting Pari&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s in the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> in the year 1687. His Maje&s;ty's High-Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed with &s;o much Clemency in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> were &s;o far in their proceedings from &s;atisfying either His Maje&s;ty's pious Re&s;olution, or the true and clear intent of the Article, that even in contempt of them all, and in com|pliance with their own fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es, they did a&s;&s;ign to the Prote&s;tants inconvenient and undecent places without the &s;aid Ci|ties, which have no Suburbs, and con&s;e|quently very remote in the Fields, to the evident exterminating of the free Exerci&s;e of our Religion from the &s;aid Cities.</P>
<P>Wherefore we do con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;t on the mo&s;t Holy Re&s;olution of His Maje&s;ty, as it is declar'd in the expre&s;s'd words of the Article before alledg'd, and by vertue thereof, do humbly implore, that in&s;tead of the inconvenient appointed Places &s;uch others (as &s;hall be both commodious and free from all Civil Taxes or Contributions, according to the intention of the 8th Ar|ticle, <HI>An.</HI> 1647. and the 12th, <HI>An.</HI> 1649. in the above-mentioned Cities, and within the Walls of the &s;ame, without any Am|biguity, &s;ince the before-cited 26th Article includeth the inward, not the outward parts of the Cities) be granted and a&s;|&s;ign'd to us the true and lawful Citizens, and in no wi&s;e de&s;erving &s;o unju&s;t a Ba|ni&s;hment from the mid&s;t of the Cities.</P>
<P>Secondly, 'tis al&s;o undeniable, that in the 25th Article, immediately foregoing, the Gracious Re&s;olution of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty is declar'd in the&s;e very words: <HI>To all and every one through the Kingdom (no Prote&s;tant Inhabitant of what&s;oever State and Condition, or in whatever part of the Kingdom excepted) according to the</HI> 1&s;t <HI>Article in the year</HI> 1608. <HI>publi&s;hed be|fore the Coronation, a free Exerci&s;e of their Religion in general is granted, and al&s;o that none of the &s;aid Inhabitants &s;hall any wi&s;e be di&s;turbed for the future in the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion, on the &s;evere puni&s;hment that is expre&s;ly &s;et down in the</HI> 26th <HI>Arti|cle of the Diet of</HI> Sopron.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, when the &s;aid Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> and <HI>Epperies</HI> would have freely us'd and enjoy'd their Right E&s;tabli&s;h'd by His Maje&s;ty's Warrant, and continu'd their way of Wor&s;hip, as al&s;o the In&s;truction of their Youth within the &s;aid Cities, and their Walls (as places provided by the above-mention'd Articles, and formerly us'd and allow'd) they were not only not admitted, but &s;everely prohi|bited and hindred by the Magi&s;trates and Clergy of the&s;e Cities, nay &s;ent away and
<PB N="66" REF="42"> Bani&s;h'd till this time, to the fore-&s;pecified places in no wi&s;e convenient for them, as if they were Strangers and wholly incapa|ble of the Common Liberties of the King|dom.</P>
<P>Wherefore in this Point al&s;o Relying on the Gracious Re&s;olution of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty, and the Articles he has been plea&s;ed to make with us, We do mo&s;t Humbly implore a lawful Re&s;titution and firm E&s;tabli&s;hment of the free exerci&s;e of our Religion in its former State, according to the &s;aid Article 1&s;t <HI>Anno</HI> 1608 <HI>(viz.)</HI> within the Walls of the &s;aid Cities. We al&s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively beg, that till we have a con|venient opportunity of Building and Ere|cting new Churches, Schools and Pari&s;hes (which by rea&s;on of our great Poverty, and the va&s;t Taxes and Contributions to the pre&s;ent War, we are not able now to perform) it be graciou&s;ly granted to us, that we may anew freely enjoy the &s;aid exerci&s;e of Religion in certain private and convenient places, and have Schools for the In&s;truction of Youth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Though the indifferent and common life of Bells and Burials was every where permitted, as well to the Prote&s;tants as Catholicks by the&s;e expre&s;s words, of the 26th Article of the Diet of <HI>Sopron: The free u&s;e of Bells and Burials is left to the Catholicks of tho&s;e places, as well as to tho&s;e of the</HI> Helvetian <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion, and of that of</HI> Ausbourg.</P>
<P>Which neverthele&s;s, the Catholick Magi&s;tracy and Clergy of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> and <HI>Epperies</HI> have fully deny'd, and do &s;till deny the &s;aid free u&s;e of Bells and Burials to the Prote&s;tant Inhabitants of the &s;aid Cities, forbidding them with mo&s;t &s;evere Threats, to perform the u&s;ual Ceremonies of Burials, within the Walls of the &s;aid Cities; notwith&s;tanding the gracious re&s;o|lution of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty, made to the illu&s;trious States of the Kingdom, in the Diet of <HI>Sopron, December</HI> the 10th, <HI>Anno</HI> 1681.</P>
<P>So that we earne&s;tly de&s;ire the common u&s;e of Bells and Burials for the Prote&s;tants, as well within, as without the City Walls, free from any mole&s;tation or di&s;turbance, conformable to the Pious Grant of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It is evident al&s;o, that by Ver|tue of the general Clau&s;e in&s;erted in the end of the &s;o often mention'd 26th Article in the&s;e words: <HI>Provided always, That the Laws of the Kingdom confirm'd by the Royal Charter be not hereby prejudiced.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tanding Laws of the Kingdom con|cerning the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenues of tho&s;e of the <HI>Helvetian</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion, and of that of <HI>Ausbourg</HI> were left in force, and con&s;e|quently any Arbitrary proceedings forbid|den, e&s;pecially &s;uch as again&s;t the in&s;tinct of Nature, tend to the enriching of &s;ome Per&s;ons, to the Damage and Wrong of others.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the Roman Catholick Ma|gi&s;trate and the Clergy of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> and <HI>Ep|peries,</HI> by their own Authority, and by Force have taken and appropriated to them&s;elves, all the pious Legacies and Gifts left by Will, through the pious zeal of the Prote&s;tants, for the u&s;e of Prote&s;tant Churches and Schools, (<HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> four Hou&s;es &s;tanding within the Wall of the &s;aid City, one of which the Magi&s;trate has &s;old, and alienated to the illu&s;trious <HI>Michael Domeczki;</HI> a Garden and certain Plow Lands lying in the Territory of the &s;ame City; as al&s;o a Vineyard formerly called <HI>Vargha&s;z&oacute;l&oacute;,</HI> lying in the Territory of <HI>Tokai.</HI> And in <HI>Epperies</HI> certain Vineyards likewi&s;e lying in &s;everal Territories of Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> together with their Revenues) actually retaining the &s;ame for their own u&s;e, and for the mo&s;t part turning them into prophane u&s;es, again&s;t the 11th and 14th Articles of the year 1647, to the great injury and damage of the Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>Wherefore in this Ca&s;e al&s;o, the Prote|&s;tants appealing to the afore&s;aid Laws, and Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, do lawfully require, that all the pious Legacies and Church Lands (violently taken away and retain'd from them, who are the right Owners) be re&s;tor'd together with their Revenues, according to that Rule of Com|mon Ju&s;tice, Render to every one his own.</P>
<P>Fifthly, It is certain likewi&s;e, that for the paying of the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters, and of the Catholick Curates, it was evidently enough provided, not only by the often mentioned 26th Article in the&s;e words: <HI>Neverthele&s;s, the Catholicks &s;hall not be obliged to pay any thing to the Mini&s;ters of the Prote&s;tants, nor the Prote&s;tants to the Curates of the Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P>But al&s;o by the 11th Article of the year 1647 in the&s;e words; <HI>Let no Prote&s;tant be obliged to pay any thing to the Catholick Curates, nor the Catholick to the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, in the following 12th Article of the &s;aid year 1647, are contained the&s;e words: <HI>Concerning any u&s;e whatever of the Mini&s;terial Functions; but where the Prote|&s;tants have no Pari&s;hes, let them pay the Mi|ni&s;ters that they employ, as the Catholicks are to pay their Catholick Curates; and where hitherto the Prote&s;tants did pay nothing to
<PB N="67" REF="42"> the Catholick Curates, they &s;hall not be obliged hereafter to pay any under any pretence what|&s;oever, nor the Catholicks to the Prote&s;tant Min&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>Which words, together with the&s;e of the &s;ame 12th Article concerning the Reve|nues of Schools; but in any place what|&s;oever, the Catholick Curates, and the Pro|te&s;tant Mini&s;ters &s;hall receive the Revenues of Schools, from their re&s;pective Follow|ers only. E&s;tabli&s;h this po&s;itive Law and Con&s;titution, that the Prote&s;tants pay the Prote&s;tants, and the Catholicks the Catho|licks: Notwith&s;tanding this, the Prote|&s;tants are forced maugre them&s;elves, to pay the Catholick Curates, whil&s;t not only a Weekly allowance, together with other perqui&s;ites, is con&s;tantly paid to the Ca|tholick Curates by the Magi&s;trate out of the publick Pur&s;e (wherein the Prote&s;tants put mo&s;t, being three for one Catholick;) but al&s;o, the Revenues of Schools are ad|judged, and paid to the &s;ame Catholick Cu|rates, and with the greate&s;t inju&s;tice deny'd to the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters and School-Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Therefore they demand with all Sub|mi&s;&s;ion and Ju&s;tice, that the Prote&s;tant Mi|ni&s;ters and School-ma&s;ters, be allow'd out of the publick Pur&s;e, a Salary equal with that of the Catholick Curates, or that nei|ther of the Parties be paid out of that Fond, but each by their re&s;pective Follow|ers, according to the intention of the before mention'd Articles.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Every body knows that by Vertue of the 25th Article, not only a free return and &s;tay in the Kingdom is granted to the Bani&s;ht Mini&s;ters and School-ma&s;ters, but al&s;o a free exerci&s;e of their Religion and Profe&s;&s;ion, and by Vertue of the fol|lowing 26th Article it is Order'd, That a|mong&s;t the imperial and free Cities of Up|per <HI>Hungary, Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> and <HI>Epperies</HI> &s;hall be appointed, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd places for the publick and free exerci&s;e of the Prote&s;tant Religion; and that hereafter, no Subject &s;hall be di&s;turb'd in the free exerci&s;e of his Religion, under the pain expre&s;&s;ed in the 8th Article, of the 6th Decree of <HI>Ula|di&s;laus.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, the Magi&s;trate of <HI>Ep|peries,</HI> on the very Fe&s;tival Day of St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Apo&s;tle, in the Year 1688 la&s;t pa&s;t, dar'd deprive the Prote&s;tant Church of <HI>Epperies,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Arti|cles of their Mini&s;ters, and with great di&s;honour expel all the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters of the three Nations, out of the &s;aid City and its Territory, without letting them know any cau&s;e of &s;o inju&s;t an u&s;age, or &s;hewing them any Warrant of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty for it; protending only an unheard of Title of Lord of the Manor, (which cannot be admitted among Civili|ans, &s;ince they enjoy equaly with the Ma|gi&s;trate the common civil Liberty, nor among&s;t Clergy Men, who enjoy a &s;pecial Liberty, nor can it in any wi&s;e be taken by Magi&s;trate, who&s;e Office is but for a year) to the great dimini&s;hing of His mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty's Authority and the Con|tempt of the before mentioned Articles.</P>
<P>Wherefore they humbly beg, that the innocent and unju&s;tly Bani&s;h'd Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters of <HI>Epperies</HI> be re&s;tor'd, and may perform as before their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Duties, and that both the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Epperies,</HI> employ'd either in Preaching, or in Teaching Schools, pre&s;ent or to come (being always pre&s;ented by the right Patrons,) may live quietly and &s;afely in their own or hir'd dwelling places, which they have, or &s;hall have within the Walls of the &s;aid Cities.</P>
<P>Seventhly, No body that knows the Law will deny, but in the beginning of the afore&s;aid 41&s;t Article of the Diet of <HI>Sopron,</HI> where the Common Liberties and Privile|ges of the imperial and free Cities are confirm'd, and be&s;ides the there mention'd Laws, and Articles of the Kingdom made in &s;everal places are renewed, it is expre&s;ly ordain'd: <HI>That the &s;ame Laws and Articles be &s;trictly ob&s;erved, both by the Chambers and the Officers of the Army, and by any other per&s;on what&s;oever, &s;o that they</HI> (viz. <HI>the &s;ame imperial and free Cities) be no way di&s;turbed by any one, in their free right to chu&s;e a Civil Magi&s;trate, nor in any other Privilege.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the modern Magi&s;trate of the &s;aid Cities, again&s;t the Prohibition con|tain'd in the 83th Article of the Illu&s;trious Chamber of <HI>Scepu&s;ium,</HI> in the year 1647, out of meer private hatred again&s;t our Religion; was plea&s;ed to take upon him &s;uch a Power, as to degrade, and turn out of their publick Dignities, and Civil Em|ployments all the Senators of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia</HI> and <HI>Epperies,</HI> and &s;everal other Prote&s;tant Of|ficers well de&s;erving, and qualified for pub|lick Offices and Civil Dignities, again&s;t the evident Con&s;titution of the afore&s;aid Ar|ticle, and of tho&s;e that are cited in it; but e&s;pecially of the 13th, before the Corona|tion in the year 1608, of the 44th in the year 1609, and of the 12th in the year 1649, to the mo&s;t evident prejudice of the Common Liberties, and Civil Privileges, and to the con&s;iderable oppre&s;&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant Citizens; and in the room of the &s;aid Senators and Prote&s;tant Officers, the &s;aid Magi&s;trate has put Catholick Ci|tizens either le&s;s fit, or wholly unacquain|ted
<PB N="68" REF="43"> with the Affairs of the &s;aid Cities, and more minding their private concerns, to the damnifying and even undoing of the &s;aid Cities. Wherefore we require with the deepe&s;t Humility,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the free right of chu&s;ing the Civil Magi&s;trate, and other Officers (which hitherto has been &s;o di&s;turbed, and wholly taken away from the Prote|&s;tants, again&s;t the po&s;itive Laws of the Kingdom, made in the Illu&s;trious Cham|ber of <HI>Scepu&s;ium</HI>) belonging properly and only to the Sworn Citizens of the &s;ame Cities, and as well to the Prote&s;tants as to the Catholicks, be re&s;tor'd and maintain'd in its former State, and in no wi&s;e any more di&s;turbed by any one, under the pain mention'd in the renewed and afore&s;aid Articles.</P>
<P>Secondly, That in order to maintain a civil mutual Union, and put out any Fewel of Divi&s;ion and Hatred, a free Election be made of the &s;ame Magi&s;trate, and other Officers out of the well de&s;erving, and well qualified Sworn Citizens, without any dif|ference of the Catholick and Prote&s;tant Religion; and that the Employments, and any Civil Dignities what&s;oever be indiffe|rently, and equally conferr'd and be&s;towed, &s;o that the Catholicks and Prote&s;tants pro|mote mutually one another to publick, civil Honours, according to the intention of the afore&s;aid 13th Article, of the year 1608 before the Coronation, and of the 44th of the year 1609.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That in order to ob&s;erve a ju&s;t equality of Turns, and procure the publick good of the Cities, it be graciou&s;ly granted, that the Offices of Judge and <HI>Tribune</HI> be by Turns, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly exerci&s;ed for a year, according to the intention of the afore&s;aid Articles, and of the 12th in the year 1649.</P>
<P>All the Prote&s;tant, Citizens, and Inhabitants of the three Nations, of the Free and Imperial Cities, <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ovia</HI> and <HI>Epperies.</HI></P>

<P>THe Prote&s;tant Citizens and Inhabi|tants, together with the Militia of <HI>Moramoru&s;s</HI> complain, that altho' by Vertue of the 26th Article of <HI>Sopron,</HI> (wherein the &s;ame City of <HI>Moramoru&s;s</HI> is expre&s;ly, named,) they had obtain'd the liberty of exerci&s;ing publickly their Religion, and of having Churches, Pari&s;hes and Schools; and have quietly enjoyed the &s;ame with|out giving any offence to the Catholicks, until the fatal breaking out of the Wars in the year 1683, and the unexpected Burning of the Town, which occa&s;ion'd an inter|ruption of the &s;aid Exerci&s;e of Religion, the Mini&s;ters and their Pari&s;hioners having been forced to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves up and down; yet &s;ince the Troubles are appea&s;ed, they de&s;ire in vain to rea&s;&s;ume their publick exerci&s;e of Religion, and to call back their Mini&s;ters, being hinder'd from the &s;ame by the Earl of <HI>Hoffkirchen</HI> Governour of this Territory, who every day growing &s;everer, forbids with greater Threats, the total Ex|erci&s;e of the Prote&s;tant Religion: Nay, three Months ago the Roman Catholicks did Pro|claim with the Beat of Drums, that no Prote&s;tant &s;hould pre&s;ume to go out of the Territory of <HI>Moramoru&s;s,</HI> to any Neigh|bouring, to perform the Duties of his Re|ligion; nor Exerci&s;e it in his private Hou&s;e under pain of Impri&s;onment, and of other &s;evere Puni&s;hments. Therefore they Hum|bly beg, That this their Grievance may be redre&s;&s;ed, and they re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Privilege granted by the Article.</P>
<P>It may be added to the foregoing Grie|vances, that one <HI>Samuel Bizkey,</HI> a Prote|&s;tant Mini&s;ter of a place of Lower <HI>Hun|gary</HI> called <HI>Hedes;</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Pro|tection granted to him by the Council of War, has been Plunder'd twice of all the means of Life, Clothes, Books and Furni|ture, by &s;ome Emi&s;&s;aries of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gran;</HI> and at la&s;t on the 22d of the la&s;t Month of <HI>March,</HI> was taken and carried to <HI>Presburg,</HI> into the Pri&s;ons of the Arch|bi&s;hop, where he has nothing allowed him, but dry Bread and dirty Water.</P>

<P>To the&s;e Agrievances the Emperor re|turned a very Gracious An&s;wer, and made &s;everal Propo&s;als tending to a Peace.</P>

<P>Fourthly, That all the vacant Offices, Governours and Balliages of that Kingdom, &s;hould be indifferently conferr'd upon <HI>Hun|garian</HI> Gentlemen, who were capable by their Natural parts, and Abilities to Merit and Di&s;charge &s;uch Preferments.</P>

<P>The Plague which &s;till Raged in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> prevented the proceedings of this Treaty, which might have taken ef|fect &s;ome time before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Treaty was broken off.</NOTE> and an&s;wer'd all the Demands of the Malecontents; but now &s;o much Blood had been drawn in all Parts, and Corners of that unhappy Kingdom, that it was pa&s;t the Art of Man to &s;tanch the Bleeding: And be&s;ides, <HI>Tekeli</HI> and his Malecontents were &s;o nearly adjoyn'd, and engaged in &s;ecret Leagues, and Alliances with the <HI>Turk,</HI> that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble to de&s;tricate, and di&s;entangle them|&s;elves from the invitations they had made, and from the A&s;&s;urances, and Pledges they had given to the <HI>Turks.</HI> How&s;oever, the Emperor not to leave any means unattemp|ted, until all was become de&s;perate, di&s;|patched Count <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> into <HI>Hungary</HI> in quality of his Plenipotentiary, to put tho&s;e Overtures into Execution which had been fram'd, and debated in the Emperor's Council. But whil&s;t the&s;e things were in agitation, they received another Impedi|ment, by a di&s;covery made of a Corre&s;pon|dence, which &s;everal Principal Officers held with the Maleconts; upon which <HI>Filek,</HI> and two other Councellors, and Mannagers of the Revenue of <HI>Hungary</HI> were Arre&s;ted, and accu&s;ed of having moved, and promoted an In&s;urrection in divers Counties.</P>
<P>Towards the end of this year, when the Armies were drawn into their Winter quarters, new Treaties were &s;et on foot. The Baron <HI>de Kaunitz</HI> the Emperor's Re&s;i|dent at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> labour'd to conti|nue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kaunitz</HI> Treats with the Grand Seignior.</NOTE> and renew the Truce; but the Grand Vizier would not agree thereunto on any other Terms, than that it might be allow|able for the Grand Seignior to afford aid, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Malecontents: But this was to cure a Soar with a greater Evil, and what was incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, to make a Peace, and yet to continue a War.</P>
<P>When the Emperor believed all Accomo|dation with the Malecontents impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t far di&s;tant; Behold on a &s;uddain, and much unexpected, the Counts <HI>Tekeli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> and others of|fer Condi|tions.</NOTE> <HI>Pe&s;trozzi</HI> and <HI>We&s;&s;ellino</HI> in de&s;pight of their Engagements to the <HI>Turks,</HI> offer'd to make Terms by them&s;elves; and to abandon their People and their Cau&s;e, in ca&s;e they a&s;|&s;ented not thereunto; The Conditions were to have all their Churches re&s;tor'd, with their Goods and E&s;tates, which had been Confi&s;cated: To which the Emperor readily a&s;&s;enting, there never appear'd at any time a greater probability and likely|hood of an Agreement, than upon this o|verture: But whereas to e&s;tabli&s;h and con|firm &s;uch an Accomodation, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to convene a Diet, which by rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent Contagion could not be done, a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms was in the mean time concluded: But whil&s;t in order thereunto a Conference was held at <HI>Tokai,</HI> Count <HI>Caprara</HI> unluckily march'd out of his Quar|ters with a con&s;iderable force towards that place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is again broken.</NOTE> upon which the Malecontens were &s;o Allarum'd, that they Sallied out of their Winter quarters in great numbers, leaving the Treaty imperfect, and the Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms broken and violated.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the unlucky Accidents which had happen'd to hinder, and di&s;ap|point the Progre&s;s of the afore&s;aid Treaties; Yet at the beginning of this year new over|tures were made to the Malecontents by the Bi&s;hop <HI>Sebe&s;tini:</HI> And tho' &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of the <HI>Hunga|rian</HI> party, refu&s;ed to hearken to any Of|fers which the Emperor &s;hould make them; yet <HI>Tekeli,</HI> and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> and other chiefs &s;end Depu|ties to <HI>Lintz.</HI></NOTE> formerly the mo&s;t aver&s;e to all Accommodation, did now at lea&s;t in a &s;eeming manner favour the Me|thods which tended towards Peace; and in order thereunto, did not only di&s;|patch Deputies as far as to <HI>Lintz,</HI> to Treat thereupon with the Imperial Mini&s;ters; but likewi&s;e entertain'd a per&s;onal Confer|ence with Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> and agreed with him to continue a Truce until the re&s;ult of a Diet &s;hould be known, which was to con|vene in the Month of <HI>Febuary.</HI></P>
<P>That which in all appearance was mo&s;t probable to admini&s;ter the greate&s;t difficul|ty, and cau&s;e of di&s;pute, when a Diet &s;hould a&s;&s;emble, was the re&s;titution of the Churches, Schools, and other Foundations which the Malecontents challenged as their own, and upon the Right, and Title of
<PB N="75" REF="46"> having Erected, and Built them at their own charge and expence. They were al&s;o very po&s;itive to have their ancient Govern|ment by a Palatine re&s;tor'd, and all the <HI>German</HI> Garri&s;ons withdrawn out of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> at lea&s;t, that the Officers placed over the <HI>German</HI> Forces &s;hould be <HI>Hungarians,</HI> the better to keep the Souldiers within &s;ome Terms of Moderation, and Good Be|haviour towards the People of the Country.</P>
<P>The time appointed for the Diet to meet being come, the Emperor remov'd to <HI>New|&s;tadt,</HI> to be nearer to the place of Treaty. But it being the Fate of that poor King|dom to be unhappy, &s;omething or other &s;till intervened to prevent and di&s;appoint the Endeavours of Peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plot to &s;eize <HI>Tekeli</HI> du|ring the Truce.</NOTE> for whil&s;t &s;ome labour'd in that good Work, others made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to impede and divert it. And &s;o it was at pre&s;ent; for whil&s;t <HI>Tekeli</HI> was delighting him&s;elf at a Hou&s;e of Plea|&s;ure, a Plot was laid to &s;urprize and take him during the Truce; of which <HI>Tekeli</HI> having notice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it was pre|vented.</NOTE> he countermined the Plot by an Ambu&s;cade; which being oppor|tunely di&s;po&s;ed in the way where they were to pa&s;s, the Party which came to &s;eize him was totally defeated. This, and other Artifices of the like nature, foment|ed jealou&s;ies and diffidences between the Parties, that nothing was acted clearly, and with a free Spirit, but with &s;uch Cau|tion and re&s;erves, as ea&s;ily pre&s;aged the little hopes of an accommodation by way of Treaty. How&s;oever, &s;ome Zealous Men, &s;uch as <HI>E&s;terha&s;i,</HI> and <HI>Forgatz,</HI> who were pa&s;&s;ionate for the peace of their Country, travel'd from County to County, exhorting the People to lay a&s;ide all Animo&s;ities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> and <HI>For|gatz</HI> make offers of Peace.</NOTE> and return again unto that Allegiance and Duty which they ow'd unto their Prince; upon a&s;&s;u|rance that the Emperor would re&s;tore the State of <HI>Hungary</HI> to the &s;ame Condition in which it was in the year 1662. and grant almo&s;t all the other Propo&s;itions which the Malecontents did demand; provided that the States of that Kingdom would de|clare the Arch-Duke <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Son to the Em|peror, King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>To this Propo&s;al the Malecontents were ready al&s;o to conde&s;cend; on Condition, that at the &s;ame time the Kingdom were declar'd Elective, and &s;ome Acts repeal'd, which in the year 1664 had made it He|reditary.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this difficulty, and di|vers others which were daily &s;tarted, di&s;|plea&s;ing to the Emperor, the Meeting of a Diet at <HI>Oedemburg</HI> was &s;o warmly pre&s;s'd, that the Emperor's Commi&s;&s;ioners, and fourteen Deputies from the Malecontents A&s;&s;embled in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> as was agreed, tho' <HI>Tekeli</HI> refus'd to be there pre&s;ent, alledging that the late Treacherous De&s;ign again&s;t his Per&s;on, was a &s;ufficient and a ju&s;t Excu&s;e for his Ab&s;ence. This, and &s;ome Di&s;pute about the place of Meet|ing (which the Imperiali&s;ts de&s;ired might be at <HI>Presburg</HI>) occa&s;ion'd a Prorogation of the Diet until <HI>April</HI> next following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diet prorogued until <HI>Apr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll.</HI></NOTE> In the mean time the Malecontents held their Con&s;ultations in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> concerning the Mea&s;ures and Methods they were to take in the next Campaign; and made u&s;e of the ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, to fortifie their Garri&s;ons, and &s;upply them with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Clergy of <HI>Hungary</HI> finding in the Emperor a Spirit &s;o inclin'd unto Peace, that he was ready to conde&s;cend unto all the Demands of the Malecontents; and with the re&s;t, to grant and yield unto them all the Churches, of which they had been depriv'd; they being touch'd with a &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;chief which might accrue to them&s;elves thereby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clergy endeavour to di&s;turb the Diet.</NOTE> &s;ent their Deputies to <HI>Vienna</HI> before the Convention of the Diet, to repre&s;ent unto the Emperor the great prejudice, damage and &s;candal he would cau&s;e to the Catholick Religion, by delivering up the Churches, which were already Con&s;ecrated, and Hallowed to the Service of God, to be prophaned by Im|pious and Heretical Wor&s;hips.

And moreover Fa|ther <HI>Emeric</HI> excepting again&s;t every Per&s;on which the Diet propos'd for Palatine, gave a &s;top to all Proceedings, that the A&s;&s;embly was upon di&s;&s;olving; and Prince <HI>Swartzem|burg</HI> became &s;o tired and wearied with the many unprofitable and fruitle&s;s endeavours, that he deliver'd up his Commi&s;&s;ion to, Count <HI>Capeliers,</HI> Superintendant of the Council of War, to pre&s;ide in his Place.</P>
<P>And &s;o re&s;tle&s;s were the Soldiers, and difficult to be re&s;train'd from breaking out into Acts of Ho&s;tility, that during the Ce&s;|&s;ation of Arms, a Party of the Malecontents fell upon a Regiment of the Imperiali&s;ts and cut them in pieces.</P>

The Emperor upon notice of this private and perfidious Treaty with the <HI>Turk,</HI> was highly incen&s;ed, and com|manded that neither <HI>Tekeli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> for|bid the Diet.</NOTE> nor any of tho&s;e who were concern'd in this Confe|rence, &s;hould be admitted as Members in|to the Diet: And giving it now for grant|ed, that a War would en&s;ue with the <HI>Turk,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Baden</HI> was ordered to For|tify <HI>Raab,</HI> and Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> to fini&s;h the Fortifications of <HI>Vienna,</HI> from the <HI>Ar|&s;enal</HI> of which place great quantities of Granadoes, Bombs, Powder, with Arms, and heavy Cannon were tran&s;ported down the <HI>Danube,</HI> to &s;upply that Important For|tre&s;s of <HI>Raab.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all which, the Deputies continued to labour in the Diet, and to ex|amin the Aggrievances of the Malecontents; and the Palatine <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> made frequent Journies between <HI>Oedemburg,</HI> and <HI>New&s;tadt</HI> to render an Account of all Pa&s;&s;ages, and Tran&s;actions to the Emperor: And that a
<PB N="77" REF="47"> conclu&s;ion might be put to all matters in que&s;tion; the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Vienna</HI> went to the Diet, to agree certain differences ari&s;en between the Clergy and the Laity of <HI>Hungary,</HI> touching the Title to &s;ome Lands and Deme&s;nes, which was &s;till depending in a Law Suit between them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts made at the Diet.</NOTE> After this Point was agreed, the whole Re&s;ult of the Diet was drawn up in Writing, and &s;ent to <HI>Tekeli;</HI> the Sub&s;tance whereof was this, That all the Churches which the Prote|&s;tants had Built at their own charge and expence &s;hould be re&s;tor'd; with free Li|cen&s;e to Erect and Build more, in any part of the Kidgdom, and therein to exerci&s;e their Religion, and publickly to Preach. That a con&s;iderable Sum of Mony &s;hould be paid to the <HI>Turks</HI> for once and no more, but not by way of Tribute: Provided that the Truce made in the year 1664, be again renewed for twenty years longer, under the &s;ame Articles and Conditions: And farther, &s;everal expedients and means were agreed for rai&s;ing Monies for pay|ment of the Troops, and defraying the charges of the Kingdom, during the&s;e times of trouble. To confirm all which <HI>Tekeli</HI> was de&s;ired to appear at the Diet (notwith|&s;tanding the late Prohibition) and to con|cur with the other Deputies by Signing the&s;e Articles:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> cal|led to the Diet.</NOTE> And le&s;t he &s;hould make the in&s;ecurity of his Per&s;on an excu&s;e for his Non-appearance, the Son of Count <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> the Palatine, was offer'd for a Ho&s;tage. <MILESTONE N="1681"> The&s;e Propo&s;als were carried to <HI>Tekeli</HI> by the Secretary to the Palatine, who return'd from him in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> unto the Diet &s;till Sitting at <HI>Oedem|burg;</HI> with an an&s;wer to this effect; That <HI>Tekeli</HI> would not be &s;atisfied with le&s;s, than an entire re&s;titution of all the Churches: That one &s;ingle Sum of what value &s;oever would not content the <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tekeli's <HI>an&s;wer.</HI></NOTE> who requir'd an Annual Tribute of 40.000 Rix Dollars, without which they refu&s;ed to re&s;tore to the Malecontents their Wives, and Chil|dren which they had given in Ho&s;tage: And moreover, this Me&s;&s;enger gave them to under&s;tand, that <HI>Tekeli</HI> ab&s;olutely refu|&s;ed to appear at the Diet, and that He, and his Party were not &s;atisfied with the Election of <HI>E&s;terha&s;i</HI> to be Palatine. This an&s;wer was the cau&s;e of much Debate and Divi&s;ion in the Diet; and their Minds and Councils were farther di&s;turbed upon the News, that the Forces of the Malecontents being joyn'd with a con&s;iderable Body both of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ilvanians,</HI> were become 15.000 &s;trong; that the <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Waradin</HI> kept &s;o clo&s;e a Corre&s;pendence with the Malecontents, that it was more than pro|bable, that their intere&s;t and alliances were &s;o firmly united, that neither Party was at liberty to make Terms, or Articles of Peace without the A&s;&s;ent, or Concurrence of the other. The truth of which &s;oon appear'd; for <HI>Tekeli</HI> not long afterwards marched near the Confines of <HI>Belgrade,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> joins with the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> where he joyned with a Body of 20.000 <HI>Turks;</HI> and thereby gave evident Demon|&s;trations of his Re&s;olution to maintain the War, and that his former propo&s;als, and &s;teps towards Peace, were all fal&s;e and feigned, with de&s;ign to Amu&s;e the Minds of the Emperor and the Diet. The <HI>Turks</HI> had not as yet declar'd a War, for their Forces and Troops from the remote parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> were not in a readine&s;s, nor on their March; till which time the Emperor was to be amu&s;ed with Treaties, and the appearance of that great Body of <HI>Turks</HI> near <HI>Belgrade,</HI> was with preten&s;ion only to re&s;tore <HI>Tekeli</HI> to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Lands, Hou&s;es, and E&s;tate, of which he had been unju&s;tly deprived by the Emperor, and his Favourites.</P>
<P>The Emperor finding it now ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to conclude an Accommodation with the Malecontents, among&s;t whom new difficulties daily aro&s;e, returned in Per&s;on from <HI>New&s;tadt</HI> to the Diet at <HI>Oedemburg,</HI> where the Malecontents thought it rea&s;ona|ble, that the Tribute which they had en|gaged to pay unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;hould be charged and levied on the E&s;tates of tho&s;e, who had been the cau&s;es of the Troubles, and Confu&s;ions in that Kingdom. This motion had &s;o little ground, and was &s;o unlikely to &s;ucceed, that it put all things backwards; and induced the Emperor to limit the Se&s;&s;ion of the Diet to the 16th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> hoping within that time to agree on all Points with &s;uch, who continued con&s;tant in their Loyalty and Allegiance to him; and for particular Aggrievances, they were to be compo&s;ed by a Select Com|mittee appointed for that purpo&s;e. But all this while mo&s;t of the Prote&s;tants refu&s;ed to come to the Diet, by rea&s;on that the Points about Religion were po&s;t-poned, by the endeavours of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Stri|gonium,</HI> which they in the fir&s;t place, and before all other Matters de&s;ir'd to have de|cided.</P>
<P>This Point being laid a&s;ide, the Diet fell to debate on the Propo&s;ition &s;ent by <HI>Tekeli,</HI> relating to a Tribute demanded by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and as an expedient, and by way of Equivalent for that, it was propo&s;ed to re&s;ign into the Hands of the <HI>Turks</HI> three Counties, <HI>viz. Kalo, Zatmar</HI> and <HI>Liptpow;</HI> to which the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eemed with &s;ome rea|&s;on to claim a Title, in regard, that no longer than &s;ince the year 1660, they had been disjoyn'd from the Principality of <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania.</HI> But an end was &s;oon put to this
<PB N="78" REF="48"> Controver&s;ie; for both the <HI>Hungarians</HI> them&s;elves were unwilling to have a Peace purcha&s;ed from the <HI>Turk</HI> at the price of their Country, by di&s;membring three Coun|ties from that Kingdom; at the mentioning only of which the People were &s;o enraged, that fearing le&s;t the Emperor &s;hould pri|vately conclude &s;ome Article with the <HI>Turk</HI> in reference thereunto, they would not be &s;atisfied until he had permitted them to joyn one of their Confidents with <HI>Ca|prara,</HI> the Emperor's Re&s;ident at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> who might be privy to all the Trea|ties, and Negotiations with the <HI>Turk;</HI> nor would the <HI>Turks</HI> accept thereof in &s;atisfa|ction for renewing the Truce, but rai&s;ed new and greater Demands, as they found the Emperor inclinable to yield and con|de&s;cend:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> rai&s;e their Demands.</NOTE> For now the Grand Vizier requi|red to have <HI>Leopol&s;tadt</HI> demoli&s;h'd, on pretence that it had been Built, and Forti|fied contrary to the Articles of the late Treaty: And declar'd likewi&s;e the Grand Seignior's re&s;olution, to give aid and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to the Malecontents, until &s;uch time, as he had put them into a capacity of paying the Annual Tribute, for which they were engaged.</P>
<P>New difficulties were every day &s;tarted at the Diet, &s;o that the Emperor was de|&s;irous to di&s;&s;olve it, &s;o &s;oon as was po&s;&s;i|ble; but yet he thought not fit to do it abruptly, or to break it up in di&s;content; but that &s;omething might be done in mat|ters of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror Grants &s;everal matters.</NOTE> on which the Prote&s;tants mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted: In order unto which it was agreed, to grant them a hundred Churches, with Money to build others, in places mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>That all Cities and Towns, &s;hould enjoy a free exerci&s;e of their Religion: And that all <HI>Hungarian</HI> Soldiers in the Frontier Garri&s;ons &s;hould do the like.</P>

<P>That <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> might build Churches in any Town, or City where they were wanting, and Lords and Gentlemen might build Chappels, or Orato|ries in any of their Hou&s;es, or Ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>That in ca&s;e any Points of Difference &s;hould ari&s;e relating to Religion, or the Matters preceeding, they were not to be decided by the Sword, but by the Sentence of the King of <HI>Hungary.</HI> And that all People of what Per&s;wa&s;ion &s;oever might live amicably, no Per&s;on was to Revile the other on account of his or their Reli|gion, or to utter injurious or unhan&s;ome Terms thereof.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars with &s;ome additional Regulations, being at la&s;t agreed in the Diet, and &s;ign'd by the Emperor; The next great work was, in what manner the Malecontents might be re&s;tor'd to their E&s;tates, and to their Goods which had been confi&s;cated: And how the <HI>German</HI> Troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aggrie|vances con|&s;idered.</NOTE> and &s;tranger Soldiers might with &s;afety and ea&s;e be removed out of their Garri&s;ons, and all parts of <HI>Hungary;</HI> which next to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, was the greate&s;t con|cernment of the Diet. The next Aggrie|vance was the Chamber of the Kingdom, which Office, contrary to the will and ap|probation of the Deputies of the States, was executed by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>New&s;tadt,</HI> whom they con&s;ider'd as the Chief Au|thor, and Fomenter of all the Troubles of that Kingdom: But herein, the Emperor was not willing as yet to gratify the Diet. Nor could the Deputies agree among&s;t them&s;elves of the manner, how to make tho&s;e things practicable, which they in the mo&s;t erarne&s;t manner de&s;ir'd: And &s;uch were the Divi&s;ions among&s;t them, that what the Seculars agreed upon in the Morning, was di&s;turbed, and undone by the Clergy in the Afternoon; which the Emperor well con&s;idering, and how Men of &s;uch dif|ferent intere&s;ts perplex all Councils; was plea&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Strigo|nium,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>New&s;tadt,</HI> as al&s;o the Count <HI>Capliers,</HI> a great &s;tickler for the Rights of the Church, from their atten|dance on the Diet; &s;o that the Imperial Commi&s;&s;ioners were reduced to three Per|&s;ons, namely the Prince of <HI>Swartzemburg,</HI> the Count of <HI>No&s;tiz,</HI> and <HI>Oker</HI> the Chan|cellour. And farther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror &s;atisfies the Male|contents.</NOTE> to &s;atisfy the Male|contents in their preten&s;ions, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>New&s;tadt,</HI> was put by his Office of Vice-Pre&s;ident of the Chamber of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the &s;ame was conferr'd on Count <HI>Erdedi,</HI> a Per&s;on much more acceptable to the Peo|ple. This gracious Clemency and Compli|ance of the Emperor, was &s;o &s;atisfactory to the Prote&s;tants, that they wholly &s;ubmit|ted that point about the confi&s;cated Goods to the favour, and benign inclinations of his Imperial Maje&s;ty, who not to abu&s;e that confidence which his Subjects repo&s;ed in him, did freely, and of his own accord, give order, that the Goods, and E&s;tates of the Counts <HI>Serini, Nada&s;ti,</HI> and <HI>Frangipani,</HI> with tho&s;e of &s;everal other Lords, that had been confi&s;cated for High Trea&s;on, &s;hould be re&s;tor'd again to their Children or Heirs.

<P>ALthough we have already made it appear to Your mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty, and to the Mini&s;ters of Your mo&s;t Imperial Court, that many Inju&s;tices were done to us in the Year 1681, again&s;t the clear and evident Grants of the 25th and 26th Articles of <HI>Sopron,</HI> Humbly &s;olliciting this full Year and a Half the Ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame, and the Redre&s;&s;ing of the Grievances of our Evangelical Religion; yet, becau&s;e it is daily Reported, that by Virtue of Your Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ions appointed la&s;t Year, and before through <HI>Hungary</HI> nothing was Ordered, again&s;t the full intent of the &s;aid Articles, and that we de&s;ire more than is granted in them: We thought it our Duty to ju&s;tify both our Complaints and our repeated Reque&s;ts, (the reather becau&s;e the Worthy Mini&s;ters of Your Imperial Court have often a&s;&s;ur'd us, that without any delay or difficulty, we &s;hould be maintain'd in the clear Grants of the &s;aid Articles of <HI>Sopron,</HI>) in order to which we &s;hall &s;et down here, as in a kind of Table, the very words of the &s;aid Articles, together with our Reque&s;ts, again&s;t the Mi&s;intepretation of the &s;aid Articles, either by Your Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioners, or by other Per&s;ons under pretence of fulfiling the &s;ame, and the Deci&s;ions made thereupon, by that means we &s;hall &s;hew Evidently that the &s;aid Articles were Infring'd to our great prejudice, and that our Reque&s;ts are mo&s;t Ju&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>XXV ARTICLE</HI> runs thus:</HEAD>
<P>AND becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty intending the Peace and general Quiet of the Kingdom was plea&s;ed al&s;o to come to a Gracious Re&s;olution upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, therefore the States of the King|dom in&s;ert the &s;aid Re&s;olution in the Arti|cles.</P>
<P N="1">I. <Q REND="margQuotes">And Principally, whereas the free exerci&s;e of Religion (granted in the year 1606. by virtue of the Peace of <HI>Vienna</HI>) has been di&s;turbed in part during the&s;e Troubles; therefore (the fir&s;t Article of the &s;aid Peace being hereby confirm'd) the &s;ame free exerci&s;e of Religion is granted to every Per&s;on, and every where in the Kingdom; according to the fir&s;t Article made before the Coronation in the year 1608. Provided that the Privileges of Lords of Manors be not hereby prejudiced.</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon we require in the Article's own words, that the &s;ame free exerci&s;e of Reli|gion (as was di&s;turbed in part during the Troubles, and before the Troubles did in|clude Evangelical Mini&s;ters or Preachers) be granted to every Per&s;on, and every where in the Kingdom, not excepting the free Cities, Towns and Villages, which make the fourth State, &s;ince they are expre&s;ly comprehended in the afore&s;aid Article made before the Coronation in the Year 1608.</P>
<P N="2">II. <Q REND="margQuotes">A free Return in the Kingdom, and a free exerci&s;e of Religion is granted al&s;o to all the Mini&s;ters and School-ma&s;ters, that are

<P>From thence it follows evidently, that the Mini&s;ters and Schoolma&s;ters are to be re&s;tor'd from their Exile to their re&s;pective Profe&s;&s;ions, and may live freely in any City, Town or Village of the Kingdom, per|forming the Duties of their Religion and Profe&s;&s;ion, and that no more Deeds of Re|ver&s;ion can be requir'd from them, &s;ince &s;uch Deeds are condemned in the Article.</P>
<P N="3">III. <Q REND="margQuotes">And no <HI>Hungarian</HI> Subject &s;hall be di&s;turbed any way hereafter in the free Exerci&s;e of his Religion.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words, no <HI>Hungarian</HI> Subject ex|clude undoubtedly any Exception; the mean|ing plainly is, that no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Ci|vil Per&s;on, no Nobleman, no Citizen, nor Pea&s;ant ought to be di&s;turbed in the free exerci&s;e of Religion, and no Body will deny, but that an exerci&s;e of Religion can in no &s;en&s;e be term'd free, unle&s;s there be Mini|&s;ters that officiate in it.</P>

But what kind of Liberty it is, that hath been granted to our Mini&s;ters to profe&s;s their Religion; appears <HI>1&s;t,</HI> By the Record|ed Bani&s;hment of a great many of them out of the Counties. <HI>2ly,</HI> By the Ca&s;e of the Mini&s;ters in <HI>Eperies,</HI> that have been turn'd out by a Roman Catholick Magi&s;trate, under pretence that it was Your Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure and Command, altho' that Town be particularly named in the Articles. <HI>3ly,</HI> By the violence that the Official has done to the Mini&s;ters and School-ma&s;ters, that liv'd but mi&s;erably in the Dominion of <HI>Tokai</HI> in Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> intimating to them under pain of Death, and the Forfeiture of all their Goods, to go out of the &s;aid County, or by mo&s;t &s;trict Deeds of Rever&s;ion, to renounce for ever under the &s;ame penalty to perform any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Duty in the &s;aid County. <HI>4ly,</HI> By the Confinement of &s;everal Mini&s;ters, who are kept Pri&s;oners in the Fort of <HI>Ledniche,</HI> by Order of his Eminence the Cardinal of <HI>Kolocza,</HI> and can obtain their Liberty on no other Condition, but that of &s;ub&s;cribing pernicious Deeds of Rever&s;ion.</P>

<P>The Grand Vizier (as we have &s;aid) <MILESTONE N="1683"> be|ing arrived at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> where he attended the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Troops, and with him Count <HI>Albert Caprara</HI> the Emperor's Re&s;ident, (whom he re&s;erved according to antient Cu&s;tom in the Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Ca|para</HI> licen|&s;ed to re|turn to <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE>) for an in&s;trument to move and forward Treaties, in ca&s;e any &s;ini&s;ter &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould befal the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Forces: But this Vizier fearing nothing le&s;s than ill fortune, and repo&s;ing a confidence in his Arm of Fle&s;h, which he thought im|po&s;&s;ible to be &s;ubdued, did ea&s;ily and with &s;ome &s;corn comply with the in&s;tance which Count <HI>Albert Caprara</HI> made to him for Licence to return to his Ma&s;ter at <HI>Vienna:</HI> And in order thereunto he was committed to the care, and conduct of the <HI>Bei</HI> of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> who was then Marching with his Men towards tho&s;e parts.

<P>Tho' <HI>C.

<P>The Report of this formidable, and as to human Appearance, invincible Army, cau|&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> to ha&s;ten with all &s;peed po&s;&s;ible the Fortifications of <HI>Raab,</HI> which he de&s;igned to enlarge on &s;ome ri&s;ing Grounds near to the Town, and to defend them with the whole Body of the Army, or at lea&s;t by the Infantry, which having a Communication with the Garri&s;on, might be able to oppo&s;e that great force of the Enemy, and weary them out by a lingring Siege in a Country, which was already be|come de&s;olate, and without Forage for a|bove twenty Miles round.</P>
<P>But the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> having received Intelligence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier at <HI>Alba Re|galis.</HI></NOTE> that the Grand Vizier on the 1&s;t. of <HI>July</HI> was entred into <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and certainly re&s;olved to Be&s;iege <HI>Vienna,</HI> and to &s;top at no other place on their March thi|ther; He then changed his Mea&s;ures, and having reinforced <HI>Raab,</HI> with the three Re|giments of <HI>Baden, Grana</HI> and <HI>Souches,</HI> and given the command of the Place to Colo|nel <HI>Wallis;</HI> and having al&s;o reinforced <HI>Comor|ra</HI> and other Places with &s;trong Garri&s;ons, his whole Field-Army became reduced unto 24.000 Men only: And fearing le&s;t with &s;o &s;mall a number, he &s;hould be &s;urrounded by the multitudes of the Enemy, he once re&s;olved to encamp him&s;elf under the Can|non of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Tekeli</HI> having made a Vi&s;it to the Grand Vizier in his Camp at <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> per&s;waded him to publi&s;h a Manife&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He publi&s;h|es a Mani|fe&s;t.</NOTE> &s;ignifying unto the People, That the Grand Seignior did take under his Pro|tection all the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> who &s;hould joyn them&s;elves to the Male-contented Party, and that he would maintain them in their Priviledges, Liberties, E&s;tates, Laws, and Religion: And that &s;uch, who refu&s;ed to accept this gracious Offer, were to expect no Quarter, but to be puni&s;hed with Fire and Sword. This Manife&s;t being divulged by <HI>Tekeli</HI> at his return from the Vizier to <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> &s;o operated on many of the <HI>Hun|garians,</HI> that the Towns of <HI>Papa, Tot</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;prin</HI> accepted of the &s;ame, and opened their Gate to <HI>Tekeli</HI> and his Party: And &s;uch was the Con&s;ternation of all <HI>Hungary,</HI> that many other Counties and Towns, declared to the Emperor's Commi&s;&s;ioners, that they would open their Gates to <HI>Tekeli</HI> at the fir&s;t Summons, rather than expo&s;e them&s;elves to Fire and Sword, where was no hopes or ex|pectations of Relief. This Declaration of the People, giving the Emperor ju&s;t cau&s;e to fear, le&s;t <HI>Neutra</HI> and the Mountain Towns &s;hould follow the &s;ame Example, Orders were given to Count <HI>Schultz,</HI> Governour of <HI>Neutra,</HI> to demoli&s;h that Fortre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neutra <HI>de|moli&s;hed.</HI></NOTE> and bring the gro&s;s Cannon, with all the Ammunition from thence; and the like Command was given to the Officers of the Mountain Towns, where the Mines of Silver were, it being impo&s;&s;ible to relieve them, becau&s;e <HI>Tekeli</HI> was Ma&s;ter of all the Pa&s;&s;es which led thither; which Orders were readily o|beyed by the Officers, Prie&s;ts and Religious Men, who fled to the Camp of General <HI>Schultz</HI> on the Banks of the River <HI>Waagh:</HI> Where <HI>Schultz</HI> having joyned with the &s;ix Thou&s;and <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, under the Command of Prince <HI>Lubomiski,</HI> he had the fortune to meet a Party of the Malecontents joyned with &s;ome <HI>Tartars,</HI> and to give them a total Defeat, killing and taking two Thou|&s;and of them, with &s;everal Colours, and all their Baggage.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while&s;t the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> was in this dubious Condition, not knowing what cour&s;e was be&s;t to be taken, he re&s;olved once to retire under the Cannon of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and there to go|vern him&s;elf according to the Motion of the Enemy; but the <HI>Turks</HI> came on &s;o fa&s;t, their Van appearing on the Banks of the River <HI>Raab,</HI> followed by the whole Body of their Army Marching in Bata|lia, that there was no time for any thing but a Precipitous Flight; nothing was now to be put to a hazard, for the lea&s;t Defeat might cau&s;e the ab&s;olute lo&s;s of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and open the Enemies way into the Hereditary Counties. In this exigency, all the Foot was Tran&s;ported over into the I&s;land of <HI>Schultz,</HI> under the Command of the Count <HI>de Zely;</HI> and all the Hor&s;e being about Nine thou&s;and five hundred in num|ber, Marched away about Midnight, and pitched their Camp near to <HI>Altembourg.</HI> The Infantry being in the I&s;le of <HI>Schultz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri|&s;tian In|fantry in the I&s;le of <HI>Schultz.</HI></NOTE> Marched without danger of the Enemy, and were in the way either to Communi|cate with <HI>Raab,</HI> or to give Succour to <HI>Vienna,</HI> according as they &s;aw the Enemy bend their Cour&s;e, for they were in a Condition to move fa&s;ter than the multi|tudes, and gro&s;s Bodies of the <HI>Turks.</HI> In a few Days it appear'd, that the <HI>Turks</HI> aimed at the Capital City of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and to leave all the other Fortre&s;&s;es behind them, as being places which would fall of them|&s;elves, and follow the Fate of the Imperial Court. The News of all which being carried from the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> by Count <HI>Caprara</HI> to the Emperor; and al&s;o, that the Baggage of the Duke of <HI>Saxelawenburg,</HI> of Prince <HI>Lewis de Baden,</HI> and of the Counts <HI>Caprara,</HI> and <HI>Montecuculi</HI> were all taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and their Convoy defeated; and that the
<PB N="101" REF="59"> Hor&s;e in great di&s;order had abandoned the Infantry, and left them to &s;hift for them&s;elves in the I&s;le of <HI>Schultz,</HI> and were Marching with great Di&s;order to <HI>Vienna:</HI> No &s;ooner was this Intelligence arrived, than the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> appear'd at the &s;ame time within two Leagues of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great con&s;terna|tion at <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE> and &s;et Fire to all the Villages round about, the Smoak of which a&s;cending upwards, gave vi&s;ible demon&s;tra|tions of the truth of the&s;e Reports, and put all the Court and City into a di&s;tracted Con&s;ternation. The Emperor after the com|ing of this News, made no delay to de|part away with the Empre&s;s, the Arch-Duche&s;s, and all the Court for <HI>Lintz:</HI> There was now no time to &s;pare; and Fear added Wings as well to the Poor as to the Rich; the great Per&s;onages who&s;e Offices obliged them to an attendance on the Court, were to be excu&s;ed from remaining behind in Defence of the City, the Duty they owed their Ma&s;ter di&s;engaging them from &s;how|ing their Bravery in the Face of the Enemy: And indeed &s;uch were the Preparations of all &s;orts of People to ha&s;ten out of the Town, as if none had intended to &s;tay in Defence of it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror and Court re|move to <HI>Lintz.</HI></NOTE> The Court which at other times would have requir'd at lea&s;t fifteen Days preparations for &s;uch a removal, was now con&s;ined to five or &s;ix Hours; &s;o that without a larger De&s;cription of this Affright|ment, we may imagin and figure to our &s;elves, the Confu&s;ion there was in <HI>Vienna</HI> upon this Departure. Every Man before he could leave his Home, had &s;omething or other to order and di&s;patch; for which Rea&s;on the Emperor at Night had very few, or none to &s;erve and attend him; and what will be thought mo&s;t &s;trange in times here|after, he had no Guard, or Convoy to Defend his Per&s;on, through the many Perils and Hazards he was to pa&s;s, it being nece&s;&s;ary to leave all the Soldiery behind for Defence of the City. We may then conceive with what Terrour this &s;ad and trembling Court did travel, being continu|ally allarum'd by reports of <HI>Tartars,</HI> who had Plunder'd and Pillaged, and Burnt all the Parts round, the terrible Marks of which appear'd in the Night, and &s;erved by the Flames to direct them in their way: And had not the Providence of God, car|ried that rude and barbarous Nation into Parts more Remote, the Emperor and all his Court, with the Ladies, and Chief No|bility had fallen as a Prey into their rapa|cious Hands: But God having diverted &s;o great a mi&s;chief and &s;hame to all Chri&s;ten|dom, the Imperial Court arrived at <HI>Lintz,</HI> more terrify'd with the continual Allarums, then tyred with the Journey; the Atten|dants followed the Court &s;o fa&s;t as they were able, as did the Women, Citizens, and tho&s;e who were not Men of the Sword; the ways were filled with Coaches, Carts, Waggons and Hor&s;es, the pre&s;ent trembling condition admini&s;tred unto the flying Multitude, matter of di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o that as they journied along their Talk was con|cerning the ill management of the publick Affairs, which were reduced to that un|happy State by the evil Councils of the Je&s;uits, who had too great an Intere&s;t, and prevailing Power in the Cabinet of the Emperor: Had it not been for them, &s;aid they, and for the Clergy, the Prote&s;tants had not been dive&s;ted of their Churches, nor deprived of their Liberties and Proper|ties, whereby they were provoked to take up Arms again&s;t the Emperor: Nay, how often was the Imperial Clemency well inclined to grant Pardon, and Terms of Peace to <HI>Te|keli,</HI> and his Malecontented Subjects; which would have diverted this Storm from the <HI>Turks,</HI> which now pur&s;ues us, but that the governing power of the Clergy &s;till cheri&s;hed, and fomented the Differences, until they had brought them to this ulti|mate precipice of our De&s;truction? Some there were, who being well di&s;po&s;ed to|wards the <HI>French</HI> Faction, blamed the Councils of the Emperor, for not accept|ing the Propo&s;itions of <HI>France</HI> made for re|lief of the Empire: For th&ocirc; &s;uch a remedy might be dangerous, yet it could not be wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e, nor nothing &s;o had as the pre&s;ent impending Evil; it were bet|ter to put our &s;elves into the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> than into the power of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>The Court continued not long at <HI>Lintz;</HI> for &s;o &s;oon as Intelligence came that <HI>Vienna</HI> was Be&s;ieged, the Emperor remo|ved to <HI>Pa&s;&s;au,</HI> which is a City about 30 or 40 Miles farther into <HI>Germany;</HI> and was a Bi&s;hoprick, which with <HI>Strasbourg</HI> was once in the Hands of the Arch Duke <HI>Leo|pold William.</HI> Two days after the depar|ture of the Emperor from <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Con|fu&s;ion &s;till continued day and night, cau&s;ed by Carts and Hor&s;es, employ'd to carry away the Goods and Hou&s;hold&s;tuff of tho&s;e who as u&s;ele&s;s Per&s;ons were permitted to remove out of the City.</P>
<P>At length, upon arrival of the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> the Confu&s;ion cea&s;ed, and the In|habitants and Soldiers affrightned before by the timorous multitude which were fled, began to return again into their Wits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Or|ders and Rules e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</NOTE> and become capable to receive Orders, and &s;olid Councils for the better defence of their City, E&s;tates and Lives.

<P>To the&s;e Summons no other An&s;wer was Return'd, than by Cannon and a Vigorous Defence, and by a Bloody Conflict in the Suburbs in which the <HI>Turks</HI> were greatly wor&s;ted. The Courage of the Be&s;ieged, which was evidenced during all the time of the Siege was mo&s;t eminently Signaliz'd at the beginning thereof; when the <HI>Scotch</HI> Convent of Benedictin Fryers, (which was a very &s;tately Edifice) took Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fire in <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE> and endangered the Ar&s;enal, which was near adjoyning thereunto, and where Two thou&s;and Barrels of Powder were lodged; but by the diligence of Young <HI>Staremberg,</HI> and the Officers of the Artillery, the Powder was all carried to &s;ome Remoter place: And it plea&s;ing God by his Gracious Providence, to cau&s;e the Wind to blow the Flames to o|ther Quarters, the Ar&s;enal was pre&s;erved and all the Ammunition therein, tho' &s;ever|al great Edifices, and Palaces thereunto adjoyning were con&s;umed before the Fire was extingui&s;hed. The Original of this Fire was attributed to the Treachery of a Youth of 16 Years of Age habited in Girls Cloathing; whom the People in their Fury tearing to pieces, prevented the Di&s;covery of this Treacherous and Horrid Plot. The <HI>Turks</HI> all this while with much Joy beheld the Flames a&s;cending from the City, and ply'd their Cannon and Bombs towards that part, which at fir&s;t broke in the Air without other Execution; and the better to prevent the accident by Fire, Count <HI>Sta|remberg</HI> order'd the Roofs off all tho&s;e Hou&s;es to be taken off which were cover'd with Shingles, and apt to take Fire with the lea&s;t Spark. This was a terrible beginning of a Siege, and &s;uch as was &s;ufficient to|tally to di&s;may the Spirits of the Defen|dants, but that they were &s;upported with more than ordinary Courage in&s;pired into them by the Providence of Heaven.</P>
<P>All this while the Cavalry maintained their Stations at the Foot of the Bridges, to keep a Communication &s;o long as was po&s;&s;ible with the Town, and hinder the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Turks</HI> into the I&s;les of <HI>Leo|pol&s;tadt,</HI> the which Action the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> committed to the Care and Con|duct of General <HI>Schultz,</HI> and Prince <HI>Lubo|miski,</HI> while&s;t he with the greater part of the Army retir'd to <HI>Langenzendorf:</HI> But the <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> with a very great num|ber coming to force the Pa&s;s, carrying the Foot on their Hor&s;es behind them, and Wading over the Water, which was Foard|able on all &s;ides, were received with &s;uch

<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> having by this time encompa&s;|&s;ed the whole City with their numerous Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> batter the City.</NOTE> and Tents of diver&s;e colours, ad|vanced their Trenches within thirty Paces of the Counter&s;carp, on the &s;ide of the Ba|&s;tions of the Court and the Lobel, and con|tinually &s;o plyed that Quarter with their Cannons and Morters, that they entirely ruined the Emperor's Palace, with the Hou|&s;es and Churches thereunto adjoyning.

<P>Whil&s;t Matters were thus acting in the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. <HI>Le&s;lie</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Krembs.</HI></NOTE> Count <HI>Le&s;lie</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Krembs</HI> to convoy the Train of Artillery thither, and attend the coming of the Auxiliary Troops of <HI>Bavaria, Saxony</HI> and <HI>Franconia,</HI> and the Regiments which were marching from &s;eve|ral other Places of the Empire; and al&s;o to re&s;train the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Tartars</HI> into <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who with much Violence and Cru|elty laid all Places, where&s;oever they came, in Bloud and A&s;hes, th&ocirc; many of them were cut to pieces in divers Conflicts, there being a Hundred and fifty of them killed by the Pea&s;ants, who were felling the Trees about <HI>Vienna,</HI> to hinder and di&s;turb the March of the Enemy.

Some Troops be|longing to General <HI>Schultz</HI> had the fortune at the &s;ame time to take a con&s;iderable Con|voy of the <HI>Turks,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of above three Hundred Waggons, killing on the place about &s;ix Hundred and fifty, and taking two Hundred Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> had drawn two parallel Lines, one on the &s;ide of the Court-Ba&s;tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Turki&s;h Force.</NOTE> and another on the Lobel-Ba&s;tion, with a Line of Communication between both; and here they rai&s;ed their Batteris of thirty Pie|ces of Cannon: And th&ocirc; <HI>Vienna</HI> was fortifi|ed with eleven Ba&s;tions, yet three of them only were attacked, &s;o that the whole Force of the Town was drawn that way for its Defence.

<P>The 25th. of this Month, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> receiving Intelligence, that <HI>Tekeli</HI> had formed an Army of 20 .000 Malecon|tents, and eight Thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> under the Command of the Pa&s;has of <HI>Waradin</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> and de&s;igned to Be&s;iege the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Presburg;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates a|bout the Relief of <HI>Presbourg.</HI></NOTE> which being a Place of con&s;ider|able Con&s;equence, was a Matter of long Debate, whether in that Conjuncture it was to be relieved in de&s;pight of all the Difficul|ties and Ob&s;tacles which appeared to the contrary. For in the fir&s;t place it was al|ledged, that the Ways thither were rocky, woody, and inclo&s;ed, that the Forces of the Enemy were much &s;uperior to theirs in num|ber; and that the Army ought not to be put into any hazard of being Defeated, at a time when the Relief of <HI>Vienna</HI> was the main and ultimate De&s;ign. To the&s;e Argu|ments it was urged, that in ca&s;e the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Presburg</HI> was &s;urrendred to the Enemy, it would facilitate a Communication between their two Armies, and hinder the conjuncti|on of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army with the Imperial, unle&s;s they took a large compa&s;s about, which would both harra&s;s the Men by a long March, and defer the Relief of <HI>Vienna;</HI> the Extremities of which required nothing more than Ha&s;t and a &s;peedy Succour.

In the Night Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> and the Baron of <HI>Merci,</HI> were Commanded in the Van to &s;ecure the narrow Ways and Pa&s;&s;ages; and being come upon certain Hills, where they &s;ee round about, they di&s;covered the Enemies Fires and Lights below in the Plains, and two Camps at &s;ome little di&s;tance one from the other; of which, Advice being given to the General, Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> was or|dered to Attack the Suburbs of <HI>Presbourg,</HI> where &s;ome of the Malecontents were quar|tered; upon this Surpri&s;e, the Malecontents flying into the Town, made way for the Imperiali&s;ts to enter without much Re&s;i|&s;tance: The City being in a &s;uddain con&s;ter|nation, upon &s;ight of the Imperial Army at their Gates, &s;urrendred upon Summons, as did al&s;o the Ca&s;tle; the Garri&s;on where|of, whil&s;t the Town was in Treaty, e&s;ca|ped out to &s;eek for Refuge in the Camp; but many of them were intercepted in their Pa&s;&s;age, and cut to pieces.</P>
<P>This happy &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ight of the E|nemy was an evidence of their Weakne&s;s and want of Courage, and animated the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to give them Battle: The Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> with his Dragoons, was hereupon as ordered, drew up in the Vine|yards and Gardens adjoyning to the Su|burbs, and extended his whole Body to the right and left, along the <HI>Danube</HI> to the foot of the Hill, the better to &s;ecure <HI>C.

<P>The Enemy made a &s;how as if they in|tended to fight, and detached &s;ome Parties to begin a Skirmi&s;h, but the Duke of <HI>Lo|raine</HI> would not Engage, until all his Forces were drawn up; upon appearance whereof the Malecontents changed their Minds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Male|contents are put to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> and in&s;tead of advancing, the Imperiali&s;ts per+ceived, by a great Du&s;t ri&s;ing on one &s;ide

How&s;oever, this Acti|on was not performed without &s;ome lo&s;s and hurt to the Be&s;ieged, for Count <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Staremberg</HI> and Count <HI>Souches</HI> were wound|ed: <HI>George Mi&s;nier,</HI> General of the Artillery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several of the <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> killed.</NOTE> had his Arm broken by a Shot, of which he died in a few days afterwards, to the great Sorrow of the whole City, which could not but mi&s;s a Per&s;on &s;o excellent in his Art, having been Ingenier at the Siege of <HI>Philipsbourg,</HI> in the Troops of the Mar|que&s;s of <HI>Baden:</HI> In this Action al&s;o were killed Baron <HI>Walter,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and <HI>William Schemnitz,</HI> a Captain in the Regiment of <HI>Staremberg;</HI> as al&s;o Baron <HI>Dubski,</HI> who was &s;hot through both his Buttocks with a Mu&s;|quet Bullet; and the Governour, <HI>Starem|berg</HI> him&s;elf, was again wounded in the Hand with the &s;troak of a Stone, as he had before been in the Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> having this Day intercepted a Letter, which the Governour had &s;ent by an expre&s;s Me&s;&s;enger to the Duke of <HI>Lo|raine,</HI> to give an account of the &s;tate of the Town; the Vizier, that he might give no|tice thereof unto <HI>Staremberg,</HI> he cau&s;ed the &s;ame Paper to be fa&s;tned to an Arrow, and &s;hot into the Town, with an additional Letter from the Vizier, wrote in <HI>Latin</HI> to this Effect: <HI>That it was to little purpo&s;e for the Be&s;ieged to write in Characters unto the Duke of</HI> Lo|raine <HI>to render him an account of the ill Con|dition of their Town,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter &s;hot into the Town.</NOTE> <HI>&s;ince the &s;ame is &s;uffi|ciently known to the Be&s;iegers, without any Key or Explanation of the Cypher.

<P>As the Be&s;ieged continued &s;till in good heart within the Town, &s;o the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI>'s Camp received a double Encou|ragement from two happy Succe&s;&s;es: The fir&s;t was, That the <HI>Bano,</HI> or Lord Lieute|nant of <HI>Croatia,</HI> had con&s;erved that People in their Loyalty and Devotion towards the Emperor, and for Security thereof, had made them to enter into a &s;olemn Oath: But that of a greater Importance, was, That General <HI>Dunewald</HI> had again defeated a Body of two or three Thou&s;and <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Body of <HI>Tartars</HI> de|feated.</NOTE> with the &s;laughter of about thirteen Hun|dred killed upon the place, and many Pri|&s;oners taken, be&s;ides all their Baggage and Booty which they had plunder'd in <HI>Hun|gary</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> Within the Town they were forming and contriving all Ways and

<P>The 28th. the <HI>Turks</HI> attempting to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Counter&s;carp, on the &s;ide of the Court-Ba&s;tion and Lobel, &s;prang a Mine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mine &s;prang by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> which they had prepared on that Quarter; but it being not far enough advanced, it reached not the Pali&s;adoes, how&s;oever, about twenty Soldiers were killed, be&s;ides &s;everal wounded.</P>

<P>On the 30th. Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> fired a Mine, which as believed did great executi|on on the Enemy, for that they employed the whole Day following in repairing the Damage which that Mine had cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t. the <HI>Turks</HI> advanced their Tren|ches &s;o near to the Counter&s;carp, that the two Parties could &s;peak and di&s;cour&s;e one with the other, and fight at Arms end, and with the Stakes of the Pali&s;adoes, which they had plucked up; but the Defendants with their long iron Crooks, &s;uch as we u&s;e for pulling down Hou&s;es, in the time of Fire, caught up the Bodies of Men, and drew them over the Walls, and with one cut of their Scyths would Mow off three or four Heads at a &s;troak.</P>

<P>The execution of the&s;e De&s;igns was de|ferred until the 7th. when the King towards the Evening began to pa&s;s the River, and was forthwith followed by the Duke of <HI>Lo|raine</HI> at the Head of the Imperial Army; having fir&s;t made a Detachment of three Regiments, which were to joyn with three Thou&s;and <HI>Poles</HI> to cut off all Communication of the <HI>Turks</HI> and Malecontents, with the Vi|zier's Camp. Colonel <HI>Hei&s;ler</HI> with his Regi|ment of &s;ix Hundred Hor&s;e was ordered to take his March by the way of <HI>Clo&s;&s;en-neu|burg,</HI> and to make Fires upon the Hills of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> to give notice unto the Be&s;ieged of their approaching Relief, which was the Signal agreed between them. But before we come to this glorious Atchievement, let us &s;ee what was acting for Defence of the Town, and Difficulties to which the Be&s;ie|ged were reduced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 2.</NOTE>In the Morning of this &s;econd day, the Point of the Court-Ba&s;tion was overthrown, which gave the <HI>Turks</HI> occa&s;ion to carry their Galleries farther, to the utter ruin of that Fort. Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> believing that the re|maining part of the Ba&s;tion could not be longer defended, gave Order to <HI>Huiternian,</HI> a Captain of his Regiment, who&s;e turn it was to mount the Guard that Night, to a|bandon the Ravelin in ca&s;e he found him|&s;elf over-pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and un|der covert of the dark Night to make his Retreat. But this &s;tout Captain having taken this Po&s;t with fifty Men, &s;o bravely defended the remains of the tottering For|tre&s;s, that th&ocirc; the <HI>Turks</HI> burnt the Pali|&s;adoes which were his chief Fortification, yet he repul&s;ed them by the Fire of his Mu|&s;quets, with lo&s;s of twenty of his Men, and remained on the place until the Morn|ing, having killed two <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> with his own Hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3d.</NOTE>Next day the Governour finding it im|po&s;&s;ible to maintain that Po&s;t any longer, gave order to the Guards to retire, and abandon it to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had little more to boa&s;t of, than the ac|qui&s;t of that Ravelin, after an Attempt of &s;ix Weeks continuance made thereupon.</P>
<P>The fourth was a bloudy day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th.</NOTE> both to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and to the <HI>Turks;</HI> for the latter had &s;prung a Mine under the Court-Bulwark, which not only opened a Breach of &s;even Geometrical Paces, but &s;hook the whole City with the violent concu&s;&s;ion of the Air. Five thou&s;and <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A bloudy Fight.</NOTE> immediately with Ce|myters in their Hands, mounted the Breach, and &s;heltring them&s;elves under &s;ome Sacks of Wool, which they carried before them, they mounted the Breach with their Cries, <HI>Allah, Allah,</HI> and planted four of their Stan|dards thereupon. But not with&s;tanding all this Fury of the <HI>Turks,</HI> they were repul&s;ed with equal Bravery by the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> The Fight continued the whole day, in which the Ge|nerals, Captains, and common Soldiers per|formed the Offices and Parts of valiant and &s;tout Defendants, who fearle&s;s of the Ene|mies Cannon, &s;mall Shot, Bombs, Grana|does and Mines, th&ocirc; twenty of them were killed that day by one Bomb, and thirty by the Mine, yet &s;till they remained re&s;olute not to grant one Palm of Ground to the E|nemy; but what they gained with the Lives of thou&s;ands. The <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> lo&s;t in this day's Conflict one Hundred fifty four common Soldiers, be&s;ides &s;ome Officers; but this Lo&s;s was recompen&s;ed with the &s;laughter of twelve Hundred <HI>Turks,</HI> who&s;e Bodies filled up the Ditch, among&s;t which 'twas believed that diver&s;e were Men of Quality, becau&s;e their Corp&s;e were carried off with much diligence and hazard by tho&s;e, who attend|ed them at their fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks,</HI> enraged with the&s;e Repul&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th.</NOTE> fired their Batteries ince&s;&s;antly again&s;t the Walls of the Town; and towards the Even|ing a terrible Fight began in the Ditch, at the foot of the Court-Ba&s;tion near the Breach, in which the <HI>Turks</HI> were beaten off with much Bravery by the Defendants, who not only repaired the Breach, but retrench|ed them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly, that the <HI>Turks</HI> dur&s;t attempt them no more on that &s;ide. This day Arms were given into the Hands of four Hundred Inhabitants, who had not as yet been engaged on the Walls, having been employed in other Services.</P>
<P>On the 6th. the <HI>Turks</HI> fired two Mines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th&punc;</NOTE> one of which was under the Lobel-Ba&s;tion, and being extreamly deep, it over-threw a great part of the Wall, opened a Breach of nine Paces wide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mine fired.</NOTE> and blew up twenty four of the Defendants. How&s;oever, the <HI>Turks</HI> did not immediately proceed to an A&s;&s;ault, becau&s;e the Mines had thrown up &s;uch va&s;t quanti|ties of Stones and Earth, as had almo&s;t fil|led
<PB N="116" REF="68"> up their Trenches, and buried many of their Soldiers. How&s;oever, having breath|ed and con&s;idered a while, they advanced to an A&s;&s;ault with their u&s;ual Multitudes, which continued for two Hours; till at length the <HI>Turks</HI> finding it impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vail, with-drew from the Breach, and fled with &s;uch fear, that not regarding the way they took to avoid the Enemies Shot, many of them came within reach of the Ravelin, called <HI>Molk;</HI> where they were &s;o received by Cannon and Granadoes, filled with Nails and old Iron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two thou|&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> killed.</NOTE> and by &s;mall Shot from be|hind a Redoubt placed in the Ditch, that whole Chambers of <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> were de&s;troy|ed in the Fight, and greater numbers killed than had been in any of the A&s;&s;aults; the Lo&s;s having been computed at the lea&s;t two Thou&s;and Men. With this Succe&s;s, and with the daily hopes and expectations of Relief, the Spirits of the Defendants were rai&s;ed and exalted; as the Courages of the Enemy, with the many Slaughters &s;u&s;tained in the Siege, and apprehen&s;ions of the ap|proach of a va&s;t and formidable Army a|gain&s;t them began to abate and decline. And as a fore-runner of the expected Suc|cour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signals of the Suc|cours com|ing.</NOTE> five Rockets were di&s;covered that Even|ing in the Air, from the Mountain of <HI>Kalem|berg,</HI> which was the Signal agreed upon in that ca&s;e; and as a Token, that they were &s;o under&s;tood by the Town, five Rockets more from the top of St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Steeple were returned in an&s;wer. This day was the la&s;t that the <HI>Turks</HI> made their fierce&s;t Attacks, being well a&s;&s;ured, that what was not then obtained could not afterwards be effected, but by a total defeat of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> For|ces; &s;o that the Vizier did little more the day following being the 7th, than continue their Batteries without hope of much execution; and expecting every day to be A&s;&s;aulted by an Army not much inferiour to his own, he drew out his Troops to take a review of them, and to &s;ee in what Condition they were to encounter &s;o formidable an Enemy. The Army being drawn out, every <HI>Begler|beg, Pa&s;ha</HI> or <HI>Sangiac</HI> gave in a Li&s;t of the Men which remained under his Command; the numbers of which being ca&s;t up into one total Sum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the <HI>Turk's</HI> Forces.</NOTE> amounted unto One hundred &s;ixty and eight thou&s;and Men; which prob|ably might have been the full account of the whole Army, when they fir&s;t &s;urrounded the Walls of <HI>Vienna:</HI> Afterwards during the Siege, tho&s;e which were &s;lain or died by Sickne&s;s were computed at Forty eight thou&s;and five hundred and forty four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What were killed at the Siege.</NOTE> as appeared by a Li&s;t found in the Grand Vi|zier's Tent after the Siege was rai&s;ed; &s;o that then the Turki&s;h Army was reduced unto One hundred and nineteen thou&s;and four hundred and fifty &s;ix fighting Men, be&s;ides Camel-drivers and Attendants on the Camp; and with this va&s;t Force the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hame|fully turned their Backs and Fled, as we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee in a few days follow|ing.</P>
<P>On the 8th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th.</NOTE> there was an appearance of Smoak a&s;cending from Mount <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> which gave an undoubted a&s;&s;urance to the Be&s;ieged, of the approach of &s;ome advan|ced Troops de&s;igned for their Relief: And with this joyful Spectacle the Defendants beheld the <HI>Turks</HI> loading their Camels, and preparing to pack away with their Bag|gage. How&s;oever, they continued &s;till to fire great quantities of Bombs, and Grana|does into the Town, and to dig their Mines; one of which they fired this day under the Ba&s;tion of the Lobel: By which they blew up part of the Wall, which as believed would be &s;econded by a General A&s;&s;ault; and accordingly expected by the Defendants, who in fear thereof remain'd all day in Arms on their Guard, and with them the Regiment of Hor&s;e commanded by <HI>Dupigni,</HI> all &s;erving on Foot, armed with their Helmets and Coats of Mail; but in|&s;tead hereof the <HI>Turks</HI> only made a &s;mall Attempt with about Three hundred Men, with which they had the fortune to beat the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> out of the Trenches of the Pali|&s;adoes, which united the Communication between the Lobel and Town: But <HI>Santa Croce,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Dupigni,</HI> with Fifty of his Regiment, armed as afore&s;aid, coming in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, repul&s;ed the <HI>Turks</HI> from tho&s;e Trenches, and again po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves thereof: In which Action the Lieutenant Colonel was wounded in the Leg, as was al&s;o one of his Captains called <HI>Grove,</HI> and Sixteen of his Souldiers killed and wounded, be&s;ides Twenty five Foot Sol|diers belonging to other Regiments; but &s;till good fortune &s;o favoured them, that they met with a Mine of the Enemy fur|ni&s;hed with Twenty eight Barrils of Pow|der, which was ready to have been fired that Night, had they di&s;charged it, and filled the vacancy again with Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> having News of the near ap|proach of Relief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th.</NOTE> re&s;olved to make their ultimate Effort on the Town, which they thought was now reduced to the la&s;t Ga&s;p and Extremity, and that they mu&s;t carry it now or never: Upon which accordingly they fired their Cannon, and Mortars double to what they had done on other days: But this was but like a lightning (as they &s;ay) before Death; for pre&s;ently in the Af|ternoon the Turki&s;h Camp began to move, and their Cavalry to Ride from one &s;ide to another in a confu&s;ed manner: Their Ser|vants and Attendants were taking down their Tents, and loading their Camels with
<PB N="117" REF="68"> their Baggage; all which was in order to the removal of their Camp, and pitching it in another place more commodious for Engagement, and Fighting with the Enemy. How&s;oever, tho&s;e who were left behind to &s;ecure the Trenches, and make good the Siege, &s;till proceeded in their Subterranean Works, and this day fired nine &s;everal Mines under the Curtain, which was be|tween the Court and Lobel Ba&s;tion, without much execution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10th.</NOTE>On the 10th, a Di&s;covery was made of three other Mines, which the Enemy had opened under the Curtain between the &s;aid Ba&s;tions; to defend which, all the Cannon on that &s;ide were brought to that place, and behind them &s;o many Trenchments, Retrenchments and Pali&s;adoes were made and erected, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the Enemy to advance ten Paces, with|out meeting &s;ome difficult Pa&s;s, or Fortifi|cation to overcome: And indeed the <HI>Turks</HI> had already found by good experience, that one &s;pan of Earth had co&s;t them the lives of a Thou&s;and Men to purcha&s;e it. Not|with&s;tanding which the place was reduced to its la&s;t extremity, and to a &s;en&s;ible want of all Provi&s;ions and Ammunition; and no|thing could keep up their Courage and Re|&s;olution, but the hourly expectation of Relief, which they &s;ignified to the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> by the continual firing of Rockets and other Fire-works; giving him thereby to under&s;tand that the Town was in it's la&s;t Agony, and the &s;aving thereof, and of all their Lives depended only on &s;ome few Moments of time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11th.</NOTE>On the 11th, the <HI>Turks</HI> plied their Can|non and Mortar-pieces, as violent as at any time before, tho' the Fury of them con|tinued not above three Hours; for the noi&s;e of the approach of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army be|gan to &s;ilence the Roaring of Cannon, and turned their Thoughts from the offen&s;ive part, to a care of providing for their own &s;ecurity. In the Afternoon appeared three &s;everal Smoaks on the Mount of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> which was the certain Signal of the approach|ing Succour; at the &s;ight of which, the Defendants full of Hopes and Courage, prepared to make a Sally on the Enemy: The People full of Joy run to the Ramparts which were lea&s;t expo&s;ed to danger; the Women and others who were Feeble and Sickly left their Beds, and betook them|&s;elves to the Tops of Hou&s;es, to behold the plea&s;ant Spectacle of their long de&s;ired de|liverance; &s;ome of which were &s;till de&s;pond|ing with fear, and conceiving that the nu|merous Troops of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o Valiant, and &s;o well Intrenched were almo&s;t invincible: Others pre&s;aged &s;ome wonderful Slaughter to in&s;ue; others of more &s;anguine and chear+ful Temperament, beheld the <HI>Turks</HI> as lo&s;t, and figured unto them&s;elves their &s;hameful and ignominious Flight. In &s;hort, all Peo|ple were full of Prayers and Vows to his Divine Maje&s;ty, that he would be plea&s;ed at length to Re&s;cue, and deliver them from the many Dangers with which they were encompa&s;&s;ed: Their Prayers were heard, and towards five a Clock in the Evening, &s;ome advanced Troops appeared on the Moun|tain near the Mona&s;tery and Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Leopold,</HI> between whom and the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ome Shot were exchanged; but Night coming on, the darkne&s;s put an end unto a far|ther Engagement, which was re&s;erved for the day following.</P>
<P>This being the day appointed by Heaven for Relief of this expiring City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th.</NOTE> which could not have held out twenty four Hours long|er, the Imperial and Poli&s;h Army with the Auxiliaries joyned at the Foot of the Moun|tain of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> which before the Armies began to a&s;cend, it was judged fit in the fir&s;t place to take a Survey of the Ground, and the &s;everal Po&s;ts therein. The Marquis <HI>Parella,</HI> a Gentleman of illu&s;trious Birth and clear Courage, repre&s;ented the Ground in an exact Map to the Generals, and of|fer'd with his own Per&s;on and Followers to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the Ca&s;tle <HI>Leopold,</HI> and the Mona&s;tery, which were very advantagi|ous Po&s;ts on this occa&s;ion. The Enterpri&s;e &s;eemed &s;o hazardous to the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> that he commended the generous offer, which the Marquis had made, but judging it a more fit undertaking for Soldiers of le&s;s note, he drew out a Party of Sixty Grana|diers under the command of a Lieutenant, to whom he committed this dangerous Service: The Duke having al&s;o in Per&s;on by night taken a more exact Survey of the place, and judging it to be of great impor|tance, reinforced it with Three hundred Soldiers more; after which he returned back to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> to inform him of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Army. After which all the Forces were ranged in form of Bat|tail, and began to March over the Moun|tain of <HI>Kalemberg:</HI> The utmo&s;t part of the right Wing was committed to the Conduct of the King of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>

The Infantry of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Franconia</HI> were drawn up in the third place or middle, Commanded by Prince <HI>Wal|deck;</HI> near unto whom all that day was the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who pretended to &s;erve as a Volontier, it being his fir&s;t expedition in the War. All the Emperor's Foot, and that of <HI>Saxony</HI> commanded by Prince <HI>Herman</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> were drawn up on the left Hand, and Marched directly along the <HI>Danube,</HI> and towards the Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Leopold.</HI> Next to the&s;e on the left Wing marched Count <HI>Caprara</HI> with &s;even Regiments of the Emperor's Hor&s;e, to which the <HI>Poles,</HI> under <HI>Lubomiski</HI> were joyn'd, with all the Caval|ry and Dragoons of <HI>Saxony,</HI> commanded by the Elector him&s;elf in Per&s;on. In this Or|der the Army mounted the Hill, with a &s;low pace, to attend the Motion of the Ar|tillery, which th&ocirc; con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall Pieces; yet the Ways were &s;o Rough and Rocky, that with double Teams of Hor&s;es, they a&s;cended &s;lowly to the Top of the Hill. And now both Armies with opening of the Morning began to take a view of each o|ther:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tur|ki&s;h Camp opened.</NOTE> The Stars were not with drawn from the Sky, when the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> heard the <HI>Alah, Alah</HI> &s;ound from the Turki&s;h Camp, which are the Lauds or Prai&s;es which they &s;ing to God in their Prayers. The Fires and Lights in their Camp di&s;cover'd the excellent &s;ymetry, and order in the di&s;|po&s;ition of their Tents and Troops; which had been the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Spectacle in the World, had it not been of Enemies and In|fidels, who came to de&s;troy the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the <HI>German</HI> Empire. From hence it was that the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> taking a view of the Enemies Forces, did conceive that the or|ders in which they were placed, did look as if they intended to di&s;pute every Foot of Ground between each Army; which they might have done with great advantage, in ca&s;e they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Woods in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and of Am|bu&s;cades, which according to the nature of the Ground might be pleaced to hinder the de&s;cent from the Mountain. Wherefore the King de&s;ired of the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> Two thou&s;and <HI>German</HI> Foot to Flank his Hor&s;e at the entrance out of the Wood, and to &s;up|port them in the de&s;cent down the Craggy Hill, and accordingly four Batalions were granted for that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> who was General of the Artillery, had received Orders to Rai&s;e a Battery at the coming out the Wood, for better &s;ecurity of the Army in their March over the Hill, which he almo&s;t effected with one nights work; but before he had quite fini&s;hed it, the <HI>Turks</HI> made a di&s;covery of what was there doing, and were put in mind thereby of what they them&s;elves &s;hould have done to impede the Enemies pa&s;&s;age that way: But certain it is, they were &s;o confident of their invincible &s;trength, that they thought it too mean for them to take the advantage of Po&s;ts, or Situations again&s;t an Army, of which they conceived &s;o low an E&s;teem: But finding them&s;elves at la&s;t deceived in tho&s;e imaginations and Coun|cils, they detached early in the Morning &s;ome Forces to demoli&s;h the Work, which Troops came very near, and po&s;ted them|&s;elves behind certain Trees which were felled, and Planks, which &s;erved for Barrica|does again&s;t the Shot of the Battery.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> ob&s;erving from the Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Leopol,</HI> the motion of the <HI>Turks</HI> again&s;t the advanced Troops, Ordered &s;everal Batalions under Command of the Duke of <HI>Croy</HI> to &s;upport them, which coming &s;ea&s;onably to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance cau&s;ed the Imperiali&s;ts to enlarge their Front in that Line, and gave them Re&s;olution to

<P>The whole Body of the Turki&s;h Army beginning now to move, the Duke of <HI>Lo|raine</HI> gave Orders to his left Wing to ad|vance, and to Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> and to Duke <HI>Saxelawemberg</HI> to Sally out of the Woods, and fall upon the Enemies Front at the Head of their Encampment. In the mean time the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was advanced as far as to the Chappel of St. <HI>Leopold,</HI> where he heard Ma&s;s with great Devotion, which was celebrated by Father <HI>Mark Aviano,</HI> a Capuchin and Confe&s;&s;or to the King, which being fini&s;hed, the Ble&s;&s;ing was given to him and all his Army: And then the King Cry'd with a loud Voice, <HI>Now we may March with entire a&s;&s;urance that God will give us Victory;</HI> And then mounting on Hor&s;e-back, he Road in among&s;t the Ranks of his Army, and made this Speech to them as follows.</P>

Behold there|fore your King, who Fights at the Head of your Battalions: And be confident that the God of Ho&s;ts, who&s;e Cau&s;e we are going to maintain, will Fight on our &s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>The Mountain of <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> and the Woods of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Vienna</HI> re&s;ounded by this time with the Ecchoes from the Peals of Cannon, and Vollies of &s;mall Shot, which called the Inhabitants of <HI>Vienna</HI> to the Tops of their Hou&s;es, and of the Ram|pires to behold the long wi&s;hed for Sight of their approaching deliverance: How|&s;oever they were not &s;o much taken up in &s;eeing, and admiring, as to neglect their Guards and Watches on their fortifications; but on the Contrary, they plied all their Cannon, Small &s;hot and Granadoes, again&s;t the Enemy in their Trenches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turke</HI> play with their Can|non on the Town.</NOTE> with much profu&s;ene&s;s, knowing that the time of their deliverance being come, they might the more lavi&s;hly be&s;tow their Ammunition on their Enemies: The like quantities of Cannon, Fire-works, Bombs, &amp;c. were returned from the <HI>Turks</HI> on the Town, and in greater a|bundance than had been at any time &s;ince the beginning of the Siege; and all the Mountains, Plains and Places round the City were filled Fire, Smoak and Noi&s;e: In the mean time the King of <HI>Poland</HI> con|tinued his March down the Hills, as did the Regiments of Dragoons of <HI>Hei&s;ler</HI> and of <HI>Saxony,</HI> which were po&s;ted on the left Wing, near the Chappel of St. <HI>Leopold:</HI> The like Orders were given to all the Imperial Army to advance towards the Enemy, who be|gan now to &s;helter them&s;elves under Rocks, and behind Trees, and in rough places: The right Wing al&s;o moved at the &s;ame time, and all with equal paces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> give ground.</NOTE> The <HI>Turks</HI> made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance as yet, but &s;o faintly as was not able to with&s;tand the Fury of the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and the &s;everal Shelters un|to which they began to have recour&s;e, &s;howed plainly their intentions to quit the Field. The Devotions which the King of <HI>Poland</HI> u&s;ed this Morning, retarded his March for the &s;pace of a full hour, during which the whole <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army made a Halt near to <HI>Neudorf,</HI> until the <HI>Poles</HI> were come up into the Line equal to the re&s;t of the For|ces. The left Wing of the Imperiali&s;ts without much re&s;i&s;tance, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of the Po&s;t which the <HI>Turks</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at <HI>Hol&s;tadt,</HI> and the Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> cau&s;ed the Enemy on the other &s;ide to give way. The appearance of the <HI>Poles</HI> on the Top and on the &s;ide of the Hill, looked very formidable to the <HI>Turks.</HI> The King, who marched at the Head of his Army, detach|ed &s;everal Troops of his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> to Skir|mi&s;h with the Front of the Enemy; but be|ing over-powred, were forced to Retire to a place where Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> had very &s;ea|&s;onably cau&s;ed &s;ome Batalions of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and of the Regiment of <HI>Merci</HI> to advance, which gave a &s;top to the pur&s;uit which the <HI>Turks</HI> made after them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> charge the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> The King upon this di&s;order of the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> cau&s;ed the fir&s;t Line of his Army to advance, which charged the <HI>Turks</HI> with &s;o much Fury, as cau&s;ed the Gro&s;s of their Body to Retire unto the Top of a Hill, where &s;ome of their Foot were drawn up, and &s;everal Batteries of Can|non planted. And now all the Poli&s;h Army moved, the Enemy oppo&s;ing them in di|vers &s;catter'd places, from whence they fired Vollies of Mu&s;quets, with much dam|age to the <HI>Poles;</HI> but as yet they were
<PB N="120" REF="70"> not broken, but &s;till advancing gained Ground on the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> being far advanced with the left Wing to|wards the Enemy; the <HI>Turks</HI> to avoid the Effort which was making on their Right, drew them&s;elves into Batalia before their Line of Circumvallation, and fortified them|&s;elves with &s;ome Pieces of Cannon, as if they intended to have made a &s;trong re&s;i|&s;tence; but their Re&s;olution continued not long before they gave way, and abandoning that Po&s;t, opened a way to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> into their Camp, without any oppo&s;ition. Then it was, that the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> com|manded all the left Wing to Wheel about unto the Right, taking in the whole com|pa&s;s of the Turki&s;h Camp, without break|ing their Ranks, or falling upon the Plun|der of the Enemies Baggage, or Tents which they had left Standing. The King of <HI>Po|land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Poland</HI> enters the Turki&s;h Camp.</NOTE> and Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> with their &s;everal Troops, enter'd the Turki&s;h Camp about &s;even a Clock in the Evening: And the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> about half an hour after made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Counter&s;carp, and Suburbs of the City; the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> who were lodged in tho&s;e Quarters e&s;caping by favour of the Night, with much le&s;s Slaughter than if it had been Day; and in|deed they behaved them&s;elves with much more Valour, than others of the Turki&s;h Militia: The Darkne&s;s put an end to the Battail, in which the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had gained a compleat and an undoubted Victory. And now the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> had lei&s;ure to &s;end to complement the King upon this fortunate Succe&s;s, a great part of which Glory, he attributed to the Valour and good Conduct of his Maje&s;ty and his gener|ous Cavaliers: The King returned an An|&s;wer on the other &s;ide, with like obliging expre&s;&s;ions, confe&s;&s;ing, that th&ocirc; every Na|tion and Battalion in the Army did their parts; yet much of the Honour of the Succe&s;s of this Day, was due to the Bra|very of the <HI>Germans,</HI> who were the fir&s;t to enter into the Camp and Trenches of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Thus were the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> become Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp, where they lodged that Night in the &s;ame Form and Order, as the <HI>Turks</HI> had done the Night before, with Fires and Lights in all the Tents; only it was a more grateful Spectacle to the Be|&s;ieged, which they could behold with more Comfort and Security, than ever they had done the Nights before; for this was of Joy, and the others of Terrour.</P>
<P>In the Night the <HI>Turks</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the River at <HI>Sweker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ha&s;ty Flight of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> with &s;o much Fear and Precipi|tation, that they not only left their whole Camp &s;tanding, but even the Standard of the Empire, which is the Sacred Banner of their Religion, with the three Hor&s;e Tails, which are the En&s;igns of the Vizier's Au|thority. Moreover, they abandoned to their Enemies all their Tents, Baggage, Am|munition and Provi&s;ions, with all their Can|non and Artillery, being One hundred and eighty Pieces; and &s;o &s;peedy were they in their Flight, that before the next Day in the Evening, the Van of their Army had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Raab.</HI></P>
<P>Next day early in the Morning Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> attended with his Son, and &s;e|veral of the principal Commanders of the City, went out to return Thanks to his Benefactors for &s;o great deliverance, and to Congratulate with them their Fortunate Succe&s;&s;es and Triumph, which would ap|pear Glorious over all the World: But the fir&s;t thing which the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> did that Morning by break of Day, was to Or|der all his Army to put them&s;elves into a readine&s;s to March, whil&s;t he con&s;ulted with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> how, and in what man|ner they might pur&s;ue the Enemy, and im|prove the Victory.

And now in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Camp, and in the City was time for Joy and Triumph. Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> having paid his Re&s;pects, and made his Complements to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> he conducted them into the City, with a numerous attendance of Nobility and Gentry, who had &s;erved in the late Siege; all the Forces were drawn up on both &s;ides of the Streets, between which they pa&s;&s;ed with loud Acclamations of Joy, unto the Church of the Augu&s;tin Fryers, where in the fir&s;t place, as was mo&s;t ju&s;t, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was Sung, and Thanks returned to God with Sincere Devotion: Thence they went to the Hou&s;e of the Go|vernour Count <HI>Staremberg,</HI> where he recei|ved the Applau&s;e and Prai&s;es of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> which were due to his Conduct and Valour; and the like Commendations were be&s;towed by them upon all the Officers and Souldiers of the Garri&s;on, who had every one &s;ignalized them&s;elves during this Siege, by &s;ome

In the mean time, the Be&s;ieged Inhabitants, who had long been pent up and inclo&s;ed within the Walls of the City, were not only de&s;i|rous to breath in a more open Air, but were carried with a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Ap|proaches, which the Enemy had been ma|king on them, and how near they had en|tred to the Heart of the City, that it may be doubtful, whether it was more plea&s;ant to Men, lately delivered from the extremi|ty of a peri&s;hing Condition, to behold how near they were to the devouring Enemy, and yet to e&s;cape; or to &s;urvey, with an amazed Curio&s;ity, the Tents, Batteries, Trenches and Approaches, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had formed again&s;t them with wonderful Art and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The Face of all things was now changed, Want and Famine into Plenty, Fears and Angui&s;h into Joy, and War into Peace: In the Vizier's Tent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier's Tent allot|ted to the King of <HI>Po|land.</HI></NOTE> of which the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the rich Ve&s;tments, Jewels, and Mony there found, were valued at a Million, and became the Prey and Boo|ty allotted to his Maje&s;ty, which no Man envied con&s;idering the generous and heroick Action of that Prince, for who&s;e Merit no Reward &s;eemed too great: Among&s;t other things in that Tent the Standard of <HI>Maho|met</HI> was found, which the King &s;ent to Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the XI. by his Secretary <HI>Tulenti.</HI></P>
<P>On the 14th. the Emperor, with the E|lectors of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> entred in|to the City of <HI>Vienna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror's En|trance into <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE> which he beheld with Eyes of Compa&s;&s;ion and Tenderne&s;s; for &s;eeing the De&s;olation, which the Enemy had made, and con&s;idering the Slaughter of many of his tru&s;ty Citizens and valiant Sol|diers, he could not refrain from Tears of Sorrow, mixed with Joy for the Deliverance and Safety of the &s;uperviving Party. Being entred within the Gates, he went directly to the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s, not on Hor&s;e-back, or on a Triumphal Chariot, but humbly and meekly on Foot, carrying a Taper in his Hand, in a kind of peniten|tial manner, went to the great Altar to pay his Duty, and offer up his &s;olemn Thanks to Almighty God, according to his u&s;ual Devotion, for the wonderful and miraculous Deliverance of that City.

Never was there a more heroick and generous Action per|formed in the World, than was this of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who, after a long and tedi|ous March, &s;o valiantly expo&s;ed his own Per&s;on to Hazard, and his Army in the face of an Enemy, which to human Appearance was Invincible; and all this to bring Relief and Succour to an Ally, and to maintain the Bulwark of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> again&s;t Infidels, and Enemies to the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e; 'tis &s;uch a piece of Bravery as cannot be parallelled with all its Circum&s;tances in any Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t Ages; and therefore with much Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice were his Prai&s;es celebrated over all the Chri&s;tian World; and the Poets, and other refined Wits in diver&s;e Countries, and diffe|rent Languages, exerci&s;ed their Pens in Pa|negyricks and Elogies, &s;triving to out-vy and &s;urpa&s;s each other in the Exce&s;&s;es of Prai&s;e, which how Hyperbolical &s;oever could never reach to the imputation of Flattery.

</FLOATEXT> Which Noble and Heroick Action would have remained on the Records of Hi&s;tory to all Po&s;terity in honour of this King, had he not afterwards &s;ullied and tarni&s;hed the Glory thereof, by conde&s;cending and &s;toop|ing to Actions as low, and mean, as this was Sublime, and only worthy of the Dig|nity of a Heroe, as we &s;hall &s;how in the following Year.</P>
<P>But to return again from whence we have digre&s;&s;ed; the Emperor and King having pa&s;&s;ed their Complements, Prince <HI>Alexander,</HI> Son of the King, whom his Father pre&s;en|ted with the Complement of having Enli&s;t|ed him&s;elf early into the Service of his Im|perial Maje&s;ty.

<P>The King after having viewed the Riches taken in the Vizier's Tent, which he a&s;&s;um|ed to him&s;elf as the Reward of his own At|chievements: Out of Complement, he &s;ent to the Emperor to make tender of one half of the Booty, accompanying the Me&s;&s;age with the <HI>Tugh,</HI> or Hor&s;e-tayl on a Staff, with a bra&s;s Knob on the top, which was one of the three Staves of Authority carried before the Vizier: Such another kind of Pre&s;ent like this, being <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Standard, he &s;ent to the Pope; which being Gifts of no great Value, more than for the Curio&s;ity of them, he frankly and really offered; but as to half the Prey, it was generally believed, that his Maje&s;ty was well informed before|hand, that the Emperor was of too generous a Nature to accept thereof; and would not have been &s;o prodigal of his Offers, had he im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">gined he &s;hould have been taken at his word.</P>
<P>But it is not here to be forgotten, that after the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Newdorf</HI> had &s;ung <HI>Te Deum</HI> before the Emperor, and performed the other Ceremonies, which la&s;ted for the &s;pace of four Hours; at the Conclu&s;ion of all, when the Emperor was come out of the Church, the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Vienna</HI> turned him about, and pointed to the Spire of the Cathedral Steeple: Behold, Sir, &s;aid he, that Spar which i&s;&s;ues from the Spire, at the end of which is a Star within the Cre&s;cent or Half-moon; and con&s;ider that that Monu|ment was there fixed in the Year 1529, when <HI>Soliman</HI> Be&s;ieged the City, and was &s;o to remain by Compact with the Citizens, conditionally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cro&s;s erected in place of the Half-moon.</NOTE> That the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould not batter the Steeple with their Cannon: And now whereas that Article was broken, by the continual Shootings, which the Enemy had made again&s;t it at the la&s;t Siege, it is but rea&s;on that the Cre&s;cent &s;hould be ta|ken down; and in Memory of the pre&s;ent Deliverance, that a Cro&s;s &s;hould be erected in the place thereof; for which the Emperor having given pre&s;ent Orders, they were ac|cordingly executed.</P>

<P>The Emperor finding his Palace much ruined and unfurni&s;hed at <HI>Vienna,</HI> &s;taid but few days there before he returned to <HI>Lintz,</HI> where he intended to remain until the Repairs of Court and City were made, and the Walls and Trenches cleared of the dead Bodies, which rendred the Air Unhealthful and In|fectious: During the time of his &s;tay at <HI>Vienna,</HI> he took delight to vi&s;it the Re|trenchments and Fortifications, which the Defendants had made behind the Walls and Ba&s;tions, to di&s;pute every Foot and Inch of Ground, as occa&s;ion had required: He al&s;o &s;urveyed the Batteries, Trenches and Ap|proaches of the Enemy, and &s;aw the Stores of Ammunition and Provi&s;ions which they had left behind them, which &s;erved again to recruit and repleni&s;h the Ar&s;enal at <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Li&s;t and Account whereof was as fol|loweth: Six Thou&s;and five Hundred Tents, four Thou&s;and five Hundred Barrels of Pow|der, &s;ix Thou&s;and weight of Lead, 20.000 Granado Shells, eight Thou&s;and Hand-gra|nadoes, 11.000 Shovels and Pickaxes, one Thou&s;and &s;ix Hundred weight of Match, two Thou&s;and five Hundred Fire-balls, 52 Hun|dred weight of Pitch, eleven Hundred weight of Oyl of Petolium and of Tar, and five Hun|dred

<P>After this Work was done, the next was to employ all the Labourers belonging to the City, with the captivated <HI>Turks,</HI> whom they made to a&s;&s;i&s;t in filling up the Trenches, Holes and Vaults which the <HI>Turks</HI> had made; &s;ome of which were &s;o deep, that they &s;eemed rather to be Caves and Dens than Trenches for covert and &s;helter for Be&s;ieg|ers: So that had not the <HI>Turks</HI> bu&s;ied them|&s;elves in &s;uch fruitle&s;s Labours, they might have compa&s;&s;ed that in half the time, which was not effected in the &s;pace of &s;ixty two Days. Among&s;t the&s;e other Works, &s;everal Vaults were found filled with dead Bodies, putrified and &s;tinking, and all the Country round for many Leagues were &s;trowed with dead Carca&s;&s;es; for Burying of which, or Burning, or ca&s;ting into the <HI>Danube,</HI> &s;trict Orders were given, and which with much diligence were executed, to prevent a Pe&s;ti|lence, the Putrefaction of which began al|ready to infect the Air. Among&s;t the dead, the Bodies of many Women and Children were found, who had been made Slaves and Captives by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and Ma&s;&s;acred by them, either out of Revenge, or becau&s;e they were an Incumbrance to them in their Flight; but to the&s;e Bodies &s;ome Re&s;pect was &s;hown, being carried to <HI>Cimeteries,</HI> and there interred after the Rites of the Chri&s;ti|an Burial, with Cro&s;&s;es erected over their Graves. How&s;oever &s;ome <HI>Turks,</HI> who were Men of more tender Bowels than the others (for we mu&s;t not figure them all to be of the like fierce and cruel Di&s;po&s;ition) did quit the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Slaves with more gen|tlene&s;s, and &s;et them at liberty with their Lives, of which mo&s;t were Women and Children, the which the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> took up and brought them back again to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>By this time, that the Trenches were fil|led without the City, and the Walls and &s;ome Hou&s;es repaired, the News of the happy Deliverance of <HI>Vienna</HI> had &s;pread it &s;elf over all the Countries, from whence Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts came, and Boats la|den with Corn, Wine, Fruits and Herbs ar|rived daily in, to &s;upply the Wants of the City; the Face of which was totally chang|ed, from Famine to Plenty, from War to Peace, and from Terror and di&s;mal Appre|hen&s;ions to Joy, Triumph and Fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>The Spirits of the Imperiali&s;ts and <HI>Poles</HI> be|ing highly rai&s;ed by the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, &s;ome Par|ties pur&s;ued the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were as much de|jected as the others were elevated; and th&ocirc; they ha&s;tened in a precipitous Flight, appre|hending an Enemy ju&s;t at their backs; yet many of them in the Arrear, appointed to conduct twelve Pieces of Cannon, and &s;ome Baggage were over-taken in the Pur&s;uit, and brought back to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where the&s;e Captives, with their other Brethren, were ordered to work in Chains for filling the Trenches, which they had before opened, and repair of the Walls and Ba&s;tions, which they had battered down with their Cannon, and blown up with their Mines.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier ha&s;tning his March, or rather his Flight, for (as we &s;aid before) he actually Ran away and &s;hamefully turned his Back with near 120.000 Fighting Men; meditating (as we may believe) of the Di&s;|grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier com|plaining to the Grand Seignior a|gain&s;t the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda.</HI></NOTE> Ruin and evil con&s;equences of this Misfortune, &s;ought and endeavoured to clear his ill Conduct, and want of Courage by ca&s;ting it upon others, as is common to the Nature of Mankind.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of his good Fortune, was de&s;irous to con|clude this Campaign with the taking of <HI>Gran,</HI> which was the glorious period to which the Emperor directed him, if po&s;&s;ible, to advance his Affairs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Gran</HI> in|tended.</NOTE> In order hereunto the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> taking fir&s;t (according to his u&s;ual Methods) a judicious Survey of the &s;ituation of the Place, and the way thereunto; ob&s;erved, that in the middle of the River, &s;omething below <HI>Gran,</HI> there was an I&s;land, in which was not only good Fo|rage for the Hor&s;e, but al&s;o an ancient In|trenchment, which, with &s;ome little Labour, might be made u&s;eful and defen&s;ive again&s;t the Cannon of the Town: And from the farther &s;ide of that I&s;land, with the help of a few Boats, the whole Army might find an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> appro|ving this De&s;ign, Boats were ordered down from <HI>Comorra,</HI> for framing the Bridge: But whil&s;t this was doing, the late Succe&s;&s;es which had brought great Reputation to the Empe|ror's Affairs, had moved <HI>Tekeli</HI> to &s;end the Count <HI>de Humanay</HI> in Behalf of the Malecon|tents, to offer Terms of Peace and Pacifi|cation.

In &s;hort, he told them, That if they would hope to ta&s;t of the Emperor's Clemency, they mu&s;t with|out any previous Conditions lay down their Arms, and renounce all Alliance with the <HI>Turk,</HI> which was the fir&s;t Preliminary or Step to a Treaty.

<P>The Bridges being fini&s;hed by the 16th of this Month of <HI>October,</HI> and the <HI>Bava|rian</HI> Troops come up to joyn with the Ar|my; the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> de&s;ired the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> according to his Place of Pre|cedency, to lead the way with his Troops; but the King made &s;ome difficulty thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Poland</HI> propo&s;es en|quiries con|cerning the State of <HI>Gran.</HI></NOTE> alledging, That a Survey ought fir&s;t to be taken of the &s;ituation of the Place, and En|quiries made how well it was provided with Men and Ammunition, and how far the Vi|zier, with his Forces, was retired from af|fording it Relief, or di&s;turbing the Siege. Accordingly Two thou&s;and Hor&s;e being ap|pointed to take a View of the Country, they pa&s;&s;ed the Bridges without oppo&s;ition or di|&s;turbance, and &s;o di&s;mayed the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they de&s;erted <HI>Thomas-burg,</HI> a Palanca not far from <HI>Gran,</HI> and &s;et it on Fire, but was &s;oon quenched, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion taken by the Im|periali&s;ts. Upon the appearance of a Party on this &s;ide of the River, two Hungarians of <HI>Totis</HI> brought Intelligence, that the Vi|zier was marched with his Army towards <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> having left a &s;mall Force encamped near unto <HI>Buda.</HI> This News ha&s;tned the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army over the Ri|ver, (tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> remained in their Camp, and moved not as yet) and gave Encou+ragement to the Generals to hope, that the
<PB N="129" REF="74"> Siege would not be of long Continuance, or of much lo&s;s of Time, or Men. The Hor&s;e and Foot marched apace over the Bridges into the I&s;land, and &s;o by a &s;hort cut, cro&s;|&s;ed over another Bridge to the Banks of the <HI>Danube,</HI> &s;omething above Cannot-&s;hot be|low <HI>Gran.</HI> In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> with the Chief Officers of both Ar|mies, took a particular Survey of the Town, and of the Ground and Country thereabouts.</P>
<P><HI>Gran</HI> is &s;ituate about &s;ix <HI>Hungarian,</HI> or thirty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles below <HI>Comorra;</HI> it was anciently called <HI>Strigonium,</HI> but now by the <HI>Hungarians</HI> it is named <HI>Gran;</HI> from the Ri|ver <HI>Gran,</HI> which comes out of the Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> and empties it &s;elf in the <HI>Danube,</HI> ju&s;t over-again&s;t the City.

In the Year 1543, this City was fir&s;t brought under the Turki&s;h Dominion, by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent. In the Year 1594 it was Be|&s;ieged by <HI>Mathias,</HI> Arch Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> but was not taken until the following Year by Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who in a bloody Fight totally defeated the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force.

How&s;oever, in the Year 1605, inve&s;ting the Place with a more formidable Power, it yielded it &s;elf into the Hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who have &s;ince that time remain|ed Ma&s;ters thereof until this happy Year 1683.</P>
<P>The Imperial Army continuing its Pa&s;|&s;age over the Bridges, the Two thou&s;and Men of the advanced Troops took their Po&s;t on the 21&s;t and 22d at Night, not doubting but that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> would follow with his Army in the Rear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Poland</HI> declines the Siege.</NOTE> as was before re&s;olved; but, contrary to all expe|ctation, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> received Ad|vice, that the King, by per&s;ua&s;ion of his Senators, had changed his Mind, and de|&s;igned not to pa&s;s the River, letting him know, that he &s;hould continue his Camp for three or four Days longer; but after that he &s;hould be con&s;trained to March away. This alteration in the King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Coun&s;els, was &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ing to the Duke of <HI>Loraine;</HI> for th&ocirc; he doubted not but in a &s;hort time to become Ma&s;ter of the Place with the Imperial Forces only, with|out the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Poles;</HI> yet con&s;i|dering that the News of the Separation of the two Armies, might encourage the Grand Vizier with his Army (which as yet was not far di&s;tant) to return to the Relief of the Town, and the Be&s;ieged to a more vi|gorous Defence; and that the Malecon|tents might be induced to Po&s;t them&s;elves on the <HI>Danube,</HI> to intercept and interrupt all Communication between <HI>Comorra</HI> and the Camp: Which Matters were of &s;uch high Importance, that the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> thought not fit to form the Siege, until &s;uch time as he had fir&s;t fixed the King in his former Re&s;olutions; unto which he &s;ent the Counts of <HI>Staremberg</HI> and <HI>Rabata,</HI> to pre&s;s him with all the earne&s;tne&s;s imaginable, gi|ving him to under&s;tand how difficult it was for the Imperial Army to retire from an En|terpri&s;e, to which all the Methods and Forms were already laid and prepared; and of which the De&s;ign appeared &s;o promi&s;ing, that in a few Days they might with good rea&s;on expect a happy Succe&s;s and Event thereof. Moreover the Emperor had given his Orders for inve&s;ting <HI>Gran,</HI> and was al|ready in expectation to hear that the Siege was laid, e&s;teeming it of high Advantage to the Reputation of his Affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is per|&s;uaded to it by the Duke of <HI>Loraine.</HI></NOTE> to have the Campaign concluded with the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;o glorious an Action: Yet what&s;oever was or could be &s;aid by the&s;e Officers did not pre|vail on the King, until the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> him&s;elf went in Per&s;on, to repre&s;ent the great Inconveniences, and even Subver&s;ion of the late happy Succe&s;&s;es, which would be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences at this time of the Separation of the two Armies. In fine, he &s;o managed his Di&s;cour&s;e with tho&s;e Rea|&s;ons, and in &s;uch obliging Terms, that the King concurred with him, de&s;iring him to ha&s;ten the execution of this Enterpri&s;e, in which there was no time to be lo&s;t, con&s;i|dering how near the Winter-&s;ea&s;on was ap|proached.</P>

<P>In this manner the Campagne being glori|ou&s;ly concluded to the great Reputation of the Emperor's Affairs, and to the Di&s;grace and Di&s;couragement of the <HI>Turks;</HI> The next care and incumbence of the Generals was to provide Winter-quarters for the refre&s;h|ment and welfare of the Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri|&s;tian Army drawn into Winter-quarters.</NOTE> which had been much hara&s;&s;ed by the Fatigues of many and great Actions.

<P>The <HI>Croats</HI> found the like good fortune, having in their march taken the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Raboniz,</HI> about &s;ix Engli&s;h Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Kani&s;ia,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Probenz,</HI> Situate on the River <HI>Drave;</HI> as al&s;o the Ca&s;tle of <HI>E&s;&s;eghet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E&s;&s;eghet, Provens,</HI> and other places ta|ken.</NOTE> and the City and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Brevenitz,</HI> which was &s;o near to <HI>Kani&s;ia,</HI> that it &s;eemed already blocked up, if not almo&s;t be&s;ieged: And here the&s;e generous Soldiers thought fit to fix their Winter-quarters, which they had conquered and won, as if they had &s;corn'd to abide in any place which was not opened to them by their own Swords.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> being at <HI>Sequi,</HI> about an hours march from <HI>Leventz,</HI> and bu&s;ied in a&s;&s;igning Quarters for Twenty &s;even Re|giments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Forces of <HI>Litua|nia</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Loraine.</HI></NOTE> was vi&s;ited by the General of <HI>Lituania,</HI> accompanied with the principal Officers, who gave him to under&s;tand, that they were come with an Army of Ten thou|&s;and Men, which were Quarter'd in the Neighbouring Towns and Villages, and

<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> in his march to|wards <HI>Cackaw,</HI> (which with <HI>E&s;peries</HI> and <HI>Tokai,</HI> were appointed for the Quarters of his Troops) pa&s;&s;ing near to the City of <HI>Setzin,</HI> &s;ent his Son Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> with Summons to Surrender, which being refu|&s;ed, the <HI>Poles</HI> made an Attack in two places, with which the Defendants being affrighted, offered to Capitulate, and in that Amaze|ment before the Articles were agreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Setzin</HI> ta|ken by the <HI>Poles.</HI></NOTE> they opened their Gates and let in the Enemy, who being obliged by no Terms, made a mi&s;erable &s;laughter of the poor Inhabitants, of which there were Two thou&s;and <HI>Turks,</HI> be&s;ides Twelve hundred <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> and <HI>Spa|hees;</HI> and on the Walls were twenty Pieces of Cannon mounted. A Garri&s;on of <HI>Germans</HI> being put into the Town, the King continued his march towards the Quarters de&s;igned for his Troops, where having refre&s;hed him|&s;elf for &s;ome few Days, he pa&s;&s;ed on to|wards <HI>Cracovia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Poland</HI> and his Army re|turn home.</NOTE> attended only with the Servants and Officers of his Court: And not long afterwards was followed by his whole Army into <HI>Poland;</HI> where we will leave them to their own Fortune, which &s;eemed favourable to them abroad, whil&s;t they were directed by the au&s;picious Con|duct of the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> and other the greate&s;t Captains in the World. But looking on them in their own Country, as we &s;hall hereafter do, we &s;hall find their Succe&s;&s;es much different from their late Triumphs and Glories: For being left to them&s;elves, and in&s;pired with French Councils and In|tere&s;ts, we &s;hall hear of no great Atchieve|ments afterwards gained upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> nor attemps made to recover <HI>Kaminiec,</HI> the Bulwark and Fortre&s;s of their Kingdom on that &s;ide: Of which the <HI>Turks</HI> being &s;en&s;ible, made but weak Preparations a|gain&s;t them, leaving them to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who (as things were then governed) pro|ved a &s;ufficient match for their Neighbours the <HI>Poles.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding this &s;eparation, and that the <HI>Polanders</HI> were withdrawn in|to their own Country;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Ca&s;tles be|longing to the Male|contents &s;ubmit.</NOTE> yet the Reputa|tion of the Emperor was highly exalted, and his name terrible to his Enemies, &s;o that every &s;mall Ca&s;tle and Fortre&s;s Surren|der'd upon the fir&s;t Summons; as the Ca|&s;tles of <HI>Ja&s;em, Zalab&s;tat, Sum&s;tam</HI> and <HI>Se|ramz,</HI> with other places all belonging to the Malecontents, of which divers Per&s;ons of Quality returned to their Duty and Al|legiance, and particularly the Count of <HI>Zabbor,</HI> the Commander in Chief under <HI>Tekeli,</HI> who by the Count <HI>E&s;terha&s;i,</HI> being introduced to the Pre&s;ence of his Imperial Maje&s;ty, he was with his u&s;ual Clemency received, and a gracious Pardon granted to him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Triumphs in Chri&s;tendom increa|&s;ed the Troubles, Di&s;contents and Commo|tions in <HI>Turky,</HI> which are always attended with Tragedies and De&s;truction of their Chief Mini&s;ters and Rulers.

The Grand Vizier be|ing &s;en&s;ible of his Danger from the&s;e Ene|mies, and from the ill &s;ucce&s;s of Affairs, which u&s;ually prove fatal to the Generals or Commanders in Chief, marched away towards <HI>Belgrade</HI> with a great part of his Army, e&s;teeming it a Matter of higher Con|&s;equence to his own &s;afety, to purge him|&s;elf from blame in the Opinion of his Ma|&s;ter, than to return back to the Relief of <HI>Gran,</HI> being already advanced as far on his way to <HI>Belgrade</HI> as the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> where he received the fir&s;t intelligence of the Defeat, of the &s;everal Pa&s;has before <HI>Barcan,</HI> and the Siege of <HI>Strigonium.</HI> The&s;e misfortunes ha&s;tned his proceedings to <HI>Bel|grade,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier ex|cu&s;es his Misfortunes before the Grand Seig|nior.</NOTE> where being admitted to the pre|&s;ence of the Sultan; he de&s;cribed the admira|ble order of the Siege before <HI>Vienna,</HI> and how near he was to have been Ma&s;ter there|of, and even of all <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and the Em|peror's Hereditary Countries, as Appendages

But whil&s;t they and others of the &s;ame Faction, were meditating of the&s;e Matters&punc; <HI>Tekeli&punc;</HI> who had heard of the Complaints made again&s;t him by the Vizier, and that he was in part charged with the mi&s;carriage of the late Succe&s;&s;es; fearing his own &s;afety,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> comes to the Grand Seignior.</NOTE> came and boldly pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the Feet of the Grand Seignior, and in di&s;charge of him&s;elf, &s;olely laid all the blame upon the Vizier, which he confirmed by &s;o many particular In&s;tances, and by &s;uch Rea&s;ons, that the Grand Seignior a&s;&s;ented to all his Allegations: But how&s;oever, not thinking it &s;ea&s;onable at pre&s;ent to &s;tir greater Com|motions by change of Officers, (to which he was never much inclined) he favoura|bly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Tekeli</HI> with new a&s;&s;urances of his Protection, and of &s;ending him very con&s;iderable Forces, and Recruits again&s;t the next Spring.</P>
<P>This Addre&s;s of <HI>Tekeli</HI> had a little pre|par'd the Grand Seignior's Mind to receive different Impre&s;&s;ions, than what he had hi|therto conceived again&s;t his Grand Vizier; which were &s;oon afterwards ripened by new Commotions rai&s;ed by the indu&s;try of the Faction among&s;t the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jani|&s;aries</HI> de|mand the Head of the Vizier.</NOTE> who Tu|multuou&s;ly a&s;&s;embling ran to the Grand Seignior, and crying out, that the Vizier had Treacherou&s;ly for&s;aken their Compa|nions, and &s;uffer'd them mi&s;erably to Pe|ri&s;h in their Trenches before <HI>Vienna,</HI> and had Unju&s;tly and without any Rea&s;on put their <HI>Aga</HI> or General to Death; for which Crimes, and many other Mi&s;carriages they demanded the Head of the Vizier. The Sultan (to whom nothing was &s;o terrible as the Toleration of the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI>) entertained them with fair Words and Promi&s;es, and by di&s;tributing Money among&s;t them, for that time di&s;per&s;ed this Tumultuous Meet|ing. But fearing the return again of the Rabble and this unruly Soldiery, a <HI>Divan</HI> or Council was called, at which the Mufti and all the Viziers of the Bench, with other Grandees of the Court were pre&s;ent: After a mature Con&s;ideration of the State of Affairs in the Empire, it was concluded of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for ap|pea&s;ing the Minds of the Soldiery, that the Grand Vizier &s;hould Dye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Death re&s;olved.</NOTE> who had been the Cau&s;e and Author of all the late Mi&s;|fortunes.

<P>The Vizier finding a Di&s;po&s;ition in the Grand Seignior to continue the War, de&s;i|red to be relea&s;ed from his Office, which the weakne&s;s of his Body rendred him un|capable to di&s;charge; to which the Sultan reply'd, That he was one of tho&s;e, who had opened the Gate, by which much Di|&s;honour and Mi&s;chief was entred into the Empire, and now would with-draw his Neck out of the Collar; but if he did not &s;hut the Gate again, he would hang him in all his Divan Robes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> indeed were then very low, and reduced to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s for want of Soldiers, that from <HI>Selibrea,</HI> which is about thirty Miles from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> in all the Coun|try of <HI>Romania,</HI> (except the Sea-coa&s;t) all that were capable of bearing Arms were &s;ent to the War; but being raw Country People, proved of little Force again&s;t a Veterane Army.</P>
<P>The Vizier finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in this Contrivance, and &s;en&s;ible of the pre|&s;ent Di&s;advantages, propo&s;ed that the War &s;hould be managed on the defen&s;ive part, rather than to adventure the whole Concern|ment of the Empire on the Hazards and Chances of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A defen&s;ive War in|tended.</NOTE> which &s;eemed to be go|verned by &s;ome evil Influences of the Stars, which at that time were not very propi|tious to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Cau&s;e. This Council being generally well approved, it produced two Re&s;olutions, one was to divert the in|tended De&s;ign of the Grand Seignior's go|ing in Per&s;on to the War; for in that Ca&s;e nothing could become the awful pre&s;ence and appearance of the Sultan, but Fire and Slaughter, and direful Vengeance where&s;o|ever his terrible Sword was drawn; it being agreeable to the Opinion which the <HI>Turks</HI> fancy and conceive of their Emperor, That <HI>he is Omnipotent, and that in one Hand he carries all the Riches and Honours of the World, and in the other Victory, and all &s;orts of Delights for ever.</HI> But to draw this Ca&s;e a little nearer to the Per&s;on of the Vizier him&s;elf; it was farther re&s;olved, That in ca&s;e a defen&s;ive War were to be managed, it were neither con&s;i&s;tent with the Reputa|tion of the Grand Vizier, who was the Sultan's Deputy and Repre&s;entative; but more becoming a <HI>Sardar,</HI> with Title of <HI>Se|raskier,</HI> or General to wage a War, in which the chief Art is to decline a Battel and all Engagements. Thus had this old and poli|tick Vizier obtained his Point by &s;itting at Home, and &s;eeing others play the Game, which he could approve or di&s;approve without danger, according to the Succe&s;&s;es: The Per&s;on appointed to be <HI>Seraskier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Seraskie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> appointed.</NOTE> or General, was <HI>Kara Oglou Chiamacam</HI> of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> who had formerly been Captain Pa&s;ha, or Admiral of the Seas.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier remaining at home, had time to con&s;ider and reflect, That the cau&s;e of the general Toleration of almo&s;t all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> again&s;t them, did proceed from the Neglect, Contempt and ill U&s;age which the late Vizier had put upon all the publick Repre&s;entatives of Chri&s;tian Prin|ces, &s;ome In&s;tances of which we have given at the beginning of this Hi&s;tory: To redre&s;s which, it was thought fit to cajole and &s;often a little the Foreign Mini&s;ters from Chri&s;tian Princes, whom the late Vi|zier had &s;o contemptuou&s;ly u&s;ed, and treat|ed with Di&s;grace, as had rai&s;ed all Chri&s;ten|dom about their Ears; and &s;o with much Complement the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were invited to <HI>Adrianople</HI> by the Vizier, to &s;it with him upon the <HI>Soffraw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Soffraw</HI> granted to the Chri&s;ti|an Mini|&s;ters.</NOTE> according to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom and Privi|ledge of Amba&s;&s;adors, which the Pride of the late Vizier would not allow them.

But he &s;acredly prote&s;ted to his Holine&s;s, that he took up Arms for no other Rea&s;on and Cau&s;e, than the Defence of his Country, and to con|&s;erve him&s;elf from entire Ruin, having had the experience of many years, that the Em|peror was in no State or Condition to defend him. That He and his Party did not de&s;erve the Odious Name of Rebels, con&s;idering that the Arms they took up were in Defence only of the Liberties, and Privileges granted unto them by the ancient Kings of</HI> Hungary, <HI>and particularly by King</HI> Andrew <HI>the</HI> II. <HI>who&s;e Letters are con&s;erved among&s;t the Archives of the</HI> Vatican; <HI>which if his Holine&s;s would be plea&s;ed to in&s;pect and examine, he would ea&s;i|ly find, that tho&s;e Articles have been &s;o far from being performed, that they have been wholly laid a&s;ide, and violated in every particular. That as to his own Per&s;on, he hath been de&s;|poyled of his E&s;tate, and made an Exile in the very tender years of Youth, with others of the Hungarian Nobility, who could never obtain redre&s;s upon their complaints, but in|&s;tead thereof received Sentence of Death by corrupt and partial Judges, without any re|gard to the formalities pre&s;cribed by Law.

In fine, He be&s;eeched his Holine&s;s to Judge of his Intentions by this Declaration, ra|ther than by the Sini&s;ter Reports of his Ene|mies, to whom he wi&s;hed a long Life, and a happy Pontificate.</HI></P>

The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> having in this manner &s;ecured the Pa&s;&s;es, which ob&s;tructed the Navigation of the <HI>Danube,</HI> he cau&s;ed the whole Army to march towards <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> and up|on the 30th of <HI>June,</HI> he encamped about three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles di&s;tant from that City; over which, in the Evening about Sun-&s;et, appeared a great Fire and Smoak, which was judged to ari&s;e from the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;et on Fire by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> and that the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves intended to Burn it to the ground: By break of Day in the Morning, the Duke mounting on Hor&s;e-back at the head of his Cavalry, (ordering the Foot to follow him at lei&s;ure) he ap|proached near the Walls, and gave orders to a Detachment of Dragoons to make di&s;|covery of the State and Condition of the place, which was &s;oon found to have been &s;et on Fire and abandoned by the <HI>Turks,</HI> only a few remained, who had not time with the re&s;t to pack up their Baggage and be gon; the&s;e endeavouring to make &s;ome little Oppo&s;ition were killed, and three Co|lours taken; tho&s;e who e&s;caped fled over the Bridge, and broak off Fifty of the Boats to prevent the Pur&s;uit of the Enemy, which floating down the Current, were taken up by the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> being come to <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> cau&s;ed the Fire to be extingui&s;hed, which had as yet Burnt but one third part of the Town, all the Stores of Ammunition and Provi&s;ion being &s;aved: The Works and Fortifications were ordered to be repaired, and Cannon to be mounted on the Walls; but the Place pro|ved too hot for them, being &s;o much in|commoded by ince&s;&s;ant &s;hooting from <HI>Buda,</HI> that there was no abiding for them there; for <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> lies in a beautiful Plain, and gives Denomination to the Country round about, which is called, <HI>Comitatus Pe&s;thien&s;is:</HI> From <HI>Buda</HI> it hath a &s;umptuous Pro&s;pect, by the appearance of the Towers on the old Walls, and Spires of the Mo&s;chs, but is &s;o over-topt by <HI>Buda,</HI> that all the Cannon there can &s;hoot into it; &s;o that the Imperial Ar|my quitted the Place, until it &s;hould fall into their Hands, and follow the Fate of <HI>Buda,</HI> as an Appendage or Dependance thereof.</P>
<P>The Troops being with-drawn from <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> they marched back to <HI>Witzen,</HI> where two Bridges of Boats were making to pa&s;s the River at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, where the River divides it &s;elf in two Branches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Army repa&s;&s;es the <HI>Danube.</HI></NOTE> and makes the Ferry over much more &s;hort and ea&s;y. The Pa&s;&s;age over the fir&s;t Branch or Arm was not very difficult; but that on the farther &s;ide of the I&s;land was much more hazardous, by rea&s;on that the Stream was broader and more rapid; and the <HI>Turks</HI> with 20.000 Men encamped within three Miles from the Banks of the River; but nothing &s;eemed now too hard or dangerous to a victorious Army, and an invincible Captain; for whil&s;t the Bridge was fini&s;h|ing with incredible Expedition, &s;ome Sol|diers for Spyes &s;wam over to the other &s;ide, where having ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> that the <HI>Turks</HI> lay with much Security within their Camp, and without any motion; (which was a &s;trange thing, con&s;idering that they might ea&s;ily have defended the River, and made the Pa&s;|&s;age over impo&s;&s;ible) Five thou&s;and Foot, with &s;ome Pieces of Cannon were ferried over in Boats, where being landed without any di&s;turbance, they intrenched them&s;elves, and rai&s;ed a Battery, from whence they could &s;hoot into the Enemies Camp, and &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;age of the Water for the re&s;t of the Army. On the 10th of this Month, the Bridge being fini&s;hed, the whole Army pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;ame Day, and joyned them&s;elves with the other Body already on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seraskier</HI> being informed, that only a part of the Army was got over, he advan|ced again&s;t them with all his Hor&s;e, and eight Hundred <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sera|skier</HI> A&s;|&s;aults the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></NOTE> and two &s;mall Field-pieces; with him were the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda,</HI> and thirteen other Pa&s;has, leaving the re&s;t of the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and all other his Foot, with the Cannon about the di&s;tance of an Hour's March: The Attack which the <HI>Turks</HI> made was &s;o &s;uddain, that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had &s;carce time to put their Forces into or|der of Battail; but how&s;oever &s;uch was the readine&s;s of this Army, and the good Di&s;|cipline of it, that every Regiment and Troop at the fir&s;t &s;ound of an Allarum took their Places without the lea&s;t Confu&s;ion. The Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> at the head of his Ca|valry, undertook to lead the Van, and there|with &s;u&s;tained the fir&s;t &s;hock of the Enemy with Carbine-&s;hot only, &s;tanding &s;o firm and re&s;olute, that no breach could be made into their Ranks; in which time, the re&s;t of the Army had opportunity to put them|&s;elves into po&s;ture of Battle, which, upon
<PB N="145" REF="81"> their Motion, appeared &s;o formidable, that the <HI>Turks</HI> began to make a di&s;orderly Re|treat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is repul|&s;ed and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ies.</NOTE> and to fly as fa&s;t as their Hor&s;es could carry them, until they came to the Place where the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> and Cannon remained: How&s;oever, being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, many of them came &s;hort home, and &s;everal Colours were taken; nor was this Action without &s;ome lo&s;s to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and particularly of &s;ome Per&s;ons of Note and Quality, as namely, The Count <HI>de Velheim, Bernardino Scotti,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Milan,</HI> with &s;ome other Voluntiers of Heroick Courage, who pre&s;&s;ing too forward to &s;ignalize their Valour, ended their days with much Honour and Glory. The next day being the 11th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> the whole Chri&s;tian Ar|my advanced towards <HI>Buda,</HI> between which, and a Party of the <HI>Turks</HI> there happened a Skirmi&s;h, to the di&s;advantage of the latter; with which, and with a con&s;tant Train of other ill Succe&s;&s;es, the Turki&s;h Army being cowarded and di&s;mayed, with-drew them|&s;elves out of the open Plains, to &s;eek &s;hel|ter under Hills and Mountains, and lodged them&s;elves near St. <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Mount; whil&s;t Major General <HI>Staremberg,</HI> advancing near the City, began to prepare Matters nece&s;&s;a|ry towards a Siege.</P>
<P>The 13th the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;et fire to the lower Town of <HI>Buda,</HI> and retired into the upper, which was &s;ituate on a Hill, and defended by a &s;trong Ca&s;tle. The Fortifications here|of were not very regular, but made of old Towers without Ba&s;tions; but the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of Eight thou&s;and Men, was the be&s;t of its Strength, Commanded by five Pa&s;haes, and well &s;upplied with all &s;orts of Ammunition and Provi&s;ion; the Governour was the Vizier of <HI>Buda,</HI> and under him, as his Deputy-Governour, was <HI>Shitan Ibrahim,</HI> of whom we &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to give a more particular Character.</P>
<P>The 14th a &s;mall Attack was given, and de&s;igned purpo&s;ely as a good Omen to the Soldiery, who &s;till retained in their Memo|ries, that the &s;ame Day of the Year pa&s;t, the <HI>Turks</HI> had formed their Siege before <HI>Vi|enna;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> form|ed.</NOTE> and this very Day the Duke of <HI>Lo|raine</HI> had brought his heavy Cannon to the places of Battery, and had now perfected a formal Siege again&s;t the capital City of <HI>Hungary:</HI> The next day the Cannon be|ginning to play, they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Ditch, and of St. <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Mount, which Commands the Town, and thereon a Battery was rai&s;ed. The <HI>Sera|skier</HI> finding that his Army was di&s;mayed, and neither for their Courage, nor Numbers, a competent Match for their victorious Ene|my, retired three Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Bu|da,</HI> intending often to trouble and infe&s;t the Be&s;iegers with continual Alarums.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were thus acting, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> received Advice, that the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Maroz,</HI> who was appointed to guard the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> was advanced with Two thou&s;and Five hundred Men to <HI>Vitro|vitz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa&s;ha of <HI>Maroz</HI> overthrown</NOTE> a Place about a League di&s;tant from the Camp, expecting Four hundred Men more under Command of the <HI>Bei</HI> of <HI>Gra|di&s;ca,</HI> with de&s;ign to force their way in|to <HI>Buda:</HI> To prevent which, the Duke de|tached Four thou&s;and Croats under the Command of Count <HI>Tran&s;mandorf</HI> to march again&s;t them, and ordered the <HI>German</HI> For|ces to &s;tand all Night to their Arms to avoid a Surpri&s;e. <HI>Tran&s;mandorf</HI> marched until &s;even a Clock in the Morning always a-trot; and having about that time met the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Marotz,</HI> he immediately engaged with him, and charged him &s;o furiou&s;ly, that after &s;ome &s;mall Re&s;i&s;tence, the <HI>Turks</HI> fled; of whom about a Hundred were killed in the Pur&s;uit, and &s;everal Pri&s;oners taken. After which Succe&s;s, <HI>Tran&s;mandorf</HI> returning back to the Camp, fortunately Encountred the Governour of <HI>Gradi&s;ca</HI> with his Four Hundred Men, who, going to joyn with the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Marotz,</HI> (of who&s;e ill Succe&s;s he had as yet received no Intelligence) was engaged and defeated by him upon the fir&s;t Charge or On-&s;et, and had all been cut in pieces, had they not been favoured by the &s;helter and thickne&s;s of &s;ome neighbouring Woods. On this Occa&s;ion the <HI>Croats</HI> took fourteen Colours, with &s;everal of their Cymbals and Trumpets, and twenty Pri&s;oners: They lo&s;t only fourteen of their Men, and had the Pillage of the Camp, with great &s;tore of good Provi&s;ions, with which they fea&s;ted them&s;elves, and nouri&s;hed their Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>And now let us leave the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> for a while before this City, employed in an Enterpri&s;e, which could not be effected until two Years aferwards, th&ocirc; all that time a con&s;tant cour&s;e of ill Fortune ran again&s;t the <HI>Turks:</HI> And let us &s;ee what Pre|parations were making at <HI>Venice,</HI> and re|count the Actions and Atchievements which this Republick carried on this Year again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> pur&s;uant to the Proclamation of War lately publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Doge of <HI>Venice,</HI> called <HI>Marco Anto|nio Gu&s;tiniano,</HI> who entred upon the Govern|mernt the 26th day of <HI>April</HI> of this Year, <MILESTONE N="1684"> together with the Council, made choice of the&s;e General Officers for carrying on the War: Namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Veneti|ans</HI> prepare for War, and nomi|nate their Officers.</NOTE> <HI>Franci&s;co Moro&s;ini</HI> Captain General, <HI>Dominico Mocenigo</HI> Proveditor Ge|neral of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> Ge|neral of the Infantry, <HI>Ale&s;&s;andro Molino</HI> and <HI>Antonio Bembo</HI> Captains extraordinary of the Ships, <HI>Paulo Michiel, Matthew Pi&s;ani</HI> and <HI>John Moro&s;ini</HI> Commanders extraordinary of the Galea&s;&s;es; and General <HI>Strazoldo</HI> quit|ted

<P>The whole <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of Sixteen Gallies, &s;ix Gallea&s;&s;as, and &s;ixteen Sail of Ships; to them were joyned five of the Pope's Gallies, and &s;even of <HI>Malta,</HI> and four Gallies belonging to the Great Duke of <HI>To&s;cany.</HI> With part of this Fleet the Captain General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> put to Sea from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> on the 10th of <HI>June,</HI> for the I&s;land of <HI>Cor&s;u,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rendez|vous at <HI>Cor&s;u.</HI></NOTE> where the general Rendezvous for the whole Fleet was ap|pointed: At this Place a Council of War was called, where all the General Officers were pre&s;ent, together with the Proveditor General <HI>Cornaro,</HI> and General <HI>Strazoldo;</HI> and by them it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to Attack the I&s;land of <HI>Santa Maura.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land of <HI>Santa Maura</HI> was former|ly joyned to the Continent of <HI>Greece,</HI> and reckned among&s;t the We&s;tern, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Archi-pelago</HI> were among&s;t the Ea&s;tern I&s;lands; it was anciently known by the Name of <HI>Leucas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Santa Mau|ra.</NOTE> and was part of the King|dom of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> It was once a Penin&s;ula, adjoyning to <HI>Epirus</HI> by a narrow I&s;thmus of Land, but at the great Charge and La|bour of the Inhabitants of <HI>Corinth,</HI> it was cut off from the Continent, and made an I&s;land: It is near the <HI>Morea,</HI> at the entrance into the Gulf of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> where was fought that famous Battle in the Year 1571.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> the Son of <HI>Sultan Amu|rath,</HI> took this I&s;land from the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the Year 1457. But with the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els from the Pope, King <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12th of <HI>France,</HI> and the Knights of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> it was, after a bloudy Fight, recovered out of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the Reign of <HI>Bajazet</HI> the II, in the Year 1499, <HI>Benedetto Pe&s;aro</HI> being General. But the Year following a Peace being made, it was re&s;tored to the <HI>Turks,</HI> conditionally, That the I&s;land of <HI>Cephalania</HI> &s;hould remain to the <HI>Venetians</HI> for ever. This I&s;land being the chief Harbour at pre&s;ent, and Refuge of all the Pyrates and Cor&s;airs of <HI>Barbary,</HI> which much infe&s;ted the Gulf, and rendred the Navigation very un&s;ecure, and which hindred the <HI>Venetians</HI> from being the ab|&s;olute Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Seas, this Enterpri&s;e was re&s;olved to be the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and methodical in order to more important Ad|ventures.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the 19th of <HI>July,</HI> the whole Fleet, together with <HI>Tartanas</HI> and <HI>Fe|lucas</HI> carrying Land-forces, &s;et Sail from <HI>Cor|fu,</HI> and the next day arrived at <HI>Little-more,</HI> then Cannon-&s;hot di&s;tant from <HI>Santa Maura,</HI> where they ca&s;t Anchor, and landed their Forces, which con&s;i&s;ted of two Battalions of the Pope's, and of <HI>Malta</HI> Six hundred Men each, and Eight hundred Men drawn out of other Troops: Among&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>Malta</HI> were a Hundred Knights, who, clad in their Coat-armours of red Sattin, with the white Cro&s;s of their Order, made a &s;plendid Appearance. The next day the whole Fleet entred the Port of <HI>Demata,</HI> which lies to the Ea&s;tward of the Town, and is capable to receive great numbers of Ve&s;&s;els, and the Captain General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> went in Per&s;on on &s;hoar, taking a view of the &s;everal Po&s;ts, in which the Forces had lodged them&s;elves, and of that particularly called <HI>Chiche,</HI> which was a Hou&s;e of Plea|&s;ure belonging to the Aga's Son, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Captain <HI>Manetta.</HI> But before <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> thought fit to commit any Act of Ho&s;tility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Summons &s;ent to <HI>San|ta Maura.</HI></NOTE> he &s;ent to Summon the Place; and in a Wri|ting &s;et forth the Cau&s;e and Rea&s;ons which moved the <HI>Venetians</HI> to rai&s;e a powerful Army again&s;t the <HI>Turk,</HI> who had violated the Peace, by harbouring the Cor&s;aires of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and practi&s;ed other Ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Subjects of that State: And that in ca&s;e they did not Surrender up their Town and I&s;land, the next Morning he would proceed to force them, and make u&s;e of the Priviledge and Power of a Conqueror. To which the Go|vernour returned no other An&s;wer, Than that God would puni&s;h the <HI>Venetians</HI> for viola|ting the Peace, and making an unju&s;t War upon the Grand Seignior. Whereupon, the Admiral-Flag being &s;pread, which was the Signal of Battle, the Gallies and Gallea&s;&s;es made above Twelve hundred Shot again&s;t the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Batte|ries.</NOTE> which did great Damage to the Hou&s;es and Fortifications, and entirely rui|ned one of the Mo&s;chs. Nor were the <HI>Turks</HI> idle, but fired continually, th&ocirc; with no great hurt; for their Cannon being mounted too high, did not hinder the Forces of the Pope, <HI>Malta</HI> and <HI>To&s;cany</HI> from po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves of the Suburbs, nor the Batteries from rai&s;ing, which by direction of <HI>Lorenzo Venier,</HI> plaid on the Walls with good Succe&s;s, and did great Execution, and the Bombs which were thrown into the Town put all the Defendants into a Con&s;ter|nation. For, on the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Bat|teries had razed a Bulwark to the Ground, and widned the Breach, and di&s;mounted four Pieces of the Enemies Cannon, and the Bombs had &s;et Fire to &s;everal parts of the Town; and &s;o far was the Siege carried on, in order to a general A&s;&s;ault, that on the 6th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> hung out a white Flag, as a Signal that they would Capitulate: Accordingly a Treaty was had, and Ho&s;tages given, and at length an A|greement was concluded, That the <HI>Turks</HI> with their Families might have Liberty to leave the Town, with &s;o much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> parly and &s;urrender</NOTE> and no more than they could carry on their Backs.

The <HI>Venetians</HI> entred the Town at the Breach; the Plunder whereof, which was con&s;iderable, was gi|ven to the Soldiers: In the Place great &s;tore of Provi&s;ions were found, with Eighty Pie|ces of Cannon: The <HI>Venetians</HI> lo&s;t about Two hundred Men in the Siege: <HI>Moro|&s;ini</HI> immediately cau&s;ed the principal Mo&s;ch to be Ble&s;&s;ed, in which <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung, and dedicated to St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> becau&s;e it was the 6th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> on which day is the Fea&s;t of the Trasfiguration, when the <HI>Turks</HI> hung out the white Flag of Surrender.

<P>The Fortifications of <HI>Santa Maura</HI> being repaired, and a Gari&s;on left in it; General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> &s;et Sail to the Port of <HI>Petula,</HI> and thence to the Port of <HI>Dragonetta,</HI> where he ca&s;t Anchor, and landed his Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of Two thou&s;and <HI>Venetians,</HI> about One thou&s;and of the Pope's Auxiliaries, and about Fifteen, or Sixteen hundred <HI>Greeks.</HI> This Army advanced on the Plains; upon approach of which, &s;everal Turki&s;h Troops, which were employed to defend Pa&s;&s;ages, re|tired without any Re&s;i&s;tance, which gave opportunity to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to Burn four or five Villages; which having done, they returned to the Fleet and re-embarked them|&s;elves. At the &s;ame time General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> with his Gally got &s;ight of <HI>Patras</HI> and <HI>Le|panto;</HI> and thence Sailing to the Port of <HI>Damata,</HI> a Council of War was called, and there it was re&s;olved to Attack <HI>Preveza,</HI> without which <HI>Santa Maura</HI> could not be &s;ecured: <HI>Preveza</HI> is a Fortre&s;s which now &s;tands in the place of the ancient <HI>Nicopolis</HI> of <HI>Epirus,</HI> the Situation of which is very Commodious, for it Commands the entrance into the Gulf, and was anciently the Royal City of <HI>Pyrrhus.</HI> This Enterprize being re|&s;olved, General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> di&s;peeded five Gal|lies and &s;ix Gallea&s;&s;es to approach the Ca|&s;tles of the <HI>Gomenizze,</HI> which being di&s;cern|ed by the <HI>Turks</HI> from <HI>Preveza,</HI> they &s;ent back tho&s;e Soldiers which they had lately drawn from thence, on &s;uppo&s;ition that the <HI>Venetians</HI> would make all their Attempt upon <HI>Preveza;</HI> which happened according to the De&s;ire and Intention of <HI>Moro&s;ini,</HI> who&s;e Aim it was to divide their Forces. The Army in the mean time having left <HI>Damata,</HI> came to an Anchor on the 20th of <HI>September,</HI> at the entrance into the Gulf; and the next day Captain <HI>Manetta,</HI> with Twenty four Barks, and &s;ome Brigantines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preveza <HI>at|tacked.</HI></NOTE> entring the Gulf, landed part of his Forces; which the <HI>Turks</HI> in vain endeavoured to hinder by great and &s;mall Shot; and next Morning, by break of Day, the Gallies (which had anchored under the Hill of <HI>Ma|homet Effendi</HI>) appeared within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the Place, which gave a Diver&s;ion to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who having drawn all their Forces to that &s;ide, gave opportunity to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Forces to land on the other without much Annoyance, under the Conduct of General <HI>Strazoldo,</HI> which Errour, &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Turks</HI> di&s;covered, <HI>Shaban</HI> Pa&s;ha the Gover|nour immediately ordered Five hundred Spahees to ride full &s;peed to Attack the For|ces before they were landed; but before they could come, they found the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> already drawn up in Battalia, upon whom having made &s;ome &s;light Charge, they retreat|ed again in di&s;order with the lo&s;s of &s;everal of their Men.</P>

<P>On the 8th, The <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> Sprang a Mine under one of the Towers, where the <HI>Turks</HI> had placed their principal Battery; and at Night Sprang three or four more under the Curtain, but not with &s;o good effect as was expected: How&s;oever, they had brought their Attacks to the very Ditches of the Town and Ca&s;tle, and had made a Lodg|ment upon one of the Breaches.</P>
<P>On the 9th and 10th, Several other Mines were fired with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that they overthrew a great part of the Wall, and opened &s;o wide a &s;pace, that four or five Carts might enter a-brea&s;t: How&s;oe|ver, it was not thought advi&s;able to make an A&s;&s;ault, by Rea&s;on that the Defendants had formed &s;everal Retrenchments within, and guarded them with many Troops and Batteries: And be&s;ides, the Infantry were &s;o weakned by Di&s;&s;enteries, and other Sick|ne&s;&s;es, that it was not thought fit to hazard them upon &s;o de&s;perate an Attempt.

<P>If the Garri&s;on of <HI>Buda</HI> were in a bad Condition, the Imperial Camp in the Lea|guer was not in a much better; for mo&s;t of the Officers were either killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill Con|dition of the Lea|guer.</NOTE> &s;ick or wounded; and &s;uch was the &s;carcity of all Provi&s;ions, cau&s;ed by the Ob&s;tructions which the <HI>Seraskier</HI> had laid in the way to inter|cept the Convoys, which fetched them from far di&s;tant Places, that the proportion of Meat, and weight of Bread, di&s;tributed to every Soldier, was much dimini&s;h'd; &s;o that the Siege had then been rai&s;ed had not the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> (as we have &s;aid) come to the Camp on the 9th of <HI>September,</HI> with his Infantry, which gave new Hopes and Encouragement to continue the Siege; th&ocirc; the Death of General <HI>Dunewaldt</HI> in his Tent, who had the Reputation of a valiant and an experienced Soldier, did very much add to the Sorrow and Di&s;couragement of the Camp.</P>
<P>Still did the <HI>Turks</HI> continue to make their Sallies with much Bravery, in one of which they &s;piked or nailed three Pieces of Can|non.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sallies made by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> The Prince of <HI>Saxony Ei&s;enach</HI> had his Leg taken off with a great Shot, and General <HI>Kops</HI> fighting valiantly at the Head of his Men was wounded, and died &s;hortly afterwards in his Tent. But it was very ob&s;ervable, how Forty &s;tout <HI>Turks,</HI> naked to the Wa&s;t, behaved them&s;elves with two-handed broad Swords, hewing and cutting down all before them; they advanced as far as to the River-&s;ide, and having covered the Ground with dead Bodies, they return|ed with the lo&s;s of few of their number in|to the Town.</P>
<P>The Reinforcement which the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> brought to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Camp, put the <HI>Turks</HI> into an Apprehen&s;ion that the Town would certainly be taken, unle&s;s it were relieved by &s;ome &s;ignal Succe&s;s of the <HI>Seraskier</HI>'s Army within the Lines of the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;peedily de&s;ign|ed &s;o &s;oon as they were reinforced by &s;ome Troops, which were daily expected.

The <HI>Seraskier</HI> ac|cordingly marched with about 25.000 Men, or at mo&s;t 27.000 to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and en|camped before the Town, with intention very &s;peedily to di&s;turb the Siege; but hearing that the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was come thither with a very con&s;iderable Force, he altered his De&s;ign, and marched towards the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> to fight tho&s;e Troops which were &s;ent thither under the Command of Count <HI>Erdedi,</HI> the General of <HI>Croatia,</HI> and to hinder them from burning the Bridge, or taking the Forts which covered it.

<P>In the mean the Batteries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bavari|ans</HI> ad|vance their Works.</NOTE> which the <HI>Ba|varians</HI> had rai&s;ed, had begun to open a wide Breach; and on that &s;ide by the Wa|ter, their Works were advanced one third in length of the lower Town; and &s;everal Redoubts were perfected to impede and di|&s;turb the <HI>Seraskier</HI> in his March from <HI>Alba
<PB N="151" REF="85"> Regalis,</HI> towards the Siege of <HI>Buda:</HI> The Expectations were great of the coming of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Hor&s;e, and other Cavalry from the parts near <HI>Presburg,</HI> under the Command of Count <HI>Caraffa,</HI> and al&s;o of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Infantry, which were now much wanted at this Siege.</P>
<P>The Rains which fell in &s;uch great abun|dance on the 18th at Night, did greatly retard the progre&s;s of the Works which the <HI>Bavarians</HI> were making, th&ocirc; their Batteries had good effect upon that Angle, which was contiguous to the Tower on the Ca|&s;tle &s;ide; but the Approaches appeared dai|ly more difficult than before, and the Works on the River-&s;ide proceeded &s;lowly, and on the &s;ide of the Curtain, the Miners were not able to advance above three Pikes in length.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> being returned to the Camp, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> who had the At|tack by the River-&s;ide, &s;prang a Mine un|der the Tower with &s;o good Succe&s;s, that it overthrew a great part of the Wall, with one of the Gates: They al&s;o made a Line of Communication, which joyned their At|tack with that of Count <HI>Maximilian de Sta|remberg:</HI> The Defendants at the &s;ame time made &s;everal Attempts to enter the Lines of <HI>Bavarians,</HI> but could not prevail, by rea&s;on that the Entrance was &s;trongly fortify'd; and farther, to defend them&s;elves, they made &s;everal Retrenchments within the Town, and pulled down &s;everal Hou&s;es, covered the Streets with Beams to ca&s;t off Granadoes, and hinder the Bombs from do|ing hurt and damage to the Hou&s;es. The 20th of this Month the Defendants had the good fortune to &s;eize a Boat laden with Provi&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Be&s;ieg|ed take a Boat with Provi&s;ions.</NOTE> as it was going to the Imperial Camp, which cau&s;ed much Joy in the City, whereby the Report which &s;ome Fugitives made of the &s;carcity and want of Provi&s;ions in the Place, was clearly confirmed: And the &s;ame day a Party of Fifteen hundred <HI>Turks</HI> attacked &s;ome Foragers &s;ent from the Leaguer, of whom they killed &s;everal, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners, with the laden Wag|gons, the re&s;t making their E&s;cape as well as they could.</P>
<P>In fine, the <HI>Seraskier</HI> being re&s;olved once more to attempt the Relief of <HI>Buda,</HI> rai&s;ed his Camp on the 21&s;t from under the Walls of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and began his March; of which the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> having Advice by a <HI>Polonian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sera|skier</HI> en|deavours to rai&s;e the Siege.</NOTE> who was e&s;caped out of the Hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> immediately drew out his Forces into the appointed Places, and with &s;uch Order, as was lately agreed at a Council of War, where they attended all day for the coming of the Enemy; which not appearing, the Forces drew off towards the Evening into their &s;everal Quarters, ha|ving been greatly incommoded by the Rains, which had continued all that day to fall in &s;uch abundance. How&s;oever, the day fol|lowing, Two thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> attacked the Lines in two places with much Re&s;olution, endeavouring to force their Pa&s;&s;age into the Town; but finding great Re&s;i&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sally ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Town.</NOTE> they were beaten off with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, lea|ving two Standards in the Hands of the Imperiali&s;ts. Whil&s;t this Attack was made, Fifteen Hundred Hor&s;e and Foot made a Sally out of the Town, and cleared all the Trenches before them, and advanced to the very Batteries, killing about Two hundred Men; but &s;ome Squadrons coming to their Relief, forced them back with the lo&s;s of Four hundred Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seraskier,</HI> who was retreated to his Camp about two Leagues di&s;tant from the Siege, kept the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in a continual Alarum, and on the 23d made as if he would have attempted the Lines once more; but the Mettle of the <HI>Turks</HI> was not &s;o warm and hot as formerly; how&s;oever, Four hundred of their Men wading over a mar&s;hy Ground, up to the Armpits in Mire and Water, found a Way, which before that time, was e&s;teemed unpa&s;&s;able; and got in|to the Town, except &s;ome few, who, &s;tick|ing in the Mire, were birded off and killed with Mu&s;quet-&s;hot.</P>
<P>By this time the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Troops being come, with three <HI>German</HI> Regiments from <HI>Bohemia,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> e&s;teemed him&s;elf in a Condition able to engage the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, and &s;o marching out of the Lines with a con&s;iderable Body, he follow|ed the Enemy, and provoked them to a Battle; but the <HI>Seraskier</HI> having already performed his De&s;ign, by putting &s;ome Men into the Town, he declined the Fight, &s;o that the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> without other Action returned again to the Siege; but before they entred the Lines, the Garri&s;on made a de&s;perate Sally both with Hor&s;e and Foot, and with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that they drove the Be&s;iegers out of their Trenches, filled up &s;ome of their Works with Earth, levelled one of their Batteries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sally out of the Towe.</NOTE> and killed above Three hundred Men upon the Place; and after having routed the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> they fell in upon the Quarters of the Imperia|li&s;ts, who being le&s;s hara&s;&s;ed than the o|thers, gave them a Repul&s;e with equal lo&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 25th the <HI>Seraskier</HI> appeared a third time in &s;ight of the Leaguer, &s;hewing as if he intended to offer Battle; upon ap|pearance of which, the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> drew out of their Lines; but whil&s;t they were rang|ing them&s;elves into a po&s;ture of Battle, a Detachment of Four thou&s;and Hor&s;e were di&s;peeded under covert of the Hills, and

As the Spi|rits of the Be&s;iegers were Drooping and Fainting without, &s;o the many Succe&s;&s;es of tho&s;e within, filled them full of hopes of a &s;peedy delivery; for they had lately taken &s;o many Boats laden with Provi&s;ions de&s;ign|ed for the Chri&s;tian Camp, that their wants of nece&s;&s;ary Su&s;tenance were &s;upplyed. And on the 29th, Some De&s;erters from the Chri&s;tian Camp di&s;cover'd to them &s;everal Mines which were preparing again&s;t them, by which intimation they opened the Earth, found and di&s;armed them of their Powder, which was &s;o great a di&s;appoint|ment and di&s;couragement to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that it was e&s;teemed by the mo&s;t experien|ced Commanders almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to gain the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffi|culties of gaining the Town.</NOTE> in regard the Sea&s;on of the Year was &s;pent, and the Winter already enter'd.</P>
<P>In Con&s;ideration of which, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> a&s;&s;embled a Council of War to de|liberate concerning the Re&s;olutions, which were to be taken in the pre&s;ent Exigency and Conjuncture of Affairs: At which time Prince <HI>Erman</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Council of War at <HI>Vienna,</HI> arrived in the Camp, having been di&s;patched by the Em|peror, with Commi&s;&s;ion to Command the <HI>German</HI> Infantry, during the Sickne&s;s of the two Counts of <HI>Staremberg;</HI> and with In|&s;tructions and Orders al&s;o to the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> to rai&s;e the Siege, in ca&s;e there was not a certainty, or at lea&s;t &s;ome probable hopes of reducing the Town in a very &s;hort term of time; for that his Imperial Maje&s;ty de&s;ired not to con&s;ume his Forces in a de|&s;perate and fruitle&s;s Enterpri&s;e.

In the fir&s;t place therefore, the Winter-quarters were agreed and a&s;&s;igned by the Council, &s;o that the Troops might know, unto what Towns they were to march; then all the Heavy Cannon, Morter-pieces and Bombs were order'd to be carried away and &s;ecur'd.</P>

<P>But if we look into the Winter-quarters before we Treat of the Feats of War, which were Actions mo&s;t fit for the Summer Sea|&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mi&s;era|ble Plague and Famin.</NOTE> we &s;hall find the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Ba|varians</HI> &s;o mi&s;erably in want of all Provi|&s;ions, and of things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;te|nance of Human Life: That one would wonder, how it were po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e Men to be &s;o &s;oon recover'd, and made fit for new Services and Fatigues. For &s;uch was the Famine in the Lower <HI>Hungary,</HI> that the Inhabitants were forced to Abandon their Dwellings, and Fly for Bread into the Town of <HI>Buda;</HI> where they were enter|tained for Day-labourers to Repair the For|tifications, with the Wages of eight pence a Day, two pounds weight of Bread, and a pint of Wine. In the Emperour's Coun|try, a Bu&s;hel of Wheat, which in the times of Peace, was worth no more than ten Groats, was now advanced in price to Eighteen &s;hillings. In <HI>Presbourg</HI> the Streets were cover'd with fami&s;hed and dying Peo|ple; the Soldiers were either Dead or Lan|gui&s;hing, or had de&s;erted their Colours: A Pe&s;tilence, as is natural, followed the Fa|mine, and Cattle died of the Murrain. The I&s;land <HI>Schultz,</HI> which u&s;ed to be the Grana|ry of the Upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> was now in a Starving condition, and the Inhabitants for|ced to Eat Roots and the Barks of Trees: Nay, this Mi&s;ery and De&s;olation extended even to <HI>Vienna</HI> it &s;elf, where in the Garden of the Archbi&s;hop, two Women were &s;een to Eat the Raw-fle&s;h of a Hor&s;e lately Dead.

How&s;oever, <HI>Tekeli</HI> made a &s;econd adven|ture for the Succour of <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> and with a Party of Three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, he made way for a Convoy of Three hundred Carts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Convoy brought thither.</NOTE> laden with all &s;orts of Ammuniti|on and Provi&s;ions, with as many Hor&s;e, each carrying a Sack of Meal to enter into the Town: In the &s;trength and encourage|ment of which, the Garri&s;on made Incur|&s;ions at four and five Leagues di&s;tance, Plundering and De&s;troying all before them, which cau&s;ed the poor Inhabitants to aban|don their Dwellings, and &s;eek for Succour and Refuge in fortified places. Not long afterwards a &s;econd Convoy brought Two thou&s;and Sacks more of Meal into the Town, which with the former were good Preparations again&s;t a Siege; but to pre|vent the like for the future, Count <HI>Palfi,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Troops, was order'd to joyn with Colonel <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> who having but Two or Three thou&s;and Men, was &s;o unable to guard the Avenues to <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> that the Blocade &s;eemed of no importance: But <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> being thus con|&s;iderably reinforced, he defeated a third Convoy which the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;ending to the Town, con&s;i&s;ting of Eighty Waggons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Con|voys.</NOTE> which carried Ammunitions and Provi&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and Sixty more of Timber for Building and Repair of the Fortifications.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the advantage which <HI>Te|keli</HI> had gained over General <HI>Schultz</HI> before <HI>E&s;peries,</HI> and given it &s;ome Relief; yet the Town laboured under great want of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Convoy &s;ent to Re|lieve <HI>E&s;pe|ries,</HI> taken.</NOTE> to &s;upply which <HI>Tekeli</HI> &s;ent a &s;trong Convoy to &s;upport the place with Grain Fle&s;h, Pul&s;e and all things required for a Siege: But <HI>Schultz</HI> recovering his Forces, and animated with de&s;ire of Revenge, watch|ed his opportunity to fall on the Convoy, which he charged with &s;uch Vigour and Bravery, that he killed Three hundred on the place, took all their Carriages, with great quantities <HI>Tokay</HI> Wine.</P>

<P>The Sea&s;on of the Year being now well advanc'd, and the Weather become mild and &s;it for Action; the Imperial Troops from the Hereditary Countries, with the Auxiliaries and Bands of Voluntiers, com|po&s;ed of divers Nations, began to de&s;cend from <HI>Moravia,</HI> and with their Officers to march towards the place of General Ren|devous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The place of General Render|vous.</NOTE> appointed in the Plains between <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> and <HI>Barkan,</HI> being e&s;teemed the mo&s;t convenient Situation for Atchieving any Enterpri&s;e, according to the Re&s;olu|tions of a Council of War.

<P>About the beginning of <HI>May</HI> General <HI>Palfi</HI> was order'd to march into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and joyn with Colonel <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> at the Blo|cade of <HI>Newhau&s;el;</HI> which they &s;o &s;treight|ned, that the Pa&s;ha Governour of that place, turn'd out all u&s;ele&s;s Per&s;ons out of the Town, who were not capable to bear Arms, and &s;o many of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> as &s;erved only to con&s;ume and le&s;&s;en the Provi&s;ions, and not defend the Town: By the&s;e Per&s;ons the Commanders received information, that the Garri&s;on con|&s;i&s;ted only of Two or Three thou&s;and <HI>Jani|&s;aries,</HI> of which a great number was Sick and Infirm.</P>

<P>At this time that <HI>Palfi</HI> and <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> were emploied in Blocking up <HI>Newhau&s;el,</HI> Gener|al <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> departed from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Gratz,</HI> from whence he drew his Forces into the Field in order to march into <HI>Croatia,</HI> where he was to Command this Year, with a Rein|forcement of Seven thou&s;and Men more than he had the la&s;t.</P>
<P>General <HI>Schultz,</HI> who had newly di&s;tribu|ted a Hundred thou&s;and Florins among&s;t his Soldiers, finding them Couragious and in good Heart, was re&s;olved to begin the Campaign with the notable Exploit of lay|ing Siege to <HI>Ungwar,</HI> a &s;mall, but the Capi|tal City of the County of <HI>Ung,</HI> in which <HI>Tekeli</HI> had placed a &s;trong Garri&s;on.

Upon this News, the Male-contents, with a great Bo|dy, came to relieve the Place; but General <HI>Schultz</HI> bravely encountred them, gave them a Repul&s;e, and took three of their Stan|dards; and returning with this Succe&s;s back to the Siege, he was ready to give Fire unto a Mine, when News came that <HI>Tekeli</HI> having joyned him&s;elf to a &s;trong Body of <HI>Tartars,</HI> was marching again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schultz</HI> for|ced to leave the Town.</NOTE> he rai|&s;ed the Siege with &s;o much Ha&s;t and Pre|cipitation, that he was con&s;trained to leave the greate&s;t part of his Artillery behind him, after he had lo&s;t Nine hundred Men, which were killed, and Two hundred wound|ed; among&s;t which was Count <HI>Strafoldo,</HI> who was &s;hot through the Arm with a Mu&s;quet-bullet, and Baron <HI>Arti</HI> his Lieute|nant Colonel, was wounded likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> when the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> appointed General of the Imperial and Confederate Forces, with ab|&s;olute Power and Authority from the Empe|ror, came to the Army, which was encamped near unto <HI>Gran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Council of War called.</NOTE> where a Council of War was held, and therein diver&s;ely debated, whether they &s;hould begin this Campaign with the Siege of <HI>Novigrade,</HI> which would interrupt all Communication between <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Newhau&s;el;</HI> or return again to <HI>Buda,</HI> where the Fortifications were not as yet ful|ly repaired, nor the Inhabitants totally freed from the dread and fear of their late Dan|ger; but upon farther examination of this Matter, it was made to appear, that <HI>Buda</HI> was in a much better Condition than it was before the Siege;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> for that the Fortifications were all fini&s;hed, and made better and &s;tronger than they were formerly; that the new Governour had demoli&s;hed all the Hou|&s;es, which had been ruined and defaced by the Bombs, and totally de&s;troyed the Su|burbs;

<P>During the time that a con&s;iderable Force was employ'd to ob&s;erve the Motion of the Seraskier, the Siege was carried on with all imaginable Courage and Re&s;olution; the Cannon continually fired from the &s;everal Batteries, and the Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es were thrown into the Fortre&s;s with &s;uch good Succe&s;s, that on the 22d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town on Fire.</NOTE> the Town appear'd to Smoak and Flame in three &s;ever|al places, which continued all Night, to the great Terrour and Labour of the Defen|dants: But at length by the great Rains which fell, the Fires were not only extin|gui&s;hed, but the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> very much in|commoded in their Trenches, and the Wa|ters of the Ditch increa&s;ed, as fa&s;t almo&s;t as they were &s;unk by the Drain: So that it &s;eeming a long and tedious Work, before the Ditch could be emptied of it's Water; a contrivance was made to pa&s;s a Miner over the Ditch in a Boat, and &s;ix it to the Breach in the Wall; but the Boat recei|ving a Shot from the Town, was ready to &s;ink, and tho&s;e therein were &s;o incommo|ded with &s;howers of Stones from the &s;mal|ler Guns, and Petreras planted on the Walls, that they were forced to Retire, and give over that De&s;ign.</P>

Nor did the Gallery on the left Hand fare any thing better, for the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hot &s;uch numbers of Arrows with artificial Fires into it, that nothing could re&s;i&s;t the violence of the Flames: All the Gallery took Fire, with the Parapet and Neighbouring Battery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Galle|ries and Batteries burnt.</NOTE> and burn'd with &s;uch fiercene&s;s, that it became too hot for the Guards, and di&s;mounted four Pieces of Cannon. The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> came immediately in Per&s;on to the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the place, and remained where the Fire was mo&s;t impetuous, commanding the Officers to march their Troops to that place; and in the mean time employed all his Servants and Attendants, who were a|bout him, even his very Pages to &s;top and extingui&s;h the Fire. The Example of the General was &s;o prevalent, that every one gave a helping hand, with &s;uch diligence and vigour, that the Fire was extingui&s;hed, and a great part of the Battery was &s;aved, with the Cannon and Powder: Whil&s;t this Action was doing, all tho&s;e who work'd about the Fire lay open to the &s;hot of the Enemy, of which about Sixty Soldiers were killed, and twelve of them near to the Per|&s;on of the Duke, who expo&s;ed him&s;elf without fear to the utmo&s;t Peril of his Life.</P>
<P>The Fire being extingui&s;hed, Order was given to repair the Damage which the Fire had done; which accordingly was execu|ted with &s;uch diligence, that on the next Night following the Parapet was repaired, and the Cannon being remounted began a|gain to Batter the Town; new Galleries were al&s;o making of &s;uch matter, as &s;hould not be &s;o ea&s;ily combu&s;tible as the former.</P>

The Seraskier ob&s;erving the di&s;order of his left Wing, advanced with a &s;trong Body of <HI>Turks</HI> to charge the utmo&s;t part of the right Wing of the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> to &s;u&s;tain which, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> re|doubled the firing of the fir&s;t Line, and commanded Count <HI>Dunewald</HI> to reinforce the fir&s;t Line with &s;uch Squadrons and Bat|talions of the &s;econd Line, as were neare&s;t unto it. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> coming at the &s;ame time to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, put the <HI>Turks</HI> into a di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and afterwards forced them to make a Retreat, and draw a little off. The <HI>Hungarian</HI> Troops which were accu&s;tomed to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> man|ner of Fighting, were order'd to charge them in the Rear; which having done, they wheel'd about and made a &s;tand.

<PB N="170" REF="96"> not knowing whether he might be de|&s;irous to be pre&s;ent at this great Action, to add the Subjection of this Place to the Glo|ry of his late Victory: But the great Mind of the Duke, which was zealous for the Service of the Emperor, and the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, gave orders not to defer the A&s;&s;ault for one Moment; but fir&s;t to advi&s;e the Be&s;ieged of the defeat of their Seraskier, and to verify the &s;ame by &s;ome Pri&s;oners taken in the late Battle, which were &s;ent into the Town, that being informed of their de&s;|perate Condition, they might be induced to accept Terms of Mercy for their Lives. The 18th was the Day appointed for this Attempt, but the Rains were &s;o violent, that it was thought fit to expect more fa|vourable Weather, and to break &s;ome Pali|&s;adoes with the Cannon, which were newly erected within the Breach.

<P>In the Town Eighty Pieces of Cannon were taken, with great quantities of Am|munition.

<P>The Advice of taking <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> was brought to the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> whil&s;t he was in Di&s;cour&s;e with the Elector of <HI>Bava|ria,</HI> and the other Generals, of carrying on the Wars with &s;uch other Enterpri&s;e, as might conclude and terminate this Cam|paign with the greater Glory.

The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Slaves, which, on occa&s;ion of the late Defeat, had e&s;caped out of the hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> came in great numbers to <HI>New|hau&s;el,</HI> and there related, how that the Se|raskier

<P>We having not thought fit to interrupt the Relation of two &s;uch great Matters, as the Fight near <HI>Strigonium,</HI> and the Siege of <HI>Newhau&s;al,</HI> with a Digre&s;&s;ion unto other A|ctions; which being now pa&s;t, let us look back, and behold the Progre&s;s which Count <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> and General <HI>Schultz</HI> were making a|gain&s;t the Common Enemy in different Places. <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> being advanced into the Country near <HI>Kani&s;ia,</HI> had the good for|tune to meet a Party of <HI>Turks,</HI> belonging to that place, which he defeated, and with the Slaughter of &s;everal hundred of them, cau|&s;ed the re&s;t to Fly into their Fortre&s;s.

With the good News of this Succe&s;s, Prince <HI>Deichtre&s;tein</HI> was di&s;patched to the Emperor, and for Confirmation there|of, he carried with him five Colours of the Fourteen, which were taken from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

On the Walls were found Thirty Pieces of Cannon mounted, with a Mortar-piece car|rying Sixty pounds Weight, and &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Cannon Bullets, the greate&s;t part of which were Ca&s;t by the Imperiali&s;ts in the time of the late Siege;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi&s;ions and Am|munition in the Town.</NOTE> when the Town was taken by <HI>Tekeli</HI> in the Year 1678.

<HEAD>THE Venetian Succe&s;&s;es AGAINST The TURKS, 1685.</HEAD>
<P> <MILESTONE N="1685"> WHILST the <HI>Morlaques</HI> re|tained in the Service of the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> made frequent Incur&s;ions and Spoyls on the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia;</HI> The <HI>Mai|niotes,</HI> (who are another &s;ort of People, much like the <HI>Morlaques</HI>) being animated with the Venetian Succe&s;&s;es, began to take up Arms again&s;t the <HI>Turks:</HI> But for better under&s;tanding of what is to follow, we will de&s;cribe a little the Countries and Humours of the&s;e two People.

But whil&s;t they were Capitulating on this Preliminary, it unfortunately happened out, that two Sol|diers quarrelling together a Pi&s;tol was &s;hot off, and the Bandeliers of another Soldier took Fire, which gave &s;uch an Alarum to the Be&s;ieged, that they cryed out Treache|ry, and therewith fired one of their Cannon planted at the entrance of the Breach, la|den with &s;mall &s;hot, which killed &s;everal that were mounted thereon:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coron</HI> ta|ken by Storm.</NOTE> This Accident was &s;ufficient to put an end to the Treaty, and incen&s;e the Soldiery, who tran&s;ported with Fury, broke into the middle of the Town, and with mi&s;erable &s;laughter put Men, Women and Children to the Sword, without any re&s;pect either to Age, or Sex.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Siege of <HI>Coron,</HI> on the 11th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which was Seven and forty Days after the Trenches were opened. It was a Bloody Day to both &s;ides.

After which <HI>Te Deum</HI> being Sung, with other Hymns of Prai&s;es, and Thanks to Almighty God, the Captain General em|braced all the Chief Officers with much af|fection and kindne&s;s, as namely the two Princes of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> and all the others in their &s;everal Degrees: He declar'd, That Count St. <HI>Paul</HI> with his <HI>Venetians</HI> had gained much Honour; That the young Count of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in a particular manner; That the Forces of <HI>Florence</HI> had given good proofs of their Valour, to the time of their Departure, which was &s;ome Days before the end of the Siege.

And whereas there were &s;everal Murmu|ings among&s;t the People, and in the Army e&s;pecially, again&s;t the Vizier for not going to the War; he publickly de&s;ired the Grand Seignior's leave and commands to go; to which when the Sultan &s;eem'd inclinable, the Council unanimou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it, repre&s;ent|ing that it was never accu&s;tomary, nor de|cent for the Emperor, to &s;end his Repre&s;en|tative with his Seal and Authority without a Royal Army, or without expectation of performing &s;ome Signal Enterprize: And that on any other Terms or Circum&s;tances than the&s;e, his going would be Prejudical and Di&s;honourable: It was farther alledged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excu&s;es for not going to the War.</NOTE> That the attendance on the Vizier would con&s;i&s;t of many u&s;ele&s;s Mouths, and the oc|ca&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s draw many Followers to his Court, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;ume a great part of tho&s;e Provi&s;ions, which would be more u&s;efully emploied for the u&s;e and &s;u&s;tenance of the Camp.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t Excu&s;e of all, was the ill &s;tate of the Vizier's health; concerning which there were various Reports; &s;ometimes it was &s;aid, that he was de&s;perately ill, then again that he was recover'd, then that he was re|lap&s;ed; &s;ome &s;aid, that he was Sick in Po|licy, others in Reality; but what &s;eemed mo&s;t probable was, that he was afflicted with the Spleen, by rea&s;on of which all kind of ill News made a &s;en&s;ible alteration in him: The Cares which con&s;tantly tor|mented him, kept his Mind always bent, and increa&s;ed the pain in his Side, which kept him from Repo&s;e: The&s;e matters with Sixty &s;ix years of Age, were Afflictions &s;ufficient to weary out, and hara&s;s a Body much more &s;trong and robu&s;t than his.

But to give a &s;top to this Se|dition, and Nip it in the Bud, the Vizier immediately &s;ent his <HI>Kaiah</HI> with all his Re|tinue, and <HI>Janizar-Aga</HI> to the place where they were a&s;&s;embled, not far di&s;tant from the City; Twenty of them were taken and &s;ent to the Grand Seignior, who cau&s;ed four of their Heads to be cut off, and the other Sixteen were &s;ent to the Gallies; and two of their Chief Officers were Bani&s;hed to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> for keeping no better Order among&s;t their Men; all the re&s;t were di&s;per&s;ed, and in an hour's time the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s was over; and in a few Days afterwards, tho&s;e who were bani&s;hed, and tho&s;e who were &s;ent to the Gallies were recalled and re&s;tor'd to their places, and all of them contented|ly, and in good order marched towards <HI>Hungary.</HI> But they had not proceeded far on their way before advices came, that af|ter <HI>Ibrahim</HI> Pa&s;ha's defeat near <HI>Strigonium,</HI> there had aro&s;e differences and di&s;turban|ces between the <HI>Spahees</HI> and <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> to &s;uppre&s;s which <HI>Ibrahim</HI> had cut off &s;everal of them: Whereupon it being not thought fit to &s;uffer the&s;e Mutinous <HI>Spahees,</HI> to joyn with the di&s;contented Parties, a &s;top was put to their March; until &s;uch time as <HI>Agiemzade,</HI> a grave and wi&s;e Per&s;on, one who had formerly been <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> or Secretary of State, was &s;ent to the Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> with a Sum of Money to ap|pea&s;e the Mutinies, and &s;often the Minds of the Soldiery. The&s;e little di&s;turbances cau&s;ed the People to talk, and brought the Vizier's name upon their Tongues: And tho&s;e who pretended to be Politicians di&s;|cour&s;ed, That this Empire had been rai&s;ed, and &s;upported by the Soldiery; and that from them de&s;erving Per&s;ons had been pro|moted, and advanced to the high Degrees of Viziers and Generals; and not from Para&s;ites and Syphcoants, or from effeminate Courtiers and Favourites: And that the Grand Seignior, who diverted him&s;elf whol|ly in Hunting and with Women, neglecting the main concernments of the Empire was not like his Progenitors, who in Per&s;on marched at the Head of their Armies, and encouraged their Soldiers by their Pre&s;ence and Per&s;onal Valour: From &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e among&s;t the Commonalty, who reported much wor&s;e of their Affairs, than perhaps they were in reality, we may ex|pect &s;ome greater Changes for the en&s;uing Years: For the Army was become Cow|ardly and Mutinous, and running from the War more willingly than coming to it; and the Common People affected with a &s;trange Super&s;tition, that Fortune will change with exchange of Officers.</P>
<P>But before we put an end to this Year 1685, let us a little return once more into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and take a view of what was acting in the Upper parts of that Kingdom; where the Succe&s;s of the Imperial Arms had produced &s;uch Dread and Terrour in the Minds of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Malecontents,</HI> that many places yielded at the fir&s;t Summons, or at the appearance of an Army before them: In this manner <HI>Potak, Regentz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several places be|longing to <HI>Tekeli</HI> &s;ur|render.</NOTE> <HI>Ungwar</HI> and <HI>Serau,</HI> all Garri&s;ons belonging to <HI>Tekeli,</HI> yielded without one Blow, and received the Imperial Troops, which being welcom'd with real Joy by the Inhabitants, the Mi|litary Parol was maintained, and not the lea&s;t injury or damage offer'd to the People. The Surrender of the&s;e Places were leading Cards to <HI>Senetz, Valdachin,</HI> and to the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Sonna, Annoin, Pallotz, Duron, Spadiz, Joram, Hinghen, Zatmar</HI> and other places, which &s;ubmitted to Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> and wil|lingly received <HI>German</HI> Garri&s;ons, and being pardon'd and ab&s;olved from their Rebellion by this General, they took a new Oath of Fidelity and Allegiance to the Emperor.</P>
<P>But that which chiefly facilitated the de|fection of the&s;e Places, was a report that <HI>Tekeli</HI> was &s;eized by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and lay chained at <HI>Waradin;</HI> the Fame of which had &s;ome Foundation; for the Seraskier <HI>Shitan Ibrahim</HI> having had very ill Succe&s;s the la&s;t Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tekeli</HI> in Di&s;grace.</NOTE> knew not where to charge the Fault, and excu&s;e him&s;elf better than by laying all the blame upon <HI>Tekeli;</HI> and to evidence his Re&s;entment, cau&s;ed him to be impri&s;oned at <HI>Waradin,</HI> until his Crimes were notified to the Court, and Orders gi|ven by the Grand Seignior for his Puni&s;h|ment. But <HI>Tekeli</HI> by his Agents had &s;o well mannaged his Cau&s;e before the Divan, that he was fairly acquitted from all Blame, and the Seraskier di&s;graced for his ra&s;h Judg|ment, as will hereafter be di&s;cour&s;ed more at large:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And recei|ved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">|vour.</NOTE> And indeed the Grand Seignior and his Council did wi&s;ely con&s;ider the great Intere&s;t of <HI>Tekeli</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and what Influence his pre&s;ent Di&s;grace had al|ready had over the many Towns and Ca&s;tles which belonged to him, and which had Sur|render'd upon the Report only of the Im|pri&s;onment
<PB N="186" REF="104"> of their Prince; wherefore the Grand Seignior and his Council ha&s;ten'd, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, Orders to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Waradin</HI> for his Relea&s;e, and at the head of his Army to proclaim his Innocence, and repair his Honour; the which was accord|ingly performed, as appears by a Letter from <HI>Tekeli</HI> him&s;elf, dated the 4th of <HI>De|cember</HI> 1685, from <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> directed to his Wife, the Prince&s;s of <HI>Ragotzki,</HI> where|in al&s;o he &s;ignified his Intentions to return with the Spring into <HI>Hungary,</HI> with a Body of Fifteen thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and endeavour to recover tho&s;e Places which were revolted from him.

<P>We have formerly mentioned, that the ill Succe&s;s of the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> had cau&s;ed Mutinies in the Army, and that one <HI>Arem|zade,</HI> a grave and wi&s;e Per&s;on, was &s;ent with a Sum of Mony to appea&s;e the Sol|diery, and enquire into the Cau&s;e of the&s;e Di&s;turbances: The Matter being examined, a Report was made much to the Prejudice of <HI>Shaitan Ibrahim,</HI> by rea&s;on of the di&s;af|fection of the Soldiers and Commanders to him; for it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for a General to be unfortunate and beloved: When the Report was come to the hands of the Grand Seignior, the <HI>Capelar-kia&s;ee,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, was &s;peedily di&s;patched, with a Command to take off the Head of <HI>Shai|tan Ibraim,</HI> and to make <HI>Apti,</HI> then Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda,</HI> Seraskier or General in his place, and <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha, <HI>Ogli</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Buda;</HI> but <HI>O&s;man</HI>'s Head was cut off by <HI>Ibrahim</HI> three Days before the Order came: In return for which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shaitan I|brahim</HI> put to Death.</NOTE> <HI>Shaitan Ibrahim</HI>'s Head was brought to <HI>Adrianople</HI> the 6th of <HI>December.</HI> He had been in the greate&s;t Employments of the Em|pire for the &s;pace of forty Years, and render'd con&s;iderable and &s;ignal Services thereunto: One might have thought that his brave and valiant Defence of <HI>Buda,</HI> would have attoned for future Misfortunes; or that his Marri|age with the Grand Seignior's Si&s;ter de|ceas'd, and afterwards with his Aunt, would have been Intere&s;ts &s;ufficient for his Pro|tection; but the Grand Vizier feared him, and therefore was willing to wreak upon him all the Misfortunes of an unhappy Campaign, laying it to his Charge, that he had converted the Soldiers Pay to his own Profit: And &s;o he fell about the Eightieth Year of his Age, commi&s;erated by all, and according to the Character we have former|ly given of him, he might have de&s;erved a milder Fate.

<P>THE Grand Vizier being of a melan|choly pen&s;ive Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier's Di&s;temper.</NOTE> and much af|flicted with hypocondriacal Di&s;tempers, made his Thoughts more burden&s;om by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing

At the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> he was ill for the &s;pace of a Month; but when good News came, he recover'd again, and his political Di&s;ea&s;e had its cold and hot Fits, according to the changes and vici&s;&s;itude of Times. About the end of the la&s;t Year, or beginning of this, <HI>Soliman</HI> Pa|&s;ha, who was General of the Army again&s;t <HI>Poland,</HI> had not only defended the Confines, but wor&s;ted the <HI>Poles,</HI> and returned to <HI>A|drianople</HI> with much Applau&s;e; for it was now no le&s;s Glory for a General among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> to &s;ave his Army, and not be Overcome, than it was formerly to Con|quer. This was the Fortune and Honour of <HI>Soliman,</HI> for having brought off his Ar|my entire and unbroken; which was a piece of Service &s;o highly e&s;teemed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soliman</HI> Pa&s;ha's re|ception.</NOTE> that the Grand Vizier received him upon his arri|val, with all Honour and Appearances of real Friend&s;hip, &s;ending the Chiausba&s;hee and Chaou&s;es to conduct him to his Pre&s;ence, where at the &s;ame time were the <HI>Mufti,</HI> the Generals of the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> and <HI>Spahees,</HI> and other great Mini&s;ters of State a&s;&s;embled, and all congratulated the Honours and Glo|ries he had acquired; which Ceremonies being ended, all the&s;e great Per&s;ons (except the <HI>Mufti</HI>) attended <HI>Soliman</HI> to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> where the Grand Seignior received him with much Kindne&s;s, clothed him with a rich Ve&s;t of Sables, entertained him with a &s;plendid Banquet, and pre&s;ented him two Hor&s;es richly furni&s;hed: According to which Exam|ple, as is accu&s;tomary, all the great Men made him their Pre&s;ents; for whom the Sul|tan will Favour, the inferior Officers are obliged to Honour. The next Day <HI>Soli|man</HI> came to the Vizier's Palace, held a Divan, and acted all publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the Mouths of the Commonalty, he was cried up for Vizier <HI>Azem.</HI> And th&ocirc; what <HI>Soliman</HI> Pa&s;ha acted was only as an A&s;&s;i&s;t|ant or Coadjutor to the Vizier, during his Weakne&s;s and Infirmity; yet <HI>Soliman</HI> got &s;o much ground in E&s;teem of the Sultan, and of the People, that the Vizier thought it time to rouze up his Spirits, and to act every thing by his own Per&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier jea|lous of <HI>So|liman.</HI></NOTE> And to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the danger of being &s;up|planted by &s;o powerful a Rival, he addre&s;&s;ed a Memorial to the Grand Seignior, where|in he repre&s;ented the Vertues and Abilities of <HI>Soliman</HI> in an eminent manner, that he was a faithful, experienced, and a fortunate Mini&s;ter, and the only Per&s;on in the World fit and able to be General in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and to conduct an Army in this dangerous and difficult War. The Grand Seignior enter|taining a like &s;en&s;e of the Abilities of <HI>Soli|man,</HI> inclined thereunto, and would have gi|ven him that Employment, had not &s;ome Accidents intervened to prevent it. For the <HI>Embrahor,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, the <HI>Kuzlir</HI> Aga, or Eunuch of the Women, and the Sultana or Empre&s;s her &s;elf, being all Friends and Confidents to <HI>Soliman,</HI> advi&s;ed him of the Plot, which might bring upon him the like Fate, which had befallen <HI>Shai|tan Ibrahim;</HI> and that the be&s;t way to avoid it, would be to pu&s;h at the Office of Vizier, and demand the Seal. <HI>Soliman</HI> encouraged by &s;uch powerful Abettors, boldly ca&s;t him|&s;elf at the feet of the Grand Seignior, and told him, That he was ready to lay down his Life either at Home or in <HI>Hungary</HI> for the Service of him his Ma&s;ter, and &s;acrifice all to his Plea&s;ure and Glory; but to go into <HI>Hungary</HI> without the Seal (which was with|out the power of Vizier) would be of Pre|judice and ill Con&s;equence to the whole Empire, for which he alledged many Rea|&s;ons, and being an eloquent or a well-&s;po|ken Man, was &s;econded by others, who repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent Vizier to be a Per|&s;on infirm and unfit for War. The Grand Seignior was prevailed upon, and agreed to con&s;titute <HI>Soliman</HI> his Vizier;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soliman</HI> made Vi|zier.</NOTE> but the Exe|cution thereof, at the de&s;ire of <HI>Soliman</HI> was deferred until next Morning; and in the mean time, the Matter was carried &s;o &s;e|cretly, that the Vizier had no Intimation or Jealou&s;ie of the Re&s;olution. Next Morn|ing being the time, when the Pay of the <HI>Spahees</HI> was to be delivered out, <HI>Soliman</HI> came to the Vizier's Chamber, and pre&s;&s;ed him very in&s;tantly, that &s;ince he was now in better Health, that he would be pre&s;ent at gi|ving out the Pay unto the <HI>Spahees;</HI> and that in ca&s;e he were wearied or unea&s;y, he would perform the remainder of the Trouble for him; but the Vizier excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and would not come, but de&s;ired <HI>Soliman</HI> to take the trouble upon him of that Day's Office; which as he was performing, and had half done, the Bo&s;tangiba&s;hee to the Grand Seig|nior, or he who is Ma&s;ter of the Wardrobe, came to the Vizier and demanded the Seal, &s;hewing him a Warrant for it, under the Hand of the Grand Seignior: The Vizier was &s;o &s;truck with the Surpri&s;e, that he had &s;carce power and &s;trength to put his trem|bling Hand into his Bo&s;om to give it to him; and Nature being weak in him, he fell in a Swoun, and &s;o was left. So &s;oon as <HI>Soliman</HI> had fini&s;hed the giving out the Pay, a Capigiba&s;hee came to call him to the Grand Seignior, to whom being come, he had the Seal conferred upon him, with the Character of the Supream Vizier, and &s;o was conducted to the publick Palace be|longing to that Office; from whence the former Vizier, without other Ceremony or Warning, was in a moment removed, and being by his Servants put into a Coach,

But when the Officers of the Garri&s;on con&s;ider'd, that the only means to pre&s;erve the place, was to prevent the Draining of the two Ditches of the lower Town, which were extreamly deep, they cut a pa&s;&s;age for &s;everal &s;treams of Water, by &s;ecret and hidden Channels to fall into the Ditch, which being increa&s;ed by the melting of Snow from the Mountains, and continual Flouds of Rain, which fell in that Sea&s;on of the Year, the Ditches were not only filled, but the Earth made &s;o &s;oft and moi&s;t, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to main|tain their Works; &s;o that <HI>Caprara</HI> could do nothing more than Batter the Town with his Cannon, and throw &s;ome Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es with little or no Execution.

<P>But before the great and mo&s;t con&s;ider|able Actions of the following Campaign began, there were certain Preparations or Preludes thereunto repre&s;ented in Fights and Skirmi&s;hes between certain Parties detached from the main Bodies, in all which the Im|periali&s;ts gained the Advantage, and &s;ome|times had the fortune of a clear Victory: On the 14th of <HI>March,</HI> &s;ome Imperial Troops having their Winter-quarters in <HI>Croatia,</HI> routed Fifteen hundred <HI>Turks</HI> drawn up in open Field, and put them to flight; <HI>Achmet</HI> Aga their chief Commander was killed, and his Son taken Pri&s;oner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Achmet Aga <HI>de|feated.</HI></NOTE> This Engagement happen'd near a little Town called <HI>Jalonne,</HI> which the Croats &s;tormed, and took and pillaged it, and &s;et at liberty Eight hundred Chri&s;tian Slaves, of which Three hundred were in a condition to take up Arms.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Di&s;cour&s;e maintain'd and urged by divers, the contrary Opinion prevailed for the Siege of <HI>Buda;</HI> as if the Difficulties thereof &s;erved rather to enflame, than to di&s;courage &s;o many valiant and ge|nerous Spirits:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> re|&s;olved.</NOTE> Such an Enterpri&s;e as the taking a Capital City, with the Conque&s;t of which, the whole Kingdom would fol|low, and fall a Prey into their Hands, &s;eem|ed an Adventure and an Exploit worthy the undertaking of &s;o many brave Soldiers, who were certainly the greate&s;t Captains of this Age, and perhaps we may &s;peak it without injury to pa&s;t times, that they were the be&s;t Soldiers that ever the World had produced. Indeed, the whole Army of this Year was in a mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing Condi|tion, well Provided and Accoutred, Fle&s;hed with Blood and Victory, and &s;o Couragi|ous that nothing &s;eemed too hard and diffi|cult for them.

<PB N="195" REF="108"> to per&s;wade the Military Councils to the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> not knowing whether the next Year would produce &s;uch an Army as at pre&s;ent; which as it was capable to undertake any thing, &s;o it was pity to have it wa&s;ted and employed in trivial matters, and taking in of Fortre&s;&s;es from whence no Important Con&s;equences could be expected. There was moreover one thing more e&s;pecially urged, that by the la&s;t Siege the Defects and Errors, and fal&s;e Attacks were all &s;een and di&s;cover'd, the which might now ea&s;ily be rectified, and provi&s;ions made again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs, which co&s;t the Lives of many Men; and the Ground and nature of it, and Situation being per|fectly known, the &s;ubjection of this place would become much more ea&s;ie than the time before, notwith&s;tanding all the Provi|&s;ions the <HI>Turks</HI> had made.

<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> were urged and &s;ollicited, not only to ha&s;ten their march to the Confines of <HI>Poland,</HI> to keep that Country in Awe; but al&s;o to &s;end another Body to joyn with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Camp in <HI>Hungary.</HI> In the mean time, Skirmi&s;hes daily hapned be|tween &s;everal <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> and Dragoons belong|ing to <HI>Raab</HI> and <HI>Strigonium,</HI> and detached Parties from <HI>Buda;</HI> to which place Rein|forcements were &s;o con&s;tantly &s;ent, that the Garri&s;on was calculated to amount unto above Nine thou&s;and Men, <MILESTONE N="1686"> be&s;ides the Ci|tizens and Inhabitants, tho' in reality the numbers were much greater.

<P>In the mean time the Grand Seignior re|moved from <HI>Adrianople</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignior goes to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> to pa&s;s his Summer there, in hopes that his Pre&s;ence would bring &s;ome Trade to that City; but the War had drained all the Money in &s;uch manner, that the Merchants found little benefit, or alteration in the quick|ne&s;s of their Trade. The Grand Vizier intended at the &s;ame time to have moved from <HI>Adrianople</HI> towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> but the great Fire which had hapned lately there, cau&s;ed him to retard his March for &s;ome Days, in order to rebuild the publick Edifi|ces con&s;umed by the Fire.

<P>The <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> were all this time play|ing a double Game, having &s;ent an Envoy to the Court to complain of the Incur&s;ions, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made into their Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mo&s;co|vites</HI> treat with the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> and of the Depredations which the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Governour of <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> had made upon them at the Mouth of the <HI>Tanais.</HI> The Envoy found a kind Reception, and Orders were &s;ent both to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and Governour of <HI>A&s;ac</HI> to ab&s;tain for the future, from all &s;uch Acts of Ho&s;tility, and maintain a good Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> who were become Allies and faithful Friends to the Port: And more to engage the Envoy, &s;ome few <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Slaves were given him, with Licen&s;e to rebuild an old ruined Greek Church in <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> with which to outward appearance, the Envoy returned with entire Satisfaction.</P>

And the <HI>Turks</HI> having no great value of late for the <HI>Poles,</HI> either as to their Prowe&s;s in War, or Conduct in Peace, gave a proud An&s;wer to the Demand; re|&s;olving this Year to &s;tand on the Defen&s;ive part, and to tire out the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> with a long, and an expen&s;ive War: For th&ocirc; they had lo&s;t &s;ome of their Towns, and been often beaten in the Field; yet they kept up that Pride and fiercene&s;s, which is agree|able to their nature and former &s;ucce&s;&s;es in War.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who had for a long time maintained a Controver&s;y about the <HI>Safraw,</HI> (as formerly mentioned) did now conceive that it might be a very proper Sea|&s;on, after &s;uch various revolutions and change of Officers, by which the Pride of the <HI>Turks</HI> might be aba&s;ed, to obtain tho&s;e Demands which were formerly denied.

The Vizier provoked a little with this new Demand, believing that it pro|ceeded from a meaner Opinion conceived of their Power, by Rea&s;on of their late Mi&s;|fortunes, readily An&s;wered with &s;ome quick|ne&s;s, and &s;aid, That the fir&s;t <HI>Turks,</HI> who came over into <HI>Europe,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Bo&s;pho|rus</HI> but with Forty Men only, and that they would return again by the &s;ame Way with the like number, rather than conde&s;cend to any thing tending to a Diminution, or A|ba&s;ement of the Honour of the Empire. In fine, Th&ocirc; the <HI>French</HI> were treated at this Audience with more than u&s;ual Civility and Re&s;pect; yet could obtain nothing more than a Confirmation of the Privileges they had formerly enjoyed, and a Liberty to re|build a burnt Church.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t Preparations were making on both &s;ides for the War of the &s;ucceeding Year; It was adjudged in the Councils at <HI>Vienna,</HI> to be a matter ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to engage the <HI>Mo&s;covits</HI> in the Confederacy, for that thereby, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> would not only be freed from all Jealou&s;ies, of be|ing Invaded by the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> whil&s;t his Arms were otherwi&s;e diverted; but the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> re&s;trained from their Incur&s;ions, in ca&s;e the Czars would take that Incumbence up|on them, to give a &s;top to their Depredati|ons.

<P>The League being in this manner agreed, &s;igned, and ratified on both &s;ides, the News thereof &s;oon &s;pread it &s;elf over all <HI>Europe,</HI> and was particularly received at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and in the Confederate Camp, with as much Joy and Triumph, as it was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with Trouble and Confu&s;ion. And now it was expected by all the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Treaty was put in exe|cution.</NOTE> that this Agreement &s;hould be executed, and that the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> &s;hould in the fir&s;t place, to give a beginning, have made In|cur&s;ions into the Enemies Country, and without farther delay, have inve&s;ted tho&s;e Places, which lay upon the Frontiers; but in&s;tead thereof, their fir&s;t Exploit was to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dukedom of <HI>Smo|lenzko,</HI> and of <HI>Kiovia,</HI> and of about Fifty Leagues of Country, which lies along by the Banks of the <HI>Nie&s;ter;</HI> but as to other Acts of Ho&s;tility, unle&s;s it were by &s;ome ranging, and confu&s;ed Incur&s;ions made by their own <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> with de&s;ign rather to Pilfer and Pillage, than to Offend and Da|mage the Enemy, nothing of Moment was performed; by which means the <HI>Tar|tars,</HI> again&s;t whom the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> were o|bliged to oppo&s;e their Arms, found an op|portunity to joyn with the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> of <HI>Po|land,</HI> who with united Forces, not only di&s;puted the Pa&s;&s;es with the <HI>Polanders,</HI> but likewi&s;e recruited and reinforced the Grand Vizier's Army in <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>After this Agreement was fini&s;hed, the next Treaty in hand was to deal with <HI>Apafi,</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> to draw him off from his Adherence to the <HI>Turk.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with <HI>Apafi</HI> be|gun.</NOTE> This Prince finding him&s;elf between two great Powers, the lea&s;t of which was able to cru&s;h him to nothing, kept and maintained his Agents at both Courts, only to protract time, and divert a Storm. Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> quartering with a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Foot, on the Confines of that Principality, was appointed by the Emperor to treat with <HI>Apafi,</HI> and to joyn Menaces and Force to fair Words; but little Satisfaction could be extorted from him, more than a De&s;ire to live in a kind of Neutality; for th&ocirc; the Im|perial Forces were not far di&s;tant from him, yet the <HI>Turks</HI> were not as yet beaten out of the Field, nor their Garri&s;ons taken, but all things &s;eemed to remain in a doubtful &s;tate and change of War. Thus <HI>Apafi</HI> fear|ed both, and demanded Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from both &s;ides, hoping that whil&s;t he was wavering and &s;eemed unfixt, he &s;hould pre&s;erve both his Friends, or at lea&s;t not provoke them to be his Enemies. But what Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> could not obtain by Treaty, he forced by two Regiments, which procured the Contributions, which were then exacted; to which <HI>Apafi</HI> more ea&s;ily yielded, becau&s;e &s;uch a Compliance &s;eemed rather an effect of Violence and Nece&s;&s;ity, than of Choice. How&s;oever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> jealous thereof.</NOTE> the <HI>Turks</HI> were not &s;o very well a&s;&s;ured of the Con&s;tancy of the <HI>Tran&s;ilvanias,</HI> but that ju&s;t cau&s;e of Jealou&s;ie remained of their In|clinations towards the Emperor; to prevent which, the <HI>Turks</HI> order'd a &s;trong Body of Men to march and quarter on their Con|fines, there to attend and ob&s;erve the Moti|ons both of the <HI>Germans</HI> and the <HI>Tran&s;ilvani|ans;</HI> the latter of which &s;eeing the Sword over their Heads, continued &s;till in a &s;tate of Irre&s;olution: So that the Emperor e|&s;teeming, that nothing was to be done by Treaty, commanded the Agents to quit his Court: How&s;oever, for a while a &s;top was given to their Departure; for that the Bro|ther of the Prince of <HI>Valachia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Catachuze|no</HI> &s;ent from his Brother Prince of <HI>Valachia</HI> to the Em|peror.</NOTE> called <HI>Cata|chuzeno,</HI> (of which Family and Name were the la&s;t <HI>Greek</HI> Emperors) being privately di|&s;patched to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to enter into a Treaty and League with the Emperor, in the Name and Behalf of his Brother, did in&s;inuate many fine and hopeful Projects, for gain|ing without Blood or Trea&s;ure the three Principalities. In order unto which, a Di|&s;patch was &s;ent to the Count <HI>Scaffemberg,</HI> under the Imperial Signature, immediately to march with his Forces to <HI>Ca&s;&s;ovia,</HI> where he &s;hould find Orders for his farther Pro|ceedings; the Count accordingly obeyed; and immediately upon his arrival, received a po&s;itive Commi&s;&s;ion to joyn Seven thou|&s;and <HI>Germans</HI> to Four thou&s;and <HI>Hungarians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Promi|&s;es.</NOTE> detached from the Troops quartered in the Upper <HI>Hungary;</HI> and with that Army, without any farther delay, to march to the Confines of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> &s;ituate on the River <HI>Maros,</HI> where <HI>Catachuzeno</HI> had given A&s;&s;urances, that Twelve thou&s;and <HI>Tran&s;ilva|nians,</HI> well provided and armed, would there be ready to meet <HI>Scaffemberg,</HI> and joyn with his Forces at their fir&s;t appearance; and with the&s;e, proceeding farther to <HI>Vala|chia,</HI> he &s;hould there on the Confines have his Numbers increa&s;ed by an addition of Sixteen thou&s;and <HI>Valachians</HI> and <HI>Moldavians,</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="110"> with which formidable Force compo&s;ing a mo&s;t powerful Army, it was not to be doubted, but that after the Example of their Soldiers, the three Provinces would revolt, and yield to the Emperor; and with &s;uch a Force, which nothing could oppo&s;e, Incur|&s;ions might be made with Fire and Sword into all Towns and Quarters of the <HI>Turks,</HI> from the River <HI>Danube</HI> to the Confines of <HI>Poland,</HI> and whereby an intercour&s;e of Arms, and other intelligences would be ob|tained.

<P>The rumour and report of the Grand Vi|zier's approach with all his Army did daily increa&s;e, and as a certain Fore-runner there|of, &s;everal Thou&s;ands of his Hor&s;e were advanced very near to di&s;cover the Force and Actions of the <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> Whereupon a Council of War being called of all the Generals, it was concluded to counter|mand the Advance of the Troops, and ap|point them to appear at a general Rendez|vous, where it was plainly manife&s;ted, how greatly the numbers were abated; and there|fore &s;ince the great Line of Circumvallation was perfected and well flanked with &s;trong Redoubts, Spurs and other defen&s;ible Works, they order'd, that the &s;ame &s;hould be main|tained by Three thou&s;and Foot, which were &s;ufficient to give a &s;top to any Attempt, which might be made upon the Camp: And the Imperial, <HI>Bavarian,</HI> and <HI>Branden|burger</HI> Cavalry, were commanded to lodge on the Hills and ri&s;ing Grounds which were round the Town: And the <HI>Heydukes</HI> were encamped along the Wall of the old Town, extending them&s;elves from the Fort &s;ituate on the <HI>Danube,</HI> unto the Trenches of the <HI>Brandenburgers.</HI></P>

Upon this Ad|vice, the Water-&s;ide and Banks of the Ri|ver were well fortified and &s;ecured, and a &s;trong Chain &s;tretched over the Water be|low the Bridge of Boats, from the Shoar to the Point of St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s I&s;le, to ob&s;truct the Pa&s;&s;age of Spies and Me&s;&s;engers, who u&s;ed to &s;wim over the Water with Intelli|gence, and which al&s;o might &s;erve to give a &s;top to the Cavalry, in ca&s;e they &s;hould attempt any thing on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>The City being now in a langui&s;hing Condition, the Grand Vizier re&s;olved to make his la&s;t Effort; and having cho&s;en out of his Army Three thou&s;and of his brave&s;t Soldiers, which he encouraged with Thirty Dollars a-piece paid them in hand, and with promi&s;e of Increa&s;e of their daily Pay, du|ring Life, to &s;uch as &s;hould make and force their Way into the Town; and at the &s;ame time another Body was ordered to enter the Line, at the place which they had lately attempted.

<PB N="216" REF="120"> with great Fury fell in upon the Guards of the Imperiali&s;ts; but were &s;o well received by the Baron of <HI>A&s;ti,</HI> with his <HI>Talpatz</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> and by General <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> with his Regiment, that they were vigorou&s;ly re|pul&s;ed. After which they made an Attempt on Count <HI>Caprara,</HI> and again on the Quar|ters of the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> but in all places were ill treated, and came off with a great lo&s;s of Men. In the mean time, the &s;econd Body of <HI>Turks</HI> a&s;&s;aulted other parts of the Army, which increa&s;ed the heat of the Fight; to &s;uccour which, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> detach'd all the Forces which were about him, remaining alone only with two A&s;&s;i&s;tants; but the Battle growing hot, and the <HI>Turks</HI> endeavouring in diver&s;e places to break into the Line, the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> put him&s;elf at the Head of two Battalions of <HI>Brandenburgers,</HI> who&s;e Example gave Life and Courage to the whole Army. But whil&s;t this Fight was mannaged in diver&s;e Squadrons, which confu&s;edly ran from one &s;ide to another, &s;ome of them had the for|tune to force the Line towards the Wall of the lower City; but pa&s;&s;ing to the Line of Contravallation, they met there &s;uch Vol|lies of Shot, and continual Firings, that knowing not which way to retreat, they fell into the Squadrons of Baron <HI>Marcy</HI> and <HI>Serau,</HI> by whom the greate&s;t part of them were kill'd upon the place; and tho&s;e which e&s;caped were &s;o confu&s;ed, that being di&s;pers'd about the Fields, they knew not which way to take. Some of them happen'd to fall in with the <HI>Brandenburgers,</HI> others into the general Quarters, where being encompa&s;s'd on all &s;ides, they were mi&s;erably cut to pie|ces and &s;lain, not &s;o much as their Servants, or Grooms of their Hor&s;es e&s;caping. The Be&s;ieged in the mean time being Spectators of all that pa&s;&s;ed, de&s;igned by a mo&s;t vigo|rous Sally to meet their Succours, but were &s;o warmly encounter'd by the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> that they were forced to Retreat with pre|cipitation and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The Body which the <HI>Turks</HI> kept for a Re|&s;erve, ob&s;erving the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e Conflicts, dur&s;t not adventure to make another Attack, but retired back to their Camp. The <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t above One thou&s;and Men kill'd on the place, and Twenty five of their Colours were taken. How&s;oever, this Advantage was not obtained without &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;s on the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;ide, which was the more to be lamented by the Death of Baron <HI>Marcy,</HI> who after having kill'd &s;everal <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> with his own hand, receiv'd two Cuts on the Head with a Cy|meter, and one on his Shoulder, which th&ocirc; at fir&s;t were not e&s;teem'd Mortal; yet the Wounds being neglected, and the Cure thereof not much regarded, he Died thereof in a &s;hort time afterwards, to the great Grief of the whole Camp, which much la|mented the lo&s;s of &s;o brave a Soldier.</P>
<P>The Vizier being informed of this unfor|tunate Succe&s;s, immediately gave order to the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> of his Guards, which were kept for a Re&s;erve to renew the Fight, and attempt once more to give &s;uccour to the Town; but the March of the&s;e fre&s;h Forces being di&s;covered by the General Count <HI>Pic|colomini,</HI> who was at the Head of five Regi|ments of Hor&s;e, divided into Twenty five Squadrons, he marched boldly to meet the Enemy; but the <HI>Turks</HI> upon appearance of the Van-guard of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;ounded a Retreat, and returned back to the Vizier's Camp.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e &s;everal Conflicts and Skir|mi&s;hes were acting in the Field, the Attacks upon the Town were not neglected; and on the &s;ide of <HI>Loraine</HI> they had advanced their Lodgment to the Breach of the inward Wall, not above three Pikes length from the Pali&s;adoes; but becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to attack the Town with extream Re&s;o|lution and Force, without which it could not be taken; and that in the mean time, no Interruption &s;hould be given to the A&s;|&s;ault by the outward Force of the Enemy; it was re&s;olved at a Council of War, held by all the Generals then pre&s;ent, that the Lines of Circumvallation &s;hould be made deeper, which being well guarded, would &s;ecure the Soldiers from the Enemy with|out: And in the mean time, to keep the De&s;ign &s;ecret, a Report was given out that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> intended to give Battle to the <HI>Turks;</HI> upon the News of which, the Vizier applied him&s;elf to fortify his Camp, and the Be&s;ieged neglected to provide for their la&s;t Defence.</P>

This put all Hands to work, and in a con|fu&s;ed manner, many Pieces of Cannon were mounted at the Seraglio Point, on the Maiden Tower, which is a little Fort built on a Rock in the Water, in the midway between <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Scutari,</HI> where al&s;o Guns were mounted, and Soldiers and Inhabitants of the City po&s;ted in all places, where might be any &s;u&s;picion or danger of the Enemies de|&s;cent or landing.

<P>The Sea&s;on of the Year much favoured this de&s;ign; for the Rivers, Mar&s;hes, and Fenns were &s;o Frozen up, that the <HI>Turks</HI> found an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age to all parts, which they intended to relieve: Of which the Im|periali&s;ts being very apprehen&s;ive, feared le&s;t the Enemy, who was got together in great Numbers at <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> &s;hould attempt &s;ome of the conquered places, and thereby making a diver&s;ion, &s;hould introduce their Convoys into <HI>Sigeth, Cani&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Alba Re|galis.</HI> But the place, which of any other was &s;traightned mo&s;t for want of Provi&s;ions, was <HI>Agria,</HI> called by the <HI>Hungarians Erla,</HI> &s;ituate on a River of that Name, which about Three Leagues from thence empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Tibi&s;cus.</HI> This place of it &s;elf was but &s;mall, but very well Fortified; It is Recorded in Hi&s;tories that the fir&s;t Siege which the <HI>Turks</HI> laid to it was in the Year 1552. with an Army of Sixty thou|&s;and Men, when it was not &s;trong either by Art or Nature; but the weakne&s;s thereof was &s;upplied by the Courage and Bravery of the Garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting only of Two thou&s;and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Soldiers, and about Sixty <HI>Hungarian</HI> Nobles and Gentlemen, who had fled in thither with their Wives and Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agria.</NOTE> and be&s;t of their Riches and Moveables, and had &s;worn to defend the place to the utmo&s;t extremity; and to let the <HI>Turks</HI> under&s;tand this re&s;olution, they rai&s;ed a Coffin above the Walls in publick View, for an Evidence or Sign, that they would chu&s;e Death rather than Captivity. Many great things are &s;aid of the Defence of this place, which the <HI>Turks</HI> battered for the &s;pace of Forty days ince&s;&s;antly, with Fifty Pieces of Cannon, notwith&s;tanding which the Defendants abated nothing of their Courage; for th&ocirc; the <HI>Turks</HI> a&s;&s;aulted them Three times in one day, yet they were as often repul&s;ed, and lo&s;t about Eight thou&s;and men.

One <HI>Radwanski,</HI> a principal Author of the late Commotions was put to the Torture; and after he had Signed a Confe&s;&s;ion, dyed by the Angui&s;h of the Wrack; how&s;oever the Sentence pronounced again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offenders are pu|ni&s;hed.</NOTE> was ex|ecuted on his Dead Corps, which was to have his Hand and Head cut off, and his Four Quarters di&s;po&s;ed in divers places of the City. In like manner <HI>Pala&s;&s;i, Sekel, Barrock,</HI> and <HI>Concoud,</HI> were Beheaded and Quartered: As al&s;o the &s;ame day one <HI>Be&s;&s;eck,</HI> a Coun&s;ellor of <HI>New&s;ol,</HI> and <HI>Weber,</HI> a pub|lick Notary, <HI>Ta&s;cias,</HI> and &s;everal incurred the &s;ame fate; and &s;o had al&s;o <HI>Feldmeyer,</HI> a Commi&s;&s;ary at War, but that he Killed him|&s;elf in Pri&s;on; how&s;oever that did not hin|der, but that the Sentence was Executed on his Dead Body. To examine this Plot, and &s;ift into the bottom of it, &s;o employed Count <HI>Caraffa,</HI> as for &s;ome time it deferred the de&s;ign of Bombing <HI>Agria;</HI> and indeed &s;o many were the Con&s;pirators, that great Executions were acted in divers places, and many al&s;o received pardon from the Mercy and Clemency of the Emperor; for that his Imperial Maje&s;ty had been well a&s;&s;ured, there were con&s;iderable Numbers of poor inno|cent People engaged in the Plot rather by de|lu&s;ion, and example of others, than by a Natural Spirit and inclination to a Revolt.</P>
<P>Th&ocirc; <HI>Caraffa</HI> was otherwi&s;e employed, yet there wanted not other active Officers in the Field to watch the Motions of the Enemy, and take the Advantages which did pre&s;ent. Baron <HI>Orlick</HI> was commanded to burn the Bridge, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had built over the <HI>Drave</HI> near <HI>E&s;&s;eck;</HI> and accordingly marched away from <HI>Quin&abque; Eccle&s;iae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron <HI>Or|lick</HI> de|feats a Party of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> with Six Companies drawn out from the Regi|ments of <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> and <HI>Herberville;</HI> and being on his march, he received Advice that Eight hundred Jani&s;aries, and Two hundred Spahees &s;elected out of the Flour of the be&s;t <HI>Ottoman</HI> Troops, were detached from <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> with a de&s;ign to intercept a Convoy appointed for the relief of <HI>Ziclos,</HI> and to take and demoli&s;h a &s;mall Redoubt which had &s;ome days before been rai&s;ed on the Banks of that River, by order of Count <HI>Vechi:</HI> Wherefore leaving the de&s;ign of burning the Bridge, Baron <HI>Orlick</HI> marched directly again&s;t the Enemy, whom he found attacking the Fort, in which they had alrea|dy killed a great many men with Grana|does: But &s;o &s;oon as <HI>Orlick</HI> appeared, the <HI>Turks</HI> fell into di&s;order and fear; and being furiou&s;ly charged by him, were defeated with the lo&s;s of above Six hundred men killed on the place, among&s;t which were two Aga's, and a Bey or Lord; Many Pri|&s;oners were taken with all their Baggage, and many En&s;igns and Colours, of which Five were &s;ent to the Emperor by Baron <HI>de Hertleben,</HI> fir&s;t Captain of that Regiment:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> wor&s;ted in &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes.</NOTE> And on the Emperor's &s;ide, Six Sergeants, Five Troopers, and Twelve Dragoons were killed, and many wounded. About the &s;ame time another Party of <HI>Turks</HI> was beaten near <HI>Zolnoch,</HI> Twenty of which were killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chonad</HI> defends it &s;elf again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> and about Thirty taken Pri&s;oners. Moreover Seven thou&s;and <HI>Turks, Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Male-contents</HI> being joyned together, endeavour|ed to &s;urprize <HI>Chonad,</HI> which is a Fortre&s;s &s;ituate on the River <HI>Maros,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> near to <HI>Segedin:</HI> But they met &s;o vigorous a repul&s;e and rude entertain|ment from the Defendants, that they were forced to de&s;i&s;t from their Attacks, and march away with the lo&s;s of Four hundred Soldiers, &s;ome of which were principal Of|ficers.</P>
<P>Thus the News of one ill &s;ucce&s;s com|ing to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> on the Head of another &s;truck the People of all &s;orts and condi|tions with a &s;trange Con&s;ternation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Otto|man</HI> Port in great di&s;order.</NOTE> the Government fearing the ill con&s;equences thereof, endeavoured by all ways and me|thods of gentlene&s;s to appea&s;e the unquiet and fluctuating Spirits of the People and Soldiers. To do this, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of va&s;t Sums of Money, wherewith to quiet and gratify the Army and Fleet, and to &s;a|tisfy the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who declared that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to move without Mo|ney; and which way to rai&s;e it, was the great difficulty; for the Grand Signior's Trea&s;ure was exhau&s;ted, and the People al|ready tired, and over-burdened with Taxes: Wherefore after a long Debate thereupon in the <HI>Divan,</HI> it was agreed, That the Jewels and Plate of the Sultans ama&s;&s;ed in &s;everal Chambers of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> &s;hould be put to &s;ale, which might have rai&s;ed va&s;t Sums of Mo|ney,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great want of Money.</NOTE> could they have been &s;old to their va|lue; but there was an impo&s;&s;ibility of find|ing Buyers; for th&ocirc; the Money could have been found in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> yet there was none, who dur&s;t own to be Ma&s;ter of &s;o &s;o great Riches. In fine, after divers De|bates and Expedients propo&s;ed, it was agreed to rai&s;e Money, by way of Contri|bution,
<PB N="235" REF="129"> on the chief and prime Officers of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and of the Empire, and parti|cularly on <HI>Kadees,</HI> and Men of the Law and Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Means to rai&s;e it.</NOTE> on Cu&s;tomers, Tax-gatherers, and rich Merchants, &s;uch as lived ea&s;ily and idly in their Hou&s;es; it &s;eeming rea&s;onable that &s;uch who enjoyed Protection and Safeguard in their peaceable Acqui&s;itions at home, &s;hould maintain and provide them who were venturing their Lives, and fighting in their defence abroad. And whereas the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> was very pre&s;&s;ing and importunate for Money, without which he could not move or &s;erve in this Year's Campagne; it was re&s;olved to &s;end him Fifty thou&s;and Crowns in Money, and to make up the re&s;t of his Demands in Diamonds, Scymeters &s;tudded with Rubies, Emralds, and Pearls; and with Bucklers &s;et with precious Stones, and other things of value taken from the Trea|&s;ury in the <HI>Seraglio.</HI></P>
<P>But whil&s;t this was contriving, an un|happy Sedition and Mutiny aro&s;e among&s;t the Levents, who are Soldiers belonging to the Sea;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mutiny among the Marine Soldiers.</NOTE> who having wanted Pay for a long time, came in a tumultuous manner to the Captain Pa&s;ha, who is Admiral of the Fleet, to demand it; and ru&s;hed with &s;uch violence into his Hou&s;e, that he had &s;carce time to e&s;cape out of their hands; and had proceeded to greater extremities, had they not been appea&s;ed with a &s;peedy tender of Six Months Pay. When the&s;e things were quieted, a &s;trict Examination was made in|to the Cau&s;e and Leaders of this Mutiny, of which &s;ome were &s;trangled, and about Twenty others were put into a Sack, after their Cu&s;tom, and ca&s;t into the Sea: How|&s;oever this Severity did not &s;o &s;uppre&s;s this Rabble, but that many of them a&s;&s;embled to|gether in the City, where they plundered divers Hou&s;es, and committed a Thou&s;and Outrages, until &s;uch time as Proclamation was made, giving Licence to the People to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice, and kill tho&s;e who made any attempt on their Hou&s;es or Goods; which was the be&s;t way to deal with a Li|centious Tumult; for &s;o &s;oon as &s;uch a De|cree was known, the lewd Mobile grew afraid, and di&s;per&s;ed, mo&s;t of them with|drawing them&s;elves Aboard their Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>But not only did the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Govern|ment labour under a want of Money, but of Men al&s;o.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of men.</NOTE> For whereas they expected a Recruit of Forty thou&s;and men out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> for this Campagne, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t rigorus Commands &s;ent, to compel all men to the War, there appeared not Six thou&s;and: For <HI>Turcomania</HI> had not furni&s;h|ed above Two thou&s;and men; <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> One thou&s;and Eight hundred, and the <HI>A&s;ia</HI> Minor Two thou&s;and: The new Levies in and about <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> did not amount to above Three thou&s;and Five hun|dred; and all that could at pre&s;ent be found, wherewith to Recruit the Armies both in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and in the <HI>Morea,</HI> did not amount unto more than Twenty thou&s;and men; ma|ny of which de&s;erted in their march, and fled into the Mountains, where they ab|&s;conded, and pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t part of the Summer, being forced to commit many Outrages for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The&s;e Misfortunes and di&s;appointments moved the Grand Signior and his Coun|&s;ellors, to judge a Peace with the Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eek for Peace.</NOTE> the mo&s;t compencious Method to &s;ecure the State of the <HI>Ottoman.</HI> Empire, which was now &s;taggering, and falling with its own weight; <MILESTONE N="1687"> and therefore gave orders to the Vizier, then at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> to endeavour a Peace at any price, and rate wha&s;oever. Accordingly the Grand Vizier di&s;patched a Letter from <HI>Belgrade</HI> dated the 6th of <HI>March,</HI> to Prince <HI>Herman</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Council of War to the Emperor, giving him to under&s;tand, That the Sultan, his Lord and Ma&s;ter being per&s;uaded to put an end to this mi&s;erable War, which had long been maintained at the Expence of much Blood, and Trea&s;ure on both &s;ides. He thought it nece&s;&s;ary in order thereunto to Appoint a Place, and Nominate Commi&s;&s;ion|ers for a Treaty: And to Evidence the reality and &s;incere intentions of the Sultan towards a Peace; an Offer was made, as the fir&s;t Preliminary to deliver up <HI>Tekeli</HI> into the hands of the Emperor. The&s;e Propo&s;als were brought by an Aga as far as <HI>Debrezin,</HI> from whence he demanded a &s;afe Conduct to proceed as far as <HI>E&s;peries.</HI> But to cut this Treaty &s;hort, the Emperor commanded Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> to let the Grand Vizier know, that he would be ready to make peace with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, upon a Grant or Con|ce&s;&s;ion of Three Articles only. Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|ror de|mands three Articles.</NOTE> That the Grand Seignior &s;hould pay to him Six Mil|lions of Gold in &s;atisfaction of the Ruin and Spoils, which his Troops had commit|ted in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and other his Hereditary Provinces. 2dly, That all the Towns and Places, which the <HI>Turks</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;hould be delivered up to the Emperor, and the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Forces withdrawn from that Kingdom. 3dly, That in all other matters they &s;hould give equal &s;atisfaction to the Allies.

<P>The Grand Vizier being well a&s;&s;u|red by all the&s;e Proceedings, that there was no further place of hope left for obtaining Peace, commanded the Inhabitants of all places in &s;ubjection to the Grand Seignior, to drive their Cattel under the Reach and Protection of tho&s;e Towns, which were de|fended with Cannon; and to carry their Grain, and Forage, and Moveables into Fortified places, under Obedience of the Grand Seignior.

After which great and &s;ignal Victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> 1687.</NOTE> <HI>Te Deum</HI> was on the 13th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> Sung in the Tent of the Grand Vizier; and Triumphs made by expo&s;ing the Hor&s;e-tails,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Te Deum</HI> Sung in the Vizier's Tent.</NOTE> and great Numbers of Banners and En&s;igns before the Door of the Tent, with Vollies of &s;mall Shot, and Di&s;charge of Four hundred Pieces of Cannon, giving Thanks to God for this &s;o remarkable a Succe&s;s, which was the more ob&s;ervable, becau&s;e this Victory was obtained in that very Ground, where <HI>Lodowick,</HI> the la&s;t of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings was Slain, and his Army Routed by <HI>Sultan Soliman</HI> the Magnificent, who in Memory thereof, cau|&s;ed a Mo&s;ch of Wood to be Erected, and Endowed it with Eight hundred Crowns Yearly Rent, that <HI>Dervi&s;es,</HI> who are a &s;ort of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Friers, might &s;olemnize their daily Devotions and Prayers in that place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army being thus totally Routed, and Di&s;per&s;ed, &s;ome in the Woods, and others in the Mar&s;hes, where many of them dyed of their Wounds, or fainted for want of Food, or Refre&s;hments; others of them, or as many, as could, Travelling a Day and a Night, came at length faint and weary to lodge them&s;elves under the Walls and Cannon of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> without Provi&s;ion to comfort them, or Tents to cover them; where being &s;ad and di&s;con&s;olate, had the Mortification to hear the Triumphs which the Chri&s;tians were making in their Camp for their Victorious Succe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This News affected the Inhabitants of <HI>Agria</HI> to the la&s;t extremity of De&s;pair:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agria <HI>&s;urrenders.</HI></NOTE> They had lived for a long time in hope of Re|lief;
<PB N="246" REF="135"> and feeding on that, and on Hor&s;e-Fle&s;h, and Dogs, and Herbs growing under the Walls, and by making &s;ometimes Ex|cur&s;ions near hand to gain a little &s;u&s;tenance; but now by this la&s;t blow being put beyond all hopes, the People had thoughts privately to abandon the Town, and fly to other Quarters; but the Town being clo&s;ely blocked up by Marque&s;s <HI>Doria,</HI> was forced &s;oon afterwards to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, without any farther Effu&s;ion of Blood.</P>
<P>The Sucee&s;s of this Battle, near <HI>Har&s;cham,</HI> happened very &s;ea&s;onable to the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, and of great Comfort and Joy to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> where they had lately received no very good News in reference to the State of their Army, which, as Report|ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fears at <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE> was very much weakened by late Skir|mi&s;hes, Sickne&s;&s;es, and want of Provi&s;ions, and much hara&s;&s;ed by long Marches, bad Weather, and dirty deep Ways: Of which the Enemy being &s;en&s;ible, was grown bold and daring, and often pre&s;&s;ed them to a Battle: The Emperor being informed hereof, was very doubtful and anxious for the Suc|ce&s;s; and Prayers, Supplications and Penance were ordered to be made in all Churches to implore the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Ble&s;&s;ing; when the Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> arrived at <HI>Vienna</HI> with the News of the Battle, and the Particulars of the Victory, which filled all the Court and City with Joy and Triumph:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joy at the News of Victory.</NOTE> To render which the more compleat and full, Advices were come the Night before from the Senate of <HI>Venice,</HI> to give an Account to his Imperial Maje&s;ty of the Defeat which the Arms of St. <HI>Mark</HI> had given the <HI>Turks</HI> in the <HI>Morea;</HI> which had produced &s;uch a Terror and Con&s;ternation among&s;t them, that in little more than Four and twenty Hours time, Four places had &s;urrendered to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> With the&s;e happy Advices, Expre&s;&s;es being di&s;patched to all Courts of Chri&s;tian Princes, were the Cau&s;e and Subject of common Joy and Jubilee, in the Courts of all, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Kings only excepted.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier with his &s;cattered Troops rallied near <HI>E&s;&s;eck;</HI> where taking an account of the Numbers lo&s;t, he found his Army dimini&s;hed about Twenty thou|&s;and men; for be&s;ides tho&s;e which were kil|led, taken, and drown'd, many had de&s;ert|ed, and withdrawn from the Field. The Face of the whole Camp was &s;ad and di&s;|con&s;olate; and th&ocirc; the Vizier did all he could to comfort and chear them; yet they being not only melancholy, but angry, and a&s;hamed of their di&s;honourable Flight, be|gan to blame and ca&s;t the fault on each other. The <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> with good rea&s;on up|braided the <HI>Spahees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;entions among&s;t the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Militia.</NOTE> as the Authors of their Rout; for that they cowardly retiring, broke in upon their Ranks, and put them into di&s;order; which the Enemy ob&s;erving, pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon them, that they were forced to give way, and with them the whole Army was laid open, and expo&s;ed to the Enemy. The Di&s;pute grew &s;o hot be|tween the Two Ranks, and Orders of Sol|diers, who were always emulous of each other, that at length they came to Blows, and to a Civil War, in which about Seven hundred were killed upon the place.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier, and Officers had no &s;ooner with much pain and labour parted the Fray, but the tumultuous Soldiery joyn|ed together to accu&s;e the Vizier him&s;elf, and to cry out, that the lo&s;s of the day was to be charged on him, and the Myrmidons about him, who were the mo&s;t forward to &s;how an Example to the Soldiery of a ba&s;e and fearful Flight; the which Clamour cau|&s;ed &s;uch a Mutiny in the Camp, as had put the Life of the Vizier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appea&s;ed with Mony.</NOTE> and many great Offi|cers into extreme danger, had not the Vi|zier with Money and fair words mollified their Anger. But this accommodation con|tinued not long, before the Grand Vizier was forced to give way to the irre&s;i&s;tible fury and &s;edition of the Soldiery, as we &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to declare.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> not to lo&s;e the benefit and advantage of &s;o glorious a Victory, de&s;igned a farther Con|que&s;t, and to conclude the Campaigne, with &s;ome other memorable Enterprize. It was the common Talk at <HI>Vienna</HI> among&s;t the Courtiers, at the Emperor's Palaces, and among&s;t the Religious men in their Con|vents and Mona&s;teries; that the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> was to pro&s;ecute his Victory without delay as far as <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and thence to pa&s;s to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and make that City his Head Quarters for this Winter; but the&s;e men, who had repo&s;ed them&s;elves quietly at home, had not the Thoughts, nor Con&s;i|deration of the great Generals, to know the Sufferings and Hard&s;hip which the Cavalry had &s;u&s;tained this Summer in pa&s;&s;ing Boggs and Mar&s;hes, by want of Forage, and long Marches; nor the difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing the River of <HI>Drave,</HI> defended by the &s;trong For|tre&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> nor the Sea&s;on of the Year too far &s;pent to undertake any great Enter|prize: All which being con&s;idered by the Two Great Captains, the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forces &s;ent under <HI>Dunewalt.</HI></NOTE> they re&s;olved only to &s;end a detachment of Ten thou&s;and men, under Command of General <HI>Dunewalt,</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Drave</HI> at <HI>Turanovitz,</HI> and there to undertake &s;uch de&s;igns, as &s;hould be thought mo&s;t facile and fea&s;ible, without over-much hazard to be put in Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Dunewalt</HI> accordingly began his March on the 17th towards <HI>Siklos,</HI> where he was fur|ni&s;hed with 18 Pieces of heavy Cannon, and
<PB N="247" REF="135"> Four Mortars taken lately from the Enemy, of which he was to make u&s;e in ca&s;e of a Siege, or other occa&s;ion; and was there re|inforced with a con&s;iderable Body of Croats, under Command of their <HI>Bano.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> in the mean time took his march with the remainder of his Army towards <HI>Mohatz,</HI> with de&s;ign to pa&s;s the <HI>Danube,</HI> and on that &s;ide to refre&s;h his Army, and allot out to them Quarters for the Winter in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania, Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Valachia,</HI> obli|ging tho&s;e Ho&s;podars, or Princes to yield Obedience to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, and pay Contributions, by which means not on|ly the Hereditary Countries of the Emperor, but the wa&s;ted and con&s;umed Provinces of <HI>Hungary</HI> would be ea&s;ed, and relieved of their long burdens and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> pa&s;&s;es the <HI>Danube.</HI></NOTE> Some Leagues above <HI>Mohatz,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube</HI> with all his Baggage, and Train of Artillery, at a place, where he had the advantage of an I&s;land in the mid&s;t of the River, to lay more ea&s;ily their Bridges. The Army having pa&s;&s;ed the Wa|ter with all their Artillery and Baggage, it was expected by &s;ome, and &s;o made the common Di&s;cour&s;e, that a farther Enter|prize would be undertaken, and that the Army would march towards <HI>Peter-Waradin,</HI> and thence proceed to the Siege of <HI>E&s;&s;eck;</HI> but this de&s;ign after mature con&s;ultation, appeared too difficult in this pre&s;ent Sea&s;on: For that great Floods of Rain had fallen, and &s;o filled the Rivers that the Waters could not be contained within their Channel, but overflowed all the Fields and Meadows bor|dering on the River; and afterwards when the Water abated, they had yet covered the Grounds with &s;o much Mire and Sand, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to march near to the Brink of the River, &s;o as to have the benefit or u&s;e of their Boats for Carriage of their Fo|rage and Provi&s;ions: Wherefore it was re&s;ol|ved to Lade the Provi&s;ions and Baggage on Carts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provi&s;ions laden on Carts.</NOTE> and take their march with the whole Army towards <HI>Segedin:</HI> The Boats being emptied and di&s;charged, were all burnt, as needle&s;s and cumber&s;ome; and the greater Barges on which the Cannon and Ammuni|tion were laden, were drawn up the River by Hor&s;es and Oxen, attended with a Con|voy of three Regiments of Hor&s;e and Dra|goons: And in this manner <HI>Loraine</HI> took his March towards the <HI>Tibi&s;cus;</HI> but the E|lector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> judging that the Campaign was &s;o far &s;pent, that no great Enterprize was more to be atchieved, having commit|ted his Troops to the care and conduct of the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> he together with Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> took his way towards the City of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>But this March proved much more diffi|cult than was imagined or expected; for the Ways and Fields by the continual Rains were &s;o deep and rotten, and full of Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffi|culty of marching.</NOTE> that the Army in&s;tead of being relieved, and ea&s;ed of their late Fatigues and Suffer|ing, &s;eemed to be engaged and engolfed in greater; for their March was in Mire and Dirt to the Mid-leg, the Weather very Raw and Cold, without Wood or other Fuel to dry and warm them at the end of their day's March; and without any other Su|&s;tenance, than dry Bisket &s;oftned with bad Water, &s;uch as was found in the Ditches and the Ways; &s;o that it was not &s;trange that the Army &s;hould grow Sickly, and weakned with &s;o many and &s;o long &s;uffer|ings. Some Troops of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had fled to <HI>Peter Waradin</HI> having notice hereof, order'd a Detachment of &s;ome Forces be|longing to <HI>Tekeli,</HI> joyned to a &s;trong party of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sickly and infirm at|tacked by the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> to fall in upon the Rear of the Imperiali&s;ts, which often-times hapned to the great lo&s;s and hurt of the &s;ickly and infirm, who were mi&s;erably cut to pieces, and &s;lain by the Enemy. Nor was the Cavalry in a much better Conditi|on, for travelling over Mar&s;hes and Wet-grounds, their Hor&s;es died for want of Forage.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> with his principal Commanders con&s;idering hereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Foot carried in Carts.</NOTE> order'd that all Officers having Carts &s;hould ap|ply them to the u&s;e of the &s;ickly and weak Infantry; and to give a good Example here|in to others, he was the fir&s;t to proffer his own Waggons, which all other Officers ob|&s;erving, generou&s;ly afforded their Carriages to the u&s;e of the Foot, by which the Army was wonderfully relieved, and after many hard&s;hips were brought near to the Quarters of <HI>Segedin,</HI> where the Air and Waters being more whol&s;ome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sick recover at <HI>Segedin.</HI></NOTE> and the Forage and Provi|&s;ions more plentiful, the Sick began to re|cover, and after &s;ome few days of re&s;t and refre&s;hment, the whole Army was in a great mea&s;ure re&s;tcr'd to perfect Health and &s;trong Condition: After which they marched to <HI>Zolnock,</HI> where they found plenty of all Provi&s;ions and Forage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Zol|nock.</NOTE> provided and ga|thered by the abundant care, and indu|&s;try of Count <HI>Caraffa</HI> chief Governour of the upper <HI>Hungary:</HI> And thence they march|ed to <HI>Debrezin,</HI> from whence the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> detached the Regiment of <HI>Cuira&s;&s;i|ers</HI> commanded by Count <HI>Palfi,</HI> with the Regiment of Foot belonging to Count <HI>Sta|remberg,</HI> with Orders to march unto <HI>Po&s;&s;o|nium</HI> or <HI>Presburg,</HI> there to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Co|ronation of the Arch-Duke <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Son of the Emperor, then created King of the <HI>Ro|mans.</HI></P>
<P>But to return now to the Turki&s;h Camp, where we may believe, that after &s;o fatal a Rout there was great Confu&s;ion: The
<PB N="248" REF="136"> Grand Vizier retired from <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI> to <HI>Peter Waradin,</HI> where he intended to mu&s;ter up his Forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedition in the Tu ki&s;h Camp.</NOTE> and to recount his lo&s;s, and make the be&s;t &s;tand he could again&s;t the far|the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Arms; but the Turki&s;h Troops in&s;tead of yielding obe|dience to their Commanders, publickly aro&s;e again&s;t the Vizier, boldly demanding of him five Months pay, and the &s;urrender of <HI>Mahomet's</HI> Colours or Standard: Upon which In&s;olence the Grand Vizier fled to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> &s;ending before him Fourteen Mules laden with Money; at which the Militia being more enraged, propo&s;ed to Elect <HI>O&s;|man Pa&s;ha, Ogli</HI> or <HI>Sciaus Pa&s;ha</HI> for their Leader: For with both the&s;e the Vizier had a Quarrel before the Battle, and after it up|on his Complaints made again&s;t them to the Grand Seignior, for not having done their Duty in the Fight, had obtained a <HI>Ha&s;te &s;he|riff,</HI> or a Royal command to Strangle or Bani&s;h them, as he judged mo&s;t for Service of the Sultan; but <HI>Soliman</HI> the Vizier be|ing aver&s;e to Blood, laid the Command by him, without Execution of it, which com|ing to the knowledge of the&s;e two turbu|lent Men, they rai&s;ed the Militia again&s;t him; who offered to acknowledge <HI>O&s;man Pa&s;ha</HI> for their General, provided he would undertake to kill the Vizier; which Enter|prize he readily accepted, and enter'd the Vizier's Tents, where he killed &s;everal of his Servants and Pages; as he did al&s;o the Vizier's <HI>Kahya</HI> or Deputy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sciaus</HI> Pa&s;ha made Ge|neral.</NOTE> who &s;ent to ap|pea&s;e the Mutiny; but the Vizier him&s;elf e&s;caped in a Boat down the <HI>Danube,</HI> accom|panied with the <HI>Tefterdar</HI> or Lord Trea|&s;urer, and <HI>Reis Effendi</HI> or Secretary of State, upon notice of which the Soldiery elected <HI>Sciaus Pa&s;ha</HI> for their General, laying <HI>O&s;man Pa&s;ha</HI> a&s;ide, notwith&s;tanding his late Ser|vice, having been a Rebel and Robber in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Sedition being begun, a great Revolution followed in the Empire; which was not &s;o much cau&s;ed by the defeat of the Turki&s;h Army, as by the natural Tem|per of the Vizier, and the Poverty of the Trea&s;ury which could not furni&s;h Money &s;ufficient for payment of the Soldiery. For th&ocirc; <HI>Solyman</HI> was a Man of dexterity in Negotiations, and well qualified for a Court;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Chara|cter of the Vizier.</NOTE> yet being of a mild Nature was not &s;o proper to command a Camp, wanting that Vigour, and Martial Spirit which &s;hould make him &s;evere, &s;o as to be fear'd and re&s;pected: Be&s;ides, having little expe|rience in War, and of an open and free Humour, lent his Ear to every Advi&s;er, &s;o that among&s;t diver&s;ity of Opinions he became confu&s;ed and unre&s;olved, and in&s;tead of go|verning was governed, and &s;ometimes made to act again&s;t his own Judgment. Tis true, the Vizier had by his care and indu&s;try ga|thered a powerful Army and good Troops for this Campaign; for he had &s;ummoned all the <HI>Otoracks,</HI> or Soldiers who had for|merly been freed and exempted from the War, and had long lived at ea&s;e, and with convenience at their own Hou&s;es, to return again to the Camp, and to the &s;everities of Martial Di&s;cipline; many of which had been Spectators or Actors in the Munities, during the Minority of Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and wanting now pay, and their accu&s;tom|ed ea&s;e, were &s;oon incited to Sedition on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, which now hapned up|on the&s;e Misfortunes, and the Flight of the Vizier.</P>
<P>The Sedition being thus begun, we will leave the Mutiniers for a while and return to the Exploits of General <HI>Dunewalt,</HI> and then relate at large the great Revolution which after this en&s;ued at the Port. <HI>Dune|walt</HI> had continued his March for &s;everal days from <HI>Siklos,</HI> and at length without any con&s;iderable Encounter, he came to <HI>Turno|vitz,</HI> where he laid a Bridge and pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Drave;</HI> and being there relieved with Pro|vi&s;ions, he proceeded to the attack of <HI>Wuch|ing,</HI> a Ca&s;tle well fortified, and the Garri|&s;on lately reinforced with a Thou&s;and <HI>Tar|tars:</HI> And th&ocirc; the Ways were deep and bad, and the Weather rainy and wet, yet no|thing was impo&s;&s;ible for a victorious Ar|my, which marched along the &s;ide of &s;ome Hills, where the Ways were more hard and dry. Count <HI>Lodron</HI> with his Regiment, and Count <HI>Budiani</HI> with &s;ome hundreds of <HI>Hu&s;|&s;ars,</HI> and a Sargent Major with Two hun|dred Dragoons, were commanded to ad|vance before to Inve&s;t <HI>Wuchin,</HI> and to hin|der all Succours which might be &s;ent for its Relief, until the Mortars and Cannon, and the re&s;t of the Army could come up. At length the Bombs, and Train of Artillery being with much labour and difficulty arrived; Batteries were rai&s;ed, and the place &s;um|moned to Surrender; to which at fir&s;t a haughty and an ob&s;tinate An&s;wer was re|turned, but the Cannon being mounted and fired, in the &s;pace of one day had made &s;uch a Breach, that the <HI>Turks</HI> con&s;idering the Re&s;olution of the Chri&s;tians, and the impo&s;ibility of being relieved, di&s;plaid a white Flag, and de&s;ired to Capitulate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wuchin <HI>taken by</HI> Dunewalt:</NOTE> At fir&s;t they demanded liberty to March out like Soldiers with Arms and Baggage, but that being denied them, with all other Con|ditions, excepting only to yield at Di&s;creti|on, they were forced to &s;ubmit to the Will of the Conquerour, and lo&s;e their Freedom and E&s;tates, to &s;ave their Lives.

<P>The Sea&s;on of the Year being advanced towards Winter; it might well be judged a convenient time to draw the Soldiers into Quarters, and give the Troops re&s;t and re|po&s;e after the many Fatigues and Hard&s;hips &s;u&s;tained; but God &s;till favouring the De|&s;igns of the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were in all places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with fear and con&s;ternation; it was thought fit by the Commanders to follow the Foot-&s;teps of Fortune, and not to give over the Game with a lucky Hand; wherefore Count <HI>Appre|mont</HI> being left in the Government of <HI>E&s;|&s;eck,</HI> with a Garri&s;on of Eighteen Compa|nies of Foot, and Sixteen Troops of Hor&s;e, the General re&s;olved to attack <HI>Po&s;&s;ega,</HI> the Metropolis of all <HI>Sclavonia;</HI> and in his March thither he &s;ummoned the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Orovitza,</HI> Situate on a high Hill, an the Foot of which is a Palancha, or &s;mall Re|doubt; the Ground is covered with Che&s;nut-Trees, and planted with Fruit Trees; the Garri&s;on at fir&s;t returned an angry and re&s;o|lute An&s;wer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Turks <HI>quit</HI> Oro|vitza.</NOTE> but afterwards thinking better with them&s;elves, they packed up the be&s;t of their Goods and Baggage, and in the night by &s;ecret and By-ways through the Woods and Mountains privately &s;tole away, every one &s;hifting for him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner he was able: So that in the morning the Chri&s;tians enter'd the Town and Ca&s;tle without any oppo&s;ition; being a place very

The Wife of <HI>Solyman</HI> amid&s;t her Fears, &s;ent two Trunks filled with Sables, and rich Habits, and Ve&s;t|ments to the Hou&s;e of a certain Friend to be there &s;ecured, and were accordingly co|vered under a Pile of Wood: This matter being ob&s;erved by a crew of Rogues, they came that Night, pretending an Order from the <HI>Chimacam</HI> to &s;eize tho&s;e Goods, naming the place where they were concealed; at which the People of the Hou&s;e being affright|ed, immediately delivered the Trunks to the Hands of the Rogues: The next day the Wife of <HI>Solyman,</HI> full of &s;orrow and an|gui&s;h of Mind, came to the <HI>Chimacam</HI> to make complaint of this hard U&s;age, decla|ring the Goods to be her own, and not her Husband's.

<P>The next day <HI>Solyman</HI>'s Head was &s;ent for a Pre&s;ent to the Army, by two Officers belonging to the New Vizier, with a Letter from the <HI>Chimacam,</HI> accompanying an Im|perial Command or Signature from the Sul|tan, declaring, that if the Army would &s;tay and Winter at <HI>Adrianople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Propo&s;als &s;ent to the Army;</NOTE> he would give them full &s;atisfaction in &s;ending the Heads of all they &s;hould demand, not &s;paring his own Sons or Brother, and would &s;end them the Fifteen Months Pay that they were in Ar|rear, with the &s;ame Donative as &s;hould have been given, in ca&s;e a new Grand Seignior had been created.

<P>And now the Fate of the Grand Seignior &s;eemed to approach; for the Army drew near, and had rejected all the fair Terms, and Propo&s;itions which the Sultan had offered them, and yet he &s;till continued to make &s;uch Sacrifices to them as he thought might &s;weeten and appea&s;e them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army inflexible.</NOTE> But <HI>Turks</HI> were never u&s;ed to be overcome by gentle Terms and &s;oft Promi&s;es, but by the <HI>Topuz</HI> or Club, or by violent Remedies.

The &s;ame Day <HI>Cochiuck</HI> or little <HI>Mahomet,</HI> a Pe&s;tilent Fellow, and chief Head of the Mutinous <HI>Spahees,</HI> with &s;even other Ringleaders in all the Seditions, was lodged in the great Palace of the <HI>Hypo|dromo;</HI> and when he went abroad was al|ways attended with a numerous armed Guard, whether out of State, or Fear, is not well known; having a confidence in him|&s;elf, and his Merits and good Services he had done for the Soldiery, adventured to per&s;wade them to a quiet, and an orderly be|haviour, and to content them&s;elves for the pre&s;ent with three Pays, and to have a lit|tle patience for the re&s;t, and for their Do|native, until Money could be rai&s;ed: This admonition &s;ounding not well in the Ears of &s;ome Soldiers, they pre&s;ently in&s;tilled into the Minds of their Comrades, that this <HI>Mahomet</HI> had been taken off with Mony, and was brought into the A&s;&s;ociation with tho&s;e, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to defraud them of their ju&s;t Demands: Such a &s;ini&s;ter Re|port as this, was enough at that time to have de&s;troyed half their Officers; as it quickly did his bu&s;ine&s;s; for immediately they ran to his Palace to look for him there, but mi&s;&s;ing him, they afterwards met him in the Streets, and pulled him from his Hor&s;e, &s;aying, You that brought us hither, and &s;hould Speak for us, now look to your &s;elf; you Lie in a Palace, Eat High, and are clad in Sables, whil&s;t we poor Fellows are Ragged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief of the Mu|tineers kil|led.</NOTE> and Lie in the Yards of the <HI>Mo&s;chs,</HI> and Corners of the Streets; and with that they ru&s;hed upon him, and with Clubs and Knives killed him, and Toar his Body in Pieces.

<P>All the care was now to pacifie the Sol|diers, which was only to be done with Money; and the Art was, how to &s;eparate and divide the <HI>Spahees;</HI> as a means where|unto they began to give pay to the <HI>Jani&s;a|ries,</HI> and to &s;erve them fir&s;t: This had like|ly to have begotten ill Blood; but the <HI>Spahees</HI> put them in mind of the &s;olemn Oath, they had made to &s;tand by each other; and the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> refu&s;ed their Pay, without the increa&s;e both of their Pay and Donative;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spa|hees</HI> and <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> unite.</NOTE> but there being not as yet a &s;ufficient Fund for all, the Tumults &s;till continued.

This Friend&s;hip being made between the&s;e two Military Orders; the <HI>Spahees</HI> as the more polite and ingenious Men took all the Government into their own Hands, holding their Councils at <HI>Atmeidan,</HI> and what was there re&s;olved, was reported to the Vizier by four of their own Mem|bers, and the Vizier being forced to a&s;&s;ent unto all their Demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier yields to all their demands.</NOTE> gave them a Wri|ting to approve of all that they &s;hould do, and liberty to u&s;e &s;uch Methods for rai&s;ing Money, as they &s;hould judge mo&s;t conve|nient in this exigence, both to &s;atisfie the Donative, and the Arrears and Increa&s;e of Pay.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Conde&s;centi|ons, and th&ocirc; the means were put into their Hands to pay them&s;elves what they demand|ed, yet the Troubles and Embroils &s;till conti|nued: For the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> &s;u&s;pecting that their Aga or Commander in Chief was not cordial to them, nor approving their Actions (for every one was thought &s;o, who did not run to the &s;ame heigth of Madne&s;s with them) they turned him out of his Office, and would have none of their own Body to command them, but one, as in former times, taken out of the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and &s;uch an one they pitch|ed upon, called <HI>Mu&s;tapha Aga,</HI> a Chirur|gion by profe&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jani|&s;aries</HI> chu&s;e a new <HI>Aga.</HI></NOTE> who had been Twenty five years in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> of which he had been eight <HI>Tulbentgee</HI> or Turbant-folder to

<P>The Tumults &s;till continued, and mu&s;t &s;o until Money could be found, which the Soldiers were now them&s;elves to rai&s;e; every Man that had Money mu&s;t now bleed his Coffers, and redeem his Life with his Riches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of rai|&s;ing Money.</NOTE> The Favourits of the <HI>Se|raglio</HI> mu&s;t pay their Shares, being taxed at va&s;t Sums, the particulars of which were not exactly known; but it was reported, That the <HI>Selictar Aga</HI> to the late Grand Seig|nior, now made Pa&s;ha of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> paid Six hundred Pur&s;es; the <HI>Chiohadar,</HI> or he who is Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Wardrobe,</HI> Two hun|dred; the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bal&s;ora,</HI> Two hundred; be&s;ides many others, who all paid their A&s;&s;e&s;ments, as the Soldiers were plea&s;ed to Rate and Tax them.</P>
<P>Then the Chief of the <HI>Spahees</HI> called be|fore them &s;everal of the Rich men of the City, and Taxed them each according to what they believed them worth; and &s;ent an Officer, with a certain Number of Soldiers, to go with them to their re&s;pective Hou&s;es, and &s;tay with them until the Money was paid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich Men taxed.</NOTE> and then they carried it to the Trea|&s;urer, taking his Receipt for the &s;ame.

But in the mean time we may re|flect, that the change of the per&s;on of the Prince, could not be of much advantage to the Publick: For what the other did out of a remi&s;s and voluptuous Humour, attending only to his Diverti&s;ements, and leaving the Care and Management of all his Affairs to the Contrivance and Conduct of his Mini|&s;ters; this Grand Seignior mu&s;t now do out of nece&s;&s;ity, being wholly unexperien|ced in the World, having all his Life been kept up in a Chamber, without other Con|ver&s;ation, than that of a few Eunuchs, &s;ome old Women, and two or three <HI>Hogiaes,</HI> or Ma&s;ters to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Studies.

<P>Thus were all things turned up-&s;ide down; all the great Officers of the Empire, except the Captain Pa&s;ha or Admiral, being changed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the changes.</NOTE> Which when a Man &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;iders, and that the&s;e Revolutions were car|ried on by common Soldiers, one would ad|mire that they &s;hould pa&s;s with &s;o little Confu&s;ion, or Blood-&s;hed: For except tho&s;e &s;ix which were killed in the Army, and <HI>Cuchiuck Mahomet</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in a Mi|litary Fury, there was only <HI>Solyman</HI> and <HI>Re|geb</HI> cut off; for the Death of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> did not proceed from them, but from <HI>Regeb.</HI> As to the daily In&s;olences in the Streets, they were not committed by the <HI>Spahees,</HI> but by poor Drunken <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who had neither Money nor Cloths, and therewith would be &s;upplied from <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> too. But this was no new thing, but what had been formerly practi&s;ed by the ba&s;er &s;ort of the Soldiers, as often as they came from the War, or were &s;hortly going thither. And now &s;ince things were thus changed, &s;ome Reforma|tion was expected, and that was to begin in the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> where the fir&s;t and mo&s;t plau|&s;ible thing was the Retrenchment of the Ex|pences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reforma|tions in the Govern|ment.</NOTE> which during the time of the late <HI>Sultan</HI> had been exce&s;&s;ive, the very Barly for the Hor&s;es co&s;ting One thou&s;and five hundred Dollars, or Three hundred pounds Sterling a Day; the number of the Hawks and Dogs, with the People who attended them was va&s;t, all which were ordered to be reduced; for the pre&s;ent <HI>Sultan</HI> took &s;o little delight in the&s;e Diverti&s;ements, that he was to learn how to Ride; and the Sta|bles were to be reduced to a Hundred Hor&s;e, one Hundred and fifty of the Pages were to be made <HI>Spahees,</HI> and the re&s;t were to be changed, and new ones put into their places. The &s;ame was to be performed in the Courts and Chambers of the Women; &s;o that the Retrenchments made were cal|culated to amount unto Eight thou&s;and Pur|&s;es of Money a year, every Pur&s;e being Five hundred Dollars, and may be account|ed to be almo&s;t a Million of pounds Ster|ling: The Greyhounds and Dogs, of which there were many Hundreds kept in the <HI>Se|raglio</HI> for the u&s;e of the late <HI>Sultan,</HI> were all let loo&s;e and &s;uffered to run about the Streets of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where they might have &s;tarved, had not the godly Men, who&s;e Religion con&s;i&s;ts much in feeding Dogs and Cats, taken Compa&s;&s;ion on them, and fed them daily with Bread from the Ba|kers Shops.</P>
<P>The&s;e Retrenchments of expence in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> plea&s;ed the Soldiers wonderfully,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Decem.</HI> 1687.</NOTE> hoping that thereby the more Money would be coming to them; and &s;o they continued very ob&s;ervant and quiet, during all the time that the Money was paying out; but &s;o &s;oon as that began to fail and fall &s;hort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Com|motions.</NOTE> they became as trouble&s;ome as ever, a&s;&s;em|bling with great In&s;olence at the Vizier's Hou&s;e, threw Stones at his Windows, &s;torm|ing and raging like Mad-men, until &s;uch time as with fair words, and promi&s;es of Money within a few Days they were for a while appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus far had the Soldiery found the ways to rai&s;e Money; but now they being at a &s;tand, it was the Vizier's turn to &s;et on foot &s;ome new invention, or conjuration for more: But &s;o empty and drained were all the great Banks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Money wan+ting, but it found.</NOTE> that no other way could be thought on, but only to go over the rich Men once more, and to &s;queeze them to the la&s;t Dreggs of all their E&s;tates; to perform which they began with the old <HI>Kuzlir Aga,</HI> who obtained his Liberty upon payment of Nine hundred Pur&s;es, in all, be|&s;ides his Furniture, and Curio&s;ities which were taken from him to a great value; and after that he had the favour to be Bani&s;ht to Grand <HI>Cairo:</HI> The <HI>Ha&s;nadar Aga,</HI> who (as we have &s;aid) &s;ucceeded him, was di&s;placed, and paid Two hundred Pur&s;es; and the <HI>Aga</HI> of the old <HI>Seraglio</HI> was made <HI>Kuzlir Aga;</HI> which Promotion was according to the anci|ent Methods, that every one &s;hould ri&s;e and &s;ucceed gradually, and &s;avoured &s;ome|thing of a Reformation. But becau&s;e this new Tax would not reach the entire Sum required for the Soldiers Pay and Donative; they were forced to Coin out of Plate, and Silver and Gold taken off from the Hor&s;es Furniture belonging to the <HI>Seraglio</HI> Two hundred Pur&s;es in Gold, and Sixty in Sil|ver; with which every one being &s;atisfied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spa|hees</HI> re|turn home.</NOTE> all was quiet and calm again, and the <HI>Spa|hees</HI> returned to their own Homes; leaving &s;ix of the Chief Mutiniers to remain behind at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> That is to &s;ay, one Chief,

And having remained &s;ome few days at this place, he took his leave of the Emperor, and his Journey to <HI>In&s;prug,</HI> being all the way honoured with the Prai|&s;es, Acclamations, and Ble&s;&s;ings of the People.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Agria</HI> being mi&s;erably &s;traitned for want of Victuals, many died, and others to avoid Famine, abandoned the Town, and fled privately to other places: Tho&s;e which remained within, grew de&s;perate of all relief: For <HI>Tekely</HI> had promi&s;ed them Succours, and in pur&s;uance thereof in|tended to pa&s;s the <HI>Tibi&s;cus;</HI> but meeting there with &s;ome Forces under Count <HI>Sarau,</HI> was forced to retire, leaving <HI>Agria</HI> to its own Fate: Of which the People having In|formation, they all aro&s;e, and with one con&s;ent laying before the Pa&s;ha their mi&s;e|ries, in which they mu&s;t (if not prevented) in a &s;hort time inevitably peri&s;h, they con|&s;trained him to propo&s;e a Treaty, and &s;end Two Ho&s;tages to the Imperial Camp; which being accordingly done, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Doria</HI> accepted them, and in exchange there|of &s;ent Two others to the City. The Arti|cles were ea&s;ily agreed, but not &s;o &s;oon exe|cuted; for the Pa&s;ha out of an unnece&s;&s;ary caution, required that the Capitulations &s;hould be confirmed by the Hand of the Em|peror; in compliance with which demand, Marque&s;s <HI>Doria</HI> di&s;patched Count <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Lamberg,</HI> a <HI>Carinthian</HI> Gentleman, with an Aga, to make tender of the Articles to the Emperor; the which having been exa|mined, were Approved, Confirmed, and Signed by his Imperial Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Articles being returned with their Confirmation, and the Writings of Treaty exchanged, Count <HI>Mar&s;igli</HI> with a Com|mi&s;&s;ary of the Artillery, was &s;ent into the Town, that with his u&s;ual Zeal, and dex|terous Management of Affairs, which he had evidenced in &s;everal occa&s;ions in the Emperor's Service, he might take notice of the &s;tate of the place, and the Provi&s;ions belonging to it. The Count being entred into the Gates, was received kindly by the People, and with much faithfulne&s;s was &s;hewed all the Magazines, Stores, and Am|munition of the place. We mu&s;t not expect to receive any account of Victuals, for tho&s;e were long &s;ince con&s;umed; but as to Ammunition, there were Twenty thou&s;and Cannon-Bullets remaining, of which Four Thou&s;and were for Whole Cannon; One Thou&s;and hundred Weight of Powder, Twenty thou&s;and Hand-Granadoes, be&s;ides great quantities of Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es, many thou&s;ands of Match, One hundred and Ten Pieces of Cannon, five Mortar Pieces,

<P>All the Garri&s;on, with Men, Women and Children, which marched out, were Three thou&s;and five hundred; about Six hundred remained in the place and &s;ubmitted to the Imperial Sovereignty. It was &s;ad to hear the Mi&s;eries of tho&s;e People recounted, who had for &s;everal Months lived on nothing but boyled Herbs; and if a piece of Hor&s;e-fle&s;h could have been purcha&s;ed with Gold, to dre&s;s and put in the Pot with them, it would have been a Fea&s;t for &s;everal Days. The con&s;tancy of this People in their &s;uffer|ings cannot be &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed; &s;o that as the Blocade it &s;elf was the mo&s;t fa|mous of any in our Age, &s;o the Surrender of the place was of high importance; for Thirteen Counties depended thereon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The advan|tage of ta|king <HI>A|gria.</HI></NOTE> and the Emperor thereby became ab&s;olute Ma|&s;ter of all that Country, which lies between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Tibi&s;cus;</HI> and laid <HI>Mon|gatz</HI> open and expo&s;ed to greater danger, which was already blocked up by Forces quarter'd round the place. Thus having fi|ni&s;hed the relation of this year's Wars in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> it will be pertinent to our Hi&s;tory to pa&s;s over into the <HI>Morea,</HI> and there take a Survey of that Country, and recount the Exploits and Atchievements, performed there this year by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Arms.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="1687"> At the beginning of this Year, the Senate ordained three days of &s;olemn Devotion to implore the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on the Arms of that Republick, which was performed with many Proce&s;&s;ions, expence of Lamps and Wax;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayers at <HI>Venice</HI> for Succe&s;s.</NOTE> and with many Vows and Prayers of the People. So &s;oon as the Sea&s;on be|came Ripe and fit for Action, it was re&s;ol|ved by the Captain General, the Cavalier <HI>Francis Moro&s;ini,</HI> with the Univer&s;al con&s;ent of all the Commanders at a Council of War held the 21&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> to enter the River of <HI>Patras,</HI> and accordingly the whole Fleet, with the Ve&s;&s;els which tran&s;ported the Land Forces, Provi&s;ions and Ammunition loo&s;ed from <HI>Glimino</HI> on the 20th of <HI>July,</HI> and made a glorious appearance in tho&s;e Seas, being compo&s;ed of Twenty &s;ix Gallies, &s;ix Galea&s;&s;es, be&s;ides Eighty &s;even Ve&s;&s;els of other &s;orts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vene|tian</HI> Ar|mado Sail to <HI>Patras.</HI></NOTE> that is to &s;ay, Ships, Pinks, Petaches and &s;uch like, who were all Commanded by the Governour <HI>Zaguri.</HI> This Fleet Sailing all that Night with a pro&s;perous Gale, on the 21&s;t in the Morning came in &s;ight of the Ca&s;tles and Fortre&s;s of <HI>Patras;</HI> at appear|ance of which the <HI>Turks</HI> being much alarum'd came down in great numbers, and pitched their Tents, &s;ome on the Top of a Hill, and others on the &s;ide of the main Ca&s;tle. The better to di&s;cover the State and Condition of the Turki&s;h Camp, the lighter Ve&s;&s;els were Commanded to Coa&s;t along the Shoar, by which and by &s;ome Spies it was known, and advi&s;ed in what manner their whole Camp was di&s;po&s;ed; a Detachment of which under &s;helter of a Trench, which they had thrown up, fired many Vollies of Small-&s;hot again&s;t the Ve&s;&s;els which coa&s;ted along the Shoar; but proceeded no farther to annoy their Enemies than unto the end of their Line;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Trenches.</NOTE> which when the Captain Ge|neral ob&s;erved, and the difficulty of Lan|ding near tho&s;e places, he enter'd into the River of <HI>Rumelia,</HI> which in like manner he found to be guarded by great numbers of <HI>Turks,</HI> and a Trench like the former ca&s;t up near the Ca&s;tle. The General <HI>Koni&s;mark</HI> (of whom with due Honour we have made men|tion in the Tran&s;actions of the la&s;t year, was embarked on the Admiral Gally with the Captain General, to have the better convenience to con&s;ult and confer together) was of Opinion, that notwith&s;tanding all the Preparations the <HI>Turks</HI> had made near the Ca&s;tle, and that the Seraskier of the <HI>Morea</HI> was encamped near the Town of <HI>Patras,</HI> and two other Pa&s;has not far di&s;tant from thence, and the Banks along Guarded by Parapets or Brea&s;t-works; yet, that the mo&s;t fit and commodious place to Land, was in the River of <HI>Patras</HI> it &s;elf; which be|ing agreed, the Troops were di&s;po&s;ed in an extraordinary manner of Military Di&s;cipline, and order'd &s;peedily to Land, which was done with great Re&s;olution: The fir&s;t to &s;et Foot on the Shoar were the <HI>Germans,</HI> who were

<P>The Troops being landed, and drawn up in Battalia, the <HI>Germans</HI> led the Van, and marching with great bravery to the Right, were charged by a &s;trong Detachment of the <HI>Turks;</HI> whom they received with &s;uch Vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Retreat.</NOTE> that they cau&s;ed them to Retreat, and afterwards betake them&s;elves to a &s;hameful Flight. This fir&s;t &s;tep being thus fortunately begun, gave Courage to the Chri&s;tians, and Re&s;olution to the Captain General <HI>Moro&s;ini,</HI> to fall on the Seraskier in his Camp be|fore he was reinforced by more Troops, which daily joyned with him. At fir&s;t land|ing all the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army con&s;i&s;ted of no more than Nine thou&s;and Foot, and Thirteen hundred Hor&s;e; tho&s;e Forces having been much dimini&s;hed by the Fatigues of the la&s;t year, and the Sickne&s;s of their Winter-Quarters, but now being recruited by great numbers of <HI>Levents</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> who as Volontiers came over from <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Cefalo|nia,</HI> the Army became numerous and capa|ble to undertake any Enterprize. But to facilitate the De&s;igns; it was adjudged ne|ce&s;&s;ary to cut off all Communication between the Ca&s;tles; the which was no &s;ooner or|dered than put in Execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Gal|lies pa&s;s the Ca&s;tles.</NOTE> by the entrance of divers Gallies, which by favour of the Night adventured to pa&s;s the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> or narrow Pa&s;&s;ages into the bottom of the Gulf, without any other hurt or lo&s;s, than of four or five Men at the Oars by a Can|non-&s;hot; the which Gallies were followed by a Galleot and three Felucas, Command|ed by <HI>Magnar,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Malta.</HI> This un|expected appearance of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Colours within the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> as it &s;truck a great Terror and Amazement to the <HI>Turks,</HI> being a Streight which they thought impo&s;&s;ible to be pa&s;&s;ed by any Ve&s;&s;el what&s;oever; &s;o it gave the Chri&s;tians a Re&s;olution to Attack the Seraskier, who according to a Report of certain Pri&s;oners taken in a Boat pa&s;&s;ing from the <HI>Morea</HI> to <HI>Rumelia</HI> &s;ide, lay not far off encamped with an Army of 10.000 Foot, and 4000 Hor&s;e; and that a Re&s;erve of 5000 Foot more, and 1000 Hor&s;e lay quar|tered about five <HI>Italian</HI> Miles from thence. The Gallies within the Gulf made great Tri|umph with their Flags and Streamers; and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of Fourteen Gali|ots or Brigantines, which had long &s;erved for Capers or Picaroons, to Rob and Plun|der in tho&s;e Seas. This Succe&s;s enlivening the Spirits of the Chri&s;tians, it was re&s;ol|ved at a Council of War, to March by the &s;ide of the Hill to attempt the Seraskier's Camp, as a way the lea&s;t incommoded by the Ene|my's Cannon; and where was place &s;uffici|ent to draw up the Battalions in good order.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this Re&s;olution on the 24th of <HI>July</HI> by break of day, General <HI>Ko|ni&s;mark</HI> drew up the Army, and di&s;po&s;ed them in order of Battle, and advanced boldly on the Enemy, who con&s;i&s;ted of Ten thou|&s;and Foot and Four thou&s;and Hor&s;e: And in the mean time the Captain General with &s;ome light Ve&s;&s;els directed the Galea&s;&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Koni&s;mark</HI> draws up the Army.</NOTE> to de+&s;troy a Battery of the Enemy erected near the Sea-&s;ide; and to drive out of a Trench two Troops of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, a Marine Regi|ment was landed under Command of Cap|tain <HI>Negro,</HI> who in a &s;hort time made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Battery, on which were divers Pieces of Cannon, two where|of were of Bra&s;s.</P>
<P>The Seraskier enraged at the lo&s;s of the&s;e places, and &s;eeing the Enemies Troops ad|vance upon him, feared to be a&s;&s;aulted in the Rear, or &s;urprized in their Trenches; to prevent which, he made a Detachment of &s;ome of his be&s;t Troops to meet the Enemy and Skirmi&s;h with them; in which Action th&ocirc; the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eemingly &s;hew|ed Re&s;olution; yet they did it in that loo&s;e manner, running at fir&s;t as it were on the Face of the Enemy, and then turning their Backs, as if they de&s;igned thereby to di&s;turb the good Order of the Chri&s;tians; who &s;till main|tained and kept their Ranks with a Regular &s;teddine&s;s, and &s;till advanced forward to come unto their de&s;ired Engagement. At length about three a Clock in the After-noon the <HI>Turks</HI> began to Skirmi&s;h with a Battalion Commanded by Colonel <HI>Ceclina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Fight.</NOTE> who &s;o well behaved them&s;elves, that they put the Ene|my to Flight: Which when the Seraskier ob&s;erved, he gave out the Signal for the whole Army to Engage, and to Charge the Chri&s;tians both in the Front and in the Flank, tru&s;ting to his Troops, which were much Superiour in number to their Ene|mies. Their fir&s;t attack was with the u&s;ual Cry of <HI>Alah, Alah,</HI> accompanied with the Vollies of all their Small-&s;hot, after which they fell furiou&s;ly on with their Scemyters in their Hands. The fir&s;t Fire was received and &s;u&s;tained by the <HI>Germans,</HI> flanked by the <HI>Cro|atian</HI> Cavalry of the left Wing, without moving the lea&s;t Step backwards, and par|ticularly by the old <HI>Veterane</HI> Regiments of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> who according to their u&s;ual Bravery, repul&s;ed the Enemy with conti|nued Vollies of Shot; and the Cavalry un|der Command of that renowned Captain the Marquis of <HI>Corbon,</HI> &s;o vigorou&s;ly &s;econded the Foot, that the <HI>Turks</HI> began to give Way and Retreat, and &s;oon afterwards to be|take them&s;elves to a &s;hameful Flight. The
<PB N="268" REF="147"> Chri&s;tians were very eager to pur&s;ue the flying Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> defeated.</NOTE> but the General <HI>Koni&s;mark</HI> &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome treacherous Ambu&s;cade, gave a &s;top to the Valiant Heat of his Army.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the Captain General took this opportunity to Command Cap|tain <HI>Negro</HI> with his Battalions to advance to the bottom of the Gulf of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> from whence all the Forces both of the Fleet, and the Land Soldiers giving a loud Shout, put the <HI>Turks</HI> into &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that they abandoned all their Works rai&s;ed at the bottom of the Gulf; and giving Fire fir&s;t to their Magazine of Powder and Am|munition, they followed the Example of their flying Seraskier or General.</P>
<P>In this manner by the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Di|vine Providence, this &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Pa|tras</HI> fell into the Hands of the <HI>Venetians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patras <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> which in former times had with&s;tood nu|merous Armies of the <HI>Turks.</HI> In ancient days <HI>Emanuel</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> find|ing him&s;elf not in a Condition to defend this place again&s;t the pro&s;perous, and the then &s;ucce&s;sful Arms of the <HI>Turks,</HI> re&s;igned it into the Hands of the <HI>Venetians</HI> to be defended by them, who &s;o well fortified the place with &s;uch Works and Cannon, that the <HI>Turks</HI> laying Siege thereunto in the year 1465, were able to avail nothing; but afterwards returning with a more powerful and invincible Army in the year 1496, and laying Siege to the place; after a long and valorous defence was forced to yield it &s;elf to the power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> in who&s;e Hands it hath ever remained, until this year of 1687, when it yielded it &s;elf to the Victo|rious Arms of the Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;oon as the News hereof came to the knowledge of the Captain General, he im|mediately weighed Anchor, and by break of Day in the Morning, Sailed with his whole Fleet under the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Rumelia,</HI> where he found <HI>Mahomet Pa&s;ha</HI> Encamped with Six thou&s;and Men. This Surprize was &s;o &s;udden, that the <HI>Turks</HI> having no time to con&s;ult, or &s;end for other Succours or Auxiliaries, with great Precipitation betook them&s;elves to a &s;hameful Flight, giving Fire in the fir&s;t place to all their Magazine of Powder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahoment Pa&s;ha</HI> put to Flight.</NOTE> the force of which &s;hook down a great part of that Wall which looks towards the Sea. Upon the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, the Cap|tain General following the Air of his good Fortune, Commanded all the Fleet to bring their Cha&s;e-guns on the Head of their Ships and Gallies, to bear on the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Le|panto,</HI> which was a mo&s;t admirable Stru|cture, and &s;o &s;trong, that in ancient times it had ruined tho&s;e Armies and Fleets, which had made Attacks upon it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort of <HI>Lepanto</HI> battered.</NOTE> But now the Fortune of the <HI>Turks</HI> being changed; and therewith their Spirits &s;unk and grown low, they were not able to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hot of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> but taking what&s;oever with them, that they could carry on their Backs and Shoulders, they abandoned the place, leaving a free acce&s;s and entrance there|into at the plea&s;ure and will of their Ene|mies: Thus did the <HI>Venetians</HI> in le&s;s than Twenty four hours time, erect their Flag on four &s;everal &s;trong Fortre&s;&s;es, with little damage on their &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sera&s;|kier Flies to <HI>Corinth.</HI></NOTE> but with con&s;iderable &s;laughter of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and lo&s;s of the greate&s;t part of the Baggage, Ammunition and Tents in their Camp; from whence the Seraskier marched with great fear and ha&s;t to <HI>Corinth.</HI> In the&s;e four places the <HI>Venetians</HI> took Sixty Pieces of Cannon, mo&s;t of them of Bra&s;s, with eight Pieces in the Camp of the Seraskier, and other &s;ix from the Camp of <HI>Mu&s;tapha Pa&s;ha,</HI> with great Stores of Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts.

<P>The General con&s;enting hereunto, the Tower and Wall were &s;urrendered, and the People civilly treated, according to the Con|vention: The Defendants of the middle Ca&s;tle, &s;eeing the lower Fortification in the hands of the Enemy, de&s;paired of all means longer to defend them&s;elves; and &s;o entring into Capitulations, de&s;ired Six days time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Al&s;o the middle Tower.</NOTE> that in ca&s;e the Succours came not to them within that Term, that then they would yield unto the Conditions of the Conqueror.

<P>Thus did <HI>Ca&s;tel Nuovo</HI> fall into the hands of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> being the more remarka|ble, becau&s;e it happened at a time, when Three Pa&s;has, with very numerous Troops, were in the Neighbourhood, and as we may &s;ay, in &s;ight of the place, with intention to &s;uccour and relieve it by force of Arms.</P>
<P>Nor was this Noble Proveditor-General the Cavalier <HI>Girolamo Cornaro,</HI> le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and renowned in taking the con&s;idera|ble Fortre&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;tel Nuovo,</HI> than he was in relieving and rai&s;ing the Siege which the <HI>Turks</HI> had formed again&s;t <HI>Singh;</HI> the which place this &s;ame <HI>Cornaro</HI> had in the Year 1676, taken from the <HI>Turks,</HI> being the fir&s;t of his Government of <HI>Dalmatia</HI> and <HI>Albania,</HI> and had now in this Year of 1687, the good fortune to pre&s;erve and maintain it from returning into the hands of its late barbarous Ma&s;ters. In which Action this Noble per&s;on de&s;erves as much Honour, as he purcha&s;ed in the Conque&s;t of it: It be|ing no le&s;s a Vertue to defend and con&s;erve, than to gain or win; according to that old &s;aying, <HI>Non minor e&s;t virtus, qu&agrave;m quaerere, parta tueri.</HI> <MILESTONE N="1687"> It being a great eye-&s;ore to the <HI>Turks</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Singh,</HI> their own Native Habita|tion, in the hands of the Chri&s;tians, they were moved with indignation, and with a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to recover it again into their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In pur&s;uance whereof <HI>At|leegick</HI> lately made Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> drew out his Army in &s;ight of <HI>Singh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> endeavour to take <HI>Singh.</HI></NOTE> and encamp|ed in the Plan of <HI>Clivino,</HI> where he pitched many Tents; and his Army being encrea&s;ed by great Numbers of <HI>Albanians,</HI> and the choice&s;t Soldiery of the Provinces round about, and provided with all &s;orts of Am|munition and Victuals both for Man and Hor&s;e, and with a con&s;iderable Train of Artillery, they thought upon their fir&s;t ap|pearance to affright the Garri&s;on of <HI>Singh</HI> into a &s;urrender. But the place having be|fore been well provided with all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and defended by a valorous Garri|&s;on, they contemned the Summons of their Enemies, re&s;olving to maintain the place to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>Whereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> having rai&s;ed their Batteries, began to play upon it with their Cannon, but without any damage to the Be|&s;ieged. Hereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> changed their Attack from that, to another part, where their Hor&s;e and Foot were drawn up in Mi|litary Order, with re&s;olution to Storm the place, which they attempted by break of day in the Morning, falling on with great fury,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Singh</HI> a&s;|&s;aulted by <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> and with their Scemyters in their hands thought immediately by force of Arms to carry the place: But the be&s;ieged &s;o bravely defended them&s;elves, that they gave them &s;uch repul&s;e, as cau&s;ed them to &s;ound a Retreat, leaving behind them many of their Soldiers dead on the place, to the number of about Two hundred, of which the great|e&s;t part were <HI>Albanians.</HI> In the Town the lo&s;s was very incon&s;iderable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are repul&s;ed.</NOTE> there being on|ly the chief Engineer killed, and &s;ome few per&s;ons wounded.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Proveditor-General <HI>Cornaro</HI> being informed of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, re&s;olved to give effectual relief to the Town; and accordingly he detached &s;everal Parties of <HI>Morlachs</HI> to infe&s;t the Enemy on all &s;ides; which they performed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that they returned with the Heads of many <HI>Turks,</HI> with Pri&s;oners in Chains, and with a con&s;iderable booty, and Numbers of Cattle, having had the fortune to defeat a Convoy which was &s;ent with Ammunition and Pro|vi&s;ions to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp.</P>
<P>How&s;oever the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;till continuing the Siege which had now la&s;ted Seventeen days, to which they had called all the <HI>Netferee,</HI> which are the Trained-Bands of the Country, and brought thereunto all the Cannon which remained in the fortified places round about; they did not doubt in a &s;hort time of the &s;ucce&s;s they de&s;ired.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege rai&s;ed.</NOTE> But all the&s;e hopes vani&s;hed away &s;o &s;oon as News came to <HI>Atleegick,</HI> that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army was on their march to relieve the Town, with which they were &s;o alarum'd and affrighted, that rai&s;ing their Camp, Tents, and Baggage, they quitted the Siege, and ran away with a &s;hameful and precipitate Cowardice. And thus ended the Succe&s;&s;es of this Year 1687, to the Glory of God, <MILESTONE N="1687"> and Confu&s;ion to the Enemies of the Chri&s;tian Faith. The Victories and Triumphs in <HI>Hungary</HI> gained by the Imperial Arms, were almo&s;t mira|culous, as is before related; the &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the <HI>Morea,</HI> with the &s;ubjection of <HI>Patras, Athens,</HI> and other places of <HI>Greece,</HI> were wonderful, and the relief given to <HI>Singh,</HI> and taking of <HI>Ca&s;tel Nuovo,</HI> were all works of the Divine Providence. And when we farther con&s;ider the Tumults, Seditions, and Mutinies among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves, to the depo&s;ing of their Sultan him&s;elf, and de&s;truction of their Chief and Principal Of|ficers by the madne&s;s and fury of the Sol|diers, even almo&s;t to to the total de&s;tructi|on of their Empire; we may believe, that the Hand of God was lifted up again&s;t this People, to bring them to the brink of Ruin, and Mi&s;ery, and cau&s;e them to cea&s;e, and be no longer a People.

And now <HI>Achmet</HI> finding it no time longer to conceal his Bu&s;ine&s;s, openly de|clared with Tears in his Eyes, That he was the more troubled for this misfortune, be|cau&s;e that thereby he could not an&s;wer the expectation of his Friends at <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Achmet</HI></NOTE> who had di&s;peeded him for <HI>Belgrade</HI> to give an Account to tho&s;e Governours of their di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition, and according to &s;uch An&s;wers, as they &s;hould receive from thence, to take a Re&s;olution either to De|fend or Surrender the Town. He farther added, That th&ocirc; &s;ometimes certain <HI>Hunga|rian</HI> Friends conveyed into the Town &s;ome Flour, Pea&s;e, Beans and Butter, yet it was in &s;uch &s;mall Quantities, that all was de|voured, and the People therein reduced to &s;uch Extremites, that in ca&s;e a &s;mall num|ber of <HI>Germans</HI> &s;hould appear with Cannon before the City, the Bodies of the Garri|&s;on,

<P>IF you enquire after the State of this City, and of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Soldiers therein, and in the Parts adjacent, all that we can &s;ay is, That we recommend theirs and our Condition to the mo&s;t High God, and to the Pious Compa&s;&s;ion of your Excellency; for that after all our Stores of Provi&s;ion, as well new, as old were con&s;umed, there remained a &s;mall quantity of Millet, which tho' it were &s;o old and corrupted, as if it had been laid in, at the fir&s;t Foundation of the City, yet it was delivered out and di&s;tri|buted among&s;t the Soldiers; the which being al&s;o con&s;umed, there remains not one Grane of any Corn among&s;t us; &s;o that we are reduced to a mo&s;t extream, and incredible Extremity: And what is wor&s;e, we cannot expect any Re|lief from the neighbouring parts; for that the Villages round about are revolted to the Ene|my, who in the la&s;t Summer burnt all our Corn upon the Ground; and in the Autumn made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the bordering Pa|lancaes, or Forts, namely <HI>Palotta, Chiocca</HI> and <HI>Bacchian;</HI> &s;o that at pre&s;ent being envi|roned on all &s;ides by Enemies, we dare not &s;tir abroad, but are forced to contain our &s;elves within the compa&s;s of four Walls. And indeed to &s;peak the Truth, we are in that &s;tar|ving Condition, that many have de&s;erted, and above Eight hundred of the Servants of God, have rather cho&s;en to yield them&s;elves Slaves to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> than to die by Hunger; and many of the&s;e have renounced our Holy Faith; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for us to hinder tho&s;e, who do daily de&s;ert us. Surely, mo&s;t Pious Lord, The Compa&s;&s;ion of our Sovereign is &s;uch, as will not permit his innocent People to peri&s;h, or to be trampled under the Feet of our Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;t happy Lord,</HI> The <HI>Giaurs</HI> or Infidels, &s;ince the taking of <HI>Agria,</HI> are come to take Winter-quarters in the Ca&s;tles, and Villages of our Neighbour-hood, and appear every Day in &s;ight of our Gates; and being puffed up with Pride, &s;ince the &s;ubjection of <HI>Agria</HI> and <HI>O&s;|&s;ech,</HI> they daily &s;end us Letters and Summons to Surrender; and now lately the third time, we received a mo&s;t in&s;olent Letter from a certain Captain, who &s;ays he belongs to the Religious at <HI>Vienna,</HI> inviting us to a Sur|render, promi&s;ing to Conduct us in &s;afety with our Goods and Families to &s;uch places, as we &s;hall de&s;ire; Threatning upon our refu&s;al to give us no Quarter, but to put us all to the Sword. And now at la&s;t another Me&s;&s;enger is come to us from the Commander of <HI>Palotta,</HI> whom out of pure Zeal to our Religion, we put to Death with Thou&s;ands of Torments: The next Day after which we made a Sally, in which the <HI>Giaurs</HI> (that is, the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) gained the advantage, killing and taking Pri|&s;oners, One hundred and fifty of our <HI>Zaims</HI> and <HI>Timariots,</HI> putting to Death afterwards all tho&s;e which they had taken; in Revenge of what we had committed on the Me&s;&s;enger, which they had &s;ent to us; and with the&s;e, many of our Servants became Martyrs for our Holy Faith; which &s;truck &s;uch a terrour into the Minds of our Citizens, <HI>Spahees</HI> and <HI>Jani|&s;aries,</HI> that above Two hundred of them con|veyed them&s;elves away in one Night.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;t valiant Lord,</HI> Be&s;ides tho&s;e Letters, which we have &s;ent by divers Conveyances to give a Relation of our mo&s;t mi&s;erable Condi|tion, we have yet farther to add, that our Souldiers finding them&s;elves de&s;perate, and out of all hopes of Relief and Succour, have &s;ometimes ari&s;en in a Mutiny upon us. For after they had eaten up all the Cattle and Oxen, and Fle&s;h which was in the Magazine, &s;o that an <HI>Oke</HI> (which is two pounds and a half) of Salt, is &s;old at four Dollars, and a Bu&s;hel of Millet at Twenty four Dollars; in which nece&s;|&s;ity and Famine, the Soldiers came upon us demanding Pay and Sub&s;i&s;tence; &s;aying, That they were obliged to remain only one year in the Town, and that then they &s;hould be relie|ved; but in&s;tead thereof, they had been con|tinued a year and a half in Famine, Naked|ne&s;s, and perpetual danger of their Lives; &s;o that the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who are to the number of Three hundred, have rent a&s;under all the Linings of the Tents for Cloth, and Linnen to cover and defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Cold. Wherefore mo&s;t Honoured, and mo&s;t Dread Lord; To quiet and appea&s;e the ju&s;t Complaints and Demands of our Soldiery, we have promi&s;ed that in the &s;pace of a Month, they &s;hall receive both Pay and Sub&s;i&s;tence: To which purpo&s;e, we have di&s;patched away the Bearer hereof, with &s;ome Camerades of his, to pre&s;ent, and expo&s;e our Grievances, Wants and Mi&s;eries, at the happy and &s;acred Feet of your Excellency, praying unto God, to Conduct him &s;afe to your mo&s;t revered Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>But if notwith&s;tanding all we have &s;aid, delay &s;hould be made to Succour us with a formidable Army, with Money and Provi&s;ions, God knows what will become of us; for in a &s;hort time our Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t have an end. If the General of the Emperor &s;hould come upon
<PB N="278" REF="152"> us, both We, and this City mu&s;t fall into his Hands. And then neither your Excellency, nor the Port can excu&s;e your &s;elves in &s;aying, That you were not timely advi&s;ed of our Mi&s;eries: For if in the &s;pace of a few Weeks we are not relieved, con&s;idering the People we have lo&s;t, and tho&s;e which die daily, God knows, you will never &s;ee more of our Letters: All depends on your Excellency.</P>

<P>The truth of the&s;e Matters was confir|med by a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> who had lately made an E&s;cape out of <HI>Alba Regalis;</HI> with this farther Addition, That the Commanders of that Town were &s;o grievou&s;ly importuned by the Garri&s;on and Inhabitants, that they were re&s;olved to di&s;patch another party of <HI>Turks,</HI> among&s;t which was one <HI>Ali</HI> Aga, a &s;ubtle and dexterous Per&s;on, who had been often a Pri&s;oner, and with one <HI>Wribech</HI> a Renegado, with In&s;tructions to repre&s;ent the State of their Affairs at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and to ha&s;ten the de&s;ired, and long expected Suc|cours. Be&s;ides which, the <HI>Turks</HI> were not wanting with all Diligence, Subtlety, and Money to provide what Su&s;tenance they were able, an occa&s;ion for which in a &s;hort time offered unto them: For Colonel <HI>Bi|&s;terzi</HI> Commander of <HI>Palotta,</HI> de&s;igning to furni&s;h <HI>Zioccha</HI> with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Provi|&s;ions; laded four Carts therewith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> Seize four Waggons with Pro|vi&s;ons.</NOTE> and di|&s;peeded them away under the Guard, and Conduct of Twenty four Mu&s;quetiers; of which the <HI>Turks</HI> being informed by a trea|cherous Per&s;on, detached that very Night a Party of Two hundred Men, to lie in wait in a Neighbouring Wood, attending the pa&s;&s;age of the Waggons, which &s;o for|tunately &s;ucceeded, that they &s;urprized them, and brought them with Twelve Mu&s;|quetiers of their Convoy into <HI>Alba Re|galis.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The People enraged hereat, drew up into a Body before the Vizier's Hou&s;e; and &s;ome of them ran upon the Walls, and drew from thence two Pieces of Cannon, intending therewith to batter down the Vizier's Palace; which was ready for Execution, when the Renegado</HI> Wrebeck, <HI>a Fellow very dear to the People, came with Tears in his Eyes, to di&s;&s;uade them from &s;o violent an Attempt; and having u&s;ed many very pungent Arguments to them, he prevailed &s;o far, that the Tumult was appea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>During this interval or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Arms, I, who was as it were the Tribune of the Peo|ple, was called again, and de&s;ired to appea&s;e the Multitude, promi&s;ing to an&s;wer their de|&s;ires: But they having been &s;o often deluded, refu&s;ed to give any Credit to their Words, unle&s;s they would &s;olemnly &s;wear on the</HI> Alcho|ran <HI>to yield the City; nor yet would they draw off, and return the Cannon unto the Walls, until &s;uch time as they had begun to make &s;ome &s;teps towards the execution of their de&s;ires.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hereupon the three Commanders, with &s;ome of the Citizens a&s;&s;embled in the great</HI> Mo&s;ch, <HI>as if they intended to agree upon the Propo&s;i|tions, which were to be offer'd to the Enemies; but in reality they intended nothing le&s;s, la|bouring all that Day to appea&s;e the Tumults with Mony and Provi&s;ions: The Vizier made large di&s;tributions to the</HI> Spahees, <HI>and the</HI>

<P>Colonel <HI>Riccardi</HI> having by this Relation been rightly informed of the true State of the Town, he thought fit to make Tryal of another Appearance before the Walls, and came with more than One hundred Hor&s;e within Cannon-&s;hot of the place, which had he done the preceeding Day, before the People had taken an Oath to hold out un|til St. <HI>George's</HI> Day, the City had mo&s;t cer|tainly been yielded: But now in&s;tead there|of, they made &s;everal Shots from the Ba&s;ti|ons, and &s;allied out both Hor&s;e and Foot, without any other execution on either &s;ide, than the taking of one <HI>Turk,</HI> who&s;e Head they cut off in &s;ight of his Companions.</P>
<P>Thus the Colonel having &s;ufficiently been informed of the State of the matter, on which he was employed, he departed from <HI>Palotta</HI> with his Troops on the 31&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1688"> and Lodging that Night within a League of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colonel</HI> Riccardi <HI>leaves</HI> Al|ba Regalis.</NOTE> a certain <HI>Ja|ni&s;ary</HI> well armed and clothed came to them in the Morning, and gave an Account that he was fled from the City with &s;ome other Companions, among&s;t which was an <HI>Odaba&s;hee,</HI> or Captain of the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who having been over active and forward in the late Mutiny, feared in cooler Blood to be cal|led to que&s;tion by the angred Officers.

<P>The ob&s;tinate Defence which <HI>Alba Rega|lis</HI> made, gave &s;ome trouble to the Court at <HI>Vienna;</HI> both becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to have it &s;ubjected before the beginning of the Campaign; and becau&s;e the Captive <HI>Turks</HI> and De&s;erters were &s;o numerous in tho&s;e parts, and in the Towns and Redoubts over all tho&s;e Qarters, as might give ju&s;t occa&s;ion of Jealou&s;ie and fear of Danger, in ca&s;e any de&s;ign of Ma&s;&s;acre, or A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination &s;hould be plotted by them: But &s;o vile and mean were the <HI>Turks</HI> e&s;teemed, and their price and value &s;o low, that a lu&s;ty Fellow was &s;old for a Dollar, and a Woman for a quarter.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t here take our leave of <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> for a while, and return to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> where we &s;hall find the Seditions and Military Mutinies broken out again with more Fury and Danger, even to the very &s;haking of the Foundations of the Empire, than at the latter end of the la&s;t year: For the Cabals daily increa&s;ed among&s;t the muti|nous Soldiers: They had lately received their pay, and were &s;atisfied in all they could de|mand; their Officers had &s;ome of them been di&s;placed, and others &s;trangled, as they were plea&s;ed to be&s;tow their Heads and Offices, but not being herewith contented, unle&s;s every one of them could be made a Vizier or Pa&s;ha,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutinies begin a|gain at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> they were emboldned to proceed to farther Outrages.

And indeed all things were at a &s;tand by the In&s;olencies of the Soldiers; the Officers both Civil and Military being di&s;couraged, and at a &s;top and full Period in the Grand Seignior's Service, had work enough to contrive, how to guard their own Per&s;ons again&s;t the violence of the Soldiers, and provide for the &s;afety of their own Lives.</P>
<P>The daily Cabals of Mutinous Soldiers having been held in &s;everal places of the City, were adjourned at length to the Vizier's own Hou&s;e, where with Menaces and great|er In&s;olencies than formerly, they demand|ed the removal of <HI>Kuperlee</HI> the <HI>Chimacam</HI> from his Office; &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kuperlee</HI> laid a&s;ide.</NOTE> That he was as bad a Man as his Father, who had &s;pilt Rivers of Blood, and ruined the Empire.

To oppo&s;e them herein had been to no purpo&s;e, and to expo&s;tulate with them had been equally dangerous; wherefore the Vizier being &s;en&s;ible of their Outragious and Irrational Humour, not pa|tient of the lea&s;t Contradiction, &s;eemed to concur with them in all they asked, and or|dered

This <HI>Zeni</HI> was an <HI>Albanian</HI> by Birth, and of good intere&s;t in his Country, and always bred up to the Wars, and e&s;teemed a brave Soldier; and being now &s;entenced to Dye, he made it his earne&s;t de&s;ire, that he might be &s;ent again&s;t the Grand Seignior's Enemies, that he might Dye in the mid&s;t of them with his Sword in his Hand; but he was to be Sa|crificed to the ba&s;e and rapacious Spirit of a Robber; for to &s;o vile and mean a Degree was the Greatne&s;s and Authority of this Empire fallen.</P>
<P>It being now the Month of <HI>March,</HI> when it was high time to form an Army with all Provi&s;ions of War for the Campaigne, fre|quent Con&s;ultations were held thereupon in the <HI>Divan.</HI> The New Vizier, as to him|&s;elf, was for &s;everal rea&s;ons unwilling to re|move from the Court to the Camp; For he was very poor when he came fir&s;t to that Office: And th&ocirc; the Conjuncture was fa|vourable, when he was at fir&s;t advanced to it, all Offices being then new Farmed, and let out through the whole Empire, which brought him at lea&s;t a Thou&s;and Pur&s;es of Money; yet the Equipage of a Grand Vi|zier for the War was va&s;t, and to one in his condition wholly disfurni&s;hed of Tents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier makes ex|cu&s;e for not going to the War.</NOTE> Hor&s;es, Camels, Mules, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would be un|&s;upportable: And this gave him a fair pre|tence to excu&s;e him&s;elf from going this Year to the Wars: Nor indeed was it his intere&s;t &s;o &s;oon to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the Grand Seignior's Pre&s;ence, until he had &s;etled him&s;elf in his Favour and Acquaint|ance, and introduced his own Creatures. Moreover his Age was great, and his Ex|perience in the War little; the Preparations for the War, by rea&s;on of the late Di&s;tra|ctions, and Inte&s;tine Troubles, Divi&s;ions, and all kinds of ill-management, were be|come very incon&s;iderable; &s;o that it was not without favour to the Vizier given out, that it was not for the Reputation of the Grand Seignior's Seal, and the Safety and Honour of the Prophet's Standard to be &s;o meanly attended. Whereupon it was con|cluded to make <HI>Yeghen</HI> a Vizier of the Bench,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yeghen</HI> intru&s;ted with the <HI>Army.</HI></NOTE> to &s;end him Three Hor&s;e-tails, and con|&s;titute him Sardar, or Major-General in <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>All this while <HI>Yeghen</HI> had not been idle, but had pur&s;ued his point of rai&s;ing Monies by all manner of Extortions, and at la&s;t very confidently wrote a Letter to the Vi|zier; importing, That in ca&s;e any Letters &s;hould have been wrote to the Port, con|taining Complaints of his having rai&s;ed great Sums upon the People; he de&s;ired the Vi|zier to peru&s;e the Account, whereby he would find that the Sums he had rai&s;ed, did almo&s;t amount unto One thou&s;and Pur&s;es, which he had employed to the payment of his Soldiers, <MILESTONE N="1688"> and to provide them with Nece&s;&s;a|ries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He de|mands Money.</NOTE> de&s;iring that One thou&s;and Pur&s;es more might be forthwith &s;ent him to pay off the remaining Arrears of the Army, which would &s;erve to keep the Soldiers in Order, and Obedience, and put both him|&s;elf and them in a convenient po&s;ture for the War.</P>
<P>But the Vizier was not very forward to &s;end him &s;upplies of Money, having taken a jealou&s;y, that by his various motions he in|tended to &s;et up for him&s;elf; for many of his Ancient Comrades came daily flocking over to him, and &s;ome privately from <HI>A&s;ia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier an&s;wers not.</NOTE> and therefore de&s;igned to remove him as far off from him, as he could, and give him his Hands full of bu&s;ine&s;s with the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e Rumours rai&s;ed once again new fears and di&s;tractions at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> for Reports flew about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New fears in the City from <HI>Yeghen.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Yeghen</HI> was on his march towards the City, where he had a &s;trong Party among&s;t the <HI>Giurbas,</HI> and others, giving out that he came to re&s;tore Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or his Son, to the Throne, all which being Fore-runners of a New Civil War, moved many rich <HI>Turks</HI> to leave the City, and &s;ome of them to retire to <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> the Sanctuary of Rich and Opulent <HI>Turks.</HI> The Vizier in the mean time to ob|&s;truct his March, &s;ent Ten or Twelve Cham|bers of <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> with &s;everal Pieces of Cannon to guard an important Pa&s;s, called <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha's Bridge, upon a River in the Mar&s;hes, about Six Hours Journey from <HI>Adrianople:</HI> And le&s;t he &s;hould have ano|ther de&s;ign in his Head of pa&s;&s;ing over into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> at the narrow Streight of the Hel|le&s;pont, <HI>Merza</HI> Pa&s;ha was &s;ent with other <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> to <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> where it was proba|ble he might attempt a pa&s;&s;age, it being re|ported, that he had already &s;ent Four hun|dred Pur&s;es, with many of his People by that way.

<P>During all the&s;e inte&s;tine Embroils, <MILESTONE N="1688"> no care was taken to oppo&s;e the Foreign and Common Enemy, all being abandoned to their Lu&s;t, until they could &s;ee an end of the Civil Wars.

<P>But now new Ma&s;ters, new Mea&s;ures; and <HI>Yeghen</HI> was to be Courted by Letters from the Vizier, declaring that the Sultan highly e&s;teemed his Fidelity and Bravery; and had pardoned him; and that now he &s;hould return to the Frontiers, and cheerfully attend the Service of the Sultan: As to his <HI>Kaiah</HI> he was continued in the Office, with the Title of Pa&s;ha of <HI>Caramania;</HI> but was ordered to &s;upply his Government with a <HI>Mu&s;&s;elim,</HI> or Deputy, but he him|&s;elf was ordered to &s;erve in the War.</P>

<PB N="291" REF="158"> Vizier intended to change the <HI>Pa&s;ha,</HI> which had but four Months before been entred into his Office: Upon which Report, after many Con&s;ultations held at Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> they re&s;olved to &s;end &s;everal of their <HI>Beys,</HI> or Lords, as Deputies to repre&s;ent unto the Vizier, that be&s;ides the great Tax laid upon the Country at the entrance of every new <HI>Pa&s;ha,</HI> it was contrary to the Priviledges, and Con&s;titutions of <HI>Egypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deputies &s;ent from Grand <HI>Cairo.</HI></NOTE> that their <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI> &s;hould be changed before the expiration of three years; the which they &s;upplicated the Vizier to con&s;ider, and to lay the&s;e their De&s;ires and Rea&s;ons before the Grand Seig|nior. The Vizier at fir&s;t an&s;wered them very roughly, and with Anger, telling them that this Me&s;&s;age which they brought aro&s;e from Humours and Seeds of Mutiny and Sedition, and the Contagion they had re|ceived from the Rebellious <HI>Giurbas;</HI> That they undertook to meddle in matters, which did not concern them; that they were the Grand Seignior's Subjects, and therefore ought quietly to &s;ubmit, to whom &s;oever it was his Imperial plea&s;ure to &s;et over them.

<P>But that which gave mo&s;t trouble, was certain Advice, that in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> great numbers of Thieves and Robbers infe&s;ted the Country, and that a Body of about Four thou&s;and Men had appeared before <HI>Angora;</HI> the Head, or Chief Commander of which was one <HI>Yedic,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Robbers in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> trou|ble the Country.</NOTE> under whom <HI>Yeghen</HI> had &s;erved as a Captain, before he came into the Grand Seignior's Service; he was a bold and an old Robber, who had long lived on Rapine and Spoil, and now commanding &s;o con&s;i|derable a Body of Hor&s;e, he ravaged all the Country, commanding free Quarters every where, and rai&s;ing Contributions and Taxes in all places according to his own Lu&s;t and Plea&s;ure; and hearing what &s;uc|ce&s;s <HI>Yeghen</HI> his Under-Officer had gained, he was willing to put in for a &s;hare with the re&s;t; offering him&s;elf and Forces to come over into Europe, and &s;erve the Grand Seig|nior in the Wars of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time al&s;o there hapned a Combu&s;tion in <HI>Candia,</HI> where the Soldiers mutined for want of Pay, and killed their <HI>Pa&s;ha,</HI> with the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and &s;ome others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutinies in <HI>Candia.</HI></NOTE> &s;eizing on the <HI>Pa&s;ha</HI>'s E&s;tate, which was accounted to amount unto &s;o much Money, as would pay the Soldiers all that was due to them.

<P>In the mean time <HI>I&s;mael Pa&s;ha</HI> the late Vizier was &s;ent on a Gally to guard <HI>Cavalla,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;mael <HI>bani&s;hed.</HI></NOTE> a Ca&s;tle near <HI>Salonica,</HI> which in effect was no other than an Honourable Bani&s;hment: And becau&s;e the Grand Seignior was not plea&s;ed to accept the offer made to him by <HI>Yedic,</HI> a <HI>Teftirgee Pa&s;ha,</HI> with &s;ome other or|dinary <HI>Pa&s;has,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yedic</HI> was to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> were di&s;patched into <HI>Anato|lia,</HI> to &s;ettle and &s;ecure the Country, and to reduce <HI>Yedic,</HI> and the Thieves his Com|plices to Obedience.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier now according to the Cu&s;tom of all his Predece&s;&s;ors, that he might &s;ettle him&s;elf more firm, began to make &s;e|veral changes in the Officers; among&s;t o|thers, he put out <HI>Ramadam Effendi,</HI> Lord Trea&s;urer in the late time of <HI>I&s;mael,</HI> placing in his &s;tead <HI>Mahomet Effendi,</HI> Trea&s;urer in the time, when the <HI>Giurbaes</HI> governed; an ill Man, and of a bad Reputation.</P>
<P>Nor could the Vizier think him&s;elf &s;e|cure whil&s;t <HI>Yeghen</HI> Command his Forces, &s;o near as <HI>Sophia,</HI> and was di&s;obedient to all Commands, a&s;piring to no le&s;s, than to be Seraskier or General of the Army; nor could it be thought, he would &s;top there, or at any other point until he came to be Grand Vizier: Wherefore <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Vizier, di&s;|patched private Orders to have <HI>Yeghen</HI> &s;trangled; who remained hovering about, between <HI>Belgrade</HI> and <HI>Sophia,</HI> keeping all Strangers from any near approach, &s;o that the execution of tho&s;e Orders were re&s;pited, until a more opportune conjuncture:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yeghen</HI> continues in Rebel|lion.</NOTE> For he continued &s;till in Rebellion, having refu&s;ed to go to <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> declaring that he would not give up the Command of Seraskier of the Ar|my in <HI>Hungary,</HI> to <HI>Ha&s;&s;an Pa&s;ha,</HI> or any other.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were in Agitation, an Envoy arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> from the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> with Letters of Com|plement to the Grand Seignior upon his Ex|altion to the Throne, and with Offers, <MILESTONE N="1688"> that as the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were united toge|ther again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;ulmen,</HI> &s;o he was ready to give his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Grand Seignior in defence of the Mahometan Faith.</P>
<P>It being now the Spring time, when the <HI>Turks</HI> always put their Hor&s;es out to Gra&s;s and Soil: The <HI>Imbrahor,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, invited the Grand Seignior into the Fields, to &s;ee in what order his Hor&s;es were governed at their Pa&s;ture; and there
<PB N="292" REF="159"> gave him a very Splendid Entertainment. The Grand Seignior was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Dinner, the Air, and the Fields, that in two or three days afterwards he went again to the Meadows at <HI>Cat-Hanah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The People di&s;plea&s;ed with the New <HI>Sul|tan.</HI></NOTE> about, two Engli&s;h Miles at farthe&s;t from <HI>Pera;</HI> where he was again fea&s;ted, not without the Cen|&s;ure and Murmuring, of the People; who &s;aid, That in a &s;hort time he would follow the Example of the late <HI>Sultan</HI> in his Diver|&s;ions, and Negligence in the Government, &s;o they &s;hould have changed (as indeed they had) to little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It began now plainly to appear, That the <HI>Turks</HI> by rea&s;on of their inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions, had made very incon&s;iderable Preparations either by Land or Sea: <MILESTONE N="1688"> How&s;oever &s;ome|thing was nece&s;&s;ary to be; and therefore in the fir&s;t place, Eleven Gallies were &s;ent to Guard the <HI>Black Sea</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who (as was reported) were preparing to make Incur&s;ions into the Parts near <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> as they had u&s;ually done in former times.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> make &s;mall Prepara|tions.</NOTE>But their chief Apprehen&s;ions and Fears were rai&s;ed from a Report, that the Imperi|ali&s;ts were marching towards <HI>Belgrade:</HI> And indeed they had great Rea&s;ons for it; for they had nothing of Force on the Frontiers, nor nothing to oppo&s;e them in ca&s;e the Em|peror &s;hould think fit to pu&s;h forward his Conque&s;ts, which nothing could ob&s;truct, be&s;ides Famine and Hunger in a March through a ruined, and a de&s;art Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> in the&s;e extremities, finding no &s;afety or &s;ucce&s;s, and protection in their Arms, had recour&s;e to their la&s;t refuge, which was, if po&s;&s;ible to obtain a Peace with the Emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They &s;eek for Peace.</NOTE> a Method, which they had never practi&s;ed before &s;ince they were an Empire, to be the fir&s;t to Sue for a Peace.

One <HI>Achmet Aga</HI> being propo&s;ed for this Emba&s;&s;y, he was &s;everally treated and fea&s;ted by the three Amba&s;&s;adors, who by the Di&s;cour&s;es they had entertained with him, ob&s;erved him to be a Per&s;on di&s;creet, and better practi&s;ed in Affairs of Countries different to their own, than commonly <HI>Turks</HI> are, who think it an Indignity to them, <MILESTONE N="1688"> to look into the States of Chri&s;tian Princes, which &s;o lately the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire over|looked, as unworthy their Con&s;ideration: To Tran&s;port this Amba&s;&s;ador a French-&s;hip was appointed, and his Equipage prepar'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Em|ba&s;&s;y put off.</NOTE> but by the Conduct of Sir <HI>William Trumbal,</HI> Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador then at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the confu&s;ed Affairs of the <HI>Turks,</HI> this Emba&s;&s;y did not &s;ucceed: And indeed the Turky Company could not expect to Reap any thing from thence, but trouble and ex|pence, and perhaps di&s;plea&s;ure at the Port, in ca&s;e his Entertainment had not equalled, that which he had received at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>How&s;oever, the <HI>Turks</HI> were better re&s;ol|ved in the Point of that Emba&s;&s;y, de&s;igned to the Emperor.

The&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors were appointed to begin their Journey to|wards the end of <HI>June,</HI> towards who&s;e ex|pences the Grand Seignior intended to allow Six thou&s;and Dollars; which was e&s;teemed a &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion for them, until they came to the Confines, whence according to the ancient Canon, they are to be conducted by the Emperor's Guards, and defray'd at his Expence: Their Retinue con&s;i&s;ted of 60 per|&s;ons, half of which was habited in the <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> and half after the <HI>Grecian</HI> Fa&s;hion.

<P>With great Rea&s;on may this pre&s;ent Age remain a&s;toni&s;hed, and envious Eyes become dazled with the Splendor of the Divine Cle|mency; which not &s;uffering its beloved Chri|&s;tendom to Groan longer under the Yoak of Barbarous Pride, nor remain in Bonds to Ty|rannical Servitude, nor longer to be overwhel|med, and drowned after &s;o many Wars in a Sea of Innocent Blood; hath at length out of his great Compa&s;&s;ion, been plea&s;ed to exert the &s;trong Power of his Omnipotent Arm, to Re|&s;cue &s;o many Kingdoms and Provinces, from an un&s;upportable Slavery under the <HI>Turks,</HI> who tran&s;ported with &s;en&s;ele&s;s Fury had ren|dered them&s;elves formidable to the World, ruinous to their Neighbours, and De&s;pi&s;ers of

<P>Such were the a&s;toni&s;hing operations of the Divine Power, made manife&s;t to all the World.

<P>It is now near an Age, that unhappy <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania</HI> hath been depre&s;&s;ed by the un&s;upporta|ble <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoak, and bewailed the lo&s;s of her lawful King and Lord: And after having been Turmoiled, to&s;&s;ed with Storms of War, with Fire and Sword, and Civil Di&s;&s;entions, all things have been &s;o confu&s;ed and defaced, that &s;carce any thing hath remained on the Regi&s;ters of it's ancient Glory; only &s;ince the Dominion of the <HI>Turk</HI> gained by the inte&s;tine differences of it's own Princes, &s;ome Memori|als are written, and re&s;erved to repre&s;ent to the World a Hi&s;tory of a mo&s;t direful Tragedy.

He was more fit for an Army than a Court; giving his Tongue too much liberty to Speak and Di&s;cour&s;e freely of the Faults and Defects of the chief Mini&s;ters of State; which be|got him &s;ome Enemies, but his Greatne&s;s of Mind, and Succe&s;s in War, carried him above all.</P>

His En|terprizes were always performed with great moderation, and Phlegm, watching his op|portunities of advantage upon the Enemy, and &s;eldom inclined to hazard any thing; his Coun&s;els were full of prudent Caution, which made his Performances &s;u&s;pected by the Enemy, fearing &s;ome Turn which they did not fore&s;ee. He was al&s;o a Courtier as well as a Soldier, and knew how to comport him&s;elf towards the chief Mini|&s;ters of State in the Court; as he did al&s;o to the Generals, and Officers, and Soldiers in the Camp.</P>

It is a great Que&s;tion from whence this Fire &s;hould proceed, &s;ome will have it from the Fires in the <HI>Kitchins,</HI> which were kindled about that time of the Day, for the u&s;e and purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing Meat and other Servi|ces; but that &s;eems unlikely; for the Kitchin Fires at that time of the Year and of the Day, being not great, might have been more ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed, and &s;mothered by the fall of &s;o much Brick and Rubbi&s;h, rather than kindled by the Beams and Rafters; wherefore I believe, that this Incendiation did proceed from an Irrup|tion of Subterranean Fires, which are the cau&s;e of Earthquakes: Thus was it, when the Mount <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> was blown up, and &s;o it was, and is when <HI>Mongibello</HI> Vomits out it's Flames, making all the Countries tremble round the I&s;land of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and &s;o it was in the Year 1666, when <HI>Ragu&s;i</HI> was de&s;troyed with an Earthquake, the Subter|ranean Fires de&s;troying what&s;oever re|mained under the Ruins: And &s;o it was at <HI>Lima</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1688"> where after the Earthquake a Fire broke forth, which con|&s;umed that City in the &s;ame manner, as afterwards it did at <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>

<P>WE have received your Letter from the Camp at <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> wherein you give us to under&s;tand, That an Amba&s;&s;ador by name <HI>Zulficar Effendi,</HI> and the fir&s;t Interpreter, have Orders from your Emperor to come to our Army: Now alth&ocirc; we being inclined to Mi|litary Actions, might well refu&s;e to receive them here; which none could take ami&s;s in this pre&s;ent heat of Affairs, or might put off their Reception until another time, &s;ince We judge that their Propo&s;als will little agree with our pre&s;ent Intentions: Yet being moved by a Chri&s;tian Compa&s;&s;ion, We do Grant that they may come to the Army: And We will fa|vourably hear, what your Emperor hath Com|manded them to propo&s;e unto us. To which end We have Commanded that a Pa&s;port &s;hall be prepared for their Security and delivered to the Per&s;ons, who brought your Letter. We have al&s;o given Orders to the Governour of <HI>Semandria,</HI> that in the manner directed him, and with a &s;ufficient number of Troops, he Con|duct them &s;afe to our Army.

<P>In pur&s;ance of this Letter, Orders were given to General <HI>Caraffa</HI> to go to <HI>Titul,</HI> and receive the Amba&s;&s;adors; but in the mean time the Siege proceeded, and Attacks were made with all the Fury and Vigour imaginable; many Pieces of the Cannon, which came from <HI>Buda,</HI> being ca&s;t in ha&s;t, bur&s;t one after another; &s;o that to &s;upply their defect, the Elector &s;ent for mo&s;t of the Cannon from <HI>Semandria;</HI> which being rai|&s;ed, and planted, did great Execution; and throwing Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es from Fifteen Mortars at a time, &s;truck Terror into the Defendants, and &s;et Fire to divers parts of the Fortre&s;s. How&s;oever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> throw Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es.</NOTE> the <HI>Turks</HI> man|fully applied them&s;elves to quench the Flames, and returned the Cannon-&s;hot and
<PB N="310" REF="169"> Bombs, with other artificial Fires made with Pitch, and Sulfur upon the Be&s;iegers, in the &s;ame manner, as they had practi&s;ed in the defence of <HI>Buda.</HI> They Sprang al&s;o one Mine, which venting about eight or ten Paces backwards, did no farther mi&s;chief, than the killing of one Man; but this be|ing followed by a Storm of Bombs, one of which falling into a Magazine, where &s;ome Hundreds of Weights of Powder, it blew all into the Air, without other Mi&s;chief than the Death of eight Common Soldi|ers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> believing that this Blow, and Springing of the la&s;t Mine, had cau&s;ed &s;ome di&s;order in the Trenches, made a violent Sally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They make a &s;ally, and are beaten back.</NOTE> with their Scemyters in their Hands in|to the Approaches; but being &s;trongly op|po&s;ed by a Captain who Commanded a Hundred Men, reinforced al&s;o by &s;ome Parties of <HI>Stra&s;&s;er</HI>'s Regiment, they were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of Forty of their Men, eight Imperiali&s;ts only being killed. The Fury of the <HI>Turks</HI> being hereby much abated; Differences, as is u&s;ual, aro&s;e be|tween the Commanders and the Souldiers; the fir&s;t &s;eemed re&s;olved to defend the For|tre&s;s to the la&s;t extremity, and la&s;t drop of their Blood, knowing that they could not long out-live any Surrender made upon Compo&s;ition: But the Soldiers, who could &s;ave their Lives on ea&s;ier Terms, were de|&s;irous to be freed from the Showers of Fire, which being continually poured upon them, did in the Night re&s;emble the dreadful Flames of <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> or <HI>Mongibello.</HI></P>
<P>The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> being well a&s;&s;u|red in the mean time, that the Conque&s;t of that Ca&s;tle would &s;hortly be added to the Triumphs of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> comes to the Camp.</NOTE> had time, with much quiet of mind, and without any di&s;traction to give a Magnificent Reception to the Duke of <HI>Loraine;</HI> who being now in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered from his late Sickne&s;s, could not ab&s;ent him&s;elf from Martial Ex|erci&s;es, at lea&s;t from being a Spectator, or bearing &s;ome &s;hare in this Heroick Enter|prize.</P>
<P>News being come, that the Duke of <HI>Loraine,</HI> having left his Royal Con&s;ort the Queen at <HI>Buda,</HI> was not far di&s;tant, the Elector accompanied with the Duke of <HI>Mantoua,</HI> and &s;everal of the General Offi|cers, went to him at the Foot of the Bridge, which was made over the <HI>Save,</HI> and there received him with the joyful Salutation of all the Cannon which were planted in the Lines of Circumvallation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is received by the Ele|ctor of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></NOTE> and by the Sol|diery drawn up in &s;everal Battalions; and having walked over all the Lines, and ob|&s;erved the di&s;po&s;ition of the Siege; all which being well approved, he was conducted to the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Tents, where he was &s;um|ptuou&s;ly treated by the Elector. After which, whil&s;t the&s;e Noble Generals were viewing the approaches, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;prang a &s;econd Mine under the main Battery; not far from the per&s;ons of the&s;e great Com|manders; who being re&s;erved by the Pro|vidence of God to reap more Laurels, re|mained untouched amid&s;t that danger. How|&s;oever the <HI>Turks</HI> thinking thereby to have gained &s;ome great advantage, made a brisk Sally, with Colours flying, and Drums beat|ing, drawn up in po&s;ture of Battel:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;pring ano|ther Mine, and make a &s;ally.</NOTE> The <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Franconians</HI> having then that place allotted them to Guard, gave way up|on the fir&s;t attack of the Enemy, and aban|doned their Po&s;t, leaving their Officers to the mercy of the Enemy, who were mi&s;e|rably &s;laughtered by them.</P>
<P>After which the <HI>Turks</HI> advancing to the Left, were &s;o warmly received,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> 1688.</NOTE> that they were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of many of their Soldiers: Soon after which the&s;e Illu&s;trious Dukes entred the approaches from whence the <HI>Turks</HI> had been beaten, and be&s;towed due Prai&s;es on tho&s;e Soldiers, who &s;o bravely and valiantly had behaved them&s;elves to the Reproach of tho&s;e, who cowardly re|treated. After which the Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> retired to the Quarters of his own Regi|ment of Hor&s;e, than which he had at that time no other Command in the Army, the whole conduct and General direction being entirely in the power of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>The Breaches being now made, &s;ome wi|der than others, the 5th of <HI>September</HI> was appointed for a day of a General A&s;&s;ault; which being come,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Septem.</HI> 1688.</NOTE> the whole Army remained in a readine&s;s to make the on-&s;et, and exe|cute the la&s;t Orders of their Generals;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An At|tack in|tended.</NOTE> when unexpectedly a Bomb from the Enemies Works fell among&s;t certain Barrels of Powder; which blowing up, over-turned the Works which belonged to Mines then preparing; and burned in a furious man|ner all things near it, killing divers Soldiers; and among&s;t the re&s;t was Count <HI>Guido</HI> of <HI>Staremberg,</HI> and Count <HI>Berzetti,</HI> Chief Di|rector of the Mines. This Fire was follow|ed by &s;uch a terrible Rain, which continu|ed all that day, and part of the Night fol|lowing, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to execute the intended Attack; but afterwards the Weather clearing up, the Mines were re|paired again in &s;uch manner, that at break of day in the Morning, Fire was given to them with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that the Ditch was filled up, and as it were, levelled as much as was needful.</P>
<P>The Attack was ordered to be made in Four &s;everal Quarters, that in the Front was commanded by the Elector him&s;elf: That on the Right-hand by the Prince of
<PB N="303" REF="169"> <HI>Commercy,</HI> on the Left by the Dragoons of General <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> and that next the Wa|ter by <HI>Pini</HI> Sergeant Major of the Regi|ment of <HI>Loraine.</HI></P>
<P>All things being in this manner di&s;po&s;ed in order for a general A&s;&s;ault, about Nine a Clock in the Morning the Signal was gi|ven to make the Attack, by Firing a Piece of Cannon in the Front of the Line of Cir|cumvallation, which was an&s;wered by a Shot to the Right, and &s;oon afterwards by Two others to the Left; which being the Signal to make the Attack, the A&s;&s;ailants entred the Ditch, where they were recei|ceived by infinite Vollies of Shot pouring upon them from all &s;ides;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belgrade <HI>Stormed.</HI></NOTE> which giving no &s;top to the Bravery and Courage of the Soldiers, they mounted to the top of the Breach, th&ocirc; the Earth was become &s;oft and &s;lippery by the late Rains.</P>
<P>From the height of this Breach, they took a Pro&s;pect of greater difficulties &s;till to overcome; for they were now to de&s;|cend into another Ditch, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had digged at the Foot of the in&s;ide of the Wall; and there to wrench up or beat down the Pali&s;adoes, which were planted on the top of the Ditch; and this was to be ex|ecuted in Contempt and De&s;pite of all the Shot, which the Be&s;ieged &s;hower'd from all &s;ides upon them; the which was &s;ufficient to intimidate and cool the Courage of the mo&s;t valiant Heroes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>Scherffem|berg</HI> killed.</NOTE> e&s;pecially when at the beginning of this danger they &s;aw their Leader Count <HI>Scherffemberg,</HI> and &s;oon af|terwards their Colonel Count <HI>Emanuel de Fur&s;temburg,</HI> who entred into his place, both killed before them, as was al&s;o Count <HI>Henric</HI> of <HI>Staremberg:</HI> And indeed the <HI>German</HI> Soldiers beginning a little to give Ground, were in danger totally to lo&s;e all the advantage which they had gained, had not the Elector him&s;elf expo&s;ed his own Per&s;on to all the Shot of the Enemy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ele|ctor &s;tands on the Breach.</NOTE> and &s;tanding upon the Breach with his Sword drawn, threatned the Life of any one who &s;hould dare to retire; and accordingly &s;ome were killed for the Terror of others.</P>
<P>The Soldiers animated by the Example of their General, and touched with a &s;en&s;e of Honour, de&s;cended with new re|&s;olution into the Ditch; and being well &s;econded by others, they mounted to the Top, where the Pali&s;adoes were Planted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> terrified with &s;o bold and &s;urprizing an Attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Capitu|late.</NOTE> fled trembling from the face of their Enemies, and crowded into the Ca&s;tle, between which and the Town, there was only a &s;ingle Bridge; where di&s;playing a White Flag, they de|manded to Capitulate for their Lives: But &s;ome of the more de&s;perate A&s;&s;ailants ha|ving no regard to Flags, or Colours, or what was acting, a&s;cended to the Tops of the Hou&s;es, and into Windows, and en|tred in at the Port-holes made for the Guns, where they made a mo&s;t horrible Ma&s;&s;acre of all that &s;tood before them, without re|gard to Age or Sex.</P>
<P>This Succe&s;s was in a great mea&s;ure ob|tained by the other Attack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The P. of <HI>Commercy</HI> enters on the other &s;ide.</NOTE> commanded by the Prince of <HI>Commercy;</HI> who th&ocirc; wounded in the Shoulder by a Mu&s;quet-Bullet, did yet overcome all difficulties, and enter victoriou&s;ly within the Walls.</P>
<P>On that &s;ide how&s;oever, where General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> commanded with his Dragoons, the oppo&s;ition was not &s;o great; &s;o that laying a&s;ide the Ladders which they had prepared for Scaling the Walls, they went directly to the Gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Heu&s;ler</HI> forces a Gate.</NOTE> and in &s;pite of all their Shot fixed a Petard thereunto, which intirely forced it from its Bolts and Hinges, and laid all open to the entrance of the Soldiers; how&s;oever at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the fir&s;t, another Wall pre&s;ented it &s;elf, well guarded, and defended with Sol|diers, who made continual Vollies upon the A&s;&s;ailants; to which there was an Iron-gate to pa&s;s, before entrance could be made; and that &s;o &s;trong, that it was judged al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be overthrown, during the Heat of this Action.</P>
<P>How&s;oever the Dragoons of <HI>Savoy</HI> being encouraged by their Prince, (who but &s;ome days before had been wounded in the Knee) leaped on the Wall, which was not very high, and de&s;perately threw them|&s;elves into the City; by which means be|coming Ma&s;ters of the Gate, they opened it, and let in a whole Torrent of the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Forces, who in a &s;hort time covered all the Streets with the Bodies of their Enemies: How&s;oever this Action co&s;t the Lives of above One hundred Dragoons of <HI>Savoy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;acre and Slaugh|ter of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> with &s;ome of their principal Offi|cers, among&s;t which was the Count of <HI>Ma&s;&s;el;</HI> and General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> had his Thumb &s;truck off with a Mu&s;quet-Bullet, which hindred nothing in pro&s;ecution of this Victory.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Turks</HI> endeavouring to e&s;cape the fury of the Soldiers by pa&s;&s;ing the River in Boats, fell into the hands of the <HI>Ger|mans,</HI> who gave them no better Quarter, than they had done to tho&s;e who defended the Breach.</P>
<PB N="312" REF="170">
<P>All being now &s;ubdued, and &s;ubjected to Victorious Arms of the Chri&s;tians, no place &s;tood out, but only a &s;mall Trench behind the Ca&s;tle, to which the Pa&s;ha or Commander in Chief, with the Aga of the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and &s;ome Officers had retired them&s;elves; and with them they took tho&s;e Slaves which they had maintained for their Service in the Ca&s;tle: The Sol|diers in their fury, not being &s;atiated with the Blood they had already &s;pilt, were di&s;|po&s;ed to bathe their Swords yet farther in the Bodies of this &s;mall remainder of their Enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa&s;ha and other Officers made Pri|&s;oners.</NOTE> and were ready to have executed, and wreak their final Rage on the Pa&s;ha, and Officers, when the Clemency of the mo&s;t Serene Elector, being moved by the Cries and Tears of the Chri&s;tian Captives, at their Petitions and Prayers, &s;pared the Lives of the <HI>Turks;</HI> being contented to &s;ee the <HI>Turks</HI> bound in the &s;ame Chains which they had newly taken from the Chri&s;tians: And yet the horrible Ma&s;&s;acre of the Sword did not cea&s;e in other parts of the City, all being filled with Confu&s;ion and Cruelty; when on a &s;udden a terrible Fire broke out in the lower Town, which burned with &s;o much Violence, that the Conquerors as well as the Conquered were willing to e&s;cape out at the Gates.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cruelty of the Sol|diers.</NOTE>It was grievous to &s;ee poor Old men made Pri&s;oners, dragged by their Beards, and Women and Maidens covered with Blood and, <MILESTONE N="1688"> Dirt drawn by the Hairs of the Head, and made the Sport and Pa&s;time of Military In&s;olence.</P>
<P>In Fine, the Fire being extingui&s;h|ed, Slaughter cea&s;ed, and about Noon the City and Ca&s;tle were intirely &s;ub|dued.</P>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>September</HI> when His Ele|ctoral Highne&s;s, and the other Generals rode Triumphantly into the City, behold|ing the dead Bodies, which filled the Streets, the Ruins of the Hou&s;es, and the De&s;tructi|on which the Bombs had made; And con&s;idering the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es to have pro|ceeded intirely from the Ble&s;&s;ing, and Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the God of Ho&s;ts; His Electoral Highne&s;s on the 7th of <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 7.

And a Ca|puchin after &s;aying Ma&s;s, was ordered by a &s;hort and devout Sermon to move the minds of the Soldiery to return Thanks unto God, who was the Giver of Victory; and to implore the Divine Benediction on the farther progre&s;s of their Arms. After which, all the Cannon of the Fortre&s;s, and of the Camp were Fired Three times, with loud <HI>Vive's</HI> re&s;ounding the Fame of <HI>Leopold,</HI> and <HI>Maximilian Emanuel.</HI></P>
<P>The day following the Elector invited all the Generals, and Chief Officers of the Army to a &s;umptuous Banquet, at which al&s;o the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors happened to be pre&s;ent; for whom, and his Retinue, (as we mentioned before) the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo</HI> had de&s;ired a Pa&s;s.</P>
<P>When this Amba&s;&s;ador approached near the Camp, he was &s;trangely &s;urprized to hear all things &s;o quiet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor comes to the Camp.</NOTE> no Noi&s;e of Guns or other In&s;truments of War; but coming yet nearer, his Eyes convinced him (when he &s;aw the Imperial Eagles advanced on the Walls) that the Town was taken.</P>
<P>News being brought to the Elector, that the Amba&s;&s;ador was come, he was con|ducted with his Interpreter <HI>Mauro-cordato,</HI> and his Followers on Hor&s;eback into the Court-yard, of the Hou&s;e where the Ele|ctor was lodged; and there being alighted, he was conducted up Stairs by Two Gen|tlemen, to the Chamber where the Elector was &s;eated, with whom at his fir&s;t Entrance, he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Complements of Thanks, for the Pa&s;sport and Convoy which he had &s;o obligingly be&s;towed upon him.</P>
<P>After which he was led into a large Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Fea&s;ted with the Generals.</NOTE> where a &s;umptuous Table was &s;pread. The Elector took the Upper-end, at his Right-hand was placed the Duke of <HI>Mantoua,</HI> on his Left the Ottoman Amba&s;&s;ador; and by his &s;ide the Interpreter was &s;eated.</P>
<P>By the Duke were placed the Generals <HI>Caprara, Dunewalt, Heu&s;ler, Rabattin;</HI> Prince <HI>Charles, Philip</HI> of <HI>Hannover,</HI> the Vice-Commi&s;&s;ary <HI>Falchenhan,</HI> Count of <HI>Oetting, Sauran, Stirum, Gronsfelt, Monte|cucoli, Palfi,</HI> and <HI>Sereni;</HI> which filled and crowned the Table with chearful Counte|nances, whil&s;t the Amba&s;&s;ador drooping in his Spirits, could not hide and &s;uppre&s;s his Sorrow from appearing in his looks: The jollity of the&s;e Victorious Officers, was a Ponyard to his Heart, which very ill agreed with &s;o much Fe&s;tivity and Mirth of his Enemies; and of the principal Offi|cers, who in very rich Habits encircled the Table. How&s;oever being con&s;trained to &s;ay &s;omething, which might not betray his dejection of mind; ca&s;ting his Eyes round upon the Company, he &s;aid to the Elector, <HI>That he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the ap|pearance of &s;o many hand&s;ome and accom|pli&s;hed
<PB N="313" REF="170"> Per&s;onages: But one thing he ob&s;erved, That the Emperor of the</HI> Romans <HI>was &s;erved by Young Generals; at which he could not much wonder; for when he con&s;idered, how they daily expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the mo&s;t de&s;|perate dangers, there &s;eemed an impo&s;&s;ibility almo&s;t for them to &s;urvive till old Age:</HI> Thus far it had been well, if he had &s;topped at this period of Complement.</P>
<P>But pur&s;uing his Di&s;cour&s;e farther, he told them, that the Year before he had been at the Battel of <HI>Hat&s;chan.</HI> To which the Elector Replied, <HI>That certainly he mu&s;t have had a good Hor&s;e,</HI> meaning to e&s;|cape and run away; which cau&s;ed &s;ome Laughter.</P>
<P>During the time of Dinner, the Trum|pets, Haut-boys, and other In&s;truments were &s;ounded; and Healths drank round in full Cups of Wine; to the Emperor; to the continuance of pro&s;perous Succe&s;&s;es to his Arms; and the Third to the Health of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperor; To all which the Amba&s;&s;a|dor did rea&s;on in <HI>Sherbet</HI> of <HI>Lemmons</HI> Wine, being both again&s;t his Religion and his Cu|&s;tom to Drink.

<P>The taking of the Town, and City of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> was of a mo&s;t fatal Importance to the <HI>Turks;</HI> for thereby the Way was laid opened to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> no Garri&s;ons lay between them and <HI>Belgrade,</HI> nor Forces to oppo&s;e the March of the Im|perial Arms; unle&s;s Scarcity and want of Provi&s;ions through a de&s;olate Country, in many places full of Rocks and Mountains, to be pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould bring more difficulty to the progre&s;s of a Victorious Army, than the Troops of their Enemies.</P>
<P>Nor did this Campaigne end as yet with the Conque&s;t of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> being &s;econded by others of equal advantage in <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> under the au&s;picious Conduct of that Re|nowned and Fortunate General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Topal <HI>&s;ig|nifie</HI> Lume.</NOTE> Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> whom we left lately at <HI>Po&s;&s;ega,</HI> with de&s;ign to attack <HI>Topal,</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> who had Encamp|ed him&s;elf under <HI>Tervat</HI> or <HI>Terwent,</HI> near the River of <HI>Ucraine,</HI> about Five Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Proot,</HI> which Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> had fortified, to facilitate his pa&s;&s;age more ea&s;ily into <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> and to &s;ecure the Communication between the Neighbouring Forts: And there al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed a Bridge over the <HI>Save;</HI> which being fini&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688. <HI>Septem.</HI></NOTE> on the Third of <HI>September,</HI> he cau&s;ed his Baggage to pa&s;s over, and the next day followed with his whole Army, in hopes to have drawn the Pa&s;ha from his Encampment; of who&s;e Number the Prince had no very good Account;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. <HI>Lewis</HI> pa&s;&s;es the <HI>Save.</HI></NOTE> but being reported to be much le&s;s than they were, the Prince marched the Fourth In&s;tant in the Evening &s;ilently, and without Noi&s;e to a&s;&s;ault the Enemy in the Camp; and having pa&s;&s;ed that Night through many &s;trait and difficult Ways, they arrived next Morning by break of day within &s;ight of the advanced Guards of the Enemy, who gave the fir&s;t Alarum; up|on which the Pa&s;has was the fir&s;t to Mount on Hor&s;eback, and immediately drew forth his Troops, placing them in order of Bat|tel; the Hor&s;e into Two Wings, and the Foot in the middle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> a&s;&s;ault the <HI>Germans.</HI></NOTE> The Force conducted by Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> was no &s;tronger in all than Three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and Three hun|dred <HI>Croats;</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI> by &s;everal Re|cruits which had lately joyned them, were in all Fifteen thou&s;and Fighting-men; by which inequality of Numbers, the <HI>Turks</HI> judging them&s;elves &s;ecure of Victory, furiou&s;ly at|tacked the Prince, who had al&s;o divided his Squadrons of Hor&s;e into Two Wings, the Right Commanded by <HI>Piccolomini,</HI> and the Left by Count <HI>Ca&s;telli,</HI> both Generals of Battalia.</P>

<P>This &s;urprizing Irruption of the <HI>French</HI> into <HI>Germany</HI> being carried by an Expre&s;s to his Electoral Highne&s;s at <HI>Belgrade</HI> gave (as we have &s;aid) a &s;top to the progre&s;s of his Victorious Arms again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> &s;o that having committed the Command of the Imperial Forces to the au&s;picious Conduct and Care of General <HI>Caprara;</HI> he returned with all Expedition to <HI>Vienna,</HI> command|ing his own Forces to follow him.</P>

<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> finding it more ea&s;ie to pro|ceed on the Attack of the Town, than to lo&s;e time in taking the Fort of <HI>Carababa,</HI> they rai&s;ed a new Battery upon a &s;mall Rock, at the Entrance of the Port under Command of the Captain of the Gulf, which he effected with his own, and the help of another Galley.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vene|tian</HI> Camp wa&s;ted with Sickne&s;s.</NOTE> But what mo&s;t incommo|ded the <HI>Venetian</HI> Camp, was the exce&s;&s;ive Heats; for tho' the Winds were Northerly, as they commonly are in tho&s;e Seas; yet pa&s;&s;ing over the Land, they contracted &s;uch Heat, and carried with them &s;uch a kind of Noxious, and Sulphureous Vapour, as pro|duced Malignant Fevers among&s;t the Soldi|ers, and Officers, that many of them Died, and the Camp became enfeebled, and much weakened; among&s;t which was General <HI>Ko|ni&s;mark;</HI> who being forced to leave the Camp, to go Aboard his Ship in order to his Cure, his Command was committed to the Charge of Major General <HI>Horn</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;|wick.</HI> The Sickne&s;s &s;till &s;preading with Fe|vers and Tertian Agues, a Sergeant Gene|ral of Battallia, <HI>Pietro Ga&s;pari,</HI> and Colonel of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> died thereof; and the Count <HI>Palatine</HI> Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> redu|ced to the la&s;t Extremity; &s;o that many De&s;igns were neglected, which might have gained the City, and all the Enterpri&s;es of the Army became faint and langui&s;hing.

<P>The Morning of the 20th being come every one prepared him&s;elf for the intend|ed A&s;&s;ault on the Enemies Trenches.

<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> re&s;olving that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould not remain in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Bonnet, attacked them again therein, and drove them thence, and fortified it in &s;uch manner, that it would be very diffi|cult for them to regain it.

<P>The day following was appointed for that general A&s;&s;ault, which was to deter|mine the Fate of that place; when above 8000 Men were po&s;ted in their &s;everal Stations, and every thing di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch manner as was requi&s;ite for this great Work; Likewi&s;e <HI>Ale&s;&s;andro Bon,</HI> the Cap|tain of the Gulf, was Commanded with his Squadron to enter the Port on the Lar-board-&s;ide, and Inve&s;t the Fort of <HI>Ca|rababa,</HI> whereby the Garri&s;on therein might be diverted from &s;ending their Forces for &s;uccour of the Town.</P>

<P>Had the Project of Quartering all that Winter on the I&s;land &s;ucceeded, it was ve|ry probable, and with good rea&s;on it might have been rationally concluded, that the City would have been obliged to yield be|fore the Spring;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Foreign Troops mu|tiny, and will not Winter on the I&s;land.</NOTE> but the Foreign Troops being acquainted with the De&s;ign, began to mutiny, and loudly to declare, That they would not Winter on the I&s;land, it being one of their Capitulations of Agreement, when they fir&s;t Enrolled them&s;elves for Soldiers, that they &s;hould at the Sea&s;on when Armies u&s;ually break up their Camp, be provided with warm and convenient Quarters, and with the Spring return again into the Field.</P>
<P>To force the Soldiers to an Obedience in this particular, was not e&s;teemed advi&s;eable; but to try how far &s;oft Terms and per&s;wa|&s;ive Arguments might prevail upon them, &s;everal Noblemen, and chief Commanders were employed to incline the Wills and Con&s;ent of the Soldiery thereunto; but the Plot was deeper laid, for tho' the Com|monalty only appeared openly therein, yet it was well known, that their Officers had the chief Hand in the De&s;ign, and in&s;tiga|ted their Soldiers to act that part which was mo&s;t de&s;ired by them&s;elves.

The next Day Summons were &s;ent to the Garri&s;on, which being an&s;wered with Vollies of &s;mall and great Shot, the Night following the Trenches were open|ed, and in the Morning the Cannon and Mortars began to play upon the Town with great execution.</P>

<P>The Day following in the Morning, a|bout 900 Women and Children came forth, and about 400 <HI>Turks</HI> capable to bear Arms, with Countenances full of Sorrow, and de|jected Looks, which &s;howed the inward Grief which oppre&s;&s;ed their Spirits.

<P>And becau&s;e it might rationally be con|jectured, that the <HI>Turks</HI> would before the Morning, fortifie their Camp with &s;ome Trenches, and Parapets of Earth; the Prince re&s;olved without giving them &s;o much time, to advance upon them with all the Courage and Fury imaginable; extending his right Wing towards the Foot of the Hill, and his left along the Plain to the Banks of the Ri|ver <HI>Ni&s;&s;ava;</HI> which being orderly di&s;po&s;ed, re&s;olutely Attacked the Enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr. <HI>Lewis</HI> Attacks the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> according to the Methods and Mea&s;ures de&s;ign'd.</P>

<P>On the other &s;ide the Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of <HI>Croy</HI> &s;uc|cours the right Wing</NOTE> who commanded towards the River, being ad|vi&s;ed by the Prince, that the right Wing was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and hardly be&s;et by the E|nemy, he pre&s;ently re&s;olved to advance to the top of the Hill in a direct Line towards their Succour, to give a greater Diver&s;ion to the Enemy, and to gain the top of the Hill; the which being effected, the Situa|tion thereof proved &s;o advantageous a Po&s;t, that in a &s;hort time they drove the Enemy from thence with a con&s;iderable Slaughter. Notwith&s;tanding which, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e rallying again in the Plains, made another Vigorous A&s;&s;ault on the left Wing, but

<P>Thus the Night put an end to the Victo|ry, and the Slaughter of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who a|bandoned the City tho' fortified with a good Ditch, and &s;ome Pali&s;adoes, after the <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI> manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> gain an en|tire Victory</NOTE> tho' irregularly planted; the &s;ame Night Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> put into the Town, &s;everal Battalions to con&s;erve it from being burnt, as the <HI>Turks</HI> intended to have done.

<P>Afterward Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> having vi&s;ited the City, ob&s;erved that it was fortified only with a &s;ingle Ditch and &s;ome Pali&s;adoes; how&s;oever it was judged very convenient for Winter Quarters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is fort+fied for Winter Quarters.</NOTE> and therefore ordered that it &s;hould be &s;omething better fortified, by the Work of 2000 Foot, which were drawn out of &s;everal Regiments to labour on the Fortifications, which in a &s;hort time was brought to that condition, as to render it capable of being the head Quarters for the whole Winter, where Provi&s;ions were accordingly laid up in Store-hou&s;es for Sub|&s;i&s;tence of the whole Army.

<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> gained greater Honour by this Action than by any other of this Summer's Expedition; for their Forces were few, and the Enemies fought with more Re&s;olution and Bravery than they had done in any former Engagement; for in none were more killed, and wounded than in this.

<P N="2">II. That the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> favoured rather by Fortune, than by the &s;trength of their own Power, had gained all tho&s;e Victories of which they now Triumph.</P>

<P N="5">V. That the Taxes on the People, were rai&s;ed from five Dollars on every Hou&s;e, un|to a hundred.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wers to the Con&s;iderations Offered.</HEAD>
<P>TO the Fir&s;t it was reply'd, That the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Power con&s;i&s;ted more in Numbers than in Force; an Evidence where|of appears to the World, in that the <HI>Turks,</HI> who for the &s;pace of 300 Years had waged a War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> do now &s;carce po&s;&s;e&s;s a Foot, or Palm of that Kingdom, unle&s;s in &s;ome few Cities, which are yet &s;o &s;treight|ned by Blockades, that they are ready to peri&s;h with Famine, and offer them&s;elves up to the Mercy of the Emperor. Witne&s;s al&s;o the Succe&s;s before <HI>Vienna,</HI> when Be&s;ieg|ed by 300000 <HI>Turks,</HI> were not yet able to render them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the &s;ame, but were forced to fly, and ignominiou&s;ly to turn their Backs to a quarter part of their Number, and forced to return without o|ther Glory, than that only of burning &s;ome Villages, which might have been done by a Rabble of People, or 100 Incendiaries.</P>
<P>To the Second it was &s;aid, That with the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Troops, tho' much inferiour in Number to tho&s;e of the <HI>Turks,</HI> had won divers Battles during this War, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of many Towns, and Ca&s;tles; and particular|ly of <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Capital Cities of great Provinces, which were not &s;ubdu|ed by long Sieges, but by Storms, and dint of Sword.</P>
<P>To the Third it was &s;aid, That the Trou|bles in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> &s;till continued, and their Civil and Dome&s;tick Seditions, not as yet ap|pea&s;ed, and were yet likely to increa&s;e higher, by rea&s;on of their Tyrannical Go|vernment, which the oppre&s;&s;ed People would not longer endure.</P>
<P>To the Fourth it was &s;aid, That the Di&s;|charge of the Women, and Officers, to the Number of 4000 out of the Seraglio, was an evident Token of their want of Money to &s;u&s;tain the War.</P>
<P>To the Fifth it was &s;aid, That the heavy Burden of Taxes, from five to a 100, was the ready means to move the People to a Rebellion, of which there are frequent Ex|amples in all Hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>To the Sixth, that how&s;oever the <HI>Turks</HI> might flatter them&s;elves with the pacificati|on of God's Anger again&s;t them, they would yet find the contrary, and prove the ju&s;t Revenge of the Ju&s;t God, whom they had provoked by the Breach of their Faith, and Oppre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e People whom they had &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>To the Seventh, That there was great difference between Soldiers and Incendia|ries, in the latter of which the <HI>Turks</HI> ought rather to be reckoned, than among&s;t the for|mer.</P>
<P>To the Eighth, which concerns the Sur|render of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> it was replyed, That the Emperor would &s;ooner &s;urrender <HI>New|&s;tadt</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> or the Gardens about <HI>Vien|na,</HI> than that City, with which this Confe|rence was concluded.</P>

<P>Among&s;t all the foregoing Particulars, we find nothing &s;olid or material, or under any Di&s;pute, unle&s;s that point of exchang|ing <HI>Belgrade</HI> for &s;ome other place or places, not as yet Conquered in <HI>Hungary;</HI> that &s;o the River <HI>Save</HI> might be the limit and con|fine between the two Empires: Nor was it probable, that the <HI>Turks</HI> would have bro|ken off the Treaty on this Point only, had

But this Opportunity be|ing let &s;lip, Fortune changed its Cour&s;e, and the Exploits of War were acted with various Succe&s;&s;es; and tho' afterwards the Emperor &s;ought for Peace by Interpo&s;ition of Mediators, the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;o far enga|ged with the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;o encouraged by their Succe&s;&s;es, that they would now hear|ken to nothing under the Surrender of <HI>Buda,</HI> and all the Conque&s;ts in <HI>Hun|gary.</HI></P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of this Opportunity for gain|ing a Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea|&s;ons for which the Peace was ob&s;tructed.</NOTE> may be attributed to the In|fatuation of the Minds of the <HI>Germans,</HI> blinded for puni&s;hment of the Sins of <HI>Chri|&s;tendom.</HI> No doubt but the <HI>French</HI> Facti|on in the Imperial Court, availed much in the defeat of this De&s;ign, as did al&s;o the power of the Papal Court, in which at that time <HI>Alexander</HI> VIII. reigned; who hear|ing of the Overtures of Peace treating at <HI>Ausburg</HI> and <HI>Vienna,</HI> di&s;patched away from <HI>Rome,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Colonitz,</HI> with In&s;tructi|ons about the Affairs of <HI>Hungary,</HI> who af|ter having a&s;&s;i&s;ted in divers Con&s;ultations, and Conferences thereupon, the whole Treaty broke off, and the Amba&s;&s;adors di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from all farther Negotiations, of which we &s;hall very &s;peedily bewail the fatal Effects.</P>

<P>In the Morning the Ships were ob&s;erved to be at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Shore, and at lea&s;t ten Miles from the Gallies, which were making their way to Cape St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> the which gave &s;ome Trouble to the Doge, by thinking, that in ca&s;e the&s;e two Divi&s;ions were &s;o far &s;eparated at the beginning, what would become of them before the end of the Voyage; Whil&s;t the Doge thought of the&s;e things, a great Fleet appeared Steering directly to that Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Gua|dagne</HI> joyns the Fleet.</NOTE> which coming nearer was found to be the Fleet which brought the Duke of <HI>Guadagne,</HI> Serjeant-General Baron <HI>Spaar,</HI> and &s;everal other Officers, with 333 Foot Soldiers.</P>

<P>There were four Propo&s;itions made for employing their Arms, and four De&s;igns offered, but they were all of &s;o different a Nature, that they could not come to any Determination at that Meeting; but at length, after various Reflections made on the nece&s;&s;ity there was of coming to a Re&s;olution, it was concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re&s;ult of a Coun|cil of War.</NOTE> That General <HI>Guadagne</HI> &s;hould with his Cavalry take a view of the Streight of <HI>Corinth,</HI> (which is that Neck of Land which joyns the <HI>Morea</HI> to <HI>Greece</HI>) and upon a Survey thereof to make a Calculate, how many Men would be required to Maintain and Defend that Pa&s;s in ca&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould endeavour to force their entrance that way into the <HI>Morea,</HI> it being of great impor|tance to fortifie that pa&s;&s;age, and not leave it open, and undefended to the Incur&s;ion of the <HI>Turks;</HI> whil&s;t the Armata &s;hould be employed on other Enterprizes.</P>

How&s;oever at length, after long Debates, they re&s;olved at a Council of War, (that their Arms might not remain longer unemployed) to dis-&s;peed the Cavalry, which were to march by Land, and 3000 Foot Soldiers to be embarked on the Ships, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of Pro|vi&s;ions both for Arms, and Victuals, and therewith to &s;ail to the Streight of <HI>Corinth,</HI> to di&s;appoint the Seraskier of all hopes of Entrance into the <HI>Morea:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nar|row of <HI>Co|rinth</HI> for|tified.</NOTE> The Prince <HI>Har|court</HI> was to Command the Hor&s;e, accom|panied with the Sergeant-General <HI>Spaar;</HI> who joyning with the Auxiliaries of that Country under the Command of <HI>Dambi,</HI> it was calculated, that they might form a Bo|dy of about 7000 fighting Men effective; who were to be attended by <HI>Cornaro</HI> the Proveditor-General, who, with &s;ome Gal|lies, was to a&s;&s;i&s;t as any occa&s;ion &s;hould oc|cur.</P>

<P>The Doge in the mean time removed from the Fort of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which was the <HI>Old Malva&s;ia,</HI> towards the New Forts, which being entirely compleated, four pie|ces of great Cannon of 50 Pound Bullet were Landed, and planted on the principal Fortre&s;s, whence they greatly annoyed the <HI>Turks;</HI> how&s;oever the Enemy was not neg|ligent on the other &s;ide to ply their Can|non on that part which is neare&s;t to the Bridge.</P>

<P>About this time Prince <HI>Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> arrived at the Armata, where the Day following he was received with the u|&s;ual Ceremony by the Doge; he brought with him no more force than what &s;erved for his own Equipage, and for the better Defence of the Ship, on which he was Em|barked: but &s;o &s;oon as this Prince had per|formed his Complements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Storm endangers the Gallies.</NOTE> a &s;udden Storm aro&s;e with Hail and Wind, &s;o violent, as put all the Gallies into imminent danger; &s;ome lo&s;t their Bolt&s;prits, others their Main-Yards, others had their Oars broken, &s;ome had their Poops blown away, and Boats were overturned, with &s;uch prodigious Hail,

<P>But this Wind which was beneficial to the Gallies of <HI>Malta,</HI> was &s;o prejudicial and dangerous to the Palanders, as put them be&s;ides all their Works and Operations; &s;o that in&s;tead of annoying the Town, they had Bu&s;ine&s;s enough to &s;ave them&s;elves from &s;inking in the Seas, which the Nor|therly Winds drove violently upon them: So that now the Be&s;iegers had nothing to annoy the Enemy, but what was thrown from the Forts erected on the Land.</P>

<P>It being ob&s;erved by the Doge, that not|with&s;tanding all their Endeavours, no great Advancement was made on the Town, and that the Defendants continued &s;till re&s;olute and unterrified, and therefore that &s;ome|thing more effectual &s;hould be attempted upon them, to force them to a Surrender: It was ordered, that four of the greate&s;t Ships &s;hould be appointed to batter the Town with their Cannon, whil&s;t an At|tempt &s;hould be made to burn their Galle|ots, Brigantines, and Londra's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to burn the Ve&s;&s;els of the Town&punc;</NOTE> which were drawn up clo&s;e under the Walls: To exe|cute this Enterprize, four Boats, or Pinna|ces armed with Stout Re&s;olute Seamen, Commanded by <HI>Peter Ferrari,</HI> were ap|pointed to burn the Ve&s;&s;els lying under the Walls, and being furni&s;hed with Fireworks, were to make an Attack on them, under the Smoak of the Cannon, which were to play on the Town from the four Ships.</P>

<P>Things not being very promi&s;ing before <HI>Malva&s;ia,</HI> and little hopes to &s;ubdue it by force, the Doge re&s;olved to &s;pend the re|mainder of the Summer in crui&s;ing in the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> but not to lo&s;e all the Fruits of the preceding Labours, the Redoubt rai&s;ed at the Bridge was fortified and perfected, and the other Forts &s;trengthned with as ma|ny Men and Cannon, as were e&s;teemed &s;ufficient both to keep the Enemy from Sallying out, or Provi&s;ions from entring in; but before the Doge departed, four of the greate&s;t Ships were ordered to batter the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ships batter the Town.</NOTE> and give a farewell to them with their bigge&s;t Cannon: The which being performed within Musket-&s;hot, ruined al|mo&s;t all the Suburbs, yet not without &s;ome Lo&s;s aboard the Ships by the Enemies Small-&s;hot from the Walls.</P>

<P>All things being thus ordained, and a|greed, the Doge weighed Anchor in the Night, and endeavoured to get out, but the Winds being contrary, he was forced to return back again to an Anchor; as the like happened al&s;o the next Day, not only by contrary Winds, but by &s;ome Mi&s;under|&s;tandings between the Ve&s;&s;els of the Van-Guard.

<P>The Sea&s;on of the Year being now far advanced towards the Summer, and things preparing for greater Action; the <HI>German</HI> Officers were very intent, and &s;tudious in what manner to con&s;erve <HI>Ni&s;&s;a;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> for which they had great rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive, for that according to the Reports of all tho&s;e who lately came from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and of &s;uch De&s;erters who came out from the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Quarters;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ni&s;&s;a <HI>pro|vided.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Turks</HI> were become much more numerous than the la&s;t Year, and were marching on purpo&s;e to make <HI>Ni&s;&s;a</HI> the fir&s;t Atchievement and De&s;ign of

<P>About this time a &s;mall &s;ort of Venomous Flies &s;warmed about <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> which killed ma|ny Hor&s;es, Cattle, Camels, and Mules.

Where&s;oever they fixed on the Sides of a Hor&s;e, or any other Part, they would draw a Bli&s;ter as big as an Egg; and entering into the No|&s;trils, immediately poi&s;oned the Brain, which cau&s;ed a &s;udden Death to the Bea&s;t; but hereof I have di&s;cour&s;ed more at large in a former Hi&s;tory, to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>Tho' the great Armies were not as yet in the Field, yet Parties were roving in all Parts and Places, the Weather becoming moderate according to the Sea&s;on, and the Gra&s;s grown; the <HI>Turks</HI> encamped near <HI>Gradi&s;ca,</HI> where they &s;taid a while in ex|pectation of &s;ome Troops to joyn with them, and therewith to pa&s;s the <HI>Save</HI> into <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> with no other De&s;ign than to ruine and &s;poil the Country; but Baron <HI>Koni&s;eck</HI> having Advice thereof, marched from <HI>Brod,</HI> with all the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> and <HI>Heydukes</HI> which were Quartered in the adjacent Villages un|to a Place where the River is fordable, and therefore the mo&s;t likely place where they might de&s;ign to pa&s;s; by which not only the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Turks</HI> was ob&s;tructed, but News coming to them that the <HI>Croats</HI> were fallen in|to their Country on the other &s;ide, they quit|ted their fir&s;t De&s;ign, and marched to oppo&s;e the <HI>Croats,</HI> who were too quick for them, ha|ving taken great Booty, and committed a va&s;t Spoil before the <HI>Turks</HI> could come in to the Succour of their Country.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time one <HI>Herlniovich,</HI> a <HI>Dalmatian</HI> Captain, marched &s;ix Days Jour|ney beyond <HI>Ni&s;&s;a</HI> into the Enemies Coun|try, which he Surprized and Plundered, and returned back with the Heads of &s;everal <HI>Turks,</HI> and &s;ome Pri&s;oners.

<P>In like manner a Captain of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Pyroth</HI> roving abroad, and &s;eeking his Fortune, met near to <HI>Sophia</HI> with 20 Hor|&s;es laden with Nails, Iron, and &s;everal Warlike In&s;truments, he &s;eized them all, and killed 19 <HI>Turks,</HI> and took one Pri&s;oner alive, who in the Night making his E&s;cape, gave Intelligence thereof to <HI>Sophia,</HI> from whence a Party being commanded out, they overtook the <HI>Germans,</HI> and fought with them, but the <HI>Germans</HI> behaved them&s;elves &s;o well, that they forced the <HI>Turks</HI> to leave them, and &s;uffer them to e&s;cape with the Booty they had gained.</P>
<P>At this time al&s;o &s;ome Sea Robbers land|ed in the Bay of <HI>Vola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea Rob|bers Land.</NOTE> and made an Incur|&s;ion into the Territories of <HI>Macedonia</HI> near <HI>Mona&s;&s;ir,</HI> burning and &s;poiling all the Coun|try; whil&s;t another Party of them, to the number of about 600 Men, made a Sal|ly towards <HI>Stippo,</HI> where they &s;urprized 500 <HI>Turks,</HI> and put them all to the Sword, with|out Quarter given to any one; but the In|habitants they carried away Pri&s;oners, and made u&s;e of them for Slaves in the Hills and Mountains.</P>
<P>Nor were things more quiet in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes happened to the Lo&s;s and Damage of the <HI>Turks;</HI> and parti|cularly the Soldiers of the Garri&s;on, and tho&s;e of the Blockade had an Encounter, and the latter returned Victorious, with 16 Pri&s;oners, 22 Heads, 49 Hor&s;es, and &s;ome Cattle.</P>

<P>By the many Troops of <HI>Tartars</HI> which were already entred into <HI>Valachia,</HI> and by the Increa&s;e of <HI>Tekeli</HI>'s Forces, which were become much more numerous and formida|ble, by the Sums of Money which he had received from <HI>France,</HI> the Imperial Gene|rals were greatly alarm'd, and fearing lea&s;t they &s;hould Invade that Country, all the Forces in and about <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> were or|dered to march under the Command of Ge|neral <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> towards the Pa&s;&s;es which lead to <HI>Walachia;</HI> and as they marched, to &s;poil the Ways, and render them as impractica|ble, and difficult as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>By this time News was come to <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> that a great Body of <HI>Turks</HI> was a&s;&s;embled near <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and that the Grand Vizier was actually on his March to joyn with them; whereupon General <HI>Veterani,</HI> ha|ving provided the Garri&s;ons with nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions and Ammunition drew all the Troops he was able unto <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> where he remained at a Gaze to ob&s;erve the Motions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and to afford his A&s;&s;i&s;tance unto any Place which &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or in danger.</P>

<P>Some few Days after which the <HI>Tartars</HI> appeared before <HI>Widin</HI> with their four Gal|lies, and about 60 Ve&s;&s;els, on which 5000 Men were Embarked, and immediately be|gan to fire on the Town; the which News being brought to General <HI>Trautman&s;dorf,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> retire from <HI>Wi|din.</HI></NOTE> he marched immediately with the Troops un|der his Command, to the Relief of the Place, and was followed by &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els laden with Provi&s;ions, Convoyed by Boats armed with Mu&s;queteers; which coming in &s;ight of the <HI>Turks,</HI> they fired ince&s;&s;antly upon them, until &s;uch time as the Cannon planted by <HI>Trautman&s;dorf,</HI> on the &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> forced them to quit their Station, and retire farther down the Stream, to the other &s;ide of the River; after which, the General having provided the Town with a &s;ufficient Garri&s;on, and all &s;orts of Provi&s;i|ons nece&s;&s;ary, conducted the Ve&s;&s;els &s;afely back, and marched farther towards the ge|neral Rendezvous at <HI>Jagodina.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>German</HI> Army being thus entered into <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> many of the Nobility of that Country applied them&s;elves to the Prince for Safe-Conducts, or Protections, to live quietly and to &s;ave their Goods; whil&s;t in the mean time, the <HI>Ra&s;cians</HI> were entered into <HI>Walachia,</HI> where they plun|dered, burned, and put all to the Sword with as much Cruelty as enraged Men can exerci&s;e one again&s;t the other.

<HEAD>THE Venetian Succe&s;&s;es In Their WAR again&s;t the TURKS, In the Year 1690.</HEAD>
<P> <MILESTONE N="1690"> WE concluded the <HI>Venetian</HI> Suc|ce&s;&s;es of the la&s;t Year's Ex|pedition, with the Trium|phant, and Glorious Entry of that Illu&s;trious Prince <HI>Franci&s;co Moro&s;ini</HI> Cavalier, Captain General, and Elected Doge of <HI>Venice,</HI> to whom his Country te|&s;tified as much Honour and Glory as could be contrived and expre&s;&s;ed; the Particulars of which are long and not nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;erted in this Hi&s;tory; only it may not be improper to recount in &s;hort &s;ome of the Exploits of this Great Man, with that Ap|plau&s;e which is due unto his Memory.</P>
<P>This <HI>Franci&s;co Moro&s;ini</HI> de&s;cending from the mo&s;t Ancient Patrician Family in <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> was Born in the Year 1618. He was in his Infancy dedicared by his Parents to the Service of his Country, and educated in all Martial Exerci&s;es; and ri&s;ing by degrees and &s;teps to &s;everal Offices, both Military and Civil, he at length arrived at the Su|pream degree of Government in that Repub|lick, being elected Doge during the time that he was fighting abroad in defence of his Country, he was at fir&s;t made a Noble Commander of a Gally, which is the fir&s;t &s;tep and degree which a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> takes, then he was made a Vice-Admiral and Governour of a Gallea&s;s; next Cap|tain of the Golf, Proveditor-General of the Arms in <HI>Candia,</HI> and then Captain General, in which Office he continued a long time until the Year 1661, behaving him&s;elf with incomparable Valour; in which Year he fought a Battle with the Gallies of <HI>Barbary,</HI> under the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Valona,</HI> he took a great Ship called a Sultana, richly laden from <HI>Egypt,</HI> near the I&s;land of <HI>Milo,</HI> he defended the Breaches of <HI>Candia,</HI> and took another great Sultana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The At|chiev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|ments of <HI>Franci&s;co Moro&s;ini.</HI></NOTE> the Captain of which was called Admiral <HI>Nicolo</HI> of <HI>Nadalin Fur|lano,</HI> and made him Pri&s;oner; he laid the Captain Pa&s;ha's Gally Aboard, and almo&s;t entirely ruined it; he took the Gally of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> together with the &s;e|veral Fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Calamo, Egena, Volo</HI> and <HI>Megara;</HI> and having made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Seas, he de&s;troyed 13 Galleots under the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Preve&s;a.</HI> He made many Sallies from <HI>Candia</HI> in the Face of the Enemy, de&s;troying many of their Works and Intrenchments; he &s;ubdued the For|tre&s;s of <HI>Calamata,</HI> and made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of two <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gallies commanded by <HI>Hali</HI> Pa&s;ha; he al&s;o took the Fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Toron, Chi&s;me, Ca&s;tel-rugio,</HI> and <HI>Schiato,</HI> putting them and other I&s;lands under Contribution.

<P>In fine, after all the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es and Tri|umphs, being returned to <HI>Venice,</HI> he was made Proveditor of <HI>Friuli</HI> to oppo&s;e the In|cur&s;ions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who at that time threatned tho&s;e Countries very much; but tho&s;e Fears being blown over, he was &s;ent back a &s;econd time to Command both the Seas, and me City of <HI>Candia,</HI> then &s;treight|ly Be&s;ieged by the Grand Vizier <HI>Kupriogli,</HI> with the main force of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; the which Siege having continued for the &s;pace of almo&s;t three Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prai&s;es of <HI>Moro|&s;ini.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Turks</HI> were concluded to have lo&s;t 128000 Men before it.

<P>The Inhabitants tired with the long Blockade of 16 Months, and fearing now a forcible A&s;&s;ault, after &s;ome Con&s;ultation held among&s;t them&s;elves, they re&s;olved to deliver up the City, and returned the &s;ame Me&s;&s;engers with the&s;e more rea&s;onable Con|ditions.</P>

<P>In his Jovial Humours he would &s;ome|times make Vi&s;its to the Di&s;con&s;olate <HI>Ma|homet</HI> his Brother, &s;inging and playing be|fore him with his In&s;truments, bidding him be Merry, and telling him that he &s;hould not lament his Fortune. <HI>I have been</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>a Pri&s;oner for</HI> 40 <HI>Years, during which time you were Sultan, and did what you plea|&s;ed; now my time is come, and yours may return:</HI> And then he would take his In&s;tru|ments and play, and &s;ing; &s;aying, <HI>Brother you have let me live, and &s;o &s;hall you, and be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rry:</HI> And in this good Humour he would often pa&s;s his time, to the great comfort of his Depo&s;ed Brother.</P>

<P>It is the Cu&s;tom in the World, that when a Prince comes fir&s;t unto the Throne, for the People to be inqui&s;itive concerning his Humour, Temper, and Abilities for the weight of Government.</P>
<P>The Character of this Sultan <HI>Achmet</HI> be|ing now the common Di&s;cour&s;e, he was re|pre&s;ented to be much more lively, brisk, and quicker of Apprehen&s;ion than his Bro|ther and Predece&s;&s;our Sultan <HI>Solyman,</HI> who (as we have &s;aid) was as dull and as heavy as an Oxe; a weak, &s;imple Man, more fit to be a Dervis than an Emperor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha|racter of Sultan <HI>Achmet.</HI></NOTE> but this <HI>Achmet</HI> was &s;aid to delight to ride on Hor&s;e|back, and to throw the Gerit, a Sport u&s;ed by the Cavaliers, and mettled Sparks and Soldiers among&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI> Farther, he was &s;aid to love Ju&s;tice, and to be rigorous in the execution thereof; an Enemy to Ty|ranny, and Oppre&s;&s;ors of his People; but a great Admirer of the Fair Sex; which Qualities were thought very laudable, and for them, whether true, or fal&s;e, he was had in high e&s;teem with the People; and particularly becau&s;e he was entered into the Project of Coyning Silver Money, and de|ba&s;ing the Copper to half the value of what it lately pa&s;&s;ed for in ordinary Pay|ments.</P>
<P>But the important Affair of all was the Succe&s;s of a Battle, which the Grand Vizier re&s;olved to adventure, both in confidence of the &s;trength of his Army, and his nume|rous Troops, which now were &s;aid to a|mount unto 87226, Hor&s;e and Foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The force of the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Army.</NOTE> as they were counted by faithful Per&s;ons, whom the Grand Vizier had appointed to tell them, as they pa&s;&s;ed the Bridges over the Save; be&s;ides 3000 Seamen, and &s;ome Spahees from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which lagged behind, and the Rabble which attend Armies.</P>
<P>This great Force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor per|&s;wades to a Battle.</NOTE> with the encourage|ment which the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador gave the Grand Vizier to put the Di&s;pute to the Deci&s;ion of a Battle, promi&s;ing him un|doubted Victory, prevailed very much with the Vizier, who con&s;idering the Applicati|ons which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dors made for a Peace, was an Argument both to him and all the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officers, that the Emperor was in a dangerous condition, and unable to maintain the War: How&s;oe|ver when the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was in&s;til|ing this Con&s;ideration into the Mind of the Chimacham at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and that as his Ma&s;ter had already brought great Ruine and De&s;truction into the Dominions of the Emperor, &s;o he would a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport the Grand Seignior in his Wars both with Men and Money. To which the Caimacham made this An&s;wer. <HI>That if it were true, what the Amba&s;&s;ador alledged, the Imperial|i&s;ts could not be in &s;uch a condition as at pre|&s;ent to come down upon the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Armies, and be able to overmatch them both in Num|bers and Valour: What diver&s;ion then</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>hath he given to the Power of the Em|peror?

<P>The two Armies being now very near to each other, Parties were daily detached on both &s;ides to make Di&s;coveries, and bring Intelligence; one of which from Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> on the 8th of this Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skirmi&s;hes in Parties.</NOTE> had an Encounter with &s;ome advanced Guards of the <HI>Turks</HI> near <HI>Semblin,</HI> which upon appear|ance of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> immediately retreat|ed; and a Fog covering the whole <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Camp on a &s;udden, that Party returned without being able to give other Informa|tions.</P>
<P>In like manner the Grand Vizier on the 10th of this Month, came in Per&s;on with all his Hor&s;e to take a view of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Camp; upon which the whole Army was drawn out into Battalia; and &s;ome Volun|teers, and other Troops, advanced &s;o far on the <HI>Turks,</HI> that being attacked by great Numbers of them, they were repul&s;ed, and droven back with &s;ome lo&s;s, until the left Wing of the Army (in which Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> was in Per&s;on) came in to their Suc|cour; how&s;oever 20 of them were killed, and the re&s;t were pur&s;ued to the very Camp; but in revenge the <HI>Turks</HI> were al&s;o beaten back, &s;everal of them being killed in their Retreat.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day the Imperial Army advan|ced two Leagues farther towards <HI>Semblin,</HI> where they po&s;ted them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, that the <HI>Danube</HI> was on their Backs, and the left Wing guarded with <HI>Chevaux de Frize,</HI> which are a kind of Turn-pikes to keep off the Hor&s;e from breaking into the Foot.</P>

<P>On the 13th, whil&s;t the Army re&s;ted, a certain Page to the Major of the Regiment of <HI>Piccolomini,</HI> who had been taken Pri&s;o|ner formerly by the <HI>Turks,</HI> made his E&s;cape, and informed Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> had certainly made an Attack on the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Army, had they not been di&s;&s;waded by the <HI>French,</HI> who advi&s;ed them not to lo&s;e the advantage of their Trenches, but to re|main in them in expectation of being a&s;|&s;aulted therein by the Enemy, or at lea&s;t until they could draw out into a more ad|vantageous Ground, or until the arrival of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which were hourly expect|ed.</P>
<P>During this time the Officers and Soldi|ers of the Imperial Army, kept them&s;elves in a readine&s;s to receive the Enemy; not &s;tripping them&s;elves of their Cloaths, for &s;everal Nights.</P>
<P>That Evening it was concluded at a Council of War, not to engage the Enemy on that Ground, but to return back to <HI>Sa|lankement,</HI> becau&s;e that there being a nece&s;|&s;ity to bring all the Provi&s;ion from thence for the Army; the Convoys could not ea&s;i|ly be defended from the Enemies Hor&s;e, which in great and &s;trong Parties lay in con|tinual wait for them: So that on the 14th in the Morning, by Break of Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr. <HI>Lewis</HI> marches back to <HI>Sa|lanke|ment.</HI></NOTE> the Trumpets and Drums were ordered to give warning to the Army to prepare for a March, the Baggage being &s;ent before, and in the mean time, until nine a Clock in the Morning, the Army &s;tood in view of the Enemy, who moved not out of their Tren|ches, &s;ending only a Party of <HI>Tekeli</HI>'s Men to ob&s;erve their motion.</P>
<P>On the 15th the Army lay &s;till, and &s;o did the <HI>Turks;</HI> and the next Day Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> marched an Hour nearer towards <HI>Sa|lankement:</HI> And on the 17th proceeding one Hour farther, the <HI>Turks</HI> imagined that this Motion was a Flight, little thinking that it was only in de&s;ign to Encamp about <HI>Salan|kement,</HI> where they remained near to their Ships laden with Provi&s;ions, and where they could choo&s;e the mo&s;t advantageous Ground for a Battle. The <HI>Turks</HI> encouraged with this Imagination, marched after the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Army, and fell in the Rear of them with &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Hor&s;e; but Count <HI>Stirum</HI> General, and Count <HI>Hoffkir|ken</HI> Major-General of the Hor&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> repul&s;ed.</NOTE> charged them &s;o briskly, be&s;towing &s;ome Shot a|mong&s;t them from their Field-Pieces, as cau&s;ed them to retire with lo&s;s, and to re|main more quiet for a while. How&s;oever a|bout Midnight a great Number of the Ene|mies Hor&s;e, Camels, and Mules, having been &s;tung by a &s;ort of Venomous Fly, had broke their Halters and Bridles, and with their Sadles, and Harne&s;&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">arm given.</NOTE> came run|ning into the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Camp, which gave an Alarm to the whole Army: But that be|ing over, it was expected, that the next Day a Battle would en&s;ue, which both the Imperial Officers, and Soldiers, did hearti|ly de&s;ire.

<P>This great Lo&s;s was very &s;en&s;ible to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who having lo&s;t all their Provi&s;i|ons, without hopes of any other Supply, found no other Deliverance and Safety, but in their Arms, and &s;o re&s;olved on a Battle: The <HI>Turks</HI> on the other &s;ide growing Ar|rogant, and bold on the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, began now to contemn their Enemies, and to look only on them as &s;o many lo&s;t Men, whom they now condemned, and &s;entenced to De&s;truction, re&s;olving to give them no Quarter in the Field.</P>

<P>In this memorable Battle, which was the mo&s;t Bloody of any that hath happened in &s;everal Ages, the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t in all upwards of 25000 Men, and among&s;t them the Grand Vizier; what Officers were killed on both &s;ides, or wounded, appears in the following Li&s;t. The <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet, bringing their Ve&s;|&s;els clo&s;e to the Shoar, and as near as they
<PB N="405" REF="225"> could to their Army, landed 5000 Men out of it, which might have turned the Bal|lance, had they come timely in unto the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Brethren;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> land <HI>5000</HI> Men out of their Fleet.</NOTE> but finding the whole Army in Confu&s;ion, and all the Field in di&s;order, they retired with much Precipitation Aboard their Fleet.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe all the Circum&s;tances, Turns, Changes, Pa&s;&s;ages, and Chances of this Battle, which was fought on both &s;ides with admirable Re&s;o|lution and Courage; for which tho&s;e of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army who were &s;lain, de&s;erve for ever to be Chronicled in Hi&s;tory; and tho&s;e who &s;urvive, are worthy of a la&s;ting Fame, and Immortal Glory.</P>
<P>Much is owing by all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> to the Valour and Conduct of that Noble Gene|ral Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> as al&s;o to the Mar&s;hal-General Count of <HI>Dunewaldt,</HI> to Count <HI>Souches,</HI> General of the Artillery; to Count <HI>Stirum,</HI> General of the Hor&s;e; and to Lieutenant-General <HI>Barfus</HI> of the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> Troops, be&s;ides all the Ser|geants, Generals, and Officers, who beha|ved them&s;elves with that Bravery, Con|duct, and Zeal in the Cau&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> and of the Empire, that they merit to be mentioned with all Honour and Re|&s;pect, when&s;oever this Battle comes to be recounted in the&s;e pre&s;ent Days, or in fu|ture Ages: And &s;o bloody was this Battle, that the <HI>French</HI> King, to comfort the <HI>Turks,</HI> ordered his Amba&s;&s;ador to tell them, That &s;uch another Victory would ruine the Em|peror.</P>
<P>After the Battle the Imperiali&s;ts became Ma&s;ters of all the Enemies Artillery; namely, 154 Pieces of Cannon of all &s;orts, great and &s;mall, great Numbers of En&s;igns and Colours; and among&s;t the re&s;t of the Standard of the Grand Vizier, with tho&s;e of the Pa&s;ha's, and of the whole Spoil and Plunder of the Field, with all the Camels, and Mules, and Bea&s;ts of Burden belong|ing to the Camp, which among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> are va&s;tly numerous: Al&s;o 10000 Tents, 10 Waggons laden with Copper Money, found in the Vizier's Tent; in the Trea&s;urer's 54 Trunks of Copper, and 12 with Silver, and 24 Che&s;ts of Kaftans. Moreover all the Standards and Colours belonging to the Regiment of <HI>Bucquoy,</HI> ta|ken the Day before by the <HI>Turks;</HI> 24 En|&s;igns, and four Hor&s;e-Tails were &s;ent to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and among&s;t them the Grand Vi|zier's Standard, which the Emperor &s;ent to the Pope.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s the <HI>Turks</HI> have had in this Acti|on, appears irreparable; for about 10 or 12000 of their be&s;t Di&s;ciplined, and <HI>Vete|rane</HI> Jani&s;aries being killed, they have not as yet been recovered to this very Year of 1694; the which is evident, for of all the Army they could make in that Year of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> with Thou&s;ands of raw, and ill compo&s;ed Troops, con&s;i&s;ting of Plow-Men, and Cow-Boys, they could not make up an Army of 50000 Men; which indeed is wonderful, and &s;hows the &s;trange Cata&s;trophies of this un&s;table World; and de&s;erves our &s;erious Contem|plation of the Uncertainty of Humane Af|fairs? For whereas the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which hath been famed in pa&s;t Ages for Multitudes and Swarms of Men, by which, over-powering their Enemies by Num|bers, rather than by Valour, made all their Conque&s;t from <HI>Ba&s;ora,</HI> as far as <HI>Buda,</HI> are now dwindled to a Condition, which many of our &s;maller Princes in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> are able to equal.</P>
<P>All which we are to attribute to the Al|mighty Hand of God, who commi&s;erating the wretched E&s;tate of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> at a time when the Victorious Arms of <HI>France</HI> were employed in ruining and laying wa&s;te one end of it, the <HI>Turks</HI> had Invaded the other, and threatned an entire De&s;olation of all <HI>Germany.</HI></P>

<P><HI>AMET</HI> Pa&s;&s; of <HI>Dierbekir,</HI> and Se|raskier in the&s;e Parts of the <HI>Save,</HI> has de&s;ired me for the Com|mon Good of the Poor <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> here|abouts &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ed, to write to your Excellency, and interpo&s;e in their behalf the good Offices of His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> my Ma&s;ter; which I the more readily perform, as being pur|&s;uant to the Orders of my King (equal|ly a Friend to both Empires) to con|tribute all po&s;&s;ible Means, and apply my be&s;t Endeavours to the removing the pernicious Effects of this &s;o long and Bloody a War, and changing it into an ho|nourable la&s;ting Peace.</P>
<P>Your Excellency may be &s;en&s;ible, that be&s;ides the Obligations of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Cha|rity, 'tis my Intere&s;t al&s;o to corre&s;pond and cheri&s;h (by good Offices) that Con|fidence and E&s;teem which they here ex|pre&s;s for the King my Ma&s;ter, and there|fore I doubt not but your Excellency will comply herewith, as far as is in your Power, and likewi&s;e &s;ollicit the Court for more ample and po&s;itive Orders, to which Charitable Work my Lord <HI>Pagett</HI> (His Maje&s;ty's Envoy Extraordinary at <HI>Vienna</HI>) will (I am &s;ure) be earne&s;tly a&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>I intreat your Excellency al&s;o to &s;end this Original by a Staffettee to his Lord|&s;hip, that he may under&s;tand how well I have been received here, and give an Account thereof to the King my Ma|&s;ter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I entred into the States of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, I was met by the Beg, or Commandant of every Place, attended by the Militia, who furni&s;hed me with all Nece&s;&s;aries both for my Journey and Sub&s;i&s;tence: At <HI>Peter Wa|radin</HI> I was Complemented by an Aga, &s;ent from the Seraskier; and at the Mouth of the <HI>They&s;&s;e,</HI> was met by many Barks, guarded by <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who con|ducted me to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> where I was pre|&s;ently Complemented by the principal Officers of the Seraskier's Court, who &s;ent his own Hor&s;es to convey me and my Family to the Tents, which were pitch'd on the Shoar, and appointed to receive me.</P>
<P>The next Day I was received by the Seraskier in full Divan, compo&s;ed of all the Principal Officers both Civil and Mi|litary; where when I had given Thanks for the Honours received, the Pa&s;&s;a an|&s;wered me, That &s;uch were the Ancient Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which they were re&s;olved to ob&s;erve, and aboli&s;h the Abu&s;es introduced by the late Grand Seignior, and his Prime Vizier <HI>Mu&s;tapha.</HI> Then the Seraskier, with much earne&s;t|ne&s;s, did exaggerate the Unju&s;t Oppre&s;&s;i|on which was practi&s;ed by <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to tho&s;e of the &s;ame Faith, who Inhabited the Country called <HI>Syrmium,</HI> &s;ituate be|tween the <HI>Drave, Save,</HI> and <HI>Danube,</HI> who were barbarou&s;ly &s;poil'd of their Cloaths, robb'd of their Cattle, and o|bliged to pay exce&s;&s;ive Impo&s;itions again&s;t all Laws of Humanity and a regulated Government; whereas on the contrary, their Sultan &s;ent Money to be di&s;tributed among the Poor Subjects, to buy them Cattle and Seed, thereby &s;hewing him&s;elf a Father of the Mi&s;erable, and not a Ty|rant; and this Charity (continued he) which ought to be natural to you <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> towards one another, need not hinder the Ho&s;tility of Soldiers when they meet and encounter, leaving the poor Coun|try-Men in Peace, who labour only for the Publick Good, and the Service of that Prince whom God &s;hall place over them. I an&s;wered with applauding &s;uch Pious Maxims, and that I hoped &s;o good Di&s;po|&s;itions would incline them more favoura|bly to hearken to what I was to propo&s;e in the Name of my King, towards the ending this Bloody War between the two Empires; and that as to the Particulars he mentioned, I being a Stranger knew nothing of them. He then proceeded to charge Count <HI>Chizzaola</HI> (Commandant of <HI>E&s;&s;eck</HI>) to have deceived him on &s;everal Occa&s;ions after his Word given; a Crime (&s;ays he) which will be puni&s;hed by God; and if the Charity of my Emperor to|wards
<PB N="410" REF="228"> the Poor Subjects and Country|men had not re&s;trained me, what wou'd have hindred me this Winter to have made Excur&s;ions even to <HI>Buda?</HI> But all I &s;hou'd have gained, wou'd have been only the Tears and Cur&s;es of the Mi&s;erable: I an|&s;wer'd with commending the generous Clemency and Mercy of the pre&s;ent Go|vernment; and our Conference ended with the u&s;ual Ceremonies of Coffee, Sherbet, and Perfumes.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon I was call'd for by the Seraskier to a Private Audience, at which only his Effendi, and my Secretary (who was in&s;tead of an Interpreter) were pre|&s;ent: I repre&s;ented to him, that this peril|lous Journey I had undertaken, and by a way &s;o unu&s;ual to Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> was a Mark of the high Friend&s;hip and Affection which the King my Ma&s;ter bore to the two Empires of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> who re&s;enting &s;en&s;ibly the fatal Con&s;equences of &s;o long and bloody a War, commanded me to pa&s;s by <HI>Vienna,</HI> there to receive the Orders and In&s;tructi|ons of the Emperor of the <HI>Romans,</HI> towards the amicable ending of it, to which good Work &s;hou'd not the Grand Sultan and His Mini&s;ters likewi&s;e corre&s;pond, it might be ju&s;tly feared, that the Mi&s;chiefs and De|&s;olations hereafter en&s;uing, wou'd call down Vengeance from God upon the Mu&s;|&s;elmen. The Seraskier applauding the King's Generous De&s;ign, took notice that there never yet was between <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, either War or a|ny alienation of Affection, but always perfect Friend&s;hip, which he beg'd God wou'd continue: He commended the Wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent Vizier, his Huma|nity and Treatablene&s;s, and approved my Solicitous Earne&s;tne&s;s to continue my Voyage, leaving it to my Choice, either to go by Land or Water. I told him, I re&s;olved to go by Water as far as <HI>Ru&s;giuk,</HI> a Days Journey below <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> and to Travel thence by Land: He again re|new'd the Complaints made in the Divan, in behalf of the Poor Inhabitants of <HI>Syr|mium,</HI> and pre&s;s'd me to Write to your Excellency to forbid the Plundering of Villages, and Excur&s;ions of the <HI>Heydukes,</HI> who behave them&s;elves more like Thieves than Soldiers; and that your Excellency wou'd order, that they who are Peaceable and Di&s;arm'd, may continue not only in Repo&s;e, but al&s;o be protected to the Be|nefit of that Prince to whom God &s;hall give the Government. He a&s;&s;ured me fur|ther, That what&s;oever Expedient &s;hall be propo&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts, towards the preventing &s;uch Violences, he will readily agree to, and cau&s;e it to be rigorou&s;ly ob|&s;erved; and in this &s;o <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> a Cau&s;e, intreated me to interpo&s;e the good Offices of my King. I do therefore be&s;eech your Excellency to Corre&s;pond herein with <HI>A|met</HI> Pa&s;&s;a, either by Letter, or by Depu|ties on both &s;ides, to meet on the Con|fines, and to be plea&s;ed to inform me of your Re&s;olution herein, by an open Let|ter &s;ent to the Seraskier, with whom I al|&s;o leave a Copy of this, as I will like|wi&s;e do with the Grand Vizier, not de|&s;igning to expo&s;e the Confidence they have in my King to the Hazards of any Acci|dents which might prove equally prejudi|cial to both Empires.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity to &s;hew my &s;elf equally Charitable towards the Poor <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> taken in <HI>Or&s;oua,</HI> and made Slaves (as was reported) after they had Capitu|lated to have &s;afe Conduct into the Empe|ror's Territories. I was an&s;wer'd, That they had Surrendred them&s;elves with con|dition, That if <HI>Belgrade</HI> were lo&s;t, they would be Pri&s;oners of War, and that the Grand Vizier was not capable of violating the Publick Faith &s;o &s;hamefully. I de|manded concerning &s;ome other Pri&s;oners, recommended to me by their Friends; but was an&s;wer'd, That they were all the Grand Seignior's Captives, and without his expre&s;s Order they could not treat ei|ther for their Ran&s;om or Exchange: He told me, That all Officers were well trea|ted, and kept without Irons in a Chamber apart, with their Servants, at the Expence of the Grand Seignior. I left 100 Ducats of Gold to be di&s;tributed by Capt. <HI>Runkel,</HI> to the Poore&s;t of them, which was all the Service I could do them, and of which I in|treat your Excellency to give their Friends an Account.</P>
<P>A Courier being di&s;patched to <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> I have had Permi&s;&s;ion to Write to the Grand Vizier, and Sir <HI>William Trum|bal,</HI> giving Information of my Arrival; I purpo&s;e &s;uddenly to continue my Voyage with full intention to do all the Service I can to both Empires, in execution of the Commands of my King, in who&s;e Name I continue to pre&s;s (as de&s;ired) your Excellency, that &s;ome Means may be found out to prevent the Rapines daily practi&s;ed upon the Poor Country People.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed &s;hort Letter for my Lord <HI>Pagett,</HI> I intreat your Excellency wou'd tran&s;mit to him, as al&s;o this Original, that his Lord&s;hip being &s;ufficiently inform|ed, may better know what to &s;ollicite from the Emperor, and what to acquaint the King my Ma&s;ter. I am,</P>

<P>THE Vizier made his Entrance fir&s;t, with no great Train, nor in the Pub|lick Streets, but pa&s;t direct to his Tents; half an Hours di&s;tance, the Grand Seignior enter'd, on the 29th, with a fair &s;hew to us, but to o|thers very &s;hort of former Splendour; he was in a Litter, one of his Court with him at the other end. The Vizier &s;ent his Emeen Chew&s;e, (the 2d in that Office) with eight more, the &s;ame Afternoon he entred, that he being in ha&s;te, de&s;ired me to be ready to come to Audi|ence next Day. We were &s;urprized, becau&s;e our Druggermen in good Manners thinking that Day due to his Repo&s;e, did not de&s;ign to have carried my Complement, and to de&s;ire leave of Audience till next Day; but I &s;ent them immediately to perform my Duty in congratu|lating his Excellency's Arrival, and to concert Matters for next Day, al&s;o to de&s;ire it might be private, in regard I was without Equipage &s;uitable to a Publick Appearance. The Chew&s;e Ba&s;&s;a told the Vizier, in regard I had no great Retinue, his Per&s;onal Attendance might be wav'd, but he commanded him to come in Per|&s;on: Accordingly on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning <HI>June 1/11</HI> about nine a Clock, we &s;et forward in the be&s;t Accoutrements we could: I was in my Em|broider'd Scarlet Coat, &s;ix <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Footmen in my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lac'd Liveries, &s;ix in red Live|ries <HI>al modo Turche&s;co, 18</HI> Chew&s;es in Van, two Druggermen after them, then my &s;elf with the Chew&s;e-Ba&s;&s;a on my right Hand, and about <HI>10</HI> Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback following me, &s;ome of my own Company, others that came from <HI>Belgrade</HI> with me, and &s;everal other <HI>Turks,</HI> that we made a large Train, and drew Crouds of Spectators. In half an Hour we arrived at his Camp; conducted into his Tents, we pa&s;t one very large one, and through that into a|nother; his Officers were all drawn in Lines; they brought me a Stool to &s;it on, and imme|diately the Vizier enter'd, &s;at down upon a Bed carpeted; his People made a Prayer at his En|trance; he bid me welcome, and I acquainted him with my Commi&s;&s;ion, delivering him the King's Letter and its Tran&s;lation; after this was over, the Tent full of Officers, and his two Sons &s;tanding on his right Hand, I ask'd his Excellencies leave now, or when he pleas'd, to &s;peak in private; he told me, after Sherbet, Coffee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Treat, the Company &s;hould retire, and he being in ha&s;te de&s;ired it now, when we di&s;cour&s;ed according to the Re|lation I &s;end inclo&s;ed <HI>Verbatim,</HI> as nigh as we four could remember, and to which we all put our Hands, <HI>viz.</HI> my &s;elf, Senior <HI>Mar&s;igli,</HI> Mr. <HI>Coke</HI> Secretary, and Senior <HI>Antonio Perrone</HI> chief Interpreter; there remained none in the Room but the Vizier, as before men|tioned, and one Druggerman more. At De|parture I was Ve&s;ted and <HI>11</HI> more, all that I had of Quality, and conducted back with &s;ome Re&s;pect. His Excellency was very courteous, and we had all the Marks po&s;&s;ible of a very kind Reception, with as much Honour as any in the Character.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> The Point re&s;olved was, That his Excellency would not own the <HI>Turks</HI> at <HI>Vi|enna</HI> under any Publick Character, would nei|ther write to them, or &s;end any other: When I told him the Emperor had accepted the King of <HI>England</HI> and States of <HI>Holland</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and was well di&s;po&s;ed to a Peace, and if his Excellency did incline al&s;o, I hop'd there
<PB N="412" REF="229"> might be a happy i&s;&s;ue; he reply'd, He was for Peace, but upon Terms of Honour, and if I had Power to treat, would call for Pen. I reply'd, It could not be expected I &s;hould have full Authority before his Excellency's Mind had been known, and that <HI>Vienna</HI> was thought the propere&s;t Place, in regard there had been &s;ome Overtures already made, and Repre&s;enta|tives of all Parties pre&s;ent: That to arrive at an end, there mu&s;t be a beginning; and that, if his Excellency permitted, I would &s;end my Se|cretary to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to per&s;wade His Imperial Maje&s;ty to impower his General, that &s;o his Ex|cellency being now upon departure for the Con|fines, they might treat there; and if his Ex|cellency judged my Per&s;on and Pre&s;ence nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;o ble&s;s'd a Work, I would wait upon his Excellency, and attend his Camp: He told me there was no occa&s;ion I &s;hould take &s;o much trouble; but &s;aid, Send your Secretary to <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> that the Emperor &s;end a Per&s;on accor|ding to cu&s;tom, fully impowred to treat here, or el&s;e that we are as we are: And to this he added two or three Lines: To this there's no Reply.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I &s;poke &s;everal times that the Commi&s;&s;ion was to me and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dor equally; which I did, and now repeat to a|void all Thoughts, becau&s;e the Vizier when he &s;poke, &s;aid, Let the Emperor &s;end his Com|mi&s;&s;ion to me, not naming the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to this no Reply: 'Tis not an Ambition I de&s;ire, nor &s;hall I le&s;s communicate with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, who&s;e Coun&s;el I &s;hall always de|&s;ire.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord,</HI> I am very glad I have the Op|portunity of returning Count <HI>Mar&s;igli,</HI> who will &s;upply by Parole what I may omit, or what is not convenient for a Letter, and that your Lord&s;hip will tran&s;mit it to my Lord <HI>Nottingham:</HI> 'Tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the Emperor re&s;olves that he adju&s;ts the Points with the Allies, or treats without them, which the <HI>Turks</HI> would imbrace greedily; but &s;ince His Imperial Maje&s;ty will not relinqui&s;h them, nor they able to defend, but mu&s;t di&s;gorge, and be &s;wallowed up if alone; 'tis I think ve|ry rea&s;onable that the Emperor requires them to po&s;itive and convenient Conditions. The <HI>Turks</HI> Nature is to do at once, and therefore con&s;idering well there mu&s;t be a Power intru|&s;ted. I &s;hall be very ready to give all the po&s;|&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance I can, and if required, readily pa&s;s to the Camp, or Confines, for obtaining &s;o pious a Work, grateful, and mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h'd by the poor Subjects of both Empires; and I hope I &s;hall have the better fortune for the many hearty Prayers and good Wi&s;hes I have gain'd on both &s;ides. God Almighty pro&s;per and direct you to compleat it. What you &s;end to me, pray let be clear, to avoid Replies, and that Count <HI>Mar&s;igli</HI> may be perfectly in&s;truct|ed, who knowing the po&s;ture and humour of Af|fairs here, will, I hope, expedite their Coun|&s;els, and re&s;olve them. The Juncture &s;eems very favourable, and the Allies, I believe, very pre&s;&s;ing; this Opportunity lo&s;t, God knows the Con&s;equences. Senior <HI>Mar&s;igli</HI> will tell your Lord&s;hip &s;ome things I have charged to his Memory, and de&s;ire your Lord&s;hip to &s;end to my Lord <HI>Nottingham.</HI> My ha&s;te and length of Letters will not permit me to u&s;e Cypher at pre&s;ent: I have pre&s;umed to write to His Imperial Maje&s;ty, and mo&s;t of the Mini&s;ters, to acknowledge my Obligations and readine&s;s in their Intere&s;ts, which I humbly beg of your Lord&s;hip to deliver; and if the Bearer, who goes directly to your Lord&s;hip be pre&s;ent, he can &s;upply all that is deficient.

<P>In the la&s;t Month of <HI>July</HI> we left the two Amba&s;&s;adors Sir <HI>William Hu&s;&s;ey,</HI> and the Heer <HI>Collier</HI> at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where having received the News of the total Defeat of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, with the Death of the Grand Vizier, a &s;top was given to their pre&s;ent Motion towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> with intention to proceed with the New Vizier thither; and there to rea&s;&s;ume the Mediation towards a Peace, for which the pre&s;ent Conjuncture &s;eemed very &s;ea&s;onable.</P>

In like manner the <HI>Turks</HI> were in great Confu&s;ion and Di&s;traction, not knowing which way to turn them&s;elves; &s;ometimes it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the Grand Vizier &s;hould ha&s;ten to <HI>Belgrade</HI> to take the Care and Command of the &s;cattered Troops, which were now at a lo&s;s for want of a <HI>Chief Head,</HI> and a Place whereunto to re&s;ort, and take refuge: Be&s;ides the Pre&s;ence of a Vi|zier was e&s;teemed of great encouragement to the broken Army, and the only means to retard the Flight of tho&s;e who were rea|dy to break up their Camp, and betake them&s;elves to their own Habitations.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Vizier was con&s;ulting hereof News came that the Army at <HI>Belgrade</HI> was all, or for the mo&s;t part di&s;per&s;ed; that the &s;mall Number of the Jani&s;aries which &s;ur|vived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army at <HI>Bel|grade</HI> di&s;|per&s;ed.</NOTE> were re&s;olved not to remain longer at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> but were already on their March towards <HI>Adrianople,</HI> in a Naked and Poor Condition, without Money, or Cloaths.

<P>The Winter drawing near, the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Militia, being under great Di&s;couragements, and having a long Journey Home, thought fit to leave the Camp: So did the <HI>Tartars,</HI> Plundering all in

<P>The Weather beginning now to be Cold and Wet, much incommoded the Soldiers of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> his Army in their March, e&s;pecially the Foot, who tra&s;hing through the Waters in a Country where was no Wood to Dry them, or Warm, and Dre&s;s their Victuals, many of them fell Sick and Died. And indeed that Country, as I have my &s;elf ob&s;erved, hath neither Tim|ber, nor Underwoods; &s;o that the Inhabi|tants live in Caves under Ground, the Soil being of a &s;tiff Clay, grows hard with Fires, like a Stone; all their Fuel being Turf, of which, by the Lazine&s;s of the Inhabitants, a &s;ufficient &s;tore had not been gathered to furni&s;h the pre&s;ent u&s;e of the Army.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Army quartered in this Bar|ren Country, News was brought to Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> That General <HI>Veterani</HI> having heard of the Defeat of the <HI>Turks,</HI> had Decamped from <HI>Dobra,</HI> and was marched to <HI>Lippa;</HI> where coming before the Town, he &s;ent his Summons to Surrender, which being refu&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lippa</HI> &s;ur|rendered to General <HI>Veterani</HI></NOTE> &s;ome few Bombs were ca&s;t into it, which brought the Garri&s;on to a De&s;ire to Capitulate, but nothing would be granted but a Surrender at Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>In fine, all the Men, being 216 in num|ber, were made Pri&s;oners, together with three Pa&s;ha's, <HI>viz.

In the Town were three Guns, and two Mortar-pieces only, with a good quantity of Ammunition, but little of Pro|vi&s;ions. After which Count <HI>Gutten&s;teyn</HI> was made Governour of the Place, with &s;ome Hundreds of Men for a Garri&s;on: And whereas News was brought, That <HI>Te|keli,</HI> with five or 6000 Men was Quarter|ed about <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> it gave &s;ome Appre|hen&s;ions of his De&s;ign to Invade <HI>Tran&s;ilva|nia;</HI> for which rea&s;on General <HI>Veterani</HI> kept his Station at <HI>Lippa</HI> to ob&s;erve his Motions.</P>
<P>In the mean time Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> continued his March to <HI>Segedin,</HI> where he refre&s;hed his Army for &s;ome Days: And here it was that a certain <HI>Turk</HI> came from <HI>Belgrade</HI> un|der a Pretence to demand the Exchange of 4000 <HI>Turks</HI> again&s;t &s;o many <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr. <HI>Lewis</HI> continues his March.</NOTE> but this Propo&s;al &s;eeming fictitious, he was &s;u&s;pected for a Spy, &s;eized, and commit|ted to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>It being thought fit to &s;ecure <HI>Lippa</HI> late|ly taken, the Prince &s;ent his Adjutant-General with 12 Saicks laden with Provi&s;i|ons, and &s;ome Money, by way of the River <HI>Maroth</HI> to <HI>Lippa,</HI> to Mend and Re|pair the Fortifications of that Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reinforces</HI> Lippa.</NOTE> and rai&s;e new ones where the Works were de|fective; and for its better Reinforcement, 2000 <HI>Ra&s;cians,</HI> and <HI>Hungarians,</HI> both Hor&s;e and Foot, were &s;ent to &s;trengthen the Gar|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Prince likewi&s;e with the remaining part of the Army, marched to <HI>Zolnock,</HI> where the Hor&s;e having pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge for that purpo&s;e erected, met on the &s;ame Day of their Arrival, with the Field-Mar|&s;hal Count <HI>Mansfelt,</HI> and Major-General <HI>Aversberg</HI> at the &s;ame place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Party of <HI>Tekeli</HI>'s Men defea|ted.</NOTE> who had late|ly been detached in two Parties; the latter of which had the fortune to &s;urprize a Par|ty of 600 Men belonging to <HI>Tekeli,</HI> of whom they killed above 100, and made 32 Pri&s;oners; which gave &s;o great an A|larm to others of their Companions, which were po&s;ted near <HI>Great Waradin,</HI> that in a precipitate Flight and Confu&s;ion, they be|took them&s;elves to their Heels, carrying withal their Bag and Baggage, with what|&s;oever el&s;e was portable.</P>
<P>Nor was Count <HI>Schlick</HI> who Command|ed the Blockade of <HI>Great Waradin,</HI> le&s;s &s;uc|ce&s;sful; for having received Information, That &s;ome Hundreds of Oxen belonging to that Garri&s;on, were Gra&s;ing in the Mea|dows near thereunto; po&s;ted him&s;elf with 400 Hor&s;e in a &s;mall Wood over again&s;t the Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. <HI>Schlick</HI> defeats a Party from <HI>Gr.

<P>This Succe&s;s was followed by another of the like Nature, for <HI>Schlick</HI> having un|der&s;tood from the Pri&s;oners, that a con&s;ide|rable Body of <HI>Tekeli</HI>'s Men were Quarter|ed in a Village on the other &s;ide of the City; he took the opportunity of the Night to pa&s;s &s;ilently along, and without any Noi&s;e &s;urprize them, and killed mo&s;t of them in their Quarters, after which

<P>It being now divulged that the De&s;ign of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> was to turn the Blockade of <HI>Great Waradin</HI> into a Formal Siege, Count <HI>Aversberg</HI> was Detached from the Army with a Body of Dragoons and Pio|neers, to Mend and Repair the Roads which were become almo&s;t unpa&s;&s;able, e|&s;pecially for Cannon, and Waggons laden with Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries for the Army.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Schlick</HI> who was not as yet privy to this De&s;ign of the Prince, ob&s;erving by his Motion, That <HI>Great Waradin</HI> was to be formally Be&s;ieged, he privately con|veyed him&s;elf and Troops into &s;ome I&s;lands between the Rivers <HI>Koro&s;h</HI> and <HI>Bozze,</HI> and drove away the Enemies Cattle, being a|bout 900 Head, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners from under the very Walls of the City, and brought them all to his Camp.

<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> having other Magazines of Powder and Provi&s;ions remained re&s;olute in their Defence; and on the other &s;ide the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army continued to throw Bombs into the Fortre&s;s, by which a Steeple took fire, which &s;pread it &s;elf through the whole Fortre&s;s, and in le&s;s than &s;ix Hours time one half thereof was reduced to A&s;hes:
<PB N="429" REF="237"> In the mean time a Party of <HI>Tartars</HI> of a|bout 600 fell in upon the Foragers, and took both the Men and Hor&s;es, and Booty which they had by them, but being im|mediately pur&s;ued and overtaken by the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> all was &s;eized again and brought to the Camp with &s;even Heads, and three Pri&s;oners.</P>

<P>On the 2d In&s;tant the throwing of Bombs was continued, and a Great Fort was rai&s;ed for the &s;ecuring of the Po&s;ts if the advanced Sea&s;on of the Year, and the Ob&s;tinacy of the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould oblige the Prince to rai&s;e the Siege, and to leave the City narrowly Blocked up during the Win|ter.</P>
<P>On the 3d the Cannon of the Be&s;iegers beat down a great Tower on which the Be|&s;ieged had &s;everal Guns which much in|commoded the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>

He was an Ancient Man, and of great Experience, but he was neither e&s;teemed for a Wi&s;e, nor an Under|taking Man, which are two Qualities very nece&s;&s;ary in a Grand Vizier. But the Mufti made &s;ome amends for the Inabilities of that Great Mini&s;ter; for being a Per&s;on
<PB N="431" REF="239"> of a deep Under&s;tanding, and highly e|&s;teemed by all Parties for his profound Wi&s;|dom, he became very helpful to the Grand Vizier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Quali|fications.</NOTE> who had the good quality to hear|ken unto the Coun&s;els of tho&s;e who were wi&s;er than him&s;elf; it being one of his In|firmities to be irre&s;olute, which &s;hows an Imbecility of Mind; and is a quality the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to an ab&s;olute Monarchy. But being pu&s;hed forward by his Friends, he governed well; for being a Man not very Avaritious, (as few <HI>Turks</HI> but are) he preferred none but &s;uch as were Men of Merit, and had &s;ignalized them&s;elves by long Services, or &s;ome great or good Acti|ons; his Country was <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> which hath given many Valiant and Stout Soldiers to the <HI>Turks,</HI> being reputed Men of Bravery, and Fidelity in their Words and Acti|ons.</P>
<P>Never had the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, &s;ince it came to be an Empire, more need of Able, Valiant, and Wi&s;e Men, than at pre&s;ent; and never were they more rare and hard to be found: For what with the War which de&s;troyed their brave, and be&s;t of their Gallant Soldiers, and Commanders; and with their Seditions, and Tumults at Home, in which their Principal Officers, both Civil and Military, were cut off; none remained alive but only Up&s;tarts, or &s;ome Leaders of the In&s;olent, or Seditious Soldiery: And this was the State of the Empire, not only oppre&s;&s;ed by the Victo|rious Enemy on the Frontiers; but by a want of all things at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> even to a Famine, which rai&s;ed the Out-cries and Clamours of the People again&s;t the Go|vernment, which being joyned to the A|bu&s;e of Copper-Money, (than which, at that time no other was to be &s;een, or cur|rantly pa&s;&s;ed) di&s;couraged the Country-Men from bringing Provi&s;ions to the Mar|ket, and cau&s;ed the People more earne&s;tly to cry out for a Peace, and exclaim again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> for having now for four Years engaged them in a War the mo&s;t Bloody, the mo&s;t Ruinous, and mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire that was ever known.

The Diffi|culty of this Great Mini&s;ter's Proceedings did not a little trouble the Thoughts of the Amba&s;&s;ador, e&s;pecially when he had under&s;tood that this Chimacam had wrote to the Mufti to per&s;wade to a Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chima|cam of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> my to the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> the League with <HI>France</HI> being apparently de|&s;tructive to the Empire; &s;aying, as it were, <HI>How long &s;hall the&s;e People be a Snare to us?</HI> And hereof the Amba&s;&s;ador was the more apprehen&s;ive when he heard that the Sul|tan was returning to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for his Health; being per&s;waded by the Phy&s;ici|ans, That the Air of that City and the Sea, would be more conducing to his Health, than that of <HI>Adrianople;</HI> by which he fear|ed, that the Chimacam might have the bet|ter opportunity to in&s;till the&s;e Imaginations into the Head of the Grand Seignior, than he could at a di&s;tance.</P>

<P>A Second Propo&s;al was not to con&s;ide much in the Coun&s;els of the <HI>French;</HI> but to con&s;ult the Opinion of the Soldi|ery, whether they were inclinable to a Peace.</P>

<P>To give more life to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Words, the Son-in-Law to <HI>Tekeli</HI> returned from <HI>France,</HI> and in the beginning of this Year arrived at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> whence immedi|ately without any &s;top, or &s;tay, he took Po&s;t for <HI>Adrianople,</HI> being fully freighted with Letters, and Promi&s;es from the <HI>French</HI> King to the Sultan, and pre&s;ents to the Chief Officers of State to per&s;wade them to Continue, and Maintain the War; &s;o that now all Thoughts and Imaginati|ons of a Peace were vani&s;hed, and laid a|&s;ide.</P>
<P>Wherefore in order to a War, a Project was laid by the two Cadileskers, or Chief Ju&s;tices, to rai&s;e both Men and Money by a more ea&s;ie way, and manner, than had formerly been done; for the&s;e being the Chief Ju&s;tices on whom all the other Infe|riour Ju&s;tices of the Empire depended, an Exact and Secret Calculate was made of the true Number of the Spahees, and of the People in the &s;everal Provinces, and Di|&s;tricts through the whole Empire.</P>
<P>This Calculate was &s;ecretly carried to the Vizier, and Mufti, where after it had been very &s;eriou&s;ly debated, it was well approved, as a Means to ea&s;e the Publick Trea&s;ury, by a more equal Tax on all Vil|lages and Towns, according to the Num|ber of the Inhabitants, and hereon a great Foundation was made of rai&s;ing many Thou&s;ands of Men, and much more Mo|ney than the la&s;t Year.</P>

<P>How&s;oever this could not hinder two Princes of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> belonging to <HI>Arabia De&s;erta,</HI> from Robbing, and Infe&s;ting the Countries about <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> who gave a &s;top to all <HI>Mahometan</HI> Pilgrims going to <HI>Mecca,</HI> until they had paid &s;uch Cafar, or Head-Money for their Pa&s;&s;age, as they de|manded,

<P>This Amba&s;&s;ador &s;tayed not more than a Night at <HI>Scutari,</HI> before he pa&s;&s;ed over into <HI>Europe,</HI> and continued his Journey to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where the 2d of the Month of <HI>February,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> he made a Solemn, and a State|ly Entry; he was a Per&s;on of a Comely Stature, of a Chearful Countenance, Pru|dent, and Generous in his Behaviour, which are Qualities greatly taking in all Courts of the World. In his Retinue he had the Sons of &s;everal Princes of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which &s;erved to add unto the Splendour, and Grandeur of his Emba&s;&s;y. He was Lodged, by Command of the Sultan, in that Magnificent Palace of <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> the late Vizier, which was richly Furni&s;hed for him; but there was no great need of any of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Moveables, for he had &s;pread the Rooms with his own Rich Car|pets, and other Coverings, the like of which had never been &s;een in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court. Moreover all the Kettles, and U|ten&s;ils of the Kitchin were all of Silver, to|gether with the Tables, &s;uch as never any Amba&s;&s;ador had before: And for better Adornment of this Noble Palace, there were certain Fountains which &s;pouted Wa|ter as high as the Upper Story of the Hou&s;e.

<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> ha&s;tned the Return of this Amba&s;&s;ador &s;o much as was po&s;&s;ible; how|&s;oever his Departure could not be precipi|tated before the u&s;ual and common time of other Amba&s;&s;adors, to whom it is the Cu|&s;tom to &s;how the Lutf&eacute;, or the &s;olemn man|ner of giving out the Pay to the Jani&s;aries in the Divan, where the Amba&s;&s;ador is Treated with a Dinner at the Vizier's Ta|ble; but this not being to be performed until the 25th of <HI>March,</HI> the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had magnified &s;o much the Grandeur of their Empire to the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> on all Occa&s;i|ons, were in a Bodily Fear, lea&s;t in the mean time &s;ome Unhappy and Di&s;honour|able News &s;hould come from the Frontiers; or that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;hould di&s;cover the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force, who for|merly u&s;ed to boa&s;t of 2 or 300000, could now &s;carce bring an Army of 60000 Men into the Field; how&s;oever the Arrival of this Amba&s;&s;ador did not a little trouble the Minds of &s;ome principal <HI>Turks,</HI> who be|ing affectionate to their Country and Peo|ple, would be very &s;orry to have the Na|kedne&s;s thereof di&s;covered to their In&s;ult|ing Neighbours.</P>

<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf was Cloathed with the mo&s;t Rich Ti&s;&s;ue and Weighty Cloth of Gold that could po&s;&s;ibly be made; On his Head he had a Cap in form and Manner of a Crown, with Seven Feathers, the Handles of which were &s;tudded with Jewels and Precious Stones; the like Ha|bit the Vice-Amba&s;&s;ador wore, being ap|pointed to &s;ucceed in the Emba&s;&s;y, in ca&s;e the fir&s;t &s;hould fail by any Accident; and before him five Hor&s;es were led. Next fol|lowed the Secretary with the Credential Letters in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, which he carried in his Hand lifted up as high as his Head, on which he wore a Turbant Embroidered with Gold, with four Fea|thers. On one &s;ide of the Amba&s;&s;ador rode the Chiaus-Ba&s;hee, and on the other the Vice-Amba&s;&s;ador, and by his &s;ide, the Aga who was returned from <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> the&s;e were immediately followed by two <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> with Beards, well Mounted, and richly Ha|bited, who were the Ma&s;ters of the Hor&s;e, each carrying a Scimetar in the Scabbard richly adorned with Jewels, and carried under the Arm after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion: Next followed the Attendance of 60 Men on Hor&s;e-back, with Beards cut &s;hort after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Fa&s;hion, all well Habited, a|mong&s;t which was not one, who&s;e Beard was not grown, for the Young Youths were left at Home, being Scandalous to &s;how them Abroad.</P>
<P>When the Amba&s;&s;ador and Vice-Amba&s;|&s;ador were come into the Divan, where the Grand Vizier was pre&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> they cau&s;ed them to &s;it down in the Rank with the Vi|ziers of the Bench, among&s;t which the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> was reckoned; but he who carried the Letters &s;tood all the time during the Lutf&eacute;, or Payment of the Soldiers; after which, according to the u|&s;ual Cu&s;tom, they all &s;ate down to Din|ner, where the Grand Vizier was pre&s;ent: After which they were richly Ve&s;ted, but without Sables, and with them 60 others of the Retinue had Ve&s;ts, which is much more than what are given to the Amba&s;&s;a|dors of the Emperor, the Kings of <HI>Eng|land, France,</HI> or <HI>Holland;</HI> to the fir&s;t of which, as I remember, are given 35 Ve&s;ts, and to tho&s;e of the two Kings 22 a piece, and to that of <HI>Holland</HI> 19; by which we may ob&s;erve the Value which the <HI>Turks</HI> put on the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> before tho&s;e of the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Powers.

<P>But for all this ha&s;te which the <HI>Turks</HI> made, the Factions among&s;t them&s;elves retarded their Expeditions, and cau&s;ed every thing to move &s;lowly. We have already given a Character of the Grand Vizier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the Court.</NOTE> as a Man infirm both in Body and Mind, and endued with no other Abilities to con&s;erve him&s;elf, and his Government, be&s;ides a Cruelty na|tural to him, by which he con&s;erved him|&s;elf by the de&s;truction of others; he had, as we have &s;aid, put many of the Chief Officers to Death; and had cau&s;ed the Muf|ti to be di&s;placed and bani&s;hed; he al&s;o proceeded &s;o far, as to take the Ku&s;lir Aga from the daily Service of the Sultan; and in de&s;pight of his great Power in the Sera|glio, to &s;end him into Bani&s;hment: After which there remained but one Per&s;on, of whom he conceived any Fear, or Jealou|&s;ie, and that was the Chimacam of <HI>Adri|anople;</HI> and until he was taken off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Vizier&s;eeks the Life of the Chi|macam.</NOTE> he could conceive no Quiet within his own Brea&s;t, nor could he think him&s;elf &s;ecure after his departure to the War, unle&s;s he fir&s;t &s;aw his Competitor under the &s;ame Fate with his other Enemies, and his Son placed in his Stead and Office: With the&s;e Thoughts this wretched Vizier went bold|ly to the Sultan to demand licen&s;e to give the Fatal Blow to the Chimacam, the which recoiled upon him&s;elf; for he being much in Favour, and in E&s;teem with the Grand Seignior for his Prudence and Dexterity in Affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is rui|ned there|by.</NOTE> and for the Truth which he had always told him: The Sultan no &s;ooner heard him &s;peak again&s;t the Chimacam, but putting him&s;elf into a Violent Pa&s;&s;ion, called immediately for his Band of Black Eunuchs to remove him away out of his Pre&s;ence, and to &s;trangle him as a Faithle&s;s and an Unworthy Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems the Eunuchs, contrary to their Natural Temper, taking Compa&s;&s;ion of an Aged and Decrepid Per&s;on, fell down at the Feet of the Sultan, imploring his Mercy and Commi&s;eration towards an old Servant, who&s;e Years might plead for his Pardon.</P>
<P>The Sultan being a Prince of an Ea&s;ie Temper, hearkened to their Petitions, and cau&s;ing him to be put into an inward Room for a while, &s;ent immediately to call for the Chimacam to come to him; who all Pale and Wan, fearing lea&s;t his Enemy the
<PB N="437" REF="242"> Vizier had prevailed with the Grand Seig|nior again&s;t his Life, came all Trembling, and ca&s;t him&s;elf down at the Feet of the Sultan; but he was &s;oon put out of his Fears, by the comfortable Words of the Grand Seignior, declaring him Vizier, and therewith a Ve&s;t of Sables was thrown o|ver him, and the Seals delivered to him. But he being a Per&s;on of Prudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i|macam re|fu&s;es to be Vizier.</NOTE> and Experience of the uncertainty of that Su|blime Office in &s;uch a Conjuncture of Time, as was at pre&s;ent; began before the Grand Seignior, much to bewail his hard Fate, which hurried him into an Honour too high and weighty for him to &s;upport; de|claring, That he only de&s;ired to live in the Degree of Chimacam, that he might ne|ver depart from the &s;ide of his Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>With the&s;e, and &s;uch like Words as the&s;e, he moved the Sultan to Compa&s;&s;io|nate his Ca&s;e, and to grant his Reque&s;t: And in his Place was named <HI>Halil</HI> Pa&s;ha,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Vi|zier na|med.</NOTE> at that time Pa&s;ha of <HI>Diarbekir</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opo|tamia,</HI> who had been Chief Chamberlain to <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> when he lay in the Siege before <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>To execute this Great Affair, two Aga's were di&s;patched immediately away by the Po&s;t, to bring this <HI>Halil</HI> Pa&s;ha to <HI>Adriano|ple;</HI> and in the mean time all the Affairs of the War remained at a &s;tand, which was very &s;trange at &s;uch a Sea&s;on, when the Armies were ready to take the Field; and that all things mu&s;t give way to the Con|&s;ideration of a &s;ingle Man, who was to be fetched at the di&s;tance of above 1000 <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Miles from <HI>Adrianople;</HI> as if no Man could be found like him equal to that great and heavy Charge.</P>

<P>In the mean time for want of the Grand Vizier all things were at a &s;tand; for the <HI>Tartars</HI> refu&s;ed to move until they received In&s;tructions from the New Grand Vizier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All at a &s;tand until the Vizier's coming.</NOTE> and the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Troops which were upon their March at this time, and ready to pa&s;s into <HI>Europe,</HI> retarded, and &s;lackned their Pace, until they knew what new Orders this Vizier would give them. How&s;oever the Officers both of Hor&s;e and Foot, which were already in <HI>Europe,</HI> were ha&s;tned on their March with all &s;peed, that at the Ar|rival of the Grand Vizier, the whole Ar|my might be found in a good po&s;ture on the Frontiers near <HI>Belgrade:</HI> And the Pre|parations for the Sea in the mean time went forward with all Chearfulne&s;s, it be|ing de&s;igned, that the Maritime Force &s;hould be equal to that of the la&s;t Year, being reinforced with many Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Tripoli, Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Algier;</HI> in all which Expeditions the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople</HI> was very vigilant and active.</P>
<P>At length, about the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the Grand Vizier arrived at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> near which Place he was met at <HI>Haf&s;a,</HI> a|bout three Hours di&s;tant from thence, by many of the Principal Officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier arrives, and recei|ved by the Grand Seignior.</NOTE> and at an Hours di&s;tance from the City, by the Mufti, and Chimacam, and others; who in great Pomp and State conducted him to the Pre&s;ence of the Sultan, by whom he was graciou&s;ly received, and the Seals de|livered to his Hand; after which being Ve&s;ted with a Coftan lined with Sables, he made a &s;hort Prayer, and withdrew him|&s;elf from the Pre&s;ence of the Sultan, and being come to the Vizier's Palace, he be|&s;towed Coftans on all the Pa&s;ha's, and Of|ficers of his Court, confirming the Old Ones in their Places, and declaring New where they were vacant.</P>
<P>Having taken &s;ome Refre&s;hment that Night, the next Day he held a Solemn Council, at which it was concluded, what Methods were to be taken, for the future;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Coun&s;el of</HI> War, May 1692.</NOTE> and it was agreed, That on the 31&s;t of this Month the Vizier's Tents were to be pitch|ed at the u&s;ual Place without the City; and
<PB N="438" REF="243"> al&s;o the Jani&s;ar-Aga's; and that the Day following they were both in Per&s;on to March out into their Tents; and that on the 6th of <HI>June</HI> they were to begin their Journey towards <HI>Belgrade;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier marches to|wards <HI>Bel|grade.</HI></NOTE> accordingly the Jani&s;aries led the Van, as was u&s;ual, and proceeded a Day before the Vizier, and the Spahee's; but they had not march|ed a Day before that being united with the other Militia, they began to Mutiny, ex|claiming for their Pay, and prote&s;ting that they would not proceed until fir&s;t they had received their &s;ix Months Pay in Arrear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jani|&s;aries mu|tiny for Pay,</NOTE> with their Ve&s;ts of thick Cloth, as al&s;o the Donative due to them at the Inaugura|tion of every New Sultan: To content the&s;e People, the Grand Vizier i&s;&s;ued out to them with all &s;peed their &s;ix Months Pay; and with fair Words and Promi&s;es, he &s;o pacified them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are paci|fied.</NOTE> that they quietly marched forward to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> prote&s;ting how&s;oever, not to pa&s;s the <HI>Save</HI> without their Cloth and Donative.</P>
<P>With this Pacification the Grand Vizier taking a little Breath, began to con&s;ider of the manner how to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf; and becau&s;e an Able, and Faithful Chimacam, who remains near the Per&s;on of the Grand Seignior, is always a great &s;upport to a Vizier, he &s;ent for the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> named <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> to come to him, who in the Time of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Grand Vizier, had been Seraskier, or General again&s;t the <HI>Poles:</HI> This Per&s;on being come to him, he made him Chimacam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A New Chimacam made.</NOTE> and di&s;placed the o|ther (who, as we have &s;aid, refu&s;ed late|ly the Vizier's Office) and &s;ent him to re|main Pa&s;ha at <HI>Erzirum,</HI> which is in <HI>Arme|nia Major.</HI></P>
<P>One would have imagined that this Vi|zier might have thought him&s;elf &s;ecure with that Chimacam, who had refu&s;ed, (as we have &s;aid) the Vizier's Office, &s;o fairly and &s;o lately offered to him by the Sultan, &s;o that a little kind A&s;pect, and few oblig|ing Words might have made him entirely his own; but there is a Fate among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> that neither the Grand Seignior is con&s;tant to his Viziers, and Chief Officers, nor they to the Inferiour Mini&s;ters, who act under them, never believing them|&s;elves &s;ecure, but with tho&s;e who are their own Creatures, by which continual Revo|lutions all things remain in di&s;traction, and a Vizier hath &s;carce learned, or become Ma&s;ter of his Trade, before he is di&s;gra|ced, and thrown down from his Sublime Office, with all his Kindred and Dependan|ces, to the Aby&s;s of Mi&s;ery, and Ruine, of which we have di&s;cour&s;ed at large in a|nother Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon which Maxime this Vizier called for his own Creature to make him Chima|cam, and recalled the late Mufti, whom the preceding Vizier had Exiled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mufti recalled.</NOTE> which was the more ea&s;ily done, the Place being vacant by the Death of the Mufti who was la&s;t made.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Embroils and Changes could not do le&s;s than hinder the Proceed|ings of the main Bu&s;ine&s;s; for the <HI>Budzi|ack Tartar</HI> refu&s;ing to follow the Com|mand of the <HI>Tartar Han,</HI> the Grand Seig|nior &s;ent one Me&s;&s;enger after the other to ha&s;ten the March of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> command|ing them with 3 or 4000 Hor&s;e to carry on each a Sack of Wheat, or Meal, for the Relief of <HI>Great Waradin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Waradin</HI> in great di&s;tre&s;s.</NOTE> from whence frequent Letters came, that they being re|duced to the Extremity of Famine, could not longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but &s;hould be forced to deliver them&s;elves up into the Hands of the Enemy, unle&s;s &s;peedily &s;uccoured.</P>
<P>In this manner unthought of Accidents fell out full of Di&s;appointments, by which neither the Forces at Land, nor at Sea a|mounted to half the Power they were of the la&s;t Year.</P>
<P>Thus far in this Year of 1692, have we &s;hown the State of Affairs in <HI>Turky,</HI> whil&s;t at <HI>Vienna</HI> things were in preparation for the following Campaign, and many Coun|&s;els of War were held by the General Of|ficers, in Pre&s;ence, and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden.</HI></P>
<P>We being now in the Month of <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> all the Endeavours were bent for taking <HI>Great Waradin</HI> before the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army &s;hould take the Field, and come to relieve it, of which there was now no great probability, in regard that from all &s;ides Advices came, that the Town laboured under the la&s;t Ex|tremity of Famine; the which was not on|ly confirmed by Letters from thence to <HI>A|drianople;</HI> but by a Me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched with Letters to <HI>Giula</HI> and <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> from the Be&s;ieged, to give an account of the mi&s;erable Condition of the Place, the Cir|cum&s;tances of which were reported to be &s;o wretched, that in all probability the Place could not hold out much longer.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e many times Reports are fal&s;e, and that Men do often, e&s;pecially in War, magnifie, or dimini&s;h things accord|ing to their Humour or Intere&s;t; it was judged fit not to expect until Famine had forced the Be&s;ieged to &s;urrender, for that might prove &s;till the Work of &s;ome Months, and in the mean time give the Enemy means to relieve the Place; wherefore it was re&s;olved to force the Surrender, and the care thereof being committed to Gene|ral <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> he with all Expedition and Diligence having drawn his Troops toge|ther from their Winter-Quarters, and ad|jacent Places, po&s;ted him&s;elf near the Old

<P>On the 11th &s;ome Hundreds of the Be|&s;ieged &s;hew'd them&s;elves without the For|tre&s;s, but withdrew without farther At|tempt; on which Day 11 Heydukes were killed, and 15 wounded.</P>

<P>The 16th, 17th, and 19th, little or no|thing of moment was done, by rea&s;on of the continual Rains; but by this time the more heavy Cannon being come, the Breach was made wider and larger; &s;o that Gene|ral <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that the Enemy might be terrified thereby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continue re&s;olute to maintain the Town.</NOTE> he &s;ent a Trumpeter to make them the la&s;t Summons, threat|ning them in Default thereof, to give no Quarter either to Man, Woman, or Child; but as yet the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;howed no fear of the Menaces pronounced again&s;t them; and an Old, Grave <HI>Turk</HI> &s;howing him&s;elf on the Walls, called to the Be&s;iegers, and admo|ni&s;hed them to withdraw their Troops from under the Walls of the City, which they &s;hould never take, the Be&s;ieged being re|&s;olved to Live and Die together in the &s;ame.

<P>LE vingti&eacute;me du mois pa&s;&s;&eacute; arriva icy devant la ville une Tartane de Mar|&s;eille, avec des Lettres expre&s;&s;ement depe|ch&eacute;es de la part de la Cour de France pour l'Amba&s;&s;adeur d'icelle, qui re&s;ide icy. Le dit Amba&s;&s;adeur fit un peu apr&eacute;s &s;cavoir au Caimacam Pa&s;ci&agrave;, que l'arm&eacute;e Royalle &s;ons la conduite du Duc de Luxembourg avoir touta fait battu l'arm&eacute; des Etats des Pro|vinces Unies, avec la perte de tout leur bagage, artillerie, &amp; amunition de guerre: Combien qu'elle fut un peu au paravant ren|forc&eacute;e de vingt mille Alemans: Et que la Flotte Froncoi&s;e, apr&eacute;s avoir cherch&eacute;e &amp; trouv&eacute;e l'es Flottes des Anglois &amp; Hollan|dois combin&eacute;es dans le Canal, l&eacute;s avoit at|taqu&eacute;es &amp; mi&s;es en fuitte, avec la perte de vingt vai&s;&s;eaux de guerre, pris ou ruinez. Il y adjouta encor beaucoup des autres nou|velles invent&eacute;es, receues de Allemagne, Angleterre, Eco&s;&s;e, Irlande, &amp; Savoye: Les quelles furent debit&eacute;es entre la popu|lace avec une telle vray &s;emblance, que la plu&s;part les creurent &eacute;tre ab&s;olument veri|tables.</P>
<P>En &s;uitte de cela demanda le dit Amba&s;|&s;adeur la permi&s;&s;ion de fair publiquement des feux de joye: &amp; la commodit&eacute; de la po&s;&s;e pour un gentilhomme, qu'il di&s;oit &eacute;tre expre&s;&s;ement envoy&eacute; du Roy &s;on Maitre; pour communiquer ces nouvelles au Grand Vizir. On luy accorda l'un &s;ecrettement, &amp; l'autre ouvertement: &amp; parce que je n'avois receu le moindre &aacute;vis de tout cel&agrave;, ny de l'&eacute;tat des autres affairs de la Chr&eacute;ti|ent&eacute;, je ne pouvois rien farre contre le de|bite de ces nouvelles. Mais cette joye ne dura pas longtems; mais &s;eulement ju&s;ques au 22. quand il arriva icy un expre&s;&s;e du Grand Vizir: &amp; peu apres le Caimacam Padi&s;ci&agrave; me fit tenir deux de vos Lettres tres civiles du 4 &amp; 6 du mois pa&s;&s;&eacute; d'Aout, bien Seell&eacute;es &amp; conditionn&eacute;es, avec les Let|tres des Me&s;&s;ieurs les Etats Generaux, &amp; des autres. Par celle&s;cy j'appris la con|qu&ecirc;te ab&s;olve d'Irlande, &amp; la treraitte du Roy Jaques en France. Je ne doute pas, &s;i le Roy Guillaume pourroit encor cette &eacute;t&eacute;e employer &s;es forces contre la France, que cette campagne &s;e termineroit heure&s;e|ment pour les Alliez.</P>
<P>Les Batailles ont &eacute;t&eacute; a&s;&s;ez rudes &amp; diffi|ciles: Mais pui&s;que le Prince de Waldecq a remi&s;e l'arm&eacute;e des Etats en meilleur &eacute;tat le 24 de Juillet, qu'elle ne fut devant la ba|taille, &amp; qu'il m&ecirc;me en a donn&eacute; avis aux Etats, qu'il vouloit le 27 chercher l'enne|my, &amp; luy livrer bataille de nouveau: &amp;,
<PB N="484" REF="267"> que les Flottes d' Angleterre &amp; d' Hollande &s;ont en &eacute;tat de &s;e remettre bien t&ocirc;t en mer, j'e&s;pere, que nous en aurons en peu de tems des bonnes nouvelles, comme au&s;&s;i des arm&eacute;es des Alliez, principalement de cella de Savoye, que je croy &amp; con&s;idere comme la principalle.</P>
<P>Je &s;uis en cela du m&ecirc;me &s;entiment, que V&punc; Excel. que la France &s;uccomber&agrave; t&ocirc;t ou tard, qu'elle &s;e remue, tant qu'elle veuil|le; &amp; principalement, quand toutes les Forces d'Angleterre &s;e jetteront &s;ur elle. J'ay fait une ouverture de tout cel&agrave;, &amp; de tout ce, qui me par&ucirc;t etre utile aux nos af|faires, au Grand Vizier: &amp; je l'ay exhor|t&eacute; dienvoyer plein pouvoir aux Mini&s;tres de la Porte, qui &s;ont a Comarom, de traitter &amp; conclurre la Paix, ou la trefue, avec les Imperiaux: En quel ces je l'a&s;&s;urois, que V. Exc. &amp; l'Envoy&eacute;d' Angleterre diregeroi|ent &s;elon les ordres du Roy &amp; des Etats l'af|faire de telle &s;orte, que cette guerre &s;i &s;an|glante &s;eroit bien t&ocirc;t houreu&s;ement termi|n&eacute;e d'une on d'autre maniere, avec &s;atisfa|ction &amp; au contentement des Parties. J'ad|joutois encor &agrave; tout cela la feible&s;&s;e de la France, &amp; le grand peril, que ce Roya-Court: &amp; j'ay luy remontr&eacute; de nouveau, &amp; a&s;&s;ur&eacute;, que le Roy, pour eviter &s;a totale ruine, &s;ollicite continuellement &s;ous main le Pape &amp; la Republique de Veni&s;e, pour ob|tenir la Paix par leur interce&s;&s;ion: &amp; par Con&s;equence, qu'il &s;oit tems, que les prin|cipaux Mini&s;tres de la Porte ouvrent enfin les yeux, &amp; que &s;e re&s;&s;ouvenans de la per|fidie des Francois tant de fois eprouv&eacute;e contre tous les contracts faits avec la Porte, ils ayent enfin une horreur de cette nation perfide &amp; trompeu&s;e, qui ne cherche rien d'autre cho&s;e, que &s;on prope inter&ecirc;t, &amp; qui ne &s;e &s;oncie point des plaintes des leurs Alliez, form&eacute;es &s;ur le dementy de leur pa|role, honneur, &amp; &s;ermens, quand elle peut Seulement parvenir au bout de leur de&s;&s;eins. J'ay au&s;&s;i donn&eacute; avis au grand Vizir de la re&s;titution &amp; du renforcement des Arm&eacute;es des Etats par terre, &amp; par mer: &amp; l'ay parfaitement inform&eacute; del &eacute;tat des Arm&eacute;es des Alliez &s;ur le Rhin, &amp; la Meu&s;e, dans le Pays Bas, la Savoye, Catalogue, &amp; le Milanois, &amp; principalement de la victoire remport&eacute;e en Irlande. J'ay envoy&eacute; cette lettre par po&s;te au Camp des tures: &amp; j'en attens la reponce avant encor que je ferme celle cy, afin de la communiquer &agrave; V. Excel.</P>
<P>Le Caimacam Pa&s;cia me demanda, aux quelles conditions je croiois qu'on pourroit faire unc Paix: Sur cel&acirc; je luy remontray le vray inter&ecirc;t de &s;on Maitre, &amp; dis, que j'attois d'opinion, qu'on feroit la tr&eacute;ve &agrave; cette condition, que chacun retiendroit, ce, qu'il po&s;&s;ede. Ce Caimacam e&s;t a&s;&s;ez por|t&eacute; pour la paix, mais il depend tout du Grand Vizir: C'e&s;t pourquoy qu'il faudr&agrave; attendre &s;a reponce &s;ur ma derniere, pour &s;cavoir &s;a re&s;olution la de&s;&s;us. Mais je ne m'imagine pas, que cette cour fer&agrave; quel|que cho&s;e dans cette affair ay, devant que la Campagne &s;era finie; parce que les troup|pes des Imperiaux dans ces quartiers l&agrave; &s;ont &s;i peu con&s;iderables, &amp; celles des Turcs fort nombreu&s;es, d'autant plus, que le Grand Vizir ait de&s;ia mis le Siege avec &s;on Arm&eacute;e de vant Nizze, &amp; que le T&oacute;kely joint avec les Turcqs ait fait une inva&s;ion dans la Tran&s;ylvanie avec une terrible Ma&s;|&s;acre des Trouppes Imperiales, &amp; la pri&s;e de leur General Hei&s;ler, du Marquis Do|ria, &amp; du Comte Magni, avec beaucoup des autres Officiers: Joignez-y la pri&s;e de Widin. Tout cel&agrave; cau&s;er&agrave; un tres grand changement dans les traittez de Paix, &amp; dans les affaires. On a au commencement traitt&eacute; cette Nation, comme tout a fait abatue, &amp; vaincue: Ju&s;ques &agrave; ce, qu'on o&s;oit preten|dre d'elle le tribut: Ce qu'irrita les Turcs de telle &s;orte, qu'etans au de&s;e&s;poir ils &s;e &s;ont portez &agrave; une vigoureu&s;e defence: &amp; on aur&agrave; &agrave; faire de les remettre &agrave; la rai&s;on, &s;i la Campagne &s;e termine pour eux &s;i heu|reu&s;ement, comme elle &ecirc;t commenc&eacute;e. Con|noi&s;&s;ant donc, combien il importe au Roy d' Angleterre &amp; aux Etats, que cette guer|re &s;oit finie, je ne lai&s;&s;eray pas d'avertir V. Excell. de tems en tems de tout ce, que s'y pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Le 25 du mois pa&s;&s;&eacute;, quand toutes les preparations &eacute;toient faittes par l'Amba&s;&s;a|deur de Francoi&s;e pour les rejoui&s;&s;ances publiques, le Caimacam, &eacute;tant mieux in|form&eacute;, fit defence aux Mu&s;iciens de s'en al|ler au palais du dit Amba&s;&s;adeur: &amp; ain&s;i di&s;parut toute cette joye Francoi&s;e; de &s;orte qu'on alluma &s;eulement quelques cen|taines des lampes, &amp; qu'ondechargea tro&s;|fois quelques pierriers retirez des barques Francoi&s;es, mis dans la ba&s;iecourt du dit h&ocirc;tel. Cette Ceremonie &s;e finit &agrave; huit heures du &s;oir: &amp; le jour &s;uivant l'Amba&s;|&s;adeur fit &ocirc;ter tout cet appareil &agrave; l'in&s;tance Serieu&s;e du Caimacam: Mais il ne peut pas digerer cela, &s;ans en montrer &s;on mecon|tentement, &amp; chagrin.</P>

Cette reponce me fait juger (&s;auf un meilleur jugement) que le Grand Vizir attendr&agrave; ju&s;ques &agrave; la fin de cette Campagne, &amp; qu'il prendr&agrave; &s;es me&s;ures, &s;elon l&eacute; &s;ucces de &s;es entrepri&s;es, &amp; de celles des Arm&eacute;es des Alliez: &amp; qu' apr&egrave;s il former&agrave; la de&s;&s;us &s;es re&s;olutions de faire la Paix, ou de continuer la guerre.</P>
<P>Le 9 Sept. &s;e rendit la ville de Nizza par accord au Grand Vizir: &amp; le 16. l'Arm&eacute;e decampa &amp; marcha vers Semendria.

<P>Mais on m'a&s;&s;ure apre&s;ent, qu'on ne lai&s;&s;er&agrave; pas partir ce vai&s;&s;eau d'icy, avant que d'avoir re&s;titu&eacute; tout ce qu'on a arr&ecirc;t&eacute;, aux proprietaires: Ce qui fer&agrave;, que le dit Amba&s;&s;adeur en recevr&agrave; une petite Morti|fication.</P>
<P>Le 4 de ce mois on envoya d'icy &agrave; Jam|bol, par ordre de la Cour, quelques Offici|ers, qui en ramenerent le 10 un Prince Tartare, nomm&eacute; Saadet Jeray, pour &s;uc|ceder au Han des Tartares, qui fut depo&s;|&s;ed&eacute; le m&ecirc;me jour de &s;a dignit&eacute;. Le jour Suivant le Grand Vizir pre&s;enta le dit Prince au Grand Seigneur; &amp; fut il cou|ronn&eacute;, mais avec fort peu de Ceremonies, Empereur de Tartarie, &amp; renvoy&eacute; le 18 &agrave; la Crim, pour mettre ordre nece&s;&s;aire &s;ur les Affaires, avec un commandement ex|pres, de faire une Inva&s;ion en la Po|logne.</P>
<P>On dit, que ce changement e&s;t arriv&eacute; &agrave; cau&s;e, que le vieux Han a tach&eacute; de divertir le Grand Vizir contre le Sentiment du tout le con&s;eil de guerre, de s'en aller en per&s;onne en Campagne, afin de ne hazar|der pas derechef la reputation de cet Em|pire, pui&s;qu'il ne pouvoit pas a&s;&s;urer laPorte de la &s;ecourir avec &s;es Trouppes Tartares, parce qu'on y attendoit, &amp; craignoit, l'ar|rivement de l'Arm&eacute;e Mo&s;covite: &amp; que les Albanois, ou Arnottes, auroient a&s;&s;ez &agrave; faire de garder leur propre pa&iuml;s, menac&eacute; par les armes victorieu&s;es des Venitiens: &amp; qu'ain&s;i ces Trouppes ne &s;e pouvans joindre avec l'Arm&eacute;e capitale des Turcs, on &s;eroit contraint de &s;e &s;ervir &amp; contenter des &s;eules Trouppes ordinaires des Jani&s;&s;aires &amp; des Spahis, avec celles d'A&s;ie; le&s;quel|les jointes en&s;emble ne &s;eroient en aucune maniere &s;uffi&s;antes pour re&s;i&s;ter &agrave; l'Arm&eacute;e Imperialle. C'e&s;t pourquoy le Han des Tartares &eacute;toit d'avis, qu'on feroit mieux de garder Seulement les frontieres par des Se|raskiers Particuliers, &amp; que le Grand Vizir les pourroit &s;outenir de tems en tems de Con&s;tantinople, ou d'Adrianople avec des Trouppes fraiches &amp; nouvellement lev&eacute;es: &amp; que de cette maniere on defendroit ai&s;e|ment non &s;eulement les Frontieres, mais au&s;&s;i la reputation des armes du Grand Seigneur.</P>
<P>Et parceque cet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">avis, ou con&s;eil, du Han des Tartares fut rejett&eacute;, &amp; re&s;ut&eacute; par le Kiahaia Bei, ou Lieutenant General des Jani&s;&s;aires, &amp; de ceux de &s;a faction, avec des autres rai&s;ons, lequel Lieutenant e&s;t &agrave; pre&s;ent en Fort Grand Credit &agrave; la Cour, &amp; que le Han s'en fachoit, on a, apres qu'il f&uacute;t &s;orty du Con&s;eil, arr&ecirc;t&eacute; de le demettre de &s;a dignit&eacute;. Ce qu'&eacute;tant peu apres en|tendu du Grand Han, il renonca le lende|main au Governement de la Crim, pour pre|venir cet affront: &amp; il demande apre&s;ent la permi&s;&s;ion de faire le pelerinage de Mecca.</P>
<P>Le Grand Vizir ne fait que &s;e preparer &agrave; la Guerre: Mais &s;elon ce qu'on en peut juger, il ne &s;er&agrave; pas aux Frontieres avant la &s;in du Juillet. C'e&s;t pourquoy que je m'imagine, que l'Arm&eacute;e Imperialle feroit un grand coup, &amp; cau&s;eroit une grande Confu&s;ion dans les Trouppes Turques, &s;i elle &s;e mettroit de bonne heure en Cam|pagne.</P>
<P>Je vous puis a&s;&s;urer, Mon&s;ieur, que, &s;i on n'entreprend pas quelque cho&s;e de con|&s;ideration dans cette Campagne contre les Turcs, &amp; Francois, on n'aur&agrave; pas m&ecirc;me &s;ujet de pen&s;er &s;eulement &agrave; la Paix: Mais au contraire, &s;i l'on aur&agrave; le moindre avan|tage contre cette Nation, qu'elle abandon|ner&agrave; le partie Francois, &amp; rechercher&agrave; la Paix incontinent. Il e&s;t donc tres-nece&s;&s;aire, que l'Arm&eacute;e Imperialle &s;oit la premiere en Campagne, &amp; qu'elle previenne les de&s;&s;eins du Grand Vizir: D'o&ugrave; on tirer&agrave; toutes les avantages imaginables.</P>
<P>Les mauvais &s;ucces de la Campagne pa&s;|&s;&eacute; ont extremement avanc&eacute; icy le credit de l'Amba&s;&s;adeur de France, &amp; au Contraire fort diminu&eacute; le re&s;pect &amp; la reputation des Amba&s;&s;adeur d'Angleterre &amp; d'Hollande: &amp; principalement &agrave; l'egard de l'e&s;quadre des Vai&s;&s;eaux de Guerre, qu'on attendoit dans la Mer Mediterran&eacute;e, du quel Me&s;|&s;ieurs les Etats Generaux m'avoient fait a|vertir: Mais pui&s;qu' on n'en a aucunes nouvelles, &amp; qu'on m&ecirc;me n'en o&s;e pas parler d'avantage, cela fait, qu'on donne l'entier credit aux vanteries des Francois: De &s;orte que les Turques commencent &agrave; &s;e per&s;uader que le Roy de France a a&s;&s;ez des Forces pour non &s;eulement faire de re&s;i|&s;tance aux tous les autres Princes Ch&ecirc;rti|ens, mais encore de les attaquer par tout, &amp; combattre.</P>

<P>AS to the Negotiations of Peace, I know it will be no &s;urprize to hear they are in the &s;ame &s;tate as you left them. For my part I was too &s;hort-&s;ighted to di&s;cover tho&s;e great Inclinations in the Port towards it, which Seignior <HI>Colyer</HI> repre&s;ented, which had made &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions in Seignior <HI>Heemskirk,</HI> that upon Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>'s Death, he came fly|ing with a full Sail down the <HI>Danube,</HI> not to begin the Treaty, but conclude the Peace; and thought it was &s;o ea&s;ie, that it was only to &s;peak with the <HI>Vizier,</HI> and the Bu&s;ine&s;s was done.</P>
<P>He arrived at <HI>Belgrade</HI> the fir&s;t of <HI>Octo|ber S. V. 1692,</HI> the next Day had Audience of the Vizier, and the third he gave in Wri|ting to <HI>Mauro Cordato</HI> to Tran&s;late and give the Vizier his Propo&s;als for a Peace or Truce for <HI>30</HI> Years: The &s;ub&s;tance of which for the Emperor was on the Foot of <HI>Uti po&s;&s;idetis;</HI> under which Notion <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> to retain to him, each liberty to fortifie in their Confines; <HI>Teckely</HI> to be delivered up; the Republick of <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> not to be called to Accounts for Ar|rears of Tribute, or for the future pay any to the Port: For <HI>Poland,</HI> Re&s;titution of <HI>Ca|minieck,</HI> and with-hold in <HI>Podolia,</HI> all <HI>U|crania,</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;telli</HI> on the <HI>Bory&s;thenes, Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Wallachia;</HI> and if the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> made any Incur&s;ions into their Territories, the Port to pay the Damages that Crown re|ceiv'd: For <HI>Venice,</HI> the Province of <HI>Leva|dia, Athens</HI> and <HI>Thebes</HI> to be given them as an Equivalent for the <HI>Morea,</HI> and in like manner &s;everal Territories on the &s;ide of <HI>Le|panto,</HI> and in <HI>Dalmatia:</HI> He expected an An&s;wer to this, and that the Port would change their Old Style of receiving Propo&s;als, and making none, into an open Negotiation by Writing; but he found all this imaginary, and not to be reduced to Practice.</P>
<P><HI>Mauro Cordato</HI> told him, The&s;e Propo&s;als were injurious to the Empire; and ask'd, If he had no other to make? The Reply was, He had no more to &s;ay, till he had an An&s;wer to what he had already propo&s;ed, which he had earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed for many Days in &s;ix Letters to <HI>Mauro Cordato:</HI> The An&s;er was, The Vizier was returning to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and mu&s;t acquaint the Grand Seignior with what pa&s;&s;ed, and he mu&s;t go thither for his An|&s;wer. This &s;tartled him, who thought to have concluded the Treaty at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and imme|diately return'd, &s;o he pre&s;&s;ed for an An&s;wer, or to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; but was told, He could not deve&s;t him&s;elf of his Character, which remained till my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> arrived, to whom Accidents might happen, as had to o|ther Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;o he was forced to go by the <HI>Danube</HI> to <HI>Ru&s;ic,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where he arrived the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> departing from <HI>Belgrade</HI> the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>Octo|ber.</HI></P>
<P>When he arrived fir&s;t at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> Mar|quis <HI>D'Orat,</HI> who was with <HI>Teckely</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> &s;aid, He was no <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> but a <HI>German,</HI> and came from the Emperor. The Port had been &s;en&s;ible it was too great a Con|de&s;cen&s;ion to &s;end their Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Vi|enna;</HI> which Point of Honour they thought regain'd, by having one come to make Over|tures to them, and a particular Mini&s;ter for that Bu&s;ine&s;s in their Hands, whom perhaps they may not ea&s;ily part with.</P>
<P>When Seignior <HI>Heemskirk</HI> was come to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> he would have Vi&s;ited the Chi|macam, who excus'd it, the Grand Vizier not being arrived, who came the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI> and a few Days after an Audience was de&s;ired of him, which he put off, as not ha|ving di&s;cour&s;ed with the Grand Seignior. A private Council was held, Orders &s;ent out to all parts for rai&s;ing Men, and to the Trea&s;u|rer to give Money for providing Cannon, Am|munition, and all things nece&s;&s;ary, to be ear|ly in the Field.

<P>The la&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> his Excellency my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> arrived; he would have enter'd pri|vately, but the Vizier de&s;ired the contrary, that it might not be thought the Port had wanted in their Re&s;pect to him, and his Lord|&s;hip was received with a great deal of Cere|mony, and Numerous Attendance of Chiau&s;es and Jani&s;aries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Audi|ences.</NOTE>The <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> his Excellency had his fir&s;t Audience of the Grand Vizier, and gave him his Credentials, one for his Re&s;i|dence, the other for the Mediation.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh of <HI>March</HI> his Lord&s;hip had his Audience of the Grand Seignior, and was ve|ry kindly received: He &s;poke his Complement, which was Interpreted by <HI>Mauro Cordato;</HI> and the Grand Seignior an&s;wered, That His Maje&s;ty was a good Friend to the Port, and all &s;uch &s;hould be ever kindly received by him.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth of <HI>March,</HI> his Excellency had a private Audience of the Vizier, where was the Mufti. His Lord&s;hip made the Offers of His Maje&s;ty's Mediation for a Peace, or Truce between the Emperor, and his Allies, and the Port, on the Foot of <HI>Uti po&s;&s;idetis,</HI> only <HI>Caminieck</HI> to be re&s;tored, or razed. The Vizier &s;aid in a Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o great Import, he mu&s;t con&s;ult the Heads of the Law, and the Militia, and an An&s;wer &s;hou'd be gi|ven.</P>
<P>The <HI>14th ditto,</HI> his Excellency Signior <HI>Heemskirk,</HI> and <HI>Colyer,</HI> were called to the Vizier to a Publick Audience, where on the Safra &s;ate the Vizier, the Mufti and Cade|lesker on his Left Hand; on his Right the Chimacam, <HI>I&s;mael Pa&s;&s;a</HI> Jani&s;ar-Aga, the Ni&s;angi Pa&s;&s;a, and the Tefterdar, and the three Amba&s;&s;adors, the two Generals on Stools; below the Safra, the Kiah-Beg and all the Heads and Ojacks of the Jani&s;aries, the two Generals, chief of the Spahy's, and chief of the Trea&s;ury; in all near <HI>100</HI> Per|&s;ons: The Rais Effendi came into the middle of the Safra, and read aloud Signior <HI>Heem|skirk's</HI> Propo&s;als, which he owned. This was done only to exa&s;perate the Militia: The Vizier &s;aid, They mu&s;t con&s;ider of them, and give an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The <HI>17th</HI> the Vizier was turned out, and his Excellency finding the Vizier had his De&s;ign in Irritating the People by &s;uch Ex|travagant Demands, went to the new Vizier, Mufti, Cadelesker, and Jani&s;ar-Aga, telling them the&s;e Propo&s;als read were none of his, which was only one plain Propo&s;ition on a <HI>Uti po&s;&s;editis,</HI> which His Maje&s;ty thinking equal, was willing to interpo&s;e his Offices thereon, if the Port thought fit, out of real Friend&s;hip. The Vizier &s;aid, They would con&s;ider of it, and give an An&s;wer. The Mufti &s;aid, The coming of three Emba&s;&s;adors had rais'd great Expectations in the People, and they could do no le&s;s than make known what Propo&s;als had been made: They were very well &s;atisfied of His Maje&s;ty's Friend&s;hip. The Cadelesker and Tefterdar &s;aid, Without Re&s;titution of the <HI>Morea,</HI> there could be no Peace. The Jani&s;ar-Aga, who was come from <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> &s;aid he had &s;een the Propo&s;als, That God would humble the Pride of the Enemy, and cha&s;tize it, he hop'd, this Year.</P>
<P>But his Excellency Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> had vin|dicated him&s;elf clearly to all Mini&s;ters, as his Propo&s;al was, but the other was &s;ent over all the Empire to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the People; but Signior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Interpre|ter.</NOTE> <HI>Tyles</HI> had &s;et all right in three Days.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, when Signior <HI>Heemskirk</HI> had no Intimacy with <HI>Tyles,</HI> he wrote to my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> in <HI>January,</HI> and to the Empe|ror, there was no hopes of Peace; but when he came into a Familiarity with <HI>Tyles,</HI> he was Illuminated, and in <HI>March</HI> wrote His Maje&s;ty, the Peace was in a fair way, and he hoped to be him&s;elf the bringer of the News of it; and yet now <HI>Tyles</HI> &s;ays to us, in eight Months he has been here, they have never done any thing, and the Port will not have Peace, nor were inclin'd to it.</P>
<P>Signior <HI>Heemskirk</HI> was much Embroil'd, and pre&s;&s;ed my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> much to &s;ollicite the Vizier with Memorials; but his Excel|lency had &s;een &s;o ill Effects of his Writing, that he thought it much better to &s;eem Indif|ferent, than Importune, and to attend their An&s;wer to his Propo&s;al.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all their &s;eeming Reluctancies, and high Words, I am of Opinion the <HI>Turks</HI> may be per&s;waded to hearken to Peace, e&s;pecially if the Imperial Army do any thing to purpo&s;e this Summer: The State here is &s;hortly thus.</P>
<P>This pre&s;ent <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>June, N. S.</HI> the Jani|&s;ar-Aga is not yet gone into the Camp, nor will he go (as I think this <HI>10</HI> Days: About a Week after him the Grand Vizier goes; and about a Fortnight after that, the Army will begin to March.</P>
<P>It is not at pre&s;ent &s;trong, not of above <HI>5</HI> or <HI>6000</HI> Men, but the <HI>A&s;iaticks</HI> and <HI>Tar|tars</HI> are to joyn them at <HI>Sofia:</HI> How many they may be is very uncertainly reported; the fir&s;t however will not be Numerous; they rec|kon upon <HI>20000 Tartars,</HI> that will be their greate&s;t Strength, and the&s;e altogether can|not be at <HI>Belgrade</HI> till the latter end of <HI>July</HI> at &s;oone&s;t; &s;o that if the Imperial Army be as &s;trong and as ready, as when I came from <HI>Vienna,</HI> I thought it would be, they will have time enough to attempt any thing, before the&s;e Forces can appear to hinder them.</P>

<P>All thoughts of Peace, and Treaties, being thus laid a&s;ide, the Government em|ployed its utmo&s;t Endeavours, and Coun|&s;el were taken in Matters and Contrivan|ces tending to the War: It was reported, That the Grand Seignior, Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> had re&s;olved to go as far as <HI>Sophia,</HI> where he would pa&s;s the Summer, being nearer to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and the Frontiers in <HI>Hungary;</HI> but the Phy&s;icians per&s;waded the contra|ry, as being prejudicial to the Health of the Sultan, who was already affected with the Drop&s;ie, (the fatal and common Di&s;|ea&s;e of that <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family) for Cure of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan <HI>Achmet</HI> &s;ick of the Drop&s;ie.</NOTE> many Con&s;ultations were held by the Phy&s;icians; who, in regard that they found as yet a Schirrus only upon the Li|ver, they gave great hopes of his Reco|very; how&s;oever the People took occa&s;i|on from hence to di&s;cour&s;e, That in ca&s;e this Sultan <HI>Achmet</HI> were Dead, he would be &s;ucceeded by Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> his Ne|phew, and Son to the late Sultan <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who had been Depo&s;ed: which would be a happy Change for the whole Empire, he being Young and Brave, and as to all ap|pearance, of a Martial Spirit, and a Lo|ver of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>To forward the Preparations for the War with all Expedition po&s;&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati|ons for the War.</NOTE> &s;trict Orders were given to provide <HI>Caminieck</HI> with Provi&s;ions, and nece&s;&s;ary Food, for want of which, the Place laboured under the greate&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>Letters al&s;o, and Commands were di&s;|patched to all Parts in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to ha&s;ten the March of the Jani&s;aries and Spahees, and to enroll new Jani&s;aries, a Method not u|&s;ed in former Times; by which, taking every Pitiful Fellow that offered to come in, they compo&s;ed &s;uch a Band of raw Sol|diers, not only unexperienced in War, but Poor, and Feeble, and Old, that &s;carce one half of them were judged able to hold out a March to <HI>Belgrade.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> al&s;o di&s;patched away 2000 Jani&s;aries to reinforce the Garri&s;on at <HI>Ne|gropont;</HI> likewi&s;e they reinforced <HI>Canea</HI> with Men and Provi&s;ions; as they al&s;o did their Army in and about the <HI>Morea,</HI> and &s;trengthned their Ca&s;tles at the <HI>Dardanelli,</HI> with Soldiers, Gunners, and Engineers, under Command of <HI>Hu&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, who had formerly been Chimacam with the Grand Seignior, but the Troops de&s;igned for <HI>Hungary,</HI> marched &s;lowly. The&s;e Pre|parations being much retarded by the late Change of tho&s;e two great Officers, name|ly, the Grand Vizier, who, as we &s;aid, voluntarily re&s;igned, and the Tefterdar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Changes at Court.</NOTE> or Lord Trea&s;urer, called <HI>I&s;mael Effendi</HI> Ma|tulled, or put out, Di&s;graced, and Exiled; tho' &s;ome reported, That he was &s;ecretly Strangled; which was a &s;trange, and an un&s;ea&s;onable Policy at &s;uch a time as this, to put all things backward by the Death of two prime Officers of State, who perhaps were Innocent, and Good Mini&s;ters: But under &s;uch a Government as this, it is not &s;ufficient to be Wi&s;e, Hone&s;t, and Indu|&s;trious, but you mu&s;t al&s;o be Succe&s;sful, and free of Enemies, which are things not in our power.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Changes, place was made for other Officers; for <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha, a Cun|ning, Knavi&s;h Candiot (as mo&s;t of that Nation are) was made Chimacam in <HI>Adrianople. Mu&s;tapha</HI> Pa&s;ha, who had been Chimacam, and Seraskier on the <HI>Danube</HI> was declared Grand Vizier; and <HI>Cantemir</HI> the Son of <HI>Dica</HI> Bey, who had for 30 Years pa&s;t been Prince of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> was made Succe&s;&s;or to his Father. This Grand Vizier, before he could be warm in his Place, or provided with things nece&s;&s;ary for the War, or acquainted with his Soul|diery,
<PB N="502" REF="276"> and the Chief Commanders, which were to fight under him, was commanded to be gone with all expedition to the Ar|my;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The New Vizier &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">my.</NOTE> which he prepared to do with what &s;peed was po&s;&s;ible. And in regard that all intentions for Peace were laid a&s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May.</HI> The Media|tors di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed.</NOTE> the Mediators were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their further Attendance, and Mr. <HI>Heemskirk</HI> was licen&s;ed to return to <HI>Vienna;</HI> tho' &s;ome difficulties aro&s;e thereupon at the in&s;tance of the <HI>French,</HI> who &s;ugge&s;ted, that <HI>Heem&s;|kirk</HI> was an In&s;trument, and Spye of the Emperor, and a <HI>German;</HI> and not &s;ent as a Mediator from the King of <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e true Mini&s;ter my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> was: And this colour had like to have co&s;t <HI>Heemskirk</HI> dear, had not my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> own'd him for a Mini&s;ter of the King, and unridled the Secret of the two Amba&s;&s;a|dors. In like manner my lord <HI>Paget</HI> had leave to go to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Pera</HI> near <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> which is the u&s;ual place of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adar's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>But as to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador he continued &s;till at <HI>Adrianople;</HI> and when the Vizier marched, he &s;ent <HI>Fontaine</HI> his Dragoman, or Interpreter with him to attend all the Motions of the Vizier, and his Camp.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were in Action, the news from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> was unplea&s;ing, and ad|mini&s;tred Matter for &s;erious Con&s;iderati|on at the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court; where it was reported, That the Army of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> un|der their New <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince did daily increa&s;e, and that the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Sivas,</HI> or <HI>Seba&s;&s;e,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> were in Arms; and that &s;uch was the confu&s;ion in tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Countries, as obliged the mo&s;t powerful of the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Spahees to remain at home on the guard of their own Country and E&s;tates; &s;o that the pre|&s;ent <HI>Ottoman</HI> Force was inferiour to that of the preceding year; and by rea&s;on of the forementioned Changes; to which we may farther add, that of the <HI>Seimen</HI> Pa|&s;ha, who was Lieutenant General of the Jani&s;aries, and advanced to be Aga, or General of the Jani&s;aries, in the place of <HI>I&s;mael</HI> Pa&s;ha. Likewi&s;e divers Captains, who had been Creatures and Favourites of the late General, were deprived of their Commands, lea&s;t they &s;hould make De|&s;turbances, or rai&s;e Factions in the Army; all which, as it dimini&s;hed and enfeebled their Force, &s;o it hindered the early ap|pearance of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Field.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati|ons for the Seas.</NOTE>But the Preparations at Sea again&s;t the <HI>Venetians</HI> proceded more briskly than they did at Land; for in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> 22 Sail of Gallies, and 13 Great Men of War were provided and &s;itted out of the Ar&s;enal at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and ordered to &s;ail down to the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Darda|nelli,</HI> there to join with the Gallies of the Beyes of the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> to which &s;ome Ships of the <HI>Barbarou&s;es</HI> being added, they computed, that they might form a Fleet of 24 Sail of Men of War, be&s;ides Gal|lies.</P>
<P>Things proceding thus &s;lowly by Land, for the Cau&s;es before-mention'd, the Vizier did not begin his <HI>March</HI> from <HI>Adrianople</HI> towards the Chri&s;tians, until the 26th of <HI>June</HI> Old Syle, de&s;igning at fir&s;t for <HI>Bel|grade;</HI> when on a &s;udden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier begins his march from <HI>Adri|anople.</HI></NOTE> expre&s;s Orders were given to the Army to change the cour&s;e of their March, and leave the Road to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and take that for <HI>Valachia,</HI> and through that Country to enter into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania:</HI> This alteration was the more &s;urpri&s;ing to the <HI>Germans,</HI> who expected not the <HI>Turks</HI> on that &s;ide, becau&s;e it was not known above a Week or 10 Days be|fore the departure of the Vizier, the which Coun&s;el was judged to have been given by the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, or other|wi&s;e by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who propounded to the Vizier to join him on the way with &s;uch a Force, as &s;hould make up his Ar|my at lea&s;t 80000 Men.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the&s;e Matters were con&s;ult|ing, news came that the <HI>Germans</HI> had a de&s;ign to lay &s;iege to <HI>Belgrade;</HI> and on their way thither had de&s;igned again&s;t the Palancha's of <HI>Jeno,</HI> and <HI>Julia,</HI> and threat|ned the <HI>Turks</HI> with deva&s;tations over all the plain Countries; and &s;ince the taking of <HI>Great Waradin,</HI> &s;treightned <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> with want of Provi&s;ions; which put the <HI>Turks</HI> into &s;ome confu&s;ion both at home and abroad, and diverted entirely the de|&s;ign of the <HI>Turks</HI> upon <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> where the mo&s;t mi&s;chief might have been done on the Imperial Dominions; becau&s;e <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania</HI> hath ever been e&s;teemed the mo&s;t convenient Door to let the <HI>Turks</HI> into <HI>Ger|many.</HI></P>
<P>But what about the &s;ame time al&s;o cau&s;ed &s;ome de&s;turbances at home, was a Terrible Conflagration which happened at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fire at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> the Fire began fir&s;t in the Street called <HI>Zubali,</HI> where they make the Mu&s;quets, and all &s;orts of Arms for the Grand Seignior's &s;ervice, de&s;troying all the Forges, and In&s;truments belonging to that Work; and the fire taking its way, con&s;umed all before it, until it came to the great Capan, which is the chief, and only Magazine for Flour, and Corn, and all Provi&s;ions what&s;oever, laid up for the U&s;e of the City; and afterwards taking up the Hill, it took its cour&s;e down by the way of <HI>Balata,</HI> and con&s;umed at lea&s;t

<P>This great Conflagration being over, People began to enquire after the News which the Expre&s;&s;es brought from the Ar|mies, from all parts; and particularly that from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> was of con&s;iderable importance; giving a Relation, that the New <HI>Arab</HI> Prince, <HI>Emir</HI> by Name, who reckned his De&s;cent in a Direct Line from their Pro|phet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> brought an Army into the Field, pretending to make him&s;elf Sove|raign of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> to which he had an He|reditary Right, and Title: His Army daily increa&s;ing, obliged the Grand Seig|nior to &s;end many of his Troops out of <HI>Europe</HI> under the Command of the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;nia</HI> to reinforce the Militia of tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>The European Generals being unac|quainted with the Situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and qualities of tho&s;e Countries, and not knowing that in the Month of <HI>July</HI> the Rivers upon the melting of the Snows &s;well to a prodigi|ous heighth, were &s;trangely &s;urprized to find them&s;elves without any cau&s;e, or knowing how it came about, in the mid&s;t of a deep Water: For being encamped in the Vally of a flat Country, the <HI>Arabs</HI> opened their Sluces, and having made &s;ome Channels like Aquaeducts, they let &s;o great a Flood of Waters out of the Neighbouring Rivers into the Turki&s;h Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> drowned in the Waters.</NOTE> that before the <HI>Turks</HI> under&s;tood from whence that Inundation proceded, 6 or 7000 of them were drowned, and the re&s;t being put into confu&s;ion, and en|deavouring to &s;ave them&s;elves, fell into the hands of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and were all cut in pieces, or made Pri&s;oners; only the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Bo&s;nia</HI> with 14 more e&s;caped of all that multitude: And &s;oon after this de|feat the <HI>Arabs</HI> attacked, and took a Cara|van, with the Spoils of which they en|riched them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The news of this Defeat very much di&s;|couraged the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> having lo&s;t by this accident 25000 Men of their own Friends and Acquaintance, which became the more &s;en&s;ible to them at that time, when the Turki&s;h Army became &s;o feeble in <HI>Hungary,</HI> that had not the Tartars a&s;|&s;i&s;ted them with great Numbers, the Vi|zier would have been forced to return home with Confu&s;ion, and Di&s;honour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> being made &s;en&s;ible of the great need that the <HI>Turks</HI> had of them, &s;tood the more &s;trongly on their Terms, and made &s;ome difficulties of joining with them, but at length &s;uffered them&s;elves to be worked upon, when they &s;aw the rich Pre&s;ents which the Grand Signior had &s;ent to the New <HI>Tartan Han,</HI> to engage him to come early this Year into the Field; and when they &s;aw the rich Ve&s;ts lined with Sables, and the Sword &s;et with great Diamonds, with 40000 Zaichins in Mo|ny, they needed no other Rhetorick, or per&s;ua&s;ive Arguments to prevail upon them, but all unanimou&s;ly prepared to make an early Campagne.</P>
<P>Upon the news that the Chri&s;tians de|&s;ign'd to be&s;iege <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Vizier ha&s;t|ned his march thither; where by rea&s;on of the many lo&s;&s;es which that Garri&s;on had &s;u&s;tained, a Recruit was &s;ent of 1000 men out of <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> and 2000 <HI>Arnouts</HI> to re-inforce the Garri&s;on. And al&s;o 15000 <HI>Turks</HI> more were detached from the Army in <HI>Bo&s;|nia</HI> to recognize, or take a view of the Chri|&s;tian Forces in tho&s;e Countries; and having pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Save</HI> over three &s;everal Bridges, came and &s;hewed them&s;elves before <HI>O&s;eck,</HI> which was commanded by Lieutenant Co|lonel Baron <HI>Ogiley:</HI> This Governor find|ing him&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Field, kept him&s;elf within his Bul|warks and Fortifications; until the <HI>Turks</HI> having at their lei&s;ure taken a view of the Place, and Country round about, retired back-towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> plundering every thing they could carry with them, toge|ther with Men, Women and Children, which they carried into &s;lavery, to the number of about 3000 Souls. After which <HI>Ogiley</HI> drawing together a Body of about 800 &s;elect and choi&s;e Men, he pa&s;|&s;ed the <HI>Save,</HI> and with them &s;urpriz'd a Town called <HI>Bratzein,</HI> to which having given fire, 200 <HI>Turks</HI> were burn'd therein, and the like number endeavouring to &s;ave them&s;elves from the flames; ran out of the City, of which near 100 men were killed on the Place; and many Chri&s;tians lately taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> were relea&s;ed, and &s;ent back to their own Habitations.</P>
<P>Since the taking of <HI>Great Waradin, Te|me&s;waer, Giula,</HI> and <HI>Geno,</HI> were &s;o &s;treightned for want of Provi&s;ions, that they were forced to &s;end away all Women, and Chil|dren, and unnece&s;&s;ary Per&s;ons from the Places; the better to con&s;erve the Victu|als, and Provi&s;ions for the u&s;e of the Gar|ri&s;on: For General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> having for &s;ome time blocked up <HI>Geno,</HI> he made a nearer approach to it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> and on the 16th and 17th day of <HI>June</HI> placing his Camp within half a mile of the place, he attacked the Sub|urbs, which were &s;urrounded with a Ditch, and fortified with Pali&s;adoes; how&s;oever the <HI>Germans</HI> forced the place and took it; the <HI>Turks</HI> retiring with much confu&s;ion in|to the City.</P>

But the <HI>Turks</HI> not hearkning hereunto, a Battery was rais'd, from whence the Guns fired without cea|&s;ing; and thereby in the &s;pace of five or &s;ix days a Breach being made, all matters were prepared for a Storm on the Place; which the <HI>Turks</HI> not daring to with&s;tand, and adventure, they re&s;olved to capitu|late; and on the 27th hung out a White Flag, and &s;ent out three of their Principal Men into the <HI>German</HI> Camp: Where en|tring into a Treaty, it was agreed, that the next day one of their Gates, and Bul|warks &s;hould be delivered up into the Hands of the Be&s;iegers; which being per|formed the following day, the Garri&s;on of the <HI>Turks</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about 800 fighting Men, with 200 Hor&s;e, were convoyed within half an hour's march from <HI>Lippa.</HI></P>
<P>This City was provided with four Bul|warks, fortified with a high and &s;trong Wall, broad and deep Ditches, into which the River <HI>Kerez</HI> hath a pa&s;&s;age; and with|in it hath another retreat fortified with four Towers. In this Place the <HI>Germans</HI> found 35 Bra&s;s, and three Iron Guns, with other Warlike Stores, as 20000 pounds of Powder, and other Ammunition pro|portionable.

<P>The Grand Vizier being on his march to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the news of what had hap|pened at <HI>Geno,</HI> and <HI>Philagoras</HI> was brought to him; and thereby &s;u&s;pecting that <HI>Te|me&s;waer</HI> would be the next enterprize of <HI>Heu&s;tler,</HI> di&s;patched immediately Orders to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Belgrade</HI> to &s;end another Convoy, and more Troops thither to re-inforce the Garri&s;on of <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> with Men and Provi&s;ions. But the Pa&s;ha with &s;everal other Commanders refu&s;ing to obey, upon certain pretences, that &s;uch a De|tachment would be the Ruin of the Place, and that to &s;ave <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> they &s;hould lo&s;e <HI>Belgrade;</HI> the Vizier became &s;o enra|ged, that with his own Hand he killed &s;ix of the Principal <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 11.</NOTE> who were Com|plices with the Pa&s;ha, and left their Dead Bodies in the Streets to the view and ter|ror of others.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI> who commanded the Imperial Army, prepared all nece&s;&s;aries to be&s;iege the Place.

<P>The Chri&s;tians approaching near the <HI>Turks</HI> on the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t.</NOTE> began to fire on all &s;ides from the Town; whil&s;t the Germans on the contrary, were bu&s;ily working on their Lines of Circumvallati|on, had not fini&s;hed any Battery until the fifth, when they likewi&s;e began to fire on the City. It was farther at that time de|&s;igned that two of the Chri&s;tian Gallies, well armed, &s;hould drive away from before the Town &s;ome light Turki&s;h Gallies, by which means that &s;ide lying open, they could ea&s;ily encompa&s;s the City on all &s;ides.</P>

<P>In the Management of which, many Er|rors and Blunders were committed: The Trenches were not opened until 13 Days after the Place was Inve&s;ted; and that the Batteries were not ready until 13 Days af|ter that: It was another Over&s;ight, That the Fleet, which &s;hould have hindered all Provi&s;ions from the Town, coming from <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> was not ready before the Town was Inve&s;ted; which was as ridiculous, as when the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> forgot his Mortars, going before <HI>Hamburg;</HI> and &s;o were the <HI>Germans</HI> Cannon, which were not brought before the Town till five Weeks after it was Inve&s;ted.</P>

<P>THIS Morning I-fell upon the Turks and Tartars very early, when they lea&s;t expected me, and having at the fir&s;t on&s;et forced them to retreat beyond the fir&s;t Palanca, I cau&s;ed the Dragoons, with <HI>500</HI> Hor&s;emen to alight from their Hor&s;es, and with their Swords in their Hands to pa&s;s the Ditch: The Enterprize was bold, but vigorou&s;ly executed. The Turks were very &s;trong, their Force con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>40</HI> Troops of Hor&s;e, <HI>1200</HI> Jani&s;aries, with <HI>2800</HI> Tartars newly arrived to Convoy Provi&s;ion into that Fortre&s;s; but being on the other &s;ide of it, they were &s;o hotly attacked, that they were driven to the Ca&s;tle, and upwards of <HI>1000</HI> of them were killed, and <HI>2500</HI> Hor&s;es and Camels taken from them. All the Provi&s;ions which &s;hould have been brought into <HI>Giula</HI> were yet lying in their Mo&s;ques within the Palancha, together with &s;ome thou&s;ands of Mea&s;ures of Corn which came laden on Camels, were burn'd in the &s;ight of the Turks, and thereby all their co&s;t and labours lo&s;t, which were de&s;igned to &s;upply that Place with Provi&s;ions.

<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> returning homewards to <HI>Budziack,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Walachia,</HI> they entirely ruin'd and de&s;troyed the Country. But before we end this Year, and the Accidents which happened there|in, we are to take notice of another terri|ble fire at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> For as there hap|pened one before in the Month of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, &s;o now another broke out on the 26th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> more grievous and terri|ble than any had done for many years be|fore. The former Fire in <HI>May</HI> began at <HI>Balata,</HI> as we have related; but that in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> broke out at <HI>Odun Schele&s;i,</HI> or the Wood-wharf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t&punc;</NOTE> being the common place where all the Timber for building Hou&s;es and Ships is laid, and in which are many hundreds of Chambers of va&s;t bigne&s;s for receiving all &s;orts and &s;izes of &s;quar'd Timber, with millions of Boards, and other Timber fitted for build|ing; the Damage of which amounted to an incredible &s;um; and was of &s;uch a ge|neral terror and con&s;ternation, that had it happened at the time when <HI>Belgrade</HI> was la&s;t be&s;ieged, the People for very affright|ment would have fled from <HI>Philopopolis</HI> and <HI>Adrianople;</HI> and at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf the People were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a Panick Fear, that thou&s;ands of Families were rea|dy to abandon the City, and to fly into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> burn'd a &s;econd time this Year.</NOTE> for a quarter part of the City was burn'd down; and to encrea&s;e this terror among&s;t the People, it was given out, that the <HI>Germans</HI> were coming upon them with a very numerous Army. And it is here very ob&s;ervable, that about that time things being in a doubtful condition, and no news coming from the Army, nor from <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Grand Seignior in a mo&s;t furious rage &s;wore, that if that City were lo&s;t, he would take off the Heads of the Grand Vizier, and of <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha, the Chimacam, who affrighted with this Me|nace, fell &s;ick, and died with fear. The Eunuchs al&s;o in the Seraglio took the con|fidence from hence to &s;peak again&s;t the Go|vernment, exclaiming openly, that if &s;uch Mi&s;carriages were permitted in, and a|mong&s;t the Principal Officers, the Sultan would be forced to quit <HI>Europe,</HI> and take refuge in <HI>Anatolia.</HI></P>
<P>But when the news came that the Siege of <HI>Belgrade</HI> was rai&s;ed, the Anger of the Sultan began to abate, and to be appea&s;ed again&s;t the Chief Officers; and then the language of the People changed its tone, and prai&s;ed the Officers, who but a few days before they had cur&s;ed and condemn|ed to utter Ruine, &s;aying&punc; that the rai&s;ing of this Siege was a Miracle of God, who had heard their Prayers; which brought a va&s;t Confluence of People to their Mo&s;ches, to give Thanks to God, and to make <HI>Corban,</HI> as they call it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corban made at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> and <HI>Adri|anople.</HI></NOTE> which is a kind of Sacrifice, offered in this manner; they who are of the richer &s;ort, kill Sheep and Lambs, and having prepared them, they cut them in pieces, and give them to the Poor, which is a great Charity and Relief to them; and

<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> before this Action were grie|vou&s;ly dejected and ca&s;t down, but were again revived by the news that the Siege of <HI>Belgrade</HI> was rai&s;ed. To the&s;e Misfor|tunes and Mi&s;eries the raging Pe&s;tilence of this Year contributed very much, of which thou&s;ands of People died in all parts of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Dominions; and thus the <HI>Turks</HI> had three Judgments of God upon them this la&s;t Year, namely Fire, Sword, and Pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>And this is all that pa&s;&s;ed this Year of any moment; for the <HI>Venetians</HI>f had neither done, nor attempted any thing; and the <HI>Turks</HI> having lo&s;t nothing, took courage again&s;t the next Year to be early in the field, with a far greater Army than they had this, and likewi&s;e at Sea with a &s;tron|ger, and a more numerous Fleet, having 20 Sail of Stout Men of War in the <HI>Ar|chipelago</HI> already fitted, from 50 to 80 Guns, be&s;ides the increa&s;e of their Gali|ots, and Brigantines on the <HI>Danube.</HI> The&s;e and &s;uch like matters encouraging the <HI>Turks,</HI> with the Expectation of a Peace with <HI>Poland,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador fo|mented, and forwarded &s;o far, that an Am|ba&s;&s;ador being &s;ent from <HI>Var&s;ovia</HI> to <HI>Adria|nople</HI> to treat, the &s;ame backed with the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t; it was generally believed that the Peace was concluded; but how true that was, the Succe&s;&s;es of the next Year will demon&s;trate unto us.</P>

<P> <MILESTONE N="1694"> THIS following Year of 1694. pro|duced no greater Actions than the former, but yet continued &s;till to be &s;uc|ce&s;sful to the Emperor. In the beginning of <HI>March</HI> the Grand Vizier was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his High Office, and &s;ucceeded by <HI>Ali,</HI> Pa&s;ha of <HI>Tripoli;</HI> the cau&s;e whereof was on a &s;light occa&s;ion, which was this; the Vizier being de&s;irous to take &s;ome recre|ation with hunting Hares on a certain day, his Enemies took the opportunity to bring the Sultan that way, where he unluckily met with the Vizier's Dogs, and a noi&s;e of hunting; of which the Grand Seignior enquiring what it meant, &s;ome Enemies to the Vizier an&s;wered, that it was the Grand Vizier, who might have employed his time in management of the Affairs of the Empire, better than in Sports and Re|creations, re&s;erved, and more becoming the plea&s;ures of his Ma&s;ter, than his own; but this (as they added) was no wonder, it be|ing his con&s;tant trade and practice. With which the Sultan became &s;o enraged, that he immediately &s;ent for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand V <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and taking the Seals from him, he deprived him of his Office.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Ali</HI> Pa&s;ha was &s;ent for,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All</HI> Pa&s;ha Vizier.</NOTE> being e&s;teemed a Man of great Courage, and Experience in all State Affairs, and being Arrived at <HI>Adrianople</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> he immediately put forth the Hor&s;e-Tail, which is a Signal that the Vizier de&s;igns his march for the Camp in 40 days afterwards; and to &s;hew his readine&s;s, and zeal for the Grand Seigni|or's Service, he rai&s;ed and equipped 3000 Men at his own Charge, and out of his own E&s;tate. But here we may ob&s;erve, that before the former Vizier was depos'd, Orders had been given, that henceforward no <HI>Venetian</HI> Ships &s;hould be permitted to come into any of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Ports un|der <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Colours, upon con|fi&s;cation of Ship and Lading; how&s;oever two Months were allowed for execution of the Penalty, on tho&s;e Ships which were already arrived within the Ports.</P>
<P>As the Grand Vizier was depos'd for the rea&s;ons afore&s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chimacam <HI>Ahmet</HI> Pa&s;ha ba|ni&s;hed.</NOTE> &s;o al&s;o was the Chi|macam, called <HI>Calailicos Ahmet</HI> Pa&s;ha, of Greek Extraction&punc; in danger of being &s;trangled, had not the Queen Mother, and the Kuzlir Aga, or Chief Eunuch procu|red the favour to have his Puni&s;hment al|tered, and changed to an Exile into <HI>Egypt,</HI> for the many Tyrannies and Cruelties he had committed; and particularly for that he had taken away the Ancient Church called St. <HI>George</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> belonging to the Patriarchate for &s;ome hundreds of Years before that time: In his place <HI>Jeien</HI> Pa&s;ha, a prudent Per&s;on, and one very well practi&s;ed in Affairs, was con&s;tituted Chi|macam; and being the Nephew of the fa|mous <HI>Kupriogli,</HI> gave general &s;atisfaction to all People, and particularly to the Greeks and Chri&s;tians, to whom he al|ways &s;hewed much favour.</P>
<P>At this time, as is u&s;ual, there were two great Factions at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> one in the Seraglio, con&s;i&s;ting of the Queen Regent, the Kuzlir-Aga, and other Principal Cour|tiers; the other Party in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e, were the Mufti, the Grand Vizier, and Principal Officers of the Janizaries, and Spahees: To &s;trengthen the&s;e, after the Death of <HI>O&s;man</HI> Pa&s;ha, the Selictar-Aga was cho&s;en Chimacam, being a Young Man, a <HI>Chirca&s;&s;ian</HI> by Nation, of a very good under&s;tanding, and for his years very well ver&s;ed in Affairs: This Per&s;on being promoted to this Office without the know|ledge or con&s;ent either of the Grand Vi|zier,
<PB N="512" REF="282"> or the Mufti, but only by the Ma|chination or Contrivance of the Kuzlir-Aga and Queen Mother, rendred his Con|dition the more un&s;etled, and uncertain. And indeed not only the Court, but all the Empire was in great Confu&s;ion by rea|&s;on of the weakne&s;s of three or four Sultans &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, of whom we have al|ready given a Character, and particularly of this Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> of whom the be&s;t we can &s;ay is, that he was a Good Natur'd Jolly Prince, and feared no hurt, nor wi&s;h|ed it to any Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But how the &s;tate of Affairs were in tho&s;e days, we may learn from a Letter, which my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> wrote to a Per&s;on of Quality at <HI>Vienna,</HI> dated <HI>April</HI> 24. <HI>N. S.</HI> 1694.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THEY &s;o often change their Mini&s;ters here, that an Amba&s;&s;ador can &s;carce come to treat twice with the &s;ame Per&s;on. Since my arrival here at the Port, they have had three Grand Viziers, three Chima|cams of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> four Chimacams, of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> three Aga's of the Jani&s;a|ries, three Tefterdars or Lord Trea&s;urers, two New Cadile&s;chers or Judges of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Romelia;</HI> and in &s;hort, all the Great Officers of the Empire were changed, (the Mufti only excepted) by which there was &s;uch a New Set of Idiots and Fools got into Places, as would overturn the be&s;t &s;ettled Government in the World. For the&s;e Officers being only &s;uch, as Chance offers, it is a doubtful Wager, whether he proves a Fool, or a Wi&s;e Man; and in ca&s;e he &s;hould prove a Man of Parts, yet he is &s;uffered &s;o &s;hort a time to remain in his Office, that he is in no capacity to improve them.</P>
<P>Amba&s;&s;adors, unle&s;s it be at their fir&s;t Au|dience, and at that of <HI>Congedie,</HI> have no Con|ver&s;ation or Acce&s;s to the Grand Seigniors, and then they affect &s;uch a &s;ort of Grandeur, as may be&s;t cover all their Thoughts by a Si|lence, &s;o that they give no place for any de|bate; and a Man can never lay any foundati|on upon their Words: For as their Ally of <HI>France</HI> &s;corns to be a Slave to his word; &s;o they hold it to be no di&s;honour to be open, and e&s;teem nothing for a Secret. It is true, that very &s;eldom or never, a Mini&s;ter &s;hall re|ceive a flat denial from a <HI>Turk,</HI> for he &s;hall train you on to the very la&s;t point; and when you come to the la&s;t Argument, and Up&s;hot of all, then a Sum of Money mu&s;t make the Conclu&s;ion.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The di&s;orders made by the <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes in the Countries about <HI>Aleppo</HI> did &s;till continue, which cau&s;ed great fears, and apprehen&s;ions at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf: but tho&s;e Countries being far remote, and di&s;tant made little alterations or noi&s;e at Court.</P>
<P>The Negotiations of <HI>Poland</HI> at <HI>Adria|nople</HI> had no &s;ucce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> &s;o that the Envoy was di&s;patched away, <HI>re infect&acirc;.</HI> Some few days afterwards, the Tartar Han quitted the Court with di&s;&s;atisfaction, and all things &s;eemed in much di&s;order; however they talked high of great preparations for the following Campagne: And to make &s;ome evidences thereof, they di&s;patched away 1200 Jani&s;aries from <HI>Adrianople</HI> to <HI>Belgrade;</HI> moreover they &s;ent away 32 Saiques for the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>About this time the Grand Vizier arri|ved from <HI>Tripoli de Soria,</HI> where he had been Pa&s;ha, and was &s;ent for by the Grand Seignior to head the Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> having been recommended by &s;ome Fa|vourites to have been the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t experienced General in the Empire, but the trial &s;hewed him to be a Man rather of the Pen and good Language, than of Arms.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak more fully and pertinently concerning the Negotiations of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Envoy at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> he was lodged at <HI>Demer|de&s;h,</HI> about an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile from the City, in a poor Village, without Ceremony, or any great Equipage; he had a Coach with &s;ix Hor&s;es, in which was a <HI>French</HI> Je&s;uit: His Bu&s;ine&s;s was declared rather to be de|&s;igned to the <HI>Tartar</HI> Han, who was at that time at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> than to the Grand Seig|nior, and accordingly had Audience of him.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it was ob&s;ervable,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poli&s;h</HI> En|voy's Audi|ence with the <HI>Tartar</HI> Han at <HI>A|driano|ple.</HI></NOTE> that during the time of his Audience with the <HI>Tartar</HI> Han, the Poli&s;h Envoy kept his Cap off, until he was bid to &s;it down and be covered; after a few words of Complement, he aro&s;e up and delivered his Letter. The <HI>Han</HI> asked him, whether he had any other Letters for him; to which he replied no. He asked him from whom that Letter was, he an&s;wered, from the King his Ma&s;ter. The Han asked him, whether he had any thing to &s;ay to him by word of Mouth, to which he an&s;wered no, for that all was contained within the Letter. The Han &s;pake in the <HI>Tartar</HI> Language, and the <HI>Pole</HI> in his own. The Audience ended,
<PB N="513" REF="282"> the <HI>Pole</HI> aro&s;e, ki&s;&s;ed the Han's Ve&s;t, re|tired backwards with his Face towards the Han, which is a part of re&s;pect among&s;t <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Ea&s;tern People, all which was over in le&s;s than half an Hours time.</P>
<P>The which Pa&s;&s;age &s;eemed very My&s;te|rious, and not well under&s;tood, from whence, and from whom this Envoy was &s;ent; but being gone out of the Pre&s;ence of the Han, the Negotiation appeared to concern War and Peace, and a Treaty pro|po&s;ed to be held in order thereunto, be|tween the <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> on one &s;ide, and of the Emperor, King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the <HI>Venetian</HI> State on the other. Hereof intel|ligence was given by my Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Heemskirk,</HI> and Heer <HI>Colyer,</HI> to the Emperor, <HI>Venetians,</HI> and all the Allies whom it might concern; the which &s;eemed very &s;trange, that &s;uch a Negotiation &s;hould be &s;et on foot unknown to them, or to the Mediators of the Peace; the which was &s;till more &s;urprizing, when the Orders for &s;uch a Treaty given to a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Mini|&s;ter, were di&s;avowed, and unexpected by the Emperor and the <HI>Venetians;</HI> and what made the Bu&s;ine&s;s the more doubtful, was, That this Envoy brought no Letters for the Mediators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;ham Envoy from <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> from any of the Allies, or Prin|ces concerned; nor did he admit of any Sa|lutes from the Foreign <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Mini&s;ters; for tho' my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> had his Secretary Mr. <HI>Coke,</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Colyer</HI> had his Chief Interpreter upon the Place, yet the <HI>Pole</HI> would admit of none of their Ad|dre&s;&s;es, or Vi&s;its, but adhered clo&s;e to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, with whom he had long and frequent Conferences.</P>
<P>This unu&s;ual way of management of Treaties, gave ju&s;t rea&s;on of &s;u&s;picion to all Per&s;ons, that this Negotiation was no|thing but an Artifice of the <HI>French,</HI> to bring <HI>Poland</HI> into a &s;eparate Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> which perhaps by the Cunning and Crafty In&s;inuations of the <HI>French</HI> might have &s;uc|ceeded, had not the <HI>Pole</HI> too earne&s;tly in|&s;i&s;ted on the Surrender of <HI>Caminieck</HI> into their Hands, with all the Provi&s;ions, Arms, and Fortre&s;&s;es, and with the <HI>Uti Po&s;&s;idetis;</HI> which was a Term at that time, and du|ring the late Treaty, mortally hateful to the <HI>Turks:</HI> Had not that Term, I &s;ay, been unluckily &s;tarted, it is very probable, that the <HI>Turks</HI> would have accepted of a &s;eparate Peace with the <HI>Poles:</HI> And more|over this particular Article would go down the wor&s;e, in regard that the <HI>Turks</HI> had lately repaired that &s;trong Fortre&s;s, and &s;upplied it with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, and of all Parts had made it almo&s;t impregna|ble: And another Difficulty was, That <HI>Poland</HI> was not willing to Surrender &s;ome &s;mall Places which they had taken on the Frontiers of <HI>Moldavia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> aver&s;e to a Peace, with the Sur|render of <HI>Caminiec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE> by which it plain|ly appears, That all this Treaty was no|thing but an Artifice of the <HI>French,</HI> to a|mu&s;e the <HI>Turks,</HI> and try if po&s;&s;ible, by &s;ome Overtures of this Nature, to bring the <HI>Poles</HI> into a &s;eparate Peace.</P>
<P>The Cham of <HI>Tartary</HI> being a Chief Actor, and de&s;igned to bear a principal part in this di&s;gui&s;ed Treaty, finding that hereby he began by his Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Envoy, to lo&s;e his Credit, and Reputation, and that his good Friend the Grand Vizier, (tho' newly put into Place) was tottering, and near being Depo&s;ed, and to be him&s;elf commanded to return into his own Country, he ha&s;tned away this &s;uppo&s;ititious Envoy all he could, and ac|cordingly, by Order of the Grand Seigni|or, he was di&s;patched away with &s;ome In|dignity, and Di&s;grace; neither the <HI>Tartar</HI> Cham, nor the Grand Vizier daring to o|pen their Mouths in his Behalf, or to men|tion any of the Conditions he had propo|&s;ed for a Peace: And &s;uch a Per&s;on mu&s;t have been endued with a good Stock of Confidence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Envoy &s;ent away with Di&s;grace.</NOTE> and Impudence to manage a Bu&s;ine&s;s of the highe&s;t Importance on &s;uch weak Grounds as he had to pretend, e&s;pe|cially at a time when all the Grand Offi|cers of the Empire were upon their Change. But &s;uch as &s;peak mo&s;t favourably of this Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ay, That this <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Envoy, or Agent, was not &s;ent to make a &s;eparate Peace, but to prepare things in order there|unto, by advancing their Conditions, on which the Port might afterwards treat with the Emperor and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> &s;end|ing their Mini&s;ters into <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> with Powers to that purpo&s;e; but all this came to nothing as will appear by the &s;equel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In the mean time all things were in great di&s;order in the Court between tho&s;e Offi|cers who live within and without the Se|raglio, to make up the&s;e Differences. The Grand Vizier, with the <HI>Tartar</HI> Han, Tef|terdar, Pa&s;ha, and Jani&s;ar Aga, and &s;ome o|thers held a Council in the Month of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> where it was re&s;olved, To move the Grand Seignior, to remove the Kuzlir-Aga, and the Haznadar-Aga; and to that end the Vizier made <HI>Talki&s;h</HI> to the Grand Seignior, and the other <HI>Arz,</HI> for removal of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who were Mutinous, and Intriguing in Matters of State.</P>
<P>Upon this Complaint the Grand Seignior grew very angry, and told the Vizier, That the Kuzlir-Aga de&s;erved indeed to be pu|ni&s;hed, for recommending him, the Vizier, to that high Office; adding, That he was neither a Fool, nor a Child, to be governed by other Mens Humours; and that the
<PB N="514" REF="283"> Report was fal&s;e, That the Kuzlir-Aga medled in Affairs of State.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignior &s;howing in this manner &s;ome Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Vi|zier, who had now but little Support be|&s;ides the <HI>Tartar</HI> Cham; it was in&s;inuated to the Sultan, That it was improper for two Princes to live in the &s;ame City; and that it had never been the Practice of for|mer times, for the Cham to re&s;ide at the Port, there to pry into the Secrets of the Empire.</P>
<P>Hereof the Cham having had &s;ome In|timation, and &s;eeing the Di&s;orders ari&s;ing in the Court, and fearing to be &s;ent away, he de&s;ired to be di&s;mi&s;t, pretending that his Pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary in his own Coun|try, he took leave of the Sultan at a So|lemn Audience; and being richly pre&s;ent|ed, he began his Journey homewards, be|ing accompanied out of <HI>Adrianople</HI> by the Grand Vizier.</P>
<P>After the Departure of the Cham, the Grand Vizier's Wife, who was Si&s;ter to the Grand Seignior, was forbidden the Court, which was an evident demon&s;trati|on that her Husband was not likely to con|tinue long in that Office.</P>
<P>The Heer <HI>Heemskirk,</HI> who had been &s;ent to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colyer,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador for the States-General at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> for management of the Peace between the Emperor and the <HI>Turks;</HI> or rather for want of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, the two former, Sir <HI>William Hu&s;&s;ey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> being both Dead. At that time the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeming inclinable to a Peace, King <HI>William</HI> thought it not fit to let pa&s;s this Opportunity for want of an Amba&s;&s;a|dor from <HI>England;</HI> but rather qualified Mon&s;ieur <HI>Heemskirk</HI> then at <HI>Vienna,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador to the Grand Seignior (of which we have for|merly made &s;ome mention) the which had currantly pa&s;&s;ed with the <HI>Turks,</HI> had not the <HI>French</HI> di&s;covered the matter, and de|clared that this <HI>Heemskirk</HI> was no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, nor no Mini&s;ter of the King of <HI>En|land,</HI> but a <HI>German;</HI> and one under Noti|on of an Amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ent for a Spy to de|ceive the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>

<P>Upon Departure <HI>Heemskirk</HI> &s;aid, <HI>He was &s;orry that his Endeavours for putting an end to this Bloody War, had been un&s;ucce&s;sful.</HI> To which the Vizier an&s;wered, <HI>That Peace would be, when God plea&s;ed, and was not at the Plea&s;ure and Will of Man:</HI> And &s;o with|out &s;aying any thing more material, <HI>Heem|skirk</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: and began his Jour|ney from <HI>Adrianople</HI> towards <HI>Belgrade</HI> on the 2d of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>During the&s;e Matters, great were the Di&s;orders at Court; the Grand Vizier grew weary of his Office, and would glad|ly have been rid of it, could he have done it with &s;afety, and Name his Succe&s;&s;or; and in the mean time his Wife endeavour|ed to accommodate Matters between her Husband, and the Kuzlir-Aga: Notwith|&s;tanding which Differences, and the great Animo&s;ities, yet they &s;lackned nothing of their Diligences to be early this Year in the Field, and accordingly Commands were i&s;|&s;ued out to di&s;po&s;e all things thereunto: And an Aga was &s;ent to <HI>Walachia</HI> for 500 Hor&s;es to carry Flour to <HI>Belgrade.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador per&s;waded the <HI>Turks</HI> to open their Campaign this Year, by way of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI> and to induce them to follow his Advice, he a&s;&s;ured them that his King would have an Army this Year in <HI>Germany</HI> of 100000 Men, but the <HI>Turks</HI> never gave much Credence to the Boa&s;tings of the <HI>French,</HI> whom they com|monly &s;tyled with the Name of <HI>Yalangi Francos:</HI> And to &s;econd this Opinion of the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Nogay Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> No|gay Tar|tar.</NOTE> who were &s;etled in a Part of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> made an In|cur&s;ion through that Province into <HI>Tran&s;yl|vania,</HI> and took from thence about 6000 Captives, and a con&s;iderable Booty.</P>

<P>One Capt. <HI>Hely</HI> Commander of a Mer|chant's Ship of 30 Guns, having brought &s;ome Goods to <HI>Smyrna</HI> from <HI>Legorne,</HI> and finding no Goods that pre&s;ented for a Voy|age back again, he re&s;olved to &s;eek his For|tune in &s;ome other Port: The &s;ame Morn|ing Captain <HI>Marine,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Merchant-Man, and Captain <HI>Tei&s;&s;ere</HI> another <HI>French</HI> Man weighed al&s;o, and accompanied the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship half way to the Ca&s;tle, where they remained a Back-&s;tays for &s;everal Hours; and &s;eeing Captain <HI>Hely</HI> turning out, watched an Opportunity to bear down upon him; which <HI>Hely</HI> endeavour|ing to avoid all that was po&s;&s;ible, could not yet hinder the <HI>French</HI> Man from falling foul of him, by which he broke his Sprit-&s;ail Yard, and Jack-&s;taff; and pre&s;ented many Mu&s;quets, and Pi&s;tols at the Men to provoke them to Fight, or commit &s;ome ra&s;h Action, to the Breach of the Peace in the Grand Seignior's Port; but Captain <HI>Hely</HI> managed his Bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;uch Mo|deration, and Courage, that he &s;aved the King's Jack, and took it in, and then hoi|&s;ted it again; and the <HI>French</HI> cutting &s;ome of their own Mizen-Shrouds, <HI>Hely</HI> got clear, and Sailed away towards the Ca&s;tle, with a good part of the <HI>French</HI> Man's Co|lours, being foul of a Block.</P>

<P>There being two Viziers lately Depo|&s;ed, it was commanded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The New Vizier.</NOTE> That the New Vizier &s;hould be actually at <HI>Adrianople</HI> on the 15th of <HI>April,</HI> &s;o as that he might be with the Army in the Field before the Month of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>This New Vizier was called <HI>Ali Pa&s;ha,</HI> as was al&s;o his Predece&s;&s;or, and both had been Pa&s;ha's at <HI>Tripoli</HI> of <HI>Soria,</HI> and came from thence; but as to this, he had no great Reputation for his Qualities: He had five Years ago been Tefterdar, or Lord Trea&s;urer, at the Port; he had been a great Favourite, and an old Friend of the late Kuzlir-Aga; but others who knew him well, had no great Opinion of him, but looked upon him, as a Man of little Experience, without Parts, or Abilities for &s;o great a Charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the New Vizier.</NOTE> and e&s;teemed for a Per|&s;on not likely to continue long in that Su|blime Station.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Matters were preparing for the Camp, again&s;t the Arrival of the New Vi|zier. <HI>Ahmet Pa&s;ha</HI> who had been Chima|cam of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was declared Pa&s;ha of <HI>Arzrum</HI> in <HI>Armenia</HI> Major, and was actual|ly Li&s;ting Soldiers in <HI>Nicomedia;</HI> at which every one wondered, and commonly re|ported, That he having been di&s;obliged by the Court, was there Rai&s;ing and Li&s;ting Soldiers to joyn with the Rebels in <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> of which &s;ome Murmurings coming to the Ears of the Kuzlir-Aga his Friend, he ad|vi&s;ed him to ha&s;ten away with all diligence po&s;&s;ible, for that his loytering in tho&s;e Parts, gave ju&s;t Jealou&s;ie and Ground to the contrary Faction, to report Evil and Dangerous Matters concerning him; and for that rea&s;on he urged him to be gone on the Bu&s;ine&s;s for which he was employ|ed; promi&s;ing, That in ca&s;e he dealt Faithfully and Wi&s;ely in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, he would at his Return u&s;e his be&s;t Endeavors to make him Grand Vizier. The lea&s;t Whi&s;perings of this Nature in the Time of another Sultan, had been &s;ufficient to have taken the Heads both of the Pa&s;ha, and of his Friend the Kuzlir-Aga, but this pre|&s;ent Grand Seignior feared no Evil, nor de|&s;igned it unto others; &s;o that <HI>Ahmet Pa&s;ha</HI> lived boldly, and without controul in <HI>Ni|comedia,</HI> being Proud, Ob&s;tinate, and Ca|pricious, carrying no re&s;pect to the Com|mands and Orders of the Port; but gave out his own Commands to &s;everal Places, to rai&s;e &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Segmen, which are a &s;ort of Foot Soldiers; which he acted

<P>In the mean time News came that the Grand Vizier was &s;peedily expected at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and that he was already arri|ved at <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> which was a Place ancient|ly famous for one of the four General Councils, and oppo&s;ite to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> from whence on the 18th of <HI>April</HI> he pa&s;|&s;ed the Channel into <HI>Europe,</HI> and taking the ready Road leading to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> he entered that City on the 21&s;t of that Month, where he was received with all i|maginable Kindne&s;s by the Faction then predominant in the Seraglio.</P>
<P>And the Vizier to demon&s;trate all Duty and Obedience to the Sultan, as al&s;o Affe|ction to the People, and Militia, he i&s;&s;ued forth the Hor&s;e-Tails on the &s;econd Day after his Arrival, which denotes the Inten|tions of the Grand Vizier to begin his March in 40 Days from the time, or at farthe&s;t on the fir&s;t of the following <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>According to this Ancient Cu&s;tom, the Vizier 20 Days before his Departure pit|ched his Tents, and &s;ent out the Hor&s;e-Tails into the Camp near <HI>Adrianople,</HI> with intent as was reported, to march towards <HI>Belgrade;</HI> but <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> was this Year chiefly in their Eye, as was advi&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; but it appearing, that great Preparations were making by the Imperiali&s;ts, to fall upon <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> altered their De&s;ign, and took their way towards that Place, to Fortifie, and Strengthen it with what Forces they were able.</P>
<P>Upon the Arrival of the Grand Vizier at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> many &s;ad Complaints and La|mentations were brought him from <HI>Te|me&s;waer,</HI> and <HI>Giula,</HI> complaining of their &s;treightned Condition for want of Provi&s;i|ons; upon which it was re&s;olved to &s;up|ply them with Rice and Corn of all &s;orts; and the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> in the ab&s;ence of the Vizier, &s;ent them &s;everal Hor&s;e Ladings of Provi&s;ions, and Money to the value of 40000 Dollars, or 80 Pur|&s;es, under the Convoy of 800 Jani&s;a|ries.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Grand Vizier was acting in <HI>Hungary,</HI> Advices came from all Hands in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and was reported as well from <HI>Euro|peans,</HI> as from <HI>A&s;iaticks,</HI> that the Sheriffs Army increa&s;ed daily, and had Plundered a very rich City, in which were great Quantities of Rich Goods of all &s;orts, and that this Army lived under exact Di&s;ci|pline; the which Army (as was reported) was divided into two Parts, one Divi&s;ion remained with the Sheriff, and lay En|camped between <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Medina;</HI> and another part of this Army was encamped in the Province, or Kingdom of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> where they made Head again&s;t tho&s;e Pa|&s;ha's which were Con&s;tituted by the Sul|tan, endeavouring to ob&s;truct all tho&s;e Ways leading to <HI>Aleppo.</HI> The News hereof did not a little trouble the Mind of the Grand Seignior, and &s;erved to increa&s;e his Di&s;ea&s;e of the Drop&s;ie, which had been very fatal to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Family; how&s;o|ever a certain famous Phy&s;ician gave hopes of his Recovery, pretending to Cure him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan <HI>Achmet</HI> in danger of Death.</NOTE> by opening four I&s;&s;ues in his Legs and Feet; but an acute Fever coming there|upon, People began to de&s;pair of his Life, which cau&s;ed a great Silence in all Parts, particularly in the Army in <HI>Hungary,</HI> where it was reported, That the Sultan was Dead, or out of all hopes of Recove|ry; be&s;ides which, all things went ill for the <HI>Turks,</HI> for the three Pa&s;ha's which were di&s;patched from <HI>Sofia</HI> to receive Taxes from the <HI>Venetians,</HI> not far from <HI>Narenta,</HI> returned back without Contributions to|wards the War; which &s;o grievou&s;ly trou|bled the Grand Vizier, that he di&s;patched away three other Beyes with a good De|tachment of the <HI>Albanian</HI> Militia, to force and collect his Taxes. And tho' the <HI>Turks</HI> put a good Face on their Misfortunes; yet the Villanous Rebels, and Tumultuous Robbers in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> continued their Outrages, &s;o that nothing came from thence, but Complaints and Unhappy Tydings: All the force that they could make, or expect from thence, was no more than the Yearly Succours for guard of the Ca&s;tles upon the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> together with three Pa&s;ha's, and two Beys, making in all 3600 Men appointed for Recruits for the Grand Vi|zier.</P>
<P>To add farther to all the&s;e Misfortunes Advices were carried to all Places, That the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet was arrived before <HI>Myti|lene</HI> with 30 Gallies, four Gallea&s;&s;es, 12 Ships of War, on which were Shipped 15000 Soldiers, the greate&s;t part of which con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Albanians, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Sclavo|nians.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover farther intelligence came from <HI>Salonica,</HI> or <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> That they greatly feared the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet, which threatned to make a De&s;cent within that Gulf, and were in &s;ome apprehen&s;ions lea&s;t the Ene|my &s;hould make an attempt on the I&s;land of <HI>Scio.</HI></P>

<P>On the 13th, the firing both by Water and by Land, was again renewed: The Attack made by the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;eeming to be a formal Seige both of <HI>Peter Waradin,</HI> and of the Imperial Camp; they having either on their Ships, or Batteries, upwards of 500 Great Guns continually firing, tho' with little damage to the <HI>Germans:</HI> The De&s;ign of the <HI>Turks</HI> being to ruine the Im|perial Bridge.</P>

<P>Whil&s;t all People were attentive to hear him, two Aga's belonging to the Chima|cam, being near the Gate of the Mo&s;ch, and over-hearing the Di&s;cour&s;e, run away with it to the Chimacam their Ma&s;ter; who immediately without any delay, or &s;top, in a trembling manner mounted on Hor&s;eback, and taking with him his Ser|vants, Officers, and Jani&s;aries all Armed, and Commanded by the Lieutenant-Gene|ral of the Jani&s;aries, ran to the Mo&s;ch, and made this Seditious Preacher to be &s;eized, which cau&s;ed great Confu&s;ion and Noi&s;e through the whole City; for appea&s;ing which, the Chimacam took a large Turn through all the High Streets of <HI>Adriano|ple.</HI></P>
<P>At that time it happened that a certain Pa&s;ha arrived within a few Hours of <HI>Adri|anople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> who had been Bani&s;hed by Com|mand of the Sultan, for many Robberies and Thefts he had committed in the Pub|lick Trea&s;ury; his Name was <HI>Benli Hu|&s;aein</HI> Pa&s;ha, who&s;e Head he took off; as he did in like manner, and at the &s;ame time the Head of one <HI>Mu&s;a</HI> Aga, and threw them both into the fir&s;t Court-yard of the Se|raglio, before the Gate of the <HI>Divan,</HI> de|claring that the&s;e two were of the Seditious Mutineers, who had rai&s;ed the Tumult in the City, which terrified a little for the pre&s;ent; which when the Chimacam per|ceived, he was encouraged to proceed, and took 11 Officers, who were Ring-lead|ers of the Sedition, who&s;e Heads were heaped up together before the Divan-Door, and their Bodies thrown into the Cannels in divers parts of the City: A|mong&s;t the&s;e, was an Officer of the Grand Seignior's Stables, called <HI>Bekir Aga,</HI> a Talking, Mutinous Fellow; as al&s;o a Fool|i&s;h A&s;trologer, with 22 others, who were one Night all Strangled, and their Bodies thrown into the River <HI>Tongi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sedition quelled.</NOTE> (which runs near to the Grand Seignior's Palace at <HI>A|drianople</HI>) and in this manner the Chima|cam prevented a Mutiny, and qua&s;hed a Rebellion which was ri&s;ing to a dangerous height: How&s;oever the People murmured, but dur&s;t not &s;peak &s;o Audaciou&s;ly as be|fore.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Tumults were over at <HI>Adri|anople,</HI> People began to di&s;cour&s;e of Prodi|gies, &s;trange Sights, and Apparitions; and among others, a Report was at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> That an Owl was &s;een at Noon-day, &s;itting on the Old Pyramid in the Market-place; which as was reported, fell down of it &s;elf that Night, and next Morning there was found within the Ba&s;is of the Pyramid, a piece of Wax, on which was in&s;cribed in <HI>Greek</HI> Characters, the&s;e Words.</P>

<P>All the&s;e Stories and Reports being ag|gravated to the Grand Seignior, put him into a grievous Affrightment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan &s;ends in ha&s;te for the Grand Vizier.</NOTE> &s;o that in all ha&s;te he di&s;patched Po&s;ts one after the o|ther to fetch the Grand Vizier from <HI>Bel|grade</HI> to <HI>Adrianople;</HI> but how&s;oever he would not move until fir&s;t he had &s;upplied <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> with all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions; for want of which the <HI>Turks</HI> died of Fluxes, and all &s;orts of Camp Di&s;ea&s;es; and lying

<P>By the&s;e means the whole <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ar|my was reduced to 30000 fighting Men; to repair which, and make the Numbers to &s;eem a little more formidable, they for|ced, and Pre&s;&s;ed about 10000 Arti&s;ans and Country Men, Raw, and Unexperienced Fellows, to make a Shew of, which had they mo&s;t died, the World would &s;carce have mi&s;&s;ed them, only the <HI>Albanians,</HI> a Stout and Valiant People, were to be la|mented, of which not one half returned in|to their own Country.</P>
<P>The Mufti and others growing &s;en&s;ible of their Low and Mi&s;erable Condition, and overwhelmed on all &s;ides by Enemies, by Sickne&s;&s;es, by Famine, and Poverty, wrote a Letter to the Scheriff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mufti's Letter to the Scheriff</NOTE> exhorting him to Peace, at &s;uch a time as this is, when the Enemies to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Cau&s;e over|whelmed them in all Parts; declaring, That without betraying the Mu&s;&s;elman Cau&s;e, they could not per&s;i&s;t in their Wars again&s;t the Sultan; and therefore they exhorted them to retire into their own Dominions, and to live quietly there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letters to Exhort the Scheriff to Peace.</NOTE> rather than to expo&s;e the Holy Religion to the In&s;ults of Infidels.</P>
<P>By this Letter, and other Advices, which were &s;econded by many Exhortations of the Religious, and Holy Seighs, or Preachers, in their re&s;pective Mona&s;teries, the Scheriff &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat ap|pea&s;ed, and to relent a little of his re|vengeful Humour again&s;t the <HI>Turks:</HI> Be|&s;ides the meaner Princes of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who are the mo&s;t Religious, and Super&s;ti|tious of all the others, falling off from the Alliance with the Scheriff, on the &s;core of Religion, things became more quiet in <HI>A|rabia,</HI> and gave the <HI>Turks</HI> le&s;s Fears, and Apprehen&s;ions than before.</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>Calailicos Ahmet Pa&s;ha,</HI> a cun|ning Sophi&s;ter (of whom we gave lately an Account) having been &s;ent from <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> with &s;ome Forces again&s;t the Scheriff, changed his Method from Arms, to Epi&s;tles, Sermons, and Exhortations, per&s;wading him, that &s;ince he &s;aw &s;o many Martyrs on all &s;ides, Dying for the <HI>Maho|metan</HI> Cau&s;e, that he &s;hould not add to the Slaughter of the Mu&s;&s;elmen, nor joyn with Infidels to the De&s;truction of the True Faith.</P>
<P>To the&s;e were added al&s;o divers Letters from other Pa&s;ha's, as al&s;o from Mulla's, Seighs, and Cadi's of the mo&s;t e&s;teem in <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> which &s;o prevailed upon the Mind of the Scheriff, that he for &s;ome time de&s;i&s;ted from all Ho&s;tilities upon the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, the Ea&s;tern Princes bordering on <HI>Arabia,</HI> were a little cautious how they tru&s;ted the &s;incerity of the Scheriff; for in de&s;pight of all his fair Words, they would not be decoyed to leave their Country open, and expo&s;ed to the Mercy of the <HI>I&s;hmaelites,</HI> a People that never kept Faith; &s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> recei|ved no more Forces from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the follow|ing Year, than they had done in this pre|&s;ent, by rea&s;on of the Jealou&s;ie they con|ceived of the <HI>Arabians.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;&s;ing De&s;ires of the Sultan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vizier delays his return.</NOTE> to ha&s;ten the return of his Vi|zier, he made his Excu&s;es to delay his Journey; alledging, That Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> had been reinforced by con&s;iderable Re|cruits, and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve his Motions; that the Floods by the Land-Waters, cau&s;ed by perpetual Rains, made it impo&s;&s;ible for the Army to march without Hard&s;hips, and un&s;uppor|table Labours: But at length the old Year drawing towards an end, and it becoming nece&s;&s;ary to provide for the Actions, Wars, and Coun&s;els of the New, the Vizier was forced to leave the Army; which he did with great ha&s;te, and arrived before <HI>Adri|anople</HI> about the 8th or 10th of <HI>December;</HI> where he remained under his Tents, ma|king a &s;how as if he intended to march in|to the <HI>Morea,</HI> with intention to recover <HI>Scio;</HI> but before this De&s;ign was re&s;olved, a Conference was held in the Vizier's Tents, where the Mufti was pre&s;ent; af|ter which the Chimacam was called, as al|&s;o the Aga of the Jani&s;aries, and the Aga of the Spahee's, with divers other Offi|cers, who returned back with the Grand Vizier; at which A&s;&s;embly it was conclu|ded, That by rea&s;on of the urgency of the Times, and that the Imperiali&s;ts were chief|ly to be attended, as being the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Party, the Grand Vizier &s;hould remain at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to rai&s;e new Forces, and prepare for the Wars of the following Year.

<P>The Sultan being &s;en&s;ible that his Peo|ple were become much di&s;heartned and weakned by the many Misfortunes and Troubles which they had &s;u&s;tained, gave Orders to the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> named <HI>Mu&s;tapha Pa&s;ha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The good Qualities of <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha Pa&s;ha.</HI></NOTE> to treat the People with Kindne&s;s and Civility: This Chima|cam was a prudent Per&s;on, and being a lo|ver of Ju&s;tice, and tender of the Welfare of the People, was e&s;teemed and well &s;poken of by all; and having known Mi&s;eries and Hard&s;hips during the time that he had undergone a Slavery in <HI>Poland,</HI> he knew the better how to commi&s;erate the Afflicti|ons of others: But above all, as Matters &s;tood now in the&s;e Times, the great Con|cern of a Chief Governour was to prevent Tumults and In&s;urrections of the People; of the danger of which the late Di&s;turban|ces had given a pregnant Example, and &s;o moved the Spirit of the Chimacam to pro&s;e|cute the Offenders, that 315 were put to Death at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> for the afore&s;aid Se|dition; and &s;ix of the principal Officers being forced to fly to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were there taken, and being put into Sacks, were &s;trangled, and after the Ancient Fa|&s;hion thrown into the Sea; the which had been among&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> the Puni&s;hment for Parricides,

<P>When the Grand Seignior Ve&s;ted him, as is commonly done by every Sultan at his Inauguration;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> his Saying.</NOTE> he told him, <Q>That he &s;hould be careful what he did, that he &s;hould treat his Soldiers well, and above all, that he be &s;ure to tell him the truth; and if not, he &s;hould &s;oon know and be &s;en&s;ible of what would follow:</Q> But &s;ince this Severity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan's Humour.</NOTE> and &s;harp Saying, he re|mitted &s;omething of his Angry Temper, and became more mild and ea&s;ie; &s;o that to encourage and rai&s;e his Spirit a little, he &s;ent his Kuzlir-Aga in Ceremony with a great Attendance, to carry to the Grand Vizier a Prayer, which he him&s;elf had compo&s;ed in the time of his Solitude, and Seclu&s;ion from the World, which were re|ceived with profound Re&s;pect; the Bearer him&s;elf had five Pur&s;es pre&s;ented to him, and the Chief of his Attendants was treat|ed with &s;everal Rich Ve&s;ts, and the others of meaner Degree had a good number of Zaichins di&s;tributed among&s;t them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> The Grand Seignior al&s;o would not want his own Pre&s;ent, which was in Hor&s;es, and Jewels, &s;everal Young Dam&s;els, richly a|dorned, with above 100 Pur&s;es of Mo|ney; and yet for all this the Vizier thought not him&s;elf &s;afe, nor did the bitter Thoughts of Death pa&s;s from him: for whil&s;t he was trembling for him&s;elf, he received a Hatte-&s;heriff, or a Royal Command from the Hand of the Grand Seignior, requiring him to command the Chiaus Pa&s;ha to Arre&s;t the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> the Vizier's own chief Creature and Confident, and to put him between the Gates, a Pri&s;on for great Per&s;onages: The Fault objected to his Charge was, That in the time of the late Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> he had put to Death two of this pre&s;ent Sultan's Favourites, for en|deavouring to promote the Intere&s;t of their Ma&s;ter, to the Prejudice of the Ruling Prince. Notwith&s;tanding all which Mor|tifying Commands, and Accidents, the Grand Vizier appeared outwardly with a chearful Countenance, for the lea&s;t Sad|ne&s;s would have been interpreted for Con|tumacy, and a Di&s;contented Spirit a|gain&s;t the Commands and Plea&s;ure of his Ma&s;ter; for which rea&s;on he bore up brave|ly again&s;t all Misfortunes, concealing the Agitations of his Mind from all tho&s;e who had Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, and even from his own Dome&s;ticks.</P>
<P>At this time my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor from His Maje&s;ty King <HI>William,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Paget</HI> at <HI>Adri|anople.</HI></NOTE> was then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> watching an Opportu|nity to make Propo&s;als for a Peace with the Emperor, of which, tho' about the lat|ter time of Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> there was a great and a fair appearance; yet after his Decea&s;e this young Sultan mounting the Throne, all the hopes vani&s;hed, he him|&s;elf being of a hot and fiery Spirit, was fully re&s;olved to try his Fortune in the War, from which De&s;ign neither his Mo|ther, nor his Women, nor his greate&s;t Fa|vourites could divert them. And the Kiah-Bey him&s;elf, who was Lieutenant-General, of the Jani&s;aries, a Per&s;on of great E&s;teem, and Power in the Army, was di&s;graced, and put out of Office, for arguing in the Divan again&s;t the Grand Seignior's taking ths Field this Year in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e Changes had di&s;concerted all the Mea&s;ures which my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> had taken towards a Peace, of which there now re|mained no hopes for this Year; for the Sultan was not to be removed from his Re|&s;olution, nor the Soldiery aver&s;e to it, ha|ving fixed it in their Minds, that this Sul|tan was Lucky and Fortunate, and was to re&s;tore all that had been lo&s;t, &s;ince the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and the fatal Managements of the Grand Vizier <HI>Kara Mu&s;tapha.</HI> And to this purpo&s;e the Grand Seignior di&s;cour|&s;ing with the Vizier, he told him, how &s;en&s;i|ble he was of the evil management of Af|fairs in the Empire, and that they were much wor&s;e than they had been in the time of his Father; to re&s;tore which to a better Condition, he again declared his Re&s;olu|tion to try his Fortune for another Year; the which not &s;ucceeding well, he was of an Opinion, That he could at any time make a Truce with the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which perhaps he might be inclined to accept next Year, not out of a Nece&s;&s;ity thereof, but in con&s;ideration to his People, to whom, after a long War of 17 or 18 Years, he was glad to give Ea&s;e and Quiet; for he was &s;en&s;ible, that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire was in great Di&s;order, by rea&s;on of the Igno|rance, Negligence, and ill Admini&s;tration of &s;ome of the principal Mini&s;ters of State, which he would make it his Care to re|medy.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Re&s;olutions of the Sultan, all things were preparing to take the Field early with a &s;trong Army; it being di|vulged, and publi&s;hed among&s;t the Sol|diery, that their fir&s;t March &s;hould be to|wards

<P>To the&s;e good Fortunes of the Sultan, the News was added by way of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> of a great Victory that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had obtained again&s;t the <HI>Poles;</HI> which with the Succe&s;&s;es the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Pa&s;ha's had ob|tained again&s;t the Rebels in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> put all things at the Port into a &s;miling Conditi|on, no Man doubting, but that the influ|ence of the&s;e pro&s;perous Beginnings would crown all the Actions of this New Sultan, with Succe&s;s and Victory.</P>

<P>WE have not only in the Sea&s;on of the la&s;t Spring, but during the whole Summer, and Autumn, lived in continual Alarms, and Skirmi&s;hes with our Enemies, but even in this very Win|ter been engaged with them in divers Bloody Fights: And particularly on the 11th of this Month of <HI>February,</HI> a Bat|tle was made between 3000 of our Sol|diers, again&s;t 70000 <HI>Tartars,</HI> within the Suburbs, and under the Walls of <HI>Leo|polis:</HI> The Particulars of which, are the&s;e.</P>

<P>The Day following about Eight of the Clock in the Morning, the Sultan <HI>Tartar</HI> drew out his Men into form of Battle; and I al&s;o having my Confidence in God, drew out that Handful of Men which I had with me, and made a Sally out of the City to cover the Suburbs. The Enemy &s;taid not long to look on us, but &s;eeing &s;ome <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Companies to march boldly again&s;t them, they Detached a Party of <HI>Tartars</HI> to meet and engage them, and to force the Outworks, which were only for|tified with Hedges, and a kind of Wall made up with Mats and Ru&s;hes well wo|ven together. This Command was exe|cuted with &s;uch Vigour, that doubtle&s;s the Place had been carried at the fir&s;t At|tack, had not the danger wherein they were of lo&s;ing their Lives, and E&s;tates, and all they had, made them de&s;perate,
<PB N="525" REF="289"> and forced them to make all the re&s;i&s;tance that they were able; and in effect they fought like Lyons, receiving the Enemy &s;o bravely, that in a &s;hort time all the Fields were covered with the Dead Bodies of the Slain.

<P>This Fight continued four Hours, un|til at length the Enemy ob&s;erving that all their A&s;&s;aults prevailed little, but were very Bloody, and of great lo&s;s, they re|&s;olved, That at the &s;ame time, when they engaged us in the Front with one Party, they &s;hould break in upon the Hedge with another, and whatever lo&s;s, or Blood it &s;hould co&s;t, to carry it by main force, as it immediately proved; for the Enemy having by this means got between us and the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> beaten.</NOTE> we remained without any hopes imaginable of relief; how&s;oever with a Courage full of re&s;olution to overcome, or die like Brave Men, turning our Faces upon them, to whom we had but newly turned our Backs, we did not only over|come them, but cut a great Number of them in pieces; and after another Engage|ment, which la&s;ted about two Hours more, drove them out of the Suburbs of the City; tho' in the time of this Fight, the <HI>Tartars</HI> having &s;et Fire thereunto, the Wind, and Smoak, and Du&s;t did &s;o in|commode our People, that they were in a manner Blinded, and knew not which cour&s;e to take; how&s;oever their Invinci|ble Courage was &s;uch, as that the Enemy was put to Flight.</P>
<P> This Fight continued until Three a Clock in the Afternoon, by which time they had been &s;o beaten, that they were forced to withdraw before the Evening, about a League and a half from the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tar|tars</HI> with|draw.</NOTE> and the next Day proceeded on their March; and the third Day pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Nei&s;ter,</HI> on their way homewards.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e who were again&s;t the Grand Seignior's going in Per&s;on to the War, pre&s;|&s;ed very hard the prevailing Argument of want of Money, to rai&s;e which, all means po&s;&s;ible were contrived; for the Sultan would not be put by his Re&s;olution, al|ledging, That the Negligence of his Fa|ther and Unkle's not going to War in Per|&s;on, had been the Ruine of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, and the Cau&s;e of all tho&s;e Lo&s;&s;es, and Di&s;graces which his Empire had &s;u|&s;tained; but Money mu&s;t be found by one way or other; to do which, the Grand Vizier was &s;trictly enjoyned to give an Account of Eighteen Millions in the &s;pace of Thirty Days, be&s;ides the Arrears due
<PB N="528" REF="291"> to the Soldiery, in the Time of the la&s;t Sultan <HI>Achmet:</HI> And tho' the Grand Vizier alledged, That it &s;eemed rea&s;onable, that &s;uch as had managed the Publick Offices during the two preceding Reigns, &s;hould be an&s;werable for the Mi&s;carriages, and not he, who had been employed therein but only &s;ome few Months before; yet the Sultan would not admit of this Excu&s;e for a Rea&s;on, but required the Account of the Eighteen Millions: His Mother al&s;o furni&s;hed her Son with Seven Millions and a half in ready Money, and Fifteen Mil|lions in Jewels, which &s;he had been colle|cting in the &s;pace of fifteen Years that &s;he had been the Wife of his Father; and from the Widow of the late Decea&s;ed Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> they took another half Million; the Vizier was Taxed at a Million and a half, and five Millions in Jewels; likewi&s;e a good round Sum was demanded from the Chimacam, and other Pa&s;ha's and Per&s;ons in great Offices.</P>
<P>There was a farther Propo&s;ition made to &s;crew Money out of all the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and Negro's at Court: The Kuzlir-Aga was the fir&s;t of that Rank from whom the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Sums were exacted; to pay which, their E&s;tates and Faculties &s;ent and conveyed out of &s;ight to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were all called from thence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> The like was al&s;o demanded from the <HI>Ulema,</HI> and all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Lands and E&s;tates were Taxed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Per&s;ons Taxed.</NOTE></P>
<P>To execute all the&s;e Contrivances and Ways for rai&s;ing Money, the Grand Seig|nior was &s;olely intent, labouring Day and Night to ama&s;s Money; and &s;pent his whole time to heap up Riches; to do which, he acted many things without the knowledge of the Vizier, and wrote Let|ters, and received An&s;wers relating to the rai&s;ing Men, and providing Sub&s;i&s;tence for the Troops without intere&s;ting his Grand Vizier therein; the which &s;truck &s;uch a Fear and Terrour into the Minds of all tho&s;e who had to do with the Publick In|tere&s;t, that none dur&s;t to act any thing privately, or in an ob&s;cure manner, which might be of prejudice to the Grand Seig|nior, and his Government.</P>
<P>To keep this Sultan in the Humour of going to the War, his Mother laboured to keep up his Spirits; which being ob&s;erved by the great Men, &s;uch as the Mufti, the Grand Vizier, the Lord Trea&s;urer, and the Generals of the Jani&s;aries, and of the Spa|hees, they all &s;ubmitted thereunto, only they gave in a Petition to be delivered to the Sultan by the Hand of the Valide Sol|tana, or Queen-Mother; repre&s;enting, That &s;ince they had ob&s;erved that it was His Maje&s;ty's Re&s;olution to go in Per&s;on to the War, they were concurring with him in the &s;ame, promi&s;ing to be helpful therein to the be&s;t of their Powers; be|&s;eeching only, That His <HI>Ottoman</HI> Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to Indulge them &s;o much time, as might &s;erve to a&s;&s;emble, and ga|ther their Militia into a Body, and to make Provi&s;ions for their Sub&s;i&s;tence, as al&s;o Ammunition, and Cannon, with Pow|der and Bullet &s;ufficient to attend &s;o great an Army: Of all which they gave the Sultan in Writing a particular Account in what forwardne&s;s all things were; and concluded, That &s;ince it is the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Germans</HI> to be late in the Field, they did not doubt but to be more forward than they, and to Grace and Honour the Sul|tan's fir&s;t Expedition with the Succe&s;s of Glorious Atchievements, of which the Mi&s;carriage would prove of evil Con&s;e|quence, as the contrary would be of migh|ty advantage to the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which langui&s;hing after a Fortunate Sultan, would then think the Wheel turned in ca&s;e they could &s;ee the end of a Campaign con|cluded with Honour of a New Sultan.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignior being &s;en&s;ible here|of, rai&s;ed all the Forces he was able, both in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> And to Engage the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> on his &s;ide, certain Aga's were di&s;patched to <HI>Tartary</HI> with Pur&s;es of Mo|ney, with Pre&s;ents of a Sword richly a|dorned with Diamonds, and with rich Cof|tans; as al&s;o with Pre&s;ents to the other Kin&s;men of the Han, and to the Mirzees, who are the Noble Men, and Chief Offi|cers both of War and Peace, de&s;iring them all to be early at the War; by which great A&s;&s;iduity of the Sultan, all the Great Of|ficers were in fear of him, knowing that as he Rewarded generou&s;ly, &s;o he Puni&s;h|ed &s;everely.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier in the mean time con&s;idering the Troubles under which he was to labour, as al&s;o the Invincible Diffi|culties of the pre&s;ent War, in ca&s;e the Sultan &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in his Re&s;olution of going in Per&s;on to Command the Army, he endeavoured what he could to obtain the Favour that he might lay down his Of|fice, and quietly and &s;afely retire from all Bu&s;ine&s;s; for which he made Talki&s;h to the Grand Seignior, which is a Petition made by the Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts; (of which there is but one belonging to the Court called <HI>Talki&s;hgee</HI>) the &s;ub&s;tance of which was to lay before the Grand Seignior the impo&s;&s;ibility of making the Donative to the Soldiers, amounting unto Twelve Mil|lions, the which was always given by the Sultans to the Soldiers, when&s;oever they
<PB N="529" REF="291"> made their fir&s;t Campaign: This was &s;o rea&s;onable an Exception, and Excu&s;e, that there was no reply to be made thereunto, but the ab&s;olute Will and Plea&s;ure not to pay it; for be&s;ides the want of Money in the Trea&s;ury, which had been exhau&s;ted by a long and an unfortunate War, the Grand Seignior added, That he did not e&s;teem him&s;elf obliged to a Cu&s;tom which was begun in the mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing Times of the Empire, when Succe&s;s crowned all their Enterprizes with Victory, when the Ene|mies were forced to pay all Charges of the War, with an Overplus of Riches and In|crea&s;e, which filled the Royal Exchequer, and that Wars maintained the Empire: But tho&s;e Days, added the Grand Seig|nior, are now pa&s;t; and that it would be an In&s;olence in the Soldiery, to expect a Donative from him, who was not in the lea&s;t beholding to them for his being pla|ced in the Throne, to which he came by Succe&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Donative refu&s;ed to the Soldiers.</NOTE> and a Ju&s;t Title, and not by the Favour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Soldiery; and that who&s;oever had oppo&s;ed him there|in (who was their True and Lawful So|veraign) would have been guilty of High-Trea&s;on, and ought to Die by the Ju&s;t Laws of the Empire.</P>
<P>In this manner, the Wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t Ex|perienced Officers ob&s;erving how difficult, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible it was to divert the Grand Seignior from his Re&s;olution of go|ing in Per&s;on to the War, they all agreed to joyn with their Ma&s;ter, and to applaud his happy De&s;igns, which they prayed to God might be pro&s;perous, promi&s;ing to give all A&s;&s;i&s;tance with their Lives and For|tunes, that he might return with Victory and Succe&s;s: So &s;oon were their Minds changed to the Will and Plea&s;ure of their Ab&s;olute and Uncontroulable Lord, that none dur&s;t open his Mouth again&s;t his Determination, nor no Murmurings heard unle&s;s by &s;ome few Jani&s;aries, who Talked a little, without any Notice ta|ken thereof.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier finding him&s;elf al&s;o under Invincible Difficulties, thought it the &s;afe&s;t way to clo&s;e with the Sultan, which he accordingly did, and with much outward Zeal di&s;&s;embled a Chear|fulne&s;s of Spirit in Compliance with his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This Matter being re&s;olved, it was con|cluded, That an Army &s;hould be formed of 80000 Fighting Men, and the Tugh, or Hor&s;e-Tail, being with Prayers, after the u&s;ual manner, expo&s;ed at the Vizier's Gate, the 30th of <HI>March</HI> was appointed to take the Field, and enter the Tents, which are commonly pitched about two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles di&s;tant from the Gates: And the Grand Seignior to lo&s;e no time, Commanded that 2000 of his Pages, and as many others on Hor&s;eback, appointed for his Guard, &s;hould be at the appointed time in a readine&s;s to attend the Sultan: But yet things went but &s;lowly on, by rea|&s;on of the great Di&s;cords ari&s;en in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Retard|ments to the Motion of the War.</NOTE> whereby many of the Chief Men had been killed, which gave a &s;top to the March of the Militia.</P>
<P>To which al&s;o another &s;top was given by the News which the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> re|ceived, That the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> being joyned with the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> was pa&s;&s;ing down the <HI>Tanais,</HI> with de&s;ign to fall upon <HI>A&s;ac;</HI> of which he gave Advice to the Grand Seignior, by an Expre&s;s di&s;patch|ed to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> acquainting him, That the Enemies were grown &s;o numerous, that he could not this Year &s;end his Troops to <HI>Hungary,</HI> having hard Work to defend his own Country, and People, from &s;o nu|merous an Army as that of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> joyned with the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks.</HI> But the Grand Seignior not &s;atisfied with this Excu&s;e, re|turned an An&s;wer, That notwith&s;tanding all Impediments to the contrary, he mu&s;t by all means come with a Numerous Army, and appear in his Pre&s;ence; but this was impo&s;&s;ible to be done, the Soldiers and People not being contented to plea&s;e the Grand Seignior to &s;ee their Country laid open, and expo&s;ed to &s;uch a Powerful E|nemy.</P>
<P>This Grand Seignior Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> when he came fir&s;t to the Throne, was Feared, E&s;teemed, Loved, and Obeyed; but the Affection of his People was &s;oon e&s;tranged from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mufti Depo&s;ed, the Vizier Strangled.</NOTE> &s;ince he Depo&s;ed the late Mufti, and cau&s;ed the Grand Vizier, with many other Per&s;ons, Innocent and Worthy, to be Strangled, with Ignominy and Di&s;honour. But the Mufti was mo&s;t of all lamented, having the Reputation of a Ju&s;t, Sincere, Hone&s;t, and a Holy Man, in who&s;e place the Sultan e&s;tabli&s;hed his late Hogia, or School-Ma&s;ter, named <HI>Fei|zulah Effendi,</HI> a Wicked, Fal&s;e, Perfidious, and Covetous Wretch, as he was general|ly e&s;teemed to be.</P>
<P>The Grand Vizier, (as we have &s;aid) was always affraid of the Changeable Hu|mour of the Sultan, and could not cover his Pa&s;&s;ion, nor di&s;&s;emble his Countenance; of which the Sultan taking notice, depri|ved him of his Office, and Bani&s;hed him at Midnight to <HI>Chi&s;me,</HI> which is a &s;mall Vil|lage on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Anatolia</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Scio;</HI> but this Pro&s;cription continued not long, before he was brought back again to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and Strangled, and his Body

<P>At <HI>Adrianople</HI> all the Court was chang|ed; only the Grand Seignior when he fir&s;t entered upon the Throne, confirmed the Jani&s;ar-Aga in his Place, who was an Ho|ne&s;t Man, and a good Soldier, but &s;oon afterwards he put him out, and Con&s;titu|ted another in his Place, called <HI>Baltag&eacute;e Deli,</HI> which &s;ignifies Mad Battle-Axe Man, the Son of an <HI>Armenian Renegade,</HI> a Vile Fellow, without Sence, or Manners: Like|wi&s;e the Kahya-Bey, or Lieutenant-Ge|neral of the Jani&s;aries; and the Kuzlir-Aga, or Eunuch of the Women were di&s;|placed; and in &s;hort &s;ince this Sultan came to the Throne, there was nothing done but placing and di&s;placing of the Principal Officers; all which was acted by the Coun|&s;els of Women, and Favourites in the Se|raglio, who neither had Sence, nor Expe|rience in the Affairs of the World. The like &s;oon after happened to the Chimacam, who being a Friend to the late Vizier, and one of his Creatures, was Bani&s;hed fir&s;t to <HI>Mytilene,</HI> where he was likewi&s;e Stran|gled; from whence his Head being brought to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> was thrown before the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Seraglio, with divers others e&s;teem|ed Innocent by the People.</P>
<P>Thus the Sultan, as he thought, having purged his Army of Cowards, and his Coun&s;els of Ill-affected Mini&s;ters, began his March from <HI>Adrianople</HI> on the 10th of <HI>June;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> the Jani&s;ar-Aga marched away on the 3d: The Army was &s;aid to be very powerful, and compo&s;ed of Choice Men, which &s;o encouraged the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they talked of nothing le&s;s than the taking of <HI>Buda;</HI> and about that time News came from <HI>Stalida de Zetuns,</HI> a &s;mall I&s;land near <HI>Negropont,</HI> That <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> Pa&s;ha of that I&s;land, had entered into the <HI>Morea</HI> with 30000 Men, and was Encamped under <HI>Corinth,</HI> expecting the Captain-Pa&s;ha, who was then de&s;igning to depart from <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> in ten Days, where he had been detained longer than was u&s;ual, to repair the Damages which the <HI>Turks</HI> had received in their late Engagement again&s;t the <HI>Vene|tians:</HI> Belonging to this Fleet, &s;even Ships were appointed for <HI>Alexandria</HI> to fetch Soldiers thence for the <HI>Morea;</HI> and like|wi&s;e about this time Recruits were &s;ent to the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> to &s;everal Ports there, the <HI>Turks</HI> being in fear of the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> who being very &s;trong, the <HI>Tartars</HI> were affraid to encounter them, and would have ex|cu&s;ed them&s;elves this Year from the War, but the Sultan would not hearken there|unto, but proceeded with Re&s;olution on his March.</P>
<P>But before the Sultan began the &s;ame, he cau&s;ed the <HI>Tallol,</HI> or Common-Cryer, to make Publication, That the Grand Seignior's Will and Plea&s;ure was,</P>
<P><Q>That no Man going to the Wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Or|ders for the Army.</NOTE> &s;hould be &s;erved by Young Boys.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That good Order and Di&s;cipline &s;hould be ob&s;erved in the March.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That no Man &s;hould ride out of the Common High-Road, or by Bye-Ways, into the Corn-Fields, or Vine-yards, or other Grounds belonging to the Hus|band-Man.</Q></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e Commands, the Sultan on the very Day that he departed from the Camp before <HI>Adrianople,</HI> being then Teptil, or in Di&s;gui&s;e, he found a Man cutting another's Corn to give his Hor&s;e; and only asking him, Whether he had heard of the Grand Seignior's Com|mand? He ordered the Selictar-Aga, who was General of the Spahee's, for he had no other with him (excepting the Kapugi|ler-Kahya&s;e) at the &s;ame time to kill him, which he pre&s;ently executed with his Lan|cet, not giving the Unhappy Wretch one Moment to &s;peak for his Life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignior's Severities.</NOTE> At the &s;ame time al&s;o, the Grand Seignior e&s;pyed another walking through the Corn, whom he took and carried to the Tents, where he cau&s;ed his Head to be cut off. The Topgiba&s;hee, or Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, likewi&s;e the Day or two before very hard|ly e&s;caped; for having a Boy in his Com|pany, of whom the Grand Seignior had &s;ome Jealou&s;ie, or ill Thoughts, had cer|tainly been put to Death for the &s;ame, had he not had &s;ome pre&s;ent Witne&s;&s;es at hand to prove him to be his Son.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch like Acts of Severity, rendered this Sultan very formidable, &s;o that all People were afraid of him, not on|ly in their Publick Actions, but even in their Private Conver&s;ation, &s;carce tru&s;ting their own Thoughts. Among&s;t the&s;e Se|verities <HI>Achmet Pa&s;ha,</HI> late Chimacam to Sultan <HI>Achmet,</HI> was turn'd out of his Of|fice by this pre&s;ent Sultan, and Bani&s;hed to <HI>Mytilene;</HI> and after having taken from him an hundred Pur&s;es of Money, his Head was brought to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> about two Days after the Vizier had been Stran|gled.</P>
<P>All things being now prepared for the March of the Army towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the Jani&s;ar-Aga with his Jani&s;aries, according
<PB N="531" REF="292"> to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom took the Van, and marched away one Days March before the re&s;t of the Army, &s;o that the Grand Seig|nior, attended by the Mufti, Grand Vi|zier, Spahilar-Aga, or General of the Spa|hees, Tefterdar, or Lord-Trea&s;urer, be|gan their March, following the Jani&s;aries, on the 20th of <HI>June,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> but after &s;ome few Hours, they made a Halt to give time to three of the greate&s;t Pa&s;has, or Begler|beys of the Empire, to come up with them; that is to &s;ay, to the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Da|ma&s;cus,</HI> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and Beglerbey of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> every one of which brought with him about 1200 Men, recounting Spahees, and Sarigiaus, and Segmen on Hor&s;eback, with all which and others at|tending the Sultan in his March, they did not amount to more than 12000 Hor&s;e, with which he marched from <HI>Adrianople</HI> in &s;ix Days to <HI>Philippopolis,</HI> and Encamped o|ver again&s;t that City in tho&s;e Plains, where a great Council of War was held, touch|ing the Methods which were to be ob&s;er|ved in the War, and the Places which were to be Attacked.</P>
<P>The Numbers of this Army appeared &s;o &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, that the Sultan remained very much un&s;atisfied, and would not be contented, unle&s;s the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> would follow him with all his Force unto the Camp at <HI>Belgrade;</HI> but he po&s;itively refu&s;ed it; and &s;aid, That it could not be done; unle&s;s he &s;hould expo&s;e, and lay his People open to the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI> who were coming down in va&s;t Numbers to over-run all the Regions of the <HI>Tartars:</HI> How&s;oever not to di&s;plea&s;e overmuch the Grand Seignior, the <HI>Tartar Han</HI> forced him&s;elf to appear in the <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Camp with an Army of about 5000 <HI>Tartars,</HI> which was a good addition to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Force, &s;o that in all they compo&s;ed an Army of about 50000 Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army led by the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> was not much &s;tronger, but ve|ry de&s;irous to meet the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had taken their March towards <HI>Tran&s;ylvania:</HI> But in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;o far advan|ced before the Imperial Army, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Elector to come in op|portunely, and in &s;ea&s;on to &s;uccour the Places which the Sultan de&s;igned to Inve&s;t, unle&s;s they could take a &s;horter way, which was offered unto them, being guided by &s;ome of that Country; but the Ways pro|ved &s;o bad, being all Mar&s;hes and Wet Grounds, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s them with the Cannon and heavy Baggage of an Army; &s;o that after great Fatigues of three or four Days Marches, the Ele|ctor was obliged to return back again to his former Camp; and in the mean time the <HI>Turks</HI> had got &s;uch a way before them towards <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for them to be overtaken by the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Army; and having liberty to rove every where without any Oppo&s;ition equal to them, they fell in upon the Palanca of <HI>Lippa</HI> on the 7th of <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Septemb.</NOTE> without Brea&s;t-works, or Parapets, or any Ap|proaches, Defence, or Shelter before them, but only with the Scimiter in their Hands, they Attacked the Palanca at four &s;everal Places, with &s;uch incredible Re&s;olution, that after four Hours Engagement, they took the Place by Storm, and put all to the Sword, excepting only Major <HI>Toldo,</HI> who was Governour of the Place, with &s;ome others of the Principal Officers, whom the <HI>Turks</HI> after their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, re&s;er|ved to carry in Triumph, and to &s;how them to the People at the Port, as one Signal of their Victory.</P>

<P>In the mean time the great Army under the Command of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> advanced &s;o far as <HI>Solnak,</HI> where the Grand Seignior having received intelligence, That the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army was marching towards him, ha&s;tned with all &s;peed for <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> with intention to enter into <HI>Sclavonia:</HI> Upon which the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> made a Halt, and on the 17th marched back, and pitched his Camp about half an Hours di|&s;tance from <HI>Chonad;</HI> and the next Day be|ing the 18th, continued his March as far as <HI>Mokoua.</HI> But whereas Advices came, That the Enemy de&s;igned to enter <HI>Tran&s;yl|vania,</HI> the Elector re&s;olved to &s;end all the Infantry to <HI>Peter Waradin,</HI> whil&s;t he in Per&s;on, marched with the Hor&s;e to op|po&s;e the Enemy, giving Commands to the National Militia of <HI>Sclavonia</HI> to joyn with the <HI>Croats,</HI> to oppo&s;e the Entrance of the <HI>Turks</HI> into that Province: And here it was, that certain Intelligence was given of the Defeat of that Worthy General <HI>Veterani,</HI> and that he was dead of his Wounds; which News was received with much grief of all Brave and Worthy Champions for the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Cau&s;e.</P>

<P>It was the common Opinion at that time of all the well experienced Soldiers, That the Martial Affairs of the Empire, were all very ill managed for that Year: For had the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in&s;tead of Ingul&s;ing them&s;elves among&s;t Mara&s;&s;es and Moori&s;h Grounds unpa&s;&s;able for an Army, in which they lo&s;t &s;ix or &s;even Days, and gave the <HI>Turks</HI> the advantage of marching &s;o many Days before them to <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> and thence to <HI>Lippa,</HI> they had &s;aved the lo&s;s of <HI>Vete|rani</HI> and his Forces at <HI>Lugos,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Titul,</HI> and <HI>Karan&s;ebes,</HI> all which fell that Year for want of good Conduct; for the <HI>Turks</HI> were e&s;teemed not &s;tronger at that time than 40000 Men, and one half of them Raw and Undi&s;ciplined Soldiers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill Conduct of the Impe|rial Army, in <HI>Anno 1695.</HI></NOTE> but the Slowne&s;s, and Negligence of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in that Years Expedition, broke all Mea|&s;ures, as if there had been a Fatality at|tending this Years Actions: For no &s;ooner did the <HI>Turks</HI> under&s;tand that the Imperial Army was marching after them, but being &s;truck with a &s;uddain Con&s;ternation, they Decamped with their whole Army from <HI>Lippa,</HI> more like Cowards flying before the Enemy, than in Order and Po&s;ture of War, marching Day and Night to get in|to <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> before the Enemy could over|take them. But &s;o &s;oon as it was known to the <HI>Turks,</HI> that the Imperial Army was marched to <HI>Segedin,</HI> they took Courage, and gave a &s;top to their precipitate Flight.

<P>Yet afterwards &s;ucceeding quite other|wi&s;e than were expected, all was attribu|ted to the Courage, Wi&s;dom, and Conduct of the Sultan; &s;o that it became a Wonder to the World how it was po&s;&s;ible for a Sul|tan without Experience, who had but new|ly come out from an Impri&s;onment of eight Years, and known nothing yet of War, to be attended with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that all his Army did avow, That his Victories were due to his Valour and Conduct, which gained him a wonderful E&s;teem among&s;t all the great Men of his Empire, both Martial and Civil; the Effect of which was found in the following Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Ho|nour gained by the Sul|tan.</NOTE> when all the Sol|diery being flu&s;hed with Blood and Spoil, came willingly to the War, and &s;truck an Awe and Fear into the Hearts of all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Subjects, believing this Prince to be &s;ent them from God, to re&s;cue them and the Empire from Ruine and utter De|&s;olation.</P>

<P>The Sultan being &s;en&s;ible of the great Honour and Fame which he had gained by the unexpected Succe&s;&s;es of this Campaign, being unwilling to lo&s;e the &s;ame, &s;o &s;oon as he heard that the Imperial Army was marched towards <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> he re&s;olved to return homewards, and not to tempt Fortune again for this Year, and accord|ingly marched again with his whole Army to <HI>Teme&s;waer,</HI> whence he &s;ent Commands and Decrees one after the other, with Let|ters to <HI>Ziafer</HI> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> to pro|vide <HI>Teme&s;waer</HI> with all &s;orts of Victuals nece&s;&s;ary for maintenance of the Place; and that he &s;hould take care to &s;end them thi|ther, with a Convoy &s;ufficient to defend them from the Enemy: And farther he ordered that Pa&s;ha to take notice, That he was returning to his Palace at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> by the way of <HI>Walachia,</HI> of which Ad|vice was given to the Prince, and Com|mands &s;ent him to repair the Bridges, and mend the Ways of that Country, and to enlarge them for the more ea&s;ie Pa&s;&s;age of the Army:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sultan Orders for his Return to <HI>Adria|nople.</HI></NOTE> The like Decrees and Com|mands were &s;ent to the Prince of <HI>Moldavia;</HI> and divers Letters were Wrote by the Grand Seignior him&s;elf to his Mother the Valide Soltana; as al&s;o to all the Chief Governors of the Provinces in <HI>Anatolia,</HI> and to the Chimacams of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Adrianople;</HI> in which, after he had recount|ed unto them all his great Actions and Suc|ce&s;&s;es, he Commanded that Days and Nights of Rejoycings &s;hould be celebrated for the &s;ame through all the Dominions of his Empire, in regard that he had Taken, and laid De&s;olate a greater City and Ter|ritory than that of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and that he had &s;lain more than 10000 <HI>Germans,</HI> and made above 3000 Pri&s;oners, with the Offi|cers belonging to them; for which Glori|ous Victories and Fortunes Commands were given to offer Thank&s;givings in all Places of the Empire, and to prai&s;e God, for that he had been plea&s;ed to appea&s;e his Wrath again&s;t the Mu&s;&s;elmen, who had long provoked the Divine Anger.</P>
<P>The Sultan being in this manner re&s;olved to make his Return to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> by way of <HI>Walachia,</HI> notice was given thereof (as we have &s;aid) to the Prince of the Coun|try, who was thereby put into a mo&s;t grievous Terrour and Con&s;ternation of Mind, not knowing what to do, or how to help and protect his Poor Mi&s;erable Province already wa&s;ted and con&s;umed by the War; and what was now to be more done on the Pa&s;&s;age of divers <HI>A&s;iaticks, Al|banians, Turks,</HI> &amp;c. was not to be re&s;olved; until the Prince con&s;idering, and revolving all things in his Mind, concluded, That the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t way was, immediately to depart and meet the Sultan on his way, according to his urgent and reiterated Commands; &s;hewing no Fears or Jealou&s;ies, but a Confidence of the Grand Seignior's Favour to him: In pur&s;uance of which, he proceeded, and met the Sultan over again&s;t <HI>Widin;</HI> where being &s;een by him, and looked upon with a tender Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignior marches back.</NOTE> and a kind A&s;pect, the poor Prince began to take Courage, and ea&s;e the Throbs of his Trem|bling Heart. How&s;oever being acquaint|ed with the Humour of the Sultans, who often &s;peak fair to their Pa&s;ha's, and yet nouri&s;h a &s;ecret De&s;ign to take away their Lives, he could not &s;ettle his Thoughts, or believe that the bitterne&s;s of Death was yet over; but there was nothing to be done now, nor any &s;tarting back, but on he mu&s;t go, as he did to the Place called <HI>Turno</HI> on this &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> where the Army Encamped on the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> and the Sultan took &s;ome Repo&s;e for certain Days, called by the <HI>Turks</HI> Days of <HI>Otoracke,</HI> the Officers of the Prince proceeding in the mean time to prepare the Ways, and to make them wider.</P>
<P>The Grand Seignior coming very weary to <HI>Turno,</HI> repo&s;ed there about an Hours time, and then Embarking in his own Boat, pa&s;&s;ed to the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danube,</HI> af|ter which the Grand Vizier followed with the whole Army, there being Boats and Floats &s;ufficient to Ferry them over. And here it is to be for ever recorded to the ho|nour of this Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> That in pa&s;|&s;ing this Province of <HI>Walachia,</HI> &s;trict Di&s;|cipline was kept, and which was ob&s;erved with &s;o much Rigour, that a Soldier dur&s;t not &s;teal an Egg, a Pullet, or a Hen; and a <HI>Tartar</HI> was known to be Hanged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tur|ki&s;h</HI> Di&s;ci|pline.</NOTE> for ta|king away a Kid by force; and two <HI>A&s;ia|tick Turks</HI> were Hanged on a Tree for Rob|bing a Bee-hive, by which Severity, to the Wonder of the whole World, the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army pa&s;&s;ed that Afflicted Province with|out the lea&s;t damage or hurt to the Peo|ple.</P>
<P>And here at this place of <HI>Turno,</HI> it is to be noted, That before the Grand Seignior pa&s;&s;ed the River, he called to him the Prince of <HI>Walachia,</HI> and be&s;towed upon him a rich Coftan, or Ve&s;t, which is a Sig|nal of the Favour of the Sultan, and told him, That he was greatly plea&s;ed and &s;a|tisfied with his Service and Diligence, com|manding him to return Home to his Place of Re&s;idence, but above all he charged him to ob&s;erve Ju&s;tice, which if he did, he &s;hould always enjoy his Favour; the like &s;aid the Grand Vizier to him, who giving

<P>When the <HI>Turks</HI> were come on the Con|fines over again&s;t <HI>Fetihlam,</HI> they Embark|ed all their Cannon and Ammunition for <HI>Belgrade;</HI> but the lighter Field-pieces, (of which they found &s;ome in <HI>Karan&s;ebes</HI>) they carried with them, to render their Entry into <HI>Adrianople,</HI> the more Stately and Mag|nificent.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t they were contriving all things for the more Triumpant Entry of the Grand Seignior; it was judged mo&s;t requi&s;ite and proper for the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Affairs, to make the Triumph into <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> which was ever e&s;teemed the Head of the Empire, and the Place where the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Throne was ever &s;eated: And as to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> it was ordered, that the Sultan &s;hould make a &s;hort &s;top there of four or five Days only; and in the mean time the Valide Soltana, with all the Fe|male Court, was ordered to take up their Quarters in the u&s;ual Places of the Great Seraglio, which was prepared on all &s;ides to be fitted for Reception of the Grand Seignior.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Seignior marches to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE>This coming of the Grand Seignior to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> was a &s;uddain Re&s;olution, and unexpected, being the effect of his Thoughts on his March, only for con&s;i|dering that <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> (ever &s;ince the <HI>Turks</HI> entered into <HI>Europe</HI>) was always e|&s;teemed the Head and Seat of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and the Place where the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperors were ever Enthroned with the Benediction of the Mufti, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Nakib, who is Chief of the Emirs, who wear green Tulbants; and al&s;o the Place where the Mufti girds the Sword to the Sultan's Thigh, called St. <HI>Juob,</HI> in Memo|ry of that Soldier, who was the fir&s;t that &s;tormed the Walls of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> when it was in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> for which rea&s;on, his Memory hath ever been held in great Veneration with the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Thoughts whereof incited the Grand Seignior with a &s;ort of Impatience and Am|bition to imitate the Practice of his Ance|&s;tors, at a time when he e&s;teemed him&s;elf Great, Pro&s;perous, and in a way to reco|ver the lo&s;t Honour and Reputation of the Empire.</P>
<P>Moreover, his De&s;ign being to be as great at Sea as at Land, or at lea&s;t of equal Match with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> or to have a better Army to enter into the <HI>Morea,</HI> and recover the Country, his Thoughts were fixed upon <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> as the proper Place for that De&s;ign; as <HI>Adrianople</HI> was for the Wars by Land &s;o no time was lo&s;t in the March of the Army, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Ancient Seat of the <HI>O&s;manlees.</HI></P>

<P>And now about the beginning of this Month of <HI>November,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Novemb.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Allai,</HI> or Triumph at the En|trance into <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople.</HI></NOTE> the Grand Seignior with all his Court, entered into the Capital City of his Re&s;idence, with &s;uch Applau&s;e and Triumph, and Joy of the People, that the like was never heard or known in the Time of any former Sultan, all which &s;er|ved to comfort the People, and encourage the Militia.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Particulars of this Tri|umph, 300 Slaves were &s;hown, and all repre&s;ented for Great Generals and Cap|tains; for tho' there were but very few Officers among&s;t them, yet they were gi|ven out for &s;uch, and for <HI>German</HI> Princes: All the light Cannon, and Field-Pieces, with the Ammunition, Colours, Flags, Drums, and Trumpets, were all &s;howed, and brought into the Account of Spoil; with a Report among&s;t the Soldiery, That the <HI>Turks</HI> had not lo&s;t above 500 Men, kil|led in the Field, tho' others of them which came out of the Army, and had been Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of the whole Battel, and of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of 50000 Men, with the Sultan at the Head of them, and yet were hard put to it to fight again&s;t 8000 of <HI>Veterani</HI>'s Men; who having maintained a Fight for &s;ix Hours, were at length forced to retire for want of Powder and Ammunition, and other Warlike Pro|vi&s;ions.</P>

<P>How&s;oever all the World cannot but confe&s;s, That the lo&s;s of &s;o many Brave Men, could not but prove a fatal Blow to all <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> e&s;pecially to the <HI>Germans,</HI> who fought almo&s;t to the la&s;t Drop of Blood: Nor were the <HI>Turks</HI> un&s;en&s;ible of their Lo&s;&s;es al&s;o, both as to Numbers and Quality; for one of the Sultan's Brothers-in-Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sahin Pa|&s;ha <HI>killed.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>Sahin Mehmet Pa&s;ha,</HI> a brisk daring Man, and a good Soldier, and &s;o Named from <HI>Sahin,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Fal|con, and was the next to the Grand Vizier, and carried three Hor&s;e-Tails gilded before him, was killed by a Carbine-&s;hot; for which rea&s;on he was much lamented at the Court, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially by the Queen-Mother, not only becau&s;e he had been her Son-in-Law, but a Per&s;on endued with many Rare and Excellent Vertues: Be&s;ides which, the famous <HI>Mahmud Pa&s;ha,</HI> Celebrated by all to be one of the mo&s;t Accompli&s;hed Soldiers of this Age, and the mo&s;t Warlike Cavalier of all the <HI>Otto|man</HI> Nation: He was an <HI>Albanian</HI> Born, a Man of great Reputation and Fame, called <HI>Mahmud Bei Oghli,</HI> and was &s;lain with three Carbine-&s;hots, and fell among&s;t the mo&s;t Renowned Officers of the <HI>Turks:</HI> The&s;e two were &s;aid to be the fir&s;t who broke into <HI>Veterani</HI>'s Army, one to the Right, and the other to the Left-Wing, where they found and encountred &s;uch unexpe|cted Oppo&s;ition, that the <HI>Turks</HI> confe&s;&s;ed, That they had never met the like, and had not prevailed again&s;t their Enemies at that time, had it not been for the Re&s;oluti|on and Bravery of their Fortunate Sultan, who &s;tanding in the Rear with his Scimi|ter in his Hand, hindered the ba&s;e intend|ed Flight of his Soldiery.</P>
<P>This Action gave a full &s;top to all the following De&s;igns of this Year; for the <HI>Turks</HI> rea&s;oning with them&s;elves, That in ca&s;e &s;o &s;mall an Army as that of <HI>Veterani,</HI> was able to do &s;uch Feats, what would be|come of their Forces, were they to engage again&s;t the whole entire Army of the <HI>Kral,</HI> that is the Elector; for they call the King of <HI>Poland Kral,</HI> and &s;o other Inferiour Princes to the Emperor, whom they call <HI>Kai&s;ar;</HI> but the King of <HI>England,</HI> they could never be taught to call otherwi&s;e than <HI>Kral.</HI></P>

<P>This Great <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire had the la&s;t Year changed both their Ma&s;ter, and the Chief Officers, without any con&s;iderable Change, or Troubles in the State among&s;t them&s;elves, for that this Sultan, in whom clearly appeared a Spirit of greater Wi&s;dom and Courage than in his Father <HI>Mahomet</HI> IV, or in his Uncle's &s;ucceeding him, gave the Soldiery and the People &s;uch Hopes and Expectations from him, that none dur&s;t open his Mouth, or lift up his Hands a|gain&s;t him; there appeared al&s;o &s;omething more of Ju&s;tice and Vertue in him, and of Diligence, and Care, and Sedulity in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, than was found in his Father, or in any of the &s;ucceeding Uncles, as we have formerly &s;aid; which gave hope to the great Governors of the Empire, that under him the Lo&s;&s;es which the Empire had &s;u|&s;tained in the&s;e la&s;t Wars, might be repair|ed; for tho' the Recovery of the I&s;le of <HI>Scio</HI> was made before he came to the Throne, and con&s;equently might be looked upon, as an effect of his Uncle's Coun&s;els; for that <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> did not enter upon the Government until the end of <HI>January</HI> 1695, when that <HI>Scio</HI> had been taken about a Month before by the <HI>Turks;</HI> but that fal|ling &s;o near to the time that <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> came to the Throne, that piece of good Fortune was looked upon as an effect of the Wi&s;|dom of the New Emperor, rather than of the Uncle <HI>Achmet</HI>'s Coun&s;el, by which, and by &s;ome other Exploits of the preceding Year in 1695, <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> grew high in the Opinion of the People, and the Soldiery; to which &s;ome Succe&s;&s;es being added, as the taking of <HI>Titul</HI> and <HI>Lippa,</HI> with the De|feat given to <HI>Veterani;</HI> for which the <HI>Turks</HI> paid very dear, and would not have been cried up for a Victory, had not Victories become very rare in tho&s;e Days; their Hopes were very big, and that he might make the&s;e Actions the more Triumphant and Glorious, the Grand Seignior di&s;patch|ed away &s;everal Me&s;&s;engers to the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and to other Tributaries, to communicate unto them all his Succe&s;&s;es and Victories of the la&s;t Year, whereby he hoped to encourage the drooping Spirits of his own Soldiers, and confirm tho&s;e of his Friends and Al|lies unto him.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of <HI>Scio</HI> was certainly not very con&s;iderable to the <HI>Venetians</HI> at that time after they had gained it from the <HI>Turks;</HI> for Conque&s;ts at &s;uch a di&s;tance from them can never turn to any Account, or bene|fit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Morea</HI> indeed may be a more u&s;eful Conque&s;t, than any of tho&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where the <HI>Turks</HI> are far &s;tronger than on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and this Year al&s;o the <HI>Venetians</HI> had been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in tho&s;e Parts of the <HI>Morea,</HI> having Defeat|ed the <HI>Turks</HI> there in all their Attempts, in this as well as &s;everal other Years; but the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es are not likely to be conti|nued, for unle&s;s the <HI>Venetians</HI> increa&s;e the Number of their Ships at Sea, and aug|ment their Forces at Land; and make good choice of their principal Commanders; all Matters will probably go backwards; for &s;uch Generals as <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> and <HI>Koni&s;marc</HI> are not ea&s;ily to be found, under whom all things thrived and pro&s;pered, &s;o that it were now to be wi&s;hed, that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Forces were more numerous than former|ly, and compo&s;ed of their own Subjects, rather than of Foreigners.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Turks</HI> had a more watchful Eye over their War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Parts about <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> than ei|ther in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> or other Countries of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> or over the Province of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> or <HI>Ba&s;orat,</HI> of which the <HI>Arabians</HI> had made a late Conque&s;t over the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ba&s;ha of that Country, who having but 2000 Men with him, was forced to &s;ubmit to the

<P>About the &s;ame time likewi&s;e <HI>Solyman Bey,</HI> a <HI>Turk,</HI> a Native of <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> having routed a Party of <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> on the Frontiers, had a Commi&s;&s;ion given him by the Grand Seignior, to do all the Mi&s;chief he was a|ble on the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> not on the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> only, but on the <HI>Georgians</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> who had joyned together and made them&s;elves Princes of tho&s;e Provin|ces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vene|tians</HI> at Sea give a Defeat to the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>Nor did the Affairs of the <HI>Turks</HI> pro&s;per better at that time in the <HI>Morea,</HI> where a &s;trong Party of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Forces made an Irruption upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> and advan|ced &s;o far as <HI>Thebes,</HI> where the <HI>Turks</HI> re|ceived an entire Defeat, all the Country being Spoiled, Plundered, and Sacked by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who upon their return car|ried with them a great Booty, with va&s;t Numbers of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slaves.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Matters were tran&s;acting, the Sultan was diligently employed at the Port in forming a Numerous Army, and providing all things for the Support and Maintenance of them. Nor was the like Diligence wanting in preparing and &s;etting forth their Fleet, and putting them into a po&s;ture capable to Fight and Engage the <HI>Venetians;</HI> but as to the Land-Forces, the Campaign of this Year began early in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> when the <HI>Heydukes</HI> in di|vers places of <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> a&s;&s;embled them|&s;elves in a Body to the Number of 400 Men, with which they pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Save,</HI> and made an Inroad &s;o far as <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> about eight or nine Days to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and in that March, they drove away great Numbers of &s;mall and great Cattle; after which they contrived in what manner to make their Retreat; but as they thought thereupon, the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and other Neighbouring Places, made a Sally out upon them with a Party of about 2000 Men, Hor&s;e and Foot, who being in|formed of the Enemies De&s;ign, they drew up &s;o advantagiou&s;ly in a Wood, and re|ceived them with &s;o great Bravery, that after &s;everal Repul&s;es given them, in which great Numbers were Killed and Wounded, were at length forced to fly and quit the Field, whil&s;t the <HI>Sclavonians</HI> made good their Retreat, and proceeded happily in their De&s;ign, which is all the Prologue that was made to the &s;ucceeding Actions of the following Campaign; only every thing began then to di&s;po&s;e it &s;elf towards a Bloody War, and for Action of the follow|ing Year: When the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> made his fir&s;t Campaign in <HI>Hungary</HI> in Quality of Major-General of the Imperial-Army, Commanding in particular the Regiments of St. <HI>Croix, de Commerci,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;&s;ompierre,</HI> in which Commands this Young Prince e|videnced to the World, a clear Inclination, and Di&s;po&s;ition to the War, agreeable to the Mind of his Illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t things were thus preparing in <HI>Hungary,</HI> News came to the Port from <HI>Di|arbekir,</HI> giving the Relation of a Fight be|tween the Rebels in tho&s;e Parts, and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in which the <HI>Turks</HI> had been De|feated, and their General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pa&s;ha of <HI>Diarbe|kir</HI> put to Flight.</NOTE> the Pa&s;ha of <HI>Di|arbekir,</HI> put to Flight, at a Place not far from <HI>Sivas:</HI> The Particulars of which &s;uc|ceeded in this manner.</P>

<P>The Sultan who intended to have brought this Year 80 or 100000 Men in|to the Field again&s;t the Emperor, was con|tented to fall &s;hort at lea&s;t 10000 Men of that Number which he had the la&s;t Year: And in regard the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Soldiers could not, or would not leave their own Coun|try to attend the Armies in <HI>Hungary;</HI> the whole Army of the <HI>Turks</HI> did not amount to more than 50000 Men; and &s;carcely to that neither con&s;idering the Diver&s;ions made on one &s;ide by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> on the other; wherefore con&s;idering the&s;e Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, all the <HI>Ottoracks</HI> were called to the Wars, being in the Nature of <HI>Milites immeriti,</HI> who after their long Services in the War, have liberty given them to withdraw to their own Homes, with two Pence or three Pence a Day, which is called a dead Pay; and of the&s;e there may be about 40000 Men, which may be &s;ome Addition to the Number of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, and with the&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> were now obliged to help them&s;elves.</P>

<P>As to the Land Matters, <HI>March</HI> the 28th the Grand Seignior and Grand Vizier made their Alloy to their Tents, which were pitched as u&s;ual at <HI>Daout Pa&s;ha;</HI> but that being very early in the Morning, the Show was but indifferent.

<P>Whil&s;t this was doing, another Body of the Enemies Hor&s;e Charged another Body on the &s;econd Line, where the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Troops received them in &s;uch a manner, as gave a Check to their Fury, and then Ge|neral <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> advancing with the Hor&s;e of the &s;ame Line, drove them back, and pur&s;ued them about two <HI>Hungarian</HI> Miles, when the Victory began to declare it &s;elf in fa|vour of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> to put them&s;elves into Flight, when Orders came to General <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> to &s;top the Pur&s;uit, and to march back with the Troops; how&s;oever &s;ome other Squadrons of Hor&s;e followed the Enemies unto their Intrenchments; from whence the <HI>Turks</HI> made &s;o great a Fire both with their Cannon and Small-&s;hot, that tho&s;e Squadrons were forced to retire; and being pur&s;ued by the Enemies Hor&s;e, they encountred another of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Regiments, which they al&s;o put into Di&s;|order; which General <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> ob&s;erving, ad|vanced with the Regiment of <HI>Caprara,</HI> and Charging the Enemy in the Flank, cut off above 1000 of them: Then the whole <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Line advanced, and pu&s;hed the Enemy into their Trenches, where they were in &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that the Sultan him&s;elf with much difficulty pre|vailed upon them to keep their Ground, and defend their Intrenchments, killing &s;e|veral with his own Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> wor&s;ted.</NOTE> that would have fled; and at length Night coming on, it put an end to the Battle.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> remaining Ma&s;ters of the Field, or Place of Battle, intended to Attack again the Enemies Camp by Break of Day in the Morning; but they laboured &s;o hard all that Night, that they fortified their Camp, and made it almo&s;t impregnable; which hindered the <HI>Germans</HI> from making another Attempt in the Morning.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> lo&s;t a great many Men in this Fight, among&s;t which were divers Of|ficers of Fame and Renown, as <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> General of the Hor&s;e, and Major-General <HI>Polland,</HI> be&s;ides others who died of their Wounds.</P>

<P>The Troops on both &s;ides often min|gled, and gave no Quarter on either &s;ide. A great Booty was taken from the <HI>Turks,</HI> among&s;t which were many fine Hor&s;es, with &s;everal Standards.</P>
<P>In the heat of this Action the <HI>Germans</HI> lo&s;t &s;ome Pieces of Cannon, by rea&s;on that their Carriages were &s;hot in pieces and the Hor&s;es which drew them were killed.</P>
<P>The 27th of this Month of <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Septemb. 27, <HI>and</HI> 28.</NOTE> the whole <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army remained that whole Day in Po&s;ture of Battle before their Camp; but the Enemy not appearing, His Electoral Highne&s;s re&s;olved to pa&s;s the <HI>Beque,</HI> and to march towards the River <HI>They&s;&s;e,</HI> to &s;upply the Army with Provi&s;ions, of which they began to be in want, which was done the 28th when the <HI>Turks</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the River in like manner.</P>
<P>And on the 29th the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Army En|camped at <HI>Ola&s;ch,</HI> near the <HI>They&s;&s;e,</HI> where General <HI>Staremberg</HI> joyned the re&s;t of the Army with &s;ix Regiments of Hor&s;e from <HI>Titul;</HI> and Orders were &s;ent to the <HI>Bran|denburghers,</HI> and other Troops, that were not in the Battle, having been po&s;ted in &s;everal Flying Camps, to joyn the Army, which being refre&s;hed, were ordered to march again to ob&s;erve the Enemy in their Motion.</P>
<P>This is the Account which the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves give of this Battle, which be|ing fini&s;hed, as here de&s;cribed, both Ar|mies thought it now to be the Time and Sea&s;on to withdraw out of the Field; and &s;o the Elector withdrew out of the Field, and came to <HI>Vienna;</HI> by which it was judg|ed, that no farther Action would happen for that Year; and in confirmation thereof, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet retired into <HI>Salankement,</HI> without having done any thing of moment for this whole Year: It is not to be doubt|ed, but that the I&s;&s;ue of this Battel turned to the Advantage of the Imperiali&s;ts, un|le&s;s it be that they left 26 Pieces of Can|non in the Bu&s;hes.</P>

<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador having remained about 12 Days at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and there well en|tertained, he demanded Audience of the Grand Vizier, to whom he delivered the Credentials from the King his Ma&s;ter; and having been entertain'd in Di&s;cour&s;e for about the &s;pace of three Quarters of an Hour, he departed from the Grand Vizier, having only received one &s;ingle Ve&s;t, which &s;eemed very &s;trange, in regard it had been the Cu&s;tom for other Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to receive 60, at lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed be|tween them and their Retinue.</P>

<P>The&s;e things being over, great Prepa|rations were making for the following Campaign, both by Sea and Land; &s;eve|ral half Gallies were already built for the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> Commanded by <HI>Dervi&s;h Ogli Bei</HI> of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> The Fleet under the Com|mand of <HI>Mezzo Morto,</HI> who was Captain-Pa&s;ha, con&s;i&s;ted of 25 Sail of Men of War, all of them being the Grand Seigni|or's own Ships, and &s;uch as being joyned with tho&s;e of <HI>Barbary,</HI> would be too &s;trong a Match for the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>This whole Winter the Grand Seignior pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where after the Ex|ample of his Father, he delighted much in Hunting.

<P>THE Embroils in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> with the begin|ning of this Year &s;eemed to be a little quieted, gave hopes to the <HI>Turks,</HI> <MILESTONE N="1697"> that <HI>Ba&s;ora</HI> would &s;hortly be re&s;tored to them.</P>
<P>'Twas thought at this time, that the Marquis <HI>de Lore</HI> making little or no &s;how at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> being then in Quality of Envoy Extraordinary, would follow the Camp for the en&s;uing Campaign; but as to the Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Ca&s;telneuf,</HI> he re&s;olved to remain at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> acting for the Af|fairs of their King and Nation, between whom and the Marquis appeared no good under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Friend&s;hip &s;till continued, and &s;eemed to increa&s;e between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> till the latter began to be &s;ome|thing doubtful of them, upon the Reports and Rumours which flew about, That the <HI>French</HI> were bu&s;ied in making a General Peace with all the Allies; tho' they at fir&s;t confidently denied it to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding grew Jealous of them; and from that time their Mutual Friend&s;hip began much to abate.</P>
<P>The Tumults in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> &s;till continued; to quiet which, and to carry on the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> prepared to enter into <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> to which end they daily Li&s;ted and Enrolled New Spahee's and Ja|ni&s;aries in all the Provinces of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> i&s;&s;uing forth very rigorous Orders, That the Mi|litia in all tho&s;e Parts &s;hould this Year ap|pear early in the Field; and greater Prepa|rations were making for this Year, than for a long time before, by rea&s;on that the
<PB N="545" REF="300"> Sultan out of his Glory and Pride, re&s;ol|ved to make his utmo&s;t Effort this Year on <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> and according|ly to win all back again, and if not to put an end to the War, to come to an Honour|able Accommodation of Peace, which the <HI>Turks</HI> were &s;en&s;ible could not be avoided, in ca&s;e they &s;hould receive any Blow, or &s;uddain Foyl the next Year from the <HI>Chri|&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>This the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> &s;o plainly fore&s;aw, that they lay upon the watch to ob&s;erve all the Inclinati|ons and Motions of the <HI>Turks;</HI> and both &s;ides now e&s;teeming them&s;elves upon the Cri&s;is, laboured all that was po&s;&s;ible to bring things to their de&s;ired I&s;&s;ue; when daily Spahees and Commi&s;&s;aries were em|ployed to gather and collect Sums of Mo|ney in all the <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> Provinces, were ob|&s;erved to pa&s;s the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and other Seas, for Service of the War; of which the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> being informed, wrote to the Sultan to &s;end them Money to &s;upply their Occa|&s;ions again&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> of whom they were more affraid than of the <HI>Polanders.</HI> How&s;oever the <HI>Turks</HI> being Headed by &s;o Brave a Sultan as this pre&s;ent Grand Seig|nior, as they thought, did not &s;eem to fear any thing, but to carry all before them, which &s;o elevated them to &s;uch a heighth of Pride and In&s;olence, that the Mediators were of an Opinion, That until a con&s;ide|rable Blow were given to the <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati|ons for the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet.</NOTE> it would be impo&s;&s;ible to reduce them to any Terms of Rea&s;on and Moderation.</P>
<P>In which Humour they made Preparati|ons for the following Year both by Sea and Land: That for the Sea de&s;igned for the <HI>Euxine,</HI> was chiefly provided at a Port called <HI>Sinap,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Trabe&s;onda,</HI> where they al&s;o were ca&s;ting many great and heavy Cannon: And into the Ar&s;enal of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> were in this Month of <HI>January</HI> 120 Cannon more brought in and lodged there.</P>
<P>But what other Sultans have not done, this hath had the Ambition to perform; that is, under his own Name all the Pieces of Gold and Silver &s;hould pa&s;s, within his Empire; the like of which was never known in any other Country, unle&s;s in <HI>England</HI> under the Reign of King <HI>Wil|liam</HI> III, and the Great. I cannot &s;ay that all the Gold and Silver within the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions was brought into the Mint to be new Coined, but it is certainly reported, that a great part thereof was; to which the five Sol Pieces made by the <HI>French, Ita|lians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alteration of the Coyn in <HI>Turky.</HI></NOTE> and other Nations, greatly helped and contributed, of which there had been many Millions Imported in 15 Years, from 65 to 80, which were very beneficial to the Coynage of tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o farther commanded, That all tho&s;e who had any <HI>Venetian</HI> Zechins, &s;hould bring them to the Mint, there to be new &s;tamped with the Letters of this Sultan's Name, and there to be changed with the old ones of <HI>Venice,</HI> or otherwi&s;e changed for Silver, at the rate of two Dollars and a half <HI>per</HI> Zechin: Likewi&s;e all the <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> Dollars, commonly imported by the <HI>Dutch</HI> with the Figure of a Lion thereupon, were order'd to be brought into the Exchequer, where the Figure of the Lion being beaten out with the Hammer, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Impre&s;|&s;ion with the Name of the Sultan, was to be fixed in the place thereof: To bear the Charges of this new Coyning, a quarter of a Dram of Silver was taken from every Lion-Dollar, and then it was put into the Fire, where it was Hammered again, and &s;ome <HI>Cbri&s;tian</HI> Letters on the &s;ide thereof were permitted to remain, that thereby it might appear, that the &s;ame were reformed Dollars, and &s;uch as came from the <HI>Chri|&s;tians;</HI> and that for the Alterations thereof, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Workmen were not to be bla|med; for which Work the <HI>Turks, Grecians, Armenians,</HI> and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Workmen, had &s;o much allowed them by the Day, according to their Agreement.</P>
<P>About this time, being the Month of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI> Advices were brought frequently to the Sultan then at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> That the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> were fully re&s;olved this Year to fall down by Sea up|on <HI>Caffa;</HI> which being believed, and &s;o expected, very &s;trict and &s;evere Orders were given by the <HI>Turks,</HI> to provide and equip 80 Frigats, with 15 Gallies, and many other Tran&s;port-Ships, to carry the Militia into the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> to hinder the De&s;cent, or Landing of the <HI>Mo&s;covites;</HI> which Report gave great Fears and Ap|prehen&s;ions to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who thereupon took different Re&s;olutions and Mea&s;ures in their Affairs.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Preparations for the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> there were others made for the <HI>Euxine,</HI> or <HI>White-Sea,</HI> where <HI>Mezzo Morto</HI> was ap|pointed Captain-Pa&s;ha, or General again&s;t the <HI>Venetians,</HI> being accounted a Man of great Courage, and Conduct, at which time there was building a Ship of an im|men&s;e bigne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maritime Preparati|ons for the Year <HI>1697.</HI></NOTE> which had been already many Months upon the Stocks, being built by <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Ma&s;ters, the like of which, that is &s;o large, had never been built in that Ar&s;enal; for it could carry more than 600 Soldiers, be&s;ides Seamen, and Levents; the which being put into &s;ome tolerable condition of readine&s;s to
<PB N="546" REF="301" MS="y"> Sail, the Sultan to &s;how his Greatne&s;s at Sea, as well as at Land, to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, (who remained behind, after the great Emba&s;&s;y) i&s;&s;ued out his Com|mands to three Pa&s;ha's, whom he had made Generals, to equip and fit them&s;elves brave|ly.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was <HI>Mezzo Morto,</HI> who was to Engage the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet at Sea, and to return Victorious; and in ca&s;e they did, he a&s;&s;ured them, that they &s;hould gain his &s;ingular Grace and Favour; and as an evi|dence thereof, he be&s;towed upon each of them a very rich Coftan, or Ve&s;t, richly lined with Sables.</P>
<P>The Second was al&s;o a Pa&s;ha Vice-Ad|miral, de&s;igned again&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>The third was al&s;o a Pa&s;ha, in Quality of a Rear-Admiral, who was to mount the <HI>Danube,</HI> and engage again&s;t the Imperial Fleet, where&s;oever they &s;hould encounter them, either about <HI>Belgrade,</HI> or <HI>Buda,</HI> or any other Parts of the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>After the Sultan had pa&s;&s;ed this Cere|mony, he gave leave to his Generals to depart, and &s;peaking very kindly and gra|ciou&s;ly to them, he encouraged them to put them&s;elves in order for their Re&s;pe|ctive Voyages: So that now it was very apparent, that tho' the <HI>Turks</HI> would be much weaker this Year by Land, than they were the la&s;t, yet they would be far &s;tron|ger by Sea, having <HI>Mezzo Morto</HI> for their Admiral, and every thing in their feveral Fleets di&s;po&s;ed for Maritime and Naval Engagements; the Succe&s;s of which, we may &s;hortly hear in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e Months which are proper for Actions of the Sea.</P>
<P>But before we proceed &s;o far, it may be pertinent to our Bu&s;ine&s;s to recount how the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Court lo&s;t a Law-Suit which he had with a certain <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> to his great Mortifica|tion; for &s;uppo&s;ing that he was able to a|vail in all Points, where his Ma&s;ter's Inte|re&s;t was concerned; he was highly trou|bled to find him&s;elf di&s;appointed in a Bu&s;i|ne&s;s at <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> relating to &s;o incon&s;i|derable a Per&s;on as a <HI>Jew.</HI> The Matter was in this manner.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t know, that the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> have commonly very great Power, by rea|&s;on that every Pa&s;ha of <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> who is the greate&s;t Beglerbey in all the Empire, when he enters upon that Office, he com|monly takes with him from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;ome Subtle <HI>Jew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Story of the Con&s;ul and a <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Gran Cairo.</HI></NOTE> who is a Man of great Riches, to manage the va&s;t Revenue of that Province; which &s;ets him up &s;o high, that he is above the reach of all the Gran|dees of the Empire, and is Honoured and Reverenced as the <HI>Dominus Fac totum,</HI> or as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in the Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Nation had at that time a Con&s;ul in <HI>Cairo,</HI> who thought him&s;elf a Match for the <HI>Jew;</HI> who on the other &s;ide e&s;teemed him&s;elf higher than all the <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> or Beyes, or Agaw's of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and con&s;equently comported him&s;elf with Neglect and Di&s;e&s;teem towards the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul, which he not being able to &s;upport, made his Complaints to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;|&s;ador at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> again&s;t the In&s;olence of a <HI>Jew,</HI> of which the Con&s;ul gave a mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ionate Report to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chateau|neuf,</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador for the <HI>French</HI> King at the Port; where he &s;o managed the Bu|&s;ine&s;s, that a Chiaus was &s;ent for to fetch the <HI>Jew</HI> from <HI>Cairo,</HI> to the Divan at <HI>Adri|anople;</HI> who accordingly taking this long Journey, appeared in Judgment before the Grand Vizier.</P>
<P>This <HI>Jew</HI> had the Report among&s;t all People, of being a Per&s;on very Judicious, Prudent, and of a patient Temper; and &s;ince it was the Office of the Amba&s;&s;ador to appear again&s;t this <HI>Jew</HI> in Judgment be|fore the Grand Vizier, the <HI>Jew</HI> behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much Mode&s;ty, and Pru|dence, that he gave unto all the Standers by, &s;ome deep Impre&s;&s;ions of his Under|&s;tanding and Innocence, and that he had been injured by the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul at <HI>Cairo,</HI> of who&s;e Hone&s;ty and Wi&s;dom, the World in tho&s;e Parts, had not conceived any high Opinion, nor yet of the <HI>French</HI> Nation: But that depending too much on their great Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Turks,</HI> they pre&s;umed to in&s;ult over a People, which had not for &s;ome Ages been accu&s;tomed to hard U&s;ages from <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Nations. Notwith&s;tanding all which, and that the Grand Vizier had patiently under&s;tood the Pleadings on both &s;ides, and was as well po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Cabals of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, yet he gave Orders to the Chi|aus-Ba&s;hee to take the <HI>Jew</HI> into Arre&s;t; the which was &s;aid to have been done out of Policy by the Vizier, to cool, and mo|derate the Anger of the Amba&s;&s;ador, who plainly declared, <HI>That unle&s;s his Ma&s;ter, the King, had &s;atisfaction in this particular, he was commanded to retire back into</HI> France, <HI>and to bring with him all the</HI> French <HI>Mer|chants, and all others of that Nation, into their own Country.</HI></P>
<P>It not being now a time for the <HI>Turks</HI> to Quarrel with the <HI>French,</HI> or to create more Enemies than they have already, they took the&s;e Menaces with an unaccu|&s;tomed Patience, tho' the Great Officers being offended hereat, vented an abun|dance of Reproaches again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="547" REF="301"> Nation; only the Grand Vizier u&s;ing his accu&s;tomed Patience, &s;aid, <HI>That Ju&s;tice could never do Injury to any, for that their Law, and the Alchoran, commanded it &s;o to be done.</HI></P>
<P>And in this manner this Difference pa&s;|&s;ed over, with &s;ome Advantage to the <HI>French,</HI> who had obliged &s;o great a Per&s;on as the <HI>Jew,</HI> who is the Negotiator of all the Affairs of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to leave his Employ|ment to attend the Summons of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at &s;uch a di&s;tance as it is from <HI>Gran Cairo</HI> to <HI>Adrianople:</HI> How&s;oever after all this, the <HI>French</HI> Nation did not &s;eem to be fully &s;atisfied, becau&s;e that the Vizier after all &s;hewed &s;ome Re&s;pect to the <HI>Jew,</HI> be&s;towing upon him a Coftan, or Ve&s;t of Favour and Honour, declaring him&s;elf in favour of the <HI>Jew,</HI> that he had been fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, and injuriou&s;ly drawn away from the Grand Seignior's Service. To repair which Affront and Neglect to the King of <HI>France,</HI> a Demand was made by the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, That Licen&s;e might be given to Repair and Rebuild the Cathedral Church in <HI>Galata,</HI> which had for above 500 Years remained in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Hands, and la&s;t|ly had been Repaired and Rebuilt at the Charges of the Mo&s;t Serene Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;oon after the la&s;t War which they had with the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Candia;</HI> but now the <HI>French</HI> depending on the great Services they had done the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;eized on the Church, which had been the Cathedral of that Dioce&s;e, and affixed the Arms of <HI>France</HI> upon the Gates thereof; at which the <HI>Venetians</HI> being greatly offended, who were the Patrons thereof, and had many Years pa&s;t purcha&s;ed the Advow&s;on from the <HI>Turks,</HI> made their Complaints to the Grand Vizier of the Inju&s;tice which had been done them: Upon which, the Vizier re&s;olving to end the Controver&s;ie between the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;eized the Church of Saint <HI>Francis</HI> or <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> in <HI>Galata,</HI> and Con|verted it into a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mo&s;ch; and in &s;uch like manner commonly end all the Con|trover&s;ies which <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> have between them&s;elves, that are referred to, or to be termined by, the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The Ceremony which the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;ed in turning the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church into a Mo&s;ch, was by a Command from the Sul|tan to the Chimacam, to enter the Church with 200 Men of his Followers, together with a good Number of their Imaums, who began at their fir&s;t Entry into the Church to &s;ing with a loud Voice, the Tune and Song called <HI>Sele,</HI> which is a Hymn extracted out of the Alcoran, to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God; the which cau|&s;ed great Sadne&s;s in the Hearts and Eyes of many good <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in <HI>Galata;</HI> which had not been done, as many <HI>Turks</HI> confe&s;s, had not the <HI>French</HI> pretended a Right to that Church; with which they in a &s;hort time were forced to &s;wallow two very bitter Pills, to the Di&s;honour of <HI>France,</HI> and Prejudice to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the Month of <HI>March,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> the Sultan equipped out &s;even great Men of War of 50 and 60 Pieces of Cannon each, and all armed with 500 Levents, or &s;o many Sea-Soldiers a piece; be&s;ides which there were 14 light Gallies, with 25 Fri|gats, and all accompanied with divers Sai|ches laden with Provi&s;ions, every one of which will carry as much as 200 Carts, which are laden with Biskets, Meal, and all &s;orts of other Ammunition.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were in Action, the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chateaneuf,</HI> offered this Summer to make his Campaign with the Grand Seignior in <HI>Hungary</HI> again&s;t the Emperor, with which the <HI>Turks</HI> were well enough plea&s;ed, in regard they e&s;teem|ed this Amba&s;&s;ador to be a Man of great Wi&s;dom and Experience.</P>
<P><HI>Tekely</HI> likewi&s;e about this time was pre|paring him&s;elf to accompany the Vizier to the War in <HI>Hungary,</HI> the which &s;ome were of an Opinion, That it would be of good con&s;equence to the Sultan; upon which account the Vizier conceived a great e&s;teem for him; and was de&s;irous to &s;ee the good Effects of all tho&s;e Promi&s;es, which <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Prince&s;s had made to him.</P>
<P>This Lady of <HI>Tekely</HI> went unto, and re|turned from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> and was ob&s;erved to be of an Humour very A&s;&s;iduous, Dili|gent, and Malitious again&s;t the Imperial|li&s;ts, but very kind and obliging towards the <HI>French,</HI> but mo&s;t e&s;pecially to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Laurent,</HI> who the la&s;t Year was with the Sultan in the Campaign of <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> and was often invited by <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Lady, and by Count <HI>Tekely</HI> him&s;elf, to take a Dinner, or a Supper, or &s;ome other Repa&s;t with them, at which Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Laurent</HI> was often welcomed, and highly Treated.</P>
<P>A Friend of mine once acquainted me, That having a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Wife, or Prince&s;s of <HI>Tekely,</HI> he had the Fortune to hear Ma&s;s with her at the <HI>Capuchin</HI>'s Church at <HI>Galata,</HI> where well ob&s;erving her Phy&s;iognomy, it appeared very Ill-favour'd, Old, and Ugly: She profe&s;&s;es to be a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> of which &s;he boa&s;ts to many People, and that her Hus|band hath divers Corre&s;pondents almo&s;t in every Regiment belonging to the Imperial Army, from whom he hath all the Cor|re&s;pondencies imaginable with the Princi|pal
<PB N="548" REF="302"> Commanders both of Hor&s;e and Foot, by means of which nothing pa&s;&s;es, but what he hath a good and perfect Account of, from all parts of the Imperial Ar|my.</P>
<P>The Army which was formed and drawn up again&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted for the mo&s;t part of Spahee's from <HI>Anatolia,</HI> and of a &s;ort of a Militia of <HI>Pa&s;cialagio,</HI> belonging to <HI>Sili&s;tra,</HI> of which they reck|oned about 35000 Men, be&s;ides <HI>Tar|tars.</HI></P>
<P>The Reputation of this pre&s;ent Sultan was &s;o great, that in all Parts both of <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> he was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t Fortunate of all the Sultans; for that in the &s;pace of two Years only appearing in the Wars, he had &s;howed &s;o much Cou|rage and good Conduct, that he had al|ways beaten the <HI>Germans;</HI> that is to &s;ay, when he went him&s;elf in Per&s;on to the Wars; for which cau&s;e he was highly E|&s;teemed, Honoured, and Obeyed.</P>

The Relation on the &s;ide of the <HI>Turks,</HI> was repre&s;ented as favourably as the thing would bear; in which he declared, That there had been a very great Battle near a River, in which his Per&s;on was not pre|&s;ent, and &s;o was &s;afe; but his Vizier be|ing Engaged again&s;t an Army of 100000 Men, was Slain, together with the great|e&s;t Number of Jani&s;aries, and Foot Soldi|ers, and tho&s;e of the Principal Officers; the which Relation he al&s;o di&s;patched by the &s;econd Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, with a Coftan to <HI>Hu&s;&s;aein Pa&s;ha,</HI> declaring him to be Grand Vizier, which happened well for the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> for he was a Man al|ways inclined to a Peace, and no great Friend to the <HI>French;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inclinati|ons of the <HI>Turks</HI> to|wards a Peace.</NOTE> he was a great Lo|ver of Wine, which mollified the Rigorous Temper of a <HI>Turk,</HI> and made him more Jo|cund and Ea&s;ie than commonly the Water-Drinkers among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> profe&s;s to be; at which News the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> immediately conceived an abundance of Joy, not doubt|ing but that a Peace would immediately en&s;ue, as it did accordingly; for all Peo|ple were grown weary of &s;o long a War, which had now continued for about twen|ty Years, with very Unfortunate Succe&s;&s;es to the <HI>Turks</HI> both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>After all which the Grand Seignior re|turned with what &s;peed he could to his Se|raglio at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> where all things had put on a Countenance of Melancholy and Sadne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> re&s;olving to pro&s;ecute and follow their Blow, whil&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> with Fear and Di&s;order were fly|ing homeward, the Prince <HI>Eugenius</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;pent the whole Day on the 12th of <HI>October</HI> in pa&s;&s;ing the Imperial Army over the <HI>Save;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">October</NOTE> but the River being nar|row, and the Weather good and favoura|ble, they arrived early in the Camp on the other &s;ide:</P>
<P>And next Morning of the 13th, they began their March towards <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> which was difficult to pa&s;s, by rea&s;on of the Mountains, Woods, and Rocks in the way, which was rude, and unbeaten.</P>
<P>Upon the 14th of this Month, the Bo|dy of the Army Encamped about <HI>Kottor,</HI> where the March had been wor&s;e, and more difficult, and longer by an Hour than the Day before; and tho' Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> with his Squadron was marched before, how&s;o|ever he proceeded not in his March, be|cau&s;e he had News on the way, and chief|ly from <HI>Bagnaluca,</HI> That the Enemy had not the lea&s;t Intelligence of the Advance of the Imperial Army, &s;o that he made a Halt until His Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s was come up to joyn the Body under his Command, that &s;o they might hold a Conference, and Council of War together, which they per|formed &s;tanding not to lo&s;e time; and then Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> proceeded with his Forces unto <HI>Ca&s;tle Doboy,</HI> where was a Garri&s;on of <HI>Turks,</HI> and was &s;ituated two or three Hours from the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Camp: And here it was thought fit not to go farther this Night, becau&s;e they concluded, that they were not as yet di&s;covered by the E|nemy, becau&s;e they had not heard them &s;hoot the Alarm, as their Cu&s;tom was to do when&s;oever they di&s;covered any Body of Men approaching towards them; and &s;o to keep all things &s;till without any di&s;|covery, they marched with much &s;ilence, without Beat of Drum, or Sound of Trum|pet: And the very &s;ame Day the Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> arrived in the Camp; where a Coun|cil of War being called, it was concluded, That Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> &s;hould be di&s;patched away before, to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Ground near to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ca&s;tle of <HI>Doboy,</HI> as was formerly agreed, and there to form his Camp, where he was reinforced with 600 Men: Upon appearance of which, his Orders were, That in ca&s;e the Ca&s;tle did not pre&s;ently Surrender, he &s;hould march immediately forward, and without lo&s;s of time march into the Country, leaving the la&s;t 600 Men before the Ca&s;tle to inclo&s;e the Enemy, who &s;hould &s;oon be reinforced by 200 Men more: And &s;o &s;hould pro|ceed to the &s;econd Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Maglay;</HI>

<P>By this time, or towards the Morning of the 15th of this Month, &s;ome Shooting was heard, which was the fir&s;t Signal of an Alarm: How&s;oever they continued to March without beating their Drums, or &s;ounding their Trumpets; but this Days March was more trouble&s;ome and difficult than the Day before, by rea&s;on that it was through Hilly and rough Places: How&s;o|ever coming at length to <HI>Ca&s;tle Doboy,</HI> they Summoned the Place to Surrender, the which being denied at fir&s;t, by the <HI>Turks</HI> in Garri&s;on, the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> laboured all Night, and in that time rai&s;ed a Battery, on which they planted &s;ix Pieces of Cannon, with two Mortar-pieces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;tle Doboy <HI>Surrenders.</HI></NOTE>The Day following the Cannon begin|ning to play, the <HI>Turks</HI> Capitulated, and Surrendered them&s;elves at Di&s;cretion and Mercy of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about 80 Men, out of which they made Pri&s;oners of &s;uch as appeared to be the mo&s;t Soldier-like Men; as for others, who were Old, and Infirm, with Women, and Children, they gave them liberty to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and go to what Places they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;tle little Provi&s;ion was found, and few Arms, &s;o that Colonel <HI>Kyba,</HI> ac|cording to his In&s;tructions from the Gene|ral, proceeded in his March: And</P>
<P>On the 17th came to the Ca&s;tle <HI>Maglay,</HI> which upon the fir&s;t Summons Surrender|ed, on condition only to go out with their Wives and Children, leaving all other things behind them.</P>
<P>On the 18th by Break of Day in the Morning, the Garri&s;on of <HI>Maglay</HI> marched out, and Surrendered the Place: About which time nothing more was heard from the Enemy, only that the Kahya, the Son of the Decea&s;ed Pa&s;ha, was Encamped near <HI>Oro&s;&s;a Viza,</HI> and that the Imperial Fora|gers were annoyed much by the Meroders of the Enemy.</P>
<P>On the 18th they appeared before the Palanca or Pa&s;s called <HI>Schebze,</HI> wherein were 300 <HI>Turks:</HI> which upon the Sum|mons demanded a time of Con&s;ideration until the next Day, which the General of the Imperiali&s;ts would not grant them; but advanced with 400 Foot Soldiers, and 300 Dragoons, with the Artillery belong|ing to them, and mounting 12 Pieces of Cannon again&s;t the Palanca, in the Night they &s;tormed it in two Places; in which Attack having lo&s;t 12 or 15 Men within the Palli&s;adoes, without any &s;top, they &s;till advanced forward, whil&s;t Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> meeting with 200 Hor&s;e of the Ene|my, who&s;e De&s;ign was to ca&s;t them|&s;elves into the Pa&s;s <HI>Schebze,</HI> but were pre|vented, being in part killed, and in part taken Pri&s;oners: And having Intelligence, That the Kahya was with a Body of about two or 3000 Men, between <HI>Schelze</HI> and <HI>Branduck,</HI> he cau&s;ed Batteries to be rai&s;ed to hinder their ready Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>On the 19th they marched on through the <HI>Orohovizar</HI> Valley, being a very trou|ble&s;ome Pa&s;&s;age at the fir&s;t Entrance thereinto, not only for the Narrowne&s;s and Streightne&s;s of the Road, but al&s;o be|cau&s;e the Enemies on both &s;ides had cut and ruined the Ways; &s;o that about three a Clock in the Afternoon, the la&s;t Regi|ments, which were Hor&s;e, entered the Field, and joyned the former Troops, but the Infantry came not thither until it was Night; and as to the Artillery and Bag|gage, they remained full half an Hours March behind, at a di&s;tance from the nar|row Pa&s;&s;age, where it remained all the Night guarded by two Regiments of Dra|goons, which in the Morning marched in &s;afe Conduct, and guarded them in &s;afety to the Body of the Army.</P>
<P>The 20th the March was through Nar|row and Rocky Pa&s;&s;ages, wor&s;er than the former, or that way which leads to the Ca&s;tle <HI>Branduck,</HI> which was &s;o difficult, that the Imperial Army would have been in a very ill Condition, had the <HI>Turks</HI> been capable of di&s;puting vigorou&s;ly the Pa&s;&s;age with them: But at length having pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t rough and difficult Ways of <HI>Branduck,</HI> which were &s;o inconvenient, that the Artillery and Baggage could not be brought after them, but were forced to be lodged under a &s;trong Guard on the <HI>Orohovizar</HI> Valley, where the Places were fairer and more plea&s;ant, but the Inhabi|tants were fled and gone, but had left be|hind them all &s;orts of good Fruits, with &s;mall and large Cattle in great Numbers, with &s;ufficient Herbage and Su&s;tenance to maintain them.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t the Imperial Army arrived near the River <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> over which there was a Bridge, but &s;o Old and Ruinous, that the Army was not willing to adventure a Pa&s;|&s;age over it, but rather e&s;teemed it more &s;ecure for every Dragoon, or Hor&s;eman to take a Man behind him, and therewith to Wade through the River; with this Burden and Equipage they marched over a very high Hill for the &s;pace of two Hours, which neverthele&s;s was more ea&s;ie to pa&s;s over than the former: So they continued their March again over the <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> by the help and convenience of a good &s;trong Bridge, not ruined by the Enemy, and &s;o
<PB N="555" REF="306"> advanced into the Camp, near the Village <HI>Doboy,</HI> where Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> joyned again with Prince <HI>Eugenius,</HI> advancing &s;till be|fore the &s;ame Night towards <HI>Sarai,</HI> or <HI>Se|raglio,</HI> to ob&s;erve the Place, to which great Numbers of People of that Country were fled for &s;ecurity: But becau&s;e that City was not capable to receive &s;uch Mul|titudes of People, great Numbers of them were forced to lodge before the City Gates, &s;o as the Pri&s;oners declared, which toge|ther with tho&s;e in the City, would make up a Body of 30000 Men, but they want|ed Arms very much:<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> So that tho' the Ka|hya was then per&s;onally pre&s;ent in the Ci|ty; yet his Power and Authority was weak to di&s;po&s;e Matters into any tolera|ble State and Condition of Defence.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> found this Part very Fair, Fruitful, and well Built; and there|fore the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and Inhabitants of that Land went to the Imperial Camp to ren|der them&s;elves up under their Prote|ction.</P>
<P>At the beginning of this March, on the 22d, the Troops found the Ways Narrow, Crooked, and Deep, but afterwards pa&s;|&s;ed into a more plea&s;ant Place, called <HI>Vi|&s;ega,</HI> and then repa&s;&s;ed again the River <HI>Bo&s;na,</HI> over a Bridge; at the end of which, after an Hours time they Encamped; and by this time Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> was come back with his People, who had done &s;ome Exe|cution again&s;t the Inhabitants in their March, killing &s;ome, and making Pri&s;oners of others, which put the City of <HI>Seraglio</HI> into great Amazement and Confu&s;ion, whil&s;t &s;everal Parties of the Enemy roved round the adjacent Parts, and took &s;everal Pri&s;oners; at which time a Cornet, with a Trumpeter, were &s;ent into <HI>Seraglio,</HI> to Summon the City to &s;ubmit willingly, or otherwi&s;e no Quarter &s;hould be given to a|ny of them.</P>
<P>The 23d two Parties &s;ent out the Day before, returned back again very early in the Morning, before the breaking up of the Imperial Army, bringing no News, or Advice from the Enemy: Only the Cornet gave a Relation, <HI>That as he was going to</HI> Se|raglio, <HI>for almo&s;t a Quarter of an Hours time he had met with no Body at all; but after|wards falling in among&s;t the</HI> Turks, <HI>to whom having made a Sign with his Hand, he &s;how|ed them the Writing he had with him, which were Propo&s;als for the Surrender of the City; but that he happened to &s;ee the Trumpeter killed before his own Eyes, and with much difficulty, with divers Wounds e&s;caped him|&s;elf:</HI> And farther reported, <HI>That all the In|habitants in great ha&s;te went out of</HI> Sera|glio.</P>
<P>After this the Army in a Body march|ed to the City, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had quit|ted, and abandoned, leaving none remain|ing but <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> from whom they took all they could find, but nothing of great Value, in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> had not only di&s;po&s;ed of the be&s;t of their own Goods, but likewi&s;e before their Flight had Plundered the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> and committed the Guard of the Ca|&s;tle to a Garri&s;on of 150 Men; and the &s;ame Day towards Evening a Fire broke out in the City, of which no care being taken to Extingui&s;h it, it was totally burnt and con&s;umed. The Ca&s;tle how&s;oever was not burnt, for it being built of Stone, re|quired lei&s;ure to demoli&s;h, which at that time could not be allowed.</P>
<P>How&s;oever &s;everal Parties on the 24th returned from abroad, bringing &s;ome Pri|&s;oners with them, and many poor <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> came likewi&s;e Voluntarily in, with Re|&s;olution to pa&s;s the <HI>Save,</HI> upon the Return of the Imperial Army; which happened to be on the 25th and 26th, but Colonel <HI>Kyba</HI> &s;taid, (as he u&s;ually did) &s;ome time be|hind to burn and de&s;troy every thing that remained, as yet uncon&s;umed.</P>
<P>And on the 27th they marched on, un|til they came to the Camp, which was be|fore <HI>Seniza.</HI></P>
<P>And on the 28th they entered into bad Defiles, and at length into the Valley of <HI>Orohovitz,</HI> where the Artillery and Wag|gons joyned again with the Army.</P>
<P>The 29th they Encamped near <HI>Schebze;</HI> where Advices were brought to the Gene|rals in what manner the Enemy was ga|thered into a Body near <HI>Belgrade,</HI> con&s;i|&s;ting of &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Men.</P>

<P>The 5th Day in the Morning, they &s;et in order their Batteries, and began al&s;o to throw Bombs into the Palanca, which they found to be much more &s;trong than it was believed at fir&s;t; for that it was en|compa&s;&s;ed with a double Ditch, and treble Rows of Palli&s;adoes, and a place of Re|treat guarded with 400 Men, and well provided of all things; and for the better Security, they had made &s;ome hundreds of Faggots; and in the mean time the <HI>Turks</HI> in a great Body &s;howed them&s;elves upon another Stream of the <HI>Danube</HI> above, and others at the Foot of the Mountain, near to <HI>Rham,</HI> together with Saicks, and Frigats on the River.

<P>On the 6th with dawning of the Day, appeared on the other &s;ide of the River, a great number of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Boats, bat|tering with their Cannon, as they had done all the Day before again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;ti|an</HI> Camp: And in the mean time, with the Break of Day, the Attack began in two Places at the &s;ame time; that is, upon the left Hand of the <HI>Danube,</HI> where the great|e&s;t difficulty was, under the Command of Heer <HI>Viart,</HI> Sergeant-Major of the <HI>Hano|ver</HI> Troops; and then on the right Hand, on the River <HI>Cera&s;&s;e,</HI> where the Soldiers to pa&s;s the Water, Waded up to the Middle, under the Command of Captain <HI>Beaumont,</HI> of the Regiment of <HI>Rabutin:</HI> And to give the greater Inconvenience to the Enemy, they fired their Cannons continually with|out Intermi&s;&s;ion, as al&s;o their Bombs, be&s;ides Small-&s;hot from 250 Men out of the Trenches; but in regard that in the Night before certain Recruits were &s;ent to reinforce the Place, together with a Boat, on Board of which were 100 Men from <HI>Columbas,</HI> and <HI>Isbeck,</HI> with new Ammuni|tion, &s;o that they met with very much re|&s;i&s;tance; be&s;ides, they Storm'd without making any Breach, and that in the &s;ight of 20 or 30 Saicks and Frigats, which ap|peared above and below the Place; in&s;o|much as things looked more doubtful and hazardous, than with any promi&s;ing Coun|tenance of Succe&s;s. How&s;oever General <HI>de Rabutin</HI> and Sergeant-General Count <HI>de Leiningen</HI> applyed all po&s;&s;ible care and In|du&s;try to hinder and prevent the Enemies Succours from coming upon them, by which the Soldiers at the appearance, and &s;o near an approach of their Enemies, again rea&s;&s;umed new Courage; and tho' they were at fir&s;t well enough animated, when they ob&s;erved the <HI>Turks</HI> come upon them, with their Cries of <HI>Allah, Allah,</HI> which they u&s;ually make upon their Charge, and that 400 of their Hor&s;e remained for a Re|&s;erve, the Vigour and Spirit was renewed on all &s;ides, and then with Axes and Hat|chets they cutting down the Palli&s;adoes, gained &s;o much Ground, that all things laid open before them: So that after a doubt|ful Conflict of about an Hour and a half, the Place was overcome, and taken by the Valour of the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> &s;o that not only the Commander in Chief <HI>Hay Beigh,</HI> but all the Garri&s;on, with the Inhabitants, without any Exception, were Killed, or droven into the <HI>Danube.</HI> All which was done and acted in a very &s;hort time, which was well that it &s;o happened; for had it admitted of any farther delay, the <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> would have encountred many more Difficulties, for that the <HI>Turks</HI> were bring|ing over many Succours, which would have cau&s;ed very dangerous Diver&s;ions. When on the contrary, the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t 800 Per&s;ons, and the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> only 10, which was almo&s;t a Miracle to con&s;ider.</P>
<PB N="557" REF="307">
<P>General <HI>Rabutin</HI> was always pre&s;ent on the right Hand, during the A&s;&s;ault, and after it, the better to Encourage the Soldi|ers, he alighted from his Hor&s;e, and ha|ving Commended and Prai&s;ed every one publickly in his Place according to his De&s;erts, and e&s;pecially the Sergeant-Ge|neral Count of <HI>Leiningen,</HI> who had the left Wing under his Conduct, and had done and acted as much as could be expected on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; and indeed both he and Sergeant-Major <HI>de Viart,</HI> &s;howed as much Bravery, Conduct, and Military Experience as could be de&s;ired of the greate&s;t Cap|tains in the World.</P>
<P>But now in regard this Pa&s;s of <HI>Vypalan|cha</HI> was too far within the Territory of the Enemy, to be any long time maintained; for that &s;hould the Garri&s;on be <HI>German,</HI> or <HI>Ra&s;cian,</HI> it would be too much expo&s;ed, without any po&s;&s;ibility of Relief, the Ge|neral <HI>Rabutin</HI> re&s;olved to Slight and Demo|li&s;h the Place, and accordingly he gave all up to the Flames.</P>
<P>And on the &s;eventh Day, &s;o &s;oon as the Cannon were carried away, it was put in|to execution, which was &s;oon effected by the great Numbers of Country-men and Pea&s;ants employed upon that Work; and the &s;ame Morning the Camp was removed nearer to the Palancha.</P>

<P>The&s;e Succe&s;&s;es which the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> had gained over the <HI>Turks</HI> in all Places, through the whole Cour&s;e of this Year 1697, put them into a kind of De&s;pair of being any more Victorious, but rather to yield to the Hand of God, and to fix a Pe|riod to the Limits of their Empire, which they believed, by the Providence of God, was no farther to be extended.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts put all the Great Men, and Governors of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire into &s;uch a Melancholy, that contrary to their u&s;ual Humour of Pride, and Vain Imagi|nations of Riches, and Enlargement of Empire, as if the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Arms were ne|ver to be weakened, or brought low; all the Powerful and Warlike Men, together with the Sultan, concluded, That after &s;uch a Series of Misfortunes; both by Sea and Land, God frowned on their Enterpri|&s;es, and would no longer favour their Mar|tial Proceedings: And therefore, that until
<PB N="558" REF="308"> &s;uch time as God's Anger again&s;t them was appea&s;ed, there was no &s;afety but in a Happy Peace, to be Negotiated by the only true Allies of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; namely, the Great King <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Mo&s;t Potent Lords, the States General of the Low-Countries, or United Provinces; for whom at that time, namely, for the fir&s;t the Lord <HI>Paget</HI> was then Amba&s;&s;ador at the Port; and for the latter was the Heer <HI>Colyer,</HI> both of them Per&s;ons qualified by their Offices, and long Experiences in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Affairs, to be|come Mediators and Mini&s;ters for their Powerful and Pui&s;&s;ant Ma&s;ters, in Treating a Peace of the greate&s;t Importance of any that hath happened in this, or in the pre|ceeding Age; unle&s;s it be the General Peace, in which all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> was &s;o near|ly concerned.</P>
<P>What farther moved the <HI>Turks</HI> to de&s;ire and promote this Peace, was their Ill Suc|ce&s;&s;es at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> where that Pa&s;ha, whom we have formerly mentioned, had carried for &s;ome time all before him; and tho' the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had often promi&s;ed their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Turks,</HI> for Suppre&s;&s;ion of that Re|bellion, yet nothing was acted by them in reality, until the Grand Seignior, and the whole Government became &s;en&s;ible, that nothing was to be expected of good either by War, or Peace, but by their own Negotiations; in pur&s;uance of which the Mediation &s;o often offered, was at length accepted, and put into execution at the beginning of the Year 1698.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Anno</HI> 1698.</HEAD>
<P> <MILESTONE N="1698"> THIS Year was happily begun with a Re&s;olution on all &s;ides to make the Peace:<NOTE PLACE="marg">January.</NOTE> How&s;oever at the beginning there|of things looked very frowningly, with|out that gentle Pro&s;pect, which is com|monly the Fore-runner of a Peace: For at the beginning of this Month, three Aga's were di&s;patched from <HI>Adrianople,</HI> to the Chimacam of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> with Orders to facilitate their Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> by the mo&s;t Expedite Po&s;ts that could be formed; how&s;oever in their Pa&s;&s;age they entered into Conferences with the Chief Mini&s;ters at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> giving them to under|&s;tand, That they had Orders to Summon the <HI>Tartar Han,</HI> to appear in Conference at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> with the Sultan, Mufti, and Grand Vizier, who&s;e Opinions and Re&s;o|lutions were at fir&s;t to continue the War; which they declared them&s;elves very a|ble to do; for tho' it was true, that they had lo&s;t the be&s;t part and the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing of their Jani&s;aries, and Infantry, yet their Cavalry was almo&s;t entire, and able to Engage the Enemy with an Advantage; and were able to form a better Army this, than the la&s;t Year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar Han</HI> declared, That he did not fear the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> &s;o much as he did the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> and the <HI>Poles,</HI> but of them they are in no great Apprehen&s;ions nei|ther; for that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador had promi&s;ed and a&s;&s;ured them, That the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> &s;hould &s;o di&s;turb the Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> that no danger needed to be feared from that People.</P>
<P>And now to &s;trengthen the&s;e Propo&s;als, the Sultan decreed, That new Contributi|ons &s;hould be required over all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and Men of great Authority were &s;ent with Bands and Troops of Segmen, and other Militia, to rai&s;e the Money by force and power.</P>
<P>Orders were al&s;o &s;ent to the Chimacam of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to put the Forges of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> at work for founding great quan|tities of Cannon.</P>
<P>And that the Maritime Affairs might not be neglected, <HI>Mezzo Morto</HI> was conti|nued in the Office of Captain-Pa&s;ha, or Admiral, with Orders, and In&s;tructions to &s;ight the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all things looked as if nothing had been intended be&s;ides a War. How|&s;oever the Great God of Ho&s;ts, in who&s;e Hands remains the Balance of Peace and War, having de&s;igned otherwi&s;e, and at length to give repo&s;e, and re&s;t after &s;o long Wars, to the Nations of the Earth, was plea&s;ed in his Divine Providence to di|rect a Conference in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> between the Great Vizier, the <HI>Tartar Han,</HI> and the Mufti, at <HI>Adrianople,</HI> who having con&s;idered of the many Difficulties under which the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire laboured, gave it as their Opinions to the Sultan, that there could be no &s;afety to either, but in a Peace, for which they produced many Rea&s;ons, but none of greater force than that for this Year, no A&s;&s;i&s;tance could be expected from <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> nor was it po&s;&s;ible to recruit in one Years time, the lo&s;t Body of the Jani&s;a|ries, which is the Nerve of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Militia; in which Opinion the Chimacam of <HI>Adrianople,</HI> called <HI>Mu&s;tapha Pa&s;ha,</HI> who had formerly been Grand Vizier, concur|red with the others, and all of them joyn|ing together in the &s;ame Opinion, made their Applications to the Sultan, giving him to under&s;tand, That having duly con|&s;idered of this important matter, nothing &s;eemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as a Peace, which God
<PB N="559" REF="308"> had now plea&s;ed in his Goodne&s;s, for the Comfort and Relief of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Cau&s;e, to offer unto them: The which Declaration and Coun&s;el of the&s;e Great Men made to the Sultan, took &s;o much a|mong&s;t the People, that the Report &s;lew like Lightning, and in five Days time was divulged almo&s;t over all the Empire.</P>
<P>All the Per&s;ons that were pre&s;ent at this private Conference, were the Mufti, <HI>Han</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> Aga of the Jani&s;aries, Aga of the Spahees, and Grand Vizier, and the Sul|tan him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To make &s;ome little appearance of un|willingne&s;s to make a Peace, as if they had been able to continue the War, they &s;ent away towards <HI>Belgrade,</HI> &s;ome Field|pieces of Bra&s;s, which had been lately Ca&s;t, or Founded; and on that Occa&s;ion 15 Chambers of Jani&s;aries, with their Ci|urbagees, or Captains, of which every Chamber con&s;i&s;ted of 100 Men, but were computed in all to make up 2200 Jani&s;a|ries, 200 Zebegees, or Armourers, 70 Gunners, which were commanded by a certain Per&s;on, called <HI>Ali Pa&s;ha,</HI> who was Brother in Law to the late Grand Vizier: It was reported, That all the Chambers had their full and compleat Numbers, but upon the true Computation, they were found to be much &s;hort, and not above 70 in a Chamber; by this kind of Computa|tion, the poor E&s;tate of the other Militias of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army being to be judged, made the Propo&s;ition of a Peace to become much more acceptable to all Sorts and Con|ditions of Men: One Evidence of which, was the readine&s;s and ha&s;te the Grand Seignior and Vizier &s;howed to be upon their March towards <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>In order to which, it was appointed, That the Aga of the Jani&s;aries, &s;hould on the 6th of <HI>June</HI> begin their March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> and that the Sultan &s;hould follow two Days af|terwards being the 8th; for that already towards the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> all the Ca|mels, and Hor&s;es, which were provided to carry the Tents and Baggage, were arrived at <HI>Adrianople.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance whereof the Grand Seig|nior, and Grand Vizier, began their March on the 8th of <HI>June,</HI> when it was &s;uppo&s;ed, That taking <HI>Sophia</HI> in their way, and making that Place a Quarter of &s;ome Days Repo&s;e, there to Celebrate the Fea&s;t of their little <HI>Biram,</HI> they might arrive at <HI>Belgrade</HI> by the 15th of <HI>July;</HI> when all the Army of the <HI>Turks</HI> could not amount to more than 40000 Men, tho' they &s;hould receive an Addition of 10000 Men from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which was the greate&s;t Number of Soldiers that they could expect this Year from tho&s;e Parts, and hereof many Hun|dreds failed of making up that Number. How&s;oever in regard that the Peace in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> and other Parts with the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> was almo&s;t &s;ecure and certain, it rais'd a Chearfulne&s;s among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;o that they little regarded any Apprehen&s;ions of a War again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> or their Con|junction with <HI>Bebek Sulyman,</HI> a Bold, In|&s;olent, Daring Per&s;on, who lived on the Confines of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> whom the <HI>Turks</HI> de&s;i|red might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Per&s;ians:</HI> But the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, notwith&s;tand|ing the great Treatments and Civilities he had received from the <HI>Turks,</HI> made &s;ome Difficulties thereof, &s;aying, <HI>That it could not be fore&s;een, or mea&s;ured, how far &s;uch a War as this might go; this</HI> Bebek Sulyman <HI>being a mo&s;t Pe&s;tilent Fellow, feared as well as beloved, by all the</HI> Arabian <HI>Princes; &s;o that a War with him might cau&s;e much Blood.</HI></P>
<P>How&s;oever the <HI>Turks</HI> pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly to have this <HI>Sulyman</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, al|ledging, Both the Honour and Safety of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> was concerned: And to En|courage them herein, the Grand Vizier promi&s;ed them the Sultan's A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for that having now made a Peace with the Emperor, and the other <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> (as might be pre&s;umed to be) his Hands were at liberty to carry the War into what Parts of the World that he &s;hould think fit; which he &s;hould not more readily do to any Region, than again&s;t tho&s;e who might be trouble&s;ome on the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and bring Di&s;turbance to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port.</P>
<P>Such Friendly Di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ing between the Grand Vizier, and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, a Promi&s;e was farther made unto him, <HI>That the Sultan would not deny any thing to the King of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>which might be of &s;atisfaction to him; being re&s;olved to cultivate a mo&s;t &s;incere, and la&s;ting Friend|&s;hip with him, according to the Capitulations lately made and agreed between tho&s;e two Great and Mighty Monarchs.</HI></P>
<P>After which they did Eat, and Fea&s;ted together, with high Expre&s;&s;ions of Love, and a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip; in farther Confir|mation of which, a Pre&s;ent was made to the Amba&s;&s;ador of another Hor&s;e, well Equipped with a Rich and Noble Furni|ture, and then the <HI>Tefter Emini,</HI> who was de&s;igned to be Amba&s;&s;ador from the Sul|tan to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and was prepa|ring for his Journey, was introduced into their Pre&s;ence, that an Acquaintance might be begun between them; the which was ea&s;ily effected, con&s;idering that the <HI>Tefter Emini</HI> was a Per&s;on of a good Addre&s;s, and
<PB N="560" REF="309"> Skilful, and Practi&s;ed in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lan|guage; he was a Refined Per&s;on, and fit, and proper for &s;uch an Emba&s;&s;y as this to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court, whom the Grand Vizier had Cho&s;en, and Elected for this Employ|ment; for which he was preparing him&s;elf with fine Hor&s;es of Price, well Equipped with rich Embroidered Saddles, with Arms inlaid with Jewels, and other Gallantries, which might &s;erve for Pre&s;ents at his Arri|val at the Court of <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, &s;uch as Quivers, Bows, and Ar|rows.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all which kind Treatment, the Grand Seignior him&s;elf Treated him at his Tents without the City of <HI>Adrianople;</HI> as al&s;o did the Chimacam of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> at his Palace on the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> or <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we may &s;ee how freely and frank|ly the <HI>Turks</HI> Treated the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> at this time; for now having &s;ecured the Peace with the We&s;tern Princes in <HI>Hungary,</HI> who were much more formidable at all times than the Ea&s;tern Nations: How&s;oever, that no Advantages might be taken nei|ther on that &s;ide, &s;trict Commands and wi&s;e In&s;tructions were &s;ent to the Beilerbey of <HI>Gran Cairo,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Courage, Wi&s;dom, and Experience, one of the Sul|tan's Bed-Chamber, to take the Care and Charge of tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Kingdoms, gi|ving him al&s;o the Title of Seraskier, or General, and Beylerbey of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Baby|lon,</HI> with Orders forthwith to form an Army with the People of the Country, and therewith to Attack <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and drive out from thence the Rebellious Pa&s;ha, and &s;et|tle in his Place another Pa&s;ha Commi&s;&s;io|nated by the Port to &s;ucceed in his Em|ployment, with a Hatte&s;heriff from the Sultan: But principally above all things it was recommended to him, to hinder and prevent all Incur&s;ions of Rebel <HI>Sulyman</HI> upon the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who being good Friends to the Sultan, he could not permit, or &s;uf|fer, that they &s;hould receive any Affront, or Injury, from &s;uch as go under the De|nomination of Subjects to the Port.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Ea&s;tern Countries &s;o far di|&s;tant as <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> were not now the care of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who&s;e Thoughts were wholly taken up in what manner they might fini&s;h the War with the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which were divers; as with the Emperor, the <HI>Veneti|ans,</HI> the Old and Irreconcileable Enemies to the Port; al&s;o with the <HI>Polanders,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;covites,</HI> the latter of which were not much known to the World, either for Friends, or Foes, tho' they began now un|der the pre&s;ent Czar by the taking of <HI>A&s;ac,</HI> and &s;ome other Actions, to make them|&s;elves known to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and other Na|tions of the World.</P>
<P>It being now re&s;olved on all &s;ides to make the Peace, the Mediators who were to manage the Treaty, were nominated and appointed, and the mo&s;t proper Per|&s;ons e&s;teemed to be the Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> both of which ha|ving never been Engaged in the War on any of the &s;ides, but had always been true and ancient Friends to the Port, the <HI>Turks</HI> could have no Objections to alledge again&s;t either, nor had the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Princes any cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the Faith and Friend&s;hip of two &s;uch Amba&s;&s;adors, who&s;e Offices and Per&s;ons were acceptable to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and not di&s;plea&s;ing to the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>The Names of the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors de&s;ign|ed to this &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary and Mo&s;t Honour|able Employment, were the Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador for <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and the Heer <HI>Colyer,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador for the Lords the States of the <HI>United Pro|vinces.</HI></P>
<P>All Matters being now ripe for Action, and a willing mind for Execution, the <HI>Turks</HI> moved with their Camp on the 11th of <HI>June</HI> 1698. commanded by the Grand Vi|zier, (the Grand Seignior &s;till remaining behind in his Tent) and with them al&s;o moved the two Amba&s;&s;adors with their Equipages: And to put every thing into a good po&s;ture, and a way of Di&s;patch, the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador's Secretary was di&s;patch|ed away a &s;econd time, as he had been the fir&s;t on the 10th of <HI>May</HI> for <HI>Vienna,</HI> from whence he returned on the 5th of <HI>July</HI> to <HI>Sophia;</HI> where on the &s;ame Day he there met with the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Pa|get,</HI> to whom he Communicated the good News of the Happy Inclinations of the Emperor and that Court towards the Peace: But that no delay &s;hould be made therein, the &s;ame Secretary was again di&s;patched a|way, to ha&s;ten the Emperor's Amba&s;&s;a|dors to the Place appointed, and agreed up|on for the Treaty, and to procure, and bring with him Pa&s;&s;es, and &s;afe Conducts for the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries, who were the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> Chief Chancellor, or Se|cretary; and <HI>Maurocordato,</HI> who was the principal and fir&s;t Interpreter to the Grand Seignior.</P>

<P>At length the Mouth of <HI>October</HI> being entered, the Proclamation of Neutrality was fir&s;t publi&s;hed at <HI>Peter Waradin,</HI> to the great Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction of all Peo|ple, both <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> and after|wards at <HI>Belgrade.</HI></P>
<P>On the 9/19th of <HI>October,</HI> the Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador left their Camp near the City, rai&s;ed on an Eminence, where was a good Air, and a good Pro|&s;pect over the Countries round about; and upon the &s;ame Day early in the Morn|ing they pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Save,</HI> a River which runs from <HI>Bo&s;nia,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> where it lo&s;es its Name.</P>

<P>After which followed two Flags, one with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coat of Arms, and the other was a large Red Cro&s;s in a White Field.</P>

<P>Then came up the two Interpreters at|tending His Excellency the Lord Amba&s;&s;a|dor, on each &s;ide of his Hor&s;e, and they attended with two <HI>Heydukes</HI> in their own Country Habit; and on both &s;ides 10 <HI>Chiohadars,</HI> or Servants, who carry the Cloaks, or Ve&s;ts of the Great Men, in White Ve&s;ts, with their Carbines on their Shoulders.</P>

<P>About an Hour after the&s;e Matters had pa&s;&s;ed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador followed, and was u&s;ed with the &s;ame Civility as tho&s;e preceding.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Amba&s;&s;adors, becau&s;e they &s;ent Pa&s;&s;ports to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adors Signed by the Emperor's Hand, de|&s;ired to have others Signed by the Sultan: But becau&s;e it was con&s;idered that this ex|change of Pa&s;&s;ports would take up a great deal of time, the Mediators found out, and agreed upon this Expedient, That the Pro|clamation being made in both the Emperors Names, no Pa&s;&s;ports &s;hould be delivered, either from the <HI>Germans</HI> to the <HI>Turks,</HI> or from the <HI>Turks</HI> to the <HI>Germans;</HI> but that a Pleni-power &s;hould be given to the Midia|tors to grant Pa&s;&s;ports to People, who were going up and down within the Limits of Neutrality agreed on both &s;ides: So the <HI>German</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors re&s;olved to go to <HI>Car|lowitz</HI> within three Days time, tho' their Wooden Hou&s;es were not arrived as yet.</P>
<P>The Mediators al&s;o agreed upon the &s;ame, and to place them&s;elves &s;o, that their Doors might be over again&s;t each other at a good di&s;tance, whereby the <HI>Turks</HI> re|mained wholly on the <HI>Belgrade</HI> &s;ide, and the <HI>Germans</HI> towards <HI>Peter Waradin.</HI></P>
<P>The 11/21&s;t the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador arri|ved at <HI>Futack,</HI> but the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor, after their unthinking manner, came directly the &s;ame Day to <HI>Peter Waradin,</HI> without giving the Governour Notice of his coming; by which Neglect of the <HI>Mo&s;covite,</HI> no Salutes were pa&s;&s;ed on him, of which he complained to the Governour; but that was ea&s;ily an&s;wered, by &s;aying, <HI>That he knew nothing of his coming down the River, and therefore hoped to be excu|&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, To Accommodate this Matter, it was agreed, That the Boats of the <HI>Mo&s;|covites</HI> &s;hould remove from the place where they fir&s;t Landed, and by a Signal given by the Amba&s;&s;ador's Trumpets, the Guns &s;hould be fired, which was done both from the Ca&s;tle, the Town, and the Fleet.</P>

<P>Upon the Arrival of the Mediators at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> they were received by the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot, and a Captain-Lieu|tenant and a Standard, with 50 Hor&s;e, and al&s;o with another Captain-Lieutenant, and an En&s;ign, with 70 Foot, which were ap|pointed to each Amba&s;&s;ador for the Medi|ators Guards.

<P>On the 20/30th the Plenipotentiaries were &s;howed to each other; and &s;hortly after the Conferences began; but fir&s;t the Pre|parations were making for building the Hou&s;e for Conferences: But in the mean time to &s;upply that Convenience, a great Tent was rais'd in the mid&s;t of that void place which was between the Tents of the Mediators; where it was farther ordered, That in&s;tead of Chambers for the &s;everal Parties, there &s;hould be Tents pitched on both &s;ides.</P>

<P>On the 2/13 of <HI>November,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador from the Emperor, appeared in the Camp of <HI>Carlovitz;</HI> as al&s;o did tho&s;e from the Sultan, who placed them&s;elves on both &s;ides, not far from the Hou&s;e appointed for the Conferences to be held, and not far from the Places where the Mediators had their Lodgings, in which void Places &s;everal Magnificent and Stately Tents were erected; at which, about nine of the Clock in the Morning, the Emperor's Amba&s;&s;a|dor arrived, being attended with four Coaches of State, and a Numerous Re|tinue.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place they went to the Tents of the Mediators, where at the &s;ame time appeared the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, attended with a very &s;tately Retinue of Cavaliers, well mounted on Hor&s;es of the fine&s;t Shapes that could be found in all Quarters of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> World, and be|&s;ides their Cloathing which was very rich, they made as beautiful an Appearance, as the <HI>Germans</HI> had done before them: And both Parties at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented them&s;elves before the Mediators, in the Tent appointed for the Conferences: Where after the Salutations, and Comple|ments on both &s;ides, &s;ufficiently Courte|ous and Obliging, they took their Seats in the middle of the Tent, purpo&s;ely &s;et, and laid for them, one directly again&s;t the o|ther, in &s;uch a manner, that no Per&s;on could take Exception again&s;t his Place, or Seat appointed for him.</P>
<P>This being agreed and &s;etled, the fir&s;t Conference began, which was to determine this Great and Solemn Peace, which was the fir&s;t of this kind, that ever pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and the <HI>Turks;</HI> not but that &s;everal Treaties and Conclu&s;ions of Articles had pa&s;&s;ed before, but not on &s;uch equal Terms, and with &s;o much Ho|nour, and Deference given to <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Mediators, which will be recorded in all Ages, to the Glory of <HI>William the Third,</HI> King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of the States-General, His Worthy and Wi&s;e Al|lies.</P>
<P>Nor will it be le&s;s Memorable in Ho|nour of that Noble and Ancient Family of the Lord <HI>Paget;</HI> who with the Heer <HI>Colyer,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the Lords the States-Ge|neral of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> bore &s;o great a &s;hare in this Everla&s;ting, and never to be forgotten Treaty.</P>
<P>The Tent appointed for this Congre&s;s had four Doors, which fronted each other, at one of which entered the Imperial Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and at the oppo&s;ite thereunto en|tered the <HI>Turki&s;h;</HI> and at the two others, which were likewi&s;e oppo&s;ite, entered the Mediators.</P>
<P>The Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador, was Named the Mo&s;t Excellent Lord the Count of <HI>Ot|tingen:</HI> And on the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> &s;ide was the <HI>Reis Effendi,</HI> which I take to be principal Secretary of State with us.</P>
<P>Behind the Emperor's Amba&s;&s;ador the Secretary of the Emba&s;&s;y was placed; as al&s;o at a &s;mall Table behind the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mediator, was placed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Secreta|ry: And behind the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Secretary, called <HI>Mauro Cordato,</HI> by Extraction a <HI>Greek,</HI> and of that Rite, or Religion; he &s;tood a while behind the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador upon his Legs, but af|terwards was ordered to &s;it on the Ground after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion; both which Se|cretaries took the Minutes, or <HI>Protocollo</HI> of what was propounded, or what pa&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Doors of the Tent was on all &s;ides guarded equally by <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> and both filled up the Doors of the Tent, among&s;t which were many Commanding Officers, who had room &s;ufficient to &s;ee every thing that pa&s;&s;ed: The Conferences began commonly about ten a Clock, or half an Hour pa&s;t ten in the Morning, and la&s;ted until half an Hour pa&s;t two in the Afternoon: And then ended the fir&s;t Day of Conference.</P>
<P>On the 4/14th the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger by way of <HI>Peter Waradin</HI> towards the Places where the Re|giment of <HI>Corbelli,</HI> and the two Battalions of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> and <HI>Turcheim,</HI> were Quartered, which were &s;etled there for Guards near to the Congre&s;s; as al&s;o for the &s;ame rea|&s;on had appointed 200 Hor&s;e of the fir&s;t Rank, and 100 Foot of the &s;econd: Like|wi&s;e the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters remanded to <HI>Bel|grade</HI> as many of their People, as they could well &s;pare.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day that this Exchange was made, the Plenipotentiaries from the Sul|tan not being u&s;ed to &s;it upon Stools, or Chairs, but very unea&s;ily, cau&s;ed a Safraw to be placed for them, covered with rich Carpets, and Embroidered Cu&s;hions, upon which they &s;ate Cro&s;s-legg'd after the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>After which the Company ri&s;ing, the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador went to Dinner with the Mediators, where having remained for the &s;pace of about two Hours, they returned to the Conference about three a Clock, which continued until half an Hour pa&s;t four in the Evening.</P>
<PB N="564" REF="311">
<P>The next Day being the 5/15, the Impe|rial Amba&s;&s;ador appeared at the place of the Conference in mo&s;t Rich and Pompous Habit in Honour to the Day, which was the Emperor's Birth-Day; and which af|ter the Conference was ended, was ho|noured with a mo&s;t &s;plendid and &s;tately Dinner, and Entertainment.</P>
<P>The 6/18 the Plenipotentiaries again a&s;|&s;embled about ten a Clock in the Morn|ing, which continued with much diligence until eight a Clock in the Evening.</P>
<P>The 7/17th the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador came for the fir&s;t time with a mo&s;t &s;plendid E|quipage to the Conference, in which that whole Day was entirely &s;pent.</P>
<P>On the 7/17th, the <HI>Turks</HI> made a Propo&s;i|tion to have the Principality of <HI>Tran&s;ylva|nia</HI> to be re&s;tored to its pri&s;tine State and Condition, but &s;o as to remain under the Emperor's Protection; but this Point was po&s;itively rejected by the Imperiali&s;ts, the which not taking.</P>
<P>On the 11/21, the <HI>Turks</HI> made another Of|fer about this Principality, leaving it wholly in the Power and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Emperor, &s;tipulating how&s;oever, That an Honorary Tribute &s;hould be paid unto the Port for the &s;ame, but this was likewi&s;e rejected by the Imperiali&s;ts: For the truth is, the Emperor would hearken to nothing which could give the <HI>Turks</HI> any Footing or Demand upon <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> which is the Entrance, and the Lock and Key into the <HI>Upper Hungary,</HI> and into <HI>Germany</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>So on the 14/24, after long Debates on both &s;ides, the Point of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> was agreed in the &s;ame manner as propo&s;ed by the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>The 15/25th was entirely &s;pent upon the Argument of the Limits, in which things were &s;o prepared, that</P>
<P>On the 16/16th a good progre&s;s was made about the Regulation of the Confines; and before they aro&s;e, or &s;eparated for that E|vening, it was agreed, which of the other Allies &s;hould have their Bu&s;ine&s;s come next to the Conference, and was agreed, That it &s;hould be the <HI>Venetians,</HI> which was the more ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ented unto, becau&s;e they had agreed with the Imperiali&s;ts to treat upon the Foot of <HI>Uti Po&s;&s;idetis.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly on the 17/17, the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors met the <HI>Turks,</HI> and had a long Conference with them, but the <HI>Turks</HI> ma|king &s;ome new Demands, which the Am|ba&s;&s;adors not being prepared to an&s;wer, or to gratifie them in, it ended for that Day without any Determination.</P>
<P>The 18/28th, the <HI>Venetians</HI> renewed their former Conference, where the &s;ame Diffi|culties offering and not removed, all end|ed again without any farther po&s;itive Re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>The 19/29 the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador went to Conference, in which having held a Di&s;cour&s;e only in general Terms, without entering upon Particulars, nothing was concluded, or determined for that Day.</P>
<P>The 20/30 was &s;pent by the Mediators in going between the Plenipotentiaries to di&s;|po&s;e them towards the ultimate Agree|ment.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> or fir&s;t of <HI>De|cember,</HI> the Imperiali&s;ts had a Conference with the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Morning, at which they proceeded yet farther in adju&s;ting and &s;etling the Limits of each Empire: And the &s;ame Day in the Afternoon the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador went to Conference; at which his Di&s;cour&s;e was loo&s;e and general, &s;o that nothing was concluded for that time.</P>
<P>The next Day being the 22d of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> or the 2d of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador had another Conference with the <HI>Turks,</HI> who pretended the Ce&s;&s;ion, or Demolition of the Places Conquered by the Czar, but that Demand was rejected, the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;aying, <HI>That he would nei|ther give unto, nor take any thing from the</HI> Turks; <HI>but that his Ma&s;ter required the Fortre&s;s of</HI> Keres <HI>from the Cham of</HI> Tar|tary.</P>
<P>The 23d of <HI>November,</HI> or the 3d of <HI>De|cember,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Poland</HI> began to abate, and remit &s;omething of his high Demands, which gave &s;ome hopes of an Accommodation between the <HI>Poles</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> in ca&s;e an Equivalent could be found for the Town and Fortre&s;s of <HI>Ca|minieck.</HI></P>
<P>The 24/4 in the Afternoon the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador had a Conference which la&s;ted until Night, but could come to no &s;atisfa|ctory Re&s;olution; the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;till adhering
<PB N="565" REF="311"> to their Demands, that &s;everal places &s;hould be razed, which are in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> which the Amba&s;&s;a|dor alledged that he had not power to grant.</P>
<P>The 25/5th the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador went again to Conference, after which, it was ob&s;erved, That the <HI>Turks</HI> di&s;patch|ed an Expre&s;s Courier to the Port there|upon.</P>
<P>The 26/6 in the Afternoon, the Imperia|li&s;ts went again to Conference, but con|cluded nothing for that time.</P>
<P>The 28/8 the Imperiali&s;ts had another Conference with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which held from nine a Clock in the Morning, till five in the Afternoon; during which time the Articles between the Emperor and the Sul|tan were for the mo&s;t part agreed.</P>
<P>The 29/9th the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador held another Conference with the <HI>Turks,</HI> but that Day was for the mo&s;t part &s;pent in Debates without any conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The 30/10th my Lord <HI>Paget</HI> went to the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in the Morning, and to the Imperiali&s;ts in the Afternoon, en|deavouring to di&s;po&s;e both Parties to a Peace.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 1/11th the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador had this Day the tenth Conference with the <HI>Turks,</HI> at which the remaining Articles were debated and agreed, &s;o that little or nothing was wanting to perfect the Em|peror's Treaty.</P>
<P>On the 2/12th the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was at Conference from 10 a Clock to 12 at Noon: At which the <HI>Turks</HI> required the Demolition, and Re&s;titution of <HI>Dogan Ca|lu&s;i,</HI> and three other Forts which the Czar holds upon the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> to which the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> would give no ear; how&s;oever they relinqui&s;hed their Preten&s;ions upon <HI>Keres;</HI> &s;o that it was not doubted but that a Medium might now be ea&s;ily found to compo&s;e Matters remaining.</P>
<P>The 3/13th was &s;pent by the Mediators in trying to rectifie &s;ome Mi&s;takes and Mi&s;under&s;tandings which might remove &s;ome Difficulties.</P>
<P>The 4/14th the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was at Conference, at which four Articles were drawn and agreed unto.</P>
<P>In one of which there was yielded unto the <HI>Turks</HI> the Ca&s;tles which the <HI>Poles</HI> then had, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in <HI>Moldavia.</HI></P>
<P>In another, it was agreed, That in Ex|change for tho&s;e Ca&s;tles, the &s;trong For|tre&s;s of <HI>Caminieck,</HI> and the Provinces of <HI>Podolia,</HI> and <HI>Ukrania,</HI> &s;hould be Surren|dered into the Hands of the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>The 5/15 was &s;pent in preparing Matters for a farther Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The 6/16 the Imperiali&s;ts went to Confe|rence with an Intention to reduce the Ar|ticles which were already agreed, into or|der, but the <HI>Turks</HI> not having fully fini&s;hed the Tran&s;lation of them, it was deferred to another Convention.</P>
<P>On the 7/17th, the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> delivered in|to the Hands of my Lord <HI>Paget,</HI> the Arti|cles which he had promi&s;ed to con&s;ign to the Mediation.</P>

<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador al&s;o declared, That he would leave <HI>Peter Waradin</HI> on the 2/12th of <HI>February;</HI> and in three or four Days after which, the Mediators declared, That the Place of Congre&s;s was likely to be quite cleared.</P>

<HEAD>The La&s;t Account of Count TEKELY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TEKELY</HI> was a Count of the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and one of the mo&s;t Ancient Families thereof, and one of the mo&s;t Zealous Profe&s;&s;ors, and A&s;&s;ertors of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion, which cau&s;ed him to joyn with the <HI>Turks,</HI> through the whole Cour&s;e of the la&s;t Wars, of which we have given an ample Account in the due places of this Hi&s;tory, whereby appear the great Services which this Noble Per&s;on did them, and how ill and barbarou&s;ly they &s;ometimes u&s;ed him.</P>
<P>I have particularly in&s;tanced how this pre&s;ent Sultan being at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> where having occa&s;ion for this <HI>Tekely</HI>'s Services, he &s;ent a Capugi-ba&s;hee or two, to fetch him thither from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where he had Lodged him&s;elf for Recovery of his Health, being informed by the Phy&s;icians at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,</HI> that the Air of that City was much better than that of <HI>Adrianople.</HI> The Officers who are &s;ent from the Grand Seig|nior to execute any of his Commands, do commonly perform them without any Con&s;ideration, or Ceremony, or Re&s;pect to the Per&s;on to whom they are &s;ent, and &s;o they did to <HI>Tekely,</HI> whom finding in his Bed, labouring under a grievous Fit of the Gout, they rudely forced him to ari&s;e, and without any Remor&s;e, threw him into a Waggon, and hurried him away to <HI>Bel|grade,</HI> to receive &s;uch Commands as the Grand Seignior had to employ him in; and on all Occa&s;ions as the hopes of a Peace appeared, the Neglects put upon him did daily increa&s;e.</P>
<P>It is commonly the Humour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> after they have done with the Ser|vice of any Per&s;on, never more to treat them kindly, nor if they can to &s;uffer them to Live: Of which we have a fre&s;h In&s;tance by Letters of the 15th of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which tell us, That the Chimacam of that place had re|ceived an Expre&s;s Command, or Decree, from the Sultan, to Exile or Bani&s;h <HI>Tekely,</HI> into &s;ome I&s;land of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>At the fir&s;t coming of this News <HI>Tekely</HI> was &s;trangely Surpri&s;ed, and was half Dead with the Apprehen&s;ions thereof; the Remembrance of his Journey to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and Terrours thereof, were &s;carce out of his Mind, before another Scene of Bani&s;hment was pre&s;ented to him, into an I&s;land where was no Su&s;tenance fit for his Weak Indi|&s;po&s;ed Body, nor no Con&s;olation, or Com|fort to be expected from Society, or Con|ver&s;ation of Mankind; nor yet from his Wife neither, who, poor Lady, by this hard U&s;age, was &s;truck with an A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and both joyned together in their loud Exclamations again&s;t the Ingrati|tude, and Tyranny of Princes, who have no Tenderne&s;s of Compa&s;&s;ion for any but them&s;elves; for if they had had, they would never have expo&s;ed two &s;uch Noble Families unto Ruine and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>After all which Hard&s;hip, it is believed, that the <HI>Turks</HI> will &s;carce &s;uffer them to ar|rive unto the Place of their Bani&s;hment, but by the way take their Lives, as hath been the Practi&s;e commonly among&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> on the like Occa&s;ions. And this &s;ad Account &s;hall &s;uffice to put an end to the many Tragedies of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
