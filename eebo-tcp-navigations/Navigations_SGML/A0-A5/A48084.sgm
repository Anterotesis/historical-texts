<HEAD>A LETTER FROM THE COMMANDERS AND OFFICERS of the FLEET of this <HI>COMMON-WEALTH,</HI> un to General <HI>Monck in</HI> SCOTLAND</HEAD>
<P>THE deep &s;en&s;e we have of the duty in|cumbent on us in this day of <HI>Englands</HI> fears, tryals and temptations, puts us up|on this Application to your Honour unto whom not long &s;ince mo&s;t of us had a more immediate relation, and the experience we had then of your readine&s;s to receive and grant our ju&s;t de&s;ires, gives us encouragement to be|leive this pre&s;ent tender will have the like Re|&s;entment.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>As private Members of this Common-wealth, we cannot but take notice of, and in &s;ecret be|wail before the Lord, the inte&s;tine divi&s;ions that are among&s;t us at this day; and the dreadfull con&s;equence likely to en&s;ue thereupon, when duely pondered, do exceedingly afflict, and even break our hearts.</P>
<P>All the force, that the common Enemy, (whil'&s;t in his &s;trength) were able to mu&s;ter up again&s;t the good people of this Nation, either at home or fro~ abroad, could never rai&s;e &s;uch clouds of fears, nor impre&s;&s;e tho&s;e terrors on our hearts, as we nowly under fro~ the apprehen&s;ion of that evill which attends that di&s;tance, which is be|tween you, and the Army in <HI>England,</HI> which being manife&s;ted to us by a declaration lately &s;ent from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and publi&s;hed by your Com|mand and re&s;olutions therein expre&s;&s;ed, of your vindicaing the late Parliament in oppo&s;ition to the general proceeding of the General Coun|cils of Officers here. We have taken the bold|ne&s;&s;e not only as private Chri&s;tians, but in our publick capacity as Officers of the Fleet to be|&s;eech you (in the bowels of mercy and com|pa&s;&s;ion to this your native Country, and e&s;pe|cially to all the Lords people therein, who&s;e intere&s;t we remember hath formerly been precitious to you.) &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether the undertaking you are ingaged in, will not make the hearts of the righ|teous in the&s;e Nations &s;ad, whom the Lord hath not made &s;ad, and &s;trengthen the
<PB N="3" REF="4"> hands of the wicked, that he &s;hould not return from his wicked way; It being ob|vious to us where ever we come, that few or none take plea&s;ure in your proceedings but the Cavaleers, who make their boa&s;t of you, &amp; place their co~fidence in you, which as it is irke&s;ome to us to hear, &s;o we tru&s;t, and &s;hall pray, that the Lord will pre&s;erve you from &s;uch a defection, as knowing that never any pro&s;pered that helped them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether this &s;udden Re&s;olution again&s;t your Brethren of the Army on account of their late tran&s;actions, have not &s;ome pro|portion with what the I&s;raelites intended again&s;t the Tribes of <HI>Ruben, Gad,</HI> and half tribe of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eth,</HI> when they had built an Altar of Memorial on this &s;ide <HI>Jordan,</HI> and whether the &s;ame means, (if u&s;ed by you for information of matter of fact as by them) might not through the Lords ble&s;&s;ing have the &s;ame effect, and thereby not only bloud&s;hed be prevented, but the work of Reformation carryed on.</P>
<P>And truly though we &s;hall not undertake to ju&s;tifie the Army in their late Action, as being very unable to judge of &s;uch important affairs, (not having been of their Council (yet we hope that in the integrity of their heart, and inno|cency of their hands, they have done this thing which we apprehend to be the ground of your di&s;&s;atisfaction; And on this occa&s;ion we crave
<PB N="4" REF="5"> leave to remind you, that as you were &s;atisfied with the former di&s;&s;olution of this very Parlia|ment in the year 1653. and were plea&s;ed to con|tinue your command at Sea in that Juncture, (when as the undertaking of the late Lord General <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not &s;o clear to others) and through the ble&s;&s;ing of God obtained two &s;ignal Victories again&s;t the Dutch, even in that <HI>Inter|regnum,</HI> &s;o we earne&s;tly de&s;ire you will hearken unto, and receive &s;atisfaction from, the Officers of the Army, in what they have to offer in this particular.</P>
<P N="3">3. We humbly offer to con&s;ideration, whether in your own Ob&s;ervation, it be not appa|rent, that this Army have in their actings hitherto Cordially de&s;igned the advance|ment of Gods glory, and the promoting and incoragement of godline&s;s and vertue though in per&s;ons of different judge|ments, and per&s;wa&s;ions, and whether the cau&s;e of God, and his people hath not hereby been pre&s;erved, and maintained a|gain&s;t all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether by &s;uch an undertaking (if pro&s;e|cuted,) the Common Enemy in <HI>Scotland</HI> will not &s;oon recover &s;trength, and be|come as obnoxious to <HI>England,</HI> as in for|mer times, though of late through your &s;ingular prudence indu&s;try and care they have been kept under.</P>
<P>And whether the e&s;pou&s;ing of an intere&s;t (di|&s;tinct from your brethren of the Army in <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5"> as is reported) contrary to tho&s;e righteous prin|ciples, that have hitherto been contended for, will not (in&s;tead of purcha&s;ing our de&s;ired Li|berties) render the good people of the&s;e Nations to a condition of perfect thraldome, &amp; bondage.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Affaires being &s;uch in our weak ap|prehen&s;ions we have taken this freedom to un|bo&s;om our hearts to your Honour, and &s;hall earne&s;tly pray they may take &s;ome place with you, in order to the begetting of a good Under|&s;tanding, and agreement between your &s;elf, and your brethren here, that both you and they, as al&s;o our &s;elves in our &s;everal &s;tations by Land and Sea, may with one heart, and con&s;ent be found doing the Lords Work in this pre&s;ent Ge|neration, in oppo&s;ition to all Corrupt intere&s;ts what&s;oever; In attending whereunto, a ble&s;|&s;ing may be expected from the Lord; In him we are</P>
