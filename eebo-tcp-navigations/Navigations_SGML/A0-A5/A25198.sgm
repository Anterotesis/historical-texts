<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have adventured on your Lord&s;hips accep|tance by gue&s;s; if pre|&s;umption has led me into an Error that de&s;erves cor|rection, I heartily beg In|dempnity, and re&s;olve to repent &s;oundly for it, and do &s;o no more. VVhat I pre&s;ent I know to be true, <HI>Experientia docet</HI>; It being
<PB REF="4">
an infallible Maxim, <HI>That there is no Globe like the occu|lar and experimental view of a Countrey.</HI> And had not Fate by a nece&s;&s;ary imploy|ment, confin'd me within the narrow walks of a four years Servitude, and by de|grees led me through the mo&s;t intricate and dubious paths of this Countrey, by a commanding and unde|niable Enjoynment, I could not, nor &s;hould I ever have undertaken to have written a line of this nature.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">If I have wrote or com|po&s;ed any thing that's wilde and confu&s;ed, it is becau&s;e I am &s;o my &s;elf, and the world, as far as I can per|ceive, is not much out of the &s;ame trim; therefore I re&s;olve, if I am brought to the Bar of <HI>Common Law</HI> for any thing I have done here, to plead <HI>Non compos men|tis,</HI> to &s;ave my Bacon.</P>
<P>There is an old Saying in Engli&s;h, <HI>He mu&s;t ri&s;e betimes that would plea&s;e every one.</HI> And I am afraid I have lain
<PB REF="5">
&s;o long a bed, that I think I &s;hall plea&s;e no body; if it mu&s;t be &s;o, I cannot help it. But as <HI>Felton</HI> in his <HI>Re&s;olves</HI> &s;ays, <HI>In things that mu&s;t be, 'tis good to be re&s;olute</HI>; And therefore what De&s;tiny has ordained, I am re&s;olved to wink, and &s;tand to it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YO&V; are both Adventurers, the one of E&s;tate, the other of Life: I could tell you I am an Adventurer too, if I dur&s;t pre&s;ume to come into your Com|pany. I have ventured to come abroad in Print, and if I &s;hould be laughed at for my good mean|ing, it would &s;o break the credit of my &V;nder|&s;tanding, that I &s;hould never dare to &s;hew my face upon the Exchange of (conceited) Wits again.</P>
<P>This di&s;h of Di&s;cour&s;e was intended for you at fir&s;t, but it was manners to let my Lord have the fir&s;t cut, the Pye being his own. I be&s;eech you accept of the matter as 'tis dre&s;t, only to &s;tay your &s;tomachs, and I'le promi&s;e you the next &s;hall be better done. 'Tis all as I can &s;erve you in at pre&s;ent, and it may be que&s;tionable whether I have &s;erved you in this or no. Here I pre&s;ent you with <HI>A Character of Mary-Land,</HI> it may

I prote&s;t what I have writ is from an experimental knowledge of the Country, and not from any imaginary &s;uppo|&s;ition. If I am blamed for what I have done too much, it is the fir&s;t, and I will irrevocably pro|mi&s;e it &s;hall be the la&s;t. There's a Maxim upon Tryals at A&s;&s;izes, That if a Thief be taken upon the fir&s;t fault, if it be not too hainous, they only burn him in the hand and let him go: So I de|&s;ire you to do by me, if you find any thing that bears a criminal ab&s;urdity in it, only burn me for my fir&s;t fact and let me go. But I am affraid I have kept you too long in the Entry, I &s;hall de&s;ire you therefore to come in and &s;it down.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rea&s;on why I appear in this place is, le&s;t the general Reader &s;hould conclude I have nothing to &s;ay for my &s;elf; and truly he's in the right on't, for I have but little to &s;ay (for my &s;elf) at this time: For I have had &s;o large a Journey, and &s;o heavy a Burden to bring <HI>Mary-Land</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> that I am almo&s;t out of breath: I'le promi&s;e you after I am come to my &s;elf, you &s;hall hear more of me. Good Reader, becau&s;e you &s;ee me make a brief Apologetical excu&s;e for my &s;elf, don't judge me; for I am &s;o &s;elf-con|ceited of my own merits, that I almo&s;t think I want none. <HI>De Lege non judicandum ex

I &s;uppo&s;e by this time &s;ome of my &s;peculative ob&s;ervers have judged me vain|glorious; but if they did but rightly con&s;ider me, they would not be &s;o cen&s;orious. For I dwell &s;o far from Neighbors, that if I do not prai&s;e my &s;elf, no body el&s;e will: And &s;ince I am left alone, I am re&s;olved to &s;um|mon the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of Fowles to the Bar for my excu&s;e, and by their irrevocable Sta|tutes plead my di&s;charge, <HI>For its an ill Bird will befoule her own Ne&s;t:</HI> Be&s;ides, I have a thou&s;and <HI>Billings-gate</HI> Collegians that will give in their te&s;timony, <HI>That they never knew a Fi&s;h-woman cry &s;tinking Fi&s;h.</HI> Thus leaving the No&s;trils of the Citizens Wives to de|mon&s;trate what they plea&s;e as to that, and thee (Good Reader) to &s;ay what thou wilt, I bid thee Farewel.</P>

<P>As for the wilde Animals of this Country, which loo&s;ely inhabits the Woods in multitudes, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give you an exact de&s;cription of them all, eon&s;idering the multiplicity as well as the diver&s;ity of &s;o numerous an ex|tent of Creatures: But &s;uch as has fallen within the compa&s;s or pro&s;pect of my knowledge, tho&s;e you &s;hall know of; <HI>videlicet,</HI> the Deer, becau&s;e they are oftner &s;een, and more participated of by the Inhabitants of the Land, who&s;e acquaintance by a cu&s;tomary fa|miliarity becomes much more com|mon then the re&s;t of Bea&s;ts that inhabit the Woods, by u&s;ing them&s;elves in Herds about the Chri&s;tian Plantations.

that which is killed by the Chri&s;tian Inhabitant, that doth it more for recre|ation, then for the benefit they reap by it. I &s;ay, the fle&s;h of Veni&s;on becomes (as to food) rather denyed, then any way e&s;teemed or de&s;ired. And this I &s;peak from an experimental know|ledge; For when I was under a Com|mand, and debarr'd of a four years ranging Liberty in the Province of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> the Gentleman whom I &s;erved my conditional and prefixed time withall, had at one time in his hou&s;e four&s;core Veni&s;ons, be&s;ides plen|ty of other provi&s;ions to &s;erve his Fa|mily nine months, they being but &s;even in number; &s;o that before this Veni&s;on was brought to a period by eating, it &s;o nau&s;eated our appetites and &s;to|machs, that plain bread was rather courted and de&s;ired then it.</P>

<P>As for the Wolves, Bears, and Panthers of this Country, they inhabit commonly in great multitudes up in the remote&s;t parts of the Continent; yet at &s;ome certain time they come down near the Plantations, but do little hurt or injury worth noting, and that which they do is of &s;o degenerate and low a nature, (as in reference to the fiercene&s;s and heroick vigour that dwell in the &s;ame kind of Bea&s;ts in other Countries) that they are hardly worth mentioning: For the highe&s;t of their de&s;igns and circumventing reaches is but cowardly and ba&s;e, only to &s;teal a

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Government and natural di&s;po|&s;ition of the People.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MARY-LAND,</HI> not from the remotene&s;s of her &s;ituation, but from the regularity of her well-ordered Government, may (without &s;in, I think) be called <HI>Singular</HI>: And though &s;he is not &s;upported with &s;uch large Reve|nues as &s;ome of her Neighbours are, yet &s;uch is her wi&s;dom in a re&s;erved &s;ilence, and not in pomp, to &s;hew her well-conditioned E&s;tate, in relieving at a di&s;tance the proud poverty of tho&s;e that wont be &s;een they want, as well as tho&s;e which by undeniable nece&s;&s;ities are drove upon the Rocks of pinching wants: Yet &s;uch a loath&s;ome creature is a common and folding-handed Beg|ger, that upon the penalty of almo&s;t a perpetual&punc; working in Impri&s;onment, they are not to appear, nor lurk near our vigilant and laborious dwellings.
<PB N="16" REF="22">
The Country hath received a general &s;pleen and antipathy again&s;t the very name and nature of it; and though there were no Law provided (as there is) to &s;uppre&s;s it, I am certainly con|fident, there is none within the Pro|vince that would lower them&s;elves &s;o much below the dignity of men to beg, as long as limbs and life keep hou&s;e to|gether; &s;o much is a vigilant indu&s;trious care e&s;teem'd.</P>
<P>He that de&s;ires to &s;ee the real Plat|form of a quiet and &s;ober Government extant, Superiority with a meek and yet commanding power &s;itting at the Helme, &s;teering the actions of State quietly, through the multitude and di|ver&s;ity of Opinionous waves that di|ver&s;ly meet, let him look on <HI>Mary-Land</HI> with eyes admiring, and he'le then judge her, <HI>The Miracle of this Age.</HI></P>
<P>Here the <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Epi&s;copal,</HI> (whom the world would per&s;wade have proclaimed open Wars irrevocably again&s;t each other)
<PB N="17" REF="22">
contrarywi&s;e concur in an unanimous parallel of friend&s;hip, and in&s;eparable love intayled unto one another: All Inqui&s;itions, Martyrdom, and Bani&s;h|ments are not &s;o much as named, but unexpre&s;&s;ably abhorr'd by each other.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Opinions and Sects that lodge within this Government, meet not together in mutinous contempts to di&s;quiet the power that bears Rule, but with a reverend quietne&s;s obeys the legal commands of Authority. Here's never &s;een Five Monarchies in a Zealous Rebellion, oppo&s;ing the Rights and Liberties of a true &s;etled Government, or Monarchical Authority: Nor did I ever &s;ee (here in <HI>Mary-Land</HI>) any of tho&s;e dancing Adamitical Si&s;ters, that plead a primitive Innocency for their ba&s;e ob&s;cenity, and naked deportment; but I conceive if &s;ome of them were there at &s;ome certain time of the year, between the Months of <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> when the winds blow from the North-We&s;t quarter of the world,
<PB N="18" REF="23">
that it would both cool, and (I believe) convert the hotte&s;t of the&s;e Zealots from their burning and fierce&s;t Con|cupi&s;cence.</P>
<P>The Government of this Province doth continually, by all lawful means, &s;trive to purge her Dominions from &s;uch ba&s;e corroding humors, that would predominate upon the lea&s;t &s;mile of Liberty, did not the Laws check and bridle in tho&s;e unwarranted and tumul|tuous Opinions. And truly, where a Kingdom, State or Government, keeps or cuts down the weeds of de&s;tructive Opinions, there mu&s;t certainly be a ble&s;&s;ed Harmony of quietne&s;s. And I really believe this Land or Govern|ment of <HI>Mary-Land</HI> may boa&s;t, that &s;he enjoys as much quietne&s;s from the di&s;turbance of Rebellious Opinions, as mo&s;t States or Kingdoms do in the world: For here every man lives quiet|ly, and follows his labour and imploy|ment de&s;iredly; and by the protection of the Laws, they are &s;upported from
<PB N="19" REF="23">
tho&s;e mole&s;tious troubles that ever attend upon the Commons of other States and Kingdoms, as well as from the Aquafortial operation of great and eating Taxes. Here's nothing to be levyed out of the Granaries of Corn; but contrarywi&s;e, by a Law every Do|me&s;tick Governor of a Family is en|joyned to make or cau&s;e to be made &s;o much Corn by a ju&s;t limitation, as &s;hall be &s;ufficient for him and his Family: So that by this wi&s;e and <HI>Janus</HI>-like providence, the thin jawed Skeliton with his &s;tarv'd Carke&s;s is never &s;een walking the Woods of <HI>Mary-Land</HI> to affrighten Children.</P>
<P>Once every year within this Province is an A&s;&s;embly called, and out of every re&s;pective County (by the con&s;ent of the people) there is cho&s;en a number of men, and to them is deliver'd up the Grievances of the Country; and they maturely debate the matters, and accord<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ng to their Con&s;ciences make Laws for the general good of the peo|ple;
<PB N="20" REF="24">
and where any former Law that was made, &s;eems and is prejudicial to the good or quietne&s;s of the Land, it is repeal'd. The&s;e men that determine on the&s;e matters for the Republique, are called Burge&s;&s;es, and they com|monly fit in Junto about &s;ix weeks, being for the mo&s;t part good ordinary Hou&s;holders of the &s;everal Counties, which do more by a plain and hone&s;t Con&s;cience, then by artificial Syllo|gi&s;ms dre&s;t up in gilded Orations.</P>
<P>Here Suits and Tryals in Law &s;el|dome hold di&s;pute two Terms or Courts, but according as the Equity of the cau&s;e appears is brought to a period. The <HI>Temples</HI> and <HI>Grays-Inne</HI> are clear out of fa&s;hion here: <HI>Marriot</HI> would &s;ooner get a paunch-devouring meal for nothing, then for his invading Coun&s;il.

So contrary to the Genius of the people, if not to the quiet Government of the Province, that the turbulent Spirit of continued and vexatious Law, with all its querks and eva&s;ions, is openly and mo&s;t eagerly oppo&s;ed, that might make matters either dubious, tedious, or trou|ble&s;om. All other matters that would be ranging in contrary and improper Spheres, (in &s;hort) are here by the Power moderated, lower'd, and &s;ub|dued. All villanous Outrages that are committed in other States, are not &s;o much as known here: A man may walk in the open Woods as &s;ecure from being externally di&s;&s;ected, as in his own hou&s;e or dwelling. So hateful is a Robber, that if but once ima|gin'd to be &s;o, he's kept at a di&s;tance,

Here the Con&s;table hath no need of a train of Holberteers, that carry more Armour about them, then heart to guard him: Nor is he ever troubled to leave his Feathered Ne&s;t to &s;ome friend|ly &s;ucce&s;&s;or, while he is placing of his Lanthern-horn Guard at the end of &s;ome &s;u&s;picious Street, to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ch &s;ome Night-walker, or Batchelor of Leache|ry, that has taken his Degree three &s;tory high in a Bawdy-hou&s;e Here's no <HI>Newgates</HI> for pilfering Felons, nor <HI>Ludgates</HI> for Debtors, nor any <HI>Bride|w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ls</HI> to la&s;h the &s;oul of Concupi&s;cence

Common Ale-hou&s;es, (who&s;e dwellings are the only Receptacles of debauchery and ba&s;e|ne&s;s, and tho&s;e Schools that trains up Youth, as well as Age, to ruine) in this Province there are none; neither hath Youth his &s;wing or range in &s;uch a pro|fu&s;e and unbridled liberty as in other Countries; for from an an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ient Cu&s;tom at the primitive &s;eating of the place, the Son works as well as the Servant, (an excellent cure for untam'd Youth) &s;o that before they eat their bread, they are commonly taught how to earn it; which makes them by that time Age &s;peaks them capable of receiving that which their Parents indulgency is ready to give them, and which partly is by their own laborious indu&s;try purcha&s;ed, they manage it with &s;uch a &s;erious, grave

The Women differ &s;omething in this point, though not much: They are extreme ba&s;hful at the fir&s;t view, but after a continuance of time hath brought them acquainted, there they become di&s;creetly familiar, and are much more talkative then men.

<P>AS there can be no Monarchy with|out the Supremacy of a King and Crown, nor no King without Subjects, nor any Parents without it be by the fruitful off-&s;pring of Children; neither can there be any Ma&s;ters, unle&s;s it be by the inferior Servitude of tho&s;e that dwell under them, by a commanding enjoynment: And &s;ince it is ordained from the original and &s;uperabounding wi&s;dom of all things, That there &s;hould be Degrees and Diver&s;ities among&s;t the Sons of men, in acknowledging of a Superiority from Inferiors to Superi|ors; the Servant with a reverent and befitting Obedience is as liable to this duty in a mea&s;urable performance to him whom he &s;erves, as the loyale&s;t

<PB N="29" REF="28">
But (ble&s;&s;ed be God) tho&s;e Clouds are blown over, and the Government of the Kingdom coucht under a more &s;table form.</P>
<P>There is no truer Emblem of Con|fu&s;ion either in Monarchy or Dome|&s;tick Governments, then when either the Subject, or the Servant, &s;trives for the upper hand of his Prince, or Ma&s;ter, and to be equal with him, from whom he receives his pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: Why then, if Servitude be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that no place can be governed in order, nor people live without it, this may &s;erve to tell tho&s;e which prick up their ears and bray again&s;t it, That they are none but A&s;&s;es, and de&s;erve the Bridle of a &s;trict commanding power to reine them in: For I'me certainly confi|dent, that there are &s;everal Thou|&s;ands in mo&s;t Kingdoms of Chri&s;ten|dom, that could not at all live and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s they had &s;erved &s;ome prefixed time, to learn either &s;ome Trade, Art, or Science, and by either
<PB N="30" REF="29">
of them to extract their pre&s;ent live|lihood.</P>
<P>Then methinks this may &s;top the mouths of tho&s;e that will undi&s;creetly compa&s;&s;ionate them that dwell under nece&s;&s;ary Servitudes; for let but Pa|rents of an indifferent capacity in E|&s;tates, when their Childrens age by computation &s;peak them &s;eventeen or eighteen years old, turn them loo&s;e to the wide world, without a &s;even years working Apprentice&s;hip, (being ju&s;t brought up to the bare formality of a little reading and writing) and you &s;hall immediately &s;ee how weak and &s;hiftle&s;s they'le be towards the main|taining and &s;upporting of them&s;elves; and (without either &s;tealing or beg|ging) their bodies like a Sentinel mu&s;t continually wait to &s;ee when their Souls will be frighted away by the pale Gho&s;t of a &s;tarving want.</P>
<P>Then let &s;uch, where Providence hath ordained to live as Servants, either in <HI>England</HI> or beyond Sea, endure the
<PB N="31" REF="29">
prefixed yoak of their limited time with patience, and then in a &s;mall computa|tion of years, by an indu&s;trious endea|vour, they may become Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Families them&s;elves. And let this be &s;poke to the de&s;erved prai&s;e of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> That the four years I &s;erved there were not to me &s;o &s;lavi&s;h, as a two years Servitude of a Handi|craft Apprentice&s;hip was here in <HI>Lon|don; Volenti enim nil difficile</HI>: Not that I write this to &s;educe or delude any, or to draw them from their native &s;oyle, but out of a love to my Country|men, whom in the general I wi&s;h well to, and that the lowe&s;t of them may live in &s;uch a capacity of E&s;tate, as that the bare intere&s;t of their Livelihoods might not altogether depend upon per&s;ons of the greate&s;t extendments.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e who&s;e abilities here in <HI>England</HI> are capable of maintaining them&s;elves in any rea&s;onable and hand|&s;om manner, they had be&s;t &s;o to re|main, le&s;t the roughne&s;s of the Ocean,

together with the &s;taring vi&s;ages of the wilde Animals, which they may &s;ee after their arrival into the Country, may alter the natural di&s;po&s;itions of their bodies, that the &s;tay'd and &s;olid part that kept its motion by Doctor <HI>Trigs</HI> purgationary operation, may run beyond the byas of the wheel in a vio|lent and laxative confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now contrarywi&s;e, they who are low, and make bare &s;hifts to buoy them&s;elves up above the &s;habby center of beggarly and incident ca&s;ualties, I heartily could wi&s;h the removal of &s;ome of them into <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> which would make much better for them that &s;tay'd behind, as well as it would advantage tho&s;e that went.</P>
<P>They who&s;e abilities cannot extend to purcha&s;e their own tran&s;portation over into <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> (and &s;urely he that cannot command &s;o &s;mall a &s;um for &s;o great a matter, his life mu&s;t needs be mighty low and dejected) I &s;ay they may for the debarment of a four

years &s;ordid liberty, go over into this Province and there live plentiou&s;ly well. And what's a four years Servitude to advantage a man all the remainder of his dayes, making his predece&s;&s;ors hap|py in his &s;ufficient abilities, which he at|tained to partly by the re&s;trainment of &s;o &s;mall a time?</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e that commit them&s;elves unto the care of the Merchant to carry them over, they need not trouble them|&s;elves with any inqui&s;itive &s;earch touch|ing their Voyage; for there is &s;uch an hone&s;t care and provi&s;ion made for them all the time they remain aboard the Ship, and are &s;ailing over, that they want for nothing that is nece&s;&s;ary and convenient.</P>
<P>The Merchant commonly before they go aboard the Ship, or &s;et them|&s;elves in any forwardne&s;s for their Voy|age, has Conditions of Agreements drawn between him and tho&s;e that by a voluntary con&s;ent become his Servants, to &s;erve him, his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns, ac|cording
<PB N="34" REF="31">
as they in their primitive ac|quaintance have made their bargain, &s;ome two, &s;ome three, &s;ome four years; and whatever the Ma&s;ter or Servant tyes him&s;elf up to here in <HI>England</HI> by Condition, the Laws of the Province will force a performance of when they come there: Yet here is this Priviledge in it when they arrive, If they dwell not with the Merchant they made their fir&s;t agreement withall, they may choo&s;e whom they will &s;erve their prefixed time with; and after their curio&s;ity has pitcht on one whom they think fit for their turn, and that they may live well withall, the Merchant makes an A&s;&s;ign|ment of the Indenture over to him whom they of their free will have cho|&s;en to be their Ma&s;ter, in the &s;ame na|ture as we here in <HI>England</HI> (and no otherwi&s;e) turn over Covenant Ser|vants or Apprentices from one Ma&s;ter to another. Then let tho&s;e who&s;e chaps are alwayes breathing forth tho&s;e filthy dregs of abu&s;ive exclamations,

which are Lymbeckt from their &s;otti&s;h and prepo&s;terous brains, again&s;t this Country of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> &s;aying, That tho&s;e which are tran&s;ported over thither, are &s;old in open Market for Slaves, and draw in Carts like Hor&s;es; which is &s;o damnable an untruth, that if they &s;hould &s;earch to the very Center of Hell, and enquire for a Lye of the mo&s;t antient and damned &s;tamp, I confident|ly believe they could not find one to parallel this: For know, That the Ser|vants here in <HI>Mary-Land</HI> of all Colo|nies, di&s;tant or remote Plantations, have the lea&s;t cau&s;e to complain, either for &s;trictne&s;s of Servitude, want of Provi|&s;ions, or need of Apparel: Five dayes and a half in the Summer weeks is the alotted time that they work in; and for two months, when the Sun predominates in the highe&s;t pitch of his heat, they claim an antient and cu&s;tomary Priviledge, to repo&s;e them|&s;elves three hours in the day with|in the hou&s;e, and this is undenia|bly

granted to them that work in the Fields.</P>
<P>In the Winter time, which la&s;teth three months, (<HI>viz.) December, Ja|nuary,</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> they do little or no work or imployment, &s;ave cutting of wood to make good fires to &s;it by, unle&s;s their Ingenuity will prompt them to hunt the Deer, or Bear, or recreate them&s;elves in Fowling, to &s;laughter the Swans, Gee&s;e, and Turkeys, (which this Country affords in a mo&s;t plentiful manner:) For every Servant has a Gun, Powder and Shot allowed him, to &s;port him withall on all Holidayes and lea&s;u|rable times, if he be capable of u&s;ing it, or be willing to learn.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e Servants which come over into this Province, being Artifi|cers, they never (during their Servi|tude) work in the Fields, or do any other imployment &s;ave that which their Handicraft and Mechanick endeavors are capable of putting them upon, and are e&s;teem'd as well by their Ma&s;ters,
<PB N="37" REF="32">
as tho&s;e that imploy them, above mea|&s;ure. He that's a Trade&s;man here in <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> (though a Servant) lives as well as mo&s;t common Handicrafts do in <HI>London,</HI> though they may want &s;omething of that Liberty which Free|men have, to go and come at their plea|&s;ure; yet if it were rightly under&s;tood and con&s;idered, what mo&s;t of the Li|berties of the &s;everal poor Trade&s;men are taken up about, and what a care and trouble attends that thing they call Li|berty, which according to the common tran&s;lation is but Idlene&s;s, and (if weighed in the Ballance of a ju&s;t Rea|&s;on) will be found to be much heavier and cloggy then the four years re&s;train|ment of a <HI>Mary-Land</HI> Servitude. He that lives in the nature of a Servant in this Province, mu&s;t &s;erve but four years by the Cu&s;tom of the Country; and when the expiration of his time &s;peaks him a Freeman, there's a Law in the Province, that enjoyns his Ma&s;ter whom he hath &s;erved to give him Fifty Acres
<PB N="38" REF="33">
of Land, Corn to &s;erve him a whole year, three Sutes of Apparel, with things nece&s;&s;ary to them, and Tools to work withall; &s;o that they are no &s;ooner free, but they are ready to &s;et up for them&s;elves, and when once entred, they live pa&s;&s;ingly well.</P>
<P>The Women that go over into this Province as Servants, have the be&s;t luck here as in any place of the world be&s;ides; for they are no &s;ooner on &s;hoar, but they are courted into a Co|pulative Matrimony, which &s;ome of them (for ought I know) had they not come to &s;uch a Market with their Virginity, might have kept it by them untill it had been mouldy, unle&s;s they had let it out by a yearly rent to &s;ome of the Inhabitants of <HI>Lewknors-lane,</HI> or made a Deed of Gift of it to Mother <HI>Coney,</HI> having only a poor &s;tipend out of it, untill the Gallows or Ho&s;pital cal|led them away.

they be good Rhetoricians, and well vers'd in the Art of per&s;wa&s;ion, then (probably) they may ryvet them&s;elves in the time of their Servitude into the private and re&s;erved favour of their Mi|&s;tre&s;s, if Age &s;peak their Ma&s;ter defi|cient.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, touching the Servants of this Province, they live well in the time of their Service, and by their re&s;train|ment in that time, they are made capa|ble of living much better when they come to be free; which in &s;everal other parts of the world I have ob&s;erved, That after &s;ome Servants have brought their indented and limited time to a ju&s;t and legal period by Servitude, they have been much more incapable of &s;up|porting them&s;elves from &s;inking into the Gulf of a &s;lavi&s;h, poor, fettered, and intangled life, then all the fa&s;tne&s;s of their prefixed time did involve them in before.</P>
<P>Now the main and principal Rea&s;on of tho&s;e incident ca&s;ualties, that wait
<PB N="40" REF="34">
continually upon the re&s;idencies of mo&s;t poor Artificers, is (I gather) from the multiplicity or innumerablene&s;s of tho&s;e &s;everal Companies of Trade&s;men, that dwell &s;o clo&s;ely and &s;tiflingly to|gether in one and the &s;ame place, that like the chafing Gum in Watered-Tabby, they eat into the folds of one anothers E&s;tates. And this might ea&s;i|ly be remedied, would but &s;ome of them remove and di&s;per&s;e di&s;tantly where want and nece&s;&s;ity calls for them; their dwellings (I am confident) would be much larger, and their conditions much better, as well in reference to their E&s;tates, as to the &s;atisfactorine&s;s of their minds; having a continual im|ployment, and from that imployment a continual benefit, without either beg|ging, &s;educing, or flat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ering for it, en|croaching that one month from one of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, that they are hea|ved out them&s;elves the next. For I have ob&s;erved on the other &s;ide of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> that the whole cour&s;e of
<PB N="41" REF="34">
mo&s;t Mechanical endeavors, is to catch, &s;natch, and undervalue one another, to get a little work, or a Cu&s;tomer; which when they have attained by their low-built and &s;neaking circumventings, it &s;tands upon &s;o fla&s;hy, mutable, and tran&s;itory a foundation, that the be&s;t of his hopes is commonly extingui&s;ht before the poor undervalued Trade&s;|man is warm in the enjoyment of his Cu&s;tomer.</P>
<P>Then did not a cloud of low and ba&s;e Cowardize eclip&s;e the Spirits of the&s;e men, the&s;e things might ea&s;ily be diverted; but they had as live take a Bear by the tooth, as think of leaving their own Country, though they live among their own National people, and are governed by the &s;ame Laws they have here, yet all this wont do with them; and all the Rea&s;on they can render to the contrary is, There's a great Sea betwixt them and <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> and in that Sea there are Fi&s;hes, and not only Fi&s;hes but great Fi&s;hes, and then

<P>TRafique, Commerce, and Trade, are tho&s;e great wheeles that by their circular and continued motion, turn into mo&s;t Kingdoms of the Earth
<PB N="46" REF="37">
the plenty of abundant Riches that they are commonly fed withall: For Tra|fique in his right de&s;cription, is the very Soul of a Kingdom; and &s;hould but Fate ordain a removal of it for &s;ome years, from the riche&s;t and mo&s;t popu|lous Monarchy that dwells in the mo&s;t fertile clyme of the whole Univer&s;e, he would &s;oon find by a woful experiment, the mi&s;s and lo&s;s of &s;o reviving a &s;up|porter. And I am certainly confident, that <HI>England</HI> would as &s;oon feel her feeblene&s;s by withdrawment of &s;o great an upholder; as well in reference to the internal and healthful pre&s;ervative of her Inhabitants, for want of tho&s;e Medici|nal Drugs that are landed upon her Coa&s;t every year, as the external pro|fits, Glory and beneficial Graces that accrue by her.</P>
<P><HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> might knock down his Forge, if Trafique and Commerce &s;hould once cea&s;e, and grynde the hilt of his Sword into Powder, and take &s;ome of the Infu&s;ion to make him &s;o

<P>Silks and Cambricks, and Lawns to make &s;leeves, would be as &s;oon mi&s;s'd at Court, as Gold and Silver would be in the Mint and Pockets: The Low-Country Soldier would be at a cold &s;tand for Outlandi&s;h Furrs to make him Muffs, to keep his ten &s;imilitudes warm in the Winter, as well as the Furrier for want of Skins to uphold his Trade.</P>

<P>The three main Commodities this Country affords for Trafique, are To|bacco, Furrs, and Fle&s;h. Furrs and Skins, as Beavers, Otters, Musk-Rats, Rackoons, Wild-Cats, and Elke or Buffeloe, with divers others, which

were fir&s;t made vendible by the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Country, and &s;old to the Inha|bitant, and by them to the Merchant, and &s;o tran&s;ported into <HI>England</HI> and other places where it becomes mo&s;t commodious.</P>
<P>Tobacco is the only &s;olid Staple Commodity of this Province: The u&s;e of it was fir&s;t found out by the <HI>Indians</HI> many Ages agoe, and tran&s;|ferr'd into Chri&s;tendom by that great Di&s;coverer of <HI>America Columbus</HI>: It's generally made by all the Inhabi|tants of this Province, and between the months of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> they &s;ow the &s;eed, (which is much &s;maller then Mu&s;tard-&s;eed) in &s;mall beds and pat|ches digg'd up and made &s;o by art, and about <HI>May</HI> the Plants commonly appear green in tho&s;e beds: In <HI>June</HI> they are tran&s;planted from their beds, and &s;et in little hillocks in di&s;tant rowes, dug up for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; &s;ome twice or thrice they are weeded, and &s;uccour|ed from their illegitimate Leaves that
<PB N="51" REF="39">
would be peeping out from the body of the Stalk. They top the &s;everal Plants as they find occa&s;ion in their predominating rankne&s;s: About the middle of <HI>September</HI> they cut the To|bacco down, and carry it into hou&s;es, (made for that purpo&s;e) to bring it to its purity: And after it has attained by a convenient attendance upon time, to its perfection, it is then tyed up in bundles, and packt into Hogs-heads, and then laid by for the Trade.</P>
<P>Between <HI>November</HI> and <HI>January</HI> there arrives in this Province Shipping to the number of twenty &s;ail and up|wards, all Merchant-men loaden with Commodities to Trafique and di&s;po&s;e of, trucking with the Planter for Silks, Hollands, Serges, and Broad-clothes, with other nece&s;&s;ary Goods, priz'd at &s;uch and &s;uch rates as &s;hall be judg'd on is fair and legal, for Tobacco at &s;o much the pound, and advantage on both &s;ides con&s;idered; the Planter for his work, and the Merchant for adven|turing

Tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that I have convers'd withall here in this Province of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> and have had any oc|cular experimental view of either of their Cu&s;toms, Manners, Religions, and Ab&s;urdities, are called by the name of <HI>Su&s;quehanocks,</HI> being a people lookt upon by the Chri&s;tian Inhabitants, as the mo&s;t Noble and Heroick Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> that dwell upon the confines of <HI>America</HI>; al&s;o are &s;o allowed and

<P>Their bodies are cloth'd with no other Armour to defend them from the nipping fro&s;ts of a benumbing Win|ter, or the penetrating and &s;corching influence of the Sun in a hot Summer, then what Nature gave them when they parted with the dark receptacle of their Mothers womb.

in&s;tinct to be re&s;ervedly mode&s;t, there they become cover'd. The formality of <HI>Jezabels</HI> artificial Glory is much courted and followed by the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> only in matter of colours (I conceive) they differ. The <HI>Indians</HI> paint upon their faces one &s;troke of red, another of green, another of white, and another of black, &s;o that when they have accom|pli&s;hed the Equipage of their Counte|nance in this trim, they are the only Hieroglyphicks and Repre&s;entatives of the Furies. Their skins are naturally white, but altered from their originals by the &s;everal dyings of Roots and Barks, that they prepare and make u&s;e|ful to metamorphize their hydes into a dark Cinamon brown. The hair of their head is black, long and har&s;h, but where Nature hath appointed the &s;itua|tion of it any where el&s;e, they divert it (by an antient cu&s;tom) from its growth, by pulling it up hair by hair by the root in its primitive appearance. Several of them wear divers impre&s;&s;ions

on their brea&s;ts and armes, as the picture of the Devil, Bears, Tigers, and Panthers, which are imprinted on their &s;everal lineaments with much diffi|culty and pain, with an irrevocable de|termination of its abiding there: And this they count a badge of Heroick Va|lour, and the only Ornament due to their <HI>Heroes.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Su&s;quehanock Indians</HI> are for the mo&s;t part great Warriours, and &s;el|dom &s;leep one Summer in the quiet armes of a peaceable Re&s;t, but keep (by their pre&s;ent Power, as well as by their former Conque&s;t) the &s;eve|ral Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> round about them, in a forceable obedience and &s;ub|jection.</P>

<P>The Warlike Equipage they put them&s;elves in when they prepare for <HI>Belona</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s March, is with their faces, armes, and brea&s;ts confu&s;edly painted, their hair greazed with Bears oyl, and &s;tuck thick with Swans Feathers, with a wreath or Diadem of black and white Beads upon their heads, a &s;mall Hatchet, in&s;tead of a Cymetre, &s;tuck in their girts behind them, and either with Guns, or Bows and Arrows. In this po&s;ture and dre&s;s they march out from their Fort, or dwelling, to the number of Forty in a Troop, &s;inging (or rather howling out) the Decades or Warlike exploits of their Ance&s;tors, ranging the wide Woods untill their fury has met with an Enemy worthy of their Re|venge. What Pri&s;oners fall into their hands by the de&s;tiny of War, they treat them very civilly while they re|main with them abroad, but when they
<PB N="63" REF="45">
once return homewards, they then begin to dre&s;s them in the habit for death, putting on their heads and armes wreaths of Beads, greazing their hair with fat, &s;ome going before, and the re&s;t behind, at equal di&s;tance from their Pri&s;oners, bellowing in a &s;trange and confu&s;ed manner, which is a true pre&s;age and fore-runner of de|&s;truction to their then conquered Enemy.</P>
<P>In this manner of march they con|tinue till they have brought them to their Barken City, where they deliver them up to tho&s;e that in cruelty will execute them, without either the legal Judgement of a Council of War, or the benefit of their Clergy at the Common Law. The common and u&s;ual deaths they put their Pri&s;oners to, is to bind them to &s;takes, making a fire &s;ome di&s;tance from them; then one or other of them, who&s;e Genius delights in the art of Pagani&s;h di&s;&s;ecti|on, with a &s;harp knife or flint cuts

While they are thus acting this cruelty on their heads, &s;e|veral others are preparing pieces of Iron, and barrels of old Guns, which they make red hot, to &s;ear each part and lineament of their bodies, which they perform and act in a mo&s;t cruel and barbarous manner: And while they are thus in the mid&s;t of their tor|ments and execrable u&s;age, &s;ome tear|ing their skin and hair of their head off by violence, others &s;earing their bodies with hot irons, &s;ome are cutting their
<PB N="65" REF="46">
fle&s;h off, and eating it before their eyes raw while they are alive; yet all this and much more never makes them lower the Top-gallant &s;ail of their Heroick courage, to beg with a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive Repentance any indulgent fa|vour from their per&s;ecuting Enemies; but with an undaunted contempt to their cruelty, eye it with &s;o &s;light and mean a re&s;pect, as if it were below them to value what they did, they couragi|ou&s;ly (while breath doth libertize them) &s;ing the &s;ummary of their Warlike Atchievements.</P>
<P>Now after this cruelty has brought their tormented lives to a period, they immediately fall to butchering of them into parts, di&s;tributing the &s;everal pieces among&s;t the Sons of War, to in-tomb the ruines of their decea&s;ed Con|que&s;t in no other Sepulchre then their un&s;anctified maws; which they with more appetite and de&s;ire do eat and dige&s;t, then if the be&s;t of foods &s;hould court their &s;tomachs to participate of
<PB N="66" REF="47">
the mo&s;t re&s;torative Banquet. Yet though they now and then feed upon the Carke&s;&s;es of their Enemies, this is not a common dyet, but only a parti|cular di&s;h for the better &s;ort; for there is not a Bea&s;t that runs in the Woods of <HI>America,</HI> but if they can by any means come at him, without any &s;cru|ple of Con&s;cience they'le fall too (with|out &s;aying Grace) with a devouring greedine&s;s.</P>
<P>As for their Religion, together with their Rites and Ceremonies, they are &s;o ab&s;urd and ridiculous, that its al|mo&s;t a &s;in to name them They own no other Deity then the Devil, (&s;olid or profound) but with a kind of a wilde imaginary conjecture, they &s;up|po&s;e from their groundle&s;s conceits, that the World had a Maker, but where he is that made it, or whether he be living to this day, they know not. The Devil, as I &s;aid before, is all the God they own or wor&s;hip; and that more out of a &s;lavi&s;h fear, then

<P>Once in four years they Sacrifice a Childe to him, in an acknowledgement of their firm obedience to all his De|villi&s;h powers, and Helli&s;h commands. The Prie&s;ts to whom they apply them|&s;elves in matters of importance and greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, are like tho&s;e that at|tended upon the Oracle at <HI>Delphos,</HI> who by their Magick-&s;pells could com|mand a <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con</HI> from the Devil when they pleas'd.

<P>About <HI>November</HI> the be&s;t Hunters draw off to &s;everal remote places of the Woods, where they know the Deer, Bear, and Elke u&s;eth; there they build them &s;everal Cottages, which they call their Winter-quarter, where they remain for the &s;pace of three months, untill they have killed up a &s;ufficiency of Provi&s;ions to &s;upply their Families with in the Summer.</P>
<P>The Women are the Butchers, Cooks, and Tillers of the ground, the Men think it below the honour of a Ma&s;culine, to &s;toop to any thing but that which their Gun, or Bow and Arrows can command. The Men kill the &s;everal Bea&s;ts which they meet withall in the Woods, and the Women are the Pack hor&s;es to fetch it in upon their backs, fleying and dre&s;&s;ing the hydes, (as well as the fle&s;h for provi|&s;ion) to make them fit for Trading, and which are brought down to the

<P>I never ob&s;erved all the while I was among&s;t the&s;e naked <HI>Indians,</HI> that ever the Women wore the Breeches, or dared either in look or action predomi|nate over the Men.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis is the entrance upon my fifth year, and I fear 'twill prove the wor&s;t: I have been very much troubled with a throng of unruly Di&s;tempers, that have (contrary to my expectation) crouded into the Main-guard of my body, when the drow&s;ie Sentinels of my brain were a &s;leep. Where they got in I know not, but to my grief and ter|ror I find them predominant: Yet as Doctor <HI>Dunne,</HI> &s;ometimes Dean of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>That the bodies di&s;ea&s;es do but mellow a man for Heaven, and &s;o ferments him in this World, as he &s;hall need no long concoction in the Grave, but ha&s;ten to the Re&s;urrection.</HI> And if this were weighed &s;eriou&s;ly in the Bal|ance of Religious Rea&s;on, the World
<PB N="114" REF="71">
we dwell in would not &s;eem &s;o inticing and bewitching as it doth.</P>
<P>We are only &s;ent by God of an Errand into this World, and the time that's allotted us for to &s;tay, is only for an An&s;wer. When God my great Ma&s;ter &s;hall in good earne&s;t call me home, which the&s;e warnings tell me I have not long to &s;tay, I hope then I &s;hall be able to give him a good account of my Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> My weakne&s;s gives a &s;top to my writing, my hand being &s;o &s;hakingly feeble, that I can hardly hold my pen any further then to tell you, I am yours while I live, which I believe will be but &s;ome few minutes.</P>

<P>My good Parents, God hath done marvellous things for me, far beyond my de&s;erts, which at be&s;t were prepo|&s;terou&s;ly &s;inful, and un&s;uitable to the &s;acred will of an Almighty: <HI>But he is merciful, and his mercy endures for ever.</HI> When &s;inful man has by his Evils and Iniquities pull'd &s;ome pene|trating Judgement upon his head, and finding him&s;elf immediately not able to &s;tand under &s;o great a burthen as Gods &s;malle&s;t &s;troke of Ju&s;tice, lowers the Top-gallant &s;ayle of his Pride, and with
