&s;o far as to lay a plea&s;ing Violence upon me, in the&s;e mo&s;t pathetical and affectionate Terms: <HI>I was taking a re|view of a Troop of Hor&s;e, when your Let|ter was deliver'd to me, but having per|ceiv'd your Hand, which I very much e&s;teem, I cou'd not forbear opening it, &amp;c.</HI> Are not the&s;e &s;o many &s;ecret Charms that &s;uper&s;ede my Temerity, and which in&s;pire me with Zeal to yield a ready Obedience to all your Injunctions? I am unwilling to call to mind; that there is nothing more difficult than to give Satisfaction to &s;o di&s;cerning a Judgment as that of your Highne&s;s, that is to &s;ay, the Judgment of &s;o noble and &s;agacious a Per&s;on, which has alrea|dy penetrated into the inmo&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of Humane Literature, and has been form'd under the Tuition of the Learn|ed Mon&s;ieu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">offel.</HI> What a copious Theme lies before me! What a natural Propen&s;ity I have in directing my Di&s;|cour&s;e to you (my Lord) to &s;peak of nothing but your Highne&s;s! But I have a greater Veneration for &s;o noble a Sub|ject,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
which requires Talents and Ex|pre&s;&s;ions commen&s;urate to its Gran|deur, than to attempt &s;uch an Under|taking at all adventures. I mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity forget your Highne&s;s for a Mo|ment, to call to mind that 'tis my Du|ty to obey your Orders.</P>
<P>From <HI>Niew&s;tadt,</HI> where your High|ne&s;s was pleas'd to load me with all manner of Favours, I &s;et forward to <HI>Vienna,</HI> the di&s;tance to which is great; the cour&s;e of the <HI>Danube</HI> making ninety <HI>German</HI> Leagues within the &s;pace of five days. It is very delight|ful to imbark on this River, where a Man may &s;ail a great way without &s;eeming to &s;tir; and may change Countries and Provinces without any apparent change of Places; in &s;hort, he may there find means to perform as he Travels, what&s;oever can be done by him at home.</P>
<DIV2 N="Vienna" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VIENNA,</HEAD>
<P>Is the Capital City of <HI>Germany,</HI> or rather of the whole We&s;tern Conti|nent,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
for there at pre&s;ent is to be &s;een the Maje&s;ty of the Empire, as former|ly at <HI>Rome,</HI> which can be no longer &s;aid to be the Metropolis of the World, &s;ince the other is now become the u&s;u|al place of Re&s;idence of the Emperors. It may be e&s;teem'd &s;trong, not only by rea&s;on that it is defended with Ba&s;ti|ons and regular Out-works; but al&s;o becau&s;e <HI>Solyman</HI> &s;irnam'd the Magnifi|cent once be&s;ieg'd, but was not able to take it. For this <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> was not accu&s;tom'd to be foil'd, nei|ther indeed was he ever overcome; the &s;ame <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperor, among his Titles, a&s;&s;um'd the Style, <HI>of doing what&s;oever he thought fit, and of doing nothing that he di&s;lik'd.</HI> Your High|ne&s;s has in your Repo&s;itory &s;ome nota|ble Monuments of this famous Siege in certain Gold and Silver Medals, with this In&s;cription, <HI>T&V;RK BLEGERT WIEN,</HI> 1529.</P>
<P>This City is large within its &s;mall compa&s;s. May your Highne&s;s not be &s;urpris'd at this manner of Expre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
I mean, that within the &s;mall extent of Ground in which it is enclos'd upon account of its Fortifications, it is ex|tremely Populous, extremely Rich, and very well &s;upply'd with all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the convenience of Humane Life: I might al&s;o add, that this City has little wa&s;t Ground in it, and is not irregularly built; that the large&s;t Ci|ties of <HI>Europe</HI> have a greater quantity of wa&s;t Ground, or are more irregu|lar than this.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Mu&s;aeum</HI>'s or Repo&s;itories which I &s;aw there, are none of its lea&s;t Ornaments; one of the&s;e was brought from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and owes its original to the Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who furni&s;h'd it with a va&s;t number of Curio&s;ities at an incredible Expence: The other is a Patrimony of the Imperial Family, and a Collection made (as they &s;ay) by four Emperors: In the former are con|tain'd fifteen hundred Paintings drawn by the mo&s;t able Ma&s;ters of that Art; among which I have ob&s;erved &s;ome of <HI>Raphael, D' &V;rbin, Titian, Caraccio,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Paul Verone&s;e, Corregio, Palma, Holbein, Georgeon, Schiavone, Ba&s;&s;ano, Albert Du|rer, Rubens, Van Dyck, &amp;c.</HI> There are al&s;o engrav'd Prints of the be&s;t Pieces of this Ine&s;timable Collection; indeed the Project was well contriv'd, and the Reputation of <HI>Tenieres,</HI> who is the Graver, wou'd have been much more con&s;iderable, if he had taken care to put his de&s;ign in Execution with great|er &s;ucce&s;s: But the&s;e &s;orry Copies &s;erve only to di&s;gui&s;e the Originals, and to disfigure the fine&s;t Draughts in the World; &s;o that the defects of the Ar|ti&s;t, and not the excellency of tho&s;e admirable Ma&s;ter-pieces are apparent. There are in the &s;ame Repo&s;itory al|mo&s;t three hundred ancient Statues of Marble and Bra&s;s, be&s;ides a Collecti|on of eight hundred Golden Medals, all different, and more remarkable for their Rarity, and the de&s;ign of the Hi&s;tory, than for the value of the Mat|ter of which they are made. This va&s;t Collection of <HI>Greek</HI> Con&s;ular and Im|perial Medals, and others of large and
<PB N="7" REF="7">
middle-&s;iz'd Copper, cou'd not be ga|thered together, but by the hand of a Prince as Potent and Judicious as he that left it. I have an exact Catalogue of 'em, and your Highne&s;s will be &s;ur|pris'd to ob&s;erve &s;o many Rarities therein. I mu&s;t not omit by any means one Article, of which a Per&s;on as curi|ous as your Highne&s;s, ought to be in|form'd: It is one of the fine&s;t Di&s;co|veries that has been hitherto made to give light to the&s;e fir&s;t ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>France,</HI> and power|fully to e&s;tabli&s;h the Antiquity of that Monarchy, of which perhaps your Highne&s;s is not &s;o well per&s;waded, as of its Strength and Riches. About fifteen years ago in digging the Earth near <HI>Tournay,</HI> a Tomb was found, or rather the Remains of a Monument. It was that of <HI>Childeric</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and Father of <HI>Clouis</HI> the Great; The Bones of an Hor&s;e with pieces of Har|ne&s;s lay by him; and 'tis well known that in tho&s;e times Princes were wont to allow a place in their Burial to that
<PB N="8" REF="8">
of their Hor&s;es, on which they rode upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions. There was nothing wanting of all that the Pagan Religion con&s;ecrated to the Ho|nour and Memory of decea&s;ed Per|&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sword, the Baganet, the Ma&s;s of Arms, and a &s;mall In&s;trument to write according to the Cu&s;tom of that Age, with a great number of Gold Medals of the Emperors <HI>Leo</HI> and <HI>Zeno:</HI> But that which I take to be the great|e&s;t Rarity, was a certain number of Golden Bees longer than one's Thumb, and the Ring which this Prince was wont to u&s;e as a Seal or Signet. This is to meet with Truth in its Sanctua|ry, where it is inviolable, and thus the Dead them&s;elves afford a much better Illu&s;tration of their Hi&s;tory to the Living: But it was requi&s;ite that this Trea&s;ure &s;hould be di&s;cover'd un|der the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Prince, that ever cou'd Reign, I mean, the &s;ame Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who then govern'd the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
who was not ignorant of its Impor|tance, expre&s;s'd his de&s;ire of getting it in his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: I have been told at <HI>Vienna,</HI> that the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> was very &s;ollicitous to obtain it for the King, and that the Emperor cho&s;e rather to make the Pre&s;ent him&s;elf, be|fore this Elector had taken mea&s;ures to &s;ue for it: Thus the value of a Pre|&s;ent is much augmented, when it is &s;o frankly made. The Keeper of the Repo&s;itory gave me a &s;ight thereof, and was de&s;irous to know my Sentiments concerning it. I met with no great difficulty in di&s;covering the Truth, and &s;oon told him, that that which he &s;hew'd me, was only a Copy of the Original, which was kept in <HI>France</HI> in the Royal Repo&s;itory; all the Pieces of which I had formerly examin'd. The In&s;cription &s;eem'd to me to be well compos'd, and ends (as I take it) with the&s;e words; <HI>Di&s;cas Lector, vel &s;epul|tam Maje&s;tatem nu&s;quam interire.</HI> Some time after, his Imperial Maje&s;ty did me the honour to demand my opinion on the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">The other Repo&s;itory is &s;o full and &s;o rich, that it wou'd be difficult to add any thing that is new, either in re&s;pect to the quantity or rarity of the Commodities contain'd therein: It may be &s;oon perceiv'd that it is the Store-hou&s;e of many Emperors, and that it was not po&s;&s;ible for any, but the&s;e Ma&s;ters of the World, who may be &s;aid to be in a manner Omnipotent, to make &s;o noble a Collection of the mo&s;t precious Things of the whole U|niver&s;e; &s;o that one may well affirm with re&s;pect to this Trea&s;ure, what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> wrote in his <HI>Jewi&s;h Antiquities</HI> concerning the Triumph of <HI>Titus</HI> after the Conque&s;t of <HI>Judaea, viz.</HI> That even tho&s;e Eyes that were accu&s;tom'd to Miracles were dazl'd with it. It wou'd be a Tre&s;pa&s;s upon your High|ne&s;s's Patience, to give a particular ac|count of every one of the&s;e Curio&s;ities in an endle&s;s Di&s;cour&s;e; and you may vouch&s;afe to remember, that my pre|&s;ent de&s;ign is only to furni&s;h matter for a &s;imple Conference, in which I am
<PB N="11" REF="9">
unwilling to tire the Reader with a Volume; therefore I &s;hall only ju&s;t mention that which has had the great|e&s;t Influence upon my Imagination.</P>
<P>Two thou&s;and two hundred Silver Medals of the Empre&s;s <HI>Sabina,</HI> with the &s;ame Rever&s;e, VENERI GENE|TRICI, all ancient, made by able Ar|ti&s;ts, and very well pre&s;erv'd, are magnificent proofs of the Riches of this <HI>Mu&s;aeum.</HI> There is al&s;o a portion of the Cro&s;s, a Thorn of the Crown, and one of the four Nails which fa|&s;ten'd our Saviour <HI>J.C.</HI> to the Cro&s;s, which, in my opinion, de&s;erve the Ve|neration of all Chri&s;tians; be&s;ides a great number of other Relicks richly enchas'd. The Gold, Ivory, and Pre|cious-Stones, dazle the Eyes even of tho&s;e that are accu&s;tom'd to behold 'em: Among the&s;e is to be more e&s;pe|cially admir'd, an Emerald-Cup of the bigne&s;s of an ordinary Bowl or Bea|ker, and the pieces that have been cut out in making it hollow, &s;erve as a compleat Furniture for the Empre&s;s.
<PB N="12" REF="10">
Whence (my Lord) can we &s;uppo&s;e this Precious-Stone to have taken its ri&s;e? Tho&s;e of this Sublunary World, are not of &s;o prodigious a Thickne&s;s; indeed, there &s;eems to be &s;omewhat above the effort of Nature in its in|e&s;timable Ma&s;s; as to its colour and quality 'tis an Emerald, but in reality, with re&s;pect to its extent and thickne&s;s 'tis a perfect Miracle. The next thing remarkable, is, a large Plate of Oriental Agate about t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o Foot in Diameter, on which is engrav'd in the Sub&s;tance of the Stone the word XPICTOC, with a B. &s;et before it, which may be inter|preted <GAP DESC="foreign">, according to the man|ner of writing ob&s;erv'd in the Medals of the ancient Emperors of <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple.</HI> Here it cannot be determin'd what ought to be mo&s;t admir'd, whether the Matter or Forms, the prodigality or the de&s;ign of Natur. There are &s;uch huge Ve&s;&s;els of Rock Chry&s;tal, that &s;o large ones of common Chry&s;tal are not to be found el&s;ewhere. There is al&s;o a Pre&s;s full of Pieces of wrought Amber. Of
<PB N="13" REF="10">
the infinite number of Agates, I &s;hall only mention the large ancient one; it is an almo&s;t &s;quare Stone, broader than high, on which are engrav'd twelve or fifteen Figures, repre&s;enting the Triumph of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors over the <HI>Germans,</HI> a little after the Nativity of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> It has been very learn|edly explain'd by the Emperor's Libra|ry-keeper, and I am apt to believe that it was engrav'd by the &s;ame hand; the Heads of Princes only are drawn in the Original, and tho&s;e of Slaves appear in the Graving; perhaps &s;ome other Per&s;ons may engrave it better, but it is indeed one of the be&s;t Pieces of Antiquity that are now extant.</P>
<P>In another Chamber is to be &s;een the Image of <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with his Arms of Ma&s;&s;ive Gold laden with Diamonds: This &s;tately Effigies an&s;wers well the Character of &s;o great a Prince, who di&s;pers'd his Riches throughout the World, and tran&s;ported <HI>Peru</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI> There is kept the Buff-Coat of Mail, which <HI>Gu&s;tavus
<PB N="14" REF="11">
Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Sweden</HI> wore at the Battel of <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where he peri&s;h'd with the Fortune of his Party. I know not well how to come to a Conclu&s;ion, &s;ince all the Pieces are &s;till repre&s;ented fre&s;h to my Eyes, &s;o that I &s;hall always retain the <HI>Idea</HI> of 'em during my whole Life, and will without doubt continue very lively, till I have communicated it to your Highne&s;s. Mr. <HI>Vander Bar|ren</HI> fir&s;t &s;hew'd me the&s;e Repo&s;itories, to who&s;e Cu&s;tody they are both com|mitted: Although I &s;hou'd declare that his Merit is extraordinary, that he is a good Clergy-man, and a profound Scholar, and a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Per|&s;on; and that he enjoys all tho&s;e excel|lent Qualities with the Favour of his Ma&s;ter, which are things very incom|patible; I &s;hou'd not be judg'd guilty of Flattery, &s;ince every one gives the &s;ame Character of him. His Imperial Maje&s;ty commanded that the other &s;hou'd be &s;hewn to me, and I was not capable of receiving a greater Honour, nor of bringing a more agreeable Di&s;|po&s;ition

<P>Wou'd it not be too hard a Task (my Lord) to di&s;cour&s;e to you con|cerning his Imperial Maje&s;ty, with &s;uch mean Conceptions as mine? Cou'd they form any tolerable <HI>Idea,</HI> or repre&s;ent a Character in any wi&s;e &s;ui|table to &s;o great an Hero? I had in|deed the Honour to be in his Maje|&s;ty's Pre&s;ence in his Gallery of Paint|ings, when he was vi&s;iting his Trea&s;ure of ancient Medals: There I had an op|portunity to &s;ee during three hours and a half, a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor conver&s;ing with his Predece&s;&s;ors, which cou'd not be ob&s;erv'd el&s;ewhere: There, a more di&s;cerning and &s;ublime Judgment than mine might have made a Compari&s;on between 'em on the very &s;pot: In my opinion, the Lu&s;tre of the deceas'd Princes did not &s;eem to eclip&s;e that of the living Emperor, in who&s;e Per&s;on I &s;aw concenter'd all that I knew, and
<PB N="17" REF="12">
every thing that I had read concern|ing others: His profound Judgment, his exemplary Piety, Ju&s;tice and Cle|mency, are con&s;picuous in &s;o high a degree of Perfection, that a faint <HI>Idea</HI> of 'em is only to be &s;een in the World. Your Highne&s;s is &s;en&s;ible that extraor|dinary Virtues are often incompatible, and that that Soul which is &s;o happy as to po&s;&s;e&s;s 'em all, does not always find an equal &s;upply for all, during its Intercour&s;e with the Body, from whence it cannot pa&s;s. Thus we rarely ob|&s;erve Magnanimity and Fortitude, in|termix'd with that Gentlene&s;s and Moderation, which are requi&s;ite for the compleat Formation of Piety and Clemency in the Heart of a Prince: But in his Imperial Maje&s;ty, all the&s;e Heroick Qualities which are &s;o much admir'd, proceed from a more noble Principle, that enforces Nature, and admini&s;ters Relief to the Weakne&s;&s;es of the Body. This is that Divine Character which Heaven imprints on the Minds of all tho&s;e of this Augu&s;t Family: This
<PB N="18" REF="13">
is that &s;econd Soul which the Philo&s;o|phers have attributed to Hero's, which is the cau&s;e that he who is at pre&s;ent advanc'd to the highe&s;t degree of Dig|nity on Earth, is at the &s;ame time a potent Emperor, a virtuous Prince, an accompli&s;h'd Politician, and a good Chri&s;tian, and hath all &s;ociable Virtues united in his Per&s;on in a perfect Agree|ment, which will con&s;titute the Hap|pine&s;s of the Empire, as &s;oon as it &s;hall be in a condition to an&s;wer thereto, and &s;hall have merited of Heaven &s;o many Ble&s;&s;ings, which it may receive from his Hands, and under the Government of &s;o excellent a Sovereign, and &s;o prudent an Emperor.</P>

Courteou&s;ne&s;s and Affabili|ty: I know not by what means his Imperial Maje&s;ty is more e&s;pecially become a publick Ble&s;&s;ing to &s;o many Illu&s;trious Lords that depend on him, whether by the Riches or Preferments he be&s;tows on 'em, or by the &s;ingu|lar Example he &s;hews 'em. How|ever I &s;hall give an account to your Highne&s;s of &s;ome of their Per&s;ons and Qualities, &s;uch as mo&s;t readily occur to my Memory. The Prince of <HI>Lob|kowitz,</HI> who is Comptroller of the Hou&s;hold, <HI>Der Ober&s;te Hoffmei&s;ter,</HI> has the fir&s;t Station in the Court; his Fa|ther being High Chancellor of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> was created a Prince by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. <HI>A.D.</HI> 1626, but he cou'd not enjoy the Privileges of this Dignity in the Diet of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> and his Son was admitted thereto, by the Intere&s;t he had with the Emperor, and by the Exigency of Affairs.</P>
<P>Count <HI>John Maximilian</HI> of <HI>Lam|berg</HI> is High Chamberlain, and the principal Confident of his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty:

He has a &s;hare in the tran&s;|acting of all Publick Affairs, and he is acknowledg'd by the common Con|&s;ent of the People to be a Per&s;on that perfectly an&s;wers &s;o great a Chara|cter; for he is endu'd with a &s;agaci|ous Judgment, and a vigorous Di&s;po|&s;ition, join'd with Learning and Expe|rience: Indeed his Emba&s;&s;ies in <HI>Spain,</HI> and to the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> have made him known throughout the whole Continent of <HI>Europe:</HI> In &s;hort, he is belov'd and e&s;teem'd by the Emperor even to the highe&s;t degree, and all Men are &s;o well per&s;waded of his Me|rit, that none envies him the happine&s;s of his Station.</P>

<PB N="21" REF="14">
<HI>Vienna</HI> about three thou&s;and of 'em, lodg'd in very convenient Appartments in a Burgh that bears their Name, di|&s;tant about two or three hundred Paces from the City, which they may enter whenever they think fit, except on <HI>Sa|turdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays,</HI> being prohibited on tho&s;e days by virtue of their Super&s;ti|tion, and the Chri&s;tian Religion; but if they &s;hou'd act otherwi&s;e than ac|cording to this Order, they wou'd run the hazard of being cut in pieces. <HI>Lim|naeus</HI> propounds whether it be expedi|ent for a Prince to tolerate 'em in his Dominions, and produces the affirma|tive and negative Arguments, but I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent engage in the De|bate. They have three Synagogues in <HI>Vienna,</HI> though at <HI>Francfurt</HI> they are allow'd but one, and are there more numerous. I was told one day a Story in the &s;ame place which &s;eem'd to me very plea&s;ant: A certain <HI>German</HI> di&s;|puted in <HI>Latin</HI> with a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Phy&s;i|cian, and pre&s;s'd him to acknowledge the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> citing &s;ome
<PB N="22" REF="15">
Pa&s;&s;ages which he &s;hew'd in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> in the Prophecies and other Places of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament;</HI> in&s;omuch that the Doctor, who cou'd not find &s;ufficient Proofs to maintain his Argument, told him at la&s;t; Will not you grant, that our Religion was given us by the true God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and that he made a Covenant with us? The <HI>German</HI> readily acknowledg'd it; then reply'd the <HI>Jew,</HI> When you can demon&s;trate to me that your Religion proceeds from God, by as good Te&s;ti|monies as we prove ours, all will be well. The <HI>German</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, was endu'd with more Zeal than Di&s;|cretion: For (my Lord) what an&s;wer wou'd the <HI>Jew</HI> have made, if any Man had reply'd to him? This Religion was given you as a Preparative for the accompli&s;hment of the Promi&s;es, and this Covenant as a Type or Figure of the true one, to be afterward made by the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias:</HI> Now if the Promi&s;es are apparently accompli&s;h'd, and if the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> be already come, your Religion
<PB N="23" REF="15">
and your Covenant or Di&s;pen&s;ation are terminated. Therefore according to the Rules of an equitable Argumen|tation, it is not &s;ufficient for you to prove the Continuation of your Re|ligion and your Covenant, by the Set|tlement which God made with your Ance&s;tors; but it lies upon you to prove it by a Negative; that is to &s;ay, by &s;hewing in the Holy Scriptures which are common to us, that the <HI>Me|&s;&s;ias,</HI> who ought to con&s;ummate all things, is not as yet come. Indeed their Misfortune is very great in regard that 'tis grounded upon the Word of God. The <HI>Jews</HI> are extremely ob&s;ti|nate in their Opinions, and very Su|per&s;titious, yet they are mi&s;erable, and every where laden with the Publick Hatred. I have had &s;ome concern with 'em, but none relating either to Religion or State Affairs; and have purchas'd of 'em divers extraordina|ry ancient Medals; they are ea&s;ily wrought upon, becau&s;e Ignorant, o|therwi&s;e they are well skill d in Arith|metick.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="16">The Counts of <HI>Dietrich&s;tein</HI> and <HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> are al&s;o principal Officers in the Emperor's Court; the former is the Gentleman of the Hor&s;e, and the other the Great Hunt&s;man, both mo&s;t worthy of their Ma&s;ter's Favour.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Trauth&s;on</HI> is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Lords of this Court: He is a very ingenious Per&s;on, and has in his Repo&s;itory all manner of Curio|&s;ities, <HI>viz.</HI> Books, ancient and modern Medals, Paintings, Agates, Marcha&s;ites, <HI>Indian</HI> Rarities, and in &s;hort, every thing that can be imagin'd.

a Cherry-&s;tone on which are engrav'd above an hundred Portraitures, with different Ornaments of the Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Crowns, Diadems, Mitres, Cowls, Hats, Hoods, and Commodes for Wo|men of various &s;orts. This is to bring Art to its heighe&s;t pitch of Perfection, to comprehend &s;uch variety of Works within &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, and even in a manner to proceed as far as Nature it &s;elf, which animates Atoms, and gives 'em organical Parts. I &s;hall al&s;o make mention to your Highne&s;s of an Ame|thy&s;te Cup that I &s;aw there, it &s;eems to be as fine as tho&s;e fabulous Cups with which the Gods were wont to Carow&s;e; and indeed, if the Fable cou'd impo&s;e on our Eyes as well as Mind, one wou'd be apt to believe it. This Lord has the &s;tatelie&s;t Palace, and the mo&s;t &s;pacious Garden in all <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> which is altogether extended in length, or at lea&s;t very near from the very City Gates of <HI>Vienna</HI> to the <HI>Da|nube.</HI> His Grand-Father was the Fa|vourite of <HI>Rodolph</HI> II.; and I am of

<P>If your Highne&s;s requir'd an Account of the other illu&s;trious and ingenious Per&s;ons of <HI>Vienna,</HI> you wou'd engage me to make mention of too many, nei|ther do I know all: But I cannot for|get Mon&s;ieur <HI>Schrimpf,</HI> who is Re&s;ident to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and many other Princes and States of the Empire. <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> might be endu'd with as much Virtue, and as generous a Di&s;po&s;ition as he, but (according to my Judgment) not with more. His Liberality was &s;o great as to offer me what&s;oever Rarity I cou'd find in his Hou&s;e, which ob|lig'd me to take a Re&s;olution to com|mend nothing any longer in his pre|&s;ence; neverthele&s;s I did not refu&s;e all the Pre&s;ents which he thought fit to make me, and I hope e're long to &s;hew &s;ome of 'em to your Highne&s;s.</P>

Maje&s;ty, who delights very much in Hunting, and &s;ometimes by that means recreates his Spirits, wearied with the Fatigues that are in&s;eparable from the Management of the Publick Affairs of the Empire. I had a &s;ight of the Em|peror in a Fore&s;t about three Leagues from <HI>Vienna</HI> to the North, where his Grand Hunt&s;man had caus'd a Tent to be prepar'd for him, under which he was with the Empre&s;s and tho&s;e Courtiers whom he had &s;ent for thi|ther: I was there in the Retinue of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Baden Durlach,</HI> a Prince whom you know (my Lord) to be Learned, Judicious, and as well vers'd in Civil as Military Affairs. The Hun|ters &s;tarted a great number of Stags and Hinds, which were con&s;train'd to run round the Tent by rea&s;on of the Gins that were laid on all &s;ides. The Empre&s;s fir&s;t fir'd at 'em with a Har|quebu&s;s, and the Emperor &s;hot nine or ten &s;everal times within the &s;pace of an Hour.

not confin'd as every where el&s;e, to a certain Place, and to certain Oppertu|nities, but they are us'd upon all occa|&s;ions, they always begin and end with 'em; and it may be avouch'd that in the whole cour&s;e of their Life and Con|ver&s;ation, they are the fir&s;t Matter, of which the re&s;t of their Actions and Af|fairs is the Form.

<PB N="50" REF="29">
it be a &s;ort of Folly that has its lucid Intervals; or whether it be a kind of Di&s;cretion, &s;ubject to Weakne&s;&s;es and Periodical tran&s;ports, or to &s;peak more politely to your Highne&s;s, whether it be an intermitting Folly or Prudence. However, it does not otherwi&s;e corrupt the manners of the <HI>Germans;</HI> for cer|tainly they are the be&s;t natur'd People in the World, provided &s;ome of 'em be excepted that are not &s;o: They are en|du'd with Probity, Genero&s;ity, Court|eou&s;ne&s;s and a temper entirely addicted to Equity. The&s;e excellent endow|ments, are as it were natural to 'em, and to be found even among tho&s;e that have no advantage of Education: Per|haps this is the Rea&s;on why they are belov'd of all Nations, altho they do not take any con&s;iderable Mea&s;ures to Court 'em at home, and they have no regard to 'em, but proportionably as they conform them&s;elves to their man|ner of Living. They have a greater &s;tock of Di&s;cretion than of quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and more Judgment
<PB N="51" REF="29">
than Politene&s;s of Wit: Their Gravity tho' &s;omewhat Terre&s;trial is of Singular u&s;e to 'em as well in the management of important Negociations as in their ordinary Commerce: It al&s;o di&s;po&s;es 'em to make great progre&s;s in the &s;tudy of all manner of Humane Literature; in&s;omuch that there are many profound Scholars among 'em, and none that has not &s;ome tincture of Learning.

<P>The Art of Phy&s;ick is practis'd in tho&s;e Parts quite otherwi&s;e than at <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> and if you except a &s;mall number of its Profe&s;&s;ors, the latter are more Learned, and the others talk of nothing but extraordinary Secrets and Miracles. One Grain of their black, yellow or white Powder is &s;ufficient (as they &s;ay) to cure all &s;orts of Di&s;ea&s;es, but the e|vent does not an&s;wer their Promi&s;e. They that have &s;tudy'd mo&s;t have not the greate&s;t employment in that Coun|try no more than el&s;ewhere: The hap|pine&s;s of a Phy&s;itian is there owing to a certain blind Fortune, that I know not how to explain to you, but which u&s;ually depends upon the vogue of the common People, I mean tho&s;e that un|&s;tand nothing at all of the Art. A &s;ick Per&s;on is ea&s;ily per&s;waded to re&s;ign him|&s;elf into the hands of an Empyrick, that promi&s;es him a Cure within Twenty four Hours, but he is often not in a con|dition

<P>The very diver&s;ity of Judgments and Opinions has its u&s;efulne&s;s among Men: For it animates and &s;tirs up the Mind to a &s;earch after Truth, and clears it from heavine&s;s by keeping it in action; It introduces all tho&s;e different manners of Living that appear &s;o admirable in the World.

If I were permit|ted (my Lord) to take a flight where my Imagination leads me; might it not be affirm'd, that Man is born with a certain univer&s;al Di&s;po&s;ition to all the Natures of Animals; that Rea&s;on makes him a Man, and that by his exorbitant Pa&s;&s;ions he becomes a brute Bea&s;t of one kind or other, according to the in|clination with which he is carry'd a|way?

<P>After having ob&s;erv'd the Out|works of the Ca&s;tle, its Situation, the order of the Buildings and the Fortifi|cations, I enter'd and apply'd my &s;elf entirely to the Enjoyment of tho&s;e in|comparable Trea&s;ures. The fir&s;t things that offer'd them&s;elves to my view,
<PB N="81" REF="44">
were &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;orts of Stones, of which the old <HI>Romans</HI> were wont to make u&s;e to mark the di&s;tances of Pla|ces, which were counted in tho&s;e times by <HI>tertio aut quarto ab &V;rbe Lapide,</HI> i. e. <HI>The third or fourth Stone from the City:</HI> Some of 'em had no In&s;criptions, and tho&s;e that had any, were conformable to what I have read in ancient Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>From thence I pa&s;s'd into two Gal|leries full of all &s;orts of different Armour, which are now in u&s;e, and were &s;o in former Ages: They induc'd me to make this Reflection, that Men notwith&s;tand|ing that they might wear Skins of Iron and Steel, or at lea&s;t, Cloaths made of tho&s;e Materials, were neverthele&s;s nei|ther invulnerable nor immortal. I there &s;aw the Arms of the two <HI>Maxi|milians,</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> V. and of &s;ome o|ther Emperors, as al&s;o tho&s;e of <HI>Fran|cis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> with the Garment which he wore at the Battel of <HI>Pavia,</HI> which makes me call to mind, that I had already &s;een one in the Repo&s;itory of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> &s;o that he either put on two Suits of Cloaths on that day, or they
<PB N="82" REF="45">
were divided on purpo&s;e to &s;pread a|broad the fame of the Victory, at <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els</HI> and <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI> There are al&s;o to be &s;een tho&s;e of <HI>Charles</HI> IX. King of <HI>France;</HI> of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> Kings of <HI>Spain;</HI> of <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and of many other Princes. I was told that the&s;e la&s;t were the very &s;ame that he wore at the famous Battel of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> But I &s;pent &s;ome time in viewing tho&s;e of <HI>Alexander. Farne&s;e</HI> Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> Go|vernour of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> recolle|cting what I had read in <HI>Strada</HI> con|cerning the notable Exploits of this Prince: I know not whether any thing were wanting to his Merit; but I am per|&s;waded that his Hi&s;tory cannot be better writ, and that even the actions of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> the great are not &s;et off to more advantage by Hi&s;toriographers than his. I admir'd the Arms of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Great, which as yet &s;trike Terror into the Minds of Beholders, and I re|member with &s;ome Con&s;ternation, that this <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperor once caus'd the whole World to tremble. The Arms of the mo&s;t part of the renowned Gene|rals
<PB N="83" REF="45">
of the&s;e later Times, are in like manner kept in the &s;ame Repo&s;itory. The Arch-Duke <HI>Ferdinand</HI> made this Conque&s;t; cou'd any Man proceed farther (my Lord) than to di&s;arm &s;o many Heroes? But this was only an amicable Conque&s;t, this Prince who was the mo&s;t excellent Antiquary of all that govern'd in his Age knew well what value ought to be &s;et upon tho&s;e precious Spoils; He was de&s;irous to ob|tain 'em every where, and was even &s;ometimes prevented: I am apt to be|lieve that they were offer'd to him, le&s;t not being &s;ought for, they &s;hou'd not have the good Fortune to be &s;o glori|ou&s;ly con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>At the end of one of the Galleries, I &s;aw the repre&s;entation of a Giant and a Dwarf, the living Originals of which had &s;ometime re&s;ided at <HI>Vienna.</HI> Indeed this exorbitant inequality of Stature be|tween two Men, is a very &s;trange thing; the Elder of the&s;e was not able to reach with his Hand to the Navel of the o|ther, yet a Ballad was made concern|ing a Box on the Ear, which was gi|ven
<PB N="84" REF="46">
by this Dwarf to the Giant: It is true, that the later &s;toopt to take up the Emperor's Glove, who had let it fall on purpo&s;e to facilitate the giving of the Box o' th' Ear. The&s;e &s;ports of Nature are &s;till much e&s;teem'd at <HI>Vi|enna,</HI> either becau&s;e her Ability in for|ming Men of quite different &s;orts and &s;izes is there admir'd; or her Error in &s;ometimes making much more, or el&s;e much le&s;s than &s;he ought. Their Im|perial Maje&s;ties likewi&s;e maintain &s;ome of the&s;e Giants and Dwarfs in their Court, whom I cou'd never behold without a kind of Horror, in regard that they are &s;o far from the ordinary proportion and &s;ize of other Men.</P>
<P>In a &s;pacious Hall are to be &s;een all the &s;everal &s;orts of Garments which the <HI>Turks</HI> are wont to wear both in their Hou&s;es and in the Camp. There are many rich Ve&s;ts in which the price, quality, quantity and colour of the Stuff of which they are made, &s;hew the natural Di&s;po&s;ition of this Nation to Luxury and Magnificence. This man|ner of attiring &s;urpa&s;&s;es all ours, that
<PB N="85" REF="46">
are introduc'd purely by a fanta&s;tical Humour, and the continual change of which denotes but too much Levity. If we cou'd be once per&s;waded to imi|tate this Augu&s;t manner of Apparel|ling, and to appear in the&s;e magnifi|cent pieces of Drapery, perhaps we &s;hou'd continue the u&s;e of 'em, and our Fa&s;hion might turn to a &s;ettl'd Cu|&s;tom as among the <HI>Levantines.</HI> And indeed, the&s;e Infidels have got the ad|vantage in this re&s;pect, in&s;omuch that one of their <HI>Vi&s;iers,</HI> one day told the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, that the <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> were apt to deride, but were not well clad: The <HI>Venetian</HI> might have reply'd el&s;ewhere than at the Port; 'tis true, but 'tis pity to &s;ee &s;uch Swine as you attir'd with the Ornaments of So|vereign Princes. I al&s;o ob&s;erv'd there, Turbans of a hundred various Fa&s;hi|ons, and one wou'd not imagine, that they had all the &s;ame u&s;e: The fine&s;t of 'em have a kind of &s;tately Air, and notwith&s;tanding whatever our nice Fa&s;hion-mongers may affirm to the contrary, the&s;e Mountains of Linnen-Cloath

that &s;erve &s;o well to adorn the Heads of the&s;e Barbarians, wou'd not di&s;gui&s;e our Hero's; for they really im|plant Grandeur and Severity in the Countenance, which wou'd even &s;et off Maje&s;ty it &s;elf. Afterward I took a view of divers Cimeters or Hangers of great value for the rich Ornaments with which they are cover'd, and al&s;o upon account of their rare Temper, &s;o that Fury it &s;elf might well go to work with the&s;e Weapons. La&s;tly, all man|ner of choice Rarities of this Country are to be found Here.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Hall are two Figures that repre&s;ent two <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lords on Hor&s;e-back, and I ob&s;erv'd in 'em as great an Air of Grandeur, Gravity and Stateline&s;s, as is po&s;&s;ible for Art to ex|pre&s;s in Copies, but 'tis probable that the Originals were quite another thing. One of the&s;e Per&s;onages was <HI>Aga</HI> of the Janizaries, and the other <HI>Beglerbeg</HI> or Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Offen</HI> or <HI>Buda.</HI> They were ta|ken Pri&s;oners upon different occa&s;ions, and gave as a part of their Ran&s;om their mo&s;t &s;umptuous Equipage; which
<PB N="87" REF="47">
is very carefully pre&s;erv'd, and well de&s;erves to be &s;o: For not only the Garments, but the Hor&s;e-cloath, Sad|dles and Bridles were all be&s;et with Ru|bies, Emeralds, Grenats, Topaz-&s;tones and Pearls, being &s;o many profu&s;e Trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I enter'd another Gallery full of Paintings of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters, although it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that they are not all choice ones as tho&s;e at <HI>Vienna.</HI> I apply'd my &s;elf more particularly to the viewing of the Portraiture of a cer|tain <HI>Hungarian</HI> Noble-man, which is not &s;o much to be admir'd for the ex|cellency of the Draught, as for the Pro|digy which it repre&s;ents, <HI>viz.</HI> a Wound made with a Lance in the Eye, which penetrated into the Sub&s;tance of the Brain, even to the hinder part of the Head, and yet did not prove Mortal. This is a Secret of Nature, that is al|together hid from us, and which con|founds all our Argumentations.</P>
<P>I did not allow my &s;elf time &s;uffici|ent to examine the&s;e Paintings in par|ticular, becau&s;e I was diverted by the
<PB N="88" REF="48">
variety of other things that were not &s;o common. Amid&s;t a great quantity of Stags Horns, which are there very extraordinary, I ob&s;erv'd one as it were mortis'd in a Trunk of Oak, &s;o neatly that the Artifice cannot be per|ceiv'd; it was cut on purpo&s;e to be plac'd among the other Rarities. Upon this occa&s;ion I remember that pair of Stags Horns which I &s;aw (my Lord) amid&s;t &s;o many others, in your Guard-Chamber at <HI>Stugart,</HI> which are &s;o in|tangl'd one with another, that they &s;eem &s;till to expre&s;s the Fury of the two Animals, which wou'd never cea&s;e but with their Life.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Gallery &s;eems to be divi|ved into two by twenty Pre&s;&s;es, twelve Foot high and &s;ix broad, where all the riche&s;t and choice&s;t Rarities are depo|&s;ited: In the fir&s;t are contain'd divers pieces of Alaba&s;ter and Marble, who&s;e Colours and various Figures dazzle the Eyes of the Beholders: In the &s;econd is a va&s;t quantity of Gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els, and every thing that can be imagin'd inge|nious in the Art of Gla&s;s-work: In the third is Coral of all kinds and of all
<PB N="89" REF="48">
&s;orts of Colours, <HI>viz.</HI> white, red, black, grey and violet-colour'd: There are &s;ome pieces of it in the form of Plants, Shrubs and Branches, and others are wrought in the &s;hape of a Man's Head, of a Rock, of a pair of Beads, and an infinite number of other Figures: in the fourth are found wrought Precious-&s;tones both ancient and modern, the mo&s;t part of which are Agats, Ja&s;pars and Cornelians: There are al&s;o Rocks be&s;et with Pearls and rich Stones; and in &s;hort, the Jewels of this nature are &s;o numerous, that this Pre&s;s alone is an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure. In the fifth are pre&s;erv'd Urns of red Earth, and others of Porcelane of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> among which are ob&s;erv'd &s;ome counterfeit; they are the common ones that come from <HI>Holland,</HI> which have been put in vogue on purpo&s;e to &s;ave a greater ex|pence: But do not imagine (my Lord) that they are plac'd there to make up the number, there is a quite different de&s;ign and meaning as to this matter: For &s;uper fine things ever appear more illu&s;trious, when accompany'd with
<PB N="90" REF="49">
ordinary ones, and the Compari&s;on made between 'em &s;erves to enhance their Value. Thus an <HI>Aethiopian</HI> is &s;ometimes painted &s;tanding near a beau|tiful Woman, and it tends to her ad|vantage; for the Deformity that ap|pears at her &s;ide, &s;erves as a foil to &s;et off her Beauty with more charm|ing Lu&s;tre: Thus the light of a Torch that grows pale in the Sun, &s;hines bright and &s;parkles in the dark.</P>
<P>In the other Pre&s;&s;es are contain'd Curio&s;ities of all &s;orts, but a larger De&s;cription of 'em wou'd tire your Highne&s;s's Patience: Therefore I &s;hall leave it to &s;peak only of tho&s;e kinds of Matters, of which you &s;eem to require a more exact Account. There is a Collection of ancient Gold Medals from <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Heraclius;</HI> being the mo&s;t perfect of all that ever I &s;aw, both with re&s;pect to the number of the Coins and their Beauty: It wou'd be very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to find el&s;e|where any Medals that are more rare, or have been better pre&s;erv'd. There is al&s;o another Collection of tho&s;e of the
<PB N="91" REF="49">
Con&s;uls and Emperors, and a prodi|gious quantity of Silver-Medals, but tho&s;e of Copper are infinitely more precious than all the others. None but a Prince &s;o much addicted to Cu|rio&s;ity and &s;o Learned, cou'd be capa|ble of making &s;o good a Choice, or of defraying the charge of &s;o expen&s;ive an Undertaking. When his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hall have joyn'd the&s;e incom|parable Pieces to as many others that are in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I am per|&s;waded that his Repo&s;itory, and that of the King, will be the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Is it not rea&s;on|able that the choice&s;t Rarities &s;hou'd be &s;har'd between the two greate&s;t Princes in the World, and that tho&s;e venerable Monuments of Antiquity &s;hou'd find &s;uch &s;ecure Sanctuaries, again&s;t the injuries of Time, and the accidents of bad Fortune.</P>
<P>It is now time to declare &s;omewhat to your Highne&s;s concerning that in|comparable Arch-Duke, who in en|deavouring to gratify his Curio&s;ity and to divert him&s;elf, found means to ad|vance
<PB N="92" REF="50">
his Glory; neither did tho&s;e cu|rious Enquiries, exhau&s;t his Spirits, but only afforded &s;ome Relaxation to his noble Soul, which was by that means better di&s;pos'd to the practice of Ver|tue. His Life was as glorious as pro|fitable to the Age in which he liv'd. The Siege of <HI>Sigeth</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> which he forc'd the <HI>Turk</HI> to rai&s;e, is an ever|la&s;ting Monument of his Valour, and the Trea&s;ures of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, which he has re-collected and re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in their primitive Lu&s;tre, will be &s;o many Heralds to proclaim the great Obligations which he has laid upon all his Po&s;terity, and more e&s;pe|cially upon the Republick of Learning. If &s;o great Veneration is u&s;ually paid to the Memory of Hi&s;torians, only be|cau&s;e they have tran&s;mitted &s;ome Co|pies of Antiquity, with what tran|&s;ports of Zeal ought we to expre&s;s our Gratitude to a Prince who has furni&s;h|ed us with the very Originals, and gi|ven us the Enjoyment even of Antiqui|ty it &s;elf? A <HI>Roman</HI> Senator who was advanc'd to the Imperial Dignity, e|&s;teem'd
<PB N="93" REF="50">
it an honour to his Family, to reckon <HI>Tacitus</HI> the Hi&s;torian among his Ance&s;tors: Who then can doubt but that the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> do &s;till call to mind with great delight, that an Arch-Duke of their Noble Stock, has been the Re&s;torer of Truth, and of &s;o many Rarities of which we had been almo&s;t entirely de|priv'd by Ignorance and the injury of Time? This one Con&s;ideration of his Merit is alone &s;ufficient to &s;upply us with Matter for a Panegyrick.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to add a Word or two concerning the Library, &s;ince it ows its original to this Prince: There are not any Books contain'd therein, but &s;uch as are more correct and of the be&s;t Editions. I have ob|&s;erv'd a con&s;iderable number of 'em, that more e&s;pecially treat of the My|&s;teries of the Curious, as al&s;o many that I did not know, and perhaps &s;uch as are not to be met with el&s;ewhere. The Portraiture of the greater part of tho&s;e Authors who&s;e Learning has made 'em famous throughout the World
<PB N="94" REF="51">
&s;erve as the peculiar Ornaments of this Library. This indeed, is properly to a&s;&s;o|ciate the Fathers with the Children, to place the Learned amid&s;t their Books.</P>
<P>I know not how to leave <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> without mentioning to your Highne&s;s certain brazen Figures or Statues, which I &s;aw in the principal Church. They are Twenty eight in number, about nine or ten Foot high, and altho' the Materials of which every one of 'em is made, amount to the value of two or three thou&s;and Crowns; neverthele&s;s the Workman&s;hip is infinitely more precious. I there di&s;cover'd many Em|perors and Arch-Dukes; and took par|ticular notice of the four Dukes of <HI>Bur|gundy,</HI> and their Heire&s;s <HI>Mary,</HI> who&s;e Wealth and Power have render'd the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> formidable to all <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> There was no need of reading the Names that are engrav'd over the&s;e Statues, I knew the very Air of their Countenance, which I had before ob|&s;erv d in &s;o many Medals and Prints, and the Proportion is &s;o exact, that I ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd 'em, even at the fir&s;t &s;ight.
<PB N="95" REF="51">
The&s;e Images are al&s;o repre&s;ented up|on Bra&s;s Cuts and illu&s;trated, with an Hi&s;torical De&s;cription, &s;o that they may well de&s;erve a place in a Prince's Repo&s;itory: If your Highne&s;s be of this opinion, I &s;hall take it as an Ho|nour to be permitted to augment your Library with a Set of 'em, which I have in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to give a good de|&s;cription of the <HI>Genius</HI> or natural Di&s;|po&s;ition of the <HI>Tirolians;</HI> who are nei|ther <HI>Italians</HI> nor <HI>Germans,</HI> but both to|gether. There may be &s;ome variety of Matter, with which to entertain your Highne&s;s, concerning the Judg|ment that ought to be made with re|&s;pect to the&s;e People, who equally partake of the Qualities of two very dif|ferent Nations that border upon 'em. For a Que&s;tion has been propounded long ago, whether contrary Tempe|raments are brought to Perfection, or &s;poil'd in the Mixture: Some Per&s;ons affirm that the Quickne&s;s and Subtilty of <HI>Italy</HI> is meliorated by being &s;ome|what allay d with the Phlegmatick
<PB N="96" REF="52">
Temper of <HI>Germany,</HI> and that this Phlegm likewi&s;e &s;tands in need of Vi|vacity to animate it: Others are of o|pinion, that this &s;ubtil Spirit beyond the Mountains, has its tincture of Me|lancholy, which &s;erves to &s;et it off, that a mixture of a gro&s;&s;er &s;ort of Blood wou'd dimini&s;h its lu&s;tre, and that the &s;lowne&s;s of the <HI>Germans</HI> has a Solidity, which cannot be refin'd without weak|ning it. Your Highne&s;s is a much more competent Judge than I, what Party 'tis requi&s;ite to follow, but if you &s;hou'd enjoin me to declare my opinion as to this matter, I wou'd en|treat you to permit me to do it only to your &s;elf in private.</P>
<P>To take breath again a little, will your Highne&s;s vouch&s;afe to give me leave to &s;peak a Word or two to you concerning my Ho&s;t at <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI> Upon account of the uncertainty of my abode in this Town, which might perhaps continue for &s;ome days, I order'd my Servant to treat with him about my Expences, and they agreed for two Florins and a half a day, neverthele&s;s

when he was ready to pay according to this Price, the Landlord wou'd not be &s;atisfied, and alledg'd for an Excu&s;e, that the Entertainment indeed did not exceed the Price agreed upon, but that he was oblig'd to act conformably there|to only with the ordinary &s;ort of Peo|ple; that for a Per&s;on of Quality as I was, the Price ought to be proportionably enhanc'd; that he was a&s;ham'd not to have a greater regard to me than to o|thers; and that he knew too well the Honour and Re&s;pect that was due to me, to &s;tand to his fir&s;t bargain. This was not altogether to pay for Quality, but 'twas a Device to put me upon pur|cha&s;ing Re&s;pect at a very dear rate.</P>

large, well built, extremely populous and very rich. All its Outworks and Avenues lie open and wa&s;te, and the neare&s;t Villages are &s;ituated at a great di&s;tance, &s;o that a Man enters a Plain convenient for Hunting, even as &s;oon as he has &s;et a foot out of the Gates. I hap|pen'd to arrive there at a very &s;ea&s;on|able time, for the whole Town was ta|ken up with a pompous Solemnity ce|lebrated in memory of the famous Bat|tel of <HI>Prague:</HI> Your mo&s;t Serene High|ne&s;s is not ignorant how much this Vi|ctory contributed to the good Fortune of its Prince, for it &s;ecur'd the tranquil|lity of his Dominions, caus'd the Electo|ral Dignity to pa&s;s into his Family, and made him Ma&s;ter of the upper <HI>Palati|nate;</HI> all which advantages cannot but wonderfully augment his Power and Authority. The State and even private Per&s;ons &s;par'd no co&s;t to honour the Fe|&s;tival, and Joy appear'd on all &s;ides in the &s;umptuous Apparel and Fea&s;tings, as al&s;o in the Fire-works, Illuminations, the di&s;charging of Artillery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their Electoral Highne&s;&s;es invited the People
<PB N="99" REF="53">
by their Example to return thanks to God for the gaining of this Battel, and thus Piety and Religion were no le&s;s en|gag'd in the Solemnity than Magnifi|cence and Diverti&s;ements.</P>
<P>This Fe&s;tival was follow'd by ano|ther appointed for the Birth-day of the Elect're&s;s. The whole Court &s;hone as it were with a new lu&s;tre, there was no other talk than of Plea&s;ure, and <HI>Germa|ny</HI> &s;eem'd to endeavour to &s;urpa&s;s it &s;elf, by the profu&s;e Expences that were laid out upon this occa&s;ion, and the utmo&s;t extent of Gallantry. The Sumptuou&s;|ne&s;s of the Fea&s;ts appear'd in the good Chear, in the Trea&s;ures of Silver-Plate that were &s;et forth; and in the Con|&s;orts of Mu&s;ick, which &s;erv'd to quic|ken the Delights. The Principal Ladies of the Court waited upon their Electo|ral Highne&s;&s;es, and nothing cou'd be more rich and &s;plendid than their At|tire; in&s;omuch that I fancy'd that I &s;aw <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> attended by the Mu&s;es and their Nymphs.

<P>Nothing appear'd to me more &s;tate|ly than the Carrou&s;el, which was per|form'd in a cover'd Manege or kind of Theatre, &s;eparated from the Palace on|ly by a &s;mall Canal. The Elect're&s;s was conducted to her Balcony by the Elector him&s;elf, and two Galleries &s;itu|ated one over another, that take up the whole compa&s;s of the Building, were fill'd with Spectators, who were at fir&s;t &s;urpris'd by the Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick that appear'd in Pageants made in the form of Ships, every one of which was drawn by &s;ix Hor&s;es; when the&s;e Machines were brought under the Balcony of her Electoral Highne&s;s, the Mu&s;icians be|gan to play and Sing their Parts; nei|ther was there any need of Divination to conjecture that they were Sonnets of Prai&s;e, compos'd on purpo&s;e for the So|lemnity.

<P>I was at fir&s;t introduc'd into the Ap|partment of the Elector him&s;elf, and into a Gallery of Paintings, which were all of exqui&s;ite Beauty: In the &s;paces by which they are &s;eparated, divers Pre&s;&s;es are fixt along the thickne&s;s of the Wall; where I &s;aw as rich Jewels as any that are extant in the World.

<P>But I have in&s;i&s;ted too long upon the&s;e Particulars, when there is occa&s;i|on to &s;ay &s;omewhat concerning the Medals, among which (my Lord) I have &s;een Wonders.

<P>Not but that (my Lord) I might flatter my &s;elf with an A&s;&s;urance of be|ing capable even to offer &s;uch Things as wou'd afford &s;ome kind of Diver&s;ion to your mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s, either upon account of their Novelty or Variety. But (my Lord) how extremely dif|ficult it is! for a Per&s;on endu'd with &s;o mean Abilities as mine are, to entertain a Potent Prince as knowing and judici|ous as your Highne&s;s, and to hope for a good i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch an Entertainment: However (my Lord) you are de&s;irous of it, you are pleas'd to command it, and I am al&s;o &s;en&s;ible that this kind of Pro|logue is offen&s;ive to you. Therefore I &s;hall put an end to my Apology, and yield a ready Obedience without any farther delays.</P>
<P>Nothing affords &s;o much delight and &s;atisfaction as Travelling; (my Lord) your mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s has thought fit to tell me &s;o &s;ometimes, and I have
<PB N="129" REF="69">
ever found it true. Indeed the Epitaph of the great <HI>Trivulcio</HI> might well be ob|jected to me, before-hand, <HI>Hic quie&s;cit qui nunquam quievit. Here rests he that never re&s;ted.</HI> It &s;eems as if the Air which I draw in by Re&s;piration in different Pro|vinces, in&s;pir'd me with new Know|ledge, at lea&s;t it &s;upplies me with Mat|ter for new Meditations; neither do I take any notice of &s;uch &s;orts of Varieties as &s;urpri&s;e the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e that never had a &s;ight of 'em; yet I often find an opportunity to &s;pend my time to better purpo&s;e. I do not in&s;i&s;t on the dif|ference of Habits in every Nation, altho' there are &s;ome &s;o odd, that they even ap|pear ridiculous. I have &s;ometimes &s;ought for the Rea&s;on or Original of 'em, but cou'd never di&s;cover it; neither did I ex|pect to find it any where but in U&s;eful|ne&s;s and Decency, which in my mind, are the two Rules to be ob&s;erv'd in Cloathing. However, I was oblig'd to be content with the ordinary Fa&s;hions, that is to &s;ay, the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Peo|ple who make u&s;e of 'em: Be&s;ides, this Cu&s;tom which <HI>Herodotus</HI> treats with the
<PB N="130" REF="70">
&s;tyle of Royal, is a kind of Supreme Law, more e&s;pecially in <HI>Germany,</HI> where Novelty is not &s;o ea&s;ily admitted as in other Places: Thus a Hou&s;e is u&s;ually rebuilt after the very &s;ame Model that 'twas built in the preceeding Age, and if a Man &s;hou'd go about to per&s;wade a Proprietary never &s;o little to make the Structure more regular, to give it more light, to dimini&s;h the thickne&s;s of its Walls, and to deviate &s;omewhat from the ancient manner of Building, on purpo&s;e to take the advantage of &s;o many Conveniences that ari&s;e from the more refin'd modern Architecture; he wou'd immediately an&s;wer, that he derided the new Mode; that his decea&s;ed Fa|ther or his Grand-father were very pru|dent Per&s;ons; and that they had caus'd the exact Dimen&s;ions of this Hou&s;e to be taken, &s;uch as they now appear to be, if perhaps even they had not receiv'd the Model from their Predece&s;&s;ors; but in a Word, that he was re&s;olv'd to make no alteration.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Temper is al&s;o ob&s;ervable with &s;ome &s;ort of rigour in the exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="131" REF="70">
of the mo&s;t part of other Arts, which are practis'd even at this day in tho&s;e Parts after the &s;ame manner as under <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> altho' a thou&s;and con&s;i|derable Inventions have been found out &s;ince his Reign, and very many more Works are brought to Perfection, with a much le&s;s expence both of Mony and Time. I was &s;urpris'd to &s;ee Meat dre&s;s'd in many Places, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> makes it to be done by tho&s;e <HI>Germans,</HI> whom he knew only to be <HI>Barbarians:</HI> It is true indeed, that in others particularly with|in your Territories (my Lord) this ancient manner has been long &s;ince laid a&s;ide, and no other is follow'd but that which is whol&s;ome, neat and magnifi|cent. As for the Art of Phy&s;ick, I have a &s;omewhat greater knowledge of it, and have ob&s;erv'd that almo&s;t every where they make u&s;e of a great quan|tity of Drugs, and of that Method of Practice which prevail'd two thou&s;and years ago, as if we were <HI>Socrates</HI>'s or <HI>Epaminondas</HI>'s, without making any Reflection, that the diver&s;ity of Cli|mates, Aliments and Cu&s;toms, which
<PB N="132" REF="71">
alter the Bodies of Men and their Con|&s;titutions; produce new Symptoms and Circum&s;tances in Di&s;ea&s;es; and require new Remedies; or at lea&s;t a different Application of the old ones. There was &s;carce a Woman that did not cen|&s;ure me, for not pre&s;cribing a Do&s;e of <HI>Hellebore</HI> according to <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Form. Therefore without alledging any other Rea&s;on, altho' I might have done it; I reply'd, that People were in this Age much more &s;en&s;le&s;s and &s;illy than here|tofore, and that upon that account quite different Remedies were to be apply'd.</P>
<P>The Argumentation which might be made upon the&s;e Cu&s;toms wou'd be without doubt very tedious at lea&s;t too prolix for your Approbation (my Lord) and for my own Inclination; &s;o that I &s;hall confine my Di&s;cour&s;e to tho&s;e Matters that have the neare&s;t relation to both; and to tho&s;e that have not been as yet &s;o copiou&s;ly treated of as Pieces of Morality; on which Subject I meet with Books almo&s;t every where, as I am travelling.</P>

I might perhaps have taken there &s;ome &s;ingular Ob&s;ervations which wou'd have afforded &s;ome Satisfaction to your High|ne&s;s. Some of my Friends, who are almo&s;t always to be &s;uppos'd Men of Learning, and ever of good Repu|tation, conducted me within two Leagues of the City; here you may be pleas'd to take notice by the way,

<P>Undoubtedly derives its Etymology from <HI>Augu&s;ta.</HI> The adjacent Country is altogether full of the&s;e old Ruins; &s;o that we took much delight in going on foot about the di&s;tance of half an hours Journey from the principal Ca|&s;tle, where we perceiv'd in a Fore&s;t an Opening, which di&s;cover'd to us a vaulted Canal, with &s;ome con&s;i|derable remnant of Architecture. It is reported that it &s;erv'd as an A|queduct; for the Place which is &s;i|tuated on very high Ground &s;eems to demon&s;trate it; but others affirm that
<PB N="135" REF="72">
'twas a &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;age for Forces in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity; for 'twas as it were the Lodgment of the <HI>Germans,</HI> who Marching from the <HI>Black Forest,</HI> call'd <HI>Sylva Hercynia</HI> in the ancient Maps, endeavour'd to pa&s;s the <HI>Rhine</HI> there, to make their Incur&s;ions again&s;t the <HI>Romans.</HI> The principal Ca&s;tle, which is now known to the Inhabitants of the Country by the name of <HI>Das Scolfs,</HI> might al&s;o have been a part of the Town, and was one of tho&s;e three with which the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Rhine</HI> was fortify'd, which being lower in tho&s;e Parts than el&s;ewhere, may be &s;o much the more ea&s;ily travers'd. <HI>Ario|vi&s;tus</HI> e&s;cap'd thither after having been defeated by <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and &s;ome time after, <HI>Dru&s;us</HI> caus'd to be built in the Neigh|bourhood the Burgh of Guards, which &s;till even at this day bears the name of <HI>Bartemburg.</HI> The <HI>Salt-Tower</HI> which remains at <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> near the Bridge is built after the &s;ame manner, in&s;omuch that it may well be pre&s;um'd that tho&s;e three &s;orts of Ca&s;tles, were erected on purpo&s;e to di&s;cover the Enemies with greater fa|cility,
<PB N="136" REF="73">
and vigorou&s;ly to oppo&s;e their Pa&s;&s;age, on whatever &s;ide they &s;hou'd attempt it. However, the Place de|&s;erves all the pains that we took in the viewing of it; and it appears by the name of <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> that the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> were &s;ettl'd there, as in a Can|ton convenient for making head again&s;t the <HI>Germans;</HI> as al&s;o that they built this Fort of which appear &s;uch &s;tate|ly Ruins: Nay 'tis very probable that they founded a great City there, as well in regard that this name of <HI>Au|gu&s;ta</HI> was attributed by 'em only to Capital Cities, as <HI>Augu&s;ta Trinobantum, Augu&s;ta Trevirorum, Augu&s;ta Vindelico|rum,</HI> as by rea&s;on of the va&s;t number of Stones and other Materials which are found in the neighbouring Fields, none of 'em being to be &s;een in tho&s;e that are &s;uppos'd to have been &s;itu|ated without the compa&s;s of the Walls. The Ditches and Walls are in many Places &s;uch as they were a thou&s;and Years ago, and the manner of ce|menting the Stones is altogether in|imitable, at lea&s;t according to the
<PB N="137" REF="73">
Judgment of the mo&s;t skilful Ma&s;ons of the pre&s;ent Age, who acknowledge that they know nothing of the mat|ter, and that they are not able to comprehend it. But that which chief|ly excited our Curio&s;ity was, that the la&s;t Towers, of which we reckon'd up nine within the whole Circumfe|rence are all flank'd on the in&s;ide, contrary to the Rules of modern Ar|chitecture, which is infinitely more re|gular than the ancient: 'Tis true in|deed, that this method was more ad|ventageous in the Defence of tho&s;e Times; for the battering Rams which were the &s;tronge&s;t Machines, were apt to fly in pieces when run again&s;t the Concave of a Tower, whereas they might break it down down if it were Convex. One of our Company af|firm'd, that as in the Amphitheaters, and other <HI>Roman</HI> Buildings, there were Niches on the in&s;ide, in which wild Bea&s;ts were u&s;ually &s;hut up for the magnificence of their publick Shews, or the Puni&s;hment of Malefactors, &s;o the&s;e perhaps might have had the
<PB N="138" REF="74">
like u&s;e: However, 'tis difficult to make a right Conjecture, although I had an opportunity to confer with tho&s;e of the Country that &s;eem to be mo&s;t expert in the&s;e matters, and took delight in turning over the Draughts of 'em made by the Ingenious <HI>Amer|bachius.</HI></P>
<P>This Learned Man was of opinion that there was a Theatre compos'd of four Towers, every one of 'em be|ing &s;eparated by a Stair-ca&s;e; &s;o that the Spectators might re&s;ort thither at all times through the&s;e ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;ages, and place them&s;elves conveniently at their lei&s;ure. 'Tis probable that the Thought is true, at lea&s;t it &s;eem'd to me to be very fine. Therefore I have caus'd two Pro&s;pects of this Theatre to be engrav'd according to his Pro|ject and Memoires, with three ancient In&s;criptions.

&s;o many Women, and as a Woman to &s;o many Men. The other Ring &s;hews upon an Agate the figure of a Man leaning on a Column, and holding a kind of Sithe with one hand and an Almond with the other. The&s;e two particular Circum&s;tances induce me to &s;u&s;pect, that it may be that <HI>Atys,</HI> con|cerning whom the Fable makes &s;o ma|ny little My&s;teries, with re&s;pect to <HI>Cy|bele</HI> the Mother of the Gods. Between the&s;e two Rings there is a &s;mall Silver-Jewel in form of a Cre&s;cent; which was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential mark of the No|bility of tho&s;e old <HI>Romans,</HI> who caus'd them&s;elves to be &s;tyl'd <GAP DESC="foreign">, pre|tending even to be more ancient than the Moon, of which they wore this Repre&s;entation upon their Shoes and Stockings, whence the&s;e Marks al&s;o were call'd <HI>Lunulae.</HI> However, <HI>Zona|ras</HI> a&s;&s;ures us that this Figure was only e&s;teem'd by 'em, becau&s;e it expre&s;s'd after their manner the number 100. in Honour of the Hundred <HI>Patricians</HI> whom <HI>Romulus</HI> cho&s;e to con&s;titute his

<P>Again (My Lord) the Curio&s;ities to be &s;een in the City of <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> are exten|ded yet farther; for I am unwilling to let &s;lip an opportunity of entertaining Your Highne&s;s with the De&s;cription of another Repo&s;itory, which is very much talk'd of, upon account of its Fa|mous Founders, <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> and <HI>Amerba|chius,</HI> who&s;e Memory is highly ho|nour'd in that Countrey, which ac|knowledges them as the Re&s;torers of good Literature.

<P>This Repo&s;itory belongs to the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> by vertue of a Dona|tion, made by the Magi&s;trates of the City, who had purchas'd it with the &s;umm of a thou&s;and Crowns, of the Heirs of <HI>Amerbachius,</HI> the Legatee of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> who&s;e la&s;t Will and Te&s;ta|ment is as yet pre&s;erv'd, written with his own Hand.

<P>That, which alone would be &s;uffi|cient to procure the highe&s;t e&s;teem for this Repo&s;itory, is a &s;core of <HI>Holbein</HI>'s Originals, and among others that Pi|cture of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> Crucifi'd, for which a thou&s;and Ducats have been proffer'd.

<P>Give me leave (My Lord) to ac|quaint you with &s;omewhat concerning this <HI>Holbein:</HI> He was a Gallant Man, but &s;o extreamly nece&s;&s;itous, that &s;ome|times he had not wherewith to pay for his Dinner. In another Painting of the &s;ame Repo&s;itory, are drawn the Portrai|tures of his Wife and Children, who&s;e Apparel argues that they were very lit|tle better &s;upply'd with Nece&s;&s;aries. In a word, this Painting is a Trea&s;ure in Raggs.

I have &s;een in the Emperor's Repo&s;ito|ry, the Portraiture which he then made of this Famous Mini&s;ter of State. 'Tis re|ported, that not being able to call to mind the Name of the Amba&s;&s;ador, who had promis'd him his Protection, he ha&s;tily made a Draught according to the Idea which he had of his Lineaments, and luckily hit upon the whole Air of his Countenance; &s;o that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> immediately knew the

<P>It is certain that the&s;e Columns were carv'd in the time of the Emperour <HI>Alex|ander Severus,</HI> who was &s;lain near <HI>Mentz,</HI> by the order of <HI>Maximinus.</HI> I read this In|&s;cription upon one of 'em which is al|mo&s;t conformable in every thing to the

GA. AO. AB. AO. L. IIII. We have many other ancient In&s;criptions that relate to the&s;e, and which preci&s;ely determine the time.

It is probable that they were made to adorn their Tombs.</P>

what might well &s;erve as a Recom|pence for an extraordinary Merit and for much more con&s;iderable Services.

Indeed (My Lord) 'tis to partake of &s;omewhat of that exqui&s;it di&s;cerning Faculty, to know how to e&s;teem You, as I do: The Lu&s;tre of Grandeur is apt to dazzle common Eyes, but does not alwaies cau&s;e admi|ration in tho&s;e that have been well en|lighten'd: For neither that Highne&s;s of Birth, nor that Illu&s;trious Rank which Your Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s holds in the Empire, is capable of com|manding my Attention; &s;o many rare Endowments, &s;o many Divine Chara|cters imprinted on Your Noble Mind, are the only Charms that attract my Eyes: And this Pro&s;pect (My Lord) being alwaies fixt upon the mo&s;t He|roick Points of Antiquity, does not

<P>Your Highne&s;s is a Lover of Curio|&s;ity: How fortunate is the De&s;tiny! how happy is the Inclination! that a Prince &s;hou'd be induc'd to recreate him&s;elf &s;o plea&s;antly, and that that in|terval of Lei&s;ure which happens after the Tran&s;action of the mo&s;t important Affairs of State, &s;hou'd refine his Mind and augment its Vigour: For the&s;e &s;orts of Studies &s;erve to divert without amu&s;ing, and to employ without con|fining; alwaies retaining the Animal Spirits in a convenient Elevation with|out Di&s;turbance, and in Activity with|out any Fatigues. <HI>Curio&s;ity</HI> is the &s;e|cond Employment of Heroes, but more e&s;pecially that of Medals: The&s;e ever|la&s;ting Monuments, the&s;e little Sanctu|aries of the Memory of illu&s;trious Per|&s;onages;

the&s;e &s;acred Pledges of Ver|tue and Glory, &s;hew us the mo&s;t beau|tiful <HI>Idea</HI>'s of Antiquity, and di&s;cover 'em in their innate &s;implicity; in&s;o|much that they may be &s;een as they really are in their entire, Lu&s;tre and Perfection. They are properly &s;o ma|ny Pieces of Metal, animated as it were with a &s;ecret Life that does not take its ri&s;e from the Work-man; but pro|ceeds from I know not what Energy communicated from the incomparable Originals to their Images. This is not the Thing it &s;elf but the Quinte&s;&s;ence of it, neither is it a repre&s;entation of the Man but of the Demi-God. What delight is there (My Lord) in taking an E&s;timate of Your Qualities from tho&s;e great Examples which &s;eem as yet to have an influence over their Co|pies; to judge of them by You, and to ob&s;erve in them that which You find in Your&s;elf? To di&s;cover at fir&s;t &s;ight that all Ages have had their Heroes; and if &s;ome have been more renowned than others, 'tis becau&s;e the Occa&s;ions

were more opportune, and not in re|gard that their Endowments were not equally con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory &s;upplies us with a Relation of pa&s;t Occurrences and produces the particular circum&s;tances of Time, but the exact Truth and the nice&s;t Points are often wanting; or the manner of Expre&s;&s;ion does not furni&s;h us with a true <HI>Idea</HI> of the nature of the Things, as they appear in the Medal. This is not a proper Place to di&s;cour&s;e of every Particular that we know on this Sub|ject; but give me leave (My Lord) to declare, that I have not met with &s;o many Ingenious Lovers of Curio&s;ity el&s;ewhere as in <HI>Germany.</HI> This part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which has peopl'd all the others, has re&s;erv'd the be&s;t Trea&s;ures to it &s;elf; &s;o that it may well be af|firm'd that the re&s;t is only the Refu&s;e, and in the compari&s;on we &s;hall alwaies find a very great inequality. It is true indeed that there are &s;ome more fa|&s;hionable People, who&s;e Manners are more polite, and that wou'd have the
<PB N="218" REF="119">
advantage if they were &s;een only once or twice, &s;o that it &s;eems as if their &s;tudy'd Regularity &s;erv'd only to cover their Deformities, and perhaps Your Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s may have alrea|dy made this Reflection that even where no &s;olid Judgment is to be found, there appears a kind of modi&s;h Air or affected Gallantry, which dazzles the Eyes; at lea&s;t I have often ob&s;erv'd it in <HI>France.</HI> Again, where no &s;en&s;e of Honour nor real Genero&s;ity is to be met with, there is a &s;tudious affecta|tion of Civil Carriage, and a certain number of Cadences which &s;eem to &s;upply the defect, and to afford &s;ome &s;atisfaction but are really nothing le&s;s than Vertue. The <HI>Germans</HI> (My Lord) are more Grave and naturally endu'd with a great deal of Solidity: They are what they appear to be, but in re|gard that they do not appear at fir&s;t &s;ight altogether as they are, much Skill or at lea&s;t Application is requi&s;ite, to di&s;cover their Merit. Among them more e&s;pecially, good Nature and Cour|te&s;ie
<PB N="219" REF="119">
are in their natural Purity, and their Integrity of manners is altogether plain without any adulterate mixture or di&s;gui&s;e; which is every where the Character of a generous and free Tem|per, that cannot endure Affectation. The&s;e People are ready to perform whatever they undertake in good earne&s;t, without putting them&s;elves to any trouble to find out agreeable and &s;pecious manners of &s;etting about the Work; &s;o that a Man may &s;oon know when they bear good will toward him and when not: In &s;hort, to make u&s;e of the Terms of one of our Mini&s;ters of State: <HI>The Heart never appears there in Ma&s;carade, but Sincerity and Candour are the di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of the Coun|try. Tacitus</HI> had declar'd as much &s;ixteen hundred years ago, <HI>Nullos mor|talium armis aut fide ante</HI> Germanos <HI>e&s;&s;e.</HI> i. e. <HI>None ever &s;urpa&s;s'd the</HI> Germans <HI>in Valour and Fidelity.</HI></P>
<P>It is of no great importance to know, whether the Love of Curio&s;ity be com|mon among 'em, upon account of that
<PB N="220" REF="120">
natural Inclination they have for Truth, which is di&s;cover'd in it as it were in its &s;ource; or by rea&s;on of that &s;everity of Temper, which of all the Diverti&s;ements of the Mind, indu|ces 'em to make choice of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t profitable. However, 'tis cer|tain that Curio&s;ity is mo&s;t honour'd and &s;ought for by the be&s;t means in tho&s;e Parts, and I have every where found this Di&s;po&s;ition predominant. I &s;hall here &s;ubjoyn &s;ome Di&s;coveries which have been made by me in my la&s;t Journey, which Gratitude obliges me to con&s;ecrate to Your Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s, not being able at pre&s;ent to do any of greater moment for Your Service.</P>

If this Ob&s;ervation in Natural Philo&s;ophy be true, I am con|tent to referr my&s;elf to it; however, I very well remember that I was frozen and broil'd within a Moment without hearing any &s;uch Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>I left the Prodigy &s;oon after, in or|der to pa&s;s to <HI>Wirtemberg.</HI> The Hills thereabouts appear'd to me the fine&s;t and mo&s;t delightful in the World, be|ing altogether be&s;et with Vine-yard Plots and Corn-fields. The&s;e plentiful Crops by I know not what Di&s;po&s;ition caus'd by the &s;ituation of the Country, form a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Land-skip on all &s;ides, and a kind of Regularity which is extreamly &s;urprizing. The Inhabi|tants are very &s;ociable; perhaps, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="222" REF="121">
they are &s;upply'd with all man|ner of Conveniences. Thus a good ac|comodation at home naturally in&s;pires us with &s;entiments of Civility toward Strangers, but the&s;e People owe part of this Dome&s;tick happine&s;s to the Ge|nero&s;ity of their Prince, &s;o that one cannot ca&s;t an Eye upon 'em, without every were perceiving the marks of the Gentlene&s;s of his Government. Power and Authority are only exerted in Pro|tection and Di&s;cipline, and this is the only u&s;e that is there made of Sove|raignty; &s;o that I am apt to believe, nothing more is needful for the eter|nizing of his Memory. How difficult it is to u&s;e ab&s;olute Power with &s;o much moderation; and what a degree of Con|&s;tancy and Magnanimity (My Lord) is requi&s;ite to attempt nothing when one is in capacity of doing every thing, and to maintain the exerci&s;e of &s;o many Vertues amid&s;t all the bad Examples of the degenerate Age!

Their Tables are not only plen|fully furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, but even with Dainties: The Divi&s;ion of Time is &s;o well ma|nag'd,

<P>Altho' the extent of the Country be very large, yet Travellers are wont to ride po&s;te upon this Road in Chariots that run ince&s;&s;antly day and night; nei|ther is there any re&s;t to be taken but only to change the Hor&s;es. I was deliver'd from this Fatigue as &s;oon as I &s;aw <HI>Ber|lin,</HI> and every thing there appear'd &s;o beautiful to me, that I fancy'd there was a kind of opening in the Firma|ment, thro' which the Sun di&s;pens'd its mo&s;t benigne Influences to this Ter|ritory; neither are tho&s;e di&s;mal Solitu|des to be &s;een any longer, thro' which I had lately travell'd.

Heards of Deer and all &s;orts of Game; where he often diverts him&s;elf with Hunting, after &s;uch an extraordi|nary and plea&s;ant manner, as very few Per&s;ons are capable of apprehending it: I have even heard it reported, that he knows &s;o preci&s;ely the very moment when the wild Bore is ready to pa&s;s by, that he leaps upon his back as it were that of a Hor&s;e, and &s;itting a&s;tride &s;tabbs the Bea&s;t under him. This cir|cum&s;tance alone is &s;ufficient to &s;trike terrour into my Mind, and none can bear &s;uch Affection toward this Prince as I do, without fearing at lea&s;t the Mis-fortunes that may happen to his Noble Per&s;on, by expo&s;ing it to &s;o de&s;|perate an Adventure; Therefore I wou'd willingly give him the &s;ame Advice that <HI>Venus</HI> once did to her beloved <HI>A|donis:</HI>

<P>The Ca&s;tle in which his Electoral Highne&s;s re&s;ides, is a very ancient Fa|brick, and its Architecture &s;hews a kind of Maje&s;tick Air; but the modern Build|ings joyn'd to it are mo&s;t commodious. The Library is there plac'd in &s;o mag|nificent an Appartment, that I know none that &s;urpa&s;&s;es it in Beauty.

His Electoral Highne&s;s, who is entirely addicted to the admini&s;tration of the Government does not cea&s;e ne|verthele&s;s to allow &s;ome time for the compleating of this Collection. One wou'd &s;carce imagine how great a pro|gre&s;s he has made in the Work, only within his own Territories about <HI>We&s;el, Santen</HI> and <HI>Cleves,</HI> where a great quan|tity of the&s;e Medals has been found, and (what is mo&s;t important) even of tho&s;e that are very rare: That of <HI>Cornuficius</HI> is of this number, than which I never &s;aw a finer, but I &s;hall not here produce a particular De&s;cription of any of 'em: I have <HI>Memorandum's</HI> of tho&s;e that are mo&s;t valuable, and the&s;e Notes are as good luck wou'd have it, very con&s;i|derable; nay I have even delineated with a Pen tho&s;e that I judg'd to be &s;ingular: But they were &s;o numerous, that I was oblig'd another day to de&s;ire leave to employ my&s;elf in the &s;ame Work: I remember that I &s;pent the &s;econd time

five or &s;ix hours in the enjoyment of this agreeable Diver&s;ion, and that I very much enrich'd my Manu&s;cripts with tho&s;e Rarities; But altho' I had ob|&s;erv'd only the tenth part of 'em, yet I &s;hou'd have thought my Journey un|dertaken to very good purpo&s;e. The cu&s;tody of the&s;e choice Trea&s;ures is committed to M. <HI>Heimhach,</HI> who is a very great Admirer of 'em, and I doubt not but that he contributes, as far as his utmo&s;t Abilities will admit, to the &s;atisfaction of which the Elector his Ma&s;ter is de&s;irous in the&s;e Matters. In|deed this Prince is as exact in his &s;cru|tiny as is po&s;&s;ible, which is apparently the effect of the skill that he has ac|quir'd in &s;uch Curio&s;ities, and of the &s;agacity of his Judgment. He did me the Honour once to tell me, that he took great delight in this Employment, and that he wou'd &s;pend more time in it, as &s;oon as the more important Af|fairs of State cou'd allow him &s;o much lea&s;ure.

In this Conjuncture all <HI>Europe</HI> had re|gard to his Electoral Highne&s;s's Con|duct; it was al&s;o well known that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not hope for a more potent nor more ready Protector, and that the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he afforded 'em; was &s;ufficient to prevent, or at lea&s;t to deferr their Ruin. His memorable Actions perform'd not long &s;ince, have gain'd him &s;o great renown in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> that his very name alone is capable of &s;upporting the Intere&s;t of that Party which he &s;hall think fit to favour. In a word, he is a Prince of an admirable <HI>Genius,</HI> in&s;omuch that I never &s;aw any Man that had not a re&s;pect for his Per&s;on, and as for my own part, I mu&s;t acknowledge that my Affections toward him are mo&s;t cordial and &s;incere: But I ought al&s;o
<PB N="259" REF="139">
to acquaint Your Mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s that I am more particularly oblig'd to the &s;ame Prince for the kind Entertain|ment he afforded me at <HI>Berlin;</HI> for the Offers with which he was pleas'd to ho|nour me, and for his Genero&s;ity in conde&s;cending &s;o far as to tell me that he was de&s;irous to hold a Corre&s;pon|dence with me. I hope this Word may not be offen&s;ive to You (My Lord) His Electoral Highne&s;s only thought fit to lay his commands upon me&punc; in Matters relating to Curio&s;ity, ancient Hi&s;tory and Medals, and I have rea&s;on to take it very ill, if my Ene|mies &s;hou'd &s;eek an occa&s;ion from thence to create me new Troubles: As to tho&s;e that are pa&s;t, I doubt not but God, the King and Time, will do me Ju&s;tice, and indeed, it might have been already done; but 'tis my Duty to wait with Patience.</P>
<P>In the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI>'s Court at <HI>Berlin</HI> there is another illu&s;trious Per|&s;onage, as well vers'd in Curio&s;ity as

any that I know, I mean in the know|ledge of Medals, which we call by way of Excellency the mo&s;t delicate Curio&s;ity: He is a Privy Councellour to his Electoral Highne&s;s, who has as great a quantity of Medals in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion as is po&s;&s;ible for a private Per&s;on to procure: Some of 'em are &s;o well pre|&s;erv'd that it &s;ufficiently appears that they belong to a choice Collection which is of a very old &s;tanding. I was acquaint|ed with him in <HI>France</HI> above twenty years ago, and notwith&s;tanding his youth I ea&s;ily fore&s;aw his future Merit; nei|ther were my expectations deceiv'd in this particular, for his Learning has encreas'd with his Age, and I doubt whether there be any one be&s;ides my|&s;elf, that takes a greater delight in Me|dals than he: This Noble-man has &s;pent &s;ome years in <HI>Italy</HI> and has tra|vell'd thro' the whole Continent of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> and his profound skill induces me to believe, that he has ob&s;erv'd eve|ry thing that is nece&s;&s;ary to be taken

I know that he is a <HI>Lutheran</HI> and a zeal|ous Profe&s;&s;our of the Reformed Reli|gion, but that mo&s;t inviolable Friend|&s;hip which has been alwaies between us, and the Conformity of our Inclina|tions wou'd never &s;uffer us to differ tho' never &s;o little, about the Diver&s;i|ty of our Opinions.</P>
<P>The two young Princes (My Lord) will be one day great Patrons of Cu|rio&s;ity.

For their &s;everal Appartments are rather loaded than adorn'd with Books, Geographi|cal Maps, Chronological Tables, Globes, Sphaeres and Medals. In &s;hort, the&s;e are the In&s;truments that work Mira|cles by innocently maintaining Mag|nanimity during Pro&s;perity, and by &s;up|porting it even in Adver&s;ity. It is a general Maxime among the Prudent to be alwaies prepar'd for all manner of Events, as we learn from the Exam|ple of <HI>Hannibal.</HI> It is very probable that the&s;e Princes may alwaies &s;ee For|tune &s;miling and uncapable of doing 'em any injury; but 'tis a much more Royal Praerogative to have Vertue for their familiar Friend and Confident.

not di&s;continu'd but by a little Quarrel that aro&s;e between 'em upon account of Religion.

The <HI>Lutheran</HI> cou'd not en|dure to hear it; neither cou'd he for|bear telling him, that his Prayer was &s;uper&s;titious and impious; and, that, by pre&s;uming to attribute to Men &s;uch Prai|&s;es as were peculiar to the &s;upreme Dei|ty, Almighty God was entirely depriv'd of tho&s;e that were due to him alone. I had much adoe to put an end to this Altercation, and effected it only by oppo&s;ing that Article of the general Treaty of Peace, which Prohibits all &s;orts of Per&s;ons to di&s;turb the Publick Tranquillity under any pretence of Reli|gion what&s;oever.</P>

conver&s;ant about Hi&s;torical Rarities, but except &s;ome few Statues that were &s;et there for State and Magnificence ra|ther than out of Curio&s;ity, I cou'd not find any thing of that nature.

You are not ignorant of it (my Lord) <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great endur'd the&s;e fatigues; and <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was not exempted from 'em; &s;o that Your mo&s;t &s;erene Highne&s;s and the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Saltzburg</HI> are only free from &s;uch anxi|ous Di&s;tractions: A Cabinet of Medals; a little application to the viewing of &s;o many Hero's which they repre&s;ent; a word of Commendation for the Vertu|ous Princes; a grain of Salt let fall up|on the Tyrants; and admiration for all, might &s;erve (in my Opinion) as a Re|&s;torative for a &s;ublime Mind, too much taken up and tir'd with the admini&s;tra|tion of &s;ecular Affairs.

It is upon account that tho&s;e Per&s;ons who &s;eem to be be&s;t able to bear the charge that is nece&s;&s;ary for the making of &s;uch Collections, are lea&s;t of all in|clin'd
<PB N="291" REF="162">
to do it. The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Princes with whom I convers'd in <HI>Germany,</HI> are not much addicted to Curio&s;ity, at lea&s;t to that of Medals. I met with nothing remarkable at <HI>Mentz,</HI> altho' the Elector lately Deceas'd, was endu'd with all the excellent Qualities that can be imagin'd; but perhaps he was not acquainted with the&s;e kinds of Delights. The Grand Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, at pre&s;ent Vice-Roy of <HI>Hungary,</HI> is Magnificent in every thing; for 'tis apparent from the va&s;t Expences which he lays out in furni&s;hing his Table, in Hunting, and other noble Diverti&s;ements, that 'tis not the effect of Frugality that he has no Medals, and yet he is not &s;upply'd with any. He told me him&s;elf at <HI>Mergen|theim,</HI> where I went on purpo&s;e to wait upon His Highne&s;s, that if tho&s;e Princes cou'd be per&s;waded to &s;et a-part a hun|dred or two hundred Pi&s;toles for that u&s;e (which is a very incon&s;iderable Summ with re&s;pect to their Revenues) be&s;ides the benefit which they them&s;elves might reap from thence, it would turn very

much to the advantage of Po&s;terity, and the Republick of Learning. By this means their Cabinets wou'd be daily enrich'd with new Supplies, and many rare Pieces wou'd be ea&s;ily pre&s;erv'd, which are often melted down by the Gold&s;miths for want of Buyers, witne&s;s that half of a Golden Medal which re|mains in our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with the Por|traiture of <HI>Pe&s;cennius Niger.</HI> Tho&s;e Princes that delight in &s;uch Curio&s;ities wou'd take a very good cour&s;e (in my Mind) to enjoyn the Gold&s;miths in their re&s;pective Dominions, to give no|tice to the Magi&s;trates of every Town of all the occa&s;ions they &s;hall have both of buying and &s;elling Medals of Gold, Silver, and Copper. Be&s;ides, that by that means all opportunities of &s;tealing 'em might be taken away, it wou'd tend very much to the Princes advantage, without doing Injury to any Per&s;on whatever. The Gold&s;miths u&s;ually buy 'em by weighr, according to the value of the Metal, and for a &s;mall pro|fit that might be allow'd to the&s;e Arti|ficers,
<PB N="293" REF="163">
they wou'd be engag'd to melt none down. It is true indeed, that for a greater precaution it wou'd be requi|&s;ite to impo&s;e a Fine upon tho&s;e that &s;hou'd pre&s;ume to act contrary to the Royal Mandate, in melting down any without a Licence, or that &s;hou'd neg|lect to give timely notice of it to the Magi&s;trate, or &s;ome other Per&s;on au|thoriz'd by the Prince to exerci&s;e that Imployment in every City or Town. This Order (in my Opinion) wou'd take great effect in the principal Towns, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are &s;ituated upon a Road or publick Highway. Therefore it were to be wi&s;h'd, that the Arch-Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Saltzburg</HI> were inform'd of this Project, and that he wou'd vouch&s;afe to put it in execution; neither do I doubt but that in proce&s;s of time it wou'd evi|dently appear, that I have no le&s;s zeal for his Service than affection and re&s;pect for his Per&s;on.</P>

However, my Equipage gave 'em no occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;picion, in re|gard that I rode Po&s;t in a Chariot, ac|company'd only with a Friend on Hor&s;e|back; but perhaps the Character of my Nation made 'em &s;tand it out more ob|&s;tinately, and the re&s;pect that I ow'd to their Ma&s;ter oblig'd me to return. I had a fair Plea, that I was ju&s;t now come from <HI>Vienna,</HI> where His Imperial Ma|je&s;ty treated me with all manner of de|mon&s;trations of his Princely Favour, yet nothing was able to divert 'em from their Re&s;olution. <HI>Polybius</HI> wou'd never have imagin'd a <HI>French</HI>-man to be en|du'd with &s;o much moderation; and in|deed, he was &s;ometimes mi&s;taken, when he declar'd, <HI>Galli non dicam in pleri&s;que, &s;ed pror&s;us in omnibus actionibus &s;uis; ir&acirc; atque impetu, non con&s;ilio reguntur.

<P>Will your mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s vouch&s;afe to give me leave to relate two plea&s;ant Stories, which may &s;erve to give &s;ome Indication of the Manners of the&s;e People? Two <HI>Burgundians</HI> went on a certain time to buy Hor&s;es at <HI>Zu|rich,</HI> where in di&s;cour&s;ing with their Land-lord they gave it out that as the <HI>French</HI> had already made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Franche Comt&egrave;,</HI> they might perhaps arrive very &s;uddenly in <HI>Switzerland;</HI> and that they wou'd at lea&s;t oblige the Inhabitants to tie and untie their Shoes: In the mean while, a Neighbour being inform'd by the Inn|keeper of the Di&s;cour&s;e that happen'd between the&s;e Foreigners, went to meet 'em with a Sword by his &s;ide, and de|manded of 'em whether that which was reported to him were true: Whereupon
<PB N="312" REF="173">
the&s;e poor Wretches were extreamly af|frighted, yet cou'd not deny what they had &s;o openly declar'd: <HI>Come hither</HI> (&s;aid the <HI>Switzer</HI> to one of 'em) <HI>and un|tie this Shoe for me</HI> which was accor|dingly done: <HI>Then</HI> (continu'd he) <HI>go forward and bring thy Companion before me:</HI> As &s;oon as the other drew near, he was in like manner oblig'd to &s;ubmit, and to tie the &s;ame Shoe again. <HI>Learn then</HI> (reply'd the <HI>Switzer</HI> to both) <HI>that our Country-men are only induc'd to &s;erve by Friend&s;hip, and that they'll cau&s;e them|&s;elves to be obey'd whenever they are threaten'd.</HI> The other Story is much of the &s;ame Nature. A <HI>German</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thro' a Village of the Canton of <HI>Zurich,</HI> demanded which was the Road, of a young Pea&s;ant, whom he call'd accor|ding to his u&s;ual manner of drolling <HI>Kyemelker;</HI> the latter &s;et him in the right way, and immediately ran to his Father to acquaint him with the Nick|name which had been impos'd on him by the Traveller. The good Old-Man had no &s;ooner heard it, but he engages
<PB N="313" REF="173">
two of his Friends to accompany him, overtakes the <HI>German,</HI> and having en|joyn'd him to alight from his Hor&s;e, compell'd him to Milk a Cow for a con|&s;iderable time in &s;pite of his Teeth. <HI>Get thee gone then</HI> (&s;aid he after|ward) <HI>and boa&s;t if thou &s;halt think fit, that thou ha&s;t been in the Country of</HI> Keyemelkers, <HI>and that thou ha&s;t been no le&s;s a partaker of the &s;ame Employment than they.</HI></P>
<P>This may be &s;ufficient (my Lord) to &s;hew the <HI>Genius</HI> or natural Di&s;po&s;ition of the Nation, and I have even found an ancient In&s;cription, <HI>GENIO PAG.

of 'em. As for my part; I view'd 'em with great delight, and was even &s;ur|priz'd at the &s;atisfaction which they af|forded me.

<P>One cannot Travel very far in that Country without di&s;covering &s;ome rare Monuments of Antiquity; and indeed, I find many of 'em mention'd by Hi&s;tori|ans, but I cou'd wi&s;h they had been de|&s;crib'd after another manner; for Books are now &s;ubject to a much more critical Cen&s;ure than formerly.
