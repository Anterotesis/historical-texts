<HEAD>A RELATION OF the taking of the Hauen and fortre&s;&s;e of <HI>SELEVCIA</HI> called <HI>AGLIMAN</HI> in CARAMANIA, and of two Gene|rall Gallies and other &s;hips of the TVRKES.</HEAD>
<P>_THe great Duke <HI>Co&s;mo</HI> the &s;e|cond, heire of the valour and glorie of his mo&s;t princely Ance&s;tors as well as of their faire and flouri&s;hing States in <HI>Tu&s;canie,</HI> knowing in him&s;elfe hee had as great an inclination and as much obligation towards all high &amp; great attempts in generall, and particularly tho&s;e that were for the &s;ea, as he &s;aw him&s;elfe left with few oc|ca&s;ions and little meanes for the &s;ame, hauing beene preuented therein by the ambitious va|lour of his father <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> which &s;eemed to haue left after him nothing of any po&s;&s;ibilitie,
<PB N="2" REF="3">or &s;uch as was full of extreme difficulties: hee &s;eeing that (I &s;ay) fell not a crying with that <HI>Alexander</HI> which fir&s;t got him&s;elfe the name of <HI>Great,</HI> but rather the more mooued with lau|dable emulation, endeuoureth him&s;elfe daily to follow the victories of his father, and if po&s;&s;ible be, to rai&s;e them vp to the top of all perfection.</P>
<P>For this effect being re&s;olued to giue ouer tho&s;e flyings on the &s;ea, and vtterly tran&s;por|ted to the faire enterpri&s;es by land, after hee had made a mo&s;t curious fearch and examina|tion of the faire&s;t and harde&s;t among them, the fir&s;t he iudged worthy of him&s;elfe was this of <HI>Agliman,</HI> a fortre&s;&s;e of <HI>Caramania</HI> or <HI>Cilicia:</HI> a Country indeed which in old time hath had two mo&s;t famous Cities, <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> the Metropo|litan thereof and <HI>S. Pauls</HI> country, and <HI>Seleucia</HI> with the port and hauen thereof, now adaies called <HI>Agliman;</HI> from thence &s;ailed out armies for &s;ea the mo&s;t &s;trange and formidable that euer were heard of. Hi&s;torie tels vs, that the Pyrates which heeretofore there a&s;&s;embled, did &s;et out together &s;ometimes more than a thou&s;and great &s;hips, &s;o &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;h|ed,
<PB N="3" REF="3">that many had their &s;ailes of purple, the roapes and gables of gold, and the oares &s;et with &s;iluer, that by their inrodes and &s;courings they had &s;poiled and ruinated aboue foure hundred townes, and broken and marred all the trading and commerce thorowout the Mediterranean &s;ea, &s;o that proud <HI>Rome</HI> did ac|knowledge by them &s;he was not vnuincible as &s;he thought, and was forced then to &s;et out again&s;t them that great Nauie whereof <HI>Pom|peius</HI> the great was Admirall. This great Duke then a&s;pired to the &s;ame place on the which formerly <HI>Pompeius</HI> de&s;eigned his great enter|pri&s;e. And though this noble obiect was more than &s;ufficient to mooue his &s;pirit, yet the Chri&s;tian zeale and pietie was his chiefe&s;t and mo&s;t regarded motiue. For vpon the walles of the &s;ame fortre&s;&s;e were &s;et vp the heads of for|tie worthie and braue &s;ubiects of his, cruelly &s;laine when the &s;hip <HI>Prospera</HI> was lo&s;t by the &s;tubborne ignorance of the Captaine, which being drowned in the &s;ame did e&s;cape the ex|emplarie puni&s;hment he de&s;erued. This hor|rible trophey which the Turkes had thus ere|cted to their pride, &s;till kept a flea in the eare
<PB N="4" REF="4">(as the prouerbe is) of this great Duke, more than the victories of <HI>Miltiades</HI> in the head of <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI> And &s;uch a pitifull pawne mi&s;e|rably &s;taked vp there touched his heart to the quicke, more than euer was touched the heart of that famous The bane for the lo&s;&s;e of his &s;hield. The Agah of the place did fore&s;ee it very well, which many times endeuoured him&s;elfe &s;o to deale at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that the&s;e heads might be taken away, a&s;&s;uring that they could auaile to no other purpo&s;e, but as baits or &s;purres to the great Duke to enterpri&s;e the ruine of that place. Now then &s;uch hath been the enterpri&s;e which this yeere among&s;t many others giuen in charge (according to the cu|&s;tome) vnto the Admirall <HI>Ingherrammi</HI> did &s;eg|nalize &amp; ennoble the fame of the great Duke. The Gallies haue beene the&s;e &s;ix: the <HI>Capitana,</HI> the <HI>Padrona,</HI> the <HI>S. Maria Magdalena, S. France&s;e, S. Stephano, S. Giouanni:</HI> the which well furni&s;h|ed with victuals and all kinde of munitions for warre, manned al&s;o with &s;ix companies of &s;ouldiers, vnder the command vpon land of <HI>S</HI>^o^r. <HI>Iulio de Conty,</HI> called <HI>Montauto,</HI> with more than fortie Knights, and a good companie of
<PB N="5" REF="4">Nobles willing to venture with them, among&s;t the which was reckoned <HI>Don Pietro di Medicis.</HI> They did &s;et out the la&s;t day of March from the port of <HI>Ligorn,</HI> after they had deuoutly called vpon the diuine fauour vnder the hap|pie guidance and luckie pre&s;ence of the Dukes mo&s;t excellent greatne&s;&s;e their ma&s;ter. The &s;econd day of Aprill they arriued at <HI>Ciuita Vec|chia,</HI> and there found the Earle of <HI>Candale,</HI> Duke of <HI>Alluyn</HI> elde&s;t &s;onne to the Duke of <HI>E&s;pernon,</HI> a yoong Lord of &s;ome two and twenty yeeres of age, which burning with a generous flame in the loue of valour, and to be &s;egnalized by the worth of warres and deeds of armes, the only meane worthy of him&s;elfe, and practi&s;ed by his ance&s;tors, was exceeding de&s;irous to be one in this enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Which his Excellencie vnder&s;tanding, had commanded the Admirall to receiue him, and to v&s;e him according to the worth of his per|&s;on and hou&s;e whence hee was de&s;cended. Thus that yong Lord with fiftie others which accompanied him were &s;hipped and taken in, among&s;t which was <HI>Mons</HI>^r. <HI>de Cipierre, Mons</HI>^r. <HI>de Themines,</HI> the Barons of <HI>Momberault, de la Tour</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">and his brother, of <HI>Auenes, Deltour, Du Ple&s;sis, De la Motte Magnas, S. Cyre, Monplai&s;ir, de Lo&iuml;eres, de Vick, de la Boi&s;siere, de Verneug, de Villandreco.</HI> The tenth of Aprill they were at <HI>Me&s;sina,</HI> and the fourteenth departed thence, hauing well refre&s;hed them&s;elues and prouided all com|modities for their voiage. So they went run|ning the Archipelag &s;ea, without any worthie exploit, vntill the &s;ix and twentieth of the mo|neth, becau&s;e they could not bring happily to pa&s;&s;e another enterpri&s;e they had vpon <HI>Geron|da</HI> a little towne of <HI>Natolia,</HI> which is held to be the <HI>Gerunda</HI> of the Ancients. They landed there by the fauour of the &s;tilne&s;&s;e and dark|ne&s;&s;e of the night, but being entered there in due order, the next day morning they retur|ned thence without doing any thing, hauing found the place abandoned by the inhabitors, which many moneths afore had retreated them&s;elues in another place for feare of the like &s;urpri&s;es. They &s;et on and went forward their iourney Ea&s;tward for many daies, euen till the 13. of May, without atchieuing any deed, but the prize of three Changuis, which are &s;hips as bigge as Caramu&s;&s;als, and &s;ome
<PB N="7" REF="5">other &s;hippings of le&s;&s;e bignes. The morning of the fourteenth day finding them&s;elues neere <HI>Namur</HI> (a place &s;ome other times ruinated by the Gallies) they tooke it for a luckie &s;igne, and re&s;olued their enterpri&s;e vpon <HI>Agliman,</HI> and making on that way about the breake of day, they &s;pied a &s;hip &s;ome ten miles farre off. The Admirall knew full well what difference is betwixt &s;urprizing and hauing in cha&s;e. But becau&s;e that &s;hip was iudged to be a Galley for the forme of their &s;aile, and for the ob&s;cu|ritie which as yet was great, al&s;o becau&s;e they held for certaine, if that &s;hip &s;hould e&s;cape, it would giue warning to the whole Coa&s;t: a|gaine, that the &s;ituation of the Coa&s;t was &s;uch, that by rea&s;on thereof and of a little Iland not farre from thence named <HI>Papadula,</HI> the &s;hip could be well and ea&s;ily had in cha&s;e, clo&s;e and from the &s;ight of the fortre&s;&s;e, hee with the Coun&s;ell re&s;olued it &s;hould be cha&s;ed and made on. Thus making towards it and well pur&s;uing it was ouer reached and taken in le&s;&s;e than one houre. The &s;hip was of a rea|&s;onable bigne&s;&s;e of them which are called Grips, and was comming from the port and
<PB N="8" REF="6">fortre&s;&s;e of <HI>Agliman,</HI> and gaue intelligence that two daies before two Gallies of <HI>Cyprus</HI> were arriued there, the Captaine of <HI>Cerrigna</HI> of 25. Beys, and the Captaine of <HI>Paffo</HI> of 22. Beys, hauing broght the tribute which from thence is carried vpon Camels backes to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> The &s;umme could amount to &s;ome 200000. crownes. Be&s;ides that they &s;aid that the &s;ame fortre&s;&s;e was very well fenced and furni&s;hed, and well garded, and that about it there was more than 400. hor&s;es, and that but a little while after them there was to goe out one of the two Gallies, euen the &s;ame way, to come to the Iland <HI>Papadula</HI> to take a Ma&s;t for their &s;hip: for this cau&s;e the Admirall &s;ets forward with his fleet, and places it clo&s;e vnder the Iland in a place whence it could not be percei|ued, hauing &s;et his &s;cout or gard on ground. While&s;t they were thus waiting for the &s;ame, the returne was &s;uddenly made, and intelli|gence giuen, how the Gallie had made to|wards the &s;ea more than twentie miles, and in all ha&s;te with her Keeper or Con&s;erua was re|treating towards the Port, whence they con|ceiued that they had beene di&s;couered in gi|uing
<PB N="9" REF="6">their cha&s;e. Thereupon was made a great difficultie, whether they &s;hould goe forward in their enterpri&s;e, or el&s;e keepe them&s;elues for a better occa&s;ion; but all contrary opini|ons &s;et a&s;ide, it was re&s;olued to goe on and follow their de&s;igne. To this effect they made towards Port Caualier, being from <HI>Agliman</HI> &s;ome twelue miles di&s;tance, and arriuing there about &s;ix a clocke in the euening weighed an|cour hard by a very commodious lands end, and very &s;ecret, with a deliberation to goe out in the night in time that might be fit and &s;afe to land. Towards the end of the night they &s;ent out their long boat to &s;pie and di&s;couer. About two houres after or little more they re|turne and report that all the Country was vp in armes, the walles furni&s;hed with armed men, the hor&s;emen about the fortre&s;&s;e, and the two gallies with two other &s;hips within the Port. There on againe aro&s;e a great doubt if they &s;hould goe on, but notwith&s;tanding the manife&s;t apparence of &s;o great a danger, they had &s;uch confidence in their great courage, in the fortune of his princely Excellencie, and in the helpe and fauour of God, that they confir|med
<PB N="10" REF="7">againe their former re&s;olution. They therefore take their way about three a clocke in the night in deepe &s;ilence, and afore &s;ix in the morning their landing was made &s;ome mile and halfe from the Port. The Lord <HI>Iulio Montauto</HI> did land with the <HI>Comte Candale</HI> and &s;ome other choice men, few in number, to take a view of the Countrey, and though that they had &s;ome mile and halfe from them &s;pi|ed the Cauallerie or hor&s;e men of the enemie, yet neuer thele&s;&s;e in any ca&s;e he commanded to land, which was made without the di&s;tur|bance of any of the companies, hauing left only twenty &s;ouldiers for the keeping of each Gallie.</P>
<P>The fortre&s;&s;e of <HI>Agliman</HI> is &s;eated vpon a fine hillocke right oppo&s;ite to the &s;outh, ex|tending it &s;elfe from the top of the hillocke to the very &s;ea &s;hore, in figure ouall, or like an egge, the vppermo&s;t end whereof is on the top of the hillocke Northward, and the ne|thermo&s;t, at the hilles foot Southward. The wall is of very good &s;tone, the morter lime and &s;and, a fadome broad and fiue fadomes high, &s;o that a man may ea&s;ily walke vpon it.
<PB N="11" REF="7">In the third part of the inward &s;pace there is a cro&s;&s;ing wall, which cro&s;&s;es thorow and ioi|neth to the compa&s;&s;e of the wall from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t, &s;o that it diuides the place in two vnequall parts; the le&s;&s;e is as it were a reducti|on and retreat of the bigge&s;t. The going in is by one gate only place diu&s;t in the midde&s;t. In the girt of the walles there are fiue whole and full towers, and three halfe ones: the full ones are of a &s;quare forme fiue fadomes euery face; the halfe ones haue one face of the &s;ame big|ne&s;&s;e, and the other le&s;&s;e by halfe; their height exceedeth not that of the walles, except that which is in the point of the hillocke, which is eight foot higher: the fir&s;t full tower is alto|gether within the retiring place ea&s;tward; the other is al&s;o ea&s;tward, but halfe within and halfe without: within the halfe which is with|out fouthward is the fir&s;t gate; the &s;econd is in the inward face turned we&s;tward. The third tower is likewi&s;e halfe within and halfe with|out of the &s;ame &s;ide &s;ome 200. foot faire from the &s;econd: betweene them both is one of the meaue towers &s;ituate outwardly. The fourth is at the fore&s;aid top and point of the hill, and
<PB N="12" REF="8">makes as it were the corner by it &s;elfe, being all inward. At the going downe of the hill we&s;tward the two other halfe towers equally di&s;tant from the fifth tower, which is halfe without halfe within, and directly oppo&s;ite to the gates tower. There be fiue little &s;taires to goe vpon the wall; foure of them are of &s;tone within the great place, and the fifth is of wood within the retreat. In this place were more than 300. fighting men, the third part where|of had &s;hewed out them&s;elues the euening before. There was abundance of victuals and of all munition for warre, and many peeces of great ordinance. Without the place about a hundred hor&s;es went vp &amp; downe, and within the port there were two Gallies, a Carramu&s;&s;all and a Greeke Brigantin with &s;ome hundred and fiftie fighting men: they had retired with|in the fortre&s;&s;e all rowing people. The order of the fight thus was ordered and contriued by <HI>Montauto;</HI> For the principall gate and for that of the retiring place he appointed the companie of the &s;hip <HI>Cappitana,</HI> and that of <HI>S. Stephano</HI> with the petards vnder the command of the Earle of <HI>Candale</HI> head of that troope,
<PB N="13" REF="8">with order taken that all &s;hould obey him. The order being giuen, my Lord <HI>Candale</HI> con|ducting the point, &s;pied a corps de garde of footmen and hor&s;emen, whereof he gaue in|telligence to the Generall, &s;ending word that &s;till he would goe on towards the fort, to per|forme what he was bidden, and that if the Turkes &s;hould make towards him, he would pa&s;&s;e ouer their bellies, becau&s;e the countrey was very fauourable and good for the Infan|terie or footmen. The Generall prai&s;ed his re&s;olution, though many gaue aduice to re|treat within the Gallies. So the way was fol|lowed on, till they came within &s;ix &s;core paces of the place. Then was my Lo. <HI>Candales</HI> troope &s;aluted with great force of Muskets from the towne afore him, and from them of the Gal|lies behinde him, and from them of the hill at his &s;ide, and with &s;uch outcries and howlings of the Turkes, that many were a&s;toni&s;hed at it, and particularly the &s;ea men which carried the petards, &s;o that they let them fall and ran away. They were taken vp by the Baron <HI>Momberault</HI> and <HI>le Tiel</HI> a &s;ouldier of <HI>Languedoc.</HI> Being fifteene paces neere the place, my Lo.
<PB N="14" REF="9"><HI>Candale</HI> met eighteene or twenty Turkes &s;alli|ing out, which he &s;et vpon and &s;uddenly put to flight; but in &s;tead of pur&s;uing them, his aduice was to turne to the gate, to the which he ran amaine, thinking to haue found it yet open, but the Turkes with all diligence had &s;hut it againe. Therefore he commanded the Petart to be applied, which quickly was ready, but not without the hurt and death of many: among&s;t the which <HI>Dom Piedro de Medicis,</HI> which had done this honour to my Lo. <HI>Can|dale</HI> to ranke him&s;elfe in his troopes, was bea|ten downe vnder &s;uch a number of &s;tones flung at him, that he fell downe halfe dead. The Lords <HI>de Callonges, de Momberault, de la Tour, d'Auenes,</HI> and <HI>Deltour,</HI> had taken this charge, the one carrying the Petard, the other the hookes, another the Madrer, and all the re&s;t that was nece&s;&s;ary to make it go off more rea|dily. But as this &s;ernice was a doing, the Ser|geant Maior came and cried out vnto my Lo. <HI>Candale,</HI> that they were all vndone, and that there was comming right vpon them a troope of 300. Musketers: the&s;e were the two Beys, which were &s;allied out of the Gallies in the
<PB N="15" REF="9">port, through the naughty watching and gar|ding of two companies left by <HI>Comte Iulio,</HI> and by him appointed to with&s;tand them, and hinder their comming foorth: &s;o that my Lo. <HI>Candale</HI> was forced to take &s;ome part of his own men and make head again&s;t that troope, leauing the other part for the Petard. But when the Beys &s;aw him ready comming to receiue them, and almo&s;t at handie blowes, they turned away towards the mountaine, yet &s;till &s;hooting and playing with their Muskets vpon him. My Lo. <HI>Candale</HI> would not follow them, and thought it was more fit and conue|nient to goe backe to his Petard, which in|&s;tantly did play on and made &s;uch a breach, that three men a brea&s;t might ea&s;ily enter.</P>
<P>Now for the tower aboue, the company of hor&s;emen, commanded by Lieutenant <HI>Len Zour,</HI> &amp; the company of the galley of <HI>S. Maria Magdalena</HI> with two Ladders were appointed.</P>
<P>For the retreating place towards the fourth, the company of the galley <HI>Padrona</HI> with a Ladder.</P>
<P>And to the gallies and &s;hips in the hauen, the company of the galley of <HI>S. Giouanni.</HI></P>
<PB N="16" REF="10">
<P>In that order they marched, conducted by <HI>S</HI>^o^r. <HI>Iulio Montauto,</HI> and by Captaine <HI>Alexander di Taranta</HI> Sergeant Maior, the Cauallerie of the enemie being &s;till a&s;ide of them on the top of the hill. They were no &s;ooner within a cali|uer &s;hot of the walles, but they were &s;aluted from thence with pellets and arrowes liuely and thicke: being come neerer, there flew a &s;howre of huge &s;tones vpon their heads. But all this notwith&s;tanding, their Petard plaied on very happily, as we haue &s;aid, and the &s;e|cond gate being opened, the Earle of <HI>Candale</HI> with his troope entered the fir&s;t with a mar|uellous furie: and no &s;ooner were they in, but that they ran to the retreating place to applie there another Petard; which was done, and the effect thereof very braue and &s;eruiceable. The Turkes as well at the fir&s;t as at the &s;econd Petard were &s;o aba&s;hed and a&s;tonied, that they knew not what to doe, but run away and flie to the walles, towers, and fortifications or barricadoes which they had made in the &s;treets: our men pur&s;ue them liuely and pre&s;&s;e vpon them on all &s;ides. The two ladders be|low were planted at the &s;ame time that the
<PB N="17" REF="10">fir&s;t Petard plaied on them. But one which was of the &s;outh &s;ide being broken, not with|out &s;ome hurt to tho&s;e that were vpon it, all of them ran to helpe the other of the &s;outh &s;ide, where the Cauallerie of the enemie was charging them very fiercely; by the meanes of which &s;uccour, they forced the hor&s;emen to breake away, and tooke their flagge or Cor|net, and hauing planted the ladder again&s;t the walles, a great many of our men got vp, and then diuided them&s;elues into two companies to charge both the one and the other &s;ide, opening by force of armes that narrow way, and went directly to the towers, where they gaue many furious a&s;&s;aults. The &s;quadron of hor&s;emen and the company of <HI>S. Maria Mag|dalena</HI> hauing had a longer and harder way to make, could not arriue before the effect of the Petards; at the noi&s;e and terrour of the which the Turkes hauing retired into the higher place, they of the &s;quadron found a maruel|lous re&s;i&s;tance afore, and were laid on behind very fiercely by the Cauallerie or hor&s;emen of the enemie, and by the foot which &s;allied from the Gallies in the port: by rea&s;on where|of
<PB N="18" REF="11">the Lieutenant after hee had done as much as a worthy hone&s;t man could doe, with his braue Caualieroes, &s;eeing that he could ad|uance nothing, by the aduice of the wi&s;e&s;t, he re&s;olued to goe thence and make towards the place where it &s;hould be more nece&s;&s;arie. But as he was &s;taying the la&s;t in that retreat (like a valiant Captaine, as al&s;o he had beene the fir&s;t at the comming on) he was &s;hot tho|row with two musket &s;hots, and fell dead on the place.</P>
<P>The company of <HI>S. Giouanni</HI> ma&s;tered at an in&s;tant the two Gallies in the port, and our Admirall at the &s;igne giuen came with his Gallies to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them in the port without any difficultie, and touched not the two other &s;hips, becau&s;e they were of Greece. The fighting and skirmi&s;hing did continue &s;till with all the towers and barricadoes of the place, and the combat grew more and more eager from both &s;ides, ours being kindled with a braue courage and held vp with a wonder|full con&s;tancie of re&s;olution, and the Turkes hauing the aduantage both of the &s;tronger place and of their de&s;paire. Finally, God the
