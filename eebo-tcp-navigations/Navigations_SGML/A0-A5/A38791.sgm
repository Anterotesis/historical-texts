<HEAD>TO THE

<P>WHen I fir&s;t chanced upon
this &s;evere piece, and
read it in the Language it was &s;ent
me, I was &s;o much concern'd for the
honour of our Country, that it was
my re&s;olution to &s;uppre&s;s the Pub|lication
of our &s;hame, as conceiving
it an Act of great Inhumanity;
But upon &s;econd, and more impar|tial
Thoughts, I have been tempted
to make it &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
give it Liberty, not to reproach,
but to in&s;truct our Nation, remem|bring
what the Wi&s;e-Man hath
&s;aid, <HI>Open rebuke is better than
<PB REF="4">
&s;ecret Love.</HI> Prov. 27. 5. The
truth is, I cannot &s;ay but the par|ticulars,
are mo&s;t of them, very
home; and which we may no way
evade, without acknowledging, at
lea&s;t, that the Gentleman (whoever
he were) made notable u&s;e of his
time, but be&s;t of all, by &s;etting
upon an effectual redre&s;s of what is
ami&s;s. And though I doubt not,
but one might ea&s;ily retort in as ma|ny
in&s;tances, upon defects as great
(if not greater) of that Nation;
(for he that finds fault, had need
be perfect) yet were it then fitte&s;t
to do it, and to revenge this Cha|ritable
Office, when we &s;hall have
fir&s;t reformed our &s;elves.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU Command me to give
you a Minute account of
what I ob&s;erved, and how I
pa&s;&s;ed that little time which
I lately &s;pent in <HI>England;</HI> a Country,
who&s;e <HI>Character</HI> you &s;o greatly de&s;ire
to be informed of, in a Conjuncture
(as you rightly deduce) of &s;trange Vi|ci&s;&s;itude,
and indeed they are a Peo|ple
of all the World mo&s;t fond of alte|rations;
And to whom, My <HI>Lord,</HI>
&s;hould I more readily &s;ubmit? Fir&s;t,
encourag'd to make this excur&s;ion by
<PB N="2" REF="6">
your Lord&s;hip, who had formerly be|held,
and &s;o much admir'd the Splen|dor
and Magnificence of this <HI>Court,</HI>
and <HI>Kingdom</HI> in its greate&s;t <HI>Acme</HI> and
Lu&s;tre. But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> I cannot
imagine, that you &s;hould e&s;teem me
either of Years, or Capacity to in|form
<HI>You,</HI> who&s;e Judgment is &s;o Ma|ture,
and Corre&s;pondence &s;o univer|&s;al,
as that there is nothing which
can e&s;cape your Cognizance, not only
in that <HI>I&s;land,</HI> but in all the VVorld
be&s;ides. But &s;ince you oblige me not
to dip into the Tran&s;actions of State,
the effects of Providence, Time, and
other Notices of a Superiour Orb;
and in which you cannot be in&s;tructed
by &s;o weak an in&s;trument as your
Servant; and demand only the little
<HI>Remarks</HI> of my ha&s;ty, and de&s;ultory
<HI>Peregrination;</HI> though I cannot pre|tend
to improve your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s
Knowledge, yet I may hope to give
it diver&s;ion, and an <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> of my Obe|dience.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be avowed that <HI>England</HI> is
a Sweet, and Fertil Country.</P>
<P>Terra potens armis, atque ubere gleba.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
That the Fields,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cripti|on of the Country.</NOTE> the Hills, and the Val|lies
are perpetually clad with a glori|ous,
and agreeable Verdure; that her
Provi&s;ions are plentiful; her Staples
important; and her intere&s;t very con|&s;iderable;
not omitting the mo&s;t Beau|tiful
<HI>Ladies,</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid, of the
VVorld,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beauty of the Ladies</NOTE> but for a ju&s;t re&s;pect due to
the Illu&s;trious <HI>Circles</HI> of our <HI>Court,</HI>
where the Beauties of Conver&s;ation,
&s;o far tran&s;cend the tinctures of Lillies
and Ro&s;es. But the&s;e, My <HI>Lord,</HI> are
not the <HI>Memoirs</HI> which you demand;
I will therefore ha&s;ten to my <HI>Po&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>After a &s;hort Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Calais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rudene&s;s of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI></NOTE>
we came on &s;hore at <HI>Dover,</HI> where
the People of the Town entertain'd us
with &s;uch &s;u&s;picious and forbidding
Countenances, whi&s;pering, and &s;tiff
Po&s;tures, that I &s;hould never have
believed &s;o great a difference in the Ad|dre&s;&s;es
of two Nations, could have
been produced by &s;o &s;hort a trajecti|on,
and in a Port continually accu|&s;tom'd
to the Faces of Strangers, had
not the contrary humours of our con|tiguous
Neighbours, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
made it po&s;&s;ible, in &s;o many plea&s;ant
<PB N="4" REF="7">
in&s;tances. But I was amazed, when
we had taken <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> and &s;carce out of
the <HI>Village,</HI> at the Acclamations of the
<HI>Boys,</HI> running after, and affrighting
our Hor&s;es, hooting, and crying
out, <HI>French Dogs, French Dogs, a
Mon&s;ieur, Mon&s;ieur!</HI> By a particular
expre&s;&s;ion of Welcome, which other
People would interpret Deri&s;ion; But
in this Triumph (though &s;omewhat
late e'er we &s;et out of <HI>Dover</HI>) we at|tain'd
as far as <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> the fir&s;t night,
where, how new a thing it appear|ed
to me, to &s;ee my confident <HI>Ho&s;t</HI>
&s;et him down cheek by joul by me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confi|dence of the Inn-Keepers.</NOTE>
belching, and puffing <HI>Tobacco</HI> in
my Face, you may ea&s;ily imagine,
till I afterwards found it to be the u|&s;ual
&s;tile of this Country; and that
the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who lodge at their
<HI>Inns,</HI> entertain them&s;elves in their
Company, and are much pleas'd with
their impertinences: Arriv'd at the
<HI>Metropolis</HI> of civility, <HI>London,</HI> we put
our &s;elves in <HI>Coach,</HI> with &s;ome Per&s;ons
of Quality, who came to conduct us
to our Lodging; but neither was this
pa&s;&s;age without honours done to us,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
the Kennel dirt, and roots being fa|vours
which were frequently ca&s;t at
us by the Children, and Apprentices
without reproof; Civilities, that in
<HI>Paris,</HI> a <HI>Gentleman</HI> as &s;eldom meets
withal, as with the conte&s;ts of <HI>Car-Men,</HI>
who in this Town domineer in
the Streets, o'er-throw the <HI>Hell-Carts</HI>
(for &s;o they name the <HI>Coaches</HI>)
Cur&s;ing, and reviling at the <HI>Nobles:</HI>
You would imagine your&s;elf among&s;t
a <HI>Legion</HI> of <HI>Devils,</HI> and in the &s;uburb of
<HI>Hell.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ill manners of the Commo|nalty at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> I have greatly wondered at the
remi&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> and the
temper of the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and that the
<HI>Citizens,</HI> who &s;ub&s;i&s;t only upon them,
&s;hould permit &s;o great a di&s;order, rather
joining in the affronts, than at all cha|&s;tizing
the Inhumanity. But, the&s;e are
the natural effects of Parity, popular
Libertini&s;m, and In&s;ulary Manners.</P>
<P>I find, as you told me, My <HI>Lord,
London</HI> to be a Town &s;o nobly Scitu|ated,
and upon &s;uch a River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cripti|on of <HI>Lon|don.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>Europe</HI>
certainly &s;hews not one more u&s;eful
and agreeable; Their <HI>Fountains,</HI> which
are the Pride and Grace of our Streets,
and plentifully &s;upplyed in this <HI>City,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
are here immur'd, to &s;ecure the Wa|ters
from, I know not what, impuri|ties:
But certainly, it do's greatly de|tract
from the beauty of the <HI>Carfours,</HI>
and intercepts the view.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the piece of <HI>Modern Archi|tecture,</HI>
I have never ob&s;erv'd above
two, which were Remarkable in this
va&s;t, <HI>City.</HI> The Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s,
and the Banqueting-Hou&s;e at <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
of which I remember to have
heard your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> &s;peak: But you
would be amaz'd at the <HI>genius</HI> of
the&s;e People, that not much above for|ty
Years ago &s;hould &s;uffer this goodly
and venerable Fabrick, to be built a|bout
and converted into raskally
<HI>Ware-Hou&s;es,</HI> and &s;o &s;ordidly ob&s;cur'd
and defac'd, that an argument of
great Avarice, Malice, Meanne&s;s, and
deformity of Mind, cannot po&s;&s;ibly
be expre&s;&s;ed: Nothing here of Or|nament,
nothing of Magnificence, (on|ly
a heavy piece of Architecture;) no
publick and honourable Works, &s;uch
as render our <HI>Paris,</HI> and other <HI>Cities</HI>
of <HI>France,</HI> renowned, and vi&s;ited by
all the World; emulating even <HI>Italy</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
her&s;elf, for her <HI>Palaces,</HI> uniform and
con&s;picuous Structures: I a&s;&s;ure your
<HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> is the &s;ole &s;pot
in all the World, where among <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI>
their <HI>Churches</HI> have been made
Jakes, and Stables, Markets and
Tipling-Hou&s;es; and where there
were more need of <HI>Scorpions,</HI> than
<HI>Thongs,</HI> to drive out the <HI>Publicans</HI>
and <HI>Money-Changers:</HI> In &s;um, where
the&s;e <HI>excellent</HI> u&s;es, are pretended to
be the Marks of Piety and Reforma|tion.
I had &s;ometimes the curio&s;ity
to vi&s;it the &s;everal <HI>Wor&s;hips</HI> of the&s;e
<HI>Equivocal Chri&s;tians,</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts:</HI>
But I extreamly wondred to find
tho&s;e whom they call <HI>Presbyterians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cripti|on of the Prebyte|rians.</NOTE>
and that would imitate us of the <HI>Re|ligion</HI>
in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> to have
their <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> &s;o confu&s;ed and diffe|rent.
In this <HI>remark,</HI> My Lord, to
be &s;omewhat more particular, you
will not be di&s;pleas'd; becau&s;e it
was a thing you &s;o much recommend|ed
to my e&s;pecial Notice. <HI>Form,</HI>
they ob&s;erve none; They pray and
read without method, and indeed,
without Reverence or Devotion; I
<PB N="8" REF="9">
have beheld a whole Congregation
&s;it on their&mdash;with their Hats on, at
the reading of the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> and yet
bare-headed when they &s;ing them,
in divers places they read not the
<HI>Scriptures</HI> at all; but up into the <HI>Pul|pit,</HI>
where they make an in&s;ipid, te|dious
and immethodical <HI>Prayer,</HI> in
Phra&s;es, and a tone &s;o affected and
my&s;terious, that they give it the
name of <HI>Canting,</HI> a term by which
they do u&s;ually expre&s;s the <HI>Gibbri&s;h</HI>
of Beggars and Vagabonds; after
which, there follows the <HI>Sermon,</HI>
con&s;i&s;ting (like their Prayers) of
<HI>Speculative</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;tracted</HI> Notions,
and things, which, nor the People,
nor them&s;elves, well under&s;tand: But
the&s;e they extend to an extraordinary
length, and <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> repetitions;
'till almo&s;t they &s;leep; I am &s;ure, 'till
their Auditors do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> u&s;es no Habit of
di&s;tinction, or gravity, but &s;teps up
in <HI>querpo;</HI> and when he lays by his
<HI>Cloak</HI> (as I have ob&s;erved &s;ome of
them) he has the action rather of a
<HI>Thra&s;her,</HI> than a <HI>Divine;</HI> this they
<PB N="9" REF="9">
call <HI>taking pains,</HI> and indeed it is &s;o, to
tho&s;e that hear them: But thus they
have now encouraged every pert <HI>Me|chanick</HI>
to invade, affront and out|preach
them; and having cancel'd
all manner of decency, pro&s;tituted both
their Per&s;ons and Function to u&s;urpa|tion,
penury and deri&s;ion. You may
well imagine by the manners of the
People, and their prodigious Opinions,
that there is no <HI>Catechi&s;ms,</HI> nor <HI>Sacra|ments</HI>
duly Admini&s;tred: <HI>The Religion
of</HI> England <HI>is Preaching, and &s;itting &s;till
on Sundays.</HI> How they Baptize I
know not, becau&s;e the Congregation
is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and they agree in no
form; and for the other <HI>Sacraments,</HI>
no Man gives, or receives alike: Such
of their Churches as I have frequented,
were damned up with <HI>Pues,</HI> every
three or four of the Inhabitants, &s;it|ting
in narrow <HI>Pounds</HI> or <HI>Pulpits,</HI> by
them&s;elves; for they are all turn'd
<HI>Preachers</HI> now, In &s;hort, there is
nothing more unlike to our reformed
Churches in <HI>France</HI> and I think in all
<HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ide; the apprehen&s;ion of
<HI>Popery,</HI> or fondne&s;s to their own ima|ginations,
<PB N="10" REF="10">
having carry'd them &s;o far
to the other extream, that they have
now lo&s;t all Moderation, and Deco|rum;
And I have been herein, My
Lord, the more indu&s;trious to inform
my &s;elf of each particular; becau&s;e it
&s;eems yet to be as publick as the <HI>Reli|gion</HI>
of the State. Some of their own
party, I have heard deplore this con|fu&s;ion,
but certainly, they them&s;elves
gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to the&s;e Mon|&s;trous
Liberties, by a Rigid, and Un|charitable
Di&s;cipline; primarily (it
&s;eems) introduced by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
&s;o refined upon by the&s;e, as there are
few or none that will &s;ubmit to the
Tyranny; but every one takes his
own cour&s;e, and has protection for
it. Some well natur'd abu&s;ed Men I
have met withal among them; but,
if I mi&s;take not, for the greater Ingre|dient,
Ambitious, Ignorant, Over|weening,
Sower, and Uncharitable,
<HI>ne quid a&s;perius,</HI> combining with the
intere&s;t of the times, and, who to
render them&s;elves powerful, have in
compliances with the Spirital Pride of
the <HI>Mechanicks</HI> and Corporations, con|niv'd
<PB N="11" REF="10">
at tho&s;e many, and prodigious
<HI>Schi&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> which are now
&s;pawn'd under themin &s;uch numbers,
as give terrour to the State. I omit
to tell your Lord&s;hip that few take
Notice of the <HI>Lord</HI>'s-Prayer; it is e|&s;teemed
a kind of weakne&s;s to u&s;e it,
but the <HI>Creed</HI> and the <HI>Decalogue</HI> are
not once heard of in their Congrega|tions;
This is Milk for <HI>Babes,</HI> and
the&s;e are all <HI>Giants.</HI> They do fre|quently
Solemnize their late <HI>National</HI>
deliverances, and &s;ome days of <HI>Chri|&s;tian
Blood&s;hed,</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible exact|ne&s;s.
But they think it gro&s;s <HI>Idolatry</HI>
to join with the whole <HI>Chri&s;tian
Church</HI> of all Profe&s;&s;ions under Hea|ven,
in the <HI>Anniver&s;aries</HI> of our B.
<HI>Saviours Incarnation, Pa&s;&s;ion, Re&s;ur|rection,</HI>
and de&s;cent of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI>
Spiritual, Eternal, and never to be
forgotten Mercies. Would your
<HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> believe that this madne&s;s
&s;hould advance &s;o far, as to di&s;turb
the <HI>French-Church</HI> there, which you
know, does in all places ob&s;erve tho&s;e
&s;ignal Deliverances and Ble&s;&s;ings,
both by <HI>Preaching, Prayer, Sacra|ments</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
and Exhortations, appo&s;ite to
to the Occa&s;ion; What think you
will be the i&s;&s;ue of this goodly Refor|mation?
I could tell you more of the
My&s;terious <HI>Cla&s;&s;is;</HI> their ridiculous,
in&s;idiary, and pre&s;umptuous Que&s;ti|ons;
their unheard of Animo&s;ities
again&s;t their Brethern of the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>England,</HI> &s;uffering them&s;elves to be ra|ther
torn in &s;under by the <HI>Sectaries,
Demotrius</HI> and the <HI>Crafts-Men,</HI> whil&s;t
they contend about trifles and meer

<P>Concerning the <HI>Independents,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cripti- of the In|depen|dents, Auabap|ti&s;ts, Quakers, &amp;c.</NOTE> all I
can learn is; They are a refined, and
Apo&s;tate &s;ort of <HI>Presbyters;</HI> or, rather
&s;uch as renounces all Ordination, as who
having Preached promi&s;cuou&s;ly to the
People, and cunningly en&s;nared a Se|lect
number of Rich, and ignorant
Pro&s;elytes, &s;eparate them&s;elves into

There is nothing does
more re&s;emble this <HI>Sect,</HI> than our
Rom. <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> &s;ent out <HI>in partibus

Hou&s;e in the <HI>Country,</HI> where there was
<PB N="18" REF="14">
much Company and Fea&s;ting. I
chanced to come at Dinner-Time, and
after the Cloth was taken away (as
the manner is) they fell to their lauda|ble
Exerci&s;e: But I unacquainted
then with their Cu&s;tom, was lead up
into a <HI>With-Drawing-Room,</HI> where
I had the Permi&s;&s;ion (with a Noble

to Entertain his Friends below: But
you may imagine how &s;trangely I
was a&s;toni&s;hed; to &s;ee within an hour
after, one of the Company that had Di|ned
there, entering into the Room all
bloody,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the quarelling among the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> and di&s;order'd, to fetch a
Sword which lay in one of the Win|dows,
and three or four of his Com|panions,

dragging him by the Hair, till in this

into a Carpet, upon which &s;tood a

<HI>Ladies</HI> from &s;uffering in the
tumult; but at la&s;t we prevailed,
and brought them to terms, the quar|rel
concerning an <HI>Health</HI> only, which
one of them would have &s;hifted. I
don't remember, My <HI>Lord,</HI> ever to

that they kept at &s;uch a &s;urly di&s;tance

&s;hould produce them&s;elves, and give

a particular, which I have heard you
often complain of, and which we do
frequently take notice of, at their
coming abroad into our Country;
where for want of addre&s;s, and fit

that there was much ado to pre|&s;erve
the Peace, and as I heard, it was
the next Day, the product of a Quar|rel,
and a <HI>Duel.</HI></P>
<P>I did frequently in the Spring, Ac|company
My Lord <HI>N.</HI> into a Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Hide Park.</NOTE>
near the Town, which they call <HI>Hide-Park;</HI>
the place not unple&s;ant, and
which they u&s;e, as our <HI>Cour&s;e;</HI> but
not with that Order, Equipage, and
Splendor; there being an A&s;&s;embly
of &s;uch wretched <HI>Jades,</HI> and <HI>Hackney-Coaches,</HI>
as quite takes away the re|&s;emblance.</P>
<P>The next place to be remembred
is the <HI>Spring-Garden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Spring-Garden.</NOTE> &s;o called, and in
order to the <HI>Park,</HI> as our <HI>Thuilleries</HI>
is to the <HI>Cour&s;e,</HI> the inclo&s;ure not di&s;|agreeable,
for the &s;olemne&s;s of the
<HI>Grove,</HI> the warbling of the Birds;
but the Company Walk in it at &s;uch
a rate, as you would think all the
<HI>Ladies</HI> were &s;o many <HI>Atalanta</HI>'s, con|tending
<PB N="30" REF="20">
with their <HI>Wooers;</HI> and my
<HI>Lord,</HI> there was no appearance, that
I &s;hould prove the <HI>Hippomenes,</HI> who
could with very much ado, keep pace
with them: But as fa&s;t as they run;
they &s;tay there &s;o long, as if they
wanted not time to fini&s;h the <HI>Race;</HI>
for it is u&s;ual <HI>here</HI> to find &s;ome of the
Young Company till midnight; and
the Thickets of the <HI>Garden</HI> &s;eem to be
contrived to all Advantages of <HI>Gallan|try,</HI>
after they have been refre&s;hed
with the <HI>Collation,</HI> which is here &s;el|dom
omitted, at a certain <HI>Cabaret</HI> in the
middle of this <HI>Paradi&s;e;</HI> where the
forbidden Fruits are certain trifling
<HI>Tarts, Neats-Tongues, Salacious-Meats,</HI>
and bad <HI>Rheni&s;h;</HI> for which the <HI>Gal|lants</HI>
pay &s;auce, as indeed they do at
all &s;uch Hou&s;es throughout <HI>England;</HI>
for they think it is a piece of Frugali|ty
beneath them, to Bargain, or Ac|compt,
for what they Eat in any place,
however unrea&s;onably impo&s;ed upon;
But thus, tho&s;e mean Fellows are (as
I told your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>) inriched; Beg|ger,
and in&s;ult over the <HI>Gentlemen.</HI>
I am a&s;&s;ur'd that this particular <HI>Ho&s;t.</HI>

Has purcha&s;ed, within few Years,
5000 <HI>Livers</HI> of annual rent; and well
he may? at the rates the&s;e <HI>Prodigials</HI>

But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> it is now late,
and time to quit this <HI>Garden,</HI> and to
tell you, that I think there is not a
more Illu&s;trious &s;ight in the World,
than to meet the <HI>Divinities</HI> of our
<HI>Court,</HI> marching up the long Walk in
the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> where the pace is &s;o
&s;tay'd and grave, the encounters &s;o
regular and decent; and where tho&s;e
who feed their Eyes with their Beau|ties,
and their Ears with the Charm|ing
<HI>Accent</HI> of their Di&s;cour&s;e, and
Voices, need not tho&s;e refre&s;hments
of the other <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> finding them
all to be &s;o taken up with the&s;e.</P>
<P>I was curious before my return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where they plead as at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> and
when I had Conquer'd &s;ome difficul|ties

vi&s;it their Judicatures, where, be|&s;ides,
that few of their <HI>Gownmen,</HI>

<PB N="32" REF="21">
the talent of well &s;peaking; &s;o nei|ther

&s;upply the defects of the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI>
with flat, in&s;ipid, and gro&s;ly abu&s;ing
one another; a thing to trifling,
and misbecoming the gravity of <HI>Courts</HI>
(where the <HI>Lawyers</HI> take Liberty to
Je&s;t Mens E&s;tates away, and yet
avow their Avarice) that I have
much admired at the temper of the
Judges, and their remi&s;sne&s;s in re|forming
it: There was a Young Per|&s;on,
whom at my being there, was
very much cried up for his Abilities,
and in whom I did not ob&s;erve that
u&s;ual intemperance, which I but now
reproved; and certainly, it &s;prings
either for want of tho&s;e Abilities,
