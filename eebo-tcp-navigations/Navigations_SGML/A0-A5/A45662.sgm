<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of the <HI>King's Palace,</HI> and <HI>Gardens</HI> at <HI>Loo,</HI> was mo&s;t of it written at the Command of our late mo&s;t <HI>Incompa|rable Queen, of ever Glorious Memory,</HI> who was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the Sight of it; and who, though &s;he Honoured this <HI>Royal Fabrick</HI> with the laying its <HI>fir&s;t Stone,</HI> yet could never have the Plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing it Perfected: The <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Good Queen</HI>'s Pre|&s;ence being, during the War, mo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ary with|in the Kingdom, whil&s;t His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> expo&s;ed His <HI>Royal Per&s;on</HI> in the Field, for the Pre&s;ervation of us all, and for the Benefit of Mankind; and did &s;o eminently &s;ignalize him&s;elf abroad, that all the <HI>Mar|tial Virtues</HI> which are reported in Hi&s;tory to have belong'd unto any the mo&s;t Renowned of the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Grecian Heroes,</HI> have been evidently con&s;picuous, and United together in His <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Since this <HI>De&s;cription</HI> was fir&s;t written, it has been Corrected and Enlarged, by the frequent Opportu|nities I have had, of walking over the <HI>Gardens,</HI> in
<PB REF="3">the five Years time that I had the Honour to wait upon His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> abroad. And the Reading it mu&s;t give &s;ome Diver&s;ion to the Curious, as the Writing it was plea&s;ing to me. Al&s;o <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of <HI>Quality,</HI> and Great Fortunes, may here find many things to <HI>Ad|mire,</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>Imitate,</HI> if they plea&s;e, when they are taking their Summer Diver&s;ions at their Coun|try Seats.</P>
<P>As for what I add, in the <HI>Account</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> I &s;hall only tell you, I con&s;idered that a <HI>De&s;cription</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly repre&s;ent things with that plea&s;ure and advantage, as they are Seen upon the Place; and I thought a few <HI>Common Ob&s;ervations</HI> I made in <HI>Holland,</HI> and which I have recollected upon the <HI>Printing</HI> this <HI>De&s;cription,</HI> would not be unacceptable to &s;ome Per&s;ons, for <HI>Variety &s;ake;</HI> though I have been guilty of many Omi&s;&s;ions, rather than I would be tedious, by <HI>Con&s;ulting Authors,</HI> or reciting any of their <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> who have taken Pains upon this Subject, and been more large and accurate in their Performances.</P>

<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_NOTHING does give Po&s;terity &s;o Noble an Idea of former Times, as the <HI>Magnificence</HI> of their <HI>Buildings.</HI> The Remains we &s;till have of the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatne&s;s in their Publick Structures are enough to merit our highe&s;t admiration. The Ruins of their <HI>Amphitheatres</HI> as they are now to be &s;een, their immen&s;e <HI>Obelisks,</HI> their prodigious <HI>&s;Aquoeducts,</HI> their &s;plendid <HI>Palaces</HI> and <HI>Temples,</HI> their &s;ubterranean <HI>Catacombs,</HI> and even their <HI>Via Appia,</HI> and <HI>Flaminea,</HI> or their <HI>Cau&s;eways</HI> that were made near Two thou&s;and Years ago, when <HI>Rome</HI> was a <HI>Republick,</HI> with a Stone &s;o hard, and &s;o firmly laid, as &s;till to remain entire a good way in many Places, are all Objects &s;o con&s;picuous, and &s;o durable in their kinds, that &s;ome of
<PB N="2" REF="7">them are like to continue to the end of the World everla&s;ting Monuments of the ju&s;t Veneration due to Ancient Times, of their admirable Skill, if not Per|fection in <HI>Architecture;</HI> and in a word, as undoubted Te&s;timonies of the <HI>Splendor</HI> and <HI>Magnificence</HI> of the <HI>Greate&s;t People</HI> that ever were recorded in <HI>Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>What can give us &s;uch a repre&s;entation of the Pomp and Grandeur of the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as the Wonder|ful <HI>Pyramids</HI> there to be &s;een, and the illu&s;trious Ruins of <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> and <HI>Alexandria!</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> indeed have be&s;towed their Muni&s;icence chiefly in la&s;ting Monuments of their Piety, in erect|ing abundance of the Noble&s;t <HI>Cathedrals</HI> that can any|where be &s;een. And <HI>England</HI> may de&s;ervedly glory not only in the &s;lately <HI>Cathedrals</HI> &s;he built at home, as well as in her <HI>Palaces, Univer&s;ities,</HI> and other Pub|lick and Private Buildings, but hath le&s;t in <HI>France</HI> the la&s;ting Evidences of her <HI>Magnificence,</HI> by erecting tho&s;e &s;tately <HI>No&s;tredames</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Amiens,</HI> at <HI>Rouen,</HI> &amp;c. at a time when great part of <HI>France</HI> was under the <HI>Engli&s;h Dominion,</HI> and when the re&s;t of it did as much dread the <HI>Engli&s;h Power</HI> and <HI>Courage,</HI> as them&s;elves have of late years been a Terror to all their Neigh|bours. Nay at this pre&s;ent time, by the <HI>Publick Au|thority</HI> (to our Honour and Renown be it &s;poken) there is now erecting, and almo&s;t fini&s;hed, in her <HI>Me|tropolis,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Spacious and <HI>Magnificent Cathe|drals</HI> that ever yet was built in the World; and the which, in the judgment of Travellers, is like to emu|late in its Structure, even <HI>Saint Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many Noble and Stately <HI>Palaces</HI> both at home and abroad. <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> and <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> are too well known to be more than
<PB N="3" REF="7">mentioned. His <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> may di&s;pute for Ex|cellency in many re&s;pects with mo&s;t of the <HI>Royal Pa|laces</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> And at <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> there is another of His <HI>Maje&s;ty's Palaces,</HI> in a mo&s;t admirable Situation for <HI>Health</HI> as well as <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> that wants but little of being fini&s;hed. I cannot but wi&s;h this la&s;t were nearer to <HI>London,</HI> or were thereby better &s;ituated for His <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI>'s Convenience. For I have &s;en&s;ibly experienced the benefit of that Healthful Situation, having had the Happine&s;s to be Educated in the <HI>College</HI> at <HI>Winche&s;ter;</HI> where in Seven Years time I never knew one of the Seventy Children of that <HI>College</HI> to dye, although it be &s;eated in the lowe&s;t, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t un|healthy part of that City. And others have a&s;&s;ured me, that in Fifty Years pa&s;t, there have not died above four or five of that Excellent Seminary of Learn|ing, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e too by Violent Accidents, not by Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es. The which is a Con&s;idera|tion worthy of the thoughts of &s;uch Parents, who would do their utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve their Po&s;terity, and are de&s;irous to breed their Children in the <HI>be&s;t School</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Ancient Hereditary Palaces are di&s;per&s;ed in great number. The <HI>Royal Palace</HI> and <HI>Gardens</HI> at <HI>Loo</HI> are the Subject of the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e. I will only mention <HI>Dieren,</HI> an Ancient Seat of the mo&s;t <HI>Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> five Leagues from <HI>Loo; Hon&s;laer-Dike,</HI> two Leagues from the <HI>Hague; Soe&s;tdike,</HI> not far from <HI>Utrecht;</HI> the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Breda,</HI> made much more Illu|&s;trious of late by His <HI>Maje&s;ly; Ry&s;wick</HI> the au&s;picious Place of Treaty of Peace, and now rendred everla&s;t|ingly famous by the conclu&s;ion of a <HI>Peace</HI> &s;o Happy and &s;o Honourable to the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe.</HI> All
<PB N="4" REF="8">which <HI>Palaces</HI> (except the la&s;t, where the King has never re&s;ided, it being &s;o near the <HI>Hague</HI>) do remain nobly furni&s;hed for His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s reception, and have <HI>Gardens</HI> belonging to them that might merit a di&s;tinct De&s;cription.</P>
<P>For <HI>Buildings</HI> or them&s;elves, how&s;oever Noble and Great, do appear very deficient without the Ornament and Conveniencies of a <HI>Garden. Italy,</HI> the <HI>Garden</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> and the great Repo&s;itory of Rarities and Antiquities, does now as much glory and pride her &s;elf in the Pomp, and Ornaments, and Conveniencies belonging to her <HI>Gardens,</HI> as in any of her &s;o much celebrated Curio&s;ities. It is certainly one of the mo&s;t innocent and &s;weete&s;t Diver&s;ions that can be de&s;ired; it gives ea&s;y opportunities for Retirement and Contem|plation, and conduces to the obtaining a chearful tranquillity of mind, and to the pre&s;ervation of a healthful temper of Body. It is a delight and &s;atis&s;a|ction to which &s;ome of the <HI>Greate&s;t Princes</HI> and <HI>Noble|men</HI> in all Ages have had recour&s;e, after they had been &s;atiated and cloy'd with the plea&s;ures and Vanities of the World, or had been tired with the Cro&s;&s;es and Di&s;appointments, the Vexations and Troubles, which do nece&s;&s;arily attend all Conditions of Life. And if there be any tolerable &s;hare of <HI>Happine&s;&s;</HI> and <HI>Content</HI> to be any where enjoyed by an Innocent Man, out of the hurry and noi&s;e of the World, a compleat and &s;paci|ous <HI>Garden,</HI> furni&s;hed with variety of <HI>Walks</HI> and <HI>Groves,</HI> and adorned with <HI>Fountains, Ca&s;cades, Grottoes,</HI> &amp;c. mu&s;t do very much towards the obtaining even a <HI>Para|di&s;e</HI> upon Earth.</P>
<P>The Gardens of <HI>Loo</HI> are become &s;o famous and re|markable to all the <HI>Provinces</HI> near them, that Curious Per&s;ons from divers Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> as well as out
<PB N="5" REF="8">of all the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> do frequently re&s;ort thi|ther to &s;atisfy their Curio&s;ity. I will not here enlarge in their prai&s;e and admiration, but leave it to the Reader to make a true judgment of them from the <HI>De|&s;cription</HI> it &s;elf, which is at le&s;t natural and plain, and as per&s;picuous as the nature of &s;uch <HI>De&s;criptions</HI> (&s;ometimes nece&s;&s;arily intricate through the great va|riety of matter) will admit, though indeed very de|&s;titute of the ornaments and flouri&s;hes that are u&s;ually made in the <HI>de&s;cribing Great Things,</HI> to make them ap|pear <HI>Greater</HI> than they <HI>really</HI> are.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HIS <HI>Maje&s;ty's Place</HI> and <HI>Gardens</HI> at <HI>Loo</HI> are &s;itu|ated on the ca&s;t-&s;ide of a large Sandy <HI>Heath,</HI> or in the <HI>Veluwe,</HI> a con&s;iderable part of the Province of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> one of the <HI>Seven United Provinces.</HI> The <HI>Heath</HI> is extended Southward unto the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and Northward unto the <HI>Zuyder,</HI> or <HI>South Sea;</HI> We&s;tward it runs almo&s;t to <HI>Amersfort,</HI> or within le&s;s than two Leagues of it; and Ea&s;tward it is extended to the <HI>I&s;&s;el,</HI> a con&s;iderable River that divides <HI>Overy&s;&s;ell</HI> from the <HI>Veluwe. Loo</HI> is three Leagues from <HI>Deventer,</HI> five from <HI>Harderwick</HI> on the South-Sea, five from <HI>Dieren,</HI> ano|ther of His <HI>Maje&s;ty's Places,</HI> &s;ix from <HI>Arnheim,</HI> and twelve Leagues or Hours from <HI>Utrecht.</HI> It is an ex|cellent Country for <HI>Hunting,</HI> and abounds with <HI>Staggs,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Roe-bucks,</HI> the Wild <HI>Boar, Foxes, Hares,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Wolfs.</HI> It is no le&s;s excellent for <HI>Fowling,</HI> and has good &s;tore of <HI>Woodcocks, Partridges, Phea&s;ants,</HI> &amp;c. In a Wood near <HI>Loo,</HI> there is a <HI>Herniary</HI> for Hawking; and within a league of it North-ca&s;t, His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> has of late cau&s;ed to be made an Excellent <HI>Decoy,</HI> which &s;upplies his Family with good &s;tore of <HI>Ducks</HI> and <HI>Teale.</HI> And in the <HI>Heath</HI> beyond the <HI>Gardens,</HI> there are &s;ix <HI>Vi|vers</HI> or large <HI>Fi&s;h-ponds,</HI> &s;omewhat after the model or re&s;emblance of tho&s;e in <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> the one commu|nicating with the other. You will &s;ind them de|&s;cribed
<PB N="7" REF="9">at the end of this Treati&s;e, in the Seventh Chapter.</P>
<P>The <HI>New Palace,</HI> lately built by His <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> is near unto the <HI>Old Hoof,</HI> or <HI>Old Court,</HI> which is a <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> &s;ur|rounded with a broad Moat, and purcha&s;ed about 12 or 14 Years ago from the <HI>Seigneur de Laeckhuy&s;en,</HI> a Gen|tleman of this Country. They are &s;eparated from one another only by &s;ome of the <HI>Gardens,</HI> which lye on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>New Palace.</HI> The <HI>Gardens</HI> are mo&s;t Sumptuous and Magnificent, adorned with great variety of mo&s;t Noble <HI>Fountains, Ca&s;cades, Parterres, Gravel Walks,</HI> and <HI>Green Walks, Groves, Statues, Urns, Paintings, Seats,</HI> and plea&s;ant Pro&s;pects into the Country.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Gate</HI> that enters into the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Pa|lace,</HI> there is a broad Green <HI>Walk</HI> between a double row of Oaks, half a mile long; and at the end of this Walk next to the <HI>Heath,</HI> there is a <HI>Gate</HI> of Iron Rails between double Stone <HI>Pillars</HI> of an <HI>Ancient</HI> Model, the <HI>Pillars</HI> being about a yard di&s;tant from each other, and joined at the top by a <HI>Crown Work</HI> on each &s;ide, where|in is cut His <HI>Maje&s;ty's Cypher,</HI> and at the bottom by a Stone Ground-work, or <HI>Supporters.</HI> The <HI>Golumns</HI> are of a good heighth. Before this Gate there are <HI>three Walks</HI> between <HI>Trees</HI> for a Mile, or more, farther into the <HI>Heath.</HI></P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Palace</HI> we do enter through a large <HI>Gate</HI> of Iron Bars, painted Blew and Gildel, into a <HI>Quadrangular Court,</HI> of which the whole Sought|&s;ide hath Iron Rails alike Painted and Gilded. The Rails are placed on a low Brick Wall that is covered with Free-&s;tone the whole length, five Inches above the Brick.

<PB N="8" REF="10">due di&s;tance eight and twenty <HI>Pila&s;ters,</HI> every one of them of <HI>one entire Stone.</HI> The Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Court</HI> does contain Offices and Chambers for the <HI>Officers</HI> and Servants of His <HI>Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold.</HI> On the We&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Court</HI> are the <HI>King's Stables,</HI> and in the&s;e are kept <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> for His <HI>Maje&s;ty's own riding.</HI> And at the end of this <HI>Stable,</HI> adjoining to the Rails before-men|tioned, there is another <HI>double Stable</HI> for His <HI>Maje&s;ty's other Hor&s;es,</HI> and for tho&s;e of &s;ome of his Servants, extended We&s;tward about eighty Paces on the Road that comes from <HI>Utrecht.</HI> At the other end of the Rails, or adjoining to the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Court,</HI> upon the Road, there is another Row of <HI>Building,</HI> in pro|portion to the <HI>Stables,</HI> containing a Guard-hou&s;e, a large <HI>Orangery,</HI> or Green-hou&s;e, the <HI>King's Coach-hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the middle of the <HI>Court</HI> there is a <HI>Fountain,</HI> who&s;e Ba&s;in con&s;i&s;ts of a wrought blew Stone, and who&s;e Stone-work is rai&s;ed two Foot and a half high.

The <HI>Dolphins</HI> are placed upon a Marble Pede&s;tal; their Tails are inter|twi&s;ted, and turned upward in the middle of the Pe|de&s;tal. But this <HI>Fountain</HI> has been ordered to be changed into a Noble <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> in a octangular Ba&s;in, &s;even yards <HI>diameter.</HI> Next unto the Walk that en|compa&s;&s;es this <HI>Fountain,</HI> there are in this <HI>Court</HI> four <HI>Gazons,</HI> or Green Plots, with Walks on every &s;ide pa|ved with Brick.</P>
<P>On the North-&s;ide of the <HI>Court</HI> in the <HI>King's Palace,</HI> to which we a&s;cend by nine broad Stone-&s;teps. The <HI>Palace</HI> is built of Brick, and had the Honour to have its fir&s;t Stone laid by the hands of the mo&s;t <HI>Incompa|rable</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. II</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing the De&s;cription of the <HI>Great Garden,</HI> next behind the <HI>Palace;</HI> and fir&s;t of that part of it called the <HI>Lower Garden.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SO &s;oon as we have pa&s;s'd through the <HI>Place,</HI> we do enter upon a very broad <HI>Terras-walk,</HI> extended on the right and left the whole breadth of this Gar|den, the which is continued forwards by a Brick-wall, and by other Terras-walks on the right and left &s;ides of it. The fir&s;t Terras-walk is paved with Brick four|teen yards forwards, between the Garden Gate and the Stone-&s;teps, by which we are to de&s;cend into the Garden. It is al&s;o paved with Brick thirty paces both to the right and left. From the &s;aid paving, this Terras|walk is continued to the Garden Walls on each &s;ide, in a green and gravel Walk. The middle part of this
<PB N="13" REF="12">Walk is Green about &s;i&s;teen foot, and on each &s;ide of the Green there is a Gravel-walk, each of them ten foot broad.</P>
<P>At both ends of this fir&s;t Terras-walk we do a&s;cend by &s;even Steps unto the &s;ide Terras-walks, which are rai&s;ed higher than the former, for the better placing of tho&s;e Noble Stone-&s;abricks that compo&s;e the <HI>Ca&s;|cades</HI> of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us</HI> and <HI>Galatea.</HI> The&s;e Terras-walks do, like the former, con&s;i&s;t of a Green-walk in the middle, and a Gravel-walk on each &s;ide of the Green. In the middle of the&s;e &s;ide Terras-walks, behind the <HI>Ca&s;|cades,</HI> there are <HI>Seats</HI> next to the Walls, and painted Green.</P>
<P>From the <HI>fir&s;t Terras-walk,</HI> near the <HI>Garden-gate</HI> of the <HI>Palace,</HI> there is a very large de&s;cent into the <HI>Gar|den,</HI> fir&s;t by three Semicircular Stone-&s;teps, and after a little &s;pace by fifteen Steps more, all of a very large circumference, the lowermo&s;t of tho&s;e fifteen Steps be|ing <HI>twenty eight yards round.</HI></P>
<P>On the right &s;ide of the fore&s;aid Steps, upon the Terras-walk, there is a large <HI>Stone-Statue,</HI> with a <HI>Hart</HI> behind it, and on the left &s;uch another great <HI>Statue,</HI> both lying or leaning on a di&s;tinct <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> and both holding under one Arm a Stone-ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e <HI>two Statues</HI> and intended to repre&s;ent two great <HI>Rivers,</HI> the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>I&s;&s;el,</HI> between the which Rivers, the <HI>Veluwe,</HI> and <HI>Loo</HI> are &s;ituate. Out of tho&s;e Stone-ve&s;&s;els there runs Water, which makes an <HI>unexpected Ca&s;cade</HI> on both &s;ides of the <HI>Steps</HI> adjoining to the Wall. The&s;e <HI>Ca&s;cades</HI> are made from the &s;aid Stone-ve&s;&s;els, on each &s;ide, into &s;even double Ba&s;ins, one below another, be&s;ides an eighth large &s;ingle Ba&s;in, which receives the Water of all the re&s;t, at the bottom of the Steps. All the&s;e Ba&s;ins are of a blew Stone. The one half of
<PB N="14" REF="13">the&s;e double Ba&s;ins is rai&s;ed two or three Inches, in order to retain the Water, and the other half is equal|ly &s;unk or made lower, that the &s;heet of Water may fall from the upper into the lower Ba&s;ins.</P>
<P>From all the three Terras-walks there is a Green &s;lope, reaching from tho&s;e Walks above unto a low Brick-wall below, that is only two foot high; at the four corners of the&s;e Slopes, in this Garden, there are broad Steps for de&s;cending from the Walks above. And at the upper part of the <HI>Green Slopes</HI> there are abundance of little Pipes of water, about a foot di|&s;tance one from the other. Each of them hath a Cop|per head, wherein there are four &s;mall holes, through which the water is made to play, in order to water the <HI>Slopes,</HI> and to pre&s;erve them always <HI>Green.</HI> In the Summer Evenings they are made frequently to rain a &s;mall &s;hower for the end aforc&s;aid.</P>
<P>In the low Walk below the Green Slopes, at every four yards di&s;tance, there are white Stones, each of them above a foot and a half &s;quare, on every one of which there are <HI>Urns</HI> and noble <HI>Flowerpots</HI> placed, or to be placed, as on Ba&s;es: And &s;ome of them have repre&s;entations of divers <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Modern Curio&s;i|ties</HI> carved upon them.</P>
<P>And all along the Wall of the <HI>Lower Garden,</HI> whi|ther that which &s;eparates the fir&s;t Terras Walk from the <HI>King's,</HI> and <HI>Queen's Garden,</HI> or tho&s;e that &s;eparate the higher Terras-walks from the two <HI>Wilderne&s;&s;es,</HI> tho&s;e Walls have &s;uch white &s;quare Stones near about the &s;ame di&s;tance from one another, and for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the top of the &s;aid green <HI>Slopes</HI> there do grow many <HI>Pyramidal Juniper-trees,</HI> with other curious Shrubs intermixed among them. The <HI>Slope</HI> from the fir&s;t Terras-walk to the low Walk at bottom is about
<PB N="15" REF="13">eleven foot: but the Slopes from the &s;ide Terras|walks to the &s;aid low Wall have a de&s;cent of about fif|teen foot, the&s;e being rai&s;ed higher than the former Walk, on the account of the <HI>Ca&s;cades</HI> before-mentioned.</P>
<P>When we have de&s;cended into the <HI>Garden</HI> by the fore&s;aid eighteen Stone-&s;teps, we do enter upon a broad Gravel Walk, into which advancing forty &s;ive paces from the Steps, we come to a Noble <HI>Fountain,</HI> in the middle of who&s;e <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> is a Marble Statue of <HI>Venus</HI> at full length, and another of <HI>Cupid</HI> under her left hand, he holding a gilded Bow. This <HI>Statue</HI> is &s;upported on a &s;mall <HI>Whale</HI> for its <HI>Pede&s;tal,</HI> with four great gilded <HI>Tritons</HI> behow it, a large gilded <HI>Shell</HI> being between each of the <HI>Tritons,</HI> and each <HI>Triton</HI> blowing in a large <HI>Trumpet</HI> in one hand, their other hand being di&s;pofed in different po&s;tures. At the end of each <HI>Trumpet</HI> the water runs out in a broad &s;heer, incir|cling a great part of the broad end of the <HI>Trumpet.</HI> Al&s;o about the <HI>Tritons</HI> there are many gilded Ru&s;hes, and Water-lilly Flowers, which do all contribute to the ornament of this <HI>Magnificent Fountain.</HI> On the right and left of this <HI>Statue,</HI> Within the &s;ame <HI>Ba&s;in,</HI> as al&s;o before and behind the <HI>Statue,</HI> there are four Gilded <HI>Swans,</HI> which do &s;pout the water in broad &s;heets towards the <HI>Statue;</HI> and all the <HI>Swans</HI> are rai&s;ed a lit|tle above the water. The <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> is bordered with a blew Stone about &s;ixteen inches breadth. It has four Angles, but on the four &s;ides where the <HI>Swans</HI> are placed, it has a circumflexion or &s;emicircular cut in|to the Walks, in form of four <HI>Half-moons.</HI></P>
<P>On either &s;ide of this <HI>broad Walk,</HI> next to the Par|terres, both before we come to the fore&s;aid Fountain, and al&s;o on the &s;ides of the Walk beyond the Foun|tain, there are <HI>Spouts</HI> at proper di&s;tances in a di&s;tinct
<PB N="16" REF="14"><HI>Canal;</HI> and there are <HI>&s;ix Spouts</HI> in each of them, which do throw up the water about a yard, though of late tho&s;e Spouts are now always &s;topt, to avoid the incon|venience of the waters being blown on the Walk, or on the Parterres. The&s;e <HI>Canals</HI> are walled with Free-&s;tone, and bordered with the &s;ame three inches breadth. They are each of them about eighty foot long, and a foot and a half broad, but in tho&s;e parts where the <HI>Spouts</HI> are placed, the <HI>Canals</HI> are widened unto three foot and a half &s;qure every way, in order to avoid the Winds blowing the water either on the Walk, or Parterres. The&s;e <HI>Canals</HI> are paved, after the <HI>Mo|&s;aick</HI> manner, with Pebbles of a dark colour, but the Figures that are made by the Pebbles, and which run along the middle of the <HI>Canals,</HI> and e&s;pecially about the <HI>Spouts,</HI> are made in a long &s;ort of Pebbles, pure white and black, of the Diamond cut.</P>
<P>If we advance &s;till forwards beyond the <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Venus</HI> in the &s;ame Walk, we behold another Noble <HI>Fountain,</HI> in the middle of who&s;e Ba&s;in is a young na|ked <HI>Hercules</HI> of Marble, ari&s;ing as from his Cradle, al|&s;o of Marble; the <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;queezing a green <HI>Serpent</HI> in each hand, and both the <HI>Serpents</HI> &s;pirting the water about two yards above the Ba&s;in. On the right and left of the <HI>Hercules,</HI> at a little di&s;tance, within the &s;ame Ba&s;in, there are placed two <HI>Dra|gons,</HI> each &s;pirting &s;even &s;everal <HI>Jette</HI>'s towards the <HI>Hercules.</HI> The Ba&s;in of this Fountain is likewi&s;e bor|dered with a broad blew Stone, &s;ixteen inches breadth; and paved with a Stone that is about a foot &s;quare.</P>
<P>Turning out of the afore&s;aid Walk, from the Foun|tain of <HI>Venus,</HI> into a Cro&s;s-walk on the right, we meet with a <HI>Fountain</HI> in the middle, wherein is erected a <HI>Cele&s;tial Globe,</HI> placed on a Marble Pede&s;tal, between
<PB N="17" REF="14">which <HI>Pede&s;tal</HI> and the <HI>Globe</HI> there are four naked <HI>Boys</HI> in Marble, incircling one another in ther Arms. About the <HI>Globe</HI> the twelve <HI>Signs</HI> of the <HI>Zodiack</HI> are curiou&s;ly painted, the <HI>Stars</HI> Gilded, and out of abun|dance of the <HI>Stars</HI> there do &s;pout out <HI>Jettes</HI> on all &s;ides of the <HI>Globe.</HI></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing beyond this <HI>Globe,</HI> we behold at the end of the Walk a mo&s;t Noble <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> a Fabrick of wrought Stone, reaching from the Terras-walk above, down to the Gravel-walk below. The water here falls out of the Mouth of a great <HI>Head</HI> at the top of the Stru|cture (a round carved covered Ba&s;in being placed above the <HI>Head</HI>) into three great &s;emi-oval carved Ba&s;ins, one below the other, each of them being two yards in front, be&s;ides the allowance of above two foot more on both &s;ides of the two lowermo&s;t of tho&s;e three Ba|&s;ins, which two foot do &s;erve for conveying the water that is to make the le&s;&s;er &s;heets, which will be pre|&s;ently mentioned. On both &s;ides of the <HI>uppermo&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e three Semi-oval Ba&s;ins there is placed a <HI>Pine|apple</HI> in Stone, by way of ornament; and on both &s;ides of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of tho&s;e Ba&s;ins, is erected a round &s;collopt Ba&s;in of two foot diameter, that has a <HI>Spout</HI> in the middle, which throws up the water about two foot. From three parts of tho&s;e round &s;collopt Ba&s;ins, as well as from the whole front of the three great &s;emi-oval Ba&s;ins, the water does fall into the upper|mo&s;t of &s;ix le&s;&s;er &s;emi-oval Ba&s;ins placed on each &s;ide. The&s;e le&s;&s;er Ba&s;ins are about a yard in front, be&s;ides an allowance of about two more for the forming of the &s;maller falls of water that are now to be men|tioned. On each &s;ide of the &s;ix le&s;&s;er Ba&s;ins, both on the right and left of the Structure, there are made lit|tle &s;heets of water one below another in &s;ix de&s;cents,
<PB N="18" REF="15">contiguous to tho&s;e made from the fore&s;aid le&s;&s;er Ba|&s;ins. But at the bottom of this Fabrick, between the falls on both &s;ides, there is an excellent Statue of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us</HI> at length in Marble, &s;tanding upright, but looking a little downward into the water in the com|mon Ba&s;in, or Receiver below; and holding a <HI>Hunt|ing Horn</HI> in one hand, whilft he draws up the other by way of Admiration, at the beholding his own re|flection in the water.</P>
<P>Again, turning from the <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Venus</HI> on the left hand the &s;ame di&s;tance in this Cro&s;s-walk, as we did before from thence on the right to come to the <HI>Cele&s;tial Globe,</HI> there is, I &s;ay, on the left &s;uch ano|ther Noble Fountain, in the middle of which is crect|ed a <HI>Terre&s;trial Globe.</HI> On this <HI>Globe, Europe, A&s;ia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> the four parts of the World, are exactly painted, and out of the &s;everal parts of it there do &s;pring a great number of <HI>Spouts,</HI> which throw up the water from all parts round it, as in the former <HI>Globe.</HI> This is likewi&s;e placed on a high Pede&s;tal, round which there are four naked <HI>Boys</HI> in <HI>Marble,</HI> the fir&s;t with a <HI>Crown</HI> on his <HI>head,</HI> the &s;econd with a <HI>Tur|hant,</HI> the third a <HI>Negro</HI> in his &s;hort frizled hair, and the fourth with long hair hanging down his back: The four Boys repre&s;enting the Inhabitants of the four parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>At the end of this Walk, beyond this <HI>Globe,</HI> and on the &s;lope of the oppo&s;ite Terras-walk, there is &s;uch another admirable <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> as was ju&s;t now de&s;cribed.

<HEAD>CHAP. III</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Second Part of the <HI>Creat Garden,</HI> called the <HI>Upper Garden;</HI> together with the <HI>Middle Walk,</HI> and <HI>Canals,</HI> which do divide this Garden into the two Parts.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we are up the two Stone-&s;teps now mentioned, we pa&s;s over a <HI>Canal</HI> into the <HI>Middle Cro&s;s-walk,</HI> that divides this Garden, and is remarkable for its double row of tall Oaks on both
<PB N="21" REF="16">&s;ides of it. This Walk is eighteen yards broad from the two Stone-&s;teps, and Rails, unto the Bridge over which we are to pa&s;s the &s;econd Canal, in order to go into the <HI>Upper Garden.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t Canal</HI> is five foot broad, the <HI>&s;econd</HI> is fourteen foot. They run from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, and are &s;upplied from <HI>Ca&s;cades</HI> that are made at the We&s;t-end of the fore&s;aid Walk, which has Iron-rails fa&s;tned in Free-&s;tone, that is half a foot above the Brick-wall, and that hath al&s;o divers Stone-pila&s;ters, ten Inches broad, and as high as then Iron-rails. Be|tween tho&s;e Rails there is a Gate of wrought Iron, through which we are to pa&s;s into the <HI>Gardens</HI> near the <HI>Old Hoof.</HI></P>
<P>From a Marble <HI>Head,</HI> placed in this Wall over the <HI>Canals,</HI> there is on each &s;ide a double fall of Water into two Stone-Ba&s;ins, that are one below the other. The uppermo&s;t Ba&s;in is about a yard in front, and the lowermo&s;t a yard and a half.</P>
<P>About the <HI>Bridge</HI> of the <HI>&s;econd Canal,</HI> there is a <HI>Stonework,</HI> that is extended both Ea&s;t and We&s;t from the Bridge about &s;ifteen foot. At both ends of this Stone-work, which cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Canal,</HI> a <HI>Fountain</HI> ri&s;es in the middle of the Crofs-wall, and by the declivity of a Ba&s;in both ways forms a &s;heet of water both Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and al&s;o the &s;ame on both &s;ides of the Bridge. Moreover, out of the Walls that are on both &s;ides of this <HI>Canal,</HI> and al&s;o on each &s;ide of the <HI>Bridge,</HI> there are other falls of water from <HI>Stone-ba&s;ins,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome others in other parts of the <HI>Canal,</HI> made by rai&s;ing the water, of &s;topping its pa&s;&s;age, to a certain heighth. The&s;e <HI>Canals</HI> are all along bordered with green Turf, and have a green Slope reaching from the border down to the Water.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="17">
<P>Advancing forwards from the <HI>&s;econd Canal</HI> about a hundred Paces, in a very broad Gravel-walk, we come to a mo&s;t <HI>Remarkable Fountain,</HI> of a va&s;t circum|ference. The <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> of it is <HI>Octangular,</HI> and there are &s;ixteen Paces di&s;tance between each of the eight An|gles. In the whole it is a <HI>hundred and twenty eight Paces round.</HI> 'Tis bordered with a broad rai&s;ed Stone-work, and paved with Pebbles, like many of the other Foun|tains, in divers &s;orts of uniform Figures. In the mid|dle of this <HI>Great Ba&s;in</HI> there is a <HI>Spout</HI> that throws up the water <HI>forty four,</HI> or <HI>forty five foot high</HI> perpendicu|lar. And round about this <HI>Spout</HI> there are placed two ranks of other <HI>Spout,</HI> each of the ranks containing &s;ixteen, which do all at a &s;mall di&s;tance encompa&s;s that High one in the middle. The inmo&s;t of the&s;e two ranks do throw up the water twelve foot high, and the out|mo&s;t rank &s;ix foot. This Noble Fountain containing no le&s;s than <HI>three and thirty Spouts,</HI> does make an agreable &s;hower of them together, and mu&s;t abun|dantly plea&s;e and divert the mo&s;t curious Spectator. The water of the <HI>Spout</HI> which throws it up &s;o many foot high, is brought from a <HI>Hill</HI> two Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Loo,</HI> and called <HI>A&s;&s;elt.</HI> But the <HI>&s;ixteen Spouts</HI> which do immediately encompa&s;s that High Spout, are brought from another Source, called <HI>Orden,</HI> about a League off. And the re&s;t of them are &s;upplied from the <HI>Viver.</HI></P>
<P>A little beyond this Great Fountain, in the &s;ame Walk, we de&s;cend by three wide Stone-&s;teps to ano|ther admirable Fountain, in the middle of which there are four naked <HI>Boys</HI> in <HI>Marble,</HI> with four <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> be|tween them, tho&s;e <HI>Boys</HI> and <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> repre&s;enting the <HI>four parts of the World.</HI> Over the <HI>Boys Heads</HI> there are four gilded <HI>&s;collop Shells,</HI> and over the inmo&s;t part of
<PB N="23" REF="17">tho&s;e Shells a gilded <HI>Ba&s;in inverted.</HI> Out of the mid|dle of this Ba&s;in the water ri&s;es in form of a <HI>Peacock's Tail</HI> &s;pread out at length, about a foot and a half above the <HI>inverted Ba&s;in.</HI> This Fountain hath its Ba&s;in bor|dered with Free-&s;tone, &s;ixteen inches broad, and its Stone-work rai&s;ed three or four inches. From the &s;aid Border to the bottom of the Ba&s;in, there is rough Rockwork of divers Colours. But the bottom it &s;elf is bordered with White Marble ten inches round, and the re&s;t of the bottom is paved with dark Pebble, among which there are al&s;o intermixed Marble Stones in divers Figures.</P>
<P>As we do a&s;cend from this Fountain forwards, we meet with a Fall of water from <HI>one &s;emioval Stone Ba&s;in,</HI> ex|tended four foot and a half in front, and placed be|tween three Stone Steps on each &s;ide of it. At the four Corners of tho&s;e Steps, Ba&s;es are rai&s;ed for the placing of Flower-pots. And round this Fountain there is a Green Slope equal to the height of the Steps, by which we de&s;cend to, or a&s;cend from the afore&s;aid <HI>Fountain.</HI> Farthermore, between tho&s;e Steps and the Border of the Ba&s;in to this Fountain, there is a round Gravel Walk above four yards broad.</P>
<P>Going ten Paces forwards beyond the former <HI>Ca&s;|cade,</HI> we come to another, where the Water falls from <HI>Three Stone Ba&s;ins,</HI> one below another; whereof the up|permo&s;t is about three foot in front, that in the mid|dle four foot and a half, and the lowermo&s;t five foot, be&s;ides a farther exten&s;ion of the&s;e Ba&s;ins on both &s;ides, for the making of le&s;&s;er Sheets of Water of eleven inches each in front, which are likewi&s;e one below another in three de&s;cents. Here is al&s;o an a&s;cent of five &s;tone &s;teps on both &s;ides of the Water, with four
<PB N="24" REF="18">Ba&s;es at the four Corners of tho&s;e Steps, for the pla|cing of Flower-pots.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as we are up the&s;e Steps, we do pre&s;ently turn on the right and left of the Walk into <HI>Semicircu|lar Galleries</HI> or <HI>Porticoes,</HI> below which there are two Green <HI>Slopes,</HI> one below the other; and between tho&s;e <HI>Slopes</HI> there are Flower-pots di&s;po&s;ed the whole length of them. Each of the&s;e <HI>Galleries</HI> is forty paces long, and about &s;ix yards broad; and each of them is &s;up|ported by <HI>twenty Pillars.</HI> They are covered with <HI>Lead</HI> to &s;helter from the Rain, and have White Balli&s;ters four foot high upon the <HI>Leads,</HI> to which there is an a&s;cent by Stairs behind the <HI>Galleries.</HI> On the Wall within the <HI>Galleries,</HI> there are drawn the <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>God|de&s;&s;es</HI> at length in <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> thirteen of them in each <HI>Gal|lery.</HI> They are paved with White and Red Brick. At the farther end of them there is a de&s;cent of &s;even Steps into the Garden.</P>
<P>Beyond the&s;e <HI>Galleries</HI> the former Walk <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ontinues between Kitchen Gardens on our right and left, but we cannot &s;ee them by rea&s;on of a Hedge of <HI>Dutch</HI> Elm five yards high. At the farther end of this Walk Northwards, we come to another <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> and <HI>Foun|tain.</HI> The <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> is from one plain, long Ba&s;in, about eight foot in front. On both &s;ides of it we do a&s;cend by three Stone Steps that are five yards in length, unto another <HI>Fountain,</HI> that has no <HI>Spout</HI> in it. The Ba&s;in of it is oval, and but &s;even foot in length. On both &s;ides of this <HI>Fountain</HI> there are <HI>Seats,</HI> covered above, painted behind in <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> and paved below with <HI>white Marble.</HI> The open &s;pace about this <HI>Fountain,</HI> and be|tween the <HI>Seats,</HI> is paved with a Black, White, and Yellowi&s;h Pebble, &s;et in divers Figures.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="18">
<P>And here going up two Stone-&s;teps more, that are extended the whole breadth of the Walk, we are &s;topt from going farther by large Iron Balu&s;ters, and a <HI>Canal</HI> beyond them. In the Canal below, there is another <HI>Fountain</HI> in the mid&s;t of <HI>Gardans,</HI> made of Shells, Petrified Earths, or &s;pungy Stones, from the top of which the water does fall on three rows, or Garlands of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances, placed one below another. La&s;tly, on both &s;ides of this Fountain there are other Falls of water to be &s;een below.</P>
<P>Nor is our view here limited, though our pa&s;&s;age be; for looking on &s;till forwards, we carry our pro|&s;pect between Trees, unto a <HI>high Pyramid,</HI> erected in the <HI>Heath,</HI> about half a mile's di&s;tance from the end of the <HI>Garden.</HI></P>
<P>In this <HI>Second Divi&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Garden</HI> there are twelve <HI>Parterres,</HI> with Gravel-walks between them all. The &s;ix inmo&s;t <HI>Quarters</HI> adjoining, three of a &s;ide, to the middle Broad-walk, through which we pa&s;&s;ed, do con&s;i&s;t divers Figures in green, encompa&s;&s;ed with Beds of Flowers, in the which there are divers Juniper Trees growing up Pyramidal about green round Staves, and placed at convenient di&s;tances. The &s;ix outermo&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Quarters,</HI> next to the Garden-wall on both &s;ides, are all plain green.</P>
<P>From the low Wall at the bottom of the fir&s;t Terras-walk, unto the Stone Rails or Steps in the <HI>Lower Gar|den</HI> on the South-&s;ide of the middle Cro&s;s-walk, it is about a hundred and twelve Paces. And from the Steps of the &s;ide Terras-walk on the right, unto the oppo&s;ite Steps of the other Terras-walk on the left, it is two hundred and twenty Paces.</P>

The other is a large <HI>Bowling-green.</HI> The three Parterres do con&s;i&s;t of Beds of Flowers, bordered with Box in divers figures, with Pyramids of Juniper, or Box, in many parts of them. The <HI>Fountain</HI> is bor|dered with white Marble, thirteen Inches broad: In the middle of this <HI>Fountain</HI> there is a gilded <HI>Triton,</HI> holding under his left Arm a gilded <HI>Dolphin,</HI> out of who&s;e Mouth &s;prings a <HI>Jette,</HI> that throws up the wa|ter about &s;ix foot high.

<P>The <HI>Bowling-green</HI> lies on the South-&s;ide of this Garden, and has the <HI>King's Stables</HI> adjoining on two &s;ides of it.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of the Gravel-walk, that is be|tween the <HI>King's Garden</HI> and the <HI>Bowling-green,</HI> we do pa&s;s through a Gate of Iron Rails, partly gilded, and partly painted Blew, into another Garden, called the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> or Wilderne&s;s.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="19">
<P>When we have here cro&s;s'd a Gravel-walk, a Hedge, and a Green-walk, we come to an a&s;cent of three Stone-&s;teps, on both &s;ides of which there is a Stone Fa|brick with Balli&s;ters in the middle, and four wrought Flowerpots covered, one on each &s;ide of the Balli&s;ters. From the Stone-work on each &s;ide of the Steps, the water falls from three Marble Heads into a common Ba&s;in bordered and walled with Stone; in each of the&s;e Ba&s;ins there are two <HI>Spouts</HI> which do throw up the water &s;ix foot high.</P>
<P>Advancing We&s;tward from the &s;aid Steps about thin|ty &s;ix Paces, we come to a <HI>Fountain,</HI> in the middle of which there are <HI>four Sea-Cupids</HI> in Stone, &s;itting on <HI>four Dolphins.</HI> Between the <HI>Cupids</HI> there ri&s;es a <HI>Spout</HI> out a <HI>Serpent's Head,</HI> that throws up the water about five foot, and out of every no&s;tril of the four <HI>Dolphins</HI> there do run other little <HI>Spouts.</HI> The Border of the Ba&s;in of this Fountain is a rai&s;ed Stone-work; and it is pa|ved with white Pebbles, but towards the Angles (the Ba&s;in being octangular) there are Figures of large Flowerdeluces in a dark Pebble.</P>
<P>At this <HI>Fountain</HI> there are <HI>eight</HI> &s;everal <HI>Walks</HI> to be Teen, between Hedges of an equal heighth, all the Hedges being between &s;even and eight foot high.

<P>North and South from this Foutain, at forty Paces di&s;tance, we come unto other Fountains. In the mid|dle
<PB N="28" REF="20">of that Northwards, there are two <HI>little Boys</HI> of Stone, with an <HI>Otter</HI> between them, out of who&s;e mouth there ri&s;es a <HI>Jette,</HI> &s;ix foot high. It is border|ed with rough Rockwork of divers colours, with &s;ome large <HI>Concha,</HI> or Shells intermixed: The bottom of the Ba&s;in is paved with white and brown Pebbles in different Figures.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Fountain of the <HI>Sea-Cupids</HI> Southward, there is another Fountain, in the middle of which there is a <HI>naked Boy</HI> in Stone, hold|ing a &s;collopt Shell in his hand, through which there ri&s;es another <HI>Jette</HI> like to the la&s;t now mentioned; and below this <HI>Boy</HI> there is a <HI>Satyr</HI> in Stone.

<P>In the middle of each of the&s;e four little Gardens, there is a di&s;tinct Fountain, and in each of the Foun|tains there is place a gilded <HI>Triton,</HI> &s;itting on a gild|ed <HI>Sea-Hor&s;e,</HI> or an a <HI>Sea-Goat,</HI> all upon Rockwork, like that in the middle Fountain; and the Ba&s;ins of the&s;e are paved like the former. But the&s;e <HI>four Tritons</HI> and Ba&s;ins are le&s;s in proportion than that in the mid|dle Fountain. One of the&s;e four <HI>Tritons</HI> holds a <HI>Cup</HI> in his Right hand, through which there ri&s;es a <HI>Jette</HI> &s;ix of &s;even foot. The &s;econd holds a <HI>Trident</HI> in his hand, and through the three Spikes of the <HI>Trident</HI> are made three Dards or Spouts. The third holds a <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> and makes a <HI>Spout</HI> through the Mouth of the <HI>Fi&s;h.</HI> And the fourth blows another through a twined <HI>Trum|pet.</HI> All the <HI>Spouts</HI> in the&s;e four Fountains do ri&s;e much about the &s;ame height. And be&s;ides the&s;e, the <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI> on which the four <HI>Trions</HI> do ride, do all make a little &s;heet of water from their Tongues.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t and large&s;t of the&s;e five <HI>Tritons,</HI> pla|ced in the middle of tho&s;e other four Fountains, and the Arbors, there are eight &s;emicircular <HI>Seats,</HI> covered behind and over head Arbor-like; the <HI>Seats</HI> and Prop|work, and al&s;o the Prop-work of all the Arbors being painted green. Every one of the&s;e <HI>Seats</HI> is above eight foot wide, and ten foot high. And between the
<PB N="32" REF="22">four Gravel-walks, which come to this Fountain from the middle of the four Side-Arbor walks, there are two of the&s;e eight Seats, as al&s;o between every two Seats there is an entrance five foot wide into the Par|torres of one of the four le&s;&s;er Fountains.</P>
<P>All along the&s;e Gravel-walks, and round the mid|dle Fountain, there are placed Orange-trees, and Lem|mon Trees in portable Wooden Frames, and Flower-pots about them.</P>
<P>In a corner of the <HI>Queen's Garden,</HI> next to the Ter|ras-walk of the <HI>Great Garden,</HI> and under one corner of the <HI>Palace,</HI> there is a fine <HI>Grotto,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the Roots of Trees, Flints, and Shells, di&s;po&s;ed in a rough <HI>Grote&s;co</HI> manner, and in one corner of this <HI>Grotto</HI> there is a <HI>Aviary.</HI></P>
<P>The Room for the <HI>Grotto</HI> is paved with Black and White <HI>Marble,</HI> there being two Fountains in it over|again&s;t one another, and they are rai&s;ed Arch-wi&s;e from the bottom to the top of the Room, the border round the Fountains being rai&s;ed above a foot from the floor, in order to hinder the water from wetting the Room. The &s;ides are embelli&s;hed with divers &s;orts of Shells, and all parts of the Windows beauti&s;ied with the &s;ame, in divers Figures. There are three Gates or Pa&s;&s;ages into this Room, one from the <HI>Queen's Gar|den,</HI> another from the <HI>Great Garden,</HI> under the Terras-walk, the third goes into a little Room, where a Couch is placed for Repo&s;e, and thence we go into another Room adorned all over with abundance of <HI>Porcelaine,</HI> or <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Aviary</HI> is expo&s;ed to the open Air, but incom|pa&s;&s;ed with a &s;mall Grate, to confine the Birds; and there is a place in the corner of the <HI>Grotto</HI> for the Birds to retreat into, from the Rain, or Weather.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="22">
<P>On the Ea&s;t&s;ide of the <HI>Queen's Garden,</HI> there is ano|ther Garden for retirement, with Walks, and Hedges of Witch-Elm, about eight foot high; into which we do pa&s;s out of the former through a Gate of wrought Iron, painted Blew and Gilt. Turning in it North|wards in the &s;econd Walk, we come to a Noble <HI>Foun|tain,</HI> unto which we de&s;cend by &s;ix Stops; but in the middle of the&s;e Steps there is a &s;mall fall of water in &s;ix de&s;cents from a <HI>Fountain</HI> at the top of the Step; and from thence the water runs in a &s;mall channel cro&s;s the Walk that encompa&s;&s;es the Fountain which I am going to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>This <HI>Fountain</HI> is oblong, or of an Oval figure; its <HI>diameter</HI> is in length twenty Paces, and it is about ten Paces wide. In the middle of this <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> there is a round Rock, of rough Stones, Shells, and Forge|cinders, about a yard above the water. Out of this <HI>Rockwork</HI> there &s;prings a <HI>Jette</HI> about five yards high, from the middle of it; and from the other parts round about this <HI>Rock</HI> there do ri&s;e abundance of other <HI>Spouts.</HI> This <HI>Fountain</HI> is bordered with green Turf, on the Slope of which Border there are placed at due di&s;tances &s;ix <HI>collopt Shells</HI> of wrought Stone. Into all the&s;e <HI>Shells</HI> there is a fall of water from the mouth of a wrought <HI>Head,</HI> joined to the <HI>Shell</HI> in one and the &s;ame Stone; and from four parts of each <HI>Shell</HI> the wa|ter falls into the Ba&s;in of the Fountain, which is not paved at all, the Bottom being only of Earth, as the Border of it and the Slope were of Turf.</P>
<P>Round this <HI>Fountain,</HI> next to the Hedge, and di|rectly behind the fore&s;aid <HI>&s;ix Shells,</HI> there are <HI>&s;ix Sta|tues</HI> in Stone, or &s;o many little <HI>Cupids</HI> &s;tanding upon high Pede&s;tals of wrought Stone; and at the bottom of each Pede&s;tal there is a fall of water into a &s;mall
<PB N="34" REF="23">&s;quare Stone-ba&s;in, from whence the water runs un|der the Walk into one of the <HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Shells</HI> that were before mentioned to be placed on the Slope below the Border. The fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Cupids</HI> is drinking out of a <HI>Stone-cup</HI> held in one hand, and has a <HI>bunch</HI> of <HI>Grapes</HI> in the other. The &s;econd holds a <HI>Tulip</HI> in his Right hand. The third is reading in a <HI>Book,</HI> through a pair of Spectacles, held near the Book. The fourth has a Play-thing in his hand. The fifth has a <HI>Snake,</HI> which he &s;queezes hard in his Arms. And the &s;ixth leans upon a <HI>Spade.</HI> Al&s;o round about this Fountain there are placed fifty <HI>Orange-trees</HI> in Frames.</P>
<P>Going &s;till Northwards about thirty Paces from this Fountain, we come at the end of this Walk to a Statue of <HI>Venus</HI> at length, a little &s;tooping, and holding <HI>Cu|pid</HI> by both hands. The <HI>Venus</HI> is placed on a Stone Pede&s;tal, and out of a wrought Head at the bottom of the Pede&s;tal, there is a fall of water into a &s;mall Stone-ba&s;in.</P>
<P>A little Ea&s;tward of this Statue of <HI>Venus,</HI> there is another <HI>Fountain</HI> in a &s;quare Stone-ba&s;in. In the middle of it there is a &s;mall fall of water from a round Stone-ba&s;in, whence the water does fall equally all round in one &s;heet. And be&s;ides another <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> that is here made out of a <HI>Head</HI> into a large Ba&s;in, there are five other falls of water from out of the Walls of this Foun|tain, each of them about a foot in breadth.</P>

<P>At this Garden-gate, we behold the <HI>Old Hoof</HI> di|rectly before us We&s;tward, but are &s;eparated from it by two <HI>Moats,</HI> between which there are five rows of <HI>Lime-trees;</HI> on the South of which the <HI>Labyrinth</HI> is &s;eated, and on the North the <HI>Fowl Garden,</HI> that is now to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Advancing from the fore&s;aid Gate fifty paces North|wards, we turn to the Gate of the <HI>Fowl Garden</HI> on our left, to which we pa&s;s on a Bridge over the Moat. This Gate is likewi&s;e of wrought Iron, painted Blew and Gilt. Going from this Gate two and twenty paces, we de&s;cend by three Steps to a Noble <HI>Fountain</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> round which <HI>Fountain</HI> from the bottom of the Steps to the Border of its Ba&s;in there is a Walk twelve foot and a half broad, into which Walk there are four de&s;cents by three Steps, four oppo&s;ite ways: And be|tween the one and the other row of Steps there is a Green Slope round the Fountain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> of this <HI>Fountain</HI> is oblong, or oval, and of a great circumference, the <HI>Diameter</HI> at lea&s;t forty paces in length, and about twenty four paces in breadth. It is de&s;igned for the u&s;e of divers &s;orts of
<PB N="36" REF="24"><HI>Fowl;</HI> and there are <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> built on the two &s;ides of this Garden, for &s;heltering the <HI>Fowl.</HI> In the middle of this <HI>Fountain</HI> there is a <HI>Jette,</HI> that throws up the water about twenty foot; and below the <HI>Jette</HI> there is a <HI>tri|ple Ca&s;cade,</HI> made from three round Ba&s;ins, whereof the uppermo&s;t appears to make a &s;heet about a foot in depth, the middle-one near about two foot, and the lowermo&s;t four foot. Between the&s;e three Ba|&s;ins the &s;paces or intervals are filled all round with <HI>Shells,</HI> &amp;c. the which <HI>Shells</HI> are &s;een round them through the Sheets of water that fall from the &s;aid <HI>Ba&s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>On the North and South-&s;ide of this Fountain, &s;ix yards from one of the de&s;cents by three Steps, there are two <HI>Summer Hou&s;es,</HI> the one oppo&s;ite to the other. They are within painted in <HI>fre&s;co</HI> and <HI>bronze,</HI> and have <HI>Cupola</HI>'s over them, painted Blew and Gilded. Into the&s;e <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> we enter by folding Doors, which con&s;i&s;t: of two foot Wain&s;cot from the bottom, the re&s;t in broad Gla&s;s up to the <HI>Cupola.</HI> Each of the&s;e <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> hath four Sha&s;h-windows, be&s;ides the Doors, and hath on each &s;ide of them contiguous to the middlemo&s;t and large&s;t Windows, an <HI>Aviary,</HI> wherein are kept curious Foreign, or Singing Birds. When the Sha&s;h-windows next to the <HI>Aviaries</HI> are opened, there is &s;till a Wire-grate remaining, to hinder the Birds from fly|ing out of their <HI>Aviaries</HI> into the <HI>Summer-hou&s;es.</HI> The&s;e Hou&s;es are paved with white and red Marble, cut in|to curious Figures, but they are bordered all round with black Marble, of half a foot breadth, over which Border there is al&s;o a Ledge of white Marble, between the black, and the Wain&s;cot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aviaries</HI> that adjoin to <HI>Summer-hou&s;es,</HI> are likewi&s;e covered with le&s;&s;er <HI>Cupola</HI>'s of Lead, painted

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Park</HI> is a great &s;pace of Ground contain|ing many Long <HI>Green Walks, Groves, Nur&s;eries: Fountains, Canals, Ca&s;cades,</HI> the <HI>Viver</HI> and divers Corn-fields, within the Pales. So that when His <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> is plea&s;ed to take diver&s;ion at home, there is not wanting Game for <HI>Shooting, Setting,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As we go from the <HI>Fowl-Garden</HI> We&s;twards, we do leave the <HI>Old Hoof</HI> on the the left hand, and at the We&s;t-end of this Garden we come to a large Wire-grate, of the bigne&s;s of a large Gate, on both &s;ides of which Grate we pa&s;s through Doors into the <HI>Park,</HI> and fir&s;t to a <HI>Long Ca|nal,</HI> in the which there are no le&s;s than a hundred and eight <HI>Spouts,</HI> half on one &s;ide, and the other half on t'other &s;ide of the <HI>Canal.</HI> They throw the water above four foot high, and the water of every <HI>Spout</HI> is made to fall on the contrary &s;ide of the <HI>Canal.</HI> This <HI>Canal</HI> is about &s;ix foot broad, and the di&s;tance between every one of the <HI>Spouts</HI> is five foot, &s;o as that between eve|ry two on the &s;ame &s;ide there are ten foot di&s;tance.
<PB N="39" REF="25">At the beginning and end of the <HI>Canal,</HI> there are pla|ced two <HI>Spouts</HI> falling the one upon the place of the other; but all the re&s;t do fall on the contrary &s;ide, and di&s;tant from the oppo&s;ite Spouts, the whole length of the <HI>Canal.</HI> All the&s;e <HI>Spouts</HI> do fall into the figure of an Arch.</P>
<P>This <HI>Canal</HI> reaches from the Gate of the <HI>Fowl-Gar|den</HI> already de&s;cribed, unto a <HI>Great Ca&s;cade</HI> that will be pre&s;ently mentioned; it has Hedges on each &s;ide five yards high; and on the farther &s;ide of the Hedge South of the <HI>Canal,</HI> has a &s;tately Grove of tall Trees, and Northwards of it has all along a Nur&s;ery of young ones. About half way, the Walk on each &s;ide between the Hedge and the Border of the <HI>Canal</HI> is about five foot broad, but the other half way, next the <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> the Walk is widened unto fifteen foot on both &s;ides. The <HI>Canal</HI> is Bordered with Green Turf, and has a Slope of the &s;ame from the Border down to the water.</P>
<P>About the middle of this <HI>Canal,</HI> on the South-&s;ide, there is placed a Marble Statue of a <HI>Flora</HI> at length, on a high Stone Pede&s;tal; and on each &s;ide of the <HI>Flora</HI> there is al&s;o a Head; the which Statue and Heads are &s;een as at the end of a long Green Walk North of the <HI>Canal,</HI> the which Walk is a hundred and &s;eventy paces, to go from the <HI>Canal</HI> unto the Fountain of <HI>Faunus,</HI> that will &s;oon be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of this <HI>Long Canal,</HI> we come to a mo&s;t Noble Fabrick of wrought Stone, or to the <HI>Ca&s;|cade</HI> of the <HI>Fi&s;hers,</HI> &s;ometimes al&s;o called the Cypher Fountain. It is joined to the &s;ide of one of the Walks about the <HI>Viver;</HI> it has Balli&s;ters at the top of the Fabrick, and joining to the Walk above; and there are covered Flowerpots upon the Balli&s;ters. On each &s;ide of
<PB N="40" REF="26">this <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> there are two &s;everal a&s;cents by Stone-&s;teps. And fir&s;t we come to four Steps, on the corners of which there are placed two little <HI>Dragons,</HI> out of who&s;e mouths the water falls into two &s;collopt Stone Ba&s;ins at the bottom, under the <HI>Dragons.</HI> From the&s;e four Steps on both &s;ides, we cro&s;s over other <HI>Canals</HI> by a Stone-bridge, and then come to eleven Stone|&s;teps more. The&s;e <HI>Canals</HI> do &s;erve to carry away good part of the water that makes this <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> and the re&s;t of it runs into the <HI>Long Canal,</HI> ju&s;t now de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In the middle of this <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> below the Balli&s;ters, there are four little <HI>Boys</HI> a <HI>fi&s;hing,</HI> and drawing a Nett full of Fi&s;h; the four little <HI>Boys</HI> are of Stone, with leaden Net-work coloured like Stone, in their Arms; and through a great deal of this Net-work placed between the <HI>Boys,</HI> the water falls into the a large wrought <HI>Ba&s;in,</HI> and from this <HI>Ba&s;in</HI> the water falls again in five &s;everal places between other Net-work. Two of the&s;e falls of water from the &s;aid Ba&s;in are made into a Stone <HI>Canal</HI> below, that runs along the &s;ide of the Wall, under the Stone Bridges into the <HI>Canals</HI> on the North and South &s;ides of the <HI>Ca&s;cade.</HI> The three other falls are thence made fir&s;t upon Rockwork, and from thence into a common or general Ba&s;in that receives the water afore&s;aid, be&s;ides what comes from the <HI>Spouts,</HI> and <HI>Bell,</HI> that will be pre&s;ently mentioned.</P>
<P>Moreover, into the &s;aid <HI>Canal</HI> that runs along the &s;ide of the Wall of this <HI>Ca&s;acade,</HI> there are four other falls of water, whereof the two outward are from two <HI>Heads</HI> of Stone, the two inward from two <HI>Heads</HI> of Marble, placed at due di&s;tances in the Wall afore&s;aid. The water from the Heads of Stone falls directly into the <HI>Canal,</HI> but from the Heads of <HI>Marble</HI> it falls into Stone-ba&s;ins, that are about a yard in front, and from
<PB N="41" REF="26">them the &s;heet of water falls into the &s;aid <HI>Canal.</HI> Be|&s;ides, out of the lower Wall of this <HI>Canal</HI> there are two other falls out of two more <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Marble</HI> into two other Stone-ba&s;ins of the &s;ame bigne&s;s with the former, and directly under tho&s;e <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Marble</HI> and Ba&s;ins, that were before mentioned to be placed in the upper Wall of the Canal, or the Side-wall of the <HI>Ca&s;|cade.</HI> And from the&s;e two Ba&s;ins the &s;heets of water of fall into the general Ba&s;in at bottom.</P>
<P>In the middle of the common Ba&s;in there is a large inverted <HI>Bell</HI> of water, near two yards high, and the <HI>diameter</HI> of its <HI>ba&s;is</HI> on the top &s;eems to be much about two yards likewi&s;e. About this <HI>Bell</HI> there do ari&s;e twelve Spouts which throw up the water about eight foot. On the North and South &s;ides of the Ba&s;in, wherein were the &s;aid <HI>Great Bell,</HI> adn the twelve Spouts, there are other <HI>le&s;&s;er Bells</HI> of water inverted, on each &s;ide one. The&s;e do ri&s;e about a foot high, and the <HI>diameter</HI> of them at the top is much the &s;ame. The <HI>common Ba&s;in</HI> below the <HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> is bordered with a broad Stone of &s;ixteen inches breadth, and walled with Rock|work; and the whole &s;pace between the &s;aid Border, and the <HI>Long Canal</HI> before de&s;cribed, as well as to the Stone|&s;tairs on either &s;ide of this <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> is taken up chiefly with little Stone-Canals of &s;even inches breadth, their Border but two inches. But in the intervals between tho&s;e little <HI>Canals</HI> the &s;pace is paved with white and black Pebbles in divers Figures. From the two <HI>le&s;&s;er Bells</HI> the water does run along tho&s;e little <HI>Canals,</HI> which be&s;ides the flouri&s;h they do make on each &s;ide, do form the Letters <HI>R. W. M. R.</HI> And above tho&s;e Let|ters the &s;aid &s;mall <HI>Canals</HI> are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as to form the repre&s;entation of a <HI>Crown.</HI> Moreover, from among the&s;e Pebbles, with which all the intervals between the
<PB N="42" REF="27">little <HI>Canals</HI> are paved, there are made to ri&s;e, when 'tis thought fit, by the turning of two <HI>&s;Cocks,</HI> about four&s;core the mo&s;t minute Spouts that can be con|ceived. They are like a &s;hower of &s;mall rain, ar|ti&s;icially made in a certain order. One half of the four&s;core is made to play by the turning of one <HI>Cock,</HI> and the t'other half by turning the other. And the&s;e <HI>Cocks</HI> are turned in the Walk above the <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> or between it and the <HI>Viver.</HI> Every one of the&s;e little <HI>Spouts</HI> plays about a yard high, and the Pipe of every one of them is covered with a &s;mall Copper Cover, that has five little holes through which the water does ri&s;e in five &s;mall branches, like to a very &s;mall &s;hower of Rain. Some of the Covers of the&s;e Pipes are half an inch, others are three quarters of an inch diameter. But in &s;hort, they do make a very plea&s;ant and agreeable &s;ight, when|ever they are made to play: And they are intended to divert the Spectators, by cau&s;ing a &s;mall Rain un|awares on tho&s;e who &s;hall advance within the compa&s;s of their reach.</P>
<P>I did before mention two pair of Stone-&s;teps, the one of four, the other of eleven Steps on the North and South &s;ides of this <HI>Ca&s;cade.</HI> From the two &s;ides of the lowermo&s;t, or lea&s;t pair of Steps, where the little <HI>Dragons</HI> were &s;aid to be placed, there are conti|nued from the Steps on one &s;ide to the Steps on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> all round this &s;pace (which was &s;aid to be paved with Pebbles, and to con&s;i&s;t of the &s;ore&s;aid Stone <HI>Canals</HI>) two <HI>circles</HI> of <HI>Stone</HI> of fourteen inches, breadth, which do &s;erve in&s;tead of a <HI>double Bor|der</HI> to the whole; the two <HI>Borders</HI> keeping the &s;ame di&s;tance from one another throughout, as the Steps do make in front, or breadth.</P>

<P>When we are up the &s;econd pair of Stairs of eleven Steps, we enter upon a Walk, that encompa&s;&s;es a large <HI>Quadrangular Pond,</HI> called the <HI>Viver,</HI> being the common Storehou&s;e of the <HI>Water</HI> that &s;upplies &s;o many of the&s;e <HI>Fountains, Ca&s;cades,</HI> and <HI>Canals.</HI> The Walk on the four &s;ides of the <HI>Viver</HI> is &s;even yards broad; it is a Gravelled Walk; and on the &s;ide next to the water it is adorned with <HI>Juniper-trees</HI> two yards high, adn &s;ix yards di&s;tance from one another; and on the other &s;ide of it has <HI>Lime-trees</HI> at the &s;ame di&s;tance, be&s;ides large round Bu&s;hes between the <HI>Lime-trees.</HI> The <HI>Viver</HI> is a hundred and forty paces long, and three&s;core and ten paces broad. It is bordered with green, and has a green <HI>Slope</HI> from the Border down to the water.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-end of the <HI>Viver,</HI> in the middle of the Walk, we do pa&s;s through another Gate, the Bars partly Gilt, and partly Blew, into a long &s;hady <HI>Grove,</HI> u&s;ually called the <HI>Queen's Grove,</HI> wherein there are divers Walks, &s;ome near unto <HI>Brooks</HI> of a clear running water, others at &s;ome di&s;tance from the <HI>Brooks,</HI> and all of them as &s;olitary and retired, as can well be imagined. This Grove is of a good extent, and in the Summer-time very delightful.</P>
<P>And now before we end, let us return unto the Ea&s;t-gate of the <HI>Fowl-Garden,</HI> from whence we may enter North-we&s;t into a long Walk between high Trees, there being a <HI>Grove</HI> on each &s;ide beyond the rows of Trees. In this Walk, when we have gone about two hundred and twenty paces, and there cro&s;s'd another long green Walk, towards the middle of this Walk, where the <HI>Groves</HI> do end, we do at length come to the Fountain of <HI>Faunus,</HI> who&s;e Ba&s;in is round, and about fifty &s;even foot <HI>diameter.</HI> In the middle of this <HI>Fountain</HI> there is crected the Statue of <HI>Faunus</HI> in Stone at length, with an <HI>Infant</HI> in his Arms, and a <HI>Goat</HI> at
<PB N="44" REF="28">his Feet to &s;uckle the <HI>Infant.</HI> This Statue of <HI>Faunus</HI> does lean upon a Stone <HI>Pillar,</HI> and &s;tands upon a high <HI>Pede&s;tal</HI> of a Blew Stone, placed in the mid&s;t of a Rock, con&s;i&s;ting of many rough Stones, petrified Earth of divers colours, and large Shells here and there inter|mixed. From about this Rockwork there are made &s;ix double &s;heets of water, whereof each double fall is over|again&s;t a &s;everal Walk. For from this <HI>Fountain</HI> there are &s;ix di&s;tinct <HI>Walks,</HI> one oppo&s;ite to another. And round about it, between each of the <HI>&s;ix Walks,</HI> near the corners of the <HI>Walks,</HI> there are placed two <HI>Statues</HI> in half-length of the <HI>Termini,</HI> or Gods of Boundaries, twelve in all; &s;ome of which twelve <HI>Statues</HI> have the face of a <HI>Man,</HI> and &s;ome of a <HI>Satyr;</HI> and they are placed upon Pede|&s;tals two yards high. All the&s;e <HI>Walks</HI> are twenty two, or twenty four foot broad; they are green in the mid|dle, and on each &s;ide of the Green they are plain Earth ungravelled, according to the <HI>Dutch</HI> cu&s;tom, to about four foot and a half breadth on each &s;ide of the Green. The <HI>Hedges</HI> of all the&s;e Walks do con&s;i&s;t of Trees both great and &s;mall, planted clo&s;e together. Here are al&s;o other hand&s;ome <HI>long Walks</HI> in the Park, that are not men|tioned; be&s;ides <HI>Brooks,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hponds</HI> within the <HI>Grove</HI> on the &s;ides of the <HI>Long Canal.</HI></P>
<P>There is one thing more very remarkable in the&s;e many <HI>Fountains</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;cades</HI> that have been de&s;cribed; as that they are &s;upplied with a natural conveyance of water that does con&s;tantly run, and is not forc'd up with <HI>Engines</HI> into great <HI>Ci&s;terns,</HI> where it mu&s;t &s;oon corrupt and &s;tink, if not quickly di&s;charged. Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that the famous <HI>Water-works</HI> at <HI>Ver|&s;ailles</HI> have in this regard a very great di&s;advantage and inconvenience, becau&s;e they &s;oon contract corruption, and after they are forc'd to play, are found to cau&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="28">an <HI>ill &s;tench</HI> in the <HI>Gardens.</HI> Whereas at <HI>Loo</HI> the water is always &s;weet, and there is no need of Commands, or Preparations for a day or two before, in order to make it run.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Gradens</HI> in the whole are a Work of wonder|ful <HI>Magni&s;icence,</HI> mo&s;t worthy of &s;o <HI>Great</HI> a <HI>Monarch;</HI> a Work of prodigious expence, infinite variety, and cu|rio&s;ity; and after nine years labour by abundance of Workmen they were &s;ome years ago intirely fini&s;hed, and brought to perfection in all re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here conclude this De&s;cription, if I did not judge it it may be acceptable to give a &s;hort account of &s;ix <HI>Vivers,</HI> or Fi&s;h-ponds, which His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> has cau&s;ed to be made in the <HI>Heath,</HI> beyond the <HI>Gardens.</HI> When I was at <HI>Loo,</HI> two years &s;ince, there were about two hundred Per&s;ons imployed in the making the &s;aid <HI>Vivers,</HI> which are &s;ince fini&s;hed. They are &s;ituated on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of that Walk which is continued from the end of the <HI>Upper Garden,</HI> between <HI>Lime-trees,</HI> un|to a <HI>Pyramid</HI> that is crected half a mile off in the <HI>Heath.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Vivers</HI> is about twenty yards di|&s;tant from the <HI>Lime-trees,</HI> and is eight hundred and forty foot, or two hundred and eighty yards in length. And it is two hundred and forty foot, or four&s;core yards in breadth.</P>
<P>All the <HI>&s;ix Vivers</HI> do lye Ea&s;tward of one another, and the water is conveyed from one to another, after the manner as in the <HI>Fi&s;t-ponds</HI> in <HI>Hide-park.</HI> To the fir&s;t there is made a &s;ubterrancan Pa&s;&s;age, built of Brick, from the Canal that runs at the North-end of the <HI>Great Garden,</HI> by the which Pa&s;&s;age the water is brought into the fir&s;t <HI>Viver,</HI> and from that let into the others.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="29">
<P>The &s;econd <HI>Viver</HI> is in length &s;ix hundred and twelve foot, or two hundred and four yards; and it is two hundred and forty foot, or four&s;core yards broad.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Viver</HI> is four hundred forty four foot, or a hundred forty eight yards long; and of the &s;ame breadth with the two former.</P>
<P>The fourth, &s;ifth, and &s;ixth <HI>Vivers,</HI> are all of the &s;ame length, that is, three hundred ninety &s;ix foot, or one hundred thirty two yards long; and they are all three of the &s;ame breadth, that is, four hundred forty four foot, or one hundred forty eight yards.</P>
<P>The length of the three fir&s;t <HI>Vivers</HI> is extended <HI>Northwards,</HI> but that of the three latter is made <HI>Ea&s;t|ward;</HI> the &s;ituation of the ground, wherein they are made, requiring this alteration. For on the North|&s;ide the <HI>Heath</HI> has a ri&s;ing a&s;cent, which makes this alteration of the dimen&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary. Between the <HI>Vivers</HI> and this ri&s;ing-ground there is room enough for receiving the water that &s;hall at any time be emptied out of them, in order to fill them with fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>They are not made above &s;ix foot deep, and the Earth that is dug out of them does &s;erve to make the <HI>Banks</HI> round about them; the which <HI>Banks</HI> being rai&s;|ed three foot above the <HI>Vivers,</HI> does occa&s;ion that their depth is but three foot more. The <HI>Banks</HI> that &s;urround all the <HI>&s;ix Vivers</HI> are twenty four foot broad, and on tho&s;e <HI>Banks</HI> which &s;o encompa&s;s them, there is made a plea&s;ant Walk, adorned with <HI>Willows</HI> the whole circumference. But the <HI>Banks</HI> which &s;erve to &s;eparate them from one another, are but eighteen foot broad. The&s;e <HI>Vivers</HI> are provided for the &s;up|plying different &s;orts of <HI>Fi&s;h;</HI> and are now fini&s;hed

<HEAD>A Short Account of <HI>HOLLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing De&s;cription I have given the Reader a moderate comprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e famous <HI>Gar|dens;</HI> the <HI>fini&s;hing</HI> of which &s;o nobly, and with that great variety, is the more to be Admired, becau&s;e it was done <HI>during the late War,</HI> when all things were at &s;take, and the event was feared &s;o much by mo&s;t men. And although things were not indeed in that danger from the <HI>French,</HI> as the <HI>Roman State</HI> was, when <HI>Hannibal</HI> was at the Gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet it puts me in mind of a Brave Action of that Great People, who, whil&s;t <HI>Hannibal</HI> was ju&s;t under their Walls with his Army, and &s;ome of the <HI>Fields</HI> whereon he was Incamped, happening to be then expo&s;ed to <HI>Publick Sale,</HI> were no de&s;titute of Purcha&s;ers of the Magnanimity, who at that very time gave even the Market Price for an E&s;tate then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Greate&s;t and mo&s;t Deadly Enemy that ever threatned that <HI>Republick,</HI> from the fir&s;t <HI>Founding</HI> of the <HI>City.</HI></P>
<P>And this is the more remarkable, becau&s;e the <HI>French King,</HI> at the breaking out of this War, though his Cof|fers were then full of an inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure, as 'twas thought; and though he had an inclination to Magain|cent Buildings beyond all his Predece&s;&s;ors, yet he imme|diately Ordered a <HI>full &s;top</HI> to be put to all his <HI>Publick Works:</HI> Well fore&s;eeing what a terrible Storm he had brought upon his Kingdom, and with how <HI>Great a Ge|neral</HI> he was like to contend. In&s;omuch that this <HI>Grand Monarch,</HI> who was often &s;aid to give <HI>Peace</HI> to <HI>Europe,</HI> out
<PB N="50" REF="31">of a certain peculiar Genero&s;ity, when he had on a &s;ud|den &s;natcht away from his Neighbours one Province after another, and his <HI>Slow Enemies</HI> had begun to form their Forces; this <HI>Monarch,</HI> I &s;ay, was by the late long and Expen&s;ive <HI>War,</HI> by the firmne&s;s of the <HI>Confederate Union,</HI> and by the pro&s;pect of a <HI>Peace</HI> with the <HI>Turks,</HI> brought to &s;uch Fears and Apprehen&s;ions, that he <HI>Purcha&s;ed</HI> a <HI>Peace</HI> with a &s;trange and &s;urprizing di&s;membring his Great <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and by the Surrendring an incredible number of large and rich <HI>Provinces,</HI> and many <HI>Forts</HI> and <HI>Strong Towns</HI> that were thought to be <HI>Impregnable.</HI></P>
<P>An &s;ince there is &s;o near a proximity between <HI>Loo</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> I cannot here omit to &s;ay &s;omewhat of that <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;iderable People,</HI> among whom the&s;e <HI>Gar|dens</HI> are to be &s;een. But this Subject having been ex|cellently well performed, if not in a manner exhau&s;ted, by one of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of our <HI>English Pens,</HI> who has joined to|gether the <HI>Scholar</HI> and the <HI>Gentleman</HI> in his Writings, as well as any of our Modern Authors; and particularly in his late <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> upon <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Modern Learning,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hall therefore refer my Reader to Sir <HI>William Temple's</HI> Curious <HI>Ob&s;ervatios</HI> upon the <HI>United Provinces</HI> of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> for a more di&s;tinct and full knowledge of this Great Subject; and yet however I will not pa&s;s it by altogether in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Belgae,</HI> or the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> were for their Va|lour and Courage eminent above other People, even in the time of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who at the beginning of his <HI>Commentaries, de Bello Gallico,</HI> has the&s;e words. <HI>Horum omnium forti&s;&s;imi &s;unt Belgae.</HI> When <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had divided <HI>Gaul</HI> into three Parts, he &s;ays the Stoute&s;t and mo&s;t Cou|ragious of them all, were the <HI>Belgae,</HI> or <HI>Low Countrymen,</HI> then called <HI>Gallica Belgica,</HI> and &s;ince divided into <HI>Seven|teen Provinces</HI> under the Dominion of the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> until <HI>William</HI> the Wi&s;e and Valiant <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="31">fir&s;t re&s;cued, and the Invincible <HI>Prince Maurice</HI> of <HI>Na&s;|&s;aw,</HI> by abundance of Victories, and Sieges, compleated the Peace of, <HI>Seven</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Provinces,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed them in a <HI>Free Republick,</HI> on the 9th of <HI>April,</HI> 1609.

That <HI>Providence,</HI> which certainly counducts and over-rules the Affairs of the World, &s;ets bounds to <HI>Empires,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Sea.</HI> But to proceed, We have had, in the late War, &s;ufficent experience of the Fortitude and Valour of the <HI>Provinces</HI> now mentioned. For what <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> have done their duty, or fought better upon occa&s;ion that the <HI>Walloons,</HI> &s;o mi&s;erable to look up|on, u&s;ually called the <HI>Spani&s;h Hor&s;e,</HI> though Natives of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Brabant?</HI> Or what <HI>Foot</HI> have done better &s;ervice in the late War than the <HI>Dutch,</HI> either in Sieges, or in Battels?</P>
<P>For if I were to &s;peak of the <HI>Engli&s;h Soldiery,</HI> or were askt which were the <HI>be&s;t Soldiers,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> or the <HI>Bel|gae,</HI> I &s;should an&s;wer, the <HI>Englis&s;h,</HI> as <HI>Sir Walter Rawleigh</HI> did, when putting the que&s;tion, in his book of the World, which were the brave&s;t Soldiers, the <HI>Roman,</HI> or the <HI>Gre|cian,</HI> made an&s;wer the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> who, if they were in his time of &s;uch account and e&s;teem, when only a <HI>Queen,</HI> though &s;he indeed a mo&s;t Excellent one, &s;ate on the Throne, and le&s;t her Armies to the Conduct of her <HI>Ge|ner<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">is:</HI> What admiration ought now to be had of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when they have our <HI>Pre&s;ent King</HI> at the <HI>Head</HI> of them!

<PB N="52" REF="32">
<P>And we may have &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt, whether <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> had a better Army, or better Sol|diers, even of his <HI>Grecians,</HI> with which it was his good fortune to <HI>Conquer the World</HI> before him, and the which he led &s;o boldly and bravely again&s;t a great concour&s;e of <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who were a weak and e&s;&s;eminate People; than our <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Third,</HI> or <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Fifth,</HI> conducted again&s;t <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, that was always e&s;teemed a Warlike People, and was long ago adjudg'd &s;uch by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> him&s;elf, by his own Experience, after he had <HI>Conquer'd</HI> them, and the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> Tho&s;e two famous <HI>Engli&s;h Kings,</HI> I &s;ay, did &s;ufficiently mani&s;e&s;t the <HI>Superiority</HI> of <HI>Engli&s;h Armies</HI> to all others, upon better trials than with <HI>Per&s;i|ans,</HI> when they had <HI>Kings</HI> at their <HI>Head, like</HI> to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> to <HI>conduct</HI> them.</P>
<P>The knowledge of this Truth, made the late Re|nowned and Excellent General <HI>Turenne,</HI> &s;o much to co|vet <HI>Engli&s;h Soldiers</HI> before all others, and even before his own Countrymen, in the <HI>Armies</HI> he Commanded. And this made him &s;o de&s;irous of the Honour, to be called Father of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when he was their Friend and Pro|rector.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Demon&s;tration we have had of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> un|daunted Courage, was lately before <HI>Namur,</HI> where in the fir&s;t <HI>Attack</HI> that was made, the <HI>Engli&s;h Red-Coats</HI> &s;truck &s;uch a Terror on the <HI>French,</HI> by an unparalel'd Brave|ry, that they were never able to recover them&s;elves from the fright, during the Siege. And when the Town was forced to Surrender, and the <HI>King</HI> then Ordered away all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the Succour of <HI>Prince Vandemont,</HI> after the <HI>famous Retreat</HI> he had made, and to Pre&s;erve <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> from falling into the hands of <HI>Villeroy,</HI> at the time he Bombarded it; the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as I have heard, begg'd of His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> the detaining <HI>four Engli&s;h Battalions</HI> towards carrying on the <HI>Siege</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> and <HI>Forts</HI> ad|joining

<P>And of how great weight and force to the animating a People, or Army, the <HI>genius</HI> of a <HI>Good General</HI> is, may be evinced, by that di&s;mal <HI>Revolution,</HI> which happened to the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in the Year 1672.

And now the <HI>Pen&s;ionary</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI> Con&s;ulting two or two three days with the <HI>Stadtholder,</HI> does bring matters of the greate&s;t moment to a &s;horter i&s;&s;ue, than can be ea&s;ily expected from the different Senti|ments
<PB N="55" REF="33">of a great number of Coun&s;ellors, though never &s;o Wi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Holland</HI> does contain a greater number of large, popu|lous, and con&s;iderable Towns, than po&s;&s;ibly are to be found &s;o near together in any other part of the Univer&s;e. But though it abounds with multitudes of Inhabitants, and is enriched with &s;o many great Towns, &s;uch as <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> the <HI>Hague, Leyden, Dort, Delf, Rotterdam, Haer|lem,</HI> the <HI>Briel,</HI> &amp;c. and others, as remarkable as the Chief Cities in other Countries, yet it yields to their &s;u|&s;tenance little or no product of <HI>Corn</HI> or <HI>Grain.</HI> They are &s;ain to fetch from the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and other Places, where it is plentiful, <HI>Corn</HI> enough to &s;upply them&s;elves, and their Neighbours, who want it. And they do &s;end out great <HI>Fleets</HI> every year for that purpo&s;e. All this Coun|try is a <HI>low level,</HI> lower tan the <HI>Sea</HI> it &s;elf in many places, and defended from the inundation of the Sea by incredible <HI>Dykes,</HI> or <HI>Banks.</HI> All the <HI>&s;eventeen Provinces</HI> are commonly called the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> no that they are all a <HI>Low level</HI> like unto <HI>Holland,</HI> but becau&s;e they are &s;ituated towards the <HI>Lower</HI> part of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and therefore are now called by Authors <HI>Germania inferior,</HI> or Lower <HI>Germany.</HI> The Country of <HI>Holland</HI> is excel|lent for <HI>Pa&s;ture,</HI> and cultivated to the be&s;t advantage by mighty labour and indu&s;try of the Inhabitants. They have cut large <HI>Canals</HI> through all parts of the Country, by means of which they do go commodiou&s;ly and plea|&s;antly from Town to Town, at a regulated ea&s;y expence, in cleanly and large Ve&s;&s;els, covered from the Weather, which &s;et out con&s;tantly at certain hours, whether the Pa&s;&s;engers are many or few, &s;o &s;oon as a <HI>Bell</HI> has done ringing. And by means of the &s;aid <HI>Canals,</HI> they do en|rich, and water their Grounds at plea&s;ure, and by Wind|mills they do throw out the water again, as they judge convenient. As we travel along the&s;e <HI>Canals,</HI> it is de|lightful
<PB N="56" REF="34">to &s;ee &s;o many Noble <HI>Country Hou&s;es,</HI> bordering upon them, and adorned with near <HI>Gardens,</HI> within &s;ight of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Pa&s;&s;engers. The <HI>water</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Canals</HI> is not offen|&s;ive to the &s;mell, even in the Summer time, although generally they are a Standing water. Po&s;&s;ibly the great number of <HI>Boats</HI> that are continually plying to and fro, and drawn by Hor&s;es upon the trot, do keep the water in that agitation, that it has not time to putrify, and grow offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>If this <HI>Low Country</HI> wants any thing, it is that <HI>variety</HI> of different Objects, which we do enjoy &s;o much here in <HI>England;</HI> and the which <HI>Variety</HI> is &s;o acceptable and agreable to the nature of Mankind, who do all, and in every thing, con&s;i&s;t of Variety, as in <HI>Languages, Voices, Per&s;ons, Countenances, Ge&s;tures, Hand-writing, Cloaths, Appetites, Gu&s;toes,</HI> and what not. For what can con|tribute &s;o much to the e&s;tabli&s;hing our Healths, when declining into a Con&s;umptive &s;tate, as Variety even of Country-Air? Or to what end has <HI>Providence</HI> made that <HI>in&s;inite</HI> Provi&s;ion of Fle&s;h, and Fi&s;h, and all other Su&s;te|nance, if not to plea&s;e and gratify the different Appetites of men? And I am mightily mi&s;taken, if even in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> too, the con&s;tant, long continuance of the <HI>&s;ame Medi|cines</HI> will have that good effect on abundance of Con&s;ti|tutions in Chronical Ca&s;es, as a Change, and Variety, and <HI>Alteration of Medicines.</HI></P>
<P>But to return; there is little of our <HI>Variety</HI> to be &s;een in <HI>Holland.</HI> In travelling from place to place we do eve|ry where &s;ee the &s;ame &s;ort of <HI>Country</HI> again and again. One Hou&s;e that we look upon may differ in dimen&s;ions, or other circum&s;tances from another Hou&s;e; but the <HI>Countrey</HI> in one place has the &s;ame A&s;pect and Re&s;em|blance to that in another, as an Egg is like to an Egg. So that after our fir&s;t Curio&s;ity is rea&s;onably well &s;ati&s;|fied, our Entertainment in the Boats is commonly a
<PB N="57" REF="34">Book, or viewing the mixt Company, or &s;ometimes Di&s;cour&s;e of I know not what, to pa&s;s away the time.</P>
<P>He that would &s;ee kind of <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> in this Country, mu&s;t go by Land from <HI>Dort</HI> one League towards <HI>Breda;</HI> and there he will &s;ee all the way a Country &s;o adorned with fine Hou&s;es, and fine Gardens, and with that va|riety of Trees, planted in good order, and on all &s;ides, that he will not know which way to ca&s;t his Eye fir&s;t, &s;o many Objects will invite him. Perhaps he will find him|&s;elf di&s;tracted with as much diverting <HI>variety,</HI> as a young Gentleman or Lady is wont to be, when they fir&s;t come out of the Country, and take the diver&s;ion of the <HI>Ring</HI> in <HI>Hidepark</HI> in good Weather, on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening, when the Town is full. I need not de&s;cribe the Charms, the Lu&s;tre, the Atractions of <HI>Living Objects</HI> there, Ori|ginals in the greate&s;t perfection that Nature ever drew, and &s;uch Ma&s;terpieces of Man and Womankind, as nei|ther <HI>Italy</HI> it &s;elf, nor all the World perhaps, can equal, or &s;hew the like, as in this our <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of <HI>Women,</HI> as <HI>England</HI> has been often and ju&s;tly called; nor need I hint how the Eyes of young Comers do there nimbly rowl about, not without pain &s;ometimes, and even danger of Di&s;tortion.</P>

It is indeed a very &s;trong <HI>Frontier,</HI> and hard to be attempted; and therefore the <HI>French,</HI> when they made their memorable Inroad on the&s;e <HI>Provinces</HI> in the Year 1672. thought it more advi&s;eable to hazard the difficult pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Rhine</HI> it &s;elf, by &s;wimming one of the great|e&s;t Rivers of <HI>Europe,</HI> than to make its Attack upon any part of this large Frontier, where the Towns were &s;o &s;trong, and Forrage would have been &s;o &s;carce.</P>

<P>I was never in <HI>Frie&s;eland,</HI> nor <HI>Groningen,</HI> and therefore &s;hall &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e Parts.

<P>It is now twenty years &s;ince I was in <HI>Zealand,</HI> having been then &s;ent to <HI>Ulu&s;&s;ing</HI> to &s;ee a &s;ick Gentleman; whom after I had, through God's Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;oon put into a &s;tate of &s;a&s;ety, I went to &s;ee <HI>Middleburgh:</HI> and going thither upon a high Cau&s;eway, and looking down upon the Country, I could not but think it anciently belonged to the Dominion of the <HI>Sea,</HI> from whence it has therefore properly its name of <HI>Zealand.</HI> They are Towns of great: Trade, and Ships of the greate&s;t Burthen, or Force, do ride in deep Canals, in the middle of the Streets of <HI>Ulu&s;&s;ing,</HI> as well as in &s;ome parts of <HI>Middleburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Great <HI>Geographers</HI> may indeed write learnedly of all the World, though they never were out of the Country they were born in; nor ever hazarded their Per&s;ons, by
<PB N="59" REF="35">dangerous Travels, in order to form their Notions, or Experience, Yet I &s;hall give but a &s;hort and &s;lender Account of my Ob&s;ervations in the&s;e Provinces, becau&s;e my <HI>Travels</HI> here have been none of the greate&s;t.

<P><HI>Travelling</HI> abroad is certainly of &s;ingular u&s;e to the ac|compli&s;hing a Gentleman. It enlarges all his Faculties, and takes off that narrowne&s;s or littlene&s;s of mind, which for want of knowing the World, is apt to &s;owre his Tem|per and Conver&s;ation. It makes men have ju&s;t, and kind, and charitable Ideas of Mankind; and though many of our Gentlemen have &s;o great natural Endowments, and have be&s;ides &s;uch advantages above Foreigners, by their Education in our own Unver&s;ities, that they do not &s;eem to want either this, or any other Improvement; yet <HI>Tra|velling</HI> will, as it were, poli&s;h even a Diamond, take off its Roughne&s;, and give it a new Lu&s;tre.

<P>A <HI>Traveller</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Country mu&s;t be ea&s;y, and obliging in his Carriage, mu&s;t make no noi&s;e, and but little di|&s;pute about his Reckonings; and then he will &s;eldom have ju&s;t cau&s;e of <HI>COmplaints.</HI> He mu&s;t be contented with what he finds upon the &s;pot, and mu&s;t take care to

The more he appears a <HI>Man of Quality,</HI> the more he mu&s;t expect &s;ometimes to pay for it; but in the general, if he be pru|dent, and of a quiet peaceable Temper, he will Travel in <HI>this</HI> Country with as much frugality and fair dealing, as he can in any other, notwith&s;tanding the Clamors which have &s;ometimes been made through the indi&s;cre|tion of Stranger.</P>
<P><HI>Great Taxes</HI> are here &s;u&s;&s;ered patiently, and without murmuring, for the &s;ake of the <HI>Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> they enjoy. They are all laid as <HI>equally</HI> as po&s;&s;ible; and he that can invent a <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;y Tax,</HI> that will not be Grievous to the People, &s;hall be &s;ure not to fail of a Publick Reward. Whatever is &s;aid of <HI>Laws, their Taxes</HI> are not like <HI>Cobwebs,</HI> in which the le&s;&s;er Flies are u&s;ually catch'd, whil&s;t the greater break through and e&s;cape. The inferior People, and the Rich, do pay to a Penny the &s;ame Pound-rate, in proportion to their Abilities. No body there thinks it their <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> (or at lea&s;t it was ne|ver practi&s;ed) to promote <HI>Unequal,</HI> or <HI>Unea&s;y Taxes,</HI> that &s;hall cru&s;h one part with an in&s;upporatble burthen, and leave other parts free from feeling the weight. And their <HI>Exci&s;es,</HI> although they reach almo&s;t every thing imagi|nable, are but little felt bythe generality, or cau&s;e but few Complaints, by rea&s;on that all do &s;hare alike in the payments, according to their con&s;umption; and that they reach the Luxurious and Expen&s;ive, more than the Poor, or Frugal People. Their having but one <HI>Fle&s;h|Market,</HI> and one <HI>Fi&s;h-Market,</HI> &amp;c. in a large Town, ren|ders the Collection al&s;o ea&s;y and certain.</P>
<P><HI>Fu&s;tice</HI> is &s;o well di&s;tributed among them, and &s;everely executed, that many do think a Traveller may with more Safety pa&s;s through all the <HI>&s;even Provinces</HI> with his <HI>Pur&s;e in his hand,</HI> by Day and by Night, than go ten miles out of <HI>London</HI> with Money in his Pocket.

And this I ob&s;erved at a time, when there was never a more general occa&s;ion of u&s;ing the <HI>Bark,</HI> and when the u&s;e of it was never more proper or effectual; I mean, in the <HI>two fir&s;t Campaigns</HI> that I had the Honour to wait upon His <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> being the Years 1693, and 1694. <HI>Agues</HI> were at that time very <HI>Epidemi|cal;</HI> and the <HI>Continued Fevers</HI> had &s;uch remarkable <HI>Remi&s;&s;ions,</HI> that they were Cured with as much <HI>Certainty,</HI> if not <HI>Speed</HI> too, by the <HI>Bark,</HI> as the <HI>Agues</HI> the&s;elves, provided that proper <HI>Evacuations</HI> did precede its exhibi|tion. And I have rea&s;on to &s;ay <HI>with Speed;</HI> for I was then &s;eldom obliged to make above three or four Vi&s;its, even in tho&s;e <HI>Fevers.</HI> And by rea&s;on of the <HI>Bark's</HI> &s;o well agreeing with the <HI>Fevers</HI> at that time, as well as the <HI>Agues,</HI> I made u&s;e of as many <HI>Pounds</HI> of the <HI>Bark</HI> in ei|ther of tho&s;e two Years, as I have &s;ince done <HI>Ounces</HI> in any &s;ub&s;equent Campaign, or Summer; the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>Fevers</HI> being &s;ince quite <HI>altered,</HI> and therefore requi|ring a different Method of Cure.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="38">
<P>And as for the common practice of the <HI>Netherland Phy&s;icians,</HI> in not u&s;ing the <HI>Bark</HI> for the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Agues,</HI> I am apt to believe, that it may have proceeded from a fear of <HI>Innovation</HI> in <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> by a New Medicine of that importance. As it happened before to the Learned <HI>Faculty</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> Who were as much afraid of <HI>Inovations,</HI> and all cried out, <HI>Fire,,</HI> when <HI>Spagyrical Preparations</HI> came fir&s;t into u&s;e. For prudent Per&s;ons will not lightly relinqui&s;h an E&s;tabli&s;hed Method. And I can &s;ay farther in their behalf, that &s;ome <HI>few</HI> among them do begin to be con|vinced, that the <HI>Bark</HI> does not de&s;erve to be too much neglected in the Cure of <HI>Agues.</HI> I may add concerning it, what is &s;aid of the <HI>Italians, When they are Good, they are extraordinary Good; and when Bad, as extraordinary Bad:</HI> So it may be &s;aid of the <HI>Bark,</HI> in what ca&s;es &s;oe|ver it is properly admini&s;tred, no medicine was ever known to have &s;uch great and good effects; but when it is improperly, or un&s;ea&s;onably given, it becomes one of the mo&s;t <HI>Dangerous</HI> that can be u&s;ed. And therefore tho&s;e who &s;hall think fit to u&s;e this <HI>Bark</HI> in hazadous or difficult Ca&s;es, or in A&s;thmatick Per&s;ons, mu&s;t be &s;ure to have a very watchful eye over it, to ob&s;erve whither it agrees, or di&s;agrees, and accordingly to pro&s;ecute, or quickly de&s;i&s;t from its u&s;e.</P>
<P>But it may be <HI>Objected,</HI> That <HI>Agues</HI> are in &s;ome Coun|tries more Dangerous in their nature, and Difficult of Cure, than they are in others; as they are &s;aid to be with us, in the <HI>Hundreds</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and in the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Shep|pey.</HI> And therefore that the <HI>Dutch</HI> may have good rea&s;on for neglecting, or deferring, as they do, to <HI>Cure</HI> their <HI>Agues</HI> by the u&s;e of the <HI>Cortex,</HI> or Bark; and which po&s;&s;ibly they do think will not agree &s;o well with <HI>their Agues,</HI> or <HI>their Tempers,</HI> as it is found to do with <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>To which I <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> That when I was abroad, I ne|ver ob&s;erved one &s;ingle Per&s;on, either at <HI>Loo,</HI> or in the
<PB N="66" REF="39"><HI>Field,</HI> who mi&s;s'd a Cure of his <HI>Ague</HI> by the u&s;e of the <HI>Bark,</HI> or who had any <HI>Relap&s;e</HI> afterwards, that throughly followed my Directions, both before, and after he had lo&s;t his Fits. And in that Succe&s;s, I do think my &s;elf very much obliged to the Worthy Mr. <HI>Rottermond,</HI> Apo|thecary to His <HI>Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on,</HI> for his &s;o good <HI>choice</HI> of the <HI>Bark</HI> I u&s;ed, and who is perfectly skilful in the knowledge of Simples, and in all the parts of <HI>Pharmacy.</HI> Indeed &s;ome of His <HI>Maje&s;ty's</HI> inferior Servants had <HI>Re|lap&s;es</HI> through their own neglect and folly, becau&s;e they would needs think them&s;elves well before I did, and &s;o &s;oon as they had mi&s;s'd the <HI>Fitt</HI> Returned; and this would &s;ometimes happen more than once unto the &s;ame Per&s;on.</P>
<P>And however the <HI>Bark</HI> has been &s;ometimes cen&s;ured, as if the <HI>Cures</HI> by it were more &s;ubject to <HI>Relap&s;es</HI> than by other Methods; on the contrary, I am fully per&s;uaded, that the <HI>Cures</HI> of <HI>Agues</HI> by <HI>Vomits, Sea&s;onable Purges,</HI> by <HI>Cordials acidulated,</HI> or by <HI>Amulets,</HI> or <HI>Dome&s;tick Applications</HI> alone, are all more &s;ubject to <HI>Relap&s;es,</HI> than tho&s;e by the <HI>Bark,</HI> if this be prudently admini&s;tred. To confirm which Opinion, I may add, That tho&s;e who recover by the <HI>Bark,</HI> look florid and vigorous, grow quickly athletick and &s;trong, and eat and dige&s;t well; whereas tho&s;e who mi&s;s their <HI>Fitts</HI> by other means, look pale and weakly &s;ome time after, and their natural functions do return more &s;lowly, and by degrees, to their former &s;trength and vigor.</P>
<P>As for <HI>our Agues,</HI> in the <HI>Hundreds</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Cure by the <HI>Bark</HI> does certainly agree with them, as well as with tho&s;e in other places. And it was to this very place, that our once famous Sir <HI>Robert Talbor</HI> had his recour&s;e, in order to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hing his Method of giving &s;uch repeated Do&s;es of the <HI>Bark.</HI></P>
<PB N="67" REF="39">
<P>I do apprehend an <HI>Ague</HI> to be but a weak and &s;light Attack of a <HI>Fever,</HI> or to be an <HI>imperfect Fever,</HI> or it may be &s;aid to be a <HI>Fever by halfs.</HI> Either the Enemy that makes the A&s;&s;ault is weak and feeble, or the Fort that Na|ture defends, is Strong, and well prepared to make Re|&s;i&s;tance. Either the Body is not &s;ufficiently predi&s;po&s;ed for &s;uch a Combu&s;tion as the <HI>Continued Fever</HI> does occa&s;ion, or the <HI>Pores</HI> are then but <HI>little Ob&s;tructed;</HI> and therefore after the two fir&s;t proper Symptoms of a <HI>Fever,</HI> the <HI>Cold|ne&s;s</HI> or Shivering, and the <HI>Burning Heat,</HI> have a-while ex|erted them&s;elves, there is alwasy in an <HI>Ague</HI> a &s;udden &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of a Profu&s;e <HI>Sweat,</HI> which terminates the <HI>Fit.</HI> For when the <HI>Burning</HI> &s;till remains, and no <HI>Sweat</HI> &s;ucceeds, the <HI>Fever Continues</HI> of cour&s;e, and undergoes another de|nomination.</P>
<P>The one may be &s;aid to make its Impre&s;&s;ion more <HI>Out|wardly,</HI> and upon the <HI>Pores;</HI> the other not only &s;o, but al&s;o more <HI>Inwardly,</HI> and upon the <HI>Vitals.</HI> The one falls chiefly upon the <HI>Outworks,</HI> or upon the <HI>Counter&s;carp,</HI> the other makes a breach in a <HI>Ba&s;tions,</HI> or in the <HI>Courtine.</HI> The Attack of the one is not in it &s;elf <HI>hazardous,</HI> or dangerous to the &s;tate of the Body; the Attack of the other is like a <HI>General A&s;&s;ault,</HI> and proves of a <HI>Critical</HI> nature, or de|termines the fate of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> And this is a more ea&s;y, and natural, and a more intelligible explication of the General Difference between <HI>Fevers</HI> and <HI>Agues,</HI> than other Accounts of them, that are more Ob&s;cure and In|tricate, more Philo&s;ophical, or artificially wrought into &s;ome Ingenious <HI>Hypothe&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>I have Ob&s;erved, that in <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> or Times when <HI>Agues</HI> are very <HI>Epidemical,</HI> as it is in <HI>Countries</HI> where they are very common and frequent, the <HI>Continued Fevers</HI> are u&s;u|ally of the &s;ame nature and progeny, and do generally require a like Method of Cure, and are actually Cured by a prudent u&s;e of the <HI>Conrtex,</HI> as <HI>Intermittent Fevers,</HI> or
<PB N="68" REF="40"><HI>Agues</HI> are. Only in the former we mu&s;t always remem|ber, as we mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ometimes in the latter, to take care that we u&s;e &s;ufficient proper <HI>Evacuations,</HI> in order to bring the &s;mall <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion</HI> that they then commonly have, to &s;ome <HI>Intermi&s;&s;ion,</HI> if it can be obtained, before we pre|&s;ume to give the <HI>Bark.</HI> And then we may as &s;afely and effecttually make u&s;e of the <HI>Bark</HI> in the fir&s;t, as we do without difficulty in the other. I hope the Reader will excu&s;e this Digre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e, with re&s;pect to my Fa|culty, it may be matter of note and illu&s;tration to &s;ome, if not of u&s;e and benefit al&s;o to the Publick.</P>
<P>The Diet and Air of the <HI>Dutch</HI> do much contribute to their growing &s;o plump, and fat; and that may be one rea&s;on, why they <HI>Bleed</HI> &s;o &s;paringly, and &s;eldom as they do. For when they do think fit to <HI>Bleed,</HI> they will &s;eldom or never take away more <HI>Blood</HI> from a Man or Wo|man, than we do from an <HI>Infant</HI> of a Year old. How they came to fall into &s;uch an Extremity of <HI>Bleeding little,</HI> I cannot well comprehend, con&s;idering how pro|fu&s;ely the <HI>French,</HI> and the more Southern Nations, do u&s;e <HI>Vene&s;ection</HI> upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions. Nor are the <HI>Dutch</HI> the mo&s;t ab&s;temious from <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandy,</HI> which will be apt to heat and inflame the Blood, and con&s;equently upon exce&s;s &s;ometimes cau&s;e <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> that properly re|quire <HI>large Bleedings;</HI> neither am I ignorant that their <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> are very <HI>Learned Men,</HI> and mu&s;t read tho&s;e Excellent Books of <HI>Galen,</HI> concerning <HI>Vene&s;ection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coughs,</HI> that are &s;o common with us, are very &s;eldom known among the <HI>Dutch;</HI> in&s;omuch that in the <HI>Autumn,</HI> when we are <HI>deafning</HI> one another with <HI>Continual Cough|ing,</HI> you may go into a <HI>Church</HI> there, and not hear a &s;ingle per&s;on <HI>Cough.</HI> And for this rea&s;on I am induced to think, when an <HI>Inflammation</HI> there falls upon the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and cau&s;es a <HI>violent Cough,</HI> they cannot &s;o well deal with &s;uch a &s;trange and <HI>foreign Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> as
<PB N="69" REF="40">tho&s;e who have le&s;s apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Bleeding plentifully</HI> when there is occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have been ask'd &s;ometimes the rea&s;on, why <HI>Holland</HI> has &s;o few, or <HI>No Coughs,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> &s;o many. The True Rea&s;on I conceive to be this: <HI>Holland</HI> has as great a &s;carcity of <HI>Minerals,</HI> as of <HI>Corn,</HI> of its native growth. <HI>England</HI> does abound with <HI>Minerals</HI> of divers Kinds, that are very offen&s;ive to the <HI>Lungs;</HI> how&s;oever <HI>Chymi&s;ts</HI> may commend the <HI>Preparations</HI> from them, for <HI>other</HI> Phy&s;ical u&s;es. And our <HI>Air</HI> does abound with <HI>Mineral Effluviums,</HI> and much of our <HI>water</HI> with <HI>Mineral Impregnations.</HI> This is al&s;o the rea&s;on, why the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Sheppey,</HI> otherwi&s;e a Rich Country, is &s;o unwhol&s;ome to live in. And this is the rea&s;on, why the Waters of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and others Rivers in <HI>Hungary</HI> are &s;o unhealthful to drink of. For it was well &s;aid of <HI>Plmy,</HI> the Great Naturali&s;t: <HI>Tales &s;unt Aquae, quales Terroe per quas &s;luunt.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot omit to take &s;ome notice of the <HI>good Provi&s;ion</HI> they do make for their <HI>Poor,</HI> whereby they are not pe&s;ter'd or mole&s;ted in their Streets, in their Shops, in their Coaches, with any crowd of Beggars, which would &s;erve to divert their <HI>Chavity</HI> from proper and good Objects; I mean poor Labourers, or Hou&s;ekeepers, who take much pains, to the getting little, towards a &s;orry main|tenance of a great many Children; or &s;uch who through Infir|mities, or Accidents, are di&s;abled from getting any thing at all, and are above the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>Begging.</HI> If the <HI>Poor</HI> there cannot work, or do want work, there is provi&s;ion made for them both. The <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> or <HI>Officers,</HI> do not think it any <HI>trouble</HI> to them, to go &s;ometimes from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, to enquire privately into their Condition, to ob&s;erve what Children they have, and to un|der&s;tand what they can, or cannot do, towards their Maintenance. And accordingly, both the <HI>known,</HI> and <HI>unknown Poor,</HI> who are a&s;ha|med to ask for what they want, are &s;upplied by the <HI>Publick</HI> from time to time.</P>
<P>In their <HI>Churches</HI> they do never a&s;&s;emble to &s;erve <HI>God,</HI> but they manife&s;t their <HI>Love</HI> to their <HI>Neighbour.</HI> There is always a <HI>Bag</HI> tran&s;|mitted to every per&s;on, with the notice of a little <HI>Bell;</HI> and I am told, that there's hardly one &s;ingle Per&s;on, though never &s;o mean or little, that comes to <HI>Church,</HI> but does drop &s;ome <HI>Mite,</HI> or <HI>Doit,</HI> into the <HI>Poor's Bag,</HI> every time he comes. And what&s;oever is &s;o Collected, or upon other Occa&s;ions, for the <HI>Poor,</HI> does not &s;erve
<PB N="70" REF="41">to fatten, and make merry, the Petty Officers, but is faichfully ac|counted for, and expended duly to its proper u&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apparel</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> is grave, and free from levith. The men do put on <HI>Black</HI> on Sundays, and other high days; and at other times dark Colours. And this is the mode of all Citizens, and many others, even fo the Boors, not only in the <HI>Seven Pro|vinces,</HI> but in <HI>Brabant,</HI> and <HI>Flanders.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, their <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> both Men and Women, do dre&s;s as fine, and modi&s;hly, as we our &s;elves, or others, that cannot for all the world help imi|tating of <HI>Apeing</HI> the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed I mu&s;t &s;ay, we in <HI>England</HI> are not in &s;uch mighty ha&s;t for <HI>New Fa&s;hions,</HI> but that we can make a &s;hift to &s;tay until our <HI>Taylors</HI> do &s;upply us, and make us happy with <HI>Modes</HI> from <HI>Frances,</HI> by their taking a Journey on purpo&s;e to <HI>Paris</HI> in vacation-time. But &s;ome of the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> are more careful to be <HI>&agrave; la mode de France</HI> as early as may be; for they have the <HI>Fa&s;hions</HI> brought to them &s;ome hundred Leagues in Po&s;t-ha&s;te; and, before the War, did u&s;e to keep <HI>Couriers</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI> ready, to bring them quickly mat|ters of &s;uch great moment, upon the <HI>fir&s;t Invention</HI> of a <HI>New Mode.</HI> As if <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> or a &s;udden irruption on a Neighbour-State, could not be of greater concern, than a new-cut Feather in the Cap, or &s;ome &s;urprizing Ma&s;terpiece of Gayety.</P>
<P>And thus I have but gently toucht upon &s;ome of the Cu&s;toms, and &s;ome part of the Good Government of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which though in &s;o near a Neighbour-State, they cannot but be well known to many of our <HI>better &s;ort,</HI> who are perfectly well acquainted with this part of the Word, and much better than they can be inform|ed by me; yet I thought even the mentioning the&s;e things would not be unacceptable to &s;ome others, who have never been abroad. For it I &s;hould undertake the Relation at large of only the <HI>Curio&s;i|ties</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> it &s;elf, or &s;hould particularly &s;peak of the <HI>Key&s;er-Grafs,</HI> the <HI>Princes-Graft,</HI> and the <HI>Heer-Graft,</HI> three &s;pacious Streets that do alm&s;t incircle the whole <HI>City,</HI> and three Streets that con|tain more Sumptuous Hou&s;es, all of Stone, throughout their long circuit, than can be well imagined by tho&s;e who have not &s;een them; or if I &s;hould treat of the Plea&s;ant and Magni&s;icent Gar|dens of <HI>Sorgvliet,</HI> within a Mile of the <HI>Hague,</HI> given &s;ome years &s;ince by His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> to the Right Honourable the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Portland,</HI> and which no Strangers, that have any Curio&s;ity, can omit See|ing; they are &s;o Admirable and Plea&s;ant: and the <HI>King</HI> does often
<PB N="71" REF="41">retire thithes to Dine, whil&s;t he re&s;ides at the <HI>Hague;</HI> or la&s;tly, if I &s;hould de&s;cribe the Charming Sweetne&s;s of the <HI>Hague,</HI> in the Sum|mer-time, the Plea&s;antne&s;s of <HI>Leyden,</HI> or enter into a repetition of what others have done with applau&s;e before, this Account would &s;oon &s;well into a <HI>Volume,</HI> and a &s;hort <HI>Memorandum</HI> into a <HI>prolix Nar|ration.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, The <HI>Dutch</HI> do de&s;erve great Con&s;ideration and Kindne&s;s from us, as they are become a Principal <HI>Bulwork</HI> of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> next unto <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Church</HI> is without di&s;|pute the chiefe&s;t <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and the brighte&s;t <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>True Moderation,</HI> between the gay Decorations and Paintings of <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> on the one &s;ide, and the mean and homely Adrre&s;&s;es to <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty</HI> on the other. And now e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Dutch</HI> may lay nearer claim to our Amity, when the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> in general had never greater need of <HI>Bulworks</HI> and <HI>Defences;</HI> when not only <HI>France</HI> does manife&s;t an unparallel'd <HI>Bigo|try</HI> by an impolitick and unchri&s;tian Rage and <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> that may in time be found &s;o to weaken and unpeople it &s;el&s;, as to be a <HI>main cau&s;e</HI> of her Declen&s;ion, what&s;oever glorious or formida|ble appearance &s;he may make for the pre&s;ent; but al&s;o divers <HI>Ro|man Catholick Princes</HI> have with one accord, and with an unu&s;ual Sympathy, in this Age exerted a <HI>Zeal</HI> again&s;t their <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Sub|jects, that is incon&s;i&s;tent with their own <HI>Temporal Intere&s;t,</HI> and contrary to the Rules of <HI>Humanity</HI> or <HI>Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis certain, that whenever <HI>Religion</HI> comes to be &s;o far abu&s;ed, as to lay a&s;ide the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential part of it, <HI>Churity,</HI> it blinds the Eyes of all <HI>Zealots,</HI> that they cannot &s;ee their own <HI>In|tore&s;t;</HI> it tran&s;ports and turns them from all the Rules of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> and makes men commit the mo&s;t fatal, and extrava|gant <HI>Errrors,</HI> in Politicks and Civil Socity.</P>
<P>It is worth the Con&s;ideration of warm and imprudent Princes, who&s;e indi&s;creet Zeal it &s;o apt to in&s;tigate them to mole&s;t and ha|ra&s;s their Subjects for the &s;ake of what Hone&s;t and Pious men cannot &s;ometimes help, I mean, difference in <HI>Religious</HI> Senti|ments, what happened to the Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Fifth,</HI> after he had Re&s;igned the <HI>Empire</HI> to his Brother <HI>Ferdimand,</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> to his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> This Warlike and Great Prince, after he was grown weary of the Pomp and Glories of the World, and had made his <HI>Retreat</HI> into a <HI>Mona&s;tery,</HI> had abundance of <HI>Clocks</HI> broght him thither by the be&s;t Arti&s;ts
<PB N="72" REF="42">he could hear of; and his de&s;ire was to make all his <HI>Clocks</HI> &s;trike together at the &s;ame Hour.

<P>And therefore, &s;ince now no former Alliances, no common Intere&s;t, no remenbrance of Benefits lately received, no Obliga|tions, how great &s;oever, can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;train <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Po|tentates from trampling their own Subjects under their feet, meerly for thinking otherwi&s;e than they do in matters of <HI>Supper&s;ti|tion,</HI> and from attemptng to <HI>Convert</HI> them by the powerful mi&s;&s;ion of irre&s;i&s;tible <HI>Dragoons,</HI> and by more refined Methods than were heretofore practi&s;ed in the Ten dull Pagan Per&s;ecutions; mo&s;t certainly at <HI>Hearty Union,</HI> and Strict Alliance, and <HI>Freind&s;hip,</HI> be|tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> was never more ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary than at this time, for the Good and Pro&s;perity, &s;hall I &s;ay, or for the <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> and mutual Defence of <HI>both Nations,</HI> and al&s;o for the maintenance and &s;upport of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> through|out <HI>Europe.</HI> Whil&s;t <HI>We</HI> &s;tand firm, and &s;trictly <HI>United</HI> with <HI>Hol|land,</HI> we &s;hall have no need to fear the Power or Attempts of <HI>any Common Enemy;</HI> our <HI>Trane</HI> can never &s;uffter in any great degree, and our <HI>Riches</HI> will &s;upply to us &s;uch <HI>Smews</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> &s;uch an inex|hau&s;tible <HI>Magazine</HI> of <HI>Military Force,</HI> as will defeat and overcome tho&s;e <HI>Princes</HI> or <HI>Monarchs,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Ambition</HI> will never &s;uffer them to be <HI>quiet,</HI> but whil&s;t they are <HI>di&s;turbing</HI> the <HI>Peace</HI> of their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> or who will needs be aiming at <HI>Impo&s;&s;ibilities,</HI> the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone,</HI> or <HI>Univer&s;al Monarchy.</HI></P>
