<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PROVINCE of Penn&s;ilvania IN AMERICA; Lately Granted under the Great Seal of ENGLAND TO William Penn, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SInce (by the good providence of God) a Country in <HI>America</HI> is fallen to my lot, I thought it not le&s;s my Duty than my hone&s;t In|tere&s;t to give &s;ome publick notice of it to the World, that tho&s;e of our own, or other Nations, that are inclin'd to Tran&s;port them&s;elves or Families beyond the Seas, may find another Country added to their choice, that if they &s;hall happen to like the <HI>Place, Conditions</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;titutions,</HI> (&s;o far as the pre&s;ent Infancy of things will allow us any pro&s;pect) they may, if they plea&s;e, fix with me in the <HI>Province</HI> here|after de&s;crib'd. But before I come to treat of my particular Concern|ment, I &s;hall take leave to &s;ay &s;omething of the benefit of <HI>Plantations</HI> or <HI>Colonies</HI> in general, to obviate a common Objection.</P>
<P><HI>Colonies</HI> then are the Seeds of Nations begun and nouri&s;hed by the care of wi&s;e and populous Countries; as conceiving them be&s;t for the in|crea&s;e of Humane Stock, and beneficial for Commerce.</P>
<P>Some of the wi&s;e&s;t men in Hi&s;tory have ju&s;tly taken their Fame from this De&s;ign and Service: We read of the Reputation given on this ac|count to <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Caleb</HI> in Scripture-Records; and what Re|nown the <HI>Greek</HI>-&s;tory yields to <HI>Lycurgus, The&s;eus,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Greeks</HI> that
<PB N="2" REF="3"> Planted many parts of <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> Nor is the <HI>Roman</HI> account wanting of in|&s;tances to the Credit of that People; They had a <HI>Romulus,</HI> a <HI>Numa Pompilius;</HI> and not only reduc'd, but moraliz'd the Manners of the Nations they &s;ubjected; &s;o that they may have been rather &s;aid to con|quer their Barbarity than Them.</P>
<P>Nor did any of the&s;e ever dream it was the way of decrea&s;ing their People or Wealth: For the cau&s;e of the decay of any of tho&s;e States or Empires was not their <HI>Plantations,</HI> but their <HI>Luxury and corruption of Man|ners:</HI> For when they grew to neglect their ancient Di&s;cipline, that main|tained and rewarded Virtue and Indu&s;try, and addicted them&s;elves to <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Effeminacy,</HI> they debas'd their Spirits and debauch'd their Morals, from whence Ruine did never fail to follow to any People: With Ju&s;tice therefore I deny the vulgar Opinion again&s;t <HI>Plantations, That they weaken</HI> England; they have manife&s;tly inrich'd, and &s;o &s;trengthned her; Which I briefly evidence thus.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Tho&s;e that go into a Foreign <HI>Plantation,</HI> their Indu&s;try there is worth more than if they &s;tay'd at home, the Product of their Labour being in Commodities of a &s;uperiour Nature to tho&s;e of this <HI>Country.</HI> For In&s;tance, What is an improved Acre in <HI>Jamaica</HI> or <HI>Barbadoes</HI> worth to an improved Acre in <HI>England?</HI> We know 'tis threetimes the value, and the product of it comes for <HI>England,</HI> and is u&s;ually paid for in <HI>Engli&s;h Growth</HI> and <HI>Manufacture.</HI> Nay, <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;hews that an ordinary Indu&s;try in one man produces Three thou&s;and pound weight of Tobacco and Twenty Barrels of Corn yearly: He feeds him&s;elf, and brings as much of Commodity into <HI>England</HI> be&s;ides as being return'd in the Growth and Workman&s;hip of this Countrey, is much more than he could have &s;pent here: Let it al&s;o be remembred, that the Three thou&s;and weight of Tobacco brings in Three thou&s;and Two-pences by way of Cu&s;tom to the King, which makes Twenty five Pounds; An extraordinary Profit.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. More being produc'd and imported than we can &s;pend here, we Export it to other Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> which brings in Money, or the Growth of tho&s;e Countries, which is the &s;ame thing; And this is the Advantage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Merchants and Seamen.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Such as could not only not <HI>marry</HI> here, but hardly live and allow them&s;elves Cloaths, do marry there, and be&s;tow thrice more in all Nece&s;&s;aries and Conveniencies (and not a little in Ornamental things too) for them&s;elves, their Wives and Children, both as to Ap|parel and Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff; which coming out of <HI>England, I &s;ay 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible that</HI> England <HI>&s;hould not be a con&s;iderable Gainer.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. But let it be con&s;ider'd, <HI>That the Plantations imploy many hundreds of Shipping, and many thou&s;ands of Seamen;</HI> which mu&s;t be in divers re&s;pects an Advantage to <HI>England,</HI> being an I&s;land, and by Na|ture fitted for Navigation above any Countrey in <HI>Europe.</HI> This is fol|lowed by other depending Trades, as <HI>Shipwrights, Carpenters, Sawyers, Hewers, Trunnel-makers, Joyners, Slop&s;ellers, Dry-&s;alters, Iron-workers,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;tland-Merchants, Timber-&s;ellers,</HI> and <HI>Victuallers,</HI> with many more Trades which hang upon <HI>Navigation:</HI> So that we may ea&s;ily &s;ee the Ob|jection (<HI>That Colonies or Plantations hurt</HI> England) is at lea&s;t of no
<PB N="3" REF="3"> &s;trength, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider how many thou&s;and <HI>Blacks</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> are al&s;o accomodated with <HI>Cloaths</HI> and many &s;orts of <HI>Tools</HI> and <HI>&V;ten&s;ils</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> and that their <HI>Labour</HI> is mo&s;tly brought hither, which adds <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>People</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h Dominions.</HI> But 'tis further &s;aid, <HI>They injure</HI> England, <HI>in that they draw away too many of the people; for we are not &s;o populous in the Countries as formerly:</HI> I &s;ay there are other rea&s;ons for that.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>Country-People</HI> are &s;o extremely addicted to put their Children into Gentlemens Service, or &s;end them to Towns to learn Trades, that <HI>Husbandry is neglected;</HI> and after a &s;oft and delicate U&s;age there, they are for ever unfitted for the Labour of a <HI>Farming</HI> Life.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The <HI>Pride</HI> of the Age in its <HI>Attendance</HI> and <HI>Retinue</HI> is &s;o gro&s;s and univer&s;al, that where a man of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year formerly kept but four or five Servants, he now keeps more than twice the number; He mu&s;t have a <HI>Gentleman</HI> to wait upon him in his Chambers, a <HI>Coach-man,</HI> a <HI>Groom</HI> or two, a <HI>Butler,</HI> a <HI>Man-Cook,</HI> a <HI>Gardner,</HI> two or three <HI>Lac|ques,</HI> it may be an <HI>Hunt&s;man,</HI> and a <HI>Faulkner,</HI> the Wife a <HI>Gentlewoman,</HI> and <HI>Maids accordingly:</HI> This was not known by our <HI>Ancestors</HI> of like Quality. This hinders the <HI>Plough</HI> and the <HI>Dairy,</HI> from whence they are taken, and in&s;tead of keeping People to Manly-labour, they are effe|minated by a lazy and luxurious Living; But which is wor&s;e, the&s;e people <HI>rarely marry,</HI> tho' many of them do wor&s;e; but if they do, 'tis when they are in Age; And the rea&s;on is clear, becau&s;e their u&s;ual <HI>Kee|ping</HI> at their Ma&s;ters is too great and co&s;tly for them with a Family at their own Charge, and they &s;carcely know how to live lower; &s;o that too many of them chu&s;e rather to vend their Lu&s;ts at an <HI>evil Ordinary</HI> than hone&s;tly Marry and Work: <HI>The exce&s;s and &s;loth of the Age not allowing of Marriage and the Charge that follows;</HI> all which hinders the increa&s;e of our People. If Men, they often turn either <HI>Souldiers,</HI> or <HI>Gamesters,</HI> or <HI>Highway-men.</HI> If Women, they too frequently <HI>dre&s;s them&s;elves for a bad market,</HI> rather than know the <HI>Dairy</HI> again, or ho|ne&s;tly return to <HI>Labour,</HI> whereby it happens that both the Stock of the Nation decays and the I&s;&s;ue is corrupted.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Of old time the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> &s;pent their E&s;tates in the Country, and that kept the people in it; and their Servants married and &s;ate at ea&s;ie Rents under their Ma&s;ters favour, which peopled the place: Now the Great men (too much loving the Town and re&s;orting to <HI>London</HI>) draw many people thither to attend them, who either don't marry; or if they do, they pine away their &s;mall gains in &s;ome petty Shop; for there are &s;o many, they prey upon one another.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Country being thus neglected, <HI>and no due Ballance kept between Trade and Husbandry, City and Country,</HI> the poor Country-man takes double Toil, and cannot (for want of hands) dre&s;s and manure his Land to the Advantage it formerly yielded him, yet mu&s;t he pay the old Rents, which occa&s;ions Servants, and &s;uch Children as go not to Trades, to continue &s;ingle, at lea&s;t <HI>all their youthful time,</HI> which al&s;o ob|&s;tructs the increa&s;e of our people.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The decay of &s;ome Country-manufactures (where no Provi&s;ion is made to &s;upply the people with a new way of living) cau&s;es the more Indu&s;trious to go abroad to &s;eek their Bread in other Countries, and
<PB N="4" REF="4"> gives the lazy an occa&s;ion to loiter and beg or do wor&s;e, by which means the Land <HI>&s;warms with Beggars:</HI> Formerly 'twas rare to find any asking <HI>Alms</HI> but the <HI>Maimed,</HI> or <HI>Blind,</HI> or <HI>very Aged;</HI> now thou&s;ands of both Sexes run up and down, both City and Country, that are &s;ound and youthful, and able to work, with fal&s;e Pretences and Certificates; nor is there any care taken to imploy or deter &s;uch Vagrants, which weakens the Country, as to People and Labour.</P>
<P>To which let me add, that the great <HI>Debauchery</HI> in this Kingdom has not only rendred many unfruitful when married, but they live not out half their time, through Exce&s;&s;es, which might be prevented by a vigo|rous execution of our good Laws again&s;t corruption of manners. The&s;e and the like evils are the true grounds of the decay of our People in the Country, to &s;ay nothing of <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>Wars:</HI> Towns and Cities can|not complain of the decay of People, being more repleni&s;h'd than ever, e&s;pecially <HI>London,</HI> which with rea&s;on helps the Country-man to this Objection. And though &s;ome do go to the <HI>Plantations,</HI> yet numbering the Pari&s;hes in <HI>England,</HI> and computing how many live more than die, and are born than buried, there goes not over to all the <HI>Plantations</HI> a fourth part of the yearly increa&s;e of the People. and when they are there, <HI>they are not</HI> (as I &s;aid before) <HI>lo&s;t to</HI> England, &s;ince they furni&s;h them with much <HI>Cloaths, Hou&s;hold-stuff, Tools,</HI> and the like nece&s;&s;aries, and that in greater quantities than here their condition could have nee|ded, or they could have bought, being there well to pa&s;s, that were but low here, if not poor; and now Ma&s;ters of Families too, when here they had none, and could hardly keep them&s;elves; and very often it happens that &s;ome of them, after their Indu&s;try and Succe&s;s there have made them wealthy, they return and <HI>empty</HI> their Riches into <HI>England;</HI> one in this capacity being able to buy out twenty of what he was when he went over.</P>
<P>Thus much to ju&s;tifie the Credit and Benefit of <HI>Plantations;</HI> wherein I have not &s;ought to &s;peak my Intere&s;t, but my Judgment; and I dare venture the &s;ucce&s;s of it with all &s;ober and con&s;idering men. I &s;hall now proceed to give &s;ome account of my own concern.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>I &s;hall &s;ay what may be nece&s;&s;ary of the Place or Province.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Touch upon the Con&s;titutions.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Lay down the Conditions.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Give my &s;en&s;e what per&s;ons will be fit to go.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>What &V;ten&s;ils, Furniture and Commodities are fit to carry with them, with the charge of the voyage, and what is first to be done and expected there for &s;ome time.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, <HI>I &s;hall give an Ab&s;tract of the Grant by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>that an account may be given of the E&s;tate and Power granted to me thereby.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Something of the Place.</HEAD>
<P>The Place lies 600 miles nearer the Sun than <HI>England;</HI> for <HI>England</HI> begins at the 50th. Degree and ten minutes of North Latitude, and this Place begins at fourty, which is about the Latitude of <HI>Naples</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> or <HI>Mompellier</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay little in its prai&s;e, to excite de&s;ires in any, whatever I could truly write as to the Soil, Air and Water: This &s;hall &s;atisfie me, that by the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of God, and the hone&s;ty and indu&s;try of Man, it may be a good and fruitful Land.</P>
<P>For <HI>Navigation</HI> it is &s;aid to have two conveniencies; the one by lying
<PB N="5" REF="4"> Nine&s;core miles upon <HI>Delaware</HI> River; that is to &s;ay, about three|&s;core and ten miles, before we come to the <HI>Falls,</HI> where a Ve&s;&s;el of Two hundred Tuns may Sail, (and &s;ome Creeks and &s;mall Harbours in that di&s;tance, where Ships may come nearer than the River into the Country) and above the <HI>Falls,</HI> for Sloops and Boots, as I am informed, to the extent of the Patent. The other convenience is through <HI>Che&s;pa|peak-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>For Timber and other Wood there is variety for the u&s;e of man.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fowl, Fi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Wild-Deer,</HI> they are reported to be plentiful in tho&s;e Parts. Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Provi&s;ion is likewi&s;e now to be had there at rea|&s;onable Rates. The Commodities that the Country is thought to be <HI>capable</HI> of, are <HI>Silk, Flax, Hemp, Wine, Sider, Woad, Madder, Liquori&s;h, Tobacco, Pot-a&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> and it does actually produce <HI>Hides, Tallow, Pipe &s;taves, Beef, Pork, Sheep, Wool, Corn,</HI> as <HI>Wheat, Barly, Ry,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Furs,</HI> as your <HI>Peltree, Mincks, Racoons, Martins,</HI> and &s;uch like; &s;tore of <HI>Furs</HI> which is to be found among the <HI>Indians,</HI> that are profita|ble Commodities in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The way of trading in tho&s;e Countries is thus: they &s;end to the Southern Plantations <HI>Corn, Beef, Pork, Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pipe-&s;taves,</HI> and take their Growth and bring for <HI>England,</HI> and return with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to their own Country. Their <HI>Furs</HI> they bring for <HI>England,</HI> and either &s;ell them here, or carry them out again to other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where they will yield a better price: And for tho&s;e that will follow <HI>Merchandize</HI> and <HI>Navigation</HI> there is conveniency, and <HI>Timber &s;ufficient for Shipping.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II. The Con&s;titutions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>For the Constitution of the Country, the Patent &s;hows, first,</HI> That the People and Governour have a Legi&s;lative Power, &s;o that no Law can be made, nor Money rai&s;ed, but by the Peoples con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That the Rights and Freedoms of <HI>England (the be&s;t and large&s;t in</HI> Europe) &s;hall be in force there.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That making no Law again&s;t Allegiance (<HI>which &s;hould we, 'twere by the Law of</HI> England <HI>void of it &s;elf that moment</HI>) we may Enact what Laws we plea&s;e for the good pro&s;perity and &s;ecurity of the &s;aid Province.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>That &s;o &s;oon as any are ingaged with me, we &s;hall begin a</HI> Scheam <HI>or</HI> Draught <HI>together, &s;uch as &s;hall give ample Te&s;timony of my &s;incere Incli|nations to encourage Planters, and &s;ettle a free, ju&s;t and industrious</HI> Colo|ny <HI>there.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III. The Conditions.</HEAD>
<P>My Conditions will relate to three &s;orts of people: <HI>1&s;t.</HI> Tho&s;e that will <HI>buy: 2dly.</HI> Tho&s;e that take up Land upon <HI>Rent: 3dly.</HI> Servants. To the first, the Shares I &s;ell &s;hall be certain as to number of Acres; that is to &s;ay, every one &s;hall contain Five thou&s;and Acres, free from any <HI>Indian</HI> in|cumbrance, the price a hundred pounds, and for the Quit-rent but one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hilling or the value of it yearly for a hundred Acres; and the &s;aid Quit-Rent not to begin to be paid till <HI>1684.</HI> To the &s;econd &s;ort, that take up Land upon Rent, they &s;hall have liberty &s;o to do paying yearly <HI>one peny</HI> per Acre, not exceeding Two hundred Acres. To the third &s;ort, to wit, <HI>Ser|vants</HI> that are carried over, Fifty Acres &s;hall be allowed to the Ma&s;ter for every Head, and Fifty Acres to every Servant when their time is expired.
<PB N="6" REF="5"> And becau&s;e &s;ome engage with me that may not be di&s;po&s;ed to go, it were very advi&s;able for every three Adventurers to &s;end an Over&s;eer with their Ser|vants, which would well pay the Cost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divident</HI> may be thus; if the per&s;ons concern'd plea&s;e, a Tract of Land &s;hall be &s;urvey'd; &s;ay <HI>Fifty thou&s;and Acres to a hundred Adven|turers;</HI> in which &s;ome of the be&s;t &s;hall be &s;et out for Towns or Cities; and there &s;hall be &s;o much Ground allotted to each in tho&s;e Towns as may main|tain &s;ome Cattel and produce &s;ome Corn; then the remainder of the fifty thou&s;and Acres &s;hall be &s;har'd among the &s;aid <HI>Adventurerers</HI> (ca|&s;ting up the Barren for Commons, and allowing for the &s;ame) whereby every <HI>Adventurer</HI> will have a con&s;iderable quantity of Land together; likewi&s;e every one a proportion by a Navigable River, and then backward into the Country. The manner of divident I &s;hall not be &s;trict in; we can but &s;peak roughly of the matter here; but let men skilful in <HI>Plantations</HI> be con&s;ulted, and I &s;hall leave it to the majority of votes among the <HI>Adventurers</HI> when it &s;hall plea&s;e God we come there, how to fix it to their own content.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV. The&s;e per&s;ons that providence &s;eems to have mo&s;t fitted for Plantations are,</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> Industrious <HI>Husbandmen</HI> and <HI>Day-Labourers,</HI> that are hardly able (with extreme Labour) to maintain their Families and portion their Children.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Laborious <HI>Handicrafts,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Carpenters, Ma&s;ons, Smiths, Weavers, Taylors, Tanners, Shoemakers, Shipwrights,</HI> &amp;c. where they may be &s;pared or are low in the World: And as they &s;hall want no en|couragement, &s;o their Labour is worth more there than here, and there pro|vi&s;ion cheaper.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> A Plantation &s;eems a fit place for tho&s;e <HI>Ingenious Spirits</HI> that being low in the World, are much clogg'd and oppre&s;s'd about a Livelyhood, for the means of &s;ub&s;isting being ea&s;ie there, they may have time and oppor|tunity to gratify their inclinations, and thereby improve Science and help Nur&s;eries of people.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly.</HI> A fourth &s;ort of men to whom a <HI>Plantation</HI> would be proper, takes in tho&s;e that are <HI>younger Brothers</HI> of &s;mall Inheritances; yet becau&s;e they would live in &s;ight of their Kindred in &s;ome proportion to their Quality, and can't do it without a labour that looks like <HI>Farming,</HI> their condition is too &s;trait for them; and if married, their Children are often too numerous for the E&s;tate, and are frequently bred up to no Trades, but are a kind of <HI>Hangers on or Retainers to the elder Brothers Table and Charity:</HI> which is a mi&s;chief, as in it &s;elf to be lamented, &s;o here to be remedied; For Land they have for next to nothing, which with moderate Labour produces plenty of all things nece&s;&s;ary for Life, and &s;uch an increa&s;e as by Traffique may &s;upply them with all conveniencies</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> There are another &s;ort of per&s;ons, not only fit for, but nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Plantations,</HI> and that is, <HI>Men of univer&s;al Spirits,</HI> that have an eye to the Good of Po&s;terity, and that both understand and delight to promote good Di&s;cipline and just Government among a plain and well intending people; &s;uch per&s;ons may find <HI>Room in Colonies for their good Coun&s;el and Con|trivance,</HI> who are &s;hut out from being of much u&s;e or &s;ervice to great Nati|ons
<PB N="7" REF="5"> under &s;ettl'd Customs: The&s;e men de&s;erve much e&s;teem, and would be hearken'd to. Doubtle&s;s 'twas this <HI>(as I ob&s;erv'd before)</HI> that put &s;ome of the famous <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> upon Tran&s;planting and Regulating <HI>Colo|nies</HI> of People in divers parts of the World; who&s;e Names, for giving &s;o great proof of their Wi&s;dom, Virtue, Labour and Con&s;tancy, are with Ju&s;tice honourably delivered down by &s;tory to the prai&s;e of our own times; though the World, after all its higher pretences of Religion, barbarou&s;ly errs from their excellent Example.</P>

And becau&s;e I know how much People are apt to fancy things beyond what they are, and that Imma|ginations are great flatterers of the minds of Men; To the end that none may delude them&s;elves, with an expectation of an Immediate Amendment of their conditions, &s;o &s;oon as it &s;hall plea&s;e God they Arrive there; I would have them under&s;tand, <HI>That they mu&s;t look for a Winter before a Sum|mer comes;</HI> and they mu&s;t be willing to be two or three years without &s;ome of the conveniences they enjoy at home; And yet I mu&s;t needs &s;ay that <HI>Ame|rica</HI> is another thing then it was at the fir&s;t Plantation of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England:</HI> For there is better Accommodation, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Provi&s;ions are to be had at ea&s;ier rates: However, I am inclin'd to &s;et down par|ticulars, as near as tho&s;e inform me, that know the Place, and have been Planters both in that and in the Neighbouring <HI>Colonys.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> The pa&s;&s;age will come for Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es at mo&s;t to <HI>6</HI> Pounds a Head, for Servants Five Pounds a Head, and for Children under Seven years of Age Fifty Shillings, except they Suck, then nothing.</P>
<P>Next being by the mercy of God, &s;afely Arrived in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> two Men may clear as much Ground by Spring (when they &s;et the Corn of that Country) as will bring in that time twelve month Forty Barrels, which amounts to two Hundred Bu&s;hels, which makes Twenty Five quarters of Corn. So that the fir&s;t year they must buy Corn, which is u&s;ually very plentiful. They may &s;o &s;oon as they come, buy <HI>Cows,</HI> more or le&s;s, as they want, or are able, which are to be had at ea&s;y rates. For <HI>Swine,</HI> they are plentiful and cheap; the&s;e will quickly Increa&s;e to a Stock. So that after the first year, what with the Poorer &s;ort, &s;ometimes labouring to others, and the more able <HI>Fi&s;hing, Fowling,</HI> and &s;ometime Buying; They may do very well, till their own Stocks are &s;ufficient to &s;upply them, and their Families, which will quickly be and to &s;pare, if they follow the <HI>Engli&s;h Husbandry,</HI> as they do in <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>New-York;</HI> and get Winter Fodder for their Stock.</P>
