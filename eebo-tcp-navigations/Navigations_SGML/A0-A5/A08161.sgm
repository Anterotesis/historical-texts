<HEAD>A COPIE OF THE FIRST LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>_SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I wrote to you at large on Sunday la&s;t and haue little to adde &s;ince, but am like to haue en|ough very &s;hortly, I pray God it proue good. The Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> was foure dayes &s;ince at <HI>Nidda</HI> in the land of <HI>He&s;&s;en,</HI> about fiue leagues from <HI>Francfort.</HI> Moun&s;uor <HI>Tilly</HI> &amp;c. are gone towards him, and if they be once on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Mayne, there will in all likely hood be blowes between them. Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> is not gone to the <HI>Gri&s;|&s;ons,</HI> but doth now a&s;&s;emble his forces a|gaine, vvith de&s;&s;eigne as vve iudge to be|&s;iege
<PB N="4" REF="3"><HI>Hagenaw</HI> againe, or el&s;e to fall downe to ioyne vvith his party, neither of vvhich mu&s;t be &s;uffered by the Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and he is likely therfore to go to the Arch|duke we hope to morrow, for as yet he ly|eth betweene the two riuers by the towne, and is not him&s;elfe well able to &s;tand. This is all we haue here.</P>
<P>From <HI>&V;ienna</HI> we haue that the Diot of <HI>Hungarie</HI> goeth not on the Emperours mind, and that the Turk is like to giue'vs peace here, we haue &s;mall &s;ignes of one el&s;e, and that is a bad one. The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> to obey his father, is minded a|gain&s;t his mind to &s;tay here or at <HI>Heydel|berg,</HI> in expectation of the i&s;&s;ue of the trea|tie at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.

<HEAD>A Copie of the &s;econd Letter.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t Letter you know that <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Tilly</HI> was then marching towards the Duke <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> then in the land of <HI>He&s;&s;en,</HI> not farre from <HI>Frankford.</HI> The Duke &s;oone after tooke <HI>Hoe&s;t</HI> a towne and ca&s;tle of the Elector of <HI>Ments,</HI> &s;tan|ding vpon the Mayne before <HI>Frankford,</HI> vvhere he had newes that <HI>Tilly</HI> and <HI>Gon|&s;ales</HI> ioyned and marched to him ouer the Mayne at <HI>A&s;chburg</HI> vvith an army of 40. m. as was giuen out, I thinke not much le&s;&s;e then 30. m. yet he re&s;olued to abide it rather then the hazard of a retrait. And they thereupon marched on furiou&s;ly by <HI>Hanaw</HI> and <HI>Frankford.</HI> The Duke in the meane time prouided him&s;elfe the be&s;t he could to receiue them, &s;eeing on the ad|uantage of the ground, intrenching him|&s;elfe, and burning the villages by which the enemy vvere to march to him. This done, he &s;ent hether to the Count of
<PB N="4" REF="4"><HI>Mansfeld,</HI> to let him know in what po&s;hire he &s;tood, and that he would doe the be&s;t he could to hold him&s;elfe &s;o, till the Count might march to him, for who&s;e pa&s;&s;age, or his owne retreate if he were forced to it, prepared to make a Bridge ouer the <HI>Mayne,</HI> This newes came to the Counte <HI>Mansfield</HI> as Hee was Marching ouer the Rhyne, with de&s;&s;eigne to haue gone to breake the bridge at <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> or that fayling, to haue made &s;ome other diuer&s;i|on on that &s;ide, thereby to haue ea&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wyck,</HI> by giuing <HI>Gonzales</HI> oc|ca&s;ion to looke backward. But herevpon Hee the &s;ame in&s;tant commaunded &s;ixtie troupes of hor&s;e to march ouer the Neccar towards the Duke intending to haue follo|wed him&s;elfe with the re&s;t of his army this day. But we haue this morning newes, that the Duke was beaten ye&s;terday. The maner and mea&s;ure of it. is yet variou&s;ly related, but I hope to adde it to this before I clo&s;e it. In the meane to doe all I may, again&s;t the &s;uddayne di&s;patch of the po&s;t, I hear|tely take leaue re&s;t.</P>

I mu&s;t clo&s;e this Letter and yet haue no more certaintie of the defeat of the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> but that hee never gaue Bat|tle, but having beene extreamly mole&s;ted by the Enemies Cannon, who had twelue peeces at lea&s;t, whereas the Duke had but two: through &s;ome confu&s;ion among his men hee was forced to retire ouer the Bridge he had made over the Maine, by the breaking whereof, many of his foote were drowned, others cut off being hin|dred by carriages, they all are lo&s;t as well of baggage as munition, &s;aving the Dukes owne wagons, wherein his money was, His Hor&s;e e&s;caped well, &s;ome ouer the Bridge, other are forced ouer the deepe that they were put to Swimme, by which meanes &s;ome number of them al&s;o are lo&s;t, and among them the Count <HI>Lene&s;tlin</HI> who married Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e <HI>Dudly,</HI> thought to bee one, the number can not yet be e&s;timated, but divers came hi|ther will not beleeue there were aboue one thou&s;and men lo&s;t, yet I doubt more, The re&s;t are retyring through the <HI>Berg&s;trate</HI> hither in great confu&s;ion, and I doubt
