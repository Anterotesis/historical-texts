<HEAD>THE VOYAGE ABOVT

<P>_EVer &s;ince Almighty God commanded
<HI>Adam</HI> to &s;ubdue the earth, there haue
not wanted in all ages, &s;ome heroicall &s;pi|rits,
which in obedience to that high man|date,
either from manife&s;t rea&s;on alluring
them, or by &s;ecret in&s;tinct inforcing them
thereunto, haue expended their wealth,
imployed their times, and aduentured their
per&s;ons, to finde out the true circuit thereof.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, &s;ome haue endeauored to effect this their purpo&s;e,
by conclu&s;ion and con&s;equence, drawne from the proportion
of the higher circles; to this nethermo&s;t globe, being the center
of the re&s;t. Others not contented with &s;choole points. and &s;uch
demon&s;trations (for that a &s;mall errour in the beginning, grow|eth
in the progre&s;&s;e to a great inconuenience) haue added there|unto
their owne hi&s;tory and experience. All of them in rea&s;on
haue de&s;erued great commendation of their owne ages, and
purcha&s;ed a iu&s;t renowne with all po&s;terity. For if a &s;urueyer of
&s;ome few Lord&s;hips, whereof the bounds and limits were before
knowne, worthily de&s;erue his reward, not onely for his trauell,
but for his skill al&s;o, in mea&s;uring the whole and euerie part
thereof: how much more, aboue compari&s;on, are their famous
trauells by all meanes po&s;&s;ible to be eternized, who haue be&s;tow|ed
their &s;tudies and indeauor, to &s;uruey and mea&s;ure this globe
allmo&s;t vnmea&s;urable? Neither is here that difference to be ob|iected,

<P>And therefore that valiant enterpri&s;e, accompanied with
happy &s;ucce&s;&s;e, which that right rare and thrice worthy Cap|taine
<HI>Francis Drake</HI> atcheiued, in fir&s;t turning vp a furrow about

hereof let po&s;terity iudge.</P>
<P>It &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, be deemed a &s;ufficient di&s;charge of duty,

giue leaue) to beare backe to Plimmouth againe, where wee all

<P>As &s;oone as we were out of &s;ight of land, our generall gaue
vs occa&s;ion to coniecture in part, whither he intended, both by
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the directing of his cour&s;e, and appointing the <HI>Randeuous</HI> (if
any &s;hould bee &s;euered from the fleet) to be the Iland <HI>Mo|gadore.</HI>
And &s;o &s;ailing with fauorable windes, the fir&s;t land that
wee had &s;ight of, was <HI>Cape Cantine</HI> in <HI>Barbarie December 25.
Chri&s;tmas</HI> day in the morning.<MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="Dec."> The &s;hoare is faire white &s;and,
and the inland contrie very high and mountainous, it lieth in
32. deg. 30. mi. north latitude, and &s;o coa&s;ting from hence
&s;outhward, about 18. leagues, we arriued the &s;ame day at
<HI>Mogadore</HI> the Iland before named.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mogadore,</HI> lies vnder the dominion of the king of <HI>Fe&s;&s;e</HI> in
31. deg. 40. mi. about a mile off from the &s;hoare, by this meanes
making a good harbor betweene the land and it. It is vninhabi|ted,
of about a league in circuit, not very high land, all ouer|growne
with a kinde of &s;hrub bre&s;t high, not much vnlike our
priuet, verie full of Doues and therefore much frequented of
Go&s;haukes, and &s;uch like birds of prey, be&s;ides diuers &s;orts of
&s;ea-foule very plentie. At the &s;outh &s;ide of this Iland are three
hollow rocks, vnder which are great &s;tore of very whole&s;ome
but very vglie fi&s;h to looke to. Lying here about a mile from
the maine, a boate was &s;ent to &s;ound the harbor, and finding it
&s;afe, and in the very entrance on the north &s;ide about 5. or 6.
fathome water (but at the &s;outher &s;ide it is very dangerous) we
brought in our whole fleet <HI>December</HI> 27. and continued there
till the la&s;t day of the &s;ame moneth, imploying our lea&s;ure, the
meane while,<MILESTONE UNIT="Decemb."> in &s;etting vp a pinnace, one of the 4. brought from
home in peices with vs. Our abode here was &s;oone perceiued by
the inhabitants of the contrie, who comming to the &s;hoare, by
&s;ignes and cries made &s;hewe, that they de&s;ired to be fetched a|board,
to whom our generall &s;ent a boate, into which 2. of the
chiefe&s;t of the <HI>Moores</HI> were pre&s;ently receiued, and one man
of ours, in exchange, left a land, as a pledge for their returne.</P>
<P>They that came aboard were right courteou&s;ly entertained,
with a daintie banquet, and &s;uch gifts as they &s;eemed to be mo&s;t
glad of, that they might thereby vnder&s;tand, that this fleete
came in peace and friend&s;hip, offering to traffique with them,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
for &s;uch commodities as their contrie yeelded, to their owne
content. This offer they &s;eemed mo&s;t gladly to accept, and pro|mi&s;ed,
the next day, to re&s;ort againe, with &s;uch things as they
had to exchange for ours. It is a law among&s;t them to drinke no
wine, notwith&s;tanding by &s;tealth it plea&s;eth them well to haue
it abundantly, as here was experience. At their returne a&s;hoare,
they quietly re&s;tored the pledge which they had &s;tayed, and the
next day, at the houre appointed, returning againe, brought
with them Camells, in &s;hewe loaden with wares to be exchan|ged
for our commodities, and calling for a boate in ha&s;te, had
one &s;ent them, according to order, which our generall (being at
this pre&s;ent ab&s;ent) had giuen before his departure to the
Iland.</P>
<P>Our boate comming to the place of landing (which was a|mong
the rocks) one of our men called <HI>Iohn Fry,</HI> mi&s;tru&s;ting no
danger, nor fearing any harme pretended by them, and there|fore
intending to become a pledge, according to the order v&s;ed
the day before, readilie &s;tept out of the boate and ranne a land,
which oportunitie (being that which the <HI>Moores</HI> did looke for)
they tooke the aduantage of, and not onely they which were in
&s;ight, layed hands on him to carrie him away with them, but a
number more, which lay &s;ecretly hidden, did forth with breake
forth from behinde the rocks, whither they had conueyed them|&s;elues
(as it &s;eemeth the night before) forcing our men to leaue
the re&s;cuing of him that was taken as captiue, and with &s;peed to
&s;hift for them&s;elues.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this violence, was a de&s;ire which the king of
<HI>Fe&s;&s;e</HI> had, to vnder&s;tand what this fleet was, whether any fore|runner
of the kings of <HI>Portugall</HI> or no, and what newes of cer|taintie
the fleet might giue him. And therefore after that he was
brought to the kings pre&s;ence, and had reported that they were
Engli&s;hmen, bound for the &s;traights, vnder the conduct of
generall <HI>Drake,</HI> he was &s;ent back againe with a pre&s;ent to his
Captaine and offer of great curte&s;ie and freind&s;hip, if he would
v&s;e his contry But in this meane time, the generall being grieued
with this &s;hew of iniurie, and intending, if he might, to recouer
<PB N="6" REF="8">
or redeeme his man, his pinnace being ready, landed his com|pany,
and marched &s;omewhat into the countrie, without any
re&s;i&s;tance made again&s;t him: neither would the <HI>Moores,</HI> by any
meanes come nigh our men, to deale with them any way;
wherefore hauing made proui&s;ion of wood, as al&s;o vi&s;ited an old
fort, built &s;ometime by the king of <HI>Portugall,</HI> but now ruined by
the king of <HI>Fe&s;&s;e,</HI> we departed <HI>December</HI> 31.<MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="Dec."> towards <HI>Cape
Blanck,</HI> in &s;uch &s;ort, that when <HI>Fry</HI> returned, he found to his
great griefe, that the fleet was gone: but yet, by the kings fauor,
he was &s;ent home into <HI>England</HI> not long after, in an Engli&s;h
Merchants &s;hip.</P>
<P>Shortly after our putting forth of this harbour, we were met
with contrary windes and foule weather, which continued till
the fourth of Ianuary: yet we &s;till held on our cour&s;e, and the
third day after,<MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Ian."> fell with cape <HI>De Guerre</HI> in 30. deg. min. where
wee lighted on 3. Spani&s;h fi&s;hermen called <HI>Caunters,</HI> whom
we tooke with our new pinnace, and caried along with vs, till
we came to <HI>Rio Del Oro,</HI><MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="Ian."> iu&s;t vnder the Tropick of Cancer:
where with our pinnace al&s;o we took a caruell. From hence, till
the fifteenth day,<MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="Ian."> we failed on towards cape <HI>Barbas,</HI> where the
Marigold tooke a caruell more, and &s;o onward to cape <HI>Blanck</HI>
till the next day at night.<MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="Ian."></P>
<P>This cape lieth in 20. deg. 30. min. &s;hewing it &s;elfe vpright
like the corner of a wall, to them that come towards it from the
North, hauing, betweene it and cape <HI>Barbas,</HI> lowe, &s;andy, and
very white land all the way. Here we ob&s;erued the &s;outh <HI>Guards,</HI>
called the <HI>Cro&s;iers</HI> 9. deg. 30. min. aboue the horizon. Within
the cape, we tooke one &s;pani&s;h &s;hip more riding at anchor (all
her men being fled a&s;hoare in the boate &s;aue two) which, with|all
the re&s;t we had formerly taken, we caried into the harbor, 3.
leagues within the cape.</P>
<P>Here our generall determined, for certaine dayes to make
his abode, both for that the place afforded plenty of fre&s;h vic|tualls,
for the pre&s;ent refre&s;hing of our men, and for their fu|ture
&s;upply at &s;ea (by rea&s;on of the infinite &s;tore of diuers &s;orts of
<PB N="7" REF="8">
good fi&s;h, which are there ea&s;ie to be taken, euen within the
harbor, the like whereof, is hardly to be found againe, in any
part of the world) as al&s;o, becau&s;e it &s;erued very fitly, for the di&s;|patching
of &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;&s;es that we had. During the time
of our abode in this place, our generall being a&s;hoare was vi&s;i|ted
by certaine of the people of the country, who brought
downe with them a woman a <HI>Moore</HI> (with her little babe han|ging
vpon her dry dugge, hauing &s;carce life in her&s;elfe, much
le&s;&s;e milke to nouri&s;h her child) to be &s;ould as a hor&s;e, or a cow
and calfe by her &s;ide, in which &s;ort of merchandi&s;e our generall
would not deale. But they had al&s;o Amber-greece, with cer|taine
gummes of &s;ome e&s;timation, which they brought to ex|change
with our men for water (whereof they haue great want)
&s;o that comming with their <HI>Allforges</HI> (they are leathern bags
holding liquor) to buy water, they cared not at what price they
bought it, &s;o they might haue to quench their thir&s;t. A very hea|uie
iudgement of God vpon that coa&s;t! The circum&s;tances
whereof con&s;idered, our generall would receiue nothing of
them for water, but freely gaue it them that came to him, yea
and fed them al&s;o ordinarily with our victualls, in eating where|of,
their manner was not onely vnciuill, and vn&s;ightly to vs, but
euen inhumane and loath&s;ome in it &s;elfe.</P>
<P>And hauing wa&s;hed and trimd our &s;hips, and di&s;charged all
our &s;pani&s;h pri&s;es, excepting one <HI>Caunter</HI> (for which we gaue to
the owner one of our owne &s;hips viz. the Chri&s;topher) and one
caruell formerly bound to Saint <HI>Iago,</HI> which we cau&s;ed to acom|panie
vs hither, where &s;hee al&s;o was di&s;charged: <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="Ian."> after 6. dayes
abode here, we departed, directing our cour&s;e for the Ilands of
cape <HI>Verde,</HI> where (if any where) we were of nece&s;&s;ity to &s;tore
our fleet with fre&s;h water, for a long time, for that our generall
intended from thence to runne a long cour&s;e (euen to the coa&s;t
of <HI>Bra&s;ill</HI>) without touch of land. And now, hauing the winde
con&s;tant at <HI>North Ea&s;t &amp; East North Ea&s;t,</HI> which is v&s;uall about
tho&s;e parts, becau&s;e it bloweth almo&s;t continually from the

<PB N="8" REF="9">
after, we came to anchor vnder the We&s;ter part (towards Saint
<HI>Iago</HI>) of the Iland <HI>Maio,</HI><MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="Ian."> it lyeth in 15. deg. oo. high land, &s;a|uing
that the North-we&s;t part &s;tretcheth out into the &s;ea, the
&s;pace of a league very low, and is inhabited by &s;ubiects to the
king of Portugall.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="Ian."> Here landing, in hope of traffique with the inhabitants for
water, we found a Towne, not farre from the waters &s;ide, of a
great number of de&s;olate and ruinous hou&s;es, with a poore na|ked
Chappell or Oratory, &s;uch as &s;mall co&s;t and charge might
&s;erue and &s;uffice, being to &s;mall purpo&s;e, and as it &s;eemeth one|ly
to make a &s;hew, and that a fal&s;e &s;hew, contrary to the nature
of a &s;carcrow, which feareth birds from comming nigh; this en|ti&s;eth
&s;uch as pa&s;&s;e by to hale in, and looke for commodity,
which is not at all to be found there; though in the inner parts
of the Iland it be in great abundance.</P>
<P>For when wee found the &s;prings and wells which had beene
there (as appeared) &s;topped vp againe, and no other water, to
purpo&s;e, to bee had to &s;erue our need, we marched vp to &s;eeke
&s;ome more conuenient place to &s;upply our want, or at lea&s;t to
&s;ee whether the people would be dealt withal, to helpe vs there|in.
In this trauelling, we found the &s;oile to be very fruitfull, ha|uing
euery where plenty of figgetrees, with fruite vpon mo&s;t of
them. But in the vallies and low ground, where little low cotta|ges
were built, were plea&s;ant vineyards planted, bearing then,
ripe and mo&s;t plea&s;ant grapes. There were al&s;o tall trees, without
any branch till the top, which bare the <HI>Coco nuts.</HI> There were
al&s;o great &s;tore of certaine lower trees, with long and broad

Ea&s;t Indies, Binny, Calecut. &amp;c.) and a place of rare force, if it
were not for the cau&s;e afore-recited, which hath much abated
the pride, and cooled the courage of that people, who (vnder

of leades, there could no ground be had at any hand, nei|ther
was it euer knowne (as is reported) that any line would

<P>The truth is, wee often met with aduer&s;e winds, vn welcome

of &s;ultring heat, not without the affrights of fla&s;hing lightnings,
and terrifyings of often claps of thunder; yet &s;til with the admix|ture
of many comforts. For this we could not but take notice of,

<P>Among the many &s;trange creatures which we &s;awe, we tooke
heedfull notice of one, as &s;trange as any; to wit, the flying fi&s;h,
a fi&s;h of the bignes and proportion, of a rea&s;onable or middle
&s;ort of Pilchards: hee hath finnes, of the length of his whole
body, from the bulk to the top of the taile, bearing the forme,
and &s;upplying the like v&s;e to him, that wings doe to other crea|tures.
By the helpe of the&s;e finnes, whe~ he is cha&s;ed of the <HI>Bonito,</HI>
or great mackrel (whom the <HI>Aurata</HI> or dolphin likewi&s;e pur&s;ueth)
and hath not &s;trength to e&s;cape by &s;wimming any longer, hee
lifteth vp him&s;elfe aboue the water, and flieth a pretty height,
&s;ometimes lighting into boates or barkes as they &s;aile along:
The quills of their wings are &s;o proportionable, and finelie &s;et
together, with a mo&s;t thinne and dainty filme, that they might
&s;eeme to &s;erue, for a much longer and higher flight, but the drie|nes
of them is &s;uch, after &s;ome 10. or 12. &s;trokes, that hee mu&s;t
needs into the water againe to moi&s;ten them, which el&s;e would
grow &s;tiffe and vnfit for motion. The inrea&s;e of this little and
wonderfull creature is in manner infinite, the fry whereof lieth
vpon the vpper part of the waters, in the heate of the Sun, as
du&s;t vpon the face of the earth, which being in bigne&s;&s;e of a
wheat &s;traw, and length an inch more or le&s;&s;e, do continually
exerci&s;e them&s;elues in both their faculties of nature: wherein,
if the Lord had not made them expert indeed, their generation
could not haue continued, being &s;o de&s;ired a prey to &s;o many,

which greedily hunt after them, forcing them to e&s;cape in the

Neither are they allwayes free, or without danger, in their fly|ing;
but as they e&s;cape one euill, by refu&s;ing the waters &s;o they

fi&s;h as he can come by at aduantage, in their &s;wimming in the
brim of the waters, or leaping aboue the &s;ame, pre&s;ently cea&s;eth
vpon them with great violence, making great havock, e&s;pecially

Aprill 5. we fell with the coa&s;t of Bra&s;ill, in 31. deg. 30. min.
towards the pole Antartick, where the land is lowe neere the

aboue 12. fathome, 3. leagues off from the &s;hoare: and being
de&s;cried by the inhabitants, we &s;awe great and huge fires,
made by them in &s;undry plaes. Which order of making fires,
though it be vniuer&s;all, as well among Chri&s;tians as heathens,
yet is it not likely that many doe v&s;e it to that end, which the
Bra&s;ilians doe: to wit, for a &s;acrifice to Deuills, whereat they&punc;
intermixe many and diuers ceremonies of coniurations, ca&s;ting

make wrack of them, whereof the Portugalls by the lo&s;&s;e of di|uers
of their &s;hips, haue had often experience.</P>
<P>In the reports of Magellanes voyage, it is &s;aid, that this peo|ple

wonderfull alteration in them, &s;ince that time, being fallen from
a &s;imple and naturall creature, to make Gods of Deuills; But
I am of the minde, that it was with them then, as now it is, one|ly
they lacked then the like occa&s;ion, to put it in practi&s;e which
now they haue: for then, they liued as a free people among
them&s;elues, but now, are in mo&s;t mi&s;erable bondage and &s;lauery,
both in body, goods, wife, and children, and life it &s;elf to the
Portugalls, who&s;e hard and mo&s;t cruell dealings again&s;t them,
forceth them to flie, into the more vnfruitful parts of their owne
land, rather there to &s;tarue, or at lea&s;t liue mi&s;erably with liber|tie,
then to abide &s;uch intollerable bondage, as they lay vpon
them v&s;ing the afore&s;aid practi&s;es with deuills, both for a re|uenge
again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, and al&s;o for a defence, that they
haue no further entrance into the country. And &s;uppo&s;ing in|deed,
that no other had v&s;ed trauell by &s;ea in &s;hips, but their
enemies onely, they therefore v&s;ed the &s;ame at our comming:
notwit&s;tanding, our God made their deuili&s;h intent of none ef|fect;
For albeit there lacked not (within the &s;pace of our falling
with this coa&s;t) forcible &s;tormes and tempe&s;ts, yet did we &s;u&s;t|aine
no dammage, but onely the &s;eperating of our &s;hips, out of
&s;ight for a few dayes. Here our generall would haue gone a|&s;hore,
but we could finde no harbor in many leagues. And
therefore coa&s;ting along the land, towards the &s;outh, Aprill 7.<MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Apr.">
we had a violent &s;torme, for the &s;pace of 3. houres, With thun|der,

with all the conuenient &s;peed that could be made, and to
&s;tay one for another, if it &s;hould happen that we could not ar|riue
there all together; and the effect wee found an&s;werable to
our expectations, for here our &s;euered &s;hip (as hath beene de|clared)

<P><MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="May"> The next day May 14. the weather being faire, and the

into that roade: whereby at la&s;t, they were all a&s;&s;embled, ex|cepting

&s;torme, the night before, had now lo&s;t company, and was not
found againe in a long time after.</P>
<P>In this place (the people being remoued vp into the country,
belike for feare of our comming) we found neere vnto the rocks,
in hou&s;es made for that purpo&s;e, as al&s;o in diuers other places,
great &s;tore of O&s;triches at lea&s;t to the number of 50. with much
other foule; &s;ome dried and &s;ome in drying for their proui&s;ion,
as it &s;eemed, to carrie with them to the place of their dwel|lings.
The O&s;triches thighs were in bignes equall to rea&s;onable
legs of murton, They cannot flie at all; but they runne &s;o &s;wiftly,
and take &s;o long &s;trides, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for a man in run|ning
by any meanes to take them, neither yet to come &s;o nigh
them, as to haue any &s;hot at them either with bow or peece:
Whereof our men had often proofe on other parts of that coa&s;t

or in&s;truments which the people v&s;e in taking them.</P>
<P>Among other meanes they v&s;e in betraying the&s;e O&s;triches,
they haue a great and large plume of feathers, orderly com|pact
together vpon the end of a &s;taffe; in the forepart bearing the
likene&s;&s;e of the head, necke, and bulke of an O&s;trich; and in the
hinder part, &s;preading it &s;elfe out very large, &s;ufficient (being hol|den
before him) to hide the mo&s;t part of the body of a man:
With this it &s;eemeth they &s;taulke, driuing them into &s;ome &s;traite

countrey is very plea&s;ant, and &s;eemeth to be a fruitfull &s;oyle.</P>
<P>Being afterwards driuen to fall with this place againe, we had
great acquaintance and familiarity with the people, who reioy|ced
greatly in our comming, and in our friend&s;hip, in that wee
had done them no harme. But becau&s;e this place was no fit or
conuenient harbor for vs, to do our nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ines; neither
yet to make proui&s;ion, of &s;uch things as we wanted, as water,
wood, and &s;uch like, we departed thence the 15. of May.<MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="May"></P>
<P>At our departure hence, we held our cour&s;e South and by

little &s;ayle, that our fleet might the ea&s;ier gett vp with vs, Which
by rea&s;on of the contrary windes, were ca&s;t a &s;terne of vs.</P>
<P>In 47. deg. 30. min. we found a bay, which was faire, &s;afe,
and beneficiall to vs, very nece&s;&s;ary for our v&s;e; into which
we haled, and anchored <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="May"> May 17. and the next day <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="May"> May 18. we
came further into the &s;ame bay, where we ca&s;t anchor, and made
our abode full fifteene dayes.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t day of our arriuall here, our generall hauing &s;et
things in &s;ome order, for the di&s;patch of our nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ines,
being mo&s;t carefull for his two &s;hips which were wanting, &s;ent
forth to the &s;outhward, Captaine Winter in the Elizabeth vice|admiral;
him&s;elf in the admiral, going forth northward, into the

at which time, by the good prouidence of God, hee him&s;elfe
met with the Swanne, formerly lo&s;t at our departure from the
riuer of Plate, and brought her into the &s;ame harbor, the &s;ame
day: where being afterward vnloaden, and di&s;charged of her
fraight, &s;hee was ca&s;t off, and her iron worke, and other nece&s;&s;|aries
being &s;aued, for the better proui&s;ion of the re&s;t; of the re|mainder
was made fire wood, and other implements which we
wanted. But all this while, of the other &s;hip which wee lo&s;t &s;o
lately, in our extremitie, we could haue no newes.</P>
<P>While we were thus employed, after certaine dayes of our
&s;tay in this place, being on &s;hoare, in an Iland, nigh vnto the
<PB N="21" REF="15">
maine, where at lowe water was free pa&s;&s;age on foot, from the
one to the other; the people of the country did &s;hew them&s;elues
vnto vs, with leaping, dancing, and holding vp their hands, and
making ourcries after their manner: but being then high water,
we could not go ouer to them on foot. Wherefore the Generall
cau&s;ed immediatly a boat to bee in readine&s;&s;e, and &s;ent vnto
them &s;uch things as he thought would delight them; as kniues,
bells, bugles, &amp;c. whereupon they beeing a&s;&s;embled together
vpon a hill, halfe an Engli&s;h mile from the waters &s;ide; &s;ent
downe two of their company, running one after the other with
a great grace, trauer&s;ing their ground as it &s;eemed after the man|ner
of their warres, by degrees de&s;cending towards the waters
&s;ide very &s;wiftly. Notwith&s;tanding drawing nigh vnto it, they
made a &s;tay, refu&s;ing to come neere our men: which our men
perceiuing, &s;ent &s;uch things as they had tyed with a &s;tring vpon
a rod, and &s;tucke the &s;ame vp a rea&s;onable di&s;tance from them,
where they might &s;ee it. And a&s;&s;oone as our men were departed
from the place, they came and tooke tho&s;e things, leauing in|&s;tead
of them, as in recompence, &s;uch feathers as they v&s;e to
weare about their heads, with a bone made in manner of a tooth|pick,
carued round about the top, and in length about &s;ix inches,
being very &s;moothly burni&s;hed. Whereupon our Generall, with
diuers of his gentlemen and companie, at low water went ouer
to them to the maine.</P>
<P>Again&s;t his comming they remained &s;till vpon the hill, and
&s;et them&s;elues in a ranke, one by one; appointing one of their
company to runne before them from the one end of the ranke
to the other, and &s;o backe againe, continually Ea&s;t and We&s;t,
with holding vp his hands ouer his head, and yeelding forward
his body in his running toward the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the
Sunne: and at euery &s;econd or third turne at the mo&s;t, erected
his body, agin&s;t the mid&s;t of the ranke of the people, lifting
him&s;elfe vaulting-wi&s;e from the ground towards the Moone,
being then ouer our heads: &s;ignifying thereby, as we conceiued,
that they called the Sunne and Moone (whom they &s;erue for
<PB N="22" REF="16">
gods) to witne&s;&s;e, that they meant nothing towards vs but peace.
But when they perceiued that we a&s;cended the hill apace, and
drew nigh vnto them, they &s;eemed very fearefull of our com|ming.</P>
<P>Wherefore our Generall not willing, to giue them any way
any occa&s;ion to mi&s;like, or be di&s;comfited, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">etyred his company;
wherby they were &s;o allured, and did &s;o therein confirme them|&s;elues
of vs, that we were no enemies, neither meant them harm,
that without al feare diuers came down with great &s;peed after vs,
pre&s;ently entring into traffique with our men. Notwith&s;tanding
they would receiue nothing at our hands but the &s;ame mu&s;t be
fir&s;t ca&s;t vpon the ground, v&s;ing this word, <HI>Zu&s;&s;us,</HI> for exchange
<HI>T&oacute;ytt</HI> to ca&s;t vpon the ground. And if they mi&s;liked any thing,
they cryed <HI>Cor&oacute;h. Cor&oacute;h,</HI> &s;peaking the &s;ame with ratling in the
throat. The wares we receiued from them were arrowes of reeds,
feathers, and &s;uch bones as are afore de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This people go naked, except a skin of furre which they ca&s;t
about their &s;houlders, when they &s;it or lye in the cold: but ha|uing
any thing to do, as going or any other labour, they v&s;e it as
a girdle about their loynes. They weare their haire very long, but
le&s;t it might trouble them in their trauell, they knit it vp with a
roll of O&s;trich feathers, v&s;ing the &s;ame rolls and haire together
for a quiuer for their arrowes, and for a &s;tore hou&s;e, in which
they carry the mo&s;t things which they carry about them. Some
of them within the&s;e rolls &s;ticke on either &s;ide of their heads
(for a &s;igne of honour in their per&s;ons) a large and plaine feather
&s;hewing like hornes afarre off: So that &s;uch a head vpon a naked
body (if diuels do appeare with hornes) might very nigh re&s;em|ble
diuels.</P>
<P>Their whole brauery and &s;etting out them&s;elues &s;tandeth in
painting their bodies with diuers colours, and &s;uch workes as
they can deui&s;e. Some wa&s;h their faces with &s;ulphure, or &s;ome
&s;uch like &s;ub&s;tance: &s;ome paint their whole bodies black, leauing
onely their neckes behind and before White, much like our da|mo&s;els
that weare their &s;quares, their neckes and brea&s;ts naked.
<PB N="23" REF="16">
Some paint one &s;houlder blacke, another white&punc; and their &s;ides
and legs interchangeably, with the &s;ame colours, one &s;till con|trary
to the other. The black part hath &s;et vpon it white moones,
and the white part blacke Suns, being the marks and characters
of their gods, as is before noted.</P>
<P>They haue &s;ome commodity by painting of their bodies, for
the which cau&s;e they v&s;e it &s;o generally: and that I gather to be
the defence it yeeldeth again&s;t the piercing and nipping cold.
For the colours being clo&s;e layd on vpon their skinne, or rather
in their fle&s;h, as by continuall renewing of the&s;e iuyces which
are layed on, &s;oakt into the inner part thereof, doth fill vp the
pores &s;o clo&s;e that no aire or cold can enter, or make them once
to &s;hrinke.</P>
<P>They haue cleane, comely, and &s;trong bodies: they are &s;wift
of foot, and &s;eeme very actiue. Neither is any thing more la|mentable
(in my iudgement) then that &s;o goodly a people, and
&s;o liuely creatures of God, &s;hould bee ignorant of the true and
liuing God. And &s;o much the more is this to be lamented, by
how much they are more tractable, and ea&s;ie to be brought to
the &s;heepfold of Chri&s;t: hauing in truth a land &s;ufficient to re|compence
any Chri&s;tian Prince in the world, for the whole tra|uell
and labour, co&s;t and charges be&s;towed in that behalfe: with
a wonderfull enlarging of a kingdome, be&s;ides the glory of God
by encrea&s;ing of the Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Its wonderfull to heare, being neuer knowne to Chri&s;tians
before this time, how familiar they became in &s;hort &s;pace with
vs; thinking them&s;elues to be ioyned with &s;uch a people, as they
ought rather to &s;erue, then offer any wrong or iniurie vnto. Pre|&s;uming
that they might be bold with our Generall as with a Fa|ther,
and with vs as with brethren and their neere&s;t friends; nei|ther
&s;eemed their loue le&s;&s;e towards vs. One of the chiefe&s;t
among them hauing on a time receiued a cap of our Generals
head, which he did daily weare, remouing him&s;elfe but a little
from vs, with an arrow pierced his legge deepely, cau&s;ing the
bloud to &s;treame out vpon the ground: &s;ignifying thereby, how
<PB N="24" REF="17">
vnfainedly he loued him, and giuing therin a couenant of peace:
The number of men which here did frequent our companie,
were about fiftie per&s;ons. Within, in the Southermo&s;t part of
this bay, there is a riuer of fre&s;h water, with a great many profi|table
Ilands; of which, &s;ome haue alwaies &s;uch &s;tore of Seales or
&s;ea-wo&s;ues as were able to maintaine a huge army of men. Other
Ilands being many and great, are &s;o repleni&s;hed with birds and
foule, as if there were no other victuals, a wonderfull multitude
of people might be nouri&s;hed by the increa&s;e of them for many
po&s;terities. Of the&s;e we killed &s;ome with &s;hot, and &s;ome with
&s;tatus, and tooke &s;ome with our hands, from mens heads and
&s;houlders vpon which they lighted. We could not perceiue that
the people of the countrey had any &s;ort of boate or canowe, to
come to the&s;e Ilands. Their owne proui&s;ion which they eate,
for ought we could perceiue, was commonly raw. For we &s;hould
&s;ometimes find the remnants of Seales all bloudy which they
had gnawne with their teeth like dogs: They go all of them ar|med,
with a &s;hort bow of about an ell in length in their hands,
with arrowes of reeds, and headed with a flint &s;tone, very cun|ningly
cut and fa&s;tned.</P>
<P>This bay by rea&s;on of the plenty of <HI>Seales</HI> therein found (in|&s;omuch
that we killed two hundred in the &s;pace of one houre)
we called <HI>Seale, bay.</HI> And hauing now made &s;ufficient proui&s;ion

Pre&s;ently vpon his landing he was vi&s;ited by two of the inhabi|tants

to withdrawe them, and to turne them to become our e|nemies;
Which our generall with his men not &s;u&s;pecting in the~,
v&s;ed them as before: and one Mr. Robert Winter, thinking of
plea&s;ure to &s;hoote an arrow at length, as Mr. Oliuer had done
before, that he which came la&s;t al&s;o might haue a &s;ight thereof,
the &s;tring of his bow brake; which, as before it was a terror vn|to

boldnes, and as they thought, great aduantage in their treache|rous
intent and purpo&s;e; not imagining that our calliuers,
&s;words, and targets, were any munition or weapon of warre.</P>
<P>In which per&s;wa&s;ion (as the generall with his companie

which had the bowe, not &s;uffering him to &s;tring the &s;ame a|gaine,
which he was about to haue done, as well as hee could:
but being wounded in the &s;houlder at the fir&s;t &s;hot, and turning

fell not. But the Mr. gunner being ready to &s;hoote of his calli|uer,
which tooke not fire in leuelling thereof, was pre&s;ently
&s;laine out right. In this extremitie, if our generall had not beene
both expert in &s;uch affaires, able to judge, and giue pre&s;ent di|rection
in the danger thereof, and had not valiantly thru&s;t him|&s;elfe
into the dance, again&s;t the&s;e mon&s;ters, there had no one of
our men, that there were landed, e&s;caped with life. He there|fore,
giuing order that no man &s;hould keepe any certaine
ground, but &s;hift from place to place, encroaching &s;till vpon the
enemie, v&s;ing their targets, and other weapons for the defence
of their bodies, and that they &s;hould breake &s;o many arrowes, as
by any meanes they could come by, being &s;hot at them; where|in
he him&s;elfe was very diligent, and carefull al&s;o in calling on
them, knowing that their arrowes being once &s;pent, they &s;hould
haue the&s;e enemies at their deuotion and plea&s;ure, to kill or
&s;aue, and this order being accordingly taken, him&s;elfe I &s;ay with
a good courage and tru&s;t in the true and liuing God, taking and
&s;hooting off, the &s;ame peece, which the gunner could not make
to take fire, di&s;patched the fir&s;t beginner of the quarrell, the &s;ame
man which &s;lewe our Mr. gunner. For the peece being charged
with a bullet, and haile &s;hot, and well aimed, tare out his bellie
and gutts, with great torment, as it &s;eemed by his cry, which
was &s;o hideous and horrible a roare, as if ten bulls had ioyned
together in roaring, wherewith the courage of his partners was
&s;o abated, and their hearts appalled, that notwith&s;tanding, di|uer&s;e
of their fellowes and countriemen appeared out of the
woods, on each &s;ide: yet they were glad, by flying away, to
&s;aue them&s;elues, quietly &s;uffering our men either to depart or
&s;tay. Our generall cho&s;e rather to depart, then to take further
reuenge of them, which now he might, by rea&s;on of his woun|ded
man, whom for many good parts he loued dearely; and
therefore would rather haue &s;aued him, then &s;laine an hundred
enemies, but being pa&s;t recouery, he died the 2. day, after his
being brought aboard againe.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="19">
That night our Mr. gunners body being left a&s;hoare, for the
&s;peedier bringing of the other aboard, our generall him&s;elfe the
next day, with his boate well appointed, turned to the &s;hoare,
to fetch it likewi&s;e: which they found lying where it was left,
but &s;tript of his vppermo&s;t garment, and hauing an engli&s;h ar|row
&s;tucke in his right eye.</P>
<P>Both of the&s;e dead bodies were layd together in one graue,
with &s;uch reuerence, as was fit for the earthen tabernacles of
immortall &s;oules; and with &s;uch commendable ceremonies, as
belong vnto &s;ouldiers of worth, in time of warre, which they
mo&s;t truly and rightfully de&s;erued.</P>
<P>Magellane was not altogether deceiued, in naming them
Giants; for they generally differ from the common &s;ort of
men, both in &s;tature, bignes, and &s;trength of body, as al&s;o in
the hideou&s;ne&s;&s;e of their voice: but yet they are nothing &s;o
mon&s;trous, or giantlike as they were reported; there being
&s;ome Engli&s;h men, as tall, as the highe&s;t of any that we could
&s;ee, but peraduenture, the Spaniards did not thinke, that euer,
any Engli&s;h man would come thither, to reproue them; and
therevpon might pre&s;ume the more boldly to lie: the name
<HI>Pentagones, Fiue cubits</HI> viz. 7. foote and halfe, de&s;cribing the full
height (if not &s;ome what more) of the highe&s;t of them.</P>
<P>But this is certaine, that the Spani&s;h cruelties there v&s;ed,
haue made them more mon&s;trous, in minde and manners, then
they are in body; and more inho&s;pitable, to deale with any
&s;trangers, that &s;hall come hereafter. For the lo&s;&s;e of their friends
(the reme~brance wherof is a&s;&s;igned and conueighed ouer from
one generation to another, among their po&s;teritie) breedeth an
old grudge, which will not ea&s;ily be forgotten, with &s;o quarrell|&s;ome
and revengefull a people. Notwith&s;tanding the terrour
which they had conceiued of vs, did henceforward &s;o quench
their heate, and take downe their edge, that they both for|gate
reuenge, and &s;eeming by their countenance, to repent
them of the wrong they had offered vs, that meant them no
harme, &s;uffered vs to doe what we would, the whole &s;pace of
<PB N="29" REF="19">
two monethes after this, without any interruption or mole&s;ta|tion
by them, and it may perhaps be a meanes, to breede
a peace in that people, towards all that may hereafter this,
come that way.</P>
<P>To this euill, thus receiued at the hands of infidells, there was
adioyned, and grew another mi&s;chiefe, wrought and contriued
clo&s;ely among&s;t our &s;elues, as great, yea farre greater, and of farre
more greiuous con&s;equence then the former: but that it was,
by Gods prouidence, detected and preuented in time, which
el&s;e had extended it &s;elfe, not onely to the violent &s;hedding of
innocent blood, by murthering our generall and &s;uch others as
were mo&s;t firme and faithfull to him: but al&s;o to the finall ouer|throw
of the whole action intended, and to diuers other mo&s;t
dangerous effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e plotts had beene layd before the voyage beganne in
England: the very modell of them was &s;hewed, and declared to
our generall in his garden at Plimmouth, before his &s;etting &s;ayle,
which yet he either would not credit, as true or likely, of a per|&s;on
whom he loued &s;o deerely, and was per&s;waded of to loue
him likewi&s;e vnfainedly, or thought by loue and benefits, to re|moue
and remedy it, if there were any euill purpo&s;es conceiued
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And therfore, he did not onely continue (to this &s;u&s;pected &amp;
accu&s;ed per&s;on) al countenance, credit, and courte&s;ies, which he
was wont to &s;hew &amp; giue him, but encrea&s;ed them, v&s;ing him in
a manner as another him&s;elfe, and as his mo&s;t inmo&s;t friend:
lodging him with him&s;elfe; giuing him the &s;econd place, in all
companies, in his pre&s;ence; leauing in his hand, the &s;tate as it
were of his owne per&s;on; in his ab&s;ence; imparting vnto him
all his coun&s;ells; allowing him free liberty in all things, that
were rea&s;onable; and bearing often, at his hands great infirmi|ties;
yea de&s;pi&s;ing, that any priuate iniury, &s;hould breake &s;o
firme a friend&s;hip, as he meant towards him. And therefore, was
he often times not a little offended, euen with tho&s;e, who (vpon
con&s;cience of their duty, and knowledge that otherwi&s;e they
<PB N="30" REF="20">
&s;hould indeed offend) di&s;clo&s;ed from time to time vnto him,
how the fire increa&s;ed, that theatned his owne, together with
the de&s;truction of the whole action.</P>
<P>But at length, perceiuing that his lenity and fauours did little
good; in that the heat of ambition was not yet allayed, nor
could be quenched, as it &s;eemed, but by blood; and that the
manifold practi&s;es grew dayly more and more, euen to extremi|ties;
he thought it high time, to call the&s;e practi&s;es into que&s;ti|on,
before it were too late, to call any que&s;tion of them into
hearing. And therefore &s;etting good watch ouer him, and a&s;|&s;embling
all his Captaines, and gentlemen of his comapany to|gether;
he propounded to them, the good parts which were in
the gentleman, the great good will, and inward affection, more
then brotherly, which he had euer, &s;ince his fir&s;t acquaintance
borne him, not omitting the re&s;pect, which was had of him,
among no meane per&s;onages in England; and afterwards de|liuered
the letters, which were written to him, with the particu|lars
from time to time, which had beene ob&s;erued, not &s;o much
by him&s;elfe, as by his good friends; not onely at &s;ea, but euen
at Plimmouth; not bare words but writings; not writings a|lone,
but actions, tending to the ouerthrowe of the &s;eruice in
hand, and making away of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Proofes were required and alleaged, &s;o many, and &s;o euident,
that the gentleman him&s;elfe, &s;tricken with remor&s;e of his incon|&s;iderate
and vnkinde dealing, acknowledged him&s;elfe to haue
de&s;erued death, yea many deathes; for that he con&s;pired, not
onely the ouerthrow of the action, but of the principall ac|tor
al&s;o, who was not a &s;tranger or il-willer, but a deare and
true friend vnto him: and therefore in a great a&s;&s;embly open|ly
be&s;ought them, in who&s;e hands iu&s;tice re&s;ted, to take &s;ome
order for him; that he might not be compelled, to enforce his
owne hands, again&s;t his owns bowells, or otherwi&s;e to become
his owne executioner.</P>
<P>The admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment hereat, in all the hearers
euen tho&s;e which were his neere&s;t friends, and mo&s;t affected him
<PB N="31" REF="20">
was great, yea in tho&s;e, which for many benefits receiued from
him, had good cau&s;e to loue him: but yet the generall was
mo&s;t of all di&s;tracted; and therefore withdrewe him&s;elfe, as not
able to conceale his tender affection, requiring them, that had
heard the whole matter, to giue their iudgements, as they would
another day an&s;wer it vnto their prince, and vnto almightie
God, judge of all the earth. Therefore they all, aboue 40. in
number, the chiefe&s;t of place and judgement in the whole fleet,
after they had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed diuer&s;ly of the ca&s;e, and alleaged what|&s;oeuer
came in their mindes, or could be there produced by any
of his other friends, with their owne hands, vnder &s;eale, adiudged
that: <HI>He had de&s;erued death: And that it &s;toode, by no meanes
with their &s;afety, to let him liue: And therefore, they remitted the
manner thereof, with the re&s;t of the circum&s;tances to the generall.</HI></P>
<P>This judgement, and as it were a&s;&s;i&s;e, was held a land, in one
of the Ilands of that port; which afterwards, in memory hereof
was called, the Iland of <HI>True iu&s;tice and iudgement.</HI></P>
<P>Now after this verdict was thus returned vnto our generall
(vnto whom, for his company, her maie&s;tie before his depar|ture,
had committed her &s;word, to v&s;e for his &s;afety, with this
word: <HI>We doe account that he which &s;triketh at thee Drake &s;triketh
at vs</HI>) he called for the guilty party, and cau&s;ed to be read vnto
him, the &s;euerall verdicts which were written, and pronounced
of him, which being acknowledged for the mo&s;t part (for none
had giuen heauier &s;entence again&s;t him, then he had giuen a|gain&s;t
him&s;elfe) our generall propo&s;ed vnto him this choice:
<HI>whether he would take, to be executed in this Iland? or to be &s;ett a|land
on the maine? or returne into England, there to an&s;wer his
deed before the Lords of her maie&s;ties Councell?</HI></P>
<P>He mo&s;t humbly thanked the generall for his clemencie, ex|tended
towards him in &s;uch ample &s;ort: and crauing &s;ome re&s;|pit,
to con&s;ult thereon, and &s;o make his choice adui&s;edly: the
next day he returned this an&s;wer, that: <HI>Albeit he had yeelded in
his heart, to entertaine &s;o great a &s;inne; as whereof now he was iu&s;t|ly
condemned: yet he bad a care, and that excelling all other cares,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="21">
to die a chri&s;tian man, that what&s;oeuer did become of his clay body, he
might yet remaine a&s;&s;ured of an eternall inheritance, in a farre bet|ter
life. This he feared, if he &s;hould be &s;et a land among Infidels, how
he &s;hould be able to maintaine this a&s;&s;urance, feeling in his owne
frailtie, how mighty the contagion is of lewde cu&s;tome. <HI>And there|fore
he be&s;ought the generall mo&s;t earne&s;tly, that</HI> he would yet
haue a care, and regard of his &s;oule; and neuer jeopard it among&s;t
heathen and &s;auage Infidells. If he &s;hould returne into England, he
mu&s;t fir&s;t haue a &s;hip, and men to conduct it, with &s;ufficient victu|als:
two of which though they were had, yet for the third, he
thought no man would accompanie him, in &s;o bad a me&s;&s;age to &s;o vile
an i&s;&s;ue, from &s;o honorable a &s;eruice. But if that there were, which
could induce their mindes, to returne with him; yet the very &s;hame
of the returne, would be as death, or grieuou&s;er if it were po&s;&s;ible: he|cau&s;e
be &s;hould be &s;o long a dying, and die &s;o often. Therefore he pro|fe&s;&s;ed,
that with all his heart, he did embrace the fir&s;t branch of the
generals proffer; de&s;iring onely this fauour, that they might receiue
the holy communion, once againe together before his death; and that
he might not die, other then a gentlemans death.</P>
<P>Though &s;undry rea&s;ons were v&s;ed by many, to per&s;wade him
to take either of the other wayes: yet when he remained re&s;o|lute
in his former determination, both parts of his la&s;t reque&s;t
were granted: and the next conuenient day, a communion was
celebrated, by <HI>Mr. Francis Fletcher,</HI> preacher and pa&s;tor of the
fleet at that time. The generall him&s;elfe communicated in this
Sacred ordinance, with this condemned penitent gentleman;
who &s;hewed great tokens of a contrite and repentant heart, as
who was more deepely di&s;plea&s;ed with his owne act, then any
man el&s;e. And after this holy repa&s;t, they dined al&s;o at the &s;ame
table together, as cheerefully in &s;obriety, as euer in their liues
they had done aforetime: each cheering vp the other, and
taking their leaue, by drinking each to other, as if &s;ome journey
onely had beene in hand.</P>
<P>After dinner, all things being brought in a readines, by him
that &s;upplied the roome of the prouo&s;t Marshall; without any
<PB N="33" REF="21">
dallying, or dolaying the time, he came forth, and kneeled
downe, preparing at once, his necke for the axe, and his &s;pirit
for heauen: which hauing done, without long ceremony, as
who had before dige&s;ted this whole tragedy, he de&s;ired all the
re&s;t to pray for him, and willed the executioner to doe his office,
not to feare nor &s;pare.</P>
<P>Thus hauing by the worthie manner of his, death (being
much more honorable by it, then blameable for any other of his
actions) fully blotted out, what euer &s;taine, his fault might
&s;eeme to bring vpon him; he left vnto our fleete, a lamentable
example of a goodly gentleman, who in &s;eeking aduancement
vnfit for him, ca&s;t away him&s;elfe: and vnto po&s;teritie a monu|ment,
of I know not what, fatall calamitie, incident to that Port,
and &s;uch like actions, which might happilie afford a new paire
of paralells, to be added to Plutarchs: in that the &s;ame place,
neere about the &s;ame time of the yeare, witne&s;&s;ed the execution
of 2. gentlemen, &s;uffring both for the like cau&s;e, employed both
in like &s;eruice, entertained both in great place, endued both
with excellent qualities, the one 58. yeare after the other.</P>
<P>For on the maine, our men found a gibbet, fallen downe,
made of a &s;pruce ma&s;t, with mens bones vnderneath it, which
they coniectured to be the &s;ame gibbet, which Magellane com|manded
to be erected, in the yeare 1520. for the execution, of
<HI>Iohn Carthagene</HI> the Bi&s;hop of Burgos co&s;en, who by the kings
order, was ioyned with Magellane in commi&s;&s;ion, and made his
vice-admirall.</P>
<P>In the Iland, as we digged to burie this gentleman, we found
a great grinding &s;tone, broken in two parts, which wee tooke
and &s;et fa&s;t in the ground, the one part at the head, the other at
the feet, building vp the middle &s;pace, with other &s;tones and
turfes of earth, and engraued in the &s;tones, the names of the par|ties
buried there, with the time of their departure, and a memo|riall
of our generalls name in Latine, that it might the better be
vnder&s;tood, of all that &s;hould come after vs.</P>
<P>The&s;e things thus ended, and &s;et in order, our generall di&s;|charging

keele vpon the Iland: where for two moneths together we had
pitched our tents. And &s;o hauing wooded, watered, trimmed
our &s;hips, di&s;patched all our other bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, and brought our
fleet into the &s;malle&s;t number, euen 3. onely, be&s;ides our pinna|ces,

what &s;oeuer need &s;hould be, Augu&s;t 17. we departed out
of this port, and being now in great hope, of a happie i&s;&s;ue to

<P>Augu&s;t 20. we fel with the cape; neere which lies the en|trance

highe&s;t of the cape, like cape vincent in Portugall: At this cape,
our generall cau&s;ed his fleet, in homage to our &s;oueraigne lady
the Queenes maie&s;ty, to &s;trike their top-&s;ailes vpon the bunt,
as a token of his willing and glad minde, to &s;hewe his dutifull o|bedience
to her highnes, whom he acknowledged to haue full
intere&s;t and right, in that new di&s;couery; and withall, in re|membrance

with prayers and giuing of thankes for her maie&s;ty,
and mo&s;t honorable coun&s;ell, with the whole body of the com|mon
weale, and church of God, we continued our cour&s;e on
into the &s;aid frete, where pa&s;&s;ing with land in fight on both &s;ides,
we &s;hortly fell with &s;o narrow a &s;traite, as carrying with it much
winde, often turnings, and many dangers, requireth an expert
judgement, in him that &s;hall pa&s;&s;e the &s;ame, it lieth We&s;t North

<PB N="35" REF="22">
&s;eemed to be come out of a riuer of two leagues broade, into a
large and maine &s;ea, hauing the night following, an Iland in
&s;ight, which (being in height nothing inferior to the Iland <HI>Fogo,</HI>
before &s;poken of) burneth (like it aloft) al&s;o in the aire, in a won|derfull
&s;ort, without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It hath formerly beene receiued as an vndoubted truth, that
the &s;eas, following the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t mouer, from Ea&s;t to
We&s;t, haue a continuall current through this &s;traite, but our
experience found the contrary: the ebbings and flowings here,
being as orderly (in which the water ri&s;es and falls more then 5.
fathomes, vpright) as on other coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The 24 of Augu&s;t being Bartholomew day, we fell with 3.
Ilands, bearing triangle-wi&s;e one from another, one of them
was very faire and large, and of a fruitfull &s;oile, vpon which be|ing
next vnto vs, and the weather very calme, our generall with
his gentlemen, and certaine of his mariners, then landed; taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof in her Maie&s;ties name, and to her v&s;e, and cal|led
the &s;ame <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Iland.</P>
<P>The other two, though they were not &s;o large, nor &s;o faire to
the eye, yet were they to vs exceeding v&s;efull, for in them wee
found great &s;tore of &s;trange birds, which could not flie at all, nor
yet runne &s;o fa&s;t, as that they could e&s;cape vs with their liues: in
body they are le&s;&s;e then a goo&s;e, and bigger then a mallard,
&s;hort and thicke &s;et together, hauing no feathers, but in&s;teed
thereof, a certaine hard and matted downe; their beakes are not
much vnlike the bills of crowes, they lodge and breed vpon the
land, where making earthes, as the conies doe, in the ground,
they lay their egges, and bring vp their young; their feeding
and proui&s;ion to liue on, is in the &s;ea, where they &s;wimm in &s;uch
&s;ort, as nature may &s;eeme to haue granted them no &s;mall prero|gatiue
in &s;wiftne&s;&s;e, both to prey vpon others, and them&s;elues to
e&s;cape from any others that &s;eeke to cea&s;e vpon them, and &s;uch
was the infinite re&s;ort of the&s;e birds to the&s;e Ilands, that in the
&s;pace of 1. day, we killed no le&s;&s;e then 3000. &amp; if the increa&s;e be
according to the number, it is not to be thought, that the world
<PB N="36" REF="23">
hath brought forth, a greater ble&s;&s;ing in one kinde of creature
in &s;o &s;mall a circuit, &s;o nece&s;&s;arily and plentifully &s;eruing the v&s;e
of man, they are a very good and whole&s;ome victuall: our ge|nerall
named the&s;e Ilands, the one <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> according to
the day; the other Saint <HI>Georges,</HI> in honour of England, accor|ding
to the ancient cu&s;tome there ob&s;erued.</P>
<P>In the Iland of Saint <HI>George,</HI> we found the body of a man, &s;o
long dead before, that his bones would not hold together, be|ing
moued out of the place whereon they lay.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Ilands, to the entrance into the South &s;ea, the
frete is very crooked; hauing many turnings, and as it were &s;hut|tings
vp, as if there were no pa&s;&s;age at all, by meanes whereof, we
were often troubled with contrary windes, &s;o that &s;ome of our
&s;hips, recouering a cape of land, entring another reach, the re&s;t
were forced to alter their cour&s;e, and come to anchor where
they might. It is true which Magellane reporteth of this pa&s;|&s;age:
namely that there be many faire harbours, and &s;tore of
fre&s;h water; but &s;ome &s;hips, had need to be fraughted with no|thing
el&s;e, be&s;ides anchors and cables, to finde ground, in mo&s;t
of them, to come to anchor; which when any extreame gu&s;ts,
or contrary windes doe come (whereunto the place is altoge|ther
&s;ubiect) is a great hindrance to the pa&s;&s;age and carrieth
with it no &s;mall danger.</P>
<P>The land on both &s;ides is very high and mountainous, ha|uing
on the North and We&s;t &s;ide the continent of America,

hauing brought his fleete to anchor vnder an Iland; him&s;elfe,

<P>This cannowe or boate was made of the barke of diuers
trees, hauing a prowe and a &s;terne &s;tanding vp, and &s;emicircle|wi&s;e

the cunning and expert iudgement of art; and that not for the
v&s;e of &s;o rude and barborous a people, but for the plea&s;ure of
&s;ome great and noble per&s;onage, yea of &s;ome Prince: It had no
other clo&s;ing vp or caulking in the &s;eames, but the &s;titchin with

<P>The people are of a meane &s;tature, but well &s;et and compact,

being of a very formall &s;hape and good fa&s;hion. Their working

<P>From this bay of parting of friends, we were forcibly driuen

which height we ranne in among the Ilands before mentioned,
lying to the Southward of America, through which we pa&s;&s;ed
from one &s;ea to the other, as hath beene declared. Where com|ming
to anchor, wee found the waters there to haue their in|draught

before were weake, and much empaired in their health, began to
receiue good comfort: e&s;pecially by the drinking of one herbe
(not much vnlike that herbe which wee commonly call Penny|lea&s;e)
which purging with great facilitie affoorded great helpe
and refre&s;hing to our wearied and &s;ickly bodies. But the winds
returning to their old wont, and the &s;eas raging after their for|mer

<P><PB N="42" REF="26">
For &s;uch was the pre&s;ent danger by forcing and continuall
&s;lawes, that we were rather to looke for pre&s;ent death then hope
for any deliuery, if God almightie &s;hould not make the way for
vs. The winds were &s;uch as if the bowels of the earth had &s;et all
at libertie; or as if all the clouds vnder heauen had beene called
together, to lay their force vpon that one place: The &s;eas, which
by nature and of them&s;elues are heauie, and of a weightie &s;ub|&s;tance,
were rowled vp from the depths, euen from the roots of
the rockes, as if it had beene a &s;croll of parchment, which by the
extremity of heate runneth together: and being aloft were car|ried
in mo&s;t &s;trange manner and abundance, as feathers or drifts
of &s;now, by the violence of the winds, to water the exceeding
tops of high and loftie mountaines. Our anchors, as fal&s;e friends
in &s;uch a danger, gaue ouer their holdfa&s;t, and as if it had beene
with horror of the thing, did &s;hrinke downe to hide them&s;elues
in this mi&s;erable &s;torme; committing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;hip and
helpele&s;&s;e men to the vncertaine and rowling &s;eas, which to&s;&s;ed
them, like a ball in a racket. In this ca&s;e, to let fall more anchors,
would auaile vs nothing; For being driuen from our fir&s;t place
of anchoring, &s;o vnmea&s;urable was the depth, that 500. fathome
would fetch no ground: So that the violent &s;torme without in|termi&s;&s;ion;
the impo&s;&s;ibility to come to anchor; the want of op|portunitie
to &s;pread any &s;ayle, the mo&s;t mad &s;eas; the lee &s;hores;
the dangerous rocks; the contrary and mo&s;t intollerable winds;

likely that the mountaines &s;hould haue beene rent in &s;under,
from the top to the bottome, and ca&s;t headlong into the &s;ea, by

<P>Not many leagues therefore to the Southwards of our for|mer

<P>Thence (hauing furni&s;hed our &s;elues to our content) we con|tinued
our cour&s;e Nouember 1. &s;till Northwe&s;t, as wee had
formerly done, but in going on, we &s;oone e&s;pied, that we might
ea&s;ily haue beene deceiued: and therefore ca&s;ting about,
and &s;teering vpon another point, wee found, that the generall
mappes did erre from the truth, in &s;etting downe the coa&s;t of <HI>Pe|ru,</HI>
for 12. deg. at lea&s;t to the Northward, of the &s;uppo&s;ed
&s;traite; no le&s;&s;e then is the Northwe&s;t point of the compa&s;&s;e,
different from the Northea&s;t, perceiuing hereby, that no man,
had euer by trauell, di&s;couered any part of the&s;e 12. deg. and
therefore the &s;etters forth of &s;uch de&s;criptions, are not to be
tru&s;ted; much le&s;&s;e honored, in their fal&s;e and fraudulent con|iectures;
which they v&s;e, not in this alone, but in diuers other
points of no &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>We found this part of <HI>Peru,</HI> all along&s;t to the height of <HI>Lima,</HI>
which is 12. deg. South of the line, to be mountainous and ve|ry
barren, without water or wood, for the mo&s;t part, except in
certaine places, inhabited by the Spaniards, and few others,
which are very fruitfull and commodious.</P>
<P>After we were once againe thus fallen with the land, we conti|nually
coa&s;ted along, til we came to the height of 37. d. or there|about:
and finding no conuenient place of abode, nor likeli|hood
to heare any newes of our &s;hips, we ranne off againe with
an Iland, which lay in &s;ight, named of the Spaniards <HI>Mucho,</HI> by
<PB N="47" REF="28">
rea&s;on of the greatne&s;&s;e and large circuit thereof.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="Nou."> At this Iland comming to anchor, Nouemb. 25. we found it
to be a fruitfull place, and well &s;tored with &s;undrie &s;orts of good
things: as &s;heepe and other cattell, maize, which is a kinde of
graine whereof they make bread, potatoes, with &s;uch other
rootes: be&s;ides that, it is thought to be wonderfull rich in gold
and to want no good thing for the v&s;e of mans life. The inhabi|tants
are &s;uch Indians, as by the cruell and mo&s;t extreame dea|ling
of the Spaniards, haue beene driuen to flie from the maine,
here to releeue and fortifie them&s;elues. With this people, our
Generall thought it meet to haue traffique, for fre&s;h victuals and
water: and for that cau&s;e, the very &s;ame night of our arriuall
there, him&s;elfe with diuers of his company went a&s;hoare, to
whom the people with great courte&s;ie came downe, bringing
with them &s;uch fruits and other victuals as they had, and two
very fat &s;heepe, which they gaue our Generall for a pre&s;ent. In
recompence whereof, hee be&s;towed vpon them againe many
good and nece&s;&s;arie things; &s;ignifying vnto them, that the end
of his comming was for no other cau&s;e but by way of exchange,
to traffique with them for &s;uch things as wee needed, and they
could &s;pare: and in particular, for &s;uch as they had alreadie
brought downe vnto vs, be&s;ides fre&s;h water, which wee de&s;ired
of them. Herein they held them&s;elues well contented, and &s;ee|med
to be not a little ioyful of our comming: appointing where
we &s;hould the next morning haue fre&s;h water at plea&s;ure, and
withall &s;ignifying that then al&s;o they would bring vs downe &s;uch
other things as we de&s;ired to &s;erue our turnes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="Nou."> The next day therefore very early in the morning (all things
being made readie for traffique, as al&s;o ve&s;&s;els prepared to bring
the water) our Generall taking great care for &s;o nece&s;&s;arie pro|ui&s;ion,
repaired to the &s;hoare againe; and &s;etting aland two of
his men, &s;ent them with their <HI>Barricoes</HI> to the watering place, a&s;|&s;igned
the night before. Who hauing peaceably pa&s;t on one
halfe of the way, were then with no &s;mall violence &s;et vpon by
tho&s;e traiterous people, and &s;uddenly &s;laine: And to the end that
<PB N="48" REF="29">
our Generall with the re&s;t of his company &s;hould not onely be
&s;tayed from re&s;cuing them, but al&s;o might fall (if it were po&s;&s;i|ble)
into their hands in like manner, they had layed clo&s;ely be|hind
the rockes an ambu&s;hment of (as we gue&s;&s;ed) about 500.
men, armed and well appointed for &s;uch a mi&s;chiefe. Who &s;ud|denly
attempting their purpo&s;e (the rocks being very dangerous
for the boate, and the &s;ea-gate exceeding great) by &s;hooting
their arrowes hurt and wounded euery one of our men, before
they could free them&s;elues, or come to die v&s;e of there weapons
to do any good. The General him&s;elf was &s;hot in the face, vnder
his right eye, and clo&s;e by his no&s;e, the arrow piercing a maruel|lous
way in, vnder <HI>ba&s;is cerebri,</HI> with no &s;mall danger of his life;
be&s;ides that, he was grieuou&s;ly wounded in the head. The re&s;t,
being nine per&s;ons in the boate, were deadly wounded in diuers
parts of their bodies, if God almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly had not giuen
cure to the &s;ame. For our chiefe Surgeon being dead, and the
other ab&s;ent by the lo&s;&s;e of our vice-admirall, and hauing none
left vs but a boy, who&s;e good will was more then any skill hee
had, we were little better then altogether de&s;titute of &s;uch cun|ning
and helpes as &s;o grieuous a &s;tate of &s;o many wounded bo|dies
did require. Notwith&s;tanding God, by the good aduice of
our Generall, and the diligent putting too of euery mans helpe,
did giue &s;uch &s;peedy and wonderfull cure, that we had all great
comfort thereby, and yeelded God the glory thereof.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this force and iniurie by the&s;e Ilanders, was no
other but the deadly hatred which they beare again&s;t their cruell
enemies the Spaniards, for the bloudy and mo&s;t tirannous op|pre&s;&s;ion
which they had v&s;ed towards them. And therefore with
purpo&s;e again&s;t them (&s;u&s;pecting vs to bee Spaniards indeed,
and that the rather, by occa&s;ion that though command was gi|uen
to the contrary, &s;ome of our men in demanding water, v&s;ed
the Spani&s;h word <HI>Aqua</HI>)&s;ought &s;ome part of reuenge again&s;t vs.</P>
<P>Our Generall notwith&s;tanding he might haue reuenged this
wrong; with little hazard or danger; yet being more de&s;irous to
pre&s;erue one of his owne men aliue, then to de&s;troy 100. of his
<PB N="49" REF="29">
enemies, committed the &s;ame to God: wi&s;hing this onely pu|ni&s;hment
to them, that they did but know whom they had
wronged, and that they had done this iniurie not to an enemie,
but to a friend, not to a Spaniard, but to an Engli&s;hman; who
would rather haue beene a patron to defend them, then any
way an in&s;trument of the lea&s;t wrong that &s;hould haue beene
done vnto them. The weapons which this people v&s;e in their
warres, are arrowes of reeds, with heads of &s;tone, very brittle and
indented&punc; but darts of a great length, headed with iron or bone.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day that we receiued this dangerous affront, in the
afternoone we &s;et &s;ayle from thence; and becau&s;e we were now
nigh the appointed height, wherein our &s;hips were to be looked
for, as al&s;o the extremity and cra&s;ie &s;tate of our hurt men adui|&s;ing
vs to v&s;e expedition, to finde &s;one conuenient place of re|po&s;e,
which might afford them &s;ome re&s;t, and yeeld vs nece&s;&s;ary
&s;upply of fre&s;h victuals for their diet; we bent our cour&s;e, as the
wind would &s;uffer vs, directly to run in with the maine. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="Nou."> Where
falling with a bay, called <HI>Philips Bay,</HI> in, 32. deg. or thereabout,
Nouemb. 30. we came to anchor: and foorthwith manned and

to affoord vs &s;uch things as we &s;tood in need of.</P>
<P>Our boate doing her vttermo&s;t endeuour in a diligent &s;earch,
yet after long trauell could find no appearance of hope for re|liefe,
either of fre&s;h victuals or of fre&s;h water: huge heards of
wild buffes they might di&s;ecrne, but not &s;o much as any &s;igne of
any inhabitant thereabout. Yet in their returne to vs, they de&s;|cried
within the bay, an Indian with his Canow as he was a fi&s;h|ing:
him they brought aboard our generall, canow and all as he
was in it. A comely per&s;onage, and of a goodly &s;tature; his appa|rell
was a white garment, reaching &s;carcely to his knees, his
armes and legges were naked; his haire vpon his head verie long;
without a beard, as all the Indians for the mo&s;t part are. He &s;ee|med
verie gentle, of mild and humble nature, being verie tracta|ble
to learne the v&s;e of euery thing, and mo&s;t gratefull for &s;uch
things as our Generall be&s;towed vpon him. In him we might &s;ee
<PB N="50" REF="30">
a mo&s;t liuely patterne of the harmele&s;&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of that peo|ple;
and how grieuous a thing it is that they &s;hould by any
meanes be &s;o abu&s;ed as all tho&s;e are, whom the Spaniards haue
any command or power ouer.</P>
<P>This man being courteou&s;ly entertained, and his paines of
comming double required; after we had &s;hewed him, partly by
&s;ignes, and partly by &s;uch things as we had, what things we nee|ded,
and would gladly receiue by his meanes, vpon exchange
of &s;uch things as he would de&s;ire; wee &s;ent him away with our
boate and his owne canow (which was made of reed &s;traw) to
land him where he would. Who being landed, and willing our
men to &s;tay his returne, was immediatly met with by two or three
of his friends; to whom imparting his newes, and &s;hewing what
gifts he had receiued, he gaue &s;o great content, that they wil|lingly
furthered his purpo&s;e; &s;o that, after certaine houres of our
mens abode there, hee with diuers others (among whom was
their head or Captaine) made their returne; bringing with them
their loadings of &s;uch things as they thought would do vs good:
as &s;ome hennes, egges, a fat hogge, and &s;uch like. All which
(that our men might be without all &s;u&s;pition of all euill to be
meant or intended by them) they &s;ent in one of their canowes,
a rea&s;onable di&s;tance from off the &s;hoare, to our boate, the &s;ea-gate
being at that pre&s;ent very great, and their Captaine hauing
&s;ent backe his hor&s;e, would needs commit him&s;elfe to the credit
of our men, though &s;trangers, and come with them to our Ge|nerall,
without any of his owne acquaintance or countriemen
with him.</P>
<P>By his comming as we vnder&s;tood, that there was no meane
or way, to haue our nece&s;&s;ities relieued in this place; &s;o he offe|red
him&s;elfe to be our pilote, to a place and that a good harbo|rough,
not farre backe to the Southward againe: where, by
way of traffique, we might haue at plea&s;ure, both water, and
tho&s;e other things which we &s;tood in need of. This offer our ge|nerall
very gladly receiued, and &s;o much the rather, for that the
place intended, was neere about the place appointed, for the
<PB N="51" REF="30">
randenoues of our fleete. Omitting therefore our purpo&s;e, of
pur&s;uing the buffes formerly &s;poken of, of which we had other|wi&s;e
determined, if po&s;&s;ible to haue killed &s;ome; this good
newes of better proui&s;ion, and more ea&s;ie to come by, drew vs
away: and &s;o the 5. day after our arriuall, viz. <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="Decem."> December 4. we
departed hence, and the next day <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="Decemb."> December 5. by the willing
conduct of our new Indian Pilote, we came to anchor in the de|&s;ired
harbor.</P>
<P>This harbor the Spaniards call <HI>valperizo,</HI> and the towne ad|ioyning
<HI>Saint Iames</HI> of <HI>Chinli</HI> it &s;tands in 35. deg. 40. min.
where albeit we neither met with our &s;hips, not heard of them,
yet there was no good thing which the place afforded, or which
our nece&s;&s;ities indeed for the pre&s;ent required, but we had the
&s;ame in great abundance: among&s;t other things we found in
the towne diuer&s;e &s;torehou&s;es of the wines of <HI>Chilie;</HI> and in
the harbour, a &s;hip called the <HI>Captaine of Moriall, or the grand
Captaine of the South, Admirall to the Ilands of Salomon;</HI> loaden
for the mo&s;t part, with the &s;ame kinde of liquors: onely there
was be&s;ides, a certaine quantity of fine gold of Baldiuia and a
great cro&s;&s;e of gold be&s;et with Emeranlds, on which was nailed
a God of the &s;ame mettall, wee &s;pent &s;ome time in refre&s;hing
our &s;elues, and ea&s;ing this &s;hip of &s;o heauy a burthen: and on
the 8. day of the &s;ame moneth (hauing in the meane time, &s;uffi|ciently
&s;tored our &s;elues with nece&s;&s;aries, as wine, bread, bacon
&amp;c. for along &s;ea&s;on) we &s;et &s;aile, returning backe towards the
line; carrying againe our Indian pilote with vs, whom our ge|nerall
bountifully rewarded, and enriched with many good
things, which plea&s;ed him exceedingly, and cau&s;ed him, by the
way, to be landed in the place where he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Our nece&s;&s;ities being thus to our content releeued, our next
care was the regaining (if po&s;&s;ible) of the company of our &s;hips,
&s;o long &s;euered from vs: neither would any thing haue &s;atisfied
bur generall, or vs &s;o well, as the happy meeting, or good newes
of them, this way therefore (all other thoughts for the pre&s;ent
&s;et apart) were all our &s;tudies and endeauours bent, how to fit it
<PB N="52" REF="31">
&s;o, as that no opportunity of meeting them might be pa&s;&s;ed
ouer.</P>
<P>To this end, con&s;idering that we could not conueniently
runne in with our &s;hip (in &s;earch of them) to euery place, where
was likelihood of being a harbour; and that our boate was too
little, and vnable to carry men enough, to encounter the ma|lice
or treachery of the Spaniards (if we &s;hould by any chance
meete with any of them) who are v&s;ed to &s;hew no mercy, where
they may ouerma&s;ter; and therefore meaning not to hazard
our &s;elues to their cruell courte&s;ie; we determined, as we coa|&s;ted
now towards the line, to &s;earch diligently for &s;ome conue|nient
place, where we might, in peace and &s;afety, &s;tay the trim|ming
of our &s;hip, and the erecting of a pinnace, in which wee
might with better &s;ecurity, then in our boate, and without en|dangering
of our &s;hip, by running into each creeke, leaue no
place vntried, if happily we might &s;o finde againe our friends
and countrimen.</P>
<P>For this cau&s;e December 19.<MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="Dec."> we entred a bay, not farre to
the Southward of the towne of Cyppo now inhabited by the
Spaniards, in 29. deg 30. min. where hauing landed certaine of
our men, to the number of 14. to &s;earch what conueniency
the place was likely to afford, for our abiding there; we were
immediatly de&s;cried by the Spaniards, of the towne of Cyppo,
afore&s;ayd, who &s;peedily made out 300. men at lea&s;t wherof 100.
were Spaniards, euery one well mounted vpon his hor&s;e; the
re&s;t were Indians, running as dogs, at their heeles, all naked,
and in mo&s;t mi&s;erable bondage.</P>
<P>They could not come any way &s;o clo&s;ely, but God did open
our eyes to &s;ee them, before there was any extremity of danger,
whereby our men being warned, had rea&s;onable time to &s;hift
them&s;elues as they could; fir&s;t from the maine, to a rocke with|in
the &s;ea; and from thence into their boate: which being ready
to receiue them, conueighed them with expedition, out of the
reach of the Spaniards fury, without the hurt of any man.</P>
<P>Onely one <HI>Richard Miniuy,</HI> being ouer bold and carele&s;&s;e of
<PB N="53" REF="31">
his owne &s;afety, would not be intreated by his friends, nor fea|red
by the multitude of his enemies, to take the pre&s;ent benefit
of his owne deliuery: but cho&s;e either to make 300. me~ by out|brauing
of them to become afraide, or el&s;e him&s;elfe to die in
the place; the latter of which indeed he did, who&s;e dead body
being drawne by the Indians from the rocke to the &s;hoare, was
there manfully by the Spaniards beheaded, the right hand cut
off, the heart pluct out, all which they carried away in our &s;ight,
and for the re&s;t of his carca&s;e, they cau&s;ed the Indians to
&s;hoote it full of arrowes, made but the &s;ame day, of greene
wood, and &s;o left it to be deuoured of the bea&s;tes and foules
but that we went a&s;hoare againe and buried it: wherein as
there appeareth a mo&s;t extreame and barbarous cruelty, &s;o doth
it declare to the world, in what mi&s;erable feare the Spaniard
holdeth the gouernment of tho&s;e parts; liuing in continuall
dread of forreigne inua&s;ion by &s;trangers, or &s;ecret cutting of their
throats, by tho&s;e whom they kept vnder them in &s;o &s;hamefull
&s;lauery, I meane the innocent and harmele&s;&s;e Indians. And
therefore they make &s;ure to murther what &s;trangers &s;oeuer they
can come by, and &s;uffer the Indians by no meanes to haue any
weapon longer then they be in pre&s;ent &s;eruice: as appeared by
their arrowes cut from the tree the &s;ame day, as al&s;o by the
credible report of others who knew the matter to be true. Yea
they &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hew the wretches great fauour, when they
do not for their plea&s;ures whip them with cords, and day by day
drop their naked bodies with burning bacon: which is one of
the lea&s;t cruelties, among&s;t many, which they vniuer&s;ally v&s;e
again&s;t that Nation and people.</P>
<P>This being not the place we looked for, nor the entertaine|ment
&s;uch as we de&s;ired; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="Dec."> we &s;peedily got hence againe, and De|cemb.

in 27. deg. 55. win. South the line.</P>
<P>In this place we &s;pent &s;ome time in trimming of our &s;hip, and
building of our pinnace, as we de&s;ired: but &s;till the griefe for the

ab&s;ence of our friends remained with vs, for the finding of
whom, our generall hauing now fitted all things to his mind, in|tended
(leauing his &s;hip the meane while at anchor in the bay)
with his pinnace and &s;ome cho&s;en men, him&s;elfe to returne
backe to the Southwards againe; to &s;ee if happily he might ei|ther
him&s;elfe meete with them, or find them in &s;ome harbour, or
creeke; or heare of them by any others, whom he might meete
with, with this re&s;olution he &s;et on, but after one daies &s;ayling,
the winde being contrary to his purpo&s;e, he was forced, whether
he would or no to returne againe.</P>
<P>within this bay, during our abode there, we had &s;uch abun|dance
of fi&s;h, not much vnlike our Gurnard in England, as no

the coa&s;t of Barbary excepted) &s;ince our fir&s;t &s;etting forth of
Plymmouth, vntill this time, the plenty whereof in this place
was &s;uch, that our gentlemen &s;porting them&s;elues day by day,
with 4. or 5. hookes and lines, in 2. or 3. houres, would take
&s;ometimes 400. &s;ometimes more at one time.</P>

22. was an Iland &s;tanding in the &s;ame height, with the North
cape of the prouince of Mormorena, at this Iland we found 4.
Indians with their canowes, which tooke vpon them to bring
our men to a place of fre&s;h water, on the fore&s;ayd cape; in hope
whereof, our generall made them great cheere (as his manner
was towards all &s;trangers) and &s;et his cour&s;e by their direction,
but when we came vnto the place, and had trauelled vp a long
way into the land, wee found fre&s;h water indeed, but &s;carce &s;o
much as they had drunke wine in their pa&s;&s;age thither.</P>
<P>As we &s;ayled along, continually &s;earching for fre&s;h water;
we came to a place called Tarapaca, and landing there we ligh|ted
on a Spaniard who lay a&s;leepe, and had lying by him 13.
barres of &s;iluer, waighing in all, about 4000. Spani&s;h duccatts:
we would not (could wee haue cho&s;en) haue awaked him of his
nappe: but &s;eeing we, again&s;t our wills, did him that iniury, we
<PB N="55" REF="32">
freed him of his charge, which otherwi&s;e perhaps would haue
kept him waking, and &s;o left him to take out (if it plea&s;ed him)
the other part of his &s;leepe, in more &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Our &s;earch for water &s;till continuing, as we landed againe
not farre from thence, we met a Spaniard with an Indian boy,
driuing 8. Lambes or Peruvian &s;heepe: each &s;heepe bare two
leathren bagges, and in each bagge was 50. pound waight of
refined &s;iluer, in the whole 800. waight: we could not indure
to &s;ee a gentleman Spaniard turnd carrier &s;o; and therefore
without intreaty, we offered our &s;eruice, and became drouers:
onely his directions were not &s;o perfect, that we could keepe the
way which hee intended; for almo&s;t as &s;oone as hee was parted
from vs, we with our new kinde of carriges, were come vnto
our boates.</P>
<P>Farther beyond this cape fore-mentioned lie certaine Indian
towns, fro~ whence as we pa&s;&s;ed by, came many of the people in

floateth, and is rowed very &s;wiftly, carrying in it no &s;mall bur|then.
In the&s;e vpon &s;ight of our &s;hip, they brought &s;tore of fi&s;h

<P>Not farre from this, viz. in 22. deg. 30. min. lay Mormorena,
another great towne of the &s;ame people, ouer whom 2. Spani|ards
held the gouerment, with the&s;e our generall thought meet
to deale; or at lea&s;t to try their courte&s;y, whether they would, in
way of traffique, giue vs &s;uch things as we needed or no, and
therefore <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="Ian."> Ian. the 26. we ca&s;t anchor here, we found them (more
<PB N="56" REF="33">
for feare then for loue) &s;omewhat tractable, and receiued from
them by exchange many good things, very nece&s;&s;arie for our
v&s;es.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other things which we had of them, the &s;heepe of
the countrey (viz. &s;uch as we mentioned before bearing the lea|therne
bags) were mo&s;t memorable. Their height and length
was equall to a pretty cow, and their &s;trength fully an&s;werable,
if not by much exceeding their &s;ize or &s;tature. Vpon one of their
backes did &s;it at one time three well growne and tall men, and
one boy, no mans foot touching the ground by a large foot in
length, the bea&s;t nothing at all complaining of his burthen in
the meane time. The&s;e &s;heepe haue neckes like camels; their
heads bearing a rea&s;onable re&s;emblance of another &s;heepe. The
Spaniards v&s;e them to great profit. Their wooll is exceeding
fine, their fle&s;h good meate, their increa&s;e ordinarie, and be|&s;ides
they &s;upply the roome of hor&s;es for burthen or trauell: yea
they &s;erue to carry, ouer the mountaines, maruellous loades, for
300. leagues together, where no other carriage can be made but
by them onely. Hereabout, as al&s;o all along, and vp into the
countrey throughout the Prouince of Cusko, the common
ground where&s;oeuer it bee taken vp, in euery hundred pound
weight of earth, yeeldeth 25. s. of pure &s;iluer, after the rate of a
crowne an ounce.</P>
<P>The next place likely to affoord vs any newes of our &s;hips
(for in all this way from the height where wee builded our pin|nace,
there was no bay or harbour at all for &s;hipping) was the
port of the towne of Arica, &s;tanding in 20. deg. whither we arri|ued
the 7. of February <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="Feb.">: This towne &s;eemed to vs to &s;tand in the
mo&s;t fruitfull &s;oile that we &s;aw all along&s;t the&s;e coa&s;ts: both for
that it is &s;ituate in the mouth of a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile vally,
abounding with all good things; as al&s;o in that it hath continu|all
trade of &s;hipping, as well from Lyma as from all other parts
of Peru. It is inhabited by the Spaniards. In two barks here, we
found &s;ome forty and odde barres of &s;iluer (of the bigne&s;&s;e and
fa&s;hion of a brickbatte, and in waight each of them about 20.
<PB N="57" REF="33">
pounds) of which wee tooke the burthen on our &s;elues to ea&s;e
them, and &s;o departed towards Chowley; with which wee fell
the &s;econd day following,<MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="Feb."> viz. Febr. 9. and in our way to <HI>Lima,</HI>
we met with another barke at <HI>Ariquipa,</HI> which had begun to
loade &s;ome &s;iluer and gold, but hauing had (as it &s;eemed from
Arica by land) &s;ome notice of our coming, had vnloaden the
&s;ame againe before our arriuall. Yet in this our pa&s;&s;age we met
another barke loaden with linnen: &s;ome of which we thought
might &s;tand vs in &s;ome &s;tead, and therefore tooke it with vs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="Feb."> At Lima we arriued Febr. 15. and notwith&s;tanding the Spa|niards
forces, though they had thirtie &s;hips at that pre&s;ent in

all the South &s;ea) were fully ready, we entred and anchored all
night in the midde&s;t of them, in the Calao: and might haue
made more &s;poile among&s;t them in few houres if we had beene
affected to reuenge, then the Spaniard could haue recouered
againe in many yeares. But wee had more care to get vp that
company which we had &s;o long mi&s;t, then to recompence their
cruell and hard dealing by an euen requitall, which now wee

<P>Here albeit no good newes of our &s;hips could bee had, yet
got we the newes of &s;ome things that &s;eemed to comfort, if not
to counteruaile our trauells thither, as namely, that in the &s;hip
of one <HI>Mighell Angell</HI> there, there were 1500. barres of plate,
be&s;ides &s;ome other things (as &s;ilkes, linnen, and in one a che&s;t
full of royals of plate) which might &s;tand vs in &s;ome &s;tead in the
other &s;hips; aboard whom we made &s;omewhat bold to bid our &s;elues
welcome. Here al&s;o we heard the report of &s;ome things
that had befallen in &amp; neere Europe, &s;ince our departure thence;
In particular of the death of &s;ome great per&s;onages: as, the king
of Portugall, and both the kings of Morocco and Fe&s;&s;e, dead all
three in one day at one battell: The death of the king of France,
and the Pope of Rome: Who&s;e abhominations as they are in

any where, &s;o do the manners that nece&s;&s;arily accompanie the
&s;ame infinuate them&s;elues together with the doctrine. For as its
true that in all the parts of America, where the Spaniards haue
any gouernment, the poi&s;onous infection of Popery hath &s;pread
it &s;elfe; &s;o on the other &s;ide it is as true, that there is no Citie, as
Lima, Panama, Mexico, &amp;c. no towne or village, yea no hou&s;e

Spani&s;h vertues) not onely whoredome, but the filthine&s;&s;e of
Sodome, not to bee named among Chri&s;tians, is not common
without reproofe: the Popes pardons being more rife in the&s;e
parts then they be in any part of Europe, for the&s;e filthine&s;&s;es
whereout he &s;ucketh no &s;mall aduantage. Notwith&s;tanding the
Indians, who are nothing neerer the true knowledge of God
then they were afore, abhorre this mo&s;t filthie and loath&s;ome

barbarous ignorance, yet in life and behauiour, did &s;o farre ex|cell
the wi&s;e and learned Greekes, as they were &s;hort of them in

<P>But as the Pope and Antichri&s;tian Bi&s;hops labour by their
wicked factors with tooth and naile to deface the glory of God,

who had often him&s;elfe proued the force of the burning Zone;
who&s;e aduice alwayes preuailed much to the pre&s;eruing of a
moderate temper in our con&s;titutions: &s;o that euen after our
departure from the heate wee alwayes found our bodies not as
&s;ponges, but &s;trong and hardned, more able to beare out cold,
though we came out of exce&s;&s;e of heate, then a number of cham|ber
champions could haue beene, who lye on their feather-beds
till they go to &s;ea, or rather who&s;e teeth in a temperate aire do
beate in their heads, at a cup of cold Sack and &s;ugar by the fire.</P>
<P>And that it was not our tendernes, but the very extremitie of
the cold it &s;elfe, that cau&s;ed this &s;en&s;iblenes in vs, may the rather
appeare in that the naturall inhabitants of the place (with whom
we had for a long &s;ea&s;on familiar intercour&s;e, as is to be related)
who had neuer beene acquainted with &s;uch heate; to whom the
countrey, ayre, and climate was proper; and in whom cu&s;tome
of cold was as it were a &s;econd nature: yet v&s;ed to come &s;hiue|ring
to vs in their warme furres; crowding clo&s;e together body
to body, to receiue heate one of another, and &s;heltring them|&s;elues
vnder a lee bancke, if it were po&s;&s;ible, and as often as they
could, labouring to &s;hroude them&s;elues vnder our garments al|&s;o,
to keepe them warme. Be&s;ides how vnhand&s;ome and defor|med
appeared the face of the earth it &s;elfe &s;hewing trees with|out
leaues, and the ground without greennes in tho&s;e moneths
of Iune and Iuly. The poore birds and foules not daring (as we
had great experience to ob&s;erue it) not daring &s;o much as once
to ari&s;e from their ne&s;ts, after the fir&s;t egge layed, till it with all
the re&s;t be hatched, and brought to &s;ome &s;trength of nature, able
to helpe it &s;elfe. Onely this recompence hath nature affoorded
<PB N="66" REF="38">
them, that the heate of their owne bodies being exceeding great,
it perfecteth the creature with greater expedition, and in &s;horter
time then is to be found in many other places.</P>
<P>As for the cau&s;es of this extremity they &s;eeme not to be &s;o
deeply hidden, but that they may at lea&s;t in part be gue&s;&s;ed at:
The chiefe&s;t of which we conceiue to be the large &s;preading of
the A&s;ian and American continent, which (&s;omewhat North|ward
of the&s;e parts) if they be not fully ioyned, yet &s;eeme they
to come very neere one to the other. From who&s;e high and
&s;now-couered mountaines, the North and North-we&s;t winds
(the con&s;tant vi&s;itants of tho&s;e coa&s;ts) &s;end abroad their frozen
nimphes, to the infecting of the whole aire with this in&s;uffera|ble
&s;harpne&s;&s;e: not permitting the Sunne, no not in the pride
of his heate, to di&s;&s;olue that congealed matter and &s;now, which
they haue breathed out &s;o nigh the Sunne, and &s;o many degrees
di&s;tant from them&s;elues. And that the North and North-we&s;t
winds are here con&s;tant in Iune and Iuly, as the North wind a|lone
is in Augu&s;t and September; we not onely found it by our
owne experience, but were fully confirmed in the opinion there|of,
by the continued ob&s;eruations of the Spaniards. Hence
comes the generall &s;qualidne&s;&s;e and barrenne&s;&s;e of the countrie;
hence comes it, that in the midde&s;t of their Summer, the &s;now
hardly departeth euen from their very doores, but is neuer ta|ken
away from their hils at all; hence come tho&s;e thicke mi&s;ts
and mo&s;t &s;tinking fogges, which increa&s;e &s;o much the more, by
how much higher the pole is rai&s;ed: wherein a blind pilot is as
good as the be&s;t director of a cour&s;e. For the Sunne &s;triuing to
performe his naturall office, in eleuating the vapours out of the&s;e
inferior bodies; draweth nece&s;&s;arily abundance of moi&s;ture out
of the &s;ea: bat the nipping cold (from the former cau&s;es) mee|ting
and oppo&s;ing the Sunnes indeuour, forces him to giue ouer
his worke imperfect: and in&s;tead of higher eleuation, to leaue in
the lowe&s;t region, wandring vpon the face of the earth and wa|ters,
as it were a &s;econd &s;ea: through which its owne beames can|not
po&s;&s;ibly pierce, vnle&s;&s;e &s;ometimes when the &s;udden violence
<PB N="67" REF="38">
of the winds doth helpe to &s;catter and breake through it; which
thing happeneth very &s;eldome, and when it happeneth is of no
continuance. Some of our marriners in this voyage had former|ly
beene at Wardhou&s;e, in 72. deg. of North latitude; who yet
affirmed, that they felt no &s;uch nipping cold there in the end of
Summer, when they departed thence, as they did here in tho&s;e
hotte&s;t moneths of Iune and Iuly.</P>
<P>And al&s;o from the&s;e rea&s;ons we coniecture; that either there
is no pa&s;&s;age at all through the&s;e Northerne coa&s;ts (which is
mo&s;t likely) or if there be, that yet it is vnnauigable. Adde here|unto,
that though we &s;earched the coa&s;t diligently, euen vnto
the 48. deg. yet found we not the land, to trend &s;o much as one
point in any place towards the Ea&s;t, but rather running on con|tinually
Northwe&s;t, as if it went directly to meet with A&s;ia; and
euen in that height when we had a franke wind, to haue carried
vs through, had there beene a pa&s;&s;age, yet we had a &s;mooth and
calme &s;ea, with ordinary flowing and reflowing, which could
not haue beene, had there beene a frete: of which we rather in|fallibly
concluded then coniectured, that there was none. But to
returne.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="Iune"> The next day after our comming to anchor in the afore&s;aid har|bour,
the people of the countrey &s;hewed them&s;elues; &s;ending
off a man with great expedition to vs in a canow. Who being
yet but a little from the &s;hoare, and a great way from our &s;hip,
&s;pake to vs continually as he came rowing on. And at la&s;t at a
rea&s;onable di&s;tance &s;taying him&s;elfe, he began more &s;olemnely
a long and tedious oration, after his manner: v&s;ing in the deli|uerie
thereof, many ge&s;tures and &s;ignes; mouing his hands, tur|ning
his head and body many wayes; and after his oration en|ded,
with great &s;hew of reuerence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, returned back
to &s;hoare againe. He &s;hortly came againe the &s;econd time in like
manner, and &s;o the third time: When he brought with him (as a
pre&s;ent from the re&s;t) a bunch of feathers, much like the feathers
of a blacke crow, very neatly and artificially gathered vpon a
&s;tring, and drawne together into a round bundle, being verie
<PB N="68" REF="39">
cleane and finely cut, and bearing in length an equall proportion
one with another; a &s;peciall cognizance (as wee afterwards ob|&s;erued)
which they that guard their kings per&s;on, weare on their
heads. With this al&s;o he brought a little basket made of ru&s;hes,
and filled with an herbe which they called <HI>Tab&aacute;h.</HI> Both which
being tyed to a &s;hort rodde, he ca&s;t into our boate. Our Generall
intended to haue recompenced him immediatly with many
good things, he would haue be&s;towed vpon him: but entring
into the boate to deliuer the &s;ame, he could not be drawne to
receiue them by any meanes: &s;aue one hat, which being ca&s;t into
the water out of the &s;hip, he tooke vp (refu&s;ing vtterly to meddle
with any other thing, though it were vpon a board put off vnto
him) and &s;o pre&s;ently made his returne. After which time, our
boate could row no way, but wondring at vs as at gods, they
would follow, the &s;ame with admiration.</P>
<P>The 3. day following, viz. <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="Ian."> the 21. our &s;hip hauing receiued
a leake at &s;ea, wa&s; brought to-anchor neerer the &s;hoare, that
her goods being landed, &s;he might be repaired: but for that
we were to preuent any danger, that might chance again&s;t our
&s;afety, our generall fir&s;t of all landed his men, with all nece&s;&s;ary
proui&s;ion, to build tents and make a fort for the defence of our
&s;elues and goods: and that wee might vnder the &s;helter of it,
with more &s;afety (what euer &s;hould befall) end our bu&s;in&s;&s;e;
which when the people of the country perceiued vs doing, as
men &s;et on fire to war, in defence of their countrie, in great ha&s;t
and companies, with &s;uch weapons as they had, they came
downe vnto vs; and yet with no ho&s;tile meaning, or intent to
hurt vs: &s;tanding when they drew neere, as men raui&s;hed in
their mindes, with the &s;ight of &s;uch things as they neuer had
&s;eene, or heard of before that time: their errand being rather
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and feare to wor&s;hip vs as Gods, then to haue
any warre with vs as with mortall men. Which thing as it did
partly &s;hew it &s;elfe at that in&s;tant, &s;o did it more and more ma|nife&s;t
it &s;elfe afterwards, during the whole time of our abode
among&s;t them. At this time, being willed by &s;ignes to lay from
<PB N="69" REF="39">
them their bowes and arrowes, they did as they were directed,
and &s;o did all the re&s;t, as they came more and more by compa|nies
vnto them, growing in a little while, to a great number
both of men and women.</P>
<P>To the intent therefore, that this peace which they them&s;elues
&s;o willingly &s;ought, might without any cau&s;e of the breach
thereof, on our part giuen, be continued; and that wee might
with more &s;afety and expedition, end our bu&s;ine&s;&s;es in quiet;
our Generall with all his company, v&s;ed all meanes po&s;&s;ible,
gently to intreate them, be&s;towing vpon each of them liberally,
good and nece&s;&s;ary things to couer their nakedne&s;&s;e, withall &s;ig|nifying
vnto them, we were no Gods but men, and had neede
of &s;uch things to couer our owne &s;hame; teaching them to v&s;e
them to the &s;ame ends: for which cau&s;e al&s;o wee did eate and
drinke in their pre&s;ence, giuing them to vnder&s;tand, that with|out
that wee could not liue, and therefore were but men as
well as they.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding nothing could per&s;wade them, nor re|moue
that opinion, which they had conceiued of vs, that wee
&s;hould be Gods.</P>
<P>In recompence of tho&s;e things which they had receiued of vs,
as &s;hirts linnen cloth, &amp;c. they be&s;towed vpon our generall, and
diuer&s;e of our company, diuer&s;e things, as feathers, cawles of
networke, the quiuers of their arrowes, made of fawne-skins,
and the very skins of bea&s;ts that their women wore vpon their
bodies. Hauing thus had their fill of this times vi&s;iting and be|holding
of vs, they departed with ioy to their hou&s;es, which
hou&s;es are digged round within the earth, and haue from the
vppermo&s;t brimmes of the circle, clefts of wood &s;et vp, and ioy|ned
clo&s;e together at the top, like our &s;pires on the &s;teeple of a
Church: which being couered with earth, &s;uffer no water to en|ter,
and are very warme, the doore in the mo&s;t part of them,
performes the office al&s;o of a chimney, to let out the &s;moake:
its made in bigne&s;&s;e and fa&s;hion, like to an ordinary &s;cuttle in a
&s;hip, and &s;tanding &s;lopewi&s;e: their beds are the hard ground,
<PB N="70" REF="40">
onely with ru&s;hes &s;trewed vpon it, and lying round about the
hou&s;e, haue their fire in the midde&s;t, which by rea&s;on that the
hou&s;e is but low vaulted, round and clo&s;e, giueth a maruelous
reflexion to their bodies to heate the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Their men for the mo&s;t part goe naked, the women take a|kinde
of bulru&s;hes, and kembing it after the manner of hempe,
make them&s;elues thereof a loo&s;e garment, which being knitte a|bout
their middles, hanges downe about their hippes, and &s;o af|fordes
to them a couering of that, which nature teaches &s;hould
be hidden: about their &s;houlders, they weare al&s;o the skin of a
deere, with the haire vpon it. They are very obedient to their-husbands,
and exceeding ready in all &s;eruices: yet of them|&s;elues
offring to do nothing, without the con&s;ents, or being cal|led
of the men.</P>
<P>As &s;oone as they were returned to their hou&s;es, they began a|mong&s;t
them&s;elues a kind of mo&s;t lamentable weeping &amp; crying
out; which they continued al&s;o a great while together, in &s;uch
&s;ort, that in the place where they left vs (being neere about 3.
quarters of an Engli&s;h mile di&s;tant from them) we very plaine|ly,
with wonder and admiration did heare the &s;ame: the women
e&s;pecially, extending their voices, in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable and dole|full
manner of &s;hreeking.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this humble manner of pre&s;enting them|&s;elues,
and awfull demeanour v&s;ed towards vs, we thought it
no wi&s;edowe too farre to tru&s;t them (our experience of former
Infidels dealing with vs before, made vs carefull to prouide a|gain&s;t
an alteration of their affections, or breach of peace if it
&s;hould happen) and therefore with all expedition we &s;et vp our
tents, and entrenched our &s;elues with walls of &s;tone: that &s;o be|ing
fortified within our &s;elues, we might be able to keepe off the
enemie (if they &s;hould &s;o proue) from comming among&s;t vs
without our good wills: this being quickly fini&s;hed we went
the more cheerefully and &s;ecurely afterward, about our other
bu&s;ine&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the end of two daies (during which time they had
<PB N="71" REF="40">
not againe beene with vs) there was gathered together a great
a&s;&s;embly of men, women, and children (inuited by the report of
them which fir&s;t &s;aw vs, who as it &s;eemes, had in that time, of
purpo&s;e di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elues into the country, to make knowne
the newes) who came now the &s;econd time vnto vs, bringing
with them as before had beene done, feathers and bagges of <HI>To|b&agrave;h</HI>
for pre&s;ents, or rather indeed for &s;acrifices, vpon this per|&s;wa&s;ion
that we were Gods.</P>
<P>When they came to the top of the hill, at the bottome
whereof wee had built our fort, they made a &s;tand; where one
(appointed as their chiefe &s;peaker) wearied both vs his hearers,
and him&s;elfe too, with a long and tedious oration: deliuered
with &s;trange and violent ge&s;tures, his voice being extended to
the vttermo&s;t &s;trength of nature, and his words falling &s;o thicke
one in the neck of another, that he could hardly fetch his breath
againe: as &s;oone as he had concluded, all the re&s;t, with a reue|rend
bowing of their bodies (in a dreaming manner, and long
producing of the &s;ame) cryed <HI>Oh:</HI> thereby giuing their con&s;ents,
that all was very true which he had &s;poken, and that they had vt|tered
their minde by his mouth vnto vs; which done, the men
laying downe their bowes vpon the hill, and leauing their wo|men
and children behinde them, came downe with their pre|&s;ents;
in &s;uch &s;ort, as if they had appeared before a God in|deed:
thinking them&s;elues happy, that they might haue acce&s;&s;e
vnto our generall, but much more happy, when they &s;awe that
he would receiue at their hands, tho&s;e things which they &s;o wil|lingly
had pre&s;ented: and no doubt, they thought them&s;elues
neere&s;t vnto God, when they &s;ate or &s;tood next to him: In the
meane time the women, as if they had beene de&s;perate, v&s;ed vn|naturall
violence again&s;t them&s;elues, crying and &s;hreeking pite|ou&s;ly,
tearing their fle&s;h with their nailes from their cheekes, in
a mon&s;trous manner, the blood &s;treaming downe along their
bre&s;ts; be&s;ides de&s;poiling the vpper parts of their bodies, of
tho&s;e &s;ingle couerings they formerly had, and holding their
hands aboue their heads, that they might not re&s;cue their bre&s;ts
<PB N="72" REF="41">
from harme, they would with furie ca&s;t them&s;elues vpon the
ground, neuer re&s;pecting whether it were cleane or &s;oft, but
da&s;hed them&s;elues in this manner on hard &s;tones, knobby, hil|locks,
&s;tocks of wood, and pricking bu&s;hes, or what euer el&s;e lay
in their way, itterating the &s;ame cour&s;e againe and againe: yea
women great with child, &s;ome nine or ten times each, and others
holding out till 15. or 16. times (till their &s;trengths failed them)
exerci&s;ed this cruelty again&s;t them&s;elues: A thing more grieuous
for vs to &s;ee, or &s;uffer could we haue holpe it, then trouble to
them (as it &s;eemed) to do it.</P>
<P>This bloudie &s;acrifie (again&s;t our wils) being thus perfor|med,
our Generall with his companie in the prefence of tho&s;e
&s;trangers fell to prayers: and by &s;ignes in lifting vp our eyes and
hands to heauen, &s;ignified vnto them, that that God whom we
did &s;erue, and whom they ought to wor&s;hip, was aboue: Be&s;ee|ching
God if it were his good plea&s;ure to-open by &s;ome meanes
their blinded eyes; that they might in due time be called to the
knowledge of him the true and euerliuing God, and of Ie&s;us
Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, the &s;aluation of the Gentiles. In the
time of which prayers, &s;inging of P&s;almes, and reading of cer|taine
Chapters in the Bible, they &s;ate very attentiuely: and ob|&s;eruing
the end at euery pau&s;e, with one voice &s;till cryed, Oh,
greatly rejoycing in our exerci&s;es. Yea they tooke &s;uch plea&s;ure
in our &s;inging of P&s;almes, that when&s;oeuer they re&s;orted to vs,
their fir&s;t reque&s;t was commonly this, <HI>Gna&aacute;h,</HI> by which they in|treated
that we would &s;ing.</P>
<P>Our General hauing now be&s;towed vpon them diuers things,
at their departure they re&s;tored them all againe; none carrying
with him any thing of what&s;oeuer hee had receiued, thinking
them&s;elues &s;ufficiently enriched and happie, that they had found
&s;o free acce&s;&s;e to &s;ee vs.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the end of three daies more (the newes hauing the
while &s;pread it &s;elf farther, and as it &s;eemed a great way vp into
the countrie) were a&s;&s;embled the greate&s;t number of people,
which wee could rea&s;onably imagine, to dwell within any con|uenient
<PB N="73" REF="41">
di&s;tance round about. Among&s;t the re&s;t, the king him|&s;elfe,
a man of a goodly &s;tature and comely per&s;onage attended
with his guard, of about 100. tall and warlike men, this day, viz.
<MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="Iune"> Iune 26. came downe to &s;ee vs.</P>
<P>Before his comming, were &s;ent two Emba&s;&s;adors or me&s;&s;en|gers
to our Generall, to &s;ignifie that their <HI>Hi&oacute;h,</HI> that is, their king
was coming and at hand. They in the deliuery of their me&s;|&s;age,
the one &s;pake with a &s;oft and low voice, prompting his fel|low;
the other pronounced the &s;ame word by word after him,
with a voice more audible: continuing their proclamation (for
&s;uch it was) about halfe an houre. Which being ended, they by
&s;ignes made reque&s;t to our Generall, to &s;end &s;omething by their
hands to their <HI>Hi&oacute;h</HI> or king, as a token that his comming might
be in peace. Our Generall willingly &s;atisfied their de&s;ire; and
they, glad men, made &s;peedy returne to their <HI>Hi&oacute;h:</HI> Neither was
it long before their king (making as princely a &s;hew as po&s;&s;ibly
he could) with all his traine came forward.</P>
<P>In their coming forwards they cryed continually after a
&s;inging manner with a lu&s;tie courage. And as they drew neerer
and neerer towards vs, &s;o did they more and more &s;triue to be|haue
them&s;elues with a certaine comeline&s;&s;e and grauity in all
their actions.</P>
<P>In the forefront came a man of a large body and goodly a&s;|pect
bearing the Septer or royall mace (made of a certaine kind
of blacke wood, and in length about a yard and a halfe) before
the king. Whereupon hanged two crownes, a bigger and a le&s;&s;e,
with three chaines of a maruellous length, and often doubled;
be&s;ides a bagge of the herbe <HI>Tab&aacute;h.</HI> The crownes were made of
knitworke, wrought vpon mo&s;t curiou&s;ly with feathers of di|uers
colours, very artificially placed, and of a formall fa&s;hion:
The chaines &s;eemed of a bony &s;ub&s;tance: euery linke or part
thereof being very little, thinne, mo&s;t finely burni&s;hed, with a
hole pierced through the midde&s;t. The number of linkes going
to make one chaine, is in a manner infinite: but of &s;uch e&s;tima|tion
it s among&s;t them, that few be the per&s;ons that are admit|ted
<PB N="74" REF="42">
to weare the &s;ame: and euen they to whom its lawfull to v&s;e
them, yet are &s;tinted what number they &s;hall v&s;e; as &s;ome ten,
&s;ome twelue, &s;ome twentie, and as they exceed in number of
chaines, &s;o are they thereby knowne to be the more honorable
per&s;onages.</P>
<P>Next vnto him that bare his Scepter, was the king him&s;elfe
with his guard about him: His attire vpon his head was a cawle
of knitworke, wrought vpon &s;omewhat like the crownes, but
differing much both in fa&s;hion and perfectne&s;&s;e of worke; vpon
his &s;houlders he had on a coate of the skins of conies, reaching
to his wa&s;t: His guard al&s;o had each coats of the &s;ame &s;hape, but
of other skins:&s;ome hauing cawles likewi&s;e &s;tucke with feathers,
or couered ouer with a certaine downe, which groweth vp in
the countrey vpon an herbe much like our lectuce; which ex|ceeds
any other downe in the world for finene&s;&s;e, and beeing
layed vpon their cawles by no winds can be remoued: Of &s;uch
e&s;timation is this herbe among&s;t them, that the downe thereof
is not lawfull to be worne, but of &s;uch per&s;ons as are about the
king (to whom al&s;o it is permitted to weare plume of feathers
on their heads, in &s;igne of honour) and the &s;eeds are not v&s;ed but
onely in &s;acrifice to their gods. After the&s;e in their order, did fol|low
the naked &s;ort of common people; who&s;e haire being long,
was gathered into a bunch behind, in which &s;tucke plumes of
feathers, but in the forepart onely &s;ingle feathers like hornes,
euery one plea&s;ing him&s;elfe in his owne deuice.</P>
<P>This one thing was ob&s;erued to bee generall among&s;t them
all; that euery one had his face painted, &s;ome which white, &s;ome
blacke, and &s;ome with other colours, euery man al&s;o bringing in

hauing within them diuers things, as bagges of <HI>Tob&acirc;h,</HI> a roote
which they call <HI>Pet&aacute;h,</HI> whereof they make a kind of meale, and
either bake it into bread, or eate it raw; broyled fi&s;hes like a

<P><PB N="75" REF="42">
Their baskets were made in fa&s;hion like a deepe boale, and
though the matter were ru&s;hes, or &s;uch other kind of &s;tuffe, yet
was it &s;o cunningly handled, that the mo&s;t part of them would
hold water; about the brimmes they were hanged with peeces
of the &s;hels of pearles, and in &s;ome places with two or three
linkes at a place, of the chaines forenamed: thereby &s;ignifying,
that they were ve&s;&s;els wholly dedicated to the onely v&s;e of the
gods they wor&s;hipped: and be&s;ides this, they were wrought vp|pon
with the matted downe of red feathers, di&s;tingui&s;hed into
diuers workes and formes.</P>
<P>In the meane time our Generall hauing a&s;&s;embled his men
together (as foreca&s;ting the danger, and wor&s;t that might fall
our) prepared him&s;elfe to &s;tand vpon &s;ure ground, that wee
might at all times be ready in our owne defence, if any thing
&s;hould chance otherwi&s;e then was looked for or expected.</P>
<P>Wherefore euery man being in a warlike readine&s;&s;e, he mar|ched
within his fenced place, making again&s;t their approach a
mo&s;t warlike &s;hew (as he did al&s;o at all other times of their re|&s;ort)
whereby if they had beene de&s;perate enemies, they could
not haue cho&s;en but haue conceiued terrour and feare, with di&s;|couragement
to attempt any thing again&s;t vs, in beholding of
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When they were come &s;omewhat neere vnto vs, trooping
togetehr, they gaue vs a common or a generall &s;alutation: ob|&s;eruing
in the meane time a generall &s;ilence. Whereupon he
who bare the Scepter before the king, being prompted by ano|ther
whom the king a&s;&s;igned to that office, pronounced with an
audible and manly voice, what the other &s;pake to him in &s;ecret:
continuing, whether it were his oration or proclamation, at the
lea&s;t halfe an houre. At the clo&s;e whereof, there was a common
<HI>Amen,</HI> in &s;igne of approbation giuen by euery per&s;on: And the
king him&s;elfe with the whole number of men and women (the
little children onely remaining behind) came further downe the
hill, and as they came &s;et them&s;elues againe in their former
order.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="43">
And being now come to the foot of the hill and neere out
fort, the Scepter bearer with a compo&s;ed countenance and
&s;tately carriage began a &s;ong, and an&s;werable thereunto, ob&s;er|ued
a kind of mea&s;ures in a dance: whom the king with his guard
and euery other &s;ort of per&s;on following, did in like manner &s;ing
and daunce, &s;auing onely the women who danced but kept &s;i|lence.
As they danced they &s;till came on: and our Generall per|ceiuing
their plaine and &s;imple meaning, gaue order that they
might freely enter without interruption within our bulwarke:
Where after they had entred they yet continued their &s;ong and
dance a rea&s;onable time: their women al&s;o following them with
their wa&s;&s;aile boales in their hands, their bodies brui&s;ed, their
faces torne, their dugges, brea&s;ts, and other parts be&s;potted with
bloud, trickling downe from the wounds, which with their nailes
they had made before their comming.</P>
<P>After that they had &s;atisfied or rather tired them&s;elues in this
manner, they made &s;ignes to our Generall to haue him &s;it down;
Vnto whom both the king and diuers others made &s;euerall ora|tions,
or rather indeed if wee, had vnder&s;tood them, &s;upplicati|ons,
that hee would take the Prouince and kingdome into his
hand, and become their king and patron: making &s;ignes that
they would re&s;igne vnto him their right and title in the whole
land, and become his va&s;&s;als in them&s;elues and their po&s;terities:
Which that they might make vs ind&eacute;ed beleeue that it was their
true meaning and intent; the king him&s;elfe with all the re&s;t with
one con&s;ent, and with great reuerence, ioyfully &s;inging a &s;ong,
&s;et the crowne vpon his head; inriched his necke with all their
chaines; and offering vnto him many other things, honoured
him by the name of <HI>Hy&oacute;h.</HI> Adding thereunto (as it might &s;eeme)
a &s;ong and dance of triumph: becau&s;e they were not onely vi&s;i|ted
of the gods (for &s;o they &s;till iudged vs to be) but the great and
chiefe god was now become their god, their king and patron,
and them&s;elues were become the onely happie and ble&s;&s;ed peo|ple
in all the World.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being &s;o freely offered, our Generall thought
<PB N="77" REF="43">
not meet to reiect or refu&s;e the &s;ame: both for that he would
not giue them any cau&s;e of mi&s;tru&s;t, or di&s;liking of him (that be|ing
the onely place, wherein at this pre&s;ent, we were of nece&s;&s;i|tie
inforced to &s;eeke reliefe of many things) and chiefely, for that
he knew not to what good end God had brought this to pa&s;&s;e,
or what honour and profit it might bring to our countrie in
time to come.</P>
<P>Wherefore in the name and to the v&s;e of her mo&s;t excellent
maie&s;ty, he tooke the &s;cepter crowne and dignity, of the &s;ayd
countrie into his hand; wi&s;hing nothing more, then that it had
layen &s;o fitly for her maie&s;ty to enioy, as it was now her proper
owne, and that the riches and trea&s;ures thereof (wherewith in
the vpland countries it abounds) might with as great conueni|ency
be tran&s;ported, to the enriching of her kingdome here at
home, as it is in plenty to be attained there: and e&s;pecially, that
&s;o tractable and louing a people, as they &s;hewed them&s;elues to
be, might haue meanes to haue manife&s;ted their mo&s;t willing
obedience the more vnto her, and by her meanes, as a mother
and nur&s;e of the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> might by the preaching of
the Go&s;pell, be brought to the right knowledge, and obedience
of the true and euerliuing God.</P>
<P>The ceremonies of this re&s;igning, and receiuing of the king|dome
being thus performed, the common &s;ort both of men and
women, leauing the king and his guard about him, with our
generall, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elues among our people, taking a dili|gent
view or &s;uruey of euery man; and finding &s;uch as plea&s;ed
their fancies (which commonly were the younge&s;t of vs) they
pre&s;ently enclo&s;ing them about, offred their &s;acrifices vnto
them, crying out with lamentable &s;hreekes and moanes, wee|ping,
and &s;cratching, and tearing their very fle&s;h off their faces
with their nailes, neither were it the women alone which did
this, but euen old men, roaring and crying out, were as violent
as the women were.</P>
<P>We groaned in &s;pirit to &s;ee the power of Sathan &s;o farre pre|uaile,
in &s;educing the&s;e &s;o harmele&s;&s;e &s;oules, and laboured by all
<PB N="78" REF="44">
means, both by &s;hewing our great di&s;like, and when that &s;erued
not, by violent withholding of their hands from that madne&s;&s;e,
directing them (by our eyes and hands lift vp towards heauen)
to the liuing God whom they ought to &s;erue: but &s;o mad were
they vpon their Idolatry, that forcible withholding them wou'd
not preuaile (for as &s;oone as they could get liberty to their
hands againe, they would be as violent as they were before) till
&s;uch time, as they when they wor&s;hipped, were conueyed from
them into the tents, whom yet as men de&s;ides them&s;elues, they
would with fury and outrage &s;eeke to haue againe.</P>
<P>After that time had a little qualified their madnes, they then
began to &s;hew &amp; make knowne vnto vs their griefes and di&s;ea&s;es
which they carried about them, &s;ome of them hauing old aches,
&s;ome &s;hruncke &s;inewes, &s;ome old &s;oares and canckred vlcers,
&s;ome wounds more lately receiued, and the like, in mo&s;t lamen|table
manner crauing helpe and cure thereof from vs: making
&s;ignes, that if we did but blowe vpon their griefes, or but tou|ched
the di&s;ea&s;ed places, they would be whole.</P>
<P>Their griefes we could not but take pitty on them, and to
our power de&s;ire to helpe them: but that (if it plea&s;ed God to
open their eyes) they might vnder&s;tand we were but men and
no gods, we v&s;ed ordinary meanes, as lotions, emplai&s;ters, and
vnguents mo&s;t fitly (as farre as our skills could gue&s;&s;e) agreeing
to the natures of their griefes, be&s;eeching God, if it made for
his glory, to giue cure to their di&s;ea&s;es by the&s;e meanes. The
like we did from time to time as they re&s;orted to vs.</P>
<P>Few were the dayes, wherein they were ab&s;ent from vs, du|ring
the whole time of our abode in that place: and ordinarily
euery third day, they brought their &s;acrifices, till &s;uch time, as
they certainely vnder&s;tood our meaning, that we tooke no plea|&s;ure,
but were di&s;plea&s;ed with them: whereupon their zeale a|bated,
and their &s;acrificing, for a &s;ea&s;on, to our good liking cea|&s;ed;
not-with&s;tanding they continued &s;till to make their re&s;ort
vnto vs in great abundance, and in &s;uch &s;ort, that they oft-times
forgate, to prouide meate for their owne &s;u&s;tenance; &s;o that
<PB N="79" REF="44">
our generall (of whom they made account as of a father) was
faine to performe the office of a father to them, relieuing them
with &s;uch victualls, as we had prouided for our &s;elues, as, Mu&s;|cles,
Scales, and &s;uch like, wherein they tooke exceeding much
content; and &s;eeing that their &s;acrifices were di&s;plea&s;ing to vs,
yet (hating ingratitude) they &s;ought to recompence vs, with
&s;uch things as they had, which they willingly inforced vpon vs,
though it were neuer &s;o nece&s;&s;arie or needfull for them&s;elues to
keepe.</P>
<P>They are a people of a tractable, free, and louing nature, with|out
guile or treachery; they bowes and arrowes (their only wea|pons,
and almo&s;t all their wealth) they v&s;e very skillfully, but yet
not to do any great harme with them, being by rea&s;on of their
weakene&s;&s;e, more fit for children then for men, &s;ending the ar|row
neither farre off, nor with any great force: and yet are the
men commonly &s;o &s;trong of body, that that, which 2. or 3. of
our men could hardly beare, one of them would take vpon his
backe, and without grudging carrie it ea&s;ily away, vp hill and
downe hill an Engli&s;h mile together: they are al&s;o exceeding
&s;wift in running, and of long continuance; the v&s;e whereof is &s;o
familiar with them, that they &s;eldome goe, but for the mo&s;t
part runne. One thing we ob&s;erued in them with admiration:
that if at any time, they chanced to &s;ee a fi&s;h, &s;o neere the &s;hoare,
that they might reach the place without &s;wimming, they would
neuer, or very &s;eldome mi&s;&s;e to take it.</P>
<P>After that our nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;&s;es were well di&s;patched, our
generall with his gentlemen, and many of his company, made a
journy vp into the land, to &s;ee the manner of their dwelling,
and to be the better acquainted, with the nature and commodi|ties
of the country. Their hou&s;es were all &s;uch as wee haue for|merly
de&s;cribed, and being many of them in one place, made
&s;euerall villages here and there. The inland we found to be farre
different from the &s;hoare, a goodly country, and fruitfull &s;oyle,
&s;tored with many ble&s;&s;ings fit for the v&s;e of man: infinite was
the company of very large and fat Deere, which there we &s;awe
<PB N="80" REF="45">
by thou&s;ands, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, in a heard: be&s;ides a multitude
of a &s;trange kinde of Conies, by farre exceeding them in num|ber:
their heads and bodies, in which they re&s;emble other Co|nies,
are but &s;mall; his tayle like the tayle of a Rat, exceeding
long;and his feet like the pawes of a Want or Moale; vnder his
chinne, on either &s;ide, he hath a bagge, into which he gathereth
his meate, when he hath filled his belly abroade, that he may
with it, either feed his young, or feed him&s;elfe, when he li&s;ts
not to trauaile from his burrough: the people eate their bodies,
and make great account of their skinnes, for their kings holi|daies
coate was made of them.</P>
<P>This country our generall named <HI>Albion,</HI> and that for two
cau&s;es; the one in re&s;pect of the white bancks and cliffes, which
lie toward the &s;ea: the other, that it might haue &s;ome affinity,
euen in name al&s;o, with our owne country, which was &s;ome|time
&s;o called.</P>
<P>Before we went from thence, our generall cau&s;ed to be &s;et vp,
a monument of our being there; as al&s;o of her maie&s;ties, and
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors right and title to that kingdome, namely, a plate of
bra&s;&s;e, fa&s;t nailed to a great and firme po&s;t; whereon is engra|uen
her graces name, and the day and yeare of our arriuall
there, and of the free giuing vp, of the prouince and kingdome,
both by the king and people, into her maie&s;ties hands: toge|ther
with her highne&s;&s;e picture, and armes in a piece of &s;ixpence
currant Engli&s;h monie, &s;hewing it &s;elfe by a hole made of pur|po&s;e
through the plate: vnderneath was likewi&s;e engrauen the

<P>The Spaniards neuer had any dealing, or &s;o much as &s;et a
foote in this country; the vtmo&s;t of their di&s;coueries, reaching
onely to many degrees Southward of this place.</P>
<P>And now, as the time of our departure was perceiued by
them to draw nigh, &s;o did the &s;orrowes and mi&s;eries of this peo|ple,
&s;eeme to them&s;elues to increa&s;e vpon them; and the more
certaine they were of our going away, the more doubtfull they
&s;hewed them&s;elues, what they might doe; &s;o that we might ea|&s;ily
<PB N="81" REF="45">
iudge that that ioy (being exceeding great) wherewith they
receiued vs at our fir&s;t arriuall, was cleane drowned in their ex|ce&s;&s;iue
&s;orrow for our departing: For they did not onely loo&s;e
on a &s;udden all mirth, ioy, glad countenance, plea&s;ant &s;peeches,
agility of body, familiar reioycing one with another, and all
plea&s;ure what euer fle&s;h and bloud might bee delighted in, but
with &s;ighes and &s;orrowings, with heauy hearts and grieued
minds, they powred out wofull complaints and moanes, with
bitter teares and wringing of their hands, tormenting them|&s;elues.
And as men refu&s;ing all comfort, they onely accounted
them&s;elues as ca&s;t-awayes, and tho&s;e whom the gods were a|bout
to for&s;ake: So that nothing we could &s;ay or do, was able to
ea&s;e them of their &s;o heauy a burthen, or to deliuer them from
&s;o de&s;perate a &s;traite, as our leauing of them did &s;eeme to them
that it would ca&s;t them into.</P>
<P>Howbeit &s;eeing they could not &s;till enioy our pre&s;ence, they
(&s;uppo&s;ing vs to be gods indeed) thought it their duties to in|treate
vs that being ab&s;ent, we would yet be mindfull of them,
and making &s;ignes of their de&s;ires, that in time to come wee
would &s;ee them againe, they &s;tole vpon vs a &s;acrifice, and &s;et it
on fire erre we were aware; burning therein a chaine and a bunch
of feathers. We laboured by all meanes po&s;&s;ible to withhold
or withdraw them but could not preuaile, till at la&s;t we fell to
prayers and &s;inging of P&s;almes, whereby they were allured im|mediatly
to forget their folly, and leaue their &s;acrifice vncon&s;u|med,
&s;uffering the fire to go out, and imitating vs in all our acti|ons;
they fell a lifting vp their eyes and hands to heauen as they
&s;aw vs do.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="Iuly"> The 23. of Iuly they tooke a &s;orrowfull farewell of vs, but be|ing
loath to leaue vs, they pre&s;ently ranne to the tops of the hils

<P>Not farre without this harborough did lye certaine Ilands

that the extremity of the cold not only continued but increa&s;ed,
the Sunne being gone farther from vs, and that the wind blow|ing

finding a pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e Northerne parts, thought it
nece&s;&s;arie to loo&s;e no time; and therefore with generall con&s;ent

<P>Their canowes were made after the fa&s;hion, that the canowes
of all the re&s;t of the Ilands of Moluccas for the mo&s;t part are:
That is of one tree, hollowed within with great art and cunning,
being made &s;o &s;mooth both within and without, that they bore
a glo&s;&s;e, as if it were a harne&s;&s;e mo&s;t finely burni&s;hed: A prowe
and &s;terne they had of one fa&s;hion, yeelding inward in manner
of a &s;emicircle, of a great height, and hanged full of certaine
white and gli&s;tering &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">ls for brauery: One each &s;ide of their ca|nows,
lay out two peeces of timber about a yard and halfe long,
more or le&s;&s;e according to the capacitie of their boate. At the
ends whereof was fa&s;tned cro&s;&s;ewi&s;e a great cane, the v&s;e where|of

might be equally borne vp on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>The people them&s;elues haue the neather parts of their eares

cut round or circlewi&s;e, hanging downe very low vpon their
cheeks, wherein they hang things of a rea&s;onable weight: the
nailes on the fingers of &s;ome of them, were at lea&s;t an inch long,
and their teeth as blacke as pitch; the colour whereof they v&s;e to
renew by often eating of an herbe, with a kind of powder, which
in a cane they carrie about them to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The fir&s;t
&s;ort and company of tho&s;e canowes beeing come to our &s;hip
(which then by rea&s;on of a &s;cant wind made little way) very &s;ub|tilly
and again&s;t their natures, began in peace to traffique with
vs, giuing vs one thing for another very orderly, intending (as
we perceiued) hereby to worke a greater mi&s;chiefe to vs: Intrea|ting
vs by &s;ignes mo&s;t earne&s;tly to draw neerer towards the
&s;hore, that they might (if po&s;&s;ible) make the ea&s;ier prey both of
the &s;hip and vs. But the&s;e pa&s;&s;ing away, and others continually
re&s;orting, wee were quickly able to gue&s;&s;e at them what they
were: For if they receiued any thing once into their hands, they
would neither giue recompence nor re&s;titution of it, but
thought what euer they could finger to bee their owne: Ex|pecting
always with browes of bra&s;&s;e to receiue more, but
would part with nothing: Yea being reiected for their bad dea|ling,
as tho&s;e with whom we would haue no more to do, v&s;ing
vs &s;o euilly, they could not be &s;atisfied till they had giuen the at|tempt
to reuenge them&s;elues, becau&s;e we would not giue them
what&s;oeuer they would haue for nothing: And hauing &s;tones
good &s;tore in their canowes, let flie a maine of them again&s;t vs.
It was farre from our Generals meaning to requite their malice
by like iniurie. Yet that they might know that be had power to
doe them harme (if he had li&s;ted) he cau&s;ed a great peece to be
&s;hot off not to hurt them but to affright them. Which wrought
the de&s;ired effect among&s;t them, for at the noi&s;e thereof, they
euery one leaped out of his canow into the water, and diuing
vnder the keele of their boates, &s;taied them from going any way
till our &s;hip was gone a good way from them. Then they all
lightly recouered into their canowes, and got them with &s;peed

4. his deputy or Viceroy with all expedition came off to
our &s;hip in a canow, and without any feare or doubting of our
good meaning came pre&s;ently aboard. Who after &s;ome confe|rence
with our Generall, intreated him by any meanes to runne
with <HI>Terenate,</HI> not with <HI>Tidore,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him that his king would
be wondrous glad of his comming, and be ready to do for him
what he could, and what our Generall in rea&s;on &s;hould require:
For which purpo&s;e he him&s;elfe would that night bee with his
king to carry him the newes: with whom if he once dealt, he
&s;hould find, that as he was a king &s;o his word &s;hould &s;tand; wher|as
if he dealt with the Portingals (who had the command of
<HI>Tidore</HI>) he &s;hould find in them nothing but deceit and treache|ry.
And be&s;ides that if he went to <HI>Tidore</HI> before he came to <HI>Tere|nate,</HI>
than would his king haue nothing to doe with vs, for he
held the Portingall as an enemy. On the&s;e per&s;wa&s;ions our Ge|nerall
re&s;olued to runne with <HI>Terenate,</HI> where the next day very
early in the morning we came to anchor: And pre&s;ently, our Ge|neral
&s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the king with a veluet cloake, for a pre|&s;ent
and token that his comming &s;hould be in peace: and that
he required no other thing at his hands, but that (his victuals
being &s;pent in &s;o long a voiage) he might haue &s;upply from him
by way of traffique and exchange of marchandi&s;e (whereof he
had &s;tore of diuers &s;orts) of &s;uch things as he wanted. Which
he thought he might be the bolder to require at his hands, both
for that the thing was lawfull, and that he offered him no preiu|dice
or wrong therein, as al&s;o becau&s;e he was intreated to re|paire
to that place by his Viceroy at Mutir, who a&s;&s;ured him of
nece&s;&s;arie proui&s;ion in &s;uch manner as now he required the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>Before this, the Viceroy according to his promi&s;e had beene
with the king, &s;ignifying vnto him what a mighty Prince and
kingdome we belonged vnto, what good things the king might
receiue from vs, not onely now, but for hereafter by way of
<PB N="86" REF="48">
traffique: yea what honour and benefit it might be to him, to be
in league and friend&s;hip with &s;o noble and famous a Prince as
we &s;erued: And farther what a di&s;couragement it would be to
the Portugals his enemies to heare and &s;ee it: In hearing whereof
the king was &s;o pre&s;ently moued to the well liking of the matter,
that before our me&s;&s;enger could come halfe the way, he had
&s;ent the Viceroy with diuers others of his Nobles and Coun|cellors
to our Generall, with &s;peciall me&s;&s;age that he &s;hould not
onely haue what things he needed, or would require with peace
and friend&s;hip, but that be would willingly entertaine amitie
with &s;o famous and renowned a Princes as was ours, and that
if it &s;eemed good in her eyes to accept of it, he would &s;eque&s;ter
the commodities and traffique of his whole Iland from others,
e&s;pecially from his enemies the Portugals (from whom he had
nothing but by the &s;word) and re&s;erue it to the intercour&s;e of
our Nation, if we would embrace it: In token whereof he had
now &s;ent to our Generall his &s;ignet, and would within &s;hort time
after, come in his owne per&s;on with his brethren and Nobles
with boats or canowes into our &s;hip, and be a meanes of bring|ing
her into a &s;afer harbour.</P>
<P>While they were deliuering their me&s;&s;age to vs, our me&s;&s;en|ger
was come vnto the Court, who being met by the way by
certaine noble per&s;onages, was with great &s;olemnitie conueied
into the kings pre&s;ence: at who&s;e hands he was mo&s;t friendly
and graciou&s;ly entertained, and hauing deliuered his errand to|gether
with his pre&s;ent vnto the king, the king &s;eemed to him to
iudge him&s;elfe blame-worthy, that he had not &s;ooner ha&s;ted in
per&s;on to pre&s;ent him&s;elfe to our Generall, who came &s;o farre
and from &s;o great a Prince; And pre&s;ently with all expedition, he
made ready him&s;elfe with the chiefe&s;t of all his States and
Councellors to make repaire vnto vs.</P>
<P>The manner of his comming as it was princely, &s;o truly it &s;ee|med
to vs very &s;trange &amp; maruellous: &s;eruing at the pre&s;ent not
&s;o much to &s;et out his owne royall and kingly &s;tate (which was
great) as to do honour to her highne&s;&s;e to whom we belonged;
<PB N="87" REF="48">
wherein how willingly he imployed him&s;elfe, the &s;equell will
make manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therefore, before his comming, did he &s;end off 3. great
and large Canowes; in each whereof, were certaine of the grea|te&s;t
per&s;onages that were about him, attired all of them in white
Lawne, or cloth of Calecut, hauing ouer their heads, from one
end of the Canow to the other, a couering of thinne and fine
mats, borne vp by a frame made of reedes, vnder which euery
man &s;ate in order according to his dignity; the hoary heads, of
many of them, &s;et forth the greater reuerence due to their per|&s;ons,
and manife&s;tly &s;hewed, that the king v&s;ed the aduice of a
graue and prudent Coun&s;ell, in his affaires. Be&s;ides the&s;e, were
diuer&s;e others, young and comely men, a great number attired
in white as were the other, but with manife&s;t differences: ha|uing
their places al&s;o vnder the &s;ame couering, but in inferior
order, as their calling required.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the men were &s;ouldiers, who &s;tood in comely or|der
round about on both &s;ides; on the out&s;ide of whom, againe
did &s;it the rowers in certaine galleries, which being 3. on each
&s;ide all along&s;t the Canow, did lie off from the &s;ide thereof,
&s;ome 3. or 4. yards, one being orderly builded lower then the
other: in euery of which galleries was an equall number of
banckes, whereon did &s;it the rowers, about the number of foure|&s;coure
in one Canow: In the forepart of each Canow, &s;ate two
men, the one holding a Tabret, the other a piece of bra&s;&s;e,
whereon they both at once &s;troke; and ob&s;eruing a due time
and rea&s;onable &s;pace betweene each &s;troake by the &s;ound there|of,
directed the rowers to keepe their &s;troake with their oares;
as on the contrary, the rowers ending their &s;troake with a &s;ong,
gaue warning to the others to &s;trike againe; and &s;o continued
they their way with maruelous &s;wiftne&s;&s;e: neither were their
Canowes naked or vnfurni&s;hed of warlike munition, they had
each of the~, at lea&s;t one &s;mall ca&s;t piece of about a yard in length
mounted vpon a &s;tocke, which was &s;et vpright; be&s;ides euery
man except the rowers, had his &s;word, dagger, and target, and
<PB N="88" REF="49">
&s;ome of them &s;ome other weapons, as, lances, calliuers, bowes,
arrowes, and many darts.</P>
<P>The&s;e Canowes comming neere our &s;hip in order, rowed
round about vs one after another; and the men as they pa&s;&s;e by
vs, did vs a kinde of homage with great &s;olemnity, the greate&s;t
per&s;onages beginning fir&s;t, with reuerend countenance and be|hauiour,
to bow their bodies euen to the ground: which done,
they put our owne me&s;&s;enger aboard vs againe, and &s;ignified to
vs, that their king (who him&s;elfe was comming) had &s;ent them
before him, to conduct our &s;hip into a better roade, de&s;iring a
hal&s;er to be giuen them forth, that they might employ their
&s;eruice as their king commanded, in towing our &s;hip therewith
to the place a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The king him&s;elfe was not farre behinde, but he al&s;o with 6.
graue and ancient fathers in his Canow approaching, did at
once together with them, yeeld vs a reuerend kinde of obey|&s;ance
in farre more humble manner, then was to be expected;
he was of a tall &s;tature, very corpulent and well &s;et together, of
a very princely and gratious countenance; his re&s;pect among&s;t
his owne was &s;uch, that neither his Viceroy of Mutir aforena|med,
nor any other of his coun&s;ellers, dur&s;t &s;peake vnto him
but vpon their knees, not ri&s;ing againe till they were licenced.</P>
<P>Who&s;e comming as it was to our generall, no &s;mall cau&s;e of
goodliking, &s;o was he receiued in the be&s;t manner we could, an|&s;werable
vnto his &s;tate: our ordinance thundred, which wee
mixed with great &s;tore of &s;mall &s;hot, among which &s;ounding
our trumpets, and other in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, both of &s;till and
loud noi&s;e, where with he was &s;o much delighted, that reque&s;ting
our mu&s;ick to come into the boate, hee ioyned his Canow
to the &s;ame, and was towed at lea&s;t a whole houre together,
with the boate at the &s;terne of our &s;hip: Be&s;ides this, our gene|rall
&s;ent him &s;uch pre&s;ents, as he thought, might both requite
his curte&s;y already receiued, and worke a farther confirmation,
of that goodliking and friend&s;hip already begunne.</P>
<P>The king being thus in mu&s;icall paradi&s;e, and enioying that
<PB N="89" REF="49">
wherewith he was &s;o highly plea&s;ed; his brother named <HI>Moro</HI>
with no le&s;&s;e brauery, then any of the re&s;t, accompanied al&s;o
with a great number of gallant followers, made the like repaire,
and gaue vs like re&s;pect; and his homage done he fell a&s;terne of
vs, till we came to anchor: neither did our generall leaue his
curte&s;ie vnrewarded, but bountifully plea&s;ed him al&s;o before
we parted.</P>
<P>The king as &s;oone as we were come to anchor, craued par|don
to be gone, and &s;o tooke leaue, promi&s;ing vs, that the next
day he would come aboard, and in the meane time would pre|pare
and &s;end &s;uch victualls, as were requi&s;ite and nece&s;&s;ary for
our proui&s;ion.</P>
<P>Accordingly the &s;ame night, and the morrow following, we
receiued what was there to be had, by way of traffique, to wir,
rice in pretty quantity, hennes, &s;ugar canes, imperfect and li|quid
&s;ugar, a fruit which they call <HI>Figo (Magellane</HI> calls it a
figge of a &s;pan long, but is no other then that which the Spani|ards
and Portingalls haue named <HI>Plantanes) Cocoes</HI> and a kind of
meale which they call <HI>Sago,</HI> made of the toppes of certaine
trees, ta&s;ting in the mouth like &s;oure curdes, but meltes away
like &s;ugar; whereof they make a kinde of cake which will keepe
good at lea&s;t 10. yeares; of this la&s;t we made the greate&s;t quan|tity
of our proui&s;ion: for a few cloues wee did al&s;o traffique,
whereof for, a &s;mall matter, wee might haue had greater &s;tore,
then we could well tell where to be&s;tow: but our generalls care
was, that the &s;hip &s;hould not be too much pe&s;tered or annoyed
therewith.</P>
<P>At the time appointed, our generall (hauing &s;et all things in
order to receiue him) looked for the kings returne, who failing
both in time and promi&s;e, &s;ent his brother to make his excu&s;e,
and to intreat our generall to come on &s;hoare; his brother be|ing
the while to remaine aboard, as a pawne for his &s;afe re&s;to|ring:
our generall could willingly haue con&s;ented, if the king
him&s;elf had not fir&s;t broke his word: the con&s;ideration where|of,
bred an vtter di&s;liking in the whole company, who by no
<PB N="90" REF="50">
meanes would giue con&s;ent, he &s;hould hazard him&s;elfe, e&s;peci|ally,
for that the kings brother had vttered certaine words, in
&s;ecret conference with our generall aboard his cabbin, which
bred no &s;mall &s;u&s;pition of ill intent; our generall being thus re|&s;olued
not to goe a&s;hoare at that time, re&s;erued the Viceroy for
a pledge, and &s;o &s;ent certaine of his gentlemen to the court,
both to accompany the kings brother, and al&s;o with &s;peciall
me&s;&s;age to the king him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>They being come &s;omewhat neere vnto the ca&s;tle, were re|ceiued
by another brother of the kings, and certaine others of
the greate&s;t &s;tates, and conducted with great honour towards
the ca&s;tle, where being brought into a large and faire hou&s;e,
they &s;aw gathered together a great multitude of people, by &s;up|po&s;ition
at lea&s;t 1000. the chiefe whereof, were placed round a|bout
the hou&s;e, according as it &s;eemed to their degrees and cal|ling,
the re&s;t remained without.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was in forme foure &s;quare, couered all ouer with
cloth of diuer&s;e colours, not much vnlike our v&s;uall pentadoes
borne vpon a frame of reedes, the &s;ides being open from the
ground&s;ell to the couering, and furni&s;hed with &s;eates round a|bout:
it &s;eemes it was there councell-hou&s;e and not commonly
employed to any other v&s;e.</P>
<P>At the &s;ide of this hou&s;e, next vnto the ca&s;tle was &s;eated the
chaire of &s;tate, hauing directly ouer it, and extending very large|ly
euery way, a very faire and rich canopy, as the ground al&s;o
for &s;ome 10. or 12. pa&s;es compa&s;&s;e, was couered with cloth
of Arras.</P>
<P>While&s;t our gentlemen attended in this place the comming
of the king, which was about the &s;pace of halfe an houre, they
had the better opportunity to ob&s;erue the&s;e things; as al&s;o that
before the kings comming, there were already &s;et three&s;core no|ble
graue and ancient per&s;onages, all of them reported to be of
the kings priuy Councell: at the neather end of the hou&s;e were
placed a great company of yong men, comely per&s;onage and
attire. With out the hou&s;e on the right &s;ide, &s;tood foure ancient
<PB N="91" REF="50">
comely hoare-headed men, cloathed all in red downe to the
ground, but attired on their heads not much vnlike the Turkes;
the&s;e they called Romans, or &s;trangers, who lay as lidgiers there
to keepe continuall traffique with this people: there were al&s;o
two Turkes one Italian as lidgiers: and la&s;t of all one Spaniard,
who being freed by the kings out of the hands of the Portugals,
in the recouering of the Iland, &s;erued him now in &s;tead of a
&s;ouldier.</P>
<P>The king at la&s;t comming from the ca&s;tle, with 8. or 10. more
graue Senators following him, had a very rich canopy (adorned
in the midde&s;t with embo&s;&s;ings of gold) borne ouer him, and
was garded with 12. lances the points turned downeward: our
men (accompanied with <HI>Moro</HI> the kings brother) aro&s;e to meet
him, and he very gratiou&s;ly did welcome and entertaine them.</P>
<P>He was for per&s;on, &s;uch as we haue before de&s;cribed him, of
lowe voice, temperate in &s;peech, of kingly demeanour, and a
Moore by nation. His attire was after the fa&s;hion of the re&s;t of
his countrey, but farre more &s;umptuous, as his condition and
&s;tate required: from the wa&s;t to the ground, was all cloth of
gold, and that very rich; his legges bare, but on his feet a paire
of &s;hooes of cordiuant died red: in the attire of his head, were
finely wreathed in diuer&s;e rings of plated gold, of an inch, or an
inch and halfe in breadth, which made a faire and princely &s;hew,
&s;omewhat re&s;embling a crowne in forme; about his necke hee
had a chaine of perfect gold, the linkes very great and onefold
double; on his left hand was a Diamond, an Emerald, a Ruby,
and a Turky, 4, very faire and perfect jewells, on his right hand
in one ring, a big and perfect Turky, and in another ring many
Diamonds of a &s;maller &s;ize, very artificially &s;et and couched
together.</P>
<P>As thus he &s;ate in his chaire of State, at his right &s;ide there
&s;tood a page with a very co&s;tly fanne (richly embrodered and be|&s;et
with Saphires) breathing &amp; gathering the aire to refre&s;h the
king, the place very hot, both by rea&s;on of the &s;unne, and
the a&s;&s;embly of &s;o great a multitude. After a while our gentle|men
<PB N="92" REF="51">
men hauing deliuered their me&s;&s;age, and receiued an&s;wer, were
licenced to depart, and were &s;afely conducted backe againe, by
one of the chiefe of the kings Councell, who had charge from
the king him&s;elfe to performe the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Our gentlemen ob&s;eruing the ca&s;tle as well as they could,
could not couceiue it to be a place of any great force: two onely
canons they there &s;aw, and tho&s;e at that pre&s;ent vntrauer&s;able
becau&s;e vnmounted. The&s;e with all other furniture of like &s;ort
which they haue, they haue gotten them from the Portingals, by
whom the ca&s;tle it &s;elfe was al&s;o builded, whiles they inhabited
that place and Iland. Who &s;eeking to &s;ettle a tyrannous gouern|ment
(as in other places &s;o) ouer this people, and not conten|ting
them&s;elues with a better e&s;tate then they de&s;erued (except
they might (as they thought) make &s;ure worke by leauing none
of the royall bloud aliue, who &s;hould make challenge to the
kingdome) cruelly murthered the king him&s;elfe (father to him
who now raignes) and intended the like to all his &s;onnes. Which
cauelty in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing, brought &s;uch a &s;haking on their
v&s;urped e&s;tate, that they were faine, without couenanting to car|rie
away goods, munition, or any thing el&s;e to quitte the place
and the whole Iland to &s;aue their liues.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent king with his brethren in reuenge of their fa|thers
murther, &s;o be&s;tirred them&s;elues, that the Portingall was
wholly driuen from that Iland, and glad that he yet keepes foo|ting
in <HI>Tidore.</HI> The&s;e foure yeares this king hath beene increa|&s;ing,
and was (as was affirmed) at that pre&s;ent, Lord of an hun|dred
Ilands thereabout; and was euen now preparing his forces
to hazard a chance with the Portingals for <HI>Tidore</HI> it &s;elfe.</P>
<P>The people are Moores, who&s;e Religion con&s;i&s;ts much in cer|taine
&s;uper&s;titious ob&s;eruations of new Moones, and certaine
&s;ea&s;ons, with a rigid and &s;trickt kind of fa&s;ting. We had experi|ence
hereof in the Viceroy and his retinue, who lay aboard vs all
the time for the mo&s;t part during our abode in this place: who
during their per&s;cribed time, would neither eate not drinke, not
&s;o much as a cup of cold water in the day (&s;o zealous are they
<PB N="93" REF="51">
in their &s;elfe deui&s;ed wor&s;hip) but yet in the night would eate
threetimes, and that very largely. This <HI>Terenate</HI> &s;tands in 27.
min. North latitude.</P>
<P>While we rode at anchor in the harbour at <HI>Terenate,</HI> be&s;ides
the natiues there came aboard vs another, a goodly gentleman,
very well accompanied with his interpreter, to view our &s;hip,
and to conferre with our Generall: he was apparelled much af|ter
our manner, mo&s;t neate and Courtlike: his carriage the mo&s;t
re&s;pectiue, and full of di&s;creet behauiour that euer we had &s;eene;
Hee told vs that he was him&s;elfe but a &s;tranger in tho&s;e Ilands,
being a naturall of the Prouince of <HI>Paghia</HI> in <HI>China;</HI> his name,
<HI>Pau&s;aos</HI> of the familie of <HI>Hombu:</HI> of which familie there had 11.
raigned in continuall &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the&s;e two hundred yeares, and
king <HI>Bonog</HI> by the death of his elder brother (who dyed by a fall
from his hor&s;e) the rightfull heire of all <HI>China,</HI> is the twelfth of
this race: he is of 22. yeares of age: his mother yet liuing: he hath
a wife, and by her &s;onne: he is well beloued, and highly ho|noured
of all his &s;ubjects, and liues in great peace from any feare
of forreine inua&s;ion: but it was not this mans fortune to enioy
his part of this happine&s;&s;e both of his king and countrey, as hee
mo&s;t de&s;ired.</P>
<P>For being accu&s;ed of a capitall crime whereof (through free)
yet he could not euidently make his innocency appeare, and
knowing the peremptory iu&s;tice of <HI>China,</HI> to be irreuocable, if
he &s;hould expect the &s;entence of the Iudges; he before hand
made &s;uite to his king, that it would plea&s;e him to commit his
trial to Gods prouidence and iudgement, and to that end to per|mit
him to trauell on this condition, that if the brought not home
&s;ome worthy intelligence, &s;uch as his Maie&s;tie had neuer had
before, and were mo&s;t fit to be knowne, and mo&s;t honorable for
<HI>China,</HI> he &s;hould for euer liue an exile, or el&s;e dye for daring to
&s;et foot againe in his owne countrey: for he was a&s;&s;ured that the
God of heauen had care of innocency.</P>
<P>The king granted his &s;uite, and now he had beene three yeares
abroad, and at this pre&s;ent came from <HI>Tidore</HI> (where he had re|mained
<PB N="94" REF="52">
two moneths) to &s;ee the Engli&s;h Generall, of whom he
heard &s;uch &s;trange things, and from him (if it plea&s;ed God to
afford it) to learne &s;ome &s;uch intelligence as might make way
for his returne into his countrey: and therefore he earne&s;tly in|treated
our Generall, to make relation to him of the occa&s;ion,
way, and manner of his coming &s;o far from England thither,

<P>Our Generall gaue ample &s;atisfaction to each part of his re|que&s;t:
the &s;tranger hearkened with great attention and delight
to his di&s;cour&s;e, and as he naturally excelled in memory (be|&s;ides
his helpe of art to better the &s;ame) &s;o he firmely printed it
in his mind, and with great reuerence thanked God, who had &s;o
vnexpectedly brought him, to the notice of &s;uch admirable
things. Then fell he to intreate our Generall with many mo&s;t
earne&s;t and vehement per&s;ua&s;ions, that be would be content to
&s;ee his countrey before his departure any farther We&s;tward, that
it &s;hould be a mo&s;t plea&s;ant, mo&s;t honourable, and mo&s;t profi|table
thing for him that he &s;hould gaine hereby the notice, and
carrie home the de&s;cription of one of the mo&s;t ancient, migh|tie&s;t
and riche&s;t kingdomes in the world. Hereupon he tooke oc|ca&s;ion
to relate the number and greatne&s;&s;e of the Prouinces, with
the rare commodities and good things they yeelded: the num|ber,
&s;tateline&s;&s;e, and riches of their Cities, with what abundance
of men, victuals, munition, and all manner of nece&s;&s;aries and
delightfull things they were &s;tored with: In particular, touching
ordnance and great gunnes (the late inuention of a &s;cab-&s;hind
F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">er among&s;t vs in Europe) he related that in <HI>Suntien</HI> (by &s;ome
called <HI>Quinzai</HI>) which is the chiefe&s;t Citie of all <HI>China,</HI> they had
bra&s;&s;e ordnance of all &s;orts (much ea&s;ier to be trauer&s;ed then
ours were, and &s;o perfectly made that they would hit a &s;hillng)
aboue 2000. yeares agoe. With many other worthy things
which our Generals owne experience (if it would plea&s;e him to
make triall) would (better then his relation) a&s;&s;ure him of. The
brize would &s;hortly &s;erue very fitly to carrie him thither, and he
<PB N="95" REF="52">
him&s;elfe would accompanie him all the way. He accounted
him&s;elfe a happie man, that he had but &s;eene and &s;poken with vs;
the relation of it might perhaps &s;erue him to recouer fauour in
his countrey: but if he could preuaile with our Generall him|&s;elfe
to go thither, he doubted not but it would be a meanes of
his great aduancement, and increa&s;e of honour with his king:
Notwith&s;tanding our Generall could not on &s;uch per&s;wa&s;ions
be induced, and to the &s;tranger parted &s;orrie, that he could not
preuaile in his reque&s;t, yet exceeding glad of the intelligence he

in need of, but onely water which wee were faine to fetch from
another Iland &s;omewhat farther to the South) made our abode
herefor 26. whole dayes together.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we did, we pitched our tents and intrenched

are nor much vnlike our broomes in England: Among the&s;e

as if euery twigge on euery tree had beene a lighted candle: or
as if that place had beene the &s;tarry &s;pheare. To the&s;e wee may
adde the relation of another almo&s;t as &s;trange a creature, which
here we &s;aw, and that was an innumerable multitude of huge
Bats or reare-mice, equalling or rather exceeding a good Henne
in bigne&s;&s;e. They flie with maruellous &s;wiftne&s;&s;e, but their flight
is very &s;hort; and when they light, they hang onely by the

pre&s;enting it &s;elfe to our mindes, but the gha&s;tly appearance of
in&s;tant death, affording no re&s;pit or time of pau&s;ing, called vp|on
vs to turne our thoughts another way, to renounce the
world to deny our &s;elues, and to commend our &s;elues into the
mercifull hands of our mo&s;t gratious God: to this purpo&s;e wee
pre&s;ently fell pro&s;trate, and with ioyned prayers &s;ent vp vnto the

the e&s;pecialle&s;t care of the better part, to wit, the &s;oule, and ad|ding

our &s;elues, &s;hewing vs the way thereto by his owne example;
and fir&s;t of all the pump being well plyed, and the &s;hip freed of
water, we found our leaks to be nothing increa&s;ed, which
thought it gaue vs no hope of deliuerance, yet it gaue vs &s;ome
hope of re&s;pit, in&s;omuch, as it a&s;&s;ured vs that the bulke was
&s;ound, which truly we acknowledged to be an immediate proui|dence

whereas at fir&s;t wee could looke for nothing but a pre&s;ent end,
that expectation was now turned, into the awaiting for a
lingring death, of the two, the farre more fearefull to be cho&s;en:
one thing fell out happily for vs, that the mo&s;t of our men did
not conceiue this thing, which had they done, they would in all

cheerfull &s;peeches, and good incouragements vnto the re&s;t.</P>
<P>For whiles it &s;eemed to be a cleere ca&s;e, that our &s;hip was &s;o
fa&s;t moared, that &s;hee could not &s;tirr; it nece&s;&s;ary followed,
that either we were there to remaine on the place with her; or

<P>As touching our &s;hip, this was the comfort that &s;hee could
giue vs, that &s;hee her &s;elfe lying there confined already vpon
the hard and pinching rocks, did tell vs plaine, that &s;hee conti|nually
expected her &s;peedy di&s;patch, as &s;oone as the &s;ea and

bea&s;tes, as a bird on the mountaines without all comfort, or a|mong
the barbarous people of the heathen, in intollerable
bondage both of body and minde.</P>
<P>And put the ca&s;e that her day of de&s;truction &s;hould be defer|red,
longer then either rea&s;on could per&s;wade vs, or in any like|lihood

any one to be perceiued.</P>
<P>And whither (had we departed from her) &s;hould we haue re|ceiued
any comfort; nay the very impo&s;&s;ibility of going, ap|peared
to be no le&s;&s;e, then tho&s;e other before mentioned: our
boate was by no meanes able at once, to carry aboue 20. per&s;ons
with any &s;afety, and we were 58. in all, the neere&s;t land was &s;ix
leagues from vs, and the winde from the &s;hoare directly bent a|gain&s;t
vs: or &s;hould we haue thought of &s;etting &s;ome a&s;hoare,
and after that to haue fetched the re&s;t, there being no place
thereabout without inhabitants, the fir&s;t that had landed mu&s;t
fir&s;t haue fallen into the hand of the enemie, and &s;o the re&s;t in
order, and though perhaps we might e&s;cape the &s;word, yet
<PB N="101" REF="55">
would our life haue beene wor&s;e then death, not alone in re&s;pect
of our wofull captiuity, and bodily mif&s;eries, but mo&s;t of all in
re&s;pectt of our Chri&s;tian liberty, being to be depriued of all pub|lique
meanes of &s;eruing the true God, and continually grieued
with the horrible impieties and diuelli&s;h idolatries of the hea|then.</P>
<P>Our mi&s;erie beeing thus manife&s;t, the very con&s;ideration
wherof mu&s;t needs haue &s;haken fle&s;h and bloud, if faith in Gods
promi&s;es had not mightily &s;u&s;tained vs, we pa&s;t the night with
earne&s;t longings that the day would once appeare, the meane
time we &s;pent in often prayers, and other godly exerci&s;es, there|by
comforting our &s;elues; and refre&s;hing our hearts, &s;triuing to
bring our &s;elues to an humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion vnder the hand of
God, and to a referring our &s;elues wholly to his good will and
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The day therefore at length appearing, and it being almo&s;t
full &s;ea about that time, after we had giuen thankes to God for
his forbearing of vs hitherto, and had with teares called vpon
him to ble&s;&s;e our labours; we againe renewed our trauell, to &s;ee
if we could now po&s;&s;ibly find any anchor-hold, which we had
formerly &s;ought in vaine. But this &s;econd attempt proued as
fruitle&s;&s;e as the former, and left vs nothing to tru&s;t to, but pray|ers
and teares, &s;eeing it appeared impo&s;&s;ible that euer the fore|ca&s;t
coun&s;ell, pollicie, or power of man could euer effect the de|liuery
of our &s;hip, except the Lord onely miraculou&s;ly &s;hould
do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It was therefore pre&s;ently motioned, and by generall voice
determined to commend our ca&s;e to God alone, leauing our
&s;elues wholly in his hand; to &s;pill or &s;aue vs as &s;eeme be&s;t to his
gracious wi&s;edome. And that our faith might bee the better
&s;trengthened, and the comfortable apprehen&s;ion of Gods mer|cie
in Chri&s;t, be more clearely felt; we had a Sermon and the
Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour celebrated.</P>
<P>After this &s;weet repa&s;t was thus receiued, and other holy ex|erci&s;es
adioyned were ended, le&s;t we &s;hould &s;eeme guilty in any

re&s;pect for not v&s;ing all lawfull meanes we could inuent; we fell

&s;hip by ca&s;ting &s;ome of her goods into the &s;ea: which thing as it
was attempted mo&s;t willingly, &s;o was it di&s;patched in very &s;hort
time. So that euen tho&s;e things which we before this time, nor
any other in our ca&s;e could be without, did now &s;eeme as things
onely worthy to be de&s;pi&s;ed, yea we were herein &s;o forward,
that neither our munition for defence, nor the very meale for
&s;u&s;tentation of our liues could find fauour with vs, but euerie
thing as it fir&s;t came to hand went ouerboard a&s;&s;uring our &s;elues
of this, that if it plea&s;ed God once to deliuer vs out of that mo&s;t
de&s;perate &s;trait wherein we were, he would fight for vs again&s;t
our enemies, neither would he &s;uffer vs to peri&s;h for want of
bread. But when all was done, it was not any of our endeuours,
but Gods onely hand that wrought our deliuerie; twas he alone
that brought vs euen vnder the very &s;troake of death; twas he a|lone
that &s;aid vnto vs, Returne againe ye &s;onnes of men; twas he
alone that &s;et vs at liberty againe, that made vs &s;afe and free, after
that we had remained in the former mi&s;erable condition, the
full &s;pace of twentie houres, to his glorious name be the euer|la&s;ting
prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The manner of our deliuery (for the relation of it will e&s;pe|cially
be expected) was onely this. The place whereon we &s;ate
&s;o fa&s;t, was a firme rocke in a cleft, whereof it was we &s;tucke on
the larbord &s;ide' at low water there was not aboue &s;ixe foote
depth in all on the &s;tarbord, within little di&s;tance as you haue
heard no bottome to be found, the brize during the whole
time that we thus were &s;tayed, blew &s;omewhat &s;tiffe directly
again&s;t out broad &s;ide, and &s;o perforce kept the &s;hip vpright: It
plea&s;ed God in the beginning of the tyde, while the water was
yet almo&s;t at lowe&s;t, to &s;lacke the &s;tiffene&s;&s;e of the wind; and
now out &s;hip who required thirteene foot water to make her
fleet, and had not at that time on the one &s;ide aboue &s;euen at

alreadie kept her vp, fell a heeling towards the deepe water, and
<PB N="103" REF="56">
by that meanes freed her keele and made vs glad men.</P>
<P>This &s;hoale is at lea&s;t three or foure leagues in length, it lies
in 2. deg. lacking three or foure minutes South latitude. The
day of this deliuerance was the tenth of Ianuary.<MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="Ian."></P>
<P>Of all the dangers that in our whole voyage we met with, this
was the greate&s;t, but it was not the la&s;t as may appeare by what
