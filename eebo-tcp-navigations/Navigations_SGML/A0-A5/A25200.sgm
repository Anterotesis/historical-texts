<P>_WHen I Con&s;ider what you are by Place, and then Con&s;ider what you are by Grace, it makes me &s;tand Amaz'd: To &s;ee a Man who&s;e Education &s;prings from Noi&s;e and Tumults, Wounds and Slaughters, Religious, Upon Grounds of holy Cir|cum&s;tance:</P>
<P>To &s;ee A Man who&s;e Dealing is in Blood and Waves, becalm'd with Pious Thoughts for Churches good:</P>
<P>To &s;ee A Man that fears not Devils if he meets them in a Fleet at Sea; To lay his Roughne&s;s by, and meekly fall upon his Knees, to Invocate his GOD for King and Kingdoms good; Be&s;peaks Religion in the Soul of War.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>This is a Le&s;son you have Learn'd and Practic'd long, That none with Courage brave can &s;erve his King, without he first with Pious Care Obey his God.</P>
<P>Can he be fit to Fight and Die, that knowes his wicked life is &s;uch, that when he leaves this World he must to Hell.</P>
<P>The Christian Cau&s;e though e're &s;o good mu&s;t &s;ink, if Christians Lives be bad. Can he be trusted to &s;ubdue a Foe, that cannot &s;ubdue his Sin; and quarrel &s;trength, that is a Slave and Captive to his Lu&s;t?</P>
<P>Sir, Your Life proclaims you Chri&s;tian, and your Courage Man: And where I &s;ee the&s;e meet in one, I may be bold to dedicate a Piece for Churches good to &s;uch a Man, without a Frown or Scorn.</P>
<P>It was your Pious Faithful Care this Sermon &s;hould be Preached; and &s;o it was your Zealous Care to Acquaint His Majestie with what was done, that &s;o it might be made Publick: And now I hope your Wi&s;hes will &s;ucceed, that Heaven may be Honour'd more, and Christians Bet|ter'd &s;till, when e're it comes abroad, &s;hall be the Prayers of him who with his Soul doth Love the King and Churche's Peace.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Matth. Chap. XXII. Ver&s;. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<Q>And when the King came in to &s;ee his Gue&s;ts, he &s;aw there a man which had not on a Wedding Garment.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_DEarly beloved in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the&s;e words that I have read unto you, are part of the <HI>Parable</HI> that our Saviour delivered concerning a King, who Marrying his Son, invited divers Gue&s;ts unto the Wedding.</P>
<P>The King who invited the Gue&s;ts, is the In|finite, and Eternal God above; King of all Kings, Lord of all Lords, who hath Power and Mighti|ne&s;s
<PB N="2" REF="4">in him&s;elf to do what he plea&s;eth in Heaven, in Earth, and in Hell, the bottomle&s;s Pit of Eter|nal Vengeance beneath.</P>
<P>He is a King in Heaven by his Grandeur and Maje&s;tie; in the World by his Grace, tender Love and Goodne&s;s; in Hell among the Damned, by his Ju&s;tice and Severity.</P>
<P>Now the Bridegroom is his Ble&s;&s;ed Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by Eternal generation the Lord and Sa|viour of us all.</P>
<P>The Bride that he Marrieth his Son to, is his Pure, Spotle&s;s, Holy Catholick Church.</P>
<P>The time of the Marriage was at Chri&s;t's Incar|nation, when the Divinity and the Humanity were United: for as we ob&s;erve, the be&s;t way to reconcile two Di&s;agreeing Families, is to make &s;ome Marriage between them; Even &s;o the Word became Fle&s;h and dwelt among&s;t us in the World, that he might hereby make our Peace, Reconci|ling God to Man, and Man to God.</P>
<P>The Banquet the Gue&s;ts were invited to, was no Ordinary Entertainment, but Wonderful, the Precious Blood of the Lamb of God (&s;lain from the Beginning of the World) preached in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Word, and pre&s;ented in his holy Sacraments; the next was Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, Everla&s;ting Life, Peace of Con&s;cience, Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; oh
<PB N="3" REF="4">Admirable! Oh Sacred! oh Comfortable Fea&s;t for poor Mi&s;erable Sinners to be invited to.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons appointed to invite the Gue&s;ts, were the Holy Patriarchs and Prophets in old time;</P>
<P>The Ble&s;&s;ed Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles in Chri&s;t's time;</P>
<P>The Divine Pa&s;tors and Preachers in our time; The&s;e are Me&s;&s;engers of the great God, who have done, and &s;till invite poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed penitent Sinners, that are in the high-way to de&s;truction, to Come and Sup with him.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons more particular that are Invi|ted, are both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles:</HI> for although the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;pecially called, (the&s;e glad Ty|dings coming fir&s;t unto them, as being the Se|lect Peculiar People of God;) yet when they re|fu&s;ed and rejected the &s;ame, one going to &s;ee his Farm, and another to try his Oxen; a third having married a Wife, and &s;o could not come; God upon their Rude and Di&s;-ingenuous refu|&s;al rejects them, and &s;ends and invites the <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <HI>I&s;rael; Go into the High-wayes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And when the&s;e, who were invited, were
<PB N="4" REF="5">come, there was one intruding Gue&s;t found at the Table without a Wedding Garment.</P>
<P><HI>And when the King came in to &s;ee his Guests, he &s;aw there a man which had not on a Wedding Garment.</HI></P>
<P>Now the&s;e words will allow us the&s;e two Parts:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Author of the man's di&s;covery; and that was the King: <HI>When the King came in,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Fault he is Charged with, is want of a Wedding Garment.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Author of the man's di&s;covery, and that was the King. We read but of one among &s;o many that was without this Wedding Gar|ment; the Me&s;&s;engers let him pa&s;s for currant, but when the King came in, he makes a &s;econd Survey and Scrutiny, and finds out this one, who had not on his Wedding Garment; he di&s;covers this Unworthy Gue&s;t, which the Me&s;&s;engers could find no fault with; <HI>Friend, how camest thou in hither?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Beloved,</HI> &s;o true it is, that our Eternal God that dwelleth in Light, that no man can ap|proach,
<PB N="5" REF="5">&s;ees not as man &s;ees. We read in the 1^&s;^t^. of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> and 14 <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> that the Eyes of the Lord are <HI>like a flame of fire;</HI> they &s;earch into the &s;ecret Apartments of the Heart; not a Corner nor part, but the Lord &s;ees and di&s;co|vers it.</P>
<P>But, alas! poor &s;hort-&s;ighted man reacheth no further than the outward appearance; if that be regular and &s;mooth to the eye, his &s;earch is at an end, he hath di&s;covered as much as he can; but the Eyes of God go down deeper in|to the very Soul, and fathom the Bottom of the Reins, View and Di&s;cover how all &s;tands there. We read in 1 <HI>Sam. Chap.</HI> 16. <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 7. that the Lord Commanded <HI>Samuel</HI> not to look on his Countenance, nor on the height of his Stature: <HI>for the Lord &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</HI> We may deceive men with our Coun|tenance, our Grave Ge&s;ture, Pageantry and Shews; but the&s;e can't deceive God, or put a trick upon the Almighty.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us in the 4th of the <HI>Hebrewes,</HI> 13 <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> that <HI>all things are open and naked to the Eyes of him we have to do with;</HI> That is, God hath a full pro&s;pect upon all Men and Women in the World, let them creep under what Mask,
<PB N="6" REF="6">Di&s;guize, Canopie of Secrecy they will: Thou may'&s;t lye, di&s;&s;emble, and cozen &s;o clo&s;ely and cunningly, that no Man nor Angel can detect thee; thou may'&s;t commit Adultery in the dark, and no man privy to it; Thou may'&s;t &s;teal when no Eye &s;ees thee: Thou may'&s;t have Trea&s;on in thy Soul, Rebellion in thy Heart, and yet thy outward &s;eeming Conformity may Screen this from Man. Thou may'&s;t with <HI>Judas</HI> eat of the Sop, drink of the Cup, receive the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, &s;wallow the Oaths of <HI>Alle|giance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy;</HI> do all what the Law re|quires, and yet thou may'&s;t have corrupt Po|pi&s;h Re&s;ervations in thy heart to betray thy Ma&s;ter: But all this while remember that thou &s;tande&s;t Naked before the All-&s;earching Eye of an Omnipre&s;ent God, who knowes what thou art, and &s;ees what thou do'&s;t intend. <HI>Totus Auris,</HI> &amp;c, &s;aith St. <HI>Ciril,</HI> &amp;c. God he is all an Ear, all an Eye, all an Hand; He hears all, he &s;ees all, and hath a hand that can reach all where ever we be: God Almighty the Search|er of all hearts takes up his &s;tanding at the door of our Souls, and with his Curious All-&s;eeing Eye views all our actions and re&s;olutions how &s;ecret &s;oever.</P>
<P>Holy <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, That God looks down
<PB N="7" REF="6">from Heaven, and beholds all the Sons of men; as well tho&s;e in the deepe&s;t darkne&s;s, as tho&s;e in the brighte&s;t light; <HI>Whither</HI> (&s;aith <HI>David</HI>) <HI>can we flie from thy pre&s;ence? if we take the wings of the Morning and flie to the uttermost parts of the Earth, thou art there; if we go up to Heaven, thou art there; if I go down into the thick &s;moak of Hell, thou art there.</HI> Is it not a madne&s;s then to &s;ay, when thou art a going about wickedne&s;s, peradven|ture the Night &s;hall hide me; when the day and the Night are both alike to God?</P>
<P>God &s;ees thee when thou goe&s;t out early in the Morning; God &s;ees thee when thou come&s;t home in the Evening late. God &s;ees thee when the Candle burns; God &s;ees thee when the Candle is out. God &s;ees thee when thou Con|ver&s;e&s;t with thy heart, and &s;itte&s;t in Council with thy thoughts: What can we do but God &s;ees it; and whither can we go, but God will di&s;cover us?</P>
<P>And though this Doctrine be as true as God is true, yet is it not &s;trange, and full of A&s;toni&s;h|ing wonder, to &s;ee how <HI>Adam,</HI> and all the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> labour to hide them&s;elves and their &s;ins from God?</P>
<P><HI>Adam,</HI> after his great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Eden,</HI> hid him&s;elf behind the Bu&s;hes, and Trees of the
<PB N="8" REF="7">Garden, as if they could have &s;ecur'd him from the All-&s;eeing Eye of his Maker; but he was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of his folly: for God in the Cool of the Evening came to the very Bu&s;h where he lay, <HI>Adam, where art thou?</HI> Alas poor wretch! nothing could hide thee from the Di&s;covery of thy God.</P>
<P>And did not <HI>Cain, Adam</HI>'s Son, tread in the foot&s;teps of his Father? for when he had Inhu|manely Murdered his poor Innocent Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> how did he labour to cover the blood with the du&s;t of the Ground, to hide and con|ceal his wickedne&s;s! For then God called from Heaven, <HI>VVhere is thy Brother Abel?</HI> how Moro&s;e and Angry doth he an&s;wer God, as if he knew nothing of it? <HI>Am I my Brother's Keeper?</HI> Yet this would not do: God &s;aw it when no Eye el&s;e &s;aw it, and puni&s;hed him &s;oundly for it. <HI>Sarah</HI> thought none did &s;ee her laugh, when &s;he &s;eem'd to mi&s;tru&s;t God's promi&s;ing her a Son; yet God &s;aw it, though as the Holy Text &s;aith, <HI>She only laughed within her &s;elf. God</HI> &s;aw <HI>Zeeb</HI> behind the Wine-Pre&s;s. <HI>God</HI> &s;aw <HI>Saul</HI> when he hid him&s;elf under the Stuff. Who would ever have thought that the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Garment, the 200 &s;hekels of Silver and 50 &s;hekels of Gold that <HI>Achan</HI> conveyed away, would ever have
<PB N="9" REF="7">been di&s;covered? No Eye &s;aw him when he brought them out of the Camp, he Intombed them under his own Tent, all &s;afe and &s;ecure as he thought; and yet <HI>God</HI> di&s;covers this fact of his and layes it open to all <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> How did God openly manife&s;t and di&s;play the Abominable Idolatry of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> together with their Idols and Images, when they had got them|&s;elves between two Walls from all appearance of &s;ight? and yet &s;ee how God brings the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> to the very Entring-place of the Door that led into the Chamber of their Imagery; <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> Chap. 8. Ver&s;e 8, 9, 10. <HI>Then &s;aid he unto me, Son of Man, digg now in the wall; and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a Door. And he &s;aid unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked Abominations that they do here. So I went in, and &s;aw, and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the Idols of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael pourtrayed upon the wall round about.</HI></P>
<P>The Devilli&s;h Plotting Powder-Traytors met together in the Vault, they thought them|&s;elves &s;ecure; &s;hadowed from the eye of No|tice, and fenced from the hand of Ju&s;tice: But as Dark as the Vault was, and as Clo&s;e as they went to work, the <HI>All-&s;eeing God</HI> de&s;cry'd their Abomination, and de&s;troy'd them, and their ha|bitation.
<PB N="10" REF="8">The Ob&s;curity of their Cell, Thick|ne&s;s of Walls, Clo&s;ene&s;s of Windows, with the Cloak of a holy Catholick Profe&s;&s;ion, thrown over all this, could not make their Notorious Wickedne&s;s Dark to the Eye of Heaven.</P>
<P>Little did this late Brood of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Villains ever think, that their horrid Intended Trea&s;on to Butcher the King, and Subvert the whole Kingdom, &s;hould have been &s;o manife&s;ted, and laid open, as, ble&s;&s;ed be our Gratious <HI>God,</HI> it is at this day.</P>
<P>How long was the Pope, the Cardinals, the Je&s;uits, the Monks, the Friers, Hatching this Bloody Mi&s;chief; and ju&s;t when they thought to have brought forth their Inhumane De&s;ign, that <HI>God,</HI> that View'd all their Meetings, &s;aw all their Doings, read all their Letters, Par|dons, Bulls, Commi&s;&s;ions; Cru&s;ht the Cocka|trice in the &s;hell: If <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> who was but a man, could e&s;py all the De&s;ign and Contrivan|ces of the <HI>A&s;syrian</HI> King, which he concluded of in his &s;ecret Chamber; what then can e&s;cape the Eye, the Ear, the Knowledg of the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Eli&s;ha?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>U&s;e</HI> that I will make of this Point, &s;hall be that of Saint <HI>Ber. de conver&s;. ad Cler. C.</HI> 16. <HI>Caut&egrave; Ambula, Te Videt Angelus Malus, videt te Bonus,
<PB N="11" REF="8">videt &amp; Bonis &amp; Malis Major Angelis, Deus:</HI> Our Impieties are not without witne&s;s; the good Angels and the bad Angels, and he that's bet|ter than the Angels, far above all Principali|ties, even the great God of Heaven and Earth &s;ees us, <HI>caut&egrave; igitur ambula.</HI> It behoveth us there|fore to walk Circum&s;pectly and Sincerely; for though we may &s;eem for a time to hide our &s;elves and our &s;ins from God, yet at length God will find us out, as he did <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>Eden, Cain</HI> in the Field, <HI>Zeeb</HI> behind the Wine-Pre&s;s, <HI>David</HI>'s Adultery and Murder, the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> Idolatry; as he did the Powder-Traitors; as he did the Horrid Popi&s;h Trea&s;on of late; as he did this Unworthy Gue&s;t in my Text.</P>
<P>It was good Coun&s;el that one of the Rabins gave unto his Scholar, <HI>Remember Three Things and thou &s;halt never do ami&s;s.</HI> 1. <HI>That there is about thee a &s;eeing Eye.</HI> 2. <HI>A hearing Ear.</HI> 3. <HI>A Book, wherein all thy works, words and thoughts are Regi|&s;tred.</HI> Now did we really and weightily con|&s;ider this, That <HI>God</HI> &s;aw us, that <HI>God</HI> heard us, and that <HI>God</HI> Regi&s;tred all that we do, and will one day bring us to an accompt for it; Cer|tainly, there would not be &s;o much private Murder, &s;o much private Adultery, &s;o much private Trea&s;on again&s;t the King, &s;o much Hy|pocricy,
<PB N="12" REF="9">&s;o much &s;elf-Intere&s;t, &s;o much Deceit, &s;o much Couzenage acted as there is. Did we believe that <HI>God</HI> heard all our Words, &s;aw all our Works and Doings, we &s;hould not dare to Affront <HI>God</HI> &s;o openly, nor Commit tho&s;e fre|quent Abominations in the Dark as we do.</P>
<P>No man will be &s;o Impudent as to &s;teal in the face of the Judge; no man will be &s;o No|torious as to be drunk, or Commit Adultery in the Eye of his Prince; and yet how often do men &s;teal and are drunk and commit filthine&s;s in the Eyes of the Judge of all Men, and the King of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>A man that is truly per&s;uaded <HI>God</HI> &s;ees him, he will take heed what he doth, and that <HI>God</HI> hears him, he will temper his Tongue with Di&s;cretion; And that <HI>God</HI> &s;earcheth every Cor|ner of his heart, he will be very mindful of what he meditates and thinks on. A man who is per&s;uaded that <HI>God</HI> beholds all his Dealings in the World, he will take heed how he Bor|rowes, how he Lends, how he Buyes, how he Sells, how he Wrongs his Neighbour either in his Name, or in his Goods, or in his Life: Be per&s;uaded then to live as tho&s;e that have al|wayes <HI>God</HI> before them.</P>
<P>And now to &s;tir you up yet further to this
<PB N="13" REF="9">holy Duty of Sincere, Holy, and Hone&s;t Walk|ing, as in the Pre&s;ence of the All-&s;eeing <HI>God,</HI> take the&s;e Two or Three Motives and Inducements following.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Con&s;ider, That that <HI>God</HI> that made thee, that feeds thee, cloathes thee, pre&s;erves thee, gives thee Health and Peace, and by his Mercy has kept thee out of Hell; This very <HI>God</HI> Com|mands thee to walk before him in all hone&s;ty, and godline&s;s of life. We read in the 17. <HI>Gen. Ver&s;.</HI> 1. That the Lord Commanded <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>walk before</HI> him, <HI>and be upright;</HI> And in <HI>Abraham,</HI> he Commands all the Children of the &s;ame Faith to walk before him, and be upright. Remember this, if thou woulde&s;t be a Saint in Glory as <HI>Abraham,</HI> thou mu&s;t obey the Com|mand of thy Maker, walking &s;incerely and ho|lily upon Earth, as <HI>Abraham</HI> did. A good Sub|ject will obey the Commands of his King, and a good Chri&s;tian the Commands of his <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As it is the Command of <HI>God,</HI> That thou &s;hould'&s;t walk holily as in his pre&s;ence, &s;o we have the Example of <HI>God</HI>'s Servants who are Renowned for the Obedience of his Com|mandment. Holy <HI>Enoch walked with God,</HI> that is, he looked upon God as who &s;aw his Thoughts, Cogitations, Actions; heard all his
<PB N="14" REF="10">words, and his life was an&s;werable to &s;uch a pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>How Holy, how Pious, how Religious, how Obedient was <HI>Abraham</HI> in Walking before God? how Exact was holy <HI>David</HI> in this way? for fear of doing ill he placed the Lord alwaies be|fore him. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 116.9. <HI>I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the Living.</HI> Let the Command therefore of God, and the Example of his holy Saints, urge thee to keep God alwaies before thee.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As we have the Command of God, the Example of the Saints for our walking as in God's Pre&s;ence; &s;o he that walks as in the pre|&s;ence of God, it will certainly bring him to make a Con&s;cienee of all Sin. When <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was allured by his Impudent Mi&s;tre&s;s to commit filthine&s;s, he made her this an&s;wer, <HI>How &s;hall I commit this Great Wickedne&s;s, and &s;in against God?</HI> The bridle that re&s;train'd <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> was the fear of God, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he walked. If men walked as in the pre&s;ence of God, when Lu&s;t, when Covetou&s;ne&s;s, when Pride, when Drun|kenne&s;s, when Revenge, when Trea&s;on doth tempt and allure them, they would an&s;wer, We dare not meddle with you, for that God that's in Heaven &s;ees us; that God that's in Heaven hears
<PB N="15" REF="10">us, we dare not <HI>do this Wickedne&s;s and &s;in against God.</HI> Had the man in my Text propounded this to him&s;elf, he would never have Intruded as he did to his Eternal Damnation. Many don't care how they appear before <HI>God,</HI> &s;o Man don't think ami&s;s of them. Alas! what is it to &s;eem good and hone&s;t before men, but in <HI>God</HI>'s E&s;teem be a Wicked Hypocritical Reprobate?</P>
<P>This Unworthy Gue&s;t in my Text made as fair, as hone&s;t, and as Religious a &s;hew as the re&s;t; and yet you &s;ee he was Condemned as an Unworthy Gue&s;t, and thrown into outer dark|ne&s;s. Let this then be alwaies in thy thoughts, That <HI>God</HI> &s;ees thy Soul, however outwardly fair thou do'&s;t appear to Man.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">

<P>THe Fault the man is here charged with, is the want of a Wedding Garment; where we may Note, <HI>That it is not enough to pre&s;ent our Souls, our Bodies before the All-&s;eeing Eye of God, un|le&s;s we come prepared as we ought.</HI></P>
<P>The man here in my Text not being prepa|red when he came to the Fea&s;t, was Ca&s;t into Hell.</P>
<P>It is &s;omething indeed to come into the Con|gregation
<PB N="16" REF="11">to hear the Word Preached, to re|ceive the Sacrament, to bow our &s;elves before Almighty <HI>God</HI> in Prayer; But let me tell you, the&s;e are not enough; for if we re&s;t here, the&s;e will be but as fuel to add fire to our further Condemnation.</P>
<P><HI>Judas</HI> Repaired into Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence, but being not prepared, he was Condemn'd as the Son of Perdition; he eat at the Lord's Table as well as the re&s;t, but as the Sop went down, the Devil went after it; which was a dear Sa|crament to him, To Eat and Drink his own Damnation: for want of Inward Sincerity, an hone&s;t an &s;ound heart, he was Eternally Damn'd.</P>
<P><HI>All our Fathers,</HI> &s;aith St. <HI>Paul, were under the Cloud,</HI> that is, they had the &s;ame Sacrament, in effect, with us, though not in &s;ub&s;tance; and yet how many of them did God overthrow in the Wilderne&s;s?</P>
<P>From whence we will Note, <HI>That outward Privileges and Claims to God, without Inward San|ctification and Holine&s;s, profit nothing.</HI></P>
<P>The Fooli&s;h Virgins had oyl in their Lamps, but none in their Ve&s;&s;els; they had outward Profe&s;&s;ion, but wanted inward Sincerity; they wanted a &s;upply from within; they had not
<PB N="17" REF="11">Inward Grace, as well as outward Shew.</P>
<P>There were many that lived with Chri&s;t in the Fle&s;h, that did not eat and drink with him; they Prophecy'd in his Name, and in his Name did ca&s;t out Devils, and did many Wonders, and yet Chri&s;t profe&s;&s;eth he knows them not. There mu&s;t be Inward Holine&s;s and Sincerity, as well as outward Shew, or el&s;e it comes to nothing.</P>
<P>Here then we &s;ee, that the Collu&s;ion of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is blown away with the &s;ound of this Doctrine: for the Men of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ay, <HI>That outward works are available to Salvation, though there be no Inward Conformity.</HI> When as we &s;ee this Unworthy Gue&s;t made as Glorious a &s;hew to the eyes of the World, as the re&s;t at the Table; and yet was rejected by him that was the Searcher of Souls.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> &s;ay, <HI>The very receiving the Bread only</HI> (for the Prie&s;t drinks the Wine) <HI>doth remit &s;ins, confer Grace, and gives us a &s;ure Title to the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> Contrary to the Doctrine of my Text, and that of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who pro|nounceth the Unworthy Receiver Guilty of the Body and Blood of Je&s;us. We &s;ee then, let the <HI>Romanists</HI> &s;ay what they will, 'tis as much as our Souls are worth, to come into the pre&s;ence of God to eat and drink at his Table Unprepa|red;
<PB N="18" REF="12">you know what became of this Unworthy Gue&s;t in the Text.</P>
<P>Should God make a &s;trict &s;earch among us, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, can you think he would find but one Unworthy Gue&s;t, but one Unworthy Officer among us? I can charge none of you with Unworthine&s;s, but out of a tender regard to your Eternal good.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, as you value the Blood of Chri&s;t &s;hed for you, and the Salvation of your own Immortal Souls, every man of you that is invited to this Ble&s;&s;ed Fea&s;t of the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, &s;trictly to Examin him&s;elf, before he Eats of this Bread, or Drinks of this Cup.</P>
<P>And now to prevent the Danger which the want of this Wedding Garment may bring up|on us:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I will &s;hew you, what this Wedding Garment is.</P>
<P>Secondly, The means how you may obtain it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, How we mu&s;t u&s;e it when we have obtain'd it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, What this <HI>Wedding Garment</HI> is; There is great difference among the Fathers, what this <HI>Wedding Garment</HI> is, <HI>One</HI> &s;aith it is the New Man.
<PB N="19" REF="12"><HI>Another,</HI> the ob&s;erving the Commandements of Chri&s;t. <HI>Another,</HI> a Pure Conver&s;ation. <HI>Ano|ther,</HI> an Upright Heart. <HI>Another,</HI> Regeneration, con&s;i&s;ting in Faith and Repentance. <HI>Another,</HI> Faith. <HI>Another,</HI> Charity. <HI>Another,</HI> good Works. <HI>Another,</HI> Humility.</P>
<P>But (St.) <HI>Origen</HI> &s;aith, it is Chri&s;t, and &s;o un|doubtedly it is; becau&s;e whoever will come unto God, or partake of any My&s;tery of Salva|tion, mu&s;t be Cloathed with Chri&s;t as a Gar|ment, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. <HI>Who is made unto us</HI> the Faith|ful, <HI>Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Re|demption.</HI> Chri&s;t, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, covers all his as with a Garment. We &s;ee plain enough that there are &s;pots in the Moon, but there are none in the Sun: So in the be&s;t of our Graces and Worthine&s;s, there are &s;tains and &s;pots, &s;uch as <HI>God</HI> would abhor to appear before him, did not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Satisfaction of his Dear Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, cover us and appear for us. Chri&s;t Je&s;us is the Wedding Garment, that makes us acceptable to the Father, without Chri&s;t, what &s;hould we do? tis his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s that mu&s;t cover our Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis his Humility that mu&s;t cover our Pride, 'tis his Obedience, that mu&s;t cover our Di&s;obedience, 'tis his Faith that mu&s;t Cover our Diffidence,
<PB N="20" REF="13">'tis his Love that mu&s;t Cover our Hatred, 'tis his Zeal that mu&s;t Cover our Lukewarmne&s;s; and then being Covered with Chri&s;t as with a Garment, there can be no Condemnation un|to us; becau&s;e as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, we are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: for without the pretious Merits of Chri&s;t, we are but Unworthy Gue&s;ts. Was ever Man or Woman &s;av'd by their own Works, by their own Merits, no not the Vir|gin Mary her &s;elf; <HI>My Soul doth Magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit Rejoyceth in God my Saviour,</HI> the&s;e are Holy <HI>Mary's</HI> Words.</P>
<P>The Romani&s;ts will not allow of this Holy and Righteous Garment of Chri&s;t's Satisfaction to be &s;ufficient; but like <HI>David</HI> concerning <HI>Saul's</HI> Armour; it is either too heavy or too long or too &s;hort, and &s;o they &s;trut in a Popi&s;h Coat of their own Merit and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>We read that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> made unto them|&s;elves Coverings of Fig leaves to hide their Na|kedne&s;s, but God did di&s;like the&s;e, and &s;o made them Coats of Skins, and Cloathed them there|with; teaching us, if we patch our own Satisfacti|on, our own Works, our own Dutys, our own Me|rits together, and cover our &s;elves with them as with a Garment, and rely upon them as ha|ving force and Efficacy to &s;ave and help us; then
<PB N="21" REF="13">are we no way fit to appear in the Pre&s;ence of the Eternal God, who accepts of no man, but through the Merits, Works, and Satisfaction of his Son <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> He that looks to be &s;av'd by his own merits, will undoubtedly fall &s;hort of Hea|ven through his own pre&s;umption. It is a &s;aying of <HI>Job, My own cloaths make me abhor'd,</HI> &s;o our own Works without Chri&s;t make us Loath&s;om in the Eyes of God.</P>
<P>Let us all then be per&s;uaded to Ca&s;t off the men&s;truous Rags of our former Conver&s;ation, <MILESTONE UNIT="&V;&s;e."> the old Man, which is Corrupt, according to the Deceitful Lu&s;ts, and be renewed in the Spirit of our minds, putting on the new man which after God is Created in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true Holine&s;s; Labouring to be Uncloathed, that we may be Cloathed upon, that &s;o we <HI>may be found in Chri&s;t, not having our own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law; but of that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by Faith:</HI> Phil. 3. ver. 9.</P>
<P>This is the Garment we mu&s;t Labour for, this is the Garment that we mu&s;t &s;trive and En|deavour to get, for to cover our Poor Naked and Immortal Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. Having &s;hew'd you what this Garment is, I will now &s;hew you how it may be ob|tained.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="14">
<P>A thing may be made ours by diver&s;e means.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may buy it. 2. We may earn it, or de&s;erve it. 3. It may be given us. 4. We may have it by way of Exchange: And now that we may obtain this holy Garment of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, tis the Coun&s;el of Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. <HI>ver.</HI> 15. <HI>Buy of me gold tryed in the Fire that thou maye&s;t be Rich, and white Rayment that thou maye&s;t be Cloathed, that the &s;hame of thy Nakedne&s;s do not appear.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome will Object and &s;ay, <MILESTONE UNIT="Object."> <HI>What must we buy Christ the Saviour of our Souls with Money as</HI> Judas <HI>&s;ould him?</HI></P>
<P>Buy him we mu&s;t, <MILESTONE UNIT="An&s;w."> though not as <HI>Judas</HI> &s;ould him, but as the Prophet &s;peaks in <HI>E&s;a.</HI> 55. <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>Without Money and without Price.</HI> The rea|&s;on of the Term <HI>Buying,</HI> here mentioned, is; becau&s;e there is a near re&s;emblance between the Spiritual, and the Material Buying.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Buying of Material things wee &s;ee a want and need of them, before we buy them.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a Longing or De&s;ire to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is a Re&s;orting to the place where they are to be had.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a laying down of the Money, and taking up of the Ware.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14">
<P>The like way we may ob&s;erve in our Spiri|tual buying.</P>
<P N="1">1. Before we buy a Commodity, we &s;ee the want and need of it; &s;o before we can have this Wedding Garment of Chri&s;t's Merits and Satisfaction, we mu&s;t &s;ee, know, and feel, that we want it, we mu&s;t know what a dangerous State it is to be without it.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we have it not, we have no Peace of Con&s;cience in this World, nor Heaven, nor Happine&s;s in the next.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we are not covered with Chri&s;t, as with a Garment, this Judgment will lay hold on us, we &s;hall be Condemned and thru&s;t out of doors, with the Cur&s;ed Unworthy Gue&s;t in my Text, and have our Portion with the Hy|pocrites, in the Lake which Burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone. Now till we are thoroughly per&s;uaded of the&s;e things, That without this Garment we &s;hall be deprived of the Joys of Heaven, and be made Eternally Mi&s;erable in Hell, we &s;hall never &s;ee the need that we have of this Holy Wedding Garment of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s; the Whole need not a Phy&s;ici|an, but the Sick, <HI>tolle vulnera, tolle opus Medici;</HI> if there be no Di&s;ea&s;e, what need is there of the Phy&s;ician: He that's full, de&s;pi&s;eth the Ho|ney
<PB N="24" REF="15">Comb, tis the hungry that &s;ees and feels the want of Food, that craves and &s;eeks for it: &s;o till wee &s;ee our own Wretchedne&s;s, Blind|ne&s;s, Poverty, dreadful State and Danger, Sin hath brought us into, we &s;hall never be Cloath|ed with this Wedding Garment.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a man wants a Commodity, he longs and de&s;ires after it, he is never quiet till he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; &s;o the&s;e that truly &s;ee the want of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they long and thir&s;t after it, and are ne're &s;atisfied till they do po&s;&s;e&s;s it. <HI>God</HI> gives this Garment to none but tho&s;e that long and earne&s;tly de&s;ire it. <HI>God</HI> &s;aith his Servants &s;hall eat, but fir&s;t they &s;hall be a thir&s;t. <HI>God</HI> pronounceth none ble&s;&s;ed, but tho&s;e that hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; not he that cares not whether ever he hath <HI>Christ</HI> or no, &s;o he may be covered with his Lu&s;t, or his Pride, or his Drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. He that wants a Commodity, will re&s;ort to the place where 'tis to be had; as <HI>Ja|cob</HI>'s Sons, when they wanted Corn, they came down to <HI>Egypt</HI> where 'twas to be had: &s;o if we want this Spiritual Garment, we mu&s;t go where it is; that is, at <HI>Bethel,</HI> the Church and Hou&s;e of God; that is the Spiritual Wardrobe, where
<PB N="25" REF="15">all Heavenly Robes are laid up; there is the very place where Chri&s;t will meet you in his Word and Sacraments: <HI>Where two or three are met together in my Name, I'le be in the midst of them.</HI> Do you think they de&s;erve to be Clothed with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, that prefer World|ly Affairs, Sleep, Lu&s;t, Walking abroad, before the meeting with Chri&s;t in his Holy Church about their Eternal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. He that wants a Commodity, when he comes to the place where it is, he prizes the &s;ame, lays down his money, and takes up the Ware; and by laying down his Money, he &s;hews that he E&s;teems the Ware better than his Money; even &s;o mu&s;t we re&s;olve to throw off all the &s;welling Conceit of our own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, our own Worth, our own Merits, our own Excellency; Accounting all things dro&s;s and dung in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Now <HI>Beloved,</HI> con&s;ider, Is not this a gainful and ble&s;&s;ed Change for us, when we may lay down our own Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and take up Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s? our own Di&s;obedience, and take up Chri&s;t's Obedience; our own Pride, and take up Chri&s;t's Humility? and till we do this, we are no way <HI>Clothed with Christ as with a Garment.</HI></P>
<PB N="26" REF="16">
<P>Thus much of the Proportion which is held between the Material and Spiritual Buying; And now I fear, if mo&s;t men &s;hould examin them&s;elves by the&s;e Points, there would be a great Defect in mo&s;t men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For Proof.</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Do you &s;ee the want of Chri&s;t, the Great Nece&s;&s;ity that you have of his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, to Cloth your Naked Wretched Souls with? You can &s;ee the want of Money, the want of Friends, the nece&s;&s;ity of Preferment; but how few are there who &s;ee the true Want and Nece&s;&s;ity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? but rather like the Prophane Duke that &s;aid, <HI>If he could have</HI> Paris, <HI>he did not care whether ever he had Paradi&s;e.</HI> Never reckon upon <HI>Christ</HI> then, till thou truly &s;ee&s;t the want more of <HI>Christ</HI> than Gold or Sil|ver, Preferment, Health; or what ever this World can afford.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Do you long, thir&s;t, and hunger af|ter <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> And can you be no way &s;atisfied without him? Doth all the Profit and Plea&s;ure of this World look vain and empty without <HI>Christ?</HI> Then thou art Happy. It is ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t men long and covet after the things
<PB N="27" REF="16">of this life, and are never &s;atisfied until they enjoy and po&s;&s;e&s;s what they long, covet and de&s;ire. Now if thou Long'&s;t more for <HI>Christ,</HI> than for <HI>hidden Trea&s;ure;</HI> more for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than for Health and Plea&s;ure of this life, it be&s;peaks thee in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be worthy of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Do you re&s;ort with love and holy &s;incerity to the place of Wor&s;hip where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is; And not out of a Compliance only to the Law of Man, or for fear you &s;hould be &s;u&s;pend|ed from your Imployment? If you do not Con|form, have a care of Hypocritical Jugling. You may deceive Men, but you can't deceive God; for where Man ends, God begins. The Unworthy Gue&s;t in my Text, did Conform outwardly, when he meant nothing &s;o in|wardly: He came as plau&s;ibly to the Table as any, when his Soul and Re&s;olutions were found another way: But for &s;o doing, he was Eter|nally Damn'd.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Do you, when you come before <HI>God,</HI> ca&s;t off all Pride, Meritorious Conceit of your own Excellencies; and with the poor Publican hang down your Heads, beat your Brea&s;ts, &s;ay|ing, Lord have Mercy upon us Unworthy Crea|tures? 'Tis ob&s;erv'd, That mo&s;t men have a <HI>Mountebank</HI>-Opinion of their own worth. <HI>Nar|ci&s;sus</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="17">like, we are very apt to dote upon our own &s;hadows; but let me tell you, that none wears this wedding Garment of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s but he that's contrite &amp; humble in his own eyes.</P>
<P>Now by the&s;e you may know, whether you are fit for the Table of the Lord or no; do you &s;ee the want of Chri&s;t, do you long for Chri&s;t, do you come with Love and Zeal to meet with Chri&s;t; can you willingly lay down your own Righteou&s;ne&s;s and take up Chri&s;t's; then come in the name of God, and eat of this bread and drink of this Cup, or el&s;e it is as much as your Souls are worth to meddle with them.</P>
<P>Now having &s;hewed you what this Gar|ment is, and how you may obtain it: I will now in the la&s;t place &s;hew how you mu&s;t u&s;e it and wear it.</P>
<P>It is the Apo&s;tle's advice, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. <HI>To put on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> for let me tell you, if we don't put on Chri&s;t as a Garment, Chri&s;t will one day put off you with a <HI>nonnovi vos: I know you not, go ye Cur&s;ed into Everla&s;ting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>And now Beloved, that we u&s;e and wear this Garment aright, there are the&s;e two Offices to be performed.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We mu&s;t put off.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We mu&s;t put on.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="17">
<P><HI>First,</HI> Before we can put on we mu&s;t put off; we mu&s;t put off all the filthy rags of our for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">r corruption, our &s;inful nature, our bea&s;t-like affections, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Men, when they put on new Apparel, pull off the old and throw them by; &s;o if you would be cloathed with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, you mu&s;t ca&s;t off the filthy clouts of your Men|&s;truous Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Swearer mu&s;t put off his &s;wearing, the Drunkard mu&s;t put off his drunkenne&s;s, the Un|clean per&s;on mu&s;t put off his filthine&s;s, the Cove|tous man his uncharitablene&s;s, the Envious man his hatred, the Traytor his Trea&s;on, the Idola|ter his Super&s;tition: for let me tell you, that you may as well per&s;wade me that Heaven and Hell are reconciled together, as that Chri&s;t and Sin dwell together in one man; therefore if thou intend'&s;t to be cloathed with Chri&s;t as with a Garment, thou mu&s;t put off, as the A|po&s;tle &s;aith in the <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.3. <HI>All uncleanne&s;s, in|ordinate affections, evil Concupi&s;cence, Wrath, Malice, Bla&s;phemy, filthy Communication, lying one to ano|ther.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As you mu&s;t put off, &s;o you mu&s;t put on; and the means to put on Chri&s;t is faith, believing, apprehending and appropriating
<PB N="30" REF="18">Chri&s;t and his Merits to our &s;elves, we mu&s;t be|lieve all the promi&s;es of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us made unto man, and particularly apply the &s;ame unto our own &s;elves, which is only done by the Act of true Faith.</P>
<P>Faith is as it were the hand of the Soul which doth reach Chri&s;t unto us and put him on. Would'&s;t thou have Chri&s;t dwell in thy heart, would'&s;t thou put him on as a Garment? believe Chri&s;t with thy mind and heart, and thou ha&s;t him.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Beloved,</HI> that I may leave nothing wanting of my part to put you in the right way for Eternal happine&s;s, you mu&s;t know that it is not every Faith, or bare Believing of Chri&s;t will put on Chri&s;t as a Garment. No, then the Devils may put him on, for they believe all the Hi&s;torical part of the <HI>Bible,</HI> from the Fir&s;t of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the la&s;t of the <HI>Revelations:</HI> Hypocrites believe in God and in Chri&s;t, and yet for all that they are thrown to the hotte&s;t place of Hell.</P>
<P>Now that Faith that is &s;aving Faith, that like a Hand reacheth Chri&s;t, and puts him on, is an <HI>Operative</HI> and working Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Faith, that's &s;aving, as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Purifieth the Con&s;cience:</HI> &s;o then if thy Faith
<PB N="31" REF="18">be true, it clean&s;eth thy Soul from &s;in; it clean|&s;eth thy Soul from Covetou&s;ne&s;s; it clean|&s;eth thy Soul from Lu&s;t; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Pride; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Re|venge; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Drunken|ne&s;s; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Hypocri&s;y, it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Rebellion; it clean|&s;eth thy Soul from Trea&s;on; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Idolatry; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from Faction; it clean&s;eth thy Soul from all man|ner of Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Devils Believe, but they cannot be clean|&s;ed from their black Abominations; Hypo|crites believe, and profe&s;s and make a fair &s;hew of outward Holine&s;s, but their hearts are not clean&s;ed from Oppre&s;&s;ion, Lu&s;t, Murder, Trea|&s;on, and Rebellions. Our Saviour of old Com|pares them to Tombs, now you know that Tombs are oft u&s;ually the mo&s;t beautiful Or|naments of the Church; but let a man digg within them, and he &s;hall find nothing but pu|trifaction, &s;tink, and dead mens bones. Never &s;ay then, that thou Believe&s;t &s;avingly, or that thou ha&s;t more Faith than Devils, Hypocrites; while Sin and Wickedne&s;s governs thy Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> True Saving Faith works by Love: So it produceth Works; <HI>Shew me thy Faith by thy
<PB N="32" REF="19">Works,</HI> &s;aith St. <HI>James.</HI> Where there is true Faith in the Soul, like the Centurion, it <HI>&s;aith to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he come|eth,</HI> it Commands all our Actions, our Hand to Di&s;tribute to the Poor, our Feet to Walk in the Commandments of God, our Hearts to be Upright towards our God, and towards our Neighbours, our Tongue to Declare the Lo|ving Kindne&s;s of the Lord.</P>
<P>Faith in the Soul of Man, is like Sap in a Tree that lies hid; but Holy Works are like Fruit that &s;hews it &s;elf; where there is true Faith in a Man, there will be Holy Works, there will be Hope, there will be Charity, there will be Repentance, there will be Godly Zeal: The Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Ju&s;t live by Faith;</HI> That is, they live the Life of Holy|ne&s;s; they live the Life of Religion, they live the Life of Sobriety, they live the Life of Cha|&s;tity, they live the Life of Humility, they live the Life of Godly Love. They do not live the life of Prophanene&s;s, they do not live the life of Drunkenne&s;s, they do not live the life of Lu&s;t, they do not live the life of Pride, they do not live the life of Revenge and Malice; the&s;e are the Works of the De|vil.</P>

<P>Labour therefore for a true Saving Faith, A Faith that clean&s;eth thy Soul from Sin, and worketh by Love: If a man &s;hould come and tell a Per&s;on that's Rich, that all the Writings in his Che&s;t, that A&s;&s;ur'd him of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, were Forged &amp; Counterfeit, would it not make him &s;tart and go to his Che&s;t, take them out and have them read and con&s;idered on by the be&s;t and learned Council? and &s;hall not we look after our Faith, to &s;ee whether that be Sound and Real, which is an Evidence of our Eternal Inheritances. Without the Garment of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s to cover our Souls, we &s;hall never go to Heaven; and there is no put|ting this Garment on, without a true &s;anctifi|ed Faith: Faith is the Hand of the Soul that puts on Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>Which God of his Infinite Mercy grant; To whom be a&s;cribed all Honour, Power, and Glory, Adoration and Subjection, from this time forth, and for ever more. And let all the People &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
