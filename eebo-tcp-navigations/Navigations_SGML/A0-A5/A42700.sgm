<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NEver till I had the Ho|nour of your Conver&s;a|tion, was I &s;en&s;ible how unea&s;ie Ambition &s;its upon Mankind. This has made me labour long under the Pride of
<PB REF="3"> pre&s;enting &s;omething to your Pa|tronage; and de&s;ign'd it upon a Graver Subject than what now im|plores your Protection. But con|&s;idering the Politene&s;s of your Learning, and that there is nothing in the whole Circle of Sciences, that has e&s;cap'd the ju&s;tne&s;s and &s;everi|ty of your Cen&s;ure, I dur&s;t not &s;tand the Te&s;t of &s;o nice and uni|ver&s;al a Critick, in offering any Philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ay to your View. This made me change the De&s;ign of putting off &s;ome of my imperfect Tracts under the Glory and general Approbation of your Name, in the Common-wealth of Learning, into that of Contributing to your Di|ver&s;ion. A Relaxation of the Mind from more &s;erious Studies, is often
<PB REF="3"> nece&s;&s;ary to the large&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous <HI>Genius</HI>'s; and I am &s;ure by furni&s;hing to your Recreation, I gratifie all that know you. Be|&s;ides, Sir, I fancy the fair Sex will ju&s;tifie me in this Addre&s;s: and there is po&s;&s;ibly a World of La|dies of a Noble Gentleman's Ac|quaintance, who&s;e Hearts, if we con&s;ulted, would tell us, with how much Ju&s;tice <HI>the Di&s;orders of Love</HI> lay Claim to his Protection. And here, Sir, an infinity of Mat|ter pre&s;ents its &s;elf for Panegyrick. And might I expatiate, I could run through a long Hi&s;tory of the Glo|ries of your Family; but that the World would tell me, that as the be&s;t of Families might pride them&s;elves in your Ance&s;tors, yet your own Vir|tues
<PB REF="4"> are &s;o tran&s;cendent, that the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of your Ance&s;tors, can pride them&s;elves in nothing more than you. And indeed, when the whole Nation was almo&s;t tainted, your Loyalty was Ermine-like. And thus you credited Arms, and Let|ters, and Good Mien. A Plain Dealer, Sir, would tax me here, I am &s;ure, with being wanting in your ju&s;t Eulogies; but I am &s;ure I &s;hall never be wanting in the Zeal, Re|&s;pect, and Pa&s;&s;ion, wherewith I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE NEW DISORDERS OF LOVE. A Gallant Novel.</HEAD>
<P>TWO Per&s;ons of Quality in <HI>Picardy,</HI> being at va|riance about &s;ome Lands, plung'd them&s;elves over head and ears in Law; and for a long while per&s;ecuted one another. They were near Relations, and of the &s;ame Family; both bearing the
<PB N="2" REF="8"> &s;ame Name, and the &s;ame Arms. Their Di&s;pute was about the &s;ha|ring of an E&s;tate, and of &s;uch great Con&s;equence, as tended to one or the other's ruin. As they were eminent in their Province, their mutual friends made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to procure a Reconciliati|on, and for that purpo&s;e propos'd a Match. They had no more Chil|dren than one Son and one Daugh|ter; and the&s;e friends having made them under&s;tand, that the means of removing all their differences, was to marry them together, they ac|cordingly re&s;olved &s;o to do. The Son was not unhand&s;ome, but whym&s;ical in his humour: and as the advantages of the mind are to be preferr'd to tho&s;e of the body, he was not in the be&s;t Repute ima|ginable in his Neighbourhood. The Daughter was agreeable, and pro|mi&s;ed much. She was yet &s;o green in years, as not to know the mean|ing of an Hu&s;band. Thus when
<PB N="3" REF="8"> they talk'd of marrying her, &s;he &s;eem'd indifferent; but when &s;he knew it to be to her Cou&s;in, &s;he was extreamly afflicted. She told a woman that had had care of her Education, that better would it have been for her, that her Father had been ca&s;t in his Law-&s;uit. The woman made her an&s;wer, that &s;he wondered to hear her talk in that manner, and that there was nothing to be found fault with in the Per|&s;on that was propo&s;ed to her. As a Di&s;pen&s;ation was nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e, they &s;ent to the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> and while the Me&s;&s;enger was on his journey, the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Florange,</HI> &s;o was her Suiter's Name, made love to her. He had lived almo&s;t altogether in his Coun|trey; in&s;omuch that his Deport|ment could not wipe out the di&s;|advantageous Impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had entertained of him. On the con|trary, the more &s;he &s;aw him, the le&s;s &s;he e&s;teemed him; in him find|ing
<PB N="4" REF="9"> many bad, and few good Qua|lities.</P>
<P>From that time &s;he did nought but weep, fore&s;eeing all the mi&s;|fortunes wherewith &s;he was threat|ned. At la&s;t, the Di&s;pen&s;ation be|ing come, &s;he could not decline marrying him: but he enamoured her never the more after he was her Hu&s;band, than he had done when he was her Gallant.</P>
<P>In a little while after the Wed|ding, a great E&s;tate fell to <HI>Florange:</HI> and this enabled him to &s;pend at an high rate. His Wife &s;tudying to di&s;tance him, told him then, that we liv'd now in a Reign wherein Martial Men were only valued, and that though the bare thoughts of his ab&s;ence troubled her extreamly, yet could &s;he not but advi&s;e him to take upon him &s;ome Military Employ: That their Lands lying in the pa&s;|&s;age of the Forces, the means to pre&s;erve them, was to do as Per&s;ons of Quality did: That &s;he had
<PB N="5" REF="9"> heard, how that in the time of his Ance&s;tors a Soldier did not ap|proach 'em but with re&s;pect; and &s;hould be overjoyed he might a|gain have the &s;ame influence.</P>
<P>The Marqui&s;s <HI>de Florange</HI> was of a Family that had produc'd brave men; but the Valour of his Ance&s;tors had not reach'd his Per|&s;on; in&s;omuch that he had been but one &s;ingle Campaign in the Army: Nay, and he returned thence two months before the re&s;t, as in no wi&s;e delighting in that Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Thus finding little &s;atisfa|ction in his Wives Di&s;cour&s;e, he re|ply'd, that her contrivance lay to get him out of the way; but be|&s;ides the Concerns of his Family, that wedded him to his own hou&s;e, he was in no wi&s;e enclined to give her that &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s was picqu'd by his an&s;wer; and as this his carriage &s;poke his little regard for her, &s;he told him, that it was long &s;ince &s;he
<PB N="6" REF="10"> had begun to take notice of his ill humour; but that it was not fitting he &s;hould cloak his Capriciou&s;ne&s;s with a Pretext that did an injury to others. And &s;he happened to mut|ter him out a Coward: and as no|thing is &s;o offen&s;ive as truth, the Marqui&s;s fell into an extraordinary rage; and they proceeded to give one another hard words.</P>
<P>Some days after, <HI>Florange</HI> being obliged to go thence to <HI>Paris,</HI> upon a Proce&s;s of Con&s;equence, was at a plunge, whether he &s;hould take his Wife along, or leave her at home. He began to be jealous of her, yet without cau&s;e; for as yet &s;he &s;aw no body that either had a de&s;ign upon her, or on whom &s;he could be accus'd of having any. But whether that <HI>Florange</HI> had a &s;ecret foreknowledg of his misfortune, or that really he in her found &s;ome in|clination to Gallantry, ordered one of his Dome&s;ticks before his de|parture, to have an eye upon her
<PB N="7" REF="10"> actions. This Dome&s;tick was a middle-aged man, and &s;eemed ve|ry di&s;creet. He had been in the Wars in his Youth, where he had learnt to live; but this was all the profit he had made by them; for having been reform'd upon the <HI>Py|renaean</HI> Peace, and being de&s;titute of maintenance, he was forced to accept of the fir&s;t Employ that was propo&s;ed to him; and the Mar|qui&s;s <HI>de Florange</HI>'s Father having offered him his hou&s;e, he accord|ingly li&s;ted him&s;elf in his Family, as his Gentleman of the Hor&s;e, and to have an eye upon his Son, who was then very young. The Con|dition was mean for &s;uch a man as he; but nece&s;&s;ity made him pa&s;s o|ver all things. Yet though his For|tune was low, his heart was not the le&s;s: and indeed he had never lo|ved other than women of Quality, and from the time he fir&s;t &s;aw the Marchione&s;s, he found he was not proof again&s;t her Charms. How|ever,
<PB N="8" REF="11"> Re&s;pect kept him &s;ilent. But the Marqui&s;s his Commi&s;&s;ion begin|ning to &s;ooth him, he fancied &s;ome Change might happen in his For|tune, and that he might in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the Marchione&s;s's good Opinion, he imparted the Order to her he had received from her Hus|band; and a&s;&s;ured her that he was more at her Devotion than at any bodies in the world. The Marchi|one&s;s was &s;urprized at this Di&s;|cour&s;e, yet not &s;o much for the knowledg it gave her of her Hus|band's Jealou&s;ie, as for this mans good will. For as he had been a long while with the Marque&s;s <HI>de Florange,</HI> and his Father, &s;he could not apprehend how he &s;o lightly quitted their Intere&s;ts, to embrace tho&s;e of a per&s;on he but lately knew. After that this thought had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her for &s;ometime, in&s;tead of gue&s;&s;ing at what thus bya&s;&s;ed <HI>Grand Champ,</HI> &s;o was the Name of this Dome&s;tck, &s;he imagined that
<PB N="9" REF="11"> he had perceiv'd her innocence, and had only offered her his &s;ervice out of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean while, if her Hus|band had not &s;eemed over-amiable to her before this, &s;he then thought him altogether horrible, and at his return from <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;he had all the pain imaginable to endure him. He came back at length towards the end of Summer, which was very bad that year, by rea&s;on of the con|tinual Rains. The &s;ucceeding <HI>Au|tumn</HI> was &s;till more unplea&s;ant, in|&s;omuch that all the People of Qua|lity in the Countrey, &s;eeing the bad weather, talk'd of repairing into the Cities. The greater part went to <HI>Paris;</HI> but the Marquis did not think it convenient to carry his Wife thither, he thinking her of too <HI>Mo|di&s;h</HI> an humour. He knew the Hu&s;bands were not in &s;afety there; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are not over|amiable, and have very lovely Wives. The Marchione&s;s expected
<PB N="10" REF="12"> to &s;pend the Winter in that Town, he having promi&s;ed &s;he &s;hould in the beginning of the Summer; but &s;eeing he changed his mind, this &s;till help'd to make her hate him the more. Neverthele&s;s, as he him|&s;elf did not over-much delight in a Countrey-hou&s;e, he re&s;olv'd to go into &s;ome &s;mall City, where the in|fluence was not &s;o maligne for mar|ried people as it might be at <HI>Paris.</HI> His E&s;tate lay about <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons;</HI> and this was the place he cho&s;e in which to recreate him&s;elf during the bad wea|ther. This Town is &s;o pretty, in&s;omuch that the Marchione&s;s lov'd it how|ever better than her Village. No &s;ooner were they got thither, but that the Kings Army in <HI>Flanders</HI> had Orders to &s;eparate, and march a|way to their Winter-Quarters. Ma|ny Officers in their Road to <HI>Paris,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> and one a|mong the re&s;t, of an extraordinary merit, and of a very eminent Qua|lity; his Regiment had encamped
<PB N="11" REF="12"> the year a-fore near the Walls of the Town, with five or &s;ix others, that had &s;taid there for fifteen days, in|&s;omuch that he had &s;pent that time in making his Court to a Citizen's Wife; and he came purpo&s;ely to &s;ee her again, &s;he having not u&s;ed him &s;everely.</P>
<P>After he had &s;een her, knowing <HI>Florange</HI> to be at <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> with his Lady, he paid him a Vi&s;it. They had made acquaintance at <HI>Paris</HI> two years before, but had never &s;een the Marchione&s;s, though he had heard her highly extolled. He found her Fame was &s;till &s;hort of her Beauty and Merit, in&s;omuch that he could not forbear telling <HI>Florange</HI> what he thought of his Choice. The Mar|qui&s;s; though of a temper to be ea|&s;ily jealous, was not alarm'd at the prai&s;es he conferr'd upon his Wife, as knowing Courtiers to be prodigal of them.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, on her &s;ide, liked the Colonel extreamly, and
<PB N="12" REF="13"> was as much charm'd with his good Meen as his Reputation; for he had perform'd Actions in War that had made him very con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>The Marqui&s;s <HI>de Florange</HI> asked him what brought him to <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> becau&s;e that was not the direct way to go to Court; and as young peo|ple have commonly more Vanity than Di&s;cretion, the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Mainville,</HI> &s;o was this Officer called, own'd ingenuou&s;ly the love he had for the Citizen's Wife, and that &s;he was the cau&s;e of his little journey. After this &s;ecret, <HI>Florange</HI> did not wonder to &s;ee him &s;tay &s;ome time in the City, and the more becau&s;e that people began already to talk of his Intrigue. As &s;oon as the Rumour of it came to the Marchione&s;&s;es ears, &s;he perceiv'd her &s;elf vex'd at the Choice he had made, as if &s;he had already intere&s;&s;ed her &s;elf in him. She mu&s;t needs &s;ee the Woman that had made &s;o fine a Conque&s;t; but &s;he &s;aw her not, &s;ave with the Eyes
<PB N="13" REF="13"> of a Rival; for though &s;he was pa&s;&s;ably beautiful, &s;he found her al|together unworthy of the thoughts of a man of Honour. <HI>Mainville</HI> knew not what pa&s;&s;ed in his favour in the Marchione&s;&s;es bo&s;ome; but without penetrating into her &s;enti|ments, he had &s;uch for her, as came very near tho&s;e &s;he had for him. He found her infinitely lovely, and her Hu&s;band, on the contrary, &s;eem'd to him unworthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her.</P>
<P>He had been told, that he was the mo&s;t jealous of all men, in&s;o|much that he pitied her, being fall|en into the hands of a Per&s;on, who &s;o little knew how to reli&s;h the happine&s;s he had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o beauteous a Woman. However, though this thought po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him wholly, he endeavoured to conceal it as much as he could from all the World, for fear of creating Su&s;pici|ons in the Marque&s;s <HI>de Florange</HI>'s Brea&s;t, who after that, would not
<PB N="14" REF="14"> fail of forbidding him to come to his hou&s;e, or of carrying his Wife back into the Countrey. Thus he re&s;olved to u&s;e &s;o much My&s;tery in his Love, that no body &s;hould have the lea&s;t inckling of it, &s;ave the Marchione&s;s, bounding all his cares to tell her in private what &s;he had kindled in his heart. Thus he for nothing reckon'd the con&s;traint he lived in, being well enough &s;atisfi|ed, provided he gave no jealou&s;ie to her Hu&s;band. He hoped hereby to render him&s;elf agreeable to the Marchione&s;s, as knowing that Wo|men, above all things, prize Di&s;|cretion. But the Sympathy they had entertained for one another at their fir&s;t enterview, had already produc'd &s;o much effect upon her, that there was no need of this ad|dition of Civility, to in&s;inuate him into her good Opinion. And in|deed whatever her Vertue could dictate to her, to &s;tifle certain agree|able motions &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of in
<PB N="15" REF="14"> her &s;elf, upon thinking on him, &s;he could not overcome them. Thus &s;he perceiv'd, that if &s;he meant to pre&s;erve her Innocence, &s;he mu&s;t di&s;tance her &s;elf from a place where &s;he could not &s;tay, without running the ri&s;que of being ruin'd. But much ado had &s;he to come to this Re&s;olution, becau&s;e nothing is &s;o difficult to reject, as agreeable thoughts; but con&s;idering it to be the only means to ward off the affli|ctions with which &s;he was threat|ned, &s;he de&s;ired the Marquis <HI>de Florange,</HI> that he would go to his Countrey-hou&s;e; if not, that he would &s;uffer her to go thither with|out him.</P>
<P>He ask'd her, what could be the cau&s;e of &s;o great a change; and her an&s;wer was, that the Air of the Town injur'd her, and that that of the Countrey would be much better for her. Yet as &s;he looked well, he thought this to be only a Pretext, and was not over-ha&s;ty to grant her
<PB N="16" REF="15"> her reque&s;t. Be&s;ides, he him&s;elf hated, as I have &s;aid, the Coun|trey, in&s;omuch, that for fear of be|ing oblig'd of returning thither, he de&s;ir'd the Marquis <HI>de Mainville</HI> to prevail with her to &s;pend the Winter at <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> telling him, that &s;he would ever contribute towards his Diver&s;ion, in ca&s;e he made any &s;tay in that Town. <HI>Mainville,</HI> who had hitherto in vain waited for an occa&s;ion to &s;peak to the Marchio|ne&s;s in private, was over joy'd at this which Fortune &s;ent him. He went at the &s;ame time into her Chamber, and &s;urpriz'd her ex|treamly by his manner of coming thither; for he was quite out of countenance, and as a man newly labouring under &s;ome great trou|ble. She ask'd him, what put him upon coming to &s;ee her, he that had not been to &s;ee her &s;ince he came to Town: and this obliging reproach affording him matter of entring in|to Di&s;cour&s;e, he made her an&s;wer,
<PB N="17" REF="15"> that it would be ea&s;ie for him to &s;a|tisfie her upon that point, if &s;he would take the trouble of hearing him. Thereupon he acquainted her how pa&s;&s;ionately he had lov'd her from the fir&s;t moment he &s;aw her; but that having perceiv'd the jea|lous humour of her Hu&s;band, he had kept that &s;trict hand upon him|&s;elf, that he believ'd neither he nor &s;he had taken notice of his Pa&s;&s;ion. That <HI>Florange</HI> &s;ent him thither to di&s;cour&s;e her upon bu&s;ine&s;s; but being unable to live any longer without knowing after what man|ner &s;he would receive the offers of his &s;ervice, he took that time to ask her, whether &s;he would render him unhappy, that he had blaz'd about his de&s;ign to lye upon another; but that the per&s;on he had pretended to love, &s;erv'd only for a Cover to his real inclinations, &s;ince he was un|capable of loving any other than her.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="16">
<P><HI>Mainville</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e &s;eem'd to be extreamly grateful to the Mar|chione&s;s, &s;ince &s;he was as fervently lov'd by him as &s;he lov'd him; ne|verthele&s;s &s;he fell a weeping, as if he had inform'd her of the Death of all her Friends. So extraordi|nary a procedure put <HI>Mainville</HI> in|to an extraordinary &s;urprize. He ask'd her, why &s;he griev'd &s;o very much; but the more he pre&s;&s;ed her to an&s;wer him, the more her grief &s;eemed to augment. He then fell to eying her from head to foot, fearing &s;he was not over-wi&s;e. This thought had been capable of cu|ring him; but the Marchione&s;s breaking &s;ilence, told him, he would not wonder at her tears af|ter what &s;he had to acquaint him withal: That &s;he lov'd him as much at lea&s;t as he could love her; and that this her weakne&s;s made her fear|ful: That her De&s;ign was to main|tain her Vertue; but that it was difficult to an&s;wer for it, when one
<PB N="19" REF="16"> had &s;uch an inclination for a per&s;on, as &s;he had for him. She then in|form'd him of the reque&s;t &s;he had made to her Hu&s;band, of carrying her back to their Countrey-hou&s;e, that &s;he might have the means of &s;hunning his &s;ight; and <HI>Mainville</HI> knew well enough that &s;he &s;poke the truth, &s;ince he him&s;elf was en|charg'd to divert her from her Re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>As it is natural to flatter ones &s;elf, <HI>Mainville,</HI> in&s;tead of being alarm'd at her Vertue, thought only to thank her for her kind thoughts of him; but the Marchione&s;s inter|rupting him in the mid&s;t of his Di&s;|cour&s;e, told him roundly, that he was not yet got where he imagined, and that the more &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of her weakne&s;s, the more efforts &s;he was going to u&s;e never to &s;ee him again. It is ea&s;ie to imagine, that he attempted to in&s;pire her with other Sentiments, and exerci|&s;ed his utmo&s;t Wit for that purpo&s;e;
<PB N="20" REF="17"> but the Marchione&s;s was a Woman of Courage, in&s;omuch that after having left him, &s;he &s;ent for <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> to de&s;ire a great &s;ervice of him. That he had great Credit in her Hu&s;bands good Opinion, and wi&s;h'd he would employ it &s;o, in obtaining his permi&s;&s;ion for her to return into the Countrey. <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed at this Di&s;|cour&s;e, as knowing the aver&s;ion the Marchione&s;s had for a &s;olitary life. Thus his an&s;wer was, that &s;he thought not on what &s;he &s;aid; and turning her Di&s;cour&s;e into Railery, he a&s;&s;ured her he &s;hould ever be &s;o careful of her content, as not to procure her a thing as would &s;o much accrue to her di&s;&s;atisfaction. Then was the Marchione&s;s oblig'd to put on her mo&s;t &s;erious looks, to let him know that &s;he &s;poke in good earne&s;t; and at length &s;he did &s;o thorowly repre&s;ent to him, that it would be the doing her a kindne&s;s, that he promi&s;ed her to do all he
<PB N="21" REF="17"> could with <HI>Florange,</HI> to content her in her de&s;ires. The Marchione&s;s in di&s;cour&s;ing <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> was as free in her &s;peech with him, as &s;he might be with a man who&s;e Conver|&s;ation could not be of any Con&s;e|quence, in&s;omuch that &s;he chanc'd to &s;ay, that &s;he &s;hould be as happy with him in a Village, as if &s;he was in the be&s;t City in the world. This man did not want a good Opinion of him&s;elf, in&s;omuch, that inter|preting the&s;e words at the foot of the Letter, he thought he was hap|pier than he had imagin'd. He had ever cloak'd his Love with the appearances of Civility and Re|&s;pect; he then imagin'd, that with|out being too vain, he might give it le&s;s narrow bounds. Thus he re|&s;olv'd on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, to be|moan him&s;elf for the Sentiments he had &s;o long entertained for her, not doubting but that the &s;ucce&s;s would be an&s;werable to his hopes.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="18">
<P>The Marchione&s;s did from day to day wait for her Hu&s;band's an|&s;wer, when <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> to cut off what was lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, told her, that he found it difficult to ob|tain what &s;he de&s;ired; but that he would not de&s;i&s;t however. In the &s;pace between the Marchione&s;&s;es re|que&s;t, and <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s an&s;wer, she &s;aw the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Mainville</HI> again; and his Vi&s;its did not help to cure her of her Pa&s;&s;ion. On the contrary, she became &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that she was afraid, that if the&s;e In|terviews la&s;ted any long time, she should have much a do at length to reject his per&s;ecutions; for he was too urging. Wherefore she told <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> that she had a &s;ecret to tru&s;t him withal, but that being of the utmo&s;t moment to her, to confide it only in the hands of a man, on who&s;e di&s;cretion she might relie; she would have him fir&s;t &s;wear, that he would never &s;peak of it to any body. <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was
<PB N="23" REF="18"> pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as I have &s;aid, with a great Opinion of him&s;elf; and this di&s;cour&s;e fully per&s;wading him of his good fortune, he made a thou|&s;and Oaths of Fidelity to the Mar|chione&s;s, to induce her to declare her &s;ecret to him. She thereupon told him, that though it was not hand&s;ome for a Lady to own her weakne&s;s, &s;he could not however conceal it any longer, without ren|dring it remedile&s;s. That &s;he had an inconceivable confu&s;ion for it; but that he ought rather to pity than blame her; and &s;o much the more, as that &s;he u&s;ed her utmo&s;t endea|vours, as that &s;he might have no|thing to reproach her &s;elf withal: That &s;he was going to unbo&s;om to him, to the very &s;ecret motions of her heart, that it would be for him to condemn her after this, if he found her culpable.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Marchione&s;s had &s;aid nothing but what entertained <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> in his fooli&s;h hopes;
<PB N="24" REF="19"> but when &s;he had declar'd to him the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had for <HI>Mainville,</HI> and that he had for her, he was, for all the world, in as great confu|&s;ion, as if he had been caught in do|ing &s;ome ill action. <HI>How Madam,</HI> cry'd he, after &s;ome moments of &s;i|lence, <HI>You love the Marqui&s;s</HI> de Mainville! <HI>the Marque&s;s de</HI> Mainvil|le, <HI>who is over head and ears in love with a Citizen's Wife, and who out of Court&s;hip to her, has abandon'd the Care of his Fortune? Yes, I love him,</HI> the Marchione&s;s reply'd faintly, <HI>and my de&s;iring to di&s;tance my &s;elf from hence, is only for that I am afraid of loving him too much. Many Women in my place, would perhaps contrive the means of &s;eeing him on all occa&s;i|ons; but for my part, I mean to a|void him, becau&s;e he has a &s;ecret Charm, again&s;t which I cannot de|fend my &s;elf. Ah Madam! Grand-Champ</HI> reply'd, to whom all the&s;e words were as &s;o many &s;tabs into his heart; <HI>&s;eek an other Confident
<PB N="25" REF="19"> than me; I find not my &s;elf proper to render you the &s;ervice you require of me, and I &s;hould deceive you if I had promi&s;ed you.</HI> At the&s;e words he went his way, all tran&s;ported with anger, without vouch&s;afing to hear her farther. The Marchione&s;s did what &s;he could to detain him, be|ing very willing to clear all his &s;cru|ples; but &s;he took her time ill, &s;ince the rage he was in to &s;ee him&s;elf fal|len from his hopes, put him into an inconceivable De&s;pair.</P>
<P>As he had manife&s;ted a great deal of Pa&s;&s;ion in the reproaches he had made her, it was no difficult mat|ter for the Marchione&s;s to know, that he was <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Rival. She call'd to mind a world of actions that Love had made him commit, which &s;he had not minded be|fore; but which then confirm'd her in the thought &s;he had of him, in|&s;omuch that &s;he was extreamly vex|ed that &s;he had made him her Con|fident. However, as there was now
<PB N="26" REF="20"> no Remedy, &s;he fell to contriving how to appea&s;e him, and fancied &s;he might do it, had he any rea&s;on left. For &s;he repre&s;ented to her &s;elf, that not being Mi&s;tre&s;s of her own heart, he ought to be &s;atisfied with the efforts &s;he made to &s;tifle her Pa&s;|&s;ion, and with the Re&s;olution &s;he had taken to withdraw into the Countrey. Said &s;he likewi&s;e to her &s;elf, that if he lov'd her, he would help her to obtain her Hu&s;band's leave for that purpo&s;e, which she pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired, &s;o to root out a Love, which all agreeable as it was, yet made her labour under great ap|prehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>While &s;he was expecting this from <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s jealou&s;ie, <HI>Mainville</HI> being allarm'd at the in&s;tances &s;he made to <HI>Florange,</HI> that &s;he might leave the City, did &s;lily inculcate &s;u&s;picions in the mind of that cre|dulous Hu&s;band; &s;ometimes telling him, after a drolling manner, that his Wife was in love with &s;ome or
<PB N="27" REF="20"> other in his Neighbourhood. But <HI>Florange,</HI> who far from being tra|ctable upon that matter, was &s;u&s;|ceptible of the lea&s;t thing, concei|ved &s;uch di&s;advantageous impre&s;&s;i|ons of her Conduct, that when &s;he &s;poke to him again, of returning to their Countrey-hou&s;e, he not only deny'd her, but did it after &s;uch a di&s;obliging manner, that &s;he was netled to the very heart. At fir&s;t &s;he had recour&s;e to her fears; but Grief having made room for Re|&s;entment, it came into her head, to revenge her &s;elf that way he mo&s;t apprehended. For &s;ome time &s;he found a certain plea&s;ure in enter|taining her &s;elf, with this thought; but her Vertue having got the a&s;|cendant, &s;he blu&s;ht for having been capable of conceiving a thing to her &s;o di&s;advantageous.</P>
<P>In a few days after, <HI>Grand Champ</HI> entred her Room with a wild, &s;taring look, and &s;uch as &s;uited very much with the &s;tate of his Soul. He told
<PB N="28" REF="21"> her, that he came to take his leave of her, and that he had at that time &s;uch concerns upon his hands, as oblig'd him to be gone. His Complements &s;urpris'd the Marchione&s;s. She en|deavoured to divert him from his Re&s;olution, rightly gue&s;&s;ing at the occa&s;ion; but he made her an&s;wer, that he could not &s;tay any longer in a place where he &s;hould have dai|ly before his Eyes, a Rack a thou|&s;and times more cruel than Death it &s;elf. That after what &s;he had told him, as he knew the effects of Love, he did not doubt but that the pa&s;&s;i|on &s;he had for the Marquis <HI>de Main|ville,</HI> would rather augment than di|mini&s;h; that he fore&s;aw &s;trange Con|&s;equences, not that he &s;u&s;pected her of being ever wanting to her Ver|tue, but out of the knowledge he had of her Hu&s;band's jealous hu|mour, who would be over joy'd to find a Pretext to u&s;e her ill.</P>
<P>Thus did <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> under fine appearances, conceal the real
<PB N="29" REF="21"> Cau&s;e of his di&s;content: for it was only Jealou&s;ie that induc'd him to de&s;ire to be gone. In the mean while he put a thou&s;and fears into the Marchione&s;&s;es head, by the mi&s;|fortunes with which he threatned her: and if the love &s;he had for <HI>Mainville,</HI> had not already been ve|ry violent, his Di&s;cour&s;e had been capable of clearing her heart of it intirely. She could have wi&s;h'd it had been in her power &s;o to have done. And indeed that &s;he might have a per&s;on to &s;u&s;tain her &s;tagger|ing Vertue, &s;he conjur'd <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> not to abandon her in her pre&s;ent Condition, promi&s;ing him to do all things imaginable to over|come her weakne&s;s. <HI>You'l &s;ee,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to him, <HI>that the love I have for</HI> Mainville, <HI>is not an effect of my in|clination; and that one's Star may be rectify'd, when it would hurry us into the precipice again&s;t our wills. And indeed to what u&s;e would our rea|&s;on be, if we cannot put it in practice
<PB N="30" REF="22"> when we have need of it? and with|out this, what difference would there be between Men and Bea&s;ts?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was &s;o troubled, that he could hardly under&s;tand one bare word of what the Marchi|one&s;s &s;aid; but &s;eeing &s;he pre&s;s'd him a new to give her an&s;wer: <HI>What would ye have me tell you, Madam,</HI> he reply'd to her, <HI>and will you force me, willy nilly, to own my Crime t' ye? I am as culpable as un|fortunate; I know what I am, and what you are; and the knowledge I have of both, has not hindred me from loving you. I adore you, &s;ince I mu&s;t needs tell you &s;o, and you adore the Marquis</HI> de Mainville. <HI>After this, the only cour&s;e for me, is to di|&s;tance my &s;elf from hence; and tho you &s;hould pardon me the exce&s;s of my temerity, I could not pardon my &s;elf for it, and for having dar'd to love you, without being capable of exciting the &s;ame flames in you as you have ex|cited in me. An other in&s;pires you
<PB N="31" REF="22"> with tho&s;e agreeable movements, which I would make you &s;en&s;ible of at the co&s;t of my life. Thus it is no longer plea&s;ant to me, &s;ince I have nothing more to hope.</HI> At the&s;e words he would have gone his ways, without &s;taying for an an&s;wer; but the Marchione&s;s re-calling him, made him turn his Head again&s;t his will; and he ob&s;erv'd an inconceivable grief in her face. <HI>What would ye have of me, Madam,</HI> he then re|torted, with an air wherein Love and De&s;pair did equally appear? <HI>Would ye have me &s;uffer here all that is mo&s;t cruel for man to &s;uffer? That I &s;ee every day before me the mo&s;t love|ly Lady living, without daring to lift up my Eyes to her: Thus I contem|plate the love I have for the Marquis</HI> de Mainville, <HI>and that in&s;en&s;ible to the one or other, I lead out the mo&s;t langui&s;hing life in the world: No, Madam, you ought not to oblige me to this: you your &s;elf would be a lo|&s;er, in &s;uffering &s;uch a Wretch as I
<PB N="32" REF="23"> am, to dare to tell you, that he loves you; and though you could bear with it, yet it would not ea&s;e me; I &s;hould have ever before my Eyes the Marquis</HI> de Mainville<HI>'s happine&s;s; and perhaps that believing my &s;elf as worthy of being belov'd as he, notwithstanding the difference there is between our For|tune, I &s;hould tell you things as might di&s;plea&s;e you. It is better for me all at once to di&s;tance my &s;elf from the mo&s;t amiable per&s;on breathing; and though it co&s;t me my Life, Death will be more plea&s;ant to me than a &s;ight that will make me die every moment.</HI> At the&s;e words he would again have been going, but the Marchione&s;s holding him by the arm, told him, that if he was minded to oblige her, he would &s;till &s;tay with her Hu&s;|band: That &s;he bore him not &s;o much ill will for his temerity, as &s;he might have done at an other time, becau&s;e &s;he her &s;elf knew the power of Love. That as to the re&s;t, &s;he was willing to forget all things, pro|vided
<PB N="33" REF="23"> he promis'd her never to &s;peak to her of his Pa&s;&s;ion. That Rea&s;on mu&s;t govern him, as she pro|mis'd him to let it govern her her &s;elf: That she would have him to be a Witne&s;s of the efforts she was go|ing to make, to drive <HI>Mainville</HI> out of her heart; and that if she could not effect that, he would, at lea&s;t, be with her to mind her of her Vertue.</P>
<P>In fine, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to re|&s;i&s;t what one loves, <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> could not decline obeying the Mar|chione&s;s, and continued to &s;tay with <HI>Florange.</HI> Neverthele&s;s if she had &s;o much indulgence for him, it was not without very powerful rea&s;ons. She con&s;ider'd, that the exce&s;s of his Di&s;pair might prompt him to re|veal her &s;ecret, and that it would be better for her to con&s;train her &s;elf, than be expos'd to the anger of a Lover, who had ju&s;t occa&s;ion to complain. On the other &s;ide, as her de&s;ign was to be vertuous, she
<PB N="34" REF="24"> imagin'd that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s pre|&s;ence would be capable of keeping her in, and that narrowly watching her actions, she should be asham'd after what &s;he had told him, of ma|nife&s;ting any Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus while she was &s;tudying all po&s;&s;ible means for her &s;ecurity, <HI>Mainville</HI> omitted nothing of what might give a happy &s;ucce&s;s to his Love. He from time to time found the means of di&s;cour&s;ing the Mar|chione&s;s; and his Conver&s;ation ru|in'd that Ladies Projects. She dai|ly di&s;cover'd &s;ome new Quality in him, as render'd the Vice le&s;s hide|ous to her, in&s;omuch that she was no longer &s;o very de&s;irous to return in|to the Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Florange,</HI> all jealous as he was, perceiv'd nothing as yet; but the Citizen's Wife, whom <HI>Mainville</HI> had courted before, finding him more faint than ordinary, examin'd the Cau&s;e of it, and was not long without detecting it. Her Rage,
<PB N="35" REF="24"> upon this, was extream; and she was upon the point of letting her jealou&s;ie break out, without con&s;i|dering she should injure her &s;elf as much as the Marchione&s;s. How|ever, &s;till fearing to be deceiv'd, she would have new Proofs of her Lover's Infidelity, before she pro|ceeded to Reproaches again&s;t him, and to Invectives again&s;t her Ri|val.</P>
<P>This Citt, though not of Quali|ty, did neverthele&s;s make &s;ome Fi|gure in the Town, as being very rich, and pa&s;&s;ably hand&s;ome. She was one in all the Merry-meetings of that place; and the &s;ea&s;on of the Carnival then requiring people to be in Di&s;gui&s;e, as is the Cu&s;tom, <HI>Flo|range</HI> de&s;ir'd her to make one in a Ma&s;querade, which <HI>Mainville,</HI> and his Wife were to be of. And that they might be the finer, they &s;ent for Cloaths from <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;ix for Men, and &s;ix for Women. They were all alike, and &s;uited well enough with
<PB N="36" REF="25"> an Entry. They meant to dance at the Wedding of a very pretty Maid, that was to be very &s;uddenly marri|ed. That Day being accordingly come, they procur'd the admiration of all the Company, who were not wont to &s;ee people that danc'd &s;o well as did <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Florange.</HI> After they had danc'd, the&s;e Lovers plac'd them&s;elves by one another, and <HI>Mainville,</HI> on whom the Citt had her Eyes fixt, having care&s;s'd the Marchione&s;s a little too much, it is difficult to expre&s;s her vexation on that account. Being tran&s;ported with anger, she went in&s;tantly to make a thou&s;and Reproaches to that perfidious man; but having met in the way a female friend of hers, that &s;topp'd her, she neither found <HI>Main|ville,</HI> nor the Marchione&s;s, who had left their places to take others. She endeavour'd to find them out in the Crowd, and the Re&s;emblance of Cloaths deceiving her, she &s;aid to
<PB N="37" REF="25"> <HI>Florange,</HI> whom she took for <HI>Main|ville, You betray me, Marquis, but Ile be reveng'd on Madam</HI> de Florange, <HI>though I were to die a moment after Florange</HI> knew the Citts voice again, and her Di&s;cour&s;e making an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon his Mind, that was but too &s;u&s;ceptible of jealou&s;ie, he made way into the Crowd, without giving her one word of an&s;wer. The Ci|tizen's Wife's Rage was inconceiva|ble in this occa&s;ion; She imagin'd her &s;elf ab&s;olutely flighted, by the manner of his leaving her, and wi&s;h'd &s;he could extingui&s;h her pa&s;|&s;ion in a moment; but not being able to effect that, &s;he turn'd all her thoughts to revenge.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s being ignorant of what pa&s;s'd, did in a Corner enjoy one another's Conver&s;ation, with|out dreaming, that love was prepa|ring them any trouble. <HI>Florange</HI> &s;ought 'em over all, and finding them &s;tept a&s;ide, he perceiv'd his
<PB N="38" REF="26"> Fury to re-double. He had open'd his Mouth to ask them what they did there; but con&s;idering that the Bus&s;le he might make, would retort upon him&s;elf, he made &s;emblance of being ill, that he might have a pre|tence to go home. When he was come to his hou&s;e, he bid his Wife prepare to leave <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> on the mor|row morning. She ask'd him the rea&s;on; but without vouch&s;afing to &s;pecifie any thing, he contented him|&s;elf with letting her know, that he was not &s;atisfy'd with her Conduct. She did not clo&s;e her Eyes all the Night long, making however le&s;s reflection on <HI>Florange</HI>'s anger, than on <HI>Mainville</HI>'s cruel &s;eparation, &s;he beginning to love him more than her own Life. She lay contriving the means to bid him adieu; but not knowing how to do that, &s;he re&s;ol|ved to write to him as &s;oon as it was day. In effect, &s;he was already thinking of having Pen and Paper, when a new Di&s;quiet did utterly
<PB N="39" REF="26"> confound her Repo&s;e. She knew not with whom to tru&s;t her Letter, and thereby plainly &s;aw, that it would be to no purpo&s;e for her to write. The day being come, &s;he began to &s;lumber, when her Hu&s;|band told her, that for a per&s;on that was to take a journey, it became her not to &s;leep &s;o late. Whereupon he made her get out of Bed; after which he went into her Clo&s;et, and took thence her Ink and Paper, &s;ay|ing, that he mu&s;t rifle her of her Court&s;hip, and deprive her of the means of letting her Lover hear from her.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s look'd upon him then after a &s;cornful manner, with|out making him any reply; but &s;he lo&s;t all her firmne&s;s when &s;he was to take Coach; then did &s;he revolve <HI>Mainville</HI>'s De&s;pondency in her Mind, when he came to know of her Departure; and her Lover's Affli|ction affected her more than her own Grief. However, as Love becomes
<PB N="40" REF="27"> the &s;tronger by per&s;ecution, &s;he quickly perceiv'd that &s;he lov'd him more than &s;he had ever yet lov'd a|ny body. After &s;he was come to their Countrey hou&s;e, her Hu&s;band &s;u&s;pecting that &s;he would not re&s;t &s;o contented, if the Love &s;he had for <HI>Mainville</HI> was in any wi&s;e &s;trong, he left her neither Ink nor Paper, be|&s;ides forbidding his people to give her any, though &s;he ask'd for it.</P>
<P>While all this pa&s;s'd in this manner, <HI>Mainville</HI> dreaming of nothing le&s;s than of what had happen'd, &s;ent a <HI>How d' ye</HI> to <HI>Florange</HI>'s Lodgings. The man he had encharg'd with this Me&s;&s;age being return'd thence, and having brought him back word, that he was gone that morning with his Wife, to return to his own hou&s;e, &s;urpriz'd him extreamly. He would believe nothing of it at fir&s;t, but it having been confirm'd to him from another hand, he pre&s;ently judg'd, that &s;o &s;udden a departure was the effect of <HI>Florange</HI>'s Jealou&s;ie. He
<PB N="41" REF="27"> likewi&s;e fancy'd, that there was on|ly him&s;elf in the Town that he could &s;ix it upon. Thus he rejected his fir&s;t thoughts, which &s;ugge&s;ted to him to run after his Mi&s;tre&s;s. Then &s;eeing that it would be to no pur|po&s;e for him to &s;tay any longer at <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to be gone to <HI>Paris,</HI> whence he had a de&s;ign to &s;end a man on purpo&s;e to the Mar|chione&s;s. As he was ju&s;t ready to take Hor&s;e, the Citizen's Wife came to his Lodgings, all tran&s;ported with Fury; for &s;he had newly been told, that he was ju&s;t a going, without &s;o much as bidding her farewell. She upbraided him with what &s;he had done for him, and his little acknow|ledgment for all, and forgot not to &s;peak of what had pa&s;s'd the Even|ing before, accu&s;ing him of being the mo&s;t ungrateful of all men, in not vouch&s;afing &s;o much as to take the pains to undeceive her. <HI>Main|ville</HI> being &s;urpriz'd at this reproach, which he did not think he had in|curr'd,
<PB N="42" REF="28"> caus'd the thing to be ex|plain'd to him at length; and &s;eeing that the Citt's mi&s;take had occa&s;i|on'd <HI>Florange</HI>'s Jealou&s;ie, he made her no great reparation for his Cold|ne&s;s; and on the contrary, treated her with &s;ufficient Contempt. Af|ter having di&s;mi&s;s'd her, he departed the Town, on the Road thinking only of the Marchione&s;s, who on her &s;ide was only taken up with his re|membrance. For without otherwi&s;e minding her Husband's rigours, who treated her with &s;ufficient indignity, and who had her watch'd by five or &s;ix per&s;ons, to whom he had not been a&s;ham'd to di&s;cover his Weakne&s;s; she wish'd for nothing el&s;e than to know what was become of <HI>Main|ville.</HI> Thus all her thoughts only tending that way, she took a Re&s;o|lution difficult to form, but which was a &s;trong Proof of her Love. For forgetting all the allarms she had had by having confided her &s;ecret in <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> she conceiv'd a de&s;ign
<PB N="43" REF="28"> to make u&s;e of him to be the <HI>Go|between</HI> of her and <HI>Mainville,</HI> and to let him hear from her. She knew not however what cour&s;e to take to exact this Service from him, after what &s;he had &s;aid to him; for &s;he dreaded his Reproaches. At length Love being &s;tronger in her than any other Con&s;ideration, &s;he conjur'd him, with Tears in her Eyes, to free her out of pain, and carry a Letter to her Lover. <HI>You love me, Grand-Champ,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to him, <HI>and I &s;hall be glad to know it in this Occa&s;ion. You'l make me die of Grief, if you re|fu&s;e me: whereas you'l re&s;tore me to Life by doing me this Service. It will co&s;t me mine, Madam,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> immediately, <HI>and you have the cruelty, to de&s;ire that I &s;hould die the mo&s;t cruel Death imaginable. But no matter, &s;ince this must oblige you, it is for me to obey you without reply.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;he had thus got his con&s;ent, &s;he ask'd him for Paper and Ink; which he was oblig'd to furni&s;h her
<PB N="44" REF="29"> withal accordingly. When &s;he had writ her Letter, &s;he gave it him, begging him to make di&s;patch, that &s;o <HI>Mainville</HI> might receive it before he arriv'd at <HI>Paris,</HI> whither &s;he &s;u&s;|pected him to be going. <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> all pierc'd with Grief, took it from her hands, and pretending &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, that he might get <HI>Florange</HI>'s leave, he mounted on Hor&s;e-back, and overtook <HI>Main|ville</HI> half way. <HI>Mainville,</HI> whom the Marchione&s;s had made the Con|fident of <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s Love, trem|bled at her ra&s;hne&s;s in tru&s;ting him with a matter of this con&s;equence; but at the &s;ame time admiring the fi|delity of this Dome&s;tick, he would needs embrace him, and &s;peak the &s;ence he had of &s;o generous an acti|on. But <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> retiring two &s;teps back, to avoid his Care&s;&s;es, told him, that far from a&s;&s;uring him, that he was his Servant, he would franck|ly tell him, that there was not a man in the World, that he hated more
<PB N="45" REF="29"> than him; that he was well enough acquainted with the rea&s;on; and that if he had &s;toop'd &s;o far as to de|liver him a Letter from the Marchi|one&s;s, he thought him po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;o much delicacy, as not to confound the Character of a pa&s;&s;ionate Lover, with that of an Unfortunate Rival: That he might judge of his Love by the in&s;tance he had newly giv'n of it, and the more this Love was violent, the more the effects of it were to be feared.</P>
<P><HI>Mainville</HI> took no notice that he heard his Menaces: and indeed far from &s;hewing any re&s;entment, he did what he could to gain &s;o generous a man, offering him a World of fine things, as of advancing him in War, and &s;erving him with all his Credit. But all the&s;e Promi&s;es did not work upon <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> to do any thing that was low, maintaining his gene|ro&s;ity to the la&s;t. After this <HI>Main|ville</HI> made an&s;wer to the Marchio|ne&s;s, and put his Letter into the
<PB N="47" REF="30"> hands of this Dome&s;tick. She had &s;ent him Word in hers, of what had been the Occa&s;ion of her Departure, and how out of the de&s;ire &s;he had to &s;ee him again, &s;he would rather feign &s;ome illne&s;s, that &s;he might go to the Waters of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> She was overjoy'd to hear, that <HI>Mainville</HI> would on his &s;ide be there; for &s;o he a&s;&s;ur'd her by his Letter, in&s;o|much that &s;he only di&s;cours'd <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> of her impatience till the &s;ea&s;on of the Waters was come. <HI>The time betwixt this and that,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to him, <HI>will la&s;t me a thou&s;and years, and out of the fondne&s;s I am under, of &s;eeing him again, there will not be a day but will &s;eem longer than whole years to me. I own that hopes will in &s;ome manner ea&s;e my pain; but whatever Ble&s;&s;ing I expect from &s;o dear a &s;ight, I &s;hall purcha&s;e it dear|ly by the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es I am going to be under, for fear he &s;hould fail his Word. Grand-Champ,</HI> continu'd &s;he, <HI>May not the King march to his
<PB N="46" REF="30"> Conque&s;ts in the time of Waters, and do&s;t thou think that</HI> Mainville <HI>can di&s;|pence him&s;elf from following him? Honour is a thing very nice in the Soul of a Man of Quality, and I am undone, if</HI> Mainville <HI>prefers it before his Love.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grand-Champ</HI> hearken'd to all this with a Countenance wherein De&s;pair and Rage &s;eem'd to tri|umph over his Pa&s;&s;ion. Nay, and &s;ometimes was he ju&s;t ready to load her with Reproaches, if by a re|turn very u&s;ual with Lovers, he had not been more afraid of vex|ing her than of any thing el&s;e. However being no longer able to &s;tay in the pre&s;ence of a Woman that &s;et him a raving mad, he went his ways without &s;aying a word to her. But &s;he was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with her Reflexions, that &s;he did not &s;o much as take notice of what was be|come of him.</P>
<P>When it was at length the &s;ea&s;on of drinking the Waters, &s;he ask'd
<PB N="48" REF="31"> her Husband leave to go thither, and he could not han&s;omely refu&s;e her, becau&s;e &s;he had pretended to be &s;ick, having be&s;ides &s;lily engag'd the Phy&s;icians to &s;ay that &s;he &s;tood in need of them for her recove|ry. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Florange</HI> being re&s;olv'd not to leave her one &s;tep, made &s;emblance on his &s;ide, that the Waters would be good for him, and went along with her. The Marchione&s;&s;es &s;pite was extraordi|nary in this Occa&s;ion, and if &s;he had dur&s;t, &s;he had let it fly out to &s;trange Extremities. She then fell to thinking how to break off this Journey; but making reflexion, that &s;o doing would but too clear|ly manife&s;t her Intrigue, &s;he re|&s;olv'd to adverti&s;e <HI>Mainville</HI> of what occur'd, that he might take his mea&s;ures for his &s;eeing her on the Road.</P>
<P><HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was again encharg'd to carry him this News; and having accordingly done it with the &s;ame
<PB N="49" REF="31"> fidelity he had exerted the time be|fore, <HI>Mainville</HI> took Hor&s;e for <HI>Mon|targis,</HI> and &s;tay'd in the be&s;t Inn, where the Marchione&s;s had writ him word &s;he was to lodg. Neverthe|le&s;s he had no other Train than a <HI>Valet de Chambre;</HI> and for the obvi|ating all &s;u&s;picion, in ca&s;e he &s;taid there any time, he pretended to be &s;ick, that he might at freedom wait the Marchione&s;&s;es coming. Two days after, &s;he arriv'd there with her Hu&s;band; and no &s;ooner was &s;he alighted, but that &s;he gave <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> order to acquaint <HI>Mainville,</HI> that &s;he was de&s;irous to &s;ee him. <HI>Mainville</HI> told <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> that could not be till after her Husband was gone to Bed; and as the Marchione&s;s did not lie with him, they would have all &s;ort of lei&s;ure of conver&s;ing together. When <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had giv'n this account to the Marchione&s;s, <HI>Ah my God!</HI> cry'd &s;he, <HI>That's impo&s;&s;ible: How &s;ee me by Night? That's &s;eek|ing
<PB N="50" REF="32"> his own ruin, and the ruining of my &s;elf. What would</HI> Florange <HI>&s;ay if he came to know it? and would there after that be any mercy for me? What &s;ay you,</HI> Grand-Champ? <HI>give me good advice in this matter. Grand-Champ,</HI> being enrag'd at what he did, and what he was &s;till oblig'd to hear, an&s;wer'd not a word; but &s;eeing that &s;he pre&s;s'd him to tell her his Opinion; <HI>How, Madam,</HI> he reply'd to her, <HI>Ought you not to be &s;atisfy'd with what I here do, but you mu&s;t needs con&s;train me to di&s;cour&s;e you upon a thing of this nature? And to what purpo&s;e would it be for me to di&s;&s;wade you from &s;eeing the Marquis</HI> de Main|ville, <HI>&s;ince you will not follow my advice? Why will I not follow it,</HI> the Marchione&s;s an&s;wer'd; <HI>and &s;hould I not be glad, that you would let me &s;ee that it was impo&s;&s;ible to af|ford him this &s;atisfaction. No, Ma|dam, it is not impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> reply'd <HI>Grand-Champ, &s;ince that you doubt
<PB N="51" REF="32"> of it, and you will infallibly &s;ee him in your Chamber, &s;ince you only deli|berate to know whether the thing be fea&s;ible or not. I thought you would have declin'd it out of fear of wound|ing your honour; but the happy Mar|quis triumphs over your Scruples. You at fir&s;t told me, you meant to &s;hun him, with &s;uch a World of Precau|tion; and now you are no longer a|fraid of &s;ingling him out to a private Rendezvouze. Ah,</HI> Grand-Champ, <HI>you are mistaken,</HI> the Marchione&s;s an&s;wer'd, <HI>and if he comes into my Chamber, I mean not, that you &s;hall go one &s;tep from me, that &s;o you your &s;elf may be a Witne&s;s, that nothing &s;hall there pa&s;s, but what's hone&s;t; and that though I be wanting to Decency, I at lea&s;t am not wanting to Virtue. No, 'tis you that are mistaken, Madam,</HI> cry'd <HI>Grand-Champ, if you believe you can be wanting to Decorum, with|out being wanting to Virtue; for there is &s;uch a connexion between them two, that a per&s;on can no longer be &s;aid to
<PB N="52" REF="33"> be innocent, when &s;he has once fail'd in her Conduct, It is for you to make reflexion thereupon; and if it proves my misfortune, that my Remon&s;tran|ces will nothing avail, you need only &s;ay what you de&s;ire of me: I will &s;till bring, if you order me, this happy Lo|ver, into your very Chamber; but do not oblige me to be pre&s;ent at a Conver&s;ation that would make me mad.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had made her the&s;e offers, &s;he took him at his Word, conjuring him to pay her this Service. She no longer in|&s;i&s;ted for him to be pre&s;ent in the Room with <HI>Mainville;</HI> and this Circum&s;tance ca&s;t him into the ut|mo&s;t De&s;pondency; for he fram'd &s;uch things in his imagination as &s;he did not in the lea&s;t dream of; and which his Jealou&s;ie neverthele&s;s made him think to be real. The Marchione&s;&s;es Chamber was at the end of a Gallery; and there was a kind of <HI>Anti-chamber,</HI> where <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="33"> had Orders to lye. The Marquis <HI>de Florange</HI> having com|manded him to watch his Wife's Conduct &s;o narrowly, as that he might be able to give an exact ac|count of it. Thus it lay in his pow|er to let in whom he pleas'd; and the exce&s;s of his love requiring him to pay this Service to his Rival, he introduc'd him into the Marchio|ne&s;&s;es Chamber, and &s;hut the door upon them. While <HI>Mainville</HI> was there, an Adventure happen'd in the Inn, that made them both more than a little unea&s;ie. One of the Ser|vants being in Love with the Maid, and fancying he had perceiv'd &s;ome Bowels of kindne&s;s in her towards him, he &s;tole &s;oftly into her Cham|ber, and made her &s;tart out of her &s;leep. This Wench being hone&s;t, beyond what is ordinary in tho&s;e of her &s;tamp, being to the highe&s;t de|gree &s;urpriz'd at his in&s;olence, gave then a great Scream, which put all the hou&s;e into allarum. The Mar|quis
<PB N="54" REF="34"> <HI>de Florange</HI> awak'd at this noi&s;e, as well as the re&s;t, and having heard how the ca&s;e &s;tood, he was heard to cry out aloud, <HI>kill him, kill him.</HI> For he had a natural aver&s;ion for all tho&s;e that endeavour'd to debauch other mens Wives; fearing, that if he appear'd indulgent upon the Ar|ticle, it might give &s;ome Gallant the Boldne&s;s to &s;parkle it to his. His Voice immediately &s;truck <HI>Mainvil|le</HI>'s and the Marchione&s;&s;es Ears; and <HI>Mainville</HI> thinking it was him he meant, drew his Sword at the &s;ame time, telling the Marchione&s;s, that it would not be &s;o ea&s;ie a matter as was imagin'd, to take away his Life. At the&s;e Words he broke out of her Arms, that gra&s;p'd him ten|derly, as if &s;he meant to bid him a la&s;t farewell, and ru&s;hing out of the Chamber, he ran towards the place where he heard <HI>Florange</HI> a talking. When he was got to the end of the Gallery, he perceiv'd him in his Night-Gown, by the Light of a
<PB N="55" REF="34"> Candle, which a Lacquey held be|fore him. This Lackquey no &s;oon|er &s;aw <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Sword glitter, but that he let fall the Candle out of fear, at the &s;ame time giving a di&s;|mal Schriek. <HI>Florange,</HI> for his part made ha&s;te into his Chamber, ha|ving likewi&s;e perceiv'd the Sword; in&s;omuch that <HI>Mainville</HI> finding no body to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age with him, he entred his own Room, with|out <HI>Florange</HI>'s being able to &s;ay, who had put him to &s;o great a fright.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Marchio|ne&s;s being under a mo&s;t doleful di&s;|quiet for what would happen to <HI>Mainville,</HI> went out into the Galle|ry to li&s;ten; but coming to know, that the noi&s;e that had been made in the Inn, had been occa&s;ion'd by the Man and Maids Adventure; and hearing no talk of her Lover, &s;he di&s;pers'd her fears. After this <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> advis'd her to go to Bed, that if her Husband &s;hould by chance come into her Chamber, he might
<PB N="56" REF="35"> not ask why &s;he had &s;ate up &s;o late. Hardly was &s;he undrefs'd, but that <HI>Florange,</HI> who had had time to call all his People to his &s;uccours, came, and knock'd at her Door, with &s;uch a noi&s;e, that a body would have &s;aid, he meant to break it open. <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> went and open'd it; and the fir&s;t thing <HI>Florange</HI> ask'd him, was, if a man did not go out of his Chamber with his Sword in his hand. He made him an&s;wer, that no body could go out there, &s;ince the Door had been always &s;hut, and that if he had not heard his Voice, he would not have open'd it. After this, <HI>Florange</HI> knock'd at his Wife's Chamber-door; and there &s;he made him wait for &s;ome time, to make him believe that &s;he was in a deep &s;leep. At la&s;t &s;he made &s;em|blance of awaking her Woman, that was a Confident of her Intrigue, and who had been pre&s;ent all the while <HI>Mainville</HI> &s;taid with her. <HI>Florange</HI> tax'd 'em both with their &s;leeping &s;o
<PB N="57" REF="35"> fa&s;t, after they had a&s;&s;ur'd him, they heard not the lea&s;t of all the noi&s;e that had been made in the Inn.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Florange</HI> had left his Wife, he made reflexion upon the Vi&s;ion he had had of the Sword, and relying upon what <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had &s;aid to him, he fancy'd the man to have come out of &s;ome of the next Chambers to that of the Marchione&s;s. Thus all was appeas'd in the Inn; after which all fell a&s;leep again, as if nothing had happen'd. There was only <HI>Mainville,</HI> the Mar|chione&s;s, and <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> that could not be of tho&s;e that ta&s;ted of Re&s;t; for their Amour furni&s;h'd them with &s;ufficient matter of anxi|ety. As for <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> it is ea|&s;ie to judge he was over-whelm'd with grief, and that he could not think of his cruel De&s;tiny, without believing him&s;elf the mo&s;t unfortu|nate of all men. As to <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s, though they
<PB N="58" REF="36"> ought to be &s;o &s;atisfy'd, being &s;ure of one anothers Love, yet they had great cau&s;e of vexation. They had hop'd to have enjoy'd one anothers Company for a whole Night toge|ther, and an unhappy Adventure of a Man and a Maid, had di&s;appoint|ed their hopes. Be&s;ides, they knew not when they might &s;ee one another again; for as they had not had the lei&s;ure to take their mea&s;ures toge|ther, <HI>Mainville</HI> was upon the point of returning to the Army, and the danger he was going to run, did extraordinarily allarum his Mi|&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Day being come, <HI>Florange</HI> and his Wife continued their way; and being arriv'd at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> they took the Waters, of which they had no great need. But as it is not the &s;ame thing with tho&s;e Waters, as with the Water of the <HI>Seine,</HI> which one may drink of, without fear of injuring ones &s;elf, they &s;poil'd their Stomacks, either that they had al|ready
<PB N="59" REF="36"> a Di&s;po&s;ition thereunto, or that God thought fitting to puni&s;h them for feigning to be &s;ick. Their Indi&s;po&s;ition began with a great In|dige&s;tion, which at fir&s;t hinder'd them from &s;leeping, and a <HI>Fever</HI> coming thereupon, it was fear'd this Malady might have ill Con&s;equen|ces. Thus for prevention, they had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t able Phy&s;ici|ans; but they exhau&s;ted their whole Knowledg, without giving any ea&s;e to their Patients. This occa&s;ion'd their Friends to begin to de&s;pair of their Health. The Marquis <HI>de Main|ville</HI> was then at the Army, whither he went after the adventure of <HI>Mon|turgis.</HI> The Marchione&s;s, thinking her &s;elf at the Extremity, &s;ignify'd to him the &s;tate &s;he was in; and he had no &s;ooner learnt this ill News, but that he re&s;olv'd to go &s;ee her, let what would come on't. There was no room for his de&s;iring leave. The King granted none: Wherefore he pretended him&s;elf &s;ick, that he might
<PB N="60" REF="37"> have a pretence to be carry'd into a Neighbouring Town. As &s;oon as he was there arriv'd, he won the heart of his Landlord, and of a Phy&s;ician, and prevail'd with them to give out, that he was in great danger; in&s;omuch, that when any one came to pay him a Vi&s;it, they &s;aid, he was not to be &s;een, by rea|&s;on of the Violence of his Di&s;tem|per. His Servants had al&s;o Order to remain bare-headed in his Room, and when any Per&s;ons came to en|quire after his Health, they made them an&s;wer &s;oftly at the Door, as if they had been afraid of di&s;turbing his Head. In the mean while <HI>Main|ville</HI> having taken his mea&s;ures thus well, went away Po&s;t in the dusk of the Evening, and repair'd to <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> where the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Flo|range</HI> was &s;ick. He &s;aw her by <HI>Grand Champ</HI>'s means, and found her in better Health than he expect|ed. For her Di&s;temper, when ju&s;t upon the point of tumbling her in|to
<PB N="61" REF="37"> her Grave, was dimini&s;h'd all on the &s;udden; and but that her looks &s;poke her to have been ill, a man would hardly have believ'd it, &s;o well was &s;he recover'd. The Mar|chione&s;&s;es joy was great, to &s;ee &s;o &s;ignal an in&s;tance of her Lover's Pa&s;&s;ion. She embrac'd him with an extraordinary tenderne&s;s, and by in|&s;atiable Care&s;&s;es, te&s;tify'd &s;he could never &s;ufficiently expre&s;s her ac|knowledgment.</P>
<P><HI>Mainville,</HI> who was as fooli&s;h as are all people that are in Love, was charm'd with her affection, and neg|lected his Duty; in&s;omuch that he was now but little afraid of his Cheat coming to be detected. Thus giving all his Thoughts, and all his Cares to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, his contrivance lay only how to be daily with her; in which he found neverthele&s;s &s;ome difficulty, becau&s;e that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was to depart that very Evening, to go into <HI>Picardy,</HI> whither he was &s;ent by <HI>Florange.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, to
<PB N="62" REF="38"> return after having &s;een her but once, was a thing he could not re|&s;olve on, finding he had hazarded too much to have &s;uch &s;canty &s;atisfa|ction. In fine, after having one while li&s;ten'd to his Rea&s;on, which adviz'd him to return to the Army, and another while his Pa&s;&s;ion, that thwarted tho&s;e Intentions, this lat|ter got the A&s;cendant, and he &s;tu|dy'd the means of getting to &s;peak, at lea&s;t once again with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, For that purpo&s;e he dre&s;s'd him&s;elf up as a Phy&s;ician, and under that Habit he had free admittance into her Chamber, without needing any body to introduce him. Though that his Features were too deeply engrav'd in the Marchione&s;&s;es mind, for her to mi&s;take him, yet the &s;ur|pri&s;e of that Lady was extream, when he took her by the Arm, to feel her Pul&s;e. She immediately dimi&s;s'd all the Servants out of the Room, except her Woman, whom &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect. Then giving
<PB N="63" REF="38"> <HI>Mainville</HI> a &s;trong Reprimand, for expo&s;ing him&s;elf and her too to &s;uch a danger, &s;he forbid him to venture &s;o again, telling him, that he ought; at lea&s;t, to adverti&s;e her of his Di&s;gui&s;e, to prevent her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e. <HI>Mainville</HI> excus'd him&s;elf the be&s;t he could, rejecting all up|on his Love, and upon his not ha|ving known that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was to be gone till after he had left her. After this Conver&s;ation, they be|gan an other, extreamly tender; and as they were going to engage deeply into amorous &s;oftne&s;&s;es, the Marchione&s;&s;es u&s;ual Phy&s;ician came in, who was &s;trangely &s;urpriz'd to find an other Phy&s;ician at the &s;ick Beauties Beds-head. His Cheeks glow'd for meer anger, thinking that he was &s;lighted. He ask'd <HI>Mainville,</HI> by who&s;e Order he came thither, he whom he did not know to be of the Faculty of <HI>Paris. Mainville</HI> was &s;trangely <HI>non plus'd</HI> at his Que&s;tion, &s;eeing how furi|ous
<PB N="64" REF="39"> he was upon the matter: But making a Vertue of Nece&s;&s;ity, he reply'd, that he went no where without being &s;ent for: That though he was not of the Faculty of <HI>Paris,</HI> yet he was not the le&s;s expert; and that the Phy&s;icians of <HI>Montpelier</HI> did in nothing come &s;hort of all the Phy&s;icians of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>There is a certain Antipathy be|tween the Phy&s;icians of <HI>Paris,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> in&s;omuch that this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;till augmented the u&s;ual Phy&s;ician's Re&s;entment. He took fire at the &s;ame time, and after having di&s;charg'd his Choler again&s;t this new Doctor, he told the Mar|chione&s;s, that &s;ince &s;he put &s;o much Confidence in an ignorant Fellow, &s;he might make u&s;e of him, and that it was the la&s;t time he would vi&s;it her. Neverthele&s;s, upon his going away, he went to <HI>Florange</HI>'s Chamber, where his heart being full of what had befallen him, he com|plain'd
<PB N="65" REF="39"> of the Affront that was done him. <HI>Florange</HI> was &s;till ve|ry &s;ick, being nothing &s;o near his recovery as his Wife was to hers. For he had &s;till daily Tran&s;ports in his Brain, that made him rave; but being the mo&s;t jealous of all men, he immediately di&s;tru&s;ted the <HI>Montplier</HI> Phy&s;ician, and to &s;ee if he was not mi&s;taken, he at the &s;ame time took his Night-Gown, and went into his Wives Chamber. On the way he told the Doctor, that it was for his &s;ake that he took this pains, as being willing to conceal his Jealou&s;ie. The Doctor was &s;o tran&s;ported with Anger, that he made not any effort to hinder him; and though he knew well enough in his mind, that &s;tirring out of his Bed did not befit his pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances, yet he was over-joy'd that he had this &s;atisfaction given him. <HI>He'l be your Death,</HI> &s;aid he to him as they went along, <HI>if you make u&s;e of him. He is but a meer Quack,
<PB N="66" REF="40"> and that you'l pre&s;ently perceive by his Meen.</HI> As he entertain'd him with &s;uch like Di&s;cour&s;es, to animate him the more, they entred the Marchio|ne&s;&s;es Chamber; and <HI>Florange</HI>'s &s;ur|pri&s;e was extraordinary, when he found that the Phy&s;ician of <HI>Mont|pelier,</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Main|ville,</HI> were but one and the &s;ame thing. <HI>How,</HI> cry'd he at the &s;ame time, <HI>the Marquis</HI> de Mainville <HI>is turn'd Doctor! How can that be, and &s;ince when is this</HI> Metamorpho|&s;is? <HI>I mu&s;t be reveng'd, and offer up to my re&s;entment a Friend that ruines me, and triumphs over my Honour.</HI> At this Name of <HI>Mainville,</HI> which was univer&s;ally known, the true Phy&s;ician remain'd as much con|founded as <HI>Florange:</HI> for he then plainly &s;aw he had committed a great mi&s;take, in di&s;covering what but for him had been conceal'd. He trembled for fear, knowing how dangerous it was to incur the Indignation of a man of that Con|&s;equence,
<PB N="67" REF="40"> Wherefore he would have given all he had to have re|triev'd the Blunder he had made.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, <HI>Mainville</HI> and his Mi&s;tre&s;s were no le&s;s afraid than the Doctor; but Love, which was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of this Di&s;order, &s;ince it was it that had induc'd <HI>Mainville</HI> to put him&s;elf into a Di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ug|ge&s;ted a thing to <HI>Mainville,</HI> that freed them both out of perplexity. He began to &s;eize upon the Marquis <HI>de Florange,</HI> crying, that his Fren|zy took him; and that if they did not carry him back to Bed, it was capable of being his Death. He at the &s;ame time trode upon the Phy&s;i|cian's Foot; and he under&s;tanding what this meant, joyn'd with him to make the poor <HI>Florange</HI> believe, that he was very ill. <HI>Good Lord! what a furious tran&s;port,</HI> cry'd the Doctor at the &s;ame time, <HI>to take a Phy&s;ician for a Marquis, and to &s;u&s;|pect him al&s;o of attempting upon his Honour. My Lord, you must drink
<PB N="68" REF="41"> a refre&s;hing Pti&s;anne, or el&s;e you are a lo&s;t man. Florange</HI> was terribly enrag'd at this Di&s;cour&s;e, as not over-well knowing whether he rav'd or not. However, the two Phy&s;icians, his Wife, and her Wo|man, ceas'd not dragging of him into his own Room, and putting him to Bed again in &s;pight of his teeth. Then had he a real Phren|zy, holding a thou&s;and extrava|gant Di&s;cour&s;es. The Phy&s;ician of <HI>Montpelier</HI> took that time to bid the Company farewel; and the Marchione&s;s &s;aw him depart with le&s;s regret; judging, that af|ter what had happen'd, it would be putting him into too evident a danger, and her &s;elf too for to de|tain him.</P>
<P>When <HI>Mainville</HI> was gone away, he went to his Hou&s;e who writes the <HI>Gazet;</HI> where in con&s;ideration of &s;ome money, he had in&s;erted, that he was extream &s;ick in the Town where he was thought to be,
<PB N="69" REF="41"> and that there was no longer any hopes of his Life. From thence he went to <HI>Florange</HI>'s Phy&s;ician, to whom he &s;aid, that he pardon'd him for having hamper'd him in &s;o unlucky a bu&s;ine&s;s, provided he would maintain to the very la&s;t, what he had &s;o well began. He thereupon acquainted him with what he had newly done, that &s;o he might di&s;abu&s;e <HI>Florange,</HI> if he continued to affirm, that he was paulm'd upon by his Wife. He told him, that the <HI>Gazet</HI> was to be vended the next day throughout the City, and that this fell out ve|ry pat for their purpo&s;e. After this, he went his ways for the Ar|my, where there was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of all the Pranks he came from playing. <HI>Florange</HI>'s Fit went away, having la&s;ted full Fourteen Hours. He &s;ent for a Kin&s;man of his Wives, to whom he made his Complaints upon what had befallen him the Evening before, telling
<PB N="70" REF="42"> him, that he could not keep her after this. This man, who by chance, had read the <HI>Gazet</HI> in the morning, and knew be&s;ides that <HI>Florange</HI> had raved all the Night, imagin'd at his hearing him talk of <HI>Mainville,</HI> that he was &s;till in his raving Fit. Thus without an&s;wering to his Di&s;cour&s;e, he told him, that he was only to be fed with good Broths, that &s;o he might be brought to his right Sen&s;es, and his Head &s;etled. But <HI>Florange</HI> bur&s;ting out into anger; <HI>My Head,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>is too &s;ick ever to be &s;etled; and I wonder that you, who are my Relation, as well as Madam</HI> de Florange's, <HI>would make me believe, that I am a Vi&s;ionary fellow. You are &s;o in truth, if there ever was one,</HI> this Kin&s;man an&s;wer'd, <HI>to conceive a jealou&s;ie of a man, who at this hour is not perhaps alive.</HI> Mainville <HI>has been &s;ick a long time, and the &s;tate he is in, does with a Vengeance hinder him from thinking
<PB N="71" REF="42"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Wife. Take my Word, Cou|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, if you mean to fall out with her, u&s;e at lea&s;t a more probable pretext than this; for you'l have no body on your &s;ide, as long as you have this only to &s;ay against her.</HI> Thereupon the wonted Phy&s;ician entred, who had provided him&s;elf with a <HI>Gazet;</HI> and <HI>Florange</HI> go|ing to take him for Witne&s;s, that he affirm'd nothing but what was true, had the confu&s;ion to &s;ee him|&s;elf &s;till accus'd of raving. <HI>You think not of what you &s;ay, My Lord,</HI> &s;aid this Phy&s;ician to him; <HI>'tis the Remains of your Di&s;temper that make you talk in this manner: The Marquis</HI> de Mainville <HI>lies at the utmo&s;t extremity; and if he dies, it will be a great lo&s;s to his Fa|mily.</HI> Thereupon he took the <HI>Ga|zet</HI> out of his Pocket, and read a|loud the Article concerning this Marquis. After this he highly ex|toll'd his Noble Actions; adding, that he might have pu&s;h'd on his
<PB N="72" REF="43"> Fortune much farther, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> ha&s;ty a Death. <HI>Florange</HI>'s con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|on was great, after reading of the <HI>Gazet.</HI> He began to believe, that the violence of his Malady was the occa&s;ion of his Su&s;picions; and af|ter having more and more confirm'd him&s;elf in this Opinion, becau&s;e that his Kin&s;man, and the Phy|&s;ician, &s;till continued to tell him the &s;ame thing, at length he was &s;o well per&s;waded, that he ask d the former pardon for the Com|plaints he had made to him.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s had been thi|therto under extraordinary fear; but being inform'd by her Phy&s;ici|an, that her Hu&s;band began to re|pent of his having tax'd her, &s;he quickly di&s;mi&s;s'd her apprehen&s;i|ons. The re&s;t of the Summer was &s;pent without furni&s;hing her with any other Adventure; and her Hu&s;band being quite out of dan|ger, &s;he went along with him to their Countrey-hou&s;e. About the
<PB N="73" REF="43"> beginning of <HI>Autumn</HI> they took a journey to our Lady of <HI>Lie&s;&s;e,</HI> in acknowledgment of their Recove|ry; and Devotion having &s;pirited <HI>Mainville</HI> to go thither at his return from the Campaign, he accidental|ly met them as they were in the Church. <HI>Mainville</HI> made no &s;cru|ple of acco&s;ting <HI>Florange,</HI> twit|ting him with his going from <HI>Soi&s;|&s;ons</HI> without bidding him adieu. <HI>Florange</HI> was in a rage, that he was oblig'd to &s;uffer his Conver&s;ation: Thus he receiv'd him coldly: but <HI>Mainville</HI> having perceiv'd it, made as if he had urgent Bu&s;ine&s;s; in&s;o|much that he him&s;elf freed him out of perplexity, by re-mounting on Hor&s;e back. By this means he had not time to di&s;cour&s;e the Marchi|one&s;s; but his eyes finding her more beauteous than ever, they explain'd to her in one moment all that he had to &s;ay to her. After he was gone, <HI>Florange</HI> re-calling all his <HI>I|dea's</HI> into his memory, took it ill,
<PB N="74" REF="44"> that he &s;hould meet 'em &s;o pat at our Lady of <HI>Lie&s;&s;e.</HI> He imagin'd, that this could not fall out with|out his being advertiz'd; and in his heart he accus'd the Marchione&s;s of it. After having perform'd his Devotions in that Church, he re|turn'd to his own home, and on the Road &s;poke not &s;o much as one Word to his Wife; &s;o &s;pighted was he at this Adventure. When he was come thither, he entertain'd <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> with the Encounter he had had, and declar'd to him his Su&s;picions. <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> jump'd with him in his Opinion; but yet endeavour'd to undeceive him, that he might not expo&s;e the Marchio|ne&s;s to vexatious Reproaches. He was &s;till over Head and Ears in Love with her; in&s;omuch, that this Lady coming on her &s;ide to tell him, how Chance had brought <HI>Mainville</HI> and her to an Interview, when &s;he lea&s;t expected it. <HI>That was no hard matter, Madam,</HI> &s;aid
<PB N="75" REF="44"> he to her; <HI>and when one is of intel|ligence with chance, things &s;till more &s;urprizing happen out.</HI> The Marchi|one&s;s being amaz'd at the freedom he took of making her Reproaches, told him after a di&s;dainful manner, that it became indeed &s;uch a man as he to intermeddle in her con|cerns: That now &s;he plainly per|ceiv'd her mi&s;take, when &s;he thought him an hone&s;t man; and that all Servants return'd &s;ooner or later to their Character. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how di&s;mally the amorous <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was mortify'd with this word Servant. He had hither|to imagin'd he might one day come to touch the Marchione&s;s, if &s;he once came to make reflection of all he did for her: But lo&s;ing all hopes after this la&s;t in&s;tance of her Con|tempt, he left her with his heart full of rage. <HI>No, &s;he does not de|&s;erve,</HI> &s;aid he to him&s;elf, <HI>the e&s;teem of a worthy man: She's a meer Co|quet, that's won by a gaudy out|&s;ide;
<PB N="76" REF="45"> and I ought to indulge my Re|venge, unle&s;s I mean to pa&s;s for the most faint-hearted of all Lovers.

<P>As <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was entertain|ing him&s;elf with this Di&s;cour&s;e, and much other &s;tuff of the like Na|ture, that expre&s;s'd the exce&s;s of his Re&s;entment, word was brought him, that a man enquir'd for him; and going to &s;ee who it was, it was found to be a Per&s;on from <HI>Main|ville.</HI></P>
<P>This Marquis had made a &s;top at <HI>Villers-Cotterets,</HI> whence he had writ|ten
<PB N="77" REF="45"> to his Mi&s;tre&s;s. His Me&s;&s;enger having pre&s;ented his Letter to <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> be&s;ought him to make an an&s;wer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to his Ma&s;ter. <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> re|turn'd a moment after, and told the Me&s;&s;enger, that <HI>Mainville</HI> might come about midnight, and that he &s;hould find the Park-door open: That the Marchione&s;s had not had time to write to him; but that this was &s;ufficient. This man made ha&s;te to return; and when half way, he met <HI>Mainville,</HI> who was &s;o impatient to know if the Marchio|ne&s;s would accept of a Rendez|vouze, that he required of her by his Letter, that he was mounted on Hor&s;e-back, to avail him&s;elf of it the &s;ooner. This Me&s;&s;enger gave him an account of what <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had &s;aid to him; but at the &s;ame time adviz'd him to turn back, &s;aying, that he &s;eem'd to be in a &s;trange Concern when he gave him his An&s;wer; and that either he was
<PB N="78" REF="46"> mi&s;taken, or that it was not &s;afe to tru&s;t to his Word. <HI>Mainville</HI> made a mock of his fear, and continued on his way. But this Me&s;&s;enger was not &s;o much mi&s;taken as <HI>Main|ville</HI> imagin'd. For indeed <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> finding that this occa&s;ion was favourable to revenge him&s;elf of the Marchione&s;&s;es &s;lights, had car|ry'd <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Letter to <HI>Florange,</HI> in the fir&s;t Heat of his Re&s;entment, letting him by that &s;ee that his Su&s;|picions were not over-ill grounded. Neverthele&s;s, he was cautious of telling him, that he was the Party that had carry'd on the Intrigues of the&s;e Lovers to the point it was at. Far from this, he made him believe, that this Letter was fallen by chance into his hands; and that he had no &s;ooner &s;een what it con|tain'd, but that he had deliver'd it to him.</P>
<P><HI>Florange</HI> being a&s;certain'd of his Di&s;honour, or at lea&s;t, that he was robb'd of his Wife's Heart, did not
<PB N="79" REF="46"> he&s;itate one moment, as to being reveng'd. He, with <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> re&s;olv'd to &s;urprize <HI>Mainville</HI> in his Wife's Chamber, and &s;acrifice them both to his Re&s;entment. In the mean time <HI>Mainville</HI> &s;till advanc'd, not in the lea&s;t dreaming of what was brewing again&s;t him. He found the Park-door open, as <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had &s;ent him word, and &s;lipping between a Pali&s;ade, he got to the Hou&s;e-door, which was half open. <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> the better to make him fall into the Trap that was laid for him, had not only de&s;crib'd the Hou&s;e to the Me&s;&s;enger, but had likewi&s;e pro|mis'd to &s;tand behind this la&s;t Door, whence he was to convey <HI>Mainville</HI> into the Marchione&s;&s;es Room. He had likewi&s;e told this Lady, that <HI>Mainville</HI> was to come to her, that &s;he might leave her Door open. Her eagerne&s;s to &s;ee him again, had made her fall into the Snare, with|out requiring other a&s;&s;urance than
<PB N="80" REF="47"> <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s Word. When <HI>Main|ville</HI> was come to the Hou&s;e-door, he really found this Dome&s;tick, who conducted him as far as the Marchi|one&s;&s;es Room, who&s;e Door he found. <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> after that, withdrew; but by a &s;urprizing Re|collection, he, who only breath'd Revenge, &s;ince the Marchione&s;s had treated him ill, found him&s;elf mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, revolving in his mind the unhappy Condition to which &s;he was going to be reduc'd. In &s;hort, his Love got the upper|hand in a moment. His Eyes were all bath'd in Tears, out of Grief for having been the Cau&s;e of &s;o lovely a Per&s;on's Death; and in a word, if nothing was to do, but to give her the very la&s;t Drop of his Blood, to repair what he had done, he would willingly have gi|ven it.</P>
<P>In the mean while he was to give an An&s;wer to <HI>Florange,</HI> who had planted him&s;elf behind a Pali|&s;ade
<PB N="81" REF="47"> of Maple to &s;ee <HI>Mainville</HI> pa&s;s. This Hu&s;band had heard him as he &s;lipt by between the Trees: Nay, and had &s;een him; in|&s;omuch, that growing weary of &s;taying any longer in that place, &s;ince it was time to come to &s;la&s;h|ing, he went his way, to know what detain'd <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> from coming to give him notice. He found this Unfortunate Dome&s;tick Twenty Paces from his Ambu&s;cade; and having ask'd him, whether he had conducted <HI>Mainville</HI> above Stairs, he made an&s;wer, No; and that he mu&s;t needs have fail'd the A&s;&s;ignation. <HI>Prethee, why that up|on me,</HI> reply'd <HI>Florange</HI> in anger; <HI>for I &s;aw him pa&s;s by where I was.</HI> At the&s;e words he would have gone up into the Marchione&s;&s;es Cham|ber; but <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> &s;topping him by the Arm, told him, that his going might cau&s;e him to mi&s;s his aim; that it was convenient for him to go up fir&s;t, to &s;ee if <HI>Main|ville</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="48"> was there; that he would come and give him an account at the bottom of the Stairs; and that afterwards it would be for him not to lo&s;e the occa&s;ion of being re|veng'd. <HI>Florange,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing the greatne&s;s of the Offence, could not yet put off a certain I ear that was natural to him. Thus being willing that any other than him&s;elf &s;hould make the fir&s;t Pa|ces, he comply'd with all <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> propos'd, and &s;taid for him at the bottom of the Stairs. <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> &s;eeing this, mounted above, without lo&s;ing of time; and ha|ving caus'd the Door to be open'd, he extreamly &s;urpriz'd the&s;e Lo|vers, when he told them all was ruin'd. Being &s;eiz'd with Fear, they ask'd him what had fallen out: But <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> more un|done than they, made an&s;wer, that it was not a time to hold long Di&s;cour&s;es, and that <HI>Mainville</HI> mu&s;t be gone at the very in&s;tant, if he
<PB N="83" REF="48"> meant to be alive a Quarter of an Hour after. That he would find <HI>Florange</HI> at the bottom of the Stair|ca&s;e; and that to pa&s;s &s;afely, he mu&s;t counterfeit his Voice, and tell him, that now is the time for you to be reveng'd. That he could &s;ay nothing more to him at pre&s;ent, and that another time he would un|ravel this my&s;tery unto him.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he took <HI>Main|ville</HI> by the Arm, to &s;hove him out, conjuring him to make his e&s;cape, and at the &s;ame time to &s;ave the Marchione&s;&s;es Honour and Life. As this Di&s;cour&s;e was too pre&s;&s;ing to lo&s;e time in deliberation, he did not &s;tand upon much entreaty: Down &s;tole he as &s;oftly as he could, holding by the Rails, and finding <HI>Florange</HI> at the bottom, who &s;topp'd him, he whi&s;per'd in his Ear what <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had &s;aid to him. <HI>Florange</HI> heard tho&s;e words di&s;tinctly, but did not know his Voice; in&s;omuch, that think|ing
<PB N="84" REF="49"> to find <HI>Mainville</HI> above, he mounted ha&s;tily, breathing no|thing but Revenge. <HI>Mainville</HI> had left the Marchione&s;&s;es Chamber-Door open, and <HI>Florange</HI> entring therein, with a Pi&s;tol in one Hand, and a Sword in the other, he &s;ought for <HI>Mainville,</HI> as the fir&s;t Victim he ought to offer up to his Re&s;ent|ment. He was much amaz'd to &s;ee only <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> leaning again&s;t a Table, and the Marchione&s;s on the other &s;ide, not having the power to &s;upport her &s;elf. <HI>Where am I,</HI> cry'd he at this &s;ight, <HI>and what's become of</HI> Mainville? <HI>Speak</HI> Grand-Champ: <HI>did you not tell me he was here, and coming up after me, how came you to be in this Chamber? Grand Champ</HI> being prepar'd for all that <HI>Florange</HI> could &s;ay to him, and re&s;olv'd to &s;ave the Marchione&s;&s;es Life at the expence of his own, look'd upon him fixedly, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing his Speech to him: <HI>Kill me, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>&s;ince
<PB N="85" REF="49"> I have de&s;erved Death: I am the greate&s;t Cheat of all men, in having fal&s;ely accus'd my Lady. I have made you conceive a fal&s;e Opinion of her Vertue, by forging to you a Letter from</HI> Mainville, <HI>to induce you to u&s;e her ill: And what is &s;till beyond all this, is, that Love is the occa&s;ion of all the&s;e Crimes. There is not any other man, &s;ave I,</HI> conti|nued he, <HI>that had any intentions to &s;educe her: And if I had brought them about, I &s;hould not have been &s;o enrag'd, to undertake to make you &s;hed a Blood that ought to be &s;o dear to you. I now perceive my fault; and to puni&s;h me for it, you need only to pierce my Bo&s;ome.</HI> At the &s;ame time he pre&s;ented him&s;elf be|fore him, offering him&s;elf to a vo|luntary Death: But <HI>Florange</HI> not being able to reconcile the&s;e Words with what had been told him at the bottom of the Stair-ca&s;e; <HI>Do you kill me,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>or free me out of pain, by acquainting me, how
<PB N="86" REF="50"> you came hither before me, and what is become of him that &s;poke to me before that I came up. No body can have &s;poke to you,</HI> reply'd <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> faintly; <HI>and through a pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Pa&s;&s;ion, you imagin'd you heard what no body can have &s;aid to you. The &s;incere confe&s;&s;ion I have made t' ye of my fault, ought to convince you of it: for I would not expo&s;e my &s;elf to your Re&s;entment for an other. It is I alone that am culpable; and Madam</HI> de Florange, <HI>and the Marquis</HI> de Mainville <HI>are in|nocent.</HI></P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s at fir&s;t could not imagine the meaning of all this; but beginning to apprehend &s;omething, &s;he broke &s;ilence, to complain of her Husband's Su&s;pici|ons, as if he had really been migh|tily in the wrong, to doubt of her Vertue. So as that poor <HI>Florange</HI> being in De&s;pondency at &s;o extra|ordinary an Adventure, withdrew into his own Apartment, without
<PB N="87" REF="50"> having the power to take any Re|&s;olution. After this <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> made the Marchione&s;s a &s;incere Confe&s;&s;ion of his fault; and as he was penetrated with regret, he would in her pre&s;ence have run him&s;elf through with his Sword; telling her, that he could no longer live, after having &s;o mortally of|fended her. But the Marchione&s;s leaping upon him, hinder'd him from executing his fatal Re&s;oluti|on, and promis'd him never to call his Crime to mind. <HI>I &s;hall have it in mind, Madam,</HI> an&s;wered he, <HI>all my life long; but now it &s;hall not be &s;o long, &s;o as I may weary my &s;elf much in the World.</HI> At the&s;e words he went out of her Chamber after a de&s;perate &s;ort of manner, and without con&s;idering that it was Night, he took the fir&s;t way he found, and did not &s;top till it was day. The Marquis <HI>de Mainville</HI> had taken exactly the &s;ame Road, and Fortune would have it, that
<PB N="88" REF="51"> they &s;hould both alight in the &s;ame Inn. <HI>Mainville</HI> had newly di&s;|patch'd away a man to <HI>Florange</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, to know what had occur'd there after his departure; but &s;ee|ing that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> could inform him the be&s;t of any body, he de|&s;ir'd him, that he would free him out of pain, and tell him all he did not know. <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> to &s;a|tisfy his Curio&s;ity, gave him a long account of the Marchione&s;&s;es &s;light, and of the revenge he de&s;ign'd up|on her: and continuing the re&s;t of his Story, he acquainted him how when upon the point of &s;acrifi|cing them both, his Love for the Marchione&s;s had &s;av'd them. <HI>Alas!</HI> then cry'd <HI>Mainville, I &s;hould ne|ver have &s;u&s;pected you of Treachery. On the contrary, I had &s;o much con|fidence in you, that I have ju&s;t now &s;ent a Letter to you for the Marchio|ne&s;s. &V;nhappy that I am; I have perhaps de&s;troy'd your labour: You had &s;et her Husband's mind to rights
<PB N="89" REF="51"> by your Addre&s;s; or at lea&s;t, you had left him in an uncertainty of his mis|fortune; and my imprudence has &s;poyl'd All.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had told his Story after &s;o unconcern'd a manner, that he &s;eem'd now a Party indifferent; but hearing to what danger <HI>Main|ville</HI> had expos'd the Marchione&s;s, he &s;eem'd to recover new Senti|ments. <HI>You are really very unhap|py,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>in cau&s;ing &s;o much trouble to a Lady, who would ever have been innocent, had &s;he ne|ver known you. I ought neverthe|le&s;s to be glad, that &s;he has occa&s;ion to complain of you, that &s;o &s;he may forget you: But as in this occa&s;ion her All is at &s;take, I &s;hall here wait for the return of your man, that &s;o if he has put your Letter into any other hands than hers, I may &s;till render her a piece of Service.</HI> He had no &s;ooner &s;poke the&s;e words, but in came that man, being a Pea&s;ant that <HI>Mainville</HI> had been forc'd to
<PB N="90" REF="52"> employ, as having none of his own Servants with him, to whom he could give this Commi&s;&s;ion. They ask'd him both at the &s;ame time, what was become of the Letter; and the Bumpkin an&s;wer'd them, that he had giv'n it to <HI>Grand-Champ. What &s;ort of man is he,</HI> cry'd <HI>Mainville</HI> immediately, all in De&s;pair at his mi&s;take? <HI>He is tall,</HI> reply'd the Pea&s;ant, <HI>well made, and very neat.</HI> He then gave an ac|count of the Per&s;on to whom he had deliver'd his Letter; and <HI>Main|ville</HI> and <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> knew plain|ly by his Pourtraict of him, that it was fall'n into <HI>Florange</HI>'s Hands. Thereupon <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> entreat|ed <HI>Mainville</HI> to lend him his Hor&s;e; for he was come a-foot; telling him, that he was going to pay the Marchione&s;s the la&s;t Service he &s;hould pay her as long as he liv'd. <HI>Mainville</HI> gave him his Hor&s;e; and <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> u&s;ing di&s;patch, re|pair'd to the Hou&s;e of a Pea&s;ant of
<PB N="91" REF="52"> <HI>Florange</HI>'s Village, and there wrote a Letter. He then encharg'd the Pea&s;ant with it, with order to put it into the Marchione&s;&s;es own Hands, as a thing of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence. This Pea&s;ant did dexterou&s;ly acquit him&s;elf of his Commi&s;&s;ion; &s;o as that the Mar|chione&s;s was advertiz'd of the fault <HI>Mainville</HI> had committed, and to make timely Provi&s;ion for her &s;elf.</P>
<P>She receiv'd this Advice ju&s;t in the nick: for her Husband de&s;ign|ing to convict her of her Intrigue from her own writing, had newly caus'd <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Letter to be deli|ver'd to her under hand, not doubt|ing but that &s;he would make an An&s;wer to it. And indeed &s;he had already Ink and Paper to do it, when that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s Letter made her change her &s;tile. In&s;tead of writing to <HI>Mainville,</HI> as &s;he was going to do, &s;he writ to her Husband; and leaving the Letter
<PB N="92" REF="53"> upon her Table, &s;he went to find out <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> whom &s;he en|treated to accompany her to one of her Relations, whither &s;he had a De&s;ign to withdraw. <HI>Grand Champ</HI> did not &s;tick to grant her the Crup|per of his Hor&s;e, and convoy'd her till &s;uch time as that he had put her into a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Florange</HI> was as impatient to hear of his Wife's Commerce, as if it had been &s;ome good news he was to receive. Thus &s;eeing that &s;he delay'd her An&s;wer too long, he &s;ent her the Fellow he had caus'd to deliver <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Letter to her, to inform her, that &s;he was to make more ha&s;te. This man found her Chamber-door o|pen; and having &s;een upon the Ta|ble the Letter &s;he had left there, he carry'd it to <HI>Florange,</HI> as thinking it to be the &s;ame he expected. <HI>Flo|range</HI> open'd it ha&s;tily. But what a wonderful amazement, when in|&s;tead of what he expected to find
<PB N="93" REF="53"> therein, he met with a thou&s;and Reproaches. She accus'd him a|mong other things, of having him|&s;elf contriv'd the Letter &s;he had receiv'd from <HI>Mainville;</HI> and he could not convict her of the con|trary, becau&s;e he knew not this Marquis his Hand. She al&s;o ac|quainted him whither &s;he was gone, adding, that &s;he would no longer live with a man that us'd her rather like a Tyrant than a Hus|band.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Florange</HI> knew him&s;elf innocent, and that far from being di&s;abus'd of his Wife's Intrigue, he every day thought her more cri|minal, yet could he not hear of her Departure without grief. He &s;u&s;pected that &s;he was gone to tax his Carriage, and that having no Proofs to convict her, her Com|plaints would prevail in the Minds of her Relations o're tho&s;e he might make of her ill Conduct.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="54">
<P>Thus &s;eeing that he had taken his mea&s;ures ill, he did not waver to go &s;eek her out, and took Coach in that De&s;ign with his Wife's. Wo|man, whom he little &s;u&s;pected of being privy to her Concerns: For &s;he was a Go&s;&s;ip, that under the Oloak of Devotion knew admira|bly well how to play her Part. He que&s;tion'd her however on the Road, whether &s;he knew any thing of the matters in agitation; But &s;he affected a fal&s;e Hypocri&s;y, meaning to per&s;wade him of the Marchione&s;&s;es Hone&s;ty: and that be&s;ides, &s;he was not a Girl to be concern'd in an Intrigue. When they were Two Leagues from the place they came, a Hor&s;e of his lo&s;t his &s;hooes, and they were fore'd to halt, to have him &s;hoo'd again. <HI>Florange</HI> was al&s;o a little &s;icki&s;h, which oblig'd him to go into an Inn to drink a little Wine. While this pa&s;s'd, the Waiting-Gentlewoman, who had alighted
<PB N="95" REF="54"> out of the Coach, &s;aw a Compa|ny of People flocking together at the end of the Village; and be|ing naturally curious, as all Wo|men commonly are, &s;he went on that waywards, to inquire into the matter. When &s;he was come thi|ther, &s;he was told a thing &s;ome|what extraordinary; namely, that a man after having alighted at an Inn, had &s;ent back his Hor&s;e four Leagues thence, to a per&s;on of whom he had borrow'd it; that afterwards he had put him&s;elf to Bed, pretending he was &s;ick, and had &s;ent for a Chyrurgeon, who had let him Blood; but that this Chyrurgeon was no &s;ooner gone, but that he had him&s;elf unty'd his Arm; and that in &s;hort, he had &s;hed &s;o great a quantity of Blood, that there were no more hopes of his Life.</P>
<P>The Novelty of the thing re|doubled this Womans Curio&s;ity; and &s;o much the more, as know|ing
<PB N="96" REF="55"> that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had condu|cted her Lady upon the Crupper of <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Hor&s;e, &s;he had great Su&s;picions it might be him all this Di&s;cour&s;e was of. Thus &s;he re|&s;olv'd her&s;elf to &s;ee whether &s;he was not mi&s;taken, that &s;o &s;he might afterwards give the Marchione&s;s a faithful account. As &s;oon as &s;he had ca&s;t her eyes upon that Wretch, &s;he really knew him to be the wretched <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> who was in a very bad Condition. He on his &s;ide was not wanting to know her again immediately; and de&s;i|ring the People to withdraw, as being to di&s;cour&s;e her in private. <HI>I die,</HI> he &s;aid to her, <HI>the most con|tented of all men, &s;ince that For|tune, which hitherto had been again&s;t me, now favours me with your Com|pany, when that I lea&s;t expected it, to be the Witne&s;s of my la&s;t Words. You may tell Madam</HI> de Florange, <HI>that I have my &s;elf advanc'd my Death, as after her &s;lights not being
<PB N="97" REF="55"> able to &s;urvive. Perhaps that one day &s;he will regret &s;o faithful a Lo|ver. Be it as it will, I only wi&s;h her happine&s;s.</HI> At the&s;e Words a Convul&s;ion Fit &s;eiz'd him; and the Dam&s;el being willing that he &s;hould die in other Hands than hers, call'd for the People again into his Room; and while they were bu&s;y in con|templating this Unfortunate Lo|ver, &s;he made away through the Crowd, without notice be|ing taken of what was become of her.</P>
<P><HI>Florange</HI>'s fainting Fit had kept all his Servants about him, and hinder'd them from knowing what pa&s;s'd, which their Ladies Woman was not &s;orry for, becau&s;e that it was to be feared, that if <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s Adventure had come to his Ma&s;ter's knowledg, he would have gone and di&s;cours'd him, and that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> would have told him all, for the di&s;charge of his Con&s;cience. In fine, after that
<PB N="98" REF="56"> <HI>Florange</HI> had re-collected his Spi|rits, he took Coach again with her, and they came to the Place of the Marchione&s;&s;es Retreat. <HI>Flo|range</HI> made great Complaints to their Kin&s;man, that his Wife went &s;o away without &s;aying a word to him: But the Kin&s;man being prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with what the Mar|chione&s;s had told him in her Vin|dication, an&s;wer'd him, that being of &s;uch an Humour, he ought not to marry, &s;ince there was nothing that madded a Vertuous Woman more, than when her Husband doubted her Vertue. <HI>For my part,</HI> added he, <HI>I &s;hall never advi&s;e her to return with you, at lea&s;t, unle&s;s you expre&s;s a mighty regret for what is pa&s;s'd. Florange</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf baffled in this manner, would have &s;poke of two Letters he had re|ceiv'd; but his Kin&s;man reply'd upon him, that if that was all he had to alledg again&s;t her, he might be gone as he came, and that all his
<PB N="99" REF="56"> own Relations would e&s;pou&s;e the Defence of his Wife. Thus was <HI>Florange</HI> forc'd to ask his Wife's Pardon, though in his Soul he knew that the fault lay not at his door.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Florange</HI> having need of the Protection of this Relation in many things, and particularly in this occa&s;ion, wherein it was requi|&s;ite to ju&s;tify her Conduct, of which it was impo&s;&s;ible to hinder Di&s;|cour&s;e in the World, after what had newly happen'd, did after this ea&s;ily comply with the Coun&s;el he gave her, of coming to a Recon|ciliation with her Husband. They &s;taid the re&s;t of the Day at his Hou&s;e, and all the next; and <HI>Flo|range</HI> being gone out for a moment, the Waiting-Gentlewoman took the time of his ab&s;ence to entertain her Lady with the &s;ad Adventure of the Unfortunate <HI>Grand-Champ.</HI> The Marchione&s;s could not retain her Tears at &s;o piteous a Relation, and
<PB N="100" REF="57"> joyning &s;ome Regrets to the Tears &s;he had &s;hed, &s;he told her Woman, that he merited a better Fortune. This Di&s;cour&s;e &s;urpriz'd that Maid, as knowing how much &s;he had de|&s;pis'd him as long as he liv'd, in&s;o|much that &s;he could not hide her amazement from her. But the Mar|chione&s;s interrupting her, accus'd her of having an ill Opinion of her, &s;ince that after all the In&s;tances of Love thar <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> had given her, &s;he could not, at lea&s;t, with|out being the mo&s;t ungrateful per|&s;on in the World, hear that any ill was befallen him without being griev'd. <HI>This is a tardy gratitude, Madam,</HI> the Dam&s;el then cry'd, <HI>and you would have oblig'd him much more, if you had &s;hewn it while he was well. I have ever had a &s;ence for him,</HI> reply'd the Mar|chione&s;s, <HI>but could not then &s;hew it without hampering my &s;elf in trou|bles.</HI> Mainville <HI>would have been jea|lous, and perhaps that thinking me
<PB N="101" REF="57"> in love with</HI> Grand-Champ, <HI>he would have &s;ought out a Con&s;olation for my incon&s;tancy, in the choice of an other Mi&s;tre&s;s. That is to &s;ay, Madam,</HI> the Dam&s;el an&s;wer'd, <HI>that you lov'd poor</HI> Grand-Champ, <HI>but did not love him &s;o well as</HI> Mainville. <HI>How di&s;|&s;embling are Women! I thought you as nice as any per&s;on living in your Love: Neverthele&s;s by what I per|ceive, you prefer Number before Deli|cacy.</HI> It is very &s;eldom known that a Woman dare talk in &s;uch a man|ner to her Lady; but &s;ee what a Confident may do: and I fancy, that if this Maid had been le&s;s in|form'd of her Concerns, &s;he would have been more cautious in her words. Be it as it will, Madam <HI>de Florange</HI> imagining &s;he might &s;uffer, &s;hould &s;he leave her in the&s;e Sentiments, <HI>You mistake me in what I have &s;aid,</HI> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <HI>and you gro&s;ly confound Love and Acknow|ledgment. There is neverthele&s;s a great deal of difference between the
<PB N="102" REF="58"> One and the Other. The Motions of Love are tender and pa&s;&s;ionate Mo|tions, excited by Sympathy: whereas tho&s;e of Gratitude are only ordinary Movements, that are wont to ari&s;e from &s;ome Benefit that one has re|ceiv'd. But, Madam,</HI> reply'd the Dam&s;el, <HI>if tho&s;e Motions which Gra|titude excites, are &s;o common as you &s;ay, they ought not, methinks, to oc|ca&s;ion the &s;hedding of &s;o many tears; and yet this is what you do. Tell me, I be&s;eech you, how this comes to pa&s;s: for I fancy'd, that People affli|cted them&s;elves in &s;uch manner on|ly when they were lively affected. This you are mi&s;taken in,</HI> reply'd the Marchione&s;s, <HI>as you were but a mo|ment agoe, when you confounded Gratitude and Love. A great grief never appears &s;o much outwardly as does a mean one: and one would have a bad Opinion of the &s;en&s;ibility of a Per&s;on, that &s;hould &s;hed tears at the newne&s;s of a great misfortune. One mu&s;t remain &s;eiz'd till that time di|mini&s;hing
<PB N="103" REF="58"> the &s;trength of the grief, leaves to man his wonted Functions. Then it is that the Eyes di&s;till them|&s;elves into Water, as a mark of his Affliction. If I do not make my &s;elf well under&s;tood,</HI> added the Marchio|ne&s;s, <HI>I am going to give thee a very familiar Compari&s;on: Thou know'&s;t that Cold, when it is extream, clo|&s;es all things, and principally Rivers, who&s;e cour&s;e remains conceal'd by rea|&s;on of the Ice that appears upon the Surface of the Waters. It is even the &s;ame thing with a great Grief in the Heart of Man. His Tears are &s;topt; and as the Current of Ri|vers only appears when the Cold is di|mini&s;h'd, &s;o his Eyes only &s;hed Tears when the Affliction is no longer &s;o &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons the Mar|chione&s;s gave her Woman, to make her apprehend, that &s;he might be|wail: <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s misfortunes, without loving him. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he bid her enquire after him, when
<PB N="104" REF="59"> that they pa&s;s'd by where &s;he had left him. That &s;he needed only to feign &s;ome need to alight out of the Coach, and that &s;he might take that time to do what &s;he bid her. The Morning being come, they all &s;et forwards on their Jour|ney, and the Dam&s;el having per|form'd her Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;he was told, that <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> was dead but a moment before. She acquaint|ed her Lady with it when they were arriv'd; and the&s;e Tidings renew'd her grief.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Occurrences, the Marchione&s;s had an Affliction which much more affected her than <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s Death. <HI>Mainville</HI> remain'd Two Months without writing to her; and &s;he did not doubt after &s;uch great marks of his forgetful|ne&s;s, but that he had got &s;ome new Mi&s;tre&s;s. She daily complain'd to her Woman of her misfortune, and of Mens Incon&s;tancy. <HI>They are all ungrateful,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her, <HI>and the
<PB N="105" REF="59"> Ladies are fools for loving them. Their flames lact only just &s;o long as they find &s;atisfaction therein; and as fondne&s;s only encrea&s;es by de&s;ires, as &s;oon as the&s;e de&s;ires are fulfill'd, the&s;e fondne&s;&s;es quickly become little or nothing. They never &s;ee you af|terwards, but out of a luke-warm|ne&s;s: nay, nor would they &s;ee you at all, were they not afraid of being tax'd with ill-breeding. I leave thee to judge what a Lady can &s;ay after this; and if being wonted, as &s;he is, to the Movements of a tender and a pa&s;&s;ionate Love, &s;he re&s;ts &s;atisfy'd with the&s;e Civility-Vi&s;its.</HI> Mainville, <HI>the ungrateful</HI> Mainville, continu'd &s;he, <HI>is not exempt from the&s;e weak|ne&s;&s;es; and thou &s;ee&s;t after all that I have done for him, what his ingrati|tude is.</HI></P>
<P>Though <HI>Mainville</HI> paid the Dam|&s;el well for being in his Intere&s;ts, &s;he mo&s;t commonly dur&s;t not take his part, finding her &s;elf, that he was mightily to blame in that he did
<PB N="106" REF="60"> not write to her. However, being unwilling utterly to abandon him, &s;he endeavour'd to give her Lady &s;till &s;ome hopes, telling her one while, that his Letters might mi&s;|carry, another, that he was &s;ick, and that otherwi&s;e &s;he would have heard of him. But the Marchio|ne&s;s did not &s;uffer her &s;elf to be &s;o ea&s;ily impos'd on: She knew that a Man of <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Quality &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger on purpo&s;e, when Two Po&s;ts had fail'd him; and that let a Man be never &s;o &s;ick, he never forgets his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>About that time Fame, which carries throughout the whole Earth the Actions of Great Men, blaz'd about, that <HI>Mainville</HI> had &s;igna|liz'd him&s;elf above all others in a Battel. At the&s;e Newes the Mar|chione&s;s, who was as &s;en&s;ible to Honour as any Woman in the World, found her tenderne&s;s to re|vive. The Re&s;entment &s;he had of her Lover's forgetfulne&s;s, had made
<PB N="107" REF="60"> her di&s;continue writing to him: She then took Pen and Ink, to ex|pre&s;s to him the &s;atisfaction &s;he had in his Heroick Performances. Ne|verthele&s;s &s;he mingled &s;oft and ten|der Reproaches with the Prai&s;es &s;he be&s;tow'd upon his fine Actions; in&s;omuch, that one might &s;ay, that her Letter was both a Letter of Love and of Civility. <HI>Mainville</HI> was exactly of the Humour of tho&s;e People the Marchione&s;s had de|&s;crib'd to her Woman; too ea&s;y Conque&s;ts became flat to him, and he had been for &s;ome time di&s;gu&s;ted becau&s;e &s;he had done too much for him. But Two Months Ab&s;ence making him look upon her then as a New Mi&s;tre&s;s, he renew'd writing to her in very pa&s;&s;ionate Terms, &s;eeking &s;orry Excu&s;es to colour the little Con&s;ideration he had &s;hewn for her. The Weakne&s;s of People in Love, is &s;o extraordinary, that the Marchione&s;s was &s;atisfy'd with his Rea&s;ons, as if they had been
<PB N="108" REF="61"> good. Thus their Intrigue was re|new'd as before, and all as much charm'd with one another as they had ever been; they let not a Po&s;t &s;lip without interchanging of Letters.</P>
<P>This Commerce la&s;ted during the re&s;t of the Campaign; and being ready to end, <HI>Florange</HI> being at <HI>Paris</HI> upon a Law-Suit, and &s;u&s;pe|cting that <HI>Mainville</HI> writ to his Wife, repair'd to his own Home, to hinder him from &s;eeing her at his re|turn from the Army. His Precau|tion was &s;omewhat nece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e that <HI>Mainville</HI> was really re|&s;olv'd to &s;ee her on his way. Yet was it in vain: for though <HI>Main|ville</HI> knew him to be at home, as he would have been &s;orry to have come &s;o near to no purpo&s;e, he di&s;|guis'd him&s;elf, as a Miller's Boy, to &s;ee his Wife. This being done, he mounted upon a Mule, with &s;eve|ral Sacks under him; and in this E|quipage came to the Court of the
<PB N="109" REF="61"> Ca&s;tle one day that he knew him out a hunting.</P>
<P>He was inform'd, that it was the Marchione&s;&s;es Woman that caus'd the Corn to be mea&s;ur'd before her, and who receiv'd the Meal; &s;o as that he fancy'd it would be no hard matter to make him&s;elf known. But this Nymph little dreaming, that the Marquis <HI>de Mainville</HI> was become a Miller's Boy, began, without look|ing him much in the Face, to rattle him, for that his Ma&s;ter had not the time before re&s;tor'd all the Meal he ought to deliver: That is to &s;ay, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that &s;he accus'd him of being a little Thievi&s;h. <HI>Main|ville</HI> laugh'd heartily in him&s;elf at her mi&s;take; but referring till an o|ther time to rally her for it, he got up to her to pre&s;s her Hand, thinking, that after that &s;he would no longer take him for a Miller. But the Dam|&s;el, far from gue&s;&s;ing what that meant, call'd him in&s;olent Ra&s;cal; which made all the People flock a|bout
<PB N="110" REF="62"> him, beginning to threaten him. Then the Dam&s;el viewing him more earne&s;tly, and perceiving the fault &s;he had committed, &s;he was at a very great lo&s;s how to re|pair it: for now was it a little too late, all People flocking to &s;ee the Miller. The Marchione&s;s acciden|tally return'd from walking, and having enquir'd why all her People ran that waywards, &s;he was told the occa&s;ion, and going that way her &s;elf, her &s;urpri&s;e was extream, when &s;he knew <HI>Mainville.</HI> Never|thele&s;s, without making any thing known of her amazement, &s;he &s;aid, that he ought to be &s;hut up, and that when her Husband was return'd from hunting, he &s;hould order what he deem'd fitting for his Puni&s;hment. Her pre&s;ence of Mind was admirable in this occa&s;ion; for &s;he freed him by the&s;e means out of her Servants Hands, &s;ome of whom might other|wi&s;e have known him.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="62">
<P>Thus was he led into a Tower ap|pointed for Criminals; but he was no &s;ooner there, than that the Dam|&s;el came to fetch him thence, to con|vey him to her Ladies Feet. He there forgot the Fright he had been in, when he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded with all <HI>Florange</HI>'s Dome&s;ticks. The&s;e Two Lovers upbraided one another tenderly, for having been &s;o long without writing to each o|ther; and Love largely rewarded them for the pains it had made them &s;uffer. However, after &s;everal &s;oft|ne&s;&s;es it became <HI>Mainville</HI> to think of being gone; for <HI>Florange</HI> was every moment expected, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hun his Pre&s;ence. The Marchione&s;s was the fir&s;t to mind him of it, and he was &s;o charm'd with her Pre&s;ence, that it was quite out of his thoughts. But con&s;ider|ing his Dre&s;s, his getting off was difficult: for a Servant might &s;ee him go out, and he would not have fail'd of &s;topping him, thinking he
<PB N="112" REF="63"> did a fine Job. The Marchione&s;&s;es Woman &s;eeing their perplexity, of|fer'd to give him a Suit of her Cloaths, &s;aying, that &s;ince &s;he had done all the mi&s;chief, it was but Ju|&s;tice that &s;he &s;hould bring a Reme|dy. <HI>Mainville</HI> willingly receiv'd her Offers; and knowing that he &s;hould find his Mule at the Park-Gate, he took leave of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, after having a&s;&s;ur'd her of a Love-Proof again&s;t all things.</P>
<P>He took his way along a Wood, that reaches from the Park of <HI>Flo|range</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, to a &s;mall Village, but half a League thence. So far went he without any ill Encounter. But when he was beyond it, he met with <HI>Florange,</HI> who was unhappily re|turning from hunting. The other Hunters had taken through an other way, and <HI>Florange</HI> was all alone, ei|ther in meditating on the Plea&s;ure he had that day taken in hunting, or perchance in thinking on &s;ome|thing el&s;e that was not &s;o agreeable.
<PB N="113" REF="63"> No &s;ooner did <HI>Mainville</HI> perceive him, but that he &s;ought to get out of his way; but <HI>Florange</HI> having by chance ca&s;t his Eyes on that &s;ide, fancy'd him, by his Garb, to be his Wife's Woman, and in that Opini|on he ran full &s;peed to him. As &s;oon as he had overtaken him, he ask'd him, whither &s;he was a going: for <HI>Mainville</HI> being mask'd, he &s;till took it to be the &s;ame Per&s;on. <HI>Mainville</HI> made him an&s;wer, that he was mi|&s;taken, and that not knowing him, &s;he did not think her &s;elf oblig'd to give him an account of her actions. <HI>If you do not know me,</HI> then <HI>Florange</HI> reply'd, <HI>you are certainly a Thief, &s;ince that this Rigging belongs to my Wife's Woman. I took you at fir&s;t for her, but I now perceive that I am mi&s;taken. I am neither the one nor the other,</HI> Mainville reply'd, <HI>and you are mi|&s;taken in the Cloaths as well as in the Per&s;on. Be advis'd by me, pur&s;ue your way, without in&s;ulting me any longer; otherwi&s;e you may pay for your
<PB N="114" REF="64"> intru&s;ion. I am content,</HI> reply'd <HI>Florange; but fir&s;t unmask your &s;elf, that I may judge by your face, whether I am mi&s;taken or not. Mainville</HI> was far from doing it; in&s;omuch, that <HI>Florange,</HI> who never was civil in his Life, &s;eeing that he excus'd it, &s;et him&s;elf to &s;natch off his Mask.</P>
<P><HI>Mainville</HI> went not to his Amo|rous Expedition without good Pi|&s;tols, that in ca&s;e of Accident, he might be in a po&s;ture of defending his Life. Thus &s;eeing him&s;elf pre&s;s'd, he drew out one of them from un|der his Petticoats, which &s;topp'd <HI>Florange</HI>'s Rage: for naturally he had a great re&s;pect for all &s;orts of Fire Arms, running, at lea&s;t, as fa&s;t in his Retreat, as he had done when he came to acco&s;t <HI>Mainville.</HI> When he was in the Village I lately menti|on'd, he began then to breathe, and &s;ounding an Horn, he call'd all his Hunters, that could not be far di|&s;tant. They forthwith rang'd them|&s;elves about him, and <HI>Florange</HI> ha|ving
<PB N="115" REF="64"> related his Adventure to them, exhorted them to run after the Un|known, &s;aying, that he mu&s;t needs be a High-way-man.</P>
<P><HI>Mainville</HI> hearing the Call, did very much &s;u&s;pect that he was going to be pur&s;u'd; thus being very willing to e&s;cape further trouble, if he could, he &s;purr'd on. But his Mule not go|ing &s;o fa&s;t as Hor&s;es, the Hunt&s;men overtook him before he could get to a Wood he thought to have be|taken him&s;elf to. They call'd out immediately to him, to yeild him|&s;elf up; but chu&s;ing rather to dye, than expo&s;e him&s;elf to the Di&s;creti|on of his Enemy, he took his Two Pi&s;tols in his Hands, and cry'd out to the fir&s;t that advanc'd, that it &s;hould co&s;t him his Life, if he pre|tended to do any Violence to him.</P>
<P>In this nick of time there hap|pen'd Officers to come by, that were returning from the Army; and they &s;eeing &s;o many Men attacque a &s;im|ple
<PB N="116" REF="65"> Woman, they &s;ided with her, a&s;&s;u|ring her, that no hurt &s;hould be don her, unle&s;s they were all fir&s;t kill'd. After they had thus offer'd their Ser|vices to <HI>Mainville,</HI> they ask'd <HI>Flo|range,</HI> and all his Company, what that Lady had done to them, that they us'd her with &s;o little Civility; And as <HI>Florange</HI> had only &s;poke to them of his Su&s;picions, they car|ry'd away <HI>Mainville</HI> in &s;pight of <HI>Florange,</HI> and promis'd to guard him whither he pleas'd. When he was gone a League from thence, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &s;aid he to them, <HI>you have taken a great deal of pains, and I hope one day to return the Civility: for though you know not who I am, yet do I know you. In the mean while; if you are minded that the Ob|ligation I have to you, &s;hould be com|pleat, you will &s;uffer me now to go, without having the Curio&s;ity of know|ing who the Per&s;on is who&s;e Defence you have undertaken.</HI> At the&s;e words they all made him an&s;wer, out of a
<PB N="117" REF="65"> per&s;wa&s;ion that he was a Woman, that they would not for&s;ake her till they had brought her to her own Home; and <HI>Mainville</HI> &s;eeing their Ob&s;tinacy, unmask'd him&s;elf, &s;ur|prizing them very much in making him&s;elf known.</P>
<P>The Command he had in the Army, afforded him a great Autho|rity. Be&s;ides, he was of &s;o con&s;i|derable a Family, that many people were bound to have a re&s;pect for him. Thus the&s;e Officers ask'd his Pardon for having oblig'd him to make him&s;elf known again&s;t his will, as &s;u&s;pecting that he had put him&s;elf into a Di&s;gui&s;e upon &s;ome occa&s;ion that he was not willing &s;hould be known publickly. <HI>Main|ville</HI> being a well-bred Gentleman, told them, that after the Service they had done him, it was ea&s;ie for him to excu&s;e their Curio&s;ity. How|ever that he begg'd of them, not to make the lea&s;t mention of his Ad|venture, becau&s;e that there were
<PB N="118" REF="66"> people who delighted in making the wor&s;t of all things. He embrac'd them all after this; and thus having got him&s;elf off from this bad Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he went to find out his Ser|vants, who were not far di&s;tant.</P>
<P><HI>Florange,</HI> who was in De&s;pon|dency, for that the&s;e Officers had made him mi&s;s of his aim, making reflection of what had newly befal|len him, fancy'd there mu&s;t be &s;ome My&s;tery underneath All, and re|turn'd to his own Hou&s;e with his Soul full of Su&s;picion. At his arri|val he ask'd his Wife's Woman, whom &s;he had lent her Cloaths to; and this Que&s;tion having puzzled her, &s;he blu&s;h'd, in&s;omuch that <HI>Florange</HI> having ob&s;erv'd &s;ome Change in her Countenance, he pre&s;s'd her &s;till more to tell him what &s;he had done with them. She then &s;tutter'd, &s;aying one while, &s;he had lent no body any Cloaths, ano|ther, that &s;he had quite forgot to whom it was. <HI>Florange</HI> judging
<PB N="119" REF="66"> by her Confu&s;ion, that &s;omething had pa&s;s'd which it was not thought fitting he &s;hould know of, went di|rectly to his Wife's Chamber; to whom he put an Hundred Que&s;ti|ons, that &s;o he might get from her &s;ome light into this matter. The Marchione&s;s had newly been told what was befallen <HI>Mainville</HI> and her Hu&s;band, and how the former had got out of the other's Hands. Thus having nothing to fear on that &s;ide, &s;he made him an&s;wer, that he made a great deal of noi&s;e for a Garment, or &s;o; and that &s;he did not enquire &s;o much as he, with what her Wo|man did with her things. During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the Miller of the Hou&s;e arriv'd, and finding all the Doors open, he mounted into the very Chamber where <HI>Florange</HI> was. <HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;aid he to him, without fir&s;t enquiring, whether he was in an Humour to hear him, <HI>I come to a&s;&s;ure you, that it was none of my Lads that was &s;awcy to my Ladies
<PB N="120" REF="67"> Woman: they are all at the Mill; and I neither challenge him nor his Mule, which you may make what Ex|ample you plea&s;e of. It is &s;ome Rogue or other, that &s;ays he belongs to me, that &s;o he may do me an injury; but good my Lord, let me be&s;eech your Wor&s;hip, to protect me in this occa&s;i|on, &s;ince you have the Knave in your hands, and that you can by the force of torments, draw the Confe&s;&s;ion of his Crimes from him.</HI></P>
<P>What this man &s;aid, was <HI>Hebrew</HI> to <HI>Florange,</HI> who knew not what pa&s;s'd; but being told the Adven|ture of the Miller's Man, he gave order for the fetching him out of Pri&s;on, and that he &s;hould be brought to him that very moment. Tho&s;e that were officious to obey him, ran immediately to the Tower where he had been &s;hut up; but they found the Door of it open, and the Bird flown. Thus they re|turn'd much amaz'd, to tell <HI>Flo|range,</HI> that &s;ome body had let the
<PB N="121" REF="67"> Pri&s;oner e&s;cape, and that they knew not who it was. At the&s;e words his Su&s;picions re-doubled, &s;o much the more as that he then remembred that the Dam&s;el he perceiv'd had a Mule, and that there was great probability of her being the Miller's Man.</P>
<P>He &s;ent the Miller away very much &s;atisfy'd, by telling him, that he meant him no harm; but &s;eek|ing to dive into this my&s;tery, he ask'd his Wife, what was become of the Pri&s;oner, and by who&s;e order he had been put out of Pri&s;on. <HI>He must needs,</HI> the Marchione&s;s reply'd, <HI>have found the Secret of making his E&s;cape him&s;elf, and I know no body here that would have been &s;o bold as to have done it without your Orders. The People that have been concern'd in't, Madam, Florange</HI> reparty'd, <HI>are more &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive to your Lady&s;hips order than to mine; and however you defend your &s;elf, yet do I &s;mell out your Contri|vance.</HI></P>
<PB N="122" REF="68">
<P>This Conver&s;ation was upon the point of being keen on both &s;ides, when the &s;ame Relation that had reconcil'd them, came in. <HI>You come very &s;ea&s;onably,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Florange</HI> to him, <HI>to do me Ju&s;tice. You accus'd me of being whym&s;ical and jealous; but I do not think you would harbour that Opinion, after what I have to tell you.</HI> He thereupon acquainted him with what had newly happen'd, and did firmly believe, that he was go|ing to take his part, when the other call'd him Vi&s;ionary more than e|ver. <HI>You rave Cou&s;in,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>and I am very &s;orry I mu&s;t tell you, that you &s;erve for a Laughing|&s;tock to all our Countrey. I &s;hould make a Mock of you as well as the re&s;t, were I not your Kin&s;man; but I mu&s;t at length come to that, as no longer finding any means of excu&s;ing you in the World. I am not &s;o mad, Cou&s;in,</HI> reply'd <HI>Florange</HI> to him, <HI>as you would fain make me believe: and if the like thing befel you, you would
<PB N="123" REF="68"> oblige me, in acquainting me what you your &s;elf would &s;ay of it. I &s;hould &s;ay,</HI> his Kin&s;man reparty'd, <HI>that a real, or a fal&s;e Miller was come to my hou&s;e, and that &s;eeing him&s;elf con|fin'd, he had forc'd his Pri&s;on. As to the Habit, which you make the principal Cau&s;e of your Di&s;quiets, I would &s;till &s;ay, that my Wife's Wo|man had lent it to &s;ome friend; that I had met with this friend on the way; that &s;he would not make her &s;elf known, and without tormenting my head, to dive into the rea&s;on, I would let all people be at quiet at home, which would let me be &s;o. That is to &s;ay,</HI> reply'd <HI>Florange, that you would be a very convenient contented Hus|band. So convenient,</HI> the Cou&s;in an&s;wer'd, <HI>that I would never think ill of my Wife, unle&s;s I &s;aw it with my own Eyes. Be&s;ides, to what purpo&s;e,</HI> continued he, <HI>d' ye &s;o much &s;hrift into a thing which can only afford us matter of trouble? And &s;hould I not rather chu&s;e to live as all well-bred
<PB N="124" REF="69"> People do, than live as you do.</HI> The&s;e Words vex'd <HI>Florange,</HI> in&s;omuch, that he was going to &s;ay &s;ome di&s;ob|liging things to his Relation, when that this latter, to avoid his ill Hu|mour, went his ways, without ta|king leave of him.</P>
<P>Some days after a Letter came from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Florange,</HI> by which he had notice, that his Law-Suit was ready to come to a Trial, and that his Pre&s;ence there was requi|&s;ite. I intimated a while agoe, that he had laid a&s;ide the Care of this Law-Suit, to hinder <HI>Mainville</HI> from &s;eeing his Wife. His Jealou&s;ie ha|ving then rather augmented than di|mini&s;h'd, he re&s;olv'd to take her a|long with him, that he might be the better &s;ecured of her Conduct. Af|ter that he was got to Town, a per|&s;on that pretended to be a Friend of his, but meant to banter him, as knowing his Weakne&s;s, told him, that if he was &s;o much concern'd to know whether his Wife was hone&s;t,
<PB N="125" REF="69"> he would furni&s;h him with a good contrivance. That he knew a famous Female Fortune-teller, to whom nothing was unknown, and that if he would con&s;ult her, &s;he would ac|quaint him with &s;uch things as would &s;urprize him. <HI>Florange</HI> did not want Wit, &s;o as that knowing out of what motive this man di&s;|cours'd him in this manner, he thank'd him coldly for his offers; adding, that it did not belong to all People to concern them&s;elves in the Affairs of a Husband and Wife. Ne|verthele&s;s <HI>Florange</HI> con&s;ider'd in him&s;elf of what he had &s;aid to him, and being &s;illy enough as to ima|gine, that a Fortune teller could convict his Wife of the Intrigue &s;he had with <HI>Mainville,</HI> he enquir'd, under hand, where tho&s;e &s;ort of People dwelt, and was not long without being inform'd of the Lodgings of a Woman that pre|tended that way. None but Fools went to her Hou&s;e, or Per&s;ons ex|treamly
<PB N="126" REF="70"> credulous. Yet not one came thence without being unde|ceiv'd: for it was by Chance, if &s;he &s;poke one Truth among a thou&s;and Lyes. <HI>Florange</HI> repaired thither one Morning without any Retinue, and de&s;ired this Woman to conceal no|thing from him, of whatever con|&s;equence the things were that &s;he &s;hould find out, either by his Hand or Phy&s;iogmony. The Fortune|teller, by his words, gue&s;&s;ing at his Ingenuity, began with making him pay before-hand; then di&s;cours'd him with what &s;he was wont to &s;ay to all tho&s;e that were &s;o &s;illy as to come and con&s;ult her. <HI>Florange</HI> knowing then how much he was in the wrong, to hope for any thing in her, told her, that it was Pains and Money thrown away, as to come and &s;ee her; and as &s;he endeavour'd to &s;ave her &s;elf by a World of &s;illy Stories, with which &s;he lur'd the mo&s;t credulous, there came a Man into the Room, habited after a caprici|ous
<PB N="127" REF="70"> manner, and that would have Bug-bear'd little Children. His Ha|bit was Black, all done with &s;treams of Fire; in&s;omuch that one would have &s;aid, that he had been a Devil that was return'd from Hell, or at lea&s;t, a Man that had borrow'd the form of one. He had a Mask that repre&s;ented a Face to the Life; but &s;o di&s;mal, that a body trembled to look upon it. This Mask was not made of Pa&s;t-board, as all others are, and you would have taken it for real Fle&s;h. The re&s;t of his Ha|billement &s;uited exactly with the Mask. He had Buskins on, and in|&s;tead of a Lyon's Skin, a <HI>Grote&s;que,</HI> repre&s;enting the Furies, and to his very Shooes one would have &s;aid, that they had been the Scales of a Serpent, &s;o well had Art imitated Nature. This Counterfeit-Mon&s;ter held a Wand in his Hand, with which he &s;truck thrice upon <HI>Florange</HI>'s Head. This poor Marquis needed not this Over-plus of terror, having
<PB N="128" REF="71"> been &s;ufficiently frighted at the &s;ight of the Mon&s;ter. He was more dead than alive; in&s;omuch that he would willingly have given the half of his E&s;tate to have been from thence. But his Fright was quite an other thing, when the fal&s;e De|vil &s;poke to him in this manner; <HI>Since that thou believ'&s;t that the For|tune-teller is not capable of telling thee thy Life, I am come my &s;elf to inform thee of all thou would'&s;t know: Thy Wife is more di&s;creet than thou de&s;erve&s;t; and though there be &s;ome Appearances again&s;t her, the&s;e Ap|pearances are le&s;s &s;trong than truth.</HI> Mainville <HI>is neither in love with her, nor &s;he with him, and thou mu&s;t only accu&s;e thy own Jealou&s;ie, if any one has been &s;o &s;pightful as to take a de|light in allaruming thee. The Let|ters thou ha&s;t receiv'd are forged Let|ters, and if thou continue&s;t to be jea|lous, a great many more will be paulm'd upon thee. Such as thou &s;ee&s;t me, my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to make the living
<PB N="129" REF="71"> mad, and I &s;hall neither &s;pare my Contrivances nor my Pains, to di&s;turb thy Quiet, unle&s;s thou avail'&s;t thy &s;elf of my advice.</HI></P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay which of the two, <HI>Florange,</HI> or the Fortune-teller, re|main'd the mo&s;t amaz'd at the&s;e words: for &s;he could not apprehend who it was that plaid this part. True indeed, that &s;he was not unacquaint|ed with the fal&s;e Devils Habillement, having her &s;elf caus'd it to be made, to fright &s;uch as were fearful. But &s;he knew not who could take it &s;o in the nick, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ay &s;uch particular things to <HI>Florange.</HI> However to render the Adventure &s;till the more extraordinary, <HI>Mainville,</HI> and the Marchione&s;s, being egg'd on by the like Curio&s;ity, came to the &s;ame place, and finding the Hou&s;e-door open they mounted into the very Fortune tellers Chamber, without meeting with any body to ask them their Bu&s;ine&s;s. The fal&s;e Devil had not &s;hut the Door, &s;o as that <HI>Main|ville</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="72"> and the Marchione&s;s entred therein, not in the lea&s;t expecting the People they there met withal. <HI>Florange</HI>'s Fright was extream at the &s;ight of them, imagining, that the Devil had made them come without their con&s;ent. But that of <HI>Main|ville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s was no le&s;s, &s;eeing <HI>Florange;</HI> for then they thought them&s;elves lo&s;t without Re|medy. He that acted the Magician, or the Devil, as you &s;hall plea&s;e to call him, &s;eem'd quite unhing'd and nonplus'd, remaining for &s;ome time without &s;peaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> word. But all on the &s;udden rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">vering his &s;peech: <HI>Admire my Power<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> &s;aid he to <HI>Flo|range: Here are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> two Per&s;ons that occa&s;ion thy Di&s;quiet, whom I have caus'd to come hither on purpo&s;e to tell thee what familiarity pa&s;&s;es between them two: Thou wilt learn their in|nocency from their own Mouths, if thou do&s;t not put confidence enough in what I have told thee. Florange</HI> fell into a Swoon at the&s;e words; and
<PB N="131" REF="72"> the fal&s;e Devil &s;eeing him in that Condition, repuls'd <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s with his Wand, telling them they had nothing more to do there. They did not &s;tay to be told it twice; and the Marchione&s;s ha|ving with much a-do got again to her Coach, in &s;he &s;tept, with a Hor|ror more ea&s;ie to imagine than de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P><HI>Florange</HI> continu'd &s;till &s;ome time in his Swoon, while that the fal&s;e Devil took the Fortune teller into an other Room, to tell her, that ha|ving had the folly; as well as others, to come and &s;ee her, he had found that Chamber-door open, wherein he entred. That meeting with no body there, and hearing loud talk|ing in the next Room, he had li|&s;ten'd, and perceiv'd <HI>Florange</HI>'s Voice. And having perceiv'd at the &s;ame time upon the Bed, that Ha|bit he had upon his Body, he had put it on, to tell him his Fortune, as being inform'd to every little cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="132" REF="73"> of his Life. That &s;he had &s;een the &s;ucce&s;s of it, and that it was her part now to maintain the Fame &s;uch an Adventure was going to gain her in the World.</P>
<P>The Fortune-teller was very glad that Chance had &s;o well &s;econded her Cheats: and all haughty upon this Event, &s;he gave <HI>Florange</HI> a Check when he came to his Sen&s;es a|gain, for that he would not give Credit to the Wonders of her Art. <HI>Florange</HI> would doubtle&s;s have ask'd her Pardon, if he had had the pow|er but to &s;peak but one bare word; but he was &s;till &s;o much afraid, that all that he could do, was to get to a Hackney-Coach that waited for him at the Door. When he was got in he began to breathe, as thinking that the Devil had not &s;o much power o|ver him there. He then promis'd never to &s;ee, as long as he liv'd, any Fortune-teller: and being got home, he us'd his Wife quite otherwi&s;e than he had done of a long while, as ap|prehending,
<PB N="133" REF="73"> that if he &s;hould u&s;e her ill, the Devil would ri&s;e up in her defence, as he had threatned to do.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Florange</HI> &s;taid &s;till &s;ome time at <HI>Paris,</HI> and having met with <HI>Mainville</HI> in a Company, he &s;poke to him as if he had never born him any grudg. Nay, he ask'd him what was the Cau&s;e they did not &s;ee one another now; in&s;omuch, that <HI>Mainville</HI> would have been in a &s;trange <HI>Maze,</HI> had he been ignorant of the Fortune-teller's Adventure. But knowing what pa&s;s'd at her Hou&s;e, and how much <HI>Florange</HI> was of a fearful Humour, he knew to what to attribute his Change.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s were not able to comprehend whom they had the Obligation to of what was fallen out; for no body had ever known any thing of their Concerns, &s;ave <HI>Grand-Champ</HI> and the Dam&s;el I have
<PB N="134" REF="74"> mention'd: and they knew very well, that neither of them two had revealed their Secret. For the Mar|chione&s;s had left her Woman at home; and as for <HI>Grand-Champ,</HI> they could not &s;u&s;pect him, as knowing him long &s;ince dead. But whoever it was, they were endebt|ed to, they look'd upon it as a great piece of Service: for they began a|gain to &s;ee one another, and that too without <HI>Florange</HI>'s finding fault. <HI>Mainville</HI> was not however wanting to have &s;ome Pre-caution, when he was with the Marchione&s;s, as know|ing there is nothing &s;o ea&s;ie to kindle anew as the Su&s;picions of a jealous Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus they liv'd in &s;ome &s;ort of re|po&s;e for a time: But as Prudence is very rare in &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, the&s;e Lovers forgot that <HI>Florange</HI> was na|turally prone to Jealou&s;ie, and that the lea&s;t thing was capable of giving him Umbrage. They were ever by one another, not being able to re|main
<PB N="135" REF="74"> a moment without enterchang|ing of Words: and when Chance &s;eparated them, one might in their Faces read a certain Grief, as made tho&s;e judge that had the lea&s;t Con|cern in it, that they were not in ill Terms with one another. <HI>Florange</HI> began al&s;o to doubt that the fal&s;e Devil had told him a Lye, when he a&s;&s;ured him, that his Wife was ho|ne&s;t. <HI>The Devils,</HI> &s;aid he in him|&s;elf, <HI>are Lyars, and a Man mu&s;t be as &s;imple as I to put trust to their Words. Be&s;ides there is &s;omething in this mat|ter that I do not apprehend: for their bu&s;ine&s;s being to mole&s;t Mankind, how comes this, if he be a real Devil, to endeavour to cure me of my &s;u&s;pici|ons? Thou art abus'd,</HI> Florange, ad|ded he, <HI>and like a fool, fallest into the Trap. Are not thy Eyes &s;urer than all that can be &s;aid to thee? And what ha&s;t thou to do with the te&s;timony of an Other, when thou thy &s;elf do&s;t but too clearly &s;ee thy di&s;honour?</HI></P>
<PB N="136" REF="75">
<P>Thus confirming him&s;elf daily more and more in the Opinion, that he had been impos'd on, he took &s;omewhat extraordinary mea&s;ures to &s;hrift into <HI>Mainville</HI>'s and his Wife's Intrigue. He pretended not to take any notice of their fondne&s;&s;es, but re&s;olv'd to &s;urprize them, when they lea&s;t expected it, and to put them &s;o many Que&s;tions in one ano|ther's Pre&s;ence, that they &s;hould be nonplus'd. He knew that the mo|tions of the Countenance common|ly di&s;cover what lies mo&s;t hid in the Heart: and when one does not find one's Con&s;cience clear, it is an hard matter to keep one's Judgment. Whereupon he one day ask'd them, when they were in a deep Chat, whe|ther there was not a great deal of Plea&s;ure, in entertaining one's &s;elf thus a&s;ide with what one loves, ad|ding that they mu&s;t needs ta&s;t this happine&s;s often, &s;ince it was but a few days ago that they had thus been together alone. It is ea&s;ie to imagine
<PB N="137" REF="75"> the Confu&s;ion the&s;e Lovers were under at this Di&s;cour&s;e; they were in &s;uch a Maze they could not give him one bare word of an&s;wer. But <HI>Florange</HI> judging by the &s;tate they were in, that his Su&s;picions were but too well grounded. <HI>To what pur|po&s;e,</HI> renew'd he, <HI>is it for you to u&s;e finene&s;s with me? and am not I &s;o clear-&s;ighted, as to know what I ought to believe of it? You love tenderly one another, and I &s;hould have but little regard for both, &s;hould I oppo&s;e &s;o fine an Amity.</HI> The coolne&s;s he affect|ed in uttering the&s;e Words, did &s;o to all intents di&s;order <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s, that they did no|thing but gaze upon one another, as if they had complemented one ano|ther, who &s;hould an&s;wer him fir&s;t. At la&s;t, <HI>Mainville</HI> being confus'd to the highe&s;t degree, endeavour'd to undeceive <HI>Florange,</HI> endeavouring to per&s;wade him, that being &s;o much his Friend, as he was, he could not, without an extream ingratitude, ca&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="76"> his Eyes upon his Wife. <HI>Let's leave our friend&s;hip there,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Flo|range</HI> coldly, <HI>and I &s;hould be very much too blame, were I contented with your Rea&s;ons, &s;ince, All dear as I am to you, as you &s;ay, my Wife mu&s;t needs he dearer to you than I am. She has Charms for Men which I have not, and made as &s;he is, &s;he would have rea&s;on eo complain, if under the Pretext of our Acquaintance, you re|fus'd to love her. And indeed, you cannot put it out of my head, but that you do her Ju&s;tice. Mainville</HI> being no longer able to endure a Conver|&s;ation that madded him, us'd then his utmo&s;t efforts to in&s;inuate into him, that he had never had any thoughts of the Marchione&s;s: But <HI>Florange</HI> turning towards her, <HI>And Madam,</HI> &s;aid he to her, <HI>will you be as in&s;incere as he, and will you main|tain it to my face, that you have been able to be &s;o long expos'd to the Cajol|laries of a well-bred man, without &s;uffering your &s;elf to be affected.</HI> The
<PB N="139" REF="76"> Marchione&s;s made him an&s;wer, that he did her the highe&s;t injury, to put &s;uch a Que&s;tion to her: That her Duty did &s;ufficiently inform her, that &s;he ought to love him only, and that he ought not to doubt but that &s;he did all that her Duty directed her. <HI>A meer Re&s;very, Madam,</HI> he reply'd to her, <HI>is that &s;ame Duty with which your Lady&s;hip pretends to entertain me; and a thou&s;and Wo|men, that are no le&s;s honest than your Lady&s;hip, tread it daily under foot; But &s;ince you a&s;&s;ure me, that it is &s;trong enough, as to hinder you from paying to my Lord of</HI> Mainville<HI>'s me|rit what you owe it, and that on the other &s;ide he vows, that the friend&s;hip he has for me, hinders him from pay|ing you what he owes you, you will both do well never to &s;ee one another more. And indeed, it would be lay|ing your Reputation too much at stake, Madam,</HI> added he, <HI>any long|er to &s;uffer the Vi&s;its of a Man that has not the &s;ence to know your worth.
<PB N="140" REF="77"> And you, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, addre&s;|&s;ing his Speech to <HI>Mainville, you would do me a kindne&s;s, never to &s;et foot more in my hou&s;e: for I e&s;teem my Wife, and do not love people that &s;light her &s;o much, or are &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, that thus they can re&s;i&s;t &s;o many Charms.</HI> At the &s;ame time he &s;crap'd <HI>Mainville</HI> a long Leg, as much as to &s;ay, that it was time for him to be gone, and &s;hewing him the Door, he made him apprehend thereby, that he was not of a Humour &s;o ea&s;ily to be paulm'd upon in his Beleif.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in no wi&s;e go about to re|pre&s;ent to you in this place, neither <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Amazement, nor the Marchione&s;&s;e's Confu&s;ion. They could hardly imagine what they heard; but however loth they were to obey <HI>Florange</HI>'s Command, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit; nay, and without re|ply. When <HI>Mainville</HI> was gone, the Marchione&s;s &s;tomacking what had newly happen'd, and being unable to bear with a &s;eparation from her
<PB N="141" REF="77"> Lover, &s;he began to di&s;charge her Anger upon her Husband. She told him, that his Capriciou&s;ne&s;s was beyond Example, and that &s;he needed only to blaze about his Car|riage, to put him out of repute with all the World. <HI>Florange</HI> could have an&s;wer'd her, that as he had been out of repute a long while, he had nothing more to manage upon that Point, but continuing in the &s;ame manner he began, he made her an|&s;wer, with a mighty &s;erious look, that he perceiv'd the ingratitude of Women; that he had newly done her a great piece of Service, in rid|ding her of a Man that was good for nothing; and that neverthele&s;s, in&s;tead of thanking him for it, &s;he loaded him with Reproaches.</P>
<P>After this, the Lady could not expect to &s;ee <HI>Mainville</HI> again at her own Hou&s;e; in&s;omuch, that when they were minded to &s;peak with one another, they were oblig'd to bor|row the Hou&s;e of &s;ome &s;he friend.
<PB N="142" REF="78"> The&s;e Pre-cautions render'd their Interviews much &s;eldomer, and by Con&s;equence much more agreeable, becau&s;e that Difficulty is wont to be a &s;ea&s;oning to Plea&s;ures, though that all People are not pleas'd with &s;uch a Ragoo. It was then a little after <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> a time that Merri|ments and Fea&s;tings begin at <HI>Paris,</HI> when a Friend of <HI>Florange</HI>'s having been pre&s;ented with a No&s;egay at a Ball, made him agree, that he &s;hould entertain his Lady with the Fiddles. The Lady being inform'd of it, &s;ent notice to <HI>Mainville,</HI> that he &s;hould not let that Occa&s;ion &s;lip, without making advantage on't; in&s;omuch, that he di&s;guis'd him&s;elf, that he might not be known in the A&s;&s;em|bly. It was numerous and fine; and as the Marchione&s;s was weary of dancing, &s;he plac'd her &s;elf in a Cor|ner, whither <HI>Mainville</HI> repair'd im|mediately to entertain her. He would have &s;taid at her Feet till the Ball had been ended, if a Lady had
<PB N="143" REF="78"> not come to take him out to dance with her. He could not but out of Civility give her his Hand: But while he danc'd, another Ma&s;que|rader took his Place, and began to &s;ay &s;uch particular things to Madam <HI>de Florange,</HI> that &s;he was mightily &s;urpriz'd at it. His Garb was that of a <HI>Gyp&s;ey,</HI> which had help'd him much to the acco&s;ting of her. <HI>Ma|dam,</HI> &s;aid he to her, <HI>Ladies are com|monly curious, and the Habit I wear, informs you, that telling of Fortunes is my Province. If you doubt it, you need only to give me your Hand, and you will pre&s;ently perceive that I am no Bungler in my Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> There|upon he gave her an Account of <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Amour, from the begin|ning to the very end, and when it came to the place of the Fortune|teller: <HI>It is to me, Madam,</HI> added he, <HI>that you have the obligation of being freed from that ill &s;tep. I had &s;ome Relation to that Woman, which oblig'd me to go often to her hou&s;e, and
<PB N="144" REF="79"> I came thither pretty &s;ea&s;onably to do you Service.</HI> After he had given her this Account, he left her, without being to be per&s;waded to make him|&s;elf known, though &s;he pre&s;s'd him very much. But as he was going his ways, <HI>Florange,</HI> who had ob|&s;erv'd his Conver&s;ation with his Wife, and who took him for <HI>Main|ville,</HI> by rea&s;on he had &s;omething of his Air, and of his Shape, &s;topp'd him by the Arm, ju&s;t when he was at the bottom of the Stair-ca&s;e, and told him, that he had &s;omething to &s;ay to him. The Ma&s;que &s;taid at the&s;e Words, and <HI>Florange</HI> &s;eeing that he was ju&s;t ready to hear him. <HI>I thought,</HI> &s;aid he to him, <HI>that after having admoni&s;h'd thee, never to &s;ee my Wife more, thou would'&s;t never have had the audaciou&s;ne&s;s to di&s;cour&s;e her, and particularly in my &s;ight. But by what I perceive, thou mak'st no ac|count of what is &s;aid to thee, &s;ince to the prejudice of my Prohibition, thou ha&s;t been newly talking to her. Now
<PB N="145" REF="79"> for once and all, either let this not happen again, or I &s;hall u&s;e &s;uch means as &s;hall make you repent you did not take my Advice.</HI></P>
<P>The Ma&s;que, that did not expect &s;uch a Complement, was very much &s;urpriz'd at it; but having Rea&s;ons not to an&s;wer &s;o keenly as he was talk'd to: <HI>I know not,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>what you mean by this Di&s;cour&s;e, and you certainly take me for an other, ha|ving never &s;poke with your Lady before to day. Wherefore you could not give me In&s;tances of your jealou&s;ie, as you tell me. But &s;ince I now know that makes you unea&s;ie, I a&s;&s;ure you, that for fear of di&s;turbing your repo&s;e, I &s;hall care|fully avoid meeting her, being very wil|ling thereby to let you &s;ee, that I &s;hall ever Court the Occa&s;ions of obliging you.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing could be more hand|&s;ome than this An&s;wer. But <HI>Flo|range</HI> being of a Character to be fu|rious, when one crept before him, it augmented his Audaciou&s;ne&s;s; in|&s;omuch,
<PB N="146" REF="80"> that &s;peaking a Language &s;till more arrogant than the former, he told the Ma&s;que, <HI>That Excu&s;es were but &s;light Reparations, when the Offences were real. That thus he meant to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his impru|dence, as he de&s;erved.</HI> And at the &s;ame time laying his Hand to his Sword, he oblig'd the Ma&s;que, in his own Defence, to take one his Foot-man carry'd for him. Per|chance <HI>Florange</HI> would then have been glad he had not begun the Quarrel; but &s;eeing that the Ma&s;que did but parry, without making any Thru&s;t at him, it encourag'd him &s;o as to ru&s;h on upon him, and pu&s;hing blindly on, he ran him&s;elf upon the other's Sword. However, the Ma&s;que receiv'd at the &s;ame time a Thru&s;t quite through the Body, which made him fall &s;tone dead on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e they had made in quar|relling, had made the People run to part them; and <HI>Florange</HI>'s Friends
<PB N="147" REF="80"> &s;eeing him all cover'd with Blood, and the Ma&s;que lying in the Du&s;t, ask'd him the Occa&s;ion of their Quarrel. <HI>It is my Wife,</HI> an&s;wer'd he them, <HI>who is the Occa&s;ion of my Death. Hold me up, I conjure you; for I have but one moment more to live. But if any of you would oblige me, let him go tell her, that in &s;hed|ding my own Blood, I have at lea&s;t the Comfort of having taken</HI> Mainville<HI>'s Life away.</HI> At the&s;e Words the Ru|mour ran immediately through the whole A&s;&s;embly, that <HI>Mainville</HI> was newly kill'd; and this News extra|ordinarily afflicted the Marchione&s;s. She gave deep Sighs, and without minding in that moment either her Husband's Wound, or all that Peo|ple could &s;ay of her Conduct, &s;he ran where the Dead Man lay, to &s;ee if her misfortune was without Re|medy. As &s;oon as &s;he had ca&s;t her Eyes upon his Cloaths, &s;he pre&s;ent|ly perceiv'd they had given her a &s;al&s;e Allarum; and &s;tudying to re|pair

But this needed no great trouble; for as &s;oon as the Decea&s;ed's Mask was taken off, all the Servants of the Hou&s;e knew it to be <HI>Grand Champ;</HI> and &s;he her &s;elf going near the Bo|dy, quickly perceiv'd that they were in the right. For &s;ome time &s;he could hardly believe what &s;he &s;aw, as being pre-po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with his Death, upon the Account that had been gi|ven her her &s;elf in the Village before mention'd: But you mu&s;t know, that &s;he had been mi&s;inform'd, be|cau&s;e at the time they imagin'd he had breath'd his la&s;t, he was only fallen into a <HI>Lethargy,</HI> occa&s;ion'd by the lo&s;s of Blood, and which
<PB N="149" REF="81"> he recover'd from &s;ome Hours af|ter.</P>
<P>As the Marchione&s;s had been well pleas'd to hear of <HI>Grand-Champ</HI>'s Death, in&s;tead of that of <HI>Mainville,</HI> it put her Hu&s;band into an incredi|ble De&s;pondency. For be&s;ides the Grief he had to know his Wife's Lover &s;till in a Condition of di|&s;turbing his Re&s;t, he was out of Countenance for having wrongfully &s;hewn his Jealou&s;ie in &s;uch good Company: and what is more, he was not without Regret for having kill'd the unfortunate <HI>Grand-Champ.</HI> But what di&s;quieted him more than all this, is, that the Chyrurgeons dur&s;t not a&s;certain he would e&s;cape from his Wound, as finding it very dangerous. While he lay a curing his Friends us'd their Intere&s;t to ob|tain his Pardon; and <HI>Grand Champ,</HI> having no body to revenge his Me|mory, they ea&s;ily effected their Bu|&s;ine&s;s. After this <HI>Florange</HI> recover'd by little and little, and &s;eeing him|&s;elf
<PB N="150" REF="82"> in perfect Health, he us'd his ut|mo&s;t endeavour to bring his Cau&s;e to a Trial, that &s;o he might return into the Countrey, where he fancy'd he &s;hould live more at quiet than at <HI>Pa|ris.</HI></P>
<P>When he was in hopes of having it brought to Trial, the Defendants, who had not over good Right, and who found an Advantage of defer|ring the Verdict, bethought them|&s;elves of pre&s;enting a Reque&s;t to the Council, by which they required to have the Cau&s;e left to an other Parliament than that of <HI>Paris,</HI> al|ledging, that <HI>Florange</HI> and his Wife had therein a World of Relations upon the Bench. The Affair being examined in full Council, <HI>Florange</HI>'s Parties obtain'd what they demand|ed, and were referred to <HI>Rouen.</HI></P>
<P>This Decree was extream cruel to <HI>Mainville</HI> and the Marchione&s;s, who notwith&s;tanding <HI>Florange</HI>'s Pro|hibitions and Pre-cautions, did ne|verthele&s;s continue to &s;ee one ano|ther.
<PB N="151" REF="82"> They knew <HI>Paris</HI> to be the only place where Intrigues could be conceal'd, and that in the other Towns, however great they might be, one remains expos'd to the Cen|&s;ure of all People; a Man of Quality e&s;pecially not being able to take a &s;tep without furni&s;hing matter for talk. Neverthele&s;s having in their Interviews found Plea&s;ures they could neither of them renounce, without doing a great Violence up|on them&s;elves, they contriv'd be|fore they parted, how to &s;ee one another at <HI>Rouen;</HI> and no &s;ooner was <HI>Florange</HI> there, but <HI>Mainville</HI> came thither <HI>incognito.</HI></P>
<P>A little before, he had, with his Credit, &s;erv'd a Pre&s;ident of that Parliament, who had had a great Concern at Court; in&s;omuch, that not doubting of his Acknowledg|ment, he went and alighted at his Hou&s;e. There, without &s;cruple, he declared to him what brought him to <HI>Rouen,</HI> and that he had oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="152" REF="83"> for his Service. A thou&s;and Per&s;ons in this Pre&s;ident's Circum|&s;tances, would have put on their Gravity, and have likewi&s;e told him without &s;cruple, that he might &s;eek out an other Confident; but this Pre&s;ident being very willing to make Returns for the Obligation he had to him, and be&s;ides, being no Enemy to Nature, he made him an&s;wer, that he might di&s;po&s;e of him, of his Hou&s;e, and of all he had in his power. <HI>I'le not have &s;o much,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Mainville</HI> to him; <HI>and all I require of you, is to lend me one of your Coaches, when I go abroad with a Parliament-Robes. For when I go to my Mictre&s;&s;es Hou&s;e, I mean to be taken for you; and all that we are to have a care of, is, that it be not known that I am here. Thus you mu&s;t make me pa&s;s in your own Hou&s;e, for one of your own Relations; and if People wonder that I make no Vi&s;its in the Town, you may &s;ay, that I am &s;ick. If this was the only thing to be reme|dy'd,</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="83"> an&s;wer'd the Pre&s;ident, <HI>the thing would be very ea&s;ie. I know al|ready, without your needing to &s;peak to me of it, that you have People here in whom you confide; and I may &s;ay the &s;ame thing of mine, whom I need only to forbid &s;peaking, that you were at my Hou&s;e, to bind them to &s;ilence. But the Difficulty that I find herein is, that you would, methinks, pay a Vi&s;it to the Marchione&s;s under my Name, and that when you are at her Hou&s;e, it &s;hould be thought to be me. Right,</HI> Mainville reparty'd, <HI>And this is ju&s;t what I de&s;ire: And if I can de|ceive the Publick, I will take my time &s;o well, as never to go to her Lodgings but when her Husband is abroad. I agree to't,</HI> the Pre&s;ident an&s;wer'd; <HI>but you are going to &s;et me at odds with my Wife. She is jealous to the utmo&s;t extremity; and as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hall be per&s;waded, like others, that I vi&s;it Madam</HI> de Florange, <HI>I am very much afraid I &s;hall have little quiet at home. Let's lodg our Secret with
<PB N="154" REF="84"> her,</HI> an&s;wer'd <HI>Mainville</HI> then: <HI>'Tis the means of being all our Safeties. I have thought of that,</HI> reply'd the Pre&s;ident; <HI>but two things hinder'd me, one is, that &s;he can only conceal what &s;he does not know; the other, that it would not be hand&s;ome for me to en|gage her in this Intrigue. Thus it is much better to undergo her Jealou|&s;ie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mainville</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf Civil, by expre&s;&s;ing, that he would not purcha&s;e his own Content at the ex|pence of his Friend's. But the Pre|&s;ident made him an&s;wer. That no|thing could afford him more Joy, than the doing of him Service; and though he had &s;poke to him of his Wife's Humour, it was not to excu&s;e him&s;elf from the Bu&s;ine&s;s, but to take their mea&s;ures &s;o well, that they might keep their Concerns &s;e|cret. A Lover is ea&s;ie to per&s;wade, when it tends to his &s;atisfaction. Thus <HI>Mainville</HI> making but mean efforts to combate the Pre&s;ident's
<PB N="155" REF="84"> Civility, con&s;ented to all he requi|red. He then caus'd a Coachman and two Lacqueys, to be dre&s;t up in the Pre&s;ident's Colours; and when he went abroad, not a Per&s;on, but took him for the Pre&s;ident, by rea|&s;on of his Di&s;gui&s;e. And indeed, all People &s;aluted him in the Streets, principally tho&s;e that had any Pro|ce&s;s, pretending he would have &s;ome regard to their Civility, when he &s;hould come to try it. Howe|ver, for the better deceiving of them, he took care to conceal his Face with his Handkerchief, &s;o as that not any per&s;on living took no|tice of the Cheat; &s;o much the more, as that he never went to the Marchione&s;&s;es Hou&s;e, &s;ave when her Hu&s;band was gone to &s;olicite his Judges, which &s;he fail'd not of gi|ving him immediate notice of, that &s;o they might not lo&s;e the occa&s;ion of &s;eeing one another.</P>
<P>This he &s;ped in for five or &s;ix times, without Fortune's playing
<PB N="156" REF="85"> him any ill Prank; but <HI>Florange</HI>'s Parties being allarum'd at the&s;e fre|quent Vi&s;its, de&s;ired the Pre&s;ident thereupon, to decline being of their Judges, giving him to under&s;tand, that vi&s;iting Madam <HI>de Florange</HI> &s;o often as he did, he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Tryal of their Suit, without giving them a great Su&s;picion. The Pre&s;ident could ea&s;ily have unde|ceiv'd them if he would, but that not being to be done, without di&s;|covering his Friend's Secret, he &s;ought out &s;orry Excu&s;es for the Vi|&s;its tho&s;e Parties fancy'd he made to the Marchione&s;s. Thus he reply'd upon them, that they were very much in the wrong, in &s;u&s;pecting him of any partiality: That the &s;ee|ing of a Woman did not render him the le&s;s hone&s;t man: That every Individual had his Con&s;cience to keep: That it was not a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on again&s;t his being a Judge at their Trial: and that on the con|trary, he was re&s;olv'd to be on the
<PB N="157" REF="85"> Bench, to &s;hew how wrongfully they were allarum'd. He thought thereby to &s;erve <HI>Mainville,</HI> who had de&s;ired him to embrace <HI>Florange</HI>'s Intere&s;ts as his own. But the&s;e Par|ties thinking them&s;elves lo&s;t without Remedy, after this Declaration, con|triv'd to blaze about, in &s;uch man|ner, the Pre&s;ident's and Marchione&s;|&s;es Intrigue, as to oblige him to be the fir&s;t to draw off him&s;elf. They had heard &s;ince they were in the Town, that the Pre&s;idents Wife was extreamly jealous, and that upon the lea&s;t appearance of her Hus|band's Infidelity, &s;he was wont to make an horrible bu&s;tle. Thus they fancy'd, that they needed only to in|timate the Pre&s;ident's Vi&s;its to her under hand, and that after this the Intrigue he had with the Marchio|ne&s;s would quickly be publick.</P>
<P>Having form'd this Re&s;olution, they &s;ignify'd to the Pre&s;ident's La|dy what they were de&s;irous &s;he &s;hould know: and this News made
<PB N="158" REF="86"> her almo&s;t mad. She immediately loaded her Hu&s;band with a thou&s;and Reproaches for this new Inclinati|on, and would needs oblige him to promi&s;e her never to go more to her Lodgings. <HI>She's a profe&s;s'd Go&s;&s;ip,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to him, <HI>and your frequenting of her Company is only to abu&s;e me.</HI> The Pre&s;ident was at a very great lo&s;s how to quiet this Woman, whom he knew hard to be govern'd upon that Article. He endeavour'd to per&s;wade her, that he &s;aw Madam <HI>de Florange</HI> only out of re&s;pect; and that if her Concerns had not been recom|mended to him by all her Friends, he would pay her no more Vi&s;its. But his Lady falling into a Rage, and &s;o much the more, as that he would not promi&s;e her to &s;ee her no more, &s;he re&s;olv'd to manife&s;t her Jealou&s;ie in &s;uch manner, as that Madam <HI>de Florange</HI> &s;hould be ob|lig'd to forbid him her Hou&s;e.</P>
<PB N="159" REF="86">
<P>While that the Pre&s;ident's Lady was thus preparing to di&s;turb the&s;e Lovers Repo&s;e, Fortune, that had &s;par'd them &s;ince they had been at <HI>Rouen,</HI> contriv'd to play them a Prank, which they had all the trouble imaginable to free them|&s;elves from. One Day that <HI>Flo|range</HI> had cho&s;en to &s;ee his Judg|es, he was taken with an Indi&s;po&s;i|tion on the Way, that oblig'd him to return home &s;ooner than he ex|pected. He found the Pre&s;ident's Coach at his Door, and was migh|tily pleas'd with the Honour he did him of coming to &s;ee his Wife, as judging thence he would do his be&s;t for him, when his Cau&s;e came to a Trial. Wherefore he mu&s;t needs pay him his Acknowledg|ments: But at his entrance into the Marchione&s;&s;es Chamber, he was much &s;urpriz'd to find a man before her upon his Knees. The Marchi|one&s;s &s;eeing him come in, was &s;till more &s;urpriz'd than he: for it was
<PB N="160" REF="87"> <HI>Mainville,</HI> who in the Pre&s;ident's Robes, made her a thou&s;and amo|rous Prote&s;tations. <HI>Florange</HI> had luckily made a &s;top one moment, to con&s;ider upon the manner of his Behaviour in &s;o extraordinary an occa&s;ion. The Marchione&s;s em|ploy'd that &s;mall time to great advantage: For judging that <HI>Flo|range</HI> could not have &s;een <HI>Main|ville,</HI> his Back being towards him. <HI>Ah, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her Lo|ver, <HI>all my Remedies are u&s;ele&s;s, and you'l cover me all with Blood, unle&s;s you put your Handkerchief before your No&s;e. Mainville,</HI> who had an infinite &s;tock of Wit, ap|prehended by the&s;e Words, that <HI>Florange</HI> mu&s;t needs be behind him, and &s;econding the Marchi|one&s;&s;es Artifice, he took an Hand|kerchief out of her Hands, with which &s;he had rubb'd her &s;elf, and which luckily for them, was all o|ver Blood, as having her &s;elf bled at the No&s;e but a moment be|fore.
<PB N="161" REF="87"> Then <HI>Mainville</HI> cover'd his Face with it; and <HI>Florange</HI> &s;ee|ing him in this Condition, was not &s;orry that he was &s;o mode|rate, as thinking he had been un|&s;ea&s;onably allarum'd. Thus in|&s;tead of quarrelling him, as he had re&s;olv'd to do a moment be|fore, he made him a Complement upon his feigned Indi&s;po&s;ition, bid|ding his Wife &s;end for a clean Hand|kerchief, and fair Water, to wa&s;h his Face.</P>
<P><HI>Mainville</HI> was in &s;ome &s;ort of Se|curity, through the Marchione&s;&s;es Artifice: but &s;eeing that <HI>Florange</HI> was &s;o very officious to &s;erve him again&s;t his Will, he knew not yet how he &s;hould get off from this Affair, when Fortune freed him by a Circum&s;tance that in all like|lihood &s;hould have ruin'd him. The Pre&s;ident's Lady pa&s;s'd through the Street, and &s;eeing her Hus|band's Coach at the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Florange</HI>'s Door, &s;he immedi|ately
<PB N="162" REF="88"> re&s;olv'd to go in, her Jea|lou&s;ie in&s;piring her with a thou|&s;and extravagant things. Madam <HI>de Florange</HI> knew her not; but &s;eeing an hand&s;ome Woman come into her Room, and who &s;eem'd a Per&s;on of Quality, &s;he went to|wards her, to pay her her Civilities. The Pre&s;ident's Lady &s;tept back, with a &s;cornful look, and then u|&s;ing her Tongue; <HI>You ought, Ma|dam, to be &s;atisfy'd,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her, <HI>with care&s;&s;ing my Husband, without loading me with your fond|ne&s;&s;es. The Traitor is oftner with you than with me; and I de&s;ign henceforward to &s;end all tho&s;e that have to do with him, to your Hou&s;e.</HI> After this, &s;he fell to loading <HI>Mainville</HI> with a thou|&s;and Reproaches, taking him for her Hu&s;band, as being decei|ved by his Garb and Wigg, that was of the Pre&s;ident's Co|lour.</P>
<PB N="163" REF="88">
<P>However, <HI>Mainville</HI> &s;aid not one word; which made the La|dy the more believe it to be the Pre&s;ident, and that finding him|&s;elf culpable, he dur&s;t &s;ay nothing in his own excu&s;e. Thus his Si|lence was a new Crime for him: She continued upon the &s;ame Tone; and after &s;he had pretty well di&s;charg'd her Choler, &s;he took him by the Gown; &s;aying, &s;he would rather &s;tay there as long as &s;he liv'd, than go away without him. <HI>Mainville,</HI> who would willingly have given all things to have been away from thence, made u&s;e of this occa&s;i|on to be gone; and being entred with her into his Coach, he on the way, underwent all that a Woman can &s;ay that thinks her &s;elf &s;lighted. <HI>Thou do&s;t well to hide thy &s;elf, thou Cheat,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to him: <HI>But that Handkerchief thou hold'st before thy face, does not hide from me the Motions of
<PB N="164" REF="89"> thy Heart. I know whom thou ad|dre&s;&s;e&s;t thy Vows to; and all the Care&s;&s;es thou &s;ometimes make&s;t me, are only for the better deceiving me.</HI> In &s;aying this, &s;he &s;natch'd his Handkerchief from off his No&s;e: But her Surprize pa&s;s'd beyond all that I can &s;ay, when in&s;tead of her Hu&s;band &s;he &s;aw a man &s;he did not know. For out of certain Con&s;iderations, the Pre|&s;ident had not let her &s;ee <HI>Main|ville,</HI> though he &s;taid in his Hou&s;e; and when &s;he had ask'd him the Rea&s;on of it, he had &s;topp'd her mouth, by telling her, that there were certain things which Women ought not to know. In the mean while, <HI>Mainville</HI>'s Di&s;order was no le&s;s in this Occa&s;ion, than that of the Pre&s;ident's Ladies; but being &s;ooner recollected, <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid he to her, <HI>I know that this Adventure &s;urprizes you: I be&s;eecb you not to let it be known, and you will here|in oblige a Man of Quality, who
<PB N="165" REF="89"> is my Lord, your Husband's friend, and a peculiar Servant of all that regards him. I would now tell your Lady&s;hip,</HI> continued he, <HI>what has induc'd me to di&s;gui&s;e my &s;elf as I am; but it is better that you be in|form'd of all from his own Mouth, becau&s;e, that not having the Honour to be known by you, all would be &s;u&s;picious I might &s;ay to your Lady|&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while, the Coach jogg'd on, and they at length got home, without any other illu&s;trati|on than this. The Pre&s;ident was then in the Court of his Hou&s;e. He was &s;trangely amaz'd to &s;ee <HI>Mainville</HI> with his Wife; and ma|king up to them, to know how this came to pa&s;s, he was &s;till in a greater maze, when <HI>Mainville</HI> had told him a&s;ide, all that had befallen him. <HI>This is a bad Bu|&s;ine&s;s,</HI> &s;aid the Pre&s;ident to him; <HI>and knowing my Wife's Humour, &s;he cannot fail of blabbing it abroad.</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="90"> However, to top upon her, he told her, that <HI>Mainville</HI> was a man of Quality, who was hamper'd in great troubles; and that it imported his Life, that People &s;hould not know of his being in Town: That there|fore he be&s;ought her not to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it to any Body: and that this was the Rea&s;on that had in|duc'd him to give him a Retreat at his Hou&s;e, without telling her of it. <HI>You think me but an ill Keeper of Secrets, Sir,</HI> &s;aid his Wife to him, as already &s;u&s;pecting the my|&s;tery; <HI>and all People have not &s;o bad an Opinion of Women as you, &s;ince that this Gentleman him&s;elf does not conceal him&s;elf from Madam</HI> de Flo|range. <HI>Madam</HI> de Florange, the Pre&s;ident reply'd to her, <HI>is a Rela|tion of his, and partakes in all that can befall him; in&s;omuch, that &s;he will be cautious of di&s;covering where he is.</HI> The Pre&s;ident's Lady, who was as malicious as any body li|ving, and who had plainly ob&s;erv'd
<PB N="167" REF="90"> how <HI>Mainville</HI> had hid him&s;elf from the Husband. <HI>I believe,</HI> &s;he an&s;wer'd the Pre&s;ident, <HI>that this Lady has &s;till more Intere&s;t than you &s;ay, in keeping your Friend's Con|cerns &s;ecret; but I very much doubt whether the Marquis</HI> de Florange <HI>has the &s;ame Regards for him.</HI> At the&s;e Words &s;he left them both there; and the Pre&s;ident knowing the &s;pightfulne&s;s of his Wife, ad|vis'd <HI>Mainville</HI> to leave the Town, for fear her Twattle being told a|gain to <HI>Florange,</HI> he might &s;u&s;pect the Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Mainville,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Plea&s;ure he took in &s;eeing his Mi|&s;tre&s;s, follow'd his Friends Advice, and departed <HI>Rouen.</HI> The Cam|paign began &s;hortly after, which &s;olac'd him for this Adventure, as finding in the Employs of War wherewith to make him forget for a while the Secrets of Love.</P>
