<P><HI>_WHereas heretofore Wee declared Our de&s;ires to haue</HI> brought to pa&s;&s;e as a principall worke of Our times, the Manu|factures of Dying and Dre&s;&s;ing of Broad-cloath within this Realme, and to that end did publi&s;h Our &s;euerall Proclamations, the one 23. <HI>Iulij Anno</HI> 12. of Our Reigne, the other 2. <HI>Decembr.</HI> fol|lowing, for the incouragement of &s;uch of Our Subiects as then vndertooke to &s;et vp and manage the &s;aid Trade; But finding that time di&s;couereth many inhabilities, which cannot at fir&s;t be &s;eene, and being willing to haue it knowne to all Our louing Subiects, that We intend not to in&s;i&s;t and &s;tay longer vpon &s;pecious and faire &s;hewes, which produce not the fruit Our acti|ons doe euer aime at, which is the generall good of this Our State and Kingdome: Where|fore perceiuing that the former grounds propo&s;ed to Vs, by the Vndertakers of that worke, con&s;i&s;ted more in hopes then in effects; and finding the worke it &s;elfe to bee too great to bee brought to pa&s;&s;e in any &s;hort time, by rea&s;on of the many difficulties accompanying the &s;ame, and that as the State of Trade now &s;tands, there will be greater lo&s;&s;e in the Cloth-making of the Kingdome, then gaine in the Dying and Dre&s;&s;ing thereof, which Wee may not &s;uffer, the commoditie of Broad-cloth being one of the principall Dowries of this Our State, and which hath brought great wealth and honour to the &s;ame; And hauing the experience of many ages to ground Our &s;elues vpon, that the ancient Company of the Merchants Ad|uenturers haue euer managed their Trade, as with profite to the Common wealth, &s;o with much prai&s;e to their Company, in taking off and venting the Cloathes of this Kingdome, whereby they de&s;erue both grace and encouragement from Vs. Therefore no longer to withdraw Our countenance from them, but to quicken and giue a new life vnto them, Wee doe hereby &s;ignifie and declare, that We haue already re&s;tored and giuen backe vnto them, all and euery their Charters, any wi&s;e touching their Incorporation, forme of gouernment, and Trade, or any Powers, Licences, Authorities, or priuiledges concerning the &s;ame; And them haue and doe hereby &s;ettle and redintigrate in their former e&s;tate and degree to all purpo&s;es: Willing it to be knowne that none of the Charters of the &s;aid Company, were euer by Vs an|nihilated, or by Law auoyded, but onely &s;u&s;pended and &s;eque&s;tred, till our further plea&s;ure
<PB REF="2"> knowne. And therefore we do by the&s;e pre&s;ents declare, con&s;titute, and ordaine, That the &s;aid Company of the Merchants Aduenturers &s;hall and may from henceforth practize, and put in execution all and euery their Powers, Licences, Authorities, Priuiledges and forme of go|uernment contained in all or any their Charters; and all v&s;ages, holding of Courts, mee|tings, a&s;&s;emblies, and all other proceedings by vertue of them or any of them, together with all the dependances, either in the parts beyond the Seas, or here within the Kingdome.</P>
<P>And further, We doe hereby intimate &amp; declare, letting it to be knowen to all forraine Prin|ces, and States, in who&s;e Dominions, the &s;aid Merchants Aduenturers now haue, or here|after &s;hall haue any recour&s;e in the exerci&s;e of their Trade: That (notwith&s;tanding any for|mer &s;ignification of Our plea&s;ure otherwi&s;e) We haue againe fully, and really enabled them to maintaine, hold, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, and enioy all and euery their former Immunities, Rights, Powers, and Priuiledges in any forraine parts beyond the Seas, with free libertie &amp; power as heretofore, to deale, contract, and agree with any Prince, State, or City in Germany, or the Low-countries, for and touching any further, or other priuiledges to be had and obtained in tho&s;e parts touching their Trade: Hereby giuing, granting, and allowing, vnto the &s;aid Merchants Aduenturers, from time to time, free liberty and choice to make and appoint &s;uch and &s;o many places of their re&s;idence in forraine parts, as to them &s;hall &s;eeme conueni|ent; And tho&s;e at their plea&s;ure to change and remooue, as &s;hall and may &s;tand be&s;t with their commoditie and profite. And, that the &s;aid Merchants Aduenturers, may henceforth goe on and exerci&s;e their &s;aid Trade, with better confidence and encouragement, which is be&s;t effected by remouing and di&s;charging all impediments: Wee doe by the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;traightly prohibit, forbid, con&s;titute, and ordaine, That from henceforth no Interloper, nor other per&s;on or per&s;ons, not free of the &s;aid Company, pre&s;ume in any wi&s;e to meddle, or intromit directly, or indirectly in the Trade, or Priuiledges of the &s;aid Company, vpon paine of Our high Indignation, and &s;uch other paines, and penalties, as by the Charters of the &s;aid Com|pany, or any of them are or &s;hall be prouided for tran&s;gre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rs in that kind. Which that it may haue the better effect, Wee doe hereby &s;traightly charge and command all Maiors, Shiriffes, Bailiffs, Con&s;tables; e&s;pecially all Cu&s;tomers and Searchers, and other Officers of Our Cu&s;tomes, a&s;well in the Port of London, as in all other Ports of this Kingdome; That they be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the &s;aid Company, and the Officers thereof in the execution of their &s;aid Charters, and that they nor any of them in their &s;eueral places, pa&s;&s;e out any goods or Merchandizes into any the parts of Germanie, or the Low-countries, nor into any other parts beyond the Seas, where the &s;aid Company now haue, or hereafter &s;hall haue any priui|ledges granted vnto them contrary to the true meaning of their &s;aid Charters, vpon paine of Our di&s;plea&s;ure, and the lo&s;&s;e of his or their Offices that &s;hall offend therein.</P>
