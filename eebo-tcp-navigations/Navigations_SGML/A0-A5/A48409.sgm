<HEAD><HI>A Short Te&s;timony of the Life, Travels, Sufferings, and Death of that Faithful Servant of the Lord,</HI> Robert Widders.</HEAD>
<P>WHo was Born in <HI>&V;pper-Kellet</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> of hone&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial Parentage, who was a Seeker after the Lord, and the knowledge of his way, and wandred from Mountain to Hill, but could find no re&s;t nor &s;atisfaction to my Soul, till it plea&s;ed the Lord God, that in the year 1652. Dear <HI>George Fox</HI> came into the&s;e parts, who informed my mind, and turned me to the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us in my inward parts, which was comfort to me that had long &s;at in darkne&s;s, and &s;o I was convinced of Gods pure eternal Truth.</P>
<P>And in the year 1653. I and <HI>George Fox,</HI> and <HI>James Lanca&s;ter</HI> pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where I and <HI>James Lanca&s;ter</HI> went to <HI>Emelton</HI> Steeple-hou&s;e
<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e.</NOTE> and I &s;poke to the Prie&s;t and People in publique, and charged them in the pre&s;ence of God, that if any of them could tell what would become of their Souls, if they &s;hould be cut off that pre|&s;ent, let them then &s;peak; but never a one of them dur&s;t open their Mouthes.</P>
<P>Then the next Fir&s;t Day,
<NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e.</NOTE> I was moved to go to <HI>Coldbeck</HI> Steeple-hou&s;e, where I &s;poke to Prie&s;t <HI>Hut|ton</HI> when he was in his High-place&mdash; And the rude people his Hearers did throw me down among the Seats, and drag|ged, and trailed me forth into the Yard, and threw me down up|on the Ground, and pun&s;hed and beat me till the blood gu&s;hed out at my mouth, and I lay for dead &s;ome time&mdash;But a woman took pity and held up my head, till my breath and life came to me again, as &s;ome &s;aid that &s;tood by: Ever ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God, who up|held and &s;trengthened me by his eternal power, that I was not di&s;|mayed, nor di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>For on the &s;ame day in the afternoon I went &s;even Miles to <HI>Ackton</HI> Steeple hou&s;e,
<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e.</NOTE> where I &s;poke to Prie&s;t <HI>Nicholls</HI> of <HI>Ackton</HI> in his High-place, and &s;aid, <HI>Come
<PB N="4" REF="3">down thou Deceiver, thou enemy of Chri&s;t, the hand of the Lord is again&s;t thee</HI>&mdash;And one <HI>William Bri&s;co</HI> of <HI>Crofton</HI> then pre&s;ent, a Ju&s;tice, commanded the Con&s;tables to &s;ecure me; and after exa|mined me in the Prie&s;ts Hou&s;e; and the Prie&s;t <HI>Nicholls</HI> flattered and fawned upon me. And I told him, The Spirit of Per&s;ecution lodged in him; he &s;aid <HI>Nay,</HI> he was no &s;uch man.</P>
<P>Then pre&s;ently after he &s;aid to the Ju&s;tice, I had &s;toln my Hor&s;e, and that he could find in his heart to be my Executioner with his own hands.&mdash;Then I told him again, Did not I &s;ay unto thee, That the Spirit of Per&s;ecution lodged in thee: So the &s;aid Ju&s;tice. <HI>Bri&s;co</HI> made a Warrant to &s;end me to <HI>Carlile</HI> Goal; and after he had given the Warrant to the Con&s;table, he called me before him again, and asked me by what Authority, or Power, I came to Seduce and be|witch People.&mdash;I told him, I came not to Seduce and bewitch Peo|ple, but I came in that Power which &s;hall make thee, and all the Powers of the Earth bend and bow before it (to wit) the mighty Power of God. And as I &s;pake the&s;e words from the word, the Terrour and Dread of God took hold upon him, and &s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">te his heart: Then he called for his Warrant again out of the Con&s;tables hand, and cau&s;ed the Con&s;table to put me on to a <HI>Moor,</HI> near Night.&mdash;So the Lord delivered me at that time.</P>
<P>But not long after was I moved of the Lord to go to the &s;aid <HI>Ack|ton-Steeple Hou&s;e</HI> again, where the &s;aid Ju&s;tice <HI>Bri&s;co</HI> had Power to &s;end me to the Common-Goal at <HI>Carlile;</HI>
<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="marg">Pri&s;on.</NOTE> where I didly in the Dungeon among Thieves a long time, and never came out Night nor Day till I was relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Then afterwards I went to <HI>Lamplough Steeple-Hou&s;e</HI> and &s;poke to the Prie&s;t,
<NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e</NOTE> and People; and they were very Rude, and tore the Hair off my Head, and rent my Coat.</P>
<P>And in the Afternoon the &s;ame Day, I went to another Steeple Hou&s;e two Miles from thence,
<NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e.</NOTE> and &s;poke to the Prie&s;t: but he went away and would not &s;tay.</P>
<P>Afterward I was with <HI>G.</HI>
<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e.</NOTE> <HI>F.</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and went there to a Steeple-Hou&s;e, called, <HI>New Munckland.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, as I came back, I was at a Steeple Hou&s;e in <HI>Northumberland,</HI>
<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="marg">Steeple-Hou&s;e.</NOTE> and there &s;poke to the People: And one <HI>Henry Harbuttle</HI> and his Wife were Con|vinced that Day.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>And in <HI>Bi&s;hoprick</HI> I was at &s;everal Steeple-Hou&s;es. And in <HI>Bi&s;hopaukland</HI> I &s;peaking thorow the Town,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Stee|ple-Hou&s;es.</NOTE> the People &s;toned me with Stones, and brui&s;ed my Head very Sore.</P>
<P>And likewi&s;e in <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> where particularly I was at a Steeple-Hou&s;e near <HI>Skipton,</HI> and &s;poke to Prie&s;t <HI>Web&s;ter,</HI> and bid him come down thou Inchanter, for he was a fal&s;e Man, for he had been partly convinced and turned back again, <HI>Simon Magus</HI> like. I al&s;o &s;poke to the people, and to one Ju&s;tice <HI>Coats,</HI> a moderate man then being pre&s;ent: And I directed them to the Word of God in the heart, which divided between the precious and the vile.</P>
<P>And then I went to a Moor &s;ide, where a few Friends were gather|ed together; and I &s;at down among them, and it was immediately revealed to me, that the &s;aid Ju&s;tice <HI>Coats</HI> would &s;end for me.&mdash;And pre&s;ently there came many Hor&s;e men and Foot, and &s;aid I mu&s;t go before the Ju&s;tice, who examined me, and &s;aid I had broken the Law in di&s;turbing the Mini&s;ter and People, and he might &s;end me to Gaol at <HI>York</HI> Ca&s;tle.&mdash;I An&s;wered, Send me to <HI>York</HI> Ca&s;tle if thou dur&s;t; for to that of God in thy Con&s;cience am I made manife&s;t. Then &s;aid he, I neither dare nor will: So took me by the Hand, and told me, I might take my own time.&mdash;And &s;o the Lord pre&s;erved and delivered me, for which I prai&s;e his Holy Name.</P>
<P>And al&s;o, I was at &s;everal Steeple Hou&s;es in <HI>Lanca|&s;hire,</HI> as <HI>Warton, Halton, Kellet,</HI> and <HI>Arkholm</HI> Chapel,

<P>And at the A&s;&s;ize time at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> I went to the Steeple Hou&s;e and &s;poke to the Prie&s;t, whil&s;t he was Preaching before the Judges; and the Prie&s;t was all in a Fright, and Smitten, and broke Up, and the People in a ha&s;t hurried out.</P>
<P>So the Lord God everla&s;tingly Delivered, Kept, and Pre&s;erved me by his Everla&s;ting Power in all my Travels, and Exerci&s;es of this kind; Ble&s;&s;ed be his Holy Glorious Name for ever.</P>

<P>THis Te&s;timony I have to give for my dear and truly loving Hu&s;|band, That his Love was true and &s;incere to God, and for the pro&s;perity of his ble&s;&s;ed Truth was zealous.&mdash;He was a man (ever &s;ince it plea&s;ed God to joyn him and me together as Man and Wife) that was inclining to &s;eek after the Lord.

<P>THis Te&s;timony I have to bear concerning my dear and Loving Father, who is Decea&s;ed, for whom I ever had a Reverent e&s;teem, and that upon a double account, Fir&s;t, as he was a tender natural Father unto me. Secondly, as he was an Example of a holy Life and Conver&s;ation, and good Advice and Coun&s;el to me. Al&s;o he was &s;incere and zealous for the propagation of the Name and Truth of God in his Day, which I know by true experience, was the de&s;ire of his heart, that all who took upon them the profe&s;&s;ion of the

I have known him, and been conver&s;ant with him Thirty four years, and we were made partakers of the eternal Truth near together, in the beginning of the infancy of Truth among us, now in out Age, when the Morning Stars Sang together. He was called forth to the &s;ervice of the Lord early in this glorious Day that hath ever &s;ince &s;hined upon us, glory be to the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s for ever. He went forth in the power and demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and turned many unto God early in his Day. He was of a quick under&s;tanding, and the Gift of the Spirit of di&s;cerning was plentifully be&s;towed upon him. And tho he was not very much in Declaration, yet I know, and many al&s;o can bear Witne&s;s and Te&s;timony, that his very pre&s;ence and counte|nance, and eye was refre&s;hment and comfort unto them, and that the witne&s;s of God in their hearts would have an&s;wered his appearance, the power of the Lord was &s;o quick and lively in him.

He left his Wife and Family, and took his Life in his hand and went Joyfully to the &s;ervice of the Lord. And when he went fir&s;t forth into <HI>Cumberland</HI> and thereawaies, he was beaten, and &s;toned, and knocked down. O! the Impri&s;onments, and cold Winters that he pa&s;&s;ed thorow; &s;o that his body was &s;o &s;tarved, that he never quite recovered while he lived. He gave his back freely to the Smiter upon every occa&s;ion, and now in the latterend of his daies, the Tythe-mongers fell upon his outward E&s;tate, and &s;wept away many of his Goods; and when he had a little more together, the Tythe-monger and the Informers came again and fetched it away:

F.</HI> with others to declare his Name and his Truth, and his Go&s;pel, and the way of Peace, Life and Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which indeed was the greate&s;t joy and &s;atisfaction to many a Soul in the&s;e parts, that ever they met with, who had been &s;eeking after the Lord his peace, po|wer and pre&s;ence, which now many hath found, and lived in, and hath fini&s;hed their time and cour&s;e here, to the laying down of their Heads in peace with God, to whom be prai&s;e for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Widders</HI> owned the Truth above 34 years; he was a Man zealous of mind, and fervent in Spirit, and true in Heart to &s;erve the Lord God faithfully all his days, after he was turned to the Lord and to his eternal Truth.&mdash;He was &s;teadfa&s;t in Faith, and of a &s;ound judgment, and deep di&s;cerning, who vi&s;ited many in Sick|ne&s;s of body, and them that were in trouble of Con&s;cience, and had a true di&s;cerning of their &s;piritual conditions, and could have &s;poken a word in &s;ea&s;on &s;utable to them: And to tho&s;e that were innocent, and truly de&s;irous after good, he was loving and tender, and of a chearful Countenance.&mdash;But to the Hypocrites, and fal&s;e in Heart, he was &s;harp, and thre&s;hing, having the Spirit of Judgment, &s;o that his Spirit might often have been known by his Countenance.</P>
<P>But he greatly loved Unity among&s;t Brethren in the Spirit, and power of the Lord God.&mdash;And he was one that cho&s;ed rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea&s;ure of Sin, and of this world for a &s;ea&s;on: For as it may be &s;een before in this little Book, he was a great Sufferer both in Impri&s;onment and &s;poiling of Goods: For his Te&s;timony to the Truth, and for keeping his Con&s;cience clear, he was freely given up, and faithful and true in, and thorow them all, well knowing that the Doctrine of Je&s;us was and is true: Ble&s;&s;ed are the&s;e that &s;uffer Per&s;ecution for Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven; and had rather have &s;uffered much, than that the Lord, and his holy Truth &s;hould be di&s;honoured, or his people evil &s;poken of.</P>
<P>And now he hath fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and kept the Faith, having
<PB N="20" REF="11">lived in the Truth, and dyed in the Lord (Aged about &s;ixty eight years) and ble&s;&s;ed are &s;uch for they Re&s;t from their Labour, and their Works follow them;&mdash;And he is gone as to his natural Life, but his Spirit and Life &s;piritually yet remaineth, and lives; as <HI>He that believeth in me,</HI> &s;aid Je&s;us, <HI>hath everla&s;ting Life:</HI> And this is the will of him that &s;ent me. That every one which &s;eeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everla&s;ting Life, and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day: And he that liveth, and believeth in me &s;hall never die.</P>
<P>And the Saints in the Apo&s;tles days, had a Life hid with Chri&s;t in God, who were come to the Spirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, to the general a&s;&s;embly, and Church of the fir&s;t-born, who&s;e Names are written in Heaven: And to God the judge of all, to whom all mu&s;t give account, and who is the ju&s;t rewarder of all, according to their deeds done in the Body, be they good or evil.&mdash;And we that yet remain in the Body, God Almighty keep and pre&s;erve us faithful and true to him, to his Glory, to the end of our days, and to our eternal Peace and Felicity, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

And many ble&s;&s;ed and precious Meetings we had both among Friends and Friendly People, and the <HI>Indian</HI> Emperours, Kings, and Councils of their People. And the Lord by his power pre&s;erved us from the Pyrats and Robbers on the Sea, who were very many at that time, and brought him well home to his Wife. And he was both an Elder and Pillar, and one of God's Valiants in his heavenly <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who died in the Divine, Holy, and Precious Faith, which was his Victory in all his inward and outward Sufferings, who did not account his Life dear for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, as knowing that they that Die with him, &s;hall Live with him; and they which Suffer with him, &s;hall Reign with him, and ble&s;&s;ed are they that die in the Lord, they Re&s;t from their Labour, and their Works follow them, as certainly this Faithful <HI>Robert Widders</HI> did; and tho the lo&s;s of his outward pre&s;ence to his dear Wife and Family is great, yet they may be glad in the Lord they enjoy him in the Spirit; For Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>He that believeth in me, tho he were dead, yet he &s;hall Live</HI> (mark Live) <HI>and who&s;oever Liveth and believeth in me, &s;hall never die,</HI> John 11.25, 26. For he that believeth in Chri&s;t hath eternal and everla&s;ting Life, a Life in Chri&s;t that &s;hall never die, tho they do put off their outward Tabernacle or Earthly Hou&s;e, <HI>Yet they know they have a Build|ing of God, a Hou&s;e not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. And of this I do believe our dear Friend and Brother <HI>Robert Widders</HI> had an A&s;&s;urance; and &s;o I am &s;atisfied that he is well in the Lord: Unto Him for ever be Glory, who is, and hath been, and will be the Support, Succour. Refre&s;her, Strength, and Up|holder of all his People: Glory over all be unto Him and His Holy Name forever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
