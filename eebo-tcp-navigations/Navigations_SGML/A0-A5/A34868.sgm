<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Worthy and much honoured,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF the Dedication of this poor Work unto you, may carry with it any intimation of the great Re&s;pect and Honour I have for you, I de&s;ire the world &s;hould under&s;tand the ground of it; which is not &s;o much the emi|nency of your Quality and outward Condi|tion (though that al&s;o de&s;erves its due value and regard) as your eminent Piety and Vertue, which renders you truly honourable, and at|tracts the e&s;teem of all good men. And truly I cannot but look upon it as a great te&s;timony of the Divine favour to that <HI>Noble Family</HI> to which you are all &s;o nearly related, and a great honour to it, That in an Age &s;o corrupt and depraved as this is, there &s;hould be found in it
<PB REF="3"> &s;o many Per&s;ons more <HI>ennobled</HI> by their <HI>Virtue</HI> than their <HI>High Birth;</HI> and more <HI>great</HI> in <HI>Good|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>real Worth,</HI> than in <HI>E&s;tate.</HI> May the Ble&s;&s;ing of God Almighty ever re&s;t on You and your Families, and make you &s;till great Examples of all that is good and prai&s;e-worthy, in the places where you live; that when you &s;hall have fini&s;hed your cour&s;e, and &s;erved your Ge|neration here according to the will of God, and are entred into your everla&s;ting Re&s;t, your Names may be to the &s;ucceeding Age as a <HI>Per|fume</HI> poured forth.</P>
<P>As for what concerns this Work, you may plea&s;e to under&s;tand, That it is the fruit of &s;ome of my hours of lei&s;ure and retirement, of which I have had more of late years than ever I de&s;ired or expected. And &s;urely <HI>tam otii quam negotii reddenda e&s;t ratio,</HI> as he &s;aid: We mu&s;t give account to God of our times of lei&s;ure, as well as of tho&s;e of publick and vi&s;ible em|ployment. For tho&s;e &s;everal years la&s;t pa&s;t, wherein I have been confined to privacy, I have addicted my &s;elf to the &s;erious &s;tudy of the Holy Scriptures, not finding any way wherein I could better employ my time. For where can we find that profit, that delight, that comfort in afflictions, which may be reaped from a diligent peru&s;al and &s;erious meditation on tho&s;e Sacred and Divinely-in&s;pir'd Writings? I have often thought with my &s;elf, that a &s;hort and plain Analytical Paraphra&s;e and Expo&s;i|tion of them, might be of great u&s;e to tho&s;e
<PB REF="3"> who have not lei&s;ure to read larger Comments. And accordingly I have bent my pains to &s;erve them therein, as I was able. If my poor endea|vours may be any ways &s;erviceable to the Church of God, I &s;hall rejoyce. However, as our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;aid in excu&s;e of <HI>Mary</HI> when &s;he was blamed for pouring her Box of precious Ointment on his Head (<HI>Mar.</HI> 14.4, &amp;c.), <HI>Let her alone, &s;he hath done what &s;he could;</HI> intimating, that if &s;he had known how to ex|pre&s;s her high veneration and affection to Him in a better manner, &s;he would have willingly done it: So I hope I may in &s;ome mea&s;ure of &s;incerity and uprightne&s;s &s;ay, that <HI>I have done what I could.</HI> If I had known how to do any thing better for the &s;ervice of God and His Church, in the Circum&s;tances wherein I have of late years been ca&s;t, I hope I &s;hould have readily done it. But &s;eeing I did not, I have (humbly imploring the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance) ad|ventured on this.</P>
<P>'Tis well known, that there is nothing in this world more plea&s;ing and cheering to the eyes, than <HI>Light;</HI> in&s;omuch that one elegantly calls it <HI>The &s;mile of Nature.</HI> And in like manner, to the Mind and Under&s;tanding of man, there is nothing more plea&s;ing and delightful than a clear di&s;covery of <HI>Truth.</HI> But of all Truths, there are none can be &s;o acceptable, &s;o delight|ful and ravi&s;hing, as <HI>tho&s;e glorious Truths</HI> revealed by God in his holy Word, which tend &s;o much to the bettering of <HI>man</HI> here, and to the bring|ing
<PB REF="4"> of him to eternal happine&s;s hereafter. And truly I am very confident, would Per&s;ons of Quality and Education more diligently read and &s;tudy the Holy Scriptures, they would find &s;uch incomparable delight, &s;weetne&s;s, and comfort in them, that <HI>Play-books</HI> and <HI>Romances,</HI> and &s;uch corrupting and effeminating Tra&s;h (which con&s;ume the precious hours of too many of our Gentry) would &s;eem vile and contemptible in their eyes. But I need not &s;ay the&s;e things to you, who know how better to employ your time, and have learned to prefer <HI>Manna</HI> before Onions and Garlick.</P>
<P>All that I &s;hall further trouble you with, is only to acquaint you, That &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> ventu|ring this poor thing of mine into a World &s;o full of Cen&s;ure and Prejudice, I find my &s;elf inclin'd to put up &s;ome &s;uch Petition unto God for it, as that excellent per&s;on, Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> put up for his Divine Poems:</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately publi&s;hed the intire Hi&s;tory of our <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed Lord and Saviour,</HI> from his Birth to his glorious <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> to Heaven; it will not be, I hope, unaccep|table to thee, if I here pre&s;ent thee with the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Church</HI> immediately &s;ucceeding; and give thee a Narrative of the <HI>Acts, Labours, Travels, Sermons, Di&s;cour&s;es, Miracles, Suc|ce&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the Holy Apo&s;tles, as they are record|ed by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Luke</HI> in that Divine Book of his, call'd the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>And that my De&s;ign in this undertaking may the more clearly be di&s;cerned, be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand, that I have dige&s;ted the whole Work into <HI>Seven Chapters.</HI></P>
<P>The FIRST CHAPTER contains the Acts of all the Apo|&s;tles <HI>joyntly,</HI> from our Saviour's A&s;cen&s;ion to <HI>Saul</HI>'s <HI>Conver&s;ion;</HI> and &s;hews what was done by them <HI>before</HI> the Fea&s;t of Pente|co&s;t, <HI>at</HI> the Fea&s;t, and <HI>after</HI> it. (1.) <HI>Before the Fea&s;t;</HI> it &s;hews how they continued in joynt-devotion for ten days together at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in expectation of the great <HI>promi&s;ed effu&s;ion</HI> of the Spirit; and during that time, called <HI>Matthias</HI> by lot to the Apo&s;tle&s;hip in the room of <HI>Judas [Acts</HI> chap. I.] 2. <HI>At the Fea&s;t;</HI> it &s;hews how they received a <HI>plentiful effu&s;ion</HI> of the Spirit, and &s;pake <HI>divers Tongues;</HI> at which &s;ome of the <HI>Jews</HI> mocking, <HI>Peter</HI> preached an excellent Sermon to them, which had &s;uch wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, that by his own and the other A|po&s;tles endeavours, about Three thou&s;and were that day con|verted to Chri&s;t [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. II.]. (3.) <HI>After the Fea&s;t;</HI> it relates how <HI>PETER</HI> going up to the Temple with <HI>John,</HI> he there
<PB REF="5"> miraculou&s;ly cured a <HI>Cripple.</HI> The people being filled with amazement and a&s;toni&s;hment at this <HI>miracle, Peter</HI> informs them, That it was not wrought by any power of his own, but by the power of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And from hence he takes occa&s;ion to preach Chri&s;t to them (Chap. III.). The <HI>Rulers</HI> of the Jews being offended at his Sermon (though a great number of the people were converted thereby), apprehend <HI>him</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and bring them before the <HI>Council,</HI> who after examination di&s;|mi&s;s them, yet with a charge not to preach any more in the Name of Je&s;us. The Church hereupon betake them&s;elves to prayer, and receive a pre&s;ent and gracious an&s;wer from the Lord. Next it &s;hews, how holy and gracious the conver&s;ation of this Infant Church was, who convers'd together with great concord and charity, the rich &s;elling their goods for the &s;u|&s;tentation of the poorer &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. IV.] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">es the fraud and hypocri&s;ie of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> dreadful puni&s;hment; as al&s;o the many wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> wrought by the Apo&s;tles, to the terror of &s;ome, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">e con|ver&s;ion of others; and their couragious per&s;i&s;ting to preach Chri&s;t, notwith&s;tanding they were per&s;ecuted, impri&s;oned, and beaten for it [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. V.].</P>
<P>In the next place it &s;ets forth how the Apo&s;tles appointed Seven <HI>Deacons</HI> to take care of the poor, whereof <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> were the mo&s;t eminent, who&s;e particular acts are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ia|ted; as namely, <HI>Stephen</HI>'s di&s;puting with &s;ome of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nagogue of the <HI>Libertines,</HI> who (not being able to <HI>re&s;i&s;t the wi&s;dom and &s;pirit by which he &s;pake</HI>) drew him before the <HI>Council,</HI> and and there fal&s;ly accu&s;ed him [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. VI.]. <HI>Stephen</HI> in a long and grave Oration defends him&s;elf, and pleads his Cau&s;e; but they interrupt him, and fall upon him, and &s;tone him [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. VII.].</P>
<P>Immediately after <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Martyrdom, a violent Per&s;ecution aro&s;e, which &s;cattered the Di&s;ciples at <HI>Jeru&s;alem. Philip</HI> here|upon went and preached Chri&s;t at <HI>Samaria,</HI> and did many Miracles there, and baptized many; and among the re&s;t, <HI>Simon Magus.</HI> The Apo&s;tles that were left at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> hearing of <HI>Philip</HI>'s good &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Samaria,</HI> &s;end <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> thither to confirm tho&s;e new Di&s;ciples, and to enlarge the Church. The&s;e two Apo&s;tles coming thither, they by <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>impo&s;ition of hands</HI> conferr the miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t on the true believers there; which <HI>Simon Magus</HI> &s;eeing he offered the Apo&s;tles money to enable him to confer the like gifts on whom&s;oever he plea&s;ed: for which impiety <HI>Peter</HI> &s;harply reproves him. La&s;tly, It &s;ets forth how <HI>Philip</HI> was &s;ent to in&s;truct and baptize the Eunuch [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. VIII].</P>
<P>The SECOND CHAPTER contains more particularly the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e two great Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> though there is in&s;erted al&s;o &s;omething concerning <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s journey to <HI>An|tioch,</HI> and the Martyrdom of <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>Now concerning <HI>PA&V;L,</HI> the&s;e things are here related: (1.) His
<PB REF="5"> miraculous Conver&s;ion. (2.) His Vocation to the Apo&s;tle&s;hip. (3.) His Preaching Chri&s;t fir&s;t in the Synagogues of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and then in <HI>Arabia</HI> for the &s;pace of three years. (4.) His re|turn to <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> and e&s;caping the hands of the Jews that there con&s;pired to kill him.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Peter,</HI> the&s;e things are recorded: (1.) The <HI>Mira|cles</HI> he wrought, namely, his healing <HI>Aeneas</HI> of the Pal&s;ie at <HI>Lydda,</HI> and rai&s;ing <HI>Tabitha</HI> from the dead at <HI>Joppa [Acts</HI> Chap. IX.] (2.) The <HI>Doctrine</HI> he preached to <HI>Cornelius</HI> (a <HI>Gentile</HI>) and his company, upon a particular vi&s;ion and command from God; whereupon the Holy Gho&s;t falleth on them, and they are baptized [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. X.]. This conver&s;e and communi|on of his with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he vindicates to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were &s;candaliz'd at it, by a narrative of the whole matter. Here al&s;o is in&s;erted a narration, how the Go&s;pel being &s;pread into <HI>Phoenice, Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI> by tho&s;e Di&s;ciples who were di&s;per&s;ed upon the fore-mentioned per&s;ecution, <HI>Barnabas</HI> was &s;ent from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to confirm them. <HI>Barnabas</HI> being at <HI>Antioch,</HI> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ds for <HI>Paul</HI> to come to him thither; where they both &s;tre|nuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ly preach Chri&s;t, and there the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> were fir&s;t called <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tians [Acts</HI> Chap. XI.]. About this time <HI>Herod</HI> per&s;ecu|ted the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="3 letters">tians at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and killed <HI>James</HI> the brother of <HI>John.</HI> (3.) Here are related the <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> un|der-went under <HI>Herod,</HI> who impri&s;oned him with an intent to put him to death; but he was delivered by an Angel upon the prayers of the Church. Whereupon the anger of the King falls heavy upon his Keepers. <HI>Herod</HI> &s;hortly after goes down to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;area;</HI> and in his pride taking to him&s;elf the Ho|nour due to God, he is &s;tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ken by an Angel, and dyeth mi&s;e|rably. After which, the Go&s;pel pro&s;pereth [<HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XII.]. This is the la&s;t we hear of this <HI>great Apo&s;tle</HI> (excepting his be|ing pre&s;ent at the Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Act. 15.) till we come to his Epi&s;tles. As for <HI>Paul,</HI> the remainder of his &s;tory falls within the time and compa&s;s of his travels, and tho&s;e Five re|markable Journeys of his which are de&s;cribed in the Five en|&s;uing Chapters.</P>
<P>The THIRD CHAPTER contains a Narration of <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Fir&s;t Journey</HI> from <HI>Antioch</HI> with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel to the <HI>Gentiles, John-Mark</HI> being their Mini&s;ter: At which time they travelled to <HI>Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycaonia, Pi&s;idia,</HI> and other Provinces of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the Le&s;s. And therefore this Journey we may call for di&s;tinction-&s;ake, <HI>Iter A&s;iaticum;</HI> It is de&s;cribed <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XIII, XIV.</P>
<P>The FOURTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Second Journey</HI> with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and others, from <HI>Antioch</HI> to that fa|mous <HI>Council</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which we may therefore call <HI>Iter Hiero&s;olomitanum.</HI> It is de&s;cribed <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XV. from ver. 1. to 36.</P>
<P>The FIFTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Third Journey,</HI> be|ing accompanied with <HI>Silas</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> to vi&s;it and confirm the
<PB REF="6"> Di&s;ciples in tho&s;e Cities where <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> had before preached the Go&s;pel; which done, they were called by a Vi|&s;ion over into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Europe,</HI> and travel|led to <HI>Philippi, Beroea, The&s;&s;alonica, Athens, Corinth,</HI> and &s;o by <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> returned into <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> and then came back a|gain to <HI>Antioch.</HI> This Journey we may call <HI>Iter Graecum</HI> &s;ive <HI>Macedonicum.</HI> It is de&s;cribed from <HI>ver.</HI> 36 of Chap. XV, to <HI>ver.</HI> 23 of Chap. XVIII.</P>
<P>The SIXTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Fourth Journey,</HI> which he began from <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> from whence he went to <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> according to his promi&s;e, and &s;taying the <HI>greate&s;t part</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> his time in that City, we may from thence call it <HI>Iter Ephe&s;inum.</HI> From thence he went to vi&s;it the <HI>Europaean Chur|ches;</HI> and at la&s;t from <HI>Macedonia,</HI> through <HI>A&s;ia the Le&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> he returned into <HI>Judea,</HI> where by the <HI>Jews</HI> he was ac|cu&s;ed, and by the Roman <HI>Officers</HI> taken into cu&s;tody. Which Journey is de&s;cribed from <HI>ver.</HI> 23 of Chap. XVIII, to Chap. XXVII</P>
<P>The SEVENTH CHAPTER contains <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Fifth</HI> and <HI>La&s;t Journey</HI> from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;area</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> which we may therefore call <HI>Iter Romanum,</HI> It is de&s;cribed <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. XXVII, and XXVIII.</P>
<P>In <HI>the&s;e Seven Chapters</HI> I have compri&s;ed the Divine Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may now ask How it can be properly &s;o called, &s;eeing it chiefly relates the &s;tory of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul;</HI> and of the <HI>former</HI> but &s;paringly, and in&s;i&s;ts principally upon the Acts of the <HI>later,</HI> mentioning but little what the other Apo&s;tles <HI>did,</HI> or what Churches they <HI>planted,</HI> or what <HI>death</HI> they died. For an&s;wer to which, this is all that can be &s;aid, That it &s;eemed good to the Spirit of God to have only <HI>&s;o much</HI> written as he &s;aw conducing to our edification; and in that we are to acquie&s;ce. Be&s;ides, <HI>Luke</HI> who wrote the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> was a di&s;ciple and follower of <HI>Paul,</HI> and his Companion in mo&s;t of his Travels; and therefore no won|der if he de&s;igned principally to write <HI>his Story.</HI> To all which we may add, That as <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> was more miraculous than the conver&s;ion of any other of the Apo&s;tles, &s;o the cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try was more illu&s;trious. <HI>He laboured more abun|dantly than they all,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.10. <HI>Hierom</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Catal. &s;cript. Eccle&s;ia&s;tic. Tom. 1.</NOTE> thinks, <HI>Luke</HI> wrote this Hi&s;tory at <HI>Rome</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> year of <HI>Paul</HI>'s impri&s;onment there, and at the reque&s;t of the Brethren in that City, and by the direction of <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf; but principally, by the peculiar guidance of the Holy Gho&s;t.

For his body remained in the Grave, and his Soul pa&s;&s;ed to Paradi&s;e. And thus the Articles go on methodically without any Tautology. That after Chri&s;ts death his body was buried in the Grave, his Soul went to the place o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> ble&s;&s;ed Souls, and the third day both Soul and bo|dy were re united in his Re&s;urrection, See Dr. <HI>Richard&s;ons</HI> notes on <HI>P&s;alm.</HI> 16.</NOTE> <HI>in Hell,</HI> that is, my dead body in the grave; nor &s;uffer me utterly to peri&s;h in the Pit of corruption &s;o as never to ri&s;e again. <HI>Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of life,</HI> that is, how I &s;hall after my re&s;urrection live for ever in thy glory, <HI>Thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance,</HI> that is, In thy pre&s;ence I &s;hall have fulne&s;s of joy forevermore.

<P><HI>v.</HI> 34. Then &s;tood there up one in the council, a Phari&s;ee, named Gamaliel a doctor of law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the Apo&s;tles forth for a little &s;pace.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 37. After this man ro&s;e up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he al&s;o peri&s;hed, and all, even as many as obeyed him, were di&s;per&s;ed.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. Therefore came I unto you without gain-&s;aying, a&s;&s;oon as I was &s;ent for. I ask therefore for what intent ye have &s;ent for me?</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. And Cornelius &s;aid, Four days ago I was falling until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed in my hou&s;e, and behold a man &s;tood before me in bright clothing,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. And &s;aid, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 32. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who&s;e &s;irname is Pe|ter: he is lodged in the hou&s;e of one Simon a tanner, by the &s;ea-&s;ide, who when he cometh, &s;hall &s;peak unto thee.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 2. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no &s;mall di&s;&s;ention and di&s;|putation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and cer|tain other of them, &s;hould go up to Jeru&s;alem, unto the Apo&s;tles and Elders about this que&s;tion.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 19. Wherefore my &s;entence is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are turned to God.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 20. But that we write unto them, that they ab&s;tain from pollutions of of idols, and from fornication, and from things &s;trangled, and from blood.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 21. For Mo&s;es of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the &s;ynagogues every &s;abbath day.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 22. Then plea&s;ed it the Apo&s;tles, and elders, with the whole church, to &s;end cho&s;en men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas: namely, Judas &s;urnamed Bar&s;abas, and Silas, chief men a|mong the brethren,</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 23. And wrote letters by them after this manner, The Apo&s;tles, and Elders, and brethren, &s;end greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 24. Fora&s;much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us, have troubled you with words, &s;ubverting your &s;ouls, &s;aying, Ye mu&s;t be circumci&s;ed, and keep the law, to whom we gave no &s;uch commandment:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 25. It &s;eemed good unto us, being a&s;&s;embled with one accord, to &s;end cho&s;en men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas, and Paul.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 26. Men that have hazarded their lives for the Name of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 27. We have &s;ent therefore Judas and Silas, who &s;hall al&s;o tell you the &s;ame things by mouth.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 28. For it &s;eemed good to the holy Gho&s;t, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden then the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 29. That ye ob&s;tain from meats offered to Idols, and from blood, and from things &s;trangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep your &s;elves, ye &s;hall do well. Fare ye well.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 30. So when they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 31. Which when they had read, they rejoyced for the con&s;olation.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 32. And Judas and Silas, being prophets al&s;o them&s;elves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 33. And after they had tarried there a &s;pace, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apo&s;tles.</P>

<P><HI>v.</HI> 35. Paul al&s;o and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preach|ing the word of the Lord, with many others al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Gal.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 1. Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jeru&s;alem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 2. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Go&s;pel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, le&s;t by any means I &s;hould run, or had run in vain.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 3. But neither Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumci&s;ed:</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 4. And that becau&s;e of fal&s;e brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to &s;py out our liberty, which we have in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that they might bring us into bondage.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 5. To whom we gave place by &s;ubjection no not for an hour, that the truth of the Go&s;pel might continue with you.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 6. But of the&s;e, who &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat, (what&s;oever they were, it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no mans per&s;on) for they who &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat, in conference added nothing to me.</P>
<P><HI>v.</HI> 7. But contrariwi&s;e, when they &s;aw that the Go&s;pel of the uncircum|ci&s;ion was committed unto me, as the Go&s;pel of the uncircumci&s;ion was unto Peter,</P>

Neither ought this to &s;eem &s;trange, for the in&s;titutions of God (though they may &s;eem weak and fooli&s;h to the World) are more efficacious and powerful then all the wi&s;dom and power of wordly men.

Therefore every man &s;hould duly examine him&s;elf, whether he be a fit gue&s;t for &s;o holy, and heavenly a Table, whether he have a competent <HI>knowledg</HI> of the <HI>nature, &s;ignification, end,</HI> and <HI>u&s;e</HI> of this Fea&s;t, and <HI>di&s;|cern</HI> how it repre&s;ents the Lords Body; whether he truly repent him of his &s;ins, have a lively Faith in Chri&s;t, and be in Charity with his Neighbours; &s;uch therefore as cannot examine them&s;elves, are not to be admitted unto this ordi|nance.

<P N="3"><HI>3ly.</HI> He &s;hews, the excellency of Charity, from the permanency thereof. Cha|rity never fails.

For our knowledg now is but imperfect, in compari&s;on of the knowledg of divine things, which we &s;hall have in the life to come. And &s;o likewi&s;e that gift whereby God enableth us to in&s;truct others, is but imperfect, and &s;hall then cea&s;e, becau&s;e we &s;hall have no further u&s;e of it. But when the perfect knowledg of divine things &s;hall come, then our imperfect gifts which &s;erved to promote knowledg in this life &s;hall cea&s;e. He illu&s;trates this, by a twofold &s;imilitude; <HI>1.</HI> By comparing <HI>this life</HI> to <HI>childhood,</HI> and the <HI>fu|ture</HI> to the <HI>manly &s;tate,</HI> wherein childi&s;h things are aboli&s;hed. <HI>2.</HI> By &s;hewing there is as great a difference betwixt our pre&s;ent knowledg in this life, and that which we &s;hall have hereafter, as between one that &s;eeth the image of anothers face in a Gla&s;s, and one that beholdeth the face it &s;elf. Here we know God in his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> as in a Gla&s;s, by reflection; but there we &s;hall know him <HI>intuitively,</HI> and immediately. And as there is a great difference between propounding a thing darkly and as a riddle, and propounding the &s;ame thing in plain, proper, and expre&s;s words. So here we &s;ee as by a Gla&s;s, or in a Riddle, but then &s;hall we know God face to face, that is, clearly and perfectly. And as for him&s;elf, who was an Apo&s;tle, and had been rapt up into the third Heaven, he acknowledges he knew but in part for the pre&s;ent, but hereafter he a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf, his mind &s;hall be &s;o inlightned by God, that he &s;hall &s;ee him and know him immediately, as God now &s;ees and knows him, though not &s;o perfectly. In Conclu&s;ion, he tells them, that in this life, the&s;e three emi|nent Graces do operate in the hearts of Believers <HI>Faith, Hope,</HI> and <HI>Charity;</HI> Without <HI>Faith</HI> we cannot be ju&s;tified, without <HI>Hope</HI> Faith cannot &s;tand, and by <HI>Love</HI> Faith mu&s;t be operative. But of the&s;e three, the greate&s;t is <HI>Charity. 1.</HI> In re&s;pect of its <HI>extent,</HI> reaching to God, good Angels, our Brethren, our Enemies. <HI>2.</HI> In re&s;pect of its <HI>u&s;e,</HI> extending to the good of <HI>others;</HI> whereas <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> are only private graces. <HI>3.</HI> In re&s;pect of its <HI>duration,</HI> be|cau&s;e <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> &s;hall cea&s;e in the other life; <HI>Faith</HI> &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> in <HI>Fruition,</HI> but <HI>Charity</HI> &s;hall abide for ever. <HI>From Ver. 8. to the end.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;eeing <HI>Charity</HI> is &s;o excellent a grace, he &s;hews, they &s;hould very care|fully <MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="Chap."> labour for it; yet &s;piritual gifts al&s;o they &s;hould earne&s;tly and zealou&s;ly de&s;ire, e&s;pecially that of <HI>interpreting the Holy Scripture,</HI> as the mo&s;t u&s;eful for the edification of the Church.

Wherefore he exhorts them, that of all &s;piritual gifts, they would mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire the gift of <HI>Prophe&s;ie,</HI> for the good of the Church. And in order hereunto, he advi&s;es, that he that hath the gift of an unknown Tongue, &s;hould pray<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">Precetur vel ut ip&s;e vel ut alius interpretetur, quod locutus e&s;t, ut alii di&s;cant.</NOTE> that he may be inabled &s;o to interpret that Tongue, that others may profit thereby.

In &s;um, he &s;hews them, that a vain o&s;tentation of things that tended not to profit, was but a childi&s;h thing. Indeed in innocency they &s;hould imitate little Children, but in <HI>under&s;tanding of things &s;piritual</HI> they &s;hould
<PB N="179" REF="99"> approve them&s;elves to be men. He farther &s;hews, out of the <HI>Law,</HI> that is, the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>(See Joh. 10.34.),</HI> and particularly out of <HI>I&s;a. 28.11.</HI> that becau&s;e the people of <HI>Judah</HI> would not be in&s;tructed by the plain preaching of the Lords Prophets therefore he would cau&s;e them to be &s;po|ken to in an unknown Language for a puni&s;hment of their unthankfulne&s;s and ob|&s;tinacy, that is, he would vi&s;it them with outlandi&s;h Enemies and Armies, who&s;e Language they &s;hould not under&s;tand.

<P><HI>Object. 2. Who can de&s;cribe with what bodies they &s;hall ari&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object. 3. What &s;hall become of tho&s;e that are alive at the Coming of Chri&s;t?</HI> For they are not capable of a Re&s;urrection who never died.</P>
<P>To the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> he an&s;wers, that 'tis as po&s;&s;ible for the Body to ri&s;e again, as for <HI>Corn &s;own</HI> to be quickned after it dies in the earth.</P>
<P>To the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> he &s;ays, that our Bodies &s;hall ari&s;e the <HI>&s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance,</HI> but not <HI>in qualities.</HI> They &s;hall ri&s;e with far more excellent qualities, than tho&s;e they were buried with. As a bare grain of Corn that is &s;own, is rai&s;ed in &s;ub&s;tance and kind the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> but <HI>diver&s;e</HI> in qualities, coming up with <HI>blade,</HI> and <HI>ear,</HI> and <HI>corn</HI> in it: It does not ri&s;e in the &s;ame figure in which it was &s;own. Seeds are &s;own and <HI>rot,</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding they are &s;o far from peri&s;hing there|by, that they ri&s;e up far more beautiful; and whereas they are &s;own <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>hard,</HI> they &s;pring up <HI>green</HI> and <HI>fre&s;h:</HI> So why &s;hould it &s;eem incredible, that our Bodies &s;hould ari&s;e from corruption, and yet with far more excellent qualities than they had before? And as there are &s;everal kinds of <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> and one more excellent than another; and as <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies, are more glorious than <HI>terre&s;trial,</HI> and one cele&s;tial Body differs from another in glory; &s;o it will be in the Re&s;urrection. The Bodies that ri&s;e, will differ from tho&s;e that dyed. That which was here a corruptible Body, when it ri&s;es, will be an incorruptible. The Body that was here obnoxious, and expo&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;es, griefs, and death, will be rai&s;ed glorious and &s;trong, beautiful and &s;hining, like unto the Stars, and the Sun in the Hea|vens <HI>[Math. 13, 43. &amp; 17 2.].</HI> That which was &s;own a <HI>natural</HI> or an <HI>ani|mal</HI> Body, which needed here to be &s;upported, as other animals are, with meat, and drink, and &s;uch things as afforded nouri&s;hment to it, &s;hall be rai&s;ed a <HI>&s;pi|ritual</HI> Body, endued with &s;piritual qualities, not needing meat, or nouri&s;hment, but &s;hall be &s;upported immediately by the Spirit of God without means, as the Angels in Heaven are, <HI>Math. 22.30.</HI> So that there are Bodies of <HI>both the&s;e &s;orts,</HI> which much differ one from the other. And as from the <HI>fir&s;t Adam,</HI> (according to <HI>Gen. 2.7.</HI>) we received a <HI>natural,</HI> or <HI>animal</HI> Body, which yet could not be continued in life without nouri&s;hment; &s;o by the <HI>&s;econd Adam,</HI> name|ly <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we &s;hall obtain a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Body in the Re&s;urrection, which he will &s;u&s;tain without nouri&s;hment by his Spirit, He being a <HI>quickning Spirit</HI> And as &s;ince the Re&s;urrection, Chri&s;t hath a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Body, which is immortal and incorruptible; &s;o &s;hall he al&s;o give <HI>&s;uch Bodies</HI> to tho&s;e that are <HI>his.</HI> Yet all things mu&s;t be done in order; we mu&s;t have a natural Body fir&s;t, and a &s;piritual Body after, as that which is perfect follows upon that which is imperfect. The <HI>fir&s;t Man</HI> is of the earth, <HI>earthly,</HI> and therefore could communicate nothing but a <HI>terrene</HI> life. But the <HI>&s;econd Man,</HI> is not only <HI>man,</HI> but <HI>God</HI> from Heaven al&s;o, and therefore could &s;upport his own Body, that it &s;hould not &s;ee corruption (though in its own nature terrene and re&s;oluble into du&s;t); and having rai&s;ed it out of the grave he could make it glorious, immortal, and heavenly, not need|ing

As he told them before, &s;o he tells them now, (as if he were pre&s;ent with them), that in ca&s;e there be no amendment among them, he will make u&s;e of his Apo&s;tolick power, (which was very great and extraordinary), by which he inflicted not only &s;pi|ritual cen&s;ures, but &s;ometimes al&s;o corporal puni&s;hments, as appears by the in|&s;tance of <HI>Bar Je&s;us,</HI> whom he &s;mote with blindne&s;s, <HI>Act. 13.11.</HI> And they did tempt him thereunto, in that they required a proof from him, whether Chri&s;ts power did concur with his mini&s;try and juri&s;diction, and whether Chri&s;t would ratifie his cen&s;ures, by his judgments following them. He &s;hews, that Chri&s;t had owned him, and manife&s;ted his power in his mini&s;try among them, by converting many of them, and be&s;towing the gifts of his Spirit upon them, and by many &s;igns and miracles, which he enabled him to do in the mid&s;t of them and by his exerci&s;e of &s;piritual di&s;cipline among them. And as Chri&s;t appeared to be a weak and a frail man by being crucified, but was evidenced to be God omnipotent by his ri&s;ing from the dead; &s;o he tells them, if they look upon him, as in him&s;elf, and in re&s;pect of the afflictions he hath been exerci&s;ed with, he may appear a meer <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>ordinary</HI> man, and to be <HI>weak with Chri&s;t,</HI> and therein like and conformable to him; but yet they &s;hould find, that he would &s;hew a re&s;em|blance of Chri&s;ts life and &s;trength <HI>[2 Cor. 10.3.],</HI> and that the power of Chri&s;t liveth in him, and doth manife&s;t it &s;elf in him, again&s;t impenitent and contuma|cious &s;inners. And &s;ince they &s;eek a proof of Chri&s;ts &s;peaking in him, (who fir&s;t preached the Go&s;pel among them); he bids them look to it, and to examine them&s;elves, whether they be in the Faith, (that is, have a true Faith in them), and whether they be in the &s;tate of true Believers, and whether Chri&s;t live in them by his Spirit; which they will find to be &s;o, except for the pre&s;ent they are only meer counterfeit unapproved Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity.

The rea&s;on why this Epi&s;tle &s;tands fir&s;t of all the Apo&s;tolical Epi&s;tles in our Bibles, is not becau&s;e it was fir&s;t written, but becau&s;e of the dignity of the City to which it was addre&s;&s;ed, <HI>viz. Rome,</HI> the Imperial Seat.</NOTE> the Go&s;pel among them at <HI>Rome,</HI> yet he held him&s;elf bound to contribute to the advancement of the Faith of tho&s;e of them, who were effectually called by Chri&s;t, and had obedientially &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Go&s;pel. And accordingly he heartily wi&s;hed the abounding and increa&s;e of all grace, and the &s;weet &s;en&s;e of the favour and love of God to all real Chri&s;tians at <HI>Rome,</HI> whether <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And in the fir&s;t place, that he may te&s;tifie his great affection to them, he declares, how heartily he gives thanks to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, (in who&s;e Name all prayers and thanksgiving ought to be pre&s;ented, <HI>Eph. 5.20. Col. 3.17.</HI>), that their Faith and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Go&s;pel, was &s;o famous, and the report of it &s;pread far and near, and made known in all the Churches of the whole World, and &s;poken of to their great advantage and commendation. In&s;omuch that he &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;es in the pre&s;ence of God, (whom he heartily and &s;incerely &s;erved in the Go&s;pel of his Son), he did not forget them in his daily prayers; but earne&s;tly reque&s;ted of the Lord, that what he had &s;o long de&s;ired and de&s;igned, might happily, (if it &s;eem'd good in his eyes), at la&s;t be accompli&s;hed, namely, that he might come per&s;onally unto them. For he had an extream great de&s;ire to &s;ee them, not for any other rea&s;on, &s;o much as that he might impart unto them &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;pi|ritual gifts which God had endued him with, and might communicate to them a further knowledg of the my&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, that they might be more e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed in the Faith, again&s;t all temptations what&s;oever. Yea he de&s;ired to &s;ee them, that they might be mutually comforted, by a mutual communication of the Faith, that both <HI>he</HI> and <HI>they</HI> had in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For it could not but greatly comfort and &s;trengthen <HI>them,</HI> to hear him di&s;cour&s;e of his Faith in Chri&s;t, and it would al&s;o revive <HI>him</HI> to hear them declare their Faith in the &s;ame Je|&s;us al&s;o; and &s;o they might be mutual comforts each to other. He de&s;ires they &s;hould know that he had often purpo&s;ed to come unto them, but &s;till by one ob&s;ta|cle or other was hindred; and he de&s;ired to come to them, that he might be a means of converting &s;ome there to the Faith, and of confirming others already converted, as among other <HI>Gentiles</HI> he had been a means of converting &s;everal, and gaining them to Chri&s;t. For by the nature of his office, and by the &s;pecial com|mand of Chri&s;t, he was a <HI>debter</HI> to all &s;orts of men, being obliged to preach the Go&s;|pel to them, whether they were <HI>Greeks,</HI> tho&s;e of the mo&s;t <HI>polite</HI> Nations; or <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>ruder.</HI> And as far as concerned him&s;elf, he was mo&s;t ready to take a journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel there al&s;o. For he was far from being a&s;ham'd of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which is a powerful means (in the hand of God) of bringing all tho&s;e to Salvation, that effectually embrace it, whether they be <HI>Jews</HI> (who had the priviledg to have it fir&s;t preached to them) or <HI>Gentiles.

<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> For the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he &s;hews, they were guilty of detaining the truth of God, (that is, the true notions they had of God, and their duty to <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>their Neighbour</HI> by the light of Nature), in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o that they would not walk according to that light, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it, and re&s;i&s;ted it.

For his invi&s;ible and in|comprehen&s;ible Nature, and Almighty Power, are (even ever &s;ince the Creation of the World) clearly to be under&s;tood by his works which are &s;een, <HI>viz.</HI> his works of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> &s;o far as to render tho&s;e, which do not di&s;cern them, nor take notice of them, <HI>inexcu&s;able.</HI> And &s;eeing they glorified not God according to that knowledg, which the light of Nature gave them of him, nor were thankfull for his benefits; they became vain in their imaginations and rea&s;onings concerning God, and his wor&s;hip, and feigned many fabulous and vain Gods unto them&s;elves, whereby their fooli&s;h heart was more and more dark|ned concerning the <HI>true God;</HI> and tho&s;e among them that &s;eemed to be mo&s;t wi&s;e and learned, were in tho&s;e matters as blind and fooli&s;h as others.

He an&s;wers, it was fourteen years, at lea&s;t, before he was circumci&s;ed <HI>[Gen. 15.2.],</HI> therefore this way of being Righteous does not be|long only to the <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> or the <HI>Jews,</HI> but to the <HI>uncircumci&s;ed Gen|tiles</HI> al&s;o, who believing in Chri&s;t become &s;harers with <HI>Abraham</HI> in that ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s.

<P>&V;nder <HI>this head</HI> he al&s;o proves, that they <HI>that are ju&s;tified by Faith</HI> &s;hall certainly be &s;aved from the wrath to come; and this he demon&s;trates, <HI>1.</HI> From the greatne&s;s of Chri&s;ts love to <HI>&s;uch,</HI> before their ju&s;tification, when they lay wel|tring in &s;in and mi&s;ery, unable to help them&s;elves. He &s;hews, that for &s;uch un|godly per&s;ons as the&s;e, Chri&s;t in the fulne&s;s of time came to dye. And what a degree of love this was, he tells them, they may judg by con&s;idering how things u&s;ually are carried among men. Among whom, though for a very <HI>merciful</HI> and <HI>benign</HI> per&s;on, &s;ome one man would perhaps venture his life, yet for <HI>any man el&s;e,</HI> (though he were a righteous and ju&s;t man), they would &s;carcely find any body that would be willing to do it. But God expre&s;&s;es a mercy and kindne&s;s infinitely above this; for He, when he had nothing in the Object to move him to it, when we were profane ungodly &s;inners, yet even then He was plea|&s;ed to &s;end his Son to dye for us. And if the love of Chri&s;t was &s;o &s;trong and efficacious towards us, as to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ve him to dye for us before we believed; &s;urely his <HI>love</HI> will be much more towards us <HI>now,</HI> and his <HI>complacency</HI> greater in us, when we are actually ju&s;tified by Faith in his blood; &s;o that there is no cau&s;e to fear but that we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him. <HI>2.</HI> He &s;hews, that if, when we were enemies, Chri&s;t dyed to work our reconciliation and peace with God (through Faith in his blood); certainly, being now actually ju&s;tified and reconciled to God, by our believing in him, we need not doubt but we &s;hall be &s;aved by him, &s;eeing he now liveth and &s;itteth at the right hand of God, and there intercedes for us, and hath all things &s;ubjected unto him. <HI>3.</HI> See|ing Chri&s;t by his death, &s;ufferings, and interce&s;&s;ion hath procured God to be <HI>our God</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> (which is more than meerly to &s;ave us from wrath), we need not doubt, but that he will do <HI>that</HI> al&s;o for us. <HI>From 6, to 12.</HI></P>
<P>He further pur&s;ues this Argument, by &s;hewing, that the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is not le&s;s effectual to &s;ave tho&s;e that by Faith are united to him, than <HI>Adams</HI> &s;in was to de&s;troy tho&s;e who naturally de&s;cend from him. This he proves by comparing Chri&s;t and <HI>Adam</HI> together, and &s;hewing their <HI>&s;imilitude</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;i|militude; 1.</HI> As by <HI>Adam &s;in</HI> entred into the world, and <HI>death</HI> by &s;in, upon all that are his Children by nature; &s;o by Chri&s;t <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> came into the world, and by righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>life,</HI> unto all that are &s;piritually born of him. For, before the giving of the Law by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;in was in the world, and was imputed, as may appear by this, that Death (which is the wages of &s;in) reigned over In|fants, that had not &s;inned actually as <HI>Adam</HI> had done. Therefore, be&s;ides the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> which Infants could not tran&s;gre&s;s, there was <HI>another Law</HI> which God had given to the <HI>fir&s;t man,</HI> the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion whereof was imputed to
<PB N="235" REF="127"> all his po&s;terity, yea even unto Infants.

For as the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>fountain, head,</HI> or root of &s;in and mi&s;ery, &s;o Chri&s;t is the fountain and head of righteou&s;ne&s;s and life. And having thus &s;hewed, wherein they agreed, he comes now to &s;hew, wherein they differ: And that he mani|fe&s;ts by the&s;e po&s;itions. <HI>1.</HI> The &s;in of <HI>Adam</HI> is not &s;o pernicious, as the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t (which is freely given) is beneficial. For if the offence of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> brought forth <HI>death</HI> to all that are naturally propagated of him, much more &s;hall the free grace of God convey <HI>life</HI> to all tho&s;e who are in Chri&s;t by Faith, and born of him after the Spirit. <HI>2.</HI> Though from <HI>Adams</HI> &s;inning, the guilt of his <HI>one offence</HI> redounds to the condemnation of many, yet the <HI>free gift</HI> of God, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> redounds to the ju&s;tification of many, not only from the guilt of that <HI>fir&s;t &s;in,</HI> but of all other actual &s;ins al&s;o. <HI>3.</HI> As by one offence death reigned over all mankind, much more &s;hall they, who by Faith are united to Chri&s;t, and &s;o participate of his abundant grace, and the free gift of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, be made partakers of everla&s;ting life, wherein they &s;hall reign with Him in glory.

<P>Having &s;hewed how this Doctrine tends to promote holine&s;s, he comes now to exhort tho&s;e who are <HI>ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> to endeavour to be holy, and to take care that <HI>&s;in</HI> get not any dominion over them, and that they obey it not by yeilding to the &s;inful lu&s;ts, inclinations, and motions of the fle&s;h, nor employ the faculties and powers of their &s;ouls, or the members of their bodies in the &s;ervice of &s;in and the Devil, but in the &s;ervice of God, who hath &s;o graciou&s;ly rais'd them by the power of his grace from the death of &s;in, and endowed them with the life of righteou&s;ne&s;s through Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And he tells them, that if they did contend and &s;trive duly again&s;t &s;in, it &s;hould not have dominion over them, becau&s;e they are not under the Law as a <HI>Covenant of works,</HI> exacting perfect obedience, and mini&s;tring no &s;trength to perform it; but under a Covenant of grace in Chri&s;t, which mini&s;ters &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t &s;in, and to overcome it. Yet none ought to infer from hence, that becau&s;e they are not under the Law as a <HI>Covenant,</HI> therefore they are not under it as a <HI>rule;</HI> or that becau&s;e they are under the Covenant of grace, therefore they may indulge them&s;elves in &s;in, &s;eeing the con|trary plainly follows thereupon.

As therefore when they &s;erved &s;in they were void of righteou&s;ne&s;s, (<HI>that</HI> had no whit of their &s;ervice), &s;o now it is but equal, that &s;eeing they are &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s, they &s;hould be free from &s;in, and not &s;ervants at all unto it. La&s;tly, he minds them of the &s;ad na|ture of the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> of &s;in, it being for the time pa&s;t <HI>unprofitable,</HI> for the time pre&s;ent <HI>&s;hameful,</HI> and for the time to come <HI>deadly.</HI> But they that have gain'd liberty from the bondage of &s;in, and are become &s;ervants unto God, he &s;hews, have great benefit thereby.

So that the <HI>wages, due reward,</HI> and <HI>end</HI> of &s;in, is death; but <HI>life eternal</HI> is the <HI>end</HI> of righteou&s;ne&s;s; not as its <HI>wages,</HI> but as a <HI>gift</HI> freely given by God, upon the account of the merit and interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. <HI>From Ver. 12. to the end.</HI></P>

Indeed he found his renewed will &s;omewhat inclining to good, but the corruption yet remaining in him, often hindred the exe|cution of tho&s;e good motions and inclinations, in&s;omuch that he could not but ac|cu&s;e him&s;elf of manifold omi&s;&s;ions of good, and commi&s;&s;ions of evil, which he was heartily &s;orry and di&s;plea&s;ed with him&s;elf for: &s;o that it was not <HI>he as renew|ed,</HI> but as over-power'd by this in-dwelling corruption, that did this evil. And further he declares, that when he was ready to do good, he found the pravity of nature pre&s;ent with him, as a Law over-&s;waying, and forcing, and inclining him to evil; yet, according to his renew'd nature, (called the <HI>inward man</HI> be|cau&s;e hidden, and concealed from the eyes of man), he delighted in the Law of God. <HI>From Ver. 17. to 22.</HI></P>
<P>But he tells them, he had &s;ad experience of another Law, <HI>viz.</HI> the power of &s;in, yet exerting it &s;elf in him, and warring and fighting again&s;t the Law of God, by which his <HI>inward</HI> and <HI>renewed man</HI> was guided, (and with the purity and &s;pirituality whereof it was delighted), and endeavouring to captivate him unto evil. <HI>Ver. 23.</HI></P>
<P>&V;nder a feeling of this mi&s;ery, he cries out, <HI>O that I were delivered from the&s;e carnal lu&s;ts, that are a death to me! O that I were out of this ani|mal and terre&s;trial life!

At la&s;t he concludes, that in this his pre&s;ent regenerate condition; though with his mind, <HI>that is,</HI> with that part that is renewed in him, he &s;erves the Law of God, yet by rea&s;on of the corruption that remains in him, (again&s;t which he did &s;trive),

<P><MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="Chap."> He comes now to &s;hew, that this Doctrine of <HI>ju&s;tification by Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> affords Believers &s;trong ground of <HI>comfort</HI> again&s;t all fear of evil or puni&s;hment, to be endured after this life; which a &s;en&s;e of the imperfection of their &s;anctification, and of &s;in dwelling in them, might &s;trike them with. And under this Head, (from <HI>v. 1.</HI> to <HI>9.</HI>), he &s;hews, <HI>1.</HI> That this <HI>con&s;olation, viz.</HI> &s;ecurity to be freed from Condem|nation, is proper and peculiar to ju&s;tified per&s;ons, only; who being implanted into Chri&s;t by Faith, endeavour to be more and more holy, and fulfill not the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, but follow the guidance of the Spirit of God. For the power of the quick|ning Spirit of Chri&s;t, (which rules in the hearts of <HI>Believers</HI> as a Law, dicta|ting to them what they ought to do), frees <HI>them</HI> and <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in particular, from the reigning power of &s;in, the wages whereof is death: From neither of which the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was able to re&s;cue any man. For the Law cannot ju&s;ti|fie any man now, &s;ince mans tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it, but it only condemns and works wrath; it &s;hews &s;in, it cannot aboli&s;h it. What therefore the <HI>Law</HI> cannot do by rea&s;on of mans fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof, and his pre&s;ent pravity of nature, God was pleas'd to do, by &s;ending his Son (who took on him our true human nature, yet not a &s;inful nature, though he had the likene&s;s of it, in being &s;ubject to our infirmities), to be made a Sacrifice for us on the Cro&s;s, and there he condemn|ed &s;in in the fle&s;h of his Son, and did exact of him the pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hment due to it, that we believing <HI>in him</HI> might be ju&s;tified, and reckoned as tho&s;e, that have performed perfect obedience to the Law; and that, by the inchoation of &s;incere E|vangelical obedience to the Law in us, we might be enabled to walk after the Spirit, and not after the fle&s;h. For tho&s;e that are in their corrupt and natural e&s;tate do &s;avour only fle&s;hly things, which lead and bring a man to death, but they that are regenerate do &s;avour &s;piritual things, which lead to everla&s;ting life and peace. For the wi&s;dom of the fle&s;h, or the carnal mind, is enmity again&s;t God, there being a natural repugnancy in it to &s;ubmit it &s;elf to his will. There|fore they that are in their carnal and corrupt e&s;tate, and follow the lu&s;t and con|cupi&s;cence of the fle&s;h, cannot plea&s;e God till they be converted and changed. <HI>From Ver. 1. to 9.</HI></P>

<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> He u&s;es another Argument, taken from the relation of the <HI>Jews</HI> to the Covenant made with their Fathers, arguing after his manner: The holy Nation; that is, the Nation which is Gods peculiar people, and <HI>federally holy,</HI> cannot be ca&s;t off for ever; but the <HI>Jews</HI> are an holy Nation, which he proveth, becau&s;e they are de&s;cended of <HI>holy Parents;</HI> and if any doubt of that, he proves it by two &s;imilitudes, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t-fruits,</HI> and <HI>root,</HI> which being <HI>holy</HI> make the <HI>lump,</HI> and the <HI>branches</HI> holy. Concerning the <HI>fir&s;t fruits,</HI> the Law is &s;et down <HI>Lev. 23.</HI> by which the people were not permitted to put &s;ickle into their corn till they had offered a <HI>&s;heaf</HI> to the Lord, and then it was lawful for them to reap it; and when they had inn'd their Corn, they might not eat of it, till they had offered <HI>two loaves</HI> to the Lord, and then was their whole <HI>lump</HI> &s;anctified, and made lawfull for them to eat. Now he &s;hews, that the Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were as the <HI>fir&s;t-fruits,</HI> and the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were as the lump. The <HI>Jews</HI> therefore being de&s;cended from tho&s;e holy Patriarchs, to whom and their &s;eed the Covenant is made, <HI>[I will be thy God, and the God of thy &s;eed],</HI> have &s;till a relation to that Covenant made with their Fathers; and &s;o their ca&s;e is not de&s;perate. And the &s;ame is the &s;en&s;e of the other &s;imilitude. As the <HI>branches</HI> follow the nature of the <HI>root,</HI> &s;o do the <HI>Jews</HI> the condition of tho&s;e holy Patriarchs, in regard of the outward priviledges of the Covenant; that is, not in re&s;pect of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>inherent,</HI> but <HI>faederal</HI> and <HI>external</HI> holine&s;s, &s;o as they may expect to be owned by God as his vi&s;ible Church. <HI>From Ver. 11, to 17.</HI></P>
<P>But here &s;ome <HI>Gentile</HI> might object, We acknowledg the <HI>root</HI> of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="136"> Nation to be holy, but what good doth the holine&s;s of the root to the&s;e incredulous branches, that are now broken off, and rejected of God? The Apo&s;tle an&s;wers, That &s;ome of the branches are indeed broken off from the &s;weet <HI>Olive-tree,</HI> (that is, from the Church of the holy Patriarchs); and the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that are as a wild Olive, and not &s;prung from that holy root, are by Faith grafted in among the branches that remain in the &s;weet Olive, and &s;o imitating the Faith of the holy Patriarchs, are made <HI>one Church</HI> with them, and thereby partake of the root and fatne&s;s of the <HI>&s;weet Olive,</HI> that is, of the Doctrine and grace of Chri&s;t, and all the &s;pi|ritual benefits and priviledges which he conferreth on his Church. But yet &s;eeing the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are, of <HI>meer grace,</HI> grafted in, (being before in a forlorn condi|tion), they &s;hould not di&s;dainfully boa&s;t, or in&s;ult over the branches that are broken off, <HI>viz.</HI> the incredulous <HI>Jews;</HI> for they are <HI>natural</HI> branches of that body and root, which bears the believing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and have an outward fellow&s;hip with the Olive; that is, they are the natural Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who <HI>in &s;ome degree</HI> is de&s;pi&s;ed, when his Children are de&s;pi&s;ed; &s;o that if they in&s;ult over the&s;e branches, they do in a manner lift up them&s;elves again&s;t the root, which bore the&s;e branches, even again&s;t <HI>Abraham</HI> him&s;elf, who is call'd the root of this Olive-tree, in re&s;pect, that he is the Parent from which the <HI>Jews</HI> naturally de|&s;cend, and in re&s;pect of the Covenant that God made with him. And further, they &s;hould con&s;ider, that this root doth bear the believing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and not <HI>they</HI> the root.

He an&s;wers, The proper cau&s;e of the breaking off of the <HI>Jews,</HI> was their infidelity, and not the coming in of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> for they came in by accident; and the proper cau&s;e of the coming in, and the pre&s;ent &s;tanding of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> is their <HI>Faith:</HI> Therefore they &s;hould not be high-minded, but fear, and accordingly look to their &s;tanding.

If therefore he hath grafted in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> 'tis much more likely he will re-ingraft the <HI>Jews,</HI> that are the natural branches, (naturally de&s;cended of <HI>Abra|ham</HI> and the holy <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> with whom he made his Covenant), into their own Olive tree, from which they were cut off for their unbelief. <HI>From Ver. 17, to 25.</HI></P>

<P>But &s;ome might here object, What! &s;hall the <HI>Jews</HI> be called and pardoned, that are Gods enemies, whom he hates for rejecting the Go&s;pel?

<P>His la&s;t argument for the <HI>general calling</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> is this; God after a long time of di&s;obedience received the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to mercy; therefore there is rea&s;on to think, that he will at la&s;t receive the <HI>Jews</HI> al&s;o.

<P>THE Apo&s;tle had &s;oon a notable experience of Gods gra|cious protection over him, promi&s;ed unto him in that forementioned Vi&s;ion.

This con&s;pi|racy, by the wonderful providence of God, coming to the knowledg of a <HI>Nephew</HI> of <HI>Pauls,</HI> he is by him acquainted there|with, who thereupon de&s;ired one of the Captains of the Guard, to bring that <HI>young man</HI> to <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> their chief Commander: which being done he acquainted him with this wicked con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t the life of his Uncle.

For they &s;hould con&s;ider, that tho&s;e temptati|ons are <HI>trials</HI> of their Faith; and the trial of their Faith worketh patience, through the operation of the Spirit of God. And they &s;hould learn to be pati|ent to the end, <HI>(Mat. 10.22.),</HI> that &s;o nothing may be wanting to them, for the perfecting and making up all the parts of holine&s;s in them And becau&s;e 'tis a hard matter to bear afflictions aright, and a great deal of heavenly wi&s;dom is requi&s;ite thereunto, he advi&s;es, that when any of them, in &s;uch times of pre&s;|&s;ure as tho&s;e were, do find them&s;elves to want this wi&s;dom and skill to manage them&s;elves aright, that then they &s;hould humbly beg it of God, who giveth libe|rally, and upbraideth not. But then (he tells them) they mu&s;t ask in <HI>Faith,</HI> and with a fixed dependance on God, not wavering, or doubting either concerning his power, goodne&s;s, or faithfulne&s;s. For <HI>doubting</HI> or <HI>wavering</HI> keeps men in a perpetual di&s;quiet, and agitation of mind, not knowing what to depend on. Be&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, this is the way to have their <HI>prayers</HI> bla&s;ted, God not being wont to hear <HI>them,</HI> that do not &s;incerely depend on him. And he further tells them, that 'tis not only in prayer, that this fluctuation, or wavering of &s;pirit, pro|duces &s;uch ill effects; but he &s;hews them, that &s;uch a per&s;on hath the infelicity of never knowing in other occa&s;ions, where to fix or what cour&s;e to take. And having given them this caution concerning <HI>prayer,</HI> he returns to his purpo&s;e a|gain, of comforting the afflicted under their trials. And in order hereunto, he coun&s;els the <HI>poor Chri&s;tian,</HI> who is through afflictions or the Cro&s;s, humbled by the Lord, and brought low, to comfort him&s;elf, yea to glory in <HI>this,</HI> that he is exalted to the high dignity of being an adopted Child of God.

For God is of &s;o <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>ho|ly</HI> a nature that he cannot be tempted or &s;tirred up to &s;in by any means what|ever; neither doth he &s;ollicite or &s;tir up any one to it.

Indeed, if they did di&s;pen&s;e their re&s;pects aright, giving the rich men only, what is ju&s;t, and meet, and did not deprive their poorer Brethren, of what is due to <HI>them,</HI> and in all things carried them&s;elves according to that <HI>Royal Law</HI> of the <HI>King of kings,</HI> con|tained in the Scripture, (which enjoins us <HI>to love our Neighbour as our &s;elves,</HI> and <HI>to do to others what we would judg fit to be done to us</HI>), then they did well; but this partial re&s;pecting of the rich, with contempt of the poor, plainly &s;hewed them to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and not fulfillers of this Law. For the <HI>Law, Lev. 19.15.</HI> (to which place 'tis probable he pointeth), &s;aith, <HI>Thou &s;halt do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in judgment: Thou &s;halt not re&s;pect the per&s;on of the poor, nor the per&s;on of the mighty; but in righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;halt thou judg thy neighbour.</HI> But here they might object <HI>this,</HI> that which he reprov'd in them was a <HI>&s;mall offence,</HI> and might be ea&s;ily excus'd, and their obedience in other things might make amends for &s;uch a &s;mall failing as this was. To this he an&s;wers, that, Suppo&s;e a man &s;hould be an exact ob|&s;erver of all other points of the Law (which yet is impo&s;&s;ible) and willingly offend in one particular, he is guilty of breaking the whole Law. Not that <HI>all &s;ins</HI> concurr in <HI>one,</HI> but becau&s;e a contempt of the &s;ame Law and Law-giver is manife&s;ted in the breach of one Command as well as of all. For obedi|ence to Gods will is required <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> to all that he commands, and he that offends in one command, though he keep all the re&s;t, fails of the obedience which is due from him, and &s;o is puni&s;hable as well as if he had offended in all. And that he may make this matter the more clear, he in&s;tances in the <HI>Sixth</HI> and <HI>Se|venth Commandments,</HI> &s;hewing that in the violation of either, the authority of the <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> and of him that commanded <HI>both,</HI> is violated. But they might again object, that they &s;hall not ultimately be judged by the Law, as gi|ven by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (which requires perfect obedience in every re&s;pect, and pronounces a Cur&s;e upon every one that in the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth), but by the Go&s;pel, <HI>[&s;ee ch. 1.25.].</HI> He an&s;wers, that he would have them &s;o <HI>&s;peak,</HI> and <HI>act,</HI> and carry them&s;elves in tho&s;e matters, as tho&s;e that &s;hall be judged by the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which is a Law of <HI>Liberty</HI> indeed, but not of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> of liberty from &s;in, but not of liberty to &s;in.

Some of them pointed at <HI>Mo|ral</HI> Sanctity, this Chri&s;t in his own per&s;on clearly taught and perfectly fulfill'd; &s;ome pointed at the expiation of &s;in, and this Chri&s;t truly wrought by his <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> obedience; &s;ome pre&s;ignified that eternal Re&s;t which true Believers &s;hall partake of hereafter. 'Tis not imaginable, that tho&s;e <HI>Seducers,</HI> the Apo&s;tle here bends him&s;elf again&s;t, ever pleaded for or &s;trove to maintain the Chri&s;tian-Sabbath, the fir&s;t day of the week. Therefore 'tis not probable, that in oppo&s;ing them, he &s;hould implead that day. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Sab|baths,</HI> here mentioned, were a &s;hadow of things to come, whereas the <HI>Lords day</HI> is a memorial of &s;ome thing pa&s;t, namely, the glorious Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t.

And he hath cau&s;ed the riches of his grace to abound towards them, in not only &s;ending his Son to make atonement for them, but in revealing the Go&s;pel to them, and thereby imparting that true wi&s;dom (the right knowledg of Him&s;elf and his Son unto them) and that &s;piritual prudence which is requi|&s;ite to direct them to order their Chri&s;tian conver&s;ation aright.

The grounds of this &s;ubjection, he &s;hews, mu&s;t be, <HI>1.</HI> The Husband's <HI>head&s;hip</HI> and <HI>&s;uperiority,</HI> by rea&s;on of his <HI>Sex;</HI> in which re&s;pect the Man is call'd the <HI>Image of God</HI> in a &s;en&s;e peculiar to him|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lf which agreeth not to the woman, <HI>1 Cor. 11.7.</HI> And God would have &s;ome re&s;emblance of Chri&s;t's <HI>head&s;hip over the Church,</HI> held forth in the Husband's over the Wife.

And upon this account the Wife ought to practi&s;e this duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e her Husband's power and authority over h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r, is for her good. For his dominion is not to be <HI>tyrannical</HI> or <HI>rigorous,</HI> but <HI>loving, gentle,</HI> and <HI>amiable;</HI> and &s;uch as the Wife may look upon as a <HI>mercy</HI> to her &s;elf, as well as a <HI>dignity</HI> to her Husband.

In the next place he comes to the duty of <HI>Husbands;</HI> exhorting them, Not to abu&s;e that &s;u|periority which God hath given them over their Wives, by a <HI>domineering, har&s;h,</HI> or <HI>bitter</HI> carriage [&s;ee <HI>Col. 3.18.</HI>]; but in&s;tead thereof, to <HI>love</HI> them with a <HI>&s;pecial</HI> and <HI>conjugal love,</HI> &s;uch as no other mu&s;t &s;hare in. This he inforces from Chri&s;t's example, who loved his Church not in <HI>words</HI> only, but in <HI>deeds;</HI> te&s;tifying the greatne&s;s of his love, by giving him&s;elf for it [&s;ee <HI>v. 2.</HI> of this <HI>chap.</HI>], that he might tran&s;late it from a &s;tate of <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> to a &s;tate of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>life;</HI> that he might regenerate and &s;an|ctifie it, that he might clean&s;e it, and do away the <HI>guilt</HI> of &s;in cleaving to believers, <HI>by ju&s;tifying their per&s;ons [Rom. 8.1.];</HI> and the <HI>filth,</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> of &s;in, by the renovation of their natures. And the external means by which be effecteth all this, are, <HI>1. Bapti&s;m,</HI> call'd here, the <HI>wa&s;hing of water.</HI> And, <HI>2. The Mini&s;try of his word.</HI> And his end in thus clean&s;ing and &s;anctifying his Church in this life, is, That it may be holy, not having blemi&s;h, &s;pot, or deformity (that is, exempt from blame and reprehen&s;ion); when it &s;hall be pre&s;ented to him&s;elf, as the Bride to the Bride|groom, for the &s;olemn con&s;ummation of the begun-marriage, <HI>Rev. 19.7.</HI> And according to this example, Husbands ought to love their Wives even as their own bodies, For there is &s;o near a union between them, that he that loves his Wife, loves him&s;elf. 'Tis therefore as unnatural for a man, not to love his Wife, as to hate his own fle&s;h; which all men are &s;o far from doing, that they nouri&s;h and cheri&s;h it, and do all things imaginable for its pre&s;erva|tion. And after the &s;ame manner does Chri&s;t al&s;o nouri&s;h and cheri&s;h his Church, and provide all things nece&s;&s;ary for it, becau&s;e his Church is as nearly join'd to him, as <HI>Eve</HI> was to <HI>Adam,</HI> of whom (being made of a rib taken out of his &s;ide with fle&s;h on it) he &s;aid, <HI>Gen. 2.23.

But Chri&s;t did not always &s;tand mini&s;tring and offering &s;acrifices, as they did; but having once offered up him&s;elf on the Cro&s;s (which one Sacrifice &s;ufficeth for &s;in for ever), he cea&s;ed and offered no more, but a&s;cended into heaven, and there &s;itteth at the right hand of his Father, and there continueth to execute his <HI>Kingly</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;tly Office,</HI> till all the enemies of our &s;alvation, and at la&s;t Death it &s;elf, &s;hall be vanqui&s;hed; and then He &s;hall lay down this form of governing, and with the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t be <HI>all in all</HI> for ever; &s;ee <HI>1 Cor. 15.24,</HI> &amp;c. And he &s;hews, it needs not be wondred at, that Chri&s;t hath now no more offerings to make, nor &s;ufferings to endure; for by that <HI>one offering</HI> of him&s;elf, he hath made a perfect &s;atisfaction to the Ju&s;tice of God, and a full purcha&s;e of all things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Heb. 7.25.</NOTE> that were requi&s;ite and needful, to bring tho&s;e to eternal life who are <HI>&s;anctified</HI> by his grace, and brought to believe in him with a lively faith. He hath not left any other Offering to be made for them, after His. And he further proves the ab&s;olate perfection of Chri&s;t's Sacrifice, by the te&s;timony of the Holy Gho&s;t, recorded <HI>Jer. 31.31.</HI> where af|ter God bad promi&s;ed a <HI>new Covenant</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>old,</HI> and had &s;aid, <HI>This is the Covenant I will make with them after tho&s;e days (viz.</HI> when the days of the Old Te&s;tament are ex&s;pir'd); then He &s;ays, <HI>I will put my Law into their hearts, and their &s;ins and iniquities I will re|member no more.</HI> Now &s;eeing God promi&s;eth under the <HI>new</HI> Covenant, <HI>&s;anctification</HI> and <HI>remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins</HI> to all true believers (of which Cove|nant Chri&s;t is the Mediator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Chap. 8.6.

<P>Another argument whereby he pre&s;&s;es the &s;tudy of holine&s;s, is, becau&s;e <HI>the end of all things was at hand;</HI> that is, the end of the <HI>Jewi&s;h State</HI> and <HI>Polity.</HI> For that great fatal de&s;truction threatned to the obdurate <HI>Jews,</HI> and often mentioned by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, drew nigh; &s;ee <HI>Mat. 24. Jam. 5.3, 9.</HI> Therefore he exhorts them, <HI>1.</HI> To be &s;ober, and moderate, and to be much in prayer with God; and to add to their prayers watchfulne&s;s, that <HI>that day</HI> do not &s;urprize them unawares. <HI>2.</HI> He pre&s;&s;eth them to exerci&s;e a <HI>fer|vent love</HI> and charity one towards another, as the <HI>&s;um</HI> and chief of all the duties we owe to our Neighbour: For <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>Charity,</HI> he tells them, will cover a multitude of &s;ins and failings among Chri&s;tians <HI>[Prov. 10.12.],</HI> and will hide them from the knowledg of the prophane. <HI>3.</HI> They &s;hould be cheer|fully ho&s;pitable to their poor brethren, without grudging or murmuring at the charge. <HI>4.</HI> They &s;hould endeavour rightly to employ their &s;piritual gifts for the good of others, which they had received according to their re&s;pective places in the Church, as counting them&s;elves &s;tewards of tho&s;e various gifts be&s;towed on them through the free grace and favour of God. He in&s;tances in two, <HI>1. Preaching of the word;</HI> &s;hewing, that he that teacheth and in&s;tructeth the people, ought to do it with that uprightne&s;s and reverence, as becomes one that is a &s;teward or di&s;pen&s;er of the Oracles of God. <HI>2. Mini&s;tration to the poor;</HI> which office the Deacons were faithfully to di&s;charge; and private Chri&s;tians were al&s;o to exerci&s;e their liberality according to the ability God had given them; that in the right u&s;e of all the&s;e gifts, God might receive glory (both by the <HI>Steward</HI> and <HI>di&s;pen&s;er</HI> of them, and by tho&s;e al&s;o who are <HI>profited</HI> by them) through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in who&s;e <HI>&s;trength</HI> only the&s;e gifts are rightly employed <HI>[Joh. 15.5.],</HI> and through who&s;e merits and me|diation, the <HI>intention</HI> to glorifie God by them is accepted <HI>[Heb. 13.5.];</HI> to whom, as to God ble&s;&s;ed for ever, all honour and dominion ought for ever to be a&s;cribed. <HI>From Ver. 7, to 12.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, he exhorts them not to be troubled or amazed at the &s;harpe&s;t per&s;ecutions or hotte&s;t trials they &s;hould meet with for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. For con&s;idering that in <HI>that furnace</HI> their graces will be tried, and their corrup|tions purged away, they &s;hould count it matter of joy to them, becau&s;e hereby they are made partakers of the afflictions appointed for the members of Chri&s;t, and are made like unto him in &s;uffering, and &s;hall &s;hare with him in his glory, and have matter of incomparable exultation and joy at his &s;econd com|ing. In the mean time, if they be reproached for the Name of Chri&s;t, and for their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, they &s;hould e&s;teem it the happie&s;t thing that could befall them. For the glorious <HI>Spirit</HI> of God delighteth with his comfortable and &s;upporting-operations, to re&s;ide in the hearts of &s;uch as &s;uffer for righ|teou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake; which ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, though he be bla&s;phemed by per&s;ecutors, yet he is glorified by tho&s;e who boldly confe&s;s the truth, which he teacheth and imparts unto them. But he advi&s;es them by all means to be careful, that not any of them &s;uffer as an <HI>evil-doer</HI> in any kind; but if he &s;uffer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, or becau&s;e he is a Chri&s;tian, he &s;hews that he ought to rejoyce in it, and to glorifie God, who hath made him <HI>willing,</HI> and hath enabled him to &s;uffer in &s;o good a cau&s;e, and hath thereby honoured him with a certain degree of Martyrdom. He tells them, the time is at hand when the Chri&s;tians mu&s;t expect great &s;ufferings. <HI>Judgment</HI> will begin at the Hou&s;e and Family of God, for the correction and trial of his own children. And if God thus begin with his own children, who embrace the Go&s;pel of his

<P>AND now we can trace this great Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> no further by any light the Scripture hath left us. Some learned men indeed hold, that (the <HI>two years</HI> being ended in which he was detained in Military cu&s;tody, and taught the Doctrine of Chri&s;t at <HI>Rome</HI>) he preached the Go&s;pel up and down in <HI>Italy;</HI> and from thence went into <HI>Spain</HI> and the We&s;tern parts.

Po&s;&s;ibly the <HI>apostacy</HI> and <HI>wa|vering</HI> he heard of in the <HI>Ea&s;tern Churches,</HI> cau&s;ed him to think it more needful to go thither, than to go <HI>We&s;tward.</HI> He expe|cted indeed <HI>Timothy</HI> to come to him again to <HI>Rome;</HI> but whe|ther they ever met and travelled together again, or what fur|ther became of either of them, we cannot from any thing the Scripture hath left us, certainly determine.</P>

<P>The <HI>Prodigies</HI> related by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> were the&s;e: Not long be|fore the Warr, on the day of <HI>&V;nleavened bread,</HI> about nine of the clock at night, between the <HI>Altar</HI> and the <HI>Temple</HI> there &s;hined &s;uch a <HI>light,</HI> that it might have been thought to be <HI>mid-day,</HI> which continued half an hour. In the &s;ame <HI>Feast</HI> al&s;o a <HI>Cow</HI> that was led to &s;acrifice, brought forth a <HI>Lamb</HI> in the middle of the Court of the Temple. The Ea&s;t gate of the Temple, which was Bra&s;s, and mighty heavy, and could &s;carce be &s;hut with twenty men, and at evening was lock'd up, and barr'd with barrs of Iron, was &s;een (about &s;ix of the clock at night) to open of its own accord.

<P>The <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of the Warr that brought that fatal ruin and de&s;truction upon the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State,
<PB N="454" REF="235"> was this: <HI>Florus</HI> being &s;ent by <HI>Nero</HI> to &s;ucceed <HI>Albinus</HI> in the <HI>Procurator&s;hip of Judea,</HI> being a vile and wicked per&s;on, outra|giou&s;ly abu&s;ed his Authority, and by all manner of Rapines and In&s;olencies vex'd and oppre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Jews;</HI> in&s;omuch, that by a <HI>publick Cryer</HI> he gave leave to <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>High way-men</HI> to rob and &s;poil throughout the whole Countrey, provided he him&s;elf might have part and &s;hare of the booty. The <HI>Jews</HI> not able to endure the&s;e Outrages, &s;ome of them abandoned their hou&s;es, and fled to &s;trange Countreys. Others of them (being of them&s;elves forward enough to revolt) were yet greatly provoked thereunto by the daily oppre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Flo|rus,</HI> who endeavoured to drive them to it, that his great and intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ions and Villanies might be le&s;&s;ened by their Revolt. Another thing al&s;o that much di&s;pos'd them thereunto, was this: There was a Pro|phecy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Suetonius</HI> Ve&s;p. c. 4.

But the <HI>Jews</HI> applying it to them|&s;elves, revolted; and &s;o Chri&s;t's blood lying upon them, and crying for vengeance, they them&s;elves ha&s;tened that vengeance by their own Madne&s;s. The Warr began in the <HI>Twelfth year of Nero,</HI> in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> who was then in <HI>Grecia,</HI> and &s;tayed there till Winter.</P>
<P>King <HI>Agrippa</HI> (who had under his government <HI>Galilee, Tibe|rias, Tarichea, Julias</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> with the neighbouring-Villages, and <HI>Chaleis</HI>), in a long Oration dehorts the <HI>Jews</HI> from warr, but in vain. For a little while after he was gone from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Seditious</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, on a &s;udden, of the &s;trong Ca&s;tle <HI>Ma&s;&s;ada,</HI> and put to the &s;word all the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> they found there. At <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> al&s;o, <HI>Eleazer</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Ananias</HI> the High-Prie&s;t, and Commander of the Soldiers of the Temple (a bold and factious young man) per&s;waded the Prie&s;ts that they &s;hould not offer any more the Sacrifices that were wont to be offered for <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and the welfare of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Which ra&s;h act, the Governours of the City (that were peaceable men) plainly &s;aw tended to open rebellion. Whereupon, not being able to per&s;wade the <HI>Seditious</HI> from this cour&s;e, they &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Florus</HI> at <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> and to King <HI>Agrippa;</HI> de&s;iring them; that they would pre&s;ently &s;end Forces and &s;uppre&s;s the Rebellion in the beginning. <HI>Florus,</HI> who de|&s;ired there &s;hould be a Revolt, neglected it.

Between the&s;e two parties there were continual skirmi&s;hes for &s;even days together.

<P><HI>Titus</HI> having thus ended the Warr, returns to <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Antiochia</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and then into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thence &s;ails to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was welcomed home by all men, and (together with his Father) triumphed for the Conque&s;t of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>The two Captains of the <HI>Seditious, John</HI> and <HI>Simon,</HI> who had hid them&s;elves, were taken, and re&s;erved to be led in triumph, and 700 other Jews that excelled in beauty and &s;trength; of all whom only <HI>Simon</HI> &s;uffered death. The <HI>LAW</HI> al&s;o of the
<PB N="463" REF="239"> Jews was carried in this Triumph as the <HI>la&s;t of the &s;poils,</HI> which together with the <HI>Purple Veils</HI> of the Sanctuary, were laid up in the Palace.</P>
<P>From this Victory both <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> got the Name of <HI>Em|peror;</HI> yet neither of them had the Title of <HI>Judaicus,</HI> although many other Honours, e&s;pecially <HI>Triumphal Arches,</HI> were decreed unto them.</P>
<P>A year after, <HI>Lucilius Ba&s;&s;us</HI> was &s;ent Lieutenant into <HI>Judea,</HI> who receiving the Army from <HI>Cerealis Vitellianus,</HI> took the Ca|&s;tle <HI>Herodian</HI> and <HI>Macharua</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> wrote to <HI>Tiberius Maximus</HI> to <HI>&s;ell all the Land of the Jews;</HI> upon whom, where&s;oever they lived, he impo&s;ed a yearly Tribute to be paid into the <HI>Capitol,</HI> viz. the <HI>Didrachma</HI> or half Shekel, it being that they were wont to pay in former times unto the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>A year after, <HI>Publius</HI> &s;ucceeds <HI>Ba&s;&s;us,</HI> and fini&s;hes the Warr, taking the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ma&s;&s;ada</HI> from <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Judas Galilaeus</HI> the Captain of the Thieves. All the Thieves in the Ca&s;tle (to the number of 900, with their Wives and Children) at the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Eleazar,</HI> &s;et fire on the Ca&s;tle, and the Fur|niture thereof, and then put each other to death, le&s;t they &s;hould fall into the power of the <HI>Romans.</HI> And &s;o the Warr in <HI>Judea</HI> ended.</P>
<P>Many of the Thieves that e&s;caped from <HI>Judea,</HI> fled into <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and there they &s;ollicited the Jews to revolt; but the common people taking 600 of them, delivered them up to the <HI>Romans</HI> to be puni&s;hed. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> having notice of the&s;e things, commands <HI>Lupus</HI> the Governour of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> that he &s;hould pull down the <HI>Jewi&s;h Temple</HI> that was there built long ago by <HI>Onias</HI> the Brother of the High-Prie&s;t; which he neglect|ed to do, but only &s;poiled it of &s;ome of its Con&s;ecrated things, and &s;o &s;hut it up. But <HI>Paulinus,</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, having &s;poiled it of all its gifts, made an Order that none &s;hould pre&s;ume to come to it; and &s;o he put an end to the exerci&s;e of the Jewi&s;h Religion there, 343 years (as &s;ome compute) after that Temple was fir&s;t built by <HI>Onias.</HI></P>
<P>A certain Jew, a Weaver, <HI>Jonathan</HI> by name, e&s;caping to <HI>Cy|rene,</HI> drew 2000 Jews to follow him into the Wilderne&s;s, pro|mi&s;ing to &s;hew them <HI>&s;igns</HI> and <HI>wonders;</HI> but by the chiefe&s;t of the Jews the matter being di&s;covered to <HI>Catullus,</HI> Governour of tho&s;e parts, he &s;ent Soldiers, who &s;lew mo&s;t of them; and not long after, <HI>Jonathan</HI> him&s;elf was taken, who accu&s;ed the mo&s;t wealthy of the Jews (unju&s;tly) to have had a hand in this In&s;urrection. To who&s;e accu&s;ations <HI>Catullus</HI> willingly giving ear, put 3000 of them to the &s;word. And this he did with the greater confidence, be|cau&s;e he confi&s;cated their E&s;tates to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s u&s;e. <HI>Jonathan</HI> he &s;ent pri&s;oner (with others that were taken) to <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> that he might accu&s;e the mo&s;t hone&s;t of tho&s;e Jews that lived at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> as if they had held corre&s;pondence with him; yea, he af|firmed, That <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the Writer of the Jewi&s;h Hi&s;tory, &s;ent to him
<PB N="464" REF="240"> both Arms and Money. But <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> looking upon this as a fal&s;e accu&s;ation, upon <HI>Titus</HI>'s entreaty acquitted the&s;e men, and de&s;er|vedly puni&s;hed <HI>Jonathan,</HI> whom having whipped, he burnt alive. <HI>Catullus</HI> at pre&s;ent e&s;caped through the mildne&s;s of the Emperor; but not long after, fell into grievous angui&s;h of mind, and imagi|ned he &s;aw the Gho&s;ts of tho&s;e men he had &s;o unju&s;tly &s;lain before his eyes. At la&s;t his <HI>guts</HI> and <HI>bowels</HI> i&s;&s;uing out of him, he died mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> endeth his Hi&s;tory of the De&s;truction of <HI>Judea.</HI> But his <HI>Jewi&s;h Antiquities</HI> he fini&s;hed not till the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> of <HI>Domitian,</HI> when he was Fifty &s;ix years old, as him&s;elf te&s;tifieth at the end of his Work.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude all with an hearty Prayer to God for the <HI>Conver&s;ion of the Jews,</HI> and the <HI>&V;nion of all Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>O</HI> LORD, the Father of Mercies, let not thy indignation al|ways burn again&s;t thy <HI>ancient people,</HI> nor ca&s;t them off for ever. Though the blood of thy dear Son, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, lies heavy upon them, and hitherto thou ha&s;t justly hardned them; yet be plea&s;ed, of thy infinite mercy, to open their eyes, to un&s;top their ears, to mollifie their hearts, and to cau&s;e them to <HI>mourn over him whom their fore|fathers pierced.</HI> Cau&s;e them to under&s;tand tho&s;e <HI>Sacred Oracles</HI> which thou did&s;t commit to their keeping; that our <HI>Saviour,</HI> who hath long &s;ince been <HI>a light to lighten the Gentiles, may,</HI> in thy due time, <HI>be the glory of thy people I&s;rael;</HI> that &s;o there may be but <HI>one Sheepfold,</HI> as there is but <HI>one Shepherd.</HI> For the &s;peeding of their conver&s;ion, be plea&s;ed to compo&s;e the many <HI>differences</HI> that are among <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and &s;o unite their di&s;agreeing-affections, that our examples may no longer di&s;courage, but may invite them to em|brace our Lord and Saviour, and his ble&s;&s;ed Doctrine. Cau&s;e thy <HI>Truth,</HI> O Lord, to &s;hine forth gloriou&s;ly and triumphantly, as the Sun at noon|day; and let it di&s;pel the thick mi&s;t of darkne&s;s and error that hath over&s;pread &s;o many Nations of the world; &s;et up thy <HI>pure Wor&s;hip,</HI> and thy <HI>own In&s;titutions</HI> every where; and throw down <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e wor&s;hip</HI> where-ever it prevails. Break the yokes of <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>violence,</HI> and rebuke the &s;pirit of <HI>profane&s;s, impiety, intem|perance, ungodline&s;s;</HI> and let <HI>holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, brotherly-kindne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> prevail where-ever the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is owned and profe&s;&s;ed. &V;nite all Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e things that are the main <HI>fundamental</HI> Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and give them <HI>charity</HI> and <HI>mutual forbearance</HI> of each other in le&s;s important matters. Let all that name the Name of Chri&s;t, make con&s;cience to depart from all iniquity, and live as becomes his di&s;ciples and &s;er|vants. Grant this, O Lord, for thy own great Mercies, and our dear Saviour's Merits &s;ake; To Whom, with thy Self, and Holy Spirit, be all Honour, Glory, Prai&s;e, Thanksgiving, and Sincere Obedience, ren|dred now and for evermore. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q>
<CLOSER>Glory be to God in the Highe&s;t, on earth peace, good-will towards men.</CLOSER>
