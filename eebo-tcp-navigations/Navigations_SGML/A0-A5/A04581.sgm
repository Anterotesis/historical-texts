<HEAD>NOVA BRITANNIA. Offering most excellent fruites by Planting in <HI>VIR|GINIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WHereas in our last m&eacute;e|ting and conference the o|ther day, obseruing your sufficient reasons answe|ring all obiections, and your co~stant resolution to go on in our Plantation, they gaue me so good con|tent and satisfaction, that I am driuen against my selfe, to confesse mine own error in standing out so long, whereby many of you (my frends) were engaged in the businesse before m&eacute;e, at whose often instigations I was but little moued, and lightly est&eacute;emed of it till being in place, where obseruing the wise and prudent sp&eacute;ech, of a worthy Gentleman, (well knowne to you all) a most painful mannager of such publike affayres within this Cittie, which moued so effectually, tou|ching the publike vtilitie of this noble enterprize, that with|holding no longer, I y&eacute;elded my money aad endeuours as others did to aduance the same, and now vpon more aduised consideration, I must n&eacute;edes say I neuer accompted my
<PB REF="4">
poore meanes employed to better purpose, then (by Gods helpe) the successe of this may bee, and therefore I cannot but deliuer (if you please to heare) what I rudely conceiue of a suddaine.</P>
<P>There are diuers monuments already publisht in Print to the world&punc; manifesting and shewing, that the Coasts and parts of <HI>Virginia</HI> haue beene long since discouered, peopled and possessed by many English, both men, women, and chil|dren, the naturall subiects of our late Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of famous memorie, conducted and left there at sundrie times, And that the same footing and possession is there kept and possessed by the same English&punc; or by their seede and of-spring, without any interruption or inuasion, either of the Sauages (the natiues of the countrie) or of any other Prince or people (for ought wee <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">eare or know) to this day, which argueth sufficiently to vs (and it is true) that ouer those English and Indian people, no Christian King or Prince (other then <HI>Iames</HI> our Soueraigne Lord and King) ought to haue rule or Dominion, or can by possession, conquest, or inheritance, truely claime or make iust title to those Territories, or to any part thereof, except it bee (as wee heare of late) that a challenge is laid to all, by vertue of a Donation from <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the sixt, Pope of Rome, wherein (they say) is giuen all the West Indies, including <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> with all America, and whatsoeuer Ilands adiacent.</P>
<P>But what is this to vs? they are blind indeede that stum|ble here, it is much like that great donation of <HI>Constantine</HI> whereby the Pope himselfe doeth hold and claime the Citie of Rome, and all the Westerne Empire, a thing that so cros|seth all Histories of truth, and sound Antiquitie, that by the apt resemblance of those two Donations, the whole West Empire, from a temporall Prince to the Pope, and the whole West Indies, from the Pope to a temporall Prince&punc; I doe verily gesse they be neere of kinne, they are so like each other, the one an olde tale vaine and fabulous, the other a new toy most idle and ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">When the flatterers of <HI>Cambises</HI> King of Persia, could find no law to warrant his immoderate lust and incestuous mariage with his owne daughter, yet they told him of ano|ther law which they had found, wherby the Kings of Persia might doe what they listed: if in these cases likewise there bee a law that the Pope may doe what he list, let them that list obey him, for we beleeue not in him.</P>
<P>Letting goe (therefore) these legendarie fables, which howsoeuer some men holde authenticke as their Creede, yet are they in the iudgement of wise men, things of no value, nor doe import to vs, any cause of doubt or feare, but that wee goe on in our honest enterprise, and lawfull purpose now in hand, that (as wee hope) his Maiestie mindeth not the reliquishing his estate and enterest, deriued to him by right of succession, from his immediate predecessor, but for the further planting and succouring our old Colony, hath giuen vs leaue to make new supplies, which wee lately sent thither vnder the conduct of <HI>Christopher Newport</HI> Cap|taine: And hath granted many gratious priuiledges, vnder the great Seale, to vs and to our Heirs for euer, that will aduenture or plant in the said plantation: So I wish and in|treat all well affected subiects, some in their persons, others in their purses, cheerefully to aduenture, and ioyntly take in hand this high and acceptable worke, tending to aduance and spread the Kingdome of God, and the knowledge of the truth, among so many millions of men and women, Sauage and blind, that neuer yet saw the true light shine before their eyes, to enlighten their minds and comfort their soules, as also for the honour of our King, and enlarging of his king|dome, and for preseruation and defence of that small num|ber our friends and countrimen already planted, least for want of more supplies we become a scorne to the world&punc; sub|iecting our former aduentures to apparant spoile and hazard, and our people (as a prey) to be sackt and puld out of possessi|on, as were the French out of <HI>Noua Francia,</HI> not ma|ny yers ago&punc; and which is the lest and last respect&punc; (yet vsual|lie
<PB REF="5">
preferred) for the singular good and benefite that wil vn|doubtedly arise to this whole Nation, and to euerie one of vs in particular, that will aduenture therein, as by true relation (God willing) I shal make it manifestly appeare to all.</P>
<P>It is knowne to the world, and cannot bee forgotten, that the dayes and raigne of Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> brought forth the highest degree of wealth, happinesse, and honour, that euer England had before her time, whereof to let passe the particular praises, as impertinent to my purpose, I doe onely call to minde our Royall Fleetes and Marchants Shippes, (the Iewels of our land) our excellent Nauiga|tors, and admirable voyages, as into all parts and round a|bout the Globe with good successe, to the high fame and glo|rie of our Nation, so especially their aime and course was most directed to the new found world, to the maine land and infinite Ilands of the West Indies, intending to discouer with what conuenience to Plant and settle English Colo|nies, in places not already possessed and inhabited by subiects of other Christian Princes, wherein after many tedious and perilous aduentures, howsoeuer strange seas and miserable famine, had deuoured and distressed shipps and men of inesti|mable value, yet were not the remnant escaping, swallowed vp of despaire, nor their hart and spirits daunted with feare, but daily armed afresh with inuincible courage, and greater resolution (scorning to sit downe by their losses) made newe attempts, not induring to looke on whilst so huge and spa|cious countries (the fourth part of the world) and the greatest and wealthiest part of all the rest, should remaine a wilder|nes, subiect (for the most part) but to wilde beasts and fowles of the ayre, and to sauage people, which haue no Christian, nor ciuill vse of any thing, and that the subiects onely of one Prince <HI>Christian,</HI> which but within the memorie of man be|gan first to creepe vpon the face of those Territories, &amp; now by meanes of their remnants settled here &amp; there, do therfore imagine the world to be theirs, shouldring out al other nati|ons,
<PB REF="5">
accounting themselues Kings and Commanders, not onely in townes and places where they haue planted, but o|uer all other partes of <HI>America,</HI> which containe sundrie vast and barbarous Regions, many of which (to this day) they neuer knew, nor did euer setle soote therein: which notwith|standing, if it were yeelded them as due, yet their strength and meanes farre inferiour to their aspires, will neuer stretch to compasse or replenish the hundreth part thereof: and this we proued true not many yeares agoe, our Prince and theirs being then at open hostilitie, their best and chiefest residen|ces were scattered with so poore and slender troups, that with handfuls of men (at sundry times) we ran thorow all, surpri|zing and sacking their strongest forts and townes in those parts, and might long since with ease, following and second|ing our forces, haue set them to their stint.</P>
<P>But seeing we so passed by their dwellings, that in seating~ our selues, wee sought not to vnsetle them, but by Gods mercy, after many stormes&punc; were brought to the Coast of another countrie, farre distant and remote from their habita|tions: why should any frowne or enuie at it, or if they doe, why should wee (neglecting so faire an opportunitie) faint or feare to enlarge our selues, where is our force and aunci|ent vigour? Doth our late reputation sleepe in the dust? No, no, let not the world deceiue it selfe, we still remaine the same, and vpon iust occasion giuen, we shall quickly shew it too: ha|uing now by Gods blessing, more meanes then euer heereto|fore, beeing strongly senced where wee wonted to lie o|pen: Our plant, we trust, is firmely root<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">d, our armes and limmes are strong, our branches faire, and much desire to spread themselues abroad.</P>
<P>But before I come to discribe this earthly Paradice, or to proue the points of my proposition mentioned before, you shall knowe, that the first discouery and actuall possession ta|ken thereof, was in the raigne, and by the subiects of <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth of England, at which time did <HI>Spaine</HI> also dis|couer, and by that right of discouery, doeth retaine and holde
<PB REF="6">
their <HI>Noua Hispania,</HI> and all other their limmits vpon that Coast: But that we now intend to ground vpon is a more late Discouerie and actuall possession, taken in the name and right of <HI>Queene Elizabeth,</HI> in <HI>Anno</HI> 1584. the 13&punc; of Iuly, as it is truely set downe in the Booke of English Uoyages, by sundry English Captaines and Gentlemen in that Uoy|age, whose names are recorded in that Discourse (and many of which are yet liuing) whereof when her Maiestie had true information, sh&eacute;e named the Countrey <HI>Virginia,</HI> and did assigne to <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> (then a Gentleman of worth) power and Authoritie to Plant forces and Colonies there, at his pleasure, who transported thither in <HI>Anno</HI> 1587. by the conduct of <HI>Iohn White</HI> chiefe Leader, aboue an hundred men, Women, and Children at one time, and left them there to Inhabite to this day: Notwithstanding, it is true ind&eacute;ede (as some may obiect.) It is now aboue twentie y&eacute;eres agoe since these things were done, and yet euer since in al this time, we neuer sawe or heard of any good that hath come from thence, nor of any hope, that might encourage vs anew to engage our selues therein.</P>
<P>But let vs rightly weigh the reasons of it, and then iudge: Those hundred and vpwards, conducted thither by <HI>Iohn White,</HI> and whose particular Names you may s&eacute;e Recorded in the same Booke of Uoyages, were left there, with intent and promise, to be supplied from England, with more compa|nies and all necessaries, the next y&eacute;ere following: in the meane time, they were to Plant and fortifie themselues in be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t maner they could, and to make a Discouerie of such Mi|nerals, and other Merchandize, as the Countrey should y&eacute;eld by nature. But as all good Actions haue their Crosses and their Bane attending on them, so had this: for that those which had the Managing of a new Supply, being the next y&eacute;ere sufficiently furnished to Sea for that ende, yet most vnnaturally, being Tainted with that common corrupti|on of time, turned their head another way, and with gree|die minds, betooke themselues wholly to hunt after Pillage
<PB REF="6">
vpon the Spanish Coast, where spending their men, their time, and prouisions, they were not able (b&eacute;eing come and a|riued at the port) to make vp into the land to visit and relieue their friends, but were forced to retire for England againe, whereby the edge of those Aduenturers that set them foorth was so abated, that this most honourable enterprise so hap|pily begunne, was by this occasion most vnhappily ended, neither had our poore countri-men left there, any meanes from thence to visite vs, nor in all this time to giue vs any light of their owne estate: whereas then, if those beginnings had b&eacute;ene followed as they ought, and as by Gods helpe w&eacute;e now entend, that country had long since become a most roy|all addition to the Crowne of England, and a very nurse|ry and fountaine of much wealth and strength to this King|dome.</P>
<P>When <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> (the first bewrayer of this new world) was to make his proffer where he liked best, hee chose <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth of England, as in those dayes the most worthy, and best furnished for Nauigations, of all the Kings in Christendome: offering to inuest his Maiestie with the most pretious and richest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">aines of the whole earth, neuer knowne before, as he did also the like to the Kings of Portugale and Spaine, who (as the story saith) for his poore apparell and simple lookes, and for the noueltie of his proposition, was of most men accounted a vaine foole, and vtterly reiected: saue that the Spanish better conceiuing then some others, beganne to entertaine and make vse of his skill, which within these hundred yeares, hath brought foorth those apparant fruits to the world as cannot be hidde. Their Territories enlarged, their Nauigations encreased, their subiects enriched, and their superfluitie of coyne ouer-sprea|ding al parts of the world, procures their Crowne to flourish, and highly commendeth the wisedome of Spaine: whose quicke apprehension and sp&eacute;edy addresse, preuented all other Princes: albeit (as you know) their greatnes of minde ari+sing together with their money and meanes, hath <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB REF="7">
all Christendome these fourtie yeares and more.</P>
<P>And this I but mention, to note the blind diffidence of our English natures, which laugh to scorne the name of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and all other new proiects, bee they neuer so pro|bable, and will not beleeue till wee s&eacute;e the effects: as also to shew how capable men ought to bee, in things of great im|portance, aduisedly to take the first occasions. We reade of <HI>Haniball,</HI> when chasing home the Romanes to the gates of Rome, and neglecting then to scale the walles, could neuer after with all his strength and policies come neere the like aduantage: yet I must briefely tell you now, what I con|ceiue with ioy, that howsoeuer the businesse of this plantati|on hath beene formerly miscaried, yet it is now going on in better way, not enterprised by one or two priuate subiects, who in their greatnesse of minde, sought to compasse that, which rather beseemed a mighty Prince, (such as ours) or the whole State to take in hand: for it is not vnknowen to you all, how many Noble men of Honourable mindes, how many worthy Knights, Merchants, and others of the best disposition, are now ioyned together in one Charter, to receiue equall priuiledges, according to their seuerall aduen|tures: euery man engaging his purse, and some Noble-men, Knights and Gentlemen, intending to goe in their owne persons, which I did hears to protest and vow, against anie people, whomsoeuer shall any way seeke to entrappe or im|peach our proceedings, an vtter reuenge vpon their bodies or goods, if they be to bee found vpon Sea or land: whereby we haue assured hope (God assisting vs) to be effectually able to make good against all, and in short time to bring to a most happy euent the thing we take in hand.</P>
<P>And now in discribing the naturall seate and disposition of the countrie it selfe: if I should say no more but with <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Ioshua, The land which we haue searched out is a very good land, if the Lord loue vs, he will bring our people to it, and will giue it vs for a possession.</HI> This were enough to you that are willing, but yet a little more in
<PB REF="7">
particular obserued, by the best Mappes and Printed dis|courses, and by conference of such as haue b&eacute;ene lately there and s&eacute;ene it, I thinke good to deliuer to satisfie others: First the Uoyage is not long nor tedious, sixe W&eacute;ekes at ease will send vs thither, whereas sixe Moneths suffice not to some o|ther places, where wee Trade: our course and passage is thorow the great Ocean, where is no feare of Rockes or Flattes, nor subiect to the streighte and restraint of forraine Princes, most Winds that blow, are apt and fit for vs, and none can hinder vs: when wee come to the Coast, there is continuall depth enough, with good Bottome for Anchor hold, and the Land is faire to fall with all, full of excellent good Harbours: the world affoords no better for Ships of all burdens, many pleasant Ilands great and small affronting the Coast: Two goodly Riuers are discouered winding farre into the Maine, the one in the North part of the Land by our Westerne Colonie, Knights and Gentlemen of <HI>Exce|ster, Plymouth</HI> and others: The other in the South part thereof by our Colonie of <HI>London</HI>: Upon which Riuer, be|ing both broad, d&eacute;epe and pleasant, abounding with store of fish, our Colony haue begun to fortifie themselues, and haue built a towne, and named it (in honour of our King) <HI>Iames</HI> towne fourescore miles within land, vpon the North side of the Riuer (as is <HI>London</HI> vpon the Riuer of <HI>Thames</HI>) from whence wee haue discouered the same Riuer, one hundred myles further into the mayne Land, in the searching where|of, they were so rauisht with the admirable sweetnesse of the streame, and with the pleasant land trending along on either side, that their ioy exc&eacute;eded and with great admiration they praised God.</P>
<P>The country it selfe is large and great assuredly, though as yet, no exact discouerie can bee made of all, It is also commendable, and hopefull euerie way, the ayre and clymate most sw&eacute;ete and wholsome, much warmer then <HI>England,</HI> and very agr&eacute;eable to our Natures: It is inha|bited with wild and sauage people, that liue and lie vp and
<PB REF="8">
downe in troupes, like heards of Deare in a Forrest: they haue no law but nature, their apparell skinnes of beasts, but most goe naked: the better sort haue houses, but poore ones, they haue no Arte nor Science, yet they liue vnder superior commaund, such as it is, they are generally very louing and gentle, and doe entertaine and relieue our people with great kindnesse: they are easie to be brought to good, and would fayne embrace a better condition: the land yeeldeth natural|lie for the sustentation of man, aboundance of fish, both scale and shell: of land and water fowles, infinite store: of Deere, Rain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> and fallow, Stags, Coneys, and Hares, with many fruits and rootes good for meate.</P>
<P>There are valleyes and plaines streaming with sweets Springs, like veynes in a naturall bodie: there are hills and mountaines making a sensible proffer of hidden treasure, ne|uer yet searched: the land is full of mineralles, plentie of woods (the wants of England) there are growing goodly Okes and Elmes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">eech and Birch, Spruce, Walnut, Ce|dar and Firre trees, in great aboundance, the soile is strong and lustie of it owne nature, and sendeth out naturally fruit|full Uines running vpon trees, and shrubbes: it yeeldeth also Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">n, Turpentine, Pitch and Tarre, Sassafras, Mulbery-trees and Silke-wormes, many Skinnes and rich Furres, many sweete woodes, and Dyers woodes, and other costly dyes: plenty of Sturgion, Timber for Shipping&punc; Mast, Plancke and Deale, Sope ashes, Cauiare, and what else we know not yet, because our daies are yong. But of this that I haue said, if bare nature be so amiable in it naked kind, what may we hope, when Arte and Nature both shall ioyne, and striue together, to giue best content to man and beast? as now in handling the seuerall parts propounded, I shall shew in order as they lie.</P>
<P>For the first (if I forget not my selfe) how it may tend to aduance the Kingdome of God, by reducing sauage people from their blind superstition to the light of Religion, when some obiect, wee seeke nothing lesse then the cause of God,
<PB REF="8">
being led on by our owne priuate ends, and secondly how we can warrant a supplantation of those Indians, or an inuasi|on into their right and possessions.</P>
<P>To the first we say, as many actions both good in them|selues, and in their successe, haue b&eacute;ene performed with badde intents: so in this case, howsoeuer our naughtines of minde may sway very much, yet God may haue the honor, and his Kingdome aduanced in the action done: but yet by the way, me thinks this obiection comes in due time, and doth wel ad|monish vs, how to rectiffe our hearts and ground our medi|tations before we begin: we doe generally applaud, and high|ly commend the goodnes of the cause, and that it is such a profitable plough, as euery honest man ought to set his hand vnto, both in respect of God and the publike good this, is our generall voice, and we say truth, for so it is.</P>
<P>But wee must beware that vnder this pretence that bit|tet root of gr&eacute;edy gaine be not so setled in our harts, that b&eacute;e|ing in a golden dreame, if it fal not out presently to our expec|tation, we flinke away with discontent, and draw our purses from the charge. If any shew this affection, I would wish his basenes of minde to be noted. What must be our direction then, no more but this: if thou dost once approue the worke, lay thy hand to it ch&eacute;erefully, and withdraw it not till thy taske bee done, at all assayes and new supplies of money be not lagge, nor like a dull horse thats alwaies in the lash, for h&eacute;ere lies the po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">son of all good attempts, when as men without haling and pulling, will not bee drawne to perfor|mance, for by this, others are discouraged, the action lies vn|done, and the first expence is lost: But are wee to looke for no gaine in the lewe of all aduentures? yes vndoubtedly, there is assured hope of gaine, as I will shew anon in due place, but look it be not chiefe in your thoughts, God that hath said by <HI>Solomon: Cast thy bread vpon the waters, and after many daies thou shalt find it:</HI> he will giue the blessing: And as for supplanting the sauages, we haue no such intent: Our intrusion into their possessions shall tend to their great good,
<PB REF="9">
and no way to their hurt, vnlesse as vnbridled beastes, they procure it to themselues: Wee purpose to proclaime and make it knowne to them all, by some publike interpretation that our comming thither is to plant our selues in their coun|trie: yet not to supplant and roote them out, but to bring them from their base condition to a farre better: First, in regard of God the Creator, and of Iesus Christ their Red&eacute;emer, if they will bel&eacute;eue in him. And secondly, in respect of earthly blessings, whereof they haue now no comfortable vse, but in beastly brutish maner, with promise to defend them against all publike and priuate enemies. W&eacute;e can remember since <HI>Don Iohn Daquila</HI> with his forces inuading <HI>Ireland,</HI> a no|ble ciuill kingdome, where all (except a few runagates) were setled in the truth of Religion, and liued by wholsome lawes, vnder the milde gouernment of Christian Kings and Prin|ces, long before his grandsiers cradle: yet h&eacute;e thought it no robberie to proclaime and publish to the world, that his com|ming thither, was to none other end, but to free the Nation from their bondage, and tyrannous subiection, and to bring the blind soules to Catholike Religion: a plausible pretence, the least end of his thought.</P>
<P>But if this were coyned in those dayes by the Minters themselues, to passe for currant thorow the world, howso|euer base it was ind&eacute;ede, w&eacute;e hope they will be as fauourable to our case, and giue as fr&eacute;e passage and allowance to our in|uasion, much more currant, and so farre different, as not to bring a people (according to our prouerbe) out of the frying panne into the fire, but to make their condition truely more happy, by a mutuall enterchange and commerce in this sort: That as to our great expence and charge, w&eacute;e make aduen|tures, to impart our diuine riches, to their inestimable gaine, and to couer their naked miserie with ciuill vse of foode, and clothing, and to traine them by gentle mesnes to those ma|nuall artes and skill, which they so much affect, and doe ad|mire to s&eacute;e in vs: so in lewe of this, w&eacute;e require nothing at their hands, but a quiet residence to vs and ours, that by our
<PB REF="9">
owne labour and toyle, we may worke this good vnto them and recompence our owne aduentures, costs and trauells in the ende: wherein, they shalbe most friendly welcome to con|ioyne their labours with ours, and shall enioy equall priui|ledges with vs, in whatsoeuer good successe, time or meanes may bring to passe. To which purpose, wee may verily be|leeue, that God hath reserued in this last age of the world, an infinite number of those lost and scattered sheepe, to be won and recouered by our means, of whom so many as obstinat|ly refuse to vnite themselues vnto vs, or shall maligne or di|sturbe our plantation, our chattel, or whatsoeuer belonging to vs: they shall be held and reputed recusant, withstanding their owne good: and shall bee dealt with as enemies of the Common-wealth of their countrie: wherby how much good we shall performe to those that be good, and how little iniu|ry to any, wil easily appeare, by comparing our present hap|pinesse with our former ancient miseries, wherein wee had continued brutish, poore and naked Britanes to this day, if <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> with his Romane Legions (or some other) had not laid the ground to make vs tame and ciuill.</P>
<P>But for my second point propounded, the honour of our King, by enlarging his Kingdomes to proue how this may tend to that: no argument of mine can make it so manifest, as the same is cleere in it selfe: Diuine testimonies shew, that the honour of a King consisteth in the multitude of subiects, and certainely the state of the Iewes was farre more glori|ous, by the conquests of <HI>Dauid,</HI> and vnder the ample raigne of <HI>Solomon,</HI> then euer before or after: The twelue Tribes were then all subiect: the bordering Nations tributarie&punc; no doubt a happie subiection to many of them: wherby they had the better meanes to beleeue and know God the Creator of heauen and earth: Honourable I graunt is iust Conquest by sword, and <HI>Hercules</HI> is fained to haue had all his felicity, in subduing and rooting out the Tyrants of the world, but vn|fainedly it is most honorable indeede, to subdue the tyranny of the roaring Lion, that deuoures those poore soules in their

ignorance, and leads them to hel for want of light, when our Dominions shall be enlarged, and the subiects multiplied of a people so bought and ransomed&punc; not by stormes of raging cruelties (as west India was conuerted) with rapiers point and Musket shot, murdering so many millions of naked In|dians, as their Stories doe relate, but by faire and louing meanes, suting to our English natures, like that soft and gentle voice, wherein the Lord appeared to <HI>Elias:</HI> How ho|norable wil this be, in the sight of men and of ages to come? but much more glorious in the sight of God, when our King shal come to make his triumph in heauen. The prophet <HI>Da|niel</HI> doth assure, that for this conquest of <HI>turning manie vnto righteousnesse,</HI> hee shall shine as the starres for euer and euer.</P>
<P>And yet this is not all that may be saide, the auncient law, the law of <HI>Moses</HI> settes it downe, as a blessed thing, when the Prince and people of God, shall bee able to lend to all, and neede to borrow of none, and it added very much to the fame and wisedome of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> which the world came <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">arre and neere to wonder at, in that his Kingdomes were replenished with golde and siluer in aboundance, and with riches brought in by shippes, sent yearely forth in am|ple trade of Merchandize, whereof wee reade not the like a|mong all the Kings of Israel. And vpon good warrant I speake it here in priuate, what by these new discoueries in|to the Westerne partes, and our hopefull setling in chiefest places of the East, with our former knowne trades in other parts of the world, I doe not doubt (by the helpe of God) but I may liue to see the dayes (if Marchants haue their due encouragement) that the wisedome, Maiestie, and Ho|nour of our King, shall be spread and enlarged to the ends of the world, our Nauigations mightily encreased, and his Ma|iesties customes more then trebled.</P>
<P>And as for the third part, the releeuing our men already planted, to preserue both them and our former aduentures, I shall not neede to say much, the necessitie is so apparent,

<P>Our Sauiour <HI>Christ</HI> resembles them that giue ouer in their best duties, to foolish builders, that hauing laid the foun|dation, doe grauell themselues in the midde way and so be|come ridiculous: It had b&eacute;ene extreame madnes in the <HI>Iewes</HI> (when hauing sent to spye the land that flowed with milke and honey, and ten for two returned backe with tydings of impossibilitie to enter and preuaile,) if then they had retyred and lost the land of promise: No doubt, the Deuill that enui|ed then that enterprize of theirs&punc; doth now the like in ours, and we must make accompt, and look to bee encountred with many discoragements, partly by our friends and neighbours, (such as we vse to say) will neither goe to Church nor tarrie at home, as also (which is no new thing) euen by such as haue b&eacute;en sent to spy the land, one while obiecting the charge will be great, the businesse long, and the gaines nothing, and besides&punc; the <HI>Anakimes</HI> that dwell in the mountaines, will come and pull vs out by the eares, with such like fooleries I know not what.</P>

<P>And now it followes, how it can be good for this Com|monwealth: which is likewise most apparant many waies.
<PB REF="11">
First, if we consider what strength of shipping may be ray|sed and maintained thence, in furnishing our owne wants of sundrie kindes, and the wants of other Nations too, in such needfull things arising thence, which can hardly now be ob|tained from any other part of the world, as planck and tym|ber for shipping, with Deale and Wainscot, pipestaues and clabbord, with store of Sope ashes, whereof there grow the best woods to make them in great aboundance, al which we may there haue, the wood for the cutting, and the Ashes for the burning, which though they bee grosse commodities, yet no Marchandize is better requested, nor will sooner yeelde golde or siluer in any our bordering Nations. England and Holland alone, spend in these about three hundreth thou|sand poundes sterling euery yeare: we may transport hether or vnto Hamborough, Holland, or other places, fiftie <HI>per centum</HI> better cheape, then from Prusia or Polonia, from whence they are onely now to be had, where also the woods are so spent and wasted, that from the place where the wood is cut and the ashes burnt, they are brought by land at least two hundred miles to ship. And from thence we may haue Iron and Copper also in great quantitie, about which the expence and waste of woode, as also for building of Shippes, will be no hurt, but great seruice to that countrey: the great superfluity whereof, the continuall cutting downe, in manie hundred yeares, will not be able to ouercome, whereby will likewise grow a greater benefite to this land, in preseruing our woodes and tymber at home, so infinitely and without measure, vpon these occasions cutte downe, and falne to such a sickenesse and wasting consumption, as all the physick in England cannot cure.</P>
<P>Wee doubt not but to make there in few yeares store of good wines, as any from the Canaries, by replanting and making tame the Uines that naturally grow there in great abundance, onely send men of skill to doe it, and Coopers to make caske, and hoopes for that and all other vses, for which there is wood enough at hand.</P>
<P><PB REF="11">There are Silke-wormes, and plenty of Mulberie-trees, whereby Ladies, Gentlewomen and litle children, (beeing set in the way to doe it) may bee all imploied with pleasure, in making Silke, comparable to that of <HI>Persia, Turkey,</HI> or any other. We may bring from thence Sturgion, Cauiare, and new land-fish of the best. There grows hempe for Cor|dage, an excellent commoditie, and flaxe for linnen cloth; which beeing sowen and well manured, in such a clymate and fertile soyle, will make great benefite, and will put downe that of other countries.</P>
<P>And for the making of Pitch, Tarre, Turpentine, Sope-ashes, Deale, Wainscott, and such like, wee haue alreadie prouided and sent thither skillfull workemen from Forraine parts, which may teach and set ours in the way, whereby we may set many thousands a worke, in these and such like ser|uices.</P>
<P>For as I tolde you before, there must be Art and industry with other helps and meanes extended, with a little pacience to bring these things to passe, wee must not looke to reape with ioy, except we sow in teares: The aboundance of King <HI>Salomons</HI> golde and siluer, did not raine from heauen vpon the heads of his subiects: but heauenly prouidence blessed his Nauigations and publike affayres, the chiefe meanes of their wealth.</P>
<P>Experience hath lately taught vs by some of our neigh|bour Prouinces, how exc&eacute;edingly it mounts the State of a common-wealth, to put forth Nauigation (if it were possible) into all parts and corners of the world, to furnish our owne wants, and also to supply from one Kingdome to another, such seuerall n&eacute;edefull things, as for want of shipping and o|ther meanes they cannot furnish of themselues, for this will raise experience, and men of skill, as also strength at Sea and land, with honour, wealth, and riches, returning still to the heads and Fountaines, from whence their first occasions grew.</P>
<P>Wee may but looke a little backe, and wee shall see what
<PB REF="12">
a nouice our nation was within these sixscore yeeres, in case of Forraine trade, not knowing whence to fetch, nor which way to transport, but onely to some marte or staple towne, within two daies sailing&punc; and that was counted so great a matter then, that therefore they were called Mar|chant aduenturers, and the great Hulkes of <HI>Italy,</HI> which in those daies brought spices Corants and such like, and landes at <HI>Southampton,</HI> (the Storehouse then for Marchandize) are Chronicled for wonders in our <HI>English</HI> Stories, for in|deede we knew no better then, but were content (as babes) with <HI>Easterlings</HI> on the one hand &amp; <HI>Lumbards</HI> on the other, which were continuall Liegers in <HI>London,</HI> and fed vs as they listed.</P>
<P>And take this euer as a rule, that Domesticke Marchan|dizing brings forth but poore effects in a Commonwealth, whereof I needed not haue shewed example further then our owne doores.</P>
<P>What was the case of <HI>England</HI> before the golden daies of Qu&eacute;ene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> at whose comming to the crowne, the state of Marchants was so poore and meane, that renting out her customes in wardes, but at a very lowe rate, yet it brought the farmer vpon his kn&eacute;es.</P>
<P>A man that markes the difference, and shall compare those times and these together, shall thinke it were impossi|ble, (vnlesse his knowledge taught him otherwise) that the dayes and raigne of one <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> whose hand was euer lending, to distressed neighbour Princes, and her sword vn|sheathed continually, repulsing forraine enemies, should yet releeue and raise the state of her customes, the strength of her Nauie&punc; and the condition of her people, euery way seuen fold to that they were before, onely by encouraging the roy|all trade of Marchandize, as wee see it this day apparant: Let God haue the honour, and blessed be her memory, and the memoriall of those managers of State in her daies, for their worthy counsells, many of which though they now sl&eacute;epe, and rest with their <HI>Soueraigne</HI> in peace, yet some doe
<PB REF="12">
still remaine, and do succeede in place, where long may they stand and their s&eacute;ede after them, like the Pillars and Wor|thies of King <HI>Dauid,</HI> to shielde the head and honour of our <HI>Solomon,</HI> and still to vphold and enlarge our happinesse for euer: and this I am driuen to speake and mention by the way, where I meant it not, in regard of some which vpon a disaster beginne to ware weary of all, discouraging them|selues and others, from this and all other forreine aduen|tures: to let them know, that each thing hath encrease, from whence it had beginning: and to put our selues in mind, that wee faile not in furthering those causes that bring forth such effects.</P>
<P>Another instance might be shewed in one particular, which taxeth very much our English Nation, and all the Subiects of our soueraigne King, that enioying such plentie of wood|lands, and fruitfull soiles, within England, Scotland, Ire|land and Wales: yet our want of industry to bee such, that Netherlanders which haue not a stick of wood growing nor any land for sowing, should surpasse and goe beyond vs in continuall plenty of corne and shipping, me thinks the refor|mation hereof should find more fauour at our hands, that in such points of ciuil pollicie, no people of lesser meanes should cast vs so behinde, and each well minded man should lend his helpe to heale and cure such staines and scarres in the face of our state, as being viewed and wayed well, may very well make vs blush.</P>
<P>And now to our present businesse in hand, which so many stumble at, in regard of the continuall charge, I would haue them know, that it cannot be great nor long, as the businesse may be handled. Two things are especially required herein, people to make the plantation, and money to furnish our pre|sent prouisions, and shippings now in hand: For the first we neede not doubt, our land abounding with swarmes of idle persons, which hauing no meanes of labour to rel&eacute;eue their misery, doe likewise swarme in lewd and naughtie practises, so that if we seeke not some waies for their forreine employ|ment,
<PB REF="13">
wee must prouide shortly more prisons and correcti|ons for their bad conditions, for it fares with populous com|mon weales, as with plants and trees that bee too frolicke, which not able to sustaine and feede their multitude of bran|ches, do admit an engrafting of their buds and Siences into some other soile, acounting it a benefite for preseruation of their kind, and a disburdening their stocke of those superflu|ous twigs that sucke away their nourishment. And we shal find that hence it was, the Gothes and Uandalles with o|ther barbarous nations, s&eacute;eing an ouerflowing of their mul|titudes at home, did therefore send their Armies out as ra|ging floods at sundrie times, to couer the faces of Spain, Ita|ly and other Prouinces, to f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&eacute;e their owne from pestering: so that you see it no new thing, but most profitable for our State, to rid our multitudes of such as lie at home, pestering the land with pestilence and penury, and infecting one ano|ther with vice and villanie, worse then the plague it selfe: whose very miseries driues many of them, by meanes to be cutte off, as bad and wicked members, or else both them and theirs to be rel&eacute;eued, at the common charge of others.</P>
<P>Yet I doe not meane, that none but such vnsound mem|bers, and such poore as want their bread, are fittest for this imployment: for wee intend to haue of euery trade and pro|fession, both honest, wise and painefull men, whereof our land and Citie is able to spare, and furnish many (as we had experience in our last sending thither) which will be glad to goe, and plant themselues so happily, and their children after them, to holde and keepe conformitie, with the lawes, lan|guage and religion of England for euer,</P>
<P>Touching which, I doe earnestly admonish you to be|ware and shunne three kindes of people: the first, a most vile minded sort, and for the most part badde members of this Citie, by some meanes shaken out of their honest cour|ses, and now shifting by their wittes, will bee alwaies de|uising some vnhappines to wrong the plantation: such as daily beate their braines, and s&eacute;eke by lying suggestions; vn|der

colour of good pretence to the Common-wealth to in|fringe our auncient liberties, and would (if they were not mette withall and curbed by authoritie) make a monopoly to themselues, of each thing after other, belonging to the free|dome of euery mans profession, the very wrack of Merchan|dizing.</P>
<P>The second sort are papists, professed or Recusant of which I would not one, seasoned with the least taint of that leauen, to be setled in our plantation, nor in any part of that country, but if once perceiued, such a one, w&eacute;ede him out, and ship him home for England, for they will euer bee plotting and conspi|ring, to root you out if they can, howsoeuer they sweare, flat|ter, and equiuocate, beleeue them not: keepe onely these two examples in minde.</P>
<P><HI>Watson</HI> the Seminarie priest in his printed <HI>Quodlibets:</HI> he, of all other men protesteth the greatest truth and fidelity to his Prince and countrey; obiecting all the bloudy plottes and treasons, to haue come from the combination of <HI>Iesuits,</HI> and from <HI>Parsons</HI> that Arch-Atheist in chiefe, but as for himselfe, hee wished no longer to liue and breath, then the thoughts of his hart should be true and vpright to his prince and Countrey: Notwithstanding, this <HI>Watson</HI> was the very first wretch of all other, that had his hand in treason a|gainst our King, and reapt his reward according to his wish.</P>
<P>The other example is a Popish Pamphlet, called the Lay Catholikes Petition, offered to his Maiestie for tolleration of Popery, protesting likewise their fidelitie and vnfained loue to his Maiestie, offering to be bound life for life with good suerties for their loyall behauiour: happy&punc; men had we b&eacute;ene to haue taken their bonds, (no doubt) for euen at that instant, when this petition was exhibiting, the chiefe heads of those lay Catholikes, were then labouring with all their might, to vndermine the Parliament house, to shake the Pillers, and the whole frame of the Kingdome to shi|uers&middot;</P>
<P><PB REF="14">And which is more, there is newly dispersed an idle dis|course against an honorable personage of this Land, by a Papist, that termes himselfe a Catholike Diuine, defending <HI>Garnet</HI> the popish Priest; saying, there was nothing against him at his arraignement, but onely his acquaintance with the Powder-plotte: which (saith hee) beeing reuealed vnto him in auricular confession, hee might not therefore by the lawe and right of Catholike religion, disclose nor make it knowne.</P>
<P>How like you these Catholikes and this diuinitie? if they grow so bold and desperate in a mighty setled State, howe much more dangerous in the birth and infancie of yours? Therefore if you will liue and prosper, harbor not this vipe|rous broode in your bosome, which will eat out and consume the wombe of their mother.</P>
<P>The third sort to auoide, are euill affected Magistrates, a plague that God himselfe complaines of by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah: O my people, they that leade thee, cause thee to erre.</HI> Touching which, I am no way able to speake en|ough, for herein lies the very life of all: let no partialitie pre|ferre them, vnlesse they be worthy men; if they be papists or popishly minded; if prophane Atheists, contemning God and his word, turning religion to policy, vnchaste, idle, ambi|tious, proud and tyrannous, forgetting their allegiance to their King, and duety to their country, neglecting their com|mission of imployment, aduancing vil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e and vitious persons like themselues, and basely vsing those that bee vertuous, godly, and well affected: then looke for no blessing nor assi|stance of God, but misery, crosses, and confusions in all w&eacute;e take in hand: but in men of knowledge, and religious educa|tion, there is euer found true humilitie, temperance and iu|stice, ioyned with confidence, valour and noble courage, such as was in <HI>Moses</HI> the man of God, whose iustice exc&eacute;eded, and courage was incomparable, and yet the m&eacute;ekest man that went vpon the earth: tenne of such will chase an hun|dred: no aduersitie can make them despayre, their prouident
<PB REF="14">
care wil euer be to repulse iniuries, and represse the insolent, to encourage the paineful and best minded, to employ the idle to some honest labours, and to releeue with mercy and com|miseration, the most feeble, weakest and meanest mem|ber.</P>
<P>And as for the generall sort that shall goe to bee planters, bee they neuer so poore, so they b&eacute;e honest, and painefull, the place will make them rich: all kinde of Artificers wee must-first imploy, are Carpenters, Ship-wrights, Masons, Saw|yers, Brickemakers, Bricklayers, Plowmen, Sowers, Planters Fishermen, Coopers, Smiths, Mettel-men Tay|lers, Turners, and such like, to make and fitte all necessaries, for comfort and vse of the Colony, and for such as are of no trades (if they bee industrious) they shall haue there imploy|ment enough, for there is a world of means to set many thou|sands a work<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, partly in such things as I mentioned before, and many other profitable workes, for no man must liue i|dle there.</P>
<P>And by this imploiment, we may happily stop the course of those Irregular youths of no religion, that daily run from vs to <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Rhemes</HI> for exhibition, which after a little hammering and trayning there by <HI>Parsons</HI> and his Impes, they become pliable for the impression of any villany what|soeuer, as appeares by their positions and practises at home and abroad.</P>
<P>And hereby our Marriners shall not lie idle, nor our Ow|ners sell their ships for want of freight: you know how ma|ny good ships are daily solde, and made away to forreine nati|ons: how many men for want of imploiment&punc; betake them|selues to <HI>Tunis, Spaine</HI> and <HI>Florence,</HI> and to serue in courses not warrantable, which would better beseeme, our owne walles and borders to bee spread with such branches, that their natiue countrey, and not forreine Princes, might reape their fruit, as beeing both exquisite Nauigators, and resolute men for seruice, as any the world affoords.</P>
<P>Wee intend to Plant there (God willing) great plentie
<PB REF="15">
of Sugar Canes, for which the soyle and clymate is very apt and fit; also Linseed, and Rapes&eacute;eds to make Oiles, which be|cause the soyle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s strong &amp; cheape, may there be sowed and the oyle made to great benefite: wee must plant also Orenges, Limons, Almonds, Annis&eacute;eds, Rice, Cummin, Cotten wool, Carowey s&eacute;eds, Ginger, Madder, Oliues, Oris, Sumacke and many such like, which I cannot now name, al very good Marchandize, and will there grow and increase, as well as in <HI>Italy</HI> or any other part of the streights, whence wee fetch them now. And in searching the land, there is vndoubted hope of finding Cochinell, the plant of rich Indico, Graine|berries, Beauer Hydes, Pearles, rich Treasure, and the South sea, leading to <HI>China,</HI> with many other benefites which our day-light will discouer.</P>
<P>But of all other things, that God hath denied that coun|trie, there is want of Sheepe to make woollen cloth, and this want of cloth, must alwaies bee supplied from England, whereby when the Colony is thorowly increased, and the <HI>Indians</HI> brought to our Ciuilitie, (as they wil in short time) It will cause a mighty vent of <HI>English</HI> clothes, a great bene|fit to our Nation, and raising againe of that auncient trade of clothing, so much decayed in England: whose lifting vp againe (me thinkes I see apparantly approching, by the good dispositions of our best sort of Citizens, who willing|ly engage themselues to vndertake all new discoueries, as into this of the West, and by the North West to finde out <HI>China.</HI> And vnto the East beyond the <HI>Cape,</HI> into the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the gulfe of <HI>Persia,</HI> the streights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> and among al the Kings of <HI>India,</HI> for the good and honour of our Nation: Which calles to minde, a blinde Prophesie in one of the <HI>Si|bells,</HI> that before the ende of the world there shall be a dis|couerie of all Nations: which shall come to bee knowne and acquainted together, as one neighbour with another, which since the confusion of tongues haue lyeu obscure and hid.</P>
<P>But howeuer that bee, yet these good mindes and resolu|tions,
<PB REF="15">
doe serue for imitation to others, and do deserue assured|ly the best encouragement, whereby wee shall not still be|take our selues to small and little Shipping (as wee day|ly doe beginne) but shall reare againe such Marchants Shippes both tall and stout, as no Forreine Sayle that swimmes shall make them vaile or stoope: wherby to make this little Northerne corner of the world, to be in short time the richest Store-house and Staple for Marchandize in all Europe.</P>
<P>The second thing to make this plantation is money, to be raised among the aduenturers&punc; wherein the sooner and more d&eacute;eply men engage themselues, their charge wil be the shorter, &amp; their gaine the greater, as in this last point which I haue to speake for the good of each particular Aduenturer, I will make it plaine.</P>
<P>First you shall vnderstand, that his Maiestie hath graun|ted vs an enlargement of our Charter, with many ample pri|uiledges, wherein we haue Knights and Gentlemen of good place: Named for the Kings counsell of <HI>Virginia</HI> to gouerne vs: As also euery Planter and Aduenturer shall bee inser|ted in the Patent by name: This ground being laide, wee purpose presently to make supply of Men Women and chil|dren (so many as we can) to make the Plantation. Wee call those Planters that goe in their persons to dwell there: And those Aduenturers that aduenture their money and go not in person, and both do make the members of one Colo|nie. We do account twelue pound ten shillings to be a sin|gle share aduentured. Euery ordinary man or woman, if they will goe and dwell there, and euery Childe aboue tenne yeares, that shall be caried thither to remaine, shalbe alow|ed for each of their persons a single share, as if they had ad|uentured twelue pound ten shillings in money. Euery extra|ordinarie man, as Diuines, Gouernors, Ministers of state and Iustice, Knights, Gentlemen, Physitions, and such as be men of worth for speciall seruices, are all to goe as planters, and to execute their seueral functions in the Colonie, and are
<PB REF="16">
to be maintained at the common charge, and are to receiue their Diuident (as others doe) at seuen yeares end, and they are to be agr&eacute;ed with all before they goe, and to be rated by the Councell, according to the value of their persons: which shalbe set downe and Registred in a booke, that it may al|waies appeare what people haue gone to the Plantation, at what time they went, and how their persons were valued: And likewise, if any that goe to bee planters will lay downe money to the Treasurer, it shall bee also registred and their shares inlarged accordingly&punc; be it for more or less. Al charges of setling and maintaining the plantation, and of making supplies&punc; shall be borne in a ioint stock of the aduenturers for seuen yeares after the date of our new enlargement: during which time there shal be no aduenture, nor goods returned in priuate from thence, neytheir by Master, Marriner, Plan|ter nor passenger, they shal be restrained by bond and search, that as we supplie from hence to the Planters at our owne charge all necessaries for food and apparel, for fortifying and building of houses in a ioynt stock, so they are also to returne from thence the encrease and fruits of their labours, for the vse and aduancement of the same ioynt stocke, till the end of seuen yeares: at which time wee purpose (God willing) to make a diuision by Commissioners appointed, of al the lands graunted vnto vs by his Maiestie, to euery of the Colonie, according to each mans seuerall aduenture, agr&eacute;eing with our Register booke, which wee doubt not will bee for euery share of twelue pound tenne shillings, fiue hundred acres at least. Now if any thinke that we shal be tyed to a continual charge, of making new supplies for seuen yeares, let them conceiue thus much, that if wee doe it thorowly at the first, by engaging our selues at once, in furnishing many men and other meanes: assuredly after the second yeare, the returnes from thence wil be able with an ouer-plus, to make supplies at large, so that our purses shalbe freed, and the ouer-plus of stock will also grow to greatnes, which stock is also (as the land) to be diuided equally at seuen yeares end or sooner, or so
<PB REF="16">
often as the company shall thinke fit for the greatnes of it, to make a Diuident.</P>
<P>And as by this w&eacute;e shall be soone freed from charge and expence, so there grows a greater benefit to the planters (by bestowing their labours ch&eacute;erefully) to make returne of Stocke, for hereby the sooner they f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing vs from disburs|ments, the more our shares and portions will be lessened in the Diuident of Stocke and land at seuen y&eacute;eres end&punc; where|by the lesse comming to vs, the more will be to them, so that h&eacute;ere is no discouragement any way, if men will be capable to doe themselues good. But if wee will be so wise to linger, and lie in the winde, to heare what newes, to bring in our Stocke next yeare, and when we are behinde for foure or fiue Aduentures, we come dropping in with one or two and still runne in arrerages for twice so much: (For I know many that would bring in stocke amongst vs, but they lie out to s&eacute;e what successe first: and vpon such like termes.) Is this Gen|tleman-like or Marchant-like, in truth it is paultry, and such as would bring all to naught, if we should bee so minded too, and I tell you true, our single shares wil make but a hun+gry Plantation, if we doe not at the least double them now: and therefore I vrge it the more, for that the very life of all is now in the beginning by making our supplies thoroughly, and thence will our gaines arise both sooner and certaine. yet I graunt that others may come in hereafter at any time, eyther to aduenture h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s person or money, or both, but if there be spent one yeere of the seuen before he comes in, or h&eacute;e that comes in with the first shall notwithstanding b&eacute;e a yeare behinde in supplies, they shall be both alike shortened in a seuenth part of the Diuident both of stocke and lands, and if two yeeres behinde, then shortned two seuenths, and if but sixe moneths, yet a fourt&eacute;enth part, for euery man is Regi|stered according to the time, his money or person beganne to aduenture, or made supply, so that they which come late&punc; get not the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> of those that bore the first brunt of the busines, and this will neither aduantage him that withholds nor hin|der

<P>And as for the diuisions of landes at seuen yeeres ende which (some may obiect) will be little worth&punc; and vnequally d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">uided: let them vnderstand, that no man shall haue his lot entirely in one place, to be al of the best, or al of the worst, but each man shall haue proportionably to his aduentures, in thr&eacute;e or foure distinct differences, that may bee made in the goodnes or badnes of the groundes by Commissioners e|qually chosen by the Aduenturers h&eacute;ere, and the Planters there; and as for the value and little worth now, of those grounds in <HI>Virginia,</HI> we know that in England within these thirty or fortie yeeres, the y&eacute;erely rent of those grounds (in many places) were not worth fiue shillings, that now do goe for fourtie and more.</P>
<P>And howsoeuer those grounds in <HI>Virginia</HI> are now but little worth ind&eacute;ede, yet time and meanes will make them better, considering how they passe our grounds in <HI>England,</HI> both in regard of the soile and clymate, fitte for many preci|ous vses: And also in how many seuerall places we purpose to plant our Colony, and not to bestow our costs vppon <HI>Iames-towne</HI> onely, and vpon the grounds lying therea|bout, and to let al&punc; the rest lie barren: for seeing his Maiestie hath graunted to our Colony as much circuite of ground as all <HI>England</HI> almost we purpose (God willing) if wee may be supplied with sufficient meanes) to settle out of hand, sixe or seuen plantations more, al vpon, or neare our main-riuer, as capitall townes, twenty miles each from other, and euery plantation shall manure and husband the lands and grounds lying n&eacute;ere vnto it, and alotted for the circuite thereof, and
<PB REF="17">
shall all endeuour for a ioynt stocke, and shall be still suppli|ed from hence with more money and prouisions, and against any publike iniury shall be ready to vnite, and ioyne them|selues together. and by this mea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">es wee shall come to haue our Diuident in landes of worth and well manured, which will be eyther bought or rented of vs at a good value by the planters, or by such as intend hereafter to inhabite there, as also by these seueral plantations (which happly one place bet|ter fitting then another) wee shall bring forth more seuerall sorts of Marchandize, and be also better fortified: and besides the Planters will be in such hope to haue their owne shares and habitations in those lands, which they haue so husband|ed, that it will cause contending and emulation among them, which shall bring foorth the most profitable and beneficiall fruits for the ioynt stocke.</P>
<P>Whereby vndoubtedly, we shall be soone fr&eacute;ed from fur|ther expence, our gaines will grow&punc; and our stocke encrease, we shall fell our tymber, saw our planck, and quickly make good shipping there, and shall returne from thence with good imployment, an hundred saile of good Shippes yearely, all which good and much more, wee shall withstand and bring our selues into a laborinth, if wee pinch and spare our purses now: therefore not to holde you longer with many wordes, (being neere Exchange time as I take it) remember what I haue said in prouing my proposition, and take my conclu|sion in a word or two.</P>
<P>S&eacute;eing our prouocations are so many, our cause and title good, auaunt all idle oracles that seeke to bar vs: The wise|dome of the wisest saith in these cases, <HI>VVhatsoeuer thy hand shall find to doe, do it with all thy might.</HI></P>
<P>Our forefathers not looking out in time, lost the prime and fairest proffer of the greatest wealth in the world, and we taxe their omission for it, yet now it falles out, that wee their children are tryed in the like, there being yet an excel|lent portion left, and by Diuine prouidence offered to our choice, which (seeing we haue armes to embrace,) let it not
<PB REF="18">
be accounted hereafter, <HI>As a prize in the hands of fooles, that had no hearts to vse it.</HI></P>
<P>The honour of our nation is now very great by his Ma|iesties meanes and wee his subiects cannot enlarge and vp|hold it by gazing o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, and talking what hath b&eacute;ene done, but by doing that good, which may bee commended hereafter, if we sitte still and let slip occasions, we shall gather rust, and doe vnfeather our owne wings, committing the folly of the wise Romanes heerein, that in time of their glory, flowing with the Conquestes and spoiles of the world, and hauing gotten the Goddesse <HI>Victoria</HI> to Rome, they clipt her wings&punc; and set her vp among their Gods, that sh&eacute;e might take her flight no more, as shee had formerly done from the Gretians and others, and so effeminating their valour with idlenesse and security, it brought confusion and ruine to their state.</P>
<P>Let not such a prize of hopefull euents, so lately pur|chased by the hazard of our valiant men&punc; in the d&eacute;epe Seas of forreine dangers, now perish in the Hauen by our neglect, the liues of our friends already planted, and of those noble Knights and Gentlemen that entend to goe shortly, must lie at our mercy to be rel&eacute;eued and supplied by vs, or to be made a prey vnto others (though wee feare not the subiects of any Prince in amity, that they will offer wrong vnto vs:) And howsoeuer we heare tales and rumours of this and that, yet be not dismaid, for I tell you, if we find that any miscreants haue wronged, or goe about to hurt our few hundreds there, we shall be ready to right it againe with many thousands, like the giant <HI>Anteus,</HI> whose often foiles renued his strength the more.</P>
<P>And consider well that great worke of fr&eacute;eing the poore <HI>Indians</HI> from the deuourer, a compassion that euery good man (but passing by) would shew vnto a beast: their chil|dren when they come to be saued, will blesse the day when first their fathers saw your faces.</P>
<P>If those vndaunted English and Scottish Captaines&punc;
<PB REF="18">
that so often ventured their liues, and spilt their blood, to re|conquer Palestina from the Turks and Sarazens, had s&eacute;en the gappe so open in their daies, and the way leading to so many goodly purchases, certainely it had not now b&eacute;ene left for vs to doe. How strange a thing is this that al the States of Europe haue b&eacute;ene a sleepe so long? that for an hundred yeres and more, the wealth and riches of the East and West should runne no other current but into one coffer, so long til the running ouer, spread it selfe abundantly among a facti|ous crew of new created Friers, and that to no more speci|all end, then with instigating bloody plots to pierce the heart of a Christian State and true Religion.</P>
<P>It is long since I read in a little treatise, made by <HI>Frith</HI> an English Martyre, an excellent foretelling touching the happinesse of these Northerne Ilands, and of great won|ders that should bee wrought by Scots and English, before the comming of Christ, but I haue almost forgotten, and cannot readily call it to mind as I would, and therefore I omitte it now, Protesting vnto you, it would bee my griefe and sorrow, to bee exempted from the company of so many honorable minded men, and from this enterprise, tending to so many good ends, and then which, I truely thinke this day, there is not a worke of more excellent hope vnder the Sun, and farre excelling (all circumstances wayed) those Noble deeds of <HI>Alexander, Hercules</HI> and those heathen Monarks, for which they were deemed Gods among their posterity.</P>
<P>And so I leaue it to your consideration, with a memorable note of <HI>Thomas Lord Howard</HI> Earle of Surry, when K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, with his Nobles at Douer tooke shipping for Turwin &amp; Turney, and bidding the said Earle farewel, whom he made Gouernour in his absence, the Story sayth the Nobleman wept, and tooke his leaue with teares, an ad|mirable good nature in a valiant minde, greeuing to be left behinde his Prince and Peeres in such an honourable seruice.</P>
