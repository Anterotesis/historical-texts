<HEAD>To His Grace His Maje&s;ty's High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Right Honourable the E&s;tates of Parliament.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble Repre&s;entation and Petition of the Council-General of the Company of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Trading to <HI>A|frica</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Grace, and Right Honourable E&s;tates,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is evident by the whole Strain of Three &s;e|veral Acts of Parliament, together with His Maje&s;ty's Letters Patent under the Great Seal of this Kngdom, in favours of the &s;aid Company, That the Wi&s;dom of the King and Right Honourable E&s;tates did intend, that all &s;uch Advantages as might ari&s;e by the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;uch a Company, &s;hould be of as univer&s;ally a National Concern as po&s;&s;ible; And in order there|unto, were plea&s;ed to endow it with large Privi|ledges and Immunities, &s;uteable to the Circum|&s;tances of an Infant-Company, and the Great|ne&s;s of its De&s;igns: And le&s;t that it &s;hould fail
<PB N="4" REF="3">in the Execution, for want of a &s;ufficient Stock to carry on &s;uch an Undertaking, all imaginable Parliamentary Encouragement was given to Per|&s;ons of all Ranks, Ages and Sexes, both within and without the Kingdom, whether Natives or Foreigners, to become Partners and Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of the &s;aid Company, as is &s;in|gularly manife&s;t by the 42d. Act of the 5th Se&s;&s;ion of this current Parliament, &s;pecially calculated for that end only.</P>
<P>Upon the publick Faith of having due Prote|ction in the enjoyment of the&s;e unque&s;tionable Priviledges and Immunities, as having received their Sanction from His Maje&s;ty, and the unani|mous Suffrage of the Great Council of the Nation as afore&s;aid, many Per&s;ons of all Ranks and De|grees were thereby induced to become Adventu|rers in the Joint-Stock of our &s;aid Company, in &s;o much that in a very &s;hort time, a much more con&s;iderable Stock was &s;ub&s;crib'd for within this Kingdom, than was ever before &s;o much as pro|pos'd here upon any Project what&s;oever, &s;ince we were a Nation.</P>
<P>Being thus entred into a Society, We and our Con&s;tituents have pur&s;uant to the intentions of the Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above|mention'd, with much care and trouble, and a great Expen&s;e of Trea&s;ure, after having &s;truggled with many unexpected Ob&s;tructions and Difficul|ties, &s;etled a Plantation, by the Name of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> in one of the mo&s;t Healthful, Fruitful, natural|ly impregnable, and every way valuable Places in all <HI>America,</HI> as is univer&s;ally acknowledged by all Per&s;ons of Experience in &s;uch Matters, as well as by the General Con&s;ent of &s;uch as have been
<PB N="5" REF="3">there: And as a manife&s;t proof thereof tho' our &s;aid Plantation be &s;etled mo&s;t &s;trictly in the terms of the Acts of Parliament and Letters patent above-mentioned, yet it has rai&s;ed the Jealou&s;y of &s;ome, and Envy of others, of the mo&s;t knowing and con&s;iderable Trading Nations in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But to our and the Nations great Surpri&s;e, and ine&s;timable Lo&s;s, while we were u&s;ing all ordina|ry means, and big with the hopes of riveting that Settlement upon a la&s;ting Foundation, &s;uch was the further continued Chain of unexpected Ob|&s;tructions and mo&s;t unaccountable Mal treatments that we met with, by Proclamations of a very &s;trange Nature, and otherwi&s;e, that the repeated Misfortunes following thereupon, put us under an indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity of humbly petitioning His Maje&s;ty for allowing the Parliament to meet at the day appointed in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t; in full confidence and Expectation of having the mo&s;t natural and cordial A&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e who fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed our Company&punc; and promi&s;ed it Protection; e&s;pecially &s;ince all our other Appli|cations have hitherto proved ineffectual: But a meeting of the E&s;tates in Parliament at that time not quadrating (it would &s;eem) with His Ma|je&s;ty's other Affairs, a very con&s;iderable Body of the Nobility, Gentry, and Burge&s;&s;es of this King|dom, thought fit, in a mo&s;t dutiful and humble manner, by their late Addre&s;s, to repre&s;ent to His Maje&s;ty, how deeply they were affected with the Nations concern in our Company's repeated Misfortunes, and therefore humbly Petitioned for the &s;itting of this Parliament as &s;oon as conve|niently might be. And the King having been mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to order the Meeting of
<PB N="6" REF="4">the Right Honourable E&s;tates now in Parliament, We think our &s;elves in all duty bound to give His Grace His Maje&s;ty's High Commi&s;&s;ioner and the Right Honourable the E&s;tates, a &s;hort and naked Narrative of the &s;everal Ob&s;tructions, and Misfortunes that we have been all along forc'd to grapple with in the pro&s;ecution of our Company's De&s;igns, to the end that the great Council of the Nation, having a perfect View and full Knowledge of the&s;e Difficulties which we now Labour under, may be the better able to to judge how to apply a Remedy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempt for &s;trengthning our Com|pany's Intere&s;t and Stock was at <HI>London,</HI> where a Sub&s;cription of 300000 <HI>sterl.</HI> was procured in Nine days time, without &s;o much as a publick Adverti&s;ement, and many knowing Merchants were &s;o far convinc'd of the many Advantages that might probably ari&s;e from &s;uch a Con&s;tituti|on, that they &s;ignified their willingne&s;s to be concerned for Triple the Sum, if allowed: But not only did the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> by their Addre&s;s to His Maje&s;ty of the 13th of <HI>December</HI> 1695. and otherways, render that Sub&s;cription ineffectual, but the Hou&s;e of Commons did al&s;o appoint a Committee, <HI>to examine what Methods were taken for obtaining the Act of Parliament, by which our &s;aid Company is e&s;tabli&s;hed, who were the Promoters and Advi&s;ers thereof;</HI> and did afterwards impeach the Nominees in the &s;aid Act of Parlia|ment; notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;olute Indepen|dency of this Kingdom:</P>
<P>Yet after all this Di&s;couragement, we went on with our Sub&s;criptions at home, and made our next Effort for &s;trengthning thereof beyond Sea,
<PB N="7" REF="4">both in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> In the fir&s;t of which places many eminent Merchants declared their po&s;itive inclinations to be very con&s;iderably intere&s;ted with us, and gave &s;ome &s;ignal Proofs thereof, till they were made to under&s;tand by Threatnings and other In&s;inuations, that a Higher Power would make them at lea&s;t very unea&s;y, if they per&s;i&s;ted any further in their Re&s;olutions of being concerned with our Company.</P>
<P>And at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> where we had the mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing Hopes of foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the <HI>Commercii</HI> or Merchant-Company, entred into Contract with our Company's Deputees, to joyn at lea&s;t 200000 <HI>l. Sterl:</HI> to our Company's Stock; but to our great A&s;toni&s;hment. His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Brit|tains</HI> Mini&s;ters there, did, under pretence of &s;pe|cial Warrant from the King, put a full &s;top there|to, by giving in <HI>A Memorial to the Burgo-Ma&s;ters &amp; Gentlemen-Councellours of that City, wholly di&s;-owning the Authority of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent above mention'd, and intimating that His Maje&s;ty would regard their entring into Treaties with our Company as an Affront to His Royal Authority, and that he would not fail to re&s;ent it, as having neither Credential Let|ters nor being any otherways Authoriz'd by His Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Upon notice whereof, we did in all humble Duty Addre&s;s His Maje&s;ty in <HI>June</HI> 1697, for Re|dre&s;s of that open and bold Encroachment, upon not only our, but al&s;o the Nations Rights, in its mo&s;t fundamental Con&s;titution, by endeavouring to &s;ubvert the Independency of its Parliamentary Laws, expre&s;ly contrary to the Law of Nations: All which His Maje&s;ty by His Royal Letter from <HI>Flanders</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1697, <HI>Promi&s;ed to take into Con&s;ide|ration, as &s;oon as he would return into</HI> England, <HI>&amp; that in
<PB N="8" REF="5">the mean time, His Maje&s;ty would give Orders to His Mi|ni&s;ters at</HI> Hamburgh, <HI>not to ob&s;truct our Company in the pro&s;ecution of its Trade with the Inhabitants of that City.</HI></P>
<P>In the full Confidence of His Maje&s;ty's Royal Promi&s;e, we thought our &s;elves &s;ecure, and took our Mea&s;ures accordingly, till to our further &s;ur|prize, we found by &s;everal In&s;tances, that His Ma|je&s;ty's &s;aid Mini&s;ters were as wickedly bent again&s;t us as ever, and &s;till denying that they had got any &s;uch Orders from His Maje&s;ty: whereupon the Di|rectors of our Company, did, by their Letter of the 28 of <HI>September</HI> 1697, expo&s;tulate in the fir&s;t place, with both the then Secretaries of State, about that further Di&s;-appointment, but having &s;till no Redre&s;s the rein, we did in mo&s;t humble and dutiful Manner, by our &s;econd Addre&s;s of the 22d. day of <HI>December</HI> 1697. lay the whole Matter again before His Maje&s;ty; And did likewi&s;e, at the &s;ame time, not only humbly Repre&s;ent the Premi&s;&s;es to His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable Privy-Council, together with the train of ill Con&s;equences that mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arly attend &s;uch Treatment, if not prevented by an early Redre&s;s; but wrote al&s;o &s;eparatly to both the Secretaries of State, and &s;uch other Noble Per&s;ons of the Government, as happen'd to be then at <HI>London,</HI> To u&s;e their Joint-Intere&s;t, for procuring Ju&s;tice, in a Matter of &s;uch Univer|&s;al Concern to the Honour, Intere&s;t, and Indepen|dency of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>All the An&s;wer we obtain'd, was by a Letter of the 17th. of <HI>January</HI> 1698, from both the Secre|taries of State: <HI>That the King &s;aid, He had already given Orders to His Re&s;ident at</HI> Hamburgh <HI>in that Matter, conform to His Royal Letter from</HI> Flanders, <HI>in</HI> July 1697, <HI>which was then communicated to the Com|pany.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>By which An&s;wer, together with what repeat|ed Advices we had at the &s;ame time from <HI>Ham|burgh,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters there, had &s;till po&s;itively di&s;owned their having got any &s;uch Or|ders, we were put out of all Hopes of having any Redre&s;s, until we &s;hould have an Oppertunity of laying the whole Matter before a Meeting of the E&s;tates of Parliament.</P>
<P>But in the mean time we proceeded, with all the Strength we had (tho' extremely weakned by the Treatment above-narrated) to make the be&s;t Preparations we could (con&s;idering the Scarcity of the&s;e Years) for fitting out an Equipage of Ships, Men, Provi&s;ions, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for &s;ettling a Plantation in <HI>America,</HI> in the Terms of the Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent a|bove-mention'd: And its evident by the very Con&s;titutions of the Colony, that they were cal|culated more for the general Advantage of the Nation and Po&s;terity, than for the particular and immediat Benefit of the Adventurers.</P>
<P>And the Parliament happening to meet the ve|ry next Day after our Ships had &s;ail'd, we did, by our Humble Petition of the 22d. of <HI>July</HI> 1698, Repre&s;ent to his Grace, His Maje&s;ties then High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Right Honourable E&s;tates then a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, the Treatment which our Company met with at <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Ham|burgh</HI> as afore&s;aid, the great Prejudices which we had &s;u&s;tain'd thereby, and the many further In|conveniencies and evil Con&s;equences that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly have followed thereupon, if, upon a|ny Account what&s;oever, the Parliament &s;hould happen to neglect the taking immediat Cogni|zance of &s;uch U&s;age.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<P>And the Parliament having thereupon, by their Unanimous Addre&s;s of the 5th. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1698, to His Maje&s;ty, thought fit to manife&s;t <HI>their own, and the whole Nations Concern in that Matter, earne&s;t|ly entreating, and most a&s;&s;uredly expecting, That His Maje&s;ty would, in His Royal Wi&s;dom, take &s;uch Mea|&s;ures, as might effectually vindicat the Undoubted Rights and Priviledges of the &s;aid Company, and &s;upport the Credit and Intere&s;t thereof;</HI> And the Parliament like|wi&s;e, by the &s;ame Addre&s;s, <HI>recommending the Con|cerns of the &s;aid Company to &s;ome &s;pecial Marks of His Maje&s;ties Royal Favour, as that Branch of the Trade of this Kingdom, in which they, and the Nation they re|pre&s;ented, had a more peculiar Intere&s;t;</HI> The Court of Directors of our Company were thereby encou|rag'd to renew their Application to His Maje&s;ty, with relation to the Memorial given in by His Mini&s;ters to the Senate of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> (the &s;ame being &s;pecially mention'd in the Parliaments Ad|dre&s;s:) And in Con&s;ideration of the Damnages &s;u&s;tain'd by the Company, through Means of that Memorial, the Directors humbly Petition'd, That His Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed, for their Encouragement at that time, as a Gracious Mark of His Royal Favour, to be&s;tow upon them the two &s;malle&s;t of the Frigots, then (and to this Hour) lying u&s;ele&s;s in <HI>Brunti&s;land</HI> Harbour.</P>
<P>But our Company having no manner of An|&s;wer to either of the&s;e, and being a&s;&s;ured by &s;eve|ral Letters from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> That both the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters there, had po&s;itively denyed their ha|ving received any &s;uch Orders, as were long be|fore promi&s;ed, and declared to have been given, with relation to that Memorial, the Court of Di|rectors of our Company did, by their Letter of
<PB N="11" REF="6">the 29th. of <HI>November</HI> 1698, tran&s;mit Copies of the &s;aid Letters to the Vi&s;count of <HI>Seafield,</HI> then &s;ole Secretary of State, and entreated his Lord|&s;hip, to procure &s;ome &s;peedy and effectual An&s;wer from His Maje&s;ty to the Contents of both that Letter, and their former Petition.</P>
<P>The Secretary, by his Letter of the 13th. of <HI>De|cember</HI> 1698, returned for An&s;wer, <HI>That he would take the fir&s;t convenient Opportunity he could have, to repre&s;ent that Matter to the King, but that he could not expect to have it for &s;ome time, becau&s;e His Maje&s;ty was then very much imployed in the Affairs of His</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>We thereupon waited a full Month, in expecta|tion of &s;ome further An&s;wer, but getting none, our Court of Directors did, by a Letter of the 13th. of <HI>January</HI> 1699, put the Secretary again in mind of our &s;aid Petition of the preceeding <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and Letter of the 29th. of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>The Secretary, by his Letter of the 7th. of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 1699, &s;ignified, <HI>That he had pre&s;ented our Com|pany's Petition to His Maje&s;ty, and was commanded to let us know, that there being Accounts, that the Ships belonging to the Company were arriv'd upon the Coa&s;t of</HI> America, <HI>and the particular De&s;ign not being commu|nicated to His Maje&s;ty, He therefore delayed to give any An&s;wer, until he &s;hould receive certain Information of their Settlement.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' we could not but be &s;urpriz'd, to find all our former Addre&s;&s;es and Petitions, about Mat|ters of &s;uch weighty Concern, as are above-nar|rated, An&s;wered, after &s;o long Delay, only with a &s;eeming Charge, for not having communicated to His Maje&s;ty a thing that was never in the lea&s;t demanded of us, by either the King, Parliament,
<PB N="12" REF="7">Privy Council, or Mini&s;ters of State, we being limited to &s;ettle in the Terms of the Acts of Par|liament, as we &s;hould be An&s;werable: Yet upon the very fir&s;t Advice we had of our Colony's Settlement in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> we, by our Letters of the 31&s;t. of <HI>March,</HI> and 1&s;t. of <HI>April</HI> 1699, gave a ve|ry full and dutiful Account thereof to His Maje|&s;ty, and to both the Secretaries of State, together with an Account of the <HI>French</HI> De&s;igns thereabouts, and of what Import our &s;aid Settlement (if duly protected) might prove to the Intere&s;t and Se|curity of all His Maje&s;ties Dominions, and refer|red the &s;ame, together with the Contents of our former Petitions, to His Maje&s;ties Royal Con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>About this time it was, That His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to call the Pre&s;ident of the Se&s;&s;ion, and the Advocat to Court, to the end (as we under|&s;tood) that they, jointly with both the Secreta|ries of State, might, in a Conference with &s;eve|ral of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters, &s;atisfy His Maje&s;ty, as to the Legality of our Company's Settlement: Which (by all that ever we could learn) was then (and otherways &s;ince that time) made clear beyond all manner of Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>But while, in the mean time, we were pawn|ing even our own particular Credits, for &s;ending the needful Supplies of Ships, Men, Provi&s;ions, Arms, Ammunition, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for &s;ecuring &s;o valuable a Settlement to this Nation, we were a&s;toni&s;hed to have Advice, That, by Or|ders from <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 1699, Proclama|tions had been emitted, in the Months of <HI>A|pril</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> over all His Maje&s;ties Plantations and Territories in <HI>America,</HI> &s;trictly Intercommu|ning
<PB N="13" REF="7">our Colony, under very &s;evere Penalties to be inflicted on the Contraveeners of the&s;e Procla|mations, <HI>in regard that His Maje&s;ty</HI> (as the&s;e Pro|clamations narrate) <HI>was unacquainted with the In|tentions and De&s;igns of the</HI> Scots <HI>&s;ettling at</HI> Darien.</P>
<P>As we humbly con&s;idered the&s;e Proclamations to be &s;uch, as were never before publi&s;hed in tho&s;e parts, again&s;t any other People upon Earth, and of &s;o Barbarous a Nature, as we thought, no Good Chri&s;tians would put in Execution, even again&s;t Infidels; So finding our &s;elves unque&s;tio|nably warranted by all Laws Humane and Divine, we per&s;i&s;ted in our Endeavours for maintaining that Settlement, as hoping, that, through means thereof, this Nation might, in time, have an Opportunity of rai&s;ing it &s;elf above the open Contempt, Reproach and In&s;ults of its unkind Neighbours, and of propagating the Go&s;pel a|mong&s;t the Ignorant good Natur'd <HI>Indians</HI> of tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>But before our Recruits could po&s;&s;ibly arrive at <HI>Caledonia,</HI> our Colony got certain Accounts of the&s;e Proclamations; and finding at the &s;ame time, the &s;ad Effects thereof, by being denied any the lea&s;t Help, either for Goods or Money, at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> from whence they had formerly Sup|plies; And that in the Proclamation i&s;&s;ued by Sir <HI>William Be&s;ton,</HI> Governour of that I&s;land, he had po&s;itively declared, <HI>That by their Settlement in</HI> Darien, <HI>they had actually broken the Peace entred into with His Majesties Allyes</HI> (which they believed he dur&s;t not venture to have done without a &s;ufficient Warrant) And finding them&s;elves thereby to be of con&s;equence declared Pirates, without any previous Summons or Hearing, contrary to the
<PB N="14" REF="8">Cu&s;toms and common U&s;age of all Nations, even in the ca&s;e of real Piracy, and founding a Belief, at the &s;ame time, on the Treatment which they knew our Company had formerly met with in <HI>Europe,</HI> without being Redre&s;s'd therein, that we were not in a Condition either to &s;upply or pro|tect them, they unhappily took the Alarm, un|der &s;uch a General Con&s;ternation, as deve&s;ted them not only of all manner of patience to &s;trug|gle with any Inconveniencies they lay under at the time, but al&s;o of all manner of prudence, in taking any rea&s;onable Mea&s;ures either for their own Security, or for our Company's intere&s;t. In the mid&s;t of which Confu&s;ion tho&s;e of them who had any bad De&s;igns (as we could not well &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Number to be free of &s;ome) made u&s;e of the&s;e Proclamations as handles, by which to perpetrate their own &s;everal ends, and ea&s;ily per&s;waded all the re&s;t to leave the Settlement: Which they unadvi&s;edly did the 20th of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t; And by that means not only have the Ships, Men &amp; Goods, which were there at that time, been ex|po&s;ed to the Arbitrary will of tho&s;e to whom the Execution of tho&s;e Proclamations was given in Charge, but even all our &s;ub&s;equent Mea&s;ures brought into inevitable di&s;order.</P>
<P>Upon Information of all which, we did, by our humble Petition to His Maje&s;ty of the 19th of <HI>October</HI> 1699, in all humility and earne&s;tne&s;s, beg, <HI>That His Maje&s;ty would in His Fatherly care for the good of our Company in particular, and of the Na|tion in General, be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give &s;pecial Te&s;timonies of his Majestys Royal Protection to our Com|pany at that Juncture, and particularly to take off the Force and effect of tho&s;e Proclamations which have been &s;o prejudicial to us, and to &s;ignify his Royal plea&s;ure to
<PB N="15" REF="8">the Governours of his Plantations in</HI> America, <HI>that our Colony might be&s;upplied in the common and ordinary way of Commerce as tho&s;e of other Nations are; And that in the mean time His Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow the E&s;tates of Parliament to meet at the day ap|pointed in</HI> November <HI>la&s;t, or as &s;oon as conveniently could be, to the end that their Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance might be had in &s;uch a weighty and General Concern.</HI></P>
<P>We likewi&s;e, by our humble Addre&s;s to His Ma|je&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council of the 20th of <HI>October</HI> 1699, Repre&s;ented what we thought in duty and prudence nece&s;&s;ary, with relation to the Contents of our &s;aid Petition to his Maje&s;ty, <HI>Humbly referring the whole to their Lord&s;hips mo&s;t &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration, and praying that they would be plea|&s;ed to do us all the good Offices with His Maje&s;ty that they'd think mo&s;t expedient for &s;upporting our Company and Colonys Interest; and to give him an account of our Company's hard Circumstances, and how much the Ho|nour and Intere&s;t of the Nation &s;tood concern'd therein.</HI></P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by His Royal Letter to us of the 2d. of <HI>November</HI> 1699, to declare that. <HI>He did very much regret the Lo&s;s which the Kingdom &amp; the Company had lately &s;u&s;tain'd, That he would upon all occa&s;ions protect and encourage the Trade of the Nation. That he would take care that His Subjects of this Kingdom &s;hould have the &s;ame free|dom of Trade and Commerce with his</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Planta|tions that ever they had formerly, and that he would order the Parliament to meet, when he'd judge that the Good of the Nation would require it.</HI></P>
<P>But, in &s;ome &s;hort time thereafter, while we were &s;olacing our&s;elves with the Hopes of having His Ma|je&s;ty's protection, not only as a Company e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, by His Royal Authority, with the Advice and Con&s;ent of Parliament, but al&s;o as Subjects, mak|ing
<PB N="16" REF="9">all the Preparations we could, to &s;end the need|ful Supplies and Advices to tho&s;e who were la&s;t &s;ent for Repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Settlement: We were further a&s;toni&s;hed to have Advices that, by &s;econd Orders from <HI>England,</HI> another Fleece of Proclamations had been emitted over all the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> particularly on the 5th. of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t in <HI>Barbados,</HI> &amp;c. And that in complyance with the intent of the&s;e Proclamati|ons, Our People that went along with the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun,</HI> were in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, po&s;itively denyed Wood and Water at <HI>Mon&s;erat,</HI> a Priviledge never before denyed to any other Nation: And by a Letter of the 29th. of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t from the Com|mander of another of our Company's Ships, we are a&s;&s;ured that they were po&s;itively denyed Ancho|ring at St. <HI>Christophers</HI> by the Governour Colonel <HI>Norton,</HI> who out of his own Mouth declared to the Commander of our &s;aid Ship, That he did it by new Orders which he had received about a Month before; altho at the &s;ame time two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were then Watering there; which we have &s;ince confirmed to us by Letters from Mr. <HI>Daniel Mackay,</HI> one of the Councellours of our Colony, dated at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Jamaica</HI> the 13th. <HI>February</HI> la&s;t: By which Letters, he informs us likewi&s;e, That when he waited upon the Governour of that I&s;land, concerning our Company's Ship the St. <HI>Andrew</HI> lying in that Harbour, The Governour declared to him, That tho' the &s;aid Ship were fitted for going to Sea, he would not &s;uffer her to go, without a &s;pecial Order from <HI>England</HI> for that Effect.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e humbly beg leave to inform Your Grace, and Right Honourable E&s;tates, That a|mong&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="9">our Company's many other Lo&s;&s;es and Mi&s;-fortunes, a Ship called the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> ladned with a valuable Cargo, belonging to our Company, &s;truck Unfortunatly on a Rock, by which &s;he &s;prung a Lake, and being forc'd to run a&s;hoar under the Walls of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> to e&s;cape Ship|wrack, the &s;aid Ship and Goods were by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (His Maje&s;ty's Allies) violently &s;eized and di&s;po&s;ed of as Prize, and the Men al&s;o to the Number of 30 and a Boy, detain'd, and made clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, not only contrary to the Law of Na|tions, (we being then in profound Peace with them) but al&s;o contrary to the expre&s;s Terms of the 10. and 11. Articles of the Treaty concluded at <HI>Madrid</HI> the 8/18 Day of <HI>July</HI> 1670, between the Crowns of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>By our dutiful Addre&s;s of the 4th. of <HI>December</HI> 1699, we humbly Petition'd His Maje&s;ty, <HI>That He would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to take the&s;e Proceedings of the</HI> Spaniards <HI>into His Royal Con&s;ideration, &s;o as that &s;peedy and effectual Mea&s;ures might be taken for the Re|dre&s;s of the&s;e Damages, and the freedom of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pri&s;oners.</HI></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to which, His Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, by His Royal Letter of the 10th. of <HI>Janu|ary</HI> la&s;t, to &s;ignify, <HI>That He was re&s;olved in the Terms of the Treaties to demand from the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>that the&s;e Pri&s;oners &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Yet &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e Pri&s;oners being tran&s;ported above half a Year ago to Old <HI>Spain;</HI> We have frequent Advices from them by Letters, dated in <HI>Cadiz</HI>-Pri&s;on, That they and all the Crew have been mo&s;t Barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed, and that they them&s;elves are &s;till kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, under very &s;evere Treatment, Copies
<PB N="18" REF="10">of which Letters we have &s;ome Months ago tran&s;|mitted to the Secretaries of State.</P>
<P>By all which, it cannot but evidently appear to Your Grace and Right Honourable E&s;tates, that tho' we have all along us'd our be&s;t Endea|yours to wre&s;tle through the&s;e almo&s;t un&s;urmount|able Difficulties, and exerted even our utmo&s;t ef|forts for retrieving our Lo&s;&s;es, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by endeavouring to repo&s;&s;e&s;s and mantain &s;o valu|able a Settlement; And tho' we have certain Advice of its being Repo&s;&s;e&s;s'd by our People, and that we have taken all imaginable Mea&s;ures for their pre&s;ent Supply: Yet we have too ju&s;t ground to be fully per&s;waded, That unle&s;s the King and High Court of Parliament, do &s;peedily Support, Protect, and A&s;&s;i&s;t us, in the Pro&s;ecution of our Company's lawful De&s;igns, that all our Pa&s;t, Pre&s;ent, and Future Endeavours mu&s;t, to the Nations indelible Reproach and Di&s;honour; as well as to its and the Company's un&s;peakable and irreparable Lo&s;s, prove unavoidably abortive.</P>
<P><HI>May it therefore plea&s;e Your Grace and Right Honourable E&s;tates, to take the &s;everal Matters of Fact above-mentioned, into your mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration; To Vindicat, Support, and Protect us in the Enjoyment of our lawful Priviledges, both as a Company, and as Subjects of this free and independent Kingdom, to take &s;uch Mea&s;ures, as You (in Your pro|found Wi&s;dom) may judge mo&s;t Effectual, for repairing the many Damages we have
<PB N="19" REF="10">already &s;u&s;tain'd, and for a&s;&s;i&s;ting us in the further Pro&s;ecution of our Company's lawful De&s;igns; but more e&s;pecially, for the mantainance of our ju&s;t Right and Title to the Settlement of</HI> CALEDONIA, <HI>and the Enjoyment of &s;uch Advantages as (if duly Protected) may probably ari&s;e thereby.</HI></P>
