<HEAD><HI>The e&s;tate of Chri&s;tians, liuing</HI> vnder the &s;ubiection of the great Turke.</HEAD>
<P>_DIuers Countries and Nations are in &s;ub|iection of the Turke, and among the re&s;t, all Greece, &s;aue a ve|rie little parte of it, which is vnder the Segnorie of <HI>Venice:</HI> in&s;omuch that there be many thou&s;andes of Chri&s;tians &s;ubiect to Turki&s;h tyrannie. Where|of euen the be&s;t and greate&s;t are oppre&s;&s;ed with great toules and taxes, and pe&s;tered with infinit ex|tortions and paimentes yeerely. All the male chil|dren of Chri&s;tians are written vp at the day of their birth, and comming to ten or twelue yeres of their age, are pre&s;ented to the Turkes officers, who take all &s;uch as they finde well made, and like to proue fit men for &s;eruice in warre, from their parents, and conuey them to the Turkes, to bee brought vp in warlike exerci&s;es, and to become Turkes, and ene|mies
<PB N="2" REF="4"> to God, and their owne fathers and mothers, and kinsfolke, &s;tanding the Turke in more &s;ted than his own naturall people. And for each one of them that the Turks officers leaue at home, not thinking them fit for their turns, mu&s;t be paid yerely as good as eight &s;hillinges Engli&s;h, by their parentes, howe poore &s;o euer they be, for they mu&s;t find it or &s;mart for it. If anie chri&s;tian chance in anger or ha&s;tines, (as who is &s;o patient as not to be moued beeing &s;o &s;tinged) hauing receiued wrong, do &s;trike a Turke, he is &s;ure to be &s;o puni&s;hed, that if he doo liue after, he liueth to lament his life, &amp; to wi&s;h death. When the Turkes officers come to anie Chri&s;tians hou&s;e when they go in progre&s;&s;e, and make their vi&s;itati|ons, there mu&s;t be great &s;tore of cheere, and much co&s;t prouided to welcome them withall, or they wil be but ill come to the chri&s;tians that they come vnto. If anie Chri&s;tian releeue, or giue anie &s;uccor, aide or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to another Chri&s;tian fugitiue, he is taken pri&s;oner, &amp; be&s;ides the lo&s;&s;e of all his goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, kept in extreame mi&s;erie, and mo&s;t barbarou&s;lie handled till he paie for his ran&s;ome as much as they &s;hall appoint. Neither wil the Turks oftentimes be brought to relea&s;e them for any ran|&s;ome, but after a thou&s;and martirdomes wrought vpon them, they put them to death. Their puni&s;h|ments are diuer&s;e, &s;ome Chri&s;tians are tied hand &amp; foote, and laide on the ground, with a &s;tone almo&s;t of in&s;upportable waight on their backes. Others are put in gallies, where they be galled in deed and v&s;ed mo&s;t doggedly. Others they tie hand &amp; foote
<PB N="3" REF="4"> and laie them on their backes, and let a long rag of cipres or fine linnen dipped in pickle or &s;alt water, &s;inke by little and litle into their throats, till it reach downe to their &s;tomackes, and then they plucke it out againe, and &s;o put the poore Chri&s;tians to vn|&s;peakable paine and torment, When the Turkes haue taken anie Citie or forte of the Chri&s;tians, or haue ouercome any great armie, they lead all them that they put not mo&s;t cruelly to the &s;woorde, into mo&s;t lamentable captiuity, tormenting them in the fore&s;aid manner, and inflicting a thou&s;and woor&s;e martirdomes vpon them, which I will omit, they requiring a longer di&s;cour&s;e: &amp; I will rather praie vnto Almightie God to haue mercie vpon vs, and to defend all good people from the like afflictions. And howbeit that it plea&s;eth his diuine maie&s;tie to puni&s;h our wickedne&s;&s;e with &s;uch temporall tor|ments, yet that of his gracious mercifulnes he wold not &s;uffer &s;o many poore innocent children, being carryed awaie by force to me their fathers offences by loo&s;ing their &s;ouls: with which co&s;t many chri|&s;tians be&s;ides are dangerou&s;ly menaced, being part+ly mi&s;-lead by the vanitie of Turki&s;h pompe and pride enti&s;ing them, and partly oppre&s;&s;ed with po|uertie and mi&s;erie, con&s;training them to for&s;ake the true fountaine of life, to drinke of the puddle of in|fidelitie and pagani&s;me, therfore to abide euerla&s;t|ing thir&s;t. Wherefore we are bounden to pray vn|to Almightie God, to turne awaie &s;o much harme from his people, &amp; not only to keep them perpetu|ally in the way of the truth, that are alredy brought
<PB N="4" REF="5"> vnto it, but al&s;o &s;o to lighten the heartes and vnder|&s;tanding of the blinded, that &s;eeing the light of the Go&s;pell, they may imbrace it, and know that with|out the cleere Sunne-&s;hine of the &s;ame all light is but darkne&s;&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE VVARRES BETWEENE THE <HI>Chri&s;tians and the Turke.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe yeere 1592, Ha|zan, Ba&s;&s;a of Bo&s;&s;e|na, beeing Generall of the Turkes, go|ing out of Bo&s;&s;ena into Croatia, &s;o|dainly be&s;ieged, &amp; within a while toke the towne and Ca|&s;tell of Wihitz, the which had now 150. yeeres bene a &s;trong and &s;ure defence for the Chri&s;tians in that Countrie again&s;t the Turkes, who after the taking thereof, in fewe dayes built a blocke-hou&s;e and a bridge a litle way of, vpon the riuer Calapis: which being done, they
<PB REF="9"> burned and &s;poiled all the Countrie ouer between Calapis and Sauus. This &s;oddaine a&s;&s;aulte of the Turke, &s;troke great feare into the minds of the Au|&s;trians and Germanes. But Thomas Erdeud the Ban of Sclauonia, that hee might defend his owne Countrie Thuropoly from the&s;e inua&s;ions, mu&s;te|ring his owne forces, and getting certaine aide of the Au&s;trians, and other his neighbours, incamped him&s;elfe right ouer again&s;t the forte of Patirnia, which (as ear&s;t I &s;ayd) the Turkes had lately build|ed with the bridge. There he expected further &s;up|ply of men and munition, from the kingdomes of Sclauonia and Croatia. Which things Hazan Ba&s;|&s;a being certified of, by a trechour, a familiar of the Ban afore&s;ayd, retired by the neere&s;t waie, and &s;o|dainly a&s;&s;alted the chri&s;tians, who as yet knew not well what the number &amp; furniture of the enemies were. He came on the rereward with a huge pow|er, &amp; the hor&s;e men being put to flight, he &s;laughte|red the infanterie, and chiefly the Au&s;trians, and &s;o became ma&s;ter of their ordinance.</P>
<P>Then marched he forward without impeach|ment thorough all Thuropoly, and alonge the mo&s;t populous bankes of Calapis and Sauus, where hee gaue vnto death, and vnto bondage wor&s;e than death about foure thou&s;and men. Hee thought al&s;o to haue beene ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle of Si&s;&s;ek, &s;cituate at the concurrent of the two riuers Calapis and Sauus, becau&s;e it was a fit place for pa&s;&s;age into Au&s;tria, Carinthia, and Carniota, a
<PB REF="9"> thing which had &s;ometimes afore bene attempted, but then hee was nobly repul&s;ed by the rare worth of Nicholas Miccatius the gouernour, and the &s;in|gular valour of the garri&s;on &s;ouldiers, &s;o that after a fewe idle a&s;&s;aultes, hee was forced to giue it o|uer.</P>
<P>In Summer this pre&s;ent yere 1593. Aazan Ba&s;|&s;a, with certaine of the Sangiacbeges, whereof hee hath nine vnder his commaunde, returning to the be&s;iege of Si&s;&s;ek, fir&s;t razing Tre&s;china, a ca&s;tle of the Bi&s;hop of Zagabria, came before it about the beginning of Iune, &amp; hauing made many breaches by continuall battery night &amp; daie, there was now no hope of &s;afetie for the beleaguered, vnle&s;&s;e God beyond all thought, had &s;uccoured them. For al|though Ca&s;ars troupes, which were now mu&s;tered of the Au&s;trians, and the borderers thereabouts, were much fewer than the Turkes, yet the Ban of Sclauonia, and Auers Pergius, and Rupertus E|kenberger, &amp; diuers other nobles, among&s;t whom was Melchior Reder, Baron of Sile&s;ia, a man fa|mous both for learning and martiall affaires, ha|uing the leading of them.</P>
<P>When they behelde and &s;awe the Chri&s;ti|ans be&s;ieged, and brought to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;e, with heroike worth, and re&s;olute courage, bringing fir&s;t their armie into Si&s;&s;ec, they &s;allyed out on the Turkes, who had made a bridge ouer Calapis, and pitched theyr Tentes both on this and that &s;ide of the Riuer: they put them to flight that
<PB REF="10"> were on this &s;ide of the riuer, &amp; making them&s;elues ma&s;ters of a parte of the bridge, they cut it downe, &s;o that this part of the Turkes armie coulde not re|tire to the other, they &s;till peri&s;hed, and driue the retiring Turkes euen to the riuer, who rather com|mitted them&s;elues to the mercie of the water, than to the mercie of the victours. The other that were on the other &s;ide of the water, quite amazed by this &s;laughter of their fellowes, committed their &s;afetie to their feete. There were drowned in the riuer, Hazan Ba&s;&s;a afore&s;aid, with his brother, and Sinam Beg or pre&s;ident of Cli&s;ta, the &s;onne of Amurathes the Turkes &s;i&s;ter, and Memy Beg or pre&s;ident of Hertzegouin, which was the chiefe Citie of highe Bo&s;sina, &s;ometime a Dukedome, as Bagnia Luca, the &s;eate of Ba&s;&s;a, was the Metropolis of the kingdome of ba&s;e Bo&s;sina.</P>
<P>Amurath the Turke was &s;o grieued with this o|uerthrowe, wherein his &s;i&s;ters &s;onne, and the Ba&s;&s;a of Bo&s;sinas &s;elfe, with many other valiaunt men, were either &s;laine or drowned in Calapis, that part|ly through the wofull lamentations of his &s;i&s;ter, who at his feet de&s;ired reuenge of her &s;lain &s;onne, and partly by the per&s;wa&s;ion of Sinam, Ba&s;&s;a, and partly for the di&s;daine and griefe of the afore&s;ayde ouerthrowe, hee pre&s;ently denounced open warre vpon Rodolph the Emperor, and made Mahumet, Ba&s;&s;a of Temes warre, Deputy of Bo&s;&s;ena &amp; Cro|atia, with authoritie to pro&s;ecute the warre, and cau&s;ed the Deputie of Greece to aide him with an
<PB REF="10"> armie, and commanded the Ba&s;&s;a of Buda and the re&s;t, to put garri&s;ons in the ca&s;tells of the frontries, and to be at the command of Sinam Bas&s;hau of Ve|&s;irian, whom he &s;ent as his lieutenant generall into Hungarie.</P>
<P>Now the Chri&s;tians after the Turkes ouerthrow at Si&s;ek, taking re&s;pite for two moneths, began at la&s;t, though too late, to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle Petrinia, neere to Hra&s;towiz vpon Calapis, which the Turks had fortified the yere before: for hearing by a Turk a &s;pie (who came voluntary vnto them, and &s;o at his plea&s;ure went a waie) that the Deputie of Greece marched thether, though the Turkes in the Ca&s;tle be&s;ieged were in great di&s;tre&s;&s;e, wanting pouder, &amp; con&s;ulting to come to a parlie of &s;urrendering the holde, they rai&s;ed their &s;iege and departed. When this fame of the Turki&s;h warre, renued and pro|claimed in Con&s;tantinople and Buda, was bruited in Germanie, the yeerely pen&s;ion which had not beene paide rwo yeeres together, was without de|lay, the fir&s;t daie of Augu&s;t, carried from Vienna to Gamorrha. But pre&s;ently newes came that Sinan Bas&s;hau the Generall, marched into Hungary nere to Buda, &amp; that the forces of the deputie of Greece which were alreadie come into Croatia, had not onelie rai&s;ed the &s;iege at Petrinia, but had al|&s;o wonne Si&s;ck, and had cruelly ma&s;&s;acred and put to death all the garri&s;on &s;ouldiers, among whome were &s;ome Germanes, and had throwen their carca&s;es into the riuer Calapis, and that after|wards
<PB REF="11"> pa&s;sing ouer Sauus, euen to Sagabria, &s;poyl|ing &amp; burning as they went, they had taken about fiue thou&s;and men, whome they made theyr mi&s;e|rable bond &s;laues, &amp; that the &s;iege of Sagabria was expected euerie houre. Therefore they thought it be&s;t to take &s;ome other cour&s;e to withdrawe the e|nemie, and to vndertake a better courage of war|like defence. Therefore there went po&s;t to Prage Frances Nada&s;tus, the noble Duke of Hungarie, &amp; Deputie of Iaurin, Ferdinard Earle of Hardec, and diuer&s;e others of Au&s;tria, Carniola, Carinthia, and other places, who did aggrauate the greatne&s;&s;e of the danger by rea&s;on of the Turkes, &amp; complained that vnle&s;&s;e they had pre&s;ent aides, they &s;houlde of nece&s;sitie be con&s;trained to yeeld vnto them. The Emperour therefore gaue commandement to mu|&s;ter the Bohemians, Silue&s;ians, Moracians, Au&s;tri|ans, and other of his hereditarie princes, for &s;eruice on hor&s;eback and on foot, and to augment the gar|ri&s;ons in the limitanie holds, and &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adors to the electors of the Empire, for the holding of a parliament at Rauen&s;purg, for the vniting of the forces of the Empire, to with-holde the Turki&s;h crueltie from Germanie, and from other partes of Chri&s;tendome. He hired al&s;o great forces of hor&s;e and foote men again&s;t the next &s;pring, becau&s;e Ba&s;|&s;haw Sinam hauing taken We&s;pria and Palatta, threatned that he would without faile march into Vienna.</P>
<P>Ferdinand Samaria, and George Andrew of
<PB REF="11"> Hofkirchen were gouernors of We&s;tpriu, and had a garri&s;on of twelue thou&s;and &s;oldiers. Sinam Ba&s;|&s;a laide &s;iege to it the two and twentith of Septem|ber: he made three skonces vpon the high waies to Raba and Palatta, in the night he ca&s;t his trenches, and rai&s;ed twelue barricados on them, and began to batter the wall with the Canon, and &s;lue the ma|&s;ter of the Ordenaunce of We&s;tpriu with a &s;hot. They did little that daie, and therfore the next daie they intrenched them&s;elues neerer to the wall, and from &s;ixe &s;euerall places &s;o thundred vppon them, that almo&s;t no man could &s;tand in &s;afetie either on the wals or in the fortre&s;&s;es. Then after certaine a&s;|&s;aultes to &s;cale the wall, they were at la&s;t repul&s;ed with a large hail of the muskettiers. The next mor|ning had no &s;ooner giuen light to the fourth daye of the &s;iege, but the Turks fiercely renued the bat|trie, &amp; hauing &s;caled the wals, they began there to aduance their colours, but our &s;ouldiers put them to the foile. Being &s;o defeated, they threw balles of wilde fire on the gate, and on the wooden hou&s;es adioyning, and razed the wals neere to the gate, e|uen vnto the grounde: and giuing fre&s;h on&s;ets a|gain&s;t the gate and the ca&s;tle, and other places, they &s;o di&s;couraged the gouernor and the &s;ouldiers, that being now de&s;perate to defend the towne any lon|ger, becau&s;e there appeared no hope of &s;uccor from the gouernours of Raba and Pappa: the night fol|lowing they &s;ecretly i&s;&s;ued out of the citie, &amp; &s;oght to &s;aue them&s;elues by flight: but the Turks percei|uing
<PB REF="12"> it, pur&s;ued them as they fled: many of them they &s;lue, and tooke Ferdinand Samaria the gouer|nor him&s;elfe, and &s;ome other pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>There e&s;caped to Pappa in &s;afetie about fortie Germanes, and foure and fiftie Hungarians. On Saint Michaels euen the Turkes be&s;ieged Palatta, where two Hungarians that ranne awaie to them, are recorded to haue told them whence the ca&s;tle might be&s;t bee battered. But whereas the Ba&s;hau hauing &s;ent letters into the ca&s;tle, wherein hee per|&s;waded the garri&s;on &s;ouldiers which were foure hundred to yeelde the Ca&s;tle vnto him, &s;ith it &s;hould be a bootle&s;&s;e matter to make re&s;i&s;tance, &amp; promi&s;ed them life and &s;afe conduit if they would departt hauing voluntarily &s;urrendred it, they had in deede &s;afe conduite for one mil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, but after|wardes at a &s;igne giuen, they were almo&s;t all mur|thered, &s;o that of all, only foure &amp; twentie e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The thinges which followed had better &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e. For when intelligence was giuen by the cap|tiues and the &s;pies which Bas&s;hau Sinam by rea&s;on of the winter nowe approching, had di&s;po&s;ed his armes to their winteringes, and that him&s;elfe reuo|ked by Amurath, was gone poa&s;t to Con&s;tantino|ple, becau&s;e the Per&s;ians and the Georgians had certaine newe complots in hand, Ferdinand Earle of Hardec, Generall of the armie of ba&s;e Hunga|rie, ioyning to his, the Armies of Peter Hu&s;an go|uernour of Pappa, and of Nada&s;tus Earle of Serin, and of Palfius, and other Captaines, marched to|wardes
<PB REF="12"> Albie-royall, hauing &s;ome hope to get the &s;uburbes thereof, and the hou&s;e of the gouernor of the Citie, and the demaines. He therefore &s;ent Hu|&s;ar Peter to the further &s;ide of the Citie, with com|mandement that at midnight he &s;hould a&s;&s;ault the &s;uburbes, at what time hee him&s;elfe would giue a &s;igne, that he al&s;o made an a&s;&s;ault on the other &s;ide, that &s;o they might more ea&s;ily ouercome them, whome they did a&s;&s;aile in the &s;uburbs, their minds and forces beeing &s;o di&s;tract, and Hu&s;ar tooke and burnt one of the &s;uburbs, but the Turks defending the Citie, our men thought be&s;t, beeing de&s;titute both of victual &amp; munition, to for&s;ake it: and when as they had &s;car&s;e retired two miles, the next daie word was brought, that the Turkes in great troups followed them, and were determined to &s;et vppon them as they fled. Thereupon our men &s;taie, pau&s;e vpon the point, mar&s;hall the battell, and beard the enemy to his teeth, fighting valiantly, and God &s;tri|king amazement into the enemies heart, they turne the Ianizaries into flight, and obtain a noble victo|rie the four and twentith of October, according to the olde &s;tile. The Aga or Captaine of the Ianiza|ries being taken pri&s;oner, reported that the Ba&s;&s;a of Buda di&s;&s;waded them from fight, but that at la&s;t he was con&s;trained to go out to fight by the importu|nitie and threates of the &s;ouldiers. It is thought that hee hauing receiued three woundes with musket &s;hot, died afterwardes at Buda. There were in this skirmi&s;h be&s;ides the Bas&s;hau of Buda, the Sanzach
<PB REF="13"> or gouernour of Albie-roiall, of Strigon, of Pe&s;tis, of Fiukirks, of Moach, of Fillek, of New&s;tair, of Ze&s;|chen, of Copau, of Zolnock, of Zegedin, &amp;c. But I cannot tell whether anie of them were kilde or no. Ferdinand Earle of Hardec after this victorie at|chieued, returned to Raba in Iaurin.</P>
<P>In high Hungarie, Frederike Baron of Tieffen|bach, by force wonne from the Turkes the ca&s;tle of Zabacca, which they had fortified, where re&s;ting onely one daie, he brought his armie before Tillek a famous ca&s;tle and towne, the &s;eate of the Turkes Deputie, and two miles from the place afore&s;ayd. There on the twelfth of Nouember he put to flight the Turki&s;h armie, which was rai&s;ed of the Coun|tries adiacent, and came thether to rai&s;e the &s;iege. The next daie they rai&s;ed their rampires agayn&s;t the towne, and began to batter it, but the Turkes them&s;elues burnt that, and abandoning the ba&s;e skonce, the garri&s;on &s;ouldiers about eight hundred betooke them&s;elues to the gard of the high ca&s;tle a|lone, but at la&s;t with condition of their liues, they yeelded it by compo&s;ition. The fame of this &s;ur|render, cau&s;ed the Turkes which held the ca&s;tles of Diun and Hamaske neere thereto, to for&s;ake theyr holdes, and vna&s;&s;alted to flie awaie. Then was the armie brought before the towne and ca&s;tle of Zet|chen another holde of the Sangiachag, and wonne it with certaine of her ca&s;tles adioyning, of Holloc, Samos, and Plaue&s;teine: which the garri&s;ons wil|lingly for&s;aking lefte, to defend them&s;elues agayn&s;t
<PB REF="13"> the approching enemie. Towardes the ende of the moneth, Nogard (&s;o they commonly call it) and Sangiacaf, a famous towne became ours, and cer|taine Turkes of Albie-roiall bringing a new Depu|ty into the ca&s;tle of Palatte newly &s;urpri&s;ed, were in December by Huzar Peter valiantly put to the wor&s;e. But &s;ith the time of the yeere was &s;o vnfit, &amp; the continuall raine made the waies &s;o deepe, that their ordinance could not co~ueniently be haled fro~ place to place, and that the armye could not indure to lie incamped anie longer, they were on both &s;ides inforced to go to their wintering places. In the meane time Sinam the Ba&s;&s;a of Ve&s;irium was earne&s;tly expected at Buda, but he beeing gone to Con&s;tantinople, the deputy of Greece is recorded to haue come to Buda at la&s;t with a certaine power not of greate&s;t importance.</P>
