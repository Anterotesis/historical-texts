But the Ba|&s;haw, the Iani&s;aries not enduring his Apology, was pre&s;ently cut in pieces: &s;o that <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> after many changes is now in the hands of <HI>Hu|zein Ba&s;haw,</HI> who taking example by the for|mer affrightings, hideth as yet his panther ta|ients of policy concerning the augmentation of his owne honour, and falleth directly to the

In this manner was his wi&s;dome &s;o &s;ea|&s;onable, that the flames of this new &s;edition were delicately quenched: the Princes retur|ned to the pallace: <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Throne, him&s;elfe preuailed with their good opinion, and the whole body of the <HI>Ianizaries</HI> recouered from the growing infection of re|uolts and di&s;order, &s;o that the city was &s;ud|denly quieted, and all good gouernement ob&s;erued.</P>
