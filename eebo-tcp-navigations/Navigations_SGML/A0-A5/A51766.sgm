<HEAD>A MANIFESTO OR Declaration, Set forth by the Undertakers of the New Church Now Erected in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England, November</HI> 17th. 1699.</HEAD>
<P><HI>INASM&V;CH as GOD hath put it into our hearts to undertake the Building a New</HI> Meeting Hou&s;e <HI>in this Town for His Publick Wor&s;hip; And whereas through the gracious Smiles of Divine Providence on this our &V;ndertaking, We now &s;ee the &s;ame Erected, and near Fini&s;hed: We think it Convenient, for preventing all Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions and Jealou&s;ies, to publi&s;h our Aims and De&s;igns herein, together with tho&s;e Principles and Rules we intend by GODS Grace to adhere unto.</HI></P>
<P>We do therefore as in the Pre&s;ence of GOD our Judge, and with all the Sincerity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, which the nature of our pre&s;ent Engage|ment Commands from us, Profe&s;s and Declare both to one another, and to all the World, <HI>as follows.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[I.]</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, We approve and &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> put forth by the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[II.]</HEAD>
<P>We de&s;ign only the true and pure Wor&s;hip of GOD, according to the Rules appearing plainly to us in His Word; Conformably to the known practice of many of the Churches of the UNITED BRETHREN in <HI>London,</HI> and through|out all <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We judge it therefore mo&s;t &s;uitable and convenient, that in our Publick Wor|&s;hip &s;ome part of the Holy Scripture be read by the Mini&s;ter at his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>In all other parts of Divine Wor&s;hip as (Prayer, Singing, Preaching, Ble&s;&s;ing the People, and Admini&s;tring the Sacraments;) We conform to the ordinary practice of the Churches of Chri&s;t in this Country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<HEAD>[III.]</HEAD>
<P>It is our &s;incere de&s;ire and intention to hold Communion with the Churches here, as true Churches; and we openly prote&s;t again&s;t all Su&s;picion and Jealou&s;ie to the contrary, as mo&s;t Injurious to us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[IV.]</HEAD>
<P>And although in &s;ome Circum&s;tances we may vary from many of them; yet we joyntly profe&s;s to maintain &s;uch Order and Rules of Di&s;cipline as may pre&s;erve, as far as in us lies, Evangelical Purity and Holine&s;s in our Communion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[V.]</HEAD>
<P>In pur&s;uance whereof we further Declare, that we allow of Bapti&s;m to tho&s;e only who profe&s;s their Faith in Chri&s;t and Obedience to him, and to the Children of &s;uch; yet we dare not refu&s;e it to <HI>any</HI> Child offered to us by <HI>any</HI> profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian, upon his engagement to &s;ee it Educated, if God give life and ability, in the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>But this being a Mini&s;terial Act, We think it the Pa&s;tors Province to receive &s;uch Profe&s;&s;ions and Engagements; in who&s;e prudence and con&s;cience we ac|quie&s;ce.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[VI.]</HEAD>
<P>As to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, we believe that as the Ordinance is Holy, &s;o the Partakers in it (that it may not be vi&s;ibly profaned) mu&s;t be per|&s;ons of vi&s;ible Sanctity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[VII.]</HEAD>
<P>We judge it therefore fitting and expedient, that whoever would be admitted to partake with us in this Holy Sacrament, be accountable to the Pa&s;tor to whom it belongs to inquire into their knowledge and Spiritual State, and to require the Re|newal of their Bapti&s;mal Covenant.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[VIII.]</HEAD>
<P>But we a&s;&s;ume not to our &s;elves to impo&s;e upon any a Publick Relation of their Experiences; however if any one think him&s;elf bound in Con&s;cience to make &s;uch a Relation, let him do it.</P>
<P>For we conceive it &s;ufficient, if the Pa&s;tor publickly declare him&s;elf &s;atisfied in the per&s;on offered to our Communion, and &s;ea&s;onably Propound him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[IX.]</HEAD>
<P>We al&s;o think our &s;elves obliged in faithfulne&s;s to God, our own Souls, and theirs who &s;eek our Communion, to inquire into the life and conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who are &s;o propounded; and if we have ju&s;t matter of objection to prefer it again&s;t them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[X.]</HEAD>
<P>But if no objection be made, before the time of their &s;tanding propounded is expired, it &s;hall be e&s;teemed a &s;ufficient Con&s;ent and Concurrence of the Brethren, and the per&s;on propounded &s;hall be received to our Communion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[XI.]</HEAD>
<P>If ever any of our Communion &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to fall into any &s;candalous Sin (which God by his Grace prevent) we profe&s;s all dutiful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e Cen&s;ures, which the Scripture directs, and the Churches here practice.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="article">
<PB N="3" REF="2">
<HEAD>[XII.]</HEAD>
<P>Fora&s;much as the &s;ame power that <HI>Admits,</HI> &s;hould al&s;o <HI>Euclude,</HI> We judge it rea&s;onable, that the Pa&s;tor in Su&s;pending or Excommunicating an Offender, have the con&s;ent and concurrence of the Brethren.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[XIII.]</HEAD>
<P>We apprehend that a particular Church, as &s;uch, is a Society of Chri&s;tians by mutual agreement, u&s;ually meeting together for Publick Wor&s;hip in the &s;ame place, and under the &s;ame Mini&s;try, attending on the Ordinances of God there.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[XIV.]</HEAD>
<P>In every &s;uch Society, the Law of nature dictates to us, that there is implied a mutual promi&s;e and engagement of being faithful to the Relations they bear to each other, whither as private Chri&s;tians, or as Pa&s;tor and Flock, &s;o long as the Providence of God continues them in tho&s;e Relations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[XV.]</HEAD>
<P>We moreover Declare our &s;elves for Communion of Churches, freely allow|ing our Members occa&s;ionally to Communicate with other Churches of Chri&s;t, and receiving theirs occa&s;ionally to the Table of the Lord with us. And in extraordinary ca&s;es, when the Providence of God makes it needful, we conceive that any Authorized Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, may upon our reque&s;t, Admini&s;ter the Sacraments unto us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>[XVI.]</HEAD>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> We cannot confine the right of chu&s;ing a Mini&s;ter to the Male Communicant; alone, but we think that every Baptized Adult Per&s;on who contributes to the Maintenance, &s;hould have a Vote in Electing.</P>
<P>Yet it &s;eems but ju&s;t, that per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Piety, Gravity, Wi&s;dom, Authority or other Endowments, &s;hould be leading and Influential to the So|ciety in that Affair.</P>
<P>THESE are the Principles we Profe&s;s, and the Rules we purpo&s;e through the Grace of GOD, to govern our &s;elves by; and in &s;ome of the&s;e particulars only, and in no other, do we &s;ee cau&s;e to depart from what is ordinarily Profe&s;&s;ed and Practi&s;ed by the Churches of CHRIST here in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
