<P>THou art here pre&s;ented with The Pre&s;ent Pro|&s;pect of the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI>
about forty Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but far excelling that I&s;land, and indeed
any other of the Caribee-I&s;lands, in the Fertility and Richne&s;s of the Soil, and in the
Commodiou&s;ne&s;s of its Bays and Harbors: And it is no Paradox to affirm, That though it lies
<HI>more South,</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> is as <HI>Cool</HI> and <HI>Refre&s;hing</HI> as that of
<HI>Barba|does:</HI> and yet Exempted from tho&s;e affrighting and de&s;tructive
<HI>Hurricanes</HI> that have been often Fatal to the re&s;t of the <HI>Caribee</HI>-I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Nor is it unfurni&s;hed with any thing nece&s;&s;ary for the Su&s;tenance and Pre&s;ervation of
Humane Life; as you will &s;ee by the En&s;uing Pro&s;pect of it, in which there is nothing &s;et
down but what will be atte&s;ted by &s;everal that have been upon the I&s;land, and what thou wilt
find there, if Providence &s;hould bring thee thither: For there is variety enough of the real
Products of the I&s;land to di|late upon, without Interlarding it with fictitious Stories:</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>And I am per&s;waded there is no I&s;land in <HI>America,</HI> that can afford us more ample
Subjects to contemplate the Bounty and Goodne&s;s of our Great Creator in, than this of
<HI>Tobago;</HI> And this I &s;peak not by hear&s;ay, or as one that has liv'd always at home; but
as one that has had Experience of the World, and been in the greate&s;t Part of the
<HI>Caribee</HI>-I&s;lands, and mo&s;t parts of the Conti|nent of <HI>America,</HI> and almo&s;t
all his Maje&s;ties For|reign Plantations; and after having view'd them all, have cho&s;en this
I&s;land of <HI>Tobago</HI> to take up my <HI>Qui|etus e&s;t</HI> in.</P>
<P>To which end I have purcha&s;ed a Grant from the Duke of <HI>Courland</HI> (to whom by vertue of
an Agree|ment with His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the &s;aid Island does
&s;olely belong) of <HI>120000</HI> Acres of the &s;aid Island for my &s;elf and Company, upon very
Advan|tagious Conditions, for which I refer thee to the Propo&s;als at the end of the Book; and to
the Grant it &s;elf, in my own Cu&s;tody; Being very willing to give all rea&s;onable Satisfaction

<HEAD><HI>The Pre&s;ent Pro&s;pect OF TOBAGO: WITH</HI> A De&s;cription of the Situation,
Fertility, Growth and Manufacture of that I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I de&s;ign only to de&s;cribe the Flou|ri&s;hing I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> &s;o I
re|&s;olve by the Methods I have taken, not to build the <HI>Porch</HI> too big for the
<HI>Hou&s;e:</HI> For that end let this &s;mall Introduction admit you to a Pro&s;pect of
<HI>Tobago,</HI> which is a Sub|ject that needs no Encomium to il|lu&s;trate &s;o fertile a Soil as
de&s;ervedly may &s;peak her own Prai&s;e, becau&s;e con&s;ented to by mo&s;t that have known her,
to vye with the Glory of all the <HI>Caribes:</HI> So that I approve it convenient &s;he be heard
to &s;peak, and in her own Dialect too; then upon Exa|min by tho&s;e that con&s;ult her, &s;he'll
be found to evince the Incredulous beyond &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>And &s;ince in the Fronti&s;piece I have promi&s;ed to in|troduct
<PB N="2" REF="4">you to the Situation of the I&s;land, I do it by telling you that it lies in
Eleven Degrees Thirty Mi|nutes North-Latitude, and in Fifty Three Degrees Six Minutes Longitude,
We&s;t from the <HI>Lizard;</HI> and about Forty Leagues di&s;tant from the flouri&s;hing
<HI>Barbados,</HI> as Captain <HI>Lloyd</HI> a&s;&s;erts in his Breviat; who al&s;o affirms it the
mo&s;t Convenient, Commodious, and Salubrious I&s;land in the <HI>Caribes;</HI> and truly &s;o it
may, being &s;o &s;weet|ly tempered with tho&s;e moderate and Soveraign Breezes of Wind that
refre&s;h the Planter by Day, and purges the Air by Night: So that the Day-Breez &s;prings by
fa|vour from the Ocean, and ri&s;es with the Sun, as does the Night-Breez refre&s;h by &s;ofter
Gales, &s;ent from her Rocks and Mountanous Elevations. Nor is the rage of a Tempe&s;t at any time
heard to dread the Inhabitants, nor the terror of a Hurricane ever known to invade them; which of
all things is mo&s;t dreadful, and con|&s;equently mo&s;t fatal, to the re&s;t of the
<HI>Caribes;</HI> this be|ing the Southermo&s;t I&s;land (and neare&s;t to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Coa&s;t) which no Hurricane has hitherto invaded, as ever was heard of by any of the Inhabitants.
How|ever it exceeds not Thirty two miles in Length, and I &s;hould err to &s;ay more then Eleven in
Breadth; which di&s;proportion is &s;ufficiently recompenc'd by the Natu|ral Scituation of the Bays
and the Harbours for Shipping; as are the Rivers, Rivulets, &amp; larger Openings convenient for
Navigating of Sloops and &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, whereby to furni&s;h the Inhabitants, and commode
them for de&s;ence.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much therefore as by rea&s;on of her Fertility &s;he acquires to her &s;elf the Sirname of
<HI>Fortunate,</HI> except otherwi&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;uper&s;cribe her Unfortunate, when,
becau&s;e to involve them in her Redolent Em|bracements, or to invite forreign Princes to emulate
their Pro&s;perity: However at pre&s;ent &s;he lives in peace,
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y">and to out-live her troubles, and by the Provi|dence of God &s;leeps in
the Arms of Security; who&s;e Soil is &s;o rich without Art or Cultivation, that &s;ome have
fancied her the <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Indies;</HI> dre&s;t up in a beauteous Complexion of
Soil, that repre&s;ents in &s;ome parts a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Redne&s;s, whil&s;t to admiration in
other places it &s;hines with Blackne&s;s; and becau&s;e min|gled for the mo&s;t part with a Marley
Sub&s;tance, pene|trates the Earth a con&s;iderable depth; which evidently proves by convincing
Argument, the prodigious growth of her ma&s;&s;y and ponderous Timber-Trees, of which we &s;hall
&s;peak in their proper Cla&s;&s;is; as al&s;o of the Natural Plenty and Produce of Provi&s;ion,
the Delicacy of Fruits, and the Soveraign Vertue of Roots, Herbs, Flowers, and Medicinal Drugs;
be&s;ides Natures Boun|ty in Variety of Bea&s;ts, and Heavens Benediction in the multiplication of
Fi&s;h and Fowl, that abound both in fre&s;h and in &s;alt Water; which becau&s;e of another
Or|der, will the rather admit of a di&s;tinct Di&s;cour&s;e: So the Staple of the I&s;land, and the
Natural Product, will give us an occa&s;ion to offer it &s;omewhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Planters and the Inhabitants pre&s;ent a new Pro&s;pect; who&s;e Charge will be much
le&s;&s;ned to tho&s;e that live Northwardly, by rea&s;on of a warm yet tempe|rate Heat, becau&s;e
moderated by a continued Breez of Wind; So that here's no Summer &s;pent on purpo&s;e to accumulate
or heap up Provi&s;ion for Winters Accom|modation; becau&s;e all the year long both Herbage and
Fruits &s;prout and bud up by a perpetual Spring; and the Warmth in it &s;elf &s;o natural to
nouri&s;h Age, as is the Germinating (or budding) Spring to give encou|ragement to Youth. And the
I&s;land is &s;o repleni&s;h'd with materials for Building, that provided you bring dextrous Hands
and good Artificers, you may in a lit|tle
<PB N="4" REF="5">Time, and with &s;inall Charge, build both Hou&s;es and Towns, or
Fortifications.</P>
<P>The next thing to con&s;ult is, The Growth and Ma|nufacture of the Countrey, improvable by
Indu&s;try, and the Mediums of Art; which will fall in cour&s;e at the Opening of Individuals; &s;o
that we may proceed to the &s;everal particulars, referring the Reader for &s;atis|faction to the
Propo&s;als, if de&s;irous to con&s;ult the Grant, Government, Religion, Liberty of Con&s;cience,
the Settlement, In&s;urance, Accommodation, Factories, Shipping, and Encouragement for
Tran&s;portation; which is fully expre&s;t, without Fraud or Ambiguity.</P>
<DIV2 N="grain" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of GRAIN.</HEAD>
<P>FIr&s;t therefore let us begin with <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> which is either &s;uch as grows in
<HI>Virginia, New-York, Caro|lina,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o proceed to <HI>Guiney-Corn,</HI> or any
other that hath growth in the I&s;land. But I &s;hall delude you if to tell you that <HI>Engli&s;h
Grain</HI> grows here: However there are Engli&s;h Pea&s;e, and of various &s;orts; and Beans, and
Pul&s;e enough, as you may ob&s;erve if you plea&s;e, by the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian-Corn</HI> buds, and grows out with a &s;mall &s;tem upon a &s;trong &s;talk,
(which &s;talk they burn in <HI>Barbados</HI> under their Coppers in Crop-time, to boil up their
Sugar) and has a fibrous or &s;tringy Root; &s;ome of it brings one Ear, &s;ome two, and &s;ome
others three: But the green Leaves in mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribe</HI> I&s;les, they fre|quently
&s;trip off, and give them to their Cattel. Of this &s;ort of Corn, you may expect at lea&s;t two,
if not three Crops yearly, to a very great Increa&s;e; whereof
<PB N="5" REF="5">very good Bread is made; and with indifferent Art, a mo&s;t delicate Drink.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guiney-Corn</HI> is much of the figure and the nature of <HI>Rice;</HI> &s;ave onely
<HI>Rice</HI> has a &s;lender &s;talk, and a &s;mal|ler Ear, and grows in Swamps and moi&s;t
Bottoms; but this will grow on the Tops of Rocks, and produce its Increa&s;e upon any Soil. The
&s;talk is &s;trong, very large and tall; and the Corn &s;prouts forth on the top, or ex|treame&s;t
part of the &s;talk, (it has a fibrous Root) and augments to a prodigious increa&s;e; for one Grain
by natural Product, without the Art of Cultivation, mul|tiplies of it &s;elf into many thou&s;ands.
Of this they make Bread, Dumplins, and Puddings; and &s;ome hull it like <HI>Rice,</HI> and boil it
with Milk.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bonivis</HI> repre&s;ents the &s;hape of a Pea, &s;ave only its &s;ome what longer;
which if once put into the ground, the Art of Man can hardly de&s;troy it; for it &s;eldom dies,
but continually buds, and blo&s;&s;oms, ac|commodating the Planter with green, and ripe Pea&s;e all
the year about. Nor think I them inferiour to the be&s;t of <HI>French Beans,</HI> if indifferently
boiled, and eaten with &s;weet Butter; but then it mu&s;t be while they are green and tender; for
when they are ripe, their Ca&s;e or Rind turns white; which if dried, and as other Pul&s;e boiled,
are eaten with Pork, and are a Nouri&s;hing Food.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>French Pea,</HI> &s;o much admired in <HI>Martinego;</HI> I confe&s;s it a
whole&s;ome and &s;trengthen|ing Food, both for Native and Planter; which al&s;o thrives to a
prodigious increa&s;e, and bears without in|terruption all the year about.</P>
<P>So of the <HI>Jamaica</HI> (or the five weeks Pea) by &s;lender Art or Indu&s;try you can never
want them; and he that wants them not, has always &s;omething that's good and whole&s;ome to &s;eed
on. But as Idlene&s;s is the Darling
<PB N="6" REF="6">of Ea&s;e, &s;o through a vain Remi&s;ne&s;s &s;ome &s;lide into Poverty.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o the <HI>Kidney-Pea,</HI> and the <HI>Black-ey'd-Pea,</HI> much of one nature and
vertual property; and be|cau&s;e of its figure, formation, and likene&s;s to the
<HI>Kid|ney-Bean,</HI> have almo&s;t to &s;uper&s;tition made &s;ome fancy it a Specifick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pidgeon-Pea</HI> grows here al&s;o, and is a plea&s;ant Food; but they mu&s;t be
gathered whil&s;t as yet they are young, and eaten with &s;weet Butter whil&s;t their Buds are
tender.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>French-Bean</HI> (of a very large &s;ize) which, if eaten with &s;weet
Butter and Bacon, makes a Harmony in the Stomach. Be&s;ides &s;everal other vari|ous and curious
&s;orts of Pul&s;e this I&s;land produceth, to the admiration of all men: So that if Summer Grain
be &s;o happy to fall into that fertile Soil, it never mi&s;&s;eth of a generous increa&s;e.
Moreover, here are all manner of Pul&s;e, as if naturally &s;trewed up and down the Coun|trey; and
which al&s;o &s;prings up all the year about: So that People need not to be tempted into the
con&s;idera|tion of Starving, except through Ob&s;tinacy, or a vain Neglect, or degenerating from
Mankind, they offer an Unnatural Violence to Them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I remember the wonderful pre&s;ervation of <HI>Otto Eden,</HI> (a Dutchman) that &s;led in a
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Surinam,</HI> to pre&s;erve him&s;elf and Family; which by Gods
Pro|vidence were miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved in this Fortunate I&s;land of <HI>Tobago;</HI> but a
Stranger on the place, and be|cau&s;e having no Bread to eat, and his half-fami&s;h'd Children
lamenting about him, it &s;truck him into a deep Melancholy: So that whiles under a heavy
pre&s;&s;ure of mind, and con&s;idering what to do, a Prote&s;tant-<HI>Indian</HI> that fled along
with him, asked Mr. <HI>Eden, Why out of
<PB N="7" REF="6">mea&s;ure &s;o &s;orrowful?</HI> Mr. <HI>Eden</HI> replies, <HI>I that have fed
&s;o many &s;cores of People, have not at pre&s;ent where withal to eat:</HI> To which the
<HI>Indian</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>That God that gave you Pre&s;ervation, has brought you into a Land
of Plenty; De&s;pair not, Mr.</HI> Eden; <HI>Furni&s;h me with a Ne|gro or two, and a couple of
Axes, and I'll &s;uddenly bring you &s;ome Provi&s;ion to eat:</HI> Which was pre&s;ently
perfor|med by &s;triking down a large <HI>Macaw</HI> Tree (about the bigne&s;s of a mans middle)
and of the whiti&s;h pithy &s;ub&s;tance near to the Top, he beats in a Mortar, then pre&s;&s;ed
out the Juyce, and boiled it to the con&s;i&s;tency of a Ha&s;ty-Pudding: But the re&s;idue he
dried, and rub'd to a perfect Flower; which with nothing el&s;e but fair Water only, he moulds into
Cakes; of which like Bread I eat at my arrival in <HI>Tobago,</HI> at the &s;ame <HI>Eden</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, and did verily per&s;wade my &s;elf (before I heard this Relation) that it was Dutch
Wheaten Bisket.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="fruit" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of FR&V;IT.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now entred upon the Cla&s;&s;is of <HI>Fruits,</HI> and &s;hal fir&s;t begin with the
<HI>Cu&s;hen Apple,</HI> which is meat and drink; only made di&s;tingui&s;hable by the Art of
boyling, who&s;e Nuts if pre&s;erv'd you may eat, and of the Rind whiles green make an excellent
Lamp Oyl, which by &s;mall Artifice is ea&s;ily obtainable.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Bmano</HI> is a fruit of that &s;ingular Admiration that the Super&s;titious
<HI>Papist</HI> dur&s;t not cut it with a Kni&s;e; le&s;t de&s;ponding with him&s;elf he divide the
Cro&s;s. This Fruit al&s;o may be eaten raw, or bettered by an ea&s;y Decoction of Fire.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>Here is al&s;o the <HI>Figg-Tree,</HI> &s;uch as is that in <HI>Spain,</HI> and
<HI>Portugal,</HI> and &s;everal parts in <HI>America;</HI> which Fruit may be eaten while as yet
its ripe; or expo&s;ed to better Husbandry, it &s;erves for good Drink.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Prickle-Apple,</HI> of a &s;harp brisk ta&s;te; (and an <HI>Indian</HI>
expedient again&s;t the <HI>Bloody-Flux</HI>) it makes a brave <HI>Marmalade:</HI> and helps for
&s;taining and colouring any thing. But the <HI>Prickle-Pear,</HI> to &s;peak its due prai&s;e, is
one of the mo&s;t Soveraign Fruits in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pome-granate,</HI> is a Fruit of that &s;ingular Eminen|cy, as hardly to be expre&s;t,
without a Scriptural Phra&s;e: They are plentiful here, a Re&s;tringent and Cooler; Con&s;ulted by
the Natives in Fevers, and Fluxes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pine-Apple,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s is a Fruit of that Ex|cellency, that I want
Rhetorick and Oratory to expre&s;s it. Some bears a Crown, and is the King of Fruits; but to them
with three Crowns, the Idolatrous pay their Super&s;titions, The Fruit of it &s;elf is of Fruit
mo&s;t delicious, and the Liquor botled up, makes an admira|ble Drink.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o <HI>Pum-Citrons,</HI> that make an excellent l're&s;erve.</P>
<P>But of <HI>Oranges</HI> here are three &s;orts; The &s;ower for &s;auce, and the Flowers for
E&s;&s;ences, the &s;weet ones are eaten for Reereation. But the <HI>China-Orange</HI> that grows
here in <HI>America,</HI> &s;uper-excels tho&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI> be|yond expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Lemons</HI> al&s;o, here are two &s;everal &s;orts; the &s;ower one, for
<HI>Lemanadoes;</HI> and the &s;weet one for Delectation. So of Limes al&s;o, here are &s;weet and
&s;ower: with the la&s;t of which, they make Limeads and Punch.</P>
<P><HI>Guavers</HI> are a Fruit that's very &s;tony, there's the white and the Red; but they differ
in Virtue: and if baked
<PB N="9" REF="7">or boyled green, are either of them Specificks again&s;t immoderate Purgations.
Moreover if you weed, or pick out the &s;tones; you have then a ba&s;is for Marmalade, to equalize
Quinces.</P>
<P><HI>Tamerinds,</HI> grow here by natural in&s;tinct; they'r a delicate fruit, and vertual in
Feavers.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Planton</HI> of all fruits, the <HI>Nigros</HI> love be&s;t; and is a nouri&s;hing
Soveraign whole&s;ome food. Some eat them raw when Nature has ripned them; and &s;ome a|gain
roa&s;t them before they be ripe. Some eat them green, and &s;ome take and boyl them, and
other&s;ome eat them as often as they get them. Now to roa&s;t them they are bread, and to boyl
them they are &s;awce; or Marmelade may be made: but to barbacue or dry them in the Sun you may rub
them to a Flower.</P>
<P>Here are Grapes great &s;tore, but are eaten off the Clu&s;tre; for the Planter has another
Pro&s;pect more pro|fitable than Wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cu&s;tard Apple,</HI> to my ta&s;te I mu&s;t confe&s;s is very delightful.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Sower Sop,</HI> a mediocrity of nouri&s;h|ment: to &s;ome its meat, when to
other&s;ome drink.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Papaw-Apple,</HI> which to my liking is very grateful, and apetizing when &s;haped
into &s;awce, by boyling it with Salt-beef: and if &s;o happy to mingle it with &s;weet and fre&s;h
Butter: except the <HI>Squa&s;h,</HI> there's nothing beyond it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mamme Apple</HI> grows to the Magnitude of a Pound Pear, its of a yellow colour, and
eats like Marmalade. Then there's the Mamme Supporter, much of the &s;ame Nature with the former,
&s;ave only the la&s;t has two &s;tones, and the fir&s;t as in order is indewed but with one.</P>
<P>The <HI>Yellow-plum,</HI> grows every where here, and is of
<PB N="10" REF="8">Plums a mo&s;t Lu&s;cious Food. But then there's more cry then wool, for what
with the greatne&s;s of the Stone and the thickne&s;s of the external rind, the fruit can
&s;carcely get a Habitation betwixt them.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Cherry-trees</HI> al&s;o, (which bear the year a|bout) who&s;e fruit is &s;omewhat
of a &s;harpi&s;h ta&s;te; then there's the Cherry which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> calls
<HI>Purgas,</HI> which, when throughly ripe, are mellifluous and &s;weet, of a cooling and opening
Nature, which if pre&s;erv'd would be a Rariety for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Cocur-Nut-tree,</HI> and the fruit that hangs up|on it, the <HI>Indians</HI> idolize
it, and call it Gods-tree: be|cau&s;e to produce both meat, drink, and Cloth: its true beyond
di&s;pute, that the Nut of it &s;elf is a &s;weet be|yond the &s;weete&s;t <HI>Almond;</HI> and the
Liquor that lodgeth in the bo&s;om of this fruit, is to my liking beyond <HI>Flo|rens</HI> at
<HI>Frontiniack:</HI> but the Shell &s;erves for Cups, Spoons, and Di&s;hes; and the Rind
encompa&s;&s;ing the Shell, &s;erves the <HI>Indians</HI> for covering, and with the Leaves they
thatch their Hou&s;es, and make Baskets, but &s;ome more ingenious make Ropes, and Lines for
<HI>Fishing.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>Maccaw-Nut</HI> Shell, the <HI>Indians</HI> make the boles of their <HI>Tobacco</HI>
pipes; the kernel is eatable, Yet not very admirable; but the Nut of it &s;elf makes an excel|lent
Lamp-Oyl.</P>

<HEAD>Of Fle&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>ANd now we pre&s;ent you with the Cla&s;is of <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> give me leave therefore in the
fir&s;t place to begin with the <HI>Wild-Hogg,</HI> of which &s;ort of Cattle their num|bers are
innumerable; when yearly the people cut off at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and, and yet they increa&s;e
&s;oprodigi|ou&s;ly fa&s;t, that neither Gun, nor Engin, nor any other Ar|tifice can be found to
de&s;troy them. It's truth beyond &s;u&s;|pition that the <HI>Barbadians</HI> kill &s;ome of them;
but the re&s;t of the <HI>Caribes</HI> and others are daily vi&s;itants; who to &s;ave it for
tran&s;portation, or pre&s;erve it for their own accom|modation, commonly Jerk, and dry &s;alt it
in the Sun, or in Bulk or Pickle. But here you are to con&s;ider in the de&s;cription of Fle&s;h, I
onely touch upon the natural produce of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pickery</HI> is a Bea&s;t much re&s;embling a Hogg, &s;ave onely he draws his Breath at
his ventricle; which for the mo&s;t part concentrates on the middle of his Back; which Creature by
ob&s;ervation is &s;wifter of foot than the Hog is; But then his Fle&s;h is leaner, and reli&s;hes
more of Veni&s;on then of Pork; and is taken with more diffi|culty then u&s;ually Hogs are;
becau&s;e &s;wifter of Foot,
<PB N="14" REF="10">and many times endangers the Doggs that attempt him. So that he's &s;eldom
de&s;troyed without Gun, or Dart, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive largne&s;s of his tusks that
branch them&s;elves upwards, as al&s;o downwards: yet as formidable as he pre&s;ents him&s;elf to
the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome men, hitherto none has known him to &s;et up|on a man.</P>
<P>Then here's great quantities of the <HI>Armidillas</HI> (which the <HI>Hollander</HI> calls
<HI>Tattoos</HI>) that are Arm'd with Armour on their Backs; and the large&s;t among&s;t them but
of an indifferent &s;ize, &s;eldom exceeding one foot in height. They are a Creature that generally
feeds upon Fruits, and Roots: and when roa&s;ted have the natural ta&s;te of a Pigg, but then the
Fle&s;h is much more Phy&s;ical; as if Nature had made it a Specifick for a Surfeit.</P>
<P>Moreover, for accomodating <HI>Hor&s;es, Cows, A&s;s-Ne|goes, Sheep, Deer, Hoggs, Goats,
Rawbits, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;hould lame my De&s;cription, and unworthily conceal the plenty of a
Countrey that repre&s;ents to every one the bounty of Nature by Heavens genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>In this I&s;land you will meet with two &s;orts of <HI>Guanos;</HI> the one of a green, but the
other of a grey colour, which is &s;haped like a <HI>Lizard,</HI> &s;omewhat re&s;embling the
<HI>Alle|gator.</HI> I have &s;een &s;ome of tho&s;e Creatures four and five foot in length: they
live upon Herbs, In&s;ects and Fruits; and burrow like a Coney in the hollow Pits in &s;and. The
<HI>Indians</HI> extol them for Food, but the green <HI>Guano</HI> is a more delicate, and
nutricious meat; who lives only by eating of Fruits and Flies; nor is he all out &s;o bigg as the
gray one (re&s;embling the Creature we call the Ca|melion) he lodgeth upon Trees, not in Cavities
of Rocks, nor will he &s;oil him&s;elf in marley Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Coney is a delicate Creature, much big|ener, much taller, and larger than
ours are. Their meat
<PB N="15" REF="10">is plea&s;ant, whol&s;ome, and delicious. And their Skins aromatically &s;mell
of Musk; which occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;trangers to call them Musk Squirrils (or &s;weet Rats, though
&s;omewhat improper) however their Skins are a good &s;ort of Furr, and the rather becau&s;e of
their natu|ral Perfume.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Apo&s;&s;um,</HI> another &s;ort of a Crea|ture, who is in re&s;emblance
much of the ca&s;t and figure of our <HI>Engli&s;h Badger</HI> (but his Leggs are equal) and the
mo&s;t of any thing a&s;&s;imulates the <HI>Racone,</HI> and naturally becau&s;e &s;o affected with
mankind in general, that he follows him, comes to him, and delights to gaze on him. So that by
indu&s;try and an ea&s;y arti|fice, there's but little difficulty to make him tame: However the

ground, whiles the larger contents him|&s;elf in low and moi&s;t bottoms: &s;ome &s;ort of people
eat them, and commend their food for good Diet; &s;ome of them are bigger, and &s;ome le&s;s: but
the weightie&s;t to my Ob&s;ervation exceeded not thirty pound.</P>
<P>Here in the I&s;land are three &s;orts of Land-Crabbs <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Red, the black, and
the white Crab; but the Red of him&s;elf is naturally &s;o, becau&s;e Nature adorns him with more
Beauty externally, then internally &s;he
<PB N="16" REF="11">inriches him with Aliment and Nutrition. Yet &s;ome have fancyed them very good
food, and highly applaud them; but this &s;ort of Crab loves a rockey, and dry Land; who &s;eldom
or rarely con&s;ults the Water.</P>
<P>The next in order we call the black Crab, from which the blew Crab differs but a little; they
are both good food, yet their exce&s;s breeds Fluxes; the one &s;torms the Hills becau&s;e high
minded, but the other more Sub|mi&s;&s;ive contents him&s;elf in Dales.</P>
<P>Then there's the White Crab (larger then the re&s;t) that generally lives in &s;wamps, and miery
places: I know not what they feed on, but are of them&s;elves mo&s;t delicious food. Of this &s;ort
the Carbs becau&s;e &s;o nume|rous the Lazy <HI>Indian</HI> wont leave his <HI>Hamacca</HI> to
catch them; except in rainy Weather, when they creep into their hou&s;es; it may be then they'l
take &s;o much pains as to &s;tretch forth an arm to fling them into the fire; &s;o roa&s;t and eat
them. The&s;e Crabs we call Delvers, becau&s;e of their Undermining.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame Cla&s;&s;is is the <HI>Land Shell Souldier</HI> who&s;e Claws re&s;emble the Claws
of a Crab, but is of him&s;elf a very little Creature; &s;ome &s;ay they are eatable, but I Warrant

<P>ANd now I am got into the Cla&s;&s;is of Fi&s;h, I &s;hall offer you a pre&s;ent of the
<HI>Groper</HI> fir&s;t, becau&s;e he's a Fi&s;h generally much bigger than the
<PB N="17" REF="11"><HI>Salmon;</HI> who&s;e Head &s;uper-excels the head of a <HI>Cod</HI> for
goodne&s;s; but an Angler may di&s;tingui&s;h Salt-water-fi&s;h from <HI>Salmon.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Grooper,</HI> we bring you the grey <HI>Porgo;</HI> who though in Stature and
figure &s;eems a le&s;&s;er fi&s;h, yet is he nothing inferiour for delicate food. Then there's the
Red <HI>Porgo,</HI> of a faint pinck-colour, and &s;caled like the Grey, as is the Grey like the
<HI>Grooper;</HI> this fi&s;h of fi&s;h is the Fi&s;hermans charm, and every mans purcha&s;e,
who&s;e hook and line may ea&s;ily reach him.</P>
<P>But there are two &s;orts of <HI>Cavallas,</HI> the Green and the Grey; the la&s;t we call
<HI>Hou&s;e-eye,</HI> of the &s;ize of a <HI>Sal|mon,</HI> and &s;caled much alike. But the Green
<HI>Cavalla</HI> is le&s;s than a <HI>Grooper,</HI> and is infinitely prefer'd before the Grey for
delicacy of ta&s;te; more excellent food, and much more Nutritious.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Mullet</HI> here are plenty; &s;ome bigger, and &s;ome le&s;s: from the &s;ize of a
<HI>Mackerel,</HI> to the extent of a <HI>Pickerel.</HI> This fi&s;h I prefer for its delicacy of
food, and by an ingenious arti&s;t makes excellent Scaveche.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Sea-chub</HI> in <HI>Tobago</HI> is a fi&s;h of that excellency, that any ways
dre&s;t is a food extraordinary; but then he mu&s;t be fre&s;h and bleeding new; otherwi&s;e he
nei|ther affords good food, nor will he make but indifferent Phy&s;ick, this fi&s;h of all fi&s;h
makes the royal <HI>Scaveche,</HI> as the Row of the <HI>Mullet</HI> makes the be&s;t
<HI>Buttargo.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Manatee</HI> or <HI>Sea-cow,</HI> is of an Amphibious Nature, that eats gra&s;s like an
Ox, and &s;wims like an <HI>Otter:</HI> that lives &s;ometimes under Water, and grows to a
prodigious greatne&s;s; for &s;ome of them have weighed ten and twelve hundred pound weight; they
are &s;truck with Harping Irons, or other Engines, and &s;o taken, who&s;e fle&s;h of fi&s;h
nece&s;&s;ity only extols it; but the skin if well managed, makes a kind of Bendleather; and
<PB N="18" REF="12">the ill Management thereof is when they Manatee the poor <HI>Nigros,</HI> with
&s;traps made thereof.</P>
<P>Of the fi&s;h called <HI>Turtle,</HI> there are various &s;orts; the <HI>Hawks-bill,</HI> the
<HI>Vandoras,</HI> the <HI>Logerhead,</HI> and the green <HI>Turtle;</HI> which the Native
<HI>Indian</HI> out of a &s;trange admi|ration, have to a degree of Super&s;tition thought among
them&s;elves, that the la&s;t was &s;acred; for they call it Gods fi&s;h, by rea&s;on of the
extraordinary vertue that's found therein; as if compendiou&s;ly &s;um'd up to &s;erve all
<HI>America.</HI> And truly I can a&s;&s;ert it a Medicinal food, for it cured me of Poy&s;on; from
that intoxicated Palm-Wine that the <HI>Nigros</HI> gave me, when la&s;t in <HI>Guiney;</HI> which
Poy&s;on was expelled at the <HI>Caiamanos,</HI> about ten months after, by eating of
<HI>Turtle;</HI> but for the <HI>Gho|norea,</HI> the <HI>Yaws</HI> and the <HI>French-pox,</HI>
there is not in Na|ture a food more effectual. This rariety of a Creature has three large hearts
that hang together in one &s;tring; and as the <HI>Manattee</HI> is, &s;o is &s;he, an Amphibion
that lives in the Water, and without it; that &s;wims like a fi&s;h, yet in the Sand lays Eggs like
a Fowl; who&s;e fi&s;h is fle&s;h, and admits of various ta&s;tes; as of Veal, of Beef, but the fat
is green, and eats like Marrow; and their Eggs undi&s;tingui&s;hable from tho&s;e of a Hen; which
if pickled, &s;trung up, and barbacued in the Sun, are little or nothing inferiour to
<HI>Buttargo.</HI> And though notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Vandoras Turtle</HI> a&s;&s;imilates &s;ome
what the Nature of the Green, yet is her fat not by half &s;o &s;weet; and is of a more yellowi&s;h
Complexion. But the <HI>Hawks-bill</HI> is &s;maller, and not &s;o Soveraign; but then it excels
the former in Sub&s;tance, for our <HI>Tortois</HI> Combs are &s;haped from that &s;hall: who
al&s;o lays her Eggs in the Sand as the re&s;t do. But the <HI>Logerhead,</HI> becau&s;e larger in
the front then his Fellows, &s;hews more bulkey, and is a bigger fi&s;h. Now we
<PB N="19" REF="12">propound you three ways to take them; either by fools, which are &s;haped into
Netts: or by a &s;trong prong of Iron, fa&s;tned to a Pole; or otherwi&s;e by turning of their
<HI>Calopeia</HI> upwards. The&s;e are the u&s;ual ways we take them, and their plenty is &s;uch in
this I&s;land of <HI>To|bago,</HI> that one nights work may &s;upply a thou&s;and peo|ple with food
for more than twice twenty four hours.</P>
<P>The next that pre&s;ents in order, is the <HI>Barracooto,</HI> and they are of two forts, and
&s;ome about two foot in length, they have a long beak, or &s;nout, filled full of Teeth: which
when you would &s;urpri&s;e them by a hook, and line, be &s;ure you arm well with wier, for at
lea&s;t two foot in length. The white mouth'd <HI>Barracooto</HI> is the whol&s;ome&s;t Fi&s;h; for
the black mouth'd Fi&s;h his Teeth are venemous, and the fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, e&s;pecially near
the Back bone.</P>
<P>Then there's the great <HI>Garr,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> calls <HI>Needle Fi&s;h,</HI>
about &s;ome two foot long; who&s;e bill is &s;haped like a <HI>Snite,</HI> good and whol&s;om
Diet. But the &s;maller <HI>Garr-fi&s;h,</HI> which al&s;o has a long beak, and &s;el|dom exceeds
twelve inches in length; if by an Arti&s;t dre&s;t and fried with fre&s;h Butter, its difficult to
di&s;tingui&s;h his ta&s;te from a <HI>Smelt.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pilchard</HI> we have al&s;o here (but then its &s;maller then ours in <HI>England</HI>)
which ru&s;h into the Bays for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, when cha&s;ed or pur&s;ued by a Ma&s;ter
Fi&s;h: So that &s;ometimes part of their Shoals are forced a Shoar, and taken up by ca&s;ting Nets
(and others) in very great quantities. But the <HI>Pilchards</HI> in <HI>Barbados</HI> are
feavouri&s;h &s;ome months in the year.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o we have a Fi&s;h which we call an <HI>Anchovy,</HI> much &s;maller than a
<HI>Pilchard,</HI> and of an <HI>Anchovy</HI> &s;hape; which if taken in &s;ea&s;on, and pickled by
Art, may for
<PB N="20" REF="13">ought I know, vye with tho&s;e from Forreign Part</P>
<P>The <HI>Hedg-hogg</HI> Fi&s;h we have here al&s;o, that are arm'd with prodigious &s;trong
Prickles: which in bigne&s;s and largne&s;s exceed the Land <HI>&V;rchin.</HI> Some have eaten
them, and &s;ay they are very good food; But I rather ap|prove of their Oyl for Aches.</P>
<P>So of the <HI>Coney Fi&s;h,</HI> which is of a &s;maller &s;ize, that has purcha&s;ed his name
from the &s;hape of his mouth. He's a Fi&s;h as &s;eldom fed on as any Fi&s;h, but his Fle&s;h
drawn out and neatly &s;tuft, they &s;end them to <HI>England,</HI> and other Parts for
Rarities.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Indian Sturgeon</HI> (&s;o called by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) frequents the Bays, and
are &s;ome of them five or &s;ix foot in length. The Fi&s;h wants only the art of well cu|ring, to
pre&s;erve it for tran&s;portation into Remoter Parts. However if you eat him fre&s;h, you will
find him excellent Food: they are taken with the line, and &s;ometimes with Nets; but take them at
all times they are &s;eldom out of &s;ea&s;on. Now were there a Fi&s;hery erected in this I&s;land,
without di&s;pute it would turn to a very good accompt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphin</HI> is a Fi&s;h that gives cha&s;e to the flying Fi&s;h; which are numberle&s;s
here. But the <HI>Dolphin</HI> in his cha&s;e, &s;hines of a golden colour, when at other times (he
preys not) his Scales &s;hew like Silver. They are taken with the Hook, as we &s;ail round the
I&s;land; &s;ome of them two, or three foot long, and more. They are delicate food, and make a fine
Scaveche; which to admiration when their lives expire, they reflect a tin|cture of what pre&s;ents
unto them. By which we may perceive, that the privation of water (which is their natural Element)
cau&s;es an immediate Ce&s;&s;ation of the actions of life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flying fi&s;h</HI> is not all out &s;o bigg as a <HI>Herring,</HI> nor
<PB N="21" REF="13">by much &s;o boney, but is delicate food: which makes &s;e|veral
<HI>Fi&s;hes</HI> in the Sea prey upon him: who in a fre&s;h gale dilates his finns, which Nature
has lent him, as wings to fly with; &amp; which conveys him &s;ometimes half a furlong, or further.
So that dipping his wings again into the &s;alt Ocean, he readily prepares for another flight, and
mind|ful of the <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> per&s;uing after him, he flies into the chains or mid&s;hip of a
ve&s;&s;el: and &s;ometimes on the quar|ter Decks; as it happened to me in my pa&s;&s;age to
<HI>Bar|bados,</HI> that a flying Fi&s;h as I &s;at at the Table; &s;prung out of the Sea, and flew
into my Lap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Boneto</HI> likewi&s;e he prays upon flying Fi&s;h, and is taken with the Hook, though
&s;ometimes we &s;tick them with Fisgigs, which with &s;harpened &amp; barbed Prongs of Iron are
fa&s;tned to a Pole, having &s;ome Lead on the ex|treame&s;t part. Some of this kind are thirty
inches long; which boyled and eaten with fre&s;h Butter, and the juyce of a Lemmon, maks a Food
mo&s;t delicious.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Albacore</HI> that has the figure and &s;hape of a <HI>Bo|neto;</HI> yet is he
bigger, longer, and larger; much of the nature and reli&s;h of the <HI>Boneto;</HI> and preys on
the fly|ing Fi&s;h, as the <HI>Boneto</HI> does. By which you may con|clude, that the flying Fi&s;h
of all Fi&s;h is &s;urrounded with Enemies.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Amber Fi&s;h,</HI> an excellent Food; &s;o is the <HI>Angel Fi&s;h,</HI>
and the <HI>green Swallow</HI>-Tail; but the la&s;t is a Fi&s;h not much bigger than a
<HI>Herring:</HI> all of them take the hook, and if they like their commons di&s;pond not of death,
when to &s;acrifice their lives to the Angler.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parrot Fi&s;h</HI> who&s;e Scales &s;hine with green and yellow, his head re&s;embles
the head of a <HI>Parrot,</HI> let the delicacy of the Food prai&s;e it &s;elf. So of the

<P>The next <HI>Armado</HI> that in order approach us, are the Shell-Fi&s;h; for that end let us

<P>The <HI>Sea-&s;ouldier</HI> a&s;&s;imilates the <HI>Crab,</HI> by rea&s;on of the great and

an ob|&s;cure colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cunck</HI> is a Shell Fi&s;h, of which we have plenty, nor have I known a &s;weeter
Food; two boys in two hours may take enough for 500 men. This <HI>Fish</HI> may be boiled, &s;tewed

<P><HI>The Horn-fish,</HI> I have &s;een &s;ome of them ten inches long, and not unlike the
re&s;emblance of a <HI>Po&s;t-boys-horn:</HI> The Shell of this <HI>Fish</HI> is of a &s;ine
<HI>figure,</HI> and partly of a Pearl colour, but not very Orient; yet the meat very
excellent.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14">
<P>The <HI>Orney</HI> al&s;o is a &s;ort of <HI>Shell-fi&s;h,</HI> that &s;ticks and adheres to the

<P>So of the <HI>Scollop-fi&s;h,</HI> who&s;e &s;hell is as big as a &s;aucer, and partly

complain of your diet.</P>
<P><HI>Cockles</HI> grow here to the bigne&s;s of an Egg, but then there's an inferiour growth that
never arrive to that Maturity: both lye in Sand, but examin'd by the fire, and if you have no
aver&s;ion to fi&s;h, I'll pa&s;s my word you will find good food.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Sea-Snail,</HI> here are very great quantities: and &s;ome of them you will meet with
as big as your fi&s;t: they lye very thick, and clo&s;e together, on very Sholes and Rocks, and
&s;ometimes on banks that are almo&s;t dry: which without difficulty may be attempted, and taken at
low-water. Their Shells are of a curious Fi|gure to form Cups of: and as much as any fi&s;h
imitates the Oriental.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rock Oyster,</HI> adheres to the cliffs of the Rocks: the in&s;ide of who&s;e Shell is
of a &s;hining colour; his Li|quor bracki&s;h, and his fle&s;h good food. But that other
<HI>Oyster</HI> that produceth the Pearl, they lye in &s;ome four or five fathom Water, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> dive for, to obtain that trea&s;ure: but we think to examin a readier expedient,
if when once we come to have Dredges a|mong&s;t us.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Mangrove Oy&s;ter,</HI> that grows upon Trees on the tops of boughs, &amp; the

lick on the Surface of the water) which by natural in&s;tinct incline towards their roots By this
means the Oy&s;ters Clu&s;ter, and clung together about them: that not a bough is barren. Now
&s;ome folks eat them out of Curio&s;ity, but truly I cannot commend them for good food. Their
Shells partly Pearl colour, and almo&s;t tran&s;parent, and becau&s;e very thin and clear, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ub&s;titute them in lieu of Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sea-Egg</HI> is of two &s;orts: &s;ome black, and &s;ome grey. But either &s;ort are
guarded, and arm'd with Prickles. But the grey eggs are the Oy&s;ters, becau&s;e re|&s;embling them
in ta&s;te: and are eaten raw, with Vine|gar and Pepper; but better &s;tewed with Wine, and
Shellots, and &s;ometimes with a ca&s;t of <HI>East-India Spices;</HI> which &s;o ordered, I
confe&s;s, there's no richer food. So that you may read in the Compendions Catalogue, Some Fi&s;h

them for <HI>Food.</HI></P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Black-Bird,</HI> about the bigne&s;s of a <HI>Crow,</HI> which feeds on the
<HI>Berries</HI> that fall from the <HI>Palmeto;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15">who&s;e fle&s;h is nothing inferiour to a Pidgeon. But the &s;maller Black-bird

<P>The <HI>Booby</HI> &s;o called, is a bird over credulous; be|cau&s;e when to proffer him your

them you &s;hall &s;ee as big as a Capon, who&s;e Down is rich, beyond degrees of Compari&s;on; and
le&s;s than two ounces from each individual Bird, you need never doubt of, and their Numbers &s;o
numerous that in ten days time, and by ea&s;y Artifice, an ordinary man may procure ten

<P>The <HI>Blew headed Parrot,</HI> is a very pretty bird, but in largene&s;s he's &s;omewhat
inferiour to the Green: they may be taught to talk any dialect: becau&s;e naturally affect|ed with
the Vanity of tattle. Roa&s;t, or boyl them, you'l commend the Diet. So of the
<HI>Parraketoes,</HI> of which there are two &s;orts; one about the bigne&s;s of our <HI>En|gli&s;h
Thru&s;h,</HI> but plumed like a Parrot, and becau&s;e inclinable to prattle, the difficulty's the
le&s;s to learn them to &s;peak. But the &s;maller <HI>Paraketo</HI> exceeds not a Spar|row in
bigne&s;s; and like the green Parrot may be taught to talk, who&s;e fle&s;h is equivalent with that
of the Par|rot, &s;ave only you have not &s;o much at a meal. Then there's the <HI>Main
Parrot,</HI> who&s;e head is Yellow, and has a yellow bre&s;t: which to make him more beautiful
Nature has cloathed him though in green. This bird &s;peaks the be&s;t, and is more Docible then
the re&s;t; and if I mi&s;take not, is a rich food to feed on.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Macaw,</HI> that's headed like a Parrot, but his body in proportion is four
times bigger, who&s;e Feathers becau&s;e &s;haded with blews, reds, and green,
<PB N="26" REF="16">makes him &s;hine with lu&s;tre, &s;ince beautified with &s;uch e|minent

<P>But the <HI>Flamingo</HI> of all fowls is the faire&s;t; and as they generally fly in Covees
together, &s;o they frequent|ly feed in flocks together: who&s;e &s;tature is tall and upright;
equal to the height of a man. Some call them good food, but I a&s;&s;ert they have curious
Feathers, and of various colours. Truly to admiration when I have viewed this Creature, I have been
led into &s;peculation to Contemplate the Creation: who&s;e out&s;ide, becau&s;e mo&s;t beautiful,
interprets a more glorious in&s;ide. But to the <HI>Flamingo</HI> who&s;e wings are skin'd with a
glori|ous Pin-colour, inclinable to Scarlet: and becau&s;e, fring|ed and tipt with &s;ables: make
them &s;how rich, as to the Maje&s;ty of birds.</P>
<P><HI>Tobago</HI> al&s;o has a <HI>Duck</HI> which is delicate food: but then they are &s;maller
than ours in <HI>England;</HI> and dege|nerate as to &s;etting, for ours will &s;et all night on

<P>The <HI>Sea-gull</HI> is much of a Ca&s;t with tho&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> &s;omewhat larger

<P>And &s;o the <HI>Sea-mew</HI> is plentiful here, and much of the Nature with tho&s;e in
<HI>England:</HI> if different in any thing, their food eats better.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plover</HI> we have here, are of two di&s;tinct &s;orts, and are generally grey, but the

food, and delicious to feed on,</P>
<P>The <HI>Turtle-dove</HI> al&s;o admits of a double di&s;tinction, becau&s;e here are two

Flies that &s;wim on the &s;urface of the water, and that's his Food which Nature affords him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pelican</HI> is a Bird about the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e, that has a great head, and a
very large &s;wallow, and a Crop or Craw larger than other Birds. Some of our people has made Caps
of their Craws, which they wore to cover their heads. This Bird feeds upon <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> and has
him&s;elf a fi&s;hy ta&s;te; but his Down is excellent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cockerrico</HI> is the <HI>Indian</HI> name for the <HI>Tobago Phe|&s;ants,</HI> which
are as large, and as fair as our <HI>Engli&s;h Phe|&s;ants;</HI> and tho&s;e that have fed upon

&s;hot from the Bows of Trees.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Curlews,</HI> the one of them is red, and as bigg as a Capon; that
has a crooked long beak, and gets his living by &s;ucking in &s;alt-water-pla&s;hes. But the grey
<HI>Curlew,</HI> which is &s;haped like the red one, differs onely in colour, and in feeding in the
fre&s;hes. They are both choice food, for tho&s;e that feed on them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wood-Pidgeon</HI> &s;o called here, feeds mo&s;t upon Ber|ries; and is to my thinking
the choice&s;t food in <HI>Ameri|ca.</HI> This Bird is bigger than an <HI>Engli&s;h Pidgeon,</HI>
and are &s;ometimes &s;o fat that they bur&s;t with their fall, when we have taken them off from
tops of Trees with our

<P>Moreover this I&s;land of <HI>Tobago</HI> for rai&s;ing of &s;tock, may make &s;uch improvement

&s;hipping; except what's tran&s;ported to <HI>Barbados</HI> and other Parts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Green Hart</HI> is next, which I take to be <HI>Hercules;</HI> and of this &s;ort of

<P>Then there is the <HI>Locust</HI> of two &s;everal &s;orts, the one white, and the other is red,
from two to three foot dia|meter; either of them are very good Timber for building Hou&s;es, Shores
for Milnes, Spindles, and Shafts: they are good to make Beams, and Knees for &s;hipping, or

<P>The <HI>Man-grove,</HI> by &s;ome called <HI>Red-wood,</HI> the proper u&s;e of the Wood is for

Trinidado,</HI> that lies di&s;tant about &s;ome &s;even Leagues, and not above twenty miles North
from the <HI>Verines;</HI> from whence comes the be&s;t <HI>Tobacco</HI> in the world. Several
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els have I &s;een loaden from <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and the <HI>Tobacco</HI> &s;old
in the <HI>Role</HI> for 2 <HI><ABBR>s.</ABBR> per</HI> pound, which Merchandize they tran&s;port
to old <HI>Spain</HI> and other Parts to advance the price, which turns to con&s;iderable profit.
So that in <HI>Tobago</HI> I per&s;wade my &s;elf that a &s;tout labouring man may make 3000
<ABBR>l.</ABBR> of <HI>To|bacco</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="19">into Roll every year, and do it with a great deal of ea&s;e, which if &s;old
but at &s;even pence <HI>per</HI> pound &s;ter|ling, comes to a con&s;iderable &s;um; as the
<HI>Holander</HI> when they had the I&s;land ingro&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, and gave &s;ix
<HI>Sti|vers</HI> for it there: which was afterwards tran&s;ported to con&s;iderable profit.</P>
<P><HI>Indigo</HI> is a certain vveed that grows in <HI>Barbados,</HI> and in mo&s;t of the
<HI>Leward</HI> I&s;lands: but the be&s;t to my ob&s;er|vation grevv in <HI>Guatimale,</HI> vvhich
lies in or near the la|titude of <HI>Tobago;</HI> by vvhich I may rationally conclude that as good
<HI>Indigo</HI> may be made here, as there; that one hand may dre&s;s up, and cure 1500 pound
vveight in one year, all materials fitted, and the vveed brought to the place.</P>
<P>There are tvvo &s;orts of <HI>Cotton;</HI> Ravil and Vine, of either &s;ort of vvhich an
indu&s;trious Planter may Plant tvvo thou&s;and vveight in a year: and this I look upon is the
meane&s;t &s;taple in <HI>Tobago</HI> for a man to go upon, and employ his hands.</P>
<P><HI>Ginger,</HI> That's another Staple; and as good grows here as in any part of the World,
which admits of two &s;everal ways of curing to better it: &s;o that &s;ome &s;cal'd and dry it,
other&s;ome &s;crape it; but the la&s;t is be&s;t, and more then doubles the price, let Markets
rule as they will. But of the fir&s;t its ordinary for one man to make &s;even Thou&s;and pound
vveight a year.</P>
<P><HI>Sar&s;aparilla,</HI> is a Spani&s;h drug that grows in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> of which by
rea&s;on of the great plenty in <HI>Tobago,</HI> one man I per&s;wade my &s;elf, may gather and dry
as much as by mode&s;t Computation comes to eighty, or a hundred pound Sterling a year.</P>
<P><HI>Semper Vioum,</HI> is a certain Juicy Plant, that's guard|ed with a priekle Leaf; I need not
tell you the u&s;e, and vertue of this Plant, of which the Planter here, as in
<PB N="34" REF="20"><HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. may make as good Aloes, as that which comes from
<HI>Succotrina.</HI> So that a Thou&s;and weight of Aloes <HI>Succotrina,</HI> will countervale the
value of two Thou&s;and of <HI>Hippatica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bees-wax,</HI> is another Staple; of the Honey we make Metheglen, or expo&s;e it to other
u&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vinillios</HI> grows like the Cod of a French bean, and is &s;omewhat flat, and thinner,
and full of &s;mall &s;eeds. It generally grows upon bu&s;hes, or Brambles that &s;pread
them&s;elves upon Rocks. So that when it blo&s;&s;oms, it &s;ends forth &s;uch a fragancy as
perfumes the Air; and when the Codds are ripening, they fir&s;t turn green, after that brown, and
la&s;t of all a more Ob|&s;cure Colour. Some u&s;e them as a perfume for <HI>Choca|lata,</HI> or
other wi&s;e to put among&s;t Cloths. But the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> pickle them for Tran&s;portation,
and their way, and manner is by &s;calding them in a pickle made up with Salt and Lime-water, which
afterwards they dry up, and bind them in Bundels of about one hundred in a bundle; which bundles
have been &s;old in <HI>England</HI> for twenty, thirty, or fourty Shillings a Bundle: of the&s;e
&s;weet Cods I per&s;wade my &s;elf that an active man may gather as much in a &s;ea&s;on, as will
amount to the value of ten thou&s;and Codds, and not loo&s;e much time.</P>
<P>The Natural <HI>Bal&s;am</HI> (as we call it) is a certain &s;appy juice, that i&s;&s;ues forth
of the body of the tree, after you have wounded it, by making a hole therein; &s;o tap it, and the
Liquor de&s;cends into a clean Gourd, or any o|ther Ve&s;&s;el that's placed under it. The leaf of
this tree differs but a little from that of the Fig-tree, and the <HI>Bal|&s;am</HI> of mo&s;t
&s;overaign u&s;e for wounds, both in ward and outward. Yet the true Valuation of this excellent
Bal&s;am, is hitherto unknown. However great quanti|ties,
<PB N="35" REF="20">as thirty or fourty Gallons, may be gathered in a year, by a diligent and
indu&s;trous man.</P>
<P>And then there's the <HI>Balm,</HI> (like that) of <HI>Gilea,</HI> (and equal in Vertue for
ought I know) that comes from the Flower of the Bal&s;am-tree, who&s;e Leaf is Yellow, of a golden
colour, and as big as a Ro&s;e when the flower is full blown, in which yellow Ro&s;e, there appears
about &s;ome three or four bubbles, or drops of an Amber colour, each of the bigne&s;s of a Pea,
which &s;prings out of the Ro&s;e, and is that excellent and miraculous Balm, more valuable then
Money. But the vertues I acquired of an <HI>Indian,</HI> who in&s;tructed me in the u&s;e on't,
which at that juncture of time proved fortunate to me, when to con&s;ider the cut, and brui&s;e of
my finger that made me langui&s;h under intollerable pain, yet in one Minutes time to be relea&s;ed
from pain: and within le&s;s than twenty four hours to receive an ab&s;olute cure, confirm|ed it a
Medicament of admirable vertues. Of which pre|cious Balm, I mode&s;tly judge near forty pound
weight might be gathered (by an indu&s;trous man) in le&s;s &s;pace of time then eight or ten
months, be&s;ides other Labor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Silk-Gra&s;s,</HI> &s;o called, is a Plant that flouri&s;hes mo&s;t in moi&s;t bottoms,
and has a large broad long and thick Leaf, guarded with Prickles, not much unlike the teeth of a
Saw, yet &s;pread them&s;elves every way; out of the Centre of the&s;e Leaves there grows a
&s;talk, twelve or fourteen foot high, to four or five inches Diameter, to|wards the Bottom. When
this &s;talk begins to Wi|ther, then the leaves are cut away, and laid in Water as you do Hemp;
afterwards they dry it in the Sun, then hackle off the rotten pitthy &s;ub&s;tance which adheres to
the more purer part of the &s;ilk-gra&s;s, which may be &s;pun to the finene&s;s of &s;ilk,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereof you may make furniture for hou&s;es, or habits for your &s;elf and others.

<PB N="36" REF="21">But the general u&s;e of it is to make Ropes, and fi&s;hing Lines, of which to
my certain knowledge there's no &s;tronger, nor better in the World, and is a good Staple.</P>
<P><HI>Arnotto</HI> or <HI>Annotto,</HI> its all one, (the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call it
<HI>Rocoo</HI>) it &s;trikes a deep red, and is profitable for Dyers. The plenty of this Plant is
&s;uch here that one man on an Acre of ground may in one years time make a thou&s;and pound Weight:
but the <HI>Annotto</HI> is cured two &s;everal ways: Fir&s;t the <HI>Barrel,</HI> which is an
inferiour &s;ort, and barrel'd up whiles as yet its moi&s;t: but the Cakes are dryed in the
<HI>Sun.</HI> I have &s;et down the method, and or|der for both. This <HI>Annotto</HI> groweth in
prickly Burrs, like Tea&s;els, which Burrs when they be ripe, are full of Red &s;eeds that are to
be gathered in dry Weather, and put on a clean floor to thra&s;h out the &s;eed, which af|terwards
ought to be put into a Fatt, and &s;teeped there till the water elicites a deep red Tincture: which
the rather and &s;ooner is done, if provided you &s;ometimes &s;tir it. Then with a &s;ieve, (or
&s;omewhat el&s;e of a like nature) they &s;eparate the &s;eeds from the tincture by let|ting the
water run through a Fo&s;&s;et till nothing vi&s;ibly remains, but a Recrement or Sedement in the
bottom, which &s;ub&s;tance when like batter, they put it into Bar|rels, and &s;o tran&s;port it.
But others more curious, dry it in the <HI>Sun,</HI> which makes it better, and fitter for &s;ale;
and to yield almo&s;t a double price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Green Tarr</HI> i&s;&s;ues out of the earth from the <HI>Mun|jack Rocks,</HI> and is
commonly gathered after a &s;hower of Rain, by skimming it off from the &s;urface of the Water; and
then put it into a great Gourd, or &s;uch like Ve&s;&s;el, that has a hole at the bottom, they
&s;eparate the Oyl from the Water, by &s;uffering the Water to &s;lide gently out, but vvhen the
Oyl appears, they cautiou&s;ly &s;top and pre|&s;erve it for &s;everal &s;ervile u&s;es, as to burn
in Lamps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="21">and has a mo&s;t foveraign vertue to help again&s;t pains, and Aches in any
part of the Body. In the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago</HI> great quantities of this Oyl is
procurable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Munjack</HI> is nothing el&s;e than a Confirmation or Coagulation of the <HI>Tarr</HI>
(we &s;poke of) into a more &s;o|lid body, which <HI>Munjack</HI> were it in a frigid, as it is in
the torrid <HI>Zone,</HI> would be ab&s;olute Cole, &s;uch as we burn in <HI>England.</HI> This
<HI>Munjack</HI> after its beat into pow|der, they incorporate or mingle it with Earth, to burn
under their Coppers in <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> otherwi&s;e it runs in|to an oily Sub&s;tance, by
rea&s;on of the heat; as has been ob&s;erved by melted Pitch, in&s;tead whereof the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;ub&s;titutes <HI>Munjack.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Soap Earth,</HI> repre&s;ents to me a kind of Clay, that Nature has indued with vertue,
and the Qualifica|tion of clean&s;ing, and purifying other bodies: which di&s;&s;olves in Salt, or
in fre&s;h Water; and makes a lather like &s;ope-&s;udds, wherewith I wa&s;hed my hands; and it not
only &s;coured them, but took off the tanning to Ad|miration, and &s;o it happens either to Linnen
or Wool|en; by rea&s;on of its Mundificative Vertue and Quali|ty.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a <HI>Clay</HI> that &s;erves to clay Sugar with, or you may if you plea&s;e
make Earthen ware thereof. Moreover it will make good Brick or Tile, or to mingle it with Sand, you
may &s;hape it into Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Many curious Shells, &s;tones, Marka&s;ites, and Mine|rals are found up and down the I&s;land of
<HI>Tobago,</HI> who&s;e vertue and worth is as yet unknown, and as by the Bounty of Heaven here's
plenty enough for the Su&s;ten|tation of Man, and Bea&s;t: &s;o by a natural in&s;tinct, and
inclination Nature opens her doors of Trea&s;ure, where|with to adorn, and inrich the indu&s;trous:
God is plea&s;|ed to endue this I&s;land with plenty, &s;o let her Inhabi|tants

<HEAD>Directions for Improvement in the I&s;land of <HI>TOBAGO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUppo&s;e a Man that has an hundred pound Sterlin is minded to tran&s;port him&s;elf; and
Family, con&s;i&s;t|ing of eleven in number, to this I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e
their pa&s;&s;ages may co&s;t him fifty pound; and Manuals with other things requi&s;ite and
nece&s;&s;ary for Planting, as al&s;o Provi&s;ion for the fir&s;t twelve months, together with the
charge of Hou&s;hold &s;tuffs, and all o|ther Nece&s;&s;aries, may &s;tand him in 47
<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> more: Suppo&s;e al&s;o this man takes a Lea&s;e of fifty Acres
of Land for a thou&s;and years, at the rate of twelve-pence an Acre anually, it amounts but to two
pound ten &s;hil|lings a year, (except otherwi&s;e he purcha&s;e the Fee &s;imple of the
Proprietors) which compleats the hun|dred pound; This is the fir&s;t Money laid out; nor need he be
at any more charge, for in twelve months time he will have ground provi&s;ion enough, and in all
Pro|bability two Crops of Tobacco.</P>
<P>The next thing to con&s;ider of, is the Improvement of the &s;aid Land; which is as followeth.
After your Arrival in the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago</HI> the fir&s;t &s;ix Months may
<PB N="39" REF="22">be &s;pent to clear fifteen Acres of Land, and to put Provi&s;ions into the
ground; to build Conveniencies to accomodate your &s;elf, and Family, to adapt and fit the ground
for planting a Nur&s;ery of <HI>Cacoa-nuts;</HI> as al&s;o a bed &s;owed with <HI>Tobacco</HI>
&s;eeds, and be &s;ure to keep your Nur&s;ery clear from Weeds. Then about a Months time after you
have &s;own your Tobacco &s;eed (provided the Sea&s;ons be good) you may then draw your Tobacco
Plants, and plant them about &s;ome four foot di&s;tance, one from another, regularly and in rows:
which &s;aid Tobacco <HI>Tobago</HI> produces, is nothing inferiour to <HI>Spa|ni&s;h
Trinidado,</HI> that lies about &s;eaven Leagues di&s;tance from the &s;aid I&s;land of
<HI>Tobago,</HI> where I have &s;een the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (when I was a Pri&s;oner among&s;t
them) &s;ell great quantities of <HI>Trinidado Tobacco</HI> at the rate of two Shillings a pound;
which &s;aid <HI>Tobacco</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> tran&s;port from thence, to old
<HI>Spain;</HI> and &s;ell it there to con&s;iderable advantage. Now among&s;t your
<HI>Tobac|co</HI> plants, you may plant your <HI>Cocoa,</HI> and tran&s;plant them when about &s;ix
Months old, into new ground, fitted at ten or twelve foot di&s;tance; and be &s;ure to keep clean
from Weeds; In which latter &s;ix Months time, you may have on your cleared ground two Crops of
<HI>Tobacco.</HI> Now admiting you make but eight thou&s;and weight of Neat <HI>Tobacco</HI> on the
&s;aid Ground; yet in all probability (provided your People be healthy) it may double the number to
&s;ixteen thou|&s;and. But if it do not, and put the ca&s;e your <HI>Tobacco</HI> fell but for an
eighth part of what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ell for in <HI>Trinidado</HI> (which is but three
pence <HI>per</HI> pound fold here in our I&s;land) yet will this Crop yield you one hundred pounds
Sterlin, which is your Money gained the very fir&s;t year, and in &s;ix month time, all charges
being born.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e that at the beginning of the &s;econd year
<PB N="40" REF="23">the &s;aid fifteen Acres be all cleared; and Provi&s;ion e|nough put into
<HI>the ground</HI> &s;ufficient for double your num|ber of hands: you may rationally then expect
four Crops in twelve Months time, when as formerly you made two Crops in the la&s;t &s;ix Months.
So that with the hundred pounds you gained la&s;t year, you may now purcha&s;s &s;even or eight
&s;laves, or Servants; which may in all probability treble the fir&s;t year. But put the ca&s;e it
but only double, yet at the wor&s;t it may yield you (and all charges born) two hundred pounds
Sterlin.</P>
<P>Now we cannot otherwi&s;e conclude (if things &s;uc|ceed well) but that the third year will
double the &s;econd year by improvement, as above is expre&s;t; and if &s;o, then your Crop will
amount to four hundred pounds Sterlin.</P>
<P>And the fourth year doubles the third year, by rea|&s;on the <HI>Cocoa</HI> that was planted the
fir&s;t year on the fif|teen Acres of Land, may produce to the value of thir|ty pounds Sterlin an
Acre; be&s;ides the encrea&s;e of <HI>To|bacco,</HI> and clearing of more ground, together with
your encrea&s;e of Servants, and &s;laves; and planting of more <HI>Cacao</HI> Trees, which at
lea&s;t will ari&s;e to eight hundred pounds &s;terlin, the fourth year.</P>
<P>The fifth year, in all Probability doubles the fourth; by rea&s;on the <HI>Cocoa</HI> that was
fir&s;t planted, yeilds now to the value of &s;ixty pound Sterling an Acre, as the &s;e|cond years
planted <HI>Cocoa</HI> yielded but thirty pounds per Acre. So that clearing of more ground, and
purcha|&s;ing more &s;laves, and Servants; your produce of <HI>Cocoa</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI>
clears you at lea&s;t one thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred pounds Sterlin, as now the price goes.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth year you may very well clear three thou&s;and pounds &s;terlin, and all charges
borne; by rea&s;on the <HI>Cocoa</HI> planted the fir&s;t year, is now come to perfection, &amp; is
at its full height of bearing; Which in this Latitude may yield
<PB N="41" REF="23">one hundred ponnd Sterling an Acre. <HI>(viz.)</HI> the fir&s;t fifteen Acres
which were Planted the fir&s;t year. And the &s;econd years Plants Planted the &s;econd year, will
yield you &s;ixty pound &s;terling, &amp; the third years Plants, as by the &s;ame calculation, may
yield you thirty pound Sterlin an Acre. So that by purcha&s;ing the more &s;er|vants, and &s;laves,
you may if you plea&s;e decline &s;o much planting of Tobacco as formerly you did.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh year you will have all your Land Planted with <HI>Cocoa;</HI> and that
encrea&s;ing, you need not plant a|bove ten, or fifteen Acres of <HI>Tobacco</HI> this year,
among&s;t your <HI>Cocao;</HI> but you may Plant provi&s;ions among&s;t them for &s;upport and
maintenance of your &s;elf and Family. So that from that increa&s;e of your &s;eventh years Crop,
you may hope, and expect by a mode&s;t computation, to clear from the &s;aid fifty Acres of Land,
at lea&s;t five thou&s;and pounds Sterling a year.</P>
<P>And now we come to the Rea&s;ons for this great im|provement; you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Trinidado, &amp;c.</HI> give among them&s;elves one hundred pounds
Sterling, for a Nigro Slave, and yet the &s;aid &s;lave will not &s;tand his ma&s;ter in one
&s;ingle penny, at the years end for his purcha&s;e. And all the labour and &s;er|vice the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> imploys him in the year about, is on|ly in <HI>Cocoa,</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h
Tobacco,</HI> in this our Latitude.</P>
<P>Now pray con&s;ider, that we can have Nigro Slaves brought and delivered to us at fifteen pound
&s;terling a head; by rea&s;on we have an open trade, and the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> allows not of a
free trade. VVhere note the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> pays &s;ixpence, or more for every thing he wants;
when we can have the &s;ame for a &s;ingle peny. That's one rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on is, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> cannot have any <HI>Tunage</HI> for goods from
old <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and
<PB N="42" REF="24">home again, for le&s;s then forty or fifty pounds &s;terling <HI>per Tun;</HI>
be&s;ides the Duties run very high. And we can have Freight for five or &s;ix pounds <HI>per
Tun,</HI> and no Duties from us to a free Port. VVhen therefore to con&s;ider and compute the
charge on either &s;ide, we pro|fit by what we tran&s;port, &s;ix to one. VVhich makes the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> generally &s;o poor in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and we ge|nerally to flouri&s;h &s;o
much the more.</P>
<P>The third rea&s;on is, that in a Ship of three hundred <HI>Tun,</HI> the Spaniard has &s;eldom
le&s;s then two hundred men belonging to her; and the wages of each man comes at lea&s;t to Fifty
Shillings Sterling <HI>per</HI> month: which in the whole amounts to five hundred pound a month,
barely for wages; then you are to Con&s;ider the month|ly Provi&s;ion to accomodate the&s;e men
cannot come to le&s;s then one hundred and &s;ixty pound Sterlin, and ten months at &s;ix hundred
and &s;ixty pound <HI>per</HI> Month, amounts to &s;ix thou&s;and and five hundred pounds Sterlin
for ten Months. Moreover this Ship of three hundred Tun, &s;eldom carries le&s;s then forty Pieces
of Ordinance, which with their Provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by mode&s;t computation takes up no
le&s;s room then one hundred and fifty Tun. So that the Ship in all Probability cannot bring home
more then one hundred and fifty tun of Merchants goods, and the fraight of the&s;e goods comes to
forty pound Sterlin a tun. So that by this Calculation they mu&s;t be loo&s;ers at lea&s;t &s;ix
hundred pound Sterlin, and at fourty five pound-<HI>per</HI> tun, to pay ware and tare of the Ship,
and mens wages. So that for the &s;hips ware and tare it comes barely but to one hundred and fifty
pound Sterlin clear:</P>
<P>Now admit an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip of three hundred tun, be bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and
&s;uppo&s;e the fraight of this &s;hip be at &s;ix pound &s;terlin <HI>per</HI> tun, this &s;hip
&s;hall make her voy|age
<PB N="43" REF="24">better in eight months time then the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;hall in ten Months;
now the fraight of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hip comes to one thou&s;and eight hundred pound
&s;terlin, and the Wages and Victuals of the &s;aid Ship at &s;ixty pound <HI>per</HI> Month, comes
to four hundred and eighty pound &s;ter|lin, &s;o that you &s;ee the Ship clears for her ware and
tare the &s;um of one thou&s;and three hundred and twenty pound &s;terlin: See here therefore the
great difference.</P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t rea&s;on is this; The King of <HI>Spain</HI> contracts with a body of
Merchants to furni&s;h the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> with four thou&s;and <HI>Nigros</HI> every year;
and the <HI>Nigrillos</HI> or Merchants there engage to pay the King one hundred peices of Eight
Cu&s;tom for each <HI>Ni|gro</HI> &s;lave brought unto them. VVhich comes to four hundred
thou&s;and pieces of Eight by the year, which is paid to the &s;aid King, the King therefore
prohibits all Merchants, and others, for bringing <HI>Nigros</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI>
And each piece of Eight is valued at five &s;hillings &s;terlin in <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but in the
<HI>Lee-ward I&s;lands</HI> it goes for &s;ix.</P>
