<P>AMong other Per&s;ons of Reputation, who&s;e Actions have gain|ed an immortal Fame in the World, and that &s;urprize with Wonder and A&s;toni&s;hment all that read the Relations of their extraordinary Atchievements, there is none more remarkable than Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> the Subject of this Hi&s;tory, who was a Gentle|man that liv'd in the ancient Village of the <HI>Mancha</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> a Man &s;o extreamly given up to the reading of Romances, and &s;uch other Books as treated of Knight-Errantry; that at la&s;t he re&s;olved to put it in practice him&s;elf, and make him&s;elf more Renowned than tho&s;e Heroes he had read of in Romantick Legends; of whom he had &s;o great an Opinion that he always &s;poke of 'em with the profounde&s;t Reverence; and took it very ill to hear any one que&s;tion the Truth of what had been recorded in their Prai&s;es: Yea, &s;o great was his Credulity in the&s;e things, that he dur&s;t engage for the Veracity of of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tom Thumb</HI> is &s;elf. It will not be very material to
<PB N="3" REF="2"> trouble the Reader with a long Bed-roll of his Ance&s;tors, nor of tho&s;e Mannors and Lord&s;hips which they left him; which I cou'd never under&s;tand to be very great; for to &s;ay truth, his Family was but &s;o, &s;o; yet he kept a working Servant to manage his Country Affairs, and al&s;o an old Woman, or Governant, as is u&s;ual in <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> who had the care of Dome&s;tick concerns; be&s;ides the&s;e, there was in his Family a young Plump Girl, under twenty, who was his Si&s;ter's Daughter; nor mu&s;t I forget that he had an old Hor&s;e, who never fail'd him in all his Noble Adventures; as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention hereafter. I will not be an&s;werable for the Furniture of his Cellar and his Pantry, let it &s; ffice that his Hall was plentifully accom|modated with Swords, Pikes, and Javelins, with Murrions, Back and Bre&s;t Pieces; which tho' by rea&s;on of di&s;u&s;e they were almo&s;t &s;poil'd with Ru&s;t and Cobwebs; yet this hinder'd not our Hero, when he came to &s;hew the World the Prowe&s;s of his doughty Arm; for he furbi&s;hed both Back and Brea&s;t, and took his Great Grandfa|ther's Basket-hilted Sword, and Lance al&s;o: But the greate&s;t thing wanting, was an Helmet, which all his &s;tore could not help him to; and yet his good Fortune brought him &s;omething that he made &s;hift with in the room of it; and that was a Mu&s;ty Murrion, of which his Niece &s;ometimes upon occa&s;ion made a Chamber-pot; this he &s;o furni&s;hed, that with the help of a Bra&s;s Potlid that he gave a work|man to hammer a Beaver out of it, he made a very good &s;hift with, rivetting, or rather clouting it together: This Don <HI>Quixote</HI> (for &s;o is our New Knight-Errant to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd) clapped on his Head, and finding it cover'd his Ears, he made no doubt he had now gotten Armour of Proof to &s;ecure his Noddle (for I cann't &s;ay his Brains) from the Swords of tho&s;e Knights he meant to Encounter with, and the clubbs of tho&s;e Giants he de&s;ign'd to cut in Pieces; for you mu&s;t know he had a mighty Antipathy again&s;t Giants, becau&s;e of their barbarous Cruelty to courteous Knights, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ladies.</P>
<P>All things being now ready for his &s;etting out, he call'd for his tru&s;ty Steed, that he might confer upon him a Name according to the cu&s;tom of former times in &s;uch ca&s;es; that the poor Bea&s;t, as well as him&s;elf, might be immortaliz'd in Hi&s;tory and perhaps be as fam'd as <HI>Bucephalus, Boyardo,</HI> or <HI>Belieca,</HI> of whom there is &s;uch advan|tagious Mention made in Hi&s;tory. And that he might give him a &s;ignificant Name, he call'd him <HI>Rozinante,</HI> which in the Spani&s;h Lang|uage &s;ignifies a Hor&s;e of Carriage, or of Labour; which he having
<PB N="4" REF="3"> pronounched Emphatically, thought it &s;ounded with a very good Grace. But being ready to mount, he happily bethought him&s;elf that the mo&s;t material thing was yet wanting, and that was, a Lady &s;o who&s;e Shrine he might offer up all his Services: For to be a Knight Errant, without an adored Lady, that might reap the Advantage of of all his mighty Atchievements, wou'd look like a Pudding without Fat: For thus did our Knight expo&s;tula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;elf: <HI>To what pur|po&s;e &s;hou'd I over throw &s;ome famous Knight-Errant to the Ground, or, conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s; me mighty Giant at a &s;troke, that they may pro&s;trate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Earth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mpl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">re my Mercy, if I have got no Mi&s;tre&s;s who may receive the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nour of my Services? and whom the trembi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g Wretches thus may &s;up|plicate:</HI> I am the Famous Giant <HI>Corculiambro,</HI> the lately dreaded Lord of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">indr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nia,</HI> whom the Victorious and ever-valiant Knight Don <HI>Quixote</HI> de la <HI>Mancha,</HI> has in one &s;ingle Combat over-come; and by this brave unconquerable Worthy, am I enjoyn'd thus lowly on the Earth, to bow my &s;elf to you, as to the Soveraign Lady of his Heart, and to intreat you &s;o to order and di&s;po&s;e of me as unto your Illu&s;trious Lady&s;hip &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t fit. This, thought our mighty Hero, wou'd be worth &s;eeking out Adventures for. But now where he &s;hou'd find a Mi&s;tre&s;s worth all this Toil he was to undertake, was an Her|culean Labour: But his propiticus Stars at la&s;t brought to his thoughts a hand&s;ome Country Wench, who&s;e Name was <HI>Allon&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oren&s;a</HI> the Daughter of a Butcher, whom he believ'd (tho' he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d never &s;een her) by the report of his own Plow-man, to be a celebrated Beauty; to her he was re&s;olv'd to pay the mo&s;t &s;incere and la&s;ting of his Vows; only he thought her Name &s;hou'd be new Vampt, that it might &s;ound at lea&s;t more like the Title of &s;ome mighty Prince&s;s; knowing the ingle of a Name his a great matter in't; and &s;o he metamorphos'd it into <HI>Dulcinea</HI> del <HI>Tobo&s;a,</HI> the latter part of it relating to the place of her Nativity: Thus chang'd, he fancy'd it to carry &s;o Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">monious a &s;ound, he'd &s;carce have chang'd it for the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI>'s.

<P>IT was no &s;mall Trouble to Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> to lo&s;e his Library; for &s;eeing now he could not con&s;ult with his Books about the Laws of Knight-Errantry, he was fain to have recour&s;e to his own Memory; and from thence furni&s;h'd him&s;elf the be&s;t he could: And recollecting him&s;elf, he found it always u&s;ual for Knight-Errants to have Squires to attend 'em; the want of which he look'd upon to be the principal Occa&s;ion of his late Misfortunes: Having re&s;olv'd upon a Squire, the next thing was, who mu&s;t be he? And he had no &s;ooner put this Que&s;tion to him&s;elf, but &s;traight it came into his Mind, that there was a Fellow who was a near Neighbour of his, that had as little Wit, and as many Maggots almo&s;t as him&s;elf: This Man he pitch'd upon, as one worthy of the Honour of his E&s;quire; and going immediately to treat with him, upon our Hero's Promi&s;e to make him the Gover|nour of an I&s;land, as &s;oon as he &s;hou'd Conquer it, <HI>Sancho</HI> (or <HI>Simple|ton</HI> rather) promis'd to attend him as his tru&s;ty Squire. The Agree|ment, thus made, <HI>Sancho Pancha,</HI> (for &s;o was this Squire named) was order'd the next light Night to &s;teal away from his Spou&s;e and her Daughter, and to take along with him <HI>Dapple</HI> his A&s;s, and a Wallet to carry &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries in as they &s;hou'd have occa&s;ion for: And &s;o to come to him behind his Palace, where he &s;hou'd find him
<PB N="12" REF="7"> ready equipp'd for the intended Undertaking. But Don <HI>Quixote</HI> know|ing Money to be the Sinews of War, was now re&s;olv'd to be well provi|ded for whatever adver&s;e Fortune he &s;hould happen to encounter with; and to that end, turn'd one of his principal Mannors into ready Rhino; and then having &s;tor'd him&s;elf with whatever he thought he might want; and the Squire waiting on him at the time prefix'd, they &s;et forward unknown to any but them&s;elves, and making the be&s;t of their Way, had got &s;o far by that time the Morning Sun had gilded the Tops of the Mountains, that they were out of Fear of being pur&s;ued by tho&s;e that would per&s;vvade them to return.</P>
<P>And novv being come into a &s;pacious Field, Don <HI>Quixote</HI> vvas re|&s;olv'd to open the Campaign vvith a very memorable Adventure: For di&s;covering certain Windmils before him, he thus addre&s;s'd him|&s;elf to his Squire, <HI>I have now,</HI> Sancho, <HI>a just Occa&s;ion to exert my Valour against tho&s;e common Enemies to Knight-Errantry, the Giants: f r look,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>with what a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cked Force they brandi&s;h their extended Arms, as if they'd even dare me to the Combat; but I &s;hall &s;oon make them repent their Folly, and enrich thee with their Spoils.</HI> To this, <HI>Sancho</HI> (who plainly &s;avv they vvere nothing but Windmils) return'd this An&s;vver, <HI>Ma|&s;ter, You &s;adly mi&s;take, or el&s;e your Eyes deceive you; for the&s;e Giants you think you &s;ee before you, are nothing el&s;e but Windmils.

<P>After having eaten their fill, they had &s;carce clo&s;ed the Wallet, before they e&s;pied in a low De&s;cent between two Hills, where the Way was very narrow, two Hor&s;emen and at a little di&s;tance a Coach coming after them, and Hor&s;emen, riding after it: <HI>See,</HI> &s;aid Don <HI>Quixot, what a worthy Adventure now offers it&s;elf to Immortalize my Name, for the&s;e Villians are carying &s;ome great Prince&s;s captive, who now implores my Aid for her Re&s;cue: I &s;aw her but now bold up her Hand to me to come and help her: But I command you</HI> Sancho, <HI>whatever Condi|tion thou &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t me in, &s;tir not a Foot to my A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d, for 'tis again&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Laws of Knight-Errantry.

<P>After this Encounter, the Knight and his Squire rid on together, and the Wound the former had received in his Ear, troubling him, becau&s;e they had not yet bought any Medicines, <HI>Sancho</HI> chew'd a lit|tle Chee&s;e in his Mouth, and &s;o apply'd it to the Part affected.

<P>DOn <HI>Quixote</HI> and his Squire having been well entertain'd by the Goat-heards, and told by them a Story of the fair <HI>Marcelia</HI>'s in|habiting an unfrequented Forre&s;t, our Knight re&s;olved to go in que&s;t of her, and offer her his Service: But &s;earching through a va&s;t For|re&s;t till they both were weary, vvithout finding her, they at la&s;t came to a fair Meadovv, through vvhich there ran a curious Brook, upon the flovvry Banks vvhereof, he was re&s;olved to re&s;t him&s;elf; and

And now Night approaching, af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">r they had eaten &s;ome Sheeps-trotters for Supper, they were coducted to Bed, being had up to a Room where there was three Beds, one for Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> another for <HI>Sancho,</HI> and a third for a rough hewen Carrier, who us'd to lye at that Inn, and though the Lodging was very indifferent, they knew not where to get a better, and &s;o were forc'd to make &s;hift with it: Don <HI>Quixote</HI> being kept awake by the Angui&s;h of his Brui|&s;es, &s;eeing the Chamber-door open, and one coming towards him all in white, imagin'd it to be either the Lady of the Ca&s;tle, or rather her Daughter, and that &s;he was fallen in Love with him; but the truth of it was, it was the Maid of the Hou&s;e, who &s;uppo&s;ing all fa&s;t a&s;leep, was &s;tealing to the Carrier's Bed, according to her Agreement before made with him. Don <HI>Quixote</HI> full of Imagination, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">hes her fa&s;t by the Hand, and pulls her to his Bed-&s;ide, courting her in a Roman|tick Stile, while &s;he &s;trove to get loo&s;e, but was afraid to make a Noi&s;e, le&s;t &s;he &s;hou'd be di&s;cover'd; in this Cond tion; the Carrier leap'd out of Bed to her Re&s;cue, and without &s;peaking, gave Don <HI>Quixote</HI> &s;uch a Blow o'th' Face with his Fi&s;t, that he made the Blood come, but keeping &s;till his Hold, the Carrier got upon him, and al|mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ed his Guts out; when the Bed being over-burden'd with his Weight, fell to the Ground; this caus'd the Innkeeper to leap out of his Bed in the next Room, and run to &s;ee what was the matter: The Wench being got loo&s;e, &s;lipt into <HI>Sancho</HI>'s Bed, and fearing to be found, cover'd her&s;elf over Head and Ears, lying as round as a Foot-ball; <HI>Sancho,</HI> tho' he was before fa&s;t a&s;leep, yet the Bu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters">e made at her coming into Bed awaked him; who finding a round Dulc at his Back, thought it a Night-mare come to Hag-ride him, and lays
<PB N="18" REF="10"> upon her with his clo&s;ed Fi&s;ts, with all his Might; this &s;o provoked the Wench, that not regarding her Shame, &s;he gets upon her Knees, and falls up|on him &s;o &s;everely, that he cries out Murther. This Cry alarm'd one of the Brotherhood, who make Vows to clear the Road of all Rogues and Thieves; who lodg'd in the Hou&s;e, and running into the Chamber, with his Staff of Office, and meeting forthwith the Inn-keeper, commanded him to deliver up him&s;elf to the Officers of Ju&s;tice; but the Inn-keeper crying out, two O&s;tlers came in to help him, who &s;o belabour'd the poor Knight of the Bro|therhood, that he was glad to fly the Room, and leave his Staff of Authority broken behind him. In the mean time the Wench made &s;hift to get to her Bed, and there feign'd her&s;elf as fa&s;t a&s;leep, as if &s;he had never been concern'd in the Matter. The Inn-keeper who had got out at a private Door, retur|ned again with a Light, demanding what was the Occa&s;ion of the Uproar? There was none knew how to an&s;wer him, but Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> who lying in a mi&s;erable Pickle, begun a Tale of a Tub, telling him, That a fair Lady, who was a mighty Enchantre&s;s, bore that high Re&s;pect to his Worth and Re|nown, that &s;he often paid him nightly Vi&s;its; and came that very Night to cure his Hurts: But an enchanted Moor, who had a furious Pa&s;&s;ion for her, for which &s;he had chain'd him by her Magick, had broke his Chains that Night to follow her, being very jealous of the Favours &s;he had &s;hew'd to him; and &s;o had done the Mi&s;chief, and made the Noi&s;e which had di&s;turb'd the Hou&s;e. But <HI>Sancho</HI> quite &s;poil'd this Story, by telling them of a Wench in her Smock, that leap'd into his Bed, for he had felt her <HI>Tuquoque;</HI> which made the Inn-keeper give a better Gue&s;s at the matter; for he well e|nough knew the Wench's Lightne&s;s, and went half Snips in the Gain, and for that rea&s;on he &s;eem'd to incline more to our Knight-Errant's Story, as being more for the Credit of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Quixote</HI> and <HI>Sancho,</HI> not liking their Entertainment very well, got up early the next Morning, and being mounted, and ready to depart, the Inn-keeper catch'd hold of Don <HI>Quixote</HI>'s Hor&s;e's Bridle, telling him he mu&s;t pay for what he had before he went. But that being contrary to the Laws of Knight-Errantry, Don <HI>Quixote</HI> told him he was the mo&s;t di&s;courteous Governour of a Ca&s;tle that he ever met with; having never had any de|manded of him before; adding, That the Hazards that he went thro' for the Service of his Country, in ridding it of Giants and Mon&s;ters, was a &s;uf|ficient Compen&s;ation for what he had where-ever he came. The Inn-keeper reply'd, That his Hou&s;e was no Ca&s;tle, but an Inn to entertain Travellers, and that he car'd not a Ru&s;h for his Service or his Hazard. This rais'd our Knight's Back up to &s;uch a degree, that he immediately unca&s;es his dead-do|ing Weapon, and crying out, <HI>Villain, let go my Bridle, or el&s;e both thou and all about thee &s;hall fall a Sacrifice to my dire Revenge;</HI> And then lifting up his Sword to cleave his Head a&s;under, the Inn-keeper thought fit to &s;tart a&s;ide to avoid it, and thereupon our Hero rid out at the Gate mangre all their Oppo|&s;ition. But as Ill-luck would have it, left his Squire behind him, who they
<PB N="19" REF="10"> immediately &s;hutting in, demanded the Money of him; but he &s;olemnly averring that he had not &s;o much as one &s;ingle Doit, the Innkeeper re&s;olv'd to have Satisfaction of him another way; and immediately ordering his Maid to fetch a large Blanket, and calling all that were in the Inn about him, poor <HI>Sancho</HI> was pre&s;ently pull'd from his A&s;s and thrown into it, being held up hollow; and then to&s;&s;ing him up aloft, receiv'd him again, &s;prawling like a<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Toad on a Wa&s;hing-block; often holding the Blanket &s;o low, that his very Rump &s;aluted the Pavement; which put them into &s;uch a Laughter, that they neither minded his crying out for Mercy, nor regarded his threatning them with his Ma&s;ter's Revenge; who had the Mortification to &s;ee him, without being able to help him. &mdash; When they had had their full Satisfaction of poor <HI>Sancho,</HI> they &s;et him on his A&s;s again; who, in as bad a plight as he was, was glad he was got out of their Clutches, making &s;o much ha&s;te to be gone, that he quite forgot to take his Wallet along with him, in which was all his Stores and Provi&s;ions. Being got to his Ma&s;ter, he complain'd grievou&s;ly on him for abandoning him to &s;o much Pain and Di&s;grace. His Ma&s;ter told him he thought he had followed him at the Heels; but finding he did not, he came back to take Revenge: But alas! what cou'd he do? He found <HI>Rozi|nante</HI> &s;o inchanted, that he cou'd by no means force him to leap the Barrier, otherwi&s;e he &s;wore by the bright Eyes of his <HI>Dulcinea,</HI> he'd not have left one Soul of 'em alive. This Prote&s;tation was &s;ome Satisfaction to his Squire, and &s;o on they rid on in hopes of meeting with &s;ome more favourable Adventures.</P>

</FIGURE> a Bier with a dead Body lying thereon, which he concluded to be &s;ome vali|ant Knight whom they had Murthered, and were now going to the Moun|tains to conceal it. This Thought being fixt in his Head, he re&s;olved to know the Truth of it; to which end, he rides up to 'em, and without &s;peaking a Word goes to &s;top 'em; but they not minding him, went on their Way, which &s;o irritated our Hero, that he run again&s;t the foremo&s;t and overthew both Man and Mule, by which the Man had his Leg broken, which made him cry out in a lamentable manner for Help, which did &s;o terrifie the other, (which were Church-Men, and a few Friends of the Decea&s;ed, who were going to bury a Gentleman at <HI>Segovia,</HI> and &s;eeing <HI>Sancho</HI> lurk behind, were afraid there were more in his Company) they fled about the Fields in Confu|&s;ion, whil&s;t in the interim, Don <HI>Quixote</HI> examin'd his Pri&s;oner, who hone&s;tly told him the naked Truth of the Matter, which he confirm'd by ki&s;&s;ing the Cro&s;s. Our triumphing Knight, &s;atisfy'd with this Victory, call'd <HI>Sancho</HI> to help him from under his Mule, who had been more bu&s;ily employed than his Ma&s;ter, in rifling of a Sumpter-Mule, where he met with a Wallet much better than that which he had lo&s;t, &s;tuff'd with all &s;orts of good Provi|&s;ions, which he very joyfully laded his A&s;s withal, and then a&s;&s;i&s;ted the fallen Stranger, and help'd him upon his Mule; tho' he wou'd fir&s;t fain have rifled his Pockets, which <HI>Sancho</HI> &s;aid, was the lawful Plunder of the Field; but his Ma&s;ter po&s;itively forbid it, as having &s;et him at Liberty, and pardon'd him. And &s;o they left them to call the Company together, and bury the Dead where they de&s;ign'd. <HI>Sancho</HI> riding off very jollily, as having good &s;tore of Provant along with him. So that now, though they cou'd not meet with an Inn, yet
<PB N="21" REF="12"> they were well enough contented to &s;helter them&s;elves under &s;ome Trees in a Meadow, and there to refre&s;h them&s;elves till the Morning's Dawning.</P>
<P>In the Morning, as they were riding over a Corn-field, it began to rain, Don <HI>Quixote</HI> &s;aw at a di&s;tance, a Man riding on an A&s;s, with &s;omething &s;hining on his Head like Gold, which he would needs have to be the Helmet of <HI>Mambrino,</HI> which was &s;o famous, that it was valu'd at the Price of a Kingdom. And telling what he thought to <HI>Sancho,</HI> they were now come &s;o near him, that <HI>Sancho</HI> &s;aw 'twas nothing but a Barber riding on an A&s;s, who, becau&s;e of the Rain, cover'd his Head with a bra&s;s Ba&s;on. Don <HI>Quixote</HI> was affronted at <HI>Sancho</HI>'s Bluntne&s;s, and told him, he &s;hould quickly &s;ee his Mi|&s;take; and running in a great Fury to meet the Man, cry'd out to him, Ho, Sir <HI>Alifumforon Montarbaton,</HI> thou Pagan Knight, deliver up to me the Hel|met which you have injuriou&s;ly &s;tolen from the renowned <HI>Mambrino,</HI> while he &s;lept; or this All conquering Arm of mine &s;hall &s;oon compel thee to it: The poor Barber (for &s;uch he was, and had been to trim a Man in the adja|cent Village) hearing the threatning Language of a Man in Armour, and not knowing what he meant by it, quitted his A&s;s, and betook him&s;elf to his Heels, and dropping his Ba&s;on in the Fright, fled away to the Mountains for Security. Don <HI>Quixote</HI> immediately order'd <HI>Sancho</HI> to take the Ba&s;on up, and give it him; then taking it in his Hand, and looking earne&s;tly on it. <HI>Ah,</HI> Sancho, &s;aid he, <HI>what an invaluable Jewel &s;hould I have had of this Helmet, had it but been what once it was; but to make it look like a Ba&s;on, they have cut off all the lower part. Why, what is it el&s;e but a Ba&s;on,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Sancho? A Ba&s;on, thou provoking Villain!</HI> reply'd Don <HI>Quixote, I tell thee, 'tis a part of the Helmet of the invincible</HI> Mambrino; <HI>and I will have it fitted up for my own &V;&s;e: Therefore put it up in thy Wallet, and &s;ay no more. I be&s;eech you,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Sancho, let me offer one thing more to your Con&s;ideration, and that is, That &s;ince the Pannel of the Pagan Knight's A&s;s is better than mine, whether the Squire, by the Laws of Knight-Errantry, may not lawfully make an Exchange with him?</HI> The Ca&s;e was very weighty, but after having maturely weigh'd it, Don <HI>Quix|ote</HI> allow'd it might be done. And &s;o the Exchange being made, away they rid together, and they being gone, the poor Barber took his A&s;s, and rid home to tell the Town how he lo&s;t his Ba&s;on.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> to pa&s;s away the time as they rid along, read to his Squire a Lecture of Knight-Errantry, &s;hewing by what Gradation a Knight-Errant mounted to the highe&s;t Pinnacle of Honour, and thereby became capable of advancing their Squires to the Government of Countries, which was what <HI>Sancho</HI> gap'd for, and what his Ma&s;ter had promis'd him, and therefore <HI>San|cho</HI> was very well pleas'd to hear there was any Likelihood of it. This Di&s;|cour&s;e was hardly over, when they perceived coming cro&s;s the High-way a|bout a dozen lu&s;ty young Fellows chained altogether, the Chain being fa&s;ten'd to Iron Collars about their Necks, with four armed Men to guard them. This unu&s;ual Spectale moved our Compa&s;&s;ionate Knight-Errant (who&s;e Employ|ment was to defend the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed) to &s;pur on <HI>Rozinante,</HI> to come up with them; which he did in a little time, and fell to Examine whither tho&s;e Men were driving them in &s;uch a mi&s;erable Condition? They told him to the Gallies, for &s;everal &s;mall Crimes, which they named particulerly,
<PB N="22" REF="13"> their Guard cau&s;ing them to &s;top, in hopes that Don <HI>Quixote</HI> would have given them &s;ome Money. But he under&s;tanding they were compelled to go with 'em, re&s;olutely order'd that they &s;hould be &s;et at Liberty; which the Guards oppo&s;ed, urging the King's Order to carry them on Board. <HI>That &s;ignifies nothing to me,</HI> &s;aid Don <HI>Quixote, my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to vindicate the Oppre&s;&s;ed, aad I'll have it done.</HI> At this the Commi&s;&s;ary that commanded 'em, fell a laughing, but he &s;oon chang'd his Tune; for Don <HI>Quixote</HI> running furiou&s;ly at him with his Lance, throw him down to the Ground, hurting him very much; and was preparing to charge the re&s;t, who were coming &s;o fiercely to attack him, that had not the Thieves broke their Chain, and come in to their Cham|pion's Help, it had gone very hard with him; but they pelting them with their Irons, fled away, and left 'em at Liberty; <HI>Sancho,</HI> in the mean time, bu&s;ied him&s;elf in plun|dering the Commi&s;&s;ary, who lay wounded. Don <HI>Quixote</HI> proud of this Victory, call'd the new-deliver'd Slaves about him, and recounting in a large Oration, what mighty things he had done for them, commanded them in Acknowledgmet thereof, to re|pair in&s;tantly to <HI>Tobo&s;a,</HI> and there on their Knees, with the broken Pieces of Chains in their Hands, acknowledge them&s;elves to be redeem'd from a mi&s;erable Slavery, by the alone Prowe&s;s and matchle&s;s Arm of the ever-pui&s;&s;ant and victorious Knight, Don <HI>Quixote</HI> of the <HI>Mancha.</HI> But they de&s;ir'd to be excus'd, alledging, that their Bu&s;ine&s;s now was, to &s;kulk into the Woods and Mountains, that they may e&s;cape falling into the Hands of the Brotherhood, by whom they &s;hould be in Danger of being take again, &s;hould they travel the Roads. This Refu&s;al of the Slaves to obey his Orders, rais'd up his Back to that degree, that he &s;wore they &s;hould either obey him, or el&s;e he him&s;elf would drive them to the Gallies; by which they perceived him to have a &s;oft place in his Head, and therefore by the Advice of their Ring-Leader, who&s;e Name was <HI>Gives Pa&s;&s;amount,</HI> they ran to a Heap of Stones, from whence they &s;o pelted both our Knight and Squire, that they rid away with all the Speed they cou'd, to pre|vent having tho&s;e little Brains they had being beaten out of their Heads.</P>

Upon this entred the <HI>Afflicted Matron,</HI> and em|braced Don <HI>Quixote</HI>'s Knees, and &s;aid, <HI>I waited on</HI> Donna Maguncia <HI>the Canducian Queen in the farthest Orient, who committed to my Tuition the beautiful Prince&s;s</HI> Antonomo&s;ia, <HI>a Lady of great Beauty; and tho' &s;he was courted by many great Princes, yet the Queen refus'd her Con&s;ent. Now in the Court was one Don</HI> Clani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o, <HI>a Mu&s;ician, who demanded my Con&s;ent to &s;teal away the Prince&s;s; to which I con&s;ented: The Queen no &s;ooner knew he had convey'd her away, but &s;he bani&s;h'd me the Court, and died with Grief. &V;pon her Death, Don</HI> Clanixo, <HI>in the Right of his Prince&s;s, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom. But &s;he was no &s;ooner buried, but Gi|ant</HI> Melambruno, <HI>the decea&s;ed Queen's Cou&s;in, to revenge Don</HI> Clanixo<HI>'s Boldne&s;s, and</HI> Anto|nom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters"><HI>'s Folly, turn'd him into a Crocodil, and her into an Ape, fa&s;t'ning both to the Tomb of her Mother, that they can't be remov'd till the Inchantment's di&s;&s;olv'd, which you only can do.</HI></P>
<P>Don <HI>Quixote</HI> hereupon promis'd to end the Enchantment, by cutting off <HI>Malumbruno</HI>'s Head; but a&s;ked how he &s;hould come at him, &s;ince there was &s;o many va&s;t Seas and De|&s;arts between them? She rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y'd, <HI>That her Squire had &s;tollen the famous</HI> Pacolet<HI>'s Wooden Hor&s;e, who by turning only a Pin in his Forehead, wou'd mount up with his Rider up into the Air, and be at the most di&s;tant Place in a Trice.</HI> And thereupon four Men brought in a Wooden Hor&s;e, who&s;e Feet were fa&s;tned upon Wheels. <HI>Sancho</HI> &s;eeing this &s;trange Device,<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> refus'd to take &s;uch an airy Journey; but Don <HI>Quixote</HI> and the Duke and Dutche&s;s over-per&s;waded him, with the Promi&s;e of an I&s;land, on the fini&s;hing this Adventure. So that being agreed, they were both blind-folded to prevent their Heads from &s;wimming in pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;o many Regions. Being fix'd upon the wooden Hor&s;e, there was &s;ome ap|pointed to run him about upon a &s;mooth &s;andy Walk; and blowing with a Pair Bellows in their Faces, <HI>I perceive,</HI> &s;aid Don <HI>Quixote, we are already in the Region where Ice and Snow are engender'd: I believe &s;o,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Sancho, for 'tis plaguy cold.</HI> Then a great many Crackers were let off: <HI>Now,</HI> Sancho, &s;aid Don <HI>Quixote, hear how the Thunder roars, and fiery Bolts rattle and hi&s;s in the Clouds.</HI> Then putting Fire to the Hor&s;e's Tail, a great Number of Crackers that were in his Belly, blew him up into the Air, which canted the two Hor&s;emen into a Fountain: Upon which a doleful Cry was made, <HI>He flies, he dies by the valiant Hand of the Knight of</HI> Mancha. This Voice they heard as they were &s;cram|bling out of the Water. Being unhoodwink'd, they were congratulated for having fi|ni&s;h'd the Adventure, and being de&s;ir'd to take &s;ome Re&s;t after it; were convey'd to Bed, a &s;leepy Portion was given 'em, and they were remov'd into a Cart, and &s;ent home to the Village of the <HI>Mancha;</HI> where Don <HI>Quixote</HI> &s;oon after repented him of his Follies, and ended his Days.</P>
