<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been none of the lea&s;t Arti|fices
of tho&s;e of the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>Rome,</HI> to recommend their <HI>Re|ligion</HI>
to the World, by denying
a great part of tho&s;e <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> which
the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> have charged upon it;
<PB REF="3">
and a&s;cribing that to the meer <HI>Inven|tion</HI>
of their <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> which at
the &s;ame time all, who have ever lived
in tho&s;e <HI>Countries</HI> in which <HI>Popery</HI>
prevails, cannot but know, is every Day
practi&s;ed among them.</P>
<P>I am &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible how little
need there is for Me to &s;ay any thing
in An&s;wer to this <HI>Pretence,</HI> which has
been &s;o fully and &s;olidly Confuted in
&s;o many Learned <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> as the
late Times produc'd upon this very
<HI>Argument:</HI> And which ought to make
them for ever a&s;hamed of &s;uch <HI>Expo|&s;itions</HI>
and <HI>Repre&s;entations</HI> of their
<HI>Doctrin,</HI> as &s;hew rather what the <HI>Au|thors</HI>
of them would have their <HI>Reli|gion</HI>
thought to be, than what indeed
it is. But yet having had &s;ome Oppor|tunities
by my long <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI>
among them, to <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> more, and
penetrate farther into their <HI>My&s;teries,</HI>
<PB REF="3">
than Tho&s;e who have been always
<HI>Strangers</HI> to their <HI>Communion</HI> can
well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have done; I
thought it might not be altogether &V;&s;e|le&s;s
to Communicate my <HI>Reflections</HI>
to the World; and &s;hew what <HI>Popery</HI>
is not in the &s;mooth <HI>De&s;criptions</HI> of
De&s;igning Men, but in the Open <HI>Pra|ctice</HI>
and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of it, in tho&s;e
<HI>Countries</HI> where they Act without <HI>Di&s;|gui&s;e,</HI>
and look upon them&s;elves to be
the true&s;t and mo&s;t Zealous Ob&s;ervers
of it.</P>
<P>This, My <HI>Lord,</HI> was my De&s;ign in
Publi&s;hing the following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es:</HI>
And it is this that emboldens me with
all Humility to pre&s;ent them to Your
<HI>Grace,</HI> who is &s;o great a <HI>Judge,</HI> and &s;o
proper a <HI>Patron</HI> of &s;uch an <HI>Under|taking.</HI></P>
<P>It is, My <HI>Lord,</HI> Your Honour to
Govern a <HI>Church,</HI> than which none has
<PB REF="4">
ever approved it &s;elf more firm to the
<HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t;</HI> or better de&s;erved
to be e&s;teem'd, what by all &V;nder&s;tand|ing
Men it is allow'd to be, the &s;tronge&s;t
<HI>Bulwark</HI> again&s;t <HI>Popery.</HI> But it is
much more, &s;o to have been thought
worthy of &s;uch a Station, by <HI>Princes</HI> &s;o
<HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cerning,</HI> and &s;o affectio|nately
concern'd for the <HI>Churches</HI> Good.
And it ought not to be wondred, if all
Men de&s;ire his <HI>Patronage,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Ver|tues</HI>
are no le&s;s <HI>Illu&s;trious</HI> than His
<HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> this was not all the
Rea&s;on I had, for de&s;iring to prefix &s;o
<HI>Great a Name</HI> to my Pre&s;ent &V;nder|taking.
I am well aware, that in the
following <HI>Relations</HI> many things will
occur which may perhaps appear a little
Strange to the <HI>Vulgar Reader,</HI> and will
hardly gain Credit with tho&s;e who do not
know how great the <HI>Extravagances</HI> of
<PB REF="4">
Tho&s;e of the <HI>Other Communion</HI> are,
when they act freely, and according
to the true <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Genius</HI> of
their <HI>Religion.</HI> And <HI>Travellers,</HI> as
well as <HI>Poets,</HI> are commonly look'd
upon to be <HI>priviledg'd Per&s;ons;</HI>
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;et off their <HI>Sto|ries</HI>
to the be&s;t advantage, and e&s;peci|ally
when they write to &s;uch as they
think are not able to confute their Pre|tences.
But I hope when it &s;hall be
con&s;ider'd to whom I have adventur'd
to pre&s;ent the&s;e <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> no man
will after that pre&s;ume to Que&s;tion
the <HI>fidelity</HI> of them; Or think I
&s;hould have dur&s;t to intitule your
<HI>Grace</HI> to any thing that I was not
&s;ure would bear the &s;tricte&s;t Exami|nation.</P>
<P>May it therefore plea&s;e your <HI>Grace</HI>
who have &s;o often and Gloriou&s;ly tri|umph'd
over the <HI>Errors</HI> of the
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> in your own <HI>Writ|ings,</HI>
now to give a new force, by the
<HI>Authority</HI> of your <HI>Name,</HI> to what
is here produc'd again&s;t them. A
<HI>Name</HI> as Venerable to all true <HI>lov|ers</HI>
of their <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI>
as Terrible to Tho&s;e who bear a &s;e|cret
<HI>Enmity</HI> to Either; and know
both how well Able your <HI>Grace</HI> is,
and how Vigorous they have rea&s;on
to fear you will be, to di&s;cover and
defeat their de&s;igns again&s;t both.
And may that God, who has been
plea&s;ed to rai&s;e up &s;o great a <HI>&s;up|port</HI>
to his <HI>Church,</HI> at a time when
it never more &s;tood in need of the
<HI>Wi&s;e&s;t Conduct,</HI> long continue to

on <HI>Earth,</HI> tran&s;late you to a more
<HI>Exceeding and Eternal weight of

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I Publi&s;h'd my LETTERS
the la&s;t Year, concerning <HI>The Frauds
of Romi&s;h Monks and Prie&s;ts;</HI> I was in &s;ome
mea&s;ure re&s;olved not to have troubled the
World with any more of the&s;e kind of
Writings: And could have been very well
contented to have given thereby a fair Oc|ca&s;ion
to tho&s;e of that <HI>Religion</HI> to commend
my <HI>Moderation.</HI> But my former <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI>
having met with a reception beyond what
I dur&s;t have promi&s;ed my &s;elf; and &s;everal
of my <HI>Friends,</HI> for whom I have a very
ju&s;t E&s;teem, flattering me, That it would
not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s for me to &s;uffer
the re&s;t of my <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> to &s;ee the light:
I thought I could not do better than in
following their Advice; and that I ought
rather by this means to te&s;tifie my Zeal for
the <HI>Reform'd Religion,</HI> than to gratifie the
Humors of the <HI>Contrary Party,</HI> by refu&s;ing
<PB REF="6">
their <HI>De&s;ires.</HI> I do not think, that in any
thing of this I can ju&s;tly be charged to
have exceeded the <HI>Bounds of Charity;</HI> &s;eeing
I am &s;ure I have kept my &s;elf with great
exactne&s;s, within tho&s;e of <HI>Truth:</HI> And upon
all Occa&s;ions cho&s;en rather to &s;ay <HI>too little,</HI>
than <HI>too much.</HI></P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much concerning the
Occa&s;ion of my <HI>Publi&s;hing</HI> the following
<HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> I mu&s;t in the next place de&s;ire the
<HI>Reader</HI> to &s;top &s;o long as while I take no|tice
of an <HI>Objection,</HI> which I am told has
been made again&s;t my <HI>former Book.</HI> In my
<HI>VIIIth</HI> LETTER, <HI>pag. 398.</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and
<HI>&s;econd Editions,</HI> I related a &s;ingular In&s;tance
of the liberties which the <HI>Monks</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>
allow them&s;elves in their <HI>Intriegues</HI> with
<HI>Ladies.</HI> There is it &s;eems a certain <HI>Gentle|man</HI>
in the World, who having an extraor|dinary
Zeal for the Truth, and it may be to
render &s;ome &s;ervice to tho&s;e of the <HI>Other
Religion,</HI> has been willing to take upon
him&s;elf the &s;candalous <HI>Adventure</HI> which is
there recounted. He pretends that it hapned
whil&s;t he was at <HI>Venice,</HI> and that him&s;elf
was the very Per&s;on concern'd in it. And
from thence would have it thought, that I
<PB REF="7">
take up the &s;tories of the <HI>Vices</HI> and <HI>Extra|vagances</HI>
of <HI>Lay-men,</HI> and put them upon the
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Monks</HI> of the <HI>Romi&s;h Church,</HI>
only to render them thereby the more
Odious.</P>
<P>It is not my de&s;ign to rob this <HI>Gentleman</HI>
of the Honour of &s;uch a Rencounter. But I
mu&s;t needs intreat the <HI>Reader</HI> to remember
what I have before Remark'd in &s;everal
places of tho&s;e <HI>Letters,</HI> that the <HI>Stories</HI> I
tell, are no extraordinary Events, but things
that happen frequently and ordinarily in
tho&s;e <HI>Countries,</HI> where <HI>Popery</HI> reigns in its
full liberty. And therefore that it ought not
to be inferr'd, that becau&s;e &s;uch an <HI>Adventure</HI>
hapned to this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> therefore it did
not al&s;o happen to the <HI>Monk</HI> of whom I
there &s;peak. This I am &s;ure, that the <HI>Monk</HI>
boa&s;ted of it to me, as he was going to &s;ay
<HI>Ma&s;s;</HI> and if occa&s;ion were, I could tell
above VII or VIII <HI>Stories</HI> more of the like
nature; but that I fear I &s;hould tire out
my <HI>Reader</HI> with &s;o many <HI>Relations</HI> to the
&s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Fir&s;t Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>I Departed from <HI>Rome</HI> the 6th of <HI>May,</HI>
in the Year of our Lord 1686, and by
chance joyn'd Company with an Aged
<HI>Neapolitan</HI> Abbot, who was going to <HI>Vel&eacute;tre.</HI>
He was a Man throughly vers'd in the Poli|ticks
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had been Secretary to
&s;everal Cardinals. And fora&s;much as I had
<PB N="2" REF="14">
already conceived a &s;ufficient aver&s;ion for the
Romi&s;h Religion, the Corruption whereof I
had a fair occa&s;ion to di&s;cover during my
long abode in <HI>Italy,</HI> I was very de&s;irous to
under&s;tand the Sentiments of a Per&s;on of &s;o
great Age and Experience. Wherefore after
having di&s;cour&s;ed him about indifferent Mat|ters,
I in&s;en&s;ibly put him upon the Point of
the Capacity and Learning of the Clergy of
<HI>Rome.</HI> He &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied me on that
Subject; and in the Account he gave me, he
ob&s;erved &s;omething of a Method: For in the
fir&s;t place, he &s;poke to me of the Head of
that Church, <HI>viz.</HI> the POPE; and from
him pa&s;&s;ed to the Principal Members thereof,
which are the CARDINALS, the ARCH|BISHOPS,
and ABBOTS, and concluded
his Di&s;cour&s;e with the Common PRIESTS
and MONKS.</P>
<P>As for the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I mean the Pope,
he told me, That it was a lamentable thing
to &s;ee in what gro&s;s Ignorance many Popes
lived, of the mo&s;t important Truths of the
Chri&s;tian Religion; and that he him&s;elf had
been fain to inform Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the <HI>Xth,</HI> of <HI>the
true &s;en&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;age of the Creed,</HI> Qui con|ceptus
e&s;t de Spiritu Sancto, <HI>who was conceived
by the Holy Ghost;</HI> for he in&s;tead of under|&s;tanding
them of the Temporal Conception,
in the My&s;tery of the Incarnation, did attri|bute
them to the Eternal Generation of the
Word; and according to his Apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="3" REF="14">
the&s;e Words, <HI>[Who was conceived by the Holy
Gho&s;t, born of the Virgin</HI> Mary,] afforded this
meaning: <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was Conceived
from all Eternity by the Holy Spirit, was Born in
time of the Virgin</HI> Mary. So that if this Pope
&s;hould have undertaken to have determin'd
the Sen&s;e of them according to his Notion,
he would have given us a fine In&s;tance of his
Infallibility. His Succe&s;&s;or wi&s;h'd the &s;ame
Abbot to Explain to him the Nature of Origi|nal
Sin, and how the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin came to
be exempt from it.</P>
<P>Now it is worth our Ob&s;ervation, that they
were ju&s;t the&s;e very Popes, the mo&s;t Ignorant
that of a long time had appeared in the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> who undertook to decide the mo&s;t
important Controver&s;ie which ever was deter|min'd
in the Church &s;ince the Council of <HI>Trent;</HI>
the Propugnators of the Efficacious Grace of
S. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> being of one &s;ide, and the Defenders
of Sufficient Grace on the other; I mean, the
Di&s;pute was maintain'd between the <HI>Augu&s;ti|nians</HI>
or <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts,</HI> and the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> otherwi&s;e
call'd <HI>Molini&s;ts.</HI> The former of the&s;e two
Popes had at the fir&s;t no great mind to deter|mine
any thing concerning tho&s;e Points:
For he declared one day to <HI>Luke</HI> of <HI>Holstein,</HI>
his Library-Keeper, That the Solicitations he
had from <HI>France,</HI> to pronounce his deci&s;ion
concerning the Propo&s;itions of <HI>Jan&s;enius,</HI>
drawn from S. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> gave him a great deal
of Trouble, becau&s;e the Que&s;tion was con|cerning
<PB N="4" REF="15">
Points that he did not under&s;tand,
neither had he ever &s;tudied them. <HI>Luke</HI> of
<HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> an&s;wer'd him, That his Holine&s;s
would do well not to begin at the Age he
was of, to trouble him&s;elf about the under|&s;tanding,
and much le&s;s about the deciding
of them; becau&s;e they were very perplex and
intricate of them&s;elves; and that they had not
only been the occa&s;ion of great Di&s;putes
among&s;t the Chri&s;tians, but al&s;o among&s;t the
greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers of Ancient Times; by
rea&s;on of the difficulty they found, to recon|cile
the Liberty of Mans Will with the De|crees
and Fore-knowledge of God, where|upon
&s;ome of them embraced one Opinion,
Others, another; as was done &s;till to this day,
and would &s;o continue as long as there &s;hould
be Men in the World. Whence he inferr'd,
That fora&s;much as it was impo&s;&s;ible for him
to pronounce a deci&s;ion that might &s;atisfie
both Parties, it would be better for him not
to meddle with it at all, but to leave things
in the &s;tate he found them till they &s;hould
drop of them&s;elves, as they would without
doubt, whenever the one or other Party (or
both of them together) &s;hould be weary of
the Di&s;puting, and forcing their Opinions
upon their Antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, The Pope was extreamly plea&s;ed
with this Advice. In the mean time it was
ob&s;erv'd, that by his frequent A&s;&s;i&s;ting at
many Congregations which were held on this
<PB N="5" REF="15">
Subject, he at la&s;t took a great deal of plea&s;ure
to hear the&s;e different Doctrins di&s;cu&s;t, not|with&s;tanding
the great Repugnance he had
for them at the fir&s;t; and he attributed this
change in him&s;elf, to an extraordinary a&s;&s;i|&s;tance
of the Holy Spirit. On a time the
Lady <HI>Olympia,</HI> his Si&s;ter, asked him, <HI>What
Matters were treated of in tho&s;e Congregations,
that were &s;o very plea&s;ing to his Holine&s;s?</HI> The
Pope An&s;wer'd, That <HI>they were certain Sub|tilties
which &s;he did not under&s;tand; but that pro|bably
&s;he might come to comprehend them, in ca&s;e
&s;he were pre&s;ent there whil&s;t one of the Con&s;ulters
Di&s;cour&s;ed, who explain'd tho&s;e Points with the
greate&s;t clearne&s;s and per&s;picuity.</HI> In a word, All
the&s;e Con&s;ultations were held on purpo&s;e, to
give his Holine&s;s a true Notion of the&s;e Points
in que&s;tion. But it &s;eems to me, that per&s;ons
who pretend to <HI>Infallibility,</HI> ought to be in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Key of Knowledge,</HI> or at lea&s;t
do their utmo&s;t endeavour to obtain it: For
can any thing be imagin'd more ridiculous,
than that a Pope, to whom Application is
made by the whole Church, for the ratifica|tion
of the Doctrins of Faith, &s;hould be fain
to treat with others, and to demand time and
opportunity to inform him&s;elf, by con&s;ulting
his Doctors; and afterwards hear him tell you,
That the very &s;ame Point of Doctrin, which
a while ago he was ignorant of, is an infal|lible
Truth, and which he alone hath the Au|thority
to determin?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="16">
I entreated the Abbot to tell me in good
earne&s;t, Whether he him&s;elf, who had been
witne&s;s of &s;o much Weakne&s;s and Ignorance
in tho&s;e who are &s;eated in S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chair, could
receive all their Deci&s;ions for Infallible? To
which he An&s;wer'd, That he rather believ'd
them &s;uch by a Faith of his Will, than by a
Faith of Under&s;tanding. I reque&s;ted him to
explain this di&s;tinction, which &s;eem'd to me
to be &s;omewhat ob&s;ure, and in which I &s;aw
that he plac'd &s;omething of My&s;tery. He
told me, That the Faith of Under&s;tanding
carried along with it &s;ome kind of Evidence,
that its Motives were &s;o agreeable with the
Principles of Rea&s;on, or had &s;o clo&s;e a depen|dance
upon Matters revealed, that they could
not be re&s;i&s;ted without acting contrary to
good &s;en&s;e; and that by this Intellectual Faith,
we believe there is a God, and that this God
mu&s;t be feared and wor&s;hipped; That he will
reward tho&s;e that are Good, and puni&s;h the
Wicked; That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Saviour of
the World, foretold by the Prophets, &amp;c. But
as for the Faith of the Will (continued he)
that is altogether ob&s;cure, we find nothing in
it to &s;atisfie our Rea&s;on, and we believe it only,
becau&s;e we will believe it. 'Tis by this Faith
(&s;aid he) that I believe the Infallibility of the
Pope, and a va&s;t number of other things. I
indeed can find nothing that in a human way
can per&s;wade me of the Truth of them; but
at the &s;ame time do perceive in my Soul a
<PB N="7" REF="16">
&s;ecret Bya&s;s &s;waying my Will to believe them;
and this Bya&s;s or &s;ecret Inclination is nothing
el&s;e, but that Bapti&s;mal Grace which is infu&s;ed
into all Chri&s;tians at their Bapti&s;m. I perceived
that this good Abbot took that for a <HI>Bapti&s;mal
Grace,</HI> which indeed is no other than an
Inclination proceeding from Education, and
which di&s;po&s;eth him as much to Error as to
Truth, according to the anticipations this In|clination,
be it good or evil, hath formed in us.
Moreover, at this rate of Arguing he was
oblig'd to believe, (after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner)
That the Prote&s;tants are no Chri&s;tians; for
granting their Bapti&s;m to be good and effe|ctual,
they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the &s;ame
Grace infus'd, di&s;po&s;ing them to believe the
Popes to be Infallible.</P>
<P>Behold here the wonderful Engin that is
made u&s;e of at <HI>Rome,</HI> to tye the Papi&s;ts to their
Good Behaviour; and this was the &s;um of all
the goodly Satisfaction the Grand Penitentiaries
of <HI>Rome</HI> could give me during the abode I
made among&s;t them. I went often to Con|fe&s;&s;ion
to them about &s;ome Doubts that rack'd
my Con&s;cience, with re&s;pect to the Point of
<HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> in hopes to rid my &s;elf of
them. When I told them, That my Rea&s;on
ro&s;e in perfect oppo&s;ition to it: They an&s;wer'd,
That I ought not to hearken to it: And
when I reply'd, That it was every whit as
impo&s;&s;ible for me to go contrary to my Rea|&s;on,
as to believe it Midnight at High-Noon:
<PB N="8" REF="17">
They had recour&s;e to their la&s;t Shift, which
was, to demand of me, Whether I was not
really &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ecret Motion which in|clin'd
me to a willingne&s;s of believing that,
which according to Rea&s;on &s;eem'd incredible
to me: To which I an&s;wer'd, That indeed I
&s;hould find my &s;elf &s;omewhat moved, if any
one &s;hould go about, to force me immediately
to abjure Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; but withal told
them, That this might as well proceed from a
Habit I had acquired, and from tho&s;e Opinions
which the Romi&s;h Religion had in&s;till'd into
me: But they always ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in
a&s;&s;uring me, That the cau&s;e of this difficulty in
the practice of what my Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on
&s;eem'd to lead me to, did not at all proceed
from what I imagin'd, but indeed from that
Habit of Faith, which had been infu&s;ed into me
in my Bapti&s;in, and which then did operate in
me, as it always doth in time of danger, and
when there is any likelyhood of falling under
&s;ome grand Temptation. And when this &s;ort
of People have once declar'd their Judgment,
upon a Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience, you mu&s;t believe
them, or at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ure them, that you &s;ubmit
to their Rea&s;onings; for otherwi&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding
all the Noi&s;e is made about the Secret
of Confe&s;&s;ion, they would &s;oon find means to
oblige you to a very uncomfortable Pa&s;time,
by lodging you in the Inqui&s;ition before you
ever could be aware of it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17">
I &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to inform my
Reader further concerning their Confe&s;&s;ions,
and therefore for the pre&s;ent &s;hall continue to
relate what this Abbot declar'd to me about the
Ignorance of the Clergy of <HI>Rome.</HI> For after
having di&s;cours'd of the Popes at the rate I
have told you, he pa&s;&s;ed over to the <HI>Cardi|nals,</HI>
whom he di&s;tingui&s;h'd into three Cla&s;&s;es.
The fir&s;t was of tho&s;e, who are rai&s;ed to that
Dignity at the &s;olicitation of Princes, and to
favour the Intere&s;t of Crowns: The&s;e are
either Princes them&s;elves, or great States-men,
who&s;e entire &s;tudy con&s;i&s;ts in advancing their
own glory, or that of their Ma&s;ters, and who
have other Fi&s;h to fry, than to break their
Heads with the &s;tudy of Philo&s;ophy, or Divi|nity.
The &s;econd &s;ort of Cardinals, are tho&s;e
who are beholding for their promotion to the
good luck they have had of being the Nephew,
near Relation, or Friend of &s;ome Pope. It's
of &s;mall concern to the&s;e, whether they be
Learned, or not; for tho' the Nephew or
Friend of a Pope &s;hould chance to be the
mo&s;t Ignorant per&s;on in the World, he needs
not fear that this will prove the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle
to him in arriving at the Sacred Purple; (for
the <HI>Ode&s;calci's,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Popes that
abhor Nepoti&s;m, are very &s;carce nowadays)
and indeed Experience teacheth us, that the&s;e
&s;ort of People are commonly at a very low
ebb of any extraordinary Attainments. La&s;tly,
The third Cla&s;&s;is of Cardinals con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e,
<PB N="10" REF="18">
who have di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves among&s;t
the Crowd by &s;ome Talent, that hath made
them to be taken notice of above others. Thus
we meet with &s;ome Preachers, who having
got the knack of that Ability, after the <HI>Italian</HI>
manner, do arrive to this high Degree of
Honour, as likewi&s;e &s;ome Generals of Orders,
and &s;ome Bi&s;hops of the mo&s;t refined Parts
and Accompli&s;hments. Now in this very la&s;t
rank (continued the Abbot) we meet with
&s;ome per&s;ons that pretend to be Learned, tho'
to &s;peak truth, there's very little of any exce&s;s
of it to be found in them; for if you come
once to pre&s;s them home upon &s;ome Points,
you &s;oon find the dimen&s;ions of their Know|ledge,
and that it bears &s;mall proportion with
the Conceit they have of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>All the World knows, that the Cardinals
are the Pope's Grand Council, and the very
per&s;ons who are his A&s;&s;i&s;tants in con&s;tituting
tho&s;e Decrees, which afterwards become the
<HI>Dogma's</HI> of the Papi&s;ts. When it happens
therefore that an Ignorant Pope fills the Chair,
and that his Cardinals partake of the &s;ame
Qualification, what can be hoped for, as the
re&s;ult of all their Con&s;ultations, but Ignorance?
It was ob&s;erved, that at the Congregation
which was granted to &s;ome Doctors of the
<HI>Sorbonne,</HI> who were come to <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;olicit
the Condemnation of <HI>Jan&s;enius</HI> his Propo&s;iti|ons,
all the Cardinals who were Commi&s;&s;ioned
to hear them, very fairly took a Nap upon it;
<PB N="11" REF="18">
whereupon one of the Con&s;ultors finding them
all in that po&s;ture, could not refrain him&s;elf
from reflecting upon it, by &s;aying to one of his
Colleagues, <HI>Al meno &s;e fo&s;&s;e qualcheduno che fa|ce&s;&s;e
la Sentinella; At least there &s;hould have been
one to &s;tand Sentinel the while.</HI> One of the
<HI>Jan&s;eni&s;t</HI> Deputies makes this Reflection upon
it; <HI>But whether they Nodded</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>or were
awake, the manner of their managing of things
upon the Information of One Party only, was very
in&s;ufficient to inform them of the Points they were
to determine. This is that which made us often
to lock upon the Condition of the&s;e Cardinals with
the Eyes of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, who having (for
the mo&s;t part,) &s;pent their Lives in Employments
rather Secular, than Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; and being be|&s;ides
over&s;tock'd with Bu&s;ine&s;s, do notwith&s;tanding
find them&s;elves engaged to declare their own Sen|timents,
and to form that of the Popes about the
mo&s;t knotty and intricate Questions that can be
met with in all Theology; and of which no Judg|ment
can be given without ra&s;hne&s;s, if a Man
have not taken care aforehand, to inform him&s;elf
concerning them by an exact, a&s;&s;iduous, calm, and
compos'd Reading of the Scriptures and Fathers.</HI>
Here it is indeed that the Abbot (my Fellow-Traveller)
had &s;till more rea&s;on to exerci&s;e his
Faith of the Will, or to &s;peak more plainly,
his blind Faith, to induce to believe, That the&s;e
Men (in &s;pight of all their Ignorance and
Negligence) could pronounce nothing but
Words of Life and Eternal Truth. Nay, what
<PB N="12" REF="19">
is more, he believ'd, that the more ignorant
they were, the more the Holy Gho&s;t was
plea&s;ed to &s;peak by their Mouths: For the
Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> he had formed, in de&s;cribing to me
the great Ignorance of the Conductors of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> was not &s;o much to under|value
them, as to exalt the profound Secrets
of the Wi&s;dom of God, who formerly having
made u&s;e of poor Fi&s;her-men, that had no
acquired Parts or Learning wherewith to con|found
the Wi&s;e-men of the World in the
Preaching of the Go&s;pel, did &s;till continue to
make u&s;e of the&s;e poor Ignorant Souls, the
Pope and his Cardinals, to maintain the Truth
of the &s;ame Go&s;pel, again&s;t the fal&s;e Wi&s;dom,
and &s;eeming Doctrin of Hereticks. The Zeal
wherewith he urg'd this Sy&s;tem of his, &s;eem'd
to me to be &s;omewhat extravagant, for he
proportionably extended the &s;ame to all Bi&s;hops,
Curats, and Monks; in a word, to all the
Clergy of <HI>Rome,</HI> whom (in a manner) he dipt
in the &s;ame Sawce, treating them as &s;o many
A&s;&s;es and <HI>Ignoramus's.</HI> I told him, That I
had conver&s;ed with &s;everal Per&s;ons of Wit
and Parts, who according to the Principles of
the Doctrin of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> did Rea|&s;on
tolerably well, and that &s;ome Indulgence
ought to be allowed them in this Point, becau&s;e
the Doctrin of <HI>Rome</HI> was expo&s;ed to abundance
of Contrarieties, which it was not an ea&s;ie
Task to reconcile: As for Example, That Ac|cidents
are &s;eparable from the Sub&s;tance, and
<PB N="13" REF="19">
exi&s;t without a Subject; That one Body can
at the &s;ame time be in &s;everal places; and a
va&s;t number of &s;uch like Ab&s;urdities, which
they are fain to maintain in defence of their
My&s;tery of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</HI> However, not|with&s;tanding
all that I could &s;ay to him, he
per&s;i&s;ted always in his Opinion; and tho' he
appear'd to me &s;omewhat too rigorous, yet
I cannot &s;ay, that he was altogether unju&s;t
in his Cen&s;ure. For if the manner and me|thod
of ordering ones Studies be the mea&s;ure
of the Knowledge one acquires, I don't believe
there is a Country in the World where their
Studies are wor&s;e conducted, than in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
where con&s;equently there mu&s;t needs be le&s;s
Learning than there.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be unplea&s;ing to my
Readers, if I pre&s;ent them with a view of the
Particulars thereof.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, The <HI>Italians</HI> have too
much Indulgence for their Children, and the
fear they have of putting them upon any
thing that might be too laborious for them in
their Tender years, makes them have no
thoughts of putting them to School, till very
late. They ordinarily keep them two or
three Years in the Inferior Schools, where
they only learn to Read and Write <HI>Italian;</HI>
and a Boy, who at the Age of Twelve Years
begins to Read and Write, is already look'd
upon as forward enough in his Studies.
Afterwards they change their Ma&s;ters, and are
<PB N="14" REF="20">
&s;ent to a Latin School, where they &s;pend two
or three years more only in learning the fir&s;t Ru|diments
of Grammar, and &s;ome Latin words to
di&s;po&s;e them for the pro&s;ecuting of their Stu|dies
with the Je&s;uits. The&s;e Fathers have al|mo&s;t
engro&s;t all the publick Colleges in all the
Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> as making a mo&s;t particular
Profe&s;&s;ion of in&s;tructing Youth. But in the
mean time experience teacheth, that God &s;el|dom
accompanies their undertakings with his
Ble&s;&s;ing, and that indeed they are the very
Men, notwith&s;tanding all the Noi&s;e they make
to the contrary, who make Youth to lo&s;e
their time. For in the fir&s;t place they chu&s;e
young Je&s;uits to be their Ma&s;ters or Regents of
their Scholars, who&s;e wit is not yet &s;etled, and
who are not &s;ufficiently grounded them&s;elves
in the Latin Tongue, &s;o that it is in a manner
impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be capable of in&s;truct|ing
others. But the de&s;ign of the Society
herein is, that the&s;e young Je&s;uits <HI>may perfect
them&s;elves in their Latin by teaching others,</HI> ac|cording
to that Maxim, <HI>Optimus modus Di&s;cen|di,
e&s;t Docendi; the best of Learning, is that of
Teaching.</HI> This method is indeed for the pro|fit
of the Ma&s;ters, but is as di&s;advantageous to
the Scholars; whereas when tho&s;e that teach
others are already perfect in their Art, and
skill'd in all the ways and turnings of it; this is
a great advantage to the Scholars, and a kind
of lo&s;s of time for the Ma&s;ters, who learn no|thing
by teaching others, but what they are al|ready
<PB N="15" REF="20">
perfectly acquainted with: That it is
a very ill boding for the Scholars, to &s;ee the&s;e
young Je&s;uits take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ma&s;ters
Chairs, who are not able to explain an Author
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why the Scholars advance
&s;o little under the Conduct of the Je&s;uits, is,
becau&s;e the&s;e Fathers being too great Lovers of
their plea&s;ures, give too much leave for Pa&s;time
to their Scholars. They have two whole days
leave to play in every Week, <HI>viz.</HI> Tue&s;day
and Thur&s;day, without reckoning the extra|ordinary
days of Vacation; for when-ever
the Weather is fair and inviting to walk a|broad,
it is a very hard Task to keep a Je&s;uit
within Doors. The young Regents addre&s;s
them&s;elves to the Rector or Provincial, and
are &s;o importunate with them for leave to take
their Recreation, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to de|ny
them. And be&s;ides all this, the Holy-days
are &s;o frequent in <HI>Italy,</HI> that &s;ometimes you
meet with three or four in one Week. More|over,
every year in Autumn they have two
Months of vacancy; &s;o that all this being
well con&s;idered and laid together, we &s;hall
find but a &s;mall proportion of time left for
Study. The Youth, as every where el&s;e, are
very well pleas'd with it, tho' &s;ooner or later
they are made &s;en&s;ible of the bad effects of it;
for ignorant they come to the Je&s;uits, and ig|norant
they leave them; and having lo&s;t the
mo&s;t precious part of their time, they for the
<PB N="16" REF="21">
mo&s;t part continue Ignorants all the re&s;t of
their Lives. Neither is this all, that there are
only a few days allotted for Study, but al&s;o
very few hours in tho&s;e few days; for the
Morning School only la&s;ts two hours, and the
Afternoon an hour and an half. Some Je&s;uits
have endeavoured to maintain to me, that it
was not po&s;&s;ible in <HI>Italy</HI> to &s;tudy for a longer
time together: But as to that I an&s;wered them,
that I had continued my Lectures four hours
together in the Morning, and three in the Af|ternoon,
when I taught at <HI>Milan,</HI> in the Abby
of Great St. <HI>Victor;</HI> and that my Scholars, who
were all of them <HI>Italians,</HI> became at length
accu&s;tom'd to it. Thus I made it appear, that
they had no lawful excu&s;e for their carele&s;ne&s;s
and neglect, and that it was only their love of
plea&s;ure and idlene&s;s, that had reduc'd Study
to the condition in which it was. Again, of
the&s;e few hours that are de&s;tinated for In|&s;truction,
there are but few moments employ'd
as they ought. The&s;e young Je&s;uits are never
unfurni&s;ht of &s;ome ridiculous conceit, or &s;tory
to tell their Scholars to &s;horten the time; and
'tis obvious for them to &s;tart occa&s;ions of Mirth
and Pa&s;time, when ever they plea&s;e, amid&s;t
that great number of Scholars that &s;urround
them. But of all the time they &s;quander away,
there's none lo&s;t with a more &s;pecious pretext,
than that which they be&s;tow upon Declama|tions,
whereby they endeavour to di&s;po&s;e and
fit their Scholars to appear with applau&s;e upon
their Theaters.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="21">
The Je&s;uits take much pains them&s;elves in
making of Comedies and Tragedies, and e|very
Regent is bound to compo&s;e two at lea&s;t
every year. To this end as &s;oon as they have
fini&s;hed &s;ome piece of Elaborate Folly or Bou|fonery,
they di&s;tribute the Per&s;onages thereof,
to tho&s;e of their Scholars they judge mo&s;t
proper to repre&s;ent them, and they &s;pend a
great part of the time of their Cla&s;&s;es or Mor|ning
and Afternoon Lectures in exerci&s;ing
them two or three months before the Drama
is to be acted publickly. This lo&s;s of time
would not be altogether &s;o great, in ca&s;e the&s;e
Comedies or Tragedies were in the Latin
Tongue; but excepting only &s;ome few &s;prink|lings
of Latin words here and there, they are
all <HI>Italian.</HI> Their end herein is to make them
the more Intelligible to the Ladies that are
invited to them. Among&s;t the re&s;t they take
care not to forget the Mothers of their Scho|lars,
who are ravi&s;hed to &s;ee their Children
declaming upon the Theater of the Reverend
Fathers the Je&s;uits; and conceit their Chil|dren
have profited greatly, in being &s;o dex|trous
at playing the Jack-Pudding. Neither is all
this ado without &s;ome profit to the Reverend
Fathers, for this gives them an occa&s;ion of put|ting
their Scholars upon a liberal Contributi|on
towards the Decoration of their Theaters
and Machines.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="22">
There are many <HI>Italians</HI> who are very &s;en|&s;ible
of the lo&s;s of their Childrens time, cau&s;ed
by the&s;e methods of the Je&s;uits; but they are
fain to &s;mothet it, not daring to mention the
lea&s;t word of it to them; for if they &s;hould,
they would pre&s;ently call them ingrateful, as
not acknowledging the favour that is done
them in teaching their Children <HI>gratis,</HI> and
after the&s;e reproaches would not fail &s;hameful|ly
to expel them their Colledge.</P>
<P>I cannot but take notice here, with what
a &s;tock of Impudence the Je&s;uits pretend and
boa&s;t them&s;elves to teach Youth for nothing;
for indeed every City, where they have their
Schools, provides a Fund that is more than
&s;ufficient to maintain them, and this Mony is
rai&s;ed by new Impo&s;itions laid upon private
Per&s;ons. The only good effect their teaching
produceth, is this, that there are no Per&s;ons
how poor &s;oever they are, but may &s;end their
Children to the College; but on the other
hand it gives occa&s;ion to a great Evil, which
is, that this va&s;t number of Students, whereof
the greater part are of very mean Extraction,
and ill Educated, do greatly corrupt and &s;poil
one another. Yea, it is in a manner impo&s;&s;ible
that the Regents &s;hould ever be able to teach
them well, becau&s;e of their exce&s;&s;ive Num|bers,
there being &s;ometimes no le&s;s than three
hundred in one and the &s;ame Cla&s;&s;is or Form
(as we call it,) and who have but one Ma&s;ter
to teach them all. The&s;e Cla&s;&s;es are not di&s;|tingui&s;hed
<PB N="19" REF="22">
by the number of Scholars, but by
the degrees and progre&s;s of their Studies; and
there are Seven of the&s;e in every College
where the Latin Tongue is taught. They
commonly count them backward; for that
which receives the Petits at fir&s;t, is called the
&s;eventh Cla&s;&s;is, and tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t
forward in Latin, &s;uch as the Rhetoricians,
are in the fir&s;t. They continue a year in each
Cla&s;&s;is, &s;o that the Je&s;uits do not undertake to
teach Latin in le&s;s than &s;even years; whereas
I have known Ma&s;ters, who in two years time
have advanced their Scholars further than the
Je&s;uits do in all that time. Whence we may
take an e&s;timate of the extraordinary Talent
and Capacity they have to teach, and the
great Ble&s;&s;ing of God that accompanies their
In&s;titution.</P>
<P>But at this time of day that which they af|fect
mo&s;t, is not at all the Information of Youth;
they much more plea&s;e and pride them&s;elves
in Politicks and the Intrigues of State, than in
their Schools, and in giving Law to Princes,
than in &s;etting Children their Le&s;&s;on. But this
Subject would draw me too far from what I
am upon, and my de&s;ign is not at pre&s;ent to
&s;tray from the matter of Studies. After they
have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e of &s;even years to ob|tain
the Latin Tongue, the Je&s;uits have be|&s;ides
the&s;e, &s;ome other Cla&s;&s;es where they
teach Philo&s;ophy and Theology, but after a
very poor manner, and &s;uch as is not admir'd
<PB N="20" REF="23">
by any but them&s;elves. 'Tis commonly about
this time, that Scholars begin to determine
their thoughts for &s;ome particular Profe&s;&s;ion;
&s;ome go to the Univer&s;ities, others retire
them&s;elves into Convents, others dedicate
them&s;elves to the Church, and become &s;ecular
Prie&s;ts; and La&s;tly, others embrace other
Callings and Employments.</P>
<P>To repre&s;ent to my Reader in what manner
they continue their Studies in <HI>Italy,</HI> and to
what degree of Perfection they arrive, I &s;hall
endeavour to give him the mo&s;t exact de&s;crip|tion
thereof that po&s;&s;ibly I can in all the&s;e
different Stations. And in the fir&s;t place to
begin with the Univer&s;ities; every one knows,
that of all tho&s;e that are found in <HI>Italy,</HI> tho&s;e
of <HI>Bononia,</HI> of <HI>Padua</HI> and of <HI>Pavia</HI> are the mo&s;t
famous.</P>
<P>If a man hath but &s;et his Foot in one of
the&s;e Univer&s;ities, it is &s;ufficient to rai&s;e him
to the E&s;teem of a Learned man, in the minds
of the <HI>Italians,</HI> tho' it may be he knows no
more than he did the fir&s;t day of his Entrance
(&s;uch is the prevalency of a vulgar Error)
and, to &s;peak the truth, it is not very com|mon
for a man to become truly Learned
there, and that for the&s;e four rea&s;ons. In the
fir&s;t place, the Climate of <HI>Italy</HI> is &s;o &s;ultry
hot, that it is not very plea&s;ing to apply ones
&s;elf a long time to one thing: A too ob&s;tinate
and continued application, doth &s;o agitate the
Spirits, and puts them into &s;uch an Efferve&s;|cency,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
&s;ay they, that many of them would
fear the over-heating of their Brains, &s;hould they
apply them&s;elves to any &s;erious Meditations for
two or three hours together. But it mu&s;t be
own'd, as I have ob&s;erved before, that the
<HI>Italians</HI> are &s;omewhat too nice and delicate in
this point. Which is the rea&s;on why the <HI>Ita|lians,</HI>
not having the patience to examine a
que&s;tion to the bottom, chu&s;e rather to &s;up|po&s;e
it &s;uch as it is given them, than to take
the pains to penetrate it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they are not
made to Write, that is, to take Dictates. The
Readers of Philo&s;ophy or Theology content
them&s;elves to take &s;ome printed Author,
which they explain to them. Now it is &s;ure,
that tho&s;e things that are Written, make a
double Impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of Scholars,
and that the new Air that is given them, doth
more row&s;e and excite their Spirits, than the
Reading of an Old Book. Be&s;ides, Writings
or Dictates keep them more in Subjection,
than a Book, which they are &s;ure of having
always, and which the mo&s;t part let alone
very undi&s;turb'd upon their Table, yet look|ing
upon it notwith&s;tanding as their cour&s;e of
Philo&s;ophy, tho' it may be they never had
the patience to read it all over. The <HI>Itali|ans</HI>
cannot be charged with being too much
in love with Books, except it be with tho&s;e as
may a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their Amours, &s;uch as are
the Romances and Poets.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">
The Third Rea&s;on, why Scholars gain &s;o
little good in the Univer&s;ities, is this, becau&s;e
having had their fir&s;t Education under the Je|&s;uits,
they ordinarily bring along with them
thither a Spirit of Libertini&s;m and Debau|chery,
which recovering new &s;trength by this
change of place, as commonly it is, and re|motene&s;s
from their Parents, who&s;e pre&s;ence
alone is a &s;ufficient check upon Children,
they immediately give the Rains to their Pa&s;&s;i|ons,
and &s;eem to be more bu&s;ied about the
Study of Vice, than that of Virtue. I a&s;&s;ert
nothing here but what is Notorious to all
Strangers that ever frequented the&s;e Univer&s;i|ties;
and every body knows, that it is not po&s;|&s;ible
to go abroad to walk the Streets at Night
in the Cities of the&s;e Univer&s;ities, without be|ing
in great danger of feeling the In&s;olences
of the&s;e di&s;&s;olute emancipated Youths. Now
what can be imagined more incapable of &s;e|rious
Study or true Science than a di&s;ordered
and debauched mind? That which favours
and greatly heightens this Di&s;order is, that un|der
the pretext of not di&s;compo&s;ing the re|po&s;e
of the Muses, the&s;e Univer&s;ities enjoy
great Priviledges, and this above all the re&s;t,
that they cannot be troubled by any Ju&s;tice or
Tribunal, whether Eccle&s;ia&s;tical or Civil, ex|cept
only in ca&s;e of Murther, or matters
that belong to the Inqui&s;ition; which is the
right way to foment Crimes by a&s;&s;uring
them of Impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
La&s;tly, the Fourth Cau&s;e of this prevailing
Ignorance, is the pitiful method they take to
try the skill and attainments of their Students.
All men of Learning do agree, that the &s;ure&s;t
proof of the Learning and Capacity of a Stu|dent
is to expo&s;e him in publick to all the &s;hot
of tho&s;e that are his Oppo&s;its in their Opini|ons
and Sentiments, from time to time; I mean
to oblige him publickly to defend &s;ome The|&s;is
or other, to exerci&s;e him, and &s;hew him the
&s;trength or weakne&s;s of the contrary Argu|ments.
The <HI>Italians</HI> indeed as well as others,
do &s;erve them&s;elves of this method, but in
&s;uch a manner as makes it in a manner altoge|ther
u&s;ele&s;s. The Defendent having Printed
his The&s;es or Conclu&s;ions, goes and pre&s;ents
them about a Fortnight or three Weeks before
the day appointed for Di&s;putation, to all tho&s;e,
with who&s;e pre&s;ence he de&s;ires particularly to
be honoured. But there are three among&s;t
the re&s;t, whom he makes choice of for his
Opponents, and who are oblig'd in civility,
or rather by the prevailing Tyranny of a bad
Cu&s;tom, which at pre&s;ent has the force of a
Law in <HI>Italy,</HI> to acquaint him eight days af|ter,
the Points on which they intend to Ar|gue:
Yea, and to &s;end him in Writing the Ar|guments
all at length, with which they de&s;ign
to attack him. The Student therefore you
&s;ee, hath a fair time to dige&s;t them; and to
get them by heart, as well to facilitate the re|peating
of them, as to provide him&s;elf with
<PB N="24" REF="25">
An&s;wers again&s;t them. Neither is it permit|ted
to any other be&s;ides the&s;e three, to enter
the Li&s;ts again&s;t him; &s;o that the Defendent
is clearly out of harms way, without the lea&s;t
danger of having any &s;lur put upon him, and
therefore cannot fail of doing Wonders. The
fir&s;t time that I was pre&s;ent at a Di&s;putation
in <HI>Italy,</HI> I confe&s;s I was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee with
what readine&s;s the Students repeated the Ar|guments,
the pat An&s;wers they gave, and how
all the Conclu&s;ions of their Opponents turn'd
gloriou&s;ly to the Encrea&s;e of their Honour:
But after that I had di&s;covered the Intrigue
of it, they lo&s;t the great E&s;teem I had con|ceived
of their Abilities, and it was no diffi|cult
matter for me thereupon to e&s;timate the
great di&s;advantage accrued to them by this
precarious Conduct. For it follows from
hence, that the mo&s;t Ignorant Scholar of a
whole College; yea, even &s;uch an one as has
never read a Que&s;tion of Philo&s;ophy, may
maintain his The&s;es, with as much applau&s;e,
as the greate&s;t Scholar po&s;&s;ibly can: For
when he has got the Arguments of his Oppo|nents,
he needs only to procure them an|&s;wer'd
by &s;ome of his Friends, to get the An|&s;wers
by heart, in order as they &s;tand, in half
an hours time, and then boldly appear on the
Bench, by which means the greate&s;t Dance,
may pa&s;s for a great Doctor. I have often
pre&s;ented my &s;elf at <HI>Bononia</HI> to oppo&s;e &s;ome
The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s, when I &s;aw that the arguments of tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="25">
who had been Invited, had been very &s;hort,
and that there was time enough left for it; but
it was never po&s;&s;ible for me to obtain audience
with them. They are very di&s;tru&s;tful of
Strangers, e&s;pecially &s;ince that &s;ome of them
have &s;hewed them a Trick, by exerci&s;ing
them in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> are very magnificent upon all
publick Occa&s;ions; they &s;pare nothing that
may adorn and &s;et forth the place where they
Di&s;pute: All their The&s;es are commonly Print|ed
either upon Sattin or on fair &s;heets of Silk,
of all &s;orts of Colours, with curious Bra&s;s-Cuts,
at the Top of them. There are &s;ome al&s;o that
pre&s;ent tho&s;e they have Invited, with curious
No&s;egays; and generally after the Di&s;putation
is ended, the Defendent entertains the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors,
and their Opponents, with a &s;plendid
and plentiful Collation. Here now it is that
among&s;t their Cups, and good Bits, they be|&s;tow
Magnificent Encomiums upon the De|fendent,
and upon his Ma&s;ter that hath In|&s;tructed
him; they Congratulate him, with a
Gla&s;s in hand, upon his readine&s;s in repeating
the Arguments, the Propriety of his Expre&s;|&s;ions,
and the profoundne&s;s of his Learning.
But yet the&s;e Sumptuous Entertainments would
not be &s;ufficient to advance one to the Degree
of Doctor, if they were not back'd with a
pregnant Pur&s;e; and this fair Bud of Immor|tality,
I mean the Doctorate, would never
&s;pring or open, if it were not watered with a
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Golden Shower. It is very expen&s;ive to ob|tain
the Licences and the Degree of Doctor;
and 'tis very frequent on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to
&s;ee Learning, the Merits whereof ought chief|ly
to be look'd upon, Po&s;tpon'd, and Igno|rance
preferr'd, which if I mi&s;take not, may
well be e&s;teem'd a fifth Rea&s;on, why Students
do &s;o little concern them&s;elves to make any
great progre&s;s in their Studies.</P>
<P>I had always believ'd that a certain Story
very current in <HI>Italy,</HI> of an A&s;s that took his
Doctors Degree at <HI>Padua,</HI> was no more than
a Tale or Fable made at plea&s;ure: But one of
the chief Doctors of Phy&s;ick, whom I had a
particular acquaintance with, and whom I
will not name, for fear of expo&s;ing him to
the hatred of his Collegues, a&s;&s;ured me, that
it was very true. He related the matter of
Fact to me in this manner. A young Gentle|man
of the Country of the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> of a very
good Family, but &s;omewhat &s;tinted in his E|&s;tate,
had apply'd him&s;elf with extraordinary
diligence to the Study of the Canon Law,
and had very regularly perform'd all his Ex|erci&s;es
in the Univer&s;ity; and his time being
out, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf in order to be ad|mitted
Doctor: But notwith&s;tanding that his
Capacity was without exception, yet there &s;till
remained an in&s;uperable Difficulty, for want
of Mony. This troubled him &s;o much, that
he Writ to his Father about it, and they re|&s;olved
together to put a Trick upon the Rector
<PB N="27" REF="26">
of the Univer&s;ity, a man of a mo&s;t &s;ordid
Covetou&s;ne&s;s. The Students Father comes to
<HI>Padua,</HI> having borrowed a con&s;iderable Sum
of Mony of one of his Friends, and having
brought his A&s;s with him, took up his Lodg|ing
in the mo&s;t famous Inn that was in the
whole Town: This done, he goes to the Rector
about Eleven a Clock at Night, telling him,
that a young Lord a Stranger, whom he
nam'd to him, was come in Po&s;t to Town to
take his Degree, but that he found him&s;elf &s;o
extreamly tired and di&s;compos'd with his Jour|ny,
that it was Impo&s;&s;ible for him to come
and pre&s;ent him&s;elf in Per&s;on, and that be|&s;ides
he was obliged to be on Hor&s;e-back again
by Three or Four in the Morning, to get a
Benefice at <HI>Rome,</HI> which he could not be qua|lified
for without having taken his Doctors
Degree; and to give more Life and Energy to
his words, he pre&s;ents him with a Pur&s;e &s;tuff'd
with Ducats, and told him, that as &s;oon as his
Letters &s;hould be ready, his Ma&s;ter in acknow|ledgment
of &s;o great a favour would be very
ready to gratifie him further. The Rector
dazled with this charming Pre&s;ent, and in the
hopes of a &s;econd part to the &s;ame Tune, re|quired
nothing of him but the Name of the
young Lord; he got his Letters ready, and
with the &s;ame Expedition &s;ent them to the
Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity, to have the Seal
put to them. Thus all pa&s;&s;ed admirably well,
without Rub or Let in favour of good Doctor
<PB N="28" REF="27">
<HI>Martin,</HI> for that was the Name they had given
him, and which &s;till to this Day, is the com|mon
Name of all the A&s;&s;es of the Country.
This was that the Doctor related to me of this
Story; but he proceeded not to tell me what
others add to it, which is, that the next Mor|ning,
at the opening of the College-Gates,
the <HI>Gri&s;on</HI> Gentleman drove Doctor <HI>Martin</HI>
into the great Hall, being the place of publick
Di&s;putation, with his Letters Patent hung a|bout
his Neck, and a Doctors Bonnet fa&s;tned
to his Ears, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of all
the Doctors, who could not &s;ufficiently admire
the Port and Maje&s;ty of their New-Collegue.
I don't love to relate Matters that turn &s;o much
to the Confu&s;ion of the&s;e great Bodies of the
Univer&s;ities, for whom I have always had re|&s;pect
and Veneration; and I had rather in|cline
my Reader to believe, that all this is no
more than the pure Invention of &s;ome witty
Droll, whereby he had a mind to expre&s;s to
the World, that the&s;e Rectors are commonly
more &s;en&s;ible of the Mony, than of the Me|rits
of tho&s;e they promote. However, thus
much I think my &s;elf oblig'd to declare to the
Honour of the&s;e Illu&s;trious Bodies, that they
have at all times made them&s;elves Renowned,
by &s;ome great Men that have &s;ignaliz'd them|&s;elves
among&s;t them, by their extraordinary
Parts and Learning: And when I &s;ay that Ig|norance
Reigns among&s;t them, I &s;peak only
of the generality or greater part of them.
<PB N="29" REF="27">
For I know that there are always found a|mong&s;t
them Spirits naturally elevated above
the common Pitch, and who by the Noble
Efforts they make to rai&s;e them&s;elves out of
the Du&s;t, do ju&s;tly de&s;erve to be di&s;tingui&s;ht.
Neither am I Ignorant that many of them
have given &s;ufficient Proof of their Learning
by the gallant Works they have left us; and
many Per&s;ons who have Travelled in <HI>Italy,</HI>
have received much Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction
in their Conver&s;ation. Some of the&s;e Tra|vellers
have proceeded &s;o far in honouring of
them, as to give them particular Elogies in
the Relations they have given us of their own
Travels: Yet for my part, I am Inclin'd &s;ome|times
to under&s;tand the&s;e kind of Encomiums
with re&s;triction, and that for two Rea&s;ons.
The fir&s;t is this, that Travellers are ve|ry
often prepo&s;&s;e&s;t with the Learning of &s;ome
Per&s;ons, before they are well acquainted with
it, and are &s;ometimes &s;trongly carried to Pro|claim
them va&s;t Scholars, becau&s;e they have
done them &s;ome Service, or have expre&s;t a
great deal of Civility to them on their Voyage.
I know at <HI>Bononia</HI> a Per&s;on of mean Lear|ning
and Parts, who compell'd a Stranger to
go and &s;pend Eight days at his Country-Hou&s;e,
where he Treated him mo&s;t Sumptu|ou&s;ly
every day, and &s;ent for all the Rarities
that were to be got about <HI>Bononia,</HI> only be|cau&s;e
he had heard this Stranger &s;ay, that he
intended to Publi&s;h his Voyage of <HI>Italy.</HI> His
<PB N="30" REF="28">
Son having demanded of him, why, contra|ry
to the Genius of the Country, he would
put him&s;elf to &s;o great Charges in Treating of
a Per&s;on, who was a perfect Stranger to him?
The Father An&s;wered, that what he did was
not without Rea&s;on, fora&s;much as that hone&s;t
Man had declared that he intended to Rank
his Name among&s;t the Learned Men of <HI>Italy,</HI>
in the Book of his Travels he intended to Pub|li&s;h.
It is not of to day only that the <HI>Italians</HI>
are accu&s;ed for being Liberal in nothing but
Ceremonies and Compliments, and extreamly
cautelous and re&s;erved about any thing that
may engage them in any particular Expences:
But yet if a man would take the pains to
comport with them in their humour, and
more e&s;pecially flatter them in the vain Am|bition
they have, tho' very Ignorant, to pa&s;s
for Learned Men, a Man might draw from
them what he plea&s;ed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Rea&s;on, why I would not always
take the Prai&s;es that Travellers be&s;tow, accor|ding
to the rigour of the Letter, is this, be|cau&s;e
there be many <HI>Italians</HI> who practi&s;e that,
which may be called the Art of being e&s;teem'd
Learned at a cheap rate. This Art con&s;i&s;ts
in chu&s;ing out &s;ome particular and &s;elect
Points, and be&s;towing all their Application
and Study upon them for &s;ome time together,
until that they are become perfectly Ma&s;ters
of them, and till they find them&s;elves in a
Condition to re&s;olve all the doubts that can
<PB N="31" REF="28">
be objected again&s;t them. If it be a matter
that may be confirm'd by Authorities, care is
taken to get the mo&s;t con&s;iderable by heart;
and if it depend more upon Experience, they
endeavour to exerci&s;e them&s;elves therein, un|til
the managing of it be made ea&s;y to them,
and they have got the perfect Command of it.
And after all (&s;ay the <HI>Italians,)</HI> that Man is a
great Blockhead, who cannot in&s;en&s;ibly make
the Conver&s;ation he is engag'd in, to fall upon
the point he is mo&s;t ver&s;ed in; and the more
dexterou&s;ly he can do this, the more he makes
him&s;elf to be admir'd. But yet the&s;e &s;ort of
Men, let them carry it as cunningly as they
can, they are &s;till di&s;covered &s;ooner or later,
by tho&s;e that frequent their Company for any
time; but Travellers indeed, who only pa&s;s by
and are gon, may ea&s;ily be impos'd upon by
this method, and be apt to believe them equal|ly
able in all other Parts. I know many Lear|ned
Men of this Stamp: There was one at
<HI>Venice</HI> whom we call'd <HI>Phy&s;ical Predetermination;</HI>
another, <HI>Copernicus his Sy&s;teme;</HI> another, <HI>the
World in the Moon,</HI> and many others, upon
whom we be&s;towed the name of the things
they had got by Rote, and wherewith they
continually alarm'd Men's Ears. As &s;oon as
they were entred into Di&s;cour&s;e with any
one, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to draw near to un|der&s;tand
what they &s;aid, for that might be
&s;een from far by their Actions and Ge&s;ture of
their Arms and Hands, as the <HI>Italians</HI> u&s;e to
<PB N="32" REF="29">
do, who are plea&s;ed to &s;ignalize them&s;elves
this way. This is that I call the Art of gain|ing
the repute of Learning at an ea&s;y rate.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay that all make u&s;e of this me|thod,
there are &s;ome to be found that are Lear|ned
indeed and in good earne&s;t; and it cannot
be denied, but we meet with Men there, that
are very able in all kind of Profe&s;&s;ions; and
what I have before alledged is only to &s;hew,
that Travellers may &s;ometimes be deceived in
them. I &s;hall add one Remark more, I have
made concerning the&s;e Learned Men, which
is, that we do indeed find &s;ome of them that
excel in the Civil and Canon Law; others in
Phy&s;ick, in Chymi&s;try, in Hi&s;tory; &s;ome few
in the Mathematicks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but withall, that it is
a kind of Prodigy to meet with one that un|der&s;tands
<HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> or that is well
vers'd in Holy Scripture, or that is a good
Divine, in the Popi&s;h way; and yet all the&s;e
are &s;uch accompli&s;hments, as one would think
&s;hould be very becoming, if not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
in a Country that is &s;o full of Prie&s;ts
as <HI>Italy</HI> is. The rea&s;on whereof, as far as I
could ever penetrate, is, that all the&s;e kind of
Studies, are neither favoured by the great ones,
nor encouraged by rewards, nor &s;upported
by any Temporal Intere&s;t. The Languages
of the Dead (if we except in &s;ome kind the
Latin,) are of &s;mall Credit in the Courts of
<HI>Italian</HI> Princes, becau&s;e of the difficulty there
is in becoming Ma&s;ter of them, and for the
<PB N="33" REF="29">
&s;mall u&s;e, according to their Conceit, they are
of in the World, after one with great prai&s;e
has attain'd &s;ome competent skill in them. As
for Divinity, that &s;eems yet more u&s;ele&s;s to
them, than any of the re&s;t; becau&s;e the Je|&s;uits,
who are the Popes Emi&s;&s;aries, and the
Confe&s;&s;ors of all the Princes and great Men,
make them believe that it is a pitiful kind of
Science, and only fit for Monks and other Re|ligious
to amu&s;e them&s;elves about it, and that
the be&s;t Divinity for a &s;ecular Per&s;on is to
under&s;tand none of it, but only to believe con|fu&s;edly
and in general as the Church believes,
as being the true and &s;ure way to avoid all
tho&s;e Temptations which may carry Mens
minds towards Novelties and Here&s;ies. So
that if any Man &s;hould undertake, at pre&s;ent,
to talk of Divinity in the pre&s;ence of the
Princes or Lords of <HI>Italy,</HI> he would make his
Company not only unea&s;y, but ridiculous.
The Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with other Sciences;
tho&s;e that po&s;&s;e&s;s them, may by their means
advance them&s;elves in the World. A Per&s;on
is always in good e&s;teem that hath attained to
con&s;iderable skill in the Civil Law, in the Ma|thematicks,
in Phy&s;ick, or even in the Canon
Law, e&s;pecially in Beneficiary ca&s;es. All
the&s;e Sciences are of as good &s;tead to a Man
as a plentiful Patrimony, and are the making
of tho&s;e who are well ver&s;ed in them: But
poor Divinity is hated, and abandoned by al|mo&s;t
all the World. I was acquainted at <HI>Bo|nonia</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="30">
with a young Gentleman, who had ap|pli'd
him&s;elf to this Forlorne Study, for &s;ome
years; and having one day asked him, whe|ther
he continued in the vigorous pro&s;ecution
of his Studies, he told me, that he was ju&s;t a|bout
to quit it for good and all; to learn to
play on the Violin, becau&s;e he believed that
Art would be much more profitable to him.
See here a true account of the Langui&s;hing
Condition of Theology in tho&s;e Univer&s;ities,
and which is the rea&s;on that &s;carcely any pro|fe&s;&s;ors
can be found in them, that are capable
of Teaching it. This is no Exaggeration at
all, but is a thing vi&s;ible and notorious; for it
is this extream &s;carcity of Divines, that hath
obliged them to Incorporate &s;ome Monks into
their Body, under the Name of Doctors or
Profe&s;&s;ors of Divinity, to the end they might
teach that Faculty among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much as I am in&s;en&s;ibly got among&s;t
the Monks, and that I have &s;ufficiently, as I
&s;uppo&s;e, de&s;cribed the manner of Studying in
their Univer&s;ities; I per&s;wade my &s;elf you will
not be di&s;plea&s;ed to under&s;tand the method
the&s;e ob&s;erve in the Colleges of their Con|vents
or Religious Hou&s;es in <HI>Italy.</HI> We will
begin with the Je&s;uits; we have already taken
a View of their way of Teaching Latin, and
it remains now for us to take notice in what
manner they regulate their own Studies, with
regard to their young Je&s;uits; for if they be
able to perform any thing in this kind, which
<PB N="35" REF="30">
is the Foundation of their In&s;titution, we
may expect to &s;ee the faire&s;t Fruits of it in the
young Plants of their Society. Thus much
we may &s;afely aver of them, that they have
in &s;ome &s;ort the very choice of Spirits, it be|ing
ea&s;y for them, among&s;t that va&s;t Number
of Scholars that are under their In&s;pection,
to pick out tho&s;e they think mo&s;t fit for their
Turn, having had the opportunity of ob&s;erv|ing
them of a long time. See here the cour&s;e
they take: They indu&s;triou&s;ly apply them|&s;elves
to examine the Temperament of their
Scholars, e&s;pecially when they are in their
la&s;t or highe&s;t Latin Cla&s;&s;is, where they are
taught Rhetorick. If they have ob&s;erv'd
any of them that are of a well temper'd, mo|de&s;t
and compos'd Humor, they &s;ay &s;uch a
one will be good to make a <HI>Benedictin,</HI> for
they call the Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Ben|net,</HI>
not without an Air of &s;lighting and con|tempt,
good Men: If they perceive another
that is of a Silent, Soure, Sullen and Melan|choly
Temper, this Youth, &s;ay they, will
make a good <HI>Chartreux, Camaldule,</HI> or un|&s;hod
<HI>Carmelite:</HI> If they find another of a
&s;weet and plea&s;ant humour, and of a tender
and effeminate Complexion, &s;uch a one they
look upon as proper to a&s;&s;ociate with the Ca|non
Regulars, or <HI>Olivetans,</HI> or to be a Con|fe&s;&s;or
to Nuns: If any of them be inclin'd to
Boufonry, and to play tricks of Legerde|main;
See there a Youth, &s;ay they, that will
<PB N="36" REF="31">
fit the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> and <HI>Minimes:</HI> Others that
are of da&s;tardly, mean and cowardly Spirits,
they turn over to the <HI>Capucins,</HI> for they
are very well acquainted what Spirit Reigns in
each Order.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, If they chance to meet with any
poor, ignorant, and &s;imple Youth, and who&s;e
mind has no Elevation at all, they hope that
&s;uch a one may by their means come to be a
good Country Curate. They make no diffi|culty
in the Cla&s;s of Rhetorick, to take every
one of their Scholars apart, and declare to
them, the Calling to which God &s;eems to
have called them. But as for them&s;elves, if
they find one that is of a keen and &s;ubtil Spi|rit,
brisk and active, full of Fire, daring and
undertaking, the&s;e are the Youths for&s;ooth,
that are for their Society; the&s;e are the Per|&s;ons
fit for their Tooth, and &s;uch they endea|vour
to gain to their Number.</P>
<P>After &s;ome years pa&s;t in their Novitiat and
Travels, they &s;et them to Teach Latin, and
make them Regents over the &s;even Cla&s;&s;es, in
Order, one after another, which is their Em|ployment
for &s;even years; and during all this
time, they do not &s;uffer them to mind any
other thing, but what concerns their Cla&s;&s;es;
no nor &s;o much as to read any Book, but tho&s;e
that are de&s;ign'd for that u&s;e. When they
enter into the Society, they commonly are
about 21 or 22 years of Age, &s;o that before
they have fini&s;hed their Regency, over all the
<PB N="37" REF="31">
&s;even Latin Cla&s;&s;es, they are above Thirty
years of Age. Then it is they are put upon
the Studying of Philo&s;ophy, and afterwards
of Theology; in the fir&s;t of which they &s;pend
two years, and in the latter three.</P>
<P>'Tis about this time, that the Fathers make
another Scrutiny or Tryal of the Spirits of
their younger Je&s;uits. Tho&s;e who have kept
all their Fire, and make them&s;elves remark|able
for their Boldne&s;s and Re&s;olution, are
de&s;ign'd to be Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and the re&s;t are
left to their liberty, to apply them&s;elves to
&s;ome particular Study, for which they have
mo&s;t Inclination; or el&s;e they make Preachers
of them, whil&s;t the Old Je&s;uits are the Do|ctors
of Fraternites, or hear Confe&s;&s;ions. But
all of them generally are Educated in a Spirit
of refined Policy, which doth not &s;hake hands
with them till Death. And tho&s;e in whom
this Spirit is mo&s;t rife and pregnant, are ad|vanced
to the Charges and Employs of the
Society, or el&s;e means are found out to plea&s;e
them in the Courts of Princes; and if any
one be found that is not Baptized into this
Spirit, tho' otherwi&s;e he be endowed with the
mo&s;t promi&s;ing Talents that may be, he is
&s;ure to be expell'd the Society of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Now the Conclu&s;ion we may draw from
what I have here repre&s;ented, concerning the
Conduct of the Je&s;uits, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is in
a manner impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever attain to
any great degree of Learning; for the very
<PB N="38" REF="32">
prime of their Youth, and the Age that is
mo&s;t proper to apply them&s;elves to Sciences,
is wholly employed in Learning and Teach|ing
Latin; &s;o that we have rea&s;on to believe
that to be the only thing they are good at;
and yet the truth is, that even herein they
make them&s;elves ridiculous. The Proverb tells
us, that <HI>the Corruption of the best things, is the
wor&s;t: Corruptio optimi, pe&s;&s;ima;</HI> and it may be
&s;aid al&s;o, that the Je&s;uits, who probably read
none but the be&s;t Authors of the Latin Tongue,
do make a kind of mixture of them in their
Spirits, to which they &s;uperadd an intolerable
kind of Affectation, that utterly &s;poils all the
good that could be in it. All their Latin is
commonly thick, larded with <HI>Enimveros,
Quidems</HI> and <HI>Ergo</HI>'s: I can no better parallel
this their Folly, than by comparing it with
the Vanity of &s;ome Women, who from an
exce&s;s of de&s;ire they have to appear Beautiful,
dawb their Faces &s;o thick with Paint and
Patches, that quite contrary to their de&s;ign,
they make them&s;elves ugly and abominable.
All the honour that is rendred to their Latin,
is this, that in all the Societies where they
&s;peak good Latin, as with the Gentlemen of
<HI>Port Royal,</HI> and in all the Schools of Phy&s;icians,
it is termed <HI>pitiful Je&s;uits Latin.</HI></P>
<P>As for what concerns their Philo&s;ophy and
Divinity, which they are made to Study, af|ter
that they have Taught Latin, that we
may di&s;cover the nature thereof, we are fir&s;t to
<PB N="39" REF="32">
know, that the Society of Je&s;uits, having been
in&s;tituted at <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Ignatius Loyola,</HI> had at
fir&s;t no other Schools, be&s;ides the publick
Schools, nor any other Opinions, but &s;uch as
are commonly Taught there.</P>
<P>In their general A&s;&s;embly held in the year
1550, they made &s;ome Con&s;titutions, by
which their Founder oblig'd them to follow
the Doctrin of St. <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> as to their
Divinity, and con&s;equently in all Que&s;tions of
Philo&s;ophy, that nece&s;&s;arily depend upon it.
There are to this day &s;ome of their The&s;es
to be &s;een, publickly defended by them in
their College at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the years 1560,
and 1562; a &s;hort time after the Death of
their Founder, and at the &s;itting of the Coun|cil
of <HI>Trent,</HI> where they defend the Opinions
of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> concerning Grace, directly op|po&s;it
to tho&s;e they maintain at pre&s;ent. In
the mean time, <HI>James Lainez</HI> being cho&s;en
General in 1558, two years after the Death
of <HI>Ignatius Loyola,</HI> he cau&s;ed a Statute to pa&s;s,
at the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly where he had been
Elected, by the which it was re&s;olved, that
they &s;hould Teach al&s;o the Ma&s;ter of Sen|tences;
but in ca&s;e afterwards, it &s;hould be
judged, that &s;ome other Author, would be
more profitable to the Students, as if they
&s;hould think fit to compo&s;e a new Sum of
Theology, or any other <HI>Work that might bet|ter
comport with the Times, (Temporibus accommo|datior,)</HI>
that then the &s;ame might be made
<PB N="40" REF="33">
u&s;e of, after a mature Deliberation. <HI>Lainez</HI>
having thus left the Je&s;uits at liberty, to find
out a method of Teaching Philo&s;ophy, more
accommodate to the latter Times, than that
which had been followed ever &s;ince the School|men
were known in the World, (for it was
about this time, that they re&s;olved to &s;et up
for great Politicians, and to be the Depravers
of Science and Morality, the better to plea&s;e
the corrupt age in which their Lot was fallen;)
and the very &s;ame year &s;everal In&s;tances were
given of this Corruption.</P>
<P>In the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Salamanca, Prudentius</HI>
of <HI>Monte Major</HI> a Je&s;uit, publickly maintained
a The&s;is, wherein he rejected all the ab&s;olute
Decrees of God, with re&s;pect to acts of hu|man
Liberty, and particularly all Prede&s;tina|tion
gratuitous and independent on any fore|&s;ight
of good actions, with &s;ome other like
Doctrins. The Divinity Faculty of that
Univer&s;ity condemned them, but they plea&s;ed
the Society well enough, who gave permi&s;&s;ion
to their Divines to teach them, according as
occa&s;ion and Time &s;hould &s;eem favourable
for it.</P>
<P>Now in order to their finding out a way
intirely to &s;hake off the Yoak of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s
Doctrin, <HI>Claudius Aqua Viva,</HI> General of the
Je&s;uits, in the year 1584, called to <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ix
of the mo&s;t able Divines of the Society, with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">der to con&s;ult beforehand, the mo&s;t Lear|ned
of each Province, to make a choice of
<PB N="41" REF="33">
tho&s;e &s;elect Opinions, which were to be
taught in their Society. The&s;e Divines be|ing
come to <HI>Rome,</HI> they there compos'd a
Book with this Title; <HI>Ratio atque In&s;titutio Stu|diorum
Societatis Je&s;u. The way and In&s;titution
of the Studies of the Society of Je&s;us,</HI> which
was Printed in 1586. Here it was that they
ab&s;olutely ca&s;t off S. <HI>Austin</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI>
upon the Points of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;ical
Predetermination,</HI> which they were allow'd the
Liberty to maintain till then. They e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
their <HI>mediate knowledge,</HI> the Fore&s;ight of
future Contingents, and they explain'd the
Efficacy of Grace, after the manner of the
<HI>Pelagians,</HI> and <HI>Semipelagians,</HI> as if the &s;ame
were intirely dependent on the Free-will of
Man, which they do not &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;o
corrupt, as the mo&s;t Venerable Doctors of
Antiquity, and particularly S. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> took it
to be.</P>
<P>It will not be be&s;ides our purpo&s;e, to repre|&s;ent
to you here a brief Reflexion upon a
&s;hort Sentence I met with in the &s;ame <HI>Directory
of the Studies of the Society,</HI> where it is &s;aid,
<HI>that it is for the honour of the Society of Je&s;us
that a new Theology be introduc'd, with Liberty
of Spirit:</HI> That is to &s;ay, without being too
&s;trictly tied up to the Opinions of the ancient
Fathers, or to the Deci&s;ions of the Modern
Doctors. Be&s;ides it implies, that they had a
terrible Itch of Pride to joyn to their Novel
In&s;titution, a novelty of Doctrin and Morals,
<PB N="42" REF="34">
that might di&s;tingui&s;h them from all others.
For it &s;eem'd &s;omewhat hard and grating up|on
them, that being Je&s;uits, they were fain
to be <HI>Thomi&s;ts</HI> in their Opinions.</P>
<P><HI>Molina</HI> a Spani&s;h Je&s;uit, was one of the
mo&s;t bold and venturous in Publi&s;hing the
new Doctrin of the Society, and publickly
boa&s;ted, that the greater part of it, was of
his own Invention. He Publi&s;hed in the year
1588, his Work intituled <HI>The Concord of Grace
and Free-will:</HI> The Opinions he there vented,
were the &s;ame with tho&s;e of other Je&s;uits, but
proved by Metaphy&s;ical Rea&s;ons, after the
manner of the Schools. He made no bones
to &s;ay, that S. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> had been involved in a
kind of Darkne&s;s, as to what concerns the
Doctrin of Grace; and that he had believ'd
that <HI>Gratuitous Prede&s;tination</HI> was nece&s;&s;arily
joyn'd with it. The de&s;ign of the Je&s;uits here|in
was this, that conformably to the Re&s;olu|tion
they had taken, to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves
by abandoning S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and finding as yet
no means, they had a mind cunningly and
under other Terms, to re&s;tore <HI>Pelagiani&s;m,</HI>
which &s;eem'd to them more plau&s;ible to be
maintain'd, than the efficacious Grace of
S. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> which too openly favoured the ne|ce&s;&s;itating
Grace of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> (as
they are pleas'd to call it,) which had been
condemned at the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> or rather,
which &s;eem'd to be one and the &s;ame with it.
To the end therefore, they might more dex|terou&s;ly
<PB N="43" REF="34">
obtain this their end, and the more
&s;weetly engage the minds of Men to receive
it; they were not wanting from time to time,
to make their Di&s;ciples publickly to maintain
the Doctrin of S. <HI>Austin</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> that
by this means they might appear to be di&s;in|tere&s;ted
Men, and that &s;earched after nothing
but the Truth. But all this their addre&s;s and
cunning, did not hinder the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> being
incen&s;ed by <HI>Molina</HI>'s Book, openly to oppo&s;e
them&s;elves again&s;t their Innovations, and &s;uc|ceeded
&s;o well in their Pur&s;uit, that <HI>Clement</HI>
VIII. e&s;tabli&s;hed a Congregation at <HI>Rome,</HI> to
hear the Rea&s;ons of both Parties. They be|gan
with the Examination of <HI>Molina</HI>'s Book,
and they reduc'd his Doctrin to four Princi|ples,
which they explained in divers Propo&s;i|tions.
And fora&s;much as they make a part of
the Theology of the Je&s;uits, I do not think
it a wandring from my Subject, to give you
here a &s;hort account of them.</P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t Principle of</HI> Molina <HI>is,</HI> That the ge|neral
Concour&s;e of God, doth not con&s;i&s;t in acting
upon &s;econd Cau&s;es, as if they stood in need of
being moved by God, in order to produce their ef|fect;
but that God acts immediately in the Action,
together with the Cau&s;e; and that if God &s;hould
pu&s;h on the Will to act, he would thereby ruin the
Liberty thereof. <HI>From which Principle</HI> Molina
<HI>drew the&s;e Con&s;equences.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="35">
1. That Man by the &s;trength of Nature, can
believe Supernatural My&s;teries.</P>
<P>2. That having performed what lies in him,
according to his natural Strength and Ability,
God comes in and bestows his Grace; and that
God fore&s;eeing who tho&s;e are, that will make u&s;e
of the&s;e Abilities, when the Go&s;pel &s;hall be Preach|ed
unto them, he is ready to be&s;tow upon them
the Grace that is nece&s;&s;ary for their total Conver|&s;ion.</P>
<P>3. That a man by his natural Strength, can
form a re&s;olution of never offending God, for time
to come.</P>
<P>4. That natural Light may be &s;ufficient to keep
the Law of Nature, what&s;oever trouble or diffi|culty
there may be in the doing of it.</P>
<P><HI>The Second Principle of</HI> Molina <HI>is,</HI> that God
doth not refu&s;e to any grown Per&s;on, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
that is nece&s;&s;ary for him to per&s;evere in that which
it good; &s;o that it is the fault of him who doth
not per&s;evere in Godline&s;s, and not the want of
Grace, that makes him to fall away.</P>
<P><HI>The Third Principle is,</HI> that we are to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
in God, three &s;orts of Knowledg, the one
purely Natural, the other altogether free, and the
third Mediate, or partaking of both; according
to which latter, God by the intimate knowledg he
hath of the Free-will of every man, knows what
he would do, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch or &s;uch a thing, tho'
it be in his power to do the contrary. <HI>Under this
Principle are comprehended the&s;e Propo&s;i|tions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="35">
1. That there is but one exciting Grace, and
none that is Efficacious in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>2. That it is not Grace that determines the Free-will,
but that the Free-will determines it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>The Fourth Principle is,</HI> That God Prede&s;ti|nates
tho&s;e, who he fore&s;ees by his mediate know|ledg,
will make good u&s;e of the &s;trength of Na|ture
and of Grace.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ulters of the Congregation, <HI>de
Auxiliis,</HI> (for &s;o they call'd them, becau&s;e they
therein treated concerning the a&s;&s;i&s;tances
which God affords Men, in order to apply
them&s;elves to that which is good;) had couch|ed
the Sentiments of <HI>Molina</HI> in Twenty Pro|po&s;itions,
whereof the mo&s;t are the very &s;ame,
or to the &s;ame Sen&s;e of tho&s;e we have here
&s;et down. They cen&s;ured every one of them,
as may be &s;een in the abridgment of the Acts,
which is &s;till in being, and declared that <HI>Mo|lina</HI>
and his Adherents, which are the Je&s;uits,
had e&s;pou&s;ed the Opinions of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI>
and the <HI>Semipelagians,</HI> as well in the Princi|ples
of their Doctrin, as in their Proofs and
Objections. They tell us that hereupon, the
Je&s;uits joyned Threats with their Prayers, to
hinder the Publication of this Cen&s;ure, and
that out of very Rage they publickly maintain'd
in <HI>Rome,</HI> that it was no part of the Faith, that
<HI>Clement</HI> VIII. was Pope, and that he was not
Infallible. Their Adver&s;aries have u&s;ed the
&s;ame liberty towards the Popes, when ever
they proved contrary to them, and there is
<PB N="46" REF="36">
great probability, that they do not think them|&s;elves
oblig'd to maintain the Infallibility of
the Pope, except then only when it is of u&s;e
to them to overthrow their Adver&s;aries. How|ever
the Pope was re&s;olved to decide this dif|ference
by a Bull, in ca&s;e the Je&s;uits &s;hould re|fu&s;e
to &s;ubmit them&s;elves: But his Death
which hapned the Eighth of <HI>March 1605,</HI> de|livered
them from the fear they were in of
being forced to retract their Doctrin, or of
being Condemned. <HI>Paul</HI> V. who &s;ucceeded
to <HI>Leo</HI> XI. took the &s;ame matter in hand,
with de&s;ign to decide it.</P>
<P>At this time it was, that the Je&s;uits, being
in a greater apprehen&s;ion than ever, of &s;eeing
their Doctrin Condemned for Heretical, and
all their fine Projects for e&s;tabli&s;hing of their
Novel Opinions, overthrown; their General
<HI>Aqua Viva</HI> thought fit to make a Show of
changing them in &s;ome re&s;pect. He made a
Decree, dated the Fourteenth of <HI>December,</HI>
whereby he ordered tho&s;e of the Society, for
time to come, to teach this Doctrin with
&s;ome Modification, by approaching in &s;ome
Degree to the Grace of the <HI>Thomi&s;ts:</HI> But this
having been ca&s;t in the Teeth of the Je&s;uits,
as a reproach tending to their &s;hame and con|fu&s;ion,
<HI>Mutio Vitellexti,</HI> the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Aqua
Viva</HI> in the General&s;hip, declared, that it
had not been the intention of his Predece&s;&s;or,
to retract their Dogmas, and accordingly he re|&s;tored
the Opinions of the Society to their
<PB N="47" REF="36">
former State. Thus we &s;ee that the Doctrin
of the Je&s;uits changed three times in le&s;s than
Thirty years: For they departed from the
Sentiments of S. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to tho&s;e
of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> and from thence they re|turned
again anew to tho&s;e of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI>
from whence &s;oon after they fell again to
their di&s;charged Vomit, I mean to <HI>Molini&s;m</HI>
or <HI>Pelagiani&s;m.</HI> They gave a remarkable in|&s;tance
in the&s;e their &s;hiftings, that they did
indeed accommodate their Doctrin to the
times, <HI>Temporibus accommodatior,</HI> according to
their own expre&s;&s;ion. And that at la&s;t the
great Itch they had of &s;ignalizing their Socie|ty
by novel and particular Opinions, pre|vail'd
again&s;t all manner of Rea&s;ons what&s;oe|ver.
They knew &s;o well to manage the Spi|rit
of <HI>Paul</HI> V. which they had &s;weetned to|wards
them, by dedicating to him a &s;econd
Edition of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ianius,</HI> that notwith&s;tanding
the Doctrin of <HI>Molina,</HI> the Je&s;uit, had been
pronounced Heretical, by the Congregation
<HI>de Auxilus,</HI> as well as by him&s;elf and his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors,
he forbore Publi&s;hing the Bull,
which he had prepared to thunder-&s;trike it
with, and contented him&s;elf with the Pub|li&s;hing
of a Decree, by which he impo&s;ed &s;i|lence
on both Parties, until it &s;hould plea&s;e
him to make the Deci&s;ion. The Je&s;uits in
the mean time, per&s;i&s;ted in their new Dogmas,
and in proce&s;s of Time, had the good &s;ucce&s;s
to keep them &s;tanding, in &s;pite of their Ad|ver&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="37">
I cannot deny, but that the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> hath a great Intere&s;t on one hand, to
Found new Religious Orders, as being a &s;ort
of People, that promi&s;e total Subjection, and
inviolabe Faithfulne&s;s to her; but on the other
hand, Time may make it appear, that they
will prove a great means of rending and di&s;|membring
her, by their re&s;tle&s;s Ambition of
di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by their Doctrins.</P>
<P>This is that which wanted little of being
accompli&s;ht in our days, wherein we have
&s;een a va&s;t number of <HI>Augu&s;tinians</HI> and <HI>Tho|mi&s;ts,</HI>
under the name of <HI>Jan&s;enists,</HI> in a fair
way of rending them&s;elves from the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> when by the in&s;tigation of the Je|&s;uits,
they were going about to condemn the
Dogmas of their Ma&s;ters. Yet was it not the
Solidity and prevalency of the Je&s;uitical Ar|guments,
that made them triumph at la&s;t;
but indeed the only thing that procured them
this advantage, was the Temporal Power,
which at pre&s;ent they have acquired in all
Places, that follow the Communion of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that whil&s;t the poor <HI>Jan&s;e|ni&s;ts,</HI>
good Souls, were wholly employed in po|ring
upon S. <HI>Austin,</HI> to &s;earch out tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages
they &s;tood in need of, to maintain their
<HI>Efficacious Grace,</HI> the&s;e made it their chief bu|&s;ine&s;s
to manage the Spirit of the Pope, and
of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> to &s;ecure them&s;elves a
Party in the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> and to engage the Bi|&s;hops
in <HI>France</HI> on their &s;ide, by making u&s;e of
the Royal Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="37">
To make an end of giving you a ju&s;t and
full Idea of all their Divinity, it &s;hall &s;uffice
to acquaint you, that the Faculty of <HI>Lovain,</HI>
in the Year 1677, did by their Deputies,
pre&s;ent to the Pope, &s;everal Propo&s;itions re|lating
to Morals, drawn out of the Books of
Je&s;uits, Sixty five whereof were Condemned by
a Decree of the Second of <HI>March 1678.</HI> This
only con&s;ideration of the multiplicity of Er|rors
that are found in their Books, ought to
be a &s;ufficient Ground to the Papi&s;ts, for &s;u&s;|pecting
all the Divinity of the&s;e Reverend
Fathers. It is not without cau&s;e, that the
Modern Papi&s;ts are accu&s;ed of being the grea|te&s;t
Lyars in the World, of having no human
Faith, of Violating all manner of Oaths,
of breaking their Words, and of making le&s;s
difficulty of for&s;wearing them&s;elves, than the
very Turks and Infidels. They are behold|ing
for the Progre&s;s they have made in the&s;e
goodly Virtues, to the Novel Doctrin of the
Je&s;uits, who have introduced their mental re|&s;trictions,
to &s;ave them from the odious charge
of a Lye.</P>
<P>According to the&s;e Ca&s;ui&s;ts, if a Chri&s;tian
be asked Whether he believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t;
he may an&s;wer no; &s;uppo&s;ing that he means
in his heart, that he doth not believe in him
as the Turks do, who believe in him, only as
a Prophet. If he be asked Whether he be a
Prote&s;tant; he may &s;ay upon occa&s;ion, that he
is one, if his inward meaning be, that he pro|te&s;ts
<PB N="50" REF="38">
again&s;t the Errors of the Prote&s;tants. I
heard a <HI>Penegyrick</HI> pronounced at <HI>Milan,</HI> by a
Je&s;uit, in honour of St. <HI>Charles Borromeo,</HI> Car|dinal
and Archbi&s;hop of that City: One of
the Principal Points in&s;i&s;ted on, was the great
Charity this Saint expre&s;t towards two Fa|mous
Robbers on the High-way, who were
Pur&s;ued by &s;ome Officers of Ju&s;tice; they
asked the Saint, Whether he had &s;een the&s;e
two Criminals pa&s;&s;ing that way? No, quoth he,
they did not pa&s;s this way: You mu&s;t know,
he had at that time his Finger in his Sleeve,
through which, his meaning was, that the
Robbers had not pa&s;&s;ed; and the Officers giv|ing
credit to his words, cea&s;ed from pur&s;uing
them, by which means they had the opportu|nity
to make their e&s;cape. O action truly ho|ly
and worthy of all prai&s;e! Precious Fruit of
the mental re&s;ervation of the Je&s;uits!</P>
<P>The World mu&s;t al&s;o be informed, that af|ter
three years Study &s;pent upon this Excel|lent
Divinity, the Je&s;uits make choice of
their Preachers, and Mi&s;&s;ionaries, without
ever having had the time, nay it may be, &s;o
much as a thought, to read the Scriptures or
the Fathers; and accordingly we may gue&s;s,
what the&s;e men are capable to perform. The
former, <HI>viz.</HI> their Preachers abound in words,
without much Sen&s;e or Solidity, <HI>Multa verba,
nullus fere &s;en&s;us:</HI> And as for the latter, that is,
their Mi&s;&s;ionaries, we may take the height of
their Standard, by tho&s;e of them we meet with
<PB N="51" REF="38">
in <HI>England;</HI> who&s;e whole Stock commonly a|mounts
to no more than two or three poor
Arguments, which after all conclude nothing.</P>
<P>They demand in the fir&s;t place, Where the
Prote&s;tant Church was before <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Cal|vin?</HI>
and then &s;et them&s;elves to exaggerate the
Vices and Defects of tho&s;e two Per&s;ons. From
thence they pa&s;s over to give a Repre&s;entation
of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the mo&s;t malicious Colours
they can; and conclude from all this, that it
is very unlikely, that God &s;hould ever have
made u&s;e of &s;uch Per&s;ons, to make a Reforma|tion.
Others of them ask a Prote&s;tant, Whe|ther
it be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to be
&s;aved in the Romi&s;h Religion? And becau&s;e he
is more Charitable than they are, and unwil|ling
to condemn any one, they would infer
from thence, that theirs is the &s;ure&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>I am acquainted here in <HI>London</HI> with a Lady,
who turned Papi&s;t in King <HI>James</HI> his time;
the Argument that over&s;wayed her was this:
The Je&s;uits told her, that that mu&s;t be the true
Church, which can give full a&s;&s;urance of Sal|vation
to all her Members; that the Prote&s;tant
Church gives no a&s;&s;urance at all; but that the
Romi&s;h Church does: From whence it follow|ed,
that &s;he mu&s;t be the true Church. Where|upon,
this Gentlewoman went, as &s;he &s;aid,
and con&s;ulted the mo&s;t able Doctors of <HI>London,</HI>
the Deans and Bi&s;hops, asking them, Whether
by per&s;evering a good Prote&s;tant, and living
well, &s;he &s;hould Infallibly be &s;aved? To which
<PB N="52" REF="39">
&s;he &s;aith, they gave her only this An&s;wer,
That they hoped, that by the goodne&s;s of God,
and the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;he &s;hould be
&s;o. This &s;o mode&s;t and rational an An&s;wer,
was not &s;ufficient to confirm the Gentlewo|man.
The Je&s;uits were not wanting to ob|&s;erve
to her, that the Bi&s;hops had &s;aid to her, <HI>we
hope,</HI> which did expre&s;s nothing of Certainty
or A&s;&s;urance; but that as for them, they a&s;&s;u|red
her, that &s;he &s;hould Infallibly be Saved in
the Roman Catholick Religion.</P>
<P>Indeed it is not ea&s;y for me to believe, that
&s;o pitiful an Argument &s;hould have been capa|ble
to per&s;wade a Gentlewoman, who other|wi&s;e
&s;eems to have Wit enough; and that in
all probability, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome o|ther
motive of Intere&s;t lurking, more &s;trong
than all this, and that &s;ome Promi&s;e had been
given her, of the advancement of her Hus|band
in King <HI>James</HI> his Court. In the mean
time, he is at pre&s;ent in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where not|with&s;tanding
all the fair Promi&s;es the Je|&s;uits
may have given him, he is fain to live
on hopes.</P>
<P><HI>That I may not run out into a long Digre&s;|&s;ion,
having now repre&s;ented to you the or|der
and method of the Studies of the Je&s;uits,
I &s;hall pa&s;s over to the Studies of the other
Religious Orders, which I &s;hall comprize in
few words, that I may not be tedious to you
by an over-long Relation. Tho&s;e of the&s;e
Orders, who profe&s;s a &s;trict and au&s;tere Rule,
<PB N="53" REF="39">
complain that the Rigor of their ob&s;ervance
exhau&s;ts and flats their Spirits, and makes them
in a manner wholly incapable of applying them|&s;elves
to Study, and that their time is too much
&s;hortned by that, which they call the</HI> Divine
Office, <HI>to be able to do any good at it.</HI> How
is it po&s;&s;ible for me to Study? <HI>&s;aid a Reformed
Religious to me,</HI> I mu&s;t ri&s;e at midnight to go to
Mattins, which continue two hours and an half.
After which I return to my Cell, to &s;ee if I can
take &s;ome re&s;t, my Head being much di&s;ordered,
with the un&s;ea&s;onable breaking of it: About an
hour or two after, I am fain to ri&s;e again, to go
and meditate, and &s;ing that which they call <HI>Prime.</HI>
This done, we are &s;ent to Work in a Garden,
there to Dig and Delve for near two hours more;
after which we mu&s;t go to &s;ing the <HI>Terce,</HI> and High
Ma&s;s. This done, we go to Dinner, which is fol|lowed
with an hour of Recreation; the re&s;t of the
Day, is taken up in going three times more to the
Church, there to &s;ing the <HI>Nones, Ve&s;pers</HI> and <HI>Com|plies,</HI>
&s;o that we can never have three quarters of
an hour together to our &s;elves. For my part, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> I render thanks to God, that I under&s;tood a
little Latin, before I ever entred into this Religi|ous
Order, which makes me at pre&s;ent to under|&s;tand
a little of my Breviary; but the mo&s;t of my
Brethren &s;carcely under&s;tand one word of it, and
&s;ing like &s;o many A&s;&s;es, without knowing what
they &s;ay; and much le&s;s do they know what Phi|lo&s;ophy
or Theology meaneth. They &s;ay that the&s;e
kind of Studies are very dangerous to Salvation,
<PB N="54" REF="40">
and fill Men with Pride and Vanity. For our parts,
we are &s;ure that by obeying our Superiors, we &s;hall
go to Paradi&s;e, without troubing our Heads before|hand,
to know what kind of place it is. <HI>This
was the Rea&s;oning of this poor Monk; and
he was &s;o far from lamenting, as he ought,
the Mi&s;ery of his Condition, which deprived
him of &s;o great a Trea&s;ure, as is that which is
the product of Study, that he in&s;ulted over,
and de&s;pis'd Learning; it being but too natural
to the mo&s;t part of Men, to endeavour to
aba&s;e and undervalue that, out of a kind of
maliciou&s;ne&s;s of heart, which their folly or
weakne&s;s will not &s;uffer them to obtain.</HI></P>
<P>But fora&s;much as there are but few Religi|ous
Orders in <HI>Italy,</HI> where this exact Ob&s;ervance
is practi&s;ed; &s;o we find other Religious, who
have much more time to them&s;elves, and that
are altogether of a different humour. And
fora&s;much as the mo&s;t part of the&s;e, are either
of the Order of S. <HI>Dominick,</HI> or S. <HI>Francis,</HI> we
may with re&s;pect to their Doctrin, di|vide
them into <HI>Thomi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Scoti&s;ts.</HI> The for|mer
of the&s;e, follow the Doctrin of S. <HI>Thomas
Aquinas,</HI> who was a <HI>Dominican.</HI> This <HI>Thomas</HI>
&s;tuck clo&s;e to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in matters of Philo&s;o|phy,
and &s;tudied his Divinity at <HI>Collen,</HI> under
<HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> of the &s;ame Order. He un|dertook
afterwards, by the &s;ubtilty of his Spi|rit,
to reconcile <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> with S. <HI>Paul,</HI> forcing
that Pagan Philo&s;opher in a manner, to be|come
a Chri&s;tian, and what is yet more won|derful,
<PB N="55" REF="40">
a Papi&s;t, in &s;pite of all the aver&s;ion he
had to the&s;e novel Doctrins.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was fallen into great Decadence,
and Neglect in S. <HI>Thomas</HI> his time, and 'tis to
him therefore, they attribute the Glory of
having as it were, rai&s;ed him from the Dead,
according to that &s;aying, <HI>Sine Thoma mutus
Ari&s;toteles, Without</HI> Thomas, Ari&s;totle <HI>is Dumb.</HI>
Having addicted him&s;elf very much to the
reading of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> he could not avoid <HI>gratui|tous
Prede&s;tination,</HI> nor <HI>efficacious Grace,</HI> which
he &s;trongly maintained, &s;hewing him&s;elf very
inventive and dexterous at &s;plitting a Hair in
his way of handling Schola&s;tick matters, and
particularly the Points that re&s;pect <HI>Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation.</HI></P>
<P>Pope <HI>Urban</HI> IV. who in&s;tituted the Fea&s;t of
the Holy Sacrament, ordered him to apply
him&s;elf to the compo&s;ing of an Office for it.
The Papi&s;ts greatly admire the Hymn, he
made on that Subject, and more particularly
the Pro&s;e, which to this day is Sung at the
Ma&s;s. It is full of the Rap&s;odies and contra|dictions,
which the Papi&s;ts at pre&s;ent do be|lieve
on that Subject. And he him&s;elf owns,
about the mid&s;t of the &s;aid Pro&s;e, that what
he &s;aith of it is incomprehen&s;ible, doth not
fall under the Sen&s;es, and is contrary to, or
beyond the order of natural things.</P>
<Q><PB N="56" REF="41">
<L>Quod non capis, quod non vides,</L>

<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed how he dur&s;t a&s;&s;ert that it is
Faith alone, that a&s;&s;ures us of it; for as &s;ubtil
as he was, 'tis evident that in his Searching,
he him&s;elf was very doubtful, whether what
he had writ on this Subject, was true or no.
This Pa&s;&s;age of his &s;eems too remarkable to be
pa&s;t by, without giving you an occa&s;ion of
making &s;ome Reflexion upon it. To this pur|po&s;e
I &s;hall relate to you, what <HI>Ribadeneira</HI>
tells us of it, in his <HI>Legends,</HI> in the Life of
S. <HI>Thomas Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, &s;aith he, S. <HI>Thomas</HI> in his
Explication of other matters, goes beyond all other
Doctors; yet in the point of this ineffable Sacra|ment
and Divine Sacrifice, he &s;urmounts and out|vies
him&s;elf, as may be &s;een in his Works, and in
the Office he compo&s;ed at the command of Pope
<HI>Urban IV.</HI> for the Celebration of the Fea&s;t of the
Holy Sacrament. This thorny and difficult Questi|on,
having been once canvas'd in the Univer&s;ity of
<HI>Paris,</HI> concerning the Accidents of Bread and Wine,
which continue there vi&s;ible after the Conver&s;ion of
the Sub&s;tance to which they belong, into that of the
<PB N="57" REF="41">
Body and Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and which
are called the Sacramental Species or Kinds: S <HI>Tho|mas,</HI>
(to whom they had all referr'd them&s;elves,)
writ to them his thoughts of this Que&s;tion, upon a
Paper, which he laid upon the Altar; and having
his Eyes and Heart fixed upon a Crucifix which was
there, he be&s;eeched him mo&s;t earne&s;tly, that if he
had writ the Truth, he would be plea&s;ed to do him
the Favour to tell it him; and if not, that he would
plea&s;e to &s;top and hinder it. And as he was in
the greate&s;t Fervour of his Prayer, Je&s;us Chri&s;t
&s;hewed him&s;elf vi&s;ibly unto him upon the Altar,
and &s;aid to him, You have writ this well, <HI>Thomas.</HI>
The Saint continuing his Prayer, being Pro&s;trate
on the Ground, his Body was lifted up into the
Air, and continued &s;o, hovering there for a good
while, in the Pre&s;ence of many Religious of the
Convent.</P>
<P>At another time, when he compo&s;ed the Office of
the Romi&s;h Church, which they &s;ing on the day of
the most Holy Sacrament, being then in the City
of <HI>Orvieto,</HI> a Crucifix &s;pake to him, the &s;ame
words, which Crucifix is to this day called S. <HI>Tho|mas</HI>
his Crucifix. The &s;ame hapned to him al&s;o at
<HI>Naples;</HI> as he was writing the Third part of his
Sum, the Crucifix which was upon the Altar, &s;pake
to him with a loud and intelligible Voice, &s;aying,
Thomas, <HI>thou ha&s;t well writ concerning me;
What will thou that I give thee for thy Re|ward?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="42">
Thus far are the Words of <HI>Ribadeneira</HI> the
Je&s;uit, in his Legend, which is &s;o highly ap|proved
by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Upon all
which, I de&s;ire you to make this Reflexion,
That if S. <HI>Thomas</HI> had not been doubtful of
what he wrote, he would not have had re|cour&s;e
to &s;o many Crucifixes, to be confirm'd
and a&s;&s;ur'd in his own mind; for otherwi&s;e it
would have been an open tempting of God,
as it would &s;urely be, if at pre&s;ent we &s;hould
de&s;ire Miracles of him, to prove to us the Re|&s;urrection
of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And if
S. <HI>Thomas</HI> doubted of this matter, it follows,
that he was convinced, that the&s;e things were
not &s;olidly ratified in the Go&s;pel, or in the
Doctrin of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> or at lea&s;t could not be
deduc'd thence, as natural and nece&s;&s;ary Con|&s;equences.
Wherefore then doth he &s;ay in his
Pro&s;e, <HI>Animo&s;a firmat Fides,</HI> that Faith con|firms
the&s;e matters? Men have begun in the&s;e
latter Ages, to recover a little from the&s;e Ap|paritions
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and from the&s;e
&s;peaking Crucifixes: But <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> had
Wit enough, at that time, to di&s;cern that his
novel Doctrin did &s;tand in need of &s;uch
Proofs. True it is al&s;o, that probably he
might have imagined it; for his a&s;&s;iduous Ap|plication
and Meditation of matters purely
Metaphy&s;ical, had made him extreamly ab|&s;tracted
and Hypocondriacal; and to make
u&s;e of the Expre&s;&s;ions of him, who hath com|po&s;ed
his Encomium, <HI>He was &s;o extatical and
<PB N="59" REF="42">
&s;o in&s;en&s;ible, that he &s;eemed rather a Statue than
a Man. In&s;omuch that whil&s;t he was a writing
his Books of the Trinity, a Candle burnt his hand,
without his feeling of it: And that which is yet
more wonderful is, that he fell into the&s;e Exta&s;ies
and Ravi&s;hments, how and when he would him|&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Author in mo&s;t pious Terms re|lates
a very plea&s;ant thing of him, and which
&s;hews the great ab&s;traction of Spirit, in which he
was at times. He &s;aith, that S. <HI>Thomas</HI> at a time,
&s;itting at Table with S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI>
who made him to Dine with him, out of the
great re&s;pect he bore to him and his Order;
without minding what he did, or in who&s;e
Company he was, he thump'd with his Hand
upon the Table, &s;aying, <HI>I am &s;ure, the</HI> Mani|chees
<HI>will never be able to an&s;wer this Argument.</HI>
The Prior who was there with him, pull'd
him by his Gown, and put him in mind that
he was at the King's Table; whereupon he
came to him&s;elf again, as one that was re|turned
from the other World, and asked Par|don
of the King for his Indi&s;cretion. This
puts me in mind of a like Action of his in Pre|&s;ence
of the Duke of <HI>Mantua;</HI> He had &s;wal|lowed
a Fly, and having almo&s;t immediately
let it e&s;cape again, he made a mo&s;t fearful
outcry, and a thou&s;and fru&s;traneous efforts to
catch it again, without con&s;idering that he
was in his Ma&s;ters Pre&s;ence. I don't pretend
by all this, to imply that <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> was
<PB N="60" REF="43">
a Fool; but on the contrary do affirm, that he
had a great &s;tock of Wit; yea, and it may be
was over-&s;tock'd with it; but withal, that he
had (as many topping Wits have) many bad
Intervals. The only thing I am a&s;toni&s;h'd at,
is, that they would needs make a Saint of him,
and extol that for an act of Heroical and
tran&s;cendent Vertue, which indeed was a for|mal
Di&s;obedience to the declared Will of his
Mother, and of tho&s;e that had the Authority
over him, and this when he was yet a young
Child. Moreover, I was willing by the way
to make this &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion, to give you &s;ome
kind of Idea of the Man, whom the Papi&s;ts
dignifie with the Name of <HI>The Angel of the
Schools; The Hammer of Hereticks, &amp;c.</HI> This is
he that is the Head of that great Party called
<HI>Thomists,</HI> whereof the chiefe&s;t are the <HI>Domi|nicans.</HI></P>
<P>Another Party, no whit le&s;s con&s;iderable, is
that of the <HI>Scotists. John Duns</HI> a <HI>Scotch-man,</HI>
and who upon that account was Sirnamed
<HI>Scotus,</HI> was the Head of them. He was of the
Order of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> and lived about the latter
end of the <HI>Fourteenth Century.</HI> He at fir&s;t fol|lowed
the Opinions of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and taught
them publickly: But his Scholars having one
day Reproached him, That he &s;aid nothing,
but what <HI>Thomas</HI> had &s;aid before him, <HI>Nihil
dicis quod non dixerit</HI> Thomas; he was touch'd
to the quick with this Reproof, and having a
good opinion of his own Ability, he told
<PB N="61" REF="43">
them, That for time to come they &s;hould
hear &s;uch things from him, as <HI>Thomas</HI> never
&s;aid. From that time forwards he affected to
contradict him in every thing: Becau&s;e <HI>Thomas</HI>
(for Example) was for <HI>Efficacious Grace,</HI> he
invented another &s;ort of Grace, which came
nearer to that of the <HI>Semi-Pelagians,</HI> than to
the Grace of S. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> whom <HI>Thomas</HI> followed
in this Point. And in the Sacrament, becau&s;e
<HI>Thomas</HI> would not have the Body of Chri&s;t
to be there with its natural Quantity, but only
after a definitive manner; <HI>Scotus</HI> a&s;&s;erted the
contrary, and &s;aid, That his Body was there
with its whole Quantity. But becau&s;e he dur&s;t
not &s;ave him&s;elf by maintaining, That the
Body of Chri&s;t in the Sacrament had an ex|ten&s;ion
of Place, as being repugnant to Sen&s;e
and Rea&s;on; his Subtilty put him upon in|venting
another &s;ort of Quantity, which he
determines to be an Exten&s;ion of Parts in
them&s;elves, <HI>Exten&s;io partium in ordine ad &s;e:</HI>
By which means he made the Generical Quan|tity
of the <HI>Thomi&s;ts,</HI> to be only a Species of his.
This Di&s;tinction indeed was very &s;ubtil; yea, &s;o
&s;ubtil, that probably <HI>Scotus</HI> did not under&s;tand
it him&s;elf. For how can it be conceived, that a
Body &s;hould be extended in it &s;elf, without
being &s;o with re&s;pect to Place? I have con|ver&s;ed
with many <HI>Scoti&s;t</HI> Doctors, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed
to hold this Opinion from their &s;ubtil
Doctor, yet had not Subtilty enough to explain
it. This &s;ame <HI>Scotus</HI> died, being only 35 years
of Age.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="44">
I do not pretend here to run through all
the Oppo&s;itions of his Doctrin to that of
<HI>S. Thomas.</HI> The only Reflexion I could wi&s;h
might be made upon it, is this, That the Popes
dare not declare them&s;elves more in favour of
the one than of the other, for fear of incen&s;ing
one of both the&s;e Parties, who are become &s;o
powerful in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> However
it is evident, that the&s;e Doctrins being diame|trically
oppo&s;it and contradictory one to the
other in mo&s;t of the Points, it's impo&s;&s;ible they
&s;hould be both true, and con&s;equently one of
tho&s;e great Parties mu&s;t needs be in an Error. The
<HI>Romi&s;h</HI> High Prie&s;ts, who boa&s;t them&s;elves to
be <HI>Infallible,</HI> ought (as it &s;eems to me) for the
Love alone which they owe to Truth, to
pronounce their Deci&s;ive Rules concerning
this kind of Controver&s;ies; but by Ill-hap the&s;e
two Parties are too &s;trong for them, and they
would be in danger by pulling down one of
them, to be them&s;elves buried under the Ruins.
They rather chu&s;e, &s;eeing both Parties do own
the Papal Authority, to let them both alone.
<HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;aid nothing concerning
<HI>Efficacious Grace</HI> and <HI>Free-Will,</HI> but what the
Di&s;ciples of S. <HI>Austin</HI> and the <HI>Thomi&s;ts</HI> held,
and &s;till hold to this day, tho' under Terms that
are &s;omewhat differing, but &s;ignifie the &s;ame
thing: Yet the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> condemned
the former, thereby endeavouring to aggravate
and to render odious (by the Citation of a
great number of Errors) per&s;ons that had
<PB N="63" REF="44">
lifted up them&s;elves again&s;t the Holy See.
<HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Scotus</HI> are not only different in
Opinions; but we find al&s;o, that their Fol|lowers
are at great Variance among&s;t them|&s;elves.
There are no le&s;s than three or four
&s;orts of <HI>Thomi&s;ts,</HI> who every one of them pre|tend
to have Rea&s;on on their &s;ide, in the Ex|plications
they put upon S. <HI>Thomas;</HI> and the
<HI>Scoti&s;ts</HI> do as much by their <HI>Scotus.</HI></P>
<P>What I have here related concerning tho&s;e
two Authors, and their Adherents, and what
before I mention'd concerning the <HI>Molini&s;ts,</HI>
or <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and the <HI>Augu&s;tinians,</HI> agrees gene|rally
to all tho&s;e who profe&s;s to follow them,
in what&s;oever Country they may be. But to
apply this more particularly to the <HI>Italians,</HI> I
&s;hall tell you, that they differ in nothing
from others on tho&s;e Points, &s;ave only in this,
That they do not trouble them&s;elves to &s;earch
to the bottom of them, except &s;ome particular
occa&s;ion, and where their own Glory, or
that of their Order is concerned, engage them
to it. They are too great lovers of their Re|po&s;e
and Plea&s;ures, to concern them&s;elves with
Theological Notions: And they are the Monks
that have invented that way of Di&s;puting
which I have mention'd, where I &s;peak of
their Univer&s;ities. They mu&s;t &s;hew them the
Arms they intend to fight them with, and
point them to the Parts they de&s;ign to make
their Thru&s;t at, that they may be &s;pared for
their own defence.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="45">
There hapned once upon this account a
great Di&s;order at <HI>Bononia,</HI> whil&s;t I was there:
A <HI>Dominican</HI> Father, who was a <HI>French</HI> Man,
had been de&s;ired to oppo&s;e in the Grand Con|vent
of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> at <HI>Bononia,</HI> where he
was arriv'd &s;ome days before from Foreign
Countries. He being not over-well acquainted
with their Cu&s;toms, after that he had cho&s;en
the <HI>The&s;es</HI> he would di&s;pute again&s;t, and com|municated
his Arguments, a de&s;ire took him
to change his <HI>Medium,</HI> which did &s;o extreamly
confound the poor Defendant, who was not
prepar'd for it, and who&s;e Stock was not
&s;ufficient to remedy &s;uch an unlook'd for Ac|cident,
that he An&s;wered quite wrong, and
&s;et all the Company a Laughing; re&s;embling
herein a certain per&s;on I have heard of, Who
being &s;ent to take his Orders, without under|&s;tanding
a word of Latin, and had only got
by Heart &s;o many An&s;wers in order, as the
Bi&s;hop (who was no Conjurer) was commonly
u&s;ed to ask Que&s;tions; but being confounded
in Mar&s;halling his An&s;wers, was at la&s;t reduc'd
to &s;ay, <HI>That he had the Devil in his Sleeve, in&s;tead
of his Letters Patents;</HI> which he &s;uppos'd the
Bi&s;hop had by his Que&s;tion demanded of him.
The &s;ame thing hapned to this poor <HI>Dominican,</HI>
who defended the <HI>The&s;es;</HI> but &s;oon after all,
the Storm fell upon the <HI>French-men.</HI> The
Scholars, who were all of them young Reli|gious,
were &s;o extreamly enrag'd at this
Affront, which they pretended to have been
<PB N="65" REF="45">
offer'd to their Colleague, that they had no
patience to &s;tay till the Di&s;pute was ended,
but run away from the place like &s;o many
Mad-men, to the Chamber of this poor Stran|ger,
and having broke down the Door, they
tore to pieces &s;everal Turbans of Silk, and
other Curio&s;ities he had brought with him
from <HI>Constantinople.</HI> After this, having watched
him at the Door of the Hall, where the Di&s;|putation
had been held, One of them, as he
came forth, gave him a great Box on the Ear;
telling him, <HI>He had best learn another time, to
put his Arguments in Form and Figure.</HI> See here
in the mean time, the Inconveniences to which
the <HI>Italians</HI> expo&s;e them&s;elves. They are the
<HI>Monks</HI> al&s;o who have introduced Fea&s;ts at the
end of their Di&s;putes, and the &s;umptuous
Adorning of the Hall where they are cele|brated;
and in the&s;e Particulars indeed it is
they &s;urpa&s;s all others.</P>
<P>It may generally be &s;aid of the <HI>Italians,</HI>
That they are never excellent in tho&s;e Studies
that require a con&s;tant and &s;erious Applica|tion;
as on the contrary, there be very few
can equal them in all others, which of them|&s;elves
do afford Diver&s;ion and Plea&s;ure. The
greate&s;t part of <HI>Monks</HI> in the Convents apply
them&s;elves to learn to Sing, or Play upon
In&s;truments: Some addict them&s;elves to Poetry,
in order to make Compo&s;itions and Sonnets in
Prai&s;e of their Saints, which they expo&s;e on
Fe&s;tivals in their Churches; and they are won|derful
<PB N="66" REF="46">
good at it. In the Abby of S. <HI>Michael
in the Wood,</HI> where I Taught at <HI>Bononia,</HI> the
Abbot &s;ent for a Dancing and a Fencing-Ma&s;ter,
to teach his Religious. I thought this
very &s;trange for <HI>Monks;</HI> and one day I took
the freedom to declare my Thoughts of it to
the Abbot. The Prelat An&s;wered me, That
there was no hurt in all this, and that they did
it for a good End. <HI>For</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>in the first
place, we &s;ometimes act &s;ome little Tragedies and
Comedies in the Vestry, or in the Church, to which
we Invite our Kindred of both Sexes, and our
Friends, to be merry together. Now, you know
very well, that in the Interludes there is alway
expected &s;omething of Boufonry; and &s;ometimes a
little Ball, or a French-Dance, are very agreeable
to the Ladies; and indeed, if a man cannot Dance
well, he expo&s;eth him&s;elf to Laughter, and our
Colleagues become the le&s;s esteemed, who being all
of them Children of Per&s;ons of Quality, ought
not upon that very account to be ignorant of this
kind of genteel Exerci&s;es.</HI> The Abbot in giving me
this account, took notice of &s;ome &s;ort of In|dignation
on my Brow when he told me, that
they made u&s;e of the Church to act their
Farces and Comedies in; and therefore would
needs excu&s;e him&s;elf on that Point, by telling
me, That they were in a manner forc'd to &s;erve
them&s;elves of that place, becau&s;e the Ladies
were not &s;uffer'd to enter the Convent, &s;o
that they had no other place where to be&s;tow
them; as if for&s;ooth it were a ca&s;e of ab&s;o|lute
<PB N="67" REF="46">
and in&s;uperable nece&s;&s;ity for the Ladies to
be pre&s;ent, or for them to act &s;uch kind of
Follies. Sometimes al&s;o they are guilty of
mo&s;t horrible Profanations, by building their
Theatre upon the High-Altar where their
Holy Sacrament is lodg'd.</P>
<P>The Abbot further endeavouring to &s;atisfie
me, pa&s;t over to another Rea&s;on, which ap|pear'd
&s;omewhat more witty. <HI>My Religious,</HI>
&s;aid he, <HI>have all of them (as you know) great
Pen&s;ions, and we cannot hinder them from &s;pending
their Mony, as they plea&s;e them&s;elves. Now, I
&s;hould be very loath, that they &s;hould employ it (as
&s;o many others do) in keeping their Whores: This
is that which makes me ca&s;t about continually, by
what means I may mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly get it out of
their hands without offending them, by making
them expend it upon other u&s;es. 'Tis in this view
that I exhort them, to learn all manner of Exer|ci&s;es;
as to Dance, to Ride the Great Hor&s;e, and
to handle their Arms. They pay their Ma&s;ters
them&s;elves, and by this means their Pur&s;es are
drained.</HI> The Abbot &s;uppos'd he had found a
very plau&s;ible pretext, for allowing his Monks
this liberty; tho' in the mean time others in
the City openly flouted at it, as finding good
rea&s;on to be again&s;t the Religious, &s;pending
their time in Exerci&s;es &s;o little becoming Mo|na&s;tick
Gravity. It is to be ob&s;erved, that all
the&s;e young Religious were then engaged in a
cour&s;e of Studies, but it was not po&s;&s;ible to
keep them intent upon them; and &s;carcely
<PB N="68" REF="47">
with all the pains taking in the World was it
po&s;&s;ible to bring them to any thing, &s;o &s;trangly
were they taken up with their vain Exerci&s;es.
See here in what manner the <HI>Italian</HI> Youth
&s;pend their time in the Cloi&s;ters; and without
doubt at this rate, they cannot but &s;tand in
need of having the Arguments of their Op|ponents
communicated to them, before they
come to Di&s;pute again&s;t them on publick Oc|ca&s;ions.
I &s;hould &s;carce ever make an end,
&s;hould I go about to relate all the ridiculous
Occupations that divert them from their Stu|dies.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hut up this Treati&s;e of Studies with
tho&s;e of &s;ome Secular Prie&s;ts, who never
having had the means or inclination to go
and &s;tudy at the Univer&s;ities, are forced, or
willing to content them&s;elves with that which
they have learnt with the Je&s;uits. The &s;horte&s;t
way they have to arrive at their end, which
is to be Ordained Prie&s;ts, is to get by Heart a
little Book called, <HI>Examen Ordinandorum,</HI> the
<HI>Examen of tho&s;e who are to be Ordained;</HI> which
contains the ordinary Que&s;tions that are put
to tho&s;e that de&s;ire to enter into Orders.
The mo&s;t part of them learn this like Parots,
without under&s;tanding the &s;en&s;e of it; being
a&s;&s;ured, that no other things &s;hall be asked
them. For Ignorance hath &s;o far prevailed in
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that none at the&s;e Exami|nations
are put to it, to &s;hew their Scholar&s;hip.
And the&s;e Men being once Ordain'd, would
<PB N="69" REF="47">
rather be Hang'd (&s;o to &s;ay) than ever
after look in a Latin Book, except the <HI>Mi&s;&s;al</HI>
and their <HI>Breviary;</HI> and yet it is a rare thing
to find any that are able to explain them.
They abandon the Trade of Preaching to
the Monks, as I have already declared in my
LETTERS; and for their part, they content
them&s;elves to &s;ay their Ma&s;&s;es, to gad to Bap|ti&s;ms,
and Burials.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, and a thing known to all
<HI>Italy,</HI> that Bi&s;hopricks and good Benefices, Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Employments and Offices are not
be&s;towed upon Men of Learning; but upon
tho&s;e who have mo&s;t Friends, who can be&s;t
plea&s;e and flatter, or who being Rich, are in
a condition to make the be&s;t advances. The
ca&s;e is very different in <HI>England,</HI> where the
Bi&s;hops, and other Dignitaries, are only cho&s;en
from among&s;t the Doctors, and where their Me|rit
is chiefly con&s;idered. This is the true Rea&s;on
why the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of <HI>Rome</HI> do &s;o little care
or endeavour to get Learning, as being well
a&s;&s;ured that it will &s;tand them in no &s;tead at
all; yea, that their Enemies or Competitors
might take occa&s;ion from thence, to render
them &s;u&s;pected. The Abbot with whom I
Travelled the Fir&s;t Days Journy to <HI>Veletre,</HI>
inform'd me of nothing, but what I knew
before, by the de&s;cription he gave me of the
way of conferring Bi&s;hopricks and Benefices,
which commonly fell to the &s;hare of the mo&s;t
Ignorant. I only asked him, what might be
<PB N="70" REF="48">
the Rea&s;on of this great Di&s;order? To which
he An&s;wer'd, That he did not know, or rather
dur&s;t not tell it me: And for my part, neither
dur&s;t I tell him my Thoughts about it in that
Country. But now, that by the Grace of God
I may freely &s;peak my Mind, I &s;hall declare,
that the greate&s;t Secret of all this is, the Re&s;olu|tion
which the Heads of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church
have taken, to keep the People committed to
their Charge, as much as they can in a profound
Ignorance. The Doctrin of that Church is &s;o
extreamly corrupt; the Contradictions it con|tains
are &s;o great and many; the Decrees of
the New Councils and Popes, and the Doctrins
of their different Religious Orders are &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent
and irreconcilable one with the o|ther;
the u&s;e, or rather the commerce and
Trade that is made there of Holy things, or
&s;uch as are pretended to be &s;o, is &s;o ba&s;e and
infamous; the Morals they profe&s;s are &s;o low,
wicked and unworthy, that there is no other
way left to keep that Church &s;tanding, but by
aba&s;ing the Spirits of Men by Ignorance, or
rather by wholly blinding of them, to make
them fall into the Aby&s;s of Error. Now the
be&s;t Expedient in order to this is, to make clear
work with what&s;oever might encourage the
Studies of Learning, and to &s;et over the People
Ignorant Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors; from which God
pre&s;erve all Prote&s;tant Churches, and more
e&s;pecially that of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS

JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Second Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>BEing Come to <HI>Veletre,</HI> the <HI>Abbot</HI> took
up his Lodging with one of his Friends,
and I betook my &s;elf to an Inn, near
the <HI>Piazza.</HI> My Ho&s;t asked me if I had not
a mind to &s;ee the Ceremony, which was to
be Celebrated the next day at the <HI>Dome,</HI> (&s;o
they call the Cathedral Churches in <HI>Italy;)</HI> he
<PB N="72" REF="49">
told me, there was a great Bell to be Baptized,
whereof a great Lord was to be the God-Fa|ther,
and a Lady of Quality, the God-Mother,
and that there would be a great apperance of
the Nobility, who had been Invited to the So|lemnity
from all Parts. I had before this
&s;een Bells Baptized in <HI>France,</HI> but becau&s;e I
knew that the <HI>Italians</HI> &s;urpa&s;s all other Nati|ons
in the Magnificence of their Ceremonies,
and that they commonly &s;ea&s;on them with a
double proportion of Super&s;tition; I re&s;olv'd
with my &s;elf to &s;ee it Baptized, and with that
de&s;ign I &s;taid all the next day at <HI>Veletre.</HI> I
went to the Church in the Morning, to take a
view of the Preparatives, that had taken up a
whole Weeks time, which I found to be great
and Sumptuous indeed. The Bell was placed
at the Lower end of the Body of the Church,
hanging upon two Gudgeons, covered with
rich Hangings of Velvet, of a Violet Colour,
and the Bell it &s;elf, was accoutred with a
kind of Robe of the &s;ame Stuff. There were
two Theaters Built on each &s;ide of it, for the
Mu&s;icians, and an Amphitheater for the La|dies,
who were to be pre&s;ent at the Ceremony.
The Pillars and Walls of the Church were
richly adorned, with curious &s;heets of Silk,
and Pictures. Near to the Bell, was Erected
an Altar, very neatly &s;et forth, and upon it
lay a white Satin Robe, which was to be put
upon the Bell, as &s;oon as it &s;hould be Baptiz|ed,
with a great and fair Garland of choice
<PB N="73" REF="49">
Flowers: There was al&s;o upon the Altar a Ro|man
Ritual, a Cen&s;er, and a Ve&s;&s;el with Holy
Water, and round about the Altar, rich Vel|vet
Elbow-Chairs, for the Prie&s;ts, who were
to perform the Ceremony. Ju&s;t over-again&s;t
it, a Throne was &s;een mo&s;t Magnificently
Hung, for the God-Father and God-Mother
of the Bell. About Ten of the Clock the
Company came, and having taken their &s;eve|ral
Places, the Prie&s;ts began their Function.
He who officiated was a Bi&s;hop <HI>in partibus,</HI>
whom the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Veletre,</HI> being at that
time very Sick, had deputed for this purpo&s;e,
and his Chair was placed upon the Steps of
the high Altar. He &s;truck up the fir&s;t P&s;alm,
which was continued by the Mu&s;ick. The&s;e
P&s;alms, by the way, which may be &s;een in
the Roman Ritual, have as much reference to
the Baptizing of a Bell, as to the Baptizing of
the Moon; the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> very proba|bly
having never had the lea&s;t notion of the
Bapti&s;m of Bells. After that the P&s;alms were
ended, the Bi&s;hop began the Ble&s;&s;ing of Holy
Water, to Sanctifie it in the fir&s;t place, to the
end that afterwards it might Sanctifie the Bell
al&s;o. This Benediction is very long, and no
le&s;s Ridiculous; which being Fini&s;hed, the Bi|&s;hop
and Prie&s;ts dipt Spunges in it, with which
they rub'd over the Bell, from the top to the
bottom, within and without, being in this re|gard,
certainly much better Baptized, than
Children are, upon who&s;e Heads only they
<PB N="74" REF="50">
pour or &s;prinkle a little of it. They repeated
in the mean time abundance of Prayers, which
&s;peak of nothing el&s;e but Heavenly Ble&s;&s;ings,
that are to Purifie, Sanctifie, and Con&s;ecrate
the Bell; <HI>Ut hoc Tintinnabulum,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>coe|le&s;ti
Benedictione perfundere, purificare, &s;anctifi|care
&amp; con&s;ecrare digneris. That thou wouldest
be plea&s;ed to Rin&s;e, Purifie, Sanctifie, and
Con&s;ecrate this Bell, with thy Heavenly Benedicti|on.</HI>
The Bell being thus well wa&s;ht, they dri|ed
it with clean Napkins; and the Bi&s;hop
having taken the Viol of Holy Oils, which
are tho&s;e they ble&s;s on Holy Thur&s;day, for
the whole year following, he therewith a|nointed
the Cro&s;s of Metal, which is on the
top of the Bell, in order to make the Devils
flee at the Sound or Ringing of it: <HI>Ut hoc au|dientes
Tintinnabulum tremi&s;cant &amp; fugiant, ante
Crucis in eo depictum vexillun: That hearing this Bell
they may tremble and flee, before the Banner of
the Cro&s;s de&s;igned upon it.</HI> He afterwards made
&s;even other Cro&s;&s;es with the &s;aid Oil, upon
the out&s;ide of the Bell, and four on the in&s;ide.
This done, he made the God-Father and God-Mother
draw near, and demanded of them
in <HI>Italian,</HI> Whether they were the Per&s;ons
that Pre&s;ented this Bell to be Con&s;ecrated?
Who having an&s;wered that they did; he then
asked them, Whether the Metal of the Bell,
and the Workman&s;hip of it, had been paid
for to the Artificers? To which they an&s;wer|ed,
Yea. They make this demand, becau&s;e it
<PB N="75" REF="50">
hath &s;ometime hapned, that for want of Pay|ment,
the Workmen have &s;eiz'd and fetch'd
away their Bells, the very &s;ame day, or the
day after it hath been Baptized, and have
melted them down, to be employed to Pro|fane
u&s;es. The third Que&s;tion he asked of
them, was, Whether they believed all that
the Catholick, Apo&s;tolick, Roman Church
believes, concerning the Holine&s;s and Virtue
of Bells? The an&s;wer to which was affirma|tive
al&s;o. In the La&s;t place, he demanded
of them, what Name they de&s;ired &s;hould be
put upon the Bell? To which the Lady an|&s;wered,
<HI>Mary.</HI> Then the Bi&s;hop took two
great &s;ilk Ribbands, which had been fa&s;tned
to the Gudgeons of the Bell, and gave each
of them one in their Hands, and pronounced
with a Loud Intelligible Voice, the words of
Con&s;ecration, which are the&s;e: <HI>Con&s;ecretur &amp;
Sanctificetur Signum i&s;tud, in nomine Patris &amp; Filii
&amp; Spiritus Sancti,</HI> Amen. <HI>Let this Sign be Con&s;e|crated
and Sanctified in the name of the Father, Son,
amd Holy Gho&s;t, Amen.</HI> Then turning him|&s;elf
to the People, he &s;aid, The Name of this
Bell is <HI>Mary.</HI> Afterwards he takes the Cen&s;er,
and Cen&s;eth it on the out-&s;ide round about,
and afterwards put the Cen&s;er under the Bell,
filling it with Sacred Fumes, and repeating all
this while Prayers and Invocations, that it
might be filled with the Dew of the Holy Spi|rit.
<HI>Tu hoc Tintinnabulum Spiritus Sancti rore
perfunde, ut ante &s;onitum illius &s;emper fugiat Bono|rum
<PB N="76" REF="51">
Inimicus. Do thou all be&s;prinkle this Bell
with the Dew of thy Holy Spirit, that at the &s;ound
of it, the Enemy of all good may always take his
Flight.</HI> The Office was carried on with a
great number of P&s;alms, which they repeated;
the Mu&s;ick all the while performing wonders;
and then the Bi&s;hop, for to &s;hut up the whole
Ceremony, arrayed the Bell with the white
Robe of a Pro&s;elyte or Convert, and with a
loud Voice read the Go&s;pel of <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Mar|tha:</HI>
I &s;uppo&s;ed at that time, that the rea&s;on
of their reading this Go&s;pel, was, becau&s;e the
Bell was called <HI>Mary;</HI> but I have &s;een &s;ince
in the Roman Ritual, that the &s;ame Go&s;pel is
read at the Con&s;ecration of all Bells, what&s;o|ever
their Names be. This is that I am a&s;to|ni&s;ht
at, becau&s;e that Go&s;pel hath no reference
at all to the Ceremony. The whole Solemni|ty
being thus ended, the Bi&s;hop gave his Bene|diction,
and the Prie&s;ts received great Pre|&s;ents
from the God-Father and God-Mother.</P>
<P>The Doctrin of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> con|cerning
Bells, may be reduced to the follow|ing
Points. The Fir&s;t is, that they have Me|rit,
and pray God for the Living and the
Dead. Secondly, That they do produce, by
a Divine Virtue conferr'd upon them, Devo|tion
in the Hearts of Believers. Thirdly,
That they drive away Storms and Tempe&s;ts;
and in the Fourth place, drive away Devils.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="51">
Before that I run over the&s;e four Points,
Ile tell you a Story that hapned at <HI>Bononia,</HI>
and is of &s;ufficient Antiquity, tho' the memo|ry
thereof be &s;till pre&s;erved fre&s;h and entire.
They had been Baptizing a Bell in the Church
of S. <HI>Proculo,</HI> which is an Abby of <HI>Benedictines,</HI>
and after all the Ceremonies, Benedictions and
Prayers, <HI>that the Bell might do good to all, and
hurt to no body;</HI> the fir&s;t time of the Ringing
of it, it fell upon the poor Sacri&s;tan or Sex|ton,
that Rung it, and who had taken more
care and pains for the Solemn Baptizing of it,
than to get it well hung and fa&s;tned, and broke
his Neck, together with it &s;elf into a thou&s;and
pieces. The Name of the Sacri&s;tan was <HI>Pro|culus,</HI>
and this ingenious Di&s;tick was made to
Celebrate the Memory of this Accident,
which at this day is found Engraved upon a
Stone, of a Foot Square, near to the Church
Door, where the thing hapned.</P>
<Q><L>Si procul &agrave; Proculo Proculi Campana fui&s;&s;et:</L>
<L>I am procul &agrave; Proculo, Proculus ip&s;e foret.</L></Q>
<P>The agreeablene&s;s of this Ver&s;e cannot be
rendred in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e of the Adverb
<HI>Procul,</HI> which in our Language is not the &s;ame,
and therefore will not comport with the allu|&s;ion;
but the Sen&s;e of it, as well as it can be
rendred is this: If the Bell of S. <HI>Proculus</HI> had
been far from <HI>Proculus, Proculus</HI> would at pre|&s;ent
<PB N="78" REF="52">
be far from <HI>Proculus,</HI> that is, he would not
as yet have been Buried in that place.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the four Prerogatives,
that are attributed to Bells, by tho&s;e of the
Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;eems to me to
&s;mell too rank of Intere&s;t, to be &s;o ea&s;ily
&s;wallowed. I &s;hall not take up my time to
prove to you, that an in&s;en&s;ible and material
thing is incapable of either Merit or Prayer;
my de&s;ign having never been to prove what I
&s;et down, by Theological Arguments, but only
to alledge matters of Fact. If indeed they
Rung their Bells for nought, the Doctrin of
<HI>Rome</HI> might in&s;inuate it &s;elf with more ap|pearance
of Truth: But a Man mu&s;t pay &s;o
dear, to be partaker of their Merit and Prayers,
that it mars the Plot; and I know not why
the Prie&s;ts and Monks &s;hould not &s;cruple this
Simonio. There are little, midling and great
Bells, and the Mony to be paid for the Ring|ing
of them, encrea&s;es proportionably to the
bigne&s;s of the Bells. There is all the rea&s;on
in the World indeed, that the Per&s;ons that
Ring them &s;hould be paid; but why the Prie&s;ts
&s;hould over and above this, receive a con&s;ide|rable
Sum of Mony, I &s;ee not. Is it not evi|dent
that this is &s;ome of the Fruit and Reve|nue
of their novel Doctrin? It &s;eems they
would fain introduce among&s;t us a new Go&s;|pel,
according to which &s;carcely any but the
Rich &s;hould be &s;aved, fora&s;much as none but
they, are in a Condition to pay well for the
<PB N="79" REF="52">
Graces of God, which the&s;e Men tell us they
have at their di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>When a Poor Man dies in <HI>Italy,</HI> they bury
him without ever Ringing a Bell, or &s;aying
any Ma&s;s for him, except any one out of
Charity will be at the Charges of it for him.
They &s;ay the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts do (as to this par|ticular)
outvy the <HI>Italians</HI> in Covetou&s;ne&s;s;
and Per&s;ons who have been in <HI>Spain</HI> have
a&s;&s;ur'd me, That when a Poor Man dies, they
expo&s;e his Body in the mo&s;t frequented Street
and Thorough-fare of the City, to the end
that the People who go and come, may ca&s;t
in &s;ome Pieces of Mony for their Interment.
The Prie&s;ts come ever and anon to &s;ee, whe|ther
the whole Sum be gathered; and, if they
&s;hould find &s;o much as one Penny wanting,
they would leave the Body there, to &s;tink and
infect the place, without ever offering to touch
it. See here to what a &s;trange height of Shame
and Infamy Popery hath reduc'd things! I
mean by Popery, all that new Me&s;s of Do|ctrins,
which only tends to fill the Pur&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Point of Doctrin, which is this,
<HI>That the Sound of Bells increa&s;eth the Devotion of
the Faithful,</HI> is built on the &s;ame Foundation
as the former, <HI>viz.</HI> Covetou&s;ne&s;s and ba&s;e
Avarice, or rather downright Rapin and Rob|bery.
The more Bells that are Rung at a
Chri&s;tning, and the longer time they are
Rung, the greater portion of Grace doth the
<PB N="80" REF="53">
Infant receive: The more Bells, and the
longer they are rung at a Marriage, the greater
&s;hare do the Married Couple obtain of the
Grace of Conjugal Love: The more Bells are
rung at a Burial, and the longer they are rung,
the greater Refre&s;hment and Ventilation doth
the Soul of the Departed receive in the Flames
of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> and the &s;ooner is delivered from
them: The more Bells are rung on a Holy|day,
and the longer time the Ringing is con|tinued,
the more the Per&s;ons that come to
Church are made partakers of Heavenly
Graces and Ble&s;&s;ings. But withal it is to be
noted, that all the&s;e <HI>mores</HI> cannot be obtained
without <HI>more Mony.</HI></P>
<P>Proceed we to the Third Point, which is
this, <HI>That Bells (by the Grace which is infu&s;ed
into them at their Bapti&s;mal-Con&s;ecration) have
the vertue of di&s;&s;ipating Thunder, of laying High
Winds, driving away Tempests, and calming of
Storms.</HI> There is never a thing in Nature
which produceth any effect, never &s;o little
beyond what is common, but the Papi&s;ts will
needs make a Miracle of it. The Sound of
Bells, by &s;triking the Air, doth &s;ometimes
di&s;&s;ipate the Clouds; but &s;ometimes al&s;o it
&s;plits or breaks them, and makes the Thunder
to fall upon the very Churches or Steeples
where they are rung, as when a Cloud chan|ceth
to be directly hovering over them. The
former of the&s;e effects is a Miracle with the
<PB N="81" REF="53">
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Prie&s;ts &s;erve them|&s;elves
of it, to give credit to the Benedictions
they be&s;tow upon their Bells; notwith&s;tanding
that it is very evident at the &s;ame time, that
the Thunder lights oftner upon Steeples, than
upon any other places, and &s;ometimes melts all
the Bells, which, one would think, might be
&s;ufficient to &s;top their Mouths for ever on this
Point. There is a Little Bell at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the
Convent of <HI>Capucins</HI> in the <HI>Judeca,</HI> which has
the Vogue of being &s;o miraculous again&s;t Tem|pe&s;ts;
and the People are &s;o Super&s;titiou&s;ly
po&s;&s;e&s;t with it, that when there is the lea&s;t
Storm, if the <HI>Capucins</HI> &s;hould chance to neg|lect
to ring it, the People would not fail to
be&s;iege them in their Convent, and cut them
in pieces. And to the end that all may be
attributed to the Merit of this Bell, they do
not ring it all out, but only Toll it, &s;o that
between each Toll a Man may repeat the
Lord's Prayer three or four times.</P>
<P>It remains, that I &s;peak one word of the
Fourth Vertue, which is that of <HI>Cha&s;ing away
Devils.</HI> A Religious <HI>Benedictin</HI> of the Congre|gation
of <HI>S. Maurus</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> once related to
me a Story, which evidently proves the con|trary.
It was then not above Three years
ago &s;ince it hapned in a Mona&s;tery, where he
was at that time. The&s;e Monks ri&s;e at Two
of the Clock in the Morning, to go and &s;ing
their Mattins and Morning Song. The Devil,
<PB N="82" REF="54">
or &s;ome Hobgoblin it &s;eems, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the Bell, and u&s;ed to Ring the Fir&s;t
Peal, and never fail'd of doing it very exactly
at the Hour, without mi&s;&s;ing one Minute. He
continued this good Office to the Mona&s;tery
for Six years together, &s;o that the Monks found
them&s;elves rid of the trouble of Ringing it.
A va&s;t number of People from the Towns and
Villages thereabouts, believing it to be a Fable
that was told them, had the Curio&s;ity to come
and &s;ee this Bell, which Rung of it &s;elf at
Two of the Clock in the Morning, without
any one touching it; and they them&s;elves were
irreproachable Witne&s;&s;es of it. Now it hap|ned
one Night in Winter, that this officious
Devil rang his Bell three Hours &s;ooner than
ordinary. The Prior of the Mona&s;tery, who
was not yet gone to Bed, and was Writing of
Letters, took notice of the Irregularity; and
&s;pelling nothing of good from it, he went
immediately to the Door of the Church, where
he &s;taid for the Religious; who being waked
at the &s;ound of the Bell, and believing that
the time for their Devotions was come, went
to Mattins; but the Prior &s;ent them all back to
their Cells, without &s;uffering any one of them
to enter into the Church, telling them, That
he fear'd the Devil had a mind to play them
&s;ome unlucky Trick. Neither was he mi&s;taken
in his &s;urmi&s;e; for about half an Hour after
the Roof of the Quire fell down, and would
have buried them all in its Ruins, had they
<PB N="83" REF="54">
been there at that time to &s;ing their Mattins.
The Devil had &s;o well gue&s;s'd at the time
when that old Roof would fall, that he knew
the Hour and Moment thereof; &s;o that he
had not put him&s;elf upon performing this
good Office for them, but only with the
de&s;ign of doing them a great mi&s;chief, if the
Prior had not out-witted him.</P>
<P>To apply this to our Subject: We find here
that the Devil was &s;o far from being frighted
at the Ringing of the Bell, that he Rung it
him&s;elf, and made u&s;e of it for the bringing
about of his Malicious intent. Leave we then
this Super&s;tition of <HI>Bells</HI> to the Papi&s;ts, nor
let this hinder us from making u&s;e of them,
as commodious In&s;truments to call Believers
together, to &s;hew Re&s;pect to our Dead, and
to be made u&s;e upon occa&s;ion of Publick Re|joycings;
yet without believing they can make
us better, and without attributing to in&s;en&s;ible
things, the precious Aids and Helps of our
Salvation, which are the Graces which we
receive from God alone, by the Merits of our
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I feel an unexpre&s;&s;ible Joy
to &s;ee, that the Prote&s;tants of <HI>England</HI> have
&s;o far forgot the Super&s;titious Practices of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that it is at pre&s;ent a No|velty
and &s;trange thing to them, when they
are told of them: But on the other hand; I
cannot bear to &s;ee the Papi&s;ts take occa&s;ion
from this forgetfulne&s;s, to calumniate tho&s;e
who have a mind to write or &s;peak of tho&s;e,
<PB N="84" REF="55">
as &s;ome of them have done who have &s;aid,
That I had impos'd upon them, by relating
&s;everal Super&s;titions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
the Practice whereof they deny. Among&s;t
other things they have In&s;tanc'd in the Ble&s;&s;ing
of Eggs at <HI>Ea&s;ter:</HI> To which I An&s;wer, That
they might as well have given the Lye to their
<HI>Roman Ritual,</HI> where the &s;aid Formular of
Ble&s;&s;ing them is found at length in the&s;e terms:</P>
<P>Subveniat, quae&s;umus, Domine, tuae Benedictionis
Gratia, huic Ovorum Creaturae, ut Cibus &s;alubris
fiat Fidelibus tuis, in tuarum gratiarum actione
&s;umentibus, ob Re&s;urrectionem Domini no&s;tri Je&s;u
Chri&s;ti, qui tecum vivit &amp; regnat, &amp;c. Et
a&s;pergat Aqua Benedicta.</P>
<P>In Engli&s;h thus:</P>
<P>Let, we be&s;eech thee, O Lord, the Grace of
thy Ble&s;&s;ing &s;uccour this Creature <HI>Eggs,</HI> that it
may become whol&s;om Food to thy Faithful, recei|ving
them with giving Thanks to thee, for the
Re&s;urrection of our Lord Je&s;us Christ, who lives
and reigns with thee, &amp;c. And let him be&s;prinkle
them with Holy-Water.</P>
<P>In the &s;aid <HI>Ritual</HI> we meet with many other
Ble&s;&s;ings, which I have not mention'd, that
are never a whit le&s;s ridiculous. We find
there Ble&s;&s;ings for Hou&s;es, for Ships, for
Swords, for the New Fruits of the Earth, for
<PB N="85" REF="55">
the Nuptial Bed, for A&s;&s;es and for Hor&s;es, and
in a word, for all &s;orts of Bea&s;ts that are &s;ick.
And becau&s;e it's likely the Papi&s;ts might en|deavour
to per&s;uade People, that I had im|pos'd
upon them, as to this la&s;t in&s;tance. See
here the very words of it, as they are &s;ee
down in the Appendix of the <HI>Roman Ritual.</HI></P>
<P>Primo, Animalia a&s;pergantur Aqua Benedict&acirc;;
po&s;tea Sacerdos dicat,</P>
<P>Mi&s;ericordiam tuam, Domine, &s;upplices exoramus,
ut haec animalia, quae gravi infirmitate vexantur,
tu&acirc; Benedictione &s;anantur, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A&s;pergantur iterum Aqua Benedict&acirc;.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Bea&s;ts must be sprinkled with Holy
Water; and then let the Prie&s;t &s;ay,</P>
<P>We humbly implore thy Mercy, O Lord, that
the&s;e Living Creatures, which are troubled with
great Infirmity, may by thy Ble&s;&s;ing be healed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Let them again be &s;prinkled with Holy-Water.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that in their other Ble&s;&s;ings
they u&s;e but one A&s;per&s;ion of Holy-Water;
but that in this they u&s;e Two Sprinklings, the
one at the beginning, and the other at the
end of the Benediction. I cannot give you
any Rea&s;on for it, except it be, that the Bea&s;ts
being greater in bulk, &s;eem to them therefore
to &s;tand in need of a greater Sanctification.
It will not now be look'd upon as a &s;trange
thing, what Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> hath writ in his Letters
concerning the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="56">
which he &s;aw in <HI>Italy,</HI> having here given you
the Authentick Form of it, which the Papi&s;ts
cannot deny.</P>
<P>There is another Ob&s;ervance in the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is &s;till more ridiculous than
this, which is their Exorci&s;ing of <HI>Rats, Cater|pillars,
Flies,</HI> and all other In&s;ects between the
Fea&s;ts of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion.</HI> I my &s;elf have
a&s;&s;i&s;ted very often, both in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> to
the performing of this Ceremony; and herein
I can &s;ay, that I have been among the number
of Fools: True it is, that it was for our Ad|vantage;
for we were well paid for our pains.
We go from one Farm to another, from one
Country-Hou&s;e to another, and almo&s;t upon
every piece of Ground we repeat our Exor|ci&s;ms.
We be&s;peak all the&s;e little In&s;ects, no
otherwi&s;e than if they were Rea&s;onable Crea|tures,
and make u&s;e of the Name of God to
Adjure them.</P>
<P>Adjuro vos per Deum Sanctum, per Deum vi|vum,
per Deum Omnipotentem, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I Adjure you by the Holy God, by the Living
God, by the Almighty God, to depart the&s;e Grounds,
and to get you gone to De&s;ert and Wa&s;te places,
where you may not be in a condition of hurting
any one, nor the Fruits of the Earth.</P>
<P>(If this be not to take the Name of God in
vain, I don't know what is.) Be&s;ides, all
<PB N="87" REF="56">
this was nothing, but meer Labour in Vain;
becau&s;e there was not &s;o much as one poor
Worm or Caterpillar, that offered to budge
from its place for all this puther. When we
were quite tired with Exorci&s;ing, we went to
refre&s;h our &s;elves in the fir&s;t Farm that was
next to us, where the good Country People
did not fail to &s;et before us the be&s;t that they
had. We found &s;ome among&s;t them tho',
that were no Fools; They told us, <HI>Sirs, If we
did not take the pains to rid our Trees of the</HI> Cater|pillars,
<HI>your Exorci&s;ms would &s;tand us in poor
&s;tead.</HI> We reproved them for their want of
Faith, which render'd the pains we took un|profitable
to them. The mo&s;t part of the
Pea&s;ants, by way of acknowledgment for the&s;e
Exorci&s;ms, &s;end all their Fir&s;t-Fruits to the
Prie&s;ts that have Officiated them, &s;o that
we had always the Fir&s;t-Fruit of every Sea|&s;on.</P>
<P>I was once Invited by a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> to
pa&s;s the time of <HI>Vintage</HI> with him in the
Country at his Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, Two Miles
from <HI>Rovigo,</HI> in the <HI>Pole&s;in&eacute;.</HI> When we arrived
there, there were a kind of Flies, which (as
they &s;aid) were fallen from the Sky, and did
much mi&s;chief; they &s;uck'd and devour'd all
the Grapes that were not yet ripe. The Noble
<HI>Venetian</HI> de&s;ired me to accompany the Curate
of the Pari&s;h, in order to Exorci&s;e them;
Accordingly we went thither with five or &s;ix
Clergy-men more. The Heat was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="88" REF="57">
that we were forced to go for &s;helter into every
Hou&s;e we met with in the Fields. Now it
hapned by Mi&s;chance, that he who carried
the Holy-Water, (whether by his having drunk
much, or otherways) fell a&s;leep in a Cellar,
where he was entred to cool him&s;elf. We did
not take notice of his not following us, and
we walk'd almo&s;t a Mile to a certain Field,
where we were to Exorci&s;e. Here we began
to call for our Holy-Water, without which
nothing was to be done; but the Man was not
to be found, and we were oblig'd to &s;end &s;ome
Body to &s;eek for him with all &s;peed. We
&s;taid there near an Hour expecting him, and
during that time the Flies &s;tung us &s;o terribly,
that our Faces and Hands were all of a
Gore-blood; they plainly &s;hew'd by this their
rudene&s;s, that they did not care a Ru&s;h
for our Exorci&s;ms, and accordingly in our
own defence, we di&s;patch'd them as quick,
as po&s;&s;ible, and with all expedition return'd
to our fir&s;t Hou&s;e. The&s;e In&s;ects we found
di&s;charged their fury during the Heat of the
Day; for towards Evening one might &s;afely
walk abroad, without being mole&s;ted by
them. And then it was that we went and re|commenced
our Exorci&s;ms, tho' without the
lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; for the Flies per&s;i&s;ted to make the
&s;ame havock as before, until that a continual
Rain of four or five days kill'd and &s;wept
them all away, better than all the Holy-Water
might have done.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="57">
I went at another time, during my &s;tay at
<HI>Bononia,</HI> to Exorci&s;e the In&s;ects in the Country,
in Company of a Country Curate, who had
a very Comical Wit. He had always a word
ready to make the Company laugh, and all his
Exorci&s;ms were meer Fancies, or perfect
Drolling. He did not tye him&s;elf to the
Ritual, or Form pre&s;crib'd by the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>
Church, but made his Paraphra&s;e upon every
thing; &s;ometimes he &s;poke to the <HI>Pi&s;mires;</HI>
&s;ometimes to the <HI>Gra&s;shoppers;</HI> &s;ometimes he
made his Apo&s;troph's to the <HI>Rats, Lizards,</HI>
and <HI>Worms.</HI> He bani&s;h'd them all one after
another, to the Countries which he a&s;&s;ign'd
them for the place of their Exile, and re|legated
the <HI>Moles</HI> to the Antartick Pole,
without once knowing what it was. He had
&s;carcely pronounc'd the dreadful Sentence, but
a <HI>Mole</HI> came forth out of his Hole; whereupon
the Curate cried out, <HI>Courage, my Friends, look!
there's one of them which is ready to begin his
march.</HI> But the <HI>Mole;</HI> it &s;eems, had no
mind to take &s;o tedious a Journy, and no
&s;ooner had &s;melt the Oar, but crept into
another Hole near to it, in the &s;ame Field.
Then one of the Pea&s;ants that was pre&s;ent,
ran to look into the Hole, to which the <HI>Mole</HI>
had betaken him&s;elf, and &s;aid very innocently,
<HI>What, Sir, is this the Antartick Pole?</HI> We could
not forbear Laughing; and becau&s;e we &s;aw
that this was diametrically oppo&s;ite to that
great Gravity, that mu&s;t more particularly
<PB N="90" REF="58">
be affected upon the&s;e &s;orts of occa&s;ions, we
de&s;ired him to leave off his Drollery; but he
was &s;o habituated to it, that he had much
ado to command him&s;elf. His way of Preach|ing
al&s;o was much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which
made, that tho' he was very ignorant, they
&s;tock'd from all the Villages thereabouts, to
have the diverti&s;ement of hearing him Preach.
I have been pre&s;ent at many other Exorci&s;ms,
and Benedictions of the Fruits of the Earth.
The Prie&s;ts are very willing and ready to
officiate or a&s;&s;i&s;t at them; fora&s;much as it is
an employment both plea&s;ant and profitable
for tho&s;e that di&s;charge it. For by this
means they take the freedom to enter into all
the Country-Hou&s;es of Lords and Gentle|men,
and into their Gardens, where they
never fail of being well Entertain'd. At the
time of Vintage they go and Ble&s;s the Wine
in the Fats; and at <HI>S. Martin,</HI> the Wine in the
Cellars.</P>
<P>I might proceed to relate to you, a great
number of other Benedictions and Exorci&s;ms,
to &s;hew you the Abu&s;e is made thereof by the
Prie&s;ts of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but becau&s;e I
fear keeping you too long upon one and the
&s;ame Subject, I &s;hall chu&s;e rather, to diver&s;ifie
it by &s;ome other Relation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take my Subject from a Remark I
made at the Abby of <HI>Fo&s;&s;a Nova,</HI> whither I
Journyed from <HI>Veletre,</HI> after having &s;een the
<PB N="91" REF="58">
Baptizing of the Bell, which I have already
de&s;cribed. This Abby is not far from <HI>Terra|cine;</HI>
and it was here that <HI>S. Thomas Aquinas</HI>
died, on his Way to the Council of <HI>Lions.</HI>
The Curio&s;ity I had to &s;ee the Place where
he was Buried, made me alight; and the
Monks of that Abby, who are <HI>Bernardines,</HI>
&s;hew'd me a great deal of Civility. They led
me to a Little Chapel under-ground, where
they told me that <HI>S. Thomas</HI> was laid after his
Death. I de&s;ired them to &s;hew me his Re|licks;
but they told me, They could not
an&s;wer my Reque&s;t, becau&s;e his Body had
never been taken up out of the Ground; and
that the Altar of the Chapel was built upon
his Tomb. But for all this fair Story, I knew
very well, that Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the Fifth had be|&s;towed
his Body upon the Religious of S. <HI>Do|minicus,</HI>
who had tran&s;lated it to their Convent
at <HI>Tholou&s;e;</HI> and what I enquir'd concerning
it of the&s;e Monks, was only to di&s;cover their
Hone&s;ty in the ca&s;e. I told them al&s;o, That
I had &s;een a <HI>Capucin</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> who had &s;hewed
me a con&s;iderable piece of S. <HI>Thomas</HI> his Arm,
which he &s;aid, the Fathers of <HI>Fo&s;&s;a Nova</HI> had
be&s;towed upon him. I gave them a de&s;cription
of this <HI>Capucin</HI> from Head to Foot, which
made them at la&s;t call to mind one that was
a <HI>German,</HI> who after he had Fudled him&s;elf
in their Mona&s;tery, had with &s;o much Impor|tunity
reque&s;ted of them &s;ome Relick of
<HI>S. Thomas;</HI> telling them, He was re&s;olved not
<PB N="92" REF="59">
to leave their Mona&s;tery, till they had given
him one; that at length they were fain to
&s;hew him a great heap of Dead-mens Bones,
which was in a Corner of the Chapel, among&s;t
which he had cho&s;en the Relick which he
had &s;hewed me. They told me, That
they them&s;elves que&s;tion'd, whether there
might not be &s;ome Relicks of that Saint
among&s;t all their Bones, becau&s;e the Earth of
the Chapel had been &s;tirred &s;everal times;
and tho' it was preci&s;ely believ'd, that the
Body of <HI>S. Thomas</HI> did re&s;t under the Altar,
yet they were not ab&s;olutely &s;ure of it. This
is the Rea&s;on (&s;aid they) why many Per&s;ons
have made no difficulty to take &s;ome of the&s;e
Bones, in the Conceit, that they might pro|bably
be &s;ome of his; or at lea&s;t in hopes,
that the Pre&s;ence of the Body of the Saint,
near whom they had the Honour to Re&s;t, might
have communicated to them &s;ome Heavenly
Vertue.</P>
<P>To &s;peak the truth, the&s;e are the very Rea|&s;onings,
which the Gentlemen of <HI>Rome;</HI> I
mean the Pope and Cardinals, make u&s;e of
every day, with reference to the Holy Bodies,
which they fetch out of the <HI>Catacombes,</HI>
and which they &s;end &s;o boldly, and &s;o fre|quently
to places of their Communion, to be
Wor&s;hiped there. The&s;e <HI>Catacombes,</HI> in the
Sen&s;e they take them in, are Subterranean
Places, where Believers a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves
in the times of Per&s;ecution; and where they
<PB N="93" REF="59">
Buried the Corps of their Martyrs; but they
al&s;o indifferently Buried there the Bodies of all
Chri&s;tians, &s;o that as the&s;e places &s;erved them
for Temples, or places to meet in, &s;o they
&s;erved them al&s;o for Church-yards to bury
their Dead. The Popes having in the&s;e la&s;t
Ages, taken into mature Con&s;ideration, the
great gain they reaped from the Bones of their
Saints, had recour&s;e to the&s;e places, as to in|exhau&s;tible
Mines, and indifferently &s;eized all
the Bones they met with there: Yea, their
Avarice la&s;ht out to that degree, that either
not knowing, or not being able to di&s;tingui&s;h
the true <HI>Catacombes,</HI> they have gone to &s;earch
for dead Bodies in the Common Sewers, or
Subterranean Vaults, which were the Sinks to
carry off the filth of the City, and where in
ancient times they were u&s;ed to fling the Bo|dies
of Malefactors, after their Execution.
True it is, that among&s;t them, were &s;ome|times
found the Bodies of Martyrs, which e&s;|caped
the knowledge of Chri&s;tians. The
Popes not having the power to di&s;tingui&s;h the
one from the other, and to &s;pare them&s;elves
a trouble, which be&s;ides would have been pure
labour lo&s;t, by the Power of God him&s;elf,
which they profe&s;s them&s;elves to have, meta|morphos'd
them all, <HI>dictum factum,</HI> into Saints.
The Heathens had al&s;o Caves and Vaults,
where they cau&s;ed them&s;elves to be Interr'd
with their whole Families; and the greate&s;t
part of all the&s;e Bones, are now upon the Al|tars
<PB N="94" REF="60">
of the Papi&s;ts, under the name of Saints,
taken up out of the <HI>Catacombes.</HI> And fora&s;|much
as the Popes are ignorant of their
Names, they baptize them anew, and give
them a Name as be&s;t plea&s;eth them, which is
the cau&s;e, why there be found &s;o many Saints
of the &s;ame Name. This is al&s;o the true cau&s;e
of &s;o many Conte&s;ts and Trials between the
Prie&s;ts and the Monks, who all pretend in
good time, to be the &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the
Primitive Saint, of this or the other Name.
The&s;e Trials are to be determined at <HI>Rome,</HI>
by means of Mony, which &s;till inflames the
Popes with a greater Zeal, to &s;end as many as
they can of the&s;e Saints into all parts, which
one day or other will not fail to furni&s;h them
with matter for Trials &s;o gainful to them; yea,
we may affirm that there be almo&s;t as many
Trials at <HI>Rome,</HI> about Relicks, as about Bene|ficial
matters. Now the Doctrin which &s;erves
to quiet the Con&s;ciences of the Romani&s;ts,
from the checks that might torment them, for
having expo&s;ed, and &s;till daily expo&s;ing &s;uch
abominable Filthine&s;&s;es upon their Altars, is
this, that they believe, that what S. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith,
that the unbelieving Wife, is &s;anctified by the
believing Husband, ought al&s;o to be under|&s;tood
of their Relicks; fora&s;much as all the
Bones, which are found in one Vault, are &s;an|ctified
by their Neighbourhood with tho&s;e of
one Saint. Or at lea&s;t, if this won't do,
they betake them&s;elves to their la&s;t &s;hift, which
<PB N="95" REF="60">
is this, That a good intention is an abundant
excu&s;e for all the&s;e petty irregularities in tho&s;e,
who continue in the bo&s;om of the Church of
<HI>Rome;</HI> &s;o that it is enough according to them,
to have a right intention of honouring &s;uch a
Saint, or &s;he Saint, and to receive with Re|verence
and Obedience the In&s;truments pro|po&s;ed
to them, for to honour them. They
have propounded &s;uch like Arguments to the
Prote&s;tants of <HI>France,</HI> to per&s;uade them to go
to Ma&s;s. Why do you fear, &s;ay they, to a|dore
the Ho&s;t, as long as you direct your in|tention
to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who in it is wor&s;hiped?
For by this means it will be Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom
you &s;hall adore, and not the Bread, &s;uppo&s;ing
it to be &s;o: Only be obedient to the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and your good intention &s;hall &s;ave
you. And they have di&s;cour&s;ed them at the
&s;ame rate about Relicks.</P>
<P>Now the u&s;e, that the Prie&s;ts and Monks of
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> do make of the&s;e Prin|ciples,
is this, that there are no Bones what&s;oe|ver,
no not the Bones of an A&s;s or Hor&s;e,
but they may make Relicks of them; they
need only break a piece of them and tell you,
that it is a Relick of one of the Eleven thou|&s;and
Virgins that &s;uffered Martyrdom at <HI>Col|len,</HI>
or el&s;e one of the Soldiers of the <HI>Theban</HI>
Legion, who were all cut in pieces at the
pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Alpes,</HI> for refu&s;ing to Sacrifice
to <HI>Mars</HI> the Traveller. They may &s;hew you
the Rib of a &s;ucking Pig, and tell you it is a
<PB N="96" REF="61">
Relick of one of the little Innocents, who
were Ma&s;&s;acred at our Saviours Birth; or
La&s;tly, tell you that it is the bone of a Saint
taken out of the <HI>Catacombes.</HI> Be&s;ides all the&s;e,
they can give you many other Categories, un|der
which their Relicks are commonly ranked
and Mar&s;hal'd; and pray how can you con|tradict
them, as to what they alledge? And as
for them, Good-men, they &s;alve their Con|&s;ciences,
by the intention they have, of pro|curing
Honour to &s;uch a he or &s;he Saint, for
whom they have the greate&s;t Devotion, or
who &s;uits be&s;t with their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I was once in the Abby of the Trinity at
<HI>Vandome</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> when they expo&s;ed their
Trea&s;ury of Relicks: They &s;hewed us among&s;t
other things a Jaw-bone, which the Monks
told us was that of S. <HI>Magdalen;</HI> and a very
able Phy&s;ician, who was pre&s;ent at the &s;ame
time, was ready to maintain to their Faces,
and would forfeit his Head, if he did not
prove to them, by the Texture, &s;caling and
largene&s;s of the Bone, that it never belong'd
to a human Body, but it was the piece of the
Jaw-bone of &s;ome Bea&s;t or other. But the Fa|thers
were &s;o far from de&s;iring him to di&s;a|bu&s;e
them in the ca&s;e, that they pre&s;ently
pop'd up another Relick, to put him by his
di&s;plea&s;ing Di&s;cour&s;e. This Relick was that
they call the <HI>Holy Tear,</HI> which is &s;o famous
in that Country. The Tradition they pre|tend
to have concerning it runs thus, that
<PB N="97" REF="61">
when our Saviour wept over <HI>Lazarus,</HI> an An|gel
gathered up his Tears, in a &s;mall Cry&s;tal
Vial, and that having pre&s;erved them a long
time, he gave them to S. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> who
was then doing Penance, at a place which is
called <HI>la Sainte Baume,</HI> near to <HI>Mar&s;eilles;</HI>
that in proce&s;s of time, this Relick was carri|ed
to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where it continued du|ring
the Reign of the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperour; and
being afterwards fallen, together with all the
Riches of that great City, into the hands of
the <HI>Turks,</HI> a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperour pre&s;ented it
to <HI>Godfrey</HI> Earl of <HI>Vandome,</HI> who depo&s;ed it
in this Abby. It &s;eems by this Tradition that
it took many turns, before it came thither,
and above all, that which I con&s;ider is, that
it hath pa&s;t through the hands of Infidels and
Enemies to the Name of Chri&s;t. But for
all this, the Roman Catholicks, and above all,
the Monks of that Abby, have not the lea&s;t
doubt or &s;cruple concerning it; but be&s;tow
upon it the Wor&s;hip of <HI>Latria,</HI> even the &s;ame
they give to Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf. Upon any
extraordinary occa&s;ion of great Drought, or
raging Sickne&s;s, they carry it &s;olemnly through
the City, and that with greater Pomp than
they do their Holy Sacrament. The&s;e Fathers,
who are Reformed <HI>Benedictins,</HI> told us, That
now for &s;o many Hundred years, that is to
&s;ay, &s;ince the time of our Saviour, the &s;aid
Tear had been pre&s;erved &s;o fre&s;h, as a Tear
that actually drops from the Eye. We viewed
<PB N="98" REF="62">
this Cry&s;tal very attentively holding it up a|gain&s;t
the Light, and afterwards took a re|view
of it at the Light of a Wax-Taper, but
we could di&s;cover nothing of what they were
plea&s;ed to tell us. They have recour&s;e to this
Relick in all Maladies of the Eyes, and upon
this account, it brings a va&s;t Income to the&s;e
Fathers. Surely People had need to be En|dowed
with a great Stock of Simplicity and
good Intention to adore things, which even
according to humane Tradition are &s;o uncer|tain
and doubtful.</P>
<P>We meet with a Story in the Life of S. <HI>Mar|tin,</HI>
which makes it appear, that this good In|tention,
was not &s;o generally in vogue in his
time, or at lea&s;t that the Bi&s;hops did not fa|vour
it, at the rate as tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Com|munion
do at pre&s;ent. There was a Devotion
got up at &s;ome Leagues from <HI>Tours,</HI> towards
certain Relicks, which made a great Noi&s;e.
The People ran from all parts thither out of
Dovotion, and they pretended that great Mi|racles
were wrought upon the Place, and all
manner of Maladies healed. S. <HI>Martin</HI> (as
&s;aith the Hi&s;tory of his Life, writ by <HI>Ribade|neira</HI>
the Je&s;uit,) went him&s;elf thither by way
of Devotion; and being at the Place, he was
&s;eized as it were with a &s;ecret In&s;tinct, or
Divine In&s;piration, that the Bones which they
Wor&s;hiped in that Place, were not the Bones
of Saints. S. <HI>Martin</HI> to be cleared in the Mat|ter,
adjur'd the Bones to tell him, who&s;e they
<PB N="99" REF="62">
were; whereupon (adds the Story) was heard a
terrible Voice proceeding from the Shrine or
Ca&s;e wherein the Bones lay; which &s;aid, <HI>We
are &s;o far from being the Bones of Saints, that we
are the Bones of two mi&s;erable Criminals, Mur|therers
and Robbers on the High-way, who were
executed at &s;uch a time publickly for our Crimes;
and yet of a long time have we been here wor|&s;hiped
as if we had been Gods.</HI> S. <HI>Martin</HI> having
received this Information, immediately com|manded
the Bones to be ca&s;t out upon the
Lay-&s;tall.</P>
<P>Good, GOD! If all the fal&s;e Relicks, which
at pre&s;ent are ador'd in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
had Voices, and could but &s;peak, as the&s;e did,
what &s;trange Stories &s;hould we hear! Some
would &s;ay, We are the Bones of Heathens, or of
Malefactors; others, of Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, Dogs, &amp;c.
And yet I que&s;tion very much, whether after
all this, they would re&s;olve to quit them.
They would &s;ay, <HI>It's like that the&s;e Voices were
only the Illu&s;ions and Artifices of the Devil, who
is envious at the Glory that is be&s;towed on the
Saints; and that their Church being Infallible,
having propos'd the&s;e Relicks to Believers to be
wor&s;hiped, She can neither err in matter of Right,
or in Matter of Fact.</HI> See here a true Por|traicture
of the Spirit of that Church, as it is
at pre&s;ent; being &s;o far changed, I will not &s;ay
from that of the Primitive times, but even
from that of the middle Ages, as nothing
more.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="63">
But we are to take notice of a di&s;tinction
here, which is this, That if any Relick &s;hould
chance to be introduc'd by any other way,
but that of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and come to
the knowledge of the Popes, they would never
&s;uffer it. Father <HI>Mabillon</HI> gives us an In&s;tance
of it in his Voyage of <HI>Italy;</HI> for he tells us,
That &s;ome <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Addre&s;t them|&s;elves
to Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the Eighth, to obtain
Indulgences upon the account of a Saint called
S. <HI>Viar;</HI> the Pope being &s;urpriz'd at the No|velty
and &s;ingularity of the Name, would be
informed upon what good ground the Holine&s;s
of this Saint was founded, to whom &s;uch
extraordinary Qualities were attributed in
&s;ome places: For confirmation of all, they
brought him an In&s;cription containing the&s;e
Letters S. <HI>VIAR.</HI> But the Skilful and Learned
found, that the In&s;cription was made for a
<HI>Praefectus Viarum;</HI> that is, a Per&s;on who had
the care and in&s;pection of the High-Ways
among&s;t the <HI>Romans.</HI> Wherefore the Pope
forbad them any more to expo&s;e this their
Saint; whereas indeed could they have made
out, that this Relick had been be&s;towed upon
them by one of the Popes, his Predece&s;&s;ors,
the ca&s;e would have been alter'd; and we
have all the rea&s;on in the World to believe,
that to maintain the Honour of the Holy See,
he would never have &s;uppre&s;t it as he did.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="63">
The <HI>Capucin</HI> whom I had &s;een at <HI>Rome,</HI>
that had got a Bone of S. <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> at
<HI>Fo&s;&s;a Nova,</HI> had already broken it into a thou|&s;and
little bits, which he had wrapt up in
pieces of Paper, with a de&s;ign of di&s;tributing
them in his Journy, when he &s;hould return to
his own Country. The <HI>Capucins,</HI> and others
who are called <HI>Mendicants,</HI> never carry any
Mony about them, and con&s;equently pay no|thing
where&s;oever they come; but being
look'd upon as men full fraught with Relicks
and <HI>Agnus Dei's,</HI> the Per&s;ons who entertain
them, ask &s;ome of the&s;e to be be&s;towed upon
them; or rather, they them&s;elves prevent
them, by giving them &s;ome of the&s;e Pre&s;ents
before they &s;et any thing before them, as being
a&s;&s;ured, that by this means they &s;hall procure
better Treatment from their Ho&s;ts.</P>
<P>I have on a thou&s;and Occa&s;ions, in the
Company of <HI>Capucins,</HI> &s;een them di&s;tribute a
thou&s;and Relicks; but among&s;t the re&s;t, I
was once in the <HI>Alpes,</HI> in a Village called
S. <HI>Gothard,</HI> at the foot of a very high and
famous Mountain, which bears the Name of
it. I arrived there at Dinner time, and being
got into an Inn, I perceived two Fathers
<HI>Capucins,</HI> who were warming them&s;elves at a
great Fire, in the be&s;t Chamber of the Hou&s;e,
whil&s;t their Dinner was making ready. The
de&s;ire I had to meet with Company, made me
entreat my Ho&s;te&s;s to endeavour to per&s;uade
them, to let me Dine with them: They very
<PB N="102" REF="64">
obligingly con&s;ented to my Reque&s;t; and I
&s;aw that one of the Fathers took the Ho&s;te&s;s
a&s;ide to a Corner of the Room, and gave her
a Paper very neatly folded up. I could not at
that time imagin what it might be; and &s;oon
after Dinner was brought up. After we had
Dined, the <HI>Capucins</HI> call'd up their Ho&s;te&s;s,
and ask'd her what they had to pay? <HI>Truly</HI>
(&s;aid the Woman) <HI>as for your part good Fathers,
your Reckoning is ea&s;ily made; but for this Gentle|man
here, there is a Crown to pay for his part.</HI>
I found my &s;hare to be overreckon'd, and
that the Ho&s;te&s;s had a mind to make up the
Expence of her Charity towards the&s;e good
Fathers out of my Pur&s;e. In the mean time
one of the <HI>Capucins</HI> told her very plea&s;antly,
that they did not intend to quit her at &s;o
Cheap a Rate, &s;eeing they had be&s;towed upon
her the mo&s;t precious Piece in all their Trea|&s;ury;
but that &s;uch a Day, the next Week,
they were to pa&s;s by that way again, and
that they hoped &s;he would well weigh and
con&s;ider the great worth of the Pre&s;ent they
had be&s;towed upon her: Which was as much
as to &s;ay, That they expected to be once more
plentifully Treated by her, and that accord|ingly
&s;he would think of providing &s;ome good
thing for them again&s;t that Day. They began
afterwards, as if they had a mind to in&s;ult
over me, for that it had co&s;t me &s;o much,
tho' I far'd no better than they, and that as
for them a &s;mall Devotional Pre&s;ent had dou|bly
<PB N="103" REF="64">
&s;atisfied their Ho&s;te&s;s, without paying any
thing. I demanded of them, what kind of
Pre&s;ent it was? They told me it was a Relick,
but would not &s;pecifie it particularly. This
put me upon making a pretext to go down,
to know of the Ho&s;te&s;s what it might be.
As &s;oon as I came down, I &s;ound her very
devoutly pre&s;enting the Relick to her Dome|&s;ticks
in the Kitchin, for them to ki&s;s it. It
was a Tooth for&s;ooth of an old <HI>Box-Comb;</HI> &s;he
&s;hewed it me, with the Paper in which it was
wrapt, whereon was writ with great Letters,
<HI>A Holy Tooth of the Comb, wherewith S.</HI> Martha
<HI>Combed her Head at</HI> Mar&s;eilles. I viewed it
very attentively, and as I was going to wipe
off with the end of my Handkerchief, &s;ome
filth that was upon it, that I might with the
le&s;s aver&s;ion ki&s;s it; not that I believ'd the
Relick, but to the end I might not give any
offence to others (for at that time I was a
good <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick) the Ho&s;te&s;s would not
let me, and in a kind of Pa&s;&s;ion told me, That
I was going about to take away the be&s;t part
of the Relick, which was the Sweat of
the Saint. I re&s;tor'd the gay Relick to my
Ho&s;te&s;s, and return'd to my <HI>Capucins.</HI> I told
them, I came from having taken a view of
the Holy Tooth of the Comb of S. <HI>Martha,</HI>
wherewith they had pre&s;ented the Woman of
the Hou&s;e, as a Recompence for her Treating
of them. I ea&s;ily perceiv'd, that this Com|plement
did not plea&s;e them at all; for having
<PB N="104" REF="65">
entreated them to tell me, how they came to
light upon &s;o precious a Trea&s;ure; they An|&s;wer'd
very fiercly, That it was not their
bu&s;ine&s;s to give me an account of it. Where|upon
I al&s;o left them, without u&s;ing much
Ceremony, in order to pro&s;ecute my Jour|ny.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Roman Catholicks, cannot
endure to hear, that they be&s;tow their Ado|rations
upon things that are &s;o very vile and
contemptible; but it is only by rea&s;on of their
Ignorance of what pa&s;&s;eth in tho&s;e Countries
where Popery is rampant; for there may be
&s;een things yet far more ridiculous, &s;uch as the
Lanthorn of <HI>Judas;</HI> the Dice wherewith the
Souldiers Ca&s;t Lots, which of them &s;hould
have Chri&s;t's Garment; a Shoe of St. <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI>
Hair, Paring of Nails, and all manner of Ex|crements
of their Saints and Sainte&s;&s;es. The
Trea&s;uries of their Churches are top fill'd with
the&s;e kind of precious Pelicks, and the Pro|te&s;tant
Travellers, may make them&s;elves very
merry in <HI>Italy,</HI> if they will give them&s;elves the
lei&s;ure to go and &s;ee the Trea&s;ures which are
kept in their Churches, and more e&s;pecially in
the Country, where the <HI>Cupucins,</HI> and other
<HI>Mendicants,</HI> take care to leave great &s;tore of
them. At lea&s;t they may be &s;ure to find there,
tho&s;e Implements the Papi&s;ts call <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI>
and almo&s;t in every Pari&s;h, one of S. <HI>Margarets</HI>
Girdles. Their <HI>Agnus Dei</HI>'s are pieces of white
Wax, upon which is imprinted the Figure of a
<PB N="105" REF="65">
little Lamb, carrying a Cro&s;s upon his Shoul|der.
The Popes ble&s;s them in the Holy-Week
at <HI>Rome</HI> with abundance of Ceremony, in
memory of the words which S. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI>
&s;aid of our Saviour, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God
which takes away the Sins of the World.</HI> They
believe therefore, conformably to this, that
the&s;e <HI>Agnus Dei's</HI> do forgive Sins; at lea&s;t, tho&s;e
that are not very heinous ones indeed; and they
almo&s;t pay as great re&s;pect to them, as they do
to the Ho&s;t it &s;elf: They carry them in Proce&s;|&s;ion,
they kneel before them, they pray to them;
Secular per&s;ons may not touch them with their
Fingers, they mu&s;t be Prie&s;ts, or Monks, or Nuns,
to whom the Bi&s;hops give this permi&s;&s;ion and
priviledge. The Nuns make it a great part of
their employment to make Enclo&s;ures of Silk
for them, very neatly wrought with a Needle
into all manner of Figures, and then they
be&s;tow them upon &s;uch Seculars as Pre&s;ent
them highe&s;t, for the Sanctification of their
Souls. And be&s;ides the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, they
are over and above very good to pre&s;erve a
Roman Catholick from all the evil Accidents
of this Life.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Girdle of <HI>S. Mar|garet,</HI>
we are to know, that according to the
Tradition of the Papi&s;ts, a great Dragon
having offer'd to devour this Saint, &s;he whipt
off her Girdle, and having put it about his
Body, he immediately became as gentle as a
Lamb, and did her no hurt at all. The Prie&s;ts
<PB N="106" REF="66">
of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hereupon believ'd,
That this Girdle which had tam'd the Dragon,
which they pretend was the Devil him&s;elf,
might as well be of efficacy to tame Women,
or rather the Pains they endure in Child-Bed.
Wherefore almo&s;t all of them have pieces of
it in their Churches, and &s;ome of them pre|tend
to have the whole Girdle. In&s;omuch,
that if all the parts of it were joyn'd together,
they would without doubt make a Girdle that
would reach the length of the <HI>Strand,</HI> or of
<HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> in the City of <HI>London.</HI> They are the
Prie&s;ts and Monks them&s;elves that carry it to
Women Great with Child: 'Tis they them|&s;elves
put it about their Bodies, repeating cer|tain
Supplications and Prayers; and whil&s;t they
are performing this Function, all the Company
mu&s;t withdraw out of the Room. If the
Woman chance to be Delivered before the
Girdle comes, there's no hurt done, for her
Deliverance in this ca&s;e is attributed to the
Vow &s;he has made to the Girdle; but if &s;he
happens to die, then it is, becau&s;e &s;he was too
backward and negligent in &s;ending for it;
and if it happens as &s;ometimes it does, that &s;he
dies between the Hands of the Prie&s;ts, having
the Girdle actually about her; in this ca&s;e the
Prie&s;ts very devoutly &s;neak away with their
Girdle, and lay it up again in their Chapel,
without &s;aying any thing but this, that there
is no obviating the orders and cour&s;e of Provi|dence.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="66">
The Prie&s;ts have brought things to that pa&s;s
in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that nothing can be
done without them; they mu&s;t be pre&s;ent
every where with their Relicks, their Holy
Oils, and their Holy Water. Their Benedi|ction
of the Marriage-Bed, is a Ceremony
that de&s;erves our &s;peaking a word or two of
it. The Prie&s;ts go in the Evening to Ble&s;s the
Bed of the Married Couple, before they Bed
together, in the &s;ame manner as God ble&s;&s;ed
all Living Creatures, after their Creation, giving
them the virtue of <HI>Increa&s;ing and Multiplying.</HI>
After that they have be&s;towed their Holy
Water, they have good Wine pre&s;ented them
to drink, and they help to put the Bridegroom
and Bride to Bed. What think you, Sir; Are
not the&s;e very mode&s;t and becoming Occupa|tions
for Men that profe&s;s Cha&s;tity?</P>
<P>I have made mention of all the&s;e Benedi|ctions,
upon occa&s;ion of that of the Eggs at
<HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> which &s;ome Ignorant Papi&s;ts, and little
vers'd in their Ceremonies had denied; and
if any &s;hould be found to deny any of the&s;e
here mentioned, we are ready to &s;hew 'em
them in the <HI>Roman Ritual.</HI> I have al&s;o made
mention of &s;ome Relicks upon occa&s;ion of
that of <HI>S. Thomas Aquinas,</HI> which the Monks of
<HI>Fo&s;&s;a Nova</HI> pretend to have in their Abby.
I &s;hall now continue my Journy towards <HI>Ter|racinne,</HI>
where I arrived very late; and part|ing
thence again betimes in the Morning, I
had no lei&s;ure to examine any thing there
<PB N="108" REF="67">
about Religious Matters. Only they gave me
a &s;ad Relation in my Inn, of a terrible De&s;o|lation
cau&s;ed by a furious Tempe&s;t about five
Days before, all along the Sea-Coa&s;t from
<HI>Terracinne</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> in which 14 Ships had
been da&s;h'd again&s;t the Rocks, or Shipwreck'd
on the Sands in &s;everal places. I had heard
them &s;peak of it at <HI>Rome</HI> Three days before I
came away from thence, but was not then
inform'd of all the Particulars of it. The
only thing I took notice of in the Account
they gave me, &s;uiting to my pre&s;ent Subject,
was, that among&s;t the re&s;t there was one
Ve&s;&s;el lo&s;t, which had been but lately Ble&s;&s;ed,
in order to make it Tempe&s;t-proof. They
told me al&s;o, That there was a Prie&s;t in that
&s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, who was put into the Inqui&s;ition
for having burnt his Crucifix, after that it had
happily been the In&s;trument of &s;aving his life.
This Prie&s;t had a de&s;ign of Travelling into
Foreign Countries, and had lighted upon a
very good Invention for to &s;ave his Life, in
ca&s;e of Danger. He had cau&s;ed to be made for
him a great Cro&s;s of Wood, which was hollow
within, but joyn'd very light and clo&s;e on
all &s;ide, like unto tho&s;e the Penitents carry
upon their Shoulders in the Holy Week; and
differ'd only in this, that it had the Image of
our Saviour fa&s;tned to it. This Cro&s;s was thus
contriv'd by him, that it might be a proper
means for him, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be Ca&s;t-away
at Sea, to e&s;cape upon it; and indeed, both
<PB N="109" REF="67">
the Shipwreck and his E&s;cape, by means of the
Cro&s;s, hapned according to the fore&s;ight he
&s;eem'd to have had of it. There aro&s;e a
violent Tempe&s;t, the fir&s;t Night the Ve&s;&s;el
put to Sea; &s;o that after having been ex|treamly
to&s;t and beaten by the Waves, it
&s;prung a Leak, and let in Water on every
&s;ide. All tho&s;e that were in her, peri&s;hed,
except only &s;ome Sea-men, and our Prie&s;t,
who after that he had made u&s;e of his great
Crucifix, to exhort tho&s;e who were ready to
be drowned, to die well, committed him&s;elf
to the Sea with it, and by this means was
driven by the Waves to the Shoar; being thus
e&s;caped, he had courage enough to take his
Cro&s;s out of the Water along with him; and
&s;oon after met with the Sea-men, that had
&s;av'd them&s;elves al&s;o, who had made a great
Fire on the Shoar to dry them&s;elves, and pa&s;s
the re&s;t of the Night, into which the Prie&s;t
ca&s;t his great Crucifix, and would not &s;uffer
the Company to &s;ave it from burning; but the
poor Sea-men, who were not accu&s;tomed with
&s;uch Sights, were &s;truck with Horror; they
&s;eized the Prie&s;t, they manacled him, and
drag'd him the next Morning to the Inqui&s;i|tion;
and from &s;o black a Crime, as this
Action of his &s;eem'd to be, inferr'd, That he
was a Sorcerer, and had rai&s;ed the Tempe&s;t.
Neverthele&s;s, I was told, That he defended
him&s;elf very well; and that in all likelyhood
the Inqui&s;ition would relea&s;e him, becau&s;e
<PB N="110" REF="68">
he pleaded, That what he had done, was in
conformity to the Practice of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> with re&s;pect to Holy things, that are in
danger of being profaned, which is to burn
them: In like manner he alledg'd, That not
knowing how to di&s;po&s;e of his great Crucifix,
and being afraid le&s;t it might be profaned,
he had imitated the Cu&s;tom of the Church in
this Point.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of many &s;ad Acci|dents,
which daily happen to the Holy things
of Papi&s;ts, and e&s;pecially to that which is the
chiefe&s;t Object of their Devotions, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Holy Ho&s;t, or their Sacrament. I take it for a
thing that is &s;ure and certain, that there are
very few days in a year, when in &s;ome part
of the World or other, they are not fain to
burn it, or to put it into a filthy &s;tinking Hole,
to which notwith&s;tanding they give the fair
Title of a <HI>Sacrarium,</HI> or Sanctuary, which is
(as it were) the Dunghil, where they ca&s;t forth
that which they believe to be the true Body
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that the &s;ame may there return
to Corruption. I my &s;elf have found, upon
two &s;everal Occa&s;ions, the Ho&s;ts which are
kept in the <HI>Ciboire,</HI> in very bad order: The fir&s;t
was near <HI>Orvieto,</HI> in a Country Pari&s;h, where
the <HI>Ciboire</HI> being not clo&s;e &s;hut, and the Taber|nacle
or Cupboard of the <HI>Sacrarium</HI> not being
clo&s;e joyned, the <HI>Pi&s;mires</HI> had made bold to
vi&s;it the Holy Sacrament, and finding the
Ho&s;ts to their Tooth, had eaten &s;ome part of
<PB N="111" REF="68">
them, and were dragging the re&s;t in little
pieces to their Ant-hills. I acquainted the
Curate (after I had &s;aid Ma&s;s) with this di&s;|order,
who was much troubled at it; for it
was occa&s;ion'd by his Negligence, who had
forgot to &s;hut the <HI>Ciborium.</HI> He entreated me
more earne&s;tly, than he would have done God,
not to &s;peak a word of it to any Body; be|cau&s;e,
if it &s;hould come to the Ears of the
Grand Vicar of <HI>Orvietto,</HI> who was already his
Enemy, he would have been undone. We
therefore both of us endeavoured to remedy it
as well as po&s;&s;ibly we could; and indeed the
Bi&s;hop him&s;elf, had he been there, could have
done no more than we did. To prevent all
manner of Scandal, we &s;taid till all the People
were gone out of Church, and traced the
<HI>Pi&s;mires</HI> to their Hole, which went under|ground;
and pur&s;uing it, we found it to lead
to a Co&s;&s;in, wherein there was a Body that
was half Rotten, which ca&s;t forth a mo&s;t
dreadful &s;tink and infection. Fora&s;much
therefore, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;earch
any further, we filled the Hole of the <HI>Ants</HI>
with Straw and Wood, and &s;et fire to it, in
order to con&s;ume the Ho&s;t, the <HI>Ants,</HI> and all
that was in it; and there is no doubt but this
&s;ucceeded according to our de&s;ire. We met
with many of the&s;e little Animals, who being
laden with their Sacrilegious Prey, ran up and
down the Church, which we pick'd up, and
burnt them in a Cha&s;ing-Di&s;h, as many as
<PB N="112" REF="69">
we could meet with, and after that we had
well Swept the Church, we ca&s;t all the Sweep|ings
into the Fire, and con&s;umed them. This
was indeed as much as could be done. But
alas! there were &s;everal other things, which
it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to remedy; for &s;eeing
that in all probability the <HI>Ants</HI> had been long
a labouring at the tran&s;porting of the&s;e Ho&s;ts,
the Country People, who all this while came to
Ma&s;s, had without doubt cru&s;hed many of them
with their Feet, and had carried away with them
pieces of the Ho&s;t, &s;ticking to the dirt of their
Shoes: Yea, we our &s;elves, who had taken &s;o
great pains to remedy this Mi&s;chance, when
we viewed the Soles of our Shoes, found
&s;everal Particles &s;ticking to them. Now, ac|cording
to the Doctrin of the Papi&s;ts, the Body
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is whole and entire in the lea&s;t
Particle, as well as in the greate&s;t, and con&s;e|quently
we may imagin, how great this Profa|nation
was.</P>
<P>I have read &s;omething of a Book Printed
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and made by a <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> where treat|ing
of the Euchari&s;t, he takes upon him to
confound the Prote&s;tants, by the Examples
he alledgeth of Bea&s;ts, who have paid their
Adorations to the Sacrament. Among&s;t other
things we read there, That <HI>Ants</HI> and <HI>Bees,</HI>
having by chance met with Con&s;ecrated Ho&s;ts,
which &s;ome Hereticks had thrown away in the
Fields, they had with a great deal of Reve|rence
gathered them up, and carried them to
<PB N="113" REF="69">
their Hills and Hives, and having divided
them&s;elves into Quires, they by turns chanted
mu&s;ically, and &s;ang forth the Prai&s;es of God,
until the Prie&s;ts being drawn that way by their
melodious harmony, came and fetch'd away
their Ho&s;ts. What Experiences of this kind
the good Father Je&s;uit may have had, I know
not; but for the good Curate and my &s;elf, I
am &s;ure we met with no Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>The &s;econd place where I found the Con|&s;ecrated
Ho&s;ts much abu&s;ed, was in a Little
Church near to <HI>Ancona,</HI> in a very moi&s;t place.
I found the <HI>Ciborium</HI> full of Wafers; tho&s;e
that lay uppermo&s;t &s;tuck to one another, and
tho&s;e at the bottom were turn'd into a kind
of Glue or Jelly: And fora&s;much as it was
evident, that &s;ome of them were wholly &s;poiled,
and the re&s;t in a fair way to be &s;o too, after
that Ma&s;s was ended I ca&s;t them all into the
<HI>Sacrarium,</HI> which is a Hole made in the Wall
expre&s;s for this purpo&s;e, and poured upon them
great quantity of Holy-Water, to make them
&s;ink to the bottom, and to clean&s;e the Orifice
of the <HI>Sacrarium.</HI> This was at that time all
the Ceremony I u&s;ed to bury that, which I
then believed to be the Body of our Lord.
Others have found the Ho&s;ts full of Worms;
and in other places, the Rats have eat them up
whole.</P>
<P><HI>The Divines at</HI> Rome <HI>admit, for the mo&s;t
part, as many Miracles in the&s;e kind of Cor|ruptions,
as they do in Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation:</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="70">
For after the &s;ame manner <HI>(&s;ay they)</HI> as at the
Con&s;ecration, the Sub&s;tance of the Bread is tran|&s;ub&s;tantiated
into that of the Body, and that the
Accidents of Bread and Wine are &s;upported by the
Divine Power without a Subject; &s;o in the next
moment to Corruption <HI>(&s;ay they)</HI> the Body and
Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t cea&s;e to be in the Ho&s;t, and
in the Chalice; and that God, by his Omnipotence,
creates in it another Sub&s;tance, which becomes the
Subject of Corruption.</P>
<P>I have been an Eye-witne&s;s of many other
con&s;iderable Accidents that have hapned to
their Holy Sacrament. It frequently comes to
pa&s;s, that Prie&s;ts (whil&s;t they are &s;aying Ma&s;s)
let &s;ome of the Con&s;ecrated Wafers fall down
to the ground, and tread upon them without
thinking of it. Others &s;pill the Con&s;ecrated
Cup upon the Altar; &s;o that the Precious Blood
of our Lord runs down on all &s;ides, and is
&s;pilt upon the Ground, among&s;t the Filth and
Spittings of the People. Sometimes Prie&s;ts
have been taken with a Vomiting, immediately
after Communion. A Prie&s;t at <HI>Venice,</HI> as he
was lifting up the <HI>Calice,</HI> for the People to
wor&s;hip it, &s;pilt it all upon his Head and Sacer|dotal
Habit, which was all &s;tain'd with it.
The&s;e are &s;ome of tho&s;e great Accidents that
happen to the Papi&s;ts, with re&s;pect to their
Sacrament, and which put them to extream
trouble and concern for the remedying of
them. The be&s;t way they have, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">is to wipe it
up with Tow and Linnen Cloths, which are
<PB N="115" REF="70">
afterwards ca&s;t into the Fire and burnt, to
wa&s;h the Ve&s;tments into which it is &s;oaked in
&s;even &s;everal Waters, and to &s;crape the Stones
and the Wood upon which any of it is fallen;
there be &s;ome Prie&s;ts, who out of Devotion
lick them fir&s;t of all, clean with their Tongues.
True it is, that, according to the Faith of the
Papi&s;ts, if it is the true Body and Blood of
our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they cannot be too
careful in endeavouring to gather up &s;o great
a Trea&s;ure; but in good earne&s;t, can any Man
believe, that it is con&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom
of God, to have plac'd the Body and Blood
of his Son, under tho&s;e accidents that are &s;ub|ject
to a thou&s;and Ca&s;ualties and Profanati|ons,
and this after his having glorified it in
Heaven, and &s;eated it at his right Hand? They
&s;hew us a frightful thing in <HI>Germany,</HI> at a place
called <HI>Maladurne,</HI> which is a Corporal, or a
kind of Tablecloth of Arras, whereupon the
Ho&s;t and Calice are placed, when Ma&s;s is
&s;aid, upon which there is Imprinted the Fi|gure
as it were of the body of a Tree, divi|ded
into Seven or Nine Branches; at the end
of each Bow, is a Head like to tho&s;e, they
make of our Saviour Crowned with Thorns,
upon the Napkin or Handkerchif of <HI>Veronica:</HI>
The whole is very ill Drawn, and all the
&s;troaks and Lineaments of the Heads are very
bungling, neither are all the Heads equally
great, or proportionable to one another. But
for all that, the Tradition is, that the Curate
<PB N="116" REF="71">
of that place, as he was one day Celebrating
Ma&s;s, &s;pilt the Con&s;ecrated Calice, and that
the Ble&s;&s;ed Blood of our Saviour falling upon
the Corporal, did Form all the&s;e Heads, which
therefore they pretend to be Miraculous. This
is one of the great <HI>Pilgrimages</HI> of the <HI>Germans,</HI>
and you &s;hall &s;carce meet with any Inhabi|tants
of the Country towards the Upper-<HI>Rhine,</HI>
who have not the Repre&s;entation of
this Miracle hanging in their Chambers, at
the bottom of which are the&s;e words,
<Q>Christi Sanguis Maladurni in Corporale est.</Q>
But we are not to believe that God works Mi|racles
without any Rea&s;on, or without &s;ome
Order, which may di&s;cover that &s;uch Opera|tions
proceed from his Hands: But what do
we meet with in this Figure, that bears this
Character? Would God, think we, demon&s;trate
to us, that the Blood of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t is
really pre&s;ent in the Sacrament after the Con|&s;ecration,
by repre&s;enting an hideous Picture
to us of &s;everal Heads, that are extreamly ill
made, and are not like one another? Or
would he by this means intimate to us, that
Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a Mon&s;ter, with many Heads?
This cannot be affirmed without the greate&s;t
Impiety. For my part, I am well a&s;&s;ured,
that no rea&s;on can be excogitated, that can
either far or near give us to under&s;tand, the
de&s;ign of this Figure. The Devil al&s;o is too
<PB N="117" REF="71">
cunning and &s;ubtil, to have had any hand in
it; for had it been his doing, he would rather
have made the Figure of &s;ome little pretty
Child, &s;uch as was that, which they &s;ay ap|peared
in an Ho&s;t, in the time of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI>
King of <HI>France.</HI> It remains therefore, that
we attribute this Artifice, to the good Curate,
who Celebrated Ma&s;s, and who was willing
at once, to draw the Devotion and the Mony
of People to his Church. A <HI>Jew</HI> being come
to vend &s;ome Commodities at <HI>Mentz,</HI> in the
Hou&s;e where I was Boarded, having &s;een one
of the&s;e Images hanging in the Stove, demand|ed
what it was? Whereupon I immediately o|pened
the Garden Door, and left him, leaving
the Woman of the Hou&s;e to an&s;wer him; for
as for my part, I knew not what to &s;ay to
him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> have not many Devotions in
their Country, but tho&s;e which they have are
very gro&s;s ones; they dre&s;s their Saints of both
Sexes, in &s;uch Antick Habits, that one cannot
forbear Laughing in &s;eeing them. In mo&s;t of
their Churches, they have Cro&s;&s;es of a Prodi|gious
bigne&s;s, and they put upon the Head of
the Figure, that repre&s;ents our Saviour, great
ugly Periwigs made of the gro&s;&s;er part of
Hair, and great Beards of Hemp.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much as I have made mention of the
Figure of <HI>Maladurne,</HI> I have a de&s;ire to give
you here a de&s;cription of &s;ome parts of a <HI>Pil|grimage,</HI>
undertaken to this Image, where I
<PB N="118" REF="72">
was pre&s;ent my &s;elf upon occa&s;ion, four years
ago. I was Travelling from <HI>Mentz</HI> to <HI>Franc|fort</HI>
about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; the mo&s;t commodi|ous
way to go thither is by Boat, which &s;ets
out from <HI>Mentz</HI> every Morning at &s;even a
Clock. By ill luck, or rather good luck, (be|cau&s;e
this &s;top procured me very diverting
Company,) I came too late by half an hour,
and the ordinary Boat was already got out of
&s;ight; but I found another there in the Haven,
which was ready to &s;et Sail, to go up the
<HI>Main</HI> to <HI>Francfort.</HI> This was a great long
Boat or Ve&s;&s;el, which could contain two hun|dred
Per&s;ons, and it was well nigh fill'd with
Per&s;ons of both Sexes, who went a <HI>Pilgrima|ging</HI>
to <HI>Maladurne.</HI> As &s;oon as I was entred
the Boat, they gave me a very good Place,
perceiving me to be a Clergy-man; only I was
obliged to be &s;ilent for the &s;pace of near two
hours, becau&s;e I came ju&s;t at the time of their
Meditation, which la&s;ted an hour, and which
was followed by many Prayers, and <HI>Ora pro no|bis,</HI>
which la&s;ted another hour. Afterwards
the Father Director of the <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> who
was a Father <HI>Capucin,</HI> having rung a little Bell,
gave them leave to go to break their Fa&s;t, and
&s;ilence together. Here it was that all our <HI>Ger|mans,</HI>
Men and Women, began to rummage
their Bags for Provi&s;ion; &s;ome produced Legs
and Shoulders of Mutton ready Roa&s;ted, o|thers
Gammons of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and Pies, and a
hundred other cold Meats, &s;uch as were com|modious
<PB N="119" REF="72">
upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, not forgetting
their great Pitchers and Bottels of Wine, and
they &s;trenuou&s;ly applied them&s;elves to Eating
and Drinking, after &s;uch a manner, as was
able to procure an Appetite to the mo&s;t diffi|cult
and di&s;ta&s;ted Spectators. Indeed there
were &s;ome among&s;t them, upon whom it was not
good to ca&s;t ones Eyes, becau&s;e their Viands
were &s;o &s;lutti&s;hly wrapt up, and they thumb'd
and devour'd it in &s;o &s;lovenly and bea&s;tly a
manner, that it was enough to turn ones Sto|mack
to &s;ee them. All the Meat that was in
the Boat, was not common to all the Compa|ny,
but they Eat in Troops or Knots, accor|ding
as aforehand they had a&s;&s;ociated them|&s;elves
together, of what they had brought a|long
with them, &s;o that &s;ome of them fared
much better than others. However they ex|pre&s;t
a great deal of re&s;pect to the Father Di|rector
of the <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> and his Companion,
by &s;ending them of the be&s;t they had upon
their Tables. The Father had the Civility to
invite me to come and Eat with him; but ha|ving
very well breakfa&s;ted at my Lodging,
before I came away, I returned him my
Thanks, without accepting of his kindne&s;s.
Neverthele&s;s, they were &s;o importunate with
me on every &s;ide, that I was forced to drink
with them; for in <HI>Germany,</HI> they account it
a great Crime for a Man to refu&s;e a Health;
and on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the&s;e, Men are forc'd
to incommodate them&s;elves, how unwilling
<PB N="120" REF="73">
&s;oever they may be. Their Breakfa&s;t la&s;ted
much longer than their Meditation; however
at la&s;t they were fain to make an end of it,
at the Fathers Ringing of his Bell: After
which having impos'd Silence, as well as he
could, he began a kind of Sermon, wherein
he di&s;cour&s;ed of the great and many Spiritual
advantages we receive by going on <HI>Pilgri|mage,</HI>
and more e&s;pecially by that of <HI>Mala|durne.</HI>
Above all, he in&s;i&s;ted upon the Relati|on
of a long track of Miracles that had been
wrought in that place, and which were very
Divertizing. Sermon being ended, the
Father <HI>Capucin</HI> put all that were in the Boat
upon making a Confe&s;&s;ion of their Faith, and
he began with his Companion, asking him a|loud,
Do you hold in Heart and Mouth, the
Catholick, Apo&s;tolick and Roman Faith? The
Brother an&s;wered, I do &s;o by the Grace of
God: The Brother put the &s;ame que&s;tion to his
Neighbour, Do you hold with Heart and
Mouth the Faith? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he again made
the &s;ame An&s;wer, and &s;o the &s;ame Que&s;tion
and An&s;wer run through the whole Boat from
one to the other, not excepting the Boat-men
them&s;elves. They told me that the rea&s;on of
their taking this Precaution was, to find whe|ther
there were any Hereticks in the Boat, and
if they had found any, they would have forc'd
them to leave the Boat, becau&s;e they were apt
to mock at their Sacred My&s;teries and Holy
Practices of <HI>Pilgrimaging.</HI> This Confe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="121" REF="73">
being ended, and all the Company having
been found good Catholicks, the Father re|ceived
the Vows of a Troop of <HI>Pilgrims,</HI>
which were come from <HI>Hockum</HI> that Morning,
and joyn'd them&s;elves to the re&s;t of the Com|pany
in the Boat. He made them all to kneel
before him, and made them &s;ay after him with
a lowd and audible Voice the&s;e words, <HI>I</HI> N.
<HI>do vow to go to the holy Relick of</HI> Maladurne, <HI>and
during the whole Journy, as well going as coming,
to be Obedient to the Reverend Father</HI> Bla&s;ius, <HI>Di|rector
of the Pilgrimage.</HI> This done, the Fa|ther
<HI>Bla&s;ius,</HI> (for that was the <HI>Capucin's</HI> Name,)
gave them his Benediction, and embraced
them one after another, and afterwards &s;ent
them to embrace the re&s;t of their Compani|ons.
I took notice that the Father expre&s;t a
great deal of Civility to the&s;e la&s;t come <HI>Pil|grims,</HI>
and plac'd them near to him&s;elf, on his
Right Hand. Now it is t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> be noted, that
<HI>Hockum,</HI> whence the&s;e Men came, is the place
where the very be&s;t Rheni&s;h Wine grows,
and whereof they had brought along with
them, a very plentiful Provi&s;ion. The&s;e there|fore
with a great deal of rea&s;on were placed
at the Right, and the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> of <HI>Bacrack,</HI> who
had po&s;&s;e&s;t that Place till then, were fain to
pa&s;s over to the Left. The Father having
Commanded the whole Company to kneel
down, pull'd out of his Sleeve a little Image
or Figure of the Miracle of <HI>Maladurne,</HI> and
having him&s;elf fir&s;t Ki&s;&s;ed all the Heads repre|&s;ented
<PB N="122" REF="74">
on it, he delivered it over from Hand
to Hand, that every one might do the &s;ame;
which done, he enjoyned the &s;aying of &s;even
<HI>Paterno&s;ters,</HI> in Honour to every one of the
Heads. Whil&s;t all the&s;e Ceremonies, Prayers
and Adorations were performing, the Boat
Arrived at <HI>Hoch&s;t,</HI> which is a &s;mall City, be|longing
to the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and where
they make an Hours halt to Eat their Dinners.
There be very good Inns in this Place, and
many &s;tept out of the Boat, either to Dine
there, or to buy more Provi&s;ions; but the great|e&s;t
part, remain'd in the Boat and Din'd
there. The Father <HI>Capucin</HI> was &s;o very im|portunate
with me, that he oblig'd me to &s;tay
with him. The&s;e kind of Boats are &s;o large
and long, that always at one end of them,
they have a very large Kitchin, where they
Boil and Ro&s;te what&s;oever the Company de|&s;ires.
The Kitchin hapned to be very well
furni&s;ht that day, and after that the <HI>Capucin</HI>
had craved a Ble&s;&s;ing, we &s;at down to Din|ner.
The heat and fumes of the Meat and
Pottage, had &s;o extreamly heated the Boat,
that one could &s;carcely fetch ones Breath in
it, and cau&s;ed a very unplea&s;ant &s;cent, for the&s;e
Boats are all covered with Boards, like Hou&s;es,
and they can let in no Air to them, but only
by the &s;ides, and by a Board on the top of the
Boat, which they can lift up, upon occa&s;ion.
I repented that I had been per&s;uaded to &s;tay
and Dine there, and that I had not &s;tept out
<PB N="123" REF="74">
to take a little fre&s;h Air, as others did. But
yet to countervail this Di&s;plea&s;ure, I took de|light
to &s;ee the <HI>Germans</HI> Eat at the rate they
did; for notwith&s;tanding the good Breakfa&s;t
they had made, they Eat with that Greedi|ne&s;s,
as if they had &s;een no Meat in three days.
God be prai&s;ed, &s;aid the <HI>Capucin,</HI> I &s;ee that
Devotion procures a good Stomack. He was
a Man of a very good humour, and who had
always a Je&s;t at command to divert the Com|pany
with; but neverthele&s;s he did one thing
which did much di&s;plea&s;e me, and was very
unbecoming the Gravity, which ought always
to be in&s;eparable from a long Beard, and e&s;|pecially
from one that is a Conductor and
Director of <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> Dinner being ended,
and the <HI>Capucin</HI> having given Thanks, he grant|ed
one hour of Recreation to the Company.
This Recreation con&s;i&s;ts in &s;peaking and act|ing
all &s;ort of Fooleries, and above all in
drinking Healths, and eating reli&s;hing Bits,
and Incentives to Drink, as Gammons of Ba|con,
dried Tongues, and other Salt-Meats.
The Father had for his part, a good Gammon
of <HI>Mentz</HI> before him; and having plac'd on
his right hand a great Bottle of Wine, which
the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> of <HI>Hockum</HI> had be&s;towed upon
him, and another great Bottle of <HI>Bacrack</HI>
Wine on his left hand, he plac'd them both
on each &s;ide of his Gammon of Bacon, and
Laughing &s;aid, with a loud Voice, &s;o that all
the Company might hear him, the&s;e Latin
<PB N="124" REF="75">
words taken out of the XXth Chapter of
S. <HI>Matthew,</HI> mo&s;t filthily profaning them:
<HI>Grant, that the&s;e two Bottles may &s;it the one on
the Right hand, and the other on the Left.</HI></P>
<P>After this he got into the be&s;t Humor of the
World, and drunk to admiration. I de&s;ired
him to tell me, why they were &s;o cautelous
to prevent, that no Hereticks might lurk in the
Boats among&s;t them: The Rea&s;on is, (&s;aid he)
becau&s;e they mock us; yea, &s;ome of them are
not afraid to abu&s;e us very in&s;olently. Once
upon a time (proceeded he) five or &s;ix of
the&s;e wicked Men play'd us a very ill Trick;
they had mix'd them&s;elves among&s;t the Pil|grims,
to ob&s;erve what we did. We di&s;co|ver'd
them at la&s;t, when after having wor&s;hip'd
the Holy Image, I &s;ent it about for them to
ki&s;s. One of them took it in his hand, and
in&s;tead of ki&s;&s;ing it, he with horrible Bla&s;phe|mies
threw it into the Water, &s;aying, That
<HI>that Image was more like the</HI> Hydra <HI>of</HI> Hercules,
<HI>or the Bea&s;t in the</HI> Revelations, <HI>than like Je&s;us
Chri&s;t.</HI> Our Pilgrims &s;eeing this horrible Im|piety,
ran to him with de&s;ign to have pull'd
him to pieces; but four or five other wicked
Wretches, his Companions, drew their Swords
in his defence, and to make way for him to
e&s;cape; and the only way was left him, was
to leap over-board, which he did, and by
Swimming got to the other &s;ide of the River.
The Rage our Pilgrims were in, to &s;ee this
Wretch was got out of their hands, made
<PB N="125" REF="75">
them fall upon the re&s;t, and one of them had
his Arm run through. I had much ado to
appea&s;e the Tumult; but at la&s;t I made them
call to mind the Obedience they had vow'd
to me; and they let the Hereticks go a&s;hoar,
after that they had &s;oundly beaten them. By
ill-luck for our Pilgrims, all this had hapned in
the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Francfort,</HI> whither we were
going, and where they are all Hereticks; and
the&s;e wicked Rogues had made ha&s;te and got
there before us, and had made their Com|plaints
to the Magi&s;trates; who &s;ent immedi|ately
to &s;top or arre&s;t our Boat, and they
carried us all Pri&s;oners to a great Tower,
where we were kept till the next day. We
expected all of us no le&s;s than to be made
Martyrs; but in&s;tead thereo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Magi&s;trates
having taken more particular Information of
the Matter, the next Morning &s;ent to us in a
manner to excu&s;e them&s;elves, and to tell us,
That they wholly di&s;approved the Action of
tho&s;e ra&s;h and giddy Youths; and if we had
made our Complaints of them, without abu&s;ing
them, they would have done us Ju&s;tice: But
however, fora&s;much as there had been &s;ome
Blood &s;pilt, we were condemned to pay the
Charges of the Ju&s;tice, and an hundred Gil|ders,
to be di&s;tributed among&s;t tho&s;e Prote|&s;tants
that had been abus'd by them. The
Mony was &s;oon found among&s;t our Pilgrims,
for all did not amount to Half a Crown apiece.
The Receiver to whom we paid our Mony
<PB N="126" REF="76">
told us, in a very girding manner, that the
only cau&s;e of all the&s;e Quarrels was, becau&s;e
in our Pilgrimages we &s;wallow'd down more
Rheni&s;h Wine, than Holy-Water. When
we were returned to our Boat, we found
almo&s;t all the Provi&s;ions of Victuals that we
had left; only they had taken care to vi&s;it our
Bottles and empty them, and fill'd them with
Water. After that again we had Embark'd
our &s;elves, I call'd to mind the Holy Image of
<HI>Malaturne,</HI> which the Heretick had ca&s;t into
the Water, and which we had quite forgot,
by rea&s;on of this Hurly-burly we were en|gag'd
in. I was in&s;pired of God, to &s;end &s;ome
of our Company in a little Boat to &s;eek for it;
and they found it miraculou&s;ly on the Shoar,
among&s;t the Sedge. It is the very &s;ame I have
&s;till at this day, and which all of you have
wor&s;hip'd this Morning. It was an Image of
Paper, fa&s;tned with Starch to a Piece of Wood;
neither was it any great Miracle, that being
&s;uch it did not &s;ink, or that it was &s;topt among&s;t
the Sedge. But however, the good Father took
it as a great honour to him. He told us this
Story with a great deal of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and
Laughing &s;aid, <HI>We &s;hall in the Evening &s;ee tho&s;e
Devils, that emptied our Bottles;</HI> he &s;aid not, <HI>Who
have profan'd our Image.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Father was telling this Story,
they drunk Healths to him from all Quarters;
and he very frankly Pledged them all out of
his two Bottles. When the Hour-Gla&s;s, which
<PB N="127" REF="76">
was turn'd up for the Hour of Recreation
was run out, they inform'd the Father of it;
and he having rang his Bell, all the Company
&s;hut up their Gla&s;&s;es and Bottles, and he took a
Book in his hand, to read a Spiritual Lecture,
which was to la&s;t one Hour; which was to be
followed with a Meditation of the &s;ame con|tinuance,
as in the Morning: After which, he
was to Preach an Hour, and then they were
to betake them&s;elves to their Afternoons Treat,
or Collation. The Father accordingly began
his Reading with a great deal of Vigor; but
he was not gon far, before that the Fumes
of the Wine having got into his Head, he
knew no more what he read, &s;o that his Com|panion
was fain to take the Book from him;
neither did he proceed much further in his
Reading: For finding that the Father Dire|ctor,
and mo&s;t of the Pilgrims, were Nodding
and Snoring on every &s;ide of him, he very
fairly laid down his Book on the Table, and
leaning his Head upon it, fell a&s;leep for Com|pany.
Never in my life did I &s;ee &s;uch an
Image of Devotion, as was then to be &s;een in
this Boat. Tho&s;e who could neither Sleep, nor
take Tobacco, &s;et them&s;elves to Chat together,
and to tell Je&s;ts and Merry Tales, to make
Laughter. They could not Play at Cards,
becau&s;e all manner of Gaming had been forbid
them. I for my part, being no Pilgrim,
got upon the Deck of the Boat, to take a
little Air; where I found a Gentleman of
<PB N="128" REF="77">
<HI>Mentz,</HI> whom I was acquainted with, and
with whom I di&s;cour&s;ed a good while con|cerning
this Pilgrimage. I told him, that I
was extreamly &s;candaliz'd to &s;ee &s;o much
Brutality acted among&s;t Chri&s;tians, and that
even in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Exerci&s;es, in which
they pretend mo&s;t to Devotion. He told me, that
I had &s;een nothing as yet; that they had yet a
Day and an half to be on the Water, and to
lead the &s;ame manner of life as I had &s;een;
and that afterwards they were to Land at a
certain place, from whence they had almo&s;t
two days Journy through Woods to <HI>Mala|durne,</HI>
which all of them went on Foot; That
this was the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and merry part of
all the Journy, for that they were us'd to go
and &s;ing among&s;t the Rocks, where there were
mo&s;t Ravi&s;hing Eccho's; afterwards, they
would go further, to find &s;ome plea&s;ant place
or other, where all the Company might &s;it
down upon the Gra&s;s, whil&s;t the Father was
Preaching to them.</P>
<P>After Sermon they continued their Journy
a little further, till they came to &s;ome de|lightful
place, among&s;t &s;hady Trees, where
they refre&s;h'd them&s;elves with Eating and
Drinking. The Father Director made tho&s;e
that were the mo&s;t able and &s;trong among&s;t
them, to carry the Provi&s;ions, be&s;ides what
every one carried of their own. Here they
did eat all of them in Common, and an
equal and abundant di&s;tribution was made to
<PB N="129" REF="77">
every one, both of Meat and Drink. The
greate&s;t trouble and inconvenience they have,
(&s;aid he) is to carry tho&s;e, who after their
Meals are found Drunk; for the&s;e the Men
were obliged to carry by Turns on their
Shoulders, or to lead them under the Arms,
until they had a little dige&s;ted their Wine.
If at any time it hapned, that the number of
tho&s;e that were Drunk, was too great for the
re&s;t to lead or carry them, then all the Com|pany
was oblig'd to make a Halt, till they were
come to them&s;elves again; for they are all
bound by Oath, not to leave any one of their
Company behind them, for fear of any Acci|dent
that might happen to them. The Father
<HI>Capucin</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elf always very favourable
to this &s;ort of People, becau&s;e frequently he
had been one of the number, and had been
in his Turn carried upon their Shoulders.
When the Pilgrims were arrived at <HI>Maladurne,</HI>
the Father Confe&s;&s;ed them, and Ab&s;olved them
of all the Faults and Exce&s;&s;es they had com|mitted
during their Journy, and gave them
the Communion with his own hands; after|wards
they went to Vi&s;it the Holy Relick; and
having &s;taid there the remainder of the Day,
he led them back again by the &s;ame way
that they came, to the Boat, making them
repeat the &s;ame Exerci&s;es they u&s;ed in go|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="78">
I de&s;ired this Gentleman to tell me, after
what manner the&s;e Pilgrims pa&s;s'd the Nights.
I knew already, that as long as they went by
Water, they laid down in the Boat, and &s;lept in
their Cloaths, every one in his place, in leaning
their Heads one upon another. And this in|deed
was in a manner the only thing that I
found to be very trouble&s;om in all their Pil|grimage.
But I was very de&s;irous to know,
how they Lodg'd when they Travell'd by
Land, and whether they could meet with Beds
enough for all their Company, con&s;idering
their great Numbers? The Gentleman, at
this Que&s;tion of mine, fell a Laughing, and
told me, That he found that I was not over
well acquainted with the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Germany;</HI>
and that there were no Beds to be found,
except only in great Cities, and along the
Upper <HI>Rhine,</HI> where I had Travelled: But,
that in all other Parts, there were none to be
found; and that Travellers thought them&s;elves
very happy, when they could meet with fre&s;h
Straw to lye upon. The way therefore of our
Pilgrims Lodging was after this manner: They
got into Barns, or the Pea&s;ants Hou&s;es, where
they procur'd for their Mony &s;ome Bundles of
Straw, which they &s;pread upon the Floor, and
&s;tretch'd them&s;elves along upon it, like Herrings,
Men and Women pel-mel together, of what
condition &s;oever they may be, without having
any thing wherewith to cover them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="78">
True it is, that I had already had &s;ome
experience hereof; for having once pa&s;&s;ed up
the <HI>Rhine</HI> from <HI>Collen</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI> with a Count
of the Empire, who had with him the
Counte&s;s his Wife, and two Sons; we were
fain to lye two Nights upon Straw, in
two pitiful Villages, without being able &s;o
much as to procure a Bed for the Counte&s;s.
The Rats and Mice skipt over our Faces all
Night, and we had nothing to cover our &s;elves
with, &s;ave only our Cloaks. However, I did
not conceive this to be &s;o common in <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
as this Gentleman inform'd me. We
were yet engaged in our Di&s;cour&s;e about our
Pilgrims, when we heard the noi&s;e of our
<HI>Capucins</HI> Bell; this made me go down into the
Boat, to &s;ee what they were going about next.
I found the <HI>Capucin</HI> a rubbing of his Eyes, and
demanding what of the Clock it was, and
how far we were got. They told him, that
he had Slept three Hours, and that they were
come near to <HI>Francfort.</HI> He te&s;tified his Trou|ble,
that he had not been in a condition to put
them upon their Holy Exerci&s;es; but <HI>the Spirit
is ready,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>and the Fle&s;h weak.</HI> Well,
there was now no remedy; and fora&s;much as
he perceiv'd that the Collation Hour was
come, he enjoyn'd all the Company to fetch
out their Bottles. The Pilgrims therefore fell
again as heartily to their Eating and Drinking,
as if they had neither Eaten nor Drunk all the
Journy. Indeed the thing I admir'd mo&s;t,
<PB N="132" REF="79">
was to &s;ee, how they could Eat and Drink at
the rate as they did; and yet this was not all,
for two Hours after they were to go to
Supper.</P>
<P>They had &s;carcely begun their Collation,
when the Boat arrived at <HI>Francfort.</HI> I &s;tept
out of the Boat in the Haven, after having
taken my leave of the Father, and all his Holy
Company, who were to &s;tay there an Hour,
to take in &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions. If I had
not had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Francfort,</HI> which I
could not put off, I believe I &s;hould have
been induc'd to Accompany the&s;e Pilgrims
to <HI>Maladurne,</HI> and by this means &s;hould have
been in a condition, to have given you an
entire de&s;cription of this Pilgrimage, and of
the plea&s;ant Adventures, which &s;eldom fail of
being coincident with them; but for want of
a favourable opportunity, I can give you no
more but this &s;mall &s;hred of it. I &s;hall only
tell you, That this was the good Fathers Trade
all the Summer long. When the Pilgrims
had performed their Vows, he brought them
back again to the place where he had taken
them up, after having fir&s;t given them a great
Benediction, and &s;ome Indulgences, which he
&s;aid he had received of the Pope; and thus
having di&s;patched them, he provided him&s;elf
again with others.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="79">
See here the good Fruit which the Miracle
of the &s;pilling of the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t
has produc'd, which was wrought to confound
the Prote&s;tants, and to repleni&s;h the Children
of the Church with Heavenly Graces. I &s;hall
not need trouble my &s;elf in Moralizing this
Subject any further, as being that which car|ries
its Moral along with it. I only beg Par|don
of the Prote&s;tants, for the Shame I have
caus'd them in relating &s;uch a Story; and the
Fault I have committed herein was the greater,
becau&s;e it had no great reference to my <HI>Nea|politan</HI>
Journy; neither indeed had I in&s;erted it,
but becau&s;e this Second Days Journy from
<HI>Veletre</HI> to <HI>Terracine</HI> prov'd very dry and barren,
and did not furni&s;h me with &s;ufficient Matter
to entertain my Reader. However, I cannot
but think, that &s;uch like Matters of Fact may
in &s;ome &s;ort de&s;erve to be made Publick, and
I don't believe I &s;hall have occa&s;ion, to write
of them any more. And &s;o I return to my
Journy.</P>

a mo&s;t &s;ad Spectacle pre&s;ented it &s;elf
to our Eyes: We &s;aw about a Score
of <HI>Sbirries,</HI> who &s;urrounding the Hou&s;e of a
Pea&s;ant, had block'd up all the Avenues there|of,
and who&s;e Countenances &s;hewed, that
they had met with a Prize. Having enquired
<PB N="135" REF="80">
what the matter was, they told us, That they
had &s;eized a Nun, who had made her E&s;cape
from a Convent, with the help of a young
Man, who had &s;tollen her away. The de&s;ire
we had of &s;eeing her, made us &s;tay there above
an Hour. At la&s;t, they brought her forth out of
the Hou&s;e, with Irons on her Hands and Feet.
They &s;et her upon a Hor&s;e, to which they
bound her fa&s;t with a great Chain, which
they had put round her Wa&s;te. She did not
&s;eem to be above Eighteen years of Age, and
was tolerably hand&s;om. She made dreadful
Outcries and Lamentations, and the De&s;pair
that had &s;eiz'd her was &s;o great, that &s;he beg'd
of all the Pa&s;&s;engers, they would be &s;o kind as
to kill her. She made &s;everal Attempts, to
throw her &s;elf down from her Hor&s;e, but all
in vain; for they had bound her &s;o fa&s;t, that
it was impo&s;&s;ible for her. We were not above
Five Miles from <HI>Fondi,</HI> whither they were
carrying her, and we followed her all the
Way, at le&s;s than half a quarter of a Miles
di&s;tance. The Throng of People, that came
running in from all Parts to &s;ee her, was &s;o
great, that we had much ado to enter the
Town, for fearing le&s;t &s;ome In&s;urrection
might be caus'd by &s;o Tumultuous an A&s;&s;embly.
As &s;oon as &s;he was entred, they &s;hut the Gates,
and we were forc'd to &s;tay without near five
Hours; after which, with a great deal ado,
we at la&s;t made a &s;hift to get in. Every one
&s;poke &s;o differently of the Matter, that it was
<PB N="136" REF="81">
very difficult for us to learn the preci&s;e Truth;
but the greate&s;t certainty we could gather
from their Relations were, That it was only a
&s;imple E&s;cape of a Nun, who did not like her
being coup'd up in a Convent. She was of
the Order of S. <HI>Francis;</HI> but they told us, That
about a Month ago, three Nuns of the Order
of S. <HI>Bernard,</HI> had made their E&s;cape with bet|ter
&s;ucce&s;s; for having taken their Way to|wards
the Sea-Coa&s;t, they met with a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Ve&s;&s;el, that took them in. The Relation of
&s;o &s;trange an Adventure touch'd me to the
Heart, and fill'd me with a ju&s;t Indignation
again&s;t the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> for having ere|cted
&s;uch States of endle&s;s Re&s;traints, and &s;o
contrary to Natural Liberty, that tho&s;e who
have been &s;o unhappy as to be engag'd in them,
are afterwards de&s;irous to quit them&s;elves
thereof, at the co&s;t of embracing a perpetual
Slavery among&s;t a mo&s;t Barbarous People, and
the greate&s;t Enemies of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>I had conceiv'd a de&s;ign in the LETTERS
I have Publi&s;hed, to Treat of the Nuns of
<HI>Italy;</HI> but &s;ome Rea&s;ons having oblig'd me,
to Publi&s;h them &s;ooner than I intended, I
had not the lei&s;ure to reduce that Matter in
order, which yet is of importance enough,
not to be pa&s;s'd over in Silence. Wherefore
I &s;hall &s;peak of them here, by occa&s;ion of this
Nun of <HI>Fondi,</HI> and &s;hall make it the Enter|tainment
of this Third Days Journy.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="81">
I do not pretend here to di&s;cour&s;e of the
In&s;titution of Nuns in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
It is known, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame
may be thought ancient enough, yet is indeed
but novel, and took its ri&s;e at a time,
when many other Weeds of <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> began
to over-grow the Church. I &s;hall only make
it my bu&s;ine&s;s, to repre&s;ent the State of the
Nuns as it is at pre&s;ent. The Motives which
engage them to this kind of Life, their Occu|pations
or Employments in the Convents, and
their Intriegues abroad, together with the Scan|dals,
which this forc'd kind of Life doth from
time to time produce.</P>
<P>We may a&s;&s;ert in General, That all the
Mona&s;teries of the Females in <HI>Italy,</HI> are very
well Founded, that is, Endowed, except &s;ome
few, where the Nuns profe&s;s the Poverty of
S. <HI>Francis;</HI> as tho&s;e are, who are called the
Poor <HI>Clari&s;&s;es,</HI> and &s;ome others. Be&s;ides the&s;e
great Foundations, they have al&s;o a Ca&s;ual
Revenue, which amounts to no le&s;s than their
yearly Incoms: For all of them take in Pen|&s;ioners,
and there is never a Religious Hou&s;e,
that hath not at the lea&s;t Three&s;core or Four|&s;core
of them, who all pay great Pen&s;ions.
The <HI>Italians</HI> put out their Daughters to Board
in Convents, in like manner as we put them
here to Boarding-Schools, to learn all &s;orts of
Work becoming Gentlewomen. There are in
every Convent &s;ome Nuns deputed to take the
care of the&s;e Boarders, and Teach them.
<PB N="138" REF="82">
All their Works belong to the <HI>Nuns,</HI> who Sell
them, driving a con&s;iderable Trade by this
means to their great Profit. The <HI>Italians</HI> &s;end
their Young Daughters at the Age of five or
&s;ix Years into the Mona&s;teries, and of this
great Number, &s;ome are to return again to
their Parents, after a certain time, and the
re&s;t make them&s;elves, or are forced to become
<HI>Nuns;</HI> &s;o that the&s;e Schools are the fruitful
Nur&s;eries, whence the Mona&s;teries are People|ed
and receive their Complement, and with|out
which they would &s;oon become De&s;erts,
there being few <HI>Italian</HI> Families, who have
&s;een a little of the World, and are come to
the Age of Di&s;cretion and Knowledge, that
are willing freely to Impri&s;on them&s;elves there,
notwith&s;tanding they be kept in a kind of con|tinual
Slavery in their own Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Parents of the&s;e little Boarders, know
&s;o well how to command the Spirits of the
<HI>Nuns</HI> that Govern them, that by this means
they do what they plea&s;e; and to di&s;cover the
Secret in one word, it is by Pre&s;ents. If they
have a de&s;ire that their Daughter &s;hould be a
<HI>Nun,</HI> the&s;e Governants and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es forget
nothing of what they think may incline them
to it. They will talk to them a thou&s;and times
a day, of the advantages of a Religious Life,
which may be reduced according to them, to
the following Heads:</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="82">
In the Fir&s;t place, they will tell them, that
a <HI>Nuns</HI> Habit, becomes them extreamly well,
and that the Vail makes them look as hand|&s;ome
again, as the common &s;ecular Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they &s;hall be always &s;ure
to Eat and Drink of the be&s;t, and that they
&s;hall never want any thing conducive to a
plea&s;ant recreative Life.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That they &s;hall live in great Ho|nour,
and that after two or three years, they
&s;hall have the re&s;pect of being called Mo|thers.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That they &s;hall always have the
freedom to &s;ee and &s;peak with their Kinsfolks
and Friends at the Grate; yea, to Treat them
with good Dinners, and &s;plendid Collations
in the Parlour, with the Mony that &s;hall be
allowed them for their Boarding.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That afterwards they &s;hall be dig|nified
and rai&s;ed to Religious Charges and
Employments, one of them &s;hall be Mi&s;tre&s;s
of the Novices, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">ther the Governe&s;s of the
Boarders, others again Sacri&s;tans, Over&s;eers
of the Provi&s;ions, Priore&s;&s;es; yea, that all of
them in their Turns, may become Lady Ab|be&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>And in the Sixth and La&s;t place, They do
not fail to add to all the re&s;t, that they &s;hall
be &s;ure of Eternal Life. To this purpo&s;e a
<HI>Nun</HI> of <HI>Vicenza</HI> told me very plea&s;antly, that
they Preached only &s;ix Beatitudes to them,
and that they always wanted two to make
<PB N="140" REF="83">
them perfectly happy, <HI>viz.</HI> Liberty and a
Husband.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there be many other le&s;&s;er
Rea&s;ons, which may engage Young Girls to
make them&s;elves <HI>Nuns.</HI> Some enter upon this
kind of Life, becau&s;e they have &s;ome of their
Kindred that are <HI>Nuns;</HI> they have an Aunt
or a Cou&s;in in the Mona&s;tery, or &s;ome She
Friend of theirs. Others engage them&s;elves
in this Profe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they know that they
cannot make &s;o fair a Figure in the World,
as they fain would; others again, becau&s;e
they find the Mona&s;tery, the Gardens, and
Chamber allotted them, to their liking; and
&s;ome al&s;o, becau&s;e they are at liberty to Je&s;t
and play the Fool, as much as they plea&s;e. In
a word, a hundred other Motives of this Na|ture,
do not fail to give the fir&s;t &s;tart to the
Vocation of the&s;e Girls. But the mo&s;t un|happy
of them all, and tho&s;e whom I truly
pity, are tho&s;e, who not &s;uffering them&s;elves
to be cajoll'd by the&s;e petty Amu&s;ements,
have their Thoughts fixed upon the lo&s;s of their
Liberty, upon the great Temptations they ex|po&s;e
them&s;elves to, and who, be&s;ides all this,
have a natural Antipathy again&s;t all the&s;e kind
of Maxims, and who openly prote&s;t, they
can never re&s;olve to embrace a Mona&s;tick
Life; and yet for all this, will they nill they,
mu&s;t do it; their Parents, from a Family-Inte|re&s;t,
will have it &s;o; the&s;e Cruel and Unnatu|ral
Mon&s;ters pre&s;s them to it; and if this proves
<PB N="141" REF="83">
Ineffectual, they proceed to Outrageou&s;ne&s;s
and Blows; yea, even to threats of killing
them with their own Hands, if they do not
pronounce the impious and Sacrilegious Vows;
for &s;o I call tho&s;e Vows which are made a|gain&s;t
ones Will, and where the Will doth nei|ther
accord with the outward act, nor with
the Tongue that utters them.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to relate to you the Ce|remony
that is performed &s;ome days before
the&s;e Young Virgins take upon them the Re|ligious
Habit. They allow them a Week to
go and take their leaves of their Kindred and
Friends, and they Attire them in the Riche&s;t
Clothes that can be had, and which are com|monly
Embroidered with Pearls and Precious
Stones, that have been borrowed up and down:
They put a rich Crown upon their Heads,
and a Scepter in their Hands, as it were to &s;ig|nifie
thereby, that they are entring upon a
State of Life preferable to that of Queens, and
in this Pomp they are led in a Coach through
the City, and carried to all their Kindred,
where they never fail of being Sumptuou&s;ly
Entertained. There are no Young Women,
who &s;eeing them pa&s;s by, with all this Pomp
and Magnificence, do not wi&s;h them&s;elves to
be in the &s;ame Condition. But the Mi&s;chief
of it is, the Fe&s;tival doth not la&s;t always, and
the day of their putting on the Habit comes,
in which the&s;e Young Ladies are carried in
Triumph to the Convent; as &s;o many Victims
<PB N="142" REF="84">
they are going to offer up to the Avarice of
their Parents, to the Intere&s;ts of their Family,
or to &s;ome other Predominant Pa&s;&s;ion; for as
for the Glory of God, that is not a thing that
comes in competition in <HI>Italy,</HI> on the&s;e &s;ort of
Occa&s;ions. The mo&s;t part of <HI>Nuns</HI> will tell
you, two or three years after their Profe&s;&s;ion,
that they have been impos'd upon, or that
they have deceived them&s;elves, and that the
Motives which have enclin'd them to embrace
this kind of Life, were &s;ome little fooli&s;h Con|ceits
or Trifles, the de&s;ire whereof has quite
left them. But poor unhappy they, there is
no Remedy left for them.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of their taking the Habit
are very Magnificent, and no le&s;s Ridiculous.
The Abbe&s;s of the Convent will needs appear
at this Solemnity, in her Pontifical Habit,
and Acts the Farce of <HI>Pope-Joan,</HI> with her
Cro&s;ier-Staff in her Hand, and her Miter up|on
her Head: The &s;ignings with the Cro&s;s,
and the a&s;per&s;ions of Holy-water are never
wanting in abundance. But after a great
many Preliminaries, they come to the point
in Hand, which is to unca&s;e the&s;e Maidens of
their Secular Habits, and to put upon them
tho&s;e of the Religion. And all this while they
have gayety enough in their Looks; but when
they come to cut off their Hair, then it is
that the mo&s;t of them can hold no longer,
but bur&s;t forth into Tears; which probably
proceeds from &s;ome remainder of Love, they
<PB N="143" REF="84">
&s;till have for that, which they have taken &s;o
much pains to Cultivate and Adorn, and that
which makes the faire&s;t Ornament of the <HI>Ita|lian</HI>
Ladies, who cannot endure any thing up|on
their Heads, but their own Hair, which
they frizle, curle and bind up in different
manners, enterlacing them with Flowers ei|ther
Artificial or Natural. It may be al&s;o,
becau&s;e at that time, they have a more Lively
Sen&s;e of the lo&s;s of their Liberty, they are
then entring upon. For tho' they are allow'd
one or two years of Novitiate, before they
make Profe&s;&s;ion, or engage them&s;elves by a
Solemn Vow, yet they never afterwards re|fu&s;e
to do it. The <HI>Italians</HI> have reduc'd a
<HI>Nuns</HI> leaving her Mona&s;tery, to that pitch of
Di&s;honour and Infamy, that a Maid who had
been Whipt by the publick Executioner, in
the mo&s;t publick places of the City, or who
had been Stigmatized and &s;tood under the
Gallows, might appear with le&s;s &s;hame in
Company, than a Religious, who &s;hould leave
the Mona&s;tery after &s;he has taken the Habit.
So that after once they have made the fir&s;t
&s;tep, they are in a fair way, or rather in ab|&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity of making the other al&s;o.</P>
<P>And fora&s;much as the bu&s;ine&s;s here lies ra|ther
in quitting the World, than the Spirit of
it; the <HI>Nuns</HI> are very cautelous, not to re|ceive
any <HI>Nun</HI> among&s;t them, without being
a&s;&s;ured of a Pen&s;ion for them from their Pa|rents,
of at lea&s;t 100 Crowns a year, which
<PB N="144" REF="85">
&s;erves purely and &s;imply to buy her things &s;he
has a mind to, and which may give her &s;ome
&s;atisfaction and palliate her Re&s;traint. I knew
a <HI>Nun</HI> of the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap|ti&s;t</HI>
in <HI>Bononia,</HI> whom her Parents allowed a
Pi&s;tol every day; with this Mony they buy
the Materials they &s;tand in need of for their
Works, which afterwards they pre&s;ent to
&s;ome of their Friends, or el&s;e Sell them for
Mony. They are al&s;o obliged with the &s;aid
Mony to perform the Offices of their Religi|ous
Order, by turns, at their own Charges.
She who is the Sacri&s;tan, mu&s;t during her
year of Officiating, provide the Wine that
is u&s;ed at Ma&s;&s;es, and the Wax that is Burnt
upon the Altar. The Over&s;eer of the Mouth
Provi&s;ions mu&s;t Treat the <HI>Nuns</HI> at her own
Charges, at the Principal Fe&s;tivals of the year,
with all manner of Curio&s;ities and Dainties.
They are oblig'd al&s;o every one in their turn,
to furni&s;h a Ma&s;s for their Preacher, and their
Confe&s;&s;or; and herein it is, they endeavour
to outvie one another, which is the rea&s;on
why the&s;e Fathers lead &s;uch Delicious Lives,
and are &s;o indulgent in Pardoning of their
Sins, to whom they are beholding for &s;o many
good Bits. Be&s;ides all this, they have the li|berty
of Treating their Relations and Friends,
who come to Vi&s;it them at the Grates, and of
giving them Collations in the outward Parlour.
In a word, I am &s;ure, that if their Pen&s;ions
were Ten times more than they are, they
<PB N="145" REF="85">
would not be to &s;eek for Means to &s;pend them.
This nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;o much Mony, at
one da&s;h, excludes all poor Maidens, and
tho&s;e of midling Condition from all Religi|ous
Hou&s;es, and their Parents find it more for
their Intere&s;t to Marry them, except they
have a mind to make Convert Si&s;ters of them,
(that is, Servants to the other Nuns,) or poor
<HI>Clari&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The Convents of Nuns are no otherwi&s;e
lookt upon at pre&s;ent, than as a convenient
means of di&s;charging Families of &s;upernume|rary
Encumbrances. The <HI>Italians</HI> commonly
Marry no more than one or two of their
Children, and &s;o all the re&s;t are forced to
become Prie&s;ts or Monks, if they be Boys, or
Nuns, if they be Girls. However it mu&s;t
co&s;t them a Pen&s;ion, for without it, they will
never be received. The Call of God to any
of the&s;e States, is no longer owned, except
they bring along with them a good Pur&s;e to
atte&s;t it. Is it not a thing to be Lamented,
to &s;ee the Papi&s;ts have the impudence to re|proach
the Prote&s;tants, that they have Sacrile|giou&s;ly
aboli&s;hed the&s;e Sacred Retreats, where
the Virgins have their Liberty, <HI>to follow the
Lamb whither&s;oever he goes?</HI> Is it not evident
as the Sun at Noon-day, that before they will
open their Gates to them, the Enquiry is not
whether they have <HI>Oil in their Lamps,</HI> but
whether they have <HI>Mony in their Pur&s;es?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="86">
Let us now take a view, how tho&s;e who
have the happine&s;s to be Admitted, do employ
their time there. I confe&s;s, I &s;peak &s;omewhat
improperly, for no Body is permitted to go and
take a view of them; but however, we may
make a gue&s;s of it by the Works that come from
them; the mo&s;t Curious Laces and Points, the
mo&s;t rich and &s;umptuous Embroideries, and the
mo&s;t exqui&s;it Handy-works, Artificial Flowers,
Pretty Knacks and Curio&s;ities, with a thou&s;and
other Toys, are the mo&s;t &s;erious Occupations
of the&s;e Holy Reclu&s;es; &s;o that indeed, tho'
they be retir'd from the World them&s;elves,
they are wholly bu&s;ied to glut and &s;atisfie the
Vanity of it in others. But the Ma&s;ter-piece
wherein they excel, is their Skill in preparing
all Dainties and Enticements of the Palat, to
pre&s;erve Fruits, to make Sweet-Meats, dry and
liquid, all &s;orts of Pa&s;try-Works, and White-Meats;
all which &s;hews them to have very
dainty and licori&s;h Palats. All this is com|priz'd
in <HI>Italian</HI> under the Words of <HI>Roba Dolce,</HI>
or <HI>Roba di Monache: If any would have
them to make a Piece of Pa&s;try, or to Dre&s;s any
other dainty Di&s;h, they mu&s;t &s;end them as much
more of the Ingredients, as can enter the Compo|&s;ition;
for it is known, they will be &s;ure to take the
one half for them&s;elves; and be&s;ides, they mu&s;t pay
Dearer for the Fa&s;hion, than it would co&s;t them at
the Cooks: But withal it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that they
get for their Mony &s;omething that is far more
neatly done, and delicious, than if the Cooks had had
the handling of it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="86">
If they &s;eem Covetous on one hand, on
other Occa&s;ions again you'l find them as Libe|ral
and Profu&s;e; yea, one may &s;ay of them,
That they do not addict them&s;elves to Avarice,
but that they may be in a better condition to
exerci&s;e their Liberality. When any Fe&s;tivals are
celebrated in their Churches, all the Prie&s;ts
and Monks that Officiate in Saying Ma&s;s, are
&s;ure to be di&s;mi&s;t with their Handkerchiefs fill'd
with Biskets and dried Sweet-Meats; and they
who perform the Evening-Service, are afterwards
conducted to the Parlour, where they have
a Collation pre&s;ented them, of all manner of
exqui&s;it Dainties and excellent Wines. I once
hapned at <HI>Milan</HI> to be pre&s;ent at one of the&s;e
Collations of the Nuns of the Mona&s;tery <HI>Ma|giore.</HI>
All the Cru&s;t of their Pa&s;try-Work
were made of Almonds, Pine-kernels, and
Pi&s;taches, which had been beaten or ground
into Flower. An Old Prie&s;t &s;eeing this Exce&s;s,
could not hinder him&s;elf from &s;aying, <HI>O, Dio,
Come potiamo mangiar que&s;to &s;enza Peccato!
Good, GOD, Is't po&s;&s;ible to eat this without Sin!</HI>
But a young Nun an&s;wered him, <HI>Si, &s;i Signor,
&egrave; co&s;a buena per i vecchi: Ay, ay Sir, It is a good
thing for Old Men.</HI> They are more ready at
their Je&s;ts and Drollery, than tho&s;e who are
mo&s;t Conver&s;ant in the World. Yea, what is
more, there reigns in their Cloi&s;ters a Spirit
of <HI>Impudence, Effrontery,</HI> and <HI>Impiety,</HI> beyond
what is found el&s;ewhere; which proceeds, as
I believe, from the &s;ecret Rage they have
<PB N="148" REF="87">
conceiv'd, for having lo&s;t their Liberty. They
abandon them&s;elves, as far as they are able,
to all manner of Luxury; and were it not that
Mode&s;ty well becomes a Writer in this kind
of Matters, I could relate Facts to you that
would make your Hairs &s;tand on end. In
order to remove all occa&s;ions of &s;uch Enor|mities,
the <HI>Italian</HI> Bi&s;hops have taken care to
double their Grates, which were only &s;ingle
before, as they are &s;till to this day in <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Germany.</HI> The fir&s;t Grate is about a Foot
di&s;tant from the &s;econd Grate; and the Bars
are &s;o clo&s;e &s;et together, that one cannot
thru&s;t in his Fi&s;t. Moreover, they have mo&s;t
expre&s;ly forbid all manner of Per&s;ons, as well
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as Civil, (except it be Kindred

<P>In a word, it may be truly &s;aid, That they
have taken more Precautions, to hinder all
Men from Vi&s;iting them, than if they were
&s;truck with the Plague. But yet all the&s;e rigo|rous
Prohibitions, do not hinder their Parlours
from being always well fill'd with Company;
and the <HI>Sbirries,</HI> who have Orders to make a
&s;earch in the Parlours, and at the Grates of

Convents, dare not &s;o much as come near
them; for all the&s;e Nuns commonly have very
powerful Relations and Friends, who would
take care to get their Legs and Arms broke
for them, &s;hould they ever offer to attempt
the lea&s;t thing that might di&s;plea&s;e them. To
&s;peak the Truth, the&s;e Prohibitions &s;erve only
to enflame the <HI>Italians</HI> the more, to go and
Vi&s;it them, if it were for no other thing, but
becau&s;e it is a thing forbid. <HI>Omnis Praevarica|tio

yet more a&s;toni&s;hing, is, That the Bi&s;hops for|bid
all Prie&s;ts upon pain of Su&s;pen&s;ion and
Impri&s;onment, to celebrate Ma&s;s in the Con|vents
of Nuns, without having an expre&s;s

<P>We may ea&s;ily perceive from all this, the
high Opinion the Pa&s;tors of the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> have of the Virtue of their Holy Re|clu&s;es;
and without que&s;tion they have rea&s;on
for their taking all the&s;e mea&s;ures about them.
The Prie&s;ts are forbid to &s;peak with them, be|cau&s;e
Experience hath taught, that in their
Di&s;cour&s;e they did only Cajole and Court them.
They are forbid to make them any Pre&s;ents,
becau&s;e they are well a&s;&s;ured, that the Prie&s;ts
never give any thing for nought. And in the
third place, they forbid them having any Com|merce
with them in any other manner; I leave
<PB N="153" REF="89">
it to you to conjecture what the meaning of
that may be.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts, for their parts, do not much
concern them&s;elves with all the&s;e Threats.
They &s;ay, That Su&s;pen&s;ion <HI>Ip&s;o facto</HI> &s;ignifies
nothing, except it be publickly declared by a
Sentence; and they know well enough, that
their Colleagues will never proceed to &s;uch an
Extremity again&s;t them; fora&s;much as in their
time, they have been as guilty of the &s;ame
Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as them&s;elves. Some will have
it, That the Puni&s;hment of Su&s;pen&s;ion with
the re&s;t expre&s;t in the Licence, cannot light
upon any, but &s;uch who are guilty of all
the Particulars there prohibited, that is, who
Di&s;cour&s;e with, &s;end Pre&s;ents, write to them,
and have commerce with them; but that they
who di&s;cour&s;e, or have commerce with them,
without Writing, are not of that number.
In a word, The mo&s;t Clear-&s;ighted perceive,
that the&s;e Prohibitions are only made to &s;e|cure
the Honour of the Superiors, who other|wi&s;e
might be accu&s;ed by the Seculars, for
conniving at all the&s;e Di&s;orders, which daily
happen in the&s;e Matters, and which, according
to a Je&s;uitical Interpretation, are &s;ufficient to
quiet their Con&s;ciences. They &s;ay, That the
Bi&s;hops after all, never had the intention of
Su&s;pending them. Thus notwith&s;tanding they
Court the Nuns, yet they continue to &s;ay Ma&s;s,
and to perform all the Sacerdotal Functions,
without feeliny the lea&s;t &s;cruple in &s;o doing.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="90">
The <HI>Italians</HI> do not always pay their Vi&s;its
to the Nuns for the Love they bear them, but
more frequently to con&s;ult with them, and
concert the means of accompli&s;hing &s;ome
great de&s;ign, or to manage &s;ome Intriegue
abroad. The Nuns commonly have the quali|fication
of a Devili&s;h Spirit, and it is matter
of a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee, how young Women
&s;hut up in Cloy&s;ters, as in a Pri&s;on, are not|with&s;tanding
able to act at a great di&s;tance
with &s;o much power and efficacy. Is a Man
engaged in an unju&s;t Trial, or does he &s;tand in
need of the Favour of &s;ome Great Per&s;on; the
be&s;t means for him to &s;ucceed, next to the
Je&s;uits, is to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the Nuns. Has
a Man a mind to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">mpa&s;s &s;ome Amorous pro|ject;
if you can but once get them to embark
in it, you may be in a manner &s;ure of &s;uc|ceeding.
I &s;hall to this purpo&s;e relate to you,
the &s;ubtil Intriegue of a Nun of <HI>Milan.</HI></P>
<P>A certain Count courted a young Lady,
whom he was extreamly pleas'd with; but he
had no means of &s;eeing her, &s;ave only at
Church, when &s;he went on Sundays to Ma&s;s,
or &s;ometimes in pa&s;&s;ing by her Window, after
the <HI>Italian</HI> manner. He had taken notice of
the young Ladies Smiling on him, and from
thence concluded, that without doubt &s;he
would prove favourable to his Wi&s;hes: So that
nothing remained now, but the finding out a
way for a free and &s;ecret Interview, wherein
the Count found an in&s;uperable difficulty;
<PB N="155" REF="90">
for her Mother, who was a Woman of Honour,
was &s;o true a Sentinel to her Daughter, that
&s;he was in&s;eparable from her, and never &s;tirr'd
out of Doors without taking her along with
her. This was a bu&s;ine&s;s indeed, that requir'd
the Intriegue of a Nun to compa&s;s it. He ad|dre&s;&s;eth
him&s;elf to an Ancient Mother of the
Mona&s;tery <HI>Magiore,</HI> to whom he promis'd 20
Crowns, in ca&s;e &s;he could make him obtain his
de&s;ire: The Old Nun undertakes it. To this
effect &s;he writes a Letter to the Lady, wherein
&s;he de&s;ires her to come and &s;peak with her, for
that &s;he had &s;ome &s;ecret and charitable Ad|vice
to give her concerning the Carriage of
her Daughter, and &s;ignifies the Hour, which
would be mo&s;t proper for her to come. The
Mother being very impatient to know what
the matter might be, did not fail of going to
her, leaving her Daughter at Home. When
&s;he was come, the Nun told her, That &s;he had
&s;ent for her, to put her in mind to double her
Care in ob&s;erving her Daughter; that it was
taken notice of, that a Count was pa&s;&s;ionately
enamour'd of her; and that her Daughter
an&s;wer'd him with Ca&s;ts of her Eye. She made
a &s;hift, with her long Di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;tay this
good Woman near two Hours in the Parlour;
and all this while the Count, who had received
all nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tructions, was with the young
Gentlewoman. The Mother return'd to her
Hou&s;e, with a Re&s;olution to make good u&s;e of
the Advice the Nun had given her; but the
<PB N="156" REF="91">
more a&s;&s;iduous her Precautions were, the more
rea&s;on &s;he found to be a&s;toni&s;h'd, after &s;ome
Months at her Daughters, being big with
Child. She urged her to that degree, that &s;he
oblig'd her to declare how the thing had hap|ned.
But what could the Mother do? It
would have been in vain for her to have un|dertaken
to trouble the Nun upon this account,
becau&s;e in &s;o doing, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of her
Daughters Honour, &s;he might very well have
lo&s;t her own Life into the bargain; for the
Nuns are no le&s;s able and expert in bringing
about their Revenge, than in managing a
Love intriegue. The mo&s;t part of the violent
Deaths that hapen in <HI>Italy,</HI> are carried on by
their means, and therefore it is that I have
&s;aid, that they have a devili&s;h Spirit. Tho&s;e
that have any Enemies in <HI>Italy,</HI> are very cau|tious
of drinking any Liquors of their Pre|paring,
or of their Sweet-Meats, or Pa&s;try-Work.
There are too many fune&s;t Examples
to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is to be &s;een in the Mad-hou&s;e at
<HI>Milan</HI> a poor Gentleman, whom they make
to pa&s;s for a Fool or Madman, tho' indeed
he be not &s;o. The thing was brought about
by the Stratagem of a Nun, the account was
given me of it, is as follows. This Gentleman
had a younger Brother, who was de&s;irous to
make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of his E&s;tate; in order
whereunto he took occa&s;ion to get his Brother
go along with him to Vi&s;it the Nuns, who be|&s;towed
<PB N="157" REF="91">
a Collation upon them, and the Elder
Brother having drunk a Do&s;e, fell down to
the Ground, as if he had been quite Dead.
However the Poi&s;on it &s;eems had not been
&s;o well prepared, but that he came to him&s;elf
again. The Nuns in the mean time being ex|treamly
concern'd that their de&s;ign had not
&s;ucceeded, Publi&s;hed that he was a Fool, and
that they had &s;een him carry him&s;elf like a
Changeling in the Parlour: Whereupon his
Brother cau&s;ed him to be Seized, and to be
carried to the Mad-hou&s;e. It is a place from
whence no Body is ever &s;uffer'd to come forth,
and where all the actions and words of tho&s;e,
whom they have once thru&s;t in there, be they
never &s;o rational and compos'd, are interpre|ted
and wre&s;ted to Folly. It was to &s;pecial
purpo&s;e for him to &s;ay there that the Nuns had
Poi&s;oned him, when they made that a &s;trong
argument to prove him a Fool, for entertain|ing
&s;uch thoughts of them. And by this
means his younger Brother is at pre&s;ent &s;till
in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his E&s;tate. This was the
account they gave me of this Story.</P>
<P>That which makes the Nuns &s;o bold and
daring in the&s;e &s;ort of Enterpri&s;es, is, becau&s;e
the Civil Magi&s;trate cannot take cogni&s;ance of
any thing they do, and their Superiors that
Govern them, receive too many good Treats
from them, ever to u&s;e them roughly. Be|&s;ides,
the mo&s;t Rigorous Sentence that can be
Pronounced again&s;t them, is to Condemn
<PB N="158" REF="92">
them to be &s;hut up in the inmo&s;t part of their
Mona&s;tery, and to Fa&s;t &s;o many days a Week,
with Bread and Water. They them&s;elves do
execute the Sentence, for no Body hath the
power to enter into their Convents to force
them to it; &s;o that we mu&s;t not imagine them
to be &s;uch Fools, as to be overcruel to one
another. And if an Abbe&s;s or Superiour,
&s;hould attempt to have the Sentence executed
according to the Rigor of it, they would get
the whole Body of Nuns about their Ears. So
that by this means, they are &s;ecur'd from the
fear of ever dying an infamous Death; yea,
or &s;o much as to &s;uffer any thing con&s;iderable,
whereas a poor Secular Female, being con|vinc'd
of the like Crimes, would be drag'd to
the Gallows, or Burnt alive. Nay, there are
&s;ome who excu&s;e them of all the&s;e Enormi|ties,
upon the account of their being Reclu|&s;es;
for why do the Seculars, &s;ay they, go to
them? We mu&s;t not come near the Bea&s;t, if
we have no mind to be bit by it. And they,
on the other hand, conceive they may ju&s;tly
deceive the World, becau&s;e they have once
for good and all deceived them, and made
them lo&s;e their Liberties, by forcing them
to become Nuns.</P>
<P>The Roman Catholicks may well expect
that the&s;e Mon&s;trous Vocations, will one day
produce nothing but Mon&s;ters. 'Tis too great
a Violence done to the natural Right, which
every one hath to his Liberty, to pretend to
<PB N="159" REF="92">
force people to a Condition, which they can
never after change: But it is &s;till a greater
Tyranny to handle tho&s;e as the mo&s;t infamous
Criminals, who make the lea&s;t attempt for to
recover it. The following Hi&s;tory which is
a very true one, and happened at <HI>Milan</HI> about
four years ago whil&s;t I was there, is a mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible proof thereof. A <HI>Dominican</HI> Nun of
the Number of tho&s;e; whom their Parents
force to &s;hut them&s;elves up in a Cloi&s;ter, hav|ing
made &s;erious Reflections upon her engage|ment,
found that her Parents in order to de|ceive
her the better, had fal&s;ified the Date of
the Extract, which they had taken out of the
Regi&s;ter of her Bapti&s;m, and had made her
a year older than indeed &s;he was, to engage
her the &s;ooner in a Mona&s;tick Life. For it
is to be noted, that the Canons declare all
tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions to be Null and Void, which
are made before a certain Age, there pre|&s;cribed,
tho' there be but one day wanting;
and our Religious was not ignorant of it.
She therefore re&s;olved to quit her &s;elf of her
Profe&s;&s;ion, as being null and invalid. The
Abbe&s;s of the Convent gave advice thereof
to her Parents, who immediately repaired to
the Mona&s;tery, and having given a con&s;ide|rable
Sum of Mony to the Abbe&s;s, they de|&s;ired
her to joyn with them, to hinder her
coming out from thence. The &s;horte&s;t and
&s;ure&s;t way was to make her pa&s;s for a Fool.
Accordingly the Abbe&s;s and &s;ome of her Con|fidents
<PB N="160" REF="93">
Publi&s;h'd that her Brains were crackt;
but becau&s;e &s;he was not &s;o Craz'd, but that
&s;he could upon occa&s;ion, give good Rea&s;ons
of what &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was forbid the Parlour,
and never &s;uffer'd to come to the Grates. Thus
this poor Creature was forc'd to live in this de|&s;olate
manner for &s;ome years, without being
able to come to the Speech of any Body.
In the mean time, having dexterou&s;ly ma|nag'd
the Spirit of a Conver&s;e Si&s;ter, &s;he took
upon her to deliver a Letter from her, to the
Cardinal Archbi&s;hop, to whom only it be|longs
to take Cogni&s;ance of the Affairs of
Nuns in extraordinary Ca&s;es. She mo&s;t humb|ly
repre&s;ented to him, in her Letter, the rea|&s;ons
&s;he had to reclaim or retract her Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
and the great Cruelties which the Ab|be&s;s,
at the In&s;tigation of her Parents, had ex|erci&s;ed
again&s;t her, &s;ince they had di&s;cover'd
her Intent. The Cardinal far from being
touch'd by the Ju&s;tice of the&s;e Remon&s;tran|ces,
&s;uppos'd, that by granting her Reque&s;t,
he would give an occa&s;ion to the re&s;t of the
Nuns, to follow her &s;teps, and make them de|&s;irous
to examine the day and hour of their
Profe&s;&s;ions: Wherefore he immediately &s;ent
his Orders to the Abbe&s;s, to &s;hut her up more
clo&s;ely than before; conformable to which
Order, &s;he was &s;hut up in the inward Pri&s;on
of the Mona&s;tery, where &s;he continued five
years, with the allowance only of a little
Bread and Water for her Nouri&s;hment, and
<PB N="161" REF="93">
being cruelly Whipt thrice a Week. The
Nuns, as I have &s;aid before, exerci&s;e a very
&s;weet and mild Ju&s;tice one towards another;
but if there be any found among&s;t them, who
have a mind to quit the Convent, to the&s;e
they are inexorably Pitile&s;s and Cruel. They
fear, le&s;t being got out from among&s;t them,
they might Divulge the infamous Wickedne&s;s
they commit, and as an hone&s;t Man told me,
they are of the humour of the Devils, who
wi&s;h Men would Damn them&s;elves, to have
the more Company in Hell. <HI>Solatium mi&s;e|rorum
e&s;t habere Pares: 'Tis a comfort to mi&s;e|rable
Per&s;ons that they are not alone.</HI> Our poor
Pri&s;oner in this her extream Mi&s;ery found none,
but this &s;ame Conver&s;e Si&s;ter, who had deli|ver'd
her Letter to the Cardinal, that had
any pity for her, who took upon her, to de|liver
another Letter for her, which &s;he had
addre&s;t to an Hone&s;t Gentleman, in whom
&s;he had a great deal of Confidence; who ac|cordingly
re&s;olv'd with one of his Friends, to
do his utmo&s;t endeavour to &s;et her at Liberty.
He, by means of this Conver&s;e Si&s;ter, furni&s;ht
her with In&s;truments to break her Pri&s;on;
and on a certain Night, according to the Mea|&s;ures
they had before taken, they drew her
with Cords over the Wall, and being entred
into the Coach, that &s;tood ready for her, &s;he
de&s;ir'd the Gentlemen to carry her to <HI>Genoa.</HI>
The Nuns in the mean time, took &s;o chari|table
a care of this poor Creature, that a day
<PB N="162" REF="94">
and almo&s;t two Nights pa&s;t, before ever they
perceiv'd that &s;he had made her e&s;cape; and
&s;he was already arriv'd at <HI>Genoa,</HI> before the
Report of it came to <HI>Milan.</HI> The Nun be|ing
got to <HI>Genoa,</HI> about Eleven a Clock at
Night, made the Gates to be open'd to her,
and having taken up her Lodging in the be&s;t
Inn, &s;he pre&s;ently &s;ent to acquaint one of the
Principal Magi&s;trates of the City, that &s;he de|&s;ir'd
&s;ome Body might immediately be &s;ent to
take the care of her, and to di&s;charge the
two Gentlemen, that had brought her thither,
that all might be &s;atisfi'd of their Hone&s;ty
and good intent in this Undertaking; and
that they had not endeavour'd to Steal her
away upon any motive of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.
This Sage and prudent behaviour of hers,
which did not at all be&s;peak her a Fool, as her
Enemies mi&s;repre&s;ented her, was well approv'd
of by the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Genoa.</HI> They re|ceiv'd
her with extraordinary kindne&s;s, and
promis'd to afford her their utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance.
They appointed Commi&s;&s;aries to receive the
Rea&s;ons of her leaving the Mona&s;tery, and
having found them good and ju&s;t, they writ
to the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> to inform his Holine&s;s
what had pa&s;t, and to receive his Orders about
it. It was in the Papacy of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. who
was a great Enemy to all tho&s;e, who de&s;erted
their Convents; for they &s;ay of him, that he
&s;ent to the Gallies every one of the Monks,
who after having quit their Mona&s;teries,
<PB N="163" REF="94">
humbly addre&s;t them&s;elves to him for Relief,
without hearing any of their Rea&s;ons. Con|formable
to this Humor of his, he order'd the
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Genoua,</HI> not to meddle any
more in that matter; and immediately to &s;end
back the Nun to her lawful Superior, the Car|dinal
Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Milan,</HI> who would take
care to do her Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This Order was very cruel; for this Cardi|nal
being accu&s;ed by the Nun, for having
been &s;o far from hearing her Remon&s;trance,
when &s;he had recour&s;e to him, that he cau&s;ed
her to be Impri&s;oned and Abu&s;ed, was become
her mo&s;t dangerous Adver&s;ary. This made
the&s;e Gentlemen, to write a &s;econd time to the
Pope, to repre&s;ent to him the&s;e Inconveniences,
and to di&s;charge their Con&s;ciences. But <HI>Inno|cent</HI>
the XIth was too firm in what&s;oever he
had once re&s;olved on, (and it may be this was
the only Fault he had) and redoubled his for|mer
Orders, with greater expre&s;ne&s;s than be|fore,
threatning them (in ca&s;e of delay) with
Excommunication. Thus the&s;e Gentlemen, who
were unwilling to involve them&s;elves in Trou|ble
for the &s;ake of a Nun, &s;ent her back three
Months after, with a good Guard, to <HI>Milan:</HI>
Every one pitied her condition, and believed
the Archbi&s;hop would receive Orders from
<HI>Rome,</HI> for to hear her Ca&s;e. But in the mean
time, &s;he was &s;ent back to her Convent, and
the Nuns &s;hut her up in her Dungeon, and
three or four Months after &s;he was never heard
<PB N="164" REF="95">
of more. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women have great rea&s;on
to ble&s;s GOD, that &s;uch a Barbarous Tyranny
is at la&s;t aboli&s;h'd in <HI>England;</HI> for they may be
&s;ure, that if ever <HI>Popery</HI> &s;hould &s;et her Foot in
<HI>England</HI> again, they would not fail to build
Pri&s;ons for them every where (I mean Mo|na&s;teries,)
where, in &s;pight of their Teeth, they
would be made to renounce the World. It
being therefore a thing in a manner impo&s;&s;ible,
for a Nun ever to get out of a Mona&s;tery,
it is much better for them never to think of
it.</P>
<P>Now fora&s;much as the Profe&s;&s;ion of renounc|ing
the World, does not make one really dye
to it; &s;o they &s;eem, on the contrary, to have
taken the re&s;olution of cleaving to it more than
ever, and to follow the Maxims of it, as far as
is po&s;&s;ible for them to do, and more than it
may be they ever would have done, had they
&s;taid in it. Their Habit ought to be very plain,
without Pride or Affectation; but we find that
they have been very ingenious in reducing
them to another pa&s;s. Only &s;etting Silk a&s;ide,
which they may not wear, they u&s;e the fine&s;t
and mo&s;t curious Woollen Stuffs they can
meet with; and every thing about them is &s;o
neatly made, and to that degree of Curio&s;ity
and Exactne&s;s, that there is no uneven Fold or
Stich to be found in them; and certainly, there
be a great many to whom a Religious Habit
is much more advantagious, than a Secular, a
making them to appear more comly and hands
<PB N="165" REF="95">
&s;om. Some of them let their Hair grow on
the fore-part of their Heads, and take great
care in frizling of it. They wear al&s;o Laced
Head-dre&s;&s;es under their Veils, as likewi&s;e
Neck-Laces, Bracelets, and Pendants in their
Ears; and in a word, the mo&s;t of them Paint
them&s;elves to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>I went once to ask leave to &s;peak with a
Nun of the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Thomas</HI> at <HI>Vicenza.</HI>
She made me &s;tay for her an Hour and an half
in the Parlour, and came at la&s;t &s;o Curl'd and
Painted, that &s;he e'en frighted me. She excus'd
her &s;elf, for having made me &s;tay &s;o long, be|cau&s;e
for&s;ooth, &s;he dur&s;t not pre&s;ent her &s;elf
before me di&s;orderly. This Nun gave me a
plain and downright de&s;cription of all that
pa&s;t in her Mona&s;tery; the Antipathies, the
Jealou&s;ies, the Amorous Intriegues, and the
Parties that reign'd among&s;t them. They were
at that time in a great Divi&s;ion among&s;t them|&s;elves;
&s;ome being of the Emperor's Faction,
others of the <HI>French</HI> Kings. They who were
of the Emperor's Side, could not endure to
hear the others &s;peak well of his Enemy. There
hapned one day (as &s;he told me) a very furious
Battle between them, upon this account.</P>
<P>A Nun at Dinner-time drunk a Health to the
<HI>French</HI> King: The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> not being able
to brook it, they came to Words, and from
Words to Blows. They flung the Di&s;hes and
Plates, and what&s;oever el&s;e came next to hand,
at one anothers Heads; &s;he &s;hewed me her Veil,
<PB N="166" REF="96">
which was yet all &s;tained with a Sawce out of
a Di&s;h they had flung at her. This vexed her
more than all the re&s;t; for the <HI>Italian</HI> Women,
but more e&s;pecially the Nuns, are exceeding
neat and cleanly: She endeavour'd her Re|venge
in flinging a Cha&s;ing-di&s;h full of hot
Coals in the Face of the Party that had thus
Affronted her. And &s;he continued to demand
of me, Whether there might not be means
found to &s;ignifie her Bravery to the <HI>French</HI>
King, and that &s;he doubted not, but that if he
were informed of the Zeal &s;he had for his
Glory, he would &s;end for her to <HI>Paris,</HI> and make
her an Abbe&s;s there. The&s;e poor Maidens are
very apt to intoxicate them&s;elves with a thou|&s;and
&s;uch like Fancies. When they are weary
of Quarrelling and beating one another, then
they betake them&s;elves to Je&s;ting and Fooling,
and compo&s;e Comedies and Farces to make
one another Laugh.</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> now Lord Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> did not exaggerate the matter,
when he &s;aith, That <HI>He had &s;een &s;ome of them
that were not over mode&s;t.</HI> They make no diffi|culty
of repre&s;enting in their Plays, <HI>Venus</HI>'s
and <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s wholly to the Life; they Sing
profane Songs, and altogether unworthy and
unbecoming Per&s;ons con&s;ecrated to God; they
act Dances and Po&s;tures that are extream La&s;ci|vious,
and all that they &s;peak in them, is
commonly conceiv'd in Terms admitting a
double &s;ignification, whereof one &s;en&s;e is al|ways
<PB N="167" REF="96">
either impious or wanton. They com|monly
have very excellent Voices, and under|&s;tand
Mu&s;ick perfectly well; but if there be
any impure or la&s;civious Air, that is that which
plea&s;eth them be&s;t, and which they make
choice of, to entertain the Company with.
That which is the mo&s;t enormous thing of all,
is, that not only in the&s;e their Comedies, but
al&s;o (O unheard of Profanation!) in their
Divine Offices for Sundays and Fe&s;tivals, they
intermix the&s;e filthy Songs, which they bla&s;|phemou&s;ly
pretend to be made in imitation of
the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Solomon.</HI> All the Debauched Youth
of the City, about this time, flock'd to the
Church of the <HI>Coele&s;tines</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> where the&s;e
Nuns equally tickled their Ears and Fancies
by the &s;weetne&s;s and la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s of their
Songs. The Scandal grew at la&s;t to that Ex|ce&s;s,
that the Cardinal &s;ent his Orders to have
their Church &s;hut up, and ab&s;olutely forbad
them to &s;ing Mu&s;ick any more.</P>
<P>'Tis the Cu&s;tom in the World, for Men to
Court Women; but in the&s;e Religious Orders,
on the contrary, the Nuns Court the Men;
they write Amorous Notes to them; they &s;end,
to entreat them to come and &s;ee them; and
there are few Nuns, that have not two or
three, to whom they are more particularly
linked in Affection; and they are &s;o well skill'd
in di&s;po&s;ing their Timos, that they never meet
together in the Parlour. They are very Jealous
of them, and &s;hould they once under&s;tand, that
<PB N="168" REF="97">
any one of their Lovers had di&s;cours'd with
any other Nun, be&s;ides them&s;elves, they would
immediately quit them, and would find a time
to be revenged on them. I take them to be
very unhappy in this, That they de&s;ire &s;o
&s;trongly, what is &s;o difficult for them to enjoy.
Some among&s;t them do &s;o far enflame their
Imaginations about their Amours, that they
run Di&s;tracted; and others are &s;o immoveably
determind to what they long for, that they
actually apply them&s;elves to the inventing of
Means, that may bring them to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of what they de&s;ire: Of the&s;e, &s;ome give
them&s;elves to the Devil; and to this purpo&s;e
they tell a Story, That upon a time, a Nun
being re&s;olved to give her &s;elf to the Devil;
He plainly told her, <HI>He would not have her, be|cau&s;e
&s;he was more Devil than him&s;elf.</HI> 'Tis for
this Rea&s;on that we are told &s;o many Stories
of Nuns, that are Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Others endeavour
for Mony to corrupt the Turn Keys and Maid-Servants,
that have the Care of the Outward-Gates,
to admit their Gallants at Night by the
Tower. Some have pluck'd away whole Grates
from the Parlours; others have broke through
the Walls, or have made Pa&s;&s;ages under|gro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">d;
and it happens frequently enough,
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> their Cunning, they get the Keys of
the Great Gate of the Mona&s;tery from under
the Lady Abbe&s;&s;es Pillow; or that they are &s;o
happy to meet with one Key or other, that can
unlock it. There is al&s;o another Little Gate in
<PB N="169" REF="97">
the Ve&s;tries, by which the Prie&s;ts enter, to go
and carry the Holy Sacrament and Extream
Unction to tho&s;e that are Sick, and by which
they convey the Ornaments of the Altar:
Now, to get the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Door, they
need only to gain her who is over the Ve&s;try.
But the mo&s;t &s;ure way to obtain their de&s;ires, is,
when a whole Community of Females agree
together, to take their Plea&s;ures. Of this
there hapned a mo&s;t infamous In&s;tance, about
&s;even or eight Years &s;ince, among&s;t the Nuns
of <HI>Bre&s;&s;e,</HI> which made a great deal of Noi&s;e in
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Religious finding them&s;elves quite
weary of keeping their Vow of <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> agreed
among&s;t them&s;elves to admit their Lovers into
the Mona&s;tery, and having all bound them|&s;elves
in an Oath of Secrecy, they wrought
hard, to make a Pa&s;&s;age Under-ground, under
the Walls of their Enclo&s;ure, and which was
to end in the Hou&s;e of a young Gentleman,
who was one of the Plot. Their Undertaking
had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that the Nuns enjoy'd the
Galants as often as they plea&s;ed. In the mean
time there was ob&s;erved a great change in
the&s;e Reclu&s;es; they became more mode&s;t in
the Parlour, and more a&s;&s;iduous in the Quire,
than ever the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> had been before. Their Con|fe&s;&s;or,
who was a very Aged Man, being inca|pable
of taking part in their Amours, was not
thought fit to be admitted to the Secret. They
informed him in their Confe&s;&s;ions and &s;ecret
<PB N="170" REF="98">
Conferences, that they felt from time to time
&s;uch Ravi&s;hments and Internal Joys, as they
could no way expre&s;s; without telling him,
whether they belong'd to the Soul or Body.
And this good Man, who took all in the be&s;t
&s;en&s;e, and who al&s;o attributed in part this
their Conver&s;ion, to his own good Prayers for
them, went to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bre&s;&s;e,</HI> and made
his Report to him; telling him, That <HI>his Nuns
were all of them become Saints to that degree, as
to &s;uffer Ex&s;ta&s;ies and Ravi&s;hments.</HI> The great
Opinion the World had conceived of their
Sanctity &s;till increa&s;ed more and more, when
the greate&s;t part of the&s;e Nuns undertook to
ob&s;erve a Six Months Retirement in the Inner
part of their Mona&s;tery; making a Vow, That
during all that time they would never come to
the Grate: This was to hide their Big-bellies,
and Child-bearing.</P>
<P>In a word, they had many Children, and
this infamous Commerce la&s;ted many years.
The World has been &s;ince a&s;toni&s;hed to con|&s;ider,
how it was po&s;&s;ible to be concealed for
&s;o long a time, without making a Noi&s;e in
the World; for there were above a Score of
Youths that were of the Gang. However, as
Wickedne&s;s always drags its own Chain, this
al&s;o was di&s;cover'd at la&s;t by the Cook-Maid.
This Si&s;ter finding her &s;elf abandoned and
neglected, becau&s;e &s;he was very Ugly; and
moreover, finding her &s;elf overcharg'd with
Work, by rea&s;on of the Cawdles and Broths,
<PB N="171" REF="98">
and a thou&s;and other extraordinary things,
which &s;he was oblig'd to make for tho&s;e that
were in Child-Bed. Be&s;ides, whenever the
young Galants came at Night, they always
brought &s;ome dainty Bit or other along with
them, which &s;he mu&s;t Dre&s;s for the re&s;t. One
of the Nuns, on a time, having very indi&s;|creetly
jeared her for the bigne&s;s of her No&s;e,
&s;he was &s;o extreamly nettled at it, that in
Revenge, &s;he by way of Raillery reproach'd
her with her Big-Belly: From the&s;e &s;tinging
Je&s;ts, they proceeded to high Words, and in
fine, the Cook-Maid was ba&s;ely abus'd by them.
The next Morning &s;he &s;ends a Letter to the
Vicar-General of <HI>Bre&s;&s;e,</HI> wherein &s;he informed
him, That &s;he had a Matter of great con&s;e|quence
to di&s;clo&s;e to him, provided care were
taken to &s;ecure her Life from the Revenge of
the other Nuns. The Grand-Vicar was &s;o
po&s;&s;e&s;t with the high E&s;teem he had conceiv'd
for the&s;e Reclu&s;es, who of late had undertaken
the Reforming of them&s;elves, with &s;o much
Edification, that having heard what the Cook-Maid
had to &s;ay, he immediately called her a
Vi&s;ionary. But &s;he per&s;i&s;ting to maintain what
&s;he had di&s;covered to him; and offering to
make it appear, that three of the Nuns were
actually with Child, and that two of them had
been lately brought to Bed; the Grand-Vicar
at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to perform a Vi&s;itation of the
Convent. Many of the Nuns perceiving, that
there was &s;omething extraordinary in this
<PB N="172" REF="99">
Proceeding, endeavoured to make e&s;cape out
of the Mona&s;tery; but they were all &s;topt in
their flight, and brought back to their Con|vent,
where they found very pretty Children,
Males and Females, in the Cells of the&s;e Nuns,
who call'd them their Mothers.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop having been inform'd of it,
drew up an Indictment, and &s;ent it in all dili|gence
to the Tribunal of <HI>Venice,</HI> which is
e&s;tabli&s;hed to take cognizance of Matters re|lating
to Nuns; (for <HI>Bre&s;&s;e</HI> is a <HI>Venetian</HI> City,
depending upon the Republick both in Tem|porals
and Spirituals.) This Tribunal is very
&s;evere, and never fails of puni&s;hing things with
the extreame&s;t vigour. In the mean time all
the Young Men, who knew them&s;elves guilty,
had time to &s;ave them&s;elves, &s;ome in <HI>Swi&s;&s;er|land;</HI>
others in the Country of the <HI>Gri&s;&s;ons;</HI> and
others in <HI>Germany,</HI> as having by good-luck
nothing but the <HI>Alpes</HI> to pa&s;s. Some days after, a
Sentence was pronounc'd and publi&s;h'd again&s;t
them, as &s;evere as ever had been &s;een. Their
Goods were confi&s;cated, their Hou&s;es razed to
the ground, and their Heads &s;et at a price. I
was troubled to find among&s;t this number one
of my Scholars, the Son of a Procurator of
S. <HI>Mark;</HI> but &s;ome time after, I had the &s;ati&s;|faction
to under&s;tand, That he was come freely
of his own accord, to put him&s;elf in Pri&s;on, in
order to his Ju&s;tification; which he did to &s;o
good purpo&s;e, that he was acquitted.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="99">
There were many Per&s;ons in <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pecially
among&s;t the Prie&s;ts and Nuns, who condem|ned
this &s;o &s;evere and &s;o publick Proceeding of
the Republick, which had made the matter to
be much more Nois'd abroad, than otherwi&s;e
it would have been. They &s;aid, it would have
been much better to have &s;uppre&s;t it wholly,
as they do at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in all the other Go|vernments
of <HI>Italy;</HI> becau&s;e the Hereticks on
the other &s;ide of the Hills, and more e&s;peci|ally
<HI>Geneva,</HI> are never wanting, when &s;uch
Matters as the&s;e happen, to make the be&s;t Ad|vantage
of it, or, to make u&s;e of their Phra&s;e,
to <HI>Butter their Cabbage with it.</HI> As for the Nuns,
they contented them&s;elves with &s;etting a &s;trict
Guard upon them for &s;ome time, and with
&s;topping up the Conveyance they had made
under their Walls. For above a year together,
the Gentlemen of <HI>Bre&s;&s;e</HI> dur&s;t not pa&s;s along the
Streets, near to their Mona&s;tery, for fear of
incurring a &s;ini&s;ter Su&s;picion. See here the
common End of the Amorous Intriegues of
Nuns, and tho' indeed they do not always
make &s;o much Noi&s;e, it is becau&s;e tho&s;e who
ought to take cognizance of them, pretend to
have more Prudence than the Tribunal of
<HI>Venice</HI> made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There be two &s;orts of Superiors of Nuns in
<HI>Italy;</HI> for &s;ome of them are immediately &s;ub|ject
to Bi&s;hops, and others to &s;ome Generals
of Orders, of the &s;ame Rule that they profe&s;s.
Tho&s;e that are under the Conduct of Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="174" REF="100">
are &s;omewhat better Govern'd; but they
who are under the in&s;pection of Monks, do
for the mo&s;t, wholly give the Reins to their
Pa&s;&s;ions, and lead a mo&s;t infamous Life, tho'
with le&s;s Noi&s;e. The Monks will &s;carcely
ever &s;uffer any Seculars to frequent the Grates
of tho&s;e whom they Govern, that they may
keep the Affections of the&s;e Maidens entirely
to them&s;elves. If any di&s;order chance to hap|pen,
all is kept very &s;ecret, becau&s;e this would
turn as much to their Di&s;honour, as to the
di&s;grace of the Nuns. There are a Thou&s;and
Stories abroad in the World, of the Loves of
Monks and Nuns, and I find no difficulty to
give credit to them, &s;ince the Information I
my &s;elf have had thereof, during my abode
in <HI>Italy,</HI> from Per&s;ons, whom I can belive;
but am re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s them by in &s;ilence,
for fear of offending Cha&s;t Ears.</P>
<P>'Tis a Prodigious thing to &s;ee how Nuns
have multipli'd them&s;elves in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the
va&s;t quantity of Convents they have, as well
in every City, as in the Country. There are
almo&s;t as many different Orders of them, as
there are of Monks. Among&s;t the re&s;t there
are al&s;o She Je&s;uits, which commonly are
call'd <HI>Ur&s;ulines,</HI> who more particularly un|dertake
to In&s;truct Young Girls. In <HI>Italy</HI>
they are oblig'd to be Cloi&s;ter'd, tho' in
<HI>Switzerland</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> they are not under
that engagement. I was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee that
the <HI>Italians,</HI> who are accus'd of be|ing
<PB N="175" REF="100">
become &s;o effeminate &s;ome Ages &s;ince,
have not yet introduc'd among&s;t them a plea|&s;ant
Order of Nuns, which is extreamly
multipli'd in <HI>France;</HI> I mean that of <HI>Fonte|vrault,</HI>
which contains &s;omething &s;o odd in its
In&s;titution, and in its Ob&s;ervances, that for|a&s;much
as I do not believe I &s;hall have any
opportunity of entertaining you further about
Nuns, I &s;uppo&s;e you will not find it di&s;agree|able,
if I give you here a &s;hort Relation of
them, if it were for nothing el&s;e but to re|pre&s;ent
to you, to what a height Folly
and Delu&s;ion are mounted in the Church of
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>A Per&s;on who&s;e Name was <HI>Robert d' Ar|bri&s;&s;el,</HI>
having been followed by a great num|ber
of Men and Women, in the Woods of
<HI>Fontevrault,</HI> who had been per&s;uaded by his
Preachments to embrace a Mona&s;tick Life,
he gave them the Habit, and placed them in
&s;everal Cels in the Year 1100. And being
of a very complai&s;ant Humour for the Sex,
he undertook to overthrow the Order of God,
and of Nature, to oblige Women, by giving
them the Superiority over Men. Some &s;ay he
did this, becau&s;e of the great Devotion he
had to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and more parti|cularly
to honour the Recommendation Je&s;us
Chri&s;t made of S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> to his
Mother, when he was upon the Cro&s;s, as
may be &s;een in the XIX Chap. of the Go&s;|pel
of S. <HI>John,</HI> Ver&s;. 26, and 27. <HI>When Je|&s;us
<PB N="176" REF="101">
therefore &s;aw his Mother, and the Di&s;ciple
&s;tanding by, whom he loved; he &s;aith unto his
Mother, Woman, behold thy Son. Then &s;aith he
to the Di&s;ciple, behold thy Mother. And from
that Hour that Di&s;ciple took her to his own Home.</HI>
He pretended it might be gather'd from
hence, that Women were to Command Men;
at lea&s;t he conceiv'd, that Men acquired a
greater degree of Perfection, by &s;ubmitting
them&s;elves to be obedient to them. Accor|dingly,
he would have the Monks &s;hould
oblige them&s;elves by a Solemn Vow of Obe|dience
to the Nuns, and make Profe&s;&s;ion be|tween
the hands of the Lady Abbe&s;s. Pope
<HI>Pa&s;chal</HI> confirm'd his Order, which &s;ince that
time multiplied exceedingly, e&s;pecially in
<HI>France,</HI> where it had its fir&s;t Ri&s;e. It hath
been the wonder of the&s;e la&s;t Ages, why the
Popes have &s;uffer'd &s;o long an Order, which
may with good rea&s;on be lookt upon as the
greate&s;t Shame and Reproach of the Religi|ous
Orders of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Endea|vours
have been made, to per&s;uade &s;ome of
the late Popes to &s;uppre&s;s it, but the great
Ladies that have been Abbe&s;&s;es thereof, Fif|teen
of them having been Prince&s;&s;es, and
among&s;t them Five of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI>
have had &s;o much Power, that by the inter|po&s;ition
of the Authority Royal, they have
always hindred it. It is the Si&s;ter of Madam
<HI>de Monte&s;pan,</HI> who at pre&s;ent is their Lady
Abbe&s;s; &s;he met with abundance of oppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="177" REF="101">
at fir&s;t, for the&s;e Nuns who were already
accu&s;tom'd, of a long time, to have none but
Prince&s;&s;es for their Abbe&s;&s;es, would not ac|cept
of her; and that which made them the
more to di&s;ta&s;te her was, the motive for
which this place was be&s;towed on her; how|ever
the ab&s;olute Will of the King, has in fine
prov'd in&s;tead of a Principality to her. I am
in a Condition to acquaint you with &s;ome
Specialities, concerning the pre&s;ent Conditi|on
and Spirit of this Lin&s;ey Wool&s;ey Order;
for having had two Uncles that were Monks,
and an Aunt that was a Nun of that Com|munity,
whom I often went to Vi&s;it; I
came by this means to be very particularly
informed about them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place to give you &s;ome De&s;cripti|on
of the Abby of <HI>Fontevrault.</HI> It is Situated
three Leagues from <HI>Saumur</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> upon the
Confines of <HI>Touraine.</HI> It was formerly a di&s;mal
Place, full of Woods and Thickets; but at pre|&s;ent
it is very plea&s;ant, as being extreamly well
cultivated and improv'd, and enjoys a very
good Air. There are Five Mona&s;teries,
whereof Three are of Nuns, and Two of
Monks, without counting the Palace of the
Lady Abbe&s;s, which is a Stately Building.
The fir&s;t of the&s;e Mona&s;teries of Nuns, is
call'd the <HI>Great Montier,</HI> or the greater Mo|na&s;tery;
and in this all the Nuns of the Quire,
that have a good Voice, and are in Health,
are Lodged. The Offices are very regularly
<PB N="178" REF="102">
Sung here at all Hours, and the Church is a
curious fair Building, to Perfection, Spacious
and Sumptuous. There are about a hundred
and fifty Nuns profe&s;t in it, who continue
there till they grow Old or Weak and Infirm,
for then they are di&s;charged of their Ob&s;er|vance,
and from the Service of the Quire,
and are remov'd to the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Mag|dalen,</HI>
which is de&s;tinated only for tho&s;e Nuns,
that are Old or Di&s;temper'd. They have no
other Obligation upon them, but to hear one
low Ma&s;s every day. Their Church al&s;o is a
very fair one, and they have very curious
Gardens. The Third Mona&s;tery of the&s;e
Religious Maids, is call'd the Novitiat, where
they have their Boarders and Novices. Here
they are taught what&s;oever they have a de&s;ire
to, <HI>viz.</HI> to Work, to Sing by Notes, to
Dance, to Play upon In&s;truments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
Fourth Mona&s;tery, which is for the Men, is
that of S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI> which contains
about Four&s;core or an Hundred Monks, tak|ing
in the Novices. Their Buildings and Cloi|&s;ters
are very Fair, but more e&s;pecially their
Library, and their Refectory. The Fifth
Mona&s;tery is that which is call'd the <HI>Secretene|rie,</HI>
and contains the Brothers Conver&s;es,
which are about Sixty in Number. They are
appointed for the Service of the Fathers,
when they are &s;ent to be Directors to other
Religious Hou&s;es of the &s;ame Order. All the&s;e
Five Mona&s;teries are extreamly well Built,
<PB N="179" REF="102">
have large Gardens, and their particular En|clo&s;ures;
but be&s;ides the&s;e, there is one great
Enclo&s;ure, which contains them all, and
makes a kind of City, Peopl'd with Monks
and Nuns. Without the grand Enclo&s;ure is
the Town of <HI>Fontevrault,</HI> Inhabited by all
&s;orts of Trades and Handicrafts-men, who gain
their Lively-hood by Working for the Abby,
and for the Strangers that come thither from
all Parts, either out of Curio&s;ity, or to Vi&s;it
&s;ome of their Kindred. This Order contains
about Three&s;core Abbies of Nuns, who all
own that of <HI>Fontevrault</HI> for their Mother, and
depend on it. The Abbe&s;s is General of the
Order; 'tis &s;he that performs the Vi&s;itation
of the Mona&s;teries, &s;ends them Directors
and Confe&s;&s;ors, and recals them at her Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time that ever I came to <HI>Fonte|vrault,</HI>
I was between Fifteen and Sixteen
years of Age, and it was at the Sollicitation
of my Aunt, who was a Nun there, and
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Novices, that I went thither.
Her de&s;ign was to per&s;uade me to become a&punc;
Monk of that Order, where &s;he had already
gain'd abundance of Credit. I found al&s;o
my two Uncles there, who were of very diffe|rent
Sentiments and Inclinations; for the one
of them, who was very well pleas'd with his
State of Obedience, endeavour'd, all he could,
to draw me into it; but the other, who had
a more noble Soul, talk'd to me of nothing
<PB N="180" REF="103">
el&s;e, but of the ba&s;ene&s;s and degeneracy of
Spirit there was, in making ones &s;elf a Slave
to Women. It is &s;ometimes permitted in
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to remove from one
Order to another, provided it be from one of
greater Liberty to a &s;tricter. Accordingly my
Uncle had done his utmo&s;t endeavour, to quit
the Order of <HI>Fontevrault,</HI> and to betake him|&s;elf
to that of the Reformed <HI>Benedictins</HI> of the
Congregation of S. <HI>Maur.</HI> But Madam <HI>de Bour|bon,</HI>
the la&s;t Prince&s;s of the Blood-Royal they
have had for their Lady Abbe&s;s, perceiving
that the be&s;t Subjects of her Order abandoned
it at la&s;t, by the natural &s;hame and regret
they had to obey Women, by this means took
a cour&s;e to &s;hut this Back-Door. She had &s;o
much Power, and &s;o many Friends in the Court
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;he knew &s;o well to repre&s;ent,
that this Change would not be allowed of in
Con&s;cience; fora&s;much as her Order, tho'
otherwi&s;e very mild and &s;lack, ought indeed,
(by rea&s;on of the blind Obedience which it
renders to the Inferior Sex) to be accounted
the mo&s;t mortifying and aba&s;ing of all others,
that are approved by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
that con&s;equently, according to the Canons it
could not be left, to go to another; That at la&s;t
&s;he obtain'd a Bull from <HI>Rome,</HI> which declar'd,
<HI>That after Profe&s;&s;ion, none ever after &s;hould be able
to quit the Order, to enter into another.</HI> But whe|ther
it were her Rank, and her Friends, or the
&s;trength of her Arguments that prevail'd in
<PB N="181" REF="103">
this ca&s;e, I will not determine. But by this
means all my Uncles de&s;igns were overthrown,
and he was forc'd by the Tenor of this Bull, to
continue in his fir&s;t Calling, tho' &s;ore again&s;t
his Will. He therefore did his utmo&s;t endea|vour
to deter me, from Entring my &s;elf a Reli|gious
there: And tho' I was but a Boy then,
I remember very well, that nothing was more
intolerable, than the Pride of the&s;e Nuns, who
(to exerci&s;e the Power they had of Command|ing)
made them do all manner of Indignities,
Follies, and infamous Services, even to that
degree, as to make them undre&s;s them&s;elves
Stark-naked before them in their Parlours, to
receive Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who are the &s;ubtil Foxes, that
creep in every where, where they have the
pro&s;pect of Profit and Advantage, had &s;o far
in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the Spirit of Madam
<HI>de Bourbon,</HI> that &s;he cho&s;e them for her Confe&s;aors,
and &s;ent for two of them to be always about
her, as her Directors. This was the greate&s;t
Affront that po&s;&s;ibly &s;he could have put upon
her own Monks, as if none among&s;t them all
had been able, or worthy to be her Spiritual
Father. In imitation of their Lady Abbe&s;s,
the other Nuns would needs have <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> for
their Confe&s;&s;ors too; &s;o that by this means,
the&s;e Fathers became very powerful at <HI>Fonte|vrault;</HI>
and to the end they might be the
more re&s;pected, they had the Addre&s;s to per|&s;uade
the Abbe&s;s, to command her Monks to
<PB N="182" REF="104">
obey them, and that the Obedience rendred to
them, &s;hould be look'd upon as paid to her &s;elf.
If there were a Petition to be pre&s;ented, an
Office to be be&s;towed, and in a word, any
Favour to be demanded, all was to pa&s;s through
the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> Hands. The Lady Abbe&s;s Sign'd
nothing, but what her Father Director had
fir&s;t approv'd of. It was they that had all the
good and dainty Bits, and who devour'd all
their Sweet-meats and Confects. This you
mu&s;t think was a very &s;en&s;ible Di&s;plea&s;ure to
the&s;e Monks, who thereupon began to grow
very lean. But by good hap for them, tho' mo&s;t
unhappily for the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> the Lady Abbe&s;s died;
and they had no &s;ooner clo&s;ed her Eyes, but
the <HI>Monks,</HI> in revenge of their Sufferings and
Di&s;graces, as one Man, fell upon the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI>
and after having La&s;ht them very bountifully,
turn'd them &s;hamefully out of the Mona&s;tery.
The Nuns might Cry their Hearts out from
their Parlours, commanding them to Treat the
Gentlemen civilly, and not to hurt them; the
Monks were re&s;olved not to hear them, &s;ince
the Authority of the Abbe&s;s was no longer
there to re&s;train them.</P>
<P>My Uncle gave me a full Account of all the
Particulars of it: But my other Uncle, on the
contrary, did his utmo&s;t endeavour to per&s;uade
me, to make one of them. He told me, That
their Obedience was not at all difficult to be
ob&s;erv'd; that the Abbe&s;s and the Nuns com|manded
them nothing, but &s;uch things as were
<PB N="183" REF="104">
&s;weet and ea&s;ie, and that there was nothing
of Rigour in all their Ob&s;ervance; that they
were not oblig'd to Ri&s;e at Night; and kept
no other Fa&s;ts, &s;ave tho&s;e of the Church; and
that after they had fini&s;hed their Studies, they
were all advanc'd to be the Directors and
Confe&s;&s;&s;ors of the Nuns of their Order, and
that then they were perfectly happy.</P>
<P>My Aunt, after this, &s;ent for me into the
Parlour; where, after that &s;he had made me
take part of a Collation, &s;he told me a thou|&s;and
pretty things, to engage me to be one of
them. I took occa&s;ion to object to her, what
her Elder Brother had told me, about their
giving Di&s;cipline to Men: She de&s;ired me, by
no means to give ear to him, as being a di&s;|contented
Per&s;on, and enrag'd, becau&s;e he
could not effect his De&s;igns: Yet &s;he could not
deny that &s;uch things pa&s;t among&s;t them, but
that it was only upon young Novices, and
tho&s;e that were newly profe&s;t, until they had
accompli&s;h'd their Studies; that is to &s;ay, till
the Age of 25 Years. And fora&s;much as the&s;e
were the very Stages, that I was to pa&s;s
through, in ca&s;e I re&s;olved to &s;tay with them,
&s;he told me, to &s;often the matter, and the
better to prepare me for it, That it was not
&s;o har&s;h a thing, as probably I might imagin;
that all the Nuns of <HI>Fontevrault</HI> were Ladies
of Quality, and that it was a far greater Di&s;|grace,
to receive Di&s;cipline from the hands of
a Monk, who often is no better than the Son
<PB N="184" REF="105">
of a Porter, or Cobler, than from them; and
be&s;ides, that this never hapned, but upon very
extraordinary Occa&s;ions, to try their Obedi|ence.
In a word, &s;he told me, That all this
was accounted as nothing among&s;t them, as
being accu&s;tom'd to &s;uch matters. However,
all the&s;e Rea&s;ons were not capable of &s;ati&s;|fying
me, and I was oblig'd to cut &s;hort, and
tell her, That I felt no Call to the Religious
State, of what Order &s;oever it might be; and
if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to give me one here|after,
he was to be Ma&s;ter, and that then I
would apply my &s;elf, with all my power to
follow it: And &s;o de&s;ired her, to talk to me
no more about it.</P>
<P>I &s;taid about Three Weeks with my Uncles
in the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Johns,</HI> and I ate always
at the Prior's Table in the Hall, where they
entertain their Strangers. A young Gentle|man,
who came thither the &s;ame Day as I did,
only Supt there the Evening after our Arrival;
after which time, becau&s;e he was come with
the de&s;ign of Entring him&s;elf into their Order,
they made him Eat in the common Refectory,
together with the other Novices and Monks;
and Eight days after, they gave him the Habit.
The Ma&s;ter of the Novices being come one
Day to the Table for Strangers, where I was,
the Prior asked him, How the young Novice
behaved him&s;elf; who an&s;wered him, That he
did Wonders, and gave the marks of an extra|ordinary
Fervor. Among&s;t other things, I
<PB N="185" REF="105">
remember he &s;aid, That <HI>He alone had almost
&s;wept the whole Dormitory that Morning, and
that the Nune had already once called him into the
Parlour, from whence he return'd more joyful than
he went thither.</HI> The Monks that were there
Smil'd upon one another, and conceiv'd good
hopes, that he would per&s;evere, &s;eeing he had
made &s;o good a beginning, and &s;o well taken
his fir&s;t Trial.</P>
<P>I had a great de&s;ire to go and &s;ee the
Monks Dine in the Common Refectory; but
they told me, I mu&s;t &s;tay till next <HI>Sunday,</HI> for
that it was not permitted to be there any other
Day of the Week, becau&s;e of the Trials they
made of the Novices. My Uncle informed
me what the&s;e Trials were, <HI>viz.</HI> to make &s;ome
of them to carry a piece of Wood, or Gag in
their Mouths; others were commanded, to go
and ki&s;s the Monks Shoes; others, to continue
upon their Knees, with their Arms acro&s;s;
others again, to eat their Meals on the Ground,
without either Table-Cloth or Napkin, and an
hundred other &s;uch like Fooleries. The highe&s;t
Trial of all, is the Di&s;cipline, and they ob&s;erve
a Na&s;ty manner in the giving of it; for where|as
in all other Religious Orders, they ordina|rily
give it on their Shoulders, at <HI>Fontevrault</HI>
they always give it beneath. It was not long
&s;ince, that two Novices went to complain to
the Abbe&s;s, That the Prior handled them with
too great Severity; but the Abbe&s;s having
made them come into her Chamber, gave them
<PB N="186" REF="106">
as much more, to make them forbear their
Complaints to another. 'Tis in the&s;e Fooleries
they make Vertue to con&s;i&s;t, and they never
teach their Religious, what it is to be Vertuous
indeed, <HI>viz.</HI> to mortifie, as they ought, their
Appetites, and to be meek and lowly of Heart.
This is that which makes the&s;e Young Men,
when they are pa&s;t their Novitiate, and have
run through the Cour&s;e of their Studies, to
have their Pa&s;&s;ions as head-&s;trong as ever, and
to lead a &s;candalous Life with the Nuns, who&s;e
Directors they are.</P>
<P>The&s;e Nuns have a great deal more Liberty
allow'd them, than tho&s;e of other Orders;
their Grates are very &s;pacious, and are not
double, as in <HI>Italy:</HI> They have the freedom to
enter into their Outward Churches, and Out|ward
Parlours, which is not permitted to other
Nuns, and with leave from the Abbe&s;s they
may go abroad too. They will have all the
Publick Exerci&s;es of Learning to be performed
in their Pre&s;ence, as all Latin Declamations
and Di&s;putations. They have to this purpo&s;e
a very great Hall, which is call'd the <HI>Di&s;putation-Hall,</HI>
and is of a great length and breadth,
having the Partition of a curious Iron-Grate
in the mid&s;t of it, all Gilt, the one half being
a&s;&s;ign'd to the Nuns, and the other to the Fa|thers,
who maintain the Di&s;pute. There are
a great many Nuns among&s;t them, who do
very well under&s;tand Latin, yea, and, Philo|&s;ophy
too. It &s;eems, that being to Command
<PB N="187" REF="106">
Men, they thought it fitting to take upon them
this Manly quality.</P>
<P>In a Second Journy, which I took about
Twelve years ago to <HI>Fontevrault,</HI> I heard &s;ome
Nuns Di&s;puting very prettily upon &s;ome Meta|phy&s;ical
Points. They had conceiv'd a de&s;ign
of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Study of the Liberal Arts
among&s;t them&s;elves; and indeed being the &s;ole
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es there, they might do in it what&s;oever
they pleas'd. They &s;aid, <HI>They would give the
World a &s;en&s;ible demonstration, That it is a great
piece of Inju&s;tice done to the Sex, not to &s;uffer
them to Study, only to keep them the more in Sub|jection
and Error.</HI> As for what concerns Piety
and Devotion, the&s;e Nuns &s;hew they have
but little of it, their whole Conver&s;ation
being extreamly Worldy and La&s;civious, as
well as their Dre&s;s and Habit. They are
cloath'd in white, and wear a black Veil over
it: When they appear in the Quire, they wear
a great black Frock. The Monks wear a black
Ca&s;&s;ock, and a Hood, and when they go to
Church they al&s;o put on a black Frock.</P>
<P>This is what I had to communicate to you
concerning this Religious Order, tho' not all
that I could &s;ay concerning them. It was to
great purpo&s;e indeed, that S. <HI>Paul</HI> affirms Man
to be the Head of the Woman, and that there|fore
&s;he ought to be &s;ubject and obedient to
him; &s;eeing the Popes, who boa&s;t them&s;elves to
be many degrees above S. <HI>Paul,</HI> have deci&s;ively
<PB N="188" REF="107">
declared on this occa&s;ion, that the Woman is
the Head of the Man, and who upon this ac|count
is bound to yield Obedience to her. I
remember to have read in an Engli&s;h Author,
that formerly there were &s;uch like Abbies
in <HI>England,</HI> where the Women u&s;urp'd Autho|rity
over the Men. He mentions (among&s;t
others) the Abby of <HI>Repandune,</HI> and that of
<HI>Strene&s;haleh,</HI> where the Abbe&s;&s;es commanded
the Monks and Nuns, that were in the &s;ame
Mona&s;tery. But fora&s;much as this Author doth
affect throughout all his Di&s;cour&s;e, to oppo&s;e
him&s;elf to the <HI>Benedictins,</HI> who fir&s;t brought
the Mona&s;tick Life along with them into this
I&s;land, and that he racks his Brain to prove,
without any ground of Rea&s;on, That <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>
of <HI>Arimathea</HI> (he who Buried our Lord Je&s;us)
came and Founded &s;everal Mona&s;teries here,
Thirty years after the Death of our Saviour,
only to rob them of the glory, of having been
the fir&s;t Founders; there is rea&s;on al&s;o to reject
what he &s;aith concerning the&s;e Abbies, which
he pretends to be much more Ancient, than the
Arrival of S. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that there were
Communities of Religious Per&s;ons in the Pri|mitive
Church, &s;eeing the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves,
for &s;ome time lived in Common, and the Be|lievers
of both Sexes at that time, in imitation
of them, and by the nece&s;&s;ity there was of
their being In&s;tructed in the Faith and Duties
of Chri&s;tianity; as likewi&s;e, that they might
<PB N="189" REF="107">
be in a better condition to provide for their
Poor, lived Charitably together, and in the
con&s;tant practice of all Religious Duties.
Wherefore it may be, that in this &s;en&s;e, and
after this manner, there may have been at the
fir&s;t Preaching of the Go&s;pel in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome
of the&s;e kind of Communities, which were no
more than the fir&s;t Converts, who lived toge|ther
for the better convenience of being In|&s;tructed,
to the end they might be in a condi|tion
afterwards of In&s;tructing others. I &s;peak
now according to the Opinion of tho&s;e, who
will have it, that the Go&s;pel was Preached
in <HI>England,</HI> in the Apo&s;tles time, and by the
Apo&s;tles them&s;elves; for according to the Sen|timent
of others, who maintain, that S. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>
was the fir&s;t that Preached the Go&s;pel in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
it is not improbable, but that he Founded
Mona&s;teries here after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, as
being a Monk him&s;elf. But the&s;e <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Mo|na&s;teries,
are very different from tho&s;e Reli|gious
Communities of the Primitive Church,
which were only In&s;tituted for the Publick
Good, whereas the&s;e &s;eem only to eye a Parti|cular
Good, and to have abandon'd all the
Duties of Chri&s;tian Charity towards their
Neighbour, for to live only to them&s;elves; and
are in fine become to that degree the Scandal
of Chri&s;tianity, that they are even a&s;ham'd of
their own Names. Let any Man go in <HI>France,</HI>
and de&s;ire to &s;peak with a Monk or Nun, or
let him addre&s;s a Letter to them with this
<PB N="190" REF="108">
Super&s;cription, and they will find them more
offended at it, than if one had call'd them

<P><HI>There remains nothing for me at pre&s;ent,

Bu&s;ine&s;s in my <HI>Italian</HI> Journies, to di&s;cover and
examine the Defects of tho&s;e Females that live in
Monasteries, and who have here given a very
plain de&s;cription of them; whether, I &s;ay, I would
by this &s;eem to aver in Truth and Con&s;cience, that
generally all of them are in this &s;tate of Corrup|tion,
Malice, Sen&s;uality, and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, whereof
I have &s;poken?</P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer, That I have not yet
made mention of another exce&s;s of Bigotry,
Super&s;tition, Illu&s;ion and Folly, which predo|minates
in a great number of Convents of
Nuns, and always in &s;ome one Nun or other,
even in tho&s;e Mona&s;teries that are the mo&s;t
Corrupt and Licentious. Their Devotion con|&s;i&s;ts,
it may be, in Kneeling before &s;ome little
Saint of Wood they have in &s;ome Corner of
their Mona&s;tery, and to continue there in that
po&s;ture two or three Hours together every
day. Another undertakes to mumble over
daily a dozen <HI>Ro&s;aries</HI> for the Souls in Purga|tory;
and if any Si&s;ter come to &s;peak with her
during that time, &s;he affects to turn a deaf Ear
to her, for fear of interrupting her Prayers.
Another will go to the Middle of the Choir,
<PB N="191" REF="108">
and there lie pro&s;trate upon the Ground, for a
long time together before the Holy Sacrament,
beat her Brea&s;t, &s;tretch forth her Arms cro&s;s|wi&s;e,
pu&s;h forth great Sighs, and &s;tare with
her Eyes, as if &s;he were ravi&s;hed and tran&s;|ported
in an Ex&s;ta&s;ie. Others undertake to
live on nothing but the Ho&s;t, which they
receive at the Communion, for two or three
Days, during which time they ab&s;tain from all
manner of Meat, and by this means reduce
them&s;elves to a pitiful condition. If any one
demands of them, why they pretend to do &s;o,
they will tell you, that <HI>it is in hopes of becoming
Saints,</HI> and that this is their highe&s;t Ambition.
The&s;e poor Nuns have their Brains fill'd with
tho&s;e mi&s;erable Legends of the Lives of Saints,
wherewith their Ears ring continually, and
where a great number of &s;uch like Actions are
related, for their mo&s;t tran&s;cendent Vertues.
And accordingly they believe, that by doing the
&s;ame they &s;hall become Saints likewi&s;e; and
there is more of a Worldly Ambition in the
ca&s;e than is commonly thought of, to acquire
Reputation in a Church, where after Death
they place the Per&s;ons, that practi&s;e the&s;e kind
of Follies upon their Altars, in order to wor&s;hip
them.</P>
<P><HI>It is not unlikely, but that a Nun may po&s;|&s;ibly
fill her Head with &s;uch Imaginations as
the&s;e;</HI> Go to, after that I have been frequent and
a&s;&s;iduous in the&s;e Actions, from whence the mea|&s;ures
of Holine&s;s and Saint&s;hip are commonly taken,
<PB N="192" REF="109">
when once I am dead, they will make me a
Sainte&s;s, they'l cau&s;e a Head of Silver to be made,
in which they will encha&s;e mine, they will en&s;hrine
my Body, every one will &s;trive to get a little bit
of my Skin, to di&s;po&s;e of it among&s;t their Relicks;
the Sisters will carry me on their Shoulders in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion,
and come and Kneel before my Relicks, to
Pray to me, as we do to &s;uch and &s;uch a Sainte&s;s.
O, the Glory and Honour there is in being a Saint!
My greatest Ambition is to be one of them. <HI>With|out
doubt, there be many Nuns in</HI> Italy <HI>that
give way to &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e, and tho&s;e
who have not the Talent of the World, do
incline to this Spiritual Ambition. They be|come
in&s;upportable in their Convents to their
Si&s;ters them&s;elves, and one may ea&s;ily perceive
in all their Actions a mo&s;t devili&s;h Pride.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the other &s;ort of Nuns I have
taken notice of, and of who&s;e Temper and
Actions I have had occa&s;ion fully and per|fectly
to be inform'd. But yet I will not be
&s;o rigid, as to &s;ay that among&s;t &s;o great a
number of Nuns, there &s;hould not be &s;ometime
found &s;ome good Soul, who with a right and
&s;incere Heart goes purely and &s;imply to God;
tho' indeed never any one came to my know|ledge,
for whom I could pa&s;s my word, as
far as mortal Men, who do not &s;ee the bottom
of the Heart, can do, for the Hone&s;ty of one
another; but yet I am willing to believe, that
there are &s;ome found among&s;t them that are
Good indeed, and exempt from tho&s;e great
<PB N="193" REF="109">
Weakne&s;&s;es that are found in the two Ex|treams,
in like manner as we find &s;ome white
Crows here in <HI>England.</HI> But and if there
&s;hould be a greater number of the&s;e, yet
would not this enervate my Conclu&s;ion, which
is this, <HI>That when a State or Condition hath been
erected, in the hopes of attaining a greater Good;
if afterwards it be found, that contrary to the
good hope that has been conceived, it produceth a
great Evil; tho' it may be true al&s;o, that it is not
without good effect upon &s;ome, yet tho&s;e who are in
Power are obliged in Con&s;cience to abrogate it;</HI>
Which is that the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath
done, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Mona&s;teries of Men
and Women, wherewith the Country was &s;o
mi&s;erably pe&s;ter'd: For which GOD be

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Fourth Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>WE departed from <HI>Fondi</HI> early in the
Morning, with de&s;ign to reach <HI>Ca|pua</HI>
that day. The Night before
they had told us many Stories of <HI>Banditi,</HI> who
not contenting them&s;elves to Rob the Pa&s;&s;en|gers
they met with, mo&s;t frequently took
them Pri&s;oners along with them, and Sold
<PB N="195" REF="110">
them to the <HI>Turks,</HI> or the fir&s;t Pirates they
met with, for Slaves. The&s;e <HI>Banditi</HI> Swarm
in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> into which we
were entr'd the day before; for <HI>Fondi,</HI> is a
Town belonging to that Kingdom. We were
extreamly affrighted, after that we had Rode
Three or Four Miles, to &s;ee Four Men com|ing
&s;trait towards us, cro&s;s a Field, as if they
had a mind to intercept us. The only thing
encourag'd us was, that we &s;aw no Arms
about them: But we &s;oon recover'd of our
Fears, when in&s;tead of advancing nearer to
us, we &s;aw them kneel down, crying aloud
to us, that we would be pleas'd to give them
our Ble&s;&s;ing, for they had perceiv'd by our
Habit that we were Prie&s;ts; we immediately
di&s;patch'd them a great Sign of the Cro&s;s,
whereupon they return'd to their Labour. Be|ing
gone a little further, we &s;aw many others
come, who de&s;ir'd the &s;ame favour. Some
of them approach'd nearer to us, and endea|vour'd
to ki&s;s our Boots, or touch our Habits
with their Hands, and afterwards ki&s;s'd the
parts of their Hands wherewith they had
touch'd them. We were not much in Love
with the&s;e kind of Ceremonies, as having
the <HI>Banditi</HI> always in our minds. However,
we began at la&s;t to be accu&s;tom'd to it, and
admir'd the Super&s;tition and &s;implicity of
the&s;e poor People, whom their Prie&s;ts have
well nigh per&s;uaded to adore them.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="111">
I have already in &s;everal Places made
mention of the Super&s;tition of the <HI>Italians;</HI> but
there is none to be compar'd with that,
which Reigns in the Parts, that are &s;ubject
to the Dominion of <HI>Spain.</HI> And I &s;uppo&s;e
the rea&s;on why the Prie&s;ts command more
re&s;pect there is, becau&s;e by their frequent
Conver&s;ing with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they have ac|cu&s;tom'd
them&s;elves to an air of Gravity,
that makes them very Venerable, and have
taken to them&s;elves Proud and Lofty Titles,
affecting to be call'd Gentlemen and Knights
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which probably may contri|bute
much to impre&s;s this great re&s;pect upon
the Spirits of the common People.</P>
<P>Generally throughout all <HI>Italy,</HI> the Prie&s;ts
are Ma&s;ters, and con&s;equently are Fear'd, but
(&s;etting a&s;ide their Character, which they
have a re&s;pect for,) not e&s;teem'd or re&s;pected.
Yea, there are &s;ome Parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> where they
have &s;carcely any re&s;pect &s;hew'd them at all.
The <HI>Venetians</HI> make a di&s;tinction between a
Prie&s;t at the Altar, Array'd in his Pontifical
Habit, when he &s;aith, or is about to &s;ay Ma&s;s;
and a Prie&s;t in Worldly Commerce and Con|ver&s;e.
Under the fir&s;t Con&s;ideration, they
be&s;tow the &s;ame Adorations upon him, as up|on
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e Per&s;on, they &s;ay, he
Repre&s;ents; they approach them to touch
and ki&s;s their Habit, or their Foot&s;teps, as
they return from the Altar, and fall upon
their Knees to receive their Benediction. But
<PB N="197" REF="111">
as &s;oon as they have undre&s;t them&s;elves, and
are come out of the Ve&s;try, they do not &s;o
much as Salute them, or give them the lea&s;t
Preference. The mo&s;t part of the Nobility
of <HI>Venice,</HI> have a Prie&s;t in their Hou&s;es, for
their Chaplains, or to be the Governours of
their Children; but they u&s;e them with the
greate&s;t Indignity, they make them to Dine
with their Servants, and u&s;e them as &s;uch;
for they Command them as the meane&s;t Ser|vant,
and make them run up and down on
Errands like Foot-Boys; with a Come hither
Prie&s;t, Go thither Prie&s;t; indeed it is a very
&s;hame, to &s;ee how they talk to their Prie&s;ts;
and they have certainly more re&s;pect for their
Gondoliers or Bargemen, than for them.
When a Prie&s;t accompanies the Children,
who&s;e Governour he is, along the Streets,
they will not &s;uffer him to go be&s;ides with
them, but will have them follow them, as
their Lackey; and if the Children go to Vi|&s;it
&s;ome other Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> they are call'd
to come up, to the Dining Room, and the
poor Prie&s;t mu&s;t &s;tay below at the Gate with
the Servants. And in truth, they make u&s;e
of them purely for Foot-Boys; for if they
had no Prie&s;ts to accompany their Children,
they would be oblig'd to keep Foot-Boys, or
&s;ome Servants or other to do it, and yet they
give them no Salary neither. 'Tis the Prie&s;t
that co&s;ts them le&s;s than any other of their
Dome&s;ticks, for he has never a Farthing of Wa|ges,
<PB N="198" REF="112">
and for his Diet, he is fain to take it
with the Servants, and Gondoliers, as was
mention'd before. All the advantage he has,
is this, that they give him leave every Mor|ning,
to go and &s;ay Ma&s;s in &s;ome Church or
other, and the Mony he gains thereby, is for
him&s;elf, and &s;erves to maintain him in Clothes.
But as much as the Prie&s;ts are kept under, and
undervalu'd in outward Conver&s;e among&s;t the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> &s;o much are they Honour'd and
Re&s;pected in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> the
Title of <HI>Cavalier di Chri&s;to,</HI> Knight of Chri&s;t,
gives them entrance to, and acceptance with
the be&s;t of Companies, and among&s;t the
greate&s;t Lords. Not only at the Altar, but
where&s;oever they meet them, they account
it, not only Honourable, but Meritorious, to
touch and ki&s;s their Ca&s;&s;ocks, as tho&s;e poor
Country Men did, who quitted their Plows,
and came a great way to ki&s;s our Boots.</P>
<P>We came to <HI>Mola,</HI> which is a &s;mall Town
upon the Sea Shoar, and from whence we
may &s;ee <HI>Gaeta.</HI> I will not in&s;i&s;t here to give
you a Relation of <HI>Cicero's</HI> Gardens, of the
<HI>Via Appia,</HI> or of tho&s;e other Curio&s;ities which
we meet with in the&s;e Quarters, and whereof
the World is &s;ufficiently inform'd, by tho&s;e
many Books of Travels, that have handled
them on purpo&s;e, and al&s;o becau&s;e it condu|ceth
nothing to my pre&s;ent De&s;ign. I &s;hall
only here pre&s;ent you with a pretty odd Spe|ctacle
which pre&s;ented it &s;elf to our Eyes at
<PB N="199" REF="112">
<HI>Mola.</HI> We &s;aw a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Souldier, who had
a great Pur&s;e in his Hand, and a Prie&s;t that
followed him, they went from Hou&s;e to
Hou&s;e, and from Shop to Shop. The Soul|dier
acco&s;ted us in a manner, very Cavalier
like, and which &s;poke him to be what he was.
Gentlemen, &s;aid he, put &s;ome pieces of Mony
into my Pur&s;e, that this Knight of Chri&s;t here
may &s;ay Ma&s;s. My Companion gave him
&s;omewhat a rude An&s;wer. How &s;o, &s;aid he,
do I hinder him from &s;aying Ma&s;s? It is not
enough, repli'd the Souldier, that you do not
hinder him, you mu&s;t help and a&s;&s;i&s;t him;
and taking him by his Cloak, he &s;aid, a&s;&s;ure
your &s;elf, that I will not let you go, till you
have given me &s;omething; &s;o that he was fain
to put his Hand into his Pocket and content
him. The Prie&s;t who was likewi&s;e a <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
kept him&s;elf always behind the Souldier, with
his great flat Hat upon his Head, and with all
the Gravity of a Prelate, he neither looked
upon, nor Saluted any one, but March'd
along continually muttering in his Breviary:
Which made my Companion, after that he
had put &s;ome Mony into the Pur&s;e, to &s;ay,
methinks he might at lea&s;t thank tho&s;e, that
give &s;omething. But the Souldier, an&s;wered
for him; What? would you have him to
take notice of Men, whil&s;t he is &s;peaking to
God? The an&s;wer I confe&s;s was excellent for
a Souldier: Tho' indeed it was but too evi|dent,
that it was nothing but Pride, which
<PB N="200" REF="113">
put this Prie&s;t upon &s;aying his Office, after
this manner publickly in the Streets, as if he
could not have found any other place or time
for the performance of that Duty. But I
have ob&s;erv'd, that the mo&s;t part of the
Clergy of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;eldom put them&s;elves upon
&s;aying their Office, but when and where they
may be &s;een. There are &s;ome of them, who
make them&s;elves in&s;upportable, and who to
exempt them&s;elves from the Duties of Civil
Society, betake them&s;elves to their Breviary,
when any one &s;tands in need of them. One
might well tell them, what an hone&s;t Man,
who had bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;poke upon occa|&s;ion
of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Judge, before whom
his Cau&s;e was to be Pleaded. Every time he
went to &s;peak with him, this Judge, who
had already been Brib'd by his Adver&s;e Party,
to avoid the Hearing of his Rea&s;ons, took
upon him always to Read his Breviary, when
ever he came to &s;peak with him, and his Ser|vants
gave him no other an&s;wer, but this,
that their Ma&s;ter was &s;aying his Office: <HI>Dice
al &s;uo Officio.</HI> At la&s;t this Hone&s;t Man being
weary of hearing continually the &s;ame an|&s;wer,
told them: <HI>Dice l' Officio? quanto
Sarebbe meglio che lo face&s;&s;e. Saith his Office:</HI>
(quoth he?) <HI>How much better would it be
to do it?</HI> In like manner this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t
would, as it &s;eems to me have done much
better, either to have taken his time early
in the Morning, to have &s;aid his Breviary
<PB N="201" REF="113">
or to have deferr'd it to &s;ome other time more
convenient, that he might have been in a
condition to have thank'd the Per&s;ons, that
be&s;tow'd their Charity upon him?</P>
<P>They told us, That the Souldiers in tho&s;e
Parts did render this kind Office to all poor
Stranger Prie&s;ts, who could not meet with any
that would pay them for their Ma&s;s, to excu&s;e
them from the trouble of Begging them&s;elves.
As for the other Prie&s;ts of the Country, they
are &s;ure to meet with their Pay in their
Churches. The&s;e Souldiers &s;ometimes gather
a great deal more, than is nece&s;&s;ary for to &s;ay
a Ma&s;s; but for all that, they very hone&s;tly
give all to the poor Prie&s;ts, for whom they
have Collected it, without being willing to re|ceive
one Farthing of it for their pains, not|with&s;tanding
that frequently they are a Com|pany
of mi&s;erable Wretches, that are ready to
&s;tarve; in which ca&s;e I have often admired
their extraordinary Piety, in point-blank con|tradiction
to the common Proverb; <HI>Nulla Fides
Pieta&s;que viris qui ca&s;tra &s;equuntur.</HI> They are
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Souldiers who do this, and not the
<HI>Italian,</HI> nor the Natives of the Kingdom of
<HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>After having refre&s;h'd our &s;elves at <HI>Mola,</HI>
we went to <HI>Caieta,</HI> which lies on one &s;ide of it,
and from thence went on Foot, to take a view
of the Rock, which they &s;ay was rent a&s;under
at the Death of our Saviour, when the Rocks
were cleft, and the Graves were opened.
<PB N="202" REF="114">
We a&s;cended, winding round the Mountain,
which is on the back&s;ide of <HI>Caieta;</HI> and indeed
a part of the City is built upon the Side, of
that height, where it forms a fair Amphi|theater.
They have taken care to make the
Way, that leads up to the Cleft of the Rock,
very ea&s;ie; I can't well &s;ay, whether it was
half a mile, or a quarter of a mile that we
mounted; but we had no rea&s;on to repent of
the Pains we had taken, for certainly it is one
of the mo&s;t Lovely Places, and greate&s;t Curio|&s;ities
that can be &s;een. This Rock forms a
Cape, which runs out a great way into the Sea,
and is &s;plit from the Top to the Bottom by the
mid&s;t, and the two halves of the Rock are
di&s;tant from each other the length of about a
Perch, or a Perch and an half. Being on the
Top, we &s;ee the Waves of the Sea that pa&s;s
under the Rock, and beating again&s;t the Stones
make a dreadful Noi&s;e. A great Stone being
loo&s;ned from the upper part of the Rock, fell
down with that exactne&s;s, that it &s;tuck fa&s;t
between the Cleft in the lowermo&s;t part of it,
which is pretty near the Water, and it was
found large enough, and firmly fix'd to build
a Chapel upon it. The Papi&s;ts make a Mi|racle
of this, and tell us, <HI>That a Holy Hermit,
who dwelt upon this Mountain, and who almo&s;t
continually meditated upon the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Sa|viour,
near to the Cleft of the Rock, pray'd on a
time very earne&s;tly to God, That it would plea&s;e
him &s;o to di&s;po&s;e of things, that a Chapel might
<PB N="203" REF="114">
be built in this place, which had expre&s;t &s;ome kind of
Sen&s;ibility at the Sufferings of his Son, our Lord
Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, by the
Divine Power, this Stone was loo&s;ned from its
place, and fell down and fixed it &s;elf in the place,
where he had de&s;ired to have a Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks have been &s;o often
convinc'd of Fal&s;ene&s;s, in regard of the Mi|racles
they attribute to them&s;elves, that we have
rea&s;on to doubt of all tho&s;e they have a mind
to make us believe. This Stone, and this
Chapel, in the condition they are at pre&s;ent,
&s;hew nothing that looks Miraculous; both the
one and the other re&s;t upon very good Foun|dations;
and if a Miracle was wrought in
loo&s;ning it from the re&s;t of the Rock, and
placing it where it is, this is that which is in
que&s;tion; and as we cannot prove the con|trary,
&s;o neither can they, what they a&s;&s;ert.
The Matter of certain Truth is only this, That
there is a Chapel there, and a very fair de|&s;cent
leading to it. If Men feel Devotion,
when they go down thither meditating on the
Pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour, as a certain Traveller
in the Relation he has given us of his Travels
doth a&s;&s;ure us, it is the Meditation it &s;elf that
will afford and excite that at all times, and in
all places, where it is done with a well-prepared
Heart and Mind. The Chapel is &s;pacious
enough, and very neat, and there are Windows
that look out on both &s;ides, by which one may
take a view of this great Cleft very exactly;
<PB N="204" REF="115">
and certainly, it is a Sight that frights Nature,
e&s;pecially when one looks down into the Sea.
Whil&s;t we were here we &s;aw a Sea-Mon&s;ter,
which, as it were in a moment, plung'd it
&s;elf again into the Sea, not giving me leave to
view it &s;o well, as to give you a de&s;cription of
it. The Popes have granted Indulgences to
tho&s;e who go and vi&s;it this Place; and at cer|tain
times of the Year, more e&s;pecially in <HI>Lent,</HI>
they come in Pilgrimage thither from all
Parts.</P>
<P><HI>After that we had &s;atisfied our Curio&s;ity, we
remounted again by the &s;ame Steps, and we
went to &s;ee &s;ome Hermits, who abide upon
the Mountain, and are Lodged very neatly.
The Gentleman that Travell'd with me, ha|ving
pre&s;ented them with a Paper of</HI> Bononia
<HI>Snu&s;h-Tobacco, which without doubt is one of
the greate&s;t Pre&s;ents that can be made to</HI> Italians;
<HI>they Invited us to &s;tay and Dine with them, and
&s;eeing that they were well provided with Fle&s;h
and Fi&s;h, we accepted the Invitation. They
told us,</HI> That tho' they were poor, and lived only
upon Alms, yet, ble&s;&s;ed be God, they wanted nothing.
<HI>There was one of the&s;e Hermits that was a
Prie&s;t, and who went every day to &s;ay Ma&s;s
in the Miraculous Chapel. Tho&s;e of them
that are Prie&s;ts, they call</HI> Fathers, <HI>and tho&s;e
that are not,</HI> Brothers. <HI>The Father Hermit kept
Company with us, to entertain us with Di&s;|cour&s;e,
whil&s;t the Brothers gave Order about
Dinner. He told us,</HI> That he had not been an
<PB N="205" REF="115">
Hermit above Three years, and that he was a
Secular Prie&s;t before he turn'd Hermit: That the
Hermit, his Predece&s;&s;or died very Aged, and with
an odour of Sanctity; but that about a year after
his Death, they had found a great deal of Silver
hid in an Old Pallet-Bed, on which he lay, tho'
it was not permitted to them to po&s;&s;e&s;s one Far|thing,
and that this had much le&s;&s;ened the good
Opinion they had conceived of him, neither was it
known how po&s;&s;ibly he could gather all that Mony.
<HI>This Hermit entertain'd us with good and
witty Di&s;cour&s;e, and had &s;een the World in
his time. He had Travell'd in</HI> France <HI>and</HI>
Germany, <HI>before that he was an Hermit. He
&s;eem'd to be of a plain, open, and free Spirit,
and quite different from the ordinary Temper
of the Monks and</HI> Frati <HI>of</HI> Italy; <HI>whence the</HI>
Capucins <HI>al&s;o had taken occa&s;ion to Accu&s;e him
before the Bi&s;hop of</HI> Caieta, <HI>that he was not of
an Hermetick Spirit, with intent of thru&s;ting
him out of that Place, and putting in them|&s;elves,
but fail'd of their de&s;ign. I formerly
was not unacquainted of the</HI> Capucins, <HI>being
irreconcilable Enemies to the</HI> Hermits, <HI>becau&s;e
of the re&s;emblance of their Habits, and of
their &s;ame way of Sub&s;i&s;tence, which is Alms;</HI>
Figulus odit Figulum; Two of a Trade &s;eldom
love one another. <HI>But this Hermit, it &s;eems,
had kept his Station in &s;pite of all their Efforts,
and had &s;o far gain'd the Spirit of the Poor by
his Alms, of the Common People by his Fami|liarity,
and that of the Great Ones by his
<PB N="206" REF="116">
unaffected Air, and plea&s;ant Comportment,
that they de&s;pair'd of ever gaining their End
upon him. He told me,</HI> That they gave Meat
every Day to above Forty poor People. <HI>I de&s;ired
him to tell me, how it was po&s;&s;ible for them to
do &s;o, &s;ince they liv'd upon nothing but Cha|rity
them&s;elves? He reply'd,</HI> That they had
mnch more bestowed upon them than they could
&s;pend; that every Morning they had two A&s;&s;es &s;ent
to them loaden with Provi&s;ions, and that be&s;ides
this, he went every Evening to demand a Charity
at all the Gentlemens Hou&s;es where he was known;
that when he came there, they led him into their
Cellars where their be&s;t Wine was, and afterwards
into their Butteries, &s;aying to him, <HI>Hermit, if there
be any thing here you like, pray take what
plea&s;eth you be&s;t.</HI> Here it is <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> that I and my
Companion do fill our Knap&s;acks. When we have a
mind to have &s;ome Fi&s;h, we go in the Evening to the
Haven where the Fi&s;her-Boats come, and they give
us abundantly, and that too which is very good, as
you will find by what you &s;hall have for your
Dinner. But on the other hand, al&s;o the&s;e Per&s;ons
&s;ome time or other return the Vi&s;it to us, and we
entertain them with the Be&s;t that we have. We
are not at all Covetous of that which cost us
nothing, and indeed this is the way for us to have
&s;till more; for, by this means, the&s;e Per&s;ons do not
know how to make us good Chear enough when
we come to them again. The <HI>Capucins (&s;aid he)</HI>
do not take this method, they are in&s;atiable, and
have a Temporal Father (as they call him) to
<PB N="207" REF="116">
whom they &s;end the Surplus of their Alms, and who
turns it into Mony, to Buy for them what&s;oever
they de&s;ire. They touch no Mony, nor buy any
thing; but he toucheth it, and buys it for them.
If they give &s;ome bits of Bread to the Poor at
their Gate, they are only &s;ome Scraps of the
Browne&s;t, which they could not &s;ell. But as for us,
we be&s;tow upon them indifferently of all we have;
this is that which hath procur'd us the Affection
of the Poor, and to that degree, that they would
certainly &s;acrifice their Lives for us, rather than
to &s;uffer the Hermitage to be taken out of our
hands.</P>
<P>This good Hermit, after having di&s;cours'd
thus a good while again&s;t the <HI>Capucins,</HI> order'd
Dinner to be brought up, which indeed was
Order'd and Dre&s;t very hand&s;omly, tho' in
Wooden Di&s;hes. My Companion would eat
no Pottage, becau&s;e they had no other, but
Wooden Spoons. This made the Hermits to
laugh heartily. They asked one another, where
they might get a Silver Spoon for this Gentle|man?
This was a young Prie&s;t, who never
had Travell'd, and who had always been
brought up in his Father's Hou&s;e: But at la&s;t,
&s;eeing that the Pul&s;e look'd very well, he ven|tur'd
to ta&s;te of them, and finding them ex|treamly
well dre&s;t and &s;ea&s;on'd, <HI>Well,</HI> (&s;aid he)
<HI>I don't matter a Spoon now, I &s;hall make a &s;hift
good enough, to eat them with my Fingers.</HI> The
<HI>Hermits</HI> and <HI>Capucins</HI> have the gift of Dre&s;|&s;ing
Meat perfectly well, and it &s;eems, as if
<PB N="208" REF="117">
they made it part of their Study: Neither
would I have any one to take an e&s;timate of
their Mortification by their Wooden Spoons,
but by that which is in them. The Father
Hermit drank to us in mo&s;t excellent Wine,
tho' out of a Wooden Cup: And for his part,
was not &s;lack to encourage us to eat and drink
by his good Example. <HI>I am no Hypocrite</HI> (&s;aid
he) <HI>as many Hermits are. When one comes to
Vi&s;it them, they will tell you, They have not eat of
Four days, and that they are yet Fasting: For my
part, to tell you Truth, I eat but Four times a day,
and do not think, that Holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in not Eat|ing,
but in Eating well, (that is, with giving
Thanks) except only on Fast-Days, enjoyned by the
Holy Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;eeing that our Father Hermit was in a
good humour, de&s;ired him to tell me his Opi|nion
concerning the Miraculous Chapel.</HI>
Alas, <HI>(&s;aid he)</HI> I was not there when the Mi|racle
was done; but if God was plea&s;ed to work
one for the Founding of it, we have need he &s;hould
work another now, for the pre&s;erving of it; for
ever and anon Stones fall down from the Rock,
and much endamage the Roof of it; &s;o that all
the Mony of the Pilgrims is &s;carcely &s;ufficient to
Repair it continually: But as for the Miracles
which are wrought in the Chapel, tho' they &s;ay
that a great many happen there every Day, we
never &s;aw &s;o much as One only. Yea, what is
more yet, about Thirty or Forty Miles from hence,
you &s;hall hear them talk of Miracles, which they
<PB N="209" REF="117">
&s;ay have been wrought here, that we our &s;elves
never heard of before. I &s;uppo&s;e them to be &s;ome
Beggars, who pa&s;s this way, and who go after|wards
into the Villages, and report there, that
they have been miraculou&s;ly healed of their Infir|mities,
to induce People to give more liberal Alms
to them. <HI>This Hermit expre&s;t a great Air of
&s;incerity in all that he &s;aid, which gave me
indeed a great e&s;teem for his Per&s;on; for ma|ny
others of his Coat, are &s;o far from owning
any &s;uch thing, that they would rather have
been of the Humour to exaggerate all &s;uch
Reports, and been ready to invent a thou&s;and
Fal&s;ities to rai&s;e the Credit of the place of
their Devotion. After Dinner the Hermit
had no lei&s;ure to Di&s;cour&s;e us any longer, by
rea&s;on of the great Numbers of Poor, that
waited at the Gate for his Charity. We
therefore took our leaves of him, after that
we had thanked him for his Civility and
his good Dinner, and &s;o return'd to</HI> Cajeta.</P>
<P>Seeing that an occa&s;ion has been here pre|&s;ented
me to &s;peak of the&s;e Hermits, and
that this hath brought to my remembrance
many things I have ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Italy</HI> concer|ning
this kind of Life, as well as tho&s;e that
profe&s;s it; I &s;hall continue to entertain you
therewith &s;ome longer time. I was a&s;toni&s;h'd
to &s;ee that the Eremitick State, which for|merly
was &s;o Flouri&s;hing in <HI>Italy,</HI> as may be
&s;een, by &s;o many antient Foundations, and
Places, which are &s;till at this day call'd Her|mitages,
<PB N="210" REF="118">
(tho' no Hermites live in them) are
now fallen into &s;o great Decadence, that
&s;carcely are there &s;ome few of them to be
found here and there. In S. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s time,
<HI>Italy</HI> was full of Hermitages, and he him&s;elf
profe&s;t an Hermetick Life, before the Mo|na&s;tick.
At that time there were Men of Lear|ning
and Piety, who retir'd into Hermita|ges,
to have the better opportunity, by being
&s;eparated from the World, of applying them|&s;elves,
more entirely to Study and Contem|plation;
whereas the pre&s;ent Hermites are no
other, but a company of mi&s;erable Wretches,
of the Sink of the common People, who
have neither Learning nor Parts, and where|of
the greater part lead a very di&s;orderly and
&s;candalous Life. The rea&s;on whereof is, becau&s;e
the Monks, being in proce&s;s of time become
very Powerful, have po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of all
the be&s;t Hermitages, that were endow'd with
&s;tanding Revenues, and made Priories of them,
which they Incorporated with their Abbeys;
and the Mendicant Orders gleaning after
them, took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of well nigh all tho&s;e
which were near to Cities, or great Bur|roughs,
and there built their Convents: So
that there are none remaining now, but &s;ome
in Solitary and far di&s;tant Places, and a very
few, that are near to Cities. The Hermites
that are the Inhabitants of the&s;e latter Her|mitages,
have enough to do, to defend them|&s;elves
again&s;t the <HI>Capucins</HI> and other <HI>Mandi|cants,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="118">
who endeavour to &s;upplant, or at lea&s;t
to decry them, and bring them into Di&s;re|pute.
Tho&s;e who live in &s;olitary and far
di&s;tant Places are much &s;u&s;pected, becau&s;e
there have been frequently found among&s;t
them &s;ome that were the greate&s;t Villains
imaginable, who Murther'd all tho&s;e that
came to Vi&s;it their Hermitages, and Robb'd
upon the High-way. This is the rea&s;on why
Hone&s;t Men do not care to make their Re|treat
in any of tho&s;e Places. Wherefore com|monly
they are none but poor Men, that
make them&s;elves Hermites, in hopes, that in
favour of that Habit, they may find a Sub|&s;i&s;tence
from the Liberality of &s;ome of the
good Country Folks, if they can but once
get the knack of dexterou&s;ly Playing the Hy|pocrites.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here relate to you a deceit that I
my &s;elf di&s;cover'd, of two <HI>French</HI> Hermites,
who lived on one of the Hermitages, which
are on the Mountain call'd S. <HI>Sylvester,</HI> about
a days Journy from <HI>Rome,</HI> but by another
Name, Mount <HI>Soracte.</HI> I was gon from
<HI>Rome</HI> with an intent to take a View of the
Country, which they call <HI>la Sabine,</HI> which is
not above three or four days Journy from
thence, being Famous for having once been
the abode of the ancient <HI>Sabini,</HI> who &s;igna|liz'd
them&s;elves by &s;o many brave Exploits
again&s;t the <HI>Romans.</HI> I took up my Lodging,
the fir&s;t Night, in a Village, which is near to
<PB N="212" REF="119">
the Mount S. <HI>Sylvester,</HI> and the next Mor|ning
the curio&s;ity took me to endeavour to
get up to it. They told me, there was but
one only Path-way to get up to it, which was
on the other &s;ide of the Mountain, &s;o that
I had a great way to go about to get thither:
Wherefore viewing well the Top of the
Mountain, it appear'd to me, that I might
very well &s;ave my &s;elf the trouble of going
that great way about, in mounting by a cer|tain
pa&s;&s;age, which &s;eem'd to me as if it had
been a troden Path, and the Stones that were
above it, appear'd to me like Steps, by which
one might get up to the Top. Wherefore
without any further con&s;ideration, I put my
&s;elf forward to make an a&s;&s;ault upon this
high Mountain. I &s;carcely was got up the
one half of this way, but I found I was ex|treamly
mi&s;taken in my account, and that
tho&s;e Stones which had appear'd to me &s;o
little, and by which it &s;eem'd I might ea&s;ily
gain the Top of the Mountain, were indeed
no other than great Rocks heap'd upon one
another, which made the Top of the Moun|tain
in acce&s;&s;ible. However, I continu'd &s;till
to a&s;cend, rather for my Recreation, and to
&s;ee how far I could get, than in any hopes of
compa&s;&s;ing my fir&s;t de&s;ign, the execution
whereof did then &s;eem to me impo&s;&s;ible. I
mounted, I clambred, I crept, into the Clefts
of the Rocks, and by the help of certain Roots
of Trees, I rai&s;ed my &s;elf up to &s;ome great
<PB N="213" REF="119">
Rocks, whence I perceiv'd that I was come
near to the Top. This added new Spirits to
me, and &s;o much the more Courage, becau&s;e
I &s;aw there would be more danger, in at|tempting
to get down again, to the place
from whence I was mounted, than to get up
to the very Top. Accordingly I pro&s;ecuted
my intent, and being come up higher, I was
extreamly a&s;toni&s;h'd, to find among&s;t the
Stones, great Pieces of brown Bread, and in
very great quantity, &s;ome of them being
Mouldy and quite Rotten, and others yet
very fre&s;h.</P>
<P>At la&s;t after &s;ome new and la&s;t Efforts,
which I would not now begin again, I found
my &s;elf all on a &s;uddain in a very fine Gar|den,
which was Enclos'd on all &s;ides with
very high Walls, except only on that &s;ide
where it was thought in acce&s;&s;ible. This was
the Garden belonging to one of the Hermi|tages;
and I de&s;cri'd in it two Hermits,
who were taking their Recreation in a Bower,
&s;haded with plea&s;ant Green-Trees. The&s;e
Hermits were &s;orely affrighted at me, and
taking me for &s;ome Gho&s;t, betook them&s;elves
to their Heels, and being got into their Her|mitage,
they Barricado'd it again&s;t me. I was
quite &s;pent with the extream pains I had taken,
out of Breath, and in a great Sweat; &s;o I
went to re&s;t my &s;elf in the Bower they had
left, to &s;ee whether I could retrieve my Spirits
again. I found here, the remains of a great
<PB N="214" REF="120">
Pa&s;ty, and of a large Bottle of Wine; and
upon a Bench, on the other &s;ide of me a Fan
and a Coiff. The Hermites at la&s;t being re|cover'd
a little of their Fright, ventur'd again
into the Garden, and came to acco&s;t me.
They were a&s;toni&s;h'd to hear, that I had made
a &s;hift to get up by the Rocks. I &s;oon di&s;|cover'd
them to be <HI>French</HI> Men, and they told
me, that it was about two years, &s;ince they
had begun to live in that Hermitage: I &s;poke
to them concerning the Pieces of brown Bread
that I had found, and I took notice that this
brought a fre&s;h Colour into their Faces; and
fora&s;much as they perceiv'd that I had taken
notice of the Gloves, Coif, and Fan, that
were left in the Bower, one of them took the
Word, and told me, <HI>Sir, as you are a</HI> French-<HI>Man,
we hope that you will have the goodne&s;s,
not to do us any Prejudice. We will hide nothing
from you, but &s;incerely Confe&s;s that it is we, that
have thrown away the&s;e bits of Bread, in the
place where you met with them; for we never
had the de&s;ign of being good Hermites; we have
always been Souldiers by Profe&s;&s;ion, before that
we took this Habit upon us. It was a</HI> French
<HI>Hermit, a great Runner of the Countries, and who
made a &s;hift to live very well in</HI> Italy, <HI>that per|&s;uaded
us to do as much, and to follow the &s;ame
Cour&s;e, and procured the Habit of Hermits for us
at</HI> Rome: <HI>and having &s;ome time after found
this Hermitage Vacant, we retired thither, and
we have lived here, as other Hermits do, on the
<PB N="215" REF="120">
Alms we beg in the Neighbouring Villages. We at
first refu&s;ed to change our brown Bread for other
Nece&s;&s;aries, among&s;t the poor Pea&s;ants; but when
this came to the knowledge of many Per&s;ons, it
was a great prejudice to us, in our Que&s;ts, and
they began to reproach us for dainty Per&s;ons, that
could eat no Brown Bread; wherefore we now
rather chu&s;e to ca&s;t it to the Crows, than either to
&s;ell or give it away. And thus much for the Pieces
of Bread you met with. But &s;eeing you have ca&s;t
your Eyes upon &s;ome Female Ornaments, that are
left here with us, we &s;hall tell you the My&s;tery
of them al&s;o, in order to de&s;ire you, to give us
your Advice, in a bu&s;ine&s;s that extreamly perplex|eth
me and my Companion.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Hermitage which is joyned to ours,
there lives an <HI>Italian</HI> Hermit of a very bad
Life, tho' he be not known for &s;uch. He hath de|bauched
a Roman Gentlewoman, whom he has
kept with him, for &s;ome Months; and &s;eeing he
had no pro&s;pect of keeping her with him long, but
that we must di&s;cover, becau&s;e we have &s;ome
Windows that look out, towards his Hermitage,
and that we go daily to Vi&s;it him, with a great
deal of Freedom; he rather cho&s;e to Communi|cate
the Matter to us, than to endeavour to con|ceal
it. He hath made a hole in the Wall of our
Garden, by which his Lady, in ca&s;e of &s;udden
Surprize, or of any one coming to Vi&s;it him, might
retire her &s;elf into our Hermitage. For the re&s;t,
we have nothing but the &s;ight of her; for he is
&s;o extreamly Jealous, that he keeps her all the
<PB N="216" REF="121">
day &s;hut up in a Hole, that differs nothing from
a Pri&s;on; and when at any time he brings her to
take a Walk, he continues all the while with her.
And it &s;eems &s;he does not think much of it neither,
for &s;he loves him extreamly. 'Tis &s;he that fur|ni&s;heth
all manner of Expences; for &s;he hath
brought abundance of Gold and Silver along with
her from <HI>Rome.</HI> And to &s;peak the Truth, we
have found our &s;elves very well, &s;ince the Her|mit
has Di&s;cover'd all to us; for there is not a
day pa&s;&s;eth over our Heads, in which we do not
receive &s;ome Pre&s;ent or other from them. He
came and gave us a Vi&s;it this Morning, with his
Lady, and they brought with them the Pa&s;ty and
Bottle you have &s;een; it is not much above a quar|ter
of an hour &s;ince they are gone, and it &s;eems
the Gentlewoman forgot to take her Fan and Gloves
with her. It was great good luck for you Sir,
that you did not come whil&s;t he was here, for he
would certainly have kill'd you, for fear of being
Di&s;covered. He carries always a great Dagger
under his Gown, to make u&s;e of it upon occa&s;ion:
Neither would we advi&s;e you, to &s;tay here any con|&s;iderable
time, for &s;hould he return hither, as &s;ome|times
he does, and as in all likelyhood he will, to
fetch the things his Lady has left behind her, you
would be in great Danger. We only de&s;ire you
would be plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us with your Coun&s;el,
how we might be&s;t di&s;cover this, without doing
our &s;elves a Mi&s;chief. I told them that the
most &s;afe, and &s;hort way was to acquaint the
Cardinal Vicar, and that they needed not to trou|ble
<PB N="217" REF="121">
them&s;elves any further: And that as for my part,
I knew not, whether I &s;hould return to <HI>Rome</HI> or
no. They told me that this Hermit was &s;o cunning,
that now for &s;ome time they had not durst &s;o much
as to take one &s;tep towards <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;o narrowly
did he watch them.</P>
<P>I had been told, that there was a very fair
Abby of <HI>Bernardines</HI> upon the &s;ame Mountain,
and therefore I asked the Hermits, why they
did not di&s;cover the matter to the Abbot; but
they repli'd, that they knew they would not
be welcome there with &s;uch a Story, becau&s;e all
the Monks there led a very di&s;&s;olute Life, and
had all of them their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, as well as the
Hermit. Moreover they told me, that they &s;u&s;|pected
the Hermit to be a Sorcerer, which
made them the more fearful, to make the lea&s;t
&s;tep towards the di&s;covering of him. That
they were of opinion al&s;o, that he had be|witch'd
this Gentlewoman, becau&s;e that tho'
he had no con&s;iderable Qualities, and was be|&s;ides
very deform'd in Body, with a great
&s;lovenly Beard, a &s;tinking Breath, and rotten
Teeth, yet that &s;he had always loved him
Pa&s;&s;ionately, from the time that &s;he had fir&s;t
receiv'd one of his Letters, wherein was en|clo&s;ed
a Piece of white-Wax, like unto an
<HI>Agnus Dei.</HI> That they had al&s;o frequently
had cau&s;e to admire his knowledge of many
&s;ecret things, that had hapned at very far
di&s;tant Places, all which gave them great &s;u&s;|picion,
that he had to do with the Devil.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="122">
They were about to tell me more of him;
but the fear into which they had put me,
le&s;t this Venerable Hermit might return to
give me a Vi&s;it, made me, after that in a few
words I had exhorted them not to follow &s;uch
wicked Examples, and to have the Fear of
God before their Eyes, to take my leave of
them, de&s;iring them to &s;hew me the way to the
Abby of the Fathers, where I intended to go
and &s;ay Ma&s;s, having made a Vow to do &s;o,
at the Altar of S. <HI>Sylve&s;ter,</HI> when in clam|bring
the Rocks, I found my &s;elf in great dan|ger
of my Life. This was al&s;o the rea&s;on
why I refus'd to Eat or Drink with the&s;e Her|mits,
becau&s;e no Man may &s;ay Ma&s;s except
he be Fa&s;ting. So I went a little higher up
the Mountain, by a very plea&s;ant way, and
I Arriv'd at the Abby, ju&s;t at Dinner time.
I had much ado to get the Church Door
open'd for me, in order to acquit my &s;elf of
my Vow. After I had &s;aid Ma&s;s, I de&s;ir'd
them to let me &s;ee the Mona&s;tery; but they
made great difficulty al&s;o to grant me this
Reque&s;t; becau&s;e the Monks, according to the
Cu&s;tom of <HI>Italy,</HI> were almo&s;t all of them gone
to take their re&s;t. However at la&s;t one of the
Monks, by order of the Prior, led me into
a &s;mall Garden, which he told me was the
place, whither S. <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> retir'd him&s;elf, du|ring
the Per&s;ecution, which afflicted the
Church in his time, and that there he wrought
that great Miracle, whereof mention is made
<PB N="219" REF="122">
in his Life time, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;ome of the Em|perours
Men being come to look for him, the
Saint had a de&s;ire to entertain them; but
having nothing wherewith, he &s;ent a Deacon
that &s;erv'd him, to Sow &s;ome Carots in the
Garden; and having about an Hour after or|der'd
&s;ome of them to be taken up for Din|ner,
his Men went in a way of Mockery and
Deri&s;ion to him, but were extreamly &s;urpriz'd,
when being come at the place where the Carot
Seed had been Sow'd, they found very fair
and large Carots, of an admirable good ta&s;te,
and which &s;erv'd for a Dinner to his Gue&s;ts.
The Monk told me, that this Miracle had
in &s;ome &s;ort been continu'd ever &s;ince; for
that the Carots, that were Sown in that Gar|den,
retain an extraordinary plea&s;ant ta&s;te.
Upon his telling of me &s;o, I made bold, to
pluck up one of them out of the Ground, and
having &s;crap'd it with my Knife, I ta&s;ted of
it, by way of Devotion; but found it of a very
flat ta&s;te: I threw it away; Hold Sir, &s;aid the
Religious, they are not to be Eaten &s;o, they
mu&s;t be Boyl'd, and dre&s;t with good Oil, or
good Butter, and good Spices. We have a
Cook that knows how to dre&s;s them admi|rably
well. You put &s;o many good things
to them, my good Father, &s;aid I, &s;miling, that
at la&s;t you make them, if not miraculou&s;ly,
at lea&s;t admirably good. This Religious, after
having &s;hew'd me the Garden only, had the
Civility, according to the Order he had re|ceived,
<PB N="220" REF="123">
to lead me to a Chamber where I was
to Dine: They brought me a Di&s;h with Fi&s;h,
and another with &s;ome of tho&s;e Holy Roots,
which indeed were extreamly well dre&s;t.</P>
<P>After Dinner I apply'd my &s;elf to take a
view of the Top of Mount <HI>Sora&eacute;le,</HI> from
whence certainly there is the be&s;t Pro&s;pect
that can be, the whole Country about <HI>Rome</HI>
lying open to it, together with that Proud
City, in its whole extent. This Mountain
&s;tands &s;ingle, and is not joyned to any other,
having on all &s;ides of it mo&s;t rich and fertil
Plains, that &s;urround it, and being very
high and &s;teep on all &s;ides with great white
Rocks, one would take it, at a di&s;tance, for
&s;ome very high Steeple, having its Top in the
Clouds; and more e&s;pecially in the Winter
time, when the Snow covers &s;ome little Shrubs
of Trees, which have their Roots in the Rocks,
whereof <HI>Horace</HI> makes mention in one of his
Odes;
<Q><L>Cernis ut alt&acirc; &s;tet Nive candidum</L>
<L>Soracte&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I came down the Mountain by a much
more plea&s;ant and ea&s;ie Way, than that by
which I went up to it. In my way I met
with the Old Hermit, of whom I made men|tion
before, who return'd from &s;aying Ma&s;s
in a Village at the Foot of the Mountain.
He enquir'd of me, Whether I had been to
<PB N="221" REF="123">
Vi&s;it the Hermitages, or the Abby? I told
him, that I came from the Holy Places, which
S. <HI>Sylve&s;ter</HI> had &s;anctified by his Retirement.
<HI>God be prai&s;ed for it, Sir,</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>it is very well
done of you. This is the good Pattern which the
other Hermits of this Mountain, and I my &s;elf, have
propounded to our &s;elves to imitate; and, to &s;peak
truth, he pours forth abundance of Graces upon
tho&s;e who are devoted to him, and put their Tru&s;t
in him. It is now One and Twenty years, I have
had the Honour of wearing the Sacred Habit you
&s;ee upon me; and the further I proceed, the more
plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction do I find in the Ways of
the Lord.</HI> To hear him Talk, one would have
taken him for another S. <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Thebes,</HI> who
was the fir&s;t Hermit. But for all his fine Talk,
I took care to keep my &s;elf at a certain
di&s;tance from him, that his great Dagger
might not reach me, in ca&s;e he had gon about
to make u&s;e of it. But at la&s;t, he bid me Fare|well,
wi&s;hing me a Thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings. He
held a great <HI>Bead-row,</HI> or <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI> of Wood
in his Hand, the Beads whereof were as big
as a Nut, and he had a Cro&s;s fa&s;tned to his
Girdle, with many great Medals, which made
a great Noi&s;e as he went, by &s;triking one
again&s;t the other; he leaned upon his Staff,
and in all points acted the Hypocrit to admi|ration.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="124">
The Eremitical Habit is of a brown Tawny
Colour, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;hort Tunicle, reaching
a little lower than the mid-Leg; they have a
great Cowl upon their Head of a Pyramidal
Figure, and a little Mantle about their Should|ers,
not much unlike to that of the <HI>Capucins.</HI>
The&s;e kind of Antick Habits &s;eem to have
been contriv'd for no other end, but to make
terrible impre&s;&s;ions on the Sen&s;es, the better
to di&s;po&s;e the Minds of Men to conceive a
great e&s;teem and veneration for tho&s;e that wear
them. He that &s;hould go about to vilifie or
undervalue this external Garb in the pre&s;ence
of a Papi&s;t, had almo&s;t as good profane what|&s;oever
is mo&s;t Holy in his Religion; as if for|&s;ooth
there could be no wicked Men in the
garb of Satyrs. I met with my two <HI>French</HI>
Hermits &s;ome time after at <HI>Venice;</HI> who told
me, <HI>They had accu&s;ed the Old Hermit, but he
having very dexterou&s;ly &s;lipt away his Lady, denied
all, and made the&s;e Poor Men to pa&s;s for Slan|derers;
to that degree had he Charmed the People
by his Hypocri&s;ie. Whereupon they had been forced
to quit their Hermitages, and were then going for</HI>
Hungary, <HI>to take upon them the Habit of Souldiers,
which</HI> (they &s;aid) <HI>was every whit as Holy, as that
of a Hermit.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;ince this, in my Travels, &s;een many
fair Hermitages, more particularly on the
<HI>Apennine,</HI> which are tho&s;e Mountains that
divide all <HI>Italy</HI> in the length of it. I have
had occa&s;ion to pa&s;s and repa&s;s them &s;everal
<PB N="223" REF="124">
times, in various parts of them, where are to
be &s;een wonderful places in the Woods, and
upon the very points of Rocks, which they
told me were Hermitages. But &s;ince the time
I knew, that the mo&s;t of tho&s;e that dwelt in
them were only a Company of ba&s;e Fellows,
I took care not to Vi&s;it them. Many of the&s;e
wretched Hermits have been publickly Exe|cuted
from time to time, for committing the
mo&s;t enormous Crimes. There was one of
them taken at <HI>Venice,</HI> who confe&s;&s;ed at his
Death, that he had killed above Three&s;core
Per&s;ons, as well Men as Women. He had his
Hermitage between <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Buran,</HI> in a
little I&s;land of about Two hundred Paces in
Circuit, where is &s;till to be &s;een the Ruins of
his Hermitage, which they demoli&s;hed. This
wretched Per&s;on went by Night to Sea in a
Di&s;gui&s;e, and Masked, accompanied with three
or four Robbers, to whom his Hermitage
&s;erv'd for a Retreat: They went and &s;topt the
<HI>Gondola's</HI> or &s;mall Boats that pa&s;t through the
Channels, and murther'd tho&s;e that refu&s;ed to
&s;urrender their Pur&s;es. There had been Re|ports
abroad, for a con&s;iderable time, of great
Robberies and Murthers, that were com|mitted
about this Hermitage; but who could
ever have believ'd, that a Per&s;on wearing &s;o
holy a Habit, and &s;o venerable a Beard, had
been the Head and Captain of the&s;e Mur|therers?
He was at la&s;t di&s;covered by the
Sons of a Rich Merchant of <HI>Venice;</HI> their
<PB N="224" REF="125">
Father, who took plea&s;ure in the Company of
&s;uch kind of Hypocrits, went one day out of De|votion
to Vi&s;it this Hermit, and had acquainted
his Wife and Sons with his intent. He carried
along with him &s;ome very good Provi&s;ions, to
Pre&s;ent him with; but this Impious Wretch
being not &s;atisfied with that, after he had got
him to enter into his Cell, took him by the
Throat and &s;trangled him. His Children being
a&s;toni&s;hed at their Fathers &s;taying &s;o long,
went with a great many of their Friends to
look for him, and entring into the Hermitage,
they found their Fathers Shoes under the Her|mit's
Bed; whereupon they immediately &s;eized
him, and having found the re&s;t of his Cloaths
in an Old Cupboard, the Hermit at la&s;t &s;hewed
them the place where he had ca&s;t his Body; it
was a great Hole, which formerly had &s;erv'd
for a Ci&s;tern, where they found the Bodies of
above Three&s;core Per&s;ons, that had been &s;acri|ficed
to the Fury and Avarice of this Infernal
Mon&s;ter. There is al&s;o great Talk in the
Country of <HI>Ancona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> of an Hermit, who
robb'd and murther'd the Pilgrims going to
<HI>Loretto;</HI> and of another between <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nonia</HI> and
<HI>Florence,</HI> that was no better than a Highway
Robber. The&s;e kind of Stories coming fre&s;h
to my mind, whenever in my Travels I met
with any Hermits or Hermitages, hinder'd me
from being over-curious to Vi&s;it them.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="125">
I could not &s;ufficiently lament (according
to the Principles in which I had been Educated)
that a State, which heretofore had been &s;o
flouri&s;hing in the Church of God, and &s;o
fruitful of Saints, was at la&s;t degenerated to
that degree, that the Hermitages were become
little el&s;e, but the Dens of Robbers and Mur|therers.
In former times Learned Men were
&s;een to retire to the&s;e places, to apply them|&s;elves
more uninterruptedly to their Studies,
leading mo&s;t vertuous and holy Lives; but at
pre&s;ent that Mode is quite out of date, and
a Man of Wit and Learning would be laugh'd
at, &s;hould he think of entring into this kind
of Life. But the Mona&s;teries, on the other
hand are in more Credit and Repute than ever,
notwith&s;tanding that the Eremitick Life hath
indeed been the Mother of the Mona&s;tick;
the fir&s;t Monks have been nothing el&s;e but
Hermits, who joyned them&s;elves together to
live in Common, and with this re&s;pect we &s;ay,
that <HI>Filia &s;uffocavit Matrem; the Daughter hath
devoured the Mother.</HI> The Rea&s;on whereof may
ea&s;ily be given: This Change did not happen
till after the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was mounted to
that pitch of Pomp and Pride, where we find
her at pre&s;ent. The Head and chief Members
that govern it, have affected to make &s;hew of
the mo&s;t magnificent and luxurious Court,
that it may be is in the whole World. Now
&s;uch a Court as this cannot but &s;tand in need
of great Incoms; and for the poor Hermits,
<PB N="226" REF="126">
they were the lea&s;t able to contribute any
thing towards it; this is the very Rea&s;on for
which they have neglected and almo&s;t quite
aboli&s;h'd them, to make the more way for the
Monks, who have well-lin'd Pur&s;es, and who
are oblig'd from time to time, to Pay in prodi|gious
Sums of Mony to the Apo&s;tolical Cham|ber.</P>
<P>They are the Bi&s;hops who confer the Habit
upon Hermits within their Dioce&s;s; but at
pre&s;ent there are many Bi&s;hops that refu&s;e to
admit any, and chu&s;e rather to leave the Her|mitages
vacant. The mo&s;t part of the&s;e Her|mits
under&s;tand no Latin, and &s;ome of them
can neither Write nor Read. How would you
have the&s;e Men &s;pend their time in this Soli|tude?
They become &s;oon weary of it; and
then turn Vagabond-Hermits, that run up and
down the Country. They undertake every
Year to Vi&s;it the Holy Places; that is to &s;ay,
to go to <HI>Rome,</HI> to <HI>Loretto,</HI> to S. <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Padua,</HI>
to S. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Bar,</HI> to <HI>Mount Gargan, &amp;c.</HI>
After that they have fini&s;hed their Round,
either they begin it anew, or they go and
&s;pend the two or three remaining Winter
Months in their Hermitages. At their Return,
the good People of the Country receive them
very gladly, becau&s;e they come ordinarily well
loaden with <HI>Agnus Dei's</HI> and <HI>Relicks,</HI> which
they di&s;tribute among&s;t them, and have al|ways
in a readine&s;s &s;ome plea&s;ant Story or other
to tell them. Be&s;ides, the Monks think it be|neath
<PB N="227" REF="126">
them&s;elves, to &s;peak to poor People;
whereas the Hermits make them&s;elves familiar
with them. But a Man mu&s;t have an Eye to
their Fingers, for they are very dextrous at
Pilfering what&s;oever they can lay their Hands
upon, which afterwards they &s;ell for Mony,
or make a Change of it in their Inns, for
good Lodging and Entertainment.</P>
<P>I hapned to be on a time at an Inn, where
&s;ome Hermits offered to &s;ell Children Clouts and
Swadling-Bands, and de&s;ired only to have a
good Dinner in lieu of them. The Ho&s;te&s;s
asked them, What way they had come by
them? adding, That &s;he was a&s;toni&s;h'd to &s;ee
them have &s;uch Gear to &s;ell, and that &s;he was
afraid they had &s;tolen them. The Hermits
prote&s;ted before God, they had not, but that a
Country-woman, who&s;e Child was Dead, had
given 'em them. Whil&s;t they were in this
Conte&s;t, the Woman of whom they had
&s;tolen them, came to the Inn, whom the Her|mits
no &s;ooner &s;aw, but they betook them&s;elves
to their Heels, leaving the Clouts and Swadling-Bands
behind them. The Woman told us, That
whil&s;t one of the&s;e Hermits was telling a Story,
of an Apparition of the Souls in Purgatory,
the other went forth into the Court, and took
away her Childs Clouts, which &s;he had hung up
there to dry.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="127">
Notwith&s;tanding the Heremetick State be &s;o
extreamly corrupted and degenerated, yet the
Papi&s;ts do not leave valuing them&s;elves much
upon this account, and making a great matter
of Honour of it to them&s;elves again&s;t the Pro|te&s;tants,
who (&s;ay they) have declared them|&s;elves
profe&s;t Enemies to all the&s;e Holy States,
which, as they pretend, were the greate&s;t Or|nament
of the Churches of the fir&s;t Ages;
and in imitation of the Life which <HI>Elias</HI> and
other of the Prophets did lead in the De&s;erts,
which S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> profe&s;&s;ed, and our
Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;anctified, by his
&s;o frequent retirings into Solitude; and of
that Life, in a word, which the fir&s;t Doctors
and Fathers of the Church, as <HI>Origen,</HI> S. <HI>Hie|rom,
&amp;c.</HI> have &s;o highly cheri&s;hed and com|mended:
To be even with them in this, I would
demand of them, what they them&s;elves make
of it? Who they are among&s;t them, that
make profe&s;&s;ion of this Excellent Life? What
Fruit it produceth? and whether it were not
much better, con&s;idering all the Di&s;orders that
have hapned by this means, and do &s;till daily
happen before their Eyes, wholly to cut off
from the Bo&s;om of the Church, a &s;ort of
Men who are become the Scandal of it, and
who having voluntarily plunged them&s;elves
into <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> which is the Mother of all Vices,
have, in fine, renounced all Vertues, whether
Civil, Moral, or Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="127">
Having thus given you &s;ome Account con|cerning
<HI>Hermits,</HI> I cannot well avoid giving
you a Relation of &s;ome very con&s;iderable
Places, which formerly have been the Retreats
of Solitudinarians, and are now the Abode of
Monks. And fora&s;much as I am here Di&s;|cour&s;ing
of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> I &s;hall
begin with that of <HI>Sublac,</HI> which was the place
S. <HI>Bennet</HI> cho&s;e for his Retreat, when he was as
yet but a young Child.</P>
<P>In another Journy I made to <HI>Naples,</HI> finding
my &s;elf near this place, &s;ome advantageous
Accounts I had receiv'd concerning it, in|clined
me to go and Vi&s;it it. I fir&s;t Arrived
at the Burrough of <HI>Sublac,</HI> where the Monks
of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> have both Temporal and Spiritual
Juri&s;diction. There is an Abby of Nuns of
the &s;ame Order; and a League further in the
&s;ame Valley, but in a part of it that is Nar|rower,
there is a very Fair Abby of Monks,
who are very Civil to Strangers, e&s;pecially to
tho&s;e who come with an intent of Vi&s;iting
the Grotto of their Patriarch S. <HI>Bennet.</HI> I
met here with a Father, who was a <HI>French</HI>
Man by Nation, and to whom my Relations
in <HI>France</HI> were not unknown, who was the
cau&s;e of &s;taying me here a whole Day; and
he him&s;elf led me to the Grotto of S. <HI>Bennet,</HI>
which is about a quarter of a League further,
in the Narrowe&s;t part of the &s;aid Valley.
The Mountains on both &s;ides are very &s;teep,
<PB N="230" REF="128">
and the Brook that runs between them takes
up well nigh the whole Space of the Valley.
However the&s;e Fathers have made a &s;hift to
find place enough to Build here a Mona&s;tery
all in length, which can contain Fifty or
Three&s;core Monks, and yet it &s;erves but for a
Lodging to Ten only, whom they call <HI>Hermits,</HI>
tho' indeed they be only &s;o by Name, becau&s;e
they live in a Community, and becau&s;e they
only &s;tay there for the &s;pace of Two Months;
after which they &s;end Ten others thither, out
of the Neighbouring Mona&s;tery, to relieve
them. Thus they &s;ucceed by Turns to one
another. The only difference there is in their
Ob&s;ervance is this, That tho&s;e of the Mona|&s;tery
where the Grotto of the Saint is, do eat
no Fle&s;h-Meat; and in the other (as throughout
all the Order in <HI>Italy)</HI> they eat Meat Four
times a Week, notwith&s;tanding that the u&s;e
of it be forbid them by the Rules of their
In&s;titution, which they have Vow'd to ob|&s;erve.
They &s;ay, It is out of the Re&s;pect they
have to the&s;e Rules, that their Abbots have
order'd, That no Fle&s;h &s;hould be eaten in this
Little Mona&s;tery, no more than in their Great
One of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nt Ca&s;&s;in,</HI> that it might be true at
lea&s;t&punc; That the Rule of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> was ob&s;erv'd
in Two of their Mona&s;teries; which, as they
believe, is &s;ufficient to quiet their Con&s;ciences
as to this matter. The Fathers pretend, for|&s;ooth,
That the Bodies of Men are much
changed in their Con&s;titution &s;ince the time
<PB N="231" REF="128">
of their Legi&s;lator; and that they are not &s;o
&s;trong, nor con&s;equently &s;o able to undergo
&s;uch Rigid Ob&s;ervances; and indeed they
Treat all their other Rules much in the &s;ame
manner, and content them&s;elves with the ob|&s;erving
of them by Turns, or by Halves.</P>
<P>In this Little Mona&s;tery, they &s;hewed me
the Grotto of S. <HI>Bennet,</HI> upon which they
have built an Altar; and we &s;ee there al&s;o a
mo&s;t curious Statue of white Marble, repre|&s;enting
this Saint, very young, and upon his
Knees, with a Countenance very humble and
penitent. The Habit wherewith he is repre|&s;ented,
&s;erves to condemn that which the
<HI>Benedictins</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> do wear at pre&s;ent; they
have &s;o amplified and pleated it, for to make
it &s;hew fine and magnificent, that it is no
more to be known to be a Copy from this
Original. The Father <HI>Benedictins</HI> of the Con|gregation
of S. <HI>Maurus</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> have taken
the form of their Habit from this Figure, and
retain the &s;ame to this Day, as believing it
with Rea&s;on, to be the true Pattern. After we
had &s;aid our Prayers in this Little Chapel,
they led me to a little Garden, and they bade
me take notice of a huge Stone at the Top
of the Rock; they wi&s;hed me to ob&s;erve it
very well, as being no le&s;s than a perpetual
Miracle, which demon&s;trated the vi&s;ible Pro|tection
God afforded to that Holy Place, and
to tho&s;e that dwelt there. This Stone, accord|ing
to their Talk, was quit loo&s;ned from the
<PB N="232" REF="129">
Rock, and &s;u&s;pended in the Air, by the alone
Divine Power, God not &s;uffering it to fall
down, becau&s;e, if it &s;hould, it could not fail
of utterly de&s;troying the Grotto, and the
whole Mona&s;tery. I told them, after that I
had viewed it very narrowly, that I &s;aw it &s;o
well fa&s;tned to the Rock, that in my thoughts
it would be a Miracle indeed if it &s;hould fall,
and that they ought not to pretend the con|trary
to tho&s;e that had good Eyes. I &s;aw
well enough, that my An&s;wer did not plea&s;e
them; but I was &s;o weary to hear them talk
of &s;uch kind of Miracles, which they will
force upon Men contrary to all Rea&s;on, that
I could not, by times, hinder my &s;elf from
expre&s;&s;ing my re&s;entment of it. The <HI>French</HI> Fa|ther,
that was my Guide, wi&s;h'd me to ca&s;t
my Eye upon certain Ro&s;e-Trees, which were
in a Corner of the Garden, and told me,
that as &s;oon as we were got out of the Hermi|tage,
he would tell me the my&s;tery of them.
And in the mean time he &s;hewed me the re&s;t
of the Buildings. I did not find the place &s;o
frightful, as was the Impre&s;&s;ion they had
given me of it; tho' it mu&s;t be owned, That
in S. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Time it was a very De&s;ert
place.</P>
<P>Having therefore taken a View of all, we
return'd to the Great Mona&s;tery, from
whence we came; where being arrived, the
Father told me as to tho&s;e Ro&s;e-Trees, which
he had wi&s;hed me to take notice of, that
<PB N="233" REF="129">
the Monks had not thought &s;itting to tell me
of the great Miracle, wherewith they com|monly
entertain Strangers, for fear I &s;hould
reflect upon them for it, as I did upon occa|&s;ion
of the Stone. <HI>It is Related</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>in the
Life of our Ble&s;&s;ed Father S.</HI> Bennet, <HI>That he
had one day a furious Temptation of the Fle&s;h in
this place; and that in order to quell it, he went
and rowled him&s;elf &s;tark naked upon Thistles and
Thorns, that were near unto his Cell, and made all
his Body on a Gore-blood, until he found that the
Temptation was quite di&s;&s;ipated. Now the Hi&s;tory
tells us, that the&s;e Thi&s;tles and Thorns, ting'd
with the Blood of S.</HI> Bennet, <HI>were miraculou&s;ly
changed into Ro&s;es. Wherefore &s;pecial Care has
been taken always to pre&s;erve the&s;e Ro&s;e-Trees, the
Ro&s;es whereof we dry, and being pulverized, do
exhibit them to tho&s;e that are Sick; for it is an
univer&s;al Remedy again&s;t all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es,
to tho&s;e who take them in Faith.</HI> I told this
<HI>French</HI> Father, That the Monks his Confraters
had done very well not to mention this Mi|racle
to me, for I &s;hould pre&s;ently have put
them in mind of the Fable of <HI>Pyramis</HI> and
<HI>Thisbe,</HI> who&s;e Blood changed the colour of
<HI>Mulberries</HI> from white to red. Could they
have &s;hewn me Thi&s;tles, Nettles, or &s;ome
Blackberry-Bu&s;hes and Brambles that brought
forth Ro&s;es, this would have been &s;omething
rare indeed, I will not &s;ay miraculous (for I
know not whether they have found out the
Art of grafting Ro&s;e-Trees upon the&s;e kind of
<PB N="234" REF="130">
Wild Plants) but to &s;hew a Man Ro&s;e-Tree
that bears Ro&s;es, this is a thing we &s;ee every
day, without ever dreaming of a Miracle.
And as to what concerns their miraculous
Operation, in Curing all manner of Maladies,
that they had very advi&s;edly added this Clau&s;e,
<HI>If they be made u&s;e of in Faith:</HI> For if tho&s;e
that take of this Powder in their Sickne&s;s
chance to die, 'tis becau&s;e there was no Faith
in them; but if they e&s;cape, it is a plain
Miracle.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fathers are extream Rich, and almo&s;t
all the Country round about, to a very great
di&s;tance, belongs to them. The next Day I
went up to a Mountain, where they &s;hewed
me a Chapel, which S. <HI>Bennet</HI> caus'd to be
built; and about Seven miles further, they
&s;hewed me another, Dignified with a New
Miracle, which is, the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Body
of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> upon a Rock. The Story of it is
this, They tell us, <HI>That this Saint being on a
time Benighted, he was forc'd to beg Lodging of
a Prie&s;t that lived in tho&s;e Parts, who very
uncivilly denied him. The Saint being &s;o ex|treamly
tired, that he could no longer keep him|&s;elf
&s;tanding, lean'd again&s;t a Rock, which
received his Body with the &s;ame ea&s;e, as if it had
been a &s;oft Bed, where he re&s;ted all that Night;
which impre&s;&s;ion of his Body</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>remain'd
there ever &s;ince.</HI> True it is, that &s;uch an Im|pre&s;&s;ion
is indeed found there, but who has
made it I cannot tell you, except you will believe
the Miracle.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="130">
From this place I took Directions of the
Way to <HI>Mont Ca&s;&s;in,</HI> which is about Three
&s;mall days Journy from thence. Here it is
you may take a view of the Glory of the
Mona&s;tick State, in all its lu&s;tre. The &s;tately
Buildings which the&s;e Fathers have rai&s;ed
upon this Mountain, make it appear to be the
Head of an Order. The place is exceed|ing
plea&s;ant, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with
Rich Vallies, and Little Hills, over which
<HI>Mont Ca&s;&s;in</HI> commands by its height, and by
the Temporal and Spiritual Juri&s;diction the
Monks do exerci&s;e over a great many Towns
Villages which lye round about it. Among&s;t
the re&s;t there is a very pretty City &s;ituate at
the Foot of <HI>Mont Ca&s;&s;in,</HI> which is called
S. <HI>Germain.</HI> The Abbot has Epi&s;copal Juri&s;|diction
there, and keeps his Grand Vicar, who
is a Monk of the &s;ame Order. I went to &s;ee
him, to get permi&s;&s;ion of him to &s;ay Ma&s;s, and
afterwards I went up to the Mountain. They
have made the Acce&s;s to it very fair and ea&s;ie,
and one a&s;cends near Four <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, before
one comes to the Mona&s;tery. A man mu&s;t
not expect here any great Antiquities, this Place
having been &s;everal times ruined by the Wars,
and by Fire, which did not &s;o much as leave
one Stone upon another. The only Remain
of Antiquity they &s;hew one is, the Remainder
of an Old Steeple, which the Monks have
extraordinarily embeli&s;h'd within, as &s;uppo&s;ing
it to be the place where S. <HI>Bennet</HI> died, and
<PB N="236" REF="131">
that God as by Miracle had pre&s;erved it,
among&s;t &s;o many De&s;olations and Fires, as of
Old he did the Ark of <HI>Noah,</HI> in the mid&s;t of
the Deluge. They will have every one that
enters it, to put off his Shoes; and they them|&s;elves,
when they go in, make very &s;trange
Po&s;tures and Faces. They maintain, That
they have the whole Body of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> in their
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that what was &s;aid of his Tran|&s;lation
to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Fleury</HI> in <HI>France,</HI>
is no more than a Fable: According to which
Suppo&s;ition, all the great Miracles which the
<HI>Benedictins</HI> of <HI>France</HI> pretend to have wrought,
at the Tran&s;lation of it, mu&s;t be very grand
Impo&s;tures. And we may &s;ee by this &s;cant|ling,
how the Monks make no Bones of Ac|cu&s;ing
one another of Fraud and Impo&s;ture,
when their Intere&s;t is concern'd.</P>
<P>Several Popes who had a Kindne&s;s for <HI>Mont
Ca&s;&s;in,</HI> have been plea&s;ed to make an E&s;&s;ay of
their Infallibility, by declaring, That the
Body, which they never &s;aw, is there whole
and entire: Other Popes, on the contrary,
who were more concern'd for the <HI>Benedictins</HI>
of <HI>France,</HI> have Thunder'd out their <HI>Anathe|thema's</HI>
again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;hould &s;ay, That the
Body of the &s;ame S. <HI>Bennet</HI> was at <HI>Mont Ca&s;&s;in.</HI>
So that upon the matter, we do not know who
to believe, for here is Infallibility again&s;t In|fallibility;
and a Papi&s;t cannot believe what
one Pope hath pronounced about it, without
falling into the Excommunications of another,
<PB N="237" REF="131">
which you'l &s;ay, is a very hard ca&s;e. How|&s;oever
it may be, the Fathers of <HI>Mont Ca&s;&s;in</HI>
tell you plainly, That they have it; and for
proof thereof, they maintain a Race of great
Ravens in their Mona&s;teries, which they de|clare
to be the Off-&s;pring of a Raven, who
render'd a great piece of Service to S. <HI>Bennet,</HI>
by carrying away an empoy&s;on'd Leaf, which
a wicked Prie&s;t had &s;ent him. The&s;e Ravens
are very familiar, and the Fathers tell us,
That the Charm which keeps them in that
Place, is the Odour of the Body of S. <HI>Bennet:</HI>
Tho' for my part, I &s;hould rather incline to
believe, That it is the Odour of their Fat
Kitchin; for they are continually &s;tuffing of
them, and a great many Poor People might
have their Sub&s;i&s;tence from what they allow
the&s;e Birds. The&s;e Ravens in Colour do well
re&s;emble the&s;e Monks, who are Cloath'd all
in Black, and for di&s;tinctions &s;ake are called
<HI>Black Fryers, Monachi Neri.</HI> Furthermore,
they &s;hew'd me all the Regular Places, the
Cloi&s;ters, Dormitories, the Apartments for the
Officers, the Gardens, and the Back&s;ides: All
which carry a greater &s;hew of the Grandure
and Maje&s;ty of a Palace Royal, than of an
Abode for Monks. But the Church above all
things is extreamly well and &s;umptuou&s;ly A|dorn'd,
being embeli&s;h'd with Marble, Ja&s;per,
Porphyry, and other precious Stones; and in
particular, the Gilding and Painting you &s;ee
there, are of an ine&s;timable Value.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="132">
They ob&s;erve &s;till in this Abby, the Lau|dable
Cu&s;tom of Entertaining all Strangers,
and Pilgrims, according to their Rank and
Quality, and indeed Per&s;ons are very well en|tertain'd
there, tho' it be only with Eggs,
Herbs, and Fi&s;h. For, as I have &s;aid, in ano|ther
place, they profe&s;s to ob&s;erve their Rule,
according to the Rigor of it, in this Mona|&s;tery,
in hopes of excu&s;ing, by this means, the
decadence and failure of all the re&s;t. But I
have been &s;ince informed after what manner
they acquit them&s;elves of their Vow. They
&s;end their Religious by turns into the Coun|try,
for a Month or two, to Fatten and Plump
them; which time expir'd, they recall them
again to their Ob&s;ervance, at which they
are kept the &s;ame &s;pace of time, after which
they &s;end them again to be Fatted anew. Af|ter
this manner do they mutually &s;olace and
relieve one another among&s;t them&s;elves with
an Holy Brotherly Love, whereby they find
them&s;elves much benefited. One of the&s;e
Monks, on a time, &s;uppos'd him&s;elf to have
found the Secret, to &s;pare him&s;elf and his
Brethren, the Pains and Trouble of all the&s;e
Flittings and Removes. He had made his
reflection upon a Hymn of S. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> which
they Sing on Friday Morning, where &s;peak|ing
of the Works of the Fifth days Creation,
which were the Fi&s;hes and the Birds, he hath
the&s;e words,
<Q><PB N="239" REF="132">
<L>Qui fertili natos aqu&acirc;</L>
<L>Partim relinquis Gurgiti,</L>
<L>Partim levas in Aera.</L></Q>
From whence he inferr'd, that fora&s;much as the
Fi&s;h and Birds proceeded both from one Matter,
to wit, the Water, they might indifferently
pa&s;s for Fi&s;h, as being in Sub&s;tance nothing
but the &s;ame thing. Be&s;ides the Re&s;emblance
there is between the Fins of Fi&s;hes, and the
Wings of Birds, helpt to flatter his Imagina|tion,
as a further Confirmation of his Notion;
he de&s;ired his Brethren to Meditate a
while upon this My&s;tery, which being once
unfolded, might be &s;o profitable to them.
The Notion was found to be very good, and
they made no more ado but with one con|&s;ent
pre&s;ented a Petition to the Abbot, that
they might have leave from thence forward,
to Eat the Fi&s;h that flies in the Air. The
Abbot &s;uppos'd that his Religious had taken
up the Holy Re&s;olution of Reforming them|&s;elves
to a higher Degree, and that they would
for time to come, ab&s;tain wholly from Fi&s;h al|&s;o;
for if they Eat nothing, &s;aid he in him|&s;elf,
but the Fi&s;h that flies in the Air, they
will not need any great &s;tore of Oil to Fry
them with. Wherefore he very readily grant|ed
their Reque&s;t; but he was extreamly a&s;to|ni&s;hed,
when entring the next day into the
Refectory, he found all the Table charged
<PB N="240" REF="133">
with good Foul, both Boil'd and Roa&s;ted, as
Woodcocks, Partridges, and all others that
were in &s;ea&s;on. He pre&s;ently &s;ent for the
Steward of the Mona&s;tery to come to him,
and tho&s;e who had made the&s;e Provi&s;ions, in|tending
to Jobe them very &s;everely: But they
putting him in mind of the Permi&s;&s;ion he had
granted them, and Quoting the pa&s;&s;age out
of S. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> and the 20, 21, and 22 Ver|&s;es
of the Fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> the poor
Abbot, was put to a Nonplus, by the &s;ubtilty
of their Rea&s;onings, and allow'd it &s;hould be
continued. The matter being divulged &s;ome
time after, it came to the Ears of their Car|dinal
Protector at <HI>Rome,</HI> who &s;ent a Letter to
them, by which he exhorted them, either
ab&s;olutely to Eat Fle&s;h, if they had a de&s;ire
&s;o to do, or el&s;e to Eat nothing but the Fi&s;h
that lives in the Waters, for that otherwi&s;e
it was to be feared, the People would learn
by their Example, to Eat cramb'd Capons in
<HI>Lent;</HI> and leaving the Swimming, betake
them&s;elves to the Flying Fi&s;hes&punc; It is not a|bove
Twelve years &s;ince, that the Reformed
Benedictins of the Congregation of S. <HI>Marus</HI>
in <HI>France,</HI> practi&s;ed much a like thing: They
Eat nothing but Otters and Badgers, as long
as they could get any of them, taking the&s;e
Animals for Fi&s;h, becau&s;e they live along the
Rivers, and feed upon Fi&s;h; and fora&s;|much
as they did al&s;o Eat them in <HI>Lent,</HI> this
extreamly &s;candaliz'd the People in the Pro|vinces
<PB N="241" REF="133">
of <HI>France,</HI> where Otters and Badgers
are look'd upon as Meat. Wherefore the
Bi&s;hops were fain to de&s;ire the Fathers, for
time to come, to ab&s;tain from eating of
them, as they do at pre&s;ent. By this it ap|pears
that all this &s;ort of People, who out|wardly
profe&s;s to live a Life of Penance, do
it &s;ore again&s;t their Will; and could one &s;ee
all that pa&s;&s;es in Secret in their Mona&s;teries,
the World would be no longer abus'd by
their Hypocry&s;ie.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only give you an account of one
famous Hermitage more, which lies in <HI>Swi&s;|&s;erland,</HI>
and afterwards pro&s;ecute my Journy
to <HI>Naples.</HI> This Hermitage is call'd <HI>Encylas,</HI>
and the <HI>Benedictins,</HI> who have made them|&s;elves
Ma&s;ters of it, have there at pre&s;ent a
very fair Abby. It is Situate upon a very
high Mountain, between the Canton of <HI>Zu|rich,</HI>
and that of <HI>Solure.</HI> The Papi&s;ts Flock
thither in Pilgrimage, from all parts of <HI>France,
Germany, Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> for the &s;ake
of a Miraculous Chapel, which is to be &s;een
in that place. The Hi&s;tory of it runs thus.
An Hermit having caus'd a Chapel to be
Built here, was at a lo&s;s to find a Bi&s;hop, who
would take the pains to come and Con&s;ecrate
it, in a place which was at &s;o great a di&s;tance
from the Commerce of Men: But on a cer|tain
Night as he was at Prayers, he &s;aw Je&s;us
Chri&s;t coming down from Heaven, accompa|nied
with his Ble&s;&s;ed Mother, the Virgin <HI>Ma|ry,</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="134">
the Twelve Apo&s;tles, and an infinite mul|titude
of Angels. All this Heavenly Compa|ny
entred the Chapel, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t com|manded
the Sacerdotal Habits to be brought
forth, which the Angels immediately deliver'd
to him, and were all enrich'd with Pearls and
Diamonds. He took them all from their
Hands, and put them on, repeating the Pray|ers
which the Prie&s;ts are oblig'd to &s;ay, whil&s;t
they put on the Sacred Habit. Ob&s;erve here
by the by, that in one of the&s;e Prayers, the
Prie&s;t Prays, that <HI>God would be plea&s;ed to ex|tingui&s;h
in him the Carnal Concupi&s;cence, that
reigns in his Members,</HI> and apply this if you
can, without the highe&s;t Sacrilege, to Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, who is the Eternal Purity. Our Savi|our
then having put on his Sacerdotal Orna|ments,
went and Con&s;ecrated the Chapel,
and afterwards the Altar; in performing
which, he ob&s;erv'd all the Ceremonies, made
all the &s;igns of the Cro&s;s, perform'd all the
Sprinklings of Holy-Water, di&s;patch'd all the
Anointings with the Holy-Oils, and pronou|ced
all the Prayers, which are &s;et down in
the <HI>Roman</HI> Ritual, for the Con&s;ecration of
Chapels, and Altars; the Apo&s;tles all this
while a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, and an&s;wering <HI>Amen</HI> to
all the Prayers, at the &s;ame time that the An|gels
Sang the Mu&s;ick, played upon In&s;tru|ments,
and in a word, made &s;uch a melodious
Con&s;ort, that the poor Hermit, who took a
View of all this, from one of the Corners of
<PB N="243" REF="134">
the Chapel, was wholly charm'd and ravi&s;h'd
with it. After that the Ceremony of Con&s;e|cration
was thus fini&s;h'd, Je&s;us Chri&s;t would
needs al&s;o Celebrate the fir&s;t Ma&s;s there, and
having put on the re&s;t of the required Or|naments,
he went to the Altar; S. <HI>Peter</HI> and
S. <HI>Paul</HI> Mini&s;tred to him at the Ma&s;s. The
Hermit took notice that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not
omit the lea&s;t Ceremony, Benediction, Kneel|ing,
or Prayer, that are contain'd in the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Mi&s;&s;al. This done, he took the Commu|nion
him&s;elf under both kinds, and afterwards
delivered it to his Ble&s;&s;ed Mother, and all the
Apo&s;tles, concluding the Ma&s;s with an <HI>Ite mi&s;|&s;a
e&s;t,</HI> to which the Angelical Con&s;ort an&s;we|red
<HI>Deo Gratias.</HI> When all this was thus per|form'd,
Je&s;us Chri&s;t together with all this Hea|venly
Society return'd to Heaven, leaving
the Chapel Con&s;ecrated, as it is at pre&s;ent.
We are to take notice that this hapned at a
time, when Men believed Hermits upon
their bair Words, and when the living in a
Wood, or upon a Mountain, with a &s;winging
Cowl upon ones Head, pa&s;t for an inconte|&s;table
proof of Saint&s;hip. The Hermit writ
to the Bi&s;hop, that now he needed not to in|commodate
him&s;elf to come and Con&s;ecrate
the Chapel, &s;eeing that Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf,
had been plea&s;ed to &s;ave him that trouble.
The good People, who at that time were the
Inhabitants of tho&s;e Mountains, and who
would have Swallow'd any thing, under the
<PB N="244" REF="135">
notion of a Miracle, gulp'd down this al&s;o.
This Chapel is to be &s;een there to this day,
whole and entire, and the <HI>Benedictins,</HI> who
have taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Place, have Built
a great Church round about it, &s;o that the
Great one, enclo&s;eth the Le&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fathers are very Rich, and have got
together a very great Trea&s;ury of Plate, by
means of this Devotion. And fora&s;much as
they are almo&s;t on every &s;ide, &s;urrounded
with Hereticks, (&s;o they call the Prote&s;tants;)
they make u&s;e of abundance of Precaution,
and do not &s;hew their Trea&s;ure to all the
World. They have enclo&s;ed it within a dou|ble
Wall, to the end that in ca&s;e of a Civil
War, the Prote&s;tants, might not be able to
find it. Near to the Abby, there is a fair Vil|lage,
very well Built, and the out&s;ide of all
the Hou&s;es are Painted, which makes a very
fine &s;hew. They are almo&s;t all Inhabited by
Inn-Keepers, who are furni&s;hed with excellent
Wine, which is a &s;trong Magneti&s;m for the
<HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Pilgrims.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks of this Country,
glory &s;o much in having got &s;o convincing a
Proof of the truth of their Ma&s;s, that they
openly declare, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t having fore|&s;een
the fatal Revolution, which of late hath
hapned in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> by the perver&s;e Do|ctrin
of <HI>Calvin,</HI> denying the real pre&s;ence of
the Holy Sacrament, was plea&s;ed beforehand
to Condemn this Doctrin, by his own offering
<PB N="245" REF="135">
up to his Eternal Father, the Bloodle&s;s Sacri|fice
of the Holy Ma&s;s, with all the Ceremo|nies,
the Holy Church of <HI>Rome</HI> makes u&s;e of.
It is to be &s;uppos'd that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was
greatly plea&s;ed to find in the <HI>Roman</HI> Mi&s;&s;al,
all tho&s;e finical Additions, the Popes have
joyned to it; and e&s;pecially with the invention
of tho&s;e pretty little Ho&s;ts, to the compo&s;ition
of which there enters more Wax than Flower.
I have frequently &s;een the&s;e Wafers made,
and I have &s;ome time for Recreation made
them them my &s;elf. They grea&s;e the Wa|fer-Iron,
in which they make the Ho&s;ts, with
white-Wax, to make them the more firm.
This Wax being melted, Penetrates the Wa|fers
through and through, and &s;erves for a
Glew to hold them together. This was it,
our Adorable Lord and Saviour thought not
of, when he in&s;tituted his Sacrament; but
however approved very well of this new In|vention,
in Celebrating the Ma&s;s at <HI>Encylas.</HI>
The <HI>Memento</HI> for the Dead, that is, the Pray|ers
for the Souls in Purgatory, which they
have in&s;erted into the Ma&s;s, plea&s;ed him al&s;o
extraordinary well: And &s;eeing it cannot be
doubted, but that his Prayers were a&s;&s;uredly
heard; it will follow, that there was not &s;o
much as one Soul left in Purgatory that day.
I have forgot to ask the&s;e good Catholicks,
whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t when he &s;aid Ma&s;s at
<HI>Encylas,</HI> gave the Communion to his Ble&s;&s;ed
Mother and his Di&s;ciples, under both kinds?
<PB N="246" REF="136">
Or whether he conform'd him&s;elf to the
Modern Practice of the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI>
who communicate the People under one kind
only; if they affirm this Latter, I prote&s;t I
have taken the Re&s;olution never to believe
them; and I will rather believe, that Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, who is the Eternal Wi&s;dom, had di&s;|po&s;ed
all things &s;o wi&s;ely, in his In&s;titution
of the Sacrament, that as there wanted no|thing
that might be added, &s;o neither was
there any thing &s;uperfluous to be taken away
from it. He would that all &s;hould Eat of the
Bread, and Drink of the Cup. <HI>Bibite ex eo
omnes: Drink ye all of it.</HI> This hath been the
con&s;tant Practice of the Primitive Church,
for many Ages; and I am &s;o far from look|ing
upon this fir&s;t Church, as being very de|fective
in all her Practices, as the Papi&s;ts would
fain per&s;uade us, that I &s;hall always con&s;ider
it, as the True and Perfect Pattern and Mo|del
of the Church, which our Lord and the
Apo&s;tles have left us, which we cannot under|take
to mend, without &s;poiling it, and from
which we cannot depart without Sin. Some
ancient Churches, even of tho&s;e that follow
the Communion of <HI>Rome,</HI> have in &s;ome &s;ort
pre&s;erved the ancient Cu&s;tom of Celebrating
the Lords Supper, tho' they look upon it on|ly
at pre&s;ent, as one of the Ceremonies of
the Holy-Week, and they practi&s;e it only on
Munday and Thur&s;day, but with &s;everal Ex|ce&s;&s;es
and Indecencies, which ought to be re|trenched
and put away.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="136">
I will give you a Relation here of what I
have &s;een practis'd at <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> where
I hapned to be for Two years together on
<HI>Holy-Thur&s;day.</HI> This Day, after Morning-Service,
and the Wa&s;hing of Feet, the Arch|bi&s;hop,
the Great Canons, and all the other
Prie&s;ts that &s;erve in the Cathedral, go in
Proce&s;&s;ion to a Great Hall, that is near the
Church, which they call the <HI>Chapter-Hou&s;e,</HI>
there to Celebrate the Supper. The Seculars
that are of any Rank and Quality, have leave
to enter with the re&s;t. There are great Benches
placed round about the Hall, where all the
Company &s;eat them&s;elves, and a great Table
in the mid&s;t, covered with a Table-Cloth,
upon which are placed large Cups or Goblets,
with other Pitchers and Ve&s;&s;els full of Wine,
and a va&s;t quantity of great Wafers divided
into Pounds and half Pounds. The Arch|bi&s;hop
being Arrayed in his Pontifical Habits,
reads with a loud Voice that part of the
Go&s;pel, which contains the Hi&s;tory of the
Supper; and afterwards ble&s;&s;ing the Bread
and the Wine, he declares, That they are to
take this in memory of the Pa&s;&s;ion of our
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to be obedient to the
Command he has left us, to <HI>do the &s;ame in Re|membrance
of him.</HI> Thus after having taken
his part of the Wafers, which is of two or
three Pounds, becau&s;e of his Dignity, he goes
and di&s;tributes the re&s;t, to all tho&s;e that are
pre&s;ent, a Service of one Pound to every
<PB N="248" REF="137">
Grand Canon, and of half a Pound to all
the re&s;t, the &s;ame &s;hare being given to me
al&s;o. They &s;pread a great Napkin before all
tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Supper, and every one
applies him&s;elf to eat the&s;e Wafers, which are
very thick, and of another &s;ort than tho&s;e
are, that they u&s;e at Ma&s;s. Formerly they
gave to all the Company pieces of Unlea|vened
Bread; but the&s;e Wafers were in
After-times found more plea&s;ing to the Palat,
and more fit to be Pre&s;ented. The Arch|bi&s;hop,
in the mean time, takes the Cup, or
rather, it is held to him, whil&s;t he drinks;
for it is &s;o large and &s;o full of Wine, that
two of the Canons are &s;carcely able to &s;upport
it. After he hath drunk, he &s;ends it to be
pre&s;ented to the Great Canons, and then to
all tho&s;e that &s;it on the Benches. They don't
amu&s;e them&s;elves with letting down a little
Gulp only, as is done at the Sacrament; but
they drink in good earne&s;t, and fetch the
greate&s;t Draughts they can: And there be
&s;ome of the&s;e <HI>German</HI> Gentlemen, that drink
above a Quart at a Draught; &s;o that the
Cup, as big as it is, is neverthele&s;s &s;oon
emptied, and mu&s;t be filled anew. The Wine
that is u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, mu&s;t be of the
be&s;t Rheni&s;h Wine that is to be got in all
the Territory of <HI>Mentz;</HI> and the Officers of
the Cathedral, have power to go and chu&s;e
it that Day with great Ceremony in the
Electors Cellars. They pierce all the Ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="249" REF="137">
one after another, and take the Judgment of
&s;ome Learned Palats upon them. It is the
high Opinion they have conceiv'd of the
goodne&s;s of this Wine, that makes the&s;e
Gentlemen drink &s;o heartily. The Great
Cup takes its Round five times, and &s;o oft
every one of the Company drinks. But if
any one &s;hould chance in the&s;e Intervals, to
be tormented with Thir&s;t, he needs only to
make a &s;ign to the Prie&s;ts, who are near to
the Table, where other Ve&s;&s;els &s;tand ready,
in which they are pre&s;ently &s;erved: Whil&s;t
the Cup goes round, the Singing-Men and
the Mu&s;icians &s;trike up their Notes and Sing,
(&s;tanding near the Table which holds the
Cups and the good Wine) that which the
Papi&s;ts call <HI>Improperia,</HI> which are the Re|proaches
our Saviour made to the <HI>Jews</HI> for
their Ingratitude, in Abu&s;ing him to that
degree as they did, notwith&s;tanding all the
Benefits they had received of him.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd, that the Company kept them|&s;elves
in a great degree of Re&s;traint and
Mode&s;ty at the fir&s;t and &s;econd Round the
Cup made; but at the third Turn, when the
good Wine began to di&s;play its virtue, every
one began to Talk and Laugh; and the
Singing-men, who were willing to take their
&s;hares of the good Wine, made Stops ever
and anon, to refre&s;h them&s;elves with the
plea&s;ing Liquor; &s;o that towards the end of
the Ceremony they were quite gon, and
<PB N="250" REF="138">
knew no longer what they &s;ung. I was pretty
near one of the Grand Canons, and told him;
<HI>In truth, My Lord, I am a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee them
&s;uffer the&s;e Singing-Men, to act all the&s;e Fooleries they
do in the mid&s;t of the Hall, and in your Pre&s;ence;
and at a Function, which requires a great deal
of Mode&s;ty and Seriou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He An&s;wer'd me
very fiercely; <HI>We do not concern our &s;elves with
tho&s;e Men; they are a Company of pure Rogues,
they de&s;erve indeed, to have their Legs and Arms
broke; but all that can be &s;aid for them is, that
they are drunk, and to &s;peak truth, I am &s;omewhat
engag'd that way my &s;elf.</HI> I found that he
&s;poke Truth, for the good Wine had &s;eiz'd
his Capitol, as well as tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the
Company. My Ho&s;t, with whom I lodged,
who was one of the Officers of the Grand
Chapter, return'd from thence very much
out of order, and own'd to have drunk above
&s;ix Quarts for his own &s;hare. He often call'd for
Wine extraordinarily, under pretence that the
bits of the Wafers which he eat, &s;tuck in his
Throat. At la&s;t, when the Ceremony was
ended, which la&s;ted about two Hours,
every one returned to his own Home, &s;taggering
as they went, and running their Heads again&s;t
the Walls. The Gentlemen certainly would
be highly di&s;plea&s;ed, if they &s;hould be de|prived
of the Cup that Day; and I que&s;tion
whether the Pope, with all his Authority
would ever be able to bring it about.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="138">
Now if we &s;et a&s;ide the Exce&s;&s;es, the Inde|cencies,
and &s;ome other Improperties the&s;e
Men did commit in this Solemnity; &s;ure it is,
that this is the true way of Admini&s;tring the
Holy Supper, which has been continually
pre&s;erv'd in this Church. It &s;eems probable,
that &s;ometime or other they were in the belief,
that they could not &s;atisfie the Command of
the Supper, by celebrating the Ma&s;s, and
Communicating in the manner as they do;
and therefore to remedy this in &s;ome degree,
they retain'd this Ceremony, which they call
the <HI>Lord's Precept;</HI> but &s;urely they then ob|&s;erved
it with more mode&s;ty and re&s;pect than
they do at pre&s;ent. Indeed, I know no Function
the Papi&s;ts have, throughout the whole cour&s;e
of the Year, that repre&s;ents the Holy Supper;
for what I have now &s;aid of <HI>Mentz,</HI> is not
practis'd in any other of their Churches. I
know they commonly a&s;&s;ign <HI>Ea&s;ter-Day</HI> for
this purpo&s;e; but I can find nothing in the
whole Office of that Day, that repre&s;ents any
thing of it: For the Ma&s;s hath no confor|mity
at all with the Supper; and be&s;ides, the
People do not Communicate whil&s;t the Ma&s;s
is celebrating, but after the Ma&s;s is ended,
and then the Prie&s;t, without making any
Prayer, and without declaring what he is
about to do, goes and puts into the Mouths
of all tho&s;e that pre&s;ent them&s;elves, a &s;mall
Con&s;ecrated Wafer, and &s;aith to every one
of them; <HI>The Body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t pre&s;erve thy
<PB N="252" REF="139">
Soul to Life Eternal.</HI> Every one that has Re|ceived
it, retires to a Corner of the Church,
to Pray in private; and then every one goes
home, without the lea&s;t Prayer made in com|mon.
Where therefore is the common Uni|on,
or Communion in all this? They can|not
&s;ay, that they partake all of one Bread,
for all the little Wafers they give are di&s;tinct,
&s;ome Old, and others New; &s;ome of them
bought at one Shop, and &s;ome at another,
and all of them (as was &s;aid) are &s;o pene|trated
with Wax, that it is hard to &s;ay whe|ther
it be Bread or Wax. They do not &s;o
much as once know, for the mo&s;t part, that
this Action is to be performed in remem|brance
of the Pa&s;&s;ion and Death of our Sa|viour
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, neither is there &s;o much
as one only word mention'd to put them in
mind of it. For my part, I mu&s;t acknowledge
that I knew nothing of it, before that I
began to &s;tudy Divinity; and I believed,
that to Communicate, was only to Receive
the Body of our Saviour, without being
obliged to call any thing to Remembrance.
And yet, this is that which is mo&s;t expre&s;ly
declared in the Commandment of our Sa|viour,
in the In&s;titution of the Holy Supper;
<HI>Do this in Remembrance of me.</HI> And tho&s;e who
Admini&s;ter the Sacrament, have an Engage|ment
lying upon them, <HI>to declare the Death of
our Lord,</HI> to make us remember it.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="139">
Notwith&s;tanding that the&s;e various Rela|tions
and Ob&s;ervations that I give you here,
&s;eem to have no great Connexion with my
Journy to <HI>Naples;</HI> yet they do very well com|port
with the General Subject I have pro|pos'd
to my &s;elf, and which I may well call
the main &s;cope and aim of my Work; which
is, to di&s;cover to you the re&s;t of the Corrupt
and Super&s;titious Practices of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> which are come to my knowledge.
I produce them one after another, according
as I find occa&s;ion; and in this regard, I
readily acknowledge this Treati&s;e not to be
very Regular: For, becau&s;e the mo&s;t part of
the&s;e Matters have no great Connexion toge|ther,
and that they cannot make out a whole
Chapter, or a Days Entertainment, I have
been obliged to follow this Method, tho'
&s;omewhat Irregular, not being able to order
things better.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Days Journy with an
Ob&s;ervation I made in my Journy from <HI>Mola</HI>
to <HI>Capua,</HI> which is this: Having &s;truck out of
the High-Way, we entred into &s;ome Little
Villages, to refre&s;h our &s;elves. Whil&s;t they
were Watering our Hor&s;es, we took a Turn
to &s;ee the Hou&s;es, and after what manner the
Poor People liv'd there. Their Hou&s;es are a
Company of Little Holes, I believe the
large&s;t of them was not above twelve Foot
in length, but kept very Neat. We were
<PB N="254" REF="140">
a&s;toni&s;h'd at the prodigious quantity of Wo|men
we found in them; but we &s;aw no Men
there, except only &s;ome few that were very
Ancient, the re&s;t being gone to their La|bour.</P>
<P>All the Old Women came out of their
Hou&s;es, carrying in their Hands Sau&s;ages,
and little Loaves of a kind of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Corn,
which they call <HI>Fromenton,</HI> and &s;ome dry
Figs. They de&s;ired us to give them our
Ble&s;&s;ing, and to accept of their Pre&s;ents.
We took &s;ome of their Figs, and the&s;e good
People took this for a great Favour at our
Hands. Some of them among&s;t the re&s;t,
pray'd us to come into their Hou&s;es, that
we might Ble&s;s &s;ome of their Wine, Water,
or Goats-Milk. We asked what they in|tended
to do with it afterwards? They told
us, It was to give their Husbands to drink,
when they return'd from their Labour all
on a Sweat, that it might do them no pre|judice.</P>
<P>I &s;aid to my Companion, That I could not
but admire the Faith of the&s;e People: Who
reply'd, That he took them all for Saints.
One of the&s;e good Women that over-heard
him, &s;ent forth a deep Sigh, &s;aying, <HI>That
for her part, &s;he was no Saint; but as for her
decea&s;ed Mother, that certainly &s;he had been one:
For &s;he Prayed to God from Morning to Night,
for the Souls of Purgatory, and always kept her
Hou&s;e well-&s;tor'd with good Provi&s;ions, for the
<PB N="255" REF="140">
Monks and Prie&s;ts that pa&s;&s;ed by that Way.</HI>
I que&s;tion'd them about &s;ome other Duties of
Chri&s;tianity, and &s;ome Chief Articles of our
Faith, wherein I found them very Igno|rant;
and &s;ome of them An&s;wer'd me, <HI>That
their Curate was a very Learned Man, and
that he would &s;atisfie us concerning the&s;e Points.</HI>
I found by this, that the&s;e Poor People were
arrived at that Ble&s;&s;ed Ignorance and Sim|plicity,
to which the Prie&s;ts of the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> would &s;o fain reduce the whole
World, if it were in their Power. So we
returned to our Hor&s;es in the Inn, which
we found had been well look'd to; we were
&s;erved al&s;o with very good Wine, and when
we demanded what we had to Pay, they
would take none of our Mony, our Ho&s;t
telling us, <HI>That we were Knights of Je&s;us
Christ, and that we had too much honoured him,
by coming under his Roof.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we were Mounting on Hor&s;e-back,
a Foot-Boy came to de&s;ire us to &s;tay one
Moment; for that Count <HI>Ludovica</HI> his Ma|&s;ter
de&s;ired, if it might be acceptable to us,
to have our Company to <HI>Capua.</HI> Our Ho&s;t
a&s;&s;ured us, That he was a very vertuous
good Lord. So we &s;tay'd for him, and Tra|vell'd
together to <HI>Capua.</HI> We told him of
the Simplicity and Charity of the Poor
People of the Village where we Baited. He
&s;aid, That <HI>they were us'd to it, and that in all
the Villages at any distance from the High-Way,
<PB N="256" REF="141">
they were all of the &s;ame Temper; and that
the Monks and Prie&s;ts took care to direct their
Cour&s;e that Way, when they Travell'd, to &s;pare
their Mony.</HI></P>
<P>Being Arrived at <HI>Capua,</HI> the Count Invited
us to accept of a Lodging with him, where
we were very Nobly Entertain'd, with a
Genero&s;ity and Open-heartedne&s;s, which is
not very common among&s;t the Noblemen of
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Fifth Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>THis Day, which was the la&s;t of our
Journy, was the mo&s;t Trouble&s;om
to us of all the re&s;t, becau&s;e it was
a Fa&s;t of the Church. We return'd our
Acknowledgments to our Noble Count, who
had &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;o generous and &s;plendid
in his Entertainment of us; and pro&s;ecuted
<PB N="258" REF="142">
our Journy to <HI>Aver&s;e,</HI> which is a very plea|&s;ant
and delicious City, &s;ituate between <HI>Capua</HI>
and <HI>Naples.</HI> We met with nothing con&s;ide|rable
on the Way, with relation to my Sub|ject;
only we ca&s;t our Eyes upon &s;ome Little
Chapels, which we found almo&s;t at the End
of every Field. The&s;e Chapels are no more
than &s;o many Little Vaults, four or five Foot
long, and three or four Foot broad; and en|tring
in, we found they contain'd the Picture
of a Crucifix, or of &s;ome Saint or other, who
are &s;uppos'd to be the Tutelar Saints of tho&s;e
Grounds, on which the Chapels are built.
We &s;aw in mo&s;t of the&s;e Chapels, Little Stones
hanging upon the Walls, being fa&s;tned with
Thred; as al&s;o Little Bones, &s;mall Tufts of
Hair, bits of Wood, &s;hreds of Cloth, and an
hundred other things of like Nature. We got
&s;ome of the Pea&s;ants, who quitted their La|bour,
to come and receive our Benediction,
to unfold to us the meaning of the&s;e things.
They told us, <HI>That they were the Vows of &s;ome
of the good Country People, according to the dif|fernt
Occa&s;ions or Dangers they had been in.</HI>
Some of them that had caught Falls, as they
were going on their Way, had gather'd up the
Pebbles, or Flints, at which they had &s;tumbled,
and carried them to the Chapel: Others had
brought thither the Sticks wherewith their
Ma&s;ters had beaten them: Women that had
Quarrel'd and Fought together, very devoutly
carried thither the Hair they had plucked
<PB N="259" REF="142">
from one anothers Heads. The&s;e good People
believing, by a Super&s;tition, whereof I had
never before &s;een an In&s;tance, that by com|mitting
the In&s;truments of their Mi&s;hap to
&s;ome one of the&s;e Chapels, they prevent the
hapning of the like Accident for time to
come.</P>
<P><HI>It may be &s;ome will Object to me here,</HI>
That I have been very diligent, in my Travels,
to take Notice of &s;ome incon&s;iderable Trifles, which
were not once worth the ob&s;erving; and now
make u&s;e of them, to reproach and mortifie the
Papists.</P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer, That if it may pa&s;s
for a kind of Excu&s;e, to produce the Example
of others that have done the like, I can a&s;&s;ert,
there are &s;ome who have made Remarks of
much le&s;s Importance, than is this I have la&s;t
mention'd. Father <HI>Mabillon,</HI> that Famous <HI>Be|nedictin,</HI>
in the Hi&s;tory of his Travels, gives us
a Relation of certain Women in <HI>Rome,</HI> who
creep up the Steps of the Portal of S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s
Church on their Knees; and makes this goodly
Reflection upon it, <HI>That this is &s;ome Remainder
of the Piety of the Emperour</HI> Theodo&s;ius, <HI>and of
his Veneration for that Augu&s;t Cathedral.</HI> In the
mean time we find, that it is not only in their
Approaches to this Magnificent Temple, that
the&s;e Women put them&s;elves into the&s;e Po|&s;tures;
but that they al&s;o u&s;e the &s;ame in their
Drawing near almo&s;t to every Place, where
any Super&s;titious Wor&s;hip is in Vogue; for I
<PB N="260" REF="143">
have &s;een both Men and Women &s;huffling on
their Knees, to the&s;e little Chapels built in the
Fields, whereof I am now &s;peaking, where
there is nothing con&s;iderable, that de&s;erves
any Veneration. Should a Papi&s;t be the Re|lator
of the&s;e Actions, he would not fail to
exalt them to the Clouds, and &s;et them forth as
mo&s;t Signal In&s;tances of an extraordinary Piety
and Devotion, and as Actions very Merito|rious
in the &s;ight of God; whereas, a Prote&s;tant
in giving an Account of them, would rather
deplore the Blindne&s;s of this Poor People, who
are &s;o ignorant of the true Ways of Salvation,
as to believe, that by employing them&s;elves in
this kind of Practices, they go &s;trait to Heaven,
and that by this means their Sins are blotted
out, without having recour&s;e to &s;erious Repen|tance.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Father <HI>Mabillon</HI> makes mention
of the Clo&s;e-Stool, or Chair, with a Hole in
it, called <HI>Sedes Stercoraria,</HI> on which formerly
the Popes were carried, after their Exaltation
to the Throne of S. <HI>Peter.</HI> He puts an Expli|cation
upon it, which I &s;uppo&s;e was &s;carcely
thought of at that time. He &s;aith, <HI>This Cere|mony
was made u&s;e of, to put the Popes in mind,
after their Election, that they ought to keep them|&s;elves
humble in the mid&s;t of that Greatne&s;s, to
which God had been plea&s;ed to rai&s;e them, as from
the Du&s;t and Dunghil, alluding to that of the
P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> P&s;al. 113. 7. <HI>De Stercore erigens Paupe|rem.</HI>
Some Writers, whom this Author terms
<PB N="261" REF="143">
<HI>Hereticks,</HI> give a very different account of it,
and &s;ay, <HI>That this kind of Chair was made u&s;e
of in the Ceremony of the Papal Exaltation, ever
&s;ince they had been Impos'd upon by Pope</HI> Joan,
<HI>as a nece&s;&s;ary Precaution, to prevent the like
Mi&s;take for the time to come: For they made the
Pope to Seat him&s;elf in this Chair, which after|wards
they held Lifted up on High, till all the
Cardinals had perform'd their Scrutiny concerning
the Holy Father, Whether he was furni&s;h'd with
all the Con&s;titutive Parts of a Perfect Man.</HI>
'Tis hard to determine, whether of the&s;e two
Explications be the true one. However, the
Abolition they have &s;ince made of this Cere|mony,
might make one &s;u&s;pect, that there
was indeed &s;omething in this Action, that
did not comport with the Glory of the Heads
of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> or el&s;e, that the
Popes have renounced tho&s;e humble Thoughts
of them&s;elves, which this <HI>Clo&s;e-Stool</HI> might
&s;erve to in&s;pire them with. I have Read in
the Books of Travellers, many other Ob&s;er|vations,
which in dignity do not in the lea&s;t
out-vy tho&s;e which by times come to my mind,
and which I hear relate to you, rather for
the Con&s;equences which may be drawn thence,
or for the Reflections they may occa&s;ion, than
for the importance of the Matters of Fact
them&s;elves.</P>

of it, I mu&s;t put you in mind, that the <HI>Itali|an</HI>
Dames are kept up, wor&s;e than Slaves, to
that degree, that they have not &s;o much as the
liberty of the Rooms of their own Hou&s;es.
In the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Cu&s;tom is to
lock them up in the Garrets, which for that
rea&s;on, they call the Womens Apartment.
Whenever they have a mind to buy any
thing, that is Cry'd along the Streets, or to
give an Alms to any poor Body, they have
Baskets, which they fa&s;ten to a great Rope,
and let them down to give or receive what
they plea&s;e. A Fryer <HI>Carmelite</HI> who was ma|king
his Que&s;t (a genteel word to expre&s;s Beg|ging)
in honour of the little <HI>Scapulary,</HI> was
waiting under the Window of a Dame of
Quality, for the de&s;cent of &s;ome Alms; the
Gentlewoman it &s;eems having too great a kind|ne&s;s
for him, to &s;end him away empty, con|veigh'd
down to him in her Basket a great
white-Loaf, which the good Fryer was reach|ing
out his Arms to receive; when two <HI>French</HI>
Men coming by, that were almo&s;t Fami&s;h'd,
prov'd more nimble than he, and di&s;appointed
him of his Prey, for the one of them having
<PB N="263" REF="144">
rudely thru&s;t the Fryer to the over-&s;ide of
the Street, the other laid hold upon the Basket,
and having taken out what was in it, they
both betook them&s;elves to their Heils. The
<HI>Carmelite,</HI> who was &s;en&s;ible of his Guilt, and
was therefore very de&s;irous of getting the
Loaf into his own hands, fell a running after
them with all his might, Crying out, Stop
the Thieves, &s;top the Thieves. Whereupon
the People &s;oon &s;topt them, as &s;uppo&s;ing that
they had Robb'd &s;omething con&s;iderable; but
the&s;e poor Wretches gave good Evidence, that
it was nothing le&s;s than Nece&s;&s;ity had put
them upon this Piece of Thievery, for with|out
being mov'd or skar'd at the Uproar
made about them, he who had Stolen the Loaf;
broke it in two, and gave the one half of it
to his Companion. As this was doing, &s;ome
Papers dropt out of it upon the Street, which
an <HI>Italian</HI> immediately &s;natch'd up, and the
<HI>Carmelite,</HI> who till then had expre&s;t &s;uch ear|ne&s;tne&s;s
to have his Loaf back again, &s;lipt away
through the Crowd, without making any fur|ther
enquiries concerning it.</P>
<P>Every one of the Spectators, were curious
to know the Contents of the&s;e Papers, and the
<HI>Italian</HI> to avoid the Throng of People, retired
to one of the Chambers of the Inn, where
we were, for to read it. After that he had
read it by him&s;elf, he was willing to Com|municate
it to all, for a notable Piece of Gal|lantry,
that de&s;ir'd to hear it. There were
<PB N="264" REF="145">
two Letters, the one enclos'd in the other,
whereof the one was the Fryer <HI>Carmelite</HI>'s
Letter, and the other contain'd the Ladies
An&s;wer. We heard both of them read, but
I am not able to repeat the Contents of them
to you word for word; therefore &s;hall only
mention tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions I more particular|ly
took notice of, for the Amorous Gallantry
they contain'd. Their Cu&s;tom in <HI>Italy</HI> is to
demand Alms, for the honour of the Mother
of God, that is, the Holy Virgin, according|ly
this Devout Fryer began his Letter with
the&s;e words: <HI>Anima devota della grand Madre</HI>
Venere, <HI>fatemi la Carit&agrave; povero Fraticello, deh per
piet&agrave; datemi un &s;qu&aacute;rdo, un ri&s;o, un bacio, qua|lehe
co&s;etta, par l' amor del Dio</HI> Cupido. In
Engli&s;h thus: <HI>Devout Soul of the great Mother</HI>
Venus, <HI>give an Alms to a poor Fryer; vouch&s;afe
to me I pray you for Charity, a Look, a Smile,
a Ki&s;s, &s;ome little thing or other, for the &s;ake of
the God</HI> Cupido. At the bottom of his Letter,
he de&s;ir'd the Lady, that &s;he would be pleas'd
to honour him with a word in An&s;wer, and
to &s;end him back his own Letter, as well to
&s;et his Heart at re&s;t, in that regard, as that
&s;he might not be expos'd to a Surprize of her
Husband. The Letter had no Name to it,
and concluded with the&s;e words, <HI>the poorest
of all your Lovers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="145">
<HI>The Ladies An&s;wer had an Air of Galan|try
no whit inferiour to that of the Fryers;
&s;he told him,</HI> That if he had demanded any Fa|vour
of her, &s;he would before have de&s;ired him
to inform her of his Rank and Quality; but &s;ee|ing
that he only demanded an Alms, every one
might without aba&s;ing them&s;elves afford that to
the mo&s;t poor and mi&s;erable. That tho' &s;he had
had no opportunity of taking a view of him, other|wi&s;e
than from the Garret Window, where &s;he was
Impri&s;on'd, yet that her &s;ight was good enough to
di&s;cern he had a very good Countenance under his
Hood, and that &s;he allow'd him from that very
moment, to &s;tudy the be&s;t means of getting to her,
provided that it were done with all po&s;&s;ible Precau|tion.
That &s;he might indeed have Burnt the Let|ter
he had &s;ent her, but that &s;he &s;uppos'd it would
have been an ill Pre&s;age, to Condemn to the Fire
the fir&s;t Fruits of his Love towards her; and that
&s;he doubted not, &s;ince he had been &s;o circum&s;pect
in the &s;ecuring of his own Letter, but he would
be at lea&s;t as careful for the An&s;wer &s;he &s;ent him,
that it might never fall into the hand of her Ty|rant,
<HI>(meaning her Husband:)</HI> She concluded
with the mo&s;t tender Expre&s;&s;ions, that could be in|vented
by the mo&s;t ardent Affection, and de&s;ired
the Fryer not to fail of returning the next day, at
the &s;ame Hour, to make his Quest; a&s;&s;uring him,
that he might build upon her Charity.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="146">
Tho' the&s;e Letters &s;eem'd to be Plea&s;ant
enough, yet the mo&s;t Under&s;tanding and
Virtuous of tho&s;e who heard them read, could
not but expre&s;s &s;omething of Horror, to &s;ee
Wickedne&s;s covering it &s;elf with the pretext
of Godline&s;s, and Stalking up and down in
the Di&s;gui&s;e of a Habit &s;o Holy in outward
appearance. They &s;ent out &s;ome Per&s;ons by
&s;everal ways, to look for the Fryer, but they
could not meet with him; only they Learnt,
at a Hou&s;e where he had Lodg'd, three or
four days before, that he was one of the great
Convent of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in <HI>Naples,</HI> and
that he had been &s;ent to make Que&s;t in the
Countries round about. My Companion, who
had &s;ome Letters to deliver to the Fathers of
the &s;aid Convent, took upon him to inform
the Prior of the whole matter, as &s;oon as we
&s;hould be Arriv'd there, if they would deliver
to him the Letters of this Fryer Que&s;tor.
The Letters were accordingly deliver'd to
him by the <HI>Italian,</HI> after that he had fir&s;t ta|ken
a Copy of them. That which favour'd
the Lady in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, was, that the two
<HI>French</HI> Beggars, who had minded nothing but
the Prey they long'd for, and who after they
had &s;eiz'd it, had run three or four Streets
to &s;ave them&s;elves from the Pur&s;uit of the
<HI>Carmelite,</HI> could by no means find out the
Hou&s;e again of this Charitable Creature, nei|ther
was there any <HI>Italian</HI> found, that was in
the humour to own it for his Wives hand.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="146">
This Hone&s;t Gentleman my Companion did
not fail two or three days after his Arrival at
<HI>Naples,</HI> to acquit him&s;elf of his Commi&s;&s;i|on;
but he received nothing but Frowns and
Di&s;plea&s;ure for his Pains; for having acquaint|ed
the Prior of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> with it, they
flatly denied that any Fryer of their Convent
had been &s;ent upon the Que&s;t to <HI>Aver&s;e</HI> at
that time; yea, they abu&s;ed him with ill
Language, asking him by what Authority he
had charged him&s;elf with this Commi&s;&s;ion,
as if it were the Office of Prie&s;ts to take cog|nizance
of the doings of Fryers? That they
were &s;ure, the Prie&s;ts had no rea&s;on for their
parts, to reproach their good Manners, &s;ee|ing
they them&s;elves led &s;uch very Loo&s;e and
Scandalous Lives.</P>
<P>The good Gentleman, &s;eeing that the Pri|or
began to be in a great Pa&s;&s;ion, and fear|ing
le&s;t the Religious might think fitting
to give him the Di&s;cipline for his Pains,
made his humble Excu&s;es to them, and with|drew
him&s;elf, &s;aying, that what he had done
in this Matter, was not in the lea&s;t done with
any intention to In&s;ult them; but only becau&s;e
he thought him&s;elf bound in Charity to ad|vertize
them of a thing for which they were
&s;o much reproached at <HI>Aver&s;e,</HI> and which
probably they might find out &s;ome means to
remedy. The Prior accordingly, notwith|&s;tanding
the bad Humour he was in, did not
fail of &s;ending the very &s;ame day, the Stew|ard
<PB N="268" REF="147">
of the Convent to <HI>Aver&s;e,</HI> with Or|ders
dexterou&s;ly to divulge there, that the
Fryer Que&s;tor, who had plaid the&s;e gallant
Tricks, did not belong to their Mona&s;tery,
and that in all probabilty, it mu&s;t have been
&s;ome Secular, that had made bold with their
Habit, the better to act his Part.</P>
<P>It is true enough, that &s;ometimes Seculars
Di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves in the Habits of Fryers,
to accompli&s;h their Ends, as knowing that no|thing
can be invented more proper to give
them a free acce&s;s to all Hou&s;es: For not|with&s;tanding
that the Men of the World are
daily Trappand by the&s;e wretched Monks,
yet for all that they retain as great a re|&s;pect
for their Habit, as for the mo&s;t Sacred
thing in the whole World; and the Monks,
that on their &s;ide, they may not be wanting
to the daily encrea&s;e of this Veneration,
&s;carcely Preach up any thing el&s;e but the Sa|credne&s;s
of their Habits. Therefore it is
that the&s;e Habits, by the great e&s;teem Men
have of them, are &s;o very Proper and ac|commodate
to Cloak all manner of Wicked|ne&s;s
and Trea&s;on, and con&s;equently are made
u&s;e of, to facilitate the e&s;cape of Criminals,
to Murther People in their Hou&s;es, to main|tain
&s;ecret Corre&s;pondencies in Cities, for to
Burn and betray them; and in a word, to
commit Adulteries, Ince&s;t, all manner of
Cheats, and Per&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s, Murthers, and
Sacriledge; yea, what is more, to attempt the
<PB N="269" REF="147">
Sacred Lives of Kings, whereof we meet with
too many fatal In&s;tances in Hi&s;tory. A <HI>Turk,</HI>
to whom the Prince of <HI>Mirandula,</HI> gave a
Relation of the different Religious Orders,
there were in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and who
(as he &s;aid) were the Ornament of it; Reply'd,
That if there was but one of them, they
would be &s;ufficient to exterminate all the
Princes of the Earth. It &s;eems he had Read
&s;omething of our Hi&s;tories. So many dreadful
<HI>Cata&s;trophes</HI> which daily happen by the&s;e pieces
of Cloth, &s;hap'd after an Antick manner, and
ridiculous Figure, one would think might be
&s;ufficient (if there were no other Rea&s;on for it,
but the Con&s;ervation of their States) wholly
to cut them off from the Church; for Religion
and the State ought to be &s;o perfectly united,
that the one may not betray the other, nor
give occa&s;ion to any Di&s;&s;en&s;ion or Mi&s;under|&s;tanding
therein. Whereas it is true in the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that they would &s;ooner
trample upon a Royal Robe, than upon the
Frock of a Monk; becau&s;e this Habit in it
&s;elf, tho' it may be he that wears it may be
oft-times wor&s;e than the Devil him&s;elf, is ac|counted
mo&s;t &s;uperlatively holy.</P>
<P>They call <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Country of Monks,</HI> not
only upon the account, that <HI>Monks</HI> (under
which Word I comprehend all the Religious)
do live very happily there, and have made,
as it were, their Paradice of it; but al&s;o
becau&s;e all the <HI>Italians</HI> are in &s;ome degree
<PB N="270" REF="148">
Monks. Tho&s;e who have not been of their
Number during their Lives, will at lea&s;t be &s;o
after their Deaths. They &s;pecifie in their La&s;t
Wills, the Religious Habit in which they will
be Buried; One will be dre&s;t up like a <HI>Bene|dictin,</HI>
another like a <HI>Carmelite,</HI> and &s;o for the
re&s;t. When the Bodies of any of the&s;e are
Carried to the Ground, their Biers and Coffins
are uncovered, that every one may &s;ee them
dre&s;t in their Mona&s;tick Habits, whereas the
Biers of other Per&s;ons are always covered.
The Monks tell us, That it is an Honour due
to their Habits, that nothing can interpo&s;e
betwixt them and Heaven; becau&s;e they have
the virtue of immediately uniting to that place
of Bli&s;s.</P>
<P>A Wax-Merchant at <HI>Venice,</HI> who had Cut
his own Throat, becau&s;e having bought up a
great quantity of Wax, the Price of it
chanced to fall &s;ome Days after, had Breath
enough left him, after the Wound given, to
declare, That he would be Buried in a <HI>Capu|cin</HI>'s
Habit; and &s;oon after died thus in De|&s;pair.
His Relations therefore executed his
La&s;t Will, and I &s;aw this Wretch carried
through the Streets in his <HI>Capucin</HI> Dre&s;s, with
his Throat Cut: Now I would fain know,
Whether his Accoutrement had the virtue of
immediately uniting him to Heaven. Externals
have to that pitch gain'd the A&s;cendant in the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that true Vertue &s;eems wholly
bani&s;hed from it.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="148">
We departed from <HI>Aver&s;e,</HI> as &s;oon as we had
Dined, and we Arrived (without putting our
&s;elves or our Hor&s;es much to it) timely enough
in the great Suburbs of <HI>Naples.</HI> The Gentle|man
with whom I was in Company, did
not think him&s;elf in an Equipage good enough,
to enter the City that Day; and I, becau&s;e I
would not leave him, took up my Lodging in
an Inn of the Suburbs with him. The Ho&s;t
was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the fir&s;t thing he demanded
of us was, Whether we were Fa&s;ting? We
told him, That we had Dined at <HI>Aver&s;e;</HI> and
the Gentleman's Servant had acquainted him,
that we had been very well Treated. How|ever
my Companion, who was not us'd to
Travel, and who found him&s;elf weary with
his Journy, gave Orders for a Supper to be
made ready, and under the pretext of his not
being very well, he would have them get &s;ome
fre&s;h Eggs for him. The Ho&s;t very obligingly
promis'd to get all things ready; but when
Supper-time was come, we found nothing but
two bits of Bread upon the Table, and &s;ome
Fruit. My Companion &s;ent word to the Ho&s;t,
to have the re&s;t of the Supper &s;ent up, with
the fre&s;h Eggs; who came him&s;elf to return
him an An&s;wer, which was to this purpo&s;e,
<HI>That he wi&s;h'd the Gentleman to call to mind, that
it was a Fa&s;t-Day, and that being a Clergy-Man,
he was oblig'd (more than any one el&s;e) to give a
good Example; and that in keeping his Fa&s;t, he
would at the &s;ame time perform two Duties, the
<PB N="272" REF="149">
fir&s;t in keeping the Fast; and the other by not
offending any one.</HI> This Clergy-Man, that was
not u&s;ed to be reprov'd by Seculars, who ordi|narily
dare not Reproach Men of their Coat,
came to great Words with the Ho&s;t, and told
him, that he had good Friends enough at
<HI>Naples,</HI> that would make him repent of his
In&s;olence: The Ho&s;t, on the other &s;ide, threat|ned
him with the Inqui&s;ition, &s;aying, <HI>That he
knew no rea&s;on why he might not be put there, as
well as his Wife, who had lain there already three
Years, for having eaten a little piece of Chee&s;e on
a Fa&s;t-Day, when &s;he was Big with Child; and
that &s;he had been Inform'd against by two Prie&s;ts,
who had Lodged in his Hou&s;e, and had committed
there all manner of Exce&s;&s;es.</HI> We perceiv'd very
well, that our Ho&s;t was tran&s;ported with a
very violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore we thought
fit to change our Inn, notwith&s;tanding that it
was very Late. Fora&s;much as I had had no
manner of Quarrel with him, he did in a
manner Excu&s;e him&s;elf to me; prote&s;ting to
me, <HI>That for the &s;pace of Twenty two Years that
he had kept an Inn, he never had &s;een &s;o much as
one Prie&s;t or Monk that kept the Fasts of the
Church; tho' they made a great Crime of it, to
tho&s;e poor Seculars that were Convict of that
Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="149">
Becau&s;e this Adventure has put me upon
mentioning the Fa&s;ts of the Papi&s;ts, I &s;hall take
occa&s;ion truly to declare to you, after what
manner they ob&s;erve their Fa&s;ts in the Church
of <HI>Rome;</HI> and enquire, Whether their Practice
be &s;o evident a Mark of the Purity and Holi|ne&s;s
of their Communion, as they pretend.
The Fa&s;ts Commanded by the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> under the Penalty of Mortal Sin, and
other Cha&s;ti&s;ements Corporal and Pecuniary,
are, <HI>Lent,</HI> the <HI>Quater Temps,</HI> or <HI>Four Times,</HI>
and the <HI>Vigils</HI> or <HI>Eves.</HI> As for the time of
<HI>Advent,</HI> they leave it to every ones liberty, to
Fa&s;t or not, according as their Devotion or
Inclination &s;ways them. The Ab&s;tinence from
Meat is in&s;eparably joyn'd with all their
Fa&s;ts; for the Papi&s;ts do not believe, that
any Fa&s;t can be truly kept without ab&s;taining
from Fle&s;h-Meat; and they &s;uppo&s;e this to be
the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential part of a Fa&s;t. In tho&s;e
Countries where the Inqui&s;ition is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
tho&s;e who break their Ab&s;tinence, may fall
under the Rigor of that Tribunal; but in
other Countries, the Bi&s;hops of every Dioce&s;s
have Power to puni&s;h Spiritually and Corpo|rally
tho&s;e that Tran&s;gre&s;s this way. More|over,
every Prie&s;t in particular is obliged, at
Confe&s;&s;ion, to impo&s;e upon them &s;ome Puni&s;h|ment,
equivalent to the Breaking of their
Fa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="150">
Now the&s;e for the mo&s;t part are Pecuniary
Mulcts, becau&s;e by this means they &s;erve two
Ends, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Mortifying their Peni|tents,
and of Grea&s;ing their own Fi&s;ts. As
for Example, They will order a Per&s;on, who
hath fail'd of Fa&s;ting in any one Day of
<HI>Lent,</HI> to put a Crown into the Pari&s;h Trunk
or Che&s;t, and &s;o proportionably if they have
Tran&s;gre&s;t oftner. The Prie&s;ts from time to
time take care to empty the Trunk, and
divide the Mony among&s;t them&s;elves. Infants
and Old Men, at a certain Age, are exempt
from Fa&s;ting, but not from the Ab&s;tinence
from Meat; and none are excu&s;ed from Ab|&s;tinence
and from Fa&s;ting, &s;ave only &s;uch as
are Sick; and they al&s;o mu&s;t have an Atte&s;ta|tion
in Writing, under the Hand of a Phy|&s;ician,
that they are really and truly &s;o; and
upon this Atte&s;tation, they grant them a Per|mi&s;&s;ion
to Eat Meat, and con&s;equently not
to Fa&s;t. There be &s;ome Butchers particularly
Appointed to &s;ell Fle&s;h on tho&s;e Days, with
&s;trict Orders, Not to &s;ell any Meat, except
to tho&s;e only who have &s;uch a Permi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Here it is we may take Notice, how hearty
the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> are in the Ob&s;ervance
of their Fa&s;ts, whereof they boa&s;t &s;o much;
for it may be a&s;&s;erted of a Truth, that above
three Fourth Parts among&s;t them get the&s;e
Permi&s;&s;ions from their Phy&s;icians and Curates,
without any real need, and only for &s;ome
<PB N="275" REF="150">
pretended Sickne&s;&s;es, which indeed they are
not afflicted with; or el&s;e, they make the
mo&s;t of &s;ome little Indi&s;po&s;itions they are
&s;ubject to by times, to excu&s;e them from the
trouble of Fa&s;ting. The Phy&s;icians are obliged
to take their words for it, and the Curates
refer them&s;elves to the Phy&s;icians. The Cu|rates
are a&s;&s;ured, That the more there be
of &s;uch Per&s;ons, who in this regard burthen
their Con&s;ciences, the more Mony they &s;hall
put into their Pockets at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> when their
Pari&s;hioners come to Confe&s;s to them. Thus
we may well &s;ay, That tho' the&s;e People
have paid their Butchers for the Meat they
had of them; yet it is not all paid, till they
have Talk'd with their Confe&s;&s;or, and &s;atisfied
his After-reckoning. As for what concerns
the Prie&s;ts and Monks, they take their Per|mi&s;&s;ions
from them&s;elves; and there be but
few Clergy-Men to be found, that keep <HI>Lent;</HI>
or in ca&s;t they do, it is with &s;uch Profu&s;ion
and Dainties of Fi&s;h, that makes their Ab&s;ti|nence
from Fle&s;h much more grateful, than the
<HI>Shro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">etide,</HI> which u&s;her'd it in. True it is,
that among&s;t the Seculars, there be found
many Poor People, who are not in a con|dition
of making the&s;e Expences, and who,
fearing to be too high Taxed by their Cu|rates
at <HI>Easter,</HI> are fain to Fa&s;t the whole
<HI>Lent</HI> out, not without a great deal of Trou|ble:
Which is the Rea&s;on of that Common
Saying among the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> that
<PB N="276" REF="151">
<HI>Lent is only for the Poor.</HI> La&s;tly, to &s;ay the
mo&s;t, If among&s;t the great Number of Pa|pi&s;ts,
that enjoy Plenty, there be &s;ome who&s;e
Con&s;ciences are tender enough, to put them
upon a Re&s;olution of Fa&s;ting, it is &s;till only
after the manner of <HI>Rome,</HI> which imports,
that they mu&s;t eat no more than Twice aday.
They take their Chief Meal at Noon, and
they may then without &s;cruple Eat as much
as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>A Doctor of Phy&s;ick, who had been at
Dinner in a Mona&s;tery, upon a Fa&s;t-Day,
told me merrily, That the&s;e Monks had made
him lay in Provi&s;ions enough for Three days,
he had &s;o &s;tuft his Belly among&s;t them. At
Evening they make a Collation, at which
they eat Fruits, Sweet-Meats, and other &s;uch
like things; and Fried-Fi&s;h, among&s;t other
things, pa&s;&s;eth for a Di&s;h that may be u&s;ed at
Collations.</P>
<P>The Ancient Cu&s;tom of the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> in their Fa&s;ts, was to Eat but once
aday, after Sun-&s;et, when Even-&s;ong was be|gun;
but fora&s;much, as this Practice did not
agree with the Delicatene&s;s of the Clergy,
the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks lighted on a plea&s;ant In|vention
to illude it; They formed an Office,
or Set of Prayers, which they called <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI>
or <HI>Even-&s;ong:</HI> And to the end they may ob|&s;erve
the Rule of not Eating till after Even-&s;ong,
they celebrate their Evening-Prayer in
the Morning.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="151">
Now if this be not very ridiculous, and if
this be not impudently to Mock at all manner
of Hone&s;ty and Sincerity, I leave you to
judge. Ju&s;t as if the Mini&s;ters of the Church
of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould go about to per&s;uade the
People, That for to eat their Suppers betimes
in the Morning, they need only to &s;ay their
Evening-Prayer very early.</P>
<P>The Fa&s;ts, as to the quality of the Viands
that are eaten, are very differently ob&s;erved
among&s;t the Papi&s;ts: In &s;ome Countries they
ab&s;tain from Eggs, Butter, and Chee&s;e; and
in others, they make no &s;cruple of Eating
them. In &s;ome Countries they expre&s;s a
very great di&s;ta&s;te of <HI>Lent.</HI> I Sojourned two
whole Years at <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the
Electoral Archbi&s;hop, the Fir&s;t Year di&s;|pen&s;ed
with the Ob&s;ervance of <HI>Lent</HI> through|out
all his Dioce&s;s, except only the Holy-Week,
or Week before <HI>Ea&s;ter;</HI> and the Se|cond
Year he Ordered, they &s;hould only Fa&s;t
three times a Week. They have a very plea|&s;ant
way of Fa&s;ting in <HI>Germany:</HI> After that
they have eaten a good Dinner in the Morn|ing,
they may (if they plea&s;e) Eat and Drink
all the re&s;t of the Day, as long as they eat no
hot Meat: They may eat Broth, Fi&s;h, Eggs, &amp;c.
&s;o they be but Cold before they fall upon them;
which is the Rea&s;on, why in <HI>Germany</HI> they
always take care, to have their Cupboards
well provided with Cold Meats in <HI>Lent</HI> time.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="152">
Again, there are other places where they are
as &s;trict and &s;crupulous in the ob&s;ervance of
<HI>Lent,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Countries that are un|der
the Dominion of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Prie&s;ts are
bound at <HI>Milan</HI> to Preach a Sermon at the
beginning of <HI>Lent,</HI> to take away tho&s;e Scru|ples
that may ari&s;e in the minds of the Peo|ple,
about Fa&s;ting and Ab&s;tinence. This
Sermon is always compos'd of Que&s;tions and
An&s;wers, much like the <HI>Athenian Mercury</HI>
we have here in <HI>London,</HI> and every one &s;ends
his Doubts to the Preacher, who re&s;olves
them the be&s;t he can. I once heard one of
the&s;e Ca&s;ui&s;tical Sermons in the Church of
S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> where abundance of very ridi|culous
Doubts were propos'd. Among&s;t other
things, the Que&s;tion was asked, <HI>Whether it
were lawful to eat Figs?</HI> And the difficulty
was, becau&s;e this Fruit contains a &s;ort of Milk
in it, whil&s;t it is green, which is turn'd af|terwards
into that &s;weetne&s;s which is found in
them, when they are fully Ripe; now all
&s;orts of white-Meats, that is, things made of
Milk are forbid in <HI>Italy:</HI> The Que&s;tion was
very Learnedly Re&s;olv'd in favour of the Figs,
and they were happily incorporated among&s;t
the <HI>Lent</HI> Viands, becau&s;e the Milky Juice in
the Figs contain'd no Cream or Fatne&s;s,
and becau&s;e neither Butter nor Chee&s;e could
be made of it: And he added this Corollary,
that upon the &s;ame account, Almond-milk
was a good and lawful <HI>Lent</HI> Meat, and that
<PB N="279" REF="152">
with it they might prepare their Rice-milk.
I lived for &s;ome time in a Mona&s;tery at
<HI>Milan,</HI> where three times a Week, we had
Rice-milk dre&s;t after this manner, which was
much more delicate, than if it had been
prepar'd with Cows-milk. The Learned Fa|ther
at la&s;t concluded this Que&s;tion, with
this &s;hamele&s;s Expre&s;&s;ion, That it was lawful
al&s;o to eat Mandrakes, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
Fruits did very lively repre&s;ent the Members
of Man and Woman. I beg my Readers
excu&s;e for making u&s;e of his own words.</P>
<P>Another Que&s;tion was, <HI>Whether at their
Evening Collations, they might dip their Bread in
Wine?</HI> The rea&s;on of the difficulty was, be|cau&s;e
according to the Rules of their Fa&s;ts,
they are not permitted to eat any <HI>Mene&s;tre,</HI>
that is, Pottage, at Night; and many believe,
that by dipping their Bread in Wine or Water,
they change the nature of Bread, and make
a kind of Pottage of it. I my &s;elf have
&s;een many Per&s;ons, who otherwi&s;e were ve|ry
&s;en&s;ible under&s;tanding People, who made
no difficulty of eating Bread and Fruit in
abundance in the Evening at their Collati|ons,
and to wa&s;h them down with two or
three Bottles of good Wine, who yet in the
mean time made a great &s;cruple to dip a bit
of Bread in Wine, and to eat it. But how|ever
the Que&s;tion was decided in favour of
the&s;e who did dip their Bread in Wine. He
back'd his Deci&s;ion with an Example very
<PB N="280" REF="153">
convincing to a Papi&s;t, and &s;uch as hit the
Nail on the head: When you receive, &s;aid
he, the Body of Chri&s;t in the Communion,
the Prie&s;t puts a little Wafer into your Mouth,
which immediately is penetrated throughout
with your Spittle; and yet the Faith teach|eth
you, that the Body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t re|mains
there &s;till, and that none of the Ac|cidents
are corrupted by the humectation
or penetration of the Spittle: In the very
&s;ame manner (&s;aid he) when you Sop your
Bread in Wine, this makes no change at all,
in that which you take, not a jot more than
if you &s;hould eat the Bread, and drink your
Wine &s;eparately, &s;o that you may for time
to come &s;afely do it without any &s;cruple.
In a word, this Father re&s;olved a va&s;t
number of Difficulties, that had been pro|pounded
to him, and which for the mo&s;t part
were of the &s;ame Stamp with tho&s;e I have
given you a ta&s;te of.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e we are &s;peaking of the Ob&s;erva|tion
of <HI>Lent</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> you may take notice,
that <HI>Lent</HI> begins there four days later, than
in all the other parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> by a Priviledge
they pretend to hold from S. <HI>Ambro&s;e.</HI> Now
for the&s;e four days, a va&s;t quantity of People
from all Parts of <HI>Italy</HI> repair thither, to enjoy
this Priviledge; and I have known Per&s;ons
that came above one hundred Leagues;
which &s;hews that there is a &s;trange Avidity in
the Papi&s;ts, to eat Fle&s;h at the time it is for|bid
<PB N="281" REF="153">
them. Now the&s;e days are no &s;ooner
ended, but all this Crowd makes as much
ha&s;te to get away from thence, as before
they made ha&s;te to get thither; the rea&s;on is,
becau&s;e afterwards the <HI>Quadrage&s;imal</HI> Ab&s;ti|nence
is ob&s;erved with much more rigour
and exactne&s;s at <HI>Milan,</HI> than in any other
part of <HI>Italy,</HI> excepting only tho&s;e, that have
Licences, which, as I have mentioned be|fore,
are always in great Numbers. If any one
be found that tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the Rules of the
<HI>Lent</HI> Fa&s;t, they are &s;ent immediately to the
Inqui&s;ition, and proceeded again&s;t as Here|ticks.
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will allow of no &s;lack|ning
of this Point, in tho&s;e Countries that
are &s;ubject to them. In the time when
<HI>Burgundy</HI> was under <HI>Spain,</HI> they ob&s;erved
the Fa&s;ts of the Church much more rigorou|&s;ly
than they do now, &s;ince it is under the
Dominion of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>An Officer of the great Chapter of <HI>Mentz,</HI>
gave me the Relation of a trouble&s;ome Ac|cident,
tho' the pa&s;&s;ages of it be very plea|&s;ant,
which hapned to him, and three of
the great Canons of <HI>Mentz,</HI> with relation
to Fa&s;ting. They had taken a view of the
greate&s;t part of <HI>France,</HI> and they returned to
their own Country through <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in time
of <HI>Lent.</HI> As they were Travelling from <HI>Dola</HI>
to <HI>Be&s;an&ccedil;on,</HI> this Officer hapned to kill a
great Hen in the Fields, and the Gentlemen
Canons having Congratulated his good Luck,
<PB N="282" REF="154">
re&s;olved to eat it at the fir&s;t Inn they &s;hould
come at. Being Arriv'd about Dinner-time,
at the fir&s;t Village they met with, they or|dered
a great Fire to be made in their Cham|ber,
and the Officer commanded them to
bring up a Kettle, without &s;aying what he
intended to do with it: Their Ho&s;te&s;s brought
them one, but being &s;eiz'd with a curio&s;ity
to know what u&s;e they would put it to; &s;he
&s;pi'd them &s;o well, that &s;he found they were
Boyling a Hen. Whereupon &s;he pre&s;ently
ran out of Doors and told her Neighbours,
who came all running away in Throngs, no
otherwi&s;e than if the Hou&s;e had been on
Fire. The Ho&s;te&s;s led them the way to the
Chamber of the&s;e Gentlemen, and in a fu|rious
Tran&s;port, demanded her Kettle again;
they de&s;ired her to have Patience a little, tel|ling
her that what they had put into it,
was almo&s;t Boyled; but the Woman in a
great rage, &s;natch'd the Kettle from off the
Fire, and the Officer forc'd it from her a|gain,
to have his Hen.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Neighbours all
came up at the Noi&s;e, and belching forth
the mo&s;t execrable Oaths, (which were far
wor&s;e than the breaking of the Fa&s;t,) threat|ned
the Gentlemen to kill them immediately,
if they did not render them&s;elves Pri&s;oners.
The&s;e Grand Canons, who were all of them
Lords of great Quality, in vain call'd up for
their Foot-Boys, dre&s;t in their rich Liveries,
<PB N="283" REF="154">
and put off their Riding Coats, which co|vered
their rich Silk Habits, and &s;hewed
them their Golden Cro&s;&s;es and the fair Me|dals
hanging about their Necks. The&s;e Vil|lanous
Pea&s;ants, in &s;pite of all they could &s;hew
or alledge, made them get on Hor&s;e-back,
and having bound them with Cords, in a
mo&s;t ignominious manner, they Conducted
them with a &s;trange Hue and Cry, car|rying
the Par-boil'd Hen ty'd to the top of a
Staff, before them, till they came to the City
of <HI>Be&s;an&ccedil;on,</HI> which was about Eight Leagues
from the Village, in&s;ulting over them with
a thou&s;and Affronts all along the Way, as if
they had been Hereticks.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were come into the City,
a va&s;t Throng of People came from all Parts
to &s;ee them, flinging Dirt and Stones at them,
and crying aloud, Burn them alive; Burn them
alive. They brought them in this Po&s;ture
&s;traight to the Archbi&s;hop, who being im|mediately
inform'd who they were, brought
them into one of the Dining-Rooms of his
Palace, and had very much ado to appea&s;e
the Rabble. After that he had &s;ignified to
them the Humour of the People of that Coun|try,
and the extream Danger to which they
had expos'd them&s;elves, he expre&s;t to them
the &s;en&s;ible Regret he had for the Affront
they had received, and &s;hewed them a thou|&s;and
Civilities, in Token of the Re&s;pect he
bore to the Canons of the mo&s;t Noble
<PB N="284" REF="155">
Chapter, that was in the whole Empire. And
the next day very early in the Morning,
he let them e&s;cape by a back Door, for fear
of their being Torn to pieces by the Rabble.
See here what an Extravagant Zeal for Su|per&s;titious
Ob&s;ervances is capable to produce;
neither Civility, nor Virtue, nor Rea&s;on, be|ing
able to gave Check to the furious Effects
thereof. Je&s;us Chri&s;t certainly never left us
any &s;uch Spirit, or any &s;uch Religion. It
wanted but very little of our falling into the
&s;ame Trouble, by the Imprudence of my Com|panion,
the Evening we Arriv'd in the Su|burbs
of <HI>Naples;</HI> and had they put us into
the Inqui&s;ition, it would have been much
wor&s;e with us.</P>
<P>I do not in the lea&s;t di&s;approve of Fa&s;ts;
but on the contrary think them to be both
commendable and u&s;eful for a Chri&s;tian to
Exerci&s;e them, e&s;pecially when accompanied
with Prayers and Alms-giving, for the humb|ling
of our Souls, and the &s;ubduing and &s;ub|jecting
our Bodies to the Spirit; that is, for
the Mortifying our Brutal Pa&s;&s;ions, which
commonly owe their force and vigour to a
healthy pamper'd State of the Body, and too
great Repletion; and to give the Spirit a
greater liberty and agility in the practice of
Virtue. Nay, what is more, I could wi&s;h
with all my Heart, that Chri&s;tians would ex|erci&s;e
them&s;elves by times alltogether, in this
good Practice, to the End of Encouraging
<PB N="285" REF="155">
one another by their good Examples, and by
their Union in &s;o good a Work, to draw
down upon them&s;elves the Heavenly Ble&s;&s;ing.
But I cannot by any means approve the
going about to force People to this Duty, by
the Confi&s;cation of all their Goods, by Tor|tures
and Fire, and by a mo&s;t pitile&s;s and
cruel Inqui&s;ition. I don't believe, that God
ever gave &s;uch Power to Men over one ano|ther,
as to proceed to &s;uch barbarous and
inhuman Con&s;traints; and tho&s;e who pretend
to &s;uch a Power, ought not to be called
<HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> but <HI>Robbers</HI> and <HI>Murtherers,</HI> who are
got into the Sheepfold only, to rob, de&s;troy
and kill.</P>
<P>The next Morning betimes we Entred the
City of <HI>Naples,</HI> where I made a Stay of
Three Weeks. I went to Vi&s;it the Great
Ho&s;pital for the Sick, which without doubt
is very well Admini&s;tred; neither is the Di|rection
of it in the Hands of Monks and
Prie&s;ts; but the Nobility of <HI>Naples</HI> have the
whole ordering of it. I was extreamly edi|fied
to &s;ee a Score of Gentlemen, Knights,
Earls and Marque&s;&s;es, who &s;erved there in
their Turns by Weeks, and who them&s;elves
carried Broth and Meat to the Sick, having
their great Rapiers by their Sides, after the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode, with a Neatne&s;s and Chear|fulne&s;s,
capable of alleviating the Maladies of
the&s;e poor Patients. The Apartment for Wo|men
<PB N="286" REF="156">
was up Stairs, who were &s;erved in the
&s;ame manner by Noble Matrons. I have
Vi&s;ited many other Ho&s;pitals in <HI>Italy,</HI> ap|pointed
for Sick-People, which were Go|verned
by Fryers, whom they call <HI>Brothers of
Charity;</HI> but never met with any thing that
might be compared with that of <HI>Naples.</HI>
The&s;e Monks are commonly very peevi&s;h and
cro&s;s, and frequently Abu&s;e the Sick with
Words and Stroaks, after having taken to
their own &s;hare, the be&s;t part of the Cha|rities,
that are &s;ent to the poor Sick. I could
not keep my &s;elf, upon a time, from &s;aying
to one of the&s;e Monks, who had Beaten one
of the poor Sick, That that Action of his
&s;truck me with Horrour. To Excu&s;e him&s;elf,
he told me, <HI>That I did not know that Sick
Per&s;on &s;o well as he did, and that he was one of
tho&s;e, who notwith&s;tanding that they are perfectly
Cured, do yet complain continually, only that they
may remain &s;till in the Ho&s;pital; and that to
make them weary of it, they were forced to Abu&s;e
them in this manner.</HI></P>
<P>They had none of all the&s;e ba&s;e and unwor|thy
Con&s;iderations in this Great Ho&s;pital of
<HI>Naples;</HI> on the contrary, they took Methods
quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e now mention'd, to
incline tho&s;e that were recovered to leave the
Ho&s;pital. Whil&s;t they are Sick, they are
kept &s;trictly to the Rules the Phy&s;icians Ap|point
concerning them, who direct the quan|tity
and quality of their Meat and Drink;
<PB N="287" REF="156">
which they execute with a punctuality that is
to admiration. Afterwards, when the Phy&s;i|cians
declare that they are wholly Cured, they
continue them there &s;till for Three Weeks,
and they are Treated Morning and Evening
with all &s;orts of delicate Viands, boyl'd and
roa&s;ted; and &s;erv'd with the choice&s;t Fruits
and be&s;t Wine, in &s;uch a quantity, as may
mo&s;t contribute to the &s;trengthning and nou|ri&s;hing
of them, without doing them any
prejudice. At the end of the Three Weeks,
tho&s;e that want Cloaths have them be&s;tow'd
upon them, and a piece of Mony be&s;ides;
and &s;o are &s;ent away. By this means there
is never a Poor Patient in the Ho&s;pital, but
wi&s;heth, that this Three Weeks time were
come for him too, to be &s;o Nobly Entertain'd:
And by this means, they are put to no trouble,
to di&s;charge their Ho&s;pital of tho&s;e who are
Recovered.</P>
<P>The Great Ho&s;pital of <HI>Milan,</HI> and &s;ome
others of <HI>Italy,</HI> are almo&s;t Admini&s;tred after
the &s;ame manner. I could wi&s;h the <HI>Italians</HI>
would be advi&s;ed, not to tru&s;t their Charities
to Prie&s;ts and Monks, &s;o much as they do,
who, for the mo&s;t part, have the mo&s;t pity|le&s;s
and inhuman Hearts that can be: For
indeed this is a Cur&s;e which God pours forth
upon them, for being the Authors of &s;o
many Idolatrous Practices and Profanations
they are guilty of; to give them a Heart as
herd and unrelenting, as that of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="157">
They would do much better, to take the
pains of di&s;tributing their Alms them&s;elves;
becau&s;e we find, that in tho&s;e Places where
they do &s;o, things are managed in &s;o noble
and generous a manner.</P>
<P>Having taken a View of the Ho&s;pital of
<HI>Naples,</HI> I &s;pent &s;ome part of my time to go
and &s;ee the Fair Churches of that great and
&s;tately City; which indeed are &s;uch, that
nothing can be &s;een more Rich, Magnificent,
or Beautiful: There is &s;carely the lea&s;t Pari&s;h
Church, which is not all Gilt and Painted
from the top to the bottom. All the Altars
and Chapels are built of Precious Stones; and
there is never a Church, but hath Silver-Candle&s;ticks,
Ba&s;ons, and Lamps in great
numbers, without counting the Shrines and
Ca&s;es for their Relicks and their Cro&s;&s;es,
that for the mo&s;t part are of pure Gold:
Which made a Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples</HI> &s;ay, <HI>That
if all the Churches of that City were made into
One, and that all their Riches made up but One
Trea&s;ury, it would by far &s;urpa&s;s in Beauty and
Riches the very Temple of</HI> Solomon; <HI>and that
by this means, there might be &s;een at this Day,
to the Honour of the</HI> Neapolitans, <HI>&s;omething more
glorious, than was that which in past Ages had
been the Admiration of all the World.</HI> For my
part, I do truly believe, that in making this
Imaginary Union of the Churches of <HI>Naples,</HI>
it would by far &s;urpa&s;s in &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s the
<PB N="289" REF="157">
&s;ame Union we might conceive of all the
Churches of <HI>Rome.</HI> Yet mu&s;t we not conclude
from hence, that therefore the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> are
the better Men; God having made it appear
two or three years ago, that he cares little for
the&s;e Material Temples, by permitting the
mo&s;t part of all tho&s;e fair and &s;umptuous
Churches, to be overthrown by a dreadful
Earthquake.</P>
<P>It would be much better in my Opinion,
to take away all the &s;uperfluous Ornaments of
Churches, and to turn them into a Stock,
for the Entertainment of the Poor of the
Pari&s;h, who are the Temples of the Holy
Gho&s;t, than to &s;tudy Night and Day, to
embeli&s;h Pillars and Dead-Walls. This with|out
doubt would be much more plea&s;ing to
God, than all the fair and &s;tately Fabricks
that could be built. It is &s;ufficient, that the
Places where we Meet to wor&s;hip God, be
decently Adorn'd, without any thing of &s;u|perfluous
Co&s;tline&s;s, and convenient for the
Faithful that A&s;&s;emble there; but it is the
holding forth of a fal&s;e Notion of Religion,
to go about to per&s;uade Chri&s;tians, as the
Popi&s;h-Prie&s;ts endeavour to do, <HI>That the more
lu&s;trous and dazelling their Churches are with
Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones; the more abun|dantly
the Holy Gho&s;t pours forth of his Graces
and Ble&s;&s;ings on them.</HI> One of the faire&s;t and
mo&s;t &s;umptuous Churches of <HI>Naples,</HI> was that
of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> &s;ave only that the Length of
<PB N="290" REF="158">
it was not an&s;werable to the Breadth of it;
and yet all Rich and Beautiful as it was, we
&s;ee the late Earthquake took no pity of it,
but in a manner totally overthrew it. This
probably will give an occa&s;ion to the Fathers,
to build another more proportionable, and
probably al&s;o more Rich and more Magni|ficent.</P>
<P>All manner of Monks and Religious live
generally very richly and plentifully at <HI>Naples,</HI>
and all of them have many Mona&s;teries and
Convents there of their own Order; but
none of them all are more Rich and Power|ful,
than the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> they are they that have
all the Nobility at command, who do no|thing
without them: 'Tis by their means
Men get into Places and Offices: There are
no Matches made, which they have not a
hand in; yea, they &s;toop &s;o low, as to take
care of furni&s;hing them with Men and Maid-Servants.
And indeed there is more Policy
in this la&s;t Point, than one would imagine.
We mu&s;t not be &s;o weak to think their Cha|rity
puts them upon the&s;e kind of Services,
but rather their own Intere&s;t; for by this
means they have con&s;tant Intelligence of
what&s;oever pa&s;&s;eth in all Families, and are
&s;ure of a Party, who will di&s;po&s;e all things
in favour of them, upon occa&s;ion. But if the
Per&s;ons thus placed, &s;hould chance in the lea&s;t
to di&s;oblige them, as they have found the
means of getting them in, &s;o they will &s;oon
<PB N="291" REF="158">
find a way to turn them out again: Which
makes, That the&s;e Servants, for the mo&s;t
part, had rather betray their own Ma&s;ters,
than to hazard the di&s;plea&s;ure of the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI>
as being a&s;&s;ured, That if their Ma&s;ters, at the
wor&s;t, &s;hould come to di&s;cover their Fal&s;e|ne&s;s,
that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> will either make their
Peace, or do their endeavour to &s;eek out for
them another Condition, that may be more
for their Advantage. But if they &s;hould
chance to offend the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> they had as
good go out of the World. All the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>
of <HI>Italy,</HI> for &s;ome Years &s;ince, have followed
the Model the Fathers of <HI>Naples</HI> have given
them, to place Servants and Maids; and
generally all tho&s;e that have a mind to enter
upon any Service what&s;oever. In&s;omuch,
that People go and Addre&s;s them&s;elves to the
<HI>Je&s;uits</HI> there, as here in <HI>London</HI> they go to
the Offices of Intelligence, with this di&s;tin|ction
only, That in&s;tead of giving a piece of
Mony, they oblige them&s;elves, to be their
Slaves for ever.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this great Acce&s;s
the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have every where, and that they
are &s;o Rich and Potent; yet it may be al&s;o
with Truth affirmed, that they are at this
day generally hated of all the World. The
Princes and Grandees have no further e&s;teem
for them, but as they fear to hazard the
ruining of their Affairs, &s;hould they once
offer to di&s;oblige them; but at the bottom,
<PB N="292" REF="159">
and in truth, they love them not. The
Common People al&s;o are very weary of
&s;eeing them&s;elves reduced to Slavery, under
the in&s;olent Domination of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who
Command them in the mo&s;t Imperious and
Servile manner that can be: And generally
all &s;orts of Prie&s;ts, Monks, and Religious, hate
them mortally, as being their greate&s;t Ene|mies;
and a &s;ort of People, that carry it
towards them with Loftine&s;s and Di&s;dain,
who have already deprived them of a great
part of their Temporal Revenues, and who
probably will find them&s;elves &s;trong enough
one day, to invade all the re&s;t. Some very
Intelligent Per&s;ons have Ca&s;t the Account,
that they have already u&s;urped near one half
of the Goods belonging to the Order of
S. <HI>Bennet.</HI> They make Kings and Princes
to grant them what&s;oever they plea&s;e, and
they are continually begging &s;ome Abbies
or Priories of S. <HI>Bennet,</HI> either to make Col|leges
of them, or to unite them to their
Profe&s;t Hou&s;es. What is more, they make
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of, and invade them with
the extreame&s;t In&s;olence.</P>
<P>I had a Letter &s;hewn me once, which the
Father Rector of the College of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>
of <HI>Clermont</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> writ to the Father
Prior of the Abby of S. <HI>Benignus</HI> of <HI>Dijon,</HI>
upon account of the Priory of <HI>Laris,</HI> which
did belong to tho&s;e Fathers, who are <HI>Bene|dictins,</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="159">
and which the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> had a mind to
get for them&s;elves; which runs thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have thought good to Unite the Priory
of <HI>Laris,</HI> which depends on your Abby,
to our College of <HI>Clermont,</HI> to augment the Re|venues
thereof: And fora&s;much as the Con&s;ent of
your Community is nece&s;&s;ary for this, we doubt
not but you will &s;hew all readine&s;s in giving the
&s;ame. You know that Father <HI>de la Chai&s;&s;e</HI> con|cerns
him&s;elf in this Matter, and the Power he
hath at Court, ought to affright you, from incur|ring
his Indignation by your Refu&s;al; &s;o that we
hope, that all things on your &s;ide will corre&s;pond
with our Wi&s;hes.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Reverend Father,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The <HI>Benedictins</HI> of this Abby having called a
Chapter, con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to be done;
but were &s;o terrified with this Threatning
Letter of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> that they ba&s;ely and
cowardly con&s;ented, that that great Priory
&s;hould be di&s;membred from their Abby, and
Incorporated with the College of <HI>Clermont,</HI>
as it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> are like to Drones, who enter
upon the Labours of others, and eat the Bees
Hony: They are the la&s;t come into the
<PB N="294" REF="160">
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet they are the fir&s;t
in Power, in numbers of Hou&s;es, and in
Riches. The great number of Colleges they
have, &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all belief.</P>
<P>And now I am &s;peaking of their Colleges,
it brings to my mind a very ingenious Epi|gram
which one of their Scholars made at
<HI>Dola</HI> in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of their
taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a College which they
have there, and is called <HI>l' Arc,</HI> or <HI>the Bow.</HI>
The <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> who was the Rhetorick Regent,
told his Scholars, That they knew very well
that the Famous College of <HI>la Fle&s;che,</HI> in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> belonged to the Fathers of the So|ciety;
and that now, by a wonderful and
Divine Providence, the Magi&s;trate of <HI>Dola</HI>
had be&s;towed upon them the <HI>Piazza</HI> and
fair Buildings of <HI>l' Arc;</HI> wherefore his Will
was, That they &s;hould endeavour every one
of them, to make an Epigram upon this &s;o
happy an Encounter, propo&s;ing a Reward to
him that &s;hould be&s;t acquit him&s;elf of the
Task. They accordingly, all of them, &s;et
their Wits upon the Rack to produce &s;omething
more than ordinary upon &s;o rare a Subject.
Some flatter'd them, That with this their
<HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Arrow</HI> (for this is the Engli&s;h of
<HI>l' Arc &amp; la Fle&s;che)</HI> they would &s;ooner or later
&s;ubjugate the World: Others applying it to
their Doctrin, &s;aid, That the <HI>Bow</HI> by its
&s;trength repre&s;ented the Solidity of it, and
the piercing Point of the <HI>Arrow,</HI> the Subtilty
<PB N="295" REF="160">
thereof: Others, that were greater Liars than
the re&s;t, or it may be al&s;o to Laugh at them
in their Sleeves, &s;aid, That the Piety and
Vertue of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> lifted them up to Hea|ven,
as the <HI>Bow</HI> doth the <HI>Arrow.</HI> But the
mo&s;t happy and lucky Wit of all was his,
who made this mo&s;t excellent pat Di&s;tick:
<Q><L>Arcum <HI>Dola</HI> dedit Patribus, dedit Alma Sagit|tam</L>
<L><HI>Gallia;</HI> quis Funem quem meruere dabit?</L></Q>
<Q><L>Fair <HI>France</HI> the Arrow, <HI>Dola</HI> gave the Bow;</L>
<L>Who &s;hall the String, &s;o well de&s;erv'd, bestow?</L></Q>
It's without Controver&s;ie, that the Scholar
who made this, had be&s;t de&s;erved the pro|mi&s;ed
Recompence; but in&s;tead thereof he
was &s;hamefully expell'd the College. For my
part, I wi&s;h neither Halter nor Death to
the&s;e Fathers, only I could wi&s;h, from a
Spirit of Chri&s;tian Charity, that they would
once &s;eriou&s;ly think of changing their Evil
Ways, and that they would not drag along
with them, as they do, &s;o many Thou&s;ands
down the way of Perdition. Or at lea&s;t, I
could heartily wi&s;h, they would give over the
Profaning the Holy Name of JESUS, by
appropriating it to them&s;elves. Of all the
Popes that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has had, there is
not one to be found, that ever dur&s;t take to
him&s;elf the Name of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> out of the
<PB N="296" REF="161">
re&s;pect they had to that Apo&s;tle; and yet
the&s;e Wretches have had the Effrontery, to
take to them&s;elves that of our Adorable Sa|viour,
in&s;omuch that I cannot name the
Name of JESUS, but the&s;e Wretches imme|diately
come to my mind. Yea, they are
the cau&s;e, why many People whom they give
occa&s;ion to Cur&s;e them, pronounce that Holy
Name mo&s;t Irreverently, mingling it with
the wicked Words and Revilings they be|&s;tow
upon.</P>
<P>I don't pretend to any thing of a Pro|phet;
yet dur&s;t I almo&s;t venture to Prog|no&s;ticate
thus much, That like as this Order
of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> hath in a very &s;hort time
rai&s;ed it &s;elf to a prodigious Greatne&s;s, &s;o it
won't be long, before it take a Fall equal
to its Elevation. Its own weight &s;hall &s;ink
it, <HI>Mole ruet &s;u&acirc;,</HI> and its Ruin &s;hall drag the
Di&s;&s;olution of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> along with
it. For then Peoples Eyes will be opened, to
&s;ee how &s;hamefully they have been abu&s;ed
and gull'd by a Company of Men, who
pretending to be the Pillars of the Church,
and profe&s;&s;ing the out&s;ide of Vertue, reje|cted
the Sub&s;tance thereof. God grant that
Athei&s;m may not thrive by the approaching
Wreck of that Church; but that all at that
time may terminate in a holy Reformation,
whereof the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath already
given &s;o perfect a Model.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="161">
The Je&s;uits are they who have the faire&s;t
and riche&s;t Churches not only at <HI>Naples,</HI> but
al&s;o throughout almo&s;t all the other parts of
<HI>Italy;</HI> and they are al&s;o the be&s;t Men of the
World, according to the Sen&s;e I have already
explained. After having taken a view of
their Colleges and Churches in this Noble
City, I had a favourable occa&s;ion offered me,
of &s;eeing the Relicks of S. <HI>Januarius,</HI> which
are kept in the Cathedral, and where the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks boa&s;t of having a perpetual
Miracle: For they &s;hew you a Vial full of
Blood, averring it to be that of S. <HI>January,</HI>
which as &s;oon as it is brought near to his
Body, turns to Liquor. The Reverend Do|ctor
<HI>Burnet,</HI> now Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> has, in
his Letters, given us his Opinion concerning
this Relick, which is very probable. As for
my part, tho' I was a Prie&s;t of the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet they did not &s;o far Honour me,
as to let me handle the Vial, that con|tains
the Blood, notwith&s;tanding my earne&s;t|ne&s;s
to obtain that favour. This indeed
made me &s;omewhat Su&s;picious of the Relick;
for if a Prie&s;t hath the Power and Authority
of handling the Body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the
Euchari&s;t after Con&s;ecration, he may very well,
I &s;hould think, be allow'd to touch all other
&s;orts of Relicks, which are &s;o far inferiour to
that. I imagined therefore, and not without
rea&s;on, that there might be &s;ome Concavities
in the Gla&s;s, which contain'd a reddi&s;h Li|quor,
<PB N="298" REF="162">
which the Prie&s;ts, who knew the Trick
of it, could when ever they pleas'd, cau&s;e to
be diffu&s;ed over the middle of the Gla&s;s.
They declare to all Per&s;ons that come to &s;ee
this Relick, that a Heretick was once Con|verted
at the &s;ight of this Miracle; &s;o
that here is now a Second Miracle pro|duced,
to confirm and prove the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;aw &s;ince at <HI>Milan,</HI> a Mini&s;ter of <HI>Ge|neva,</HI>
who was turned Papi&s;t at <HI>Turin,</HI> and
after that he had Travelled over all <HI>Italy,</HI>
and among&s;t the re&s;t had &s;een the Relick
of S. <HI>January;</HI> I asked him, What he
thought of it? He de&s;ired me in the Name
of God, not to &s;peak to him about it, for
fear it &s;hould rai&s;e tho&s;e thoughts in him,
that might encline him to turn Heretick a|gain:
For he told me, that when the Prie&s;ts
were about to &s;hew it him, they fell into
the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion imaginable, becau&s;e
the Spring of the Machin, would not Play;
but at la&s;t they &s;hak'd the Bottle &s;o long,
till they made a &s;hift to &s;hew him &s;omething,
that was Reddi&s;h and Liquid. He added
that another Mini&s;ter, who had abjur'd with
him at <HI>Turin,</HI> and who was there at the &s;ame
time pre&s;ent with him, prote&s;ted to him, at
their coming out of the Church, that for
his part he had &s;een enough, and was re|&s;olv'd
to return to <HI>Geneva.</HI> So that we &s;ee
here a Saint that is an Ambo-dexter, and
Works Miracles both ways, by making Pro|te&s;tants,
<PB N="299" REF="162">
turn Papi&s;ts, and the Papi&s;ts, Pro|te&s;tants.
The &s;ame Gentleman prote&s;ted to
me, that if he had no other Rea&s;ons to be|lieve
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion, that
Miracle would never have had the Efficacy,
to per&s;uade him of the Truth of it, as they
pretended it had done others.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o another Que&s;tion to ask of this
New-Papi&s;t, which was, <HI>How the Hereticks
liv'd at Geneva?</HI> Becau&s;e being a New-Con|vert,
and having been a Mini&s;ter there, I
hoped he would di&s;cover &s;omething Extraor|dinary
concerning their Practices. He told
me, that he could not tell me of any Super|&s;tititious
Practice that they had, nor of any
Fraud or wicked Action, that they Commit|ted,
to Engage the People to their Party;
and that almo&s;t all their publick Acts of
Religion, con&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e four things; the
Reading of the Holy Scripture, the Singing
of P&s;alms, Preaching, and Celebrating the
Lord's Supper. I prayed him al&s;o to tell me
&s;incerely, <HI>Whether what I had heard reported
of them, from my fir&s;t Youth, were true or no?</HI>
viz. <HI>that they have the Figure of a Devil in
their Churches? and that as &s;oon as the Sermon
is Ended, all the</HI> Hugonots <HI>went and Prostra|ted
them&s;elves before it, and Wor&s;hip'd it?</HI>
(This is that Story the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> &s;o often tell
to their Scolars, in their Schools, to in&s;pire
them with Horror again&s;t the Hereticks;)
His An&s;wer was, that it was a very great Lie,
<PB N="300" REF="163">
and that the <HI>Hugonots</HI> had &s;o great an Aver|&s;ion
for all &s;orts of Images in their Churches,
that they never &s;uffer'd any to be there;
neither of God, nor of the Angels, nor of
the Saints, nor of the Devil. So that it &s;eems
he could tell me nothing, that might give me
any Di&s;e&s;teem for the Prote&s;tants; but on
the contrary, he very much Dimini&s;hed the
fal&s;e Idea, they had given me of them. He
only declared, that the &s;ole Rea&s;on that
had inclin'd him to leave them was, becau&s;e
he believed their Doctrin not to be Sound,
and that they put a fal&s;e Interpretation on the
Scriptures. In a word, he did not believe,
&s;aid he, that their Divinity was good. But
indeed he could not &s;ay le&s;s, to make Men
believe he was a Papi&s;t.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince made this Reflection, that it
is &s;ome kind of Proof of the true Religion,
when tho&s;e who leave it, have nothing to
object again&s;t the Manners or Practices of
tho&s;e who profe&s;s it. I defie a Prote&s;tant that
leaves the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to turn Papi&s;t,
to Ridicule or Di&s;approve the lea&s;t Ceremo|ny
that is practi&s;ed in the &s;ame; for &s;hould
he do this, he mu&s;t either Scoff at the Preach|ing
of the Word, or the Common Prayers,
or the &s;inging of P&s;alms, or at the Commu|nion,
and this is that they cannot do, becau&s;e
the&s;e are Acts of Religion, which are practi|&s;ed
in the &s;aid Church, with an Exemplary
Devotion, and without any Super&s;tition at all.
<PB N="301" REF="163">
But the Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame, with tho&s;e who
Abandon the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> for they can
tell you a thou&s;and things that are in Vogue
there, the bare Relation of which, without
any the lea&s;t change or exaggeration, can|not
but excite the Di&s;e&s;teem or Indignati|on
of hone&s;t and good Men.</P>
<P>But to return again to <HI>Naples;</HI> after having
Vi&s;ited the Churches and Relicks, I had the
Curio&s;ity one Evening, to go and take a
Walk before the Haven, where three of the
Pope's Gallies were Arriv'd that day, and I
entred into all three of them, to &s;ee how
the poor Gally-Slaves were treated there.
I mu&s;t acknowledge that my Heart was not
Stanch enough to re&s;i&s;t the Motions of Com|pa&s;&s;ion
at &s;o pitiful a Spectacle. The Inhu|mane
Cruelty of the Ma&s;ters that beat them,
&s;urpa&s;&s;eth a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">y thing I can tell you of it.
I could not conceive how Chri&s;tians, could
have the Heart, to handle with &s;o much Ri|gour,
tho&s;e who were their Brethren in
Chri&s;t. 'True it is, I repre&s;ented to my
&s;elf, that all the&s;e were mi&s;erable Wretches,
that had been Condemned for their Crimes,
and that Crimes were to be Puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>As I was entertaining my &s;elf with the&s;e
&s;ad Thoughts, I ca&s;t my Eyes upon Three
of them, who &s;eemed to me to be New-Comers,
and who were all fa&s;tned to the
&s;ame Bench. One of the&s;e Three hid his
Face with his Hands, and another of them
<PB N="302" REF="164">
Beckned me to come to him. As &s;oon as I
was come near, he asked me, Whether I did
not know him? I could not of a &s;udden call
him to mind, becau&s;e they had cut his Hair;
and be&s;ides, his Gally-Slaves Habit had much
di&s;guis'd him: But having Ey'd him with
more attention, I knew him to be a Per&s;on,
who had been the Steward of a Cardinal at
<HI>Rome.</HI> He told me, <HI>That the two others, who
were of each &s;ide of him, were Monks, who had
left their Mona&s;teries, and had lived &s;ometime at</HI>
Rome <HI>Incognito, under a Secular Garb.</HI> The
Steward told me, <HI>He had been Accu&s;ed, of
having wi&s;h'd for the Death of his Ma&s;ter; and
the Cardinal &s;ometime after having found him|&s;elf
a little Indi&s;po&s;ed, he firmly believ'd, That
his Steward had Poy&s;on'd him.</HI> They a&s;&s;ured
me, all Three of them, That they had been
di&s;covered, or rather betray'd by means of
their Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>No Body at <HI>Rome</HI> knew, that the&s;e Two
unhappy Wretches were Monks; only the
Humor took one of them, to go to di&s;cover
him&s;elf in Confe&s;&s;ion, and to make mention
al&s;o of his Companion; and the very next
Day they were both of them &s;eized and &s;ent
to the Gallies, withou telling them why, or
for what. As for the Steward, he told me,
<HI>It was but a few Days &s;ince, that he had Con|fe&s;&s;ed
the &s;ecret Hatred he had against his
Master; and his Confe&s;&s;or, who was always
very Welcom at the Cardinal's Hou&s;e, had Informed
<PB N="303" REF="164">
him thereof; which made him interpret a &s;mall
Fit of the Colick, he had &s;oon after, to be an
effect of the Poy&s;on his Steward had given him;
and that upon this Cruel and Ill-grounded-Su&s;picion,
he &s;ent him, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Author
of it, to the Gallies.</HI> They all Three of them
wi&s;h'd earne&s;tly, That the Gally in which
they were, might be &s;hatter'd to pieces
again&s;t &s;ome Rock or other, or &s;ink-down to
rights in the Sea, fora&s;much as Death would
prove much more acceptable to them, than
the Slavery to which they were reduc'd: But
they prote&s;ted, That if by any other more
happy Accident they ever came to be &s;et at
Liberty, they would never hear of Con|fe&s;&s;ing
any more, nor of a pretended Secret,
which was never kept, and for which they now
paid &s;o dearly.</P>
<P>This had led us to a Point which is of a
very large extent, and wherein the Papi&s;ts
make one of the chief Parts of their Reli|gion
to con&s;i&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI>
Of all the Practices that in proce&s;s of time
have been introduc'd into the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> there is none at which I am more
a&s;toni&s;hed, than at this, and wherein the
Artifice of the Monks and Prie&s;ts hath been
more &s;ubtilly employ'd. There is nothing
more plea&s;ing to the World, than to know
the mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts, and the very bot|tom
of Mens Hearts; but on the other hand,
neither is there any thing which Men are
<PB N="304" REF="165">
more loath to impart to others, becau&s;e of
the Ill u&s;e may be made of it. The Angels
take an unutterable plea&s;ure mutually to com|municate
their Thoughts, and reciprocally
to receive this knowledge from each other;
fora&s;much as being confirmed in Grace, they
cannot hurt one another. But the Nature of
Man, &s;ince the mi&s;erable Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> is &s;o
extreamly corrupted, and his inclination to
Evil is &s;o great, that a man that &s;hould &s;peak
all he thinks, and all that he does, would
expo&s;e him&s;elf to a thou&s;and Dangers: Which
is the Rea&s;on why Secrecy, which in the
&s;tate of Innocency would have prov'd very
u&s;ele&s;s, is at this time, in this &s;tate of
Corruption, become a nece&s;&s;ary Vertue;
as being a main ground of his &s;ecurity and
&s;afety.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that a Per&s;on had the
power to penetrate into the Thoughts and
Hearts of others, how great an Advantage
might he draw thence, to further his own
Affairs? For if this Per&s;on were of an Am|bitious
Humor, it would be enough for him,
by his knowledge of other Mens Thoughts,
to Addre&s;s him&s;elf to &s;uch Men, as he knew
might be ea&s;ily gain'd to endeavour his Ele|vation.
If he was Covetous, he would only
Conver&s;e with tho&s;e whom he knew to be
of a Liberal Heart, and whom he might
ea&s;ily per&s;uade to gratifie him. If he were
addicted to &s;en&s;ual and infamous Plea&s;ures,
<PB N="305" REF="165">
he might, without ever fearing a Repul&s;e,
confidently apply him&s;elf to tho&s;e who had
the mo&s;t Lu&s;tful Inclinations. A Revengful
Per&s;on needed only to betake him&s;elf to tho&s;e
who were of a Bloody and Inhuman Temper,
to make them the Executors of his Revenge.
A General of an Army would not &s;tand in
need of Spies; but knowing all the De&s;igns
of his Enemy, he would be thereby In&s;tructed
how to order his own Actions and Conduct;
he might always be &s;ure of his Blow, and
could never be taken at a Surprize. Be&s;ides,
what a plea&s;ure and diver&s;ion it would be to
him, to tickle his Fancy with a thou&s;and
Maggots and fooli&s;h Thoughts, which conti|nually
flutter in the Heads of mo&s;t Men, and
which would be no le&s;s divertizing, than
the mo&s;t merry Comedies and ridiculous
Farces.</P>
<P>In a word, having con&s;idered all, we may
well a&s;&s;ert, That nothing would either be
more plea&s;ant or profitable, than this inti|mate
Knowledge of the Thoughts of Mens
Hearts. And this is the very thing the Prie&s;ts
and Monks of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> have in
&s;ome &s;ort procur'd to them&s;elves by means of
their <HI>Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> as they are pleas'd
to call it. To bring about this Advantagious
De&s;ign, they make u&s;e of the 23th Ver&s;e of
the XXth Chapter of S. <HI>John; Who&s;oever Sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and who|&s;oever
Sins ye retain, they are retained:</HI> And
<PB N="306" REF="166">
of Ver&s;e <HI>16th</HI> of the Fifth Chapter of the
Epi&s;tle of S. <HI>James; Confe&s;s your Faults one to
another:</HI> The former of which Texts they In|terpret
concerning the Power, they pretend
to have been given them, to pardon Sins; and
the other, of that Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion, which
they pretend mu&s;t be made to the Prie&s;ts.
At the fir&s;t, they Confe&s;&s;ed their Sins only in
General; or if they &s;pecified any, they were
&s;uch as had been Publick, and had given
Scandal to others; but, by little and little,
they have obliged Per&s;ons to Confe&s;s their
mo&s;t Secret Sins, and that with all the mo&s;t
particular Circum&s;tances thereto belonging.
Nay, be&s;ides all this, they will have Per&s;ons
Confe&s;s to them, all their Evil Inclinations;
that is to &s;ay, they will know where the
Strength or Weakne&s;s of a Per&s;on lies, before
he &s;hall get out of their Hands.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Que&s;tion they make to you at
Confe&s;&s;ion is, Who you are? Your Quality,
Condition, and Way of Living? Afterwards,
they ask, What you have done; the Place
where you committed the Sin; the Means and
In&s;truments you have made u&s;e of, to put it
in execution; the End you had in doing it;
the Manner of your Committing it; at what
Time, and with whom you have Sinned; and
how often you have Committed the &s;ame
Sin? In a word, a dextrous Confe&s;&s;or knows
&s;o well how to &s;earch and &s;ift his Penitent,
that nothing &s;hall e&s;cape his Scrutiny.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="166">
I &s;hould certainly make the Papi&s;ts Blu&s;h,
&s;hould I begin to relate here the Confe&s;&s;ion
of their Whores, and what Que&s;tions the
Prie&s;ts put to them; but I ble&s;s God, I have
not Impudence enough to undertake it; and
I &s;hould be very loath, to blot the Paper with
what the Prie&s;ts and Monks of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> make no Bones to mingle with their
Sacrament of <HI>Penance.</HI> I &s;hall only tell you,
That the avidity and eagerne&s;s wherewith the
Prie&s;ts &s;hew them&s;elves carried, to the Con|fe&s;&s;ing
of tho&s;e that are of the Female Sex,
make it very apparent, how much Plea&s;ure
they take in putting Que&s;tions to them, and
Hearing of their An&s;wers. They will di&s;|patch
a Man's Confe&s;&s;ion in le&s;s than Half an
Hours time; but if they have got a Hand&s;om-Woman
to Task, they will keep her in a
Confe&s;&s;ional-Chat two or three Hours toge|ther.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never forget a Stratagem, &s;ome
<HI>Je&s;uits</HI> Scholars made u&s;e of, to Tole their
Father Confe&s;&s;or to the Confe&s;&s;ing-Chair.
The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> oblige their Scholars, to Confe&s;s
them&s;elves every Holy-day or Fe&s;tival in the
Year, and that under the Penalty of being
Whipt, in ca&s;e of Neglect; &s;o that they per|form
this Duty rather out of Fear of Puni&s;h|ment,
than from any Spirit of Penitence and
Devotion. In the mean time the Confe&s;&s;ors,
who are appointed to take their Confe&s;&s;ions,
are not at all earne&s;t to di&s;charge that
<PB N="308" REF="167">
Function; but let their Penitents lie often four
or five Hours on their Knees in the Church,
before ever they come at them. The Scholars
had agreed to Play a Match at Tennice, as
&s;oon as they &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;t from Confe&s;&s;ion,
but did not know by what means to get
them&s;elves di&s;patch'd. The Fathers Confe&s;&s;ors
were all Playing at Bowls in their Garden,
and as often as any of the Scholars came to
ask for them, they were &s;ent away with this
An&s;wer, That <HI>the Fathers were engaged in
Meditation.</HI> At la&s;t, as they were pumping
for &s;omething that might relieve them, they
call'd to mind, that a pretty young Woman,
called <HI>Ali&s;on,</HI> &s;pent almo&s;t every Day three or
four Hours in the Confe&s;&s;ional with the Father
Rector; whereupon they deputed one of their
Company, to go and tell him, <HI>That Madam</HI>
Ali&s;on <HI>waited for him at the Confe&s;&s;ional.</HI> The
Father immediately left his Game at Bowls,
and ran all in a Sweat to his Confe&s;&s;ional;
where he found none but this Troop of young
Scholars, whom he did not much care to
Confe&s;s. Wherefore to rid him&s;elf of them,
he di&s;patch'd them a Great Benediction,
telling them, <HI>That he knew already what they
had to &s;ay, and that they had nothing but &s;ome
Scholars Sins to Confe&s;s to him, which did not
once de&s;erve a Formal Ab&s;olution;</HI> and &s;o &s;ent
them away very well &s;atisfied with his quick
Riddance. However, con&s;idering with how
much Expedition he had di&s;mi&s;t them, they
<PB N="309" REF="167">
&s;aid to one another; <HI>Well, certainly we have
great Rea&s;on to Ble&s;s God, that we have not &s;o
many Sins to Confe&s;s, as Madam</HI> Ali&s;on <HI>has;
for otherwi&s;e he would not have made an end
of Confe&s;&s;ing us all, till to Morrow Morn|ing.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis in the&s;e Confe&s;&s;ionals, that the Prie&s;ts
and Monks do Court their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. I once
chanc'd to find in one of the Sides of a Con|fe&s;&s;ional,
an Amorous Letter, which an <HI>Italian</HI>
Monk had writ to his Lady. An Old Woman,
who was come on purpo&s;e to Confe&s;&s;ion, to
receive the &s;aid Letter, had by Mi&s;chance
dropt it, as &s;he came out of the Confe&s;&s;ional.
The Letter was full of Wit: He told her,
<HI>That the greate&s;t Sin &s;he ever had committed in
her Life-time was, that &s;he had not been &s;o good
as her Word in coming to Confe&s;&s;ion that Week:
If this Neglect did proceed from the difficulty &s;he
found to Love him, he had a Penance ready Cut
out for her; which was to Command her to Love
him better.</HI> I don't remember the re&s;t of the
Letter; only thus much I can tell you, that
it was &s;tuft with nothing but Flouri&s;hes and
Love, and there was no Name &s;ub&s;crib'd to
it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have a quick Ear, and draw
near to the&s;e Confe&s;&s;ionals, do often hear
pretty Stories. There &s;ometimes happen great
Tumults in the Convents, and among&s;t the
Prie&s;ts, upon the account of young Women
Penitents: For if any of them do chance to
<PB N="310" REF="168">
change their Confe&s;&s;or, this Alteration cau&s;eth
great Jealou&s;ies, which many times are not
extingui&s;h'd, but by Poy&s;on, or with the
Blood of one of the Competitors; for they
pre&s;ently interpret it, as if the other Con|fe&s;&s;or,
had by his Artifices allured, and (as it
were) debauched his Penitent.</P>
<P>A Father <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> very Famous for his Ser|mons
at <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> de&s;ired me to
make his Peace with a Gentlewoman of Qua|lity,
who, for &s;ome time, had left off coming
to Confe&s;&s;ion to him. The Lady told me,
<HI>That &s;he was astoni&s;hed, to hear the Father talk
of making his Peace with her; that for her part,
&s;he had never had any the lea&s;t Quarrel with
him; and that the only Rea&s;on, why &s;he had not
Confe&s;t to him of late was, becau&s;e it was more
for her Convenience to go to the</HI> Carmelites, <HI>as
being nearer to her Hou&s;e.</HI> When I return'd
this An&s;wer to the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> his Colour chang'd
of a &s;udden, and he appear'd to be in a
&s;trange agitation of Spirit. In a word, a Fe|ver
&s;eiz'd him the &s;ame Night, and the Cha|ritable
Lady, for fear of giving any occa&s;ion
to his Death, &s;ent him word, <HI>That &s;he would
come and Confe&s;s to him for time to come.</HI></P>
<P>The greate&s;t Secret they have to allure La|dies
to Confe&s;&s;ion is, to be very Complai&s;ant
to them, to &s;ooth them with a company of
&s;weet Words, to te&s;tifie their loving of them
Tenderly, and from the Bottom of their
Hearts. Sometimes they find it very trou|ble&s;om
<PB N="311" REF="168">
at fir&s;t, to make them Confe&s;s as
they ought, that is, Clearly and Plainly with|out
any mincing of the Matter, and with all
the Circum&s;tances of &s;ome &s;hameful Sins, and
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Fle&s;h. They are fain
to take a great Compa&s;s, to bring them to
the Point, they would have them at; but by
little and little, and a great deal of Pains-taking,
they at la&s;t weather the Point, and make
them Impudent enough. Then it is they
a&s;&s;ure them, that they are Arriv'd at that Sim|plicity,
Purity, and Faithfulne&s;s, which are
of &s;uch ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, for the well Di&s;|charging
of the Duty of Confe&s;&s;ion. Hence
it is that tho&s;e Women who mo&s;tly frequent
the Confe&s;&s;ionals, and who are Arriv'd to
that degree of Perfection, I ju&s;t now men|tioned,
that is, to be le&s;s &s;hamefac'd than the
re&s;t, become al&s;o the mo&s;t bold and &s;hamele&s;s
in all Companies. They are got pa&s;t Blu&s;h|ing
at any thing, and with a great deal of
Freedom, make u&s;e of tho&s;e Terms their
Confe&s;&s;ors have taught them at their Confe&s;&s;i|ons.
I upon a time expre&s;t my &s;elf not over
well &s;atisfied with the Di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;ome
Devout or Bigotted Young Woman, had in
the Pre&s;ence of two Young Counts of the
Empire, who&s;e Governour I was. I took
the liberty to tell them, that it did not be|come
them; but they with a terrible Impu|dence,
which yet was accompanied with
&s;ome little Smartne&s;s of Wit, an&s;wered me,
<PB N="312" REF="169">
that they did not believe that they had &s;po|ken
&s;o unhand&s;omly, but that they were
ready to repeat the &s;ame Words in Confe&s;&s;i|on.
Indeed they have made it a School of
Impudence and La&s;civious Di&s;cour&s;e, where
tho&s;e that &s;peak Broade&s;t, and call a Spade,
a Spade, receive the greate&s;t Prai&s;es. They
are not afraid to tell them; Courage Madam,
the more clearly, and in the more proper
Terms you do expre&s;s your Self, by &s;o much
the more will you &s;hew your Sincerity to
God, who hears you, and the better I &s;hall
like you. To Facilitate this the more, they
have the&s;e Words writ on their Confe&s;&s;ionals
with great Letters, <HI>GOD HEARS THEE.</HI> It is
a thing that will Surprize a Man to &s;ee young
Girls among&s;t the Papi&s;ts, that know tho&s;e
things which they ought, by right, to be
ignorant of all their Life time, and all this
by means of Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is a matter of great Advantage to be the
Confe&s;&s;or of Ladies, and the more one can
get of them, the more Charitable Nur&s;es one
may be a&s;&s;ur'd of, who will never &s;uffer a
Man to want any thing, they can furni&s;h him
with. They from time to time &s;end Pre&s;ents
to their Confe&s;&s;ors, which do make them full
amends for all their Pains, they have taken in
hearing their Confe&s;&s;ions. Moreover the
Confe&s;&s;ions are very gainful to the Prie&s;ts, by
rea&s;on of the Pecuniary Penances they impo&s;e
upon them, for their Sins. There is always
<PB N="313" REF="169">
a Trunk or Box at the lower end of their
Churches, whereof they are the Turn-Keys,
and according as they know the Per&s;on to be
Stocked with Riches, they command him
for his Penance to go and put &s;uch a Sum
into the Trunk. We gather'd once five hun|dred
Crowns on one of the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Holy-days,
in a Pari&s;h at <HI>Venice,</HI> and the next day we
divided the Mony among&s;t Eight of us, who
had been the Confe&s;&s;ors. The Cu&s;tom a|mong&s;t
them is, when any Covetous Man
comes to Confe&s;&s;ion, to repre&s;ent to him his
Sin, in the blacke&s;t Colours they can Po&s;&s;ible;
and afterwards to give him good Words, to
Sweeten him, and incline him to Liberality;
if thereupon he Te&s;tifie great Sorrow for his
Sin, they never give him Ab&s;olution, till he
have given &s;ome Sound Marks of his Repen|tance,
by dropping a very plentiful Alms into
the Trunk: And if he &s;hew any hardne&s;s of
Heart, yet they Ab&s;olve him neverthele&s;s,
for fear of Di&s;ta&s;ting him altogether with
Confe&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e they are in hopes to find
him another time in a better Humour, and
better di&s;pos'd for Repentance. When
Thieves and Robbers, U&s;urers, and tho&s;e
that u&s;e fal&s;e Weights and Mea&s;ures, come
to Confe&s;&s;ion, they oblige them, as they
ought, to make Re&s;titution, as far as it lies in
their Power &s;o to do. They enjoyn tho&s;e
who are not able to make a Per&s;onal Re|&s;titution,
that is, to the Per&s;ons they have
<PB N="314" REF="170">
Defrauded, either becau&s;e they are Dead,
or becau&s;e they do not know where they
are; the&s;e I &s;ay they enjoyn to make Re|&s;titution
to the Church, that is, to put an
Equivalent Sum into the Trunk. As for Per|&s;onal
Re&s;titutions, they are commonly per|form'd
by the Hand of the Confe&s;&s;or, to the
End that the Penitent, who mu&s;t be Con|cealed,
may not come into any Danger, as
he would, &s;hould he do it him&s;elf, of falling
into the Hands of Ju&s;tice. And in this ca&s;e
there always comes a con&s;iderable part of the
Sum to the Churches &s;hare, which he that
was Robb'd can never recover.</P>
<P>A <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Knight was Robb'd of two
Thou&s;and Crowns in Coin, at the time of a
<HI>Jubilee,</HI> granted by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the XIth. He
who had committed the Robbery, went and
Confe&s;t him&s;elf to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and put all
the Mony into the Hands of the Father
Rector, who had heard his Confe&s;&s;ion, to
re&s;tore it to the Gentleman to whom it did
belong. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> put Five hundred
Crowns of it into their Trunk, and carried
the re&s;t to the Knight, but he refus'd to take
the One Thou&s;and Five hundred Crowns, and
would have the whole Sum re&s;tor'd to him.
The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> after &s;ome Endeavours to per|&s;uade
him to receive his Mony, declar'd to
him, that in ca&s;e he would not take it be|fore
twice Twenty Four hours came about,
they would ca&s;t the re&s;t into the Trunk al&s;o,
<PB N="315" REF="170">
and that he &s;hould not have one Peny of
it. And they were as good as their words.
But the Knight repenting him&s;elf &s;ome days
after, came and told them, that &s;ince it could
be no otherwi&s;e, he would content him&s;elf
with the One Thou&s;and Five hundred Crowns
of his Mony. But the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> flowted at
him, telling him, That he was come too late,
and there was no Remedy, becau&s;e the
Church was in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Mo|ny;
thus it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Gentleman
to recover any part of it. This word <HI>of the
Church,</HI> which they make u&s;e of, when they
&s;ay, the Mony is given to the Church, the
Church is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is only a
fine word to deceive the Simple: For the
Church in the Sen&s;e, they take it, is a thing
in the Air, and indeed they are the Prie&s;ts
and Monks only that po&s;&s;e&s;s the Mony, and
make u&s;e of it for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Some believe that Confe&s;&s;ion, as it is practi|&s;ed
in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> is a very pro|per
means to remedy many Di&s;orders, and to
prevent a great many Sins, which if that
were Abrogated, many would make more
bold with: For, &s;ay they, many are re&s;train'd
from committing a bad Action, from the
&s;hame they have to Confe&s;s it afterwards
The Papi&s;ts will tell you, that the Prote&s;t|tants
reject this Sacrament, becau&s;e they
love Libertini&s;m, and hate all manner of re|&s;traint,
and any thing that may &s;erve to hum|ble
<PB N="316" REF="171">
them. As for my part, who have tried
both States, without flattering the Party I
have cho&s;en, I do profe&s;s, That I have ob&s;erv'd
more of Hone&s;ty, of Con&s;cience, and of
Vertue, in the External part of a Civil Life,
among&s;t the Prote&s;tants, than ever I found
among&s;t the Papi&s;ts, with all their Confe&s;&s;ions.
As for that which is Internal, 'tis God alone
that can judge of it: And I hope, that the
Fear of God, and of his Judgments, does
bring forth far more Noble Effects in their
Hearts, than a Human Shamefac'dne&s;s doth
produce in tho&s;e who follow the Communion
of <HI>Rome.</HI> Be&s;ides, I conceive that Auricular
Confe&s;&s;ion may be rather prejudicial, than
any way advantagious to a Chri&s;tian Life,
which I prove thus: Bad Company and Vain
Conver&s;ation are prohibited, becau&s;e they
are commonly known to corrupt good Man|ners:
<Q>Corrumpunt bonos mores Colloquia prava.</Q>
Now we may truly &s;ay, That the Prie&s;ts and
the Monks of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are every
day, whil&s;t they are in their Confe&s;&s;ionals, in
very lewd Company, as where they hear
nothing but Bla&s;phemies, lewd Practices, Vil|lanies,
Trea&s;ons, Robberies, Murthers, Revenge;
In a word, what&s;oever is &s;uperlatively Wicked
and Infamous. They in &s;ome &s;ort familiarize
them&s;elves with &s;uch abominable Filthine&s;s, by
the continual hearing of them, and the re|iterated
<PB N="317" REF="171">
Examples thereof, which they have
almo&s;t continually before them, makes the
Confe&s;&s;ors accu&s;tom them&s;elves by degrees with
them, and to have le&s;s horrour for them, and
commit them with le&s;s reluctancy. The
Clergy being thus corrupted by the Seculars,
do as it were in Revenge influence a double
Corruption upon the Seculars, and by the
perpetual circulation of their &s;ecret Commu|nications,
or Confe&s;&s;ions, they mi&s;erably infect
and &s;poil one another. We may conclude
then, that the Confe&s;&s;ionals are rather wor&s;e
than Bad Company; and for the little good
which &s;ometimes by chance they may be the
cau&s;e of, they give occa&s;ion to far greater
Evils, which without there would never hap|pen.</P>
<P>Moreover, we mu&s;t add to this the dange|rous
and fal&s;e Doctrin, that is Taught and
Preached in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> with relation
to this Subject; which is this, <HI>That Attrition
being joyn'd with Confe&s;&s;ion, is &s;ufficient to Sal|vation,
to tho&s;e who after Bapti&s;m are fallen into
Mortal Sin.</HI> This Attrition, according to them,
is a Sorrow for having offended God, only
for fear of the Eternal Puni&s;hments of Hell,
which are due to Sinners, without which they
would never have had any Sorrow for having
offended him. They &s;uppo&s;e therefore, ac|cording
to this Doctrin, that a Man who is
altogether de&s;titute of Charity, or the Love
of God; and, what is more, who hath a
<PB N="318" REF="172">
formal Hatred again&s;t him, as he con&s;iders him
ab&s;tractedly in the effects of his Ju&s;tice, may
neverthele&s;s be &s;aved, when he fears God only
as an Avenging God; &s;o he do but &s;uper|add
to this &s;ervile Fear, the Sacrament of Con|fe&s;&s;ion.
This is that which gives a wonderful
pre&s;umption to Sinners, and encourageth them
to &s;pend the chief part of their Lives in the
ways of Iniquity: For there is no Man, be he
never &s;o profligately Wicked, who will not be
ready to promi&s;e for him&s;elf, when he is at the
Point of Death, he &s;hall doubtle&s;s be &s;eized
with the fear of falling into the hands of the
Living God, and yet have time enough to &s;end
for a Confe&s;&s;or, to whom he may declare his
Sins; Which done, he is as &s;ure of going to
Paradice, as the good Thief was on the
Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>This Doctrin was invented by the Prie&s;ts
of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to exalt the force
and virtue of Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion, which is
&s;o plea&s;ing and profitable to them, tho' with
the lo&s;s of &s;o many Souls, who peri&s;h by this
unhappy Per&s;ua&s;ion. Probably, after having
deceiv'd a great many others, they at la&s;t
deceive them&s;elves al&s;o; for many of the&s;e
Confe&s;&s;ors Dye like Dogs, and make de&s;perate
Ends, endeavouring to per&s;uade them&s;elves,
that their Confe&s;&s;ion, and their fear of falling
into Hell with &s;ave them. I never found, that
the Prie&s;ts and Monks were ever very ready
to go and confe&s;s them&s;elves: They love no|thing
<PB N="319" REF="172">
more, than to Confe&s;s others; and hate
nothing wor&s;e, than to Confe&s;s them&s;elves.
A Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> told me, <HI>That before the
Publi&s;hing of a certain Order by the Patriarch,
by which he enjoyn'd all Prie&s;ts to Confe&s;s them|&s;elves
at lea&s;t once a Month, upon Penalty of
Interdict from Ma&s;s, and Su&s;pen&s;ion from all
Sacred Functions, there was &s;carcely a Prie&s;t to
be &s;een at</HI> Venice <HI>that went to Confe&s;&s;ion. One
might &s;ee them often going directly from the Stews
to the Altar, and to Confe&s;s others; but as for
them&s;elves, they did not think it worth the
pains.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But at pre&s;ent they are obliged every Three
Months, to bring their Atte&s;tations to the Pa|triarch
in Writing, that they have Confe&s;t
them&s;elves according to Order. The &s;ame
Method is ob&s;erv'd at</HI> Milan, <HI>and in &s;everal
other parts of</HI> Italy. <HI>As for the Hearing of
Confe&s;&s;ions, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Fair
Sex, alas, the Ca&s;e is altered with them, and
they run to them very greedily! You'l &s;ee them
Walking in their Churches about their Con|fe&s;&s;ion-Chairs
from Morning to Night, to
watch for a Bird to be &s;nar'd in their Net.</HI>
How happy am I, <HI>(&s;aid once a Curate to me
of a great City in</HI> Italy) I have no Family to
put me to Charge, and I have much more Mony
than I know what to do with: I have often
most Ravi&s;hing Concerts of Mu&s;ick in my Church,
in which I take unutterable Plea&s;ure: When I
have nothing el&s;e to do, I walk under the &s;umptuous
<PB N="320" REF="173">
gilded Roofs of this Magnificent Temple, of which
I make (as it were) my own Hou&s;e: I never
want Company at my Confe&s;&s;ional, where I meet
with the &s;atisfaction of hearing a Thou&s;and diffe|rent
Stories and Adventures: God grant me the
Grace only, that after having enjoy'd my Paradice
in this World, I may afterwards go and po&s;&s;e&s;s it
in the other.</P>
<P>This is what I had to declare to you, con|cerning
the practice of Sacramental Con|fe&s;&s;ion
among&s;t the Papi&s;ts; I &s;hall only add,
that the Secrecy, which is as it were the Seal
of it, is not &s;o faithfully ob&s;erv'd as they
would fain have us believe it is: For many
things are di&s;cover'd by the&s;e Confe&s;&s;ors, and
tho&s;e poor Gally-Slaves, I but ju&s;t now men|tion'd,
and who 'tis likely to the very Hour
do Groan under that Dreadful Task, are a
&s;ad, but certain in&s;tance of it. A Confe&s;&s;or
that reveals a Confe&s;&s;ion, according to the
Law in that ca&s;e Provided, ought to be Burnt
alive: But tho' many Confe&s;&s;ions be every
day reveal'd, yet don't we find &s;o much as
one only Confe&s;&s;or, that has this Sentence
Executed upon him; fora&s;much as it is in a
manner impo&s;&s;ible to Convict them thereof.
A Prie&s;t is always believed upon his Oath,
and if he can but re&s;olve to Swear that he
hath not revealed the Confe&s;&s;ion, there is no
going any further; &s;o that at pre&s;ent Fire
and Fagot are only made u&s;e of again&s;t Sor|cerers
and Hereticks. I could here have re|lated
<PB N="321" REF="173">
to you many gallant Stories, as well as
&s;ome very Tragical ones, which have been
depo&s;ited with me in Confe&s;&s;ion, but I find
no inclination to do it; not becau&s;e I fear
the Papi&s;ts Fire, but becau&s;e I am of the
mind, that an hone&s;t Man, who hath charg'd
him&s;elf with a Secret, is oblig'd in Honour to
keep it, as far as po&s;&s;ibly he may. Indeed
this is the very Rea&s;on, why I have only en|tertain'd
you here with &s;ome common things,
which are known to all tho&s;e who will take
the pains to be a little inqui&s;itive, and which
I have ob&s;erv'd out of Confe&s;&s;ion, or which
have been told me by Per&s;ons of Credit, and
who have put me under no Engagement to
conceal them.</P>
<P>Some it may be will be de&s;irous to be in|form'd,
what kind of Penances the Confe&s;&s;ors
impo&s;e upon their Penitents in Confe&s;&s;ion.
According to the Doctrin of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' God
doth pardon Sins as to the Guilt, in Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
and tho' he remits to Penitents the
External Puni&s;hment due to their Sins; yet
neverthele&s;s his Will is, that they &s;uffer here
for the &s;ame Sins &s;ome petty temporal Puni&s;h|ment;
and this he has left to the Judgment
and Di&s;po&s;al of the Prie&s;ts of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> who may do in it what they plea&s;e
them&s;elves. Conformably to this they order
&s;ome to Fa&s;t on certain days, to others to &s;ay
a Set of Prayers, and to others to pay &s;o
much Mony, and to &s;ome other to receive
<PB N="322" REF="174">
Di&s;cipline or Penance. There have been
found &s;ome of the New Saints of the Popi&s;h
Church, who out of Humility (&s;o they ex|pre&s;s
them&s;elves,) have made their Confe&s;&s;ors
to give them Di&s;cipline; S. <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> S. <HI>There&s;a,</HI>
and Si&s;ter <HI>Margaret</HI> of the Holy Sacrament,
were of this Number. The Confe&s;&s;ors, to
give them their due, are not wanting to
give Credit to, and to extend the&s;e holy Pra|ctices
of Humility, upon which they be&s;tow
continual Elogies; yet in the mean time, we
&s;ee that the generality of People are not
much affected with the&s;e kind of Examples,
and there are but &s;ome few of the Confe&s;&s;ors
who&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions, as to this Point, prove
Effectual.</P>
<P>The Penitentiaries or Confe&s;&s;ors of the
Churches of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> of S. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Lateran,</HI>
of <HI>Lorette,</HI> of S. <HI>January</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> of S. <HI>Pe|tronius</HI>
of <HI>Boulogn,</HI> and of many other Places
of Devotion in <HI>Italy,</HI> have great white-Rods
in their Hands, as they &s;it in their Confe&s;&s;i|onals,
wherewith they &s;trike not only tho&s;e
that come to be Confe&s;&s;ed, but al&s;o all &s;orts
of Per&s;ons, be they Men or Women, that
pre&s;ent them&s;elves before them to receive
their Ble&s;&s;ing, giving them &s;mall Stroaks upon
their Head, their Shoulders, and their Ears;
which done, the Per&s;ons &s;o Struck, make a
very low Bow to them by way of Thanks for
that Favour. An <HI>Armenian</HI> once demanded
of me, <HI>What was the meaning of this Practice?</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="174">
I told him that it was a Practice of Humili|ty,
by which the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks expre&s;t
their readine&s;s to receive all the Cha&s;ti&s;ements,
which the Church thought good to inflict up|on
them; to which he An&s;wered, Smiling;
<HI>Do you believe</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>that if the&s;e Black
Men who Beat them,</HI> (he meant by that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion
the Je&s;uits, who are the Confe&s;&s;ors
of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> and who are dre&s;t in Black) <HI>&s;hould
make good Sound Stroaks upon them, that the
People would expre&s;s as much Earne&s;tne&s;s to be
favoured with them, as now they do?</HI> I was not
able to an&s;wer him as to that Point: But
this I know, that upon a time a Prote&s;tant
of <HI>Geneva</HI> received &s;uch Stroaks from them,
that in&s;tead of Complimenting them for the
Favour, he run away from them as fa&s;t as ever
he could. This Prote&s;tant, it &s;eems, who
was not Inur'd to the Ceremonies of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> had the Curio&s;ity to enter
the Church of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> at the time that Ma&s;s
was Saying, and was either &s;o Neglectful or
Ignorant, as not to fall down on his Knees
when they Sounded the Bell at the Elevation
of the Ho&s;t: Moreover, his Curio&s;ity led
him to draw near to a Statue of S. <HI>Peter,</HI>
which is on the Right &s;ide of the Church,
near to the High Altar: This Statue is of
Bra&s;s, and Repre&s;ents S. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;itting in a
Chair; He hath one of his Feet &s;tretched
outward, and the People out of Devotion, and
to &s;hew their Submi&s;&s;ion to the Holy See, come
<PB N="324" REF="175">
and ki&s;s his Toes, and put heir Heads under
his Foot. The Prote&s;tant &s;eeing them in the&s;e
Po&s;tures, could not forbear Laughing; but one
of the Je&s;uits, who had his Confe&s;&s;ional near
that place, and who had ob&s;erved him, came
to him with his great Wand, and &s;truck him
as hard as ever he could upon his Head and
Shoulders: The Prote&s;tant betook him&s;elf to
his Heels, without &s;o much as ever looking
behind him; the Je&s;uit all the while pur&s;uing
and beating him till he was got out of Church.
The great Noi&s;e this made, occa&s;ion'd much
Di&s;traction to tho&s;e that were Hearing Ma&s;s,
and every one &s;aid, it was a Heretick, whom
the Je&s;uit had had the Zeal to bang out of the
Church. There was no Body that expre&s;t the
lea&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion for him; and the Je&s;uit re|turned
glorying in the Act he had performed,
&s;aying, <HI>That tho' he had a good strong Arm, yet
he found that Hereticks Bones were &s;tronger and
harder.</HI></P>
<P>At another time I &s;aw a Prote&s;tant Abus'd
after the &s;ame manner in the Cathedral Church
of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> which could not
but be the more &s;en&s;ible to the&s;e Gentlemen,
becau&s;e it was but a little before, that they
had voluntarily &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the
Domination of <HI>France,</HI> and that they began
already to u&s;e them like Slaves, having &s;carcely
the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion allowed
them, in tho&s;e few Churches, the Papi&s;ts were
pleas'd to leave them.</P>

by their Example: This is one of my mo&s;t
