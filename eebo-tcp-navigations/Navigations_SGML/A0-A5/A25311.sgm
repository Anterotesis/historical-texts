<HEAD>THE AMOURS OF THE Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Fir&s;t Part.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_ACMAT</HI> (the Grand Signior) who &s;ucceed|ed <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. was the be&s;t-made Man in his whole Empire. He was tall, had a goodly Meen, full of Maje&s;ty and Grandeur; his Eyes were black, large, and roll'd with a &s;parkling Fire: The Air of his Face was noble and commanding.
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y">and whenever he &s;poke, it &s;oftned in|to a thou&s;and Sweetne&s;&s;es; His Soul was much more agreeable than his Per&s;on, though it was a receiv'd opi|nion, it was not to his Quality he owed the number of tho&s;e that called him the goodlie&s;t Man that had been formed. He was exactly made for a great Lover and a fine Gentleman; his Succe&s;s among&s;t the Ladies made it evident, and the care he took to make his Court to the fair Sex had been &s;eldom in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Indamora,</HI> by him created Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> had found how to fix his Heart; for though he had continued &s;ome years amorous of the fair <HI>Ho|mira,</HI> to whom he gave the Title of Sultana, yet had a thou&s;and Pa&s;&s;ions intervened, and &s;he was con&s;trained to &s;uffer Rivals; yet &s;he retained the Sovereignity, and the great <HI>Acmat</HI> held him&s;elf obliged to be con&s;tant to none but her; till Time, which perfects all things, let him &s;ee that <HI>Homira</HI> did not de&s;erve &s;o much from him, and that <HI>Amurath,</HI> a private
<PB N="3" REF="3">Gentleman, but beautiful as an Angel; po&s;&s;e&s;t the favourable Inclinations of that Sultana, while&s;t the Sultan had nothing but her Per&s;on, and that too but in part.</P>
<P>She was tall, and had an unexpre&s;|&s;ible Grandeur accompanied all &s;he did; her Eyes were beyond the power of being defined, her whole Features admirable, and one of the fine&s;t made Faces that had perhaps ever been &s;een. She de&s;erved the Epithet of a great Beauty, and exceeded what is pro|perly called &s;o.</P>
<P>'Tis a truth, &s;he had loved the Sul|tan before he was &s;o; but Ambition, which was her predominant Pa&s;&s;ion, (while&s;t &s;he yet &s;et &s;ome bounds to her Luxury) did not permit her to tell it him; but as &s;oon as De&s;tiny had determined the Fate of <HI>Mahomet</HI> III. and that <HI>Acmat</HI> was actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Ottoman Empire, &s;he made appear that the fir&s;t day he could call the Scepter his, &s;he became his al&s;o.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P><HI>Acmat</HI> very well &s;aw he owed the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;on of <HI>Homira</HI> (though not to her Inclinations) to his Crowns; and though he was ac|cu&s;tomed never to let tho&s;e niceties di&s;turb him, yet he could have wi&s;ht &s;he had not let the World &s;ee &s;he gave the Monarch what &s;he denied the Lo|ver, &s;ince it carried this di&s;advantage with it, an encouragement to all that adored her. It was very well &s;een her tran&s;porting de&s;ires to plea&s;e her &s;elf; &s;he was extream &s;en&s;ual, and &s;acrifi|ced all things to Plea&s;ure; her Am|bition was crowned, and all &s;he en|deavours is to per&s;uade the Grand Signior of her tenderne&s;s, and to gra|tifie her Inclinations.</P>
<P>But that Re&s;traint which &s;he for &s;ome years had put upon them, on purpo&s;e to &s;ecure the E&s;teem of the Sultan, &s;he began to grow weary of; and &s;he abandoned her &s;elf to almo&s;t all the va&s;t number that adored her.</P>
<P>The Sultan, who pa&s;&s;ionately lov'd her, pa&s;&s;ed over Faults too gro&s;s for any to continue in his favour that had
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">been guilty of them, and was, beyond her expectation, (infinitely beyond her de&s;erts) indulgent, would be|lieve nothing to her di&s;advantage, and if he at all minded her of her ill conduct, it was after a manner &s;o obliging as if he believed &s;he could do nothing that de&s;erved reproving.</P>
<P>It was much about this time when the young <HI>Amurath</HI> came to Court. He had received from the Sultan that extream Grace, to ki&s;s the Hand of the Sultana Queen; he came to her Appartments in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> in order to it. The Queen was not yet come into the Chamber of Pre&s;ence. <HI>Ho|mira</HI> attended her there; and when the young <HI>Amurath</HI> appeared, &s;he pre&s;ently had de&s;igns upon his Heart. As for what concerned him, he was wholly amazed to &s;ee a Woman &s;o perfectly beautiful as <HI>Homira:</HI> She was dre&s;s'd gloriou&s;ly, and in &s;o at|tractive a manner, that <HI>Amurath,</HI> ha|&s;tily advancing, fell before her on his Knees, and treated her as if he had believed her the Sultana Queen,
<PB N="6" REF="5">(by the Maje&s;ty of her Meen.) This &s;o very well &s;atisfied <HI>Homira</HI>'s humour, that &s;he was going to &s;ay &s;omething very obliging to him, when that the Sultana Queen entring prevented her: She withdrew from the pre&s;ence; and <HI>Amurath</HI> (when he came to Court, came with a de&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h an in|tere&s;t there,) followed her as &s;oon as he had ended his Court to the Sulta|na Queen.</P>
<P>This mi&s;take made a great noi&s;e, and was much for <HI>Amurath</HI>'s Advan|tage, <HI>Homira</HI> not much valuing a di&s;|creet Lover, but a pa&s;&s;ionate and a brave: 'tis true, he ran the ri&s;que of the Sultan's di&s;plea&s;ure, but he was of opinion he ought to do no le&s;s, before he could be called to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o beautiful a Prince&s;s as <HI>Homira.</HI> He believed Writing to her was what he ought to do, and in that Con&s;ideration he &s;ent her this Letter.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y">
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>IF the Mi&s;take I made was for my di&s;advantage, con&s;ider, if you plea&s;e, fair</HI> Homira, <HI>if you are not a Queen, 'tis an Inju&s;tice done to your Merit; ac|cu&s;e cruel Fortune, and not</HI> Amurath, <HI>who, were it in his power, would not de|lay making what he then believed you. Let me conjure you, fair Sultana, to permit me &s;peak with you this Evening at your own Appartments; for never was there one more adored you, (or more pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired you to live with me as if you were a&s;&s;ured of it) than</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Con&s;idering the Fame <HI>Homira</HI> had in the world, this Letter was not writ with too much precaution; but &s;he was of a great Quality (having mar|ried a very noble Turk) before &s;he had the Title of Sultana, which her being Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Grand Signior acquired her, had &s;he been le&s;s kind &s;he had certainly been ju&s;t to her Mo|narch; but her inclinations were fa|vourable,
<PB N="8" REF="6">and her Ruin inevitable. She received the Letter with an un|expre&s;&s;ible Joy, and with her accu|&s;tomed manner of Writing when &s;he de&s;igns to oblige, &s;he made this return.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>YOur mi&s;take was for me too glorious, and too advantagious to you to ex|pect any thing be&s;ides Acknowledgment; you were not formed ever to be di&s;appoint|ed in any thing you de&s;ire: The Sultan leaves me at</HI> 10 <HI>a Clock; I will then ex|pect you, to a&s;&s;ure you, nor your Conduct nor your Per&s;on has di&s;plea&s;ed</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Homira.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Amurath</HI> failed not to be at the A&s;&s;ignation at the pointed hour; he found the Sultana as meltingly kind as &s;he had been to a great many others, but <HI>Amurath</HI> is more happy than all; &s;he will abandon tho&s;e &s;he before treated favourably, and will give her &s;elf up entirely to her Sultan and her dear <HI>Amurath.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="6" MS="y">
<P>While&s;t <HI>Homira</HI> had thus di&s;po|&s;ed of her &s;elf, <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> Brother to the Sultan, (matchle&s;s for Valour and Conduct) returned from gaining a glorious Victory. His Succe&s;s was a|lone derived from his Governing; and never was a great Prince a bet|ter Soldier: He had early all the ex|perience of a brave General, and ne|ver could the great <HI>Acmat</HI> commit the Sa&s;ety and the Glory of his Em|pires to a better Manager. Succe&s;s con&s;tantly followed all his De&s;igns, and it was &s;aid of him <HI>He was the be&s;t of Soldiers and the be&s;t of Subjects;</HI> nor did his warlike humour render him unfit for other things, he was a great Courtier and a great States|man. <HI>Homira</HI> believed it her Intere&s;t to make him hers; &s;he employed all her Cunning to effect it, and though at fir&s;t &s;he only de&s;igned him her Friend, &s;he at length (maugre her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Amurath,</HI> and common Policy) re&s;olved him her Lover. It was impo&s;&s;ible for her to fail, when &s;he endeavoured any thing of that na|ture;
<PB N="10" REF="7">yet the Prince was ea&s;ily ore|come with an opinion of her Love to him, and her dazling Charms: He took her to his Arms, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to bury there the reflection of the Crime he committed in injuring a Brother &s;uch as <HI>Acmat</HI> (and in &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible manner.) In all probabi|lity <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> had ever loved her, had he not learned by &s;ome what a Repu|tation &s;he had. His Inclinations are virtuous, and he could not endure to &s;ee him&s;elf fond of a Woman that de|&s;erved rather Contempt. He lo&s;t his &s;teem for her, and was &s;eeking for &s;ome Pretext to break with her with|out her &s;eeing he de&s;ired it: He be|lieved it was be&s;t the Quarrel &s;hould begin on her part, but while&s;t he is at a lo&s;s how to give her an occa&s;ion of it, as if unde&s;ignedly, there was an accident fell out that ever after made her his Enemy.</P>
<P>He was once in her Cabinet, and care&s;&s;ing her with all the &s;weetne&s;s imaginable, and on the point of re|ceiving &s;ome te&s;timonies of her Pa&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="11" REF="7" MS="y">when the Sultan entred. <HI>Mu|&s;tapha</HI> was &s;urprized, and in a confu|&s;ed manner retired. <HI>Aomat</HI> was ex|treamly di&s;ordered: He did not ex|pect to find a Rival in the Prince his Brother; he &s;aid little to the Sulta|na, but retired ill-humoured and irre|&s;olved.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> &s;aw his Ruin inevitable, but endeavours mu&s;t be u&s;ed to pre|vent it, if po&s;&s;ible: Either the Prince or the Sultana mu&s;t be di&s;graced. It was ea&s;y to be re&s;olved who ought to &s;uffer. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> hated an ill Action, and yet unwilling as he was to &s;acri|fice <HI>Homira,</HI> he acknowledged her un|worthy a place in the Sultan's e&s;teem, (how then one &s;o large as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;t in his heart?) He calls to his aid <HI>Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, Grand Vi&s;ier, who had rai&s;ed <HI>Homira</HI> to what &s;he was; the Title of Sultana was given at his De&s;ire; &s;he had promi&s;ed him her Favours if he could procure it for her. He was pa&s;&s;ionately in Love, and did what &s;he commanded; &s;he is the
<PB N="12" REF="8">Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> but very treacherous; &s;he denies to reward his Love and his Care, contemns him, and in a word u&s;es him &s;o, that from her pa&s;&s;ionate Lover he became her mo&s;t mortal E|nemy. <HI>Amurath</HI> had been brought to Court by him, with a de&s;ign to ruin this ungrateful: He had placed Spies on all her Actions, and was extream|ly plea&s;ed, he could &s;ave <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> from ruin by expo&s;ing her. He bids the Prince endeavour his own &s;afety; that if he were &s;o fatally generous as to offer his own Life for ran&s;oming a faithle&s;s Womans, after &s;uch a Sa|crifice &s;he would but triumph over his Weakne&s;s. In &s;hort, he di&s;po&s;es the Prince to a Pre&s;ervation of him|&s;elf. He was once informed by the Grand vi&s;ier, that <HI>Amurath</HI> was then with <HI>Homira, Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a tells him, that he ought not to neglect &s;o favourable an opportunity of reconciling him&s;elf to the Sul|tan: <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> goes then to the great <HI>Acmat,</HI> lets him &s;ee how ill he did to di&s;grace him for an in|famous
<PB N="13" REF="8">Woman, and pur&s;uing that Point, brought the Grand Signior to li&s;ten to him at length, and fol|lowing that Advantage, with ano|ther, made him pa&s;s to the Sulta|na's Lodgings, where <HI>Amurath</HI> was found with <HI>Homira,</HI> in a place the Sultan allowed none be&s;ides him|&s;elf to be in.</P>
<P>She being thus di&s;covered, ca&s;t her &s;elf at the feet of her injured Mo|narch, but he was too &s;en&s;ibly touched at her perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, to be moved at any thing &s;he could &s;ay or do: He left her drowned in de&s;pair, in anger and Grief, he carried <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> with him from her Apartments, and began there to acquie&s;ce with the Prince, and blame him&s;elf for loving an infamous Woman, and one that abandoned her &s;elf to all &s;orts of Criminal and Scan|dalous Pa&s;&s;ions; his Re&s;entments ter|minated in having no more e&s;teem for <HI>Homira,</HI> and in di&s;gracing <HI>Amu|rath.</HI></P>
<PB N="14" REF="9" MS="y">
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier was revenged on the Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> the Sultan has left loving her, and, to all appearance, has intirely abandoned her, but he was not a&s;&s;ured he &s;hould do &s;o for ever; <HI>Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a was acquainted perfect|ly with his Humour, he forgets Inju|ries the &s;oone&s;t of any Man alive, and might, perhaps, in favour of <HI>Homira,</HI> lo&s;e the Remembrance of her Infamy. But <HI>Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a will prevent that by all the ways can be thought on, there is a very fair Chri&s;tian Slave ta|ken, he ran&s;oms her, and places her with the Sultana Queen, in a Station &s;o advantageous for his De&s;igns, that as often as the Sultan came out of that &s;ide, he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ee her; &s;he was of a good Stature, finely &s;haped, prettily turn'd and Gentile, her Face little, but all over Charms, fine &s;weet Eyes, a pretty Mouth, good Teeth, and an Air &s;o peculiar to her&s;elf, that tho' Detraction had very little to &s;ay of the re&s;t, yet that engaged beyond all things, &s;o innocently &s;weet, &s;o guiltle&s;s of Cunning and de&s;ign, and
<PB N="15" REF="9">yet none has more than &s;he, that the Sultan would often &s;ay, &s;he was a Miracle in nature; he lo&s;es his Li|berty as &s;oon as he &s;ees her; he em|ploys <HI>Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a to tell her of the Conque&s;t, and that &s;he might be a&s;|&s;ured the Ottoman Emperor was rea|dy to lay his Crowns at her Feet, (as great a Monarch as he was,) if &s;he commanded it.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier was full of Joy at the Succe&s;s that attended his De&s;igns; he will know the Hi&s;tory, and the Qua|lity, the Merit, as well as the Beauty, of his Captive, before he puts his In|tere&s;t with hers; not but the Sultan's Approbation and Pa&s;&s;ion for her was enough to &s;ecure him; but he will know if he finds her ready to follow all he &s;hall advi&s;e, if &s;he will, then he is the ab&s;olute Monarch of the Sultan, &s;ince it was the Humour of that Mo|narch to let him&s;elf be govern'd by the Woman he loves, the Grand Vi|&s;ier believes it nece&s;&s;ary for his De|&s;igns, that he &s;hould be acquainted
<PB N="16" REF="10">with the Life of <HI>Indamora,</HI> (for &s;o was the fair Chri&s;tian call'd,) &s;he had confu&s;edly related to him &s;ome of the particulars when he fir&s;t ran&s;omed her, but that does not &s;atisfie, he goes to her then, conjures her to give him that Satisfaction, &s;ince he a&s;&s;ured her it was for both their Intere&s;ts, he &s;hould be ignorant of nothing that concerned her; after &s;ome Excu&s;es and Denials, &s;he a&s;&s;ents, and gives him this following Relation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="17" REF="10" MS="y">
<HEAD><HI>The Hi&s;tory of</HI> Indamora.</HEAD>
<P>YOu per&s;uade me, my Lord, by &s;o powerful a way, that I mu&s;t re&s;olve to make you acquainted with all my Weakne&s;&s;es: To begin then, I am the Daughter of a <HI>German,</HI> my Father was more obliged to the Gifts of Nature, than tho&s;e of Fortune; however, he was a good Gentleman, and lived e&s;teemed by all, his Humour retired, and we, in complai&s;ance to it, &s;hared his Solitude with him: I will not tell you I was naturally plea&s;|ed with it, but &s;ince I &s;aw no way to get my &s;elf out of it, I acquie&s;ced.</P>
<P>I had not long lived in an Age ca|pable of di&s;tingui&s;hing things of &s;uch a nature, when I became in Love with <HI>Alcander,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious of the Kingdom, and Son to the Em|peror's Si&s;ter, who had married her &s;elf to one of her Brothers Subjects; her unfortunate Marriage was never
<PB N="18" REF="11">forgiven her, but oppre&s;s'd with the fatal Anger of his Imperial Maje&s;ty: She died full of Royal Grief and Sor|row, in Travail with <HI>Alcander;</HI> him &s;he had e&s;pou&s;ed loved her too ten|derly to &s;urvive her long, but, after having mourned her lo&s;s, he followed her in a very little time. <HI>Alcander</HI> be|ing thus left to the Mercy of an in|cen&s;ed King, was, in all appearance, to run a mo&s;t deplorable Fortune; but the Emperor's Anger being dead with his Si&s;ter, the Prince&s;s, ordered a great Care &s;hould be taken of the Royal Orphan, and gave command to have him brought up and educated as his own Son, loaded him with Titles, and, as &s;oon as he was capable of them, he gave him great Employs. I am going to tell you how it was I fir&s;t &s;aw him, which was almo&s;t admirable in a Life &s;o retired, &s;o free from Court as mine: He was a fine Man, well &s;haped, of a good height, when I fir&s;t knew him, which was when he was very young, his Soul was extreme Amorous, had a great &s;hare of Incon&s;tancy; but where
<PB N="19" REF="11">he loved, it was with the greate&s;t fer|vency imaginable; the Emperor was Hunting one day in a Wood joyning our Hou&s;e, which was &s;eated very com|modious for that &s;ort of Diver&s;ion, <HI>Alcander</HI> was then with him, and ha|ving &s;een me at a great Window I had thrown open for the better &s;eeing the Court pa&s;s; he &s;eem'd not di&s;plea&s;ed with me, but alighting from his Hor&s;e ha&s;tily, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be con|ducted by my Servants to the place where I was; 'tis not ea&s;ie to define the Surprize this Action gave me; however, I was infinitely charmed with his good Meen, his Wit, and his Addre&s;s; he found my Inclinations did not agree with that &s;ort of Life, he talk'd tenderly, I was in an Age wherein I believed all that fell from his inchanting Tongue was true; I be|gan to feel a Pa&s;&s;ion for him, and, af|ter he had a thou&s;and times &s;ighed for my &s;ake in one hour, I was &s;en&s;ible of a plea&s;ing Fire he had in&s;pired me with; I gave way for him to endea|vour the bringing me to Court, which
<PB N="20" REF="12">he conjured me to agree to; and, when he retired, after a many Prote&s;tations of Admiration, <HI>he bad me be a&s;&s;ured, I had in him not only a great Friend, but a great Lover:</HI> This Confe&s;&s;ion drew &s;ome Blu&s;hes from me. But the fol|lowing day he came again to vi&s;it me, then it was I lo&s;t my Liberty, for in that fatal hour I made no difficulty to own I loved him; I valued not to be di&s;creet, there is no &s;uch thing in Love, but I made it all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life to be ever telling him my Pa&s;&s;ion. I &s;aw all his Actions with Plea&s;ure, there was an agreeable Inchantment in them, I repined not at the freedom I had lo&s;t, nor to have been as great as Heaven is high, would have been unacquainted with him again. It was thus agreeably I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of my Life; nor envied I Monarchs in my re|tirement, when e're <HI>Alcander</HI> &s;hared it with me; but as the place I lived in was &s;o di&s;tant from the Court, that <HI>Alcander</HI>'s Attendance on the Empe|ror prevented him from &s;eeing me as often as he de&s;ired, he placed me with
<PB N="21" REF="12" MS="y">the Archdutche&s;s his Imperial Maje|&s;ties Daughter; I was with her in a very glorious Station, and though in a place where all &s;orts of Diver&s;ion were in u&s;e, I e&s;teemed it but as it gave me the greater Liberty to &s;ee <HI>Al|cander;</HI> and, to often a&s;&s;ure him of my Pa&s;&s;ion, I writ it to him, I told it to him in a Language tender and mo|ving; I ea&s;ily believed all this would &s;atisfie him, but when he had &s;een to what a height my Pa&s;&s;ion &s;oared, and that he was dearer a thou&s;and times to me than I had ever been to him, he triumph'd over my Weak|ne&s;s, and, lo&s;ing all manner of Re|&s;pect, by the opinion he had I could deny him nothing, he courted me for my undoing; I received the fir&s;t cruel Propo&s;als of my ruin with a terrible Emotion, and with &s;uch Di&s;dain, that <HI>Alcander</HI> dur&s;t not urge me further; but the following day &s;ent me this Letter.</P>

<P><HI>YOU are certainly the fal&s;e&s;t of all Wo|men; How is it you tell me you Love me, and yet u&s;e me as if I was the remote&s;t Man in all your Kindne&s;s?

<P>I &s;wooned at the reading of this Letter, and was ju&s;t recovered as <HI>Al|cander</HI> entered; he flew to me, and, receiving me in his Arms, he whi&s;per|ed &s;o many fatal, poy&s;oning, charming Things, that I had no longer the power to be angry with him; he pro|te&s;ted he could not &s;ee me, and not de&s;ire to be the happie&s;t Man Breath|ing,

<P><HI>The Archdutche&s;s has commanded me to attend her to morrow at the &s;ame time I appointed you; there is no Denials to be made her, it is not after that manner &s;he mu&s;t be treated. Adieu, and believe I Love you above every thing, but the de|&s;ire I have to make you happy.</HI></P>

<P>I was con&s;trained to u&s;e Di&s;&s;imula|tion; I was really meritorious of pity; I loved <HI>Alcander,</HI> and could not live without telling it him; I believed I could ever pretend Bu&s;ine&s;s, and by that continue my &s;elf dear to him, &s;ince it &s;hould appear wholly out of my Power to gratifie him: Had I been le&s;s in Love, I &s;hould have taken Re|&s;olutions very different from the&s;e; I would have learn'd him a de&s;ign I had then entertained, of never &s;eeing him again, if I could not do it without pre|judicing my Honor and Virtue; but I, all Pa&s;&s;ion, could not bear a Separati|on &s;o cruel, but lull'd him on with fal&s;e hopes, and promi&s;ed him all, without a de&s;ign to perform any thing.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI> believed nothing of my Ex|cu&s;e, and thought I had only broke my Promi&s;e, becau&s;e I had no mind to keep it; he would, however, come to the Lodgings of the Archdutche&s;s, where he was &s;atisfied I was gone; we met in the great Antichamber, <HI>How do you u&s;e me!</HI> &s;aid he &s;oftly to me; <HI>you Love me little, or Duty had not thus
<PB N="26" REF="15" MS="y">prevailed; you &s;ee me here by the Orders of my Prince&s;s.</HI> Replied I unconcernedly, <HI>But are you not &s;atisfied I attend her when &s;he commands it; you take little Care,</HI> per&s;ued I, <HI>of any but your &s;elf; Do not you &s;ee, if I had di&s;obeyed, the rea&s;on I &s;hould have had for it would have been inquired into; and in a Court, like this, a great deal of Pre|caution &s;ometimes avails but little; tho&s;e in my Circum&s;tances cannot be careful enough. Ah!</HI> interrupted <HI>Alcander,</HI> with a profound Sigh, <HI>You talk as if you did not Love me; I very well &s;ee with how much Faithle&s;ne&s;s you have u&s;ed me; it is not my Fault, if I am re|venged, nor can you be angry at it.</HI> He retired here, with a gloomy Melan|choly; and I, quitting the Apart|ments of the Archdutche&s;s, came to my own, &s;unk in Grief and in de&s;pair; I put my &s;elf to Bed, had it given out I was ill, and accordingly I was vi&s;ited on the morrow; among&s;t tho&s;e that came to &s;ee me, the Chief of the Religious made one, by that place he had the Title of a Prince; he was
<PB N="27" REF="15">not at all made for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Af|fairs, but it being one of the greate&s;t Place in the Kingdom, the Emperor be&s;towed it on <HI>Tiridate Agu&s;tus,</HI> ex|tremely in his Favour; this Prince ha|ving Authority from the Place, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to do almo&s;t any thing, &s;taid till the re&s;t of the Company was all retired, and throwing him&s;elf on his Knees by my Bed, he proceeded thus, <HI>You ought not to wonder, fair</HI> Indamora, <HI>at the Confe&s;&s;ion of my Pa&s;&s;ion; I am on the point of making you; I have very long loved you, but I very well knew, the un|grateful</HI> Alcander <HI>had alone all your Ten|derne&s;s, and, in a word, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Heart. Yes, Madam, I am now encouraged, &s;ince he no longer merits any thing, but &s;corn and contempt from you: He has, like a Villain, given me all your Letters, with a Command to tell you, he is no longer yours; and that all the Fa|vour ever he de&s;ires of you, is to burn tho&s;e you have of his, that the World might not be a Witne&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion, for an un|grateful and a faithle&s;s Woman. But,</HI> continued the Prince, &s;eeing me all in
<PB N="28" REF="16">Tears, <HI>'tis he alone is the ingrateful and perfidious; I e&s;teem you too much, to let you per&s;evere in an Engagement with one &s;o unde&s;erving and barbarous; and,</HI> con|tinuing with a great Sigh, and an extraordinary emotion of Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>had it been to</HI> Agu&s;tus <HI>the Divine</HI> Indamora <HI>had given tho&s;e Favours, there &s;hould no|thing have exacted a Confe&s;&s;ion from him, I know better what is due to my God and my Fair,</HI> &amp;c. He accompanied the&s;e la&s;t words with &s;o many Marks of a great Pa&s;&s;ion, that I, enraged with <HI>Alcander,</HI> and plea&s;ed with the Per&s;on and the Tenderne&s;s of the Prince, &s;uffered him to continue; he believed my &s;i|lence was advance enough, and took &s;o much Incouragement from it, as to ask for him&s;elf what I had denied <HI>Al|cander;</HI> I was &s;o enraged at that Faith|le&s;s Man, that I believed I could re|venge my &s;elf no way &s;o perfectly, as by favouring <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> beyond him; it was this con&s;ideration made me give the Prince whatever he could de&s;ire; 'tis very true, I had in my Arms a Man infinitely agreeable, &s;o made to charm
<PB N="29" REF="16">a Woman's Heart, that none, but I, could have denied him mine, but the hour was not yet come that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s that. I &s;till loved <HI>Alcander,</HI> and mu&s;t look on him as the cau&s;e of all my Ruin; it was, to be revenged on him, that I abandoned my Honor, and &s;uffered my &s;elf to be undone by a Man I then only e&s;teem'd; 'tis true, had I never &s;een <HI>Alcander,</HI> I &s;hould have loved <HI>Agu&s;tus,</HI> but the Prince had no|thing of my Tenderne&s;s, though he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and, in a word, enjoy'd me.</P>
<P>It was thus we lived for &s;ome time, I continued my feigned Indi&s;po&s;ition, and the Prince augmented his Pa&s;&s;ion, and his Care, for me; he very well &s;aw he had not yet my Love, he u&s;ed all his Addre&s;s to gain it; I made all he did agreeable to me, and began to &s;ee, I &s;hould be ungrateful, if I conti|nued to deny him my Heart; what I had done in an opinion it would en|rage <HI>Alcander,</HI> I, too late, found proved quite contrary; and if I will believe a Letter with his Name, which
<PB N="30" REF="17">I received, you &s;hall &s;ee by it he was plea&s;ed with my favouring the Prince.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>Could you imagin, incon&s;tant, faith|le&s;s,</HI> Indamora, <HI>that I ever took your De|nials for a Virtue? No, the event has let me &s;ee, nothing is impo&s;&s;ible; the Prince, after I had acquainted him with my ju&s;t Quarrel again&s;t you, confe&s;s'd him&s;elf in Love; I have a great deal of Friend&s;hip, and very ea&s;ily promi&s;ed him my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I gave him all your Letters, bid him employ them to his be&s;t Advantage, and, in &s;hort, endeavour to be more happy than I could be. You know the re&s;t, Madam, I have only to a&s;&s;ure you, I am extremly &s;atisfied at the good Fortune of my Friend, and conjure you to believe, that I am &s;o.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>I gave this Letter to the Prince to read, and, extremly enraged at the di&s;covering to his Friend my favouring of him, commanded him to retire, and &s;ee me no more, till I could be reconciled to him; I removed from the Court, for &s;ome &s;hort time, under pretext of change of Air; I took up a Re&s;olution of never believing, what a Man could &s;ay again, but re&s;olved,
<PB N="31" REF="17">with my &s;elf, to u&s;e them all as ill as they had done me, and return'd full of the de&s;igns; but I cannot tell, how I altered; the Prince had often writ to a&s;&s;ure me of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and im|plore my Pardon; I was really di&s;|plea&s;ed with him, but the extreme Graces of his Soul, and his Per&s;on, inclined me to &s;ome pity for him, and, at length, to a &s;en&s;e of Tenderne&s;s; I pardoned him, and tran&s;ported him with it, he certainly loved me, for ne|ver was one more fuller of Joy, to be reconciled to me, and I &s;tedfa&s;tly be|lieved, had not the Law forbid him to the contrary, I &s;hould have become his Wife. Mean time I &s;aw <HI>Alcander</HI> in publick Places, and it grew very difficult for me judge, which I loved be&s;t, the Prince or him; I found I could live without his Conver&s;ation, which before I could never have be|lieved; his &s;ullen Humor was one of his greate&s;t Graces, and gloomy and Melancholy as he was, when I appear|ed, &s;erved as no di&s;advantage to him.</P>
<P><HI>Tiridate Agu&s;tus</HI> was, by the Empe|ror,
<PB N="32" REF="18">commanded from Court about &s;ome private Bu&s;ine&s;s, that employ'd him two months; he deplored his Ab|&s;ence from me very often in his Let|ters, which were always writ in a Style &s;o tender and moving, that I was almo&s;t as much charmed with them, as with his Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI> could yet &s;ee by my Acti|ons, which I did not at all manage, that the Love I had for him was only abated, not extinct, he began to find, how much he was to blame in being &s;o ca|pricious, he would endeavour to again obtain my Pardon, he believed it no longer &s;o difficult to po&s;&s;e&s;s, what I had before denied him, the Prince had conquered me, and <HI>Alcander</HI> did not doubt Succe&s;s; he knows the greate&s;t Art con&s;i&s;ted in a Reconciliation, he con&s;iders my Pa&s;&s;ion for him, as a pow|erful &s;tep, he will make u&s;e of it, and follows me one Evening into a clo&s;e green Arbor in the Gardens, joyning the Archdutche&s;s's Apartment; as &s;oon as he was entered, he threw him|&s;elf at my Feet, and, hiding his Face
<PB N="31" REF="18">out of Shame and Re&s;pect, he pro|te&s;ted he &s;hould never dare to look on me again, till I gave him &s;ome a&s;&s;u|rance by my Pardon; I &s;aw at my Feet a Man, I loved, melting into Tender|ne&s;s and Sorrow, for having offended me; had I followed the Laws of Pa&s;|&s;ion, I had forgiven him, but when I had more cruel Reflections, and that I thought I was obliged to con&s;ider him as no other but as one that had inhumanly betray'd me, and been ac|ce&s;&s;ary to my ruin, I ro&s;e up, with &s;ome Emotions of Anger, in a Re&s;o|lution of quitting the Arbor; but oh, Heavens! how weak are tho&s;e in Love, I &s;unk into his Arms, and could not have &s;trength enough to retire, I gave him my Pardon e're he could again ask it of me; he &s;eem'd tran&s;ported at the Favour, he denied that cruel. Letter I received from him, and, as a Te&s;ti|mony to the contrary, a&s;&s;ured me, he had ever loved me; he maliciou&s;ly told me, it could proceed from none but the Prince, who had certainly the de&s;ign in it, to prevent my Reconci|liation
<PB N="34" REF="19">with <HI>Alcander</HI> again; this was to me &s;o probable, that it incen&s;ed me again&s;t <HI>Agu&s;tus,</HI> I accu&s;ed him of the Crime, and, in one of my Letters, commanded him not to endeavour the ju&s;tifying him&s;elf, that I was well a&s;|&s;ured all he could do would be impo&s;|&s;ible; and, in &s;hort, bid him to &s;ee me no more; he obey'd my Orders, too fatally in this Letter, but he has acquitted him&s;elf of that unju&s;t Su&s;|picion, too cruelly; he loved me more than Life, or Glory; what I had writ had reduced him to de&s;pair; he was acquainted with the Reconciliation of <HI>Alcander</HI> with me, and, not doubting whence my Anger proceeded, was re&s;olved, maugre the &s;trictne&s;s of the Laws then in force, to fight this trea|cherous; in &s;hort, he return'd privately to Court, and challenged <HI>Alcander,</HI> and kill'd him fairly in a Duel; this Action made a great noi&s;e, the Prince meritted death by the Laws, and, had not the Emperor been indulgent, he had certainly &s;uffered it, but he is par|doned by a Reprieve, and the Sentence
<PB N="35" REF="19">of death repealed for an eternal Ba|ni&s;hment: <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> was permitted to &s;ee the Emperor before he went, to render him his Acknowledgment for &s;paring his Life, when he had &s;o much de&s;erved death: He had no mind to &s;ee me, on the contrary, he &s;hunn'd coming to the Archdutche&s;s's, to take his leave before he went into Bani&s;h|ment, which he did as &s;oon as the ap|pointed time was come for his leaving <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>So fanta&s;tical was my de&s;tiny, I be|came pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with this Prince, after I had lo&s;t all hopes of ever &s;eeing him again; though <HI>Alcan|der</HI> had reconciled him&s;elf again to me, and that he died in a time he was extremely favoured, yet the Bravery and the great Pa&s;&s;ion of his Murderer, had made me not grieve at his death, &s;ince he fell by &s;o gallant a hand, and though it was for my &s;ake, I con&s;ider'd he was Criminal, and that the Prince was innocent; the Letter was <HI>Alcan|der</HI>'s, he is ba&s;e, he charges <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> with it; <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI>'s Re&s;entments of the
<PB N="36" REF="20">Perjury has charmed me, I infinitely e&s;teem'd him before, but now he has a greater &s;hare in my Heart than ever <HI>Alcander</HI> retained, he merits it more, and though I know it is an impo&s;&s;ible thing for me ever to hope the &s;eeing of him again, to a&s;&s;ure him of it; I cannot deny the Sentiments of my Heart from doing Ju&s;tice to his great Merit.</P>
<P>This fatal Accident rendered <HI>Ger|many,</HI> and more particularly the Court, di&s;agreeable to me, &s;ince it was &s;o to my Fortune: And whil'&s;t I am thus drown'd in a melancholy &s;orrow, and having lo&s;t all hope, of ever &s;eeing the Prince more, I am hurried, with all the Sentiments of Joy, to a probabi|lity great as my Love, of being, in &s;ome time, with him; he had retired him&s;elf to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the great Dutche&s;s Dowager of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> who was nearly related to the Emperor, and had made &s;ome continuance in his Court, was upon the point of returning, &s;he had taken a fancy to me, and begg'd of the Archdutche&s;s, that &s;he would allow
<PB N="37" REF="20">me to pa&s;s, into the Quality of one of of the Maids of Honour, that attended her, and to return with her to <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> I was unexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ed at this Turn, and I did not at all doubt, but that my better Fortune would, in &s;ome &s;hort time, conduct me to the Prince <HI>Tiridate Agu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>It was with a magnificent Splendor, that we left <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Emperor, the Empre&s;s, the Princes, and the Prin|ce&s;&s;es, together with the whole Court, accompanied the great Dutche&s;s Dowager three Leagues from the City, and did not then leave her with|out all the regret imaginable, and as &s;o fine a Prince&s;s, as &s;he was, did de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>The Archdutche&s;s recommended me tenderly to the Care of the great Dutche&s;s, and was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s an agreeable &s;orrow for parting with me.</P>
<P>We accompli&s;h'd our Journy to <HI>Po|land</HI> very happily, where the great Dutche&s;s was re&s;olved to make &s;ome &s;hort &s;tay, being obliged to it by the
<PB N="38" REF="21">Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> nothing could be more Glorious than the Reception we had there; the King is a gallant Prince, and had ordered every thing &s;o &s;plen|didly, that the great Dutche&s;s Dow|ager was extremely &s;atisfied with his manner of treating her; nothing was &s;een here but the mo&s;t Gallant Diver|&s;ions, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the King, the Queen, and the whole Court, was, how to render every thing agreeable.</P>
<P>But in the mid'&s;t of all the&s;e Diver|&s;ions, I found they were none to me, what the Prince <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> had done ju&s;t before, had rendered me aver&s;e to every thing of &s;uch a nature; his Re|&s;entments of my Proceedings mortally afflicted me, and altogether rendered my Thoughts nothing but perpetual Inquietudes, &s;o that, in &s;hort, not able to &s;upport &s;uch a world of Grief, I fell into a violent Fever, which, how|ever, was not la&s;ting, yet the whole Court de&s;paired, at fir&s;t, of my Life, and I &s;aw the great Dutche&s;s Dowager of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> enter into my Chamber all in Tears; <HI>I mu&s;t leave you,</HI> Indamora,

<P>She departed that moment, and I from that moment began to recover, I u&s;ed now, which I neglected before, my own Endeavours to get well again, the thoughts, that I &s;hould &s;uddenly &s;ee the Prince <HI>Tiridate,</HI> was a powerful Inducement, and when I con&s;idered, that the &s;ooner my Health returned, the &s;ooner I &s;hould &s;ee him again, I did every thing that could be done effectual; and, in &s;hort, I &s;aw my &s;elf, in ten days, perfectly recover'd, and free from all manner of pain, but that of Love; and nothing retarded my Journy, but a langui&s;hing weak|ne&s;s, which would not permit me yet to indure &s;o great a Fatigue.</P>
<P>But as every thing is cured by time, &s;o, within a few days, I &s;aw my &s;elf in a condition to travel, I began then my Journy to <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> but what avails it to have &s;urmounted one misfortune, &s;ince it was but to fall into a greater;

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s my Grief, to &s;ee my &s;elf a Pri&s;oner, to a Nation I then believed the mo&s;t barbarous in the world, their Cu&s;toms were &s;o different from ours, that I fancied I could never pa&s;s one hour of my Slavery agreeably; and to add to that Angui&s;h, the thoughts of lo&s;ing the

<P>They pre&s;ently re&s;olved us for the <HI>Seraglio</HI> of the Grand Signior, in a&s;&s;urance of a great Ran&s;om for us, and of me in particular, whom they treated very unlike an ordinary Captive, for the chief of the Turks, who had the Title of a Ba&s;&s;a, became pa&s;&s;ionately in love with me; and, as there was a Guard for his Per&s;on, he became &s;o carele&s;s of it, as to charge them with my Safety, and abandoned his own Pre&s;ervation for the Care of mine; he &s;ighed a thou&s;and times to me, I could under&s;tand no other Lan|guage, which mortally afflicted him, he took Care though to remedy that, and had me, with much difficulty, in&s;tructed in the Arabick; very per|fectly.</P>

<P><HI>Acmat,</HI> who was the mo&s;t amorous of all Princes, and who had Gran|deur enough to maintain tho&s;e Incli|nations, now indulged him&s;elf. <HI>Inda|mora</HI> had for him a thou&s;and Charms; and contrary to that wretched cu&s;tom which makes the Grand Signior's Pa&s;|&s;ion the &s;ole Reward of her he &s;avou|red, and that they were confined to a Seraglio, without the Liberty to &s;ee any but the Sultan and the Eunuchs

None of his Predece&s;&s;ors had ever indulged the fair Sex &s;o much as he.

<P>Never was an Ottoman Emperor before of &s;uch Inclinations; he had a great Soul charmed with Plea&s;ures, and ever went in &s;earch of them; he believed the greate&s;t terminated in the Arms of the fair Sex. <HI>It was,</HI> he would &s;ay, <HI>a great Inju&s;tice that the mo&s;t perfect Ble&s;&s;ings of human Life &s;hould be denied a Liberty which &s;erved but to make the contrary Sex more hap|py.</HI> The&s;e Sentiments were prejudi|cial to our Monarch; for all he had loved were debauched by them to be fal&s;e to him, but they &s;erved as great advantages towards the Conquering the Hearts of tho&s;e that loved to plea&s;e them&s;elves in Variety, and ha|ted Re&s;traint.</P>

<P>The Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who was extream pretty, ea&s;ily became &s;o much Glory; &s;he was to act a part whereto the greate&s;t Cunning in the World was required, and which with good management would be the mo&s;t ad|vantagious to her.

<P>The good Conduct, and the Cun|ning of <HI>Indamora,</HI> her Air of Innocence, her extreme Prettine&s;s, her affable Humour, her diverting Wit, and, in a word, a thou&s;and other Charms, fix'd the Sultan's Affections even to a miracle; he would &s;pend whole days with her, call'd her his Friend, and, in &s;hort, let him&s;elf be ab&s;olutely governed by her, the whole Ottoman Empire was as &s;he plea&s;ed to have it, all the great Offices are di&s;po&s;ed as &s;he de&s;ires; <HI>Germany</HI> is much advantaged by the a&s;cendant &s;he has in <HI>Turky,</HI> and &s;he employs all her Arts to continue the Peace, which the natural Inclina|tion

<P>But while &s;he lives &s;ome con&s;idera|ble time in all the&s;e Glories, and that Ambition is &s;atisfied, how will &s;he ac|quit what &s;he owes to Love?

<P>But &s;he is infinitely alarm'd by his coming to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and all her Tenderne&s;s pre&s;ents it &s;elf to her me|mory, &s;he &s;ees him &s;o amiable, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, and, in a word, &s;o de&s;er|ving of her Heart.</P>
<P>After <HI>Indamora</HI> had a&s;&s;ured her &s;elf of the Affections of the Grand Sig|nior, and that &s;he was almo&s;t ab&s;olute in <HI>Turky,</HI> &s;he commands the Liberty of tho&s;e Ladies that were taken with her, orders two Gallies for their Con|voy, and, in a word, gives them power to return, which they did ac|cordingly.

<P>IT was at a Hou&s;e of the Grand Vi&s;iers, two days Journy from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that this ungrateful Prince, the perjured <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> fir&s;t addre&s;s'd to me; he had been Hunting in the adjoyning Woods, and was come to &s;up with my Father, who was ever a real Admirer of this Prince, who did then appear to me infinitely agreeable, his Flattery, if any thing that could be &s;aid, could give me a good opinion of my &s;elf, did effect it; and though I never loved him, I had Ambition enough to per&s;uade him to an A&s;&s;urance I did, and all his addre&s;s to me that night I made agreeable; however, early the following day, he &s;et forward to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and would carry my Father with him; who, after he had furni&s;h'd all things for my Re|ception,
<PB N="70" REF="37">where, as Glorious as if I had already been Sultana, he &s;ent for me to come to him; you may ea&s;ily believe I obeyed without Reluctancy, I had the hopes of a Crown Glittering in my Eyes, and though I was extreme young, I had a haughty Ambition with me, that &s;urmounted all things, and I re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all to &s;atisfie this imperious charming Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I arrived at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> with all the Joy imaginable; I carre&s;s'd my Father, to make him continue a Di|ver&s;ion &s;o favourable to my be&s;t Incli|nations; he was full of the De&s;ign of making me Great, indeavoured it with as much Affection, as if I had been nearer to him than the Wife of his decea&s;ed Son. I found in his Palace Glory enough, to have &s;atisfied the mo&s;t immen&s;e Ambition; and, per|haps, had not I entertained hopes of being one day Sultana Queen, &s;o much Glory as I &s;aw there, would have &s;a|tiated my De&s;ires of it, not that I loved the Man that was to make me Great, but I loved the Greatne&s;s, and
<PB N="71" REF="37">was re&s;olved to be grateful to the Author of it.</P>
<P>I was one day in a fine Chamber of State in the Grand Vi&s;ier's Palace, dre&s;t in all the riche&s;t Glory of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and in a humour of being flat|ter'd, when I &s;aw the Prince introdu|ced by my Father enter it: I would have gone away out of a Mode&s;ty and Re&s;pect, had not the Grand Vi&s;ier commanded my Stay, who being im|mediately called to the Grand Signior, left the Prince alone with me. Then it was indeed I would have retired, had not the Prince ab&s;olutely re&s;ol|ved to hinder me. <HI>Ah, too charming</HI> Zayda, &s;aid he langui&s;hingly, <HI>why are you thus inexorable? Do not you yet know how fervently I adore you?</HI> This Di&s;|cour&s;e was more than I thought I ought to have heard without being di&s;plea&s;ed. <HI>Ah! my Lord,</HI> replied I, <HI>you take little Care of the Honour of an unfortunate Woman, neither do you confi|der what you oblige me to &s;uffer.</HI> This Di&s;cour&s;e, accompanied with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Tears, drew from the pa&s;&s;io|nate
<PB N="72" REF="38"><HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> &s;ome Religious Prote|&s;tations; He a&s;&s;ured me that none knew where he was, That he had left the Seraglio privately, and conducted by the Grand Vi&s;ier, had come to his Palace wholly unattended. This &s;a|tisfied, &s;ince nothing is indi&s;creet but what is known. I then permitted him to adore, flatter and prote&s;t, without interrupting him. I believe I did ne|ver more de&s;erve to be admired, and that if <HI>Zayda</HI> could look well, it was that day: I did think he render'd me but that was my due, and that my Heart de&s;erved more Homage than my Eyes. I a&s;&s;ured him, That my A&s;cendant was Glory, and that I had as much Pa&s;&s;ion for him as I was ca|pable of entertaining for any one; that it was as fervent as Ambition would permit it to be, and that he that could ever move my tenderne&s;s mu&s;t flatter my hopes, and approve of the mo&s;t ambitious De&s;ires under the Heavens, and &s;eek al&s;o to gra|tifie them.</P>

<P>The Prince &s;eem'd tran&s;ported at this Confe&s;&s;ion, he rendered Thanks to our great Prophet, for &s;hewing a a way to plea&s;e the charming <HI>Zayda;</HI> and a&s;&s;ured me, it was my fault if I was not one day Sultana Queen.</P>
<P>He then retired, and my Father entered &s;ome moments after, to whom I gave an exact Account of all that had been &s;aid; the Grand Vi&s;ier was well plea&s;ed at my Conduct, and, after having given me &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary In|&s;tructions, he ordered me to prepare my &s;elf for going to the <HI>Seraglio</HI> that night, to pay my Homage to the Sul|tana Queen; which, in effect, I did; there was then in the Pre&s;ence the young <HI>Amurath,</HI> who had been di&s;|graced for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and was but that hour reconciled to the merciful Sultan; the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> blu&s;h'd at this Di&s;cour&s;e, but <HI>Zayda</HI> continuing, left her no room to re|flect.</P>
<P>The Gallant <HI>Amurath</HI> was, in my opinion, the mo&s;t lovely of all Men; I gazed intemperately on him, and, in

The following night, when I return'd to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> he was then more than before (by my manner of Carriage,) confirmed in an opinion he was not indifferent to me, he re&s;olved not to lo&s;e my favourable Inclinations, for want of Addre&s;&s;es; and when I call'd for my Gloves, and my <HI>Barnus,</HI> he who waited behind pre&s;ented me with them, but with &s;o much amaze and trembling, that I was going to give a publick Demon&s;tration of my Pa&s;&s;ion (by a loud Cry,) to call &s;ome A&s;&s;i|&s;tance

I care&s;t him more than u&s;ual, and while I was thus flattering my &s;elf, the Grand Signior's Captain of his Guard came with expre&s;s Orders to bring <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> to the Sultan, at the Apartments of the Sultana of <HI>Barba|ry,</HI> where he then was, The Prince dur&s;t not di&s;obey, but a&s;&s;ured me, in quitting the Chamber, <HI>Nor</HI> Acmat <HI>nor Heaven could ever make him fal&s;e to me, or relinqui&s;h the holy Vows and Prote&s;ta|tions he had &s;o lately made me.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh Heavens! cried out the wronged <HI>Zayda,</HI> how unju&s;t, and how treacherous he was; As &s;oon as he had quitted the Sultan, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be again conducted where I was; I wonder how the Traytor, the per|fidious Ingrate, dur&s;t ever look on me again: He fell on his Knees before me, and with a feigned Sorrow, and
<PB N="84" REF="44">a Pa&s;&s;ion pauled with Duty, learnt me the Commands of <HI>Acmat,</HI> and how that he mu&s;t re&s;olve to obey them. He was beginning to deplore his Misfortunes, when I, all enraged with a violent de&s;pair, was &s;earching for a Dagger I u&s;ually carried with me, to have &s;tabbed to the heart the mo&s;t Criminal of men; and it would certainly have been a Plea&s;ure unex|pre&s;&s;ible, for me to have glutted my Eyes and my Rage in the Bloud of a Villain, for nothing el&s;e can atone for all his Perjuries.</P>
<P>My Poinyard, by a deplorable ill fate, was not then with me, which the more enraged me, and altogether &s;o oppre&s;t me with a fatal Weight, that quite blinded with the violence of an angry Pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;unk down on the floor. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> would have rai|&s;ed me, but I abhorred him too much to &s;ee him near me, unle&s;s it had been in my power to have then given him Death. <HI>Ah, Villain,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>if thou wilt continue to torment me, thou need|e&s;t but to tarry here; I was cur&s;t the fir&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="44">moment that I &s;aw thee, and have ever &s;ince remained &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>He endeavoured then to clear him|&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ibly he could, pro|te&s;ted he &s;till loved me, and that no|thing but a prevention of an inevita|ble Ruin of me, the Grand Vi&s;ier, and him&s;elf, could have forced him to do &s;o ill an Act. <HI>Thou oughte&s;t,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>to have let us peri&s;hed all together, ra|ther than to have been perjured, to have made the unju&s;t Sultan peri&s;h, to let the whole World be ruined, rather than have treated me thus, but &s;ince thou wert of &s;o ba&s;e a Temper as to prefer an inglorious Life before a glorious Ruin, thou oughte&s;t to expiate thy Crime by thy Death, and though thou did&s;t not love well enough, to have died to have been ju&s;t to that Pa&s;&s;ion. Be ju&s;t at lea&s;t to thy Honour, and die for thy Perjuries; go, and never let me &s;ee thee more.</HI> I turned from him then, and he left me, after ha|ving &s;aid, <HI>You are mad, I am unhappy, and I mu&s;t be gone.</HI> I was reflecting (per&s;ued <HI>Zayda</HI>) on all I had done for a Crown, how I had &s;acrificed my
<PB N="86" REF="45">Love to the Hopes of it, and how I was di&s;appointed, when you enter'd. And thus I have given you an account of this Engagement, and of the Per|juries of the mo&s;t unde&s;erving of Men.</P>
<P>Thus did <HI>Zayda</HI> fini&s;h her Relation. The Sultana <HI>Homira,</HI> in another time, would have died with Rage at the Confe&s;&s;ion &s;he made her of her being in Love with <HI>Amurath;</HI> but he had u&s;ed the Sultana too barbarou&s;ly to merit any thing of Tender from her: He had expo&s;ed her Letters, and ba&s;e|ly rendred her as ill Offices as po&s;&s;i|bly, though it was by her he made him&s;elf fir&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P><HI>Homira</HI> had learnt the whole De|&s;pair of <HI>Zayda;</HI> &s;he valued nothing now &s;he &s;aw her hopes baffled, her Ambition ruined, and all her great expectations vani&s;ht. The Sultana, though &s;he had heard particulars, could draw nothing advantagious to her de&s;igns of ruining <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> and the Grand Vi&s;ier; &s;he &s;aw &s;he had all
<PB N="87" REF="45">the Revenge this Rancountre could give her, and &s;ince &s;he failed of mur|dering ought but their Repo&s;e, &s;he triumphed in doing that; though it is a truth, &s;he had done <HI>Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;|&s;a and the fair <HI>Zayda</HI> the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Injury; and perhaps this later would have rather &s;he had robb'd her of her Life, than a Crown, which in all ap|pearance had been hers, had not the Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> di&s;covered to the Grand Signior their Engagements. <HI>Zayda</HI> did not know how much &s;he was obliged to her, but when &s;he helpt her to rail at the Prince, be|lieved her the greate&s;t of her friends, and u&s;ed her accordingly. The trea|cherous Sultana, after her Care&s;s, be|lieved &s;he would receive any Advice &s;he gave her, and fir&s;t conjured her to be her friend, as &s;he was &s;incerely hers, feign'd her Anger to <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> to all the height imaginable, and would fain per&s;uade her to the Re&s;o|lutions of &s;ome way or other to give him the Death he de&s;erved. Her Di&s;&s;imulation terminated in this; but
<PB N="88" REF="46"><HI>Zayda,</HI> who had no manner of Incli|nation for the Prince, and who, &s;ince &s;he had failed of murdering him the fir&s;t time, altered her Re&s;olutions; She con&s;idered his Death could not place the Crown &s;he had lo&s;t upon her head, and was re&s;olved to lo&s;e the thoughts of him, and to retire from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ad|vice of the Grand Vi&s;ier, who was &s;en&s;ibly di&s;plea&s;ed, but dur&s;t not ap|pear &s;o.

However &s;he goes, &s;he comes, &s;he looks about, &s;he enters all the Grottoes, and at length, in one of the mo&s;t re|tir'd ones, &s;he &s;ees a Woman alone, wrapt up in her Barnus, &s;upinely laid on one of the Banks, and reading a Letter by the help of the Moon, which lent her light enough.</P>

It was then that I found my Pa&s;&s;ion for her not ex|tinct, and yet I hated her to the death, I thought it would be an infinite of Plea&s;ure to me, to take <HI>Morat</HI>'s place, and, by con&s;equence, po&s;&s;e&s;s what &s;he treacherou&s;ly refu&s;ed me; it was to me the highe&s;t Satisfaction in the World, to think, how &s;he would re&s;ent this

<P>The fair Sultana was agitated by unexpre&s;&s;ible Di&s;quiets; &s;he returned to the Seraglio, and with a Re&s;olu|tion to write to the Religious Prince, which &s;he did, but then &s;he knows not how to have it &s;afely delivered to him.

<PB N="112" REF="58">a thou&s;and Extravagancies, which were notwith&s;tanding pardonable in a Lover.

This gave her a good Pretence; &s;he &s;eemed &s;tartled at this emotion, and opening her Eyes, &s;he clos'd 'em no more again for that time.

<P>But all this had not effected what &s;he aimed at; &s;he thinks it's now time to begin, &s;o that rai&s;ing her head with an apparent Con&s;traint, and in fainter Accents than before, with Interruptions and Tears, &s;he pro|ceeds thus to the Grand Signior.

<P><HI>Acmat</HI> believing Obedience was tho greate&s;t Te&s;timony of his Affection, went to the Anti-Chamber, where

<P>The Prince <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> having received tho&s;e Orders from the Ottoman Em|peror, was divided, if he &s;hould obey, (&s;ince the cruel Di&s;appointment the night before,) but his Charity, and his Religion, (as it ought,) &s;urmount|ed all particular Con&s;iderations, and he followed the Eunuch to her Apart|ments;

<P>The Sultan was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly pleas'd with this Relation, that from that Moment he began to treat the Prince in an extraordinary manner; he en|quired of him a thou&s;and little things, would force him to &s;tay with him, <HI>That we may</HI> (&s;ays the great <HI>Acmat) both together vi&s;it the dear</HI> Indamora, <HI>when &s;he &s;hall awake.</HI></P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>'TIs impo&s;&s;ible for me, my dear</HI> Sul|tana, <HI>to know, how it is that I came to love you &s;o tenderly as I do, ah you are more charming than ever yet I &s;aw any, and I know no torment either in this Life, or that to come, which I would not joyfully &s;ubmit to, for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you an hour; Your Conver&s;ation, your Per&s;on, your Humour, and in fine a thou&s;and other Charms, are anvaluable, and when the mo|ment comes, that I am at any time hurried from you, I would give all that I had dear be&s;ides, to continue with you, though per|haps I have pa&s;&s;ed a great many hours there, but ever my heart remains behind,

</LETTER>
<P>After this, he vi&s;ited her again; &s;he had learnt, That it was be&s;t to di&s;&s;em|ble her Rage and her Aver&s;ion, and that without it &s;he could I not be able to effect any thing con&s;iderable, &s;o that it was not difficult for the great <HI>Acmat</HI> to reconcile her in appearance to his Love; he is &s;o well &s;atisfied with it, that nothing could make him more,
<PB N="165" REF="84">and he leaves her with greater Te&s;ti|monies of his Pa&s;&s;ion, than ever he had yet done.</P>
<P>But the fatal time was now come, that <HI>Zelida</HI> was to make tho&s;e Di&s;co|veries to <HI>Acmat. Agu&s;tus</HI> (that amo|rous Prelate) had not &s;een <HI>Indamora</HI> &s;ince the night in the Garden of the Seraglio, which was an Age in Love, and which render'd her impatient, and confirm'd her in the Re&s;olves of Sacrificing all things to her love for him. <HI>Zelida</HI> had no more te&s;timony of their Commercce than before; but with that &s;he adventures to the Sultan, pro&s;trates her &s;elf at his feet, (as the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Slaves is,) gave him a full account of what <HI>Homira</HI> had be|fore confu&s;edly related to him, put the Letter of the Chri&s;tian Prince in|to his hands, and retired.</P>
<P>The Sultan read it with an infinite &s;urprize, he weigh'd all Circum&s;tan|ces, and could conclude nothing; he endeavoured to clear the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and his Pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pir'd him with Eloquence in her Defence; but
<PB N="166" REF="85">then he would &s;ay her de&s;ire of quit|ting the Seraglio was a Proof of her Indifferencie to him, and <HI>Zelida</HI>'s Words, when &s;he recounted <HI>Indamo|ra</HI>'s Indi&s;po&s;ition, di&s;turb'd him more than all. Says that Slave, <HI>I will not tell your Highne&s;s &s;he feigned, I am not &s;ure of that, but this I am very certain of, &s;he treated the Prelate very different from what you expected; and had I not known to the contrary, I &s;hould have believed it</HI> Acmat, <HI>and no other, e&s;pecially a Reli|gious Prince.</HI> This, and the Letter he had, and which was found by <HI>Zelida</HI> in the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI>'s Robes, confus'd him; he did not at all &s;u&s;pect the Fidelity of that Slave, however he will have the Opinion of <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;&s;a;</HI> &s;ome of the Eunuchs are &s;ent in &s;earch of him, whom they return with. <HI>Acmat</HI> bids him be ju&s;t and free with him, (as he was his Monarch and his Friend) and advi&s;e him in what he &s;hould believe, and what he ought to do. He then read the Letter, and recounted all to him, and in &s;hort re|ceived his Opinion, <HI>That there was no|thing
<PB N="167" REF="85">in it, and that the Sultana</HI> Homi|ra <HI>had bribed the Slave to act as &s;he did.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Signior was enclined e|nough to believe this; but con&s;ider|ing the Grand Vi&s;ier was the greate&s;t Friend the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> had in <HI>Turky,</HI> he &s;ent him away without re|&s;olving on any thing.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier was no &s;ooner out of the Seraglio, than that he &s;ends for his Daughter to him, (who was returned to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and had e|&s;pou&s;ed <HI>Amurath.) Mahomet Ba&s;&s;a</HI> commands her to go to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and give her an account of all, and to advi&s;e her to throw her &s;elf at the Sultan's Feet, tell of <HI>A|gu&s;tus</HI>'s Love to her, and make a fal&s;e Confe&s;&s;ion of her Cruelty, her Re&s;o|lutions of not returning his Pa&s;&s;ion, and an Order &s;he mu&s;t de&s;ire from the great <HI>Acmat</HI> for his Bani&s;hment, as a Reward for his Pre&s;umption. <HI>She mu&s;t not con&s;ider her Love for the Prince</HI> (&s;ays the Grand Vi&s;ier) <HI>any farther than it &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave his Life: They
<PB N="168" REF="86">mu&s;t both die, if &s;he does not take that Cour&s;e I advi&s;e her to.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zayda</HI> fail'd not of obeying the Orders of <HI>Mahomet Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> and in &s;hort di&s;pos'd the Sultane&s;s <HI>Indamora</HI> to make that Relation to the Emperour. She ha&s;tens then to the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Apartment, agitated by a thou&s;and Fears; and had not a thou&s;and things diverted her from &s;o horrid a Re&s;olution, &s;he would have Ponyarded him, rather than make a Confe&s;&s;ion of that nature. How|ever &s;he comes, ca&s;ts her&s;elf at his Feet, covers her Face with a Vail, &s;heds a torrent of tears, confe&s;&s;es the Pre&s;umption of the Prince <HI>Agu&s;tus,</HI> his Writing to her in a manner &s;o arro|gant, her Grief for lo&s;ing the Letter before the <HI>Sultan</HI> had &s;een it, and in a word, her de&s;ires of having him Ba|ni&s;hed; nothing el&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, could &s;atisfie her, or atone for his Crimes.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the improbability of this Relation of her Cruelty, (&s;ince the Letter <HI>Acmat</HI> had of <HI>Tiridate</HI>'s was writ in a different &s;tyle) yet the <HI>Sul|tan,</HI> who loved her tenderly, and all
<PB N="169" REF="86">ea&s;ie as he was to tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, he took her up from the ground, &s;pake &s;uch tender things to her, as none but one &s;o much in Love as he could, af|ter a &s;u&s;picion of that nature; howe|ver he lo&s;t for &s;ome Moments all man|ner of Reflection, and abandoned him|&s;elf entirely to a great Joy, which was the more &s;en&s;ible &s;ince it &s;ucceeded &s;uch cruel Apprehen&s;ions; and whether he wholly believed her or no, yet certain it is he a&s;&s;ured her he did: He return'd her the Letter of Prince <HI>Tiridate,</HI> recounted to her all that had been told him, care&s;&s;es her more than ever, conducted her back to her Apart|ment, and a&s;&s;ured her, <HI>He had not quitted her &s;o &s;oon, but that he was going to put her Orders in execution for the ba|ni&s;hing that ingrateful Prince;</HI> which he immediately did, and cau&s;ed the oc|ca&s;ion of it to be made publick.</P>
<P>The Prince was tran&s;ported with De&s;pair and Rage at this accident; he came to <HI>Zayda,</HI> threw all the Letters he had received from <HI>Indamora</HI> to her, and de&s;ired &s;he would do him that Ju&s;tice to expo&s;e them to the abu&s;ed
<PB N="170" REF="87">Sultan, e&s;pecially the la&s;t he had re|ceived from her, &s;ince their Interview in the Grotto, which he obliged <HI>Zay|da</HI> to read; it was thus.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>See there, &s;ays the Prince, dete&s;ting <HI>Indamora</HI>'s Crimes, (and after <HI>Zayda</HI> had read it) &s;ee how &s;he de&s;erves to be treated. <HI>Zayda</HI> u&s;ed her Endea|vours
<PB N="171" REF="87">to calm him, and it was with much difficulty &s;he per&s;uaded him to continue at the Grand Vi&s;ier's Palace, till &s;he &s;hould return from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> where &s;he was going.</P>
<P>The Intere&s;ts of <HI>Indamora</HI> were too near hers, to neglect &s;erving her in this point; &s;he came then to the <HI>Sul|tana</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> who was drowned in rage; nothing (&s;he &s;aid) but the life of the <HI>Sultan,</HI> &s;hould &s;atisfie her: Her De&s;igns of Revenge (&s;he added) were noble, and &s;he would, for once, be greatly cruel. <HI>Zayda</HI> did not much reflect on what &s;he heard, &s;he only minded the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> how much her Friend &s;he was, re&s;tor'd her the Letters, and in this &s;erved the Prince <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> better than by obeying his Orders; <HI>Indamora</HI> immediately threw 'em to the flames, tenderly Em|braced <HI>Zayda,</HI> and yielded to go to the Grand Vi&s;iers Palace with her, there to &s;ee the unfortunate <HI>Agu&s;tus;</HI> &s;he hated her &s;elf for what &s;he had done, and the Sultan much more for it; &s;he wept to <HI>Tiridate,</HI> calm'd his rage, by a&s;|&s;uring him, that nothing but to &s;ave
<PB N="172" REF="88">him from expiring, by the Orders of the unju&s;t <HI>Sultan,</HI> could have made her guilty of &s;uch a &s;in; &s;he a&s;&s;ures him &s;he will attone for it by an action worthy her Love, and that &s;he was going to endeavour, by one blow, to attain to her own Liberty, and &s;hare his Bani&s;hment with him. Mean time, till &s;he &s;hould be able to effect what &s;he had promi&s;ed, he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Orders that had been given for his Exile; that he &s;hould retire him|&s;elf to <HI>Italy,</HI> till &s;he &s;hould order his Return. As for her, &s;he &s;aid, after her departure from <HI>Turky,</HI> &s;he would go to <HI>Germany,</HI> and to the Emperor's Court, and u&s;e all her endeavours for his Return from that Exile, or if &s;he &s;hould not be able to effect it, &s;he would however end her Life with him, &s;ince nothing but Death was of force enough to extingui&s;h the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had for him. <HI>Agu&s;tus</HI> returned this tenderne&s;s; and after having given reciprocally their Vows of Loving for ever, they prepared to leave one another, but with &s;o many tran&s;ports of Sorrow, Grief and Pa&s;&s;ion, that they were not
<PB N="173" REF="88">capable of &s;peaking; and the Prince, who was hurried away by his cruel De&s;tiny, left the <HI>Sultana</HI> &s;wooning in the Arms of <HI>Zayda,</HI> to whom he ren|der'd a thou&s;and Expre&s;&s;ions of Gra|titude, and left <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Tur|ky,</HI> with an inconceivable Regret.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sultana</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> (after her Recovery from her Swoon) learnt the Departure of the Prince with a vexatious Sorrow; but &s;he mu&s;t dry her Tears, and prepare for her Re|turn to the <HI>Seraglio:</HI> She will be fatal|ly revenged, but not yet, &s;he has not an opportunity of doing it without Noi&s;e; &s;he is con&s;trained (to take off all &s;u&s;picion) to render her Acknow|ledgments to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> for bani&s;hing <HI>Agu&s;tus;</HI> &s;he is al&s;o forc'd to di&s;&s;emble more than ever; &s;he appears gay when &s;he is mortally afflicted, and tender to the Sultan, while &s;he is &s;earching for a way to be reveng'd on him. She be|comes cruel, and, Oh, Horror! at la&s;t re&s;olves on the mo&s;t barbarous of Mur|ders; her Re&s;entments have a fatal ter|mination, and her Rage &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that nothing but his Death could
<PB N="174" REF="89">repair the Injuries he had done her, and render her again happy in her Love; &s;he did not reflect on the Great|ne&s;s of her Crime, (her dear Prelate had Power to ab&s;olve her of it,) and tho&s;e in Love never believe that thing a Sin, which is &s;o highly &s;erviceable to their Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Sultana <HI>Homira</HI> (mean time,) was full enough of Rage, to &s;ee how <HI>Indamora</HI> had prevented her de&s;igns, but &s;he has addre&s;s to pa&s;s over her regret, &s;he re&s;olves now no more to endeavour the revenging her &s;elf, &s;ince &s;he has &s;o continually failed in it, but &s;he will invert all to a de&s;ign of grati|fying her tender Inclinations, and that &s;he will care for nothing beyond ma|king new Conque&s;ts; and &s;he does not now &s;eem to be &s;orry, the Grand Vi|&s;ier had the la&s;t Revenge, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw by it his Love for her was not ex|tingui&s;h'd, and tho&s;e of a pa&s;&s;ionate Character, had very &s;eldom an ill Re|ception from her in the end.</P>
<P>But whil'&s;t &s;he has thus di&s;po&s;ed of her &s;elf, and that the whole Ottoman Empire enjoy'd a Tranquility beyond
<PB N="175" REF="89">all Example, the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> will di&s;turb it; and having got a &s;low Poy&s;on, &s;he conveys it into a Gla&s;s where the Sultan was to drink, he &s;up|ped with her that fatal Night, and whil'&s;t he is more admired than ever by all the World, he falls by the ex|treme malice of a Woman, and a Woman &s;o dear to him; he drank the Poy&s;on, and returned very well to his own Apartment, and does not feel the effects of it 'till the following day, then it was that he was torn with ex|tremity of Torture, and that all the Court de&s;paired of his Life, but he linguered yet &s;ome few days longer; there was none, that dur&s;t &s;ay, he was poy&s;oned, and if any &s;u&s;pected it, they did not make their opinion publick, it pa&s;&s;ed for a dreadful Malady, which he had before been afflicted with, and he died (in the opinion of all,) of that Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>During his Sickne&s;s, he expre&s;s'd a tender regret for parting with his dear Sultana, (as he would call her,) but his great Weakne&s;s, and the publick Affairs, together with that of his Soul, &s;o em|ploy'd
<PB N="176" REF="90">his ha&s;ty time, that he &s;aw the Sultana of <HI>Barbary</HI> but very &s;eldom.</P>
<P>By his Death <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> was Grand Signior, (a thing never before known in <HI>Turky,</HI>) the Brothers being always Slain, but <HI>Acmat</HI> having no Children, and being one of the be&s;t of Princes, pre&s;erved him to &s;ucceed him; and at his quitting the World, he tenderly required from his Kindne&s;s, a Prote|ction for the Sultana of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> (now the Sultan,) had not long po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Crowns and Title, then that his Nephew <HI>O&s;men</HI> re|bels again&s;t him; but that being not my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I mu&s;t pa&s;s it over to come to the Sultana of <HI>Barbary,</HI> &s;he mourned &s;trictly for <HI>Acmat,</HI> and was very well plea&s;ed, that &s;he was no man|ner of way &s;u&s;pected (nor, in a word, any el&s;e,) for the murdering of him.</P>
<P>After her fir&s;t mourning, &s;he implo|red, and received, Permi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha</HI> to retire from <HI>Turky;</HI> which, in effect, &s;he did, not long after, with tho&s;e de|&s;igns which we have already related, in her Orders to the Prince <HI>Tiridate Agu&s;tus</HI> at his departure from <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI></P>
