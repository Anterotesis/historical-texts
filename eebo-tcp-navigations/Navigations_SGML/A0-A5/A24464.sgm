<P><HI>LOchaber,</HI> the pre&s;ent Retreat of that Rebel <HI>Dundee,</HI> was Originally and Properly called <HI>Abre,</HI> which according to the Judg|ment of the Learned <HI>Buchanan,</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>Harbour,</HI> for that the Sea comes in there into a large <HI>Bay,</HI> which re&s;embles a &s;tanding Pool, or rather a Lake; whence tho&s;e of the <HI>Low-Lands</HI> that &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> call not only that <HI>Bay</HI> of the Sea, but likewi&s;e the whole Country round it, impro|perly by the name of <HI>Lochquhabre.</HI> It is bounded with the <HI>Deucaledonian</HI> Sea on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> near to the Shire of <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> on the <HI>North Baldenoch,</HI> and Port of <HI>Murray</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and part of <HI>Athol, Broadalbine,</HI> and <HI>Lorn</HI> from the <HI>South,</HI> to the <HI>South We&s;t</HI> Parts; yet a Country as fertile as any in tho&s;e Parts, pro|ducing plenty of Corn and Pa&s;ture, and very plea&s;ant, by rea&s;on of &s;hady Woods, and &s;tore of Rivers, and Springs, It is as plenteous in Fi&s;h as mo&s;t Countries in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well River Fi&s;h as Sea-Fi&s;h. It has ridges of almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Moun|tains along it; &s;o that 'tis an ea&s;ie matter for a few Per&s;ons to defend them&s;elves there again&s;t a great Number af Per&s;ons who are Ignorant of its Avenues. It has been for many years a Ne&s;t of Thieves and Robbers, who u&s;ed to go in Bodies together, into &s;everal of the Neighbouring Coun|tries, and drive away all their Cattle, and take with them what they could ea&s;ily carry.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e &s;ome People here are at a lo&s;s, when they meet with the Word <HI>CLAN,</HI> I &s;hall briefly inform the Reader, that the Import of that Word is no more than <HI>Family,</HI> or <HI>Tribe;</HI> and the Chief of it is Wor&s;hipped by the Inferior &s;ort of People, as if he were a Demi-god. And in|deed formerly they had great rea&s;on to &s;tand by him, for if he was Attainted of Rebellion, all his Va&s;&s;als and Tenents were forfeited with him, as if they had been guilty of the &s;ame Crime, tho' they were never &s;o Innocent of it. But the Convention of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath of late, (to their un&s;peakable Commendation,) Repealed that Act as unrea&s;onable, which has prevented a great ma|ny's going in to <HI>Dundee,</HI> who, had the former Act been in being, would have been nece&s;&s;itated to fol|low their Chief, &s;eeing they had no other ways to pre&s;erve their E&s;tate, but their Chiefs over|coming his Enemies. And this may well be &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the rea&s;on why none of Duke
<PB REF="2"><HI>de Gordon</HI>'s Va&s;&s;als and Tenants joined him, they being mo&s;tly Prote&s;tants, and &s;o by that Act of the Convention freed from all the hazard of be|ing forfeited, which they were formerly under, upon their Superiors being declared a Traitor.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the <HI>Clans</HI> that joined him, were the <HI>Macklenes,</HI> and the <HI>Mackdonalds;</HI> the former, 'tis well known, have lived in Rebel|lion and Robbery for a great part of the late King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Reign. And as for the latter, they are all, or mo&s;t, <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and 'tis well known, they would do any thing to advance Mo|ther-Church's Intere&s;t. But it may not be ami&s;s to give a brief De&s;cription of the&s;e Two I&s;lands, which the&s;e Two <HI>CLANS</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t. The <HI>Mack|leans</HI> Live in the I&s;le of <HI>Mut,</HI> 'tis towards the Southermo&s;t parts of <HI>Lockguhabre,</HI> is Twenty Four Miles long, and of the &s;ame bredth; it is Crag|gy, and very Fruitful in Corn; it has many Woods, and great Numbers of Deer, and a &s;afe Harbour. On the We&s;t it has Two Rivers that abound in Salmon, with others &s;maller, and Two Lakes, in each of which is an I&s;land with a Ca|&s;tle in it. The Sea runneth in it, and maketh Four Bays, all which are well &s;tored with Her|ring. This I&s;land lies not far from <HI>Argile-&s;hire,</HI> which is a Barren Countrey, and bad for an Ar|my to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in.</P>
<P>The other I&s;land, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Mackdo|nalds,</HI> lies off of the Northern parts of <HI>Lockguha|bre,</HI> it is called the <HI>Skie;</HI> that is to &s;ay, a <HI>Wing;</HI> but by the Ancient <HI>Scots</HI> it was called <HI>Skianack,</HI> i. e. <HI>Winged;</HI> for that the Promontories, between which the Sea runs in, repre&s;ent Wings di&s;played. It is the greate&s;t of all the I&s;lands about <HI>Scotland,</HI> being Forty Two Miles in length, and in &s;ome places Eight, in other Twelve, in bredth; it a|bounds in Mountains, and the&s;e with Woods, and the Woods abound in Pa&s;tures; the Valleys are Fruitful of Corn and Cattle, and e&s;pecially with Hor&s;es. It is Watered with Five Rivers that are repleni&s;ht with Salmon, together with &s;e|veral little ones. The Sea entring it maketh ma|ny Bays, Three great ones, and Thirteen &s;maller, which afford plenty of Herrings. It has likewi&s;e a Lake of &s;weet Water, and Five Ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t that joined him, they are ve|ry incon&s;iderable, and Per&s;ons who have no Principle at all, but only that they may have occa&s;ion to Plunder the Countreys where they come, it being the delight of many of tho&s;e &s;ort of People to Plunder the Countreys where they Live; and were never &s;o &s;evearly look'd after, as in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s time, tho' it co&s;t him &s;ome time, and more Men, before he could Re|duce them. They are all in general a Barbarous &s;ort of People, and have little or no &s;en&s;e of Re|ligion, and if any, it inclines to Popery; they have much the &s;ame Language with the Native <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> there being no greater difference betwixt them, than betwixt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Low-Landers.</P>
<P>They are Per&s;ons that will not &s;tand the &s;hock of a Battle in their own Countrey, becau&s;e they know how to make their e&s;cape by tho&s;e Avenues where &s;trangers cannot &s;o ea&s;ily follow them, e&s;pecially Hor&s;e; and as for Foot, few are able to pur&s;ue them, they being very &s;wift in Run|ning.</P>
<P>We doubt not but we &s;hall quickly hear of their Defeat; for the Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> is gone from the <HI>We&s;t High-Lands</HI> with a Detachment of their Maje&s;ties Forces, and a great Number of his Va&s;|&s;als and Tenants to Hem them in on the We&s;t.</P>
