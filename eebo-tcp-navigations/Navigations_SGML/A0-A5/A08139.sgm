<P>By the &s;ame Letters we learne likewi&s;e, how that the Fleet which is to Sayle towards <HI>Bra&s;iel,</HI> to take the Bay <HI>Todos Los Sanctos</HI> again, was not likely to be &s;oone ready; and that they hoped there that the Inhabita~ts of <HI>Bra&s;iel</HI> &s;hal recouer it them&s;elues, before their Fleete commeth there.</P>

<P>SInce my la&s;t Letter to you, we haue beene at <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> where my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador went to ac|company the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> and the French Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and the Venetian Amba&s;&s;ador, to treat and negotiate with the great Con&s;table of <HI>France</HI> concerning the pre&s;ent affaires in the&s;e parts, the Con&s;table being accompanied with <HI>Mon&s;: le Mare&s;chall de Crequi,</HI> and with <HI>Mon&s;eur de Bullion;</HI> the fir&s;t being one of the greate&s;t men in all France, the la&s;t is priuy Councellor to the French King, being both annexed in commi&s;&s;i|on with the Con&s;table, and both in quality of ex|traordinary Amba&s;&s;adors.</P>

<P>This is all I can &s;ay concerning the negotiation, time will &s;hew vs the event of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: but one thing I feare much, the Ie&s;uiticall predomi|nant power. <HI>Fiat voluntas Domini.</HI></P>

<P>VVE receiued Letters from <HI>Bergen op Zoom</HI> bearing dare this twelfth of Nouember, 1624, that the handmaid of Warre, and &s;courge of great armies, a cruell Pe&s;tilence, rageth and reigneth in his Excellencies armie in the Nether|lands: by the contagion whereof more haue pe|ri&s;hed then by the enemies &s;word or bullet. It doth not onely rage in the field, as at <HI>Ro&s;endale</HI> and <HI>Longstraten,</HI> where the Prince of Oranges forces lye encamped, but the next good townes feele a portion of this calamity, as <HI>Breda, Bergen op Zoom,</HI> and others.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>The Prince of Orange, to the great griefe of euery good man, was grieuou&s;ly &s;icke of this ma|lady, but God be thanked, hee is rea&s;onable well recouered, to the vn&s;peakable comfort of al tho&s;e who fight vnder his banners.</P>
<P>The enemies did much reioyce at the report of this di&s;a&s;ter: and it was giuen out in the Spa|ni&s;h quarters, that either he was dead, or el&s;e &s;o de&s;perately &s;icke, that hee was pa&s;t all recouery. <HI>Quae volumus, facile credimus:</HI> It being an ea&s;ie matter to beleeue tho&s;e things which our wils with affectation and earne&s;tne&s;&s;e doe de&s;ire. But yet he liues, and long may liue to fight the battels of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and defend the in|nocent from the &s;word of the oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>But &s;ee how the Sunne&s;hine of this ioy is &s;ud|denly ouer&s;hadowed with a cloud of &s;orrow for my Lord <HI>Wriothe&s;ly,</HI> &s;onne and heyre to that ho|nourable Lord my Lord of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who went ouer in this la&s;t expedition into the Ne|therlands, Captaine of a foot Company vnder his fathers command, being Coronell of one of the foure new Regiments, fell &s;icke at <HI>Ro&s;cndale</HI> in the Princes Leaguer; and to auoid the di&s;com|modities of the field, he retired him&s;elfe to <HI>Ber|gen op Zoom,</HI> a towne not farre di&s;tant, there to v&s;e the be&s;t meanes he could for the recouery and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of his health.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9">
<P>But marke how Gods prouidence ouer&s;wayeth mens proui&s;ions and purpo&s;es. He had not lyen there many dayes vnder the tortures of this con|tagion, but he exchanged this mortall life into immortality, decea&s;ing vpon Sunday la&s;t was a &s;ennight, it being the &s;euenth of Nouember. His noble father comming to vi&s;it his &s;on to <HI>Bergen,</HI> fell &s;icke of this Pe&s;tilence al&s;o, and what with the violence of the &s;ickne&s;&s;e, and the griefe of mind for his &s;onnes decea&s;e, hee gaue vp his glo|rious and now glorified gho&s;t into the hands of his Creator, the Wedne&s;day following, the tenth of Nouember.</P>
<P>The&s;e two, both the father and the &s;onne, wee cannot too much condole nor mourne for their lo&s;&s;es, they being as truly honorable in their con|ditions, as they were in their dignities and cal|lings.</P>
<P>My old Lord in his younger yeares had tooke a ta&s;te of the French and Netherland warres, and after that he was thought worthy by Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous memory, to be Generall of her hor&s;e in that expedition, which was made vn|der the conduct of the Earle of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> again&s;t the Earle of <HI>Tiroan,</HI> and other Rebels of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he caried him&s;elfe brauely and vnblemi&s;h|ed. He was a braue Souldier, both for his execu|tion and knowledge, and likewi&s;e learned, as hee was military and valiant.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<P>Be&s;ides he was a great fauorer and <HI>Mecaenas</HI> vnto Armes and Artes, and a liberall acknowledger and rewarder of tho&s;e who could challenge any dignity from the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>His Sonne was the True Image and Chara|cter of his Father, &s;o that without wronging others by way of comparri&s;on, he was as hope|full as any young Noble-man in Chri&s;tendome what&s;oeuer. But Is feare me that my poore Panegericke, and commendation doth rather di&s;|grace them: then dignifie their Worthyne&s;&s;e; wherefore I will fall from it and a little looke vpon Marquis <HI>Spinolaes:</HI> Leagur, where you &s;hall &s;ee the &s;ickne&s;&s;e raine as bad, as in our Mauritian Quarters.</P>

<P>To aggriuate which calamities, the Marques his Souldiers runne away by parties euery day, their pay falls &s;hort, and their Conuoyes which bring their Ammunition bread and other victualls, are dayly cut off by the States Souldiers comming from <HI>Ro&s;endale, Long &s;traten</HI> and el&s;ewhere.

There is likewi&s;e a great impre&s;&s;e and &s;tay of &s;hipping of &s;euerall Countries, as Engli&s;h, Scots, French, and Ea&s;terlins to the great griefe and di&s;content of their poore mai&s;ters and owners, who are like to &s;uffer great detriment and lo&s;&s;e by this meanes.

But tho&s;e who&s;e iudgements are mo&s;t curious: Iudge the&s;e prepara|tions to be made again&s;t the Hollander for the re|couering of <HI>Todos los Sanstos</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;ilia,</HI> which we may the &s;ooner be indu&s;t to beleeue, if we &s;hall but once con&s;ider, how loath the Spaniards are to part with any thing which they haue once ap|propriated and made their owne.</P>
